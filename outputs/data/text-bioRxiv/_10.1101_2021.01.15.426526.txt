Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 pandemic, is one of the
largest positive strand RNA viruses. Here we developed a simplified SPLASH assay
and comprehensively mapped the in vivo RNA-RNA interactome of SARS-CoV-2
RNA during the viral life cycle. We observed canonical and alternative structures
including 3’-UTR and 5’-UTR, frameshifting element (FSE) pseudoknot and
genome cyclization in cells and in virions. We provide direct evidence of interactions
between Transcription Regulating Sequences (TRS-L and TRS-Bs), which facilitate
discontinuous transcription. In addition, we reveal alternative short and long distance
arches around FSE, forming a “high-order pseudoknot” embedding FSE, which might
help ribosome stalling at frameshift sites. More importantly, we found that within
virions, while SARS-CoV-2 genome RNA undergoes intensive compaction, genome
cyclization is weakened and genome domains remain stable. Our data provides a
structural basis for the regulation of replication, discontinuous transcription and
translational frameshifting, describes dynamics of RNA structures during life cycle of
SARS-CoV-2, and will help to develop antiviral strategies.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, has caused more
than 1.5 million deaths worldwide up till the time of submission. Although many
efforts have been devoted to control the disease, vaccines are being approved for
emergency use, but the pandemic is far from being under control. Therefore, there is
an urgent need to understand basic molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the broad family of coronaviruses. It is a positive-sense
single-stranded RNA virus, with a single linear RNA segment of approximately
30,000 bases [1].
Coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA synthesis includes two different processes:
continuous genome replication that yields multiple copies of genomic RNA (gRNA),

and discontinuous transcription of a collection of subgenomic mRNAs (sgRNAs, or
sgmRNAs) that encode the viral structural and accessory proteins [2, 3]. The
transcription process is controlled by transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs)
located at the 3 end of the leader sequence (TRS-L) and preceding each viral gene
′

(TRS-B), and requires base-pairing between the core sequence of TRS-L (CS-L) and the
nascent minus strand complementary to each CS-B (cCS-B), allowing for leader-body

joining [2, 4, 5]. A three-step working model of coronavirus transcription was
suggested [2, 6], which implies that long-distance RNA-RNA interactions are
required prior to template switch. Long-distance interactions between B motif (B-M)
and its complementary motif (cB-M), and between proximal element (pE) and distal
element (dE), are important for forming high-order structures promoting
discontinuous RNA synthesis during N sgmRNA transcription in the TGEV
coronavirus [5]. However, the motifs involved in these interactions are not conserved
in beta-coronaviruses, and it is not known if similar interactions contribute to
transcription of other sgmRNAs. Therefore, although it is widely assumed that TRS-L
interacts with cCS-B, there has been no experimental evidence for direct interactions
between TRS-L and TRS-Bs.
Functional studies have revealed the importance of RNA secondary structures for
viral replication, transcription and translation [7-9]. One unique feature of the
coronavirus is frameshifting in ORF1ab, giving rise to RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRP) and other proteins in ORF1b. The structure of the SARS-CoV
FSE (whose sequence differs from the SARS-CoV-2 FSE by just one nucleotide) was
solved by NMR to be a three-stem pseudoknot [10], and was supposed to play key
roles in translational control of ORF1b [11]. Genome-wide strategies to chemically
probe RNA structure in cells made in vivo SARS-CoV-2 RNA structure analysis
available [12-15]. Recently, alternative conformations of the frameshift element (FSE)
were derived from in-cell SHAPE/DMS-MaP seq data [14, 15]. Although these
methods provided insight into cis-acting RNA structures regulating important
biological processes of virus life cycle, they could not elucidate long distance
interactions. Additionally, short- and long-distance interactions within the
SARS-CoV-2 RNA were described using the COMRADES and vRIC-seq methods.
Importantly, Ziv et al. discovered networks of both genomic RNA (gRNA) and

subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) interactions by applying specific probes to pull down
each RNA species, and Cao et al reconstructed structures in virions[16]. However, all
of these experiments were performed in a specific stage of the virus life cycle. So,
there is need to directly compare structures from different stages to investigate their
dynamics and functional relevance during the whole life cycle.
In this study, to comprehensively map RNA-RNA interactions of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
both in cells and in virions, we simplified sequencing of psoralen crosslinked, ligated,
and selected hybrids (SPLASH) [17] based on proximity ligation, with three major
differences: 1) RNase III was used to fragment RNA as in PARIS [18], this treatment
makes fragmented RNA ends compatible for T4 RNA ligase, 2) T4 PNK treatment is
omitted , 3) the purified ligation products were directly subjected to a commercial
pico-input strand-specific RNA-seq library construction kit. The major purpose of
these modifications is to make the protocol more suitable for low amount of virion
RNAs. To investigate the dynamics in RNA structure during life cycle of
SARS-CoV-2 virus, we performed simplified SPLASH on early, late infected cells
and supernatant virions.
Here we provide direct experimental evidence of comprehensive TRS-L interactions
with TRS-B regions of sgRNAs, and identify and validate novel sgRNAs by
analyzing additional TRS-L interaction peaks. We found multiple alternative
interactions mediated by FSE, providing structural basis for ribosome stalling. In
addition, we showed that both proximal and distal genome RNA-RNA interactions
are strengthened, while sgRNAs mediated interactions are significantly reduced in
virions, suggesting thorough compaction of genome RNA in virions. Interestingly,
although TRS-L mediated interactions including genome cyclization are weakened,
interactions between TRS-L and ORF S are strengthened in later phase of infection
cells and mature virions, which may contribute to rapid transcription of sgRNAs. Our
data provides a comprehensive overview of relationships between SARS-CoV-2 RNA
structure and key processes of virus life cycle, such as replication, discontinuous
transcription and translation.

Results
Overview of short- and long-range RNA-RNA interactions of
SARS-Cov-2
We developed a simplified SPLASH protocol to capture RNA-RNA interactions in
the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Briefly, the biological samples are first stabilized by
Psoralen-PEG3-Biotin cross-linking, followed by RNase III treatment, proximity
ligation, library preparation, and high throughput sequencing. Samples were collected
from different phases of the SARS-CoV-2 virus life cycle to infer the dynamic
structure of viral RNA at different stages. In the early stage of infection, we collected
virus-infected Vero cells (C), in which cytopathic effect (CPE) was not observed. At a
later stage, when 70% of cells underwent CPE, we collected the cell culture
supernatant and harvested mature virus particles (V) and, at the same time used
freeze-thaw methods to lyse the cells (L) to collect the cell and virus RNA (Figure
1A). The major steps and corresponding RNA are shown in Figure 1A. The ligated
RNA fragments could form both 5’-3’ and 3’-5’ chimeras [19] (Figure 1C and
Figure 1D). Pearson correlation analysis of chimera counts between biological
replicates indicated high reproducibly of experiments (Figure 1B and Supplementary
Figure S1A and S1B). Chimeric signals were significantly higher in ligated than in
non-ligated samples (Figure 1C and supplementary table 1) As documented by others
[20, 21], we also observed weak chimeric signals in non-ligated samples. Counts of
chimeras in ligated and non-ligated samples were correlated, particularly in the C
sample (Figure S1C~E), consistent with the idea that chimeras in non-ligated samples
may due to endogenous ligation activity derived from host cells.

Structures of UTRs and genome cyclization
The 5’-UTRs of coronaviruses contain five evolutionarily conserved stem-loop
structures (denoted SL1–SL5) that are essential for genome replication and
discontinuous transcription [8, 22, 23]. In our data, all five stems are supported by
chimeras (Figure S2A and S2B). Notably, SL1~SL3 are stronger in cells than in

virions, possibly indicating that these stem loops form more alternative structures in
cells. (i.e TRS-L: TRS-B, or genome cyclization which will be discussed below). SL4

is weaker Figure S2A , supporting the notion that SL4 might function as a structural
spacer [24].
The 3’-UTR contains a bulged stem-loop (BSL), hyper-variable region (HVR)
comprising a conserved octonucleotide sequence and the stem-loop II-like motif
(S2M), which are essential for sgRNA synthesis in MHV [7, 25, 26]. All of these
structures could be detected in our data. Notably, the pseudoknot in the 3’-UTR had
fewer chimeras, whereas S2M had strong signal. Therefore, we identified an
alternative 3’-UTR structure in the S2M region (Figure S2C), similar to a recently
reported structure [13].
In the contact matrices, we also found interactions formed by 5’-end and 3’-end of
the SARS-CoV-2 genome, indicating genome cyclization (Figure 1C and Figure S2E
and S2F), which was previously described [27]. Interestingly, we found additional
base pairing at genome cyclization sites (Figure S2F), which suggests that SL4 in
5’-UTR is also involved in cyclization processes. Notably, genome cyclization is
reduced in virions (Figure S2E). Genome cyclization was also described in other
viruses, including flaviviruses [28], and involved in replicase recruitment at least in
Dengue virus and Zika virus [9]. Considering dynamics of genome cyclization upon
packaging and releasing, we speculate that genome cyclization is involved in
replication and/or packaging. Perturbation of genome cyclization might offer an
interesting avenue to target SARS-CoV-2 replication.

Long distance interactions between TRS-L and TRS-B regions
Although RNA proximity ligation generates chimeric reads indicative of RNA-RNA
interactions, cells also contain many spliced transcripts, or in the case of
coronavirus-infected cells, sgRNAs, that resemble chimeras produced by proximity
ligation because they originate from disjoint regions of the genome. To correctly
identify RNA-RNA interactions, it is therefore essential to filter chimeras that result
from splicing or discontinuous transcription. In previous studies, filtering was
performed by mapping reads to a database of known transcripts, and removing reads

mapped to known splice junctions [29]Ramani, 2015, 26237516;Lu, 2016, 27180905}.
However, SARS-CoV-2 produces an extreme diversity of sgRNAs [3], many of
which are not yet annotated, rendering this approach impractical. Instead, we
empirically assessed the characteristics of chimeric reads found in a published
RNA-Seq dataset from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells [3], which we assumed to
represent sgRNAs rather than RNA-RNA interactions.
We identified three characteristics that differentiated most sgRNA chimeras found in
RNA-Seq from bona-fide proximity ligation chimeras: (1) sgRNAs were ligated
almost exclusively in the 5'-3' orientation (i.e. the 5'-proximal fragment of the
genome corresponded to the 5'-proximal fragment of the chimeric read), whereas
RNA proximity ligation chimeras can be ligated in the 5'-3' orientation (also known
as inline, forward, or regularly gapped), and 3'-5' orientation (also known as
inverted, reverse, or chiastic) (reviewed in [19]); (2) the junctions between arms of
chimeras were precisely localised in sgRNAs, whereas ligation sites in proximity
ligation were variable, due to the random nuclease digestion step used in proximity
ligation [30]; (3) sgRNA chimeras typically included regions of homology between
TRS-L and TRS-B sides of the chimera [31], whereas proximity ligation chimeras
typically include no such regions [30]. Adjustment of the maximum gap/overlap
setting in our analysis pipeline, hyb, allows detection (gmax=20, "relaxed pipeline")
or removal (gmax=4, "stringent pipeline") of most sgRNA chimeras in RNA-Seq data,
while proximity ligation chimeras are detected with both settings (Supplementary
table1). Notably, chimeras detected with the relaxed pipeline are almost all in
5'-3'orientation (Figure S3B), and junction sites are highly localised (Figure S3C
and S3D). We therefore used the stringent pipeline to analyse proximity ligation data
while filtering away contaminating sgRNAs.
In order to identify RNA-RNA interactions mediated by TRS-L, we applied a
viewpoint analysis [28] to 5'-3' and 3'-5' chimeras. We found multiple TRS-L
interaction peaks along the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and these peaks were adjacent to
the 5’-end of canonical sgRNA regions (Figure 2A, 2B and 2D) and particularly
obvious for 3’-5’ chimeras. By contrast, there were few 3’-5’ chimeras in
non-ligated samples or RNA-seq data (Figure S3A). To rule out the possibility that
these 3’-5’ chimeras come from sgRNAs, we analyzed the distribution of junction

sites of TRS-L, and found that these sites were highly variable (Figure 2C).
Furthermore, the varied mapped positions of both arms of chimeric reads spanning
junction sites, as shown in Figure 2E and S3D for examples, further supported the
origin of chimeras from genome folding rather than sgRNA transcripts. Therefore,
simplified SPLASH data contains both TRS-L mediated RNA-RNA interactions and
TRS-L dependent sgRNAs, which can be discriminated by our methods. RNA base
pairing mediated by long range interaction indicated that TRS-L may stably associate
with TRS-B regions (Figure 2F and Figure S4). Interestingly, we noticed that TRS-L
usually does not interact with the exact TRS-B sequence, but with a flanking
sequence within 50nt away. This might provide flexibility for the next step of paring
to Ccs-B and template switching.

Identification and validation of novel TRS-L dependent sgRNAs
Apart from canonical sgRNAs, we also observed additional regions interacting with
TRS-L (black arrowhead indicated in Figure 2A), with one of them (3.9K) also
identified in Ziv’s recent report [27]. The contact matrix based on 3’-5’ chimeric
reads and an analysis of individual chimeras showed specific interactions (Figure S5).
These regions form stable base pairing with the TRS-L region (Figure S5C and S5E).
To check if the TRS-L mediated interactions give rise to new candidate sgRNAs, we
performed RT-PCR in independent non-crosslinked cells. Sanger sequencing results
confirmed these sgRNAs indeed exist (Figure S5F and S5G). Interestingly, although
these novel sgRNA have no canonical ACGAAC core sequence motif (CS-B), they
both partially overlap with the canonical CS motif. This indicates that TRS-L and
partial cCS-B base pairing at negative strand are critical for template switching in
discontinuous transcription of these sgRNAs.
It should be interesting to further validate expression and function of the novel
transcripts in the future. This analysis also emphasizes the value of our experiment in
dissecting interaction and discontinuous transcription of coronaviruses.

Alternative structure around frame shift elements.
A characteristic feature of coronaviruses is the programmed -1 ribosomal
frameshifting to facilitate translation of ORF1b encoding RdRp and controls the
relative expression of their proteins. Next, we sought to analyze both local and long
range interactions around FSE.
In our data, the proposed three-stem pseudoknot structure [11] was supported by
chimeric reads (Figure 3A and 3B), while at the same time, we also found alternative
local structures embedding the FSE in larger stable stem loops (arch1), which are all
supported by chimeras (Figure 3B, alternative structures 1 and 2). Surprisingly, we
also found several alternative long range interactions mediated by FSE (Figure 3A).
Besides FSE-arch identified by Ziv et al (referred to as Ziv’s arch hereafter), the
alternative arches are formed by FSE and upstream ~620 nt (arch 2) and ~1.1 kb (arch
3) elements respectively (Figure 3A). These elements form stable base pairing with
FSE (Figure 3B and 3C). 3D structure modeling of the FSE around region (12K-15K)
also revealed the spatial proximity between arch 2 and Ziv’s arch (Figure 3D).

Dynamics of RNA structure during viral life cycle of SARS-CoV-2
Next, we analyzed interaction dynamics during phases of viral life cycle. A
correlation analysis showed that samples from the same treatment group clustered
together (Figure S6A). PCA analysis on chimeric read counts indicates that virion
RNA underwent major conformation alteration compared to RNAs in cell (C) and in
lysate (L), as shown along primary component (PC) 1 (Figure S6B).
We then used DESeq2 [28, 32] to analyze interactions in each 100 nt × 100 nt
window in the viral interaction map. After removal of the low-abundant pairs,
pairwise comparisons between C, L and V groups were made. Under a default cutoff

， FDR < 0.05), we found similar patterns of differential interactions in

(log2FC > ±1

the comparisons of virions vs cell (VvsC) and virion vs lysate (VvsL) (Figure S7A),
and fold changes of VvsC are correlated with both VvsL and LvsC (Figure S7B). This
is concordant with the close relationship between C and L groups in PCA (Figure

S6B), suggesting the RNA conformation changes gradually from C to L and then to
V.
A heatmap analysis of differential interactions (Figure 4A) suggested a lower density
of interactions in the 3’-third of SARS-CoV-2 genome in virions, compared to cells
and lysates. Genome cyclization [28] was also reduced in virions, while proximal
interactions and long range interactions other than end-to-end cyclization were
strengthened in virions (Figure 4A). An increase in proximal and long-range
interactions could also be observed in lysate and still visible when log2FC cutoff was
elevated to 5 (Figure S7C). This indicated compaction of genome during packaging
into virions.
We then focused on the changes in interaction mediated by TRS-L region (first 100nt).
These interactions were weakened in virions, compared to cells or lysates, both for
TRS-L-sgRNA long range interaction and local folding at the 5’-end of ORF1ab.
However, the TRS-L-S interaction was stronger in the lysate than in cells (Figure
S7D), perhaps reflecting the first steps of packaging of the viral genome.
The distributions of differential loop lengths are different between cells, lysates and
virions (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p<2e-16) (Figure 4B). This prompted us to check
if these differential interactions are mediated by different kinds of RNAs. RNA-seq
coverage in the 3’ third of the genome, where canonical sgRNAs are located, is
significantly higher than in the 5’-two thirds [3]. Therefore, for simplicity, we
considered interactions involving fragments 3’ from nt 21,562 to be mediated by
sgRNA, and interactions 5’ from nt 21,562 to be mediated by gRNA. We found that
most interactions enriched in virions compared to cells or lysates are mediated by
gRNA, while interactions depleted in virions are typically mediated by sgRNAs
(Figure S7E). In particular, for the differential interactions with long (1kb - 20kb)
loops, the weakened interactions are almost always mediated by sgRNAs (Figure
S7F). This phenomenon can also be observed in L group compared to C group,
indicating that changes in RNA interaction and conformation occur gradually during
the virus packaging process. The depletion of interactions mediated by sgRNAs might
reflect a decrease in abundance of these sgRNAs. Disruption of long range interaction
was also observed for Zika virus inside cells [33], here in SARS-CoV-2, we

demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs undergoes genome compacting and
decreasing in sgRNAs when packaging into virions.
The simplified SPLASH data heatmaps are similar to mammalian genome Hi-C data
[34] (Figure 4F), and previous studies suggested that the Zika virus genome is
compartmentalized into boundary-demarcated domains [35]. This prompted us to
check if SARS-CoV-2 genome RNA are also compartmentalized into domains, and
whether global compaction of genome RNA results in impairment of domains. To this
end, we applied an insulation score algorithm to call domain boundaries in
SARS-CoV-2 genome [36]. In this way, SARS-CoV-2 genome was split into 76, 71
and 96 domains in C, L and V samples, respectively. The average intra-domain
contact matrices were shown as heatmap in Figure 4C, indicating a reduction of
inter-domain interactions. As expected the insulation scores are significantly lower in
boundaries (Figure 4D). Remarkably, the insulation scores are highly correlated
between groups of samples (Fig S8A), and domain boundaries are consistent in
different samples (Figure 4F). Concordantly, the domain length was comparable
between samples (Fig S8 B).
Furthermore, the boundary strength in V are significantly higher than in C and L
samples (Figure 4E), and ratio of intra-domain to inter-domain interactions was also
higher in V samples (Figure S7C), indicating that during compaction and packaging
of the genome, the domain structures were not only retained but even strengthened.
Previous studies have revealed domains in Zika virus genome RNA [35] and
compaction in virions [33]. Here we described that domains in SARS-COV-2 are
stably maintained during life cycle.
Finally, we calculated Shannon entropy values along the SARS-CoV-2 genome
(Figure S9A). High entropy indicates flexible regions that may form multiple
alternative base-pairs [28]. As expected, the entropies are higher in virions than in
cells, indicating that RNAs in cells adopt more alternative structures than in virions
(Figure S9B). The entropies inversely correlate with insulation score (Figure S9C),
indicating that domain boundaries are more flexible, and might be more attractive
sites for drug design.

Discussion
In this study, we developed a simplified SPLASH protocol based on proximity
ligation to capture RNA-RNA interactions in the SARS-CoV-2 virus. RNA proximity
ligation has previously been used to address many questions in models ranging from
viruses to animal tissues [17, 19, 29, 30, 35, 37-39]. Whereas most previous methods
included steps to enrich cross-linked or ligated RNA duplexes, considering low input
of RNA amount in virions, we decided to omit all the enrichment steps and hence
reduce the complexity of the whole protocol to increase the RNA yield adequate for
lib construction and with high depth sequencing. Also, we used RNaseIII to fragment
RNA, this made all the treated RNA suitable for RNA ligation, and is supposed to
increase efficiency of ligation. As a result, we obtained 28.9% chimeric reads in
virions, and more than 10% chimeras in cells and lysates. The higher chimeric rates in
virions might result from highly compact genome.

Our results provide the first direct evidence that TRS-L regions form long-distance
interactions with TRS-B regions. Although it was widely believed that long range
interactions are required for discontinuous transcription, direct experimental evidence
for such interactions was lacking. By comparing TRS-L: TRS-B chimeras ligated in
3’-5’ and 5’-3’ orientations, we distinguished two classes of reads, which
represented (1) RNA-RNA interactions, and (2) sgRNAs. We validated two of the
putative sgRNAs by Sanger sequencing. Interestingly, although these novel sgRNAs

’

don t have canonical cCS-B motif upstream of gene body, they both partially overlap
with the canonical CS motif. This indicates that TRS-L and at least partial cCS-B base
pairing at negative strand are critical for template switching in discontinuous
transcription of these sgRNAs. It would be interesting to further identify novel TRS-L
dependent sgRNAs and check if they play roles in SARS-CoV-2 biology.
The FSE structure has attracted attention because it is of vital importance in
translating nonstructural proteins in ORF1B, and perturbing FSE have significance in
modulating coronavirus [40]. A three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot in the SARS
coronavirus frameshift signal was proposed [10] to regulate this process, and was
confirmed in SARS-CoV-2 [11]. However, in other cases, distinct structures other

than the three-stem pseudoknot were reported [14, 15]. Ziv et al found that the FSE of
SARS-CoV-2 is embedded within a ~1.5 kb long higher-order structure that bridges
the 3 end of ORF1a with the 5 region of ORF1b, which was termed the FSE-arch
′

′

[27]. Here we speculate that Ziv’s arch coexists with alternative structures, suggesting
that regions around FSE are dynamic, and that RNA conformation changes,
presumably to fine tune frameshifting rates and stoichiometry of nonstructural
proteins. These additional structures cooperate with Ziv’s arch to embed the FSE in a
larger “high order pseudoknot”. The large and small form of pseudoknot might
provide a structural basis for ribosome stalling. The mechanisms balancing alternative
structures and transcription and translation of orf1a/b remain to be elucidated in the
future. Interestingly, the alternative structures described above are also found in
virions (Figure 3A), suggesting that even packed into particles, the complicated
conformations remained.

By comparing dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 during its life cycle, we found
comprehensive compaction of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in virions compared to cells
(Figure 4), while genome cyclization and sgRNA-mediated interactions are reduced in
virions, and specific TRS-L: S interactions are stronger in virions and in late infected
cells (Figure S7D). We found that the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is demarcated by
domains, with intra-domain interactions stronger than inter-domain interactions. The
uniform and regular domain folding is reminiscent of the nucleosomes-like beaded
structure of eukaryotic genome. Importantly, we also found that domains are stronger
in virions, and positions of domain boundaries remained consistent during life cycle,
with a few domains merged in cells (Figure 4F). Domains were previously reported in
the Zika virus [35]. We therefore speculate that domain organization is the rule rather
than an exception of genome folding in single strand RNA viruses. Since boundaries
remain stable in different phases of virus life cycle, we hypothesize that nucleocapsid
(N) protein, packaging RNAs in particle, maintains its role as the regulator of the
genome structure in infected cells, when the RNA is released.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
Chlorocebus sabaeus (Green monkey) VeroE6 (female, RRID:CVCL_YQ49) were
purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, id: ATCC CRL-1586).

’

Vero E6 and VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco s modified Eagles
medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a
humidified CO2 incubator.

Virus inoculation and crosslinking
Infection experiments were performed under biosafety level 3 conditions.
SARS-CoV-2 virus strain Wuhan-Hu-1 was kindly provided by (Wuhan institute of
viology). Independent biological replicates were performed using 90-120 million cells
each. VeroE6 cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 strain Wuhan-Hu-1 at
MOI=0.01 pfu/cell for 24 hours. Following inoculation, two flasks of cells were
washed 3 times by PBS and then subjected to crosslinking. The remaining cells were
cultured for another 48hours, when cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in about 70%
cells, supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 4℃ 1000rpm for 10min to remove
cell pellet. Then the clear supernatant was mixed with equal volume of saturated
ammonium sulfate and incubate at 4℃ for one hour. At the same time, remaining
unshed cells were washed 3 times by PBS and subjected to crosslinking.

For crosslinking, cells or virus pellet were incubated with 2 mM of EZ-Link
Psoralen-PEG3- Biotin (ThermoFisher Scientific) at 37℃ for 10 min in PBS
containing 0.01% digitonin. The cells were then spread onto a 10cm plate and
irradiated using 365 nm UV for 20 min on ice. Cell and virion RNA were extracted
with RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen).

simplified SPLASH assay
500 ng of RNA was fragmented using RNase III (Ambion) in 20 l mixture for
μ

10miniutes at 37℃, and purified using 40 l of MagicPure RNA Beads (TransGen).
μ

Each RNA sample was divided in two: one half was used for proximity ligation and
then crosslink reversal (C, L and V samples), while in the other half, crosslink
reversal was done before proximity ligation (non-ligated C_N, L_N, V_N). Proximity
ligation was done under the following conditions: 200ng fragmented RNA, 1 unit/ l

RNA ligase 1 (New England Biolabs), 1× RNA ligase buffer, 50 mM ATP, 1 unit/ l
μ

Superase-in (Invitrogen), final volume: 200 l. Reactions were incubated for 16 hours
μ

at 16 °C and were terminated by cleaning with miRNeay kit (Qiagen). Crosslink
reversal was done by irradiating the RNA on ice 254 nm UVC for 5min using a
CL-1000 crosslinker (UVP).

Sequencing library preparation
Sequencing libraries were prepared with 50ng input RNA material using SMARTer
Stranded Total RNA-seq Kit v2—Pico Input Mammalian (Takara Bio USA Inc.,

’

USA), according to the manufacturer s instructions. The libraries were paired-end
sequenced (PE150) using Illumina Nova seq platform.

Data pre-processing
Data preprocessing was performed according to (Ziv et al., 2018). In brief, raw
paired-end reads were trimmed for adaptors and checked for quality using cutadapt
(Martin, 2011). Chimeric reads were identified and annotated to the respective

genome using hyb (Travis et al., 2014). SARS-CoV2 samples were processed using
SARS-CoV-2 sequence (NC_045512.2).

Chimeras and interaction calling
Chimeric reads were called and annotated with the hyb package [41], using the
command:
default (stringent) parameters:
hyb

analyse

in=sample_R2.fq

db=SARS-CoV-2_no_polyA

Relaxed pipeline:

in=

sample_R2.fq

To evaluate the folding energy of chimeric reads, we used hybrid-min28 with default
settings. We then randomly reassigned (shuffled) pairs of fragments found in chimeric
reads, and repeated the folding energy analysis. The folding energies of
experimentally identified and shuffled chimeras were compared by Wilcoxon test.
Virus interaction heatmaps were plotted using Java Treeview [42], as previously
described [28], such that color intensity represents the coverage of chimeric reads at
every pair of positions. The first read of each pair is plotted along the X axis, and the
second read along the Y axis. As a result, chimeras found in the 5'-3' orientation are
shown above the diagonal, and chimeras in the 3'-5' orientation are below the diagonal.
Viewpoint histograms and arc plots were plotted with ggplot2 R package [43].
For TRS-L interaction peak calling, each chimeric read was split and mapped to two
paired non-overlapping 10nt- bins, we first scored interactions by log2 transformed
chimeric reads, then calculated z-scores for all the interaction pairs. z-scores > 2.13
(which means log2 chimeras larger than average with 95% confidential) were
considered as enriched interactions. Then enriched TRS-L interaction were selected if
either arm located in 1-100nt.

RNA secondary structure folding
For short range interactions, we assembled non-zero chimeric groups into
uninterrupted stem structures, and then fold RNA using COMRADES (https://
github.com/gkudla/comrades).
For long range interactions, we first assembled uninterrupted stem structures as above
for each arm, and then fold RNA by hybrid-min in unafold-3.8 [44].
Folded structures were visualized in VARNAv3-93.

Calling of Topological Domain
Domain boundaries were identified by insulation score [36] using the 10 nt resolution
simplified SPLASH contact matrices data. Here we used 500 nt×500 nt (50×
resolution) square along each bin for calculating insulation score, A 150 nt (10×
resolution) window was used for statistics of the delta vector and removed the weak
boundaries which ‘boundary strength’ lower than 1.

Average Insulation Score of Domain
The average insulation scores were normalized by around all domain as well as their
nearby regions (± 0.5 domain length). The heatmaps were binned at 10 nt resolution
and an 800 nt window. Average insulation scores were plotted around boundaries
from 1/2 domain upstream to 1/2 domain downstream.

Average interaction heatmap of domains.
The size of the domain was homogenized to 400 nt, the upstream and downstream
extended 1 / 2 domain. calculated the interaction frequency by the averaging all
domain. The resulted matrices were plotted as heatmap by log2 average signals.

3D modeling of virus genome
We used pastis-0.1.0[45] software to model RNA genome in three dimensions. The
final results obtained by MDS algorithm were used for 3D visualization. For the
spatial location of particular gene loci, we used 1 point/20 balls to calculate the
position of specific genes in the whole 3D simulation, and then modify the pymol
results by a python script.

Differential interaction identifying
Differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 [32]. 100nt-Bin
interactions that displayed more than ±1 log2FC (FDR <0.01) between C or L and V
samples were considered as significantly differential interactions. Then log2FC
heatmaps were plotted in using Java Treeview.

RT-PCR of candidate novel sgRNAs
RNA from infected non-crosslinked VERO celles (24hours, as described above) were
extracted by miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). 100ng of RNA was then subjected to
retrotranscription using SuperScript VILO Master Mix (Thermo Fisher), cDNA was
amplified with 2xEs Taq MasterMix (Cowin Biotech) by 0.4 M of each primer: 3.9K

Statistics
Statistical analyses for differential interaction was conducted with the R Bioconductor
package DESeq2 using three independent replicates as described above.
Comparing quantitative indicators such as boundaries strength, was performed with
two-sided Wilcox rank sum test.
To test whether differential interactions spannings follow the same continuous
distribution, two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed.
Statistical significance of differences in odds ratios between two groups (Figure S6E,
S6F) was calculated using a two-sided Fisher’s exact test.
Correlation analysis of chimeric reads counts (Figure 1B, S1) and insulation scores
(Figure S7A) between samples were performed by Pearson's product moment
correlation coefficient (R or PCC).
All the statistics tests were performed with R package stats.
