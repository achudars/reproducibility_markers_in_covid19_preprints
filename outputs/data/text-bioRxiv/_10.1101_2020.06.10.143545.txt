Abstract

48

The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV)-2

49

(SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease (covid19) has posed a great threat to human

50

health. Previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-

51

CoV) from the same CoV family had posed similar threat to human health and economic

52

growth. To date, not even a single drug specific to any of these CoVs has been developed nor

53

any anti-viral vaccine is available for the treatment of diseases caused by CoVs. Subunits

54

present in spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are involved in binding to

55

human ACE2 Receptor which is the primary method of viral invasion. As it has been observed

56

in the previous studies that there are very minor differences in the spike glycoproteins of

57

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 has an additional furin cleavage site that makes it

58

different from SARS-CoV (Walls et al., 2020). In this study, we have analyzed spike

59

glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV phylogenetically and subjected them to selection

60

pressure analysis. Selection pressure analysis has revealed some important sites in SARS-

61

CoV-2 and SARS-CoV spike glycoproteins that might be involved in their pathogenicity.

62

Further, we have developed a potential multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-

63

2 by analyzing its interactions with HLA-B*15:03 subtype. This vaccine consists of multiple

64

T-helper (TH) cells, B-cells, and Cytotoxic T-cells (CTL) epitopes joined by linkers and an

65

adjuvant to increase its immunogenicity. Conservation of selected epitopes in SARS, MERS,

66

and human hosts, suggests that the designed vaccine could provide cross-protection. The

67

vaccine is designed in silico by following a reverse vaccinology method acknowledging its

68

antigenicity, immunogenicity, toxicity, and allergenicity. The vaccine candidate that we have

Introduction

75

Coronavirus (CoV) is a pathogen that affects the human respiratory system. Previous

76

severe outbreaks of CoVs have been emerged posing a great threat to public health. These

77

outbreaks include Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East

78

Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). Recently, in December 2019, a new type of

79

coronavirus has emerged called SARS-CoV-2 or novel CoV-2019 (nCoV-2019) from Hubei

80

province in China (Zhu et al., 2020). Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has posed a great threat to public

81

health through coronavirus disease (covid19) (Pedersen & Ho, 2020; Velavan & Meyer,

82

2020). Due to the lack of proper antiviral treatment and vaccination, covid19 is spreading

83

person to person at a very fast rate without being an air-borne disease (Jin et al., 2020;

84

Rothan & Byrareddy, 2020).

85

There is no proper treatment available for covid19 except a few FDA approved drugs

86

including Remdesivir (Agostini et al., 2018), Favipirar (“Favipiravir shows good clinical

87

efficacy in treating COVID-19: official - Xinhua | English.news.cn,” 2020), Hydrochloroquine

88

with Azithromycin (Gautret et al., 2020) have shown some excellent results on covid19

89

patients (Jean, Lee, & Hsueh, 2020). However, there is no such drug designed for the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.10.143545; this version posted June 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

90

treatment of covid19 yet. Continuing outbreaks of CoVs pose a great threat to human health

91

and still, there are no licensed vaccines for gaining protection against these CoVs are

92

available yet. However, there have been some attempts to develop a few vaccines for SARS-

93

CoV-2 including monoclonal antibody therapy (Shanmugaraj, Siriwattananon, Wangkanont,

94

& Phoolcharoen, 2020) and a possible mRNA-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (F. Wang, Kream, &

95

Stefano, 2020). That calls for a desperate need for an anti-viral treatment and vaccine for

96

SARS-CoV-2.

97

In this work, we have studied spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 as they have a furin

98

cleavage site which is conserved amongst the 144 SARS-CoV-2 isolates (Zhou et al., 2020).

99

This cleavage site located at the boundary of S1/S2 subunits differentiates SARS-CoV-2 from

100

SARS-CoV and other related CoVs (Walls et al., 2020). Therefore, we have analyzed spike

101

glycoproteins phylogenetically, subjected them to selection pressure analysis, and predicted

102

epitopes for vaccine development. We have designed an in silico novel multi-epitope

103

potential vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. The potential epitopes were predicted from spike

104

glycoprotein sequences. These epitopes showing immunogenicity and antigenicity were

105

selected. They were further filtered using molecular docking with HLA-B*15:03 allele as it

106

has been reported to be responsive in inducing an immunogenic response effectively against

107

SARS-CoV-2 (A. Nguyen et al., 2020). The interaction of constructed multi-epitope vaccine

108

with HLA-B*15:03 allele was analyzed using molecular docking and showed various high-

109

affinity bonds. Furthermore, the immune response of the candidate vaccine was simulated

110

in silico and showed a significant immune response.

Results

112

Phylogenetic analysis

113

The constructed ML tree is shown in Figure 1. The phylogenetic tree of spike

114

glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 showed distinct clades of these protein groups.

115

However, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in spike glycoprotein sequences

116

(gi_1824676380_pdb_6W41_C and gi_1822249606_pdb_6M0J_E) of SARS-CoV-2 show

117

larger branch lengths than the other sequences of the same. The low scoring sequences were

118

eliminated from the rest of the sequences based on the phylogenetic tree. This resulted in a

119

set of relevant spike glycoprotein sequences which were further subjected to selection

120

analysis followed by antigenic sequence identification and in silico vaccine design.

121

Selection pressure analysis

122

Spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 show positive selection

123

The selection pressure analysis of spike glycoprotein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 showed

124

positive selection on a few sites. However, no single site has been identified which has

125

experienced negative selection. Besides, BUSTED found no evidence of gene-wide episodic

126

diversifying/positive selection. Three positively selected sites were identified by MEME at a

127

p-value threshold of 0.05 and four such sites were identified by FUBAR (two sites coinciding

128

with MEME) with a posterior probability of 0.9 (Additional file 1). Out of these four unique

129

identified sites, two sites were found to be potentially relevant. These two sites, Cys538 and

130

Thr549, were mapped on the structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (PDB ID: 6VXX)

131

(Figure 2). As evident from the results shown in Figure 2, these sites were found to be

132

present on β-sheets. The intermolecular interactions among β-sheets in a folded structure

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.10.143545; this version posted June 14, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

133

are considered important and have long been recognized (Nowick, 2008). They are involved

134

in protein-protein interaction, protein quaternary structure, and protein aggregation. β-

135

sheet interactions in some biological processes have been considered as potential targets for

136

the treatment of diseases including cancer (J. Wang, Li, & Jasti, 2018) and AIDS (Li et al.,

137

2013). Therefore, the two sites identified as positively selected sites may be relevant in spike

138

glycoprotein structure stability and formation.

139

Spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV show positive selection

140

The selection pressure analysis of spike glycoprotein sequences of SARS-CoV showed

141

positive selection on a larger number of sites as compared to that of SARS-CoV-2. However,

142

like SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins, no single site has been identified which has

143

experienced negative selection. Unlike, SARS-CoV-2, BUSTED found evidence of gene-wide

144

episodic diversifying selection at a p-value <=0.05 with synonymous rate variation. FUBAR

145

has identified 2 sites of episodic positive selection with a posterior probability of 0.9 and

146

MEME has identified 9 such sites at a p-value threshold of 0.05 (Additional file 2). These

147

identified sites under positive selection were mapped on the crystal structure of spike

148

glycoprotein of SARS-CoV (PDB ID: 5X58) to recognize their relevance. The well-studied

149

structure of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein (Walls et al., 2020) helped to locate the positively

150

selected sites in different regions of the structure. The mapping revealed that a site Thr244

151

lies in N-terminal domain (NTD), Val594 and Ala609 lie in Subdomain2 (SD2), Thr743 and

152

Pro794 lie in Linker (L) and upstream helix (UH) region, Leu803 lies in Fusion peptide (FP)

153

region, and Leu1031 lies in the central helix (CH), β-hairpin (BH), and Subdomain3 (SD3)

154

region of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein (Figure 3).

In silico design of multi-epitope vaccine
A complete scheme of in silico vaccine design is shown in Figure 4 and explained in the
following sections.

158

Antigenic sequences from SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins

159

15 antigenic high scoring (threshold >0.5) sequences were obtained out of 23 sequences

160

of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein submitted to the VaxiJen server. These selected sequences

161

were used to identify T-cell, B-cell, and CTL epitopes.

162

Epitopes prediction from antigenic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins

163

The total number of T-cell, B-cell, and CTL predicted epitopes were 94, 89, and 47

164

respectively. The predicted epitopes were further analyzed for their immunogenicity. This

165

provided 24, 15, and 7 T-cell, B-cell, and CTL epitopes with potential immunogenicity

166

respectively. These epitope sequences were further subjected to toxicity analysis. All these

167

resultant sequences showed non-toxic behavior and were subjected to further analyses.

168

Structure prediction of HLA-B*15:03 subtype

169

Swissmodel provides a quality estimation of predicted models using GMQE (Studer et

170

al., 2020) and QMEAN score (Benkert, Biasini, & Schwede, 2011). GMQE (Global Model

171

Quality Estimation) ranges between 0 and 1, a higher number implies higher reliability.

172

QMEAN Z-score provides an estimate of experimental structures having a similar size.

173

Positive values of QMEAN around zero indicate models with high quality. The HLA-B*15:03

174

subtype of HLA-B*15 allele with GMQE score of 0.78 and QMEAN of 0.81 (Figure 5A). Both

175

the values indicate the predicted structure of the HLA-B*15:03 subtype is of high quality. The

176

predicted structure was validated by plotting the Ramachandran plot. The plot showed

177

94.2% residues in most favored regions, 5% in additionally allowed regions, 0.8% in

178

generously allowed regions, and 0% in disallowed regions (Figure 5B). This structure was

179

used for molecular docking of the selected epitopes possessing potential immunogenicity.

180

Screening of potential epitopes for multi-epitope vaccine development

181

The selected epitope sequences were docked with HLA-B*15:03 subtype. The top five

182

epitopes showing the lowest binding affinity were selected for further analyses. The binding

183

affinities of the selected potential epitopes are shown in Table 1 along with their homology

184

searched for MERS, SARS, and human host. According to the obtained docking results, these

185

epitopes bound to the receptor effectively. This method was performed for each type of

186

epitope (T-cell, B-cell, and CTL epitopes).

187

In silico design of multi-epitope vaccine

188

The designed multi-epitope vaccine consisted of 699 amino acid residues including

189

linkers, adjuvant, and a 6x-His tag added at the C-terminus for purification purposes (Figure

190

6). This potential vaccine is non-allergen. Molecular weight is 75143.19, theoretical pI is

191

5.36, the Grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) is 0.016, the aliphatic index is 90.89, and

192

instability index is 35.14 classifying potential vaccine as stable. Predicted secondary

193

structure of the multi-epitope vaccine candidate consists of 34% alpha-helices, 28% beta-

194

sheets, and 36% coils (Figure 7). The predicted solubility of the multi-epitope vaccine was a

195

little below average value (0.45) (Figure 8). It implies that the multi-epitope is less soluble

196

in E. coli protein.

197

I-Tasser predicted five models, out of which model 1 was selected having a C-score of -

198

2.03 (Figure 9A). The predicted structure was validated by plotting the Ramachandran plot.

199

The plot showed 69% residues in most favored regions, 25.2% residues in additionally

200

allowed regions, 3.6% residues in generously allowed regions, and 2.1% residues in

201

disallowed regions (Figure 9B).

202

multi-epitope vaccine binds effectively with HLA-B*15:03

203

The top-ranking pose was selected from HADDOCK showing Z-score of -1.9, the most

204

negative value amongst all poses (Z-score more negative is better). Docked complex of multi-

205

epitope vaccine candidate and HLA-B*15:03 subtype was analyzed using the PRODIGY

206

server and later by Pymol. The binding affinity was found to be -13.5 kcal/mol and

207

dissociation constant (Kd) was 1.2E-10 M at 25˚C. A Pymol script generated by PRODIGY

208

helped to visualize the interacting residues between the multi-epitope vaccine candidate and

209

the predicted HLA-B*15:03 subtype structure (Figure 10A). The number of contacts made at

210

the interface (ICs) per property include charged-charged: 3, charged-polar: 3, charged-

211

apolar: 41, polar-polar: 5, polar-apolar: 25, and apolar-apolar: 24. A list of all interacting

212

residues is provided in Table 2. Amongst them, the closely interacting residues include Ile90,

213

Lys92, Glu100, Ser155, Ala174, Gln179, Arg181, and Arg194 (Figure 10B). The molecular

214

docking of candidate multi-epitope vaccine with HLA-B*15:03 suggests that this designed

215

vaccine may be a good candidate against covid19.

217

In silico Immune simulation of multi-epitope vaccine shows a significant immune
response

218

T helper cells (CD4):

219

After day 0, total TH cells (CD4) were noticed to increase from 1300 to reach a maximum

220

of 6000 then rise again after the second injection at day21 to reach 10000 on day 27. In the

221

meantime, TH memory cells level increased until it reached 4000 on day 21 then jumped to

222

reach 9000 cells and fell gradually (Figure 11A). Most of these cells were in an active state

223

reaching a level of 3000 on day21 then increased again to 5000 cells on day 30 after

224

vaccination while few of them became tolerant anergic in the first week (Figure 11B). Active

225

regulatory TH cells started to rise from 20 at the beginning of vaccination to a level of 160

226

after 2 days then fell gradually (Figure 11C). TH1 (shown in plot as Th1) level increased to

227

reach a level of 50000 at day 21 then kept rising to reach 90000 cells by the day 27 (Figure

228

11D) showing 100% till the end of the third month (Figure 11E) while the T regulatory (TR)

229

cells did not exceed the number of 160 cells.

230

CTL (CD8):

231

Non-memory CTL (CD8) can be seen increasing from below 1100 after day 0 to reach a

232

maximum level of 1130 number of cells on day 23, then falling again only to rise at day 27 (6

233

days after the second injection) (Figure 12 A). Meanwhile, CTL memory cells continued to

234

rise until they reached to a number of 1130 cells. CTL active cells were predicted to increase

235

after day 0 to reach a level of 900 at day 40 before it started to fall. Tolerant anergic cells did

236

not exceed the level of 600 throughout the simulation (Figure 12B). Dendritic cells (DC) can

237

either present antigen to MHC1 or MHC2. Here, around 200 DCs are presenting antigens to

238

MHC2 in comparison to only 10 DC cells presenting to MHC1 (Figure 12C).

239

B-cells and antibodies

240

The total B-cell number increased from 0 on day 1 to near 700 on day 21 before slowly

241

falling again (Figure 13A). Moreover, antibodies production was noticed to occur almost five

242

days after the beginning of infection with an earlier rise in Immunoglobulin-M (IgM)

243

followed by the rise of Immunoglobulin-G (IgG). Both were noticed to fall until day 20, before

244

rising again after the second injection at day 21 (Figure 13B).

245

Cytokines, Interleukins, and Natural killer (NK) cells:

246

Cytokines are necessary for successful vaccination. Here, for our designed vaccine

247

candidate, all cytokines started to increase after day 0 to reach a maximum level at day 5 and

248

7, then started to fall, only to rise again after the second vaccine injection at day 21 to reach

249

similar levels except for Interferon-ɣ (IFN-ɣ) whose subsequent rise is only up to 1250 in

250

comparison to 420000 in the first injection reaction. Special focus was on the response of

251

Interleukin-2 (IL-2), where a higher level (450000) of IL-2 was noticed after the second

252

injection (Figure 14A).

253

NK cells are an integral part of the early response to the virus. The in silico simulation of

254

vaccine candidate showed high fluctuations in the population of NK cells throughout the 90

255

days beginning from a level of 345 cells then fluctuated to reach a level around 330 by the

256

end of third month (Figure 14B).

Conclusion

258

In this study, we have studied spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

259

phylogenetically and designed a multi-epitope vaccine for covid19. The selection pressure

260

analysis on spike glycoproteins revealed several important sites that have undergone

261

positive selection. Interestingly, no negative selection was found in both types of CoVs. As

262

negative selection selectively removes the harmful variants, it indicates that the selection

263

process in SARS-CoVs has not been stabilized yet. Additionally, it also suggests that the

264

negative selection in SARS-CoVs is quite weak that is allowing the widespread of deleterious

265

mutations in the genome. This can eventually lead to the back mutations which may

266

potentially act as one of the contributing factor in maintaining the genomic integrity of the

267

virus (Loewe, 2008). Besides, unlike SARS-CoV, the gene-wide episodic diversifying selection

268

was not found in SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins.

269

A proper methodology was followed during the in silico designing of a multi-epitope

270

vaccine candidate. The potential epitopes were screened using molecular docking and were

271

selected based on the lowest binding affinity. The vaccine was constructed using these

272

epitopes only for better binding results. This vaccine candidate shows effective binding with

273

the HLA-B*15:03 subtype that is effective in eliciting an immune response against SARS-CoV-

274

2. The in silico immune simulation of the designed vaccine showed a significant rise in TH

275

cells after the first injection and reached its maximum level after the second injection

276

accompanied by the formation of TH memory cells. Further, the total number of CTL and DCs

277

increased over three months. IgM levels reached a high value after the second injection

278

followed by a rise in IgG levels. Furthermore, IL-2 reached its maximum value at day 7 and

279

then attained even higher levels after the second injection. These results show that the

280

designed multi-epitope vaccine candidate is capable of inducing a humoral immune response

281

against covid19. However, it still requires the experimental results and clinical trials to be

282

more assured about the same. Additionally, this designed vaccine candidate could be

283

beneficial in providing cross-protection against covid19 and the other similar viral diseases.

Methods

285

Phylogenetic analysis

286

Protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein were retrieved from NCBI

287

(www.ncbi.nih.nlm.gov) (Table 3). A phylogenetic tree of spike glycoprotein sequences of

288

SARS-CoV-2 was constructed using IQTREE (L. T. Nguyen, Schmidt, Von Haeseler, & Minh,

289

2015). SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein sequences were used as the outgroup and were

290

downloaded from NCBI (www.ncbi.nih.nlm.gov). The best model used was VT+G4, namely,

291

the ‘Variable Time’ matrix (Müller & Vingron, 2001) with Gamma distribution (under four

292

rate categories) as predicted by ModelFinder (Kalyaanamoorthy, Minh, Wong, Von Haeseler,

293

& Jermiin, 2017). Some of the outliner (low scoring) sequences were removed according to

294

the phylogenetic tree.

295

Selection Analysis

296

The evolutionary analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein sequences and GISAID

297

sequences was carried out at the Datamonkey server (https://www.datamonkey.org) of

298

HYPHY program (Pond & Muse, 2005). BUSTED (Branch-site Unrestricted Statistical Test for

299

Episodic Diversification) (Murrell et al., 2015), FUBAR (Fast Unconstrained Bayesian

300

Approximation) (Murrell et al., 2013) and MEME (Mixed Effects Maximum Likelihood)

301

(Murrell et al., 2012) methods were used to detect episodic and pervasive selection pressure

302

at each site respectively.

In silico design of multi-epitope vaccine

304

Antigenic sequence identification

305

The antigenic sequences among the selected sequences were identified using the VaxiJen

306

server (http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.html). The threshold was

307

set to the default value of 0.5. VaxiJen predicts protective antigens with accuracy ranging

308

between 79% to 89% as tested on three different datasets (Doytchinova & Flower, 2007).

309

Epitope prediction and selection

310

B-cell epitopes were predicted using SVMTrip (Yao, Zhang, Liang, & Zhang, 2012). T-cell

311

epitopes were predicted using Tepitool (Paul, Sidney, Sette, & Peters, 2016) of IEDB (Vita et

312

al., 2019) with IC-50 value more than 500 nM for MHC-I and MHC-II. CTLs were predicted

313

using CTLPred (Bhasin & Raghava, 2004). The predicted epitopes were subjected to

314

immunogenicity analysis using IEDB (Vita et al., 2019). The predicted potential immunogens

315

were analyzed for toxicity using ToxinPred (Gupta et al., 2013).

316

Structure prediction and validation of HLA-B*15:03 subtype

317

Homology modeling was performed to obtain the structures of HLA-B*15:03 subtype

318

and selected epitopes using the Swissmodel (Waterhouse et al., 2018). The predicted

319

structures of HLA-B*15:03 was further validated by creating the Ramachandran Plot using

320

PROCHECK (Laskowski, MacArthur, Moss, & Thornton, 1993).

321

Selection of potential epitopes for multi-epitope vaccine

322

The selected epitopes with potential immunogenicity were docked with HLA-B*15:03

323

subtype to filter out epitopes. The docking was carried out using Autodock Vina (Trott &

324

Olson, 2009). Binding pocket and residues in HLA-B*15:03 were identified using the CASTp

325

3.0 server (Tian, Chen, Lei, Zhao, & Liang, 2018). The binding x, y, and z coordinates in

326

Autodock Vina were defined as 5.103, 13.862, and 146.304 respectively.

327

Construction of multi-epitope vaccine

328

Top 5 epitopes from each B-cell, T-cell, and CTL epitopes showing the lowest binding

329

affinities towards HLA-B*15:03 were selected from the bound epitopes. The finally selected

330

epitopes were joined together using GPGPG and AAY linkers. An adjuvant (Q0VDF9) was

331

added at the N-terminal of the multi-epitope vaccine using the EAAAK linker to increase its

332

immunogenicity. The adjuvant sequence was downloaded from the Uniprot database

333

(https://www.uniprot.org).

348

predicted tertiary structure of the multi-epitope vaccine was validated using PROCHECK

349

(Laskowski et al., 1993).

350

Physicochemical properties prediction of multi-epitope vaccine

351

The allergenicity of the designed vaccine candidate was predicted using Allertop v. 2.0

352

(http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/AllerTOP)

and

AllergenFP

v.

1.0

(http://ddg-

353

pharmfac.net/AllergenFP). Allertop predicts allergenicity by incorporating the auto cross-

354

variance (ACC) protein sequence mining method (Dimitrov, Bangov, Flower, & Doytchinova,

355

2014). AllergenFP calculates the Tanimoto coefficient to rate all protein pairs. Protein from

356

the pair with the highest Tanimoto coefficient is classified as allergen or non-allergen

357

(Dimitrov, Naneva, Doytchinova, & Bangov, 2014).

358

Physicochemical properties of designed candidate vaccine were predicted using

359

Protparam (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/) (Gasteiger et al., 2005). Properties

360

including theoretical PI, molecular weight, estimated half-life, instability index, and Grand

361

Average of Hydropathicity (GRAVY) were estimated.

362

Molecular Docking of multi-epitope vaccine with HLA-B*15:03 subtype

363

Active residues of the multi-epitope vaccine were identified using the CASTp server

364

(http://sts.bioe.uic.edu/castp/) (Tian et al., 2018). The multi-epitope vaccine was docked

365

with

values. Random Seed (12345) was used, simulation volume was set to 10, and simulation

397

steps were set to 270 (= 90 days) with two injections the first at the 1-time step which equals

398

the first eight hours of simulation, and the second injection at 63-time steps which is equal

399

to three weeks. The rest of the parameters were left with default values. No specific antigen
