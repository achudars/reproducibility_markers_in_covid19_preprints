SUMMARY
The Coronaviridae is a family of positive-strand RNA viruses that includes SARS-CoV-2,
the etiologic agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bearing the largest single-stranded RNA
genomes in nature, coronaviruses are critically dependent on long-distance RNA-RNA
interactions to regulate the viral transcription and replication pathways. Here we
experimentally mapped the in vivo RNA-RNA interactome of the full-length SARS-CoV-2
genome and subgenomic mRNAs. We uncovered a network of RNA-RNA interactions
spanning tens of thousands of nucleotides. These interactions reveal that the viral genome and
subgenomes adopt alternative topologies inside cells, and engage in different interactions
with host RNAs. Notably, we discovered a long-range RNA-RNA interaction - the FSE-arch
- that encircles the programmed ribosomal frameshifting element. The FSE-arch is conserved
in the related MERS-CoV and is under purifying selection. Our findings illuminate RNA
structure based mechanisms governing replication, discontinuous transcription, and
translation of coronaviruses, and will aid future efforts to develop antiviral strategies.

INTRODUCTION

RNA viruses comprise the dominant component of the eukaryotic virome (Dolja and Koonin,
2018). Their error-prone genome replication mode allows them to rapidly evolve new
variants and to jump from animals to humans (Woolhouse and Gaunt, 2007), thus presenting
a high epidemic and pandemic threat. Several members of the betacoronavirus genus (family
Coronaviridae), namely the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV),
the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as well as the Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are of special concern. SARSCoV-2, the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread to date to
nearly every country in the world, resulting in millions of infections, over a million of deaths,
and a massive global economic impact (McKibbin and Fernando, 2020). Even though
worldwide efforts and resources are redirected to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic, at
present, there are no approved vaccines or antiviral medicines. This illustrates the urgent
need for deciphering in-depth the molecular biology of coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV2.

Coronaviruses have evolved the largest known single-stranded RNA genome in nature.
Regulation of their mRNA transcription and translation is facilitated by cis-acting structures
that interact with each other, with viral proteins, and with host machineries (Madhugiri et al.,
2016). mRNA transcription in coronaviruses involves a process whereby so-called
subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNAs) are produced through discontinuous genomic RNA
(gRNA) template utilization, which is in contrast to replication of the full-length genome
(Sawicki et al., 2007). This discontinuous transcription is mediated by the Transcription
Regulating Sequence-leader (TRS-L) at the 5 end of the genome, and the Transcription
′

Regulating Sequence-body (TRS-B) at the 5 ends of each ORF. Template switching between

these RNA sequence elements results in a set of 5 and 3 co-terminal, “nested” sgmRNAs of

′

different sizes on which the 5 proximal ORFs are translated into nonstructural or structural

viral proteins (Moreno et al., 2008; Sola et al., 2015). The mechanisms underlying
discontinuous transcription and genome replication have not been fully worked out, however
long-distance RNA-RNA interactions along the viral genome have been proposed as key

regulators (Mateos-Gómez et al., 2011; Mateos-Gomez et al., 2013; Moreno et al., 2008; Sola
et al., 2015).
On the full-length gRNA itself, two partially overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and
ORF1b) are translated from the same start codon at the 5 end, resulting in the polyproteins
′

pp1a and pp1ab. Translation of the longer product pp1ab is made possible by a hairpin-type
pseudoknot RNA structure known as the frameshifting element (FSE) which regulates a
programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting that overrides with about 50% efficiency the stop
codon of ORF1a (Kelly et al., 2020; Namy et al., 2006). Previous studies applied RNA
structure probing techniques using selective 2 -hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer
′

extension (SHAPE) and DMS, as well as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to effectively
identify conserved cis-acting RNA structures regulating the life cycle of coronaviruses.
However, when it comes to identifying long-distance base-pairing between distal nucleotides,
these methods fall short. Therefore, the long-range RNA-RNA interactome of coronaviruses
has never been mapped in full. Deciphering how the various structural elements along the
coronavirus gRNA and sgmRNA are folded and brought together in time and space is vital
for understanding, dissecting and manipulating viral replication, discontinuous transcription,
and translation regulation.

We recently developed Crosslinking Of Matched RNAs And Deep Sequencing
(COMRADES) for in-depth RNA conformation capture in living cells (Ziv et al., 2018).
COMRADES is derived from a class of methods that combine psoralen crosslinking of base
paired RNA and deep sequencing (Aw et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2016; Sharma et al., 2016).
COMRADES utilizes a clickable psoralen derivative to specifically crosslink paired
nucleotides, and high throughput sequencing to retrieve their positions (Figure 1). Following
in vivo crosslinking, the viral RNA is selectively captured, fragmented and subjected to a
click-chemistry reaction to add a biotin tag to crosslinked fragments. Crosslinked RNA
duplexes are then selectively captured using streptavidin affinity purification. Half of the
resulting RNA is proximity ligated, following reversal of the crosslink to create chimeric
RNA templates for high throughput sequencing. The other half is used as a control, in which
reversal of the crosslink precedes the proximity ligation, and accurately represents the
background level of non-specific ligation. The coupling of two biotin-streptavidin mediated
enrichment steps, first of viral RNA, and second of crosslinked RNA duplexes provides high
structural depth for identification of both long- and short-lived conformations. COMRADES
can therefore measure (i) the structural diversity of alternative RNA conformations that co3

exist inside cells; (ii) short-distance, as well as long-distance (over tens of thousands of
nucleotides) base-pairing within the same RNA molecule; and (iii) base-pairing between
different RNA molecules, such as those of host and viral origin (Kudla et al., 2020; Ziv et al.,
2018).

Here we apply COMRADES to study the structural diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 gRNA and
sgmRNA inside cells. We discover networks of short- and long-range RNA-RNA interactions
spanning the entirety of SARS-CoV-2 gRNA and sgmRNA. We reveal site-specific
interactions with the host transcriptome. Finally, we uncover a conserved long-range
structure encompassing the programmed ribosomal frameshifting element.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The SARS-CoV-2 genome and sgmRNA adopt alternative co-existing topologies that
involve long-distance base-pairing

Inside the host, the gRNA of SARS-CoV-2 is transcribed into sgmRNA (Figure 2A). To
compare the structure of both types of RNA, we applied the COMRADES method and set up
a dual enrichment strategy to analyse the positive sense gRNA and positive sense sgmRNA
separately (Figure 2B). Briefly, we selectively pulled down the full-length positive sense
SARS-CoV-2 genome from in vivo crosslinked, SARS-CoV-2 inoculated Vero E6/TMPRSS2
cells (Matsuyama et al., 2020), using a tiling array of antisense probes for ORF1a/b, which
resulted in a highly enriched gRNA fraction (Figure 2C). The full-length positive sense
sgmRNA was subsequently enriched from the gRNA-depleted supernatant of the first
pulldown, using a second tiling array of antisense probes to the region downstream of
ORF1a/b (Figure 2B). This dual enrichment strategy resulted in a high degree of separation
between the gRNA and the sgmRNA (Figure 2C). COMRADES provided >6 million nonredundant chimeric reads, which was sufficient to generate high-resolution maps for both the
gRNA and sgmRNA with a high signal to noise ratio (Figure S1), and high reproducibility
between independent biological replicates (r = 0.92, p value <2.2e-16, Figure 2D,E). Our
structural data covered >99.99% of the coronavirus gRNA and the sgmRNA (Figure 2C), and
represents the base-pairing nature of SARS-CoV-2 gRNA and sgmRNA inside cells.

Available models for the RNA structure of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses are largely
confined to short-distance base-pairing which result in local folding of important cis-acting
elements (Andrews et al., 2020; Huston et al., 2020; Kelly et al., 2020; Lan et al., 2020;
Manfredonia et al., 2020; Ryder, 2020; Sanders et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020). However, longdistance base-pairing between distal RNA elements are equally essential for many RNA
viruses (Huber et al., 2019), including coronaviruses (Mateos-Gómez et al., 2011; MateosGomez et al., 2013; Moreno et al., 2008; Sola et al., 2015). The ability of COMRADES to
capture RNA base-pairing regardless of the distance between the interacting bases enabled us
to confirm in vivo the structure of nearly all previously characterised cis-acting elements
(with one exception, discussed below) and to discover long-distance RNA-RNA interactions
as they occur inside cells. Indeed, we observed a high prevalence of long-range RNA basepairing along the SARS-CoV-2 genome, with ORF1a demonstrating more long-range
connectivity than any other ORF (Figure 2F). Most of the base-pairing is confined to a single
ORF, however, some interactions cross ORF boundaries. For example, ORF1a base-pairs
with ORF1b, as well as with the 5 and 3 untranslated regions (UTRs) (Figure 2F). We
′

′

additionally discovered long-distance interactions unique to the sgmRNA (Figure 2G).
Previous models of the SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses mainly analysed structural
population averages, i.e. assuming that all copies of the genome and sgmRNA have a single
static conformation. Yet, the complex life cycle of viral RNA genomes, i.e. their engagement
with multiple cellular and viral machineries such as the ones for replication, transcription,
and translation, suggests a dynamic RNA structure, as we and others have reported for Zika
virus (Huber et al., 2019; Li et al., 2018; Ziv et al., 2018) and for HIV-1 (Tomezsko et al.,
2020). Our structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 reveals a high level of structural dynamics
whereby alternative high-order conformations, some of which involve long-distance basepairing, co-exist in vivo (Figures 3 and S2A, Table S1). For example, nucleotides 5,660-5,680
in ORF1a interact with three alternative distal regions: 3.6 kb upstream, 3.4 kb downstream,
and 2 kb upstream (Figure 3, arches 4, 5 and 8 respectively), and the 5 UTR interacts with
′

ORF1a as well as with the 3 UTR (Figure 3, arches 2 and 3 respectively). In contrast, we
′

find that ORF N sgmRNA is held in a single dominant conformation where the leader
sequence interacts exclusively with a region 0.8 kb downstream (Figure S2B). In summary,
we discover the co-existence of alternative SARS-CoV-2 gRNA and sgmRNA topologies,
held by long-range base-pairing between regions tens of thousands of nucleotides apart. Each
topology brings in physical proximity previously characterised and new elements involved in

viral replication and discontinuous transcription, therefore offering a model for facilitating
distinct patterns of template switching to produce the complete SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome.

The SARS-CoV-2 genome engages in different interactions with cellular host RNA

The infectious life cycle of coronaviruses takes place mainly in the host cell’s cytoplasm,
where many cellular RNAs reside (Sola et al., 2015). Host-virus RNA-RNA interactions
regulate the replication of some RNA viruses, e.g. the interaction between hepatitis C virus
and human microRNA miR-122 (Jopling et al., 2005), the interaction between Zika virus and
human miR-21 (Ziv et al., 2018), and the priming of HIV-1 replication by human tRNAs
(Mak and Kleiman, 1997). However, to the best of our knowledge, whether the SARS-CoV-2
gRNA or sgmRNA interact with cellular RNA is unknown. Our COMRADES method
provides an opportunity to undertake an unbiased analysis of the host-virus RNA-RNA
interactome (Ziv et al., 2018). We discovered site-specific interactions between the SARSCoV-2 RNA and various cellular RNAs, especially small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) (Figures
4A,B and S3A,B). Apart from their canonical role in splicing, snRNAs mature in the
cytoplasm and may have additional biological roles (Matera et al., 2014). Along the viral
gRNA, cellular snRNA interactions are mostly confined to ORF1a and ORF1b, and include
site specific binding of U1, U2 and U4 snRNAs. The gRNA coding region for the sgmRNA
ORFs and the UTRs are largely devoid of snRNA binding. In contrast, along the viral
sgmRNA, both the N ORF and the 3 UTR show high occupancy of U1 and U2 snRNA
′

binding. In order to explore the conservation of these snRNA interactions in a related
coronavirus, we performed COMRADES on MERS-CoV-inoculated Huh-7 cells. Similarly
to SARS-CoV-2, we identified a site-specific interaction of U2 snRNA within the MERSCoV ORF1a (Figures 4C and S3C), illustrating the evolutionary conservation of the U2
snRNA base-pairing with ORF1a of betacoronaviruses. In addition to cellular small RNAs
we also detected long cellular RNAs interacting with SARS-CoV-2 RNA, although to a lesser
extent. Of specific interest, the RNase MRP RNA was found to base-pair with an extended 3

′

region of the sgmRNA, but not the gRNA, of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure S3D). The RNase MRP
RNA has a conserved secondary structure similar to that of the RNA component of the
bacterial RNase P ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex (Dávila López et al., 2009; Welting et
al., 2006). The RNase MRP RNA has a role in human pre-ribosomal RNA processing
(Goldfarb and Cech, 2017), when mutated leads to a spectrum of human disease (Ridanpää et
al., 2001), and has been implicated in viral RNA degradation (Jaag et al., 2011). Targeting

host-virus RNA-RNA interactions provides an attractive platform for developing new
antiviral therapies, as resistance would require the virus to acquire considerable mutational
changes to become independent of the host RNA. However, whereas multiple tools and
efforts are dedicated to identifying host-virus protein-protein interactions, the crosstalk
between host and virus RNA remains largely unexplored. Coupled with the recent
advancement in techniques to target RNA in vivo, COMRADES’s capacity to map the hostvirus RNA-RNA interactome opens up new opportunities to control emerging RNA viruses.
The data we present here could be valuable for the development of new targets for antiviral
drugs.

The UTRs of SARS-CoV-2 interact with distal genomic regions and with each other

The 5 UTR of coronaviruses contain five evolutionary conserved stem-loop structures
′

(denoted SL1-SL5) that are essential for genome replication and discontinuous transcription
(Madhugiri et al., 2016). The 3 UTR contains 3 structural elements important for replication:
′

an evolutionary conserved bulged stem-loop (BSL) (Hsue and Masters, 1997), a partially
overlapping hairpin-type pseudoknot (Goebel et al., 2004; Williams et al., 1999), and a 3

′

terminal multiple stem-loop structure containing a hyper-variable region (HVR), which folds
back to create a triple helix junction (Liu et al., 2013). Our analysis identified seven of these
eight cis-acting elements within the UTRs (Figures 5A and S4A). However, our data did not
support the folding of the stem-loop pseudoknot at the 3 UTR. Of note, two recent studies
′

using SHAPE methods to map the structure of SARS-CoV-2 inside cells similarly failed to
identify this pseudoknot (Huston et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020), and a previous study
demonstrated the instability of this pseudoknot in the related mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)
(Stammler et al., 2011).

In addition to the canonical UTR structures, we provide here a direct in vivo evidence for
genome cyclization in SARS-CoV-2, mediated by long-range base-pairing between the 5 and
′

3 UTRs (Figures 5B and S4B). This base-pairing spans a distance of 29.7 kilobases and is
′

among the longest distance RNA-RNA interactions ever reported. Genome cyclization was
previously hypothesised from mutational analyses of murine coronavirus (MHV) and was
suggested to facilitate discontinuous transcription (Li et al., 2008). However, while MHV
genome cyclization involves the 5 SL1 structure, we find that in SARS-CoV-2, this process
′

is mediated by the 5 SL3 instead, and results in complete opening of SL3 and disruption of

the triple helix junction in the 3 UTR (Figure 5B). In agreement with this observation, SL3
′

of related betacoronaviruses was suggested to be weakly folded or unfolded (Chen and
Olsthoorn, 2010; Li et al., 2008). Genome cyclization plays an essential role in the replication
of a number of RNA viruses, including flaviviruses (Hahn et al., 1987; Ziv et al., 2018). The
evolutionary selection of such a mechanism might stem from in-cell competition between
intact and defective viral genomes, as it ensures that only genomes bearing two intact UTRs
engage with the replication machinery. The SARS-CoV-2 genome cyclization we report here
results in a complete opening of the 5 SL3 where the Transcription Regulating Sequence′

Leader (TRS-L) resides, raising the possibility that genome cyclization regulates SARS-CoV2 discontinuous transcription, as was previously suggested for MHV (Li et al., 2008). It
remains to be seen whether this base-pairing can be targeted to inhibit viral replication in
vivo.

In addition to genome cyclization, we identified two alternative conformations involving
long-distance RNA-RNA interactions between each UTR and ORF1a. These long-distance
conformations result in unfolding of SL2 and SL3 in the 5 UTR (Figures 5C and S4C), and
′

unfolding of the terminal stem-loop in the 3 UTR (Figures 5D and S4D). Of note, unlike the
′

gRNA, the leader sequence within the 5 UTR of ORF N sgmRNA is held in a single long′

range conformation through base-pairing with a region 0.8 kb downstream (Figures 5E, S2B
and S4E). All of the long-range interactions described above are strongly supported through
chimeric reads (Figures 5F and S2A). Overall, our data demonstrate the existence of
alternative, mutually exclusive UTR conformations inside cells, involving interactions
between functional UTR elements and distal regions within the ORFs. We further show that
the N ORF sgmRNA folds differently than the viral genome. The long-distance RNA
structure map for SARS-CoV-2 provides a practical starting point to dissect the regulation of
discontinuous transcription, as it identifies cis-acting elements that interact with each other to
create genome topologies that favour the synthesis of the ensemble of sgmRNAs.

A long-range structural arch encircling the SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting element (FSEarch) is under purifying selection

RNA viruses evolve sophisticated mechanisms to enhance the functional capacity of their
size-restricted genomes and to regulate the expression levels of their replicase components. In
coronaviruses, one such mechanism is programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting to facilitate

translation of ORF1b which contains the viral RdRp activity, and to set a defined ratio of
ORF1a and ORF1b products (Plant et al., 2010). This is mediated by a ~120 nucleotide long
cis-acting frameshifting element (FSE) composed of a stem-loop attenuator, and a slippery
sequence followed by a single-stranded spacer and an RNA pseudoknot (Kelly et al., 2020).
It has been suggested that pausing the progression of the ribosome upstream of the
pseudoknot facilitates a tandem-slippage of the peptidyl-tRNA and aminoacyl-tRNA to the
−1 reading frame, thus allowing continuous translation through the stop codon at the end of
ORF1a (Brierley et al., 1989). Altering the frameshifting mechanism had a deleterious effect
on SARS-CoV replication (Plant et al., 2013), making the FSE an attractive target for
antiviral therapy. Understanding the surrounding RNA structure and function is therefore of
great importance as it might aid the design of drugs targeting the FSE. Unexpectedly, we find
that the FSE of SARS-CoV-2 is embedded within a much larger, ~1.5 kb long higher-order
structure that bridges the 3 end of ORF1a with the 5 region of ORF1b, which we termed the
′

′

FSE-arch (Figure 6A,B). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a long-range
structural bridge has been reported for any coronavirus, and importantly this structure is
supported by the largest number of chimeric reads in our data (more than tens of thousands of
non-redundant chimeric reads) (Figures S6A,B), reflecting its high folding stability in vivo.
The FSE-arch results in a stem-loop structure encompassing 1,475 nucleotides, and bearing
the FSE within it (Figures 6B and S5C). We hypothesized that if an RNA-RNA interaction is
functionally important, there should be purifying selection and hence reduced nucleotide
evolution rate in this region. Therefore we used a recent dataset (Firth, 2020) to explore the
nucleotide conservation of the FSE-arch (Figure 6C). Strikingly, the FSE-arch is under a
strong purifying selection and is among the most conserved regions within the SARS-CoV-2
genome. Consistent with this, analysing the phylogeny of the SARS-related coronavirus
subgenus (taxid: 2509511) revealed two positions of covariance that support the conservation
of the FSE-arch (Figure 6B). To further explore this structure experimentally, we analysed its
existence in MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV shares only ~50% sequence identity with SARS-CoV2 (Chen et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020), yet even so, performing COMRADES on MERS-CoVinoculated Huh-7 cells revealed a strong evidence for an homologous FSE-arch surrounding
the MERS-CoV FSE, bridging ORF1a with ORF1b (Figure 6D,E). While the mechanism
governing the FSE-arch formation will require further investigation, similar long-distance
interactions around the frameshifting elements of several plant RNA viruses were previously
demonstrated to regulate frameshifting, possibly by assisting in back-stepping of ribosomes at
the slippery sequence, and by stabilising the FSE, allowing it to refold after the passage of

each ribosome (Barry and Miller, 2002; Cimino et al., 2011; Gao and Simon, 2016; Tajima et
al., 2011).

In addition to their coding capacity, nucleic acids have evolved structural capabilities to sense
metabolites (Mandal and Breaker, 2004), catalyse reactions (Pyle, 1993), and interact with
other cellular components. When brought in physical proximity, different combinations of
cis-acting sequences can lead to new biological activities. For example, interactions between
promoters and enhancers dictate the rate of transcription along the eukaryotic genome
(Rowley and Corces, 2018). Great effort is being made to reveal the structural landscapes of
the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Andrews et al., 2020; Huston et al., 2020; Kelly et al., 2020; Lan
et al., 2020; Manfredonia et al., 2020; Ryder, 2020; Sanders et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020).
However, without deciphering the long-range connectivity, our understanding is far from
being complete. Here we reveal how cis-acting elements along the coronavirus genome are
folded and alternate between different topologies to create spatial combinations of functional
RNA elements. The combinatorial nature of the coronavirus genome inside the host cell as
discussed here, provides molecular insights into the replication, discontinuous transcription
and ribosomal frameshifting machineries of coronaviruses and will facilitate the discovery of
new functional cis-acting elements and the design of RNA-based antiviral therapies for
SARS-CoV-2.

FIGURE LEGENDS

Figure 1. The COMRADES method.
Virus inoculated cells are crosslinked using clickable psoralen. Viral RNA is pulled down
from the cell lysate using an array of biotinylated DNA probes, following digestion of the
DNA probes and fragmentation of the RNA. Biotin is attached to crosslinked RNA duplexes
via click chemistry, enabling pulling down crosslinked RNA using StreptAvidin beads. Half
of the RNA duplexes are proximity ligated, following reversal of the crosslinking to enable
sequencing. The other half serves as a control, in which crosslink reversal proceeds the
proximity ligation.

Material & Methods

Cell lines. Chlorocebus sabaeus (Green monkey) VeroE6 (female, RRID:CVCL_YQ49)
were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, id: ATCC CRL-1586).
VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (female, doi: 10.1073/pnas.2002589117) were kindly provided by
Prof. Dr. Stefan Pöhlmann (German Primate Center, Göttingen). Vero E6 and
VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator. HuH7
(Homo sapiens, male, adult hepatocellular carcinoma, RRID:CVCL_0336) cells were
purchased from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (JCRB) Cell Bank (JCRB
No. JCRB0403) and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator. All cell
lines were regularly examined to exclude mycoplasma contamination.

Viral Infection and psoralen crosslinking. Infection experiments were performed under
biosafety level 3 conditions. Independent biological replicates were performed using 90-120
million cells each. Titration of virus stocks was conducted using Vero E6 cells. For SARSCoV-2 infection, VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (PMID: 32165541) were inoculated with SARSCoV-2 strain München-1.2/2020/984 at MOI=2 pfu/cell for 20 hours. For MERS infection,
HuH7 cells were inoculated with MERS-CoV strain EMC/2012 (GenBank: JX869059.2;
PMID: 23170002) at MOI=2 pfu/cell for 20 hours. Following inoculation, cells were washed

3 times with PBS and were incubated for 20 minutes with 0.4 mg/ml Psoralen-triethylene
glycol azide (psoralen-TEG azide, Berry & Associates) diluted in PBS and supplemented
with OptiMEM I with no phenol-red (Gibco). Cells were subsequently irradiated on ice with
50 KJ/m2 365 nm UVA using a CL-1000 crosslinker (UVP). Cell lysis was performed by
RNeasy lysis buffer (Qiagen) supplemented with DTT. Proteins were degraded using
proteinase K (NEB) and RNA was purified using RNeasy maxi kit (Qiagen).

Viral RNA enrichment. Total cellular RNA was mixed with a tiling array of 50 biotinylated
DNA probes, 20 nucleotides-long each (IDT), antisense to ORF1a and ORF1b of the viral
genomic RNA, and was maintained at 37 °C for 12 hours rotating in 500 mM NaCl, 0.7%
SDS, 33 mM Tris-Cl pH 7, 0.7 mM EDTA, 10% Formamide. Dynabeads MyOne
Streptavidin C1 (Invitrogen) were added during the final incubation hour. Beads containing
the gRNA were captured on a magnet, while gRNA depleted supernatants were used for
isolating the viral sgmRNA using a second tiling array of 50 biotinylated probes antisense to
the sgmRNA ORFs as described in the text. Beads were washed 5 times with 2x SSC buffer
supplemented with 0.5% SDS. RNA was released from the beads using 0.1 units/µl Turbo
DNase (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 30 minutes and was cleaned using RNA Clean &
Concentrator (Zymo Research).

Cross-linked RNA enrichment. Viral enriched gRNA and sgmRNA fractions were
fragmented by incubating at 37 °C for 20 minutes with 0.1 units/µl RNase III (Ambion).
Reactions were terminated by cleaning with RNA Clean & Concentrator (Zymo Research).
Biotin was attached to cross-linked RNA duplexes by incubating with 150 µM Click-IT
Biotin sDIBO Alkyne (Life technologies) under constant agitation at 37 °C for 1.5 hours .
Residual Biotin sDIBO Alkyne was removed by RNA Clean & Concentrator (Zymo
Research). Biotinylated RNA duplexes were enriched using Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin
C1 (Invitrogen) at the following reaction conditions: 100 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA,
1 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.5 unit/µl Superase-In (Invitrogen). Beads were washed 5 times
on a magnet with 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 3.5 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20.
RNA was eluted by adding 95% Formamide, 10 mM EDTA solution preheated to 65oC and
purified using RNA Clean & Concentrator (Zymo Research).

Proximity ligation and crosslink reversal. Each RNA sample was divided in two: one half
was used for proximity ligation and then crosslink reversal (i.e. COMRADES sample), while

in the other half, crosslink reversal was done before proximity ligation (i.e. control sample).
Prior to proximity ligation, RNA was denatured by briefly heating to 95 °C. Proximity
ligation was done under the following conditions: 1 unit/µl RNA ligase 1 (New England
Biolabs), 1x RNA ligase buffer, 50 µM ATP, 1 unit/µl Superase-in (Invitrogen), final
volume: 200 µl. Reactions were incubated for 16 hours at 16 °C and were terminated by
cleaning with RNA Clean & Concentrator (Zymo Research). Crosslink reversal was done by
irradiating the RNA on ice with 2.5 KJ/m2 254 nm UVC using a CL-1000 crosslinker (UVP).
Sequencing library preparation. Library preparation was done as described in (Ziv et al.,
2018), using 6N unique molecular identifiers to eliminate PCR biases. Pre-adenylated
adapters were used and all ligation reactions were carried without ATP to reduce ligation
artefacts. All libraries and controls went through 13 PCR cycles using KAPA HiFi HotStart
Ready Mix (KAPA Biosystems). PCR products were size-selected on a 1.8% agarose gel
before loading on a Novaseq (Illumina) for paired-end 150 bp runs. Total of ~1.6 billion
sequences were achieved for this study.

Data Pre-processing. Data pre-processing was performed according to (Ziv et al., 2018). In
brief, raw paired-end reads were trimmed for adaptors and checked for quality using cutadapt
(Martin, 2011). Trimmed paired-end reads were assembled into single reads using the
program pear (https://cme.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/pear/doc.html). PCR duplicates
were

removed

using

unique

molecular

identifiers

via

collapse.py

(https://gitlab.com/tdido/tstk). Chimeric reads were identified and annotated to the respective
genome using hyb (Travis et al., 2014). SARS-CoV2 samples were processed using the
Chlorocebus sabaeus reference genome (ChlSab1.1) with the addition of the SARS-CoV-2
sequence (NC_045512.2). MERS samples were processed using the Homo sapiens reference
genome (GRCh38) with the addition of MERS (NC_019843.3).

Clustering of chimeras into chimeric groups. Due to crosslinking and fragmentation, the
COMRADES data can provide redundant structural information whereby the same in vivo
structure produces sequencing reads differing by a few nucleotides. This results in increased
computation load of folding each chimeric read separately. To overcome this issue, and to
gain better structure predictions, the reads were clustered into chimeric groups. Each chimeric
read is composed of a left side (L) and right side (R), each originated from a different position
along the gRNA or sgmRNA. Each chimeric read can therefore be described as (g): the

16

genomic distance between L and R, and chimeric reads that originated from the same
structure will have a similar g and can be clustered based on their g values.

Clustering of chimeric reads that originated from the same structure was performed using a
network-based approach whereby an adjacency matrix is created for all chimeric reads based
on the nucleotide difference between their g values (Deltagap).

Deltagap(gi, gj) = max( width(gi), width(gj) ) - widthofIntersection(gi , gj)
This results in Deltagap=0 for identically overlapping gaps, and increasing Deltagap values
for chimeric reads that share less overlapping sites. The clustering was performed twice per
sample, once for the chimeric reads that represent short stem structures (g <= 10 nt) and once
for chimeric reads that represent long distance interactions (g > 10 nt). Short range
interactions weights were calculated as:
E(gi,gj) =

10 - Deltagap(gi, gj).

This allows exactly overlapping gaps to have the highest weight, and gaps with no overlaps to
have a weight of 0. For long range interactions weights were calculated as:
E(gi,gj) = 15 - Deltagap(gi, gj)
Long range interactions with weights lower than 0 were set to 0, meaning that gaps that differ
by more than 15 nucleotides could not be considered as part of the same chimeric group. The
weighted graphs created for long- and short-range interactions consisted of g as vertices and
weights as edges:
G = (V,E) using iGraph (http://www.interjournal.org/manuscript_abstract.php?361100992).
To identify densely connected subgraphs (communities) with chimeric groups containing
chimeric reads that originated from the same structure, we clustered the graph using random
walks with the cluster_waltrap function (steps = 2) from the iGraph package. Chimeric
groups containing less than 10 chimeric reads were discarded. Chimeric groups often
contained a small amount of longer L or R sequences due to the random fragmentation in the
COMRADES protocol. To avoid introducing biases in the folding results, clusters were
trimmed to the region from L to R for which evidence in the cluster is higher than the mean
evidence - 2 standard deviations.

Folding. Folding of the chimeric groups was performed using the Vienna package (Lorenz et
al., 2011). For short range chimeric groups RNAFold was used (with default parameters) and
for long range chimeric groups RNADuplex was used (with default parameters).

Covariation analysis. Complete Sarbecovirus sequences were taken from the NCBI Virus
Database website (taxid: 2509511, 17 June 2020 version). Sequences containing unidentified
nucleotides were discarded. Four sequence sets for MSA (multiple sequence analysis) were
generated:
(I) MSA-1-SARSrel-3515seq: includes all complete non-redundant Sarbecovirus sequences.
MUSCLE ((Edgar, 2004)), (default parameters).
(II) MSA-2-SARSrel-3515seq: Includes all complete non-redundant Sarbecovirus sequences
containing only the four canonical nucleotide identifiers. MUSCLE (parameters, -maxiters
2).
(III) MSA-3-SARSrel-137seq: pairwise distances between the sequences in (I) were
calculated using the mbed function in the kmer package (Blackshields et al., 2010). The
“seeds” attribute was used to extract the sequence indices of all seed sequences. These seed
sequences were included in this multiple sequence alignment. This resulted in a smaller
sequence set but with a representative variation as (I). MUSCLE (default parameters).
(IV) MSA-4-SARSrel-559seq: The unaligned sequences used to generate (II) were divided
into seven smaller sequence sets (six 500-sequences sets and one 515-sequence set). The seed
sequences (“seeds” attribute of the mbed function in the kmer package

(https://cran.r-

project.org/package=kmer)) for all seven sets were combined in a new sequence set to be
aligned to make up multiple sequence alignment (IV). This resulted in a sequence set with
less sequences than (I), but more than (III) and representative variation as (I). MUSCLE
(default parameters).

In all cases the NCBI reference genome for SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2) was used as
reference. For each of the four sequence alignments, the following steps were taken:
(I) SARS-CoV-2 COMRADES cluster coordinates. For long-range clusters (defined above)
the segments defined by the coordinates of the left and right side of the respective cluster
were extracted from the MSA, and fused together to form a smaller MSA containing only the
aligned left and right side sequences. For short-range clusters (defined as above) the whole
region defined by the start position of the left side and the end position of the right side was
extracted. Those segments of the full MSA will be referred to as “cluster alignments”. In both

cases, any sequence starting with more than 10 empty positions was removed from that
cluster alignment.
(II) The cluster alignments were analyzed with R-Scape (Rivas et al., 2017) using default
parameters.
(iii) The R-Scape output for each candidate co-varying pair includes an E-value statistical
score (probability of a false positive result for the respective position pair in the cluster
alignment). The default significance level of 0.05 was kept, so only position pairs with Evalues smaller than 0.05 were considered in the subsequent analysis.
(iv) Results tables of R-scape output combined with the corresponding coordinates in the
non-aligned SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence, as well as nucleotide combination frequencies
at the two positions across the alignment. We defined secondary base-pairing frequency as
the percentage of sequences in which the pair of nucleotides differed from the most common
base-pair type at the position but could still form a base-pair. For example, an imaginary pair
of nucleotides has the composition:
A--T (94%); G--C(3%), G--T(2%); C--T(1%),
And its secondary base-pairing frequency is 83.3%. For further steps of the analysis (folding
predictions), we consider only candidate pairs with 90% secondary base-pairing frequency.

Covariation analysis of sgmRNA chimera clusters. The alignments described above were
shortened to include the leader sequence fused to the full-length of mRNA-S, and were
subsequently used here. A modified version of the code used from full genome chimera
clusters was used.

Sequence conservation analysis of the extended FSE structure. Genome conservation data
analyzed with synplot2 (Firth, 2014) was taken from (Firth, 2020). These data were aligned with
our structural data and displayed in Figure 6C.
