ABSTRACT
The global COVID-19 pandemic motivates accelerated research to develop safe and
efficacious vaccines. To address this need, we leveraged a biomaterial vaccine
technology that consists of mesoporous silica rods (MSRs) that provide a sustained
release of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and adjuvants to
concentrate and mature antigen-presenting cells at the vaccine site. Here we explored
the humoral responses resulting from the use of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) as the
adjuvant and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins S1, S2, the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and
receptor binding domain (RBD) as the target antigens. The dose of antigen and impact of
pre-manufacturing of vaccines as versus loading antigen just-in-time was explored in
these studies. Single shot MSR vaccines induced rapid and robust antibody titers to the
presented antigens, even without the use of a boost, and sera from vaccinated animals
demonstrated neutralizing activity against a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. Overall, these
results suggest the MSR vaccine system may provide potent protective immunity when
utilized to present SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

INTRODUCTION
In late December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology was
announced in Wuhan, China (1,2). In January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) identified that a novel coronavirus, known as Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was the causative agent of a new
respiratory tract disease, now called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (3,4). COVID19 rapidly advanced from an epidemic to a pandemic, and as of July 6, 2020 the World
Health Organization (WHO) has reported 11,327,790 confirmed cases, resulting in
532,340 deaths worldwide (5).

Many strategies to combat COVID-19 are currently being implemented; among them
include contact tracing, convalescent plasma therapy, anti-viral drug therapy, and vaccine
development (6-9). Here, we focus on vaccine development. SARS-CoV-2 contains many
structural components that provide promising target candidates, including the spike (S)
proteins, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and receptor binding domain (RBD) (10,11). The S
protein is of particular interest due to its demonstrated ability to induce potent neutralizing
antibodies and T-cell responses against SARS-CoV in previous studies (12-14). Two
functional subunits comprise the S protein – S1, which contains the RBD that is critical
for interacting with the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and
S2, which mediates the fusion of viral and host cell membranes to release RNA for
replication (15,16). The sequence identity of the S protein between SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 is on the order of 76%, while RBD epitope homology is around 74%, and
both respective virus types utilize ACE2 for viral entry (17).

Here we explored the ability of a biomaterial vaccine based on mesoporous silica rods
(MSRs), which upon subcutaneous injection will spontaneously assemble to form a 3D
macroporous structure, to generate humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 relevant
antigens. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a potent
cytokine, is incorporated on the MSRs, and its sustained release leads to the
accumulation of large numbers of antigen presenting cells (APCs) at the vaccine site (18).
The MSRs are also loaded with an adjuvant, and the sustained adjuvant release leads to
maturation of the accumulated APCs, and a sustained trafficking of antigen-loaded APCs
to the draining lymph node where they present antigen to B and T cells (18). A single
injection of the MSR vaccine delivering protein or peptide antigens elicits persistent
germinal center B-cell activity (>3 weeks), highly elevated antibody responses (>12
months), superior memory B-cell generation, and potent CTL responses (19,20) as well
as an adjuvant and antigen. We have previous shown the broad-spectrum capability of
this vaccine technology, demonstrating immunogenicity and efficacy against viral and
bacterial pathogens (18-21).

To explore the ability of the MSR vaccine to induce potent, SARS-CoV-2 relevant humoral
responses in rodents, here we loaded with the SARS-CoV-2 antigens, and the adjuvant
monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), a TLR-4 agonist (22). The MSR vaccine offers a number
of advantages over traditional vaccines. First, it is modular, allowing for a highly
adaptable, plug-and-play nature for inclusion of various antigens and adjuvants. This
feature was exploited in the current study by exploring the inclusion of several

combinations of different protein antigens - S1, S2, N, and RBD. This modularity also
potentially allows a rapid response to pandemics, ease of manufacture and production
scale up. The dose of antigen was varied in these studies, and vaccines in which the
antigens were pre-loaded onto MSRs before storage and subsequent vaccination, as
versus added just before vaccination, were compared to further demonstrate the
versatility of this technology. Our results demonstrate the development of rapid and robust
antibody titers against all three SARS-CoV-2 proteins that were tested, in all vaccine
configurations. We also demonstrate the antibodies induced by our vaccines confer
functional neutralization against a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Vaccine components. To generate mesoporous silica rods (MSR) (~46 μm × 4.5 μm), 4
g of the surfactant, P123 (Mn ~5,800, Sigma Aldrich, USA), was dissolved in 150 g of 1.6
M Hydrochloric acid (HCl), then stirred with 8.6 g of tetraethyl orthosilicate (98%, Sigma
Aldrich, USA) at 40°C for 20 hrs, followed by aging at 100°C for 24 hrs. The surfactant
was then extracted by refluxing the particles for 24 hrs in 1% HCl in 70% ethanol. The
resulting MSR particles were filtered, washed with 70% ethanol, and dried. MSR
morphology was measured and determined using optical microscopy and scanning
electron microscopy. Pore volume, pore size, and surface area were analyzed by N2
adsorption/desorption isotherms. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF) was purchased from Peprotech, USA (315-03). Monophosphoryl lipid A
(MPLA) derived from Salmonella minnesota R595 was purchased from Invivogen, USA
(vac-mpla). SARS-CoV-2 antigens included spike protein subunits, S1 (40591-V08H), S2

(40590-V08B), and nucleocapsid (N) protein (40588-V08B) was purchased from Sino
Biological, USA, and the receptor binding domain (RBD) protein (NR-52306) was
purchased from BEI resources, USA.

Vaccine manufacture. The vaccine formulations for each group are outlined in Table 1.
To make the complete vaccine, 5 mg of MSR was added to a vial followed by 1 μg of GMCSF, 25 μg of MPLA and the respective SARS antigen. For Group A1, the antigens were
1 µg of S1, S2, and N; for Group B the antigen were 1 µg of S1, S2, and RBD; for Group
C the antigens were 5 µg of S1, S2, and RBD; and for Group D the antigen was 1 µg of
RBD. Next, 0.5 ml water for injection (WFI, HyClone, USA) was added to the vial, and the
resulting slurry was vortexed and mixed overnight (~15 hrs) using a HulaMixer
(ThermoScientific, USA) set at 45 rpm. Finally, the mixture was frozen at -80°C and
lyophilized for a minimum of 48 hrs (Fig. 1A). To make the sham and shell vaccines, 5
mg of MSR was added to a vial followed by 1 μg of GM-CSF and 25 μg of MPLA. 0.5 ml
WFI was added to the vial, and the resulting slurry was vortexed and mixed overnight
(~15 hrs) using a HulaMixer set at 45 rpm. Next, the mixture was frozen at -80°C and
lyophilized for a minimum of 48 hrs. Antigens in Group A2 (1 µg of S1, S2, and N) were
added to shell vaccines and allowed to mix 30 min before immunization. No antigen was
added to sham vaccines (Fig. 1B).

Animals and vaccination. Eight-week-old BALB/c female mice (n=10 per group) were
vaccinated subcutaneously in the flank using an 18G needle. PBS was used as the
unvaccinated control (naïve). All the mice were bled from submandibular vein. After

collection, the whole blood was allowed to clot at room temperature for 30 min. To remove
the clot, blood was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 minutes. The supernatant
representing serum was aliquoted and stored at appropriate temperature. Four weeks
after the primary immunization, mice were boosted subcutaneously with the same dose
as the initial vaccine. Mice are maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at
Harvard University, and all experiments are conducted in accordance with animal use
guidelines and protocols approved by the Harvard University Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC).

Antibody titers. To evaluate the IgG antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 proteins,
polystyrene 96-well high-bind plates (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) were coated with
100 µl of 1 µg/mL of S1, S2, and RBD in PBS. A standard curve was applied to each plate
starting with 100 µl of 50 ng/ml (015-000-003, Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA) and twofold serially diluted down, leaving the last wells as just PBS. Plates were left to incubate
overnight at 4°C. The following day, the plates were washed and blocked with blocking
buffer (1% BSA in TBST 5mM CaCl2) for 1 hr. Sera was diluted 1:100, 1:1,000, 1:10,000
in blocking buffer and 100 µl was added to the plates, then incubated for 1.5 hrs at 37°C
on a plate shaker at 450 rpm. After sera incubation, the plates were washed and
Peroxidase-AffiniPure F(ab’)2 Fragment Goat anti-mouse IgG (111-036-047, Jackson
ImmunoResearch, USA) diluted to 1:20,000 in blocking buffer was added to every well
and incubated for 1 hr using a plate shaker set to 450 rpm at room temperature. The
plates were washed and 100 µl TMB Ultra (34028, ThermoFisher, USA) was added to all
the wells and statically incubated under aluminum foil for 15 min. The reaction was

quenched using 50 µl of 1M sulfuric acid and measured at OD 450nm. Samples were run
in duplicates and standards in triplicate. All plate washes were done in triplicate with 200
µl of TBST 5mM CaCl2 using a BioTek microplate washer. Standard curve OD readouts
on each plate were used to create a 4PL-sigmoidal curve to interpolate sample data,
which was analyzed, processed, and presented using GraphPad Prism 8 (version 8.1.2).

Pseudovirus neutralization assay. The SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses expressing a
luciferase reporter gene were generated in an approach similar to as described previously
(23). Briefly, the packaging construct psPAX2 (AIDS Resource and Reagent Program),
luciferase reporter plasmid pLenti-CMV Puro-Luc (Addgene, USA), and spike protein
expressing pcDNA3.1- SARS CoV-2 SΔCT were co-transfected into HEK293T cells with
calcium phosphate. The supernatants containing the pseudotype viruses were collected
48 hrs post-transfection; pseudotype viruses were purified by filtration with 0.45 µm filter.
To determine the neutralization activity of the antisera from vaccinated animals,
HEK293T-hACE2 cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 1.75 x
104 cells/well overnight. Two-fold serial dilutions of heat inactivated serum samples were
prepared and mixed with 50 µL of pseudovirus. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 1
hr before adding to HEK293T-hACE2 cells. Forty-eight hrs after infection, cells were lysed
in Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers were defined as the sample dilution at
which a 50% reduction in relative light units (RLU) was observed relative to the average
of the virus control wells.

Statistical analysis. All measured values are reported as means ± standard deviation
(SD). Significant differences between groups were determined using Two-tailed Students
T-test with a two-sample unequal variance (heteroscedastic) parameter.

RESULTS
The facile manufacturing process of the MSR vaccines, and their plug-and-play nature
allowed vaccines to be fabricated and mice to be vaccinated within seven days of
obtaining the protein antigens.
MSR vaccines induce SARS-CoV-2 protein specific IgG responses. The anti-S1, S2
and RBD IgG responses resulting from vaccination with Group A1 (MSR, S1/S2/N, GMCSF, MPLA), Group B (MSR, RBD/S1/S2 1 µg, GM-CSF, MPLA), Group C (MSR,
RBD/S1/S2 5 µg, GM-CSF, MPLA), and D (MSR, RBD 1 µg, GM-CSF, MPLA) were first
quantified. All four of these groups were prepared by adding antigens to the MSR
vaccines during fabrication, lyophilizing and storing the vaccines, and subsequently
utilizing for vaccination. Negative controls in these studies included non-antigen
containing shams (MSR, GM-CSF, MPLA) as well as unvaccinated naïve mice.
Vaccination with Group A1 vaccines resulted in appreciable IgG levels by day 14, and
these levels continued to climb until plateauing at day 28 (Fig. 2A). The IgG levels
remained at a similar level for the duration of the study, even though these mice received
a boost at day 28. IgG levels in mice vaccinated with Groups B, C, and D vaccines
increased by two orders of magnitude over the sham control by day 14 (Fig. 2B), and by
day 28 were greater than or equal to 1 x 104 ng/ml; these levels were maintained for the
duration of the study. Strikingly, these mice only received a single vaccination at day 0,

with no subsequent boost. These results also demonstrated that a 5x vs 1x dose of
antigen (Group C vs Group B) induced only a slightly greater IgG response (Fig. 2B). The
incorporation of a single antigen (RBD; Group D) led to similar anti-RBD and -SI IgG
antibody responses as vaccines incorporating multiple antigens (Fig. 2B). Not
surprisingly, this vaccine did not induce any IgG response to S2, as the RBD is not part
of the S2 subunit of the S protein.

In addition to a standard, lyophilized vaccine configuration, an alternative method of
adding antigen to the MSR vaccine was explored. In this approach, the antigens are
added to shell vaccines (MSR, GM-CSF, MPLA) 30 minutes prior to immunization (Table
1 Group A2). This approach allows pre-manufacturing and storage of the vaccine, minus
antigen, and antigens that are identified can be readily incorporated at time of vaccination.
This vaccine configuration induced no measurable IgG response by day 14, and only
approximately one order of magnitude increases over the sham control by day 28 (Fig.
3). However, after boosting, this vaccine formulation induced similar levels of IgG to the
lyophilized vaccines (1 x 104 ng/ml) against RBD and S1, but an order of magnitude lower
response against S2 (Fig. 3). Similar to the lyophilized vaccine configuration, IgG levels
plateaued on day 42 and remained constant for the duration of the study.

(Table 2). Sera from Group A1 lyophilized vaccines demonstrated minimal activity at day
28, but by day 42 and 56 the median values of antibody neutralization titers were 557 and
656, respectively (Fig. 4A). By comparison, sera from Group B, C, and D vaccinated
animals conferred significant neutralization at day 28 (Fig. 4B). The 5x antigen dose
performed slightly better, generating more neutralizing activities than the 1x dose (Group
C vs Group B; median titer 445 vs 143). Sera from mice vaccinated with the RBD antigen
alone (Group D) also demonstrated substantial neutralization. Group A2 add-in-time
vaccines, which led to a slower induction of IgG responses than Group A1, were next
analyzed. These also lead to a slower increase in neutralization activity as at day 28 the
neutralization activity was less than that of the lyophilized vaccine (Group A1). However,
after boosting, the neutralization titers in sera on days 42 and 56 had similar values to
those from Group A1 (Fig. 5). It is worth noting however, that we did see more variability
with the add-in-time configuration of Group A2 vaccines, as compared to the premanufactured, lyophilized vaccines (Group A1).

DISCUSSION
The global COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated research aiming to discover safe and
effective vaccines against this pathogen, which likely will be needed to end the pandemic
(24). Several vaccines are already in clinical trials, but multiple vaccines will likely be
needed, and ones that can be easily and rapidly manufactured may be particularly useful
(25). To address this need, we leveraged our biomaterial vaccine technology that is based
on mesoporous silica. Synthetic amorphous silica is known to have good biocompatibility,
supporting its development as a versatile platform for clinical applications. Further, the

GM-CSF and MPLA used in the MSR vaccine have a track record of safe use in humans.
Local release of these agents from a biomaterial vaccine allows small quantities of these
agents to be used (e.g., 1 µg of GM-CSF per vaccine), minimizing concerns regarding
systemic side-effects or toxicity. The sustained presentation of antigen and adjuvant
made possible by the MSR vaccine, along with the accumulation of large numbers of
dendritic cells at the vaccine site, has been previously demonstrated to yield robust and
durable immune response in the context of oncology, as well as infectious diseases (1821, 26). One of the great benefits of this technology is that the modularity enables plugand-play versatility to quickly incorporate any antigen to manufacture and scale easily.
Here we utilized recombinant protein subunit vaccines, as they allow ready control over
epitopes and amount of antigen delivered, and the potential to fine-tune immune
responses with adjuvants.

The results of these studies demonstrate that adding SARS-CoV-2 antigens to shell
vaccines prior to immunization (add-in-time) induces robust humoral response, similar
over time as those obtained with pre-manufactured lyophilized MSR vaccines. This addin-time approach allows one to pre-manufacture shell vaccines (no antigen) in high
quantities, store, and simply add antigen when situations such as this pandemic occur,
and one requires a rapidly deployed vaccine. The kinetics of the IgG response were
slightly slower with the add-in-time version of the MSR vaccine, and this could be a result
of an insufficient times allowed for antigen adsorption prior to vaccination. Similar humoral
responses were found with the two antigen doses tested in this study, suggesting the
lower (1 µg) dose was already saturating.

Strong neutralizing responses were found in the sera of animals vaccinated with the
various MSR vaccines, as measured by a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus assay. The Group
A1 and A2 vaccines showed weaker activity before the boost on day 28, but strong activity
was found on days 42 and 56. In contrast, strong neutralization activity was found on day
28 for the Group B, C, and D vaccines. Since the differentiating factor between these
vaccines and Groups A1 and A2 was the addition of RBD in place of the N protein, we
hypothesize this led to more effective neutralization. This result supports the relevance of
the RBD in SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Analysis of sera obtained from vaccinated animals at
later time points will be tested in the future to provide a more in-depth analysis.

In summary, the data overall demonstrate the potential of the MSR vaccine to rapidly
generate potent and protective humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2.
