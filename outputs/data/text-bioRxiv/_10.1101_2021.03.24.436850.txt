Abstract: Global spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has triggered
unprecedented scientific efforts, as well as containment and treatment measures. Despite these efforts,
SARS-CoV-2 infections remain unmanageable in some parts of the world. Due to inherent mutability of
RNA viruses, it is not surprising that the SARS-CoV-2 genome has been continuously evolving since its
emergence. Recently, four functionally distinct variants, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and CAL.20C, have been
identified, and they appear to more infectious and transmissible than the original (Wuhan-Hu-1) virus.
Here we provide evidence based upon a combination of bioinformatics and structural approaches that can
explain the higher infectivity of the new variants. Our results show that the greater infectivity of SARSCoV-2 than SARS-CoV can be attributed to a combination of several factors, including alternate receptors.
Additionally, we show that new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged in the background of D614G in Spike
protein and P323L in RNA polymerase. The correlation analyses showed that all mutations in specific
variants did not evolve simultaneously. Instead, some mutations evolved most likely to compensate for the
viral fitness.

1. Introduction

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), is the seventh human coronavirus (hCoV) discovered to date. The
other six are hCoV-229E, hCoV-NL63, hCoV-HKU1, hCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS) CoV. Four CoVs (hCoV-229E, hCoV-NL63, hCoV-HKU1 and hCoV-OC43) typically
cause mild self-limiting cold-like diseases. However, three CoVs (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV2) cause fatal respiratory illness. CoVs are single-stranded, non-segmented positive (+)-sense RNA viruses
of ~30 kb genome length. They encode up to 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) and 10-12 structural/accessory
proteins [1,2]. The nsps form the replication/transcription complex (RTC) that synthesizes the nascent (-)
strand RNA to be used as a template for (+) sense genome and a set of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNA) with
common 5’-leader sequence and a 3’-poly-A tail. Of the 10-12 structural proteins, there are four major
proteins: spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E) that participate in the infection and
assembly of infectious progeny virus [3,4].

In the first step of viral infection, the spike (S) protein of hCoVs directly interacts with distinct host cell
receptors, where angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as the cell-surface receptor for SARS-CoV
and SARS-CoV-2. The synergistic action of host cell serine protease TMPRSS2 to the ACE2/spike interaction
cleaves S protein into S1 and S2 subunits to facilitate endocytosis of viral particle [5]. Due to its primary
role in hCoV infections, S protein is a crucial target for developing vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and
diagnostics [6]. Structural data show that the receptor-binding domains (RBDs) within the S1 subunits of
both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have largely conserved interactions with the ACE2, despite being the
domain of lowest homology between the two viruses [7-10].

Owing to the critical role of the RBD in SARS-CoV-2 infection, almost all vaccines in development
target the RBD. Since currently approved vaccines are based on the RBD sequence of the first isolated virus

(Wuhan-Hu-1; GenBank accession no. NC_045512), newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants containing
mutations within the RBD may present a challenge to vaccination efforts. Here, we present the results of
our analyses and show that the combination of three mutations D614G, P323L and C241U are limited to
the U. S., and the major SARS-CoV-2 variants (B.1.1.7, the UK variant; B.1.351, the South Africa variant; P.1,
the Brazil variant and CAL.20C, the California variant) emerged independently. We then mapped the
mutations onto the tertiary and quaternary structural data to evaluate the factors that may be responsible
for the apparent enhanced infectivity of the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our results show that
(i) N501Y, the most common mutation among all variants, forms a π-π interaction with Y44 of ACE2 that
may enhance the binding affinity of S protein with ACE2 and (ii) the mutations in the virus change the
conformational entropy of the S protein and thereby its stability. We also show that mutations near these
sites may enhance the propensity of virus interaction with certain integrins, presumably
alternate/additional receptors of the SARS-CoV-2.

2. Results
2.1. A comparison of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins interaction with ACE2

Three CoVs (hCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) use ACE2 as a host cell receptor. The S protein
RBDs (S-RBDs) and ACE2 complex have been solved [9-14], which show that the S-RBDs of SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 share structural homology, whereas the S-RBD of hCoV-NL63 is structurally distinct.
Nonetheless, the S-RBDs of the three CoVs bind to overlapping sites on ACE2 [11]. To date, three crystal
structures [9,12,13] and one cryoEM structure of the S-RBD/ACE2 complex [14] have been reported, as well
as a series of cryoEM structures representing different conformations and stoichiometries of the S
protein/ACE2 complexes [15]. Two crystal structures of the S protein/ACE2 complexes contain S-RBDs that
are identical to the S-RBD of the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate [9,12], whereas the third crystal structure contains
RBD modifications at ~20 sites [13] (Fig. 1a). Although some of these modifications (V417K and N439R) are

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.24.436850; this version posted March 24, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

at the S-RBD/ACE2 interface, they do not appear to affect overall binding interactions as noted in other SRBD/ACE2 complexes. The cryoEM structure complexes containing one S protein and one, two or three
ACE2 proteins provide a great deal of atomic details of spike/ACE2 interactions and suggest that more than
one ACE2 can bind to the trimer of the S protein. This is the first report suggesting a higher-order
interaction between the two proteins [15]. A total of 14 RBD residues of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
interact with ACE2 (Fig. 1a, red/pink-shaded columns) [16]. Overall, there exists ~76% homology between
S proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The most variable region of S protein is the RBD, and the most
variable region within the RBD is the receptor-binding motif (RBM) (Fig. 1a; green-shaded regions). Despite
these variations, 8 out of 14 residues are topologically conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
(red-shaded residues in Fig. 1a) and the remaining 6 residues form chemically similar interactions. Notably,
the structural comparison does not reveal dramatic differences in S-RBD residue interactions with ACE2
that can explain the greater binding affinity for ACE2 of the S-RBD of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARSCoV.

Several structural studies also experimentally determined the binding affinity between S-RBD and
ACE2. Using Biolayer Interferometry (BLI), Walls et al. showed that S-RBD of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2
with nearly a 4-fold greater affinity than S-RBD of SARS-CoV [16]. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
measurements have shown an ~4-fold [13] to ~20-fold [8] greater binding affinity of ACE2 with SARS-CoV2 S-RBD compared to SARS-CoV S-RBD. In contrast, little difference between the binding affinities of
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD for ACE2 was reported elsewhere [9]. Therefore, it remains unclear if
differences in the binding affinities of S-RBDs for ACE2 are responsible for the greater infectivity of SARSCoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV. Thus, we explored alternative mechanisms to explain the higher infectivity
of SARS-CoV-2, focusing on the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 entry after S protein binding to ACE2.

2.2. Alternate SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.24.436850; this version posted March 24, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

A notable difference between SARS-CoV-2 and other human CoVs is the presence of a conserved ArgGly-Asp (RGD) motif (403- 405) in the S-RBD [17]. The same position in SARS-CoV S-RBD is occupied by
a Lys-Gly-Asp (KGD) motif that is functionally related to an RGD motif (Fig. 1a, orange-shaded region)
[18]. In the family of ~20 heterodimeric integrin molecules, 9 RGD-binding integrins can directly interact
with RGD motifs of extracellular matrix proteins to promote normal tissue morphology and regulate
physiological functions cell adhesion and migration [19,20]. RGD-binding integrins, when activated by
RGD-containing ligands, are also able to modulate outside-in signaling under a wide variety of conditions
[19,21-23]. Integrins are known to be utilized by certain viruses to bind the host cells [24]. Thus, several
human viruses, including metapneumonovirus [25], human cytomegalovirus [26] and adenovirus types 2
and 5 [27] use RGD motifs for attachment to RGD-binding integrins. An examination of the structures of
SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 complexes indicates that the RGD motif in the S-RBD does not directly interact
with ACE2, despite its location near the middle of the S-RBD/ACE2 interface, suggesting an alternate role
for the RGD motif of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD. It is postulated that RGD-binding integrins recognize the
RGD motif of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and that these integrins [28] could serve as an alternate SARS-CoV-2
receptor or as a co-receptor together with ACE2, thereby contributing to the higher infectivity of SARSCoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV.

ACE2 also contains both RGD (203-205) and KGD (353-355) motifs and has been shown to bind
integrins and modulate outside-in signaling [29]. RGD 203-205 is distal to the bound S-RBD of SARS-CoV2 and is near the active site cleft formed by two domains of ACE2 and, therefore it should not be accessible
for protein-protein interaction. Indeed, ACE2 interaction with α5β1 integrins was found to be independent
of this RGD motif. However, the KGD 353-355 motif of ACE2 is localized at the S-RBD interface (Fig. 1b),
recognized by RGD-binding integrins [18], and mutation in this motif strongly inhibits binding of SARSCoV S protein [30]. Residues R403 of the RGD motif in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 (KGD in SARS-CoV)
and K353 of the KGD motif of ACE2 are oriented in such a way that they sandwich Y505 of SARS-CoV-2

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.24.436850; this version posted March 24, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

S-RBD (Y491 for SARS-CoV) (Fig. 1b), which in turn forms conserved interactions with E37 and R393 of
ACE2 (not shown). Additionally, the RGD motif of S-RBD in SARS-CoV-2 and the KGD motif of SARSCoV as well as the KGD motif in ACE2 appear to be strategically positioned near Y41 of ACE2, which
interacts with N501 and T500 of SARS-CoV-2 or T487 and T486 of SARS-CoV (Fig. 1b). Taken together, this
analysis implies that SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV may have evolved an S protein RGD/KGD motif that
enhances association with host cells through RGD-binding integrins to optimize cell entry of SARSCoV/ACE2 complexes.

2.3. Binding of two S protein trimers to the ACE2 dimer

A cryoEM structure of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD, ACE2 and sodium-dependent neutral amino acid
transporter B0AT1 (SLC6A19) showed that ACE2 in the dimeric form interacts with SLC6A19, and two
SARS-CoV-2 S-RBDs bind to the ACE2 dimer [14]. For functional expression on the cell surface, SLC6A19
requires an obligatory subunit, collectrin (TMEM27) in the kidney and ACE2 in the intestine [31-34]. The
binding interface for the two S-RBDs on ACE2 is the same as reported for the crystal structures, as
mentioned earlier. However, this report suggests that two S protein trimers can bind to the ACE2 dimer
(Fig. 1c) when bound to B0AT1, thereby increasing the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. However, the structure
of the SARS-CoV S-RBD/B0AT1/ACE2 complex is not known and it remains to be seen whether these S
protein trimers can enhance the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2.

2.4. Geo-prevalence of re-emerging SARS-CoV-2

Several new SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged over the past few months. The four major variants
are characterized by a set of mutations in the S protein, and a few mutations in different ORFs
(Supplementary Text ). A list of the mutations in the four major variants is given in Table 1. To understand
if SARS-CoV-2 S proteins containing these mutations (Table 1) vary regionally or co-exist in different

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.24.436850; this version posted March 24, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

variants, we analyzed sequences (n = 7, 232) from different regions: Brazil (n = 119), California (n = 1,683),
South Africa (n = 129) and the United Kingdom (n = 5,301). The results presented in Fig. 2 show that the S
protein mutations among new variants are limited almost exclusively to specific variants and geographic
locations. There are only two exceptions. D614G is present universally at high (~100%) prevalence and
N501Y is present in P.1, CAL.20C, B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 at 56, 6, 99 and 83% frequencies, respectively (Fig. 2).
The low prevalence of common mutations among different variants also suggests that these variants have
evolved independently. All regions also had other mutations in addition to their respective variant’s
signature mutations. For example, the CAL.20C variant is characterized by four mutations (S13I, W152C,
L452R, D614G). However, mutations P26S, N501Y, A570D, P681H, S982A and D1118H were significantly
prevalent (up to 9%) in California. Additionally, the V1176F mutation, which has not been included as a
signature mutation of the P.1 variant, was present at a very high frequency (~81%). It is worth mentioning
here that the N501Y mutation that is a signature mutation of the UK (B.1.17), Brazil (P.1) and SA (B.1.351)
variants is significantly less prevalent (~6%) in the CAL.20C variant. The data presented in Fig. 2 also
indicate the prevalence of different variants in the USA (except CAL.20C, discussed in Section 2.7). Thus,
considering that P681H is a signature mutation of B.1.1.7, nearly 9% of infections in the USA (i.e. CAL.20C)
may be related to B.1.1.7 (Fig. 2).

2.5. Relative abundance of mutations in different variants

To find out the relative abundance of specific mutations within a given variant and with respect to
previously reported three co-existing mutations (D614G, P323L and C241U) in the United States [35], we
analyzed a significantly larger number of sequences (n = 225,368) that included UK (207,088), South Africa
(3,273), Brazil (2,541) and California (12,466). Of these, 47,078 (~23%) sequences from the UK are B.1.1.7, 590
(~18%) in South Africa are B.1.351, 61 (~2%) in Brazil are P.1, and 1,212 (~10%) in the United States are
CAL.20C (as of Feb. 6, 2021). All sequences included in this study have the D614G mutation in the S protein.

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.24.436850; this version posted March 24, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

The results of this analysis are shown in Supplementary Figure 1. This figure confirms our two previous
observations: (i) three mutations (D614G, P323L and C241U) co-exist in the United States [35], and (ii)
variant-specific mutations evolved independently (as concluded from a smaller dataset Fig. 2). The analysis
of a large number of sequences revealed that all variants had additional mutations than the reported
signature mutations from these variants. For example, the prevalence of P681H was 14% in P.1 and 9% in
CAL.20C (Fig. 2). In addition, the V1176F mutation at a prevalence of 81% co-exists with signature mutation
E484K in P.1 (Fig. 2).

2.6. Correlation among variant-specific mutations

To determine the correlation among variant-specific mutations, we conducted a correlation analysis
that included mutations P323L and C241U in addition to the mutations in the S protein. The results
presented in Fig. 3a-d show that D614G and P323L are highly correlated independent of geographical
location in all variants. However, a strong correlation among three mutations (D614G, P323L and C241U)
was seen only in the U. S. infections, suggesting that the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the U. S. has been different
from the ones in the UK, Brazil and South Africa.

To determine the correlation among variant-specific mutations in S protein, we excluded the P323L
and C241U mutations. Thus, B.1.1.7 mutations are strongly correlated with D614G except for T716I (Fig.
3e), which is negatively correlated (-0.3), suggesting that T716I most likely evolved separately in the
background of (D614G, P681H, N501Y, S982A, A570D and D1118H). We also included mutation A626T in
our analyses as it is significantly prevalent in the UK viruses (75%) (Supplementary Fig. S1) that also
contained P323L (Fig. 3a).

The CAL.20C (Fig. 3b) variant has two distinct groups of correlated mutations. The first group includes
D614G, P323L and C241U (Fig. 3b), confirming our previous results [35]. The second group of correlated

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.24.436850; this version posted March 24, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

mutations includes S13I, W152C and L452R (Fig. 3b). The CAL.20C variant has four signature mutations
(S13I, W152C, L452R and D614G) in the S protein (Table 1 and Fig. 2). To determine the correlation among
the S protein mutations of CAL.20C, we excluded P323L and C241U mutations from the correlation
analyses. The results in Fig. 3f clearly show that all four S protein mutations are strongly correlated. We
also included additional S protein mutations in our analyses based on data presented in Fig. 2. The results
show a positive correlation of N501Y with D614G, suggesting that these mutations coexist in some viruses
in the United States. It is possible that another variant in the U. S. may emerge that includes D614G and
N501Y mutations.

As expected, all the mutations in B.1.351 (SA variant) are correlated except D614G, which clustered
with P323L (Fig. 3c). To gain insight into the correlation among S protein mutations, we re-analyzed the
SA sequences after excluding P323L and C241U mutations. The correlation analysis presented in Fig. 3g
reveals that mutations in the S protein of the B.1.351 variant are positively correlated except for D614G and
R246I, which are clustered together. These results indicate a complex evolution of the mutations in B.1.351
S protein. Considering that a majority of viruses contain D614G, it appears that R246I emerged separately
than other B.1.351 mutations.

The correlation analysis of the mutations in the P.1 (Brazil) variant is extremely complex (Fig. 3d). There
are at least 6 groups of correlated mutations. While D614G and P323L are positively correlated, C241U does
not cluster with D614G and P323L. Instead, C241U shows a positive correlation with N501Y. To better
understand the correlation of mutations in the S protein of P.1, we excluded P323L and C241U and reanalyzed the correlation of mutations (Fig. 3h). There are two major groups of positively correlated
mutations. The first group includes D614G, N501Y, L18F, D138Y and K417T, whereas the second group of
correlated mutations includes T20N, P26S, R190S and T1027I. Additionally, the V1176F mutation is

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.24.436850; this version posted March 24, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

positively correlated with R190S. Considering that V1176F is not a signature mutation in the P.1 variant, a
different and probably more complex variant may emerge from P.1.

2.7. Prevalence of CAL.20C in different states of the United States

We used signature mutations of CAL.20C to map the prevalence of this variant in the United States. As
of Feb. 24, 2021, 36 states in the U. S. had CAL.20C infections. A map of the CAL.20C distribution in the
USA is shown in Fig. 4. Since no sequences from South Dakota have been deposited, it was not possible to
determine the prevalence of CAL.20C there. Specific details of mutation prevalence of four signature S
protein mutations in CAL.20C are shown in Supplementary Figure 2.

It is evident that California had the maximum prevalence of CAL.20C (32%) followed by Oregon (25%)
> South Carolina (19%) > North Dakota = District of Columbia (17%) > Arizona = Mississippi (15%) > New
Mexico (12%) > Washington (10%). The close prevalence of CAL.20C in California and Oregon is not
surprising as this variant can easily migrate between these states. However, a 19% prevalence in South
Carolina suggests that the virus has migrated directly or through intermediate source from CA to SC during
the early emergence of CAL.20C. To our surprise, we did not find CAL.20C mutations from the sequences
submitted by Nevada (except D614G). Additionally, a search of GSAID repository showed that the four S
protein mutations in that belong to CAL.20C were present in California as early as early July, 2020 (GSAID
# hCoV-19/USA/CA-LACPHL-AE00055/2020|EPI_ISL_765994|2020-07-07) [36]. Therefore, the evolution of
CAL.20C and its temporal distribution among different states in the U. S. appears rather complex
warranting in-depth study.

2.8. Structural implications of variant-specific mutations

We used the crystal structure of ACE2/S-RBD (PDB file 6M0J) [9] to understand if the mutations in the
S-RBD are topologically positioned such that they enhance the binding of S protein to ACE2. While the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.24.436850; this version posted March 24, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

effect of some mutations can be directly extrapolated to increased binding, the reported structures of either
S protein or the S-RBD/ACE2 complex do not provide direct evidence for the enhanced binding affinity of
S protein to the ACE2 receptor. Thus, the signature mutation N501Y, which is present in three of the four
variants, forms a hydrophobic interaction between Y501 with Y41 of ACE2 and Y449 of RBD (Fig. 5a) that
is absent in the case of N501. However, a rationale for greater infectivity of variants with L452R is not
obvious from the structural analysis of the reported ACE2/S-RBD complexes. As shown in Fig. 5b, L452
does not interact with ACE2, and the mutation R452 in the S-RBD remains too distant to interact with ACE2.

To gain additional insight, we calculated the change in free energy (∆∆G) between the wild-type and
mutant protein as described by Pandurangan et al. [37]. The calculated ∆∆G values for a majority of the
signature mutations is shown in Fig. 6. A positive value of ∆∆G indicates an increase in protein stability,
whereas a negative ∆∆G indicates a decrease in protein stability. Evidently, D614G (the globally dominant
virus variant) has the highest ∆∆G, suggesting that 614G S protein is more stable than 614D S protein.
K417N, part of the B.1.351 variant, has the lowest ∆∆G, which indicates a decrease in the protein stability.
While the computation of ∆∆G does not provide a definitive answer regarding the overall stability of S
protein, it does indicate an increased stability of S protein with specific mutations.
3. Summary and Conclusion

Here we present the analyses of factors that may play a role in the higher infectivity of SARS-CoV-2
compared to SARS-CoV. Additionally, we present in-depth analyses of mutations and their prevalence in
new SARS-CoV-2 variants that are presumably more infectious than the original (Wuhan-Hu-1) virus
(GenBank accession # NC_045512).

The extent of genetic variation between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 varies depending upon where
they circulate in the world. Thus, the nsp coding regions and S protein-coding regions of the two viruses

share ~86% and 76% homology, respectively [38]. The least homologous region in the S protein is the RBM
(Fig. 1a). However, many amino acid residues within the RBM that participate in ACE2 binding are
conserved, and there are only subtle differences in the interaction patterns of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
S-RBDs. Hence, it is not likely that binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 is the sole determinant
influencing infectivity, suggesting that RGD-binding integrin recognition by the RGD motif in the S protein
of SARS-CoV-2 may act as an alternate receptor or a co-receptor with ACE2 to enhance viral entry into the
host cell. It has been suggested that integrins can bind ACE2 in RGD-dependent and RGD-independent
manners, suggesting that ACE2/integrin complexes may provide increased binding opportunities for
SARS-CoV-2 with the host cell. Furthermore, integrins present on the cell surface in at least three different
conformations: 1) bent, 2) extended conformation with a closed headpiece, and 3) an extended
conformation with an open headpiece. These different forms are known to influence the binding of the
integrin to its cognate ligands. Because integrins are involved in the recruitment and retention of cells
within the inflamed tissues [20,28,39], such as during viral infection, blocking or targeting integrins and the
SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain may reduce SARS-COV-2 mediated inflammation or severity of disease, which
needs to be further explored in future studies. An unanswered question is compared to the RGD motif in
SARS-CoV-2 why do the same ACE2/integrin complexes not confer high SARS-CoV infectivity based upon
the presence of the KGD motif? One possibility is that RGD may be recognized by a more significant
number of RGD-binding integrins than the KGD motif [40].

Based on the analyses of available sequences of regions of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, it is obvious that
these variants have evolved independently. Our correlation analyses of variant-specific mutations also
show that the mutations in a given variant may not have evolved simultaneously. As with all RNA viruses,
a (resultant) evolved virus goes through quasispecies [41] in which the viral populations consist of mutant
spectra (or mutant clouds) rather than genomes with the same nucleotide sequence. It is possible that SARSCoV-2 genomic sequences rapidly expand in sequence space and lose biological information that enables

the elimination of fitness compromised genomes. Subsequent mutations or mutant spectra in the
quasispecies of SARS-CoV-2 are most likely generated to circumvent reduced viral fitness for adaptability.
This is because the quasispecies mutations constitute dynamic (continuously changing) repositories of
genotypic and phenotypic viral variants [41].

From currently available structural, genetic and biochemical data, the higher infectivity of SARS-CoV2 vs. SARS-CoV is not fully understood, at least in the context of SARS-CoV-2 entry. It would be ideal if a
single, relatively discrete host/pathogen interface was primarily responsible for conferring infectivity from
a therapeutic perspective. However, our structural studies suggest that it is highly likely that this process
is more complex and nuanced. Additional structural information, clinical studies, and a more thorough
understanding of the viral life cycle will likely reveal novel biological information and, in turn, illuminate
potential therapeutic targets to disrupt SARS-CoV-2 entry.

4. Material and Methods.

The prevalence of each mutation, in Brazil, California, South Africa and the United Kingdom were
determined from the GISAID repository [36]. These sequences were aligned using the MAFFT [42], MEGA
[43] or JalView [44] sequence alignment programs. The sequences were then analyzed through in-house
Python or R scripts. Relative abundance (RA) of mutations in S protein from different geographic regions
was determined by an in-house python script using the scikit-learn (Python) library [45] and plotted with
R (codes available upon request). Final values were multiplied by 100 to express as a percent. For the
correlation analyses, an R package ‘ggcorrplot’ was used in an in-house R script. The prevalence of
CAL.20C within the United States was computed by an in-house Python script. All in-house scripts are
available upon request. The structural analyses were conducted using the Schrodinger Suite (Schrodinger
LLC, NY) and PyMol [46]. The free energy change upon mutation in S protein (∆∆G) was computed
through SDM server as detailed by Pandurangan et al. [37].

Figure 2. Geo-prevalence of mutations within S protein of four variants. Additional mutations were added
to this figure after we noted that these mutations were not reported previously for these variants. For
example, the CAL.20C variant has been characterized by S13I, W152C, L452R and D614G mutations.
However, we noted additional mutations in this variant (e. g. P681H ~ 9%). Also, previous characterization
of the P.1 variant did not include V1176F. Our results showed this mutation was at high prevalence (~81%).
Therefore, this mutation is included in the figure.

mutations in S protein together with D614G, P323L and C241U(T) from B.1.1.7, CAL.20C, B.1.351 and P.1
variants, respectively. Panels e, f, g and h show the correlation analyses of mutations in S protein from
B.1.1.7, CAL.20C, B.1.351, and P.1 variants, respectively. Some additional mutations, V1176F in P.1 and

N501Y, E484K and K417N in CAL.20C, were included in our analyses as these mutations were significantly
prevalent in respective variants.
