Key words: SARS-CoV-2; in-cell ELISA; antiviral testing; neutralization; drug screening
Highlights:
 Determination of SARS-CoV-2 infection by enzymatically quantifying the expression of viral
spike protein in bulk cell cultures
 Targeting a highly conserved region in the S2 subunit of the S protein allows broad detection of
several SARS-CoV-2 isolates in different cell lines
 Screening of antivirals in microtiter format and determining the antiviral activity as inhibitory
concentrations 50 (IC50)
Abstract:
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel pandemic coronavirus that caused a global health and economic crisis. The
development of efficient drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 requires detailed knowledge about SARSCoV-2 biology. Several techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection have been established, mainly based
on counting infected cells by staining plaques or foci, or by quantifying the viral genome by PCR. These
methods are laborious, time-consuming and expensive and therefore not suitable for a high sample
throughput or rapid diagnostics. We here report a novel enzyme-based immunodetection assay that directly
quantifies the amount of de novo synthesized viral spike protein within fixed and permeabilized cells. This
in-cell ELISA enables a rapid and quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in microtiter format,
regardless of the virus isolate or target cell culture. It follows the established method of performing ELISA
assays and does not require expensive instrumentation. Utilization of the in-cell ELISA allows to e.g.
determine TCID50 of virus stocks, antiviral efficiencies (IC50 values) of drugs or neutralizing activity of sera.
Thus, the in-cell spike ELISA represents a promising alternative to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and
inhibition and may facilitate future research.

Introduction:
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged as a novel human pathogen
at the end of 2019 and spread around the globe within three months. It causes the coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) that if symptomatic manifests as fever, cough, and shortness of breath, and can progress to
pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome resulting in septic shock, multi-organ failure and death. As
of end of May 2020, more than 376,000 deaths worldwide occurred upon SARS-CoV-2 infection which
forced governments to implement strict measures of social distancing to limit the spread of the virus but
greatly impacted individual freedom and economy. Due to its high transmissibility, without such harsh
interventions its pandemic spread is unlikely to be stopped without the cost of a substantial death toll.
Therefore, the development of prophylactics or therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 is imperative.

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with diameters of 60-140 nanometers (Zhu et
al., 2020). Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, the S (spike), E (envelope),
M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins. The S protein is responsible for allowing the virus to attach
to and fuse with the membrane of a host cell. It is primed by the transmembrane serine protease 2
(TMPRSS2) resulting in interactions of the S1 subunit with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
and rearrangements in S2 to form a six-helix bundle structure that triggers fusion of the viral with the cellular
membrane (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Q. Wang et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020a, 2020b). Compounds interfering
with the binding of the S protein to ACE2 (Ou et al., 2020; C. Wang et al., 2020) or inhibiting TMPRSS2
or formation of the six-helix bundle also suppress infection by SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Xia et
al., 2020a, 2020b). SARS-CoV-2 is now intensely investigated to understand viral biology and pathogenesis
and to develop antiviral drugs and vaccines. Techniques to study and quantify SARS-CoV-2 infection and
replication in cell culture have quickly evolved in the past months, partially inspired by methods developed
for the related SARS-CoV or other (corona-) viruses.

SARS-CoV-2 infection is mainly quantified by determining the number of infectious particles by counting
virus-induced plaques or foci after staining with crystal violet, neutral red (Keil et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020;
Runfeng et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020a) or specific antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 antigens, e.g. against the N
protein (Chu et al., 2020; X. Liu et al., 2020). These antibodies are either labelled directly with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) or fluorophores, or are detected by a corresponding secondary labelled antibody. The
number of infected cells is then detected by immunofluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, or by manual
counting by microscope or with the help of computational algorithms (J. Liu et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020;
Ou et al., 2020; Runfeng et al., 2020). Other methods to quantify infection rates are detection of cellassociated RNA by RT-qPCR (Monteil et al., 2020; Runfeng et al., 2020) or viral proteins by western
blotting (Ou et al., 2020), which are expensive and unsuitable for large sample numbers. Alternatively, with
prolonged waiting times until results are available, viral replication may be measured by determining the
RNA or infectious titers of progeny virus released from infected cells by RT-qPCR (Chu et al., 2020; J. Liu
et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020), or tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) endpoint titrations (Chin et al.,
2020; Manenti et al., 2020) and plaque assays (Keil et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020; Runfeng et al., 2020; Xia
et al., 2020a), respectively. All these assays are well established and validated but have the downside of
being laborious, time-consuming, lacking specificity, and the difficulty to increase sample sizes to perform
analysis in microtiter format which is substantial in the search for antivirals or in diagnostics. Instead of
counting infected cells or quantifying RNA, we here developed an in-cell ELISA that directly quantifies
SARS-CoV-2 infection by detecting newly synthesized S protein. The assay allows detection of all SARSCoV-2 isolates tested and can be easily performed in any format including 96-well plates. It can be used to
measure the TCID50, to screen for antivirals, and to determine antiviral potencies of drugs (as inhibitory
concentration 50), neutralizing sera or antibodies in a timely and cost-effective manner, within only two
days.

Cell culture. Vero E6 (Cercopithecus aethiops derived epithelial kidney) cells were grown in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco) which was supplemented with 2.5% heat-inactivated fetal calf
serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate,
and 1x non-essential amino acids. Caco-2 (human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma) cells were grown
in the same media but with supplementation of 10% FCS. Calu-3 (human epithelial lung adenocarcinoma)
cells were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEM, Sigma #M4655) supplemented with 10%
FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 1x non-essential amino
acids. All cells were grown at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator.

Virus strains and virus propagation. Viral isolate BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020 (#014V-03890) and
BetaCoV/Netherlands/01/NL/2020 (#010V-03903) were obtained through the European Virus Archive
global. Virus was propagated by inoculation of 70% confluent Vero E6 in 75 cm² cell culture flasks with
100 µl SARS-CoV-2 isolates in 3.5 ml serum-free medium containing 1 µg/ml trypsin. Cells were incubated
for 2 h at 37°C, before adding 20 ml medium containing 15 mM HEPES. Cells were incubated at 37°C and
supernatant harvested at day 3 post inoculation when a strong cytopathic effect (CPE) was visible.
Supernatants were centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 × g to remove cellular debris, and then aliquoted and stored
at -80°C as virus stocks. Infectious virus titer was determined as plaque forming units or TCID50.

Virus isolation from patient samples. To isolate SARS-CoV-2 from patient samples, 50,000 Vero E6 cells
were seeded in 24-well plates in 500 µl medium incubated over night at 37°C. The next day, medium was
replaced by 400 µl of 2.5 µg/ml amphotericin B containing medium. Then, 100 µl of throat swabs that were
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by qRT-PCR were titrated 5-fold on the cells and incubated for 3 to 5 days.
Upon visible CPE, supernatant was taken and virus expanded by inoculation of Vero E6 cell in 75 cm² flasks
and propagated as above described, resulting in the two viral isolates BetaCoV/Germany/Ulm/01/2020 and
BetaCoV/Germany/Ulm/02/2020.

Plaque assay. To determine plaque forming units (PFU), SARS-CoV-2 stocks were serially diluted 10-fold
and used to inoculate Vero E6 cells. To this end, 800,000 Vero E6 cells were seeded per 12 well in 1 ml
medium and cultured overnight to result in a 100% confluent cell monolayer. Medium was removed, cells
were washed once with PBS and 400 µl PBS were added. Cells were then inoculated with 100 µl of titrated
SARS-CoV-2 and incubated for 1 to 3 h at 37°C with shaking every 15 to 30 min. Next, cells were overlayed
with 1.5 ml of 0.8% Avicel RC-581 (FMC Corporation) in medium and incubated for 3 days. Cells were
fixed by adding 1 ml 8% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and incubation at room temperature for 45 min.
Supernatant was discarded, cells were washed with PBS once, and 0.5 ml of staining solution (0.5% crystal
violet and 0.1% triton in water) was added. After 20 min incubation at room temperature, the staining
solution was washed off with water, virus-induced plaques were counted, and PFU per ml calculated. Based
on the applied PFU per cell the MOIs were calculated.

TCID50 endpoint titration. To determine the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50), SARS-CoV-2
stocks were serially diluted 10-fold and used to inoculate Vero E6 or Caco-2 cells. To this end, 6,000 Vero
E6 or 10,000 Caco-2 cells were seeded per well in 96 flat bottom well plates in 100 µl medium and incubated
over night before 62 µl fresh medium was added. Next, 18 µl of titrated SARS-CoV-2 of each dilution was
used for inoculation, resulting in final SARS-CoV-2 dilutions of 1:101 to 1:109 on the cells in sextuplicates.
Cells were then incubated for 5 days and monitored for CPE. TCID50/ml was calculated according to Reed
and Muench.

Establishment of the in-cell SARS-CoV-2 ELISA. To establish detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection,
6,000 Vero E6 or 10,000 Caco-2 target cells were seeded in 96 well plates in 100 µl. The next day, 62 µl

fresh medium was added and the cells were inoculated with 18 µl of a 10-fold titration series of SARSCoV-2. One to three days later, SARS-CoV-2 S protein staining was assessed using an anti-SARS-CoV-2
S protein antibody. To this end, cells were fixed by adding 180 µl 8% PFA and 30 min of room temperature
incubation. Medium was then discarded and the cells permeabilized for 5 min at room temperature by adding
100 µl of 0.1% Triton in PBS. Cells were then washed with PBS and stained with 1:1,000, 1:5,000 or
1:10,000 diluted mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein antibody 1A9 (Biozol GTX-GTX632604) in antibody
buffer (PBS containing 10% (v/v) FCS and 0.3% (v/v) Tween 20) at 37°C. After one hour, the cells were
washed three times with washing buffer (0.3% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS) before a secondary anti-mouse or
anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with HRP was added (1:10,000, 1:15,000, 1:20,000 or 1:30,000) and
incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Following four times of washing, the 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)
peroxidase substrate (Medac #52-00-04) was added. After 5 min light-protected incubation at room
temperature, reaction was stopped using 0.5 M H2SO4. The optical density (OD) was recorded at 450 nm
and baseline corrected for 620 nm using the Asys Expert 96 UV microplate reader (Biochrom).

SARS-CoV-2 infection and inhibition assay. This is the final protocol established during this study and
applied to analyze SARS-CoV-2 infection and inhibition. To determine SARS-CoV-2 infection, 12,000 Vero
E6 or 30,000 Caco-2 target cells were seeded in 96 well plates in 100 µl. The next day, fresh medium and
the respective compound of interest (chloroquine (Sigma-Aldrich #C6628); lopinavir (Selleck Chemicals
#S1380); EK1 (Core Facility Functional Peptidomics, Ulm); remdesivir (Selleck Chemicals #S8932)) was
added and the cells inoculated with the desired multiplicity of infection (MOI; based on PFU per cell) of
SARS-CoV-2 in a total volume of 180 µl. Alternatively, virus was preincubated with the compound (human
(Sigma-Aldrich #L8402) or chicken (Sigma-Aldrich #L4919) lysozyme) and the mix used for inoculation.
Two days later, infection was quantified by detecting SARS-CoV-2 S protein. To this end, cells were fixed
by adding 180 µl 8% PFA and 30 min of room temperature incubation. Medium was then discarded and
cells permeabilized for 5 min at room temperature by adding 100 µl of 0.1% Triton in PBS. Cells were then
washed with PBS and stained with 1:5,000 diluted mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein antibody 1A9 (Biozol
GTX-GTX632604) in antibody buffer (PBS containing 10% (v/v) FCS and 0.3% (v/v) Tween 20) at 37°C.
After one hour, the cells were washed three times with washing buffer (0.3% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS) before
a secondary anti-mouse antibody conjugated with HRP (Thermo Fisher #A16066) was added (1:15,000)
and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Following four times of washing, the TMB peroxidase substrate (Medac #5200-04) was added. After 5 min light-protected incubation at room temperature, reaction was stopped using
0.5 M H2SO4. The optical density (OD) was recorded at 450 nm and baseline corrected for 620 nm using
the Asys Expert 96 UV microplate reader (Biochrom). Values were corrected for the background signal
derived from uninfected cells and untreated controls were set to 100% infection.

SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. Sera was obtained before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak or from
convalescent COVID-19 patients (confirmed by symptoms and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR from
nasopharyngeal swabs) tested for seroconversion by IgG/IgA ELISA (Euroimmun #EI 2606-9601 G/ #EI
2606-9601 A) according to the manufacturers’ instructions and IgG/IgM chemiluminescent immunoassay
(Shenzhen New Industries Biomedical Engineering, #130219015M/ #130219016M) performed fullyautomated in a Maglumi 800. To quantify neutralizing activity of the sera, 30,000 Caco-2 target cells were
seeded in 96 well plates in 100 µl and the next day 62 µl fresh medium was added. The sera were heatinactivated (30 min at 56°C), titrated 2-fold starting with a 5-fold dilution, and mixed 1:1 with SARS-CoV2 France/IDF0372/2020. After 90 min incubation at room temperature, the mix was used to infect the cells
with 18 µl in triplicates at a MOI of 0.01. Two days later, SARS-CoV-2 S protein expression was quantified
as described above.

At day 4 cells were then fixed (8% PFA), permeabilized (0.1% Triton), stained (1:5,000 1A9; 1:15,000 antimouse-HRP), visualized (TMB) and detected in a microplate reader as described above. Infected wells were
defined as having a higher signal than the uninfected control plus three times the standard deviation.

Cell viability assay. The effect of investigated compounds on the metabolic activity of the cells was
analyzed using the CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega #G7571). Metabolic
activity was examined under conditions corresponding to the respective infection assays. The CellTiterGlo® assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, medium was removed
from the culture after 2 days of incubation and 50% substrate reagent in PBS was added. After 10 min, the
supernatant was transferred into white microtiter plates and luminescence measured in an Orion II
Microplate Luminometer (Titertek Berthold). Untreated controls were set to 100% viability.

Peptide synthesis. EK1 (Xia et al., 2020b, 2020a) was synthesized automatically on a 0.10 mmol scale
using standard Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis techniques with the microwave synthesizer (Liberty blue;
CEM). Briefly, Fmoc protecting groups were removed with 20% piperidine in N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) and amino acid were added in 0.2 molar equivalent together with a 0.5 molar equivalent of Obenzotriazole-N,N,N’N’-tetramethyluronium-hexafluoro-phosphate and a 2 molar equivalent of
diisopropylethylamine. The coupling reaction was performed with microwaves in a few minutes followed
by a DMF wash. Once the synthesis was completed, the peptide was cleaved in 95% trifluoroacetic acid,
2.5% triisopropylsilane, and 2.5% H2O for one hour. The peptide residue was precipitated and washed with
cold diethyl ether and allowed to dry under vacuum to remove residual ether. The peptide was purified using
reversed phase preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Waters) in an
acetonitrile/water gradient under acidic conditions on a Phenomenex C18 Luna column (5 mm pore size,
100 Å particle size, 250 - 21.2 mm). Following purification, the peptide was lyophilized on a freeze dryer
(Labconco) for storage prior to use. The purified peptide mass was verified by liquid chromatography mass
spectroscopy (LCMS; Waters).

four-parametric nonlinear regression and one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison
test (ns not significant, * P < 0.01, ** P < 0.001, *** P < 0.0001) were performed using GraphPad Prism

Inspired by the well-established Zika virus infection assay that quantifies the viral envelope (E) protein by
a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) coupled antibody (Aubry et al., 2016; Conzelmann et al., 2019; Müller et
al., 2018, 2017; Röcker et al., 2018) we here aimed to detect the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 by a
similar approach. To adapt this in-cell ELISA to measure SARS-CoV-2 infection, we made use of the antiSARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 antibody 1A9 that targets the highly conserved loop region between the HR1 and
HR2 in the S2 subunit of the S protein (Ng et al., 2014; Walls et al., 2020) (nextstrain.org (Hadfield et al.,
2018)). Two SARS-CoV-2 permissive cell lines, Vero E6 (African green monkey epithelial kidney cells)
and Caco-2 (heterogeneous human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells), were seeded in 96-well
plates and inoculated with increasing multiplicities of infection (MOIs) of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate from
France (BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020). After 2, 24, 48 or 72 hours, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and
stained with 1:1,000, 1:5,000, or 1:10,000 dilutions of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 S protein antibody 1A9 for 1
hour. After washing, a 1:20,000 dilution of a secondary HRP-coupled anti-mouse antibody was added, cells
were incubated for 1 hour, washed again before TMB peroxidase substrate was added. After 5 min, reaction

Already at day 1, we observed a significant increase in ODs upon infection with the highest MOI in Vero
E6 (Fig. 1a) and Caco-2 (Fig. 1b) cells. At day 2, even the lowest MOI of 0.005 resulted in an OD signal
over background in Vero E6 cells, and a maximum OD of 0.157 ± 0.004 after infection with a MOI of 0.05.
Higher MOIs resulted in reduced ODs in both cell lines because of virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE)
resulting in detached cells, as monitored by light microscopy. S protein present in the viral inoculum did
not result in a significantly increased OD as compared to uninfected controls, as shown in the controls
experiments (day 0) in both cell lines. Thus, using a combination of a S protein-specific antibody and a
secondary detection antibody allows to detect SARS-CoV-2 infected cells by in-cell ELISA, with readily
detectable ODs already 2 days post infection.

We next inoculated both cell lines and the SARS-CoV-2 susceptible lung cell line Calu-3 (human epithelial
lung adenocarcinoma cells) with serial 2-fold dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 and performed the in-cell ELISA 2
days later. A viral inoculum dependent increase in the ODs was detected in Vero E6 cells after infection
with a MOI ≥ 0.05 (Fig. 1c), in Caco-2 cells already highly significant with a MOI of ≥ 0.008 (Fig. 1d) and
in Calu-3 cells at a MOI of 0.014 (Fig. 1e). Thus, under these experimental conditions, Caco-2 and Calu-3
cells allow a more sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication as Vero E6 cells.

To optimize assay sensitivity, i.e. the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio, we evaluated different secondary antibody
dilutions. For this, Caco-2 cells were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 (MOIs of 0.0002 to 0.05), fixed at day
2, and stained with the anti-S protein antibody. Thereafter, four different dilutions of the HRP-coupled
secondary antibody were added. OD measurements revealed that highest ODs were obtained with 10,000fold diluted secondary antibody (Fig. 1f). However, when calculating the S/N ratios (OD of infected wells
divided by OD of uninfected cells), also the 15,000-fold dilution revealed a similar assay sensitivity with
maximum S/N values of 7.9 as compared to 7.5 for the 1:10,000 dilution (Fig. 1g). Thus, all subsequent
experiments were performed in Caco-2 cells that were seeded at a density of 30,000 cells per well to increase
ODs, and stained with 5,000-fold diluted anti-S and 15,000-fold diluted secondary antibodies.

Having demonstrated that the in-cell ELISA quantifies infection by a French SARS-CoV-2 isolate, we
wanted to validate that isolates from other geographic areas are also detected. The French isolate clusters
with the reference Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 isolate whereas the Netherlands/01 strain can be grouped to clade A2a
(nextstrain.org (Hadfield et al., 2018)). The antibody-targeted S2 domain is generally conserved between
SARS-CoV-2 strains which should allow detection (Ng et al., 2014; Walls et al., 2020) (nextstrain.org

(Hadfield et al., 2018)). To test this, Caco-2 cells were inoculated with increasing MOIs of the
Netherlands/01 isolate as well as two isolates from Ulm, Southern Germany. Intracellular S protein
expression was determined 2 days later by in-cell ELISA. As shown in Fig. 2, virus infection was readily
detectable even upon infection with very low MOIs, suggesting that the ELISA may be applied to all SARSCoV-2 isolates.

Results shown in Fig. 2 indicate that the assay allows to detect infected wells even after inoculation with
very low viral MOIs, e.g. a MOI of 0.0003 of the Ulm/01/2020 isolate resulted in a significantly increased
OD as compared to uninfected controls. We were wondering whether this high sensitivity and ease of
quantitation may also allow to determine the TCID50 of virus stocks, that is usually done on Vero E6 cells
by manually counting infected wells using a microscope. To test this, we titrated virus, inoculated Vero E6
cells and incubated them for 4 days. We identified infected wells by eye (Fig. 3a), but also performed the
in-cell ELISA and set a threshold of three times the standard deviation above the uninfected control to
determine the number of infected wells per virus dilution (Fig. 3b). The subsequent calculation of TCID50/ml
by Reed and Muench revealed exactly the same viral titer for the in-cell ELISA (Fig. 3b) as for microscopic
evaluation (Fig. 3a) showing that the established ELISA is suitable for determination of viral titers.

We next set out to analyse whether lysozyme, a well-known antimicrobial enzyme that is abundant in body
fluids such as tears (McDermott, 2013), saliva (Petit and Jollès, 1963), human milk (Andreas et al., 2015;
Chanan et al., 1964; Koenig et al., 2005) and mucus (Dajani et al., 2005) may affect SARS-CoV-2 infection.
To this end, the French viral isolate was treated with lysozyme purified from human neutrophils, and then
used to infect Caco-2 cells. Simultaneously, two more SARS-CoV-2 isolates were treated with lysozyme
from chicken egg white and inoculated on Caco-2 cells. In-cell S protein ELISA performed 2 days later
demonstrated that none of the lysozyme preparations inhibited viral infection, suggesting that this innate
immune defence enzyme does not protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection in saliva or mucus of the
respiratory tract.

We then examined whether the ELISA allows to determine the antiviral activity of known SARS-CoV-2
inhibitors. Caco-2 cells were treated with serial dilutions of the small SARS-CoV-2 inhibiting molecules
chloroquine (Jeon et al., 2020; M. Wang et al., 2020), lopinavir (Jeon et al., 2020), remdesivir (Jeon et al.,
2020; M. Wang et al., 2020) and the peptide inhibitor EK1 (Xia et al., 2020b, 2020a), and were then infected
with SARS-CoV-2. In-cell ELISAs performed 2 days later demonstrated a concentration-dependent
antiviral activity of the tested compounds reflecting typical dose-response curves of antiviral agents
(Fig. 5a-d). This also allowed the calculation of the inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) values, i.e. 23.9 µM
for chloroquine (Fig. 5a), 21.0 µM for lopinavir (Fig. 5b), 32.4 nM for remdesivir (Fig. 5c), and 303.5 nM
for EK1 (Fig. 5d). These values are in the same range as previously reported on Vero E6 cells (1.13 - 7.36
µM for chloroquine (Jeon et al., 2020; J. Liu et al., 2020; M. Wang et al., 2020), 9.12 µM for lopinavir (Jeon
et al., 2020), 770 nM for remdesivir (M. Wang et al., 2020), and 2,468 nM for EK1 (Xia et al., 2020a)), and
demonstrate that the in-cell S protein ELISA can be easily adapted to determine antiviral activities of
candidate drugs. Cytotoxicity assays that were performed simultaneously in the absence of virus revealed
no effects on cell viability by antivirally active concentrations of lopinavir, remdesivir and EK1 (Fig. 5b-d).
However, reduced cellular viability rates were observed in the presence of chloroquine concentrations >1
µM (Fig. 5a), which is in line with the fact that part of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of this anti-malaria
drug is attributed to its interference with cell organelle function (J. Liu et al., 2020; Mauthe et al., 2018).

Finally, we evaluated whether the assay determines the neutralization activity of serum from SARS-CoV-2
convalescent individuals. For this, sera that were tested positive or negative for anti-SARS-CoV-2
immunoglobulins, were serially titrated and incubated with SARS-CoV-2 for 90 minutes at room
temperature before inoculation of Caco-2 cells. Two days later, we performed the in-cell ELISA as
described. As shown in Fig. 6, the two control sera, that were obtained before the COVID-19 outbreak or
shown to contain no SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins, did not affect infection. In contrast, both COVID-19
sera neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 6). Serum 1 resulted in a more than 50% inhibition at a titer
of 640 and Serum 2 already neutralized SARS-CoV-2 at the 1,280-fold dilution. This confirms that the incell ELISA is suitable to detect neutralizing sera. Furthermore, analogous to the IC50, we calculated the
“inhibitory titers 50” using nonlinear regression, and determined titers of 654 and 1,076 respectively. These
titers corresponded well to the presence of immunoglobulins which suggests that the here established
method can be used to detect and quantify the neutralizing capacities of sera from COVID-19 patients.

We here describe a novel assay that allows quantification SARS-CoV-2 infection by measuring intracellular
levels of the viral S protein in bulk cell cultures. The assay is based on the detection of de novo synthesized
S protein by a S2-targeting antibody, and quantification via a corresponding secondary horseradish
peroxidase (HRP) -linked antibody. This more sensitively detects nuances of viral replication than counting
infected cells and is faster than determining titers of progeny virus. At high viral input (e.g. MOI 3), infection
can already be detected after 24 hours, and at low viral input (e.g. MOI 0.005) after 48 hours. The assay has
a linear range and signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios that are suitable to accurately determine the antiviral activity
of drugs (IC50s), as shown for entry blocker EK1 (Xia et al., 2020a, 2020b), or intracellularly acting
inhibitors remdesivir and lopinavir (Jeon et al., 2020; M. Wang et al., 2020). Additionally, the assay can be
applied to detect and quantify titers of neutralizing sera of COVID-19 patients, all within only 2 days. This
in-cell ELISA is easy to perform and follows standard ELISA readouts using HRP-mediated TMB substrate
conversion and OD measurements after acidification with no need for expensive equipment.

Notably, the assay has been developed to be carried out in microtiter plates and should allow a convenient
medium-to-high throughput testing of antivirals, antibodies, or antisera with timely availability of results,
which is in the fast development of antivirals and in diagnostics. Due to targeting a highly conserved region
and the relatively high sequence homology of global SARS-CoV-2 isolates, it is also applicable to other
isolates as those that were tested herein. Furthermore, conservation in between related viruses suggest that,
also SARS-CoV, and related civet SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like coronavirus infection can be detected
with this assay (Ng et al., 2014; Walls et al., 2020). The in-cell ELISA was established using permissive
Vero E6 and Caco-2 cells and confirmed using Calu-3 cells, but principally all other cell lines or primary
cells supporting productive SARS-CoV-2 infection may also be used. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 is a BSL3 pathogen which requires high safety requirements, which are usually at the expense of throughput. One
additional advantage of the in-cell ELISA is that treatment of cells with paraformaldehyde results in the
fixation and inactivation of virions, allowing a downstream processing of the plates outside a BSL-3 facility.

Another application of the in-cell S protein ELISA is to reliably determine infectious viral titres in virus
stocks, cell culture supernatants or from patient swabs. Viral titers are usually quantified by limiting dilution
analysis and microscopic determination of infected wells or staining of SARS-CoV-2 induced plaques or
foci with crystal violet, neutral red or specific antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 antigens. We found that the incell ELISA allows to i) discriminate infected from uninfected wells, and ii) even after infection with very
low MOIs (as low as 0.000005, which corresponds to one virion per three wells) at 4 days post infection
(Fig. 3), representing an alternative for non-biased determining the TCID50 without the need of counting
infected wells or plaques.

390
391
392
393

Conclusively, the S protein specific in-cell ELISA quantifies SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of different cell
lines and allows to rapidly screen for and determine the potency of antiviral compounds. Thus, it represents
a promising, rapid, readily available and easy to implement alternative to the current repertoire of laboratory
techniques studying SARS-CoV-2 and will facilitate future research and drug development on COVID-19.
