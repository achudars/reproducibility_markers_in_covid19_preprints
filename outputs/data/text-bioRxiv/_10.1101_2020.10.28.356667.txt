Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 virus caused the most severe pandemic around the world, and vaccine
development for urgent use became a crucial issue. Inactivated virus formulated vaccines such as
Hepatitis A, oral polio vaccine, and smallpox proved to be reliable approaches for immunization
for prolonged periods. During the pandemic, we produced an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
candidate, having the advantages of being manufactured rapidly and tested easily in comparison
with recombinant vaccines. In this study, an inactivated virus vaccine that includes a gamma
irradiation process for the inactivation as an alternative to classical chemical inactivation methods
so that there is no extra purification required has been optimized. The vaccine candidate (OZG38.61.3) was then applied in mice by employing the intradermal route, which decreased the
requirement of a higher concentration of inactivated virus for proper immunization, unlike most of
the classical inactivated vaccine treatments. Hence, the novelty of our vaccine candidate (OZG38.61.3) is that it is a non-adjuvant added, gamma-irradiated, and intradermally applied inactive
viral vaccine. Efficiency and safety dose (either 1013 or 1014 viral copy per dose) of OZG-38.61.3
was initially determined in Balb/c mice. This was followed by testing the immunogenicity and
protective efficacy of OZG-38.61.3. Human ACE2-encoding transgenic mice were immunized
and then infected with a dose of infective SARS-CoV-2 virus for the challenge test. Findings of
this study show that vaccinated mice have lower SARS-CoV-2 viral copy number in oropharyngeal
specimens along with humoral and cellular immune responses against the SARS-CoV-2, including
the neutralizing antibodies similar to those shown in Balb/c mice without substantial toxicity.
Subsequently, plans are being made for the commencement of Phase 1 clinical trial of the OZG38.61.3 vaccine for the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction
The development of a vaccine has the upmost biomedical priority due to the global COVID-19
pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. A safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is urgently
required to halt the global COVID-19 pandemic. Several vaccine candidates have started clinical
trials and some are in still preclinical research (Gao et al. 2020a; B. L. Corey et al., 2020; Yu et al.
2020). Small animal model systems are critical for better understanding the COVID-19 disease
pathways and to determine medical precautions for improved global health, considering that there
are currently no approved vaccines and only one antiviral approved for emergency use for SARSCoV-2 (Sheahan et al. 2017; Dinnon et al. 2020). More significantly, several pioneering studies
have shown that both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV use the same human angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (hACE2) cellular receptor to enter cells (Walls et al. 2020; Li et al. 2003; Zhou et al.
2020a; Sun et al. 2020). The crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein receptor-binding
domain (RBD) which binds to hACE2 has been described, with an approximately 10- to 20-fold
greater affinity toward hACE2 than SARS-CoV binds. Unfortunately, standard laboratory mice
cannot be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the discrepancy of the S protein to the murine
orthologous (mACE2) of the human receptor, making model development complicated and
difficult (Zhou et al. 2020b; Dinnon et al. 2020). Thus, wild-type C57BL/6 mice cannot be infected
efficiently with SARS-CoV-2 because there is no hACE2 protein expressed that supports SARSCoV-2 binding and infection. On the other hand, both young and aged hACE2 positive mice
showed high viral loads in the lung, trachea, and brain upon intranasal infection in the literature
(Sun et al. 2020; Letko, Marzi, and Munster 2020; Wan et al. 2020; Winkler et al. 2020).
For understanding viral pathogenesis, vaccine production, and drug screening, animal models are
crucial. To assess preclinical efficacy, non-human primates (NHPs) are the best animal models.

The implementation of NHPs, however, is limited by the high costs, availability, and complexity
of the necessary husbandry settings. For research and antiviral therapeutic progress, suitable small
animal models are therefore important. Mouse models are popular because of their affordability,
availability, and simple genetic structure, and have been commonly used to research human
coronavirus pathogenesis (Cockrell et al. 2018; Jiang et al. 2020). As a cellular receptor, SARSCoV-2 could use the ACE2 receptor of the human, bat, or civet but not the mouse (Jiang et al.
2020; Zhou et al. 2020b). Therefore, it seems that mice expressing hACE2 would be a conceivable
choice for the vaccine challenge tests.
In this study, we tested our vaccine candidate (OZG-38.61.3) inactivated with gamma irradiation
to assess their immunogenicity and protective efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 viral challenge in
K18-hACE2 mice and showed the efficacy of the vaccination in c57/Balb/C mice. K18-hACE2transgenic mice, in which hACE2 expression is powered by the epithelial cell cytokeratin-18 (K18)
promoter, were originally designed for the study of SARS-CoV pathogenesis and lead to a lethal
infection model (McCray et al. 2007; Yang, Pabon, and Murry 2014; Winkler et al. 2020). This
study aimed to investigate whether the vaccinated transgenic mouse has a lower SARS-CoV-2 viral
copy number in nasal specimens along with increased humoral and cellular immune responses,
including neutralizing antibodies to the virus, without experiencing substantial toxicity.

Material & Methods
Human Samples
In vitro isolation and propagation of SARS-CoV-2 from diagnosed COVID-19 patients were
described in our previous study (Taştan et al., 2020). The study for SARS-CoV-2 genome
sequencing was approved by the Ethics Committee of Acıbadem Mehmet Ali Aydınlar University
(ATADEK-2020/05/41) and informed consent from the patients was obtained to publish
identifying information/images. These data do not contain any private information of the patients.
All techniques had been executed according to the applicable guidelines.
Manufacturing Gamma-irradiated inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate
For the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples to have clinical significance, it is
extremely important to comply with the rules regarding sample selection, taking into the
appropriate transfer solution, transportation to the laboratory, and storage under appropriate
conditions when necessary (Taştan et al., 2020). The production of a candidate vaccine for gammairradiated inactivated SARS-CoV-2 was reported in our previous report (Sir Karakus et al. 2021).
In this study, the last version of our vaccine candidate, OZG-38.61.3 was constituted from 1013 or
1014 viral copy of SARS-CoV-2 in a dose without adjuvant.
Viral RNA Extraction and Viral Genome Sequencing
Viral RNA extractions were performed by Quick-RNA Viral Kit (Zymo Research, USA) in
Acıbadem Labcell Cellular Therapy Laboratory BSL-3 Unit according to the manufacturer's
protocols. Library preparation was performed by CleanPlex SARS-CoV-2 Research and
Surveillance NGS Panel (Paragon Genomics, USA) according to the manufacturer’s user guide.

For the construction of the library, The CleanPlex® Dual-Indexed PCR Primers for Illumina®
(Paragon Genomics, USA) were used by combining i5 and i7 primers. Samples were sequenced by
Illumina MiSeq instrument with paired-end 131 bp long fragments. The data that passed the quality
control were aligned to the reference genome (NC_045512.2) in Wuhan and a variant list was
created with variant calling. The data analysis was described in detail in our previous study (Ozden
Hatirnaz Ng et al., under revision).
Nanosight
Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) measurements were carried out for SARS-CoV-2 titer in
suspension by using The NanoSight NS300 (Amesbury, UK). Samples were diluted with distilled
water 1:10 ratio and transferred to Nanosight cuvette as 1 ml. Measurements were performed at
room temperature with 5 different 60-second video recording.
Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus imaging by transmission electron microscopy
Viruses were inactivated and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.2) for 2.5 h. One
drop of glutaraldehyde-treated virus suspension was placed on the carbon-coated grid for 10 min.
The remaining solution was absorbed with a filter paper and the grid was stained by a negative
staining procedure. Then, it was evaluated under a transmission electron microscope (Thermo
Fisher Scientific- Talos L120C) and photographed.
In-solution tryptic digestion
In-solution digestion was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using ‘in-solution
tryptic digestion and guanidination kit’ (#89895, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The protocol
can be summarized as follow: 10 μg protein sample was added to 15 μL 50 mM Ambic containing

100 mM DTT solution. The volume was completed to 27 μL and incubated at 95ºC for 5 min.
Iodoacetamide (IAA) was added to the heated sample to a 10 mM final concentration and incubated
in the dark for 20 min. 1 μL of 100ng/μL trypsin was then added and incubated for 3 hours at 37ºC.
1 μL of 100ng/μL trypsin was added to the peptide mixture and incubated overnight at 30ºC. After
incubation, the solution was vacuum concentrated to dryness and the peptides were resuspended in
0.1% FA for the nLC-MS/MS analysis.
Nano-liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS) analysis
The peptides were analyzed by nLC-MS/MS using an Ultimate 3000 RSLC nanosystem (Dionex,
Thermo Scientific, USA) coupled to a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA).
The entire system was controlled by Xcalibur 4.0 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Highperformance liquid chromatography(HPLC) separation was performed using mobiles phases of A
(%0.1 Formic Acid) and B (%80 Acetonitril+%0.1 Formic Acid). Digested peptides were preconcentrated and desalted on a trap column. Then the peptides were transferred to an Acclaim
PepMap RSLC C18 analytical column (75 μmx15 cmx2 μm, 100 Å diameter, Thermo Scientific,
USA). The gradient for separation was 6-32% B in 80 min, 32-50% B in 40 min, 50-90% B in 10
min, 90% in 15 min, 90-6% B in 10 min, and 6% B for 10 min with the flow rate of 300 nL/min.
Full scan MS spectra were acquired with the following parameters: resolution 70.000, scan range
400-2000 m/z, target automatic gain control (AGC)3×106, maximum injection time 60 ms, spray
voltage 2.3 kV. MS/MS analysis was performed by data-dependent acquisition selecting the top
ten precursor ions. The instrument was calibrated using a standard positive calibrant (LTQ Velos
ESI Positive Ion Calibration Solution 88323, Pierce, USA) before each analysis.

nLC-MS/MS data analysis
Raw data were analyzed with Proteom Discoverer 2.2 (Thermo Scientific, USA) software for
protein identification and the following parameters were used; peptide mass tolerance 10 ppm,
MS/MS mass tolerance 0.2 Da, mass accuracy 2 ppm, tolerant miscarriage 1, minimum peptide
length 6 amino acids, fixed changes cysteine carbamidomethylation, unstable changes methionine
oxidation, and asparagine deamination. The minimum number of peptides identified for each
protein was considered to be 1 and obtained data were searched in the Uniprot/Swissprot database.
Vero Host Cell Protein ELISA
Residual Host Cell Protein (HCP) analysis in a viral product supernatant was performed with the
manufacturer’s protocol of the Cygnustechnologies-VERO Cell HCP ELISA kit (F500). The
absorbance was read at 450/650nm with the microplate reader (Omega ELISA Reader).
Vero DNA nanodrop
The vaccine candidate was solved in 100 cc pyrogen-free water. Firstly, pyrogen-free water was
blanked and one drop sample was measured at the dsDNA program using Thermo Scientific
NanoDrop™ One Spectrophotometers to determine Vero residual DNA and A260/A280 ratio for
DNA/protein purity.
Replicative Competent Coronavirus test with gamma-irradiated inactivated SARS-CoV-2
vaccine candidates
3µg of lyophilized inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate in 100 µl pyrogen-free water was
inoculated into %90 confluent Vero cells at 37C. The supernatant of this culture was replenished
with fresh Vero cell culture every 3-to-5 days up to 21 days of incubation. As a negative control,

only 100 µl pyrogen-free water was inoculated into Vero cells and cultured for 21 days with the
same treatments. At the end of the incubation, the final supernatant was collected, centrifuged at
2000G for 10 min to remove cell debris. Next, the supernatants were concentrated 10x with 100kDa
Amplicon tubes. The concentrated samples were tested in the xCelligence RTCA system in a dosedependent manner as 10-1 to 10-6 to determine the cytopathic effect.
SRID assay
5 μg / ml of SARS-COV-2 Spike S1 Monoclonal Antibody (ElabScience) antibodies were added
in the gel at a concentration of 2%. Inactive SARS-CoV-2 was kept at room temperature for 15-30
minutes with 1% zwittergent detergent (mix 9 test antigens: 1 Zwittergent). Incubation was
provided in a humid environment for 18 hours. The gel was washed with PBS, taken on the glass
surface, and covered with blotter paper, and kept at 37 ° C until it dried. By staining the gel with
Coomassie Brillant Blue, the presence of S antigen was determined according to the dark blue color
(colorimetric).
Quality Control Tests
Sterility was done in a BACTEC blood culture bottle along with the BACTEC™ FX blood
culturing instrument (BD). The endotoxin level was determined with the Gel-clot endotoxin
Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) test (Charles River Laboratories). Mycoplasma analysis was
performed with Mycoplasma species 500 PCR kit at GeneAmp PCR System 2700 (Applied
Biosystems). Quality control tests of the vaccine including levels of chemistry analysis (Na, Cl, K,
Ca) and Total Protein (The ADVIA 1800 Clinical Chemistry System, Siemens), osmolarity
(Osmometer, freezing point depression), Ph, Glucose, Albumin (Dimension EX-L), sterility,
mycoplasma, endotoxin level, and impurity assay were performed in Acıbadem Labmed

CoV-2 viral copy per microliter lyophilized vaccine without adjuvant reconstituted in 100 cc
pyrogen-free water and both negative and positive control groups vaccinated with 100 cc pyrogenfree water. In whole groups, a booster dose of 1x1013 and 1x1014 SARS-CoV-2 viral copy per
microliter vaccine was administered intradermally on day 15 post-first vaccination. All animals
were monitored daily for clinical symptoms, body-weight changes body temperature change
(Supplementary figure 1). 25 days following vaccination, K18-hACE2 mice were intranasally
infected with a 3x104 TCID50 dose of infective SARS-CoV-2 in 30µl solution in Biosafety level
cabin II in Transgenic Animal Biosafety level 3 laboratory (ABSL-3) of AAALAC International
accredited Acıbadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University Laboratory Animal Application and
Research Center (ACUDEHAM; Istanbul, Turkey). TCID50 dose of SARS-CoV-2 was calculated
in the previous study (Sir Karakus et al. 2021). Starting from the day after the challenge, clinical
symptoms, body-weight changes body temperature change controlled every 12 hours. At 48 hours
after the challenge, the oropharyngeal swabs were collected from mice in all groups and analyzed
for viral copy number. At 96 hours after the challenge, the nasopharyngeal swabs and sera were
collected from whole groups including negative control groups to analyze immunological and
virological assays. After serum collection, all mice were euthanized. Biopsy samples were
collected including skin which was the vaccination part, brain, testis, ovarium, intestine, spleen,
kidney, liver, lung, heart. Biopsy samples were collected and anatomically divided for qPCR
analysis and histological and TEM examination.

system. All images were acquired as the posterior prone position of mice. The X-ray ran at 48 kV,
distance to source grating 70cm, 111°, and shooting with 0.2 and 0.3 mA.
Histopathological Applications
Transgenic mice and Balb/c mice were sacrificed on postimmunization for histopathology analysis.
Dissected organs including the cerebellum, lungs, liver, kidneys, skin, intestine, and part of the
spleen of sacrificed mice were taken into 10% buffered formalin solution before routine tissue
processing for histopathological analysis after weighting. The histopathology analysis of the lung
tissues of challenge mice groups was performed at the Department of Pathology at Acibadem
Maslak Hospital.
SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA
Before the sacrification, blood samples were collected from the whole group of mice. The serum
was collected with centrifugation methods. Serum samples were stored at -40 C. To detect the
SARS-COV-2 IgG antibody in mouse serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA Kit (Creative,
DEIASL019) was used. Before starting the experiment with the whole sample, reagent and
microplates pre-coated with whole SARS-CoV-2 lysate were brought to room temperature. As a
positive control, 100 ng mouse SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 monoclonal antibody was used
(commercially available as E-AB-V1005, Elabscience). Serum samples were diluted at 1:64, 1:128,
and 1:256 in a sample diluent, provided in the kit. Anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Horseradish
peroxidase enzyme (mHRP enzyme) was used as a detector. After incubation with the stopping
solution, the color change was read at 450nm with the microplate reader (Omega ELISA Reader).

TCID50 (Median Tissue Culture Infectious Dose) of SARS-CoV-2 was determined by incubating
the virus in a serial dilution manner with the Vero cell line (CCL81, ATCC) in gold microelectrodes
embedded microtiter wells in xCELLigence Real-Time Cell Analysis (RTCA) instruments (ACEA,
Roche) for 8 days (Sir Karakus et al. 2021). Neutralization assay of sera from transgenic and balb/c
mice groups was performed at 1:128, and 1:256 dilutions pre-incubated with a 100X TCID50 dose
of SARS-CoV-2 at room temperature for 60 min. Next, the pre-incubated mixture was inoculated
into the Vero-cell-coated flat-bottom 96-well plate which was analyzed at the end of 96 hr
following standard MTT protocol. Viable cell analysis was determined by colorimetric change at
the ELISA system. The neutralization ratio was determined by assessing percent neutralization by
dividing the value of serum-virus treated condition wells by the value of untreated control Vero
cells. 100% of neutralization was normalized to only Vero condition while 0% of neutralization
was normalized to the value of only 100x TCID50 dose of SARS-CoV-2 inoculated Vero cell
condition. For example, for the sample of 1:128 serum sample, the value was 0,651 while the value
for control Vero well as 0,715, and the value for control SARS-CoV-2 inoculated well was 0,2.
The calculation is as %neutralization= ((0,651-0,2)*100)/(0,715-0,2). This gave 87,5% virus
neutralization. This calculation was performed for each mouse in the group and the mean of the
virus neutralization was determined.
Mouse IFN-γ ELISPOT analysis
Mouse Spleen T cells were centrifuged with Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) at 300xg for 10 min.
Pellet was resuspended in TexMACs (Miltenyi Biotech, GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) cell
culture media (%3 human AB serum and 1% Pen/Strep). 500,000 cells in 100 µl were added into
microplate already coated with a monoclonal antibody specific for mouse IFN-γ. 1000 nM SARSCoV-2 virus Peptivator pool (SARS-CoV-2 S, N, and M protein peptide pool) (Miltenyi Biotech,

GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) were added into each well including mouse spleen T cells.
The microplate was incubated in a humidified 37°C CO2 incubator. After 48 h incubation, IFN-γ
secreting cells were determined with Mouse IFNγ ELISpot Kit (RnDSystems, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The spots were counted under the dissection microscope (Zeiss,
Germany).
Unstimulated/Stimulated T cell cytokine response and immunophenotype
500,000 cells isolated from mouse spleen were incubated with 1000 nM SARS-CoV-2 virus
Peptivator pool (SARS-CoV-2 S, N, and M protein peptide pool) (Miltenyi Biotech, GmbH,
Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) in a humidified 37°C CO2 incubator. After 48h incubation, the
mouse cytokine profile was analyzed using the supernatant of the cultures using the MACSPlex
Cytokine 10 kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Also, to determine T cell activation and proliferation, the
restimulated cells were stained with the antibodies including CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD25 as an
activation marker (Miltenyi Biotec). The Cytokine bead array and the T cell activation and
proportions were analyzed using the MACSQuant Analyzer (Miltenyi Biotec).
Statistics
Normally distributed data in bar graphs was tested using student’s t-tests for two independent
means. The Mann-Whitney U test was employed for comparison between two groups of nonnormally distributed data. Statistical analyses were performed using the Graphpad Prism and SPSS
Statistics software. Each data point represents an independent measurement. Bar plots report the
mean and standard deviation of the mean. The threshold of significance for all tests was set at
*p<0.05. ns is non-significant.

Results:
Characterization of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus constituting OZG-38.61.3 vaccine
candidates.
One of the conclusions of our previous study was that the adjuvant positive vaccine administration
should be removed from the newly designed version of the OZG-38.61 vaccine model as it caused
inflammatory reaction in the skin, cerebellum, and kidney in toxicity analysis of vaccinated mice
(Sir Karakus et al. 2021). Hence, it was decided to increase the SARS-CoV-2 effective viral copy
dose (1x1013 or 1x1014 viral copies per dose) without an adjuvant in this new version of the OZG38.61 vaccine. Firstly, we determined whether this vaccine product comprises all identified SARSCoV-2 mutations. The obtained sequences from the propagated SARS-CoV-2 virus were compared
with the GISAID database and the protein levels of the variant information were examined (Fig.
1A). We determined that the SARS-CoV-2 strain forming OZG-38.61.3 vaccine covered
previously identified mutation variants (red-colored) with new variants (blue colored) (Fig. 1B).
The data of all defined mutations were presented in detail in Supplementary Table 2. Using
Nanosight technology, we determined that the size of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 was 187.9 +/- 10.0
nm (mode) with a concentration of 4.23x109 +/- 1.88x108 particles/ ml (Fig. 1C). As a result of the
LC-MS-MS analysis, the presence of proteins belonging to the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in
the analyzed sample (Fig. 1D). Quality control tests are illustrated in Supplementary Table 3.
Four of the defined proteins were Master Proteins and have been identified with high reliability
(Supplementary Table 3). Other proteins were Master Candidate proteins and their identification
confidence interval is medium. The data of all defined proteins were presented in detail in
Supplementary Table 3. Also, the transmission electron microscope was evaluated with the
negative staining method and the main structures (envelope/spike) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus

particles in the final product were well preserved (Fig. 1E). Also, TEM analysis confirmed the
virus size was 70-200 nm with the presence of aggregates as determined in the Nanosight analysis.
On the other hand, the concentration of the Vero host cell protein per vaccine dose was determined
<4 ng and Vero host DNA per dose was not determined. According to all these analyses, OZG38.61.3 has been shown to pass all vaccine development criteria in the final product
(Supplementary Table 1), comprise all the mutations identified up to date, preserve the protein
structure and contain pure inactive virus free of residues.

Acute Toxicity and Efficacy Study of OZG-38.61.3 in Balb/c mice.
Acute toxicity and efficacy assays were studied in Balb/c mice. There were 3 groups in this study:
control group (n=5), dose 1013 viral particles per dose (n=5), and dose 1014 viral particles per dose
(n=5) (Fig. 2A). There was no difference in nutrition and water consumption between the groups,
as well as in total body weight and organ weight (Supplementary Table 4). Version 3 of the OZG38.61 vaccine did not differ in the histopathologic analysis from the control group, including the
highest dose of 1014 (Supplementary Table 4). Firstly, SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG at 1:128
dilution of serum isolated from mice groups showed a significant increase in the highest dose
(1014) vaccinated group in comparison with the control group (Fig. 2B). Secondly, in order to
determine the neutralization capacity of serum collected from the immunized mice, 1:128 and
1:256 dilutions of sera were pre-inoculated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and following 96-hour
incubation, MTT analysis was performed. Findings showed that the dose 1014 vaccinated mice
managed to neutralize the virus at a statistically significant level (p<0.05) at both dilutions (Fig.
2C). The Balb/c study showed that upon restimulation, gamma interferon secretion of the T
lymphocytes from both vaccination groups increased significantly in comparison with the nonvaccinated mice group and PBS non-stimulated internal control groups (Fig. 2D). Furthermore,
spleen T cells stimulated with the peptides were analyzed through flow cytometry in order to
determine proportions of activated (CD25+) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but no proliferation was
observed (Fig. 2E). Next, the supernatant of the incubated cells was analyzed using a cytokine bead
array for a more detailed examination. Both doses of OZG-38.61.3 (especially dose 1014) increased
IL-2, GM-CSF, gamma-IFN levels and caused Th-1 response (Fig. 2F). At the same time, IL-10
was increased in both dose groups, suggesting that the Tr1 (Regulatory T lymphocyte type 1
response) response was stimulated (Fig. 2F) (Andolfi et al. 2012). Moreover, we performed

histopathology analysis of the lung, liver, and kidney to determine inflammation, hemorrhage, and
eosinophil infiltration (Fig. 2G and Supplementary Table 4). There was no significant toxicity
including hemorrhage and eosinophil infiltration in overall organs (Fig. 2G and Supplementary
Table 4). Therefore, 1x1013 and 1x1014 doses of OZG-38.61.3 led to the effective neutralizing
SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody production and cytokine secretion, hence a satisfactory Th1
response, without significant toxicity.

Challenge Test with OZG-38.61.3 vaccinated humanized ACEII+ mice
Following efficacy and safety analysis of OZG-38.61.3 in Balb/c mice, post-immunization
protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection in human ACE2 expressing transgenic mice was
determined. Viral challenge analyzes were performed in K18-hACE2 (Jackson Lab). Two mice
groups were vaccinated with the 1013 and 1014 doses of the vaccine. Mice were euthanized for in
vitro efficacy tests and histopathology analysis post-challenge on day 4 (Fig. 3A). During the
challenge, there was no significant change in food and water consumption along with temperature
(Supplementary Figure 1). Also, although not statistically significant, weight distribution was
more uniform in vaccine groups (Supplementary Figure 1).
This was followed by viral load analyzes on oropharyngeal swab samples on the 2nd and 4th days
of the challenge test. While there was no significant change in the virus load in the positive control
group, it was observed that the virus load decreased in the vaccine groups with the exception of
only one mouse, whereas it completely disappeared in one (Fig. 3B). It was observed that the mean
virus load decreased statistically significantly over time, especially at the highest dose (1014),
between 48-96 hours. There was no change in the positive control group (Fig. 3C). When compared
with the positive control group at 96th hour, a 3-log decrease in viral copy number was determined
especially in the highest dose vaccine group (Fig. 3D). No difference was observed between the
groups in the lung X-ray imaging analysis of the mice groups taken in our study (Fig. 4A). Also, it
is observed that both vaccine doses do not cause antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) side
effects in the lung in histopathology analysis (Fig. 4B). No histologically significant change was
observed in the positive control and vaccine groups, although positive control has signs of partial
alveolar fusion and inflammation in 1 mouse (Fig. 4B). This finding is similar to chest radiographs.
The absence of an additional pathology in the lung, especially in vaccine groups, was another

additional finding confirming that ADE does not occur and the inactivity of our vaccine. Thus,
viral load analyses in the oropharyngeal specimens showed that the SARS-CoV-2 infection was
significantly reduced in the vaccinated groups.

In vitro efficacy analysis of serum and T cells isolated from mice following challenge test
SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody analysis was performed in 1: 128 and 1: 256 titrations of serum
isolated from blood. In SARS-CoV-2 antibody measurements, antibody development was observed
in the vaccine groups, including the virus-administered group (Fig. 5A). According to the IgG
ELISA result, the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody increase was significantly detected at 1:256 dilutions
in the dose 1014 vaccinated group compared to the positive control group (non-vaccinated)
(p=0.001) (Fig. 5A). The neutralizing antibody study also showed a significant increase in both
vaccine groups compared to the positive control at 1: 256, similar to the antibody levels (Fig. 5B).
However, there was no significant change in gamma interferon responses from mouse spleen T
cells without re-stimulation (Fig. 5C). Next, we wanted to determine the cytokine secretion profile
and T cell frequencies between groups without a re-stimulation. Although it was not statistically
significant, TNFsecretion was also seen to increase in the dose 1014 group (Fig. 5D). The increase
of IL-2 in the highest-dose (1014) vaccine group indicates that the mice vaccinated after viral
challenge show a Th1 type response (Fig. 5D). Also, when we compare SARS-CoV-2 infected
non-vaccinated positive control with non-vaccinated and un-infected negative control, we
determined that IL-10 cytokine, known as cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor, was significantly
increased (Fig. 5D), suggesting downregulation of the expression of cytokines (Eskdale et al.
1997). On the other hand, we wanted to determine a change in the proportion of spleen T cell
subsets upon re-stimulation with SARS-CoV-2 peptides (Fig. 5E). Although total CD3+ T and
CD4+ T cell populations did not increase in the vaccinated groups regarding control groups,
CD25+ CD4+ T cell population was determined to increase in dose groups (Fig. 5E). Depending
on the viral challenge, frequencies of CD3+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes significantly increased in
the positive control group (non-vaccinated viral challenge group), while this increase was not

observed in the vaccinated group (Fig. 5E). Only an increase in the amount of activated (CD25+)
CD4+ T cell was observed in the vaccinated groups (Fig. 5E). This data showing that SARS-CoV2 viral infection was caused to stimulate T cell response along with increase of Th1 inhibitory Tr1
(T cell regulatory)-related IL-10 cytokine secretion and with the absence of Th2-related cytokine
response. To sum up, the in vitro efficacy analysis of the challenge test showed that the presence
of active T lymphocytes significantly increased in the highest dose (1014) vaccine group. The study
indicated that viral dissemination was blocked by SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and
neutralizing antibodies. It was also determined that the ADE effect was not observed, and also
confirming that OZG-38.61.3 was non-replicative. As the cellular immune response, CD4+ T cell
activation was present, especially at the highest dose, and T cell response was biased to the Th1
response type as desired in the immunization.

Discussion:
The SARS-CoV-2 virus caused one of the severest pandemic around the world. The safe and
effective vaccine development for urgent use became more of an issue to end the global COVID19 pandemic. Several vaccine candidates have recently begun clinical phase studies, and many
others are in preclinical development (Gao et al. 2020b; L. Corey et al. 2020). Here, we optimized
an inactivated virus vaccine which includes the gamma irradiation process for the inactivation as
an alternative to classical chemical inactivation methods so that there is no extra purification
required. Previous studies showed that gamma-radiation can induce immunogenicity more
effectively rather than conventional inactivation procedures (Seo 2015). Also, we applied the
vaccine candidate (OZG-38.61.3) using the intradermal route in mice which decreased the
requirement of a higher concentration of inactivated virus for proper immunization unlike most of
the classical inactivated vaccine treatments (Lambert and Laurent 2008; Hickling et al. 2011).
Different variations in SARS-CoV-2 strains may occur when producing large quantities (bulk) of
the virus in a laboratory (Zhang et al. 2019). For this reason, 50% of the unit volume of virus
isolates cultured in multi-layered flasks was frozen in each passage. While preparing the final
product (OZG-38.61.3), frozen raw intermediate products were pooled. Thus, pre-pooling genomic
characterization of individual variants between passages was made and the final product was
created for a more effective and safer vaccine design. At the end of the vaccine production, the
final product was found to contain most of the defined mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 strain. In
addition, the SARS-CoV-2 virus was passaged 3 times for the isolation from the first donor and 6
times for the final production of OZG-38.61.3. The genome analysis of the OZG-38.61.3 vaccine
in this study was found to retain >%99.5 homology with the starting virus stock isolated from the
COVID-19 patient. This may enable our inactive virus vaccine to be effective in a large population.

Zeta-sizer along with Nanosight size analysis, proteome, and electron microscopic data showed
that the OZG-38.61.3 vaccine preserved its compact structure despite gamma irradiation and
lyophilization. However, we also detected aggregate formation, especially in electron microscope
images. We added human serum albumin (<0.02%) to the final product to increase the stability, to
prevent viral particles from adhering to the injection vial walls, and efficacy of the vaccine
candidate (Prymula et al. 2016). Assessment of the residual Vero host cell protein and DNA level
in each vaccine dose in this study showed that the protein level was <4ng and DNA was absent in
the dose. This showed us that the vaccine production process is efficiently pure from the residual
products.
In this study, we generated a prototype gamma-irradiated inactive SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (OZG38.61.3) and assessed protective efficacy against the intranasal SARS-CoV-2 challenge in
transgenic human ACE2 encoding mice. We demonstrate vaccine protection with substantial ~3
log10 reductions in mean viral loads in dose 1014 immunized mice compared with non-vaccinated
infected positive control mice. We showed humoral and cellular immune responses against the
SARS-CoV-2, including the neutralizing antibodies similar to those shown in Balb/c mice, without
substantial toxicity. This study will lead to the initiation of the Phase 1 clinical application of the
vaccine for the COVID-19 pandemic.
When we performed the efficacy and safety test of the final product, OZG-38.61.3, vaccine
candidate on Balb/ c mice at two different doses (1013 and 1014), the presence of SARS-CoV-2
specific neutralizing antibodies was significantly detected in the highest-dose vaccination (1014).
However, at both dose groups, significant IFN secretion from the spleen T cells were detected in
comparison with the controls, illustrating that cellular immune response developed earlier than the
humoral immune response. The fact that the neutralizing test was more accurate than the IgG

ELISA analysis may be due to the increased levels of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgA and IgM
antibodies (Woo et al. 2004; Demers-Mathieu et al. 2020; Poland, Ovsyannikova, and Kennedy
2020). Moreover, mice vaccinated with both doses showing a significant increase in T cell IFN
responses and Th1 dominant cytokine release is an additional evidence of vaccine efficacy. As no
significant toxicity was encountered in the histopathological analysis of Balb/c mice vaccinated
with both doses, decision was taken to proceed to the challenge test.
A difficulty was faced with the intradermal vaccination of mice in that some of the study mice had
skin injury due to the vaccination. This factor may have possibly reduced the efficacy of the
intradermal vaccine tests and may be the reason behind the finding of a high standard deviation
and inability to see a parallel neutralization capacity in each mouse.
In the Challenge test, we collected oropharyngeal samples to determine the viral copy number
following the administration of intranasal infective SARS-CoV-2 virus. In unvaccinated but virusinfected positive control mice viral copy numbers at 48 and 96 hours either did not change or they
were increased. However, in the groups of mice vaccinated with both doses, findings showed that
copy numbers effectively decreased around 3 log10, and even a few mice had completely lost the
viral load. X-rays were performed to search for similar effect in the lung lobes, but the classic
COVID-19 infection image was not observed in any of the groups. Also qRT-PCR studies and
histopathological lung analyses did not reveal pathological changes in the lung tissues. This may
have been either due to the short 96-hour infection period, or low amount of virus (30,000 TCID50)
used in the 96-hour challenge test might not have been sufficient to descend into the lungs during
this period. There are also previous reports regarding the absence of viral load in the lung tissue
being due to the amount of infected dose or the virus could be detected in the specific locations of
the lung (Subbarao et al. 2004; Gao et al. 2020b). When neutralizing antibody capacity of mice

vaccinated in the Challenge test was analyzed, both doses of vaccination were observed to
significantly neutralize the SARS-CoV-2. This is in accordance with the previous finding of
reduction in viral copy numbers in immunized mice.
When we looked at the neutralizing antibody capacity of mice vaccinated within the scope of the
Challenge test, we observed that both doses of vaccination could significantly neutralize SARSCoV-2. This shows us that the reduction in viral copy rates is consistent. However, when we looked
at the T cell response, we could not see any difference in IFN release. Presumably, because groups
of mice are infected with the virus, T cells may already be stimulated and this may not make a
difference in IFN release. A significant decrease in CD3+ and CD4+ T cell ratios and an increase
in CD25+ CD4+ T cell ratio show that these cells have already been activated. On the other hand,
the fact that the virus was neutralized here prevented the increase in CD3+ T cell proportion,
therefore viral challenge resulted in only the increase of active T cell. When we looked at spleen T
cells that were not re-stimulated, we detected Th1-type cytokine release, as we expected, especially
in the 1014 dose vaccine group. On the other hand, the significant increase in the ratios of total
CD3+ and CD4+ T cells and the ratios of activated (CD25+) CD8+ T cells and the level of the Th1
cytokine and inhibitor IL-10 between the negative control and positive control mice that had an
only viral infection. It shows that in a short time such as 96 hours, it started to generate T cell
response more effectively than antibody response. This has shown that T cell response occurs in
individuals exposed to the virus without sufficient time for neutralizing antibody formation.
In summary, this study demonstrated that the OZG-38.61.3 vaccine candidates created with
gamma-irradiated inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viruses produced neutralizing antibodies, especially
effective in the 1014 viral copy formulation, and this was effective in protecting transgenic human
ACE2 expressing mice agianst SARS-CoV-2 virus. Vaccine candidates were demonstrated to be
