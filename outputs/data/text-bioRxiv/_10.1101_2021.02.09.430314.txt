Abstract
Olfaction relies on a coordinated partnership between odorant flow and neuronal communication. Disruption in
our ability to detect odors, or anosmia, has emerged as a hallmark symptom of infection with SARS-CoV-2, yet
the mechanism behind this abrupt sensory deficit remains elusive. Here, using molecular evaluation of human
olfactory epithelium (OE) from subjects succumbing to COVID-19 and a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2
infection, we discovered widespread downregulation of olfactory receptors (ORs) as well as key components of
their signaling pathway. OR downregulation likely represents a non-cell autonomous effect, since SARS-CoV-2
detection in OSNs is extremely rare both in human and hamster OEs. A likely explanation for the reduction of
OR transcription is the striking reorganization of nuclear architecture observed in the OSN lineage, which disrupts
multi-chromosomal compartments regulating OR expression in humans and hamsters. Our experiments uncover
a novel molecular mechanism by which a virus with a very selective tropism can elicit persistent transcriptional
changes in cells that evade it, contributing to the severity of COVID-19.
Main Text
Anosmia and hyposmia, complete and partial smell loss, respectively, constitute frequent and defining
symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infections 1-5. Although olfactory deficits are common among patients with upper
respiratory infections, these symptoms are typically accompanied by rhinorrhea and nasal congestion that result
in reduced airflow through the nasal cavity and physical insulation of olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) cilia from
volatile chemicals. In contrast, anosmia in COVID-19 appears to be independent from conductive interference,
as patients consistently deny associated nasal obstructive symptoms. These observations have prompted the
acceptance of anosmia as a key symptom in identifying potential cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection4, especially in
otherwise asymptomatic patients. Yet, the emerging link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and anosmia raises
important mechanistic questions related to the molecular features of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs).
Specifically, OSNs do not express Ace2 and Tmprss26-8, receptors essential for host cell entry by the virus. Thus,
the virus may infect OSNs though a different set of extracellular host receptors, or the reported anosmia represents
a non-cell autonomous effect5,9. Distinguishing between the two models has immense importance: the former
implies that the olfactory epithelium (OE) could constitute a virus gateway to the CNS, through the OSN axons;
while the latter could provide insight to the non-cell autonomous consequences of COVID-19 infection, currently
considered the cause of severe complications and death.
To obtain a molecular understanding of the mechanisms contributing to COVID-19 induced anosmia, we
performed RNA-seq analysis on olfactory epithelia obtained from 19 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 3 control subjects
at time of death, in order to establish the transcriptional baseline of the human OE. These specimens were obtained
from critically ill patients at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, prior to the groundswell support for the
inclusion of smell and taste loss as essential symptoms. Thus, information on the concomitant presence of anosmia
exists only for one patient who self-reported profound smell and taste loss at the onset of symptoms. Based on
current projections of the prevalence of smell loss among COVID-19 patients, 40-70% of these subjects may have
experienced abrupt olfactory deficits5,10. Without a priori knowledge of olfactory deficits linked to our specimens,
we sought to identify the region of nasal mucosa most highly enriched for OSNs, focusing on the olfactory cleft,
a region at the roof of the nasal cavity bridging the superior septum and middle turbinate bones (Extended Data
Fig.1a). OE from this region contains high concentration of OSNs as demonstrated by detection of the mature
OSN-specific olfactory marker protein (OMP) and the OSN-enriched LDB1 and confirmed by scRNA-seq
(Extended Data Fig.1b, c). Thus, the analysis presented thereafter utilizes microdissections of this particular
region of the nasal epithelium. The consistency of this approach in regards of OSN representation is demonstrated
by plotting the levels of 30 OSN-specific markers, which were previously identified from mouse scRNA-seq
experiments, across the 22 autopsies, revealing comparable representation between samples (Extended Data Fig.
1d).
Upon establishing conditions for extraction of human OE with consistent cellular representation, we asked
if the viral RNA genome is detectable in infected samples by RNA-seq. Indeed, we detect the SARS-CoV-2 RNA

genome in all the OEs from infected patients, but not in control OEs (Fig.1a). There is strong variability in the
abundance of the viral genome between samples, with autopsies obtained less than 10 days after symptom
manifestation demonstrating elevated viral loads at higher frequency (Fig.1b). To determine the identity of the
infected cells, we performed fluorescent in situ RNA hybridization (RNA FISH) by RNA-scope using a probe for
the negative strand of the Spike gene, which detects only the replicating virus. Labeling is sparse across the human
OE and concentrated predominantly at the lamina propria and to a lesser degree at the most apical layer occupied
by sustentacular cells (Fig.1c-e). Some fluorescent signal is detected at the OSN layer, however, there is no
significant difference in the OSN staining patterns between control and SARS-CoV-2 infected OEs (Fig.1c-e),
suggesting non-specific hybridization. Finally, it should be noted that the same RNA FISH probe used in infected
lung sections revealed frequent cellular infection in this tissue (Extended Data Fig. 2). Thus, our data suggest that
the virus predominantly replicates in non-neuronal cells of the nasal epithelium, consistent with the expression
patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS26-9.
Since COVID-19 does not appear to infect OSNs, at least at a frequency that would account for the
prevalence of olfactory deficits, we asked if the virus exerts its effects by influencing expression programs of
specific cell types of the OE. Using previously described cell type specific markers (Extended Data Fig. 3a), we
discovered that viral infection alters specifically the expression of mature OSNs (mOSNs) (Fig. 2a), the cell type
responsible for detecting odors and for transmitting this information to the brain. Reduction of mOSN markers,
however, does not stem from an increase in apoptotic markers in the infected OEs (Fig.2b). Moreover, not every
mOSN marker is downregulated; genes with crucial role in OR signaling (Adcy311, Cnga212, Gng1313), and
trafficking of ORs and Adcy3 (Rtp114, Gfy15, respectively), are significantly downregulated in infected OEs (Fig,
2c, Extended Data Fig. 3a), whereas other mOSN-specific markers are not affected (Extended Data Fig. 3a).
These observations prompted us to also explore the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in expression of the actual
chemoreceptors per se. Strikingly, cumulative analysis of the total OR mRNA, shows that most infected OEs
express significantly less OR mRNA than the three control samples (Fig. 2c, d). Infected OEs not only express
less total OR mRNA, but also have lower complexity in the OR transcriptome, with 116 ORs being undetectable
in most SARS-CoV-2+ samples (Fig. 2e). The age of the human subject does not appear to be a critical determinant
of the expression properties of ORs and their signaling components (Extended Data Fig. 3b), refuting a bias in
our analysis due to the increased death rates among older COVID-19 patients. Intriguingly, we do not detect a
correlation between the total viral load at the human OE and the transcriptional effects on chemoreceptor
pathways (Extended Data Fig. 3c), which is consistent with a non-cell autonomous process. In this vein, we asked
if infected OEs exhibit excessive and prolonged pro-inflammatory responses, which have been reported
systemically for patients with severe symptoms and could explain the reported olfactory deficits16-18.
Surprisingly, we do not evidence for extreme or maladaptive anti-viral responses originating at the OE (Extended
Data Fig. 3d), however we cannot exclude the systemic contribution of cytokines, or that such responses have
been terminated in the OE by the time the patients succumbed. In support of the latter, the few samples collected
within two days from the first symptoms tend to have elevated immune responses compared to samples with
longer intervals (Extended Data Fig. 3e).
To obtain independent confirmation for the SARS-CoV-2 induced downregulation of ORs and OR
signaling molecules, and to explore early stages of infection, we performed experiments in golden hamsters (M.
auratus). This rodent species is considered a good animal model for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to high sequence
homology between hamster and human ACE2, and similarity in pathogenesis and immunological responses19-22.
We performed a time course experiment that allowed us to monitor transcriptional changes in hamster OE, 1, 2,
and 4 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection. As expected, we detect significantly higher viral loads in the hamster
OEs compared to human epithelial specimens (Fig. 3a) due to the direct viral delivery into the hamster nasal
cavities. Despite the high viral load, cellular infection in the hamster OE is infrequent, based on the
immunoreactivity of the Nucleocapsid protein (NP) (Fig. 3b). Moreover, there is low correlation between NP and
OMP immunoreactivity (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Figure 4a, b), consistent with our observations in human OE.
Importantly, we do not detect NP in OSN axon bundles (Extended Data Fig. 4a, b) refuting the possibility that
SARS-CoV-2 invades the CNS through the olfactory system. Consistent with the preferential non-neuronal

tropism of SARS-CoV-2, we detect significant downregulation of sustentacular-specific markers from the earliest
stages of infection (Fig.3d, Extended Data Fig. 4c). At later stages we also detect downregulation of markers
specific for OSNs and their immediate precursors (Fig.3d, Extended Data Fig. 4c). Further, as previously
reported23, we observe areas of restricted tissue damage (data not shown), coinciding with a weak, non-significant
increase of apoptotic markers at 4dpi (Extended Data Fig. 4d). At this timepoint markers of the quiescent stem
cells of the OE (Horizontal Basal Cells, HBCs) become upregulated (Extended Data Fig. 4c), suggesting that
local tissue damage induced by high viral titers activates replenishment of Sus and OSN by HBCs. Reflecting the
elevated viral titers at this acute infection timepoint, SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits strong inflammatory responses
in hamster OE, beginning day 1 post infection (Fig. 3e). By day 4, there is a trend of dampening response,
consistent with trends observed in human OE specimens. Importantly, there is strong and significant
transcriptional downregulation of ORs and their signaling components, detected even by day 1 post infection (Fig.
3f, Extended Data Fig.4c). The kinetics and magnitude of transcriptional downregulation is not homogeneous
across ORs; class I ORs, ~100 OR genes that are differentially regulated from the >1000 class II ORs, demonstrate
slower and weaker downregulation than class II ORs (Fig. 3g). Notably, the same trend is observed in human
OEs (Extended Data Fig.4e), suggesting that conserved differences in the regulation of these two OR subfamilies
are responsible for the differential sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Because only class II OR gene expression depends on interchromosomal genomic compartments24-26, we
asked if COVID-19 infection of the OE impacts the OSN nuclear architecture. To answer this, we established a
protocol for the isolation of human and hamster OSN nuclei from crosslinked OE specimens by FACS (Extended
Data Fig. 5a, b). In situ HiC on human OSN nuclei from two control and 4 SARS-CoV-2 infected OE samples
revealed reduced genomic compartmentalization upon viral infection (Fig. 4a). Similarly, in hamsters, 3 days post
SARS-CoV-2 inoculation (3dpi), there is a strong reduction in the number of predicted genomic compartments
in OSN nuclei from infected OE, compared to controls (Fig. 4b). To increase the genomic resolution of our
analysis towards identification of changes on specific compartments, we pooled the 2 control and 2 infected
human OE specimens that are most distinct from each other. At a genome wide level, reduced genomic
compartmentalization may be explained by an overall decrease on the frequency of specific genomic interactions
and an increase of background interactions across all chromosomes, a result that is recapitulated in both humans
and hamsters (Extended Data Fig. 5c, d). Crucially, we observe significant reduction in long-range cis and trans
genomic interactions between OR gene clusters in both species upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 4c-f).
Quantification of genomewide trans genomic interactions composing OR-containing compartments, reveals
strong and significant reduction in infected OEs from both species (Fig. 4g, h). Intriguingly, Adcy3, Gng13, and
Gfy, together with Omp, Lhx2 and Atf5, which are also downregulated in infected human OEs form a separate
interchromosomal compartment that also dissipates upon infection (Extended Data Fig. 6). Thus, the dramatic
reorganization of nuclear architecture induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection does not only affect directly ORs, but
also other genes that are essential for odor detection. Importantly, because we FAC-sorted nuclei with high levels
of LHX2 and ATF5 proteins, disruption of genomic compartmentalization is likely the cause and not the
consequence of Lhx2 and Atf5 downregulation, transcription factors that are critical for the expression of ORs
and of their signaling molecules.
Our experiments reveal a molecular explanation for SARS-CoV-2 induced anosmia and uncover a novel
mechanism by which this virus can alter the identity and function of host cells that lack entry receptors. Consistent
with the previously reported absence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 from OSNs, our data suggest that OSN infection
by SARS-CoV-2 is too infrequent to account for the reported smell loss and the widespread downregulation of
ORs and their signaling molecules. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 infects OSNs
via interactions with Neuropilin-127, our data do not support that viral replication in OSNs and transmission via
their axons to the olfactory bulb27,28, as a cause of anosmia. The simplest explanation for the widespread olfactory
deficits is a non-cell autonomous process, which may be mediated by the early onset induction of cytokines by
the infected cells29. A direct consequence of this process is the dramatic reorganization of OSN nuclear
architecture and dissipation of genomic compartments (Fig. 5). Nuclear reorganization deprives OSNs from the
ability to detect odorants and to transmit this information to the brain, as both ORs and OR signaling molecules

depend on these interchromosomal contacts for their expression. Given that most animals use olfaction for social
communication, a virus induced loss of smell may limit social interactions of the infected individuals with their
conspecifics30, limiting transmission within their social group. On the other hand, this process may reflect a viral
effort to evade innate immunological responses since mammalian cells deploy interchromosomal contacts to
activate antiviral programs31. Since adult CNS neurons also assemble long-range cis and trans genomic
compartments32,33, this adaptive process may eventually induce long-lasting changes in brain nuclear architecture
explaining cognitive and neurological deficiencies linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection34. Finally, it is worth noting
that the realization that different OR sub-families exhibit differential sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 infection, could
eventually be deployed towards the development of rapid, COVID-19 specific smell-based screening tools.

A model for the non-cell autonomous induction of anosmia by SARS-CoV2 infection. In control samples (left)
silent ORs form a genomic compartment (blue) that promotes assembly of a multi-enhancer hub (red), which
activates transcription of a single OR allele. Moreover, a second compartment consisted of numerous genes
necessary for transcription, trafficking, and signaling of OR proteins is identified in control OSNs. Upon SARSCoV2 infection (right), sustentacular cells or cells from the lamina propria elicit signals that induce disruption of
genomic compartments and intermingling of genes that are supposed to be spatially segregated. Alternative, this
disruption may be induced by elevated systemic cytokines circulating in COVID-19 patients. In either case,
disruption of genomic compartmentalization results in downregulation of ORs and of their proteins involved in
trafficking and OR signaling, resulting in anosmia.

Extended Data: Methods
Human samples: Patients previously diagnosed with COVID-19 by clinical symptoms or SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR
analysis, underwent full body autopsy at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (New York, NY, USA) upon
death. The study was approved by the ethics and Institutional Review Board of Columbia University Medical
Center (IRB AAAT0689, AAAS7370). Specimens noted to have metastatic cancer and those exceeding a postmortem time of 24 hours were excluded from subsequent analysis. Brain tissue and nasal epithelium, including
the olfactory region, were retrieved under a collaborative effort by the Department of Neuropathology and the
Department of Otolaryngology. Tissues were obtained and preserved for histological, molecular, and microscopic
evaluation using separate surgical instruments to prevent cross-contamination. Control specimens were collected
in similar fashion from deceased individuals who had no clinical history of COVID-19 and had negative SARSCoV-2 PCR at the time of their presentation and again prior to post-mortem dissection. Nasal tissues, including
olfactory and respiratory epithelium were harvested from the skull base using an en-bloc resection of the anterior
skull base including the cribriform plate. Olfactory epithelium was isolated from the olfactory cleft, spanning
turbinate and adjacent septal mucosa prior to being preserved in 1% paraformaldehyde (for HiC), 4%
paraformaldehyde (for RNA ISH/IF), or Trizol (for RNA-seq).
Hamsters: LVG Golden Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) were treated and euthanized in compliance with
the rules and regulations of IACUC under protocol number PROTO202000113-20-0743. Only male hamsters
were used for experiments. All experiments were performed on dissected olfactory epithelium tissue or on
dissociated cells prepared from whole olfactory epithelium tissue. Dissociated cells were prepared using papain
(Worthington Biochemical) and FAC-sorted as previously described.
Virus stock and propagation: Infectious work was performed at a CDC/USDA-approved BSL-3 facility at the
Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. SARS-CoV-2 (clinical isolate UAS/WA1/2020) virus was propagated
in Vero E6 cells in DMEM supplemented with 0.35% BSA. Infectious titer of virus was determined by plaque
assay in Vero E6 cells using an overlay of Modified Eagle Medium (Gibco), 0.2%BSA (MP Biomedicals), 4mM
L-glutamine (Gibco), 10mM HEPES (Fisher Scientific), 0.12% NaHCO3, 1% heat-inactivated FBS, and 0.7%
Oxoid agar (Thermo Scientific). SARS-CoV-2 virus stocks used for hamster experiments were passage 3.
SARS-CoV-2 inoculation: All hamster infections were performed in a BSL-3 animal facility at the Center for
Comparative Medicine and Surgery at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (New York, NY) using 4-6week-old male golden hamsters purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Hamsters were intraperitonially
administered anesthesia of ketamine/xylazine (3:1), [100mg/kg] before inoculation. Inoculations were performed
by intranasally administering 100 plaque-forming units (pfu) in a total volume of 100ul per hamster, diluted in
PBS. Golden hamsters were provided thermal support after infection until recovery from anesthesia. Before
sacrifice, the animals were anesthetized and then perfused with 60mL of PBS through the heart.

RNA-seq. RNA was extracted using Direct-zol RNA kits from Zymo Research. 50ng-1ug of total RNA was used
to prepare DNA libraries with Truseq RNA Library Prep Kit v2 followed by 75 HO paired-end and multiplexed
sequencing. Reads were aligned to human genome (hg38), Mesocricetus auratus (MesAur1.0) and SARS-CoV2 (wuhCor1) using Subread and the raw read counts were assembled using featureCounts pipeline. Deseq2 was
used to detect differences between conditions from the human samples and from the hamster biological replicates.
For control samples we performed PCA analysis to remove outliers in an unsupervised fashion; two samples were
not clustering with the rest and were removed, however Padj values for differences in OR, Adcy3, Gng13, Gfy
and Cnga2 remain significant even if we keep these samples in our analysis (data not shown).
Single cell RNA-seq. Cells were dissociated according to the Worthington Papain Dissociation System by
incubating fresh olfactory tissue with papain and Calcein VIolet for 40 min at 37 °C. Following dissociation, the
live Calcein Violet-positive cells were sorted and assayed for scRNA-seq. Library preparation was performed
accordingly to Chromium Single Cell 3ʹ v.3 Protocol and sequenced on NextSeq. Cell Ranger pipelines were used
to generate fastq files which subsequently were aligned against hg38. All the cells with less than 1000 genes and
less than 2000 UMIs per cell were discarded, resulting in 6828 cells used for analysis. Clustering was performed
using Seurat with filtering default of a gene being expressed in at least 3 cells to include in data. To identify each
of cell populations, previously annotated in lab olfactory epithelium markers were used to highlight olfactory
lineages on tSNE plot.
RNAscope in hOE. Dissected tissue was fixed in freshly prepared 4% PFA for 24 hrs at 4C and soaked
sequentially at 10%, 20% and 30% sucrose 1X PBS for cryopreservation. The tissue was embedded in OCT and
10 um thick sections were mounted on SUPERFROS Plus Gold slides. To detect the S gene transcripts of
SarsCov2, RNAscope® Probe - V-nCoV2019-S-sense, cat# 845708, was incubated for 2 hr at 40C, in pre-treated
sections as indicated by the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescenct v2 Assay kit. Zeiss Zen2012 SP1 (v8.1.9.484)
was used for capturing confocal images. Autofluorescence of the human OE sections was computationally
removed using the ImageJ add-on function described in Baharlou et al35.
Immunofluorescence. Dissected tissue was fixed in freshly prepared 4% PFA for 24 hrs at 4C. OE was
embedded in OCT and coronal cryosections were collected at a thickness of 12 μm. Antigen retrieval was
performed with 0.01M citric acid buffer (pH 6.0) for 10 minutes at 99C. Sections were rinsed in PBS and after
permeabilization with 1x PBS 0.1% Triton X 100, slides were incubated in blocking solution (4% donkey serum
+5% nonfat dry milk + 4% BSA + 0.1% Triton X-100) for 30 minutes at RT. Tissue sections were stained with
primary antibodies against OMP36 (1:100 dilution) and NP (1:200 dilution, MyBiosource Cat. no.#
MBS8574840). DNA was labelled with DAPI (2.5 μg/ml, Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat. no.# D3571). Primary
antibodies were labelled with the following secondary antibodies: for OMP, anti-chicken IgG conjugated to
Alexa-488 (2 μg/ml, Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat. no.# A-11055, RRID:AB_2534102), for NP, anti-rabbit IgG
conjugated to Alexa-555 (2 μg/ml, Thermo Fisher Scientific Cat. no.# A-31572, RRID:AB_162543). Confocal
images were collected with a Zeiss LSM 700 and image processing was carried out with Fiji (NIH).
Fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting: Frozen 1% PFA-fixed tissue was mechanically crushed using Covaris
Impactor and then nuclei were extracted with OptiPrep Density Gradient Medium according to the Sigma
Millipore protocol. Following extraction and filtering two times through a 35-µm cell strainer, nuclei were stained
with Lhx2/Atf5 antibodies for human samples and Lhx2/OMP antibodies for hamster respectively. Next
DAPI/Lhx2/Atf5 and DAPI/Lhx2/OMP triple positive nuclei were sorted on a BD Aria II or BD Influx cell sorter
for HiC experiments.
In situ Hi-C: Depending on the sample, between 30 thousand and 100 thousand nuclei were used for in situ HiC. Sorted nuclei were lysed and processed through an in situ Hi-C protocol as previously described with a few
modifications. In brief, cells were lysed with 10 mM Tris pH 8 0.2% Igepal, 10 mM NaCl. Pelleted intact nuclei
were then resuspended in 0.5% SDS and incubated for 20 min at 62 °C for nuclear permeabilization. After being
quenched with 1.1% Triton-X for 10 min at 37 °C, nuclei were digested with 25 U/µl MseI in 1× CutSmart buffer

for 1.5 hours at 37 °C. Following digestion, the restriction enzyme was inactivated at 62 °C for 20 min. For the
45-min fill-in at 37 °C, biotinylated dUTP was used instead of dATP to increase ligation efficiency. Ligation was
performed at 25 °C for 30 min with rotation after which nuclei were centrifuges. To degrade proteins and revers
crosslinks pellets were incubated overnight at 75 °C with proteinase K. Each sample was transferred to Pre-Slit
Snap-Cap glass mictoTUBE and sonicated on a Covaris S220 for 90 sec (‘Harsh shear’ program).
Hi-C library preparation and sequencing: Sonicated DNA was purified with 2× Ampure beads following the
standard protocol and eluted in 300 µl water. Biotinylated fragments were enriched as previously described using
Dynabeads MyOne Strepavidin T1 beads. The biotinylated DNA fragments were prepared for next-generation
sequencing directly on the beads by using the Nugen Ovation Ultralow kit protocol as described [Kevin/Adan
paper]. DNA was amplified by 7 cycles of PCR. Beads were reclaimed and amplified unbiotinylated DNA
fragments were purified with 1× Ampure beads. The quality and concentration of libraries were assessed using
Agilent Bioanalyzer and Qubit Quantification Kit. Hi-C libraries were sequenced paired-end on NextSeq 500
(2 × 75 bp), or NovaSeq 6000 (2 × 50 bp).
Hi-C data processing and analysis: Raw fastq files were processed using the Juicer single CPU BETA version
on AWS. Human data were aligned against hg19 and hamster reads were aligned to MesAur1.0_HiC.fasta.gz
using BWA 0.7.17 mem algorithm. Hamster genome assembly was obtained from the DNA Zoo Consortium37.
After reads are aligned, merged, and sorted, chimaeras are de-duplicated and finally Hi-C contact matrices are
generated by binning at various resolutions and matrix balancing. In this paper we present data with stringent
cutoff of MAPQ >30. Hi-C matrices used in this paper were matrix-balanced using Juicer’s built-in Knight-Ruiz
(KR) algorithm. Matrices were visualized using Juicebox38. Cumulative interchromosomal contacts at the 50 kb
resolution were constructed by calling Juicer Tools dump to extract genome wide normalized data from a .hic file
and subsequently analyzed as previously described24. A hidden Markov model (HMM) was used to assess the
presence of genomic compartments as previously described24. Using 2–21 components, HMMs are constructed
for odd versus even chromosomes and a score is calculated using hmmlearn’s built-in score to ascertain the
likelihood of the given number of compartments. The same was done for even versus odd after transposing the
matrix.
