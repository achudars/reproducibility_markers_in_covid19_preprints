Summary
Emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, from the UK and South Africa,
respectively show decreased neutralization by monoclonal antibodies and convalescent or
vaccinee sera raised against the original wild-type virus, and are thus of clinical concern.
However, the neutralization potency of two antibodies, 1-57 and 2-7, which target the receptorbinding domain (RBD) of spike, was unaffected by these emerging strains. Here, we report cryoEM structures of 1-57 and 2-7 in complex with spike, revealing each of these antibodies to
utilize a distinct mechanism to bypass or accommodate RBD mutations. Notably, each antibody
represented a response with recognition distinct from those of frequent antibody classes.
Moreover, many epitope residues recognized by 1-57 and 2-7 were outside hotspots of
evolutionary pressure for both ACE2 binding and neutralizing antibody escape. We suggest the
therapeutic use of antibodies like 1-57 and 2-7, which target less prevalent epitopes, could
ameliorate issues of monoclonal antibody escape.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent for
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged in 2019, rapidly establishing an ongoing
worldwide pandemic with over 100 million infected and over two million dead at the current
time (Callaway et al., 2020; Cucinotta and Vanelli, 2020; Dong et al., 2020). The possible
emergence of mutant strains of SARS-CoV-2 with improved transmissibility, virulence, or
ability to evade human immunity has been a major concern (Baric, 2020). The SARS-CoV-2
lineage known as B.1.1.7 emerged in September 2020 in South East England, quickly becoming
the dominant variant in the UK, and subsequently spreading to over 50 countries, potentially due
to enhanced transmissibility (Andrew Rambaut et al., 2020). The B.1.1.7 strain contains the early
spike mutation D614G, now common to most SARS-CoV-2 lineages, as well as eight additional
spike mutations including two deletions (69-70del & 144del) in the N-terminal domain (NTD), a
single mutation (N501Y) in receptor-binding domain (RBD) and (A570D) in SD1, two
mutations (P681H and T716I) near the furin cleavage site, and two mutations in S2 (S982A and
D1118H). Another emerging lineage, SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351, appeared late in 2020 in Eastern
Cape, South Africa (SA) (Tegally et al., 2020), and also become dominant locally, again raising
the possibility of increased transmissibility. B.1.351 contains 9 spike mutations in addition to
D614G, including a cluster of mutations (e.g., 242-244del & R246I) in NTD, one mutation
(A701V) near the furin cleavage site, and three mutations (K417N, E484K, & N501Y) in RBD.
Recent studies have shown that some of these new variants impede the function of some
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, with most NTD-directed neutralizing antibodies showing a
near complete loss of potency against either the B.1.351 or B.1.1.7 strains (Wang et al., 2021;
Wibmer et al., 2021). With respect to RBD-directed antibodies, however, while the most

prevalent classes of multi-donor RBD-directed antibodies, originating from the VH3-53/66 and
VH1-2 genes (Banach et al., 2021; Rapp et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2020) are generally inhibited
by mutations in RBD (K417N and N501Y for VH3-53/66 class antibodies and E484K for VH1-2
class antibodies) (Wang et al., 2021). Fortunately, many RBD-directed antibodies not from these
frequent classes retain their activity.
In a companion manuscript (Wang et al., 2021), we screened monoclonal antibodies and
found two super potent RBD-directed antibodies, 1-57 and 2-7 (0.008 and 0.003 μg/mL of live
virus neutralization IC50 for 1-57 and 2-7, respectively), whose neutralization was unaffected by
the emerging B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 strains. To understand how these antibodies accommodate the
mutations present in B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 strains, we determined their cryo-EM structures in
complex with spike. We used the 52 currently known complex structures of RBD-directed
neutralizing antibody to create a residue-level map of antibody recognition frequency. This
analysis suggested mutations in RBD to emerge under evolutionary pressure from both antibodyescape and binding to the ACE2 receptor on host cells. We suggest that neutralizing antibodies
such as 1-57 and 2-7 that target epitopes with few selection hotspots may result in less viral
escape and lead to more effective therapeutic strategies.

Results
Antibody 1-57 utilizes a hydrophilic pocket to accommodate mutation E484K in emerging
strains.
From complexes of SARS-CoV-2 spike - stabilized by 2P mutations (Wrapp et al., 2020)
- with the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of antibody 1-57, we collected single particle data on a
Titan Krios microscope, yielding a cryo-EM reconstruction to an overall resolution of 3.42 Å

(Figure 1A, Figures S1 and S2, Table S1). A single conformational state with three Fabs per
trimer, each bound to an RBD in the ‘down’ conformation, was identified. Recognition of RBD
by 1-57 was dominated by the heavy chain, which buried 533.7 Å2 surface area, with a smaller
223.3 Å2 contribution by the light chain. The 21 amino acid-long CDR H3 formed a β-hairpin
stabilized by a disulfide bond between Cys100a and Cys100f, provided the primary interactions
with RBD, with additional contributions from CDR L1 and L2 (Figure 1C, left panel). CDR H3
formed mainly hydrophobic contacts with RBD residues Tyr351, Leu452, Phe490 and Leu492.
The light chain contributed to RBD recognition mainly through hydrogen bonds formed between
the hydroxyl groups of Ser30, Tyr32 and Ser53 in CDR L1 and L2 and residues Gln493, Ser494
and Gln498 in RBD respectively (Figure 1C, right panel). Antibody 1-57 also displayed a small
quaternary interaction, as Asn100c on the tip of CDR H3 hydrogen bonds with both Thr470 in a
neighboring RBD and glycan N165 in a neighboring NTD (Figure 1C, middle panel).
With respect to the three RBD mutations in the UK and South Africa strains, only residue
E484K of the South African strain was near the binding site of 1-57 (Figure 1B). Despite its
proximity to the epitope, however, Glu484 did not interact significantly with 1-57, as the amino
acids in the immediate vicinity – Val100e from the heavy chain, and Ser29 and Ser93 from the
light chain – were too distant (Figure 1D, left panel). Structural modeling of the E484K
mutation showed that a Lys residue was geometrically compatible with 1-57 binding; modelling
of K484 with a high frequency rotamer showed that the distance between the amino group of
K484 and the side chain of Ser29 was compatible with a hydrogen bond (2.81 Å) (Figure 1D,
right panel).

Structural basis of antibody 2-7 accommodation of mutation N501Y in emerging strains.
Cryo-EM analysis of the Fab from antibody 2-7 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike
produced a reconstruction with 3 Fabs bound to a single spike, and was refined to an overall
resolution of 3.72 Å (Figure 2A, Figures S1 and S3, Table S1). Only one conformation was
observed, with Fabs bound to two RBDs in the ‘up’ conformation and one in the ‘down’
conformation. Due to extensive conformational heterogeneity, the ‘up’ RBDs could not be
resolved to high resolution, thus the ‘down’ RBD was the focus of structural analysis.
Recognition of RBD by antibody 2-7 was dominated by interactions proximal to the RBD
loops formed by residues 438-451 and 495-502 (Figure 2C, left panel). CDR H2 formed an
extensive network of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges (Figure 2C, middle panel). RBD residue
Lys444 formed salt bridges with Fab heavy chain residues Asp56 and Asp54. Additionally, CDR
H2 residues Asp54, Tyr52, and Arg58 formed hydrogen bonds with RBD residues Asn450, the
backbone amine of Val445, and the backbone carbonyl of Gly447, respectively. Val445 at the
apex of loop 438-451 was at the center of a hydrophobic pocket that included Pro499 on RBD
that accommodated several residues on the heavy chain (Trp47, Leu50, Tyr52, and Ile97) and
one on the light chain (Tyr91). Light chain residue Tyr32 also formed a hydrogen bond with the
RBD via residue N440 (Figure 2C, right panel).
With respect to the three mutated positions in the UK and South Africa variants, antibody
2-7 bound near only N501, but the sidechain of N501 pointed away from the antibody (Figure
2B and Figure 2D). While some conformational change of the 495-502 loop would be expected
in the context of the N501Y mutation, this loop contributed only 225 Å2 out of 736 Å2 and
contained few residues that form significant interactions with the Fab.

Genetic and epitope similarities to other SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies
The heavy chain of 1-57 derived from the VH3-72*01 gene with a CDR H3 of 21amino
acids, and the light chain was from KV3-20*01, with a 9 residue CDR L3 (Figure S3). Antibody
2-7 utilized VH2-5*02 with an 11 amino acid CDR H3, and LV2-14*01 with a 9 residue CDR
L3. Both antibodies thus utilized heavy chain genes with relatively low frequencies in SARSCoV-2 specific neutralizing antibody repertoire (Rapp et al., 2021), suggesting that antibodies
with genetic features similar to 1-57 and 2-7 may not appear frequently in human response to
SARS-CoV-2.
To understand whether the binding orientations of antibodies 2-7 and 1-57 were common
among RBD-directed antibodies, we superposed structures of RBDs from the 52 RBD-directed
antibody complex structures deposited in the PDB and measured root mean square deviations
(RMSD) between antibodies. Overall, clustering of the 52 antibodies using pairwise RMSD
showed that antibodies 1-57 and 2-7 did not cluster with the most frequent VH3-53 and VH1-2
antibody classes (Figure 3A). Antibody 2-7 was grouped with REGN10987, which was a
component of a SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic cocktail (Hansen et al., 2020). The binding orientation
of antibody 1-57 was similar to antibodies P2B-2F6 and CV07-270. However, these antibodies
utilize paratopes different from 2-7 and 1-57 for RBD recognition, probably because each
antibody has a unique genetic origin.
During in vivo viral infection, epitopes frequently targeted by antibody may impose
strong selection pressure for viral escape. We used the 52 neutralizing antibodies in the PDB to
estimate the frequencies of the epitopes of 1-57 and 2-7 being recognized by assuming that these
antibodies recapitulate in vivo recognition frequencies of RBD epitopes. Briefly, for each
antibody, we identified epitope residues and calculated the frequency of each RBD residue being

recognized by antibody. The analysis revealed that the epitope residues of 1-57 and 2-7 showed
lower antibody recognition frequencies (about 11.2 and 19.8 antibodies per residue in average
for 2-7 and 1-57, respectively) compared to those targeted by the prevalent antibody classes
(about 27.4 and 25.9 antibodies per residue in average for VH1-2 and VH3-53 class,
respectively, Figure 3B), suggesting that 1-57 and 2-7 epitopes are relatively less targeted
antigenic sites.

Antibody escape mutations may result from ACE2-binding and antibody-escape selection
pressure.
Analysis of RBD mutations observed in circulating SARS-CoV-2 sequences revealed
many emerging mutations (Figure 4A). To understand whether the emerging mutations affect
antibodies 1-57 and 2-7 recognition, we analyzed structural locations of the top 10 most frequent
RBD mutations. We found that while antibodies 1-57 and 2-7 are not affected by the three
mutations observed in the UK and SA strains, several RBD mutations may affect antibodies 1-57
and 2-7. For example, mutations at position 452 and 494 were within the antibody 1-57 binding
footprint (Figure 4B). Mutations at position 439 may affect 2-7 binding. However, further
experiments will be required to assess such effects.
Studies have proposed that many SARS-CoV-2 escape mutations are selected by
neutralizing antibodies (Baum et al., 2020; Ku et al., 2021). However, it is unclear whether the
observed antibody resistant mutations are all the results of antibody selection. To shed light on
this, we calculated correlation between positional mutation frequency and antibody recognition
frequency by assuming that the estimated per RBD residue targeting frequency reflects in vivo
frequency of antibody recognition and that the most frequently targeted RBD residues may

undergo strong selection pressure to mutate. To our surprise, we only observed a very weak
correlation (Figure 4C, r = 0.23, p = 0.1) albeit some of the most frequently targeted residues do
have higher mutation frequencies. Because RBD is always under selection pressure from ACE2
binding for entry (Starr et al., 2020), we next examined whether the emerging RBD mutations
were selected by enhancing ACE2 binding. We calculated the correlation between frequencies of
RBD mutations and their normalized effects on ACE2 binding affinity obtained from deep
mutational scanning data (Starr et al., 2020), which showed a significant correlation (Figure 4D,
Pearson’s r = 0.34, p = 0.015). The correlation coefficient could be further increased
significantly when removing two ‘outlier’ mutations, K417N and F486L, both of which reduce
ACE2 binding affinity significantly (Figure 4D). Further analysis of the antibody escape
mutations showed that the frequent antibody escape mutations we observed may arise from
selection advantage for both ACE2 binding and antibody escape. For example, the most frequent
N501Y could improve the binding affinity of ACE2 as well as impair recognition of the most
frequent VH3-53 class antibodies (Wang et al., 2021). The E484K mutation – detected in
B.1.351 and recently emerging strains P.1 and P.2 (Nuno R. Faria et al., 2021) – impairs
recognition of numerous antibodies and also weakly improves ACE2 binding affinity. However,
the frequent mutation K417N, resulted in escape of the prevalent VH3-53 derived antibody class
(Wang et al., 2021), and may be selected predominantly by antibody pressure. Despite the ability
of 5-7 and 2-17 to still potently neutralize emerging strains that carry N501Y, K417N and
E484K mutation, we observed that individual mutations at 452, 494, and 439 (Figure 4B)– may
affect 1-57 and 2-7 recognition - do not or only weakly enhance ACE2 binding (Starr et al.,
2020). Thus, these mutations may not be selected by ACE2 binding enhancement, but further

experiments are required to understand whether combinations of these individual mutations
could have beneficial advantage.
Our analysis suggests that potent antibodies 2-7 and 1-57 may not put much selection
pressure on circulating strains, thus resistance mutants to these two antibodies are less likely to
arise. Overall, due to the diversity of emerging strains, different antibody cocktails become more
and more important, and 2-7 and 1-57 are decent candidates for therapeutic development.

Discussion
The emergence of mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains and their impact on the function of
neutralizing antibodies has become a major concern. The B.1.1.7 (UK) and B.1.351 (South
Africa) variants contain mutations that evade the most frequently elicited classes of RBDdirected neutralizing antibodies from the VH1-2 (B.1.351) and VH3-53/66 classes (B.1.1.7) (Ku
et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021). Both antibody classes recognize predominantly the RBM, which
is mutated convergently in many emerging viral lineages (e.g. K417T, E484K, and N501Y in
both B.1.351 and B.1.1.28 (Brazil)). In this study, we report the structures and accommodation
mechanisms for two potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, 1-57 and 2-7, which are not
impaired by the mutations in the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 lineages.
Quantifying epitope-targeting frequency is important for understanding mechanisms of
antibody induced viral escape. Despite an algorithm having been developed to estimate linear
epitope-targeting frequency by serum antibodies in a high-throughput way (Shrock et al., 2020),
it is still difficult to measure the epitope-targeting frequency of antibodies recognizing three
dimensional epitopes. Methods such as competition ELISA can only reveal frequencies of
targeted epitope regions with no residue-level information. Here we use a method to roughly

estimate residue-level frequencies for antibody recognition of RBD based on the 52 currently
known atomic-level structures of neutralizing antibody-RBD complexes. These antibodies,
identified in separate studies of infected donors from around the world (Barnes et al., 2020;
Hansen et al., 2020; Lv et al., 2020; Pinto et al., 2020) were generally chosen for study due to
their neutralization potency. Overall, these studies identified antibodies mainly targeting RBD
(Brouwer et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Tortorici et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020), with some NTDdirected neutralizers (Cerutti et al., 2021; Chi et al., 2020), with antibodies of the same class
often identified in multiple studies. The residue-level antibody-interaction frequencies we
present for RBD are likely to represent a reasonable estimate of relative frequencies, but only for
the most potent and most frequent classes. Thus, the calculated residue-level antibody-interaction
frequency may not reflect epitope-targeting frequencies of weakly- or non-neutralizing
antibodies, which are a significant portion of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 (Liu et al.,
2020; Robbiani et al., 2020). It is also unclear whether weakly- or non-neutralizing antibodies
impose selection pressure on RBD epitopes. Therefore, the weak correlation between antibodyinteraction frequency and mutation frequency could be due to multiple confounding factors not
included. Nonetheless, many of the identified antibody-interaction hotspots are within or close to
the ACE2 binding site. Linear-peptide epitopes around these hotspots are also recognized by
numerous serum antibodies (Shrock et al., 2020), confirming that the hotspots we identified are
frequently targeted.
The study of mechanisms of mutant accommodation by antibodies 1-57 and 2-7 shed
insights on effective therapeutic strategies. Studies have shown that persistent SARS-CoV-2
infection can last for months in immunocompromised human individuals (Avanzato et al., 2020;
Choi et al., 2020). During such a long acute infection period, the arm race between the immune

system and virus results in many viral mutations to be accumulated in spike to escape antibody
neutralization. Because the human neutralizing antibody response frequently and convergently
targets the ACE2 receptor-binding region on RBD, there is strong positive selection pressure to
mutate this region. In the meantime, our results showed that the most frequent mutations tend to
enhance ACE2 binding, suggesting additional selection pressure underlying SARS-CoV-2
evolution. Because most RBD mutations are detrimental to ACE2 binding (Starr et al., 2020), the
virus may have a limited mutation space for escaping antibody neutralization. This may explain
the rapid spread of convergent RBD mutations in different emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages (e.g.
E484K mutation in Brazilian P.1, SA B.1.351, and US B.1.526 lineages) (Sabino et al., 2021;
West et al., 2021). For therapeutics, antibodies that can either tolerate mutations in the ACE2binding region or recognize epitopes outside this region are critical for protection. Here, 1-57 and
2-7 bind epitopes that are not predominantly focused on the ACE2-binding region and also
accommodate RBD mutations. A residue-level interaction-frequency analysis of RBD interaction
with all currently known RBD-directed neutralizing antibodies of structure revealed them to
represent relatively low frequency antibody response, which may not form strong selection
pressure on the epitope regions. Therapeutics developed from such neutralizing antibodies could
lead to persistent protection for a longer period of time.

Materials and Methods

SARS-CoV-2 spike expression and purification
SARS-CoV-2 S2P spike was produced as described in (Wrapp et al., 2020). Protein expression
was carried out in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 Freestyle cells (Invitrogen) in
suspension culture using serum-free media (Invitrogen) by transient transfection using
polyethyleneimine (Polysciences). Cell growths were harvested four days after transfection, and
the secreted protein was purified from supernatant by nickel affinity chromatography using NiNTA IMAC Sepharose 6 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare) followed by size exclusion
chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in 10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH
7.4.

Production of 1-57 and 2-7 Fab
Monoclonal antibody 1-57 was expressed and purified as Fab: VHCH1 with a C-terminal His-tag
(His8) and LC were constructed separately into the gWiz expression vector, and then cotransfected and expressed in Expi293. Five days after transfection, supernatants were harvested
and 1-57 Fab was purified by nickel affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA agarose (Invitrogen
cat. No R901-15).
Monoclonal antibody 2-7 was expressed and purified as described in (Liu et al., 2020). Fab
fragment was produced by digestion of IgG with immobilized papain at 37 °C for 3 hrs in 50
mM phosphate buffer, 120 mM NaCl, 30 mM cysteine, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7. The resulting Fab
was purified from Fc by affinity chromatography on protein A.

Fab purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE; all Fabs were buffer-exchanged into 10 mM Tris, 150
mM, pH 7.4 for cryo-EM experiments.

Cryo-EM samples preparation
The final sample for EM analysis of the 1-57 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 S2P spike was
produced by mixing the Fab and spike in a 1:9 molar ratio, with a final trimer concentration of
0.33 mg/mL, followed by incubation on ice for 1 hr. The final buffer was 10 mM sodium acetate,
150 mM NaCl, 0.005% (w/v) n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside, pH 4.5. Cryo-EM grids were prepared
by applying 2 µL of sample to a freshly glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grid (CF 1.2/1.3
300 mesh); the sample was vitrified in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV with a wait time
of 30 s and a blot time of 3 s.
The final sample for EM analysis of Fab 2-7 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 S2P spike was
produced by mixing the Fab and spike in a 1:9 molar ratio, with a final trimer concentration of
0.66 mg/mL, followed by incubation on ice for 1 hr. The final puffer was 10 mM sodium acetate,
150 mM NaCl, 0.005% (w/v) n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside, pH 5.5. Cryo-EM grids were prepared
by applying 2 µL of sample to a freshly plasma-cleaned carbon-coated copper grid (CF 1.2/1.3
300 mesh); the sample was vitrified in liquid ethane using a Leica EMGP with a wait time of 15
s and a blot time of 1.5 s.

Cryo-EM data collection, processing and structure refinement
For 1-57, cryo-EM data were collected using the Leginon software (Suloway et al., 2005)
installed on a Titan Krios electron microscope operating at 300 kV, equipped with a Gatan K3BioQuantum direct detection device. The total dose was fractionated for 3 s over 60 raw frames.

Motion correction, CTF estimation, particle extraction, 2D classification, ab initio model
generation, 3D refinements and local resolution estimation for all datasets were carried out in
cryoSPARC 2.15 (Punjani et al., 2017); particles were picked using Topaz (Bepler et al., 2019).
The final 3D reconstruction was obtained using non-uniform refinement with C3 symmetry.
SARS CoV-2 S2P spike density was modeled using PDB entry 7L2E (Cerutti et al., 2021), as
initial template. The initial model for 1-57 Fab variable region was obtained using the SAbPred
server (Dunbar et al., 2016).
For 2-7, cryo-EM data were collected as described for 1-57, except that the total electron flux
was fractionated over 2 s with 40 total frames. Data processing was also performed as described
above. The final reconstruction was obtained using non-uniform refinement with C1 symmetry,
followed by local refinement of the ‘down’ RBD and Fab. The SARS-CoV-2 S2P spike density
was modeled using PDB entry 6XEY (Liu et al. 2020) as an initial template. A homology model
for the 2-7 Fab variable region was obtained using Schrodinger Release 2020-2: BioLuminate
(Zhu et al., 2014).
Automated and manual model building were iteratively performed using real space refinement in
Phenix (Adams et al., 2004) and Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) respectively. For 2-7,
ISOLDE v1.1 (Croll, 2018) was also used to interactively refine the structure. Half maps were
provided to Resolve Cryo-EM tool in Phenix to support manual model building. Geometry
validation and structure quality assessment were performed using EMRinger (Barad et al., 2015)
and Molprobity (Davis et al., 2004). Map-fitting cross correlation (Fit-in-Map tool) and figures
preparation were carried out using PyMOL and UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) and
Chimera X (Pettersen et al., 2021). A summary of the cryo-EM data collection, reconstruction
and refinement statistics is shown in Table S1.

Clustering of published RBD-directed antibodies
Information of published SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were obtained from CoV-AbDab
database (Raybould et al., 2020), the structure for each antibody was download from PBD. For
each pair of antibodies, the RBDs were superimposed and the RMSD of Cα between antibody
variable domains were calculated. The heavy and light chain sequence alignment were
performed using the online muscle program included in bio3d package (Grant et al., 2006).
RMSD of Ca were then calculated based on the sequence alignment by an in-house python script,
clustering of the RMSD matrix was performed by hclust package in R.

Calculation of antibody targeting frequency for RBD
The epitope RBD-directed antibodies were determined by PISA with the default parameters
(Krissinel and Henrick, 2007), the RBD residues with non-zero BSA value were considering as
epitope residue. For each residue on RBD, the number of contact antibodies was counted as the
frequency of antibody recognition. The antibody targeting frequency was set as b factor of RBD
and displayed by Pymol 2.3.2 (DeLano, 2002).

Calculation of positional mutation frequency and correlations
The positional mutation frequency were calculated based on the SARS-CoV2 spike sequences
deposited in GISAID at Jan 23rd, 2021 (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017). Briefly, spike
sequences were aligned pairwise with Wuhan-Hu-01 strain as reference, the mutation frequency
for each position were calculated as the total mutations divided by total number of deposited
sequences, the low quality ‘X’ residue were not counted as mutations. Normalized effects on

ACE2 binding affinity for each mutation on RBD were download from the source data (Starr et
al., 2020). The r value and p value for correlations were calculated by cor.test function in R 4.0.3.

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

The statistical analyses for the pseudovirus neutralization assessments were performed using
GraphPad Prism. The SPR data were fitted using Biacore Evaluation Software. Cryo-EM data
were processed and analyzed using cryoSPARC. Cryo-EM and crystallographic structural
statistics were analyzed using Phenix, Molprobity, EMringer and Chimera. The correlations were
performed in R. Statistical details of experiments are described in Method Details or figure
legends.

Figure 2. Structural basis of antibody 2-7 accommodation of mutation N501Y in emerging strains.
(A) Cryo-EM reconstruction for spike complex with antibody 2-7 from two orthogonal views; a single conformation with 1 RBD down
and two RBDs up is observed. NTD is shown in orange, RBD in green, glycans in red, antibody heavy chain in magenta and
light chain in gray.
(B) Domain level view of 2-7 in complex with RBD, with the emerging mutants highlighted in red.
(C) Details of antibody 2-7 recognition of RBD showing the overall interface (left panel), recognition by CDR H2 (middle panel) and
recognition by CDR L1 and L3 (right panel). CDR H1, H2, H3 are colored in shades of magenta; CDR L1, L2, and L3 are
colored in shades of gray. N501 is highlighted in bright red (right panel).
(D) Expanded view of the N501 environment at the interface with 2-7 (left panel) and modeling of Y501 (right panel) suggest a
mechanism of antibody 2-7 accommodation of the N501Y mutation; colored as in (B).

Figure 3. Antibodies 1-57 and 2-7 exemplify rare responses, suggesting that mutations against these antibodies have low
selection pressure.
(A) Analysis of 52 known RBD-directed neutralizing antibodies indicates that 1-57 and 2-7 approach RBD with angles distinct from
prevalent antibody classes.
(B) Per residue frequency recognized by 52 known RBD-directed antibodies. VH1-2 and VH3-53/66 antibody classes recognize
RBD residues with high targeting frequency. 1-57 and 2-7 recognize RBD residues with low targeting frequencies.
