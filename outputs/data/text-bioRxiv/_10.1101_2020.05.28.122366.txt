Abstract
RNA viruses are proficient at switching to novel host species due to their fast mutation rates.
Implicit in this assumption is the need to evolve adaptations in the new host species to exploit
their cells efficiently. However, SARS-CoV-2 has required no significant adaptation to humans
since the pandemic began, with no observed selective sweeps to date. Here we contrast the
role of positive selection and recombination in the Sarbecoviruses in horseshoe bats to SARSCoV-2 evolution in humans. While methods can detect some evidence for positive selection in
SARS-CoV-2, we demonstrate these are mostly due to recombination and sequencing artefacts.
Purifying selection is also substantially weaker in SARS-CoV-2 than in the related bat
Sarbecoviruses. In comparison, our results show evidence for positive, specifically episodic
selection, acting on the bat virus lineage SARS-CoV-2 emerged from. This signature of
selection can also be observed among synonymous substitutions, for example, linked to
ancestral CpG depletion on this bat lineage. We show the bat virus RmYN02 has recombinant
CpG content in Spike pointing to coinfection and evolution in bats without involvement of other
species. Our results suggest the non-human progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 was capable of humanhuman transmission as a consequence of its natural evolution in bats.

Main text
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus emerged in the city of Wuhan, China, causing
coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) characterised by respiratory or gastrointestinal viral
symptoms, and in severe cases, additionally, acute respiratory distress syndrome,
cardiovascular dysfunction, thrombosis and other symptoms1. Evolutionary analysis placed this
new human virus in the same subgenus of Betacoronavirus, the Sarbecoviruses (Figure 1A),
that SARS emerged from2, and it was named SARS-CoV-23 – the seventh known humaninfecting member of the Coronaviridae. The initial outbreak of human cases of the virus was
connected to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan4, and while related viruses have
been found in horseshoe bats5 and pangolins6, their divergence represents decades of
evolution7 leaving the direct origin of the pandemic unknown. In addition to the importance of
understanding the route from animals to humans, key questions for assessing future risk of
emergence are: what is the extent of evolution required to permit a bat virus to transmit to
humans, and what subsequent evolution needs to occur for efficient transmission once the virus
is established within the human population?

While both the first SARS virus outbreak in 2002/2003, causing approximately 8,000 infections,
and a re-emergence in late 2003, causing four infections, were linked to Himalayan palm civets
and raccoon dogs in marketplaces in Guangdong province8,9, it became clear that these animals
were conduits for spillover to humans and not true viral reservoirs10. Extensive surveillance work
subsequently identified related viruses circulating in horseshoe bats in China some of which
can replicate readily in human cells11,12. The bat viruses most closely related to SARS-CoV-1
(red variants, Figure 1A), can use human ACE2, while the addition of protease is required for
the more divergent bat viruses tested (grey lineages, Figure 1A)13. Collectively these results
demonstrate that, unlike other RNA viruses that usually acquire adaptations after switching to a
new host species, the Sarbecoviruses – which already transmit frequently among bat species14
– can utilise this generalist property, facilitating successful infection of non-bat species,
including humans. We test this hypothesis by investigating the extent of positive selection (a
measure of molecular adaptation) in the virus circulating in humans since the COVID-19
outbreak began, and contrast this to historic selection acting on the related bat viruses.

The significance of mutation
There is intense interest in the mutations emerging in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic16–18. This is
important as, for example, Spike amino acid replacements could reduce the efficacy of vaccines

observable impact on virulence or transmission rates particularly when so many hosts are
susceptible as is the case for SARS-CoV-2. This is because many other factors determine
individual transmission rates and disease severity, and intraspecific variation in these factors
may dominate over variance across viruses.

Evidence of relatively weak purifying selection in SARS-CoV-2. We first analyse selection
acting on the encoded amino acids in 15537 genome sequences, a sample of the SARS-CoV-2
variants circulating in humans (also see Supplementary text 2). Purifying selection would be
expected to act more strongly on nonsynonymous sites, supported by the estimate that
nonsynonymous sites evolve at only 4% of the speed of synonymous sites in the wider
Sarbecovirus phylogeny7. We compared the relative frequencies of nonsynonymous and
synonymous mutations in the pandemic data and found that, after adjusting for the greater
number of nonsynonymous sites, there are fewer nonsynonymous mutations than synonymous
across at all frequency intervals (Figure 2). This depletion of nonsynonymous mutations across
all frequencies indicates that selection is filtering out nonsynonymous mutations before they are
observed by sequencing of the viral population. The vast majority of observed mutations occur
at low frequency, with only ~10% of mutations observed in more than six of the 15537
sequences (Figure 2). Nonsynonymous mutations appear to spread into the highest frequency
categories less frequently, suggesting that selection is additionally suppressing amino acid
replacements observed in the population, i.e., purifying selection is the overwhelming signal in
the pandemic.

As observed in other virus outbreaks mutation rate estimates of related coronaviruses appear to
decline with increasing sampling time7,22. This is because mildly deleterious mutations in viral
outbreaks fail to persist over longer time periods, being gradually purged by purifying
selection23,24. This can be observed in the relatively suppressed frequency of nonsynonymous
mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (Figure 2). In addition, as worldwide suppression
strategies reduce the effective reproductive number (Rt) towards or below 1, it is likely that
many of the putatively deleterious segregating mutations, which are driving the initially elevated
nonsynonymous substitution rate, will be purged by purifying selection25, decreasing the
observed dN/dS values further.

greater proportion of susceptible tissues, causing competitive suppression of the second
infection, or have initiated an inhibitory immune response. Therefore, it is likely that
recombination rates scale non-linearly with prevalence and mostly occur only in very high
prevalence areas. It will be important to monitor for their occurrence as they could provide
additional mechanisms for novel genotypes to be generated once sufficient diversity exists in
the human population, or in the event of emergence of a third SARS-like coronavirus.

Importantly, as the SARS-CoV-2 sequence data continues to accumulate (recently surpassing
30,000 genomes in GISAID) the dominant evolutionary signal in the data is one of purifying
selection (see, http://hyphy.org/covid/).

What about in bats? Positive selection in Sarbecoviruses. Coronaviruses are known to
frequently recombine in their bat hosts, with the Spike open reading frame (ORF) being an
apparent hotspot for this process, which might have adaptive implications for the viruses in the
context of immune evasion10,30–33. We therefore separately tested each ORF of 69
Sarbecoviruses including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and their close relatives (Supplementary
table 2), and further separated the two longest ORFs, Orf1ab and Spike, into five putatively nonrecombinant regions each, based on Boni et al. (2020)7. We define as the ‘nCoV lineage’ the set
of viruses closest to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogeny (Figure 1A). These vary across genomic
regions according to the recombination patterns observed. The viruses that are present in every
definition of the lineage in this analysis are the following: SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, Pangolin-CoV
and the pangolin-infecting viral cluster: P2V, P5L, P1E, P5E and P4L. Genomic sites are
generally subject to conservation in this nCoV lineage, with 8184/9744 (84%) of codon sites
conserved at the amino-acid level, and 4274 (43.7%) sites, of which 3388 were variable at the
nucleotide level, showing evidence of purifying selection in this lineage (using the FEL
method34).
We sought evidence of episodic diversifying selection on the nCoV lineage using BUSTED[S]35,
coupled with a hidden Markov model (HMM) with three rate categories to describe site-specific
synonymous rate variation (SRV) and allow spatial autocorrelation in these rates36. Nonrecombinant regions of Orf1ab, Spike and ORF N show evidence of episodic diversifying
positive selection on the nCoV lineage (Figure 3). This finding is consistent with evidence of
positive selection operating on Orf1ab in MERS37, and Spike and N being essential for antigenic

recognition. Eighty five individual sites were inferred to evolve subject to episodic diversifying
selection in the nCoV lineage (Figure 3) using the MEME38 method.

We next looked for branch-specific evidence of selection in these flagged regions, using the
aBSREL method39. Our analysis found that diversifying selection left its imprints primarily at the
deepest branches of the nCoV lineage, with no evidence of selection in the terminal branch
leading to SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3). This is consistent with the non-human progenitor of SARSCoV-2 requiring little or no novel adaptation to successfully infect humans. Still, no model can
detect all signatures of historic genomic adaptation, and mutations which may enable SARSCoV-2 to infect humans could have arisen by genetic drift in the reservoir host.

The BUSTED[S] method also partitioned synonymous rate variation into three rate classes
across the sites. The majority of regions showed large, in some cases more than 20-fold,
differences between rate classes, with all three classes representing a substantial proportion of

sites for most regions (Supplementary figure 4), with varying degrees of spatial autocorrelation.
This suggests that strong purifying selection is acting on some synonymous sites (e.g.,
conserved motifs or RNA features), and some synonymous mutations in the SARS-CoV-2
genome may not be selectively neutral or occur at sites that are hypervariable. Some
synonymous rate variation may also be attributed to the 5’ and 3’ context-specific mutation rate
variation observed in SARS-CoV-222.

Patterns of CpG depletion in the nCoV lineage. Genome composition measures, such as
dinucleotide representation and codon usage can also be an informative tool for characterising
the host history of a virus40. Various host antiviral mechanisms accelerate the depletion of CpG
dinucleotides in virus genomes. This is thought to be primarily mediated either through selective
pressures by a CpG-targeting mechanism involving the Zinc finger Antiviral Protein (ZAP)41 or C
to U hypermutation by APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases42. These forces are likely to vary across
different tissues within a host and across different mammalian hosts. Thus, a smaller or greater
level of CpG depletion in particular viral lineages may be indicative of a switch in the
evolutionary environment of that lineage or its ancestors. Care must be taken to not overinterpret these results and conjure unsupported narratives (Pollock et al. 2020, under review).

We examined the CpG representation in Orf1ab of the Sarbecoviruses using the corrected
Synonymous Dinucleotide Usage (SDUc) measure, controlling for amino acid abundance and
single nucleotide composition bias in the sequences43. We find a downward shift in CpG
depletion levels at the base of the nCoV lineage, in comparison to the rest of the phylogeny
(Figure 4a-d). This may indicate a change of evolutionary environment, e.g., host or tissue
preference, since CpG depletion following host switches has been observed in other human
infecting RNA viruses, such as Influenza B40. Given the decades of divergence between SARSCoV-2 and the most closely related bat viruses7 could this evolution have occurred in a different
host species?
Zhou et al. (2020)44 report a novel bat-infecting Sarbecovirus sample, RmYN02, which
possesses the highest sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-2 of known Sarbecoviruses for most of
its genome. Yet, part of the RmYN02 Spike ORF is recombinant and is placed in the non-nCoV
clade of the Sarbecovirus phylogeny. This viral sequence offers an opportunity to test if the
recombination scenario was consistent with the lineage-specific CpG depletion patterns. A
sliding window of CpG relative dinucleotide abundance (RDA)45 shows that CpG levels of

SARS-CoV-2 and RmYN02 only differ at the recombinant region (Figure 4e). This is further
demonstrated when contrasting the SDUc values of the nCoV and non-nCoV parts of RmYN02
Spike to those of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 4f). The finding that RmYN02 is a recombinant between
the high and low CpG lineages suggests that viruses from both lineages are co-infecting the
same bat species. The CpG depletion is therefore probably not being driven by unique selection
or mutational pressures across lineages, but instead by a lineage-specific effect, such as
functional polymerase differences.

Conclusion. The evidence of positive selection on the nCoV lineage SARS-CoV-2 emerged
from – coupled with the change in CpG composition in this lineage and evidence primarily of
purifying selection in human circulating SARS-CoV-2 – indicates that the significant SARS-CoV2 evolution occurred prior to spillover into humans. The immediate ‘success’ of this bat virus in
several species following cross-species transmission supports the hypothesis that this is a viral
lineage with a relatively generalist nature (Figure 1B). We suggest that the early ancestors of
the nCoV lineage developed this generalist phenotype through a change in its evolutionary
environment (host switch, or tissue tropism) probably in bat species, allowing for multiple
spillover events to pangolins, and now humans, and potentially other wild mammals we have yet
to sample. While no evidence yet points to an intermediate host playing anything more than a
conduit role in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission to humans, there are still large gaps in our
knowledge of its recent non-human origins, as the closest bat viruses are relatively divergent in
time7. Recombination between a proximal ancestor of RmYN02 and a non-nCoV Sarbecovirus
is another indication that all the viruses in this subgenus co-circulate in bat reservoirs and
occasionally transmit to other mammals causing infection. In terms of controlling viral
emergence, we must dramatically ramp up surveillance at the human-animal interface.
Serological studies of communities in China that come into contact with bats indicate that
incidental and ’dead-end’ spillover of SARS-like viruses into humans do take place46,47. Due to
the high diversity of Sarbecoviruses and the generalist nature of these coronaviruses, a future
emergence is likely and could be sufficiently divergent to evade either natural or vaccineacquired immunity, as demonstrated for SARS-CoV-1 versus SARS-CoV-248. While gradual
‘antigenic drift’ could become an issue as the new virus diverges in the human population, it will
be important to monitor for abrupt ‘antigenic shifts’, e.g. those facilitated by recombination with
divergent Sarbecoviruses in the context of spillover events. Such events appear routine in bat
species and like it or not we are now part of the host range of these viruses.

SARS-CoV-2 GISAID sequence filtering. To reduce the impact of sequencing errors on
selection analysis the data from GISAID was filtered by excluding all sequences which meet any
of the following criteria: any sequence of length less than 29000 nucleotides or greater than

35000; any sequence with a non-human host, e.g., bat, pangolin; sequences from
environmental samples; any sequences marked with a warning flag, as having quality
issues on GISAID; any sequence with more than 30 unique (across the whole dataset)
single nucleotide mutations relative to the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence; and any
sequence which has a frameshifting deletion or insertion relative to the SARS-CoV-2
reference sequence.

SARS-CoV-2 positive selection. To search for signatures of positive selection in the
phylogenetic tree of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak we ran the Bayesian FUBAR software
from the HyPhy package27,28. This software searches for evidence of positive selection by
estimating phylogeny-wide ratios of nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dN) substitutions
rates for each site in the alignment. It estimates a posterior probability that each site is under
positive selection across the phylogeny (dN/dS >1), with a posterior probability>0.9 used as the
threshold for significance, as suggested by the authors. FUBAR was run using an alignment
exported from CoV-GLUE (http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/) on the 16th March 2020, using a tree
generated in RAxML49 under the GTR+Γ model.
SARS-CoV-2 recombination. As recombination is known to confound FUBAR, and other
methods in the HyPhy package, the maximum likelihood recombination detection software
GARD29 was used to test for recombination before using FUBAR. This software searches for
recombination by introducing potential breakpoints and optimising tree topologies either side of
the new breakpoint. If the Akaike information criterion (AIC)50 is improved by the optimisations
with breakpoints in, this provides significant evidence of recombination. If significant evidence of
recombination is found, the method can then generate multiple non-recombinant partitions in the
sequence alignment for use in downstream analyses. However, if the samples are highly
related, as in the SARS-CoV-2 dataset, this phylogeny-based approach is limited in power as
each recombination event introduces a large number of additional number of parameters,
substantially penalising the AIC50. To detect recombination with more power for closely related
samples, we also used the pairwise homoplasy index51, which tests for excessive homoplasies.

However, this method cannot tell if homoplasies are due to recombination or convergent
evolution through parallel adaptation due to shared selection pressures.

Sarbecoviruses alignment and recombination. To avoid the confounding effects of
recombination, we have analysed each open reading frame (ORF) separately, and divided the
Orf1ab and Spike ORFs into putative non-recombinant regions, based on the seven major
recombination breakpoints presented in Boni et al. (2020)7. This produces five non-recombinant
regions for Orf1ab (regions A to E) and five regions for Spike (regions A to D, and the variable
loop - region VL). The protein sequences of the non-recombinant regions SARS-CoV-2, SARSCoV-1 and 67 closely related viruses with non-human hosts (bats and pangolins) were aligned
using MAFFT version 7 (L-INS-i)52. Subsequent manual corrections were made on the protein
alignments and pal2nal53 was used to convert them to codon alignments. Phylogenies for each
codon alignment were inferred using RAxML with a GTR+Γ model49.
Sarbecovirus selection analysis. We used an array of selection detection methods to
examine whether the lineage leading to SARS-CoV-2 has experienced episodes of diversifying
positive selection. Each non-recombinant region was examined separately. We separated each
region’s phylogeny into an nCoV and non-nCoV/SARS-CoV-1 lineage. The nCoV lineage
includes SARS-CoV-2 and the viruses that it is phylogenetically most closely related to. These
are the bat-infecting CoVZC45, CoVZXC21, RmYN02 and RaTG13, and the pangolin-infecting
Pangolin-CoV and P2V, P5L, P1E, P5E, P4L cluster. Note, some recombinant regions of the
first three viruses do not belong to the nCoV lineage.

We tested for evidence of episodic diversifying selection on the internal branches of the nCoV
lineage using BUSTED[S], accounting for synonymous rate variation (SRV) as described in
Wisotsky et al. (2020)35. We developed an extension to BUSTED[S], that included a hidden
Markov model (HMM) with three rate categories to describe site-specific synonymous rate
variation (SRV)36. This HMM allows explicit incorporation of autocorrelation in synonymous rates
across codons. This autocorrelation would be expected if selection or mutation rate variation
were spatially localised within ORFs. The rate switching parameter between adjacent codons of
the HMM describes the extent of autocorrelation, with values under 1/N (N = number of rate
classes) suggestive of autocorrelation. Standard HMM techniques (e.g. the Viterbi path) applied
to these models can reveal where the switches between different rate types occur, thereby

partitioning the sequence into regions of weaker or stronger constraint on synonymous
substitutions.
aBSREL method39 was used on all branches of the nCoV lineage to determine which specific
branches drive the inference of selection. Finally, we examined which specific codon sites are
under negative selection on average over the nCOV lineage using FEL34, and under pervasive
or episodic diversifying positive selection on the nCoV lineage using MEME38. P-values of ≤0.05
for the likelihood ratio tests, specific to each method, were taken as evidence of statistical

genomes we developed a modified version of the Synonymous Dinucleotide Usage (SDU)
metric43, which now accounts for biased base composition. The original SDU metric compares
the observed proportion of synonymous CpG, o, for each pair of frame positions, h, in a coding
sequence to that expected under equal synonymous codon usage, e, for each amino acid (or
amino acid pair), i, that can have CpG containing codons (or codon pairs). The SDU metric is
the mean of these ratios weighted by the number of informative amino acids (or pairs), n, in the
sequence (Equation 1).

To incorporate the biased, and variable base composition of SARS-CoV-2 and other
Sarbecoviruses22, here we have estimated expected codon usage based on each virus’s wholegenome nucleotide composition. We term this new metric the corrected Synonymous
Dinucleotide Usage (SDUc). We use observed base frequencies from each virus to generate
the corrected null expectation of the metric, e’, instead of assuming equal usage, (Equation 1).
The expected proportion, e’, for every amino acid / amino acid pair was estimated by randomly
simulating codons based on the whole-genome single nucleotide proportions of each virus. This
e’ was then used for all SDUc calculations of the corresponding virus.

As this metric is susceptible to error when used for short coding sequences, we applied SDUc
on the longest ORF, Orf1ab, of all the viruses. To estimate the extent of phylogenetic
independence between synonymous sites across SDUc datapoints, we measured the pairwise
synonymous divergence (Ks) between viruses. Pairwise Ks values were calculated using the
seqinr R package54 which utilises the codon model of Li (1993)55, demonstrating the partial but

0.89 within the nCoV lineage, and 0.34 and 1.09 respectively within the non-nCoV lineage.

Spike recombination analysis. To determine the recombination breakpoint on the Spike ORF
of the RmYN02 virus we used the RDP5 method suite56, implementing seven methods: RDP,
GENECONV, Chimaera, MaxChi, BootScan, SiScan and 3seq. We first performed the analysis
on the whole-genome alignment of the Sarbecoviruses and then determined the relevant
breakpoint within the Spike ORF by rerunning the method on the Spike-only alignment. The
accepted breakpoint (position 24058 in the RmYN02 genome) was consistently called by six out
of the seven tested methods (RDP, GENECONV, Maxchi, Chimaeara, SiSscan, 3seq).
