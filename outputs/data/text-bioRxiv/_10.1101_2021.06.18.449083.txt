Abstract:

23

Recent efforts have reported numerous variants that influence SARS-CoV-2 viral

24

characteristics including pathogenicity, transmission rate and ability of detection by

25

molecular tests. Whole genome sequencing based on NGS technologies is the

26

method of choice to identify all viral variants; however, the resources needed to use

27

these techniques for a representative number of specimens remain limited in many

28

low and middle income countries. To decrease sequencing cost, we developed a

29

couple of primers allowing to generate partial sequences in the viral S gene allowing

30

rapid detection of numerous variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest

31

(VOIs); whole genome sequencing is then performed on a selection of viruses based

32

on partial sequencing results. Two hundred and one nasopharyngeal specimens

33

collected during the decreasing phase of a high transmission COVID-19 wave in

34

Tunisia were analyzed. The results reveal high genetic variability within the sequenced

35

fragment and allowed the detection of first introduction in the country of already known

36

VOCs and VOIs as well as others variants that have interesting genomic mutations

37

and need to be kept under surveillance.

38

Importance:

39

The method of choice for SARS-CoV-2 variants detection is whole genome

40

sequencing using NGS technologies. Resources for this technology remain limited in

41

many low and middle income countries where it is not possible to perform whole

42

genome sequencing for representative number of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases. In the

43

present work, we developed a novel strategy based on a first partial sanger screening

44

in the S gene including key mutations of the already known VOCs and VOIs for rapid

45

identification of these VOCs and VOIs and helps to better select specimens that need

46

to be sequenced by NGS technologies. The second step consisting in whole genome

47

sequencing allowed to have a holistic view of all variants within the selected viral

48

strains and confirmed the initial classification of the strains based on partial S gene

49

sequencing.

Introduction

58

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the

59

causative agent of human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was identified in

60

Wuhan-China in December 2019 (1, 2). The outbreak of the coronavirus disease

61

(COVID-19) rapidly spread worldwide; it was officially declared as pandemic by the

62

World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020 (3) and now represents a

63

tremendous threat globally.

64

SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded positive RNA virus, a member of the Beta

65

coronavirus genus that also contains SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The first sequence

66

of the virus was published in January 2020 (4). The structural genome region, located

67

in the 3’ part of the genome, encodes four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E),

68

membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) (5). The S protein forms a trimer on the surface

69

of the virion, it mediates virus attachment to the ACE-2 receptor and its entry to the

70

host cells (6). The S Protein is composed of two sub-units, S1 containing the receptor-

71

binding domain (RBD) and S2 that mediates membrane fusion (7). The S protein

72

determines SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and transmissibility and is also the major antigen

73

inducing protective immune response (8). Since the beginning of the COVID-19

74

pandemic, the S protein has been undergoing several mutations and it is highly

75

important to follow the emergence of these variants and their biological,

76

epidemiological and clinical significance. Early in the pandemic, variants of SARS-

77

CoV-2 containing a D to G substitution in the 614 amino-acid residue of the S protein

78

(D614G) were reported. This substitution increased receptor binding avidity and

79

D614G mutants became dominant in many geographic regions (9-11). In December

80

2020, the United Kingdom reported a variant of concern (VOC), referred as B.1.1.7,

81

with enhanced transmissibility within the population (12, 13). This variant became

82

predominant in the UK and spread to more than 100 countries in the world. In January

83

2021, two other VOCs, referred as B.1.351 and B1.1.28, also with high transmissibility,

84

were reported in South Africa and Brazil, respectively (14-16). Later, many other

85

variants, classified as Variants Under Investigation (VUIs) were reported throughout

86

the world. In addition to the increased transmissibility, it is suggested that some

87

mutations in these variants may affect the performance of some diagnostic real-time

88

PCR tests and reduce susceptibility to vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies (9, 10,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.18.449083; this version posted June 19, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

89

17-22). Global tracking of these newly identified VOCs and VUIs as well as any other

90

evolving SARS-CoV-2 variant, by genomic surveillance and rapid sharing of viral

91

genomic sequences, is highly recommended in order to limit their spread and control

92

the pandemic.

93

Nowadays, several classifications of SARS-Co V-2 strains in lineages or clades were

94

proposed. Indeed, two different lineages, A and B, were proposed by the Phylogenetic

95

Assignment of Named Global Outbreak (PANGO) lineage nomenclature, while a

96

classification in 11 different clades (19-A, 19-B, 20-A to 20-I) was proposed by the

97

Nextstrain resources and another classification in 9 clades (S, L, O, V, G, GH, GR,

98

GRY and GV) was proposed by GISAID.

99

In Tunisia, the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported on March 03, 2020

100

(23). The country experienced a first wave of the COVID disease and, through setting

101

up drastic nation-wide multi-sectoral measures to avoid international introduction of

102

the virus and its spread within the population, COVID-19 incidence decreased in May-

103

June 2020 to reach zero cases per day from the 4th to the 11th of June 2020. The

104

national strategy included early detection of imported cases, quarantining of new

105

confirmed cases as well as suspected cases and strict travel restrictions. After the

106

sharp decrease of the disease incidence; a relaxation in the application of these

107

measures by the general population, combined with decreased restrictions in

108

international transportation, led to the re-introduction of the virus again and the

109

establishment of a local transmission. In late July, COVID-19 incidence started to

110

increase again and the country experienced a second wave with highest incidence in

111

January 2021, associated with a high local transmission within the population. Starting

112

from February 2021, the disease incidence together with mortality rates decreased

113

again.

114

The present work reports the genomic features of SARS-CoV-2 sequences detected

115

in Tunisia during the late phase of the second wave of the pandemy and reveals the

116

co-circulation of several variants, some of which are already known as VOCs, others

117

have interesting genomic mutations and need to be kept under surveillance.

120

A total of 201 SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal samples, collected from

121

individuals living in the four districts of Tunis capital, were included in this study.

122

Sample collection was performed from January to March 2021, during the decreasing

123

phase of the second wave of COVID-19 outbreak in Tunisia (Figure1). The study

124

population includes symptomatic patients presenting with mild COVID clinical forms or

125

with severe forms as well as asymptomatic individuals sampled after a contact with

126

confirmed cases. The study population included 91 males and 110 females, their age

127

ranged from 5 to 98 years. The samples were collected by the health teams from the

128

Ministry of Health, at home for asymptomatic individuals and those with non-severe

129

clinical symptoms, or at the health facility level for hospitalized patients. Samples were

130

transported, refrigerated and within 24 hours, to the Pasteur Institute of Tunis where

131

they were immediately processed for SARS-CoV-2 detection by specific real time

132

reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) according to WHO

133

approved protocols (24, 25).

Primer design.

139

Primers were designed using PrimerDesign-M online software, available through

140

https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/PRIMER_DESIGN/primer_design.html

141

(26, 27), based on an alignment of 13451 SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences.

142

Several points were considered such as melting temperatures, G+C percentage,

143

entropy, complexity and nucleotide composition, in order to perfectly align with the

144

SARS-CoV-2 sequence. The selected primers sequences were as follows: IPT_FW:

145

(22964-22987) 5’-ATTTCAACTGAAATCTATCAGGCC-3’ and IPT_REV: (23666-

146

23647) 5’-CTGCACCAAGTGACATAGTG-3’. Indicated positions correspond to the

147

sequence of Wuhan reference strain (accession number: NC045512). The designed

148

primers allow the amplification of a 703-nucleotide-long region in the S gene holding

PCR amplification and sequencing in the S gene.

152

A volume of 140µl of nasopharyngeal samples was used for viral RNA extraction with

153

viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to give a final elution volume of 60µl of

154

total RNA. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was determined by conventional

155

reverse transcription PCR using the SuperScript®III One-Step RT-PCR System with

156

Platinum® Taq DNA Polymerase kit (Invitrogen) in a 25µl reaction volume containing

157

12.5µl of 2X buffer, 0.5µl Rnasin (Promega), 1µl of each reverse and forward primers

158

(10µM), 1µl Enzyme mix and 5µl of total extracted RNA. Optimized cycling conditions

159

was performed as follows: Reverse transcription with initial incubation at 50°C for

160

30min and 94°C for 2min followed by 35 cycles, repeating denaturation at 94°C for

161

15sec, annealing at 54°C for 45sec and elongation at 72°C for 30sec, and final

162

elongation at 72°C for 10min. Amplification products are first visualized by

163

electrophoresis in agarose gels and then purified by the ExoSAP-IT method using the

164

Exonuclease-I and the Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (Invitrogen). The purified

165

amplicons were sequenced using the Big Dye Terminators v3.1 kit (Applied

166

Biosystems) and the forward and reverse PCR primers. The resulting consensus

167

sequences were deduced by aligning the forward and the reverse sequence of each

168

isolate, excluding primer binding regions and are 618 nucleotides-long (positions

169

22988 to 23605 according to the Wuhan reference strain NC045512). They were

170

submitted to the NCBI database under accession number MZ150010 - MZ150210.

Whole genome sequencing.

172

The QIAseq SARS-CoV-2 Primer Panel paired with the QIAseq FX DNA Library

173

construction kits (Qiagen GmbH, Germany) were used for enriching and sequencing

174

the entire SARS-CoV-2 viral genome. Extracted RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs

175

was first depleted of ribosomal RNA using RiboZero rRNA removal Kit (Illumina, USA).

176

The residual RNA was then converted to double stranded cDNA using random

177

priming. Following cDNA synthesis, QIAseq SARS-CoV-2 Primer Panel kit was used

178

including high fidelity multiplex PCR reaction yielding 400bp amplicons covering the

179

full viral genome. The multiplexed amplicon pools were then converted to sequencing

libraries by enzymatic fragmentation with 250bp fragment size, end repair and ligation

181

to adapters with the QIAseq FX DNA Library construction kits. Thereafter, the

182

constructed DNA library was purified and adapter-dimers were removed with

183

Agencourt AMPure XP beads. The libraries were sequenced using Nextseq (Illumina

184

Inc, USA) to generate 2x150 bp paired-end sequencing reads.

185

Sequences' raw data have been processed using fastqc version 0.11.9 for quality

186

control

187

quality reads and adapters have been filtered using trimmomatic version 0.39 (28) with

188

a Phred quality score of 30 as threshold. Genome consensus sequences were

189

assembled by mapping on the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome of GenBank accession

190

number NC045512 (Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate) using Spades assembler version 3.15.0

191

(29), with thresholds of 80% for nucleotide sequence coverage and 90% for nucleotide

192

similarity. The obtained SARS-CoV-2 new sequences were submitted to the GISAID

193

database (https://www.gisaid.org) (30, 31) with the following accession numbers:

Phylogenetic analysis.

198

The obtained partial S gene sequences and selective whole genome sequences were

199

aligned together with representative SARS-CoV-2 reference sequences of the nine

200

recognized GISAID clades publically available in the GISAID database using MUSCLE

201

multiple sequence alignment algorithms (32) implemented in MEGAX (33).

202

Phylogenetic analyses were performed on nucleotide sequences using the maximum

203

likelihood method with the Tamura 3-parameter model then on amino acid sequences,

204

obtained from the aligned sequences, using the maximum likelihood method and the

205

Jones Taylor Thornton model. The tree topologies were supported by 1000 bootstrap

Results

213

Phylogenetic tree in Figure2 was performed based on the alignment of the 618-

214

nucleotides fragment in the S gene of the 201 studied Tunisian SARS-CoV-2 strains,

215

together with the 9 selected references SARS-CoV-2 sequences according to the

216

GISAD nomenclature. The tree topology shows that the Tunisian sequences are

217

divided into 3 different clusters. Cluster1, represented in purple color, includes the

218

highest number of sequences (174 out of 201, 86.5% of Tunisian strains) that clustered

219

with the 4 reference sequences of the GISAID Clades G, GH, GR and GV. The

220

phylogenetic distribution within this cluster shows several phylogenetic sub-branches

221

reflecting a large genetic variability. Cluster2 indicated in blue color comprises 15

222

identical sequences that clustered with the GISAID reference sequence from Clade

223

GRY. Cluster3, indicated in red color, contains 12 sequences that clustered with the

224

GISAID reference sequence from Clade S.

225

Eighteen representative samples from these clusters, indicated by a green square in

226

Figure2, were selected for whole genome sequencing: 13 from Cluster1, 2 from

227

Cluster2 and 3 from Cluster3. The phylogenetic tree of the obtained 18 whole genome

228

sequences, together with the 9 GISAID references SARS-CoV-2 sequences, is shown

229

in Figure3. The figure also shows the classification of the Tunisian sequences

230

according to the PANGO and the Nextstrain classifications. The phylogenetic

231

distribution of the sequences based on whole genome sequences (Figure3) is similar

232

to the one obtained in Figure2, based on the partial S gene genomic data.

233

The 13 sequences from Cluster1 highlighted in purple color in Figure2 grouped

234

together within PANGO B lineage in Figure3. The phylogenetic distribution of these

235

sequences clearly shows the presence of 3 sub-clusters called sub-cluster 1a, 1b and

236

1c classified as clade G/20A, GV/20A-C and GH/20C respectively according to the

237

GISAID/Nextstrain nomenclatures. Sub-cluster 1a is represented by only one

238

sequence (SP-0362), while Sub-cluster 1b and Sub-cluster 1c are represented by 4

239

(SP-0202, SP-0083, SP-0377 and SP-0036) and 8 (SP-0378, SP-0017, SP-0382, SP-

240

0210, SP-0084, SP-0089, SP-0055 and SP-0105) sequences respectively.

241

Two sequences from Cluster2 in Figure 2 were also found to cluster together with the

242

reference sequence of the GR GISAID Clade based on whole genome sequencing

243

comparison; the sequences also belong to the PANGO B lineage and to the 20B Clade

244

of the Nextstrain nomenclature.

245

Unlike the sequences from Cluster1 and Cluster2, the three whole genome sequences

246

from Cluster3 belong to the PANGO A lineage. They grouped together with the

247

reference sequence of the S GISAID Clade, similarly to the results obtained based on

248

the partial S sequences.

249

The amino acid sequences related to the 201 partial S sequences and the 18 whole

250

genome sequences were deduced from the obtained nucleotide sequences and

251

compared to the Wuhan reference protein sequences.

252

Table 1 shows the amino acid substitution profile in the sequenced fragment of the S

253

gene of the 201 samples investigated in the present study. Fourteen different mutation

254

profiles were found. Most of the sequences (147/174) had zero non synonymous

255

mutation as compared to the Wuhan reference, excepting the D614G which was found

256

in all the sequences from cluster 1 and Cluster 2. The remaining 27 sequences from

257

Cluster1 had 1 to 2 additional substitutions within the sequenced fragment (Table 1).

258

The 15 sequences from Cluster 2 shared an identical mutational profile with the amino

259

acid substitutions N501Y, A570D, D614G and P681H which are known to be

260

characteristic of the VOC B.1.1.7 initially detected in the UK. The 12 sequences from

261

Cluster did not have the D614G substitution but three mutations that suggest the VUI

262

A.27 (N501Y, A653V, Q655H); one sequence (SP-0347 which was in a separate

263

branch within the phylogenetic tree shown in Figure2), had an additional substitution

264

(Q677H).

265

Table2 shows the amino acid substitution profile along the whole genome of the 18

266

selected Tunisian SARS-CoV-2 and representative from the different clusters found

267

based on S partial sequences. The two sequences from Cluster 2 had identical

268

mutational profile in the S gene and a total of 23 and 24 amino acid substitution along

269

the whole genome; these results confirm the belonging of the two sequences to the

270

B1.1.7 lineage (VOC). The three sequences from Cluster 3 shared 15 identical amino

271

acid substitutions along the whole genome and the results confirm the belonging of

272

the three sequences to the A.27 lineage, identified as variant of interest (VOI) initially

273

detected in France. Among Cluster 1, one sequence (SP062 – Sub-Cluster 1a) had a

274

mutational profile that corresponds to the identified variant of interest (VOI) B.1.525

275

initially detected in Nigeria and in the UK. The sequences from Sub-Cluster 1c shared

276

several identical mutations in the non structural regions of the genome and belonged

277

to the B.1.160 lineage that is not presently identified as VOC or VOI. The same is for

278

the sequences from Sub-Cluster 1b that had more genetic diversity and belonged to

279

the B.1.177 lineage.

280

Discussion

281

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, several SARS-CoV-2 variants

282

emerged, some of them totally changed the infection epidemiology. First, a variant

283

with the D614G mutation emerged and became dominant globally (34). In our series,

284

this mutation is found in 186 out of the 201 isolates (92%). Other variants emerged

285

subsequently and it is now hypercritical to track the already known of them labelled as

286

VOCs or VOIs and also to monitor the emergence of new variants. The method of

287

choice is whole genome sequencing using NGS high throughput technologies which

288

improved considerably during the last years with a cost that declines continuously.

289

However, despite this progress, NGS is still expensive and resources for this

290

technology remain limited in many low and middle income countries where it is not

291

possible to perform whole genome sequencing for representative number of SARS-

292

CoV-2 positive cases. Thus, the use of other technologies to identify isolates that are

293

to be sequenced in priority is highly needed. Several real-time PCR tests that target

294

the already known VOCs, especially the B.1.1.7 (United Kingdom), B.1.351 (South

295

Africa) and B1.1.28 (Brazil) are now commercially available. They can be very useful

296

to rapidly identify the introduction of these VOCs to a country/region and to monitor

297

their transmission. However, these kits cannot detect other variants of interest that

298

already emerged, or that may emerge any time. Furthermore, other variants can be

299

characterized by the failure to detect the S gene in these tests, known as S gene target

300

failure (SGTF) (35).

301

In the present work, we developed a couple of primers allowing to generate a 618-

302

nucleotide-long sequence in the viral S gene that includes key mutations of the already

303

known VOCs and VOIs. Sequencing of this fragment by the traditional Sanger

304

technology allows rapid identification of these VOCs and VOIs and helps to better

305

select specimens that need to be sequenced by NGS technologies. Using this

306

approach, it is possible to detect 14 amino acid substitutions that have been identified

307

in several VOCs and VOIs (G482V, E484K, N501Y, A570D, D574Y, D614G, E619Q,

308

A626S, D627E, A653V, H655Y, Q675H, Q677H and P681H) and to get a rapid

309

orientation towards an already known or a new variant. In our series and using these

310

primers, we were able to detect the first introduction of the B.1.1.7 (VOC) and two

311

other VOIs (A.27 and B.1.525) and to select other viruses for WGS based on the

312

results obtained in the S partial genomic region. The second step consisting in whole

313

genome sequencing allowed to have a holistic view of all variants within the selected

314

viral strains and confirmed the initial classification of the strains based on partial S

315

gene sequencing.

316

The specimens included in the present work were collected in the decreasing phase

317

of a COVID-19 wave that occurred in Tunisia starting from September 2020 up to

318

January 2021. This period was characterized by a high transmission within the

319

population and this explains the high genetic diversity that we found in the obtained

320

sequences. Several lineages were identified and more than 100 different amino acid

321

changes, in comparison to the standard Wuhan strain, were identified all through the

322

viral genome.

323

During the study period, the first isolates of the VOC B.1.1.7, initially identified in the

324

UK, were detected. The sequenced isolates had the H69del, V70del, Y144del, N501Y,

325

A570D, D614G P681H, T716I, S982A, D1118H common amino acid substitutions with

326

the 20I/501Y.V1 (UK variant). Thus, it is highly expected that the genetic features

327

described herein will rapidly change to a lower genetic variability and a predominance

328

of the B.1.1.7 UK lineage. Indeed, this is what happened in most countries of the world

329

where the B.1.1.7 UK lineage was introduced causing devastating waves of COVID-

330

19 (36, 37). With its higher transmissibility within the human population, it becomes

331

rapidly predominant once introduced and this is also what is expected to happen in

332

Tunisia.

333

Furthermore, we were able to detect viruses belonging to the A.27 lineage, initially

334

detected in Danemark and now classified as VOI. This lineage was detected in around

335

26 different countries in the world, from Europe, Africa as well as USA and Australia.

336

Whole genome sequencing of three isolates in this series revealed the presence of

337

amino acid substitutions characteristic of this lineage, including L18F, L452R, N501Y,

338

A653V, H655Y, D796Y and G1219V and the absence of the D614G substitution in the

339

Spike protein. One strain (SP-0347) presented two additional substitutions: P26S that

340

is found in the P1 20J/501Y.V3 (Brazilian variant) and Q677H found in the Henri

341

Mondor variant detected in different regions of France (38).

342

We have also detected one sequence (SP062 – Sub-Cluster 1a) with a mutational

343

profile corresponding to the B.1.525, initially detected in Nigeria and in the UK. This

344

variant was detected in 48 different countries in the world at writing time and is

345

presently classified as VOI.

346

The rest of sequences from Sub-Clusters 1b and 1c belonged to the B.1.160 and

347

B.1.177 lineages that are not presently identified as VOCs or VOIs. These sequences

348

exhibit quite high genetic variability which is expected after the high active

349

transmission period that the country experienced in late 2020 and January 2021.

350

Among all these variants, some may then disappear and other may persist or even

351

dominate if they have a selective advantage in terms of virulence or transmissibility.

352

Conclusion

353

In conclusion, this study gives an overview of the SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in

354

Tunisia after a high transmission wave of COVID-19. Partial S gene sequencing

355

followed by whole genome sequencing of a selection of specimen was used to identify

356

the different circulating variants. This strategy may be of interest for several countries;

357

it helps to establish a genomic surveillance that is now highly needed in all regions of

358

the world, with a good cost/effectiveness ratio.

Figure1. Samples collection period investigated in the present study

572

The graph displays the number of cases and the number of deaths in Tunisia since

573

the declaration of the pandemy in March 2020. The Abscisse axe represents the

574

number of weeks from March 2020 till May 2021. Weeks highlighted in red color

575

represents the samples collection period investigated in the present study.

Figure2. Phylogenetic tree of 201 SARS-CoV-2 sequences based on partial S gene

577

nucleotide sequencing.

578

The phylogenetic tree includes 201 Tunisian sequences compared to 9 representative

579

reference sequences of SARS-Cov-2 Clades. The tree was performed using the

580

neighbor joining method and the Tamura 3-parameter (T92) model. Topology was

581

supported by 1000 bootstrap replicates. The sequences reported in this study are

582

shown in bold, and indicated by the laboratory code. The sequences downloaded from

583

GISAID are indicated by their accession number followed. Cluster 1 in purple color

584

denotes sequences presenting the D614G substitution and the lack of the amino acid

585

substitution N501Y. Cluster 2 in blue color includes sequences having the N501Y,

586

A570D, D614G and P681H substitutions. Cluster 3 in red color groups sequences with

587

the N501Y, A653V and H655Y substitutions and the lack of the amino acid substitution

588

D614G.
