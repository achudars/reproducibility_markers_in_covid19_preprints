ABSTRACT

25

The highly-transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants now replacing the first wave strain pose an

26

increased threat to human health by their ability, in some instances, to escape existing humoral

27

protection conferred by previous infection, neutralizing antibodies, and possibly vaccination.

28

Thus, other therapeutic options are necessary. One such therapeutic option that leverages SARS-

29

CoV-2 initiation of infection by binding of its spike receptor binding domain (S RBD) to surface-

30

expressed host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an ACE2 ‘decoy’ that would trap

31

the virus by competitive binding and thus inhibit propagation of infection. Here, we used

32

Molecular Dynamic (MD) simulations to predict ACE2 mutations that might increase its affinity

33

for S RBD and screened these candidates for binding affinity in vitro. A double mutant

34

ACE2(T27Y/H34A)-IgG1FC fusion protein was found to have very high affinity for S RBD and to

35

show greater neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 in a live virus assay as compared to wild type ACE2.

36

We further modified the double mutant ACE2 decoy by addition of an H374N mutation to inhibit

37

ACE2 enzymatic activity while maintaining high S RBD affinity. We then confirmed the potential

38

efficacy of our ACE2(T27Y/H34A/H374N)-IgG1FC Triple Decoy against S RBD expressing

39

variant-associated E484K, K417N, N501Y, and L452R mutations and found that our ACE2 Triple

40

Decoy not only maintains its high affinity for S RBD expressing these mutations, but shows

41

enhanced affinity for S RBD expressing the N501Y or L452R mutations and the highest affinity

42

for S RBD expressing both the E484K and N501Y mutations. The ACE2 Triple Decoy also

43

demonstrates the ability to compete with wild type ACE2 in the cPass™ surrogate virus

44

neutralization in the presence of S RBD with these mutations. Additional MD simulation of ACE2

45

WT and decoy interactions with S RBD WT or B.1.351 variant sequence S RBD provides insight

46

into the enhanced affinity of the ACE2 decoy for S RBD and reveals its potential as a tool to

predict affinity and inform therapeutic design. The ACE2 Triple Decoy is now undergoing

continued assessment, including expression by a human adenovirus serotype 5 (hAd5) construct

INTRODUCTION

51

SARS-CoV-2 variants have rapidly swept the globe 1-3 and very recent investigations reveal

52

that several of these variants have shown the ability to escape neutralization by convalescent

53

antibodies in recovered COVID-19 patients

54

developed as therapeutics.

55

against some of the variants and early evidence suggests that for some vaccines, this risk may exist.

56

7,8

57

vaccines designed to elicit immune responses against first-wave sequence SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)

58

protein and specifically the S receptor binding domain (S RBD) that binds to angiotensin-

59

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the surface of human cells in the airway and gut that initiates

60

viral entry and infection.9-12 While one response to the threat of loss of vaccine efficacy might be

61

to continually re-design vaccines to target specific new variants, this would be an ongoing game

62

of catch-up because it can be expected that further novel variants will emerge, particularly since

63

several recent reports have shown that antibodies elicited by infection and vaccination act as

64

evolutionary forces that result in the predominance of viral variants that escape these immune

65

defenses. 13,14

5,6

4

and recombinant neutralizing antibodies (nAbs)

There are also fears that current vaccines may not be as effective

The latter is a particular concern, as the massive vaccine efforts currently underway employ

66

While efforts to adapt vaccines should be encouraged, in parallel, new therapeutic approaches

67

to neutralize viral infection that are not undermined by the presence of mutations should be

68

advanced.

69

To address the need for a therapeutic and potentially prophylactic approach that has a low

70

likelihood of being adversely affected by variant mutations, we have designed and tested ACE2

71

‘decoys’ that leverage the binding of the S RBD to ACE2. This is an approach that is also being

72

pursued by others using a variety of fusion proteins and delivery methods.15-18 Our ACE2 decoys

73

under development are recombinant ACE2-IgG1FC or -IgAFC fusion proteins, with the ACE2

74

sequence optimized for binding affinity to S RBD. The ACE2 decoy would be given to a patient

75

infected with SARS-CoV-2, act to prevent binding of virus to host cell ACE2 by competing with

76

endogenous ACE2 for spike binding, and allow clearance of the virus.19-21

77

To successfully compete, an efficacious ACE2 decoy would ideally have significantly higher

78

affinity for S RBD than endogenous, host-cell expressed ACE2. To identify ACE2 mutations with

79

a high probability of increasing affinity, we utilized our in silico Molecular Dynamic (MD)

80

simulation capabilities as described in Nelson et al.22 “Millisecond-scale molecular dynamics

81

simulation of spike RBD structure reveals evolutionary adaption of SARS-CoV-2 to stably bind

82

ACE2” wherein we reported on our identification of regions of high affinity interaction between

83

ACE2 and S RBD based on previously reported S RBD structures. 23,24

84

Because the ACE2 decoy concept is based on interaction of ACE2 with S RBD, its binding

85

affinity and thus efficacy may also be vulnerable to changes in the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD sequence.

86

We therefore assessed the affinity of our ACE2 decoy, as compared to wild type (WT) ACE2, for

87

S RBD with a variety of single or multiple mutations associated with the currently predominant

88

variants, including the B.1.351 variant expressing E484K, K417N, and N501Y mutations,

89

B.1.1.7 variant (N501Y), 1,26 and the Cal.20.C L452R variant. 27

90

Here, we report our findings that the combined N27Y and H34A mutations of ACE2 conferred

91

the greatest increase in affinity for S RBD of the ACE2 variants tested. Our final ACE2 Triple

92

Decoy also included an H374N mutation to abrogate ACE2 enzymatic activity. This ACE2 Triple

93

Decoy not only maintained affinity for variant S RBD, it showed an increased affinity for S RBD

94

expressing N501Y or L452R mutations.

RESULTS

96

Wild type (WT) ACE2-IgG1FC and ACE2-IgAFC decoys show high affinity for the spike

97

receptor binding domain

98

In initial studies to design an ACE2 decoy, we determined the affinity of both recombinant

99

wild type (WT) ACE2(WT)-IgG1FC and -IgAFC fusion proteins for binding to S RBD by Biolayer

100

Interferometry (BLI) analysis. The ACE2(WT)-IgG1FC decoy (Fig. 1A) showed high affinity for

101

S RBD in both 1:1 binding with a coefficient of dissociation (KD) of 21.40 nM and binding with

102

avidity with a KD of 0.762 nM (Fig. 1C and D, respectively; values in Fig. 1F). The ACE2(WT)-

103

IgAFC dimeric fusion protein (Fig. 1B) demonstrated even higher binding (with avidity) affinity

104

for S RBD with a KD of 0.166 nM (Fig. 1E and F).

112

An ACE2 decoy expressing T27Y and H34A mutations confers the greatest enhancement of

113

affinity for S RBD and improved neutralization of live SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro

114

Based on MD simulation-based predictions of mutations that may confer enhanced binding

115

affinity of ACE2 for S RBD, several ACE2 variants were tested for binding affinity as ACE2-

116

IgG1FC fusion proteins. As shown in Figure 2, a tyrosine (Y) substitution for threonine (T) at

117

residue 27 and an alanine (A) substitution for histidine (H) at residue 34 of ACE2 resulted in 3~5

118

fold increases in binding affinities (T27Y KD = 8.01; H34A KD = 4.09 nM). Combination of the

119

T27Y and H34A substitutions results in a synergistic enhancement of binding affinity, showing an

120

~35-fold increase in binding affinity as compared to ACE2(WT) with the KD decreasing to 0.56

121

nM (Fig. 2D and F).

122

The ACE2(T27Y/H34A)-IgG1FC double decoy was compared to an ACE2(WT)-IgG1FC

123

decoy in a live SARS-CoV-2 virus assay using Vero E6 cells. As shown in Figure 2E, the double

124

mutant ACE2 decoy showed ~15-fold improvement in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization capability

125

compared to the wild type ACE2 Decoy.

MD simulations provide insight into greater affinity of T27Y and H34A ACE2 for S RBD

135

MD simulations (Fig. 3) of the ACE2 T27Y and H34A substitutions suggest that a tyrosine

136

(Y) substitution for threonine (T) at residue 27 introduces favorable hydrophobic contacts with

137

RBD. An alanine (A) substitution for histidine (H) at residue 34 of ACE2 allows more surface area

138

for RBD residues to contact the ACE2 helix and may favorably increase entropy by increasing

139

side chain flexibility. Synergy between these mutations occurs since their effects are independent

140

and do not perturb the binding pose.

Spike (S) occurs as a trimer on the viral surface (orange projections), with the receptor binding
domain (RBD) being on the outermost surface. The interface between S RBD and ACE2 is within

Addition of an H374N mutation inhibits ACE2 enzyme activity

149

In addition to enhanced affinity for competitive binding of S RBD, we wanted to inhibit the

150

enzymatic activity of ACE2.28 Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 has an important role in

151

homeostasis of the renin-angiotensin system

152

and its activity affects a variety of systems. Addition of enzymatically active recombinant ACE2

153

to the system presents a high risk of unwanted side effects and since S RBD binding, but not

154

substrate cleavage activity, is the key function for the ACE2 decoy, we tested a variety of mutations

155

predicted to inhibit ACE2 enzymatic activity with a low likelihood of affecting S RBD binding

156

affinity.

(Supplementary Methods, Supplementary Fig. S1). ACE2 triple mutant decoys comprising the S

160

RBD binding affinity-enhancing T27Y/H34A mutations and the enzymatic activity-inhibiting

161

mutations were produced and binding affinity assessed. Of the triple mutants, those with either the

162

R273K or H374N mutations showed the highest S RBD affinity (Supplementary Table S1).

did inhibit this activity in the assay

163

The final ACE2 Triple Decoy chosen for further testing was ACE2 (T27Y/H34A/H374N)-

164

IgG1FC due to its more favorably biophysical characteristics as compared to an R273K-containing

165

triple mutant, including a lower propensity to aggregate and a higher titer (Supplementary Fig. S2

166

and Table S2).

167

The ACE2 Triple Decoy shows enhanced binding to S RBD expressing N501Y and L452R

168

variants, with the highest affinity for S RBD expressing both N501Y and E484K

variants are shown in Figure 4.

1,26

and CAL.20.C (L452R)

27

173

The ACE2 Triple Decoy showed higher binding affinity to all S RBD sequences as compared

174

to the wild type ACE2 decoy. As compared to the ACE2 Triple Decoy binding affinity for S RBD

175

WT, affinities for S RBD E484K/N501Y, N501Y alone and L452R were higher; affinities for S

176

RBD E484K, K417N/N501Y, N417N/E484K/N501Y, K417K/E484K, and K417N were lower.

177

Findings were similar with the wild type ACE2 decoy, with the highest affinity seen for

178

E484K/N501Y and N501Y alone, and the lowest affinities for variants expressing K417N. N501Y

179

and L452R showed ~2-3 fold increase in binding affinity for both wild type ACE2 decoy and

180

ACE2 Triple Decoy. E484K alone did not affect binding affinity to ACE2. K417N weakened

181

binding affinity for ACE2 (WT) and triple decoys, but affinity was restored when combined with

182

N501Y. The E484K, K417N and N501Y mutations occur together in the B.1.351 strain, whereas

183

L452R alone is found in CAL.20.C, therefore assessment of ACE2 WT binding to these variants

184

as they occur in nature is most physiologically relevant (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table S3).

Inhibition of ACE2:S RBD binding in the surrogate virus neutralization assay correlates

194

with binding affinity

195

The surrogate SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay cPass™

36

is based upon assessment of

196

inhibition of binding of ACE2 (WT) to A SRB (WT). It is typically used to ascertain the presence

197

of anti-S RBD antibodies in serum. Such antibodies inhibit binding of S RBD to ACE2 bound to

198

an ELISA plate, and inhibition of greater than 20% has been reported to correlate with

199

neutralization of live virus. Here, the surrogate assay was used to determine if the ACE2 Triple

200

Decoy could inhibit S RBD WT and variant binding to plate-bound ACE2, that is, compete with

201

ACE2 (WT) for S RBD binding.

202

As shown in Figure 5, the ACE2 Triple Decoy inhibition of binding by the ACE2 Triple Decoy

203

was similar for S RBD WT, E484K, and L452R; and only slightly lower for S RBD N501Y and

204

E484K/K471N/N501Y. Only S RBD K471N binding showed a lower level of inhibition by the

205

ACE2 Triple Decoy, all other variants tested showed inhibition that was significantly higher than

206

the no-decoy control.

MD simulation accurately predicts the relative affinities confirmed by in vitro testing
We used Adaptively-Biased MD (ABMD) simulations,

37

which allow observation and

219

quantification of binding and unbinding, of both ACE2 WT and ACE2 (T27Y/H34A) binding to

220

S RBD WT or B.1.351 to predict binding affinities. For these simulations, the B.1.351 variant

221

comprising the E484K, K417N, and N501Y mutations was used because these mutations occur

222

together naturally and thus this combination has high physiological relevance. The ACE2

223

T27Y/H34A sequence without the additional H374N enzyme-deactivating mutation found in the

224

ACE2 Triple Decoy was used because earlier simulations had been unable to detect a change in

225

affinity due to the presence of the H374N mutation.

226

We used the Helmholtz binding free energy (ΔAbind), determined by the ratio of the probability

227

of the bound and unbound states based on the Free Energy Surfaces (FES) (Figure 6), to assess

228

relative predicted affinities, where more negative values of ΔAbind indicate a stronger association.

229

Details of the ABMD simulations and Helmholtz calculation can be found in Methods. The

230

calculated free energies of binding, in order of predicted affinity from lowest to highest, are: ACE2

231

WT:RBD WT (-4.1 kcal/mol; Fig. 6A); ACE2 WT:RBD B.1.351 (-5.1 kcal/mol; Fig. 6B); ACE2

232

T27Y/H34A:RBD B.1.351 (-6.3 kcal/mol; Fig. 6C); and ACE2 T27Y/H34A:RBD WT (-7.0

233

kcal/mol; Fig. 6D).

234

The predictive utility of these simulations is supported by the findings from the affinities (KD)

235

determined in vitro and presented in Figure 4, where (for the combinations tested in MD

236

simulations) the lowest affinity was also seen for ACE2 WT : RBD WT (KD = 9.33 nM), followed

237

by ACE2 WT : RBD B.1.351 (KD = 5.28 nM), then ACE2 Decoy : RBD B.1.351 (KD = 0.465

238

nM), and ACE2 Decoy : RBD WT (KD = 0.315 nM). Note that all affinities were high, and higher

239

for Triple Decoy binding than ACE2 WT for all RBD sequences tested.

DISCUSSION

251

To our knowledge, we are the first to report binding affinities of a recombinant mutant ACE2

252

decoy to the spike receptor binding domain expressing N501Y, E484K, N417Y, or L452R

253

mutations; although we note Huang et al. reported previously on the affinity of their ACE2-FC to

254

S RBD with the D614G mutation.

255

substitution alone or in combination with E484K reported here is in alignment with our findings

256

in Nelson et al.39 wherein we used MD simulation to predict that these mutations have a high

257

probability of increasing affinity for ACE2.

38

The greater affinity of ACE2 for S RBD with the N501Y

258

The MD simulation data presented here used to guide design of the ACE2 Triple Decoy and

259

to predict affinities of the decoy as compared to ACE2 WT for a series of variants reveal again the

260

merits of such simulations as a tool to inform therapeutic design.

261

Interestingly, widespread use of an ACE2 decoy has the potential itself to act as an

262

evolutionary force; however, an ACE2 decoy largely recognizes the same residues as endogenous

263

ACE2 and therefore it is highly unlikely a SARS-CoV-2 variant could emerge that ‘escapes’ the

264

decoy yet still binds to endogenous ACE2. This phenomenon along with limited use of a decoy

265

for therapy as compared to the spread of virus in a large population with opportunity for selection,

266

makes the decoy approach less vulnerable to loss of efficacy due to mutation of the virus.

267

The enhanced binding affinity of our Triple Mutant ACE2 Decoy to S RBD with the variant

268

mutations tested here supports continued pursuit of this therapeutic approach and further provides

269

hope that even should the efficacy of vaccines currently in distribution or therapeutic neutralizing

270

antibodies raised against WT spike be lessened by these variants, there will be an alternative

271

therapeutic approach to successfully treat COVID-19 disease.

In our next steps in development of the ACE2 Triple Decoy, we will address the challenge of

273

stability and successful delivery. Others developing ACE2 decoys have suggested use of intranasal

The WT-ACE2/RBD complex was built from the cryo-EM structure, PDB 6M17 of full-

426

length human ACE2 in the presence of the neutral amino acid transported B0AT1 with the S RBD

427

as shown in Yan et al. 47 using RBD residues 336-518 and ACE2 residues 21-614. ACE2 residues

428

27 and 34 were mutated to tyrosine and alanine, respectively. The final simulation system was

429

built using the Amber ff14SB force field 48. The RISM program from AmberTools19 49 was used

to determine optimal locations for water molecules in direct contact with the proteins. Bulk waters

431

were added to create a sufficient octahedral water box and sodium ions were added at random

432

locations to neutralize the system. After introducing mutations at the relevant residues, the same

433

procedure was used to generate the other three systems.

434

Simulation

435

Ten copies of each RBD/ACE2 complex were minimized, equilibrated and simulated.

436

Minimization occurred in two phases. During the first, the protein and RISM-placed waters were

437

restrained. The second phase minimized the entire system. Dynamics then began and the

438

temperature was ramped from 0 to 300K while restraining the protein and RISM-placed waters.

439

All dynamics used SHAKE restraints on hydrogen-containing bonds and a 2 fs timestep. All

440

restraints were then released and the system was equilibrated in the NPT ensemble for 2 ns. Finally,

441

each system was equilibrated in the NVT ensemble for 100 ns.

442

Steered MD was used to prepare the equilibrated systems for free energy calculation.

443

Contacting residues from the adaptively biased MD (ABMD) simulations in Nelson et al. 22,37 were

444

used. Starting from the NVT equilibrated structures and over a 10 ns simulation, the number of

445

intermolecular contacts was linearly reduced to 0 using a 10 kcal/mol*Å steering bias. Structures

446

were randomly selected from the steered MD simulations and used to seed ABMD simulations.

447

Two dimensional ABMD simulations used intermolecular contacts and the center of mass distance

448

as collective variables. Centers of mass were defined as the alpha carbons from all interfacial

449

residues in each molecule. The well-tempered ABMD bias potential

450

calculations. ABMD simulations were run for a total of 15.6µs, 16.0µs, 16.0µs and 16.38µs for

451

the ACE2 WT:RBD WT, RBD WT:ACE2 T27Y/H34A, RBD B.1.351:ACE2 WT and RBD

B.1.351:ACE2 T27Y/H34A, respectively. Production simulations were run in the NVT ensemble

453

meaning the calculated free energy corresponds to the Helmholz free energy. (ΔA)

454

ABMD produces a free energy surface (FES) that describes the relative free energy between

455

any two points on the FES, ΔAFES. The binding free energy (ΔAbind) is determined by the ratio of

456

the probability of the bound and unbound states and can be determined from the FES:

Δ𝐴#$%& = − ln >?@%&
β ∫
𝑑𝑥𝑑𝑦𝑒 2345678 (:,<)

(1)

A%#?@%&

458

Where β is the inverse of the Boltzmann constant multiplied by the temperature in Kelvins. More

459

negative values of ΔAbind indicate a stronger association. The calculated ΔAbind values can be

460

directly compared.

461

The “Bound” integral in equation 1 is defined to be over all ΔAFES(x,y) values with the number

462

of contacts greater than 0.05 while the “Unbound” integral is over all values with fewer than 0.05

463

contacts. ΔAbind was calculated with different boundaries ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, inclusive. As

464

expected, the resulting values of ΔAbind changed based on the chosen boundary. However, the

465

relative ordering of the values did not. The value of 0.05 contacts was chosen as the boundary

466

Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR) were conducted using PrimeSTAR GXL DNA

474

Polymerase (Takara Bio) per manufacturer’s instructions. Primers and Gene Fragments were

475

synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). For Gibson Assembly, NEBuilder Hifi DNA

476

Assembly Master Mix (New England Biolabs) was used. For DNA ligation, we used T4 DNA

477

Ligase (NEB) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasmid sequences were confirmed by sanger

478

sequencing (Genewiz).

479

ACE2-IgG1FC was created by Gibson Assembly of 3 fragments: 1) the vector backbone from

480

a NheI-XhoI 7.168 kb fragment of pWT35, 2) ACE2 from a 1.86 kb PCR product of WH1043 and

481

WH1044 amplification of gene-synthesized ACE2 codon optimized for expression in CHO

482

epithelial cell line (AO615ACE2), and 3) IgG1FC from a 0.701 kb PCR product of pXL159, using

483

primers WH1045 and WH1046. ACE2 R273Q-IgG1FC was constructed similarly, with the

484

exception that ACE2 R273Q was created by splice by overlap extension (SOE). A 1.86 kb SOE

485

product was created by amplification with primers WH1043 and WH1044 of two PCR products:

486

1) 860 bp amplification of AO615ACE2 with primers WH1043 and WH1049, and 2) 1.059 bp

487

amplification product of AO615ACE2 with primers WH1050 and WH1044.

488

ACE2 T27Y/H34A-IgG1FC was constructed by the Gibson Assembly of: 1) a 9.041 kb NheI-

489

PshA1 digestion fragment of ACE2-IgG1FC plasmid, and 2) a 0.773 kb SOE product of primers

490

5MutF and 5MutR of two PCR products. The first PCR is a 0.154 kb amplification of plasmid SR9

491

with primers 5MutF and ACE2T27YR). The second PCR products is a 0.642 kb amplification of

492

plasmid SR9 with primers ACE2T27YF and 5MutR.

SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL
Supplementary Methods
Assay for ACE2 enzymatic activity
Enzymatic activity ACE2 decoys expressing a variety of mutations - R273Q, R273K,
R273L, H245A, H505L, H374N, and H378N – selected to inhibit activity in combination with
the S RBD affinity-enhancing mutations T27Y and H34A were assessed in the FRET based
ACE2 activity assay.
Supplementary Results
As shown in Figure S1, wild type (WT) and the T27Y/H34A mutations had similar ACE2
enzymatic activity. Addition of R273Q, R273K, R273L, H245A, H505L, H374N, or H378N
mutations in combination with the T27Y/H34A mutations inhibited activity of ACE2.

Fig. S1. ACE2 activity assay. Enzyme activity of ACE2 in relative fluorescent units (RFU) for
each decoy is shown.
To choose which of these activity-inhibiting mutations would be used in combination with
the two affinity-enhancing mutations, we compared BLI kinetic analysis of S RBD binding for
each. Of the triple mutants, the ones expressing R273K or H374N had the lowest dissociation
coefficient (KD), that is, highest affinity binding.
The T27Y/H34A/H374N triple mutant was chosen for further testing because it showed
better biophysical properties, including a lower propensity to aggregate, higher titer/better Tm as
compared to the decoy with the R273K substitution.
