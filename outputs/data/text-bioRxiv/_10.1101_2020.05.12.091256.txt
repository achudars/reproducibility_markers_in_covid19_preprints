Most antiviral agents are designed to target virus-specific proteins and mechanisms rather than the host cell proteins that
are critically dysregulated following virus-mediated reprogramming of the host cell transcriptional state. To overcome these
limitations, we propose that elucidation and pharmacologic targeting of host cell Master Regulator proteins—whose aberrant activities govern the reprogramed state of coronavirusinfected cells—presents unique opportunities to develop novel
mechanism-based therapeutic approaches to antiviral therapy,
either as monotherapy or as a complement to established treatments. Specifically, we propose that a small module of host cell
Master Regulator proteins (ViroCheckpoint) is hijacked by the
virus to support its efficient replication and release. Conventional methodologies are not well suited to elucidate these potentially targetable proteins. By using the VIPER network-based
algorithm, we successfully interrogated 12h, 24h, and 48h signatures from Calu-3 lung adenocarcinoma cells infected with
SARS-CoV, to elucidate the time-dependent reprogramming of
host cells and associated Master Regulator proteins. We used
the NYS CLIA-certified Darwin OncoTreat algorithm, with an
existing database of RNASeq profiles following cell perturbation with 133 FDA-approved and 195 late-stage experimental
compounds, to identify drugs capable of virtually abrogating
the virus-induced Master Regulator signature. This approach
to drug prioritization and repurposing can be trivially extended
to other viral pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2, as soon as the
relevant infection signature becomes available.

Introduction
SARS-CoV is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded
RNA virus of the genera Betacoronavirus introduced into
the human population from an animal reservoir and culminating in a lethal epidemic in 2002-03, affecting 8,098 indi-

viduals, 774 of whom died (9.6%)(1). The virus shares 79%
genome sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic(2). SARSCoV can generate a rapid inflammatory cascade eventually
leading to pneumonia or severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS), characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, extensive disruption of epithelial cells and accumulation of reactive macrophages(3). Similar to SARS-CoV-2, SARSCoV spike protein S binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is widely expressed on the cell membrane of oral, lung, and nasal mucosa epithelial cells, arterial smooth muscle and venous endothelial cells, as well
of other organs, including stomach, small intestine, colon,
skin, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain(4). Supportive care—including prevention of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, and secondary
infections—remains the foundational approach for managing
serious infections caused by coronaviruses, although preliminary analysis of a recently-reported, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, suggests that patients receiving
remdesivir recovered faster than those receiving placebo(5–
7). Despite early optimism and approval on May 1st , 2020 of
remdesivir for emergency use in hospitalized patients with
COVID-19, no other specific antiviral treatment has been
proven to be effective in randomized, placebo-controlled
trials(5, 6). Consequently, there remains a formidable unmet need to identify pharmacologic treatments, alone or
in combination—directly targeting either viral mechanisms
and/or host cell factors—that significantly inhibit viral replication and, by extension, minimize progression of target organ failure associated with COVID-19.
Current efforts focusing on antiviral drug discovery can be
summarized as belonging to two broad strategies: (a) disrupting the synthesis and assembly of viral proteins or (b) targeting host proteins and mechanisms required by the viral replication cycle. The first strategy has yielded drugs targeting
(i) viral proteases, required for processing of the virus large

replicase polyprotein 1a, producing non-structural proteins
involved in viral transcription and replication(5, 8); (ii) RNAdependent RNA-polymerase, using guanosine and adenosine
analogs, as well as acyclovir derivatives; (iii) virus helicases;
(iv) viral spike proteins, with antibodies, peptide decoys and
carbohydrate-binding agents; and (v) structural proteins such
as those maintaining ion channel activity of CoV E protein
and RNA-binding affinity of CoV N protein(5, 6, 9, 10). Although virus-targeting approaches have the advantage of being specific, and, therefore, generally offer acceptable toxicity profiles, targeting viral products typically restricts the
applicability of antiviral agents to only one, or only a few,
closely related virus species. Moreover, due to the high mutation rate of viral genomes, such drugs are prone to rapid
virus adaptation by resistant strain selection(11, 12). Considering the time required to develop new pharmacologic agents,
this strategy has proven unsuitable to address new viral epidemics and pandemics in real time.
In contrast, targeting host cell proteins, especially at an early
stage when viral hijacking of host mechanisms may still be
reversible, may have more universal and longer term value
because the same host factors may be required by multiple,
potentially unrelated viral species and because host target
proteins mutate far less rapidly than viral proteins, thereby
limiting emergence of drug resistance(13). Unfortunately,
pharmacologic targeting of host factors is more commonly
associated with toxicity, thereby limiting clinical application
of many drugs identified as potential anti-viral agents in vitro,
for instance, with anti-CoV drugs EC50 markedly exceeding
their maximum tolerated serum concentration (Cmax )(5).
Despite these translational challenges, current approaches to
target host proteins are primarily based on either boosting innate anti-viral immune response, in particular interferon response, or targeting proteins and processes mediating viral
infection, such as ACE2 receptors(14), cell surface and endosomal proteases(15), and clathrin mediated endocytosis(16).
Moreover, broad availability of high-throughput screening
approaches has allowed the purposing and repurposing of
drugs based on their effect on virus replication(16–19), leading to identification of several anti-coronavirus candidates,
such as chloroquine, tamoxifen, dasatinib and lopinavir,
among others(16, 19). Yet, this approach is limited by the
idiosyncratic nature of the in vitro models used in antiviral
screens and by drug concentrations that may not be achievable in patients(5).
More recently, systems biology approaches, including temporal kinome analysis(20) and proteomics(21–24), have also
been used to identify protein kinases—and associated pathways—modulated in response to virus infection, as well as to
generate virus-host protein-protein interactomes (PPI). These
methods also present an opportunity to develop and test hosttargeting therapeutic approaches that apply functional genomics to the “infected system as a whole.”(24) The output of these predictions can be used to direct drug repurposing efforts(21–23) and to design more focused in vitro
screens, with models that better recapitulate disease patho-

physiology, such as primary cells, organoids or 3D organ-onchip systems(25).
Coronaviruses have been shown to extensively hijack the
cellular machinery of host cells they infect; as one example, this class of viruses induces arrest in S phase, allowing them to benefit from physiological alterations they induce in host cells that enhance their reproductive rate(26).
As shown for other physiologic(27–29) and pathologic cell
states—among them, cancer(30–34), neurodegeneration(35,
36), and diabetes(29)—we propose that such transcriptionally “locked” states are established by the virus and maintained by a handful of Master Regulator (MR) proteins, organized within a highly auto-regulated protein module, or
checkpoint (see Califano & Alvarez(30) for a recent perspective). For simplicity, in a viral infection context, we will
call such modules “ViroCheckpoints.” Accordingly, we propose that aberrant, virus-mediated activation of a ViroCheckpoint is ultimately responsible for creating a transcriptionally
“locked” cellular context that is primed for viral replication
and release. We thus propose ViroCheckpoint activity reversal as a potentially valuable therapeutic strategy for pharmacologic intervention.
Here we show that time-dependent, SARS-CoV-mediated
ViroCheckpoints—and the specific MR proteins of which
they are comprised—can be effectively elucidated by
network-based analysis using the Virtual Inference of Protein
activity by Enriched Regulon (VIPER) algorithm(37). More
importantly, once the MR protein identity is available, drugs
can be effectively and reproducibly prioritized based on their
ability to invert the activity of ViroCheckpoint MR proteins,
using the OncoTreat algorithm(34), a NYS CLIA-certified algorithm that is used routinely on cancer patients at Columbia
University.(38)
Accurate identification of virus-dependent MR proteins permits deployment of the same OncoTreat-based methodological approach for mechanism-based repurposing or development of new drugs with potential anti-viral activity. To avoid
confusion, we will use the term “ViroTreat” to indicate the
virus-specific version of OncoTreat. Specifically, ViroTreat
uses the full repertoire of virus-induced MR proteins in the
ViroCheckpoint as a reporter assay to identify drugs capable
of reversing its activity(34), thereby preventing emergence of
or abrogating the virus-mediated transcriptional locked state.
While limited by the availability of data on SARS-CoV-2, including of infection in an appropriate pathophysiologic cell
context, we provide proof of concept that this approach can
be applied to prioritizing FDA-approved and late-stage investigational drugs representing potential antiviral agents for
SARS-CoV based on infection in cancer-related lung epithelial cells.

Similar to a highly-multiplexed gene reporter assay, VIPER
measures the activity of an individual protein based on the
enrichment of its positively regulated and repressed targets
in genes that are over- and under-expressed in a specific cell
state, compared to a control(37). We have shown that VIPER
can accurately measure the activity of >70% of regulatory
proteins and, as a result, the algorithm has been used to elucidate MRs of both pathologic(31–33, 35, 36, 40, 41) and physiologic cell states(27–29) that have been experimentally validated. Moreover, VIPER-inferred protein activity has been
shown to provide a better biomarker of cell phenotype than
the original transcriptional profile(30, 34, 42, 43); and, importantly, is a better reporter for validating clinically relevant
drug sensitivity(44). Accordingly, VIPER requires a differential expression signature for each sample to be analyzed
and a regulatory model comprising the transcriptional targets
of each regulatory protein. For the former, we computed a
differential gene expression signature for each SARS-CoV
infected sample, by comparing it to three 12h mock control
replicates. For the latter, we leveraged a transcriptional regulatory model (interactome) generated by ARACNe(45) analysis of 517 samples in the lung adenocarcinoma cohort of The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)(37). Use of a cancer-related
interactome is well justified as we have shown that protein
transcriptional targets are highly conserved between cancer
and normal cells(28).
The analysis revealed n = 236 proteins, whose activity was
significantly affected by SARS-CoV infection in at least one
time point (p < 10−5 , Bonferroni Corrected (BC), see Supplementary Table 1). Examination of the top 10 activated
MR proteins at each of the evaluated time-points (Fig. 1a) revealed the presence of canonical cell-cycle regulators, including (a) cyclins (CCNA2), and other proteins involved in G1/S
transition(46) (E2F8 and UHRF1); (b) S-phase proteins, such
as topoisomerases (TOP2A(47)) and other factors involved in
S-phase cell cycle arrest(48) (CHEK1, GTSE1); (c) mitotic
checkpoint proteins(49) (BUB1B, KIF11 and NDC80); and
(d) proteins involved in nucleotide synthesis (GMPS). These
showed significant activation as early as 12h after SARSCoV infection. In contrast, established innate immune response proteins were also found among the top activated
MRs, including IFN-induced factors(50) (MX1, IRF9 and
IFI27) but their activation became most evident only at the
latest time point (48h). Interestingly, some proteins previously identified as key tumor MRs were strongly activated,

such as FOXM1 and CENPF(33, 51), although this may be
a byproduct of the cancer related nature of the Calu-3 cells
used in the infection assays.
We then systematically evaluated whether viral infection
could affect host proteins known to be involved in SARSCoV host-pathogen protein-protein interactions (PPI). We
based this analysis on a set of 36 proteins previously identified by high-throughput yeast-2-hybrid screen and validated
by luciferase assays(23). Of the 36, 12 were represented
among our set of 6,054 regulons and could thus be assessed
for enrichment in SARS-CoV-induced differentially active
proteins. Despite the low statistical power of a test based on
only 12 proteins, enrichment was statistically significant for
the 12h activity signature (p < 0.01, Supplementary Fig. 1a).
Enrichment was borderline non-significant at 24h (p = 0.08),
and not significant at 48h (Supplementary Figs. 1b and c).
To increase the test’s sensitivity, we leveraged a larger set of
proteins identified as PPI for 26 of the 29 proteins coded by
the closely related SARS-CoV-2 virus, as identified by massspec analysis of pull-down assays(21). Of 332 host proteins
identified by that analysis, 89 were represented among those
analyzed by VIPER. Confirming the prior results, enrichment was highly significant (p12h < 10−5 by 2-tail aREA
test(37); p24h < 0.01 and p48h < 0.001 by 1-tail aREA test,
see Supplementary Fig. 1g, k and l, respectively). Interestingly, while enrichment was significant at all three time

points, (p < 0.01, 1-tail aREA test, Supplementary Fig. 1j–
l), several of the human SARS-CoV-2 PPIs activated at 12h
became inactivated at later time points (Supplementary Fig.
1h–i).
Correlation analysis showed a gradual shift in protein-activity
signatures from 12h to 48h after infection (Fig. 1b), suggesting dynamic activation and inactivation of a diverse repertoire
of genetic programs by virus-host interaction and thus dynamic transition across multiple, time-dependent ViroCheckpoints. To gain insight into the biological programs most
profoundly affected by SARS-CoV infection, we performed
Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)(52) of a set of 50
biologically-relevant hallmark gene-sets from MSigDB(53)
in differentially active, infection-mediated proteins (Fig. 2).
The analysis identified four time-dependent program classes
including: (a) cell cycle programs, consistently up-regulated
at all three time points; (b) immune-related programs, associated with interferon response, inflammatory response, TNFα, and IL-6/JACK/STAT3 signaling, which were progressively upregulated over time; (c) DNA repair pathways and
(d) PI3K/AKT/mTOR programs more strongly activated at
12h (Fig. 2).
Consistent with the multifarious effects that coronaviruses
are known to exert through their complex, synchronized modulations of cell cycle progression, interferon antagonism, interleukin 6 and 8 induction, and host protein synthesis(26),
these findings disclose a time-dependency, with early vs.
late activation of protein signatures each linked to a distinct set of biofunctional hallmarks resulting from a virusgoverned reconfiguration of the host cell’s regulatory state,
with alterations in cell cycle during the initial post-infection
phase, followed by a phase characterized by ignition of proinflammatory cytokine signaling pathways.
ViroTreat analysis of SARS-CoV infected cells identifies novel therapeutic targets for drug repurposing.

We have previously developed and validated a systematic approach (OncoTreat) for identifying drugs and compounds capable of reversing the aberrant activity of all Tumor Checkpoint MRs, representing mechanistic determinants of cell
state, on a patient by patient basis(34). As a direct result
of the high reproducibility demonstrated by VIPER,(37) the
test has been certified by the NYS-CLIA laboratory and is
available in the United States from the Columbia University
Laboratory of Personalized Genomic Medicine(38); and, in
China, from the Xiamen Encheng Group Ltd.
OncoTreat is used routinely to assess potential therapy for
cancer patients who are progressing on standard of care, as
part of the Columbia Precision Oncology Initiative(54). Despite the fact that it was originally developed for deployment
and drug prioritization in the setting of precision oncology,
the OncoTreat methodology is fully generalizable and can be
applied to any state transition and any drug collection, including transitions related to and induced by viral infection.
To avoid confusion, we will use the term ViroTreat to refer
to the algorithm when used to identify antiviral drugs (see

description in Fig. 3).
ViroTreat requires a tissue-matched drug perturbation
database. For this analysis, we had previously generated a
collection of RNASeq profiles of NCI-H1793 lung adenocarcinoma cells, at 24h following treatment with a repertoire of 133 FDA approved and 195 late-stage (Phase 2
and 3) drugs—primarily used in or developed for the oncology setting—at their highest subtoxic concentration (48h
IC20 ) or maximum serum concentration (Cmax ), whichever
is lower. RNASeq data was generated using a fully automated, 96-well based microfluidic technology called PLATESeq(55) (Supplementary Table 2). Selection of the NCIH1793 cell line as an adequate model for the analysis was
based on the significant overlap of SARS-CoV infection MR
proteins with proteins differentially activated in this cell line
(p < 10−28 , 10−38 , and 10−24 at 12h, 24h and 48h after infection, by 1-tail aREA test; see Supplementary Fig. 2). In
addition, the main rationale for these assays is the elucidation of protein-level MoA of a drug repertoire and MoA is
generally well-recapitulated in lineage matched cells(56).
Using this predictive model, ViroTreat prioritized 44 FDAapproved drugs and 49 investigational compounds in oncology, based on their ability to significantly invert the ViroCheckpoint protein activity signature, at one or more of
the 3 evaluated time-points following infection (p < 10−10 ,
BC; see Supplementary Table 3). Based on this analysis, two
FDA-approved drugs—the CDK inhibitor palbociclib and
the MEK inhibitor trametinib—and 4 investigational compounds, including three MAP kinase and one AKT/CHEK1
inhibitors, were able to significantly invert the ViroCheckpoint activity at all three time-points (p < 10−10 , BC, Fig.
4a). In addition, six FDA-approved drugs and seven investigational compounds demonstrated the capacity to invert the
ViroCheckpoint protein activity pattern at the two earliest
time points (12h and 24h, p < 10−10 , BC, Fig. 4a); while two
FDA-approved drugs—the ALK and EGFR inhibitors brigatinib and osimertinib—and five investigational compounds
were predicted to significantly invert the MR signature identified at later time points (24h and 48h, p < 10−10 , BC, Fig.
4a).
Consistent with the pathways enrichment analysis (Fig. 2),
several drug families were enriched among the top ViroTreat
predictions, including MAP kinases, PI3K/AKT/mTOR,
CDK and other cell cycle-related drugs; HDAC and bromodomain protein inhibitors; proteasome and HSP90 inhibitors;
and NF-κB and JAK inhibitors (Fig. 4a).
Of special clinical relevance in the context of the COVID-19
pandemic, ViroTreat independently identified the Selective
Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) drug selinexor—FDAapproved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple
myeloma—as an extremely potent inverter of SARS-CoV induced ViroCheckpoint activity, in particular, at 12h and 24h
time points after infection (p12h < 10−16 and p24h < 10−19 ,
BC, Fig. 4).

(A) aproteicontextspecific drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) database, which is generated by perturbing an appropriate cell model with therapeutically relevant drug concentrations, followed by VIPER analysis of the drug-induced gene expression signatures and identification of the top most differentially active proteins, both activated
and inactivated in response to the drug; and (B) the specific virus-induced protein activity signature—where the most differentially active proteins constitute the
ViroCheckpoint—dissected by VIPER analysis of a gene expression signature, obtained by comparing an infected tissue or relevant model with non-infected mock
controls. ViroTreat then predicts the effect of the drugs on the ViroCheckpoint by
matching their MoA with the virus-induced protein activity signature, and quantifies
the inverse enrichment using the aREA algorithm. The diagram shows 3 drugs,
where only drug B, by activating the host proteins that are being inactivated during virus infection, and inactivating the proteins that are being activated by the virus
infection, effectively acts by inverting the ViroCheckpoint activity pattern; and, therefore, would be prioritized as a host cell-targeted antiviral therapeutic option.

from G1 and to arrest the host cell in S phase(57). SARSCoV further favors host cell arrest in S phase by inhibiting CDK4 and CDK6 kinase activity(58). We also observed
activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway proteins, suggesting that SARS-CoV—similar to other viruses(59), including +ssRNA viruses like chikungunya(60), hepatitis C(61),
west nile(62) and dengue(63), as well as other RNA respiratory viruses like influenza(64) and the respiratory syncytial
virus(65)—might subvert mTOR pathway activity. Indeed,
temporal kinome analysis of human hepatocytes infected
with MERS-CoV had previously revealed changes in MAPK
and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways(20). Finally, we observed
activation of proteins involved in innate immunity, including
interferon response and pro-inflammatory pathways, which
have been also previously described for coronaviruses(26).

Fig. 4. Top drugs and compounds identified by ViroTreat. (a) Table of FDA-approved drugs and investigational compounds identified by ViroTreat as significantly inverting the
pattern of activity of the SARS-CoV induced checkpoint (p < 10−10 , BC) for at least one of the three analyzed time points, and being simultaneously significant (p < 10−5 ,
BC) for at least another time point. The drugs and compounds were organized in blocks according to the biological role or pathway membership of their primary target protein.
For each block, the drugs and compounds significant for each time point (p < 10−10 , BC), were sorted by their ViroTreat significant level for 12h, followed by 24h and 48h.
FDA-approved drugs were reported prior to investigational compounds. The table also shows the concentration used to perturb NCI-H1793 cells, the ViroTreat significance
level, as –log10 (p-value), BC, indicated by the green heatmap, and the primary target for each of the significant drugs and compounds. (b–d) GSEA plots showing the
enrichment of the top 25 proteins most activated (red vertical lines), and the top 25 proteins most inactivated (blue vertical lines), in NCI-H1793 cells in response to selinexor
perturbation, on the protein activity signatures induced by SARS-CoV infection of Calu-3 cells (x-axis) for 12h (b), 24h (c) and 48h (d). NES and p-value, estimated by 2-tail
aREA test, are indicated on top of each plot.

While formal experimental validation is still required, there
are several positive indications this approach may be effective. Specifically, drugs for SARS-CoV most highly
prioritized by ViroTreat were highly consistent, at least
based on their primary target proteins, with biological programs and pathways known to be modulated by coronavirus
infection(26, 66). Notably, in this regard, cell cycle progression/proliferation, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, innate immunity and
inflammation are well represented among the primary target
proteins for those pharmacologic agents strongly predicted
by ViroTreat to possess host cell-targeted, antiviral effects.
A literature search revealed that many of the oncology drugs
and compounds identified by ViroTreat have been considered
previously for their potential antiviral effects. For instance,
the MAPK inhibitor trametinib, one of the top ViroTreat hits
for SARS-CoV, was shown to inhibit MERS-CoV replication in vitro(5, 20), as well as influenza A virus both in
vitro and in vivo(67). Similarly, everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor identified by ViroTreat, has also been shown to inhibit MERS-CoV(5, 20) and cytomegalovirus(68) replication
in vitro, as well as to reduce incidence of cytomegalovirus
infections following kidney transplant(69). Among tyrosine
kinase inhibitors identified by ViroTreat, dasatinib was previously described to inhibit MERS-CoV(5, 19) and HIV-1(70)

replication in vitro; while erlotinib was shown to inhibit
dengue(71), hepatitis C(72) and ebola(73) replication. The
HSP90 inhibitors SNX-2112 and luminespib, as well as the
sarco/endoplasmatic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin, all identified by ViroTreat as inverters of the SARSCoV induced checkpoint, have been shown to inhibit herpes simplex(74), chikungunya(75), foot and mouth disease
virus(76), respiratory syncytial virus(77), rhinovirus(78) and
hepatitis A virus replication(79).
Finally, ViroTreat independently identified the SINE drug
molecule selinexor—an FDA-approved agent for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma—as an extremely potent inverter of SARS-CoV-induced ViroCheckpoint activity. Selinexor is a potent and highly-specific inhibitor of XPO1 activity, which leads to nuclear retention
of its cargo proteins containing leucine rich Nuclear Export Signals. Based on experimental studies performed by
Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc., low Selinexor concentrations
(leq 100 nM) inhibited viral replication by 90% in green
monkey kidney Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2(80).
As a result of these observations and data, which are consistent with the ViroTreat prioritization of selinexor we report in this study, a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2
clinical study (NCT04355676 and NCT04349098), evaluat-

Identification and Targeting the SARS-CoV ViroCheckpoint

ing low dose oral selinexor in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 has been initiated and is currently enrolling
patients, with results anticipated to be reported by August
31st , 2020(80).
This analysis has several limitations that partially restrict its
value as proof of concept. Specifically, infection was conducted in a cancer cell line, rather than in a more physiologically relevant context, such as in primary bronchial or
alveolar epithelial cells. In addition, drug perturbations were
also performed in a cancer cell line context, thus potentially
introducing undesired confounding factors, even though use
of mock controls for the infection, and vehicle control for
the drug perturbations, from the same cancer cell line should
have eliminated most of the cancer-related bias and cell line
idiosyncrasies. As a result, extrapolation of this approach
to the clinic may be limited by the following assumptions:
(a) that the host cell regulatory checkpoint hijacked by the
virus is conserved between the Calu-3 adenocarcinoma cell
line and the normal alveolar or bronchial epithelial cells in
vivo; and (2) that the drugs’ and compounds’ MoA is conserved between the NCI-H1793 lung adenocarcinoma cells
and normal lung epithelial cells in vivo. Moreover, while
for the generation of the perturbational data and the contextspecific MoA database we used subtoxic drug concentrations
that, in most cases, were well below the maximum tolerated
dose for all drugs and compounds, the relevant pharmacologic concentration for their deployment as antiviral therapy
may be much lower than the original recommended concentration for their use as anti-cancer drugs.
Further research is necessary to benchmark the ViroTreat approach. Specifically, better reporters of SARS-CoV infection
should be established, ideally directly from nasopharyngeal
swabs or bronchial lavage of SARS-CoV patients. More relevant to the current pandemic, such samples are starting to
emerge from COVID-19 patients and may lead to elucidation of critical entry points for COVID-19 therapeutic intervention. Similarly, drug profiles should be generated in a
more physiologic context, including primary airway epithelial cells. It is also important to establish whether virusinduced transcriptional lock states are similar across all cell
and tissue contexts infected by the virus, or whether the hijacked states are cell context-specific. Finally, appropriate
environments for in vitro and in vivo validation of prioritized
drugs should be developed(56).
To our knowledge, this is the first time a virus-induced MR
module (i.e., the ViroCheckpoint) is proposed as a pharmacological target to abrogate the virus’s ability to hijack the
cellular machinery of host cells, a strategy that coronaviruses
are known to employ to prime the host cell environment so it
is amenable to viral replication and release(26). In addition,
ViroTreat represents a unique method for the systematic and
quantitative prioritization of mechanism-based, host-directed
drugs capable of abrogating this critical, and previously unaddressed component of viral infection. If effectively validated, this approach presents several advantages: First, ViroTreat is tailored to target the entire repertoire of host pro-

teins hijacked by the virus to create a permissive environment, rather than a single host or viral protein. As such, we
anticipate drugs identified by ViroTreat to have more universal applications, including being effective against a broader
viral repertoire, while also being more effective at eluding
virus adaptation mechanisms arising from rapid mutation under drug selection stress. Indeed, drug-mediated reprogramming of host cell to a transcriptional state that confers resistance against coronavirus-induced reprogramming presents
the opportunity to identify drugs that are potentially effective for a broader class of viruses, as long as they share similar pathobiological strategies for host cell takeover. Second,
the ViroTreat analysis can be performed expeditiously—as
soon as the ViroCheckpoint signature of a novel virus becomes available. Therefore, this methodology is especially
well-suited to the urgency characteristic of epidemics and
pandemics.
Developing effective treatments for respiratory tract
infections—i.e., those that reduce such hard end points
as hospitalization, need for mechanical ventilation, and
mortality—exclusively through direct viral targeting has
been historically challenging. Drugs identified specifically
for host cell-targeting have the potential therapeutic advantage of acting in a mechanistically complementary—even
synergistic—way with readily available antivirals, thereby
suggesting roadmaps for developing and testing combination
regimens that may mitigate viral replication by acting upon
the infected system as a whole. Such multi-mechanistic
pharmacologic approaches targeting both the virus and host
cell proteins that are critically dysregulated as a result of viral
infection may be required to optimize clinical outcomes,
especially in challenging and vulnerable patients exposed to
lethal pathogens with high virulence and viral load.

Promega). Relative cell viability was computed using matched
DMSO control wells as reference. ED20 was estimated by fitting
a four-parameter sigmoid model to the titration results. NCI-H1793
cells, plated in 384-well plates, were then perturbed with a library
of 328 FDA-approved drugs and small-molecule compounds at their
corresponding ED20 concentration. Cells were lysed at 24h after
small-molecule compound perturbation and the transcriptome was
profiled by PLATE-Seq(55). RNA-Seq reads were mapped to the
human reference genome assembly 38 using the STAR aligner(81).
Expression data were then normalized by equivariance transformation, based on the negative binomial distribution with the DESeq Rsystem package (Bioconductor(82)). At least two replicates for each
condition were obtained. Differential gene expression signatures
were computed by comparing each condition with plate-matched
vehicle control samples using a moderated Student’s t-test as implemented in the limma package from Bioconductor(83). Individual
gene expression signatures were then transformed into protein activity signatures with the VIPER algorithm(37), based on the a lung
adenocarcinoma context-specific regulatory network available from
the aracne.networks package from Bioconductor.
Computational analysis. Enrichment of gene-sets for biological

hallmarks was performed using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis(52)
with the Molecular Signatures Database MSigDB v7.1(53). Enrichment analysis for virus-interacting host proteins (PPI) on
SARS-CoV induced protein activity signatures, as well as the
OncoMatch(56) analysis to assess the conservation of the virusinduced MR protein activity on NCI-H1793 lung adenocarcinoma
cells were performed with the aREA algorithm(37).
ViroTreat analysis. ViroTreat was performed by computing the en-

richment of the top/bottom 50 most differentially active proteins
in response to drug perturbation—the context-specific mechanism
of action—on the virus-induced protein activity signature using the
aREA algorithm(37). P-values for significantly negative enrichment
were estimated using 1-tail aREA analysis, and multiple hypothesis
testing was controlled by the Bonferroni’s correction.
Code availability. All the code used in this work is freely available

for research purposes. VIPER and aREA algorithms are part of the
“viper” R-system’s package available from Bioconductor. The lung
adenocarcinoma context-specific interactome is available as part of
the “aracne.networks” R-system’s package from Bioconductor.

Methods
Cell lines. NCI-H1793 cells were obtained from ATCC (CRL-

5896), mycoplasm tested and maintained in DMEM:F12 medium
supplemented with 5 µg/ml insulin, 10 µg/ml transferrin, 30 nM
sodium selenite, 10 nM β-estradiol, 4.5 mM L-glutamine and 5%
fetal bovine serum. Cells were grown in a humidified incubator at
37°C and 5% CO2 .
Lung epithelium context-specific drug mechanism of action
database. The drug-perturbation dataset was generated as follows.

First, the ED20 for each of the 133 FDA-approved drugs and
195 investigational compounds in oncology was estimated in NCIH1793 cells by performing 10-point dose-response curves in triplicate, using total ATP content as read-out. Briefly, 2,000 cells per
well were plated in 384-well plates. Small-molecule compounds
were added with a 96-well pin-tool head 12h after cell plating. Viable cells were quantified 48h later by ATP assay (CellTiterGlo,

Supplementary Table 3. FDA-approved drugs and investigational compounds identified by ViroTreat as significantly in-

verting the SARS-CoV ViroCheckpoint (p < 10−10 , BC, 1-tail aREA test). The drugs/compounds were sorted according
to ViroTreat-inferred statistical significance as inverters of SARS-CoV 12h-, 24h- and 48h-ViroCheckpoints. The table lists
the drug/compound name, FDA-approval status, concentration used to perturb the NCI-H1793 lung adenocarcinoma cells,
ViroTreat-estimated statistical significance—expressed as –log10 (p-value)—and know primary targets.
