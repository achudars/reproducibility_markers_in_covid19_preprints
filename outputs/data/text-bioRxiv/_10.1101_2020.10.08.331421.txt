ABSTRACT
Between April 20, 2020 and June 19, 2020 we conducted a survey of the membership of the
Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) to explore the impact of COVID-19 on their research
and academic careers. A total of 123 individuals responded representing academic ranks from
trainee to full professor, tenured and fixed-term appointments, and all genders. The survey
included both quantitative and free text responses. Results revealed considerable concern
about the impact of COVID-19 on research with the greatest concern reported by individuals in
non-permanent positions and female researchers. Concerns about the availability of funding
and the impact of the pandemic on career progression were commonly reported by early career
researchers. We provide recommendations for institutions, organizations such as the PGC, as
well as individual senior investigators to ensure that the futures of early career investigators,
especially those underrepresented in academic medicine such as women and underrepresented
minorities, are not disproportionately disadvantaged by the COVID-19 pandemic.

INTRODUCTION
Since the initial outbreak in December 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has
mushroomed into a global pandemic affecting every aspect of life. In an effort to reduce
transmission, many governments, universities, and other research institutions issued work from
home orders for non-essential workers. Interruptions were widespread on both work and home
fronts. Researchers or their family members were infected by COVID-19, schools were closed
leaving little time or space for work, and the unpredictability of the course of the pandemic led
to persistent anxiety and distress for most people in the world.
Specifically, many clinician-researchers were seconded to COVID-related clinical duties; patient
facing research was halted or postponed; many basic science researchers were mandated to
halt all laboratory-based activities; and academic medical centers faced enormous financial
consequences (Colenda, Applegate, Reifler, & Blazer, 2020; Kim et al., 2020; Weissman, Klump,
& Rose, 2020). In person teaching was suspended requiring rapid adaptation to remote
teaching platforms. In addition, other academic activities, such as conferences and face-to-face
meetings, were cancelled or transitioned to virtual formats, interrupting training, networking,
and other means of scientific information exchange. Several studies have documented
challenges that have been faced by academics at different career levels, different genders, and
different family structures, and concerns have been raised, especially for early-career
researchers and women regarding the long-term impact of the pandemic on their career
progression (Denfeld et al., 2020).
As a service especially to our early career researchers, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium
(PGC) wanted to better understand the effects of COVID-19 on its members and their research.

We modeled our questionnaire after Weissman et al (Weissman et al., 2020) and assessed: (a)
the impact of COVID-19 on PGC research now and in the foreseeable future; (b) the level of
concern about COVID-19-related disruptions of research and the potential impact of these
disruptions on individuals' careers; (c) strategies that respondents thought to be effective in
coping with COVID-19-related research disruptions; and (d) respondents' suggestions for how
the PGC or the field should respond to help researchers move through and beyond the current
crisis.
To address these aims, we administered an anonymous survey containing both quantitative and
free text responses to PGC researchers. Quantitative questions focused on the perceived
impact of COVID-19-related research disruptions. We hypothesized that respondents in secure
employment positions (e.g., with tenure or permanent contracts) would report less stress and
less concern about potential adverse impact of COVID-19 on their research and career, than
respondents at earlier stages in their career (e.g., tenure-track or fixed-term contracts, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students). The primary goal of the qualitative, free text questions
was to describe participants' strategies or suggestions, and highlight issues that they felt were
important that we had not addressed. We had no hypotheses regarding the free text responses.

METHODS
Sample and procedures
All members of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) identified by the consortium listserv
were invited to participate in the survey. Invitations were sent through the main PGC listserv,

through individual Workgroup listservs, and were promoted during regular PGC
videoconferences. The survey was launched on April 20, 2020 and closed on June 19, 2020.
Qualtrics was used to administer and store the survey. This study was approved by the
University of North Carolina Institutional Review Board Committee for the Protection of Human
Subjects.
Description of the Survey
This mixed-methods survey was composed of 14 Likert-scale items measuring concern about
COVID-19 disruptions (rated from 0 = no concern to 10 = extreme concern) and highest level of
stress experienced since the outbreak of the pandemic (0 = no stress to 10 =highest level of
stress imaginable). One item asked respondents to characterize the proportion of their PGCrelated research that had to be completely shut down due to COVID-19, using six options (from
0 to up to 100% in 20% increments). Three categorical items (yes, no, do not know/does not
apply) addressed whether studies had been transferred to online; whether researchers were
anticipating making changes to their research practices; and whether their institution had made
policy changes in response to COVID-19. Each categorical item was followed by open-ended
questions inviting further expansion of answers. Participants could provide up to three openended responses when asked about strategies they found most effective for dealing with
COVID-19 in terms of their research, changes the PGC research community should make to
support researchers during and post-COVID-19, and changes the PGC should make to support
researchers during and post-COVID-19. A final open-ended question invited commentary on
questions that we did not ask.

Demographic data were collected in a final set of questions. Participants were asked to report
their gender (Female, Male, Gender variant/nonconforming, choose not to answer), current
position (“Faculty appointment (>5 years post training)”, “Faculty appointment (up to 5 years
post training) (Early Career Researcher)”, “Graduate student”, “Post-doctoral fellow”,
“Resident”, “Other”), type of position (“A position that could lead to tenure or a permanent
contract, but I have not yet reached this status”, “A position that is not in the tenure track or
permanent contract system”, “A tenured or permanent contract position”, “other”),
department/institution/organization of their primary appointment (Genetics, Government
Organization, Medicine [other than psychiatry], Non-academic Hospital or Clinic, Other,
Psychiatry, Psychology, Public Health, Research Institute), and the country where they hold
their primary research appointment (a drop-down menu of countries in the world).
Data Analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated for quantitative items using R (R Core Team, 2020). Chisquare tests and analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to test hypotheses that individuals
would differ on the basis of type of academic position and gender. For analyses on gender, only
male and female respondents were used due to small sample sizes of other respondents. A
stringent significance threshold of p < 0.005 was used to account for multiple testing
throughout the study. In addition, Cohen's d were used to estimate effect sizes.
Responses to open-ended questions were grouped into thematic categories, as follows. For
each open-ended question, the first author independently developed a set of themes to
capture the responses. Each theme was required to capture at least three responses to the

open-ended question. Because the goal of reporting the open-ended responses was strictly
descriptive, we made no attempt at establishing reliability of the coding of major themes.
RESULTS
Sample Description
A total of 123 individuals completed the survey, with a majority of respondents being female (n
= 66, 53.7%) compared to male (n = 48, 39.0%) and gender variant/nonconforming or
unreported (n = 8, 6.5%) (Table 1). The majority of respondents more held permanent/tenured
positions (n = 69, 56.1%) compared to non-permanent faculty (n = 25, 20.3%), trainees (n = 18,
14.6%) or “other” positions (n = 5, 4.1%). Six respondents (4.8%) did not specify their academic
position (Table 1).
Of those who did report their position, a majority held primary research appointments in
psychiatry (n = 63, 53.8%) or genetics (n = 26, 22.2%). The remaining respondents indicated
various other departments (medicine, psychology, public health), research institutes, or nonacademic hospitals. Academic appointments were most commonly in the United States (n = 49,
41.9%), followed by United Kingdom, n = 10; Germany, n = 7; Sweden, n = 7; Australia, n = 4;
Denmark, n = 4; Canada, n = 3; Brazil, n < 3; Greece, n < 3; Italy, n < 3; Mexico, n < 3;
Netherlands, n < 3; Spain, n < 3; Switzerland, n < 3; Afghanistan, n < 3; Austria, n < 3; Estonia, n
< 3; Japan, n < 3; New Zealand, n < 3; Norway, n < 3; Romania, n < 3; South Africa, n < 3. Ten
individuals (8.6%) not report the country of their appointment.

A significantly greater proportion of men (n = 37, 77.0% of male sample) reported holding a
permanent appointment compared to women (n = 30, 45.5% of female sample) (c! (3, 113) =
14.5, p = 0.002).
Quantitative Data
COVID-19 Effects on Research Capacity
As shown in Table 1, the largest proportion of participants (34.2%) reported that 20% of their
research was shut down due to COVID-19. A total of 31.6% of respondents reported no
shutdown of their research, many respondents in this category emphasized that their work was
mostly on archived data. A total of 4.3% of respondents reported their research to be totally
(up to 100%) shut down.
Among those who reported any research disruptions (n = 80, 68.4% of the total sample), some
reported being able to transition their studies to online settings (n = 18, 22.5%), whereas others
(n = 26, 32.5%) reported not having the need to move their studies online due to the nature of
their work being theoretical or secondary data analyses. Further, the majority of respondents
who indicated “up to 80%” or “up to 100%” of their research was shut down due to COVID-19
restriction (n = 12) were more likely to also report they were unable to move their research
work to an online setting (n = 10).
Research and Career-Related Concerns
Tables 2 and 3 present research related concerns stratified by academic position (Table 2) and
gender (Table 3). On average, the highest levels (mean ³ 5.0) of research-related concern were
related to cancellation of career opportunities, securing future funding, recruitment, and data

collection. Intermediate levels of concern (5.0 > mean ³ 3.0) were disruptions from having to
work from home (both technological and domestic concerns), staffing, transferring
teaching/supervision to remote/online, budget, and obtaining institutional approvals. Specific
problems related to supply procurement (mean = 2.95) and animal research (mean = 1.27)
ranked lowest among respondents. There were no significant differences in research-related
concerns between appointment groups. However, when stratified by gender, women report
significantly greater concerns regarding domestic issues around disruptions from having to
work from home (p = 0.001).
Overall, the impact of COVID-19 on career was an intermediate concern (mean = 4.8). However,
very large and highly significant differences emerged in career concerns, with trainees and nontenured faculty reporting higher levels of concern compared to those with permanent positions
(p = 2.90E-04, d = 1.37). Moreover, women reported greater levels of career concerns, of
medium effect size, compared to men (p = 8.01E-03, d = 0.56).
Stress levels displayed similar patterns as career impact. Stress levels were high among all
respondents (mean = 6.3), with higher levels reported among those with non-tenured positions
(p = 0.009, d = 2.51) and by females (p = 1.59E-03, d = 0.62).
Changes to Future Research Practices
A minority (n = 33, 28.2%) of respondents expected no changes would be made to their
research moving forward as a result of COVID-19, while the majority (n = 49, 41.9%) thought it
was “too soon to tell” if any changes need to be made (Table 1). There was no significant
difference across positions regarding the future practices of PGC research (p = 0.007).

Institutional Policy Changes
A full 38.5% of respondents reported that there would be no changes in performance
evaluations at their institutions related to COVID-19, with approximately one-third of
respondents (31.6%) indicated changes, and 29.9% reporting that it was too soon to tell (Table
1).
Qualitative Data
Table 4 displays findings for the free-text responses, the total number of comments entered for
each question, the key themes reflected in those comments, and examples for each of the
themes. The examples capture statements in abbreviated and paraphrased form, consistent
with our consent statement indicating that we would summarize responses rather than provide
specific individual examples.
Effective strategies for dealing with COVID-19-related research challenges
Respondents were asked to provide “1-3 effective strategies for dealing with COVID-19 in terms
of your PGC research,” which yielded 125 responses. Four main themes characterized the
comments: maintain team dynamics (e.g., utilizing videoconferencing for regular team
meetings, being flexible with deadlines, use clear communication) (32.8% of responses);
maintain good personal habits (e.g., keeping in mind productivity may be reduced, practicing
self-care, keeping work and personal areas separate) (27.2%); reprioritize research goals (e.g.,
spending more effort on dry-lab projects rather than wet-lab, using available time to complete
analyses or manuscripts, utilizing existing data for new projects) (20.8%); and shift recruitment

to online approaches (e.g., phone interviews rather than face-to-face, development of online
recruitment and consent protocols) (8.0%).
Effective strategies for transitioning to online settings
Two themes emerged from the 24 responses to the prompt, “effective strategies for
transitioning your PGC research to online settings.” Both themes employ technological
approaches to: maintain contact with research participants (e.g., using online questionnaires
and other remote means for recruitment and consent) (41.7%) and support activities of the
research team (e.g., establishing connections to remote databases, regular teleconferencing
with colleagues) (33.3%).
Anticipated changes to PGC research practices post-COVID-19
The 39 responses to the prompt “describe 1-3 changes you expect to make in your PGC
research practices” could be grouped into five themes: move to remote recruitment (e.g.,
phone/online recruitment, saliva rather than blood sample collection) (25.6%); increased use of
virtual meetings (e.g., video conferencing for in lieu of lab or scientific meetings) (23.1%);
organizational changes (e.g., expectations for decreased budget, reduced personnel) (15.4%);
increased protective measures when collecting samples in-person (e.g., increased PPE for blood
draws) (12.8%); and shifting research priorities (e.g. add COVID-19 as a research focus) (10.3%).
Changes PGC should make to support research during and after COVID-19
When asked to “describe 1-3 changes the PGC should make to support PGC researchers during
and after COVID-19” 74 responses were provided. These comments fell into six common
themes: continue to support remote meetings (e.g. virtual World Congress of Psychiatric

Genetics annual meeting, worldwide lab meetings) (17.6%), facilitate more secondary analyses
(e.g. making data access easier, increasing time frame on existing proposals, prioritize data
access for junior researchers) (16.2%), offer greater support to early career researchers (e.g.
advocate for junior researchers, create support groups for early career researchers) (14.9%),
provide support for researchers directly impacted by COVID-19 (e.g. leniency for those who see
patients and other caregivers, support career advancement for those directly affected by
COVID-19) (10.8%) , provide funding to support researchers (e.g. bridge funding to sustain PGC
research especially among junior researchers and those not part of core PGC funding) (10.8%),
and provide online training (e.g. statistical genetics and other key topic courses) (8.1%).
Institutional policy changes regarding performance evaluation of researchers
Of the 29 answers to the prompt, “Briefly describe your institution's policy changes about
performance evaluations of researchers,” by far, the most reported change was an extension of
performance evaluation periods (65.5% of responses), specifically extending the tenure clock by
one year.
Questions the survey should have asked
Seventeen comments were made in response to the question “Is there a question about COVID19's impact on your PGC research that we should have asked but didn't?” There were two
themes that met a minimum of three comments per theme. First, respondents indicated that
we should have asked questions regarding clinical researchers and how their practice has
shifted to support COVID-19 patients (17.6% of responses). Second, respondents wanted more

questions into how broader shutdowns (e.g., school closings, unemployment, work from home)
have affected productivity, specifically childcare (17.6% of responses).

DISCUSSION
Overall, our survey revealed high stress and concern about the impact of COVID-19 on their
careers especially in individuals with non-permanent positions and in women. Our results are
consistent with those reported across various academic fields (Andersen, Nielsen, Simone,
Lewiss, & Jagsi 2020; Brubaker, 2020; Denfeld et al., 2020; Kibbe, 2020; Weissman et al., 2020),
and highlight steps that can and should be taken to ensure the ability of early career
researchers and female academics not only to survive but to thrive post-pandemic.

Results of the PGC survey align with other surveys reported in the literature that reveal the
disproportionate impact that COVID-19-related interruptions have had on female researchers.
From having primary responsibility for childcare at home while trying to work from home to
concerns about an advancing tenure clock when their productivity is hampered by pandemicrelated disruptions, women do appear to be more stressed and more directly impacted than
men. This augments the already disproportionate burden of domestic and emotional labor
shouldered by female academics (Brubaker, 2020; Jolly et al., 2014; Rao, 2019). Other studies
confirm this observation including a disproportionate number of male first authors in papers
submitted to journals on COVID-19 (Andersen et al., 2020), journal submissions and
productivity in general (Viglione, 2020), and projections of serious interruptions of career

progress for women that could adversely affect progress toward gender equity in academe
(Sheikh et al., 2018).

A surprising number of institutions were not intending to make allowances on performance
evaluations or tenure clocks. This is of significant concern, especially given the documented
differential burden placed on junior female faculty in their childbearing years who are
entrusted with the majority of childcare duties (Jolly et al., 2014). Senior mentors, institutions,
and scientific organizations like the PGC should actively develop and deploy measures to
support the careers of junior researchers and those of all genders who have had to take on
additional child- or elder-care burdens during this time.

Likewise, although we did not assess ancestry, it has been widely documented in the United
States that individuals from underrepresented minority groups have been disproportionately
affected by COVID-19 (Moore et al., 2020), which means that not only might more minority
researchers be directly affected by COVID-19, but they are also more likely to have connections
in socially vulnerable communities and have family members and members of their
communities impacted (Nayak et al., 2020). This can divert both time and emotional energy
away from career progress and further perpetuate existing systemic inequities in academe
(Davis & Fry, 2019).

In many years to come, evaluations of productivity and hiring decisions should explicitly address
and account for disruptions encountered during this time. Although many institutions have
14

implemented a single-year extension of tenure clocks, that may not suffice given the prolonged
nature of the pandemic. Applications should include the opportunity to describe the impact of
the pandemic on an applicant’s life such that it can be factored into the evaluation of the
candidate. It is critically important that COVID-19 not set back progress toward equity in science
and academe in general, but definitive action must be taken in order to ensure that outcome.

Some caveats and limitations should be considered when interpreting the results. First, the
extent to which our sample represents the larger PGC is unknown as we are unable to calculate
response rate or representativeness as the survey link was shared widely across PGC groups
and subgroups. The composition of the sample, namely primarily female (53.7% of total
sample) and in a permanent/tenured position (56.1%), does not necessarily reflect the overall
composition of the PGC and may reflect selective participation. Second, given our goal of
providing strictly descriptive results, we did not undertake formal efforts at establishing a
coding scheme for the free text responses. Third, the survey was deployed relatively early in the
pandemic when it was not yet clear how long the disruption to research would go on.
Responses could change as the duration of the home- and work-related disruption continues
and researchers become increasingly fatigued by the pervasive and persistent disruption.
Finally, our failure to assess race and ethnicity was a missed opportunity to capture specific
concerns faced by researchers from underrepresented minority groups. As a field, genetics
already has considerable underrepresentation of researchers from diverse ancestral
backgrounds; our findings for other historically disadvantaged groups (e.g., women, early

career investigators) suggest that the pandemic may further exacerbate this
underrepresentation.

Recurring themes that emerged focused on the cancellation of career opportunities in terms of
networking, but also the financial impact of COVID-19 on job availability as many institutions
have implemented hiring freezes. This along with personal economic instability, and concerns
about the availability of sources of future research funding lead many researchers to question
their future job prospects and the viability of remaining in academe. Many respondents
expressed desire for the PGC and senior investigations to devise ways to help boost productivity
and success in publications and grant applications—basically devoting greater energy to
ensuring the success of early career researchers during this time. The disproportionate
underrepresentation of women at higher academic ranks (Carr et al., 2018) is a known
phenomenon in many fields of academic medicine, especially for women. It is a critical juncture
to ensure that we can shore up promising young investigators such that we can retain them in
science and not erase the albeit slow and incremental advances that we have seen in striving
for equity in academe (Wingard, Trejo, Gudea, Goodman, & Reznik, 2019).

Table 4. Responses to free text questions
Number of comments recorded and themes and illustrative (shortened, paraphrased)
Statements identified by open-ended questions.
Please share your 1–3 most effective strategies for dealing with COVID-19 in terms of your PGC research. (125 comments)
1. Maintain team dynamics (41 / 125, 32.8%)
Utilizing videoconferencing for regular team meetings, being flexible with deadlines, use clear communication
2. Maintain good personal habits (34 / 125, 27.2%)
Keeping in mind productivity may be reduced, practicing self-care, keeping work and personal areas separate
3. Reprioritizing research goals (26 / 125, 20.8%)
Spend more effort on dry-lab projects rather than wet-lab, use available time to complete analyses or manuscripts, utilizing existing data for new projects
4. Shifting recruitment to online means (11 / 125, 8.0%)
Phone interviews rather than face-to-face, development of online recruitment and consent protocols
Please share your 1–3 most effective strategies for transitioning your PGC research to online settings. (Respondents were instructed to skip the question if they had not made such a transition) (24
comments)
1. Use techology to maintain contact with research participants (10 / 24, 41.7%)
Using online questionnaires and other remote means for recruitment and consent
2. Use technology to support activities of the research team (8 / 24, 33.3%)
Establishing connections to remote databases, regular teleconferencing with colleagues
Please describe 1–3 changes you expect to make in your PGC research practices as a result of COVID-19. (Respondents were instructed to skip the question if they did not anticipate making changes
or had checked “it's too soon to tell”) (39 comments)
1. Moving to remote recruitment (10 / 39, 25.6%)
Phone/online recruitment, saliva rather than blood sample collection
2. Increased use of virtual meetings (9 / 39, 23.1%)
Video conferencing for in lieu of lab or scientific meetings
3. Organizational changes (6 / 39, 15.4%)
Expectations for decreased budget, reduced personnel
4. Increased protective measures when collecting samples in-person (5 / 39, 12.8%)
Increased PPE for blood draws
5. Shifting research priorities (4 / 39, 10.3%)
Add COVID-19 as a research focus
Please describe 1-3 changes the PGC should make to support PGC researchers during and after COVID-19. (74 comments)
1. Continue to support remote meetings (13 / 74, 17.6%)
Virtual World Congress of Psychiatric Genetics annual meeting, worldwide lab meetings
2. Facilitate more secondary analyses (12 / 74, 16.2%)
Making data access easier, increasing time frame on existing proposals, prioritize data access for junior researchers
3. Offer greater support to early career researchers (11 / 74, 14.9%)
Advocate for junior researchers, create support groups for early career researchers
4. Provide support for researchers directly impacted by COVID-19 (8 / 74, 10.8%)
Leniency for those who see patients and other caregivers, support career advancement for those directly affected by COVID-19
5. Provide funding to support researchers (8 / 74, 10.8%)
Bridge funding to sustain PGC research especially among junior researchers and those not part of core PGC funding
6. Provide online training (6 / 74, 8.1)
Statistical genetics and other key topic courses
Is there a question about COVID-19's impact on your PGC research that we should have asked but didn't? (17 comments)
1. We should have asked questions regarding clinical researchers and how their practice has shifted to support COVID-19 patients (3 / 17, 17.6%)
2. Respondents wanted more questions into how broader shutdowns (e.g. school closings, unemployment, work from home) have affected productivity, specifically childcare (3 / 17, 17.6%)
