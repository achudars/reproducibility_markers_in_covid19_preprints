Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects cells at mucosal surfaces. Serum neutralizing antibody

24

responses are variable and generally low in individuals that suffer mild forms of the illness.

25

Although potent IgG antibodies can neutralize the virus, less is known about secretory antibodies

26

such as IgA that might impact the initial viral spread and transmissibility from the mucosa. Here

27

we characterize the IgA response to SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 149 individuals. IgA responses

28

in plasma generally correlate with IgG responses and clones of IgM, IgG and IgA producing B

29

cells that are derived from common progenitors are evident. Plasma IgA monomers are 2-fold

30

less potent than IgG equivalents. However, IgA dimers, the primary form in the nasopharynx, are

31

on average 15 times more potent than IgA monomers. Thus, secretory IgA responses may be

32

particularly valuable for protection against SARS-CoV-2 and for vaccine efficacy.

34

Introduction

35

SARS-CoV-2 encodes a trimeric spike surface protein (S) which mediates entry into host cells

36

(1, 2). The virus initially infects epithelial cells in the nasopharynx when the receptor binding

37

domain (RBD) of S interacts with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor (3-6).

38

SARS-CoV-2 may subsequently spread to other epithelial cells expressing ACE-2 in the lung

39

and gut. These tissues are rich in lymphoid cells that are organized into nasopharynx associated

40

and gut associated lymphoid tissues (NALT and GALT respectively). Vaccines delivered by

41

inhalation to specifically target these tissues appear to be more effective against SARS-CoV-2

42

(7). Among other specializations, NALT and GALT produce large quantities of IgA antibodies.

43

These antibodies exist as monomers in circulation where they make up 15% of the serum

44

antibody pool. However, IgA is found in higher concentrations in secretions where it exists

45

predominantly as a dimer covalently linked by J chain (8-10).

47

Although most individuals produce antibodies in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the

48

neutralizing response is highly variable with as many as 30% of the population showing levels of

49

neutralizing activity below 1:50 in pseudovirus assays (11, 12). Neutralization is associated with

50

prolonged infection and RBD binding activity as measured by ELISA (11-13). IgG antibody

51

cloning experiments from recovered individuals have revealed that neutralizing antibodies target

52

several distinct non-overlapping epitopes on the RBD (11, 14-18). Some of these antibodies are

53

potently neutralizing and can prevent or treat infection in animal models (15-19).

54
55

Consistent with the fact that SARS CoV-2 initially infects in the nasopharynx, IgA antibodies

56

that bind to SARS-CoV-2 are produced rapidly after infection and remain elevated in the plasma

57

for at least 40 days after the onset of symptoms (20-23). IgA antibodies bind to the RBD and can

58

neutralize SARS-CoV-2 (20-22). However, the precise contribution and molecular nature of the

59

IgA response to SARS-CoV-2 has not been reported to date. Here we examine a cohort of 149

60

convalescent individuals with measurable plasma neutralizing activity for the contribution of IgA

61

to anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses. Cloning IgA antibodies from single B cells reveals that

62

the neutralizing activity of monomeric IgA is generally lower than corresponding IgGs but

63

dimeric IgAs are on average 15-fold more potent than their monomeric counterparts.

69

examine the contribution of IgA to the anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD response we tested plasma

70

samples for binding to the RBD by a validated ELISA. A positive control sample (COV-21) was

71

included for normalization of the area under the curve (AUC) and 8 independent healthy donor

72

samples were included as negative controls (Fig. 1A, (11)). Whereas 78% and 15% of the

73

individuals in this cohort showed IgG and IgM anti-RBD levels that were at least 2 standard

74

deviations above control, only 33% did so for IgA (Fig. 1A and B, (11)). Thus, in individuals

75

studied on average 40 days after infection the circulating levels of anti-RBD IgA is more modest

76

than IgG and higher than IgM.

77
78

Anti-RBD IgA titers were correlated with duration and severity of symptoms but not timing of

79

sample collection relative to onset (Fig. 1C, and fig.S1A, B). Similar to IgG, females had lower

80

levels of IgA than males and hospitalized individuals showed higher anti-RBD IgA titers than

81

those with milder symptoms, but there was no correlation with age (Fig. 1D and E, fig. S1C). Of

82

note, individuals that suffered gastrointestinal symptoms showed significantly higher plasma

83

anti-RBD IgA but not IgG titers (Fig. 1F and fig. S1D).

84
85

Neutralization activity of purified IgG and IgA

86

To compare the neutralizing activity of plasma IgA to IgG directly we purified the 2 isotypes

87

from the plasma of all 99 individuals in our cohort that showed measurable plasma neutralizing

88

activity and tested the two isotypes in HIV-1 based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization

89

assays (11). The activity of both isotypes was directly correlated with anti-RBD binding titers

90

and overall plasma neutralizing activity (Fig. 2A-D). In addition, there was good correlation

91

between the neutralizing activity of IgG and IgA in a given individual (Fig. 2E). However,

92

potency of each of the 2 isotypes varied by as much as 2 orders of magnitude between

93

individuals (Fig. 2F). Purified IgG was generally more potent than IgA in neutralizing SARS-

94

CoV-2 pseudovirus in vitro. The geometric mean IC50 for IgG was 384 nM vs. 709 nM for IgA

95

(P < 0.0001, Fig. 2F). Nevertheless, IgAs were more potent than IgGs in 25% of the individuals

96

tested (fig. S2A). The 2 isotypes also differed in that the overall potency of purified IgG was

97

correlated with symptom severity and was higher in hospitalized individuals, but purified IgA

98

was not (Fig. 2G and fig. S2B- D). Finally, the potency of the purified IgA was greater in

99

individuals that suffered from gastrointestinal symptoms, but IgG was not (Fig. 2H and fig. S2E).

100
101

Monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgA antibodies

102

To determine the nature of the IgM and IgA anti-RBD antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2

103

infection we used flow cytometry to purify single B lymphocytes that bind to RBD and cloned

104

their antibodies. We obtained 109 IgM and 74 IgA (64 IgA1 and 10 IgA2) matched Ig heavy and

105

light chain sequences by reverse transcription and subsequent isotype specific PCR from 3

106

convalescent individuals (Fig. 3A, B). As reported for IgG antibodies (11, 14, 17, 26, 29), the

107

overall number of mutations was generally low when compared to antibodies obtained from

108

individuals suffering from chronic infections such as Hepatitis-B or HIV-1 (30, 31) (fig. S3A,

109

B). However, the number of V gene nucleotide mutations in IgM and IgA heavy and light chains

110

varied between individuals. For example, in donor COV21 the number of IgM and IgA heavy

111

chain mutations was similar. In contrast, IgM heavy and light chain nucleotide mutations were

112

significantly greater than IgA mutations in COV47 (fig. S3B). CDR3 length was significantly

113

shorter for IgM than IgA and IgG antibodies and hydrophobicity was slightly higher for IgM

114

over control but not for IgA and IgG (figs. S4 and S5). Compared to the normal human antibody

115

repertoire, several IgA and IgM VH genes were over-represented including VH3-53 which can

116

make key contacts with the RBD through germline encoded CDRH1 and CDRH2 (11, 32, 33)

117

(fig. S6).

118
119

Like IgG antibodies (11) IgA and IgM antibodies were found in expanded clones in all 3 of the

120

individuals examined. Overall 66.2% and 66.1% of all the IgA and IgM sequences examined

121

were members of expanded clones (Fig. 3A, B and table S1). Nearly identical sequences were

122

shared among the 3 isotypes in clones found in all 3 individuals indicating that switch

123

recombination occurred during B cell clonal expansion in response to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.3B). In

124

total 11 out of 55 antigen-specific B cell clones in circulation belonged to expanded clones that

125

contained members expressing different constant regions (Fig. 3C and tables S1 and S2). When

126

compared directly, the neutralizing activity of antibodies that were members of B cell clones

127

producing IgA or IgG varied and did not correlate with one or the other isotype (table S3).

128
129

To examine the binding properties of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonals we expressed 46 IgMs

130

and 35 IgAs (table S4). IgM variable regions were produced on an IgG1 backbone to facilitate

131

expression and purification. IgAs were expressed as native IgA1 or IgA2 monomers. ELISA

132

assays on RBD showed that 100% and 91.3% of the IgA and IgM antibodies bound to the RBD

133

with an average half-maximal effective concentration of 52.8 ng/ml and 101.6 ng/ml respectively

134

(fig. S7A and table S5).

135
136

To determine neutralizing activity of the IgM and IgA antibodies we tested them against an HIV-

137

1 based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus as IgGs and native IgA monomers respectively. Among the

138

42 RBD binding IgM antibodies tested we found 10 that neutralized the virus in the ng/ml range

139

with geometric mean half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 114.0 nanograms per

140

milliliter (Fig. 4A and fig. S7B, table S5). In contrast, 32 out of 35 RBD binding IgA antibodies

141

tested neutralized the virus in the ng/ml range with geometric mean half-maximal inhibitory

142

concentrations (IC50) of 53.6 nanograms per milliliter (Fig. 4A and fig. S7B, table S5). Thus,

143

IgM antibodies expressed as monomeric IgGs show lower neutralizing activity than either native

144

IgA or IgG monomers (Fig. 4A).

145
146

Dimeric anti- SARS-CoV-2 IgA is more potent than monomeric IgA

147

To determine whether these IgAs targeted the same epitopes as previously characterized IgGs we

148

performed bilayer interferometry experiments in which a preformed antibody-RBD complex

149

consisting of C144-RBD, or C121-RBD or C135-RBD or CR3022-RBD (Fig. 4B) was exposed

150

to a monomeric IgA monoclonal. C144 and C121 recognize the ACE-2 interaction domain of the

151

RBD, C135 and CR3022 neutralize without interfering with ACE-2 binding (Fig. 4C) (11, 32,

152

34). Two of the IgA’s were in the C144 category, 5 were similar to C121, and 2 resembled C135

153

(Fig. 4C and fig. S9). Thus, RBD recognition by neutralizing IgA is similar to IgG.

154
155

Mucosal IgA exists predominantly as a dimer. To examine the neutralizing activity of IgA

156

dimers we co-expressed 8 IgA1s and 1 IgA2 with J chain to produce mixtures of monomers and

157

dimers that were purified by size exclusion chromatography (fig. S8). When compared in

158

pseudovirus neutralization assays, 8 out of 9 IgA dimers were more potent than the

159

corresponding monomers with differences in activity ranging from 3.8 to 113-fold (Fig. 4D, fig.

160

S10A and table S6). The relative increase in neutralizing activity between monomer and dimer

161

was inversely correlated with the neutralizing activity of the monomer in this assay (fig. S10B.

162

IC50: r=0.80, P=0.014). For example, whereas C437, the most potent antibody, showed

163

equivalent activity as a monomer and dimer, C408, one of the least potent antibodies, was 113-

164

fold more potent as a dimer (fig. S10B).

165
166

IgA monomers and dimers were also compared in SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization assays.

167

Neutralizing activities of the 9 monomers and 9 dimers correlated strongly with those measured

168

in the pseudovirus neutralization assay (fig. S10C. IC50: r=0.84, P<0.0001; IC90: r=0.91,

169

P<0.0001). On average, there was a 15-fold geometric mean increase in activity for the dimer

170

over the monomer against SARS-CoV-2 and less variability in the degree of enhancement in

171

microneutralization compared to pseudovirus assays (Fig. 4D, fig. S10D and E, and table S6).

172

Thus, dimeric IgA is far more potent than monomeric IgA against SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4D).

173
174

Discussion

175

Neutralizing antibody titers are the best correlates of protection in most vaccines (35). Among

176

antibody isotypes, secretory IgA which is found at mucosal surfaces, plays a crucial role in

177

protecting against pathogens that target these surfaces (36). We find that serum IgA responses to

178

SARS-CoV-2 correlate with IgG responses. Although the monomeric form of IgA found in

179

serum is on average 2-fold less potent than IgG, the dimeric secretory form of IgA found in

180

mucosa is over one log more potent than the monomer against authentic SARS-CoV-2 which

181

makes it a far more potent neutralizer than IgG.

182

183

The increased potency of the dimeric form of IgA suggests that crosslinking the S protein on the

184

viral surface enhances neutralizing activity either directly or simply through increased apparent

185

affinity. This observation is consistent with the finding that monovalent Fab fragments of serum

186

IgG antibodies are far less potent than the intact antibody (32). Whether this effect is due to

187

inter- or intra-spike crosslinking is not known, but it indicates that antibodies or drugs designed

188

to block entry by binding to the RBD could be made more potent by increasing their valency.

189
190

A number of different candidate vaccines to SARS-CoV-2 are currently being evaluated in the

191

clinic. Secretory IgA responses may be particularly important to these efforts in that potent

192

dimeric forms of these antibodies are found at the mucosal surfaces where cells are initially

193

targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Thus, even vaccines that elicit modest neutralizing activity in serum

194

may be protective because the secretory polymeric forms of antibodies in mucosa can neutralize

195

the virus. Vaccines that are specifically designed to elicit mucosal IgA responses may be

196

particularly effective preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (7).

Human Study participants

406

Samples were obtained from 149 individuals under a study protocol approved by the Rockefeller University in New

407

York from April 1 through May 8, 2020 as described in (11). All participants provided written informed consent

408

before participation in the study and the study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and clinical

409

data collection. The study was performed in compliance with all relevant ethical regulations and the protocol was

410

approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Rockefeller University.

411
412

Purification and quantification of IgA and IgG from plasma

413

IgA and IgG were purified from samples with measurable neutralizing activity, against SARS-CoV-2-RBD (11).

414

300µl of plasma was diluted with PBS heat-inactivated (56℃ for 1 hr) and incubated with peptide M/Agarose

415

(Invivogen) or Protein G/Agarose (GE lifeSciences) overnight at 4 ℃. The suspension was transferred to

416

chromatography columns and washed with 10 column volumes of 1X-PBS. IgA and IgG were then eluted with

417

1.5ml of 0.1M glycine (pH=3.0) and pH was immediately adjusted to 7.5 with 1M Tris (pH=8.0). 1X-PBS buffer

418

exchange was achieved using Amicon® Ultra centrifugal filters (Merck Millipore) through a 30-kD membrane

419

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. IgA and IgG concentrations were determined by measurement of

420

absorbance at 280nm using a NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific) instrument and samples were stored at 4℃.

421
422

ELISAs

423

ELISAs to evaluate the IgG or IgA binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were performed as previously described using a

424

validated assay (37, 38). High binding 96 half well plates (Corning #3690) were coated with 50 µL per well of a

425

1µg/mL protein solution in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed 6 times with washing buffer (1xPBS with

426

0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich)) and incubated with 170 µL blocking buffer per well (1xPBS with 2% BSA and

427

0.05% Tween20 (Sigma) for 1 hour at room temperature (RT). Immediately after blocking, monoclonal antibodies

428

or plasma samples were added in PBS and incubated for 1 hr at RT. Plasma samples were assayed at a 1:200 starting

429

dilution and seven additional 3-fold serial dilutions. Monoclonal antibodies were tested at 10 µg/ml starting

430

concentration and 10 additional 4-fold serial dilutions. Plates were washed 6 times with washing buffer and then

431

incubated with anti-human IgG (Jackson Immuno Research 109-036-088) or anti-human IgA (Sigma A0295)

432

secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in blocking buffer at 1:5000 or 1:3000 dilution

433

respectively. Plates were developed by addition of the HRP substrate, TMB (ThermoFisher) for 10 minutes (plasma

434

samples) or 4 minutes (monoclonal antibodies), then the developing reaction was stopped by adding 50µl 1M

435

H2SO4. ODs were measured at 450 nm in a microplate reader (FluoStar Omega, BMG Labtech). For plasma

436

samples, a positive control (plasma from patient COV21, diluted 200-fold in PBS) and negative control historical

437

plasma samples was added in duplicate to every assay plate for validation. The average of its signal was used for

438

normalization of all the other values on the same plate with Excel software prior to calculating the area under the

439

curve using Prism 8 (GraphPad).

Cell lines

442

HT1080Ace2 cl.14 cells (27), 293TAce2 cells (11) and VeroE6 kidney epithelial cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s

443

modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS at 37 °C and 5% CO2. In addition, medium for

444

Ace2-overexpressing cell lines contained 5 µg/ml blasticidin and medium for VeroE6 cells was supplemented with 1

445

% nonessential amino acids. All cell lines have been tested negative for contamination with mycoplasma and

446

parental cell lines were obtained from the ATCC.

Pseudotyped virus neutralization assay

449

SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped particles were produced by co-transfection of pSARS-CoV-2 Strunc and pNL4-3DEnv-

450

nanoluc in 293T cells (11, 27). Four-fold serially diluted purified plasma IgG/IgA from COVID-19 convalescent

451

individuals and healthy donors or monoclonal antibodies were incubated with the SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus

452

for 1 hour at 37 °C. Subsequently, the mixture was incubated with Ace2-expressing cells for 48 hours. HT1080Ace2

453

cl. 14 cells (27) were used for plasma-derived IgG/IgA and 293TAce2 cells (11) for monoclonal antibodies. Following

454

incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with Luciferase Cell Culture Lysis 5x reagent (Promega).

455

Nanoluc Luciferase activity in lysates was measured using the Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) with a

456

GloMax Natigator Microplate Luminometer (Promega). Relative luminescence units obtained were normalized to

457

those derived from cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus in the absence of plasma-derived or

458

monoclonal antibodies. The half-maximal and 90% inhibitory concentrations for purified plasma IgG or IgA or

459

monoclonal antibodies (IC50 and IC90) were determined using 4-parameter nonlinear regression (GraphPad Prism).

Antibody sequencing, cloning and expression

463

Single B cells were isolated from COV21, COV47 and COV96 patients as previously described(11). Briefly, RNA

464

from single cells was reverse-transcribed (SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase, Invitrogen, 18080-044) using

465

random primers (Invitrogen, 48190011) and followed by nested PCR amplifications and sequencing using the

466

primers for heavy chain that are listed in (table S7) and primers light chains from (39). Sequence analysis was

467

performed with MacVector. Antibody cloning from PCR products was performed as previously described by

468

sequencing and ligation-independent cloning into antibody expression vectors (Igγ1-, IGκ-, IGλ-, Igα1 and Igα2) as

469

detailed in (40). The Igα1 and Igα2 vectors were from (Invivogen, pfusess-hcha1for IgA1 and pfusess-hcha2m1 for

470

IgA2). J chain plasmid was a gift from Susan Zolla-Pazner. Recombinant monoclonal antibodies were produced and

471

purified as previously described (39, 41). Briefly, monoclonal antibodies were produced by transient co-transfection

472

of 293-F cells with human heavy chain and light chain antibody expression plasmids using polyethylenimine (PEI)

473

(Sigma-Aldrich, catalog #408727). Seven days after transfection, supernatants were harvested, clarified by

474

centrifugation and subsequently incubated with Peptide M(Invivogen)/Protein G-coupled sepharose beads

475

(Invivogen, catalog# gel-pdm-5; GE healthcare, 17-0618-05) overnight at 4°C. For dimers, antibodies were

476

produced by transient transfection of Expi293F cells with heavy chain, light chain and J chain expression plasmids

477

at a 1:1:1 ratio. After five days, antibodies were harvested, filtered, incubated with Peptide M overnight and eluted.

Separation of Dimeric IgA from its Monomeric Form by Size Exclusion Chromatography

480

A Pre-packed HiLoad™ 16/60 Superdex™ 200 pg (Cytiva, catalog #28989335) on the NGC™ Quest 10 Plus

481

Chromatography System by Bio-Rad was calibrated at room temperature using the HMW Gel Filtration Calibration

482

Kit (Cytiva, catalog #28403842) and IgG. After equilibration of the column with PBS, each concentrated IgA

483

preparation was applied onto the column using a 1 ml-loop at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Dimers of IgA1 or IgA2

484

were separated from monomers upon an isocratic elution with 70 ml of PBS. The fractions were pooled,

485

concentrated and evaluated by SDS-PAGE using 4 –12% Bis–Tris Novex gels (GenScript catalog #M00652) under

486

reducing and non-reducing conditions followed by a Coomassie blue staining (Expedeon, catalog #ISB1L).

488

Microneutralization assay with authentic SARS-CoV-2.

489

Production of SARS-CoV-2 virus was performed as previously described (11). This assay was performed as

490

described previously (11, 42). VeroE6 cells were seeded at 1x104 cells/well into 96-well plates on the day before

491

infection. IgA monomers and dimers were serially diluted (4-fold) in BA-1, consisting of medium 199 (Lonza, Inc.)

492

supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1x penicillin/streptomycin. The diluted samples were

493

mixed with a constant amount of SARS-CoV-2 and incubated for 1hr at 37℃. The antibody-virus-mix was then

494

directly applied to VeroE6 cells (MOI of ~0.1 PFU/cell; n=3) and incubated for 22h at 37℃. Cells were

495

subsequently fixed by adding an equal volume of 7% formaldehyde to the wells, followed by permeabilization with

496

0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After extensive washing, cells were incubated for 1hr at 37℃ with blocking solution

497

of 5% goat serum in PBS (catalog no. 005–000-121; Jackson ImmunoResearch). A rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-

498

CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody (catalog no. GTX135357; GeneTex) was added to the cells at 1:1,000 dilution in

499

blocking solution and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 594 (catalog no. A-11012; Life

500

Technologies) was used as a secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:2,000. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342

501

(catalog no. 62249; Thermo Scientific) at a 1:1,000 dilution. Images were acquired with a fluorescence microscope

502

and analyzed using ImageXpress Micro XLS (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). All experiments involving

503

SARS-CoV-2 were performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory.

504
505

Biolayer interferometry

506

BLI assays were performed on the Octet Red instrument (ForteBio) at 30 °C with shaking at 1,000 r.p.m. Epitope

507

binding assays were performed with protein A biosensor (ForteBio 18-5010), following the manufacturer’s protocol

508

“classical sandwich assay”. (1) Sensor check: sensors immersed 30 sec in buffer alone (buffer ForteBio 18-1105).

509

(2) Capture 1st Ab: sensors immersed 10 min with Ab1 at 40 µg/mL. (3) Baseline: sensors immersed 30 sec in

510

buffer alone. (4) Blocking: sensors immersed 5 min with IgG isotype control at 50 µg/mL. (6) Antigen association:

511

sensors immersed 5 min with RBD at 100 µg/mL. (7) Baseline: sensors immersed 30 sec in buffer alone. (8)

512

Association Ab2: sensors immersed 5 min with Ab2 at 40 µg/mL. Curve fitting was performed using the Fortebio

513

516

Antibody sequences were trimmed based on quality and annotated using Igblastn v1.14.0[ref] with IMGT domain

517

delineation system. Annotation was performed systematically using Change-O toolkit v.0.4.5(43). Heavy and light

518

chains derived from the same cell were paired, and clonotypes were assigned based on their V and J genes using in-

519

house R and Perl scripts (Fig. 3 A and B). All scripts and the data used to process antibody sequences are publicly

520

available on GitHub (https://github.com/stratust/igpipeline). Nucleotide somatic hypermutation and CDR3 length

521

were determined using in-house R and Perl scripts. For somatic hypermutations, IGHV and IGLV nucleotide

522

sequences were aligned against their closest germlines using Igblastn and the number of differences were considered

523

nucleotide mutations. The average mutations for V genes was calculated by dividing the sum of all nucleotide

524

mutations across all patients by the number of sequences used for the analysis. Hydrophobicity distribution

525

comparisons were calculated as described in (11) (Fig. S5). The frequency distributions of human V genes in anti-

526

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from this study was compared to 131,284,220 IgH and IgL sequences generated by (44)

527

and downloaded from cAb-Rep (45), a database of human shared BCR clonotypes available at https://cab-

528

rep.c2b2.columbia.edu/. Based on the 81 distinct V genes that make up the 1455 analyzed sequences from Ig

529

repertoire of the three patients present in this study, we selected the IgH and IgL sequences from the database that

530

are partially coded by the same V genes and counted them according to the constant region. The frequencies shown

531

in (Fig. S6) are relative to the source and isotype analyzed. We used the two-sided binomial test to check whether

532

the number of sequences belonging to a specific IgHV or IgLV gene in the repertoire is different according to the

533

frequency of the same IgV gene in the database. Adjusted p-values were calculated using the false discovery rate

534

(FDR) correction. Significant differences are denoted with stars.
