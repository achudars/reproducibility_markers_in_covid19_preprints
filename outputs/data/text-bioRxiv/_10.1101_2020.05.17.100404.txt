Abstract

21

With currently over 4 million confirmed cases worldwide, including more than 300’000 deaths, the

22

current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has a major

23

impact on the economy and health care system. Currently, a limited amount of prophylactic or

24

therapeutic intervention options are available against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we screened 400

25

compounds from the antimicrobial ‘Pandemic Response Box’ library for inhibiting properties against

26

SARS-CoV-2. We identified sixteen compounds that potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication, of

27

which five compounds displayed equal or even higher antiviral activity compared to Remdesivir. These

28

results show that five compounds should be further investigated for their mode of action, safety and

29

efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

37

In December 2019, a new zoonotic coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China

38

named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is the etiological

39

agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1–3]. The clinical features of SARS-CoV-2-infected

40

patients range from mild cold-like symptoms to severe illness ultimately leading to acute respiratory

41

distress syndrome (ARDS) [2,4]. Patients at older age and with underlying comorbidities are at higher

42

risk for developing severe courses of COVID-19 [5]. Despite unprecedented international public health

43

response measures to contain SARS-CoV-2 transmissions, the viral outbreak is currently categorized

44

as a pandemic with over 4 million confirmed-laboratory cases reported worldwide, including over

45

300`000 deaths as of 8th of May 2020 [6]. At present, and despite earlier outbreaks by SARS-CoV and

46

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, there are limited approved antiviral treatment

47

options such as antiviral drugs, vaccines and immuno-prophylaxis that can be used prophylactically or

48

therapeutically to halt the current SARS-CoV-2 infections.

49

Vaccine development takes multiple years until it can be administered to patients, and

50

although these processes are expedited during outbreaks of emerging viruses, the eventual worldwide

51

vaccine distribution may be delayed for several months after the initial outbreak [7]. Moreover, while

52

vaccines are used prophylactically, antiviral drugs can be employed both prophylactically and

53

therapeutically. For SARS-CoV-2, several antiviral compounds are currently evaluated, such as the

54

nucleoside analogue Remdesivir, the TMPRSS2 protease inhibitor cameostat mesylate, and the

55

antimalaria drug (Hydroxy-) chloroquine, that target different stages of the viral replication cycle [8,9].

56

These three antiviral drugs have been recently tested clinically in small cohorts, and their efficacy

57

against SARS-CoV-2 infections is currently evaluated [10]. Nevertheless, RNA viruses, including

58

coronaviruses, are known to rapidly evade antiviral drug inhibition by developing resistance mutations

59

and subsequent selection of drug-resistant viral populations [11–13]. Therefore, the use of multiple

60

drug regimes as well as expanding the repertoire of available antiviral treatment options are of crucial

61

importance to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

62

Since the beginning of the 21st century, the world has encountered multiple epidemics that

63

were caused by a viral or bacterial agent, like the Ebola-, Measles-, Zika-viruses and cholera [14].

64

Some epidemics even reached pandemic proportions, like the Influenza A/H1N1 virus and the

65

currently circulating SARS-CoV-2. As a rapid response to these virulent agents, the Medicines for

66

Malaria Venture (MMV, mmv.org) and Drugs for Neglected Diseases intitiative (DNDi, dndi.org)

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.17.100404; this version posted May 17, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

67

developed the pandemic response box (PRB), a compound library containing 400 compounds with

68

antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties. This compound library contains drugs that are already

69

marketed or are at various stages of development and analysis and allows for the rapid investigation

70

of repurposing drugs against newly emerging pathogens.

71

To this end, we performed an in vitro-based screen of 400 preselected compounds with

72

antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties contained in the PRB and assessed their antiviral

73

activity against SARS-CoV-2. A stringent large-scale screen in Vero-E6 cells highlighted sixteen

74

compounds that prevented virus-induced cytopathogenic effects (CPE) while displaying low

75

cytotoxicity and no effect on cell viability. Further evaluation revealed that five compounds had an

76

equal or higher antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, compared to the nucleoside analogue

77

Remdesivir. Together, these data demonstrate that stringent in vitro screening of preselected

78

compounds leads to the rapid identification of potent antiviral candidate drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2.

Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium-GlutaMAX, 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100

84

mg/ml streptomycin, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 1% (w/v) non-essential amino acids and 15 mM HEPES

85

(Gibco). Cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-

86

CoV-2/München-1.1/2020/929 [15], stocks were produced on Vero-E6 cells, aliquoted and stored at -

87

80°C. Viral titers were determined by tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) on Vero-E6 cells.

Compound preparation of the pandemic response box.

89

All compounds were dissolved and diluted in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma) to 1 mM aliquots in

90

96-well plates (TPP) that were kept at -20°C until further use. Compounds were diluted at the

91

in the PRB. Remdesivir [8], K22 [12] and DMSO controls were included in each plate. Subsequently,

96

cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 in compound-

97

containing medium and incubated at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Uninfected (mock)

98

controls were included in each plate. At 48 hours post-infection (hpi), cells were visually inspected for

99

virus-induced CPE prior to fixation with 4% (v/v) neutral buffered formalin (Formafix AG) and stained

100

with crystal violet. Cell viability and cytotoxicity were assessed in parallel, in identically treated,

101

uninfected plates. Two independent experiments were performed, each including a technical

102

duplicate. Wells containing an intact cell layer without apparent CPE after infection and displaying high

111

compounds, ranging from 4 µM to 0.063 µM. Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI of 0.01) in

112

compound-containing medium and incubated at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Cells

113

were fixed with 4% (v/v) neutral buffered formalin at 24 hours post-infection and processed for

114

immunofluorescence analysis. Briefly, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Merck)

115

for 5 minutes and blocked in PBS supplemented with 50 mM NH4Cl, 0.1% (w/v) Saponin (Sigma) and

116

2% (w/v) Bovine serum albumine (IgG-free, Jackson immunoresearch). SARS-CoV-2 antigen-positive

117

cells were detected using a rabbit polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (Rockland, 200-

118

401-A50) and a secondary Alexa Fluor® 488-labeled donkey anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (Jackson

Results

132

Survival screen with compounds included in the pandemic response box against SARS-CoV-2.

133

To identify potential compounds that can be used as intervention option against SARS-CoV-2

134

replication, we screened 201 antibacterial, 46 antifungal and 153 antiviral molecules included in the

135

PRB for their antiviral activity. We initially screened the 400 compounds at a conservative

136

concentration of 1 µM. Based on the documented inhibition of coronavirus replication, Remdesivir and

137

K22 were included as a positive control [8,12]. Vero-E6 cells were pretreated for 2 hours and

138

subsequently infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI of 0.01) for 48 hours in drug-containing medium. Cell

139

survival was arbitrarily scored, from 0 to 2, upon visual inspection and evaluation of SARS-CoV-2-

140

induced CPE (Supp. Fig. 1a). This screen resulted in a total of five compounds that completely

141

inhibited SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE (white), while twelve other compounds showed an intermediate

142

CPE reduction (Grey). In parallel, we performed cell viability and cell cytotoxicity assays to exclude

143

any detrimental effect of each compound on the cells. Only for one compound (Plate B, D10) we

144

observed low cell viability and high cytotoxicity. The sixteen remaining compounds are antifungal

145

(three), antibacterial (six) and antiviral (seven) compounds (Table 1), which, similarly to their vehicle

146

control (DMSO), Remdesivir and K22, did not influence cell cytotoxicity and cell viability (Supp. Fig.

147

1b, c). These results provide evidence for the relevance of a conservative and rapid screening of

148

libraries containing compounds that target viral replication.

149
150

Antiviral efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.

151

To further confirm and evaluate the extent of antiviral activity of the previously highlighted sixteen

152

compounds, cells were pretreated with the selected compounds at dosages ranging from 4 µM to

153

0.063 µM and infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI of 0.01). After 24 hours of infection, cells were fixed

154

and processed for immunofluorescence analysis using the anti-SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein

155

antibody and DAPI. The efficacy of the selected compounds to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, as well as their

156

individual effects of cell viability and cytotoxicity, were compared to Remdesivir. The IC50 values for

157

each compound were inferred by calculating the ratio of the total intensity of the nucleocapsid protein

158

and DAPI signals (infected cells / total cells). This indicated that five of sixteen selected candidate

159

compounds, N-Nonyldeoxynojirimycin (NN-DNJ), PDNJ0803, Chloroquine, Retro-2.1 and URMC-099-

160

C, inhibited the virus at least as potently as the reference compound Remdesivir (Figure 1).

made available under aCC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license.

161

Moreover, these five compounds showed equal or lower IC50 values against SARS-CoV-2 replication

162

than the reference compound Remdesivir (IC50 = 1.842), without increased cytotoxicity or decreased

163

cell viability compared to the vehicle control on the analyzed concentrations (Fig. 2 A-G, Table 2). The

164

remaining eleven compounds showed little or no inhibition when compared to the reference

165

compound, and therefore no reliable IC50 could be calculated (Supp. Fig 2).

166

In parallel to the efficacy, we determined the half-maximum cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) of

167

each respective compound at a concentration range from 0.04 µM to 50 µM using uninfected Vero-E6

168

cells. This demonstrated that the previously tested compounds were all well tolerated at 2 or 4-fold

169

higher concentrations than the initial screening concentration of 1 μM (Figure 2H, table 2). At

170

concentrations up to 50 µM, only URMC-099-C displayed moderate cell cytotoxicity, resulting in a

171

CC50 of 13.1 µM, while all other compounds had a CC50 above 50 µM (Table 2). Further, the resulting

172

selectivity indexes (SI) showed that Retro-2.1 (SI = 101.9) is the most effective and less cytotoxic

173

inhibitor, followed by chloroquine (SI = 48.5), URMC-099-C (SI = 39.1), whereas NN-DNJ (SI = 29.82),

174

and PDNJ0803 (SI = 24.68) had comparable SI to that of Remdesivir (SI = 27.14) (Table 2).

175

Combined these results demonstrate that Retro-2.1 is the most potent antiviral candidate that should

176

be further evaluated on its mode of action, efficacy and safety in pre-clinical models such as human

177

airway epithelial cultures, as well as appropriate in vivo models for SARS-CoV-2.

Discussion

179

In this study we demonstrate that a conservative in vitro screening approach of 400

180

compounds from the PRB resulted in the identification of five compounds with potent antiviral activity

181

against SARS-CoV-2. This included the anti-malaria drug chloroquine and antibacterial Retro-2.1, as

182

well as antiviral compounds NN-DNJ, PDNJ0803, and URMC-099-C. Antiviral efficacy testing revealed

183

that Chloroquine, NN-DNJ, PDNJ0803, and URMC-099-C, all have a comparable characteristics to

184

that of the reference compound Remdesivir, while the antimicrobial compound Retro-2.1 displayed

185

almost a 4-fold higher selectivity index profile over that of Remdesivir in Vero-E6 cells. These results

186

indicate that conservative in vitro screening approaches of preselected compounds can lead to the

187

rapid identification of potent antiviral candidates targeting SARS-CoV-2. We and others have

188

previously screened different compound libraries against a variety of coronaviruses in a range of 10 to

189

50 µM that identified several compounds with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

190

[12,17,18]. However, in the current study we employed a stringent survival screening approach to

191

expedite the identification of candidate compounds effective against SARS-CoV-2. This comes with

192

the expense that compounds effective at higher molar concentrations are missed.

193

We used the nucleoside analogue Remdesivir as a reference compound against SARS-CoV-2

194

and observed an IC50 of 1.842 µM and a CC50 of >50 µM on Vero-E6 cells, in agreement with previous

195

studies describing the inhibitory effect of Remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 [8]. In line with this, we also

196

identified Chloroquine as a potent antiviral compound against SARS-CoV-2, which has also been

197

shown to effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [8]. In contrast, K22 neither inhibited SARS-CoV nor

198

SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1) replication at low concentrations [12]. This exemplifies the robust

199

reproducibility of the antiviral screen presented here and its consistency with previously published

200

reports. Further, it establishes Remdesivir and chloroquine as reliable reference compounds during

201

antiviral efficacy assessments of novel compounds against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.

202

The five candidate compounds identified here, namely chloroquine, NN-DNJ, PDNJ0803,

203

URMC-099-C, and Retro-2.1 have previously also been demonstrated to inhibit the replication of other

204

RNA-viruses such as Filoviruses, Flaviviruses and Picornaviruses [19–21]. Although we did not

205

evaluate the mode of action of the identified compounds, it has been described that Chloroquine

206

interferes with the endosomal viral entry and release pathways of coronaviruses, including SARS-

207

CoV-2, whereas the immunomodulatory compound URMC-099-C might influence important Mitogen-

208

activated protein kinases (MAPK) associated biological processes [8,22,23]. Interestingly, Retro-2.1

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.17.100404; this version posted May 17, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

209

remodels the intracellular distribution of syntaxins, which consequently alters vesicular retrograde

210

transport between endosomes and the Golgi apparatus [24,25]. Of note, we previous identified several

211

syntaxins (stxbp1, stxbp3, stx5a, and stx18) in close proximity of the replication and transcription

212

complexes during coronavirus replication [26]. Since coronaviruses strongly rely on cellular

213

endomembranes and trafficking pathways for efficient replication, Retro-2.1 might directly target the

214

Achilles heel of coronavirus replication. Further, NN-DNJ and its derivate PBDNJ0803 are categorized

215

into the same class of inhibitors that target the cellular α-glucosidase I and II, which support the

216

maturation, secretion and function of viral glycoproteins [27]. NN-DNJ and PBDNJ0803 interfere with

217

the interactions between glycoproteins and the ER-chaperones Calnexin and Calreticulin, thereby

218

disturbing the removal of terminal glucose residues from the n-glycans of glycoproteins [28].

219

Moreover, NN-DNJ has been described to effectively inhibit the replication of a wide range of RNA

220

viruses such as Hepatitis C virus and Flaviviruses, as well as SARS-CoV [27–29]. Lastly, URMC-099-

221

C has mainly been described as a suppressor of the inflammatory response and has been suggested

222

for antiretroviral therapy [30]. Investigations deciphering its effect during the viral life cycle are limited,

223

however, it is involved in the MAPK-pathway and is a positive regulator of the c-jun N-terminal kinase

224

signaling pathway [23]. In summary, further evaluation on the mode of action and in vivo efficacy of

225

each compound against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses is warranted to establish whether

226

conserved host or viral features can be efficiently targeted by the selected antiviral compounds.

227

In summary, the stringent in vitro screening of 400 compounds identified several candidate

228

compounds possessing potent antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 that vindicate further efficacy

229

and safety testing in pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo models as novel intervention strategies against

230

SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.

257

the five hits after 24 hours of incubation on Vero-E6 cells at 37°C with a 5% CO2-humidity. The cells

258

were pretreated for 2 hours with the compound dilution prior to infection. To determine the inhibition of

259

the five compounds, the measured total fluorescence signal intensity of GFP (infected cells) per well

260

was divided by the total fluorescence signal intensity of DAPI (presence of cells) per well, indicated as

261

the GFP/DAPI ratio. The GFP/DAPI ratio of each compound dilution of Retro-2.1 (C), Chloroquine (D),

262

n-Nonyldeoxynojirimycin (NN-DNJ) (E), PBDNJ0803 (F) and URMC-099 (G) are compared to

263

Remdesivir, K22 and DMSO. Results are displayed as means and SD of three individual experiments.

264

To control for cytotoxicity, the half maximum cytotoxicity concentration 50% (CC50) per compound

265

were determined (H). Results of the CC50 are shown as means and SD from two individual

266

experiments.
