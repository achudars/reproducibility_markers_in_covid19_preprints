ABSTRACT
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus that is presumed to have emerged
from bats to crossover into humans in late 2019. As the global
pandemic ensues, scientist are working to evaluate the virus and
develop a vaccine to counteract the deadly disease that has impacted lives across the entire globe. We perform computational
electrostatic simulations on multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein s1 in complex with human angiotensin-converting enzyme
2 (ACE2) variants to examine differences in electrostatic interactions across the various complexes. Calculations are performed
across the physiological pH range to also examine the impact of
pH on these interactions. Two of six spike protein s1 variations
having greater electric forces at pH levels consistent with nasal
secretions and significant variations in force across all five variants
of ACE2. Five out of six spike protein s1 variations have relatively
consistent forces at pH levels of the lung, and one spike protein
s1 variant that has low potential across a wide range of pH. These
predictions indicate that variants of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and
human ACE2 in certain combinations could potentially play a role
in increased binding efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.

1 INTRODUCTION
SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) is the latest novel coronavirus to have crossed
the species boundary into humans over the past twenty years [7, 22].
Currently available information strongly suggests an originating
source of the CoV-2 virus to be the bat coronavirus SL-CoV-RaTG13
with 96% similarity to CoV-2 [21].
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared CoV-2 a public
health emergency on January 30, 2020 and then pandemic status in
the weeks following. WHO utilizes a tool to distinguish diseases
based on the potential to bloom into epidemic/pandemic proportions and the availability of countermeasures to focus research and
development (R&D) resources accordingly [19, 20].
We have previously performed extensive research using electrostatic analysis of HIV gp120 envelope glycoprotein interactions with
human CD4 and broadly neutralizing antibody proteins [5, 6, 11‚Äì
13, 15]. Electrostatics are a novel way to evaluate protein interactions at the structural level with a focus on how environmental
conditions, like pH, effect binding efficacy. The processes can easily

be adapted to any other protein-protein interactions which may
be strengthened or weakened by modulating pH. The theoretical
approaches have been further extended to predict electric force
(Coulombs Law) modulation by pH using the same set of data generated by the electrostatic surface charge (ESSC) pipeline [10, 15].

2 RESULTS
For this research we utilized CoV-2 spike (s1) proteins: 6LZG_B,
6M17_E, 6VW1_2, 6W41_C, QIS30425.1, QIS60489.1 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) proteins: AAQ89076.1, BAG37592.1,
BAJ21180.1, EAW98891.1, XP_011543854.1 obtained through sequence similarity searches using NCBI Protein BLAST and the
Protein Data Bank [2]. Structurally, CoV-2 s1 shares similar traits
with SARS-CoV s1 that emerged in 2003 with a major point of difference being an additional cleavage in the spike s1 protein sub-unit
[17] making the substitution of similar SARS-CoV species difficult
to justify in modeling and simulation work.
Computational methods of the pipeline performed as expected
on s1 (see methods), but some results differed in content greatly
when compared to those of HIV gp120. Past investigations predict
stronger binding affinity between HIV gp120 and human CD4 proteins at lower physiological pH compared to higher physiological
pH. Evidence of this was demonstrated by the pipeline EFP and
BE data from those protein and complexes [5, 6, 11, 13]. However,
the EFP and BE data for s1-ACE2 interactions predict no notable
differences in binding efficacy across the physiologically relevant
pH range. These data suggest that the s1-ACE2 interaction is therefore not pH-sensitive. For example, in Figure 1 we present a typical
EFP for s1 and observe no notable shifts (away form zero) for these
data in the physiologically relevant pH range. Color bars indicate
the pH range of normal nasal secretions (red), pH 5.5 to 6.5; yellow
indicates inflamed nasal secretions (rhinitis) from pH 7.2 to 8.3
[4]. Blue indicates the approximate lung pH listed as 7.38 to 7.43
[3], however, the graphs scale in 0.1 increments and displays the
range as pH 7.3 to 7.5 as inclusive of the specific range. In Figure
2 we present the BEs for complexes showing the least and most
variation, again observing no notable shifts for these data in the
same relevant pH range.
One possible explanation for this lack of pH sensitivity is the
minimal conformational change exhibited by s1-ACE2 interactions
compared to gp120-CD4 interactions. The gp120-CD4 interaction
requires a relatively large conformational change of the gp120 protein, leading to changes in the protein surface (residues) exposed
to the external environment. In particular, an increase in negative
surface change in the bound conformation (relative to the unbound
conformation) of gp120, is thought to make the bound conformation

energetically more favorable at low pH. However, the conformational change observed in s1-ACE2 complex binding appears to be
either too small to alter, or simply results in too little alteration in
the electrostatic surface charge of s1.
EFP and BE results predict that no or minimal differences exist
in binding efficacy across the physiological pH range for s1-ACE2
interactions. These predictions leave unanswered questions, for
instance, does the lack of differences in binding efficacy across the
physiological pH range mean that s1 binds consistently regardless
of pH? Another question, more pertinent to this research, what
measurable forces are present between s1 and ACE2 that drive an
interaction to taker place?
As a solution to the latter question, we expand the analysis with
an alternative approach to electrostatic fingerprinting by taking the
absolute values of the difference between s1 and ACE2 unbound
conformation ESSC pipeline data to expose a predicted electric
potential difference. We present results containing the highest and
lowest potential differences from pH 4.5 to 9.0 in Figure 3. These
data show an electric potential difference which varies across the examined pH range exists of varying quantity and across all complex
combinations evaluated. Furthermore, the pipeline data predicts
that s1 is positively charged throughout the pH range while ACE2
has a transition to negative between pH 4.5 and 5.0 as show in
Figure 4. The presence of electric potential differences allow the
results to be interpreted in terms of electric force.
The presence of electric potential difference introduces a force
that can be determined by applying Coulombs Law to obtain the
Electric Force (ùêπùëí ) in Newtons (ùëÅ ). We can graph the changing
forces, either repulsive (+) or attractive (-) between s1 and ACE2,
across pH range of 3.0 to 9.0 in 0.1 increments at a distance of
10√Ö. Our model is non-specific in that specific interactions involve
close-proximity contacts between proteins such as hydrogen bonds,

unlike charges, and hydrophobic residue stacking. However, nonspecific interactions are not close-proximity, and can be attractive
or repulsive beyond the range of 3 angstroms or more. Electric force
is a good example of the latter case. Details of the calculation are
provided in the Methods section below.
Figure 5 displays the electric force from pH 3.0 to 9.0 in 0.1
increments for all complexes. Positive values indicate a repulsive
force and negative values indicate an attractive force. For Figure 6
we discard the repulsive forces for the sake of figure clarity and on
the basis that they exist outside the relevant pH range.
In Figure 6 we can see unique characteristics emerging where a
group of complexes stand out from the rest with weakly attractive
forces in a smooth curve across the examined range; another cluster
of complexes emerges with a higher level of force in a slightly more
erratic curve across the range and a group of complexes with a
pronounced peak in force across the range of nasal secretions that
peaks in the approximate middle.
While more details can be obtained from Figure 6, a clearer
understanding is provided by Figure 7, which is grouped by s1.
Clear patterns emerge that indicate higher forces presents for s1

3 DISCUSSION
Our results clearly predict that sequence variations of s1 and ACE2
directly impact the attractive forces involved between s1 and ACE2.
Furthermore, these results implicate human ACE2 variations that
exacerbate those forces for specific s1 and ACE2 combinations.
Additionally, we point out that three groupings emerge in this
analysis showing two s1 variants (6LZG_B and 6W41_C) with large
spikes in attractive force at pH 5.5 to 6.5 associated with nasal
secretions. Three s1 variants (6M17_E, QIS30425.1, and QIS60489.1)
have a relatively smooth curve at nominal attractive forces across
ACE2 variants and one s1 variation (6VW1_2) has a smooth curve
with low attractive force and minimal differences across ACE2
variations.

a broad interpretation of the data where a single group of

Not all s1 and ACE2 protein sequences examined have solved
crystal structures and were instead modeled based on the currently
available s1 and ACE2 structures (see methods). Additional crystal
structures for either or both s1 and ACE2 would allow for more
precise predictions. Additionally, an analysis of electric force at
the amino acid level would provide more detailed predictions at
specific regions involved with s1 and ACE2 contact points and will
be the subject of future studies.

4 METHODS
All computational methods related to the electrostatic pipeline
are detailed in [5, 6, 11‚Äì13, 15]. Templates used to model s1 are:
6LZG, 6M0J, 6VW1, and 6VYB [9, 14, 17, 18] and for ACE2 the
templates are: 1R4L, 1R42, 6M0J, 6VW1 [9, 14, 16]. To target Frodan
for specific conformations of s1 we used: 6LGZ as bound and 6VYB
as unbound target conformations. For ACE2 we used 6LZG for
bound and unbound target conformations.
For the specific calculation of Electric Force, APBS returns a
factor for ùëâ in:

ùëò ùëá
ùëâ = ùëè
ùëíùëê
Where ùëâ is voltage of the system per unit, ùëòùëè is the Boltzmann‚Äôs

ùëíùëê is the charge of an electron: 1.60217646 E-19 C.
