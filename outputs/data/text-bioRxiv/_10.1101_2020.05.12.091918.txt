ABSTRACT

22

Multiple vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 based on viral spike protein are under

23

development. However, there is limited information on the quality of antibody response generated

24

following vaccination by these vaccine modalities. To better understand antibody response

25

induced by spike protein-based vaccines, we immunized rabbits with various SARS-CoV-2 spike

26

protein antigens: S-ectodomain (S1+S2) (aa 16-1213), which lacks the cytoplasmic and

27

transmembrane domains (CT-TM), the S1 domain (aa 16-685), the receptor-binding domain

28

(RBD) (aa 319-541), and the S2 domain (aa 686-1213 as control). Antibody response was analyzed

29

by ELISA, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) against different Spike proteins in native

30

conformation, and a pseudovirion neutralization assay to measure the quality and function of the

31

antibodies elicited by the different Spike antigens. All three antigens (S1+S2 ectodomain, S1

32

domain, and RBD) generated strong neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination

33

induced antibody repertoire was analyzed by SARS-CoV-2 spike Genome Fragment Phage

34

Display Libraries (SARS-CoV-2 GFPDL), which identified immunodominant epitopes in the S1,

35

S1-RBD and S2 domains. Furthermore, these analyses demonstrated that surprisingly the RBD

36

immunogen elicited a higher antibody titer with 5-fold higher affinity antibodies to native spike

37

antigens compared with other spike antigens. These findings may help guide rational vaccine

38

design and facilitate development and evaluation of effective therapeutics and vaccines against

39

COVID-19 disease.

INTRODUCTION

42

The ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in more than 2 million human cases

43

and 125,000 deaths as of 15th April 2020. Therefore, development of effective vaccines for

44

prevention and medical countermeasures for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection is a high global

45

priority. The spike glycoprotein has been identified as the key target for protective antibodies

46

against both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2(1-4). Consequently, multiple versions of the SARS-

47

CoV-2 spike proteins are currently under evaluation as vaccine candidates utilizing different

48

modalities and delivery systems(5). However, only limited knowledge exists on antibody

49

repertoire or quality of the immune response generated following vaccination by different spike

50

vaccine antigens. Therefore, it is important to perform comprehensive evaluation of post-

51

vaccination antibody response to elucidate the quality of the immune responses elicited by spike-

52

based vaccine candidates to determine immune markers that may predict clinical benefit which

53

can facilitate evaluation of vaccine candidates.

54

To better understand vaccination-induced antibody response, we immunized rabbits with

55

several SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins: the S-ectodomain (S1+S2) (aa 16-1213) lacking the

56

cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains (delta CT-TM), the S1 domain (aa 16-685), the receptor-

57

binding domain (RBD) (aa 319-541), and the S2 domain (aa 686-1213), as a control. Post-

58

vaccination sera were analyzed by Genome Fragment Phage Display Libraries covering the entire

59

spike gene (SARS-CoV-2 GFPDL) to determine the polyclonal antibody epitope repertoire

60

generated following vaccination as previously applied for other diseases(6-10). In addition, we

61

employed several antibody binding assays (ELISA, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) based real-

62

time kinetics assay) (10-12) and an in vitro SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirion neutralization assay to

63

measure the quality and function of the antibodies elicited by the different SARS-CoV-2 spike

3

64

antigens. This study could inform development and evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and

65

therapeutics based on the spike glycoprotein.

67

RESULTS:

68

Rabbit immunization with SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigens

69

Most spike-based vaccines currently under development are designed to contain the

70

receptor-binding domain (RBD; aa 319-541) in some form. Therefore, we evaluated four different

71

commercially available SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and subdomains: the Spike S1+S2 ectodomain

72

(aa 16-1213), the S1 domain (aa 16-685), RBD domain (aa 319-541), and the S2 domain (aa 686-

73

1213) as a control, which is devoid of RBD (Fig. 1A, Suppl. Fig. 1). Theese spike proteins were

74

either produced in HEK 293 mammalian cells (S1 and RBD) or insect cells (S1+S2 ectodomain

75

and S2 domain). The purified S1+S2 ectodomain, the S1 domain, and the RBD proteins retained

76

the functional activity as demonstrated in SPR assay using human ACE2 protein, the SARS-CoV-

77

2 receptor (Fig. 1B). The S1+S2 ectodomain, S1 domain and RBD (black, blue and red binding

78

curves, respectively) demonstrated high-affinity interaction with human ACE2. The control S2

79

domain protein (green curve), lacking the RBD, did not bind to human ACE2, demonstrating

80

specificity of this receptor-binding assay (Fig.1B).

81

Female New Zealand white rabbits were immunized twice intra-muscularly at a 14-day

82

interval with 50 g of the purified proteins mixed with Emulsigen Adjuvant. Sera were collected

83

before (pre-vaccination) and after the first and second vaccination and analyzed for binding

84

antibodies in ELISA and SPR, in a pseudovirion neutralization assay, and by GFPDL analysis.

86

Antibody Response following immunization with different Spike antigens

87

Serial dilutions of post-second vaccination rabbit sera were evaluated for binding of serum

88

IgG to various spike proteins and domains in ELISA (S1+S2; black, S1; blue, RBD; red, and S2;

89

green) (Fig. 1C). Representative titration curves to spike ectodomain (S1+S2) and to the RBD in

90

IgG-ELISA are shown in Suppl. Fig. 2. End-point titers of the serum IgG were determined as the

91

reciprocal of the highest dilution providing an optical density (OD) twice that of the negative

92

control (Fig. 1C). All four immunogens elicited strong IgG binding to the spike ectodomain

93

(S1+S2). Binding to the individual domains (S1, S2, and RBD) was specific, in that sera generated

94

by S2 vaccination bound to S2, but not to S1 or RBD, and vice-versa (Fig. 1C).

95

SPR allows following antibody binding to captured antigens in real-time kinetics, including

96

total antibody binding in resonance units (Max RU) and affinity kinetics (Suppl. Fig. 3). In ELISA,

97

the antigens directly coated in the wells can be partially denatured increasing the likelihood of

98

presenting epitopes that are not seen on the native form of the protein by the polyclonal serum IgG.

99

On the other hand, in our SPR, the purified recombinant spike proteins were captured to a Ni-NTA

100

sensor chip to maintain the native conformation (as determined by ACE2 binding) to allow

101

comparisons of binding to and dissociation from the four proteins. Importantly, the protein density

102

captured on the chip surface is low (200 RU) and was optimized to measure primarily monovalent

103

interactions, so as to measure the average affinity of antibody binding in the polyclonal serum (8,

104

13). Additionally, while ELISA measured only IgG binding, in SPR, all antibody isotypes

105

contributed to antibody binding to the captured spike antigen. In the current study, all rabbit sera

106

contained anti spike antibodies that were at least 86% IgG (data not shown). Serial dilutions of

107

post-vaccination serum were analyzed for binding kinetics with different spike proteins (Suppl.

108

Fig. 3). The spike ectodomain (S1+S2) generated antibodies that predominantly bound to S1+S2
5

109

(black bar), followed by the S1 protein (blue bar), and 3-fold lower antibody binding to the RBD

110

and the S2 domain (red and green bars, respectively) (Fig. 1D). The S1 domain antigen induced

111

antibodies that bound with similar titers (Max RU values) to the S1+S2, S1 and RBD proteins

112

(black, blue and red bars, respectively), and did not show reactivity to the S2 domain (green bar).

113

However, the antibody reactivity of rabbit anti-S1 serum to S1+S2 domain was 3-fold lower than

114

the antibodies in the rabbit anti-S1+S2 serum. RBD immunization generated similar high-titer

115

antibody binding to S1+S2, S1 and RBD (black, blue and red bars, respectively), (Fig. 1D). In

116

contrast, the S2 domain induced antibodies that primarily bound to homologous S2 antigen (green

117

bars) and only weakly binding to the S1+S2 ectodomain (black bars), and no binding to either S1

118

or RBD (Fig. 1D).

119

Antibody off-rate constants, which describe the fraction of antigen–antibody complexes

120

that decay per second, were determined directly from the serum sample interaction with SARS-

121

CoV-2 spike ectodomain (S1+S2), S1, S2, and RBD using SPR in the dissociation phase only for

122

sensorgrams with Max RU in the range of 20–100 RU (Suppl. Fig. 3) and calculated using the

123

BioRad ProteOn manager software for the heterogeneous sample model as described before(11).

124

These off rates provide additional important information on the affinity of the antibodies following

125

vaccination with the different spike proteins that are likely to have an impact on the antibody

126

function in vivo, as was observed previously in studies with influenza virus, RSV and Ebola virus

127

(13-15). Surprisingly, we observed significant differences in the affinities of antibodies elicited by

128

the four spike antigens (Fig. 1E). Specifically, the RBD induced 5-fold higher affinity antibodies

129

(slower dissociation rates) against S1+S2 (black), S1 (blue) and RBD (red) proteins, compared

130

with the post-vaccination antibodies generated by other three immunogens (Fig. 1E).

6

131

SARS-CoV-2 neutralization was measured using SARS-CoV-2-FBLuc in a single-cycle

132

PsVN assay in Vero E6 cells. The average percent inhibition by post-first and post-second rabbit

133

vaccination are shown in Fig. 1F. Pre-vaccination rabbit sera (Control Rb) did not neutralize

134

SARS-CoV-2 in PsVN assay. Sera generated by S1+S2-ectodomain, S1 and RBD (1:40 dilution)

135

(but not anti-S2) showed 50-60% virus neutralization after a single vaccination, and 93-98% virus

136

inhibition by the post-second vaccination sera (Fig. 1F).

137
138

Epitope repertoires recognized by antibodies generated against SARS-CoV-2 spike antigens

139

The constructed SARS-CoV-2 GFPDL contains sequences ranging from 50-1500 bp long

140

from the spike gene (GenBank #MN908947) with >107.2 unique phage clones. The SARS-CoV-2-

141

GFPDL displayed linear and conformational epitopes with random distribution of size and

142

sequence of inserts that spanned the entire spike gene. SARS-CoV-2 GFPDL panning with

143

individual post-second vaccination rabbit sera were conducted as described in Methods. The

144

numbers of IgG-bound SARS-CoV-2 GFPDL phage clones with different serum sample ranged

145

between 2.6 x 104 to 9.8 x 105/mL (Fig. 2A). Graphical distribution of representative clones with

146

a frequency of >2, obtained after affinity selection, and their alignment to the spike protein of

147

SARS-CoV-2 are shown for the four vaccine groups (Fig. 2 B-E). The spike (S1+S2) ectodomain

148

induced diverse antibody response that included strong binding to epitopes in the C-terminal region

149

of the soluble protein spanning the HR2 region (i.e., multiple phage clones with similar inserts).

150

This region may not be highly exposed on the virions or infected cells but is clearly immunogenic

151

in the soluble recombinant spike ectodomain. In addition, the rabbit anti-S1+S2 antibodies bound

152

diverse epitopes spanning the RBD and to a lesser degree to the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the

153

C-terminal region of S1, and the N-terminus of S2, including the fusion peptide (Fig. 2B and Suppl.
7

154

Table 1). The S1 domain elicited very strong response against the C-terminal region of S1 protein

155

and a diverse antibody repertoire recognizing the NTD and RBD/RBM regions (Fig. 2C and Suppl.

156

Table 1). The recombinant RBD induced high-titer antibodies that were highly focused to the

157

RBD/RBM (Fig. 2E, and Suppl. Table 1). In contrast, the recombinant S2 immunogen after two

158

immunizations in rabbits elicited antibodies primarily targeting the C-terminus of the S2 protein

159

(CD-HR2).

160

All the immunodominant antigenic sites identified by the SARS-CoV-2 GFPDL panning

161

of all 4 immune sera on the spike sequence are shown in Suppl. Fig. 4. Alignment of the sequence

162

with other coronaviruses shows that some of the antigenic sites are >70% conserved among several

163

coronavirus strains isolated from humans and bats, especially those located in the S2 domain

164

(Suppl. Table 1). Structural depiction of these antigenic sites on the SARS-CoV-2 spike (Suppl.

165

Fig. 5; in blue on PDB#6VSB), demonstrated that most of these antigenic sites identified in the

166

current study are surface exposed on the native prefusion spike(2).

167
168

DISCUSSION

169

In this study, we performed an in-depth evaluation of antibody response generated by

170

various SARS-CoV-2 spike antigens that are similar to the vaccine antigens being used in clinical

171

development(5, 16, 17). Bioinformatics approach previously identified 279 potential B-cell

172

epitopes and 48 potential T cell epitopes in the Spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV viruses, based

173

on human antibody responses to the SARS-CoV-1 infection and the corresponding epitopes in

174

SARS-CoV-2 spike (Grifoni et al. Table 4) (18). We compared the predominant antigenic sites

175

identified by antibodies in our study generated by different spike antigens with the B cell epitopes

176

predicted by Grifoni et al.(18). Four of the predicted B epitopes overlapped with the sequences we
8

177

identified in our GFPDL analysis: aa 287-317 in NTD-RBD overlaps with our antigenic site aa

178

298-363 which is 77% homologous between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2; aa 524-598 and aa

179

601-640, in the C-terminus of S1 overlap with our antigenic site containing aa 548-632 (78.8 %

180

conservation between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2); aa 802-819 in the S2 domain/FP overlaps

181

with our antigenic site aa 768-828 (83% conserved between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2) (Fig.

182

S4 and Suppl. Table 1). The other epitopes identified in our study cover less conserved sequences

183

between the two SARS-CoV viruses that are unique to the SARS-CoV-2 spike and were not

184

identified in the in-silico approach by Grifoni et al.

185

Surprisingly, the S2 domain doesn’t appear to elicit as many neutralizing antibodies as

186

RBD or S1. Although S2 contains the fusion peptide, it does not appear to be as immunogenic,

187

compared with S1 or RBD, in generating binding antibodies to the intact spike (S1+S2)

188

ectodomain, as observed in both IgG ELISA and SPR. Even though we characterized the purified

189

proteins in various assays, there is a possibility that the structure of the antigens used in the study

190

is different from the corresponding authentic spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 virion

191

particle.

192

One unexpected finding in this study was the higher affinity of antibodies elicited by the

193

RBD compared with the other spike antigens (S1+S2 ectodomain, S1 and S2 domains). In earlier

194

studies, with vaccines against H7N9 avian influenza we found important correlation between

195

antibody affinity against the hemagglutinin HA1 globular domain and control of virus loads after

196

challenge of ferrets with H7N9 (19). In study of patients recovering from Zika virus (ZIKV)

197

infections, their antibody affinity against ZIKV E-DIII correlated with lower clinical scores(20).

198

In a large randomised clinical trial of IVIG hyper-enriched for influenza virus antibodies (hIVIG),

199

in adults hospitalised with confirmed influenza A or B infections, a statistically significant
9

200

virological benefit and clinical benefit for patients infected with B strains, directly correlated with

201

stronger antibody affinities of the hIVIG for circulating B strains (14). In a recent longitudinal

202

study of Ebola virus disease survivor, affinity maturation to Ebola virus GP was associated with a

203

rapid decline in viral replication and illness severity in this patient (13). Thus, vaccines that can

204

elicit high affinity antibodies may have a significant advantage for in-vivo clinical outcome of

205

SARS-CoV-2 infection and contribute to amelioration of disease in infected individuals.

206

Therefore, in addition to measurements of antibody-binding titers and virus neutralization, this and

207

the previous studies demonstrate the importance of assessments of antibody affinity maturation

208

during SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials.

209

In summary, our study highlights the need to perform comprehensive analysis of immune

210

response generated following vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection to identify biomarkers of

211

protective immunity. In-depth understanding of quantitative and qualitative aspects of immune

212

responses generated by different spike protein vaccine antigens could aid the development and

213

evaluation of effective SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics and vaccines.

METHODS:

300
301

Recombinant CoV Proteins

302

Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins were purchased from Sino Biologicals (S1+S2

303

ectodomain; 40589-V08B1, S1; 40591-V08H, RBD; 40592-V08H or S2; 40590-V08B).

304

Recombinant purified proteins used in the study were either produced in HEK 293 mammalian

305

cells (S1 and RBD) or insect cells (S1+S2 ectodomain and S2 domain).

306
307

Rabbit immunization Studies

308

Female New Zealand white rabbits (Charles River labs) were immunized twice intra-

309

muscularly at 14-days interval with 50 g of purified proteins mixed with Emulsigen Adjuvant.

310

Sera were collected before (pre-vaccination) and after 1st and 2nd vaccination and analyzed for

311

binding antibodies in ELISA, SPR, neutralization assay and GFPDL analysis.

312

313

ELISA

314

96 well Immulon plates were coated with 100 ng/100 µL of recombinant spike protein and

315

protein domains in PBS overnight at 4oC. Starting at a 1:100 dilution, serum samples were serially

316

diluted 1:5 and applied to the protein-coated plate in 10 µL for 1 hr at ambient temperature. Serum

317

samples were assayed in duplicate. Naïve serum samples were assayed along with the experimental

318

samples. After three washes with PBS/0.05% Tween 20, bound antibodies were detected with a

319

donkey anti-rabbit IgG Fc-specific HRP-conjugated antibody (Jackson Immuno Research) After
15

320

1hr, plates were washed as before and OPD was added for 10min. Absorbance was measured at

321

492 nm. End titer was determined as 2-fold above the average of the absorbance values of the

322

naïve serum samples. The end titer is reported as the last serum dilution that was above this cutoff.

323
324

Antibody binding kinetics of post-vaccination sera to recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins by

325

Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)

326

Steady-state equilibrium binding of post-vaccination rabbit polyclonal serum was

327

monitored at 25°C using a ProteOn surface plasmon resonance (BioRad). The purified

328

recombinant Spike proteins were captured to a Ni-NTA sensor chip with 200 resonance units (RU)

329

in the test flow channels. The native functional activity of the Spike proteins was determined by

330

binding to the 5 µg/mL human ACE2 protein.

331

For serum analysis, the protein density on the chip was optimized such as to measure

332

monovalent interactions independent of the antibody isotype. Serially diluted (10-, 20-, 40-, 80-,

333

and 160-fold of freshly prepared sera were injected at a flow rate of 50 µl/min (120 sec contact

334

duration) for association, and disassociation was performed over a 600-second interval. Responses

335

from the protein surface were corrected for the response from a mock surface and for responses

336

from a buffer-only injection. SPR was performed with serially diluted serum of each animal in this

337

study. Antibody isotype analysis for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein bound antibodies in the

338

polyclonal serum was performed using SPR. Total antibody binding was calculated with BioRad

339

ProteOn manager software (version 3.1). All SPR experiments were performed twice and the

340

researchers performing the assay were blinded to sample identity. In these optimized SPR

341

conditions, the variation for each sample in duplicate SPR runs was <5%. The maximum resonance

16

342

units (Max RU) data shown in the figures was the RU signal for the 10-fold diluted serum sample.

343

Antibody off-rate constants, which describe the fraction of antigen–antibody complexes that decay

344

per second, are determined directly from the serum/ sample interaction with SARS CoV-2 spike

345

ectodomain (S1+S2), S1, S2, and RBD using SPR in the dissociation phase only for the

346

sensorgrams with Max RU in the range of 20–100 RU and calculated using the BioRad ProteOn

347

manager software for the heterogeneous sample model as described before(11). Off-rate constants

348

were determined from two independent SPR runs.

349

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus production and neutralization assay

351

Human codon-optimized cDNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein (NC_045512) was

352

synthesized by GenScript and cloned into eukaryotic cell expression vector pcDNA 3.1 between

353

the BamHI and XhoI sites. Pseudovirions were produced by co-transfection Lenti‐X 293T cells

354

with pMLV-gag-pol, pFBluc, and pcDNA 3.1 SARS-CoV-2 S using Lipofectamine 3000. The

355

supernatants were harvested at 48h and 72h post transfection and filtered through 0.45-mm

356

membranes.

357

For neutralization assay, 50 µL of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions were pre-incubated with

358

an equal volume of medium containing serum at varying dilutions at room temperature for 1 h,

359

then virus-antibody mixtures were added to Vero E6 cells in a 96-well plate. After a 3 h incubation,

360

the inoculum was replaced with fresh medium. Cells were lysed 48 h later, and luciferase activity

361

was measured using luciferin-containing substrate.

362
363

Gene Fragment Phage Display Library (GFPDL) construction

17

364

SARS-CoV-2 spike gene was chemically synthesized and used for cloning and

365

construction of phage display libraries. A gIII display-based phage vector, fSK-9-3, was used

366

where the desired polypeptide can be displayed on the surface of the phage as a gIII-fusion protein.

367

Purified DNA containing spike gene was digested with DNase I to obtain gene fragments of 100-

368

1000 bp size range and used for GFPDL construction as described previously (6-8). The phage

369

libraries constructed from the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene display viral protein segments ranging in

370

size from 30 to 350 amino acids, as fusion protein on the surface of bacteriophage.

371
372

Affinity selection of SARS-CoV-2 GFPDL phages with polyclonal rabbit serum

373

Prior to panning of GFPDL with polyclonal serum antibodies, serum components that

374

could non-specifically interact with phage proteins were removed by incubation with UV-killed

375

M13K07 phage-coated petri dishes (8). Equal volumes of each post-vaccination rabbit serum were

376

used for GFPDL panning. GFPDL affinity selection was carried out in-solution with protein A/G

377

(IgG) specific affinity resin as previously described (6, 7, 9) Briefly, the individual rabbit serum

378

was incubated with the GFPDL and the protein A/G resin, the unbound phages were removed by

379

PBST (PBS containing 0.1 % Tween-20) wash followed by washes with PBS. Bound phages were

380

eluted by addition of 0.1 N Gly-HCl pH 2.2 and neutralized by adding 8 µL of 2 M Tris solution

381

per 100 µL eluate. After panning, antibody-bound phage clones were amplified, the inserts were

382

sequenced, and the sequences were aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene, to define the fine

383

epitope specificity in the post-vaccination rabbit sera. The GFPDL affinity selection data was

384

performed blindly in a blinded fashion. Similar numbers of bound phage clones and epitope

385

repertoire were observed in the two GFPDL panning.
