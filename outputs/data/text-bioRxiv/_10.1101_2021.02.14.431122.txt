Abstract: Traditional medicines based on herbal extracts have been proposed as affordable
treatments for patients suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Teas and drinks containing
extracts of Artemisia annua and Artemisia afra have been widely used in Africa in efforts to
prevent and fight COVID-19 infections. We sought to study the ability of different A. annua
and A. afra extracts and the Covid-Organics drink produced in Madagascar to inhibit SARSCoV-2 and feline coronavirus (FCoV) replication in vitro. Several extracts as well as CovidOrganics inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and FCoV replication at concentrations that did not affect cell
viability. It remains unclear whether peak plasma concentrations in humans can reach levels
needed to inhibit viral replication following consumption of teas or Covid-Organics. Clinical
studies are required to evaluate the utility of these drinks for COVID-19 prevention or
treatment in patients.

1. Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)[1] has caused a pandemic of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)[2-4] that resulted in a rising death toll as well as
serious economic and societal consequences. Several vaccines were developed and
approved in record speed, and are now being distributed as quickly as possible.[5,6] Still,
affordable anti-viral treatments will still be needed for those that are not vaccinated or
where vaccines fail to work. The clinical benefits of Remdesivir, the only antiviral drug
approved for treatment of COVID-19, are being discussed controversially,[7] such that
COVID-19 treatment remains largely supportive. Repurposing of drugs already licensed for
other diseases is a comparatively fast method to meet the urgent need for effective
antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. Artesunate 2 and other synthetic derivatives of the
sesquiterpene lactone natural product artemisinin 1 that is isolated from Artemisia annua
plants, are the key active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of WHO-recommended anti-

malaria combination therapies, used in millions of patients every year with few side
effects.[8] Teas made from the leaves of A. annua plants are recommended in Traditional
Chinese Medicine to treat malaria [9] and teas from Artemisia plants are widely used in
many African countries to treat malaria patients, albeit contrary to WHO recommendations.

WHO-recommended anti-malarial medications.
Artemisinin and its synthetic derivatives have shown impressive effects against other
parasitic infections,[11] a range of different types of cancer[12] and viruses [13] in vitro and
in human clinical trials. In addition to pure, semi-synthetic substances, Artemisia teas and
plant material have been explored for use to treat different diseases.[14] A. annua extract
had shown anti-viral activity in vitro against SARS-CoV in 2005[15] and SARS-CoV-2 (EC50
value: 2.5 µg/mL)[16] [18]. Standardized A. annua extracts with high artemisinin content are
currently being studied in an ongoing phase 2 clinical trial against COVID-19 [17]. Artesunate
2 was significantly more active than A. annua extracts against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [16]. The
excellent safety profiles of artemisinin-based drugs in humans and their ready availability for
worldwide distribution at a relatively low cost render them attractive repurposing
candidates for treatment of COVID-19.
Early during the pandemic, traditional medicines made from plant extracts were employed
in various countries in efforts to prevent COVID-19 infections or treat COVID-19 patients. In
South Africa, teas of A. afra that – in contrast to A. annua – do not contain artemisinin 1,
were used widely without in vitro or clinical data.[19] In Madagascar, Covid-Organics, a drink
containing mainly A. annua extract and/or plant material, was announced by the President
of Madagascar Andry Rajoelina as a “miracle cure” in April 2020, subsequently used in the
country and exported to several African nations in hope to prevent and treat COVID-19
infections.[20] Due to fears that artemisinin combination therapies against malaria may
become ineffective if artemisinin-based treatments are used against COVID-19, the WHO
issued a warning against the use of traditional medicines.[21] More recently, the WHO
modified its recommendation and called for an investigation into the potential efficacy of
plant-based treatments.[22] To date, no in vitro data concerning anti-viral effects of A. afra
plant extracts or Covid-Organics has been disclosed. Here, we report that various A. annua
as well as A. afra plant extracts and Covid-Organics exhibit some anti-viral activity against
SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. It is unclear whether the plasma concentrations that can be achieved in
humans using such extracts are sufficient to prevent or treat COVID-19 infections. Human
clinical trials will be required to answer the question whether the traditional medicines may
indeed have an effect in preventing or treating COVID-19 infections.

2. Materials and Methods
Plant Material. Dried leaves of Artemisia plants grown in different countries and in different
years were obtained as donations (see supporting information). Covid-Organics was
purchased in Madagascar.
Extraction. Distilled water (10 mL) was heated to 90 °C in an Erlenmeyer flask. Dried plant
material (1 g) was added to the solvent and kept for two minutes at 90 °C, then 20 minutes
at room temperature. The mixture was filtered using filter paper and solid material washed
with fresh distilled water (20 x 2 mL). The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation and
the solid material was stored at -10 °C prior to sample preparation. An ethanolic extract of
A. annua var. CPQBA 1 was prepared by treating 100 g of dried leaves of A. annua with 1 L
of ethanol at 70 °C for 20 days.
Sample Preparation. Dried extract was warmed to room temperature before DMSO (3 mL)
was added and the mixture heated (40 °C) to ensure solvation. The solution was filtered
using a syringe filter and stored in a snap-close vial.
Cell Culture. African green monkey kidney VeroE6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) and Crandell-Rees
Feline Kidney (CRFK, ATCC CCL-94) cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Minimum
Essential Medium (MEM; PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (PAN Biotech), 100 IU/mL penicillin G and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Carl Roth,
Karlsruhe, Germany).
Virus isolates. The SARS-CoV-2 BavPat 1 isolate (SARS-CoV-2/human/Germany/BavPat
1/2020) was provided by Dr. Daniela Niemeyer and Dr. Christian Drosten (Charité, Berlin,
Germany) and obtained from an outbreak in Munich, Germany, in February 2020
(BetaCoV/Germany/BavPat1/2020). Feline coronavirus (ATCC VR-989, WSU 79-1683) was
propagated and titrated on CRFK cells.[23]
Plaque reduction antiviral assay. Tenfold dilutions of the compounds described above were
prepared in cell culture medium. To determine the effect of the compounds, dilutions were
incubated with 100 plaque forming units (PFU) of FCoV or SARS-CoV-2 for one hour at 37 °C.
To determine the antiviral effect, tenfold dilutions of the compound-virus mix was
incubated with CRFK or VeroE6 cells for 45 minutes at room temperature respectively. The
cells were washed with PBS once, overlayed with 1.3% methylcellulose containing medium
and plaque formation assessed two days post infection. Plaques of FCoV were stained with
specific antibodies (primary antibody: mouse anti feline coronavirus monoclonal antibody at
1:500 dilution solution, Bio-Rad; secondary antibody: Alexa 488-labeled goat anti-mouse at
a 1:500 dilution; Thermo Fisher) and counted manually by fluorescence microscopy (Axio
observer, Zeiss). SARS-CoV-2 plaques were stained using crystal violet.
Cell viability assays in VeroE6. To evaluate cytotoxic effects of the tested extracts,
compounds and diluent (DMSO), cell viability was studied using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8,
Merck, Germany). VeroE6 cells were seeded at 10,000 cells per well of flat bottom 96-well
plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Roskilde, Denmark). The next day, medium was exchanged
containing specified concentrations of the samples. Each concentration or dilution was
tested in three replicates; at least six nontreated control wells were included in the assay.
After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2, CCK8 Reagent (10 µL) was added per well and
plates were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, prior to recording absorbance at 450 nm using a
FLUOstar OPTIMA 96-well plate reader (BMG LABTECH, Offenburg, Germany). Absorbance
recorded in each well was related to the average absorbance of nontreated control wells to
calculate the percentage of cell viability. Sigmoidal dose response curves were fitted and
median cytotoxic concentration (CC50) values were calculated with GraphPad Prism 8.0.0.

3.2. Inhibition of feline coronavirus (FCoV) plaque formation by plant extracts and CovidOrganics
To assess the antiviral activity of the extracts and pure artemisinin, we first used the feline
coronavirus (FCoV), a biological safety level (BSL)2 coronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2 that
can be handled outside of a BSL3 facility. The extracts were diluted tenfold in DMEM
medium and incubated with FCoV solution with 100 PFU for 45 min at room temperature.
Virus and inhibitor mix were incubated with a monolayer of CRFK cells and plaque formation
assessed two days post infection. A typical dose-dependent curve of virus inhibition is
shown in Figure 2 (for details see the supporting information). All samples inhibited the
virus at high concentrations. The antiviral activity was clearly reduced below 2 mg/mL, as no
virus inhibition was observed, while all samples showed similar activity at the range of 5 –
10 mg/mL. The half maximal effective concentration (EC50) was estimated based on these
curves (Table 2). Covid-Organics showed moderate inhibitory activity against FCoV (Figure
S1, supporting information). The most promising samples based on the FCoV inhibition data
were selected for in vitro inhibition studies using SARS-CoV-2 in the BSL3 facility.

3.3. In vitro Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 plaque formation by Artemisia extracts and CovidOrganics
The extracts with the highest activity in on FCoV were subsequently tested for their antiviral
activity against SARS-CoV-2 using plaque reduction assays. SARS-CoV-2 plaque numbers
were reduced following incubation with the extracts at at 1.83 mg/mL, while no activity was
detected at 0.18 mg/mL. A. annua and A. afra aqueous extract as well as an A. annua
ethanolic extract showed the strongest inhibition with EC50 values below 1 mg/mL (Figure 3,
Table 2).
The cytotoxicity of all samples towards VeroE6 cells was assessed to ensure that any
antiviral effects were not caused by toxicity. Using the Cell Counting Kit-8, the 50% cytotoxic
concentration (CC50) of each extract in VeroE6 cells was determined and showed a similar
toxicity profile with a CC50 around 10-20 mg/mL (Table 2). The selectivity index (SI) was
assessed by comparing the EC50 against SARS-CoV-2 with the CC50 of the extracts. The
aqueous extracts of A. annua from Burkina Faso and Brazil and A. afra from France showed
an SI > 20. These tests confirmed that the extracts can inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2
at levels that are not toxic to the cells.
The Covid-Organics drink was first concentrated by rotary evaporation and then diluted for
the test. As the exact mass concentration was unknown, the inhibitory activity is shown as
percentage to the raw drinks (Table 3). The EC50 against SARS-CoV-2 was determined to be
7.73% of raw drink using the plaque reduction assay. The selectivity index was thereby 5.28.

4. Discussion
Natural products have been a rich source for the discovery of new drugs. For thousands of
years humans have turned to plants in attempts to prevent, alleviate, or heal different
diseases. Today, these “traditional medicines” have been broadly replaced by synthetic
active pharmaceutical ingredients. Still, compounds obtained by isolation from plants are
used in modern approaches to treat infectious diseases, cancer, and other ailments. Many
natural products exhibit antiviral activities.[24] Artemisinin, isolated from A. annua plants,
and the semi-synthetic derivative artesunate 2 obtained by chemical modification, inhibit a
variety of viruses[13] including SARS-CoV.[15] Given the similarities between SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2, we investigated the use of artemisinin 1 (Figure 1), artemisinin derivatives such
as artesunate 2, as well as A. annua extracts for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [16].
Artesunate was found to be most effective in inhibiting the virus, but A. annua extracts also
revealed some activity in vitro. Human phase 2 clinical trials are currently ongoing to test
the efficacy of these substances in treating COVID-19.[17] Other groups reported similar
findings concerning pure synthetic artemisinin derivatives[25] and whole A. annua plant
material.[18]
Reports that teas made from A. annua and A. afra plants,[19] as well as Covid-Organics, a
drink made from A. annua leaves and Ravensara aromatica in Madagascar,[20] have been
used throughout Africa. Our earlier observation that A. annua extracts can inhibit SARS-CoV2 in vitro prompted us to test whether such extracts can indeed inhibit coronaviruses. To
assess the inhibitory activity of the different plant extracts against two different
coronaviruses, the feline FCoV and a human isolate of SARS-CoV-2, we performed plaque
reduction assays in vitro. Screening of samples was performed using FCoV in a BSL-2 facility
in blind fashion. The activity of the most promising samples was subsequently tested in a
BSL3 facility using a SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Short pre-incubation with the extracts significantly
inhibited plaque formation of both viruses, indicating that the extracts suppress viral
replication in a dose dependent manner in vitro (Figure 3).
Some differences in the inhibitory activity against FCoV and SARS-CoV-2 were observed and
confirm reports that SARS-CoV-2 is more sensitive to antivirals than FCoV. The extracts, with
some slightly varying activities, were found to inhibit both coronavirus FCoV and SARS-CoV2. Among the active samples were extracts of A. annua and A. afra plants (Figure 3). This
finding was surprising considering that A. afra does not contain artemisinin and even more
so since synthetic artesunate, a pharmacokinetically improved derivative of artemisinin,
proved most active in previous in vitro SARS-CoV-2 inhibition studies [16, 25]. Our findings
suggest that not just artemisinin but also other compounds present in the Artemisia extracts
have inhibitory effects towards SARS-CoV-2. It has been suggested that flavonoids present in
Artemisia species are active against SARS-CoV-2.[27]
The commercial Covid-Organics drink prepared from A. annua plants was promoted by the
president of Madagascar in April 2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic without
any published scientific support as to its efficacy. Subsequently, a controversy around the
product and its use in several countries in Africa arose due to fears that the use of
artemisinin containing extracts may result in a resistance to this drug by Plasmodium
falciparum, the parasite that causes malaria. We felt it was important to test the extracts in
vitro and determine whether this product has any antiviral activity. In our in vitro test,
Covid-Organics was found to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 at the concentrations we investigated
(Figure 3), with an EC50 of 7.73% to raw drink and a selectivity index of 5.28. Covid-Organics

exhibited a higher antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 compared to FCoV, which could be
attributed the different interactions with the viruses and/or host cells. Even though
inhibition of virus infection is noticed, the selectivity index is not very promising.
For all samples – A. annua and A. afra extracts as well as Covid-Organics – tested, it remains
to be proven whether serum levels required to inhibit the virus can be reached in patients.
Extracts showed some toxicity at higher concentrations but the selectivity index of 10 opens
a useful therapeutic window to be explored in human clinical trials. It will have to be tested
whether such extracts exhibit activity in the upper respiratory tract.
Artemisia extracts used as teas and Covid-Organics may be potential countermeasures for
COVID-19. However, the in vitro inhibition data reported here needs to be followed up with
investigations in animal models as well as human clinical trials before recommendations for
use in patients can be made.
