ABSTRACT: Antiviral agents blocking SARS-CoV-2 viral replication are desperately needed to complement vaccination to end the
COVID-19 pandemic. Viral replication and assembly are entirely dependent on two viral cysteine proteases: 3C-like protease
(3CLpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro). PLpro also has deubiquitinase (DUB) activity, removing ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like
modifications from host proteins, disrupting the host immune response. 3CLpro is inhibited by many known cysteine protease inhibitors, whereas PLpro is a relatively unusual cysteine protease, being resistant to blockade by such inhibitors. A high-throughput screen
of biased and unbiased libraries gave a low hit rate, identifying only CPI-169 and the positive control, GRL0617, as inhibitors with
good potency (IC50 < 10 µM). Analogues of both inhibitors were designed to develop structure-activity relationships; however, without a co-crystal structure of the CPI-169 series, we focused on GRL0617 as a starting point for structure-based drug design, obtaining
several co-crystal structures to guide optimization. A series of novel 2-phenylthiophene-based non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 PLpro
inhibitors were obtained, culminating in low nanomolar potency. The high potency and slow inhibitor off-rate were rationalized by
newly identified ligand interactions with a “BL2 groove” that is distal from the active site cysteine. Trapping of the conformationally
flexible BL2 loop by these inhibitors blocks binding of viral and host protein substrates; however, until now it has not been demonstrated that this mechanism can induce potent and efficacious antiviral activity. In this study, we report that novel PLpro inhibitors
have excellent antiviral efficacy and potency against infectious SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell cultures. Together, our data provide
structural insights into the design of potent PLpro inhibitors and the first validation that non-covalent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2
PLpro can block infection of human cells with low micromolar potency.

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has
caused profound socioeconomic challenges for humankind.1
2,3
By the end of January 2021, the number of cases exceeded
100 million and over 2.2 million people have died from
COVID-19, with worldwide daily deaths still increasing and
deaths in the USA amplified by health disparities.4 Currently
approved antiviral agents have not effectively addressed the
current pandemic and we are learning belatedly that it is essential to proactively create new antiviral agents for future
outbreaks of this and other zoonotic viruses. The expedited
approval, distribution and administration of the first vaccines
is one important step in ending the pandemic. However, the
resurgence of COVID-19 in a population with high seroprevalence in Manaus, Brazil,5 questions the long-term effects of
immunoprotection. With the evolution and spread of new variants there exists an urgent need to develop small molecule
antiviral agents to treat patients who do not respond to or cannot tolerate vaccines and to address future outbreaks.
The early sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome has allowed comparisons with other coronaviruses including the
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and

the earlier SARS-CoV, which like SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to enter host
cells (Figure S1).6,7,8 SARS-CoV-2 shares 86% overall
amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV and ~ 50%
with MERS-CoV.2 The high homology of SARS-CoV-2 to
other coronaviruses has allowed the rapid understanding of viral biology, from particle attachment, entry, replication and
primary translation (polyprotein processing), assembly, maturation, to release and shedding.9,10 The SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein recognizes and attaches to ACE2 and utilizes the cell
surface serine protease TMPRSS2 to promote viral entry. 6,7
8,11
Following entry, viral RNA is translated by the host ribosome to yield two large overlapping open reading frames
(ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b. Two viral cysteine proteases, the
coronavirus main protease (3CLpro; nsp5) and the papain-like
protease (PLpro; nsp3), proteolytically process these two viral
polyproteins to yield individual non-structural proteins (nsps)
that then assemble in complexes with host membrane components.12 The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoded by
nsp12, a proteolytic product of 3CLpro, is a molecular target
of the FDA-approved COVID-19 treatment, remdesivir.13
PLpro recognizes the P4−P1 sequence LxGG and cleaves at
three sites to release nsps 1-3. Nsp3 (1922aa, 215 kDa) incorporates PLpro itself (residues 1602−1855) and is the largest

component of the replication and transcription complex.14,15
The catalytic activity of 3CLpro and PLpro is essential for viral replication, making inhibition of these enzymes a compelling strategy for antiviral therapy.
PLpro supports viral replication beyond the role of viral polyprotein processing, since host proteins are substrates for
PLpro. Specifically, PLpro disrupts the host innate immune
response by cleaving the isopeptide bond that ligates ubiquitin
(Ub) and ubiquitin-like proteins (UbL) such as interferonstimulated gene product 15 (ISG15) to lysine sidechains of
host proteins.16-22 Post translational modification of host proteins by Ub and UbL regulates the protein’s cellular localization, stability, or involvement in specialized responses such as
antiviral immunity. PLpro recognizes the C-terminal RLRGG
sequence of many Ub and UbLs acting as a deubiquitinase
(DUB) towards these host proteins. DUB activity is hypothesized to cause dysregulation of both the initial inflammatory
and subsequent interferon response. Substantial SARS-CoV2-related mortality is associated with a dysregulated inflammatory response culminating in a cytokine storm.23 Thus, targeting PLpro is an attractive, strategy to inhibit viral replication and to prevent disruption of the host immune response to
viral infection.
There has been a flurry of interest in drug repurposing as an
expedited approach to address the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the lack of tangible success from repurposing approaches
to the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks in 2002/3 and
2012/3, respectively. 24,25 Of the two essential cysteine proteases of SARS-CoV-2, 3CLpro is inhibited by many known
cysteine protease inhibitors, the majority of which act via covalent modification of the active site cysteine and would seem
to be a more amenable target for repurposing. The promiscuity
of many human cysteine protease inhibitors has held back the
progress of these agents into clinical use;26 however, off-target
inhibition by calpain-1 inhibitors of cathepsin-L and 3CLpro
may be opportunistically exploited, since cathepsin-L facilitates viral entry.27 Discovery of PF-008352313 as a covalent
active-site-directed inhibitor of SARS-CoV 3CLpro in 2003
allowed the relatively rapid translation of this agent into clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 in 2020.28
Like 3CLpro, PLpro from SARS-CoV-2 has 100% active site
homology with the enzyme from SARS-CoV. In contrast to
3CLpro, there are very few potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV
PLpro with efficacy validated experimentally; therefore, targeting PLpro with repurposed drugs is likely to be futile.29-32
A key reason for the lack of potent PLpro inhibitors is the absence of well-defined binding pockets at the S1 and S2 sites
(Gly-Gly recognition). This presents severe challenges for inhibitor design and precludes a rapid drug discovery campaign.33 Furthermore, the relatively speedy resolution of the
SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003 prematurely curtailed a number
of early drug discovery campaigns. Notably, the resolution of
crystal structures of the SARS-CoV PLpro apoenzyme by Ratia et al. demonstrated a conformationally flexible BL2 loop,
remote from the active site cysteine, which could be stabilized
by small molecule SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors. 34 However,
several of these inhibitors had reported poor metabolic stability, and the best, GRL0617, attained 14.5 µM potency in inhibition of host cell death to infectious SARS-CoV. 35-37
Utilizing our experience with SARS-CoV PLpro, we established a robust high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to
identify SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors from both an unbiased
and a targeted biased library. Based on observations with

SARS-CoV PLpro, a low hit rate was expected; nevertheless,
we identified CPI-169 as a validated and non-covalent SARSCoV-2 PLpro inhibitor. We attempted to derive structure-activity relationships for synthetic analogues of CPI-169, which
we computationally docked to the BL2 loop of PLpro; however, we were unable to obtain co-crystal structures. In parallel, we explored synthetic analogues of the known SARS-CoV
PLpro inhibitor, GRL0619, for which a SARS-CoV PLpro cocrystal structure was available. We synthesized a chemical library of almost 100 compounds and identified nine compounds with low nanomolar potency against SARS-CoV-2
PLpro. Co-crystal structures of a number of these inhibitors
with SARS-CoV-2 PLpro were obtained, revealing a novel
“BL2 groove” formed by closing of the BL2 loop (blocking
loop 2, AA266-271) and the palm domain. Structure-based
optimization led to PLpro inhibitors with increased metabolic
stability, low nanomolar potency against PLpro enzyme activity, a relatively slow dissociation rate, and low micromolar
potency against infectious SARS-CoV-2. These novel compounds represent the most potent inhibitors of PLpro reported
to date with activity translating to infectious virus assays in
mammalian and human host cells.

RESULTS:
High-throughput screening to identify inhibitors of SARSCoV-2 PLpro. To discover novel chemical scaffolds that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, we performed an HTS assay measuring PLpro protease activity with the short peptide substrate
Z-RLRGG-AMC. Assay performance was excellent, with
plate Z’ values ranging from 0.85-0.90. An unbiased
ChemDiv library (10,000-compound SMART library subset
excluding PAINS compounds) and a biased, annotated TargetMol Bioactive library (5,370 compounds) were screened.
The Bioactive library contains 1,283 FDA-approved drugs,
761 drugs approved by regulatory bodies in other countries
such as European Medicines Agency (EMA), and 3,326 advanced-stage developmental candidates. Compounds were
screened against PLpro at a final compound concentration of
20 µM, which is a more stringent threshold than other contemporary screens of PLpro.38 Assay of PLpro in the presence
of 5 mM DTT, as reducing agent and electrophile trap,

strongly biases against reactive (electrophilic and redox) hits.

Binding of GRL0617 and CPI-169 to SARS-CoV-2 PLpro as measured by SPR.

The 28 hit compounds from HTS were counter-assayed to remove false positives associated with signal interference and
then further pruned to remove frequent hitters and known redox cyclers (Figure 1 & Figure S2A, B). A set of five compounds producing >40% inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro
activity along with the SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitor GRL0617
were selected for follow-up 8-point dose-response assays
(Figures 2A). All six active compounds were also tested in an
orthogonal binding assay using surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) (8-point titration) (Figure 2B). Only GRL0617 and
CPI-169 inhibited PLpro with IC50 < 10 µM in the primary
enzyme inhibition assay (IC50 values of 1.6 µM and 7.3 µM,
respectively (Figure 2A). These values compare well with the
binding affinities measured by SPR: GRL0617 KD= 1.9 µM,
CPI-169 KD = 10.2 µM (Figure 2C).
PLpro has DUB enzyme activity; therefore, human DUBs represent off-targets for any PLpro inhibitor. To confirm that hits
were selective for SARS-CoV-2 PLpro over host cell DUBs,
the catalytic domain of human USP7, the closest structural
homolog of PLpro, was used as an additional counter-assay.
Consistent with the initial findings, GRL0617 did not inhibit
USP7-catalyzed Ub-AMC hydrolysis.29 Similarly, CPI-169
was not able to inhibit USP7 up to a concentration of 30 µM
(Figure S2C). This data confirmed and validated GRL0617
and CPI-169 as selective SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors.
Structure-based design of PLpro inhibitors. With these two
inhibitors in hand, we embarked on a medicinal chemistry
campaign to optimize both GRL0617 and CPI-169 (SAR for
CPI-169 will be reported in a separate paper). As shown
above, GRL0617 displayed only modest potency against
SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. Furthermore, this family of compounds
was reported to be unstable to metabolism by liver cytochrome P450s, probably due to the presence of aniline and
naphthalene groups, which are known culprits for rapid metabolism, precluding use as in vivo probe compounds.32,39 Any
modifications to the GRL0617 series would need to incorporate improved potency and metabolic stability.

SARS-CoV-2 PLpro has 83% sequence identity to SARSCoV PLpro and 100% identity at the active site; therefore, the
GRL0617:PLpro (SARS-CoV) co-crystal structure (PDB:
3E9S) can be used to guide initial structure-based optimization of this series. The PLpro monomer is comprised of four
distinct domains, including an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl)
domain (first 62 residues) and an extended right-hand architecture with distinct palm, thumb, and finger domains (Figure
3A). The active site formed by the catalytic triad, Cys111,
His272, and Asp286 (SARS-CoV-2 PLpro numbering, PDB:
7JRN), sits in a solvent-exposed cleft at the interface of the
thumb and palm domains. Binding of host and viral protein
substrates is controlled by the flexible β-hairpin BL2 loop,
which contains an unusual beta-turn formed by Tyr268 and
Gln269 (Figures 3A, B), controlling access to the active site.
Superposition of crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro
apoenzyme (PDBs 6WZU, 7D47, 7JCD) highlights the flexibility of the BL2 loop (Figure 3C). The binding of GRL0617,
presumably by induced-fit, requires reorganization of the
PLpro secondary structure, and thus the association rate of the
ligand is anticipated to be slower than the rate of diffusion. In
SPR experiments, the association rate was measured to be 1.8
x 105 M-1s-1, which is significantly slower than the expected
1x109 M-1s-1 rate of diffusion-controlled association. The
unique structural reorganization of the BL2 loop, in part, explains the low hit rate from our HTS campaign (as also reported by others40) and represents a challenge and an opportunity for developing potent, selective small molecule PLpro
inhibitors.
In the GRL0617:PLpro (SARS-CoV) co-crystal structure, the
ligand stabilizes the closed BL2 loop, blocking access to the
active site; thus, unusually for a cysteine protease inhibitor,
GRL0617 does not interact with the active site cysteine and
the closest point of contact is 7.6Å distant. We hypothesized
that CPI-169 also stabilizes the BL2 loop; however, we were
unable to obtain co-crystal structures of CPI-169 or its analogues with SARS-CoV-2 PLpro to guide optimization.

Optimization of novel benzamide PLpro inhibitors.
GRL0617 forms two key hydrogen bonding interactions with
the mainchain nitrogen of Gln269 and sidechain of Asp164 in
PLpro (Figure 3B), causing the BL2 loop to adopt a twisted
conformation that narrows the solvent-exposed surface and
exposes a hydrophobic binding site. To test the importance of
this hydrogen bonding interaction in regulating the BL2 loop
conformation, we synthesized two tool compounds reducing
the amide to amine (DY2-64) or replacing the amide with a
sulfonamide bioisostere (DY3-63). Both modifications led to
a sharp decline in potency, therefore the benzamide was conserved moving forward (Table S1).
A detailed analysis of residues within the GRL0617 binding
site of PLpro revealed five potential regions that we hypothesized could be targeted to increase affinity and potency for
BL2-binding ligands (I-V, Figure 3D,E). Compounds extended into Site I explore potential interactions with Glu167,
which forms electrostatic contacts with the Arg72 of ubiquitin
in the Ub:PLpro SARS-CoV co-crystal structure (PDB:
4MM3) (Figure 3F).19 We envisioned that a basic amine appended to the aniline group would capture this interaction and
improve binding affinity. A library of 16 compounds was synthesized to identify suitable basic side chains (Figure 3E).
The azetidine-substituted ZN2-184 was the most potent analogue targeting Site I, with a two-fold improvement relative to
GRL0617, which correlated with affinity measured by SPR.
The increase in affinity and potency was also accompanied by
a twofold increase in rate of association (Figure 4A-D).

Site II is located at the S3 site of the substrate-binding channel,
which is formed by the BL2 loop, helix 5, and neighboring
hydrophobic residues Tyr264, Tyr273, and Leu162 (Figure
3D). Small hydrophobic moieties such as a halogen or trifluoromethyl group were synthesized to probe the hydrophobic interaction at this site (Figure 3E, Table S2). Interestingly,
small substitutions such as methyl to fluorine at Site II led to
a dramatic decrease in potency. Only bromo and chloro substituents did not significantly right-shift potency. Attempts to
make fused-ring indole analogs to replace aniline also did not
lead to any improvement in potency.
Site III is positioned next to the charged side chains of Arg166
and Asp164 (Figure 3D). Arg166 forms an electrostatic interaction with Asp164 via its charged guanidino group, leaving
the other guanidine nitrogens available for hydrogen bonding
interactions. In the Ub:PLpro complex, this interaction is captured by hydrogen bonding to the Gln49 of ubiquitin (Figure
3F). To exploit hydrogen bonding with Arg166 at Site III, we
synthesized analogues modified at the: 1) 2-napthelene position; 2) α-methyl position; and 3) aniline nitrogen, all without
success (Tables S2-4). Indeed, minor modifications, such as
ZN3-36 with a 2-isoquinoline, designed to engage with a
structurally conserved water molecule at Site III, significantly
lost activity against PLpro (IC50 = 56 µM, Figure 3D, Table
S4). Conformational minimization (B3LYP/6-31G* with a
polarizable continuum model for aqueous solvation) indicated
a dihedral angle of 27.9o between the amide and isoquinoline
planes of ZN3-36 (Figure S3). This angle is significantly different from that seen in the crystal structure of GRL-0617

(81.7o, PDB: 7JRN), which may highlight the importance of
maintaining a dihedral angle ~ 90o for optimal hydrogen bonding with the BL2 loop (Figure S3).
Extending from the α-methyl position also proved to be futile.
A minor ethyl modification led to a significant decrease in potency (ZN3-61); further expansion from this position resulted
in almost completely inactive compounds such as DY2-97 and
DY2-116 (Table S3). Only ZN3-56 with a glycine tail extended from the aniline site could engage with Site III and led
to a slight improvement of potency over GRL0617. The proposed binding model of ZN3-56 predicts an electrostatic interaction with Arg 166 (Figure S4); however, this incremental
improvement in potency suggests that electrostatic stabilization at this highly solvent-exposed region is counterbalanced
by a solvation penalty. No further exploration of Site III interactions was attempted.
Scaffold hopping: naphthalene ring replacement. Although the active sites of PLpro from SARS-CoV and SARS
CoV-2 are identical, there are several amino acids that differ
between the two enzymes, which are within approximately
10Å of the binding site of BL2-stabilizing ligands GRL-0617
(e.g., E251/Q250 and N263/S262). It is reasonable to assume
that these substitutions might subtly alter ligand binding to the
BL2 loop in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro versus SARS-CoV. This observation alone supports exploration of scaffolds to replace
the naphthalene of GRL0617. Retaining the essential geometry between the benzamide and naphthalene rings should be
possible using heteroaryl or bi-aryl group replacements. Replacement of the naphthalene ring is also anticipated to reduce
metabolic instability.30 Modifications at this site should also
allow favorable interactions with Site IV (Figure 3D). Fused

heteroaryls such as benzothiophene, indole, and carbazole
with various linkages were prepared and tested (Table S4);
however, most modifications weakened or lost activity. Only
the 3-benzothiophene (ZN3-79) and the carbazole-based
(DY2-153) analogues showed comparable potency to
GRL0617 (IC50 = 1.9 µM and 1.8 µM, respectively; Table
S4). In contrast, the biaryl analogues not only retained the activity of GRL0617 but also gained potency. Both 2-phenylthiophene (ZN-3-80; IC50 = 0.59 µM) and 3-phenylthiophene
(XR8-8; IC50 = 1.3 µM) demonstrated enhanced potency (Table S5). Importantly, ZN3-80, the most potent analog in this
subset, was found to be more stable than GRL0617 in human
liver microsome stability assays (Table S6), which encouraged us to explore further optimization.
Engaging the BL2 groove decreases inhibitor off-rate and
improves potency. Examination of crystal structures identified a ligand binding site, coined the “BL2 groove” (Site V,
Figure 3D), which is positioned at the N-terminal side of the
BL2 loop and features hydrophobic residues such as Pro248
and Pro299 and potential hydrogen bonding partners such as
the backbone amide of Gly266. With an optimized 2-phenylthiophene (ZN3-80) in hand, we explored derivatization to exploit further interactions with the BL2 groove, synthesizing
22 compounds. Interestingly, nine compounds in this family
significantly impacted potency, improving IC50 to below 500
nM (Figure 4A; Table S5).
We hypothesized that once bound, these extended ligands interacting with Sites I-V might have slower off-rates because
of the increased conformational reorganization of the BL2
loop required for ligand release (Figure S5 & Table S8). As-

sociation and dissociation rates were measured by SPR (Figure 4B). The extended ligands, designed to engage the BL2
groove, showed a marked decrease in dissociation rates (Figure 4C). For example, both XR8-23 and XR8-89, with basic
amine side chains extending from the thiophene of ZN3-80,
produced 4-fold and 9-fold reductions in off rates compared
with GRL0617, respectively; suggesting that BL2 groove engagement is a novel strategy for development of potent PLpro
inhibitors with slower off-rates.
To confirm that the improved analogs are capable of inhibiting the DUB activity of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, we studied both
Ub-AMC (Figure 4E) and ISG-15-AMC (Figure 4F) as substrates for the enzyme at three inhibitor concentrations. Complete ablation of DUB activity was observed with all tested
inhibitors at 30 µM and at the approximate IC50 concentration
for GRL0617, all novel inhibitors produced greater inhibition
of DUB activity. The data support the ability of these novel
inhibitors to block SARS-CoV-2 PLpro-mediated deubiquitination and deISGylation of host proteins involved in host immune response.
Co-crystal structures of XR8-23 and XR8-89 with SARSCoV-2 PLpro. To examine the binding mode of our novel
PLpro inhibitors and test the proposed binding site hypotheses, we obtained co-crystal structures of XR8-24, XR8-65,
XR8-69, XR8-83, and XR8-89 complexed with SARS-CoV2 PLpro. Superposition of the ligand-bound structures shows
all inhibitors enforcing the same binding mode of the BL2
loop (Figure S6). Focusing on the co-crystal structures of
XR8-24 and XR8-89, we observe that the azetidine ring extends into Site I to within 3 Å of Glu168, likely engaging in
the postulated electrostatic stabilizing interaction (Figure 5A,
B). The amide group of XR8-24 and XR8-89 is aligned
closely with that of GRL0617 in SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (PDB:
7JRN) with the expected: i) carbonyl hydrogen bonding to the
mainchain of Gln269 on the BL2 loop; and ii) amide nitrogen
hydrogen bonding to Asp164 of helix 5. In Site IV, the 2-phenylthiophene of the ligand retains the T-shaped pi-interaction

with Tyr268, as seen for the naphthalene ring of GRL0617;
however, there is a shift in the biaryl ring of XR8-24 relative
to the naphthalene of GRL0617, suggesting that the biaryl
substituent maximizes interactions that may not be present in
PLpro from SARS-CoV. These interactions place the thiophene firmly in the BL2 groove (Site V), where it takes part in
van der Waals interactions with residues surrounding the cavity (Pro248, Tyr264, Tyr268; Figure 5D).
The “tail” of both XR8-24 and XR8-89, which we postulated
to provide interactions with the BL2 groove in these co-crystal
structures sits perpendicular to the thiophene and adjacent to
the body of the protein near Pro248 and Pro299. The lack of
electron density for the tail of XR8-89 (Figure 5B), also observed for the co-crystal structures of XR8-65, XR8-69 and
XR8-83 indicates that this region is largely disordered, which
may be due in part both to high solvent-exposure and crystal
packing forces induced by the proximity to a second symmetry-related monomer. However, the tail of XR8-24 is better
defined, with the pyrrolidine ring forming a putative watermediated hydrogen bond to the mainchain carbonyl oxygens
of Tyr264 and Gly266 (Figure 5D). The new co-crystal structures show that engagement of the BL2 groove contributes to
binding affinity and we emphasize that this binding interaction is unique and is not observed in structures of SARS CoV2 PLpro in complex with ubiquitin or ISG15, nor with any
known PLpro inhibitors (Figure 5E).
Improved potency translates to improved antiviral activity. Of the potent, novel PLpro inhibitors, selection for antiviral testing was based on the following rationale: XR8-89
demonstrated highest potency for PLpro inhibition (IC50=113
nM); XR8-23 demonstrated a high association/dissociation
rate ratio; and XR8-24 yielded a superior co-crystal structure.
No toxicity was observed under assay conditions in Vero E6
cells for these compounds at < 50 µM; therefore, we evaluated
all three compounds compared with GRL0617 in a plaque formation assay using the SARS-CoV-2 USA/WA1/2020 strain.

Vero E6 cells are known to express high levels of efflux transporter proteins.41 In a report on the 3CLpro inhibitor, PF00835231, currently in clinical trials for COVID-19, co-treatment with the dual P-gp/BCRP inhibitor, CP-100356, was required to elicit antiviral activity in Vero E6 cells. 42 In Caco2 cells, XR8-24 demonstrated a high efflux ratio (Table S7),
implying efficient P-gp mediated efflux; therefore CP-100356
co-treatment (1.5 µM) was used to test antiviral activity in
Vero E6 cells. Consistent with reports on PF-00835231, CP100356 itself had no antiviral activity and at the tested concentrations did not influence cytotoxicity alone or in combination with our PLpro inhibitors. Consistent with contemporary reports on GRL0617,21 an EC50 of 21.7 ± 1.6 µM was
measured against infectious SARS-CoV-2 in an eight-point
dose response assay. Both XR8-23 and XR8-24 were significantly more potent than GRL0617 with EC50 measured at 2.8
± 0.4 µM and 2.5 ± 1.9 µM, respectively (Figure 6A and Figure S7). XR8-89 also demonstrated superior antiviral potency
to GRL017; however, antiviral potency did not correlate with
the superior potency of this inhibitor in biochemical assays.
The lack of observable cytotoxicity for XR8-89 might indicate
attenuated cell permeability as a cause of lower antiviral potency.

The two most potent antiviral agents in Vero E6 cells, XR823 and XR8-24, were tested and compared to GRL0617 and
remdesivir, an FDA-approved COVID-19 antiviral agent, in
the human lung epithelial A549 cell line stably overexpressing the human ACE2 receptor. Although monkey Vero E6
cells are a standard model for antiviral testing, a human cell
line provides an orthogonal and more relevant model system.
Viral RNA was assayed by RT-qPCR as a measure of replication of infectious SARS-CoV-2 USA/WA1/2020. The assay
was conducted in the absence of CP-100356 and cytotoxicity
was not observed under assay conditions at < 50 µM for XR824 and < 10 µM for XR8-23 (Figure S8). The antiviral activity
of novel PLpro inhibitors was markedly superior to that of
GRL0617 in this model system (Figure 6B). Both XR8-23
and XR8-24 were again significantly more potent than
GRL0617 (IC50 > 20 µM) with IC50 measured at 1.4 ± 0.1 µM
and 1.2 ± 0.2 µM, respectively. By unpaired nonparametric ttest: 1) the effect of treatment with XR8-23 and XR8-24 (1.3
µM) was significantly different from vehicle control; and 2)
the effect of treatment with XR8-24 (20 µM) was not significantly different from that of remdesivir (10 µM).

DISCUSSION

reportedly in clinical trials for COVID-19 as a PLpro
inhibitor, 46 was inactive in our screen. We did identify
avasimibe and candesartan as weak PLpro inhibitors;
however, only GRL0617 and CPI-169 (initially developed as
an EZH2 inhibitor) were validated as hits with
potency/affinity < 10 µM in both enzymatic assay and SPR
binding assays. CPI-169 represents a novel chemical scaffold
and a novel addition to the very limited PLpro inhibitor
chemotypes identified in the literature.33,50
Given the availability of co-crystal structures of
GRL0617:PLpro (SARS-CoV-2), structure-guided drug
design was pursued exploring this chemical scaffold. Five
binding sites on PLpro were explored by modification of the
benzamide scaffold to identify additional interactions to
increase inhibitor potency. Site I contains Glu167, which
forms a salt bridge with Arg72 of ubiquitin in the Ub:PLpro
complex. This electrostatic interaction was captured with
addition of a basic amine side chain in novel inhibitors to yield
a significant increase in binding and potency. Additional
modifications to engage with the S1 or S2 sites in the channel
leading to the catalytic site were unsuccesful, consistent with
recent findings profiling substrate specificity using a
combinatorial library.51 Site III is defined by Arg166, which
forms a hydrogen bonding interaction with Gln49 of
ubiquitin; however, none of the modifications designed to
mimic this interaction increased the affinity of inhibitors for
PLpro. Site III, therefore, remains to be exploited in future
work.
The BL2 groove is a new binding site identified in the process
of inhibitor optimization, which was confirmed and validated
by obtaining SARS-CoV-2 PLpro co-crystal structures. This
BL2 groove is not involved in the binding of any PLpro
substrates, such as Ubs and Ubls, by the enzyme. Novel
inhibitors, such as XR8-23 and XR8-24, modified with BL2interacting side chains, showed both improved binding
affinity and slower off-rates, suggesting that BL2 groove
interactions can yield more efficacious PLpro inhibitors.
Gratifyingly, these enhanced biochemical properties
translated to antiviral efficacy against infectious SARS-CoV-

The pathogenesis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is
characterized by a strong dysregulation of the innate immune
and the type I interferon (IFN-I) responses.43 The viral protein,
PLpro, represents an excellent therapeutic target owing to
multi-functional roles: i) in mediating viral replication via
processing of the viral polyprotein; and ii) in reversing hostmediated post-translational modifications in response to viral
infection via its actions as a DUB. The DUB enzyme activity
of PLpro is responsible for removing ubiquitin chains and the
ISG15 ubiquitin-like (Ubl) modification from host proteins.
ISGylation of proteins is induced during viral infection as a
host antiviral signaling mechanism.44 Interestingly, despite
the close homology of PLpro from SARS-CoV-2 and from the
original SARS-CoV coronovirus, PLpro has been claimed
differentially to modulate the host immune system:
specifically, it is reported that SARS-CoV-2 PLpro
preferentially cleaves ISG15, whereas PLpro from SARSCoV predominantly targets ubiquitin chains.20,45 In addition to
Ub- and Ubl-modified host proteins, the autophagy-activating
kinase, ULK1, is also a substrate for PLpro, cleaving the Nterminal kinase domain from a C-terminal substrate
recognition region to disrupt autophagy during early viral
replication.46 Pharmacological inhibitors of PLpro are needed
to probe the effects of PLpro proteolytic activity on host cell
immune response and autophagy; however, more urgent is the
need for PLpro inhibitors that effectively block viral
replication, since many SARS-CoV-2 gene products in
addition to PLpro have immune modulatory effects.
Towards developing potent inhibitors, we developed a robust
high-throughput assay for SARS-CoV-2 PLpro using ZRLRGG-AMC to screen chemical libraries including FDAapproved drugs and molecules in clinical trials (15,370
molecules). Consistent with contemporary reports,38,40,47 an
extremely low hit rate was observed, which makes
repurposing of approved drugs as therapeutically useful
PLpro inhibitors problematic. As recent reports have noted,
the experimental data is not in accordance with in silico
repurposing predictions:48,49
for example, isotretinoin

2 (USA/WA1/2020) in Vero E6 green monkey kidney
epithelial cells and A549 human lung epithelial cells. The low
micromolar potency observed in inhibition of viral plaque
formation was superior to GRL0617 and suggests that
optimization of PLpro inhibitors as therapeutic agents for
SARS-CoV-2 is feasible. Vero E6 cells are highly susceptible
to the cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in contrast
to many human cell lines.52 The observations in a human lung
epithelial cell line of inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 viral
replication is therefore very promising. Novel PLpro
inhibitors were markedly more efficacious than GRL0617,
with significant suppression of viral RNA at low micromolar
concentrations.
PLpro inhibitors such as XR8-23 and XR8-24 provide an
opportunity to study combination therapy with FDAapproved RdRp inhibitors such as remdesivir, or 3CLPro
inhibitors such as PF-00835231, now in Phase I/II clinical
trials. Genotyping of SARS-CoV-2 virus strains circulating
worldwide has identified multiple recurrent non-synonymous
mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike
protein. For example, the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 strain
identified in London contains a N501Y mutation in the RBD
domain. Variants with multiple mutations in the spike protein
pose a risk of resistance to current FDA-approved vaccines
and therapeutic antibodies; mutations in the cysteine proteases
3CLpro and PLpro have not been reported.
In conclusion, we identified a new drug-like PLpro inhibitor
chemotype, CPI-169, adding to the very limited examples of
PLpro inhibitor scaffolds. Guided by new SARS-CoV-2
PLpro co-crystal structures, we designed novel non-covalent
PLpro inhibitors that exhibited superior nanomolar potency
and inhibited PLpro DUB activity, without inhibiting human
DUBs. Biochemical potency, affinity, and slow off-rates
translated to low micromolar potency against infectious
SARS-CoV-2 in primate and human cell lines. Non-covalent
inhibitors that stabilize the BL2 loop by induced fit do not
occupy the active site of PLpro and published data on SARSCoV PLpro inhibitors showed relatively weak potency against
infectious virus; therefore, the therapeutic relevance of this
approach in SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapy was problematic.
We have shown that BL2-stabilizing PLpro inhibitors have
therapeutically relevant activity against SARS-CoV-2.
We synthesized almost 100 analogues during structure-based
optimization, identifying the novel BL2 groove as an
important ligand binding site. The newly identified noncovalent inhibitors described herein are the most potent
SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors reported to date, with
improved potency and metabolic stability. The infectious
virus data suggests that administration in combination with
remdesivir or 3CLpro inhibitors may be therapeutically
beneficial. Moreover, potent PLpro inhibitors such as XR8-23
and XR8-24 represent chemical probe tool compounds to
study the details of PLpro-mediated disruption of host
immune response and autophagy; and their contribution to
COVID-19 infection and progression, including “longCOVID” and potential genetic bias.53,54

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SARS-CoV-2 PLpro expression and purification: pET11a
vector containing SARS-CoV-2 PLpro protein (pp1ab aa
1564-1878) with N-terminal, TEV-cleavable His-tag was
transformed into BL21(DE3) cells and maintained in media
containing 100 ug/mL carbenicillin. Protein expression was

induced using an auto-induction protocol modified from Studier et al.55 Briefly, 1 mL day cultures were used to inoculate a
2L flask of 500 mL of Super LB containing 100 ug/mL carbenicillin. Cells were grown for 24h at 25°C and then harvested by centrifugation. All steps of SARS-CoV2 PLpro purification were performed at 4°C. Protein yield at each step
was monitored by Bradford assay using BSA as a standard.
Frozen cells pellets were lysed by sonication in Buffer A (50
mM HEPES, pH 8, 0.5 M NaCl) containing 10 ug/mL lysozyme. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and loaded
onto a 2-mL HiTrap Talon crude column equilibrated with
Buffer A. Bound His6-PLpro was eluted with a linear gradient
of 0-150 mM imidazole in Buffer A, and fractions containing
His6-PLpro were pooled and exchanged into cleavage buffer
(20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA, 5%
glycerol). A 1:100 molar ratio of TEV protease to PLpro was
incubated at 4°C overnight to cleave the His6-tag. To remove
the tag and TEV protease, the reaction was loaded onto a
UNO-Q column equilibrated with 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 8.5, 3
mM DTT. Cleaved PLpro eluted first in a gradient from 0-150
mM NaCl over 20 column volumes. Fractions containing
cleaved PLpro were pooled and concentrated to 12 mg/mL,
frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C.
PLpro primary assay: The PLpro primary assay, which
measures protease activity with the short peptide substrate ZRLRGG-AMC (Bachem), was performed in black, flat-bottom 384-well plates containing a final reaction volume of 50
μL. The assays were assembled at room temperature as follows: 40 µL of 50 nM PLpro in Buffer B (50 mM HEPES,
pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 0.01% Triton-X 100, and 5 mM
DTT) was dispensed into wells containing 0.1-1 uL of inhibitor in DMSO or appropriate controls. The enzyme was incubated with inhibitor for 10 min prior to substrate addition. Reactions were initiated with 10 µL of 62.5 μM RLRGG-AMC
in Buffer B. Plates were shaken vigorously for 30 s, and fluorescence from the release of AMC from peptide was monitored continuously for 15 min on a Tecan Infinite M200 Pro
plate reader (λexcitation=360 nm; λemission=460 nm). Slopes from
the linear portions of each progress curve were recorded and
normalized to plate-based controls. Positive control wells,
representing 100% inhibition, included 10 µM GRL0617;
negative control wells, representing 0% inhibition, included
vehicle.
PLpro high-throughput screening: High-throughput
screening for inhibitors of PLpro was performed using the primary assay above. Test compounds (20 uM final concentration) and controls were delivered via 100 nL pin tool (V&P
Scientific). The libraries included in the screen were purchased from TargetMol (Bioactive Library) and ChemDiv (a
10,000-compound SMART library subset). Each 384-well
plate contains 32 positive control wells and 32 negative control wells. Average Z’ values for this assay ranged from 0.850.90. Compounds producing >40% inhibition of PLpro activity were selected for follow-up analysis. To eliminate compounds that interfered with AMC fluorescence and thus produced false positives, the fluorescence of 10 μM free AMC
was measured in the presence of 20 µM compound in Buffer
B. Inhibitors that produced a >25% decrease in AMC fluorescence signal were eliminated from further analysis. Similarly,
compounds that were frequent hitters in in-house screens, or
that were documented redox-cycling compounds, were eliminated from follow-up studies.

where x is the concentration of inhibitor and n is the Hill coefficient.
The selectivity of the most potent inhibitors was tested against
the human deubiquitinating enzymes USP7 and USP14 (Boston Biochem). Assay conditions were similar to the PLpro primary assay, with the following substitutions: USP7 assays
contained 4 nM USP7 and 0.5 uM Ub-AMC (Boston Biochem); USP14 assays contained 1.7 uM USP14, 4 uM UbAMC, and the addition of 5% glycerol to Buffer B.
PLpro activity with ISG15-AMC and Ub-AMC were assayed
in a manner similar to the PLpro primary assay. PLpro and
substrate concentrations were modified as follows: 80 nM
PLpro was assayed with 0.5 uM Ub-AMC, and 4 nM PLpro
was assayed with 0.5 uM ISG15-AMC.
Crystallization: Crystals of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro complexed
with XR compounds were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 16°C. Prior to crystallization, 12 mg/mL PLpro protein was incubated with 2 mM XR824 (or XR865, XR869,
XR883, XR889) for 30 min on ice. Crystals of the complexes
were grown by mixing 1-2 uL of PLpro:inhibitor complex
with 2 uL of reservoir solution containing 0.1 M MIB buffer,
pH 7.2, 0.2 M (NH4)2SO4, and 24-28% PEG 4000 or 0.1 MIB
buffer, pH 6.0-6.8, 0.2 M (NH4)2SO4, 13-16% PEG 3350,
and 20% glycerol. Crystals grew overnight from the PEG
4000 conditions and were used to streak seed drops of
PLpro:inhibitor equilibrating against the PEG 3350 conditions.
Secondary binding analysis by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). The His-tagged SARS-CoV-2 PLpro enzyme
was initially prepared in phosphate buffer and diluted to 50
µg/mL with 10 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.5) and immobilized
on a CM5 sensor chip by standard amine-coupling with running buffer PBSP (10 mM phosphate, pH 7.4, 2.7 mM KCl,
137 mM NaCl, 0.05 % Tween-20). The CM5 sensor chip surface was first activated by 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)
carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC)/N-hydroxy succinimide
(NHS) mixture using a Biacore 8K instrument (Cytiva).
SARS-CoV-2 PLpro enzyme was immobilized to flow channels 1 through 4 followed by ethanolamine blocking on the
unoccupied surface area, and immobilization levels for all
four channels were similar at ~12,000 RU. Each flow channel
has its own reference channel, and blank immobilization using
EDC/NHS and ethanolamine was done for all reference channels. Compound solutions with a series of increasing concentrations (0.049 – 30 µM at 2.5-fold dilution) were applied to
all active and reference channels in SPR binding buffer (10
mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween-20,

0.5 mM TCEP, and 2% DMSO) at a 30 µL/min flow rate at
25 °C. The data were double referenced with a reference
channel and zero concentration (2% DMSO) responses, and
reference subtracted sensorgrams were fitted with 1 to 1 Langmuir kinetic model using a Biacore Insight evaluation software, producing two rate constants (ka and kd). The equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) were determined from two
rate constants (KD = kd/ka). For steady-state affinity fittings,
response units at each concentration were measured during the
equilibration phase, and the KD values were determined by fitting the data to a single rectangular hyperbolic curve equation
(3), where y is the response, ymax is the maximum response and
x is the compound concentration.

Data collection and structure refinement: The glycerol present
in the crystallization solution was sufficient to cryo-protect
crystals, which were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data
were collected at the Life Sciences Collaborative Access
Team beamlines 21-ID-D, 21-ID-G, and 21-ID-F at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Data
indexing and integration were performed using XDS.56 Ellipsoidal truncation and anisotropic scaling were performed by
the UCLA-DOE lab’s Diffraction Anisotropy Server for the
XR824 complex.57 Phases were determined by molecular replacement using Molrep58 and a SARS-CoV-2 PLpro:
GRL0617 complex (PDB entry: 7JRN) as search model. Rigid
body refinement followed by iterative rounds of restrained refinement and model building were performed with CCP4i
modules Refmac559 and Coot.60 The coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with PDB accession codes
7LBR (XR8-89 complex), 7LBS (XR8-24 complex), 7LLF
(XR8-83 complex), 7LLZ (XR8-69 complex), and 7LOS
(XR8-65 complex).
Cell Culture and cytotoxicity: African green monkey kidney
epithelial cells Vero E6 (ATCC# CRL-1586) were cultured in
DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco),
100 units of penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen). Human alveolar epithelial cell line (A549) that stably
express hACE2 are from BEI Resources (NR-53821). They
were grown DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 units of penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen), 1% nonessential amino acids (NEAA)
with 100 µg/mL Blasticidin S. HCl for selection. All cells
were grown at 37 C and 5% CO2. Low passage vero E6 and
A549 cells (5000 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates and
incubated at 37 C and 5% CO2 for 24 hours prior to treatment.
All compounds were dissolved in DMSO and final DMSO
concentrations never exceeded 1%. The cytotoxicity of compounds (100 uM to 1 uM, 3-fold dilution) was examined using
the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay
(Promega). Cell cytotoxicity data was normalized to DMSO
control as 0% cell death.
Antiviral activity assays: Vero E6 cells were seeded 5x105
cells/well in DMEM complete into 12-well plates (1
mL/well). Cells were pretreated with 1.5 μM CP-100356 for
30 min and with both compound + 1.5 μM CP-100356 for 1hour prior to infection. The plaque reduction assay was performed using a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV2, Isolate USA-WA1/2020) from BEI Resources. 2-fold serial
dilutions of compound + CP-100356 were added to the same
volume of SARS-CoV-2 (final MOI = 0.0001), the mixture

was added to the monolayer of Vero E6 cells and incubated
for 1 hour at 37 C and 5% CO2. The mixture was removed,
1 mL of 1.25% (w/v) Avicel-591 in 2X MEM supplied with
4% (v/v) FBS was added onto infected cells with 10X compound + CP-100356. Plates were incubated 48 hours at 37 °C
and 5% CO2. After the 48-hour incubation, the plates were
fixed with 10% (v/v) formaldehyde and stained with 1% (w/v)
crystal violet to visualize the plaques. All experiments were
performed in a Biosafety level 3 facility. EC50 values were
determined by fitting the dose-response curves with four-parameter logistic regression in Prism GraphPad (version 8.1.2).
All data was normalized to virus alone. All error bars represent S.D. from three replicates.
A549-hACE2 cells were seeded 1.5x105 cells/well in DMEM
complete into 24-well plates (0.5 mL/well) then incubated for
16 hours at 37 C and 5% CO2. Cells were pretreated with
compound for 1-hour prior to infection. 2-fold serial dilutions
of compound added to the same volume of SARS-CoV-2 (final MOI = 0.01), the mixture was added to the monolayer cells
and incubated for 1 hour at 37 C and 5% CO2. After, the
mixture was removed and replaced with 0.5 mL of infection
media and incubated at 37 C and 5% CO2. After 48 hours,
supernatants were harvested and processed for RT- qPCR.
RNA Extraction and RT-qPCR: 250 µL of culture fluids
were mixed with 750 µL of TRIzolTM LS Reagent (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). RNA was purified following phase separation by chloroform as recommended by the manufacturer.
