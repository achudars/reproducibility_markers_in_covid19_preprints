ies, as suggested in some early SARS-CoV-2 studies (6, 7).
Solved crystal and cryo-EM structures indicate a relatively
discrete set of neutralising RBD epitopes (possibly resulting
from substantial glycan coverage (8)), with paratopes tending to span both the heavy and light chain complementaritydetermining regions (6, 9–12).
Other SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins also display homology
to more distantly related betacoronaviruses such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
Therefore, knowledge of antibodies that bind to MERS-CoV
antigens could be relevant in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection, and indeed the anti-MERS-CoV combination therapy
REGN3048/REGN3051 is already being trialled on SARSCoV-2 patients in the USA (13).
Given this, a central database facilitating molecularlevel comparisons between published and patented anticoronavirus antibodies would be a valuable tool in the fight
against COVID19. This resource would also act as a central
hub to consolidate knowledge and coordinate efforts to identify novel antibodies that neutralise SARS-CoV-2. As the
number of known binders builds up over time, researchers
could harness this repository for many purposes, including
deriving crucial sequence/structural patterns that distinguish
neutralising from non-neutralising SARS-CoV-2 binders (1),
or deducing independent neutralising epitopes exploitable by
combination therapies.
We have built CoV-AbDab, a new database that aims to document molecular information and metadata on all published
or patented anti-coronavirus antibodies.

The emergence of a novel strain of betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV2, has led to a pandemic that has been associated with hundreds
of thousands of deaths. Research is ongoing around the world to
create vaccines and therapies to minimise rates of disease spread
and mortality. Crucial to these efforts are molecular characterisations of neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Such
antibodies would be valuable for measuring vaccine efficacy,
diagnosing exposure, and developing effective biotherapeutics.
Here, we describe our new database, CoV-AbDab, which already contains data on over 380 published/patented antibodies
and nanobodies known to bind to at least one betacoronavirus.
This database is the first consolidation of antibodies known to
bind SARS-CoV-2 and other betacoronaviruses such as SARSCoV-1 and MERS-CoV. We supply relevant metadata such as
evidence of cross-neutralisation, antibody/nanobody origin, full
variable domain sequence (where available) and germline assignments, epitope region, links to relevant PDB entries, homology models, and source literature. Our preliminary analysis exemplifies a spectrum of potential applications for the
database, including identifying characteristic germline usage
biases in receptor-binding domain antibodies and contextualising the diagnostic value of the SARS-CoV binding CDRH3s
through comparison to over 500 million antibody sequences
from SARS-CoV serologically naive individuals. Community
submissions are invited to ensure CoV-AbDab is efficiently updated with the growing body of data analysing SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
To respond effectively to the recent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, it is
essential to understand the molecular basis for a successful
immune response to coronavirus infection (1). In particular,
characterising the B-cell response is important as the identification of potent neutralising antibodies could pave the way
for effective treatments, aid in prior exposure diagnosis, or
assist in predicting vaccine efficacy (2–5).
Molecular characterisations of binding/neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 antigens are only just beginning to
emerge. However, the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 (the
virus responsible for the 2003 epidemic) spike protein receptor binding domains (RBDs) target the same human receptor and share high sequence and structural homology (2).
As a result, collating data on SARS-CoV-1 binders may
lead to the identification of potent cross-neutralising antibod-

Data Sources
Academic papers and patents containing coronavirus-binding
antibodies were primarily sourced by querying PubMed,
BioRxiv, MedRxiv, GenBank, and Google Patents with relevant search terms. Several review articles were helpful in ensuring maximal coverage, in particular those by Coughlin and
Prabhakar (14), Du et al. (15), Zhou et al. (16), Shanmugaraj
et al. (17), and Jiang et al. (18). If the variable domain sequence was available, ANARCI (19) was used to number sequences in the IMGT (20) numbering scheme, and to assign
V and J gene origins. In some cases we could source germline
assignments and/or CDR3 sequences from the source literature for antibodies where the full Fv sequence was not supplied. Our Structural Antibody Database (21), which tracks
all antibody structures submitted to the Protein Data Bank
(22) (PDB), was mined to identify relevant solved structures.

quence information aligned to human germlines), and derive from a mixture of isolated B-cells from infected or convalescent patients, transgenic mice, or recombinant human
immune or non-immune phage display libraries. We soon
expect the proportion from infected human B cells to increase, as papers characterising and panning the adaptive immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 patients continue to emerge
(24–26). A relatively small portion of antibodies were detected by challenging mice with SARS antigens, and a few
of these were subsequently humanised. All but one SARSCoV binding nanobody was obtained using phage display.
MERS-CoV antibodies followed a similar distribution of origins, but nanobodies were sourced from the B-cells of infected/convalescent camels or immunised llamas (Supplementary Figure 1b).
We also evaluated the distribution of protein targets (and epitope regions, for spike protein binders) for all anti-SARSCoV1/2 (Figure 1b) and anti-MERS-CoV (Supplementary
Figure 1b) antibodies/nanobodies. The spike (S) protein
is known to mediate coronaviral entry into cells through a
biochemical signal initiated by RBD-ACE2 (SARS-CoV) or
RBD-DPP4 (MERS-CoV) binding (65, 71). Therefore, antibodies/nanobodies that can attach to this domain are of particular pharmacological interest, as they may block a crucial
step of the viral reproductive cycle, neutralising the infection.
This bias was strongly reflected in the observed coronavirus
protein targets, with 72.9% of SARS-CoV binders and 58.3%
of MERS-CoV binders attacking the spike protein RBD. A
few other S protein domains were represented, such as the S2
domain and N-Terminal Domain, as well as some binders to
the nucleocapsid and envelope proteins.

CoV-AbDab is an effort to document all coronavirus binding/neutralising antibodies and nanobodies reported in academic publications and commercial patents. Where possible,
the following information is documented for each entry:
1. The published name of the antibody/nanobody
2. Antigens that the antibody/nanobody has been proven to
bind and/or neutralise.
3. The protein domain targeted by the antibody/nanobody
(e.g. spike protein receptor binding domain)
4. The developmental origin of the antibody/nanobody (e.g.
engineered/naturally raised, species information, etc.)
5. Sequence information including: (a) the entire variable
domain sequence for the antibody/nanobody, highlighting the
CDR3 regions, and (b) V and J gene germline assignments.
6. Links to any available structures involving the antibody/nanobody
7. (If Fv sequence available) A homology model of the antibody/nanobody
8. References to the primary literature on the antibody/nanobody
9. Timestamps to show when the antibody/nanobody was
added and last updated
10. Any steps we are taking to follow up on the entry (e.g. to
source its sequence and/or add further metadata)
As of 14th May 2020, CoV-AbDab contains 385 entries
across 46 publications (6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 24–64) and 19 patents.
Of these, 156 entries are associated with MERS-CoV, 149
are associated with SARS-CoV-1, and 105 are associated
with SARS-CoV-2 (each entry may be tested against multiple coronaviruses). It lists 263 unique full variable domain
antibody/nanobody sequences and 56 links to relevant PDB
structures, which include coronavirus spike proteins bound
to their native receptors (35, 65–72). We are continuing to
contact authors to confirm whether missing sequences can
be recovered and added to existing entries. If sequences have
been lost or cannot be released, they have been removed from
the database and confirmed as such in a separate list on the
CoV-AbDab homepage.

Analysis
The following analysis was carried out on the CoV-AbDab
database as of 10th May 2020. For clarity, we use the term
"SARS-CoV-1" to refer specifically to the virus that caused
the 2003 epidemic, and "SARS-CoV" to refer to binders to
SARS coronaviruses in a general sense.
Developmental Origins and Targets. We first analysed

the developmental origins of antibody/nanobody binders to
SARS CoV-1/2 (Figure 1a) and MERS-CoV (Supplementary Figure 1a). The vast majority of the SARS-CoV antibody binders have human genetic origin (88.5% with se2

At the time of writing, sequence information has been released for three antibodies (CR3022, S309, and S315) and

SARS-CoV-2. These all target the RBD, and can crossneutralise SARS-CoV-1.
Genetic Origins. In constructing our database, we evalu-

ated/collected the gene transcript origins of as many of the
anti-SARS-CoV and anti-MERS-CoV antibodies as possible.
Here, we analyse IGHV gene usage, as this transcript encodes
two of the three heavy chain complementarity determining
regions (CDRH1 and CDRH2). Analysis of the CDRH3 region, which lies at the junction of IGHV, IGHD, and IGHJ
genes, is performed in the next section.

ies compromise one of four V genes: IGHV3-30, IGHV1-2,
IGHV3-23, and IGHV1-18. The dominant V gene, IGHV330, was identified in spike protein binders from five independent investigations — Pinto et al. (6), Sui et al.
(34), Hwang et al. (35), and patents WO2008060331A2
and CN1903878A — and is present in around 21% of
RBD binders (monoclonal antibody 80R and its variants are
counted as a single source). IGHV3-30 has been found to be
unusually abundant in several recent B-cell sequencing investigations (26, 74–76). IGHV1-2 (75, 76) and IGHV1-18 (76)
have also been implicated.
In marked contrast to the SARS data, anti-MERS-CoV
RBD antibodies (Figure 2b) are disproportionately (37.2%)
sourced from the IGHV1-69 locus. These antibodies derive
from eight independent investigations — Wang et al. (47),
Niu et al. (48), Chen et al. (51), Ying et al. (60), Jiang et
al. (61), Tang et al. (62), and patents WO2015179535 and

antibodies, and (b) MERS-CoV RBD binding antibodies.

Finally, we evaluated the closest sequence identity match between all SARS-CoV binding CDRH3s and the over 500
million CDRH3s in our Observed Antibody Space (OAS)
database (78). The OAS database is a regularly updated
project to catalogue all publicly available immune repertoire
sequencing experiments (currently over 60 studies), providing cleaned amino acid sequence datasets binned by individual and other useful metadata. We assume that the vast
majority of this sampled population is serologically naive to
SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, given both the high infection rate and that there is currently no evidence to suggest
that exposure to common cold coronaviruses yields SARSCoV cross-reactive antibodies (79). It follows that the presence of CDRH3s shown to bind SARS-CoV but that have
high sequence identity matches to OAS may be less useful
for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Table 1 contains all
CDRH3s for which we obtained 100% identity matches to
a CDRH3 in OAS. A table showing all maximum sequence
identity matches is available as Supplementary File 1 and the
full dataset (with OAS metadata for matches) is available as
Supplementary File 2.

CDRH3 Analysis. We then analysed the CDRH3 regions

D

of anti-SARS-CoV and anti-MERS-CoV antibodies. Overall, we traced 54 distinct SARS-CoV RBD binding antibody CDRH3 sequences and 75 distinct MERS-CoV RBD
binding antibody CDRH3 sequences. The non-redundant
CDRH3 length distributions are shown in Supplementary
Figure 2. SARS-CoV RBD binders are spread between
CDRH3 lengths 8 and 20 (median: 16, mean: 14.87 ± 3.56),
while the CDRH3s of MERS-CoV RBD binders lie between
lengths 5 and 26 (median: 18, mean: 16.17 ± 4.14). The
longer average lengths for MERS-CoV binders are consistent
with the observed IGHV gene distribution, as broadly neutralising IGHV1-69 antibodies tend to have longer CDRH3s
(21).
To see whether RBD binding CDRH3s displayed any sequence biases, we used WebLogo plots (73) to visualise
residue/position distributions (Figure 3). The MERS-CoV
RBD binders displayed slightly higher homology at central
loop positions, but neither showed a strong signal that implicates a particular interaction type. The SARS-CoV RBD
binders have a slight tendency to exploit a poly-tyrosine tail
towards the end of the CDRH3, hinting at a role for the IGHJ6
germline that bears this motif. IGHJ6 was independently implicated in a clone convergent in four of six SARS-CoV-2
patients in the study by Nielsen et al. (26).

Community Contributions

D

We have attempted to identify all existing published information on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV binding antibodies,
however encourage users to inform us of any historical investigations we may have missed. We are also reaching out
to authors of new studies characterising coronavirus binding
antibodies to send us their data in Excel or CSV format. Data
and queries may be sent to us by email (opig@stats.ox.ac.uk).
Minimum requirements for addition to our database are the
full antibody/nanobody variable domain sequence, binding
or neutralising data for at least one specified coronavirus protein, and a link to a relevant preprint, publication, or patent.
Through these submissions and our own efforts to track the
scientific literature, we hope to provide a central community
resource for coronavirus antibody sequence and structural information.

Usage
Currently, the database can be queried by a search term (e.g.
SARS-CoV-2) and ordered by any metadata field for maximum interpretability. Users can download the entire database
as a CSV file and bulk download all ANARCI numberings,
IMGT-numbered PDB files, and IMGT-numbered homology
models.

to be proximal to sequences isolated in the recent Stanford
SARS-CoV-2 patient serum investigation (26). Exact clonal
matches (V gene + high CDRH3 identity) were considerably rarer, implying full clonotyping may need to be performed on SARS-CoV-2 repertoires in order to identify genuine responding antibodies. Conversely, some CDRH3s from
SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies found in SARS-CoV1 (mAb S309 (6)) and SARS-CoV-2 (mAb 32D4 (25)) responding repertoires have considerably lower than average
closest sequence identity matches to OAS (70% and 67% respectively).
