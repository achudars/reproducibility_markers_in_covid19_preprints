Abstract
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged from a city in China and has now spread as a global
pandemic affecting millions of individuals. The causative agent, SARS-CoV-2 is being extensively
studied in terms of its genetic epidemiology using genomic approaches. Andhra Pradesh is one of
the major states of India with the third-largest number of COVID-19 cases with limited understanding
of its genetic epidemiology. In this study, we have sequenced 293 SARS-CoV-2 genome isolates
from Andhra Pradesh with a mean coverage of 13,324X. We identified 564 high-quality SARS-CoV2 variants, out of which 15 are novel. A total of 18 variants mapped to RT-PCR primer/probe sites,
and 4 variants are known to be associated with an increase in infectivity. Phylogenetic analysis of
the genomes revealed the circulating SARS-CoV-2 in Andhra Pradesh majorly clustered under the
clade A2a (94%), while 6% fall under the I/A3i clade, a clade previously defined to be present in
large numbers in India. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive genetic
epidemiological analysis performed for the state of Andhra Pradesh.

Introduction
The emergence of COVID-19 as a global pandemic has necessitated approaches to understand the
emergence and evolution of SARS-CoV-2. Genome sequencing has emerged as one of the widely
used approaches to understand the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-21. The availability of the
complete genome of the pathogen early in the epidemic and subsequent application of genomics on
a global and unprecedented scale has provided an immense opportunity to trace the introduction,
spread and genetic evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 across the globe2.

India is now a major country affected by COVID-19 with over 10 million people affected since the
initial introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the country in 2020 and subsequent introductions through
travellers across major cities. These include states with significantly large populations and air
travellers like Andhra Pradesh which has a population of 49 million people, with an estimated 1.5 to
2 million people who are part of the diaspora spread across the world.
While a number of genomes have been sequenced from different states in India 3, there is a paucity
of genomic data and genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the state of Andhra
Pradesh which motivated us to study the genomes from this state in detail. In the present study, we
report a total of 293 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the state of Andhra Pradesh. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first comprehensive report of the genetic epidemiology and evolution of
SARS-CoV-2 from the state of Andhra Pradesh.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study is in compliance with relevant laws and institutional guidelines and in accordance with the
ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by Institutional Human Ethics
Committee (RC.No.03/IHC/kmcknl/2020, dated 03/08/2020). The patient consent has been waived
by the ethics committee. RNA samples isolated from nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs of
patients from a tertiary care teaching hospital (Kurnool Medical College) were used in the study.
Two protocols for RNA isolation were employed for the clinical samples. The first protocol used
GenoSens (SARS-CoV-2) PCR Viral RNA extraction reagents and samples were processed as per
the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The second protocol involved processing the samples
using the Truprep system (Molbio Diagnostics) for COVID-19. All samples were confirmed by
multiplex RT-PCR (SD Biosensor Healthcare Pvt. Ltd STANDARD M nCoV Real-Time Detection kit,
Meril Diagnostics - Meril COVID-19 one-step RT-PCR Kit, LABSYSTEMS - COVIDsure Multiplex
Real-time RT-PCR kit, See gene Allplex 2019-nCoVAssay detection kit) were selected for the
present study.

A total of 1,43,726 samples were tested between April 21 to 5th August and 10,073 samples were
identified as COVID-19 positive cases. 293 samples were considered for viral genome sequencing
for the present study and were selected between the dates of 27 June to 3 August 2020. Library
preparation and sequencing was performed as per the COVIDSeq protocol (Illumina, USA) as
described in a previous study 4. The samples were sequenced in technical replicates. The raw
binary sequence files in bcl format were demultiplexed and converted to FASTQ files.
We followed a previously published protocol for data analysis5. Briefly, raw FASTQ files underwent
quality control with average Phred score quality of Q30 and read length of 30 bps with adapter
trimming using Trimmomatic (version 0.39) 6. The Wuhan-Hu-1 (NC_045512.2) genome was used
as the reference. Replicate files were independently aligned and merged. Genomes with ≥99%
coverage and ≤5% unassigned nucleotides were processed for variant calls. The variants were
annotated by ANNOVAR

7

using custom database tables for annotating the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

Filtered variants were systematically compared with other viral genomes deposited in the Global
Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) from India and the rest of the world. Genomes from
GISAID were pairwise aligned with the reference genome (NC_045512.2) using EMBOSS

8

and

variants were called using SNP-Sites . Only genomes with an alignment percentage of ≥99% and
9

degenerate bases ≤5% were used for comparative analysis. This accounts for a total of 45,830 highquality genome sequences submitted until 26 September 2020 (Supplementary Table 1).

Phylogenetic analysis was performed as described in a previous protocol using the genomes
sequenced in this study and the dataset of 3,058 genomes from India deposited in the GISAID

. Briefly, the consensus sequences were aligned to the

Wuhan-Hu-1 genome and the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the Augur implementation of
Nextstrain

11,12

. Genomes having ambiguous collection dates or Ns >5% were excluded from the

analysis. The tree was loaded in Auspice for visualisation. Lineages were assigned to the genomes
using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages (PANGOLIN) package 13.

SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants with potential impacts on functional consequences validated through
experimental evidence or by computational predictions were compiled from published studies and
article pre-prints. Variants filtered in this study were compared with this repository to assess their
possible functional impacts. The primer/probe sequences used in the molecular detection of SARSCoV-2 were compiled from the literature and other sources

14

. This compilation included a total of

132 primer and probe sequences. The primer and probe sequences were mapped to the WuhanHu-1 reference genome using BLAST to get their genomic loci. Variants filtered in this study were
mapped to these genomic loci using bespoke scripts.

RESULTS
A 200 µL of VTM (Himedia, Mumbai) with throat swab samples were used to extract the viral RNA
(SD Genomics as manufacturer suggested) from subjects with symptoms of COVID-19 infection. 10
µL of viral RNA was used for RT-PCR detection by using various kits and following the protocol
specified by the manufacturer (SD Biosensor Healthcare Pvt. Ltd STANDARD M nCoV Real-Time
Detection kit, Meril Diagnostics- Meril COVID-19 one-step RT-PCR Kit, LABSYSTEMS - COVIDsure
Multiplex RT-PCR kit, See gene Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay detection kits). Target genes, including
ORF1ab gene, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP gene), Nucleocapsid protein (N gene), and
Envelope protein (E gene) were simultaneously amplified and tested during the real-time PCR
assay. Confirmed SARS-CoV-2 RNA extracts with Ct values 22 to 28 were further processes for
whole-genome sequencing.

A total of 293 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were sequenced which generated an average of 12.7 million
raw reads. After trimming, 11.2 million reads aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome
(NC_045512.2) with a mapping percentage of 97.27% and 13324X coverage (Supplementary Table
3). 276 samples having genome coverage ≥99% and ≤5% unassigned nucleotides were further
processed for variant calling and consensus sequence generation.

The reference-based assembly generated a total of 615 unique genetic variants. To ensure the
reliability of the variant calls only variants with read frequencies ≥50% were considered for the
comparative analysis. 564 such high-quality variants, 544 of which were in protein-coding regions
and 20 were in UTRs. Of the protein-coding variants, 310 variants were non-synonymous, 230 were
synonymous while 4 were stopgain. This analysis also contributed to 15 novel genetic variants
(Supplementary Table 4). The distribution of the variants in the genomes and their annotations are
summarised in Figure 1. 145 variants were annotated as deleterious by SIFT

15

. In addition, a total

of 18 genetic variants mapped to diagnostic RT-PCR primer/probe sites (Supplementary Table 5). A
total of 42 and 421 variants were predicted to map to potential B and T cell epitopes respectively. 11
variants spanning potential homoplasic, hypermutable and sequencing error-prone regions of the
genome were filtered. The detailed annotations of the variants are summarised in Supplementary
Table 6.

Phylogenetics and unique clades and distribution
Phylogenetic analysis was done for the dataset of 3,033 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India including
276 genomes from this study and the genome Wuhan/WH01 (EPI_ISL_406798) as the root. Out of
276 genomes, 260 genomes (94%) clustered under the clade A2a while 16 were under the clade
I/A3i (6%)

16

. The phylogenetic reconstruction of the dataset of Indian genomes and the distribution

of clades is summarized in Figure 2A and B. The dominant lineages for the 276 genomes, as

assigned by PANGOLIN, were B.1.113 (n=129) and B.1 (n=95) as compared to other Indian
genomes where B.1.1.32 and B.6 were dominant while B.1 and B.1.1 lineages were dominant for
genomes in the global dataset. 5 and 1 genomes were assigned the lineages B.1.112 and B.1.104
respectively which have not been previously reported for the genomes from India (Figure 2C).
The two earlier genomes from Andhra Pradesh (EPI_ISL_436440 and EPI_ISL_435089) 17 sampled
in the months of March and April respectively cluster under the clade I/A3i. Genomes from the
neighbouring state of Telangana also show a dominant prevalence of clade I/A3i in the initial days of
the pandemic and an increased representation of clade A2a in later months. The genomes
sequenced in this study show a prevalence of the clade A2a in Andhra Pradesh which suggests a
shift in clade dominance for this region. From the 263 genomes that cluster under clade A2a, a
majority of the genomes (n=171) were seen to fall under a distinct sub-cluster that has been
previously reported for genomes from Gujarat

18

. The cluster is characterized by an S194L

(C28854T) mutation in the nucleocapsid protein of the virus, a mutation which was found to be
significantly associated with disease mortality in Gujarat. One genome from this study (CS0804)
also forms a polytomy with other samples from the neighbouring state of Telangana in the
phylogenetic tree of Indian genomes, which could be suggestive of multiple, simultaneous
divergence events although further data and analysis would be needed to confirm this hypothesis
reliably.

Variants associated with increased infectivity
Potential functional impact of the high-quality variants filtered in the study was identified by precisely
mapping back these variants to a manually curated compilation of functionally relevant SARS-CoV-2
genetic variants. In our analysis, we were able to identify 4 genetic variants in the S gene which
have been reported to be involved in increased infectivity through experimental validation. These
mutations include 23403:A>G (D614G) and three co-occurring mutations 23403A>G+21575C>T
(D614G+L5F), 23403A>G+24368G>T (D614G+D936Y), 23403A>G+24378C>T (D614G+S939F),
having a frequency of 94.20%, 0.725%, 5.435% and 0.362% respectively in the 276 genomes
analysed in this study.

Discussion
Our analysis using the COVIDSeq approach and downstream data analysis has provided detailed
insights into the genetic epidemiology and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 isolates in the state of Andhra
Pradesh. A total of 564 high quality unique genetic variants were identified, out of which 15 variants
are novel. Extensive analysis of the functional consequences of the filtered variants has provided
insights on the impact of these genetic variants in current diagnostic practices.

Phylogenetic analysis of the genomes highlights the potential shift in clade dominance from clade
I/A3i to A2a in Andhra Pradesh, a trend also observed in the neighbouring state of Telangana. The
lineages B.1.112 and B.1.104 were also reported for the first time from Indian genomes.

In conclusion, our study highlights the utility of whole-genome sequencing to study the genetic
landscape and evolution of SARS-CoV-2 isolates in major states like Andhra Pradesh and
emphasises the use of such scalable technologies to gain better and timely insights into epidemics.
