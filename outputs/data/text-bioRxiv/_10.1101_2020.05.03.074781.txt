Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 invades host cells via an endocytic pathway that begins with the interaction of
the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (S-protein) and human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2). Genetic variability in ACE2 may be one factor that mediates the broad-spectrum
severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcomes. We investigated the capacity of
ACE2 variation to influence SARS-CoV-2 infection with a focus on predicting the effect of
missense variants on the ACE2 SARS-CoV-2 S-protein interaction. We validated the mCSMPPI2 variant effect prediction algorithm with 26 published ACE2 mutant SARS-CoV S-protein
binding assays and found it performed well in this closely related system (True Positive Rate
= 0.7, True Negative Rate = 1). Application of mCSM-PPI2 to ACE2 missense variants from
the Genome Aggregation Consortium Database (gnomAD) identified three that are
predicted to strongly inhibit or abolish the S-protein ACE2 interaction altogether
(p.Glu37Lys, p.Gly352Val and p.Asp355Asn) and one that is predicted to promote the
interaction (p.Gly326Glu). The S-protein ACE2 inhibitory variants are expected to confer a

high degree of resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection whilst the S-protein ACE2 affinity
enhancing variant may lead to additional susceptibility and severity. We also performed in
silico saturation mutagenesis of the S-protein ACE2 interface and identified a further 38
potential missense mutations that could strongly inhibit binding and one more that is likely
to enhance binding (Thr27Arg). A conservative estimate places the prevalence of the
strongly protective variants between 12-70 per 100,000 population but there is the
possibility of higher prevalence in local populations or those underrepresented in gnomAD.
The probable interplay between these ACE2 affinity variants and ACE2 expression
polymorphisms is highlighted as well as gender differences in penetrance arising from
ACE2’s situation on the X-chromosome. It is also described how our data can help power
future genetic association studies of COVID-19 phenotypes and how the saturation mutant
predictions can help design a mutant ACE2 with tailored S-protein affinity, which may be an
improvement over a current recombinant ACE2 that is undergoing clinical trial.

1 Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is one of the greatest global health challenges of modern times.
Although the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) is usually cleared following mild symptoms, it can progress to serious disease and
death1. Besides the clear risks associated with age and comorbidities2,3, there could be a
genetic component that predisposes some individuals to worse outcomes4. Identifying
genetic factors of COVID-19 susceptibility has implications for clinical decision making and
population specific epidemic dynamics. Genetic variation may constitute hidden risk factors
and, in some cases, explain why otherwise healthy individuals in low-risk groups experience
severe disease. The identification of specific genetic variants that influence the severity and
progression of COVID-19 presents the opportunity for predictive diagnostics, early
intervention and personalised treatments. The distribution of any genetic risk factors
between populations could give rise to differences in population specific risk levels.
In the absence of GWAS hits for COVID-19 phenotypes, predictions of the effect that
variation might have on the disease are essential. The emerging understanding of SARS-CoV2 infection highlights proteins in which genetic variation could give rise to relevant
phenotypic responses. Databases of human population variation provide a sample of
variation in these proteins, to which we can apply state-of-the-art methods and workflows
for predicting variant effects. A good candidate for variant analysis is a protein with a
defined role in COVID-19 pathogenesis, with potentially functional variants reported in
public databases and that has structural and functional data that can be used to interpret
the potential effects of these variants.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) meets these criteria. ACE2 is the host cell
receptor that SARS-CoV-2 exploits to infect human cells1,5. As this is the same receptor
exploited by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that caused the SARS outbreak in 2002, the
detailed body of knowledge built around SARS-CoV infection is relevant to understanding
SARS-CoV-21,5,6. The spike glycoprotein (S) is the coronavirus entity that recognises and
binds host ACE2. Both SARS coronavirus S-proteins are composed of an S1 domain that
contains ACE2 recognition elements and an S2 domain that is responsible for membrane
fusion5. The protease TMPRSS2 is the host factor that cleaves S into its S1 and S2
subdomains5, in SARS-CoV cleavage is thought to be promoted upon formation of the ACE22

S complex7. The S1 receptor binding domains (RBDs) from both SARS-CoV8 and SARS-CoV-29
have been co-crystallised with human ACE2. The RBDs from both viruses are similar in
overall architecture and both interface with roughly the same surface on ACE2. Differences
are apparent in the so-called receptor binding motif (RBM) of S, which is the region of the
RBD responsible for host range and specificity of coronaviruses8-10. The binding affinity of S
and ACE2 is known explicitly to be correlated to the infectivity of SARS-CoV and is
determined by the complementarity of the interfaces8,10.
In this paper we investigate the capacity of ACE2 variation to influence SARS-CoV-2 infection
with a focus on predicting the effect of missense variants on the ACE2 SARS-CoV-2 S-protein
interaction. The paper is organised as follows: In §2 we present an analysis of the effects of
ACE2 missense variants on S-protein binding. We begin with an overview of missense
variation at the ACE2-S interface from the Genome Aggregation Consortium Database
(gnomAD11) and describe how these variants could modify binding with reference to
structural and mutagenesis studies (§2.1). We then apply the mCSM-PPI212 mutation effect
predictor, which we have extensively validated against published ACE2 mutant SARS-CoV Sprotein affinity assays10 (see Methods), to predict the effect of ACE2 variants from gnomAD
(§2.2) and all possible missense mutations at ACE2-S binding residues (§2.3) on SARS-CoV-2
S-protein binding, and rationalise key results by a structural evaluation of the ACE2 variant
models. In §3 we describe how other coding sequence variants from gnomAD11 might effect
SARS-CoV-2 infection through mechanisms other than modulation of ACE2-S affinity and
identify variants that may be of significance. In §4 we describe how this work could be
applied to the development of an enhanced recombinant ACE2 therapy to treat COVID-19.
Finally, in §5 we discuss the potential impact of ACE2 variants predicted to significantly
affect SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals and populations (§5.1), outline an application of
our work to genetic association analyses (§5.2), address conflicting reports from similar
studies and assess the confidence in our predictions (§5.3), and summarise our main results
and conclusions (§5.4).

2 The effect of ACE2 missense variation on SARS-CoV-2 S binding

Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of gnomAD11 missense and nonsense variants in the
sequence and structure9 of ACE2. In total, there are 338 ACE2 coding variants in gnomAD.
The majority of these are missense variants (241, including 12 in splice regions) and
synonymous variants (90, including 2 in splice regions). Synonymous variants do not alter
the protein sequence and are therefore unlikely to have a functional impact. In general, the
impact of missense variants is dependent on the structural and functional context of the
mutated residue, as well as the physicochemical characteristics of the mutant residue.
Missense variants are found in all the major functional domains of ACE2, including the
peptidase and collectrin domains, the transmembrane region and other functionally
annotated sites (Figure 1). Nonsense variants including stops and frameshifts are also
reported in gnomAD for ACE2. These can have a drastic effect on protein structure and
expression levels, but their effect is less dependent on the residue context than missense
variants. However, there is linear positional dependence since truncations close to the Cterminus are more likely to be tolerated.

2.1 Missense variants and the ACE2-S interface

The simplest way that missense variation could impact SARS-CoV-2 infection would be by
altering the ACE2-S interface. ACE2 missense variants located at residues that bind the Sprotein are most likely to have such effects. Figure 2 illustrates the ACE2-S interface and
highlights residues with reported missense variants in gnomAD whilst Table 1 lists these
variants and their population distribution alongside key structural features of the site. Seven
missense variants occur at residues we classified as directly interacting with SARS-CoV-2 S
(see Methods). All these variants would be considered rare or extremely rare and are mostly
private to a single gnomAD population. There are no homozygous females, but a few males
are hemizygous as indicated. p.Ser19Pro is the most frequently observed ACE2-S interface
variant in gnomAD. Mutations to or from Pro can have severe consequences for protein
structure but as Ser19 is the first observed ACE2 residue in the structure it is difficult to
predict the overall conformational consequence. This variant may be slightly deleterious to
normal ACE2 function given the apparent gender imbalance in its prevalence, but the
significance of this observation with respect to ACE2 activity towards SARS-CoV-2 infection
is unclear. In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the loss of the H-bond donor Ser, which
interacts with a main chain carbonyl on S, could weaken the ACE2-S complex. The next most
common missense variant at the interface is p.Glu37Lys. This variant occurs in an interface
core binding site (see Methods), which have been shown to be less tolerant of mutation
with respect to human pathogenic variants due to disruption of protein-protein
interactions17. Charge inversion mutations have the capacity to be highly disruptive. Glu37
does interact with positively charged residues, but these are intraprotein interactions with
ACE2 Arg393 and Lys353. Nevertheless, the excess positive charge in the variant may
disfavour binding and the Lys will be unable to act as donor in the H-bond with SARS-CoV-2
S Tyr505 suggesting that this variant would be destabilising. Similar considerations hold for
p.Glu35Lys. Glu35 engages with S via an H-bond to Gln493, which will be disrupted by the
variant, but the effect of the charge inversion will be reduced compared to the previous

variant because the neighbourhood of Glu35 includes both positive (Lys31) and negative
(Glu38) charges. The site of p.Glu329Gly is close to the engineered S Arg439. Although it is
not formally engaged in H-bonding or an ionic interaction by ARPEGGIO’s18 definitions, the
residues are likely to interact electrostatically and has been described as an N…O bridge9.
We would therefore expect ACE2 p.Glu329Gly to have reduced affinity with the chimeric
receptor in PDB 6vw1. The wild-type Asn439 will likely be too short to interact with Glu329
and the loss of charge complementarity would probably lead to the same mutation having
no effect with the native SARS-CoV-2 S (see Methods for further details).

in SARS-CoV-2 S binding. Table 2 lists gnomAD missense variants seen at the site of residues
that were previously mutagenized10. Half of the ACE2 mutants listed resulted in inhibition of
S-protein binding but only two mutants correspond exactly to the gnomAD variant and of
these only p.Arg559Ser showed an effect on SARS-CoV S-protein binding. The other mutant
also seen in gnomAD, p.His239Gln, had no reported effect on the interaction. The variant
p.Lys68Glu shares physicochemical properties with the mutant Lys68Asp, which slightly
inhibited interaction with SARS-CoV, and the loss of Pro389 that results from the variant
p.Pro389His also had a slight reduction in binding from a Pro389Ala mutant. The only
variant that is situated at an ACE2-S interacting residue and occurs at a site with a reported
single-point mutant is p.Asp355Asn. The mutant Asp355Ala was reported to reduce ACE2
binding to SARS-CoV S-protein to about 20 % of the wild-type10. This indicates that the site is
important for maintaining the interaction between the proteins.

There are a few caveats to the preceding analyses. The first is that our structural
consideration of variants located at the interface is qualitative. For the variants that we
think would be destabilising, we are unable to say how destabilising they might be and
would have difficulty even ranking them. The second is that we have not ascertained how
far the assay results for SARS-CoV S are applicable to SARS-CoV-2 S. Structural comparison
of the two complexes could help to address this second caveat since ACE2 sites that interact
with S-protein sites that are conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are more likely
to respond in the same way to a mutation than where SARS-CoV-2 has a different residue. A
third flaw is that we have not considered all the reported missense variants. Although
variants located at the interface are most likely to have an effect, residues in proximity to
the interface, but not directly a part of it, could also have an effect. Second and third degree
contacts can have an effect too and even longer range substitution induced conformational
effects cannot be discounted completely (although it has been shown that SARS-CoV S
binding is invariant to ACE2 catalytic conformational changes8,10). In §2.2 we address these
caveats by employing mCSM-PPI212 to predict changes in the ACE2-S binding energy as a
result of the gnomAD variants. We integrate the experimental mutagenesis data by

validating mCSM-PPI2 in this system and calibrating its predictions to the experimental
observations.

2.2 gnomAD variants in ACE2 can significantly modify its affinity with SARS-CoV-2 S
Research into the impact of missense variants at protein-protein interaction interfaces has
led to methods that provide quantitative predictions of the effect of mutations on interface
characteristics12. These predictions are an invaluable addition to insights gained from
inspection of the site and its neighbourhood in the 3D structure. They can also be used to
screen large numbers of variants that would be prohibitively time-consuming to process
through modelling and manual inspection or experimentally. In this section, we predict the
effects of ACE2 missense variation on S-protein binding by the application of the mCSMPPI212 algorithm, which we extensively validated against experimental binding data for 26
ACE2 mutants in complex with the closely related SARS-CoV S (see Methods), and critically
evaluate the key predictions by structural inspection.
Table 3 contains mCSM-PPI2 predictions for nine ACE2 gnomAD missense variants located at
or close to the S-protein interface. On the basis of our mCSM-PPI2 calibration, predicted
ΔΔG > +1.0 kcal/mol is a confident indication that a variant will enhance ACE2-S binding
whilst ΔΔG < −1.0 kcal/mol indicates a mutation that strongly or totally abolishes the ACE2-S
interaction (see Methods). One variant is predicted to enhance binding (p.Gly326Glu) whilst
three variants are predicted to strongly reduce S-protein binding. The remaining five
interface variants are predicted to reduce ΔG over the range −0.2 kcal/mol to −0.6 kcal/mol,
but as they do not exceed the calibrated threshold, we consider these variants as of
uncertain significance with respect to ACE2-S binding.

proteins and forms multiple H-bonding, polar and ionic interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 S
backbone and residues Asn506 and Arg439. These new interactions are strongly suggestive
that the mutant would lead to enhanced binding. However, the relevance of the interaction
with Arg439 is uncertain because this residue was the result of a mutation (Asn439Arg) from
the SARS-CoV-2 S reference (GenBank MN908947.1), engineered to enhance binding
through interaction with ACE2 Glu3299. Modelling p.Gly326Glu in a structure with Asn at
position 439 (6vw1-Asn439, Figure 3C, see Methods) yielded an identical predicted ΔΔG
(i.e., 1.0 kcal/mol). In 6vw1-Asn439, the lost ionic interaction with the mutant Arg is
compensated by an H-bond to the main chain amine of S Val503, which is accessible to a
different rotamer conformation of the mutant Glu residue, whilst retaining the H-bond with
S Asn506. As well as explaining why p.Gly326Glu is still predicted to enhance binding in the
SARS-CoV-2 S model with Asn439, this highlights the sort of interplay that could occur
between ACE2 variants and different SARS-CoV-2 strains. In this example of an engineered
S-protein, the predicted effect on ΔΔG is the same for the ACE2 variant with both S-proteins
but other SARS-CoV-2 S variants could interact differently with ACE2 variation.

gnomAD ACE2 variants p.Asp355Asn, p.Glu37Lys and p.Gly352Val have mCSM-PPI2 ΔΔG <
−1 kcal/mol and we therefore predict that they will significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 S binding
or abolish it altogether. Figure 4 illustrates the structural differences between the wild-type
and mutant structures of these mutants. p.Asp355Asn has the largest predicted negative
ΔΔG of these mutations. Wild-type Asp355 is held in place by an intraprotein ionic
interaction with Arg357. The loss of this charge complementarity in the p.Asp355Asn results
in a different orientation for mutant Asn that introduces a number of clashes between this
residue and others nearby, including the carbonyl oxygen of Thr500 of S. These clashes
might be better accommodated in free ACE2 resulting in reduced affinity for the S-protein.
In p.Glu37Lys, a favourable interprotein H-bond between wild-type Glu37 and RBD Tyr505 is
lost alongside several intraprotein polar and ionic interactions. The new hydrophobic
contact between the mutant Lys37 and the same Tyr residue is likely insufficient to
compensate. p.Gly352Val is the farthest variant from the interface (5.4 Å) that is predicted
to decrease S-protein binding and does not interact directly with any SARS-CoV-2 S residue.
The effect on the interface is through a fourth-degree interaction that terminates with RBD

Tyr505 (i.e., Gly352(C=O)-Tyr41-Lys353-RBD Tyr505). The introduction of Val into a position
occupied by the buried Gly leads to several clashes. A few favourable internal hydrophobic
contacts are also formed, including with Tyr41. The rearrangements necessary to
accommodate Val might affect the bridged interaction between Tyr41 and RBD Tyr505 and
the increased hydrophobic packing coupled with the loss of Gly could affect reduced
flexibility. These considerations support the mCSM-PPI2 prediction.

Mutation of residues on or near the interface are most likely to impact the interaction
affinity but distant mutations can in principle affect interfaces through longer-range
conformational effects. Figure 5 shows the distribution of predicted ΔΔG for 167 gnomAD
ACE2 missense variants in residues resolved in PDB 6vw1. Whilst predicted ΔΔGs are biased
toward a slight destabilising effect overall, the majority of variants have predicted ΔΔGs
between −0.8 kcal/mol and 0.5 kcal/mol, suggesting that most have only a slight effect if
any on ACE2-S binding. This is expected since most variants are away from the ACE2-S
interface (Figure 5C) and distant conformational effects would be relatively rare anyway. In
this case, no additional variants are found with ΔΔG < −1.0 kcal/mol, which is consistent
with experimental evidence that ACE2-S binding is agnostic towards ACE2 conformational
states10. These data also show that variants with predicted ΔΔG in excess of ±1 kcal/mol
outlie the bulk of predictions, providing further empirical support for these thresholds.

There is a second outlier with relatively high positive ΔΔG that is highlighted by the
probability plot (Figure 5B). This is p.Val447Phe with predicted ΔΔG = +0.9 kcal/mol, below
the strict 1 kcal/mol threshold but well in excess of the relaxed threshold that we
considered may be useful for potential ACE2-S affinity enhancing variants (see Methods). If
this variant did lead to enhanced ACE2-S interaction, it could contribute significantly to the
risk burden of ACE2 owing to its prevalence. In gnomAD this variant is observed in 13
individuals across three populations. This result is also unusual because the variant site is
nearly 40Å from the ACE2-S interface. Figure 6 shows the local environment of Val447Phe.

The introduction of the larger Phe residue leads to a few clashes with neighbouring Ile233,
Ile236 and Leu584. However, we were unable to discern a mechanism through which this
mutant could modify ACE2-S binding as the mCSM-PPI2 mutant model showed no changes
at the interface compared to wild-type. However, mCSM-PPI2 may recognise such motion in
its internal model’s “atomic fluctuation” term12. However, in all the mutant models
provided by mCSM-PPI2 we have evaluated, none display any relaxation of the structure,
local or otherwise, in response to the mutant so we are unable to consider this factor in our
critical evaluation. Due to the lack of structural corroboration of the mCSM-PPI2 predicted
ΔΔG, we consider this variant to be of uncertain significance but worthy of follow up in
cohort and experimental studies.

2.3 Exhaustive search for protective and risk factor ACE2 mutations
Existing human variation datasets are well-powered to detect common variation (1KG was
estimated to detect >99% SNPs with MAF >1%21 and gnomAD is substantially larger) but
they are far from comprehensive with respect to rare variation11. Rare variants with a
significant effect on ACE2-S binding could have significant implications for the epidemiology
of COVID-19 in addition to the consequences for affected individuals. If there were 10 such
variants with an allele frequency of 1 in 50,000, their collective occurrence might be as high
as 1 in 5,000 (discounting linkage) and when this is considered alongside the possibility that
a high proportion of the global population will be exposed to SARS-CoV-2 it becomes clear
that such effects should be investigated. In other words, the genetic burden of rare variants
cannot be ignored.
2.3.1 More mutations in ACE2 would reduce ACE2-S affinity than increase it
Figure 7 illustrates the distribution of ΔΔG predictions by mCSM-PPI2 from in silico
saturation mutagenesis of the ACE2-S interface. Most of the 475 possible ACE2 mutations in
residues at the interface with S are predicted to lead to a slight reduction in binding but
there is a secondary mode < −1 kcal/mol containing 125 mutations that are predicted to
lead to strongly reduced ACE2-S binding (Figure 7A). This constitutes a positive prediction
rate of over 25% for inhibitory variants, a figure that is substantially higher than for the
gnomAD variants (≈2%; §2.2) and the validation mutants (14%; Methods) due to the
restriction of the analysis to sites at the ACE2-S interface where mutations are far more

likely to effect the ACE2-S interaction. In contrast, only six mutations are predicted to result
in enhanced binding at the strict ΔΔG threshold of > 1.0 kcal/mol for ACE2-S affinity
enhancing variants and even at the relaxed threshold of > 0.5 kcal/mol only 14 mutations
are highlighted. At face value, these results suggest that there is a good chance that
individuals with ACE2 missense variants at these loci would have an ACE2 variant with
reduced ACE2-S binding whilst ACE2 variants with enhanced affinity for S would be far less
frequent.

Of the 475 possible mutations, the subset of 151 that are accessible via a single base change
from the ACE2 coding sequence are more likely to be observed in the human population.

Figure 7B shows the distribution of predicted ΔΔG for this subset. In this subset, there are
38 substitutions distributed over 12 sites with ΔΔG < −1.0 kcal/mol and a single substitution
with ΔΔG > +1.0 kcal/mol is observed (Thr27Arg). Other factors can be considered too. For
instance, any methylated CpG dinucleotides in the coding sequence would be particularly
variable. This effect is observed at the protein level in the high mutability of Arg residues22.
In ACE2, the only interface residue with a CG dinucleotide is Asp38. The residue is coded by
GAC and the 3rd base is part of a CG dinucleotide. Here the CG to TG mutation leads to a
synonymous change but if we consider that this mutation might recur it is worthwhile
assessing accessible missense changes from this codon, in this case, GAT to GGT (Gly) or GCT
(Ala) are substitutions with ΔΔG < −1 kcal/mol. This approach could be applied to include
other common variant codons such as those from high frequency synonymous variants.
Another factor that might be relevant is the number of degenerate variants that lead to a
given substitution.
This interpretation hinges on mCSM-PPI2 providing predicted ΔΔG that is unbiased. It is
conceivable that mCSM-PPI2 could be biased towards negative ΔΔG predictions because the
training datasets are skewed towards these observations12,23. Fortunately, the mCSM-PPI2
training data were augmented to mitigate this possibility12 and our own analyses of this bias
in the ACE2 SARS-CoV S complex suggests that although the magnitudes of positive
predictions can be depressed, overall the predictions are well-balanced (see Methods). In
addition, some further evidence that mCSM-PPI2 ΔΔG is unbiased comes from the
equivalent distribution of predicted ΔΔG for all possible mutations in SARS-CoV-2 S at sites
that interact directly with ACE2 (Figure 7C). The ΔΔG distribution for these SARS-CoV-2 S
mutations are still skewed towards ΔΔG < 0 kcal/mol but it does not contain the secondary
mode below −1 kcal/mol that we observe in the equivalent ACE2 data (compare Figure 7A
and C). Compared to ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 S also has a few more mutations that are predicted
to enhance ACE2-S binding, including 10 > 1.0 kcal/mol out of 22 > 0.5 kcal/mol.
2.3.2 A missense variant causing Thr27Arg would enhance ACE2-S affinity
We noted that one of the ACE2 mutations predicted to enhance ACE2-S binding was
accessible from a single base change. This was Thr27Arg, which constitutes a second
potential risk factor variant and deserves further evaluation. Thr27Arg is accessible from the
C>G transversion in the wild-type codon ACA results in the AGA codon for Arg. Thr27Arg has
the largest predicted ΔΔG of all the ACE2 binding-site mutants tested (1.4 kcal/mol) and is
an apparent outlier amongst the full set of ACE2 saturation mutants (Figure 7A). Figure 8
illustrates the structural differences between the mutant and reference residue. Thr27
makes no specific contacts with SARS-CoV-2 S, coming closest to S Tyr489 (4.3 Å). Thr27Arg
is amply accommodated in the interface. The guanidium interacts with S Tyr421 and Tyr473
whilst the charge is neutralised by nearby ACE2 Asp30. The guanidium fills a space between
S Tyr473 and ACE2 Glu23 at the rim of the interface (behind the plane of Figure 8). The
additional positive charge is neutralised by interaction with ACE2 Asp30. These features of
Thr27Arg are strongly supportive of its potential to enhance ACE2-S binding.

3 Other ACE2 variants and SARS-CoV-2 viral susceptibility
3.1 Missense variants in ADAM17 and TMPRSS2 cleavage regions
ACE2 can be cleaved by TMPRSS2 and ADAM17 and it has been shown that cleavage by
TMPRSS2 enhances SARS-CoV cell entry7. Missense variants in the ADAM17 and TMPRSS2
cleavage regions (Table 4 and Figure 1) may affect the ratio of these ACE2 cleavage
processes and consequently the availability of the TMPRSS2 ACE2 cleavage S-driven
augmented entry pathway7. If this pathway were to prove active in SARS-CoV-2, then we
could expect variants that disrupt ADAM17 cleavage to enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection whilst
variants that disrupt TMPRSS2 might be protective. Mutations of Arg and Lys residues in the
TMPRSS2 (R697-R716) and ADAM17 (R652-K659) cleavage regions can abolish ACE2
processing by these enzymes7. There are five Arg substitutions in the TMPRSS2 cleavage
region that could reduce TMPRSS2 processing of ACE2 and consequently confer some level
of resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection, whilst the gain of Arg mutation p.Ser709Arg could
lead to increased susceptibility by increasing TMPRSS2 processing. p.Arg697Gly is
particularly notable given its prevalence and apparent specificity to South Asian males
(Table 4). ADAM17 contains one Arg missense in gnomAD but since the variant leads to a
Lys its effect in this respect is most likely neutral.

3.2 Nonsense variants in ACE2
A few nonsense variants with potentially severe consequences for the canonical ACE2
transcript are present in gnomAD (Table 5). There are three stop-gained variants, two
frameshift variants and a start-lost variant. Each of these variants would have a severe
impact on the protein through the translation of a truncated and aberrant product or
nonsense mediated decay. It is possible that stop-gained p.Leu656Ter and frameshifting
p.Lys702ArgTer16 could lead to a semi functional product since they allow translation of a
complete peptidase domain but the relevance to SARS-CoV-2 entry is unclear. An inframe
deletion variant that results in the deletion of Lys313 occurs in a single male in the nonFinnish European cohort. It is difficult to interpret the effect of this variant as it could alter
the pattern of exposed residues on the helix in which it occurs. However, we think it likely
that it would be structurally accommodated, particularly since the closest loop begins only a
few residues away at Gly319 (Figure 1). Crucially, Lys313 is about 20 Å from the SARS-CoV-2
RBD so we do not expect it to impact ACE2-S formation.

4 Therapeutic applications

ACE2 has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for COVID-1924. One idea is to
disrupt the ACE2-S interface with small-molecule or peptide inhibitors. The descriptions of
the ACE2 variants provided here can help to anticipate possible pharmacogenomic effects of
variants located at the ACE2-S interface. Another promising treatment direction is the
administration of recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2)24,25. This might compete with
endogenous ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 S. The approach has been proved-in-principle through the
inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infections in engineered human tissue models25 and a clinical trial
is now underway (EudraCT Number: 2020-001172-15). An earlier trial was registered
(Clinicaltrials.gov #NCT04287686)24 but has since been withdrawn before enrolling
participants. The affinity of the administered rhACE2 might be a crucial component of the
treatments efficacy, as indicated by the fact that mouse ACE2 did not have the same effect
as human ACE225. We will now describe how the ACE2-S interface saturation mutagenesis
data can be used to design mutant ACE2 with tailored SARS-CoV-2 S affinity.

4.1 Design of therapeutic recombinant ACE2 with tailored affinity for SARS-CoV-2 S
In addition to predicting the effects of missense variants, the mCSM-PPI2 saturation
mutagenesis data can be used to select substitutions in ACE2 that are likely to lead to
reduced or enhanced affinity towards SARS-CoV-2 S. An ACE2 mutant with enhanced S
affinity might be desirable for rhACE2 therapy. Even slightly enhanced affinity over
endogenous ACE2 might shift the equilibrium towards rhACE2-S-protein complex formation

and reduce the dose required for inhibition of viral infection. Table 6 presents the top
mutations from the set of mutants predicted to lead to the largest increase in ΔΔG per site.
These mutations are excellent candidates to improve the efficacy of rhACE2 therapy in
COVID-19. We draw special attention to Gly326Glu, which corresponds to one of the
gnomAD missense variants discussed earlier (see §2.2.1) and may be an excellent candidate
since native ACE2 activity is likely to be maintained given that the variant is observed in a
population dataset. The full dataset is provided in Supplementary Data File 1.

There are other criteria that should be considered to minimise the chance of disrupting the
native activity of ACE2, which is thought could mitigate COVID-19 lung pathologies in
addition to viral inhibition24. Basic considerations such as avoiding mutations to or from
proline or glycine and nuanced strategies such as restricting candidates to sites with known
population variants are relevant. The former criterion might be ignored if a major
physicochemical change is deemed necessary to enhance S affinity. Whether or not this
interface has any endogenous role will underlie tolerance of native ACE2 activity to
mutations.
The utility of an ACE2 variant with enhanced ACE2-S binding as a competitive inhibitor of
endogenous ACE2 is clear, but since our data could be used to guide the design of a variant
with depressed binding, we can consider if this might be of any use. Assuming that rhACE2
therapy works by competing with membrane bound native ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 S (rhACE2
efficacy in acute respiratory distress syndrome is thought to be due to circulating ACE2
activity26, i.e. it does not enter the cell), an ACE2 mutant with reduced affinity for SARS-CoV2 could be beneficial if it replaced native ACE2 on the membrane. This could be useful if
gene therapy were practical or desirable for this disease.
As far as we know, the clinical trial assessing the efficacy of rhACE2 therapy in COVID-19
uses recombinantly expressed wild-type cleaved ACE225. Clinical testing and approval can be
expediated for repurposed existing therapies as is clearly the strategy here. Our proposal to
for enhanced rhACE2 could in principle be achieved with a single mutation and might be
suitable for delivery within a similar rapid development framework.

5 Discussion and conclusion
5.1 The impact and prevalence of ACE2 variant receptor activity genotypes
How far could ACE2-S affinity modulation variants effect SARS-CoV-2 infection? There is
clear evidence that mutations in ACE2 that effect its affinity for coronavirus S-protein could
provide complete protection from infection. This can be understood from the host range
specificity of coronaviruses driven by ACE2-S complementarity alongside mutagenesis
studies showing that controlled single point mutations can abolish interaction10. In SARSCoV-2, it has been shown that the APN and DDP4 cell entry pathways are not active1,5, so
there can be no recourse to these routes (unless mutations in these genes could establish
this activity). In this work, some observed ACE2 variants were predicted to have a
comparable effect on ACE2-S binding as mutants that were experimentally determined to
abolish the interaction altogether. Therefore, it is possible that individuals carry ACE2
variants that confer resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection. If infection efficiency operates on a
continuous scale, perhaps to some extent proportional to the binding affinity, then various
gradations of resistance could be conferred by different variants.
It is less clear what effect the ACE2-S binding enhancer variants might have. In principle,
they could increase susceptibility to infection by promoting SARS-CoV-2 cellular attachment,
potentially reducing the infective dose of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 variants with enhanced
receptor activity could also promote infection of cell types that express lower levels of
ACE2, and so lead to increased risk of COVID-19 complications (e.g., acute renal failure)
since viral spreading is associated with clinical deterioration27. Such effects might also lead
to increased transmission from individuals with ACE2-S enhancing variants. It was suggested
that enhanced ACE2-S affinity in SARS-CoV-2 versus SARS-CoV could lead to increased
infection in the upper respiratory tract5, this hypothesis is beginning to bear out with
evidence of upper respiratory tract infection28 and higher ACE2 affinity of SARS-CoV-2
compared to SARS-CoV now established9. However, there is also the possibility that such
variants are protective, if for instance the ACE2 variant led to a persistent stable ACE2-S
complex that interfered with S proteolysis, although to our knowledge this phenomenon has
not been observed. Experimental work-up of the Thr27Arg and Gly326Glu variants of ACE2
should provide answers to these questions.
Aside from ACE2-S affinity, host cell ACE2 expression levels are known to be important for
the cellular specificity of SARS-CoV29 and attention has been directed toward ACE2
expression levels as a potential factor in COVID-19 susceptibility and severity30. It is helpful
to consider that with respect to SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, the physical mechanism underlying
the effects of variation in ACE2 expression and ACE2 variant S-protein affinity is the
formation of the ACE2-S complex. In a simplistic model, ACE2 expression modifies ACE2
membrane concentration whilst ACE2-S affinity modifies the equilibrium dissociation
constant. It is conceivable then that affinity variants and expression variants compound the
effect of one another, in a manner akin to that suggested for ACE2 variants and ACE2
stimulating drugs30, and so ACE2 haplotypes and linkage with other regulatory loci could be
critical. This also has implications for more moderate ACE2-S affinity modifying variants,
since their effect could be amplified in the presence of altered ACE2 expression.
Other epidemiological features can be reconciled with our observations. For instance, males
are significantly more likely to die as a result of COVID-19 infection. Since ACE2 resides on

the X chromosome, female heterozygotes will express a proportion of ACE2 alleles whilst
males are hemizygotes and carry only a single ACE2 allele (this was also noted by Asselta et
al.31 who also noted that ACE2 escapes complete X-inactivation). A male carrying a rare
ACE2-S affinity enhancing variant will be worse affected than a female heterozygote.
Moreover, it is conceivable that in females the more resistant ACE2 allele could rapidly
become predominant in infected tissues due to selection induced by host cell turnover over
infection cycles, gradually increasing the expression of the S-protein resistant ACE2 allele if
present. In addition to the benefits of this selection process, this may have implications for
female survivors of COVID-19 depending on the persistence X-inactivation bias and the
nature of the hitchhiking alleles.
Although, as described above, there is clear evidence that missense variants are capable of
abolishing ACE2’s receptor activity towards SARS-CoV-2 S, it is complicated to estimate the
prevalence of such variants in the population. The gnomAD variants predicted to reduce
ACE2-S binding are all very rare. p.Glu37Lys is the most prevalent with an allele frequency
(AF) 0.0003 in the gnomAD Finnish samples and it is also observed in one African/African
American sample. The two other gnomAD inhibitory variants p.Gly352Val and p.Asp355Asn
are both doubletons observed only in non-Finnish Europeans, each corresponding to AF =
0.00003 in this population. Expanding on this, a simple estimation is that these two variants
might confer SARS-CoV-2 resistance to just over 1 in 15,000 non-Finnish Europeans,
comparable to many rare diseases. However, these are not the only potentially protective
ACE2 variants. Our analysis of the effects of all possible missense mutations at the ACE2-S
interface predicted that 38 substitutions accessible via single base changes at 12 sites would
lead to severely reduced interaction. These substitutions account for 41 missense variants
out of the possible 108 single nucleotide variants at the codons corresponding to the ACE2
residues that bind SARS-CoV-2 S. A crude upper bound under the highly conservative
assumption that these variants occur at lower frequencies than the allele frequency of a
singleton can be calculated. The minimum possible AF for a singleton in gnomAD nonFinnish Europeans is 8.8 × 10-6. Since we are calculating the effect of 41 unobserved
variants, their joint frequency (assuming no linkage) is 3.6 × 10-4, which is equivalent to 72
variants per 200,000 alleles or 7.2 per 10,000 population. A more sophisticated estimate
takes account of the empirical detection of rare variants in ACE2. For example, there are
1,181 variant alleles in 56,885 non-Finnish Europeans arising from variants with AF < 0.01 in
the 2,415 nucleotide ACE2 coding sequence (n.b. at this AF threshold, 90 % are missense).
This amounts to a variation rate of about 4.3 × 10-6 per nucleotide per allele. So, at the 12
sites (36 nucleotides) with variants predicted to strongly reduce ACE2-S binding we could
roughly expect 1.6 × 10-4 variants per allele or 31 variants per 100,000 population. This is
another conservative estimate for these sites since surface residues tend to be more
variable than the core or other functional regions of the protein32. Finally, since 41 out of
108 possible SNPs at these 12 sites are predicted to lead to a strongly reduced ACE2-S
interaction, we can multiply by this proportion to estimate the number that might strongly
reduce ACE2-S binding. This yields an estimate that 11.8 individuals per 100,000 population
possess an ACE2 allele that is predicted to be resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Although these rough estimates suggest that highly resistant ACE2 alleles are extremely rare
it is important to note that allele frequencies show significant variation even between large
variation datasets33. Moreover, it is known that local population allele frequencies also vary

substantially from those reported in public datasets34 and it is therefore possible that some
populations have resistance mutations at higher frequencies. Also, we have only considered
ACE2 variants that are predicted to result in a strong reduction or total abolition of ACE2-S
binding. Our data also suggests that ACE2 interface mutants tend to at least slightly reduce
ACE2-S binding and this means that there will be a higher prevalence of ACE2 alleles with
this property. In concert with altered ACE2 expression levels, these moderate ACE2-S
affinity variants could have a larger effect at the population scale.

5.2 Applications to population genetic analyses of ACE2 variation in COVID-19
Another approach to assess the role of ACE2 variation in COVID-19 has been the application
of comparative population genetic analysis. Two reports have found polymorphisms in ACE2
expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) vary between populations but both concluded there
was no clear evidence regarding ACE2 missense variants4,31. Why did neither of these
studies find evidence that ACE2 missense variants could be associated with variable
population specific epidemiology? First, Rosanna et al.31 acknowledge that there is no
conclusive evidence that apparent cross-population differences in COVID-19 epidemiology
are not accounted for by population demography31, which raises the possibility that
population differences in allele frequencies and burden are meaningless in the context of
COVID-19 genetics. Nevertheless, the detection of decreased TMPRSS2 burden in Italians
and Europeans compared to East Asians31 showed that the approach could turn up
interesting results with rational mechanistic interpretations. A potential prejudice against
the resolution of COVID-19 genetic association with ACE2, and one that highlights an
application of our work, is the inclusion criteria for variants in burden tests. Standard
filtering strategies based on predicted variant severity may have worked well for TMPRSS2
where SARS-CoV-2 exploits its native catalytic function5, but ACE2 mediated SARS-CoV-2 cell
entry does not require ACE2 catalytic activity10 and as a result these filters might be
counterproductive. Inclusion criteria for missense variants might be better based on their
predicted effect on S-protein affinity, differentiating variants predicted to reduce ACE2-S
affinity from those that enhance it since they may have opposite effects (Table 3), or
potential to mitigate some other SARS-CoV-2 infection pathway such as TMPRSS2 or
ADAM17 cleavage region variants (Table 4). Moreover, it might be useful to test missense
variants with specific effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection separately, to isolate these features
from the other roles ACE2 may have in COVID-19 pathology. This application to burden tests
would likely prove useful to attempts to determine host genetic factors that influence
COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.

5.3 Reconciling conflicting results from closely related studies
Two studies applied computational methods to gnomAD variants at the ACE2-S interface
and report conflicting conclusions to our own35,36. Hussain et al.35 employed homology
modelling, pathogenicity predictions and the PRODIGY37 webserver to assess 17 gnomAD
ACE2 variants located at the S interface or at reported mutagenesis sites, all of which were
considered in our work, including variants p.Asp355Asn, p.Glu37Lys and p.Gly352Val that
we find are likely to strongly inhibit ACE2-S binding (Table 3). They tentatively suggested
that p.S19P and p.E329G might be resistant to S-protein attachment, which partially
conflicts with our conclusion that these variants are unlikely to significantly effect ACE2-S
binding (Table 3), and they did not predict a significant reduction in ACE2-S binding in the
p.Asp355Asn, p.Glu37Lys and p.Gly352Val variants. In a different study, Othman et al.36
19

assessed eight gnomAD ACE2 variants at the interface. Their variant models were derived
from homology models built from SARS-CoV S bound to human-civet chimeric ACE2 (PDB ID:
3scl) and they also used PRODIGY37 in addition to another predictor to calculate ΔΔG. After
finding no variants exceeded a predefined 1 kcal/mol threshold they concluded that this
meant there was little chance of ACE2 mediated resistance to SARS-CoV-2. Amongst the
eight variants tested in Othman et al.36 were the three variants we predict will strongly
disrupt ACE2-S binding and p.Gly326Glu, which we find enhances ACE2-S binding.
Although these negative findings conflict with our work, we remain confident in our results
for a few reasons. First, we point to our validation data on mCSM-PPI2, which demonstrates
its effectiveness in the highly similar SARS-CoV S-protein ACE2 complex (see Methods), and
we report that PRODIGY, which was employed by both other studies, did not perform as
well on this validation set (Supplementary Figure 2). Another factor that could contribute to
the different results is that the other studies derived variant models from different
structures of ACE2-S than we have (i.e., PDBs 6lzg38, and 3scl). We found mCSM-PPI2
predictions from PDBs 6vw19 and 6lzg38 to be highly concordant for the same interface
mutations (ρ = 0.97; see also Supplementary Figure 3) confirming that structure selection
was not an issue.
With respect to p.Ser19Pro and p.Glu329Gly, which Hussain et al.35 predicted might be
resistant to S-protein attachment on the basis of PRODIGY predicted ΔG and the presence of
fewer charge interactions in the p.Glu329Gly model and other lost contacts. An interesting
rationale given for these results was that the interaction between ACE2 Lys353 and the Sprotein, a site shown to be important for binding SARS-CoV S-protein10, was lost in their
models of p.Ser19Pro and p.Glu329Gly but it is unclear how confident this movement is
given that Lys353 is about 30 Å and 16 Å away from the variant sites, respectively. In our
results, p.Ser19Pro had the smallest predicted ΔΔG (−0.2 kcal/mol) of any of the gnomAD
interface variants whilst p.Glu329Gly had the third smallest (−0.4 kcal/mol; Table 3). These
values are well below our calibrated 1.0 kcal/mol threshold, but we do recognise the
possibility they could be false negatives or could weakly inhibit ACE2-S binding. However,
we observed nothing in these sites’ local environments that suggests the variant residues
would strongly affect ACE2-S association (§2 and Supplementary Table 1) and since Hussain
et al.35 refer to distant structural changes to explain the result we think that the mCSM-PPI2
result for these variants is more structurally realistic.
The difference between our conclusions and these reports highlights the uncertainty
inherent in prediction methods and the variability in predictions from different algorithms
and models, but we are confident that the results presented in our work are strongly
justified. The mCSM-PPI2 prediction algorithm was designed specifically for the task in hand,
to predict changes in protein binding affinities upon mutation, and displays best-in-class
performance according to community best-practice benchmarks12. Our validation of mCSMPPI2 with experimental data from the closely related SARS-CoV S-ACE2 complex provides
direct evidence that this algorithm yields accurate predictions for this complex and
calibrates the algorithm’s quantitative predictions with observed physical behaviour
(Methods). Additionally, we have followed up key results with a critical structural inspection
of the local environments of the mutant models and in our judgement the predictions are in

line with the principles established by the original structural and mutagenesis work in this
area8,10.

5.4 Conclusion
In summary, we have assessed the potential of ACE2 genetic variation to impact SARS-CoV-2
infection, primarily through prediction of ACE2-S binding efficiency, but also with respect to
the potential ACE2 TMPRSS2 cleavage driven augmented entry pathway. Our results are
based largely on predictions from the state-of-the-art mCSM-PPI212 mutation effect
predictor for protein-protein complex affinity, but we first validated this method against
published experimental ACE2 mutant SARS-CoV S-protein affinities10 and demonstrated its
applicability to this system and calibrated the quantitative predictions to physical
observations (see Methods). We found a single known variant in the gnomAD11,
p.Gly326Glu, that we predict enhances ACE2 binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2 S that is
therefore a potential risk factor for COVID-19. We found three variants in gnomAD that are
predicted to reduce ACE2 affinity towards S, p.Glu37Lys, p.Gly352Val and p.Asp355Asn, that
are therefore potentially protective against COVID-19. The models that underlie these
predictions were structurally evaluated and we judged the predictions to be in line with the
established principles concerning ACE2 receptor recognition by coronavirus S-proteins8-10,39.
We extended our predictions to all possible ACE2 missense variants that interact with SARSCoV-2 S. We found that mutations that lead to reduced ACE2-S interaction affinity are far
more likely than mutations that lead to increased interaction. Simple estimates of the
prevalence of ACE2 resistance conveying alleles suggest that the most protective alleles will
be very rare (12-70 per 100,000 population) and potential risk factors will be rarer but the
possibility of higher prevalence in local or underrepresented populations remains. Also,
weaker effects, which are more common, could be amplified by ACE2 expression
polymorphisms. This is consistent with the high rate of asymptomatic and mild infections
and the rarity of severe disease in low-risk groups. A further candidate risk factor variant
was identified in this analysis, Thr27Arg. Finally, we described how the mCSM-PPI2
predicted mutant affinities could be used to enhance the potency of a recombinant ACE2
therapy that is currently undergoing clinical trial24,25 in COVID-19. This work has clear
applications in helping to prioritise experimental work into SARS-CoV-2 S-protein human
ACE2 recognition; developing genetic diagnostic risk profiling for COVID-19 susceptibility
and severity; improving detection and interpretation in future COVID-19 genetic association
studies and in developing therapeutic agents for COVID-19.

Methods
Integration of structure, variant and mutagenesis data
We conducted an initial scoping analysis of ACE2 in Jalview 2.1114. The ACE2 protein
sequence was retrieved from UniProt13 and the structure of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein bound
ACE2 (PDB ID: 6vw1) was mapped to this sequence with Jalview’s built-in structure mapping
capability. The structure was visualised in a Jalview14 linked UCSF Chimera16 session.
Contacts between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 S-protein were identified with the Chimera
FindClash command with default settings for contacts, and Van der Waals overlaps were
stored as attributes. The average overlap per residue was pulled into Jalview as features
from Chimera with the Fetch Chimera attributes function. This allowed UniProt features
(e.g., mutagenesis, SARS-CoV binding, TMPRSS2 cleavage site) to be interactively inspected

alongside the residue S-protein contacts and gnomAD variants loaded from a Jalview
feature file (Supplementary Figure 1; see below).
The pyDRSASP suite15 was used to integrate 3D structure, population variant and
mutagenesis assay data for analysis. Population variants from gnomAD were mapped to
ACE2 with VarAlign15. Residue mappings were derived from the Ensembl VEP annotations
present in the gnomAD VCF. In addition, we manually checked the gnomAD multi nucleotide
polymorphisms (MNPs) data file and found no records for ACE2.
ACE2 mutagenesis annotations were retrieved from UniProt with ProteoFAV15. Li et al.10 is
indicated as the source for all SARS-CoV Spike-ACE2 mutagenesis annotations. The
UniProt/Swiss-Prot annotations included a qualitative description of the effect of each
mutant. These descriptions were parsed into terms and represented with ordinal categories:
Abolishes interaction > Strongly inhibits > Inhibits > Slightly inhibits > No effect. Quantitative
results were extracted from figures in Li et al.10 with WebPlotDigitizer 4.240. We validated
the data transcription by comparing the tabulated values with the UniProt qualitative
annotations (Supplementary Figure 4). We transcribed data for additional mutants from Li
et al.10 that were not reported in UniProt.
Structural data were retrieved with ProIntVar15. The structure of chimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike
receptor binding domain in complex with human ACE2 (PDB ID: 6vw1)9 was downloaded
from PDBe. Residue-residue contacts were calculated with ARPEGGIO18. ACE2-S interface
residues were defined as those with any interprotein interatomic contact (Supplementary
Table 1). The asymmetric unit contains two ACE2-S-protein dimers. 68 residue contact pairs
were observed in both complexes in the asymmetric unit, 6 were unique to complex A-E and
4 were unique to complex B-F. Although the complex between chain A ACE2 and chain E
SARS-CoV-2 S is assigned as the most probable biological unit by RCSB and PDBe, for the
purposes of completeness, we counted all contacts in both complexes as the ACE2-S
interface. Interface contact numbers are defined as the number of residues on the partner
protein a residue is in contact with (i.e., we do not count intraprotein contacts). For
example, ACE2 S19 contacts SARS-CoV-2 S residues Ala475, Gly476 and Ser477 so its
interface contact number is three. Solvent accessibility was calculated with DSSP41 for the
intact complex and each individual PDB chain (corresponding to monomeric ACE2 and SARSCoV-2 S) and relative solvent accessibilities (RSA) were derived using the maximal allowed
residue accessibility42. Interface residues were classed as Core or Rim as suggested by David
and Sternberg17 on the basis of differences between RSA of the complex and free
monomers. UniProt-PDB mappings were retrieved from SIFTS43.

Prediction of missense variant effects on S-protein – ACE2 interaction
The mCSM-PPI212 web server was used to predict the effect of mutations on the SARS-CoV-2
Spike-ACE2 interface topology and binding affinity with the structure PDB ID: 6vw19. ACE2
gnomAD variants were supplied to the web server via upload of a mutation list to the
Predictions interface. Wild-type and mutant interaction graphs were inspected online with
the Single-Point Mutation interface. The wild-type and mutant models were downloaded
from the server as PyMol sessions and detailed structural comparisons were conducted with
PyMol20. Our typical workflow was to group all the objects in each session (i.e., wild-type
and mutant) and then load both models and contact descriptor objects into a single PyMol

session. The models within the mCSM-PPI2 PyMol sessions did not retain their original
numbering and it was necessary to reload the original PDB 6vw1 model to identify residues
conveniently.
Most of the saturation mutagenesis data were obtained by selecting the Saturation
Mutagenesis option on the Interface Analysis submission page. In this analysis, the mCSMPPI2 web server defines the interaction interface automatically. No residue farther than 5 Å
from the interface site, as defined by the web server, was included in the analysis.
Saturation mutagenesis data for positions Gly326 and Glu352, which were beyond this limit
but found in our study to harbour ACE2-S affinity altering variants, were obtained via the
mutation list submission. Data were downloaded in CSV format. n.b. The mCSM-PPI2 model
for p.Gly352Tyr displayed a chemically invalid conformation for the mutant Tyr and so
results for this mutant were excluded.
mCSM-PPI2 predictions for mutations corresponding to the ACE2 single-point mutants with
experimental data10 on SARS-CoV Spike-ACE2 binding were obtained with the structure of
SARS-CoV S receptor binding domain complexed with human ACE2 (PDB ID: 2ajf)8 as starting
model. These results were merged with the experimental binding assay data, collected as
outlined above.
mCSM-PPI2 predictions were obtained for models with the engineered Arg439 substituted
with the native Asn. Arg439Asn was modelled with mCSM-PPI2 on the structure 6vw1. The
model was exported to PDB from the PyMol session downloaded from the mCSM-PPI2
results page. This model was provided as the starting structure for mCSM-PPI2 predictions.
mCSM-PPI2 predictions for the validation reverse mutations were obtained in the same
way.
Validating mCSM-PPI2 Spike-ACE2 ΔΔG predictions on SARS-CoV S-protein data
mCSM-PPI212 is a random forest family predictor that models mutations with graph based
signatures and other descriptors trained on protein-protein binding affinities from the
SKEMPI 2.0 database23. mCSM-PPI2 predicts the change in the Gibbs free energy of the
complex as a result of point mutations (ΔΔG). Negative ΔΔG means that the mutation is
predicted to decrease the binding affinity whilst positive ΔΔG predicts an increase in affinity.
mCSM-PPI2 achieved an average Pearson’s correlation (ρ) of 0.82 and root mean square
error (RMSE) of 1.18 kcal/mol during 10-fold cross-validation and ranked first out of 26
others on the CAPRI44 community standard benchmark. A better representative of the
predictor’s generality to different complexes is the cross-validation results on a training set
with low redundancy of complexes. This gave ρ = 0.75 and RMSE = 1.30 kcal/mol. This
behaviour is typical for machine learning methods where performance is best in systems
closer to the training data. The method was also evaluated on a set of 378 alanine scanning
mutations across 19 protein complexes and this resulted in exceptional cross-validation
metrics ρ = 0.95 and RMSE = 0.25 kcal/mol, which can be interpreted as an indication of the
consistency of the method for different mutations within complexes
Experimentally determined SARS-CoV S-protein affinities are available for several ACE2
mutants10. These mutants present the opportunity to validate mCSM-PPI2 predictions on a
system closely related to SARS-CoV-2 S-protein interactions. If mCSM-PPI2 can be shown to

perform well here, then we expect good performance for SARS-CoV-2 S-protein affinities,
potentially approaching the accuracy displayed in the evaluation of the alanine scan dataset.
Methods Figure 1A illustrates the performance of mCSM-PPI2 ΔΔG as a predictor for the
experimentally determined S-protein interactions. The experimental affinities are positively
correlated with predicted ΔΔG (ρ = 0.68) so that mutants in ACE2 that strongly reduced or
abolished SARS-CoV S interaction (S-) tend to have lower predicted ΔΔG than mutants with
little or no effect on the interaction (S+). In detail, five of the seven S- mutations have
predicted ΔΔG between -2 and −1 kcal/mol whilst most S+ mutations have predicted ΔΔG >
−0.5 kcal/mol. The remaining two S- mutants, Lys31Asp and Lys353His, received ΔΔG
predictions > −0.5 kcal/mol, which is within the range displayed by the bulk of S+ mutants.
Two S+ mutants received slightly lower ΔΔG predictions than most other S+ mutants, but
still well above −1 kcal/mol. These results suggest that ΔΔG < −1.0 kcal/mol yields a
confident prediction that the mutation strongly inhibits or abolishes ACE2-S interaction
(rule-in threshold) whilst ΔΔG > −0.5 kcal/mol is indicative that the mutation has little to no
effect on the interaction (rule-out threshold). ΔΔG predictions between these limits are
relatively sparse but S+ mutations received predicted ΔΔG as low as −0.73 kcal/mol whilst
the first inhibitory mutant had predicted ΔΔG −1.17 kcal/mol. Table 7 shows the
concordance between the experimental result and the mCSM-PPI2 prediction setting a
prediction threshold at ΔΔG < −1.0 kcal/mol. At this threshold, no S+ mutants are falsely
predicted to abolish ACE2-S binding and only two S- mutants are falsely predicted to have
little to no effect on the interaction.
We can evaluate the mutant models to try to explain why two of the validation mutants are
misclassified. The discordance between the mCSM-PPI2 prediction and experiment for
Lys353His is surprising because mCSM-PPI2 correctly identifies the other Lys353 mutants,
Lys353Ala and Lys353Asp, as causing a severe reduction in the ACE2-S interaction. Methods
Figure 2 compares the interactions of the wild-type and mutant complexes at these sites.
The size of the residues is a clear difference between the mutants, resulting in fewer
hydrophobic contacts in the Lys353Ala and Lys353Asp mutants. Additionally, Lys353His can
form ring-ring interactions with Tyr759 on the RBD, which could compensate for the fewer
hydrophobic contacts in this mutant. These considerations go some way to explain why
Lys353His is predicted to have less impact on ACE2-S binding than Lys353Ala or Lys353Asp,
but they do not explain the discrepancy with the experimental result. One factor that might
be at play is that the protonation state of the mutant His could modulate its inhibition of
ACE2 S binding and this might not be well-modelled by mCSM-PPI2. The second
misclassified mutation is another Lys mutant. Methods Figure 3 shows the environment of
ACE2 Lys31 and Lys31Asp. The sidechain of Lys31 is oriented away from the SARS-CoV S
interface allowing the Lys β- and ɣ-carbons to form hydrophobic interactions with S Tyr442
and Tyr475. In free ACE2, Lys31 is oriented outward and is fully exposed and it has been
suggested that the internal neutralisation of Glu35 by Lys31 in the ACE2-S complex is
required for efficient binding39. In Lys31Asp, there are fewer hydrophobic interactions, but
the carboxyl group forms an H-bond with Tyr442 that could compensate. These interactions
might explain the relatively small predicted ΔΔG of −0.25 kcal/mol and it could be that
mCSM-PPI2 does not recognise the importance of the internal neutralisation for binding.

options to address this deficit. First, we recognise that the ability to predict mutations that

increase ΔG as well as those that lower ΔG was part of the design specification for mCSMPPI212. This objective was advanced by extending the mutant affinity training data with
hypothetical reverse mutations to mitigate the bias towards destabilising mutations12. With
this in mind, we could simply accept this stated capability of the algorithm at face value and
assume a symmetric threshold of +1.0 kcal/mol to identify mutations that will significantly
enhance binding. This is technically equivalent to extrapolating the relationship between
ΔΔG and experimental ACE2-S association (Methods Figure 1A) past 0 kcal/mol, which
warrants some explanation. Forward extrapolation of the linear trend in Methods Figure 1A
above 0 kcal/mol would yield predicted assay results > 100 %, reaching ≈ 200 % by +2.0
kcal/mol. Although values greater than 100% were observed in the experimental binding
assay (and are valid)10, the assay is bounded above by an unknown quantity that in our
estimation should correspond to the inverse of the ratio of immunoprecipitated ACE2 by the
C-terminal tag antibody to the total amount of ACE2 in the sample. This ceiling represents
the point at which all mutant ACE2 is immunoprecipitated by the S1-Ig fusion protein used
in the original assay10.
An alternative approach is hinted at by the reverse mutations the mCSM-PPI2 developers
used to augment their training dataset with complex stabilising mutations. Since ΔΔG is a
thermodynamic state function, ΔΔGreverse = −ΔΔGforward, and any deviation in the predicted
result is an error12. This means that the reverse mutations of the experimental mutants that
inhibit binding lead to enhanced binding. These can be readily modelled, for example, to
model the reverse mutation for Asp355Asn we submitted the mCSM-PPI2 model of
Asp355Asn and requested a prediction for Asn355Asp. Methods Figure 1B illustrates the
relationship between the experimental binding assays and predicted ΔΔGreverse. Generally,
ΔΔGreverse follows our expectations (Methods Figure 1C), with most ΔΔGreverse > 0 kcal/mol
and displaying a negative linear correlation with ΔGforward (ρ = −0.78), but there are a few
moderate outliers amongst the S- mutations with apparently underestimated ΔΔGreverse.
These outliers contribute to a reduction in correlation with the experimental assays
compared to that achieved with the forward mutations (Methods Figure 1B, ρ = 0.41), which
leads to poorer performance as a predictor of the assay results (Methods Figure 1B). An
overall reduction in concordance was expected, since starting from predicted models runs
the risk of compounding errors, but it is not clear if the reduced sensitivity is due to
generally poorer sensitivity of mCSM-PPI2 towards mutations that enhance affinity or a
consequence of these errors. However, we can still achieve good specificity with ΔΔG
thresholds of > 1.0 kcal/mol (TPR = 0.29, TNR = 0.95) or slightly more relaxed > 0.5 kcal/mol
(TPR = 0.57, TNR = 0.84).
These results indicate that mCSM-PPI2 is applicable to the ACE2 coronavirus S complex and
that ΔΔG is a good predictor for S-protein affinity. A threshold of ΔΔG < −1.0 kcal/mol is
calibrated to a strong reduction or total abolition of ACE2 S binding affinity. For potential
affinity enhancing variants, ΔΔG > +1.0 kcal/mol is a sensible starting point that should yield
high specificity but if increased sensitivity is desirable then a relaxed threshold as low as
ΔΔG > + 0.5 kcal/mol is appropriate.

introduced to increase binding with ACE2. mCSM-PPI2 predicts that S Asn439Arg enhances
S-protein since mutations to the wild-type is predicted to destabilise ACE2-S (ΔΔG = −0.25
kcal/mol for S Arg439Asn in PDB 6vw1; ΔΔGreverse = 0.11 kcal/mol), although notably this
prediction does not meet our strict thresholds. Although the mutation itself does enhance
ACE2-S binding10, its presence does not appear to significantly influence mCSM-PPI2
predicted ΔΔG of gnomAD variants. This is shown in Methods Figure 4, which compares
predictions from the chimeric RBD (i.e., PDB 6vw1) to those from a model of the RBD with
Asn439 modelled in 6vw1; these are practically identical (ρ = 1.00). Despite this, the variant
residue conformations can be influenced by the presence of the engineered residue (§2.2.1)
but it appears that for all gnomAD variants, where this happens the alternative
conformations yield the same or very similar ΔΔG.

Enumerating possible ACE2 missense SNPs
The ACE2 gene (ENSG00000130234) was retrieved from Ensembl in Jalview14. Two identical
CDS transcripts (ENST00000427411 and ENST00000252519) were found with the Get CrossReferences command corresponding to ACE2 full-length proteins (ENSP00000389326 and
ENSP00000252519). These correspond to the UniProt ACE2 sequence Q9BYF1. The CDS was
saved in Fasta format and this was parsed in Python with Biopython. The CDS was broken
into codons and all possible single base changes were enumerated and translated using the
standard genetic code. This provided the set of amino acids accessible to each residue via a
single base change.

Software
Jalview 2.1114 was used for interactive sequence data retrieval, sequence analysis, structure
data analysis and figure generation. UCSF Chimera16 and PyMol20 were used for structure
analysis and figure generation.
The pyDRSASP15 packages, comprising ProteoFAV, ProIntVar and VarAlign were used
extensively for data retrieval and analysis as described in Methods. Biopython was used to
process sequence data.

Supplementary Figure 1. Functional residues in ACE2 and their overlap with missense variants and mutagenesis assays.
Each track is the ACE2 sequence with a different set of annotations. A. UniProt annotations. Highlights: signal peptide
(orange), SARS-CoV binding (dark grey, positions 30-41, 82-84 and 353-357), glycosylation site (blue) disulphide bond
(purple), other binding (pink), metal binding (sand), essential for ADAM17 processing (magenta, 652-659), essential for
TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS11D processing (green, 697-716) and transmembrane region (yellow, positions 741-761) B. structural
coverage in PDB ID: 6vw1. C. gnomAD missense variants (dark red). D. SARS-CoV-2 S-protein interacting sites (light green to
green, proportional to minimum distance to S-protein partner). E. residues with a SARS-CoV interaction mutagenesis assays
(light pink to dark pink proportional to effect on ACE2-S affinity). For example, the figure shows that S19 is the first residue
resolved in PDB ID: 6vw1 (track B), has a gnomAD missense variant (track C) and is in contact with SARS-CoV-2 S (track D).
