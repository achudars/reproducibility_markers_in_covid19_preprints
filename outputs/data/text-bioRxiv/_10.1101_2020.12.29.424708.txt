Abstract
The Spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 mediates
the viral particle's binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
receptor on the surface of human cells. Therefore, Spike-ACE2 interaction is a
crucial determining factor for viral infectivity. A new phylogenetic group of SARSCoV-2 (lineage B.1.1.7) has been recently identified in the COVID-19 Genomics
UK Consortium dataset, which features an amino acid substitution in the Spike
RBD (N501Y mutation). Infections with the SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 have
been overgrowing in recent weeks in the United Kingdom, indicating an even
greater spread capacity than that seen with previous strains of the novel
coronavirus. We hypothesized that this rapid spreading/infectivity of the B.1.1.7
lineage might be due to changes in the interaction force between the mutant
Spike RBD and ACE2. This study employed in silico methods involving
mutagenesis (N501Y mutation) and interface analysis focusing on the Spike
RDB-ACE2 interaction. The results showed that the SARS-CoV-2 N501Y mutant
(lineage B.1.1.7) establishes a more significant number of interactions relating to
the mutant residue Y501 (Spike RDB) with residues Y41 and K353 (ACE2). This
finding shows that the increased infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 is
associated with the interaction force between the Spike RBD Y501 mutant
residue with the ACE2 receptor, which in this strain is increased.

Introduction
The fast SARS-CoV-2 spreading among humans is pushing its molecular
evolution. So far, the virus has accumulated mutations at a rate of up-to-twonucleotide changes every month. Recent isolates of the SARS-CoV-2 feature at
least 20 nucleotide changes in their genomes than the earliest isolates in January
2020 (Rambaut et al., 2020).
Most of the variability found in SARS-CoV-2 isolates feature mutations
within the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD), a portion of the Spike
glycoprotein that mediates viral attachment to the angiotensin-converting enzyme
2 (ACE2) receptor on the surface of human cells (Shang et al., 2020).
The emergence of the SARS-CoV-2, B.1.1.7 lineage, detected in early
December 2020
by the
COVID-19
Genomics
UK
Consortium
(https://www.cogconsortium.uk/) (Kupferschmidt, 2020; Rambaut et al., 2020;)
represents an example, among several other, of the fast viral molecular evolution.
The B.1.1.7 lineage is somewhat surprising, as it accumulates 17
mutations in its genome. Eight of them are located in the gene that encodes the
Spike protein on the virus surface (Rambaut et al., 2020). The RBD is crucial for
Spike docking with the ACE2 receptor on the surface of human cells (Kemp et
al., 2020). B.1.1.7 lineage phenotype has also attracted attention, as it proves to
be much more transmissible among humans than the other known SARS-CoV-2
lineages (Kupferschmidt, 2020; Rambaut et al., 2020;).
The N501 has been identified as a residue that increases the binding
affinity to human ACE2 (Starr et al., 2020). According to Rambaut et al. (2020),
the mutation N501Y found in the B.1.1.7 lineage, which is located at the Spike
gene, covers one of the six key contact amino acid residues within the Spike
RBD.
Determinations of the Spike RDB domain's surface affinity strength with
the ACE2 receptor have enabled mapping of the amino acid residues that may
represent desired targets for the development of vaccines against COVID-19 or
antibody-based therapies against SARS-CoV-2 (Sternberg and Naujokat, 2020).
However, quantitative impact of the SARS-CoV-2 N501Y mutation on the
Spike RBD affinity to the ACE2 receptor is still unknown.
In this study, we raised the hypothesis that N501Y mutation increases the
interaction force between Spike RBD and ACE2 receptor.
To test this, we used in silico tools to mutagenize and cause the N501Y
mutation in the Spike RDB domain, at the protein level, and simulate the
molecular interactions with the ACE2 receptor. Comparisons between wild type
versus mutant Spike RDB structures showed that the mutant N501Y RDB
interacts
with
greater
affinity
to
the
ACE2
receptor.

Methods
Spike RDB-ACE2 interface analysis
This study uses the structure deposited in the Protein Data Bank available
at (https://www.rcsb.org/), code 6M0J. The PyMOL software, available at
(https://pymol.org/2/), was used to: 1) visualize the interaction between the amino
acid residue N501 of the Spike RDB domain (SARS-CoV-2, isolate Wuhan-Hu1, NCBI reference genome sequence NC_045512.2) and the Y41 residue of the
human ACE2 receptor protein, 2) simulate the N501Y mutation found in the
isolate SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 (Rambaut et al., 2020) and 3) analyze the
interactions resulting from the Spike (RDB) N501Y mutation.
Moreover, we used PDBePISA software (Krissinel and Henrick, 2007),
available at (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pisa/) for a detailed analysis of the Spike
RDB-ACE2 quaternary structures, comparing the interaction resulting from the
Spike N501 or Y501 mutant residue regarding their chemical properties and the
predicted dissociation pattern.
Statistical analyses
The server PDBSum (Laskowski et al., 2018), available at
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/pdbsum/Generate.html), was used
for comparative statistics of the interfaces formed between the Spike N501, or
the respective N501Y mutant residue, with ACE2 receptor.
Results

The original SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD-ACE2 interface region feature the
N501 amino acid residue (Spike RBD) that establishes two non-bonded contacts
with the Y41 and K353 residues (ACE2) at 3.5-angstrom distance as predicted
by the PyMOL and PDBsum softwares (Figure 1).

In contrast, PyMOL and PDBsum indicates that the mutant SARS-CoV-2
N501Y (lineage B.1.1.7) features the Y501 residue (Spike RBD) that establishes
one hydrogen bond with K353 residue and non-bonded interactions with Y41,
D38 and K353 residues of the ACE2 receptor at 3.5-angstrom distance (Figure
2).

In addition, PDBePISA analysis predicted the interactions at the interface
amino acid residue N501 Spike(RBD)-ACE2 (Figure 3).

involving the residues Y500, Y501, G502, V503, and Y505 from the Spike RBD

Figure 4. PDBePISA prediction analysis showing the possibility for increased interactions at the
N501Y mutant Spike(RBD)-ACE2 interface. The surrounding 501Y residues (Y500, G502, V503
and Y505) feature increased interaction force with the ACE2 receptor.

Statistical analysis of the RBD-ACE2 interface
The chemical nature of the interactions between amino acid residues was
predominantly non-covalent, as determined by the PDBSum software. The
mutant Spike RBD Y501 residue resulted in greater apolar and hydrogen bonds
with ACE2 Y41 and K353 residues. Noteworthy, the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage
establishes a more significant number of interactions with the ACE2 receptor. In
addition to the mutant Y501 residue, the non-mutant border residues, such as
Y500, G502, V503, and Y505, show polar interactions with the ACE2 receptor
(Figure 5).

Discussion
This study shows through in silico protein-protein interface analysis that
the mutation N501Y in the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARSCoV-2, lineage B.1.1.7, establishes increased interaction with the ACE2 receptor
when compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1 lineage.
The lineage B.1.1.7 is highly transmissible and infectious among humans
(Rambaut et al., 2020). Since the beginning of December 2020, its spreading in
the United Kingdom significantly increased (Rambaut et al., 2020; Kupferschmidt,
2020).

The N501Y mutation occurs in the receptor-binding domain (RDB) of the
Spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2, a crucial region during the virus's interaction
with the ACE2 receptor on the surface of the human cells and progress with the
infection (Starr et al., 2020).
Therefore, we hypothesized that the mutation N501Y, found in the strain
B.1.1.7, could cause the Spike protein to establish stronger interactions with the
ACE2 receptor.
The hypothesis was confirmed when we performed the Spike (RBD)-ACE2
interaction analysis by comparing SARS-CoV-2 (lineage Wuhan-Hu-1) Spike
RBD residue N501 versus the mutant residue Y501, lineage B.1.1.7.
The nature of the interactions was predominantly non-covalent and
involving hydrogen bonds, polar and apolar bonds.
Interestingly, the N501Y mutation causes a change in the spacing between
the amino acid residues of the Spike protein, represented by the Buried Surface
Area in PDBePISA. We observed that this type of alteration causes the amino
acid residues around the 501Y residue to establish more interactions with the
ACE2 receptor.
Together, these changes cause the Spike protein in the RBD segment of
strain B.1.1.7 to interact more strongly with the ACE2 receptor.
The greater Spike-ACE2 interaction strength may support a better
understanding of the high infectivity and spread the SARS-CoV-2, lineage
B.1.1.7, or other strains featuring similar characteristics, based on the molecular
affinity between the virus and its host cells.
