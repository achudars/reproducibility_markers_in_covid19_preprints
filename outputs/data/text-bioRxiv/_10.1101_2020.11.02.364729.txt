ABSTRACT

31

Despite the growing knowledge of T cell responses and their epitopes in COVID-19

32

patients, there is a lack of detailed characterizations for T cell-antigen interactions and

33

T cell functions. Using a peptide library predicted with HLA class I-restriction,

34

specific CD8+ T cell responses were identified in over 75% of COVID-19

35

convalescent patients. Among the 15 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes identified from the S and

36

N proteins, N361-369 (KTFPPTEPK) was the most dominant epitope. Importantly, we

37

discovered 2 N361-369-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) with high functional avidity,

38

and they exhibited complementary cross-reactivity to reported N361-369 mutant variants.

39

In dendritic cells (DCs) and the lung organoid model, we found that the N361-369

40

epitope could be processed and endogenously presented to elicit the activation and

41

cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells ex vivo. Our study evidenced potential mechanisms of

42

cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2, illuminating natural ways of viral clearance with

43

high relevancy in the vaccine development.

INTRODUCTION

60

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) results in the global

61

pandemic of COVID-19 (Dong et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). So far, over 40 million

62

positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been reported with one million deaths

63

worldwide (https://covid19.who.int/). Despite the fact that most patients can recover

64

spontaneously with supportive care, COVID-19 mortality rate is still a worrying

65

social concern. A better understanding of the adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2

66

infection is important to assist vaccine development and evaluation.

67

SARS-CoV-2 contains four structural proteins, namely nucleoprotein (N),

68

membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E) and spike glycoprotein (S) (Zhou et al.,

69

2020). SARS-CoV-2 S protein is responsible for the virus-target cell recognition

70

(Hoffmann et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). It has been

71

demonstrated that the S protein was capable of inducing not only humoral immunity

72

but also cellular immunity (Cao et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Grifoni et al., 2020b;

73

Ju et al., 2020; Le Bert et al., 2020a; Ni et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020; Weiskopf et al.,

74

2020). And the S protein has always been the primary consideration for SARS-CoV-2

75

vaccine development (Corbett et al., 2020a; Mercado et al., 2020b; Yu et al., 2020).

76

Besides the S protein, the N protein can also elicit high levels of T cell responses in

77

COVID-19 patients, highlighting the possibility that S and N are both predominant

78

targets for T cell responses in SARS-CoV-2 (Grifoni et al., 2020b; Le Bert et al.,

79

2020b; Peng et al., 2020). It is still unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 is effective to

80

induce long-lasting protective immunity due to the limited time window

81

post-outbreak.

82

Pandemic outbreaks of infectious diseases resulted from pathogenic human

83

coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and middle eastern respiratory syndrome

84

coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have caused high mortality in the past two decades. For

85

SARS-CoV, evidences supporting T cell immunity to its N protein has been reported,

86

with some still observed over 17 years later in SARS-CoV infected individuals (Le

87

Bert et al., 2020b). Because SARS-CoV N protein exhibits more than 90% homology

88

of amino acid sequence to that of SARS-CoV-2 (Grifoni et al., 2020a), it is natural to

89

suspect that T cell responses to the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 may also provide

90

cellular immune protection, which may last for a long time. Recently, using predicted

91

or established peptide libraries of the S and N proteins, a number of SARS-CoV-2 T

92

cell epitopes were identified in COVID-19 convalescent patients across independent

93

studies, providing important clues for vaccine development (Chour et al., 2020;

94

Ferretti et al., 2020; Le Bert et al., 2020b; Nelde et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Poran

95

et al., 2020; Shomuradova et al., 2020; Snyder et al., 2020). However, detailed

96

information of how SARS-CoV-2 induces cellular immune responses is currently

97

limited.

98

Cellular immunity against viral infections is mediated by cytotoxic T cells, which

99

eliminate the viruses by killing infected cells. To trigger optimal T cells responses,

100

viral antigens must be processed before binding to the major histocompatibility

101

complex (MHC) molecules to form the peptide-MHC complex (pMHC), which is

102

then presented on the cell membrane. When TCRs identify the cognate pMHC,

103

together with matching CD8 co-receptor binding to the MHC, the T cells will be

104

activated. Such activation is dependent on the binding kinetics of the TCR-pMHC,

105

which is influenced by the density of processed epitopes on the membrane of the

106

virus-infected cells or antigen presenting cells (APC) (Campillo-Davo et al., 2020;

107

Gonzalez et al., 2005). Particularly, CD8 co-receptor is indispensable for enhanced

108

activation of T cells with low-affinity TCRs, but not for T cells with high-affinity

109

TCRs. (Campillo-Davo et al., 2020; Lyons et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2017). Activation of

110

T cells independent of the CD8 co-receptor reflects the high functional avidity of their

111

TCRs. Hence, the functional avidity of TCRs is a critical parameter to be evaluated

112

for determining the pMHC recognition and posterior T-cell activation, which is

113

essential for the killing of virus-infected cells and effective viral clearance

114

(Campillo-Davo et al., 2020).On the other hand, RNA viruses have a tendency to

115

accumulate mutations over time (Duffy, 2018; Villa et al., 2020), which present

116

challenges for T cell-based vaccine development. Therefore, it is important to identify

117

predominant epitopes together with diverse TCRs carrying broader cross-reactivity to

118

SARS-CoV-2 and its mutant variants, which can provide detailed information to

119

understand the mechanisms of T cell-mediated viral clearance in COVID-19 patients.

120

In this study, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T cell responses in

121

COVID-19 convalescent patients with HLA-A2, HLA-A24 or HLA-A11 allele, the 3

122

most prominent HLA-A alleles in the Asian population (He et al., 2018). A total of 15

123

epitopes derived from SARS-CoV-2 S and N were identified. The most dominant

124

epitope N361-369 (KTFPPTEPK) were characterized in detail, including the wild type

125

and clinically presented mutant variants of N361-369 and the functional avidity of

126

N361-369-specific TCRs. Our study is, to our knowledge, the first to reveal that an

127

immunodominant CD8+ T cell epitope derived from SARS-CoV-2 N can be

128

intracellularly processed and presented by DCs and lung organoids, leading to robust

129

T cell activation and cytotoxicity. Our findings illustrated potential mechanisms of

130

CD8+ T cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could be of great use to

131

understand the viral control process and to facilitate the vaccine development for

132

COVID-19.

RESULTS

135

Identification of SARS-CoV-2 Specific CD8+ T Cell Epitopes

136

It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins were the predominant T cell

137

targets in COVID-19 patients (Grifoni et al., 2020b). In order to predict SARS-CoV-2

138

specific CD8+ T cell epitopes, the NetMHCpan 4.0 algorithm was used to analyse the

139

binding of 9-mer peptides derived from the full lengths of SARS-CoV-2 S and N

140

proteins, with HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*24:02 and HLA-A*11:01, the 3 most frequent

141

HLA class I A alleles in the Asian population. We synthesized a peptide library of 72

142

predicted SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, which overlapped 29 SARS-CoV epitopes, together

143

with additional 6 confirmed SARS-CoV epitopes (Table S1) (Ahmed et al., 2020;

144

Grifoni et al., 2020a). Among these 78 peptides, 62 were from the S protein and 16

145

were from the N protein, with 3 different HLA-A restrictions (Table S2).

146

In parallel, we collected a total of 37 COVID-19 convalescent PBMC samples and

147

subjected them for the HLA typing analysis. Among the 20 HLA-A2+ samples and the

148

12 HLA-A24+ samples revealed by flow cytometric assay, we selected 8 samples from

149

each group. A matching 8 samples with HLA-A*11:01+ genotype was identified by

150

RT-PCR, which included 2 overlapping with the HLA-A2+ group and 2 with the

151

HLA-A24+ group (Table S3). These PBMCs were stimulated for 10 days in the

152

presence of individual peptide mixtures and IL-2, and the induction of IFN-γ secretion

153

was determined by the enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT)assay. We found that

154

75% COVID-19 convalescent PBMCs demonstrated positive T cell responses when

155

stimulated by corresponding peptide mixtures. Particularly, the HLA-A2+ group

156

showed dominant responses to Mixture (M) 1/3/5, the HLA-A24+ group to M6/7 and

157

the HLA-A*11:01+ group to M14 (Figures 1A-1C and S1). Next, individual peptides

158

from each positive mixture were applied to identify specific T cell epitopes, and 15

159

SARS-CoV-2 specific peptides were found to be recognized by the convalescent

160

PBMCs (Figures 1A-1C, S2 and S3; Tables 1 and S5). Among the 15 positive

161

peptides, 5 peptides were derived from the N protein, and the rest were derived from

162

the S protein (Table 1). Four dominant peptides were identified, with at least one

163

peptide from each HLA group (Table 1). Two of these peptides, P63 (N338-346) and P77

164

(N219-227), were both HLA-A*02:01-restricted, and they could induce IFN-γ release in

165

4/8 and 2/8 samples, respectively (Figures 1A and S2; Table 1). The

166

HLA-A*24:02-restricted P45 (S448-456) was located at the receptor binding domain of

167

the S protein and could be recognized by 2/8 samples tested (Figure 1B; Table 1).

168

Importantly,

169

HLA-A*11:01-restricted P64 (N361-369). Hence we termed P64, or N361-369, as the most

170

dominant epitope in this study (Figure 1C; Table 1). Of note, IFN-γ induction was not

171

observed when these 4 dominant peptides were used to stimulate PBMCs of healthy

172

individuals (Figure S4; Table S4). Overall, these data demonstrated that 15 predicted

173

peptides derived from the S and the N protein sequences could induce

174

SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses in about 75% of COVID-19

176

CD8+ T cell epitopes.

177
178

Identification of Specific CD8+ TCRs to SARS-CoV-2 Dominant Epitopes

179

To identify the dominant epitope-specific TCRs, we selected P64, P45 and P63, the

180

most dominant epitopes from the 3 HLA-A alleles. After stimulated with these

181

epitopes, the populations of IFN-γ secreting T cells from the corresponding

182

COVID-19 convalescent patient samples were sorted at single cell levels (Figure 2A).

183

The TCRs of sorted cells were amplified (Hamana et al., 2016), and the sequences of

184

the variable regions of α- and β-chains were analysed. In the P64-specific TCR

185

repertoire, we found 7 dominant TCR clones (TCR 1-7), with the most dominant

186

clone 1 (TCR 1) accounted for 17.82% (Figure 2B). Similarly, 3 dominant P63 TCR

187

clones and 5 dominant P45 TCR clones were obtained, with the most dominant clone

188

accounted for 10.34% and 33.34% respectively (Figure 2B). These results showed

189

that COVID-19 convalescent patients with these three HLA-A restrictions could

190

produce diverse T cell clones for the recognition of corresponding dominant epitopes.

191

Furthermore, the specificities of the P64 reactive TCRs were verified in CD8+

192

Jurkat cells, which were transduced with the top 4 dominant TCR clones (TCR 1-4).

193

Using the P64-HLA-A*11:01 tetramer, we confirmed that only TCR 1 and TCR 4

194

were P64-specific (Figure 2C; Table S6). Also, with co-culture of the

195

HLA-A*11:01-expressing COS-7 cells loaded with P64, TCR 1- or TCR 4-transduced

196

CD8+ Jurkat cells could be activated, indicated by elevated CD69 expression (Figure

197

2D). These observations were not found with TCR 2 or TCR 3 (Figures 2C and 2D).

198

Altogether, we successfully identified 2 different CD8+ TCRs targeting the

199

SARS-CoV-2 dominant epitope P64 (N361-369) from the COVID-19 convalescent

200

PBMCs.

Characterization of the Functional Avidity of the N361-369-Specific TCRs

203

To further evaluate the functional activities of the N361-369-specific TCRs, TCR 1 and

204

TCR 4 were individually transduced into the primary CD3+ T cells isolated from the

205

PBMCs of healthy individuals. These cells were expanded for 12 days following the

206

rapid expansion protocol (REP) (Jin et al., 2012), before the evaluation of their

207

transfection efficiency by N361-369-HLA-A*11:01 tetramer. We found that 9.86%

208

CD8+ T cells expressed TCR 1 and 6.34% expressed TCR 4 (Figure 3A).

209

Unexpectedly, we observed higher percentages of TCR-transduced CD4+ T cells, with

210

38.4% for TCR 1 and 11.7% for TCR 4 (Figure 3A). These results indicated that

211

TCR-transduced CD4+ T cells were able to recognize the N361-369-HLA complex with

212

the absence of CD8 co-receptor. Also, the similar fluorescence intensities detected in

213

the CD4+ T cells and in the CD8+ T cells implied that TCR 1 and TCR 4 might both

214

have high avidity for the N361-369-HLA-A*11:01 complex (Figure 3A). To confirm the

215

binding of these TCRs to N361-369-HLA-A*11:01 was independent of CD8 co-receptor,

216

TCR 1 and TCR 4 were separately transduced to CD8- and CD8+ Jurkat cells. Both

217

TCR 1- and TCR 4-transduced CD8- Jurkat cells showed positive tetramer staining,

218

and comparable fluorescent signal levels were found between CD8- and CD8+ Jurkat

219

cells (Figure 3B). These results were in line with those of the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells

220

(Figures 3A and 3B).

221

Next, we evaluated the functionality of TCR 1 and TCR 4 in CD8+ T cells and

222

CD4+ T cells from expanded CD3+ T cells expressing TCR 1 or TCR 4. After

223

co-cultured with HLA-A*11:01+ K-562 cells pulsed with N361-369, remarkable levels

224

of T cell activation were detected in TCR 1- and TCR 4-CD8+ T cells, indicated by

225

the upregulation of T cell activation marker CD137 expression, compared to the

226

DMSO controls (Figure 3C). Similar results were obtained in TCR-transduced CD4+

227

T cells stimulated with N361-369 (Figure 3C). Moreover, we evaluated the cytotoxicity

228

of TCR 1- and TCR 4-transduced CD8+ T cells against HLA-A*11:01+ K-562 cells,

229

using Calcein-AM release assay. Significant levels of target cell lysis were detected in

230

the presence of N361-369, relative to the DMSO controls (Figure 3D). Increasing

231

cytotoxic efficiency was observed at the effector to target (E:T) cell ratios of 20:1 or

232

higher, and approximately 70% target cell lysis was achieved at E:T cell ratio of 40:1

233

(Figure 3D). The functional activity of TCR 1- and TCR 4-transduced CD4+ T cells

234

was analysed by the production of IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α via cytokine secretion

235

assay. We found that N361-369 could elicit significant induction of all three cytokines in

236

these CD4+ T cells, comparing to an equimolar amount of DMSO (Figure 3E). These

237

results proved that the N361-369-specific TCR 1 and TCR 4 could mediate the

238

cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells and the effector cytokine secretion of CD4+ T cells.

239
240

Evaluation of the Affinity and the Cross-Reactivity of the N361-369-Specific TCRs

241

We addressed the functional avidity of TCR 1 and TCR 4 to the N361-369-HLA

242

complex with the peptide concentrations required to induce a half-maximal activation

243

(EC50) per IFN-γ production by the TCR-transduced T cells. The IFN-γ release assay

244

revealed that the EC50 concentrations of TCR 1 and TCR 4 in CD8+ T cells were

245

46.83 nM and 47.17 nM respectively, when stimulated by HLA-A*11:01+ K-562 cells

246

loaded with sequential ten-fold dilutions of the N361-369 peptide (Figure 4A). Notably,

247

TCR 1 and TCR 4 in CD4+ T cells also demonstrated high functional avidity, with

248

EC50s of 118 nM and 380.9 nM respectively, in a co-receptor independent manner

249

(Figure 4A). These data confirmed that TCR 1 and TCR 4 both had high affinity to

250

the N361-369-HLA complex in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells.

251

Recently, SARS-CoV-2 mutation strains have been reported continuously. To

252

evaluate whether TCR 1 and TCR 4 could recognize known N361-369 mutations, we

253

synthesized a total of 9 mutant peptides with clinically presented point mutations of

254

residues between 361 to 369 amino acids of the N protein (Figure 4B; Table S7)

255

(Zhao et al., 2020). The HLA binding assay revealed that 7 different point mutations

256

(T362I, F363L, F363S, P364L, P364R, T366I and E367K) did not affect the binding

257

of N361-369 to HLA*A11:01, whereas T362K markedly diminished the ability of the

258

NT362K peptide to bind to HLA*A11:01. These results, particularly the different

259

reactivity of NT362I and NT362K, implied that the charge of amino acid side chain, at

260

least, might influence the binding affinity of N361-369 to HLA*A11:01. We also found

that the N361-369 homologous peptide from MERS-CoV (NMERS), which exhibited 3

amino acids in difference to N361-369, bound to HLA*A11:01 weakly (Figure 4B).

Meanwhile, IFN-γ production was evaluated for the reactivity of TCR 1- and TCR

264

4-CD8+ T cells, after co-culturing TCR-transduced cells with HLA-A*11:01+ COS-7

265

cells loaded with each mutant peptide. We observed that N361-369-specific TCR-T cells

266

responded differently to these mutant peptides. The T366I, F363L or T362I mutations

267

of N361-369 could still induce high levels of IFN-γ production, but not other point

268

mutations (Figure 4B). Interestingly, we found that NT366I preferably led to an

269

activation of the TCR 1-T cells similar to that of the wild type N361-369, and the TCR

270

4-T cells were mainly activated by NT362I or NF363L (Figure 4B). These findings

271

indicated that N361-369-specific TCRs derived from the COVID-19 convalescent

272

patients had cross-reactivity to certain N361-369 variants. Altogether, the N361-369 is

273

shown to be a T cell epitope with strong immunogenicity that can be recognized by a

274

diversity of TCRs with high affinity. Such diverse TCRs may play critical protective

275

roles in SASR-CoV-2 infection and decrease the mutation driven immune escape.

276
277

Confirmation of the Endogenous Presentation of the N361-369 Epitope

278

Furthermore, we studied whether the bioinformatically predicted N361-369 epitope

279

could be naturally processed and presented from SARS-CoV-2 N protein. First, as

280

dendritic cells (DCs) can ingest virus-infected cells or cellular fragments and

281

cross-present antigens to activate CD8+ T cells, we tested whether the N361-369

282

specific-TCR-T cells could be activated by the N protein loaded mature DCs that

283

were induced from the HLA-A*11:01+ healthy donors’ monocytes. Substantial levels

284

of T cell activation were detected in TCR 1- and TCR 4-CD8+ T cells, indicated by

285

elevated CD137 expression, comparing to the S protein loaded groups (Figure 5A).

286

Also, we found significantly higher levels of IFN-γ secretion in the N protein loaded

287

groups, relative to the S protein controls (Figure 5B).

288

Next, we verified whether N361-369 could be endogenously presented by lung

289

epithelial cells that were infected by SASR-CoV-2. To this end, we established a

290

series of lung tissue organoids, and HLA-A*11:01+ lung organoids, referred as LO,

291

were selected for the subsequent experiments (Figures S5A-5C). The expression of N

292

protein in lung organoid (N-LO) was achieved by ectopically expressing the N protein

293

via the lentiviral EGFP system, with the transfection efficiency confirmed by

294

fluorescent detection (Figure S5D). The lung organoids expressing S protein (S-LO)

295

were used as control. After N361-369-specific TCR-T cells were co-cultured with N-LO

296

or S-LO for 24 hours, flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that only N-LO could

297

induce an activation of these TCR-CD8+ T cells, indicated by enhanced CD137

298

expression and significantly elevated IFN-γ production (Figures 5C and 5D). These

299

results demonstrated that the N361-369 epitope could be naturally processed from the

300

full length N protein, and presented on the surface of APCs by the intracellular HLA

301

machinery, leading to the activation of N361-369 specific CD8+ T cells.

302

To evaluate the N361-369 activated CD8+ T cells could kill lung organoids, we

303

co-cultured HLA-A*11:01+ LO loaded with the N361-369 peptide with TCR 1-CD8+ T

304

cells. After 24 h, we observed apparent organoid lysis, together with the recruitment

305

of TCR 1-T cells, only with the presence of N361-369 (Figure 5E). We found a

306

significantly higher level of target cell lysis in the N361-369 loaded group, when these

307

effects were quantified by Calcein-AM release assay (Figure 5E). To determine

308

whether the cytotoxic CD8+ T cells could eliminate infected lung organoids, we

309

co-cultured HLA-A*11:01+ N-LO or S-LO with TCR 1-CD8+ T cells. We found that

310

lung organoids with endogenous expression of the N protein became more susceptible

311

to the cytotoxicity of specific T cells, comparing to the S-LO group (Figure 5F). Such

312

difference of the cytotoxic effect was statistically significant, analysed by LDH

313

release assay (Figure 5F). Taken together, we identified a dominant T cell epitope,

314

N361-369, that could activate specific CD8+ T cells, and the cytotoxicity of these T cells

315

would result in the lysis of virus infected cells, executively managing the virus

316

clearance in COVID-19 patients.

DISCUSSION

319

Currently, limited information is available for the mechanisms of the cellular

320

immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Better understanding of the T cell responses and

321

their protective effects are essential for the vaccine development for COVID-19. Here,

322

we have identified immunodominant epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins

323

that can induce specific CD8+ T cell responses, in the majority of COVID-19

324

convalescent patients with HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*24:02 or HLA-A*11:01.

325

Importantly, we have discovered N361-369, a dominant epitope from the N protein, and

326

2 different CD8+ TCRs recognizing N361-369. These 2 TCRs displayed high functional

327

avidity for the wild-type and the mutant variants of N361-369, which provided

328

complementary protections for each other against SASR-CoV-2. We are the first to

329

present evidence that N361-369 can be endogenously presented by HLA-A*11:01 on

330

APCs, which, in turn, can activate specific CD8+ T cells that may contribute to

331

effective virus clearance in COVID-19 convalescent patients.

332

Both the S and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported to effectively

333

eliciting CD8+ T cell responses (Grifoni et al., 2020b). Indeed, when stimulated by

334

synthesized peptides corresponding to SARS-CoV-2 S and N, robust CD8+ T cell

335

responses could be detected in nearly 75% of COVID-19 convalescent PBMCs

336

(Figure 1; Table S5). Strikingly, we found that 3 out of 4 dominant peptides were

337

derived from the N protein, and accounted for approximately 50% of tested CD8+ T

338

cell reactivity. These data suggested that the N protein might be a dominant target for

339

CD8+ T cell recognition. Similar observations have been made (Grifoni et al., 2020b;

340

Weiskopf et al., 2020). Of note, T cell responses to the 4 dominant CD8+ T cell

341

epitopes identified in our study were not observed in uninfected individuals (Figure

342

S4), while cross-reactivities with other common coronaviruses in unexposed healthy

343

donors had been reported. This difference might due to the refined sample size of

344

healthy donors with corresponding HLA restrictions in our study. Contrast to the

345

rather limited HLA-A phenotype information associated with available T cell epitopes

346

from COVID-19 samples, we provided 15 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes for the 3 most

347

prominent HLA class I A alleles in the Asian population (Table 1), offering more

348

accurate information for vaccine designs. Of these dominant epitopes, the

349

HLA-A*11:01-restricted N361-369 (KTFPPTEPK) was found in 5/8 COVID-19

350

PBMCs (Figure 1C; Table 1). Independently, this epitope has also been identified in

351

multiple individuals in the British COVID-19 convalescent patients (Peng et al.,

352

2020). These findings strongly suggested that N361-369 was highly immunogenic and

353

capable to induce robust CD8+ T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2.

354

Presently, reports for SARS-CoV-2 inducing cellular immune responses were

355

largely focused on the T cell-antigen reactivity. Detailed mechanisms regarding the

356

cellular immunity in COVID-19 convalescent patients were needed for advancing the

357

vaccine development and evaluation. In our study, we found 2 N361-369-specific TCRs

358

with distinct functions. When ectopically transduced, they could elicit CD8+ T cell

359

cytotoxicity upon target cells (Figure 3D), and mediate the activation of T helper type

360

1 CD4+ T cells to secret cytokines in a CD8-independent manner (Figure 3E). It has

361

been reported that such independency could only be achieved when the TCR

362

exhibited high-affinity binding to the cognate pMHC (Campillo-Davo et al., 2020;

363

Lyons et al., 2006; Tan et al., 2017). In the affinity test of the N361-369-specific TCRs in

364

the transduced CD8+ T or CD4+ T cells, we found that their EC50 concentrations

365

ranged from 47.17 nM to 380.9 nM (Figure 4A). These values are remarkably smaller

366

than most of the reported thresholds of affinity for maximal T-cell activity to peptide

367

epitopes, which were around 5-10 µM (Oren et al., 2014; Schmid et al., 2010; Tan et

368

al., 2015; Zhong et al., 2013). Hence, our data evidenced that the N361-369-specific

369

TCRs had high affinity and functional avidity, both of which were key features to

370

induce sufficient levels of T cell activation for antivirus responses. As a newly

371

emerged single stranded RNA virus belonging to the highly contagious coronavirus

372

subfamily, SARS-CoV-2 has a tendency to accumulate mutations over time (Duffy,

373

2018; Villa et al., 2020). Here, another innovative piece of our finding was that the 2

374

distinct N361-369-specific TCRs could recognize multiple N361-369 mutations in

375

complementary (Figure 4B). Thus, our findings have revealed the high functional

376

avidity of the 2 TCRs for N361-369, with compatible characteristics for clinical mutants

377

of this epitope, providing practical tools to interpret potential mechanisms of CD8+ T

378

cell responses against SARS-CoV-2, which are highly relevant in vaccine design and

379

evaluation.

380

Viral antigens can be phagocytosed and cross-presented by DCs to prime CD8+ T

381

cells, or directly processed and presented by infected cells to activate cellular immune

382

responses. Having proven the strong immunogenicity of N361-369 in vitro, it is of

383

physiological importance to confirm that the N protein can be processed and

384

presented naturally. We proved that N361-369 could be presented by DC cells and

385

elicited robust activation of specific CD8+ T cells (Figures 5A and 5B). Similarly,

386

marked CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity were observed with lung organoids either

387

exogenously loaded or endogenously expressing the N361-369 epitope (Figures 5C-5F).

388

The significance of CD8+ T cell response for viral clearance has been demonstrated in

389

SARS-CoV infection (Channappanavar et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2010). Therefore, our

390

findings from DCs and the lung organoid model have, for the first time, revealed

391

potential mechanisms of cellular immunity to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infected lung

392

cells.

393

At present, majority of COVID-19 vaccine candidates under development focus on

394

SARS-CoV-2 S protein as the antigen, due to its location and functional significance

395

in virus entry (Chandrashekar et al., 2020; Corbett et al., 2020b; Keech et al., 2020;

396

Mercado et al., 2020a; Yang et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Hereby, we

397

have presented evidences of 4 dominant SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, most of which were

398

derived from the N protein, highlighting the potential benefit of SARS-CoV-2 N in

399

vaccine optimization. It should be mentioned that the sequence of the N361-369 epitope

400

is identical to a fragment of the SARS-CoV N protein, as this region of the two

401

coronaviruses share more than 90% homology (Grifoni et al., 2020a). In fact, of the

402

total 15 SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes presented in our study, 8 were independently

403

confirmed with amino acid sequences identical to SARS-CoV (Tables 1 and S1),

404

indicating probable cross-protective effects of vaccines developed according to these

405

CD8+ T cell epitopes.

406

A larger sample size with subgrouping of COVID-19 patients based on the

407

intensities of their diseases may better represent epitope diversities and be

408

advantageous to understand the correlations between various T cell immune responses

409

and the disease severities. In addition to bioinformatics predicted peptide pools, the

410

application of peptide libraries covering the entire SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences

411

can add detailed resolution of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses and is

412

currently under investigation. The magnitude and breadth of the observed cytotoxic

413

effect of CD8+ T cells may be subjected for debate, and potential undesired

414

pathological damage resulted from the T-cell immunity should be addressed in future

415

studies.

416

In conclusion, this study has demonstrated potent and broad SARS-CoV-2-specific

417

CD8+ T cell responses in the majority of COVID-19 convalescent patients. These

418

confirmed immunodominant epitopes and the identified TCRs provide critical

419

knowledge to understand the cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and the

420

mechanisms for eliminating infected cells, and revealed valuable candidates for

vaccine designs.

extract (BME), type 2 (Trevigen, USA). Drops of 40 μl BME-cell suspension were

499

added into 24-well plates and solidified at 37°C for 10-20 min. Then 400 μl of AO

500

medium was added to each well and culture in the 37°C incubator with 5% CO2. The

Peptide Library

505

To define the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes of the S and N proteins

506

derived from SARS-CoV-2 reference sequences (GenBank: MN908947). The

507

NetMHCpan 4.0 algorithm (Jurtz et al., 2017) was used to analyze the binding of

508

9-mer peptides derived from the full lengths of SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins, with

509

HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*24:02 or HLA-A*11:01. For each allele, binding peptides

510

with high strength (Rank Threshold < 0.5) were selected, and a total of 72 predicted

511

epitopes were generated. Additional 6 SARS-CoV epitopes were selected (Ahmed et

512

al., 2020; Grifoni et al., 2020a) (Table S1). Individual peptide’s HLA-A specificity

513

was listed in Table S2. All 78 epitopes were synthesized (GenScript) and dissolved in

514

the corresponding solvents for the subsequent experiments. Detailed information for

515

peptide grouping was summarized in Table S2.

To screen the HLA-A*11:01 phenotypes of the COVID-19 convalescent patients and

519

health individuals, we used Dynabeads™ mRNA DIRECT™ Purification kit (Thermo

PCR primer information (Simon et al., 2014). The PCR products were ligated into the

523

T vector (TransGen Biotech, China) and then transformed into the Trans5α competent

524

cells (TransGen Biotech, China). Single bacterial clones of each sample were selected

525

for PCR verification and sequencing. The sequencing results were analyzed in the

526

IMGT/HLA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/) website.

527

The HLA-A2 and HLA-A24 typing of the COVID-19 convalescent patients and

528

health individuals were analyzed using flow cytometry. For staining, 5×105 PBMCs

529

were resuspended in PBS with 2% FBS (FACS buffer), and stained with the

530

HLA-A2-PE (MBL, Clone BB7.2, K0186-5, Japan) or HLA-A24-PE (MBL, Clone

In vitro Stimulation of IFN-γ-producing CD8+ T Cells with Selected Peptides

538

PBMCs were plated in 24-well plates at 2×106 cells per well with 100 IU/ml IL-2

539

(PeproTech, USA) in the complete medium, which was RPMI-1640 supplemented

540

with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 25 mM HEPES and 10 μg/ml gentamicin. The

541

cells were subsequently stimulated with indicated pools of predicted SARS-CoV-2

542

peptides, at 5 μM for each peptide. Cells were cultured for 10 days to expand specific

543

T cell populations to corresponding stimulations. Half of the media were refreshed

544

every 3 days, or as required. At day 10, cells were harvested and tested for

545

peptide-specific CD8+ T cells by the IFN-γ release ELISPOT assay. The remaining

546

cells were cryopreserved and stored in liquid nitrogen until used in assays.

552

T cells were rested in cytokine-free media overnight. Then 2×104 T cells were seeded

553

per well in ELISPOT plates and stimulated for 24 h with pools of predicted

554

SARS-CoV-2 peptides (5 μM each). Stimulation with an equimolar amount of DMSO

555

was performed as the negative control, and Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate

556

(PMA)/Ionomycin (P/I) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was used as the positive control.

557

Subsequently, the plates were developed with human biotinylated IFN-γ detection

558

antibody (Clone 7-B6-1, 1 μg/ml, Mabtech, Sweden), followed by incubation with

559

Streptavidin-AP (1:1000, Mabtech, Sweden) and BCIP/NBT-plus substrate (Mabtech,

560

Sweden). IFN-γ spots were quantified with the AID ELISPOT Reader (AID,

561

Germany). To quantify positive peptide-specific responses, with 2 × mean spots of the

562

unstimulated wells subtracted from the peptide-stimulated wells, and the results

563

565

Flow Cytometry Analysis

566

For staining, 5×105 cells were re-suspended in FACS buffer, and stained with the

567

anti-human antibody cocktail for 30 min at room temperature in the dark.

568

CD3-BV510 (Clone SK7), CD4-PerCP-Cy5.5 (Clone RPA-T4), CD8-FITC (Clone

569

HIT8a) and CD137-BV421 (Clone 4B4-1) were used for the activation induced T cell

570

marker assay. The P64-tetramer-PE used for the identification of antigen-specific

571

CD8+ T lymphocytes was generated using the PE QuickSwitch™ Quant

572

HLA-A*11:01 Tetramer Kit (MBL, tb-7305-k1, Japan). The IFN-γ Secretion Assay

573

Detection Kit (MACS, 130-090-762, Germany) was used for labeling IFN-γ secreting

574

T cells, which were sorted into DNase and RNase free 96-well PCR plates (Bio-Rad,

575

USA) at a single cell level by FACSAria III (BD Biosciences, USA).

576

Cytokine production was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Briefly,

577

T Cell Receptor Sequencing and Analysis

600

For single T cell PCR, the TCRα and TCRβ chain genes were amplified as previously

601

described (Hamana et al., 2016), with minor modifications. Briefly, the reverse

602

transcription (RT) reaction was performed in a two-step method following the

603

PrimeScript™ II Reverse Transcriptase kit protocol (Takara, Japan). For the first step,

604

single-cell sorted plates were thawed on ice and added with 5 μl mix containing dNTP

605

mixture and the primers for TCRα and TCRβ, then incubated at 65℃ for 5 min and

606

put on ice immediately. For the second step, the above plates were added with the

607

RNase inhibitor and PrimeScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Takara, Japan) to a total

608

volume of 10 μl. The RT program was 45℃ for 45 min and 70℃ for 15 min. The RT

609

products were amplified by nested PCR following the PrimeSTAR® HS DNA

610

Polymerase kit protocol (Takara, Japan), with primers for TCRα and TCRβ. Here, the

611

5×PrimeSTAR® Buffer (Mg2+ plus) in the kit was replaced with the 2 × PrimeSTAR®

612

GC Buffer (Mg2+ plus) (Takara, Japan). The first PCR program was as follows: 98℃

613

for 1 min, 98℃ for 10 sec for 30 cycles, 52℃ for 5 sec and 72℃ for 40 sec. The

614

resultant PCR mixtures were diluted 50-fold with water, and 2 µl of the diluted PCR

615

mixtures were added to 18 µl of the nested PCR mixture as the template DNA. The

616

nested PCR program was as follows: 98℃ for 1 min, 98℃ for 10 sec for 35 cycles,

617

52℃ for 5 sec and 72℃ for 30 sec. The PCR products were then analyzed with the

618

α-nest or β-nest primers by direct sequencing. The TCR repertoire was analyzed with

619

the IMGT/V-Quest tool (http://www.imgt.org/) (Brochet et al., 2008).

620
621

Enrichment of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T Cells

622

CD3+, CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were selected using the EasySep human CD3 positive

623

selection kit II, EasySep human CD4+ T cell enrichment kit and EasySep human CD8+

624

T cell enrichment kit (STEMCELL Technologies, Canada), respectively, according to

625

the manufacturer's instructions.

627

Construction of Lentivirus Vectors and Transduction of CD3+ T Cells

628

For the construction of TCR lentivirus vectors, TCRα or TCRβ chains were

629

amplificated from the corresponding nested PCR mixtures and cloned into the

630

lentivirus vector pWPXL (Addgene Plasmid #12257). The constant regions were

631

replaced by mouse counterparts with improved TCR pairing and TCR/CD3 stability

632

that were convenient for the detection of TCR-T cells (Cohen et al., 2006; Jin et al.,

633

2018). The coding sequence of the S or N gene of SARS-CoV-2 and the human

634

HLA-A*11:01 gene were synthesized, and cloned into the pWPXL vector.

635

Lentiviruses were generated by co-transfecting Lenti-X 293T cells with the

636

lenti-vector and the packaging plasmids psPAX2 (Addgene Plasmid #12260) and

637

pMD2.G (Addgene Plasmid #12259) at a ratio of 5:2:1, using the Xfect Transfection

638

Reagent (Takara, Japan). The lentiviral supernatants were harvested in 48 h.

639

Transduction of CD3+ T cells was conducted as delineated before (Jin et al., 2018),

640

with minor modifications. CD3+ T cells were stimulated in T cell media with 1 μg/ml

641

anti-CD3 antibody (Clone OKT3) and 1 μg/ml anti-CD28 antibody (Clone 15E8) for

642

2 days. Then, the transduction efficiency was assessed by flow cytometry using

643

anti-mouse TCR-β chain constant region antibody (Clone H57-597).

645

TCR Transduced-T Cell Rapid Expansion Protocol

646

TCR transduced-T cells were rapidly expanded with the method as described before

647

(Jin et al., 2012). Briefly, in indicated experiments, sorted T cells were expanded

648

using excess irradiated (50Gy) allogeneic PBMC feeder cells (a pool from 3-5

649

different donors) at a ratio of 1 to 100 with 30 ng/ml anti-CD3 antibody (Clone OKT3)

650

and 3000 IU/ml IL-2, in the 50/50 media consisted of a 1:1 mixture of the complete

651

media and the AIM-V media (Gibco, USA). All cells were cultured at 37°C with 5%

652

CO2. Media were exchanged 3 days post-stimulation and then every other day. The

653

cells were rapidly expanded in this way for two weeks, before use.

654
655

Antigen Presentation in Human DCs

656

DCs were incubated in AIM-V for 1 h and then 5 μg/ml recombinant N or S proteins

657

of SARS-CoV-2 were added. After 4 h, the media were replaced to DC media

658

supplemented with DC maturation cytokines including 10 ng/ml Lipopolysaccharide

659

(LPS) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 100 IU/ml IFN-γ (PeproTech, USA). After

660

incubated overnight, DCs were washed and co-cultured with TCR-T cells for 24 h.

661

The supernatants were used for measuring IFN-γ concentrations by ELISA.

662
663

TCR-T Cytotoxicity Assay

664

The ability of T cells to lyse target cells was measured using a Calcein-AM release

665

assay. Target cells were labelled for 15 min at 37°C with 10 μM Calcein-AM

666

(Dojindo, Japan), and then co-cultured with T cells at indicated ratios for 24 h in the

667

black-walled, 96-well flat-bottom plates (Corning, USA). The controls of these

668

labelled target cells were separated into the spontaneous death group and the maximal

669

killing group, the latter were treated with 0.1% Triton-X (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). After

670

24 hours, 50 μl/well supernatant was removed, and the relative fluorescence units

671

(RFUs) was measured by Varioskan LUX Multimode Microplate Reader (Thermo

672

Fisher Scientific, USA). The percentage of lysed cells was calculated as follows:

673

specific lysis = 100% × (Test RFUs - Spontaneous death RFUs) / (Maximal killing

674

RFUs - Spontaneous death RFUs).

675

The ability of T cells to lyse organoids was also measured using LDH-Glo™

676

Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

677

The organoids were dissociated to single cells and counted, which was used to infer

678

the number of organoids to allow co-cultured with T cells at a 4:1 effector:target ratio.

679

After co-cultured for 24 h in the 96-well flat-bottom plates, the relative luminescent

680

units (RLUs) of the co-culture and the control groups were measured by the Varioskan

681

LUX Multimode Microplate Reader. The percentage of lysed organoids was

682

calculated as follows: specific lysis = 100% × (Test RLUs - Spontaneous death RLUs)

683

/ (Maximal killing RLUs - Spontaneous death RLUs) .

Cytokine Release ELISA

686

The antibody pairs used for cytokine detection are as follows: IFN-γ capture antibody

687

(Clone MD-1, 2 μg/ml), IFN-γ detection antibody (Clone 4S.B3, 1 μg/ml), IL-2

688

capture antibody (Clone MQ1-17H12, 4 μg/ml), IL-2 detection antibody (Clone

689

Poly5176, 1 μg/ml), TNF-α capture antibody (Clone MAb1, 1 μg/ml) and TNF-α

690

detection antibody (Clone MAb11, 1μg/ml). The ELISA plate was coated with

691

individual anti-cytokine capture antibodies for 12 h, then washed with

692

phosphate-buffered saline with Tween (PBST) buffer for 3 times, followed by

693

blocking with 3% BSA for at least 1 h at room temperature. The supernatants of T cell

694

and target cell co-cultures were added into the plate at 50 μl per well. After incubation

704

Statistical Analysis

705

Statistical analyses of the data were performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.0

706

(GraphPad Software, Inc. La Jolla, CA, USA) software. Quantitative data in

707

histograms and line charts were presented as mean ± standard deviation (mean ± SD).

708

Statistical significance was determined using ANOVA for multiple comparisons.

709

Student’s t-tests were applied to compare two groups. A value of P < 0.05 was

710

considered statistically significant.
