TMEM41B - a poorly understood factor with roles in autophagy and lipid mobilization - is a critical pancoronavirus host factor.
SUMMARY
The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed the lives of more than one million people worldwide. The
causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, is a member of the Coronaviridae family, which are viruses that cause
respiratory infections of varying severity. The cellular host factors and pathways co-opted by SARSCoV-2 and other coronaviruses in the execution of their life cycles remain ill-defined. To develop an
extensive compendium of host factors required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal
coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E), we performed parallel genome-scale
CRISPR knockout screens. These screens uncovered multiple host factors and pathways with pancoronavirus and virus-specific functional roles, including major dependency on glycosaminoglycan
biosynthesis, SREBP signaling, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis, as well as an
unexpected requirement for several poorly characterized proteins. We identified an absolute
requirement for the VTT-domain containing protein TMEM41B for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and all
other coronaviruses. This human Coronaviridae host factor compendium represents a rich resource to
develop new therapeutic strategies for acute COVID-19 and potential future coronavirus spillover
events.

(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus from the Coronaviridae
family, which is composed of enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses with large (> 30kb) genomes that
can infect a variety of vertebrate hosts (Cui et al., 2019). Seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoVs),
such as the HCoV-OC43 betacoronavirus, as well as the HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E
alphacoronaviruses, can cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory infections with cold-like symptoms
in humans (Cui et al., 2019). In stark contrast, highly pathogenic betacoronaviruses have been
responsible for multiple deadly outbreaks in the 21st century, including severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV, 2003), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV,
2012), and SARS-CoV-2 (2019) (Cui et al., 2019). The spread of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was
contained, in part due to their comparatively low transmissibility (Cui et al., 2019). However, SARSCoV-2 spreads more readily and remains largely uncontrolled across the globe, presenting an urgent
health crisis.
A complete understanding of the host factors and pathways co-opted by SARS-CoV-2 and other
coronaviruses for the execution of their life cycles could contribute to the development of therapies to
treat COVID-19 and increase preparedness for potential future outbreaks. Large scale forward genetic
approaches based on RNA interference, insertional mutagenesis, and CRISPR have proven powerful
for identifying host factors required for infection by different viruses (reviewed in (Puschnik et al., 2017)).
Here, we performed parallel genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens to generate an extensive
functional catalog of host factors required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal
coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E). We identified multiple genes and
pathways with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles, including factors involved in
glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biosynthesis, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) signaling,
and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis, as well as several poorly characterized proteins,
such as Transmembrane Protein 41B (TMEM41B). We show that the VMP1, TMEM41, and TVP38

(VTT)-domain containing protein TMEM41B is a critical host factor required for infection by SARS-CoV2, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E, as well as several flaviviruses of high interest to public health
(Hoffmann & Schneider et al., ; see accompanying manuscript), thereby nominating it as a broadspectrum RNA virus liability and potential high-priority target for future drug development efforts.
RESULTS
Genome-wide CRISPR screens identify host factors required for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
We set out to develop an extensive catalog of human host factors required for infection by the pandemic
SARS-CoV-2 strain and three seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E)
(Cui et al., 2019) (Figure 1A). We employed high-throughput CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screening using
the well-established Brunello genome-wide library, which is composed of 76,441 single guide RNAs
(sgRNAs) targeting 19,114 human genes (Doench et al., 2016a). As a screening platform, we used
Cas9-expressing Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells (Huh-7.5-Cas9), which endogenously express the SARSCoV-2 cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as well as transmembrane serine
protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a key mediator of SARS-CoV-2 entry (Hoffmann et al., 2020b). We recently
showed that Huh-7.5-Cas9 cells are permissive to infection by SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43, HCoVNL63, and HCoV-229E, and that they are a robust system for CRISPR-based genetic screening
(Hoffmann et al., 2020a).
We performed a series of parallel genetic screens by transducing Huh-7.5-Cas9 cells with the Brunello
sgRNA library followed by antibiotic selection and expansion for seven days to ensure homogeneous
CRISPR-based knockout of host factor genes prior to infection with the panel of coronaviruses. In this
context, cells expressing sgRNAs targeting genes required for virus infection or virus-induced death
should survive while those expressing neutral sgRNAs or sgRNAs targeting genes irrelevant to infection
are expected to deplete. Similarly, cells expressing sgRNAs targeting essential genes with no roles in

virus infection or virus-induced death are expected to deplete in both “mock” (uninfected) and virusinfected conditions. SARS-CoV-2 screens were performed in triplicate at two physiologically relevant
temperatures, 33 ºC and 37 ºC, to mimic the temperatures of the upper and lower airways, respectively
(V’kovski et al., 2020). Surviving cells were harvested five days post-infection and subjected to genomic
DNA extraction and screen deconvolution using high-throughput sequencing (Hoffmann et al., 2020a).
Several quality control (QC) metrics demonstrated excellent technical performance across all screens
and biological replicates (Figure S1). First, we confirmed that 76,160/76,441 (99.6%) of sgRNAs from
the Brunello library were recovered from the plasmid preparation and that all screen libraries were
sequenced to saturation (Figure S1A). Second, pairwise correlation analyses demonstrated that
biological replicates from each genetic screen clustered together and shared a high correlation
coefficient (Figure S1B). Third, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves generated based on the
fitness effects of disruption of previously defined neutral and essential genes from the Brunello library
confirmed robust gene disruption in the cell pools (Figure S1C-D). The HCoV-229E screen, though
successful, was particularly stringent, resulting in a lower area under the curve (AUC) relative to the
other screens in this study. As described in our recent study (Hoffmann et al., 2020a), we performed a
z-score analysis as well as gene essentiality (beta) score using a published maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE) algorithm (Li et al., 2014). The gene essentiality analysis allowed us to stratify
candidate host factor targets based on their effects on cellular fitness under mock (uninfected)
conditions followed by the identification of high-confidence gene hits in virus-infected cells. Specifically,
genes with beta scores similar to essential genes could affect cell survival in the presence or absence
of infection and may be confounded by effects on cellular fitness. Conversely, genes with beta scores
similar to neutral sgRNAs are predicted to affect cell survival only during viral infection and are more
likely to be true positives. We implemented these parameters into our analysis pipeline and identified
146 and 171 genes that significantly influenced SARS-CoV-2-induced cell death at 37 ºC and 33 ºC,
respectively (FDR < 0.05) (summarized in Figure 1B-E, Figure S2B-C, and Table S1A-B). These

included the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and the well known host factor cathepsin L (CTSL) (Hoffmann
et al., 2020b; Letko et al., 2020; Yeager et al., 1992). MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 (Earnest et al., 2017;
Wang et al., 2013) and putative SARS-CoV-2 receptors KREMEN1 and ASGR1 did not score in any of
these screens (Gu et al., 2020). (Figure S2A). A total of 84 (37 ºC) and 99 (33 ºC) genes scored as
candidate host factors that may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection (z-score > 0; FDR < 0.05). Conversely,
62 (37 ºC) and 72 (33 ºC) genes scored as candidate antiviral host factors (z-score < 0; FDR < 0.05).
As expected, neutral and essential gene-targeting sgRNAs scored similarly across mock and SARSCoV-2 conditions (blue and red dots in Figure S2B-C, respectively). Integrating the 33 ºC and 37 ºC
SARS-CoV-2 screening datasets allowed us to obtain a clearer picture of candidate temperaturespecific host factors that either support or antagonize SARS-CoV-2 viral infection (Figure 1D-E and
Figure S2D). These results demonstrate that the human genome encodes a catalog of host factors
that functionally contribute to the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle.
Parallel genome-wide CRISPR screening against multiple human coronaviruses uncovers host
factor networks with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles
Viruses within the same family often require the same host factors to complete their respective life
cycles (Dimitrov, 2004). Nevertheless, there are several examples of closely related viruses with
discrete host factor requirements. For example, while SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 both engage
ACE2 as a cellular receptor, HCoV-229E uses ANPEP while HCoV-OC43 has no known essential
proteinaceous receptor (Cui et al., 2019; Forni et al., 2017). Beyond attachment factors and receptors,
closely related viruses can also exploit specific components of multiple intracellular pathways in a virusspecific manner. For example, we recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 appears to rely on the RAB10
and RAB14 small GTPases whereas HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-NL63 mainly require
RAB2A and RAB7A (Hoffmann et al., 2020a). A comprehensive functional understanding of the
commonalities and differences among coronaviruses and other virus families could pave the way for

both specific and general antiviral therapies. Towards this goal, we significantly expanded our functional
genomics efforts to develop an extensive functional catalog of human host factors required for infection
by members of the Coronaviridae family, including two alphacoronaviruses (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV229E) and one additional betacoronavirus (HCoV-OC43).
The results of these three additional CRISPR screens are shown in Figure 2A-C, Figure S3 and Table
S1C-E. An integrative analysis that also includes the two SARS-CoV-2 screens described above is
shown in Figure 2D. Taken together, these screens identified numerous coronavirus-specific and pancoronavirus host factors that appear to play critical roles during infection by each of these viruses. This
extensive network of human host factors functionally implicates numerous cellular pathways, as shown
in Figure 3A. We present a selection of comparative analyses below that highlight both pan-coronavirus
and virus-specific host factors through the lens of SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43 (betacoronaviruses)
The SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43 betacoronaviruses co-opt a significantly overlapping set of host
factors to carry out their life cycles. These include proteins involved in pathways related to GAG
biosynthesis (e.g., heparan sulfate) and transport, such as EXT1, EXT2, EXTL3, B3GALT6, B3GAT3,
B4GALT7, SLC35B2, XYLT2, HS2ST1, and NDST1 (Aikawa et al., 2001; Bai et al., 2001; Casanova
et al., 2008; Cuellar et al., 2007; Kitagawa et al., 1998; Kreuger and Kjellén, 2012; Lind et al., 1998;
Okajima et al., 1999; Ponighaus et al., 2007). We also identified multiple factors that regulate
intracellular protein trafficking, processing, and sorting through the cis-oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex,
including COG2, COG3, COG4, COG7, and COG8 (Blackburn et al., 2019; Smith and Lupashin, 2008)
(Figure 3A,D,G). Consistent with the role of heparan sulfate as an attachment factor for multiple
viruses, the heparan sulfate biosynthesis pathway has been previously implicated as a critical host
pathway for several viruses and virus families, including herpes simplex virus (O'Donnell and Shukla,
2008), human papillomavirus (Giroglou et al., 2001; Joyce et al., 1999), respiratory syncytial virus

(Bourgeois et al., 1998; Escribano-Romero et al., 2004; Feldman et al., 2000; Hallak et al., 2000; Harris
and Werling, 2003; Karger et al., 2001; Krusat and Streckert, 1997; Martinez and Melero, 2000;
Techaarpornkul et al., 2002), adenoviruses (Dechecchi et al., 2001; Dechecchi et al., 2000), hepatitis
C virus (Xu et al., 2015), dengue and Zika virus (Cruz-Oliveira et al., 2015; Marceau et al., 2016; Savidis
et al., 2016), West Nile virus (Perera-Lecoin et al., 2013), Rift Valley fever virus (Riblett et al., 2016),
Eastern equine encephalitis virus (Gardner et al., 2011), and HIV (Ibrahim et al., 1999), among others.
These studies support the central functional role of heparan sulfate proteoglycans and other
glycosaminoglycans as common mediators of binding and entry for many viruses. Indeed, recent
cellular and biochemical evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 exploits heparan sulfate proteoglycans
cooperatively with ACE2 to bind to and gain entry into cells (Clausen et al., 2020b). Given that no
protein has been identified as a cellular receptor for HCoV-OC43 entry, it is possible that this
betacoronavirus engages one or more GAGs to invade target cells.
Another set of top-scoring factors in common between the SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43 screens were
related to cholesterol homeostasis, particularly those related to SREBP cleavage-activating protein
(SCAP)-mediated cholesterol sensing and the SREBP pathway (Figure 3A-B, Figure S4A-B). Indeed,
genes known to be functionally involved in the sensing and biosynthesis of cholesterol, such as SCAP,
SREBF2 (but not SREBF1), MBTPS1, MBTPS2, and SAR1A were among the top enriched genes for
these two viruses (Figure 3A-B). These results are consistent with our recent discovery that SARSCoV-2 and other coronaviruses require SCAP, NPC2, and EMC1 to carry out their life cycle (Hoffmann
et al., 2020a) and extend these findings to further elaborate the essential regulatory components of
SREBP signaling. We also note a unique reliance by HCoV-OC43 on factors involved in the synthesis
of GPI anchored proteins (Figure 3A,C). Collectively, these results nominate factors involved in GAG
biosynthesis and transport, intracellular protein trafficking, processing, and sorting, and cholesterol
homeostasis as potential targetable factors to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43.

SARS-CoV-2-specific host factors
We also identified host factors and pathways that appear to be required for SARS-CoV-2 infection but
less so for other coronaviruses tested. Genes that participate in the mevalonate pathway, which is
regulated by SREBP and is responsible for converting mevalonate into sterol isoprenoids, such as
cholesterol (Buhaescu and Izzedine, 2007; Goldstein and Brown, 1990), were among the top scoring
hits (Figure 3A,B, Figure S4A, Figure S5A). Multiple sgRNAs targeting 3-Hydroxy-3-MethylglutarylCoA Synthase 1 (HMGCS1), which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid,
mevalonate kinase (MVK), which catalyzes the phosphorylation of mevalonic acid into
phosphomevalonate, and phosphomevalonate kinase (PMVK), which converts phosphomevalonate to
mevalonate 5-diphosphate, were significantly enriched in SARS-CoV-2 screens, although to a lesser
extent than SREBP signaling (Figure 3A,B and Figure S5A). These results suggest that factors and
intermediates of the mevalonate pathway, which are known to play important roles in post-translational
modification of many proteins involved in key processes, such as intracellular signaling and protein
glycosylation (Buhaescu and Izzedine, 2007; Goldstein and Brown, 1990), are important for the life
cycle of SARS-CoV-2.
Another set of top-scoring genes in SARS-CoV-2 screens encode multiple subunits of the exocyst
complex, which regulates the tethering of secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane and their
subsequent SNARE-mediated membrane fusion and exocytosis (Martin-Urdiroz et al., 2016; Wu and
Guo, 2015) (Figure 3G). Multiple sgRNAs targeting EXOC1, EXOC2, and EXOC4 were significantly
enriched, suggesting a critical role for these factors in mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection and virusinduced cell death. The mammalian exocyst complex is known to interact with specific RAB GTPases
to coordinate intracellular trafficking (Babbey et al., 2010; Mei and Guo, 2018). Indeed, sgRNAs
targeting RAB6A and RAB10 were also among the most significantly enriched hits in SARS-CoV-2
screens (Figure 3), a finding that is consistent with our recent work identifying RAB10 as a putative
9

SARS-CoV-2-specific host factor (Hoffmann et al., 2020a). These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2
relies on specific intracellular host factors and complexes that govern intracellular transport.
Another complex that appears to play an essential role in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle is the Mediator
complex (Figure 3 and Figure S5B). The mammalian Mediator is an evolutionarily conserved protein
complex composed of at least 28 subunits that regulates transcription by functionally connecting
general transcription factors with the core transcriptional machinery (Allen and Taatjes, 2015). The
Mediator subunits MED10, MED12, MED15, MED16, MED23, and MED24 were among the top-scoring
genes in SARS-CoV-2 screens, suggesting a critical role for this complex during infection and death by
this virus (Figure 3). Intriguingly, a non-overlapping set of Mediator subunits was recently implicated in
HIV-1 replication, including MED6, MED7, MED11, MED14, MED21, MED26, MED27, MED28, and
MED30 (Ruiz et al., 2014), suggesting that different viruses might have specific requirements for
members of this complex during transcription and replication of their genomes.
Beyond well-characterized pathways that were represented by multiple components, we also identified
factors with less understood network-level connections (Figure 3A). These include the EMC genes
(Figure S5C), DEAH-Box helicases DHX36 and DHX38, Golgin family proteins GOLGA6L1 and
GOLGA8O, the General Transcription Factor IIIC subunits GTF3C5 and GTF3C6, tRNA
methyltransferases TRMT5 and TRMT6, G protein-coupled receptors GPR89A and GPR89B,
Transmembrane P24

trafficking proteins TMED2 and TMED10, and genes involved

in

phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis, such as PCYT2 and EPT1, among others (Figure 3A and
Table S1). Further mining of SARS-CoV-2 host factor networks could expand the repertoire of potential
targetable factors to treat COVID-19.
Given the genome-scale depth of this screening data, we sought to determine if interactome focused
networks were significantly enriched in a genome-wide context. A recent SARS-CoV-2 CRISPR screen
in an African green monkey Vero-E6 cells (Wei et al., 2020) failed to detect significant enrichment from
10

a SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein network derived from IP-MS (Gordon et al., 2020). We recently
tested genes from this protein-protein interactome with a focused CRISPR screen and assigned
functional relevance to numerous members (Hoffmann et al., 2020b). In our genome scale screens, we
subsetted z-scores from the full interactome in Gordon et al., and detected a modest significant
enrichment for hits in a genome-wide context (Figure S5D). Upon subsetting the functionally relevant
members from our focused screen in Hoffmann et al., we observed a striking increase in significance
(Figure S5D). The subsetted heatmap of hits in Hoffmann et al., mapped onto genome scale data
largely cross validated many, but not all of our prior key findings (Figure S5E). These results
demonstrate the power and utility of focused CRISPR screens to complement the breadth of genomewide efforts.
HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E (alphacoronaviruses)
Interestingly, the catalog of host factors essential for infection by the HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E
alphacoronaviruses is significantly different than that of betacoronaviruses (Figure 2, Figure 3A, and
Figure S4C-D). Furthermore, these viruses apparently rely on substantially different pathways to carry
out their life cycles. Consistent with the literature, both screens successfully identified the cognate virus
receptors, as evidenced by robust enrichment of sgRNAs targeting ACE2 (HCoV-NL63) and ANPEP
(HCoV-229E) (Hoffmann et al., 2020b; Letko et al., 2020; Yeager et al., 1992) (Figure 2 and Figure
3). Intriguingly, HCoV-NL63 seems to rely on a core set of host chromatin regulators with known
functional interactions, including EP300, KDM6A (also known as UTX), KMT2D (also known as MLL4),
MED23, MED24, MEN1, PAXIP1, and SETDB1. This raises the tantalizing possibility that HCoV-NL63
co-opts the well established UTX-MLL4-EP300 enhancer remodeling network (which also contains
PAXIP1) (Wang et al., 2017) to reprogram the host transcriptome for successful infection (Figure 3A
orange nodes). In addition, we observed a requirement for factors involved in BMP signaling with
HCoV-NL63 specific factors SMAD4, SMAD5, ACVR1, and BMPR1A (Figure 3F). Lastly, our screening

results suggest that HCoV-229E is particularly dependent on members of the HOPS complex, including
VPS11 and RAB7A (Figure 3A) (Balderhaar and Ungermann, 2013). Collectively, our results
demonstrate that even closely related viruses, such as the HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E
alphacoronaviruses, can employ markedly different host factor pathways during infection.
Integrative analyses identify TMEM41B as a critical host factor for SARS-CoV-2
As shown in Figure 1B-E, Figure 2, and Figure 3A, sgRNAs targeting TMEM41B were among the
most significantly enriched sgRNAs across the SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E screens.
TMEM41B is a poorly understood ER-localized transmembrane protein that was recently implicated in
the autophagy pathway (Moretti et al., 2018; Morita et al., 2018; Shoemaker et al., 2019). Specifically,
TMEM41B deficiency was shown to lead to accumulation of ATG proteins, thereby blocking the
autophagy pathway at the early step of autophagosome formation. In addition, TMEM41B deficiency
was shown to trigger the abnormal accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets. These phenotypes have
been linked to the function of another autophagy factor, vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1), which
shares a rare and characteristic VTT domain (Morita et al., 2019). Interestingly, multiple sgRNAs
targeting VMP1 were significantly enriched in the HCoV-229E screen (Figure 2C) while there was a
trend towards enrichment in the SARS-CoV-2 screens that did not meet the cutoff for statistical
significance due to variability between replicates. These findings prompted us to look into the autophagy
network across all coronavirus screens in more detail.
TMEM41B was the only autophagy-related gene that scored as a significant hit across our multiple
coronavirus screens while only a handful of genes involved in the nucleation and tethering steps scored
for HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-299E (Figure 4A). This was a striking finding given that we concurrently
identified TMEM41B as a critical host factor for infection by multiple biosafety level three (BSL3) and
BSL4 members of the Flaviviridae family, including 1) the mosquito-borne flaviviruses Zika virus, yellow
fever virus, West Nile virus, and dengue virus, 2) the tick-borne flaviviruses Powassan virus, tick-borne

encephalitis virus, Kyasanur forest disease virus, Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus, and Alkhurma
hemorrhagic fever virus, and 3) other members of the Flaviviridae, including hepatitis C virus from the
hepacivirus genus and bovine viral diarrhea virus from the pestivirus genus (Hoffmann & Schneider et
al., ; see accompanying manuscript). Comparative analyses between one such flavivirus, Zika, and
SARS-CoV-2 screens suggested that TMEM41B is the only host factor that is critical for infection by
both viruses (Figure 4B) (Hoffmann & Schneider et al., ; see accompanying manuscript). Indeed,
genetic disruption of TMEM41B was sufficient to render cells resistant to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and
all of the seasonal coronaviruses and, importantly, infectivity could be reconstituted by TMEM41B
cDNA expression (Figure 4C). Interestingly, TMEM41B sub-cellular localization changed dramatically
upon infection by SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 4D). While mock-infected cells exhibited a diffuse reticular-like
pattern of TMEM41B localization in the cytoplasm, cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 were characterized
by large TMEM41B cytosolic aggregates and positive immunostaining for SARS-CoV-2 NS4A and
NS4B viral proteins (Figure 4D). Thus, TMEM41B is a critical host factor required for infection by
coronaviruses and several other pathogenic viruses and represents an attractive target for further
intensive study.
DISCUSSION
The full complement of human proteins and pathways required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 remains
poorly defined. A more complete understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that are coopted by coronaviruses could catalyze drug development efforts to combat the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic and prepare for potential future outbreaks. We performed parallel genome-scale CRISPRCas9 knockout screens to generate the most extensive functional catalog of host factors required for
infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV229E) reported to date (Figure 3A and Table S1). This catalog contains multiple host factors and
pathways that play critical pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles (Figure 3A).

We identified a profound requirement for factors involved in GAG (e.g., heparan sulfate) biosynthesis,
transport, and modification during infection by the SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43 betacoronaviruses.
These results suggest that HCoV-OC43 might engage one or more GAGs to invade target cells, and
support recent studies showing that SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously co-opts heparan sulfate
proteoglycans and ACE2 to gain entry into cells (Clausen et al., 2020a). Of note, HS2ST1, a component
of the heparan sulfate biosynthetic pathway, was identified in the present study as well as in our prior
work (Hoffmann et al., 2020a). These results nominate factors involved in GAG biosynthesis,
modification, and transport as potential targetable factors to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43.
We also identified proteins that mediate cholesterol homeostasis via SREBP signaling as key host
factors for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43. These results agree with and substantially
extend results from our recent functional interactome study demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 and other
coronaviruses require SCAP, NPC2, and EMC1 to carry out their life cycles and elucidate the essential
regulatory components of SREBP signaling (Hoffmann et al., 2020a). In addition, these results are
consistent with work on several other viruses, including Ebola virus (Carette et al., 2011) and hantavirus
(Kleinfelter et al., 2015), among others. Beyond SREBP signaling, we also identified three of the key
enzymes from the mevalonate pathway (HMGCS1, MVK, and PMVK), which is responsible for
converting mevalonate into sterol isoprenoids, such as cholesterol (Figure 3A, Figure 3B, Figure
S4A). Given that statins – one of the most widely used class of drugs in the world – block mevalonate
production via inhibition of the HMGCoA reductase and have been recently associated with improved
outcomes among COVID-19 patients (Fajgenbaum and Rader, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020), it is tempting
to speculate that pharmacological modulation of the mevalonate pathway could be a promising strategy
for treating COVID-19.
Another set of critical host factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection are involved in regulating intracellular
transport, tethering, and exocytosis of secretory vesicles, including RAB GTPases (Figure 3A, Figure
14

S4E). These results lend further support to our recent nomination of RAB10 as a putative SARS-CoV2 host factor (Hoffmann et al., 2020a) and suggest that different coronaviruses might have differential
requirements or preferences for intracellular transport proteins.
We also uncovered an unexpected robust dependency on the Mediator complex (Figure 3A, Figure
S4B). Intriguingly, a non-overlapping set of Mediator subunits was recently implicated in HIV-1
replication (Ruiz et al., 2014), suggesting that different viruses might have specific requirements for
members of this complex during transcription and replication of their genomes. Therefore, one might
speculate that selective targeting of host Mediator subunits using small molecules (e.g., CDK8
inhibitors; (Hofmann et al., 2020; Solum et al., 2020)) could be leveraged as a therapy to disrupt SARSCoV-2 infection (Bancerek et al., 2013; Napoli et al., 2012; Spaeth et al., 2011).
Beyond well-characterized pathways represented by multiple components, we also identified factors
with less understood network-level connections, including the DHX36 and DHX38 DEAH-Box
helicases, the GOLGA6L1 and GOLGA8O Golgin family proteins, the TRMT5 and TRMT6 TRNA
methyltransferases, the GPR89A and GPR89B G protein-coupled receptors, the TMED2 and TMED10
Transmembrane P24 trafficking proteins, and a pair of genes involved in phosphatidylethanolamine
biosynthesis, such as PCYT2 and EPT1, among others (Figure 3A and Table S1). Further mining of
this SARS-CoV-2 host factor essentiality compendium could expand the repertoire of potential
targetable factors to treat COVID-19.
The compendium of human factors co-opted by the HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E alphacoronaviruses
significantly differs from that of the SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43 betacoronaviruses (Figure 3A). For
instance, HCoV-NL63 seems particularly dependent on chromatin regulators with known functional
interactions,

including

the

the

HCoV-NL63 co-opts the well established UTX-MLL4-EP300 enhancer remodeling network (Wang et

al., 2017) to reprogram the transcriptome of the host for successful infection (Figure 3A). On the other
hand, HCoV-229E seems particularly dependent on HOPS complex proteins, including VPS11 and
RAB7A (Figure 3A) (Balderhaar and Ungermann, 2013). These results demonstrate that coronaviruses
from the same genera, including the HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E alphacoronaviruses, can employ
different host factor pathways during infection.
By integrating our Coronaviridae screening data with additional Zika virus and yellow fever virus
CRISPR screening data (Hoffmann & Schneider et al., ; see accompanying manuscript), we identified
TMEM41B as a critical host factor for infection by SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV229E. TMEM41B is a poorly understood ER-localized transmembrane protein that was recently shown
by three independent groups to regulate autophagy in conjunction with VMP1 (Moretti et al., 2018;
Morita et al., 2018; Shoemaker et al., 2019). Strikingly, TMEM41B was the only autophagy-related gene
that scored as a significant hit across the SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-229E CRISPR
screens (Figure 4A), and it was subsequently validated as a co-factor for HCoV-NL63 as well (Figure
4C). This suggests a putative autophagy-independent role for TMEM41B as a pan-coronavirus
replication factor. Moreover, our functional and mechanistic work showing that TMEM41B is a required
host factor for infection by more than ten flaviviruses (Hoffmann & Schneider et al., ; see accompanying
manuscript) suggested that TMEM41B is the only human protein that is critical for infection by both
virus families. Thus, TMEM41B is a critical host factor required for infection by all of the coronaviruses
tested in our study, as well as several other viruses of high public health interest, representing an
attractive target for further investigation and development of antiviral therapies.
Coronavirus host factor discovery and validation is an active area of research with multiple studies
appearing on preprint servers in recent months (Baggen et al., 2020; Heaton et al., 2020; Hoffmann et
al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020b). Wei et al., performed genome-wide
CRISPR screens in the African green monkey cell line Vero-E6 and reported strong dependency on

ACE2 and CTSL, both of which were also identified in our study (Wei et al., 2020). Interestingly, while
Wei et al., found that histone cell cycle regulator (HIRA) was a potent negative regulator of SARS-CoV2 in Vero-E6 cells, our study found the opposite in Huh-7.5 cells. Heaton et al., performed a similar
screen in A549 cells engineered to express ACE2 and identified serine/arginine-rich protein-specific
kinase 1 (SRPK1) as a single dominant hit that is unique to their screen (Heaton et al., 2020). They
showed that an SRPK1/2 inhibitor was inhibitory to HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2 at 17–53 µM in vitro,
a concentration well above the Ki for SRPK1 with unknown consequences to cell viability. Like Heaton
et al., Zhu et al., performed a similar screen using A549-ACE2 cells (Zhu et al., 2020b). However, in
contrast to Heaton et al., they identified known host factors such as ACE2 and CTSL, as well as
elements of the retromer complex, the COMMD/CCDC22/CCDC93 (CCC) complex, the Wiskott–
Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homologue (WASH) complex, the actin-related proteins-2/3
(Arp2/3) complex and others, but not SRPK1. More recently, Wang et al., performed a series of screens
using Huh7.5.1-ACE2-IRES-TMPRSS2 cells (Wang et al., 2020). Of note, Huh7.5.1 cells do not
express ACE2 in contrast to the parental Huh-7.5 cells used in the present study. Wang et al., identified
four significant host factors, one of which was SCAP, validating our prior finding that SCAP plays an
important role in coronavirus infection (Hoffmann et al., 2020a). The remaining three significant host
factors were also identified in our study: TMEM106B, VAC14, and ACE2. By contrast, our study
identified 128 high-confidence host factors, perhaps in part due to our inclusion of multiple replicates
per screen and two temperatures for SARS-CoV-2 as compared to single replicates and temperatures
in the Wang et al., SARS-CoV-2 screen. Most recently, Baggen et al., reported results of SARS-CoV2 and HCoV-229E screens using Huh-7 cells (Baggen et al., 2020). Their study highlighted TMEM106B,
similar to Wang et al., and the present study, as well as TMEM41B, the focus of the present study and
our accompanying paper on the role of TMEM41B as a pan-flavivirus host factor (Hoffmann &
Schneider et al., ; see accompanying manuscript). Baggen at al., further demonstrated activity of
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3 (PIK3C3) / vacuolar protein sorting 34 (VPS34)

inhibitors across multiple coronaviruses, although the mechanism of action for SARS-CoV-2 is unclear
as PIK3C3 appeared to be dispensable for SARS-CoV-2 based on their results and on the present
study, although it does appear essential for HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 in multiple studies described
above.
The results of this study should be interpreted within the context of its limitations. If a gene did not score
in our screens, it does not rule out that gene being an important SARS-CoV-2 factor for a number of
reasons. First, pooled CRISPR screens may not identify functionally redundant or buffering genes
(Ewen-Campen et al., 2017). Second, Huh-7.5 cells were chosen based on their infectivity by multiple
coronaviruses; however, it should be understood that they are not airway cells. Nevertheless, a recent
study demonstrated that hits in Huh-7 cells translate to human cells of lung origin (Baggen et al., 2020).
Furthermore, as shown in Figure S6, the vast majority of genes identified here are expressed in human
cells and tissues known to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. Lastly, our current experimental system is
limited to assessing survival and can not interrogate host factors that act in late stages of the viral life
cycle, nor can it identify genes that play important roles in immune modulation and pathogenesis.
It is essential to understand the underlying biology of a disease in order to develop new strategies for
treatment and prevention. For infectious diseases, this entails studying the biology of the pathogen and
the host. We identified complex, interconnected networks of coronavirus host factors and pathways
that are essential for virus infection, nominating hundreds of new host proteins that represent liabilities
for SARS-CoV-2 and potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention. This represents the most
extensive functional catalog of host factors required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal
coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) to date, providing a larger context in which
to interpret ongoing and future large scale CRISPR studies. Future efforts will focus on dissecting the
complex interplay between virus and host and direct medicinal chemistry and drug repurposing
resources toward the most chemically-tractable targets.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmids and sgRNA cloning
To generate stable Cas9-expressing cell lines, we used lentiCas9-Blast (Addgene, cat. #52962). To
express sgRNAs, we used lentiGuidePurov2, a variant of lentiGuide-Puro (Addgene, cat. #52963) that
contains an improved sgRNA scaffold based on Chen et al. 2013 (Chen et al., 2013). For sgRNA
cloning, lentiGuidePurov2 was linearized with BsmBI (NEB) and ligated with BsmBI-compatible
annealed and phosphorylated oligos encoding sgRNAs using high concentration T4 DNA ligase (NEB).
HIV-1 Gag-Pol and VSV-G plasmid sequences are available upon request.
Cell culture
Lenti-X 293T™ cells (H. sapiens; sex: female) obtained from Takara (cat. #632180) and Huh-7.5 cells
(H. sapiens; sex: male) (Blight et al., 2002) were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Fisher Scientific, cat. #11995065) supplemented with 0.1 mM
nonessential amino acids (NEAA, Fisher Scientific, cat. #11140076) and 10% hyclone fetal bovine
serum (FBS, HyClone Laboratories, Lot. #AUJ35777). Both cell lines have tested negative for
contamination with mycoplasma.
Production and titration of coronavirus stocks
SARS-CoV-2 (strain: USA-WA1/2020) and HCoV-NL63 were obtained from BEI Resources (NR-52281
and NR-470). HCoV-OC43 was obtained from ZeptoMetrix (cat. #0810024CF) and HCoV-229E was
generously provided by Volker Thiel (University of Bern). All viruses were amplified at 33 °C in Huh-7.5

cells to generate a P1 stock. To generate working stocks, Huh-7.5 cells were infected at a multiplicity
of infection (MOI) of 0.01 plaque forming unit (PFU)/cell (SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43) and
0.1 PFU/cell (HCoV-229E) and incubated at 33 °C until virus-induced CPE was observed. Supernatants
were subsequently harvested, clarified by centrifugation (3,000 g × 10 min) at 4 dpi (HCoV-229E), 6
dpi (SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43) and 10 dpi (HCoV-NL63), and aliquots stored at -80 °C.
Viral titers were measured on Huh-7.5 cells by standard plaque assay. Briefly, 500 µL of serial 10-fold
virus dilutions in Opti-MEM were used to infect 4 x 105 cells seeded the day prior into wells of a 6-well
plate. After 90 min adsorption, the virus inoculum was removed, and cells were overlaid with DMEM
containing 10% FBS with 1.2% microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel). Cells were incubated for 4 days
(HCoV-229E), 5 days (SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43) and 6 days (HCoV-NL63) at 33 °C, followed by
fixation with 7% formaldehyde and crystal violet staining for plaque enumeration. All SARS-CoV-2
experiments were performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory.
To confirm the identity of the viruses, RNA from 200 µl of each viral stock was purified by adding 800
µl TRIzol™ Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. #15596026) plus 200 µl chloroform then centrifuged
at 12,000 g x 5 min. The upper aqueous phase was moved to a new tube and an equal volume of
isopropanol was added. This was then added to an RNeasy mini kit column (Qiagen, cat. #74014) and
further purified following the manufacturer’s instructions. Viral stocks were confirmed via next
generation sequencing at the NYU Genome Technology Center using an Illumina stranded TruSeq kit
and omitting the polyA selection step. Libraries were then sequenced by MiSeq Micro (2 x 250 bp paired
end reads).
Infection of TMEM41B knockout cells with SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E
Huh-7.5 TMEM41B knockout cells (KO) and their reconstituted (tagRFP-TMEM41B) counterpart were
generated as described in (Hoffmann & Schneider et al., ; see accompanying manuscript). The day

prior to infection, Huh-7.5 WT, TMEM41B KO and reconstituted KO cells were seeded into 96-well
plates at different densities relative to time of fixation e.g., 1x104, 7.5x103 and 5x103 cells/well for a 24,
48, and 72 hours post infection time point, respectively. Cells were infected with the different
coronaviruses under optimal conditions for each virus by directly applying 50 uL of virus inoculum to
each well (n=3) at the following MOIs: SARS-CoV-2: MOI = 0.05 PFU/cell, HCoV-OC43: MOI = 2
PFU/cell, HCoV-NL63: MOI = 0.05 PFU/cell, HCoV-229E: MOI = 0.15 PFU/cell, and incubated for 24
hours at 37 ºC (HCoV-229E), 48 hours at 33 ºC (SARS-CoV-2), and 72 hours at 33 ºC (HCoV-OC43
and HCoV-NL63). Cells were subsequently fixed by adding an equal volume of 7% formaldehyde to
the wells followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes. After extensive washing,
cells were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with blocking solution of 5% goat serum in PBS
(Jackson ImmunoResearch: catalog no. 005–000-121). To stain for SARS-CoV-2, a rabbit polyclonal
anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody (GeneTex: catalog no. GTX135357) was added to the cells
at a 1:1,000 dilution in blocking solution and incubated at 4 °C overnight. To detect infected cells for
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63, a mouse monoclonal anti-dsRNA antibody (Scicons:
catalog no. 10010500) was used under similar conditions. Goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 488 (Life
Technologies: catalog no. A-11012) and goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor 488 (Life Technologies: catalog
no. A-11001) were used as a secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:2,000. Nuclei were stained with
Hoechst 33342 (ThermoFisher Scientific: catalog no. 62249) at a 1:1,000 dilution. Images for
quantification of virus infection and cell viability were acquired with a fluorescence microscope and
analyzed using ImageXpress Micro XLS (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Images for assessment
of tagRFP-TMEM41B subcellular localization were obtained using a Revolve inverted microscope
(Echo, San Diego, CA).

Huh-7.5-Cas9 cells were generated by lentiviral transduction of lentiCas9-Blast (Addgene, cat. #52962)
followed by selection and expansion in the presence of 5 µg/ml blasticidin. The human CRISPR
Brunello library (Doench et al., 2016b) was obtained through Addgene as a ready-to-use lentiviral
pooled library at a titer ≥ 1×107 TU/mL (Addgene, cat. #73178-LV). To deliver the Brunello sgRNA
library, 2.04 x 108 Huh-7.5-Cas9 cells were transduced by spinoculation at 1,000 g x 1 h in media
containing 4 µg/ml polybrene (Millipore, cat. #TR-1003-G) and 20 mM HEPES (Gibco, cat. #15630080)
at a MOI = 0.21 to achieve ~560-fold overrepresentation of each sgRNA. Cells were spinoculated at 3
x 106 cells/well in 12-well plates in 1.5 ml final volume. Six hours post transduction, cells were
trypsinized and transferred to T175 flasks at 7 x 106 cells/flask. Two days later, media was replaced
with fresh media containing 1.5 µg/ml puromycin and cells were expanded for five additional days prior
to seeding for coronavirus infection. Huh-7.5-Cas9 cells transduced with the Brunello sgRNA library
were seeded in p150 plates at 4.5 x 106 cells/plate with two plates per replicate (e.g., 9 x 106 cells) and
three replicates for each condition (mock, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43).
For biosafety reasons, SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed in T175 screw top flasks. For infections
at 37 ºC, we seeded cells at 5 x 106 cells per flask and used two flasks (e.g., 1 x 107 cells) per replicate.
For infections at 33 ºC, we seeded cells at 6.7 x 106 cells per flask and used three flasks (e.g., 2 x 107
cells) per replicate. Both SARS-CoV-2 screens were performed in triplicate. The following day, the
media was removed and viruses diluted in 10 ml/plate OptiMEM were added to cells. The inocula of
HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2 were supplemented with 1 µg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin
(Sigma-Aldrich, cat. #T1426) increasing the rate of infection. After two hours on a plate rocker at 37 ºC,
10 ml/plate media was added and plates were moved to 5% CO2 incubators set to 33 °C (HCoV-229E,
HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and SARS-CoV-2) or 37 ºC (SARS-CoV-2). Coronavirus screens were
performed at the following MOIs in PFU/cell: HCoV-229E = 0.05 at 33 ºC; HCoV-NL63 = 0.01 at 33 °C;
HCoV-OC43 = 1 at 33 °C; SARS-CoV-2 = 0.01 at 33 °C and 0.1 at 37 ºC. Mock cells cultured at both
temperatures were passaged every 3-4 days and re-seeded at 4.5 x 106 cells/plate with two plates per

replicate. Media was changed on virus infected plates as needed to remove cellular debris. Mock cells
and cells that survived coronavirus infection were harvested approximately one to two weeks post
infection.
Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated via ammonium acetate salt precipitation if greater than 1.5 x 106
cells were recovered or using the Monarch Genomic DNA Purification kit (NEB) if fewer per the
manufacturer’s instructions. gDNA concentrations were quantitated via UV spectroscopy and
normalized to 250 ng/µl with 10 mM Tris. The library was amplified from gDNA by a two-stage PCR
approach. For PCR1 amplification, gDNA samples were divided into 50 ul PCR reactions. Each well
consisted of 25 µl of NEB Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix, 2.5 ul of 10 µM forward primer NucPCR1_Nextera-Fwd Mix, 2.5 ul of 10 µM reverse primer Nuc-PCR1_Nextera-Rev Mix and 20 µl of
gDNA (5 µg each reaction). PCR1 cycling settings: initial 30 s denaturation at 98 ºC; then 10 s at 98
ºC, 30 s at 65 ºC, 30 s at 72 ºC for 25 cycles; followed by 2 min extension at 72 ºC. PCR1 samples
were cleaned up by isopropanol precipitation, and normalized to 20 ng/µl. Each PCR2 reaction
consisted of 25 µl of NEB Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix, 2.5 µl 10 µM Common_PCR2_Fwd primer,
and 2.5 ul of 10 µM reverse i7 indexing primer. PCR2 cycling settings: initial 30 s at 98 ºC; then 10 s at
98 ºC, 30 s at 65 ºC, 30 s at 72 ºC for 13 cycles. PCR products were again purified by SPRI, pooled
and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 at the NYU Genome Technology Center using standard
Nextera sequencing primers and 75 cycles.
Analysis of CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen data
FASTQ files were processed and trimmed to retrieve sgRNA target sequences followed by enumeration
of sgRNAs in the reference sgRNA library file using MAGeCK (Li et al., 2014). MAGeCK was also used
to determine gene essentiality (beta) using its maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithm. Zscores for visualization in the form of heatmaps were computed using the following approach: for each
condition, the log2 fold change with respect to the initial condition was computed. A natural cubic spline

with 4 degrees of freedom was fit to each pair of infected and control cells and residuals were extracted.
To obtain gene-wise data, the mean residuals for each group of sgRNAs was calculated, a z-score was
computed, and a p-value was determined using a 2-sided normal distribution test. P-values were
combined across screens using Fisher’s sumlog approach and corrected for multiple testing using the
method of Benjamini & Hochberg.
Functional clustering and network analysis of screening data
High confidence CRISPR hits with FDR cutoffs below 0.05 were extracted for functional clustering and
network building. Briefly, enriched pathways were identified from the NIH NCATS BioPlanet database
(Huang et al., 2019), which aggregates currates pathways from multiple sources, using competitive
gene set testing of z scores in pre-ranked mode (Wu and Smyth, 2012). For construction of the network
in Figure 3, significant CRISPR hits from any virus were searched using the STRING database (stringdb.org) (Szklarczyk et al., 2019) using default parameters and imported into Cytoscape (Shannon et
al., 2003). Overlapping hits per virus were calculated and subsequently depicted as pie charts per node
in Adobe Illustrator. For virus specific networks in Figure S2, significant CRISPR hits per virus and the
next adjacent 100 interactors were extracted and graphed in Cytoscape.

Statistical tests were used as indicated in the figure legends. Generation of plots and statistical analyses
were performed using the R statistical computing environment. Error bars represent standard deviation,
unless otherwise noted. We used Student’s t-test (unpaired, two-tailed) to assess significance between
treatment and control groups, and to calculate P values. P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

FIGURE TITLES AND LEGENDS
Figure 1. Genome-wide CRISPR screens identify host factors required for SARS-CoV-2
infection.
(A) Genome-wide CRISPR screening workflow. Cas9-expressing Huh-7.5 cells are transduced with the
