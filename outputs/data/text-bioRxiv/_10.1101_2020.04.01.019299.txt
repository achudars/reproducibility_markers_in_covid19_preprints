COVID19 disease also known as 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease and has

36

led to the ongoing 2019–20 pandemic COVID19 outbreak. The effective counter

37

measures against SARS-CoV-2 infection require the design and development of

38

specific and effective vaccine candidate. In the present study, we have screened

39

and shortlisted 38 CTL, 33 HTL and 12 B cell epitopes from the eleven Protein

40

sequences of SARS-CoV-2 by utilizing different in silico tools. The screened

41

epitopes were further validated for their binding with their respective HLA allele

42

binders and TAP (Transporter associated with antigen processing) molecule by

43

molecular docking. The shortlisted screened epitopes were further utilized to

44

design novel two multi-epitope vaccines (MEVs) composed of CTL, HTL and B

45

cell epitopes overlaps with potential to elicit humoral as well as cellular immune

46

response against SARS-CoV-2. To enhance the immune response for our

47

vaccine design, truncated (residues 10-153) Onchocerca volvulus activation-

48

associated secreted protein-1 (Ov-ASP-1) has been utilized as an adjuvant at N

49

terminal of both the MEVs. Further molecular models for both the MEVs were

50

prepared and validated for their stable molecular interactions with Toll-Like

51

Receptor 3 (TLR 3). The codon-optimized cDNA of both the MEVs were further

52

analyzed for their potential of high level of expression in a human cell line. The

53

present study is very significant in terms of molecular designing of prospective

54

CTL and HTL vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection with the potential to elicit

55

cellular as well as humoral immune response.

The novel coronavirus (COVID19), officially named as Severe Acute Respiratory

138

Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the ongoing outbreak of a

139

severe form of flu leading to death with a mortality rate of 3.4 %. The SARS-CoV-

140

2 is a novel coronavirus associated with a respiratory disease initiated from the

141

Wuhan of Hubei province, China. The disease is highly contagious and has

142

spread to 182 countries/ Territories since its outbreak in China in December 2019

143

till 21st of March 2020. Worldwide, as of 21st March 2020, the total confirmed

144

cases have been reported to be 2,66,073 and total death count reported is

145

11,184 (WHO Situation report 21st March 2020). Overall the SARS-CoV-2

146

infection has put a global emergency condition. The economic impact of COVID-

147

19 is even harsher and has put the world on economic risk. As of 9th March, the

148

downside scenario sees a $2 trillion shortfall in global income with a $220 billion

epitopes from all the above-mentioned protein and further, we have also

designed and proposed CTL (Cytotoxic T lymphocyte) and HTL (Helper T

Methodology

204

In the present study on SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, we have screened

205

potential epitopes and have designed and proposed two multi-epitope vaccines

206

(MEVs) composed of screened CTL (Cytotoxic T lymphocyte) and HTL (Helper T

207

lymphocyte) epitopes with overlapping regions of B cell epitopes. Hence the

208

proposed MEVs are supposed to have the potential to elicit both the humoral

209

as well as cellular immune response. To enhance immune response, truncated

210

(residues 10-153) Onchocerca volvulus activation-associated secreted protein-1

211

(Ov-ASP-1) has been utilized as an adjuvant at N-terminal of both the MEVs. The

212

truncated Ov-ASP-1 was chosen due to its potential to activate antigen-

213

processing cells (APCs) (MacDonald et al., 2005; Guo et al., 2015; He et al.,

214

2009). All SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus proteins mentioned in the introduction were

215

utilized to screen the potential CTL, HTL and B cell epitopes. The screened

216

epitopes were further studied for overlapping consensus regions amongst them.

217

The epitopes showing overlapping regions in partial or complete were chosen for

218

detailed further studies.

219

The chosen CTL and HTL epitopes were analyzed for their molecular

220

interaction with their respective HLA allele binders. Moreover, the chosen CTL

221

epitopes were also analyzed for their molecular interaction with TAP (Transporter

222

associated with antigen processing) transporter cavity to observe their smooth

223

passage from cytoplasm to endoplasmic reticulum lumen (Oldham et al., 2016;

224

Abele et al., 2004). The tertiary model for both MEVs were generated and

225

refined. Both the MEVs models were further utilized to screened B Cell linear and

226

discontinuous epitopes as well as IFN-γ inducing epitopes.

227

The molecular signaling by multiple TLRs, is an essential component of

228

the innate immune response against SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Since the rOv-

229

ASP-1 primarily binds APCs among human PBMCs and trigger pro-inflammatory

230

cytokine production via Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), hence both the CTL and HTL

231

MEV models were further analyzed for their molecular interaction with the TLR-3

232

by molecular docking studies (Antoniou et al., 2003; Delneste et al., 2007; Totura

233

et al., 2015; Farina et al., 2005). Further, the codon- optimized cDNA of both the

234

MEVs were analyzed to have a high level of expression in mammalian cell line

235

(human), which would facilitate in-vivo expression, experimentation and trials

Screening of Potential Epitopes

266

T cell Epitope Prediction

267

Screening of Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) Epitope. The screening of Cytotoxic

268

T lymphocyte epitopes was performed by the IEDB (Immune Epitope Database)

269

tools “MHC-I Binding Predictions” (http://tools.iedb.org/mhci/) and “MHC-I

270

Processing Predictions” (http://tools.iedb.org/processing/) (Tenzer et al., 2005;

271

Peters et al., 2003; Hoof et al., 2009). Both the tools use six different methods

272

(viz. Consensus, NN-align, SMM-align, Combinatorial library, Sturniolo and

273

NetMHCIIpan) and generate “Percentile rank” and a “total score” respectively.

274

The screening is based on the total amount of cleavage sites in the

275

protein. TAP score estimates an effective log -(IC50) values (half maximal

276

inhibitory concentration (IC50) for binding to TAP of a peptide or its N-terminal

277

prolonged precursors. The MHC binding prediction score is -log(IC50) values for

278

binding to MHC of a peptide (Calis et al., 2013). The IC(50) (nM) value for each

279

epitope and MHC allele binding pairs were also obtained by this IEDB tool.

280

Epitopes having high, intermediate, and least affinity of binding to their HLA allele

281

binders have IC50 values < 50 nM, < 500 nM and < 5000 nM, respectively.

282

Immunogenicity of all the screened CTL epitopes was also obtained by

283

using

284

(http://tools.iedb.org/immunogenicity/) with all the parameters set to default

285

analyzing 1st, 2nd, and C-terminus amino acids of the given screened epitope

286

(Calis et al., 2013). The tool predicts the immunogenicity of a given peptide-MHC

Screening of Helper T lymphocyte (HTL) Epitopes. To screen out the Helper T

293

“Percentile rank” for each potential peptide. The lower the value of percentile,

294

higher would be the affinity. This percentile rank is generated by the combination

295

of three different methods viz. combinatorial library, SMM_align & Sturniolo; and

296

by comparing the score of the peptide against the scores of other random five

297

million 15-mer peptides of SWISSPROT database (Wang et al., 2010; Sidney et

298

al., 2008; Nielsen et al., 2007; Sturniolo et al., 1999). The rank from the

population coverage by the shortlisted 38 CTL and 33 HTL epitopes derived from

305

nine SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Bui et al., 2006). T cells recognize the complex

306

between a specific major MHC molecule and a particular pathogen-derived

307

epitope. The given epitope will elicit a response only in an individual that express

308

an MHC molecule, which is capable of binding that particular epitope. This

309

denominated MHC restriction of T cell responses and the MHC polymorphism

310

provides the basis for population coverage study. The MHC types are expressed

at dramatically different frequencies in different ethnicities. Hence a vaccine with

312

larger population coverage could be of greater importance (Sturniolo et al.,

313

1999). Clinical administration of multiple-epitopes involving both the CTL and the

314

HTL epitopes are predicted here to have a greater probability of larger human

B Cell Epitope Prediction

318

Sequence-based B Cell epitope prediction. Protein sequence-based method

319

“Bepipred Linear Epitope Prediction” was utilized to screen linear B cell epitopes

320

from eleven different SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The tool “B Cell Epitope Prediction

321

Tools” of IEDB server (http://tools.iedb.org/bcell/) was utilized. In this screening,

322

the parameters such as hydrophilicity, flexibility, accessibility, turns, exposed

323

surface, polarity and the antigenic propensity of the polypeptides is correlated

324

with its location in the protein. This allows the search for continuous epitopes

325

prediction from protein sequence. The prediction is base on the propensity scales

326

for each of the 20 amino acids. For a window size n, the i - (n-1)/2 neighboring

327

residues on each side of residue i are used to compute the score for the residue

328

i. The method “Bepipred Linear Epitope Prediction” utilized here is based on the

329

propensity scale method as well as the physiochemical properties of the given

330

antigenic sequence to screen potential epitopes (Larsen et al., 2006).

screened from eleven SARS-CoV-2 proteins were analyzed for the conservancy

335

of their amino acid sequence by “Epitope Conservancy Analysis” tool

336

(http://tools.iedb.org/conservancy/) of IEDB. The epitope conservancy is the

337

number of protein sequences (retrieved from NCBI) that contain that particular

338

epitope. The analysis was done against their entire respective source protein

339

sequences of SARS-CoV-2 proteins retrieved from the NCBI protein database

362

for further analysis. The chosen epitopes are encircled shown in Fig.2. These

363

epitopes were chosen based on partial or full overlapping sequence region

364

amongst all three types of epitopes (CTL, HTL and B Cell). The chosen epitopes

373

of the HLA allele binders were retrieved from Immuno Polymorphism Database

374

(IPD-IMGT/HLA) (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/allele.html). Templates for

375

homology modeling were chosen based on the highest amino acid sequence

376

similarity. All the generated HLA allele models had acceptable QMEAN value

377

(cutoff -4.0) (Supplementary table S1). The QMEAN value gives a composite

388

respective HLA class I and II allele binders (Bell et al., 2005; Duhovny et al.,

391

The algorithm carries out the rigid docking, with the surface variability/flexibility

392

implicitly addressed through liberal intermolecular penetration. The algorithm

393

focuses on the (i) initial molecular surface fitting on localized, curvature-based

MEVs allergenicity and antigenicity prediction. Both the designed MEVs were

478

further analyzed for allergenicity and antigenicity prediction by utilizing the

479

AlgPred (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/algpred/submission.html) and the Vaxigen

480

(http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.html) tools respectively

481

(Saha et al., 2006; Doytchinova and Flower 2007). The AlgPred prediction is

482

based on the similarity of already known epitope with any region of the submitted

483

protein. For the screening of allergenicity, the Swiss-prot dataset consisting of

484

101725 non-allergens and 323 allergens is utilized. The VaxiJen utilizes an

485

alignment-free approach, solely based on the physicochemical properties of the

486

query amino acid sequence. For the prediction of antigenicity, the Bacterial, viral

487

and the tumor protein datasets are used by VaxiJen to derive models for the

488

prediction of whole protein antigenicity. Every set consisted of known 100

489

antigens and 100 non-antigens.

495

sequence-to-structure-to-function paradigm (Roy et al., 2010). The tool

496

generates three-dimensional (3D) atomic models from multiple threading

497

alignments and iterative structural assembly simulations for a submitted amino

498

acid sequence. I-TASSER works based on the structure templates identified by

499

LOMETS, a meta-server, from the PDB library. I-TASSER only uses the

500

templates of the highest Z-score which is the difference between the raw and

501

average scores in the unit of standard deviation. For each target model, the I-

502

TASSER simulations generate a large ensemble of structural conformations,

503

called decoys. To select the final models, I-TASSER uses the SPICKER program

504

to cluster all the decoys based on the pair-wise structure similarity and reports up

505

to five models. The Normalized Z-score >1 mean a good alignment and vice

506

versa. The Cov represents the coverage of the threading alignment and is equal

507

to the number of aligned residues divided by the length of query protein. Ranking

508

of templet proteins is based on TM-score of the structural alignment between the

509

query structure model and known structures. The RMSD is the RMSD between

510

templet residues and query residues that are structurally aligned by TM-align.

The refinement of both the generated MEV models was performed by

514

(Dong et al., 2011). TM-score generated by ModRefiner indicates the structural

to 1, higher would be the similarity of original and the refined model. RMSD value

The GalaxyRefine tool refines the query tertiary structure by repeated

structure perturbation as well as by utilizing the subsequent structural relaxation

521

by the molecular dynamics simulation. The tool GalaxyRefine generates reliable

522

core structures from multiple templates and then re-builds unreliable loops or

523

termini by using an optimization-based refinement method (Ko et al., 2012; Wang

524

et al., 2013; Shin et al., 2014). To avoid any breaks in the 3D model

525

GalaxyRefine uses the triaxial loop closure method. The MolProbity score

generated for a given refined model indicates the log-weighted combination of

an ellipsoid covering 90% of the inner core protein residues score highest

543

Molecular interaction analysis of MEVs with immunological receptor.

550

Molecular docking study of MEVs and TLR-3. Molecular interaction analysis of

551

both the designed MEVs with Toll-Like receptor-3 (TLR-3), was performed by

552

molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation. Molecular docking was

553

performed

554

(Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2005). PatchDock utilizes an algorithm for unbound

555

(mimicking real- world environment) docking of molecules for protein-protein

556

complex formation as explained earlier (Bell et al., 2005; Duhovny et al., 2002).

557

For molecular docking, the 3D structure of human TLR-3 ectodomain (ECD) was

558

retrieved from PDB databank (PDB ID: 2A0Z). The study provides dynamical

559

properties of the designed system with MEVs-TLR3 complexes with a guess at

560

the interactions between the molecules, and also it gives ‘exact’ predictions of

bulk properties including the hydrogen bond formation and conformation of the

MEVs-TLR3 molecular interactions were further evaluated using molecular

565

dynamics simulations analysis. MD simulation studies were performed for 10 ns

566

by using YASARA (Yet Another Scientifc Artifcial Reality Application) (Krieger, E.

567

and Vriend, G., et al., 2015).The simulations were carried out in an explicit water

568

environment in a dodecahedron simulation box at a constant temperature (298K)

569

and pressure (1 atm) and pH 7.4 with periodic cell boundary condition. The

570

solvated systems were neutralized with counter ions (NaCl) (conc. 0.9 M). The

571

AMBER14 force field have been applied on to the systems during simulation

572

(Maier, J.A., et al., 2015; Case, D.A., et al., 2014). Long-range electrostatic

573

energy and forces were calculated using particle-mesh-based Ewald method

574

(Toukmaji, A., et al., 2000). The solvated structures was minimized by the

575

steepest descent method at a temperature of 298K and a constant pressure.

576

Then the complexes were equilibrated for a 1ns period. After equilibration, a

577

production MD was run for 10 ns at a constant temperature and pressure and

578

time frames were saved at every 10 ps for each simulation. The RMSD and

Screening of Helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes. The screening of helper T

627

lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes from eleven different proteins of SARS-CoV-2 was

628

performed based on “Percentile rank”. The smaller the value of percentile rank

629

the higher would be the affinity of the peptide with its respective HLA allele

630

binders. The 33 epitopes with high percentile ranking were shortlisted (Table 2).

631

Another 180 potential HTL cell epitopes-HLA allele II pairs with high Percentile

632

rank, screened in our study are listed in Supplementary table S10.

Table 2. Shortlisted high scoring SARS-CoV-2 HTL epitopes. Selected high scoring
HTL epitopes and their respective HLA alleles binders are listed. In-silico analysis has
shown all the selected epitopes to be non-toxic (Non-Toxin) as well as they show
significant conservancy. Four epitopes shown with ** show exact match with the
epitopes published by Grifoni et al., 2020, indicate consensus in results.

Population Coverage by CTL and HTL epitopes. The population coverage by the

644

shortlisted epitopes was also studied, in particular involving China, France, Italy,

645

United States of America, South Asia, East Asia, Northeast Asia, and the Middle

646

East. From this study, we may conclude that the combined use of all the

647

shortlisted CTL and HTL epitopes would have an average worldwide population

648

coverage as high as 96.10%, with a standard deviation of 23.74 (Table 3).

Table 3. World population coverage by the shortlisted SARS-CoV-2 CTL and HTL
epitopes combined. With a standard deviation of 23.74 on an average 96.10 % of the
world population could be covered by the joint administration of selected CTL and HTL
epitopes (given in Table 1 and 2) as vaccine candidates.

Sequence-based B Cell epitope prediction. To screen B cell epitopes we utilized

696

the Bepipred Linear Epitope Prediction method. In our study, we screened 12 B

697

cell epitopes, from eleven SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which show partial or complete

698

overlap with shortlisted CTL and HTL epitope (Table 4). Another 206 B Cell

699

epitope, with the epitope length of at least four amino acids and maximum 20

700

amino acids were screened and are listed in Supplementary table S11.

MEVs allergenicity and antigenicity prediction. Both the CTL and HTL MEVs

1022

were found to be NON-ALLERGEN by the AlgPred analysis (scoring -

1023

0.95185601 and -1.1293352 respectively; threshold being -0.4). The CTL and

1024

HTL MEVs were also analyzed by VaxiJen to be probable ANTIGENS (prediction

1025

score 0.4485 and 0.4215 respectively; default threshold being 0.4). Hence with

1026

the mentioned analysis tools both the CTL and HTL MEVs are predicted to be

non-allergic as well as potentially antigenic in nature.

Tertiary structure modeling and refinement of MEVs. 3D homology models were

1034

Cov of 0.97, TM-score of 0.916 and RMSD of 1.04 Å).

1035

Both the generated CTL and HTL 3D models were further refined by

1036

ModRefiner to fix any gaps and then followed by GalaxyRefine refinement. The

1037

refinement by ModRefiner showed the TM-score of 0.9189 and 0.9498 for the

1038

CTL and HTL models respectively, hence being close to 1, the initial and the

and acceptable models for both of the MEVs. After refinement, all the mentioned

1049

parameters have found to be improved significantly in comparison to the initial

1050

CTL and HTL MEV models (Supplementary table S3).

Validation of CTL and HTL MEVs refined models. Both the CTL and HTL model

1053

were analyzed by the RAMPAGE analysis tool after refinement. The refined CTL

1054

MEV model was found to have 85.8% residues in favored region, 11.3% residues

1055

in allowed region, and only 3.0% residues in the outlier region; while the refined

1056

HTL MEV model was found to have 88.9% of residues in favored region, 8.9%

1057

residues in allowed region, and only 2.2% residues in the outlier region (Fig.8)

Molecular interaction analysis of MEVs with immunological receptor.

1073

Molecular docking study of MEVs and TLR-3. Both the refined models of CTL

1074

and HTL MEVs were further studied for their molecular interaction with the

1075

ectodomain (ECD) of human TLR-3. Therefore, molecular docking of CTL and

1076

HTL MEVs model with the TLR-3 crystal structure model (PDB ID: 2A0Z) was

1077

performed utilizing the PatchDock tool. Generated docking conformation with the

1078

highest scores of 20776 and 20350 for CTL and HTL MEVs respectively were

1079

chosen for further study. The highest docking score indicates the best geometric

1080

shape complementarity fitting conformation of MEVs and the TLR-3 receptor as

1081

predicted by the PatchDock tool. Both the CTL and HTL MEVs were fitting into

1082

the ectodomain region of TLR-3 after docking (Fig.9A, 9C). The CTL and HTL

1083

MEVs have shown to form multiple hydrogen bonds within the ectodomain cavity

1084

region of TLR-3.

The B-factor analysis of MEVs-TLR3 complexes was also performed. The

1088

the mean position will be (mean-squares displacement) (Fig.9B, 9D). The B-

factor analysis of the CTL and HTL MEVs bound to the TLR3 receptor shows that

1090

most of the regions of MEVs bound to TLR3 are stable nature in nature. The B-

Factor analysis has been represented by the VIBGYOR color presentation with

suggest a stable complex formation tendency for both the CTL and HTL MEVs

revealed that the codon-optimized cDNA of both the CTL and HTL MEVs bear all

30% to 70%, CAI score that indicates the possibility of cDNA expression in a

CONCLUSION

1185

In the present study, we have designed and proposed two multi-epitope

1186

vaccines derived from multiple CTL and HTL epitopes against SARS-CoV-2

1187

(COVID19). The chosen CTL and HTL epitopes show significant sequence

1188

overlap with screened linear B cell epitopes. The shortlisted CTL and HTL

1189

epitopes were utilized to design CTL and HTL multi-epitope vaccine. Both the

1190

generated CTL and HTL multi-epitope vaccine tertiary models have shown to

1191

carry potential linear and discontinuous B cell epitopes as well as potential INF-γ

1192

epitopes. Hence the designed MEVs are predicted to have the potential to elicit

1193

humoral as well as cellular immune responses. Since Onchocerca volvulus

1194

activation-associated secreted protein-1 (Ov-ASP-1) binds to the APCs and

1195

trigger pro-inflammatory cytokine production via Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), the

1196

truncated (residues 10-153) Ov-ASP-1 has been utilized as an adjuvant at N

1197

terminal of both the CTL and HTL MEVs models. Chosen overlapping clustering

1198

epitopes were validated for their molecular interaction with their respective HLA

1199

allele binders by molecular docking studies. The molecular interaction of the

1200

chosen CTL epitopes within the TAP transporter cavity was also analyzed.

1202

and HTL epitopes combined revealed coverage of 96.10% world population. The

1203

molecular interaction analysis of both the CTL and HTL MEVs with the

1204

immunoreceptor TLR3 has shown very convincing structural fitting of the MEVs

1205

into the ectodomain of TLR3 receptor cavity. This result was further confirmed by

1206

the molecular dynamics simulation studies of both the CTL MEV – TLR3 and

1207

HTL MEV – TLR3 complexes, indicating stable molecular complex formation

1208

tendency for both the MEVs in complex with TLR3. The cDNA for both the MEVs

1209

was generated considering codon-biasing for expression in the mammalian host

1210

cell line (Human). Both the cDNA has been optimized in respect of their GC

1211

content and zero tandem rare codons for the cDNA to have high expression

1212

possibility in the mammalian host cell line (Human). Hence for further studies,

1213

both the design of CTL and HTL MEVs could be cloned, expressed and tested

1214

for in-vivo validations and animal trials as potential vaccine candidates against

1215

SARS-CoV-2 infection.
