Summary

22

Monitoring the mutation dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for the development of effective approaches to contain the

23

pathogen. By analyzing 106 SARS-CoV-2 and 39 SARS genome sequences, we provided direct genetic evidence that

24

SARS-CoV-2 has a much lower mutation rate than SARS. Minimum Evolution phylogeny analysis revealed the putative

25

original status of SARS-CoV-2 and the early-stage spread history. The discrepant phylogenies for the spike protein and its

26

receptor binding domain proved a previously reported structural rearrangement prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2.

27

Despite that we found the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is particularly more conserved, we identified a receptor

28

binding domain mutation that leads to weaker ACE2 binding capability based on in silico simulation, which concerns a

29

SARS-CoV-2 sample collected on 27th January 2020 from India. This represents the first report of a significant SARS-

30

CoV-2 mutant, and requires attention from researchers working on vaccine development around the world.

32

Highlights
 Based on the currently available genome sequence data, we provided direct genetic evidence that the SARS-COV-2

33

genome has a much lower mutation rate and genetic diversity than SARS during the 2002-2003 outbreak.

34

 The spike (S) protein encoding gene of SARS-COV-2 is found relatively more conserved than other protein-encoding

35

genes, which is a good indication for the ongoing antiviral drug and vaccine development.

Minimum Evolution phylogeny analysis revealed the putative original status of SARS-CoV-2 and the early-stage



We confirmed a previously reported rearrangement in the S protein arrangement of SARS-COV-2, and propose that

40

this rearrangement should have occurred between human SARS-CoV and a bat SARS-CoV, at a time point much

41

earlier before SARS-COV-2 transmission to human.

43

 We provided first evidence that a mutated SARS-COV-2 with reduced human ACE2 receptor binding affinity have
emerged in India based on a sample collected on 27th January 2020.

Introduction

48

The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused an unprecedented pandemic

49

and severe fatality around the world. As of 4th April 2020, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infection has reached over

50

1.05 million cases globally, claiming 56,985 lives (Coronavirus disease 2019, Situation Report-15, WHO). Most

51

concerning is that this number is predicted to continue to rise significantly in the coming months. Scientists have been

52

working diligently to understand how the virus spreads and evolves. There is an imminent challenge to develop effective

53

approaches to contain the rapid spread of this pathogen.

54
55

In addition to the traditional control methods, such as travel bans and self-isolation, which have clear negative impacts on

56

the economy and disrupt normal social activities, the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines should be the ultimate

57

solution to contain the epidemic and reduce the fatality1,2. Similar to other SARS-like CoVs 3,4, SARS-CoV-2 uses its spike

63

Vaccines utilize the human immune system and is specific to the viral-encoded peptides 10. One of the major concerns for

64

antiviral vaccine development is the constant emergence of new mutations, which may reduce its efficacy in future

65

epidemics 7,10. A prominent example is Influenza virus in which mutations arise every year, requiring annual immunization

66

11

67

initial assessment of the first 9 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences revealed a low level of mutation rate

68

recent studies also highlighted relatively low genetic diversity and stable genomes for SARS-CoV-2 15-17, which suggests

69

that only a single vaccine may be required for SARS-CoV-2. However, these results may be based on limited genomic data

70

in the early stage of virus development. It is critical to study and monitor the mutation dynamics of SARS-COV-2 to gain

71

a more accurate understanding of the virus and therefore guide vaccine development.

73

Taking advantage of the increasing amount of genomic data collected around the world, we set to explore the current status

74

of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity, assess the mutation rate, and potentially identify the emergence of novel mutations that

75

may require close attention. A total of 106 complete or near complete SARS-CoV-2 genome data covering over 12 countries

76

was downloaded from a public database. The genetic diversity profile and evolutionary rate for each protein-encoding gene

77

was characterized. Phylogenetic analyses in this study revealed clues to the spread history of SARS-CoV-2 in some

78

countries. Most importantly, we identified a SARS-CoV-2 mutation with likely reduced human angiotensin-converting

79

enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding affinity. We confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 has a relatively low mutation rate and suggest that

80

novel mutation with likely varied virulence and different immune characteristics may also emerge.

Methods

83

Sequence retrieval

84

The latest sequence data for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS was retrieved from the NCBI public database at

85

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2-seqs/. The 5’UTR, 3’UTR, and CDS sequences of the reference SARS-

86

CoV-2 genome (NC_045512.2) and the human SARS genome (NC_004718.3) were used to blastn against the available

87

genome data. The homology search targets were restricted to the complete or near-complete genomes for further analyses.

88

Conservation profiling

89

The assessment of sequence conservation was performed using the PLOTCON tool from the The European Molecular

90

Biology Open Software Suite at https://www.bioinformatics.nl/cgi-bin/emboss/plotcon. The gene model of SARS-CoV-2

91

was generated using the AnnotationSketch 18 tool based on the genome annotation data downloaded from NCBI database.

92

Phylogeny construction

93

Codon-based sequence alignment was performed for the conserved domain sequences (CDS) using the MUSCLE program

94

(limited to 2 iterations for fast alignment of long sequences)

95

performed separately. The obtained alignment files were concatenated for final phylogeny construction. The phylogenetic

96

tree was developed in MEGA7.0

97

Maximum Likelihood method (HKY+G+I, 500 times bootstrap test) for the S protein analyses. Tree annotation was carried

20

19

. Alignment of the 5’UTR and 3’UTR sequences were

using the Minimum Evolution method with p-distance substitution model, and the

sequences. Then codon-based CDS sequence alignment was performed using the MUSCLE program, and an individual NJ

103

tree was generated using MEGA7.0 20 with p-distance model. The obtained sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree files

104

were used as PAML inputs for dN and dS calculations.

Protein structural analyses

106

3D structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in complex with human ACE2 (PDB: 6VW1) has been determined

107

recently 5,9. The structural model for the receptor binding domain (RBD) was extracted from 6VW1 for comparison analysis

108

with the human SARS structure (PDB: 2AJF) 3, which is in complex with the receptor: human ACE2. Amino acid sequence

118

restraints, refinement of clashing side-chains and minimization of free energy. Prediction of the binding free energy change

119

of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, wild-type and R408I mutant, and the ACE2 receptor interaction was performed

Results

123

Genetic diversity analyses identified a single amino acid mutation in RBD of the spike protein in SARS-CoV-2

124

As of 24th March 2020, there are a total of 174 nucleotide sequences for SARS-CoV-2 in the NCBI database. By restricting

125

to the complete or near-complete genomes, 106 sequences from 12 countries were obtained and used for further analyses.

126

This encompasses 54 records from USA, 35 from China, and the rest from other countries: Australia (1), Brazil (2), Finland

127

(1), India (2), Italy (1), Japan (3), Nepal (1), Spain (3), South Korea (1), and Sweden (1).

128

Based on the gene model of the reference SARS-CoV-2 genome (GeneBank: NC_045512.2), a total of 12 protein-encoding

129

open reading frames (ORFs), plus the 5’UTR and 3’UTR were annotated (Figure 1A). Overall, the gene sequences from

130

different samples are highly homologous, sharing > 99.1% identity, apart from the 5’UTR (96.7%) and 3’UTR (98%)

131

(Table 1), which are relatively more divergent. Sequence alignment showed that there is no mutation in ORF6, ORF7a,

132

and ORF7b. The genetic diversity profile across the 106 genomes was displayed in Figure 1A. A few nucleotide sites

133

within ORF1a, ORF1b, ORF3a, and ORF8 exhibiting high genetic diversity were identified (Figure 1A).

134

The S protein is critical for virus infection and vaccine development. As shown in Figure 1B, 12 single amino acid

135

substitutions in 12 genomes were identified for the spike glycoprotein, only one (R408I) of which occurs in the receptor

136

binding domain (RBD). This mutation concerns an accession collected from Kerala State, India on 27th Jan 2020.

137

To track the occurrence of the R408I mutant, we checked the latest GISAID database (5th Oct 2020) and confirmed that

138

there are a total of 17 SARS-CoV-2 strains containing the R408I mutation (Table 1): England (11), Egypt (2), Portugal (1),

139

Switzerland (1), and India (2). We believe that these numbers are still underestimated by the limited sequencing capacity

140

in respective countries. For example, there are only a total of 152 spike protein records for Egypt in the GISAID database.

141

Noteworthy, the latest R408I SARS-CoV-2 samples were collected on 10th Sep 2020 and 1st Sep 2020 from Switzerland

142

and England (Table 1), respectively, indicating that this mutant is still actively spreading.

SARS-CoV-2 displayed a much lower mutation rate than SARS-CoV, with a highly conserved S gene

154

To assess the mutation rate and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2, the ratio of nonsynonymous mutations (dN) and

155

synonymous mutations (dS) was calculated for each protein-encoding ORF based on the 106 SARS-CoV-2 and 39 SARS

156

genomes. For SARS-CoV-2, the highest dN was observed for ORF8 (0.0111), followed by ORF1a (0.0081), ORF9 (0.0079),

157

and ORF4 (0.0063) (Table 2), indicating these genes may be more likely to accumulate nonsynonymous mutations. In

158

contrast, ORF1b (0.0029), S gene (0.0040) encoding the spike protein, and ORF5 (0.0023) are relatively more conserved

159

in terms of nonsynonymous mutation. Noteworthy, ORF6, ORF7ab and ORF10 are strictly conserved with no

160

nonsynonymous mutation. Compared to SARS-CoV-2, SARS displayed higher mutation rates for all of the ORFs in the

161

virus genome (Table 1), suggesting an overall higher level of genetic diversity and mutation rate. In particular, the dN and

162

dS values for the S gene in SARS-CoV is approximately 12 and 7 times higher than that for SARS-CoV-2, respectively. In

163

contrast, the mutation rate differences for ORF1a and ORF1b between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS are relatively milder,

164

varying from 1.5 times to 4.8 times only. In contrast to SARS-CoV-2, which has strictly conserved ORF6, ORF7a, and

165

ORF7b, SARS displayed mutation rates at different levels. Notably, the dS for ORF10 are comparable between the two

166

genomes at 0.0326 and 0.0341, respectively.

Phylogeny analysis revealed the original status of SARS-CoV-2 and its spread history

172

To trace the potential spread history of SARS-CoV-2 across the world, an unrooted Minimum Evolution (ME) tree of the

173

106 genomes was developed based on whole-genome sequence alignment. The clustering pattern of the ME phylogeny

174

(Figure 2) shed light on how the virus may have spread at the early stage. At the center of the ME tree, a number of virus

175

accessions collected from China (including the reference genome NC_045512.2) and USA have the shortest branch

176

(marked by red and black dots), thus may indicate the original status of SARS-CoV-2. The radial pattern, instead of

177

clustering together, of these accessions and other accessions derived from the tree center (highlighted in yellow color) with

178

longer branches, implies the independent mutations occurring during the virus spread (Figure 2). However, the longer

179

branch may not be always associated with a longer evolution time, as some accessions collected in December 2019 have

180

equal or even longer branch than those collected in January and February 2020.

181

Due to the data availability, virus accessions collected from China and USA are dominant in the ME tree and constantly

182

group with accessions from other countries. Overall, the target SARS-CoV-2 genomes tend to separate into two major

183

clusters (highlighted in yellow dots, Figure 2), suggesting these SARS-CoV-2 may have originated from two major spread

184

sources. Of particular interest is the observation of several phylogenetic clades encompassing samples collected from more

185

than one country, which may provide clues to track the spread history of SARS-CoV-2 in these countries. For example, a

186

notable clade (clade a) containing accessions collected from USA, Brazil, Italy, Australia, Sweden, and South Korea was

187

identified. The only Brazil accession (MT126808.1) in this study is found to be clustered with one accession from USA

(MT163716.1) with strong support. Whilst the virus accessions from China are prevalent in the ME tree, it is intriguing

189

that no correlated accession from China is found in this clade. An additional clade including accessions collected from

190

China, USA and Finland were found together (clade b). In another notable clade (clade c), 2 of the 3 accessions

191

(LC528232.1 and LC528233.1) collected from the cruise ship in Japan were grouped with several accessions from USA.

192

Two accessions (MT198651.1 and MT198652.1) collected in March 2020 from Spain were grouped (clade f) with one

193

accession collected in January 2020 from China. The additional Spain accession (MT198653.1) was clustered with one

194

from USA (MT192765.1). One India accession (MT012098.1) was found together (clade g) with an accession from Wuhan,

195

China, collected in December 2019. Interestingly, the single Nepal accession (MT072688.1) seems to be closely related

196

(clade d) to several accessions from USA.

203

Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has undergone a structural rearrangement

204

The spike glycoprotein is critical for virus infection. Recent study suggested that the S protein in SARS-CoV-2 may have

205

undergone a structural rearrangement13. To investigate this hypothesis, two separate phylogenies were developed based on

206

the full-S and RBD sequences, respectively. Human SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and SARS-CoV reference sequences and their

207

close coronavirus homologues identified from various animal hosts were included for the phylogenetic analyses. Overall,

208

the two phylogenies displayed similar clustering patterns, separating into three major clades (Figure 3). SARS-CoV-2 was

209

identified in the same major clade and was clustered most closely with two bat SARS CoVs (highlighted in purple and

210

green colors, Figure 3) and the human SARS-CoV (orange color, Figure 3). In both phylogenies, SARS-CoV-2 is most

211

closely related to bat_CoV_RaTG13, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 may have originated from bat. However, the evolutionary

212

positions of human SARS-CoV and bat-SL-CoVZ45 were swapped between the full-S and RBD-only phylogenies. In the

213

full-S phylogeny, bat-SL-CoVZ45 is relatively more similar to human SARS-CoV-2, whilst human SARS-CoV is closer

214

to SARS-CoV-2 than bat-SL-CoVZ45. Taken together, these results suggested that the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is more likely

215

originated from human SARS-CoV, whilst the remaining part of the S protein in SARS-CoV-2 may have originated from

216

bat-SL-CoVZ45, supporting the potential structural rearrangement of S protein in SARS-CoV-2. bat_CoV_RaTG13 is

217

similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating the proposed structural rearrangement may have occurred in bat first before its

218

transmission to human.

A single amino acid mutation in RBD results in reduced receptor binding affinity on human ACE2

225

The RBD of virus S protein binds to a receptor in host cells, and is responsible for the first step of CoV infection 3. Thus,

226

amino acid mutation to RBD may have significant impact on receptor binding and vaccine development. The 3D structure

227

of the spike protein RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB: 6VW1) has recently been determined in complex with human ACE2

228

receptor 6. One of the 12 spike protein mutations identified above (Figure 1B) was located in the RBD region (R408I).

229

Further data screening against the latest GISAID and NCBI database (5 th Oct) revealed a total of 17 strains from five

230

countries containing the R408I mutation (Table 1). Sequence alignment showed that 408R is strictly conserved in SARS-

231

CoV-2, SARS-CoV and bat SARS-like CoV (Figure 4A). Based on the determined CoV2_RBD-ACE2 complex structure,

232

408R is located at the interface between RBD and ACE2, but is positioned relatively far away from ACE2 and thus does

233

not have direct interaction with ACE2 (Figure 4B). However, the determined RBD0-ACE2 structure showed that 408R

234

forms a hydrogen bond (3.3 Å in length) with the glycan attached to 90N from ACE2 (Figure 4C) 6. The hydrogen bond

235

may have contributed to the exceptionally higher ACE2 binding affinity. The arginine residue is also conserved in human

236

SARS-CoV (corresponding to 395R in PDB: 2AJF), but is positioned relatively distant (6.1 Å) from the glycan bound to

237

90N from ACE2 (Figure S1). Interestingly, the 408R-glycan hydrogen bond appears to be disrupted by the R408I mutation

238

in one SARS-CoV-2 accession (GeneBank ID: MT012098.1) (Figure 4D), collected from India on 27th Jan 2020. In silico

239

calculations indicatethat the R408I mutation increased the binding free energy by 0.93 kcal/mol, predicting a modest

240

decrease in ACE2-binding affinity. In contrast to the electrically charged and highly hydrophilic arginine residue, the

241

mutated isoleucine residue has a highly hydrophobic side chain with no hydrogen-bond potential (Figure 4E). In summary,

242

the R408I mutation identified from the SARS-CoV-2 strain in India represents a SARS-CoV-2 mutant with likely lower

243

ACE2 binding affinity.

Discussions

253

Based on the currently available genome sequence data, our results showed that the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is much

254

lower than that for SARS, which caused the 2002-2003 outbreak. Our study is the first to provide a direct gene-based

255

quantitative comparison between SARS-COV-2 and SARS. Among the different genetic regions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes,

256

we found that the spike protein (S) is more conserved that other genetic regions such as ORF1, ORF8, and N, which encode

257

nonstructural polyprotein, virus accessory protein, and the nucleocapsid protein, respectively. A relatively stable spike

258

protein region of SARS-CoV-2 is a good indication for the epidemic control, as less mutation raises the hope of the rapid

259

development of a vaccine and antiviral drugs. Our results are consistent with several recent genetic variance analyses on

260

SARS-CoV-2

261

latest genomic data for SARS-CoV-2, molecular geneticists monitoring the virus development also suggested that the

262

mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 maintains at a low level 17,26,27. Whilst it is generally safe to say that SARS-CoV-2 tends to

263

mutate at a low rate, as the virus continues to spread rapidly around the world, and more genomic data is accumulated, the

264

evolution and mutation dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 still need to be monitored closely.

15,23-25

, which suggested the SARS-CoV-2 genomes are highly homogeneous. Furthermore, based on the

265
266

One critical aim of our study is to identify the original status of SARS-CoV-2 before its wide transmission across different

267

countries. Due to the short time space of sample collection and a relatively low mutation rate for SARS-CoV-2, we believe

268

that Minimum Evolution phylogeny (a parsimony method) may outperform other phylogenetic methods to achieve this

269

aim. Similarly, Peter et al.

270

SARS-CoV-2 in the early stage of the pandemic. Minimum Evolution and Maximum Parsimony are similar phylogeny

271

methods (both using the parsimony sites detected in the sequence alignment) trying to minimize the total number of

272

substitutions in the phylogenetic tree. In our analysis, the earliest few reported SARS-CoV-2 accessions collected from

273

Wuhan China were identified at the center of the phylogenetic tree with the shortest branch. Interestingly, several virus

274

genomes from USA were found to be identical to these putative original versions of the virus from Wuhan. According to

275

public media, the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in USA occurred relatively later than other countries. One possible explanation

276

for this observation is that, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in USA might start much earlier than previously thought or reported.

277

Since a dominant proportion of the samples in this study were collected from China and USA, we observed a significantly

278

higher level of genetic diversity from these two countries. Most SARS-CoV-2 accessions from the other countries can find

279

their closely related sisters from either China or USA. This data bias, on the other hand, may give us an advantage to trace

280

the spread history of SARS-CoV-2 in different countries. This suggestion is reliable because all samples investigated in

281

this study were collected at the early stage of the pandemic, which may avoid the potential data noise caused by recent

282

published genomes of complex spread background. One notable finding in our phylogenetic tree is that, the singleton

283

SARS-CoV-2 accessions collected from Australia, Brazil, South Korea, Italy and Sweden were clustered together with two

28

also adopted a parsimony phylogeny (Maximum Parsimony) to trace the spread history of

284

USA samples but without a Chinese version, suggesting that these infection cases may be somehow related. In addition,

285

one of the three samples collected from the cruise ship stranded in Japan was found to be closely related to a sample

286

collected from Guangzhou, China, whilst the other two were grouped with several cases from USA. Noteworthy, our

287

phylogeny seems to support the presence of two major types of SARS-CoV-2 in the target samples, suggesting the potential

288

existence of two spread sources. Interestingly, this speculation is corroborated by an independent clustering analyses using

289

a different phylogeny method 23.

290
291

Until now, the origin of SARS-CoV-2, and how it has been transmitted to humans remains largely a mystery. Early genomic

292

data indicated that human SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense, and single-stranded RNA virus in the subgenus

293

Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus

294

CoV (88% genome sequence identity) and human SARS CoV (79%), the latter of which caused a global pandemic in 2003

295

13

296

speculated that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated from bat 14,29. However, a more recent study proposed that pangolin may

297

be the most likely reservoir hosts due to the identification of closely related SARS-COVs from this species as well 30. Both

298

animals can harbor coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2. However, direct evidence of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2

299

from either bat or pangolin to human is still missing.

13,14

. Evolutionarily, SARS-CoV-2 is most closely related to bat SARS-like

. Based on the strong genome sequence identity between SARS-CoV-2 and bat SARS-like COVs, it was initially

300
301

Prior to this study, several publications have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated from the genome

302

recombination of SARS-like CoVs from different animal hosts, as evidenced by the discrepant clustering patterns for the

303

phylogenies using different genetic regions. Lu 13 first observed that the RBD of S protein in SARS-CoV-2 is more closely

304

related to human SARS-CoV, whilst the other part of its genome is more similar to bat SARS-CoV. Later Lam 30 identified

305

a bat CoV_RaTG13 and several pangolin SARS-CoVs that are consistently closer to SARS-CoV-2 than human SARS-

306

CoV in either full-S protein or RBD. By combining the data from these two studies, our study confirmed the observations

307

reported in both studies, and further determined that the S protein recombination actually happened between human SARS-

308

CoV and a bat SARS-CoV, much earlier before its transmission to human, with the newly identified bat SARS-CoV-

309

RaTG13 as an intermediate.

311

The RBD of S protein binds to a receptor in host cells and is responsible for the first step of CoV infection. The receptor

312

binding affinity of RBD directly affects virus transmission rate. Thus, it has been the major target for antiviral vaccine and

313

therapeutic development such as SARS 8. At the time of first completion in late March 2020, this study was the first to

314

report the identification of the R408I mutation in the RBD of S protein in SARS-CoV-2. Since then, the R408I mutant has

315

attracted research attention from a significant number of researchers. Both computational and experimental studies have

316

been performed to further investigate its molecular characteristics and potential immune effects

317

commercial synthesis of the R408I recombinant RBD protein has been offered by serval companies (Acro Biosystems,

318

Creative Dianostics, SinoBiological, and Creative Biolabs) for immuno-binding and diagnostic testing. Noteworthy, Yan

319

et al. 31 showed that three of the four RBD neutralizing antibodies tested could not bind the R408I mutant, whereas other

320

mutants displayed strong binding interaction with all the neutralizing antibodies tested. The authors stated that 408R played

321

an essential role for SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody binding and the R408I could abolish the antibody binding interaction 31.

322

In addition, Zhe et al.

323

early stage study 17 which did not notice the R408I mutation and predicted that a single vaccine may be sufficient for all

324

circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant. Based on the determined RBD-hACE2 protein structure (PDB: 6VW1) 6, we found that

325

408R residue can establish an indirect receptor interaction via a glycan attached to human ACE2. This residue was found

326

to be conserved in SARS and MERS as well. Interestingly, the arginine residue (corresponding to 395R in SARS) has also

327

been shown to be involved in receptor interaction in SARS. In this study, we were the first to show that the R408I mutation

328

in SARS-CoV-2 is likely to cause a reduced binding affinity to human ACE2 receptor. Our result has been corroborated in

329

several independent studies later on 32-34. Although the S protein gene seems to be more conserved than the other protein-

330

encoding genes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, our study provides direct evidence that a mutated version of SARS-CoV-2 S

331

protein with varied transmission rate may have already emerged. Furthermore, we confirmed that, as of 5th Oct 2020, a

332

total of 17 SARS-CoV-2 strains containing the R408I mutation were present in the GISAID and NCBI databases, with the

333

latest R408I mutants collected on 10th Sep 2020 and 1st Sep 2020 from Switzerland and England, respectively. These results

334

suggest that the R408I mutant may spread across to different countries since its first emergence from India and is still

335

actively spreading in different regions. Benson et al.40 recently reported that R408I accounts for ~2% of infection cases in

39

31-38

. In addition,

also suggested that R408I constitute the RBD epitope residues. These observations contrast an

336

Africa. We believe that the number of identified R408I mutants are still underestimated, given the limited sequencing

337

capability in respective countries. Based on the close relationship of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS, current vaccine and drug

338

development for SARS-CoV-2 has also focused on the S protein and its human binding receptor ACE2

339

the significantly varied antibody binding profile for R408I, we propose that this mutant still requires significant attention

340

from doctors and scientists around the world during the development of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic solutions. One suggestion

341

for the next step of therapeutic development is to focus on the identification of potential human ACE2 receptor blocker, as

342

suggested in a recent commentary 7. This approach will avoid the above-mentioned challenge faced by vaccine

development.
