ABSTRACT

2

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has led to accelerated

3

efforts to develop therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccines to mitigate this public health

4

emergency. A key target of these efforts is the spike (S) protein, a large trimeric class I fusion

5

protein that is metastable and difficult to produce recombinantly in large quantities. Here, we

6

designed and expressed over 100 structure-guided spike variants based upon a previously

7

determined cryo-EM structure of the prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike. Biochemical, biophysical

8

and structural characterization of these variants identified numerous individual substitutions that

9

increased protein yields and stability. The best variant, HexaPro, has six beneficial proline

10

substitutions leading to ~10-fold higher expression than its parental construct and is able to

11

withstand heat stress, storage at room temperature, and multiple freeze-thaws. A 3.2 Å-resolution

12

cryo-EM structure of HexaPro confirmed that it retains the prefusion spike conformation. High-

13

yield production of a stabilized prefusion spike protein will accelerate the development of

14

vaccines and serological diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2.

INTRODUCTION

16

Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses containing positive-sense RNA genomes. Four human

17

coronaviruses generally cause mild respiratory illness and circulate annually. However, SARS-

18

CoV and MERS-CoV were acquired by humans via zoonotic transmission and caused outbreaks

19

of severe respiratory infections with high case-fatality rates in 2002 and 2012, respectively1,2.

20

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel betacoronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and

21

is the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic3,4. As of May 26, 2020, the WHO has

22

reported over 5 million cases and 350,000 deaths worldwide. Effective vaccines, therapeutic

23

antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors are urgently needed, and the development of these

24

interventions is proceeding rapidly.

25

Coronavirus virions are decorated with a spike (S) glycoprotein that binds to host-cell

26

receptors and mediates cell entry via fusion of the host and viral membranes5. S proteins are

27

trimeric class I fusion proteins that are expressed as a single polypeptide that is subsequently

28

cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits by cellular proteases6,7. The S1 subunit contains the receptor-

29

binding domain (RBD), which, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, recognizes the angiotensin-

30

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the host-cell surface8–10. The S2 subunit mediates

31

membrane fusion and contains an additional protease cleavage site, referred to as S2′, that is

32

adjacent to a hydrophobic fusion peptide. Binding of the RBD to ACE2 triggers S1 dissociation,

33

allowing for a large rearrangement of S2 as it transitions from a metastable prefusion

34

conformation to a highly stable postfusion conformation6,11. During this rearrangement, the

35

fusion peptide is inserted into the host-cell membrane after cleavage at S2′, and two heptad

36

repeats in each protomer associate to form a six-helix bundle that brings together the N- and C-

37

termini of the S2 subunits as well as the viral and host-cell membranes. Attachment and entry are

38

essential for the viral life cycle, making the S protein a primary target of neutralizing antibodies

39

and a critical vaccine antigen12,13.

40

A stabilized prefusion conformation of class I fusion proteins is desirable for vaccine

41

development because this conformation is found on infectious virions and displays most or all of

42

the neutralizing epitopes that can be targeted by antibodies to prevent the entry process14–16. We

43

and others have observed that prefusion stabilization tends to increase the recombinant

44

expression of viral glycoproteins, possibly by preventing triggering or misfolding that results

45

from a tendency to adopt the more stable postfusion structure. For example, structure-based

46

design of prefusion-stabilized MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV spike ectodomains resulted in

47

homogeneous preparations of prefusion spikes and greatly increased yields15. These variants (S-

48

2P) contained two consecutive proline substitutions in the S2 subunit in a turn between the

49

central helix (CH) and heptad repeat 1 (HR1) that must transition to a single, elongated α-helix in

50

the postfusion conformation. Prefusion-stabilized spike variants are also superior immunogens to

51

wild-type spike ectodomains15, and have been used to determine high-resolution spike structures

52

by cryo-EM17–20. Importantly, the successful transplantation of this double-proline substitution

53

into the SARS-CoV-2 spike (SARS-CoV-2 S-2P) allowed for the rapid determination of high-

54

resolution cryo-EM structures and accelerated development of vaccine candidates21,22. However,

55

even with these substitutions, the SARS-CoV-2 S-2P ectodomain is unstable and difficult to

56

produce reliably in mammalian cells, hampering biochemical research and development of

57

subunit vaccines.

58

Here, we employ structure-based design to increase the yield and stability of the SARS-

59

CoV-2 spike ectodomain in the prefusion conformation. We report multiple prolines, disulfide

60

bonds, salt bridges, and cavity-filling substitutions that increase expression and/or stability of the

61

spike relative to the S-2P base construct. Combining four proline substitutions into a single

62

construct, termed HexaPro, stabilized the prefusion state and increased expression 10-fold. A

63

high-resolution cryo-EM structure of this variant confirms that the proline substitutions adopt the

64

designed conformations and do not disrupt the conformation of the S2 subunit, thus preserving

65

its antigenicity. This work will facilitate production of prefusion spikes for diagnostic kits and

66

subunit vaccines, and has broad implications for next-generation coronavirus vaccine design.

RESULTS

68

Structure-based design of prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spikes

69

To generate a prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that expresses at higher levels and

70

is more stable than our original S-2P construct21 we analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 S-2P cryo-EM

71

structure (PDB ID: 6VSB) and designed substitutions based upon knowledge of class I fusion

72

protein function and general protein stability principles. These strategies included the

73

introduction of disulfide bonds to prevent conformational changes during the pre-to-postfusion

74

transition, salt bridges to neutralize charge imbalances, hydrophobic residues to fill internal

75

cavities, and prolines to cap helices or stabilize loops in the prefusion state. We cloned 100

76

single S-2P variants and characterized their relative expression levels (Table S1), and for those

77

that expressed well we characterized their monodispersity, thermostability, and quaternary

78

structure. Given that the S2 subunit undergoes large-scale refolding during the pre-to-postfusion

79

transition, we exclusively focused our efforts on stabilizing S2. Substitutions of each category

80

were identified that increased expression while maintaining the prefusion conformation (Fig. 1

81

and 2A). Overall, 26 out of the 100 single-substitution variants had higher expression than S-2P

82

(Table S1).

Single-substitution spike variants

84

One common strategy to stabilize class I fusion proteins, such as the spike, is to covalently link a

85

region that undergoes a conformational change to a region that does not via a disulfide bond. For

86

instance, the Q965C/S1003C substitution attempts to link HR1 to the central helix, whereas

87

G799C/A924C aims to link HR1 to the upstream helix. These two variants boosted protein

88

expression 3.8-fold and 1.3-fold compared to S-2P, respectively (Fig. 2B). However, the size-

89

exclusion chromatography (SEC) traces of both variants showed a leftward shift compared to S-

90

2P, indicating that the proteins were running larger than expected, which agreed well with

91

negative stain electron microscopy (nsEM) results that showed partially misfolded spike particles

92

(Fig. S1). In contrast, S884C/A893C and T791C/A879C variants eluted on SEC at a volume

93

similar to S-2P and were well-folded trimeric particles by nsEM (Fig. 2E). These variants link

94

the same α-helix to two different flexible loops that pack against a neighboring protomer (Fig.

95

1). Notably, S884C/A893C had two-fold higher expression than S-2P with increased

96

thermostability (Fig. 2F).

97

Cavity-filling substitutions and salt bridges can also enhance protein stability without

98

disturbing the overall fold. Cavity filling has been particularly helpful in stabilizing the prefusion

99

conformations of RSV F and HIV-1 Env23,24. We found many cavity-filling and salt bridge

100

designs that improved protein expression compared to S-2P (Fig. 2G). For example, L938F and

101

T961D both produced ~2-fold increases in protein yield and maintained the correct quaternary

102

structure (Fig. 2C and 2E), although the thermostability of both variants as assessed by

103

differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) was unchanged compared to S-2P (Fig. 2F).

104

Previous successes using proline substitutions inspired us to investigate 14 individual

105

variants wherein a proline was substituted into flexible loops or the N-termini of helices in the

106

fusion peptide, HR1, and the region connecting them (CR) (Table 1 and Fig. 1G). As expected,

107

multiple proline variants boosted the protein expression and increased the thermostability (Fig.

108

2D and 2F). Two of the most successful substitutions, F817P and A942P, exhibited 2.8 and 6.0-

109

fold increases in protein yield relative to S-2P, respectively. The A942P substitution further

110

increased the melting temperature (Tm) by ~3 °C, and both variants appeared as well-folded

111

trimers by nsEM (Fig. 2E and Fig. S2).

112

Multi-substitution spike variants

113

We next generated combination (“Combo”) variants that combined the best-performing

114

modifications from our initial screen. The Combo variants containing two disulfide bonds

115

generally expressed 2-fold lower than the single-disulfide variants, suggesting that they

116

interfered with each other (Table S2). Adding one disulfide (S884C/A893C) to a single proline

117

variant (F817P) also reduced the expression level, although the quaternary structure of the spikes

118

was well maintained (Table S2, Combo40). The beneficial effect of a disulfide bond was most

119

prominent when combined with L938F, a cavity-filling variant. Combo23 (S884C/A893C,

120

L938F) had higher protein yields than either of its parental variants, but the Tm of Combo23 did

121

not increase compared to S884C/A893C (Fig. S3B). In addition, mixing one cavity-filling

122

substitution with one proline substitution (Combo20) increased the expression compared to

123

L938F alone (Table S2).

124

Combining multiple proline substitutions resulted in the most drastic increases in

125

expression and stability (Fig. 3A). Combo14, containing A892P and A942P, had a 6.2-fold

126

increase in protein yield compared to A892P alone (Fig. 3B and 3C). Adding a third proline,

127

A899P, increased thermostability (+1.2 °C Tm) but did not further increase expression (Fig. 3C).

128

Combo46 (A892P, A899P, F817P) had a 3.4-fold increase in protein yield and a 3.3 °C rise in

129

Tm as compared to A892P. The most promising variant, Combo47, renamed HexaPro, contains

130

all four beneficial proline substitutions (F817P, A892P, A899P, A942P) as well as the two

131

proline substitutions in S-2P. HexaPro expressed 9.8-fold higher than S-2P, had ~5 °C increase

132

in Tm, and retained the trimeric prefusion conformation (Fig. 3D, Fig. S2). We focused on this

133

construct for additional characterization.

134

HexaPro large-scale expression and stress testing

135

To assess the viability of HexaPro as a potential vaccine antigen or diagnostic reagent, we

136

comprehensively examined large-scale production in FreeStyle 293-F cells, the feasibility of

137

protein expression in ExpiCHO cells, epitope integrity and protein stability. We were able to

138

generate ~14 mg of HexaPro from 2L of FreeStyle 293-F cells, or 7 mg/L, which represents a

139

greater than 10-fold improvement over S-2P21. Importantly, large-scale HexaPro preparations

140

retained a monodisperse SEC peak corresponding to the molecular weight of a glycosylated

141

trimer (Fig. 4A) and were indistinguishable from S-2P by nsEM (Fig. 4B). Industrial production

142

of recombinant proteins typically relies on CHO cells rather than HEK293 cells. We thus

143

investigated HexaPro expression in ExpiCHO cells via transient transfection. ExpiCHO cells

144

produced 1.3 mg of well-folded protein per 40 mL of culture, or 32.5 mg/L (Fig. 4C and 4D).

145

The binding kinetics of HexaPro to the human ACE2 receptor were comparable to that of S-2P

146

(Fig. 4E and 4F), with affinities of 13.3 nM and 11.3 nM, respectively. HexaPro remained

147

folded in the prefusion conformation after 3 cycles of freeze-thaw, 2 days incubation at room

148

temperature or 30 minutes at 55 °C (Fig. 4G and 4H). In contrast, S-2P showed signs of

149

aggregation after 3 cycles of freeze-thaw, and began unfolding after 30 min at 50 °C.

150

Collectively, these data indicate that HexaPro is a promising candidate for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine

151

development.

152

Cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 S HexaPro

153

To confirm that our stabilizing substitutions did not lead to any unintended conformational

154

changes, we determined the cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 S HexaPro. From a single

155

dataset, we were able to obtain high-resolution 3D reconstructions for two distinct conformations

156

of S: one with a single RBD in the up conformation and the other with two RBDs in the up

157

conformation. This two-RBD-up conformation was not observed during previous structural

158

characterization of SARS-CoV-2 S-2P21,22. While it is tempting to speculate that the enhanced

159

stability of S2 in HexaPro allowed us to observe this less stable intermediate, validating this

160

hypothesis will require further investigation. Roughly a third (30.6%) of the particles were in the

161

two-RBD-up conformation, leading to a 3.20 Å reconstruction. The remaining particles were

162

captured in the one-RBD-up conformation, although some flexibility in the position of the

163

receptor-accessible RBD prompted us to remove a subset of one-RBD-up particles that lacked

164

clear density for this domain, resulting in a final set of 85,675 particles that led to a 3.21 Å

165

reconstruction (Fig. 5A, Fig. S4 and Fig. S5). Comparison of our one-RBD-up HexaPro

166

structure with the previously determined 3.46 Å S-2P structure revealed an RMSD of 1.2 Å over

167

436 Cα atoms in S2 (Fig. 5B). The relatively high resolution of this reconstruction allowed us to

168

confirm that the stabilizing proline substitutions did not distort the S2 subunit conformation (Fig.

169

5C).

170

DISCUSSION

171

Prefusion-stabilized class I viral fusion proteins generally induce more potent neutralizing

172

antibodies and function as better vaccine antigens than their unstabilized counterparts14–16. To

173

respond to the urgent need for preventative countermeasures against the COVID-19 pandemic,

174

we used our prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 S-2P structure21 as a guide to design 100 single

175

substitution variants intended to have increased expression or stability. We focused on

176

engineering the S2 subunit because it undergoes large-scale refolding to facilitate membrane

177

fusion. One of the strategies we employed was the introduction of disulfide bonds wherein at

178

least one cysteine is in a region that changes conformation between the pre- and postfusion

179

states. Although this method has been successful in the case of HIV-1 Env (SOSIP) and RSV F

180

(DS-Cav1)14,23, the disulfides we introduced into S2 generally had detrimental effects. For

181

example, inter-subunit disulfides (e.g. S659C/S698C) decreased the protein expression by 60%

182

(Table S1), and the Q965C/S1003C substitution led to partially mis-folded spikes (Fig. 2B).

183

Inter-protomer disulfides have been shown to improve the trimer integrity of HIV-1 Env and the

184

stability of RSV F25,26, but the inter-protomeric T961C/S758C substitution ablated expression

185

(Table S1). In contrast, we found that stabilizing the flexible loops located in the protomer

186

interfaces was beneficial. Both S884C/A893C and T791C/A879C increased thermostability or

187

expression and resulted in native trimer structures. It is possible that anchoring flexible loops to a

188

relatively rigid α-helix favors protomer assembly.

189

Introducing a salt bridge at the HIV-1 gp120–gp41 interface not only boosted the protein

190

expression but also enhanced the binding of trimer-specific antibodies, suggesting improved

191

retention of the native quaternary structure24. Based on a similar principle, the T961D

192

substitution was introduced to form an electrostatic interaction with Arg765 from a neighboring

193

protomer (Fig. 1). Likewise, the G769E substitution was designed to form an inter-protomeric

194

salt bridge with Arg1014. Both variants increased expression and resembled well-folded trimeric

195

spikes (Fig. 2E, Fig. S2, Table S1). In addition to salt bridges, filling loosely packed

196

hydrophobic cores that allow the protein to refold can help stabilize the prefusion state, as shown

197

by previous cavity-filling substitutions in RSV F and HIV-1 Env14,23,27. Here, the L938F

198

substitution was designed to fill a cavity formed in part by HR1, the FP and a β-hairpin (Fig. 1).

199

This variant had a 2-fold increase in expression (Fig. 2C) and appeared to have additive effects

200

when paired with disulfide or proline substitutions (Table S2).
Among the best single-substitution variants we discovered were F817P and A942P (Fig

201
202

2). By further combining them with A892P and A899P substitutions, we generated the highest

203

expressing construct, HexaPro. This result is reminiscent of previous successful applications of

204

proline substitutions to class I fusion proteins including HIV-1 Env, influenza HA, RSV F,

205

hMPV F, MERS-CoV S, Lassa GPC and Ebola GP14,15,23,28–31. Solvent accessibility of

206

hydrophobic residues near the fusion peptide was a concern for influenza HA stem-only

207

designs32, and similarly we addressed this issue by replacing the exposed Phe817 with Pro (Fig.

208

5C). The A942P substitution imposes rigidity to the flexible loop between the connector region

209

and HR1, and is similar to that of the T577P substitution found to be helpful for stabilizing Ebola

210

GP28.

211

In our HexaPro cryo-EM dataset we observed a third of the particles in a two-RBD-up

212

conformation. This had not been previously observed for SARS-CoV-2 spikes until a recent

213

structure was determined of a modified spike containing four hydrophobic substitutions that

214

brought subdomain 1 closer to S233. We hypothesize that the more stable S2 in HexaPro allowed

215

us to capture this relatively unstable conformation that may transiently exist prior to triggering

216

and dissociation of S1. This is similar to what was observed in the structures of the MERS-CoV

217

S-2P spike, where even the 3-RBD-up conformation could be observed15. Additionally, HexaPro

218

spikes were able to retain the prefusion state after freeze-thaws, room temperature storage, and

219

heat stress, which should aid in the development of HexaPro spikes as subunit vaccine antigens.

220

HexaPro spikes may also improve DNA or mRNA-based vaccines by producing more antigen

per nucleic acid molecule, thus improving efficacy at the same dose or maintaining efficacy at

222

lower doses. Finally, we demonstrate that 32 mg of well-folded HexaPro can be obtained from

223

1L of ExpiCHO cells, indicating a clear path to industrial-level production to meet global

224

demand for this essential SARS-CoV-2 protein.

308

Design scheme for prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike variants

309

The SARS-CoV-2 S-2P variant was used as the base construct for all subsequent designs21. The

310

S-2P base construct comprises residues 1-1208 of SARS-CoV-2 S (GenBank: MN908947) with

311

prolines substituted at residues 986 and 987, “GSAS” substituted at the furin cleavage site

312

(residues 682–685), and C-terminal foldon trimerization motif, HRV3C protease recognition site,

313

Twin-Strep-tag and octa-histidine tag cloned into the mammalian expression plasmid pαH. Using

314

this plasmid as a template, desired mutations were introduced at selected positions within the

315

SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit. Based on SARS-CoV-2 S-2P cryo-EM structure (PDB ID: 6VSB),

316

pairs of residues with Cβ atoms less than 4.6 Å apart were considered for disulfide bond designs.

317

We particularly targeted the regions that move drastically during the pre- to postfusion transition

318

such as the fusion peptide, connector region and HR1. Salt bridge variants required that the

319

charged groups of the substituted residues were predicted to be within 4.0 Å. For residues in

320

loops, a slightly longer distance than 4.0 Å was allowed. Core-facing residues with sidechains

321

adjacent to a pre-existing internal cavity were examined for potential substitutions to bulkier

322

hydrophobic residues. Proline substitutions were designed in the FP, connector region, or HR1

323

and placed either in a flexible loop or at the N-terminus of a helix. Combinations were chosen to

324

test whether pairs of the same type of design (e.g. disulfide/disulfide) or different types of

325

designs (e.g. disulfide/proline) could result in additive effects on spike expression and stability.

326

Protein expression and purification

327

Plasmids encoding S variants were transiently transfected into FreeStyle 293-F cells (Thermo

328

Fisher) using polyethyleneimine, with 5 μM kifunensine being added 3h post-transfection.

329

Cultures were harvested four days after transfection and the medium was separated from the cells

330

by centrifugation. Supernatants were passed through a 0.22 µm filter and then over StrepTactin

resin (IBA). Spike variants were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a

332

Superose 6 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) in a buffer composed of 2 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM

333

NaCl and 0.02% NaN3. For initial purification and characterization, single-substitution and

334

combination spike variants were purified from 40 mL cultures. For the 2L HexaPro purification,

335

the size-exclusion column used was a Superose 6 16/600 column (GE Healthcare).

336

ExpiCHO cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding HexaPro using

337

Expifectamine, and cells were grown for six days at 32 °C according to the manufacturer’s High

338

Titer protocol (Thermo Fisher). Supernatants were then passed through a 0.22 µm filter and

339

batch-purified using IMAC resin (Sigma-Aldrich). The IMAC elution was then purified by size-

340

exclusion chromatography using a Superose 6 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) in a buffer

341

composed of 2 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN3.

342

Differential scanning fluorimetry

343

In a 96-well qPCR plate, solutions were prepared with a final concentration of 5X SYPRO

344

Orange Protein Gel Stain (Thermo Fisher) and 0.25 mg/ml spike. Continuous fluorescence

345

measurements (λex=465 nm, λem=580 nm) were performed using a Roche LightCycler 480 II,

346

using a temperature ramp rate of 4.4 °C/minute increasing from 22 °C to 95 °C. Data were

347

plotted as the derivative of the melting curve as a function of temperature.

349

Purified SARS-CoV-2 S variants were diluted to a concentration of 0.04 mg/mL in 2 mM Tris

(Nanoprobes). Grids were imaged at a magnification of 92,000X (corresponding to a calibrated

354

pixel size of 1.63 Å/pix) in a Talos F200C TEM microscope equipped with a Ceta 16M detector

355

(Thermo Fisher). Stability experiments with S-2P and HexaPro were performed by imaging

356

samples as described above after 3 rounds of snap freezing with liquid nitrogen and thawing,

357

after storing samples at room temperature for 1-2 days, or after incubating at 50 °C, 55 °C, or 60

358

°C for 30 minutes in a thermal cycler.

359

Biolayer interferometry for quantification of protein expression

360

Plasmids encoding spike variants were transfected into FreeStyle 293-F cells (Thermo Fisher) in

361

3 mL of medium and harvested four days after transfection. After centrifugation, supernatant was

362

diluted 5-fold with buffer composed of 10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA,

363

0.05% Tween 20 and 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin. Anti-foldon IgG was immobilized to an

364

anti-human Fc (AHC) biosensor (FortéBio) using an Octet RED96e (FortéBio). The IgG loaded

365

biosensor was then dipped into wells containing individual spike variants. A standard curve was

366

determined by measuring 2-fold serial dilutions of purified S-2P at concentrations ranging from

367

10 μg/mL to 0.16 μg/mL. The data were reference-subtracted, aligned to a baseline after IgG

368

capture and quantified based on a linear fit of the initial slope for each association curve using

369

Octet Data Analysis software v11.1.

370

Surface plasmon resonance

371

His-tagged HexaPro was immobilized to a NiNTA sensorchip (GE Healthcare) to a level of ~500

372

response units (RUs) using a Biacore X100 (GE Healthcare) and running buffer composed of 10

373

mM HEPES pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20. Serial dilutions of purified hACE2

374

were injected at concentrations ranging from 250 to 15.6 nM. Response curves were fit to a 1:1

375

binding model using Biacore X100 Evaluation Software (GE Healthcare).

376

Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection

377

Purified HexaPro was diluted to a concentration of 0.35 mg/mL in 2 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM

378

NaCl, 0.02% NaN3 and applied to plasma-cleaned CF-400 1.2/1.3 grids before being blotted for

379

6 seconds in a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher) and plunge frozen into liquid ethane. 3,511

380

micrographs were collected from a single grid using a FEI Titan Krios (Thermo Fisher) equipped

381

with a K3 detector (Gatan). Data were collected at a magnification of 81,000x, corresponding to

382

a calibrated pixel size of 1.08 Å/pix. A full description of the data collection parameters can be

383

found in Table S3.

384

Cryo-EM data processing

385

Motion correction, CTF-estimation and particle picking were performed in Warp34. Particles

386

were then imported into cryoSPARC v2.15.0 for 2D classification, ab initio 3D reconstruction,

387

heterogeneous 3D refinement and non-uniform homogeneous refinement35. The one-RBD-up

388

reconstruction was subjected to local B-factor sharpening using LocalDeBlur36 and the two-

389

RBD-up reconstruction was sharpened in cryoSPARC. Iterative model building and refinement

390

were performed with Coot, Phenix and ISOLDE37–39.

Figure 1. Exemplary substitutions for SARS-CoV-2 spike stabilization. Side view of the trimeric
SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain in a prefusion conformation (PDB ID: 6VSB). The S1 domains are shown
as a transparent molecular surface. The S2 domain for each protomer is shown as a ribbon diagram. Each
inset corresponds to one of four types of spike modifications (proline, salt bridge, disulfide, cavity filling).
Side chains in each inset are shown as red spheres (proline), yellow sticks (disulfide), red and blue sticks
(salt bridge) and orange spheres (cavity filling).
