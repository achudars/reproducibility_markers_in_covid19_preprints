Running Title: Remdesivir inhibits SARS-CoV-2

Abstract
The global pandemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or 2019nCoV) has prompted multiple clinical trials to jumpstart search for anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies from
existing drugs, including those with reported in vitro efficacies as well as those ones that are not known
to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, such as ritonavir/lopinavir and favilavir. Here we report that after screening 19
antiviral drugs that are either in clinical trials or with proposed activity against SARS-CoV-2, remdesivir
was the most effective. Chloroquine only effectively protected virus-induced cytopathic effect at around
30 µM with a therapeutic index of 1.5. Our findings also suggest that velpatasvir, ledipasvir, ritonavir,
litonavir, lopinavir, favilavir, sofosbuvir, danoprevir, and pocapavir do not have direct antiviral effect.

Main Text
The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China (Zhou et al., 2020)
and causes coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), a new disease marked by fevers and
pneumonia-like symptoms. As of date, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to essentially all continents and killed
over 165,000 worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak
a global pandemic. Unprecedented public-health measures including lockdown of major cities appear to
have contained the spread of the virus within China, but the effectiveness of such measures at a global
scale remains a contentious topic. Given a prophylactic vaccine will not likely be available in the
immediate future, an effective therapeutic intervention could potentially be a game-changer in
combating COVID-19. For this reason, multiple countries have unleashed a frenzy of clinical trials hoping
to find a drug that can be repurposed to treat COVID-19. Nonetheless, there has been a paucity of
information as to the direct antiviral effect of some drugs in trials. Here, we set out an in vitro study to
evaluate 19 investigational antiviral drugs, including some approved by the FDA for other indications, for
their efficacies against SARS-CoV-2. The list includes several viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRP) inhibitors, viral protease inhibitors, chloroquine, a furin inhibitor, and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
The rationale of choosing these drugs was based on in silico prediction(Elfiky, 2020), reported possible
effect(Liu et al., 2020), and publicly reported trials(Cao et al., 2020). For example, Sofosbuvir, sold under
the brand name Sovaldi among others, attracted our attention as a potent, once-daily, orally
administered nucleotide analog prodrug inhibitor of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B polymerase.
Sofosbuvir is metabolized in vivo to the active antiviral agent GS-461203 (2'-deoxy-2'-α-fluoro-β-Cmethyluridine-5'-triphosphate). GS-461203 serves as a defective substrate for the NS5B protein, thus
blocks viral RNA synthesis. Sofosbuvir has been identified in molecular docking as a potential SARS-CoV2 inhibitor(Elfiky, 2020). Favilavir, an approved influenza RdRP inhibitor in China and Japan, is being used
in a clinical trial in China to treat COVID-19(Liu et al., 2020). Several HCV or HIV inhibitors, such as
Velpatasvir(Chen et al., 2020), Ledipasvir(Chen et al., 2020), Ritonavir(Shah et al., 2020), Lopinavir(Shah
et al., 2020) are predicted to be possible anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs as well.
Our screen assay is based on the protection of SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathic effect (CPE), which is
particularly pronounced in Vero cells. We hypothesized that inhibitors of virus infection would prevent
cell death. One major advantage of the CPE-based screen is that compounds that are toxic to cells at the
tested doses are simultaneously excluded for future consideration as a drug. To ensure our assay is
robust, we carried out the screen under two different infectious doses (multiplicity of infection of 0.01
and 0.001, respectively). For most drugs, we tested three concentrations: 1, 10, 50 µM. When a drug
displayed protective effect, we further expanded the range of concentrations to locate the half maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50). The results are summarized in Table 1. Briefly, most drugs that we tested
failed to prevent SARS-CoV-2-induced cell death, including Sofosbuvir and Favilavir. Additionally,
combination of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir or ledipasvir failed to protect infected cells either.
Chloroquine, as well as its hydroxyl form, had been allowed by the U.S. FDA to be provided to certain
hospitalized patients under an emergency use authorization. In our study, however, chloroquine only
showed minimal activity with an IC50 close to 30 µM when being added one hour prior to infection with
a therapeutic index of 1.5. This finding contrasts with a reported IC50 of 6.9 µM in another study(Wang
et al., 2020). Given that it normally takes more drug to achieve a full protection in a CPE-based assay,
the IC50 measured by our assay is expected to be higher than that measured by assays measuring viral
RNA(Wang et al., 2020). Nonetheless, when being added post-infection, chloroquine displayed negligible

protective effect against virus-induced cell death. Altogether, our finding cautions conducting clinical
trials with existing drugs in treating COVID-19. Without even in vitro efficacy support, using these drugs
in patients is risky because potential side effects. Indeed, ritonavir and lopinavir were declared
ineffective after a failed clinical trial(Cao et al., 2020); Brazilian government recently halted a small trial
involving chloroquine after patients developed irregular heart rates. Our results did support the
potential of Remdesivir as a drug to treat COVID-19. Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a nucleotide prodrug that
has broad antiviral activity against viruses from different families in vitro(Lo et al., 2017), and
therapeutic efficacy in nonhuman primate models of lethal Ebola virus and Nipah virus infection(Lo et
al., 2019; Warren et al., 2016). Remdesivir (GS-5734) effectively inhibited MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV)
replication in vitro and showed efficacy against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV in a
mouse model(Sheahan et al., 2017). In consistent, compassionate use of remdesivir in patients
hospitalized for severe COVID-19 displayed clinical improvement in 68% of the patients (68%)(J. Grein,
2020). Overall, our study reinforces the notion that clinical trials must be supported by rigorous preclinical studies as we take an accelerated pace of developing new drugs to combat SARS-CoV-2.

Methods
Drugs, Cells and Virus
Remdesivir, sofosbuvir, danoprevir, pocapavir, bemcentinib (R428) were purchased from
Medchemexpress LLC. Chloroquine, velpatasvir, ledipasvir were bought from Fisher. Nelfinavir, ritonavir,
saquinavir, indinavir, amprenavir, lopinavir, raltegravir, tenofovir, AZT were from NIH AIDS Reagent
Program. Favilavir was obtained from Cayman Chemical and chloromethylketone was from Enzo Life
Sciences.
Vero E6 cell line was purchased from American Type and Cell Collection (ATCC) and cultured in eagle’s
minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin and L-glutamine.
The SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1-2020 was obtained from BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH, and had been passed
three times on Vero cells and 1 time on Vero E6 cells prior to acquisition. It was further passed once on
Vero E6 cells in our lab.

Virus titration
SARS-CoV-2 strain WA1-2020 was titered using the Reed & Muench Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50
Assay (TCID50/ml) system (Reed, 1938). Vero cells were plated the day before infection into 96 well
plates at 1.5 x 104 cells/well. On the day of the experiment, serial dilutions of virus were made in media
and a total of 6-8 wells were infected with each serial dilution of the virus. After 48 hours incubation,
cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by staining with 0.1% crystal violet. The TCID50 was
then calculated using the formula: log (TCID50)=log(do)+ log (R)(f+1). Where do represents the dilution
giving a positive well, f is a number derived from the number of positive wells calculated by a moving
average, and R is the dilution factor.

CPE-based drug screening assay.
VeroE6 cells were seeded at 1.8 x104cells/well in a 96 well plate 24 hours before the experiment. After
cells had reached 80% confluency, they were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the presence or absence of a
compound for two hours. One hour (or whatever time it is) after the infection the virus was removed,
and fresh compound was added back to each well. Two Days after infection media was removed from
the cells and at least 50μl of the CellTiter-Glo® Reagent was then quickly added to all wells in the
luminometer plate and the luciferase reading was quantified with a Veritas luminometer (Promega). The
cytopathic effect was quantified by the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay system (Promega,
WI). Both IC50 and CC50 were calculated using Prism 7.0 (Graphpad).
