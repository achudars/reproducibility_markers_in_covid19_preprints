Abstract

27

CoV-2 infection. Critically lacking however is a reusable datamine to allow users to compare and

28

explore these data for insight, inference, and hypothesis generation. To accomplish this, we

29

harmonized datasets from blood, bronchoalveolar lavage and tissue samples from COVID-19 and

30

other control conditions and derived a compendium of gene signature modules per cell type,

31

subtype, clinical condition and compartment. We demonstrate approaches for exploring and

32

evaluating their significance via a new interactive web portal (ToppCell). As examples, we

33

develop three hypotheses: (1) a multicellular signaling cascade among alternatively differentiated

34

monocyte-derived macrophages whose tasks include T cell recruitment and activation; (2) novel

35

platelet subtypes with drastically modulated expression of genes responsible for adhesion,

36

coagulation and thrombosis; (3) a multilineage cell activator network able to drive extrafollicular

37

B maturation via an ensemble of genes extensively associated with risk for developing

Introduction

52

associated with immunological and inflammatory responses to SARS-Cov-2 infection (1, 2) and

53

many recent single cell expression profiling studies have characterized patterns of

54

immunoinflammatory responses among individuals, mostly during acute infection phases.

55

Different studies have revealed a spectrum of responses that range from lymphopenia (3, 4),

56

cytokine storms (5, 6), differential interferon responses (7, 8) and emergency myelopoiesis (9,

57

10). However, a variety of obstacles limit the ability of the research and medical communities to

58

explore and compare these studies to pursue additional questions and gain additional insights that

59

could improve our understanding of cell type specific responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and

60

their impact on clinical outcome.

61

Whereas many studies have focused on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) (9, 11–

62

14) due to ease of procurement, other studies have profiled airway locations via bronchoalveolar

63

lavage (BAL) (15, 16), nasopharyngeal swabs, and bronchial brushes (17). Additional sampling

64

sites that could also be infected or affected have also been approached in autopsy-derived

65

materials from the central nervous system (18, 19), and other sites (20). Moreover, as major

66

COVID-19 consortiums working on the collection and integration of each of their individual

67

studies and interpreting important features of these individual datasets as downloadable datasets

68

or browsable versions, such as single cell portal

69

(https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/covid19) and COVID-19 Cell Atlas

70

(https://www.covid19cellatlas.org/), using these data beyond markers, cell types, and individual

71

signatures is either not possible or not accomplishable across-datasets. Thus, a well-organized and

72

systematic study of immune cells across tissues for in-depth biological explorations is an unmet

73

need for a deeper understanding of the underlying basis of the breadth of COVID-19 host defense

74

and pathobiology.

COVID-19 clinical outcomes are variable. The poorer outcomes due to this infection are highly

75
76

Here we harmonized and analyzed eight high quality publicly available single-cell RNA-seq

77

datasets from COVID-19 and immunologically-related studies that in total covered more than

78

480,000 cells isolated from peripheral blood, bronchial alveolar lavage and lung parenchyma

79

samples, and assembled an integrated COVID-19 atlas (https://toppcell.cchmc.org/). We

80

established a framework for deriving, characterizing, and establishing reference gene expression

81

signatures from these harmonized datasets using modular and hierarchical approaches based on

82

signatures per class, subclass, and signaling/activation and clinical status per each sample group.

83

Leveraging these gene expression signature modules, we demonstrate datamining approaches that

84

allow for the identification of a series of fundamental disease processes: (1) an intercellular

85

monocytic activation cascade capable of mediating the emergence of hyperinflammatory

86

monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages in severe COVID-19 patients; (2) the generation of

87

several alternatively differentiated platelet subtypes with dramatically different expression of sets

88

of genes associated with critical platelet tasks capable of altering vascular and tissue responses to

89

infectious agents; and (3) a multilineage and multi cell type cooperative signaling network with

90

the potential to drive extrafollicular B maturation at a lesion site, but do so with high risk for the

91

development of B cell-associated immunity. Additionally, immune hallmarks of COVID-19

92

patients were compared with other immune-mediated diseases using single-cell data from patients

93

with influenza, sepsis, or multiple sclerosis. Consistent and varied compositional and gene

94

patterns were identified across these implicating striking COVID-19 effects in some individuals.

Results
Creating the First COVID-19 Signature Atlas Using ToppCell Portal
To have a comprehensive coverage of cells, we collated single-cell data of COVID-19 patients

100

from eight public datasets, which in total contains 231,800 PBMCs, 101,800 BAL cells and

101

146,361 lung parenchyma cells from donors: 43 healthy; 22 mild; 42 severe; and 2 convalescent

102

patients (Fig. 1A, table S1).

103
104

To assemble an integrated atlas of human cell responses to COVID-19, we sought to harmonize

105

metadata encompassing clinical information, sampling compartments, and cell and gene

106

expression module designations. Doing so provides a rich framework for detecting perturbations

107

of cell repertoire and differentiative state adaptations. We first integrated single cell RNA-seq

108

data in Seurat (21) and annotated cell types using canonical markers (table S2). Further

109

annotations of B cell and T cell subtypes were completed using the reference-based labeling tool

110

Azimuth (22). Sub-clustering was applied for some cell types, such as neutrophils and platelets, to

111

interrogate finer resolutions of disease-specific sub-populations (Fig. 1B). Using the ToppCell

112

toolkit (https://toppcell.cchmc.org/), we created over 3,000 hierarchical gene modules of the most

113

significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for all cell classes and sub-clusters across

114

compartments and disease severity (table S1). These modules were then used to infer cell-cell

115

interactions as well as upregulated pathways, which were further combined for functional

116

comparative analysis in a specific cell manner in ToppCluster (23) (Fig. 1B), such as sub-clusters

117

of platelets. Integration of ToppCluster output of cells from multiple compartments and disease

118

conditions built pathogenic maps, highlighted by the coagulation map of COVID-19 (fig. S12). In

119

addition, perturbation of cell abundance was evaluated either in one cell population, or in multiple

120

populations across diseases. Taken together, we investigated cell abundance changes, severity-

121

associated signatures, mechanisms of COVID-19 specific symptoms and unique features of

122

COVID-19 as an immune-mediated disease (Fig. 1B).

123
124

Dynamic Changes and Balance of COVID-19 Immune Repository in Blood and Lung

125

After the aforementioned cell annotation procedure, we identified 28 and 24 distinct cell types in

126

PBMC and BAL respectively (Fig. 2, A and C, table S2). Shifts of Uniform Manifold

127

Approximation and Projection (UMAP) of cell type distributions were observed in both

128

compartments of mild and severe patients (Fig. 2, A and C, fig. S1A and fig. S3A). In PBMC,

129

conventional dendritic cells (cDC), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and non-classical

130

monocytes displayed a prominent reduction in severe patients (Fig. 2B and fig. S1C), consistent

131

with prior reports (11, 24, 25). In contrast, severe patients demonstrated dramatic expansion of

132

neutrophils, especially immature stages (fig. S1C and fig. S2). Integration with evoked pathways

133

in the following analysis implicated that neutrophil expansion was likely the consequence of

134

emergency myelopoiesis (26). Additionally, a general down-regulation of T cell and NK cell was

135

observed, consistent with lymphopenia reported in clinical practices (5, 27) (fig. S1C and fig. S2).

136

However, the trend of T cell subtypes varies across studies and individuals, apart from

137

proliferative T cells which have a dramatic increase in mild and severe patients (fig. S2). Notably,

138

plasmablasts substantially increased in COVID-19 patients, and especially so in severe patients,

139

suggesting upregulated antibody production (28) (Fig. 2B and fig. S1C). Expansion of platelets is

140

another significant change observed in severe patients, possibly leading to immunothrombosis in

141

the lung, which could be closely associated with the severity of the disease (29, 30) (Fig. 2B and

142

fig. S1C).

143
144

In samples obtained from patients’ lungs, we observed the depletion of FABP4high tissue-resident

145

alveolar macrophages (TRAM) and dramatic expansion of FCN1high monocyte-derived alveolar

146

macrophages (MoAM) in severe patients (Fig. 2, C and D and fig. S3D). Mild patients exhibited a

147

moderate reduction of tissue-resident macrophages, but no evidence of aggregation of monocyte-

148

derived macrophages (Fig. 2, C and D, fig. S3, A and D). Dynamic changes of these two subtypes

149

suggest increased tissue chemoattraction (31) and potential damage of patients' lungs (32). In

150

addition, neutrophils were only identified in severe patients in the integrated BAL data (Fig. 2C

151

and fig. S3A), which might be related with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in the lung (33).

152

However, more samples are required to draw a solid conclusion. We also noted conventional

153

dendritic cells decreased in the severe patients, which is consistent with the trend of the

154

counterpart in PBMC data. Opposite to the change in PBMC, an expansion of plasmacytoid

155

dendritic cells is observed in both mild and severe patients (Fig. 2D). Other cell types, including T

156

cell and NK cell in the BAL, also have converse changes of their counterparts in PBMC, which

157

could be attracted by lung macrophages or epithelial cells after infection or damages (17) (Fig. 2D

158

and fig. S3D). These changes were consistently observed in lung parenchyma samples from

159

severe COVID-19 patients (fig. S4). With cells well-annotated in the integrated COVID-19 atlas,

160

we drew a global heatmap for cells in both blood and lung using ToppCell gene modules (top 50

161

DEG in each module) of all identified cell classes. While there was conservation of gene patterns

162

involved in healthy donors and severe COVID-19 patients, there were substantial differences

163

most notably in myeloid cells (Fig. 2E). Such hierarchically ordered ToppCell gene modules were

164

broadly used in visualization, large-scale comparisons and fine-resolution investigations in the

165

following analyses.

Myeloid Cell Atlas: Functionally Distinct Neutrophils at Different Levels of Maturation and

168

Derailed Macrophages in the Lung

169

Dysregulated myeloid cells have been reported as an important marker of severe COVID-19

170

patients (9, 10). In order to gain a deeper and comprehensive understanding of these cells, we

171

applied the sub-clustering strategy on the integrated data of key cell types, such as neutrophils and

172

macrophages, and then generated gene modules for comparative functional analysis and

173

interactome inference. We successfully identified 5 neutrophil sub-clusters after the integration of

174

PBMC and BAL data, including 3 FCGR3B+ mature sub-clusters and 2 FCGR3B- immature sub-

175

clusters (Fig. 3A and fig. S5B, table S3). They’re mainly from severe patients and their gene

176

modules were generated and subjected to comparative functional enrichment using ToppCell and

177

ToppCluster (Fig. 3, C and D, fig. S5A). We identified proliferative neutrophils (referred to as

178

pro-neutrophils and Neu4) and MMP8high precursor immature neutrophils (referred to as pre-

179

neutrophils and Neu2) (Fig. 3A and fig. S5B) consistent with prior studies (9). While immune

180

response genes and pathways were barely activated in the immature neutrophils, they displayed

181

upregulation of granule formation pathways and NETosis-associated proteins, including ELANE,

182

DEFA4 and MPO, especially in Neu4 (9, 26) (Fig. 3C, fig. S5, B and C). Upregulated myeloid

183

leukocyte mediated immunity in Neu2 suggests involvement of this cell type in anti-viral function

184

(Fig. S5D). Yet, the absence of cytokine and interferon response pathways suggests the lack of

185

mature immune responses (Fig. 3D). Notably, compared to mature neutrophils (Neu0 and Neu1)

186

in the blood, the extravasated hyperinflammatory sub-cluster (Neu3) from BAL of severe patients

187

shows extraordinarily high expression of interferon-stimulated genes, as well as prominent

188

upregulation of productions and responses to cytokines and interferons (Fig. 3, C and D, fig S5, B

189

and D).

190
191

MoAM and TRAM were two main macrophage types in the BAL (Fig. 2C); both are known to

192

have distinct roles in immune responses in the lung (15). As described above, five sub-clusters

193

among the expanded COVID-19 patient-specific MoAM (Fig. 3B, table S3) were found, where

194

the loss of HLA class II genes and elevation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were

195

consistently observed (Fig. 3F and fig. S6A). Relative to MoAM3,4, MoAM1,2,5 displayed an

196

upregulation of interferon responses and cytokine production (Fig. 3D, fig. S6B and table S3),

197

indicating their pro-inflammatory characteristics. Notably, MoAM5 shows dramatic upregulation

198

of IL-6 secretion and cytokine receptor binding activities (Fig. S7, A to D). However, cells in this

199

sub-cluster were mainly from one severe patient (fig. S3C). We still need more data to fully

200

understand such dramatic upregulation of IL-6 secretion in some severe patients. Similar to

201

MoAM, we also identified two distinct groups of TRAM in BAL (Fig. 3B and fig. S6B),

202

including quiescent TRAM (TRAM1 and TRAM2) and activated TRAM (TRAM3). The

203

quiescent group was mainly from healthy donors with enriched pathways of ATP metabolism

204

(Fig. 3D), while the activated group from mild and severe patients displays upregulation of ISGs

205

and cytokine signaling pathways (fig. S6B and table S3). However, the magnitude of activation

206

and inflammatory responses in TRAM3 is smaller than MoAM1,2,5. Not surprisingly, stronger

207

antigen processing and presentation activities were observed in TRAM3 relative to MoAM1,2,5

208

(Fig. 3D, fig. S6B and table S3). Collectively, we concluded that tissue-resident macrophages

209

were greatly depleted in severe patients as the front-line innate immune responders in the lung.

210

Pro-inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages infiltrate into the lung, leading to the cytokine

211

storm and damage of the lung. Large amounts of infiltration of MoAM were not observed in mild

212

COVID-19 patients, probably due to the controlled infection, which could explain milder lung

213

damages in those patients.

215

To develop an understanding of the interaction network in the lung microenvironment of severe

216

COVID-19 patients, we focused on signaling ligands, receptors and pathways using ToppCell and

217

CellChat (Fig. 3E and fig. S8, A and B). Notably, basal cells, MoAMs, neutrophils and T cells all

218

contributed to the cytokine, chemokine and interleukin signaling networks. Strikingly, severe

219

patient specific MoAM2 shows the broadest upregulation of signaling ligands, including CCL2,

220

CCL3, CCL7, CCL8, CXCL9, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, IL6, IL15 and IL27, suggesting its

221

role as a signaling network hub that is distinct from the other major signaling ligand-expressing

222

cells of BAL such as epithelial and other myeloid cell types such as TRAM3 and proliferating

223

myeloid cells (fig. S8A). Among the MoAM2 top signaling molecules, attractants CXCL8,

224

CXCL9 and CXCL10 are known to target CXCR3 on T cells, suggesting their role is to stimulate

225

migration of T cells to the epithelial interface and into BAL fluid (Fig. 3E) (15). In addition,

226

many of MoAM2’s ligands have the potential to cause autocrine signaling activation via IL6-

227

IL6R, IL1RN-ILR2, CCL7-CCR1, CCL2-CCR1 and CCL4-CCR1, indicating its active roles in

228

self-stimulation and development, which further amplify the attraction and migration of T cells

229

and other immune cells. Notably, CCR1 was also expressed in activated TRAM3, but with a

230

lower level. Although IL6 expression level is relatively low compared to other ligands in BAL

231

data, substantial expression of IL6R was observed in MoAMs. The CCL and CXCL signaling

232

pathways of neutrophils are less strong than MoAMs (fig. S8B), but they displayed high

233

expression levels of CXCR1 and CXCR2, which binds with a large number of the chemokines

234

from MoAM and epithelial cells (Fig. 3E). In addition, neutrophils exhibit an extraordinarily high

235

level of IL1B, which could potentially in turn activate macrophages (fig. S8, A and B). TRAM3

236

also displayed a unique pattern of signaling molecules, with a substantial level of CCL23 which

237

could potentially attract MoAM by the interaction with CCR1. Secretion of CXCL3 and CXCL5

238

in TRAM3 towards CXCR2 could be a potential chemoattraction pathway for neutrophils. In turn,

239

neutrophils could activate TRAM3 by secreting IL1B, which binds with IL1RAP. Additionally,

240

CD4+ T cells could also activate TRAM3 by IL10-IL10RB interaction (Fig. 3E and fig. S8, A and

241

B).

242
243

In addition to neutrophils and macrophages, the upregulation of ISGs was observed in classical

244

monocytes of both mild and severe patients (cMono3, cMono4), while the reduction of the MHC

245

class II cell surface receptor HLA-DR genes was only observed in severe patients (cMono4) (fig.

246

S9). In cDCs, polarization of interleukin secretion was observed in mild-patient and severe-

247

patient specific clusters (fig. S10F). Collectively, dynamic changes of marker genes,

248

transcriptional profiles, signaling molecules and biological activities reveal the heterogeneity of

249

myeloid cell sub-clusters across disease severity (fig. S11C). Pro-inflammatory gene expression

250

was found in all major myeloid cell types, including cMono4, DC1, DC9 in PBMC and Neu3,

251

DC10, MoAM1, MoAM2, MoAM5 in BAL of COVID-19 patients. The reduction of MHC class

252

II (HLA-II) genes is a common feature of classical monocytes and macrophages in COVID-19

253

patients and implies impaired capacity to activate T cell adaptive immunity.

254
255

COVID-19 Coagulation and Immunothrombosis Map

256

Individuals severely affected during acute phase COVID-19 infection, and in particular those with

257

significantly elevated risk of death, frequently demonstrate striking dysregulation of coagulation

258

and thrombosis characterized by hypercoagulability and microvascular thromboses (endothelial

259

aggregations of platelets and fibrin) and highly elevated D-dimer levels. Yet, COVID-19 does not

260

lead to wide scale consumption of fibrinogen and clotting factors (29, 30, 34–36). At present, we

261

lack a molecular or cellular explanation of the underlying basis of this pathobiology (29, 37). To

262

evaluate candidate effectors of this pathobiology, we used a list of genes associated with

263

abnormal thrombosis from mouse and human gene mutation phenotypes and identified

264

parenchymal lung sample endothelial cells and platelets in PBMC as cell types highly enriched

265

with respect to genes responsible for the regulation of hemostasis (fig. S12). Because platelet

266

counts were greatly elevated in severe versus mild individuals, we further examined platelet gene

267

expression signatures and cell type differentiation and identified six distinct platelet sub-clusters

268

shared across all datasets after data integration (Fig. 4, A and B). Severe-patient-specific PLT0 is

269

an interesting sub-cluster with elevated integrin genes, including ITGA2B, ITGB1, ITGB3,

270

ITGB5, as well as thrombosis-related genes, such as SELP, HPSE, ANO6 and PF4V1. Antibodies

271

against the latter are associated with thrombosis including adverse reactions to recent COVID-19

272

vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (38). In addition, upregulated pathways of hemostasis, wound

273

healing and blood coagulation were also observed in PLT0 (Fig. S13A and table S4). Importantly,

274

PLT2 is an inflammatory sub-cluster with an upregulation of ISGs and interferon signaling

275

pathways, while PLT4 is highlighted by upregulated post-transcriptional RNA splicing activities

276

(Fig. S13, A and C).

277
278

Severity-associated gene patterns were also identified by selecting coagulation-associated genes

279

modules (Fig. 4C and table S4), indicating distinct coagulation activities across platelets. Apart

280

from pan-platelet genes, we found dramatic upregulation of genes involved in platelet activation,

procoagulant heparanase (HPSE) (39), Anoctamin-6 (ANO6) (40), and selectin P (SELP) (41)

283

(Fig. 4, C and D). Heparanase is an endoglycosidase that cleaves heparan sulfate constituents, a

284

major component of anti-coagulation glycocalyx on the surface of vascular endothelium (42, 43).

285

Upregulated heparanase was related to upregulation of cell-matrix adhesion and coagulation (Fig.

286

4D). Thrombotic vascular damages could be caused by the degradation function of heparinase

287

enriched in platelets of severe patients. Elevation of ANO6 is known to trigger phospholipid

288

scrambling in platelets, resulting in phosphatidylserine exposure which is essential for activation

289

of the clotting system (44). In addition, other upregulated genes involved in coagulation-

290

associated activities were also observed, including wound healing, fibrinolysis, platelet

291

aggregation and activation (Fig. 4D), which likely collectively contribute to the clotting issue of

292

severe COVID-19 patients.

Emergence of Developing Plasmablasts and B Cell Association with Autoimmunity

295

Autoimmune disorders in COVID-19 patients such as immune thrombocytopaenic purpura (ITP)

296

is now recognized as a known disease complication (45–49). However, little is known about the

297

molecular and cellular mechanism behind it. To examine this further, we integrated B cells and

298

plasmablasts from both PBMC and BAL and conducted systematic analysis (Fig. 5, A and B and

299

fig. S14, A and B). Several COVID-19 specific sub-clusters were identified in B cells, such as

300

ISGhigh activated B cells (cluster 7) (Fig. 5A). Importantly, activated B cells showed dramatic

301

upregulation of interferon signaling pathways and cytokine productions (fig. S15A), indicating its

302

anti-virus characteristics. Notably, plasmablasts were mainly observed in severe COVID-19

303

patients, where a group of proliferative cells was identified and labeled as developing

304

plasmablasts (Fig. 5B). In contrast, non-dividing plasmablasts displayed upregulation of

305

immunoglobulin genes (IGHA1, IGHA2, IGKC), B cell markers (CD79A) (50), interleukin

306

receptors (IL2RG) and type II HLA complex (HLA-DOB) (Fig. 5C and table S5). In addition,

307

non-dividing plasmablasts showed unique isotypes of immunoglobulin (Ig) in sub-regions of

308

UMAP, whereas developing plasmablasts displayed obscure Ig types (fig. S14, E and F).

309

Antibody production activities were upregulated in non-dividing plasmablasts based on gene

310

enrichment analysis (Fig. S15A and table S5). Collectively, we inferred that non-dividing

311

plasmablasts had definite immunoglobulin isotypes and were actively involved in immune

312

responses towards COVID infection, while developing plasmablasts were less mature but highly

313

proliferative to replenish the repertoire of plasma cells.

314
315

Since there are few clues of gene associations of autoimmunity in COVID-19, we brought up a

316

hypothesis-driven, prior knowledge-based approach to discover and prioritize genes for the

317

specific phenotype (Fig. 5D). First, gene modules of B cells and other cells in severe patients

318

were collected and subjected to ToppGene for enrichment analysis. Then we queried

319

autoimmunity-associated terms in the enriched output and identified associated genes. After that,

320

we retrieved interaction pairs using ToppCluster and CellChat database (51). In the end, we

321

identified genes that are not only involved in autoimmunity, but have a mediator role in the

322

immune signaling network. Using this approach, we observed several candidate pairs of genes,

323

including TNFSF13B-TNSRSF13, IL10-IL10RA, IL21-IL21RA, IL6-IL6R, CXCL13-CXCR5,

324

CXCL12-CXCR4, CCL21-CCR7, CCL19-CCR7 and CCL20-CCR6 in severe patients, which

325

were enriched for autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune thyroid diseases, lupus nephritis,

326

autoimmune encephalomyelitis (52–56). Candidate cytokine and chemokine ligand genes were

327

expressed in various cell types in PBMC and BAL, including IL21 and CXCL13 from exhausted

328

T cells of BAL, CXCL12 from mesenchymal cells, IL6 and CCL21 from endothelial cells,

329

CCL19 from cDC and CCL20, TNFSF13B, and TNFSF13 from lung macrophages (Fig. 5E and

330

table S5). These interaction pairs have been linked with auto-immunity (57, 58). In addition, we

331

analyzed single-cell studies (59, 60) of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus nephritis patients and found

332

that high expression levels of the candidate receptors in B cells and ligands in other cells were

333

also observed, such as CXCL13 in helper T cells and CXCR5 in B cells in both studies (fig. S15,

334

C and D). However, more evidence is still required to infer the association between these

335

interactions and autoimmunity in COVID-19 patients. Supported by the evidence above, we drew

336

a network for potential mediator interactions of B cells and their associations with autoimmune

337

disorders, where linkages with diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus

338

erythematosus, were highlighted, as well as linkages with mouse phenotypes, such as abnormal

339

immune tolerance and increased susceptibility to autoimmune disorder (Fig. 5F). As a caveat,

340

although using prior knowledge to prioritize gene and cell-associated functions and interactions

341

may introduce biases, such approaches also have the potential to highlight key similarities and

342

differences between different disease causes and clinical responses and improve our

343

understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms at work.

Functional Map and Immune Cell Interplay Landscape in COVID-19

346

As above, where highly significant enrichments of unique functions and pathways could be

347

identified in the subtypes of multiple cell classes, such as neutrophils, platelets and B cells, we

348

sought to get a more holistic understanding of COVID-19 specific cell class and subclass-level

349

signatures, including T cell subtypes (fig. S16 and fig. S17), we built an integrative functional

350

map of all cell types in three compartments across multiple disease conditions using a highly

351

integrated gene module set (Fig. 6A and table S6). All enriched functional associations in

352

ToppCluster for gene modules of cell types and sub-clusters were depicted. They were grouped

353

by disease conditions and compartments to show heterogeneity of cellular functions in different

354

circumstances.

355
356

In the heatmap (Fig. 6A), most enrichments were consistently observed across cells of healthy

357

donors and COVID-19 patients. However, some unique patterns were also identified. For

358

example, T cells and NK cells in healthy donors show enrichments of mitochondrial transport and

359

ATP metabolic process, while activated T cells in mild patients show upregulation of type I

360

interferon production and cytokine signaling. Enrichments of macrophage differentiation and

361

neutrophil migration regulation were uniquely found in MoAM1 in severe patients (Fig. 6A). The

362

function map provides a high-level approach to investigate functional variations of cells across

363

disease conditions and compartments. The predicted interplay of immune cells across multiple

364

compartments and disease conditions is displayed in Fig. 6B. Cell proportion changes, sub-cluster

365

specific signatures and cell-cell interaction are also depicted.

366
367

Similarity and Heterogeneity Between COVID-19 and Other Immune-mediated Diseases

368

To further analyze COVID-19 specific immune signatures, we compared immune cells from

369

COVID-19 patients with cells in other immune-mediated diseases, including severe influenza

370

(12), sepsis (61) and multiple sclerosis (62). 404,125 cells were included after the integration of

371

PBMC single-cell datasets (Fig. 7A and fig. S18, table S7). Dynamic changes of cell abundance

372

were compared in diseases versus healthy donors. Similar to COVID-19 patients, severe influenza

373

patients also exhibited the reduction of non-classical monocytes, pDC, cDC and CD4+ TCM, but

374

the effect of the former two types was smaller in magnitude (Fig. 7B). However, the reduction of

375

non-classical monocytes is more significant in severe COVID-19 patients than severe influenza or

376

mild COVID-19 patients (Fig. 7B). Notably, NK cell reduction is associated with COVID-19

377

severity, whereas T cell depletion is a more dramatic perturbation in severe influenza. Within

378

these comparisons, the expansion of plasmablasts is consistently observed, whereas the

379

accumulation of platelets is unique to SARS-CoV-2 and in particular, to severe COVID-19

380

clinical status (Fig. 7B).

381
382

In addition to dynamic changes of cell ratios, we also investigated the regulation of immune

383

mediator genes across various diseases (Fig. 7C and table S7). IL-6 is an important factor of

384

cytokine storms in COVID-19 (63). As shown in the heatmap, naive B cells are the main sources

385

of IL-6 in COVID-19 patients while CD14+ monocytes show the highest expression levels in

386

severe influenza patients (Fig. 7C). Specific ligands, including CXCL2, CXCL3, CCL20 were

387

upregulated in both severe COVID-19 patients and severe influenza patients. CCR4 and IL2RA is

388

uniquely high in CD4+ T cells of COVID-19 patients. Interestingly, most PBMC myeloid cell

389

types displayed upregulated levels of interferon-stimulated genes in both COVID-19 and

390

influenza, especially in COVID-19, where highest levels of ISGs in CD14+ Monocytes, cDC and

391

pDC were observed.

Discussion

397

COVID-19 patients using the integrated single cell RNA-sequencing data and Topp-toolkit. By

398

virtue of systemic analysis of large sample size from multiple sampling sites, consistent

399

immunopathology-associated changes of cell abundance and transcriptional profiles were

400

observed in the circulating and lung immune repertoire of COVID-19 patients. The established

401

single cell atlas and the provided public portal (https://toppcell.cchmc.org/) enables the query of

402

candidate molecules and pathways in each of these processes.

In this work, we have constructed an innovative immune signature atlas of the blood and lung of

403
404

Leveraging this approach, we identified three major candidate mechanisms capable of driving

405

COVID-19 severity: (1) a cascade-like network of proinflammatory autocrine and paracrine

406

ligand receptor interactions among subtypes of differentiating mononuclear, lymphoid, as well as

407

other cell types; (2) the production of emergency platelets whose gene expression signatures

408

implicate significantly elevated potential for adhesion, thrombosis, attenuated fibrinolysis, and

409

potential to enhance the release of heparin-bound cytokines as well as further influence the

410

activation of neutrophils causing further inflammatory cell recruitment and neutrophil netosis; and

411

(3) the extrafollicular activation of naive and immature B cells via a multilineage network that

412

includes monocytic subtypes and exhausted T cells of cytokines and interleukins with the

413

potential to generate local antigen specific response to virus infected targets and collateral

414

autoimmunity. More details will be discussed below.

415
416

We identified dramatically expanded macrophages which were marked by the loss of HLA class

417

II genes and upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes. It implicates a key role for these

418

activated macrophages involved in signaling network and less so in activation of adaptive T cell

419

immunity. Among them, MoAM2 displayed hyperinflammatory responses and extraordinary high

420

levels of signaling molecules, which are involved in both autocrine (e.g. IL-6, CCL2, CCL4 and

421

CCL8) and paracrine (e.g. CXCL2, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11) signaling pathways. The

422

former pathway contributed to the self-stimulation and development, which amplified the

423

paracrine pathway for T cell and neutrophil chemoattraction. The latter two cell types in turn

424

activated MoAMs with cytokines genes (CCL5, IL10 of T cells and IL1B of neutrophils,

425

respectively). Based on the intercellular and multifactor complexity of the signaling cascade we

426

have outlined, to effectively control a malignant inflammatory cascade, it may be essential to

427

consider simultaneously targeting multiple nodes of this network of cytokines and interleukins. In

428

addition, HLA-DRlow monocytes, likely reflecting dysfunctional cells, were observed in severe

429

infection. This, along with evidence of emergency myelopoiesis with immature circulating

430

neutrophils into the circulation was detected in severe COVID-19. These neutrophils had

431

transcriptional programs suggestive of dysfunction and immunosuppression not seen in patients

432

with mild COVID-19. As such, we have presented evidence for the contribution of defective

433

monocyte activation and dysregulated myelopoiesis to severe COVID.

434
435

Platelet expansion is uniquely observed in COVID-19 versus other immune-mediated diseases.

436

Strikingly, these activated platelets were highlighted with abnormal thrombosis and upregulated

437

heparanase, a procoagulant endoglycosidase that cleaves anti-coagulation heparan sulfate

438

constituents on endothelial cells and potentially causes thrombotic vascular damages.

439

Additionally, heparanase-cleaved heparan sulphate (HS) fragments were capable of stimulating

440

the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL1B, IL6, IL8, IL10 and TNF through the

441

TLR-4 pathway in PBMC (64), further contributing to the hyperinflammatory environment in

442

COVID-19 patients. Since heparanase is recognized as a hallmark in tumor progression and

443

metastasis (65), we hypothesize COVID-19 infection could be associated with higher occurrence

444

of lung tumor metastasis. However, more data is required to support it. Pro-neutrophil secreted

445

proteins (e.g. ELANE, DEF4) of neutrophil extracellular trap (NET), which have been reported to

446

be associated with higher risk of morbid thrombotic events (66). Approaches to combatting NETs

447

could a potential anticoagulation treatment (67).

448
449

We propose a signaling network which potentially shapes the differentiation of B cells towards

450

the formation of autoantibodies. Proliferation and activation of inflammatory myeloid cells and

451

the formation of exhausted CD4+ T helper around an area of direct or indirect viral tissue injury

452

leads to the production of a set of interleukins and cytokines known to have both direct cell

453

activating and maturing effects on naïve and immature B cells. Previous report had revealed the

454

exaggerated extrafollicular B cell response, which is part of a mechanism that stimulates somatic

455

mutation and maturation of B cells to produce plasma cells with specificity for antigens present in

456

the vicinity of tissue damage sites (68). In the absence of macrophages or dendritic cells to restrict

457

self vs non-self, the presence of IL-10, IL-21, CXCL13 CXC10, IL-6 and others acting on

458

receptors present in naïve and immature B cells leads to the selection and maturation of self-

459

reactive maturation of B cells clones with formation of autoantibodies. Many of these COVID-19-

460

activated genes (e.g. CXCL13, CCL19, CCL20, TNFRSF13) are known to be genetically

461

associated with rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and risk of developing autoimmune disease in humans

462

and mouse models. The development of different patterns of autoimmunity may be the main

463

hallmark of “Long Haul” Covid disease and could explain why some individuals develop

464

different autoantibodies and suffer different forms of clinical consequences depending on which

465

antigens drive the B-cell maturation. Thus, an additional prediction that could be made based on

466

these findings and our network model is that among individuals treated with corticosteroids at the

467

time these auto-immunogenic processes are activated, there should be a protective effect and

468

lower likelihood of developing post acute sequela of COVID.

469
470

Consistent and varied compositional changes and gene patterns of immune cells were identified in

471

COVID-19, influenza and sepsis. Expansion of plasmablasts, as well as the reduction of non-

472

classical monocytes, are more significant changes in severe COVID-19 patients, while the

473

depletion of T cells is more dramatic in severe influenza patients. The accumulation is a unique

474

immune hallmark of COVID-19 within the selected diseases, which contributes to the coagulation

475

abnormalities and thrombosis, a key cause of fatality in COVID-19 patients. Different signaling

476

gene patterns were identified across immune-mediated diseases, with CCR4 only highly

477

expressed in CD4+ T cells of COVID-19 patients, which might be related with extravasation of

478

these cells (69). Upregulated interferon-stimulated genes of myeloid cells in PBMC revealed the

479

inflammatory environment of COVID-19.

480
481

Collectively, using the COVID-19 single cell atlas data exploration environment, we have

482

illustrated is that researchers are now enabled to systematically explore, learn, and formulate new

483

hypotheses within and between compartments, cell types, and biological processes, and provided

484

access to these reprocessed datasets through a suite of explorative and evaluative tools. Moreover,

485

we have shown different hypotheses can be developed and explored using the approaches that we

486

have outlined and the database that we have provided. Certainly additional critical information

487

will also be obtained using approaches that include in situ spatial, temporal data as well as those

488

of viral products and viral and inflammatory-process affected complexes. Next steps for

489

improving its ability to be mined more deeply will be based on additional statistical methods that

490

extend the current ToppCell / ToppGene Suite based on fuzzy measure similarity, Page-Rank, and

491

cell-cell signaling approaches.

492
493

There are several limitations in our study. Different studies used various standards of COVID-19

494

severity definition. To generalize conclusions, we simplified disease conditions into several

495

universal groups. Prospectively, a standardized definition of disease stages will assist to the

496

accuracy of future studies. Additionally, the timing of sample collection was not considered as a

497

variable in this study, rather disease stages were used to consolidate data across samples. We lack

498

follow-up data of patients with sequela, which will be helpful for understanding the long-haul

499

effects of the disease.

Materials and Methods

505

To have a comprehensive understanding of immune cells in different repertoires, we collected 8

506

public COVID-19 single-cell RNA-seq datasets of multiple compartments, including peripheral

507

blood mononuclear cells, bronchoalveolar lavage and lung biopsy, which in total covered over 43

508

healthy donors, 22 mild/moderate, 42 severe and 2 convalescent COVID-19 patients. More details

509

can be found in Fig. 1A and table S1. Lung biopsy samples were taken from the explanted lung or

510

post-mortem lungs of COVID-19 patients (70). Various criteria were used in these publications to

511

describe COVID-19 severity. For example, we found asymptomatic, mild, moderate and floor

COVID-19 patients under the definition of non-severe COVID-19 patients in our data sources. A

513

recent paper used the WHO score of COVID-19 severity to categorize disease conditions of

514

patients (26), which is a more standardized and robust approach for the description of disease

515

stages. However, in order to address the issue of missing information for disease stratification and

516

to simplify the comparison, we grouped disease conditions into three groups, including healthy

517

donors, mild COVID-19 patients and severe COVID-19 patients. Convalescent patients were

518

excluded in some of our analysis for simplification. Sequencing data of healthy donors in Guo et

519

al. was excluded since it was not from the same institute (14).

520

We also collected PBMC single-cell RNA-seq data from 29 sepsis patients (61) and 4 multiple

521

sclerosis (62) patients for comparative analysis of immune-mediated diseases (Fig. 1A and table

522

S1). Data sources can be found in Data Availability.

523
524

Data preprocessing and normalization

525

For datasets with raw UMI counts, we first removed cells with less than 300 detected genes or

526

less than 600 UMI counts. Then cells with more than 15% counts of mitochondrial genes were

527

filtered out. Genes expressed in less than 5 cells were removed. After quality control, we finally

528

harvested 483,765 high-quality cells from 8 studies (table S1). We normalized the total UMI

529

counts per gene to 1 million (CPM) and applied log2(CPM+1) transformation for heatmap

530

visualization and downstream differential gene expression analysis. Steps above were done in

531

Scanpy (71).

532

For some datasets that only provide processed and normalized h5ad or rds files, we checked their

533

preprocessing procedures in the original publications and confirmed that stringent quality control

534

procedures were used. Most of them used the default normalization approach in the Seurat or

535

Scanpy pipeline. We transferred them to log2(CPM+1) to make data consistently normalized. We

536

also prepared corresponding raw count files for data integration.

538

Integration of PBMC datasets and BAL datasets using Reciprocal PCA in Seurat

539

We input raw count files of 5 preprocessed PBMC datasets into Seurat and created a list of Seurat

540

objects. Reciprocal PCA procedure (https://satijalab.org/seurat/v3.2/integration.html#reciprocal-

541

pca) was used for data integration. First, normalization and variable feature detection were

542

applied for each dataset in the list. Then we used SelectIntegrationFeatures to select features for

543

downstream integration. Next, we scaled data and ran the principal component analysis with

544

selected features using ScaleData and RunPCA. Then we found integration anchors and integrated

545

data using FindIntegrationAchnors and IntegrateData. RPCA was used as the reduction method.

546

After integration, we scaled data and ran PCA on integrated expression values. UMAP was

547

generated using the top 30 reduced dimensions with RunUMAP. The same approach was also

548

used in BAL data integration and multi-disease integration. We also used it for the integration of

549

specific cell types across multiple datasets, for example, the integration of neutrophils from

550

PBMC and BAL datasets. Compared with standard workflow and SCTransform

551

(https://satijalab.org/seurat/v3.2/integration.html) in Seurat, we found Reciprocal PCA is much

552

less computation-intensive and time-consuming, making the integration of multiple large single-

553

cell datasets feasible.

554
555

Cell Annotations using canonical markers after unsupervised clustering

556

Cell annotations were assigned in each dataset and then mapped to the integrated data. For some

557

datasets without available cell annotations, we first used unsupervised clustering in Scanpy.

558

Detailed steps include (1) detecting top 3,000 highly variable genes using

559

pp.highly_variable_genes; (2) scaling each gene to unit variance on highly variable genes using

560

pp.scale; (3) running PCA using arpack approach in tl.pca; (4) finding neighbors using

561

pp.neighbors; (5) running leiden clustering with resolution of 1 using tl.leiden (resolutions were

562

determined swiftly based on the size and complexity of data). More details can be found in the

563

code. For datasets with available annotations, we checked their validity and corrected wrong

564

annotations. For example, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) were mistakenly

565

annotated as “SC&Eosinophil” in the original paper (11) and were corrected in our annotation.

566
567

After unsupervised clustering, well recognized immune cell markers were used to annotate

568

clusters, including CD4+ T cell markers such as TRAC, CD3D, CD3E, CD3G, CD4; CD8+ T cell

569

markers such as CD8A, CD8B, NKG7; NK cell markers such as NKG7, GNLY, KLRD1; B cell

570

markers such as CD19, MS4A1, CD79A; plasmablast markers such as MZB1, XBP1; monocyte

571

Cell Annotations using Azimuth

583

To better annotate T cells in our study, we applied Azimuth (https://satijalab.org/azimuth/), a tool

584

for reference-based single-cell analysis developed in Seurat version 4.0 (22). High-quality PBMC

585

single-cell data in Azimuth was used as the reference for label projection. After removing

586

annotations with low prediction scores or low mapping scores, we got a collection of well-

587

annotated T cell subtypes, including CD4+ Cytotoxic T cell, CD4+ Naive T cell, CD4+ Central

588

Memory T cell, CD8+ Naive T cell, CD8+ Effector Memory cell, gamma-delta T cell, double-

589

negative T cell. CD4+ Effector Memory T cell and CD8+ Central Memory T cell were found by

590

Azimuth but removed later because of low scores. Apart from annotations of T cell subtypes, we

591

also found CD56-bright NK cell, intermediate B cell and Memory B cell using Azimuth.

592
593

Sub-clustering for specific cell types

594

Sub-clustering was used for the discovery of subtypes or distinct stages of a specific cell type. In

595

our work, we applied sub-cluster for various immune cell types, including classical monocytes,

596

neutrophils, conventional dendritic, B cells and platelets. First, all cells in the specific cell type

597

were integrated using the same procedure as PBMC data integration. Then Louvain clustering

598

(resolution = 0.5, except for sub-clustering of classical monocytes where resolution = 0.3) was

599

applied to detect sub-clusters of those cells. Importantly, neutrophils, cDCs and B cells were

600

retrieved from both PBMC and BAL, whereas classical monocytes and platelets were only

601

retrieved from PBMC.

602
603

Generation of ToppCell gene modules

604

ToppCell (https://toppcell.cchmc.org/) was designed to parallelly analyze transcriptional profiles

605

of single-cell datasets by organizing differential expressed gene modules in a customized

606

hierarchical order. In our study, we hierarchically annotated cells with multiple layers, including

607

compartments, disease conditions, lineages, cell classes and sub-clusters. All the cells were

608

grouped into specific hierarchical categories. For example, “PBMC_severe COVID-19_myeloid

609

cells_classical-monocytes_cMono1” represents cells belonging to cMono1 (a sub-cluster of

610

classical monocytes) in PBMC of severe COVID-19 patients. With hierarchically ordered cell

611

annotations, we calculated their DEGs in a hierarchical way as well. We defined customized

612

ranges for comparisons and applied t-test based on normalized expression values. More details

613

can be seen on ToppCell website. Usually, the top 200 most differentially genes in each

614

comparison were picked up as the gene modules for the selected cell group, which are the starting

615

point of downstream analysis, including gene enrichment in ToppGene and interaction inference

616

in ToppCluster. All gene modules in our study were curated in COVID-19 Atlas

617

(https://toppcell.cchmc.org/biosystems/go/index3/COVID-19 Atlas) and ImmuneMap

618

(https://toppcell.cchmc.org/biosystems/go/index3/ImmuneMap) on the ToppCell website.

619
620

Gene Enrichment Analysis using ToppGene

621

Abundant gene modules were generated with ToppCell. After that, we used ToppGene

622

(https://toppgene.cchmc.org/) for gene enrichment analysis. Genes in each gene module were sent

623

to ToppGene platform as input for enrichment in different domains. GO-Molecular Function, GO-

624

Biological Process and GO-Cellular Component and Mouse Phenotype were usually used for

625

enrichment. P values of enrichment results were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg

626

procedure.

627
628

Generation of Functional Association Heatmap using ToppCluster

629

Genes in gene modules of selected cell types or sub-clusters were sent to ToppCluster

630

(https://toppcluster.cchmc.org/). Then multi-group functional enrichment was drawn for input

631

gene modules and -log10(adjusted p-value) was used as the gene enrichment score to represent the

632

strength of association between gene modules and pathways. Scores greater than 10 were trimmed

633

to 10. Pathways from Gene Ontologies, including Molecular Functions, Biological Process and

634

Cellular Component in the option list were used for the enrichment of gene modules in myeloid

635

cells, B cells and platelets. In order to gain a broader knowledge of immunothrombosis-related

636

pathways, “Pathway” and “Mouse Phenotype'' in the option list were also selected for enrichment.

637

Morpheus was used for visualization of the heatmap

638

(https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/).

639
640

Cell Interaction Inference in immunothrombosis activities and cytokine signaling pathways

641

CellChat was used to infer the signaling network in the BAL of severe patients (fig. S8B). All 3

642

categories of interactions were used in the database CellChatDB.human. Over-expressed ligands

643

or receptors in each cell type were first identified for further identification of over-expressed

644

interaction pairs. Then cytokine, chemokine and IL signaling probability between multiple cell

645

types was inferred using computeCommunProb and computeCommunProbPathway.

646
647

ToppCell was used to infer interactions in immunothrombosis. We first selected genes related to

648

coagulation or immunothrombosis pathways from subtypes of endothelial cells, platelets,

649

neutrophils, classical monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages by filtering the output of

650

ToppCluster (fig. S12A). Then we used CellChatDB as the knowledge base to find the subset of

651

genes participating in cell-cell interaction, including genes involved in signaling via secretion,

652

cell-cell contact and extracellular matrix interaction. These genes in each cluster were sent to

653

ToppCluster to infer the interaction network using protein-protein interactions (PPI) between

654

those genes.

655
656

Generation of Volcano Plots

657

We first calculated differential expressed genes using tl.rank_genes_groups in Scanpy. Adjusted

658

p values and log fold changes in the output were used as the input of volcano plots. R package

659

EnhancedVolcano (72) was used to draw figures.

660
661

Construction of COVID-19 Functional Enrichment Map

662

In order to characterize functional properties of cell types and subtypes observed in BAL, PBMC,

663

and lung parenchymal samples from control, mild, and severe COVID-19 patient samples, we

664

used the library of gene expression signatures (“Gene Module Report” from ToppCell) as an input

665

to the ToppCluster enrichment analyzer web server (Kaimal et al 2010). Using categories of Gene

666

Ontology, Human Phenotype, Mouse Phenotype, Pathway and Protein Interaction, a matrix was

667

constructed using minus log P enrichment values for each celltype gene list and then all cells and

668

enriched features could be clustered and ordered based on their shared or distinct properties that

669

could then be associated with lineage, cell subclass, tissue compartment, and disease state.

670
671

Statistics Analysis of Cell Proportion Changes in Different Disease Stages

672

Cell proportion differences between disease groups for specific types and subtypes (Fig. 2 and fig.

673

S2 to S4) shown on box plots were measured by Mann-Whitney test (Wilcoxon, paired=False).

674

Significance between two disease conditions were shown on the top.

675

To investigate the dynamic changes of cell proportions across various immune-mediated diseases,

676

we followed the approach in recent literature (12) (Fig. 7B). For each disease condition, we

677

computed the relative ratio of each cell type in individual disease samples divided by individual

678

healthy samples. Log2 transformed values were shown in the box plot. Then we calculated

679

relative ratios of each cell type between all sample pairs of healthy donors as a control. To

680

compute the significance, we used a two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test using relative

681

ratios in diseases and those values in healthy donors.
