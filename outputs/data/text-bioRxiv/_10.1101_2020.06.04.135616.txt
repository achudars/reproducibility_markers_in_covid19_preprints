Abstract
The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States created a unique situation

16

where multiple molecular diagnostic assays with various indications for use in the detection of

17

SARS-CoV-2 rapidly received Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA, were validated by

18

laboratories and utilized clinically, all within a period of a few weeks. We compared the

19

performance of four of these assays that were being evaluated for use at our institution: Abbott

20

RealTime m2000 SARS-CoV-2 Assay, DiaSorin Simplexa COVID-19 Direct, Cepheid Xpert

21

Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Abbott ID NOW COVID-19. Nasopharyngeal and nasal specimens

22

were collected from 88 ED and hospital-admitted patients and tested by the four methods in

23

parallel to compare performance. ID NOW performance stood out as significantly worse than

24

the other three assays despite demonstrating comparable analytic sensitivity. Further study

25

determined that the use of a foam nasal swab compared to a nylon flocked nasopharyngeal swab,

26

as well as use in a population chronically vs. acutely positive for SARS-CoV-2, were significant

27

factors in the poor comparable performance.

28

Introduction

29

The rapid onset of COVID-19 in the United States resulted in an accelerated pace of both

30

SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) development and FDA Emergency Use

31

Authorization (EUA) approvals. Clinical microbiology laboratories that typically would take

32

weeks to evaluate and verify performance characteristics for a FDA approved diagnostic test had

33

little choice but to perform abbreviated validation and/or verification studies of assays,

34

benchmarked against limited FDA EUA performance data, in a matter of days. The sheer

35

volume of COVID-19 test requests from different patient populations, different specimen types,

36

and with different turnaround time needs demanded that laboratories implement more than one

37

type of NAAT to respond to the crisis.

38

SARS-CoV-2 testing in our laboratory began with the CDC EUA assay performed on

39

Abbott m2000, but due to that assay’s significant throughput constraints (24 specimens in 8

40

hours), we quickly verified and switched to the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA Assay

41

(m2000) once released (94 specimens in ~8 hours). Although this assay provided capacity for

42

our outpatient testing needs, we also verified the DiaSorin Simplexa COVID-19 Direct

43

(Simplexa) assay, capable of resulting 8 specimens in 90 minutes, and used this assay as a rapid

44

turn-around time (TAT) option for our inpatient and emergency department (ED) populations.

45

Within a few weeks, additional SARS-CoV-2 NAAT options emerged that were specifically

46

designed for rapid testing of patients in the point of care setting: the Cepheid Xpert Xpress

47

SARS-CoV-2 (Xpert) assay, which could provide results in 45 minutes, and the Abbott ID NOW

48

COVID-19 (ID NOW) assay, ultimately approved for direct nasal, nasopharyngeal and throat

49

swab testing only, with results in 5-15 minutes.

50

In the absence of clinical trials and a gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, the clinical

51

performance of SARS-CoV-2 assays is unclear. Anecdotal claims of poor NAAT performance

52

exist in the lay press, and limited studies have shown variable performance of rapid POC tests

53

(1-9). As a surrogate for a gold standard, a composite reference standard (CRS) can be used to

54

determine the consensus of comparable assays and identify outlier assays in terms of clinical

55

performance (10). Using this approach, our goal was to evaluate the performance—in parallel—

56

of three NAATs from nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs in M4-RT viral transport medium (VTM)

57

(m2000, Xpert, Simplexa) and an NAAT assay performed directly from a nasal swab (ID NOW).

Methods

60

Accuracy Study Design

61

From 4/22 – 5/5/2020, specimens were collected from 88 ED and hospital admitted

62

patients and tested for SARS-CoV-2 on the RealTime m2000 SARS-CoV-2 Assay (Abbott

63

Molecular, Des Plaines, IL), Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct (DiaSorin, Cypress, CA), Xpert®

64

Xpress SARS-CoV-2 (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) and ID NOW COVID-19 (Abbott Molecular,

65

Des Plaines, IL) within 24 hours of collection. Each assay was performed according to

66

manufacturer’s EUA instructions.

67

NP and nasal swabs were collected from 88 patients, of which 75 were patients

68

presenting in the ED and 13 were from a population of recovering COVID-positive inpatients.

69

NP specimen collection, transport to the hospital-based core microbiology laboratory in M4-RT

70

viral transport medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Diego, CA; VTM) and subsequent testing

71

by Simplexa was performed as a part of routine clinical care. Residual NP specimen in VTM

72

was stored at 4°C, transported to our offsite main laboratory, and within 24 hours of collection,

73

used for comparative study testing by m2000 and Xpert assays. At the time of NP swab

74

collection, nasal swabs were collected in parallel from each of these patients and transported dry

75

to the offsite main laboratory in a sealed sterile collection bag, stored at 4°C and tested by ID

76

NOW within 24 hours, consistent with the package insert procedure.

77

In order to determine a percent agreement amongst the methods, we established a

78

composite reference standard as defined by result agreement of SARS-CoV-2 target in at least 2

79

of 4 NAAT results. Agreement for each individual assay was compared to this standard.

Analytic Limit of Detection Study Design
Dilutions were prepared from ZeptoMetrix inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus (1.70 x 105

84

TCID50/ml) that was internally quantified to 109.62 copies/mL relative to a standard curve of

85

AccuPlex™ SARS-CoV-2 Reference Material (SeraCare) constructed on the m2000 assay. From

86

that stock, dilutions were made in VTM (1,042, 521, 260, 130, 65 and 32.5 copies/mL) and

87

tested on the m2000, Simplexa, and Xpert SARS-CoV-2 assays. A separate set of ZeptoMetrix

88

dilutions in VTM were made so that when added to the 2.5 ml of elution buffer in the ID NOW

89

receiver cup, equivalent concentrations were achieved (1,042, 522, 262, 105 and 53 copies/mL).

90

In this way, the concentrations of viral copies in the ID NOW buffer were equivalent to the VTM

91

dilutions used for the other three instruments. Five replicates at each dilution were tested.

92
93
94

Results & Discussion
Nasal swabs directly tested on the ID NOW assay had 48% positive agreement compared

95

to the CRS, whereas Simplexa had 88%, m2000 had 96% and Xpert had 100% positive

96

agreement (Table 1). While the deficit in positive percent agreement (PPA) seen in ID NOW

97

test results is consistent with other early release studies in the scientific literature ((1-4, 7-9)), it

98

is surprising given the ID NOW’s LOD claim of 125 genome equivalents/mL, which is similar to

99

the 100 copies/mL claimed by the m2000 method, 250 copies/mL claimed by Xpress and 242

100

copies/mL claimed by Simplexa. To clarify this apparent discrepancy, a direct assessment of the

101

analytic sensitivity of all assays in this comparison was performed utilizing dilutions of

102

inactivated SARS-CoV-2 whole virus (ZeptoMetrix). In this limited LOD study, we found each

103

assay had comparable LODs to the reported LOD data in their package insert, including the LOD

104

of the ID NOW assay, as shown in Table 2.

105

Similarities in the LODs among the assays suggest that other factors contribute to the

106

differences in comparative performance when testing clinical specimens. When additional ID

107

NOW testing was performed on the 25 NP VTM specimens that were positive based on the CRS,

108

6 additional patients were detected that were negative by nasal swab testing. This suggests that

109

testing an NP swab in VTM on ID Now may have better performance than a direct nasal swab,

110

as use of the NP VTM improves the PPA from 48% to 64%. However, testing an NP swab in

111

VTM was recently removed as an approved source from the original ID NOW package insert

112

based on concerns about false negatives, whereas a nasal swab is provided as an approved

113

collection device. The sensitivity issues leading up to that removal may have less been due to

114

VTM than the quality of a nasal specimen itself when compared to a NP specimen. Further

115

studies should be conducted directly comparing the performance of direct (not placed in VTM)

116

NP swabs on the ID NOW to NP swabs in VTM tested by other NAATs.

117

An important variable in our study is that two distinct population groups were analyzed.

118

Thirteen of the 88 patient specimens collected were from an inpatient population of recovering

119

COVID positive patients, with a mean time from initial COVID-19 diagnosis of 25.8 days. A

120

comparison of the m2000 Ct values obtained from m2000 positive samples from inpatients (red)

121

and ED patients (black) and by ID NOW result is shown in Figure 1. The mean m2000 Ct value

122

for the ID NOW positive specimens was 14.3 versus a significantly higher mean m2000 Ct value

123

22.29 (p-value < 0.001) for the ID NOW negative specimens. Inpatients had significantly lower

124

Ct values as measured by Abbott m2000 Ct (n=9, mean Ct 21.6) than positive specimens

125

collected from patients presenting at the ED (n=16, mean Ct 16.3, p-value 0.04). As the majority

126

of ID NOW negative/m2000 positive specimens (8 of 12) were from this inpatient population of

127

low Ct positives, the overall performance of the ID NOW assay was substantially impacted. To

128

assess test performance in a more typical use case in a POC setting, we reanalyzed percent

129

agreement for all assays using only ED patients. While still notably lower than the other assays,

130

the PPA of ID NOW increased from 48 to 69%, whereas performance of the other assays was

131

nearly identical (Table 1b).

132

This comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 NAATs utilizing the m2000, Simplexa, Xpert

133

and ID NOW assays demonstrated that significant performance deficits were found in the ID

134

NOW assay when tested in a mixed patient population using both NP and nasal specimens.

135

Based on a CRS, use of the m2000, Xpert, and Simplexa assays for NP specimens in VTM are

136

likely to have similar performance in clinical practice and choice of implementation can be made

137

based on considerations of turnaround time, throughput, work flow and cost. In contrast, despite

138

the ID NOW assay claiming and demonstrating comparable (differences < 1 log10) analytic LOD

139

findings to the other assays tested, the lower detection rate of the ID NOW from nasal samples

140

must be considered when deciding on a use case. When limiting our data set to an acute ED

141

patient population and comparing results from the same specimen type (NP in VTM),

142

performance of ID NOW was improved but still demonstrated lower performance compared to

143

the other assays tested. In situations where the 5-15 minute turn-around time of the ID NOW

144

provides distinct advantages, it is critical that the most appropriate specimen type, appropriate

145

patient population and need for more sensitive confirmatory NAAT testing be assessed prior to

146

use.
