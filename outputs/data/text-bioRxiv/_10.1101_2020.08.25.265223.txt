Abstract: The newly identified pathogenic human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, led to an atypical
pneumonia-like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak called coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19). Currently, nearly 23 million cases have been confirmed worldwide with the
highest COVID-19 cases been confirmed in the United States. As there is no vaccine or any
effective interventions, massive efforts to create a potential vaccine to combat COVID-19 is
underway. In the meantime, safety precautions and effective disease control strategies appear to
be vital for preventing the virus spread in the public places. Due to the longevity of the virus on
smooth surfaces, photocatalytic properties of self-disinfecting/cleaning surfaces appear to be a
promising tool to help guide disinfection policies to control infectious SAR-CoV-2 spread in
high-traffic areas such as hospitals, grocery stores, airports, schools, and stadiums. Here, we
explored the photocatalytic properties of nanosized TiO2 (TNPs) as induced by the UV radiation,
towards virus deactivation. Our preliminary results using close genetic relative of SAR-CoV-2,
HCoV-NL63, showed the virucidal efficacy of photoactive TNPs deposited on glass coverslips,
as examined by quantitative RT-PCR and virus culture assays. Efforts to extrapolate the
underlying concepts described in this study to SARS-CoV-2 are currently underway.
1. Introduction
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV), causative agent of the pneumonia-like
COVID-19 pandemic, has infected more than 23 million people globally [1]. Due to extremely
transmissible nature of COVID-19 and limited available intensive care unit (ICU) management,
over 800,000 people have lost their life to this fatal SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, worldwide [2]. The
highest rate of mortality is found among individuals aged 65 and over [3], whereas the death rate
continues to decrease, but still a concern among persons aged 85 years and over [4,5]. Devastating
consequences of COVID-19 infection and lack of a vaccine or effective antivirals against SARS-

CoV-2 warrants scientific research on this newly identified coronavirus for developing
therapeutics and interventions to control viral spread.
One of the main reasons for the observed surge in COVID-19 cases could be attributed to
multiple modes of virus dissemination, including direct contact with infected person through
respiratory droplets generated during coughing, sneezing, or talking, and indirect contact with
contaminated surfaces or objects used by infected persons [6,7]. Analysis of 1070 specimens from
multiple sites of 205 COVID-19-infected patients revealed the presence of viral load in urine,
nasal, blood, sputum, and fecal samples [8]. Additionally, stability of SARS-CoV-2 in the
environment also contributes to its spread [7]. Supporting the assumption of non-aerosol virus
transmission are documented COVID-19 cases, which could be explained by direct contact [9].
Due to the risk of nosocomial spread, clinical management of critically ill patients and infection
prevention among health-care workers and non-COVID-19-infected patients requires the
continuous use of personal protection and decontamination practices [10]. In addition, World
Health Organization (WHO), recommends that maintaining physical distancing, frequent handwashing and cleaning of the contaminated surfaces reduces the chance of contracting COVID-19
infection [11].
COVID-19 pandemic brought the importance of environmental hygiene and cleaning
practices to prevent viral spread. COVID-19 virus was detected on multiple surfaces in the near
proximity to patient’s bed as well as in the sink and the toilet bowl [12]. Investigation of the
hospital cluster of cases identified respiratory droplets as the main source of the significant
environmental contamination [13]. In another study, transmission of the virus via fomites (e.g.
elevator buttons and public restrooms) was suggested in the cluster of COVID-19 cases in a mall
in Wenzhou, China [14] as analyzed by real time RT-PCR. However, detection of viral RNA in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.25.265223; this version posted August 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

the environmental samples based on PCR-based arrays may not always indicate the presence of
viable virus that could be transmitted. It is especially important to evaluate the pathogen survival
in the environment as the COVID-19 virus was shown to retain the infectivity for up to 72 hours
on the stainless steel and plastic surfaces, commonly used in the medical settings [7].
The best way to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is to reduce the viral spread.
Strategies to control the spread include use of hand-sanitizers, facemasks, physical distancing, selfisolation of patients, regular cleaning of shared surfaces, and frequent use of disinfectants. Since
fomites are one of the ways of virus transmission, it is crucial to identify methods that could reduce
virus survival on the surfaces. In this regard, generation of self-disinfecting surfaces based on the
advanced oxidation processes/photocatalysis initiated by ultraviolet (UV) radiation will be of great
importance. UV irradiation-based methods are powerful disinfectants due to its germicidal ability
and have shown effectiveness in reducing infections caused by pathogens. Additionally, nanosized
titanium dioxide (TiO2-nanoparticles or TNPs) have been proven to act as effective photocatalysts
and shown to have both bactericidal and virucidal properties [15]. The anti-viral effect of TiO2 has
been demonstrated against influenza virus [16], which is transmitted via aerosol and causes
respiratory tract infection, similar to COVID-19 [17]. However, the anti-viral efficacy of TiO2
against human coronavirus remains largely unknown.
In this study, we sought to determine the disinfection ability of TNPs using an in vitro
approach. Our data demonstrate that the photocatalytic properties of TNPs are highly effective in
inactivating human coronavirus, HCoV-NL63 by reducing the viral genomic RNA stability and
virus infectivity. HCoV-NL63 is an alpha coronavirus, which causes acute respiratory distress
symptoms (ARDS) among infected individuals [18]. This virus is a Bio Safety Level 2 pathogen
and has high similarity with SARS-CoV-2, therefore was used as a surrogate to determine the

efficacy of TNPs in virus disinfection [19]. Our results demonstrated that TNP coatings drastically
increase the efficacy of HCoV-NL63 inactivation and even a very brief exposure of UV can
effectively eliminate infectious virus or viral genomic RNA. Additionally, the efficacy of TNP
coatings, in inactivating the virus, was retained at multiple humid environments, suggesting this
to be an effective measure for providing clean/disinfected surfaces in public and hospital settings.
In conclusion, this study provides conclusive evidence that surfaces coated with TNPs, a non-toxic
thin layer applied as paint, can enhances surface disinfection from human coronaviruses.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Cells
Vero E6 and HEK293L cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium
(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Atlanta Biologicals), 2 mM Lglutamine, 25 U/mL penicillin, and 25 µg/mL streptomycin. Cells were grown at 370C in a
humidified chamber supplemented with 5% CO2.
2.2. Human coronavirus
HCoV-NL63 strain, is a human coronavirus and belongs to the family of alpha coronaviruses.
HCoV-NL63 was obtained from BEI Resources (1.6x106 TCID50/ml; lot 70033870, NIAID, NIH)
and propagated in Vero cells by infecting the Vero cell monolayer with HCoV-NL63 for 2 h.
Unattached virus was removed by washing followed by addition of fresh medium. After seven
days, virus was harvested, cell debris removed by centrifugation, and virus was quantified by
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). All the assays were conducted under the biosafety level
2+ (BSL-2+) containment.

2.3. TiO2 nanoparticles
(TNPs)-coated glass coverslips. TiO2 was a generous gift from Degussa Corporation (Degussa
Corp. Piscataway, NJ). TNPs suspension (300 µg/mL) was prepared in deionized (DI) water and
vortexed. An aliquot (600 µL) of TNPs was placed on the clean UV-treated glass coverslip and
dried at 600C, which resulted into a semi-transparent coating. TNPs-coated coverslips were stored
at room temperature (RT) until further use.
2.4. UV Photocatalysis
An aliquot of HCoV-NL63 virus (100 µL, Median Tissue Culture Infectious dose (TCID50)
was placed on TNPs-coated and uncoated coverslips (18 mm diameter, 1017.88 mm2) and exposed
to the USHIO Germicidal Lamp (model G30T8), which generates UV-C light (wavelength:
254nm, 99V, 30W, 0.355A) for various time points. The UV light source was placed 76 cm, 50
cm and 10 cm from the bottom of the wells containing coverslips, which applied calculated 2900
µW/cm2, 4300 µW/cm2 and 13000 µW/cm2 energies, respectively (where µW = 10-6J/s). Virus
inactivation was also analyzed under different humidity environments, 45%, 65% and 85% relative
humidity, by applying a known amount of virus on TNPs coated and uncoated cover-slips placed
under indicated humidity. The humidity conditions were generated by using humidifier placed
inside the biological safety cabinet (BSL2) and the humidity was measured using AcuRite Indoor
Thermometer and Hygrometer with Humidity Gauge (Acurite, Inc.). Humidity range (45-85%)
was selected based on the average (45%) standard in-door humidity recommended by Center for
Disease control and Prevention (CDC) and the outdoor humidity registered in many parts of the
world including coastal areas, which can have humidity as high as high as 85% [20] [21]. Virus
from the TNP coated surfaces were recovered and used for total RNA extraction or applied onto a
permissive, human embryonic kidney (HEK293L) cell monolayer for the detection of infectious

virus. To ensure the efficacy of the virions recovery from TNP surfaces, cover slips were incubated
with PBS at 37oC for 30min (3x) and combined before using for infection assays. Total RNA was
extracted by adding Trizol reagent directly onto the coverslip to collect RNA from all the viruses.
2.5. Virus Infectivity assay
HEK293L cell monolayer was inoculated with HCoV-NL63 virus aliquot for 2 h (370C, 5%
CO2). Cells were washed to remove the unbound virus followed by addition of fresh medium. 48
h post-infection, monolayers were harvested adding Tizol reagent onto the cells and used for total
RNA extraction.
2.6. RNA extraction and qPCR
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendation. An aliquot of RNA (1 µg) was used for synthesizing the cDNA
(Superscript kit; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). cDNA (2µL) was used for the relative quantification
of viral genome RNA in a qPCR assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Primers used in
this

are

NL63-SF

5’-GTGCCATGACCGCTGTTAAT-3’

and

NL63-SR

5’-

GCGGACGAACAGGAATCAAA-3’. For generating a standard curve to estimate the viral
copies, 100 µl of NL63 (BEI resources) stock with known amounts of HCoV-NL63 was used for
total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. An aliquot (2µl) of HCoV-NL63 cDNA used for qRTPCR was equivalent to 320 copies of HCoV-NL63 (1.6x106 TCID50/ml; lot 70033870, NIAID,
NIH). Several ten-fold dilutions of this isolated genomic RNA (BEI Resources) was used for
generating a standard curve. The sensitivity of qPCR assay was 3.2 virions in the sample based on
calculations using RNA extracted from the BEI NL63 virus stock.
2.7. Experimental setup

In order to test the efficacy of TNPs in accelerating the inactivation of HCoV-NL63 upon
exposure to UV-light, a suspension of TNPs was prepared and deposited on glass coverslips as a
semitransparent film. TNP-coated coverslips were then placed in the center of a 60 mm culture
dish and an aliquot of HCoV-NL63 virus was applied on the top of coverslips, followed by
exposure to UV emitting lamps for the selected time duration. After TNP/UV-treatment, the
inactivated virus was collected and evaluated for the viral genomic RNA stability and virus
infectivity. The experimental plan depicting these steps is presented as a graphical image (Figure.
1).

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the experimental set up utilized for the evaluation of photocatalytic inactivation
of HCoV-NL63. TiO2 nanoparticles (TNPs) were prepared as a suspension in water and deposited on glass coverslips
by drying at 600C for 4-5 h. An aliquot (100 µL) with calculated virions of HCoV-NL63 was placed on the TNP-coated
coverslips and exposed to UV for indicated times. The TNP/UV-treated virus was then collected to determine the viral
RNA stability and infectivity via quantitative RT-PCR, infectivity and the detection of viral protein through
immunofluorescence assay in HEK293L cells.

2.8. Immunofluorescence analysis
Cells were fixed using 3:1 methanol:acetone and stored at -800C until used. Slides were
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min, washed (3x) and blocked (3% normal donkey

serum, 0.5% BSA) for 1h at RT. Cell monolayers were washed again (3x) and incubated with
rabbit anti-CoV antibody (1:200; BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH) for 1h at RT, followed by
incubation with goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (1:5000; Molecular Probe, Carlsbad, CA),
secondary antibody for 1h at RT in the dark. Finally, the nuclei were stained with TOPRO-3
(ThermoFisher, Walthman, MA). Coverslips were mounted on the glass slides using antifade and
the slides were examined using Carl Zeiss LSM 780 confocal laser-scanning microscope.

2.9. Statistical analysis
Data presented are an average of three independent experiments and the error bars represent
standard deviation. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 8.0 software (Graphpad Inc.)
and the p-values were calculated using 2-way ANOVA and the p-values are *, <0.1; and ** <0.01.
3. Results
3.1. The effect of UV light exposure on HCoV-NL63 virus stability.
HCoV-NL63 virus (100 µL suspension) was applied onto the coverslip placed inside the wells
of 12-well plate. The plate containing HCoV-NL63 viruses was exposed, after removing the cover,
to the UV light inside a BSL-2 biological safety cabinet for 0, 1, 5, 10- and 30-min. UV-exposed
virus was collected for the evaluation of virus inactivation by direct genomic RNA quantitation
(qRT-PCR) and infectivity assay on HEK293L monolayer. Total RNA was extracted and
quantified for genomic RNA fragmentation due to cross-linking and oxidative damage by UV
exposure (Fig. 2A). HCoV-NL63 viral copies were calculated using standard curve generated on
the basis of serial dilutions of known HCoV-NL63 genomic RNA. Expectedly, the calculated
copies of the viral genomic RNA declined with UV-exposure (Fig. 2A). Importantly, we saw an

efficient reduction in the number of intact viral genomic RNA even at 1 min exposure to the UVlight but there were still some intact copies of HCoV-NL63, at least in the region (spike protein)
used for detection in our qPCR assay (Fig. 1). Increasing the exposure time to 5, 10 and 30 min,
completely degraded the genomic RNA of HCoV-NL63, below the detection limit, confirming
efficient inactivation of viruses with UV (Fig. 2A). Since, the qRT-PCR determines the intactness
of genomic RNA, we further determined whether the UV-treatment reduced the infectivity of
HCoV-NL63 virus. To this end, UV exposed HCoV-NL63 viruses were added onto HEK293L cell
monolayer for 2 h to facilitate attachment and infection. Total RNA collected 48 hpi (hour post
infection) was used for the detection of HCoV-NL63 genomic RNA, to measure the levels of any
residual live virus in UV exposed samples (Fig. 2B). Our data showed that UV-exposure to 5-min
and longer completely eliminated all infectious viruses (Fig. 2B). However, we detected some
infectious viruses of HCoV-NL63, although significantly reduced, at 1 min UV exposure,
suggesting 1-min exposure is insufficient in inactivating the virus completely (Fig. 2B).

for the detection of replicated viral copies in a qRT-PCR assay. Viral copies were calculated based on a standard curve
generated using the known amounts of virus obtained from BEI Resources.

3.2. TNP coating efficiently inactivated HCoV-NL63 even at brief exposures.
Next, we sought to determine whether the photocatalytic activity of TNPs can
facilitate/enhance the efficacies of virus inactivation. In order to do that, we exposed HCoV-NL63
virus with UV on the surfaces coated with TNPs, which was achieved by depositing nanosized
TNPs (600 µl) onto the coverslip (2.5 cm2 surface area) (Fig. 1). HCoV-NL63 coronavirus (100
µL) was applied onto TNPs-coated and control coverslips (uncoated) placed inside the wells of
12-well plate and exposed to the UV light for indicated times. We quantified the number of intact
HCoV-NL63 genomic RNA through RT-qPCR and infectious viral particles, as described above.
Importantly, the viral copies quantified through RT-qPCR for viral genome fragmentation showed
significantly reduced (almost to the background level) copies of the HCoV-NL63 from the TNP
coated surface as compared to the control (uncoated surface) even at 1-min of UV-exposure (Fig.
3).

virus aliquot (100µL) was placed on glass coverslips treated with or without TiO2 and exposed to UV light for 1, 5- and 10min. Post-UV treatment, HCoV-NL63 was collected for viral RNA extraction. Intact viral copies were calculated based on
the standard curve generated above. On top, coverslips without and with TiO2 are presented; (B). Post-UV treatment, HCoVNL63 virus was collected and subjected to the infection of HEK293L monolayer. Viral protein, indicator of virus infectivity
and replication, was detected by immune localization through IFA (green fluorescent dots). A) NL63 infection (positive

without TiO2; E) uninfected control (negative control); F) 1 min UV light exposure with TiO2; G) 5 min UV light exposure
with TiO2; H) 10 min UV light exposure with TiO2.

Slight variation in the number of HCoV-NL63 at 0 min UV-exposure could be because of the
anti-microbial property of TNP even in the absence of UV exposure. Expectedly, the number of
intact HCoV-NL63 genomic RNA was almost to the background levels at longer UV-exposure
with and without TNPs (Fig. 3A). To correlate virus inactivation with infectivity, viruses recovered
after UV-exposure were added onto the monolayer of HEK293L cells. The infectious viral copies
were determined by localizing the protein of HCoV-NL63 through immunofluorescence assay,
which is produced following replication of any residual virus. As a control of infection and
replication, HCoV-NL63 was added onto HEK293L cells, and stained for viral protein to
demonstrate the functionality of our assay. Detection of signals in HCoV-NL63 infected cells but
not in uninfected, control confirmed the specificity of our assay (Fig. 3B, compare panel A with
E). Our data showed that viruses from TNPs coated surfaces were completely inactivated even at
1 min exposure to UV-light, while surfaces without TNPs coatings had detectable levels of
infectious virus, demonstrated by viral proteins (Fig. 3B, compare panels B and F). Longer
exposure to UV completely inactivated the virus demonstrated by a lack of protein localization in
the HEK293L infected cells (Fig. 3B, panels C, D, G, H). These data confirmed that TNPs can
enhance the inactivation efficacies and brief exposure to UV-light can effectively degrade HCoVNL63 virus rendering them non-infectious.
3.3. Reducing the exposure distance and relative humidity enhanced HCoV-NL63 inactivation.
We further determined whether decreasing the distance of UV-source from the
contaminated surface will reduce the exposure time for complete disinfection. To this end, we

detectable viral genome at 1 min exposure. Importantly, TiO2 significantly decreased the
exposure time to 0.5min to achieve almost complete disinfection of the surfaces (Fig. 4A).
Further decreasing the distance of exposure to 10 cm, inactivated the virus very quickly to
almost background levels even in less than 0.5 min both TiO2 coated and uncoated surfaces
(Fig. 4A). However, it is practically not possible and unsafe to expose surfaces with that high
intensity of UV for microbial inactivation in big spaces and buildings. Therefore, we
performed our assays at previously used distance (76 cm distance with 2,900µM/cm2) for our
experiments determining the effects of relative humidity on HCoV-Nl63 inactivation on TNP
coated surfaces. Virus placed on TNP coated and uncoated coverslips were placed under three
different relative humidity and exposed to UV for indicated times. Our results showed that
increase in the relative humidity enhances HCoV-NL63 inactivation even on normal surfaces
(Fig. 4B). Importantly, TNP coating enhanced the inactivation of HCoV-NL63 virus at all
three tested relative humidity (Fig. 4B). This confirmed that surface inactivation of viruses
can be achieved with shorter UV exposure on TNP coated surfaces and the humidity enhances
the photocatalytic activity of TiO2.
4. Discussion
Lack of anti-COVID-19 vaccine and highly contagious nature of SARS-CoV-2 highlights the
need for environmental control of viral spread. Stability of virus in different environmental
conditions [22] and ability to spread far distances made this virus exceptionally successful in
dissemination within the human population [23,24]. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly stable on
smooth surfaces for up to 72h and in a wide range of pH conditions (pH 3-10) at room temperature
(220C) [24]. Virus can spread on surfaces by direct contact or aerosol droplets. The small size
droplets (10µm) can become airborne and circulate in the air for an extended period of time

carrying the infectious virus to far distances [25]. They may be dispersed widely by air
contaminating the environment far distant from the patient. Therefore, decontaminating surfaces
is essential to combat COVID-19 spread.
Nanosized TiO2/TNPs have photocatalytic properties, which are shown to control microbial
growth [15,26]. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity is based on the excitation of the
electron/e- from the valence band to the conduction band and the generation of the “electron-hole
(e—h+)” [27]. The free electron can contribute to production of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)
including O2- and OH- radicals [28]. These ROS can react in the solution producing highly potent
anti-microbial H2O2. The TNPs can be used in suspension, liquids or immobilized on surfaces,
also referred as a “self-cleaning“ surfaces [29]. This feature of TNPs could provide a microbial
control in addition to conventional disinfecting products. TNP’s anti-viral effect has been shown
against influenza virus, Newcastle virus, hepatitis B virus and herpesviruses [30-33]. TiO2 was
proposed to have antiviral effect, targeting both DNA and RNA viruses, airborne and blood borne
pathogens. The photocatalytic titanium apatite filter was earlier shown to inactivate SARS
coronavirus up to 99.99% after 6 h exposure [34]. Our assay to use TiO2 coating to efficiently
inactivate human coronavirus with UV light through very brief exposure highlights the importance
of TNP coatings on publicly used surfaces. Although, UV by itself are used for viral inactivation
including the trains of public transport systems but the efficacies are not well established. Since
our assays showed augmentation of virus inactivation, HCoV-NL63 by the TNPs coatings under
UV exposure, we propose that TNP coatings can enhance virus inactivation including SARS-CoV2 on surfaces most frequently exposed with COVID-19 patients. HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2
both cause acute respiratory diseases and have similar virion structure (HCoV) [18,35], we
speculate that these inactivation parameters will be same for the both viruses.

Various factors are shown to affect virus resistance to UV light exposure, including UV dose,
humidity and the surface material [36,37]. It was reported that the virus survival decreases with an
increase in the UV energy [38]. Recently, Buonnano et al have demonstrated that alpha and beta
coronaviruses are susceptible to the low dose of the UV light exposure, where 90% of virus
inactivation was achieved in 8 minutes [39]. The UV light susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 was also
demonstrated, confirming the virucidal effect of the UV light [40]. In both studies, the effect of
the higher UV light intensity was shown to have more virucidal effect, as expected [39,40]. In line
with these data, we have shown the beta coronavirus is susceptible to the UV radiation and that
this effect is directly proportional to the UV-light intensity. The most interesting observation is
that TiO2 can facilitate virucidal effect of the low intensity UV light, which could have important
practical application. As TiO2 can maintain antiviral efficacy of the UV light at the lower intensity,
it will help in reducing the potential harmful effect of radiation exposure [41].
Interestingly, TiO2 nanoparticles effectively inactivated HCoV-NL63 under all three tested
relative humidity conditions, which are within the standard for the indoor conditions (30-60%)
[42]. We have shown that TiO2 nanoparticles retain virucidal efficacy even at very high humid
condition (85% relative humidity), confirming a broader use of TNPs coatings on outdoor surfaces.
The environmental humidity was suggested to play a role in the airborne virus spread [43-45]. It
is postulated that humid environment contributes to the size of droplets and the stability of the
virions [25,46]. A prolonged survival of the airborne viruses was demonstrated in the lower humid
conditions [44,47]. Study by Wu et al have demonstrated a negative correlation between COVID19 cases and humidity levels [48]. Study published by Matson et al [49], showed that lower
humidity combined with lower temperature prolonged the half-life of virus in nasal mucosa.

Matson et al also stated that virus is maintained in the climate controlled environment with relative
humidity 40%, for 24 hours [49].
A presumed model to understand the underlying mechanism involved in the photocatalytic
inactivation of HCoV-NL63 has been described in Fig. 5. In the presence of UV radiation, TiO2
nanoparticles act as photocatalyst due to their specific energy structure. UV-irradiation of
nanosized TiO2 results in the excitation of electron leading to the formation of a specific “electronhole (e--h+)” pair and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The electron holes (h+) catalyze
oxidation processes and convert water/hydroxide molecules to peroxide/hydroxyl radicals,
whereas electrons (e-) induce reduction reactions and react with molecular oxygen to generate
superoxide radicals. These resulting ROS have the ability to inactivate the virus through oxidative
damage.

Figure 5. Schematic illustration of photocatalytic inactivation of HCoV-NL63 principle. Irradiation with UV light
generates specific “electron-hole (e--h+)” pair, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydroxyl and superoxide
radicals on the surface of TNPs. These ROS have strong oxidative ability, which can inactivate the virus due to oxidative
damage.

Since, TiO2 is non-toxic and used as a food additives [50], although at low quantities, TNPs
long-term effects on human health has not been evaluated. Therefore, a well-controlled toxicology
studies along with approvals from the environmental protection agency and associated regulatory

bodies may be needed, before using the TNPs on commonly used surfaces. TNPs have many
advantages as compared to conventional germicidal products including its low cost and chemical
stability [51]. Additionally, they do not require multiple applications as they could be coated single
time on various surfaces [52,53]. In fairness, TNPs can be applied as a paint on the surfaces in the
form of immobilized thin coatings on high risk facilities including train stations and other public
areas to reduce the surface contamination and any possible exposures. It is obvious advantage of
TNPs that they have a broad range of anti-microbial efficacy including virucidal, bactericidal and
fungicidal [15]. This is especially beneficial in the areas with high risk of exposure to biohazardous
material, such as hospitals. Additionally, this may be useful in hospital settings including the ICUs
handling COVID-19 patients, where TNP coatings of the hospital floors can provide an effective
way of inactivating viruses and surface contamination of SARS-CoV-2. In conclusion, we
highlight the effectiveness of UV light-induced virucidal activity of TNPs in controlling
coronavirus spread, which can help create a sanitary environment.
