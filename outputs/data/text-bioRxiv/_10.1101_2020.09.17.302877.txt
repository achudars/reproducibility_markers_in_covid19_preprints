Abstract: Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) belongs to the same beta-coronavirus family as

14

SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV. Studies have shown the requirement of host

15

cellular proteases for priming the surface spike protein during viral entry and transmission in

16

coronaviruses. The metzincin family of metal-dependent endopeptidases called matrix

17

metalloproteinases (MMPs) is involved in virus encephalitis, enhanced blood-brain barrier

18

permeability, or cell-to-cell fusion upon viral infection. Here we show the role of MMPs as

19

mediators of virus-induced host neuroinflammatory response in the MHV model. Infection

20

of mice with wild-type MHV-A59 or its isogenic recombinant strains, RSA59 or RSMHV2

21

significantly upregulated MMP-3, MMP-8, and MMP-14 transcript levels. Functional

22

network assessment with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed a direct involvement of these

23

MMPs in disrupting junctional assembly between endothelial cells via interaction with

24

junctional adhesion molecules and thereby facilitating transmigration of peripheral

25

lymphocytes. Our findings also suggest mRNA upregulation of Park7, which is involved in

26

NADPH oxidase-dependent ROS production, following RSA59 infection. RSA59 infection

27

resulted in elevated mRNA levels of RelA, a subunit of NF-B. Infection with MHV-A59 is

28

known to generate ROS, and oxidative stress can activate NF-B. Thus, our findings indicate

29

the existence of a possible nexus between ROS, NF-B, and MMPs in RSA59-induced

30

neuroinflammation. We also assessed the expression of endogenously produced regulators

31

of MMP activities. Elevated mRNA and protein levels of tissue inhibitors of

32

metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1) in MHV-A59 infection are suggestive of a TIMP-1 mediated

33

host antiviral response.

34

Importance: The newly emergent coronavirus has brought the world to a near standstill.

35

In the past, studies have focused on the function of host proteases in virus attachment and

36

entry. Our research indicates the involvement of a group of metal-dependent host proteases

37

in inflammation associated with coronavirus infection. Inflammation is the first response of

the host to virus infection. While it helps in restricting the spread and clearance of viral

39

particles, uncontrolled inflammation results in several inflammatory consequences.

40

Therefore, it becomes vital to limit unchecked host immune response. The inhibition of

41

specific metalloproteases represents a potential new therapeutic approach in coronavirus

The newly emergent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)

48

(1) and previous encounters with SARS-CoV (2) and middle east respiratory syndrome

49

coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (3) have led to a renewed interest in coronavirus (CoV) research.

50

CoVs are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus [ICTV 9th report, 2011;

51

https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/]. The first step towards infection of a host requires the

52

virus surface spike (S) glycoprotein (180 KDa) to interact with the host cell surface receptor

53

leading to conformational transitions that promote fusion between viral and host cell

54

membranes (4). The CoV S is composed of two subunits, namely N-terminal S1 (consisting

55

of the receptor-binding domain) and C-terminal S2 (comprising the fusion core domain)

56

subunits. Belonging to the class I viral membrane fusion protein family, CoV S requires

57

cleavage at S1/S2 and S2’ (fusion peptide within S2) sites for effective fusion (4, 5). In

58

general, several cellular proteases such as cell surface serine protease, TMPRSS2 (5-8),

59

intracellular endosomal cathepsins (9-14), or extracellular proteases like trypsin (10, 15, 16)

60

and elastases (16-18) have been detected in priming the S protein for fusion.

61

Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) is a member of the same beta-coronavirus genus as SARS-

62

CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV [ICTV 9th report, 2011; https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-

63

reports/]. MHV is a widely studied beta-coronavirus model. Being a natural pathogen of

64

mice, MHV damages the liver and central nervous system (CNS), resulting in hepatitis and

65

meningoencephalitis during acute inflammation. MHV-induced chronic inflammation is

66

associated with demyelination concurrent with axonal loss (19). The cleavage of SARS-CoV-

67

2 spike by intracellular proprotein convertase like furin during virus assembly reduces

68

dependence on extracellular proteases for entry (9). Similarly, few MHV S is also cleaved by

69

furin, and furin inhibition prevents cell-to-cell fusion in MHV-A59 strain (20, 21).

70

Additionally, the role of cellular proteases belonging to the metzincin family called

71

matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) has been shown in CoV infection (21-23). MMPs are a

72

large family of zinc-dependant endopeptidases, of which 23 members are identified in mouse

73

(24). MMPs are best known for their ability to remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM)

74

proteins. Over the years, the substrate repertoire of MMPs has widened to include cytokines,

75

chemokines, growth factors, and hormones (25). By acting upon cytokines or chemokines

76

immobilized on ECM or cell surface, MMPs release soluble effector molecules for a

77

successful inflammatory response and are involved in autoimmune diseases such as multiple

78

sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Alzheimer’s disease (25). Owing to their

79

substrate diversity, MMPs can promote leukocyte migration along the chemotactic gradient

80

by disruption of the blood-brain barrier (25, 26).

81

Recently, using a broad-spectrum metalloprotease inhibitor, it has been shown that in-

82

vitro infection by MHV strains can be inhibited along with the cell-to-cell fusion without

83

affecting S1/S2 cleavage. The effect on infection varied depending on MHV strains and the

84

cell lines used (21).

Endogenously

produced

proteins

called

inhibitors

of

86

metalloproteinases (TIMPs) regulate the proteolytic activity of MMPs (27). So far, identified

87

four TIMP molecules (TIMP-1, -2, -3, and -4) could inhibit all known MMPs. TIMPs bind

88

reversibly to the catalytic subunit of MMPs in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio and inhibit their

89

function.

90

Previous analysis of MMP and TIMP expression in the CNS following infection with

91

neurotropic MHV strain, JHMV showed increased levels of Mmp3, Mmp12, and Timp1

92

mRNAs, which correlated with high virus replication (23). Moreover, TIMP-1 protein

93

expression was found only in CD4+ T-cells and not CD8+ T-cells, suggesting that TIMP-1

94

regulates differential CNS distribution of T-cells. TIMP-1, through its inhibition of protease

95

activity, promotes transient accumulation of CD4+ T cells within the perivascular space and

96

controls the trafficking of T cells into the parenchyma (22). Thus, the dynamic regulation of

97

TIMP and MMP levels is an essential factor determining the onset of inflammation. Overall,

98

infection of mice with MHV serves as a useful model to study acute-inflammatory responses

99

and contributions of the immune system in maintaining homeostasis in the inflamed brain.

100

In this study, we investigated the relationship between the induction of MMP/TIMP

101

expression and inflammation in acute infection of mice with MHV strains. Here we

102

demonstrate that TIMP-1 induction during acute infection following MHV-A59 infection

103

could serve as an antiviral host response to regulate MMP activities. We also determined the

104

role of S protein in inflammation using isogenic recombinant strains RSA59 and RSMHV2

105

that differ only in the spike gene. Our previous studies have shown that these strains induce

106

similar brain inflammation but differ only in their ability to cause demyelination and axonal

107

loss (28, 29). Here we show that RSA59 and RSMHV2 both induce elevated mRNA

108

expression of MMP-3, MMP-8, and MMP-14. Biological network analysis using Ingenuity

109

Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed that MMP-3, MMP-8, and MMP-14 aid immune cell

Additionally, RSA59 infection also induced gene transcription of Park7 during acute

inflammation. Park7 is involved in the NADPH oxidase-dependant ROS pathway. The

114

transcriptomic analysis also suggests the activation of NF-B signaling through elevated

115

levels of RelA. RelA is a subunit of NF-B, and oxidative stress can activate NF-B. Our

study finds a paradigm shift in our understanding of virus-induced inflammatory response by

135

Experiments were performed strictly adhering to the standards of the Committee for the

136

Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA), India.

137

Viruses. A naturally occurring demyelinating strain of MHV, MHV-A59 (Lavi et al.,

138

1984), and two recombinant strains, RSA59 and RSMHV2 (28, 30, 31), were used to infect

139

mice. RSA59 and RSMHV2 are isogenic recombinant strains of MHV-A59 constructed by

140

targeted RNA recombination and differs only in the spike gene as described previously (28,

141

31). The recombinant demyelinating (DM) RSA59 strain expresses the MHV-A59 spike in

142

the background of the MHV-A59 genome. In contrast, the non-demyelinating (NDM)

143

RSMHV2 strain express MHV-2 [wild-type non-demyelinating MHV (32)] spike protein in

144

the MHV-A59 background. Also, the recombinant strains express enhanced green

145

fluorescence protein (EGFP) for easy in-vitro detection of the virus (30).

146

Inoculation of mice. Four-weeks old, MHV-free, male C57BL/6 mice (Jackson

147

Laboratory, USA) were inoculated intracranially with half of 50% lethal dose (LD50) of

148

MHV-A59 (2000 PFU), RSA59 (25,000 PFU) or RSMHV2 (100 PFU) respectively and as

149

described previously (28, 31). Three mice (N=3) per group were kept, and 20 µL of the virus

150

prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 0.075% bovine serum albumin (BSA) was

151

injected into the right cerebral hemisphere of each mouse. Parallelly, we inoculated three

152

mock-infected control mice with only PBS+0.075% BSA. Daily monitoring of mice for

153

disease signs and symptoms was conducted. Control mice were sacrificed between 5-6 days

154

post-infection (p.i). MHV-infected mice were sacrificed at 5-6 (peak of inflammation), 10

155

and 15 days p.i. For RNA studies, brain and spinal cord tissue samples were flash-frozen in

156

liquid N2 and preserved at -80°C until used.

157

Estimation of viral replication. The efficacy of virus replication in mice was assessed

158

by routine plaque assay, as described previously (19, 33, 34) with modifications. Briefly, on

159

day 5-6, 10, and 15 p.i, mice were sacrificed, and brain tissues (either half) harvested

aseptically in 1mL of isotonic saline containing 0.167% gelatin. Tissues were weighed and

161

stored at -80°C for titer assay. Brain tissues from control and infected mice were

162

homogenized, and 250 µL of serially diluted supernatant was added onto confluent

163

monolayers of DBT cells. Following 75 minutes of viral adsorption, culture media containing

164

1.4% agarose was overlaid on the monolayers and incubated for 27 hours (MHV-

165

A59/RSA59) or 36 hours (RSMHV2). Cells were fixed with 4% PFA followed by crystal

166

violet staining. Clear regions indicative of plaques were counted, and values [log10 pfu/gm

167

tissue] plotted against the time of post-infection. Plaque forming unit or PFU was calculated

168

as the number of plaques times dilution factor (DF) per mL per gram of tissue per mL [PFU=

169

(no. of plaques*DF per ml)/ (tissue weight in gram per ml)].

170

Gene expression analysis. Total RNA was extracted from brain tissues of MHV-A59,

171

RSA59 or RSMHV2 infected as well as mock-infected mice using TRIzol reagent

172

(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration was measured

173

using a NanoDrop 2000/2000c Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and cDNA

174

was prepared with 1 µg of total RNA using a cDNA reverse transcription kit. Quantitative

175

real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed using SYBR Green dye-based assay in a

176

QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the following reaction

177

conditions: initial denaturation at 95°C for 7 min, 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 30

178

s, and melting curve analysis at 60°C for 30 s. Reactions were performed in triplicates (n=3).

179

Primer sequences are provided in Table 1. The comparative threshold (ΔΔCT) method was

180

used for relative quantification. The mRNA levels of target genes were normalized with the

181

housekeeping GAPDH gene and represented as the relative fold change values compared to

182

their respective mock-infected controls.

188

Samples were then centrifuged for 15 mins at 13,000 rpm at 4°C to separate the supernatant.

189

The total protein content in the supernatant was estimated with a BCA protein assay kit. For

190

immunoblotting, 60 µg of total protein per sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 12%

191

polyacrylamide gel followed by transfer onto PVDF membranes using transfer buffer (25

192

mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, and 20% methanol). Membranes were blocked for 1 hr at room

193

temperature in 5% v/v goat serum prepared in TBST (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1%

194

v/v Tween 20) and subsequently incubated for overnight at 4°C in polyclonal anti-mouse

195

TIMP-1 antibody at 1:1000 dilution in blocking solution. The membranes were washed in

196

TBST and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with HRP-conjugated donkey anti-goat

197

secondary IgG antibody. As an internal loading control, g-actin was used, and membranes

198

were blocked separately in 5% w/v non-fat skimmed milk in TBST. Polyclonal anti-mouse

199

g-actin antibody (1:5000 dilution) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary IgG

200

antibody (1:10,000 dilution) were used. The blots were washed in TBST, and the

233

Four weeks old, male C57BL/6 mice inoculated with MHV-A59 (2000 PFU) or mock-

234

infected were sacrificed at day 5-6 (acute), 10 (acute-chronic), and 15 (chronic) post-infection

235

(p.i), and brains were harvested. Routine plaque assay was performed with serially diluted

236

brain homogenates to estimate viral replication. MHV-A59 titer was significant between day

237

5-6 p.i (Fig. 1, A; p<0.001) and viral particles were below the detection limit at later time

238

points (data not shown). Total RNA was isolated from mock and virus-infected brain tissues

239

for expression analysis of viral nucleocapsid and Mmp genes through RT-qPCR. Primer

240

sequences are given in Table 1. Levels of viral nucleocapsid mRNA (Fig. 1, B; p<0.0001)

241

coincided with viral replication reaching its peak between day 5-6 p.i, which also marks the

242

acute phase of inflammation. MHV-A59 infected mice exhibited neuroinflammation

243

reaching its peak by 5-7 days p.i, which is associated with meningitis, encephalitis,

244

perivascular cuffing, and macrophage/microglia nodule formation (31). We found similar

245

results in paraffin-embedded brain sections stained by hematoxylin-eosin and

246

immunohistochemistry (data not shown). Transcript levels of Mmp2, Mmp3, Mmp8, and

247

Mmp12 were significantly upregulated at day 5-6 p.i (Fig. 1, C-F; p<0.001) and coincided

248

with the peak in viral replication and acute neuroinflammation. Additionally, Mmp14 mRNA

249

was significantly upregulated only at later time points, between days 10-15 p.i (Fig. 1, G;

250

p<0.001). Collectively, MHV-A59 infection-induced the upregulation of Mmp2, Mmp3,

251

Mmp8, Mmp12, and Mmp14.

3.2. Induction of TIMP-1 expression following MHV-A59 infection

253

Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases or TIMPs are endogenous protein regulators of

254

MMPs. To understand the regulation of MMPs upon MHV-A59 infection, we also

255

considered the gene expression of TIMPs. As described above, total RNA from brain samples

256

of mock and MHV-A59 infected mice were subjected to RT-qPCR using specific primers

infection resulted in significant upregulation of Timp1 mRNA at day 5-6 p.i (Fig. 2, A;

259

p<0.001), while mRNA levels of Timp2, Timp3, and Timp4 remained significantly

260

downregulated (Fig. 2, C-E; p-values varies as <0.05 to <0.0001). While Timp1 mRNA

261

followed a similar expression pattern as the Mmps following MHV-A59 infection-induced

262

inflammation, its protein levels remained high throughout post-infection, as shown in the

263

representative figure (Fig. 2, B). Overall, MHV-A59 resulted in elevated TIMP-1 levels in

264

the brain of infected mice.

265

3.3. Similarities in the induction of MMP and TIMP expression following RSA59 and

266

RSMHV2 infection

267

To determine whether the spike (S) protein has any role in inducing Mmp and Timp

268

expression, we employed isogenic recombinant strains RSA59 and RSMHV2 that differ in

269

their spike protein. In our previous publications (35, 36), using Affymetrix microarray

270

analysis with RNA isolated from spinal cords (day 6 p.i), we have shown that both the

271

recombinant strains induced the upregulation genes related to immune modulation during

272

acute infection. Using the same Affymetrix microarray data, we analyzed Mmp and Timp

273

expression levels in RSA59 and RSMHV2 infection. A threshold of ≥1.5 fold-change with

274

p-values ≤0.05 was considered significant for determining differential gene expression. The

275

analysis revealed that in both strains, there were no significant differences in the expression

276

of Mmp and Timp genes compared with mock samples during the acute infection in the spinal

277

cord. To validate the findings from microarray data, we performed RT-qPCR from brain

278

samples of RSA59, RSMHV2, and mock-infected mice sacrificed at day 5-6, 10, and 15 p.i.

279

Brain samples were also harvested for titer assay to estimate viral replication. Like the

280

parental MHV-A59 strain, viral titer and nucleocapsid mRNA levels peaked by day 5-6 p.i

281

in both the recombinant strains as demonstrated in the representative graphs (Fig. 3, A-C).

282

Although we detected no nucleocapsid mRNAs between 10-15 days p.i in RSMHV2, its

283

presence was observed at day 10 p.i in RSA59 (data not shown). This data corroborates with

284

previous findings that demyelinating RSA59 persists in the brain while RSMHV2 does not

285

persist or, if present, nucleocapsid level is significantly low compared with RSA59 (28).

286

Also, both the strains showed similar kinetics in Mmp gene expression like their parental

287

MHV-A59. Results from RT-qPCR demonstrated significant upregulation of Mmp3, Mmp8,

288

and Mmp14 mRNA levels in both the strains when compared with mock-infection between

289

day 5-6 p.i (Fig. 4, A-F; p-value varies as <0.05 to <0.0001). Additionally, the two strains

290

did not show any difference in altering the levels of Timp1 (Fig. 4, G & H; p<0.0001). Both

291

RSA59 and RSMHV2 do not differ significantly in their ability to induce inflammation in

292

the brain (29, 37). Therefore, we performed biological pathway analysis to understand the

293

involvement of MMP-3, -8, and -14 in the onset of virus-induced neuroinflammation.

299

immune response such as leukocyte extravasation signaling, granulocyte and agranulocyte

300

adhesion and diapedesis (Fig. 5, A). Also, the top disease pathways involved both

301

inflammatory response and immune cell trafficking (Fig. 5, B). Furthermore, IPA revealed

302

that MMPs facilitate the transmigration of firmly adhered granulocytes (Fig. 6, A) and

303

agranulocytes (Fig. 6, B) across the endothelial cells in the blood vessel. Results indicated a

304

relationship between MMPs and junctional proteins like claudin, cadherin, and platelet-

305

derived endothelial cell-adhesion molecule. Collectively, IPA analysis suggests the role of

306

MMP-3, MMP-8, and MMP-14 in peripheral immune cell migration during MHV infection.

307

3.5. RSA59 infection induced increased transcription of oxidative and anti-oxidative

308

pathway genes

309

Brain samples from mice infected with RSA59 and sacrificed at day 5-6 and 10 p.i, were

310

harvested for total RNA isolation followed by cDNA synthesis. Mock-infected samples were

311

kept in parallel. We performed RT-qPCR using primers (Table 1) specific for genes involved

312

in the oxidative and anti-oxidative pathways. Transcript levels of Parkinson's disease 7

313

(Park7) gene were significantly upregulated following RSA59 infection and remained

314

elevated p.i compared to mock-infected samples (Fig. 7, A; p<0.05). RelA, a subunit of NF-

315

B, also showed elevated mRNA levels during the acute infection, i.e., 5-6 days p.i (Fig. 7,

316

B; p<0.0001). On the contrary, mRNA levels of Nfb2, a negative regulatory subunit of NF-

317

B, remained unchanged p.i (Fig. 7, C). Similar to another study of our lab (unpublished

318

data), we detected significantly high mRNA levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor

319

2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox1) genes during the acute disease phase (Fig. 7, D-E;

320

p<0.0001). Overall, RSA59 infection-induced simultaneous transcription of genes such as

321

Park7 and Nfb that are involved in the oxidative pathway as well as anti-oxidative pathway

322

genes like Nrf2 and Hmox1.

323

4. Discussion

324

The current study investigates the regulation of MMPs and their inhibitors during CNS

325

infection with MHV strains. Wild-type MHV-A59 and its isogenic recombinant strains,

326

RSA59 and RSMHV2, were assessed to determine their regulation of MMP and TIMP

327

mRNA expression. Kinetics of MMP and TIMP expression, mostly upregulated during the

328

acute disease phase, was similar in both the parental MHV-A59 and recombinant strains.

329

Here, we show that upregulation of Mmp3, Mmp8, and Mmp14 mRNAs during MHV

330

infection irrespective of differences in the surface spike protein. MMP-3 (stromelysin) is

331

produced by leukocytes and endothelial cells and can act on multiple collagen substrates.

332

Both neutrophils and macrophages produce MMP-8 (neutrophil collagenase), while MMP-

333

14, which is membrane-associated, promotes the conversion of inactive MMP-2 to its active

334

form. Both MMP-8 and MMP-14 can cleave multiple collagen substrates (27). Collectively,

335

the ability of MMP-3, -8, and -14 to modulate the ECM is indicative of their involvement in

336

the migration of peripheral immune cells. These we further confirmed from biological and

337

functional network evaluation using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). IPA analysis

338

suggests a direct role of MMP-3,-8, and -14 in granulocyte and agranulocyte transmigration

339

across the endothelial cells by disrupting claudin, cadherin, or junctional adhesion molecules

340

mediated tight junctional assembly. Moreover, it explains the similarity observed in CNS

341

inflammation with both the recombinant strains RSA59 and RSMHV2 despite having

342

differences in their S proteins. Past studies associating overproduction of MMPs with

343

increased blood-brain-barrier permeability and thereby, enhanced inflammation of

344

neurotropic viruses (38, 39), further supports our observation.

345

In previous studies involving JHMV strains, it has been shown that MMP-3, MMP-12, and

346

TIMP-1 mRNA expression correlates with viral virulence and viral load (23). Additionally,

347

the role of TIMP-1 in inhibiting protease activity and thereby controlling the differential

348

infiltration of T-cell subsets during virus encephalitis was also demonstrated (22). We found

349

Timp1 significantly upregulated in both the strains like the parental MHV-A59. Our study

350

adds further knowledge in understanding the role of TIMP-1. The present work suggests

351

that Timp1 upregulation could be part of a classical host defense mechanism against virus-

352

induced upregulation of different metalloproteases. Whether the downregulation of Timp2,

353

Timp3, and Timp4 is purposely mediated by MHV or there exists a feedback mechanism to

354

maintain a balance among different TIMPs is an exciting aspect to address. Moreover, our

355

study further sheds light into the viral-induced oxidative stress pathway and

356

neuroinflammation.

357

Oxidative stress is an intrinsic mode of tissue damage and also occurs in MHV-A59 infection

358

(40). A NAD-dependent deacetylase, SIRT1 involved in cell stress responses, prevents

359

neuronal injury, decrease oxidative stress, and induce mitochondrial function-associated

360

proteins upon MHV-A59 infection. Oral treatment of MHV-A59 infected mice with a SIRT1

361

activating compound increased expression of mitochondrial enzymes such as succinate

362

dehydrogenase (SDH) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and significantly reduced ROS

363

levels. In our current study, RSA59 infection increased transcript levels of Park7, which is

364

involved in oxidative stress. Park7 has a double-sword effect. In lower ROS concentration,

365

it can affect NADPH oxidase by phosphorylating its p47phox subunit during NADPH oxidase

366

activation, which is crucial for NADPH oxidase-dependant ROS production (41). In one of

367

our studies (unpublished data), we show that Park7 also induces the anti-oxidative pathway

368

via Nrf2 and Hmox1activation during higher cellular ROS concentration.

369

Activation of metalloproteases via oxidative pathways has been demonstrated in the past (42-

370

44). ROS-induced oxidative stress can also activate NF-B signaling (45). The nuclear factor

371

kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) acts as a transcription factor and is

372

known to induce inflammation-related genes. RelA, a subunit of NF-B, which gets activated

373

in the canonical pathway via toll-like receptors that recognize pathogenic patterns (46),

374

showed increased mRNA levels following RSA59 infection. On the other hand, Nfb2,

375

which acts as both a precursor and suppressor of NF-B (46), demonstrated unchanged

376

mRNA levels upon infection. Previously, it has been documented that NF-B can induce

377

MMP genes (47, 48). Therefore, our result indicates that Park7 mediated ROS generation

378

leads to the induction of MMP genes via NF-B signaling during MHV-induced acute

379

disease (Fig. 8).

380

We also found that RSA59 infection-induced upregulation of Nrf2 and Hmox1 genes. The

381

anti-oxidative pathway mediated by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its

382

dependant heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox1) (49), could therefore play an essential role in

383

restoring homeostasis through inhibition of ROS overproduction. One limitation of this study

384

that will be addressed in our future experiments is that the interplay between ROS and MMPs

385

has not been validated using inhibitors of ROS as positive controls.

386

In previous studies (50-52) involving MHV-A59, it has been shown that virus infection

387

reduced expression of connexins (Cxs) that form intercellular gap junctional channels and

388

thereby disrupt functional communications between CNS glial cells and fibroblasts.

389

However, the mechanism through which Cx trafficking is altered is not well understood. The

390

inhibition of MMPs is shown to increase Cx levels in a hypoxia model (47). Our future

391

experiments are directed towards understanding the interaction between MMPs and Cxs to

17

392

explore the underlying mechanism of MHV-induced alteration of gap junctional

393

communication.

394

While the dependence of beta-coronaviruses on cellular proteases for successful entry is

395

widely studied, our findings demonstrate an essential role of cellular proteases in mediating

396

inflammation. Our data suggest that MMP-3, MMP-8, and MMP-14 might play prominent

397

roles in MHV-induced neuroinflammation. Another interesting finding is the existence of a

398

possible nexus between ROS, NF-B, and MMPs during MHV infection. Further studies

399

needed to enhance our understanding of the diverse role played by MMPs in inflammation

400

and in developing strategies to interrupt this process, thereby influencing the outcome of CNS

401

inflammatory diseases. Again, in the human beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes

402

acute respiratory illness, it will be fascinating to explore the role of MMPs or

403

metalloproteases in general.

brain of MHV-A59 infected mice. Brain tissues from mock- and MHV-A59 (2000 PFU)-

565

infected mice at different days post-infection (p.i) were harvested, and viral replication was

566

estimated by routine plaque assay. RNA isolated from brain tissues was subjected to cDNA

synthesis. An equal amount of cDNA template was used for RT-qPCR. Gene expression was

568

normalized to GAPDH and fold-change values obtained using ∆∆Ct method. A: MHV-A59

showed peak viral replication between day 5-6 p.i. No detectable viral particles were

observed at later time points in a routine plaque assay (data not shown). RT-qPCR data

showed significantly elevated mRNA levels of viral nucleocapsid gene in both RSA59 (B)

594

and RSMHV2 (C) at early days p.i, coinciding with peak levels of viral particles as detected

in a plaque assay. Data shown are mean ± SEM from three independent experiments having

Mmps. Data shown are mean ± SEM from three (A-F) and two (G-H) independent

Fig. 5. Analysis of significantly upregulated Mmp genes in RSA59 and RSMHV2

infection compared to mock-infected mice. As shown in Fig. 4, transcript levels of Mmp3,

612

Mmp8, and Mmp14 genes were elevated during the acute stage of infection in both RSA59

613

and RSMHV2 infected mice. These genes were further analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway

614

Analysis (IPA) software and found to be involved in several canonical and disease pathways.

615

A: Among the top canonical pathways, the involvement of Mmp3, Mmp8, and Mmp14

616

genes were observed in granulocyte and agranulocyte adhesion and diapedesis. B:

617

Additionally, other inflammation-related canonical pathways depicted in IPA that involves

618

Mmps are IL-17, IL-8, ILK-signaling, or neuroinflammation signaling. C: Moreover, the role

619

of Mmp3, Mmp8, and Mmp14 in the inflammatory response and immune cell trafficking

620

featured among the top disease pathways upon viral infection. A smaller p-value means that

621

the association between the analyzed genes in MHV infection with the known set of genes

622

implicated in that given pathway is significant and less likely to be random. P-values <0.05

623

are considered statistically significant, and the threshold line represents the p-value is 0.05.

Fig. 6. Network analysis of Mmp3, Mmp8, and Mmp14 in RSA59 and RSMHV2

627

infection. The path designer function of the IPA software was used to dissect further the

628

direct and indirect relationships that exist between these Mmp genes and inflammatory

629

response with a focus on immune cell trafficking. Results demonstrate that Mmps facilitate

630

the transmigration of granulocytes (A) and agranulocytes (B) firmly adhered to endothelial

631

cells in the blood vessel. As observed during granulocyte extravasation (A), MMPs mediate

632

junctional disassembly between endothelial cells via interacting with adhesion molecules

633

such as claudin (CLDN), cadherin 5 (CDH5), endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM1),

634

and junctional adhesion molecules (JAM). Nodes in the network represent the genes (or their

635

corresponding proteins), and the lines connecting the nodes indicate the kind of interaction

636

between the genes (direct is the solid line; indirect is a dotted line). Red dotted rectangles

637

highlight the interaction between MMPs and different molecules.

NF-B. D & E: Moreover, RSA59 infection also induced increased transcription of Nrf2 and

646

Hmox1 genes. Data shown are mean ± SEM from two independent experiments. A

significant difference between multiple groups was compared with ordinary one-way

648

ANOVA, followed by Dunnet’s test. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically

Fig. 8. Graphical abstract depicts the relationship between ROS, NF-B, and induction

651

of MMP genes following RSA59 infection. RSA59 induced the upregulation of Park7

652

(Parkinson's disease 7) in the brain of virus-infected mice compared with mock samples.

653

Park7 is known to activate NADPH oxidase-dependant ROS production. In the downstream

654

of the ROS pathway lies nuclear factor kappa B or NF-B. RSA59 infection also upregulated

655

the transcripts of RelA, a subunit of NF-B. The transcription factor NF-B can induce many

656

inflammation-related genes, including MMPs. Additionally, RSA59 infection increased

657

mRNAs of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its dependant heme

658

oxygenase-1 (Hmox1) genes that are involved in the anti-oxidative pathway. The numbers

659

indicate mRNA fold-change along with its regulation (up or down) as detected in RT-qPCR

in Fig. 7.
