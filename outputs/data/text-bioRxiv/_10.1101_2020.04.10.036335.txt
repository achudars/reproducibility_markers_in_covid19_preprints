ABSTRACT
An outbreak, caused by a RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 named COVID-19 has become pandemic with a
magnitude which is daunting to all public health institutions in the absence of specific antiviral
treatment. Surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein are two important proteins of this
virus facilitating its entry into host cell and genome replication. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a
prospective tool of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway for the control of human viral infections
by suppressing viral gene expression through hybridization and neutralization of target
complementary mRNA. So, in this study, the power of RNA interference technology was harnessed
to develop siRNA molecules against specific target genes namely, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein
gene and surface glycoprotein gene. Conserved sequence from 139 SARS-CoV-2 strains from
around the globe was collected to construct 78 siRNA that can inactivate nucleocapsid
phosphoprotein and surface glycoprotein genes. Finally, based on GC content, free energy of
folding, free energy of binding, melting temperature and efficacy prediction process 8 siRNA
molecules were selected which are proposed to exerts the best action. These predicted siRNAs
should effectively silence the genes of SARS-CoV-2 during siRNA mediated treatment assisting in
the response against SARS-CoV-2
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, Surface glycoprotein, siRNA, siDirect.
1. Introduction
COVID-19, A pandemic affecting lives of billions of people worldwide, has confronted humanity in
the commencement of 2020, is caused by a viral pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or 2019-nCoV. Initial symptoms of this disease mainly include fever,
cough, fatigue, dyspnea & headache[1,2] or it may be asymptomatic[3]. The spike glycoprotein of
SARS-CoV-2 binds directly with the surface cell angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor
present on alveolar epithelial cells of lung facilitating virus entry, replication and triggers cytokine
cascade mechanism[4]. In severe cases, patient may die due to massive alveolar damage and
progressive respiratory failure[1,5]. The current detection process of SARS-CoV-2 carried out by
most countries is using real-time RT-PCR, although several other methods are also being
developed[6–8]. Incubation period for the virus ranges between 2–14 days[9] and in some cases,
transmission is also reported during asymptomatic period[10]. Some recent studies suggest that bats
are likely reservoir hosts for SARS-Cov-2 but the identity of the intermediate host that might have
facilitated transfer to human still remain elusive with some studies indicating pangolins [11].
SARS-CoV-2 is assumed to spread mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets

produced when an infected person sneezes and coughs or between people who are in close
contact[5].
Coronaviruses are genetically classified into four main genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus,
Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus[12]. The first two genera generally infect mammals,
while the last two mostly cause disease in birds. The genome size of coronaviruses ranges between
approximately 26-32 kb and includes about 6 to 11 open reading frames (ORFs)[13]. Nucleocapsid
protein (N), small envelope protein (E), spike surface glycoprotein (S) and matrix protein (M) are
the four major structural proteins of coronavirus and all of which are essential to produce a
structurally complete virus[14,15]. The nucleocapsid protein (N) is a multifunctional protein
comprising three distinct and highly conserved domains: two structural and independently folded
structural regions, namely the N terminal domain and C-terminal domain, which are separated by a
intrinsically disordered RNA-binding domain[16]. The primary role of CoV N protein is to package
the genomic viral genome into flexible, long, helical ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes called
nucleocapsids[17]. Apart from these, N protein is essential for viral assembly, envelope formation,
genomic RNA synthesis, cell cycle regulation and viral pathogenesis[18–20]. Spike glycoprotein
(S) is a viral fusion protein which forms homotrimers protruding from the viral surface[21] and
mediates virus entry to cell[22]. S contains two functional subunits: S1 & S2 subunits. The S1
subunit includes the receptor-binding domain(s) and contributes to stabilization of the membraneanchored S2 subunit that contains the fusion machinery[23]. As the coronavirus S glycoprotein is
surface-exposed and mediates entry into host cells and N nucleocapsid protein are essential for
genome replication, these could be the main targets for designing therapeutics[24].

Silencing of mRNA or post-transcriptional gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) is a
regulatory cellular mechanism. RNAi is a prospective tool for the control of human viral
infections[25–27]. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and micro RNAs (miRNAs) are involved in
the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, where they hybridize to complementary mRNA molecules
and neutralizes mRNA causing suppression of gene expression or translation[28]. Studies show
that, combinations of chemically synthesized siRNA duplexes targeting genomic RNA of SARSCoV results in therapeutic activity of up to 80% inhibition [29]. siRNAs directed against Spike
sequences and the 3 -UTR can inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV.

As of April 10, total infected case is 1,615,059 and among these patients 96,791 people have died
which means case fatality rate (CFR) is approximately 5.99%. The alarming phenomenon is the
exponential
growth
of
total
infection
case
and
death
number
(https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). Treatment of this increased number of people is not
possible as no antiviral drug is still available specifically for SARS-CoV-2 and there is a lack on
appropriate medical response. In silico approaches are a general trend to discover novel therapeutic
approaches [30–33] and for the viruses there is no exception to this [34].Therefore, in this study, we
have designed siRNAs specific to various conserved region of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein &
surface glycoprotein genes of SARS-CoV-2 and finally predicted 8 universal siRNA molecules
against nucleoprotein and glycoprotein genes which will inhibit the translations of these proteins
and allow the host to discard this infection. siRNAs are designed against both nucleoprotein and
glycoprotein as both are important for the survival of virus[22,35] and targeting these proteins may
cause viral inhibition[29,36].
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Sequence retrieval from NCBI
Coding sequences from 139 genomes of Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2)
were
retrieved
from
NCBI
Virus
[37]
portal
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/) (Supplementary Table 1). Nucleocapsid
phosphoprotein and surface glycoprotein sequences were manually extracted and curated from the
retrieved data using bash scripting in linux computer platform.
2.2. Multiple sequence alignment & phylogenetic tree construction
ClustalW [38] algorithm was employed to perform multiple sequence alignment. Maximum
likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed with a bootstrap value of 500. Tamura Nei [39]
model of evolution was selected while constructing the phylogenetic tree. MEGA-X [40] and
MEGA-CC [41] programs were was used for alignment formation, phylogenetic tree construction.
iTOL online tool [42] (https://itol.embl.de/) was used in order to visualize the phylogenetic trees.
2.3. Target recognition & siRNA designing
Target-specific siRNAs were designed with the help of siDirect web server [43]. Rules of Ui-Tei
[44], Amarzguioui [45] and Reynolds [46] were used (Table 1) and the melting temperature was
kept below 21.5 °C as a default parameter for siRNA duplex.
2.4. Off target similarity search using BLAST
Blast search was performed against human genome and transcriptome using the standalone blast
package [47] to identify the possible off target matches. The e-value was set to 1e-10 to reduce the
stringency of the search condition thereby increasing the chances of random matches.
2.5. GC content calculation & secondary structure prediction
OligoCalc [48] was used to calculate the GC content. The secondary structure of siRNAs were
predicted along with the respective free energy using MaxExpect [49] program in the RNA structure
web server [50]. The higher values indicate better candidates as those molecules are less prone to
folding.

2.6. Computation of RNA-RNA interaction through thermodynamics
Higher interaction between the target and the guide strand serves a better predictor for siRNA
efficacy. Therefore, the thermodynamic interaction between the target strand and the siRNA guide
strand was predicted with the aid of DuplexFold [51] program of the RNA structure web server
[50].
2.7. Computation of heat capacity & concentration plot
DINA Melt webserver [52] was used to generate heat capacity and concentration plot. The
ensemble heat capacity (Cp) is plotted as a function of temperature, with the melting temperature
Tm (Cp) (Supplementary Table 6 & Supplementary table 7). The contributions of each species to
the ensemble heat capacity shown by detailed heat capacity plot. Also, the point at which the
concentration of double-stranded molecules of one-half of its maximum value defines the melting
temperature Tm(Conc) was shown using the concentration plot- Tm (Conc).
2.8. Predicted siRNA Validation
siRNAPred server (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/sirnapred/index.html) was used to validate the
predicted siRNA species. The predicted siRNAs were evaluated against the Main21 dataset using
support vector machine algorithm and the binary pattern prediction approach. siRNAPred score
greater than on 1 predicts very high efficacy, score ranging 0.8-0.9 predicts high efficacy and score
ranging 0.7-0.8, predicts moderate efficacy. In total, 78 siRNAs were used for efficacy prediction.
3. Results
3.1. Evolutionary divergence analysis shows conserved pattern between strains
Phylogenetic tree was constructed using 139 sequences for both nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and
surface glycoprotein separately. Only a handful number of sequences showed significant divergence
(bootstrap value > 60%) (Fig 2, Supplementary Table 8). This suggest that most of the viral
sequences have been conserved sequences and therefore used to construct siRNA which will cover a
wide range of SARS-CoV-2 strain.
3.2. siDirect predicted 78 siRNA
siDirect web server predicted 8 siRNA for nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and 70 siRNA for surface
glycoprotein (Supplementary Table 4 & Supplementary table 5) that maintains all the parameters.
Seed target duplex stability (Tm) values for all the predicted siRNAs were less than 21.5 °C which
suggests the ability of predicted siRNAs to avoid non-target binding.
3.3. Off-target binding exclusion using blast
Standalone blast [47] search against human genome and transcriptome did not reveal any off-target
match. This shows that our predicted siRNA would not interact in any other places other than the
viral target location.

3.4. GC content calculation & secondary structure determination
GC content analysis of the predicted siRNAs were ranged 31% to 43% for nucleocapsid
phosphoprotein (Supplementary Table 6) and 10% to 40% for surface glycoprotein (Supplementary
Table 7). Molecules that have GC content below 31.6% were eliminated. Also, the calculated free
energy of folding ranged from 1.4 to 2 for nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (Supplementary Table 6)
and from 1.3 to 2 for surface glycoprotein (Supplementary Table 7). The associated secondary
structures were also determined.

3.5. Thermodynamics of target-guide strand interaction
Free energy of binding between target and guide strand were calculated. The values spanned from
-35.8 to -31 for nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (Supplementary Table 6) and -36.6 to -21.6 for surface
glycoprotein (Supplementary Table 7).
3.6. Heat capacity & duplex concentration plot determination
The Tm(Cp) and Tm(Conc) were calculated for the predicted siRNAs. The higher values of these
two melting temperatures indicate higher effectiveness of the siRNA species. Tm(Conc) values
ranged from 71.7 C to 81.7 C for nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (Supplementary Table 6) and
66.4 C to 83.8 C for surface glycoprotein (Supplementary Table 7). Tm(Cp) values ranged from
72.1 C to 82.5 C for nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (Supplementary Table 6) and from 66.3 C to
85.2 C for surface glycoprotein (Supplementary Table 7).

3.7. Validation and selection of best 8 siRNAs
siRNAPred[53] checked the effectivity of the predicted siRNAs and values greater than 1 are
considered highly effective. 2 siRNAs for nucleaocapsid phosphoprotein and 32 siRNAs for surface
glycoprotein were found to be highly effective. Finally, based on all the other criteria, 8 siRNAs
were selected as best predicted candidates against the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and the surface
glycoprotein genes of SARS CoV-2 (Table 2).
4. Discussion
COVID-19 is an emerging disease that lays bare the society we have created and its interdependent
infrastructure with a surge in cases and deaths since its initial identification. Having no regard for
geography, this pandemic has a global reach, and no continent is out of its clutches. Moreover, there
is no vaccine available to prevent this disease and no RNAi based treatment is yet in practice or
been proposed. So, the next generation medicine, siRNA might be effective in this case, hence it is
the focus of our study.
Here, a total of 34 (15 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and 19 surface glycoprotein) (Supplementary
Table 2 & Supplementary table 3) conserved regions were identified among 139 strains of SARSCoV-2 from around the world. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that a small number sequences form
significant clades with a bootstrap value greater than 60%. (Fig 2, Supplementary Table 8).
Conserved portions that are shorter than 21 nucleotides were omitted from further analysis.
Conserved sequences were put to siDirect web server to identify possible targets and to generate
corresponding siRNAs. siDirect performs the task in three distinct steps – highly functional siRNA
selection, seed-dependent off-target effects reduction, near-perfect matched genes elimination.
siRNA targets were found in 18 conserved regions, 5 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (Supplementary
Table 4) and 13 surface glycoprotein (Supplementary Table 5). U,R,A (Ui-Tei, Amarzguioui and

siRNA’s functionality is influenced by the GC-content and there is an inverse relationship of the
GC-content with the function of siRNA. Usually a low GC content, approximately from 31.6 to
57.9%, is ideal for a siRNA to be effective [54]. Therefore, we calculated the GC content of the
predicted siRNAs. Molecules that have GC content lower than 32% were not kept in the final
selection. Here, GC content ranged from 10% to 43% for all the 78 predicted species. GC content of
finally selected siRNAs are greater than or equal to 33% (Table 2).
Formation of secondary structure of siRNA may inhibit the RISC mediated cleavage of target. So,
the prediction of prospective secondary structure and determination of free energy of corresponding
folding is crucial. Here, guide strands of predicted siRNAs were subjected to RNA structure web
server in order to predict possible folding structures and corresponding minimum free energies. At
37 C, finally selected siRNAs have free energy of folding greater than zero (Fig 3, Table 2), which
suggests the predicted siRNAs are more accessible for efficient binding.
◦

DuplexFold[51] was used to determine the target and guide siRNA interaction and their
corresponding binding energy. Lower binding energy indicate better interaction therefore better
chance of target inhibition. The values of free energy of binding of all the 78 predicted siRNAs
spanned from -36.6 to -21.6 (Supplementary Table 6 & Supplementary table 7). Finally selected
siRNAs have free energy of binding equal or below -30.0 (Fig 4, Table 2), which suggests the
predicted siRNAs are more interactive with their corresponding targets.
The collective heat capacity, denoted as Cp, is plotted as a function of temperature and the melting
temperature, denoted as Tm (Cp), was determined. The contribution of each molecules to the
collective heat capacity was demonstrated using the inclusive heat capacity plot where melting
temperature Tm (Conc), indicates the temperature at which the concentration of double-stranded
molecules of becomes one-half of its maximum value. DINA Melt webserver [52] was used to
obtain the melting temperatures. All the selected siRNAs have high Tm value (>75 C) (Table 2).
◦

Lastly, siRNAPred[53] was used to determine the inhibition efficacy of the predicted siRNAs.
siRNAPred uses Main21 dataset which consist of 2182 siRNAs (21mer) derived from a
homogeneous experimental condition to predict the actual efficacy of 21mer siRNAs with high
accuracy using the support vector machine based method. Here, siRNA candidates that have
validity score greater than one were chosen for the final selection.
In this study, eight prospective siRNA molecules were proposed to be efficient at binding and
cleaving specific mRNA targets of SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2). As the study contain a large array of 139
sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from around the world, the predicted therapeutic agent can be employed
to large scale treatment of COVID-19 pandemic.

5. Conclusions
Computational methods can be employed to design and predict siRNA interaction against specific
gene target thereby silencing its expression. In this research, eight siRNA molecules were predicted
to be effective against nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and surface glycoprotein gene of 139 strains of
SARS-CoV-2 virus using computational method considering all maximum parameters in prime
conditions. In order to decelerate the COVID-19 pandemic and recover the affected individuals the
development of siRNA therapeutic approaches could be a promising alternative to traditional
vaccine designing.

Fig. 1. Graphical representation of the siRNA-mediated gene silencing mechanism. Nanoparticles
es
loaded with siRNA are taken up through endocytosis by the cells. These particles are then trapped
ed
into the endosomes. siRNA escape endosomes and release siRNA into the cytoplasm due to pH
H
responsive mechanism or proton sponge effect. Once generated, siRNA is loaded into RNA-indiced
ed
silencing complex comprising of RNA-binding protein TRBP and Argonaute (AGO2). AGO2 opts
ts
the siRNA guide strand, then excises and ejects the passenger strand. After that, the guide strand
nd
pairs with its complementary target mRNA and AGO2 slices the target. After slicing, the cleaved
ed
target mRNA is released and RISC is recycled for another few rounds of slicing using the samee
guide strand [55].
