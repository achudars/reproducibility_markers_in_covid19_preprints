Abstract
A newly emerging novel coronavirus appeared and rapidly spread worldwide and World
Health Organization declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The roles and
characteristics of coronavirus have captured much attention due to its power of causing
a wide variety of infectious diseases, from mild to severe on humans. The detection of
the lethality of human coronavirus is key to estimate the viral toxicity and provide
perspective for treatment. We developed alignment-free machine learning approaches for
an ultra-fast and highly accurate prediction of the lethality of potential human-adapted
coronavirus using genomic nucleotide. We performed extensive experiments through six
different feature transformation and machine learning algorithms in combination with
digital signal processing to infer the lethality of possible future novel coronaviruses
using previous existing strains. The results tested on SARS-CoV, MERS-Cov and
SARS-CoV-2 datasets show an average 96.7% prediction accuracy. We also provide
preliminary analysis validating the effectiveness of our models through other human
coronaviruses. Our study achieves high levels of prediction performance based on raw
RNA sequences alone without genome annotations and specialized biological knowledge.
The results demonstrate that, for any novel human coronavirus strains, this
alignment-free machine learning-based approach can offer a reliable real-time estimation
for its viral lethality.

Coronaviruses are positive, single-stranded RNA virus and have been identified in
humans and animals. They are categorized into four genera: α, β, γ and θ [1]. Previous
phylogenetic analysis revealed a complex evolutionary history of coronavirus, suggesting
ancient origins and crossover events that can lead to cross-species infections [2] [3]. Bats
and birds are a natural reservoir for coronavirus gene pool [4]. The mutation and
recombination play critical roles that enable cross-species transmission into other
mammals and humans [5]. Human coronavirus (HCoV) was first identified in the
mid-1960s [6], and up to now, seven types of coronavirus can infect people. Four of
them, i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, usually cause
mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illness like common cold when infecting

humans [7]. The other three members include severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(MERS-CoV) and the most lately severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19 coronavirus. They all belong to
Betacoronavirus that led to the epidemics or pandemics [8] [9] [10].
Emerging in November 2002 in Guangdong province, China, SARS caused 8,096
human infections with 774 deaths by July 2003 [11]. MERS was first reported in Saudi
Arabia in September 2012 and finally resulted in 2,494 human infections by November
2019 [12]. Recently, a novel coronavirus named COVID-19 is emerging and spreading to
215 countries or territories on June 12, 2020, leading to 7,390,702 confirmed cases with
417,731 deaths according to the World Health Organization [13]. Though precautions
such as lockdown of cities and social distance have been taken to curb the transmission
of COVID-19, it spreads far more quickly than the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
diseases [4] [14]. To make matters worse, the number of infected cases still increases
rapidly and the global inflection point about COVID-19 is unknown. Like other RNA
viruses, e.g. influenza virus [15], coronaviruses possess high mutation and gene
recombination rates [16], which makes constant evolution of this virus with the
emergence of new variants. From SARS in 2002 to COVID-19 in 2019, coronaviruses
have caused high morbidity and mortality, and unfortunately, the fast and untraceable
virus mutations take the lives of people before the immune system can produce the
inhibitory antibody [17]. Currently, no miracle drug or vaccines are available to treat or
prevent the humans infected by coronaviruses [18] [19]. Therefore, there is a desperate
need for developing approaches to detect the lethality of coronaviruses not only for
COVID-19 but also the potential new variants and species. This would facilitate the
diagnosis of coronavirus clinical severity and provide decision-making support.
The detection of viral lethality has already been explored in influenza viruses [20].
Through a meta-analysis of predicting the virulence and antigenicity of influenza
viruses, we can infer the lethality of the virus timely to improve the current influenza
surveillance system [21]. Regarding the risk of novel emerging coronavirus strains, much
attention has been captured to investigate the lethality or clinical severity of new
emerging coronavirus. Typically, epidemiological models are certainly built to estimate
the lethality and the extent of undetected infections associated with the new
coronaviruses. Bastolla suggested an orthogonal approach based on a minimum number
of parameters robustly fitted from the cumulative data easily accessible for all countries
at the John Hopkins University database to extrapolate the death rate [22].
Bello-Chavolla et al. proposed a clinical score to evaluate the risk for complications and
lethality attributable to COVID-19 regarding the effect of obesity and diabetes in
Mexico [23]. The results provided a tool for quick determination of susceptibility
patients in a first contact scenario. Want et al. leveraged patient data in real-time and
devise a patient information based algorithm to estimate and predict the death rate
caused by COVID-19 for the near future [24]. Aiewsakun et al. performed a
genome-wide association study on the genomes of COVID-19 to identify genetic
variations that might be associated with the COVID-19 severity [25]. Moreover, Jiang et
al. established an artificial intelligence framework for data-driven prediction of
coronavirus clinical severity [26]. The development of computational and physics-based
approaches has relieved the labors of experiments by utilizing epidemiological and
biological data to construct the model. However, direct evaluation of potential novel
coronavirus strains for their lethality is crucial when clinicians are forced to make
difficult decisions without past specific experience to guide clinical acumen. Inferring
the lethality of novel coronavirus is possible by identifying the patterns from a large
number of coronavirus sequences.
In this paper, we propose alignment-free machine learning-based approaches to infer

the lethality of potential novel human-adapted coronavirus using genomic sequences.
The main contribution is that we formulate the problem of estimating the lethality of
human-adapted coronavirus through machine learning approaches. By leveraging some
appropriate feature transformation, we can encode genomic nucleotides into numbers
that allow us to convert it into a prediction task. The experimental results suggest our
models deliver accurate prediction of lethality without prior biological knowledge. We
also performed phylogenetic analysis validating the effectiveness of our models through
other human coronaviruses.

Problem formulation

The pandemic of novel coronavirus COVID-19 has caused thousands of fatalities,
making tremendous treats to public health worldwide. The society is deeply concerned
about its spread and evolution with the emergence of any potential new variants, that
would increase the lethality. Typically, lethality refers to the capability of causing death.
It is usually estimated as the cumulative number of deaths divided by the total number
of confirmed cases. Among all the human-adapted coronaviruses, MERS-CoV caused
the highest fatality rate of 37% [12], followed by the SARS-CoV with 9.3% fatality
rate [27]. In comparison, COVID-19 indicates a lower mortality rate of 5.5% [13]. The
lethality rate of COVID-19 is likely to decrease with better treatment and precautions.
In this paper, we mainly focus on these three types of human-adapted coronavirus and
define the degree of viral lethality in terms of historical fatality rates. As a result,
MERS-CoV strains are high lethal while SARS-CoV and COVID-19 strains are middle
and low lethal, respectively.

Genomic nucleotide sequences of three different coronaviruses with the human host are
downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology Information on April 30, 2020 [28].
Duplicate sequences and incomplete genomes with a length smaller than 20000 are
removed from the collection to address the possible issues raised from sequence length
bias. Some SARS-CoV strains from the laboratory are included that are cultivated in
Vero cell cultures to enrich the training samples. Finally, we end up with 321, 351, 1638
samples for MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we also collect the
genomic data of other four human coronaviruses with 27, 64, 32 and 142 strains for
HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, respectively. Apart from the
four symbolic bases (A, C, T, G) of each strain, we have degenerate base symbols that
are an IUPAC representation [29] for a position on genomic sequences, which could
denote multiple possible alternatives. These degenerate base symbols contain W (A, T),
S (C, G), M (A, C), K (G, T), R (A, G), Y (C, T), B (C, G, T), D (A, G, T), H (A, C,
T), V (A, C, G), N(A, C, T, G), where the letters in the bracket are alternative
nucleotide representing degenerate bases. We randomly substitute these degenerate
bases so that genomic sequences can be mapped into discrete numerical representation
through feature transformation.

important as the existing machine learning approaches can only deal with vectors but
not sequence samples. Several methods are proposed that convert genomic sequences
into numerical vectors, e.g., the fixed mapping between nucleotides and real numbers
without biological significance [32], based on physio-chemical properties [33], deduction
from doublets or codons [34], and chaos game representation [35]. To accommodate
comprehensive analysis and comparison, we adapt different types of numerical
representations for biological RNA sequences. Randhawa et al. [36] showed that ”Real”,
”Just-A” and ”Purine/Pyrimidine (PP)” numerical representation yield better
performance over other methods for DNA classification, which are included for
analyzing genomic data. The electro-ion interaction potential (EIIP) and
nearest-neighbor based doublet are incorporated that are based on physio-chemical
properties and nearest-neighbor values respectively. Apart from the aforementioned
one-dimensional representation, we have introduced 2D Chaos Game Representation
(CGR) into feature transformation of original sequences.
The real number representation is a fixed transformation technique that we obtain
values of four bases as: adenine (A) = -1.5, thymine (T) = 1.5, cytosine (C) = 0.5, and
guanine (G) = -0.5 [37]. It is efficient in finding a complementary strand of DNA/RNA
sequence and can endure complementary property. Just-A” method maps the four bases
into binary classification as the presence of adenine is labeled 1, while others are 0 [38].
PP representation is a DNA-Walk model that shows nucleotides sequences in which a
step is taken upwards if the nucleotide is pyrimidine with T/C = 1, or downward if it is
purine with A/G = -1 [39]. EIIP describes the distribution of the energy of free
elections along with nucleotide sequences that a single EIIP indicator sequence is
formed through replacing its nucleotides, where A=0.1260, C=0.1340, G=0.0806, and
T=0.1335 [40]. The sequence-to-signal mapping for nearest-neighbor based doublet
representation is illustrated in [34], where the last position is followed by the first in the
sequence. Lastly, CGR is a method proposed by Jeffrey [41] that has been successfully
used for a visual representation of genome sequence patterns and taxonomic
classification [42] [43]. The CGR images of RNA/DNA sequences are drawn in a unit
square. The four vertices of the square are labeled by four nucleotides. The first
nucleotide of the sequence is plotted halfway between the center of the square and the
vertex representing this nucleotide. The next base is mapped into the image that the
coordinate is assigned halfway between the previous point and the vertex corresponding
to the previous nucleotide. The mathematical formulation of the successive points that
calculates the coordinates in the CGR of the sequences is described below:
Xi = 0.5 ∗ (Xi−1 + Cix )
Yi = 0.5 ∗ (Yi−1 + Ciy )

Machine learning has been utilized in many aspects of viral genomic analysis, e.g.,
antigenicity prediction of viruses [21], genome classification of novel pathogens [43],
reassortment detection [44], receptor binding analysis [45] and vaccine
recommendation [46], etc. With increasingly available genomic sequences, it will play
more critical roles in helping biologists to analyze large, complex biological data for
prediction and discovery. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the
lethality inference of potential human-adapted coronaviruses via alignment-free machine
learning approaches. The proposed methods not only contain traditional machine
learning models but also deep learning techniques in combination with Discrete Fourier

Transform for genome analysis. Six different types of numerical representations are
implemented in comparison with the predictive performance of machine learning models.
Traditional machine learning models consist of logistic regression (LR), random forest
(RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and neural network (NN) [47], while three variants of
convolutional neural network (CNN) and two types of recurrent neural network (RNN)
are leveraged. The CNN models contain AlexNet [48], VGG [49] and ResNet [50].
Following the choices of five one-dimensional numerical representation for viral
sequences, digital signal processing is introduced through DFT techniques. We assume
that the number of input sequence is n and all the sequences have the same length l. For
each sequence Si = (Si (0), Si (2), ..., Si (l − 1)), where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, Si (k) ∈ {A, C, T, G}
and 0 ≤ k ≤ l − 1, the corresponding discrete numerical representation is formulated as
Ni = (f (Si (0)), f (Si (2)), ..., f (Si (l − 1)))

where f (Si (k)) denotes the numerical value after mapping by function f (·) at the
position k of nucleotide sequence Si . The signal Ni computed after DFT is represented
as vector Fi . The formulation of Fi is presented below. We define that the magnitude
vector that corresponds to the signal Ni as Mi , where Mi is the absolute value of Fi .
Fi (k) =

Typically, the length of numerical digital signal Ni is equal to the magnitude spectrum
Mi that is originated from the length of the genomic sequence. However, the input
genome sequences are in different lengths, thus they need to be length-normalized after
DFT. Median length-normalization is leveraged for the input digital signals using zero
padding. We employ anti-symmetric padding that begins from the last position if the
input sequences are shorter than the median length, these short signals are extended to
the median length with zero-padding, while the longer sequences are truncated after the
median length.
As for the two-dimensional numerical representation, i.e., CGR, a point that
corresponds to a sequence of length l will be contained within a square with a side of
length 2−l . We assume a square CGR image is generated with a size of 2k ×2k matrix,
where k is the parameter that determines the size of the image. The frequency of
occurrence of any oligomer in a sequence can be obtained by partitioning the CGR
space into small squares. Therefore, the number of CGR points in each unit square of
2k ×2k grid is equal to the number of occurrences of all possible k-mers in the sequence.
By counting the frequency of CGR points, it is possible to calculate oligonucleotide
frequencies at various grid resolutions. We define the element aj as the number of
points that are located in the corresponding sub-square j, where 1 ≤ j ≤ 22k . Each
sequence will be mapped into a 2k ×2k dimensional vector space based on CGR.

We implement all the models by Scikit-learn [51] and PyTorch [52]. We utilize the
retrospective way to train and test the model since the isolation time of viral strains are
available. For each type of coronavirus, the samples generated from strains isolated
before the year N are used to build the model, while those generated after the year N
are for testing. The year N is determined based on the condition that divides training
and testing set in a rough 0.8:0.2 ratio. The 5-fold cross-validation is performed in the
training process and the independent testing set is used for validation of our models.
This test can truly reflect the ability of the models in applications to predict viral
lethality for future strains. The parameters are set by default with traditional machine

with a minimum batch size of 64 for optimization. The drop-out (rate = 0.9) strategy is
carried out with a 0.001 learning rate and all the models are fit for 50 training epochs.
The predictive performance is evaluated by accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and F1 score
of all models in the prediction tasks of coronavirus lethality.

We first analyzed the composition of the RNA genome of the three human-adapted
coronaviruses. Fig 1 portrays the average distribution and variance of the nucleotides.
We can observe that the proportion of A and T (in replacement of U) is high, while C
and G are relatively low for all human coronaviruses. Interestingly, it is suggested that
the high T and low C proportions of human coronaviruses are quite variable and act like
communicating vessels. T goes up when C decreases and vice versa. The composition of
T ranges from 0.139 to 0.552 while C makes the opposite movement from 0.374 to 0.107
respectively among all human coronavirus. If we look into individual types, the
SARS-CoV-2 as a novel human pathogen follows some typical composition of
nucleotides but it is also characterized by some differences. We find that SARS-CoV-2
presents a higher variance compared with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. This is probably
the rapid and widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 accelerates its evolution when
infected with humans. More strains are generated differently from their ancestor clade.
However, it is more pronounced of the nucleotide bias in the unpaired regions of the
structured RNA genome, which may indicate a certain biological function of these

special sequence signatures. Some studies have revealed that a clear difference in the
magnitude of the nucleotide bias of the coronavirus genomes is likely to relate to the
mechanism of subgenomic mRNA synthesis and the exposure of single-stranded RNA
domains [53] [54]. The evidence shows that cytosine discrimination and deamination
against CpG dinucleotides are the driving force that outlines the coronaviruses over
evolutionary times [55]. It is indicated that the atypical nucleotide bias could reflect
distinct biological functions that are the direct cause of the characteristic codon usage
in these viruses [56]. Therefore, the analysis of the nucleotide and codon usage in
coronaviruses can not only exhibits the clues on potential viral evolution but also
improves the understanding of the viral regulation and promotes vaccine design.

Studies have investigated the role of k-mer frequency for fast and accurate classification
of viral genomes [57]. We experiment values for k-mer of length k=1, 2, ... , 7 on
different classifiers to measure the prediction accuracy. To explore the k-mer frequency
patterns in distinct coronaviruses, we curate independent testing set to assess the
performance. Fig 2 shows the predictive accuracy across seven machine learning
algorithms, at different values of k. Fig 2 portrays the performance curves by deep
learning models (in the left), and the results via traditional machine learning models (in
the right). Overall, our proposed methods obtain an average accuracy of 0.956. However,
we can observe the traditional machine learning methods exceed 0.98 in accuracy at all
k values, whereas there is a different story for deep learning models. It is shown that
VGG-19 achieves the best results, while the accuracy could be as low as 0.8 using
ResNet-34 when k = 2. We can conclude that for these data the traditional machine
learning methods outperform deep learning models almost at all levels of k with less

We analyzed the effect on viral lethality prediction via different numerical
representations for RNA sequences using machine learning approaches. The dataset
used is the same as those in Fig 2. The results along with the average scores for all
numerical representations and classifiers are summarized in Table 1. As can be observed
from Table 1, for all numerical representations, the average scores are high over all
measures. The best performance is achieved when using CGR representation, which
yields an average accuracy of 0.985 in the testing set. Surprisingly, we can obtain an
average accuracy of 0.967 even with a single nucleotide numerical representation
”Just-A”. At the individual classifier level, traditional machine learning methods display
an apparent advantage over deep learning models. Logistic regression and neural
network can achieve 100% accuracy for all numerical representations, whereas the
prediction accuracy ranges from 0.679 to 0.993 implemented by Resnet34, VGG19 and
AlexNet. At this point, this is probably because deep learning algorithms need a large
amount of data to understand the pattern. In addition to performing higher accuracy,
machine learning models are computationally cheaper in this task, e.g. in CGR
representation, it takes much longer time for deep learning models (ResNet:4min41s,
AlexNet:1min21s, VGG:55s) than classical machine learning methods on average
(KNN:1min56s, NN:1min30s, LR:1min7s, RF:12s). Overall, our results suggest that all
these numerical representations are effective for modeling to differentiate the degree of
the lethality of human coronavirus.

We test the ability of our models to identify the lethality of other different human
coronaviruses, i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1. The
training process is implemented on the former three types of coronavirus data. For
every test dataset, we use CGR as the numerical representation with all classifiers to
predict the lethality. Interestingly, the results show that, on average, 28 out of 32
HCoV-229E, 59 out of 64 HCoV-NL63, 134 out of 142 HCoV-OC43 and 25 out of 27
HCoV-HKU1 strains identified have closer lethality with SARS-CoV-2, while the rest
strains are labeled middle or high. This suggests that, overall, other test human
coronaviruses have lower severity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Evidence has
revealed that HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are associated with mild to moderate
upper respiratory tract illness with about 0.1% fatality [58]. These infections may be
asymptomatic and are considered the second common cause of cold [59]. Similarly, it
has been well documented that the majority of HCoV-NL63 infections are mild in
humans, though occasionally this coronavirus causes pneumonia or central nervous
system diseases in susceptible individuals [60]. During 2009 and 2016, it accounted for
about 0.5% of all acute respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients from
Guangzhou, China, but few death cases are reported [61]. HCoV-229E is a close relative
of HCoV-NL63 and it will lead to alike symptoms [62].
Figure 3 displays the CGR plots of different sequences of human coronavirus at the
value of 6 for k-mer frequency. The CGR plots visually indicate that the genomic
signature of the SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (Fig.3c) is closer to the genomic
signature of the SARS-CoV coronavirus isolate Canada (Fig.3a), followed by the strain
of MERS-CoV Betacoronavirus England 1 isolate (Fig.3b). Moreover, the other four
human coronaviruses from Fig.3d (HCoV-OC43/JN129835.1), Fig.3e

(HCoV-NL63/JQ765575.1) presents similar visual patterns, which are different from the
former three types. Given the CGR plots of human coronaviruses, we further explore
the trace of their origin and relation through phylogenetic analysis. We randomly select
five complete genomes from each type containing the reference strain. The phylogenetic
tree is constructed based on all pairwise distance with maximum likelihood technique
for the dataset. The results in Fig. 4 presents a clear separation of seven clusters and
relationships within the clusters. The average inter-cluster distances confirm that
SARS-CoV-2 sequences are closest to the species of SARS-CoV (average distance 0.486),
followed by MERS-CoV (4.782), which are far away from other four human
coronaviruses. We also find that HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E and
HCoV-NL63 may originate from the same ancestor with the genetic distance 1.842 and
2.779, respectively. But there is no evidence indicating the situation that the two
different species of human coronavirus will present similar lethality if they are
genetically close.

We provided a comprehensive quantitative analysis to predict the lethality of potential

sequence alignment is not needed with the leverage of DFT techniques. The experiment
results show that most of the models have achieved rapid and accurate predictions for
the lethality of new human-adapted coronavirus. We validated our results by a
quantitative analysis based on the construction of the phylogenetic tree, which reveals
the evolutionary relationships among all human coronaviruses based upon genetic
information. Coronaviruses are usually thought to cause mild and non-lethal symptoms
in humans before the outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003. The high pathogenicity of
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly SARS-CoV-2 captures surgent interests and
concerns of the family of coronavirus. Timely analysis of genomic sequences of novel
strains requires quick sequence similarity comparison with thousands of known species,
which are generally performed by alignment-based methods. However, these methods
are time-consuming and sometimes challenging in cases where homologous sequence
continuity cannot be ensured. The application of alignment-free approaches has
addressed this issue that can handle a large number of sequences effectively.
Previous studies have elucidated that the origin of this SARS-CoV-2 stems from
bats [10] [63]. Early sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 strains revealed over 99% similarity
with some bat-like coronavirus, indicating these infections result from a recent
cross-species event [64]. Bats are regarded as the natural reservoir of viruses and
cross-species transmission to mammals [4] [65]. Before the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, it
is uncovered that the coronavirus SARS-Cov and MERS-CoV have also originated from
bats [66] [67]. The phylogenetic analyses assist to identify the relationships between
SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses through nucleotide and amino acid sequence
similarities. The continuous human-to-human transmission has been confirmed and
asymptomatic cases have continued to increase [68] [69]. There is a desperate need for
strict precautions to prevent the spread of the virus and protect public health. Vaccines
and miracle drugs are the most efficient ways of fighting against this crisis. Currently,
the development of vaccines has been into Phase 3 trials in some countries, while the
human ACE2 receptor has been identified as the potential receptor for COVID-19 and
serves as a potential target for treatment [70] [71]. Nevertheless, with the circulation of
bat-related coronavirus and geographic coverage, it is critical to monitor the evolution
of coronavirus. Currently, seven known types of coronavirus can infect humans. Novel
strains of these coronaviruses can likely arise and attack human again through
reassortment and mutation when two different or more strains co-infect the same host.
Preparation is necessary to prevent potential epidemics and pandemics caused by a
novel coronavirus. As a result, our work paves the basis for surveillance by inferring the
lethality of any potential human coronaviruses that may emerge in the future.
This study is subject to a variety of limitations. The definition of classifying the
degree of coronavirus lethality is mainly based on the mortality rate. We assume that
the higher the mortality, the more lethal for the virus, and thus make three categories of
the lethality level for all viruses with a different threshold. However, our estimation for
these values lies within the range of fatality rate from the literature, which we do not
have sufficient data to parameterize the case-structured model, especially for viruses
with few samples. We also do not build a benchmark for the death caused directly by
human coronaviruses, as the criteria from institutions and countries could be different.
Besides, the limited data points for the human coronavirus pale the high predictive
accuracy, as most of the machine learning algorithms possess a superb generation ability
to discover inherent patterns from training samples, particularly in the small dataset.
But like typical machine learning approaches, our models are not qualified to provide a
direct and accessible explanation that explicitly interprets why a certain coronavirus
strain is more lethal to humans. Some rule-based methods or clinical study might
provide a better rationale for their results.

Conclusion

384

We provide a comprehensive analysis through alignment-free machine learning-based
methods for the prediction of the lethality of potential human-adapted coronavirus. The
results show that on the average, CGR, EIIP, and Just-A representations perform better
than others. Interestingly, traditional machine learning methods display obvious merit
both in computational efficiency and performance than deep learning models on this
task. Validation of other types of human coronavirus in combination with phylogenetic
analysis further demonstrates our predictive results. We hope this work would facilitate
the research of COVID-19 for biologists and clinicians that are in the frontline.
