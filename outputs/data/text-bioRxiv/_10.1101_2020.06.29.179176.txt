ABSTRACT

23

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created an urgent need for large amounts of diagnostic tests to

24

detect viral RNA, which commercial suppliers are increasingly unable to deliver. In addition to the

25

lack of availability, the current methods do not always fully inactivate the virus. Together, this calls

26

for the development of safer methods for extraction and detection of viral RNA from patient

27

samples that utilise readily available reagents and equipment present in most standard laboratories.

28

We present a rapid and straightforward RNA extraction protocol for inactivating the SARS-CoV-

29

2 virus that uses standard lab reagents. This protocol expands analysis capacity as the inactivated

30

samples can be used in RT-qPCR detection tests at laboratories not otherwise classified for viral

31

work. The method circumvents the need for commercial RNA purification kits, takes about 30

32

minutes from swab to PCR-ready viral RNA, and enables downstream detection of SARS-CoV-2

33

by RT-qPCR with very high sensitivity (~4 viral RNA copies per RT-qPCR). In summary, we

34

present a rapid, safe and sensitive method for high-throughput detection of SARS-CoV-2, that can

35

be conducted in any laboratory equipped with a qPCR machine.

INTRODUCTION

39

In mid-December 2019, reports emerged that patients in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, were

40

suffering from atypical pneumonia, and by start-January, the causative agent, severe acute

41

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified (1, 2). The disease was named

42

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The initial epicentre of virus spread seems to have been

43

the Huanan seafood wholesale market in Wuhan. Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome is very

44

similar to bat SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses (~96%), it carries unique sequence motifs in the

45

receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein that binds to the human angiotensin-

46

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (3). These differences suggest that natural selection in an

47

intermediate host species optimised binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, and facilitated transmission

48

to, and spread between, humans. By mid-January 2020, the virus was found in Thailand and Japan

49

following which it spread worldwide (4, 5). As of June 2020, the US had the largest number of

50

identified SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, but also several European countries, e.g., Italy, Spain,

51

United Kingdom, and France have large numbers of COVID-19 patients (6). As of today, cases of

52

COVID-19 are rapidly increasing in India, Mexico and parts of Africa and South America.

53
54

The possibility to rapidly test large numbers of individuals for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 is a

55

vital component in containing viral spread, in understanding the infectious fatality rate, and in

56

subsequently guiding the controlled reopening of our societies. In medical laboratories, the

57

presence of SARS-CoV-2 is commonly detected in a two-step process, where each step requires

58

different kits. Step one is the RNA extraction from patient swabs usually performed using a kit

59

from Qiagen or Roche (7), and step two is the detection of SARS-CoV-2, often achieved by a

60

reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). With the rapidly growing

61

need for SARS-CoV-2 tests, commercial supplies are increasingly falling short on kits for both

62

steps, thereby creating a need for alternative methods that utilise readily available reagents and

63

equipment present in most standard laboratories.

64
65

A method, which combines a high molar acidic guanidinium isothiocyanate (GITC) solution,

66

phenol and chloroform (collectively termed GPC), is broadly used to extract intact RNA from

67

diverse biological samples (8, 9). The standard protocol for RNA-extraction by GCP is lengthy and

68

requires significant expertise in handling RNA, making it unsuitable for large-scale screening

69

programs. Here, we present a much-simplified version of the GPC-extraction method that

70

overcomes these limitations while still providing inactivated, viral RNA that is compatible with

71

downstream RT-qPCR detection. The method enables detection of ~4 viral RNA copies per RT-

72

qPCR, corresponding to ~104 viral RNA copies on the swab. This detection limit is substantially

73

lower than the average virus load per nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) swab from

74

symptoms onset to day five (6.76x105 copies per swab) and later during the disease course

75

(3.44x105) (10, 11). In addition to the protocol simplification, this modified method further offers

76

safe working conditions for healthcare personnel as the GPC solution is known to rapidly and fully

77

inactivate viruses of the corona family, e.g., MERS-CoV (12). The efficient viral inactivation

78

enables the simplified GCP-extraction method to be used at laboratories not classified for viral

79

work, when on-site capacity at authorised hospital laboratories presents an issue, thereby expanding

80

testing capacity.

81
82

In summary, we propose a rapid, safe and sensitive method for high-throughput detection of SARS-

83

CoV-2, that can be conducted in any laboratory equipped with an RT-qPCR machine, using

84

inexpensive and readily available reagents.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

87

Protocol outline

88

The method comprises the following four steps.

89

1. Patient sampling by NP or OP swabs.

90

2. Addition of the GPC reagents that instantly inactivates the virus and protects the released

91

viral RNA genome from enzymatic degradation.

92

3. Extraction of RNA in 2 simple steps.

93

4. RT-qPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the patient sample.

94
95

Sample preparation and RNA extraction using the simplified GPC-extraction method

96

We obtained OP and NP samples from one hospitalised COVID-19 patient who had tested virus-

97

positive three weeks earlier (cobas® SARS-CoV-2 test, Roche diagnostics), from three individuals

98

who had previously tested SARS-CoV-2 positive, but tested negative on the day of sampling

99

(cobas® SARS-CoV-2 test, Roche diagnostics), and from a healthy individual. NP and OP swabs

100

were collected using FLOQSwabs® (COPAN, 552C), placed in transport tubes, sealed and

101

transferred to the laboratory. Each swab was incubated for 5 min at room temperature in an

102

Eppendorf tube containing 1.1 mL TRI-reagent (T9424, Sigma), after which the swab was

103

discarded, and 200 µL of chloroform was added. This sample/GPC mixture was vortexed for 30

104

sec, incubated for 3 min at room temperature, centrifuged for 15 min 12.000 g at 4°C, after which

105

10 µL of the upper aqueous phase was carefully transferred to a new tube without disturbing the

106

interphase. The 10 µL sample was diluted with RNase-free water as detailed below.

109

To test the effect of GITC on the quality of both one-step and two-step RT-qPCR reactions, we

110

created dilution series of the OP and NP samples that allowed the final dilution in the subsequent

111

RT-reaction of the RT-qPCR to range from 8x to 100x (Figure 1). For example, to achieve a 100x

112

final dilution in the RT-reaction of a 25 µL one-step RT-qPCR, the 10 µL sample was mixed with

113

190 µL RNase-free water to a dilution of 20x, followed by 5 µL of this sample mixed in a 25 µL

114

one-step RT-qPCR to a final dilution of 100x.

115
116

Two-step RT-qPCR against human B2M mRNA

117

The effect of GITC on RT-qPCR components was examined by amplifying beta-2-microglobulin

118

(B2M) mRNA (13) in the dilution series of extracted RNA from OP and NP samples from a healthy

119

individual, in an RT-qPCR run in two separate steps. The reverse transcription reaction (20 µL)

120

contained 2 µL 10x M-MulV buffer (B0253S, New England Biolabs), 1 µL of 50 µM Oligo 18 dT

121

(SO132, Thermo Fisher), 1 µL of 50 ng/µL random hexamers (18091050, Invitrogen), 1 µL of 10

122

mM of deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTPs) (180912050, Invitrogen), 0.2 µL of 40 U/µL RNase

123

inhibitor (3335402001, Roche), 5 µL of the RNA extraction sample (diluted from 2x to 25x), 8.8

124

µL RNase-free H2O, and 1 µL of 200 U M-MuLV reverse transcriptase enzyme (B0253S, New

125

England Biolabs). Negative controls were reactions without the RT enzyme and without sample,

126

and the positive control was RNA isolated from HeLa cells. The RT-reaction was performed in

127

VeritiTM 96-Well Thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) (5 min at 25C, 1 h at 42C, and 20 min at

128

65C). The qPCR reaction (10 µL) contained 0.5 µL of the 10 µM B2M forward primer (5’-TGC

129

CTG CCG TGT GAA CCA TGT-3’), 0.5 µL of the 10 µM B2M reverse primer (5’-TGC GGC

130

ATC TTC AAA CCT CCA TGA-3’), 1 µL of the RT-reaction, 3 µL RNase-free H2O, 5 µL

131

PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix (A25741, Thermo Fisher). Reactions were set up in a 384-well

133

(2 min at 50C, 2 min at 95C, followed by 40 cycles of 95C for 15 sec; 60C for 1 min). Finally, a

134

melting curve was recorded for 15 sec. at 95°C, 1 min at 60°C and 15 sec at 95°C. Data were

135

analysed using QuantStudioTM 12K Flex Software. To confirm that only mRNA was amplified, the

136

reactions were analysed by gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The B2M qPCR reaction proceeds

137

with a forward primer placed in exon 2 and a reverse primer spanning the exon 3/4 junction to

138

avoid amplification of the genomic B2M gene. With B2M cDNA, the primers produce an amplicon

139

of 97 nucleotides, whereas the amplicon from the B2M gene itself spans 1974 nucleotides.

140
141

One-step RT-qPCR against SARS-CoV-2

142

The effect of GITC on a corresponding one-step SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR reaction was examined

143

using the dilution series of extracted RNA from OP and NP samples from the COVID-19 patient.

144

SARS-CoV-2 specific RT-qPCR was also performed on samples from three previously SARS-

145

CoV-2 positive, and a true negative, individual, to examine if non-specific amplification might

146

occur. Three negative controls were used; NP and OP samples from a healthy individual and a test

147

without sample. A primer and detection probe set against human RNase P mRNA was used as an

148

internal positive control. The RT-qPCR was performed using SuperScript™ III One-Step RT-PCR

149

System with Platinum™ Taq DNA Polymerase (12574-026, Invitrogen). Each 25 µL reaction

150

contained 5 µL of sample, 12.5 µL of the 2x Superscript™ III reaction mix (a buffer containing

151

0.4 mM of each dNTP and 3.2 mM MgSO4), 0.4 µL 50 mM MgSO4, 0.05 µL of 20 µg/µL (1 µg

152

BSA/reaction) of nonacetylated bovine serum albumin (BSA, 10711454001, Roche), 1 µL

153

SuperScript™ III RT/Platinum Taq Mix and 1.85 µL of primer/probe mix (2019-nCoV CDC EUA

154

Kit, 10006606, IDT). Primer and probe concentrations are outlined in Table 1. The thermal cycling

Preparation of a SARS-CoV-2 RNA dilution series using the GPC-extraction method

161

An OP sample swab was collected from a healthy individual and processed as described above.

162

From the upper aqueous phase, 7.5 µL was carefully transferred to a new tube without disturbing

163

the interphase, and spiked with 2.5 µL of Twist Synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA Control 1

164

(MT007544.1) to make a stock of 250.000 RNA copies/µL. This stock solution was used in a serial

165

dilution with the remaining, un-spiked, aqueous phase to create a series of positive controls

166

containing 3125, 781, 195, 48, 12, 3 or 0.76 RNA copies/µL. From each of these, 5 µL was used

167

in a 25 µL one-step RT-qPCR reaction thus achieving a final number of 15625, 3906, 977, 244,

168

61, 15 and 3.8 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per one-step RT-qPCR reaction.

RESULTS

171

GITC/RNA dilution thresholds compatible with efficient two-step RT-qPCR

172

To investigate how GITC affected the efficiency of each step of an RT-qPCR reaction, we set up

173

two-step B2M RT-qPCRs in the presence of variating concentrations of GITC. The B2M mRNA

174

was extracted from OP and NP swabs from a healthy individual to mimic how patient material is

175

obtained for SARS-CoV-2 testing. First, swabs were treated with the GPC solution. After mixing

176

and centrifugation, this solution separated into an upper aqueous phase containing RNA, GITC and

177

other salts, an interphase and a lower organic phase both containing DNA and proteins. The upper

178

RNA/GITC aqueous phase was retrieved and diluted and used directly in an RT reaction at different

179

final dilutions (ranging from 8x to 100x) followed by detection of B2M by qPCR with SYBR green

180

(Figure 1). Consistent with GITC being a concentration-dependent mixed inhibitor (14), amplicons

181

only appeared in the qPCR when the initial RT step was conducted with GITC dilutions ≥50x

182

(Figure 1). Using the NP swab samples, amplicons were detected in the qPCR reaction with cycle

183

threshold (Ct) values of 30-31 at a 50x GITC dilution. At the higher GITC dilution (100x),

184

amplicons were detected at a later time with Ct-values > 35, likely due to the increased dilution of

185

the B2M mRNA template in these reactions. When OP swabs were used, amplicons were similarly

186

detected at ≥50x GITC dilutions (Fig. 1), but with a slightly higher Ct-values of 36. This difference

187

in Ct thresholds for NP and OP swabs samples likely reflects differences in the amounts of cells

188

obtained by the different sampling methods. Together, these results confirm that the RT-qPCR can

189

proceed in the presence of low concentrations of GITC. The size of the B2M amplicons was

190

examined using gel electrophoresis, and all amplicons were found to have the expected size of 97

191

nucleotides; no amplification of the genomic B2M gene was observed, and no amplicons were

192

present in reactions without RT or sample. These results confirmed that the simplified GPC-

193

extraction method is capable of providing RNA that can serve as a template in RT-qPCR.

194
195

GITC/RNA dilution thresholds compatible with efficient one-step SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR

196

We next tested if the simplified GPC-extraction method was compatible with detection of SARS-

197

CoV-2 in a hospitalised COVID-19 patient who had tested virus-positive three weeks earlier using

198

the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 test (Roche diagnostics). OP and NP samples were obtained from the

199

patient, three former COVID-19 patients, and a healthy individual. For SARS-CoV-2 detection,

200

we used a one-step RT-qPCR (11) with two different sets of primers and detection probes (N1 and

201

N2) (15) (Table 1) specific for the conserved SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N) gene.

203

RNA was extracted from the OP and NP swabs and based on the B2M RT-qPCR results, the

204

aqueous phase with RNA and GITC was used at a 50x, 75x, or 100x final dilution in the one-step

205

SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCRs. The OP swab sample from the COVID-19 patient yielded Ct-values of

206

27 at the 100x dilution for both duplicates for the N1 primer set, and Ct-values of 31 for both

207

duplicates for the N2 primer set (Figure 2a). The RNase P internal control PCR resulted in Ct-

208

values of 30 for both duplicates. No amplification was detected using the NP sample, which could

209

reflect intermittent, low and/or no viral shedding from NP cells at this time (11), or problems with

210

sampling from the nasopharynx. The three former COVID-19 patients who tested negative for

211

SARS-CoV-2 using the cobas® SARS-CoV-2 test on the day of comparison, and the healthy

212

control, were virus-negative and RNase P positive. These results confirmed that the simplified

213

GPC-extraction method, combined with a one-step RT-qPCR reaction, can be used to detect SARS-

214

CoV-2 in an infected individual and that unspecific amplification does not seem to occur.

215
216

The simplified GPC-extraction allows detection of ~4 copies of SARS-CoV-2 per RT-qPCR

217

To assess the sensitivity of the COVID-19 diagnostic test flow, the one-step RT-qPCR was

218

performed on a dilution series of a synthetic SARS-CoV-2 control RNA. RNA from an OP swab

219

from a healthy individual was extracted using the simplified GPC-extraction method, after which

220

some of the aqueous phase was spiked with the SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA to a final

221

concentration of 250000 copies/µL. This spiked sample was used to create a dilution series ranging

222

from 15625 to 3.8 copies/µL using the un-spiked aqueous phase from the sample as the diluent to

223

retain consistent amounts of GITC and swab components in the RT-qPCRs. In accordance with the

224

COVID-19 diagnostic test flow, each spiked sample was used at a final GITC dilution of 100x and

225

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected with N1 or N2 primers, and using RNase P primers as positive

226

control.

227
228

Amplicons were detected in all dilutions of the SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA down to 3.8 copies

229

with the N1 primers (Figure 2b). This sensitivity is consistent with that reported for other primers

230

that target the N gene (N-Sarbeco, Tib-Molbiol, Berlin, Germany) that showed a detection limit of

231

8.3 copies/reaction when used with a commercial RNA extraction kit (MagNA Pure 96 system,

232

Roche, Penzberg, Germany) and the same one-step RT-qPCR (11). The ability to detect ~4 copies

233

of viral RNA in the RT-qPCR reaction translates into ~104 viral copies per swab, which is more

234

than 10 fold lower than the average virus load per NP or OP swab from symptoms onset to day five

235

(6.76x105 copies per swab) and later (3.44x105 copies per swab) (10, 11). The N2 primers proved

236

less sensitive, detecting synthetic RNA down to only 244 copies/reaction in our set-up. It cannot,

237

however, be excluded that the sensitivity is nearer the next testing point of 61 copies/reaction. The

238

negative control with no added virus showed no amplification, whereas efficient amplification was

239

observed with all positive control reactions targeting RNase P. Together, these data demonstrate

240

that the simplified GPC-extraction method allows for similar detection sensitivity in the one-step

241

RT-qPCR as a currently utilised kit-based RNA extraction methods.

242
243

Based on combined experiments, we outlined a COVID-19 diagnostic test flow from patient-to-

244

result that covers patient sampling, RNA extraction by the simplified GPC-extraction method, and

245

one-step RT-qPCR detection (Figure 3).

date, such tests typically combine the use of a front-end RNA extraction kit and a one-step RT-

251

qPCR detection kit. Many commercial RNA extraction kits have been shown to not fully inactivate

252

the virus, potentially putting healthcare personnel that handles the samples at risk of SARS-CoV-

253

2 infection (18). Similarly, several recently published quick RNA-extraction methods (7, 16, 17)

254

that rely on inactivation of the virus by heat, do not completely inactivate the virus (18). In contrast,

255

the GPC-solution fully inactivates corona viruses such as MERS-CoV (12), adding a desirable

256

safety aspect to this method.

257
258

The GITC salt is a mixed inhibitor of PCRs, affecting both the function of polymerase enzymes

259

and the melting temperature of primer/template duplexes (14). GITC is therefore usually removed

260

from the RNA by precipitation of the RNA with isopropanol, centrifugation and washing of the

261

RNA pellet with 70% ethanol after which the pellet is dissolved in H2O. This process requires

262

expertise in RNA handling as GITC can co-precipitate with the RNA, and too vigorous pipetting

263

or wrongly handled RNA pellet solvation can result in RNA loss. A previous study demonstrated

264

that GITC had only a modest inhibitory effect at a concentration of 9 µg/µL (~75 mM) (14),

265

prompting us to speculate that the RNA/GITC aqueous phase could be used directly in RT-qPCR

266

without precipitation, centrifugation, washing and solvation if the solution was diluted below the

267

~75mM threshold. Our results robustly demonstrate that a dilution of 50x and 100x of the aqueous

268

phase is compatible with one- and two-step RT-qPCRs, respectively, and that approximately ~4

269

copies of SARS-CoV-2 can be detected, equivalent to ~104 virus copies per NP or OP swab. The

270

difference between the one- and two-step RT-qPCRs results are likely due to the extended period

271

of exposure of the PCR polymerase to GITC salts during the latter procedure.

272
273

As the simplified GPC-extraction method presented here rapidly inactivates the virus, it allows

274

detection by RT-qPCR in laboratories not classified to handle infectious air-borne viruses. The

275

GCP-solution also denatures proteins to prevent enzymatic degradation of the viral RNA genome,

276

which facilitates sample storage prior to extraction when needed. Moreover, the simplified GCP-

277

extraction method utilises equipment and reagents common to clinical and molecular biology

278

laboratories, thus removing the reliance on commercial RNA-extraction kits that presents a

279

bottleneck for large-scale SARS-CoV-2 testing. The simplified GPC-extraction method shortens

280

the time from patient sampling to testing relative to using the full GPC-extraction protocol (19),

281

but, more importantly, excludes the steps that require experience with RNA precipitation, washing

282

and reconstitution. The resulting lowered complexity makes this simplified method amenable to

283

non-RNA-experts, thereby increasing the number of laboratories at which these tests can be

284

performed. The sensitivity of the downstream RT-qPCR was similar to that reported previously

285

(11) and appears superior to that of other RT-qPCR protocols, including the cobas® SARS-CoV-

286

2 test (20). The difference in sensitivity between the N1 and N2 primer sets is important when

287

evaluating the result of SARS-CoV-2 test using both primers sets as confirmatory for the infection,

288

since a negative result for the N2 primers, but positive result for the N1 primers, could simply

289

reflect a lower viral load in the tested infected individual, compared to a patient with two positive

290

results.

291
292

In the here-presented protocol we add the virus-inactivating TRI-reagent after the collected samples

293

are transferred to the laboratory, where this solution can be safely handled in a fume hood. It is

294

tempting to speculate that a test tube could be developed that enables contact between the swab

295

and the TRI-reagent at the point of sampling, without exposing testing personal to the reagent, thus

296

inactivating the virus at the earliest possible time point in the diagnostic procedure.

297
298

In summary, our protocol for RNA extraction relieves the dependence on expensive commercial

299

kits that have become a bottleneck in the diagnosis of the virus, and ensures the safety of healthcare

300

workers testing for SARS-CoV-2 infections, which in turn expands the number of testing

301

laboratories and thus testing capacity.
