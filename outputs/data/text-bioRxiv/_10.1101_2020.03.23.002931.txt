Abstract
Rapid screening and low-cost diagnosis play a crucial role in choosing the correct course of
intervention e.g., drug therapy, quarantine, no action etc. when dealing with highly infectious
pathogens. This is especially important if the disease-causing agent has no effective treatment, such as
the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (the pathogen causing COVID-19), and shows no or similar
symptoms to other common infections. We report a silicon-based integrated Point-of-Need (PoN)
transducer (TriSilix) that can chemically-amplify and detect pathogen-specific sequences of nucleic
acids (NA) quantitatively in real-time. Unlike other silicon-based technologies, TriSilix can be
produced at wafer-scale in a standard laboratory; we have developed a series of methodologies based
on metal-assisted chemical (wet) etching, electroplating, thermal bonding and laser-cutting to enable a
cleanroom-free low-cost fabrication that does not require processing in an advanced semiconductor
foundry. TriSilix is, therefore, resilient to disruptions in the global supply chain as the devices can be
produced anywhere in the world. To create an ultra-low-cost device, the architecture proposed
exploits the intrinsic properties of silicon and integrates three modes of operation in a single chip: i)
electrical (Joule) heater, ii) temperature sensor (i.e. thermistor) with a negative temperature coefficient
that can provide the precise temperature of the sample solution during reaction and iii)
electrochemical sensor for detecting target NA. Using TriSilix, the sample solution can be maintained
at a single, specific temperature (needed for isothermal amplification of NA such as Recombinase
Polymerase Amplification (RPA) or cycled between different temperatures (with a precision of ±1.3
°C) for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) while the exact concentration of amplicons is measured
quantitatively and in real-time electrochemically. A single 4-inch Si wafer yields 37 TriSilix chips of
10×10×0.65 mm in size and can be produced in 7 hours, costing ~US $0.35 per device. The system is
operated digitally, portable and low power – capable of running up to 35 tests with a 4000 mAh
battery (a typical battery capacity of a modern smartphone). We were able to quantitatively detect a
563-bp fragment (Insertion Sequence IS900) of the genomic DNA of M. avium subsp.
paratuberculosis (extracted from cultured field samples) through PCR in real-time with a Limit-of-

1. Introduction
Despite the advancement of diagnostic technologies targeting nucleic acids (NA), there are still no
rapid, handheld, low-cost, easy-to-use and integrated solutions for the testing of infectious diseases at
the Point-of-Need (PoN). This is unfortunately the case for pathogens infecting humans, animals or
even plants. This large gap in the diagnostic workflow hampers attempts to contain infectious
pathogens from spreading by rapid and early detection. This technological gap has become, once
again, evident with the spread of COVID-19, the diagnosis of which continues to depend heavily on
centralized laboratories with specialized personnel and facilities, which in turn slows down testing
and delays treatment.
NA make excellent targets for the direct detection of pathogens due to their high specificity.
Unlike other biomarkers, such as antibodies or non-genetic molecules originating from pathogens, NA
can be chemically amplified, enabling direct detection of low numbers of pathogens (down to single
organisms). Hence tests targeting NA tend to be exceptionally sensitive. NA-based reagents (e.g.,
primers) for NA testing can also be produced synthetically rapidly and on a large scale; DNA-based
molecules, in particular, are highly stable, therefore, do not require a cold-chain for storage, making it
especially suitable for PoN testing.1 Ability to produce NA quickly also increases the speed of
development and deployment of new test kits to health systems, providing much needed diagnostic
capabilities for the detection of novel pathogens (such as SARS-CoV-2). Despite the massive
advantages, on-site testing of NA has been limited.
There are several molecular methods to amplify NA for detection with high specificity e.g.,
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), stranddisplacement amplification (SDA), recombinase-polymerase amplification (RPA). While PCR
requires thermocycling; emerging isothermal methods such as LAMP and RPA, do not, removing the
need for sophisticated instruments.2,3 On the other hand, PCR is a simple process, requiring few
reagents. It is also the gold standard for NA-based laboratory diagnostics with a solid support
infrastructure. Amplification strategies are traditionally combined with fluorescence-based optical
methods of detection to produce a quantitative analytical signal. Optical methods, even though

sensitive, require expensive instruments.4 The fluorescent labels used in optical detection are also
difficult to handle and susceptible to photobleaching. Optical detection systems have been difficult to
miniaturize and largely limited to centralized laboratories, however, some early concepts have been
proposed by various groups in the literature.5–10
Despite low-cost onsite testing for infectious diseases is being the holy grail of NA
diagnostics, there are still no inexpensive and handheld solutions in the market that can provide truly
portable, rapid NA detection. Commercially available, benchtop optical lab instruments such as
GeneXpert (Cephied) have already made a substantial difference in the speed of NA-based diagnosis
of infectious diseases but the high cost of the instrument/tests, large size and power consumption have
prevented the adoption of these systems for use in the field.
The ideal, miniaturized, low-cost portable detection system for NA must be able to heat up
the sample from the patient to the desired temperature setpoint with high precision (using a heater and
temperature sensor) and measure the results of the amplification reactions quantitatively, all in an
integrated fashion. Using cleanroom-based semiconductor fabrication methods, such systems have
been reported;11–15 however, these devices require advanced methods of microfabrication that can
only be performed in a cleanroom, such as photolithography, vacuum etching/deposition etc. They
also do not exploit the intrinsic properties of the semiconductor materials that are used as substrates
(i.e. Si itself can be used both as a temperature sensor and electrical heater). Hence the devices
reported are complex and expensive. Because semiconductor foundries are mainly located in East
Asia, manufacturing and logistics are susceptible to disruptions in the supply chain due to unexpected
events (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic). There is, therefore, still no viable low-cost, rapid, quantitative,
integrated handheld NA testing solution available for use in the field with the potential for market
wide availability.
In this work, we report an integrated silicon-based Point-of-Need tri-modal NA transducer
(TriSilix) that can chemically-amplify and detect pathogen-specific sequences of NA quantitatively in
real-time (Figure 1 and Supporting Information Video V1). Unlike other silicon-based technologies,
TriSilix can be produced at wafer-scale in a standard laboratory and does not require fabrication in an

advanced semiconductor foundry. Hence it is resilient to disruptions in the global supply chain as the
devices can be produced anywhere in the world. To achieve cleanroom-free, low-cost fabrication, we
have developed a series of fabrication methodologies based on wet etching to form porous Silicon,
electroplating, thermal bonding and laser-cutting (Figure 1A). To reduce costs and complexity,
TriSilix exploits the intrinsic properties of the semiconductor Si which can be used as a resistive
heating device and thermistor simultaneously. TriSilix has three modes of operation: i) electrical
(Joule) heater, ii) thermistor with a negative temperature coefficient that can provide the precise
temperature of the sample solution during reaction and iii) label-free electrochemical sensor for
detecting target NA with methylene blue as a redox-active reporter. TriSilix works with both cyclic
and isothermal methods of amplification. We demonstrate that TriSilix can detect NA from both
bacteria (Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis) and viruses (SARS-CoV-2) with high
specificity.

2. Fabrication of TriSilix Chips
The fabrication of multilayered, composite TriSilix chips (dimension of each chip: 10×10×0.65 mm)
starts with a Si wafer.16 In this study we used lightly-doped p-type 4” Si wafers, however, wafers with
a larger diameter would also work.
First, each wafer is plated electrolessly for 20s (in 80 µM KAuCl4 and 0.5% HF) to form a
thin layer of gold particulate film. The wafer is then placed inside an etching bath containing an
aqueous solution of H2O2 and HF with a ratio of 1:20 v/v (30% H2O2: 10% HF) to perform metalassisted chemical etching (MACE) of Si for 10 min.17–19 This process forms a 500 nm thick
nanoporous Silicon (pSi) layer on each side of the wafer (Figure 2A). pSi plays a critical role in the
fabrication of TriSilix. The porous surface allows electroplating of high-quality metal films on the
surface of the Si substrate by creating an interlocking, high porosity surface to improve adhesion
(Figures 2B & C). Without this step, the metal films electroplated do not adhere to the surface of the
substrate.19 The pSi layer also allows thermal bonding of sheets of polymer films in an ordinary heat
press after patterning through laser-cutting (Figure 2D). After the formation of pSi surface, two layers
6

of polyethylene terephthalate-polyethylene (PET-PE) are thermally bonded on the bottom and top
surfaces of the Si wafer by heat pressing at 180 °C for 5 min. The heat pressed layers define the shape
of the Working Electrode (WE) on the top surface and electrical contacts for Joule heating/resistance
measurements on the bottom surface of the wafer. The patterned, and heat pressed polymer sheets
essentially act as masking layers for electroplating of the metal electrodes on the pSi surface
equivalent to photolithography-based patterning in conventional microfabrication. Next, the
unmasked areas of the pSi surface were cleaned in 5% HF and electroplated by Au in a bath
containing an aqueous solution of 10 mM KAu(CN)2/KCN for 10 min under a constant current of 10
mA versus Pt electrode (5×5 cm) yielding ~100 nm thick porous Au films. To achieve high
uniformity when electroplating across the wafer, we have designed, and 3D printed a custom,
electroplating platform that allows circular electrodes to be attached around the perimeter of the Si
wafer (Figure S1). To form a three-electrode electrochemical cell on the top surface, the Counter
(CE) and Reference Electrodes (RE) were created by heat pressing an Ag-plated Cu-PET-PE film,
patterned once again by laser cutting. Ag plating was performed in an aqueous solution of 10 mM
AgCN/KCN under an applied current of 20 mA versus Pt electrode (using the electroplating holder).
Once the basic device structure was created, the wafer was laser-diced into individual chips (37 chips
/ 4” Si wafer, Figure 1B). Using the Randles–Sevcik equation with experimentally measured gradient
values of 0.71 ± 0.08, we determined that the Au film has a 2x larger electroactive area than the
geometrically defined area due to the high porosity of the Au film, which is beneficial for highperformance electrochemical analysis (Figure S2). A sample reservoir (polyethylene; diameter: 5
mm; volume: 40 µl, Figure 1A) with two holes was thermally bonded across the three-electrode
electrochemical cell at 110±10 °C. The sample reservoir is specifically designed to prevent the
evaporation of the solvent during amplification of DNA at elevated temperatures. The final TriSilix
chip has a thickness of 490 µm (N=7) in the WE region and 650 µm in the RE/CE region (N=7)
without the sample reservoir. Figure 1C shows a schematic illustration of the functional building
blocks of TriSilix that provide trimodal operation: The three-electrode electrochemical cell fabricated
on the top surface is connected to an electrochemical reader (potentiostat) to provide an

electrochemical signal concerning the detection of NA (Mode 1). The electrodes fabricated at the
bottom of the device are connected to custom electronics to enable heating (Mode 2) and temperature
sensing (Mode 3) for thermoregulation.

3. Characterization of Temperature Transduction
NA amplification reactions require maintaining the sample at a temperature setpoint with high
°precision. For PCR, the duration of each heating step must also be carefully controlled. Because the
TriSilix uses Si, the substrate itself can be used both as an electrical heater and temperature sensor
(i.e. thermistor) without adding any additional components for temperature transduction. Si, a
semiconductor, heats up when an electrical current passes through it (known as Joule heating).
Because Si has a high thermal conductivity (~150 W m-1 °K-1 at 300 °K), the substrate can be heated
uniformly regardless of the path the current flows. The electrical resistance of Si also varies with
temperature with a negative correlation (within our experimental range of temperatures from RT to
110 °C); the electrical resistance of Si drops with increasing temperature due to generation of mobile
charge carriers allowing the use of Si substrate itself as a sensitive sensor of temperature. 20–22
We have applied electrical currents in the range 0-400 mA between two Au electrodes
deposited on the bottom of TriSilix chip to heat up the device electrically (the experiments were
performed at room temperature; ~25 °C). During this experiment, we used a thermal camera (FLIR
E4) to measure the temperature across the chip as a reference measurement. As illustrated in Figure
3A, TriSilix chip can be heated up to 110 °C, electrically. The relationship between the current
applied and substrate temperature was linear (with a positive slope) at steady-state with high
repeatability (slope: 232.3±8.7 °C A-1; R2 = 0.9971, N=5).
At room temperature, the electrical resistance of a batch of TriSilix chips was 5.4±0.6 Ω
(N=37) which varied linearly (with a negative slope of -6.1±0.4×10-3 °C-1; R2 = 0.9991, N=5) with the
temperature measured within the range from room temperature to 110 °C (Figure 3B). By measuring
the electrical resistance of the Si substrate, using the two electrical contacts at the bottom of the chip,
the temperature of the TriSilix chip can be precisely identified after calibration against a reference

measurement (see Supporting Information Section S3 for more information on the calibration of the
TriSilix thermistor). Temperature sensing is important for correct and fast execution of a NA
amplification program for at least two reasons: i) Temperature can be maintained at a precise setpoint
using a control algorithm such as proportional–integral–derivative control loop. ii) When cooling
(passively) or heating (actively), the speed of reaching a temperature setpoint can be maximized as
both heating and cooling depend on the outside temperature and device packaging (e.g., the
construction of the holder or cartridge). By only relying on the power applied, temperature control
cannot be achieved with high precision.
Although we expected formation of Schottky barriers and non-linear electrical characteristics
across the Au-Si interface, the I-V measurements (Figure 3C) demonstrated that the junction exhibits
relatively ohmic behavior with a linear I-V relationship (R2=0.9996) between -5V and +5V. The Si
substrate plus the Au contacts can, therefore, be modeled as a simple variable resistor, the magnitude
of which changes with temperature. We have designed a custom electrical circuit (Figure 3D) and
MATLAB-based graphical user interface (Figure S4) to control the temperature of the TriSilix chip at
a precise setpoint through software control. The circuit (Figure 3D) implements a voltage controlled
constant current source which can be adjusted digitally using a low-cost microcontroller (Arduino
Due). This circuit can also measure the voltage drop across the TriSilix chip; when a constant current
is applied, the resistance (hence the temperature) of the TriSilix thermistor can be calculated using the
voltage reading, and Ohm’s law. Using the MATLAB program and the custom electrical circuit
board, we were able to run a temperature program (Figure 3E) and maintain the TriSilix chip at a
given temperature setpoint over time. This is crucial for both cyclic and isothermal NA amplification
reactions.

4. Characterization of Electrochemical Sensing
We produced a thermally-stable silicone-based holder encased in a 3D printed polylactic acid (PLA)
housing (Figures 3F and S5) to characterize the performance of electrochemical sensing using the
TriSilix chip. The silicone holder also contained five embedded gold-plated stainless-steel electrodes

to make electrical contacts with the three electrodes positioned at the top for electrochemical NA
sensing and four at the bottom for heating and temperature sensing.
First, we characterized the electrochemical redox processes for methylene blue (MB) using
cyclic voltammetry (Figure 4A). We chose MB because the electrochemical approach we used for the
detection of DNA involves the use of MB23–25 as an intercalating redox reporter. During NA
amplification, MB is intercalated between guanine-cytosine base pairs of the double-stranded DNA
(ds-DNA) which provides an electroanalytical signal correlated with the concentration of ds-DNA in
the sample. We prepared a 125 µg mL-1 solution of MB in 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline pH 7
(PBS) and swept across a range of potentials between -400 to 200 mV at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 to
characterize the electrochemical processes involving MB and electrodes. We determined that the
anodic peak current, originating from the oxidation of MB on the electrode surface, appears at −67±2
and cathodic peak (due to reduction) at −97±4 mV versus Ag (Figure 4A). The absence of peaks with
nearly overlapping anodic and cathodic curves in buffer alone indicates that the electrodes are
electrochemically and mechanically stable and high performance (e.g., low capacitive current). We
have performed (Figure 4B) square wave voltammetry (SWV), a substantially more sensitive
electroanalytical method, to measure the concentration of MB in PBS in a range between 0 - 125 µg
mL-1 using a potential window from -500 mV to -250 mV versus Ag (corresponding to the anodic
process). The SWV measurements using TriSilix produces an electroanalytical signal (peak current
intensity) that is linearly related to the concentration of MB in the range 0.5 µg mL−1 – 80 µg mL−1
with an R2 = 0.9963 (Figure 4C– curve denoted by ‘RT’). We have also characterized the analytical
performance of TriSilix for performing SWV measurements when the chip was operated at elevated
temperatures. To prevent evaporation of the solvent (i.e. water) from the sample solution, a small
amount (10 µL) of mineral oil was added to the reservoir. Since both isothermal and cyclic NA
amplification reactions require heating; the effect of temperature on the electrochemical
measurements is important. As shown in Figure 4C, the peak current intensity (measured from the
recorded SWVs) increased two to four times in comparison to room temperature when operated at
higher temperatures; this is due to enhanced transport of the analyte to the surface of the electrode.26–

With increasing temperature, however, the error bars also widen, indicating that the precision of the

measurement decreases. We speculate that this could be related to thermal and electrical crosstalk
between the heater and the electrochemical sensing structures which introduce additional noise to the
electroanalytical measurements at higher temperatures. We have also studied the thermal stability of
MB over time (Figure 4D). In this experiment, we added MB to the PCR and RPA mastermix
solutions to simulate the conditions during isothermal and cyclic amplification reactions. As
illustrated in Figure 4D (and Figure S6), MB remained relatively stable both at 40 °C over 45 mins
(i.e. RPA conditions) and 35 cycles of PCR conditions (30 sec for each step at 94 °C, 63 °C and 72
°C; every 5th cycle, the temperature is reduced to 40 °C for the measurement to increase precision as
illustrated in Figure S7) indicated by the small spread of the measurements. The SWV measurements
at elevated temperatures produced similar results to the measurements taken at room temperature (25
°C) in terms of repeatability, in agreement with the findings in the literature by other groups although
we did observe a slight decrease in stability for the PCR conditions (i.e. higher temperatures).23 The
results of the thermal stability experiments indicate that MB is a sufficiently stable redox-active
reporter for use in NA amplification reactions at elevated temperatures.

5. Real-time Quantitative Detection of DNA During Amplification Reactions
Using the TriSilix chip, we have performed real-time and quantitative RPA (isothermal, qRPA) and
PCR (cyclic, qPCR) amplification of DNA using its temperature transduction capabilities and
measured the concentration of reaction products – smaller fragments of ds-DNA, i.e. amplicons –
using the electrochemical DNA sensor, quantitatively and in real-time. During amplification, the
number of amplicons increases exponentially with time if the DNA target is present in the sample.
When new amplicons are generated, MB interacts with the G-C pairs and can no longer participate in
the electron-transfer reactions with the working electrode hence the electroanalytical signal,
originating from the redox-active reporter, decreases with increasing concentration of amplicons (and
the target DNA in the original sample).

We performed qRPA using TriSilix with MB as the redox-active reporter. We used the
TwistAmp Basic kit (TwistDx, UK) with the positive (3.2 kbp template, 144-bp amplicons) and
negative (100-bp CTX-M ESBL; extended-spectrum beta-lactamases) DNA controls in the
experiments. We have slightly modified the mastermix solution provided in the kit to contain 10 µg
mL-1 of MB to enable electrochemical detection in real time. 30 µL of the modified-mastermix was
introduced into sample reservoir of TriSilix followed by the addition of 10 µL of mineral oil to
prevent evaporation. The sample was heated to 40 °C for 40 min and a square-wave voltammogram
was recorded every 2.5 min during the reaction. As shown in Figure 5A, while the electroanalytical
signal (normalized peak current intensity) remained relatively unchanged for the negative control, the
positive control (50 – 150 nM according to the manufacturer) showed a large drop in signal in the
form of a characteristic sigmoidal profile. This result demonstrates that TriSilix can perform real-time
and quantitative DNA analysis through (isothermal) RPA reactions.
In the next experiment, we have performed qPCR analysis of genomic DNA extracted from
clinical samples of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) K10 strain. MAP is the
causative microorganism of Johne’s Disease affecting ruminant animals and is controversially
associated with Crohn's Disease in humans. MAP is, therefore, an important analytical target which
requires routine testing in centralized laboratories through microbial cultures or conventional
fluorescence qPCR (lasting up to 3 hours). 29–31 Using TriSilix, we have first performed a titration
experiment to determine the limit-of-detection (LoD) of genomic DNA from MAP K10 without
amplification over a range of 0-200 pg (Figure 5B). Once again, we performed SWV as the analytical
method and measured anodic and cathodic peak current intensities originating from MB as the
electroanalytical signal. Without DNA amplification, we were able to detect genomic DNA of MAP
K10 (4,829 kbp) down to an LoD of 0.8 pg from cathodic peak current intensities in comparison to a
LoD of 1.2 pg provided by the anodic peak current intensities; the cathodic peak current intensity was,
therefore, used as the electroanalytical signal in the following PCR experiments. We performed qPCR
using the TriSilix chip to amplify and quantify small amounts (0 – 500 fg) of DNA of MAP K10 in
real-time (Figure 5C). The forward primer (5´-GCC GCG CTG CTG GAG TTG A-3´) and reverse

primer (5’- CGC GGC ACG GCT CTT GTT -3´), were used to amplify a 563 nucleotide segment of
IS900 (204–766 of GenBank Accesion Number AE016958.1; National Center for Biotechnology
Information, USA), which has 17 repeats in the genome of MAP K10. Using the qPCR approach
shown in Figure S7, we were able to measure as low as 20 fg of genomic DNA of MAP K10 which is
equivalent to detection of a single bacterium in the sample. We also characterized the same samples
using a commercial laboratory qPCR (IDvet, UK) using a test manufactured by ID GeneTM as a goldstandard (Figure S8). The results produced by TriSilix were similar or better in comparison to those
produced by the commercially available, sophisticated laboratory instrument; for 20 fg of MAP K10
DNA, the resulting Ct (cycle threshold) value was 30 using TriSilix, 5 cycles shorter compared to the
value obtained using the commercial qPCR (Ct=35).
In a final experiment, using TriSilix, we performed qPCR analysis of the complimentary
DNA (cDNA) of SARS-CoV-2 (22712–22869 nucleotides of GenBank accession number
MN908947)32 the causative agent of COVID-19, (Figure 5D). We have selected the forward primer
(5´- CCTA CTA AAT TAA ATG ATC TCT GCT TTA CT-3´) and reverse primer (5’- CAA GCT
ATA ACG CAG CCT GTA -3’), to amplify the target sequence. As a negative control, we used a
cDNA fragment of another coronavirus, SARS-CoV (17741–17984 nucleotides of GenBank
accession number AY274119)33 responsible for the SARS outbreak in 2003. Because we did not have
access to patient samples, we used cDNA fragments produced synthetically by Integrated DNA
Technologies Inc. We used the same PCR thermal cycling and measurement program described in the
previous experiment involving MAP K10. Using TriSilix, we were able detect 1 pg of cDNA of
SARS-CoV-2 quantitatively, in real-time with specificity against a cDNA sequence from a similar
virus (SARS-CoV), in as low as 20 cycles of PCR (lasting ~40 min). After 35 cycles, the difference in
the electroanalytical signal was five times, showing clear separation.

6. Conclusions
TriSilix is a low-cost, high-precision, integrated nucleic acid amplification and detection technology
that is ideally suited for point-of-need diagnosis of infectious pathogens (bacteria, viruses etc.)

requires minimal sample handling and allow operation by minimally trained personnel.
Although TriSilix is a silicon-based technology, it does not need a cleanroom for fabrication;
chips can be produced in a standard wet-lab with easily accessible laboratory equipment worldwide.
Because fabrication in an advanced silicon foundry is not needed, reliance on the global supply chains
is substantially reduced; silicon foundries are located only in a few countries in the world. Each
TriSilix chip costs ~0.35 USD (cost of materials is shown in Table S9) when produced at wafer-scale
with 4-inch wafers but the cost could be reduced further by moving to 8-inch wafers, decreasing the
size of each chip and optimizing the fabrication process (for example, the gold contacts at the bottom
of the TriSilix chip could be replaced by another appropriate metal to form Ohmic contacts). Due to
its small size, integrated form-factor, and low-power requirements, TriSilix can be controlled with a
portable, battery-operated handheld analyzer. Using a Li-ion battery with a 4000 mAh capacity (a
typical rating for batteries in modern smartphones), TriSilix is estimated to perform at least 40 tests
using isothermal amplification reactions at 40 °C lasting 30 min or 13 tests using 35 cycles of PCR
(these estimates assume that the electronics for the handheld analyzer also draw 50 mA while
operating).
The TriSilix technology has the following three disadvantages: (i) currently TriSilix uses MB
as the redox-active reporter to quantify the products of the NA amplification reactions in real-time.
MB is known to polymerize and its activity also slightly decreases over time at elevated temperatures.
This issue, however, can be addressed by the use of redox-active metal-complexes that also intercalate
with DNA, several of which have already been reported in the literature for real-time NA
amplification10,23,34–36 (ii) TriSilix currently requires purified DNA samples for operation. (iii) Because
sample reservoir and polymer films are attached thermally at 110 °C, TriSilix cannot be operated
beyond this temperature without causing debonding of the layers and leaks from the sample reservoir.
For most NA amplification processes, however, 110 °C is sufficiently high. In case higher

temperatures are needed (for example for on-chip sample prep), the fabrication process would need to
be modified and thermoplastics with a higher melting point could be used.
In the future, we will design a handheld analyzer and include all electronics needed for the
operation of TriSilix in the same device to simplify and enable its use in the field (currently the
potentiostat for electrochemical NA sensing and driver electronics for heating + temperature sensing
are separate). We will also add capabilities to communicate with smartphones to have access to the
cloud so that the result of each diagnostic test can be passed to health agencies remotely.37,38 To
enable on-site testing, we will implement on-chip lysis capabilities (such as mechanical39 or heatinduced cell lysis40) to analyze the samples taken directly from the subject without further sample
prep. We will also implement on-chip reverse transcription to enable analysis of RNA. TriSilix would
be particularly useful in emergency situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, where rapid, early,
on-site detection of the virus would accelerate intervention and reduce the spread of the pathogen.
Since TriSilix is a low-cost, high-performance NA detection technology, it is expected to find
applications beyond infectious diseases which may include genetic analysis of various plants, animals
or detection of genetic diseases. TriSilix is a versatile platform and could also be adapted for
electrochemical detection of non-genetic targets (e.g., through the use of antibodies) with on-chip
incubation capabilities to deliver accelerated results at the Point-of-Need.

7. Methods and Materials
Fabrication
Preparation of pSi. Silicon wafers (p-type Siegert Wafer, 525 ± 25 μm thickness, 0−100 Ω·cm,
lightly doped) were cleaned with acetone, rinsed with distilled water, and then immersed in a 3:1
piranha solution (95% H2SO4/30% H2O2 v/ v) at 80 °C to remove organic residues. The wafers were
dried in air and immersed in a batch containing an aqueous solution of 80 µM KAuCl4 and 0.5% HF
for 20 s to deposit Au particles on the surface of the wafer electrolessly. The Si wafers were rinsed
with distilled water, dried and immersed in an etching bath (30% H2O2: 10% HF, 1:20 v/v ratio) for
MACE with for 10 min. All chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were purchased from Sigma.

Patterning and heat-transfer of polymer layers. PE sheets were laser-cut (Model: Trotec Speedy
100; Wavelength: 1µm; Power: 20 W) and the patterns were transferred to the porous surfaces of the
Si wafer (both front and back) by heat-pressing at 180 °C for 5 min. The regions cut out were later
electroplated to form the WE and electrical contacts. The Cu-PET (20 µm Cu; 23 µm PET) sheets
were purchased from UK Insulations Ltd. and laminated with an additional sheet of PE film at 180 °C
for 5 min in a heat press to improve thermal bonding on pSi surfaces. The Cu-PET-PE laminates were
also laser-cut using a fiber laser, electroplated with Ag and heat-pressed on the top side of the Si
wafer to form the electrodes for the CE and RE.
Electrodeposition of Au ang Ag. Immediately before electroplating with Au to form the electrical
contacts at the bottom of the wafer and WE on the top, each Si wafer was dipped into 5% HF to
remove the native oxide and produce an electrically conductive surface. The wafers were
electroplated with Au in a bath containing 10 mM KAu(CN)2/KCN using a 5 cm x 5 cm Pt electrode
(SPA plating) as anode at a constant current of 10 mA. The Cu-PET-PE film was first treated with 0.1
M H2SO4, rinsed and electroplated with Ag in an aqueous solution of 10 mM AgCN/KCN under an
applied current of 20 mA using a 5 cm x 5 cm Pt electrode as anode. All chemicals, unless otherwise
stated, were purchased from Sigma.

DNA Amplification and Extraction
RPA. The RPA Premix solution was prepared by adding and vortexing 25 µL of 2X buffer, 8 µL of
10 mM dNTPs (Fisher Scientific), 5 µL of 10X E Mix and 5 µL of control primer Mix (30 bp) in a 0.2
mL Eppendorf tube. 2.5 µL of 20X core solution and 1 µL of 0.05 % MB were placed in the lid of the
tube and mixed with 10 inversions. The RPA Mastermix was made by mixing 3.5 µL of Nucleasefree ultrapure water (Fisher Scientific) with the Premix. This solution was subsequently mixed with
2.5 µL of 280 mM OAc and 1 µL of positive control DNA or 50 nM negative control (CTX-M ESBL:
5’-ATTGACGTGC TTTTCCGCAA TCGGATTATA GTTAACAAGG TCAGATTTTT
TGATCTCAAC TCGCTGATTT AACAGATTCG GTTCGCTTTC ACTTTTCTTC-3’; Sigma) to
create the final RPA mix. 30 µL of the final solution were added into the device chamber followed by

10 µL of mineral oil (Sigma) to prevent evaporation of water. All of the chemicals (unless otherwise
stated) were included in the TwistAmp® Basic Kit.
MAP K10 PCR. 50 µL of PCR mastermix solution in Nuclease-free ultrapure water contained 60
mM Tris-HCl Buffer pH 8.8 (Bio-Rad), 200 µM dNTPs, 200 nmol µL-1 of each primer (Biomers), 0.5
U Taq DNA polymerase and 20 µg mL-1 MB. 50 µL of PCR mix solution in nuclease-free water
contained 60 mM Tris-HCl Buffer pH 8.8 (Bio-Rad), 200 µM dNTPs, 200 nmol µL-1 of each primer
(Biomers), 0.5 U Taq DNA polymerase, 2 mM MgCl2, 20 µg mL-1 MB and 1 µL of MAP or
Nuclease-free ultrapure water. 30 µL of PCR mastermix or PCR mix solutions were added into the
sample reservoir of TriSilix for reaction, followed by 10 µL of mineral oil (Sigma) to prevent
evaporation. All chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were purchased from Fisher Scientific.
SARS-CoV PCR. The PCR Mix consisted of 0.5 U Taq polymerase, 1X Taq Polymerase buffer,

1 µM of each primer (Biomers), 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 30 µg mL-1 MB and 1 pg
cDNA (IDtdna). 30 µL of this solution were added into the sample reservoir of TriSilix for reaction,
followed by 10 µL of mineral oil (Sigma) to prevent evaporation. All chemicals, unless otherwise
stated, were purchased from Fisher Scientific.
Extraction of Genomic DNA: Genomic DNA was prepared from a 10ml culture of MAP K10 in
Middlebrook 7H9 supplemented with 10% Albumin Dextrose Catalase enrichment, 0.2% (vol/vol)
glycerol, 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 80 and 2µg/ml mycobactin j. Mycobacteria were harvested in early
to mid log phase of growth and the cells were pelleted at room temperature for 5 min at 14,000g.
Pellets were re-suspended in ATL buffer (Qiagen DNeasy® Blood & Tissue Kit) and the samples
were transferred to Lysing Matrix B tubes (0.1mm silica spheres). Samples were homogenized in a
FastPrep™ FP120 cell disruptor at 3 x 20s, Speed 6, followed by centrifugation at 14,000g for 5
minutes. Supernatants were transferred to fresh sterile micro centrifuge tubes and Proteinase K
(Qiagen DNeasy® Kit) was added followed by incubation overnight at 56oC. DNA was extracted
using DNeasy® Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Concentration (40 µg mL-1)
and purity of the DNA were determined using a Nanodrop and the absorbance ratios 260/280 and
260/230.

Characterization
Microstructural Characterization. Scanning electron micrographs were acquired using a Zeiss
Gemini Sigma 300 FEG SEM at 5 keV electron beam energy. Optical micrographs were obtained
with a Brunel SP202XM metallurgical microscope. A Nikon D3200 camera was attached to the
microscope for the acquisition of the images using DigiCamControl open-source software.
Electrical and Thermal characterization. The I-V curves for the characterization of the
metal−semiconductor junctions were acquired using a Keithley 2450 SourceMetter. Thermal images
were recorded using a FLIR E4 thermal camera.
Electrochemical Measurements. Cyclic (CV) and square wave (SWV) voltammograms were
acquired using a handheld potentiostat (PalmSens3, PalmSens BV, The Netherlands) with the
supplied PSTrace 5.3 software in a three-electrode setup. The following parameters were used for all
the SWV measurements: pulse amplitude of 100 mV, potential step of 5 mV and 50 Hz of frequency.
Prior to the DNA measurements by SWV, the sample reservoir was cleaned with DNA
decontamination reagent (Fisher Scientific) followed by Nuclease-free ultrapure water (Fisher
Scientific).
