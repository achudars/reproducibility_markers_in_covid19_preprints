Abstract
SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-2019 pandemic is an RNA virus prone to mutations.
Information on mutations within the circulating strains of the virus is pivotal to understand disease
spread and dynamics. Here, we analyse the mutations associated with 2,954 globally reported high
quality genomes of SARS-CoV-2 with special emphasis on genomes of viral strains from India.
Molecular phylogenetic analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in India form five
distinct phyletic clades designated R1-R5. These clades categorize into the previously reported S, G as
well as a new unclassified subtype. A detailed analysis of gene encoding the Spike (S) protein in the
strains across the globe shows non-synonymous mutations on 54 amino acid residues. Among these,
we pinpoint 4 novel mutations in the region that interacts with human ACE2 receptor (RBD). Further
in silico molecular docking analyses suggest that these RBD mutations could alter the binding affinity
of S-protein with ACE2 that may lead to changes in SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Strikingly, one of these
RBD mutations (S438F) is unique to a subset within the R4 clade suggesting intrinsic S-protein
variations in strains currently circulating in India. Together, our findings reveal a unique pattern of
SARS-CoV-2 evolution that may alert vaccine and therapeutic development.

Introduction
COVID-19, the highly transmittable and pathogenic viral infection caused by SARS-CoV-2, belongs to
betacoronavirus genus that is known to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome, coagulation
dysfunction and septic shock (Yang, P. and Wang, X. 2020). The rate of COVID-19 spread appears to
be more than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Chen, J. 2020) with 2,654,209 confirmed cases and 185,062
death

cases

reported

in

210

countries and

territories

around

the

world

(https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus). This increased transmission was recently correlated with
the high mutation frequency of SARS-CoV-2 strains (Yin, C. 2020).
The single stranded RNA genome of COVID-19 has 2,9891 nucleotides, possesses 14 ORFs encoding
29 proteins which include four structural proteins: Envelope (E), Membrane (M), Nucleocapsid (N) and
Spike (S) proteins, 9 accessory proteins and 16 non-structural proteins (Wu, A. et al. 2020, Gordon et
al. 2020). A recent study shows that mutations in the S-protein that mediates viral entry can modulate
viral pathogenesis (Shang et al., 2020). The S-protein is functionally bipartite with a proximal S1
segment that binds the host angiotensin-converting enzyme2 (ACE2) receptor (Wang et al., 2020) and
a distal S2 region helps in virus-host cell fusion separated by S1-S2 linker containing protease cleavage
sites. S1 subunit consists of a signal peptide (SP) followed by the N-terminal domain of unknown
function and the C-terminal domain consisting of receptor binding domain (RBD) and a receptor
binding motif (RBM) within. S2 subunit comprises a fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeats (HR1&HR2),
transmembrane domain (TM) and a short cytoplasmic domain (CP). This viral entry process requires
the S protein priming, which is facilitated by TMPRSS2, a serine protease that is produced by the host
cell (Hoffmann et al., 2020). Together, these features make S-protein the primary target for the
development of antibodies, entry inhibitors and vaccines (Du, L. et al.,2009; Wang, Q. et
al.,2016). Also, SNPs identified on S-gene may have an important role in its host range and
pathogenicity (Yin, C. 2020). Furthermore, identifying a complete set of variations in S-protein of
SARS-CoV-2 and their impact on human ACE2 affinity is much needed for the development of
therapeutic countermeasures. Thus, studying S- protein and their evolution can enhance our
understanding of host receptor affinity variations and virulence levels.
To study the evolutionary pattern of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating globally and in Indian
subcontinent and also to reveal structural and functional implications of amino acid variations present
in the S proteins, we analysed 2,954 SARS- CoV-2 complete genomes. Our analysis reveals that there
are at least 5 distinct clades of strains circulating in India. In addition, the global strains appear to have
acquired 54 mutations that are non-synonymous in the gene encoding S-protein among which 4
important mutations are on the RBD that may have direct implications on the infectivity of SARS-CoV2. Most importantly, we identify that one of these RBD mutations is unique to a set of strains currently
circulating in India.

Materials and Methods
Genome analysis
Complete and high coverage genomes were downloaded on April 6th, 2020 from the GISAID database.
This comprises a total of 3,060 genomes (>29,000 bp) and countries with less than ten genomes were
discarded for further analysis. In addition, we also added 30 Indian genomes downloaded on April 15th,
2020 for the analysis. The RefSeq genome (NC_045512) from Wuhan is taken as the reference. The
genes were predicted using Prokka (Seemann T; 2014), and the complete sequences of structural
proteins such as Spike, Membrane and Nucleocapsid proteins were extracted. The alignments of the
structural proteins were done using Mafft (maxiterate 1,000 and global pair-ginsi) (Katoh et al. 2002).
The alignments were visualized in Jalview (Waterhouse AM et al., 2009) and the amino acid
substitutions in each position were extracted using custom python script. We ignored the substitutions
that are present in only one genome and unidentified amino acid X. The mutations that are present in at
least two independent genomes in a particular position were further considered. These two criteria were
used to avoid mutations due to sequencing errors. The mutated amino acids were further tabulated and
plotted as a matrix using R script. The number of amino acid substitutions observed in S proteins were
compared against other structural proteins.
Phylogeny reconstruction
For the Maximum likelihood phylogeny, we have used 30 Indian Genomes (as on April 15th, 2020)
with the worldwide genomes sampled 10 per country and with Wuhan RefSeq strain as root. The
phylogeny was reconstructed using IQ-Tree (Nguyen et al., 2015), and the best model “TIM2+F+I” was
picked according to the ModelFinder (Kalyaanamoorthy et al., 2017). All the data used for
reconstructing the phylogeny was downloaded from the GISAID database. In addition, three random
samplings were done to check the consistency of the phylogeny.
Molecular docking analysis
The structural analysis of the mutated spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was done to assess the impact
of mutations on binding affinity towards human ACE2 receptor. The structures of wild type and mutated
Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the spike protein was modeled using the Swiss model (Schwede,
T. et al., 2003). The target sequence for spike protein was obtained from National Centre for
Biotechnology Information (YP_009724390.1) and the crystal structure of SARS-CoV Spike protein
was downloaded from Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6ACD) and used as the template (76.83% sequence
identity) for homology modeling (Dong, S. et al., 2020). The energy minimization of the modeled
structure was done by YASARA server (Krieger, E. et al., 2002), and each modeled structure was
superimposed with template structure and calculated the RMSD value in Pymol(Delano, W. L., 2002).
HADDOCK 2.4 webserver (De Vries et al., 2010) was used for docking of the wild and mutated spike

structures was calculated using PRODIGY webserver (Xue, Li C., et al., 2016).

Results and Discussion
Genome variations and phyletic pattern of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in India
We compared the whole genome of 2924 strains from 29 countries across the globe and 30 Indian strains
of SARS-CoV-2 with original Wuhan strain as reference (Wuhan RefSeq strain: YP_009724390.1), all
collected from GISAID database. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of these strains provides
distinct evolutionary features. However, country specific, monophyletic pattern was not observed in the
global distribution of SARS-CoV-2 strains (Figure 1).
Within this global distribution, we identify five major clades- R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 for strains
circulating in India (Figure 1). Among these, R1, R3, R4 and R5 belong to previously reported S and
G global subtypes whereas R2 stands out as a previously uncharacterized, unique cluster. In-depth
phylogenetic analysis shows peculiar features for Indian clades. Clade R1 consists of only one strain
from Kerala that belongs to S- subtype and is consistent with epidemiological travel history from
Wuhan, China. In addition, R1 defines 5 unique non-synonymous mutations in the orf1ab (I476V,
P2079L, Q5538Z), orf8 (L84S) and S gene (A930V). Clade R2 does not belong to any known S, V or
G subtypes and possess two non-synonymous substitutions in orf1ab (V378I, L3606F) and one
synonymous mutation on N gene (L139L). Clade R3, R4 and R5 belong to G subtype and show clear
epidemiological link to Italy but differ in their mutational profile. While two Indian strains in R3 contain
non-synonymous substitutions in the M-gene (D3G) and in the orf1ab (Z6697W), R4 possesses nonsynonymous mutation in orf1ab (S1515F) with an additional mutation in the RBD region of S-protein
(S438F) in 15% of the strains (Figure 1). Clade R5 has two non-synonymous substitutions in the N
gene (R203K, G204R). Our analysis is currently limited to only 30 genomes from India; hence require
further investigation using more genomes. Nevertheless, these findings reveal that along with global
strains unique subtypes of SARS-CoV-2 strains are currently circulating in India.

Global mutational profile of SARS-CoV-2 S protein.
Since mutations in S-protein have been linked with virus infectivity, we performed a high stringent, indepth mutational analysis to capture the global variations in the S-protein. Altogether, 54 mutations
were identified that belong to 1176 strains from 29 countries. These mutations were found to be
distributed across different domains of S-protein (Figure 2).
The N-terminally located signal peptide which helps S-protein in ER translocation during its
biosynthesis had two mutations L5F and L8V. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of S-protein of certain
beta-coronaviruses binds to sugars present on the host cell membrane for attachment. However, the
functions of SARS-CoV-2 NTD still need to be determined (Ou, X., et al., 2020) as these sugar binding
residues are absent (Li, F., 2015). In our analysis, we identify 20 amino acid substitutions in the NTD
region which account for the highest number of mutations within S-protein. Overall, NTD mutations
do not appear to perturb the properties of S-protein.

Figure 2: Matrix representing amino acid substitutions present in SARS-CoV-2 S protein of 2,954 genomes. Name
of countries and the number of genomes sampled are given on the Y-axis and the relevant amino acid residues
(single letter code) in the reference strain are given on the X-axis. Mutated amino acid residues and their
frequency of mutations are provided in matrix cells. Matrix cells are colour coded based on different domains of
S-protein shown at the top. Mutations which are present at least in two independent genomes at the same
position are represented in the matrix along with their positions.

RBD comprises of 223 amino acid long peptide in the S-protein is the most variable part of the
SARS-like coronavirus genomes (Zhou, P. et al., 2020; Wu, F. et al., 2020, Ortega et al., 2020). In this
region, we found mutations in 33 strains from different countries which fall into four amino acid
substitutions such as V367F, S438F, G476S, and V483A. V367F mutation is found in strains from
Hong Kong and France. A unique S438F mutation is found in the RBD region of only two Indian
strains, which is absent in global strains. G476S mutation is seen predominantly in 7 strains from the
USA and one from Belgium whereas V483A is found in 16 strains unique to the USA. However, these
four RBD mutations together represent only <2% of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating globally.
Further, to understand the evolutionary significance of these mutations, we compared RBDs from
SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV (2002) and Bat coronavirus RaTG13 strain, a suspected precursor of SARSCoV-2 (Figure 3). We found that the RBD from SARS-CoV-2 is only 73.4 % identical to SARS-CoV
but is 90.1 % identical to RaTG13. Interestingly, none of the amino acid changes observed in SARSCoV-2 matches with either RaTG13 or SARS-CoV (Figure 3). Hence, based on our findings, the
possibility of origin of a novel sub-lineage cannot be neglected.

Figure 3: Conservation of Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of SARS-COV-2 with its close relatives of SARS-CoV
and Bat RATG13. The red colored region shows the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and the yellow highlighted
region is the Receptor Binding Motif (RBM) in RBD region. The mutated residues are highlighted in light blue
color and substitutions are marked below in green.

Interestingly, we found four mutations in the linker region separating S1 and S2 segments of
S-protein viz., L611F, D614G, Q675H and A706V. Among these, D614G which corresponds to Gsubtypes of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be the most abundant mutation globally as well as in Indian
subcontinent, accounting for 52.26% (1,544) strains analyzed. This mutation is located outside RBD
and near to the furin cleavage site in the S1-S2 junction. The exact functional impact of this mutation
remains unclear. Although SARS-CoV-2 possesses a unique furin/ TMPRSS2 cleavage sites, mutations
are not observed in this region (Figure 2).
Several mutations were found in the S2 region. S2 region consists of proximal fusion peptide
(FP) followed by Heptad Repeat-1 ad 2 (HR1 and HR2), transmembrane domain (TM) and short distal
cytoplasmic tail (CT) (Figure 2). FP along with HR1 and HR2 plays a significant role in the fusion
between the virus and target cell membranes (Liu, Shuwen, et al., 2004; Tripet, Brian, et al., 2004). FP
is one of the highly conserved regions in S-protein (Cascella, Marco et al., 2020). We found five
mutations in the Fusion peptide region- A831V, D839Y, A845S, A846V and A852V. In addition, we
identified five mutated positions (D936Y/D936H, S939F, S940F/S940T, T941A, S943P) in the HR1
domain and only one in HR2 (D1163G). The functional implications of these mutations in regulating
SARS-CoV-2-host cell fusion need to be determined.
Structural analysis of RBD mutations
The amino acid substitutions at the RBD can have an influence on the overall binding affinity of the Sprotein with ACE2 receptor. Thus, the structural changes and differences in the binding affinity
corresponding to each mutation in the RBD (V367F, S438F, G476S and V483A) were analysed in detail
(Figure 4a and b).

the complex showing RBD mutations (V367F, S438F and V438A) (b) G476S in red color. (c-f) Visualization of
possible molecular rearrangements resulting from observed RBD mutations V367F (c), S438F (d), G476S (e) and
V483A (f) respectively.

Molecular replacement and docking studies allowed estimation of the binding affinity and dissociation
constant of the mutated structure in comparison with wild type. Each of the four mutations invariably
exhibit altered binding affinities with ACE2 receptor (Table-1). Although no changes were evident in
the interactions during conservative substitution of V367F (Figure 4c, Supplementary Figure 1a), the
binding affinity towards ACE2 receptor decreased (Kd = 1.4E-09) when compared to the wild type
protein complex (Kd = 4.3E-10). The amino acid substitution that is unique to Indian strains, S438F is
associated with alterations in hydrogen bonding with D442. Also, a new hydrogen bond with N437 is
formed in the mutant (Figure 4d, Supplementary Figure 1b). These structural alterations are
consistent with the reduced binding affinity observed in S438F mutant (Kd = 1.2E-09). The amino acid
mutation at position 476, G to S also made some changes to its interacting residues. In wild type protein
complex, G476 is forming two hydrogen bonds with T478 while this interaction is abolished in the
mutant. Also, the single hydrogen bond interaction with Q474 in the wild type was replaced to double
bond in mutant (Figure 4e, Supplementary Figure 1c) likely reducing the binding affinity with ACE2
(Kd = 2.5E-09). Though V483A mutant does not exhibit considerable alterations in hydrogen bonding,
reduced binding affinity was observed (Kd = 1.9E-09). We are currently performing additional
molecular docking studies to understand the RBD: ACE2 interface alterations in mutants. In nutshell,
our findings might shed light on understanding severity and dynamics of COVID 19 and also in
developing the right vaccines and therapeutics.
