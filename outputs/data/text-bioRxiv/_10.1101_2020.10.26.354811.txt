Abstract
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), exhibits high levels of mortality
and morbidity and has dramatic consequences on human life, sociality and global
economy. Neutralizing antibodies constitute a highly promising approach for treating
and preventing infection by this novel pathogen. In the present study, we
characterized and further evaluated the recently identified human monoclonal MD65
antibody for its ability to provide protection against a lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection of
K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. Eighty percent of the untreated mice succumbed 6-9
days post-infection while administration of the MD65 antibody as late as 3 days after
exposure, rescued all infected animals. In addition, the efficiency of the treatment is
supported by prevention of morbidity and ablation of the load of infective virions in
the lungs of treated animals. The data unprecedentedly demonstrate, the therapeutic
value of human monoclonal antibodies as a life-saving treatment of severe COVID-19
infection.

Introduction
Human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), specifically targeting surface viral proteins,
have increasingly demonstrated prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against various
viruses including HIV, Ebola, and the pathogenic beta-coronaviruses MERS-CoV and
SARS-CoV1-5. Neutralizing antibodies constitute a highly promising approach for
treating and preventing infection by the novel SARS-CoV-26. The viral surface spike
glycoprotein, is essential for viral attachment, fusion and entry into human cells and
thus considered as the major target for therapeutic neutralizing antibodies7-13.
Specifically, highly potent neutralizing antibodies target and block the binding of the
receptor binding domain (RBD) located in the S1 subunit of the spike, to the human
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)7,10 ,14.
A reliable animal model for COVID-19, is essential for the development of antiSARS-CoV-2 countermeasures and for deciphering the pathogenicity of the disease15.
Accordingly, mouse models that exploit the recombinant hACE2 expression, either by
transgenic or viral-transduction approaches were developed16-28. A transgenic mouse
strain expressing hACE2 under the K18 promoter (K18-hACE2) was shown to be
highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in significant viral load in the
lungs, heart, brain and spleen as well as mortality26,27,29. In response to the urgent
need for antibody-based therapy for COVID-19, several reports have demonstrated
efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection by neutralizing antibodies, primarily as
prophylactic protection10,19,30-32. These studies were based on non-lethal COVID-19
models of mice transduced to express hACE2, and did not demonstrate the efficacy of
Ab-based passive therapy administered at a significant time post-infection.
We have previously reported the isolation of human neutralizing Abs selected against
SARS-CoV-2 RBD by extensive screening of a phage-display library generated from
lymphocytes collected from infected individuals. Among these Abs, MD65 exhibited
the highest neutralization potency in vitro11. The aim of the current study was to
evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of this Ab in a lethal COVID-19 animal model by
assessing its prophylaxis and treatment abilities to protect K18-hACE2 infected mice.

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/ NP_068576.1)]. C-terminal his-tag as well as
a strep-tag, were included in order to facilitate protein purification. Expression of the
recombinant proteins was performed using ExpiCHOTM Expression system
(Thermoscientific, USA, Cat# A29133) following purification using HisTrapTM (GE
Healthcare, UK) and Strep-Tactin®XT (IBA, Germany).
MD65 scFv, derived from a phage-display library, was initially cloned as a scFv-Fc
Ab, as recently described11. To generate a full-length IgG, the VH and VL fragments
where re-cloned into pcDNA3.1-Heavy and pcDNA3.1-Kappa vectors, respectively.
These vectors, were designed to include IgG1 and Kappa chain constant domains, as
well as the appropriate signal sequences for the production of complete heavy and
light chains. The resulting antibody was further engineered to include three point
mutations in its Fc region: M252Y/S254T/T256E (YTE mutations). These mutations
were previously shown to increase antibody affinity to the human FcRn, at pH 6.0 and
hence, to improve the Ab’s serum half-life in rhesus macaques and humans33,35,36. The
antibody MD29 scFc-Fc, reported to target RBD and neutralize SARS-CoV-2 but not
inhibit ACE2-RBD interaction11, was similarly cloned and expressed as IgG-YTE.
Recombinant antibodies (scFv-Fc, IgG and IgG-YTE) were expressed using
ExpiCHOTM Expression system (Thermoscientific, USA, Cat# A29133) and purified
on HiTrap Protein-A column (GE healthcare, UK).
All purified proteins were sterile-filtered and stored in PBS. The integrity and purity
of the recombinant expressed proteins were confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis
(Supplementary Fig. 4).

ELISA
Direct ELISA was performed against SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit (expressed and
purified as recently described11) for binding evaluation and for Ab concentration
determination. Maxisorp 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were
coated overnight with 1 μg/ml of S1 protein in NaHCO3 buffer (50 mM, pH 9.6),
washed, and blocked with PBST at room temperature for 1 h. Human Abs were
visualized by AP-conjugated Donkey anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch,
USA, Cat# 709-055-149, lot 130049) used at 1:1,000 and further developed with
PNPP substrate (Sigma, Israel, Cat# N1891). For the quantification of MD65 Ab
presence in plasma or sera samples, standard curve included purified MD65 IgG-YTE
Ab at the concentration range of 2-3000 ng/ml (diluted in PBST). Correct ELISAbased quantification was confirmed by 4 non-immune sera samples (collected prior to
Ab-administration) containing exogenously-added known concentration of the Ab.
Standard curves confirmed as above, were calculated for each individual ELISA
plate/data set.
The endogenous humoral response was tested in mice sera samples collected at 14
dpi, evaluated by ELISA against SARS-CoV-2 spike, S1 and RBD essentially as
described above, using AP-conjugated Donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L) minimal cross
(Jackson ImmunoResearch, USA, Cat# 715-055-150, lot 142717) used at 1:2,000.

Biolayer interferometry (BLI) analysis
Binding studies were carried out using the Octet system (ForteBio, USA, Version 8.1,
2015) which measures biolayer interferometry (BLI). All steps were performed at
30°C with shaking at 1,500 rpm in a black 96-well plate containing 200 μl solution in
each well. For hACE2 competitive binding assay, streptavidin-coated biosensors were
loaded with biotinylated MD65 (10 µg/ml), as either scFv-Fc, IgG or IgG-YTE
antibody formats. Antibody-loaded sensors were first incubated with RBD (12
µg/ml), washed and incubated with hACE2 (20 µg/ml). MD29 Ab, previously shown
to bind RBD without blocking its binding to hACE211, was used as a control.
For the evaluation of MD65 affinity to human FcRn, anti-Fab coated sensors were
loaded with MD65 IgG or IgG-YTE (30 µg/ml), to reach 2.5 nm wavelength shift,
and then washed. Sensors were then incubated with different concentrations of FcRn
(Sino Biological #CT009-H08H; ranging from 75 to 300 nM) in pH 6.0, for 60 sec
(association phase) and transferred to buffer-containing wells for additional 60 sec

(dissociation phase). Binding and dissociation were measured as changes over time in
light interference after subtraction of parallel measurements from unloaded
biosensors. Sensorgrams were fitted with a 1:1 binding model using the Octet data
analysis software 8.1 (Fortebio, USA, 2015). All BLI experiments were repeated
several times.

Cells
Vero E6 (ATCC® CRL-1586TM) were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), MEM non-essential amino acids
(NEAA), 2 mM L-Glutamine, 100 Units/ml Penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml Streptomycin and
12.5 Units/ml Nystatin (P/S/N) (Biological Industries, Israel). Cells were cultured at
37°C, 5% CO2 at 95% air atmosphere.
ExpiCHO-S (Thermoscientific, USA, Cat# A29127) were used for expression of
recombinant proteins as described above.

Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)
Handling of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted in a BSL3 facility in accordance with the
biosafety guidelines of the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR). SARSCoV-2 (GISAID accession EPI_ISL_406862) strain was kindly provided by
Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany. Virus stocks were
propagated and tittered by infection of Vero E6 cells as recently described44. For
plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), Vero E6 cells were plated overnight (as
detailed above) at a density of 5×105 cells/well in 12-well plates. Antibody samples
were 2-fold serially diluted (ranging from 2 to 0.015 μg/ml) in 400 μl of MEM
supplemented with 2% FBS, NEAA, 2 mM L-Glutamine and P/S/N. 400 μl
containing 500 PFU/ml of SARS-CoV-2 virus were then added to the Ab solution
supplemented with 0.25% guinea pig complement sera (Sigma, Israel) and the
mixture incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 1 h. Monolayers were then washed once with
DMEM w/o FBS and 200 μl of each Ab-virus mixture was added in triplicates to the
cells for 1 h. Virus mixture w/o Ab was used as control. 2 ml/well overlay [MEM
containing 2% FBS and 0.4% Tragacanth (Sigma, Israel)] were added to each well
and plates were further incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 48 h. Following incubation,
the overlay was aspirated and the cells were fixed and stained with 1 ml of crystal

violet solution (Biological industries, Israel). The number of plaques in each well was
scored and the NT50 (Ab concentration at which the plaque number was reduced by
50%, compared to plaque number of the control, in the absence of Ab), was calculated
using the Prism software version 8 (GraphPad Software Inc., USA).

Animal experiments
Treatment of animals was in accordance with regulations outlined in the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Welfare Act and the conditions specified
in the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institute of Health,
2011). Animal studies were approved by the local ethical committee on animal
experiments (protocol number M-51-20 and M-56-20). Male and female K18-hACE2
transgenic (B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J HEMI) and C57BL/6 mice (Jackson
Laboratories, USA) were maintained at 20−22 °C and a relative humidity of 50 ± 10%
on a 12 h light/dark cycle, fed with commercial rodent chow (Koffolk Inc.) and
provided with tap water ad libitum. All animal experiments involving SARS-CoV-2
were conducted in a BSL3 facility.
Infection experiments were carried out using SARS-CoV-2, isolate Human 2019nCoV ex China strain BavPat1/2020 that was kindly provided by Prof. Dr. Christian
Drosten (Charité, Berlin, Germany) through the European Virus Archive – Global
(EVAg Ref-SKU: 026V-03883). The original viral isolate was amplified by 5
passages and quantified by plaque titration assay in Vero E6 cells, and stored at -80°C
until use. The viral stock DNA sequence and coding capacity were confirmed as
recently reported45.
SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1/2020 virus diluted in PBS supplemented with 2% FBS
(Biological Industries, Israel) was used to infect animals by intranasal instillation of
anesthetized mice. For Abs protection evaluation, mice were treated with two doses (4
days apart) of 1 mg/mouse of MD65 Ab, first administered IP either 4 h prior, or 1-4
days post-infection with 200 PFU of SARS-CoV-2. Dose-dependency experiments
were performed by single administration of 1, 0.1 and 0.01 mg/mouse (equivalent of
50, 5, and 0.5 mg/Kg body weight, respectively) of the MD65 antibody 2 days
following infection with 300 PFU SARS-CoV-2. Control groups were administered
with PBS or isotype control Ab (anti ricin MH75 Ab) at the indicated times. Body
weight was monitored daily throughout the follow-up period post infection. Mice

were evaluated once a day for clinical signs of disease and dehydration. Euthanasia
was applied when the animals exhibited irreversible veterinary-evaluated disease
symptoms (rigidity, lack of any visible reaction to contact).

Pharmacokinetics
Pharmacokinetics was determined in male and female C57BL/6 mice following
administration of 0.2 mg MD65 IgG-YTE Ab either by intravenous (IV; n=4; 200 μl
of 1 mg/ml Ab) or intraperitoneal [IP; n=5; 1 ml of 0.2 mg/ml Ab] route. At different
time points, 5 μl blood samples were drawn from the tail vein, diluted 20-fold in PBS,
and centrifuged for 10 min at 500 g for the removal of red blood cells. Supernatant
plasma fractions were stored at -20°C until tested in ELISA for the Ab concentration
determination as described above. Average antibody concentration at each time point
was used for calculating the pharmacokinetic parameters using non-compartmental
analysis (PK solutions 2.0, Summit Research Services, USA).

Measurement of viral RNA by qRT-PCR
Viral load in lungs of SARS-CoV-2 infected mice (200 PFU) treated with the MD65
antibody, was quantified by qRT-PCR and by plaque assay (see above). Lungs were
grinded in 1.5 ml PBS and 200 µl were added to LBF lysis buffer. RNA was extracted
using RNAdvance Viral Kit on a Biomek i7 automated workstation (Beckman
Coulter, IN), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Each sample was eluted in 50
µl of RNase-free water. RT-PCR was performed using the SensiFASTTM Probe LoROX One-Step kit (Bioline, UK). Primers and probe sequences, targeting the SARSCoV-2 E gene, were based on the Berlin protocol published in the WHO

Results and Discussion
Reformatting and characterization of the MD65 antibody. The initial binding and
neutralization characterization of MD65 Ab were conducted following the expression
of this antibody as a single-chain human-Fc recombinant form (scFv-Fc)11. Here,
towards implementation of this antibody as a bona-fide therapeutic product
appropriate for human use, it was re-cloned and produced as a full recombinant IgG
molecule

of

the

IgG1/k

isotype

which

includes

the

triple

mutation

M252Y/S254T/T256E (YTE) in the Fc region. These modifications increase the
antibody affinity towards the human FcRn33 at acidic pH and thereby prolong its
serum half-life, a parameter that is essential for a high therapeutic value34-36.
Characterization of three versions of the MD65 Ab: scFv-Fc, IgG and IgG-YTE,
established that overall they are comparable with regard to their antigen-binding
performance (Fig. 1a) and that the IgG versions exhibit slightly favorable affinity
when compared to the scFv-Fc one (apparent KD of 0.7 nM versus 1.0 nM,
respectively). Similarly, the two MD65 IgG formats possess equivalent SARS CoV-2
neutralization potency in vitro (NT50 of 40 ng/ml) which is slightly better than that of
the scFv-Fc antibody (NT50 of 67 ng/ml; Fig. 1b). In addition, all three Ab versions
were shown to effectively prevent the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD to the
hACE2, again with favorable kinetics for the IgG formats (Fig. 1c). These slight
differences may indicate that there is a correlation between antibody affinity and
SARS CoV-2 neutralization. This aspect will be further clarified in future studies.

Time 0 represents the binding of the hACE2 to the antibody-RBD complex. The MD65 IgG
curve completely overlapped with and is therefore masked by the MD65 IgG-YTE.

Pharmacokinetics of MD65 IgG-YTE. A pre-requisite for achieving long
circulatory half-life of a given antibody in humans, is to improve its interaction with
the FcRn at low pH. We therefore verified that MD65 in its IgG-YTE format, as
anticipated, exhibits improved pharmacokinetic abilities compared to the WT IgG
format. Accordingly, the interactions of MD65 IgG and IgG-YTE with human FcRn,
at pH 6.0 were assessed by biolayer interferometry (BLI). As expected, the modified
antibody demonstrated a marked increase in affinity compared to the non-modified
version, manifested by a three-fold improved on-rate and significant lower off-rate of
binding (Fig. 2a and b). Steady-state analysis of these interactions revealed that the
overall affinity of the IgG-YTE version toward human FcRn at low pH is 10-fold
higher than the IgG version (Fig. 2c).
As part of the pre-clinical evaluation of MD65 IgG-YTE antibody and prior to the
examination of its therapeutic potency, the pharmacokinetic profiles following
intravenous (IV; Fig. 2d) or intraperitoneal (IP; Fig. 2e) administration were
determined. Accordingly, MD65 IgG-YTE was first intravenously injected to
C57BL/6 mice and plasma antibody levels at various time points were determined by

ELISA. The data were fitted by non-compartmental analysis, establishing that MD65
IgG-YTE exhibits a biphasic elimination profile (Fig. 2d), consisting of a typical
relatively short distribution phase (α) with a t1⁄2 value of about 180 min and a

significantly longer elimination phase (β) with a t1⁄2 value of about 4,700 min (3.3
days; Fig. 2f). These results are in good agreement with our previous observation that
a chimeric protein bearing the same Fc (non YTE) exhibited similar pharmacokinetic
parameters in mice37, corroborating the notion that these mutations do not affect the
antibody interaction with the murine FcRn.
The plasma levels of MD65 IgG-YTE following IP administration was then
evaluated. The antibody exhibited a rapid and high bioavailability, reaching Cmax of
40 μg/ml within 180 min (Fig. 2e), a concentration which is commensurate to that
measured in the sera at the same time point following IV-administration (49 μg/ml,
Fig. 2d). The elimination phase t1⁄2 value following IP administration was
approximately 5300 min (3.7 days; Fig. 2f). Therefore, the pharmacokinetic
evaluation of the two alternative routes of administration indicate that they both are
appropriate for the subsequent protection studies.

Protection against SARS-CoV-2 lethal infection in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice.
To directly assess the use of the MD65 antibody as the basis for pre- and postexposure therapy to countermeasure the SARS-CoV-2 infection, the K18-hACE2
transgenic murine model (derived from the C57BL/6 strain), was employed for in vivo
neutralizing studies. This model was recently shown to fatefully recapitulate the
SARS-CoV-2 infection and consequently to serve as a reliable model to predict the
efficacy of therapeutic strategies18,26 27,38.
Infection of K18-hACE2 mice with 200 PFU of the SARS-CoV-2 BavPat1/2020
strain, resulted in significant weight loss from day 5 after infection and death of 80%
of the animals by day 9 post infection (Fig. 3). Of note, experiments were conducted
both with male and female mice establishing that no sex-dependent significant
differences in weight loss or mortality occurred (as exemplified in Supplementary Fig.
1) and in line with previous observations29.
In order to maintain a steady antibody levels in the circulation for about 8 days
(commensurate with the 7.5 days mean time to death (MTTD) in the control group),
and taking into consideration the pharmacokinetic profile, the antibody was
administered via the IP route in two successive treatments, 4 days apart. In sharp
contrast to mock-treated mice (administered with PBS only), pre-exposure IPadministration of the MD65 antibody 4 h before infection (first dose) resulted in full
protection of the infected animals without any signs of weight loss (Fig. 3a-c) or any
other clinical symptoms. The high lethality of the infection could not be alleviated in
mice administered with an isotype antibody control (MH75) that contains the same Fc
but targets a non-relevant antigen (ricin)39.
The successful pre-exposure treatment of the infected mice prompted us to further
evaluate the possibility to initiate treatment at even later time-points. K18-hACE2
mice were therefore infected with SARS-CoV-2 and IP-administered (first dose) with
the MD65 antibody 1, 2, 3 or 4 days post-infection (dpi). It was found that treatment
of infected mice initiated as late as 2 days after infection, was highly efficient in
blocking the disease, as demonstrated by the complete prevention of weight loss and,
most notably, by total protection of the mice (Fig. 3d-f). Furthermore, even when
treatment was initiated 3 dpi, all treated animals survived. Yet, mice in this
experimental group displayed some mild symptoms as manifested by a moderate and
transient body-weight loss. Even by further delaying the treatment to 4 dpi, a

protection rate of 60% of the infected animals was observed, yet, without a significant
delay in the time to death (for the 40% non-surviving animals). The surviving animals
in this group regained their initial body weight (Fig. 3e), indicative of efficient
recovery.
Taken together, these results demonstrate, for the first time, the therapeutic value of
human monoclonal antibodies as a life-saving treatment of severe and lethal COVID19 infection model.

results were combined from several experiments in which each group included at least 4
animals.

SARS-CoV-2 viral load in lungs collected from infected K18-hACE2 mice. The
efficiency of the treatment with the MD65 was further established by directly
interrogating the viral pulmonary load in infected mice, treated with the antibody 2
dpi (Fig. 4). The lungs were collected 6 dpi (the latest timepoint before onset of
mortality) and subjected to qRT-PCR for quantification of the viral burden. The qRTPCR data indicate that in the control non-treated group, as expected, the SARS CoV-2
virus propagated and reached a very high concentration (Fig. 4a), while antibody
treatment resulted in a viral load at least one order of magnitude lower (p<0.05).
We further evaluated the infectivity of the virus in the lung by testing its ability to
infect VERO E6 cells and to form plaques. As expected, the virus that was isolated
from the control group was viable and highly infective (Fig. 4b). However, no
infective virus could be isolated from the lungs of the antibody-treated mice (Fig. 4b
and Supplementary Fig. 2) establishing that MD65 treatment results in rapid and
complete resolution of infection, in agreement with prevention of animal death. This
latter finding also suggests that the viral load detected by PCR represents viral debris
genomes present in the lungs and not bona-fide infective virions.

Lung histopathological evaluation of antibody-treated K18-hACE2 mice. SARS
CoV-2 infection of K18-hACE2 mice is manifested by a progressive and widespread
viral pneumonia with perivascular and pan-alveolar inflammation, immune cell
infiltration, edema, lung consolidation and distinctive vascular system injury that were
apparent even three-weeks after infection (in surviving animals)26,29,40. Here, the
observation that post-exposure antibody-based treatment of infected mice resulted in
complete protection with no apparent signs of disease has prompted characterization
of the pathological status of their lungs. To this end, mice were infected with SARS
CoV-2, treated with MD65 two days later and necropsy was performed at day 21.
Overall, no major pathological changes or signs of inflammation were found in the
lungs of the antibody-treated mice (Fig. 4c, d and supplementary Fig. 3). The only
indication of previous-viral infection is the presence of scarce lymphoid aggregates
which are well contained (Fig. 4d). It was previously reported that in the course of
SARS CoV-2 infection in the K18-hACE2 model, B-cells infiltrated into the lungs,

accumulated and formed aggregates 29. It is therefore conceivable to assume that the
lymphoid aggregates observed here contain B-cells that were recruited during the
initial accumulation of the virus in the lungs, within the first days after infection.
Thus, the effective antibody-treatment that inhibited the virus ability to propagate
have also prevented the progression of the inflammatory process, as strongly
suggested by the infrequent occurrence of pathological changes in the lung and the
alveolar tissue. These results substantiate the notion that post-exposure antibodytreatment of lethal SARS CoV-2 infection is highly effective, rapidly neutralizes the
virus propagation and limits the inflammatory and the pathological progression.

Anti SARS CoV-2 seroconversion in antibody-treated animals. Antibodies against
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were reported to be detected as early as 7 days post
infection of K18-hACE2 mice29. It was previously shown that also following passive
immunization (against other infections), surviving animals seroconverted by
developing antigen-specific antibodies, which contributed to protection against reinfection41. Furthermore, in the context of the current pandemic, since the re-infection
by SARS-CoV-2 is a tangible possibility, it was of interest to determine whether the
MD65-treated mice developed an endogenous immune response toward the virus.
To this objective, the mouse humoral immune response towards SARS-CoV-2 Spike
glycoprotein was measured in treated mice at 14 dpi (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the
prophylactic administration of the MD65 Ab prevented the mounting of the humoral
response, suggesting that effective neutralization of the virus occurred immediately
upon infection (Fig. 5a). In contrast, animals treated either 1- or 2-days post-infection
developed a marked antibody response that is in good correlation with the time of
treatment. As several studies have shown that most SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing
antibodies target the S1 subunit and even more specifically the RBD, the humoral
responses of the antibody-treated mice toward these two antigens was further
evaluated. Indeed, a similar pattern was observed for these two antigens as for the
spike (Fig. 5b and 5c), suggesting that the endogenous antibody response may contain
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies that will confer partial or full protection against
re-infection. Determination of the neutralization titer of these samples could provide
further support for this concept, yet such an experiment is complicated by the masking
effect of residual MD65 Ab.

Fig. 5 Endogenous anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral response of infected K18-hACE2 mice
treated with the MD65 antibody. Sera samples were collected at day 14 post-infection from
mice treated with MD65 at the indicated timepoints and tested by ELISA for the presence of
endogenous (murine) antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 antigens: (a) spike, (b) S1 or (c)
RBD. Data represent individual and mean ±SEM (n=5 mice) of measurements obtained for
sera samples at 1:60 dilution. Horizontal bars indicate statistical significance of paired values.

Dose-dependent therapeutic efficacy of MD65. The ability of MD65 to protect
K18-hACE2 mice from SARS-CoV-2 infection at lower single doses was further
evaluated. To this end, single treatments of either 1, 0.1 and 0.01 mg Ab/animal were
administered at day 2 post virus infection. Body weight loss or mortality were not
detected in any of the animals treated with doses of 1 or 0.1 mg MD65 (Fig. 6).
Conversely, no significant protection was attained by treating animals with the low
0.01 mg MD65 dose. In the latter case, 80% of the mice, exhibited massive weight
lost and succumbed to the infection. Yet, it should be noted that this dose of antibody
induced a marked delay in the time to death (range 12-14 days with MTTD of 12.5
days) when compared to the control mice (range 7-10 days with MTTD of 8 days).
In conclusion, the dose-dependency experiments established that administration of
MD65 as late as 2 dpi, at a dose as low as 0.1 mg/mouse (representing 5 mg/kg body
weight) is therapeutically efficient. Furthermore, a therapeutically-relevant delay in
MTTD is promoted even at a 10-times lower dose.

mortality. In case of the mice treated with 0.01 mg MD65, the weight of the surviving animal

Antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection was documented for several
viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), measles as well as for corona
viruses42. This phenomenon is usually associated with the enhancement of virus
uptake by phagocytic cells or by the formation of immune complexes that lead to

excessive inflammatory responses. Post-exposure treatment of infected animals,
where the possibility for the formation of immune-complexes is higher, was proposed
as one of the tests for possible ADE effects in general and of SARS CoV-2 in
particular42. As of today, ADE was not reported for the current pandemic, yet there is
a need to continue monitoring for such effect43. In the current study, no worsened
effect (in terms of mortality, body weight loss as well as increased viral burden in the
lungs) in the antibody treated animals was observed, in spite of the high sensitivity of
the K18-hACE2 model which could have detected with ease such an occurrence.
To conclude, the data presented in this report demonstrates for the first time, to the
best of our knowledge, high-effective post-exposure therapy of SARS-CoV-2 lethal
infection in an animal model using a fully human monoclonal antibody. From the
clinical point of view, the efficacy of this antibody extends the therapeutic window
permitting initiation of life-saving treatment at late stages post-infection. This study
incents the development of a clinical product based on the MD65 antibody for human
use.
