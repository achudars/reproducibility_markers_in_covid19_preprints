ABSTRACT

19

Coronavirus E protein is a small membrane protein found in the virus envelope.

20

Different coronavirus E proteins share striking biochemical and functional

21

similarities, but sequence conservation is limited. In this report, we studied the E

22

protein topology from the new SARS-CoV-2 virus both in microsomal membranes

23

and in mammalian cells. Experimental data reveal that E protein is a single-spanning

24

membrane protein with the N-terminus being translocated across the membrane,

25

while the C-terminus is exposed to the cytoplasmic side (Ntlum/Ctcyt). The defined

26

membrane protein topology of SARS-CoV-2 E protein may provide a useful

27

framework to understand its interaction with other viral and host components and

28

establish the basis to tackle the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.

INTRODUCTION

33

The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), an extremely infectious human disease

34

caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has spread around the world at an

35

unprecedented rate, causing a worldwide pandemic. While the number of confirmed

36

cases continues to grow rapidly, the molecular mechanisms behind the biogenesis

37

of viral proteins are not fully unraveled. The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes for up

38

to 29 proteins, although some may not get expressed [1]. The viral RNA is packaged

39

by the structural proteins to assemble viral particles at the ERGIC (ER-Golgi

40

intermediate compartment). The four major structural proteins are the spike (S)

41

surface glycoprotein, the membrane (M) matrix protein, the nucleocapsid (N) protein,

42

and the envelope (E) protein. These conserved structural proteins are synthesized

43

from sub-genomic RNAs (sgRNA) encoded close to the 3’ end of the viral genome

44

[2].

45

Among the four major structural proteins, the E protein is the smallest and

46

has the lowest copy number of the membrane proteins found in the lipid envelope of

47

mature virus particles (reviewed [3,4]). However, it is critical for pathogenesis of other

48

human coronaviruses [5,6]. Interestingly, the sgRNA encoding E protein is one of the

49

most abundantly expressed transcripts despite the protein being low copy number

50

in mature viruses [1]. It encodes a 75 residues long polypeptide with a predicted

51

molecular weight of ~8 kDa. Two aliphatic amino acids (Leu and Val) constitute a

52

substantial portion (36%, 27/75) of the E protein, which accounts for the high grand

53

average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) index of the protein (1.128), as calculated using

54

the ExPASy ProtParam tool (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/). Comparative

55

sequence analysis of the E protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the other six known human

56

coronaviruses, do not reveal any large homologous/identical regions (Figure 1), with

57

only the initial methionine, Leu39, Cys40 and, Pro54 being ubiquitously conserved.

58

With regard to overall sequence similarity SARS-CoV-2 E protein has the highest

59

similarity to SARS-CoV (94.74%) with only minor differences (Figure 1B), and the

60

lowest with HCOV-NL63 (18.46%). These findings are consistent with the

61

phylogenetic tree proposed based on the amino acid sequences of the human

62

coronavirus E proteins using ClustalW (Figure 1C).

63
64

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

65

Computer-assisted analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein amino acid sequence

66

using seven popular prediction methods showed that all membrane protein

67

prediction algorithms except MEMSAT-SVM suggested the presence of one

68

transmembrane (TM) segment located roughly around amino acids 12 to 39 (Table

69

1), which is not predicted as a cleavable signal sequence according to SignalP-5.0

70

[7]. Regarding E protein topology, TMHMM and Phobius predicted an N-terminus

71

cytosolic orientation, whilst MEMSAT-SVM, TMpred, HMMTop and TOPCONS

72

predicted an N-terminus luminal orientation. Firstly, we performed in vitro E protein

73

transcription/translation experiments in the presence of ER-derived microsomes and

74

[35S]-labeled amino acids. The membrane insertion orientation of the predicted TM

75

segment into microsomal membranes was based on N-linked glycosylation and

76

summarized in Figure 2 (top).

77

N-linked glycosylation has been extensively used as topological reporter for

78

more than two decades [8]. In eukaryotic cells, proteins can only be glycosylated in

79

the lumen of the ER because the active site of oligosaccharyl transferase, a

80

translocon-associated protein responsible for N glycosylation [9], is located there

81

[10]; no N-linked glycosylation occurs within the membrane or in the cytosol. It is
4

82

important to note that two possible N-linked glycosylation sites are located C-

83

terminally of the predicted TM segment in E protein wild-type sequence at positions

84

N48 and N66 (Figure 1). However, N48 is not expected to be modified even if

85

situated lumenally due to the close proximity of this glycosylation acceptor site to the

86

membrane if the hydrophobic region is recognized as TM by the translocon [11,12].

87

Thus, mono-glycosylation (at N66) would serves as a C-terminal translocation

88

reporter. To test N-terminal translocation a construct was engineered where a

89

predicted highly efficient glycosylation acceptor site (NST) was designed at the N-

90

terminus. When E protein constructs were translated in vitro in the presence of

91

microsomes the protein was significantly glycosylated when the N-terminal designed

92

glycosylation site was present, as shown by the increase in the electrophoretic

93

mobility of the slower radioactive band after an endoglycosidase H (Endo H)

94

treatment (Figure 2, lanes 1 and 2). However, when a control (QST) that is not a

95

glycosylation acceptor site (lane 3) or the wild-type (lane 4) sequences were

96

translated, E protein molecules were minimally glycosylated. Since multiple

97

topologies have been reported for previous coronavirus E proteins [13-17], SARS-

98

CoV-2 E protein insertion into the microsomal membranes in two opposite

99

orientations cannot be discarded, but being dominant an Ntlum/Ctcyt orientation.

100

To analyse protein topology in mammalian cells, a series of E protein variants

101

tagged with c-myc epitope at the C-terminus were transfected into HEK-293T cells.

102

As shown in Figure 3A, only an E protein construct harbouring the N-terminal

103

engineered acceptor site was efficiently modified (lanes 1-4), denoting an N-terminal

104

ER luminal localisation (Ntlum). Several topological parameters have been proposed

105

to govern membrane protein topology, among them the preferential distribution of

106

positively charged residues in the cytosol (‘positive-inside rule’) has been

5

107

established as the primary topology determinant both experimentally [18] and

108

statistically [19]. E protein is a single-spanning membrane protein with an even net

109

charge distribution on both sides of the membrane. There are only eight charged

110

residues along the protein sequence, two negatively charged residues preceding the

111

TM segment and five positively and one negatively charged residues at the C-

112

terminal domain (Fig. 1A), that nicely correlates the observed topology with the

113

‘positive-inside rule’. However, negatively charged residues have also been proved

114

to significantly affect the topology [20]. To test the robustness of the observed

115

topology, we added an optimized Ct glycosylation tag [21] and replaced the two

116

negatively charged residues located in the translocated N-terminal domain (E7 and

117

E8) by two lysine residues (Fig. 3B). In cells expressing this mutant E protein

118

(EE>KK), the protein retained its C-terminal tail at the cytosolic side of the membrane

119

as indicated by the absence of glycosylated forms (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4). These

120

data reveal that topological determinants have only a minor effect on viral membrane

121

protein topology as previously demonstrated for other viruses [22], and suggest that

122

viral membrane protein topology could have co-evolved with the protein environment

123

of its natural host, ensuring proper membrane protein orientation. Altogether, the

124

present in vivo results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 E protein is a single-spanning

125

membrane protein with an Ntlum/Ctcyt orientation in mammalian cell membranes.

126

Similarly, SARS-CoV E protein was shown to mainly adopt an Ntlum/Ctcyt topology in

127

infected and transiently expressing mammalian cells [23]. This topology is

128

compatible with the ion channel capacity described previously [24], and with the

129

recently published pentameric structural model of SARS-CoV E protein in micelles

130

[25], in which the C-terminal tail of the protein is α-helical and extramembrane.

131

The membrane topology described here, would allow the cytoplasmic C-

132

terminal tail of the E protein to interact with the C-termini of M and/or S SARS-CoV-

133

2 membrane embedded proteins [3], and/or with Golgi scaffold proteins as previously

134

described for other coronaviruses [26], to induce virus budding or influence vesicular

135

traffic through the Golgi complex by collecting viral membrane proteins for assembly

136

at Golgi membranes. Future experiments will have to unravel whether these

137

functions involve the SARS-CoV-2 E-protein.

DNA Manipulation. Full-length E protein was synthesized by Invitrogen (GeneArt

158

gene synthesis) and subcloned into KpnI linearized pCAGGS using In-Fusion HD

159

cloning Kit (Takara) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For in vitro assays,

160

DNA was amplified by PCR adding the T7 promoter and the relevant glycosylation

161

sites during the process. N-terminal NST glycosylation site was designed by

162

inserting an asparagine and a threonine before and after Ser3, respectively. Control

163

no-glycosylable QST site was introduced in similarly inserting a glutamine residue

164

instead of an asparagine. All E protein variants were obtained by site-directed

165

mutagenesis using QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, California) and were

166

confirmed by sequencing the plasmid DNA at Macrogen Company (Seoul, South

171

The reactions contained 10 µL of TNT, 2 µL of PCR product, 1 µL of EasyTag (5

172

µCi), and 0.6 µL of column-washed microsomes (tRNA Probes, USA) and were

173

incubated for 60 min at 30 °C. Translation products were ultracentrifuged (100,000

174

g for 15 min) on a 0.5 M sucrose cushion, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For the

175

endoglycosidase H (Endo H) the treatment was done as previously described [34].

176

Briefly, the translation mixture was diluted in 120 µL of PBS and centrifuged on a 0.5

177

M sucrose cushion (100 000 × g 15 min 4 °C). The pellet was then suspended in 50

178

E protein expression in mammalian cells. E protein sequence variants were

182

tagged with an optimized C-terminal glycosylation site [21,35] plus a c-myc epitope

at their C-terminus and inserted in a pCAGGS-ampicillin plasmid. Once the

184

sequence was verified, plasmids were transfected into HEK293-T cells using

185

Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

186

Approximately 24 h post-transfection cells were harvested and washed with PBS

buffer. After a short centrifugation (1000 rpm for 5 min on a table-top centrifuge) cells

188

were lysed by adding 100 μL of lysis buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5%

189

Nonidet P-40) were sonicated in an ice bath in a bioruptor (Diagenode) during 10min

190

and centrifugated. Total protein was quantified and equal amounts of protein

191

submitted to Endo H treatment or mock-treated, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis
