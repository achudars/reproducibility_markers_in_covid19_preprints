Abstract

47

manage − viral diseases. They hold similar potential to advance COVID-19 control and

48

prevention, but SARS-CoV-2 viral load tests are not yet widely available. SARS-CoV-2

49

molecular diagnostic tests, which typically employ real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase

50

chain reaction (RT-PCR), yield semi-quantitative results only. Reverse transcriptase droplet

51

digital PCR (RT-ddPCR), a technology that partitions each reaction into 20,000 nanolitre-sized

52

droplets prior to amplification, offers an attractive platform for SARS-CoV-2 RNA

53

quantification. We evaluated eight primer/probe sets originally developed for real-time RT-PCR-

54

based SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests for use in RT-ddPCR, and identified three (Charité-Berlin

55

E-Sarbeco and Pasteur Institute IP2 and IP4) as the most efficient, precise and sensitive for RT-

56

ddPCR-based SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification. Analytical efficiency of the E-Sarbeco

57

primer/probe set, for example, was ~83%, while assay precision, as measured by the coefficient

58

of variation, was ~2% at 1000 input copies/reaction. Lower limits of quantification and detection

59

for this primer/probe set were 18.6 and 4.4 input SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/reaction,

60

respectively. SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral loads in a convenience panel of 48 COVID-19-positive

61

diagnostic specimens spanned a 6.2log10 range, confirming substantial viral load variation in

62

vivo. We further calibrated RT-ddPCR-derived SARS-CoV-2 E gene copy numbers against cycle

63

threshold (Ct) values from a commercial real-time RT-PCR diagnostic platform. The resulting

64

log-linear relationship can be used to mathematically derive SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers

65

from Ct values, allowing the wealth of available diagnostic test data to be harnessed to address

66

foundational questions in SARS-CoV-2 biology.

Introduction

72

6). While not yet widely available for SARS-CoV-2, quantitative assays could advance our

73

understanding of COVID-19 biology and inform infection prevention and control measures (7,

74

8). Most SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic assays however, which use real-time reverse

75

transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) to detect one or more SARS-CoV-2 genomic targets using

76

sequence-specific primers coupled with a fluorescent probe, are only semi-quantitative. These

77

tests produce cycle threshold (Ct) values as readouts, which represent the PCR cycle where the

78

sample began to produce fluorescent signal above background. While each Ct value decrement

79

corresponds to a roughly two-fold higher viral load (due to the exponential nature of PCR

80

amplification), Ct values cannot be directly interpreted as SARS-CoV-2 viral loads without

81

calibration to a quantitative standard (9). Rather, Ct values are interpreted as positive,

82

indeterminate or negative based on assay-specific cutoffs and evolving clinical guidelines. Due

83

to differences in nucleic acid extraction method, viral target and other parameters, Ct values are

84

also not directly comparable across assays or technology platforms.

85

Quantitative viral load assays have revolutionized our ability to manage viral diseases (1-

Reverse transcriptase droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) offers an attractive platform for

86

SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification (10, 11). Like real-time RT-PCR, ddPCR employs target-

87

specific primers coupled with a fluorescent probe, making it relatively straightforward to adapt

88

assays. In ddPCR however, each reaction is fractionated into 20,000 nanolitre-sized droplets

89

prior to massively parallel PCR amplification. At end-point, each droplet is categorized as

90

positive (target present) or negative (target absent), allowing for absolute target quantification

91

using Poisson statistics. This sensitive and versatile technology has been used for mutation

92

detection and copy number determination in the human genome (12), target verification

following genome editing (13), and copy number quantification for viral pathogens (14-19).

94

Several real-time RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2-specific primer/probe sets have been used in RT-

95

ddPCR (10, 11, 20-22) with results achieving high sensitivity in some reports (11, 21, 23-25), but

96

few studies have rigorously evaluated SARS-CoV-2-specific primer/probe set performance in

97

RT-ddPCR using RNA as a template. Furthermore, no studies to our knowledge have calibrated

98

SARS-CoV-2 viral loads to diagnostic test Ct values. Here, we evaluate eight SARS-CoV-2-

99

specific primer/probe sets originally developed for real-time RT-PCR (26), for use in RT-

100

ddPCR. We also derive a linear equation relating RT-ddPCR-derived SARS-CoV-2 viral loads

101

and real-time RT-PCR-derived Ct values for a commercial diagnostic assay, the LightMix®

102

Modular SARS-CoV (COVID19) E-gene assay, allowing conversion of existing COVID-19

103

diagnostic results to viral loads.

Materials and Methods
Primer and Probe Sets
Eight SARS-CoV-2-specific primer/probe sets developed for real-time RT-PCR COVID-

108

19 diagnostic assays (26) were assessed for use in RT-ddPCR (Table 1). These included the

109

Charité-Berlin E gene (‘E-Sarbeco’) set (27), the Pasteur Institute RdRp IP2 and IP4 sets (‘IP2’

110

and ‘IP4’, respectively) (28), the Chinese Centre for Disease Control ORF and N gene sets

111

(‘China-ORF’ and ‘China-N’, respectively) (29), the Hong Kong University ORF and N gene

112

sets (‘HKU-ORF’ and ‘HKU-N’, respectively) (30), and the US-CDC-N1 set (31).

113

SARS-CoV-2 Synthetic RNA standards

114

RT-ddPCR assays were evaluated using commercial synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA

115

standards comprising six non-overlapping 5,000 base fragments of equal quantities encoding the

116

Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 genome (Control 2, Genbank ID MN908947.3; Twist Biosciences,

117

supplied at approximately 1 million copies/fragment/µl). To avoid degradation, RNA standards

118

were stored at -80°C and thawed only once, immediately before use, to perform the analytical

119

efficiency, precision, analytical sensitivity and dynamic range analyses described herein.

120

Moreover, to mimic nucleic acid composition of a real biological specimen, all assays employing

121

these standards were supplemented with a consistent, physiologically relevant amount of nucleic

122

acid extracted from pooled remnant SARS-CoV-2-negative nasopharyngeal swabs

123

(Supplementary Figure 1). Briefly, pooled viral transport medium was extracted in 1ml aliquots

124

on the BioMerieux NucliSens® EasyMag®, eluted in 60µl and re-pooled. The resulting material

125

contained DNA from on average 2,200 human cells/µl (as quantified using human RPP30 DNA

126

Thermal cycling temperature optimization

141

RT-ddPCR reactions were performed by combining relevant SARS-CoV-2 RNA

For each primer/probe set, acceptable thermal cycling temperature ranges for reverse

142

transcription (RT) and PCR annealing/extension were determined by modifying the

143

manufacturer-recommended default conditions, which are 42-50°C for 1 hour (for reverse

144

transcription); 95°C for 10 minutes; 40 cycles of (94°C for 30 seconds followed by 50-63°C for

145

1 minute); 98°C for 10 minutes and 4°C infinite hold. To determine acceptable temperature

146

ranges for reverse transcription, a thermal gradient from 42-51.5°C was performed while fixing

147

the annealing/extension step at 52°C. Using the optimized reverse transcription temperature, a

148

thermal gradient from 50-63°C was then performed to identify acceptable annealing/extension

149

temperature ranges. Temperatures that produced insufficient separation of positive from negative

150

droplets or non-specific amplification were deemed unacceptable, as were those that produced

point-estimate.

153

Analytical Efficiency and Precision

154

The analytical efficiency of each primer/probe set to quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-

155

ddPCR was determined using synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards at 1000 and 100 input

156

copies. A minimum of three (maximum four) technical replicates were performed at each

157

concentration. Analytical efficiency was calculated by dividing the measured SARS-CoV-2 copy

158

number by the expected input copy number, and multiplying by 100. Precision was expressed as

159

the coefficient of variation (CV), expressed as a percentage, across technical replicates.

160

Linear Dynamic Range

161

The linear dynamic range (LDR) of each primer/probe set of interest was determined

162

across a serial 1:2 dilution series from 114,286 to 1.2 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/reaction. This

163

range of concentrations was chosen as it crosses the entire range of recommended input copies

164

for a ddPCR reaction seeking to quantify the target of interest (34). Reactions were performed in

165

duplicate. The upper and lower limits of quantification of (ULOQ and LLOQ, respectively) were

166

defined as the upper and lower boundaries of the concentration range over which the relationship

167

between measured and input SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies was linear. This was determined by

168

iteratively restricting the range of concentrations included in the linear regression of measured

169

versus input SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies to identify that which maximized the coefficient of

170

determination (R2) value and minimized the residuals.

171

Assay Analytical Sensitivity

173

Assay analytical sensitivity, defined as the Lower Limit of Detection (LLOD), was
determined for primer/probe sets of interest by serially diluting synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA

174

standards to between 47.6 and 0.74 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/reaction. Between 6 and 18

175

technical replicates were performed for each dilution and results were analyzed using probit

176

regression. The LLOD, determined through interpolation of the probit curve, was defined as the

177

concentration of input SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a reaction where the probability of detection was

178

95%.

179

SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification in biological specimens, and relationship to Ct value

180

Optimized RT-ddPCR assays were applied to a convenience sample of 48 consecutive

181

remnant SARS-CoV-2-positive diagnostic nasopharyngeal swab specimens that were originally

182

submitted to the St. Paul’s Hospital Virology Laboratory in Vancouver, Canada for diagnostic

183

testing using the Roche cobas® SARS-CoV-2 assay. For these samples, total nucleic acids were

184

re-extracted from 250µl remnant media using the BioMerieux NucliSens® EasyMag® and

185

eluted in 50µl. Eluates were aliquoted and frozen at -80°C prior to single use. SARS-CoV-2 copy

186

numbers were quantified by RT-ddPCR as described above. As our main goal was to

187

characterize the relationship between Ct values and SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels without

188

confounding by extraction platform, quantity of input material or SARS-CoV-2 genomic target,

189

we re-tested these extracts using a commercial real-time RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assay

190

that uses the E-Sarbeco primer/probe set (27): the LightMix® 2019-nCoV real-time RT-PCR

191

assay E-gene target (Tib-Molbiol), implemented on LightCycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics).

192

Finally, to be responsive to a recent recommendation that SARS-CoV-2 viral loads be reported

193

in terms of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per human cell equivalents (9), we measured human

194

cells/µl extract by ddPCR as previously described (32) and additionally reported results as

195

SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/1,000 human cells.

Results

204

Thermal cycling optimization for SARS-CoV-2 quantification by RT-ddPCR

205

Eight primer/probe sets originally developed for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing by real

206

time RT-PCR were evaluated for use in RT-ddPCR (Table 1). As these primer/probe sets vary in

207

sequence, amplicon length and SARS-CoV-2 genomic target, we first determined the acceptable

208

temperature ranges for reverse transcription (RT) and PCR annealing/extension. Most

209

primer/probe sets were tolerant to a wide temperature range, and background signal was

210

essentially zero at all temperatures tested (Figure 1). The E-Sarbeco primer/probe set for

211

example produced consistent amplitude profiles, copy number estimates and essentially zero

212

background at annealing/extension temperatures ranging from 50-63°C (Figure 1A and data not

213

shown). The HKU-ORF primer/probe performed acceptably over a 50-60.5°C

214

annealing/extension range, but positive and negative droplet separation was insufficient at higher

215

temperatures (Figure 1B). Acceptable temperature ranges for each primer/probe set are shown in

216

Figure 1C. All subsequent experiments were performed at RT 42.7°C and annealing/extension

217

50.9°C except those for HKU-ORF and US-CDC-N1, which were performed at RT 45.7°C and

218

annealing/extension 55.1°C as informed by initial qualitative assessments.

219

Analytical Efficiency and Precision of SARS-CoV-2 quantification by RT-ddPCR

220

We next evaluated the analytical efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification for each

221

primer/probe set, calculated as the percentage of input viral RNA copies detected by the assay.

222

We also evaluated precision, calculated as the dispersion of measured copies around the mean

223

(coefficient of variation, CV). Analytical efficiency and precision were evaluated at 1000 and

224

100 SARS-CoV-2 RNA target input copies. At 1000 input copies, primer/probe set analytical

225

efficiency ranged from 83% (E-Sarbeco) to 15% (US-CDC-N1) (Figure 2A). At 100 copies, the

10

226

analytical efficiency hierarchy was identical, with values ranging from 74% (E Sarbeco) to 12%

227

(US-CDC-N1). Of all primer/probe sets evaluated, the E-Sarbeco, IP2 and IP4 sets had the

228

highest analytical efficiencies by a substantial margin. At 1000 and 100 target copies, E-Sarbeco

229

analytical efficiency was 83% (95% Total Poisson Confidence Interval [CI]: 79- 87%) and 74%

230

(95% CI: 63- 84%), respectively; IP2, analytical efficiency was 70% (95% CI: 67- 73%) and

231

55% (95% CI: 46- 64%), respectively; and IP4 analytical efficiency was 69% (95% CI: 66- 72%)

232

and 59% (95% CI: 50-69%), respectively. In contrast, analytical efficiency of the China-ORF

233

primer/probe set was only 46% and 39% at 1000 and 100 input copies, respectively, and the

234

analytical efficiencies of the remaining sets were less than 30% regardless of input copy number.

235

Furthermore, while measurement precision generally decreased at the lower template

236

concentration (35), the E-Sarbeco, IP2 and IP4 primer/probe sets were nevertheless among the

237

most precise, with coefficients of variation (CV) of less than 5% at 1,000 input copies and less

238

than 15% at 100 input copies (Figure 2B). Combined analytical efficiency and precision data

239

confirmed E-Sarbeco, IP2 and IP4 as the best-performing primer/probe sets in RT-ddPCR

240

(Figures 2C and 2D), so these were moved forward for further characterization.

241

Reduced analytical efficiency when IP2 and IP4 are duplexed in RT-ddPCR

242

As IP2 and IP4 were originally designed for duplexing in real-time RT-PCR (28), we

243

evaluated them in duplex for RT-ddPCR. Duplexing however decreased analytical efficiency,

244

from 70% to 52% (at 1000 input copies) and 55% to 37% (at 100 input copies) for IP2, and from

245

69% to 49% (at 1000 input copies) and 59% to 38% (at 100 input copies) for IP4 (Supplemental

246

Figure 2A). Duplexing also decreased precision (Supplemental Figure 2B). For IP2, CV

247

increased from 5% to 11% when duplexing at 1000 input copies, and from 15% to 25% when

248

duplexing at 100 input copies. For IP4, CV increased from 4% to 7% (1000 input copies) and

249

from 14% to 21% (100 input copies) with duplexing. Duplexing of these reactions is therefore

250

not recommended in RT-ddPCR, and all IP2 and IP4 assays were performed as single reactions.

251

Linear Dynamic Range and Limits of Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-ddPCR

252

Droplet digital PCR can achieve absolute target copy number quantification without a

253

standard curve. To investigate the linear dynamic range (LDR) of quantification of the E-

254

Sarbeco, IP2 and IP4 assays, we set up 18 two-fold serial dilutions of synthetic SARS-CoV-2

255

RNA beginning at 114,286 copies/reaction (this copy number is obtained when 120,000 copies

256

are added to a 21µl reaction, of which 20µl is used for droplet generation) and ending with 2.32

257

copies/reaction. This input copy number range crosses nearly the entire manufacturer-

258

recommended template input range for ddPCR reactions seeking to quantify the target of interest,

259

which is 1- 100,000 copies/reaction (36).

260

The LDR of each assay was determined by iteratively restricting the range of

261

concentrations included in the linear regression of measured versus input SARS-CoV-2 RNA

262

copies to identify the range that maximized the R2 value and minimized the residuals. For E-

263

Sarbeco, the regression spanning 18.6-114,286 input SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per reaction, an

264

approximately 6,100-fold concentration range, yielded an R2 value of 0.9995 (Figure 3A, left).

265

Restricting the linear regression to this range also minimized the residuals of all included data

266

points to ±0.065log10 copies/reaction (Figure 3A, right). The IP2 assay, while less efficient than

267

E-Sarbeco, had the same estimated LDR of 18.6-114,286 input copies/reaction (Figure 3B, left).

268

This produced an R2 value of 0.9995 and residuals within ±0.065log10 copies/reaction across the

269

LDR (Figure 3B, right). The LDR of IP4 was estimated as 37.2- 114,286 input copies/reaction,

270

an approximately 3,000-fold range, which yielded an R2= 0.9975 and produced residuals within

271

±0.11log10 copies/reaction across this range (Figure 3C). For all three assays, 114,286 input

272

copies/reaction should be considered a conservative estimate of the upper limit of quantification,

273

as saturation of the RT-ddPCR reaction or loss of linearity was still not achieved at this

274

concentration.

275

Lower Limit of Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-ddPCR

276

We next determined the lower limit of detection (LLOD) of the E-Sarbeco, IP2 and IP4

277

RT-ddPCR assays (Figure 4). Probit regression analysis applied to serial dilutions of synthetic

278

SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards revealed the E-Sarbeco RT-ddPCR assay to be the most

279

analytically sensitive of the three, which is consistent with it also having the highest analytical

280

efficiency. Specifically, the estimated LLOD of the E-Sarbeco assay was 4.4 (95% Confidence

281

Interval [CI]: 2.4-5.7) SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/reaction (Figure 4A). The estimated LLOD of

282

the IP2 assay was 7.8 (95% CI: 4.4-10.3) SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/reaction (Figure 4B), while

283

that of IP4 was 12.6 (95% CI: 6.9-16.5) SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per reaction (Figure 4C).

284

SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in biological samples

285

SARS-CoV-2 viral loads were measured in 48 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive samples

286

using the E-Sarbeco, IP2 and IP4 primer/probe sets (note that samples with original diagnostic

287

test Ct values <19 required RNA extracts to be diluted up to 1:200 prior to quantification to

288

ensure that input copies measurements fell within each assay's LDR). The results revealed that

289

SARS-CoV-2 RNA in these biological samples varied over a 6.2 log10 range (Figure 5A).

290

Average copy numbers measured using the E-Sarbeco assay (which targets the E gene) were

291

higher than those using the IP2 and IP4 assays (which target ORF1a and ORF1b, respectively)

292

(Figure 5A). This is consistent with assay analytical efficiency (Figure 2) and in vivo coronavirus

293

RNA expression patterns, where transcripts covering the 3’ end of the genome are more

294

abundant than those covering the 5’ end (37-40). Specifically, the median E-gene copy number

13

295

was 5.1 (IQR 3.9- 5.7) log10copies/µl extract compared to a median of 4.9 (IQR 3.9- 5.5)

296

log10copies/µl extract for the IP2 target, and a median of 4.9 (IQR 3.9- 5.6) log10 copies/µl

297

extract for the IP4 target. SARS-CoV-2 E-gene, IP2 and IP4 copy numbers in biological samples

298

correlated strongly with one another (Spearman's ρ>0.99; p<0.0001 for all pairwise analyses;

299

Figure 5BCD). Consistent with comparable ORF1a and ORF1b RNA transcript levels in vivo

300

(37, 38, 40), IP2 and IP4 copy numbers were also highly concordant (Lin's concordance

301

correlation coefficient, ρc=0.9996 [95% CI: 0.9993- 0.9998]) (Figure 5D). Based on a recent

302

recommendation (9), we also report our results in terms of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per human

303

cell equivalents: results for E-Sarbeco spanned an 7-fold range from 1.05 to 7.3 log10SARS-

304

CoV-2 RNA copies/1,000 human cells, with IP2 and IP4 log10 copy numbers lower, as expected

305

(Supplemental Figure 3A). The Spearman's correlation between absolute and human cell-

306

normalized viral loads was strong (ρ=0.9717; p<0.0001; Supplementary Figure 3B), which is

307

consistent with the assumption that the amount of biological material collected by

308

nasopharyngeal swabs is relatively consistent.

309

Inferring SARS-CoV-2 viral loads from diagnostic Ct values

310

Finally, we characterized the relationship between Ct values produced by a commercial

311

COVID-19 diagnostic platform and SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers. We selected the

312

LightMix® 2019-nCoV real-time RT-PCR assay, E-gene target (Tib-Molbiol), implemented on a

313

LightCycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics) because commercial diagnostic reagents comprising the E-

314

Sarbeco primer/probe set exist for this platform (27) and because it takes purified nucleic acids

315

as input, thereby allowing direct comparison of results from the same starting material (real-time

316

RT-PCR platforms that take biological material as input are suboptimal for such a comparison

317

because the onboard extraction introduces an additional variable). As the Ct values reported for

14

318

the LightMix® assay are based on a 9µl extract input volume, our primary analysis reported RT-

319

ddPCR results in terms of SARS-CoV-2 copies equivalent (i.e. SARS-CoV-2 copies in 9µl of

320

extract), to allow direct conversion of Ct values to absolute viral copy numbers.

321

Sample Ct values ranged from 11.34-31.18 (median 18.69 [IQR 16.73- 22.69]) using the

322

LightMix® assay. The relationship between Ct value and SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy numbers was

323

log-linear, with an R2 = 0.9990 (Figure 6). Despite this strong relationship, inspection of the

324

residuals nevertheless suggested modest departures from log-linearity at the extremes of the

325

linear range (Supplementary Figure 4). The relationship between Ct value and absolute SARS-

326

CoV-2 E-gene copies can thus be given by log10SARS-CoV-2 E gene copies equivalent =

327

-0.3038Ct +11.7 (Figure 6). That is, a Ct value of 20 corresponds to 453,942 (i.e. 5.66 log10)

328

SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies, while a Ct value of 30 corresponds to 416 (i.e. 2.62 log10) viral

329

copies. This equation also predicts that the Ct values corresponding to the LLOQ and LLOD of

330

the E-Sarbeco RT-ddPCR assays are 34.8 and 36.84, respectively. When measured SARS-CoV-2

331

RNA copy numbers are expressed as human cell-normalized viral loads, the relationship with Ct

332

value is given by log10SARS-CoV-2 E gene copies/1,000 human cells = -0.3041Ct + 10.8

333

(Supplemental Figure 5). An extract that yielded a Ct value of 20 therefore is estimated to have

334

contained 48,978 (i.e. 4.69 log10) SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/1,000 human cells, while one with

335

Ct value of 30 is estimated to have contained 45 (i.e. 1.66 log10) copies/1,000 human cells

336
337

Discussion

338

While real-time and droplet digital RT-PCR platforms both employ target-specific

339

primers coupled with fluorescence-based amplicon detection, there are key differences in

340

reaction chemistry (e.g. RT-ddPCR reagents must be compatible with water-in-oil droplet

15

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.21.423898; this version posted December 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

341

partitioning) and probe chemistry (e.g. while real-time RT-PCR uses fluorescent quenchers,

342

ddPCR typically uses dark quenchers). As a result, assays developed for one platform may not

343

always translate seamlessly to the other. For example, ddPCR probes should ideally not have a

344

Guanine at their 5' end because this quenches the fluorescence signal even following hydrolysis

345

(36) but the HKU-N probe has a G at its 5' end (Table 1).

346

It is perhaps therefore not surprising that the overall performance of the eight

347

primer/probe sets in RT-ddPCR did not exactly mirror that in real-time RT-PCR (41, 42).

348

Nevertheless, E-Sarbeco, IP2 and IP4, which represented the most efficient and precise

349

primer/probe sets for SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification by RT-ddPCR are also among the most

350

efficient in real-time RT-PCR (41, 42). Our results also confirm previous reports of the E-

351

Sarbeco primer/probe set performing well in RT-ddPCR (10, 22). Other primer/probe sets

352

however, notably US CDC-N1, HKU-ORF and China-ORF, did not perform as well in our RT-

353

ddPCR assay compared to a previous report (10). One key difference is that, while we used

354

sequence-specific reverse transcription (with the reverse primer) in a one-step RT-ddPCR

355

reaction, the previous study featured an independent reverse transcription reaction primed with

356

random hexamers and oligo dT, which can yield higher efficiency than sequence-specific

357

priming (35, 43-45), to generate cDNA for input into a ddPCR reaction. To our knowledge, ours

358

is the first study to evaluate IP2 or IP4 primer/probe sets in RT-ddPCR.

359

The analytical sensitivities of the RT-ddPCR assays reported here are nevertheless

360

comparable to existing estimates. The limit of detection of the BioRad SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR Kit

361

(20) is, for example, estimated at 150 copies/mL, which is comparable to our E-Sarbeco RT-

362

ddPCR assay (estimated at 75.8 copies/mL assuming 100% extraction efficiency). Similarly, the

363

LLODs of the TargetingOne (Beijing, China) COVID-19 digital PCR detection kit (23) and a

16

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.21.423898; this version posted December 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

364

multiplex assay that included the E-Sarbeco primer/probe set (22) were reported at 10 copies/test

365

and 5 copies/reaction, respectively, both comparable to the LLOD determined here. While a

366

number of studies have reported that RT-ddPCR can detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in low viral load

367

clinical samples with higher sensitivity than real-time RT-PCR (11, 21, 23-25), our study was

368

not designed to evaluate this. Our estimated LLOD of 4.4 copies/reaction by RT-ddPCR using

369

the E-Sarbeco primer/probe set (Figure 4) is in fact comparable to the LLOD reported for many

370

real-time RT-PCR-based COVID-19 diagnostic assays (46).

371

The ability to quantify SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in biological samples can advance our

372

understanding of COVID-19 biology, and RT-ddPCR offers an attractive platform (7, 8). Our

373

observation that, in a small convenience sample, both absolute and human cell-normalized (9)

374

SARS-CoV-2 loads spanned a more than 6 log10 range confirms an enormous viral load range in

375

vivo (47) and suggests that some of the high viral load samples measured here were from

376

individuals with early and progressive infection (23, 48-50) or who were experiencing severe

377

disease (7, 8), though clinical information was unknown. Furthermore, our equation relating Ct

378

values derived from a commercial diagnostic assay and SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy number means

379

that existing diagnostic test results can be converted to viral loads without re-testing samples.

380

While calibration of viral load measurements against all real-time RT-PCR platforms is beyond

381

our scope, this is achievable and in some cases data may already be available (23).

382

Some limitations merit mention. We only tested eight commonly-used SARS-CoV-2-

383

specific primer/probe sets, and others may exist that adapt well to RT-ddPCR. Our assay

384

performance estimates should be considered approximate, as the manufacturer-reported

385

concentration of the synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards used in our study may vary by up to

386

20% error (Twist Bioscience, personal communication). Moreover, we solely evaluated a one-

17

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.21.423898; this version posted December 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

387

step RT-ddPCR protocol, and therefore assay performance estimates will likely differ from

388

protocols that feature independent cDNA generation followed by ddPCR. We could not precisely

389

define the upper boundary of the linear dynamic range of the E-Sarbeco, IP2 and IP4 RT-ddPCR

390

assays as linearity was maintained at the maximum input of 114,286 target copies/reaction,

391

which already exceeds the manufacturer's estimated upper range of quantification in a ddPCR

392

reaction (36). Our convenience panel of 48 SARS-CoV-2-positive diagnostic specimens also

393

likely did not capture the full range of biological variation in viral loads, though data from larger

394

cohorts (47) suggests that it was reasonably comprehensive. We also acknowledge that there is

395

measurement uncertainty with real-time RT-PCR Ct values that may subtly affect the linear

396

relationship between Ct value and RT-ddPCR-derived SARS-CoV-2 viral load described here.

397

Finally, our estimates of assay performance may not completely reflect those of the entire

398

diagnostic process, as the nucleic acid extraction step introduces additional inefficiencies.

399

In conclusion, primer/probe sets used in real-time RT-PCR-based COVID-19 diagnostic

400

tests can be migrated to RT-ddPCR to achieve SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification with varying

401

analytical efficiency, precision and sensitivity. Of the primer/probe sets tested, the E-Sarbeco,

402

IP2 and IP4 sets performed best, where LLOQ and LLOD estimates for the E-Sarbeco assay

403

(18.6 and 4.4 copies/reaction, respectively) indicated that RT-ddPCR and real-time RT-PCR

404

have comparable sensitivity. Mathematical inference of SARS-CoV-2 copy numbers from

405

COVID-19 diagnostic test Ct values, made possible via the type of calibration performed in the

406

present study, will allow the wealth of existing diagnostic test data to be harnessed to answer

407

foundational questions in SARS-CoV-2 biology.

Figure 1: Thermal cycling optimization (A). RT-ddPCR plots for annealing/extension under a
50-63°C thermal gradient for the E-Sarbeco primer/probe set. A representative RT-ddPCR plot
for a no template control (NTC) which only included non-target DNA/RNA (see methods) at the
temperature used in subsequent experiments, is also shown. Positive droplets (blue) are above
the threshold (pink line); negative droplets (grey) are below the line. Colored boxes below each
well indicate if results met standards for inclusion (green) or not (red) (see methods). (B). Same
as panel A, but for HKU-ORF primer/probe set. (C). Acceptable RT and annealing/extension

Figure 2: Analytical efficiency and precision of primer/probe sets. (A) Analytical efficiency
of each primer/probe set, calculated as the measured divided by the input SARS-CoV-2 RNA
copies multiplied by 100%, is shown for reactions containing 1,000 and 100 input copies of
synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Bars represent 95% Total Poisson Confidence Intervals. (B).
Precision of each primer/probe set, defined as the coefficient of variation (expressed as a

1,000 input SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies identifies E-Sarbeco, IP2 and IP4 primer/probe sets as
having analytical efficiencies >50% and CV (%) <15%. (D). Same as C, but for 100 input

E-Sarbeco, IP2 and IP4 primer/probe sets as having analytical efficiencies >50% and CV
(%) <15%. (D). Same as C, but for 100 input SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies.

assays. (A). left: log10Measured SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies over serial dilutions of
synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA standards ranging from 114,286 to 2.32 copies/reaction

(LLOQ) of the assay. Data points that yielded undetectable measurements are set
arbitrarily to -0.35log10Measured copies/reaction for visualization. right: Log10Residuals,
calculated as log10Measured SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/reaction minus log10Calulated

Figure 4: Lower Limit of Detection (LLOD) of the E-Sarbeco, IP2 and IP4 RTddPCR assays. (A). The probability of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA (%) in 1:2 in serial
dilutions of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 47.6 to 0.74 input copies/reaction using
the E-Sarbeco primer/probe set is analyzed using probit regression (solid black line;
dashed line denotes the 95% confidence interval). The LLOD, defined as the
concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a reaction where the probability of detection in
the assay was 95%, was interpolated from the standard curve and is shown as a colored
dashed line (B). Same as A, but for the IP2 primer/probe set (C). Same as A, but for the
IP4 primer/probe set.

test Ct value. Ct value, determined using the LightMix® 2019-nCoV real-time RT-PCR
assay (E-gene target) is plotted against log10SARS-CoV-2 E gene RNA copies
equivalent, which represents the number of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies measured by RTddPCR in 9µl extract (the template volume in the LightMix® assay). The linear

Supplementary Figure 1: All experiments using synthetic SARS-CoV-2 synthetic
standards were performed in a consistent background of human nucleic acids to
mimic a real human sample. Example experiment showing consistent levels of
background human cells/µl extract (determined by dividing measured human RPP30
DNA copy number by two; black triangles), and human RNAse P RNA levels (grey
squares) across a titration of SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA standards, measured using the
E-Sarbeco primer/probe set (green circles). Error bars indicate 95% Total Poisson
Confidence Intervals for two merged replicates, where in some cases error bars are too

analytical efficiency and precision. (A). Analytical efficiency of SARS-CoV-2
quantification was evaluated for the IP2 and IP4 primer/probe sets when used in separate
reactions (dark red and dark blue, respectively) and when duplexed (light red and light
blue, respectively), in reactions containing 1,000 and 100 viral RNA input copies. Error
bars represent 95% Total Poisson Confidence Intervals. (B). Same as A, but for assay
precision (coefficient of variation, CV%).
