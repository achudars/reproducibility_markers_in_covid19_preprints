Abstract
The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is known to bind to the receptor, ACE2, on the
surface of target cells. The spike protein is processed by membrane proteases,
including TMPRSS2, and either internalises or fuses directly with the cell, leading to
infection. We have identified a human cell line that expresses both ACE2 and
TMPRSS2, the RT4 urinary bladder transitional carcinoma, and used it to develop a
proxy assay for viral interactions with host cells. A tagged recombinant form of the
spike protein, containing both the S1 and S2 domains, interacted strongly with RT4
cells as determined by flow cytometry, whereas the S1 domain and the receptor
binding domain (RBD) interacted weakly. S1S2 interaction was temperature
dependent and increased sharply at 37°C, suggesting that processing of the intact
spike protein is likely to be important in the interaction. S1S2 protein could associate
with cells with a low dependence on ACE2 expression, while RBD required the
presence of ACE2 for interaction. As the spike protein has previously been shown to
bind heparin, a soluble glycosaminoglycan, we used a flow cytometric assay to
determine the effect of heparin on spike protein interaction with RT4 cells.
Unfractionated heparin inhibited spike protein interaction with an IC50 value of
<0.05U/ml whereas two low molecular weight heparins were much less effective. A
mutant form of the spike protein, lacking the Arg-rich region proposed to be a furin
cleavage site, interacted very weakly with cells and had a lower affinity for
unfractionated and lower molecular weight heparin than the wild type spike protein.
This indicates that the furin cleavage site might also be a heparin binding site and
potentially important in interactions with host cells. Taken together, our data suggest

that heparin, particularly unfractionated forms, could be considered to reduce clinical
manifestations of COVID-19 by inhibiting continuing viral infection.

Author Summary
Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, the world has faced a vast public
health crisis. SARS-CoV-2 associates with human cells through interaction of the
viral spike protein with the host receptor, ACE2. In the absence of a vaccine, new
treatments are required to reduce the morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2. Here,
we use a novel technique to demonstrate spike protein interactions with human cells
with low levels of ACE2 at the cell surface, suggesting a secondary receptor. We
demonstrate the importance of a new heparin-binding site within the viral spike
protein for these interactions. We also found that unfractionated heparin was able to
bind to the viral spike protein and therefore, potently inhibit viral spike protein
interactions with human cells. Our data demonstrate that ACE2 is not absolutely
required for spike protein interactions with human cells and furthermore, that
unfractionated heparin should be considered as a treatment to reduce SARS-CoV-2
viral infection.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is thought to infect cells after
binding with high affinity to a host cell receptor, ACE2 [1]. The ACE2 binding domain
is located in the spike protein that consists of two domains: S1, which has a high
affinity receptor binding domain (RBD) and S2, containing sequences necessary for
fusion with the host cell. S1 and S2 are linked by a sequence that contains a putative
furin cleavage site that is critical for the entry of the virus into human cells [2]. A cell3

surface host serine protease, TMPRSS2, is also thought to be involved in viral entry
and is proposed to cleave S1 and S2, leading to activation of the fusion machinery
[1]. By analogy with SARS-CoV, it is expected that the virus can fuse at the cell
surface or later, following internalisation (reviewed in [3]).
Paradoxically, ACE2 is expressed at quite low levels by most cell types [4] and by
very few cell lines, leading to suggestions that additional receptor sites must exist.
Viruses, such as herpes simplex and the β coronavirus family, are known to interact
with host glycosaminoglycans [5]. A growing body of evidence suggests that SARSCoV-2 can bind the glycosaminoglycans, heparan sulphate and heparin, dependent
on their level of sulphation [6–9] and that heparin can inhibit SARS CoV 2 entry into
host cells. Initial binding to heparan sulphates is thought to keep the spike protein
within an ‘open’ conformation allowing for downstream binding and processing by
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 respectively [8].
Here we present a new assay for viral attachment to host cells, using a human
bladder epithelial cell line that expresses both ACE2 and TMPRSS2. The intact viral
spike protein, but not the isolated S1 or RBD, exhibits a temperature dependent
interaction that allows rapid detection by flow cytometry. We have used this assay to
confirm that heparin can inhibit spike protein interactions and demonstrate that high
affinity heparin binding requires the putative furin cleavage site and the S2 domain of
the viral spike protein but is independent of the S1 domain.

Unfractionated heparin (Leo, 1000U/ml), dalteparin (25000IU/ml) and enoxaparin
(10000IU/ml) were obtained from the Royal Hallamshire Hospital Pharmacy,
Sheffield, UK. Fondaparinux was purchased from Merck, UK. Goat anti-human
ACE2 antibody AF933 (Biotechne), goat control IgG AB-108-C (Biotechne), rabbit
anti-human TMPRSS2 (MBS9215011, Gentaur), rabbit IgG control (Biolegend) were
used as per manufacturers’ instructions.

Cell culture
The RT4 (ATCC® HTB-2TM) cell line was obtained from American Tissue Type
Collection (ATCC) and cultured in McCoys 5A medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (FCS). The A549 cell line was obtained
from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (ECACC) and cultured in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. The 293T (ATCC® CRL-3216TM) cell line was
obtained from ATCC and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. 293TACE2
cells were kindly provided by Paul Bieniasz (The Rockefeller University, USA),
cultured as described for 293T cells including selection with 5ug/ml blasticidin. A
human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT (300493), was obtained from Cell Line Services

levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were investigated by Comparative CT experiments
and GAPDH expression was measured as an endogenous control. All primers were
designed using PrimerBLAST (see Supplementary Table 1 for primer sequences).
The A549 cell line has been used as a reference for ACE2/TMPRSS2 gene
expression and the data is presented as mean Relative Quantification (RQ).

Detection of cell surface ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression
A549 and RT4 cells were harvested using trypsin/EDTA and resuspended in BBN
(Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS), 0.1% (w/v) Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA),
0.2% (w/v) sodium azide). Cells were incubated with anti-human ACE2 and a goat
immunoglobulin control at 15ug/ml, or anti-human TMPRSS2 and a rabbit
immunoglobulin negative control at 40ug/ml for 60 min at 37C, then washed twice in
BBN. Cell associated immunoglobulin was detected with an appropriate FITClabelled secondary antibody and fluorescence measured using an Attune NXT
cytometer (Thermofisher, UK). Data are shown as relative fluorescence intensities
calculated as a percentage of the negative control fluorescence.

tag at the C-terminus was expressed in baculovirus-insect cells, while S1-Fc (Val16Arg685; Stratech UK) with a mouse IgG1 Fc region at the C-terminus was expressed
in HEK293 cells. Modified S1S2 (mS1S2) and the receptor binding domain (RBD)
cloned into a pCAGGS expression vector were kindly provided by Florian Krammer
(Mount Sinai, USA) [10]. A polybasic cleavage site, recognised by furin, was
removed (RRAR to A) in mS1S2 and two stabilising mutations were added (K986P
and V987P). A thrombin cleavage site, a T4 foldon sequence allowing trimerization
and a His6 tag were fused to the C-terminal amino acid P1213. RBD was expressed
using the natural signal peptide fused to RBD (aa 419-541) and a His6 tag at the C
terminus. Recombinant proteins were expressed and purified as described
previously [10].

Spike protein interaction assay
Cells were harvested by brief trypsinisation and added to wells of a 96-well U bottom
plate. After centrifugation at 300xg for 3 min and washing with HBSS containing
divalent cations and 0.1% BSA (assay buffer, AB), cells were incubated with
potential inhibitors in 50µl AB for 30 min at 37°C. The supernatant was removed
following centrifugation and 25µl of AB containing S1-Fc (Stratech UK), RBD-His6
(produced in-house) or S1S2-His6 protein (Stratech UK) added before incubation at
4, 21 or 37°C for 60 min. Cells were washed once and then incubated with the
appropriate fluorescently labelled secondary antibody (anti-mouse polyvalent IgFITC (Merck) or anti-His6 HIS.H8 DyLight 488, (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 21°C. Cells
were finally resuspended in 50µl AB containing propidium iodide and cell-associated

control cells.

Determination of spike protein binding to heparin by ELISA
Heparin-binding plates (Plasso EpranExTM), a gift from Dr David Buttle (University of
Sheffield, UK), were coated with 10µg/ml of UFH or dalteparin diluted in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) (150μl/well) at room temperature overnight. Wells were
washed twice with PBS 0.05% Tween (PBST), blocked with PBST with 1% BSA for 2
hr at 37 °C before three further washes with PBST. Various concentration of Histagged spike proteins in AB buffer (or AB buffer control) were added to the wells
(50μl/well) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 hr. Wells were washed three times as above
then incubated at room temperature with 50μl/well biotin-labelled rabbit monoclonal
anti-His6 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted to 1/1000 in AB for 1 hr, washed 3 times
with PBST and incubated for 30 min with 50μl/well streptavidin-HRP (Pierce) diluted
1/200 in AB. After washing 3 times with PBST and twice with dH2O, 50μl per well
TMB substrate solution (Novex) was added followed by 50μl 1M HCl to quench the
reaction. Absorbance was measured at OD450nm with non-specific spike protein
binding to uncoated wells subtracted.

expresses neither ACE2 or TMPRSS2, perhaps explaining why this cell line does not
support infection by SARS-CoV-2 [12]. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA expression was
also low in 293T cells, while ACE2 expression was considerably higher in 293TACE2
cells (6074 fold increase from A549 cells). In contrast, HaCaT skin keratinocytes
have the highest native ACE2 expression (277 fold increase from A549) but there
was no expression of TMPRSS2 (Table 1; Fig 1). The Caco2 colorectal
adenocarcinoma cell line, used in several infection studies of SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 [13], was previously reported to express no ACE2 but high levels of
TMPRSS2, however, qPCR analysis has demonstrated a 16 and 122 fold higher
mRNA expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 respectively compared to A549 cells.
Similarly, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was 37 and 714 times higher
respectively in the urinary bladder epithelial cell line, RT4 [14], compared to A549
cells (Fig 1). RT4 cells also express ADAM17, a metalloprotease known to be
involved in the processing of ACE2, and CD9, an adaptor protein that controls
ADAM17 trafficking and activity [15] (Table 1). Finally, RT4 cells also express
rhomboid-like 2 (RHBDL2), a protease known to associate with ADAM17 [16],
making this cell line a suitable choice for the study of viral attachment.

Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 at the surface of RT4 cells
We used flow cytometry to compare the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 on RT4
and A549 cells. Despite high levels of mRNA within RT4 cells we observed only low
levels of ACE2 at the surface of RT4 cells (Fig. 1), however, we cannot rule out the
potential of a rapidly cycling population of ACE2 at the cell surface. TMPRSS2
expression was high in RT4 cells with little to no expression of either protein
observed in A549 cells (Fig 1).

Interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins with RT4 and A549 cells
To detect spike protein interactions, we used recombinant S1 tagged with mouse Fc
and RBD or intact S1S2, both His6 tagged. Following published interaction studies
for S1 [17], assays were initially performed at 21°C, using fluorescently labelled
secondary antibodies to stain cells for flow cytometry. Only a very low level of S1
interacting with RT4 cells was detected, while S1 interaction with A549 cells was
undetectable (S1 Fig). In contrast, S1S2 protein interacted strongly with subsets of
both RT4 and A549 cells, however, a higher percentage of RT4 cells were positive
compared to A549 cells (Fig 2A). Association with RT4 cells was detectable from
100nM S1S2 (Fig 2B) but was not saturated at 330nM, the highest concentration that
could be used due to limited availability of the S1S2 protein.
To determine if the levels of detectable S1S2 interacting with RT4 cells were being
affected by internalisation of the tagged protein, we performed assays at both 4°C,

which should largely inhibit internalisation, and at 37°C, which should be permissive
for internalisation. Surprisingly, interaction of S1S2 at 37°C was much stronger than
at 4°C or 21°C (Fig 3), with all cells stained. In contrast, S1 or RBD protein
association was undetectable at 4°C and only slightly elevated at 37°C (Fig 3).
Interaction with A549 cells at 37°C was much lower than to RT4 cells (Fig 4A) at all
concentrations tested although the cytometry histogram indicated that all cells had
some S1S2 attached. This suggests that interaction at 37°C may be at least partly
dependent on ACE2 and/or TMPRSS2 expression. S1S2 must be internalised only
slowly, if at all, over the time course of the assay at 37°C. However, the temperature
dependency suggests that S1S2 might undergo a conformational change, perhaps
as a result of proteolytic processing at the cell surface. We were unable to determine
the affinity of the interaction due to limited availability of recombinant S1S2, but
association was still increasing even at 330nM (Fig 4C), suggesting the limiting step
is a relatively low affinity interaction. This is in contrast to published reports of the
affinity of S1 for 293T cells overexpressing human ACE2 (~10nM) [17]. The
polybasic site between the S1 and S2 domains (681PRRARSV687) is a putative furin
cleavage site and has been shown to be essential for infection of human lung cells
[2]. A mutant S1S2 (mS1S2) protein lacking the putative furin cleavage site
demonstrated reduced interaction with RT4 cells compared to wtS1S2, similar to the
S1 RBD alone (Fig4B, C). This might suggest the importance of proteolytic
processing of the spike protein during viral association with the cell, although we
cannot rule out the importance of a pair of stabilising modifications 300 amino acids
C-terminal of the polybasic cleavage site within the mS1S2 [10] or potential
differences in trimerization of the two proteins.

S1S2 can interact with human cells independent of ACE2

As we observed some S1S2 interaction with A549 cells which lack ACE2, we sought
to further investigate the role of spike protein interaction with ACE2 by assessing
wtS1S2 and RBD attachment to 293T or 293TACE2 cells (Fig 4D). wtS1S2 and RBD
interacted with 293T cells overexpressing ACE2 with similar affinities (EC50 =
137.7nM and 49.1nM, respectively). In contrast, wtS1S2 associated with 293T cells
expressing little ACE2, albeit at 5x lower affinity (EC50 = 784.6nM), while the affinity
of the interaction of RBD with these cells was almost undetectable. This suggests
that the initial interaction of S1S2 with cells is independent of ACE2, perhaps via an
alternative receptor, whereas interaction of RBD alone requires high levels of cell
surface ACE2.

Unfractionated heparin inhibits S1S2 binding to RT4 cells
Having developed a novel assay that mimics some aspects of SARS-CoV-2
infection, we used it to test potential inhibitors. Although an anti-ACE2 antibody has
previously been reported in one publication to block viral binding to host cells [1],
preincubating RT4 cells with the same antibody caused a significant increase in
S1S2 interaction (54.25% above untreated cells, p=0.0025) (Fig. 5A). Antibodymediated cross-linking of ACE2 at the cell surface may allow rapid attachment of the
spike protein due to receptor clustering. Heparin has also been reported to bind
directly to S1 and to interfere with SARS-CoV-2 infection [7] and so we tested the
effects of pre-incubating RT4 cells with heparin on the S1S2 attachment at 37°C.
Unfractionated heparin (UFH) at 10U/ml inhibited 80% of 330nM S1S2 interaction
with the cells (Fig 5B) and was significantly reduced compared to untreated controls
(Fig 5C). Using 100nM S1S2, the inhibition by UFH was complete with an IC50 of
0.033U/ml (95% confidence interval 0.016-0.07) (Fig 6). This is far below the target
prophylactic and therapeutic concentrations of UFH in serum, 0.1-0.4U/ml and 0.312

0.7U/ml, respectively [18,19]. Furthermore, the effect of UFH was also not caused by
blockade of the His6 tag-antibody interaction (S2 Fig A), which was not affected in
ELISA by concentrations of UFH of 500U/ml. In contrast, two low molecular weight
heparins (LMWH), dalteparin and enoxaparin, were only partial inhibitors, and were
less potent than UFH (IC50 values of 0.558 and 0.072U/ml, respectively). Typical
prophylactic and therapeutic serum concentrations of LMWH are 0.2-0.5IU/ml and
0.5-1.2IU/ml [20], respectively, suggesting that dalteparin may be used below the
effective dose required for inhibition of viral infection if used prophylactically. The
synthetic pentasaccharide heparinoid, fondaparinux, had no effect on S1S2
interaction at concentrations up to 0.1mg/ml, although it has a therapeutic
concentration of <2ug/ml [21] (Fig 6).

S1S2 that lacks the furin cleavage site has a lower affinity for
heparin than wild type S1S2
The polybasic site furin cleavage site in S1S2 might also be a heparin binding site
[22] and so we investigated if altered heparin binding by the mS1S2 might be linked
to the lower binding to RT4 cells. mS1S2 and RBD had a significantly lower affinity
for both UFH (mS1S2, EC50 = 217.8nM; RBD, EC50 = 818.4nM) and LMWH (mS1S2,
EC50 = 162.2nM; RBD, EC50 = 288.3nM) relative to wild type (EC50 = 6.8nM and
9.3nM, respectively) (Fig 7). It is likely that wtS1S2 contains multiple binding sites for
heparin that confer high avidity, and the polybasic furin cleavage site might be one of
the most important of these sites. Additional sites may be present in S1 and RBD but
these are of relatively low affinity. Interestingly, all the spike proteins bound UFH and
dalteparin with similar affinities and so binding to immobilised heparins does not

obviously explain the difference between UFH and LMWH in the inhibition of cell
binding.

Discussion
We have demonstrated that intact recombinant wtS1S2 spike protein but not the S1
domain from SARS-CoV-2 can interact strongly with a human cell line that expresses
ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Furthermore, S1S2 was able to associate with human cells
independently of ACE2 expression, while the RBD alone could not. Using this assay,
we have further shown that UFH and two low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) in
use clinically can inhibit S1S2 binding. The same activity profile for UFH and one
LMWH (enoxaparin) has been demonstrated in SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD binding affinity
[7]. These authors also showed that heparin could interact with recombinant S1 RBD
and cause conformational changes, leading to the suggestion that SARS-CoV-2
might interact with host heparan sulphates through the RBD during infection.
Our data significantly extends this observation, suggesting the presence of multiple
heparin binding sites in the intact spike protein, with one at the furin cleavage site
and others in the S2 domain and within the RBD. As previously noted, the presence
of multiple polybasic sites within the spike protein will result in a higher avidity of
binding to heparin and heparan sulphates [9]. Interestingly, all the spike proteins
tested had similar affinities for UFH and LMWH and so the differing abilities of these
forms of heparin to inhibit S1S2 interactions with cells is not simply due to divergent
affinities. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of differing glycosylation states
affecting attachment of the recombinant proteins as their expression conditions

Whilst previous studies have used African green monkey cells or human cells
overexpressing relevant SARS-CoV-2 receptors, we have focused on native human
cell lines. With reports of increased urinary frequency as an overlapping symptom of
COVID-19 [23] and high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 we have identified
urinary bladder epithelial RT4 cells as a relevant model of infection for SARS-CoV-2.
Whilst we demonstrate that ACE2 is involved, the intact spike protein was still able to
interact with cells in the absence of ACE2 suggesting further secondary receptors.
The ability of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to attach to various glycosaminoglycans
provides a host of candidate proteins at the cell surface. Studies have also
suggested the importance of differing glycan sulphation states in different tissues as
an explanation for viral tropism. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 has been
shown to bind heparan sulphates with varying degrees of sulphation with differing
affinities; chain length and 6-O-sulphation were particularly important [8].
UFH, and to a lesser extent, LMWH, are potent inhibitors of S1S2 interaction with
human cells. LMWH are smaller (<8kDa) than UFH, which is a mix of polysaccharide
chain lengths from ~5-40kDa, and have more predictable pharmacokinetics [24].
LMWH are already commonly used both prophylactically and therapeutically in
COVID-19 patients and have been reported to improve patient outcome [25]. Our
work and the work of Mycroft-West et al suggests that thought be given to the earlier
use of heparin when viral infection is still an important driver of disease severity. The
use of UFH rather than LMWH should also be considered, although we note that
administration and the safety profile of UFH might preclude this in some cases [26].
Fondaparinux contains only the antithrombin III interaction site and cannot form a
ternary complex with thrombin, unlike UFH [21]. This suggests that efficient inhibition
of S1S2 binding may require an interaction between heparin and two different sites

on the spike protein. For example, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein optimally binds hexaand octasaccharides composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S, a motif abundantly present
within heparin but not heparan sulphates [9]. The LMWH may contain sufficient long
polymer chains to make this dual interaction but with lower efficacy than UFH.
Finally, heparin could also be inhibiting host proteases, like Factor Xa, necessary to
process the spike protein [27]. However, our data demonstrated no activity of
fondaparinux and lower efficacy of dalteparin despite the inhibitory nature of the two
compounds on Factor Xa.
In conclusion, we have developed a simple flow cytometric assay for measuring
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interaction with human cells, demonstrating both S1S2
interaction with cells independent of ACE2 and potent inhibition of S1S2 association
by UFH and LMWH. Our new assay could be a rapid initial screen for novel inhibitors
of coronavirus infection.

RT-qPCR and flow cytometry were used to compare the relative expression of ACE2
and TMPRSS2 across several human cell lines. To investigate gene expression
levels, RNA was extracted, converted to cDNA and RT-qPCR was performed by
SYBR Green assay. To investigate protein expression levels, RT4 and A549 cells
were stained with goat anti-human ACE2 or rabbit anti-human TMPRSS2 antibodies
and the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies. (A) Relative mRNA
quantification of ACE2 (white) and TMPRSS2 (grey) in various cell lines compared to
A549 cells (set at 101), n>2 (B) Relative fluorescence intensity of ACE2 and
