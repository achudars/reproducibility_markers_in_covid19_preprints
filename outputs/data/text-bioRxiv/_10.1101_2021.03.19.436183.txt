ABSTRACT

22

Hyperimmune immunoglobulin (hCoV-2IG) preparations generated from SARS-CoV-2

23

convalescent plasma (CP) are under evaluation in several clinical trials of hospitalized COVID-19

24

patients. Here we explored the antibody epitope repertoire, antibody binding and virus neutralizing

25

capacity of six hCoV-2IG batches as well as nine convalescent plasma (CP) lots against SARS-

26

CoV-2 and emerging variants of concern (VOC). The Gene-Fragment Phage display library

27

spanning the SARS-CoV-2 spike demonstrated broad recognition of multiple antigenic sites

28

spanning the entire spike including NTD, RBD, S1/S2 cleavage site, S2-fusion peptide and S2-

29

heptad repeat regions. Antibody binding to the immunodominant epitopes was higher for hCoV-

30

2IG than CP, with predominant binding to the fusion peptide. In the pseudovirus neutralization

31

assay (PsVNA) and in the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 PRNT assay, hCoV-2IG lots showed higher

32

titers against the WA-1 strain compared with CP. Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs from

33

around the globe were reduced to different levels by hCoV-2IG lots. The most significant loss of

34

neutralizing activity was seen against the B.1.351 (9-fold) followed by P.1 (3.5-fold), with minimal

35

loss of activity against the B.1.17 and B.1.429 (<2-fold). Again, the CP showed more pronounced

36

loss of cross-neutralization against the VOCs compared with hCoV-2IG. Significant reduction of

37

hCoV-2IG binding was observed to the RBD-E484K followed by RBD-N501Y and minimal loss

38

of binding to RBD-K417N compared with unmutated RBD. This study suggests that post-exposure

39

treatment with hCoV-2IG is preferable to CP. In countries with co-circulating SARS-CoV-2

40

variants, identifying the infecting virus strain could inform optimal treatments, but would likely

41

require administration of higher volumes or repeated infusions of hCOV-2IG or CP, in patients

42

infected with the emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

INTRODUCTION

45

An expedited access to treatment of COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma was

46

issued by FDA via Emergency Use Authorization on August 23, 2020. Additional studies,

47

including randomized, controlled trials, have provided data to further inform the safety and

48

efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Based on assessment of these data, potential clinical

49

benefit of transfusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma in hospitalized patients with COVID-19

50

is associated with high neutralizing titer units administered early in the course of disease(1, 2).

51

Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) are a more concentrated form of IgG preparations

52

fractionated from large number of plasma units that are prescreened for the presence of high titer

53

anti-spike antibodies and predetermined SARS-CoV-2 neutralization titers. Several hCoV-2IG lots

54

are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. The effectiveness of hCoV-2 IG products may be

55

hampered by evolving SARS-CoV-2 and the emergence of new variants with high transmissibility

56

rates and mutations in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) which are less susceptible to

57

antibodies from recovered COVID-19 patients. The main variants of concern (VOC) are the

58

B.1.1.7 spreading from the UK, the B1.351 spreading in South Africa (SA), and the P.1 that

59

appeared in northeast Brazil and found in Japan (JP). In the US, several variants were identified

60

recently including California (CA) variant B.1.429 (3-6).

61

The phage display technique is suitable to display properly folded and conformationally

62

active proteins, as it has been widely used for display of large functionally-active antibodies,

63

enzymes, hormones, and viral and mammalian proteins. We have adapted this Genome Fragment

64

Phage Display Library (GFPDL) technology for unbiased, comprehensive approach for multiple

65

viral pathogens including SARS-CoV-2, Ebola virus, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus,

66

respiratory syncytial virus and Zika virus, to define both the linear and conformational antibody

67

epitope repertoire of post-vaccination/infection samples (7-11)

68

In the current study we probed the antibody epitope repertoires of 6 hCoV-2IG products

69

using SARS-CoV-2-spike GFPDL. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) was used to measure

70

antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2 antigenic site peptides identified in the GFPDL analyses and to

71

spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) representing WA-1 as well RBD mutants engineered

72

to express key amino acid mutations of the VOCs. Neutralization capacity of the hCoV-2IG lots

73

against the SARS-CoV-2 WA-1 strain and several VOC (CA, UK, JP, SA) was measured in

74

pseudovirion neutralization assay (PsVNA) as well as classical PRNT assay. For comparison with

75

hCoV-2IG, we evaluated nine convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients and 16

76

IVIG preparations that were manufactured with pre-pandemic plasma units prior to August 2019.

RESULTS

79

SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody epitope repertoires of six hCoV-2IG batches

80

The spike protein is the antigen of choice for development of vaccines and therapeutics

81

against SARS-CoV-2. To decipher the epitope-specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific

82

antibodies in an unbiased manner, we subjected the six hCoV-2IG lots to antibody epitope

83

profiling with a highly diverse SARS-CoV-2 spike GFPDL with >107.1 unique phage clones

84

displaying epitopes of 18-500 amino acid residues across the SARS-CoV-2 spike. During GFPDL

85

characterization, GFPDL based epitope mapping of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) targeting

86

SARS-CoV-2 spike or RBD identified the expected linear or conformation-dependent epitopes

87

recognized by these MAbs. Recently, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 spike GFPDL can recognize

88

both linear, conformational and neutralizing epitopes in the post-vaccination sera of rabbits (11)

89

and post-SARS-CoV-2 infection sera in the adults and elderly (10, 12).

90

Six hCoV-2IG lots were used for SARS-CoV-2 GFPDL based epitope mapping as

91

previously described (7-11, 13). Similar numbers of phages were bound by IgG of these hCoV-

92

2IG batches (3.4 x 104 – 2.1 x 105) (Fig. 1A). The bound phages demonstrated a diverse epitope

93

repertoire spanning the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike protein including N-terminal domain (NTD) and

94

RBD in S1, and the fusion peptide (FP), β-rich connector domain (CD), heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and

95

2 (HR2) in S2 (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1). Peptides representing the key immunodominant antigenic

96

sites identified by GFPDL analysis were chemically synthesized and used to evaluate binding of

97

each of the six hCoV-2IG batches, 16 pre-pandemic 2019-IVIG lots and 9 COVID-19

98

convalescent plasma (Fig. 1C). As expected 2019-IVIG demonstrated minimal to no binding to

99

the SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides. In aggregate, the convalescent plasma showed lower binding to

100

epitopes spanning the entire spike in comparison with the hCoV-2IG (Fig. 1C). In agreement with

101

GFPDL analysis, the hCoV-2IG demonstrated highest antibody binding to the spike peptide 790-

102

834 that contains the fusion peptide sequence (residues 788-806), which is unchanged among the

103

major VOCs ((Fig. S2 and Table S1). Most of the GFPDL-identified antigenic site sequences

104

recognized by hCoV-2IGs are conserved in the spike protein of various SARS-CoV-2 VOC (Table

105

S1).

109

PsVNA was used to measure the neutralization activity of six hCoV-2 IG, nine CP, and 16

110

pre-pandemic 2019-IVIG lots against the predominant SARS-CoV-2 WA-1 strain and the VOCs

111

currently spreading around the globe; U.S./CA (B.1.429), UK (B.1.1.7), JP (P.1), and SA

112

(B.1.351). Both 50% (PsVNA50) and 80% (PsVNA80) neutralization titers were calculated. The

113

spike proteins mutations in the VOCs used for production of the pseudovirions are shown in Table

114

S2.

115

All sixteen pre-pandemic 2019-IVIG preparations demonstrated titers of <20 PsVNA50

116

against SARS-CoV-2 strains (Fig. 2A and Table S3). Among the nine CP lots tested against WA-

117

1, variable PsVNA50 titers were observed, including one negative, one low (<1:80), six medium

118

(>1:160<1:640) and two high (>1:640). In contrast, all six hCoV-2IG lots exhibited high

119

PsVNA50 titers against WA-1 ranging between 1:1238-1:3309. PsVNA80 titers for hCoV-2IG

120

ranged between 1:168-1:593, but none of the CP lots showed PsVNA80 titers above 1:80 (range

121

<20 to 1:74) against WA-1 (Table S3). Neutralization of the VOCs showed gradual loss of titers

122

as determined by either PsVNA50 or PsVNA80 for the hCoV-2IG and the CPs with greatest

123

reduction in titers measured against the SA VOC (Fig. 2A and Table S3).

124

For confirmation of the PsVNA neutralization titers, the six hCoV-2IG lots were also

125

evaluated in a classical PRNT assay using VERO-E6 cells against authentic SARS-CoV-2 viruses

126

representing WA-1 (USA-WA1/2020), UK-B1.1.7 (hCoV-19/England/204820464/2020), and

127

SA-B1.351 (South Africa/KRISP-K005325/2020) strains (Fig. 2B and Table S4). Correlation of

128

hCoV-2IG neutralization titers between PRNT50 and PsVNA50 were observed, as well as a

129

similar decline in neutralization titers against the UK and SA VOC compared with WA-1 strain

130

(Table S4 and Fig. 2B-C). Since all hCoV-2IG lots contain 100 mg/mL of IgG, it allowed

131

calculation of ID50 values for the six hCoV-2IG lots (Table S5 and Fig 2D).

132

Compared to the WA-1 strain, the average PsVNA50 of the hCoV-2IG against CA, UK,

133

JP and SA VOC were reduced by 1.7, 1.9, 3.5, and 9.2-fold respectively (Fig. 2E). Since the

134

amount of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG in CP lots is more variable and 5-10 fold lower compared

135

with the hyperimmune hCoV-2IG, the CPs exhibited greater loss of neutralizing activities against

136

the variants in comparison with hCoV-2IG. The average PsVNA50 of the CP against the CA, UK,

137

JP, and SA VOC were reduced by 3.1, 3.3, 3.9, and 18.7-fold, respectively (Table S3 and Fig. 2F).

138

PsVNA80 titers against the UK and JP VOC for all 9 CPs were lower (~2-fold) and were minimal

139

or negligible against the SA VOC (Fig. 2A and Table S3). For hCoV-2IG, the PsVNA80 titers

140

were similar for the WA-1, CA and UK strains, reduced by 1.75-fold against the JP variant, and

141

decreased by 4.3-fold for SA VOC (Fig. 2A).

142
143

Antibody binding of hCoV-2IG batches to RBD and RBD mutants: K417N, N501Y, and

144

E484K

145

Many of the mutations in the spike protein of the different SARS-CoV-2 VOCs are unique

146

(Fig. S2, Table S2), but a few key mutations among these strains are shared by VOCs as shown in

147

Table S2. N501Y is shared among the UK, JP, and SA variants. E484K is shared between the JP

148

and SA variants, and K417 is mutated to T in the JP variant, and to N in the SA variant. These key

149

mutated residues have been shown to impact binding and neutralizing activity of antibodies in the

150

post-infection and post-vaccination sera (14) (15). To further explore the possible contribution of

151

these mutations in binding of hCoV-2IG batches, purified RBD proteins with individual mutations

152

(K417N, N501Y, and E484K) were analyzed in SPR based antibody binding assays (Fig. 2G). The

153

K417N had minimal to no impact on hCoV-2IG binding. The hCoV-2IG binding to RBD-N501Y

154

was reduced by ~2-fold compared with WA-1 RBD. However, binding to RBD-E484K resulted

155

in average 19-fold reduction in hCoV-2IG binding compared with the WA-1 RBD (Fig. 2H).

156
157

DISCUSSION

158

In the current study we conducted in-depth analyses on six lots of hyperimmune globulin

159

(hCoV-2IG) manufactured from plasma units collected from SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals

160

in 2020. Antibody epitope repertoire, neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and VOCs, and binding to

161

spike peptides as well as recombinant RBD expressing individual mutations observed in the VOC

162

were evaluated in comparison with 9 convalescent plasma and 16 pre-pandemic 2019-IVIG.

163

The antibody epitope repertoires using SARS-CoV-2 spike GFPDL identified a diverse

164

epitope fingerprint of both short and large antigenic sites spanning the entire spike protein. The

165

hCoV-2IG antibodies most frequently bound to sites in the NTD, S1/S2 cleavage site, fusion

166

peptide and heptad repeat domains in S2. In recent studies with monoclonal antibodies isolated

167

from SARS-CoV-2 memory cells from COVID-19 patients, multiple neutralizing antibodies were

168

identified that targeted the RBD, S1-NTD, S2, and S protein trimer(16-18). The most potent

169

neutralizing antibodies that target directly the RBM/ACE2 interface were isolated at low frequency

170

(19).

171

In light of the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern around the globe, it is

172

important to evaluate the therapeutic potential of both CP and hCoV-2IG against both early

173

circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains and the emerging VOCs (20-22) that can define the therapeutic

174

potential of these antibody preparations. In the current study, all six hCoV-2IG lots demonstrated

175

a small decline in neutralization titers (and increase in ID50) against CA, UK (~ 2-fold) followed

8

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.19.436183; this version posted March 19, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

176

by JP (~3.5-fold) VOC, and a significant decrease in neutralization activity against SA VOC (~9-

177

fold). The nine CP evaluated demonstrated a range of neutralization titers compared with the

178

hCoV-2IG against the WA-1 strain, and a larger reduction in PsVNA50 titers against the VOCs

179

compared with hCoV-2IG.

180

Most of the SARS-CoV-2 VOCs that have been spreading in different parts of the world

181

have multiple mutations both in the spike and other genes. However, several VOCs share one or

182

more mutations in the RBD. Decrease in antibody binding to the RBD interface with ACE2

183

receptor is probably the key reason for loss of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity against the

184

VOCs. Interestingly, while most of the interactions between the Receptor Binding Motif (RBM)

185

25 residues and the predominant IGHV3-53/IGHV3-66 neutralizing antibodies are mediated by

186

hydrogen bonds. Only K417 and E484 have been described to form a salt bridge resulting in a

187

stronger interaction and higher immune pressure (23). We found that the E484K mutation, which

188

is shared between Brazil/JP P.1 VOC and SA B.1.351 VOC significantly reduced binding of

189

hCoV-2IG to the RBD (19-fold reduction) compared with RBD-wt. In contrast, the K417N had

190

only minimal effect on RBD binding and the N501Y reduced binding of the hCoV-2IG by 2-fold.

191

Therefore, virus neutralization may be impacted both by specific amino acid mutations in the

192

RBD/RBM and by the specificity of the polyclonal antibodies that bind to other sites on the SARS-

193

CoV-2 spike.

194

The correlate of protection in terms of antibody neutralizing titers has not been identified

195

in ongoing vaccine trials. However, studies in rhesus macaques showed that passive transfer of

196

250 mg/kg SARS-CoV-2 IgG one day after challenge, reduced the peak lung viral loads and

197

cleared the virus by day 3 (24). Convalescent plasma demonstrated significant loss of neutralizing

198

activities against the emerging VOC, especially the SA B.1.351(14). However, some reduction in
9

199

post-vaccination titers was observed against the new variants, especially the South African VOC,

200

but SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that elicit high and durable neutralization titers may still be effective

201

against severe disease associated with VOCs (15).

202

Our study underscores the advantage of using hyperimmune immunoglobulin products

203

(hCoV-2IG) compared with CP for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The neutralizing

204

titers were found to decline significantly after 3 or 4 months in recovered COVD-19 patients (25).

205

Therefore, screening of multiple CP units prior to pooling for fractionation can ensure high

206

neutralizing titer hCoV-2 IG products and lot to lot consistency. The added values of hCoV-2IG

207

over CP is even more critical in the face of emerging more transmissible VOCs that are spreading

208

in several countries around the globe. Casadevall et al. emphasized that antibody preparations

209

should contain sufficiently high concentrations of specific immunoglobulin to mediate biological

210

effect against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants and should be administered early post-exposure (26).

211

In summary, both CP and hCoV-2IG demonstrated reduced neutralization titers ranging

212

from ~2-4 fold against UK & JP VOCs and ~10-20 fold against SA VOC. Our findings indicate

213

that treatment of COVID-19 patients with hCoV-2IG/CP may still be feasible but would likely

214

require administration of higher volumes, or repeated infusions, in patients infected with the

215

emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. This will require rapid development of RT-PCR based

216

diagnostics or other diagnostic assays that are designed to differentiate the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351

217

variants, and other emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants like the California (B.1.429) and Japan (P.1)

218

strains. Furthermore, in countries where a new VOC becomes dominant, the manufacturing of new

219

hCoV-2IG should incorporate screening of the plasma and of the hCoV-2IG lots for neutralization

220

activities against VOC. This study suggests that in countries with multiple co-circulating SARS-

221

CoV-2 variants, the identification of the infecting SARS-CoV-2 strain prior to treatment with

METHODS

226

Study design

227

The objective of this study was to investigate antibody binding and neutralizing capacity of various

228

therapeutic polyclonal CP or purified hCoV-2-IG antibody preparations being evaluated in the

229

clinical trials with important emerging SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC). Such variants of

230

concern (VOC) are the United Kingdom (UK) variant B.1.1.7, California (CA) variant B.1.429,

231

Japan (JP) variant P.1, and the South Africa (SA) variant B.1.351. There are multiple IVIG

232

products approved by the FDA. These are polyclonal antibodies made from U.S. plasma donors.

233

Each lot of product is derived from 10,000 or more donors. The manufacturing processes vary

234

between manufacturers and usually include cold alcohol fractionation (Cohn-Oncley), anion-

235

exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. Sixteen intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)

236

batches were produced from plasma collected in 2019 (each lot derived from >10,000 donors)

237

from five manufacturers, prior to August 2019. The final product is sterile-filtered IgG (> 95%)

238

and formulated at 100 mg/mL Nine random CP lots were obtained from recovered COVID-19

239

patients. Six hCoV-2IG batches prepared from 250-400 COVID-19 CP donors per lot were

240

obtained from three commercial companies. This study was approved by the Food and Drug

241

249

variant (P.1 strain with spike mutations L18F, T20N, P26S, D138Y, R190S, K417T, E484K,

250

N501Y, H655Y, T1027I, D614G, V1176F) (Table S1). The PsVNA using 293-ACE2-TMPRSS2

251

cell line was described previously (10, 11).

252

Briefly, human codon-optimized cDNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein of the WA-

253

1, UK VOC, CA VOC, JP VOC and SA VOC was synthesized by GenScript and cloned into

254

eukaryotic cell expression vector pcDNA 3.1 between the BamHI and XhoI sites. Pseudovirions

255

were produced by co-transfection Lenti‐X 293T cells with psPAX2(gag/pol), pTrip-luc lentiviral

256

vector and pcDNA 3.1 SARS-CoV-2-spike-deltaC19, using Lipofectamine 3000. The supernatants

257

were harvested at 48h post transfection and filtered through 0.45µm membranes and titrated using

258

293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells (HEK293T cells that express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins).

259

For the neutralization assay, 50 µL of SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions were pre-incubated

260

with an equal volume of medium containing serum at varying dilutions at room temperature for 1

261

h, then virus-antibody mixtures were added to 293T-ACE2-TMPRSS2 cells in a 96-well plate. The

262

input virus with all three SARS-CoV-2 strains used in the current study were the same (2x 105

263

Relative light units/50 µL/well). After a 3 h incubation, the inoculum was replaced with fresh

264

medium. Cells were lysed 24 h later, and luciferase activity was measured using luciferin. Controls

265

included cells only, virus without any antibody and positive sera. The cut-off value or the limit of

266

detection for neutralization assay is 1:10.

incubated with 2-fold serial dilutions in a round bottom plate at 37°C for 1 hr. The virus-antibody

272

mixture was then added to a 96-well plate with 5x104 Vero E6 cells. After 1 h the mixture was

273

removed and replenished with fresh MEM containing 2% FBS. Cells were incubated at 37°C for

274

an additional 48 hours, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by staining of cells with

275

0.1% crystal violet in 20% methanol. The PRNT50 and PRNT90 titers were calculated as the last

276

serum dilution resulting in at least 50% and 90% SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, respectively.

277
278

Proteins

279

Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) and its mutants were

280

purchased from Sino Biologicals (RBD-wt; 40592-V08H82, RBD-K417N; 40592-V08H59, RBD-

281

N501Y; 40592-V08H82 and RBD-E484K; 40592-V08H84). Recombinant purified RBD proteins

282

used in the study were produced in 293 mammalian cells. The native receptor-binding activity of

283

the spike RBD proteins was determined by binding to the 5 µg/mL human ACE2 protein(10-12).

285

SARS-CoV-2 Gene Fragment Phage Display Library (GFPDL) construction

286

DNA encoding the spike gene of SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (GenBank:

287

MN908947.3) was chemically synthesized and used for cloning. A gIII display-based phage

288

vector, fSK-9-3, was used where the desired polypeptide can be displayed on the surface of the

289

phage as a gIII-fusion protein. Purified DNA containing spike gene was digested with DNaseI to

290

obtain gene fragments of 50-1500 bp size range (18 to 500 amino acids) and used for GFPDL

291

construction as described previously (10-12).

293

Affinity selection of SARS-CoV-2 GFPDL phages

294

Prior to panning of GFPDL with polyclonal hCoV-2IG antibodies, Ig components, which

295

could non-specifically interact with phage proteins, were removed by incubation with UV-killed

296

M13K07 phage-coated Petri dishes. Equal volumes of each of the six hCoV-2IG lots were used

297

for GFPDL panning. GFPDL affinity selection was carried out in-solution with protein A/G resin

298

as previously described(10-12). Briefly, the hCoV-2IG lot was incubated with the GFPDL and the

299

protein A/G resin, the unbound phages were removed by PBST (PBS containing 0.1 % Tween-20)

300

wash followed by PBS. Bound phages were eluted by addition of 0.1 N Gly-HCl pH 2.2 and

301

neutralized by adding 8 µL of 2 M Tris solution per 100 µL eluate. After panning, antibody-bound

302

phage clones were amplified, the inserts were sequenced, and the sequences were aligned to the

303

SARS-CoV-2 spike gene, to define the fine epitope specificity in these polyclonal hCoV-2IG lots.

304

The GFPDL affinity selection was performed in duplicate (two independent experiments

305

by research fellow in the lab, who was blinded to sample identity). Similar numbers of bound

306

phage clones and epitope repertoire were observed in the two GFPDL panning.

308

Antibody binding kinetics to SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants or SARS-CoV-2 peptides by

309

Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)

310

Steady-state equilibrium binding of hCoV-2IG lots was monitored at 25°C using a ProteOn

311

surface plasmon resonance (BioRad). The purified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins were

312

captured to a Ni-NTA sensor chip with 200 resonance units (RU) in the test flow channels. The

313

protein density on the chip was optimized such as to measure monovalent interactions independent

314

of the antibody isotype (10-12, 27). The biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 peptides were captured on

315

NLC chip and used for peptide antibody profiling of hCoV-2IG, CP and 2019-IVIG lots.

316

Serial dilutions (1 mg/mL, 0.33 mg/mL and 0.11 mg/mL) of freshly prepared hCoV-2IG

317

or 2019-IVIG or 10-fold dilution of CP in BSA-PBST buffer (PBS pH 7.4 buffer with Tween-20

318

and BSA) were injected at a flow rate of 50 µL/min (120 sec contact duration) for association, and

319

disassociation was performed over a 600-second interval. Responses from the protein surface were

320

corrected for the response from a mock surface and for responses from a buffer-only injection.

321

SPR was performed with serially diluted samples in this study. Total antibody binding was

322

calculated with BioRad ProteOn manager software (version 3.1). All SPR experiments were

323

performed twice, and the researchers performing the assay were blinded to sample identity. The

324

maximum resonance units (Max RU) data shown in the figures were the calculated RU signal for

325

the 1 mg/mL hCoV-2IG sample or 2019-IVIG or 10-fold dilution of CP.

327

Statistical Analysis.

328

All experimental data were analyzed in GraphPad Prism, version 9.0.1 (GraphPad software Inc,

329

San Diego, CA) or R package. Differences between groups were analyzed using multiple group

330

comparisons by non-parametric (Kruskal-Wallis) statistical test using Dunn's post-hoc analysis.

331

The difference within each group were performed using one-way ANOVA using Tukey’s pairwise

332

multiple comparison test. The differences were considered statistically significant with a 95%

333

confidence interval when the p value was less than 0.05. (*, P values of ≤0.05, **, P values of

334

≤0.01, ***, P values of ≤ 0.001, ****, P ≤0.0001). Correlation analysis of PRNT and PsVNA titers

335

were performed by computing Pearson’s correlation coefficient in Graphpad.
