Abstract

20

Background: The coronavirus nonstructural protein 5 (Nsp5) is a cysteine protease required for

21

processing the viral polyprotein and is therefore crucial for viral replication. Nsp5 from several

22

coronaviruses have also been found to cleave host proteins, disrupting molecular pathways

23

involved in innate immunity. Nsp5 from the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus interacts with

24

and can cleave human proteins, which may be relevant to the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

25

Based on the continuing global pandemic, and emerging understanding of coronavirus Nsp5-

26

human protein interactions, we set out to predict what human proteins are cleaved by the

27

coronavirus Nsp5 protease using a bioinformatics approach.

28

Results: Using a previously developed neural network trained on coronavirus Nsp5 cleavage

29

sites (NetCorona), we made predictions of Nsp5 cleavage sites in all human proteins. Structures

30

of human proteins in the Protein Data Bank containing a predicted Nsp5 cleavage site were

31

then examined, generating a list of 92 human proteins with a highly predicted and accessible

32

cleavage site. Of those, 48 are expected to be found in the same cellular compartment as Nsp5.

33

Analysis of this targeted list of proteins revealed molecular pathways susceptible to Nsp5

34

cleavage and therefore relevant to coronavirus infection, including pathways involved in mRNA

35

processing, cytokine response, cytoskeleton organization, and apoptosis.

36

Conclusions: This study combines predictions of Nsp5 cleavage sites in human proteins with

37

protein structure information and protein network analysis. We predicted cleavage sites in

38

proteins recently shown to be cleaved in vitro by SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5, and we discuss how other

39

potentially cleaved proteins may be relevant to coronavirus mediated immune dysregulation.

40

The data presented here will assist in the design of more targeted experiments, to determine the

41

role of coronavirus Nsp5 cleavage of host proteins, which is relevant to understanding the

42

molecular pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Background

48

Coronaviruses are major human and livestock pathogens, and are the current focus of

49

international attention due to an ongoing global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory

50

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This recently emerged coronavirus likely originated in

51

bats in China, before passing to humans in late 2019 through a secondary animal vector [1, 2].

52

Although 79% identical at the nucleotide level to SARS-CoV [2], differences in the infectious

53

period and community spread of SARS-CoV-2 has caused a greater number of cases and

54

deaths worldwide [3, 4]. Individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 can develop COVID-19 disease

55

which primarily affects the lungs, but can also cause kidney damage, coagulopathy, liver

56

damage, and neuropathy [5-10]. Hyperinflammation, resulting from dysregulation of the immune

57

response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, has emerged as a leading hypothesis regarding severe

58

COVID-19 cases, which may also explain the diverse and systemic symptoms observed [11-14].

59

Similar to other coronaviruses, once a cell is infected, the 5’ portion of the SARS-CoV-2

60

(+)ssRNA genome is translated into nonstructural proteins (Nsps) required for viral replication,

61

which are expressed covalently linked to one another (Fig. 1a) [15]. This polyprotein must

62

therefore be cleaved to free the individual Nsps, which is performed by two virally encoded

63

proteases: Nsp3/papain-like protease (PLpro) and Nsp5/Main Protease (Mpro)/3C-like protease

64

(3CLpro). Nsp5 is responsible for the majority of polyprotein cleavages and its function is

65

conserved across coronaviruses [16, 17], making it a key drug target as its inhibition impedes

66

viral replication (reviewed by [18]).

67

All coronavirus Nsp5 proteases identified to date are cysteine proteases in the

68

chymotrypsin family, which primarily cleave peptides at P2-P1-P1’ residues leucine-glutamine2

69

alanine/serine [16, 17, 19, 20], where the cleavage occurs between the P1 and P1’ residues.

70

Nsp5 forms a homodimer for optimal catalytic function but may function as a monomer when

71

processing its own excision from the polyprotein [21-23]. SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5 shares 96.1%

72

sequence identity with SARS-CoV Nsp5 and has similar substrate specificity in vitro, but SARS-

73

CoV-2 Nsp5 accommodates more diverse residues at substrate position P2 and may have a

74

higher catalytic efficiency [22-25].

75

Coronavirus proteases also manipulate the cellular environment of infected cells to favor

76

viral replication [26, 27], and disrupt host interferon (IFN) signaling pathways to suppress the

77

anti-viral response of the innate immune system (reviewed by [28-30]). The role of coronavirus

78

protease Nsp3 as an IFN antagonist has been well documented, including SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3

79

[31, 32]. Although Nsp3 proteolytic activity contributes to IFN antagonism, it is the

80

deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities of Nsp3 that are primarily responsible [32-39]. In

81

contrast, fewer examples of Nsp5 mediated disruption of host molecular pathways have been

82

identified, and all are a result of its proteolytic activity [40-43].

83

SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5 antagonism of IFN is not yet clear [31, 44, 45], but in vitro evidence

84

supports SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5 mediated cleavage of TAB1 and NLRP12 which are involved in

85

innate immunity [46]. Hundreds of potentially cleaved peptides containing the Nsp5 consensus

86

sequence appeared when lysate from human cells were incubated with recombinant Nsp5 from

87

SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, or hCoV-NL63, indicating a significant potential for Nsp5 mediated

88

disruption of host proteins [47]. Similarly, the abundance of potentially cleaved peptides

89

containing a Nsp5 consensus sequence was increased in cells infected in vitro with SARS-CoV-

90

2, which was dependent on the cell type studied [48]. Knock down or inhibition of some of these

91

human proteins likely cleaved by Nsp5, suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro, suggesting

92

that targeted host protein proteolysis is involved in viral replication [48]. Many other SARS-CoV-

93

2 Nsp5-host protein interactions have been identified using proximity labeling and co-

94

immunoprecipitation [49-54], but it is unknown if these interactions lead to Nsp5 mediated

95

cleavage. Indeed, in vitro studies may miss Nsp5-host protein interactions due to cleavage of

96

the host protein upon Nsp5 binding [49], and because individual cell types only express a limited

97

set of human proteins. A proteome-wide prediction of coronavirus Nsp5 mediated cleavage of

98

human proteins is therefore relevant to understanding COVID-19 pathogenesis, and how

99

coronaviruses in general disrupt host biology.

100

The neural network NetCorona was previously developed in 2004, and was trained on a

101

dataset of Nsp5 cleavage sites from seven coronaviruses including SARS-CoV [55]. NetCorona

102

outperforms traditional consensus motif-based approaches for identifying cleavage sites, and

103

based on the similar specificities of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5, we believed it could be

104

applied to the study of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5 interactions with human proteins. However,

105

NetCorona only analyzes the primary amino acid sequence to predict cleavage sites, which

106

lacks information about the 3D structure of the folded protein, and therefore how exposed a

107

predicted cleavage site is to a protease. In particular, the solvent accessibility of a peptide motif

108

is closely related to proteolytic susceptibility [56, 57], and in silico measurement of solvent

109

accessibility has previously been used to help predict proteolysis [58-60].

110

In this study we used NetCorona to make predictions of Nsp5 cleavage sites across the

111

entire human proteome, and additionally analyzed available protein structures in silico to identify

112

highly predicted cleavage sites. We extended this analysis to examine subcellular and tissue

113

expression patterns of the proteins predicted to be cleaved, and applied protein network

114

analysis to identify potential key pathways disrupted by Nsp5 cleavage. Predicted Nsp5

115

cleavage sites in human proteins were similar to those recently identified in vitro, and human

116

proteins predicted to be cleaved by Nsp5 were found to be involved in molecular pathways that

117

may be relevant to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease.

Results

121

Evaluating NetCorona Performance with the SARS-CoV-2 Polyprotein

122

As the NetCorona neural network was not trained on the SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein sequence

123

(Fig. 1a), we first examined if the 11 polyprotein cleavage sites homologous to SARS-CoV

124

would be correctly scored as cleaved (NetCorona score >0.5). Due to the high sequence

125

similarity with SARS-CoV, there were only three cleavage sites containing different residues

126

(Fig. 1b). The mean NetCorona score for 10 out of the 11 SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5 cleavage sites

127

was 0.859 (SD = 0.08), indicating highly predicted cleavages. The cleavage site at Nsp5-Nsp6

128

was classified as uncleaved, with a score of 0.458. SARS-CoV contains the same unique

129

phenylalanine at position P2 of Nsp5-Nsp6, but with different P1’-P3’ residues, and received a

130

marginal score of 0.607 in the original NetCorona paper [55]. Phenylalanine at P2 is not found in

131

other coronaviruses that infect humans [20, 61], nor in the other viruses used to train

132

NetCorona, which contributed to these low scores. A P2 phenylalanine may be intentionally

133

unfavorable at the Nsp5-Nsp6 cleavage site, to assist in its autoprocessing from the

134

polypeptide, by limiting the ability of the cleaved peptide’s C-terminus to bind the Nsp5 active

135

site [61]. Interestingly, the swapped identity of the P3 and P2 residues at the SARS-CoV-2

136

Nsp10-Nsp11 cleavage site resulted in a higher score versus SARS-CoV (0.865 vs 0.65), due to

137

leucine being more common at P2 versus methionine. This mutation may result in a more rapid

138

cleavage at this site in SARS-CoV-2 versus SARS-CoV, as Nsp5 favors leucine above all other

139

residues at P2 [17, 25].

140

To investigate if NetCorona can distinguish between cleaved and uncleaved motifs,

141

NetCorona scores for all glutamine motifs in the SARS-CoV-2 1ab polyprotein were also

142

determined. To gather context from the ongoing pandemic and to investigate glutamine motifs

143

across different viral variants, 8017 SARS-CoV-2 1ab polyprotein sequences obtained from

144

patient samples were scored with NetCorona (Fig. 1c, Additional File 1: Table S1). Apart from

145

two motifs present in only 40 sequences, all glutamine motifs not naturally processed by Nsp5

146

received a NetCorona score <0.5, indicating they were correctly predicted not to be cleaved.

147

Mutations at native Nsp5 cleavage sites were also rare, with only 28 such mutated cleavage

148

sites present in 63 sequences. Except for three mutations present in one sequence each,

149

mutations at native Nsp5 cleavage sites were conservative and only modestly changed the

150

NetCorona score. One sequence contained a histidine at Nsp8-Nsp9 P1 (QIO04366), resulting

151

in NetCorona not scoring the motif. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5 may be able to cleave

152

motifs with histidine at P1, albeit with reduced efficiency [17, 47].

153

These combined results indicate that despite NetCorona not being trained on the SARS-

154

CoV-2 sequence, it was able to correctly distinguish between cleaved versus uncleaved motifs

155

in the 1ab polyprotein, except for Nsp5-Nsp6. The rarity of mutated canonical cleavage sites

156

and mutations introducing new cleavage sites (0.8% and 0.5% of sequences respectively),

157

indicates stabilizing selection for a distinction between Nsp5 cleavage sites and all other

158

glutamine motifs.

159
160

NetCorona Predictions of Nsp5 Cleavage Sites in the Human Proteome

161

To generate a global view of Nsp5 cleavage sites in the human proteome, datasets were batch

162

analyzed using NetCorona (Fig. 2). Every 9-residue motif flanking a glutamine was scored,

163

where glutamine acts as P1 and four resides were analyzed on either side (P5-P4’). Using a

164

NetCorona score cutoff of >0.5, 15057 proteins (~20%) in the “All Human Proteins” dataset

165

contained a predicted cleavage site, 6056 (~29%) proteins in the “One Protein Per Gene”, and

166

2167 (~32%) proteins in the “Proteins With PDB” dataset (Additional File 1: Table S2-S4, raw

167

data sets in Additional File 2-4).

168
169

To help interpret these results, we compared the output from “One Protein Per Gene” to
proteins that have been directly tested in vitro for cleavage by a coronavirus Nsp5 protease

170

(Additional File 1: Table S5). There are six human proteins where cleavage sites have been

171

mapped to the protein sequence (GOLGA3, NEMO, NLRP12, PAICS, PNN, TAB1) [40, 46, 48],

172

and also two proteins from pigs (NEMO, STAT2) [41, 43], and one from cats (NEMO) [42].

173

NetCorona accurately scored 6 out of the 12 unique cleavage sites mapped in these proteins.

174

NetCorona struggled with an identical cleavage motif at Q231 in NEMO from cats, pigs, and

175

humans, which contains an uncommon valine at P1’. Interestingly, NetCorona predicted a

176

cleavage site in PNN at Q495, which was not identified in the original study but matches the

177

size of a reported secondary cleavage product [48].

178

Instances where NetCorona predicted cleavages but they are not observed in vitro are

179

also relevant to interpreting the full proteome results. NetCorona predicted cleavage sites in 22

180

of the 71 proteins Moustaqil et al. studied, however only TAB1 and NLRP12 were observed to

181

be cleaved by SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5 [46]. NetCorona predicted three cleavage sites in TAB1 and

182

two in NLRP12, but just one predicted site in each protein matched the mapped cleavage sites.

183

Many other potential cleavage sites have been identified by Koudelka et al. [47], where

184

N-terminomics was used to identify possible cleavage sites, after cell lysate was incubated with

185

various coronavirus Nsp5 proteases. Out of the 383 unique peptides where a glutamine was at

186

P1, NetCorona predicted that 167 (44%) of them would be cleaved (Additional File 1: Table S6).

187

Meyer et al. similarly used N-terminomics to study potential Nsp5 cleavage events, following in

188

vitro infection with SARS-CoV-2 [48]. They identified 12 motifs in human proteins that were

189

likely cleaved by Nsp5, of which NetCorona predicted 8 of these to be cleaved (Additional File 1:

190

Table S7).

191

Several SARS-CoV-2 human protein interactomes have been made available [49-54],

192

where interactions between Nsp5 and human proteins have been reported. Interactions

193

identified by Samavarchi-Therani et al. were the most numerous, and the data was well

194

annotated [51], which enabled a comparison to our results. These interaction scores, which

195

varied depending on where the BioID tag was located on Nsp5 (Nsp5 C-term, N-term, or N-term

196

on the C145A catalytically inactive mutant), were plotted against the NetCorona score from our

197

study, which is illustrated in Additional File 5: Figure S1 (raw data in Additional File 1: Table S8).

198

Although statistically significant, the negative correlation between the strength of the Nsp5-

199

human protein interaction and the maximum NetCorona score was small: ρ ranged from -0.18 to

200

-0.29, r2 ranged from 0.03 to 0.08, depending on where the BioID tag was located on Nsp5.

201

When examining only the human proteins with a positive interaction score, the mean NetCorona

202

score ranged from 0.35 to 0.38 (SD = 0.25). Thus, Nsp5-human protein interactions identified in

vitro by Samavarchi-Therani et al. did not reflect an increased likelihood of cleavage predicted

204

by NetCorona.

205
206

Structural Characterization of Predicted Nsp5 Cleavage Sites

207

We next sought to incorporate available structural information of potential protein substrates into

208

our analysis, to address the discrepancy between the cleavage events predicted by NetCorona,

209

and mapped cleavage sites that have been directly observed in vitro. The “Proteins With PDB”

210

dataset contains only human proteins that have a solved structure available in the RCSB

211

Protein Data Bank (PDB), however technical limitations for solving protein structures means that

212

certain protein domains, such as transmembrane and disordered regions, may be

213

underrepresented [62]. To investigate if the available PDB structures contained a biased

214

distribution of NetCorona scores, similarity between the distribution of NetCorona scores for

215

“Proteins With PDB” and proteins in the other two datasets was assessed through the non-

216

parametric KS test (Fig. 3a). There was insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that

217

the distribution of scores for “Proteins With PDB” proteins was equivalent to scores for “All

218

Human Proteins” and “One Protein Per Gene” (p=0.121 and p=0.856, respectively), indicating

219

that there was not significant bias in the distribution of NetCorona scores.

220

NetCorona scores are derived from the primary amino acid sequence, but targeted

221

proteolysis is also dependent on the 3D structural context of the potential substrate peptide

222

within a protein [56, 57]. Many methods have been developed to quantify this structural context

223

in silico, and solvent accessibility has been shown to be a strong predictor of proteolysis [57].

224

Accessible surface area (ASA) is commonly used to measure solvent accessibility, where a

225

probe that approximates a water molecule is rolled around the surface of the protein, and the

226

path traced out is the accessible surface [63]. Thin slices are then cut through this path, to

227

calculate the accessible surface of individual atoms. After obtaining PDB files containing motifs

228

predicted to be cleaved by NetCorona, the total ASA of each 9 amino acid motif was calculated

229

using Protein Structure and Interaction Analyzer (PSAIA) [64]. This ASA was then multiplied by

230

the motif’s NetCorona score to provide a “Nsp5 access score”, which represents both the

231

solvent accessibility and substrate sequence preference. A Nsp5 access score was obtained for

232

914 glutamine motifs in 794 unique human proteins (Additional File 1: Table S9), with the

233

process for selecting PDB files to analyze listed in Additional File 6.

234

Specific examples are presented to illustrate the utility of the Nsp5 access score (Fig.

235

3b-e). Acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) contains a motif at Q259 that was highly scored by

236

NetCorona (0.890), but due to its presence in a tightly packed beta sheet in the core of the
7

237

protein, the low ASA (38.4 Å2) results in a similarly low Nsp5 access score (34.1) and is

238

therefore unlikely to be cleaved by Nsp5 (Fig. 3b). TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAB1) is one of

239

the few human proteins with a structure and experimental evidence of SARS-CoV-2 cleavage at

240

specific sites (Q132 and Q444) [46]. As illustrated in Fig. 3c, the nearby motif at Q108 was

241

scored higher than Q132 by NetCorona, but the greater ASA of the Q132 motif contributes to a

242

higher Nsp5 access score, which matches the experimental evidence. The human protein with

243

the highest Nsp5 access score was DEAH box protein 15 (DHX15), as the motif surrounding

244

Q788 was both highly scored by NetCorona and its location proximal to the C-terminus of the

245

protein makes it highly solvent exposed (Fig. 3d).

246
247

Rationale for Nsp5 Access Score Cut-Off

248

To focus analysis on human proteins most likely to be cleaved by Nsp5, we determined a

249

relevant cut-off to the Nsp5 access score. Using available structures and homology models, the

250

Nsp5 access score of SARS-CoV-2 native cleavage sites was calculated, which ranged from

251

487 (Nsp15-Nsp16) to 923 (Nsp4-Nsp5) (Additional File 1: Table S10). The Nsp15-Nsp16 site

252

(Fig. 3e) had a surprisingly low ASA (542 Å2) versus the other SARS-CoV-2 cleavage sites

253

analyzed (mean of others 890 Å2, SD = 102 Å2), and as compared to the P5-P4’ residues of

254

known substrates of other proteases in the chymotrypsin family (mean 678 Å2, SD = 297 Å2)

255

(Additional File 1: Table S11).

256

As previously noted, NetCorona predicted cleavage sites in 22 of the 71 proteins

257

Moustaqil et al. studied, but cleavages were only observed in vitro in two proteins [46]. Nsp5

258

access scores could be provided for 9 unique motifs from the 22 proteins NetCorona predicted

259

to be cleaved, the mean of which was 332 (SD = 143). The sum of this mean and one standard

260

deviation gives a Nsp5 access score of 475. 30 cleavage sites identified in vitro by Koudelka et

261

al. could be assigned a Nsp5 access score [47], the mean of which was 381 (SD = 150). The

262

sum of this mean and one standard deviation gives a Nsp5 access score of 531.

263

Based on these comparisons to available experimental data, a Nsp5 access score cut-

264

off of 500 was selected, which is further illustrated in Additional File 7: Figure S2 (full data in

265

Additional File 1: Table S12). This cut-off accommodates motifs with marginal NetCorona

266

scores (~0.5) but maximally observed ASA (~1000 Å2), and the opposite scenario where a low

267

ASA comparable to Nsp15-Nsp16 (~500 Å2) is matched with a high NetCorona score (~0.9). 92

268

motifs in 92 human proteins were found to have a Nsp5 access score >500 (Fig. 3f), which were

269

forwarded to the next rounds of analysis.

Analysis of Tissue Expression and Subcellular Localization of Predicted Cleaved

272

Proteins

273

Proteins with a Nsp5 access score above 500 were imputed in STRING within the Cytoscape

274

environment [65-67]. The STRING app computes protein network interaction by integrating

275

information from publicly available databases, such as Reactome and Uniprot. Through

276

textmining of the articles reported in those databases, it also compiles scores for multiple

277

tissues and cellular compartment. The nucleus and cytosol were the top locations for human

278

proteins with a highly predicted Nsp5 cleavage site (Fig. 4a), and the highest expression was in

279

the nervous system and liver (Fig. 4b). The mean or summed expression score did not correlate

280

with the Nsp5 access score (ρ = 0.03 and 0.05 respectively), nor was there a correlation

281

between the Nsp5 access score and subcellular localization scores (ρ = -0.08 for mean and -

282

0.17 for sum).

283

Studies of the subcellular localization of coronavirus Nsps provide insight into where

284

Nsp5 may exist in infected cells, and thus what human proteins it may be exposed to. Flanked

285

by transmembrane proteins Nsp4 and Nsp6 in the polyprotein, Nsp5 is exposed to the cytosol

286

when first expressed, where it colocalizes with Nsp3 once released [68-70]. Recent studies

287

have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5 activity can be detected throughout the cytosol of a

288

patient’s cells ex vivo [25], and Nsp5 is also found in the nucleus and ER [51, 71].

289

Through the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), we obtained information on protein expression

290

in tissue by immunohistochemistry (IHC) together with intracellular localization obtained by

291

confocal imaging for most of the proteins in our dataset [72]. Proteins that are not found in the

292

same cellular compartment as Nsp5, or where intracellular localization was unknown, were

293

filtered out. Out of the initial 92 proteins with a Nsp5 access score over 500 and based on

294

current knowledge, only 48 proteins were likely to be found in the same cellular compartment as

295

Nsp5 (Fig. 5, Additional File 1: Table S13-14), indicating the greatest potential for interacting

296

with and being cleaved by the protease. Proteins involved in apoptosis, such as CASP2, E2F1,

297

and FNTA, had both a high Nsp5 access score and an above average expression.

Network Analysis and Pathways of Interest

300

Imputation in STRING of these 48 human proteins with a Nsp5 access score over 500 and

301

plausible colocalization, revealed multiple pathways of interest (Fig. 6, Additional File 1: Table

302

S15). The pathway containing the most proteins that may be targeted by and colocalize with

303

Nsp5 was mRNA processing (DHX15, ELAVL1, LTV1, PABPC3, RPL10, RPUSD1, SKIV2L2,

304

SMG7, TDRD7). Another prominent pathway was apoptosis, with multiple proteins involved

305

directly in apoptosis or its regulation (CASP2, E2F1, FNTA, MAPT, PTPN13). DNA damage

306

response, mediated through ATF2, NEIL1, PARP2, and RAD50 may also be targeted by Nsp5.

307

PARP2 had the second highest Nsp5 access score in our analysis, and the predicted cleavage

308

site at Q352 is located between the DNA-binding domain and the catalytic domain [73].

309

Proteins involved in membrane trafficking (RAB27B and SNX10), or in microtubule

310

organization (DNM1, HTT, MAPRE3, TSC1) were also enriched in this focused dataset, which

311

were grouped together under the descriptor “vesicle trafficking”. Two proteins related to

312

ubiquitination (UBA1 and USP4) were also amongst these potential Nsp5 targets. Nsp3

313

mediated modulation of ubiquitination has been shown to be important for IFN antagonism [32-

314

39], and there is also evidence for Nsp5 mediated reduction of ubiquitination [45, 47]. Finally, a

315

group of proteins implicated in cytokine response was also strongly predicted to be cleaved

316

(AIMP1, MAPK12, and PTPN2), which are involved in downstream signaling of multiple

317

cytokines [74-77].

Discussion

321

To provide context to the growing list of coronavirus-host protein-protein interactions, and to aid

322

in the interpretation of experiments focused on human proteins cleaved by coronavirus Nsp5,

323

we applied a bioinformatics approach to predict human proteins cleaved by Nsp5. Our

324

proteome-wide investigation compliments in vitro experiments, which are limited to only a

325

subset of potential human protein substrates based on what proteins are expressed by the cell

326

type chosen, resulting in different proteins appearing to be cleaved by [47, 48], or interact with

327

Nsp5 [49-54].

328

The NetCorona neural network generated long lists of potentially cleaved human

329

proteins, but mismatches between these predictions and the in vitro mapping of Nsp5 cleavage

330

sites indicated that NetCorona scores alone were insufficient for accurate predictions. Similar to

331

previous reports [58-60], solvent accessibility helped to filter predictions based on primary

332

sequence alone, which was made possible thanks to the PSAIA tool which automated the

333

measurement of motif ASA with an easy-to-use GUI that handled batch input of PDB files [64].

334

Human proteins predicted to be cleaved by Nsp5 did not correlate with Nsp5-human

335

protein-protein interactions identified in vitro, and Nsp5 overall appears to interact with fewer

336

human proteins compared to other Nsps and structural proteins [51]. This may be because the

337

proteolytic activity of Nsp5 reduces the efficiency of proximity labeling/affinity purification,

338

whereby Nsp5 may cleave proteins it interacts with most favorably, reducing the appearance of

339

host protein interactions. The small but statistically significant negative correlation between the

340

strength of the Nsp5-human protein interaction and the human protein’s maximum NetCorona

341

score may be evidence of this. Indeed, different sets of interacting proteins are obtained when

342

using the catalytically inactive Nsp5 mutant C145A versus the wildtype Nsp5 [49, 51, 54]. We

343

therefore hypothesize that the interactions observed by proximity labeling/affinity purification do

344

not reflect Nsp5 mediated proteolysis and instead represent non-proteolytic protein-protein

345

interactions, which may still be important to understanding Nsp5’s role in modulating host

346

protein networks.

347

N-terminomics based approaches have identified many potential Nsp5 cleavage sites in

348

human proteins [47, 48], but they have some limitations that bioinformatics can compliment.

349

Trypsin is used in the preparation of samples for mass spectrometry, which generates

350

cleavages at lysine and arginine residues that are not N-terminal to a proline. Lysine and

351

arginine appear in many cleavage sites predicted by NetCorona, meaning that cleavage by

352

trypsin may mask true cleavage sites by artificially generating a N-terminus proximal to a P1

353

glutamine residue. Only one protein overlaps between the Koudelka et al. and Meyer et al.

354

results, as these studies used different cell lines, and thus different proteins will be expressed,

355

and the methods of exposure to Nsp5 also differed (cell lysate incubated with Nsp5 vs SARS-

356

CoV-2 infection of cells) [47, 48]. Meyer et al. point out that the lysate-based method used by

357

Koudelka et al. strips proteins of their subcellular context, which may lead to observed cleavage

358

events that are not possible in vivo during infection [48]. In contrast, our bioinformatics analysis

359

is cell-type and methodology agnostic as it examined the entire human proteome. The cleavage

360

sites predicted in silico, combined with knowledge of Nsp5 subcellular localization and protein

361

networks, identified several interesting human proteins and pathways.

362

DHX15 contained a predicted cleavage site with the highest Nsp5 access score, and the

363

protein may co-localize with Nsp5 in the nuclei of infected cells, making it a significant protein of

364

interest. DHX15 is a DExD/H-box helicase, a family of proteins that serves to detect foreign

365

RNA, triggering an antiviral response (reviewed by [78]). The role of DHX15 in anti-viral defense

366

is diverse, including by binding viral RNA with NLRP6, which activates Type I/III interferons and

367

IFN-stimulated genes in the intestine of mice [79]. DHX15 mediated sensing of viral RNA

368

activates MAPK and NK-κB innate immune signaling [80], and also acts as a coreceptor of viral

369

RNA with RIG-I that increases antiviral response and cytokine production [81].

370
371

DHX15 is not reported to be a significant interactor with SARS-CoV-2 proteins [51],
however it is capable of binding both dsRNA and ssRNA [81], suggesting it could bind

372

coronavirus ssRNA. The location of the predicted Nsp5 cleavage site (Q788) is very close to its

373

C-terminus (Y795), so cleavage by Nsp5 would remove only seven amino acids. However, there

374

is a SUMOylation site (K786) at P3 of the cleavage motif, and the de-SUMOylation of DHX15

375

results in increased antiviral signaling [82]. Therefore, it is possible that Nsp5 cleavage at Q788

376

may disrupt SUMOylation, by reducing the length of the peptide accessible by the SUMOylation

377

complex, contributing to the general dysregulation of a coordinated innate immune response to

378

viral infection.

379

PARP2 contained a predicted Nsp5 cleavage site with the second highest Nsp5 access

380

score, at Q352. PARP2 is involved in DNA damage recognition and repair, and its correct

381

functioning prevents apoptosis in the event of a double stranded break (DSB) [83]. PARP2 also

382

plays a role in the adaptive immune system, as it helps prevent the accumulation of DSBs

383

during TCRα gene rearrangements in thymocytes, promoting T-cell maturation [84]. The

384

predicted Nsp5 site occurs between the DNA binding and catalytic domains of PARP2 [85],

385

meaning the cleaved protein would be unable to recognize damaged DNA, contributing to

386

apoptosis. Interestingly, this is similar to the native activity of human caspase-8, which cleaves

387

PARP2 in its DNA binding domain during apoptosis [86]. SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung

388

epithelial cells was found to increase caspase-8 activity, resulting in cleaved PARP1, a homolog

389

of PARP2 [87]. SARS-CoV Nsp5 activity is known to be pro-apoptotic, via the activation of

390

caspase-3 and caspase-9 [88]. Overall, if coronavirus Nsp5 cleaves PARP2, it could contribute

391

to the pro-apoptotic cell state observed in infected cells.

392

Proteins with roles in cytokine response and antiviral defense were also identified as

393

strongly predicted targets of Nsp5 cleavage (AIMP1, MAPK12, PTPN2). AIMP1 is crucial to

394

antiviral defense in mice [74], and it is targeted for degradation by hepatitis C virus envelope

395

protein E2 [75]. MAPK12 function appears to be important for SARS-CoV-2 replication, as

396

knockdown by siRNA results in lower virus titers [76]. This phenotype is similar to the

397

knockdown of Nsp5 targeted proteins resulting in lower virus replication, as observed by Meyer

398

et al. [48]. T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTPN2, negatively regulates the antiviral

399

response of MITA [89] and the JAK-STAT pathway of the innate immune system [90]. Knockout

400

of PTPN2 results in systemic inflammatory responses in mice resulting in premature death [91],

401

and a genetic polymorphism resulting in PTPN2 loss of function increases ACE2 expression,

402

resulting in greater susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection [77].

403

The modulation of mRNA processing, DNA damage recognition/apoptosis, and cytokine

404

signaling stood out as the most interesting pathways that may be influenced by Nsp5 cleavage.

405

As coronaviruses are known to bias mRNA processing, trigger apoptosis, and disrupt innate

406

immune responses (reviewed by [15]), these results suggest that Nsp5 mediated cleavage may

407

aid in the molecular pathogenesis of diseases caused by coronaviruses diseases. These

408

pathways, and specific proteins mentioned above, represent interesting targets for further

409

analysis in vitro.

410
411
412

Limitations

413

Recent studies comparing Nsp5 proteases from various coronaviruses have indicated that

414

despite sharing significant sequence and structural similarity, they cleave and interact with

415

different human proteins in vitro [47, 54]. In general, a pan-coronavirus predictor of Nsp5

416

cleavage sites may not be feasible. For example, SARS-CoV-2 Nsp5 accommodates more

417

diversity at P2 than SARS-CoV Nsp5 [25], which would influence the human proteins that could

418

be cleaved. Refinements to the NetCorona neural network to improve its predictive accuracy, or

419

make them virus-specific, would be beneficial and have recently been attempted [92]. Nsp5 also

420

likely accommodates more diversity at P1’ and P3 than what NetCorona was trained on, based

421

on the naturally occurring 1ab variants we report here, and the human proteins observed to be

422

cleaved in vitro. That histidine can be accommodated at P1 and phenylalanine at P2, albeit

423

unfavorably, further adds complexity to what human proteins may be cleaved by Nsp5 [17, 25,

424

47, 61]. The results of this study are instead meant to provide guidance for in vitro experimental

425

design and interpretation of experimental results, in addition to suggesting proteome-wide

426

trends in molecular pathways that Nsp5 mediated cleavage may disrupt.

427
428
429

Conclusions

430

The large volume of recent coronavirus research and data requires proteome-wide views of

431

interpretation. The results of this study are intended to compliment the various in vitro

432

approaches that have been used to identify Nsp5-human protein interactions, and to map

433

specific Nsp5 cleavage sites in human proteins. As Meyer et al. discuss, specific targeting of

434

proteins by Nsp5 appears likely, as the knockdown of certain Nsp5-targeted proteins reduces

435

viral reproduction [48]. We have built upon the original NetCorona study by performing detailed

436

structural analysis of predicted cleavage sites, and protein network and pathway analysis.

437

Coronavirus Nsp5 was predicted to play a role in the targeted disruption of mRNA processing,

cytokine response, and apoptosis, which are interesting targets for future analysis and

439

characterization. We hope that our analysis and the proteome-wide datasets generated will aid

440

in the interpretation and design of additional experiments towards understanding Nsp5’s role in

441

coronavirus molecular pathology.

Methods

445

Amino Acid Sequence Datasets

446

Three datasets of amino acid sequences of human proteins were downloaded from the UniProt

447

reference human proteome on April 14 2020: “All Human Proteins” contains 74811 human

448

protein sequences including splice variants and predicted proteins; “One Protein Per Gene”

449

contains 20595 human protein sequences where only one sequence is provided for each gene;

450

“Proteins With PDB” is the “All Human Proteins” dataset filtered in UniProt for associated entries

451

in the RCSB Protein Data Bank, generating a dataset of 6806 human protein sequences. 9404

452

amino acid sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 1ab polyprotein were obtained from NCBI Virus on

453

August 4 2020. Sequences with inconclusive “X” residues were filtered out as they were not

454

correctly handled by NetCorona, leaving 8017 SARS-CoV-2 1ab polyprotein sequences to be

455

analyzed.

456
457

NetCorona Analysis

458

The command line version of NetCorona was used to predict Nsp5 cleavage site scores for

459

human and viral protein sequences [55]. To overcome the input file limit of 50,000 amino acids

460

per submission and handle sequences with non-standard amino acids, a Python script was

461

developed. This script partitions the input data, runs the NetCorona neural network on each

462

subset, and parses and concatenates the output data. The output file includes sequence

463

accession number, position of P1-Glutamine (Q) residue, Netcorona score (0.000-1.000) and a

464

10 amino acid sequence motif of positions P5-P5’ (Additional File 2-4). Note that the neural

465

network itself uses positions P5-P4’ (9 residues) for calculating the score. Gene names and

466

other identifiers associated with each UniProt ID containing a NetCorona score >0.5 were

467

collected in Microsoft Excel (Additional File 1: Table S2-S4). Scores from NetCorona run on

468

each dataset of proteins were parsed and compared with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, to

469

assess the null hypothesis that the scores for each population are drawn from the same

470

distribution. Unique glutamine motifs from 1ab polyprotein sequences were identified using

472

was performed using GraphPad Prism (version 9.1.0)

473
474

Structural Analysis

475

PDB metadata associated with proteins in the “Proteins With PDB” dataset that also contained a

476

predicted Nsp5 cleavage (NetCorona score >0.5), were downloaded from the RCSB PDB

477

website by generating a custom report in .csv format. Homology models, and structures with a

478

resolution greater than 8Å or where resolution was not reported, were removed. Nsp5 cleavage

479

sites predicted by NetCorona were matched with one PDB file per cleavage site, by searching

480

the PDB metadata for the predicted 9 amino acid cleavage motif using Microsoft Excel

481

(Additional File 6). The entire predicted 9 amino acid motif must appear in the PDB file to be

482

considered a match. Matches between a PDB file and predicted cleavage motif were manually

483

corrected when the motif sequence appeared by chance in a PDB containing the incorrect

484

protein.

485

PDB files containing a predicted Nsp5 cleavage site were then batch downloaded from

486

the RCSB PDB, and analyzed 100 at a time using the Protein Structure and Interaction Analyzer

487

(PSAIA) tool using default settings [64], with chains in each PDB analyzed independently. The

488

total accessible surface area (ASA) of each residue was calculated using a Z slice of 0.25 Å and

489

a probe radius of 1.4 Å. XML files output by PSAIA were combined in Microsoft Excel, to create

490

searchable datasets for each 9 amino acid motif predicted to be cleaved by NetCorona, and the

491

total ASA of all atoms in each 9 amino acid motif were summed. The motif’s ASA was then

492

multiplied by the NetCorona score to provide a Nsp5 access score.

493

Proteins known to be cleaved by mammalian chymotrypsin-like proteases were

494

independently obtained from the RCSB PDB, and the known cleaved motifs were analyzed as

495

above. Protein structures and homology models of SARS-CoV-2 proteins were obtained the

496

RCSB PDB and from SWISS-MODEL [93] and were analyzed as above. Publication quality

497

figures were generated using PyMOL 2.3.0.

Tissue Expression and Subcellular Localization Analysis

500

Proteins with Nsp5 access score above 500 were loaded into the STRING app [65] within

501

Cytoscape [66] (version 1.6.0 and 3.8.2 respectively) using Uniprot ID, Homo sapiens

502

background, 0.80 confidence score cut-off and no additional interactor for the pathway

504

expression scores and compartments score for each protein) was exported to R for wrangling

505

and data visualization using the tidyverse and ggrepel packages [94-96].

506

To increase confidence, tissue expression and subcellular localization data were

507

obtained from the Human Protein Atlas which are all based on immunohistochemistry (tissue

508

expression) or confocal microscopy (subcellular localization) [72, 97]. Each entry was then

509

matched in R, table joining was done using Uniprot IDs. Expression levels noted as “Not

510

detected”, “Low”, “Medium” or “High” were replaced by numeric values ranging from 0 to 3.

511

Mean expression was calculated as the mean expression across all tissues, removing missing

512

values from the analysis.

513

The following intracellular locations were used to encompass the nucleus, cytoplasm

514

and endoplasmic reticulum: "Cytosol", "Nucleoplasm", "Endoplasmic reticulum", "Microtubules",

515

"Nuclear speckles", "Intermediate filaments", "Nucleoli", "Nuclear bodies". All the proteins that

516

did not include one or more of these locations in the HPA database were excluded from further

517

analysis.

518
519

Protein Network Analysis

520

The 48 proteins with a Nsp5 access score >500 and that had the potential to be found in the

521

same cellular compartment as Nsp5 were imported into the STRING app (again within

522

Cytoscape) while allowing a maximum of 5 additional interactor for the network generation

523

instead of none. All the other parameters were left unchanged. Individual nodes that had no

524

protein-protein interactions with other proteins in the network were manually moved closer to

525

other nodes presenting the same or similar pathway. When proteins could interact in multiple

526

pathways represented here, a “main pathway” was assigned based on literature search. Node

527

color was a gradient based on Nsp5 access score. Node size increased with the mean

528

expression. Edges represent protein-protein interaction (confidence > 0.80). Gene name labels

529

were colored based on the Nsp5 access acore for readability only.

Fig. 2 Overview of approach to predicting Nsp5 cleavage sites in human proteins. Three

817

datasets of human protein sequences were analyzed by the NetCorona neural network.

818

NetCorona assigned scores (0 – 1.0) to the 9 amino acid motif surrounding every glutamine

819

residue in the datasets, where a score >0.5 was inferred to be a possible cleavage site. PDB

820

files associated with predicted cleaved proteins were analyzed using the Protein Structure and

821

Interaction Analyzer (PSAIA) tool, which output the accessible surface area (ASA) of each

822

predicted 9 amino acid cleavage motif. Proteins with highly predicted Nsp5 cleavage sites were

823

then analyzed using STRING, which provided information on tissue expression, subcellular

824

localization, and performed protein network analysis. Human proteins and molecular pathways

825

of interest containing a predicted Nsp5 cleavage site were then flagged for potential

826

physiological relevance.

Fig. 3 Structural analysis of predicted and known Nsp5 cleavage motifs. (a) NetCorona

831

scores are shown for all P5-P4’ motifs surrounding glutamine residues in three datasets of

832

human proteins, binned by score differences of 0.01. The distributions of scores were not

833

statistically different from one another. (b) Despite a high NetCorona score in ACHE, the motif’s

834

location in the core of the protein leads to a low Nsp5 access score. (c) TAB1 contains several

835

motifs predicted to be cleaved, including at Q108 and Q132. The Nsp5 access score is slightly

836

higher for the Q132 motif due to the greater accessible surface area (ASA). (d) DHX15 contains

837

the motif with the highest Nsp5 access score observed in the human proteins studied, located

838

on the C-terminus of the protein. (e) SARS-CoV-2 proteins Nsp15 and Nsp16 contain the native

839

Nsp5 cleavage motif with the lowest Nsp5 access score calculated (487), which helped provide

840

a cut-off to Nsp5 access scores in human proteins. (f) The Nsp5 access score of human protein

841

motifs are indicated, binned by score differences of 50. 92 motifs in 92 unique human proteins

842

have a Nsp5 access score >500.
