Abstract

20

Replication-restricted modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is a licensed smallpox vaccine and

21

numerous clinical studies investigating recombinant MVAs (rMVAs) as vectors for prevention

22

of other infectious diseases have been completed or are in progress. Two rMVA COVID-19

23

vaccine trials are at an initial stage, though no animal protection studies have been reported.

24

Here, we characterize rMVAs expressing the S protein of CoV-2. Modifications of full length S

25

individually or in combination included two proline substitutions, mutations of the furin

26

recognition site and deletion of the endoplasmic retrieval signal. Another rMVA in which the

27

receptor binding domain (RBD) flanked by the signal peptide and transmembrane domains of S

28

was also constructed. Each modified S protein was displayed on the surface of rMVA-infected

29

human cells and was recognized by anti-RBD antibody and by soluble hACE2 receptor.

30

Intramuscular injection of mice with the rMVAs induced S-binding and pseudovirus-neutralizing

31

antibodies. Boosting occurred following a second homologous rMVA but was higher with

32

adjuvanted purified RBD protein. Weight loss and lethality following intranasal infection of

33

transgenic hACE2 mice with CoV-2 was prevented by one or two immunizations with rMVAs or

34

by passive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice. One or two rMVA vaccinations also

35

prevented recovery of infectious CoV-2 from the lungs. A low amount of virus was detected in

36

the nasal turbinates of only one of eight rMVA-vaccinated mice on day 2 and none later.

37

Detection of subgenomic mRNA in turbinates on day 2 only indicated that replication was

38

abortive in immunized animals.

Significance

42

Vaccines are required to control COVID-19 during the pandemic and possibly afterwards.

43

Recombinant nucleic acids, proteins and virus vectors that stimulate immune responses to the

44

CoV-2 S protein have provided protection in experimental animal or human clinical trials,

45

though questions remain regarding their ability to prevent spread and the duration of immunity.

46

The present study focuses on replication-restricted modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA),

47

which has been shown to be a safe, immunogenic and stable smallpox vaccine and a promising

48

vaccine vector for other infectious diseases and cancer. In a transgenic mouse model, one or two

49

injections of recombinant MVAs that express modified forms of S inhibited CoV-2 replication in

50

the upper and lower respiratory tracts and prevented severe disease.

Introduction

53

Recombinant DNA methods have revolutionized the engineering of vaccines against microbial

54

pathogens, thereby creating opportunities to control the current SARS CoV-2 pandemic (1). The

55

main categories of recombinant vaccines are protein, nucleic acid (DNA and RNA), virus vectors

56

(replicating and non-replicating) and genetically modified live viruses. Each approach has

57

distinctive advantages and drawbacks with regard to manufacture, stability, cold-chain

58

requirements, mode of inoculation, and immune stimulation. Recombinant proteins have been

59

successfully deployed as hepatitis B, papilloma, influenza and varicella Zoster virus vaccines (2-

60

5). DNA vaccines have been licensed to protect horses from West Nile virus and salmon from

61

infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (6, 7), though none are in regular human use. Recently

62

developed mRNA vaccines received emergency approval for COVID-19 and are in pre-clinical

63

development for other infectious diseases (8). At least 12 virus vector vaccines based on

64

adenovirus, fowlpox virus, vaccinia virus (VACV) and yellow fever virus have veterinary

65

applications, but so far only an attenuated yellow fever vectored Dengue and a chimeric Japanese

66

encephalitis virus vaccine have been marketed for humans (9), though numerous clinical trials

67

particularly with attenuated adenovirus and VACV are listed in ClinicalTrials.gov.

68

A variety of recombinant approaches utilizing the spike (S) protein as immunogen are

69

being explored to quell the SARS CoV-2 pandemic (10). Vaccines based on mRNA and

70

adenovirus have demonstrated promising results in animal models as well as in clinical trials and

71

some have already received emergency regulatory approval (11-14). Other vaccines, including

72

ones based on vesicular stomatitis virus (15), an alphavirus-derived replicon RNA (16), and an

73

inactivated recombinant New Castle Disease virus (17) have shown protection in animal models.

74

Immunogenicity in mice was found for a modified VACV Ankara (MVA)-based CoV-2 vaccine

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.30.424878; this version posted January 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

(18), but animal protection studies have not yet been reported. However, protection has been

76

obtained with related MVA-based SARS CoV-1 and MERS in animals (19-22) and a MVA

77

MERS vaccine was shown to be safe and immunogenic in a phase 1 clinical trial (23).

78

Experiments with virus vectors for vaccination were carried out initially with VACV (24,

79

25), providing a precedent for a multitude of other virus vectors (9). The majority of current

80

VACV vaccine studies employ the MVA strain, which was attenuated by passage more than 500

81

times in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) during which numerous genes were deleted or

82

mutated resulting in an inability to replicate in human and most other mammalian cells (26).

83

Despite the inability to complete a productive infection, MVA is capable of highly expressing

84

recombinant genes and inducing immune responses (27, 28). MVA is a licensed smallpox

85

vaccine and numerous clinical studies of recombinant MVA (rMVA) vectors are in progress or

86

have been completed and two for COVID-19 are in the recruiting phase (ClinicalTrials.gov).

87

Here, we show that one or two immunizations with rMVAs expressing SARS CoV-2 spike

88

proteins elicit strong neutralizing antibody responses, induce CD8+ T-cells and protect

89

susceptible transgenic mice against a lethal intranasal challenge with CoV-2 virus, supporting

90

clinical testing of related rMVA vaccines.

Results

93

Construction of rMVAs and expression of S proteins. The full-length CoV-2 S protein

94

contains 1273 amino acids (aa) comprising a signal peptide (aa 1-13), the S1 receptor binding

95

subunit (aa 14-685) and the S2 membrane fusion subunit (aa 686-1273). A panel of rMVAs with

96

names in italics including WT expressing unmodified CoV-2 S (GenBank: QHU36824) and

97

modified forms of the S protein with C-terminal FLAG tags were engineered (Fig. 1). The

98

rMVAs with modified versions of full-length S include 2P with two proline substitutions (K986P,

99

V987P) intended to stabilize the prefusion conformation (11, 29-31), Dfurin with perturbation of

100

the furin recognition site (RRAR682-685GSAS) to prevent cleavage of S, DERRS with deletion of

101

the last 19 aa including the endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signal and Tri with a combination of

102

all three modifications. RBD, another rMVA, contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) and

103

contiguous sequences preceded by the S signal peptide and followed by the transmembrane

104

domain of S. The latter were added because a previous study with an unrelated protein

105

demonstrated that membrane anchoring strongly enhances immunogenicity of a VACV vector

106

(32) and also enhanced immunogenicity of CoV-2 S expressed by an mRNA vaccine (11). The

107

additional rMVAs, D614G and a 2P version, express S with amino acid changes of a recently

108

emerged strain (33). VACV transcription termination signals that could reduce early expression

109

(34) and runs of four or more consecutive Gs or Cs that could accelerate the occurrence of

110

deletions (35) were altered by making silent mutations.

111

DNA encoding the modified S open reading frames (ORFs) were inserted into the

112

pLW44 transfer vector (36), which provides a VACV early/late promoter and flanking sequences

113

that enable directed recombination into a non-essential region of the MVA genome and selection

114

of plaques in CEF by green fluorescence. After multiple rounds of plaque purification, the

115

sequences of WT and modified S ORFs were confirmed and the viruses were expanded in CEF

116

and purified by sedimentation through a sucrose cushion.

117

Since CoV-2 vaccines are intended for humans, in which replication of MVA is

118

restricted, HeLa cells were used to evaluate expression of the S proteins during a single round of

119

infection. Cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western

120

blotting. Full-length S proteins of ~180 kDa or a ~50 kDa shortened version in the case of RBD,

121

were detected by antibodies to the RBD (Fig. 2A) and to the C-terminal FLAG tag (Fig. 2B). The

122

anti-RBD antibody also recognized S1, formed by cleavage of full-length S, from lysates of cells

123

infected with WT, D614G and their 2P versions but only a small amount from DERRS and none

124

from Dfurin or Tri, both of which have deletions of the furin recognition site (Fig. 2A). Similarly,

125

S2 was detected by anti-FLAG antibody in lysates from cells infected with WT, D614G and their

126

2P versions but not from Dfurin- or Tri (Fig. 2B). Relatively small amounts of possibly

127

aggregated higher molecular weight S was detected by anti-FLAG antibody in cells infected with

128

WT and D614G (Fig. 2B).

129

Expression of the S proteins in HeLa cells that were infected with the rMVAs was also

130

evaluated by flow cytometry. After permeabilization, virtually 100% of infected cells

131

distinguished by GFP fluorescence were stained by a mouse anti-RBD mAb (Fig. 2C). In the

132

absence of permeabilization, nearly 100% of the cells expressing full length S and nearly 90%

133

expressing the RBD were stained indicating cell surface expression (Fig. 2D). Control

134

experiments with unmodified parental MVA demonstrated no significant staining with or

135

without permeabilization.

136

Human angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE2) is a cell receptor for CoV-2 (1, 37). The

137

binding of soluble hACE2 to S proteins expressed on the surface of cells infected with rMVAs

138

was analyzed as an indication of their appropriate folding. Binding of hACE2 to all constructs is

139

shown in histograms (Fig. S1). The mean fluorescence intensities of S-expressing cells were

140

similar except for the slightly higher value with Dfurin and Tri (Fig. 2E). We concluded that the

141

WT and modified S proteins were all highly expressed on the surface of infected HeLa cells and

142

potentially capable of eliciting immune responses.

144

Binding and neutralizing antibodies induced by rMVAs. To compare their immunogenicity,

145

each rMVA was inoculated intramuscularly (IM) into BALB/c mice at 0 time and again at 3

146

weeks. Some mice received purified RBD protein in QS21 adjuvant for priming and boosting or

147

as a boost for mice primed with an rMVA. Binding antibody was measured by ELISA, using

148

wells coated with purified 2P-stabilized S protein, at 3 weeks after the prime and 2 weeks after

149

the boost. Binding antibodies were detected after the first immunization in all cases and

150

increased by more than 1 log following a boost with the same vector (Fig. 3A, B). The ELISA

151

titers for immunizations with all rMVAs were similar. Lesser binding, representing cross-

152

reactivity, was obtained with sera from mice immunized with rMVA expressing the CoV-1 S

153

(Fig. 3A) (19) and no binding above the base line was detected with sera from mice immunized

154

with the parental MVA (Fig. 3A, B). Sera from mice immunized with the RBD protein and

155

adjuvant exhibited low or no binding to S after the prime and more than a log less binding than

156

any of the rMVAs expressing S after boosting with the same protein (Fig. 3A). Nevertheless, the

157

RBD protein effectively boosted mice primed with rMVAs (Fig. 3A, B). The inability of RBD

158

protein to induce binding antibody in naive mice was probably due to low immunogenicity of a

159

soluble protein rather than to the truncation of the S sequence since the titer obtained after one

160

vaccination with RBD, which encodes a membrane bound version, was similar to titers obtained

161

with full-length S (Fig. 3B).

162

Neutralizing titers of the serum samples from BALB/c mice were determined using a

163

lentiviral pseudotype assay (11, 38). Low or no neutralization was detected at 3 weeks after

164

priming but increased markedly at 2 weeks after the rMVA boosts to mean levels of ~103 NT50

165

(Fig. 3C, D). The RBD protein boosts elicited NT50 titers that were consistently higher than the

166

rMVA boosts. Three samples of patient sera that had reference CoV-2 NT50 titers of 1280, 320

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.30.424878; this version posted January 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

167

and 320 were found to have pseudovirus NT50 titers of 3209, 370 and 482, respectively. Thus,

168

the rMVAs produced neutralizing antibody that was in the high range for patient sera.

169

We also determined binding and neutralization antibodies in sera from C57BL/6 mice

170

that were immunized with 2P and Tri and boosted with the same rMVAs or with RBD protein.

171

Both the mean binding and neutralization titers were consistently higher in sera of C57BL/6 mice

172

compared to BALB/c mice (Fig. 3E, F). The difference between the mouse strains was most

173

significant for the neutralization titer after the primes (p<0.001). A time course indicated that

174

binding and neutralizing antibody increased greatly between 1 and 3 weeks after the first

175

immunization in C57BL/6 mice (Fig. S2). An additional experiment showed that soluble S

176

proteins and RBD from a variety of sources boosted binding and neutralizing antibodies in

177

C57BL/6 mice (Fig. S3).

178

High ratios of IgG2a and IgG2c to IgG1 in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, respectively, is

179

indicative of a Th1 type anti-viral response (39). We determined the IgG subclasses of S-specific

180

antibodies induced by an MVA-based vector and by RBD protein administered with QS21

181

adjuvant. The subclasses were determined by ELISA in which serum samples from vaccinated

182

mice were added to 96-well plates that had immobilized full-length S. Following this, isotype

183

specific secondary antibodies conjugated to horse radish peroxidase (HRP) were added. Table 1

184

shows that BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice that were primed and boosted by rMVA 2P made IgG1,

185

IgG2b, IgG2a or IgG2c and IgG3, but no detectable IgA antibody. The highest values were to

186

IgG2a and IgG2c in BALB/c and C57BL/6, respectively (40, 41). The isotypes produced in the

187

hACE2 mice, which were backcrossed to C57BL/6 and used in a later section of the paper, were

188

similar to that of C57BL/6. However, the biggest difference was between the RBD protein prime

189

and boost and immunizations with rMVA (Table 1). The protein only immunizations elicited a

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.30.424878; this version posted January 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

190

predominance of IgG1 giving a clear Th2 response. Nevertheless, the RBD protein following

191

rMVA 2P boosted the Th1 response in both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice.

192
193

Stimulation of Specific T cells. An ex vivo stimulation protocol was used to identify T cells

194

specific for S following immunization. The sequences of an array of CoV-2 S peptides obtained

195

from BEI Resources were compared to peptides that were previously found to be positive (42).

196

As the peptides were not identical in the two libraries, we tested peptide pools for their ability to

197

stimulate CD3+CD8+IFNg+ and CD3+CD4+IFNg+ T cells from spleens of BALB/c mice that

198

had been immunized with parental MVA and rMVA WT expressing CoV-2 S. The two S peptide

199

pools with highest specific activity were #4 and #7, which contained peptides from the NTD and

200

RBD portions of S1, respectively (Fig. 4A). None of the pools had high CD4+IFNg+ specific

201

activity for the rMVA expressing S. A similar screen was carried out with spleen cells derived

202

from immunized C57BL/6 mice. Pool #7 was again most positive for CD8+INFg+ T cells,

203

whereas other pools showed less specific activity (Fig. 4B).

204

Next, we compared the percentages of splenic CD8+IFNg+ T cells following priming

205

with several different rMVA S constructs followed by homologous rMVA or RBD protein

206

boosts. Spleen cells from mice immunized with parental MVA lacking S sequences and spleen

207

cells that were not stimulated with peptide served as negative controls. Following priming and

208

homologous boosting, peptide pool #7 stimulated T cells from mice immunized with each of the

209

rMVA S constructs (Fig. 4C). A similar result was obtained with peptides from pool #4. In

210

comparison, the CD8+IFNg+ T cell numbers following boosts with RBD protein were much

211

lower after stimulation with pool #4 or #7 than after rMVA boosts (Fig. 4C). The same pattern

212

occurred in C57BL/6 T cells: the homologous prime boosts with 2P and Tri were higher than

213

with RBD protein boosts (Fig. 4D). To better understand the difference between the boosts with

214

MVA vectors and protein, we determined the duration of the T cells response following priming

215

with MVA vectors. A dramatic drop in CD8+IFNg+ T cell numbers occurred between 1 and 3

216

weeks (Fig. 4E), indicating a requirement for boosting by an MVA vector to restore elevated T

217

cells.

218
219

Protection against Intranasal (IN) CoV-2 infection. Transgenic mice that express hACE2

220

regulated by the cytokeratin 18 (K18) gene promoter (K18-hACE2) (43) are highly susceptible

221

to IN CoV-2 infection (44). High levels of virus are present in the lungs within a few days and

222

severe weight loss occurs by day 5 or 6 with animals becoming moribund. In our experiments,

223

hACE2 transgenic mice were immunized by IM inoculation with 2P or Tri and boosted 3 weeks

224

later with the homologous rMVA or with RBD protein in adjuvant (Fig. 5A). Control mice were

225

unvaccinated (naive) or primed and boosted with the parental MVA lacking CoV-2 sequences.

226

Binding antibody to full length S was detected 3 weeks after the 2P and Tri primes and was

227

boosted up to 10-fold with homologous or protein boosts (Fig. 5B). Isotype analysis indicated

228

that the binding antibody was IgG2c > IgG2b > IgG1 > IgG3 and no detectable IgA (Table 1),

229

indicating a strong Th1 response in the mice receiving 2P or Tri and homologous or

230

heterologous boosts. In contrast to binding antibody, CoV-2 neutralizing antibody was boosted

231

by RBD protein but not appreciably by the rMVAs (Fig. 5C). To help explain the latter results,

232

we compared the MVA neutralizing antibodies of hACE2 mice after priming and boosting with

233

rMVA 2P as well as after boosting with RBD protein. The 2P prime elicited high MVA

234

neutralizing antibody, which was increased by more than a log after the homologous boost but

235

not by the RBP protein boost (Fig. S4). We suspect that the primary antibody response to the

236

rMVA attenuated the subsequent MVA infection and that the boost in MVA neutralizing

237

antibody and CoV-2 S binding antibody were due in part to the virus particles and associated

238

membranes of the virus inoculum. Boosting with the RBD protein, however, was not attenuated

239

by priming with the rMVA and stimulated a strong anamnestic response to CoV-2 S.

240

At 2 weeks after the boosts, the hACE2 mice were infected IN with 1x105 TCID50 of

241

CoV-2. The naive and parental MVA immunized mice lost weight by day 5 and were moribund

242

on day 6 (Fig. 5D). The similarity between the two controls indicated that non-specific innate

243

immune responses due to the parental MVA were not significantly protective at the time of

244

challenge. In contrast, regardless of the boost, the rMVA vaccinated mice lost no weight and

245

appeared healthy throughout the experiment. The surviving mice were re-challenged with CoV-2

246

after 2 weeks and again showed no weight loss, whereas additional naive mice succumbed to the

247

virus infection by day 6 (Fig. 5E).

248

The lungs of naive and parental MVA immunized control mice had high titers of

249

infectious CoV-2 on day 2, which dropped slightly on day 5, whereas no infectious virus was

250

found in any of the 16 rMVA vaccinated mice at either time regardless of the prime or boost

251

(Fig. 5F). The virus titers in the nasal turbinates of control mice peaked at day 2 but were still

252

elevated at day 5 (Fig. 5G). In contrast, only one rMVA vaccinated mouse had a low level of

253

virus in the turbinates that was more than 2 logs lower than controls on day 2 and none had

254

detectable virus on day 5.

255

Subgenomic N and S mRNAs were analyzed by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) using

256

specific primers to distinguish newly synthesized RNA from input viral RNA. High levels of N

257

and S mRNA were found in lungs of both control groups on days 2 and 5 (Fig. 5H). In contrast S

abundant N mRNA was barely detected in a few animals at 4.5 to 5 logs lower than controls on

260

day 2 and none on day 5 (Fig. 5H). N and S mRNAs were also detected in the nasal turbinates of

261

control mice on both days but had decreased about a log between the two times (Fig. 5I). In

262

rMVA vaccinated mice, N and S mRNAs were only detected on day 2 and the amounts were 43-

263

and 85-fold lower, respectively, than the controls. Statistical significance (p<0.004) was

264

determined by combining the values for N mRNAs on day 2 from both control groups and

265

comparing that to the combined values from all rMVA vaccinated mice. The same p value was

266

obtained when the S mRNAs were compared. Neither N nor S mRNA was detected in the nasal

267

turbinates of any of the rMVA vaccinated mice on day 5. Thus, all rMVA vaccinated mice

268

exhibited a high degree of protection against CoV-2 regardless of whether they were primed with

269

2P or Tri and boosted with the homologous rMVA or RBD protein.

270
271

Single vaccination. The similar levels of neutralizing antibody after priming and boosting with

272

2P and Tri, led us to investigate whether a single rMVA vaccination would be sufficient to

273

protect hACE2 mice against an intranasal challenge with CoV-2. The hACE2 mice were

274

vaccinated with parental MVA or Tri and challenged 3 weeks later. Prior to challenge, the

275

elevated binding and neutralizing antibody levels (Fig. 6A, B) were consistent with previous

276

experiments. Following IN administration of CoV-2, mice that received the parental MVA

277

suffered severe weight loss and became moribund, whereas the mice that received Tri remained

278

healthy (Fig. 6C). Moreover, no infectious CoV-2 or subgenomic N or S mRNA was detected in

279

lungs or nasal turbinates of the rMVA vaccinated mice on day 5 (Fig. 6D-F).

Protection of hACE2 mice by passive transfer of serum. A passive transfer experiment was

282

carried out to determine whether antibody induced by vaccination with rMVA S vectors is

283

sufficient to protect against lethal infection with CoV-2. Sera were pooled from mice that had

284

been vaccinated by priming and boosting with parental MVA or rMVA expressing WT S.

285

Aliquots were injected into the peritoneum of hACE2 mice, which were challenged with CoV-2

286

approximately 24 h later. A few hours before the challenge, the mice were bled and the

287

pseudotype neutralizing titers of 160 NT50 were found for each of the mice that received the

288

immune serum, well below the titers of mice that received rMVA vaccinations. Nevertheless, the

289

mice showed no signs of weight loss or ill health following inoculation of CoV-2 (Fig. 6G).

290
291

Discussion

292

The CoV-2 S protein is the major target of neutralizing antibodies. In an attempt to optimize the

293

synthesis and immunogenicity of S, we constructed a panel of rMVAs that expressed unmodified

294

S or S with one or multiple modifications. However, little or no difference was found in the cell

295

surface expression of the variant forms of S and each of the rMVAs stimulated similar levels of

296

antibody that bound S in an ELISA and neutralized a CoV-2 S pseudotype virus. A common

297

feature of all the rMVAs was surface expression of the RBD as shown by interaction with an

298

anti-RBD mAb and soluble hACE2.

299

Isotype analysis indicated that the rMVAs induced a well-balanced predominantly Th1

300

type response with IgG2a or IgG2c (depending on the mouse strain) > IgG2b > IgG1 > IgG3,

301

which is the usual order following a viral infection and by IFNg stimulation (45-47). IgG2a,

302

IgG2b and IgG2c have similar functions and are able to fix complement and activate Fc

303

receptors to promote virus clearance, whereas IgG1 may limit inflammation (47). Lower levels

304

of binding and neutralizing antibodies were detected following priming and boosting with

305

purified soluble RBD protein in QS21 adjuvant. In addition, IgG1 was predominant when mice

306

were immunized with RBD protein. Nevertheless, higher binding and neutralizing titers were

307

obtained after priming with an rMVA and boosting with RBD protein rather than the

308

homologous rMVA. In part, this may be explained by attenuation of rMVA boosts by immunity

309

to the live virus vector that was generated during the prime. Extending the interval between the

310

first and second rMVA vaccinations to allow the anti-MVA immunity to decline might enhance

311

boosting. Interestingly, the predominance of IgG2a and IgG2c was maintained when RBD was

312

used as the boost for rMVAs, suggesting that the protein stimulated an anamnestic response. The

313

trade-off, however, was a lower CD8+IFNg+ T cell response with the heterologous protocol.

314

The neutralizing antibody titers obtained with the rMVAs (NT50 of ~103 or higher with

315

the RBD protein boost) compared favorably with that achieved by mRNA immunizations. Using

316

the same lentivirus pseudovirus protocol and reagents, the neutralizing titers for immunizations

317

after a prime and boost with mRNA encoding the 2P-modified S reached 819, 89 and 1115

318

reciprocal IC50 geometric mean titer for BALB/c, C57BL/6 and B6C3F1/J mice, respectively

319

(11) and pseudovirus neutralizing titers of ~340 NT50 were obtained with 100 to 250 µg of

320

mRNA in a phase 1 clinical study (48). How well rMVA S constructs will do in other animal

321

models and humans remains to be determined.

322

K18-hACE2 mice were chosen for CoV-2 protection studies because of their

323

susceptibility to severe disease including lung inflammation and death (43, 44). Studies were

324

performed in which the mice were challenged after priming and boosting or after just priming.

325

For the prime-boost study, the mice were first vaccinated with rMVAs 2P or Tri and boosted

326

with the homologous rMVA or with RBD protein in QS21 adjuvant. The control naive mice and

327

mice immunized with the parental MVA lost weight and exhibited signs of morbidity within 5 to

328

6 days after IN inoculation with CoV-2, whereas the challenged mice of all rMVA vaccination

329

groups remained healthy and without weight loss. The rMVA vaccinated mice also resisted a

330

second challenge two weeks later. High virus titers were present in the lungs of the control mice

331

on day 2 and slightly lower on day 5, whereas no virus was detected in the lungs of any of the

332

vaccinated mice. Although CoV-2 was isolated from the nasal turbinates of all control mice on

333

days 2 and 5, only one of eight rMVA vaccinated mice had a low amount of virus on day 2 and

334

none of eight had detectable virus on day 5. High levels of subgenomic N and slightly lower S

335

mRNAs were detected in the lungs of control mice, whereas only traces of N and no S were

336

found in a minority of rMVA vaccinated mice on day 2 only. However, all rMVA vaccinated

337

mice had low levels of subgenomic RNA in the nasal turbinates on day 2 compared to control

338

mice, which was cleared by day 5. Mice challenged after a single rMVA immunization were also

339

protected and had no detectable virus or subgenomic RNAs in the lungs or nasal turbinates on

340

day 5. The detection of low amounts of RNA in the nasal turbinates that was subsequently

341

cleared indicated that sterilizing immunity had not been obtained by systemic rMVA vaccination

342

and would likely require local immunization.

343

Since the MVA vectors stimulated both antibody and T cells, a passive immunization

344

experiment was carried out to evaluate the protective role of antibody alone. Serum from

345

BALB/c mice that had been vaccinated with MVA expressing WT S was injected

346

intraperitoneally into K18-hACE2 mice resulting in NT50s of 160 prior to challenge. Following

347

challenge, the mice remained healthy and lost no weight indicating that antibody is sufficient for

348

protection in this model and that the level of neutralizing antibody elicited by active

349

immunization is considerably higher than necessary.

In the present study, we evaluated rMVA CoV-2 vaccines administered IM with

351

homologous or protein boost protocols. Previous studies have shown enhanced responses when

352

rMVAs were combined with recombinant DNA or other virus vectors (49-51). For example, a

353

filovirus vaccine consisting of an Ad26 vector followed by a rMVA was safe and immunogenic

354

in a phase 2 trial (51). The stability of both Ad26 and rMVA compared to mRNA vaccines,

355

which must be kept frozen except for short periods, is an advantage for global distribution. The

356

rMVA component was shown to remain stable for 24 months frozen, 12 months at 2-8oC and up

357

to 6 h at 40oC in a syringe needle (52). Another point to consider is the route of administration,

358

which can affect the ability of vaccines to prevent spread. In addition to IM and subcutaneous

359

routes, rMVAs can be administered orally, IN and by aerosol (53-60). Although IM

360

administration of the rMVA CoV-2 S vectors greatly reduced and rapidly eliminated virus

361

replication in the nasal turbinates, it will be of interest to determine whether IN administration

362

would prevent replication entirely.

Materials and Methods

365

Cells. Cells were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2 humidified incubators. HeLa cells (ATCC

366

CCL-2) and Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified eagle’s

367

medium (DMEM) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mM L-

368

glutamine, 100 U/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin (Quality Biological). 293T-

369

hACE2.MF cells were propagated in the above medium supplemented with 3 µg/ml of

370

puromycin. Primary CEF prepared from 10-day old fertile eggs (Charles River) were grown in

371

minimum essential medium with Earle’s balanced salts (EMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2

372

mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml of penicillin, and 100 µg/ml of streptomycin.

Mice. Five-to six-week-old female BALB/cAnNTac and C57BL/6ANTac were obtained from

375

Taconic Biosciences and B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J from Jackson Laboratories. Mice were

376

separated into groups of 2-5 animals in small, ventilated microisolator cages in an ABSL-2

377

facility and used after 1-5 additional 5 weeks.

378
379

Construction of Recombinant Viruses. DNA encoding the CoV-2 S protein (QHU36824.1),

380

with a C-terminal 3xFLAG tag and modified by removing four VACV early transcription

381

termination signals (TTTTTNT) and runs of four or more consecutive Gs or Cs, was chemically

382

synthesized (Thermo Fisher). Another construct (Tri) with the proline substitutions

383

(K986P/V987P), furin recognition site substitutions (aa 682–685 RRAR to GSAS), and C-

384

terminal 19 aa deletion of ERRS was also synthesized. Constructs with these individual

385

mutations were generated using Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs). A 2-

386

step PCR protocol using the Q5 mutagenesis kit was used to join nucleotides 1-117, 955-1782

387

and 3586-3819 to form the ORF for RBD. The DNAs were inserted into the pLW44 transfer

388

vector (36) at the XmaI and SalI sites, which placed the ORF under the control of the VACV

389

modified H5 early late promoter and adjacent to the separate gene encoding enhanced GFP

390

regulated by the VACV P11 late promoter.

391

To produce rMVAs, linearized plasmids were transfected into cells infected with MVA

392

allowing recombination into the existing deletion III site in the MVA genome (36). The rMVAs

393

were clonally purified by four successive rounds of fluorescent plaque isolation, propagated in

394

CEF, and purified by sedimentation twice through a 36% sucrose cushion. The genetic purities of

395

the recombinant viruses were confirmed by PCR amplification and sequencing of the modified

397

antibodies (36).

Western Blotting. HeLa cells were infected with 5 PFU per cell of rMVAs for 18 h, washed

400

once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), then lysed in LDS sample buffer with reducing agent

401

(Thermo Fisher). The lysates were dispersed in a sonicator for four 30 s periods; the proteins

402

were resolved on 4 to 12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels (Thermo Fisher) and transferred to a

403

nitrocellulose membrane with an iBlot2 system (Thermo Fisher). The membrane was blocked

404

with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h, washed with TBS with 0.1% Tween

405

20 (TBST), and then incubated at 4°C overnight with rabbit anti-CoV-2 RBD polyclonal

406

antibody (Cat# 40592-T62, Sino Biological) or anti-FLAG M2 peroxidase antibody (Cat#

407

A8592, MilliporeSigma) in 5% nonfat milk in TBST. The membrane that had been incubated

408

with anti-RBD antibody was then incubated for 1 h with secondary antibody conjugated to

409

horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch). After washing, the membrane bound

410

proteins were detected with SuperSignal West Dura substrate (Thermo Fisher).

411
412

Detection of S Protein by Flow Cytometry. HeLa cells were infected with 5 PFU per cell of

413

rMVAs. After 24 h, the infected cells were stained for intracellular and surface S in parallel. For

414

intracellular staining, cells were fixed with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Biosciences), permeabilized

415

with Perm/Wash Buffer (BD Biosciences), and incubated with anti-CoV-2 Spike RBD mAb

416

(SARS2-02) (13) followed by APC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Cat# 405308,

417

BioLegend). For surface detection, the cells were stained directly using the same primary and

418

secondary antibodies. The binding of hACE2 to surface expressed S protein on infected HeLa

(Cat# 10108-H08H-B, Sino Biological) followed by Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-hACE2

421

antibody (Cat# FAB9332R, R&D Systems). The stained cells were acquired on a FACSCalibur

422

cytometer using Cell Quest software and analyzed with FlowJo (BD Biosciences).

423
424

Detection of S-Binding Antibodies by ELISA. CoV-2 S protein produced in HEK293 cells was

425

obtained from the NIAID Vaccine Research Center or Sino Biological and diluted in cold PBS to

426

a concentration of 1 µg/ml. Diluted S protein (100 µl) was added to each well of a MaxiSorp 96-

427

well flat-bottom plate (Thermo Fisher). After incubation for 16-18 h at 4oC, the wells were

428

washed 3 times with 250 µl of PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T, Accurate Chemical) and plates

429

were blocked with 200 µl PBS-T + 5% Nonfat Dry Milk for 2 h at room temperature. During the

430

blocking phase, a series of eight 4-fold dilutions of each mouse serum sample was prepared in

431

blocking buffer. After blocking, plates were washed 3 times with 250 µl of PBS-T and 100 µl of

432

each 4-fold dilution of serum was added to the appropriate well(s) and incubated for 1 h at room

433

temperature. After incubation with serum, plates were washed 3 times with 250 µl of PBS-T.

434

HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Thermo Fisher) was diluted 1:4000 in blocking

435

buffer and 100 µl of the secondary antibody was added to each well for 1 h at room temperature.

436

For detection of antibody isotypes, peroxidase-conjugated isotype-specific antibodies were used

437

(Thermo Fisher). Plates were washed 3 times with 250 µl of PBS-T and then 100 µl of KPL

438

SureBlue TMB 1-component microwell peroxidase substrate (Seracare) was added to each well.

439

The chemiluminescence reaction was stopped after 10 min by addition of 100 µl of 1N sulfuric

440

acid. Spectrophotometric measurements were made at A450 and A650 using a Spectramax Plus

441

384 plate reader with Softmax Pro analysis software (Molecular Devices). Final endpoint titers

Stimulation and Staining of Lymphocytes. Splenocytes from individual mice or pooled from

446

3-5 mice were suspended at 1.5x107 cells/ml in RPMI (Quality Biological) supplemented with

447

10% heat-inactivated FBS, 10 U/ml penicillin, 10 µg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 2

448

mM HEPES as previously described (61). Splenocytes (100 µl) were mixed with 100 µl of

449

individual peptide pools in 96-well plates and incubated at 37oC for 1 h after which brefeldin A

450

(Sigma Aldrich) was added and incubation continued for 4-5 h. Staining of cells was performed

451

at 4oC. Fc receptors were blocked with anti-CD16/32 (Clone 2.4G2, a gift from Jack Bennink,

452

NIAID) for 30 min. Surface staining was performed with anti-mouse CD3-FITC (Clone17A2;

453

BioLegend), anti-mouse CD4-PE (Clone H129.19; BD Biosciences), and anti-CD8-PerCP-Cy5.5

454

(BD Biosciences) for 1 h. Cells were then fixed and permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm

455

solution and stained with IFNg-APC (BD Biosciences) for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS and

456

suspended in PBS containing 2% paraformaldehyde. Approximately 100,000 events were

457

acquired on a FACSCaliber cytometer using Cell Quest software and analyzed with FlowJo (BD

458

Biosciences).

459

A peptide array was obtained from BEI Resources (catalog # NR-52402; SARS-Related

460

Coronavirus 2 Spike (S) Glycoprotein). Each peptide was dissolved in DMSO at 10 µg/ml. A

461

total of 18 peptide pools were prepared, containing 3-11 peptides per pool. For splenocyte

462

stimulation, the final concentration of each peptide was 2 µg/ml. Peptides in the 2 positive pools

463

were: Pool #4 (BEI peptides 32-41); Pool #7 (BEI peptides 61, 64, 77).

Pseudovirus Neutralization Assay. The CoV-2 lentivirus pseudotype assay was carried out as

466

described by Corbett et al. (11) using cells and plasmids obtained from the NIAID Vaccine

467

Research Center. To determine neutralization titers, serum samples were heat inactivated for 30

468

min at 56°C and clarified by high speed microcentrifugation. The day before titration, 5,000

469

293T-hACE2.MF cells were seeded per well in 96-well white walled clear bottom tissue culture

470

plates (Corning) in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine,

471

100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin) with 3 µg/ml of puromycin. For each serum

472

sample, duplicate 4-fold dilution series were prepared in 96-well U-bottom plates (Corning) in

473

DMEM supplemented with 5% heat inactivated FBS with the starting dilution being 1:20 in a

474

final volume of 45 µl per well. The pseudovirus was thawed at 37°C and 45 µl of a dilution

475

previously shown to exhibit a 1000-fold difference in luciferase between uninfected and infected

476

cells was added to all wells except for controls. After 45 min at 37°C, the medium was aspirated

477

and 50 µl sample-virus mixture was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. DMEM

478

(150 µl) supplemented with 5% heat inactivated FBS was added per well and plates were

479

incubated for 72 h at 37°C. Medium was removed from the wells and the cells were lysed with

480

25 µl per well of 1X cell lysis reagent (Promega), shaken at 400 rpm for 15 min at room

481

temperature. Luciferase reagent (50 µl, Promega) was added per well and 90 s later relative

482

luciferase units (RLU) were read on the luminometer (EnSight, Perkin Elmer, 570 nm

483

wavelength, 0.1 mm distance, 0.3 s read). NT50 were calculated using Prism (GraphPad

484

Software) to plot dose-response curves, normalized using the average of the no virus wells as

485

100% neutralization, and the average of the no serum wells as 0%.

MVA Neutralization Assay. A semi-automated flow cytometric assay was carried out as

488

previously described (62) except for substitution of MVA expressing GFP for the WR strain of

489

VACV. Briefly, ten 2-fold serial dilutions of heat-inactivated serum from vaccinated mice were

490

prepared in a 96-well plate and 6.25x103 PFU of MVA-GFP was added to each well and

491

incubated at 37oC for 1 h. Approximately 105 HeLa suspension cells were added to each well in

492

the presence of 44 µg/ml of cytosine arabinoside. After 18 h at 37oC, the cells were fixed in 2%

493

paraformaldehyde and acquired with a FACSCalibur cytometer using Cell Quest software and

494

analyzed with FlowJo. The dilution of mouse serum that reduced the percentage of GFP-

SARS CoV-2 Challenge Virus. SARS CoV-2 USA-WA1/2019 was obtained from BEI

498

resources (Ref# NR-52281) and propagated in a BSL-3 laboratory using Vero E6 cells cultured

499

in DMEM+Glutamax supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated FBS and penicillin, streptomycin,

500

and fungizone by Bernard Lafont of the NIAID SARS Virology Core laboratory. The TCID50 of

501

the clarified culture medium was determined on Vero E6 cells after staining with crystal violet

502

and scored by the Reed-Muench method.

503
504

Vaccination and Challenge Experiments. Prior to vaccination, the virus was thawed, sonicated

505

twice for 30 s on ice and diluted to 2x108 PFU/ml in PBS supplemented with 0.05% bovine

506

serum albumin. In an ABSL-2 laboratory, 50 µl of diluted virus was injected IM into each hind

507

leg of the animal for a total dose of 2x107 PFU. Unless otherwise stated, baculovirus RBD

508

protein provided by Eugene Valkov (NCI) was diluted to 0.2 mg/ml in PBS containing 0.3

509

mg/ml of QS-21 adjuvant (Desert King International, San Diego, CA) and 10 µg of RBD was

injected IM into the left hind leg. All mice scheduled to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 were

511

transferred to an ABSL-3 laboratory a few days prior to virus challenge. The challenge stock of

512

SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2019 was diluted to 2x106 TCID50/ml in PBS. Mice were lightly

513

sedated with isoflourine and inoculated IN with 50 µl of SARS-CoV-2. After infection,

514

morbidity/mortality status and weights were assessed and recorded daily for 14 days by the

515

NIAID Comparative Medical Branch.

516
517

Determination of CoV-2 in Lungs and Nasal Turbinates. At 2- and 5-days post-infection with

518

CoV-2, lung and nasal turbinates were removed and placed in 1.5-2 ml of ice-cold Dulbecco’s

519

PBS and weights of lungs were recorded. Tissues were homogenized for three 25 s intervals in

520

ice water using a GLH-1 grinder equipped with a disposable probe and aerosol proof cap (Omni

521

International). Homogenates were cleared of debris by centrifugation at 4,000 xg for 10 min and

522

the supernatants were transferred to sterile tubes and stored at -80oC. Clarified homogenates

523

were thawed and titrated in quadruplicate on Vero E6 cells using 10-fold serial dilutions in 96-

524

well microtiter plates. After 72-96 h, the plates were stained with crystal violet and scored using

525

the Reed-Muench method to determine TCID50.

526
527

Determination of CoV-2 RNA in Lungs and Nasal Turbinates. Immediately after

528

homogenization of lungs and turbinates, 0.125 ml was transferred to sterile tubes, 0.9 ml Trizol

529

(Thermo Fisher) was added and the mixture frozen. After thawing, RNA was extracted using the

530

Trizol Plus RNA Purification Kit with Phasemaker tubes (Thermo Fisher) following the

531

manufacturer’s instructions. Contaminating DNA was removed from the eluted RNA using the

532

Turbo DNA-free kit (Thermo Fisher) and RNA was reverse-transcribed using the iScript cDNA

538

automated droplet generator and QX200 Droplet Reader (Bio-Rad). The values for CoV-2 S

539

transcripts were normalized using the 18s RNA in the same sample.

540
541

Passive Serum Transfer. Serum for passive transfer was obtained from 20 BALB/c mice that

542

were inoculated IM with rMVA S (WT) and 10 BALB/c mice with parental MVA at 0 and 3

543

weeks. Two weeks after the boosts, the MVA S and control MVA sera were pooled separately.

544

Four naive K18-hACE2 mice each received 0.4 ml of MVA S serum and three received 0.4 ml of

545

the control MVA serum. The following day, mice were bled to determine levels of SARS-CoV-2

546

binding and neutralizing antibody. Approximately 4 h later, the mice were challenged IN with

547

105 TCID50 of CoV-2. Mice were observed and weighed over the next two weeks.

548
549

Safety and Ethics. All experiments and procedures involving mice were approved under

550

protocol LVD29E by the NIAID Animal Care and Use Committee according to standards set

551

forth in the NIH guidelines, Ansaimal Welfare Act, and US Federal Law. Euthanasia was carried

552

out using carbon dioxide inhalation in accordance with the American Veterinary Medical

553

Association Guidelines for Euthanasia of Animals (2013 Report of the AVMA Panel of

554

Euthanasia). Experiments with SARS-CoV-2 were carried out under BSL-3 containment.

Fig. 5. Challenge of transgenic mice following prime and boost vaccinations. (A) Protocol

775

consisted of vaccinating five groups of six K18 hACE2 mice (female, 7 weeks old) IM in each

776

hind leg with 107 PFU of MVA or rMVA on days 0 (prime) and 21 (boost) and challenging

777

unvaccinated (naive) and vaccinated mice with 105 TCID50 of CoV-2 IN on day 35. A second

778

IN challenge of surviving mice and two added naive mice was performed 2 weeks after the first

779

challenge. Mice were weighed daily and observed for signs of morbidity. Mice were bled before

780

vaccination (pre-bleed) and before the boost and 2 weeks after the boost. After challenge, 2 mice

781

from each group were sacrificed on days 2 (*) and 5 (**) to determine the amounts of CoV-2

782

virus and subgenomic RNA. (B) Binding antibody was determined by ELISA on serum from

783

each of the six mice of each vaccinated group and plotted as 1/end-point dilution. Dotted line

784

indicates limit of detection. Abbreviations: X1 refers to sera collected 3 weeks after prime; X2

785

refers to sera collected 2 weeks after homologous boost; /indicates heterologous boost with RBD

protein. (C) Neutralizing antibody was determined by a pseudovirus assay on serum from each

787

of the six mice in each group and plotted as NT50. (D) Weights of surviving mice were

788

determined daily and plotted as per cent of starting weight. Asterisks indicate number of mice

789

that died or euthanized on a specific day. Data for one of the naive mice was obtained in a

790

preliminary experiment. (E) Weights were determined following the second challenge of

791

surviving mice and two naive mice. (F) Virus titers in lung homogenates obtained on days 2 and

792

5 were determined by end point dilution and plotted as TCID50 per gram of tissue. The lower

793

two data points for naive mice on day 2 were determined in a preliminary experiment. (G) Virus

794

titers in nasal turbinate homogenates obtained on days 2 and 5 were determined as in panel F and

795

plotted as TCID50 per sample. (H) RNA was isolated from lung homogenates on days 2 and 5.
