Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the

22

COVID-19 pandemic, causing health and economic problems. Currently, as dangerous

23

mutations emerge there is an increased demand for specific treatments for SARS-CoV-2

24

infected patients. The spike glycoprotein on the virus membrane binds to the angiotensin

25

converting enzyme 2 )ACE2( receptor on host cells through its receptor binding domain

26

(RBD) to mediate virus entry. Thus, blocking this interaction may inhibit viral entry and

27

consequently stop infection. Here, we generated fusion proteins composed of the

28

extracellular portions of ACE2 and RBD fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 (ACE2-

29

Ig and RBD-Ig, respectively). We demonstrate that ACE2-Ig is enzymatically active and

30

that it can be recognized by the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, independently of its enzymatic

31

activity. We further show that RBD-Ig efficiently inhibits in vitro and in vivo SARS-

32

CoV-2 infection, better than ACE2-Ig. Mechanistically we show that anti-spike

33

antibodies generation, ACE2 enzymatic activity and ACE2 surface expression were not

34

affected by RBD-Ig. Finally, we show that RBD-Ig is more efficient than ACE2-Ig at

35

neutralizing high virus concentration infection. We thus propose that RBD-Ig physically

36

blocks virus infection by binding to ACE2 and that RBD-Ig should be used for the

37

treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.

SARS-CoV-2 infection caused serious socio-economic and health problems around the

globe. As dangerous mutations emerge, there is an increased demand for specific

41

treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. SARS-CoV-2 infection starts via binding

42

of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) to its receptor, ACE2, on

43

host cells. To intercept this binding, we generated Ig-fusion proteins. ACE2-Ig was

generated to possibly block RBD by binding to it and RBD-Ig to block ACE2. We indeed

showed that the fusion proteins bind to their respective target. We found that it is more

efficient to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking ACE2 receptor with RBD-Ig. We

also showed that RBD-Ig does not interfere with ACE2 activity or surface expression.

Importantly, as our treatment does not target the virus directly, it may be efficient against

49

any emerging variant. We propose here that RBD-Ig physically blocks virus infection by

50

binding to ACE2 and thus it may be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-infected

51

patients.

Main text

Introduction

55

SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in December 2019 in China. It is a highly contagious

56

virus which had caused worldwide socio-economic, political, and environmental

57

problems [1]. In an attempt to stop the pandemic, the FDA first issued an emergency use

58

authorization for Pfizer [2] and Moderna [3] vaccines, followed by Ad26.COV2.S [4] .

59

Both vaccines, The Pfizer vaccine called BNT162b2 [5], and Moderna vaccine called

60

mRNA-1273 [6], are composed of a lipid-nanoparticle (LNP)–encapsulated mRNA

61

expressing the prefusion-stabilized spike glycoprotein. However, a treatment that will

62

inhibit virus infection is urgently needed because not all individuals will be vaccinated,

63

and even in those that will, the vaccines are not 100% effective. Furthermore, lately

64

dangerous virus mutants appeared which may affect vaccine efficiency [7].

65

To infect cells, the spike glycoprotein, located on SARS-CoV-2 envelope, binds to the

66

ACE2 receptor found on host cells [8]. The spike protein is trimeric, where each

67

monomer contains two subunits: S1 and S2, which mediate attachment and membrane

68

fusion, respectively. S1 itself can be subdivided further into S1a and S1b, where the latter

69

includes the RBD [9]. The virus binds primarily to ACE2 receptors on type 2

70

pneumocytes [10], thus it mainly targets the lungs, but as ACE2 is present on many other

71

cells, it is also capable of causing damage to other organs such as the heart, the liver, the

72

kidneys, blood and immune system [11]. ACE2 is a carboxypeptidase of the renin-

73

angiotensin hormone system that is a critical regulator of blood volume, systemic

74

vascular resistance, and thus cardiovascular homeostasis [12]. ACE2 converts

75

angiotensin I to angiotensin 1-9, a peptide with anti-hypertrophic effects in

4

76

cardiomyocytes [13], and angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, which acts as a vasodilator

77

[14].

78

SARS-CoV-2 life cycle starts with its RBD binding to the ACE2 receptor and ends by

79

release of virions which binds to ACE2 receptors elsewhere [10]. Thus, intercepting the

80

binding of the virions to the ACE2 receptor may help to treat infection. Developing

81

treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection is especially important since the FDA has yet

82

approved any specific treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients [15].

83

To intercept SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2 we have generated fusion proteins

84

containing the extracellular portions of RBD and ACE2 which are fused to the Fc portion

85

of human IgG1. We have chosen this approach since the Fc partner increases the half-life

86

of the protein and enables efficient purification [16]. Indeed, using the IgG Fc as a fusion

87

partner to significantly increase the half-life of a therapeutic peptide or protein was first

88

described in 1989 [17]. Since then, Fc‐ fusion proteins have been investigated for their

89

effectiveness to treat many pathologies. Most Fc‐ fusions target receptor‐ ligand

90

interactions and thus are used as antagonists to block receptor binding (e.g. Etanercept,

91

Aflibercept, Rilonacept, Belatacept, Abatacept) [18]. It has been shown that soluble

92

extracellular domains of ACE2 can act as a decoy, competitive inhibitors for SARS-CoV-

93

2 infection [19,20]. RBD-Ig, on the other hand was tested only as a preventive vaccine

94

against SARS-CoV-2 and not as a possible treatment during active infection [21,22].

95

Taken together, we decided to assess whether fusion proteins consisting of either ACE2

96

or RBD could potentially serve as therapeutics for treating active SARS-CoV-2 infection.

97

Importantly, we demonstrate both in vitro and in vivo that RBD-Ig is more efficient than

98

ACE2-Ig in its ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. We demonstrated that RBD-Ig

99

binding to ACE2 does not interfere with its expression on the cell surface or with its

100

enzymatic activity and suggest that RBD-Ig inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection by physically

101

interacting with ACE2.

102
103

Results

104

Generation of ACE2-Ig and RBD-Ig

105

Since binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to ACE2 on host cells mediates virus infection ([8]

106

and Figure 1A, left), we decided to intercept this binding. For that, we generated fusion

107

proteins composed of the extracellular portions of human ACE2 or the viral RBD fused

108

to the Fc portion of human IgG1. These fusion proteins are expected to inhibit SARS-

109

CoV-2 infection by either blocking SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with ACE2-Ig (Figure

110

1A, middle) or by blocking ACE2 on host cells with RBD-Ig (Figure 1A, left).

111

To investigate whether the RBD-Ig we have generated can indeed bind to ACE2, we

112

expressed ACE2 with an N-terminal flag-tag in 293T cells (293T-ACE2). Expression of

113

ACE2 was verified by flow cytometry using an anti-flag antibody (Figure 1B). We then

114

stained 293T-ACE2 cells with RBD-Ig and demonstrated that RBD-Ig binds to these

115

cells, but not to the parental 293T cells (Figure 1C).

116

Next, to investigate the ability of ACE2-Ig to bind SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we co-

117

transfected 293T cells with SARS-CoV-2 spike envelope plasmid, a packaging plasmid

118

and a GFP plasmid (293T-Spike). As a control we co-transfected 293T cells with a VSV-

119

G envelope plasmid, a packaging plasmid and a GFP plasmid (293T-VSV-G). Staining

120

was performed on GFP-positive gated cells. As can be seen, the 293T-Spike cells express

121

high levels of the spike protein (Figure 1D, left), and were specifically recognized by

122

ACE2-Ig. As expected, ACE2-Ig did not bind to the 293T-VSV-G cells (Figure 1D,

123

right).

124

ACE2 enzymatic activity is not required for its binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike

125

protein

126

After confirming the binding of the fusion proteins to their respective targets, we wanted

127

to check if ACE2-Ig is enzymatically active since enzymatic activity of ACE2 might be

128

important for the course of COVID-19 disease [23,24]. To test the enzymatic activity, we

129

used a commercial kit detailed in the “Methods” section. As can be seen in Figure 2A,

130

ACE2-Ig was as active as human recombinant ACE2. Furthermore, the enzymatic

131

activity of both proteins was completely abolished in presence of an ACE2 inhibitor

132

(Figure 2A). After assessing ACE2-Ig activity, we wanted to test whether the enzymatic

133

activity of ACE2 is required for its recognition by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. For

134

that, we stained 293T-spike cells with ACE2-Ig in the presence or absence of an ACE2

135

inhibitor. We used a concentration of ACE2-Ig at which complete inhibition of enzymatic

136

activity was achieved in the presence of the inhibitor (Figure 2A). As can be seen, no

137

difference in ACE2-Ig binding was observed, regardless of whether the inhibitor was

138

present or not (Figure 2B). Thus, we concluded that ACE2-Ig binding to SARS-CoV-2

139

spike protein is not dependent on its enzymatic activity.

140

RBD-Ig and ACE2-Ig inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro

141

Next, we wanted to test whether in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection can be inhibited by

142

ACE2-Ig or RBD-Ig. To this end, we performed a plaque reduction neutralization test

143

(PRNT), using Vero E6 cells that are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection [25]. Our

144

negative control throughout these assays was a control fusion protein (Control-Ig). To

145

assess inhibition by ACE2-Ig we initially incubated increasing concentration of the

146

fusion protein with 300 PFU/ml of SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour at 37°C, and then infected

147

Vero E6 cells. Conversely, to test for inhibition by RBD-Ig, we had to first incubate the

148

fusion protein with Vero E6 cells for 1 hour at 37°C, and then infect with 300 PFU/ml of

149

SARS-CoV-2. Both strategies required a 48-hour incubation period to allow for plaque

150

formation, followed by counting of said plaques and calculation of neutralization

151

percentage. While the Control-Ig had no neutralizing effect in any of the concentrations

152

tested, a dose-dependent neutralization of virus infection was observed for ACE2-Ig

153

(Figure 2C), as well as for RBD-Ig (Figure 2D). When comparing between RBD-Ig and

154

ACE2-Ig neutralization efficiency, RBD-Ig was significantly more efficient at the highest

155

concentration used. When 50 ug/ml of RBD-Ig was applied, ~75% neutralization was

156

observed (p=0.001) as compared to ~60% neutralization by ACE2-Ig. These results

157

suggest that RBD-Ig inhibits in vitro infection to a greater degree.

158
159

RBD-Ig efficiently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo

160

As RBD-Ig was more efficient than ACE2-Ig in vitro we wanted to further examine the

161

fusion proteins efficiency in vivo. For that purpose, we infected homozygous female

162

K18-hACE2 transgenic mice [26] by inhalation of 200 PFU of SARS-CoV-2. As a

163

control for the infection, we looked at naïve (uninfected and untreated) mice. We also had

164

a control for the treatment which included infected mice treated with an unrelated fusion

165

protein (Control-Ig). The experiments lasted 15 days, during 1-5 days post-infection (dpi)

8

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.18.440302; this version posted April 19, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

166

the mice were injected three times intraperitoneally with 75ug of either RBD-Ig, ACE2-

167

Ig, or Control-Ig. Treatments started 24 hours following infection .

168

Mice from the Control-Ig treated group started dying or losing more than 30% of their

169

initial body weight (which is considered non ethical) at 7 dpi and we therefore could no

170

longer use weight loss to assess the efficacy of our treatment. Thus, percentage of initial

171

body weight was calculated until 7 dpi (Figure 3A). All SARS-CoV-2 infected mice

172

started to lose weight at around 4 dpi. At 6-7 dpi the mice treated with RBD-Ig showed

173

significantly less weight loss, as compared to all other infected groups (Figure 3A). We

174

also monitored mice survival. Importantly, while the infected mice groups treated with

175

Control-Ig or ACE2-Ig showed ~20% survival, the RBD-Ig treated group had

176

significantly higher percentage with 50% survival (Figure 3B).

177

All infected mice generate neutralizing anti-Spike antibodies

178

Finally, we wanted to investigate why the ACE2-Ig fusion protein was less effective than

179

RBD-Ig, both in vitro (Figure 2) and in vivo (Figure 3). We therefore evaluated anti-spike

180

and anti-ACE2 IgG antibody generation in all mice groups. For that, sera were collected

181

at 15 dpi from all mice groups including naïve mice and various sera dilutions were used

182

to stain 293T-Spike cells and 293T-ACE2 cells to assess antibody existence and quantity

183

by flow cytometry (Figure 4A). To our surprise, an equivalent, dose-dependent staining

184

of all 293T-Spike cells was observed with sera obtained from all infected and treated

185

mice (Figure 4A). As expected, no staining was observed when sera of naïve uninfected

186

mice were used (Figure 4A) or when the sera from all mice groups were used to stain the

187

293T-ACE2 cells (Figure 4A). Thus, we concluded that the quantity of antibodies

188

generated is not the reason for why RBD-Ig is more efficient. We then wanted to check

189

the quality of the antibodies, as we suspected that RBD-Ig treated mice will generate

190

more neutralizing antibodies since it was shown that anti-RBD antibodies have

191

neutralization effect [27]. To test this hypothesis, we used the 293T-Spike cells and

192

stained them with ACE2-Ig in the presence or absence of sera obtained from all mice

193

groups. Since naïve mice did not generate anti-spike antibodies (Figure 4A), their sera, as

194

expected, did not contained neutralizing antibodies. Indeed, similar ACE2-Ig binding was

195

observed with and without blocking (Figure 4B). In all the infected mice, a comparable

196

level of blocking was seen with sera regardless of the treatment administered, as assessed

197

by reduced ACE2-Ig staining (Figure 4B). From these results we concluded that all the

198

antibodies that were generated were a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection rather than our

199

treatment.

200

SARS-CoV-2 infection is possibly inhibited via physical blockade of ACE2 by RBD-

201

Ig

202

To further investigate why is RBD-Ig better than ACE2-Ig at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2

203

infection we first generated a specific monoclonal antibody against ACE2 using ACE2-Ig

204

as an antigen. This step was essential since the commercial antibodies (#ABIN1169449

205

and #MA5-32307) we tested did not recognize ACE2 effectively. As can be seen in

206

Figure 5A, our generated antibody (anti-ACE2 01) is specific to ACE2, as it binds only to

207

the 293T-ACE2 cells. To test if the antibody blocks the interaction with SARS-CoV-2

208

RBD, we incubated the antibody with 293T-ACE2 cells for 1 hour and then stained the

10

209

cells with RBD-Ig. The anti-ACE2 01 antibody has no blocking property as its presence

210

did not interfere with the binding of RBD-Ig to the ACE2 (Figure 5B).

211

We then analyzed whether the expression of ACE2 is altered, at various time points,

212

following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We infected 293T-ACE2 cells with a 0.5 MOI and

213

compared between ACE2 surface expression on infected cells to uninfected cells using

214

our anti-ACE2 01 antibody. Cells were harvested at 16-, 24- and 48-hour post-infection

215

and SARS-CoV-2 spike surface expression was assessed by flow cytometry to verify

216

infection. Infected cells indeed expressed SARS-CoV-2 spike protein while uninfected

217

cells did not (Figure 5C, left). Little or no change in ACE2 surface expression was

218

noticed at all the time points (Figure 5C, right), indicating that ACE2 surface levels are

219

not subjected to changes following infection. We then tested if RBD-Ig incubation with

220

293T-ACE2 cells will lead to reduced ACE2 surface expression as we hypothesized that

221

this might be the reason why RBD-Ig is more efficient than ACE2-Ig at neutralizing

222

infection. We incubated RBD-Ig or Control-Ig with 293T-ACE2 cells for 1, 2, 6 and 24

223

hours. Following incubation cells were harvested and ACE2 surface expression was

224

assessed by flow cytometry using our generated antibody, anti-ACE2 01. As can be seen

225

in Figure 5D, ACE2 surface levels were only slightly reduced following RBD-Ig binding,

226

suggesting that this is not the reason why RBD-Ig is superior to ACE2-Ig.

227

Next, we examined whether ACE2 activity will be altered following interaction with

228

RBD-Ig, as we thought that maybe the activity of ACE2 might affect somehow the

229

infection. We incubated 0.1 or 1 ug of RBD-Ig or Control-Ig with recombinant human

230

ACE2 or with 293T-ACE2 cells lysate. ACE2 activity was not affected by RBD-Ig when

231

incubated with human ACE2 or with a lysate containing ACE2 (Figure 5E). These

11

232

combined results suggest that treatment with RBD-Ig inhibits infection without affecting

233

ACE2 activity and surface levels expression.

234

Our last assumption was that RBD-Ig inhibits infection by physically blocking ACE2.

235

We further hypothesized that RBD-Ig is more efficient than ACE2-Ig because RBD-Ig

236

binds to ACE2, for which surface expression does not change following infection (Figure

237

5C, right). In contrast, ACE2-Ig may be less efficient since it targets the spike protein of

238

a constantly replicating virus. To test this hypothesis, we performed a plaque reduction

239

neutralization test (PRNT) as described above (Figure 2C and D). However, instead of

240

increasing the fusion protein concentration, we used one concentration of the fusion

241

proteins (20ug/well) and increased SARS-CoV-2 titers. Neutralization percentages were

242

calculated as compared to respective Control-Ig. RBD-Ig treatment was significantly

243

more efficient at inhibiting in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to ACE2-Ig

244

(Figure 5F).

245

Discussion

246

Saturday 30 January 2021 marked one year since the WHO declared COVID-19 as an

247

international concerning health emergency. At that time, only 9826 SARS-CoV-2 cases

248

were reported in 20 countries. As of February 2, 2021, the total number of cases is ~102

249

million with ~2.2 million deaths reported in 222 countries [28]. As it is now clear that the

250

pandemic will not end soon, a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients is urgently

251

needed. The need arises since vaccination with the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines had just

252

started, and even vaccinated individuals might not be fully protected. First as the vaccines

253

efficiency is ~95% [29] and second because lately alarming SARS-CoV-2 spike

254

mutations were observed in different countries and were transmitted across the world

255

[30][31][32][33]. While the E484K mutations only reduces neutralizing activity of

256

human convalescent and post-vaccination sera [34], the SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 south

257

African variant contains multiple mutations that may enable escape from neutralizing

258

antibodies [35]. These data suggest that reinfection with antigenically distinct variants is

259

possible and may reduce efficacy of current spike-based vaccines.

260

Recently, Bamlanivimab, a recombinant, neutralizing human IgG1 monoclonal antibody

261

against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been authorized by the FDA under an emergency

262

use authorization [36]. But as antibodies are highly specific, there is a risk that the virus

263

will develop escape mutations. This scenario is less likely when using a full protein or

264

one of its domains. For that purpose, we generated the fusion proteins ACE2-Ig and

265

RBD-Ig and tested their functionality. We also tested the ACE2-Ig enzymatic activity

266

since it is known that dysregulation of ACE2 activity can adversely exacerbate lung

267

inflammation and injury [37,38], and induce a general pro-inflammatory response

268

[39,40]. After demonstrating that ACE2-Ig in enzymatically active, we wanted to

269

examine whether ACE2 activity is required for the binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike

270

protein. We demonstrated that the enzymatic activity of ACE2 is not required for its

271

recognition by SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Confirming these results, it was previously reported

272

that binding of SARS-CoV spike protein to ACE2 is also independent of ACE2 catalytic

273

activity [41].

274

We showed that ACE2-Ig inhibits in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection as it has been

275

previously shown [42] and that RBD-Ig inhibits infection significantly more than ACE2-

276

Ig. Furthermore, we show that treatment with RBD-Ig using SARS-CoV-2 K18-hACE2

277

infected mice led to decrease in disease severity as assessed by reduced body weight and

278

increased mice survival. Importantly, 50% of the RBD-Ig treated mice survived although

279

active infection occurred, while ACE2-Ig injection had no effect. We think that the

280

reason behind the low efficiency of ACE2-Ig in vivo is due to the low concentrations of

281

fusion protein we administered which was 75ug/mouse, injected intraperitoneally.

282

Indeed, when Iwanaga et al injected intravenously ACE2-Ig at 15mg/kg per mouse an

283

effect was observed [43].

284

We demonstrated that the superiority of RBD-Ig was not due to quantitative or qualitative

285

changes in the antibody response, we thus hypothesized that it may be due to RBD-Ig

286

effect on its target protein ACE2. To check this, we first wanted to assess whether

287

changes occur in ACE2 surface expression as it is targeted by RBD-Ig. No changes were

288

observed in ACE2 surface expression in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells at different time

289

points. Although many suggest that an ACE2 downregulation might occur during

290

infection [44][45][46], to the best of our knowledge this has not been investigated,

291

perhaps because there was no effective commercial antibody available against ACE2.

292

We also assessed ACE2 surface expression following RBD-Ig incubation and saw that

293

ACE2 expression did not change drastically. Another important check was of ACE2

294

enzymatic activity following binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD as it was reported to enhance

295

ACE2 activity [47]. In contrast, we report here that ACE2 activity was not affected

296

following incubation with RBD-Ig. The reason for this discrepancy is not understood.

297

We next hypothesized that RBD-Ig blocks infection by physically interacting with ACE2.

298

We further thought that RBD-Ig is more efficient than ACE2-Ig since RBD-Ig, binds to

299

the constantly expressed ACE2 on the target cells, while ACE2-Ig interacts with the spike

300

protein found on a replicating virus. Indeed, we showed that RBD-Ig can neutralizes in

301

vitro SARS-CoV-2 even at high virus titers, while ACE2-Ig cannot.

302

To summarize we suggest that RBD-Ig inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection by physically

303

blocking ACE2. Thus, RBD-Ig is particularly advantageous as a treatment for SARS-

304

CoV-2 infection since it targets ACE2 which expression on cell surface remains almost

305

constant, rather than a mutating and replicating virus.

317

SARS-CoV-2 (GISAID accession EPI_ISL_406862) was kindly provided by

318

Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology, Munich, Germany. Virus stocks were propagated

319

(4 passages) and tittered on Vero E6 cells. Handling and experiments with SARS-CoV-2

320

virus were conducted in a BSL3 facility in accordance with the biosafety guidelines of

321

the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR).

322

Mice

323

Homozygous female outbred K18-hACE2 transgenic mice (2B6.Cg-Tg(K18-

324

ACE2)2Prlmn/J, Stock No: 034860, Jackson laboratory) 6-8 weeks old were maintained

325

at 20-22°C with relative humidity of 50 ± 10% on a 12hrs light/dark cycle. Animals were

326

fed with commercial rodent chow (Koffolk Inc.) and provided with tap water ad libitum.

327

Prior infection, mice were kept in groups of 10. Mice were randomly assigned to

328

experimental groups of 7-8 mice per group. 200 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 (10-15 LD50) was

329

331

15 dpi mice were bled through the venous tail and sera were obtained. Residual SARS-

332

CoV-2 virus in the sera was neutralized by heating to 60°C for 30 minutes. Four groups

333

of mice were used: 1. Naïve (uninfected & untreated mice). 2. Infected and treated with

334

Control-Ig. 3. Infected and treated with ACE2-Ig. 4. Infected and treated with RBD-Ig.

335

Flow cytometry

336

Primary antibody staining was performed at 4°C for 1 hour, cells were then washed in

337

FACS buffer (1% BSA and 0.05% Sodium Azide in phosphate-buffered saline) and

338

secondary antibody was added for 30 minutes at 4°C. Then, cells were washed in FACS

339

buffer and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes followed by CytoFlex

340

analysis. We used the following primary antibodies: Rabbit MAb SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1

341

Antibody (Cat#40150-R007-100, Sino Biological), Purified anti-DYKDDDDK Tag

342

Antibody (Cat#637302, BioLegend), anti-ACE2 01 (generated by us). The following

343

secondary antibodies were used: Alexa Fluor 647- conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG

344

(Cat#111-606-144, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated

345

Fusion proteins

349

PCR-generated fragments encoding the extracellular part of human ACE2 or SARS-CoV-

350

2 RBD were each cloned into vectors containing the Fc portion of human IgG1, and a

351

Puromycin resistance gene. Sequencing of the constructs revealed that cDNA of all Ig-

352

fusion proteins was in frame with the human Fc genomic DNA and were identical to the

353

reported sequences. The Ig-vectors were then introduced to 293T cells (CRL-3216,

377

collected and filtered.

378

Generation of 293T-ACE2 cells

379

ACE2 was amplified from cDNA and an N-terminal Flag-Tag was introduced

380

immediately after the signal peptide. The flag-tagged ACE2 was cloned into the plasmid

381

pHAGE- DsRED(-) GFP(+). This plasmid carrying the Flag-tagged ACE2 was used as a

382

vector construct to produce lentiviruses as described above. The resulting lentiviruses

383

were used to infect 293T cells. The transduced cells were stained with anti-human ACE-

384

2, RBD-Ig and checked for GFP percentage by Flow Cytometry. PCR-generated

385

fragments were made from 2 separated PCR reactions followed by a third reaction in

386

which we used the forward primer of reaction 1, the reverse primer of reaction 2 and the

387

products from reaction 1 and 2 as a template. Primer FW reaction 1:

Generation of 293T-Spike cells

393

First, 293T cells were grown overnight in 6-well plates (2.2X105 cells/well). Then SARS-

394

CoV-2 spike envelope expression plasmid was co-transfected as described above with the

395

plasmid pHAGE- DsRED(-) GFP(+) as a vector construct. As a control we performed the

396

same co-transfection but with the VSV-G envelope plasmid. 48 hours following

397

transfection, media (containing lentiviruses) was removed, and cells were used for flow

399

each flow cytometry experiment we generated new 293T-Spike cells as described here.

400

Enzymatic activity

401

The enzymatic activity of the ACE2-Ig fusion protein was evaluated using the ACE2

402

Activity Assay Kit (Fluorometric) (Cat#BN01071, Assay Genie) according to the

403

manufacturer instructions. 0.8 ug/well of ACE2-Ig was used with or without the inhibitor

404

supplied with the kit. The 293T-ACE2 cells lysate was prepared and 10 ug of it was

405

incubated with RBD-Ig according to the manufacturer instructions. Plates were read by

406

Tecan Spark 10M and data were analyzed using Magellan 1.1.

407

Fusion protein staining with inhibitor

408

0.8 ug/well of ACE2-Ig was incubated with or without the ACE2 inhibitor (supplied with

409

the kit described above) for 15 minutes at room temperature. Then, ACE2-Ig (with or

410

without the inhibitor) was added to either the 293T parental cells or to the 293T-Spike

411

cells for 1 hour at 4°C. Afterwards, cells were washed in FACS buffer and stained with

412

Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-human IgG secondary antibody. Then, cells were

413

washed in FACS buffer and analyzed by CytoFlex.

414

SARS-CoV-2 Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) with ACE2-Ig

415

Vero E6 cells (CRL-1586, ATCC) were seeded in 12-well plates (5x105 cells/well) and

416

grown overnight in Penicillin-Streptomycin-Neomycin (P/S/N, BI) containing medium.

417

The following day, ACE2-Ig and Control-Ig were either diluted to 50µg/ml-0.048µg/ml

418

or 200ug/ml in 400µl of MEM containing 2% FBS, NEAA, 2mM L-Glutamine, and

419

P/S/N. The diluted fusion proteins ACE2-Ig and Control-Ig were then mixed with 400µl

420

of 300 PFU (Plaque Forming Units)/ml or 100- 218,700 PFU/ml of SARS-CoV-2.

421

The virus-protein mixtures were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 1 hour. Vero E6 cell

422

monolayers were washed once with DMEM and 200µl of each dilution of protein-virus

423

mixture was added in triplicates for 1 hour at 37°C. Virus without fusion protein served

424

as control. 2ml/well overlay {MEM containing 2% FBS and 0.4% Tragacanth (Sigma-

425

Aldrich)} were added to each well and plates were incubated at 37°C 5% CO2 for 48

426

hours. The overlay was then aspirated, the cells were fixed and stained with 1ml of

427

crystal violet solution (BI). The number of plaques in each well were determined and

428

neutralization percentages were calculated as follows: 100 × [1 – (average number of

429

plaques for each dilution/average number of the virus dose control plaques)]. SARS-

430

CoV-2 strain used was kindly provided by Bundeswehr Institute of Microbiology,

SARS-CoV-2 PRNT with RBD-Ig

433

Vero E6 cells were seeded in 12-well plates as described above. The next day, RBD-Ig

434

and Control-Ig were either diluted to 25µg/ml-0.024µg/ml or 100ug/ml in 400µl of MEM

435

containing 2% FBS, NEAA, 2mM L-Glutamine, and P/S/N. Cell monolayers were

436

washed once with DMEM and the diluted fusion protein RBD-Ig or Control-Ig was then

437

added in triplicates (200µl/well). Cell monolayers were then incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2

438

for 1 hour. Afterwards 100µl of 300 PFU (Plaque Forming Units)/ml or 100- 218,700

439

PFU/ml of SARS-CoV-2 was added for 1 hour at 37°C. Then 2ml/well overlay were

440

added, and plates were incubated at 37°C 5% CO2 for 48 hours, as described above. The

441

cells were then fixed and stained, and neutralization percentages were determined as

442

described above.
