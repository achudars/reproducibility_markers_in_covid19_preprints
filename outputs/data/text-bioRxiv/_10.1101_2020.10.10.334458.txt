Abstract:
Stroke and central nervous system dysfunction are cardinal symptoms in critically ill corona
virus disease 19 (COVID-19) patients. In an autopsy series of 32 COVID-19 patients, we
investigated whether carotid arteries were infected with SARS-CoV-2 by employing genomic,
virologic, histochemical and transcriptomic analyses. We show that SARS-CoV-2
productively infects and modulates vascular responses in carotid arteries. This finding has far
reaching implications for the understanding and clinical treatment of COVID-19.

Main:
In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was
reported in Wuhan, China. Corona virus disease 19 (COVID-19) has since spread worldwide
affecting more than 7,750,000 people and causing more than 430,000 deaths by June 14,
2020. COVID-19 is characterized by respiratory symptoms with a significant number of
patients developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ failure,
eventually leading to death, especially in older patients with multiple co-morbidities

1-4

. In

critically ill patients, who often present with viremia, the virus has been detected in multiple
organs 2. A large autopsy series revealed that pulmonary artery embolism and/or deep vein
thrombosis were present in about 40% of cases, indicating that COVID-19 is strongly
associated with coagulopathy 3. Notably, large vessel stroke including one proven case of
carotid artery thrombosis was reported in 5 younger COVID-19 patients 5. In 58 COVID-19
patients with ARDS, neurologic symptoms associated with brain perfusion abnormalities
and/or stroke were highly prevalent 6,7. Endotheliitis as the potential cause for the COVID-19
induced vascular dysfunction and coagulopathy was inferred by histopathology analysis of
various postmortem tissues from a limited number of patients 8,9.

Using real time PCR, we quantified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Arteria carotis communis (A.
carotis, carotid artery) samples and matching lung- and throat samples from 32 COVID-19
patients (basic clinical data see online methods). All patients showed high viral loads in the
lung, consistent with viral pneumonia 3. In 26 (81.25%) of the A. carotis samples viral RNA
was detected, with mean viral loads that were comparable to those observed in throat samples
(Fig. 1a). Histopathologic findings in the carotid arteries were age-appropriate with a
moderate degree of inflammation and no obvious signs of vasculitis (supplemental Table S1).
On the basis of virus positivity in A. carotis and the availability of additional tissues and
organs, we attempted live/infectious virus isolation from A. carotis and 10 matching organ
samples (Fig, 1b). We included 7 patients in this analysis (Fig. 1a, red circles), out of whom 5
had ante-mortem viremia, one had no viremia and one had an unknown viremia status. The
clinical histories of the patients are summarized in supplementary Table S2. Virus isolation
most frequently (up to 75%) succeeded in A. carotis and Vena saphena as well as in lung,
throat and jejunum, with the latter three tissues being known sites of virus replication

10,11

.

Viral genome analysis revealed identical viral sequences in A. carotis and lung samples from
the same patients, whereas a number of single nucleotide variations differentiated sequences
from different patients. All SARS-CoV-2 sequences belong to the most prevalent genotype in
Europe (supplemental Fig S1). Isolation of infectious virus from organs required ante-mortem
viremia and isolation rates correlated well with viral loads in the respective organs (Fig. 1b).
Virus isolation from liver, myocardium, spleen and frontal cortex of the brain was
unsuccessful. Relative abundance of subgenomic (sg) SARS-CoV-2 RNAs (which are
generated during virus replication) were determined for 5 of the 7 carotid arteries (arteries #6
and #7 could not be sequenced due to low RNA quality) and were found to be, on average,
comparable or even higher than those observed in lung samples (Fig. 1c, supplementary Table
S3). Together these data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in carotid arteries.

To investigate which cells in the carotid artery wall were infected with the virus, we
performed SARS-CoV-2 plus-strand RNA in situ hybridization as well as anti-spike
immunofluorescence and -immunohistochemistry in tissue sections. These staining techniques
conclusively detected viral RNA and protein in the endothelial layer of the artery wall (Fig.
2a-d, supplemental Fig. S2).
We performed transcriptome analysis in A. carotis tissues from patients 4 and 5 (selected on
basis of RNA quality) and two non-COVID-19 control patients in order to characterize the
transcriptional response of SARS-CoV-2 infected arteries. Interestingly, type I and type II
interferon pathways were down regulated in the SARS-CoV-2 infected arteries, which is in
line with recent work demonstrating lowered interferon-related pathways and innate antiviral
responses in SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines and animal models

12

. Of note, pathways and

genes indicative of an inflamed endothelium (e.g. VCAM and NFκB) and an angiogenic
vessel response (e.g. TIE1 and EGR1) were also strongly down regulated in the arteries of the
deceased COVID-19 patients, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a strong antiinflammatory and anti-proliferative state in blood vessels. Although these results comply with
recent reports of a strong immunosuppressive effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection 12, they need to
be interpreted with caution because patients 4 and 5 suffered from acute myeloid leukemia
and myelofibrosis, respectively. These conditions are not generally associated with decreased
inflammatory

responses,

but

it

is

nevertheless

possible

that

disease-specific

immunodeficiency may have contributed to the observed phenotypes.
We propose that after entering the bloodstream, SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in
vascular endothelial cells, where it modulates vascular responses and further migrates into
organs. Notably, an increase in Kawasaki disease, a medium vessel vasculitis in children, has
been recently linked to COVID-19

13,14

. How exactly infection of carotid arteries or other

blood vessels contribute to the clinical symptoms, organ infection and final outcome of
COVID-19 needs to be investigated in future studies.
