Abstract

Accommodating large increases in sample workloads has presented one of the biggest challenges
to clinical laboratories during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the implementation of new
automated detection systems, and previous efficiencies such as barcoding, electronic data
transfer and extensive robotics, throughput capacities have struggled to meet the demand.
Sample pooling has been suggested as an additional strategy to further address this need. The
greatest concern with this approach in a clinical setting is the potential for reduced sensitivity,
particularly the risk of false negative results when weak positive samples are pooled. To
investigate this possibility, detection rates in pooled samples were evaluated, with extensive
assessment of pools containing weak positive specimens. Additionally, the frequency of
occurrence of weak positive samples across ten weeks of the pandemic were reviewed. Weak
positive specimens were detected in all five-sample pools but failed to be detected in four of the
24 nine-sample pools tested. Weak positive samples comprised an average 16.5% of the positive
specimens tested during the pandemic thus far, slightly increasing in frequency during later
weeks. Other aspects of the testing process should be considered, however, such as accessioning
and reporting, which are not streamlined and may be complicated by pooling procedures.
Therefore, the impact on the entire laboratory process needs to be carefully assessed prior to
implementing such a strategy.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented numerous challenges to the health care industry in
general and laboratory testing specifically. Not least among the latter has been a dramatic
increase in sample testing load (1). Efforts to meet the demand have included increased use of
automated instrumentation, multiplexing of molecular detection assays, streamlined testing
protocols, as well as increasingly varied acceptable sample types, collection devices and
transport media (2-4). Accommodating the testing workload and reagent shortage during the
symptomatic pandemic wave was a significant undertaking (1). However, the more recent task,
to test returning healthcare workers as well as patients returning for services such as nonessential surgery and other clinical procedures, has generated an even greater challenge. One
proposed solution has been sample pooling (5-8), a method previously used for numerous other
situations where large scale testing was needed (9-12).
When used as an epidemiological surveillance tool, acceptable parameters and limits may be
quite different to those when the same system is applied in a clinical testing setting (6, 13-16). In
the latter, the issue of detection sensitivity for every individual specimen becomes critical.
Methods for pooling vary widely and testing large numbers of pooled samples is not possible
without an inherent loss of sensitivity. However, there is the potential for more limited pooling,
without loss of sensitivity. We sought to investigate to what extent this was possible, while
maintaining the detection of weak positive samples.
Methods:
The CDC 2019 nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (17-19) was used throughout, with
extraction on the bioMerieux EMAG® (bioMerieux Inc, Durham, NC). For individual
specimens, 110µL of Viral Transport Media (VTM, Regeneron, Rensselaer) or Molecular
Transport Media (MTM, PrimeStore, LongHorn, San Antonio, TX) from upper respiratory swab,
was added to 2mL NucliSens Lysis Buffer (bioMerieux) and extracted into 110µL of eluate.
The bioMerieux EMAG extraction system will accommodate a maximum volume of 3ml.
Therefore, a maximum of nine samples (110 µL per sample) could be added to a 2ml lysis buffer
tube without exceeding the maximum volume, while maintaining the same input volume per
specimen. If the same extraction efficiency is maintained when nine samples are loaded in the
tube as when one is loaded, and the eluate is still 110µL, theoretically the same total nucleic acid
from each sample should be extracted. Provided there is no increase in the PCR inhibition of the
pooled eluate, the detection sensitivity should therefore also still be the same.
Pool sizes of five and nine samples were tested, with each pool containing a single positive
specimen. For specimen pooling, 110µL each of one positive, and either four (five-sample pool)
or eight (nine-sample pool) negative specimens were added, at random, to 2mL of lysis buffer, in
triplicate, extracted and eluted into 110µL of elution buffer.
In an initial experiment, strong and moderate positive samples in VTM were tested in each size
pool. In a second experiment, four weak positive specimens in VTM and four weak positive
specimens in MTM, were tested in both five and nine sample pools, in triplicate.

Additionally, the percentage of positive samples at different viral loads, as assessed by Ct value,
was reviewed across nine weeks of the pandemic, to determine if these weak positive specimens
comprise a significant component of total tested specimens and whether the proportion has
changed over the course of the pandemic.
Results:
Pooling of samples with lower Ct values did not cause a loss of detection of any of the individual
positive samples in either the five- or nine-sample pools (Table 1), although in one of the ninesample pools, the detection became inconclusive rather than positive (specimen D). The Ct
values of positive samples were increased by 0.4 to 1.51 when pooled with four negative
samples. In contrast, pooling with 8 negative samples caused Ct increases ranging from 0.94 to
8.49.
When weak positive samples were pooled with four or eight negative samples (Table 2), the
positive samples were still all detected in five-sample pools, whether they were in VTM or MTM
transport media. When combined in nine-sample pools, detection was more adversely affected
for samples in VTM than those in MTM. For samples in MTM, one of three replicates for one
sample, failed to be detected in a pool of nine samples. In contrast, for weak positive specimens
in VTM transport media, nine-sample pools caused multiple replicates to return negative results.
We then sought to assess what component of the total specimens tested are comprised of these
weak positive specimens, to evaluate how much of an impact pooling might have overall on
testing sensitivity across positive patient detection in the pandemic. Further, to assess the
positivity rate during the months since the onset of the pandemic in New York, since pooling
strategies are not efficient unless sample positivity is low. Despite the large range in number of
specimens tested per day from late February through mid-May (Figure 1), the percentages of
specimens with viral loads ranging from very strong (Ct < 20), strong (Ct 21-25), moderate (Ct
26-30), weak (Ct 31-35) and very weak (Ct 36-40) remained remarkably constant, with the
exception of those in the very weak range which increased slightly during the last five weeks.
Overall, this weak positive sample type constituted an average 16.5% of positive specimens, a
substantial proportion of the positive specimens received for testing.
Positivity rates among samples received at this facility rose to almost 30% during March and has
continually dropped since early April, remaining below 5% since 10th May and below 1.5% since
May 16.
Discussion
As the pandemic evolves, despite case counts, hospitalization rates and fatalities decreasing in
some areas, laboratories continue to face new challenges. Workloads have increased with, for
example, requirements to perform repeated surveillance screening of asymptomatic health care
workers and testing of patients undergoing elective procedures where there is a risk of aerosol
production. These policies have pushed test numbers beyond those encountered even at the
height of the pandemic wave. Suggestions to help manage the load have included pooling of
samples to enhance throughput capacity. When being considered for application in a clinical
testing environment, of greatest concerns is the potential for this strategy to increase the false

negative rate. With that, the greatest risk of false negative results is with weak positive samples.
To investigate the potential limits of pooling in this situation, this study focused on pooling weak
positive samples in relatively small size sample pools. Had these been successful, larger pools
would have been attempted.
There are multiple methods for pooling samples, some of which carry an inherent risk of
reducing test sensitivity and some of which do not. The method described in this paper, where
the same volume of each sample is added to lysis buffer as would normally be added if the
sample were being tested individually, does not theoretically adversely affect sensitivity, as long
as extraction efficiency is maintained and the level of PCR inhibition is not increased by the
additional load through the extraction device. When the data was analyzed, despite some minor
shifts in Ct values, no loss of detection was observed in any of the five-pool experiments, for
samples that had been collected in either VTM or MTM. However, when the same weak
positive samples were pooled with 8 negative samples rather than 4, to create pools of 9,
detection failures were observed. In three of the 9-sample VTM pools and one of the 9-sample
MTM pools, this larger pool size resulted in a complete loss of detection. Whether the less
frequent occurrence in MTM samples compared to VTM samples is significant is difficult to say
based on this limited data.
The use of pooling as a throughput enhancement strategy is only efficient if the positivity rate in
the samples being tested is low enough that a minimal number of pools will test positive,
otherwise, multiple pools will have to be deconvoluted for retesting of individual samples. The
optimal or maximum positivity level at which pooling starts to become efficient, depends on the
pool size being used. For pool sizes as small as 5 samples, this maximum positivity level is
considerably higher than that for very large pool sizes that are sometimes suggested for large
scale epidemiological screening studies. For example, at a positivity rate of 1% and a pool size
of 5, on average, only 1 in every 20 pools will be positive and need to be deconvoluted for
retesting. Therefore, for every 100 samples, testing could be achieved with a total of 25 tests (20
pools and one deconvoluted pool). We noted that the positivity rate in our own lab is now
approaching 1% and therefore such a strategy may be efficient for extraction and detection.
Moreover, as the pandemic has progressed, there has been an increasing proportion of samples in
the weak positive range, and therefore major consideration must be given to the issue of
detection sensitivity for these weak samples. It must be noted however, that extraction and
detection are not the only components of the laboratory operation and a pooling strategy does not
enhance other aspects and may in fact create complications.
Processes for specimen receiving and accessioning, as well as those for result data management
and reporting, are not reduced by pooling strategies. These procedures may be complicated by
sample pooling, especially for electronic data transfer programs and laboratory information
systems. A large increase in test load facilitated by a pooling strategy, may create serious
workload bottlenecks for these and other areas of the operation. Therefore, the global
implications of a pooling strategy need to be carefully assessed, especially in the clinical testing
environment, before implementation.
