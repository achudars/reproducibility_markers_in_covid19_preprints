Abstract
Since the discovery of SARS-CoV-2, several antigens have been proposed to be part of
COVID-19 vaccines. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike protein is one of the promising
candidates to develop effective vaccines since it can induce potent neutralizing antibodies. We
previously reported the production of RBD in Pichia pastoris and showed it is structurally
identical to the protein produced in mammalian HEK-293T cells. In this work we designed an
RBD multimer construct with the purpose of increasing RBD immunogenicity. We produced
multimeric particles by a transpeptidation reaction between the RBD expressed in P. pastoris and
Lumazine Synthase from Brucella abortus (BLS), which is a highly immunogenic and very
stable decameric protein of 170 kDa. We vaccinated mice with two doses 30 days apart, and then
we measured humoral immune response. When the number of RBD copies coupled to BLS was
high (6-7 RBD molecules per BLS decamer, in average), the immune response was significantly
better than that elicited by RBD alone or even by RBD-BLS comprising low number of RBD
copies (1-2 RBD molecules per BLS decamer). Remarkably, the construct with high number of
RBD copies induced high IgG titers with high neutralizing capacity. Furthermore, a superior
immune response was observed when Al(OH)3 adjuvant was added to this formulation,
exhibiting a higher titer of neutralizing antibodies. Altogether our results suggest that RBD
covalent coupled to BLS forming a multimer-particle shows an advantageous architecture to the
antigen-presentation to the immune system which enhances immune responses. This new antigen
should be considered a potent candidate for a protein-based vaccine.

Introduction
The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which was detected about one year ago in Wuhan, Republic
of China in December 2019, has produced over 3.0 million deaths by April, 2021
(https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). Since the discovery of the new strain, several vaccines
have been developed (https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/vaccines/), based on inactivated viruses,
DNA, RNA and/or proteins1–3. Furthermore, multivalent antigens that mimic antigen
presentation by viral particles have been shown to induce a stronger immune response than
monomeric antigens4, thus allowing immunization with lower doses of antigen, as well as the
combination of different antigen variants. This approach would be critical in the specific case of
new circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages that have unfortunately emerged around the world5.
The receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is responsible for the
interaction of the virus with the receptor Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2)6, which
allows the penetration of the virus into the cells. Therefore, RBD constitutes a suitable target to
develop diagnostic and therapeutic tools, as well as vaccines. It has been found that several
neutralizing antibodies produced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection are directed towards RBD7,8. The
structure of the complex formed by SARS-CoV-2 RBD and human ACE2 was recently
determined9. Unlike SARS-CoV-1, several residue changes in SARS-CoV-2 RBD stabilize two
virus-binding hotspots at the RBD/ACE2 interface increasing the affinity for ACE2 9.
SARS-CoV-2 Spike’s RBD is a challenging protein to produce in heterologous systems
because it has nine cysteine residues (eight of which form disulfide bonds), a complex topology
and two N-glycosylation sites10,11. For these reasons, RBD is often expressed in mammalian
cells9,12. Nevertheless, our AntiCovid consortium was able to produce RBD at high yields in
Pichia pastoris. Its immunogenicity, stability and biophysical properties were similar to those of
RBD produced in mammalian HEK-2913T cells; notably, combined with adjuvants it elicited
humoral immune response in mice12. Remarkably, the production of RBD in yeast cells is more
cost effective compared to other systems, and the fermentation bioprocess can be scaled up
under Good Manufacturing Practice conditions. We were capable of optimizing RBD expression
in P. pastoris to reach yields of 180 mg/L of ～90% pure protein, and thus were able to supply it
to the Argentinian scientific community and health system at a low cost. It is currently used as

an antigen for serological test kits, and as an immunogen. RBD could be used to produce
neutralizing antibodies at large scale in animal systems such as egg yolk (IgY)13,14 or in horses15.
While RBD is immunogenic per se, the development of a highly immunogenic antigen is
essential for the development of new generation subunit vaccines, which ideally should be
capable of simultaneously providing immunity against the different emerging RBD variants. A
possible strategy to achieve this goal is to couple the protein of interest to an immunogenic
carrier protein. Lumazine synthase (LS, EC 2.5.1.78) from Brucella abortus (BLS) is a highly
immunogenic and very stable decameric protein ideally suited to function as an immunogenic
carrier protein. Five BLS subunits (17 kDa each) form a pentamer, and two pentamers form a
very stable decamer. Such decamers may be decorated with any protein whose antigenicity needs
to be increased. The BLS decamer has been used to significantly increase the immunogenicity of
other proteins by means of the fusion between the C-terminus of the foreign protein and the
N-terminus of BLS, showing that BLS is a convenient platform for antigen display16–18.
Moreover, BLS activates dendritic cells in vitro, increasing the levels of co-stimulatory
molecules and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, and also recruits dendritic cells in
vivo, in both cases in a TLR4-dependent manner19. In addition, BLS chimeras are extremely
effective to rapidly activate specific CD8+ lymphocytes, and to induce significant cytotoxic
activity20. While other carrier proteins have been non-covalently attached to target proteins
through a pair of interacting proteins (e.g. X-dockerin-cohesin-Y21 where X and Y are proteins
expressed as a fusion protein with the dockerin and cohesin domains, respectively), such
non-covalent interactions might be relatively weak particularly for immunization purposes,
which normally require the use of strong adjuvants. The translational fusion of target proteins
and peptides with BLS has allowed researchers to overcome this problem22. However, given that
BLS fusions are usually expressed at high yields in Escherichia coli, this strategy may be not
adequate for proteins with a complex structure and high disulfide bonds content, and/or that
require post translational modifications, as it is the case of RBD, which cannot be properly
expressed in E. coli12. This problem could be circumvented through the covalent coupling of
RBD and BLS, in vitro, in their native state, which can be achieved with the Sortase A enzyme.
Sortase A and its variants can efficiently catalyze a transpeptidation reaction that creates a
covalent link between two native proteins or peptides23. This reaction requires that the

N-terminal protein to be covalently linked contains a specific signal located in its C-terminal
stretch: ProteinN-Leu-Pro-X-Thr-Gly (Figure 1). This site should preferably be in an
unstructured context, and the Gly residue is usually followed by a histidine tag to facilitate its
purification process. The C-terminal protein to be covalently linked should contain three Gly
amino acid residues in its N-terminal region (Gly-Gly-Gly-ProteinC). After the Sortase A
transpeptidation reaction, both subunits are joined to produce the covalently-linked product
ProteinN-Leu-Pro-X-Thr-Gly-Gly-Gly-ProteinC (Figure 1). Therefore, the Sortase A-mediated
transpeptidation reaction can couple preassembled oligomeric carriers such as BLS, or virus-like
particles (VLPs), to an immunogen expressed in a different system24. An additional advantage of
Sortase A-mediated coupling is that the scar of the transpeptidation reaction in the protein
product is of only seven residues, of which three are glycines.

with the purpose of increasing RBD immunogenicity. RBD-BLS induced a strong humoral
response against SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Remarkably, the RBD antigen produced a significantly
higher humoral response when presented to the immune system in the context of an RBD-BLS
multimer with a high number of RBD molecules per particle (high multiplicity) than as a
monomer, or within low multiplicity particles. The RBD-BLS multimer is a potential vaccine
candidate, and can also be useful to produce neutralizing antibodies in animal systems. This
platform could be also used to simultaneously present several proteins to the immune system,
such as different RBD variants and other domains of the spike protein.
Results
Production of Sortase A- Substrates: BLS in E. coli and RBD in Pichia pastoris.
In order to obtain a multimeric carrier for RBD, we first produced an oligomeric form of BLS
in E. coli. For this purpose we synthesized and sequenced a gene encoding a BLS carrier protein
variant which included in its N-terminal region a TEV protease cleavage site (in italics) followed
by a Gly-tag (Met-Glu-Asn-Leu-Tyr-Phe-Gln-Gly-Gly-Gly-BLS) (Figure 1). This strategy
allows the removal of the N-terminal Met after a quantitative digestion with the TEV protease,
thus producing a polypeptide carrying an N-terminal Gly-Gly-Gly required for the Sortase
A-mediated transpeptidation reaction. Following BLS expression in E. coli, the protein was
purified in two steps, by anion exchange chromatography (Q-Sepharose) followed by size
exclusion chromatography (SEC-HPLC, Superdex S200). The protein was obtained with a high
yield (100 mg L-1, >98% purity), and its identity was verified after purification by mass
spectrometry. BLS was then digested with TEV protease to generate the N-terminal Gly-Gly-Gly
motif so that it can function as a Sortase A substrate. The digestion was confirmed by
SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry (Figures S1 and S2), which showed the expected
“activated” multimeric carrier Gly-Gly-Gly-BLS. It is worth mentioning a complete TEV
digestion of BLS was observed.
To generate the second substrate of the coupling reaction, an RBD variant including a Sortase
A recognition signal (Leu-Pro-Glu-Thr-Gly-) followed by a (His)6-tag at its C-terminus was
produced in P. pastoris (RBD-Leu-Pro-Glu-Thr-Gly-(His)6) and obtained from culture
supernatants with a high yield (180 mg L-1, >90% purity). We have previously shown that this

protein is conformationally stable and drives a significant immune response in mice when
administered in a formulation with adjuvants25. We assessed the tertiary structure of the purified
RBD through near-UV-CD spectroscopy. The results are compatible with an asymmetric and
rigid environment of the aromatic side chains, indicating a native packing (Figures 2A and B).
Moreover, the protein does not exhibit significant aggregation, as inferred from the SEC-HPLC
profiles and the absence of species with low elution volumes (Figure 2C). In addition, as
previously observed25, SEC-HPLC analysis revealed the existence of two different species
(differing in their glycosylation patterns) with elution times compatible with molecular masses
between 45 kDa and 20 kDa.

Native Sortase A Mediated Coupling of RBD to a Fluorescent Peptide
To evaluate the ability of recombinant RBD-Leu-Pro-Glu-Thr-Gly-(His)6 to act as a Sortase A
substrate, we first carried out a preliminary reaction using the fluorescent peptide probe
Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-{Lys-(TMR)} as a substrate instead of BLS. This peptide contains a covalently
bound tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) label. The product of this reaction was the covalently
coupled RBD-Leu-Pro-Glu-Thr-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-(Lys-TMR) (RBD-TMR).
After the coupling reaction and SEC (G25) separation, nearly 17% of input RBD was labeled
with the fluorescent probe as inferred from UV and visible spectra analysis (Figures 3A and B).
The unreacted RBD retained the (His)6 tag, and could therefore be separated and recovered by
addition of NTA resin to the reaction mix followed by centrifugation. This procedure produced a
final yield of ~50% labelled RBD. Moreover, SEC-HPLC analysis, monitored at 554 nm, which
allows detection of the TMR label, revealed the presence of the reaction product. However, no
free fluorescent peptide was observed in the elution profile (Figure 3C), indicating that the G25
matrix was capable of separating the residual free peptide. SEC-HPLC (using the Superose 6
column) of the reaction product showed an absence of peaks at short elution times, suggesting
that RBD-TMR was not prone to aggregation after the covalent coupling of the probe. These
results showed that Sortase A was functional, and it was possible to carry out the covalent
coupling between recombinant RBD and a Gly-Gly-Gly-tagged substrate.

Functionality of Recombinant RBD
In addition to the conformational analysis, we also assessed the functionality of purified
RBD-TMR. Therefore, we tested its ability to bind RBD natural receptor during viral infection,
the human ACE2. For this purpose, we incubated (a) the labeled protein (RBD-TMR), (b) a
soluble version of ACE2 with a C-terminal (His)6 tag, and (c) agarose-NTA-Ni2+resin (Figure
4A)

during

min.

Next,

we

separated

the

ternary

complex

ACE2/RBD-TMR/agarose-NTA-Ni2+ by centrifugation. The matrix agarose-NTA-Ni2+ interacts
with the (His)6 tag that it is present only in the C-terminal of ACE2 (and not in RBD-TMR), thus
pulling down bound RBD-TMR and consequently producing a significant decrease of the
supernatant fluorescence intensity (570-580 nm, Figure 4B). Elution of the complex from the
NTA matrix by addition of 300 mM imidazole caused a strong fluorescence increase in the
soluble fraction, further indicating that (His)6-tagged ACE2 forms a complex with RBD-TMR
(Figure 4C). We concluded that RBD-TMR was capable of interacting with the ACE2 soluble
domain, indicating that the structural features relevant for the interaction are preserved in
recombinant RBD produced in P. pastoris, and that the conditions employed to perform the
transpeptidation reaction to produce RBD-TMR did not affect its tertiary structure.

omitting ACE2. Samples were centrifuged and washed three times and subsequently
incubated in the presence of 1 μM RBD-TMR for 30 min under mild agitation. After
centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and analyzed by fluorescence
spectroscopy (B). The matrix was washed three times and eluted with 300 μL of 20 mM

Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 250 mM imidazole. The sample was centrifuged, and the
supernatant was analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy (C). In B and C black lines
correspond to the incubation in the presence of ACE2, while red lines correspond to the
controls without ACE2. The excitation wavelength was 550 nm, the bandwidths for both
excitation and emission were of 5 nm. All the measurements were made at 25 °C.

Native Sortase A-mediated Coupling of RBD to BLS
Given that recombinant RBD proved to be a good Sortase A substrate, we proceeded to
attempt

the

coupling

of

RBD-Leu-Pro-Glu-Thr-Gly-(His)6

and

TEV-digested

Met-Glu-Asn-Leu-Tyr-Phe-Gln-Gly-Gly-Gly-BLS. The expected product was the covalently
coupled RBD-Leu-Pro-Glu-Thr-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Ser-Gly-BLS (RBD-BLS in Figure
1). The SEC-HPLC profiles (Superose 6 column) corresponding to a BLS multimer, RBD alone
and the reaction product are shown in Figure 5A. The product of the covalent coupling mediated
by Sortase A exhibited an elution time compatible with an increment in the hydrodynamic radius
of the assembly compared to that observed for the decameric BLS (27 and 31.5 min,
respectively). The unreacted BLS decamer and RBD are also clearly distinguishable in the SEC
profile.
Since BLS is a decameric protein, different multiplicities (RBD n/BLS10) can be obtained
depending on the buffer conditions and the stoichiometry of the Sortase A reaction. It was
possible to obtain different multiplicities by controlling RBD and BLS concentration ratios. We
used low RBD and high BLS concentration, to obtain low multiplicities (between 1 and 2 of
RBD copies per multimer, Figure S3), referred as RBD-BLS LM), whereas the higher
multiplicities (referred as RBD-BLS HM) were obtained with higher RBD/BLS ratios (Figure
S3 and Figure 5A).
To determine such multiplicities, and given that the presence of heterogeneous sizes of glycan
moieties in RBD resulted in a high heterogeneity which difficults the analysis, we trimmed the
glycans with endoglycosidase H and resolved the deglycosylated products of the coupling
reaction by SDS-PAGE (Figure 5B, compare lanes 1 and 3 to 2 and 4). The sharp band that
migrates close to the 40 kDa marker in lane 3 corresponds to the covalently coupled RBD-BLS
(26 kDa of deglycosylated RBD +17 kDa of monomeric BLS, 43 kDa, Lane 1). It should be

noted that a large amount of RBD still remains uncoupled (blue arrow in Lane 3), therefore the
efficiency of the reaction still needs to be improved. Additionally, a byproduct (between 15-18
kDa) was observed that still needs to be identified (lanes 3 and 4).
A quantification of the loss of free BLS and the increment of the RBD-BLS band in
SDS-PAGE (and HPLC) allowed us to quantify the yield and the multiplicity (Figure S4), that is
the number of RBD copies per RBD-BLS particle, of the coupling reaction. We have obtained
preliminary yields of 10-30% with average multiplicities between 2 and 4 (RBD2/BLS10 and
RBD4/BLS10, respectively) in preliminary experiments. However, the incorporation of a
concentration step (the reaction made in a centrifugal filter unit (Centricon, Merck Millipore)
with a cutoff of 10 kDa, see Materials and Methods for details) allowed us to enhance the
reaction, yielding in higher multiplicities (between RBD6./BLS10 and RBD7./BLS10, RBD-BLS
HM).
In summary, we succeeded in coupling the eukaryotic-produced RBD antigen with the E.coli
expressed decameric carrier BLS under native conditions. In addition, the possibility of
obtaining RBD-BLS with different multiplicities allowed to study the effect of multiplicity on
the development of the immune response.

(magenta, lower pane). Decameric BLS has a molecular weight of approximately 170 kDa and
each RBD subunit adds approximately 26 kDa or 40 kDa (excluding or including glycosylation,
respectively). The observed multiplicity was ~6.6 (RBD6.6/BLS10) with a yield of ~20%. The
RBD-BLS oligomer eluted at ~25 min. The peak observed between 38-43 min corresponds to
EDTA-Ca2+. Sortase A requires 10 mM CaCl2 for the activation of its catalytic activity, therefore
10 mM EDTA was added to stop the reaction, which was carried out during 240 min at 4 °C. (B)

Once purified by SEC, the coupling product was found to be stable after freezing and
subsequent thawing, and did not show any significant aggregation tendency. In addition, the
product could be easily concentrated, and did not show any apparent interaction with the
concentrator membranes (data not shown). Importantly, the coupling products were also
separated from the Sortase A enzyme by SEC. This is an essential step to avoid reverse
transpeptidation and RBD-Sortase A hydrolysis (that would result in a RBDh product that can
not be recycled by the enzyme)26, which would reduce the global yield of the reaction.

The Immunogenicity of RBD is Increased by Coupling to the BLS multimer.
To assess whether RBD coupled to BLS can improve the immunogenicity of RBD, we
immunized mice with two doses of RBD-BLS HM, RBD-BLS LM and monomeric RBD, 30
days apart (Table 1, Materials and Methods). In addition, RBD and RBD-BLS-HM formulations
were adjuvanted with Al(OH) 3.
The multimeric RBD-BLS HM formulation alone elicited a strong humoral response with
high anti-RBD IgG titers, and when adjuvanted with AL(OH)3 the humoral response increased
6.75 times relative to RBD-BLS HM alone (Figure 6). By contrast, monomeric RBD did not
elicit a significant anti-RBD IgG specific antibody response even in presence of Al(OH) 3. We
also observed that the addition of BLS to monomeric RBD (at the same BLS concentration used
in the case of RBD-BLS HM) slightly improved humoral immune response (RBD + BLS
group).This result suggests that BLS showed some adjuvant ability per se. Furthermore, the
multiplicity of RBD-BLS multimers turned out to be a key variable, since a high multiplicity

elicited strong immune response, while a low multiplicity did not (RBD-BLS LM group,
between 1 and 2 copies of RBD per multimer).
These results clearly show that coupling of RBD to BLS at high multiplicity strongly
enhances RBD immunogenicity, which might be due at least in part to the spatial arrangement of
the RBD subunits in the resulting particles (Figure 1B).

Immunization with BLS-RBD Elicit Antibodies with Neutralizing Activity Against a
SARS-CoV-2 S Pseudotyped Virus Transduction
To analyze the neutralizing activity of immune sera elicited by RBD-BLS immunization, in
vitro neutralization assays using SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped lentiviruses were performed27.
Serial dilutions (1:100; 1:500; 1:2,500; 1:12,500; 1:62,500; 1:312,500; 1:1,562,500;
1:7,812,500) of sera were made in the DMEM medium and incubated with equal amounts of
pseudotyped virus, then added to HEK-293T cells previously transfected with ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 protease. While pseudotyped virus particles were capable of delivering
GFP-encoding RNA into the cells in the presence of preimmune serum, immune sera prevented
transduction, shown as a percentage of inhibition, in a concentration-dependent manner. Sera
from mice immunized with RBD-BLS HM (Table 1), strongly reduced the number of
GFP-expressing cells (Figure 7). Remarkably, immunizations with RBD-BLS HM administered
in the presence of Al(OH)3 adjuvant resulted in significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers
(Figure 7, IC50 values are 8700 and 2132, with and without adjuvant, respectively), as judged by
the significant reduction observed in pseudotyped virus transduction. By contrast, sera from
mice immunized with Pichia pastoris-expressed RBD domain plus BLS (not covalently
coupled) resulted in lower neutralizing antibody titers (IC50 = 356.2, Table 1, RBD + BLS).
Altogether these results show that RBD-BLS HM is a very promising candidate both to
induce neutralizing antibodies in animal models, and as a candidate for a protein-based vaccine.

Discussion
A year ago, just before SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in Argentina, a group of researchers
from different institutions and with different relevant expertises joined forces to help fighting the
ongoing pandemic. Our work aimed to produce the RBD domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,
as it is a useful tool for the serological detection of infected patients, and has the potential to be
used as antigen to develop a low cost vaccine. So far we have successfully produced RBD in
different expression systems, among them in the yeast P. pastoris, which showed biophysical
properties similar to that of RBD expressed in mammalian cells25.
In this work RBD was covalently coupled to a multimeric carrier with the aim of improving
its immunogenicity to develop a useful vaccine candidate. As a carrier we used the multimeric
lumazine synthase protein from Brucella abortus (BLS), which has been previously shown to be

a good antigen carrier for systemic immunization and as mucosal-adjuvant, which makes it a
good candidate to be used for oral subunit vaccines17. We have improved the efficiency of the
RBD-BLS coupling reaction to scale up the production and purification of the RBD-BLS
oligomer, obtaining different multiplicities (1 to 6) and we have compared the immunogenicity
of RBD-BLS vs. RBD in mice.
Our results showed that the RBD-BLS multimer can elicit an increased immune response
compared to that of monomeric RBD, even in the absence of adjuvant. This increase depended
on the covalent coupling of RBD to BLS, as the co-administration of RBD with BLS (i.e. not
covalently coupled) did not induce an equivalent immune response. We also observed that the
multiplicity of RBD coupled to BLS was an important factor in the enhancement of the
immunological response.
In immunological studies we observed that RBD coupled to BLS at a high multiplicity (6-7
RBD copies per BLS decamer) is remarkably more immunogenic than monomeric RBD, or than
RBD coupled to BLS at a low multiplicity (1-2 RBD copies per BLS decamer). An 80-fold
increment in the anti-RBD humoral immune response was observed by RBD-BLS HM
compared to monomeric RBD. By contrast, no significant

humoral immune response was

elicited by monomeric RBD in the presence or absence of Al(OH)3, or by the addition of BLS to
RBD (without covalent coupling). In addition, when Al(OH)3 was added to RBD-BLS HM an
extra 6.75-fold increase in total anti-RBD IgG titer and 4.1 fold increase in sera neutralization
IC50 value was observed.
Whereas BLS is highly resistant to urea-induced unfolding, the decameric structure is
sensitive to low pH (pH 4.0-5.5), or to moderate guanidinium chloride concentrations (2.0 M)28,
which cause the dissociation of the decameric forms to pentamers. In addition, BLS has been
previously modified, and several pentameric variants also exist that could be used to assemble
pentamers, which could then be mixed to obtain the decameric form, taking advantage of surface
complementation that depends on the new side-chain residues on these surfaces29. This makes
BLS a very malleable protein, and would allow, for example, to include different immunogens in
the same protein particle. BLS oligomers carrying different coupled proteins could be
disassembled by incubation at low pH, mixed and reassembled so as to generate a diversity of
homo and hetero decamers. As a Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist, it has been shown that BLS

can stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses, thereby improving vaccine
efficacy17,20. Thus RBD-BLS, alone or in combination with adjuvants, has the potential to boost
T- and B-cell responses against SARS-CoV-2, which deserves further exploration.
The idea of coupling RBD to a multimeric protein to produce a stronger immunogen has been
considered by other groups. Some molecular platforms have been proposed to multimerize CoV
antigens. A very interesting recent work reports the production of particles displaying regions of
the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike protein, by coupling its
RBD domain to a multimeric lumazine synthase (LS), using the SpyTag/SpyCatcher system 30, in
which the peptide SpyTag that includes 13 amino acids reacts with the 12.3 kDa-SpyCatcher
protein31. A similar strategy has been recently developed by Hang and coworkers for
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using both Aquifex aeolicus LS and Helicobacter pylori ferritin as
nanoparticle scaffolds32. They coupled a trimeric version of the antigen to LS, which caused such
nanoparticles to elicit significantly higher neutralizing antibody responses than the spike protein
alone. New strategies to develop novel vaccines against SARS-CoV2 also include
self-assembling fusion proteins. For example, Powell and coworkers have recently prepared in
Expi293F mammalian cells a fusion protein containing the spike ectodomain followed by H.
pylori ferritin, a 19 kDa protein that self-assembles into a 24-subunit nanoparticle33. Of note,
such nanoparticles display eight copies of a trimeric antigen on the surface, as previously used
for haemagglutinin from H1N1 virus34. The authors showed that multivalent presentation of
spike trimers on ferritin can notably increase elicitation of neutralizing antibodies in mice after a
single dose.
In this context, the strategy presented here involving RBD-BLS particles may be considered
as a new useful tool against SARS-CoV-2. The platform is ductile enough to incorporate new
variants like E484K, which has been associated with escape from neutralizing antibodies 35–37 or
N501Y, which is associated with increased binding specificity and faster-growing lineages 38.
This is important given the high chance of having new waves of SARS-CoV-2 involving RBD
mutant viruses.

Materials and Methods
SARS-CoV-2 RBD Protein Expression and Purification
The receptor binding domain of spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 (RBD) was expressed in
Pichia pastoris. The RBD coding sequence (spike amino acid residues 319-537) was fused to the
Saccharomyces cerevisiae alpha factor secretion signal (N-terminal) followed by a C-terminal
Sortase A recognition sequence and a His6 tag (C-terminal) given the C-terminal sequence
RBD-Leu-Pro-Glu-Thr-Gly-(His)6 as previously reported25. The expression was carried out in a
bioreactor as indicated, and the protein was purified with a yield of 150 mg L-1 of culture
supernatant25. RBD concentration was determined by UV spectrophotometry using an absorption
coefficient of 33850 M-1 cm-1.
BLS Expression and Purification
A gene encoding a variant of lumazine synthase of Brucella abortus (BLS) including an
N-terminal TEV site followed by a Gly-Gly-Gly sequence and a Gly-Ser-GLy-Ser-GLy spacer
(Met-Glu-Asn-Leu-Tyr-Phe-Gln-Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser-GLy-Ser-Gly-BLS) was assembled and
cloned in the pET11a vector (Novagen). The construct was checked by sequencing. The protein
was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). Cells were grown in Luria Bertani broth at 37 ºC to OD600
1.0, and protein expression was induced by 1 mM IPTG. Expression was carried out at 28 ºC
overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 20 min and freezed at -20
ºC until use. The cell pellet was resuspended in 20 mL of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and gently
sonicated in an ice-water bath. The sample was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min, and the
soluble fraction was transferred to a fresh tube. The protein was purified in two steps. First the
soluble fraction was loaded onto an anionic exchange chromatographic column (Q-Sepharose,
given that the theoretical pI value of BLS is 6.4). The fractions containing BLS, as judged by
SDS-PAGE analysis, were pooled and loaded onto a size exclusion chromatographic column
(Superdex S200). Fractions containing BLS were pooled and the purified protein was analyzed
by mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE. BLS concentration was determined by UV
spectrophotometry using an absorption coefficient of 18405 M-1 cm-1.

ACE2 Expression and Purification
The expression plasmid pcDNA3-sACE2(WT)-8his, which includes the human ACE2 soluble
domain (residues 1-615) coding gene, followed by a Gly-Ser-Gly linker and eight His residues
for purification, was transfected in HEK-293T mammalian cells. Cells were grown in high
glucose (4.5 g L-1) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Thermo Fisher Scientific)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Natocor), 110 mg L-1 of sodium pyruvate
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units mL-1 and 100 μg mL-1
respectively, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a 37 °C incubator under 5% CO2. Cells were plated
(2x107 cells per 150 mm plate) and grown for 24 h before transfection with Polyethylenimine
(PEI, Sigma). After 72 h, the cell culture medium was centrifuged twice at 12,000 ×g for 20 min
at 4 °C. The supernatant pH was adjusted to pH 8.0 with an equilibration buffer (50 mM sodium
phosphate, 300 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole, pH 8.0). Soluble ACE2 was purified using a
previously equilibrated Ni

cells (starting with a 1/40 dilution of an overnight pre-culture) were grown in Terrific Broth at 37
ºC up to OD600nm of 0.6. Sortase A expression was induced for 5 h at 37 ºC by the addition of 1
mM IPTG. Cells were centrifuged, resuspended, and sonicated in 35 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM
Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole, 10% glycerol). After that the sample was
centrifuged and the soluble fraction loaded in NTA-Ni2+ agarose previously equilibrated with the
lysis buffer. A washing step with 10 column volumes was performed and the elution was carried
out with 2.5 volumes of elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 350 mM
Imidazole, 10% glycerol). Finally, imidazole was removed and the protein was concentrated
using a Centricon (Merck Millipore) and preserved at -80 ºC in small fractions at 2 mM
concentration.
ESI MS for Intact Mass Analysis
The protein samples were analyzed on an LC−ESI-MS platform consisting of a Surveyor MS
pump system (C4 column, Higgins Analytical Proto 300 5µm RS-0301-W045, 30 mm × 1.0
mm) coupled to an electrospray mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan LCQ duo, equipped with
an ion trap mass analyzer). The gradient was 5% solvent B (96% acetonitrile, 2% acetic acid) in
solvent A (2% acetonitrile, 2% acetic acid) for 2 min, 5 to 100 % solvent B in solvent A in 4
min, and 100% solvent B for 8 min at a flow rate of 40 μL min-1. The ESI spectra was
deconvoluted to the zero-charge domain by the ProMass Deconvolution Software (Novatia)
using a standard parameter set: average mass type, mass tolerance 0.02%, minimum tolerance 2

Gly-Gly-GLy-Ser-{Lys-(TMR)}was purchased from Genscript. Its mass, as determined by mass
spectrometry analysis, and excitation and emission spectra were compatible with the predicted
theoretical values. An absorption coefficient of 87500 M-1 cm-1 at 560 nm was used to calculate
the TMR concentration in solution. To evaluate the transpeptidation efficiency, a spectrum of
free TMR was subtracted from the spectrum of protein in order to correct the 280 nm absorbance
value of the protein solution.
Transpeptidation and Multiplicity
The transpeptidation reaction was performed by the Sortase A enzyme. To obtain a product
with high multiplicity (6:10, RBD:BLS) 70 and 35 𝜇M of RBD and BLS respectively were used.
For lower ratios (approximately 2:10, RBD:BLS), 70 and 350 𝜇M of RBD and BLS respectively
were used. The reaction was started by the addition of Sortase A (0.4 𝜇M final concentration
from a 2 mM stock solution preserved at -80 oC). The reaction was performed in a 20 mM
Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM CaCl2 buffer. CaCl2 allowed the activation of Sortase
A, therefore the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 mM EDTA. The reaction previously
treated or not with 5 mU of endoglycosidase H during 1 h at 37 oC was analyzed by SDS-PAGE
and by SEC-HPLC. In order to improve the efficiency and the irreversibility of the

UV-VIS UV-2075 (the elution was monitored at 280 nm).
Interaction between Recombinant RBD and ACE2.
The interaction between the covalently coupled product RBD-TMR and the ACE2 soluble
domain was studied taking advantage of the presence of a (His)6 tag in the C-terminus of ACE2,
which is not present in RBD-TMR. ACE2 (1.0 μM) and RBD-TMR (1.0 μM) were incubated
during 30 min, with gentle agitation in darkness in the presence of NTA-Ni2+ in 20 mM sodium
phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.40. The complex was separated from free RBD-TMR by
centrifugation (1 min at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge). The fluorescence after the
incubation was measured using an excitation wavelength of 560 nm, the emission monitored
between 570 and 670 nm, a 4 nm bandwidth was used for both excitation and emission.
Measurements were performed in a JASCO spectrofluorometer equipped with a thermostated
cell holder connected to a circulating water bath set at 25 ºC. A path length cell of 0.3 cm was
used. Additionally, the complex bound to the NTA matrix was eluted by the addition of
imidazole and the fluorescence of the supernatant was analyzed in the same fashion.
Endotoxin Remotion and Detection
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)42 was removed from the protein preparations by an overnight
incubation (4 ºC) of the proteins with polymyxin B matrix followed by a second incubation (2-3
h) at room temperature. The matrix was previously equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM
NaCl, pH 7.0 buffer solution. We measured the LPS content of purified RBD-BLS preparations
as previously described19. The endotoxin concentration in the protein samples was determined by
Cassará Fundation Laboratories. Briefly, all protein samples were brought to a final volume of
200 μL and the LPS content was measured using a commercial kit from Charles River Endosafe
(R160), based on the Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay chromogenic method, with a
sensitivity of 0.015 EU/ml. No LPS was detected in the RBD-BLS preparation following
endotoxin removal.

from CONICET (STAN No. 4482), under guidelines from the Institutional Committee for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (CICUAL). BALB/c mice were obtained from the animal
facility of the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences, University of La Plata (Argentina), and housed at
the animal facility of the Instituto de Ciencia y Tecnología Dr. César Milstein, Fundación Pablo
Cassará. Six groups of five Females mice (6-8 week-old) (n=5) were immunized subcutaneously
with the same amount of RBD protein (15 µg) coupled or not to BLS in the presence or absence
of 500 µg aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3). Two different BLS coupling formulations were
obtained (Table 1): RBD6.6/BLS10 (high multiplicity, RBD-BLS HM) and RBD1.5/BLS10 (low
multiplicity, RBD-BLS LM). Additionally, uncoupled RBD + BLS formulation (RBD + BLS,
Table 1) was tested with the same equimolar conditions used for the RBD-BLS HM group.
Pre-immune sera also were collected before starting the immunization. Mice received two
immunizations with the same dose at days 0 (antigen prime) and 30 (antigen boost). Additional
control animals were injected with 500 µg Al(OH)3 per mouse with the same immunization
schedule.
Blood samples were obtained at 20 days post-second immunization by venipuncture from the
facial vein. After coagulation at room temperature for 1-2 h, blood samples were spun in a
centrifuge at 3000 rpm/min for 10 min at 4 °C. The upper serum layer was collected and stored
at -20°C.

Identification of Serum Antibody Against Protein RBD in Mice Using an ELISA Assay.
The antibody response against RBD and RBD-BLS was measured using a standard ELISA
procedure. Briefly, flat-bottom 96-well plates (Thermo Scientific NUNC-MaxiSorp) were coated
with recombinant RBD protein produced in P. pastoris at a final concentration of 1 µg/ml (100
µl/well) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) coating buffer (pH 7.4) at 4 °C overnight. After
blocking (8% nonfat dry milk PBS for 2 h at 37 °C) the plates were washed 5 times with PBS
containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). Serially diluted mouse sera were incubated at 37 °C for 90
min in PBS containing 1% non-fat dry milk (blocking solution), and plates were subsequently
washed with PBST. For total specific IgG determination, IgG horseradish peroxidase
(HRP)-conjugated antibody (DAKO P0447) was diluted 1/1000 in blocking solution and added
to the wells. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, plates were washed fivetimes with PBST and
developed with 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbiphenyldiamine (TMB) for 15 min. The reaction was
stopped with 50 µl/well of 1 M H2SO4 (stop solution). The absorbance was measured in a
microplate reader (Thermo Multiscan FC ELISA) at 450 nm.
The antibody titer was determined as the inverse of the last dilution that was considered
positive, with a cut-off value defined as absorbance at 450 nm of 0.20, which was twice as high
as that from a pool of normal mouse sera (from 30 unimmunized animals). Statistical
significance was evaluated by the Student’s t-test, using a logarithmic transformation of the
ELISA titers. Differences were considered significant if p < 0.05.
Pseudotyped Lentivirus Neutralization Assay
SARS-CoV-2 S-Pseudotyped lentivirus27,43 were produced by co-transfection of HEK-293T
cells with plasmids bearing a GFP reporter gene (pLB was a gift from Stephan Kissler, Addgene
plasmid #11619; http://n2t.net/addgene:11619; RRID:Addgene_11619), a lentivirus backbone
(VRC5602, NIH), and the Spike protein (VRC7475_2019-nCoV-S-WT, NIH). Briefly,
HEK-293T cells (2×107) were seeded in a 150-mm tissue culture dish in DMEM medium
containing 10% FBS. The next day, cells were transfected with 10 μg of VRC5602, 5 μg
pLB-GFP, and 3 μg of VRC7475_2019-nCoV-S-WT in OptiMEM medium using PEI in a 1:3
DNA:PEI ratio. Twenty four hours later, transfection efficiency, indicated as GFP fluorescence,
was checked under a fluorescent microscope. Pseudotyped lentivirus supernatants were

harvested 48 h post-transfection and stored at 4 °C, fresh media (DMEM + 5% FBS) was added
to the plates. After 48 h, combined supernatants were clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at
3,000 rpm to pellet the residual cells. The clarified supernatant was centrifuged for 5 h at 10,000
rpm. The pellet was resuspended in a storage medium (OptiMEM + 6% Sucrose) and aliquots
were frozen at -80 °C until use.
Pseudotyped lentivirus titers were measured by transducing HEK-293T cells previously
seeded in 96-well plates (2x104 cells/well) and transiently transfected with 100 ng of ACE2
(NIH) and 10 ng of TMPRSS2 protease (NIH) per well. The pseudotyped virus stock
(concentrated supernatant) was serially diluted in assay medium (DMEM + 2.5% FBS),
incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and added to the transfected cells. Virus titers were calculated by
counting the GFP positive cells using an automated counting tool in ImageJ (NIH), a titer of
200-225 GFP positive cells/field using 100X magnification was used for the assay.
Neutralization assays were performed on HEK-293T cells transiently transfected 24 h before
transduction with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protease genes. Fifty microliters of serial 5-fold diluted
heat-inactivated serum (56 °C for 45 min), starting dilution of 1:100, were prepared in assay
medium and incubated for 2 h with an equal volume of titrated pseudotyped lentivirus.
Pseudovirus and sera dilution mixtures (100 μl) were then added onto 96-well plates containing
2x104 cells/well. Pseudovirus infectivity was scored 48 h later and images were obtained using
an inverted microscope (IX-71 OLYMPUS), and analyzed with the Micro-Manager Open Source
Microscopy Software. Sera antibody neutralization titers were calculated by a nonlinear
regression curve fit using GraphPad Prism software Inc. (La Jolla, CA). Half maximal inhibitory
concentration (IC50), corresponding to the serum antibody dilution causing a 50% reduction of
GFP positive cells compared to control “virus only” treated cells, was determined using the same
software according to Ferrara and Temperton 44.
