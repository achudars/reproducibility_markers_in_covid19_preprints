Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical need for broad-spectrum
therapeutics against respiratory viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major threat to
pediatric patients and the elderly. We describe 4’-fluorouridine (4’-FlU, EIDD-2749), a
ribonucleoside analog that inhibits RSV, related RNA viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 with high
selectivity index in cells and well-differentiated human airway epithelia. Polymerase inhibition
in in vitro RdRP assays established for RSV and SARS-CoV-2 revealed transcriptional pauses at
positions i or i+3/4 post-incorporation. Once-daily oral treatment was highly efficacious at 5
mg/kg in RSV-infected mice or 20 mg/kg in ferrets infected with SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020 or
variant-of-concern (VoC) isolate CA/2020, initiated 24 or 12 hours after infection, respectively.
These properties define 4’-FlU as a broad-spectrum candidate for the treatment of RSV, SARSCoV-2 and related RNA virus infections.
One-Sentence Summary: 4’-Fluorouridine is an orally available ribonucleoside analog that
efficiently treats RSV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in vivo.

The COVID-19 experience has demonstrated that proactively developed orally-bioavailable
broad-spectrum antivirals are likely the best option to allow rapid response to a newly emerging
viral pathogen. Remdesivir, a direct-acting broad-spectrum antiviral, is still the only approved
therapeutic for use against SARS-CoV-2 infection, but its dependence on intravenous
administration has compromised its clinical impact (1). We have demonstrated efficacy of orally
available EIDD-2801 (molnupiravir) against influenza viruses in human organoid models and

ferrets (2), and using the ferret model were subsequently first to show that antiviral efficacy of
molnupiravir extends to SARS-CoV-2 in vivo (3). Initial human data for molnupiravir were
encouraging (4) and the drug is in advanced clinical trials for treatment of COVID-19. However,
even this highly accelerated development timeline reiterates that, to have a substantial impact on
a mounting pandemic, an antiviral must be approved for human use before a new pathogen
emerges.
We have identified RSV disease as a viable primary indication to develop a broad-spectrum
antiviral drug, based on the unmet major health threat imposed by RSV and well-established
protocols for clinical trials of novel anti-RSV therapeutics. RSV infections cause over 58,000
hospitalizations of children below five years of age in the United States annually, and
approximately 177,000 hospitalizations of adults above the age of 65 (5-8). Despite this major
health and economic burden, no therapeutics have been licensed specifically for treatment of
RSV disease (9).
Anti-RSV drug discovery efforts have increasingly focused on inhibiting the viral RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) complex (10). The core polymerase machinery comprises
the large (L) polymerase protein, its obligatory cofactor, the phosphoprotein (P), and the
encapsidated negative-sense RNA genome (10). Allosteric inhibitors of RSV L have
demonstrated potent antiviral activity as seen, for instance, with the experimental drug candidate
AVG-233 (11) and inhaled PC786 (12). However, the antiviral indication spectrum of these
inhibitors is narrowly focused on RSV. To improve future pandemic preparedness, a broadened
activity spectrum reaching beyond the original licensing indication has emerged as an important
objective for the development of next generation antivirals. Narrow therapeutic windows of
acute viral diseases (13) furthermore require drug administration early after infection,
underscoring that next-generation therapeutics against respiratory viruses must be orally
bioavailable to meet the time constraints of effective antiviral therapy.
In search of suitable candidates meeting these objectives, we examined 4’-FlU. The development
of balapiravir, a prodrug of 4’-azidocytidine, against HCV and other flavivirus infections
highlights that 4’-substituted ribonucleosides have antiviral promise (14, 15). Fluorosubstitutions appeared furthermore particularly promising, since the small atomic radius and
strong stereo-electronic effect of fluorine can influence the ribose backbone conformation,
impacting intra- and intermolecular interactions. Having established broad-spectrum antiviral
activity of 4’-FlU in ex vivo models and determined its mechanism of action (MOA), we
validated oral efficacy in two different animal models, the RSV mouse model and the SARSCoV-2 ferret model. This study introduces 4’-FlU as a promising next-generation antiviral
candidate with broad-spectrum potential that may provide a therapeutic option against RSV
disease and aid in increasing pandemic preparedness.

Having recognized the unmet need of RSV disease as a valid primary indication to advance a
novel broad-spectrum antiviral, we assessed activity of 4’-FlU (Fig. 1A) on immortalized HEp-2
cells against a recombinant RSV A2-line19F (recRSV A2-L19F) (16) and clinical RSV isolates.

(Table S1). This cell culture potency was on par with anti-RSV activity of previously reported
NHC (17), the free base of molnupiravir that is currently in clinical development (Fig. S1).
Global metabolic activity of established human and animal cell lines (HEp-2, MDCK, BHK-T7,
BEAS-2B) exposed to up to 500 µM of 4’-FlU remained unaltered (Fig. 1C) (Table S2). When
glucose was replaced with galactose as carbohydrate source to link cell metabolic activity strictly
to mitochondrial oxidation (18), we determined a half-maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of
4’-FlU of 250 µM (Fig. 1C) (Table S2).
When tested on disease-relevant primary human airway epithelial cells (HAE) derived from two
different donors (Fig. 1D), 4’-FlU showed ≥17-fold increased anti-RSV potency but unchanged
low cytotoxicity (CC50 169 µM) (Fig. 1E), resulting in a high selectivity index (SI = EC50/CC50)
of ≥1877. Consistent with these findings, in-cell quantitative immunocytochemistry confirmed
that 4’-FlU similarly reduced steady-state levels of nuclear-(SDH-A; IC50 272.8 µM) and
mitochondrial-(COX-I; IC50 146.8 µM) encoded proteins in HAEs only at high concentrations
(Fig. S2).
Assessment of the broader 4’-FlU indication spectrum against a panel of related major pathogens
of the mononegavirus order, including measles virus (MeV), human parainfluenza virus type 3
(HPIV3), Sendai virus (SeV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and rabies virus (RabV)
consistently demonstrated sub-micromolar active concentrations (Fig. 1F) (Table S1). The
positive-sense RNA betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was apparently only slightly less sensitive to
4’-FlU, with EC50 values ranging from 0.5 to 5.1 µM against isolates of different lineages (Fig.
1G) (Table S1).
An initial mechanistic characterization of 4’-FlU in cell-based minireplicon systems revealed
inhibition of pneumovirus and paramyxovirus RdRP complex activity (Fig. 1H) (Table S1). In
accordance with broad-spectrum activity against mononegavirus, the RdRP activity of Nipah
virus (NiV), a highly pathogenic zoonotic paramyxovirus with strong pandemic potential (19),
was also efficiently inhibited by 4’-FlU in an NiV minireplicon reporter assay. The antiviral
effect of 4’-FlU was dose-dependently reversed by addition of an excess of exogenous
pyrimidines, cytidine and uridine, but not purines, to the cultured cells, which furthermore is
consistent with competitive inhibition of RdRP activity (2) (Fig. 1I).
Incorporation of 4’-FlU by RSV and SARS-CoV-2 RdRP causes a sequence-modulated
transcriptional pause
To characterize the molecular MOA of 4’-FlU, we purified recombinant RSV L and P proteins
expressed in insect cells (Fig. 2A) and characterized the performance of the bioactive 5’triphosphate form of 4’-FlU (4’-FlU-TP) in in vitro primer extension assays (20) (Fig. 2B). In the
presence of radio-labelled ATP and an increasing amount of UTP, purified RSV RdRP
complexes elongated the primer to the third position, which called for CTP, and continued
further upon addition of CTP (Fig. 2C) (Fig. S3) (Data S1). Replacing UTP with 4’-FlU-TP
likewise resulted in efficient primer extension up to the third nucleotide, confirming that RSV
RdRP recognizes and incorporates 4’-FlU as uridine nucleotide (Fig. 2C). Incorporation kinetics
(21) showed a moderate reduction of substrate affinity for 4’-FlU-TP compared to UTP, reflected
by Km values of 24.9 µM versus 6.71 µM (Fig. 2D). These findings confirmed efficient
incorporation of 4’-FlU-TP by RSV RdRP. Further addition of CTP to the reaction mix resulted
in limited elongation to gacgcAA(4’-FlU)CA(4’-FlU)A rather than the expected full-length
gacgcAA(4’-FlU)CA(4’-FlU)AACA, which suggested delayed chain termination by
incorporated 4’-FlU (Fig. 2C) (Data S1).

When a modified template called for incorporation of only a single UTP (Fig. 2E)(Data S1), we
noted accumulation of signal at position i+3 after 4’-FlU-TP, whereas the efficiency of full
primer elongation (i+7) was strongly reduced compared to extension after UTP. However,
repositioning the incorporation site further downstream in the template triggered polymerase
pause at position i (Fig. S4), suggesting template sequence dependence of the inhibitory effect.
Transcription pauses at i or i+3 were also observed after multiple 4’-FlU incorporations: a
UxUxxx template (Fig. 2F) and direct tandem incorporations (Fig. S4) caused termination at
position i, whereas increasing spacer length between the uridines to two, three, or four
nucleotides resulted in increasingly pronounced pausing at i+3 (Fig. S4). This sequencedependent, variable delayed polymerase termination within one to four nucleotides of the
incorporation site was equally prominent when we examined de novo initiation of RNA synthesis
at the promoter using a synthetic native RSV promoter sequence rather than extension of primertemplate pairs (Fig. S5).
Purification of a core SARS-CoV-2 polymerase complex (non-structural proteins (nsp) 7, 8 and
12) from bacterial cell lysates (Fig. 2G) and assessment of RdRP bioactivity in equivalent
primer-extension in vitro polymerase assays (Fig. 2H) demonstrated incorporation of 4’-FlU-TP
in place of UTP by the coronavirus RdRP (Fig. 2I), again with no sign of direct chain
termination. While transcriptional pauses of SARS-CoV-2 RdRP were less noticeable than with
RSV RdRP upon incorporation of 4’-FlU, polymerase pausing and/or termination was again
triggered after multiple incorporations of 4’-FlU-TP in a sequence-dependent manner, and were
particularly prominent when subsequent incorporation of 4’-FlU-TP occurred at i+4 position
(Fig. 2J) (Fig. S6). No primer extension occurred when the nsp12 subunit was omitted or an
nsp12 variant carrying mutations in the catalytic site was used, confirming specificity of the
reaction (Fig. S6) (Data S1).
4’-FlU is rapidly anabolized, metabolically stable, and potently antiviral in disease-relevant
well-differentiated HAE cultures
Quantitation of 4’-FlU and its anabolites in primary HAE cells after exposure to 4’-FlU for
different times (Fig. 3A) demonstrated rapid intracellular accumulation of 4’-FlU, reaching a
level of 3.42 nmol/million cells in the first hour of exposure (Fig. 3B). Anabolism to bioactive
4’-FlU-TP was likewise efficient, resulting in concentrations of 10.38 nmol/million cells at peak
(4 hours after exposure start) and 1.31 nmol/million cells after 24 hours at plateau. Subsequent
wash-out of the compound revealed high metabolic stability of the anabolite, which remained
present in sustained concentrations of approximately 1 nmol/million cells over a 6-hour
monitoring period, corresponding to an extrapolated half-life of 9.7 hours (Fig. 3C).
To explore efficacy in a disease-relevant human tissue model, we cultured the HAEs at air-liquid
interface, inducing the formation of a well-differentiated 3D epithelium that mimicked hallmarks
of a human airway epithelium, including ciliated and mucus-producing cells (22) (Fig. 3D).
When added to the basolateral chamber of the transwells after apical infection of the epithelium
with RSV, 4’-FlU potently reduced apically shed progeny virus titers with an EC50 of 55 nM
(Fig. 3E). Overall titer reduction spanned nearly four orders of magnitude, ranging from
3.86×104 TCID50 in the presence of vehicle volume equivalents to 78.18 TCID50 at 5 µM
basolateral 4’-FlU, which approached the level of detection.
Confocal microscopy validated formation of a pseudostratified organization of the epithelium
with tight junctions in the airway epithelium tissue model (Fig. 3F), visualized efficient RSV
replication in vehicle-treated tissue models (Fig. 3G), and confirmed near-sterilizing antiviral

conditions, positive staining for RSV antigen was rarely detected.

To test 4’-FlU efficacy in vivo, we employed the mouse model of RSV infection, challenging
animals with recRSV-A2-L19F, which efficiently replicates in mice (16). In a dose-to-failure
study, we infected BALB/cJ mice intranasally and initiated once-daily oral treatment two hours
after infection at 0.2, 1, or 5 mg 4’-FlU/kg body weight. Treatment at all dose levels resulted in a
statistically significant reduction in lung virus load compared to vehicle-treated animals (Fig.
4A). The antiviral effect was dose-dependent and approached nearly two orders of magnitude at
the 5 mg/kg dose level, the greatest reduction that we have ever observed in this model (17).
Consistent with the observed high metabolic stability in HAEs, a twice-daily dosing regimen did
not significantly enhance efficacy (Fig. S9). Since animal appearance, body weight, temperature
(Fig. S10), and relative lymphocyte and platelet counts (Fig. 4B) (Fig. S11) were unchanged in
the 5 mg/kg group compared to vehicle-treated animals, we selected this dose level for the
following studies.
For a longitudinal assessment of therapeutic benefit in individual animals, we employed an in
vivo imaging system (IVIS) using a red-shifted luciferase-expressing RSV reporter virus (23)
that we had generated for this study to maximize signal intensity. Daily imaging (Fig. 4C) (Fig.
S12) revealed significant reduction of bioluminescence intensity in lungs of 4’-FlU-treated
animals, independent of whether treatment was initiated 24 hours prior to, or 1 hour after,
infection (Fig. 4D). This IVIS profile is consistent with reduced viral replication and ameliorated
viral pneumonia in the treated animals.
To probe the therapeutic window of 4’-FlU, we initiated treatment at 2, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours
after infection. All treatment groups showed a statistically significant reduction of lung virus
burden compared to vehicle-treated animals, but effect size was dependent on the time of
treatment initiation (Fig. 4E) (Fig. S13). Based on our experience with therapeutic intervention
with related respiratory RNA viruses that cause lethal disease (22), we consider a reduction of
lung virus load of at least one order of magnitude required for robust therapeutic benefit. With
this request, the therapeutic window of 4’-FlU extended to 24 hours after infection in mice.

We next tested efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020 in the HAE organoid models grown at
air-liquid interface. Independent of the human donor, SARS-CoV-2 replicated efficiently in these
disease-relevant tissue models (Fig. 5A-C)(Fig. S14). Treatment of the infected cultures with
basolateral 4’-FlU dose-dependently reduced apical virus shedding, albeit approximately 45-fold
less potently (EC50: 2.47 µM) than inhibition of RSV and with a limited maximal effect size of
approximately two orders of magnitude at 50 µM (Fig. 5D). Confocal microscopy revealed that
most of the epithelium was negative for staining of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein under
these conditions (Fig. 5E), with only sporadic exceptions of a small number of remaining
infected ciliated cells (Fig. 5F)(Fig. S14).
To assess whether this reduction in viral shedding translates to a significant benefit in vivo, we
determined efficacy of oral 4’-FlU against 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 (WA1/2020, A lineage)
and the VoC isolate 2019-nCoV/USA/CA_CDC_5574/2020 (CA/2020, B.1.1.7 lineage) in the
ferret model, which recapitulates hallmarks of uncomplicated human infection (3). For informed

dose level selection in ferrets, we first determined single oral dose ferret pharmacokinetic (PK)
profiles of 4’-FlU. When administered at 15 or 50 mg/kg, peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) of
4’-FlU reached 34.8 and 63.3 µM, respectively, and overall exposure was 154 ± 27.6 and 413.1 ±
78.1 h´nmol/ml, respectively, revealing good oral dose-proportionality (Fig. 6A) (Table S3).
Based on this PK performance, we selected once-daily dosing at 20 mg/kg body weight for
efficacy tests (Fig. 6B).
Intranasal infection of ferrets with 1´105 PFU of either WA1/2020 or CA/2020 resulted in rapid
viral shedding into the upper respiratory tract. An upper plateau of shed virus was reached in
vehicle-treated animals 48 hours after infection at 1.2×104 PFU/ml and 2.3×102 PFU/ml nasal
lavage, respectively (Fig. 6C). Therapeutic treatment with 4’-FlU initiated 12 hours after
infection caused a significant reduction in shed virus burden by approximately three orders of
magnitude (WA1/2020) to less than 50 PFU/ml nasal lavage and one order of magnitude
(CA/2020), respectively, within 12 hours of treatment onset. Virus loads remained low for the
remainder of the study. Viral titers in nasal turbinate tissue extracted four days after infection
(Fig. 6D) and associated viral RNA copy numbers (Fig. S15) correlated with this reduction in
shed virus load. Shedding of infectious particles ceased completely in all animals after 2.5 days
of treatment (three days post-infection). These results demonstrate that once-daily oral
administration of 4’-FlU efficiently suppresses replication of the original WA1/2020 SARSCoV-2 isolate and the more recently emerged CA/2020 B.1.1.7 lineage in a relevant animal
model.
Discussion

25

30

Our anti-RSV efforts have yielded 4’-FlU, an orally efficacious ribonucleoside analog inhibitor
with broad-spectrum activity against negative sense RNA viruses of the pneumovirus,
rhabdovirus, and paramyxovirus families, which includes the highly pathogenic henipaviruses
that carry high pandemic threat potential (19). In vitro RdRP assays identified polymerase
pausing or delayed chain-termination as the primary MOA of 4’-FlU, which is reminiscent of the
antiviral effect of remdesivir (24, 25). In contrast to remdesivir, however, 4’-FlU also induced an
immediate RdRP stall after incorporation in a sequence-dependent manner. These properties
suggest steric hindrance of the RdRP to advance after incorporation of the compound or to
accommodate the next incoming nucleotide as the underlying antiviral mechanism of 4’-FlU.

40

Albeit with reduced potency, activity of 4’-FlU extended to the positive-sense RNA
betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The somewhat lower sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to the
compound compared to RSV could be due to the exonuclease activity of the coronavirus
polymerase complex, which reportedly can eliminate ribonucleoside analogs (26, 27). However,
SARS-CoV-2 polymerase also showed a higher tendency to advance further along the template
after 4’-FlU-TP incorporation than RSV RdRP in the in vitro RdRP assays, which do not contain
the exonuclease functionality. Accordingly, coronavirus RdRP may also have a somewhat
greater capacity to tolerate incorporated 4’-FlU and continue polymerization than mononegavirus
polymerase complexes.

45

Since no small-animal model of RSV infection fully recapitulates all aspects of human RSV
disease (28), we employed two complementary infection models to assess antiviral efficacy of
4’-FlU, ex vivo HAE cultures and the in vivo mouse model. Results revealed consistent antiviral
efficacy in both systems, indirectly confirming also efficient anabolism in disease-relevant
primary human tissues, oral bioavailability of the compound in mice, and accumulation of

bioactive 4’-FlU-TP at efficacious levels in mouse lung. Ferret PK profiles validated that 4’-FlU
exposure levels are high and dose-proportional after oral administration. Although RSV is
known to advance rapidly to viral pneumonia in mice, therapeutic treatment with 4’-FlU
demonstrated a 24-hour therapeutic window after infection. Since RSV host invasion is slower in
humans (29), these data support that a viable therapeutic window should exist for efficacious
treatment of human RSV infection.
When comparing activity of 4’-FlU against SARS-CoV-2 and RSV in cultured cells and welldifferentiated HAEs, anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency was overproportionally lower in the organoid
models. RSV tropism in the organoids is restricted to ciliated cells (30, 31), whereas SARSCoV-2 can reportedly be found in both ciliated and goblet cells (32-37). Conceivably, 4’-FlU
anabolism efficiency could be higher in ciliated than in goblet cells, affecting anti-SARS-CoV-2
impact in this system. Importantly, however, once-daily oral treatment of ferrets infected with
WA1/2020 or the recently emerged VoC CA/2020 reduced virus burden to an almost
undetectable level within 12 hours of treatment initiation. These data confirm broad-spectrum
anti-coronavirus efficacy of 4’-FlU in a relevant animal model and suggest that 4’-FlU has
greater potential to remain active against future VoCs that may be less responsive to spiketargeting vaccines or antibody therapeutics.
Formal tolerability studies with 4’-FlU are still pending, but the compound was well tolerated by
the human organoid models and efficacious in murids and mustelids. Blood analysis of treated
mice revealed no global changes in blood cell counts, indicating that treatment had no negative
effect on the hematopoietic system. These results establish 4’-FlU as a much-needed novel
broad-spectrum antiviral with confirmed efficacy against major RNA virus pathogens, making it
a promising therapeutic option for severe RSV disease and an important contributor to further
improving pandemic preparedness.
