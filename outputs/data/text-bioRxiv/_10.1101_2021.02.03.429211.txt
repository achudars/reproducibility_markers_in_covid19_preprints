Summary

21

Non-integrative, non-cytopathic and non-inflammatory lentiviral vectors are particularly suitable for

22

mucosal vaccination and recently emerge as a promising strategy to elicit sterilizing prophylaxis against

23

SARS-CoV-2 in preclinical animal models. Here, we demonstrate that a single intranasal administration of

24

a lentiviral vector encoding a prefusion form of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein induces full protection of

25

respiratory tracts and totally avoids pulmonary inflammation in the susceptible hamster model. More

26

importantly, we generated a new transgenic mouse strain, expressing the human Angiotensin Converting

27

Enzyme 2, with unprecedent brain permissibility to SARS-CoV-2 replication and developing a lethal

28

disease in <4 days post infection. Even though the neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2 is now well established,

29

so far other vaccine strategies under development have not taken into the account the protection of central

30

nervous system. Using our highly stringent transgenic model, we demonstrated that an intranasal booster

31

immunization with the developed lentiviral vaccine candidate achieves full protection of both respiratory

32

tracts and brain against SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

40

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome beta-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of

41

pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), hence the imminent necessity to develop effective and

42

safe prophylactic vaccines. We have recently established the high performance of lentiviral vector (LV)-

43

based vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in pre-clinical animal models (Ku et al., 2021). Our reported

44

COVID-19 LV-based vaccine candidate is currently in progress to proceed to clinical trial. Both integrative

45

(ILV) and non-integrative (NILV) forms of LV allow transgene insertion up to 8kb in length and offer

46

outstanding potential of gene transfer to the nuclei of host cells (Di Nunzio et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2011; Ku

47

et al., 2020; Zennou et al., 2000). LVs display in vivo tropism for immune cells, notably dendritic cells

48

(Arce et al., 2009, our unpublished data). They are non-replicative, non-cytopathic and scarcely

49

inflammatory (unpublished data). These vectors induce long-lasting B- and T-cell immunity (Di Nunzio et

50

al., 2012; Hu et al., 2011; Ku et al., 2020; Zennou et al., 2000). LV are pseudo-typed with the surface

51

glycoprotein of Vesicular Stomatitis Virus, to which the human population has limited exposure, avoiding

52

these vectors to be targeted by preexisting immunity in humans, which is in net contrast to adenoviral

53

vectors (Rosenberg et al., 1998; Schirmbeck et al., 2008). The safety of LV has been established in human

54

in a phase I/II Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 vaccine trial (2011-006260-52 EN).

55

“LV::SFL” encodes the full-length sequence of the surface class I fusion spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-

56

CoV-2 (SCoV-2) that is able to elicit strong neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) and CD8+ T-cell responses against

57

a large spectrum of SCoV-2 MHC-I-restricted epitopes (Ku et al., 2021). Notably, a systemic prime, followed

58

by intranasal (i.n.) boost with LV::SFL is associated with a robust prophylactic effect against lung SARS-

59

CoV-2 replication, accompanied by strong reduction of infection-derived lung inflammation and tissue

60

injury. These observations have been made in mice in which the expression of human Angiotensin-

61

Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) was induced in the respiratory tracts by instillation of an adenoviral vector

62

serotype 5 (Ad5::hACE2), or in the highly susceptible Mesocricetus auratus, i.e., outbred golden hamsters.

63

These results indicated the requirement for i.n. boost and induction of mucosal adaptive immunity to reach

64

almost sterilizing lung protection against SARS-CoV-2 (Ku et al., 2021).

65

Although lung is the organ of predilection for SARS-CoV-2, its neurotropism, similar to that of SARS-

66

CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, (Glass et al., 2004; Li et al., 2016; Netland et

67

al., 2008) has been reported (Aghagoli et al., 2020; Fotuhi et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020;

68

Politi et al., 2020; Roman et al., 2020; von Weyhern et al., 2020; Whittaker et al., 2020). Moreover,

69

expression of ACE2 in neuronal and glial cells has been described (Chen et al., 2020; Xu and Lazartigues,

70

2020). Accordingly, COVID-19 human patients can present symptoms like headache, myalgia, anosmia,

71

dysgeusia, impaired consciousness and acute cerebrovascular disease (Bourgonje et al., 2020; Hu et al.,

72

2020; Mao et al., 2020). Analysis of autopsies of COVID-19 deceased patients demonstrated presence of

73

SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharynx and brain, and virus entry into central nervous system (CNS) via neural-

74

mucosal interface of olfactory mucosa (Meinhardt et al., 2020). These observations align with the previous

75

report of viruses capable of gaining access to the brain through neural dissemination or hematogenous route

76

(Desforges et al., 2014). Therefore, it is critical to focus hereinafter on the protective properties of COVID-

77

19 vaccine candidates, not only in the respiratory tracts, but also in the brain.

78

Contribution of SCoV-2 is instrumental in host cell invasion through cellular attachment and membrane

79

fusion subsequent to engagement with hACE2 (Walls et al., 2020). Following this interaction, the

80

extracellular domain of the metastable prefusion SCoV-2 is cleaved at the 682RRAR685 site of subtilisin-like

81

protease furin (Guo et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020). This gives rise to: (i) S1 subunit, harboring the ACE2

82

Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) that harbors main B-cell epitopes targeted by NAbs (Walls et al., 2020),

83

and (ii) S2 subunit, containing the membrane-fusion machinery. This cleavage leads to substantial

84

conformational rearrangements resulting in a highly stable post-fusion form of SCoV-2 that initiates the

85

fusion reaction with the host cell membrane (Sternberg and Naujokat, 2020). Similar to envelop

86

glycoproteins of several other viruses that harbor furin cleavage site, including respiratory syncytial virus,

87

HIV, Ebola virus, human metapneumovirus, and Lassa virus (Bos et al., 2020). It is possible to engineer

88

SCoV-2 to limit its conformational dynamics and avoid the stabilization under its prefusion conformation to

89

maintain better exposure of the S1 B-cell epitopes and improve immunogen availability (McCallum et al.,

90

2020).

91

Here, we first demonstrated that a single i.n. administration of an LV encoding a prefusion form of SCoV-

92

2

93

protection against SARS-CoV-2 in the pre-clinical hamster model. A single i.n. injection of this LV was as

94

protective as a systemic prime followed by an i.n. boost in these animals. More importantly, we generated

95

a new hACE2 transgenic mouse strain with unprecedent permissibility of the brain to SARS-CoV-2

96

replication. Using this unique preclinical animal model, we demonstrated the importance of i.n. booster

97

immunization with the developed LV-based vaccine candidate to reach full protection of not only lungs but

98

also CNS against SARS-CoV-2. Our results indicated that i.n. vaccination with non-cytopathic and non-

99

inflammatory LV is a performant and safe strategy to elicit sterilizing immunity in the main anatomical

100

was as protective as a systemic prime followed by an i.n. boost by conferring sterilizing pulmonary

sites affected by COVID-19.

Results

103

Adaptive Immunity Elicited by LV::SDF2P in Comparison to LV::SFL

104

We generated LV encoding a prefusion form of SCoV-2 under transcriptional control of the

105

cytomegalovirus promoter. This prefusion SCoV-2 variant (SDF2P) has a deletion of 675QTQTNSPRRAR685

106

sequence. This deletion encompasses the polybasic RRAR furin cleavage site situated at the junction of

107

S1/S2 subunits, and harbors K986P and V987P consecutive proline substitutions in S2, within the hinge loop

108

between heptad repeat 1 and the central helix (Figure S1A) (Walls et al., 2020). Both ILV::SDF2P- and

109

ILV::SFL-primed (i.m.) and -boosted (i.n.) C57BL/6 mice possessed high serum titers of anti-SCoV-2 IgG

110

(Figure S1B) and high titers of anti-SCoV-2 IgG and IgA in their lung extracts (Figure S1C), indicating that

111

the modifications in the pre-fusion SDF2P form does not impact positively or negatively its capacity to induce

112

Abs against native SCoV-2.

113

Sterilizing protection in hamster model by a single i.n. NILV::SDF2P administration

114

We recently showed that despite induction of high serum neutralizing activity, systemic immunization

115

with ILV::SFL or NILV::SFL conferred significant but partial protection against SARS-CoV-2. In contrast,

116

vaccination by systemic prime followed by i.n. boost with ILV::SFL or NILV::SFL induced almost sterilizing

117

lung protection (Ku et al., 2021). Here, we first assessed the prophylactic effect of vaccination with only a

118

single i.n. administration of NILV::SDF2P in the hamster model.

119

Hamsters (n = 6/group) were: (i) primed i.m. at wk 0 with 1 × 108 TU of NILV::SDF2P and boosted i.n.

120

at wk 5 with the same amount of the vector, as a positive protection control, (ii) immunized i.n. with a

121

single injection of 1 × 108 TU of NILV::SDF2P at wk 0, or (iii) at wk 5 (Figure 1A). Sham-vaccinated controls

122

received equivalent amounts of an NILV::GFP via i.n. at wks 0 and 5. Comparable and high titers of anti-

123

SCoV-2 IgG Abs were detected in the sera in the first two groups at wk 5 (Figure 1B). At wk 7, the serum

124

Ab titer was maintained at a high level in the NILV::SDF2P i.m.-i.n. group while it was slightly decreased in

125

some individuals of the “NILV::SDF2P i.n. wk 0” group. At this time point, in the “NILV::SDF2P i.n. wk 5”

126

group, lower serum Ab titers were detected (Figure 1B). Although the virus neutralization activity was

127

significantly lower in the sera of “NILV::SDF2P i.n. wk 5” hamsters compared to the NILV::SDF2P i.m.-i.n.

128

group, the former had an equivalent neutralizing capacity in their lung homogenates (Figure 1C).

129

At wk 7, all animals were challenged i.n. with 0.3 × 105 TCID50 of a SARS-CoV-2. At 4 days post

130

inoculation (dpi), only 2-3% weight loss was detected in the NILV::SDF2P-vaccinated groups, compared

131

to 12% in sham-vaccinated hamsters (Figure 1D). At this time point, as determined by qRT-PCR detecting

132

SARS-CoV-2 Envelop (ECoV-2) RNA, ~ 2-to-3 log10 decreases were observed in NILV::SDF2P-vaccinated

133

individuals of either i.m.-i.n. or single i.n. groups, compared to sham-vaccinated group (Figure 1E).

134

Assessment of lung viral load by a sub-genomic ECoV-2 RNA (Esg) qRT-PCR, which was reported to be

135

an indicator of active viral replication (Chandrashekar et al., 2020; Tostanoski et al., 2020; Wolfel et al.,

136

2020) (Tostanoski et al., 2020), showed total absence of replicating virus in the three vaccinated groups

137

versus a mean ± SD of (1.24 ± 0.99) × 109 copies of Esg RNA of SARS-CoV-2/lungs in the sham-

138

vaccinated group (Figure 1E). Many publications use PFU counting to determine viral loads. We noticed

139

that large amounts of NAbs in the lungs of vaccinated individuals, even though not necessarily spatially

140

in contact with circulating viral particles in alive animal, can come to contact with and neutralize viral

141

particles in the lung homogenates in vitro. In this case the PFU assay underestimates the amounts of

142

cultivable viral particles (Figure S2A).

143

At 4 dpi, as evaluated by qRT-PCR in total lung homogenates, a substantial decreased in inflammation

144

was detected in NILV::SDF2P-vaccinated hamsters compared to their sham-vaccinated counterparts,

145

regardless of the immunization regimen, i.e., i.m.-i.n. prime-boost or single i.n. injection given at wk 0 or

146

5 (Figure 2A). On lung histopathological examination, sham-vaccinated controls demonstrated lung

147

infiltration and interstitial syndrome (Figure 2B-D), severe alveolo-interstitial inflammation leading to

148

dense pre-consolidation areas (Figure 2E), accompanied by bronchiolar lesions, with images of

149

bronchiolar epithelium desquamation into the lumen (Figure 2F-H). In vaccinated groups the lesions were

150

minimal, although some degree of alveolar infiltration could be seen (Figure 2I).

151

These data collectively indicated that a single i.n. administration of NILV::SDF2P was as protective as a

152

systemic prime and i.n. boost regimen, conferred sterilizing pulmonary immunity against SARS-CoV-2

153

and readily prevented lung inflammation and pathogenic tissue injury in the susceptible hamster model.

154

These data also showed the long-term feature of the conferred protection because 7 weeks after a single

155

injection of the vaccine, the protection potential remained complete.

156
157

Generation of new hACE2 transgenic mice with substantial brain permissibility to SARS-CoV-2
replication

158

No hACE2 transgenic mice were available in Europe until September 2020. To set up a mouse model

159

permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication allowing assessment of our vaccine candidates, based on the

160

previously produced B6.K18-ACE22Prlmn/JAX mice (McCray et al., 2007), we generated C57BL/6 transgenic

161

mice with an LV (Nakagawa and Hoogenraad, 2011) carrying the hACE2 gene under the human cytokeratin

162

18 promoter, namely “B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV”. The permissibility of these mice to SARS-CoV-2 replication

163

was evaluated after one generation backcross to WT C57BL/6 (N1). N1 mice with varying number of

164

hACE2 transgene copies per genome (Figure 3A) were sampled and inoculated i.n. with SARS-CoV-2

165

(Figure 3B). At 3 dpi, the mean ± SD of lung viral loads was as high as (3.3 ± 1.6) × 1010 copies of SARS-

166

CoV-2 RNA/lung in permissive mice (Figure 3B). SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies per lung <1 × 107 correspond

167

to the genetic material derived from the input in the absence of viral replication (Ku et al., 2021). We also

168

noted that the lung viral loads (Figure 3B) were not proportional to the hACE2 transgene copy number per

169

genome (Figure 3A). Remarkably, substantial viral loads, i.e., (5.7 ± 7.1) × 1010 copies of SARS-CoV-2

170

RNA, were also detected in the brain of the permissive mice (Figure 3B). Virus replication/dissemination

171

was also observed, although to a lower extent, in the heart and kidneys.

172

We further compared the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in lungs and brain and the viral dissemination to

173

various organs in B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV and B6.K18-ACE22Prlmn/JAX mice (McCray et al., 2007) (Figure

174

3C). The lung viral loads were slightly lower in B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV compared to B6.K18-ACE22Prlmn/JAX

175

mice. However, viral loads in the brain of B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV mice were substantially higher compared

176

to their B6.K18-ACE22Prlmn/JAX counterparts (Figure 3C). Measurement of brain viral loads by Esg qRT-

177

PCR detected (7.55 ± 7.74) × 109 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV mice and no copies

178

of this replication-related RNA in 4 out of 5 B6.K18-ACE22Prlmn/JAX mice. This substantial difference of

179

SARS-CoV-2 replication in the brain of both transgenic strains was corroborated with significantly higher

180

hACE2 mRNA expression in the brain of B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV mice (Figure 3D). However, hACE2 mRNA

181

expression in the lungs of B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV mice was also higher than in B6.K18-ACE22Prlmn/JAX mice,

182

which does not account for the lower viral replication in the lungs of the former. A trend towards higher

183

viral loads was also observed in the kidneys and heart of B6.K18-hACE2IP-ThV compared to B6.K18-

184

ACE22Prlmn/JAX mice (Figure 3C).

185

In concordance with the lung viral loads, as evaluated by qRT-PCR applied to total lung homogenates,

186

B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV mice displayed less pulmonary inflammation than B6.K18-ACE22Prlmn/JAX mice

187

(Figure 3E). Remarkably, this assay applied to total brain homogenates detected substantial degrees of

188

inflammation in B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV — but not in B6.K18-ACE22Prlmn/JAX — mice (Figure 3E). In

189

addition, B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV mice reached the humane endpoint between 3 and 4 dpi and therefore

190

displayed a lethal SARS-CoV-2-mediated disease more rapidly than their B6.K18-ACE22Prlmn/JAX

191

counterparts (Winkler et al., 2020).

192

Therefore, the large permissibility to SARS-CoV-2 replication at both lung and CNS, marked brain

193

inflammation and rapid development of a lethal disease are major distinctive features offered by this new

194

B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV transgenic model.

195

Full protection of lungs and brain in LV::SDF2P-immunized B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV mice

196

We then evaluated the vaccine efficacy of LV::SDF2P in B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV mice. In a first

197

experiment with these mice, we used an integrative version of the vector. Individuals (n = 6/group) were

198

primed i.m. with 1 × 107 TU/mouse of ILV::SDF2P or an empty LV (sham) at wk 0 and then boosted i.n.

199

at wk 3 with the same dose of the same vectors (Figure 4A). Mice were then challenged with SARS-CoV-

200

2 at wk 5. A high serum neutralizing activity, i.e., EC50 mean ± SD of 5466 ± 6792, was detected in

201

ILV::SDF2P-vaccinated mice Figure 4B). This vaccination conferred substantial degrees of protection

202

against SARS-CoV-2 replication, not only in the lungs, but also in the brain (Figure 4C). Notably,

203

quantitation of brain viral loads by Esg qRT-PCR detected no copies of this replication-related SARS-

204

CoV-2 RNA in ILV::SDF2P-vaccinated mice versus (7.55 ± 7.84) × 109 copies in the brain of the sham-

205

vaccinated controls.

206

At 3 dpi, cytometric investigation of the lung innate immune cell subsets (Figure 4D, S3A) detected

207

significant decrease in the proportions of NK (CD11bint NKp46+) cells and neutrophils (CD11b+ CD24+

208

SiglecF- Ly6G+) among the lung CD45+ cells in the ILV::SDF2P-vaccinated and protected B6.K18-

209

hACE2IP-THV mice, compared to the sham-vaccinated and unprotected controls (Figure 4D). Frequencies

210

of the other lung innate immune cells were not significantly distinct in the protected and unprotected

211

groups (Figure S3B). At 3 dpi, as evaluated by qRT-PCR applied to brain homogenates, ILV::SDF2P-

212

vaccinated B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV mice had significant decreases in the expression levels of IFN-a, TNF-

213

a, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, CCL2, CCL3, CXCL9 and CXCL10, compared to the sham group (Figure

214

4E). Furthermore, no noticeable changes in the lung inflammation were recorded between the two groups

215

(Figure S3C).

216

Therefore, an i.m.-i.n. prime-boost with ILV::SDF2P prevents SARS-CoV-2 replication in both lung and

217

CNS anatomical areas and inhibits virus-mediated lung infiltration and pathology and neuro-

218

inflammation.

219

Requirement of i.n. boost for full protection of brain in B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV mice

220

To go further in characterization of the protective properties of LV, in the following experiments in

221

B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV mice, similar to the hamster model, we used the safe and non-integrative version of

222

LV. The observed protection of brain against SARS-CoV-2 may reflect the benefits of i.n. route of LV

223

administration against this respiratory and neurotropic virus. To address this question, B6.K18-hACE2IP-

224

THV

225

or (iii) i.m. wk 5. Sham-vaccinated controls received i.n. an empty NILV at wks 0 and 5 (Figure 5A). Mice

226

were then challenged with SARS-CoV-2 at wk 7 and viral loads were determined in the brain by E- or Esg-

227

specific qRT-PCR at 3dpi (Figure 5B). In this highly stringent pre-clinical model, even performant, a single

228

i.n. or i.m. injection of NILV::SDF2P did not induce full protection in all animals of each group. Only i.m.

229

prime followed by i.n. boost conferred full protection in all animals, showing the requirement of an i.n.

230

boost to reach full protection of brain. The brain protection levels were proportional to plasma anti-SCoV-2

231

IgG titers (Figure 5C). As analyzed by cytometry, composition of innate and adaptive immune cells in the

232

cervical lymph nodes were unchanged in NILV::SDF2P i.m.-i.n. protected group, sham i.m.-i.n. unprotected

233

group and untreated controls (data not shown). However, we detected increased proportion of CD8+ T cells

in the olfactory bulb of NILV::SDF2P i.m.-i.n. protected group compared to the sham unprotected group

235

(Figure 5D). CD4+ T cells in the olfactory bulb had no distinctive activated or migratory phenotype, as assessed

236

by their surface expression of CD69 or CCR7, respectively. In line with the absence of CCR7 expression on

237

these T cells, and unlike the case of Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV) infection (Cupovic et al., 2016), we did

238

not detect up-regulation of CCL19 and CCL21 chemo-attractants (CCR7 ligands) in the brain and

239

regardless of the mouse protection status (Figure 5E). Compared to NILV::SDF2P i.m.-i.n. protected group,

240

increased amount of neutrophils (CD11b+ Ly6C+ Ly6G+) in the olfactory bulb (Figure 5F) and inflammatory

241

monocytes (CD11b+ Ly6C+ Ly6G-) in the brain (Figure 5G) of unprotected mice, compared to NILV::SDF2P

242

i.m.-i.n. protected group. The presence of these cells is a biomarker of inflammation and therefore,

243

correlated with active viral replication.

244

Collectively, our data generated in the highly stringent B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV mouse model support the

245

advantage of NILV::SDF2P i.n. boost in the immune protection of CNS from SARS-CoV-2 replication and

246

the resulting infiltration and neuro-inflammation. Therefore, local induction and/or activation of mucosal

247

immune response in the nasal cavity and olfactory bulbs, i.e. one of the potential entry points for the virus,

248

emerges as a performant strategy.

Discussion

250

LV-based platform emerges recently as a powerful vaccination approach against COVID-19, notably

251

when used in systemic prime followed by mucosal i.n. boost, able to induce sterilizing immunity against

252

lung SARS-CoV-2 infection in preclinical animal models (Ku et al., 2021). In the present study, we first

253

demonstrated that a single i.n. administration of an LV encoding the SDF2P prefusion form of SCoV-2 confers,

254

as efficiently as an i.m. - i.n. prime-boost regimen, full protection of lungs in the highly susceptible hamster

255

model, as evaluated by virological, immunological and histopathological parameters. The hamster ACE2

256

ortholog interacts efficaciously with SCoV-2, which readily allows host cell invasion by SARS-CoV-2 and

257

its high replication rate. With rapid weight loss and development of severe lung pathology subsequent to

258

SARS-CoV-2 inoculation, this species provides a sensitive model to evaluate the efficacy of drug or vaccine

259

candidates, for instance compared to Rhesus macaques which develop only a mild COVID-19 pathology

260

(Munoz-Fontela et al., 2020; Sia et al., 2020). The fact that a single i.n. LV administration, either seven or

261

two weeks before SARS-CoV-2 challenge, elicits sterilizing lung protection in this susceptible model is

262

valuable in setting the upcoming clinical trials with this LV-based vaccine and could provide remarkable

263

socio-economic advantages for mass vaccination. The long-termed protection conferred, i.e., at least 7

264

weeks after a single injection, is another major advantage of this vaccine strategy to be translated in humans.

265

To further investigate the efficacy of our vaccine candidates, we generated a new transgenic mouse

266

model, using the LV-based transgenesis approach (Nakagawa and Hoogenraad, 2011). The ILV used in

267

this strategy encodes for hACE2 under the control of the cytokeratin K18 promoter, i.e., the same promoter

268

as previously used by Perlman’s team to generate B6.K18-ACE22Prlmn/JAX mice (McCray et al., 2007), with

269

a few adaptations to the lentiviral FLAP transfer plasmid. However, the new B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV mice

270

have certain distinctive features, as they express much higher levels of hACE2 mRNA in the brain and

271

display markedly increased brain permissibility to SARS-CoV-2 replication, in parallel with a substantial

272

brain inflammation and development of a lethal disease in <4 days post infection. These distinct

273

characteristics can arise from differential hACE2 expression profile due to: (i) alternative insertion sites of

274

ILV into the chromosome compared to naked DNA, and/or (ii) different effect of the Woodchuck

275

Posttranscriptional Regulatory Element (WPRE) versus the alfalfa virus translational enhancer (McCray et

276

al., 2007), in B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV and B6.K18-ACE22Prlmn/JAX animals, respectively. Other reported

277

hACE2 humanized mice expressing the transgene under: (i) murine ACE2 promoter, without reported

278

hACE2 mRNA expression in the brain (Yang et al., 2007), (ii) “hepatocyte nuclear factor-3/forkhead

279

homologue 4” (HFH4) promoter, i.e., “HFH4-hACE2” C3B6 mice, in which lung is the principal site of

280

infection and pathology (Jiang et al., 2020; Menachery et al., 2016), and (iii) “CAG” mixed promoter, i.e.

281

“AC70” C3H × C57BL/6 mice, in which hACE2 mRNA is expressed in various organs including lungs and

282

brain (Tseng et al., 2007). Comparison of AC70 and B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV mice could yield information to

283

assess the similarities and distinctions of these two models. However, here we report much higher brain

284

permissibility of B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV mice to SARS-CoV-2 replication, compared to B6.K18-

285

ACE22Prlmn/JAX mice. The B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV murine model not only has broad applications in COVID-

286

19 vaccine studies, but also provides a unique rodent model for exploration of COVID-19-derived

287

neuropathology. Based on the substantial permissibility of the brain to SARS-CoV-2 replication and

288

development of a lethal disease, this pre-clinical model can be considered as a far more stringent than the

289

golden hamster model.

290

The source of neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 in patients with comorbid

291

conditions can be: (i) direct impact of SARS-CoV-2 on CNS, (ii) infection of brain vascular endothelium

292

and, (iii) uncontrolled anti-viral immune reaction inside CNS. ACE2 is expressed in human neurons,

293

astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, located in middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex, which

294

may explain the brain permissibility to SARS-CoV-2 in patients (Song et al., 2020). Previous reports have

295

demonstrated that respiratory viruses can invade the brain through neural dissemination or hematogenous

296

route (Desforges et al., 2014). Besides that, the direct connection of olfactory system to the CNS via frontal

297

cortex also represents a plausible route to invade the brain (Mori et al., 2005). Neural transmission of viruses

298

to the CNS can occur as a result of direct neuron invasion through axonal transport in the olfactory mucosa.

299

Subsequent to intraneuronal replication, the virus spreads to synapses and disseminate to anatomical CNS

300

zones receiving olfactory tract projections (Koyuncu et al., 2013; Zubair et al., 2020; Berth, 2009; Koyuncu

301

et al., 2013; Román et al., 2020). However, the detection of viral RNA in CNS regions without connection

302

with olfactory mucosa suggests existence of another viral entry into the CNS, including migration of SARS-

303

CoV-2-infected immune cells crossing the hemato-encephalic barrier or direct viral entry pathway via CNS

304

vascular endothelium (Meinhardt et al., 2020). Although at steady state, viruses cannot penetrate to the

305

brain through an intact blood-brain barrier (Berth, 2009), inflammation mediators which are massively

306

produced during cytokine/chemokine storm, notably TNF‐α and CCL2, can disrupt the integrity of blood-

307

brain barrier or increase its permeability, allowing paracellular blood-to-brain transport of the virus or virus-

308

infected leukocytes (Aghagoli et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2011).

309

The use of the highly stringent B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV mice demonstrated the importance of i.n. booster

310

immunization for inducing sterilizing protection of CNS by the LV-based vaccine candidate developed

311

against SARS-CoV-2. Olfactory bulb may control viral CNS infection through the action of local innate

312

and adaptive immunity (Durrant et al., 2016). In line with these observations, we detected increased

313

frequencies of CD8+ T cells at this anatomically strategic area in i.m.-i.n. vaccinated and protected mice.

314

In addition, substantial reduction in the inflammatory mediators was also found in the brain of the i.m.-i.n.

315

vaccinated and protected mice, as well as decreased proportions of neutrophils and inflammatory

316

monocytes respectively in the olfactory bulbs and brain. Regardless of the mechanism of the SARS-CoV-

317

2 entry to the brain, we provide evidence of the full protection of the CNS against SARS-CoV-2 by i.n.

318

booster immunization with NILV::SDF2P.

319

We recently demonstrated the strong prophylactic capacity of LV::SFL at inducing sterilizing protection

320

in the lungs against SARS-CoV-2 infection (Ku et al., 2021). In the present study, moving toward a human

321

clinical trial, we used LV encoding stabilized prefusion SDF2P forms of SCov-2. The choice of SDF2P in this

322

study was based on data indicating that stabilization of viral envelop glycoproteins at their prefusion forms

323

improve the yield of their production as recombinant proteins in industrial manufacturing of subunit

324

vaccines, and the efficacy of nucleic acid-based vaccines by raising availability of the antigen under its

325

optimal immunogenic shape (Hsieh et al., 2020). The prefusion stabilization approach has been so far

326

applied to S protein of several coronaviruses, including HKU1-CoV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV.

327

Stabilized SMERS-CoV has been shown to elicit much higher NAb responses and protection in pre-clinical

328

animal models (Hsieh et al., 2020). We detected no difference between the capacity of SFL and SDF2P at

329

inducing anti-SCoV-2 IgG or IgA Ab responses in the sera or lung homogenates of LV-immunized animals.

330

However, the possibility that the yield of LV::SDF2P production at industrial level is higher is likely.

331

The sterilizing protection of the lungs conferred by a single i.n. administration and the full protection of

332

CNS conferred by i.n. boost is an asset of primary importance. The non-cytopathic and non-inflammatory

333

LV encoding either full length, or stabilized forms of SCoV-2, from either ancestral or emerging variants of

334

SARS-CoV-2 provides a promising COVID-19 vaccine candidate of second generation. Protection of the

335

brain, so far not directly addressed by other vaccine strategies, has to be taken into the account, considering

336

the multiple and sometimes severe neuropathological manifestations associated with COVID-19.

Methods

425

Construction and production of LV::SDF2P

426

A codon-optimized SDF2P sequence (1-1262) (Table S1) was amplified from pMK-RQ_S-2019-nCoV

427

and inserted into pFlap by restriction/ligation between BamHI and XhoI sites, between the native human

428

ieCMV promoter and a mutated Woodchuck Posttranscriptional Regulatory Element (WPRE) sequence.

429

The atg starting codon of WPRE was mutated (mWPRE) to avoid transcription of the downstream truncated

430

“X” protein of Woodchuck Hepatitis Virus for safety concerns (Figure S4). Plasmids were amplified and

431

used to produce LV as previously described (Ku et al., 2021).

432

Hamsters

433

Male Mesocricetus auratus golden hamsters (Janvier, Le Genest Saint Isle, France) were purchased

434

mature and weighed between 100 to 120 gr at the beginning of the experiments. Hamsters were housed in

435

individually-ventilated cages under specific pathogen-free conditions during the immunization period. For

436

SARS-CoV-2 infection they were transferred into individually filtered cages placed inside isolators in the

437

animal facility of Institut Pasteur. Prior to i.m. or i.n. injections, hamsters were anesthetized by isoflurane

438

inhalation or i.p. injection of Ketamine (Imalgene, 80 mg/kg) and Xylazine (Rompun, 5 mg/kg).

439

Mice

440

Female C57BL/6JRj mice (Janvier, Le Genest Saint Isle, France) were used between the age of 7 and

441

12 wks. Transgenic B6.K18-ACE22Prlmn/JAX mice (JAX stock #034860) were from Jackson Laboratories

442

and were a kind gift of Dr Jean Jaubert and Dr Xavier Montagutelli (Institut Pasteur). Transgenic B6.K18-

443

hACE2IP-THV mice were generated and bred, as detailed below at the CIGM of Institut Pasteur. During the

444

immunization period female or male transgenic mice were housed in individually-ventilated cages under

445

specific pathogen-free conditions. Mice were transferred into individually filtered cages in isolator for

446

SARS-CoV-2 inoculation at the Institut Pasteur animal facilities. Prior to i.n. injections, mice were

447

anesthetized by i.p. injection of Ketamine (Imalgene, 80 mg/kg) and Xylazine (Rompun, 5 mg/kg).

448

Mouse Transgenesis

449

The human K18 promoter (GenBank: AF179904.1 nucleotide 90 to 2579) was amplified by nested PCR

450

from A549 cell lysate, as described previously (Chow et al., 1997; Koehler et al., 2000). The “i6x7” intron

451

(GenBank: AF179904.1 nucleotide 2988 to 3740) was synthesized by Genscript. The K18JAX (originally

452

named K18i6x7PA) promoter includes the K18 promoter, the i6x7 intron at 5′ and an

453

enhancer/polyadenylation sequence (PA) at 3’ of the hACE2 gene. TheK18 IP-ThV promoter, instead of PA,

454

contains the stronger wild-type WPRE element at 3 ’of the hACE2 gene. In contrast to K18JAX construct

455

which harbors the 3’ regulatory region containing a polyA sequence, the K18IP-ThV construct takes benefice

456

of the polyA sequence already present within the 3’ Long Terminal Repeats (LTR) of the lentiviral plasmid.

457

The i6x7 intronic part was modified to introduce a consensus 5’ splicing donor and a 3’ donor site sequence.

458

The AAGGGG donor site was further modified for the AAGTGG consensus site. Based on a consensus

459

sequence logo (Dogan et al., 2007), the poly-pyrimidine tract preceding splicing acceptor site

460

(TACAATCCCTC in original sequence GenBank: AF179904.1 and TTTTTTTTTTT in K18JAX) was

461

replaced by CTTTTTCCTTCC to limit incompatibility with the reverse transcription step during

462

transduction. Moreover, original splicing acceptor site CAGAT was modified to correspond to the

463

consensus sequence CAGGT. As a construction facility, a ClaI restriction site was introduced between the

464

promoter and the intron. The construct was inserted into a pFLAP plasmid between the MluI and BamHI

465

sites. hACE2 gene cDNA was introduced between the BamHI and XhoI sites by restriction/ligation.

466

Integrative LV::K18-hACE2 was produced as described in (Ku et al., 2021) and concentrated by two cycles

467

of ultracentrifugation at 22,000 rpm 1h 4°C.

468

ILV of high titre (4.16 × 109 TU/ml) carrying K18-hACE2IP-THV was used in transgenesis by subzonal

469

micro-injection under the pellucida of fertilized eggs, and transplantation into the pseudo-pregnant

470

B6CBAF1 females. LV allows particularly efficient transfer of the transgene into the nuclei of the fertilized

471

eggs (Nakagawa and Hoogenraad, 2011). At N0 generation, ≈ 11% of the mice, i.e., 15 out of 139, had at

472

least one copy of the transgene per genome. Eight N0 hACE2+ males were crossed with female WT

473

C57BL/6 mice. At N1 generation, ≈ 62% of the mice, i.e., 91 out of 147, had at least one copy of the

474

transgene per genome.

475

Genotyping and quantitation of hACE2 gene copy number/genome in transgenic mice

476

Genomic DNA (gDNA) from transgenic mice was prepared from the tail biopsies by phenol-chloroform

477

extraction. Sixty ng of gDNA were used as a template of qPCR with SYBR Green using specific primers

478

listed in Table S2. Using the same template and in the similar reaction plate, mouse pkd1 (Polycystic Kidney

479

Disease 1) and gapdh were also quantified. All samples were run in quadruplicate in 10 µl reaction as

480

follows: 10 min at 95°C, 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 30 sec at 60°C. To calculate the transgene copy

481

number, the 2−ΔΔCt method was applied using the pkd1 as a calibrator and gapdh as an endogenous control.

482

The 2−ΔΔCt provides the fold change in copy number of the hACE2 gene relative to pkd1 gene.

483

Ethical Approval of Animal Studies

484

Experimentation on mice and hamsters was realized in accordance with the European and French

485

guidelines (Directive 86/609/CEE and Decree 87-848 of 19 October 1987) subsequent to approval by the

486

Institut Pasteur Safety, Animal Care and Use Committee, protocol agreement delivered by local ethical

487

committee (CETEA #DAP20007, CETEA #DAP200058) and Ministry of High Education and Research

491

ELISPOT and anti-S IgG or IgA Abs were detected by ELISA by use of recombinant stabilized SCoV-2.

492

NAb quantitation was performed by use of SCoV-2 pseudo-typed LV, as previously described (Anna et al.,

493

2020; Sterlin et al., 2020). The qRT-PCR quantification of inflammatory mediators in the lungs and brain

494

of hamsters and mice was performed in total RNA extracted by TRIzol reagent, as recently detailed (Ku et

495

al., 2021). CCL19 and CCL21 expression were measured using the following primer pairs: forward primers

496

were 5’-CTG CCT CAG ATT ATC TGC CAT-3’ for CCL19 and 5’- AAG GCA GTG ATG GAG GGG-

497

3’ for CCL21; reverse primers were 5’- AGG TAG CGG AAG GCT TTC AC -3’ for CCL19 and 5’- CGG

498

GGT AAG AAC AGG ATT G -3’ for CCL21.

499

SARS-CoV-2 inoculation

500

Hamsters or transgenic B6.K18-hACE2IP-THV or B6.K18-ACE22Prlmn/JAX were anesthetized by i.p.

501

injection of Ketamine and Xylazine mixture, transferred into a biosafety cabinet 3 and inoculated i.n. with

502

0.3 × 105 TCID50 of the BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020 SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate (Lescure et al.,

503

2020). This clinical isolate was a gift of the National Reference Centre for Respiratory Viruses hosted by

504

Institut Pasteur (Paris, France), headed by Pr. van der Werf. The human sample from which this strain was

505

isolated has been provided by Dr. Lescure and Pr. Yazdanpanah from the Bichat Hospital, Paris, France.

506

Mice or hamsters were inoculated i.n. with 20 µl or 50 µl of viral inoculum, respectively. Animals were

507

housed in an isolator in BioSafety Level 3 animal facilities of Institut Pasteur. The organs recovered from

508

the infected animals were manipulated according to the approved standard procedures of these facilities.

509

Determination of viral loads in the organs

510

Organs from mice or hamsters were removed aseptically and immediately frozen at -80°C. RNA from

511

circulating SARS-CoV-2 was prepared from lungs as recently described (Ku et al., 2021). Briefly, lung

512

homogenates were prepared by thawing and homogenizing of the organs using lysing matrix M (MP

513

Biomedical) in 500 μl of ice-cold PBS in an MP Biomedical Fastprep 24 Tissue Homogenizer. RNA was

514

extracted from the supernatants of lung homogenates centrifuged during 10 min at 2000g. These RNA

515

preparations were used to determine viral loads by E-specific qRT-PCR.

516

Alternatively, total RNA was prepared from lungs or other organs by addition of lysing matrix D (MP

517

Biomedical) containing 1 mL of TRIzol reagent and homogenization at 30 s at 6.0 m/s twice using MP

518

Biomedical Fastprep 24 Tissue Homogenizer. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent

519

(ThermoFisher). These RNA preparations were used to determine viral loads by Esg-specific qRT-PCR,

520

hACE2 expression level or inflammatory mediators.

521

SARS-CoV-2 E gene (Corman et al., 2020) or E sub-genomic mRNA (Esg mRNA) (Wolfel et al., 2020),

522

was quantitated following reverse transcription and real-time quantitative TaqMan® PCR, using

523

SuperScriptTM III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR System (Invitrogen) and specific primers and probe

524

(Eurofins) (Table S3). The standard curve of Esg mRNA assay was performed using in vitro transcribed

525

RNA derived from PCR fragment of “T7 SARS-CoV-2 Esg mRNA”. The in vitro transcribed RNA was

526

synthesized using T7 RiboMAX Express Large Scale RNA production system (Promega) and purified by

527

phenol/chloroform extraction and two successive precipitations with isopropanol and ethanol.

528

Concentration of RNA was determined by optical density measurement, diluted to 109 genome

529

equivalents/μL in RNAse-free water containing 100μg/mL tRNA carrier, and stored at -80°C. Serial

530

dilutions of this in vitro transcribed RNA were prepared in RNAse-free water containing 10μg/ml tRNA

531

carrier to build a standard curve for each assay. PCR conditions were: (i) reverse transcription at 55°C for

532

10 min, (ii) enzyme inactivation at 95°C for 3 min, and (iii) 45 cycles of denaturation/amplification at 95°C

533

for 15 s, 58°C for 30 s. PCR products were analyzed on an ABI 7500 Fast real-time PCR system (Applied

534

Biosystems).

535

Cytometric analysis of immune lung and brain cells

536

Isolation and staining of lung innate immune cells were largely detailed recently (Ku et al., 2021).

537

Cervical lymph nodes, olfactory bulb and brain from each group of mice were pooled and treated with 400

538

U/ml type IV collagenase and DNase I (Roche) for a 30-minute incubation at 37°C. Cervical lymph nodes

539

and olfactory bulbs were then homogenized with glass homogenizer while brains were homogenized by

540

use of GentleMacs (Miltenyi Biotech). Cell suspensions were then filtered through 100 μm-pore filters,

541

washed and centrifuged at 1200 rpm during 8 minutes. Cell suspensions from brain were enriched in

542

immune cells on Percoll gradient after 25 min centrifugation at 1360 g at RT. The recovered cells from

543

lungs were stained as recently described elsewhere (Ku et al., 2021). The recovered cells from brain were

544

stained by appropriate mAb mixture as follows. (i) To detect innate immune cells: Near IR Live/Dead

545

(Invitrogen), FcγII/III receptor blocking anti-CD16/CD32 (BD Biosciences), BV605-anti-CD45 (BD

546

Biosciences), PE-anti-CD11b (eBioscience), PE-Cy7-antiCD11c (eBioscience), (ii) to detect NK,

547

neutrophils, Ly-6C+/- monocytes and macrophages: Near IR DL (Invitrogen), FcγII/III receptor blocking

548

anti-CD16/CD32 (BD Biosciences), BV605-anti-CD45 (BD Biosciences), PE-anti-CD11b (eBioscience),

551

IR Live/Dead (Invitrogen), FcγII/III receptor blocking anti-CD16/CD32 (BD Biosciences), APC-anti-

552

CD45 (BD), PerCP-Cy5.5-anti-CD3 (eBioscience), FITC-anti-CD4 (BD Pharmingen), BV711-anti-CD8

553

(BD Horizon), BV605-anti-CD69 (Biolegend), PE-anti-CCR7 (eBioscience) and VioBlue-Anti-B220

554

(Miltenyi). Cells were incubated with appropriate mixtures for 25 minutes at 4°C, washed in PBS

555

containing 3% FCS and fixed with Paraformaldehyde 4% by an overnight incubation at 4°C. Samples were

556

acquired in an Attune NxT cytometer (Invitrogen) and data analyzed by FlowJo software (Treestar, OR,

557

USA).

Samples from the lungs or brain of hamsters or transgenic mice were fixed in formalin for 7 days and

560

embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections (5-µm thick) were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E).

561

Histopathological lesions were qualitatively described and when possible scored, using: (i) distribution

562

qualifiers (i.e., focal, multifocal, locally extensive or diffuse), and (ii) a five-scale severity grade, i.e., 1:

563

minimal, 2: mild, 3: moderate, 4: marked and 5: severe.
