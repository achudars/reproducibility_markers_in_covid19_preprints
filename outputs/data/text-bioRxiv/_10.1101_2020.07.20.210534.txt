Abstract
Recent emergence of SARS-CoV2 and associated COVID-19 pandemic has posed a great
challenge for the scientific community. Understanding various aspects of SARS-CoV2 biology,
virulence and pathogenesis as well as determinants of immune response have become a global
research priority. In this study, we performed bioinformatic analyses on SAR-CoV2 protein
sequences, trying to unravel biologically important similarities between this newly emerged virus
with other RNA viruses. Comparing the proteome of SARS-CoV2 with major positive and
negative strand ssRNA viruses showed significant homologies between SARS-CoV2 spike protein
with pathogenic paramyxovirus fusion proteins. This ‘spike-fusion’ homology was not limited to
SARS-CoV2 and it existed for some other pathogenic coronaviruses; nonetheless, SARS-CoV2
spike-fusion homology was orders of magnitude stronger than homologies observed for other
known coronaviruses. Moreover, this homology did not seem to be a consequence of general
ssRNA virus phylogenetic relations. We also explored potential immunological significance of
this spike-fusion homology. Spike protein epitope analysis using experimentally verified data
deposited in Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) revealed that the majority of spike’s T cell epitopes
as well as many B cell and MHC binding epitopes map within the spike-fusion homology region.
Overall, our data indicate that there might be a relation between SARS-CoV2 and paramyxoviruses
at the level of their surface proteins and this relation could be of crucial immunological importance.

Introduction
Current COVID-19 pandemic which is caused by a newly discovered betacoronavirus has led to
immense health and socio-economic problems around the world. First human coronaviruses were
discovered in 1960s, but human coronavirus infections have likely existed for millennia (1-3). In
the first few decades after their discovery, and when compared with other major viral pathogens
like smallpox, polio and influenza, coronaviruses seemed to display a more benign attitude towards
their hosts. Nonetheless, emergence of three deadly coronavirus epidemics over the last 20 years
has challenged this view and is likely indicative of a new dynamism in the evolution of these
pathogens (4, 5). This necessitates investigations that can provide more insight regarding
coronavirus genes, proteins and biological behavior. Complex relations exist between viral
pathogens at various evolutionary, epidemiological and pathogenic levels. One approach towards
better understanding of a new pathogen is comparative analysis of its nucleic acids, proteins and
molecular structures. The results of these types of analyses can go beyond ordinary phylogenetics
and molecular biology and might have applied clinicopathological implications.
SARS-CoV2 nucleic acid and protein sequences did become available shortly after the start of
COVID-19 pandemic and biological aspects of these genes/proteins including their interactions
with immune system are under intense investigation. Recently, several reports have suggested that
immunization against other human pathogens might influence susceptibility to SARS-CoV2. Live
bacterial and viral vaccines including BCG, polio and MMR have been suggested as candidates
that might give rise to this potential ‘cross-protective’ phenomenon (6-9). Considering the
phylogenetic disparity between mycobacteria and RNA viruses, the effects of BCG have been
mostly attributed to alterations at the level of innate immunity; i.e. immune-training (9). However,

beneficial effects of unrelated viral vaccines might be due to innate or adaptive immune
mechanisms, the latter being a consequence of similar antigenic structures.
In this study, we performed a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis on SARS-CoV2 protein
sequences to determine whether there might be any biologically significant similarities between
SARS-CoV2 proteins with non-coronavirus ssRNA viruses. We performed protein homology
searches for individual SARS-CoV2 proteins against protein sequences from all major ssRNA
virus families. This reveled some interesting similarities between SARS-CoV2 spike protein and
paramyxovirus surface proteins as well as a SARS-CoV2 non-structural protein with Togaviruses.
Considering the importance of spike proteins in viral infectivity and immune response, we then
performed more extensive analyses on other coronavirus spike proteins as well as analyses to
determine potential immunological significance of these homologies.

Methods
Extracting SARS-CoV2 and other coronavirus protein sequences
SARS-CoV2 Reference Protein sequences were obtained from NCBI Protein database
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein). SARS-CoV2 RefSeq accession numbers and their
associated official gene games are shown in Supplemental Table 1. Sequences for the surface
proteins of various alpha, beta, gamma and delta-coronaviruses were also obtained from NCBI
Protein database (Supplemental Table 2).
Protein homology searches

Protein sequence homology searches were performed for all SARS-CoV2 proteins against major
positive and negative strand ssRNA virus families using BLASP and Delta-BLAST algorithms.
To detect and report the strongest homologies, best E value-alignment score pairs were extracted
for each query. Likewise, protein homology searches were performed for spike proteins of alpha,
beta, delta and gamma coronaviruses against ssRNA virus families. Results were shown as
negative log10 of E values.
Determining SARS-CoV2 spike protein epitopes and their distribution
Peptide sequences from SARS-CoV2 spike protein which could act as B cell or T cell epitopes or
MHC binders were determined using immune epitope database (IEDB). Experimentally verified
epitopes were obtained by searching the IEDB database with SARS-CoV2 spike protein. Linear
epitopes were considered that had exact matches with substrings of SARS-CoV2 spike protein
sequence. Pairwise BLASTP search was used to find the distribution of these epitopes on spike
protein.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis was performed using RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) protein
sequences from different ssRNA viruses. RdRP sequences from representative positive strand and
negative strand ssRNA viruses were obtained from NCBI Protein Database. Multiple sequence
alignment (MSA) and phylogenetic analysis were performed using MEGA X and PhyML(10).
MUSCLE algorithm was used to perform MSA between sequences. Maximum likelihood (ML)
model selection was performed using “Smart Model Selection in PhyML” (SMS) (11).
Phylogenetic tree construction was performed in PhyML and MEGAX. Generated trees were
tested by 100X bootstrapping.

Results
Comparing SARS-CoV2 proteome with other RNA viruses reveals significant homologies
SARS-CoV2 is a member of betacoronaviruses, which belong to positive sense ssRNA family of
viruses (12). To investigate potential molecular similarities between this virus and other ssRNA
viruses, we first compared all of SARS-CoV2 proteins (38 RefSeq proteins, Supp Table 1) with
protein sequences from major positive strand ssRNA virus families including Picornaviridae,
Flaviviridae, Togaviridae and Caliciviridae. As described in the Methods section, BLASTP and
Delta-BLAST algorithms were used to perform the comparisons and best E value/homology scores
were determined for each SARS-CoV2 protein. As shown in Figure 1, homology searches showed
significant similarities (E values below 1E-30) between SARS-CoV2 non-structural protein 3
(nsp3) as well as orf1a polyprotein (which contains nsp3) with Togavirus proteins (Figure 1a). Far
less significant homologies were observed for SARS-CoV2 helicase (E values around 1E-5) with
proteins from members of Togaviridae (Figure 1a). When compared with Picornaviridae and
Caliciviridae, strongest homologies belonged to SARS-CoV2 helicase, with E values around 1E3 (Figure 1b, 1c). No significant homologies could be detected with members of Flaviviridae (data
not shown). We next compared SARS-CoV2 proteins with major negative strand ssRNA virus
families, i.e. Paramyxoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae and Filoviridae. Homology
searches against Paramyxoviridae showed a striking homology between SARS-CoV2 spike
protein and fusion proteins of various paramyxoviruses (Figure 1d). Comparison with
Orthomyxoviridae and Rhabdoviridae showed very limited homologies (Figure 1e, f), and
comparisons with Filoviridae did not show any significant similarities (data not shown). As shown
in Figure 2a, observed homologies for nsp3-Togavirus and spike-Paramyxovirus homologies
(hereafter named Spike-Fusion) were substantially stronger than other homologies. We then

performed homology searches between SARS-CoV2 nsp3 against members of Togaviridae which
are known human pathogens. As shown in Figure 2b, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus
(VEEV) followed by rubella virus, Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) and Eastern equine
encephalitis viruses (EEEV) showed highest log E value-scores. Similar comparisons were done
for SARS-CoV2 spike versus Paramyxoviridae which are human pathogens. Here, measles virus
followed by henipaviruses showed greatest homologies (Figure 2c). Delta-BLAST alignments for
SARS-CoV2 spike versus measles morbillivirus fusion protein and SARS-CoV2 nsp3 versus
VEEV nsp3 are shown in Supplemental Figures 1 and 2. Entire taxonomy report for Delta-BLAST
results for nsp3-togavirus and spike-paramyxovirus (i.e. Spike-Fusion) comparisons are shown in
Supplemental Tables 3 and 4.

Coronaviridae spike proteins show different degrees of homology with paramyxoviruses
Considering that coronavirus spike proteins are important players in cell entry as well as anti-viral
immune responses, we focused the rest of this work on spike proteins. We asked whether the
observed similarity between spike protein and paramyxovirus fusion proteins is limited to SARSCoV2 or that it is a general phenomenon among coronaviruses. To answer this question, we
compiled a list of viruses representative of alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronaviruses and
obtained their spike protein sequences from NCBI protein database (Supplemental Table 2). We
next performed Delta-BLAST searches for each of these spike proteins against Paramyxoviridae
protein sequences. Our analyses showed that Spike-Fusion homologies do exist for some other
beta and alpha coronaviruses and to a much more limited degree for gamma and delta
coronaviruses (Figure 3). Before the emergence of SARS-CoV2, pathogenic human
betacoronaviruses included highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as far less

pathogenic OC43 and HKU1. When compared with paramyxoviruses, two highly pathogenic
coronaviruses (i.e. SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV) showed a much higher degree of homology with
paramyxovirus surface proteins, compared with homologies observed for MERS-CoV, HKU1 and
OC43 (Figure 3, red bars). Of note, SARS-CoV2’s spike homology was much stronger (E value ~
1E-28) than SARS-CoV (E value ~ 1E-9). One animal coronavirus, i.e. Bat CoV BM48 also
showed a high degree of similarity with Paramyxoviridae fusion proteins, albeit with a less
significant E value compared with SARS-CoV2 (E value ~ 1E-15).
Among alphacoronaviruses, strongest homologies belonged to alpha-Bat CoV followed by
CDPHE15 Bat CoV and human 229E (Figure 3, blue bars). Coronaviruses express three proteins
at their surface; S (spike), E (envelope) and M (membrane). To determine whether homologies
might also exist for the latter two proteins, we performed similar analyses for all coronavirus E
and M proteins against paramyxoviruses. No significant similarities with paramyxoviruses were
observed for either E or M proteins (data not shown).

Spike-paramyxovirus homology regions might bear immunological significance
Protein sequence similarities between different pathogens might have phylogenetic, pathogenic
and immunological implications. Considering that spike protein is a target for humoral immune
responses, we asked whether observed homology between SARS-CoV2 spike and
paramyxoviruses might have any potential immunological importance. Considering that it is a
recently emerged pathogen, SARS-CoV2 protein epitopes are not yet fully known. However, a
substantial body of experimental work has been performed on related SARS-CoV antigens. To
find immunologically important regions in SARS-CoV2 spike protein, we searched Immune

Epitope Database (IEDB) using SARS-CoV2 spike protein sequence. We looked for exact
substring matches in spike protein with experimentally verified B cell, T cell or MHC binding
epitopes (Supplemental Tables 5-7). As shown in Table 1, 33 B cell, 9 T cell and 65 MHC binding
exact epitope matches were found in SARS-CoV2 spike protein. We next determined the
distribution of these epitopes inside spike protein, using pairwise BLASTP search. As shown in
Figure 4a, most B cell epitopes were concentrated in two regions of spike protein; a stretch of
amino acids from 950-1050 and another stretch from 1150 to 1200. This first stretch coincided
with ‘Spike-Fusion’ homology region. Similarly, when we looked at the distribution of T cell
epitopes, 5 out of 9 IEDB T cell epitopes mapped within the homology region (Figure 4b). Of
MHC binding peptides, 23 out of 65 peptide were located inside homology region. Overall, these
findings point to potential importance of Spike-Fusion homology region in stimulating humoral
and cellular immune responses.

Observed SARS-CoV2 Spike-Fusion homologies do not follow the general pattern of
ssRNA virus phylogenetic relations
The most likely explanation for similarities between nucleic acid or protein sequences from various
microorganisms is ‘shared ancestry’. To examine whether observed similarities between SARSCoV2 spike and paramyxovirus surface proteins are a function of shared ancestry, we performed
phylogenetic analyses on various members of ssRNA viruses. The protein sequence of RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) is widely used for performing phylogenetic studies on RNA
viruses. Representative pathogenic viruses were selected from each group (shown in Supplemental
Table 8) and relevant RdRP sequences were obtained from NCBI Protein Database. Phylogenetic
analysis using Maximum Likelihood method showed separate clusters for the majority of positive

strand ssRNA versus negative strand ssRNA viruses (Figure 5). Of note, members of
Coronaviridae were clustered separately from Paramyxoviridae based on RdRP protein sequences.
This indicated that observed similarity between spike-surface proteins were not a reflection of
general phylogenetic similarity. Phylogenetic analyses using distance-based methods also led to
similar results (data not shown).

Discussion
Microbial pathogens display different degrees of likeness at the level of their macromolecules, as
well their biological behavior. This is generally a consequence of shared ancestry, horizontal gene
transfer or convergent evolution. When it comes to infectious diseases, these similarities might
bear epidemiological or clinical importance. This is especially so when a new pathogen appears,
whose evolution, pathogenesis and immunology is largely unknown. In this bioinformatic study,
we found a potentially important homology between SARS-CoV2 spike protein and paramyxoviral
surface proteins. This homology was far more significant than any other homologies between
SARS-CoV2 and ssRNA viruses (except for SARS-CoV2 nsp3 homology with Togaviruses).
Although this homology also existed for some other pathogenic betacoronavirus spike proteins,
the one observed for SARS-CoV2 demonstrated a much higher score-log E value. When analyzed
for the presence of experimentally verified epitopes (which are mostly derived from studies on
SARS-CoV proteins), a high number of B cell, T cell and MHC binding epitopes were observed
inside this Spike-Fusion homology region. Hence, it seemed that this observed homology was
likely more than a coincidental and biologically inert similarity.

Paramyxoviruses include several major human and animal pathogens, with well-recognized
pathophysiology and immune behavior (13-16). Measles and mumps viruses are known human
paramyxoviruses and canine distemper and Rinderpest viruses are animal pathogens. In our
analyses, a reptilian paramyxovirus followed by canine, rinderpest and measles morbiliviruses
revealed the highest degrees of homology with SARS-CoV2 spike protein. Among human
pathogens, lower levels of homology were seen with fusion proteins from henipaviruses and
respirovirus 1. The observed Spike-Fusion protein homology was not limited to SARS-CoV2.
Spike proteins from other betacoronaviruses (e.g. bat CoV BM48 and SARS-CoV) as well as some
alpha coronaviruses also showed some levels of homology. However, when compared in terms of
expect value, SARS-CoV2 spike-fusion homology was orders of magnitude stronger that other
pathogenic human coronaviruses, i.e. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Evolution from a common ancestor is usually the underlying reason for the existence of
homologies between nucleic acid and/or protein sequences. Indeed, the concept of “sequence
homology” entails “shared ancestry” and sequence similarities between taxa which do not share a
recent common ancestor are referred to as ‘homoplasy’ (17, 18). Phylogenetic relations of RNA
viruses is usually inferred based on analyses of well conserved proteins including RNA
polymerases. RdRP-based phylogenetic analysis of representative members of ssRNA viruses
showed that the observed Spike-Fusion protein similarity does not seem to follow the branching
pattern of inferred phylogenetic tree. While various RNA viruses ought to share a common
ancestor at some level of evolution, our current analysis suggests that factors other than shared
ancestry might be at work. Presumably, there might be a degree of convergent evolution between
SARS-CoV2 spike and paramyxovirus fusion proteins, which might be driven by selection
pressure from host-pathogen interactions. Regardless of the underlying evolutionary mechanism,

similar viral protein sequences might bear immunological importance, especially if they are
observed in proteins which can be readily targeted by adaptive immune responses. Studies on
previous coronaviruses have shown that spike protein is a target for humoral as well as cellular
immune responses (19-21). When analyzed for the presence of experimentally verified B cell
and/or cell epitopes Spike-Fusion homology region showed a high concentration of these epitopes,
compared with the rest the protein sequence. As alluded to in the introduction, some recent reports
have suggested that vaccination using live MMR vaccine might offer a degree of protection against
COVID-19 infection. Consistent with our data, a pre-print study by Franklin et al has shown
protein sequence as well as 3D structure similarities between SARS-CoV2 spike and
measles/mumps virus fusion proteins (7). They have also reported epidemiological data indicating
that MMR vaccination is indeed associated with lower COVID-19 frequency in different countries
(7). It should be noted that, while antigenic similarities raise the possibility of cross-protective
adaptive immune responses, this does not exclude the possibility of involvement of innate immune
mechanisms, as shared pathogenic molecular structures might also lead to similar patterns of innate
immune activation.
Unraveling different aspects of the evolution of microbial pathogens is of paramount importance
in predicting, understanding and controlling infectious disease epidemics. Ordinary bioinformatic
analyses on nucleic acid and/or proteins might give us some hints about the relatedness or
dissimilarities between pathogenic microorganisms, but grasping the complexity of this dynamism
would likely require integrated analyses of host(s)-pathogen(s) co-evolution.
