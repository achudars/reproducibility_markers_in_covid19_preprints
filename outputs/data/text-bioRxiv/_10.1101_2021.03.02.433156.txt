Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 viruses are more transmissible, may lead to greater clinical
severity, and result in modest reductions in antibody neutralization. subgenomic RNA
(sgRNA) is produced by discontinuous transcription of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and is a
crucial step in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Applying our tool (periscope) to ARTIC Network
Oxford Nanopore genomic sequencing data from 4400 SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical
samples, we show that normalised sgRNA expression profiles are significantly increased in
B.1.1.7 infections (n=879). This increase is seen over the previous dominant circulating
lineage in the UK, B.1.177 (n=943), which is independent of genomic reads, E gene cycle
threshold and days since symptom onset at sampling. A noncanonical sgRNA which could
represent ORF9b is found in 98.4% of B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2 infections compared with only
13.8% of other lineages, with a 16-fold increase in median expression. We hypothesise that
this is a direct consequence of a triple nucleotide mutation in nucleocapsid
(28280:GAT>CAT, D3L) creating a transcription regulatory-like sequence complementary to
a region 3’ of the genomic leader. These findings provide a unique insight into the biology of
B.1.1.7 and support monitoring of sgRNA profiles in sequence data to evaluate emerging
potential variants of concern.

Main Text
The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 lineages B.1.1.7 (​20I/501Y.V1 or VOC-202012/01),
B.1.351 (​20H/501Y.V2 or VOC-202012/02​) and P.1 (​20J/501Y.V3 or VOC-202101/02)​ ​(​1​)
have been classified as variants of concern by public health agencies. An increasing body of
evidence suggests B.1.1.7 is more transmissible ​(​2​, ​3)​ ​ and rapidly became the dominant
circulating virus in the United Kingdom (UK) during October 2020 to February 2021 (Figure
1A). To date, B.1.1.7 has been reported in 93 countries (​https://cov-lineages.org/​, 22nd
February 2021), with increasing prevalence. Recent data suggest a similar pattern for P.1 in
Manaus ​(​4)​ ​, Brazil ​(​5​)​, and now 19 other countries (​https://cov-lineages.org/​, 22nd February
2021), where it appears to be more transmissible than it’s ancestral lineage B.1.1.28 ​(​4​)​.
Along with B.1.351, these variants of concern harbour functionally important mutations in the
SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, some of which demonstrate evidence of convergent evolution
across all three lineages (Supplementary Table S1). Preliminary data ​(​6,​ ​7)​ ​ shows that
B.1.1.7 positive diagnostic respiratory samples may have lower cycle threshold (Ct) values,
therefore higher viral loads, compared to other lineages. These findings suggest a potential
reason for enhanced transmissibility, though they did not account for potential confounders
such as days since symptom onset at sampling. Many of these studies also use S gene
target failure (SGTF) as a surrogate for the presence of B.1.1.7 ​(​6​)​, which might misclassify
samples, depending on the prevalence of B.1.1.7 ​(​8)​ ​. Several analyses from community
tested cases also suggest increased mortality associated with B.1.1.7 ​(​8)​ ​. Reasons for the
potential viral load increase and enhanced mortality are currently unclear ​(​9​)​.

Genomic surveillance has been critical in rapidly identifying these variants and Nanopore
sequencing of ARTIC Network ​(​10​)​ prepared SARS-CoV-2 amplicons is used by many
laboratories to generate this data. We have recently reported an approach to quantify
subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) expression profiles from genomic sequence data, which is
produced as a result of a critical step in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle ​(​11​)​. sgRNA is
produced from the genomically encoded SARS-CoV-2 RNA Dependent RNA polymerase
(RdRp) using discontinuous transcription of the positive, single-stranded SARS-CoV-2

genome from the 3’ end. Negatively stranded RNAs are produced, which are shorter than
the genome, owing to a template switch from the ORF to the leader sequence at the 5’ end
of the genome when RdRp encounters a transcription regulatory sequence in the genome
body (TRS-B) to a complementary TRS 3’ of the leader sequence (TRS-L). All sgRNAs
therefore contain a leader sequence at their 3’ end which can be used computationally for
their identification. There are thought to be nine such canonical sgRNAs; Spike:S, E:
Envelope, M: Membrane, N: Nucleocapsid, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8 and ORF10,
although multiple studies have found negligible ORF10 expression ​(​12​, ​13​)​.

As part of COVID-19 Genomics Consortium UK (COG-UK) ​(​14​)​ we are sequencing
SARS-CoV-2 positive nose-throat swabs from healthcare workers and patients at Sheffield
Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield, UK (‘Pillar 1’ testing). Additionally, to
relieve pressure on centralised sequencing services, we also sequence a selection from
‘Pillar 2’ testing, which represent SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from the community, tested
at the UK’s Lighthouse Laboratories (Figure S1). We hypothesised that we would see
differences in sgRNA expression profiles in distinct lineages of SARS-CoV-2, in particular,
increased sgRNA in B.1.1.7 that may relate to its altered phenotype.

We stratified sgRNA expression by lineage in 4400 SARS-CoV-2 sequences that reached
our previously defined quality control thresholds (>90% genome coverage, >50K mapped
reads, Table S2), normalized for the genomic coverage from the corresponding amplicon for
the five most abundantly expressed open reading frames (S, E, M, N and ORF6). We
focused our analyses primarily on comparing B.1.1.7 with B.1.177, the dominant lineage in
the UK, which was displaced by B.1.1.7. These two lineages are also the most represented
sequences from both sampling pillars in our dataset (Figure 1A&B, B.1.1.7; Pillar 1: 729,
Pillar 2: 150, B.1.177; Pillar 1: 764 Pillar 2: 179). A significant increase in normalized sgRNA
expression of S, N, and to a lesser extent E, ORF6 and M, was apparent in B.1.1.7
SARS-CoV-2 infections (Figure 1C&D, Wilcoxon effect sizes; S: 0.475, E: 0.191, M 0.0700,
N: 0.469, ORF6: 0.105). Negligible differences were seen in other ORF sgRNA (Figure S2).
Consistent with previous findings ​(​6​, ​15​),​ we also found significantly decreased E gene Ct

(Figure 1E&F). Accordingly, total mapped reads and total genomic RNA reads (i.e.
non-sgRNA) were also significantly higher for B.1.1.7 sequences compared to B.1.177
(Figure S3).

We observed a weak but significant negative correlation between raw sgRNA reads and
ECT (R = -0.16 and p=0.026 for B.1.177, R = -0.17 and p=0.042 for B.1.1.7), with a greater
negative correlation between genomic reads and ECT (R = -0.4 and p<0.0001 for B.1.177, R
= -0.42 and p<0.0001 for B.1.1.7; Fig 1G&H). To ensure the observed sgRNA expression
increase in B.1.1.7 was not due to the effect of ECT alone (as a surrogate of viral load), we
normalized sgRNA to ECT and repeated our comparisons. The differences between B.1.1.7
and B.1.177 were still apparent for S, N and M sgRNA (Figure 1I), suggesting that the
increase in B.1.1.7 sgRNA expression is seen independently of any difference in ECT
between lineages. To ensure the changes observed were not due to parental lineage
changes in sgRNA expression such as those observed with the R203K/G204R mutation ​(​17)​
we analysed normalized sgRNA comparing B.1.1.7 and B.1.177 with their respective
ancestral lineages (Figure 2A&B). An increase in sgRNA is still observed for B.1.1.7
compared to B.1.1 in all major ORFs and interestingly, for B.1.177 compared to B.1 for
ORFs S, E, M and N (Figure 2A&B). This demonstrates the importance of stratifying
sequences by lineage when studying sgRNA.

It is possible that the days since symptom onset at sampling may vary between lineages in
our dataset, either due to changes in sampling practice over time or presentation of
individuals to healthcare services, which in turn could confound our sgRNA findings. We
obtained information on symptom duration at sampling for 2327 samples in our pillar 1
genome sequenced cohort. A modest difference in the distribution of the days since
symptom onset between B.1.177 and B.1.1.7 was apparent, where B.1.1.7 infections
appeared to be sampled earlier (Figure 2C). We therefore applied a generalized linear
regression model to adjust for any effect this change in distribution might have on sgRNA
expression levels in lineages B.1, B.1.1, B.1.177 and B.1.1.7. Subgenomic RNA was still
significantly elevated in B.1.1.7 in S, N and M and to a lesser extent in E (Figure 2D, Fig S4,
Tables S3&S4). A smaller increase in sgRNA in B.1.177 (compared to B.1) was still seen,
though only for M and N. Furthermore, as sampling practice and sequencing in healthcare
workers in our hospital remained consistent throughout the period when B.1.177 and B.1.1.7
were circulating, we hypothesized that these data were less likely to be affected by unknown
confounders in sampling. Subgenomic RNA levels remained significantly higher in B.1.1.7
compared to B.1.177 infections when the comparison was restricted to samples from
healthcare workers (Figure S5). No difference in sgRNA levels for B.1.1.7 was seen by sex
or age (Figure S6 and S7). Relative light units in the diagnostic assay also varied over time
in B.1.1.7 compared to B.1.177 infections, with significantly higher RLU at 0, 1, 2, 3 days
since symptom onset (Figure 2E). Data since symptom onset for samples with Ct values
were insufficient to replicate this analysis.

From these cross-sectional data we created a pseudo infection time course using
normalized sgRNA expression at each day following symptom onset between B.1.1.7 and
B.1.177 infections. Significantly higher sgRNA for B.1.1.7 compared to B.1.177 was
observed early in infection for S and N sgRNA, with lower magnitude differences for E
sgRNA (Figure 2F&S8). This increase appeared to be greatest on day one following
symptom onset. Using the same methods for sgRNA estimation, we have previously shown
that ​ACE2 ​and ​TMPRSS2 ​expression alter the kinetics of sgRNA expression ​in vitro,​ leading
to a peak in expression at an earlier stage of infection ​(​11)​ ​. It is possible that the increased

models would be extremely valuable.

Noncanonical sgRNA are the result of RdRp template switching from regions of the genome
with no canonical TRS-B site. These noncanonical sgRNA tend to be enriched around
canonical sites, presumably due to the frequency of RdRp template switching that occurs in
close proximity. We quantified the expression of these noncanonical sgRNA in pillar 1
B.1.1.7 infections. We observed low levels of these transcripts throughout the genome
across all samples ​(​11)​ ​ and compared the presence of noncanonical sgRNA transcripts
between B.1.1.7 and B.1.177 infections (Figure 3A). In addition to the noncanonical sgRNA
resulting from the nucleocapsid R203K/G204R mutation (N*, Figure S2) ​(​17)​ ​, B.1.1.7
samples were also significantly enriched for reads which support the production of a
noncanonical sgRNA from genomic position 28282 (Figure 3B,C&D, Fig S9, Wilcoxon
unpaired p = <2e-16, Wilcoxon effect size = 0.797, B.1.1.7​n​=717, other​n​=430). The B.1.1.7
genomic sequence contains a triple nucleotide mutation at 28280, 28281, and 28282

GAT>CTA, resulting in an amino acid substitution, D3L, in the nucleocapsid protein. This
triplet results in enhanced complementarity between the 28282 genomic region and the
sequence 3’ of the leader at the 5’ end of the genome (Figure 3E), which may have resulted
in a novel TRS-B-like site that drives higher sgRNA production from this locus. Of note, this
site is upstream of the ORF9b ATG and this noncanonical sgRNA retains the full coding
region of the ORF9b, but lacks the canonical start codon of N. We propose that this
represents the ORF9b sgRNA, which was detected at low levels in 13.8% (430/3127)
non-B.1.1.7 samples (median normalised expression=0.32), but is found in almost all pillar 1
B.1.1.7 infections (98.4%, 717/729), with a 16-fold increase in expression (median
normalised expression=6.02 , Figure 3A&C).

Interestingly, we noticed non-B.1.1.7 samples in our dataset with low levels of putative
ORF9b sgRNA did not contain the nucleocapsid D3L mutation. We propose the following
hypothesis to explain our findings: in non-B.1.1.7 SARS-CoV-2, the weak complementarity
around the ORF9b ATG causes low levels of noncanonical sgRNA to be produced which
has high complementarity to the genome, but crucially contains the CTA triplet (Figure S9A).
This could have led to a transcriptionally driven recombination event resulting in the GAT >
CTA mutation in the genomic sequence (Figure 3E panel 2&3). This new TRS-B-like site
with increased complementarity in B.1.1.7 viruses, drives higher sgRNA production from this
locus, akin to sites of canonical sgRNA production (Figure 3E Panel 4). A similar event has
been described previously more 3’ in the N ORF ​(​17​)​, and mutations which result in
increased complementarity and noncanonical sgRNA formation have been shown to occur in
coronaviruses ​(​20)​ ​. This raises the possibility that an ORF9b protein could be produced
independently of other upstream sgRNAs with greater efficiency in B.1.1.7. ORF9b has been
shown to regulate interferon responses ​(​21​–​23​)​ and has been shown to be present in
SARS-CoV ​(​24)​ ​ and SARS-CoV-2 infections ​(​13,​ ​24​, ​25)​ ​. This finding could therefore be
important for investigating the greater transmissibility of B.1.1.7 and requires urgent
experimental validation. We explored whether the nucleocapsid D3L mutation has occurred
in non-B.1.1.7 lineages in the global COG-UK sequence data set (14th of February 2021).
77 sequences with D3L were noted in a variety of SARS-CoV-2 lineages and appear as

sequencing data can be used in real time to examine the effect of SARS-CoV-2 variation on
its ability to express its genome. We cannot say if the increased sgRNA expression is the
cause or consequence of an increase in viral replication or a more efficacious entry, but our
study provides further insight to guide exploration with mechanistic studies. A major
advantage of this approach is that we can deconvolute the contribution of genomic and
subgenomic RNA, which is impossible with current diagnostic PCR assays and we can,
additionally, examine all ORFs simultaneously and discover noncanonical subgenomic RNA
which could be of biological relevance. Finally we believe that sgRNA expression analysis
should be carried out on all compatible genomic surveillance platforms to give an instant
readout of altered expression profiles in emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. This would use
existing data to complement epidemiological and phylodynamic methods, and provide an
early warning of variants that might be of concern with regards to greater transmissibility
and/or disease severity.

Methods
Diagnostic SARS-CoV-2 Testing
SARS-CoV-2 positivity was determined from nose/throat swabs diagnostically by Sheffield
Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation trust either using the Hologic Panther to generate
Relative Light Units (RLU) ​(​26​)​ or an in house dual E/RdRp real time PCR assay to generate
a cycle threshold (ECT or RCT respectively) ​(​16​)​.

Sample Preparation, ARTIC Network PCR and Nanopore
Sequencing
RNA was extracted from viral transport medium (VTM) with Qiagen QIAamp MinElute Virus
Spin Kit (50). Resultant RNA was subject to the ARTIC network ​(​10​)​ tiled amplicon protocol
and subsequently sequenced on an Oxford Nanopore GridION X5. Bases were called with
the default basecaller in MinKNOW (currently guppy v4) with​ --require-both-ends​ set for
de-multiplexing. Raw sequencing fastq files were subject to no processing after sequencing
to ensure sgRNA leader sequences are retained as described previously ​(​11)​ ​.

Subgenomic Read Classification and Normalisation
Subgenomic RNAs were classified using periscope ​(​11​)​ as described previously. Briefly,
reads containing the leader sequence at their start are identified by a local alignment, the
quality of this alignment determines which quality “bin” sgRNA reads are placed (HQ, LQ or
LLQ). The amplicon from which the sgRNA evidence was generated is determined and a
count of genomic reads for this amplicon used to normalise the raw sgRNA read counts.
Samples were excluded from the subsequent analysis if:
●

Their consensus coverage was < 0.9

●

They had less than 50,000 mapped reads (we have previously shown that fewer
reads produce a less robust analysis)

Lineage Assignment
Lineages ​(​1)​ ​ were assigned using Pangolin (​https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin
v2.1.7).

Figure Generation, Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed in R ​(​27​)​. Figures were generated in R using tidyverse
(​28​)​, apart from those that depict sequencing reads, which were generated in IGV ​(​29)​ ​.
Tests between groups were performed using an unpaired Wilcoxon test using the rstatix
package (https://github.com/kassambara/rstatix) , adjusting p-values for any multiple
comparisons using the Holm method.

Phylogenetic Tree Generation
The grapevine pipeline (​https://github.com/COG-UK/grapevine​) was used for generating
the phylogeny based on all data available on GISAID and COG-UK up until 16th
February 2021. A representative sample of global sequences was obtained in 2 steps.
First by randomly selecting one sequence per country per epi week followed by random
sampling of the remaining sequences to generate a sample of 4000 sequences. The
global tree was then pruned using code adapted from the tree-manip package
(​https://github.com/josephhughes/tree-manip​). We then identified samples with D3L
mutations and colour coded these tips according to their lineages. The visualisation was
produced using R/ape, R/ggplot2, R/ggtree, R/treeio, R/phangorn, R/stringr, R/dplyr,
R/aplot.

Ethics Approval and Consent
Individuals presenting with active COVID-19 disease were sampled for SARS CoV-2
sequencing at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK using samples
