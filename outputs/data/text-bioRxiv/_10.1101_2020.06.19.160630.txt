Abstract
The rooting of the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny is important for understanding the origin and early spread
of the virus. Previously published phylogenies have used different rootings that do not always provide
consistent results. We investigate several different strategies for rooting the SARS-CoV-2 tree and provide
measures of statistical uncertainty for all methods. We show that methods based on the molecular clock
tend to place the root in the B clade, while methods based on outgroup rooting tend to place the root in
the A clade. The results from the two approaches are statistically incompatible, possibly as a consequence

provide strong statistical support for the placement of the root in any particular edge of the tree. Our
results suggest that inferences on the origin and early spread of SARS-CoV-2 based on rooted trees
should be interpreted with caution.

FIG. 1. Estimated maximum likelihood (A) and estimated maximum clade credibility using tip-dating (B) of the SARSCoV-2 phylogeny. Tips are colored according to their pangolin lineage assignment. The maximum likelihood estimate of the
phylogeny was obtained using the program RAxML-NG (Kozlov et al., 2019) under the GTR+Γ model of DNA substitution.
We estimated the maximum clade credibility tree using a time-measured Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction implemented
in BEAST (Suchard et al., 2018) v1.10.4. We used a GTR+Γ substitution model and the uncorrelated relaxed clock with
a lognormal distribution, and specified flexible skygrid coalescent tree priors. TreeAnnotator was used to annotate the
maximum clade credibility tree.
