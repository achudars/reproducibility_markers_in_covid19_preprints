Abstract

25

SARS-CoV-2 infection causes cytokine storm and overshoot immunity in humans; however, it

26

remains to be determined whether genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 and/or virus induced soluble

27

mediators from lung epithelial cells as natural host are carried out by macrophages or other

28

vehicles at distant organs causing tissue damage. We speculated that exosomes as extracellular

29

vesicles are secreted from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells may transport messages to other cells of

30

distant organs leading to pathogenic consequences. For this, we took an unbiased proteomic

31

approach for analyses of exosomes isolated from plasma of healthy volunteers and SARS-CoV-2

32

infected patients. Our results revealed that tenascin-C (TNC) and fibrinogen-β (FGB) are highly

33

abundant in exosomes from SARS-CoV-2 infected patient’s plasma as compared to that of

34

healthy normal controls. Since TNC and FGB stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokines via NF-B

35

pathway, we examined the status of TNF-L- and CCL5 expression upon exposure of

36

hepatocytes to exosomes from COVID-19 patients and observed significant increase when

37

compared with that from healthy subjects. Together, our results demonstrated that soluble

38

mediators, like TNC and FGB, are transported through plasma exosomes in SARS-CoV-2

39

infected patients and trigger pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in cells of distant organs in

40

COVID-19 patients.

41
42

Importance

43

Exosomes play an important role in intercellular communication by inducing physiological

44

changes in recipient cells by transferring bioactive proteins. Little is known about exosomes

45

from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and their role in pathogenesis. Here, we have carefully

46

examined and analyzed this aspect of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results uncovered the

47

potential mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 communicates with other cells of distant organs

and promotes pathogenesis. We expect to detect whether other factors are modulated in the

49

presence of COVID-19 exosomes. Our exosomes related proteomic experiments prioritize after

50

initial verification to further examine their role in SARS-CoV-2 associated other pathogenic

51

mechanisms to target for therapeutic modalities.

Introduction

54

Emergence of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has

55

precipitated the current global health crisis with many deaths worldwide. The World Health

56

Organization announced COVID-19 to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern

57

and declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus containing a 29.9 kb

58

positive-sense RNA genome. The virus genome contains at least ten open reading frames

59

(ORFs). The first ORF (ORF1a/b), representing about two-thirds of the viral RNA, are translated

60

into two large polyproteins, which are processed into 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-nsp16),

61

and some of them form the viral replicase transcriptase complex (1). The other ORFs of SARS-

62

CoV-2 genome encode four main structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N),

63

membrane (M), and several accessory proteins of unknown functions.

64
65

The lung is a vital organ which supports blood oxygenation and decarboxylation necessary for

66

aerobic life. Any insult including viral infection may impair this process and compromise

67

survival. Lung immune responses and inflammatory processes are tightly regulated to maintain

68

respiratory function. The lungs are highly susceptible in developing innate immune responses to

69

viral infection, such as SARS-CoV-2. Although this viral envelop protein interacts with

70

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) present on many cell surfaces as a receptor, lung

71

epithelial cells are probably the most susceptible cells for SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication

72

causing human disease. Clinical observations indicate that severely ill COVID-19 patients

73

develop extra-pulmonary tissue/organ dysfunctions, although viremia is not common. The

74

presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood was reported in very low number of postmortem

75

samples (2) and these observations are debatable (3). The pathophysiology of extra-pulmonary

76

manifestations is not entirely clear but thought to occur in part to a dysregulated inflammatory

77

response characterized by inhibition of interferon signaling by the virus, T cell lymphodepletion,

78

and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6 and TNFα (4, 5). Extra-

79

pulmonary manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 associated disease have been documented in

80

numerous organ systems including but not limited to cardiac, neurologic, hemostatic, kidney, and

81

liver.

82
83

Exosomes (30–150 nm) are extracellular vesicles and play an important role in intercellular

84

communication by inducing physiological changes in recipient cells by transferring bioactive

85

lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins. Exosome vesicles are formed by the interior budding of

86

endosomal membranes to form large multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Exosomes play an important

87

role in cellular homeostasis and in the pathogenesis of major human diseases. Evidence

88

suggested that exosomes carry materials from one cell to other cells for initiation and

89

exaggeration of disease (6). Exosomes are also involved in viral spread, immune regulation, and

90

antiviral response during infection (7-9). Little is known about exosomes of SARS-CoV-2

91

infected patients and their role in pathogenesis. In this study, we have observed that exosomes

92

from plasma of COVID-19 patients harbor tenascin-C and fibrinogen-β to trigger inflammatory

93

signal in distant cells.

Results

98

Isolation and characterization of exosomes from COVID-19 patient plasma. Patient

99

information and samples used in this study are shown (Table 1). We have isolated exosomes from

100

plasma of 20 COVID-19 patients and 8 healthy volunteers (normal). The size and purity of exosomes

101

were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and observed spheres of heterogeneous size

102

(30-70 nm particles) (Figure 1, panel A). The presence of exosomal markers, CD63 and TSG101,

103

was verified from the exosome preparations by Western blot analysis as described previously (10, 11) and

104

the results from a representative blot is shown (Figure 1, panel B). Exosome depleted serum (Invitrogen)

105

was used a negative control and as expected, did not exhibit the presence or cross-reactivity for CD63 or

106

TSG101 proteins. N1 and N2 of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs were undetected in exosome preparation from

107

patients or healthy subject controls using a CDC recommended PCR kit.

108
109

Exosomes from plasma of COVID-19 patients harbor tenascin-C and fibrinogen-β. Little is

110

known about the proteome profile of the exosomes from COVID-19 patients. Using unbiased

111

proteomic approach, the mass spectrometry analysis identified 1,637 proteins. We shortlisted 163

112

proteins having more than five spectra counts and at least twofold changes as compared to

113

plasma exosomes from healthy volunteers (Figure 2, panels A and B). Tenascin-C (TNC) and

114

fibrinogen-β (FGB) were identified as the two significantly enriched molecules in exosomes

115

from COVID-19 patients relative to normal exosomes.

117

TNC is an immunomodulatory extracellular matrix glycoprotein that induces chronic

118

inflammation and fibrosis in organs, including lung, liver, and kidney, by interaction with toll-

119

like receptor 4 (TLR4) and integrin receptors (12). However, association of TNC in SARS-CoV-

120

2 infection was not known. On the other hand, FGB is one of the components of fibrinogen

121

complex cleaved by the protease thrombin into fibrin to form blood clot (13, 14). Increased

122

levels of blood fibrinogen and associated disorders, such as coagulopathy and venous

123

thromboembolism, are observed in COVID-19 patients (15). Enhanced expression of TNC and

124

FGB in exosomes isolated from COVID-19 patients was verified by Western blot analysis

125

(Figure 3, panels A and B). However, the expression of these proteins in exosomes from normal

126

plasma was significantly low. Acute inflammation is characterized by increased production of

127

cytokines and the primary feature of COVID-19 is known to cause severe lung injury, and multi-

128

organ failure (12, 16, 17). The FGB and TNC induce pro-inflammatory cytokine production

129

through interaction with the inflammatory NF-kB signaling pathway and is supported by String

130

analysis (Figure 3, panel C). These results suggested COVID-19 patient plasma exosomes

131

harbor TNC and FGB and transport to distant organs for virus associated pathogenesis.

132
133

Exosomes isolated from COVID-19 plasma trigger pro-inflammatory cytokines in

134

hepatocytes through activation of NF-kB signaling.

135

hepatocytes in vitro were used as a model cell line and exposed to exosomes from COVID-19

136

patients or from healthy controls. A significant upregulation of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α),

137

interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) were observed from exposure of

138

immortalized human hepatocytes (IHH) to exosomes isolated from COVID19 patient plasma, as

139

compared to exosomes from healthy normal plasma (Figure 4, panel A). Similar results were

To investigate the association,

140

noted from COVID-19 plasma exosomes when exposed to a different cell line with hepatocyte

141

origin (Huh7). Pearson correlation analysis among expressions of the TNF-α, IL-6 and CCL5 in

142

the hepatocytes exposed with patient exosomes. A significant positive correlation (P= 0.001, r=

143

0.66) was seen between TNF-α and CCL5 expression from hepatocytes (Figure 4, panel B).

144

These results demonstrated that COVID-19 plasma exosomes trigger strong pro-inflammatory

145

cytokine production in hepatocytes.

146
147

NF-κB is a key player that regulates inflammation, innate and adaptive immunity, proliferation,

148

and cell survival (18). We observed a significant increase in phospho-NF-κB upon exposure of

149

hepatocytes (IHH or Huh7) to exosome from COVID-19 patients as compared to that from

150

normal plasma (Figure 4, panels C and D). The results further demonstrated that exosomes

151

from COVID-19 plasma, enriched with TNC and FGB, generate cytokine production by

152

activation of NF-κB signaling in hepatocytes.

153
154

Discussion

155

The novelty of observations from this study reveals: (i) an elevated level of TNC and FGB in

156

exosomes from plasma of COVID-19 patients, and (ii) COVID-19 exosomes enhance expression

157

of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-, IL-6, and chemokine CCL5 through the NF-B signaling

158

pathway upon exposure to hepatocytes, as a model for cells from distant organ. Our results

159

explain a different trans-regulatory mechanism for multiorgan pathogenic disorders during

160

SARS-CoV-2 infection.

162

An array of clinical studies in the literature demonstrated that COVID-19 patients experience a

163

cytokine storm (17, 19), although specific consequences and related mechanisms are not well

164

defined. There are conflicting reports on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in patient blood, but

165

we failed to detect viral RNA in the exosomes, and a similar observation was reported recently

166

(3, 20). Hijacking the exosomal pathway by several RNA viruses has been demonstrated to

167

mediate endogenous intercellular communication, immune modulation, and pathogenesis (6, 9,

168

21). We and others have shown that exosomes from HCV infected hepatocytes carry messages

169

for activation of hepatic stellate cells and induces fibrosis marker expression (11, 22). GM3-

170

enriched exosomes in COVID-19 patients are reported using lipidomics (23), although the

171

functional consequence is yet to be determined.

172
173

We focused at this point on the inflammatory molecules since they play a major role in COVID-

174

19 related pathogenesis. The association of TNC with SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been

175

previously reported. TNC induces chronic inflammation and fibrosis via an interaction with toll-

176

like receptor 4 and integrin receptors. Elevated expression of TNC in exosomes is reported in

177

glioblastoma patients and in nasal lavage fluid during human rhinoviruses infection (12, 24). On

178

the other hand, increased level of blood fibrinogen and venous thromboembolism are reported in

179

COVID-19 patients (15). In addition, FGB is involved in other disease processes, such as wound

180

healing, liver injury, allergic airways disease, cardiovascular disease and microbial pathogenesis

181

by modulating host immune system. FGB is primarily synthesized in hepatocytes, although

182

extrahepatic epithelial cells also synthesize fibrinogen (25). Elevated FGB expression was

183

reported in lung adenocarcinoma and suggested a potential role as biomarker (26). Elevated

184

fibrinogen is detected in exosomes from drug and alcohol induced liver injury, neurological

185

disorder, and swine flu viral infection (14, 27-30).

186
187

Chronic inflammation and increased cytokine production, like TNF-α, IL-6 and CCL5, are

188

critical features of COVID-19 patients which may suggest causing severe lung injury, multi-

189

organ failure, and poor prognosis (16, 17, 31-33). We observed activation of NF-KB signaling

190

and activation of target genes, TNF-α, IL-6 and CCL5, following exposure of hepatocytes to

191

exosomes isolated from plasma of COVID-19 patients (Figure 5). In SARS-CoV2 infection,

192

increased level of IL-6 and STAT3 are reported (31, 34). The spike protein of SARS-CoV2

193

triggers IL-6 production (5) and analyzing SARS-CoV-2 genetic materials in exosomes may be

194

important in understanding whether viral genetic materials play a role in cytokine induction in

195

distant organs. Other molecules present in exosomes from plasma of COVID-19 patients may

196

also have role in disease processes and need to be evaluated in future studies. Several studies

197

have suggested that non-coding RNAs carried through the exosomes play a crucial role in virus

198

mediated disease progression and warrant investigation. The presence of TNC and FGB in

199

SARS-CoV-2 infected patient exosomes may be a mechanism for cytokine storm resulting in

200

micro-thrombosis in some patients. Exosomes used in this study were isolated from patients

201

admitted to ICU in our academic medical center. Analyzing exosomes from SARS-CoV-2

202

infected patients with mild symptoms in future will help in understanding whether TNC and/or

203

FGB can be used as the potential prognostic markers. Further, how TNC and FGB are enhanced

204

COVID-19 patient will be important to understand. In conclusion, our results suggested that

205

exosomes carry TNC and FGB in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and exposure of cells from

206

distant organs may trigger cytokine expression. Our work also highlighted that TNC and FGB-

Materials and Methods

211

Plasma specimens

212

A total of 20 deidentified, heparinized-plasma specimens collected from COVID-19 patients

213

admitted at the Saint Louis University Hospital, were used. All patients were confirmed positive

214

for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR performed on a nasopharyngeal swab around the time of hospital

215

admission. Patient specimens were collected for clinical laboratory analyses as part of routine

216

clinical care. Patient information is summarized in Table 1. This study was waived by the Saint

217

Louis University Institutional Review Board for use of de-identified clinical specimens.

218

Archived plasma samples from 8 healthy volunteers were included as normal control and were

219

collected from pre-COVID-19 era for a different study.

220
221

Exosome isolation and analysis

222

Exosomes were isolated from plasma using the ME Kit (ME-020p-Kit) following the supplier’s

223

instruction (New England Peptide Inc, MA). The exosomes were examined after negative

224

staining using a JEOL JEM-1400Plus Transmission Electron Microscope.

225
226

Cell culture and exposure with exosomes

227

Immortalized human hepatocytes (IHH) and a human hepatoma cell line (Huh7) were maintained

228

in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum

229

(FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. IHH and Huh7 cells

230

were seeded into 6-well plate at a density of 3x105 cells/well and exposed to equal concentration

231

of exosomes for 48h. Cells were harvested for RNA analyses.

232
233

Mass spectrometry analysis

234

The exosome pellet was dissolved in lysis buffer (4% SDS, 100 mM DTT, 150 mM Tris–HCl pH

235

8.0) was subjected to Mass Spectrometric analysis using a Thermo Q-Exactive system. Peptides

236

were separated on an EASYnLC system with a Thermo ES803 PepMap C18 column. The results

237

were acquired in data dependent acquisition mode; top10 m/z for MS2 per cycle (Washington

238

University Proteomics Shared Resource). Candidate proteins were defined as those have

239

minimum 5 spectrum count and at least 2-fold enrichment compared to normal.

240
241

RNA isolation and analysis

242

Total RNA was isolated from exosomes or hepatocytes (IHH or Huh7) for qRT-PCR as

243

described previously (11), using TaqMan Universal PCR master mix and 6-carboxyfluorescein

244

(FAM)-MGB probes for SARS-CoV-2 [2019-nCoV CDC EUA kit (10006770, IDT)],

245

CCL5(assay ID: HS009822282_m1), IL-6 (assay ID: HS00985639_m1) and TNF-α: (assay ID:

246

HS00174128_m1) following manufacture’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 18s (assay ID:

247

Hs03928985_g1) was used as endogenous control. The relative gene expression was analyzed by

248

using the 2-∆∆CT formula (ΔΔCT = ΔCT of the sample − ΔCT of the control). Each sample was

249

loaded in triplicate for analysis.

Statistical Analysis

262

The results were expressed as mean ± standard error. Student's t test was used for comparison

263

between two groups (normal vs. COVID-19 exosomes). Pearson’s correlation analysis was

264

performed using GraphPad Prism software. P-values of <0.05 were considered statistically

265

significant. All experiments were repeated at least three times, and representative data are shown.
