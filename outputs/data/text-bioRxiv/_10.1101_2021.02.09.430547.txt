ABSTRACT

28

SARS-CoV-2 uses the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor for cell attachment and entry, with mouse ACE2

29

(mACE2) unable to support infection. Herein we describe an ACE2-lentivirus system and illustrate its

30

utility for in vitro and in vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection models. Transduction of non-permissive cell lines

31

with hACE2 imparted replication competence, and transduction with mACE2 containing N30D, N31K,

32

F83Y and H353K substitutions, to match hACE2, rescued SARS-CoV-2 replication. Intranasal hACE2-

33

lentivirus transduction of C57BL/6J mice permitted significant virus replication in lungs. RNA-Seq

34

analyses illustrated that the model involves an acute inflammatory disease followed by resolution and

35

tissue repair, with a transcriptomic profile similar to that seen in COVID-19 patients. Intranasal hACE2-

36

lentivirus transduction of IFNAR-/- and IL-28RA-/- mice lungs was used to illustrate that loss of type I or

37

III interferon responses have no significant effect on virus replication. However, their importance in

38

driving inflammatory responses was illustrated by RNA-Seq analyses. We also demonstrate the utility of

39

the hACE2-lentivirus transduction system for vaccine evaluation in C57BL/6J mice. The ACE2-

40

lentivirus system thus has broad application in SARS-CoV-2 research, providing a tool for both

41

mutagenesis studies and mouse model development.

AUTHOR SUMMARY

44

SARS-CoV-2 uses the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor to infect cells, but cannot infect mice because the

45

virus cannot bind mouse ACE2 (mACE2). We use an ACE2-lentivirus system in vitro to identify four

46

key amino acids in mACE2 that explain why SARS-CoV-2 cannot infect mice. hACE2-lentivirus was

47

used to express hACE2 in mouse lungs in vivo, with the inflammatory responses after SARS-CoV-2

48

infection similar to those seen in human COVID-19. Genetically modified mice were used to show that

49

type I and III interferon signaling is required for the inflammatory responses. We also show that the

50

hACE2-lentivirus mouse model can be used to test vaccines. Overall this paper demonstrates that our

51

hACE2-lentivirus system has multiple applications in SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 research.

INTRODUCTION

54

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly into a global

55

pandemic (1). SARS-CoV-2 infection can be asymptomatic, but is also the etiological agent of

56

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) representing a

57

common severe disease manifestation (2). The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has sparked unprecedented global

58

research into understanding mechanisms of virus replication and disease pathogenesis, with the aim of

59

generating new vaccines and treatments. Key to these efforts has been the development of animal models

60

of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease (3).

61

The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 binds human

62

Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the primary receptor for cell attachment and entry (4).

63

Mice do not support productive virus replication because the SARS-CoV-2 spike does not bind to mouse

64

ACE2 (mACE2) (5). Expression of hACE2 in mice via a transgene allows SARS-CoV-2 infection and

65

provides mouse models that recapitulate aspects of COVID-19. In such models hACE2 is expressed

66

under control of various promoters, including K18 (6-12), mACE2 (13, 14), HFH4 (15), or chicken β-

67

actin (16). These mouse models all differ in various aspects including level of virus replication, disease

68

manifestations and tissue tropisms (3), but do not provide a simple mechanism whereby genetically

69

modified (GM) or knock-out mice can be exploited for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 research. Two systems

70

that do allow the latter, involve transient hACE2 expression in mouse lungs using adenovirus vectors

71

(Ad5) or adeno-associated virus (AAV), which impart the capacity for productive SARS-CoV-2

72

replication in mouse lungs (10, 17, 18). A third model involves use of mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 (19-

73

21), although use of this mutated virus may complicate evaluation of interventions targeting human

74

SARS-CoV-2.

75

Lentivirus-mediated gene expression in mice lung epithelium has been investigated as a treatment

76

for cystic fibrosis and provides long term expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance

77

regulator (CFTR) (22-28). These studies demonstrated that VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus can transduce

78

mouse airway epithelial cells and their progenitors resulting in long-term gene expression. Herein we

79

describe an ACE2-lentiviral system that conveys SARS-CoV-2 replication competence in vitro and allows

80

productive infection of mouse lungs in vivo. We illustrate that GM mice can thereby be accessed for

81

SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 research, with experiments using IFNAR-/- and IL-28RA-/- mice showing the

82

importance of type I and III IFN responses for SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammation. We also illustrate

83

the use of hACE2-lentiviral transduction of lungs of wild-type C57BL/6J mice for evaluation of vaccines.

RESULTS

86

hACE2-lentiviruses for evaluating the role of RBD binding residues

87

hACE2 coding sequence (optimized for mouse codon usage) was cloned into the dual promoter lentiviral

88

vector pCDH-EF1α-MCS-BGH-PGK-GFP-T2A-Puro (herein referred to as pCDH) (Figure 1A), which

89

had been modified to contain the full length EF1α promoter. Previous studies have shown that the EF1α

90

promoter effectively drives gene expression after intranasal VSV-G pseudotyped lentivirus transduction

91

of mouse lungs (29). The GFP marker and puromycin resistance gene (cleaved from GFP by T2A) are

92

expressed from a separate 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter (Figure 1A). VSV-G pseudotyped

93

pCDH-hACE2 lentivirus was produced by co-transfection of the lentiviral vector with VSV-G and Gag-

94

Pol-Rev plasmids in HEK293T cells, and was used to transduce HEK293T (human embryonic kidney)

95

cells followed by puromycin selection. HEK293T cells do not express hACE2 (30) and therefore do not

96

support SARS-CoV-2 replication, whereas HEK293T cells transduced with hACE2 supported significant

97

virus replication (Figure 1B). A T92Q mutation in hACE2 was introduced to determine if removing the

98

N90 glycosylation motif increased SARS-CoV-2 replication, as computer-based modelling predicted

99

enhanced affinity for spike RBD with removal of this glycan (31, 32). We also introduced K31N/K353H

100

and T27Y/L79Y/N330Y mutations into hACE2 as these changes were predicted by computer modeling to

101

reduce and enhance affinity for spike RBD (31), respectively. HEK293T cells expressing these

102

aforementioned hACE2 mutations did not significantly affect SARS-CoV-2 replication (Figure 1B),

103

illustrating that in silico affinity predictions do not always translate to differences in virus replication.

105

Characterizing residues responsible for the inability of mACE2 to support SARS-CoV-2 replication

106

The ACE2-lentivirus system was used to introduce amino acid substitutions into mACE2 to identify the

107

amino acids that are responsible for restricting SARS-CoV-2 replication in mACE2-expressing cells.

108

Analysis of crystal structures and species susceptibilities has suggested residues that may be responsible

109

for the differences in binding of the RBD to hACE2 and mACE2 (33-37). Based on these in silico

110

studies, we identified seven residues potentially responsible for the human-mouse differences. mACE2-

111

lentivirus vectors were then generated that contained all seven substitutions

112

(N30D/N31K/T79L/S82M/F83Y/A329E/H353K), with two further vectors constructed to identify the

113

minimum requirements for SARS-CoV-2 replication. The latter contained a subset of the seven changes;

114

four amino acid changes (N30D/N31K/F83Y/H353K) and two amino acid changes (N31K/H353K).

115

As expected HEK293T cells expressing mACE2 did not support productive SARS-CoV-2

116

replication, and CPE was not observed. In contrast, all three mACE2 mutants significantly rescued virus

117

replication and infection resulted in CPE (Figure 1C-D). However, virus replication was significantly

118

lower for cells expressing mACE2 with only two substitution (N31K/H353K) (Figure 1C) and infection

119

produced less CPE (Figure 1D). Thus two amino acid changes (N31K and H353K) in mACE2 were

120

sufficient to support SARS-CoV-2 replication; however, at least four changes

121

(N30D/N31K/F83Y/H353K) were required for virus replication and CPE to be comparable to cells

122

expressing hACE2. These studies highlight the utility of the ACE2-lentivirus system for studying the role

123

of ACE2 residues in productive SARS-CoV-2 infections.

124
125

Modeling the RBD:ACE2 key interactions for mouse, human and virus variants

126

Of all the potential interactions between the RBD and ACE2 previously identify by X ray

127

crystallography and of all the amino acid differences between human and mouse ACE2 (33, 37), our data

128

identified a key role for 4 ACE2 mutations for conferring SARS-CoV-2 infectivity on mACE2 expressing

129

cells. Modeling of the interactions between these 4 mutations and the RBD predict improved interactions

130

between the virus and the receptor (Figure 1E), providing an explanation for the gain of function for the

5

131

mutated mACE2. The F83Y substitution replaced a non-polar interaction between mACE2-F83 and

132

RBD-N487, with a polar interaction between hACE2-Y83 and RBD-N487. The N31K substitution

133

created new interactions between ACE2-K31 and RBD-Q493. The N30D substitution created a salt

134

bridge interaction between ACE2-D30 and RBD-K417. Lastly, the H353K substitution created a new

135

hydrogen bond with RBD-G496.

136

Recently, SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged with mutations in the RBD, with two of the key

137

mutations involving interactions with hACE2 residues 30 and 353 (38). Republic of South Africa (RSA)

138

variants (B.1.351 and 501Y.V2) have the RBD mutations K417N and N501Y, and the United Kingdom

139

(UK) variants (B.1.1.7 and 501Y.V1) have the N501Y mutation (38). Modelling predicts that the K417N

140

mutation would result in the gain of an interaction between RBD N417 and mACE2-Q34, whereas the

141

interaction between K417 and hACE2-D30 would be lost (Figure 1F). The selection for RBD-K417N in

142

humans may therefore be more related to antibody escape (39, 40), rather than improving interactions

143

with hACE2. The N501Y mutation in the RBD is predicted to generate new interactions between Y501

144

with mACE2-H353, and new polar interactions between Y501 and hACE2-K353 (Figure 1F). Our

145

modeling supports the observation that viruses with K417N and N501Y mutations have increased affinity

146

for mACE2, with both appearing in mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (41).

147
148

hACE2-lentivirus transduction of mouse cell lines imparts SARS-CoV-2 replication competence

149

To determine whether hACE2-lentivirus transduction could make mouse cell lines SARS-CoV-2

150

replication competent and thus available for SARS-CoV-2 research, 3T3 (mouse embryonic fibroblasts)

151

and AE17 (mouse lung mesothelioma cell line) cells were transduced with hACE2. Significant virus

152

replication was seen in transduced cells (Supplementary Figure 1), although somewhat lower than that

153

seen in transduced HEK293T cells. Overt CPE was not seen (Supplementary Figure 1). This illustrates

154

that the hACE2-lentivirus system can be used for mouse cell lines, but that the efficiency of viral

155

replication may be cell line or cell type dependent.

SARS-CoV-2 replication in hACE2-lentivirus transduced C57BL/6J, IFNAR-/- and IL-28RA-/- mice

158

lung

159

To illustrate the utility of the hACE2-lentivirus system for use in GM mice, we investigated the role of

160

type I and type III IFN receptor signaling in SARS-CoV-2 infections. C57BL/6J, IFNAR -/- and IL-28RA-

161

/-

162

approximately 190-350 ng of p24 per mice (Figure 2A). An hour prior to administration of lentivirus,

163

mice were treated i.n. with 1% lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to enhance transduction efficiency (25,

164

42). One week later mice were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 (105 CCID50 i.n. per mice), and lungs were

165

collected at 2, 4 and 6 days post infection for C57BL/6J and IFNAR-/- mice and day 2 for IL-28RA-/-

166

mice (Figure 2A). Mice did not display overt clinical symptoms or weight loss (Figure 2B), consistent

167

with some studies using Ad5-hACE2 (10), but not others (43). RT-qPCR analyses indicated similar levels

168

of hACE2 mRNA after transduction of mouse lungs in each of the 3 mouse strains, with expression

169

maintained over the 6 day course of the experiment at levels significantly higher than untransduced mice

170

(Figure 2C).

171

were inoculated intranasally (i.n.) with 1.2-2.2×104 transduction units of hACE2-lentivirus, equivalent to

Lungs from infected C57BL/6J, IFNAR-/- and IL-28RA-/- were analyzed for infectious virus tissue

172

titers. Untransduced lungs showed no detectable virus titers (Figure 2D), whereas hACE2-lentivirus

173

transduced lungs showed significant viral titers ranging from 102 to 105 CCID50/g for all strains of mice on

174

day 2, with titers dropping thereafter (Figure 2D). Viral RNA levels were measured using RT-qPCR, with

175

untransduced lungs showing low and progressively decaying levels post-inoculation (Figure 2E). For all

176

hACE2-lentivirus transduced lungs, significantly elevated and persistent viral RNA levels were seen for

177

all strains and at all time points by RT-qPCR (Figure 2E). Reducing viral titers and lingering viral RNA

178

have been reported previously for K18-hACE2 mice (9) and has also been suggested in human infections

179

(44). RNA-Seq also illustrated that virus replication in hACE2-lentivirus transduced lungs, K18-hACE2

180

transgenic mice and Ad5-hACE2 transduced lungs (43) were not significantly different when normalized

181

to hACE2 mRNA expression (Figure 2F), suggesting comparable hACE2 translation efficiencies and

182

SARS-CoV-2 replication efficiencies in these different expression systems.

183

Importantly, no significant differences in viral loads emerged between C57BL/6J, IFNAR-/- and

184

IL-28RA-/- mice (Figure 2D, E). This remained true even when viral RNA levels were normalized to

185

hACE2 mRNA levels (Supplementary Figure 2). Similar results were obtained by RNA-Seq, with viral

186

read counts not significantly different for the 3 mouse strains (Supplementary Figure 3A-D). Thus using

187

three different techniques, no significant effects on viral replication could be seen in mice with type I or

188

type III IFN receptor deficiencies.

190

SARS-CoV-2 replication in hACE2-lentivirus transduced mice lung induces inflammatory

191

signatures by day 2 post-infection

192

To determine the innate responses to SARS-CoV-2 replication in hACE2-transduced mouse lungs, gene

193

expression in lungs of infected hACE2-transduced mice was compared with infected untransduced mice

194

on day 2 post-infection using RNA-Seq. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between these groups

195

were identified using a false discovery rate (FDR, or q value) threshold of <0.05 (Figure 3A;

196

Supplementary Table 1A-C). Of the 110 DEGs, 95 were upregulated, with ≈40% of these classified as

197

type I IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) as classified by Interferome (using conservative settings that only

198

included genes validated in vivo for mice) (Figure 3B, full list in Supplementary Table 1D). Type III

199

ISGs are known to be poorly annotated in this database, and so this analysis likely under-estimates the

200

number of such ISGs.

201

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) of the 110 DEGs produced a series of pro-inflammatory

202

Upstream Regulators (USRs) (Supplementary Table 1E-F) and included Th1, Th2 and Th17-associated

203

cytokine USRs, as well as type I IFN USRs (Figure 3C). SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in humans were

204

reported to be predominantly Th1-associated, but Th2-associated cytokines were also identified (45). A

205

cytokine and type I IFN DEG list has been published for a RNA-Seq analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infected

206

K18-hACE2 transgenic mice (9). These DEG lists were used to interrogate the full pre-ranked (fold

207

change) gene list (Figure 3A, Supplementary Table 1B) by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).

208

Significant enrichments were observed (Figure 3D), indicating similar cytokine and type I interferon

209

(IFN) responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection of K18-hACE2 transgenic and hACE2-lentivirus transduced

210

mice.

211

IPA Diseases and Functions analysis of the 110 DEGs revealed a series of annotations dominated

212

by cellular infiltration and innate responses signatures (Figure 3E, Supplementary Table 1G-H). Several

213

of the annotations were associated with monocytes and macrophages (Figure 3E), consistent with a

214

previous report showing that inflammatory monocyte-macrophages were the major source of

215

inflammatory cytokines in mouse adapted SARS-CoV infected mice (46). The cellular infiltrates in

216

COVID-19 patient lungs is also dominated by monocyte-macrophages with a suggested role in severe

217

disease (47). Innate immune signaling was also the dominant signature in other analyses including GO

218

Biological Processes and Cytoscape (Supplementary Table 1I-J).

219

GSEA analysis using the >31,000 gene signatures available from the molecular signatures

220

database (MSigDB), indicated significant negative enrichment (negative NES scores) of gene sets

221

associated with translation and mitochondrial electron transport chain function (Supplementary Table

222

1K). Translation inhibition by SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1 via the blocking of mRNA access to ribosomes has

223

been reported previously (48, 49). SARS-CoV-2 down-regulation of genes associated with cellular

224

respiration and mitochondrial function has also been shown in human lung (50).

225

DEGs from human COVID-19 lung (51) were also enriched in our hACE2-lentivirus transduced

226

mouse lungs, and analysis of the core enriched genes indicated the similarity was due to cytokine, IFN,

227

chemokine and inflammatory signaling genes (Figure 3F, Supplementary Table 1L-M). Another human

228

COVID-19 lung dataset was also interrogated (52) and the results again illustrated enrichment of immune-

229

related DEGs in the hACE2-lentivirus transduced mice (Supplementary Table 1N).

230

Overall these analyses illustrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection in hACE2-lentivirus transduced

231

C57BL/6J mice lungs significantly recapitulate responses seen in other murine models and in COVID-19

232

patients.

235

Day 6 post-infection is characterized by inflammation resolution and tissue repair signatures

236

To determine how response profiles progress in the hACE2-lentivirus model, RNA-Seq was used to

237

compare lungs on day 2 with lungs on day 6 post-infection, with day 6 broadly representing the time of

238

severe lung disease in the K18-hACE2 model (9). As noted above (Figure 2D), the virus titers had

239

dropped in hACE2-lentivirus transduced mice lung over this time period by ≈2.8 logs, and severe disease

240

(typically measured by weight loss) was not evident in this hACE2-lentivirus model (Figure 2B). In both

241

hACE2-lentivirus transduced and untransduced C57BL/6J mice there was a clear evolution of responses

242

from day 2 to day 6 post-infection; however, DEGs obtained from the former were largely distinct from

243

DEGs obtained from the latter (Figure 4A). The RNA-Seq data thus illustrated that the DEGs associated

244

with virus infection were distinct from those associated with virus inoculation (Figure 4A). RNA-Seq of

245

infected lungs provided 551 DEGs, 401 up-regulated and 150 down-regulated (Figure 4B, Supplementary

246

Table 2A-C).

247

IPA USR analyses of the 551 DEGs showed a clear reduction in inflammatory cytokine

248

annotations, although the IL4 signature remained a dominant feature on day 6 (Figure 4C, Supplementary

249

Table 2D-E). A Th2 skew and IL-4 have both been associated with lung damage in COVID-19 patients

250

(53). On day 6 there was an up-regulation of USRs primarily associated with tissue repair (Figure 4D,

251

Supplementary Table 2F); MAPK1 (also known as ERK) and MAPK9 (54), BMP7 (55), TCF7L2 (56),

252

and KLF4 (57, 58). B and T cell-associated USRs were also seen (Figure 4D, green circles) (59-61),

253

consistent with development of an adaptive immune response. A relatively minor PARP1 signature was

254

identified (Figure 4D), with PARP inhibitors being considered for COVID-19 therapy (62, 63). A strong

255

signature associated with estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) was observed (Figure 4D), with estrogen having

256

anti-inflammatory properties and believed to be associated with reduced COVID-19 severity in women

257

(64-66), and reduced SARS-CoV disease severity in female mice (46, 67). Follicle stimulating hormone

258

(FSH) (Figure 4D) stimulates estrogen production, and inhibin subunit alpha (INHA) is involved in the

259

negative feedback of FSH production (68). IPA Diseases and Functions analysis, Cytoscape, and GO

260

Biological Processes analyses further supported the contention that on day 6 inflammation had abated and

261

tissue repair was underway (Supplementary Table 2G-L).

262

The >31,000 gene sets available in MSigDB were used to interrogate the complete gene list (pre-

263

ranked by fold change) for day 6 versus day 2 (Supplementary Table 2B) by GSEA. A highly significant

264

negative enrichment for inflammatory response, and a highly significant positive enrichment for cilium

265

development was seen (Figure 4E). Cilia in mammals are found in the lining of the respiratory

266

epithelium. These GSEAs thus provide further support for the conclusion above, together arguing that in

267

the hACE2-lentivirus model, day 6 post infection is characterized by inflammation resolution and tissue

268

repair.

269
270

Type I and III IFN signaling is required for SARS-CoV-2-induced lung inflammation

271

To determine what responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection are dependent on type I IFN signaling, the

272

lentivirus system was used to analyze IFNAR -/- mice lung using RNA-Seq. IFNAR-/- and C57BL/6J mice

273

were transduced with hACE2-lentivirus and were then infected with SARS-CoV-2 and lungs harvested

274

for RNA-Seq on days 2 and 6 post-infection. The largest impact of type I IFN signaling deficiency was

275

seen on day 2 post infection (Figure 5A), consistent with disease resolution on day 6 (Figure 4C-E). The

276

total number of DEGs for IFNAR-/- versus C57BL/6J mouse lungs on day 2 was 192, with most of these

277

down-regulated (Figure 5A, Supplementary Table 3A-C). Viral reads were not significantly different

278

between these two mouse strains (Figure 5A), confirming that knocking out type I IFN signaling is

279

insufficient to significantly affect SARS-CoV-2 replication (69).

280

We showed in Figure 3 that RNA-Seq analysis revealed 110 DEGs associated with inflammatory

281

responses when hACE2-transduced versus untransduced C57BL/6J mouse lungs on day 2 post infection

282

were compared. When the same comparison was made for hACE2-lentivirus transduced versus

283

untransduced lungs in SARS-CoV-2 infected IFNAR-/- mice, only 1 DEG (Kcnk5) was identified (Figure

284

5B). This clearly illustrated that the inflammatory responses on day 2 in C57BL/6J mice (Figure 3C)

285

required intact type I IFN signaling.

286

As a control, the number of DEGs for IFNAR-/- mice versus C57BL/6J in untransduced lungs was

287

determined. Although virus replication (hACE2-lentivirus transduced lung) provided 192 DEGs, virus

288

inoculation (untransduced lung) provided only 16 DEGs (Figure 5C). Thus again, virus inoculation had a

289

limited effect on these analyses, with DEGs largely associated with virus infection.

290

Type III IFN is thought to act as a first-line of defense against infection at epithelial barriers, with

291

the more potent and inflammatory type I IFN response kept in reserved in the event the first line of

292

defense is breached (70, 71). As type III IFN signaling has been implicated in reducing SARS-CoV-2

293

infection in vitro (72), the aforementioned analyses on day 2 was repeated in IL-28RA-/- mice. Viral reads

294

were not significantly different between these two mouse strains (Figure 5D), confirming that knocking

295

out type III IFN signaling was insufficient to significantly affect SARS-CoV-2 replication (69, 73). The

296

DEG list for IL-28RA-/- versus C57BL/6J mice comprised 132 genes (Supplementary Table 4A-C), of

297

which 84 were down-regulated (Figure 5D). Perhaps surprisingly, the DEGs were mostly different from

298

that seen in IFNAR-/- mice (Figure 5D), arguing that the ISGs stimulated by type I and III IFNs are largely

299

distinct.

300

The majority (90%) of the 178 down-regulated DEGs in IFNAR-/- versus C57BL/6J mice on day

301

2 post infection were ISGs as defined by Interferome (using in vivo and mouse only settings) (Figure 5E,

302

top and Supplementary Table 3D). Of the 84 down-regulated genes in IL-28RA-/- lungs, only 27% were

303

identified as ISGs (Figure 5E, bottom and Supplementary Table 4D). However, there are no annotations

304

in the Interferome database for type III ISGs in mice, and changing the settings to include human data

305

(which is also under-annotated for type III IFN) did not increase the number of type III ISGs in our search

306

using down DEGs from IL-28RA-/- lungs.

307

To determine the pathways regulated by type I and III IFN in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection,

308

IPA USR analyses was performed on DEG lists from day 2 for hACE2-lentivirus transduced lungs for

309

IFNAR-/- versus C57BL/6J (192 DEGs) and IL-28RA-/- versus C57BL/6J (132 DEGs). IPA USR

310

signatures associated with pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling were significantly reduced in both

311

IFNAR-/- and, to a lesser extent, IL-28RA-/- mice when compared to C57BL/6J mice (Figure 5F, full lists

312

in Supplementary Table 3E and 4E). The USR annotations for type I and III IFN receptor deficiencies

313

were largely similar (Figure 5F), although they arose from a largely distinct set of DEGs (Figure 5D).

314

This likely reflects expression of type I and type III IFN by different cell types with differing response

315

profiles to the same cytokines (70).

316

Taken together these results illustrate that while there was no significant effects on viral

317

replication, lungs from type I and type III IFN receptor knockout mice both had a significantly blunted

318

acute pro-inflammatory response following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The importance of type I IFN for

319

inflammation was reported previously using the AAV-hACE2 system (18).

320
321

Immunization with infectious or UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 protects against virus infection

322

To evaluate the utility of the hACE2-lentivirus mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 replication for vaccine

323

studies, C57BL/6J mice were immunized twice subcutaneously (s.c.) with either infectious SARS-CoV-2

324

or UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 (74) formulated with adjuvant (Figure 6A). Serum SARS-CoV-2

325

neutralization titers were determined post-boost, and revealed all mice had significant serum

326

neutralization titers (Figure 6B), comparable with the higher end levels seen in people with past SARS-

327

CoV-2 infections (75). On day 2 post challenge all mice were sacrificed. All mouse lungs had detectable

328

hACE2 mRNA by RT-qPCR, with levels higher in unvaccinated mice (Figure 6C), likely due to immune

329

cell infiltrates (see below) diluting hACE2 mRNA. Mice immunized with either infectious or UV-

330

inactivated SARS-CoV-2 showed significant reductions in viral RNA levels by RT-qPCR (Figure 6D) in

331

tissue titrations (Figure 6E) and by RNA-Seq read counts (Figure 6F). These immunizations thus

332

protected mice against significant viral infections and demonstrated the utility of hACE2-lentivirus

333

transduced mice as a model for vaccine evaluation.

334

Lungs harvested on day 2 were also analyzed by RNA-Seq (Supplementary Table 5A-B), with

335

1376 DEGs identified for infectious virus immunization versus unimmunized (DEGs in Supplementary

336

Table 5C). The DEGs were analyzed by IPA canonical pathways, USR analysis, and the Diseases and

337

Functions feature, which all showed infiltration signatures, dominated by T cell annotations

338

(Supplementary Table 5D-F). This was confirmed by GSEA of human blood transcription modules (76)

339

against the pre-ranked (by fold change) gene list for immunized versus unvaccinated mice

340

(Supplementary Table 5G). This showed the expected enrichment of T cell and B annotations in

341

immunized mice (Figure 6F), and illustrated that protection against virus replication in lungs of

342

immunized mice was associated with a significant infiltration of lymphocytes. This aligns with studies

343

that suggest COVID-19 patients that induce an early SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response have rapid

344

viral clearance and mild disease (77).

345
346

DISCUSSION

347

Herein we describe a hACE2-lentivirus transduction system that allows the use of C57BL/6J and GM

348

mice for SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 research. Virus titer in hACE2-lentivirus transduced mice lung were

349

comparable to other studies using mice transduced with Ad5 or AAV expressing hACE2 (10, 17, 18).

350

These transduction methodologies avoid the fulminant brain infection seen in K18-hACE2 mice, with

351

infection of this organ the major contributor to mortality in the K18-hACE2 model (78, 79). The key

352

advantage of lentiviral over adenoviral systems is the integration of the lentiviral payload into the host cell

353

genome, thereby providing long-term stable expression. The hACE2-lentivirus thus provides a new

354

option for studying SARS-CoV-2 infection that can be readily applied using standard lentivirus

355

technology. We characterize the lentivirus-hACE2 model of SARS-CoV-2 infection in C57BL/6J mice,

356

and illustrate the use of lentivirus-hACE2 to assess the role of type I and type III IFNs in virus control and

357

inflammatory responses using IFNAR-/- and IL-28RA-/- mice, respectively. We also illustrate the use of

358

C57BL/6J mice transduced with lentivirus-hACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine evaluation.

359

The lentivirus-hACE2 C57BL/6J mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection shares many cytokine

360

signatures with those seen in human COVID-19 patients; IL-2, IL-10, IL-6, TNFα, IL-4, IL-1β, IFNγ and

361

CSF3 signatures were found in SARS-CoV2-infected lentivirus-hACE2 transduced C57BL/6J mice on

362

day 2 post infection, and elevated levels of these cytokines are found in COVID-19 patients (80, 81).

363

Several of these cytokines have been implicated as mediators of COVID-19; for instance, IL-6 (82-84),

364

IL-4 (53), IL-10 (85) and IFNγ (86). On day 6 post infection the lentivirus-hACE2 C57BL/6J mouse

365

model showed a series of signatures associated with tissue repair. Thus our RNA-Seq analyses illustrated

366

that this model involves an acute inflammatory disease followed by resolution and tissue repair.

367

hACE2-lentivirus transduction in IFNAR-/- and IL-28RA-/- mice was used to confirm that type I

368

IFN signaling (18) and show that type III IFN signaling are involved in driving inflammatory responses.

369

Virus replication was not significantly affected in IFNAR-/- and IL-28RA-/- mice, largely consistent with

370

other studies using different model systems, which indicate that knocking out both pathways (STAT1-/-,

371

STAT2-/-, or combined IFNAR-/-/IL-28RA-/-) is required before an impact on virus replication is seen (18,

372

69, 73, 87). A high level of cross-compensation is thus implicated, as is described in influenza infection

373

(71). In vitro experiments show that SARS-CoV-2 replication is sensitive to type I and III IFNs, although

374

infection does not stimulate particularly high levels of IFN (72, 88, 89). A number of SARS-CoV-2

375

encoded proteins inhibit IFN production and signaling (83, 90, 91). In infected cells, such inhibition of

376

signaling would limit the antiviral activity of IFNs, as well as limiting the positive feedback amplification

377

that is needed for high level IFN production (92). IFN therapies have been proposed for COVID-19

378

patients (93) and such treatment may induce an antiviral state in uninfected cells, thereby perhaps limiting

379

viral spread if given prophylactically or early during the course of infection (94). However, caution might

380

be warranted for such therapy during later stage COVID-19 as type I and III IFN signaling are shown

381

herein to drive inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and are also known to have pro-

382

inflammatory activities in other settings (92).

383

Herein we also illustrate the use of the hACE2-lentivirus system to study the role of ACE2

384

residues on SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. Only four “mouse-to-human” changes in mACE2 (N30D,

385

F83Y, N31K, H353K) enabled full SARS-CoV-2 replication to levels similar to those seen for infection

386

of hACE2-expressing cells. These results suggest a CRISPR mouse with these substitutions would be

387

able to support SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide a model of COVID-19. Remarkably, a minimum of

388

only two substitutions in mACE2 (N31K, H353K) were sufficient for partial restoration of SARS-CoV-2

389

infection. Changing the same resides in hACE2 to their mouse equivalents (K31N, K353H) did not affect

390

virus replication compared to WT hACE2. Thus N31K and H353K allows binding of SARS-CoV2 to

391

mACE2, but K31N and K353H does not impair binding to hACE2. Both K31N and K353H substitutions

392

were shown to be deleterious for SARS-CoV2 binding by in silico analyses. However, the same analyses

393

implicated >25 other residues in hACE2 binding (31), with many of these potentially able to compensate

394

for the loss of native residues at K31 and K353.

395

In conclusion, we describe the development of a mouse model using intranasal hACE2-lentivirus

396

transduction to sensitize mice lung to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which recapitulated cytokine signatures

397

seen in other mouse models and COVID-19. We demonstrate broad applicability of this new mouse

398

model in vaccine evaluation, GM mice infection, and in vitro evaluation of ACE2 mutants.

MATERIALS and METHODS

547

Ethics statement

548

All mouse work was conducted in accordance with the “Australian code for the care and use of animals

549

for scientific purposes” as defined by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia.

550

Mouse work was approved by the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute animal ethics committee

551

(P3600, A2003-607). For intranasal inoculations, mice were anesthetized using isoflurane. Mice were

552

euthanized using CO2 or cervical dislocation.

553
554

Cell lines and SARS-CoV-2 culture

555

Vero E6 (C1008, ECACC, Wiltshire, England; Sigma Aldridge, St. Louis, MO, USA), HEK293T (a gift

556

from Michel Rist, QIMR Berghofer), Lenti-X 293T (Takara Bio), AE17 (a gift from Delia Nelson,

557

Faculty of Health Sciences, Curtin Medical School), and NIH-3T3 (American Type Culture Collection,

558

ATCC, CRL-1658) cells were cultured in medium comprising DMEM for Lenti-X 293T cells or

559

RPMI1640 for all others (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), penicillin

560

(100IU/ml)/streptomycin (100μg/ml) (Gibco/Life Technologies) and L-glutamine (2 mM) (Life

561

Technologies). Cells were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2. Cells were routinely checked for mycoplasma

562

(MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit MycoAlert, Lonza) and FCS was assayed for endotoxin

563

contamination before purchase (96). The SARS-CoV-2 isolate was kindly provided by Queensland

564

Health Forensic & Scientific Services, Queensland Department of Health, Brisbane, Australia. The virus

565

(hCoV-19/Australia/QLD02/2020) was isolated from a patient and sequence deposited at GISAID

566

(https://www.gisaid.org/; after registration and login, sequence can be downloaded from

567

https://www.epicov.org/epi3/frontend#1707af). Virus stock was generated by infection of Vero E6 cells

568

at multiplicity of infection (MOI)≈0.01, with supernatant collected after 2-3 days, cell debris removed by

569

centrifugation at 3000 x g for 15 min at 4°C, and virus aliquoted and stored at -80°C. Virus titers were

570

determined using standard CCID50 assays (see below). The virus was determined to be mycoplasma free

571

using co-culture with a non-permissive cell line (i.e. HeLa) and Hoechst staining as described (97).

CCID50 assays

574

Vero E6 cells were plated into 96 well flat bottom plates at 2x104 cells per well in 100 µl of medium. For

575

tissue titer, tissue was homogenized in tubes each containing 4 ceramic beads twice at 6000 x g for 15

576

seconds, followed by centrifugation twice at 21000 x g for 5 min before 5 fold serial dilutions in 100 µl

577

RPMI1640 supplemented with 2% FCS. For cell culture supernatant, 10 fold serial dilutions were

578

performed in 100 µl RPMI1640 supplemented with 2% FCS. 100 µl of serially diluted samples were

579

added to Vero E6 cells and the plates cultured for 5 days at 37°C and 5% CO2. The virus titer was

580

determined by the method of Spearman and Karber (a convenient Excel CCID50 calculator is available at

581

https://www.klinikum.uni-heidelberg.de/zentrum-fuer-infektiologie/molecular-

582

584

Lentivirus cloning

585

ACE2 genes were cloned into pCDH-EF1α-MCS-BGH-PGK-GFP-T2A-Puro Cloning and Expression

586

Lentivector (System Biosciences, catalogue number CD550A-1), where the EF1α promoter was replaced

587

with the full length EF1α using NheI and ClaI restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs). Human ACE2

588

coding sequence (codon optimized for mouse) was cloned into the pCDH lentivector with PCR fragments

589

amplified using Q5® High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and the following primers;

590

vector backbone (pCDH amplified with Forward 5’- TAAATCGGATCCGCGG -3’ and Reverse 5’-

591

AATTCGAATTCGCTAGC) and hACE2 insert (Forward 5’-

592

GCTAGCGAATTCGAATTATGAGCAGCAGCTCTTGGC -3’ and Reverse 5’-

593

CCGCGGATCGCATTTATCAGAAGCTTGTCTGCACGT -3’). The pCDH fragment was digested with

594

DpnI (New England Biolabs) and was purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN), as was the

595

hACE2 fragment. Fragments were recombined using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Cloning Kit as per

596

manufacturer instructions. This was transformed into NEB® 10-beta Competent E. coli (High Efficiency)

597

(New England Biolabs) as per manufacturer instructions and plated on ampicillin agar plates overnight.

598

Colony PCR was performed using Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and the

599

hACE2 insert primers to identify a positive colony, which was grown in LB broth with ampicillin and

600

plasmid was purified using NucleoBond Xtra Midi kit (Machery Nagel).

601

All ACE2 mutant coding sequences were ordered from Twist Bioscience/Decode Science containing

602

EcoRI upstream and BamHI downstream. Fragments were amplified using the using Q5® High-Fidelity

603

2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and the following primers; Forward 5’-

604

CCTGACCTTAGCGAATTCATG -3’ and Reverse 5’- ACCTAGCCTCGCGGATC -3’. PCR fragments

605

were purified using Monarch DNA Gel Extraction Kit (New England Biolabs), and were digested with

606

EcoRI and BamHI (New England Biolabs), as was the pCDH vector before purification again with

607

Monarch® DNA Gel Extraction Kit (New England Biolabs). The ACE2 fragment was ligated with

608

pCDH vector using T4 DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs) as per manufacturer instructions and then

609

transformed into NEB® 10-beta Competent E. coli (High Efficiency) (New England Biolabs) as per

manufacturer instructions and plated on ampicillin agar plates overnight. Colonies were grown in LB

611

broth with ampicillin and plasmid was purified using NucleoBond Xtra Midi kit (Machery Nagel).

612

Plasmids were confirmed by PCR with the cloning primers above and fragments were gel purified and

613

confirmed by Sanger sequencing with the forward primer.

614
615

Lentivirus production, titration and cell line transduction

616

ACE2 lentivirus was produced by co-transfection of HEK293T or Lenti-X HEK293T cells with the

617

pCDH-ACE2 plasmid, VSV-G and Gag-Pol using Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Thermo Fisher

618

Scientific) or Xfect Transfection Reagent (Takara Bio) as per manufacturer instructions. Supernatant was

619

collected 2 days after transfection and centrifuged at 500 x g for 10 min, and this was concentrated using

620

Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units with 100 kDa cutoff (Merck Millipore) as per manufacturer

621

instructions. Lentivirus was titrated by serial dilution of lentivirus and incubating with 5000 HEK293T

622

cells in 96 well plates with 8 µg/ml polybrene for 3 days followed by GFP detection by flow cytometry

623

(BD Biosciences LSRFortessa). Transduction units (TU) per ml was calculated by percentage of 5000

624

cells that are GFP positive multiplied by the dilution. For example if 2 µl lentivirus gives 5% GFP

625

positive cells, the TU/ml is ((5/100)*5000) * (1000/2) = 125,000 TU/ml. The p24 equivalent (ng/ml) was

626

measured using Lenti-X GoStix Plus (Takara Bio) as per manufacturer instructions.

627

Cell lines were transduced by incubating with lentivirus and 8 µg/ml polybrene for 2-3 days followed by 5

628

µg/ml puromycin treatment until most resistant cells expressed GFP. Cells were then infected with

629

SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.1 for 1 hr at 37°C, cells were washed with PBS and media replaced. Culture

630

supernatant was harvested at the indicated timepoints and titered by CCID50 assay as described.

631
632

SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD:ACE2 mutagenesis modeling

633

PyMOL v4.60 (Schrodinger) was used for mutagenesis of the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike

634

receptor-binding domain bound with ACE2 from the protein data bank (6M0J) (95). The side chain

635

orientation (rotamer) with highest frequency of occurrence in proteins was chosen for all mutations. Polar

636

interactions (blue lines) or any interactions within 3.5Å (yellow lines) were shown for selected residues.

637

The K417N and N501Y mutations in the UK variant (B.1.1.7) and RSA variant (B.1.351) were introduced

638

(38).

UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine preparation and mice immunization

641

120 ml of SARS-CoV-2 was inactivated with at least 7650 J/m2 UVC in a UVC 500 Ultraviolet

642

Crosslinker (Hoefer). Virus was determined to be inactivated by incubation with Vero E6 cells for 4 days

643

without development of CPE. UV-inactive SARS-CoV-2 was then partially-purified using a 20% sucrose

644

cushion centrifuged at 175,000 x g for 3-4 hr using SW32Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter). The sample that

645

has passed through the sucrose was collected and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter

646

Units with 100 kDa cutoff (Merck Millipore). For infectious SARS-CoV-2 immunization, virus was also

647

concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units with 100 kDa cutoff (Merck Millipore).

648

Mice were injected s.c. in the base of the tail with 100 µl of UV-inactive or infectious SARS-CoV-2 with

649

25 µg adjuvant in 50 µl made with the same ingredients as AS01 (98) as described previously (99). A

653

Neutralization assay

654

Mouse serum was heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 min and incubated with 100 CCID50 SARS-CoV-2 for 2

655

hr at 37°C before adding 105 Vero cells/well in a 96 well plate to 200 µl. After 4 days cells were fixed and

656

stained by adding 50 µl formaldehyde (15% w/v) and crystal violet (0.1% w/v) (Sigma-Aldrich)

657

overnight. The plates were washed in tap water, dried overnight and 100 µl/well of 100% methanol added

658

to dissolve the crystal violet and the OD was read at 595 nm using a 96-well plate reader (Biotek Synergy

659

H4). The 50% neutralizing titers were interpolated from optical density (OD) versus dilution plots.

C57BL/6J, IFNAR-/- (100) (originally provided by P. Hertzog, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC,

663

Australia) and IL-28RA-/- mice (71, 101) were kindly provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb (102) and bred

664

in-house at QIMRB. Female mice were 8 weeks to 1 year old (age matched between groups) at the start

665

of the experiment. Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane and 4 µl of 1% L-α-Lysophosphatidylcholine

666

from egg yolk (Sigma Aldrich) in water was administered intranasally. After 1 hour mice were inoculated

667

intranasally with approximately 2×104 TU of hACE2-pCDH lentivirus in 50 µl, and 1 week later

668

challenged with 105 CCID50 SARS-CoV-2 intranasally in 50 µl. Mice were sacrificed by cervical

669

dislocation at day 2, 4 or 6 and lungs were collected. Right lung was immediately homogenized in tubes

670

each containing 4 beads twice at 6000 x g for 15 seconds, and used in tissue titration as described above.

671

Left lung was placed in RNAprotect Tissue Reagent (QIAGEN) at 4°C overnight then -80°C.

672

K18-hACE2 mice (6) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and bred in-house at QIMRB with

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

730

Preranked GSEA (113) was performed on a desktop application (GSEA v4.0.3)

731

(http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/) using the “GSEAPreranked” module. Gene sets from the

732

supplemental materials from the Winkler et al. (9), Blanco-Melo et al. (51) and Wu et al. (52)

733

(filename.GMT) studies were investigated for enrichment in our pre-ranked all gene list for SARS-CoV-2

734

infected day 2 mice lung comparing plus versus minus ACE2 (Supplementary Table 2B). Li et al. (76)

735

blood transcription modules (BTM_for_GSEA_20131008.gmt, n = 346) was also used in GSEA to

736

determine enrichment in our ‘immunized’ versus unvaccinated mice lung at day 2 (Supplementary Table

737

5B). The complete Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) v7.2 gene set collection (31,120 gene sets)

Statistics

749

Statistical analyses of experimental data were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows,

750

Version 19.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The t-test was used when the difference in variances was

751

<4, skewness was >2 and kurtosis was <2. Otherwise, the non-parametric Kolmogorov–Smirnov test or

lines. Growth kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 over a three day time course in untransduced or hACE2-lentivirus

757

transduced 3T3 or AE17 cells infected at MOI=0.1. Data is the mean of triplicate wells and error bars

758

represent SEM. Images of cells were taken using an inverted light microscope at day 3 post-infection and

759

are representative of triplicate wells.

Supplementary Figure 3. SARS-CoV-2 and hACE2 read counts in RNA-Seq data. RNA-Seq was

766

performed on mice lung from the same mice as in ‘Figure 2’. A) SARS-CoV-2 read counts normalized to

767

total read count. Data points below the horizontal dotted line had read counts of zero. B) hACE2 read

768

counts normalised to total read count. Data points below the horizontal dotted line had read counts of

769

zero. C) SARS-CoV-2 read count normalised to hACE2 read count. Circle with pink dotted outline had

770

hACE2 read count of 0, so the value was set to the SARS-CoV-2 read count (not normalised). D) SARS-

771

CoV-2 reads aligned to reference genome viewed in Integrative Genome Viewer (IGV). Mice with

772

hACE2 displayed reads mapped across the entire genome, with higher counts for structural gene sub-

773

genomic RNA as also evident in hACE2-adenoviral vector transduced cell lines (51).
