SUMMARY
The continued threat of SARS-CoV-2 to global health necessitates development of improved
research tools and vaccines. We present an improved SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain, “VFLIP”,
bearing five proline substitutions, a flexible cleavage site linker, and an inter-protomer disulfide
bond. VFLIP displays significantly improved stability, high-yield production and retains its
trimeric state without exogenous trimerization motifs. High-resolution cryo-EM and glycan
profiling reveal that the VFLIP quaternary structure and glycosylation mimic the native spike on
the viral surface. Further, VFLIP has enhanced affinity and binding kinetics relative to other
stabilized spike proteins for antibodies in the Coronavirus Immunotherapeutic Consortium
(CoVIC), and mice immunized with VFLIP exhibit potent neutralizing antibody responses against
wild-type and B.1.351 live SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, VFLIP represents an improved tool for
diagnostics, structural biology, antibody discovery, and vaccine design.

INTRODUCTION
The likely persistence of SARS-CoV-2 necessitates development of improved research
tools, diagnostic reagents, and next-generation vaccine candidates. Vaccine approaches in
progress involve inactivated virus, viral vectors, protein subunits, and liposome-encapsulated
mRNA (Krammer 2020). Despite their different modes of delivery, all of these platforms use the
SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein spike as the primary target. Spike is a metastable,
membrane-anchored, class I fusion protein that exists as a trimer on the viral surface. A multibasic furin cleavage site (residues 682-685) delineates the boundary between the spike S1
(receptor-binding) and S2 (membrane fusion) domain subunits. A second cleavage site, S2', lies
downstream of the furin site and is cleaved by TMPRSS2 on the target cell surface or cathepsin
L following endocytic uptake. Cleavage at both S1/S2 and S2' facilitates liberation of the fusion
peptide and triggering of structural rearrangements that promote the pre-fusion to post-fusion
transition and drive virus and host membrane fusion (Shang, Wan, Luo, et al. 2020; Sacco et al.
2020). The inherent instability of the prefusion state complicates use of spike and spike
ectodomains in vaccines, diagnostics, and research applications as presentation of the native
quaternary structure is critical for eliciting and detecting potently neutralizing conformationdependent antibodies (Liu et al. 2020; Cai et al. 2020). Substantial effort has been devoted to
developing versions of the spike glycoprotein that retain its immunologically relevant, native-like
prefusion state.
On the virion surface, ～97% of the spikes exist in the metastable pre-fusion
conformation (Ke et al. 2020). While in this pre-fusion state, the S1 domains of the spike exhibit
dynamic motion. The receptor-binding domains (RBDs) that lie at the apex of the spike are
begin predominantly in a “down” conformation with the receptor-binding motif (RBM) buried by
RBD-RBD interfaces that together form a trefoil structure (Lu et al. 2020; Yao et al. 2020).
Transiently, or upon interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on

the target cell surface, the RBDs lift up sequentially and the corresponding N-terminal domains
(NTD) undergo rotational movements. Transition of the RBD to the “up” state reduces the
contact surface area between adjacent RBDs and with the NTD, eventually leading to
dissociation of S1 from the S2 subunit and promoting S2 transition to the post-fusion state (Lu et
al. 2020). Engineered spikes used for immunogens and research tools should not only preserve
the prefusion trimeric assembly, but also the native positioning of RBDs and RBD motion. In
addition, accurate reflection of glycans presented on the native virion is key for eliciting and
detecting antibodies induced by infection or vaccination (He et al. 2018; Cao et al. 2017; Sun et
al. 2013; Grant et al. 2020).
Vaccines currently deployed in the United States use a derivative of the prototypical,
first-generation “S-2P” spike design (Pallesen et al. 2017), which contains two proline
substitutions at positions 986 and 987 (Polack et al. 2020; Bos et al. 2020; Corbett et al. 2020;
Wrapp et al. 2020). These vaccines have shown high efficacy in the short term, but the rapid
timeframe for development has afforded few opportunities for antigen optimization. Recent work
by Hsieh et al. illustrated that the S-2P spike exhibits relatively low yield and unfavorable purity
(Hsieh et al. 2020). The poor yield may impact cost and manufacturability of vaccine candidates,
and limit expression levels in vaccinated individuals, which in turn could necessitate higher
doses and potentially increased reactogenicity. Moreover, several studies reported that S-2P
protein preparations exhibit sensitivity to cold-temperature storage (Edwards et al. 2020; Xiong
et al. 2020). Edwards et al. used negative-stain electron microscopy (NSEM) to demonstrate a
95% loss of well-formed S-2P spike trimers after 5-7 days of storage at 4˚C. Exposure to 4˚C
temperatures also resulted in lower thermostability and altered binding to monoclonal antibody
(mAb) CR3022, suggesting perturbed structure and antigenicity.
A second-generation spike construct, termed “HexaPro”, contains four additional
prolines at positions 817, 892, 899 and 942. HexaPro expresses to levels nearly 10-fold higher

than those for wild-type spike or S-2P, has a 5 °C higher melting temperature (Tm) (Hsieh et al.
2020), and displays improved stability relative to S-2P under low-temperature storage and
multiple freeze-thaw cycles (Edwards et al. 2020). Importantly, binding assays and cryoEM
indicated that HexaPro better retains the native prefusion quaternary structure compared to S2P, despite still exhibiting minor reductions in thermostability and mAb binding following
incubation at 4 °C.
Both S-2P and HexaPro, however, are prone to antibody- and ACE2-mediated triggering
of conformational change to the post-fusion state (Huo et al. 2020; Ge et al. 2021; Xiong et al.
2020). This triggering complicates structural analysis of mAb-spike and ACE2-spike complexes
and may affect immunogenicity upon vaccination. Several spike constructs such as SR/X2
prevent this fusogenic activity with introduction of an inter-protomer disulfide bond, linking the
RBD and the S2 subunits to “lock” the RBDs in the “down” conformation (Xiong et al. 2020;
Henderson et al. 2020). Although these “locked-down” spike proteins maintain the trimeric state,
the location of the inter-protomer disulfide bond prevents the natural hinge motion of the RBD
and ablates binding to ACE2 and “RBD-up” antibodies, which are among the most potent
neutralizers (Rogers et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020; Huo et al. 2020; Brouwer et al. 2020).
Furthermore, cryo-EM structures of a locked-down spike show that the RBDs are rotated 2Å
closer to the three-fold axis relative to wildtype (Xiong et al. 2020). These quaternary structure
perturbations, together with locking of the RBD into an “all-down” state, could prevent elicitation
and detection of protective antibodies against neutralizing epitopes that are only accessible in
the “up” or mixed up/down conformation (Rogers et al. 2020; Huo et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020;
Brouwer et al. 2020). Even antibodies that target the ”all-down” RBD conformation could be
affected, particularly those that bridge two RBDs, such as the potent neutralizing mAbs S2M11,
Nb6, and C144 (Schoof et al. 2020; Tortorici et al. 2020; Robbiani et al. 2020). Thus, a spike

immunogen that preserves the natural RBD positioning and conformational dynamics is
essential for maintaining the native antigenic landscape.
A central goal for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is to reduce incidence of symptomatic disease
through generation of enduring protective immunity. However, the recent emergence of SARSCoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) poses a risk to first-generation vaccine efficacy and durability
of both infection- and vaccine-induced humoral immunity. Lineage B.1.351 (informally known as
the South African variant) is particularly concerning due to substitutions that confer increased
transmissibility and reduced sensitivity to neutralization by heterotypic convalescent and
vaccine-induced sera. Development of structurally designed vaccine candidates with improved
immunogenicity and breadth of coverage is critical for controlling emergent VOC.
To address these issues associated with current spike constructs and emergence of
VOC, we performed iterative design of spike proteins containing different proline substitutions,
cleavage site linkers, and interprotomer disulfide bonds. We describe the production of “VFLIP”
(five (V) prolines, Flexibly-Linked, Inter-Protomer disulfide) spikes that remain trimeric without
exogenous trimerization motifs, and which have enhanced thermostability relative to earlier
spike constructs. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and cryo-EM analysis confirm the nativelike antigenicity of VFLIP and its improved utility for structural biology applications. Moreover,
mice immunized with the VFLIP spike elicited significantly more potent neutralizing antibody
responses against live SARS-CoV-2 D614G and B.1.351 compared to those immunized with S2P. Taken together, our data indicate that VFLIP is a thermostable, covalently-linked, native-like
spike trimer that represents a promising next-generation research reagent, diagnostic tool, and
vaccine candidate.

RESULTS
Iterative design of the VFLIP spike immunogen
In the SARS-CoV-2 spike, the S1/S2 furin cleavage site is located in a flexible external
loop (residues 675-691) that can enhance triggering of the post-fusion conformation (Shang,
Wan, Liu, et al. 2020). However, the sequence of this loop varies among coronavirus species
and is absent in the closely related SARS-CoV and RaTG13 (Walls, Park, et al. 2020)".
Considering this lack of sequence conservation and role in trimer metastability, we hypothesized
that replacing 15-aa of the loop (residues 676-690) with a shorter, rigid (Gly-Pro) or flexible (GlyGly-Gly-Ser) linker may improve stability and yield without disturbing the quaternary structure or
native antigenicity (Figure 1A and Supp. Table 2). Five constructs bearing linkers of differing
rigidity and length were evaluated. Constructs 1 and 2 have flexible Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser linkers
(termed FL1 and FL2 for Flexible Linker) and constructs 3-4 have rigid Gly-Pro linkers (RL3-RL4
for Rigid Linker) (Supp. Table 1). Expression of SARS S-2P_FL1 or S-2P_FL2 resulted in a 2-4
fold greater yield of trimeric spike over S-2P in both HEK293F and ExpiCHO cells (Supp. Table.
1).
We next explored the relative impact of these linkers in the context of the six-proline
(6P)-bearing spike, with the six prolines representing those in HexaPro (Hsieh et al. 2020). The
6P_RL constructs bearing rigid linkers had slightly lower expression levels relative to HexaPro.
In contrast, the flexibly-linked 6P_FL1 and 6P_FL2 constructs had approximately equivalent or
increased yields compared to HexaPro, with 6P_FL2 averaging 15.6 mg/L in HEK293F and 184
mg/L in ExpiCHO cells. Dynamic scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis showed a ~1 ˚C increase
in melting temperature (Tm) for all tested linkers (flexible or rigid) relative to the parental
HexaPro (Figure 1E). The FL2 linker, which had the best performance in terms of yield and
stability, was selected for further use.

Both S-2P and HexaPro have a proline substitution at residue 986 (K986P). However,
multiple studies have suggested a role for K986 in mediating the RBD conformational state and
S2 stability via electrostatic interactions with D427 (Xiong et al. 2020; Cai et al. 2020; Gobeil et
al. 2021) and/or D748 (Juraszek et al. 2021), respectively. Juraszek et al. also showed that
spikes bearing the K986P mutation have a substantially larger fraction of “RBD-up” spikes and
reduced thermostability. We therefore modified the six-proline-containing FL2 spike (6P_FL2) by
reverting the K986P mutation back to wild-type K986 to generate the “5P_FL2” construct. When
transfected in HEK293F cells, 5P_FL2 expresses an average of 40% higher than HexaPro and
23% higher in ExpiCHO cells. DSC indicates that 5P_FL2 indeed has greater thermostability
than 6P_FL2 (Figure 1E), consistent with Juraszek et al. (2021). The 5P_FL2 construct allows
production of highly pure, well-formed trimers as confirmed by size-exclusion-chromatography
(SEC) (Figure 1B) and negative-stain electron microscopy (NSEM) (Figure 1D).
Introduction of disulfide bonds can substantially increase the stability of viral
glycoproteins, as has been demonstrated for HIV, LASV and RSV (Stewart-Jones et al. 2015;
Hastie et al. 2017; McLellan et al. 2013). We identified and tested a set of eight inter-protomeric
disulfide bonds (DS1-DS8) for their ability to improve stability of the trimer. After an initial
screening in the S-2P background, the best disulfide bond candidates were transferred to the
6P background for further analysis. Among the disulfide-linked spikes, the 6P_DS3 construct
(Y707C/T883C) displayed the best yield and quality (purity and homogeneity of oligomerization
state) following purification (Figure 1C, Supp. Table S1). When analyzed by non-reducing SDSPAGE, the 6P_DS3 construct retains its covalently-linked trimeric state (>250 kDa) without
detectable low molecular weight species, indicating efficient disulfide bond formation. Upon
reduction with DTT, 6P_DS3 runs at the monomeric molecular weight of the non-disulfide linked
constructs (~180 kDa). SEC and NSEM confirmed that 6P_DS3 expresses as a highly
homogeneous population of well-formed pre-fusion spike trimers. Although addition of the DS3

disulfide bond reduces total yield ~12% relative to 6P alone, it does increase thermostability
slightly (0.5 ˚C increase in melting temperature) as measured by DSC, but more importantly,
robustly maintains its trimeric state (Figure 1E).
Given the improvements in yield and stability afforded by the 5P background, the flexible
FL2 linker, and the DS3 disulfide bond individually, we then generated 5P_FL2_DS3, which
combines the three modifications. This construct is hereafter termed VFLIP spike for 5 (V)
proline, Flexibly-Linked, Inter-Protomer bonded spike. The VFLIP spike exhibits the best
thermostability of the constructs tested here, with a Tm that is 2.9 ˚C higher than that for
HexaPro (Figure 1E). VFLIP is efficiently expressed in both HEK293F and ExpiCHO cells, with
an average yield of 7.1 mg/L and 157 mg/L, respectively. Hence, the VFLIP spike was deemed
a promising antigen suitable for in-depth characterization.

Structural characterization of the engineered VFLIP and VFLIP_D614G spikes
We analyzed VFLIP by high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to
understand the molecular mechanisms underlying its increased stability. We also obtained a
high-resolution cryo-EM structure for a VFLIP variant bearing the now globally fixed D614G
mutation (Korber et al. 2020). From a single VFLIP dataset, we identified a population of
166,085 particles, to produce a density map having an overall resolution of 3.0 Å with no applied
C3 symmetry (Figs. 2A and Supp. Figure S1). For VFLIP_D614G, a population of 213,852
particles yielded a 2.8Å resolution structure (Figure S2). Importantly, the density maps confirm
the successful formation of the DS3 disulfide bond (Y707C/T883C) and the K986/E748 saltbridge interaction (Figure 2B and Supp. Figure S3).
Extensive classification and data processing reveal >90% predominantly closed trimers,
with all RBDs “down” for both VFLIP and VFLIP_D614G. Further sub-classification revealed an
overall architecture that is similar to other "closed" spikes in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The

improved order of this construct allows visualization of portions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike that
are rarely visible in other cryoEM structures. For example, the peptide backbone of the region
extending from residues 618-641, which fits/wedges between RBD and NTD, can now be traced
(Figure 2B). The fusion peptide proximal region (FPPR) extending from residues 829-851 that
contains the C840-C851 disulfide bond, is also now well-ordered in VFLIP (Figure 2B). This loop
packs against the S2 helical core and nestles beside the 630 loop and underneath CTD2 of the
adjacent protomer to provide stability through pi-stacking interactions (Benton et al. 2020).

Native-like glycosylation of VFLIP expressed in HEK293F and ExpiCHO cells
A protein used as an immunogen or as a research tool to detect antibodies should
present the native glycosylation profile (Grant et al. 2020; Sun et al. 2013; Raska et al. 2010;
Watanabe et al. 2020; He et al. 2018). In SARS-CoV-2 spike, glycans play a major role in RBD
positioning and trimer stability (Casalino et al. 2020; Sztain et al. 2021). Thus, recapitulating
native glycoforms is likely important to preserve antigenicity. We used liquid chromatography
coupled with electron transfer/high energy collision dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS) to determine the glycosylation profiles of VFLIP produced in HEK293T and ExpiCHO
cell lines, and compared these profiles to previously published data for S-2P and virionassociated spikes (Yao et al. 2020; Watanabe et al. 2020). We detected N-linked glycopeptides
at 20 of 22 predicted glycosylation sequons (with N17 and N1158 not covered in our
experiments), and measured the associated diversity in glycan processing (Figure 3A). A full
overview of the site-specific individual glycoforms is presented in Supplementary Figure S4.
Similar to native virions and S-2P, the glycosylation pattern in both 5P and VFLIP spikes is
dominated by complex glycosylation, with selected sites enriched in underprocessed, highmannose glycans. The pattern of glycan processing of VFLIP produced in HEK293F or
ExpiCHO cells was highly similar. Glycans of the S1 subunit, including those located within the
RBD (N331 and N343) and those modulating its up/down conformation (N165 and N234), were

similarly processed between VFLIP spikes or 5P spikes. Likewise, glycans at the base of the S2
subunit (N1074, N1098, N1134, N1173 and N1194) were similar in 5P and VFLIP spikes.
However, N-glycan patterns for 5P and VFLIP differed near the middle of the spike, particularly
for glycans N603, N616, N709, and N801, which were largely underprocessed in 5P spikes
(Figs. 3A-C). Previous glycan analysis of the S-2P spike revealed similar underprocessing at
these glycan positions compared to the native virion (Frese et al. 2012, 2013), where these
glycan sites were found to be predominantly complex-type and more similar to VFLIP produced
from both HEK293F and ExpiCHO (Figure 3C). Taken together, these data indicate that VFLIP
spikes more accurately reflect glycosylation patterns of the native spike, and that VFLIP spikes
produced in HEK293F and ExpiCHO have nearly identical glycan composition.

Epitope mapping and binding kinetics of over 100 mAbs
To verify whether introduced modifications could affect functional epitopes, we probed
VFLIP antigenicity by analyzing recognition of 136 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from the
Coronavirus Immunotherapeutic Consortium (CoVIC). HexaPro, which shows a high proportion
of one or more RBDs in the up state, and 5P_FL5_DS2 (referred to here as DS2), a lockeddown spike, were used for comparison, along with soluble RBD. High-throughput surface
plasmon resonance (SPR) based assays revealed distinct IgG affinities for each analyzed
antigen (Figure 4A). Both the association rate (ka) and apparent dissociation rate (kd) of the
mAbs for VFLIP were slightly slower than that for HexaPro, but the resulting sub-nanomolar
affinities were similar between VFLIP and HexaPro for most mAbs. The slower association rate
observed for some VFLIP-antibody interactions may be due to the predominantly "all-down"
initial conformation and the additional stability provided by the well-ordered 630 loop and FPPR
that likely slow RBD state transition. The slower dissociation constant, however, restores overall
affinity and may facilitate isolation of antibody:spike complexes for structural analyses.

In contrast, around 30% of the mAbs tested had at least 10-fold lower affinity for the
locked-down DS2 spike relative toVFLIP. As expected, soluble monomeric RBD exhibited the
highest association rate for most antibodies, but also had a much higher dissociation rate, and
no potential for avidity as seen with the trimers, and thus bound to mAbs with 10-100 fold lower
apparent affinity. Overall, our data suggests that VFLIP maintains native-like antigenicity and
binding to mAbs of potential clinical interest, further supporting its utility as a candidate spike
antigen.
Considering that unbound VFLIP is mostly in a closed conformation, yet still binds to
RBD-up antibodies, we sought to determine the structure of VFLIP in complex with RBD-binding
mAbs. We obtained high-resolution cryo-EM structures of VFLIP in the "up" conformation by
complexing with a Fab from the therapeutic candidates HLX70 (mAb) and HLX71 (an ACE2-Fc
fusion protein) (Figure 4B and Suppl. Figs. S5 and S6). Both candidates are currently in clinical
trials (NCT04561076 and NCT04583228, respectively) (“Evaluate Safety and Pharmacokinetics
of HLX70 in Healthy Adult Volunteers” n.d.)(“Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability,
Pharmacodynamics, Pharmacokinetics, and Immunogenicity of HLX71 (Recombinant Human
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2-Fc Fusion Protein for COVID-19) in Healthy Adult Subjects”
n.d.). Single-particle reconstruction of the VFLIP-HLX70 Fab complex produced a 3.6 Å
structure that revealed a unique conformation and a fully occupied 3:1 ratio for Fab:spike, with
one RBD “up” and two RBDs “down” (Figure 4B). For the VFLIP-ACE2-Fc complex, the major
population displayed three RBDs in the up-state with full occupancy by three ACE2 molecules.
This structure was resolved to 4.6 Å. The stoichiometry of one VFLIP bound to three copies of
ACE2 is consistent with previous ACE2-bound structures, and demonstrates that VFLIP
modifications do not abrogate RBD re-positioning or binding to RBD-up antibodies.

VFLIPΔFoldon remains a stable trimer under diverse biochemical conditions
Most soluble versions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike have a T4 phage fibritin trimerization
motif (termed Foldon, PDB ID: 1RFO) at the C-terminus of the ectodomain (Güthe et al. 2004;
Wrapp et al. 2020; Henderson et al. 2020; Xiong et al. 2020; Hsieh et al. 2020). Foldon is,
however, immunogenic and may influence the anti-spike immune response (Sliepen et al. 2015;
Lainšček et al. 2020). Thus, we designed a VFLIP construct containing an HRV-3C site between
the C-terminus of the spike and the Foldon domain that allowed its selective removal following
purification to produce a protein termed VFLIP∆Foldon (Figure 5A).
To determine the impact of removing the Foldon domain on spike stability, we subjected
VFLIPΔFoldon to biochemical stress tests. Initial SEC analysis of purified VFLIPΔFoldon
showed a narrow single peak centered at 13 ml with no detectable aggregation or lower
molecular weight species (Figure 5A). Under the same proteolytic treatment, HexaProΔFoldon
consistently eluted as a double peak (13 ml and 15 ml), with 15% of the total mass
corresponding to the lower molecular weight species (Figure 5A).
VFLIPΔFoldon also remains stable after prolonged (> 1 month) storage at room
temperature, 4 °C and 37 °C (conditions that cause a portion of HexaPro trimers to dissociate
into species having a lower molecular weight consistent with that for monomers), as well as
lyophilization and multiple freeze/thaw cycles (Figure 5C). Thus, in addition to improved stability
under standard purification conditions, VFLIP exhibits resistance to adverse conditions, even
without an exogenous trimerization domain.

VFLIP enables structural characterization of receptor-mimicking antibodies and ACE2
ACE2 and many RBD-targeted antibodies exhibit fusogenic activity and trigger transition
of the spike to the post-fusion structure upon binding (Huo et al. 2020). Various methods have

been implemented to circumvent this issue, such as use of cross-linking agents (Xu et al. 2021)
or minute-scale incubation prior to freezing grids (Benton et al. 2020). However, such
approaches often produce samples having poor or no occupancy that complicates structural
determination (Benton et al. 2020; T. Zhou et al. 2020). Some studies successfully identified
fully occupied HexaPro:ACE2 complexes, but these particles were rare and represented as little
as 3% of the total particle population (Benton et al. 2020).
To address this issue, we generated complexes of soluble human ACE2 (shACE2) with
HexaProΔFoldon or VFLIPΔFoldon and purified them by SEC (Figure 5D). For
HexaProΔFoldon, only ～15% of the total mass corresponded to trimeric spike bound to ACE2,
and the remainder eluted as monomeric S bound to ACE2 at 14 ml. In contrast, VFLIP:ACE2
complexes eluted as a single peak at 12 ml, indicating consistent occupancy and lack of trimer
dissociation. This result corresponds to our high-resolution cryo-EM structure showing three
ACE2 molecules bound to each spike (Figure 4B). Multiple studies have noted that some
antibodies against the RBD “split” spike into monomers (Walls, Xiong, et al. 2020; Koenig et al.
2021). The mAb B6 is one such spike-splitting antibody. When the Fab of B6 is complexed with
HexaProΔFoldon, ~90% of the HexaPro spike separates to monomers. In contrast, complexes
of B6 Fab with VFLIP∆Foldon retain the trimeric spike assembly, and exist in complete
occupancy, one spike trimer to three Fab fragments (Figure 5E).

VFLIP elicits potently neutralizing responses in immunized mice
We hypothesized that the additional stability afforded by VFLIP may improve elicitation
of neutralizing antibodies and that removing Foldon (VFLIPΔFoldon) may avoid deleterious
responses to this exogenous trimerization domain. To assess the immunogenicity of VFLIP, we
immunized BALB/c mice with four versions of spike: (1) Parental S-2P, (2) HexaPro, (3) VFLIP,
and (4) VFLIPΔFoldon. Ten mice per group were immunized intramuscularly (i.m.) with 25 μg

purified spike adjuvanted with CpG + alum and boosted with the same four weeks later. An
interim blood draw was performed two weeks after the prime, and a final blood draw was taken
two weeks after the boost. Overall, mice in all five groups mounted robust antibody responses
as evidenced by total anti-spike antibody titers (Figure 6B). Sera from immunized mice were
used to examine activity in neutralization assays using rVSV-pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2
spike bearing the D614G mutation, as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2 bearing the D614G
substitution and authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus of the B.1.351 (South African) lineage, which is a
current variant of concern. Pseudovirus neutralization titers for VFLIP-immunized sera were
somewhat higher than HexaPro and achieved 50% neutralization at dilutions over 1:100,000.
Assays using authentic D614G and B.1.351 showed that VFLIP-induced sera had a higher
neutralizing potency compared to S-2P, with 50% neutralization at dilutions of 1:30,000 and
1:13,000, respectively (Fig, 6 D,E). Pseudovirus neutralization of VFLIP-∆Foldon (with
trimerization domain removed) was equivalent to that for Foldon-containing HexaPro, indicating
that immunogenicity is maintained without an exogenous trimerization motif (Figure 6C).

DISCUSSION

The SARS-CoV2 spike (S) protein, in its pre-fusion assembly on the virion surface, is the
main target of neutralizing and protective antibodies. A stabilized spike that maintains a prefusion conformation and trimeric assembly, as well as the natural RBD dynamics, is essential for
development of effective vaccine candidates and research reagents. Such a molecule would
ensure that the native quaternary structure is maintained to allow binding and elicitation of
conformation-dependent neutralizing antibodies. Most vaccine candidates now in use or in
clinical trials employ derivatives of the prototypical “2P” spike that carries two prolines. However,
thermostability and yield of S-2P are both low. Improvements in yield, thermostability and
quaternary structure of expressed spike protein would likely improve immunogenicity, efficacy,
manufacturability and distribution of vaccines.
A second-generation spike construct, HexaPro, carries four additional prolines and offers
greater yield and stability relative to S-2P. One proline substitution in both S-2P and HexaPro is
K986P. The wild-type K986, however, forms salt bridge interactions that afford stability to the
pre-fusion structure; for example, K986-D748 stabilizes the S2 core and K486-D427 is important
for initial RBD positioning in the down position (Juraszek et al. 2021; Cai et al. 2020). In this
study, we also show that HexaPro possesses some glycosylation patterns on S2 that are
inconsistent with the authentic virus. Other versions of engineered spike introduce a disulfide
bond to anchor the RBDs in the down position. This anchoring does not permit elicitation of, or
binding by those antibodies that target the inner and upper surfaces of the RBD that are
exposed upon transition to the up conformation. These various structural features and altered
glycosylation together may alter immunogenicity and limit utility of early generation spikes.
In this work, we generated a spike antigen and vaccine candidate, VFLIP, which more
effectively recapitulates the structural and antigenic properties of the native spike. Modifications
in the VFLIP spike include: (i) a short flexible linker that replaces the S1/S2 cleavage fusion loop
to prevent loss of S1 and springing of S2 to its post-fusion conformation; (ii) restoration of native

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.06.441046; this version posted May 6, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

Lys at position 986 to preserve the stabilizing K986-mediated salt bridges; and (iii) a disulfide
bond at the base of spike between the S2 of one protomer and the S2’ of the adjacent protomer
to maintain native trimerization without exogenous motifs.
The resulting VFLIP spike expresses to levels up to ten-fold higher than S-2P in both
HEK293F and ExpiCHO cells, yielding abundant highly pure protein. This robust expression can
facilitate production of recombinant protein vaccines. Further, more stable presentation of spike
having a structure similar to that displayed on the virion will improve activity and possibly reduce
the dose needed. Increased expression and a more stable encoded spike may also improve
mRNA or viral-vectored vaccines by allowing higher expression and better antigenic
presentation per nucleic acid molecule (Hsieh et al. 2020). These improvements could lower the
dose of nucleic acid necessary to achieve robust in vivo expression and protection, reduce cost,
lower exposure to reactogenic vaccine components, and broaden vaccine distribution.
Removing exogenous stabilizing domains prior to vaccine administration is also useful
for preventing deleterious, and potentially confounding, immune responses. In December 2020,
phase I/II clinical trials for the Australian COVID-19 vaccine, UQ-CSL V451, were halted due to
false positives on some HIV-1 serology tests that were likely associated with the inclusion of a
C-terminal "molecular clamp" derived from the HIV-1 env in the SARS-COV-2 spike (Update on
UQ COVID-19 vaccine). An alternate trimerization domain, Foldon, is also highly immunogenic
and may influence the resulting immune response (Brouwer et al. 2020; Lainšček et al. 2020).
With a 3 ˚C higher Tm, VFLIP is more thermostable than HexaPro and retains its trimeric
structure even after removal of the Foldon trimerization domain (VFLIP∆Foldon). VFLIP∆Foldon
remains trimeric after lyophilization, multiple freeze/thaw cycles, and prolonged storage at either
4 °C or at room temperature. Storage of VFLIPΔFoldon antigen in a drawer at room temperature
for over a month has no detectable effect on spike quality. In contrast, HexaPro∆Foldon is more
prone to dissociate into monomers, with dissociation exacerbated by lyophilization, multiple

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.06.441046; this version posted May 6, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

freeze/thaw cycles, or prolonged storage at room temperature or 4 °C (Figure 5A-C).
VFLIP∆Foldon also exhibits good immunogenicity in mice. Together these results suggest that
trimerization domains can be removed without substantial impact on antigenic function.
Another important goal for antigen engineering is maintenance of native posttranslational modifications, especially glycosylation, which plays a significant role in protein
folding and stability. Glycans also contribute to the antigenic landscape by occluding regions of
the protein from antibody access in addition to comprising portions of antibody epitopes (Grant
et al. 2020; Walls, Park, et al. 2020). Therefore, accurate reflection of the glycan profile on
authentic virions is critical for ensuring faithful mimicry of native antigenicity and
immunogenicity. The VFLIP spike incorporates and displays native-like glycosylation that
accurately reflects the glycan profile of the native virion (Yao et al. 2020). In both VFLIP and
authentic virus, complex glycans are present at N603 and N709 in the conserved S2 subunit,
whereas 5P and S-2P spike instead display high-mannose structures. VFLIP also has nativelike processing of RBD glycans (N331 and N343) and NTD glycans, which have been shown to
influence the conformational state of RBD (N165 and N234).
For practical utility as a vaccine or research reagent, a spike immunogen must be able to
be efficiently produced, properly folded, and natively glycosylated in cell lines appropriate for
industrial production (Blundell et al. 2020; Raska et al. 2010). ExpiCHO-S is a high-yield
mammalian culture system derived from the commonly used industrial cell line, CHO-S,
approved for Good-Manufacturing-Practice (GMP) production (He et al. 2018). The high yields
of VFLIP spike obtained from the ExpiCHO expression system in our academic laboratory
suggest that VFLIP would be amenable for large-scale industrial production. The VFLIP spike
also better reflects the glycosylation of spikes present on the native virion, whether expressed in
HEK293F or ExpiCHO cells (Yao et al. 2020).

The third-generation design of VFLIP preserves the natural RBD motion present in the
native virion. High-resolution cryo-EM demonstrates that VFLIP displays the RBDs in a
predominately “closed” conformation until interaction with the ACE2 receptor lifts the RBDs to
the “up” conformation. In contrast, other engineered spikes employing disulfide bonds have all
RBDs "locked down" and often positioned deeper than on the native virion. These structural
perturbations may potentially affect the antigenicity of these designs: immunogens that begin
with RBD “down” may better elicit those antibodies that benefit from an avidity boost and a
symmetrical presentation of epitopes for B cell receptor cross-linking. Consistent with this
possibility, an iso-affinity plot shows that CoVIC antibodies bound to a disulfide-bound “lockeddown” spike (DS2) consistently display slower on-rates and lower overall affinity compared to
VFLIP or HexaPro (Figure 4A).
For structural biology, VFLIP also enables extensive characterization of ACE2 and
those antibodies that normally disrupt the spike structure through receptor mimicry and postfusion triggering. Although methods such as brief incubation and immediate freezing have been
attempted, structures of these complexes have remained elusive due to low site occupancy and
fewer quality particles for high-resolution structural determination. In contrast, VFLIP exhibits slow

off-rates for bound ACE2 or antibodies and is not disrupted by receptor-mimicking antibodies,
thus increasing the number of high-quality particles with fully occupied epitopes and facilitating
acquisition of structures.
Finally, we sought to determine if the innovative VFLIP design can serve as an effective
immunogen for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. The need for improved vaccine candidates is
underscored by the recent emergence of variants of concern (VOC) that exhibit increased
transmissibility and reduced sensitivity to neutralization by polyclonal sera and some therapeutic
mAbs (D. Zhou et al. 2021; Planas et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2021). Lineage B.1.351 (known
informally as the South African variant), has the greatest potential for antibody escape, largely

mediated by the N501Y, E484K, and K417N substitutions in the RBD. Studies using
pseudotyped and authentic B.1.351 have demonstrated a 6-14 fold reduction in neutralization
potency of sera from COVID-19 patients or vaccinated individuals, and complete ablation of
neutralization in up to 40% of convalescent samples (Planas et al. 2021; D. Zhou et al. 2021;
Wang et al. 2021).
The high potency and cross-reactivity of VFLIP-induced sera is likely the result of the
predominant “all-down” initial conformation and increased structural stability. Specifically, the
more closed conformation of the VFLIP spike may dampen antibody responses against
immunodominant epitopes on “up” RBDs that enable viral escape, including the variable RBM
containing N501Y, E484K and K417N (Duan et al. 2020). Furthermore, the improved stability of
the VFLIP spike trimer could improve generation of neutralizing antibodies. The structural
stability of a vaccine antigen is reported to correlate with the development of highly matured
antibodies that require temporally extended germinal center reactions (Feng et al. 2016;
Karlsson Hedestam et al. 2017) (Cirelli and Crotty 2017). Stabilizing these spike proteins
permits the extended presentation of native antigen on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs)–including
conformational epitopes that are lost upon antigen degradation–while avoiding presentation of
potentially distracting, non-native or undesired epitopes such as those present on inner surfaces
that are only exposed in the monomer (Finney et al. 2018). Moreover, the resistance of VFLIP to
fusogenic triggering prevents destruction of the antigen upon ligation of receptor-mimicking
antibodies, which could extend the half-life of the antigen and, in turn, enhance generation of
potently neutralizing antibodies (El Shikh et al. 2010; Doria-Rose and Joyce 2015; McLellan et
al. 2013). In immunized BALB/c mice, VFLIP spikes elicited neutralizing titers superior to S-2P,
and offers greater stability, and quaternary epitope presentation than HexaPro. This improved
stability, and incorporation of more native glycan structures improves preservation and display
of epitopes throughout antigen trafficking in vivo. Taken together, VFLIP is a highly stable,

which can serve as an improved research tool and promising vaccine candidate for further

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS

METHOD DETAILS
Design of SARS-CoV-2 spike variants
Spike variants were initially designed using the S-2P construct that includes ectodomain
residues 13-1208 (Genbank: MN908947), two proline substitutions (K986P, V967P), and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.06.441046; this version posted May 6, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

substitution of cleavage site residues RRAR with GSAS at position 682-685 (“RRAR” to
“GSAS”). Designs containing five or six prolines were based on the HexaPro construct that
carries, in addition to the proline substitutions of S-2P, proline substitutions at positions 817,
892, 899 and 942. All variants were cloned into a PhCMV mammalian expression vector
containing a C-terminal foldon trimerization domain followed by an HRV-3C cleavage site and a
Twin-Strep-Tag. Using the published S-2P cryo-EM structure (PDB: 6VSB), truncated cleavage
site linkers of varying length and flexibility were designed to prevent S1/S2 cleavage and
improve protein expression. Candidate interprotomer disulfide bond candidates were selected
by assessing residues with CB atoms lying within 5 Å of subunit interfaces, or by visual
inspection. HexaPro P986 was reverted to lysine to restore a potential interprotomer salt-bridge
that is disrupted by this mutation (PDB: 6VXX). Combinatorial variants containing different
cleavage site linkers, proline substitutions and disulfide bonds were evaluated for effects on
purity, yield and thermostability.

Transient transfection and protein purification
SARS-CoV-2 spike variants were transiently transfected in Freestyle 293-F and
ExpiCHO-S cells (Thermo Fisher). Both cell lines were maintained and transfected according to
the manufacturer’s protocols. Briefly, 293-F cells were transfected with plasmid DNA mixed with
polyethylenimine and harvested on day 5. Cultures were clarified by centrifugation, followed by
addition of BioLock (IBA Life Sciences), passage through a 0.22 µM sterile filter, and purification
on an ӒKTA go system (Cytivia) using a 5mL StrepTrap-HP column equilibrated with TBS buffer
(25mM Tris pH 7.6, 200mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN ), and eluted in TBS buffer supplemented with
3

5mM d-desthiobiotin (Sigma Aldrich). Proteins were then purified by size-exclusionchromatography (SEC) on a Superdex 6 Increase 10/300 column (Cytivia) in the same TBS
buffer.

For all ExpiCHO cultures, the manufacturer’s “High Titer” protocol was used with a 7-day
culture incubation to assess relative expression. Briefly, plasmid DNA and Expifectamine were
mixed in Opti-PRO SFM (Gibco) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and added to the
cells. On day 1, cells were fed with manufacturer-supplied feed and enhancer as specified in the
manufacturer’s protocol, and cultures were moved to a shaker incubator set to 32 ˚C, 5% CO

2

and 115 RPM. On day 7, the cultures were clarified by centrifugation, BioLock was added, and
supernatants were passed through a 0.22 µM sterile filter. Purification was performed as above,
on an ӒKTA go system using a 5mL StrepTrap HP column and TBS buffer, followed by SEC on
a Superdex 6 Increase 10/300 column with TBS buffer.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry
Thermal stability was measured using a MicroCal VP-Capillary calorimeter (Malvern)
with 0.6 mg/ml of each sample in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer at a scanning rate of
90 °C hour from 20°C to 120°C. Data were analyzed using VP-Capillary DSC automated data
−1

analysis software.

Negative stain electron microscopy (NS-EM)
To prepare samples for NS-EM, 3 µL 0.02 mg/mL protein was applied to a carbon film
400 mesh grid for 1 minute. The grid was then washed three times with 10 µL Milli-Q water and
stained three times with 4 µL drops of 1% uranyl formate, with the first two drops briefly and the
third time for 1 minute. The grid was blotted with Whatman filter paper after each application of
liquid. Micrographs were collected on a Titan Halo transmission electron microscope, operating
with an accelerating voltage of 300kV and using a pixel size of 1.4Å/pixel.

Cryo-Electron Microscopy sample preparation
VFLIP and VFLIP_D614G were concentrated to 2mg/ml and electron microscopy grids
were prepared by placing a 3 µL aliquot of the sample on a plasma-cleaned C-flat grid (2/1C-3T,
Protochips Inc) that was then immersed in liquid ethane for vitrification. For formation of
VFLIP_D614G:HLX70 Fab and VFLIP_D614G:HLX71_ACE2-Fc complexes, the trimerization
tag ‘Foldon’ and purification tags of VFLIP_D614G spike were enzymatically removed by an
overnight treatment with HRV protease at room temperature before concentration to 1mg/ml
and incubation at a 1:2 molar ratio with HLX70 Fab or HLX71 ACE2-Fc at room temperature
overnight. The samples were then injected over a gel filtration column (Superose 6 10/30, GE
Life Sciences) equilibrated with 20mM Tris pH 8.0 and 150mM NaCl. The complex peak
fractions were concentrated to an absorbance of 2.0. Electron microscopy grids were prepared
as described above.

Cryo-EM data collection and processing
Grids were loaded into a Titan Krios G3 electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
equipped with a K3 direct electron detector (Gatan, Inc.) at the end of a BioQuantum energy
filter, using an energy slit of 20eV. The microscope was operated with an accelerating voltage of
300kV. Grids were imaged with a pixel size of 0.66 Å in counting mode. Data was acquired
using the software EPU. Motion correction, CTF estimation, and particle-picking were done with
Warp (Tegunov and Cramer 2019). Extracted particles were exported to cryoSPARC-v2
(Punjani et al. 2017) (Structura Biotechnology Inc.) for 2D classification, ab initio 3D
reconstruction, and refinement. C1 symmetry was used during homogeneous refinement.

Cryo-EM model building and analysis
A previously published structure of the SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain with all RBDs in the down
conformation (PDB ID 6X79) was used to fit the cryo-EM maps in UCSF ChimeraX (Goddard et
al. 2018) and PyMOL. Mutations were made in PyMOL. Coordinates were then fitted manually
using COOT (Emsley et al. 2010), followed by cycles of refinement using Phenix (Afonine et al.
2018) real space refinement. COOT was used for subsequent fitting.

Glycoproteomics sample preparation
Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was denatured at 95 °C at a final concentration
of 2% sodium deoxycholate (SDC), 200 mM Tris/HCl, 10 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, pH
8.0 for 10 min, followed by a 30 min reduction at 37 °C. Next, samples were alkylated by adding
40 mM iodoacetamide and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 45 min. For each
protease digestion, 3 μg recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was used. Samples were
divided in thirds for parallel digestion with gluC (Sigma)-trypsin (Promega), chymotrypsin
(Sigma) and alpha lytic protease (Sigma). For each protease digestion, 18 μL of the denatured,
reduced, and alkylated samples was diluted in a total volume of 100 μL 50 mM ammonium
bicarbonate and proteases were added at a 1:30 ratio (w:w) for incubation overnight at 37 °C.
For the gluC-trypsin digestion, gluC was added first for two hours, and then incubated with
trypsin overnight. After overnight digestion, SDC was removed by precipitation with2 μL formic
acid and centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. The resulting supernatant containing the
peptides was collected for desalting on a 30 µm Oasis HLB 96-well plate (Waters). The Oasis
HLB sorbent was activated with 100% acetonitrile and subsequently equilibrated with 10%
formic acid in water. Next, peptides were bound to the sorbent, washed twice with 10% formic
acid in water and eluted with 100 µL 50% acetonitrile/10% formic acid in water (v/v). The eluted
peptides were dried under vacuum and resuspended in 100 µL 2% formic acid in water. The
experiment was performed in duplicate.

Glycoproteomics mass spectrometry
The duplicate samples were analyzed with two different mass spectrometry methods,
using identical LC-MS parameters andt distinct fragmentation schemes. In one method,
peptides were subjected to Electron Transfer/Higher-Energy Collision Dissociation
fragmentation (Frese et al. 2012, 2013). In the other method, all precursors were subjected to
HCD fragmentation, with additional EThcD fragmentation triggered by the presence of glycan
reporter oxonium ions. For each duplicate sample injection, approximately 0.15 μg of peptides
were run on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen)
coupled to a Dionex UltiMate 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A 90-min LC gradient from 0% to
44% acetonitrile was used to separate peptides at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Peptides were
separated using a Poroshell 120 EC-C18 2.7-Micron analytical column (ZORBAX
Chromatographic Packing, Agilent) and a C18 PepMap 100 trap column (5 mm x 300 µm, 5 µm,
Thermo Fisher Scientific). Data was acquired in data-dependent mode. Orbitrap Fusion
parameters for the full scan MS spectra were as follows: a standard AGC target at 60 000
resolution, scan range 350-2000 m/z, Orbitrap maximum injection time 50 ms. The ten most
intense ions (2+ to 8+ ions) were subjected to fragmentation. For the EThcD fragmentation
scheme, the supplemental higher energy collision dissociation energy was set at 27%. MS2
spectra were acquired at a resolution of 30,000 with an AGC target of 800%, maximum injection
time 250 ms, scan range 120-4000 m/z and dynamic exclusion of 16 s. For the triggered HCDEThcD method, the LC gradient and MS1 scan parameters were identical. The ten most intense
ions (2+ to 8+) were subjected to HCD fragmentation with 30% normalized collision energy from
120-4000 m/z at 30,000 resolution with an AGC target of 100% and a dynamic exclusion
window of 16 s. Scans containing any of the following oxonium ions within 20 ppm were
followed up with additional EThcD fragmentation with 27% supplemental HCD fragmentation.
The triggering reporter ions were: Hex(1) (129.039; 145.0495; 163.0601), PHex(1) (243.0264;

405.0793), HexNAc(1) (138.055; 168.0655; 186.0761), Neu5Ac(1) (274.0921; 292.1027),
Hex(1)HexNAc(1) (366.1395), HexNAc(2) (407.166), dHex(1)Hex(1)HexNAc(1) (512.1974), and
Hex(1)HexNAc(1)Neu5Ac(1) (657.2349). EThcD spectra were acquired at a resolution of 30,000
with a normalized AGC target of 400%, maximum injection time 250 ms, and scan range 1204000 m/z.

Mass spectrometry data analysis
The acquired data was analyzed using Byonic (v3.11.1) against a custom database of
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences and the proteases used in the experiment to search for
glycan modifications with 12/24 ppm search windows for MS1 and MS2, respectively. Up to five
missed cleavages were permitted using C-terminal cleavage at R/K/E/D for gluC-trypsin or
F/Y/W/M/L for chymotrypsin. Up to 8 missed cleavages were permitted using C-terminal
cleavage at T/A/S/V for alpha lytic protease. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a
fixed modification and oxidation of methionine/tryptophan was set as variable rare 1. N-glycan
modifications were set as variable common 2, allowing up to a maximum of 3 variable common
and 1 rare modification per peptide. All N-linked glycan databases from Byonic were merged
into a single non-redundant list for inclusion in the database search. All reported glycopeptides
in the Byonic result files were first filtered for score ≥ 100 and PEP2D ≤ 0.01, then manually
inspected for quality of fragment assignments. All glycopeptide identifications were merged into
a single non-redundant list per sequon. Glycans were classified based on HexNAc and Hexose
content as paucimannose (2 HexNAc, 3 Hex), high-mannose (2 HexNAc; > 3 Hex), hybrid (3
HexNAc) or complex (> 3 HexNAc). Byonic search results were exported into mzIdentML format
to build a spectral library in Skyline (v20.1.0.31) and to extract peak areas for individual
glycoforms from MS1 scans. N-linked glycan modifications identified from Byonic were manually
added to the Skyline project file in XML format. Reported peak areas were pooled based on the

number of HexNAc, Fuc or NeuAc residues to distinguish paucimannose, high-mannose, hybrid,
and complex glycosylation.

CoVIC antibodies
Eukaryotic expression vectors containing the DNA sequence of HLX70 and HLX71 were
used to stably transfect CHO cells. Clinical-grade recombinant human antibodies produced from
CHO cells by Shanghai Henlius Biotech, Inc. according to Good Manufacturing Practice
guidelines and formulated as a preservative-free lyophilized powder.

High-throughput surface plasmon resonance
High-throughput SPR capture kinetic experiments were performed on an LSA biosensor
system equipped with a planar carboxymethyldextran CMDP sensor chip (Carterra). The LSA
automates the choreography between two microfluidic modules, namely a single flow cell (SFC),
which flows samples over the entire array surface and a 96-channel printhead (96PH) used to
create arrays of up 384 samples. The capture surface was prepared using the SFC by standard
amine-coupling of goat anti-human IgG Fc (Southern Biotech) to create a uniform surface, or
lawn, over the entire chip. The system running buffer was 1X HBSTE (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4,
150 mM NaCl, 3mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween-20). The chip was activated with a 10-minute
injection of freshly prepared 1:1:1 (v/v/v) 0.4M EDC 0.1MN-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (SNHS)
with 0.1M 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) pH 5.5 before coupling of goat antihuman IgG Fc (50 μg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5) for 15 minutes. Excess reactive
esters were blocked with a 7-minute injection of 1M ethanolamine HCl pH 8.5. Final coupled
levels (mean ± Std.Dev. RU across all 384 array regions of interest (ROIs) were 535 ± 32RU.
After preparing the capture surface, the instrument was primed using assay running buffer
(HBSTE with 0.5 mg/mL BSA). The Fc-ligands and mAbs were diluted into assay running buffer
and captured onto the array using the 96PH for 15 minutes at three dilutions of 25, 3.6, and 0.9.

Antibodies were captured and buffer blanks were then injected followed by a titration series of
increasing antigen concentration. RBD and spike proteins were injected at 0.8, 2.5, 7.4, 22, 67,
and 200 nM for 5 minutes with a 15-minute dissociation. After each antigen titration series the
surface was regenerated with three, 60-second pulses of 0.475% H PO . Binding data from the
3

local reference spots (interspots, representing the unoccupied capture surface) were subtracted
from the active ROIs and the nearest buffer blank analyte responses were subtracted to doublereference the data. The double-referenced data were fit globally to a simple 1:1 Langmuir
binding model using the Carterra Kinetics software tool to provide ka, kd, and Rmax values for
each spot.

Biophysical experiments and spike-splitting tests of VFLIPΔFoldon
Enzymatic removal of the ‘Foldon’ trimerization tag from VFLIP and HexaPro was
facilitated by cloning the HRV-C3 cleavage site followed by Strep purification tags between the
C terminus of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and the Foldon. After purification on a StrepTrap HP
column, proteins were incubated overnight at room temperature with 2U HRV-3C protease per
100 μg protein at room temperature. The cleaved proteins were then SEC purified. For
biophysical characterization, 150 μg of each protein was incubated at 4 ˚C and 37 ˚C for 5 days
and then SEC purified. The same amount of protein was subjected to 10 cycles of fast
freeze/thaw and then SEC purified. For lyophilization, 150 μg Foldon-free spike was dehydrated
overnight using a SpeedVac RT and the lyophilized proteins were resuspended 5 days later in
TBS before SEC purification.
To form immune complexes between shACE2 and B6 Fab fragments, and offer the greatest
chance for spike separation as we observed for these molecules with other forms of spike, we
incubated complexes for 2 days at 4˚C at a 1:2 molar ratio with Foldon-free proteins
concentrated to 1 mg/ml. Samples were purified by SEC as described above.

Mice immunization
For mouse immunization and serum extraction Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) guidelines were followed with animal subjects tested in the immunogenicity
study. Six-week-old BALB/c mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. The mice were
housed in ventilated cages in environmentally controlled rooms at the LJI animal facility, in
compliance with an approved IACUC protocol and AAALAC (Association for Assessment and
Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care) International guidelines. At week 0, each mouse was
immunized with 25 µg of the indicated antigen in 50 µl PBS together 25 μl of the Magic Mouse
CpG adjuvant (Creative technologies) and 25 μl aluminum hydroxide (Invivogen) administered
by an intramuscular (i.m.) route. At week 4, the animals were boosted with the same
antigen/adjuvant composition as used for the prime. At week 6, the animals were bled through
the retro-orbital membrane using fractionator tubes. Sera were heat inactivated at 56 °C for 1
hour and stored at -80 °C until analysis.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
96-well EIA/RIA plates (Corning, Sigma) were coated with 0.1 μg per well of HexaPro in
PBS and incubated at 4 °C overnight. On the following day, the coating solution was removed
and wells were blocked with 5% skim milk diluted in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST) at room
temperature for 1 h. Mouse serum samples that had been previously heat inactivated at 56 °C
for 1 h were diluted 1:50 and the serially diluted five-fold in 5% skim milk in PBST. The blocking
solution was removed and 50 μl of the diluted sera was added to the plates and incubated for
1 h at room temperature. Following incubation, the diluted sera were removed and the plates
were washed 4 times with PBST. Goat anti-human IgG secondary antibody-peroxidase (Fcspecific, Sigma) diluted 1:3,000 in 5% skim milk in PBST was then added and the plates were
incubated for 1 h at room temperature before washing four times with PBST. The ELISA was

50% maximum signal (EC50) against HexaPro was determined using nonlinear regression
analysis in Prism 8 version 8.4.2 (GraphPad).

rVSV SARS2 pseudovirus neutralization assay
Recombinant SARS-CoV-2-pseudotyped VSV-ΔG-GFP was generated by transfecting
293T cells with phCMV3-SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike carrying the D614G mutation and
deletion of the 19 C-terminal amino acid using TransIT according to the manufacturer's
instructions. At 24 hr post-transfection, cells were washed 2x with OptiMEM and then infected
with rVSV-G pseudotyped ΔG-GFP parent virus (VSV-G*ΔG-GFP) at MOI = 2 for 2 hours with
rocking. The virus was then removed, and the cells were washed twice with OPTI-MEM
containing 2% FBS (OPTI-2) before addition of fresh OPTI-2. Supernatants containing rVSVSARS-2 pseudoviruses were removed 24 hours post-infection and clarified by centrifugation,
pooled and stored at -80 ˚C until use.
SARS-CoV-2-pseudotyped VSV-ΔG-GFP was next titered in Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81). Cells
were seeded in 96-well plates at a sufficient density to form a monolayer at the time of infection.
10-fold serial dilutions of pseudovirus were made and added to cells in triplicate wells. Infection
was allowed to proceed for 16-18 hr at 37 ˚C before fixation of the cells with 4% PFA and
staining with Hoechst (10 µg/mL) in PBS. Fixative/stain was replaced with PBS and pseudovirus
titers were quantified as the number of GFP-positive cells (fluorescent forming units, ffu/mL)
using a CellInsight CX5 imager (Thermo Scientific) and automated enumeration of cells
expressing GFP.
Mouse sera neutralization assays were performed with pre-titrated amounts of rVSV-SARSCoV-2 pseudovirus with sera samples diluted 1:100 and serial four-fold dilutions. The

pseudovirus and sera samples were incubated together at 37 °C for 1 hr before addition to
confluent Vero monolayers in 96-well plates. The plates were incubated for 16-18 hrs at 37 °C in
5% CO2, and then the cells were fixed with4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 10 µg/mL
Hoechst. Cells were imaged using a CellInsight CX5 imager and infection was quantified by
automated enumeration of total cells and those expressing GFP. Infection was normalized to
the average number of cells infected with rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 incubated without sera, and
pooled sera from untreated mice was used as control. Data are presented as neutralization
IC50 titers calculated using “One-Site Fit LogIC50” regression in GraphPad Prism 9.0.

Plaque reduction neutralization (PRNT) assay
SARS-CoV-2 variant D614G was obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: SARSRelated Coronavirus 2, Isolate Germany/BavPat1/2020, NR-52370. SARS-CoV-2 strain B1.351
was obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: SARS-Related Coronavirus 2, Isolate hCoV19/South Africa/KRISP-K005325/2020, NR-54009. Both SARS-CoV-2 D614G and B1.351 were
propagated in Vero-CCL81 cells, titrated by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells, deep-sequenced by
the La Jolla Institute for Immunology Sequencing Core. Assays were performed in the BSL3
facility at La Jolla Institute for Immunology. For PRNT assay, mouse serum was serial 5-fold
diluted, starting from 50-fold to 156250-fold, before co-culture with 30-40 plaque forming units
(PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 D614G or B1.351 for 1 h at 37 °C. The serum/virus mixture was then
transferred onto Vero E6 cells (8 x 104 cells/well, 24-well plate) for 2 h at 37 °C. The inoculum
was removed before overlaid with 1% carboxymethylcellulose medium to each well. All the
conditions were tested in duplication. After 3 days cultivation, cells were fixed with 10 %
formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at RT prior stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution for 20 min
at RT. Serum titer (NT50) was determined as the highest sample dilution that neutralize 50% of
virus plaques.
