Abstract
Bats are increasingly studied as model systems for longevity and as natural hosts for some
virulent viruses. Yet our ability to characterize immune mechanisms of viral tolerance and to
quantify infection dynamics in wild bats is often limited by small sample volumes and few
species-specific reagents. Here, we demonstrate how proteomics can overcome these limitations
by using data-independent acquisition-based shotgun proteomics to survey the serum proteome
of 17 vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) from Belize. Using just 2 μL of sample and relatively
short separations of undepleted serum digests, we identified 361 proteins across five orders of
magnitude. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD022885. Levels of
immunological proteins in vampire bat serum were then compared to human plasma via
published databases. Of particular interest were anti-viral and anti-bacterial components,
circulating 20S proteasome complex, and proteins involved in redox activity; whether any results
are specific to vampire bats could be assessed by future pan-mammalian analyses. Lastly, we
used known virus proteomes to identify Rh186 from Macacine herpesvirus 3 and ORF1a from
Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, indicating that mass spectrometry-based
techniques show promise for pathogen detection. Overall, these results can be used to design
targeted mass-spectrometry assays to quantify immunological markers and detect pathogens.
More broadly, our findings also highlight the application of proteomics in advancing wildlife
immunology and pathogen surveillance.

Introduction
Bats are a hyper-diverse and geographically widespread order (Chiroptera), accounting for over
20 % of all mammal species1. Owing to their capacity for flight and wide range of trophic habits
(e.g., frugivory, nectarivory, insectivory, carnivory, sanguivory), bats provide critical ecosystem
services that include seed dispersal, pollination, and predation of insects 2. Unique features of
bats among mammals, such as the capacity for powered flight and long lifespans despite small
body sizes, also make this order interesting for basic research in ecology and evolution 3,4.
Recently, bats have also become model systems for studies of the microbiome and sociality5,6.
However, because some bats are common in anthropogenic landscapes, they are
increasingly studied for their ability to harbor pathogens with high virulence in humans and
domestic animals 7,8. In particular, bats carry more zoonotic viruses than most other mammalian
orders 9, and they are the confirmed reservoir hosts for Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Marburg virus,
an array of lyssaviruses (e.g., rabies virus), and SARS-like coronaviruses 10–13. Spillovers of
these sometimes lethal viruses, from bats to humans, are often driven by ecological changes that
alter infectious disease dynamics in wild bat populations and change interactions between bats
and recipient hosts 14,15. However, with some exceptions (e.g., lyssaviruses), these viruses may
not typically cause clinical disease in bats 16. Although the high richness of zoonotic viruses in
bats may simply be a function of their vast species diversity 17, tolerance to virulent viruses is
likely driven by distinct aspects of immunity in these flying mammals, including robust
complement, constitutive expression of type I interferons (e.g., IFN-α), and high combinatorial
diversity in immunoglobulin genes 4,18–20. Accordingly, contemporary studies of zoonotic
pathogens in bats have focused on characterizing immunological factors that facilitate tolerance

or shedding of viruses, quantifying viral diversity, and identifying spatial and temporal pulses of
infection 21–23.
Traditionally, efforts to assess the immunological state of wild bats and detect viruses
have relied on relatively simple tools. Most bat species are sufficiently small that only modest
volumes of blood can be safely collected under non-lethal procedures 24; 74% of bat species
weigh less than 30 grams as adults 25. Small blood volumes and lack of species-specific reagents
for bats generally restrict the scope of possible immune assays 26,27. Remote field sites also pose
significant challenges for sample storage and transport at ideal temperatures. Despite these
obstacles, techniques such as in vitro microbial killing assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assays, and in vivo antigen challenge have helped to broadly characterize complement, antibody,
and cellular immune response in wild bats and how these phenotypes vary with life history (e.g.,
reproduction) and environmental conditions 28–30. Similarly, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
has formed the primary basis of virus detection 31. However, because bat colonies can be large
(e.g., hundreds to over 20 million individuals 32) and prevalence of active viral infection is
generally low, serology and the detection of virus-specific antibodies has also commonly been
employed 33. Although serological surveys have been important for characterizing virus
circulation in bats, antibody cross-reactivity and inconsistent cut-off thresholds can limit their
interpretability 34.
Given these restrictions, studies of bat immunology and virology have increasingly
benefitted from modern bioanalytical approaches. Researchers employing global profiling
techniques, such as RNA-Seq-based transcriptomics, have begun to contribute new resources for
bat immunology and to illuminate the broad immune response of bats to viral infections 35,36.
Similarly, metagenomic approaches have helped reduce bias in broad characterization of bat

viral diversity 37,38. In addition to these approaches, proteomics can provide a complementary
modality to define the molecular landscape. Proteomics is uniquely useful when applied to
blood, because the blood proteome is mostly secreted from organs such as the liver 39, thereby
permitting interrogation of the circulating protein phenotype beyond cellular transcript profiling.
Using the relatively small sample volumes that typify bat field studies (e.g., < 10 μL), proteomic
analysis of blood can identify and relatively-quantify hundreds of proteins, including but not
limited to those involved in host response to infection and other useful immunological
biomarkers 40. Prior applications of serum proteomics in bats have described proteins involved in
shifts in innate immunity and blood coagulation between hibernating and active greater mouseeared bats (Myotis myotis) 41 as well as between North American and European Myotis species
that vary in infection with Pseudogymnoascus destructans, which causes white-nose syndrome
42

. Proteomic applications to other bat tissues, such as saliva, brain, and lung, have identified

possible immunomodulatory properties in vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) 43, neuronal
differences between active and torpid horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) 44, and
upregulation of cell-mediated immunity in flying foxes (Pteropus alecto) compared with ferrets
infected with Hendra virus 45. Given the general utility of proteomic analysis, we expected a
survey of the vampire bat serum proteome should provide complementary information to
existing approaches, while also providing a more complete survey of the underlying molecular
landscape.
Here, we used data-independent acquisition-based shotgun proteomics (i.e., bottom-up
proteomics) to profile the undepleted serum proteome of 17 bats from two locations. We focused
this work on vampire bats, a species that has an obligate diet of blood and feeds on prey as
diverse as sea lions, tapirs, livestock, and humans 46–48, providing vast opportunities for

transmission of viruses (e.g., rabies virus, adenovirus, herpesvirus) to and from these prey 49–51.
Our results demonstrate the feasibility and capabilities of serum proteomic analyses in wild bats,
including possibilities to simultaneously detect immunological components and viruses as well
as to establish preliminary ranges of vampire bat proteins for comparison with other mammals.

Methods
Vampire bat sampling
As part of an ongoing longitudinal study, vampire bats were sampled in 2015 at two adjacent
localities in the Orange Walk District of Belize: Lamanai Archeological Reserve (LAR, 450
hectares) and Ka’Kabish (KK, 45 hectares). These sites are located in a highly agricultural
mosaic landscape where deforestation has been driven by cropland expansion in the 1990s
followed by heightened demand for livestock pasture in the 2000s 52. These land-use changes
have fragmented previously intact forest and have provided vampire bats with an abundant prey
in the form of livestock 29. In recent years (2016 onward), rabies outbreaks in domestic animals
have increased across Belize and in Orange Walk District, and virus isolates from livestock have
been characterized as vampire bat–associated variants 53. Although we are unaware of other viral
detection efforts in vampire bats in Belize, this species has tested positive elsewhere in Central
and South America for adenoviruses, coronaviruses, flaviviruses, hantaviruses, herpesviruses,
and paramyxoviruses, as well as for antibodies against henipavirus-like viruses 51,54–62.
Vampire bats were captured with mist nets and harp traps set along trails and adjacent to
known roost sites. All individuals were issued a unique incoloy wing band (3.5 mm, Porzana
Inc.) and identified by sex, age, and reproductive status 63. Serum was obtained by lancing the
propatagial vein with a 23-gauge needle to collect blood and centrifuging resulting samples in

serum separator tubes followed by short-term freezing at –20 °C until long-term –80 °C storage.
Bleeding was stopped with styptic gel, and all bats were released at their capture location. Field
protocols followed guidelines for safe and humane handling of bats issued by the American
Society of Mammalogists 24 and were approved by the University of Georgia Animal Care and
Use Committee (A2014 04-016-Y3-A5). Bat sampling was authorized by the Belize Forest
Department under permit number CD/60/3/15(21). Specimen use for proteomic analysis was
approved by the NIST Animal Care and Use Coordinator (NIST ACUC) under approval MMLAR19-0018. We included 17 serum samples for proteomic analysis, from 11 bats sampled at
LAR (10 males, one female) and six bats sampled at KK (five males, one female). This
information and the experimental key can be found in Supplemental Table S1.

Sample processing and digestion
Prior to analysis, the sample set was randomized and assigned an experimental key to avoid bias
and minimize batch effects. The 17 serum samples were thawed then centrifuged at 13 000 x gn
for 8 min at 4 °C. The S-Trap method was used for digestion with the S-Trap micro column
(ProtiFi; ≤ 100 μg binding capacity), and the specific method is described below. Based on prior
work with other mammalian sera, we assumed a protein concentration of approximately 50
μg/μL (this value can vary but assuming at least 50 μg/μLwas used for estimating enzyme for the
digest). Therefore, 2 μL (approximately 100 μg protein) of each sample was mixed with 48 μL
50 mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate and 50 μL of 2x lysis buffer (ProtiFi), then added onto the STrap. Additionally, since the samples were digested in two sets, each set included a 2 μL aliquot
of NIST SRM 909c Frozen Human Serum, which is technically a converted plasma pool. This
sample was used to qualitatively confirm digestion, LC-MS/MS performance, and downstream

search methods. All samples were reduced with 10 μL of 90 mmol/L DL-Dithiothreitol (DTT;
final concentration of 10 mmol/L) at 60 °C for 30 min, then cooled and alkylated with 10 μL of
200 mmol/L 2-chloroacetamide (CAA; final concentration of 20 mmol/L) at room temperature in
the dark for 30 min. The sample was acidified with 12 μL of 12 % phosphoric acid (volume
fraction) bringing the final volumetric ratio to 1:10. Next, 700 μL binding buffer [ProtiFi; 5 %
triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) volume fraction in methanol] was added (approximately
1:7 volumetric ratio). Using a vacuum manifold, the sample was washed across the S-Trap with
six sequential washes of 400 μL binding buffer. Next, 3 μL of 1 μg/μL trypsin (Pierce) was
mixed with 122 μL, 50 mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate, and this 125 μL solution was added to
each S-Trap, yielding approximately a 1:30 mass ratio (trypsin:total protein). Samples were
incubated at 47 °C for 1 h, after which they were sequentially washed into 1.5 mL Lo-Bind
microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf) by centrifugation with the following wash steps: 80 μL 50
mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate, 80 μL 0.2 % formic acid (volume fraction), 80 μL 0.2 % formic
acid in 50 % acetonitrile (volume fractions) at 1000 x gn, 1000 x gn, and 4000 x gn, respectively
at 4 °C for 1 min. The resulting peptide mixtures were reduced to dryness in a vacuum centrifuge
at low heat and stored at -80 °C. Prior to analysis samples were reconstituted with 100 μL 0.1 %
formic acid (volume fraction) and briefly vortexed, then centrifuged 10 000 x gn for 10 min at 4
°C. The peptide concentration of each sample was determined using the Pierce quantitative
fluorometric peptide assay with a BioTek Synergy HT plate reader.

LC-MS/MS
Peptide mixtures in 0.1% formic acid (volume fraction) were analyzed using an UltiMate 3000
Nano LC coupled to a Fusion Lumos Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Using the original sample randomization yielded a randomized sample order and injection
volumes were determined for 0.5 μg loading (between 0.37 and 0.95 μL sample). One sample
from bat D141 (experimental key Bat_20) was used as a technical replicate to evaluate technical
variability across the run (Supplemental Figure S1), while the two aforementioned human serum
pools were analyzed in the same manner as the bat sera. Peptide mixtures were loaded onto a
PepMap 100 C18 trap column (75 µm id x 2 cm length; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 3 µL/min
for 10 min with 2 % acetonitrile (volume fraction) and 0.05 % trifluoroacetic acid (volume
fraction) followed by separation on an Acclaim PepMap RSLC 2 µm C18 column (75µm id x 25
cm length; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 40 °C. Peptides were separated along a 60 min two-step
gradient of 5 % to 30 % mobile phase B (80 % acetonitrile volume fraction, 0.08 % formic acid
volume fraction) over 50 min followed by a ramp to 45 % mobile phase B over 10 min and lastly
ramped to 95% mobile phase B over 5 min, and held at 95 % mobile phase B for 5 min, all at a
flow rate of 300 nL/min.
The Fusion Lumos was operated in positive polarity with a data-independent acquisition
(DIA) method constructed using the targetedMS2 module (as opposed to the built-in DIA
module). The full scan resolution using the orbitrap was set at 120 000, the mass range was 399
to 1200 m/z (corresponding to the DIA windows used), 30 % RF lens was set, the full scan ion
target value was 4.0e5 allowing a maximum injection time of 20 ms. A default charge of 4 was
set under MS Global Settings. As stated, DIA windows were constructed using the targetedMS2
module. Each window used higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) at a normalized
collision energy of 32 with quadrupole isolation width at 21 m/z. The fragment scan resolution
using the orbitrap was set at 30 000, the scan range was specified as 200 to 2000 m/z, ion target
value of 1.0e6 and 60 ms maximum injection time. Data were collected as profile data in both

MS1 and MS2, though the authors wish to note that using centroid data is possible for most DIA
software. The DIA window scheme was an overlapping static window strategy such that each of
the 40 windows were 21 m/z wide, with 1 m/z overlap on each side covering the range of 399 to
1200 m/z. The window centers were specified in the mass list table (with z = 2), such that they
were 409.5, 429.5, 449.5, ..., 1189.5. The method file (85min_DIA_40x21mz.meth) is also
included in the PRIDE submission. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited
to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE 64 partner repository with the dataset
identifier PXD022885.

DIA search parameters
Analysis was performed using Spectronaut (v13.6.190905.43655). The following settings were
used. Sequences: Trypsin selected, max pep length 52, min pep length 7, two missed cleavages,
KR as special amino acids in decoy generation, toggle N-terminal M set to true. Labelling: no
labelling settings were used. Applied modifications: maximum of five variable modifications
using fixed carbamidomethyl (C), and variable acetyl (protein N-term) and oxidation (M).
Identification: per run machine learning, Q-value cut-off of 0.01 for precursors and proteins,
single hits defined by stripped sequence, and do not exclude single hit proteins, PTM localization
set to true with a probability cut-off of 0.75, kernel density p-value estimator. Quantification:
interference correction was used with excluding all multi-channel interferences with minimum of
2 and 3 for MS1 and MS2, respectively, proteotypicity filter set to none, major protein grouping
by protein group ID, minor peptide grouping by stripped sequence, major group quantity set to
mean peptide quantity, a Major Group Top N was used (min of 1, max of 3), minor group
quantity set to mean precursor quantity, a Minor Group Top N was used (min1, max of 3),

quantity MS-level used MS2 area, data filtering by q-value, cross run normalization was used
with global median normalization and automatic row selection, no modifications or amino acids
were specified, best N fragments per peptide was set to between 3 and 6, with ion charge and
type not used. Workflow: no workflow was used. Post Analysis: no calculated explained TIC or
sample correlation matrix, differential abundance grouping using major group (from
quantification settings) and smallest quantitative unit defined by precursor ion (from
quantification settings), differential abundance was not used for conclusions. The fasta file used
for searching bat samples was the NCBI RefSeq Desmodus rotundus Release 100,
GCF_002940915.1_ASM294091v2 (29 845 sequences), and for searching human samples was
the 2020_01 release of the UniProtKB SwissProt with isoforms, using the taxonomy term 9606
(Homo sapiens; 42 385 sequences). For the host plus virus searching, these same fasta files were
used along with a fasta of D. rotundus–associated virus sequences retrieved from the DBatVir
database (156 sequences; downloaded 12 November 2020 62) and the following six fasta
retrieved from the 2020_05 release of the UniProtKB SwissProt and TrEMBL: Adenoviridae
(taxon ID: 10508; 30 051 sequences), Betacoronavirus (taxon ID: 694002; 21 892 sequences),
Henipavirus (taxon ID: 260964; 462 sequences), Herpesvirales (taxon ID: 548681; 88 353
sequences), Morbillivirus (taxon ID: 11229; 23 142 sequences), and Rabies lyssavirus (taxon ID:
11292; 23 398 sequences). All fasta and Spectronaut .snes files (the human and bat data are
searched with and without all virus databases) are included in PRIDE submission PXD022885.

Ortholog mapping, gene ontology term sorting, and rank comparisons
Following DIA identification, there were 376 RefSeq vampire bat protein identifiers with MS2based quantities across the experiment (Supplemental Table S2). These identifications were

converted to human orthologs to aid in downstream analysis and for comparison to other studies.
This was accomplished by using a series of python scripts (Anaconda v2019.07; conda v4.7.11;
Python v3.6.8) from Github on the following two repositories: pwilmart/PAW_BLAST and
pwilmart/annotations, retrieved November 18, 2019. Broadly, these tools take a list of identifiers
to create a subset fasta (make_subset_DB_from_list_3.py), which is then searched against a
human fasta (db_to_db_blaster.py) using a local installation of BLAST+ 2.9.0 65. The results
were further annotated using add_uniprot_annotations.py. The 376 vampire bat proteins were
assigned human orthologs, which were then manually inspected for incorrect assignments. Such
assignments can happen when a protein is not present in humans (e.g., beta-lactoglobulin 1 or
inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase), or if the blast hit disagrees with the original annotation, in
which case the original annotation is preserved (e.g., apolipoprotein R was matched to C4bbinding protein alpha chain). Finally, duplicate entries were summed together into a single nonredundant entry. An intermediate table (Supplemental Table S2) is given that delineates which
entries had manually assigned gene names, or were duplicates to be summed. The resulting table
included mapped orthologs with UniProtKB links (Supplemental Table S3). Gene ontology (GO)
term sorting was performed by using GO search terms in UniProtKB along with the human taxon
identifier (9606), yielding a list of human gene symbols that was used to subset the vampire bat
results. Specifically in Supplemental Table S3, the complement activation Gene Ontology (GO)
term (GO:0006956) was used to identify 31 bat proteins. In addition to vampire bat proteome,
identifications and relative abundances of the control pooled human serum can be found in
Supplemental Table S4, but were not used for comparison.
The serum proteome of the vampire bat was compared to the plasma proteome of the
human described on the Human Blood Atlas by using values from Table 1 "Protein detected in

human plasma by mass spectrometry" from the Human Blood Atlas website
(https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/blood/proteins+detected+in+ms; accessed 15 June
2020). This table was combined with the relative abundance and resulting ranks of the 361
proteins identified (Supplemental Table S5). The rank of the shared 323 proteins was compared
by determining the absolute difference in rank divided by the minimum rank, referred to as
“Rank Delta”. An arbitrary cut-off of 3 was chosen, but the complete list was still manually
inspected for proteins of interest. Only proteins that were exceptionally elevated (or closely
related to those that were elevated) in the vampire bat serum proteome were considered. Some
proteins like PRDX1 (136th in bat and 432 in human) were less than 3 in their rank delta, but
were still considered of interest. This final list of proteins of interest can be found in
Supplemental Table S6, along with links to both UniProt and Human Blood Atlas entries.

Results and Discussion
Studying the interactions between hosts and pathogens is important to understand infectious
disease risks, yet such research is hampered by our poor knowledge of the underlying
biochemical landscape for most host species. Bats offer a unique opportunity to investigate how
immunological components may confer the ability to harbor virulent viruses, a topic of
considerable interest particularly in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Because
complement plays a key role in innate immunity and functions as a bridge between innate and
adaptive responses 66–68, prior studies have mostly used microbicidal assays using pathogens
with complement-dependent killing to profile levels of these proteins in bats, demonstrating
individual and environmental sources of variation 28–30,69,70 . We profiled the serum proteome of

vampire bats as a first step at broadly describing the bat serum proteome. This inventory allowed
investigating not only complement proteins, but also a global investigation of the bat serum
proteome, including other components of the innate immune response, as well as detection of
viral proteins, and can serve as a resource to develop targeted mass spectrometry-based assays.
Blood is a unique biofluid that is proximal to most organs, containing cells and secreted
proteins. The considerable dynamic range of proteins in serum and plasma has been frequently
described in humans, spanning at least eight orders of magnitude, though approximately 10
proteins account for 90 % of the plasma proteome 39,71. Similarly, we unsurprisingly found the
vampire bat serum proteome encompassed a dynamic range of five orders of magnitude (Figure
1A). The top four proteins (albumin, immunoglobulin lambda-1 light chain, hemoglobin subunit
beta, and alpha-1-antitrypsin) accounted for 50% of the total abundance estimated using DIA.
Ranges for the top 20 proteins (based on average abundance; Figure 1B) were determined using
protein abundance from the 17 individuals. Despite the difficulties in making direct comparisons
between the vampire bat serum proteome and that of other mammals, it is possible to specifically
evaluate complement components in bat serum. The complement activation Gene Ontology (GO)
term (GO:0006956), which includes the lectin pathway, was used to highlight relative levels of
31 proteins in bat serum (Figure 1C) and indicate their rank and abundance in the serum
proteome (Figure 1A). Apolipoprotein R and manose-binding protein A were added since they
are not present in humans but are likely involved in complement activation. It would be
interesting to infer that these complement protein levels are higher in bats than other mammals,
but without adequate reference ranges, and given the technical artifacts of serum preparation
across species, these comparisons are currently difficult at best and an avenue for future
comparative study.

MBL1 and APOR is to indicate that these are not human proteins but likely involved in
complement activation.

Although blood has been extensively studied in humans, it is surprisingly difficult to
compare mass spectrometry-based analysis between human studies, much less between different
species. The current study used a pooled human converted plasma sample (Supplemental Table
S4) to enable this comparison. Additionally, the Human Blood Atlas 72 was used as a reference
(Supplemental Table 5), with reported approximate concentrations of over 3000 proteins
detected by mass spectrometry in human plasma. For an exploratory analysis, using these two
datasets is acceptable, but two key caveats should be acknowledged. First, ranges of human
concentrations are needed, which is obscured in a pooled sample as well as in the current Human
Blood Atlas. Second, the wild bat samples may have had technical artifacts (e.g., hemolysis),
which is evident by the high levels of hemoglobin subunit beta likely resulting from ruptured red
blood cells 73 (Figure 1B). Ongoing efforts by our group and others will continue to define the
serum and plasma proteome in humans and other species, and we expect more population-level
data with protein abundance ranges to become available and more easily comparable across
mammals.
Despite these caveats, we can highlight certain proteins that are higher in bat serum than
in humans, without an obvious technical artifactual explanation. These were identified using the
ranks of proteins in the parallel analyzed human pool and those available on the Human Blood
Atlas versus the ranks of proteins in the vampire bat dataset (Figure 2; Supplemental Table S5).
Broadly, these proteins fall into four general categories: innate immunity, circulating

Innate immunity
Investigation of apparent differences in proteins related to innate immunity is important because
vampire bats harbor diverse pathogens 22,51,54–56,74 and because bats more generally appear to
tolerate some viral infections without showing disease 4,8,20,23. In addition to the complement
proteins described above, we identified notable proteins related to the innate immune system that
are highly ranked in bat serum (Figure 2C). Given that some bats can constitutively express
interferons (e.g., IFN-α in Pteropus alecto) 18, it was not surprising to detect interferon-inducible
proteins (e.g., guanylate-binding proteins GBP2, GBP6, and GBP7). Of note is that IFN-α and
IFN-γ induce many similar proteins in a highly dynamic manner 75. Specific to detected
guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs), GBP2 was detected and shares antiviral properties with
GBP5 (undetected), although circulating blood GBPs do not appear common in humans 76–78. It
would be interesting to determine if certain proteins are stratified into exosomes, similar to the
IFN-induced antiviral proteome contained in macrophage-derived exosomes 79. There were also
proteins identified related to antiviral and antibacterial activity, notably relatively-high levels of
CAMP (cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide). Finally, two scavenging proteins reported in human
blood were ranked higher in bat serum: SFTPD (pulmonary surfactant-associated protein D) and
DMBT1 (deleted in malignant brain tumors 1 protein). Though their functions are related,
DMBT1 specifically binds viral and bacterial antigens 80,81 and can reduce viral infectivity 82.
The question remains whether these proteins confer a unique ability to keep pathogen virulence

at bay or if these elevated protein levels instead indicate an active infection. Ongoing studies will
continue to define the host-pathogen relationship in species such as the vampire bat.

Circulating proteasome
In addition to focusing on classically immunological proteins, we observed 14 proteasome
subunits (Figure 2D). Specifically, 13 of the 14 known 20S subunits (though missing PSMB7)
were observed along with one 26S component (PSMD2), indicating the presence of the
circulating 20S proteasome 83,84. The lack of PSMB7 may be species-specific, similar to lower
PSMB7 values reported across different mammal species 85. Although circulating 20S
proteasome is lower ranked in the Human Blood Atlas, it has been detected in human plasma,
possibly within exosomes 86. Given that our group has observed similarly abundant 20S
proteasome subunits in other mammalian serum and plasma (e.g., California sea lion plasma
proteome87), circulating 20S proteasome is likely present in vampire bats and not a technical
artifact of hemolysis or serum preparation. The 20S proteasome mediates proteasomal cleavage,
with numerous cellular roles including response to disease and oxidative stress 84. Interestingly,
IFN-γ can induce formation of the immunoproteasome, which is the circulating 20S proteasome
incorporated with β8, β9, and β10 subunits 83. The immunoproteasome has diverse functions,
including cleaving peptides into MHC class I epitopes 83. The immunoproteasome is likely
activated within hematopoietic cells, and may exist within extracellular vesicles though not
necessarily circulating in the blood 84. Though these additional immunoproteasome subunits
were not observed, it is interesting to hypothesize the role of such high levels of circulating 20S
proteasome. These results demonstrate the potential of using mass spectrometry-based methods
to study proteasomes, providing a basis for future immunological studies.

Redox-related proteins
Beyond the possible uniqueness of bat immune systems is their ability to minimize or respond to
oxidative stress. The evolution of flight in the chiropteran lineage was accompanied by
mechanisms to minimize or repair the negative effects of oxidative stress generated by this
metabolically costly activity, which may explain both the particular longevity of bats and their
apparent viral tolerance 8,88,89. For reference in Figure 2C, we have included glutathione
peroxidase levels, which do not appear very different from levels in humans, but we note that
there are higher levels of other redox-related proteins in vampire bats. Increased levels of
peroxiredoxins (PRDX1, PRDX2, and PRDX6), superoxide dismutase (SOD1), and thioredoxin
(TXN) indicate an enhanced capacity to scavenge or oppose free-radicals. High-levels of Rieske
domain-containing protein (RFESD), which facilitates binding excess iron, may be related to the
iron-rich, blood diet of vampire bats, although ferritin light chain (FTL) levels were found to be
similar between bats and humans, ranked 154 and 336, respectively. Finally, vascular noninflammatory molecule proteins (VNN2 and VNN3) have been described as being involved in
redox reactions via the production of cysteamine 90–92. Overall, these results highlight that there
may be increased oxidative resistance in vampire bats relative to humans; this pattern is likely to
be conserved across bat species given the ubiquity of flight and long lifespans in bats, but this
should be confirmed with broad comparative analyses.

“Other” interesting proteins
In addition to proteins with obvious relation to known bat physiology, there are other interesting
proteins that do not fit into a single category (Figure 2D). From this list, two sets of relationships
are noteworthy: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)/kallikrein 1 (KLK1) and hyaluronan-

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.04.411660; this version posted December 4, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

related proteins. Both ACE and KLK1 are higher in bats than humans, though their functions are
antagonistic: kallikrein increases bradykinin, which vasodilates, while ACE cleaves bradykinin
and thus may reduce vasodilation. In comparison, angiotensinogen (AGT), a source of the
vasoconstrictor peptide angiotensin 2, is almost the same rank in bats as humans (ranked 29 and
25, respectively; Supplemental Table S5). Of note, given the entry of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, is
the detection of TMPRSS9 as a mid-abundance protein in bat serum, though ACE2, which is
detected in humans (rank 2517; Supplemental Table S5), was not present in bat serum. There are
also increased hyaluronan-related proteins in vampire bat serum. The hyaluronan receptor CD44
is the same rank in bats and humans (Supplemental Table S5), though two hyaluronan carrier
proteins (ITIH2 and ITIH3) and hyaluronidase 1 (HYAL1), which hydrolyzes hyaluronan, are
higher in bats (Figure 2F). This last protein, HYAL1, is ranked 3024 in human plasma, versus
173 in vampire bat serum. It is unclear whether this indicates high levels of hyaluronan in bat
serum, which in the naked-mole rat may confer anti-cancer properties 93, or that these proteins
are involved with keeping serum hyaluronan levels low in response to infection 94. There are
additional undiscussed proteins listed in this “other” category, as well as a full list of protein
ranks compared to the Human Blood Atlas (Supplemental Table S5-S6), that researchers are
encouraged to browse for insight beyond the survey nature of this manuscript. It is interesting to
postulate that vampire bat blood may have an anti-pathogenic phenotype, but it is unclear if this
is in response to infection or constitutive. Similarly, given that many antiviral proteins are often
involved in anti-cancer roles 95, these two roles could plausibly be connected.

Pathogen detection
Data-independent acquisition (DIA) is an emerging technique in mass spectrometry-based
proteomics, which in theory should allow deeper coverage than typical data-dependent
acquisition (DDA)-based analysis by overcoming the stochastic nature of DDA data. We did not
set out to compare the two approaches, but found this to be an interesting use-case of DIA to
analyze undepleted serum. Detecting 361 proteins in undepleted serum using a relatively short 60
min gradient demonstrated that DIA-based proteomics of undepleted serum can scale reasonably
well. Moreover, we took advantage of this technique to evaluate the presence of viral proteins.
Desmodus rotundus has tested positive elsewhere in its geographic range for adenoviruses,
coronaviruses, flaviviruses, hantaviruses, herpesviruses, and paramyxoviruses, as well as for
antibodies against henipavirus-like viruses 51,54–62.Searches were performed with Rabies
lyssavirus, Adenoviridae, Betacoronavirus, Henipavirus, Herpesvirales, and Morbillivirus
databases. Using this approach, we detected no viral proteins in the human pooled sample but
identified two viral peptides in the bat sera (Supplemental Figures 2-3): PRSGIPDR from the
Rh186 protein in Macacine herpesvirus 3 (i.e., Rhesus cytomegalovirus) and LVTTEVK from
the ORF1a protein in Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
Detection of the MERS-CoV protein is of particular interest, as other betacoronaviruses have
been detected in vampire bats and cell line studies suggest their receptors (i.e., DPP4) can
support MERS-CoV replication 59,96. Although we are unaware of specific MERS-CoV detection
in vampire bats, a betacoronavirus with high amino acid similarity to MERS-CoV has been
identified in an unrelated but sympatric bat species in Mexico (Nyctinomops laticaudatus) 97.
More generally, these peptides were detected using a relatively short gradient separation of
undepleted serum, suggesting that a method enriching for viral particles prior to analysis could

easily detect more viral proteins if present. Importantly, although PCR-based techniques are
frequently used for viral surveillance in bats, a mass spectrometry-based approach could query a
larger search space while maintaining acceptable detection limits. In cases where a specific viral
taxon was targeted, mass spectrometry could provide a more accurate method of virus detection
(e.g., as evidenced by mass spectrometry-based SARS-CoV-2 detection in humans 98–101).
Targeted mass spectrometry methods using stable isotope-labeled peptides allow for
creation of sensitive, precise, and accurate assays that avoid interferences that plague antibodybased methods. The first step of developing these targeted assays is empirically confirming the
presence of predicted peptides, which is possible even in non-model species. For example,
shotgun proteomics were first used to identify proteotypic adiponectin peptides in dolphin
plasma, followed by validation of a parallel-reaction monitoring method to measure adiponectin
at nmol/L levels using heavy isotope labeled peptides 102. Any of the proteins identified in the
current study can be measured using this technique. For example, PRM assays could be
constructed for each of the 31 complement activation proteins listed, and this could be performed
in high-throughput manner. These assays would be free from measurement interference (i.e.,
cross-reactivity seen in antibody assays) with all the benefits of accuracy and precision found in
PRM-based mass spectrometry assays 103,104.

Conclusion
Our results highlight the power of modern proteomic techniques to provide new insights where
other techniques might struggle. There is tremendous value in genomic and transcriptomic
analyses; however, to understand the molecular landscape of blood, proteomic analysis is unique.

This survey of the serum proteome of a small group of vampire bats provides a first look at the
abundance of immunological proteins as well as proteins with unclear roles in the vampire bat
phenotype. Moreover, we show that mass spectrometry-based viral detection in serum is possible
and may be a viable tool for pathogen surveillance. Overall, these data can be used to develop
targeted assays for future vampire bat research while also serving as a demonstration of the
potential of proteomic studies for research on various topics in other bat species. For example,
the physiology of white-nose syndrome and longevity are important topics that could benefit
from investigations using modern biomolecular analytical techniques like proteomics. Future
work will continue to investigate if proteins elevated in vampire bats compared to humans are
similarly elevated in other mammals, or whether they are more common in wild animals than
expected and not specific to a vampire bat phenotype. There is an ongoing need for comparative
physiological studies to move beyond two-species comparisons and broaden our horizons across
multiple clades of the tree of life.

Supplemental Figure S1. Distribution of relative standard deviations in technical replicate.
One sample was injected in triplicate to evaluate technical performance of the method. Of the
361 proteins detected across the experiment, between 25 and 30 were filtered out, in total only
322 proteins were identified in all three injections. Using relative abundance from these 322
proteins, relative standard deviation (RSD) was calculated. The average RSD was 10.6 %,
median RSD was 5.1 %, and 270 (83.9 % of 322) had an RSD < 20 %.
