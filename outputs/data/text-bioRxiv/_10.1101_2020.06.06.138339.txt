Abstract
Background
With the gradual reopening of economies and resumption of social life, robust surveillance
mechanisms should be implemented to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike RTqPCR, SARS-CoV-2 Whole Genome Sequencing (cWGS) has the added advantage of
identifying cryptic origins of the virus, and the extent of community-based transmissions
versus new viral introductions, which can in turn influence public health policy decisions.
However, practical and cost considerations of cWGS should be addressed before it can be
widely implemented.
Methods
We performed shotgun transcriptome sequencing using RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal
swabs of patients with COVID-19, and compared it to targeted SARS-CoV-2 full genome
amplification and sequencing with respect to virus detection, scalability, and costeffectiveness. To track virus origin, we used open-source multiple sequence alignment and
phylogenetic tools to compare the assembled SARS-CoV-2 genomes to publicly available
sequences.
Results
We show a significant improvement in whole genome sequencing data quality and viral
detection using amplicon-based target enrichment of SARS-CoV-2. With enrichment, more
than 99% of the sequencing reads mapped to the viral genome compared to an average of
0.63% without enrichment. Consequently, a dramatic increase in genome coverage was
obtained using significantly less sequencing data, enabling higher scalability and significant
cost reductions. We also demonstrate how SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences can be used to
determine their possible origin through phylogenetic analysis including other viral strains.
Conclusions
SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing is a practical, cost-effective, and powerful approach
for population-based surveillance and control of viral transmission in the next phase of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to inflict devastating human life losses (1), and has
enforced significant social changes and global economic shut downs (2). With the
accumulating financial burdens and unemployment rates, several governments are sketching
out plans for slowly re-opening the economy and reviving social life and economic activity.
However, robust population-based surveillance systems are essential to track viral
transmission during the re-opening process.
While RT-qPCR targeting SARS-CoV-2 can be effective in identifying infected individuals for
isolation and contact tracing, it is not useful in determining which viral strains are circulating
in the community: autochthonous versus imported ones, and – if imported – it is important
to know the origin of the strains, which in turn influences public health policy decisions. In
addition, it is vital to identify super-spreader events as they can be influenced by the virus
strain (3). SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing (cWGS), on the other hand, can detect the
virus and can delineate its origins through phylogenetic analysis (4, 5) in combination with
other local and international viral strains, especially given the accumulation of thousands of
viral sequences from countries all over the world (www.nextstrain.org) (Figure 1). However,
practical considerations, such as cost, scalability, and data storage, should first be investigated
to assess the feasibility of implementing cWGS as a population-based surveillance tool. Here
we show that cWGS is cost-effective and is highly scalable when using a target enrichment
sequencing method, and we also demonstrate its utility in tracking the origin of SARS-CoV-2
transmission.
Materials and Methods
Human subjects and ethics approval
All patients had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 based on positive RT-PCR assay for SARSCoV-2 in the Centralized Dubai Health Authority (DHA) virology laboratory. This study was
approved by the Dubai Scientific Research Ethics Committee - Dubai Health Authority
(approval number #DSREC-04/2020_02).
RNA extraction and SARS-CoV-2 detection
Viral RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs of patients with COVID-19 using the
EZ1 DSP Virus Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), optimized for viral and bacterial nucleic acids

extractions from human specimens using magnetic bead technology. SARS-CoV-2 positive
results were confirmed using a RT-PCR assay, originally designed by the US Centres for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and is currently provided by Integrated DNA
Technologies (IDT, IA, USA). This assay consists of oligonucleotide primers and dual-labelled
hydrolysis (TaqMan®) probes (5’FAM/3’Black Hole Quencher) specific for two regions (N1
and N2) of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene. An additional primer/probe set is also included
to detect the human RNase P gene (RP) as an extraction control. The reverse transcription
and amplification steps are performed using the TaqPathTM 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix
(ThermoFisher, MA, USA) following manufacturer’s instructions. A sample was considered
positive if the cycle threshold (Ct) values were less than 40 for each of the SARS-CoV-2
targets (N1 and N2) and the extraction control (RP). To estimate the viral load relative to
human RNA, we calculated the ΔCt value for each target as follows: ΔCt = CtNn – CtRP, where
Nn is either N1 or N2. The average of the N1 and N2 target ΔCt values was then negated to
reach a relative estimate of viral load which is inversely correlated with Ct value.
Shotgun transcriptome SARS-CoV-2 sequencing
RNA libraries from all samples were prepared for shotgun transcriptomic sequencing using
the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library kit from Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA), following
manufacturer’s instructions. RNA specific fluorescent dye is used to quantify extracted RNA
using the Qubit RNA XR assay kit and the Qubit Flourometer system (ThermoFisher, MA,
USA). Then, 1µg of input RNA from each patient sample was depleted for human ribosomal
RNA, and the remaining RNA underwent fragmentation, reverse transcription (using the
SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase Kit from Invitrogen, Carisbad, USA), adaptor ligation,
and amplification. Libraries were then sequenced using the NovaSeq SP Reagent kit (2 X 150
cycles) from Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA).
Targeted amplification and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genome
RNA extracted (~1µg) from patient nasopharyngeal swabs was used for double stranded
cDNA synthesis using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
according to manufacturer’s protocol. This cDNA was then evenly distributed into 26 PCR
reactions for SARS-CoV-2 whole genome amplification using 26 overlapping primer sets
covering most of its genome (Figure 2A and Supplemental Table 1). The SARS-CoV-2 primer

sets used in this study were modified from Wu et al (6) by adding M13 tails to enable
sequencing by Sanger, if needed (Supplemental Table 1). PCR amplification was performed
using the PlatinumTM SuperFiTM PCR Master Mix (ThermoFisher, MA, USA) and a thermal
protocol consisting of an initial denaturation at 98°C for 60 seconds, followed by 27 cycles of
denaturation (98°C for 17 seconds), annealing (57°C for 20 seconds), and extension (72°C
for 1 minute and 53 seconds). A final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes was applied before
retrieving the final PCR products. Amplification was confirmed by running 2µl from each
reaction on a 2% agarose gel.
All PCR products were then purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter,
CA, USA), quantified by NanoDrop (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), diluted to the same
concentration, and then pooled into one tube for next steps.
A minimum of 200-800ng of the pooled PCR products in 55µl were then sheared by ultrasonication (Covaris LE220-plus series, MA, USA) to generate a target fragment size of 250750bp using the following parameters: 20% Duty Factor, Peak Power of 150 Watts, 900
cycles per burst, 320 seconds Treatment Time, an Average Power of 30 Watts, and 20°C bath
temperature. Target fragmentation were confirmed by the TapeStation automated
electrophoresis system TapeStation (Agilent, CA, USA) (Figure 2A). Subsequently, the
fragmented product is purified and then processed to generate sequencing-ready libraries
using the SureSelectXT Library Preparation kit (Agilent, CA, USA) following manufacturer
instructions. Indexed libraries from multiple patients were pooled and sequenced (2 X 150
cycles) using the MiSeq or the NovaSeq systems (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). A step-bystep SARS-CoV-2 target enrichment and sequencing protocol is provided in Appendix I.
Bioinformatics analysis and SARS-CoV-2 genome assembly
Demultiplexed Fastq reads, obtained through shotgun or target enrichment sequencing, were
generated from raw sequencing base call files using BCL2Fastq v2.20.0, and then mapped to
the reference Wuhan genome (GenBank accession number: NC_045512.2) by BurrowWheeler Aligner, BWA v0.7.17. Alignment statistics, such as coverage and mapped reads, were
generated using Picard 2.18.17. Variant calling was performed by GATK v3.8-1-0, and was
followed by SARS-CoV-2 genome assembly using BCFtools v.1.3.1 (Figure 2B).

https://www.genomedetective.com/app/typingtool/virus/) (7,8), composed of the above
tools, can be used to generate viral sequences from raw Fastq data.
For downstream analysis, a general quality control metric was implemented to ensure
assembled SARS-CoV-2 genomes have at least 20X average coverage (sequencing reads
>Q30) across most nucleotide positions (56-29,797).
For target enrichment and shotgun sequencing comparisons in Table 1, we used data from 7
samples (UAE/P1/2020, L0287, L1189, L4711, L5857, L6841, L9119) generated using both
methods. Data from patient L5630 were not included in this analysis since, unlike the above
7 samples, significantly more sequencing data was allocated for the target enriched sample in
this patient (Supplemental Table 2) which can overestimate the efficiency of the target
enrichment protocol.
All new SARS-CoV-2 sequences (n=7) generated in this study were submitted to GISAID
(Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) under accession IDs: EPI_ISL_463740 and
EPI_ISL_469276 to EPI_ISL_469281.
Phylogenetic analysis
We used Nexstrain (9), which consists of Augur v6.4.3 pipeline for multiple sequence
alignment (MAFFT v7.455) (10) and phylogenetic tree construction (IQtree v1.6.12) (11).
Tree topology was assessed using the fast bootstrapping function with 1,000 replicates. Tree
visualization and annotations were performed in FigTree v1.4.4 (12).
Results
SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing
Shotgun transcriptome sequencing was used to fully sequence SARS-CoV-2 RNA extracted
from patients (n=17) who tested positive for the virus (4). Analysis of the sequencing data
showed that this approach required, on average, 4.71Gb of data per sample yielding 31.7
million total reads, of which approximately 0.63% of the reads (~199,000 reads) mapped to
the SARS-CoV-2 genome with an average coverage of ~173x (Table 1). This is attributed to

the fact that most of the shotgun data (~99%) is allocated to the human transcriptome while
a minority of the reads align to the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Table 1). In addition to cost and
storage considerations discussed below, this approach is not highly sensitive for detecting
SARS-CoV-2 genomes in general and specifically in samples with low viral abundance. In fact,
despite high viral abundance relative to human RNA, most samples had less than 100x
sequencing coverage across the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Samples with seemingly very low viral
loads failed to yield full SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence using this approach (Table 1 and
Figure 3A).
To enrich viral sequences and minimize sequencing cost and data storage issues addressed
below, we describe an alternative approach where the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome is first
amplified using 26 overlapping primer sets each yielding around 1.5kb long inserts (Figures
2A, 3B and Supplemental Table 1). All inserts were then pooled and fragmented to 250750bp inserts which were then prepared for short read next generation sequencing (Figures
2A and 3C).
RNA extracted from eight COVID-19 patients, which were first sequenced by shotgun
transcriptome (Table 1 and Supplemental Table 2), were sequenced using the enrichment
protocol. As expected, we observed significant enhancement in virus detection using this
protocol where, on average, 99.3% of the reads now mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 genome
leading to tenfold increase in coverage relative to shotgun transcriptome (avg. 440x versus
45.5x, respectively) despite generating a two hundred fold less sequencing data (avg. 0.02Gb
versus 4.28Gb, respectively, Table 2 and Figure 3D).
Cost, data storage and scalability
On average, 37x coverage per 1Gb of sequencing data was generated using shotgun
sequencing (Table 1) compared to ~23,000x per 1Gb using target enrichment (Table 2)
suggesting the latter method is more cost effective and is highly scalable. We calculate the
cost of SARS-CoV-2 full genome sequencing to be ~$87 per sample when sequencing 96
samples in a batch at 400x using the target enrichment method. The number of samples in a
batch can be doubled (196) while maintaining a low cost (~$104) and a very high coverage of
40,000x per sample (Table 3). On the other hand, the cost of sequencing one sample at a
much lower coverage (50x) using the shotgun method is $403, while increasing sequencing

coverage more than doubled the cost ($1735 at 100x and $1060 at 200x) (Table 3). However,
using higher throughput sequencing can significantly lower the cost of shotgun sequencing to
$232 for 62 samples in a batch at 200x per sample. Nonetheless, using a similar throughput,
the per sample cost of enrichment sequencing is $108 for 196 samples in a batch where each
sample receives significantly more coverage (~40,000x) (Table 3). Therefore, target
enrichment sequencing is still more cost-effective and scalable than shotgun transcriptome
sequencing even at higher sequencing throughputs.
Another factor impeding scalability of the shotgun approach is data storage. Even with higher
throughput sequencing (NovaSeq SP flowcell), shotgun sequencing requires an allocation of
1TB of data for ~250 sequenced samples. On the other hand, with 1TB of data, a total of
around 80,000 samples can be sequenced using the enrichment method and the MiSeq Micro
flowcell (Table 3). Therefore, long term data storage allocations, and cost, are significantly
higher, and perhaps formidable, when using the shotgun sequencing approach.
Genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 origin
To illustrate the utility of SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing, we tracked the origin(s) of
the virus in seven patients (UAE/P1/2020, L0287, L1189, L4711, L5857, L6841, L9119) by
comparing their assembled sequences to virus strains (n=25) identified during the early phase
of the pandemic, between January 29 and March 18 2020, in the UAE (4). All seven patient
samples were collected between March 28 and April 5 2020, and are therefore good
candidates to determine whether transmissions were community-based due to the previously
documented 25 strains or were independent external introductions.
Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis (Figures 2B and 4) showed that the
new isolates from patients L0287, L4711, L1189, and L5857 clustered with earlier strains of
Iranian origin (or clade A3), while that from patient L9119 belonged to the early European (or
clade A2a) cluster (Figure 4). This information suggests that transmissions for all those five
patients were most likely community-based, which we then confirmed from patient medical
records where no recent travel history was reported by any of those individuals.
SARS-CoV-2 isolates from patients P1/UAE/2020 and L6841 were, on the other hand, closer
to the earliest Asian strains, which are more diverse due to fewer but distinct mutations
(Figure 4). Hence, with the available sequencing data it is challenging to ascertain whether

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.06.138339; this version posted June 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

the P1/UAE/2020 and L6841 transmissions were community-based or due to early
independent introductions. However, patient L6841 did not have any recent travel history
before symptoms onset, suggesting the case for community-based transmission related to an
Asian strain. On the other hand, travel history in patient P1/UAE/2020 was not known and
the corresponding isolate appeared to match closely to five other strains from the United
States and Taiwan (Figure 4). Therefore, transmission in patient P1/UAE/2020 was unlikely
to be community-based from the early 25 strains (4), but rather due to an independent travelrelated introduction of the virus.
Discussion
Genomics-based SARS-CoV-2 population-based surveillance is a powerful tool for controlling
viral transmission during the next phase of the pandemic. Therefore, it is important to devise
efficient methods for SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing for downstream phylogenetic analysis
and virus origin tracking. Towards this goal, we describe a cost-effective, robust, and highly
scalable target enrichment sequencing approach, and provide an example to demonstrate its
utility in characterizing transmission origin.
Our target enrichment protocol is amplicon-based for which oligonucleotide primers can be
easily ordered by any molecular laboratory. Next generation sequencing (NGS) has also
become largely accessible to most labs, and in our protocol we show that highly affordable,
low throughput sequencers, such as the Illumina MiSeq system, can be used efficiently to
sequence up to 96 samples at 400x coverage each at a cost of $87 per sample (Table 3). This
cost is likely comparable to RT-PCR testing for the virus.
One possible limitation is the use of ultra-sonication for fragmentation of PCR products after
SARS-CoV-2 whole genome amplification. Several labs might lack sonication systems due to
accessibility and affordability issues. In such situations, our protocol can be easily modified to
use enzymatic fragmentation instead provided by commercial kits, such as the Agilent
SureSelectQXT kit. Furthermore, we have added M13 tails to all our primer sets making them
amenable to Sanger sequencing for those labs not equipped with NGS. However, with this
approach, manual analysis of sequencing data limits scalability of the approach.
Upon sequence generation, the bioinformatics analysis can be performed using open source
scripts. Labs without bioinformatics expertise or support can use online tools (INSaFlu:

sequencing (Fastq) files to assemble viral genomes, and to perform multiple sequence
alignment and phylogenetic analysis for virus origin tracking. In addition, the described
approach does not require significant data storage or computational investment as shown by
our cost, data, and scalability calculations (Table 3).
Our phylogenetic analysis demonstrates how SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing can be used
to track origins of virus transmission. However, data should be carefully interpreted, and
should be combined with other epidemiological information (such as travel history) to avoid
inaccurate conclusions. The major limitation facing genomic-based SARS-CoV-2 surveillance
includes the lack of virus sequencing data representing most strains in any country.
Nonetheless, SARS-CoV-2 strains are continuously being sequenced by government, private,
and academic entities all over the world, and the sequencing data is being shared publicly. This
proliferation of sequencing datasets will empower genomic-based surveillance of the virus,
and the availability of cost effective sequencing options, like the one described in this study,
will contribute to democratizing SARS-CoV-2 sequencing and data sharing.
In summary, we show that SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing is a highly feasible and
effective tool for tracking virus transmission. Genomic data can be used to determine
community-based versus imported transmissions, which can then inform the most
appropriate public health decisions to control the pandemic.

Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing-based surveillance.

A schematic

illustrating how SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing (cWGS) can be used as a surveillance
tool to uncover community-based versus international/travel-related introductions.
Mutations are represented by coloured dots or circles on SARS-CoV-2 genomes (black bars)
within each patient with COVID-19. A population of viral genomes in a community can be used
as a reference set (circled blue) for future analysis when new cases (circled orange) emerge.
Two scenarios are represented for the new case: the first represents community transmission
while the second represents external introduction. The strain representing community
transmission has two mutations, one of which (blue) has been identified in a strain from a
previous patient in this community, while the second is a new mutation (brick red), arising as
part of the virus evolution. The strain with a single novel mutation (green) not seen previously
in this population represents a new introduction.

SARS-CoV-2 genome assembly, multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis. All
steps are described in details in Methods.

Relationship between the RT-PCR cycling threshold and sequencing coverage over the SARSCoV-2 genome. –ΔCt is calculated as an estimate of viral load relative to human RNA (see
Methods). Red circles represent lowest –ΔCt values (and lowest relative viral abundance)
from samples with very low sequencing coverage. Sequencing data were generated by the
shotgun method. B, an agarose gel showing the overlapping 26 PCR products (~1.5kb)

by ultra-sonication. D, SARS-CoV-2 sequence coverage comparison using target enrichment
and shotgun sequencing methods in one sample (P1/UAE/2020). top, sequencing coverage
across the SARS-CoV-2 genomic positions using shotgun transcriptome sequencing (average
coverage ~200x); bottom, sequencing coverage across SARS-CoV-2 genome (from same
patient sample P1/UAE/2020) using target enrichment (average coverage ~1,400x). E, an
example of De novo assembly of the viral genome isolated from patient P1/UAE/2020 shows
clear overlap with the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome.
Figure 4. Phylogenetic relationships of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from new patients in this
study and previous ‘early’ patients in the UAE, and other countries. A maximum likelihood
phylogeny of 37 SARS-CoV-2 genomes (7 obtained in this study (Supplemental Table 2), 5
downloaded from GISAID database (https://www.epicov.org/), and 25 genomes from early
patients in UAE (4)). Bootstrap values >70% supporting major branches are shown. The
previous European, Iranian, and Asian clusters are highlighted. The 5 non-UAE isolates were
selected based on a BLAST search against GISAID database (last accessed 11 May 2020) and
high similarity to the P1/UAE/2020 isolate (all red branches). Scale bar represents number
of nucleotide substitutions per site. UAE = United Arab Emirates. GISAID = Global Initiative
on Sharing All Influenza Data.
