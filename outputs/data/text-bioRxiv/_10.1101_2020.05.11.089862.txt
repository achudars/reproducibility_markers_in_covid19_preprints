Abstract.

18

As the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic evolves, the development of

19

immunoassays to help determine exposure and potentially predict immunity has

20

become a pressing priority. In this report we present the performance of the

21

EUROIMMUN enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for semi-quantitative

22

detection of IgA and IgG antibodies in serum and plasma samples using recombinant

23

S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as antigen. Specimens from patients, with

24

and without COVID-19 infection, were tested at the University of Chicago Clinical

25

Microbiology and Immunology Laboratory. Of 57 samples from COVID-19 PCR-

26

negative patients, including 28 samples positive for common human coronavirus strains,

27

53 tested negative and 4 tested positive for IgA (93.0% agreement) while 56 tested

28

negative and 1 tested positive for IgG (98.2% agreement). For COVID-19 PCR-positive

29

patients, 29 of 30 (96.7%) samples collected ≥3 days after positive PCR were positive

30

for IgA, and 28 of 28 samples collected ≥4 days after positive PCR were positive for

31

IgG.

32

The EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA Assay demonstrates excellent sensitivity

33

for detection of IgA and IgG antibodies from samples collected ≥3 days and ≥4 days,

34

respectively, after COVID-19 diagnosis by PCR. This assay did not demonstrate cross

35

reaction in any of the 28 samples from patients with common human coronaviruses,

36

including types HKU1, NL63, CV229E, and OC43.

Introduction

39

In December 2019 a novel coronavirus emerged as the cause of severe respiratory

40

disease and quickly spread causing a worldwide pandemic. Severe Acute Respiratory

41

Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was determined to be the agent of coronavirus disease

42

2019 (COVID-19). The virus belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae

43

family, which also includes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 1 (SARS-

44

CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (1). For

45

diagnostic purposes many nucleic acid amplification assays were quickly developed

46

and received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the US Food and Drug

47

Administration (FDA). Multiple manufacturers are offering serological assays, but few

48

have received Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration

49

(FDA); the EUROIMMUN IgG assay has received Emergency Use Authorization.

50

Serological testing may be useful in conjunction with other laboratory tests and clinical

51

findings of COVID-19 infection for epidemiological monitoring and outbreak control. Of

52

the immunoassays currently available, choice of SARS-CoV-2 target antigens include

53

the spike protein (S) or the nucelocapsid (N) (2). IgA antibodies can show higher

54

sensitivity, while IgG antibodies typically have longer duration, better specificity, and are

55

better suited for serosurveillance studies (3-5).

58

The EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

59

(ELISA) that provides semi-quantitative in vitro determination of human antibodies of

60

immunoglobulin classes IgA and IgG against severe acute respiratory syndrome

61

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in serum or EDTA plasma (6-7).

62

Each kit contains microplate strips with 8 break-off reagent wells coated with recombinant

63

structural protein of SARS-CoV-2. In the first reaction step, diluted patient samples are

64

incubated in the wells. In the case of positive samples, specific antibodies will bind to the

65

antigens. To detect the bound antibodies, a second incubation is carried out using an

66

enzyme-labelled antihuman IgA or IgG (enzyme conjugate) catalyzing a color reaction.

67

Results are evaluated semi-quantitatively by calculation of a ratio of the extinction of the

68

control or patient sample over the extinction of the calibrator. This ratio is interpreted as

69

follows:

70



Ratio < 0.8 negative

71



Ratio ≥ 0.8 to <1.0 borderline

72



Ratio ≥ 1.1 positive

73

The IgG assay has received Emergency Use Authorization from the US Food and Drug

74

Administration (FDA).

75
76

The University of Chicago Medicine uses 2 different RT-PCR assays allowed by the

77

FDA under Emergency Use Authorization. The Roche cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 assay

78

relies on amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 specific ORF1 gene as well as a portion of

79

the E-gene conserved across the sarbecoviruses, a subgenus of coronaviruses which

80

includes SARS-CoV-2. The Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay also detects the

81

pan-sarbecovirus E-gene but uses the SARS-CoV-2 specific N-gene rather than ORF1

82

as its primary target. Samples tested include nasopharyngeal and nasal mid-turbinate

83

swabs transported in viral transport or liquid Amies media.

84
85

The BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel 2 (RP2) is a multiplex in vitro molecular

86

diagnostic test for the simultaneous and rapid detection of 21 pathogens, including 4

87

common human coronavirus strains, directly from nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)

88

samples.

89
90

Stored residual serum and plasma samples submitted to the University of Chicago

91

Medicine Clinical Laboratories for routine testing were recovered for this evaluation.

92

Percent agreement was determined and the hybrid Wilson/Brown method was used to

93

calculate 95% confidence intervals of proportions (95% CI). All statistical analyses were

94

performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.4.1.

Results

97

Fifty-seven samples were tested from patients thought to be negative for exposure to

98

SARS-CoV-2. Forty-one of the samples were from ambulatory patients at the University

99

of Chicago with negative results for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. The remaining 16 samples

100

were collected in early 2019, prior to the current pandemic, and stored at -20oC.

101

Twenty-eight of the 57 samples were from patients who had tested positive by the

102

BioFire FilmArray RP2 respiratory viral panel for common coronavirus strains (6

103

samples positive for HKU1, 10 positive for NL63, 9 positive for OC43, 2 positive for

104

229E, and one positive for both OC43 and 229E).

105
106
107

Of these 57 samples, 53 tested negative and 4 tested positive for IgA (93.0%

108

agreement, 95% CI: 83.3-97.2) while 56 tested negative and 1 tested positive for IgG

109

(98.2% agreement, 95% CI: 90.7-99.9).

110

The sample that was positive for IgG was also positive for IgA. Chart review revealed

111

an episode 4 weeks prior of a fever of 103.5°F and diarrhea, without cough. This

112

clinical picture that could be consistent with COVID-19 disease. This positive

113

serological result and negative PCR could represent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 with

114

clearance of the virus.

115

Samples from sixty-seven unique specimens from 49 patients with PCR-positive SARS-

116

CoV-2 were tested. Of these samples, 55 tested positive and 12 tested negative for IgA

117

(82.1% agreement, 95% CI: 71.3-89.4) while 40 tested positive and 27 tested negative

118

for IgG (59.7% agreement, 95% CI: 47.7-70.6). Six borderline positives for IgA and 2

119

borderline positives for IgG were included in the positive results.

120
121

These 67 samples from PCR positive patients were collected 0 to 45 days after PCR

122

testing. The 12 IgA-negative samples and the 27 IgG-negative samples were collected

123

within 7 days of PCR testing. Since antibody development occurs after viremia and

124

requires time to reach a detectable concentration, it is likely that these samples were

125

collected too early in the course of disease to expect antibody production.

126
127

The 67 serological samples from SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients were stratified by

128

the number of days following the positive PCR result. For samples collected ≥3 days

129

after positive PCR, 29 of 30 (96.7%, 95% CI: 83.3-99.8) were positive for IgA (see chart

130

1); all 21 samples collected after one week were IgA positive. For samples collected ≥4

131

days after positive PCR, 28 of 28 (100%, 95% CI: 87.9-100) were positive for IgG (see

132

chart 2).

Cross-reactivity

140

A total of 28 unique samples that tested positive by BioFire FilmArray RP2 panel for

141

common human coronaviruses including types 229E, NL63, HKU1 and OC43 were

142

tested for cross reactivity. All 28 tested negative for both IgA and IgG antibodies.

143
144

Discussion

145

A positive or negative test for the SARS-CoV2 antibody is difficult to interpret at this

146

time. It is not yet known if antibodies serve as an indication of the presence or absence

147

of protective or sustained immunity. Negative SARS-CoV-2 antibody results do not rule

148

out SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in those who have been in contact with the virus.

149

Results from antibody testing should not be used as the sole basis to diagnose or

150

exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection or to inform infection status. Our evaluation of the

151

EUROIMMUN assay did not demonstrate any cross reaction with samples from patients

152

positive for common human coronaviruses.

153
154

Conclusion

155

The EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA Assay demonstrated excellent sensitivity

156

for detection of IgA and IgG antibodies from samples collected >2 days and >3 days,

157

respectively, after COVID-19 diagnosis by PCR. The EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2

158

ELISA Assay demonstrated excellent specificity and did not demonstrate cross reaction

159

with common human coronaviruses, including types HKU1, NL63, CV229E, and OC43.
