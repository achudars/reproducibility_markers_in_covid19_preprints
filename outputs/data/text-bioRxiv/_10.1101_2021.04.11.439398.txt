Abstract

25
26

Previous studies suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may gain access to the brain

27

by using a route along the olfactory nerve. However, there is a general consensus that

28

the obligatory virus entry receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is not

29

expressed in olfactory receptor neurons, and the timing of arrival of the virus in brain

30

targets is inconsistent with a neuronal transfer along olfactory projections. We

31

determined whether nervus terminalis neurons and their peripheral and central

32

projections may provide an alternative route from the nose to the brain. Nervus

33

terminalis neurons were double-labeled with antibodies against ACE2 and nervus

34

terminalis markers in postnatal mice. We show that most nervus terminalis neurons

35

with cell bodies in the region between the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb

36

express ACE2, and therefore may provide a direct route for the virus from the nasal

37

epithelium and Bowman’s glands to brain targets, including the telencephalon and

38

diencephalon.

INTRODUCTION

43

Many previous reports have suggested that the severe acute respiratory syndrome

44

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) gains access to the brain by using an olfactory route from

45

the nose to the brain (Bougakov et al., 2020; Briguglio et al., 2020; Butowt and Bilinska,

46

2020; Li et al., 2020; Meinhardt et al., 2020; Natoli et al., 2020; Zubair et al., 2021;

47

Burks et al., 2021), similar to other neuro-invasive viruses that have been shown to

48

infect olfactory receptor neurons and spread from these first-order olfactory neurons to

49

secondary and tertiary targets in the brain (Barnett and Perlman, 1993; van Riel et al.,

50

2015; Dubé et al., 2018). Indeed, it has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 can accumulate

51

in various brain regions, in animal models (reviewed in: Butowt and von Bartheld, 2020;

52

Rathnasinghe et al., 2020) and in a small number of human patients with COVID-19

53

(Ellul et al., 2020; Matschke et al., 2020; Meinhardt et al., 2020; Mukerji and Solomon,

54

2020; Solomon, 2021).

55
56

However, the route along the olfactory nerve from the nose to the brain is controversial

57

for SARS-CoV-2, primarily for two reasons: (1) the olfactory receptor neurons do not

58

express the obligatory virus entry receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2

59

(ACE2), or expression is restricted to a very small subset of these neurons (Butowt

60

and von Bartheld, 2020; Cooper et al., 2020). Because sustentacular cells tightly

61

enwrap olfactory receptor neurons (Liang, 2020), these ACE2-expressing support cells

62

can easily be mistaken for olfactory receptor neurons, resulting in false positive

63

identification. (2) The timeline of appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in the brain is

64

inconsistent with a “neuron-hopping” mode: infection of third-order olfactory targets

65

should occur with a significant delay after infection of the olfactory epithelium, as has

66

been reported for other neuro-invasive viruses (Barnett et al., 1995), but instead the

67

hypothalamus and brainstem are reported to be infected as early as, or even earlier

68

than, the olfactory bulb (de Melo et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020), and SARS-CoV-2

69

may even skip the olfactory nerve and olfactory bulb on its way to brain infection

70

(Winkler et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Carossino et al., 2021). These findings have

71

raised doubt about the notion that the olfactory nerve serves as a major conduit for

72

brain infection in COVID-19.

74

With few exceptions (Briguglio et al., 2020; Butowt and von Bartheld, 2020), studies

75

suggesting an olfactory route for SARS-CoV-2 to achieve brain infection fail to consider

76

an alternative route from the nose to the brain, the route via the nervus terminalis.

77

Many peripheral processes of the nervus terminalis innervate the olfactory epithelium,

78

the blood vessels below this epithelium, as well as cells in Bowman’s glands (Larsell,

79

1950), and the central processes of some of these neurons extend to various targets

80

in the forebrain as far caudal as the hypothalamus (Pearson, 1941; Larsell, 1950;

81

Schwanzel-Fukuda et al., 1987; Demski, 1993; von Bartheld, 2004). Some of the

82

nervus terminalis neurons are in direct contact with spaces containing cerebrospinal

83

fluid (CSF) in the region of the olfactory nerve and bulb (Jennes, 1987). About 30-40%

84

of the neurons of the nervus terminalis express gonadotropin-releasing hormone

85

(GnRH) and some of these neurons may release GnRH into blood vessels below the

86

olfactory epithelium (Jennes, 1987; Schwanzel-Fukuda et al., 1987), while other

87

neuronal populations of the nervus terminalis system are thought to regulate blood flow

88

and blood pressure in the nose and forebrain (Larsell, 1918; Oelschläger et al., 1987;

89

Ridgway et al., 1987). These properties make the nervus terminalis a strong candidate

90

for expression of ACE2, known to regulate blood flow and blood pressure in many

91

tissues (Tikellis and Thomas, 2012). Expression of ACE2 in the nervus terminalis

92

would suggest that this cranial nerve is a plausible alternative to the olfactory nerve for

93

SARS-CoV-2 virus to gain access to the brain. However, it has not been previously

94

examined and reported whether nervus terminalis neurons express the obligatory viral

95

entry receptor, ACE2. We have therefore examined whether ACE2 is expressed in

96

these neurons in an animal model, the postnatal mouse.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

101
102

Animals and tissue processing

103

A total of six wildtype C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory) at age 3-4 weeks old were

104

used to obtain tissue material for experiments. Mice were housed with a 12/12 h

105

light/dark cycle and given access to water and food ad libitum. All animal experiments

106

were approved by the local ethics committee for animal research at Bydgoszcz

107

(Poland). Immediately after cervical dislocation, the mice were exsanguinated and

108

tissues were dissected. Olfactory epithelium and brain were frozen at −80 °C for

109

storage and further usage or fixed 3 h at 4 °C in 4% (w/v) freshly prepared

110

paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7,5) and then incubated in

111

25% (w/v) sucrose/PBS at 4° C for 16−24 h, frozen in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (Sakura

112

Finetek), and cryosectioned at 10-12 μm using a Leica CM1850 cryostat.

113
114

ACE2 -/- knockout (ACE2 KO) control

115

To verify the specificity of the ACE2 antibody, an ACE2 knock-out (KO) mouse line

116

was obtained from Taconic (strain #18180). Two male homozygous ACE2 KO mice at

117

age 3 weeks old were processed and immunolabeled as described below for wildtype

118

mice. Genotyping was performed according to the manufacturer’s suggested PCR

119

protocol. Lack of an ACE2 protein band was confirmed by using Western blots (not

120

shown).

121
122

Immunocytochemistry and co-localization analysis

123

For single immunofluorescence labeling, frozen sections cut at 10-12 μm were stained

124

overnight with a mixture of primary goat anti-ACE2 at 1/500 dilution and rabbit anti-

125

GnRH (gonadotropin releasing hormone) at 4 °C. Next day sections were washed five

126

times in PBST (PBS with 0.05% Triton X-100) and incubated with a mixture of

127

secondary anti-rabbit-AF488 antibody and anti-goat-AF594 at 1/500 dilution for 60 min

128

at room temperature. Next, sections were stained for 5 min at room temperature in

129

Hoechst 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich) to visualize cell nuclei and embedded in antifade

130

medium (Vector laboratories). Alternatively, cryosections were stained with rabbit

131

polyclonal anti-CHAT (choline acetyltransferase) instead of rabbit anti-GnRH antibody

132

in the double staining primary antibody mixture. Occasionally, sections were stained

133

with anti-OMP (olfactory marker protein) at 1/500 dilution in PBST, following the same

134

protocol. After immunocytochemical reactions, sections were analyzed on a Nikon

135

Eclipse 80i microscope and images were taken using a Nikon DP80 camera.

136

Microscopic images were processed using CellSense software (Nikon corp).

137

Antibodies used in this study are listed in Supplemental Material, Table S1.

138
139

Cell counting and statistical analysis

140

For counting double labeled cells, four male wildtype mice at age 3-4 weeks old were

141

used. Approximately every third coronal cryosection (10-12 μm thickness) was stained

142

as described above, and positive cells were counted in tissue sections under a

143

fluorescent microscope as indicated in Fig. 1 (the medial region from the posterior

144

olfactory epithelium to the caudal end of the olfactory bulb). For each animal, the

145

percentage of double labeled GnRH+/ACE2+ cells was calculated in relation to the

146

total number of GnRH-positive cells detected. The same protocol was applied for

147

counting cholinergic nervus terminalis neurons co-labeled with ACE2. A total number

148

of approximately 100 GnRH-positive neurons and 50 CHAT-positive neurons were

149

counted from four animals. The results were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software.

150

Results are presented as mean ± SEM.

RESULTS

153
154

It was previously shown that GnRH is a marker for a major fraction of nervus terminalis

155

neurons (Jennes, 1987; Schwanzel-Fukuda et al., 1987; Demski, 1993; Kim et al.,

156

1999; von Bartheld, 2004). Immunolabeling for GnRH in 3-4 week-old mice showed

157

labeled cells localized along the olfactory nerve between the olfactory epithelium and

158

the olfactory bulbs (Fig. 2A-H), as expected from previous studies in rodents

159

(Schwanzel-Fukuda et al., 1986; Wirsig and Leonard, 1986; Schwanzel-Fukuda et al.,

160

1987). The majority of the GnRH-positive nervus terminalis neurons was located along

161

the midline in the posterior part of the olfactory epithelium and adjacent to the olfactory

162

bulbs. Preliminary examination revealed that these cells were in the same vicinity as

163

cells labeled with the ACE2 antibody (Fig. 2A-B, E-F). The large majority of GnRH-

164

positive nervus terminalis neurons were fusiform and unipolar in shape.

165
166

Double-label of GnRH and ACE2 neurons with quantification

167

In order to determine whether some neurons of the nervus terminalis contained both

168

GnRH and ACE2, and to estimate the number of such cells, we performed double

169

immunolabeling experiments, and single- and double-labeled cells were counted on

170

15-20 sections from three different animals. The analyzed olfactory epithelium and

171

olfactory bulb region and section’s cutting plane are as indicated in Fig. 1. After

172

counting a total of 107 double positive (GnRH+/ACE2+) cells it was calculated that

173

90.9% of them were double-labeled (Fig. 3). Controls included omission of the primary

174

antibody (not shown) and double immunofluorescent reactions performed using

175

cryosections derived from an ACE2 knockout mouse as shown in Fig. 2 (I-L). The

176

GnRH-positive cells were never positive for olfactory marker protein (OMP), a marker

177

for mature olfactory receptor neurons (Fig. S1, supplementary materials). The total

178

number of GnRH+ nervus terminalis neurons per mouse was estimated to be

179

approximately 125, which is very similar to a previous serial section analysis in hamster

180

(about 130-140 GnRH+ neurons, Wirsig and Leonard, 1986).

181
182

Double-label of CHAT and ACE2 neurons with quantification

183

The nervus terminalis complex is comprised of several distinct heterogenic populations

184

of neurons. In addition to GnRH cells which form the majority of nervus terminalis cells,

185

the second largest nervus terminalis subpopulation are cholinergic neurons that can

186

be identified by the presence of choline acetyltransferase (CHAT) or cholinesterase

187

(Wirsig and Leonard, 1986; Demski, 1993; von Bartheld, 2004). Therefore, CHAT

188

neurons were also double labeled with ACE2 and the fraction of CHAT-positive and

189

ACE2-positive neurons was estimated out of a total of 51 CHAT-positive neurons in

190

four animals. In contrast to GnRH+/ACE2+ cells, only a minor fraction of about 9.4%

191

of CHAT-positive cells were labeled with ACE2 which suggests that very few

192

cholinergic nervus terminalis cells express ACE2 protein (Fig. 3). The large majority of

193

CHAT-positive and also ACE2-positive nervus terminalis neurons were fusiform and

194

unipolar in shape. Control experiments included omission of primary antibody (not

195

shown) and double immunofluorescent reactions performed using cryosections

196

derived from ACE2 knockout mouse (see below). The total number of CHAT-positive

197

nervus terminalis neurons per mouse was estimated to be approximately 60-70. This

198

is less than the 130-140 acetylcholinesterase containing nervus terminalis neurons in

199

hamster (Wirsig and Leonard, 1986), but it is known that only a fraction of neurons

200

containing acetylcholinesterase actually are cholinergic (Schwanzel-Fukuda et al.,

201

1986).

202
203

Knock-out control mice for ACE2 -/-

204

Immunolabeling experiments did not reveal any signal beyond background when the

205

primary antibodies were omitted. For more precise visualization of background ACE2

206

staining, tissue derived from ACE2 knock-out mouse was used. Experiments using

207

Western blotting technique showed lack of an ACE2-specific band in total protein

208

extract obtained from ACE2 -/- animals (results not shown). Therefore, these sections

209

were also used for double immunolabeling experiments with ACE2 antibody and

210

results showed that, as expected, GnRH-positive cells were negative for ACE2 in

211

tissue sections from the knock-out animals (Fig. 2 I-L).

215

DISCUSSION

216
217

Our experiments confirmed the locations and approximate numbers of GnRH-positive

218

neurons of the nervus terminalis in rodents (Schwanzel-Fukuda et al., 1986; Wirsig

219

and Leonard, 1986; Schwanzel-Fukuda et al., 1987). In mouse, we found that the

220

number of CHAT-positive neurons was about half of the number of GnRH-positive

221

neurons. Interestingly, the large majority of GnRH-positive neurons also expressed

222

ACE2, while only a small fraction of CHAT-positive neurons co-localized ACE2.

223

Previous studies have suggested that the CHAT-positive neurons more often were

224

multipolar and possibly associated with an autonomic function, such as innervating

225

Bowman glands, while GnRH-positive neurons were thought to be sensory and/or may

226

have neurosecretory functions (Wirsig and Leonard, 1986; Schwanzel-Fukuda et al.,

227

1986).

228
229

Mice have been most often used as model systems for ACE2 expression, for

230

localization of SARS-CoV-2 in the olfactory epithelium, and to study neuro-invasion of

231

the brain along the olfactory route (Butowt and von Bartheld, 2020; Cooper et al., 2020;

232

Rathnasinghe et al., 2020). Mice have the advantage that a large number of mutants

233

are available (Butowt and von Bartheld, 2020), but they normally express an ACE2

234

version that binds SARS-CoV-2 with low affinity (Damas et al., 2020). Therefore, to

235

study SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice, a mouse-adapted virus has to be used (Leist et

236

al., 2020), or mice have to be engineered to express human ACE2.

237
238

Importantly, our finding of ACE2 expression in the large majority of GnRH-expressing

239

nervus terminalis neurons suggests that this cranial nerve is a more plausible conduit

240

for brain infection than the olfactory neurons that entirely or for the most part lack ACE2

241

expression (Butowt and von Bartheld, 2020; Cooper et al., 2020). The nervus terminalis

242

neurons may obtain the SARS-CoV-2 directly from infected cells in Bowman’s glands,

243

or through free nerve endings within the olfactory epithelium, many parts of which

244

degenerate when sustentacular cells are infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Bryche et al.,

245

2020). As illustrated in Fig. 4, the nervus terminalis thus has multiple venues to bind

246

the virus, while the lack of ACE2 in olfactory receptor neurons appears to be a barrier

247

to virus transfer.

249

Another important aspect is that the timeline of appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in the

250

brain fits the nervus terminalis projections, with an explosive appearance of the virus

251

in the forebrain in some mouse models (Winkler et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020; Zhou

252

et al., 2020; Carossino et al., 2021), rather than a gradual transfer along the olfactory

253

projections as would be expected from a virus that gains access to the brain via

254

olfactory projections (Barnett and Perlman, 1993). The nervus terminalis has direct

255

projections into the forebrain, reaching as far caudal as the hypothalamus (von

256

Bartheld, 2004), and this could explain why the virus reaches the brain and

257

cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces much faster than seems possible via “neuron

258

hopping” along olfactory projections. Most of the virus-containing axons in the olfactory

259

nerve demonstrated by Melo et al. (2020) do not express olfactory marker protein,

260

suggesting that they are not axons belonging to olfactory receptor neurons, and

261

therefore may be nervus terminalis axons which also project through the olfactory

262

nerve (Larsell, 1950).

263
264

On a comparative note, since dolphins and whales have a much larger number of

265

nervus terminalis cells than any other vertebrates (Oelschläger et al., 1987), and these

266

marine mammals express ACE2 that is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection

267

(Damas et al., 2020), our finding of ACE2 in nervus terminalis cells suggests that these

268

animals may be more vulnerable to brain infection via the nervus terminalis – even in

269

the absence of an olfactory system.

270
271

In humans, the number of nervus terminalis neurons is relatively small (a few hundred

272

to a few thousand neurons depending on age, Brookover, 1917; Larsell, 1950; Jin et

273

al., 2019). However, such a relatively small number may be sufficient to mediate viral

274

infection, especially considering that the nervus terminalis directly innervates secretory

275

cells of the Bowman’s glands (Larsell, 1950) that are known to express ACE2 (Brann

276

et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Cooper et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020;

277

Klingenstein et al., 2021) and readily become infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Ye et al.,

278

2020; Leist et al., 2020; Meinhardt et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020)

279

(Fig. 4). In addition, the nervus terminalis has many free nerve endings within the

280

olfactory epithelium (Larsell, 1950) – an epithelium that is heavily damaged when

281

ACE2-expressing sustentacular cells become infected and degenerate (Bryche et al.,
10

282

2020). Finally, a major component of the nervus terminalis innervates blood vessels

283

below the olfactory epithelium and projects via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-containing

284

spaces (Larsell, 1950; Jennes, 1987). Some nervus terminalis neurons have direct

285

projections to the hypothalamus (Pearson, 1941; Larsell, 1950; von Bartheld, 2004), a

286

brain region that may serve as a hub for virus spread throughout the brain (Nampoothiri

287

et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020).

288
289

Another argument to consider the nervus terminalis as an alternative to the olfactory

290

route is that neuro-invasion in most animal models is highly variable, even in the same

species and transgenic model (Jiang et al., 2020; Oladunni et al., 2020; Rathnasinghe

292

et al., 2020; Winkler et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020),

293

and this is despite a very consistent olfactory system in terms of numbers of neurons,

294

gene expression and projections. The nervus terminalis, on the other hand, is known

295

for its unusually large variability between individuals of the same species or even when

296

comparing the right side with the left side of the same individual (Larsell, 1918; Jin et

297

al., 2019). Such numerical differences can approach or even exceed an entire order of

298

magnitude (Schwanzel-Fukuda et al., 1987; Jin et al., 2019) – and thus may explain

299

the reported large variability in neuro-invasion along this route. Taken together, nervus

300

terminalis neurons, for the above reasons, should be considered as a plausible

301

alternative to the olfactory projections for neuro-invasion of SARS-CoV-2 from the

302

nose to the brain in COVID-19.

CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIELD

312
313

The new coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic can infect the brain in

314

humans and in some animal models. It is currently not known how this virus infects the

315

brain. Many researchers believe that the virus enters the brain by using a route along

316

the olfactory nerve. However, the olfactory neurons in the nose do not express the

317

obligatory virus entry receptor, and the timing of arrival and transfer of the virus in brain

318

targets is inconsistent with a neuronal transfer along olfactory projections. Here we

319

show that an alternative route for the new coronavirus to infect the brain is more

320

plausible. We show that many nervus terminalis neurons express the obligatory virus

321

entry protein. Since these neurons have direct contact with cells known to become

322

infected in the nose, and have direct projections to various targets in the forebrain, the

323

nervus terminalis neurons provide an alternative route for the new coronavirus to gain

324

access from the nose to the brain.

Fig. 4. Peripheral projections of nervus terminalis (NT) neurons and their

585

presumptive relationship with ACE2-expressing neurons in the olfactory epithelium

586

and known SARS-CoV-2 infection. NT neurons innervate blood vessels (BV),

587

Bowman gland (BG) cells, and the olfactory epithelium (OE). Peripheral projections of

588

NT neurons according to Larsell (1950). Cells expressing ACE2 are indicated in

589

green, including sustentacular cells (SUS) and BG cells. Both of these cell types

590

have been shown to express ACE2 (Bilinska et al., 2020; Brann et al., 2020; Chen et

591

al., 2020; Ye et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Klingenstein et al., 2021). Cell types

592

that have been documented to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 are indicated with pink

593

asterisks. SARS-CoV-2 localization in SUS cells according to Bryche et al., 2020; de
