Abstract

20

SARS-CoV-2 is the etiologic agent of COVID-19, currently causing a devastating pandemic for which

21

pharmacological interventions are urgently needed. The virus enters host cells through an interaction

22

between the spike glycoprotein and the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Directly

23

preventing this interaction presents an attractive possibility for suppressing SARS-CoV-2 replication.

24

Here we report the isolation and characterization of an alpaca-derived single domain antibody fragment,

25

Ty1, that specifically targets the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, directly

26

preventing ACE2 engagement. The nanobody binds with high affinity in the low nM range to the RBD,

27

occluding ACE2. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bound complex at 2.9 Å resolution reveals

28

that Ty1 binds to an epitope on the RBD accessible in both the ‘up’ and ‘down’ conformations and that Ty1

29

sterically hinders RBD-ACE2 binding. This 12.8 kDa nanobody does not need an Fc domain to neutralize

30

SARS-CoV-2, and can be expressed in high quantities in bacteria, presenting opportunities for

31

manufacturing at scale. Ty1 is therefore an excellent candidate as an intervention against COVID-19.

Main

34

SARS-CoV-2 emerged as the etiologic agent of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China in late 2019. In the

35

comparatively short time since then, it has achieved pandemic status, causing more than 7.3 million cases,

36

leading to at least 414,000 deaths and rising. Accordingly, the WHO declared the pandemic to be a public

37

health emergency of international concern. A safe and effective vaccine is urgently needed, but requires

38

time to develop. In the meantime, and indeed also in the post-vaccine era, highly specific and potent

39

antiviral interventions are needed. Many generic or repurposed candidates are in trials, but so far results

40

have been unremarkable. Since the virus is newly emerged, specifically designed drugs have not yet

41

reached late phase trials. When available, specific antiviral drugs or antibody therapies will be used to

42

protect individuals at risk and their widespread use will allow immunologically naïve populations to exit

43

lockdowns more safely.

44
45

The virus is closely related to SARS-CoV-1, both being members of the lineage 2 betacoronaviruses. Cell

46

entry of both viruses is achieved by first binding to the cell surface expressed receptor angiotensin-

47

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), followed by conformational changes in the viral spike glycoprotein trimer

48

and subsequent membrane fusion. The affinity of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) for

49

ACE2 is considerably higher than that for SARS-CoV-11,2, supporting efficient cell entry and likely

50

contributing to pathogenesis. The RBD is a globular domain situated on the distal surface of the spike

51

protein. Two conformations have been observed in the stabilized trimer. Specifically, one conformation

52

where one RBD is ACE2-accessible while two are not and one conformation where all three RBDs are

53

down, i.e. receptor inaccessible2,3. As the receptor-engaging part of the spike, the RBD is an attractive

54

target for coronavirus neutralization, and a number of conventional neutralizing monoclonal antibodies

55

that target the RBD and block receptor binding have already been isolated from convalescent patients4–6.

56
57

Camelid-derived single domain antibody fragments, also called VHHs or nanobodies, offer several

58

advantages over conventional antibodies as candidates for specific therapies. Despite being approximately

59

one tenth of the size of a conventional antibody, they retain specificity and affinity similar to conventional

60

antibodies while being far easier to clone, express and manipulate. They are readily expressed in bacteria

61

in large quantities and show high thermal stability and solubility, making them easily scalable and

62

extremely cost effective. Their modularity means that they can be oligomerized to increase avidity or to

63

increase serum half-life7. Critical to their use as antivirals in humans, they can easily be humanized with

64

existing protocols8. Importantly, they have proven to be highly potent inhibitors of viral infections in

65

vivo, particularly respiratory infections9,10.

67

We immunized one alpaca with SARS-CoV-2 S1-Fc and RBD in a 60-day immunization schedule. We

68

generated a phage display library and performed two consecutive rounds of phage display, followed by an

69

ELISA-based binding screen (Fig. 1a). We isolated one nanobody, Ty1, that binds specifically to the

70

RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. In parallel we performed next generation sequencing

71

(NGS) on the baseline and post-enrichment libraries, and quantified variant frequency before and after

72

each enrichment step. Ty1 exhibited the greatest fold-change in frequency among all nanobody variants,

73

increasing over 10,000-fold from baseline to after the second enrichment round (Fig.1b). We report the

74

amino acid sequence of Ty1 in Figure 1c.

75

To determine whether Ty1 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 we employed an in vitro neutralization assay using

76

lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Ty1 neutralized SARS-CoV-2

77

pseudotyped viruses at an IC50 of 0.77 µg/ml (54 nM) (Fig. 2a). No neutralization of a lentivirus

78

pseudotyped with VSV-G by Ty1 was evident, and a control nanobody produced and purified in the same

79

way, but specific for influenza A virus nucleoprotein11 showed no evidence of neutralization of SARS-

80

CoV-2 pseudotyped viruses. When Ty1 was expressed in mammalian cells as a Fc-fusion protein the

81

potent neutralization could be further increased to ~5 ng/ml (Fig. S1).

82

To confirm that Ty1 is directed specifically against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we characterized the

83

specificity of Ty1 by flow cytometry. We site-specifically conjugated a fluorophore to the C-terminus of

84

Ty1 by means of a Sortase A reaction and copper-free click chemistry (Ty1-AS635P) and stained

85

untransfected cells and cells transiently transfected with SARS-CoV-2 spike under permeabilizing

86

conditions (Fig. 2b). While untransfected and unstained cells displayed similar signals, cells expressing

87

the viral spike protein showed a strong shift in fluorescence intensity when stained with Ty1-AS635P.

88

The apparent double peak likely reflected the varying efficiency of this transient transfection. To

89

determine if the same probe can be exploited to recognize the viral spike protein in immunofluorescence,

90

we infected Vero E6 cells with infectious SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 1 for 24 hours and stained the fixed and

91

permeabilized cells with Ty1-AS635P and anti-dsRNA antibody (Fig. 2c). While uninfected cells showed

92

no signal, infected cells were strongly labelled with both dsRNA antibody and Ty1-AS635P. Thus, Ty1

93

recognized the viral spike glycoprotein with high specificity in its native conformation in SARS-CoV-2-

94

infected cells. Importantly, the low background in both experiments also suggested that Ty1 is a highly

95

specific and suitable tool for research, diagnostics and therapy.

96

To understand the mechanism of neutralization, we evaluated the effect of Ty1 on RBD binding to ACE2.

97

We site-specifically conjugated a fluorophore to the C-terminus of the RBD (RBD-AS635P) and used this

98

probe to stain ACE2 expressing HEK293T cells (Fig. 2d). Preincubation of RBD-AS635P with unlabeled

99

Ty1 resulted in a significant reduction of ACE2 staining, while preincubation with the control nanobody

100

NP-VHH1 had no such effect. This result indicated that Ty1 directly prevents binding of SARS-CoV-2

101

RBD to its host cell receptor ACE2.

102

Specific and high-affinity binding of Ty1 to the RBD was also demonstrated in kinetic bio layer

103

interferometry (BLI) experiments. Dipping of surface-immobilized nanobodies into monomeric RBD

104

solutions at 550 nM yielded binding responses with fast association kinetics and amplitudes reaching 1.5

105

nm only for Ty1 but not NP-VHH1 (red and blue curves, respectively, in Figure 3a). Titration

106

experiments performed under normal (280 mM) and high salt (680 mM) conditions revealed

107

concentration-dependent kinetic response curves for binding of RBD to Ty1 (Figs. 3b and S2a,

108

respectively). The derived semi-log concentration-response curves revealed sigmoidal line-shapes with

109

fitted apparent KD-values of 8 ± 1.5 and 13 ± 1.5 nm for binding at normal and high salt conditions,

110

respectively. Local fits to individual sensorgrams applying the standard 1:1 binding model appeared

111

reasonable for the association phases at lower to intermediate RBD concentrations, as well as for all

112

dissociation curves when fits were allowed to stay above zero (grey lines Figs. 3b and S2a 1st panel).

113

However, the model deviated from the observed data at higher RBD concentrations. Instead almost

114

perfect fits were obtained when the same data were analyzed in terms of a Bayesian two-dimensional

115

distribution of KD and koff-rate constants to address heterogeneous ligand site populations on the sensor

116

surface12–14. For the two titrations at low and high salt conditions, distinct peaks at KD- and koff-rate values

117

of 5-9 nM and 4-5*10-3 s-1 were obtained (Fig. 3b and S2a 4th panel). In both conditions, a second

118

elevated plateau with KD- and koff-rate values of about 7 nM and 1-4*10-7 contributed significantly to the

119

observed sensorgrams. Since most high-affinity protein-protein interactions in the nM-range have

120

dissociation rates in the 1*10-3 s−1 range15, we attribute the first defined peak as the relevant Ty1:RBD

121

interaction. The second broad plateau is likely caused by RBD competition and rebinding effects on the

122

sensor surface, as well as heterogeneous ligand populations14,16,17. The orthogonal biophysical method

123

isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)18 confirmed the high affinity binding of Ty1 to RBD with a KD of 9

124

nM (with estimated bounds of 1 and 70 nM) characterized by an exothermic enthalpy of about -10 ± 0.5

125

kcal/mole (Fig. 3c, left panel). Exothermic binding was already evident from the three initial relatively

126

constant negative spikes that were caused by the injection of Ty1 to RBD (Fig. 3c, right panel). The

127

amplitude of the following three to four spikes returned to baseline demonstrating saturation of the

128

available RBD sites by Ty1 binding. Notably, return to baseline was accompanied by the appearance of

129

preceding positive spikes (Fig. 3c, left panel and Fig. S2b). These spikes were also detected when Ty1

130

was injected into the buffer (HBS) and thus treated as Ty1 dilution effects during data analysis. Injection

131

of NP-VHH1 into RBD did not cause any binding or dilution heat changes above background noise. It

132

should be noted that the ITC measurements were performed at the lowest possible protein concentrations

133

to derive KD-values in the low nM range, while still being able to detect interaction heat above

134

background noise signals that were at about -0.17 ucal/s (maximum spike amplitude) and ± 0.05 ucal/s,

135

respectively. Altogether, we concluded from these results that RBD bound to surface-immobilized Ty1

136

with high affinity of about 5-10 nM.

137
138

To understand the structural basis underlying the potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 we performed a

139

cryo-EM structure determination of the prefusion-stabilized spike ectodomain in complex with Ty1. The

140

cryo-EM reconstruction reaches an overall resolution of 2.9 Å (Fig. 4a; 0.143 FSC) with strong variation

141

of estimated local resolution from high resolution in the core of the spike trimer to relatively low

142

resolution in the top of the spike. Nevertheless, the current reconstruction clearly shows that the spike

143

retains only one main conformation with one RBD ‘up’ and two RBDs ‘down’. Importantly, all three

144

RBDs are decorated in their upper parts with a Ty1 nanobody. The nanobodies retain a similar binding

145

orientation to the RBD whether the RBD is found in the ‘up’ or ‘down’ conformation (Fig. 4a,b). Primary

146

interactions with the RBD are through the CDRs. Specifically, CDR1 interacts with RBD T470 and

147

V483-E484 and CDR3 interacts with RBD Y449, F490 and Q493. Interestingly, CDR2 does not form any

148

interactions with the RBD, instead it stabilizes the conformation of CDR1 in the RBD bound mode and

149

thereby acts indirectly to potentiate the Ty1-RBD binding.

150
151

Since ACE2 can only be bound by an RBD in the ‘up’ conformation, the current cryo-EM reconstruction

152

clearly shows that ACE2 binding is sterically hindered from two sides (Fig. 4c). Specifically, ACE2

153

binding is blocked both by the Ty1 nanobody bound to the RBD in the ‘up’ conformation and the

154

neighboring RBD in the ‘down’ conformation. Hence, ACE2 binding is sufficiently hindered with any

155

two of the available three binding RBD sites in the spike trimer.

156
157

The current coronavirus pandemic has drastic consequences for the world’s population, and vaccines,

158

antibodies or antivirals are urgently needed. Neutralizing antibodies can block virus entry at an early step

159

of infection and potentially protect individuals that are at high risk of developing severe disease. We

160

report the identification and characterization of a SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific single domain antibody

161

fragment (nanobody) termed Ty1 that potently neutralizes the virus. We identified Ty1 by binding assay

162

after two consecutive rounds of phage display, simultaneously monitoring sequence enrichment by NGS.

163

Although Ty1 exhibited the greatest fold-enrichment in the NGS analysis, multiple additional nanobodies

164

exhibited enrichment of varying extent across both rounds. As the correlation between phage display

165

enrichment and neutralization is likely imperfect, further analyses of our libraries will likely yield other

166

potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing nanobodies. In addition to neutralization activity, we also show that Ty1

167

can be used as a detection reagent in flow cytometry and immunofluorescence demonstrating its

168

suitability as a research tool and for diagnostics.

169
170

It should be noted that the nanobody Ty1 can be readily produced in bacteria at very high yield (in excess

171

of 30 mg/L culture), making it an excellent candidate for a low-cost, scalable antiviral agent against

172

SARS-CoV-2, and we provide the amino acid sequence, encouraging direct exploitation as such. While

173

nanobodies capable of binding SARS-CoV-2 spike have recently been isolated, these were generated after

174

SARS-CoV-1 spike immunization19, or PCR maturation20. Also, in both cases a fusion to human Fc

175

domain is required for neutralization of SARS-CoV-2, precluding expression in bacterial culture. Naive

176

libraries of human single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) have also been screened to identify SARS-CoV-2

177

spike-specific nanobodies21,22, but they lack detailed structural information. Ty1 represents the first

178

single-domain antibody isolated from an animal specifically immunized with a SARS-CoV-2 protein.

179
180

Future work will aim to improve the potency and potential efficacy of Ty1 through various strategies. For

181

example, mutational scanning may yield potency improvements to Ty1. Also, since Ty1 already

182

neutralizes as a monomeric protein, the generation of homodimeric or trimeric fusion constructs is

183

expected to further increase its neutralization activity. Indeed, fusion of Ty1 to a human IgG1-Fc

184

dramatically improved the IC50 of this molecule, to approximately 5 ng/ml (Fig. S2). Additional strategies

185

will explore linker-based constructs that chain multiple copies of Ty1 together, which may provide

186

similar improvements in potency while retaining the possibility of being expressed in bacteria. Ty1 may

187

additionally be a useful component of a bi-specific or tri-specific antibody, which could combine epitope

188

specificities to increase the mutational barrier to viral escape. Based on our work, we hope that Ty1 will

189

be investigated as a candidate for antiviral therapy.

Methods

192

Cells and virus. Vero E6 cells (ATCC-CRL-1586) and HEK293T cells (ATCC-CRL-3216) were

193

maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and

194

1% Penicillin-Streptomycin and cultured at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. A HEK293T

195

cell line engineered to overexpress human ACE2 (HEK293T-ACE2) was generated by the lentiviral

196

transduction of HEK293T cells. Briefly, lentiviruses were produced by co-transfecting HEK293T cells

197

with a plasmid encoding VSV-G (Addgene cat#12259), a lentiviral Gag-Pol packaging plasmid (Addgene

198

cat#8455), and a human ACE2 transfer plasmid. Virions were harvested from the supernatant, filtered

199

through 0.45 µm filters, and used to transduce HEK293T cells. All cell lines used for experiments were

negative for Mycoplasma as determined by PCR. Infectious SARS-CoV-223 was propagated in Vero E6

201

cells and titrated by plaque assay.

202
203

Proteins and probes. The plasmid for expression of the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized spike

204

ectodomain with a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization motif was obtained from2. The plasmid was used

205

to transiently transfect FreeStyle 293F cells using FreeStyle MAX reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

206

The S ectodomain was purified from filtered supernatant on Streptactin XT resin (IBA Lifesciences),

207

followed by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 in 5 mM Tris pH 8, 200 mM NaCl.

208

The RBD domain (RVQ – VNF) of SARS-CoV-2 was cloned upstream of an enterokinase cleavage site

209

and a human Fc. This plasmid was used to transiently transfect FreeStyle 293F cells using the FreeStyle

210

MAX reagent. The RBD-Fc fusion was purified from filtered supernatant on Protein G Sepharose (GE

211

Healthcare). The protein was cleaved using bovine enterokinase (GenScript) leaving a FLAG-tag at the

212

C-terminus of the RBD. Enzyme and Fc-portion was removed on HIS-Pur Ni-NTA resin (Thermo Fisher

213

Scientific) and Protein G sepharose (GE Healthcare) respectively, and the RBD was purified by size-

214

exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 in 50 mM Tris pH 8, 200 mM NaCl.

215

In addition, the RBD domain (RVQ – VNF) was cloned upstream of a Sortase A recognition site

216

(LPETG) and a 6xHIS tag and expressed in FreeStyle 293F cells as described above. RBD-HIS was

217

purified from filtered supernatant on His-Pur Ni-NTA resin, followed by size-exclusion chromatography

218

on a Superdex 200.

219

The nanobodies were cloned for expression in the pHEN plasmid with a C-terminal Sortase recognition

220

site (LPETG) and a 6xHIS tag. This plasmid was used to transform BL21 cells for periplasmic

221

expression. Expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG at OD600 = 0.6; cells were grown overnight at

222

30°C. Nanobodies were retrieved from the periplasm by osmotic shock and purified by Ni-NTA affinity

223

purification and size-exclusion chromatography.

224

For mammalian expression, the sequence encoding the nanobody Ty1 was cloned upstream of an human

225

IgG1. This plasmid was used to transiently transfect FreeStyle 293F cells using the FreeStyle MAX

226

reagent. The Ty1-Fc fusion was purified from filtered supernatant on Protein G Sepharose followed by

227

size-exclusion chromatography.

228

Biotinylated and fluorescent probes were generated using Sortase A as described here24 and here25. In

229

brief, nanobodies were site-specifically biotinylated on the C-terminus using Sortase A 5M. Nanobody at

230

a concentration of 50 μM was incubated with sortase A 5M (5 μM), GGGK-biotin (200 μM) in 50 mM

231

Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, for 2 hours at 25°C. Unreacted nanobody and sortase was

232

removed with Ni-NTA resin and excess GGGK-biotin was removed using Zeba spin desalting columns

233

(0.5 mL, 7k MWCO, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

234

To generate the fluorescently labeled probes, first a dibenzocyclooctyne-amine (DBCO-amine, Sigma

235

Aldrich) was attached via sortase A to the nanobody or the RBD. (Reaction conditions: 50 μM RBD or

236

nanobody, 50 μM Sortase A 5M, 8 mM DBCO-amine in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM

237

CaCl2, 2 hours, 25°C). Unreacted probe, sortase and excess DBCO-amine was removed using Ni-NTA

238

resin and PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare) respectively. Abberior Star 635P-azide (Abberior GMBH) was

239

attached to the DBCO-labeled proteins in a copper-free click chemistry reaction. Unreacted fluorophore

240

was removed on PD-10 column (RBD) or size-exclusion chromatography (nanobody).

241

Alpaca immunization. Alpaca immunization and phage display was performed similarly as described

242

here26 and here27. In brief, the adult male alpaca Tyson at PreClinics, Germany, was immunized 4 times in

243

a 60-day immunization schedule. SARS-CoV-2 S1-sheep-Fc (Native Antigen Company, SKU:

244

REC31806) was used for the first two immunization, and SARS-CoV-2 RBD produced in FreeStyle 293F

245

cells was used for the last two immunizations.

246
247

Library generation and nanobody isolation. After the final boost, RNA was isolated from PBMCs

248

(RNA Plus mini kit, Qiagen). For cDNA synthesis, SuperScript III RT (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was

249

used with a combination of oligo(dT), random hexamers, or gene specific primers (AL.CH2,

250

ATGGAGAGGACGTCCTTGGGT and AL.CH2.2 TTCGGGGGGAAGAYRAAGAC)27. Nanobody

251

sequences were PCR amplified and cloned into a phagemid vector for expression as pIII fusion. TG1 cells

252

(Lucigen) were transformed with this library by electroporation.

253

Cells were inoculated with VCSM13 helper phage, and the resulting phage was enriched in two

254

consecutive rounds of phage display on RBD immobilized on magnetic beads. After the second round of

255

phage display, individual bacterial colonies were picked in a 96 well format, grown until OD = 0.6 and

256

nanobody expression was induced by addition of 1 mM IPTG. After 16 hours incubation at 30°C,

257

bacterial supernatant was used as primary detection reagent in an ELISA coated with RBD or S

258

ectodomain. Bound nanobodies were detected with anti-E tag (Bethyl laboratories) secondary antibody.

259

Positive clones were sequenced and cloned into the pHEN expression vector for further characterization.

Next generation sequencing (NGS) and analysis of nanobody libraries. Plasmids from nanobody

265

libraries before enrichment, and after each enrichment step, were amplified for 13 cycles using Q5 High-

266

Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB) according to manufacturer's instructions, using primers:

267

CACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCTCTCGCGGCCCAGCCGGCCATGG and

268

GGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTACCGGCGCACCACTAGTGCA, annealing at 72°C.

269

Illumina indexing primers were added using an additional 9 cycles, with Kapa HiFi. Amplicons were size

270

selected using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (bead ratio: 1:1), and were pooled at ratios of 6:2:1 for

271

pre:post-1:post-2 libraries, to account for the reduction in diversity expected during enrichment, and

272

sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq using the MiSeq Reagent Kit v3 (2x300) MS-102-3003.

273

Paired-end reads were merged using USEARCH1128, and then processed in the Julia language, primarily

274

using the NextGenSeqUtils.jl package29. Briefly, reads are trimmed of primer sequences, and

275

deduplicated, maintaining read frequencies. Variant frequencies are calculated as combined frequency of

276

any reads matching a variant within 3% nucleotide divergence, using a kmer-based distance

277

approximation for rapid database search. Any reads with counts >3 from the second enrichment library

278

are searched for their variant frequencies across all databases. When calculating enrichment, to avoid

279

zeros due to sampling and to regularize against over-sensitivity to low-frequency baseline variants, all

280

frequencies are increased by the reciprocal of the size of the pre-enrichment database.

281

Neutralization Assay. Pseudotyped viruses were generated by the co-transfection of HEK293T cells with

282

plasmids encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein harbouring an 18 amino acid truncation of the

283

cytoplasmic tail30, a plasmid encoding firefly luciferase, and a lentiviral packaging plasmid (Addgene

284

cat#8455) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen). Media was changed 12-16 hours after transfection, and

285

pseudotyped viruses were harvested at 48- and 72-hours post transfection, filtered through a 0.45 µm

286

filter, and stored at -80°C until use. Pseudotyped virus neutralization assays were adapted from protocols

287

previously validated to characterize the neutralization of HIV 31, but with the use of HEK293T-ACE2

288

cells. Briefly, pseudotyped viruses sufficient to generate ~100,000 RLUs were incubated with serial

289

dilutions of nanobodies for 60 min at 37°C. Approximately 15,000 HEK293T-ACE2 cells were then

290

added to each well and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 hours. Luminescence was then measured

291

using Bright-Glo (Promega) per the manufacturer’s instructions on a GM-2000 luminometer (Promega)

292

with an integration time of 0.3s.

Flow Cytometry. Cells were trypsinized and fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS and stained with RBD-

295

AS635P under non-permeabilizing conditions or with Ty1-AS635P under permeabilizing conditions.

296

Fluorescence was quantified using a BD FACSCelesta and the FlowJo software package.

297
298

Immunofluorescence. Vero E6 cells were seeded onto coverslips in a 24-well plate and incubated

299

overnight at 37°C/5% CO2. Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a MOI of 1 for 24 h. Cells were

300

fixed with 4% (v/v) formaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 and blocked in 5% horse serum.

301

Cells were incubated with anti-dsRNA antibody (1:2000, J2 Scicons) for 1 hour at room temperature

302

followed by 1 hour staining with the secondary antibody anti-mouse-Alexa Fluor 488 (1:2000, Thermo

303

Fisher Scientific), Hoechst (1:1000, Invitrogen) and Ty1-AS635P (0.05 µg/mL). Coverslips were

304

mounted in mounting media and images were obtained using Zeiss Axiovert microscope and processed

305

using Adobe Photoshop.

306
307

Biophysical Biolayer interferometry (BLI) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). BLI was

308

performed using single-use high-precision streptavidin biosensors (SAX) on an eight-channel Octet RED

309

instrument according to manufacturer’s protocols (Fortebio)16. Assays were performed in 2xPBS

310

comprising 0,05% Tween-20 (PBST). Biotinylated nanobodies Ty1 and NP-VHH1 were loaded at

311

concentrations between 30 and 250 nM followed by quenching using biocytin to reach final sensor loads

312

of between 0.15 and 0.7 nm. For the comparative binding test, the eight sensors were divided into two

313

sets, each comprising double sample as well as single reference and single control sensors. Sample and

314

reference sensors were loaded with respective nanobodies. The SAX control was only quenched. Loading

315

of the two sets was performed consecutively to reach similar immobilization levels, while subsequent

316

association and dissociation phases were performed simultaneously. For association, the sample and

317

control sensors were dipped into RBD, while the reference sensor was dipped into PBST. For titration

318

experiments, all sensors were loaded simultaneously. During association one of the sensors was used as

319

reference and only dipped into PBST. Raw data were pre-processed, analyzed and fitted by applying the

320

1:1 binding model as implemented in the manufacturer’s software. Bayesian analysis to obtain the two-

321

dimensional distribution of KD and koff -rate values were performed using Evilfit12–14. The shown titration

322

data were processed applying reference sensor subtraction and Savitzky-Golay filter operations.

323

For ITC, proteins were exchanged to 2xHBS-buffer (50 mM HEPES, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) and isolated

324

as single peak populations by Superdex-200 HR10/300 size-exclusion chromatography. ITC

325

measurements were performed using an ITC200 calorimeter (GE Healthcare). The cell temperature was

326

set to 37ºC and the syringe stirring speed to 750 rpm. Before each experiment, the RBD and nanobodies

327

were loaded into the cell and syringe at concentrations of 4 μM and 75 μM, respectively. Data and

328

binding parameters were analyzed using the MicroCal PeakITC software (Malvern). The integrated heat

329

versus molar ratio plots of the Ty1:RBD interactions were obtained by subtracting the Ty1 dilution heat

330

uptake from the binding data. The NP-VHH1:RBD data were only baseline-corrected, since dilution

331

effects were not evident.

332

Raw and processed BLI/ITC data were imported into Rstudio for visualization and further analysis32–34.

333

Data along with analysis R scripts will be made publicly available via Github and/or DataDryad.

334

Cryo-EM sample preparation and imaging. Spike trimer (0.7 mg/ml) and Ty1 (1.3 mg/ml) were mixed

335

in a 1:8 molar ratio and incubated on ice for 5 minutes. A 3-μl aliquot of the sample solution was applied

336

to glow-discharged CryoMatrix holey grids with amorphous alloy film (Zhenjiang Lehua Technology) in

337

a Vitrobot Mk IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4 degrees and 100% humidity (blot 10 s, blot force 3).

338

Cryo-EM data collection was performed with EPU 2.7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a Krios G3i

339

transmission-electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 300 keV in the Karolinska

340

Institutet 3D-EM facility. Images were acquired in nanoprobe EFTEM mode with a slit width of 10 eV

341

using a GIF 967 energy filter (Ametek) and a K3 detector (Ametek) during 2.4 seconds with a dose rate of

342

4.1 e-/px/s resulting in a total dose of 38 e-/Å2 fractionated into 40 movie frames. Motion correction, CTF-

343

estimation, fourier binning (to 1.02 Å/px), picking and extraction in 428 pixel boxes were performed on

344

the fly using Warp 35.

345

A total of 13,589 micrographs were selected based on an estimated resolution cutoff of 4 Å and defocus

346

below 2 microns. and 573,036 particles were picked by Warp. Extracted particles were imported into

347

cryoSPARC v2.15.036 for 2D classification, 3D classification and non-uniform 3D refinement. The

348

particles were processed with C1 symmetry throughout. After 2D classification (300 classes) 354,678

349

particles were retained and used to build three ab-initio 3D reconstructions. These were further processed

350

for heterogeneous refinement that resulted in one reconstruction showing high-resolution structural

351

features in the core of the spike. One round of homogenous refinement followed by non-uniform

352

refinement resulted in a final reconstruction to an overall resolution of 2.9 Å (0.143 FSC) using 210,832

353

particles. To minimise the effects of loss of delocalised information due to tight boxing37, the particles

354

were re-extracted with 600 pixel box size. In addition, localized reconstruction38 were performed using

355

particles where all parts of the spike except the N-terminal domains, the RBDs and the nanobodies had

356

been subtracted39. The combined effects of these three approaches significantly increased the level of

357

density detail in the upper part of the spike.

Model building and structure refinement. A structure of the 2019-nCoV spike protein trimer19 (PDB:

360

6VSB) was used as a starting model for model building. The model was extended and manually adjusted

361

in COOT40. The Nanobody structure was homology modelled using SWISS-MODEL41 taking

362

PDB:5JMR42 as a template. The missing regions of the RBD domains were built based on the RBD-

363

ACE2 crystal structure (PDB: 6LZG)43. Structure refinement and manual model building were performed

364

using COOT and PHENIX44 in interspersed cycles with secondary structure and geometry restrained. All

365

structure figures and all EM density-map figures were generated with UCSF ChimeraX45.

496

harboring the SARS-CoV-2 spike for 24 h. Cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained with Ty1-AS635P

497

(black and red) or left unstained (grey). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cell counts are presented

498

as % of max (representative histogram). c, Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a MOI of 1

499

for 24 hours. Cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained for DNA (blue), dsRNA (green) and with Ty1-

500

AS635P (red). Pictures were taken by fluorescence microscopy and representative examples are shown.

501

d, ACE2 expressing HEK293T cells were trypsinized, fixed and stained with RBD-AS635P alone, or

502

preincubated with IAV NP-VHH1 or Ty1. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry.

Figure 3 - RBD bound to Ty1 with 5-10 nM affinities in biophysical BLI and ITC measurements

506

a, RBD bound to surface-immobilized Ty1 (red curves), but not to NP-VHH1 (blue curves). Almost equal

507

nanobody immobilization levels of about 0.7 nm were obtained by first loading Ty1 and then NP-VHH1.

508

In BLI, binding of molecules over time is recorded as sensorgrams recording the shift in wavelengths

509

(unit: nm) due to an increase in the optical thickness of the surface layer. b, (1st panel) RBD titration

510

sensorgrams obtained at high salt concentrations revealed concentration-dependent responses.

511

Sensorgrams are color-coded according to the log2 RBD concentration scale. Standard and Bayesian 1:1

512

binding models are shown as grey and black solid lines. (2nd panel) Pseudo-equilibrium response values

513

plotted against the logarithmic RBD concentration revealed sigmoidal binding curves that were fit to the

514

single-site interaction model 46 yielding KD-values in the low nM range. KD-values and standard

515

deviations are shown as solid and dotted lines, respectively. (3rd panel) Sensor immobilization levels are

516

shown as jittered box plots. (4th panel) Two-dimensional distribution of dissociation rate (koff) and

517

affinity (KD) values obtained from the Bayesian and standard 1:1 model fits, visualized as densities

518

according to depicted normalized height scale and single black crosses, respectively. See related Figure

519

S2A. Plots for RBD/Ty1 titrations at low salt condition with same legends and scales. c, (1st panel) ITC

520

demonstrated high affinity binding of Ty1 to RBD with fitted KD– and binding enthalpy (DH) mean

521

values of 9 nM (with estimated bounds of 1 and 70 nM) and -10 ± 0.5 kcal/mole, respectively, for two

522

binding experiments (red). Injection of NP-VHH1 into RBD yielded heat changes at background level

523

(blue). (2nd panel) Baseline-corrected heat changes plotted for two Ty1/RBD, a single Ty1/HBS buffer

Figure 4 - Ty1 binds to the RBD in ‘up’ and ‘down’ conformation and prevents ACE2 engagement

530

a, Cryo-EM reconstruction to an overall resolution of 2.9 Å (0.143 FSC) of the spike trimer with three

531

bound molecules of Ty1. b, Atomic model (cartoon representation) of trimeric spike in complex with

532

three molecules of Ty1. Three chains of spike are shown in three different colors. The RBD of chain A

533

(light green) is present in ‘up’ conformation while the other two RBDs are captured in ‘down’

534

conformation. The ACE2 interaction surface of RBD1 and the Ty1 interaction surface is highlighted.

535

Magnified view of RBD2 (in ‘down’ conformation) and Ty1 interaction is shown. CDR1,2 and 3 of Ty1

536

are shown in blue, green and red respectively. c, Ty1 shows a two-pronged inhibition of ACE2 receptor

537

binding through binding the RBD in the ‘up’ conformation and by binding to the neighbouring RBD in

538

the ‘down’ conformation. Binding of Ty1 to RBDs (both ‘up’ and ‘down’) would make ACE2 interaction

539

surface inaccessible for ACE2.
