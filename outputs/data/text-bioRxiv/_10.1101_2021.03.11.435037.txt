Cryo-EM structures reveal changes in SARS-CoV-2 S protein during inter-species
transmission or immune evasion.
Adaptation to mink resulted in increased ACE2 binding and spike destabilization.
B.1.1.7 S mutations reveal an intricate balance of stabilizing and destabilizing effects
that impact receptor and antibody binding.
E484K mutation in B.1.351 and B.1.1.28 S proteins drives immune evasion by
altering RBD conformation.
S protein uses different mechanisms to converge upon similar solutions for altering
RBD up/down positioning.

Summary
New SARS-CoV-2 variants that have accumulated multiple mutations in the spike (S)
glycoprotein enable increased transmission and resistance to neutralizing antibodies. Here, we
study the antigenic and structural impacts of the S protein mutations from four variants, one that
was involved in transmission between minks and humans, and three that rapidly spread in human
populations and originated in the United Kingdom, Brazil or South Africa. All variants either
retained or improved binding to the ACE2 receptor. The B.1.1.7 (UK) and B.1.1.28 (Brazil)
spike variants showed reduced binding to neutralizing NTD and RBD antibodies, respectively,
while the B.1.351 (SA) variant showed reduced binding to both NTD- and RBD-directed
antibodies. Cryo-EM structural analyses revealed allosteric effects of the mutations on spike
conformations and revealed mechanistic differences that either drive inter-species transmission
or promotes viral escape from dominant neutralizing epitopes.

Introduction
The emergence of rapidly-spreading variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),
threatens to prolong an already devastating pandemic with unprecedented global health and
economic consequences. First identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, declared a Public
Health Emergency of International Concern in January 2020, and a pandemic in March 2020,
COVID-19 has claimed more than 2.5 million lives and infected more than 117 million people
world-wide (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu). Several vaccines are being deployed worldwide to gain
control of the pandemic (Baden et al., 2021; Chung et al., 2020; Polack et al., 2020), although
appearance of highly transmissible variants have caused concern (Galloway et al., 2021; Leung et
al., 2021) (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/variantsurveillance/variant-info.html). Some variants have exhibited resistance to neutralization by
antibodies and plasma from convalescent or vaccinated individuals, which together with their
fast spread have raised concerns that their resistance may render current vaccines ineffective
(Wang et al., 2021b; Wibmer et al., 2021). Additionally, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between
humans and animals has been observed, most notably in mink farms leading to the culling of
large populations of minks in Denmark and other countries to prevent establishment of a nonhuman reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 variants (Oude Munnink et al., 2021). Multiple synergizing
mutations in the spike (S) glycoprotein (Ke et al., 2020; Turonova et al., 2020) in these variants
are under scrutiny due to the S protein’s central role in engaging the angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to mediate cellular entry (Hoffmann et al., 2020a), and being the
primary target of neutralizing antibodies elicited either by vaccination or during natural infection
(Corbett et al., 2020; Sempowski et al., 2020).
The prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S protein trimer is composed of two subunits, S1 and S2,
separated by a furin cleavage site (Figure 1). The S1 subunit contains the N-terminal domain
(NTD), the ACE2 receptor binding domain (RBD), and two subdomains (SD1 and SD2). Both
the NTD and RBD are dominant targets for neutralizing antibodies (Barnes et al., 2020a; Barnes
et al., 2020b; Li et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2020). The RBD transitions between a “closed” or
“down” conformation that is inaccessible to ACE2 receptor and “open” or “up” conformation
that allows for recognition and binding to the host cell ACE2 receptor (Gui et al., 2017; Shang et
al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2017). We and others have previously shown that mutations in distal

regions of the S protein can have allosteric effects on the RBD up/down disposition (Gobeil et
al., 2021; Henderson et al., 2020; Yurkovetskiy et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). We have further
shown that SD1 and SD2 play essential roles in modulating spike allostery (Gobeil et al., 2021).
The S2 subunit contains a second protease cleavage site (S2’) for the protease TMPRSS2,
followed by the fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat 1 (HR1), the central helix (CH), the connector
domain (CD), heptad repeat 2 (HR2), the transmembrane domain (TM) and a cytoplasmic tail
(CT) (Figure 1). After binding the ACE2-receptor, and protease cleavage at the furin and
TMPRSS2 cleavage sites, the S protein undergoes large conformational changes leading to
cellular entry (Bestle et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020a; Hoffmann et al., 2020b; Matsuyama et
al., 2020).
Fall 2020 has been marked by the appearance of several neutralization-resistant and/or
highly infectious variants of SARS-CoV-2 with mutations in the S protein accumulating in the
background of the D614G variant that arose early in the pandemic and quickly became dominant
worldwide (Korber et al., 2020). Some S mutations recur in variants that originated
independently in different parts of the world, suggesting these mutations confer selective
advantages such as escape from vaccine induced or convalescent neutralizing antibodies. Here,
we determined structures and antigenicity of (1) a variant that was implicated in the transmission
between humans and minks (Koopmans, 2021), (2) the B.1.1.7 variant (20I/501Y.V1) that was
first detected in the United Kingdom (UK) and shares the N501Y mutation with the B.1.351 and
B.1.1.28 variants (Galloway et al., 2021; Leung et al., 2021), (3) the B.1.1.28 variant, first
reported in Japan in four travelers from Brazil and was a dominant driver of the early epidemic
phase in multiple Southeastern Brazilian states (Paiva et al., 2020), and (4) the B.1.351 variant
(20H/501Y.V2) that arose independently in South Africa, and shares three RBD mutations,
K417N, E484K, and N501Y, with the B.1.1.28 variant (Mwenda et al., 2021) (Figure 1). The
P.1 lineage (20J/501Y.V3) branched off the B.1.1.28 lineage, and has been identified in an
outbreak in a region in Brazil that had already seen approximately 75% of the population
infected with SARS-CoV-2 as of October 2020 (Sabino et al., 2021), thus raising concerns about
increase in propensity for SARS-CoV-2 re-infection of individuals. Here, we study the impact of
these SARS-CoV-2 mutations on the antigenicity and structure of the variant spike proteins, and
elucidate the structural mechanisms underlying the effects of these spike mutations on
transmissibility and immune evasion.

Results
SARS-CoV-2 S protein variant constructs, protein production and quality control
For the S ectodomain constructs described in this study, we used the previously described
S-GSAS-D614G S ectodomain template (Figure 1) (Gobeil et al., 2021). This construct includes
residues 1 to 1208 of SARS-CoV-2 S, a “RRAR” to “GSAS” substitution that renders the furin
cleavage site at the junction of the S1 and S2 subunits inactive, a foldon trimerization motif
appended at the C-terminus of the spike sequence that ensures formation of native-like spike
trimers in the absence of the transmembrane region, and a C-terminal TwinStrep tag for efficient
purification and S protein immobilization on solid support.
The S protein variants described in this study were expressed, purified and assessed
similarly, and as we have described previously (Edwards et al., 2021). All the purified S proteins
showed similar migration profiles on SDS-PAGE and SEC, with high-quality spike preparations
confirmed by negative stain electron microscopy (NSEM) (Figure 1, Supplemental Item 1).
NSEM reported between 78% and 91% prefusion spike trimers; the remaining particle picks
were classified as junk.
SARS-CoV-2 S protein variant with mink-associated cluster 5 mutations
Spillover of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to minks, and then from minks to humans was
first reported in April 2020 in the Netherlands, and since has also been independently reported in
Denmark, Spain, Italy, USA, Sweden, and Greece (Koopmans, 2021). This issue came into
public view in the fall 2020 when a decision to cull all (~ 17 million) minks in Denmark was
announced. Five S protein mutations were observed in SARS-CoV-2 transmitted from humans to
mink, and back to humans. This variant, termed “cluster 5”, includes a H69 (H69Δ) and V70
(V70Δ) deletion in the NTD, and amino acid mutations Y453F in the RBD, I692V located
downstream of the furin motif in SD2, and M1229I in the transmembrane domain. In the SARSCoV-2 S ectodomain context, we included the H69Δ, V70Δ, Y453F and I692V mutations,
referred to here as S-GSAS-D614G-ΔFV (Figure 1). The fifth “cluster 5” mutation (M1229I) in
the transmembrane region is not present in the ectodomain construct.

To understand the effect of the acquired mutations in the S ectodomain on its binding to
human ACE2 receptor, we measured binding of the S-GSAS-D614G-ΔFV ectodomain to the
recombinant human ACE2 protein by ELISA and SPR (Figure 2A, Supplemental Items 2-4).
By ELISA, ACE2 showed higher levels of binding to S-GSAS-D614G-ΔFV than to the SGSAS-D614G ectodomain (Supplemental Item 2A), and SPR showed a slower off-rate of
binding (Supplemental Item 2B).
Using single cycle kinetics, we measured a ~3.5-fold tighter affinity for ACE2 binding to
S-GSAS-D614G-ΔFV than to S-GSAS-D614G, and confirmed that the improved affinity was
contributed primarily by a decrease in off-rate (Figure 2A, Supplementary Table 1). To
deconvolute the effect of the different spike mutations, we measured ACE2 binding to S-GSASD614G-H69/V70Δ, S-GSAS-D614G-Y453F and S-GSAS-D614G-I692V (Supplemental Item
4). Of these, S-GSAS-D614G-Y453F showed a similar kinetics and affinity profile for ACE2
binding as the S-GSAS-D614G-ΔFV spike, thus implicating the Y453F mutation in the
enhanced ACE2 binding affinity of S-GSAS-D614G-ΔFV.
To understand the effect of the mutations on spike antigenicity, we measured binding
affinity and kinetics of S-GSAS-D614G-ΔFV to a panel of antibodies targeting different regions
of the spike (Figure 2A, Supplementary Table 1, Supplemental Items 3-4 ) (Acharya et al.,
2020; Li et al., 2021; Yuan et al., 2017). S-GSAS-D614G-ΔFV retained robust binding to RBDdirected neutralizing antibodies, DH1041, DH1043 and DH1047. We observed improved
binding affinity of S-GSAS-D614G-ΔFV compared to S-GSAS-D614G to the neutralizing NTDdirected antibodies DH1050.1 and DH1050.2 by 3.5 and 2.6-fold, respectively. This was
primarily a result of an increased on-rate, with the dominant contribution coming from the
H69/V70Δ mutation (Figure 2A, Supplemental Item 4). Thus, our binding studies showed that
inter-species adaptation involved enhancement of receptor binding affinity of the S protein
without evidence of escape from the dominant neutralization epitopes.
Cryo-EM structures of the S-GSAS-D614G-ΔFV ectodomain
To understand how the mutations acquired during interspecies transmission between
mink and humans affected S protein conformation, we determined cryo-EM structures of the SGSAS-D614G-ΔFV ectodomain. From the cryo-EM dataset, we classified and refined four 3RBD-down populations to overall resolutions of 2.8-3.2 Å, without imposing 3-fold symmetry,

and named them 3D-1, 3D-2, 3D-3 and 3D-4 (PDB 7LWK, 7LWL, 7LWI and 7LWJ
respectively) (Figure 2B). We also refined three 1-RBD-up populations, 1U-1, 1U-2 and 1U-3
(PDB 7LWM, 7LWN and 7LWO respectively), to resolutions of 2.8-2.9 Å, and one 2-RBD-up
population (2U; PDB 7LWP) to 3.0 Å (Figure 2C, Supplementary Table 2, Supplemental
Items 5 and 6). We identified a spike population, named M1, with two RBDs in “down”
position, and no density visible for the entire S1 subunit of the third protomer, both in the 3.2 Å
resolution reconstruction and the gaussian filtered map (Figure 2D, Supplementary Table 2,
Supplemental Items 5 and 6). Since SDS-PAGE did not show any evidence for proteolysis, the
absence of the S1 subunit density for one protomer suggests either shearing of this region from
the rest of the spike during cryo-EM specimen vitrification, or unfolding of this region.
To examine details of the structural variability, the refined maps were fitted with
coordinates. Overlay of the 3-RBD-down structures, using S2 residues 908-1035 of the HR1-CH
region for the superposition, revealed that in addition to the expected variation in the S1 subunits
(Gobeil et al., 2021), there was considerable variability in S2, including the region near the HR1CH hinge (Supplemental Item 7A). This variability was especially pronounced for the 3D-4
structure (Figure 2B and Supplemental Item 7). By contrast, superposition of the three 1-RBDup structures using residues 908-1035 yielded good structural alignment in the S2 subunit, with
the S1subunit showing variability, especially in mobile RBD and NTD regions (Supplemental
Item 8).
To obtain residue-level visualization of the differences between the structures, we
performed difference distance matrices (DDM) analysis (Richards and Kundrot, 1988). DDM
analyses provide superposition-free comparisons between a pair of structures by calculating the
differences between the distances of each pair of Ca atoms in a structure and the corresponding
pair of Ca atoms in a second structure. In our analysis, we first compared each protomer with the
other two protomers within the same spike, and next, compared each protomer to the protomers
from the other 3-RBD-down structures (Figure 2B and Supplemental Item 7). The DDM
analysis revealed that 3D-4 was the most asymmetric of the four 3-RBD-down structures, with
large variations in the S1 subunit between its three protomer, especially in the mobile NTD and
RBD regions. In addition, 3D-4 was also most different from the other three 3-RBD-down
structure with large differences in the S2 region. The variation in the S2 region between different
pre-fusion structures was unexpected since in prior studies the S2 subunit had appeared relatively

invariable, with variability mostly contained within the S1 subunit. By contrast, the DDM
analysis of the 1-up structures showed large movements in the S1 subunits, but little change in
the S2 subunit, similar to prior observations with other 1-RBD-up structures, including of the SGSAS-D614G spike (Supplemental Item 8) (Gobeil et al., 2021).
Vector Analysis of the S-GSAS- D614G-ΔFV ectodomain structures
We next analyzed the S1 and S2 domain dispositions within each protomer via
calculation of our previously described vector relations (Figure 2E-I) (Henderson et al., 2020).
Principal components analysis (PCA) of the intra-protomer angles and distances for the down
state protomers revealed protomers from the 3D-4 structure formed a distinct cluster, consistent
with the DDM analysis that showed 3D-4 to be a distinct structure, different from the other 3RBD-down structures (Figure 2F). The two protomers from the M1 structure, with their RBDs
in the down position, displayed similarity to the 3D-1 protomers along the primary component,
while the 3D-3 chain C protomer closely matched the M1 chain C protomer and the 3D-1 chain
A protomer closely matched the M1 chain A structure.
The I692V mutation in the S-GSAS-D614G-ΔFV ectodomain occurs in SD2, a region we
had previously shown to be a conformational anchor separating the mobile NTD and RBD
regions of a protomer (Figure 1). Small changes in SD2 can translate to large changes in the
NTD and RBD regions (Gobeil et al., 2021). The I692 residue in the S-GSAS-D614G structures
contacts residue P600, and loss of the methyl group at residue 692 due to the I692V substitution
resulted in P600 and V692 being placed farther apart (Supplemental Item 9). While the map
density in this region was well-defined for three of the 3-RBD-down structures (3D-1, 3D-2 and
3D-3), the 3D-4 cryo-EM map showed disorder in this region, as well as the largest separation
between P600 and V692. Thus, given the critical role of the SD2 subdomain, and potential
destabilization in this region due to the I692V mutation in the down-state protomers, we
inspected angular disposition of the NTDʹ and RBD about a vector connecting SD2 and SD1 (ɸ3)
and the angle formed by the NTDʹ, SD2, and SD1 centroids (𝜽3; Figure 2G-H). These were
determined for the down state protomers in the 3-down, 1-up, and 2-up structures. Consistent
with the DDM and PCA results, the 3D-4 protomers occupied a distinct cluster in the ɸ3 and 𝜽3
angles; in particular the 3D-4 chain A protomer ɸ3 dihedral differed markedly from the primary
cluster in a direction toward that observed in up-state protomers (Figure 2H, inset). Comparison

of the 𝜽3 angles indicated 3D-1 chain A, 1U-1 chain A, as well as the 2-up 2U-1 chain C
displayed similarity to the M1 protomers. The 3D-3 chain C and 3D-1 chain A, and 1U-1 chain
A protomers displayed similar ɸ3 dihedrals to the M1 protomers (Figure 2G-H). Comparing the
3D-4 chain A S1 subunit structure to that of the M1 chain A demonstrates the marked differences
between these structures while alignment of M1 chain A S1 subunit to 1U-1 chain A shows their
similarity (Figure 2I). Together, this analysis suggests that loss of a single protomer’s S1 density
in M1 allows the trimer to relax into a more stable 1-up like state. This is likely a result of the
conformational changes indicated by the ɸ3 and 𝜽3 angles emanating from internal SD2 domain
differences mediated by the I692V mutation.
Summary
Overall, the binding and structural data on the S-GSAS-D614G-ΔFV S ectodomain
suggest that the interspecies adaptation involved improved receptor binding affinity mediated
primarily by the Y453F substitution in the receptor binding motif (RBM), as well as an increased
propensity for open states of the S protein. We detected intriguing variability in the 3-RBD-down
states, with conformational changes detected in the S2 subunit that had typically been known to
remain invariant in prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S structures. Finally, we identified a new state that
was missing the S1 subunit of one of its three protomer. The presence of this state and the
unusual variability in the 3-RBD-down states, suggests destabilization of the pre-fusion spike
structure in the S-GSAS-D614G-ΔFV S protein.
The SARS-CoV-2 S protein B.1.1.7 variant
The B.1.1.7 variant emerged in South East England in September 2020 and rapidly
became dominant in the UK. This variant has now spread to over 50 countries with reports of
increased transmissibility, virulence and mortality (Davies et al., 2021). The B.1.1.7 variant
contains 8 mutations in the S protein (in addition to the D614G mutation). The mutations
spanned the NTD (ΔH69/V70 and ΔY144 deletions), the receptor binding motif (RBM) in the
RBD (N501Y), the SD1 subdomain (A570D), the SD2 subdomain (P681H, proximal to the furin
cleavage site), the T716I substitution upstream of the fusion peptide, the HR1 region (S982A),
and the CD domain (D1118H). The NTD ΔH69/V70 deletion is shared with the mink-associated
mutation. The B.1.1.7 variant has been shown to be susceptible to neutralizing antibodies elicited

by current vaccines, as well as to RBD-directed antibodies DH1041, DH1043 and DH1047 (Li et
al., 2021; Shen et al., 2021). The B.1.1.7 variant shows increased resistance to NTD-directed
antibodies including 4A8 (PDB: 7C2L), 5-24, 4-8 and DH1050.1 (PDB: 7LCN) (Li et al., 2021;
Liu et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020), and this was attributed to the ΔY144 deletion that is part of a
loop forming an antigenic supersite in the NTD (Wang et al., 2021a).
Receptor binding and antigenicity of the S-GSAS-B.1.1.7 S ectodomain
To elucidate the antigenic and structural impacts of the S protein mutations, we
constructed an S ectodomain with all 8 mutations of the B.1.1.7 variant (Figure 1A). Consistent
with previous reports, we measured a substantial drop in the binding level of the NTD-directed
antibody DH1050.1 both by ELISA and SPR (Figure 3A, Supplemental Item 2-4). Although
much reduced, the binding was not completely knocked out, and the SPR profile showed
retention of high affinity binding (nM) with a similar kinetic profile as for S-GSAS-D614G
(Figure 3A, Supplementary Table 1). Binding of the B.1.1.7 construct to ACE2 showed ~5fold improvement in affinity relative to the S-GSAS-D614G, contributed primarily by the
N501Y substitution in the receptor binding motif of the RBD. This is consistent with reports
identifying residue 501 as a hotspot for mutagenic modulation of ACE2 binding affinity with the
N501F substitution increasing ACE2 binding in deep mutational scanning studies (Starr et al.,
2020). Adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 in BALB/c mice for vaccine efficacy testing resulted in
N501Y selection, further supporting a functional role for this mutation (Gu et al., 2020). The
N501Y substitution, either on its own or in combination with the NTD H69/V70 deletion or the
SD2 P681H mutation, does not substantially affect serum neutralization elicited by current
vaccines (Wang et al., 2021b; Wu et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2021). These results, together with the
observed resistance to NTD Abs, and robust binding of RBD antibodies, suggest that, although
the NTD antigenic supersite has been rendered ineffective in the B.1.1.7 variant, RBD-directed
antibodies elicited by the current vaccines remain active against this variant.
Cryo-EM structures of the S-GSAS-B.1.1.7 S ectodomain
To visualize the impact of the B.1.1.7 mutations on spike conformation, we solved cryoEM structures of the S-GSAS-B.1.1.7 S ectodomain (Figure 3B-D, Supplementary Table 2,
Supplemental Items 10-12). We performed 3D-classification of the dataset to yield multiple

populations of the 3-RBD-down and RBD-up states. We performed asymmetric reconstruction of
three populations of the 3-RBD-down state that were refined to 3.2-3.6 Å (Figure 3B,
Supplementary Table 2, Supplemental Item 10-11). Each of these states revealed asymmetry
in their three RBDs, with one of the RBDs showing weaker density than the other two (Figure
3B), indicative of enhanced mobility. An RBD in its down state makes interprotomer contacts
with an adjacent NTD and with RBD glycan 343 of the same protomer. (Figure 3B, inset)
(Sztain et al., 2021). Transition from the “down” to “up” state results in replacement of these
contacts with differing RBD-to-NTD and RBD-to-RBD contacts (Figure 3C, inset). The
apparent increase in RBD mobility in the 3-down-state of the B.1.1.7 mutant suggested a reduced
barrier to the transition to the “up” state due to a weakening of the down state contacts.
Consistent with this observation, the S-GSAS-B.1.1.7 cryo-EM dataset revealed a higher
proportion of RBD-up state particles compared to the S-GSAS-D614G dataset (~1.8:1 for RBDup/RBD-down for S-GSAS-B.1.1.7 versus ~1:1 for S-GSAS-D614G) (Gobeil et al., 2021). The
ΔH69/V70 and ΔY144 deletions may contribute, in part, to this result via modification of the
NTD position. In addition to RBD/NTD disorder in the 3-RBD-down states, and the
identification of populations that were refined to yield typical 1-RBD-up structures (Figure 3C),
we also isolated two 1-RBD-up populations in which the up state RBD density was
comparatively weak (Figure 3D). This weak density was accompanied by considerable mobility
in its adjacent NTD as inferred by its weaker density. We also identified states with 2- or 3-RBD
up (Supplemental Item 10G) but limitations of particle numbers and preferred orientations
precluded high resolution reconstructions of these populations. Unlike the mink-associated SGSAS-D614G-ΔFV ectodomain structures, DDM analysis of the S-GSAS-B.1.1.7 structures did
not show variability in the S2 subunit (Supplemental Item 12).
Taken together, our results from the antigenicity assays and the cryo-EM structures are
consistent with other studies that have reported impairment of the NTD antigenic supersite in the
B.1.1.7 variant (Wang et al., 2021a), while retaining binding to most RBD-directed antibodies.
Binding to the cross-reactive fusion peptide directed antibody DH1058 was also retained (Figure
3A) (Li et al., 2021). Our results are also consistent with the reported enhancement of ACE2
binding via the N501Y mutation (Starr et al., 2020). We observed higher propensity for RBD-up
states in the cryo-EM dataset, evidenced both by an increased percentage of the total particles

adopting RBD-up state, as well as appearance of 2-up and 3-up states that were not detected in
the S-GSAS-D614G dataset (Gobeil et al., 2021).
We next sought to understand the role of the B.1.1.7 variant mutations distal from the
mobile RBD/NTD region. These mutations spanned multiple domains including the SD1
(A570D), SD2 (P681H), HR1 (S982A) and CD (D1118H) and the linker region between SD2
and fusion peptide (T716I) (Figure 1A). The P681H mutation, which is located in the SD2
subdomain and proximal to the furin cleavage site, could not be visualized due to the disorder in
that region of the density. We found that the D1118H mutation resulted in the formation of a
symmetric histidine triad near the base of the spike (Figure 3E, 4A-B). Although the histidines
from the three protomers were positioned farther from each other than what would enable direct
hydrogen bonding, water mediated interactions would be feasible at this separation. Moreover,
the cryo-EM reconstructions showed evidence for alternate conformations (Supplemental Item
11) that could potentially place the histidines from the different protomers into closer proximity;
thus, the D1118H mutation appears to be a stabilizing mutation. In contrast, the T716I mutation
appears destabilizing, resulting in the loss of a hydrogen bond between theThr716 side chain
makes and Gln1071 main chain carbonyl (Figure 4C-D). We next examined the two mutations,
A570D and S982A (Figure 4E-I), which appeared to be counterposing. In the S-GSAS-D614G
spike, the SD1 loop containing A570 stacks against the hydrophobic face of a HR1 helix (Figure
4F), and the S982 residue in the HR1 domain hydrogen bonds with the side chain of T547 in
SD1 (Figure 4H). Mutating A570 to Asp reinforced the stacking between the loop and the HR1
helix with the D570 side chain forming a hydrogen bond with the side chain of N856 (Figure
4F). The S982A mutation, in contrast, results in the loss of a hydrogen bond that the side chain
of S982 makes with the SD1 residues T457 (Figure 4G-H). Comparing this region in the
“down” (PDB: 7KDH) and “up” (PDB: 7KDL) protomers of S-GSAS-D614G showed a ~5 Å
shift in the position of this loop with the loop in the “up” protomer moving farther away from,
and no longer within hydrogen bonding distance of S982 (Figure 4H). Thus, the S982A
mutation is akin to disabling a latch that modulates the “up” and “down” RBD dispositions,
thereby increasing the propensity of the RBD to adopt the up-state position. (Figure 4I).

We next examined residue contact and domain position changes in the S-GSAS-B.1.1.7 S
ectodomain relative to S-GSAS-D614G. Loss of the S2 S982-T547 latch hydrogen bond resulted
in a ~2 Å Cα-Cα shift in each protomer; visual inspection of each SD1 revealed the A570D
containing loop occupies distinct positions (Figure 4H-I). This was reminiscent of u1S2q, an upstate stabilized construct we reported earlier, where a similar shift in the position of the A570
loop was implicated in increased up state propensity (Henderson et al., 2020). The marked
asymmetry of the C1 reconstruction, in conjunction with the close coupling between SD1 and
NTDʹ, suggested that these shifts might act to release constraints on the down state via reduced
NTD to RBD coupling. Further, relative shifts in the orientation of a single SD1 should
propagate throughout the trimer due to close contact between a SD1 loop (residues 557-569)
contact with the adjacent protomer’s NTDʹ loops (residues 38-45 and 281-284) as well as contact
between RBDs. In order to examine the relative configurations of these domains, we determined
angular dispositions between spatially paired SD1, NTDʹ and SD2 domains via a vector network
spanning the trimer (Figure 4J-K). Examination of the angle between the mobile RBD adjacent
NTDʹ, and SD2 revealed a marked increase in angle relative to the other two protomers with a
concomitant shift in the SD2 to SD1 angle. These angular changes were accompanied by a
rotation of the NTDʹ relative to the SD2 as well as a compensatory rotation of the distal protomer
SD1 to NTDʹ disposition. This compensatory shift explains the observed differences in the
A570D loop positions. With the SD2 disposition relative to S2 largely similar to that of the other
protomers, these movements can be ascribed to the S982A and A570D induced movements of
SD1. Together, these changes results in disengagement of the NTD from the adjacent RBD,
explaining the apparent increase in RBD mobility. This indicates the S982A and A570D pairing
act as an allosteric switch through coupling of domain movements.
Summary
Taken together, our structural analysis of the S-GSAS-B.1.1.7 ectodomain highlights how
allosteric effect of mutations in distal regions alter its RBD disposition. Moreover, the evolution
of the B.1.1.7 variant appears to have balanced mutations that destabilizes the RBD-down or
“closed” state to favor the RBD-up or “open” conformation, with other mutations that stabilize
the pre-fusion spike conformation.

The SARS-CoV-2 S protein B.1.351 and B.1.1.28 variants
The B.1.351 variant (20H/501Y.V2) harbors eight S protein mutations relative to the
Wuhan-1 D614G mutant virus. All but one are located in the NTD and the RBD (Figure 1A).
Accumulation of mutations in these immunodominant regions of the spike suggested selection
pressure due to immune evasion. This is supported by reports that demonstrated resistance of the
B.1.351 variant to RBD and NTD-directed antibodies, as well as to convalescent sera (Wibmer et
al., 2021). B.1.351 has three mutations in the RBD - K417N, E484K and N501Y. These
mutations also arose independently in Brazil in the B.1.1.28 variant. The B.1.1.28 variant
subsequently acquired additional mutations in later variants, including the P.1 variant that was
responsible for a resurgent COVID-19 outbreak in Manaus, Brazil (Sabino et al., 2021). We and
others have shown that these three mutations have a strong deleterious effect on the activity of
some RBD-directed antibodies. The E484K mutation is of particular concern, and has been
shown to reduce or eliminate binding to many Class 1 RBD-directed antibodies, including
antibody DH1041 when measured in an RBD only construct (Saunders et al., 2021; Wibmer et
al., 2021). To study the effect of the B.1.351 mutations on the structure and the antigenicity of
the S protein, we prepared an S ectodomain construct, S-GSAS-B.1.351, containing the eight
mutations (Figure 1A). Additionally, we prepared an S ectodomain construct, S-GSAS-B.1.1.28,
containing only the B.1.351 RBD mutations.
Receptor binding and antigenicity of the S-GSAS-B.1.351 and S-GSAS-B.1.1.28 ectodomains
We measured binding of the S-GSAS-B.1.351 and S-GSAS-B.1.1.28 constructs to the
ACE2 receptor and to antibodies targeting different S epitopes by ELISA and SPR (Figure 5,
Supplemental Items 3-5 and Supplementary Table 1). The ACE2 binding affinity to both
variant S ectodomains improved relative to S-GSAS-D614G, an effect attributed to the N501Y
mutation, also shared by the S-GSAS-B.1.1.7 variant (Figures 3A and 5A). The binding to the
neutralizing NTD-directed antibody DH1050.1 was unaffected by the E484K mutation or by the
triple RBD mutant S-GSAS-B.1.1.28, but was, however, impacted in the S-GSAS-B.1.351
construct that has multiple mutations in the NTD (Figure 5A, Supplemental Item 2B).
Although much reduced, DH1050.1 binding to S-GSAS-B.1.351 showed similar kinetics profile
as S-GSAS-D614G (Figure 5A and Supplemental Item 4).

The RBD-directed antibodies DH1041 and DH1043 bound robustly to the S-GSASD614G-E484K and S-GSAS-B.1.1.28 spikes by ELISA, although the E484K mutation is located
at the epitope of these antibodies (Supplemental Item 2 and 3) (Li et al., 2021). By SPR, even
though we observed decrease in the levels of binding of the DH1041 and DH1043 Fab to SGSAS-D614G-E484K and S-GSAS-B.1.1.28 relative to S-GSAS-D614G, the binding profile
was indicative of stable binding to the spikes (Figure 5A and Supplemental Item 2B). The
observation of robust and stable binding of the S-GSAS-D614G-E484K and S-GSAS-B.1.1.28
spikes to DH1041 and DH1043 despite the E484 residue being at the binding interface suggested
accommodation of the E484K mutation. The binding of DH1041 and DH1043 to S-GSASB.1.351 was, however, dramatically reduced relative to S-GSAS-B.1.1.28, demonstrating an
allosteric effect of the NTD mutations in S-GSAS-B.1.351 on the binding of antibodies DH1041
and DH1043. The binding data showing ability of antibodies DH1041 to accommodate the
E484K mutation when binding to the spike, was is in contrast to its binding to an RBD-only
construct, where the E484K mutation was shown to result in complete knockout of binding by
ELISA (Saunders et al., 2021). We also measured dramatic loss of binding to antibodies DH1041
and DH1043 that target the RBD “hook” by SPR (Figure 5B and Supplemental Item 13). At
the same time, binding to cross-reactive RBD-directed antibody DH1047 remained unaltered
whether to the mutant spikes or to RBD-only constructs (Figure 5C) (Saunders et al., 2021). The
binding to the fusion peptide-directed antibody DH1058 also remained unaffected by the spike
mutations acquired by the variants (Supplemental Items 2 and 4).
Cryo-EM structures of the S-GSAS-B.1.351 and S-GSAS-B.1.1.28 ectodomains
To visualize the impact of the mutations on the S protein conformation, we determined
cryo-EM structures of S-GSAS-B.1.351 and S-GSAS-B.1.1.28 S ectodomains (Figure 6,
Supplementary Table 2, Supplemental Items 14-17). We identified 3-RBD-down, 1-RBD-up
and 2-RBD-up states in the S-GSAS-B.1.351 dataset, with total particle numbers of each state at
212,753, 1,047,277 and 200,301 respectively, thus resulting in ~6:1 ratio of up to down state
RBDs. The reduction in the fraction of closed or 3-RBD-down states is in contrast to the roughly
1:1 ratio reported for the S-GSAS-D614G ectodomain. A “consensus” 3-RBD-down state with
212,753 particles was refined to 3.7 Å, and displayed remarkably weak RBD density in one of
the 3 RBDs that also appeared detached from its interprotomer contacting NTD (Figure 6A).

Further classification of this consensus state yielded substates that showed similar features as the
consensus structure, including a 65,713-particle state that we refined to 3.7 Å (Supplemental
Item 14). A 2-RBD-up population comprised of 200,301 particles was refined to overall
resolution of 3.7 Å. Several populations of spike with one RBD in the “up” position were
identified, which yielded typical 1-RBD-up structures with well-aligned S2 regions and
variability in the S1 region due to NTD/RBD motion, and additional mobility of the “up” RBD
(compared to a “down” RBD) as it oscillated between its interprotomer contacts with an NTD
and an adjacent RBD (Figure 6A and Supplemental Item 17).
The S-GSAS-B.1.1.28 cryo-EM dataset mirrored the dramatic shift in the populations
seen in the S-GSAS-B.1.351 dataset, with more heterogeneity and greater disorder in the smaller
fraction of closed (or 3-RBD-down) structures and increase in the “up” or open populations. We
identified multiple populations of “up” RBD states in the S-GSAS-B.1.1.28 dataset, including
intermediate states that showed 1 RBD in the “up” position and another partially up. 3-RBDdown states accounted for ~12% of the total spike population, and the cryo-EM reconstructions
of these states showed considerable disorder in the RBDs. This disorder was more pronounced
for one out of the three RBDs and its contacting NTD (Figure 6B). These observations implicate
the 3 RBD mutations – K417N, E484K and N501Y – in disordering the RBDs in the 3-RBDdown state, and increasing the propensity to adopt an “up” configuration.
Vector analysis of the S-GSAS-B.1.351 and S-GSAS-B.1.1.28 ectodomain structures
Unlike the B.1.1.7 and mink-associated cluster 5 variants , the B.1.351 and B.1.1.28
variants include no S1 to S2 or interprotomer S1 mutations outside the RBD. The only mutation
in the B.1.351 variant that is outside of the NTD and RBD regions is A701V that is located in the
region between the SD2 and the fusion peptide, and is not involved in interdomain contacts.
Visualization of the S1 interprotomer interfaces and alignment of each SD2 indicates each RBD
and SD1 occupy distinct positions in both variants (Figure 6C). Unlike spikes harboring SD2 or
SD1 mutations, the SD1 rotations in the B.1.351 and B.1.1.28 variants occur about an axis nearer
the residue 570 loop, limiting this loop’s movement. These SD1 rotations result in large SD2 to
SD1 angular differences and concomitant changes in the SD2 to SD1, SD1 to NTDʹ, NTDʹ to
SD2 dihedral dispositions with relatively muted differences in the NTDʹ to SD2 angles (Figure
6D). Examination of the intra-protomer angles and dihedrals involving the RBD shows marked

differences as well. In particular the protomer3 RBD orientation stands out resulting in its shift
away from the adjacent NTD. Considering the location of the B.1.351 and B.1.1.28 mutations at
the RBD-to-RBD interfaces and the lack of inter- and intra-protomer S1 mutations elsewhere, the
observed differences in domain dispositions likely propagate through the RBD to SD1. Where
the previously discussed variant structures appear to use SD2 or SD1 mediated NTD
disengagement to facilitate enhanced RBD exposure, the B.1.351 and B.1.1.28 variants may
instead utilize modification of the previously identified N343-glycan gate (Sztain et al., 2021)
that contacts the adjacent RBD tip at a location near the E484K mutation to achieve a similar
result.
Molecular dynamics simulations of RBD
The loss in binding of the RBD tip targeting DH1041 and DH1043 to the RBD-only
construct harboring the K417N, E484K and N501Y mutations, was in contrast to their ability to
bind the spike harboring the same three mutations in S-GSAS-B.1.1.28, where substantial
binding was retained in ELISA and SPR assays (Figure 5A-C, Supplemental Items 2, 4 and
15). This suggested that disruption of intermolecular interactions between the spike and antibody
by the E484K substitution is not solely responsible for the differences in interaction and that
there might, therefore, be a conformational component to this observation. The cryo-EM
structures of the down state spike of the B.1.1.28 variant displayed considerable disorder,
especially at the RBD tip. Since the E484K substitution occurs at an interdomain interface where
two adjacent RBDs contact via the N343-glycan of one with the RBD tip/hook region of the
other (Figure 3B), we probed the conformational effect of the E484K substitution on the
conformation of that region using molecular dynamics simulations. We built Markov state
models of transitions between conformational states from large ensembles of short molecular
dynamics simulations of both an unmutated RBD and a RBD harboring the K417N, E484K and
N501Y mutations. (Supplemental Items 18-20; ~260 µs total simulation time each). The
Markov models for both RBD constructs were characterized by an RBD folded tip, “Hook” state,
consistent with the conformation observed in binding mode 1 and 2 (Yuan et al., 2020) of RBD
tip targeting Fab-RBD complex x-ray crystal structures, and a highly dynamic “Disordered” state
in which the tip cycles between a variety of conformations (Figures 6E-F, Supplemental Items
18 and 19, C and E ). While the native RBD displays a nearly even proportion of “Hook” vs.

“Disordered” states, the triple mutant RBD spike shows a dramatic increase in the “Disordered”
state population with a concomitant reduction in the “Hook” state (Figure 6E). These population
differences are a consequence of an increased transition rate to the “Disordered” state from the
“Hook” state in combination with a reduced transition rate back to the “Hook” state in the triple
mutant compared to the native RBD (Supplemental Items 18 and 19F). Monitoring of the
interactions between residue 484 sidechain in each model indicate the native E484 hydrogen
bonds with the F490 backbone in particular, stabilizing the “Hook” state (Supplemental Item
20). Conversely, in the “Disordered” state, the K484 side chain forms fewer interactions across
the RBD compared to E484, which primarily forms “Hook” region interactions (Supplemental
Item 20B). Together, these results are consistent with a loss in DH1041 and DH1043 binding in
the RBD-only context and indicate that the E484K mutation acts to destabilize the mode 1 and 2
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing Mab-preferred conformation of the RBD tip. E484K mutation
enhanced conformational disorder in the RBD “hook” may also be the source of the increased
RBD up state population observed in both the B.1.351 and B.1.1.28 variants due to weakened
RBD to RBD coupling. In the context of the spike, interprotomer interactions made by the RBD
in its up state, as well as secondary contacts that the bound antibody makes to adjacent RBDs
may play a role in stabilizing antibody binding to the E484K mutant (Supplemental Figure 3).
The SARS-CoV-2 S protein variant conformational comparison
Collectively, the structural results presented here indicate the primary consequence of 3down state variant conformational adjustments is increased exposure of the RBD. A prime
source of increased RBD up state propensity appears to be destabilization of one or more down
RBDs in the 3-down state. In order to compare and contrast the disparate approaches toward
destabilization, we generated an additional vector set describing RBD dispositions relative to
adjacent RBDs and NTDs (Figure 7). Using an asymmetric refinement of the u1S2q design
(Henderson et al., 2020) and four of our previously published 3-down state S-GSAS-D614G
reconstructions (Gobeil et al., 2021), we first examined PCA clustering to identify structurally
similar sets (Figure 7A). The B.1.351 and B.1.1.28 variants as well as the 3D-1 and 3D-3 SGSAS-D614G-ΔFV structures were largely similar to the S-GSAS-D614G structures while the
B.1.1.7 and 3D-2 S-GSAS-D614G-ΔFV structures cluster with the u1S2q structure. The SGSAS-D614G-ΔFV 3D-4 structure differs markedly from all others and may correspond to a

pre-protomer S1 dissociated (M1) state. The separation of S-GSAS-D614G-like and u1S2q-like
sets is consistent with our structural analysis suggesting the B.1.351 and B.1.1.28 RBD
destabilization is mediated by RBD-RBD contacts while the B.1.1.7 and D614G-ΔFV strategy
utilizes modified SD1 or SD2 to S2 interaction for the same purpose. We next examined the
primary vector contributors to differences observed in these clusters. Consistent with a role for
the mobile RBD protomer, the three most variable measures are part of the mobile RBD
protomer and included the angle between SD2 and SD1 as well as distances between S2 to SD2
and S2 to NTDʹ (Figure 7B, C). Finally, the interconnected network of domain interactions
suggests the protomer configurations should show correlations and that these might differ among
the clusters (Figure 7D). We therefore examined angular correlations between SD2, SD1, and
NTDʹ orientations. As these orientations are label dependent, and since RBD mobility is closely
tied to NTD proximity, and therefore to RBD up-state propensity, we assigned the RBD most
distant from its adjacent NTD as the anchor for these comparisons. Examination of the
correlation results indicated the Protomer3 and Unit1 angles and dihedrals in particular display
significant correlated movements (Figure 7E-F; Supplemental Items 21-25). In the S-GSASD614G cluster structures, these together give rise to a shift in Unit3, drawing RBD3 away from
the mobile RBD1 for which the N343-glycan bridging density is absent. The remaining RBD to
RBD contact existed between the mobile RBD tip and adjacent RBD, with the B.1.351 and
B.1.1.28 variant disordered tip presumably reducing the stability of this contact leading to their
observed increase in up-state propensity. Correlations at these sites were often weaker in the
u1S2q cluster which showed correlations primarily in the dihedral angles (Supplemental Items
21-25). These results show that the spike variants utilized the domain contact network to
facilitate shifts in the RBD up state propensity by two different means. The analysis of domain
contact differences demonstrates that disparate mutation sites with differing mechanistic impact
on S protein conformation can effectively converge on similar increases in up-state RBDs.
Discussion
As multiple COVID-19 vaccines are being rolled out world-wide, the evolution of SARSCoV-2 and acquisition of resistance to neutralizing antibodies is concerning as they may render
current vaccines less effective, and, together with their increased transmissibility, threaten to
prolong the pandemic. A different kind of threat is posed by interspecies transmission of SARS-

CoV-2 from humans to other animals, with the case of transmission between mink and humans
in mink farms. Establishment of a reservoir in a non-human host raises the possibility that the
virus will evolve within the non-human host acquiring new mutations, and a transmission back to
humans may cause these new variants to be resistant to vaccines and therapies. Since these
reports came to light, there have been accelerated efforts to understand the effect of these
mutations on viral fitness, transmissibility and resistance to antibodies elicited by current
vaccines. Yet, a structural and mechanistic understanding of the effect of the S protein mutations
in these variants is thus far lacking.
Here, we studied the S proteins of several SARS-CoV-2 variants in the context of a
soluble S ectodomain. We have found similarities as well as fundamental differences between
SARS-CoV-2 S protein evolution in the variant associated with inter-species transmission from
the variants of interest that evolved in human hosts. All new variants studied showed increased
binding to ACE2 receptor. For the variants that arose and evolved in humans, this is consistent
with their increased transmissibility. For the mink-associated variant, the increased affinity of the
S protein for the ACE2 receptor may play a role in engaging the homologous receptor in minks,
helping to establish infection in the new host. While all human-evolved variants studied here
showed reduced binding to antibodies at dominant neutralization epitopes, the mink-associated
variant retained similar levels of binding to all antibodies tested. Pressure to adapt to a new host
may render the virus less fit in the natural host. Consistent with this possibility, we observed
evidence for mink-associated variant S protein instability, including identification of a spike
population that was partially unfolded. These observations may provide insights into why the
mink-associated variant, although it was transmitted back to humans, did not spread very widely.
For the human-evolved variants of interest, we found that the S protein utilized different
mechanisms for manipulation of its immunodominant regions, namely the NTD and RBD, and to
converge on a common goal of destabilizing the 3-RBD-down state. While in the B.1.1.7 variant
this occurred by modifications in SD1 or SD2 to S2 interaction, for the B.1.351 and B.1.1.28
variants RBD destabilization was mediated by RBD-RBD contacts. Indeed, we found intriguing
similarities between mutations we had previously engineered to manipulate the S protein
(Henderson et al., 2020) with mutations that occur naturally. The CoV spike protein utilizes a
network of S1 subunit domain interactions to control the functionally critical disposition of the
RBD. The extensive interconnectivity and inherent metastability of the spike render the entire

molecular configuration susceptible to relatively minor modifications to domain pairing strength.
Our results here show that SARS-CoV-2 variants have taken advantage of this mechanical
feature to modify the structural state of the spike.
In summary, our studies provide a structural and mechanistic understanding of the impact
of mutations that naturally evolved during the course of a pandemic on the S protein
conformation, and in doing so, provides a framework for understanding their functional impact.
We demonstrate that convergent S protein evolution to increase SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility
and escape neutralization at immunodominant NTD and RBD epitopes can occur via different
allosteric communication networks in the spike.

ectodomain constructs comprised the S protein residues 1 to 1208 (GenBank: MN908947) with
the D614G mutation, the furin cleavage site (RRAR; residue 682-685) mutated to GSAS, a Cterminal T4 fibritin trimerization motif, a C-terminal HRV3C protease cleavage site, a
TwinStrepTag and an 8XHisTag. All spike ectodomains were cloned into the mammalian
expression vector pαH (Wrapp et al., 2020). For the ACE2 construct, the C-terminus was fused a
human Fc region.
Protein purification
On the 6th day post transfection, spike ectodomains were harvested from the concentrated
supernatant. The spike ectodomains were purified using StrepTactin resin (IBA) and size exclusion
chromatography (SEC) using a Superose 6 10/300 GL Increase column equilibrated in 2mM Tris,
pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3. All steps of the purification were performed at room
temperature and in a single day. The purified proteins were flash frozen and stored at -80 °C in
single-use aliquots. Each aliquot were thawed by a 20-minute incubation at 37 °C before use.
Antibodies were produced in Expi293F cells and purified by Protein A affinity and digested to
their Fab state using LysC. ACE2 with human Fc tag was purified by Protein A affinity
chromatography and SEC.
SPR
Antibody binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD constructs was assessed using SPR on a Biacore
T-200 (Cytiva, formerly GE Healthcare) with HBS buffer supplemented with 3 mM EDTA and
0.05% surfactant P-20 (HBS-EP+). All binding assays were performed at 25 °C. Spike variants
were captured on a Series S Strepavidin (SA) chip coated at 200 nM (60s at 10µL/min). The
antibodies Fabs were injected at concentrations ranging from 0.625 nM to 800 nM (prepared in a
2-fold serial dilution manner) over the S proteins using the single cycle kinetics mode with 5
concentration per cycle. For the single injection assay, the Fabs were used at a concentration of
200nM. A contact time of 60 seconds and a dissociation time of 120 seconds (3600 seconds for
DH1047) at a flow rate of 50µL/min was used. The surface was regenerated after the last injection
with 3 pulses of a 50mM NaoH + 1M NaCl solution for 10 seconds at 100µL/min. For the RBDs,
the antibodies were captured on a CM5 chip coated with HumanAntiFc (Cytiva) by their FC region
at 100nM using a flowrate of 5µL/min for 120s. The RBDs were then injected at 100nM for 120s
at a flowrate of 50µL/min with a dissociation time of 30s. The surface was regenerated by 3
consecutive pulse of 3M MgCl2 for 10s at 100µL/min. Sensogram data were analyzed using the
BiaEvaluation software (Cytiva)
Negative-stain electron microscopy
Samples were diluted to 100 µg/ml in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 7.5
mM glutaraldehyde and incubated for 5 minutes before quenching the glutaraldehyde by the
addition of 1 M Tris (to a final concentration of 75 mM) and 5 minutes incubation. A 5-µl drop of
sample was applied to a glow-discharged carbon-coated grid for 10-15 seconds, blotted, stained
with 2% uranyl formate, blotted and air-dried. Images were obtained using a Philips EM420
electron microscope at 120 kV, 82,000× magnification, and a 4.02 Å pixel size. The RELION
(Scheres, 2012) software was used for particle picking, and 2D and 3D class averaging.
ELISA assays
Spike ectodomains tested for antibody- or ACE2-binding in ELISA assays as previously described
(Edwards et al., 2020). Assays were run in two formats i.e. antibodies/ACE2 coated or spike
coated. For the first format, the assay was performed on 384-well plates coated at 2 µg/ml
overnight at 4°C, washed, blocked and followed by two-fold serially diluted spike protein starting
at 25 µg/mL. Binding was detected with polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike rabbit serum

(developed in our lab), followed by goat anti-rabbit-HRP and TMB substrate. Absorbance was
read at 450 nm. In the second format, serially diluted spike protein was bound in wells of a 384well plates, which were previously coated with streptavidin at 2 µg/mL and blocked. Proteins were
incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, washed, then human mAbs were added at 10 µg/ml.
Antibodies were incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, washed and binding detected with goat
anti-human-HRP and TMB substrate.
Cryo-EM
Purified SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomains were diluted to a concentration of ~1.5 mg/mL in 2 mM
Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl and 0.02% NaN3 and 0.5% glycerol was added. A 2.3-µL drop of
protein was deposited on a Quantifoil-1.2/1.3 grid that had been glow discharged for 10 seconds
using a PELCO easiGlow™ Glow Discharge Cleaning System. After a 30 seconds incubation in
>95% humidity, excess protein was blotted away for 2.5 seconds before being plunge frozen into
liquid ethane using a Leica EM GP2 plunge freezer (Leica Microsystems). Frozen grids were
imaged using a Titan Krios (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a K3 detector (Gatan).
Vector Based Structure Analysis
Vector analysis of intra-protomer domain positions was performed as described previously
(Henderson et al., 2020) using the Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD)(Humphrey et al., 1996)
software package Tcl interface. For each protomer of each structure, Cα centroids were
determined for the NTD (residues 27 to 69, 80 to 130, 168 to 172, 187 to 209, 216 to 242, and
263 to 271), NTD’ (residues 44 to 53 and 272 to 293), RBD (residues 334 to 378, 389 to 443,
and 503 to 521), SD1 (residues 323 to 329 and 529 to 590), SD2 (residues 294 to 322, 591 to
620, 641 to 691, and 692 to 696), CD (residues 711 to 716 1072 to 1121), and a S2 sheet motif
(S2s; residues 717 to 727 and 1047 to 1071). Additional centroids for the NTD (NTDc; residues
116 to 129 and 169 to 172) and RBD (RBDc; residues 403 to 410) were determined for use as
reference points for monitoring the relative NTD and RBD orientations to the NTD’ and SD1,
respectively. Vectors were calculated between the following within protomer centroids: NTD to
NTD’, NTD’ to SD2, SD2 to SD1, SD2 to CD, SD1 to RBD, CD to S2s, NTDc to NTD, RBD to
RBDc. Vector magnitudes, angles, and dihedrals were determined from these vectors and
centroids. Inter-protomer domain vector calculations for the SD2, SD1, and NTD’ used these
centroids in addition to anchor residue Cα positions for each domain including SD2 residue 671
(SD2r), SD1 residue 575 (SD1r), and NTD’ residue 276 (NTD’r). These were selected based
upon visualization of position variation in all protomers used in this analysis via alignment of all
of each domain in PyMol(Schrodinger, 2015). Vectors were calculated for the following: NTD’
to NTD’r, NTD’ to SD2, SD2 to SD2r, SD2 to SD1, SD1 to SD1r, and SD1 to NTD’. Angles and
dihedrals were determined from these vectors and centroids. Vectors for the RBD to adjacent
RBD and RBD to adjacent NTD were calculated using the above RBD, NTD, and RBDc
centroids. Vectors were calculated for the following: RBD2 to RBD1, RBD3 to RBD2, and RBD3
to RBD1. Angles and dihedrals were determined from these vectors and centroids. Principal
components analysis, K-means clustering, and Pearson correlation (confidence interval 0.95,
p<0.05) analysis of vectors sets was performed in R(Team, 2017). Data were centered and scaled
for the PCA analyses.
Adaptive Sampling Molecular Dynamics
The CHARMM CR3022 bound SARS-CoV-2 RBD crystal structure(Nichols et al., 2020) (PDB
ID 6ZLR) model(Jo et al., 2008; Woo et al., 2020) was used for the adaptive sampling
simulations. The CR3022 antibody, glycan unit, water, and ions were stripped from the model

leaving only the protein portion of the RBD. The final model comprised Spike residues 327 to
529. A single Man5 glycan was added at the N343 position using the CHARMM GUI(Jo et al.,
2008) with the B.1.1.28/B.1.351 RBD mutations K417N, E484K, and N501Y prepared in
PyMol. Systems for simulation were built using the AmberTools20 Leap(D.A. Case, 2020)
program. The unmutated (WT) and B.1.1.28/B.1.351 (Mut) RBDs were immersed in a truncated
octahedral TIP3P water box with a minimum edge distance of 15 Å to the nearest protein atom
followed by system neutralization with chlorine atoms resulting in systems sizes of 67,508 and
66,894 atoms for the WT and Mut, respectively. The Amber ff14SB protein(Maier et al., 2015)
and Glycam(Kirschner et al., 2008) forefields were used throughout. All simulations were
performed using the Amber20 pmemd CUDA implementation. The systems were first minimized
for 10,000 steps with protein atom restraints followed by minimization of the full system without
restraints for an additional 10,000 steps. This was followed by heating of the systems from 0 K
to 298 K over a period of 20 ps in the NVT ensemble using a 2 fs timestep using the particle
mesh Ewald method for long-range electrostatics and periodic boundary conditions(Essmann et
al., 1995). The systems were then equilibrated for 100 ps in the NPT ensemble with the
temperature controlled using Langevin dynamics with a frequency of 1.0 ps-1 and 1 atm pressure
maintained using isotropic position scaling with a relaxation time of 2 ps (Loncharich et al.,
1992). A non-bonded cut-off of 8 Å was used throughout and hydrogen atoms were constrained
using the SHAKE algorithm (Ryckaert et al., 1977) with hydrogen mass repartitioning (Hopkins
et al., 2015) used to allow for a 4 fs timestep. In order to generate an ensemble of RBD tip
conformations for initiation of the adaptive sampling routine, we performed one hundred 50 ns
simulations in the NVT ensemble with randomized initial velocities for each of the WT and Mut
systems. The final frame from each of these simulations was used to initiate the adaptive
sampling scheme. Adaptive sampling was performed using the High-Throughput Molecular
Dynamics (HTMD v. 1.24.2) package (Doerr et al., 2016). Each iteration consisted of 50-100
independent simulations of 100 ns. Simulations from each iteration were first projected using a
dihedral metric with angles split into their sin and cos components for residues 454 to 491. This
was followed by a TICA (Pérez-Hernández et al., 2013) projection using a lag time of 5 ns and
retaining five dimensions. Markov state models were then built using a lag time of 50 ns for the
selection of new states for the next iteration. A total of 29 adaptive iterations were performed
yielding total simulation times of 274.8 and 256.8 µs for the WT and Mut systems, respectively.
Simulations were visualized in VMD and PyMol.
Markov State Modelling
Markov state models (MSMs) were prepared in HTMD with an appropriate coordinate projection
selected using PyEMMA (Scherer et al., 2015) (v. 2.5.7). Multiple projections were tested on a
25 µs subset of the Mut simulations that included atomic distance and contact measures between
RBD residues as well as backbone torsions of the RBD tip residues using the variational
approach to Markov processes score (Wu and Noé, 2020) (Supplementary Table 3). This led to
the selection of a Cα pairwise distance metric between residues 471 to 480 and 484 to 488 for
MSM construction. MSMs were prepared in HTMD using a TICA lag time of 5 ns retaining five
dimensions followed by K-means clustering using 500 cluster centers. The implied timescales
(ITS) plots were used to select a lag time of 30 ns for MSM building. Models were coarsegrained via Perron cluster cluster analysis (PCCA++) using 2 states and validated using the
Chapman-Kolmogorov (CK) test. A bootstrapping routine without replacement was used to
calculate measurement errors retaining 80% of the data per iteration for a total of 100 iterations.

State statistics were collected for mean first passage times (MFPT), stationary distributions, and
root-mean square deviations (RMSD) for RBD tip residues 470-490. Residue 484 sidechain
contacts were calculated from a representative model. A contact was defined as atom pairing
within 3.5 Å between either the minimum of either E484 𝛾-carboxyl O atoms (for WT) or K484
ε-amino N atom (for Mut) and backbone or sidechain O or N atoms for residues 348 to 354, 413
to 425, or 446 to 500. The RMSD and contact metric means were model weighted. Weighted
state ensembles containing 250 structures were collected for visualization in VMD.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Principal components analysis, K-means clustering, and Pearson correlation (confidence
interval 0.95, p<0.05) analysis of vectors sets was performed in R. Data were centered and scaled
for the PCA analyses.

Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein ectodomains for characterizing structures and
antigenicity of S protein variants. A. Domain architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protomer. The
S1 subunit contains a signal sequence (SS), the NTD (N-terminal domain, pale green), N2R (NTD-toRBD linker, cyan), RBD (receptor-binding domain, red), SD1 and SD2 (subdomain 1 and 2, dark blue
and orange) subdomains. The S2 subunit contains the FP (fusion peptide, dark green), HR1 (heptad
repeat 1, yellow), CH (central helix, teal), CD (connector domain, purple) and HR2 (heptad repeat 2,
grey) subdomains. The transmembrane domain (TM) and cytoplasmic tail (CT) have been truncated
and replaced by a foldon trimerization sequence (3), an HRV3C cleavage site (HRV3C), a his-tag (His)
and strep-tag (Strep). The D614G mutation is in the SD2 domain (yellow star, green contour). The
S1/S2 furin cleavage site (RRAR) has been mutated to GSAS (blue lightning). B. Representation of the
trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain with one RBD-up in a prefusion conformation (PDB ID 7KDL).
The S1 domain on an RBD-down protomer is shown as pale orange molecular surface while the S2
domain is shown in pale green. The subdomains on an RBD-up protomer are colored according to
panel A on a ribbon diagram. Each inset correspond to the spike regions harboring mutations included
in this study. C. Representative NSEM micrographs and 2D class averages of S protein variants.
