Abstract

23

Tilorone is a 50-year-old synthetic small-molecule compound with antiviral activity that is

24

proposed to induce interferon after oral administration. This drug is used as a broad-

25

spectrum antiviral in several countries of the Russian Federation. We have recently

26

described activity in vitro and in vivo against the Ebola Virus. After a broad screening of

27

additional viruses, we now describe in vitro activity against Chikungunya virus (CHIK)

28

and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

33

In recent years we have witnessed major Ebola virus outbreaks in Africa, the Zika

34

outbreak in Brazil and now the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in China. These viruses

35

are rarely confined to their original locations and thus create challenges in containment.

36

Newer viruses also lack available approved treatments and indicate the need for

37

broader spectrum antivirals. We now highlight one such molecule, tilorone

38

dihydrochloride (tilorone, Amixin® or Lavomax®) which is currently registered for human

39

use in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova,

40

Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan as an antiviral (influenza, acute respiratory viral infection,

41

viral hepatitis, viral encephalitis, myelitis, and others) and immunomodulating

42

medication. It is also included in the list of essential medicines of the Russian

43

Federation. In vivo efficacy studies dating back to 1970 support possible uses against a

44

broad array of viruses including influenza A, influenza B, herpes simplex virus 1, West

45

Nile virus, Mengo virus, Semliki Forest virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and

46

encephalomyocarditis virus (1-3). More recently we recently demonstrated 90-100%

47

survival in mice infected with Ebola then treated with tilorone (4). These results led us to

48

more broadly profile the antiviral spectrum of activity and focus on Chikungunya virus

49

(CHIK) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Tilorone screening in antiviral assays. Tilorone dihydrochloride was purchased from

52

Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Tilorone was tested (using the NIAID DMID services)

53

against representatives of the herpesviridae, bunyaviridae, togaviridae, arenaviridae,

54

flavivirdae, picornaviridae, poxviridae, hepatic viruses, respiratory viruses and other

55

viruses. Four-concentration CPE inhibition assays were performed. Confluent or near-

56

confluent cell culture monolayers in 96-well disposable microplates were prepared.

57

Cells were maintained in MEM or DMEM supplemented with FBS as required for each

58

cell line. For antiviral assays the same medium was used but with FBS reduced to 2%

59

or less and supplemented with 50 µg/ml gentamicin. The test compound is prepared at

60

four log10 final concentrations 0.1, 1.0, 10, and 100 µg/ml or µM. Five microwells are

61

used per dilution: three for infected cultures and two for uninfected toxicity cultures.

62

Controls for the experiment consist of six microwells that are infected (virus controls)

63

and six that are untreated (cell controls). The virus control and cell control wells are on

64

every microplate. In parallel, a known active drug is tested as a positive control drug

65

using the same method as is applied for test compounds. The positive control is tested

66

with each test run. The assay was initiated by first removing growth media from the 96-

67

well plates of cells. Then the test compound was applied in 0.1 ml volume to wells at

68

2X concentration. Virus, normally at <100 50% cell culture infectious doses (CCID50) in

69

0.1 ml volume, was placed in those wells designated for virus infection. Medium devoid

70

of virus was placed in toxicity control wells and cell control wells. Virus control wells

71

were treated similarly with virus.

72

maximum CPE is observed microscopically in virus control wells. The plates are then

73

stained with 0.011% neutral red for approximately two hours at 37oC in a 5% CO2

74

incubator. The neutral red medium was removed by complete aspiration, and the cells

75

rinsed 1X with phosphate buffered solution (PBS) to remove residual dye. PBS was

76

completely removed and the incorporated neutral red eluted with 50% Sorensen’s

77

citrate buffer/50% ethanol for at least 30 minutes. The dye content in each well was

78

quantified using a 96-well spectrophotometer at 540 nm wavelength. The 50% effective

(EC50, virus-inhibitory) concentrations and 50% cytotoxic (CC50, cell-inhibitory)

80

concentrations were then calculated by linear regression analysis. The quotient of CC50

81

divided by EC50 gives the selectivity index (SI50) value. Ideally compounds showing SI50

82

values >10 are considered active.

83
84

Tilorone has in vitro activity against CHIK and MERS. We identified promising

85

micromolar activities for Tilorone against CHIK and MERS-CoV with reasonable

86

selectivity indexes (Table 1). The in vitro activity against MERS also agrees with recent

87

findings of others (5). These combined observations along with earlier descriptions of

88

many antiviral activities suggest tilorone is a potential broad-spectrum antiviral that may

89

have utility against additional coronaviruses. While this drug is approved in Russia

90

Federation countries, Tilorone has never been evaluated and tested for safety and

91

efficacy under studies that meet current ICH and FDA guidelines and regulations.

92

Recent virus outbreaks such as SARS-CoV-2 suggest the urgent need for

93

reassessment of this compound as a broad-spectrum antiviral as we have yet to fully

94

appreciate the utility of this drug discovered 50 years ago.
