Introductory paragraph
Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19, the world is being shaken to its core with
numerous hospitalizations and hundreds of thousands of deaths. In search for key targets of effective
therapeutics, robust animal models mimicking COVID-19 in humans are urgently needed. Here, we
show that productive SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs of mice is limited and restricted by early
type I interferon responses. In contrast, we show that Syrian hamsters are highly permissive to SARSCoV-2 and develop bronchopneumonia and a strong inflammatory response in the lungs with
neutrophil infiltration and edema. Moreover, we identify an exuberant innate immune response as a
key player in pathogenesis, in which STAT2 signaling plays a dual role, driving severe lung injury on
the one hand, yet restricting systemic virus dissemination on the other. Finally, we assess SARS-CoV2-induced lung pathology in hamsters by micro-CT alike used in clinical practice. Our results reveal
the importance of STAT2-dependent interferon responses in the pathogenesis and virus control during
SARS-CoV-2 infection and may help rationalizing new strategies for the treatment of COVID-19
patients.

Introduction and Results
SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family of Coronaviridae, which contains a large group of viruses that are
constantly circulating in animals and humans. Illness in humans caused by coronaviruses is mostly
mild and manifested by respiratory or digestive problems as leading symptoms1. However, some
coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, have been
responsible for serious outbreaks of severe and lethal respiratory disease2,3. Unlike the previous

outbreaks with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has evolved to the
largest global health threat to humanity in this century.

The unprecedented scale and rapidity of the current pandemic urges the development of efficient
vaccines, antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs. A key step in expediting this process is to have
animal models that recapitulate and allow to understand viral pathogenesis, and that can in particular
be used to identify new drug targets and preclinically assess preventive and therapeutic
countermeasures.

Acute respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-1 and MERS infections is characterized by a
dysregulated inflammatory response in which a delayed type I interferon (IFN) response promotes the
accumulation of inflammatory monocyte-macrophages4–6. The severe lung disease in COVID-19
patients seems to result from a similar overshooting inflammatory response7. However, because even
non-human primates do not fully replicate COVID-19, little information and no appropriate animal
models are currently available to address this hypothesis8.

To address this knowledge gap, we compared the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in wild-type (WT)
mice of different lineages (BALB/c and C57BL/6) and Syrian hamsters, as well as a panel of matched
transgenic mouse and hamster strains with a knockout (KO) of key components of adaptive and innate
immunity. We used an original patient isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/Belgium/GHB-03021/2020)
that was passaged on HuH7 and Vero E6 cells for these studies (Fig. S1 and Fig. S2A). For full
characterization and to exclude possible contaminants, we performed deep sequencing on the
inoculum that was used to infect the animals (Fig. S2A). No adventitious agents could be detected
(data not shown). However, two in-frame deletions in the N-terminal domain and the furin-cleavage
site of Spike (S) glycoprotein (9aa and 5aa, respectively) had occurred between cell culture passage
P4 (mixed population of 85% WT genomes and 15% (9+5aa del) mutant genomes) and P6 (100%
(9+5aa del) mutant genomes)9–11, likely as adaptation to growth in Vero E6 cells in vitro (Fig. S2B).

To first examine whether adaptive immunity contributed to the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2
infection, we inoculated WT (immune-competent) and SCID mice (lacking functional T and B cells)
from the same BALB/c background intranasally with a high 2 × 105 TCID50 viral dose (P4 virus) (Fig.
1A). On day 3 p.i., a viral RNA peak in the lungs was observed (Fig. 1B and Fig. S3) with no obvious
differences in viral loads (Fig. 1B) nor lung pathology (Fig. 1D and Fig. S4A and S4B) between WT
and SCID mice. These data indicate that mice that lack the human ACE2 receptor12, can in principle
be infected with SARS-CoV-2, although inefficiently and likely transiently, as also observed for
SARS-CoV-14,13. However, adaptive immunity did not markedly contribute to this low susceptibility.

Interferons are the prototypic first-line innate immune defense against viral infections. To evaluate
interferons, we compared viral RNA levels and lung pathology in WT C57BL/6 mice, and C57BL/6
mice with a genetic ablation of their type I (Ifnar1-/-) and III interferon (IFN) receptors (Il28r-/-) (Fig.
1A). Ifnar1-/- mice showed an enhanced replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the lung on day 3 p.i.
compared to both WT and Il28r-/- mice (Fig. 1C). Similar to BALB/c mice, overall viral loads were
low. Ifnar1-/- mice that were treated prior to infection with human convalescent SARS-CoV-2 patient
serum or plasma that contains spike-specific antibodies (Fig. 1E, Fig. S4) had a 3-10-fold reduction in
viral loads depending on the patient donor. This provides further evidence for active, although
inefficient virus replication in Ifnar1-/- mice.

WT and knockout (Ifnar1-/-, Il28r-/-) mouse strains, all on C57BL/6 background, presented
consistently with only a mild lung pathology. However, Ifnar1-/- mice showed increased levels of
intra-alveolar hemorrhage, sometimes accompanied by some peribronchiolar inflammation (Fig. 1D
and Fig. S5A and S5B). Passive transfer of HCS did not result in an obvious improvement in
histopathological scores (Fig. S5C), in line with other studies about partial protection from SARSCoV-2 infection14,15 and virus-induced inflammatory responses. Further evidence for true infection
and hence viral replication is provided by transcriptomic analysis (Sharma, S. et al., in press16) of
infected lung tissues (Fig. 1F and Fig. S6), revealing (i) an upregulation of classical antiviral effector
molecules17 (enrichment p<0.001) such as cGAS, Mx1, IFIH1/MDA-5, IRF3, OAS1, OAS3 and
5

PKR/EIF2AK2 (Fig. S6, Cluster 1) and (ii) downregulation of upstream regulators STAT1, STAT3 and
STING/TMEM173 (Fig. S6, Cluster 3) in agreement with a possible role for apoptosis18–20. Likewise,
HCS treatment modulated, at least to some extent, the observed gene expression patterns (Fig. 1F and
Fig. S6, Cluster 2) as shown by decreasing Akt1 (p=0.034) or increasing DDX58 (RIG-I, p=0.028) and
cGAS (MB21D1, p=0.094) mRNA levels. In summary, our data are in line with restriction of SARSCoV-2 infection by the interferon system in mice, and also suggest limited inflammatory responses in
the lungs of mice, in contrast to COVID-19 in humans21. Taken together, mice were considered as a
poor model to study COVID-19 pathogenesis, or to assess the efficacy of vaccines and treatments.

In contrast, Syrian hamsters have been reported to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-122 and SARSCoV-223 and might thus provide a small animal model to study SARS‑CoV-induced pathogenicity and
the involvement of the immune response in aggravating lung disease. In contrast to mice, intranasal
inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 in WT hamsters resulted in high viral RNA loads (Fig. 2B, Fig. S7) a
proxy used for the quantification of viral loads (see Fig. S9C), and in actual infectious titers (Fig. 2C)
in the lungs, i.e. roughly 4 Log10 higher than in Ifnar-/- mice (Fig. 2C). Also, a marked lung pathology
[median cumulative score (MCS) 9 out of maximal score of 18; IQR=8.5-10.5 (P4 virus)]
characterized by a multifocal necrotizing bronchiolitis, massive leukocyte infiltration and edema was
observed in infected hamsters but not in mice (Fig. 2D and Fig. S8A-C). This resembles
histopathological findings in humans suffering from severe bronchopneumonia24.

In order to investigate the roles of type I and III IFN in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection,
we compared virus replication levels and lung pathology in WT hamsters and hamsters with ablated
Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 2 (STAT2-/- lacking type I and III IFN signaling)25,26
and IL28R expression (IL28R-a-/- lacking IFN type III signaling) (Fig. 2A). Of note, these receptor
knockouts did not affect ACE2 expression in hamster lungs (Fig. S9A), while interferon-stimulated
genes (ISG)27 such as MX-2 (strongly induced by IFNα/STAT2 signaling) and IP-10 (induced by both
type I and type II IFNs) showed a differential expression pattern when comparing the different
genotypes, triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. S9B). Importantly, lower baseline expression of

MX-2 and IP-10 and failure to respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection by MX-2 upregulation in STAT2-/hamsters confirmed the functional knockout. As expected, IL28R-a-/- hamsters showed an intermediate
phenotype between that of WT and STAT2-/- concerning their antiviral response. For many respiratory
viruses, including SARS-CoV-1, type I and III interferon signaling has been described to play an
important role in restricting infection28. No marked differences were observed in viral RNA levels in
the lung of WT, STAT2-/- or IL28R-a-/- hamsters (Fig. 2B). However, STAT2-/- hamsters had higher
titers of infectious virus in the lung (Fig. 2C), high titer viremia (measured by RT-qPCR and virus
titration)29 (Fig. 2E and Fig. S9C) and high levels of viral RNA in the spleen, liver and upper and
lower gastrointestinal tract30 (Fig. 2F) in comparison with WT and IL28R-a-/- hamsters. Interestingly,
only for the P4 virus and not the P6 virus, infectious virus could be observed in the blood. Together,
these data suggest STAT2 is critical for restricting SARS-CoV-2 systemic spread and suppressing
viral replication outside of the lung compartment. A similar effect was also observed in human Calu-3
cells where pharmacological inhibition of STAT signaling by Ruxolitinib could rescue virus
replication from the inhibitory activity of type I IFN (Fig. S9D), further underscoring the role of
STAT2 in controlling virus replication. Inversely, the observed lung pathology was much attenuated
in STAT2-/- hamsters [MCS=3; IQR=1.5-3 (P4 virus)] with a limited infiltration of polymorphonuclear
leukocytes correlated with the detection of few apoptotic bodies in the bronchus walls (Fig. 2D and
Fig. S8C). On the contrary, IL28R-a-/- hamsters showed clear signs of bronchopneumonia and
peribronchiolar inflammation, yet of an intermediate score [MCS=7; IQR=6.5-7 (P4 virus)] (Fig. 2D
and Fig. S8C). Matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-9 levels, which may serve as a sensitive marker for the
infiltration and activation of neutrophils in inflamed tissues31,32, were markedly elevated in the lungs
of all infected hamsters (Fig. 2G). However, higher MMP-9 levels were found in STAT2-/- animals,
thereby inversely correlating with the histological findings (Fig. 2D). In addition, biomarkers elevated
in critically ill COVID-19 patients2,7,33 such as the cytokines IL-6, IL-10 and IFN- were not found to
be elevated in the serum of infected hamsters (Fig. S10B), although mRNA levels of IP-10 (CXL-10)
were upregulated in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters as reported for other
cytokine/chemokines downstream of IFN- 23 (Fig. S9B). Nonetheless, infected STAT2-/- and IL28R-a-

/-

had clearly increased levels of IL-6 and IL-10 in their lungs (Fig. S10A). Such an inverse correlation

between biomarkers and pathology in WT versus STAT2-/- hamsters is in line with findings in mouse
models of SARS-CoV-1 infection in which pathology correlated with the induction and dysregulation
of alternatively activated “wound-healing” monocytes/macrophages4,6. To assess the utility of the
hamsters for testing the effect of therapeutic interventions on SARS-CoV-2 replication, WT hamsters
were treated with human convalescent plasma or a neutralizing SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2specific single-domain antibody Fc fusion construct (VHH-72-Fc)34 prior to infection (Fig. 2H).
Unlike a single dose of convalescent plasma, which did not significantly reduce viral load in the
lungs, pre-treatment with VHH-72-Fc reduced viral loads in the lung ~105-fold compared to untreated
control animals, validating hamsters as preclinical model for testing anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies.

The lack of readily accessible serum markers or the absence of overt disease symptoms in hamsters
prompted us to establish a non-invasive means to score for lung infection and SARS-CoV-2 induced
lung disease by computed tomography (CT) as used in standard patient care to aid COVID-19
diagnosis with high sensitivity and monitor progression/recovery7,33,35,36. Similar as in humans37, semiquantitative lung pathology scores were obtained from high-resolution chest micro-CT scans of freebreathing animals38. Pulmonary consolidations were present in SARS-CoV-2 infected WT and IL28Ra-/- hamsters, but not in STAT2-/- hamsters (Fig. 3A-B and Fig. S11A). In the upper airways, no
differences were observed between WT and STAT2-/- hamsters, whereas IL28R-a-/- hamsters presented
with an obvious dilation of bronchi (Fig. 3A and 3C). Further quantitative analysis39 revealed an
increase of the non-aerated lung volume in SARS-CoV-2-infected WT and IL28R-a-/- hamsters, yet
again not in STAT2-/- hamsters (Fig. 3D, Fig. S11B). Hence apart from lung consolidations and airway
dilation as the main observed pathology, marked differences in other micro-CT-derived markers of
specific lung pathology, such as hyperinflation, emphysema, or atelectasis39,40 were not be observed,
except in one animal that presented with hyperinflation (Fig. S11C and Fig. S12A-C). A matched
comparison of the micro-CT-derived lung scores and viral loads in the lungs showed that, in line with
our previous results, type I IFN responses downstream of STAT2 signaling drive lung pathology, yet

has minor impact on viral replication in the lungs (Fig. 3E). Together, these data fully support microCT as a convenient adjunct to histological scoring (Fig. 2D and Fig. S11D) to visualize and quantify
SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury in the hamster model. Moreover, it may allow to monitor the
impact of therapeutic measures non-invasively during disease progression.

Discussion
The development of efficient therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2 asks for relevant small
animal models that mimic the different clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and that provide
fundamental mechanistic insight into the underlying pathology/pathogenesis. Transgenic mice
expressing hACE2, the bona fide receptor of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-241, have been suggested
as COVID-19 model. We here demonstrate that WT mice are also susceptible to SARS-CoV-2
infection, yet resulting in very limited viral replication and inflammatory responses. Ablation of type I
interferon signaling in Ifnar-/- mice results in the same small incremental 10-fold increase in viral
replication as was reported for SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2 transgenic mice41,42. Most likely, neither
mouse model will fully recapitulate pathogenesis of COVID-19, nor allow the study of clinical
SARS-CoV-2 isolates. It remains of interest to investigate the added effect of both hACE2 knock-in
and IFNAR knockout in mice.

By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated pathology in hamsters seems to resemble what has
been reported for SARS-CoV-1 in the same model. An early peak of active virus replication was
noted in the lungs with viremia and extra-pulmonary spread. This was accompanied by a strong acute
inflammatory response22 (as visualized by histopathology), the levels of which were correlated with
those of MMP-9, a clinically relevant biomarker. Furthermore, micro-CT as established in this study
may become a key instrument to non-invasively and quantitatively monitor SARS-CoV-2 lung
disease. This will allow to conveniently monitor the effect of therapeutic strategies and test the
preclinical efficacy of vaccine candidates. Unlike in humans, IL-6, IL-10 and IFN- levels were not
elevated in SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters. However, the immune response in COVID-19 patients is

a dynamic process in which levels of these cytokine fluctuate over the different phases of disease
often peaking late7,43,44. By contrast, hamsters show a very acute and short-lived infection23 that may
not allow for the development of a similar cytokine storm that characterizes COVID-19 disease
progression in humans, considering that in our studies animals were sacrificed as early as day 4 p.i.
Nevertheless, the pathological findings in hamsters seem to resemble to a large extent what is
observed in humans, including histopathology, infiltration of PMN cells and consolidation as scored
by micro-CT.

By comparing data obtained from experiments using the P4 and P6 virus stocks, we observed a
possible attenuated in vivo fitness of the P6 stock (lower MMP-9 levels and less infectious virus and
viral RNA levels in blood) likely as a consequence of adaptation to enhanced growth in Vero cell
cultures. This observation is also in line with what others have reported, namely that tissue cultureadaptive mutations similar to those we have observed (Fig. S2) may result in reduced fitness of
SARS-CoV-2 in wild-type hamsters (no body weight loss and less severe pathology)45. These findings
emphasize the possible consequences of using cell culture-adapted virus when studying SARS-CoV-2
infection in animal models.

By using unique knock-out hamster lines and human Calu-3 cells, we demonstrated that STAT2 plays
a critical role in mediating antiviral responses and restricting systemic dissemination of SARS-CoV-2.
This is in line with the effect of STAT1 in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-1 infection46. However and
much in contrast to what is generally observed for viral infections in Stat2-/- mice47 or STAT2-/hamsters26,48,49, the severe pathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 in WT hamsters is not observed in the
absence of STAT2. Indeed, pneumonia as assessed by sensitive micro-CT was absent in STAT2-/hamsters. Considering the negative regulation of IL-6 and other mediators of inflammation by
STAT247,50, our hamster model may help to understand the immune pathogenesis of Acute Lung
Injury (ALI) caused by highly pathogenic coronaviruses22,28,51 as well as other respiratory viruses4. Of
note, a meta-analysis of infected human cells revealed a specific SARS-CoV-2-regulated

transcriptional footprint for STAT2 that was much stronger than that of any other inflammatory
transcription factor52.

The increase in replication of SARS-CoV-2 seen in IL28R-a-/- hamsters, on one hand, combined with
a tempered inflammatory response and lung injury as compared to WT hamsters, on the other hand, is
in line with the role of type III IFN plays during respiratory virus infections, including SARS-CoV153. This observation also suggests that in humans pegylated IFN-lambda54,55 (or similar modulators of
innate immunity) may possibly be considered to protect medical staff and other frontline workers
from SARS-CoV-2 infection or to dampen symptoms in critically ill patients56.

In conclusion, hamsters may be preferred above mice as infection model for the preclinical
assessment of antiviral therapies, of convalescent serum transfer and of approaches that aim at
tempering the COVID-19 immune pathogenesis in critically ill patients21,57. The latter may be
achieved by repurposing anti-inflammatory drugs58 such as IL-6 receptor antagonists (e.g.
Tocilizumab)59, or small molecule Jak/STAT inhibitors (e.g. Ruxolitinib or Tofacitinib). Educated by
our finding that STAT2 signaling plays a dual role in also limiting viral dissemination, targeting the
virus-induced cytokine response and overshooting of macrophage activation may need to be
complemented by (directly acting) antivirals60.

STAT2-/- and IL28R-a-/- hamsters were generated by CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene targeting. To ablate
STAT2 (Gene ID: 101830537) expression, a 1-nt frameshift mutation was introduced in exon 4
resulting in multiple premature stop codons25; to ablate IL28R (IFNLR1; Gene ID: 101833778)
expression, a 22-nucleotide deletion was introduced in exon 2 resulting in multiple premature stop
codons in the original open reading frame.
Animals were housed individually (hamsters) or per 5 (mice) in individually ventilated isolator cages
(IsoCage N Biocontainment System, Tecniplast) with access to food and water ad libitum, and cage
enrichment (cotton and cardboard play tunnels for mice, wood block for hamsters). Housing
conditions and experimental procedures were approved by the ethical committee of KU Leuven
(license P015-2020), following institutional guidelines approved by the Federation of European
Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA). Animals were euthanized by 100µl (mice) or
500µl (hamsters) of intraperitoneally administered Dolethal (200mg/ml sodium pentobarbital,
Vétoquinol SA). Animals were monitored daily for signs of disease (lethargy, heavy breathing or
ruffled fur).
Prior to infection, the animals were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of a xylazine (16 mg/kg,

solution. Each animal was inoculated intranasally by gently adding 50µl droplets of virus stock
containing 2 × 105 TCID50 (P4 virus) or 2 × 106 TCID50 (P6 virus) in both nostrils. Uninfected
animals did not receive any virus or matrix. Due to time constraints by the pandemic outbreak and the
urgency to develop a small animal model, we have used virus stock from two different passages (P4
and P6) to characterize our model. A full genotypic characterization of the viruses used is provided in
Fig. S2, and phenotypic differences and virus titers are provided in the text and legends.

supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Integro), 1% bicarbonate (Gibco), and 1% L-glutamine
(Gibco). For maintenance of Calu-3 cells (human airway epithelium, kind gift from Lieve Naesens,
KU Leuven, BE), the above medium was supplemented with 10mM HEPES (Gibco). All assays
involving virus growth were performed using 2% (Vero E6 and HuH7) or 0.2% (Calu-3) fetal bovine
serum instead of 10%.
SARS-CoV-2 strain BetaCov/Belgium/GHB-03021/2020 (EPI ISL 407976|2020-02-03) recovered
from a nasopharyngeal swab taken from a RT-qPCR-confirmed asymptomatic patient returning from
Wuhan, China beginning of February 202062 was directly sequenced on a MinION platform (Oxford
Nanopore) as described previously63. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed a close relation with the
prototypic Wuhan-Hu-1 2019-nCoV (GenBank accession number MN908947.3) strain. Infectious
virus was isolated by serial passaging on HuH7 and Vero E6 cells (see Fig. S1), with the addition of
penicillin/streptomycin, gentamicin and amphotericin B. Virus used for animal experiments was from
passages P4 and P6. Prior to inoculation of animals, virus stocks were confirmed to be free of
mycoplasma (PlasmoTest, InvivoGen) and other adventitious agents by deep sequencing on a MiSeq
platform (Illumina) following an established metagenomics pipeline64,65. The infectious content of
virus stocks was determined by titration on Vero E6 cells by the Spearman-Kärber method. All virusrelated work was conducted in the high-containment BSL3+ facilities of the KU Leuven Rega
Institute (3CAPS) under licenses AMV 30112018 SBB 219 2018 0892 and AMV 23102017 SBB 219
2017 0589 according to institutional guidelines.
Human convalescent serum (HCS) was donated under informed consent (Patient #1). Human
convalescent plasma (Patient #2) was obtained from Biobank Rode Kruis-Vlaanderen, registered
under Belgian law as Biobank BB190034 (Fig. S4). Plasma donated by a healthy volunteer sampled
prior to emergence of SARS-CoV-2 served as negative control (NC donor). Serum/plasma was
administered i.p. 1 day prior to infection, in a volume of 200µl per mouse and 1000µl per hamster.
Antibody VHH-72-Fc was administered i.p. at a dose of 20mg/kg 1 day prior to infection. VHH-72Fc was expressed in ExpiCHO cells (ThermoFisher Scientific) and purified from the culture medium
as described34. Briefly, after transfection with pcDNA3.3-VHH-72-Fc plasmid DNA, followed by
incubation at 32C and 5% CO2 for 6-7 days, the VHH-72-Fc protein in the cleared cell culture

medium was captured on a 5 mL MabSelect SuRe column (GE Healthcare), eluted with a McIlvaine
buffer pH 3, neutralized using a saturated Na3PO4 buffer, and buffer exchanged to storage buffer (25
mM L-Histidine, 125 mM NaCl). The antibody's identity was verified by protein- and peptide-level
mass spectrometry.

RNA extraction and RT-qPCR
Animals were euthanized at different time-points post-infection, organs were removed and lungs were
homogenized manually using a pestle and a 12-fold excess of cell culture medium (DMEM/2%FCS).
RNA extraction was performed from homogenate of 4 mg of lung tissue with RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen), or 50µl of serum using the NucleoSpin kit (Macherey-Nagel), according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Other organs were collected in RNALater (Qiagen) and homogenized in
a bead mill (Precellys) prior to extraction. Of 100µl eluate, 4µl was used as template in RT-qPCR
reactions. RT-qPCR was performed on a LightCycler96 platform (Roche) using the iTaq Universal
Probes One-Step RT-qPCR kit (BioRad) with primers and probes (Table S1) specific for SARS-CoV2, mouse β-actin (Actb) and hamster β-actin (ACTB), ACE2, MX2 and IP-10 (IDT). For each data
point, qPCR reactions were carried out in duplicate. Standards of SARS-CoV-2 cDNA (IDT) and
infectious virus were used to express the amount of RNA as normalized viral genome equivalent
(vge) copies per mg tissue, or as TCID50 equivalents per mL serum, respectively. The mean of
housekeeping gene β-actin was used for normalization. The relative fold change was calculated using
the 2-ΔΔCt method66.

Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 infectious particles in lung tissues
After extensive transcardial perfusion with PBS, lungs were collected, extensively homogenized using
manual disruption (Precellys24) in minimal essential medium (5% w/v) and centrifuged (12,000 rpm,
10min, 4°C) to pellet the cell debris. Infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles were quantified by means of
endpoint titrations on confluent Vero E6 cell cultures. Viral titers were calculated by the SpearmanKärber method and expressed as the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per 100mg tissue.

Differential gene expression and bioinformatics analysis
To study differential gene expression, RNA was extracted from lung tissues using Trizol, subjected to
cDNA synthesis (High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and
qPCR using a custom Taqman qRT-PCR array (Thermo Fisher Scientific) of 30 genes known to be
activated in response to virus infection16, as well as two housekeeping genes (Table S2). Data
collected were analysed using the Quant Studio Design and Analysis (version 1.5.1) and Data Assist
software (version 3.01, Thermo Fischer Scientific). Pathway, GO (Gene Ontology) and transcription
factor target enrichment analysis was performed using GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis,
Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB), Broad Institute). Principal component analysis, correlation
matrices, unsupervised hierarchical clustering (Eucledian distance) were performed using XLSTAT
and visualized using MORPHEUS (https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus) as described
previously20.

Histology
For histological examination, the lungs were fixed overnight in 4% formaldehyde and embedded in
paraffin. Tissue sections (4 µm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin to visualize and score for
lung damage.

In vitro JAK/STAT inhibition assay
Calu-3 (human airway epithelial) cells were plated at 5×104 cells/well in a 96-well plate and incubated
overnight with 4µM of the JAK1/2 inhibitor Ruxolitinib67 (Toronto Research Chemicals, ON, Canada).
Next day, cells were pre-treated for 4 hours with 10 IU/ml of Universal Type I IFN (PBL Assay Science,
NJ, USA, cat no. 11200) before infection with SARS-CoV-2 (P6, 5×104 TCID50 per well). Two hours
post infection, cells were washed with PBS and incubated for an additional 48h with IFN and
Ruxolitinib before collection of the supernatant for RNA extraction and quantification of virus yields
by RT-qPCR.

Tissue and serum biomarker analysis
Cytokine levels in lung homogenates and serum of hamsters were determined by ELISA for IFN-
(EHA0005), IL-6 (EHA0008) and IL-10 (EHA0006) following the manufacturer’s instructions
(Wuhan Fine Biotech Co., Ltd).
The levels of gelatinase B/metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 present in lung homogenates were analyzed
using gelatin zymography68, essentially as described previously69. For quantification of zymolytic
bands internal control samples were spiked into each sample. Equivalent hamster enzyme
concentrations were calculated with the use of known amounts of recombinant human pro-MMP-9
and recombinant human pro-MMP-9ΔOGHem as standards70.

Micro-computed tomography (CT) and image analysis
Hamsters were anaesthetized using isoflurane (Iso-Vet) (2-3% in oxygen) and installed in prone
position into the X-cube micro-CT scanner (Molecubes) using a dedicated imaging bed. Respiration
was monitored throughout. A scout view was acquired and the lung was selected for a non-gated,
helical CT acquisition using the High-Resolution CT protocol, with the following parameters: 50
kVp, 960 exposures, 32 ms/projection, 350 µA tube current, rotation time 120 s. Data were
reconstructed using a regularized statistical (iterative) image reconstruction algorithm using nonnegative least squares71, using an isotropic 100 µm voxel size and scaled to Hounsfield Units (HUs)
after calibration against a standard air/water phantom. The spatial resolution of the reconstruction was
estimated at 200 µm by minimizing the mean squared error between the 3D reconstruction of the
densest rod in a micro-CT multiple density rod phantom (Smart Scientific) summed in the axial
direction and a digital phantom consisting of a 2D disk of 17.5 mm radius that was post-smoothed
with Gaussian kernels using different full width half maxima (FWHM), after aligning the symmetry
axis of the rod to the z-axis.
Visualization and quantification of reconstructed micro-CT data was performed with DataViewer and
CTan software (Bruker micro-CT). As primary outcome parameter, a semi-quantitative scoring of
micro-CT data was performed as previously described38,39,72 with minor modifications towards
optimization for COVID-19 lung disease in hamsters. In brief, visual observations were scored (from

0 – 2 depending on severity, both for parenchymal and airway disease) on 5 different, predefined
transversal tomographic sections throughout the entire lung image for both lung and airway disease by
two independent observers (L.S. and G.V.V.) and averaged. Scores for the 5 sections were summed
up to obtain a score from 0 to 10 reflecting severity of lung and airway abnormalities compared to
scans of healthy, WT control hamsters. As secondary measures, image-derived biomarkers (nonaerated lung volume, aerated lung volume, total lung volume, the respective densities within these
volumes and large airways volume) were quantified as in38,72 for a manually delineated VOI in the
lung, avoiding the heart and main blood vessels. The threshold used to separate the airways and
aerated (grey value 0-55) from non-aerated lung volume (grey value 56-255) was set manually on an
8-bit greyscale histogram and kept constant for all data sets.

Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism Version 8 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for all statistical evaluations. The
number of animals and independent experiments that were performed is indicated in the legends to
figures. Statistical significance was determined using the non-parametric Mann Whitney U-test unless
mentioned otherwise. Values were considered significantly different at P values of ≤0.05.

Figure 1. Type I interferon signaling restricts infection of the lungs of mice. (A) Schematic
representation of SARS-CoV-2 inoculation schedule. Several wild-type (WT) and knock-out
mouse strains were intranasally inoculated with 2 × 105 TCID50 of passage 4 (P4) SARS-CoV2. On the indicated days post inoculation (d.p.i.), lungs were collected for determination of
viral RNA levels and scored for lung damage. (B-C) Normalized viral RNA levels in the lungs
of BALB/c WT (n=3) and SCID (n=3) mice and C57BL/6 WT (n=5), Ifnar1-/- (n=3-8) and
Il28r-/- (n=5) mice. At the indicated time intervals p.i., viral RNA levels were determined by
RT-qPCR, normalized against β-actin mRNA levels and transformed to estimate viral genome
equivalents (vge) content per weight of the lungs (Figure S2). For heat-inactivation, SARSCoV-2 was incubated for 30min at 56°C. Dotted line indicates lower limit of quantification
(LLOQ). The data shown are means ± SEM. (D) Histopathological scoring of lungs for all
different mouse strains. Mice were sacrificed on day 3 p.i. and lungs were stained with H&E
and scored for signs of lung damage (inflammation and hemorrhage). Scores are calculated as
percentage of the total maximal score. “No score" means not contributing to theoretical full
cumulative score of 100%. Numbers (n) of animals analyzed per condition are given in the
inner circle. (E) Viral RNA levels in Ifnar1-/- mice after treatment with anti-SARS-CoV-2
serum or plasma. Mice were either left untreated (IC, infection control), or treated
intraperitoneally one day before infection with convalescent serum (patient #1), convalescent
plasma (patient #2) or with negative control plasma (patient #3 NC, negative control) and
sacrificed on day 3 p.i. Viral RNA levels were determined in the lungs, normalized against βactin and fold-changes were calculated using the 2(-ΔΔCq) method compared to mean of IC. The
data shown are means ± SEM. (F) Heatmap showing gene expression profiles of 30 selected
marker genes in the lungs of uninfected and infected Ifnar1-/- mice that were either left

Figure 2. Exuberant innate response by STAT2 drives SARS-CoV-2-induced lung
pathology in hamsters. (A) Schematic representation of SARS-CoV-2 inoculation schedule.
WT, STAT2-/- and IL28R-a-/- hamster strains were intranasally inoculated with 2 × 105 TCID50
of passage 4 or 2 × 106 of passage 6 SARS-CoV-2. Outcomes derived from inoculation with
passage 4 or passage 6 SARS-CoV-2 is designated by circles (P4) or squares (P6). On the
indicated days post inoculation (d.p.i.), organs and blood were collected to determine viral
RNA levels, infectious viral load and score for lung damage. Viral loads in the indicated organs
were quantified by RT-qPCR (B, E and F) or virus titration (C). (B,F) Viral RNA levels in the
indicated organs were normalized against β-actin mRNA levels and transformed to estimate
viral genome equivalents (vge) content per weight of the lungs (Figure S5). (C) Infectious viral
loads in the lung are expressed as the number of infectious virus particles per 100 mg of lung
tissue. (E) Viral RNA levels in the blood were calculated from a standard of infectious virus
and expressed as TCID50 equivalents per ml blood. Dotted lines indicate lower limit of
quantification (LLOQ) or lower limit of detection (LLOD) (D) Histopathological scoring of
lungs. Hamsters were sacrificed on day 4 p.i. with passage 4 SARS-CoV-2 and lungs were
stained with H&E and scored for signs of lung damage (apoptotic bodies, necrotizing
bronchiolitis, edema, pneumonia and inflammation). Scores are calculated as percentage of the
total maximal score. (G) Levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 levels in lung
homogenates of SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters, relative to non-infected controls of the same
strain. Statistical significance was calculated between infected and non-infected animals within
each group. Values for infected animals (n=7 each) compiled from two independent
experiments using either P4 (n=3, circles) and P6 (n=4, squares) SARS-CoV-2. (H) Viral RNA
levels in hamsters after treatment with convalescent SARS-CoV-2 plasma or with a previously
described antibody. Hamsters were either left untreated (IC, infection control, n=5) or treated
with a single-domain antibody (VHH-72-Fc, n=4), convalescent plasma (patient #2, n=4) or
negative control plasma (patient #3 NC, negative control, n=4) and sacrificed on day 4 p.i.
Viral RNA levels were determined in the lungs, normalized against β-actin and fold-changes
were calculated using the 2(-ΔΔCq) method compared to the mean of IC. The data shown are
