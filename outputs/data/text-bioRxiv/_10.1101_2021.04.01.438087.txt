Abstract: New SARS-CoV-2 variants are continuously emerging with critical

36

implications for therapies or vaccinations. All 22 N-glycan sites of SARS-CoV-2 Spike

37

remain highly conserved among the variants B.1.1.7, 501Y.V2 and P.1, opening an

38

avenue for robust therapeutic intervention. Here we used a comprehensive library of

39

mammalian carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) to probe critical sugar residues on

40

the full-length trimeric Spike and the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2.

41

Two lectins, Clec4g and CD209c, were identified to strongly bind to Spike. Clec4g and

42

CD209c binding to Spike was dissected and visualized in real time and at single

43

molecule resolution using atomic force microscopy. 3D modelling showed that both

44

lectins can bind to a glycan within the RBD-ACE2 interface and thus interferes with

45

Spike binding to cell surfaces. Importantly, Clec4g and CD209c significantly reduced

46

SARS-CoV-2 infections. These data report the first extensive map and 3D structural

47

modelling of lectin-Spike interactions and uncovers candidate receptors involved in

48

Spike binding and SARS-CoV-2 infections. The capacity of CLEC4G and mCD209c

49

lectins to block SARS-CoV-2 viral entry holds promise for pan-variant therapeutic

50

interventions.

51

Introduction: COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infections has triggered a pandemic

52

massively disrupting health care, social and economic life. SARS-CoV-2 main entry

53

route into target cells is mediated by the viral Spike protein, which binds to angiotensin

54

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed on host cells (Monteil et al., 2020). The Spike

55

protein is divided into two subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 subunits comprises the

56

receptor binding domain (RBD) which confers ACE2 binding activity. The S2 subunit

57

mediates virus fusion with the cell wall following proteolytic cleavage (Hoffmann et al.,

58

2020; Shang et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020). Cryo-electron microscopy studies have

59

shown that the Spike protein forms a highly flexible homotrimer containing 22 N-

60

glycosylation sites each, 18 of which are conserved with the closely related SARS-

61

CoV which caused the 2002/03 SARS epidemic (Ke et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020).

62

Point mutations removing glycosylation sites of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein were

63

found to yield less infectious pseudo-typed viruses (Li et al., 2020). As Spike and RBD

64

glycosylation affect ACE2 binding and SARS-CoV-2 infections, targeting virus specific

65

glycosylation could be a novel means for therapeutic intervention.

66
67

Glycosylation of viral proteins ensures proper folding and shields antigenic viral

68

epitopes from immune recognition (Watanabe et al., 2020b; Watanabe et al., 2019).

69

To create this glycan shield, the virus hijacks the host glycosylation machinery and

70

thereby ensures the presentation of self-associated glycan epitopes. Apart from

71

shielding epitopes from antibody recognition, glycans can be ligands for lectin

72

receptors. For instance, mannose-specific mammalian lectins, like DC-SIGN (CD209)

73

or its homolog L-SIGN (CD299), are well known to bind to viruses like HIV-1 and also

74

SARS-CoV (Van Breedam et al., 2014). Lectin receptors are often expressed on

75

immune and endothelial cells and serve as pattern recognition receptors involved in

76

virus internalization and transmission (Osorio and Reis e Sousa, 2011). Recent

77

studies have characterized the recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike by previously

78

known virus-binding lectins, such as DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, MGL and MR (Gao et al.,

79

2020). Given that SARS-CoV-2 relies less on oligo-mannose-type glycosylation, as

80

compared to for instance HIV-1, and displays more complex-type glycosylation, it is

81

unknown if additional lectin receptors are capable of binding the Spike protein and

82

whether such interactions might have functional relevance in SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Results:

85

Preparation of the first near genome-wide lectin library to screen for novel

86

binders of Spike glycosylation.

87

To systematically identify lectins that bind to the trimeric Spike protein and RBD of

88

SARS-CoV-2, we searched for all annotated carbohydrate recognition domains

89

(CRDs) of mouse C-type lectins, Galectins and Siglecs. Of 168 annotated CRDs, we

90

were able to clone, express and purify 143 lectin-CRDs as IgG2a-Fc fusion proteins

91

from human HEK293F cells (Fig. 1A, table S1). The resulting dimeric lectin-Fc fusion

92

proteins (hereafter referred to as lectins) showed a high degree of purity (Fig. 1B). This

93

collection of lectins is, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive library of mammalian

94

CRDs.

95
96

We next recombinantly expressed monomeric RBD and full-length trimeric Spike

97

protein (hereafter referred to as Spike protein) in human HEK293-6E cells. Using mass

98

spectrometry, we characterized all 22 N-glycosylation sites on the full-length Spike

99

protein and 2 N-glycosylation sites on the RBD (Fig. 1C and table S2). Most of the

100

identified structures were in accordance with previous studies using full-length Spike

101

(Watanabe et al., 2020a) with the exception of N331, N603 and N1194, which

102

presented a higher structural variability of the glycan branches (Fig. 1C and table S2).

103

Importantly, the N-glycan sites of Spike are highly conserved among the sequenced

104

SARS-CoV-2 viruses including the emerging variants B.1.1.7, 501Y.V2 and P.1 (Fig

105

S1A, B). The detected N-glycan species ranged from poorly processed oligo-mannose

106

structures to highly processed multi-antennary complex N-glycans in a site-dependent

107

manner. This entailed also a large variety of terminal glycan epitopes, which could act

108

as ligands for lectins. Notably, the two glycosylation sites N331 and N343 located in

109

the RBD carried more extended glycans, including sialylated and di-fucosylated

110

structures, when expressed as an independent construct as opposed to the full-length

111

Spike protein (Fig. 1C and table S2). These data underline the complex glycosylation

112

of Spike and reveal that N-glycosylation of the RBD within the 3D context of full-length

113

trimeric Spike is different from N-glycosylation of the RBD expressed as minimal ACE2

114

binding domain.

115
116

CD209c and Clec4g are novel high affinity binders of SARS-CoV-2 Spike.

117

We evaluated the reactivity of our murine lectin library against the trimeric Spike and

118

monomeric RBD of SARS-CoV-2 using an ELISA assay (Fig. S2A). This screen

119

revealed that CD209c (SIGNR2), Clec4g (LSECtin), and Reg1 exhibited pronounced

120

binding to Spike, whereas Mgl2 and Asgr1 displayed elevated binding to the RBD (Fig.

121

2A, B and table S3). Further, we investigated the reactivity of the lectin library against

122

human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2); none of the lectins bound to hrsACE2

123

(Fig. S2B). We excluded Reg1 from further studies due to inconsistent ELISA results,

124

likely due to protein instability. Asgr1 was excluded because it bound only to RBD but

125

not to the Spike trimer, in accordance to the differences in glycosylation of glycosites

126

N331 and N343 between Spike and RBD (Fig. 1C). This highlights the importance of

127

using a full-length trimeric Spike protein for functional studies. To confirm that the

128

observed interactions were independent of protein conformation, Spike was denatured

129

prior to the ELISA assay; binding of CD209c and Clec4g to the unfolded Spike

130

remained unaltered (Fig. 2C). Importantly, enzymatic removal of N-glycans by

131

PNGase F treatment reduced the binding of CD209c, Clec4g, and Mgl2 towards Spike

132

(Fig. 2D and Fig. S2C), confirming N-glycans as ligands. Binding of ACE2, which relies

133

on protein-protein interactions, was completely abrogated when Spike was denatured

134

(Fig. 2C). These data identify lectins that have the potential to bind to the RBD and

135

trimeric Spike of SARS-CoV-2.

136
137

Based on the robust N-glycan dependent Spike binding, we focused our further studies

138

on CD209c and Clec4g. We first used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to determine

139

the kinetic and equilibrium binding constants of these lectins to the trimeric Spike. The

140

resulting experimental binding curves were fitted to the ‚Äúbivalent analyte model‚Äù

141

(Traxler et al., 2017) which assumes two-step binding of the lectin dimers to adjacent

142

immobilized Spike trimer binding sites (Fig. 2E, F). From these fits, we computed the

143

kinetic association (ka,1), kinetic dissociation (kd,1), and equilibrium dissociation (Kd,1)

144

binding constants of single lectin bonds (Table 1). The equilibrium dissociations (Kd,1)

145

values were 1.6 ŒºM and 1.0 ŒºM for Clec4g and CD209c, respectively.

146
147

Multiple CD209c and Clec4g molecules bind simultaneously to SARS-CoV-2

148

Spike and form compact complexes.

149

To study Spike binding of these two lectins at the single-molecule level, we used

150

atomic force microscopy (AFM) and performed single molecule force spectroscopy

151

(SMFS) experiments. To this end, we coupled trimeric Spike to the tip of the AFM

152

cantilever and performed single-molecule force measurements (Hinterdorfer et al.,

153

1996), by moving the Spike trimer-coupled tip towards the surface-bound lectins to

154

allow for bond formations (Fig. 3A). Unbinding was accomplished by pulling on the

155

bonds, which resulted in characteristic downward deflection signals of the cantilever,

156

whenever a bond was ruptured (Fig. 3B). The magnitude of these vertical jumps

157

reflects the unbinding forces, which were of typical strengths for specific molecular

158

interactions (Rankl et al., 2008). Using this method (Rankl et al., 2008; Zhu et al.,

159

2010), we quantified unbinding forces (Fig. 3C) and calculated the binding probability

160

and the number of bond ruptures between CD209c or Clec4g and trimeric Spike (Fig.

161

3D). Both lectins showed a very high binding probability and could establish up to 3

162

strong bonds with accumulating interaction force strengths reaching 150 pN in total

163

with trimeric Spike (Fig. 3C), with the preference of single and dual bonds (Fig. 3C,

164

3D, Fig. S3A, B, Table 1). Of note, multi-bond formation leads to stable complex

165

formation, in which the number of formed bonds enhances the overall interaction

166

strength and dynamic stability of the complexes. To assess dynamic interactions

167

between single molecules of trimeric Spike and the lectins in real time we used high-

168

speed AFM (Kodera et al., 2010; Preiner et al., 2014). Addition of Clec4g and CD209c

169

led to a volume increase of the lectin/Spike complex in comparison to the trimeric

170

Spike alone; based on the volumes we could calculate that on average 3.2 molecules

171

of Clec4g and 5.2 molecules of CD209c were bound to one Spike trimer (Fig. 3E, Fig.

172

S3C-E and movies S1-4). These data show, in real-time, at single molecule resolution,

173

that mouse Clec4g and CD209c can directly associate with trimeric Spike.

175

The human lectins CD209 and CLEC4G are high affinity receptors for SARS-

176

CoV-2 Spike.

177

Having characterized binding of murine CD209 and Clec4g to Spike, we next

178

assessed whether their closest human homologues, namely human CD209 (hCD209),

179

and human CD299 (hCD299) for murine CD209c, and human CLEC4G (hCLEC4G)

180

for mouse Clec4g, can also bind to full-length trimeric Spike of SARS-CoV-2. hCD209,

181

hCD299, and hCLEC4G indeed exhibited binding to Spike (Fig. 4A), demonstrating

182

conserved substrate specificities. The binding of these human lectins was again

183

independent of Spike folding and abrogated by N-glycan removal (Fig. 4A, B). SPR

184

measurements of hCLEC4G and hCD209 bond formation to Spike showed equilibrium

185

dissociation (Kd,1) values of 0.3 ¬µM and 2.4 ŒºM, respectively, in which the high affinity

186

of hCLEC4G is mainly contributed by its rapid kinetic association rate constant (Fig.

187

4C, D and Table 1). In addition, hCD209 and hCLEC4G showed a high binding

188

probability by AFM with the formation of up to 3 bonds per trimeric Spike (Fig. S4A-

189

C). When we monitored the dynamic interactions of the lectins with the Spike using

190

high speed AFM, we observed binding of - on average - 3.5 hCLEC4G and 3.6

191

hCD209 molecules per trimeric Spike (Fig. 4E and Fig. S4D-F). In summary, our data

192

using ELISA, SMFS, surface plasmon resonance, and high-speed atomic force

193

microscopy show that the human lectins CLEC4G and CD209 can bind to trimeric

194

Spike of SARS-CoV-2, in which the overall interaction strength and dynamic stability

195

leads to compact complex formation.

196
197

CLEC4G sterically interferes with Spike/ACE2 interaction. We next 3D modelled

198

binding of hCLEC4G and hCD209 to the candidate glycosylation sites present on

199

Spike and how such attachment might relate to the binding of the trimeric Spike protein

200

to its receptor ACE2. hCD209 is known to bind with high affinity to oligo-mannose

201

structures (Guo et al., 2004). The N234 glycosylation site is the only site within the

202

Spike that carries exclusively oligo-mannose glycans with up to 9 mannose residues

203

(Fig. 1C, table S2). 3D modelling revealed that the oligo-mannose glycans on N234

204

are accessible for hCD209 binding on all 3 monomers comprising the trimeric Spike

205

(Fig. 5 and Fig. S5A, B). Superimposition of ACE2 interacting with the RBD and

206

hCD209 binding to N234, showed that the hCD209 binding occurs at the lateral

207

interface of Spike, distant from the RBD (Fig. 5)

208
209

Human CLEC4G and mouse Clec4g, on the other hand, were shown to have a high

210

affinity for complex N-glycans terminating with GlcNAc (Pipirou et al., 2011;

211

Powlesland et al., 2008). To further assess the detailed ligand specificity of these two

212

lectins, we performed glycan microarray analyses comprising of 144 different glycan

213

structures. Our analysis revealed a remarkable specificity of both, human CLEC4G

214

and mouse Clec4g, exclusively for N-glycans with an unsubstituted GlcNAcŒ≤-

215

1,2ManŒ±-1,3Man arm (Fig. 5A, Fig. S6A, B, and Table S4). In addition, our analysis

216

revealed that mouse CD209c exhibits overlapping ligand specificities with murine

217

Clec4g and human CLEC4G, which is in fact distinct from the known binding profile of

218

human CD209. However, unlike Clec4g, CD209c recognized all N-glycan structures

219

that displayed terminal unsubstituted GlcNAc residues, independently of the position

220

in the glycan antennae (Fig. 5A, Fig. S6C and Table S4). The N-glycan at N343,

221

located within the RBD, is the glycosylation site most abundantly decorated with

222

terminal GlcNAc in Spike (Fig. 1C, table S2), constituting the candidate binding site

223

for murine CD209c and murine and human CLEC4G.

225

The terminal GlcNAc glycans on position N343 are accessible for hCLEC4G binding

226

on all 3 Spike monomers, but in contrast to hCD209, hCLEC4G binding interferes with

227

the ACE2/RBD interaction (Fig. 5B, fig. S5C, D). Since murine Clec4g and murine

228

CD209c show strongly overlapping ligand specificities to hCLEC4G, we next modelled

229

binding of these two lectins to the N343 glycan site. As predicted from our data, both

230

murine Clec4g and murine CD209c indeed interfere with the ACE2/RBD interaction

231

(fig. S5E). Thus, whereas hCD209 is not predicted to directly affect ACE2/RBD

232

binding, murine Clec4g, murine CD209c and human CLEC4G binding to the N343

233

glycan impedes Spike binding to ACE2.

234
235

CD209c and CLEC4G block SARS-CoV-2 infection.

236

To test our structural models experimentally, we assessed whether these lectins could

237

interfere with Spike binding to the surface of Vero E6 cells, a frequently used SARS-

238

CoV-2 infection model (Monteil et al., 2020). To determine this, we set-up an AFM

239

based method, measuring spike binding activity on Vero E6 cells. Strikingly, as

240

predicted by the structural modelling, we found that hCLEC4G, but not hCD209,

241

significantly interfered with the binding of trimeric Spike to the Vero E6 cell surface

242

(Fig. 6A). Similarly, mouse Clec4g, and importantly also murine CD209c, albeit to a

243

lesser extent, interfered with Spike binding to Vero E6 cells (Fig. 6B). Finally, we tested

244

the ability of these lectins to reduce the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. In accordance with

245

our model, murine Clec4g and murine CD209c significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2

246

infection of Vero E6 cells (Fig. 6C). Finally, hCLEC4G also significantly reduced

247

SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells (Fig.6D). These data uncover that the lectins

248

CLEC4G and CD209c can interfere with SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Discussion

251

Here we report the results from unbiased screening of a comprehensive mammalian

252

lectin library for potent SARS-CoV-2 Spike binding, identifying mouse CD209c and

253

Clec4g, as well as their human homologs hCD209 and hCLEC4G, as N-glycan

254

dependent Spike receptors. hCD209 has been identified as candidate receptor for

255

SARS-CoV-2 by other groups, and other lectins have been also implicated in cellular

256

interactions with Spike (Gao et al., 2020; Th√©paut et al., 2020). CLEC4G has been

257

reported to associate with SARS-CoV (Gramberg et al., 2005), but has not been

258

implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infections. High-speed atomic force microscopy allowed us

259

to directly observe Spike/lectin interactions in real time. Our high-speed AFM data

260

showed that Spike/CLEC4G form more rigid clusters with lower conformational

261

flexibility as compared to the Spike/CD209 complexes in equilibrium conditions. This

262

is in accordance with faster association rates and shorter dissociation paths of

263

CLEC4G as compared to CD209. The experimentally observed association of 3-4

264

CLEC4G molecules with one molecule of the trimeric spike indicates the formation of

265

high affinity bonds to 1-2 glycosylation sites per monomeric subunit of the trimeric

266

Spike.

267

Since glycosylation is not a template driven process, but rather depends on the

268

coordinated action of many glycosyltransferases and glycosidases (Stanley et al.,

269

2015), each glycosylation site can - within some boundaries - carry a range of glycans.

270

As a consequence, the 3 monomers of Spike can harbor different glycans on the same

271

glycosylation site. We identified N343 as the one glycosylation site that is almost

272

exclusively covered with GlcNAc terminated glycans, the ligands of human CLEC4G

273

and mouse Clec4g as well as, based on our new data, mouse CD209c. Given

274

localization of N343 within the RBD, we hypothesized that CLEC4G and mCD209c

binding interferes with the RBD-ACE2 interaction. Indeed, we found that murine

276

Clec4g and human CLEC4G, acting as a multi-valent effective inhibitor (KI ~ 35 ‚Äì 70

277

nM), can functionally impede with Spike binding to host cell membranes, thereby

278

providing a rationale how this lectin can affect SARS-CoV-2 infections. In support of

279

our data, it has recently been reported that a N343 glycosylation mutant exhibits

280

reduced infectivity using pseudo-typed viruses (Li et al., 2020).

281
282

As for murine CD209c, our atomic force microscopy data indicate that CD209c

283

engages in a larger number of interactions per trimeric Spike (~ 5.2), presumably

284

because mCD209c binds to a greater variety of GlcNAc-linkages than Clec4g. This

285

more promiscuous glycan binding of mCD209c might also explain less, albeit

286

significant, inhibition of Spike binding to VeroE6 surface as compared to human and

287

mouse CLEC4G. Interestingly, the efficiency of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection

288

between murine and human CLEC4G and mCD209c remained comparable. As such,

289

the multi-valent binding of CD209c may block SARS-CoV-2 infection not only through

290

direct interference with ACE2 binding, but possibly also via affecting conformational

291

Spike structures or proteolytic cleavage. Of note, while human and mouse CLEC4G

292

as well as mouse CD209c can interfere with RBD-ACE2 binding, human CD209 does

293

apparently not associate with glycans near the RBD and hence does not block Spike

294

binding to cells. This is in agreement to its proposed high affinity oligo-mannosidic

295

ligands, presented at N234, which is localized at a distance to the RBD-ACE2

296

interface.

297
298

Lectins play critical roles in multiple aspects of biology such as immune responses,

299

vascular functions, or as endogenous receptors for various human pathogens. Hence,

300

our library containing 143 lectins will now allow to comprehensively probe and map

301

glycan structures on viruses, bacteria or fungi, as well as during development or on

302

cancer cells, providing novel insights on the role of lectin-glycosylation interactions in

303

infections, basic biology, and disease. For instance, CD209 is expressed by antigen

304

presenting dendritic cells, as well as inflammatory macrophages (Garcia-Vallejo and

305

van Kooyk, 2013) and is known to bind to a variety of pathogens, like HIV and Ebola,

306

but also Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Candida albicans (Appelmelk et al., 2003).

307

CLEC4G is strongly expressed in liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cells

308

and can also be found on stimulated dendritic cells and macrophages (Dominguez-

309

Soto et al., 2009; Dominguez-Soto et al., 2007). CD299, one of the two homologues

310

of mouse CD209c, which we also identified to possess Spike binding ability, is co-

311

expressed with CLEC4G on liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cells (Liu et

312

al., 2004). Sinusoidal endothelial cells are important in the innate immune response,

313

by acting as scavengers for pathogens as well as antigen cross-presenting

314

cells (Knolle and Wohlleber, 2016). Thus, lectin binding to Spike might couple SARS-

315

CoV-2 infections to antiviral immunity, which needs to be further explored. Since viral

316

protein glycosylation depends on the glycosylation machineries of the infected cells

317

which assemble viral particles (Watanabe et al., 2019), slight changes in glycosylation

318

might explain differences in anti-viral immunity and possibly severity of the disease,

319

with critical implications for vaccine designs. Moreover, Spike-binding lectins could

320

enhance viral entry in tissues with low ACE2 expression, thus extending the organ

321

tropism of SARS-CoV-2.

322
323

Intriguingly, all 22 N-glycan sites of Spike remain highly conserved among all the

324

predominant SARS-CoV-2 variants, indicating a selection pressure to preserve these

326

entry holds promise for pan-variant therapeutic interventions.

Material and Methods:

329

Identification of proteins containing carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs).

330

Mouse lectin sequences were obtained using a domain-based approach. Briefly,

331

proteins with a C-type lectin-like/IPR001304 domain were downloaded from InterPro

332

66.0 and supplemented with proteins obtained in jackhmmer searches using the

333

PF00059.20 lectin C-type domain definition versus the mouse-specific UniProt and

334

Ensembl databases. The collected set of candidate mouse lectins was made non-

335

redundant using nrdb 3.0. The C-type lectin-like regions were extracted from the full-

336

length proteins using the SMART CLECT domain definition with hmmersearch v3.1b2

337

and extended by 5 amino acids on both sides. To reduce redundancy, principal

338

isoforms were selected using appris 2016_10.v24. In addition, the CRD domains for

339

Galectins and Siglecs were added. In case a gene contained more than 1 CRD, all

340

CRDs were cloned separately and differentiated by _1, _2, etc.

341
342

Cloning of C-type lectin expression vectors.

343

We used the pCAGG_00_ccb plasmid and removed the toxic ccb element by cleaving

344

the plasmid with BsaI. Thereafter, we inserted a Fc-fusion construct, consisting of the

345

IL2 secretion signal, followed by an EcoRV restriction site, a (GGGS) 3 linker domain

346

and the mouse IgG2a-Fc domain. Subsequently, each identified CRD, was cloned in-

347

frame into the EcoRV site.

350

The CRD containing plasmids were transfected into FreestyleTM 293-F cells. Briefly,

351

the day before transfection, 293-F cells were diluted to 0.7x106 cells/ml in 30 ml

352

FreestyleTM 293-F medium and grown at 120 rpm at 37¬∞C with 8% CO2. The next

357

the contents of tube A and B were mixed, vortexed for 1 min and incubated at room

358

temperature for 15 min. Thereafter, the transfection mixture was added to the cell

359

suspension. 24h after transfection, EX-CELL 293 Serum-Free Medium (Sigma Aldrich,

360

14571C) was added to a final concentration of 20%. The transfected cells were grown

376

at 100g for 5 sec. Lectin-mIgG2a fusion proteins were eluted from the protein A beads

377

by resuspending the beads in 1 bead volume of Elution buffer (100mM Glycine-HCl,

378

pH=2-3, 0.02% sodium azide). After 30 sec of incubation the elution buffer was

379

collected into a 2 ml Eppendorf tube, containing Neutralization buffer (1M Tris, pH=9.0,

380

0.02% sodium azide) by centrifugation at 100g for 15 sec. Elution was performed for

381

a total of 3 times. The 3 eluted fractions were pooled and the protein concentrations

382

measured with the Pierce‚Ñ¢ BCA Protein Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, 23225)

383

using the Pierce‚Ñ¢ Bovine Gamma Globulin Standard (ThermoFisher Scientific,

384

23212). To confirm the purity of the eluted lectin-IgG fusion proteins, we performed an

385

SDS-PAGE, followed by a Coomassie staining. Briefly, 1 Œºg of eluted lectin-IgG fusion

386

protein was mixed with Sample Buffer, Laemmli 2x Concentrate (Sigma-Aldrich,

387

S3401) and heated to 95¬∞C for 5 minutes. Thereafter, the samples were loaded onto

388

NuPageTM 4-12% Bis-Tris gels (ThermoFisher Scientific, NP0321BOX) and run in 1x

389

MOPS buffer at 140V for 45 minutes. The gel was subsequently stained with

390

InstantBlueTM Safe Coomassie Stain (Sigma-Aldrich, ISB1L) for 1h and de-stained

391

with distilled water. The gel picture was acquired with the ChemiDoc MP Imaging

392

System (BioRad) in the Coomassie setting.

Purification of recombinant trimeric Spike protein and monomeric RBD of

426

SARS-CoV-2.

427

For purification, the supernatants were filtered through 0.45 Œºm membrane filters

428

(Merck Millipore HAWP04700), concentrated and diafiltrated against 20 mM

429

phosphate buffer containing 500 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole (pH 7.4) using a

430

Labscale TFF system equipped with a 5 kDa cut-off PelliconTM XL device (Merck

431

Millipore, PXC005C50). His-tagged trimer Spike and monomeric RBD were captured

432

using a 5 mL HisTrap FF crude column (Cytiva, 17528601) connected to an √ÑKTA

433

pure chromatography system (Cytiva). Bound proteins were eluted by applying a linear

434

gradient of 20 to 500 mM imidazole over 20 column volumes. Fractions containing the

435

protein of interest were pooled, concentrated using Vivaspin 20 Ultrafiltration Units

436

(Sartorius, VS2011) and dialyzed against PBS (pH 7.4) at 4¬∞C overnight using a

437

SnakeSkin Dialysis Tubing (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 68100). The RBD was further

438

polished by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex

439

200 pg column (Cytiva, 28-9893-35) equilibrated with PBS (pH 7.4). Both purified

440

proteins were stored at -80¬∞C until further use.

Glycoproteomic analysis of Spike and RBD.

443

Peptide mapping and glycoproteomic analysis of all samples were performed on in-

444

solution proteolytic digests of the respective proteins by LC-ESI-MS(/MS). In brief, the

445

pH of the samples was adjusted to pH 7.8 by the addition of 1 M HEPES, pH 7.8 to a

446

final concentration of 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.8. The samples were then chemically

447

reduced and S-alkylated using a final concentration of 10 mM dithiothreitol for 30 min

448

at 56¬∞C and a final concentration of 20 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at room-

analysis, proteins were digested with either Trypsin (Promega), a combination of

451

Trypsin and GluC (Promega) or Chymotrypsin (Roche). Eventually, all proteolytic

452

digests were acidified by addition of 10% formic acid to pH 2 and directly analyzed by

453

LC-ESI-MS(/MS) using an a capillary BioBasic C18 reversed-phase column (BioBasic-

454

18, 150 x 0.32 mm, 5 Œºm, Thermo Scientific), installed in an Ultimate U3000 HPLC

455

system (Dionex), developing a linear gradient from 95% eluent A (80 mM ammonium

456

formate, pH 3.0, in HPLC-grade water) to 65% eluent B (80% acetonitrile in 80 mM

457

ammonium formate, pH 3.0) over 50 min, followed by a linear gradient from 65% to

458

99% eluent B over 15 min, at a constant flow rate of 6 ŒºL/min, coupled to a maXis 4G

459

Q-TOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics; equipped with the standard ESI source). For

460

(glyco)peptide detection and identification, the mass-spectrometer was operated in

461

positive ion DDA mode (i.e. switching to MS/MS mode for eluting peaks), recording

462

MS-scans in the m/z range from 150 to 2200 Th, with the 6 highest signals selected

463

for MS/MS fragmentation. Instrument calibration was performed using a commercial

464

ESI calibration mixture (Agilent). Site-specific profiling of protein glycosylation was

465

performed using the dedicated Q-TOF data-analysis software packages Data Analyst

the plate was washed 3 times with 300 ¬µl of wash buffer (1xTBS, 1mM CaCl 2, 2mM

477

MgCl2, 0.25% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, T8787)). Unspecific binding was blocked

10108-H05H) or recombinant human ACE2-hIgG1 (2 Œºg/ml, diluted in blocking buffer,

486

Sino Biological, 10108-H02H) were added for 1h at room temperature. After washing

487

for 3 times, 100 ÔÅ≠l of 0.2 Œºg/ml HRP-conjugated goat anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) (Thermo

488

489

were added for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, plates were washed as

490

described above. To detect binding, 1 tablet of OPD substrate (Thermo Fisher

491

Scientific, 34006) was dissolved in 9 ml of deionized water and 1ml of 10x Pierce‚Ñ¢

492

Stable Peroxide Substrate Buffer (Thermo Fisher, Scientific, 34062). 100 ÔÅ≠l of OPD

substrate solution were added per well and incubated for 15 min at room temperature.

494

The reaction was stopped by adding 75 ÔÅ≠l of 2.5M sulfuric acid and absorption was

495

read at 490 nm. Absorption was measured for each lectin-Fc fusion protein tested

500

To denature the full-length Spike-H6, 10 mM DTT was added to 40 Œºg/ml of protein.

501

The samples were incubated at 85¬∞C for 10 min. Thereafter, the denatured proteins

502

were diluted to 4 Œºg/ml with PBS and a clear flat-bottom Maxisorp 96-well plate was

503

coated with 50 ÔÅ≠l per well for 2h at 37¬∞C. To remove the N-glycans from the full-length

504

Spike-H6, 0.2 Œºg protein were denatured as above and adjusted to a final

505

concentration of 1x Glycobuffer 2 containing 125U PNGase F per Œºg (NEB, P0704S)

506

in 50 Œºl. After incubation for 2h at 37¬∞C, the reaction was stopped by heat-inactivation

507

for 10 min at 75¬∞C. Spike proteins were then diluted to 4 Œºg/ml with PBS and a clear

508

flat-bottom Maxisorp 96-well plate was coated with 50 ¬µl per well for 2h at 37¬∞C. ELISA

509

protocols were performed as described above. To confirm the de-glycosylation of

Spike proteins, 0.5 Œºg were loaded on an SDS-PAGE gel followed by a Coomassie

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements.

514

A commercial SPR (BIAcore X, GE Healthcare, USA) was used to study the kinetics

515

of binding and dissociation of lectin-Fc dimers to the trimeric full-length Spike in real

516

time. Spike-H6 was immobilized on a Sensor Chip NTA (Cytiva, BR100034) via its

520

the lectin samples (murine Clec4g, murine CD209c, human CLEC4G, human CD209)

521

were injected at different concentrations (10 to 500 nM). As the binding of the lectins

522

is Ca2+ dependent, lectins were removed from the surface by washing with degassed

(1 RU = 0.0001¬∞). The resulting experimental binding curves were fitted to the ‚Äúbivalent

526

analyte model‚Äù, assuming a two-step binding of the lectins to immobilized Spike. All

527

evaluations were done using the BIAevaluation 3.2 software (BIAcore, GE Healthcare,

528

Single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) measurements.

531

For single molecule force spectroscopy a maleimide-Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)

532

linker was attached to 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES)-coated atomic force

533

microscopy (AFM) cantilevers by incubating the cantilevers for 2h in 500 ¬µL of

534

chloroform containing 1 mg of maleimide-PEG-N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)

535

(Polypure, 21138-2790) and 30 ¬µl of triethylamine. After 3 times washing with

536

chloroform and drying with nitrogen gas, the cantilevers were immersed for 2h in a

537

mixture of 100 ¬µL of 2 mM thiol-trisNTA, 2 ¬µL of 100 mM EDTA (pH 7.5), 5 ¬µL of 1 M

538

HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 ¬µl of 100 mM tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) hydrochloride,

539

and 2.5 ¬µL of 1 M HEPES (pH 9.6) buffer, and subsequently washed with HEPES-

540

buffered saline (HBS). Thereafter, the cantilevers were incubated for 4h in a mixture

541

of 4 ¬µL of 5 mM NiCl2 and 100 ¬µL of 0.2 ¬µM His-tagged Spike trimers. After washing

542

with HBS, the cantilevers were stored in HBS at 4¬∞C (Oh et al., 2016). For the coupling

543

of lectins to surfaces, a maleimide-PEG linker was attached to an APTES-coated

544

silicon nitride surface. First, 2 Œºl of 100 mM TCEP, 2 Œºl of 1M HEPES (pH 9.6), 5 Œºl of

545

1M HEPES (pH 7.5), and 2 Œºl of 100 mM EDTA were added to 100 Œºl of 200 Œºg/ml

546

Protein A-Cys (pro-1992-b, Prospec, NJ, USA) in PBS. The surfaces were incubated

547

in this solution for 2h and subsequently washed with PBS and 0.02 M sodium

548

phosphate containing 0.02% sodium azide, pH=7.0. Finally, 100 Œºl of 200 Œºg/ml lectin-

549

Fc fusion proteins were added to the surfaces overnight.

551

Force distance measurements were performed at room temperature (~25 ¬∫C) with 0.01

552

N/m nominal spring constants (MSCT, Bruker) in TBS buffer containing 1 mM CaCl 2

553

and 0.1 % TWEEN-20. Spring constants of AFM cantilevers were determined by

554

measuring the thermally-driven mean-square bending of the cantilever using the

555

equipartition theorem in an ambient environment. The deflection sensitivity was

556

calculated from the slope of the force-distance curves recorded on a bare silicon

557

substrate. Determined spring constants ranged from 0.008 to 0.015 N/m. Force-

558

distance curves were acquired by recording at least 1000 curves with vertical sweep

559

rates between 0.5 and 10 Hz at a z-range of typically 500 ‚Äì 1000 nm (resulting in

560

loading rates from 10 to 10,000 pN/s), using a commercial AFM (5500, Agilent

561

Technologies, USA). The relationship between experimentally measured unbinding

562

forces and parameters from the interaction potential were described by the kinetic

563

models of Bell (Bell, 1978) and Evans and Ritchie (Evans and Ritchie, 1997). In

564

addition, multiple parallel bond formation was calculated by the Williams model

565

(Williams, 2003) from the parameters derived from single bond analysis. The binding

566

probability was calculated from the number of force experiments displaying unbinding

567

events over the total number of force experiments.

568
569

The probability density function (PDF) of unbinding force was constructed from

570

unbinding events at the same pulling speed. For each unbinding force value, a

571

Gaussian unitary area was computed with its center representing the unbinding force

572

and the width (standard deviation) reflecting its measuring uncertainty (square root of

573

the variance of the noise in the force curve). All Gaussian areas from one experimental

574

setting were accordingly summed up and normalized with its binding activity to yield

High-speed AFM (hsAFM) and data analysis.

579

Purified SARS-CoV-2 trimeric Spike glycoproteins, murine Clec4g and CD209c and

580

hCLEC4g and hCD209 were diluted to 20 ¬µg/ml with imaging buffer (20mM HEPES,

581

1mM CaCl2, pH 7.4) and 1.5 ¬µl of the protein solution was applied onto freshly cleaved

582

mica discs with diameters of 1.5 mm. After 3 minutes, the surface was rinsed with

583

~15¬µL imaging buffer (without drying) and the sample was mounted into the imaging

584

chamber of the hsAFM (custom-built, RIBM, Japan). Movies were captured in imaging

585

buffer containing 3¬µg/ml of either Clec4g, CD209c, hCLEC4G or hCD209. An ultra-

586

short cantilever (USC-F1.2-k0.15 nominal spring constant 0.15 N/m, Nanoworld,

587

Switzerland) was used and areas of 100x100nm containing single molecules were

588

selected to capture the hsAFM movies at a scan rate of ~150-300 ms per frame.

589

During the acquisition of the movies, the amplitude was kept constant and set to 90-

590

85% of the free amplitude (typically ~3 nm). Data analysis was performed using the

591

Gwyddion 2.55 software. Images were processed to remove background and transient

592

noise. For volume measurements, a height threshold mask was applied over the

593

protein structures with a minimum height of 0.25 ‚Äì 0.35 nm to avoid excessive

594

background noise in the masked area. The numbers of lectin molecules bound to the

595

Spike trimers was calculated based on the measured mean volumes of the full-length

596

Spike, the lectins, and the Spike-lectin complexes, averaged over the recorded time-

597

periods.

AFM measured Spike binding to Vero E6 cells.

600

Vero E6 cells were grown on culture dishes using DMEM containing 10% FBS, 500

601

units/mL penicillin and 100 ¬µg/mL streptomycin, at 37¬∞C with 5% CO 2. For AFM

602

measurements, the cell density was adjusted to about 10-30% confluency. Before the

603

measurements, the growth medium was exchanged to a physiological HEPES buffer

604

containing 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM HEPES

605

(pH 7.4). Lectins were added at the indicated concentrations. Using a full-length Spike

606

trimer anchored to an AFM cantilever (described above), force-distance curves were

607

recorded at room temperature on living cells with the assistance of a CCD camera for

608

localization of the cantilever tip on selected cells. The sweep range was fixed at 3000

609

nm and the sweep rate was set at 1 Hz. For each cell, at least 100 force-distance

610

cycles with 2000 data points per cycle and a typical force limit of about 30 pN were

611

recorded.

612
613

Glycan array analyses.

614

The glycan microarrays were analyzed by Asparia Glycomics (San Sebastian, Spain)

615

and prepared as described previously (Brzezicka et al., 2015). Briefly, 50 ŒºM ligand

616

solutions (1.25 nL, 5 drops, 250 pL drop volume) in sodium phosphate buffer (300 mM,

617

0.005% Tween-20, pH=8.4) were spatially arrayed employing a robotic non-contact

618

piezoelectric spotter (SciFLEXARRAYER S11, Scienion) onto N-hydroxysuccinimide

619

(NHS) activated glass slides (Nexterion H, Schott AG). After printing, the slides were

620

placed in a 75 % humidity chamber for 18 hours at 25 oC. The remaining NHS groups

621

were quenched with 50 mM solution of ethanolamine in sodium borate buffer (50 mM,

622

pH=9.0) for 1h. The slides were washed with PBST (PBS/0.05% Tween-20), PBS and

623

water, then dried in a slide spinner and stored at -20oC until use.

625

Glycan microarrays were compartmentalized using Proplate¬Æ 8 wells microarray

626

gaskets, generating 7 independent subarrays per slide. Fusion proteins were diluted

627

at a final concentration (10 Œºg/mL) in binding buffer (25mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM

628

CaCl2 and 0.005% Tween 20 containing 0.5 % bovine serum albumin). Lectins were

629

applied to the microarrays and incubated at 4¬∫C overnight with gentle shaking. The

630

solutions were removed and arrays washed with binding buffer without BSA at room

631

temperature. Interactions were visualized by the incubation of tetramethylrhodamine

632

(TRITC) labelled secondary goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Fc specific; 1:1000

633

dilution in binding buffer ; Life Technologies) and goat anti-Human IgG (Fc specific)-

634

Cy3 (1:1000 dilution in binding buffer; Merck). Finally, slides were washed with binding

635

buffer without BSA, dried in a slide spinner and scanned. Fluorescence was analyzed

636

using an Agilent G265BA microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies). The

637

quantification of fluorescence was done using ProScanArray Express software (Perkin

638

Elmer) employing an adaptive circle quantification method from 50 Œºm (minimum spot

639

diameter) to 300 Œºm (maximum spot diameter). Average RFU (relative fluorescence

640

unit) values with local background subtraction of four spots and standard deviation of

641

the mean were recorded using Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism.

642
643

Structural modelling.

644

Structural models of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein were based on the model of the

645

fully glycosylated Spike-hACE2 complex. Experimental structures deposited in the

646

protein databank (PDB) were used to model the complex that is formed by the binding

647

of SARS-CoV-2 Spike and ACE2 (Walls et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020). RBD domain

648

in complex with ACE2 was superimposed with Spike with one open RBD domain

649

(PDB: 6VYB) and SWISS-MODEL was used to model missing residues in Spike

650

(Waterhouse et al., 2018) (GenBank QHD43416.1). Glycan structures in agreement

651

with the assignments of the current work were added using the methodology outlined

652

by Turupcu et al (Turupcu and Oostenbrink, 2017). The full model is available at the

653

MolSSI / BioExcel COVID-19 Molecular Structure and Therapeutics Hub

654

(https://covid.molssi.org//models/#spike-protein-in-complex-with-human-ace2-spike-

655

spike-binding). For hCLEC4G a homology model of residues 118 ‚Äì 293 was

656

constructed using Swiss-Model (Waterhouse et al., 2018) using residues 4 ‚Äì 180 of

657

chain A of the crystal structure of the carbohydrate recognition domain of DC-SIGNR

658

(CD299) (PDB-code 1sl6, (Guo et al., 2004)). This fragment shows a sequence identity

659

of 36% with hCLEC4G, and the resulting model showed an overall QMEAN value of -

660

2.68. For mClec4g, the model consisted of residues 118 ‚Äì 294, with a sequence

661

identity of 38 % to the same template model. The resulting QMEAN value was -2.88.

662

A calcium ion and the bound Lewis x oligosaccharide of the template were taken over

663

into the model, indicating the location of the carbohydrate binding site. For hCD209,

664

the crystal structure of the carbohydrate recognition domain of CD209 (DC-SIGN)

665

complexed with Man4 (PDB code 1sl4, (Guo et al., 2004)) was used. To identify

666

binding sites of hCLEC4G and hCD209 to the Spike-hACE2 complex, a superposition

667

of the bound carbohydrates with the glycans on Spike was performed. For hCLEC4G,

668

we used the complex glycans at N343 of the third monomer of Spike, with the receptor

669

binding domain in an ‚Äòup‚Äô position, while N343 glycans on monomer 1 and 2 were

670

modelled with the receptor binding domain in a ‚Äòdown‚Äô position. For hCD209 we used

671

the high-mannose glycan at position N234 in monomer 1-3 of Spike, respectively.

672

These glycan structures were chosen in accordance with the full-length Spike

673

glycoproteome.

SARS-CoV-2 infections.

676

Vero E6 cells were seeded in 48-well plates (5x104 cells per well) (Sarstedt, 83.3923)

677

in DMEM containing 10% FBS. 24 hours post-seeding, different concentrations of

678

lectins were mixed with 103 PFU of virus (1:1) to a final volume of 100Œºl per well in

679

DMEM (resulting in a final concentration of 5% FBS). After incubation for 30 min at

680

37¬∞C, Vero E6 were infected either with mixes containing lectins/SARS-CoV-2, SARS-

681

CoV-2 alone, or mock infected. 15 hours post-infection, supernatants were removed,

682

cells were washed 3 times with PBS and then lysed using Trizol Reagent (Thermo

683

Fisher Scientific, 15596026). The qRT-PCR for the detection of viral RNA was

684

performed as previously described (Monteil et al., 2020). Briefly, RNA was extracted

685

using the Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research, R2051). The qRT-PCR was

686

performed for the SARS-CoV-2 E gene and RNase P was used as an endogenous

687

gene control to normalize viral RNA levels to the cell number. Lectins were

688

independently tested for cellular toxicity in an ATP-dependent assay (Cell-Titer Glo,

689

Promega) and cells found to exhibit >80% viability up to a concentration of 200 Œºg/ml

(data not shown).
