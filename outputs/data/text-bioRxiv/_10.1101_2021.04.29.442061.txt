Abstract
Aging is a major risk factor of high incidence and increased mortality of acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19. We repot that aging impairs
the intrinsic FoxM1-dependent endothelial regeneration and vascular repair program
and causes persistent lung injury and high mortality following sepsis. Therapeutic
gene transduction of FOXM1 in vascular endothelium or treatment with FDAapproved drug Decitabine was sufficient to reactivate FoxM1-dependent lung
endothelial regeneration in aged mice, reverse aging-impaired resolution of
inflammatory injury, and promote survival. In COVID-19 lung autopsy samples,
FOXM1 expression was not induced in vascular endothelial cells of elderly patients in
contrast to mid-age patients. Thus, Decitabine reactivation of FoxM1-dependent
vascular repair represents a potential effective therapy for elderly COVID-19 and
non-COVID-19 ARDS patients.

INTRODUCTION
The global COVID-19 pandemic has signified the urgency and importance of
understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of endothelial regeneration and
vascular repair in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
ARDS is a form of acute-onset hypoxemic respiratory failure with bilateral
pulmonary infiltrates, which is caused by acute inflammatory edema of the lungs not
attributable to left heart failure (1-3). The common causes of ARDS include sepsis,
pneumonia, inhalation of harmful substance, burn, major trauma with shock and
massive transfusion. Sepsis with annual U.S. incidence of over 750,000 is the most
common cause. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 has also found to be
the major cause of ARDS. Endothelial injury characterized by persistently increased
lung microvascular permeability resulting in protein-rich lung edema is a hallmark of
acute lung injury (ALI)/ARDS (4-7). Despite recent advances on the understanding of
the pathogenesis, there are currently no effective pharmacological or cell-based
treatment of the disease and the mortality remains as high as 40% (1-3). Compared
to young adult patients, the incidence of ARDS resulting from sepsis and pneumonia
in elderly patients ( 65 yr) is as much as 19-fold greater and the mortality is up to 10fold greater (1, 8-11).

Similarly, the hospitalization and mortality rates of elderly

COVID-19 patients are much higher than young adults (12-15). In one study, it has
been shown that 43% of COVID-19 patients aged ≥ 70 years died compared to 8.7%
of 40-59 years old and 2.8% of 20-39 years old patients died (14). Severe vascular
endothelial injury derived from direct viral effects and perivascular inflammation is a

characteristic feature of COVID-19 lung injury (16-19) and COVID-19 ARDS is
considered as a vascular endotype of ARDS (20-22). However, little is known about
how aging influences mechanisms of endothelial regeneration and resulting
restoration of vascular homeostasis. The underlying causes of aging-related high
incidence and mortality of ARDS and COVID-19 are poorly understood and thus
there is no effective therapy to prevent and treat COVID-19 and non-COVID-19
ARDS.
Here we sought to define the cell source of origin mediating lung endothelial
regeneration following sepsis injury by genetic lineage tracing, determine how aging
affects this process and resolution of inflammatory lung injury, and delineate the
underlying molecular mechanisms. Our studies demonstrate that aging impairs the
intrinsic endothelial regeneration and vascular repair program and thus resolution of
inflammation. Forced expression of the forkhead transcription factor FoxM1 (23-26)
in lung ECs (transgenic or non-viral delivery of plasmid DNA) in aged mice is
sufficient to re-activate lung endothelial regeneration and vascular repair and promote
survival following sepsis. FoxM1 expression was induced in pulmonary vascular ECs
of mid-aged COVID-19 patients but not in elderly patients. Importantly, repurposing
an FDA-approved drug Decitabine could reactivate FoxM1-dependent endothelial
regeneration and promote survival in aged mice. Thus, our studies demonstrate
repurposing Decitabine to activate FoxM1-dependent endothelial regeneration and
vascular repair represents a potential novel and effective therapy of ARDS and severe
COVID-19 in elderly patients.

RESULTS
Aging impairs intrinsic lung endothelial regeneration following polymicrobial
sepsis-induced injury
The major pathogenic feature of ALI/ARDS leading to deterioration of vascular
barrier function is the precipitous loss of ECs (27-30). To trace the changes of
pulmonary ECs following sepsis challenge, we performed lineage tracing on
pulmonary ECs using a tamoxifen-inducible mTmG/EndoSCL-CreERT2 mouse (fig.
S1A). 95% of lung ECs (CD45-CD31+) were labeled with green fluorescent protein
(GFP) after tamoxifen treatment (fig. S1, B and C) whereas 5% of GFP+ cells were
either CD45+ cells (leukocytes) or CD31- cells (non-ECs) (fig. S1, D to G).
Fluorescence imaging revealed GFP+ ECs in capillaries and along the inner surfaces
of blood vessels but not bronchioles (Fig. 1A). In young adult mice (3-5 mos. old), at
48h post-cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), which causes lethal peritonitis and
polymicrobial sepsis, a well-recognized clinically relevant murine model of sepsis
(31, 32), the presence of GFP+ ECs was noticeably disrupted along the blood vessel
inner surfaces, consistent with loss of ECs seen in patients and animal models; by
144h post-CLP, the blood vessel inner wall was nicely lined with GFP+ ECs again
(fig. S2). To quantify the changes of pulmonary EC numbers over the course of
sepsis-induced injury and recovery, we measured the percentage of CD45-GFP+ cells
in the whole lung by flow cytometry analysis (FACS) in young adult mice. In sham
animals, 40% of pulmonary CD45- cells were GFP+. At 48h post-CLP, this number
had dropped to 25%, but was followed by a steady return to baseline levels by 144h

(Fig. 1, B and C). However, the CD45+GFP+ cell population was remained at steady
minimal levels at various times (fig. S3), indicating CD45+GFP+ cells were not
involved in endothelial regeneration. Bone marrow cell transplantation study further
demonstrated that bone marrow-derived cells were not attributable to endothelial
regeneration as the transplanted GFP+ population remained steady (fig. S4). Together,
these data demonstrate that lung resident ECs are the cell source for endothelial
regeneration in young adult mice following sepsis-induced injury.
FACS analysis revealed that the lung GFP+ EC population was markedly
decreased at 48h post-CLP in aged (19-21 mos.) mice as observed in young adult
mice (Fig. 1D). However, in contrast to young adult mice (Figure 1C), the GFP+ EC
population in aged mice failed to recover and remained low at 144h post-CLP (Fig.
1D). Thus, aging impaired the intrinsic endothelial regeneration program following
sepsis challenge.
Impaired endothelial regeneration leads to persistent inflammatory lung injury in
aged mice following polymicrobial sepsis
We next employed bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse assay to assess cell
proliferation. Anti-BrdU immunostaining revealed defective lung endothelial
proliferation in aged mice in contrast to young adult mice during the recovery phase
(e.g., 72 and 96h post-CLP) (Fig. 1, E and F). Accordingly, Evans blue-conjugated
albumin (EBA) assay, a measurement of vascular permeability to protein showed
persistent vascular leak indicating impaired vascular repair in the lungs of aged mice
whereas vascular permeability returned to basal levels at 96h post-CLP in young adult

mice (Fig. 1G). The aged lungs also exhibited marked edema measured by greater
lung wet/dry weight ratio at 72h post-CLP (Fig. 1H) and impaired resolution of
inflammation during the recovery phase evident by persistently elevated lung
myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (Fig. 1I), indicative of neutrophil sequestration, and
increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines in lung tissue (fig. S5).
Aging impairs lung vascular repair and resolution of inflammation following
endotoxemia
To determine if aged mice also exhibit impaired vascular repair following
endotoxemia, aged (19-21 mos.) and young (3-5 mos.) mice were challenged with
lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Given that aged mice exhibited greater lung injury
indicated by greater EBA flux and MPO activity at 24h post-LPS compared to young
adult mice in response to the same dose of LPS (data not shown), we challenged the
aged mice with a lower dose of LPS (e.g., 1.0 mg/kg) to induce a similar degree of
injury during the injury phase (e.g., 24h) as seen in young adult mice with 2.5 mg/kg
of LPS (Fig. 2A). EBA flux in young adult mice was reduced at 48h and returned to
basal levels at 72h post-LPS whereas it remained elevated in aged lungs
demonstrating defective vascular repair in aged lungs (Fig. 2A). Consistently, aged
lungs exhibited edema at 72h post-LPS, which was not observed in young adult mice
(Fig. 2B). MPO activity remained elevated in aged lungs at 72h post-LPS (Fig. 2C).
Furthermore, quantitative RT-PCR analysis demonstrated markedly elevated
expression of proinflammatory genes including Tnf and Il6 in lungs of aged but not
young adult mice at 72h post-LPS (fig. S6). Together, these data demonstrated

impaired vascular repair and resolution of inflammation in aged lungs following LPS
challenge.
To further determine how aging affects vascular repair and inflammation
resolution, we challenged the mice at various ages (3 to 21 mos. old) with LPS and
assessed EBA flux and MPO activity at 72h post-LPS. As shown in Fig. 2D, EBA
flux in mice at age of 6 mos. or younger returned to basal levels whereas it did not
fully recover and maintained at marginally increased levels in 9 and 12 mos. old mice.
EBA flux was markedly elevated in 15 mos. old mice and greatly exaggerated in aged
mice (18 and 21 mos. old). We also observed similar changes in MPO activity. Lung
MPO activity did not return to basal levels at 72h post-LPS in mice starting at age 12
mos. and remained markedly increased in lungs of mice at age 15 mos. or older,
indicating impaired resolution of inflammation (Fig. 2E). Thus, mice at age 18 mos.
or older exhibited severely impaired vascular repair and resolution of inflammation.
Defective endothelial proliferation and inhibited FoxM1 induction in aged lungs
following LPS challenge
Anti-BrdU immunostaining shows a marked increase of endothelial proliferation
in the lungs of young adult mice at 72h post-LPS whereas endothelial proliferation in
lungs of aged mice was largely inhibited (Fig. 2F), indicating impaired endothelial
regeneration in aged lungs following LPS challenge. As FoxM1 is a critical reparative
transcriptional factor (27, 33, 34), we assessed FoxM1 expression in mouse lungs.
Foxm1 was markedly induced in the lungs of young adult mice during the recovery
phase but not in aged lungs following LPS challenge (Fig. 2G). Accordingly, Foxm1

target genes essential for cell cycle progression were not induced in aged lungs (fig.
S7).
Normalized vascular repair and inflammation resolution in aged Foxm1Tg mice
To determine if failure of FoxM1 induction is responsible for the impaired
vascular repair and inflammation resolution in aged mice, we employed the Foxm1Tg
mice expressing human FOXM1 under the control of Rosa26 promoter (35). EBA flux
was increased similarly at 24h post-LPS challenge in aged Foxm1Tg mice compared to
aged WT mice, demonstrating similar degree of lung vascular injury (Fig. 3A). EBA
flux was then reduced at 48h and returned to a level close to basal level at 72h postLPS in aged Foxm1Tg mice whereas it was persistently elevated in aged WT mice
(Fig. 3A). MPO activity was also similarly increased during the injury phase in aged
WT and Foxm1Tg mice and returned to basal levels at 72h post-LPS in aged Foxm1Tg
mice but not in aged WT mice (Fig. 3B). These data demonstrate normalized vascular
repair and resolution of inflammation in aged Foxm1Tg mice following LPS challenge.
Accordingly, transgenic expression of FoxM1 promoted survival. 70% of aged
Foxm1Tg mice survived in 7 days following LPS challenge whereas all the aged WT
mice died (Fig. 3C).
Restored endothelial regeneration and resolution of inflammatory lung injury in
aged WT mice by FoxM1 gene transduction
Next, we employed a gene therapy approach to determine if forced FoxM1
expression in lung vascular ECs of aged WT mice after sepsis can reactivate
endothelial regeneration and thus restore the defective resolution of inflammatory

lung injury. A mixture of liposome:plasmid DNA (36) expressing human FOXM1
under the control of human CDH5 promoter (EC-specific) or empty vector DNA was
administered retro-orbitally to 19-20 mos. old WT mice at 12h post-LPS (established
lung injury). At 72h post-LPS, liposome transduction of FOXM1 plasmid DNA
resulted in a marked increase of FoxM1 expression in aged WT mice compared to
vector DNA-transduced mice (Fig. 3D). EBA flux was drastically decreased (Fig. 3E)
and lung MPO activity returned to a level close to basal level (Fig. 3F) in FOXM1
plasmid DNA-transduced mice in contrast to vector DNA-transduced mice.
We also assessed whether the restored vascular repair and resolution of
inflammation is attributable to reactivated endothelial proliferation (i.e. regeneration)
in aged lungs. BrdU labeling study revealed a marked increase of EC proliferation in
lungs of FOXM1 plasmid DNA-transduced mice in sharp contrast to vector DNAtransduced mice (Fig. 3, G and H). Expression of FoxM1 target genes essential for
cell cycle progression including Cdc25c, Ccna2, and Ccnb1 was also markedly
induced in lungs of FOXM1 plasmid DNA-transduced mice (Fig. 3I).
To further determine if forced expression of FoxM1 in mice at very old age
(e.g., 25 mos. old, equivalent to human age of ≥80 years) could still reactivate the
vascular repair program, we employed our newly developed poly(lactide-coglycolide)-b-poly(ethylene glycol) copolymer (PLGA-PEG)-based nanoparticles to
deliver the FOXM1 plasmid DNA. The mixture of nanoparticle:plasmid DNA was
administrated retro-orbitally to 25 mos. old mice at 24h post-LPS (established injury).
At 96h post-LPS, lungs were collected for EBA and MPO assays. As shown in Fig.

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.29.442061; this version posted April 30, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

3J, lung vascular permeability measured in vector DNA-transduced mice at 96h postLPS remained markedly elevated whereas it was greatly reduced in FOXM1 plasmid
DNA-transduced mice comparable to the observation in 19-21 mos. old mice (Fig.
3E). Similarly, lung MPO activity in FOXM1 plasmid DNA-transduced mice was also
markedly reduced (Fig. 3K), indicating normalized resolution of inflammation.
Failure of FoxM1 Induction in pulmonary vascular ECs of elderly COVID-19
patients
To validate the potential clinical relevance of our findings in aged mice, we
collected lung autopsy samples from COVID-19 patients (Table S1) and carried out
RNAscope in situ hybridization assay to determine FOXM1 expression. FOXM1
expression in pulmonary vascular ECs was markedly induced in middle-aged
COVID-19 patients but not in elderly patients (Fig. 4). Anti-CD31 immunostaining
shows extensive disruption of the endothelial monolayer of COVID-19 patients in
both middle-aged and elderly patients (Fig. 4A), manifesting the characteristic feature
of endothelial injury of severe COVID-19 patients (16-19).
Therapeutic activation of FoxM1-dependent endothelial regeneration and
vascular repair in aged lungs
We next explored the possibility of pharmacological activation of FoxM1dependent endothelial regeneration in aged lungs which will have great translational
potential for treatment of ARDS and severe COVID-19 in elderly patients. Given the
important role of epigenetics in aging, we focused on DNA methyl transferase
inhibitor (e.g., 5-Aza 2’-deoxycytidine) and histone deacetylase inhibitor

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.29.442061; this version posted April 30, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

(Trichostatin A). In a preliminary study, we observed that 5-Aza 2’-deoxycytidine
(i.e. Decitabine) but not Trichostatin A treatment could normalize vascular repair in
aged mice following LPS challenge (data not shown). Thus, we chose to address the
potential of the FDA-approved drug Decitabine. At 24h and 48h post-LPS, aged (2122 mos. old) mice were treated with Decitabine or vehicle (PBS) and lung tissues
were collected at 96h post-LPS for analyses. As shown in Fig. 5A, FoxM1 expression
was markedly induced in lungs of Decitabine-treated mice. EBA assay demonstrated
normalized vascular repair in Decitabine-treated mice in contrast to vehicle-treated
mice (Fig. 5B). Lung MPO activity of Decitabine-treated mice was also returned to
basal levels (Fig. 5C). However, Decitabine treatment didn’t promote vascular repair
and inflammation resolution in young adult mice (fig. S8). Also early Decitabine
treatment (e.g. at 2h post-LPS) didn’t have detrimental effects on LPS-induced lung
injury (fig. S9), indicating a big safe window (any time after injury) for administering
Decitabine to patients.
BrdU immunostaining revealed that pulmonary vascular EC proliferation was
drastically increased in Decitabine-treated aged mice, indicating reactivation of
endothelial regeneration (Fig. 5, D and E). Accordingly, expression of FoxM1 target
genes essential for cell cycle progression were markedly induced in lungs of
Decitabine-treated aged mice (Fig. 5F). Decitabine treatment also markedly improved
survival of aged WT mice. 80% of Decitabine-treated mice survived whereas only
20% of vehicle-treated WT mice survived at the same period (Fig. 5G). To determine
if the survival effect was mediated by Decitabine-activated FoxM1 expression in ECs,

we employed the mice with EC-specific knockout of Foxm1 (Foxm1EC) (27). As
shown in Fig. 5G. Decitabine treatment had no protective effects on the survival of
aged Foxm1EC mice following LPS challenge.

DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrates that in young adult mice, lung resident ECs
mediate endothelial regeneration responsible for vascular repair and resulting
inflammation resolution following polymicrobial sepsis-induced injury. However,
aging impairs these processes leading to persistent inflammatory lung injury and high
mortality in aged mice. Mechanistically, aging inhibits FoxM1-dependent endothelial
regeneration and forced expression of FoxM1 by transgene or transient plasmid DNA
transduction normalizes vascular repair and resolution of inflammation and promotes
survival in aged mice. We also observed marked induction of FOXM1 expression in
pulmonary vascular ECs of middle-aged COVID19 patients but not in elderly
patients. Importantly, treatment of Decitabine activated FoxM1-dependent endothelial
regeneration leading to normalized vascular repair and resolution of inflammation and
enhanced survival in aged mice following sepsis. Thus, therapeutic activation of
FoxM1 expression, e.g., by repurposing Decitabine may represent an effective
approach for the prevention and treatment of ARDS and severe COVID-19 in elderly
patients.
Studies have demonstrated that endothelial barrier dysfunction is the major
contributor to lung injury and poor prognostic outcomes of sepsis, ARDS (4, 5, 3741), and severe COVID19 (16-19). Severe inflammation such as following sepsis
induces pulmonary vascular EC loss and disrupts endothelial barrier. Employing
genetic lineage tracing and FACS analysis, we demonstrate that resident EC is the
origin of source for lung endothelial regeneration. Our bone marrow transplantation

study further excluded the contribution of bone marrow-derived cells in this
regenerative process. Together, these studies provide unequivocal evidence of the
exclusive contribution of lung resident ECs to endothelial regeneration in a clinically
relevant sepsis model, CLP-induced polymicrobial sepsis. Employing this genetic
lineage tracing mouse model, our studies have demonstrated impaired endothelial
regeneration in aged lungs in contrast to young adult mice. We observed defective
endothelial proliferation and vascular repair in aged lungs following lung injury
induced by both polymicrobial sepsis and endotoxemia, which resulted in persistent
lung vascular leaking and inflammation and thus high mortality. The impaired
recovery of aged lungs following sepsis challenge is not attributable to more severe
injury in aged mice than young adult mice as we employed different doses of LPS to
induce similar degree of lung injury during the injury phase. We also found that mice
starting at age of 12 mos. exhibited defective vascular repair and inflammation
resolution which had becoming more severe with aging. These data could explain the
clinical observations that the incidence and mortality of ARDS resulting from sepsis,
pneumonia, and COVID-19 in elderly patients was much higher than young adult
patients (8-15).
ECs are normally quiescent with a very low turnover rate. In response to
injury, expression of some transcriptional factors is induced to activate EC
proliferation (42). We have shown previously that FoxM1 is markedly induced in
lung ECs in the recovery phase but not in the injury phase in young adult mice
following LPS challenge (27). Here we show that FoxM1 was not induced in aged

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.29.442061; this version posted April 30, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

lungs following sepsis challenge, which played a causal role in aging-impaired
endothelial regeneration and resolution of inflammatory injury as transgenic
expression of FoxM1 prevented the defective phenotype in aged FOXM1Tg mice and
promoted survival following LPS challenge. As FoxM1 was expressed ubiquitously in
all cells in the FOXM1Tg mice by the Rosa26 promoter, it is unknown if the beneficial
effects were mediated by FoxM1-dependent endothelial regeneration in aged lungs.
Genetic compensation of FoxM1 overexpression in FOXM1Tg mice may also
contribute to the normalized vascular repair in aged mice. Thus, we designed a gene
therapy-like approach to determine if transient expression of FoxM1 in ECs delivered
after vascular injury could reactivate the intrinsic endothelial regeneration and
vascular repair program in aged WT mice. To our surprise, transient expression of a
single transcription factor in aged lungs could reactivate the intrinsic endothelial
regeneration program and normalize the resolution of inflammatory lung injury in
aged WT mice, even in mice at age of 25 mos., which is equivalent to human age of
80 years or older (43).

As the plasmid DNA was transduced at 12 or 24h post-LPS

challenge with established injury, this study provides unequivocal evidence of the
necessary and sufficient role of restored FoxM1 expression in reactivating vascular
repair and inflammation resolution in aged lungs.
Although FOXM1 expression was markedly induced in pulmonary vascular
ECs of middle-aged COVID-19 patients, it was not induced in elderly COVID-19
patients. These data demonstrate the clinical relevance of our observations in aged
mice. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, FoxM1 expression is also

markedly induced in the lungs of young adult mice at 7 days after infection (44).
Together, these studies provide strong evidence of the clinical importance of FoxM1dependent endothelial regeneration in repairing the injured vasculature and promoting
recovery and survival from severe COVID-19. Thus, identification of therapeutic
agents to reactivate the aging-impaired FoxM1-dependent endothelial regeneration
has great translational potential.
Our study shows that the FDA-approved drug Decitabine which is used to
treat myelodysplastic syndrome can be repurposed for the prevention and treatment of
ARDS and severe COVID-19 in elderly patients. Decitabine treatment of aged mice
with established injury (24h post-LPS) could reactivate FoxM1 expression and
endothelial proliferation in aged lungs and thus promote vascular repair and survival.
Furthermore, the survival effect is mediated by endothelial FoxM1 expression as
Decitabine has no survival effect on aged Foxm1EC mice. However, Decitabine
treatment has no effects on vascular repair in young adult mice. Our unpublished
study also revealed that Decitabine had no protective effects on inflammatory lung
injury during the injury phase (at 24h) following LPS challenge in young adult mice.
Consistently, published studies have also shown that 5’-Aza 2’-deoxycytidine (the
chemical agent of Decitabine) alone has no protective effects on LPS-induced lung
vascular injury although a combination of 5’-Aza 2’-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A
can inhibit LPS-induced lung vascular injury and promote survival in young adult
mice, which are not ascribed to augmented vascular repair (45, 46). To the best of our
knowledge, our data for the first time provide unequivocal evidence to support the

role of Decitabine in reactivating the aging-impaired FoxM1-dependent endothelial
regeneration program for vascular repair and inflammation resolution in aged mice.
Intriguingly, Decitabine is under a clinical trial to test its safety and efficacy in
treating severe COVID-19 patients (NCT04482621). Based on our studies, the
Decitabine dose should be further optimized and the patient population should be
focused on elderly patients.
In summary, we have shown aging impairs the resolution of inflammatory lung
injury following sepsis challenge through inhibition of FoxM1-dependent endothelial
regeneration and vascular repair. Therapeutic activation of FoxM1 in ECs could
reactivate the intrinsic endothelial regeneration program for normalized resolution of
inflammatory injury in aged lungs. Thus, activation of endothelial FoxM1 expression
by repurposing Decitabine or nanoparticle delivery of FOXM1 plasmid DNA is a
potentially effective therapeutic strategy to restore the endothelial barrier integrity and

Materials and Methods
Mice. EndoSCL-CreERT2/mTmG lineage tracing mice were generated by breeding the mice
carrying a double-fluorescent reporter expressing membrane-targeted tandem dimer Tomato
(mT) prior to Cre-mediated excision and membrane-targeted green fluorescent protein (mG)
after excision (mTmG mice, #007676, the Jackson Laboratory) with EndoSCL-CreERT2
transgenic mice (C57BL/6 background) containing tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ERT2 driven by the
5’ endothelial enhancer of the stem cell leukemia locus (47, 48). Foxm1 transgenic (Foxm1Tg)
mice driven by the Rosa26 promoter were described previously (35). Foxm1EC mice with
Tie2Cre-mediated disruption of Foxm1 was described previously (27). Both male and female
mice were used in the experiments. Mice at various ages (3-5 mos. old referred as young adult;
19-25 mos. old referred as aged) were used. The experiments were conducted according to NIH
guidelines on the use of laboratory animals. The animal care and study protocols were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Northwestern University and The
University of Illinois at Chicago.
Human specimens. All experiments with human tissue samples were performed under protocols
approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the University of Chicago and Ann & Robert H.
Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago. Postmortem lung samples were collected from diseased
COVID19 patients. Control lung tissues from unused healthy donors were provided by Pulmonary
Hypertension Breakthrough Initiative (PHBI) (49).
Induction of lung injury. Polymicrobial sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture
(CLP) using a 23-gauge needle (50). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with inhaled isofluorane
(2.5% mixed with oxygen). When the mice failed to respond to paw pinch, buprenex (0.1 mg/kg)
was administered subcutaneously prior to sterilization of the skin with povidone iodine, then a
2

midline abdominal incision was made. The cecum was exposed and ligated with a 4-0 silk tie
placed 0.6 cm from the cecum tip, and the cecal wall was perforated with a 23-gauge needle.
Control mice (sham) underwent anesthesia, laparotomy, and wound closure, but no cecal ligation
or puncture. Following the procedure, 500 µl of prewarmed normal saline was administered
subcutaneously. Within 5 min following surgery, the mice woke from anesthesia. The recovered
mice subcutaneously received a second dose of buprenex at 8h post-surgery.
To induce endotoxemia, mice received a single dose of LPS (Escherichia coli 055:B5,
Santa Cruz, St. Dallas, TX) by i.p. injection. The LPS dose was dependent on the age of the mice
(3-9 mos. old, 2.5 mg/kg; 19-20 mos. old, 1.0 mg/kg; 21-22 mos. 0.5 mg/kg, 25 mos. old, 0.25
mg/kg). All mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (100/5 mg/kg BW, i.p.) prior to
tissue collection. For the survival study, mice were treated with a single dose of LPS and
monitored for 4-7 days.
Bone marrow transplantation. Lethal irradiation was peformed with a 6MV photon beam from a
linear accelerator (27). C57BL/6 WT mice (2 mos. old) were delivered a total of 1000 cGy at a
dose rate of 100 cGy/min. At 3h following irradiation, the mice were transplanted with 10
million of bone marrow cells (200 l of EBM2 medium) freshly isolated from EndoSCL-CreERT2
transgenic mice (2 mos. old) through tail vein injection. Five weeks post-transplantation, the
chimeric mice were treated with tamoxifen to induce Cre-mediated GFP lableling. Three weeks
later, the mice were challenged with CLP for assessment of bone marrow-derived GFP+ cells in
lung endothelial regeneration.
Vascular permeability assessment. The Evans blue dye-conjugated albumin (EBA)
extravasation assay was performed as previously described (50). Briefly, mice were retro-

3

orbitally injected with EBA at a dose of 20 mg/kg BW at 30 minutes prior to tissue collection.
Lungs were perfused free of blood with PBS, blotted dry and weighed. Lung tissues were then
homogenized in 1 ml PBS and incubated with 2 volumes of formamide at 60C for 18 hours. The
homogenates were centrifuged at 10, 000  g for 30 minutes and the optical density of the
supernatant was determined at 620 nm and 740 nm. The extravasated EBA in lung homogenate
was presented as g of Evans blue dye per g lung tissue.
Myeloperoxidase assay. Following perfusion free of blood, lung tissues were collected and
homogenized in 50 mmol/L phosphate buffer. Homogenates were then centrifuged at 15, 000  g
for 20 minutes at 4C. The pellets were resuspended in phosphate buffer containing 0.5%
hexadecyl trimethylammonium bromide and subjected to a cycle of freezing and thawing.
Subsequently, the pellets were homogenized and the homogenates were centrifuged again.
Absorbance was measured at 460 nm every 15secs for 3 minutes and data expressed as
OD460/min/g lung tissue (27, 50).
FACS analysis. After perfusion free of blood with PBS, lung tissues were cut into small pieces,
and incubated with 1 mg/ml collagenase A for 1 h at 37oC in a shaking water bath (200rpm).
After digestion, the tissue was dispersed to a single cell preparation using the gentleMACSTM
Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) with the lung program 2. The cells were then filtered
using a 40 µm Nylon cell strainer and blocked with 20% FBS for 30 min. After incubation with
Fc blocker (1 µg/106 cells, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), the cells were immunostained with
anti-CD45-PB (1:800, BioLegend. San Diego, CA) and/or anti-CD31-APC (1:600, BD
Biosciences) for 45 min at room temperature. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry
(Fortessa, BD Biosciences) and sorted by flow-assisted cell sorting (Moflo Asrtios machine,

4

Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). mGFP- or tdTomato-labelled cells were directly analyzed with
488nm or 561nm laser wavelengths, respectively.
Cell proliferation. At 6 h prior to tissue collection, BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) was
injected i.p. into mice at 100 mg/kg BW. Mouse lung cryosections were stained overnight with
anti-BrdU (1:3, BD Biosciences, or 1:1000 Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) and
incubated with Alexa Fluo 488-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200, Thermal Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA). Lung vascular ECs were immunostained with anti-vWF (1:300, Sigma-Aldrich,
St Louis, MO) and anti-CD31 (1:100, BD Bioscience) antibodies at 4C. The sections were then
incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:200, Thermal Fisher
Scientific). The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Thermal Fisher Scientific). Three
consecutive cryosections from each mouse lung were examined, the average number of BrdU+
nuclei was used.
Molecular analysis. Total RNA was isolated using a RNeasy Mini kit including DNase I
digestion (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Following reverse transcription, quantitative RT-PCR analysis
was performed using a sequence detection system (ABI ViiA 7 system; Thermal Fisher
Scientific). The following primers sets were used for analysis: mouse FoxM1 primers, 5ʹCACTTGGATTGAGGACCACTT-3ʹ and 5ʹ-GTCGTTTCTGCTGTGATTCC-3ʹ; mouse
cyclophilin primers, 5ʹ-CTTGTCCATGGCAAATGCTG-3ʹ and 5ʹTGATCTTCTTGCTGGTCTTGC-3ʹ. Primers for mouse Cdc25c, Ccna2, Ccnb1, Tnf, Il6, and
Nos2 were purchased from Qiagen. The mouse gene expression was normalized to cyclophilin.

5

Western blot analysis was performed using an anti-FoxM1 antibody (1:800, sc-376471,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and the same blot was incubated with anti-β-actin
antibody (1:3000, BD Biosciences) as a loading control.
RNAscope in situ hybridization assay and immunostaining: To determine FOXM1 mRNA
expression in ECs of COVID-19 patient lungs and control normal donor lungs, a single-plex
RNAscope in situ hybridization assay (ACD, Bio-techne, Newark, CA) combined with
immunofluorescent staining for CD31 as a EC marker was carried out. Briefly, the tissue
sections were baked for 1 h at 60°C, deparaffinized, and treated with H2O2 for 10 min at room
temperature. Target retrieval was performed for 15 min at 100°C, followed by protease treatment
for 15 min at 40°C. The sections were then hybridized with human FOXM1 probe (Cat #
446941, target region 308-1244 in NM_001243088.1, ACD, Bio-techne) for 2 h at 40°C
followed by signal amplification for 30 minutes using RNAscope® Multiplex Fluorescent v2
Assay (Cat # 333110, ACD, Bio-techne) as per manufacturer’s instructions. The signal was
developed by incubating the slides with TSA plus Cyanine 5 system (PerkinElmer, Waltham,
MA) for 30 minutes. After RNAscope assay, the slides were incubated in blocking buffer (3%
BSA, 1% FBS and 0.1% normal donkey serum) for 1 h followed by with a primary antibody
against CD31 (Cat # Ab28364, Abcam, Cambridge, MA) at 4°C overnight. The sections were
washed and incubated with appropriate anti-rabbit secondary antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor
488 for 1 h. The slides were then counterstained with DAPI and mounted in Prolong Gold
Antifade mounting medium (ThermoFisher Scientific).
To quantify FOXM1 expression, a score system of 0-5 was used. 5 represented highest
while 1 lowest expression in vascular ECs of each vessel. Fifteen 63X fields each section were
randomly selected and examined.
6

Imaging. Following immunostaining, lung sections were imaged with a confocal microscope
system (LSM880; Carl Zeiss, Inc) equipped with a 63 × 1.2 NA objective lens. For lineage
tracing studies, the cryosections were directly mounted with Prolong Gold mounting media
containing DAPI.
Transduction of plasmid DNA into vascular endothelial cells in mice. To make liposomes, a
mixture comprised of dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide and cholesterol (1:1 molar ratio)
was dried using a Rotavaporator (Brinkmann), and dissolved in 5% glucose followed by 20 min
sonication as described previously (36, 50). The complex consisting of plasmid DNA expressing
human FOXM1 under the control of human CDH5 promoter or empty vector and liposomes was
combined at a ratio of 1 µg of DNA to 8 nmol of liposomes. The DNA/liposome complex (50 µg
of DNA/mouse) was injected into the retro-orbital venous plexus at 12h post-LPS challenge.
In a separate study, mixture of nanoparticle:plasmid DNA (15 µg DNA/mouse) was
administered retro-orbitally to mice of 25 mos. old at 24h post-LPS. The novel nanoparticle
(patent pending) was poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)-based with highly efficient gene
delivery to vascular ECs after retro-orbital administration.
Statistical analysis. Data distribution normality was first assessed by Shapiro-Wilk test.
Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA with a Dunnett post hoc analysis
that calculates P values corrected for multiple comparisons for equal variance or Kruskal-Wallis
test for unequal variance using Prism 7 (Graphpad Software, Inc. La Jolla, CA). Two-group
comparisons were analyzed by the unpaired 2-tailed t test for equal variance or by MannWhitney test for unequal variance. Statistical analysis of the survival study was performed with

7

the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. P < 0.05 denoted the presence of a statistically significant
difference. All bars in dot plot figures represent means.
