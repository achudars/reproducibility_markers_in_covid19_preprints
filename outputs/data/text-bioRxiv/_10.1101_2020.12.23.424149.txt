Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. The dimeric form of the viral main
protease is responsible for the cleavage of the viral polyprotein in 11 sites, including its own N
and C-terminus. Although several mechanisms of self-cleavage had been proposed for SARSCoV, the lack of structural information for each step is a setback to the understanding of this
process. Herein, we used X-ray crystallography to characterize an immature form of the main
protease, which revealed major conformational changes in the positioning of domain-three over
the active site, hampering the dimerization and diminishing its activity. We propose that this form
preludes the cis-cleavage of N-terminal residues within the dimer, leading to the mature active site.
Using fragment screening, we probe new cavities in this form which can be used to guide
therapeutic development. Furthermore, we characterized a serine site-directed mutant of the main
protease bound to its endogenous N and C-terminal residues during the formation of the tetramer.
This quaternary form is also present in solution, suggesting a transitional state during the Cterminal trans-cleavage. This data sheds light in the structural modifications of the SARS-CoV-2
main protease during maturation, which can guide the development of new inhibitors targeting its
intermediary states.

Main Text: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the

sequence similarity with SARS-CoV 4. The replicase gene (ORF1ab) encodes two overlapping
polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) that are required for viral replication and transcription 5.
The main protease (Mpro), also known as 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is a viral cysteine
protease specific for glutamine at the S1 subsite, showing variable recognition preferences at S2
(Leu/Phe/Met/Val) and S2’ subsites (Ser/Ala/Gly/Asn) 6. Mpro is responsible for the maturation of
pp1a and pp1ab in at least 11 characterized sites, including its auto-processing at the N and C
terminus, which is essential for its activity and dimerization 7–9. Due to its essential role in viral
replication, Mpro is one of the most well characterized non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. In
addition, its unique features of cleavage site recognition and the absence of closely related
homologues in humans, identify Mpro as a major target for antiviral drug development 9–11.
Although Mpro activity is crucial to viral biology, its self-maturation process is still poorly
understood. Several biochemical and crystallographic studies on native and mutated forms of
SARS-CoV Mpro tried to elucidate its maturation mechanism (reviewed in 12), by evaluating if the
N and C-terminus processing occurs within a dimer (cis-cleavage) or between two distinct dimers
(trans-cleavage). The first 2005 model suggested that Mpro probably forms a small amount of
active dimer after autocleavage that immediately enables the catalytic site to act on other cleavage
sites in the polyprotein 13. In 2010, based on the observation that dimerization of mature M pro is
enhanced by the presence of substrates, Li and colleagues proposed that after the translation, two
Mpro protomers form a transient dimer which is stabilized by binding the N-terminal site of its
substrate (another Mpro in polyprotein) and further cleave to free its N-terminus 14. In addition,
Chen et al. (2010) suggested that the N-terminal autocleavage might only need two immature
forms of Mpro in monomeric polyproteins to form an intermediate dimer that is not related to the
active dimer of the mature enzyme 15.
Herein, we used X-ray crystallography integrated with biochemical techniques to
investigate the self-maturation process of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The construct of Mpro containing Nterminal insertions produced an immature form of the enzyme (IMT Mpro), unable to form a dimer,
that showed a reduced enzymatic activity. We used fragment screening to probe new cavities for
drug development in this construct. The inactive mutant C145S with inserted native N-terminal
residues (C145S Mpro) produced a form of the protein that behaves as monomers, dimers, trimers
and tetramers in solution. Crystals of the tetrameric form revealed details of how M pro selfprocesses its N and C-terminal residues. All forms of the enzyme revealed important conformation
changes that can guide direct-acting drug development.
Activity and biochemical characterization
A general strategy to produce SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is to maintain its self-cleavage N-terminal
portion and add the HRV-3C cleavage site with a histidine-tag at the C-terminal portion. We
successfully used ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by ion exchange chromatography to
obtain pure Mpro, simplifying the protocol to one that takes less than 8 h and with a final yield of
~2.5 mg/L of culture. The SARS-CoV-2 IMT Mpro was obtained by adding a non-cleavable
sequence (Gly-Ala-Met) at the N-terminal Ser1 of Mpro, and purified by a similar protocol. The
SARS-CoV-2 IMT Mpro was produced as a soluble protein, yielding ~80 mg/L of culture. To
further investigate the role of N-terminal residues in the maturation of Mpro, we designed a
construct containing the mutated C145S residue with its native cleavage peptide of Mpro (Ser4,Ala-3,Val-2,Leu-1,Gln0↓) at the N-terminal of Ser1 (Fig. S1). During gel filtration, two Mpro
peaks were identified with mass consistent with a monomer and a tetramer (Fig. S1).

Mpro and IMT Mpro demonstrate to be active and able to recognize and cleave the fluorogenic
substrate (Fig. 1), with Km values of 16.4 ± 2.3 μM and 34.3 ± 2.2 μM, respectively. IMT Mpro
exhibited only 6% of the catalytic efficiency compared with mature Mpro. As previously reported,
the Mpro N-terminal is fundamental for dimerization and any additional residues would reduce or
even abolish its activity 9,16–18. As expected, C145S Mpro has only shown residual activity (Fig. 1).
All three Mpro constructs exhibited similar thermal-stability profiles, indicating similar folding
(Fig. 1).
Analysis in solution using SEC-MALS suggests that Mpro behaves as a dimer in the tested
conditions, as expected 11. For IMT Mpro, the additional residues at N-terminal seem to prevent
dimerization completely. For C145S Mpro, however, the additional residues allow the protein to
adopt multiple conformational states ranging from monomers to tetramers (Fig. 1).
Despite the site-direct mutagenesis of the C145S Mpro, the enzyme exhibited residual
proteolytic activity which allowed us to observe self-processing by SDS-PAGE in the course of
two days. Despite the efficiency of Mpro, its addition to the reaction does not seem to enhance
significantly the rate of self-cleavage, suggesting cis-cleavage as main mechanism of N-terminal
cleavage (Fig. 1).
Crystal structure of Mpro
Mpro was crystallized in several conditions and its X-ray structure was determined at 1.46
Å in C21 space group. All 306 residues were refined at the electron density to a final Rwork/Rfree of
0.16/0.18, with 99% of Ramachandran in favored positions (Table S2). The crystal asymmetric
unit contains one monomer which could be symmetry expanded to the biological dimer, following
the same pattern of the majority of known structures deposited in PDB (r.m.s.d of 0.2 Å vs PDB
5RGG, for all Cα 306). The Mpro protomers are formed by three domains (DI, DII and DIII), with
its catalytic region located at the double-barreled DII 9 (Fig. S2).
Crystal structure of IMT Mpro
The crystal structure of IMT Mpro at 1.6 Å was determined using 3 merged datasets (Fig
S3, S4, Table S1) in P212121 space group, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit, packed in
similar shape to the known biological unit of Mpro. The structure was refined to a final Rwork/Rfree
of 0.20/0.22, with 97% of Ramachandran in favored positions (Table S2). In the recent published
structures of GM-Mpro, both apo and ligand-complexes exhibited minor differences with the
mature form 16. However, in our structure there are distinguishable differences in the overall
structure, especially in the position of DIII helices (Fig. 2). Although IMT Mpro asymmetric unit
resembles the biological dimer form of native protein, PISA 19 analysis indicate that the dimer
packing is unstable in solution, with an interface area of 1,256 Å2 (vs 1,557 Å of Mpro), calculated
free energy ΔG of -13.4 kcal/mol (vs -14.9 kcal/mol of Mpro) for 26 potential hydrogen bonds (vs
49 of Mpro) and 5 potential salt bridges (vs 10 of Mpro).
While IMT Mpro DI and DII are less affected by the N-terminal insertion (r.m.s.d of 0.34
Å vs Mpromat for Cα of 1-184), DIII appears to adopt a more open conformation relative to M pro
(r.m.s.d of 1.33 Å for Cα of 201-301) (Fig. 2), with the interfacing residues Ala285 at a distance
of 10 Å in the IMT Mpro (vs 5.2 Å in Mpro) (Fig. S5). This conformation is more accentuated at
chain A where the electron density of the N-terminal insertion is clearly visible in the model. For
this chain, the N-terminal insertion pushes chain A helices αF and αH further of chain B active
site, opening a cleft for Phe140 rises to the surface of the molecule, leading to major conformation
alterations of the chain B active site souring residues, such as Glu166, Pro168 and Gln189 (Fig. 2

and S6). The plasticity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site was already reported when apo X-ray
structures collected at cryo and room temperatures were compared 20, and its expected given the
broad spectrum of endogenous substrates that Mpro is expected to process. However, the IMT Mpro
revealed major structural alterations in the oxyanion hole, likely affecting enzyme processing.
Despite the significant changes of the active site, relative position of the catalytic dyad Cys145His41 remains unchanged in this form (Fig. 2).
Fragment Screening of Mpro immature
Recently, a small-fragment library of more than 1,250 unique fragments were screened
against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, identifying 74 high-value fragment hits, including 23 non-covalent and
48 covalent hits in the active site, and 3 hits close to the dimerization interface 21. In here, we
applied the same technique to probe new druggable cavities in IMT Mpro. Although the difference
in scale of our experiment, we were able to identify five distinguishable sites in this form of the
protein (Fig. 3). Site #1 is the active site of chain A, in which fragment f2xe03 was identified
interacting with Glu166 N and Cys145 S. Interesting, a unique cavity marked as Site #3 was
identified in our experiments, bound to fragment f2xg02 by Arg4 main chain O. That cavity lies
between the interface of chains A and B, and is not present in Mpro which adopt a more closed
conformation. This new site and fragment could serve as an anchor for development of new
inhibitors targeting Mpro dimerization process, a mode of action that was too date only theorized
22
. Details about data processing and statistics are given in Table S3.
Crystal structure of C145S Mpro in complex with N and C-terminal residues
The tetramer peaks were crystallized and X-ray structure determined at 2.8 Å and Rwork/Rfree
of 0.20/0.24 (Table S2), revealing a new crystal form in which N-terminal chain B residues are
trimmed in the active site of chain A, occupying subsites S1-S5 (Fig. 4). Despite the site directed
mutagenesis of the catalytic cysteine to serine, electron density shows that Gln0 and Ser1 are noncovalently bound in the amino region, clearly indicating that the N-terminal cis-cleavage was
completed. At the S1 subsite, Gln0 NE2 interacts with Glu166 OE1 by a hydrogen bound (2.7 Å),
while Gln0 form interacts with Ser145 in the position of the native oxyanion hole (Fig. 4, Fig S8S9). To accommodate the hydrophobic sidechain of Leu-1 at P2, Met49 and Met165 are pushed
further of each other (Fig. S10), leading to a more opened groove of this subsite relatively to the
apo-state, explaining the ability of this subsite to accommodate a variety of hydrophobic side chain
residues, such as Leu, Met, Ile, Val and Phe 6,23. Yet, from the eleven endogenous recognition sites
of coronaviruses, S2 Leu carrying sequences are the ones in which M pro display higher catalytic
efficiency, highlighting the importance of this conformation for drug design. At subsites S3-S5,
the interactions of Val-2, Ala-3 and Ser-4 are mainly maintained by hydrogen bounds between the
polar residues of protein and peptide side chains (Fig. 4), which explains the ability of Mpro to
recognize a large variety of chain sequences at those positions.
The crystal structure of C145S Mpro revealed another important step in the maturation
process of Mpro. At the same time that chain B N-terminal additional residues are processed by
chain A, its C-terminal residues (301-306) are almost 180o twisted from its original position (Fig.
S11) and trimmed in the active site of a symmetric related chain B (Fig. 4) a phenomenon that was
also recently described by another group in both native and in a C145A Mpro mutant 24. During this
event, two C145A Mpro dimers appear to be linked by the interaction of the C-terminal and a
respective active site, assuming a tetrameric conformation (Fig. 5). Within the active site, Gln306
occupies the respective position of Gln0 at S1, while S2 is occupied by Phe305, increasing the

distance between Met49 and Met165 relatively to chain A bound to N-terminal (Fig. S10). As the
N-terminal residues, subsites S3-S5 interactions with C-terminal are mainly maintained by
hydrogen bounds between main chains (Fig 4).
The maturation process of Mpro and its impact on Drug discovery
Mpro is firstly produced as the Nsp5 domain of the viral polyproteins before they are
proteolytically processed into 15 or 16 non-structural proteins 12. Immediately after translation, the
immature form of Mpro would contain both N and C-terminal insertions that need self-processing
to generate the mature form of the enzyme 13.
The biochemical assays of IMT Mpro revealed that a minor insertion at the N-terminal
produces a protein form that behaves as a monomer in solution and its almost depleted of
enzymatic activity, even though the general folding remains similar to the full mature form. The
same process occurs to C145S Mpro with native N-terminal inserted residues, although, in this case,
a slow cleavage of the N-terminus results in the formation of dimers overtime (Fig. 1). It is
important to highlight that when Mpro is added to C145S Mpro, the N-terminal cleavage and dimer
formation does not seem to be enhanced, strongly suggesting that this initial maturation step is a
cis-cleavage event. This is in agreement with the model proposed by Li and colleagues (2010) in
which two Mpro form a transient dimer that is stabilized by the binding the N-terminal site of its
substrate (another Mpro in polyprotein) and further cleave to free its N terminus 14.
After the active site region is matured (or even concomitantly), dimeric Mpro, C-terminal
seem to assume an unusual twisted position (Fig. S11), allowing it to be docked into the active site
of another mature or half-mature Mpro dimer (Fig. 4). In this step, the trans-cleavage processing of
the C-terminal residues would serve as an anchor for a transitory tetrameric state of the protein,
herein captured with the construct of the mutant C145S Mpro with the processing of the N-terminal
residues (Fig. 5). As a result, full mature Mpro is produced and its ready to process other parts of
the viral polyprotein. During all those maturation processes, both Mpro active site and surface
undergo significant conformational changes, which could guide targeted drug development (Fig.
6 and Scheme S1). Our results not only shed light in the self-maturation process of SARS-CoV-2
Mpro, but also bring the perspective of developing drugs targeting intermediate states of this
enzyme.

Supplementary Materials
Cloning and expression of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro forms
The viral cDNA template (GenBank MT126808.1), kindly provided by Dr. Edison Durigon (University of
São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil), was synthetized using the SCRIPT One-Step RT-PCR kit (Cellco Biotec) and random
hexamers primers. For production of IMT Mpro, coding region of Mpro (residues 3264-3569) was amplified using
primers:
Fw
5’
CAGGGCGCCATGAGTGGTTTTAGAAAAATGGCATTC
3’
and
Rv
5’
GACCCGACGCGGTTATTGGAAAGTAACACCTGAGAC 3’, and the sequence was inserted into the pET_M11
vector, which encodes an N-terminal 6xHis-tag followed by a TEV protease cleavage site (ENLYFQ↓GAM), using
the LIC method (25), forming the plasmid pET_M11-IMT-Mpro. To obtain the mature form of Mpro, native N-terminal
residues (GAMSAVLQ↓SGFRK) were inserted into pET_M11-IMT-Mpro by inverse PCR using primers: Fw: 5’
GCTGCAGAGTGGTTTTAGAAAAATGGCATTC 3’ and Rv: 5’ ACGGCTGACATGGCGCCCTGAAAATA 3’.
Amplified product was treated with T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (PNK, Thermo Fischer Scientific) and T4 Ligase
(Cellco Biotec), forming plasmid pET_M11- Mpro. For C145S Mpro construct, pET_M11- Mpro was used as template
for inverse PCR with primers Fw 5’ CCTTAATGGTTCATCTGGTAGTG 3’ and Rv 5’
AATGAACCCTTAATAGTGAAATTGG 3’. The PCR product was digested with DpnI (NEB), followed by
treatment with PNK and T4 DNA ligase, forming the pET_M11-C145S-Mpro. All plasmids were transformed in DH5α
E. coli competent cells. All PCRs were conducted with FastPol (Cellco Biotech). Positive clones were selected and
confirmed by sequencing. Schematics of constructs are given in Fig. S1.
For protein production, E. coli BL21 cells were transformed with respective plasmids and cultured in ZYM5052(26) at 37oC and 200 RPM to an OD600 of 0.8, followed by expression at 18 °C, 200 RPM for 16 h. Cells were
harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 40 min at 4 °C, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.8, 150 mM
NaCl, 1 mM DTT), disrupted by sonication and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 30 min at
4 °C.

Protein purification of IMT Mpro
After expression, a large amount of IMT Mpro had its 6xHis-tag cleaved by autoproteolytic process. The small
fraction of 6xHis tagged protein was removed from the lysate using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen). The cleaved protein was
purified by adding 1 M ammonium sulfate to the cell lysate followed by incubation on ice for 10 min. The precipitated
protein was recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C, resuspended in gel filtration buffer (20 mM
Tris pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT) and purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad
26/100 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with gel filtration buffer. Purified fractions were
aliquoted, flash-frozen and stored at -80 °C for enzymatic assays and crystallization. For crystallization, protein was
concentrated to 14 mg.mL-1 using 10 kDa MWCO centrifugal concentrators (Vivaspin, Sartorius). Protein
concentrations were determined using the measured absorbances at 280 nm and the theorical extinction coefficient of
32,890 M-1.cm-1. Protein purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. S1).

Protein purification of Mpro
Mpro was purified similar to IMT Mpro, with an additional step of cation exclusion chromatography. After the
size exclusion chromatography, the protein was buffer exchanged to 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM DTT, and then injected
into a Mono-Q 5/50 GL column (GE Healthcare). Protein was eluted using a linear gradient of a buffer containing 20
mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl and 1 mM DTT. Finally, fractions containing the purified protein were buffer exchanged
to gel filtration buffer. Purified fractions were aliquoted and protein was concentrated and quantified similarly to IMT
Mpro (Fig. S1).

Protein purification of C145S M pro
For C145S Mpro, protein was purified by immobilized metal chromatography (IMAC) using a 5 mL HisTrap
FF column (GE Healthcare). After column washing with buffer A (20 mM Tris pH 7.8, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM
Imidazole), protein was eluted with buffer A supplemented with 250 mM imidazole. Sample was buffer exchanged
using a 5 mL HiTrap desalting column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A. To remove the 6xHis-tag, 2 mg
of TEV protease and 4 mM DTT were added to the sample and incubated for 16 h at 4 ºC. Next day, non-cleaved
protein and TEV were removed by a second step of IMAC in buffer A. Finally, the protein was purified by size16

exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with gel filtration
buffer. Purified fractions were aliquoted, and protein was concentrated and quantified as described for other
constructions (Fig. S1).

Crystallization
Crystallization screening was performed with the sitting drop vapor diffusion method in 96 -well plates
using a Phoenix Liquid Handling System-Gryphon LCP (Art Robbins Instruments) and commercially available
kits at 20 °C. For Mpro, crystals appeared after 1 day in 0.1 M Bis-Tris pH 6.5, 25% PEG 3,350, which were cryoprotected using the reservoir solution and 30% PEG 400. Crystals of IMT Mpro were observed in several conditions.
After optimization, crystals grown in 0.1 M MES pH 6.5, 10% 2-propanol, 20% PEG Smear Low (BCS Screen,
Molecular Dimensions) were used as seeds for the diffraction crystals, obtained in 0.1 M MES pH 6.7, 5% DMSO,
8% PEG 4,000 (21). Crystals of C145S Mpro were obtained after 3 days in 0.1 M phosphate/citrate, pH 5.5, 20% v/v
PEG Smear High (BCS Screen, Molecular Dimensions).

Data collection and processing at MANACA Beamline
During the initial commissioning phase (July to October 2020) the MANACA (MAcromolecular Micro and
NAno CrystAllography)(27) beamline adopted an emergency commissioning plan to deliver the basic instrumentation
to perform data collection of SARS-CoV-2 related samples. Thus, during this period, the beamline has operated on a
fixed-energy regime (9 keV) with manual crystal mounting, single-axis goniometry, beam flux estimated to be about
1·1011 ph/s/10 mA at 9.15 keV and adjustable beam size from about 18 (h) x 20 (v) µm² to 100 (h) x 80 (v) µm²
(FWHM). This project was the first external user session at MANACA beamline and the first operating beamline at
Sirius (SIRIUS, Brazil). The focus was optimised to 61 (h) x 48 (v) µm² at sample position (Fig. S3). Even without
the full capabilities, the beamline opening was very important to SARS-CoV-2 structural biology studies.
X-ray data for apo IMT Mpro was collected from three isomorphous independent crystals, that were processed
by XDS via autoPROC (28, 29). Data herein was used for confirm reliability of the beamline (Fig. S5 and Table S1).
Datasets were then scaled and merged using Aimless (30), and the resulting dataset was used for structural
determination of IMT Mpro by molecular replacement with Phaser (31) using PDB 5RGQ as template. Model was
refined with COOT(32) and BUSTER (33) at 1.6 Å and deposited under the code 7KFI.
X-ray data for mature Mpro and C145S Mpro were processed by XDS via autoPROC (28, 29) and scaled using
Aimless (30). Mature Mpro and C145S Mpro were solved by molecular replacement with Phaser (31) using template
models 5RGQ and 7KFI, respectively. Mature Mpro and C145S Mpro were refined with COOT(32) and phenix.refine
(34), and are respectively deposited under the codes 7KPH (at 1.4 Å) and 7KVG (at 2.8 Å). Details of data processing
parameters and statistics are given in Table S2.

Fragment Screening of IMT Mpro
For the fragment screening of IMT Mpro, we used the settled plates fragment libraries of FragMAXlib (Talibov
et al., to be published) and F2XEntry (35, 36). In those plates, the content of each drop-well was resuspended in 1.0
µL of 0.1 M MES pH 6.7, 5% DMSO (v/v), 8% PEG 4,000 (w/v), 30% PEG 400 (w/v), and crystals were added
afterwards. After 4 h soaking at room temperature, crystals were manually harvested and flash cooled for data
collection.
During the commissioning phase of MANACA, 166 of those crystals were tested, leading to 77 usable
datasets. To analyze the data, a simplified version of FragMAXapp was configurated in our laboratory end-station
computer. Within FragMAXapp, restrictions libraries were generated by phenix.eLBOW (37) using rm1 force field
for geometry optimization, and datasets were processed through autoPROC/STARANISO or DIALS via XIA2 (28,
38, 39). Molecular replacement and initial refinement were performed using DIMPLE (40) using PDB 7KFI as
template. To highlight electron density of weak binding events, map averaging and statistical modelling were
performed by PanDDA software (41). Models were refined with COOT(32) and phenix.refine (34). Details of data
processing and refinement statistics are given in Table S3.
Activity assays
All enzymatic assays were carried out using FRET-based substrate DABCYL-KTSAVLQ↓SGFRKME(EDANS)-NH2 in assay buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.3, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT). Mpro, IMT Mpro and C145S Mpro
assays were performed at final concentration of 0.14 μM, 0.3 µM and 0.3 µM, respectively. Prior to reactions, enzymes

were incubated in assay buffer at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by substrate addition. To determine the kinetics
parameters (Km, Vmax and kcat), the substrate was diluted to a range of concentrations from 100 μM to 0.78 μM. Initial
velocity was derived from the slope of linear phase of each time-curse reaction, and Michaelis-Menten fitting was
obtained using Origin Pro 9.5.1 Software (OriginLab). Fluorescence measures were performed in SpectraMax Gemini
EM Microplate Reader with λexc/λemi of 360/460 nm, every 30 s over 60 min at 37º C. All assays were performed in
triplicates.
To test C145S Mpro auto-cleavage activity, 6xHis-tagged C145S Mpro was buffer exchanged in 20 mM Hepes
pH 7.3, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT. Two reactions were prepared for comparison, one containing 10 µM C145S Mpro
and other containing 10 µM C145S Mpro and 5 nM of mature Mpro. Aliquots of each reactions were collected for the
period of 40h. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% SDS polyacrylamide gel.

Differential Scanning Fluorimetry
For differential scanning fluorimetry assays (DSF), SYPRO Orange at 5X final concentration was added to
protein diluted to 25 μM protein in gel filtration buffer. Denaturation curves was obtained ranging temperature from
25°C to 75°C increasing one degree per cycle and fluorescence was measured in the end of each cycle. Experiment
was conducted in a qPCR system Mx3000P (Agilent). The melting temperature was obtained using the Boltzmann
fitting on Origin Pro 9.5.1 Software (OriginLab).

In solution oligomeric state of M pro constructs
The in solution oligomeric states of the purified samples were evaluated by size exclusion chromatography
coupled with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) in running buffer composed by 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8 and
100 mM NaCl. For that, 50 µL of each Mpro construct at concentration of 10 µM were injected in a Waters 600 HPLC
system (Waters) coupled in-line with an UV detector, a miniDAWN TREOS multi-angle light scattering apparatus
(Wyatt Technology), a column Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL (GE Healthcare), and a refractive index detector
Optilab T-rEX (Wyatt Technology). The light-scattering detectors were normalized with bovine serum albumin
(Sigma-Aldrich). Data were collected and analyzed with the ASTRA 7 integrated software provided by Wyatt. The
flow rate used was 0.5 mL/min. Results are summarized in Table S4.

Scheme S1. Schematic showing steps of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro maturation process. The immature monomeric form of

blue and salmon, respectively. N and C terminals are marked in green and blue, respectively. Polyprotein is shown as
black lines.
