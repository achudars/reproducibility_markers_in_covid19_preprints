Significance
Unraveling the molecular basis for host cell receptor usage among β-CoVs is crucial to our
understanding of cross-species transmission, adaptation and for molecular-guided
epidemiological monitoring of potential outbreaks. In the present study, we survey the
sequence conservation patterns of the β-CoV spike protein family to identify the evolutionary
constraints shaping the functional specificity of the protein across the β-CoV lineage. ​We
show that the unsupervised analysis of statistical patterns in a MSA of the spike protein
family can help tracing the amino acid space encoding the specificity of ​β-CoVs to their
cognate host cell receptors. We argue that the results obtained in this work can provide a
framework for monitoring the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 specificity to the hACE2 receptor, as
the virus continues spreading in the human population and differential virulence starts to
arise.
Abstract
The recent emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 in China and its rapid spread in the human
population has led to a public health crisis worldwide. Like in SARS-CoV, horseshoe bats
currently represent the most likely candidate animal source for SARS-CoV-2. Yet, the
specific mechanisms of cross-species transmission and adaptation to the human host
remain unknown. Here we show that the unsupervised analysis of conservation patterns
across the β-CoV spike protein family, using sequence information alone, can provide rich
information on the molecular basis of the specificity of β-CoVs to different host cell receptors.
More precisely, our results indicate that host cell receptor usage is encoded in the amino
acid sequences of different CoV spike proteins in the form of a set of specificity determining
positions (SDPs). Furthermore, by integrating structural data, ​in silico mutagenesis and
coevolution analysis we could elucidate the role of SDPs in mediating ACE2 binding across
the Sarbecovirus lineage, either by engaging the receptor through direct intermolecular
interactions or by affecting the local environment of the receptor binding motif. Finally, by the
analysis of coevolving mutations across a paired MSA we were able to identify key
intermolecular contacts occurring at the spike-ACE2 interface. These results show that
effective mining of the evolutionary records held in the sequence of the spike protein family
can help tracing the molecular mechanisms behind the evolution and host-receptors
adaptation of circulating and future novel β-CoVs.

Introduction
The emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 and its ability to infect humans underscores the
epidemic potential of coronaviruses, with the ongoing outbreak being the third documented
event in humans in the last two decades ​(1, 2)​. To date (August 2020), there have already
been more than 20 million reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide and over 770,000 deaths
(​https://covid19.who.int/​) ​(3)​.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses known for infecting a wide
range of hosts ​(4)​. Together with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, OC43 and HKU1 from the β-CoV
genus, and ​229E and NL63 from the ɑ-CoV genus, ​SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh confirmed
CoV able to infect humans. While 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1 widely circulate in the
human population and mostly cause mild disease manifestations in immunocompetent
individuals, SARS and MERS CoVs are mainly spread in zoonotic reservoirs, with different
intermediate host putatively involved in human transmission ​(4)​. CoV entry into the host cells
is mediated by the spike glycoprotein, a membrane-anchored homotrimer consisting of two
distinct subunits: S1, responsible of viral-host recognition and S2, promoting virus-cell
membrane fusion ​(5, 6)​. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 S has been reported to bind
the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as a cellular entry receptor via the
receptor binding domain (RBD), located in the C-terminal region of the S1 subunit ​(7)​.
Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV belong to the Sarbecovirus subgenus, their spike
proteins share more than 75% sequence identity and show similar RBD architecture and
mode of binding to the human receptor ​(8)​. However, structural and biophysical evidence
showed that SARS-CoV-2 S exhibits a 10- to 20-fold increased affinity to hACE2 compared
to its SARS counterpart ​(7) and, compared to other β-CoVs, possesses unique features such
as a putative O-glycosylation site and a polybasic cleavage site ​(9)​. The latters are invoked
as key factors to be monitored towards understanding the differential virulence of
SARS-CoV-2, while determinants of host adaptation and cellular tropism are mainly found
within the S1 subunit ​(7, 10)​.
Like in SARS-CoV, horseshoe bats represent the most likely candidate animal source for
SARS-CoV-2 so far ​(11)​. Yet, the specific mechanisms of cross-species transmission and
adaptation to the human host remain unknown. Here, we survey the sequence patterns of
the β-CoV spike protein family to elucidate the molecular events involved in the differential
host-pathogen interaction patterns observed across β-CoVs. ​Our results show that
receptor specificity is encoded in the amino acid sequences of different β-CoVs spike
proteins in the form of a set of specificity determining positions (SDPs). We argue that
both the methodology and results presented in this work can help tracing the molecular
mechanisms behind the evolution and host-receptors adaptation of circulating and future
novel coronaviruses.
Methods
Sequence dataset and multiple sequence alignment. A BLAST search was performed
against the NCBI nr database using the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (​NCBI Reference
Sequence​: ​YP_009724390.1​) as a query ​(12)​. The top 1000 significant hits (e-value <0.05)
were selected and clustered to identify non redundant sequences using CD-Hit ​(13) with the
following parameters: -​ ​s 0.90 -c 0.98. Cluster representatives were used to build a multiple
sequence alignment (MSA) using the MAFFT software ​(14)​. The final alignment contained

135 spike protein sequences which were manually reviewed to annotate information on viral
strain, host organism and cell receptors using information extracted from the NCBI Protein
database, UniprotKB and the literature.
Detection of SDPs and spike protein subfamilies. The S3Det method ​(15) uses
multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) to identify differentially conserved positions
and sequence subfamilies within a given MSA. MSA positions that follow the
subfamily segregation are defined as specificity determining positions (SDPs) of the
family. ​Here, the unsupervised mode of S3Det was used in a two-level decomposition
analysis to identify SDPs linked to the spike protein family segregation between and within
β-CoV subgroups. Phylogenetic analysis was performed both on the full β-CoV MSA and for
individual subfamilies using the PhyML method ​(16)​ with default parameters.
Coevolution analysis. ​Coevolving MSA positions were identified by computing the MI-APC
(17)​. MI-APC is a mutual information (MI)-based score corrected by the average product
correction (APC) of the background noise and phylogenetic signal. To ensure robust
statistics, MSA columns were filtered according to percentage of gaps (<= 50%) and
Shannon entropy (>= avg - std), computed as follows:
H i = − ∑ f i (a)ln(f i (a))
a∈A

where H i is the Shannon entropy of the i -th MSA position, f i (a) is the frequency of amino
acid a in the i -th MSA position, and A is the alphabet of all possible amino acids.
Protein domain annotation and enrichment analysis. ​Domain enrichment analyses were
performed by hypergeometric testing and p-values computed as follows:

where ​x is the number of SDPs observed in a given domain of interest, ​k is the number of
SDPs in the test set, ​m is the length of the domain of interest and ​n + ​m is the size of the
protein. The analyses were performed both at the subunit and domain level. Annotations on
subunits and domain boundaries of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein were retrieved from
the literature ​(18) and mapped to the rest of human β-CoVs spike sequences used in this
analysis (SARS-CoV, MERS, OC43 and HKU1) based on the MSA.
Evolutionary rate analysis. ​Per-site evolutionary rates (EV) were computed by Rate4Site
(19) using as input the full MSA of the β-CoV spike family and phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 sequence was set as the reference sequence. Raw rate values were used to
compute relative rates by normalizing the values to the mean of 1 ​(20)​.
Structural dataset. ​All the structures employed in this study were retrieved from the PDB
(https://www.rcsb.org) using the following PDB codes: 6VSB ​(7)​, 6VXX ​(21)​, 6LZG ​(22)​,
5X5B ​(23)​, 5X58 ​(23)​, 2AJF ​(24)​, 6OHW ​(25)​, 6NZK ​(25)​, 5X5F ​(23)​, 4L72 ​(26) and 5I08
(27)​.
Results
SDPs as predictors of receptor specificity across the β-CoV lineage
Here we aim at analysing the effect of evolutionary constraints in shaping the organisation of
the spike protein family across the ​β-CoV lineage. To this aim, we use a multivariate-based
protocol which allows the automatic and simultaneous detection of both the protein family
segregation and associated amino acid variations, i.e. SDPs.

A phylogenetic analysis was performed based on a MSA of the full-lenght spike sequences
from SARS-CoV-2 and other representative β-CoVs. The resulting tree, shown in Figure 1A,
reflects the taxonomic classification of β-CoVs into five subgenera, namely Sarbecovirus,
Hibecovirus, Nobecovirus, Embecovirus and Merbecovirus ​(29)​. A first S3Det analysis was
performed on individual protein subfamilies from the Sarbecovirus, Embecovirus and
Merbecovirus subgroups. In the case of Sarbecovirus, we identified three different clusters,
two of which correspond to known Sarbecovirus clades ​(30)​. Notably, in contrast to what
observed based on phylogenetic analysis, both SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are clustered
together with members of Sarbecovirus clade 1, which includes human SARS-CoV and bat
SARS-like sequences (Figure 1B-C). This result is confirmed by the analysis of similarity
scoring matrices (Supplementary Figure S1) where SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV
sequences cluster together and are closer to the green cluster based on the similarity of
SDPs, but not when the full-length sequence is considered. Within the Embecovirus group,
we identified three clusters: a first cluster corresponding to murine CoVs (MHV), a second
containing rat (RtCoVs) and human CoVs (CoV-HKU1), and a third cluster containing the
human CoV hCoV-OC43 and other mammalian CoVs (Supplementary Figure S2-A,C).
Within the Merbecovirus, we identified four clusters: a first cluster containing MERS and
MERS-like bat CoVs, a second cluster containing hedgehog and bat CoVs, a third cluster
containing HKU5 bat CoVs, and a fourth cluster containing one single bat CoV isolate
(KW2E-F93) from the Nycteria species (Supplementary Figure S2-B,D).
The SDPs associated with the subfamily segregation within these three subgenera display a
strong domain enrichment within the spike S1 subunit (Figure 2, Supplementary Table S1).
Specifically, the SDPs (n = 28) of Sarbecovirus subfamilies, containing both SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 spike sequences, are enriched in the RBD whereas in hCoV-OC43 and
hCoV-HKU1, the human-pathogenic species belonging to Embecovirus, SDPs (n = 12) fall
mainly in an upstream region of the spike, with a significant enrichment in the NTD. Also in
MERS-CoV we observe a significant enrichment within the S1 subunit. However, as shown
in Figure 2, the SDPs (n = 33) are almost evenly distributed across the NTD and RBD
regions, with a significant enrichment in the latter (Supplementary Table S2). ​Notably, the
distribution of the SDPs shows a clear relationship with the cell receptor usage
observed among β-CoVs. In particular, hCoV-HKU1 and hCoV-OC43 are known to bind
sialic acid receptors on the host cells via the spike NTD ​(31)​, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
recognize the ACE2 receptors via the RBD ​(32, 33)​, while MERS-CoV has been reported to
use both DPP4 ​(34) and sialic acid receptors ​(35) via the RBD and NTD domains,
respectively.
In summary, the SDPs found within these β-CoV subgenera define a specific region of
the receptor binding domains: they are part of, or in direct contact with, the ACE2
interacting surface (Figure 3, Supplementary Figure S3); have a relative low impact on
protein stability (Supplementary Figure S4); and have evolved quite recently
(Supplementary Figure S5). These characteristics point to a key role of SDPs in
mediating the functional specificity of the protein subfamily, i.e. the recognition of the
host-cell receptor.
A second S3Det analysis was performed on the full β-CoV MSA. As shown in Figure 1A-D,
the identified sequence subfamilies are consistent with the phylogenetic classification of
Betacoronavirus into five subgenera ​(29)​. In this case, the SDPs linked to the full β-CoV
spike family segregation are mainly located in the S2 protein subunit, with a statistically

significant enrichment in regions corresponding to interdomain 4, domain HR1 and
interdomain 5 (Figure 2, Supplementary Table S1-S2). These SDPs show characteristics of
sites under structural ​constraints ​(36)​, ​i.e. slowly evolving sites (Supplementary Figure S5)
buried within the 3D structure of the protein (Supplementary Figure S3) and potentially
destabilizing (see results of ​in silico​ mutagenesis experiments in Supplementary Figure S4).
Collectively, these results indicate that SDPs capture the functional diversification
observed within the individual protein subfamilies, whereby host-cell receptor
specificity arises in the context of a structural framework that is specific to each
β-CoV phylogenetic group.
Relationship between SDPs and ACE2 binding across the Sarbecovirus lineage
Structural and mutagenesis studies have shown that the spike RBD of Sarbecovirus
contains all the necessary information for host receptor binding and that a few amino acid
substitutions in this region can lead to efficient cross-species transmission ​(30, 37)​. Binding
to ACE2 is clade-specific and occurs at the carboxy-terminal region of the RBD, by an
extended concave loop subdomain which forms the interaction interface with the ACE2
N-terminal helix. Notably, both the ACE2-contacting residues and the surrounding amino
acids, collectively referred to as the receptor binding motif (RBM), are required to impart
human receptor usage within the Sarbecovirus lineage ​(30)​. Consistently, we observe that
several SDPs associated with the Sarbecovirus subfamily fall within the RBM, ​i.e.,
Y451/Y438, L461/L448, T470/N457, C488/C474, P491/P477, G496/G482, G502/G488,
P507/P493, Y508/Y494 on SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV sequences, respectively (Figure 3). Of
these, Y494 has been previously reported as critical for ACE2 binding ​(38)​. Two SDPs,
namely G496 and G502, fall within the receptor interface forming two hydrogen bonds with
the ACE2 K353. Other SDPs, such as L461, T470, C488, P491 and G496 make direct
contact with ACE2 contacting residues. Hence, these SDPs are likely to play an important
role in ACE2 binding by affecting the local orientation of ACE2 contacting residues. This
hypothesis is further supported by results from ​in silico mutagenesis and coevolution
analysis (details in next section). Specifically, we tested the effect of amino acid mutations
across the RBM by mutating the SARS-CoV-2 sequence to ​the consensus spike sequence
from clade 2, i.e. a clade known to be incompatible with hACE2 usage ​(30)​. ​Notably, while
most substitutions are predicted to have a destabilizing effect on the Spike-hACE2
complex, mutations of SDP residues are predicted to have a significantly larger
impact compared to non-SDP residues (Figure 4).
Molecular coevolution analysis
Computational methods exploiting coevolution signals in MSAs of protein families are widely
used to infer features such as molecular interactions and functional sites ​(15, 39–41)​. Such
signals arise from the specific adaptation between correlated amino acid sites, where
changes in one site are potentially compensated by changes in the other. In the case at
hand, coevolution signatures are used as markers for the study of the physical interactions
occurring between different sites of the spike as well as between the spike and their cognate
host cell receptor ACE2. As it can be observed in Supplementary Figure S6, the strongest
intramolecular coevolution signal, considering the top-500 predictions, is observed over the
RBD region of the spike (the overall precision of the method is reported in Supplementary
Figure S7). Figure 5 shows in detail the RBM region, which presents above average

precision and recall values of 46% and 4.6%, respectively. Among the SDPs (highlighted in
green), the precision is even higher, around 62%, and the recall is 8.7%. ​Notably, 18% of
SDPs found within the Sarbecovirus subgenus show a coevolution signal with ACE2
contacting residues, namely Y489 (coevolving with C488, P491), Q493 (coevolving
with L461, T470, C488, P491) and Q498 (coevolving with G496). These three positions
are hubs on the interface with ACE2, making direct contact with positions T27, F28,
K31 and Y83, positions K31, H34 and E35, and positions D38, Y41, Q42 and L45 of
ACE2, respectively ​(22)​. Particularly, position Q493/N479 in SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV has
been described to be critical for high affinity binding of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 to
ACE2 ​(42, 43)​. Furthermore, it is interesting to notice that the C488/C474 SDP in
SARS-CoV-2/SARS-CoV is an important position for the stability of the RBM as a whole and
a complete loss of hACE2 binding ​in vitro has been described when this position is mutated
to Alanine in SARS-CoV ​(44)​.
We next performed a coarse-grained coevolutionary analysis on a concatenated MSA
containing eight spike proteins and their cognate ACE2 receptors. Contact predictions were
obtained by computing the MI-APC score for every inter-protein pair of alignment positions,
considering the RBD region of the spike protein and the whole ACE2. Interestingly, three
RBM positions were found coupled to ACE2 positions among the top-10 MI-APC scores
(Supplementary Figure S8). Specifically, the ACE2 residue H34 was coupled to L455, S494
and Q498 on the spike protein. Additionally, the spike positions R346 and L455 were
coupled to ACE2 residues Q24, N61, Q81, M82 and to E23, T27 and H34, respectively.
Among these predictions, T27-L455, H34-L455 and H34-S494 correspond to true contacts
within 8A distance, while the couplings between R346 and ACE2 positions could be related
to long-range effects. Notably, positions E23 and H34 have been described as crucial to
SARS-CoV binding to ACE2 ​(45)​. Also, L455 was described as important for the stabilisation
of a binding hotspot between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 ​(43)​. Interestingly, a recent study
reported that ACE2 variants E23K and T27A are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, while
variant H34R decreases SARS-CoV-2 affinity ​(46)​. ​These results, despite the limited
number of sequences in the concatenated alignment, point to at least three specific
RBM viral positions (L455, S494 and Q498 in SARS-CoV-2) likely ​adapted to their
species-specific counterparts.
Evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein during the spread in human populations
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak and the isolation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus,
laboratories around the world are continuously isolating viral genomic sequences with
unprecedented speed, enabling nearly real-time data sharing of more than 80,000 genomic
sequences so far ​(47)​.
After discarding partial sequences, a multiple sequence alignment was built based on a total
of ​44,812 ​SARS-CoV-2 ​spike​ sequences isolated from human samples in 96 countries.
Our analysis of missense amino acid variations confirmed earlier reports ​(48) that most
mutations occur within the S1 subunit, with a dominant variant observed at position ​614,
where more than 75% of samples carry the D614G mutation, followed by mutations ​L4F and
R21I appearing in 337 and 307 samples, respectively. Within the RBD, the top frequent
mutations are S477N, T478I and P479S, found in 68, 63, and 53 samples, respectively.
Notably, these positions fall within the RBM, forming a ​surface-exposed loop that is
proximal to the ACE2 binding surface, and that is absent in Sarbecovirus clades 2 and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.21.260745; this version posted August 21, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

3 ​(30)​. Although previous experiments indicate that this loop is ​per se not sufficient to impart
ACE2 receptor usage, deletions of this region are associated with reduced spike expression
and loss of cell entry ​(30)​. Hence, mutations in this region are expected to impact the
stability of the protein, rather than its affinity to the receptor.
Finally, perhaps not surprisingly, ​the frequency of variants at SDPs is very low, with an
overall variability that is comparable to that observed in ACE2-contacting residues
(Supplementary Figure S9). Mutations are observed in 7 out 14 SDPs. With the exception of
T385A and Y508, that are observed in 2 and 4 samples, respectively, all other mutations are
only present in one sample. Mostly, these variants are predicted to be neutral or to
destabilize the binding to the receptor (Supplementary Figure S10B). ​In summary, the low
frequency of mutations in SDPs fulfils the requirement to preserve a functional role of
those positions, providing an additional evidence of their involvement in the
interaction with the host cell receptor.
Discussion
The relationship between protein family segregation and their functional organisation has
been extensively investigated for decades and a variety of computational methods have
been developed to infer their evolutionary link at the residue level ​(49–51)​. It is therefore
relatively straightforward to identify the amino acid positions that modulate the functional
specificity of a given enzyme towards a substrate or cofactor ​(15) or the binding specificity of
a protein-ligand or protein-protein interaction ​(52, 53) by the analysis of the differential
conservation patterns within the MSA of a protein family. Here we apply this concept to the
analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike in the context of a MSA of homologous sequences
belonging to the β-CoV genus. The SDP analysis is based on a vectorial representation of
protein sequences and amino acid positions in a multidimensional space to simultaneously
identify the family segregation and the residue positions that better explain the sources of
variation of the family ​(15)​.
On one hand, the analysis performed at the β-CoV family level led to the identification of five
sequence subfamilies, reflecting the known phylogenetic classification of Betacoronavirus
into five subgenera ​(29) (Figure 1A). On the other hand, the analysis performed on individual
β-CoV subgenera, i.e. Sarbecovirus, Merbecovirus and Embecovirus subgroups, allowed a
fine-grained classification into subfamily clusters that clearly reflect the functional
diversification of the spike protein family, that is, the specificity to different host-cell receptors
(Figure 2-3). Indeed, both the clustering and domain enrichment results of the associated
SDPs consistently reproduce the known cell receptor specificities observed across the
different β-CoV lineages ​(26, 54–56)​. At the level of the Sarbecovirus group, for example,
both SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are clustered together with SARS-CoV and other SARS-like
sequences from bats (Figure 1C), reflecting the ability of these members of the Sarbecovirus
group to bind the ACE2 cell receptor ​(57)​. Notably, the proximity of SARS-CoV-2 and
RaTG13 and other SARS-CoV sequences based on key SDP positions is different to what
seen based on full sequence phylogenetic analysis, where they form distinct clades. ​A
proximity that is driven by their shared SDPs and it is interpreted here in terms of
their shared ability to bind the human ACE2 receptor.
As it is often the case, functional constraints arise from the requirement of maintaining the
interaction of proteins with other macromolecules or ligands. Such constraints translate into
specific roles and properties of individual amino acids, or protein sites. In the case at hand,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.21.260745; this version posted August 21, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

the analysis of the physicochemical, structural and conservation properties of the SDPs of
the different subfamilies highlights a pattern that is typical of protein functional sites, as they
show high conservation across the protein family, are solvent exposed, and are enriched in
the receptor binding domains (Supplementary Figures S3-5 and Supplementary Table S2).
Hence, in order to assess the role of the SDPs in mediating ACE2 receptor usage across the
Sarbecovirus group, we set up an in silico mutagenesis study and analysed the effect of
amino acid mutations across the RBM and their impact on ACE2 binding. Notably, while our
results are in line with previous observations ​(30)​, they point to specific ​positions across the
RBM that might exert a critical role, either by engaging the receptor through direct
intermolecular contacts or by affecting the local orientation of ACE2 contacting residues and
the stability of the RBM as a whole.
Collectively, these results point to a key role of SDPs in mediating host cell receptor
specificity across ​β-CoVs and provide, at the same time, a framework for monitoring
the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 specificity to hACE2, as well as the emergence of
novel potential cross-species transmission events. As such, it is important to notice that
from the analysis of amino acid variations across the circulating SARS-CoV-2 virus, SDPs
tend to mutate with a very low frequency, similar to what is seen at ACE2 contacting sites
(Supplementary Figure S9) ​(58)​. This is of relevance, as our results suggest that mutations
in SDPs can significantly impact the receptor-binding ability of the spike. Furt​hermore, ​the
experience in other scenarios has shown that mutating SDPs is, in general, sufficient to
transform the properties between two groups of proteins of the same family, ​i.e. the
interchange of the residues occupying the SDPs between two families implies a change in
the associated biological properties ​(59–63)​. Notable examples include the production of
switch-of-function mutants of small GTPases with changed selectivity, or the change of
transport specificity between ​MIP channel proteins by few amino acid substitutions ​(60, 62)​.
In line with this reasoning, it can be argued that other members of the Sarbecovirus group
might have the potential to acquire ACE2 binding ability, as they share substantial similarity
in terms of SPDs. This is especially the case of members of the Sarbecovirus green cluster,
which despite being phylogenetically distant to SARS-CoV-2, display identical residues in 10
out of 14 SDP positions within the RBD, making them potential candidates for new human
infections.
In conclusion, the results presented here show that the identification of evolutionary
patterns based on the analysis of sequence information alone can provide meaningful
insights on the molecular basis of host-pathogen interactions and adaptation. We
believe that both the methodology and results presented in this work can provide the basis
for follow-up studies analysing the potential routes of mutations that could lead to new
adaptation to human hosts and ultimately contribute to better understanding and monitoring
of events that are critical to public health concerns worldwide.
