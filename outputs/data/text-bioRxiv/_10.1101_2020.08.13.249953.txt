Abstract:
Serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is impeded by immunological cross-reactivity to
the human coronaviruses (HCoV) SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, OC43,
229E, HKU1, and NL63. Here we report the identification of humoral immune responses
to SARS-CoV-2 and other HCoV peptides that can be used to detect asymptomatic,
mild and, severe SARS-CoV-2 infections, and may enable the discovery of biomarkers
for immunity following infection or vaccination.

Main text:
Differential serodiagnosis of human coronavirus (HCoV) exposure may be challenging
due to cross-reactive immunity to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, OC43,
229E, HKU1, NL631-3. Specific plaque reduction neutralization tests are labor-intensive,
require work with live virus in high-level containment facilities, and detect only
neutralizing antibodies. Here we report the use of proteome-wide high-density peptide
microarrays to detect specific humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and other
HCoV.
We established a microarray comprising >172,000 “12-amino acid (aa)” nonredundant
peptides that tile the proteomes of known HCoVs with 11 amino acid overlap 47
(Supplementary Table 1). Using these arrays, we examined the immunoreactivity of
132 plasma samples collected at two timepoints from fifty patients with active or recent
SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 32 subjects including healthy controls, IgG positive for

SARS-CoV-1, and exposure to other HCoVs (Supplementary Table 2 and 3). Subjects
included 22 COVID-19 patients with severe illness (Group 1); 22 COVID-19 patients
with mild illness (Group 2); 6 subjects with asymptomatic SARS-COV-2 infection (Group
3); 11 subjects with SARS-CoV-1 infection (Group 4); 10 healthy subjects (Group 5),
and 11 subjects immunoreactive to other HCoV specific IgG ELISA. Plasma were heat
inactivated, diluted, hybridized on HCoV peptide arrays, incubated with goat anti-human
IgG and anti-human IgM antibodies, and scanned. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) was
performed for IgM and IgG antibodies to differentiate peptides that were
immunoreactive with COVID-19 patients (Groups 1-3) versus “non-COVID-19” control
groups (Group 4-6). Details of samples, experimental design and data analysis are
included in supplementary methods4-7.
IgM analysis revealed one linear epitope in the membrane glycoprotein
(MADSNGTITVEELKKLLEQWN), which was reactive in 4/22 (19%) COVID-19 patients
with mild disease and 8/22 (37%) patients with severe disease at late time point
collection (Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 4). IgG analysis revealed
37,237 peptides with statistically significant differences (p<0.05) in signal intensity
between COVID-19 and control plasma. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) enabled
separation of patients with COVID-19 (Groups 1-3) and controls (Groups 4-6) (Figure 1A). 981 SARS-CoV-2 peptides with IgG signal intensity >10,000 arbitrary unity (AU)
were used to assemble a heat map using R-Studio (Figure 1-B). Immunoreactive
peptides included 566 from ORF1ab, 3 from ORF10, 243 from surface glycoprotein (S
protein), 20 from ORF3a, 20 from membrane glycoprotein (mGP), 4 from ORF7a, 21
from ORF8, and 104 from nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N). Peptides from “S” and “N”
proteins had higher reactive intensity (higher AU) and rate of reactivity in comparison to
peptides from other proteins (Figure 1-B). Immunoreactivity was higher in COVID-19
patients with severe vs mild disease, and in asymptomatic SARS CoV-2 infected
subjects than in patients with mild disease. Samples from second timepoint collections
were more reactive than first timepoint collections in severe, mild and asymptomatic
SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1-B). The presence of three continuous peptides that
were reactive in samples from SARS-CoV-2 infection but not in control groups, were
used to define 163 SARS-CoV-2 specific epitopes (Supplementary Table 5). Twentynine epitopes were selected based on sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2
infection status (Table 1). These included 11 epitopes (37.9%) in S protein (SP1-SP11),
8 (27.5%) epitopes in N protein (NP1-NP8), 6 (20.7%) epitopes in ORF1ab polyprotein
(OP1-OP6), 2 (6.9%) in mGP protein (MP1 and MP2), one (3.4%) each from ORF3, and
ORF8 proteins (Supplementary Figure 2). Table 1 indicates the location of each epitope on
the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, its length, aa sequence, and the percentages of plasma
samples that were immunoreactive in Groups 1-6. Immunoreactivity was higher in second
time point plasma samples (Supplementary Figure 3) and in patients with more severe
disease. In samples from patients with severe disease, 7 to 22 epitopes (mean of 13)
were positive in second timepoint samples (24.8±6.8 days post onset of disease, POD)
vs 0 to15 (mean of 7) epitopes in first timepoint samples (9.6±3.5 days POD). In
patients with mild disease, 3 to 22 epitopes (mean of 8) were positive in second
timepoint samples (34.7±8.3 POD) vs 0 to 12 epitopes (mean of 4) in first timepoint
samples (12.9±5.9 POD). In asymptomatic subjects 1 to 9 epitopes (mean of 4) were

positive at either time point (day of hospitalization and 14.5±4.6 days after the
hospitalization). Plasma samples from 19 of 22 patients (86%) with mild disease were
reactive with at least 1 of 29 epitope at the first time point; all 22 (100%) were reactive
with at least 3 of 29 epitopes at the second time point. Plasma from 21 of 22 patients
(95%) with severe disease were reactive with at least 1 epitope at first timepoint; all 22
(100%) were reactive with at least 6 epitopes at the second time point. All 6 (100%)
asymptomatic cases were reactive with at least 2 of 29 epitopes in first and 3 of 29 in
second timepoint collections.
Through use of plasma from subjects with known exposure to other HCoV we identified
specific epitopes in HKU1 (n=15), NL63 (n=10), OC43 (n=14), 229E (n=5), and SARSCoV-1 (n=9) (Supplementary Table 6). We were unable to identify MERS-specific
epitopes due to lack of cognate sera. More than 90% of samples from patients exposed
to SARS-CoV-2 and controls showed a wide range of reactivity to epitopes from
seasonal coronaviruses (HKU1, NL63, OC43 and 229E). A Pre-COVID study from
Beijing, China showed that large proportions (>70%) of healthy children and adults have
evidence of anti-S IgG antibodies against these four HCoVs8. The immunoreactivity of
SARS-CoV-1 epitopes to SARS-CoV-2 infected patients can be explained by cross
reactivity due to proteome homology 2,3, and immunoreactivity of SARS-CoV-1 epitopes
in healthy controls maybe due to historical unknown exposure during SARS-2003
epidemic in Guangdong province 9,10.
The 29 immunoreactive epitopes were mapped to the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 (acc.
number MN908947) (Supplementary Figure 2). ORF1ab epitopes (OP1-OP6) were
dispersed throughout the protein. Eleven linear epitopes from “S” protein (SP1-SP11)
were mapped outside of the RBD (Receptor Binding Domain) (Figure 1-C). Four SP1SP4 epitopes were located in the SD1/SD2. Four SP5-SP8 epitopes were located
between SD1/SD2 and fusion peptide region. The SP9 epitope overlapped the Fusion
Peptide (FP). The SP10 epitope is located between CD (Connector Domain) region and
HR2 (Heptad Repeat 2). The SP11 epitope was located at the beginning of the HR2
region of the S2 subunit of the surface glycoprotein (Figure 1-C). The SP1, and SP9
peptides identified in this study were recently reported as potentially linked to
neutralization11. Ten of eleven spike epitopes (SP1-SP10) were located in regions of
high immunoreactivity in a recent pre-print from Li et al12. The SP10 epitope was the
most sensitive diagnostic spike epitope in subjects with severe (69% first time point,
96% second timepoint), mild (41% first timepoint, 82% second timepoint), and
asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 (67% either timepoint) infections. The NP2 and NP8
epitopes were the most sensitive “N” protein epitopes. In severe disease NP2
immunoreactivity was found in 55% of subjects at the first timepoint, and 82% at the
second timepoint. NP8 immunoreactivity was found in 64% of subjects at first timepoint,
and 100% at second time point. In mild disease, NP2 immunoreactivity was found in
37% of subjects at the first timepoint, and 69% at the second timepoint. NP8
immunoreactivity was found in 28% of subjects at the first timepoint, and 82% at the
second timepoint. In asymptomatic cases, immunoreactivity was 59% for either NP2 or
NP8. In severe disease SP11 immunoreactivity was found in 46% of subjects at the first
time point, and 91% at the second time point. In mild disease SP11 immunoreactivity

was found in 28% of subjects at the first time point, and 60% at the second time point.
No asymptomatic cases were immunoreactive with SP11. Epitopes for ORF1ab (OP1OP6) showed reactivity in cases with mild and severe disease at both timepoints but not
in asymptomatic infections. Only second timepoint samples from severe and mild
diseases were immunoreactive to epitopes for mGP, MP1 and MP2 (37% and 26% for
severe disease and 28% and 19% for mild disease)
The HCoV peptide array enabled serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and other
coronavirus infections. Immunoreactivity profiles differed with severity of illness and
over the timecourse of infection. The sensitivity of the array with this sample set was
92% at ~10-13 days POD, 100% at ~24-35 days POD with severe and mild COVID-19.
Assays were positive in all asymptomatic, hospitalized subjects; however, only six
subjects were examined and the duration of infection is unknown. The HCoV array
platform is too complex and expensive for routine clinical microbiology. However, the
peptides defined here can be transferred to a wide range of platforms including
microarrays, ELISA, RIA, lateral flow, western blot, and bead-based assays, where they
may facilitate diagnostics, epidemiology, and vaccinology.

Methods:
Human coronavirus (HCoV) peptide array design
We designed a programmable peptide microarray that can accommodate up to 3 million
distinct linear peptides on a 75mm x 26mm slide. The array can also be divided into 12
sub arrays, each containing approximately ~173,000 “12-mer peptides” (Nimble
Therapeutics Inc, WI, USA). The 12-mer format is based on the observation that serum
antibodies bind linear peptide sequences ranging from 5 to 9 amino acid (aa) and bind
most efficiently when targets are flanked by additional aa13. To enable differential
detection of antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2 infections, we created a database
comprising the proteomes of seven human coronaviruses: SARS-CoV-2, SARS, MERS,
NL-63, OC-43, 229E and HKU1 (Supplementary Table 1). We also included two bat
coronavirus proteomes similar to SARS-CoV-214. 1000 randomly selected 12 aa long
scrambled peptides were added for background correction and nonspecific binding of
peptides. For each virus selected, we downloaded all available protein sequences
available before January 2020 from the NCBI and Virus Pathogen Database and
Analysis Resource (VIPR) protein databases. We then created a peptide database
comprising overlapping 12-mer peptides that tiled the whole proteome of each of these
agents with 11 amino acid (aa) overlap in a sliding window pattern 4-7. The selected
peptide sequences were passed through a redundancy filter to yield 283630 unique
peptide sequences and 24779921 non-unique (present in more than one virus) for a
total of 172,665 peptides. Redundant peptides were excluded prior to synthesis. The
individual peptides in the library were printed in random positions on the peptide array to
minimize the impact of locational bias.
Samples & experimental design:
The study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Sun Yat-Sen University
(approval number 2020-060). An informed and written consent was obtained by

patients. A total 132 plasma samples were tested and analyzed using HCoV peptide
arrays (Supplementary Table 2). Samples were divided into six groups: group 1]
COVID-19 patients with non-severe (mild) disease (n=22); group 2] COVID-19 patients
with severe disease (n=22); group 3] patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections but nosymptoms (asymptomatic COVID-19) (n=6); group 4] SARS-2003 IgG positive cases
(n=11); group 5] other banked HCoV IgG positive controls (n=11) (Supplementary Table
3); and group 6] healthy controls (n=10). The average age was 44.0±16.73 years for the
mild COVID-19 group, 60.1±12.37 years for the severe COVID-19 group, and
43.5±15.08 years for the asymptomatic COVID-19 group. The average age for SARSCoV-1 IgG positive control group was 24.4±5.0 years. Plasma samples were collected
at two different time points, a minimum of two weeks apart, from group COVID-19
patients (groups 1, 2 and 3). The first time point (early) was collected at 12.9±5.9 post
onset of disease (POD) for the mild disease group, and at 9.6±3.5 days POD for the
severe disease group. The second time point (late was collected at 34.7±8.3 days POD
for the mild disease group, and at 24.8±6.8 days POD for the severe disease group. For
asymptomatic group, the first time point was collected on the day of hospitalization; the
second time point was collected at 14.5±4.6 days after the day of hospitalization. Non
COVID-19 samples from control groups (group 4, group 5 and group 6), were from
adults without any evidence or history of infection with SARS-CoV-2. All COVID-19
patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory specimens using the China
FDA approved Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real Time RT-PCR kit from LifeRiver
Ltd. (Catalog #: RR-0479-02) real-time RT-PCR15. The diagnosis of COVID-19
pneumonia, and severity criteria were assessed at Guangdong CDC based on the New
Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (6th edition) published by the
National Health Commission of China15. Other clinical information, comorbidities,
symptoms and treatment for COVID-19 for mild, severe, and asymptomatic cases are
presented in Supplementary Table 2.

Peptide synthesis was accomplished by light-directed array synthesis in a Nimble
therapeutics Maskless Array Synthesizer (MAS) using an amino-functionalized
substrate coupled with 6-amino hexanoic acid as a spacer and aa derivatives carrying a
photosensitive 2-(2-Nitrophenyl) propyl-oxy-carbonyl-group (NPPOC). Coupling of
amino acids was done using pre-activated amino acid with activator (HOBT/HBTU) and
Ethyl-di-iso-propylamine in DMF for 5–7 minutes before flushing the substrate. Cycles of
coupling were repeated until 12-mer peptides were synthesized. Intermediate washes
on the arrays were done with N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and site-specific cleavage
of the NPPOC group was accomplished by irradiation of an image created by a Digital
Micro-Mirror Device (Texas Instruments, SXGA+ graphics format), projecting light with a
365-nm wavelength. Final de-protection to cleave off the side-chain protecting groups of
the amino acids was done with Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/Water/ Trisopropylsilane for
30 minutes.
Before loading, plasma samples were heat inactivated at 560 C for 30 minutes. Plasma
samples were diluted (1:50) with binding buffer (0.1M Tris-Cl, 1% alkali soluble casein,
0.05% Tween-20, and water). The peptide arrays were incubated overnight at 4°C on a
flat surface with individual sample/sub-array. Overnight sample incubation was followed

by three 10-minute washes with 1X TBS-T (0.05% Tween-20) at room temperature
(RT). Secondary antibodies IgG (cat no. 109-605-098, Alexa Fluor 647-AffiniPure Goat
Anti- Human IgG, Fcy fragment specific, Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs) and IgM (cat
no. 109-165-129, Cy™3 AffiniPure Goat Anti-Human IgM, Jackson ImmunoResearch
Labs) were diluted in 1X PBS at a concentration of 0.1µg/ml, and arrays were incubated
in Plastic Coplin Jar (cat no. S90130, Fisher Scientific) for 3 hours at RT with gentle
shaking. Secondary antibody incubation was also followed by three 10-minute washes
with 1X TBST at RT. After a final wash, the arrays were dried and scanned on a
microarray scanner at 2-μm resolution, with an excitation wavelength of 635 nm (IgG)
and 532 nm (IgM). The images were analyzed using the PepArray analysis program.
The fluorescent signals were converted into arbitrary unit (AU) intensity plots ranging
minimum to maximum intensity 0-65,000 AU.
Experimental Design and data analysis:
We employed dilutions of 1:50 and called a peptide signal positive if it was above the
threshold (mean ±2 SD readings of random peptides, >10,000 Arbitrary unit (AU) for
IgG and IgM analysis). A cut-off threshold for peptide recognition was defined as mean
±2 times the standard deviation (SD) of the mean intensity value of all negative
controls16. The normalization, background correction and statistical comparison of
peptide microarray intensities between groups was performed using the edgeR
package17.
Data analysis for IgG and IgM:
Fold changes and standard errors were estimated by fitting a linear model for signal
intensities generated by each peptide, applying empirical Bayesian smoothing to the
standard errors, and then determining those peptides that yielded statistically significant
signal by contrasting linear models for each peptide between SARS-CoV2 and Control
samples at a significance value of <0.0518. The analysis was performed to differentiate
peptides that were immunoreactive with COVID-19 patients (groups 1, 2 and 3) and
versus control groups (groups 4, 5 and 6) samples. A multidimensional scaling (MDS)
plot was generated using signal data for these significant peptides. Signal data points
were filtered such that only peptides that showed signal >10,000 AU in any sample were
retained. For IgG, the >10,000 AU filtration step reduced the initial number of peptides
from 172665 to 79714 for further analysis. A total of 37,237 peptides (18533 from the
COVID-19 group and 18704 from the control group) yielded group-specific differences
(p<0.05) in signal intensity. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) demonstrated the capacity
of these peptides to separate samples collected from patients with COVID-19 and
controls (Figure 1-A). For IgM analysis, >10,000 AU filtration step reduced the initial
number of peptides from 172665 to 24728 for further analysis. A total of 10,816
peptides (7144 from the COVID-19 group and 3672 from the control group) peptides
yielded group-specific differences (p<0.05) in signal intensity. Multidimensional scaling
(MDS) efforts did not separate samples collected from patients with COVID-19 and
controls (Supplementary Figure 1). However, the presence of three continuous peptides
that were reactive in samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects (irrespective of
disease status) but not in control groups, allowed the identification of 16 SARS-CoV-2
