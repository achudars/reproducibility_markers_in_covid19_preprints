Abstract
Background
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is among the most dangerous infectious diseases that
have emerged in recent history. Human CoV strains discovered during previous
SARS outbreaks have been hypothesized to pass from bats to humans using
intermediate hosts, e.g. civets for SARS-CoV and camels for MERS-CoV. The
discovery of an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 and the identification of
specific mechanism of its emergence in humans are topics of primary
evolutionary importance. In this study we investigate the evolutionary patterns of
11 main genes of SARS-CoV-2. Previous studies suggested that the genome of
SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to the horseshoe bat coronavirus RaTG13 for most
of the genes and to some Malayan pangolin coronavirus (CoV) strains for the
receptor binding (RB) domain of the spike protein.
Results
We provide a detailed list of statistically significant horizontal gene transfer and
recombination events (both intergenic and intragenic) inferred for each of 11 main

genes of the SARS-Cov-2 genome. Our analysis reveals that two continuous
regions of genes S and N of SARS-CoV-2 may result from intragenic
recombination between RaTG13 and Guangdong (GD) Pangolin CoVs.
Statistically significant gene transfer-recombination events between RaTG13 and
GD Pangolin CoV have been identified in region [1215-1425] of gene S and
region [534-727] of gene N. Moreover, some significant recombination events
between the ancestors of SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, GD Pangolin CoV and bat CoV
ZC45-ZXC21 coronaviruses have been identified in genes ORF1ab, S, ORF3a,
ORF7a, ORF8 and N. Furthermore, topology-based clustering of gene trees
inferred for 25 CoV organisms revealed a three-way evolution of coronavirus
genes, with gene phylogenies of ORF1ab, S and N forming the first cluster, gene
phylogenies of ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF8 forming the
second cluster, and phylogeny of gene ORF10 forming the third cluster.
Conclusions
The results of our horizontal gene transfer and recombination analysis suggest
that SARS-Cov-2 could not only be a chimera resulting from recombination of
the bat RaTG13 and Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses but also a close relative
of the bat CoV ZC45 and ZXC21 strains. They also indicate that a GD pangolin
may be an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.

Background
The recent outbreak of a serious pneumonia disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2
(i.e. COVID-19) pathogen has highlighted the danger of coronavirus spread
between different zoonotic sources. Some important transfers of genetic
information across species have been observed during the first SARS outbreak,

involving species from various wet markets in China (Xu et al. 2004). Several
recent studies have suggested that the only close relative of SARS-CoV-2 is the
RaTG13 CoV found in Rhinolophus affinis (horseshoe bats) (Guo et al. 2020;
Zhou et al. 2020). Thus, these bats could be considered as the main natural
reservoir of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. However, recent analyses
of the SARS-CoV-2 genome conducted by Lu et al. (2020) and Lam et al. (2020)
have indicated its high resemblance in certain regions with different coronavirus
genomes of Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica). Zhang et al. (2020) have
reported that the SARS-CoV-2 genome is 91.02% identical to that of a
Guangdong (GD) Pangolin CoV (virus found in dead Malayan pangolins in the
Guangdong province of China; Liu et al. 2019). While at the whole-genome level
RaTG13 remains the closest to SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus organism overall (these
CoVs share 96% of whole genome identity), the receptor binding (RB) domain of
the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is much more similar to the RB domain of
the GD Pangolin CoV than to that of RaTG13 (Lam et al. 2020; Zhang et al.
2020). Five key amino acid residues taking part in the interaction with human
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are completely identical in SARS-CoV2 and GD Pangolin CoV. However, these amino acids are different in the RB
domain of RaTG13 and the Guangxi (GX) Pangolin CoV (virus found in Malayan
pangolins in the Guangxi province of China). Three possible evolutionary
hypotheses could be advanced to explain this paradigm. According to the first
one, these mutations may have occurred as a consequence of the phenomenon of
parallel evolution, when distinct CoV organisms have undergone similar
mutations, and thus have developed similar traits, in response to common
evolutionary pressure. For example, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 had acquired
the RB domain mutations during adaptation to passage in cell culture, as has been
observed for SARS-CoV (Andersen et al. 2020). The second reasonable
hypothesis is divergent evolution favoring amino acid substitutions in the

RaTG13 lineage, independent of recombination. Thus, GD Pangolin CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 similarity could be the consequence of shared ancestry. According
to the third hypothesis, two or more close relatives of SARS-CoV-2 may have
been affected by some recombination events within a host species. Such a
recombination could result in gene exchange between the CoV genomes. During
this recombination, some whole genes of the donor CoV genome could be
incorporated into the recipient CoV genome either directly (when the orthologous
genes are absent in the recipient) or by supplanting in it the existing orthologous
genes. This constitutes the complete gene transfer model that accounts for the
phenomenon of intergenic recombination (Boc et al. 2010). Moreover, the
recombination process could lead to the formation of mosaic genes through
intragenic recombination of the orthologous genes of the donor and recipient
CoVs. The term mosaic comes from the pattern of interspersed blocks of
sequences with different evolutionary histories. This constitutes the partial gene
transfer model that accounts for the phenomenon of intragenic recombination
(Boc and Makarenkov 2011). These models of reticulate evolution have been
widely studied in the literature since the beginning of this century (Legendre
2000; Makarenkov and Legendre 2000; Koonin et al. 2001; Legendre and
Makarenkov 2002; Mirkin et al. 2003; Makarenkov and Legendre 2004;
Makarenkov et al. 2004; Bruen et al. 2006; Jin et al. 2006; Huson and Bryant
2006; Jin et al. 2007; Glazko et al. 2007; Huson et al. 2010; Glazko et al. 2007;
Arenas 2013; Bapteste et al. 2013; Corel et al. 2016).
In this paper, we provide arguments supporting the third hypothesis of the SARSCoV-2 origin, according to which the SARS-CoV-2 genome is a chimera of the
RaTG13 and GD Pangolin coronaviruses. Such a conclusion is in agreement with
the recent results of Xiao et al. (2020) and Li et al. (2020). Some authors,
however, present evidence that there was not recombination between ancestors of
GD Pangolin CoV and RaTG13, suggesting that the similarity pattern between

their genomes is rather the result of recombination into RaTG13 from some
unknown CoV strains (Boni et al. 2020).
In their study investigating the origins of SARS, Stavrinides and Guttman (2004)
highlighted that the SARS-CoV genome is a mosaic of some mammalian and
avian virus genomes. These authors also pointed out that recombination between
the ancestor viruses of SARS may have happened in the host-determining gene S.
However, the work of Stavrinides and Guttman mainly addresses the deep
evolutionary origins of the entire SARS CoV clade and has been criticized by
some expert in the field (Weiss and Navas-Martin 2005). Hu et al. (2017) have
more recently conducted evolutionary analysis of 11 bat CoV (i.e. SARSr-CoV)
genomes discovered in horseshoe bats in the Yunnan province of China and found
that they share high sequence similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable Nterminal domain and the RB domain of gene S, as well as in some regions of
genes ORF3 and ORF8. Hu et al. also reported that their recombination analysis
provided evidence of frequent recombination events within genes S and ORF8
between these bat CoVs and suggested that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV
may have originated from multiple recombination events between the precursors
of different bat CoVs.
Human CoV strains discovered during previous SARS outbreaks have been often
hypothesized to pass from bats to humans using intermediate hosts (e.g. civets for
SARS-CoV and camels for MERS-CoV) (Graham and Baric 2010), suggesting
that SARS-CoV-2 may have also been transmitted to humans this way. It is worth
noting, however, that some other studies from scientists in the field, such as Ralph
Baric, Zheng-Li Shi and Peter Dazsak, have showed the potential for direct
infection of humans from bat strains. They include both serological studies in
rural China near the caves where these bat viruses circulate as well as in vitro/cell
culture studies indicating the ability of bat isolates to infect human cells directly
(Zhengli 2020). Nevertheless, the discovery of such an intermediate host of

SARS-CoV-2, if it existed, is key, as it could shed light on the evolution of this
dangerous virus.
At the same time, it is also crucial to retrace the evolution of all genes of the
SARS-CoV-2 genome, doing it on a gene-by-gene basis. Evolutionary patterns of
various genes of SARS-CoV-2 could be quite different as some of them could be
affected by specific horizontal gene transfer and recombination events. These
events could witness that the SARS-CoV-2 genome is a mosaic genome obtained
via recombination of various virus strains. Our findings suggest that the SARSCoV-2 genome may be in fact formed via recombination of genomes close to the
RaTG13 and GD Pangolin CoV genomes, and be a close relative of bat CoV
ZC45 and ZXC21.

Results
In this section, we present a detailed analysis of putative gene transfer and
recombination events that were detected in each of 11 genes of SARS-CoV-2 as
well as in the RB domain of the spike protein.
SimPlot similarity analysis
Our SimPlot analysis (Fig. 1a) conducted with 25 CoV genomes (see the Methods
section for a detailed data description) shows that the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 and
RaTG13 genomes share 96.14% of whole-genome identity, while the Wuhan
SARS-CoV-2 and GD Pangolin genomes are 90.34% identical. The RaTG13 and
GD Pangolin CoV genomes are by far the closest ones to the SARS-CoV-2
genome. For example, only 85.43% of whole-genome identity is shared between
the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 and GX Pangolin CoV genomes. Given such a close
resemblance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, bat is a likely reservoir of
origin for SARS-CoV-2, as was the case during previous CoV outbreaks.

Then, we performed a detailed similarity analysis at the level of individual genes
to compare the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 gene sequences with the RaTG13, GD
Pangolin CoV group sequences and Bat CoVZ group sequences (Fig. 2). Our
gene-by-gene analysis revealed some regions where SARS-CoV-2 was more
similar to GD Pangolin CoV than to RaTG13. These regions have been found in
genes S (at the RB domain level), ORF3a, M, ORF7a and N, suggesting that some
recombination events between GD Pangolin CoV and RaTG13 may have
occurred not only in gene S (as it has been reported in previous studied; see Lam
et al. 2020 and Zhang et al. 2020), but in four other genes of these CoV genomes.
We also found that in some continuous gene regions, specifically in genes
ORF1ab, ORF3a, M and N, the SARS-CoV-2 gene sequences are much more
similar to those of the bat CoV ZC45 and ZXC21 viruses than to those of the GD
Pangolin CoVs, and sometimes even of RaTG13 (Fig. 2).
Φ-test recombination analysis
We conducted gene-by-gene Φ-test recombination analysis (Bruen et al. 2006) to
further investigate eventual recent recombination events which may have
occurred between orthologous gene sequences of the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2,
RaTG13, GD Pangolin 1 CoV, GD Pangolin P2S CoV, bat CoV ZC45 and bat
CoV ZXC21 viruses. The Φ-test was carried out with different sliding window
sizes, varying from 50 to 400 (with a step of 50), and the window progress step of
1 as the window size can affect the test outcome. The results presented in Table 1
are reported for the window size corresponding to the smallest p-value found for a
given gene. The p-values lower than or equal to the 0.05 threshold were
considered as significant. They indicate the presence of recombination in the gene
under study.
According to the Φ-test (see Table 1), statistically significant recombination
events involving these six coronaviruses have been detected in genes ORF1ab, S,

ORF3a, ORF7a, ORF8, N and in the whole genome sequences. It is worth noting
that recombination events in genes ORF1ab, S and ORF3a were detected with
high confidence, with p-values of 0.0023, 0.0086 and 0.0000113, respectively.
Horizontal gene transfer and recombination analyses
In addition to the SimPlot similarity and the Φ-test recombination analyses, we
also inferred the whole genome phylogeny (Fig. 1b) and all individual gene trees
for the main 11 CoV genes (Figs. 3a-k) as well as for the RB domain of the spike
protein (Fig. 3l and Fig. 4a) using the RAxML method (Stamatakis 2006) with
bootstrapping, and then conducted a detailed horizontal gene transferrecombination analysis (Fig. 3) using the HGT-Detection program available on
the T-Rex web server (Boc et al. 2012). It is worth noting that the presentation of
the whole genome tree could be a bit confusing in our context, as the central
premise of this work is that the evolution of coronavirus organisms is driven by
the gene transfer and recombination mechanisms, but it remains necessary and
serves as a support tree topology to represent the available species groups (Fig.
1b) as well as the detected gene transfer and recombination events (Figs. 3 and 4).
The HGT-Detection program allows one to infer all possible horizontal gene
transfer events for a given group of species by reconciling the species tree (i.e.
whole genome tree in our case) with different gene phylogenies built for whole
individual genes or some of their regions (Denamur et al. 2000; Boc and
Makarenkov 2011). The bootstrap support of the inferred gene transfers was also
assessed by HGT-Detection. It is worth noting that the bootstrap support of
horizontal gene transfer events (HGT) is usually lower than that of the related
branches of the species and gene phylogenies. For example, in order to get an
HGT bootstrap support of 100%, gene transfer from cluster C1 to cluster C2 in
the species tree must be present in all gene transfer scenarios inferred from all
replicated multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) used in bootstrapping, and

clusters C1 and C2 must be neighbor clusters in all gene trees inferred from
replicated MSAs (Boc et al. 2010).
Importantly, each detected horizontal gene transfer event can be interpreted in
three ways: (1) It can represent a unique complete or partial HGT event involving
distant species, as discussed above; (2) it can represent the phenomenon of
parallel evolution, which the involved species might have undergone; and (3) it
can also represent the situation where a new species (i.e. a gene transfer recipient)
was created by recombination of the donor species genome with the genome of a
recipient neighbor in the species phylogeny (this was potentially the case of the
gene transfers from GD Pangolin CoV to SARS-CoV-2, which is a neighbor of
RaTG13 in the species phylogeny, found for genes S and N; see our gene-by-gene
analysis below).
We will now discuss the evolution of the main 11 CoV genes as well as that of the
RB domain of the spike protein with emphasis on the specific horizontal gene
transfer and recombination events detected for each of them.
Evolution of gene ORF1ab
Gene ORF1ab occupies more than two thirds of coronavirus genomes. It encodes
the replicase polyprotein, being translated from ORF1a (11826 to 13425 nt) and
ORF1b (7983 to 8157 nt) (Woo et al. 2010), and plays an important role in virus
pathogenesis (Graham et al. 2008).
The bootstrap support of the branches of the ORF1ab gene phylogeny is commonly
very high, except for the branch connecting the clusters of GD and GX Pangolin
CoVs (Fig. 3a). For this gene, we found a horizontal gene transfer-recombination
event between the ancestors of the clusters of the Bat CoVZ organisms and the
cluster including the RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. This event concerns a half
of this long gene, occurring in gene region [1-11630] with bootstrap support of
61.5% (as this transfer does not affect the whole gene sequence, it is called a partial

HGT). A transfer of the whole ORF1ab gene (i.e. a complete HGT) from the bat
RF1 CoV to bat BtCoV 279 2005 has been detected with bootstrap score of 84.6%.
The transfer between the cluster of the bat BTKY72 and BM48 31 BGR 2008
coronaviruses and the cluster involving SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13 and GD Pangolin
CoVs has been detected on gene region [16326-17626] with bootstrap support of
61.5%. Finally, a deep phylogeny transfer from CoV organisms from the bottom
part of the tree (i.e. SARS-like 2003-2013 viruses) to the cluster of GX Pangolins
CoVs has been found in a relatively short region [1249-1421] with a high bootstrap
score of 97.9%.
Evolution of gene S
Gene S is among the most important coronavirus genes since it regulates the ability
of the virus to overcome species barriers and allows interspecies transmission from
animals to humans (Zhang et al. 2006). S proteins are responsible for the “spikes”
present on the surface of coronaviruses, giving this virus family a specific crownlike appearance. These proteins are type I membrane glycoproteins with signal
peptides used for receptor binding (Woo et al. 2010). They play a crucial role in
viral attachment, fusion and entry, being a target for development of antibodies,
entry inhibitors and vaccines (Tai et al. 2020).
As shown on the SimPlot diagram (Fig. 1a and Fig. 2), this gene has the most
variable sequences among all genes of coronavirus genomes. The bootstrap scores
of internal branches of the phylogeny of gene S are all very high (Fig. 3b). For this
gene, a partial gene transfer was found in region [1-881] between the Bat CoVZ
group and the cluster of GD Pangolin CoVs with bootstrap support of 64.4%.
Another partial transfer from GD Pangolin CoVs to SARS-CoV-2 was found on
the interval [1215-1425] with bootstrap score of 59.7%. This transfer corresponds
to the RB domain. Partial transfers were detected from RaTG13 to GX Pangolin
CoVs in regions [1311-1361] and [1511-1561] with an average bootstrap score of
10

61.5%. Finally, another partial transfer was found between the bat CoVZ group and
the cluster including BtCoV 273 2005, Rf1, HKU3-12, HKU3-6 and BtCoV 279
2005.
Evolution of gene ORF3a
The protein 3a is unique to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. It is essential for disease
pathogenesis. In SARS-related CoVs, it forms a transmembrane homotetramer
complex with ion channel function and modulates virus release (Lu et al. 2006).
The sequences of ORF3a are as highly variable, almost as those of gene S. The
bootstrap scores of the ORF3a gene tree (Fig. 3c) are usually high, except for that
of the branch connecting the cluster of GD Pangolin CoVs and the cluster of
RatTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 (71%), and the branch connecting clusters of some old
CoVs at the bottom part of the tree.
For this gene, a full gene transfer was found between the cluster of SARS-CoV-2,
RaTG13 and GD Pangolin CoVs, and the group of Bat CoVZ viruses, with
statistical significance of 80.8%. A partial gene transfer was detected between the
lower part of the tree (i.e. SARS-like 2003-2013 viruses), excluding bat viruses
from Kenya and Bulgaria (i.e. BtKY72 and BM48 31 BGR 2008), and the GX
Pangolin CoVs in region [251-371] with bootstrap support of 61.5%. The
remaining identified transfers were a deep phylogeny transfer and two transfers
between CoVs from the previous SARS outbreak.
Evolution of gene E
This gene is among the shortest in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. The protein E is a
small transmembrane protein associated with the envelope of coronaviruses. It is
well conserved among all CoVs (Fig. 3d). Gene E is usually not a good target for
phylogenetic analysis because of its short sequence length (Woo et al. 2010). The
bootstrap scores of its gene phylogeny (Fig. 3d) are mostly mediocre. A single gene

transfer-recombination event has been found for this gene. It affects region [71171] and involves CoVs from the previous SARS outbreak.
Evolution of gene M
This gene is particularly important since it is responsible for assembly of new virus
particles (Kandeel et al. 2020). Bootstrap scores of the gene tree are on average
much lower than those of genes ORF1ab, S and ORF3a (Fig. 3e).
Here, we detected two partial gene transfers involving the viruses of the Bat CoVZ
group and affecting: (1) the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 CoVs in region [251-461]
with bootstrap support of 53.9%, and (2) the GD Pangolin CoVs in region [569669] with bootstrap support of 50%. Moreover, a complete gene transfer from
Rs367 to the cluster of Rf1 and BtCoV 273 2005 was found for this gene with
bootstrap score of 92.3%.
Evolution of gene ORF6
Gene ORF6 impacts the expression of transgenes (Mortiboys et al. 2015). The gene
phylogeny of ORF6 (Fig. 3f) has multiple internal branches with low bootstrap
support. For this gene, we found a complete gene transfer between the Bat CoVZ
group and the cluster including SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 with bootstrap support
of 69.2%. Furthermore, a partial gene transfer between HKU3-12 CoV and the
SARS-CoV cluster in region [111-185] with bootstrap score of 67.7% was also
found for this gene.
Evolution of genes ORF7a and ORF7b
The proteins encoded by coronavirus genes ORF7a and 7b have been
demonstrated to have proapoptotic activity when expressed from cDNA
(Schaecher et al. 2007). The phylogenies of these short genes are very unresolved
(Figs. 3g and 3h). A gene transfer-recombination event found for ORF7b involves
CoVs from the lower part of the tree, excluding CoVs of Kenyan and Bulgarian

bats, and the GX Pangolin CoVs. It occurred in region [21-131] with bootstrap
score of 53.8%. Interestingly, a transfer affecting the bat CoVs related to the
previous SARS outbreak was found in both of these genes.
Evolution of gene ORF8
It has been recently shown that the SARS-CoV-2 viral protein encoded from gene
ORF8 shares the least homology with SARS-CoV among all the viral proteins,
and that it can directly interact with MHC-I molecules, significantly
downregulating their surface expression on various cell types (Zhang et al. 2020).
The gene phylogeny of ORF8 has several internal branches with low bootstrap
scores (Fig. 3i). It has been established that ORF8 protein of SARS-CoV has been
acquired through recombination from SARS-related coronaviruses from greater
horseshoe bats (Lau et al. 2015). A complete gene transfer was found for this
gene between the cluster of SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13 and GX Pangolin CoVs and
the bat CoVZ group with bootstrap support of 84.6%. The other detected transfers
concerned the viruses of the SARS-CoV group.
Evolution of gene N
The nucleocapsid protein (N) is one of the most important structural components
of SARS-related coronaviruses. The primary function of this protein is to
encapsulate the viral genome. It is involved in the formation of the
ribonucleoprotein through interaction with the viral RNA (Kandeel et al. 2020).
Several studies report that the protein N interferes with different cellular pathways,
thus being a crucial regulatory component of the virus as well (Surjit et al. 2008).
The phylogeny of gene N (Fig. 3j) is usually well resolved, except for two clusters
in the SARS-CoV part of the tree with bootstrap scores of 64% and 45%. Our
SimPlot analysis showed that the SARS-CoV-2 gene sequence of gene N is almost
as similar to the RatTG13 gene sequence as it is to the GD Pangolin gene sequence.

Precisely, for gene N, the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 and RatTG13 viruses share 96.9%
of the whole-gene identity, while the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 and GD Pangolin CoV
gene sequences are 96.19% identical.
Three statistically significant gene transfer-recombination events have been
detected for this gene. The most interesting of them is the partial gene transfer from
the cluster of GD Pangolin CoVs towards the cluster of SARS-CoV-2 found in
region [534-727] with bootstrap support of 58.6%. Another partial transfer,
between RaTG13 and GD Pangolin CoVs, was detected in region [756-864] with
bootstrap support of 53.8%. Finally, a partial transfer between the cluster
containing the BtCoV 273 2005 and Rf1 viruses and the cluster of HKU CoVs was
found in region [551-721] with bootstrap score of 61.0%.
Evolution of gene ORF10
The protein ORF10 of SARS-CoV-2 includes 38-amino acids and its function is
unknown (Yoshimoto 2020). The phylogeny of this short gene is not well resolved
(Fig. 3k) with several internal branches having bootstrap support under 50%. The
only complete gene transfer-recombination event detected for this gene affects the
Bat CoVZ virus group and the cluster of SARS-CoV-2, RatTG13 and GD Pangolin
CoVs. Its bootstrap score is 79.5%.
Evolution of the RB domain
We carried out an independent analysis of the main evolutionary events
characterizing the RB domain of the spike protein because of its major evolutionary
importance. The S protein mediates the entry of the virus into the cells of the host
species by binding to a host receptor through the RB domain located in its S1
subunit, and then merging the viral and host membranes in the S2 subunit. As
SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also recognizes ACE2 as its host receptor binding to the
S protein of the virus. Thus, the RB domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is the

most important target for the development of virus attachment inhibitors and
vaccines (Tai et al. 2020).
We first studied the evolution of the RB domain for the 25 original organisms that
are strongly phylogenetically related to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The RB
domain amino acid phylogeny (Fig. 3l) commonly exhibits high bootstrap scores
of its internal branches, except for the root branch of the cluster of GD Pangolin
CoVs (56%), the branch separating RatTG13 from the cluster of SARS-CoV-2 and
GD Pangolin CoVs (57%), and the branch separating the cluster of GX Pangolin
CoVs from the cluster including the SARS-CoV-2, GD Pangolin CoV and
RatTG13 viruses (62%). Thus, the location of both pangolin clusters and that of
RatTG13 are the most uncertain in this tree.
Our similarity analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 and RatTG13 share 89.47% of
the whole-gene identity, while the SARS-CoV-2 and GD Pangolin CoV RB domain
amino acid sequences are 97.36% identical. Consequently, some exchange of
genetic material between the clusters of GD Pangolin CoVs and SARS-CoV-2
would be expected here. In fact, a gene transfer from GD Pangolin CoVs to SARSCoV-2 was detected in region [131-186] with bootstrap support of 57.7%. Another
transfer found for this tree was that from the cluster containing BtCoV 273 2005,
Rf1, HKU3-12, HKU3-6 and BtCoV 279 2005 to GX Pangolin CoVs in region [41141] with bootstrap support of 65.4%.
Moreover, we also inferred an extended version of the RB domain tree, adding to
it 21 coronavirus organisms (Fig. 4a) labeled as common cold CoV in the Gisaid
coronavirus tree (Shu and McCauley 2017) and other coronavirus organisms
available in GenBank (Prabakaran al. 2006). These additional CoVs include Human
betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 (i.e. MERS-CoV S), Human coronavirus (i.e.
HKU1 and its isolates N1 and N2), Human coronavirus OC43 and Human enteric
coronavirus strain 4408. This extended analysis allowed us to discover some
additional intergenic and intragenic gene transfer-recombination events involving

human-related coronaviruses, including the exchange of genetic material between:
(1) Murine CoVs and HKU1-related viruses, i.e. a complete gene transfer detected
with high bootstrap score of 88.5%, and a partial transfer detected with bootstrap
score of 59.8%; (2) Equine CoV and the cluster including Human OC43 and Enteric
CoVs, i.e. a partial gene transfer with bootstrap score of 63.5%; (3) Rabbit HKU14
CoV and the cluster including the Enteric human CoV, and the three bovine CoVs,
i.e. a partial gene transfer with bootstrap score of 65.4%; (4) Human OC43 CoV
and Bovine OH440 CoV, i.e. a partial gene transfer with bootstrap score of 57.7%;
and (5) Human Enteric CoV and Bovine AH187 CoV, i.e. a partial gene transfer
with bootstrap score of 84.6%. Interestingly, no any gene transfer-recombination
event between the viruses of the upper part of the species tree, containing SARSrelated coronaviruses (Fig. 4b), and the lower part of this tree, containing MERSrelated, HKU1-related, OC43 CoV-related and Enteric CoV-related viruses, has
been detected.
Analysis of intergenic recombination in 46-species phylogeny
We also carried out an analysis of intergenic (complete gene transfers)
recombination events in the 46-species phylogeny discussed in the previous
section. This extended analysis allowed us to discover some additional gene
transfer-recombination events that affected the lower part of this larger phylogeny
(see Fig. 5), including the 25 SARS-CoV-2-related viruses from Fig. 1b as well as
MERS-CoV, HKU1 coronavirus strains, Human coronavirus OC43, Human enteric
coronavirus, and different Bat, Rat Parker, Murine, Feline, Equine, Bovine, Porcine
and Rabbit coronavirus strains. The analysis was conducted using the HGTDetection program (Boc et al. 2010) available on the T-Rex web server (Boc et al.
2010). The transfers of the higher part of the tree presented in Figure 5 are the

complete gene transfers from Figure 3. The most significant transfers found for the
lower part of the tree include those between: (1) Murine JHM and Rat Parker

coronaviruses found for gene N (bootstrap score of 55.4%); (2) Feline CoV and the
ancestor of the cluster comprising Porcine, Human OC43, Human enteric and three
Bovine CoVs for gene N2 (bootstrap score of 72.3%); (3) Rabbit CoV and the
ancestor of the cluster comprising Human OC43, Human enteric and three Bovine
CoVs for gene S (bootstrap score of 58.4%); and, finally, (4) an interesting
complete transfer affecting the cluster of MERS-CoV S and two of its close
relatives, i.e. bat coronaviruses HKU-4 and HKU-5, for gene ORF3a (bootstrap
score of 76.4%). Gene transfer accounting for this recombination event most likely
stems from an external source (a CoV organism which is absent in the tree). It is
marked by a green arrow in Figure 5. It is worth noting that no intergenic
recombination events between coronaviruses from the higher and lower parts of the
extended CoV species phylogeny tree were found.
Cluster analysis of CoV gene phylogenies
Finally, we also carried out the CoV gene tree clustering to identify genes
following similar evolutionary patterns (i.e. similar gene tree topologies). This
analysis was performed using the k-means-based tree clustering algorithm
adapted for clustering phylogenies with different numbers of leaves (Tahiri et al.
2018) as some gene trees contained less than 25 species (see the Methods
section). Our results indicate that coronavirus genes followed three different
patterns of evolution as the phylogenies of 11 CoV genes and that of the RB
domain of the spike protein were partitioned into 3 disjoint clusters. Figure 6
presents the consensus trees of the detected tree clusters. The first of them (Fig.
6a) obtained using the Consense program from the Phylip package (Felsenstein
1993) is the extended majority rule consensus tree of the gene phylogenies of
ORF1ab, S, RB domain of S and N. The supertree inferred by CLANN (Creeve
and McInerney 2005) (in this case we could not use Consense since the species
BM48_31_BGR_2008 and BtKY72 were missing in the gene phylogeny of

ORF8 is shown in Fig. 6b. The consensus tree of the third cluster, containing a
unique representative - gene tree of ORF10, is its RAxML gene phylogeny (Fig.

Discussion
Recombination is a prevalent process contributing to diversity of most viruses,
including SARS-CoV-2 and other betacoronavirus organisms. It allows viruses to
overcome selective pressure and adapt to new hosts and environments (PérezLosada et al. 2015). In this work, we conducted thorough gene-by-gene horizontal
gene transfer and recombination analysis of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses. Even
though gene borders are not always a natural demarcation of regions where
recombination might occur, e.g. two large portions of gene ORF1ab exhibit
different evolutionary histories, the performed sliding window analysis allowed
us to treat each considered genetic segment as an independent gene region having
its own evolutionary history. We first performed a comparative analysis of four
strains of SARS-CoV-2 with 21 close members of the SARS-CoV family, which
revealed multiple horizontal gene transfer and recombination events between
these coronavirus organisms. The most striking of them were statistically
significant gene transfers from Guangdong Pangolin CoV to SARS-CoV-2 found
in gene S (i.e. this transfer most likely accounts for a putative recombination
event between Guangdong Pangolin CoV and RatTG13 in the RB domain region
of the spike protein) and gene N (i.e. this transfer most likely accounts for a
putative recombination event between Guangdong Pangolin CoV and RatTG13 in
region [534-727] of this gene). These findings are in support of the hypothesis
that SARS-CoV-2 genome is a chimera resulting from recombination of the
RatTG13 and Guangdong Pangolin CoV genomes. According to some recent
studies, the discovery of SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses from pangolins with

similar RB domain, provides the most parsimonious explanation of how SARSCoV-2 could acquire it via recombination or mutation (Anderson et al. 2020; Xiao
et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020). The fact that the highlighted gene transferrecombination events were detected only between Guangdong Pangolin CoV and
SARS-CoV-2, but not between Guangxi Pangolin CoV and SARS-CoV-2, is
another argument in favor of a mosaic recombinant origin of the SARS-CoV-2
genome, and against the parallel evolution paradigm. The confirmed
recombination events in genes S and N (Fig. 3b and j) as well as the SimPlot
recombination analysis of genes S, ORF3a, M, ORF 7a and N (Fig. 2) suggest
that Guangdong pangolin is a likely intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, on its way
of transmission from bats to humans. The bat RatTG13 virus strain could infect a
Guangdong pangolin, which was already a bearer of its own CoV virus, probably
similar to that found in Guangxi pangolins. The two CoV genomes could then
recombine and the resulting recombinant evolve into a SARS-CoV-2 mosaic
strain which was transmitted to humans. Furthermore, we also discovered
multiple gene exchanges between the cluster including the bat CoVZC45 and
CoVZXC21 viruses, and the cluster including the SARS-CoV-2 strains and
RatTG13. Some statistically significant gene transfer-recombination events
between these CoV clusters were found in 6 of 11 coronavirus genes, namely in
ORF1ab, ORF3a, M, ORF6, ORF8 and ORF10 (according to the gene transferrecombination analysis conducted with HGT-Detection; see Fig. 3), and in genes
ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, ORF7a, ORF8 and N (according to recombination analysis
conducted with Φ-test; see Table 1). These findings confirm that not only the
RatTG13 and GD Pangolin CoVs have influenced the evolution of SARS-CoV-2,
but also the bat CoVZC45 and CoVZXC21 coronaviruses or their common
ancestor.
The intergenic recombination analysis of the extended 46-species coronavirus
phylogeny allowed us to detect eight additional statistically significant gene

transfer events affecting the lower part of the tree. Among them, we need to
highlight a complete gene transfer affecting the cluster of MERS-CoV S and two
bat coronaviruses (HKU-4 and HKU-5), stemming from an external source, which
was found for gene ORF3a (see Fig. 5). No recombination events between
coronaviruses from the higher and lower parts of the extended CoV phylogeny were
found (see Figs. 4b and 5). This finding suggests that the gene transferrecombination history of coronaviruses from the SARS-Cov-2 cluster (common
cold CoVs from the higher part of the extended 46-species phylogeny) and that of
coronaviruses from the cluster including MERS-related, HKU1-related, OC43related and Enteric-related CoVs (lower part of the extended 46-species phylogeny)
can be studied separately.
It is worth noting that we have also tried to add to our data set some extra SARSCoV-2 genomes (in addition to the four originally considered SARS-CoV-2
genomes from Wuhan in China, Italy, Australia and USA), but realized that it did
not lead to discovery of any further gene transfer-recombination event in which
these extra SARS-CoV-2 organisms could be involved. This happens because of a
very high sequence similarity between the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes. For
example, the root genomes of the two main SARS-CoV-2 lineages, A and B
(according to a recent SARS-CoV-2 sequence classification proposed by Rambaut
et al. 2020), share 99.89% of whole genome identity (we measured it between the
following

coronavirus

organisms:

Lineage_A_EPI_ISL_406801

and

Lineage_B_MN908947.3; see Rambaut et al. 2020 for more details), while the
Hu_Wuhan_2020 and Hu_Australia_VIC231_2020 SARS-CoV-2 genomes
analyzed in our work share 99.98% of whole genome identity. The difference
between the existing SARS-Cov-2 genomes can be mainly explained by the
presence of particular sets of mutations, with respect to the root sequence (Rambaut
et al. 2020). These mutations are few in numbers and are usually not contiguous.
They can be detected by a simple genome comparison, and do not necessitate the

use of horizontal gene transfer and recombination detection methods. It should be
mentioned that when extra SARS-CoV-2 genomes were added to the 46
betacoronavirus organisms analyzed in our work, they were always involved into
the same gene transfer-recombination events as the four originally considered
SARS-CoV-2 genomes.
We also conducted a cluster analysis of the coronavirus gene trees in order to
identify genes with similar evolutionary histories. This analysis revealed the
presence of three clusters of gene phylogenies: the first cluster includes the
phylogenies of genes ORF1ab, S, RB domain and N, the second cluster includes
the phylogenies of genes ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF8, and
the third cluster contains only the phylogeny of gene ORF10. For example, the
phylogenies of genes S and N, whose evolution was affected by the highlighted
recombination events between Guangdong Pangolin CoV and RatTG13, were
assigned to the same cluster.

Conclusions
The main finding of our work is a detailed list of statistically significant
horizontal gene transfer and recombination events inferred for 11 main genes and
the RB domain of the spike protein of SARS-Cov-2 and related betacoronavirus
genomes (see Figs. 3, 4 and 5). The main advantages of the conducted gene
transfer and recombination analysis, compared to other recent works in the field
(Lam et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020; Boni et al. 2020), is that it allowed us not
only to identify genes and genomes that have been affected by recombination, but
also to determine the donor and recipient organisms for each detected
recombination event, to find out whether this event was intergenic or intragenic,
and to assess its statistical significance via a bootstrap score. Our detailed
horizontal gene transfer and recombination analysis was conducted for each of 11
main genes of the SARS-Cov-2 genome, involving 46 betacoronavirus organisms.

The obtained results (see Figs. 1 to 5) suggest that SARS-Cov-2 could not only be
a chimera resulting from recombination of the bat RaTG13 and Guangdong
pangolin coronaviruses but also a close relative of the bat CoV ZC45 and ZXC21
virus strains. They also indicate that a Guangdong pangolin may be an
intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 prior to its transmission to humans.
Furthermore, our topology-based clustering analysis of coronavirus gene trees
revealed a three-way evolution of SARS-CoV-2 genes (see Fig. 6).
It is worth mentioning that some incongruencies among horizontal gene transfer
and recombination detection methods may exist when applied to the same data
(Becq et al. 2010). In this work, we used three different methods for detecting
gene transfer and recombination events (Φ-test recombination analysis of Bruen
et al. 2006, intergenic HGT analysis of Boc et al. 2010, and both intergenic and
intragenic HGT analysis of Boc and Makarenkov 2011) to study the evolution
SARS-CoV-2 and related betacoronaviruses. While the method of horizontal gene
transfer analysis of Boc et al. (2010) is based on the comparison of the species
and gene tree topologies, that of Boc and Makarenkov (2011) conducts a sliding
window analysis of aligned gene sequences. Both of them make part of a
phylogenetic approach. In the future, it would be interesting to validate our
horizontal gene transfer and recombination results using composition-based
("parametric") horizontal gene transfer detection methods (Ravenhall et al. 2015).

operation in the Guangdong province of China) and five Guangxi Pangolin CoV
genomes (obtained from the Beijing Institute of Microbiology and
Epidemiology). We also included in our analysis the RaTG13 bat CoV genome
from Rhinolophus affinis from the Yunnan province of China, along with the
cluster of two Bat CoVZ organisms, comprising the bat CoV ZC45 and ZXC21
viruses, collected in the Zhejiang province of China in 2018 and five bat CoV
genomes sampled in bats across multiple provinces of China from 2006 to 2010
(denoted as BtCoV 273 2005, Rf1, HKU3-12, HKU3-6 and BtCoV 279 2005 in
the whole genome CoV phylogeny, see Fig. 1b). Finally, we also considered the
SARS-CoV-related genomes from the first SARS outbreak (i.e. human SARS,
Tor2, SARS-CoV BJ182-4 CoVs and bat Rs3367 CoV found in Rhinolophus
sinicus) and two CoV strains coming from bats found in Kenya and Bulgaria
(BtKY72 and BM48 31 BGR 2008). Most of these CoV genomes have been
originally considered by Lam et al. (2020). Moreover, for an extended analysis of
putative gene transfer-recombination events affecting the RB domain of the spike
protein and intergenic recombination events (complete gene transfers) affecting
all the genes under study, we considered 21 additional coronavirus organisms,
including viruses labeled as common cold CoVs in the Gisaid coronavirus tree
(Shu and McCauley, 2017) and other CoV organisms studied by Prabakaran et al.
(2006; they are available in GenBank (Benson et al. 2012) at:

Supplementary Material reports full organism names, host species and GenBank
or Gisaid accession numbers for all CoV genomes analyzed in this study.
We first carried out the SimPlot (Lole et al. 1999) similarity analysis of
coronaviruses most closely related to SARS-CoV-2, comparing the Wuhan
SARS-CoV-2 reference genome to a consensus genomes of five CoV groups (GD
Pangolin CoVs, GX Pangolin CoVs, RaTG13, Bat CoVZ and Bat SL-CoV; see
Fig. 1a). The GD Pangolin group in our analysis consisted of two Guangdong

Pangolin CoVs available in Gisaid (GD Pangolin 1 and GD Pangolin P2S in Fig.
1b). This explains differences in the results of our SimPlot similarity analysis with
the results of Lam et al. (2020), who considered only the first of these GD
Pangolin CoVs in their SimPlot analysis. To avoid possible inconsistency and
program crashes during the SimPlot similarity analysis (Lole et al. 1999), Φ-test
recombination analysis (Bruen et al. 2006) and horizontal gene transfer detection
(Boc et al. 2011), we replaced missing nucleotides in the low-coverage regions of
the GD Pangolin P2S CoV genome by the corresponding nucleotides of the GD
Pangolin 1 CoV genome. This allowed us to better highlight intersections
between the GD Pangolin CoV group similarity curve and the RaTG13 similarity
curve (see Figs. 1a and Fig. 2), which may indicate the presence of gene transferrecombination events between the GD Pangolin and RaTG13 coronaviruses.
Multiple sequence alignments for all gene and genome CoV sequences (in the
Fasta format) used in this study as well as all inferred phylogenetic trees (in the
Newick format) are available at:

Methods details
The VGAS (Viral Genome Annotation System) tool (Zhang et al. 2019), designed
to identify automatically viral genes and perform gene function annotation, was
used to validate all CoV genes extracted from GenBank and Gisaid. Multiple
sequence alignments for 11 CoV genes of the 25 original, and then 46 (for an
extended analysis), betacoronavirus organisms (nucleotide sequences), and for the
RB domain of the spike (S) protein (amino acids), were carried out using the
MUSCLE algorithm (Edgar 2004) with default parameters of the MegaX package
(version 10.1.7) (Kumar et al. 2018). These alignments were used to infer gene
trees presented in Figs. 3 and 4 (left part of each portion of the figure). The whole

analysis), betacoronavirus organisms were aligned in MegaX using the same
version of MUSCLE. The whole genome alignments were used to infer species
trees (see Figs. 1b and 4b). The alignment accuracy for all gene and genome
alignments was verified manually base by base. The GBlocks tool (version 0.91b;
Castresana 2000) from the Phylogeny.fr web server (Dereeper et al. 2008) was
used to eliminate sites with large proportions of gaps. The less stringent
correction option of GBlocks was used.
The maximum likelihood (ML) gene and genome phylogenies were inferred using
the RAxML algorithm (version v0.9.0; Stamatakis 2006). Each tree was
constructed under the best-fit DNA/amino acid substitution model found using
MegaX, and available in RAxML, for the corresponding multiple sequence
alignment. The best available substitution model for genes ORF1ab, S, N and the
whole genomes was (GTR+G+I), for genes ORF3a, E, ORF6, ORF7a it was
(HKY+G), for gene ORF7b it was (HKY+I), for gene ORF8 it was (HKY+G+I),
for gene ORF10 it was (JC), and for the RB domain it was (WAG+G) (see
Supplementary Table 2). In each case, the bootstrap scores of internal branches of
all phylogenies were calculated using 100 bootstrap replicates. All gene and
genome trees were originally drawn in MegaX.
The Partial HGT-Detection program (Boc and Makarenkov 2011) from the T-Rex
web server (Boc et al. 2012) was used to infer directional horizontal gene
transfer-recombination networks for 11 CoV genes and the RB domain of the
spike protein (see Figs. 3 and 4b). Rooted ML genome tree of 25, and then 46,
CoV organisms, playing the role of the species tree, and multiple sequence
alignments (for 11 CoV genes and the RB domain of the spike protein) provided
by MUSCLE, were used as input parameters of the Partial HGT-Detection and
HGT-Detection programs (Boc et al. 2010; for the extended analysis of intergenic
recombination events). The PhyML algorithm (Guindon et al. 2005) with 100
bootstrap replicates was carried out to infer trees from different gene regions for

each position of the sliding window used in Partial HGT-Detection. This
algorithm was carried out separately with sliding window sizes of 10, 25, 50 and
100 sites as well as with the whole sequence alignments (to infer gene transfers of
whole genes). The sliding window advancement sizes (i.e. step sizes) of 1 (for
short genes) and 10 (for long genes and whole genomes) sites was used in our
analysis. Gene transfer-recombination events with bootstrap support of at least
50% identified by Partial HGT-Detection (see Figs. 3 - right portion of each
panel, and 4b), and at least 40% identified by HGT-Detection (see Fig. 5), were
represented by mapping them into the species tree. Some of these transfers may in
fact be explained by the paradigm of parallel evolution when species sharing
similar environment undergo similar mutations and develop similar traits.
SimPlot v3.5. (Lole et al. 1999) was used to carry out a sliding window analysis
and determine patterns of sequence similarity using as reference the Wuhan
SARS-CoV-2 2020 genome. This genome was compared to the RatTG13 genome
as well as to the consensus genomes of the Guangdong Pangolin CoV group,
Guangxi Pangolin CoV group, Bat CoVZ group and Bat SL-VoC group (see Fig.
1a). These consensus genomes were the default consensus genomes generated by
SimPlot v3.5 in order to represent a group of species. In addition, gene-by-gene
SimPlot similarity analysis was performed to compare the genes of the Wuhan
SARS-CoV-2 2020 reference genome with those of the RatTG13, Guangdong
Pangolin CoV and Bat CoVZ group genomes (Fig. 2).
The Φ-recombination test (Bruen et al. 2006) was performed to detect
recombination patterns among individual genes and whole genome sequences of
the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, GD Pangolin 1 CoV, GD Pangolin P2S CoV,
CoV ZC45 and CoV ZXC21 viruses (see Table 1). The Φ-test was conducted
with sliding windows of sizes 50 to 400 (with a step of 50) and the window
progress step of 1. The version of the Φ-test used in our study was that provided

Tree clustering (Fig. 6) was carried out using the k-means-based tree clustering
algorithm adapted for clustering trees with different numbers of leaves (Tahiri et
al. 2018) because some gene trees contained less than 25 species. The latest
version of the tree clustering program was used (it is available at:
https://github.com/TahiriNadia/KMeansSuperTreeClustering). The program was
run with the following options - Tree clustering method: k-means; cluster
validation index: Calinski-Harabasz; penalization parameter  = 0; Tree distance:
Robinson and Foulds topological distance (not squared; Makarenkov and Leclerc
1996; Leclerc and Makarenkov 1998, Makarenkov and Leclerc 2000). The only
difference with the default parameters of the program was that we set the
penalization parameter  to 0 because 11 out 12 trees contained a full set of 25
species.
For the first cluster of trees (i.e. trees of genes ORF1ab, S, RB domain of S, and
N) inferred for the full list of 25 species, the Consense program of the Phylip
package (Felsenstein 1993) was used to infer the extended majority-rule
consensus tree. As the sequences of BM48_31_BGR_2008 and BtKY72 were
missing in the multiple sequence alignment of gene ORF8, we applied a supertree
reconstruction method to retrace consensus evolutionary patterns for the cluster of
genes ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF8. The CLANN program
(Creevey and McInerney 2005) was used with the best heuristic search (hs) and
bootstrap options with 100 replicates to infer a supertree for these genes. The
consensus tree of the third cluster, containing the only tree of ORF10, is the
ORF10 gene tree inferred with RAxML.

Figure legends

Figure 1. Genome similarity and phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses: (a)
SimPlot sliding window analysis of changing patterns of sequence similarity between: the
Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 2020 reference genome with the RatTG13 CoV genome (green) and the
consensus genomes of the GD Pangolin CoV (red), GX Pangolin CoV (orange), Bat CoVZ (violet)
and Bat SL-VoC (gray) groups. Gene limits for genes ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a,
ORF7b, ORF8, N and ORF10, as well as for the RB domain, are shown at the top of the figure.
Different groups of sequences merged in SimPlot analysis are represented by different colors
corresponding to species clusters in the whole genome phylogeny shown in panel (b) of the figure;
(b) Whole genome phylogeny of 25 SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-related organisms. Species
clusters are indicated on the right. Bootstrap scores are indicated on the internal branches of the tree.
Branches with bootstrap score lower than 60% were collapsed. The tree was inferred using the
RAxML method with the most suitable for these data, the HKY-gamma evolutionary model, and 100
replicates in bootstrapping.
Figure 2. Gene-by-gene SimPlot similarity analysis performed to compare gene sequences of the
Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 2020 reference genome with those of the RatTG13 genome (green), GD
Pangolin CoV consensus genome (red) and Bat CoVZ consensus genome (violet). Graphs are shown
for genes ORF1ab, S, ORF3a, M, ORF7a and N that encompass the most important overlaps between
the RaTG13, GD Pangolin CoV and Bat CoVZ similarity curves.
Figure 3. Putative horizontal gene transfer events found for the main 11 genes and the RB domain of
25 SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-related viruses. Left part of each portion of the figure shows the
gene tree, while its right part shows the species tree (i.e. whole genome tree) into which statistically
significant horizontal gene transfers are mapped. Full lines represent complete gene transfers (i.e.
when a complete copy of the donor’s gene is incorporated into the recipient genome; this accounts
for intergenic recombination) and dashed lines represent partial gene transfers (i.e. when a mosaic
gene is formed by recombination of two homologous gene sequences; this accounts for intragenic
recombination). Numbers on the internal branches represent their bootstrap scores. Transfer
directions are represented by arrows (when the direction is not certain, the arrow is bidirectional).
Gene fragments transferred from the donor organism are indicated between brackets and followed by
the transfer bootstrap score calculated by the Partial HGT-Detection program (Boc and Makarenkov,
2011).
Figure 4. Putative horizontal gene transfer events found for the RB domain (amino acid sequences)
of 46 betacoronavirus organisms (extended version of Fig. 3i). Left part of the figure presents the
gene tree of the RB domain. Right part of the figure presents the species tree (i.e. whole genome tree)
with putative horizontal gene transfers mapped into it. The explanations of the caption of Fig. 3 also
apply for this figure.
Figure 5. Putative complete horizontal gene transfer events (accounting for intergenic
recombination) found for the main 11 genes of 46 betacoronavirus organisms from Fig. 4. The
detected complete horizontal gene transfers are mapped into the species tree (i.e. whole genome tree).
Numbers on the internal tree branches represent their bootstrap scores. Transfer directions are
represented by arrows (when the direction is not certain, the arrow is bidirectional). Transfer
bootstrap scores calculated by the HGT-Detection program (Boc et al. 2010) and the associated gene
names are indicated on arrows.

Figure 6. Three consensus trees showing the three ways of evolution of the SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2-related genes. Tree clustering was carried out using the k-means-based tree partitioning
algorithm adapted for clustering trees with different numbers of leaves. The first tree is the extended
majority-rule consensus tree inferred for the phylogenies of genes ORF1ab, S, RB domain of S and
N, forming Cluster 1. This consensus tree was obtained using the Consense program from the Phylip
package. The second tree is the best heuristic search (hs) CLANN supertree inferred for the
phylogenies of genes ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF8 (these gene phylogenies had
different numbers of leaves), forming Cluster 2. The consensus tree of gene ORF10 is its RAxML
tree, which was unique in Cluster 3. Bootstrap scores are indicated on the internal tree branches.
Branches with bootstrap support lower than 40% were collapsed.
