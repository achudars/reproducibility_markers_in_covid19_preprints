Abstract

42

Accumulating mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein can increase the

43

possibility of immune escape, challenging the present COVID-19 prophylaxis and

44

clinical interventions. Here, 3 receptor binding domain (RBD) specific monoclonal

45

antibodies (mAbs), 58G6, 510A5 and 13G9, with high neutralizing potency blocking

46

authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus displayed remarkable efficacy against authentic B.1.351

47

virus. Each of these 3 mAbs in combination with one neutralizing Ab recognizing

48

non-competing epitope exhibited synergistic effect against authentic SARS-CoV-2

49

virus. Surprisingly, structural analysis revealed that 58G6 and 13G9, encoded by the

50

IGHV1-58 and the IGKV3-20 germline genes, both recognized the steric region

51

S470-495 on the RBD, overlapping the E484K mutation presented in B.1.351. Also,

52

58G6 directly bound to another region S450-458 in the RBD. Significantly, 58G6 and

53

510A5 both demonstrated prophylactic efficacy against authentic SARS-CoV-2 and

54

B.1.351 viruses in the transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 (hACE2), protecting

55

weight loss and reducing virus loads. These 2 ultrapotent neutralizing Abs can be

56

promising candidates to fulfill the urgent needs for the prolonged COVID-19

57

pandemic.

Introduction

60

The persistence of COVID-19 in the global population can result in the accumulation

61

of specific mutations of SARS-CoV-2 with increased infectivity and/or reduced

62

susceptibility to neutralization1-12. Highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants, such

63

as B.1.351 emerged in South Africa, harbor multiple immune escape mutations, and

64

have raised global concerns for the efficacy of available interventions and for

65

re-infection2-9,11. As these challenges presented, the protective efficacy of current

66

antibody-based countermeasures needs to be thoroughly assessed against the current

67

mutational variants.

68

The major interest of neutralizing therapies has been targeted towards SARS-CoV-2

69

RBD, which is the core region for the host cell receptor ACE2 engagement13-23.

70

B.1.351 bears 3 mutations, SK417N, SE484K and SN501Y, in its RBD, the first 2 of which

71

have been proven to be the cause for its evasion from neutralizing Ab and serum

72

responses2-9. Nevertheless, a small group of SARS-CoV-2 RBD specific neutralizing

73

Abs demonstrated undisturbed in vitro potency against B.1.3512,4-7,9. Evaluating their

74

therapeutic efficacy against the circulating strains is necessary for the reformulation of

75

protective interventions and vaccines against the evolving pandemic.

76

Here, we focused on 20 neutralizing Abs selected from a SARS-CoV-2 RBD

77

specific mAb reservoir and confirmed their potency against authentic SARS-CoV-2

78

virus. Excitingly, at least 3 of our mAbs showed remarkable neutralizing efficacy

79

against authentic B.1.351 virus. 58G6, one of our top neutralizing Abs, was found to

80

target a region of S450-458 and a steric site S470-495 on the receptor binding motif (RBM).

81

Furthermore, ultrapotent 58G6 and 510A5 exhibited strong prophylactic efficacy in

82

SARS-CoV-2- and B.1.351-infected hACE2-transgenic mice. Our study has

83

characterized a pair of neutralizing Abs with potential effective therapeutic value in

84

clinical applications, which may provide updated information for RBD specific mAbs

85

against the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic.

Results

88

SARS-CoV-2 RBD specific neutralizing Abs exhibited sustained efficacy against

89

authentic B.1.351

90

By our recently established rapid neutralizing Abs screening system24, we have

91

successfully obtained 20 neutralizing Abs with high affinities to SARS-CoV-2 RBD

92

from COVID-19 convalescent individuals, and their neutralizing potencies were

93

confirmed by the half inhibition concentrations (IC50s) against authentic SARS-CoV-2

94

virus quantified via qRT-PCR (Fig. 1a, c and Extended Data Fig. 1). Here, we

95

analyzed the neutralizing potency of our top 10 neutralizing Abs against authentic

96

SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.351 viruses by the plaque-reduction neutralization testing

97

(PRNT). At least 3 of our potent neutralizing Abs 58G6, 510A5 and 13G9 exhibited

98

striking neutralizing efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, with the IC50s value ranging from

99

1.285 to 9.174 ng/mL (Fig. 1b, c). Importantly, the RBD escape mutations of B.1.351

100

did not compromise the neutralizing efficacy of 58G6 and 510A5, with the IC50s of

101

1.660 and 2.235 ng/ml respectively (Fig. 1b, c). As reported for a wide range of RBD

102

specific neutralizing Abs2-9, authentic B.1.351 virus has challenged some of the tested

103

mAbs (Fig. 1b, c). However, majority of our top 10 mAbs still exhibited neutralizing

104

capabilities against this variant (Fig. 1b, c). Of note, the neutralizing potencies of all

105

10 mAbs against the B.1.1.7 pseudovirus were shown to be similar to those against

106

the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 2). In addition, the

107

binding affinity of 58G6 to the B.1.351 S1 subunit was comparable to that to the

108

SARS-CoV-2 S1, while 510A5 and 13G9 showed higher binding affinity to the S1

109

subunit of SARS-CoV-2 than that of B.1.351 (Extended Data Fig. 3). Majority of

110

these top 20 neutralizing Abs exhibited no cross-reactivity to the SARS-CoV S

111

protein or the MARS-CoV S protein (Extended Data Fig. 4). Collectively, 3 RBD

112

specific mAbs demonstrated potent neutralizing efficacy against authentic

113

SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.351 viruses, suggesting that our neutralizing Abs might be

114

applied for the current COVID-19 pandemic.

115

116

The epitopes for potent neutralizing Abs overlapped a key site on SARS-CoV-2

117

RBD

118

To define potential antigenic sites on SARS-CoV-2 RBD, we performed competitive

119

ELISA with the above top 20 neutralizing Abs and the other 54 mAbs selected from

120

our developed RBD-specific mAb reservoir. As shown in Fig. 2a, 5 groups of mAbs

121

were identified according to their recognition sites, each of which consisted of mAbs

122

competing for the epitope for 13G9 (13G9e), the epitope recognized by a

123

non-neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 specific mAb 81A11 (81A11e), or the epitope

124

recognized by a SARS-CoV specific neutralizing Ab CR3022 (CR3022e) (Fig. 2a).

125

Interestingly, the epitopes recognized by the majority of potent neutralizing Abs

126

overlapped with 13G9e (Fig. 2a). Next, we confirmed that the top 20 mAbs could

127

directly inhibit the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 by the competitive

128

ELISA and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay (Extended Data Fig. 5 and 6). To

129

assess the interrelationships between the epitopes recognized by our top 20

130

neutralizing Abs in detail, we performed competitive ELISA using biotinylated mAbs.

131

We found that 16 of them competed with 13G9, whereas the antigenic sites of the

132

other 4 Abs (510A5, 55A8, 57F7 and 07C1) overlapped with an independent epitope

133

(510A5e) (Extended Data Fig. 7). These findings suggest that there are at least 2

134

independent epitopes on the RBD related to SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, from which

135

13G9e may represent a key antigenic site for the binding of potent neutralizing Abs to

136

the RBD.

137

To test whether our mAbs could elicit synergistic effect against SARS-CoV-2, we

138

paired each of the top 3 neutralizing Abs (58G6, 510A5 or 13G9) with one Ab

139

exhibiting much lower potency from another group shown in Fig 2a. Synergistic

140

effects were observed for all combinations at higher levels of inhibition against the

141

authentic virus, confirming the synergistic advantage of neutralizing Ab cocktails (Fig.

142

2b-d). Of note, adding neutralizing Ab from a different cluster barely reduced the
7

143

IC50s of the top 3 mAbs, indicating that our potent mAbs alone were sufficient in

144

neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2b-d).

145

146

58G6 recognized a linear binding region in the denatured RBD

147

To determine the precise interactive regions of our potent neutralizing Abs, first, we

148

assessed the binding ability of the top 20 mAbs to the denatured RBD. In a

149

preliminary screening, 9 mAbs from our top 20 mAbs to SARS-CoV-2 RBD were

150

found to be capable of directly binding to the denatured RBD (Extended Data Fig. 8).

151

Therefore, we designed and synthesized fifteen 20-mer peptides (RBD1 to RBD15),

152

overlapping with 5 amino acids, to cover the entire sequence of the RBD, as amino

153

acids 319-541 of SARS-CoV-2 S (S319-541) (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Unexpectedly,

154

instead of a continuous linear region, we found that 5 of these 9 mAbs could

155

simultaneously recognize 3 independent fragments (RBD2, RBD9 and RBD13), while

156

58G6 only strongly bound to RBD9 (S439-459) (Extended Data Fig. 9b, c). To

157

determine the essential amino acid residues in the RBD accounted for 58G6 binding,

158

we re-synthesized two 20-mer peptides overlapping with 15 amino acids (RBD9-1

159

and RBD9-2), covering the RBD9 specific residues (Extended Data Fig. 9a). The

160

results of peptide ELISA revealed that 58G6 preferentially interacted with RBD9-1

161

than RBD9, in a dose-dependent manner, whereas no interaction of 58G6 with

162

RBD9-2 was observed (Fig. 3a, b). When we individually replaced each amino acid

163

residue in RBD9-1 (S444-463) with alanine (A), we found that the binding of 58G6 to a
8

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.19.440481; this version posted April 20, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

164

fragment of 8 amino acids (S450-457) was significantly reduced (Fig. 3a). To a lesser

165

extent, S445-449 and S458-463 also slightly affected the binding of 58G6, and the former

166

might explain for the abolished interaction of 58G6 with RBD9-2 (Fig. 3a). Moreover,

167

we found that RBD9-1 bound to ACE2 in a dose-dependent manner, which could be

168

competitively inhibited by 58G6 (Fig. 3c-e). And the region of S445-463 was identified

169

to be critical for the RBD9-1-ACE2 interaction (Fig. 3c, d). Hence, S445-463 represents

170

an important region of SARS-CoV-2 RBD for the recognition of neutralizing Abs

171

represented by 58G6. It is worth mentioning that the interaction of 510A5 or 13G9

172

with the denatured RBD was not observed (Extended Data Fig. 8). Taken together, we

173

evidenced a linear region in the denatured RBD (S450-457) that could be recognized by

174

58G6, which was one of the ultrapotent neutralizing Abs against authentic

175

SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.351 viruses.

176

177

58G6 and 13G9 encoded by the IGHV1-58 and IGKV3-20 germline genes both

178

recognized the steric region of S470-495 on the RBD

179

To further investigate the molecular mechanism of our neutralizing Abs against

180

SARS-CoV-2, we determined the single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)

181

structures of the antigen binding fragments (Fabs) of 58G6 or 13G9 in complex with

182

the modified SARS-CoV-2 S trimer with stabilizing mutations25 (Extended Data Fig.

183

10a, b). We refined these two complex structures to the overall resolution of 3.6 Å for

184

58G6 and 3.9 Å for 13G9, respectively (Fig. 4a, b, Extended Data Fig. 10c-j and
9

185

Extended Data Table. 1). For either the 58G6 or the 13G9 complex, the

186

three-dimensional classification of the cryo-EM data showed the presence of a

187

dominant conformational state of S trimers in complex with the Fabs, with the

188

majority of selected particle images representing a 3-Fab-per-trimer complex (Fig. 4a,

189

b). As shown in Fig. 4a, in individual complex, each 58G6 Fab interacted with one

190

RBD in the “up” state. Similar to the structure of the 58G6 Fab-S complex, only one

191

dominant particle class was observed for the 13G9 Fab-S complex, corresponding to a

192

3-Fab-bound complex with all 3 RBDs in the “up” conformation (Fig. 4b).

193

Further refinement of the variable domains of 58G6 or 13G9 and the RBD to 3.5 Å

194

or 3.8 Å, respectively, revealed detailed molecular interactions within their binding

195

interface (Extended Data Fig. 10c-f, g-j). These two refined density maps along with

196

the predicted structures of the 58G6 and 13G9 Fabs were used to build the models to

197

illustrate detailed amino acid structures in three dimensions (Extended Data Fig. 11)26.

198

Superimposition of the RBDs in the structures of 58G6 Fab-RBD and ACE2-RBD

199

complexes indicates a steric clash between ACE2 and the variable domains on the

200

heavy chain (HC) and the light chain (LC) of 58G6 Fab (Fig. 4c). Such observations

201

indicate that 58G6 can competitively inhibit the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2

202

RBD and ACE2. Likewise, an almost identical steric clash between 13G9 Fab and

203

ACE2 was observed, indicating that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 interaction can be

204

prohibited by 13G9 (Fig. 4c). When we compared the details of binding interface of

205

these 2 mAbs and RBD, they showed high level of structural similarity (Fig. 4d).

206

Specifically, majority of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs; CDRH2,
10

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.19.440481; this version posted April 20, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

207

CDRH3, CDRL1 and CDRL3) of 58G6 Fab directly participate in the interaction with

208

the steric region of S470-495 (Fig. 5a). Meanwhile, 13G9 Fab was shown to recognize

209

the same steric region using its CDRs: CDRH2, CDRH3, CDRL1 and CDRL3 (Fig.

210

5b). In parallel, an additional site of residues 450-458 on SARS-CoV-2 S (S450-458)

211

was observed for 58G6 recognition (Fig. 5b), which contained the linear region of

212

S450-457 we had identified with the denatured RBD, as shown above (Fig. 3a, b).

213

We found that both 58G6 and 13G9 were derived from IGHV1-58 for the heavy

214

chain and IGKV3-20 for the light chain, with a few differences in amino acid

215

constitution of their CDRH1, CDRH3 and CDRL3 (Extended Data Table. 2). These

216

identical germline gene origins correlated with the structural similarity between 58G6

217

and 13G9 (Fig. 4d). Several potential hydrogen bonds were identified on the contact

218

surface of each mAb and RBD, representing the unique network associated with

219

individual CDRs and amino acid residues within the epitope corresponding to each

220

mAb (Fig. 5c, d). In summary, these Fab-S complex structures suggest that 58G6 and

221

13G9 adopt the same potential neutralizing mechanism, wherein they are capable to

222

simultaneously bind to 3 RBDs, occluding the access of SARS-CoV-2 S to ACE2.

223

Notably, N94 in the CDRL3 of 58G6 or R94 in 13G9 forms a hydrogen bond with the

224

carbonyl group on the main chain, rather than the side chain, of SE484 (Fig. 5c, d).

225

Moreover, direct contact with a hydrogen bond was found between T105 in the

226

CDRH3 of 58G6 and K458 in the RBD, but not for S105 in 13G9 (Fig. 5c, d).

228

58G6 and 510A5 showed protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.351 in

229

vivo

230

Given the IC50s of our mAbs 58G6 and 510A5 against authentic B.1.351 were as low

231

as approximately 2 ng/mL in vitro, we tested their prophylactic efficacy in the

232

transgenic animal model. Different groups of hACE2 mice received intraperitoneal

233

administration of these 2 mAbs or PBS 24 hours before an intranasal challenge with

234

authentic SARS-CoV-2 (WIV04) or B.1.351. For the hACE2 mice challenged with

235

SARS-CoV-2 (WIV04), the PBS group showed significant loss of body weight, while

236

those animals from either mAb-treated group retained their body weight for 3 days

237

post-infection (Fig. 6a). When challenged with B.1.351, the hACE2 mice receiving

238

PBS showed gradual weight loss and reached an approximately 30% drop at day 3,

239

whereas the treatment of 58G6 or 510A5 effectively stopped the B.1.351-induced

240

weight reduction (Fig. 6a). Importantly, we found that the viral load of either

241

SARS-CoV-2 or B.1.351 in the lung tissues was significantly decreased with a single

242

dose of either mAb (Fig. 6b). These results indicate that 58G6 and 510A5 can

243

effectively protected hACE2 transgenic mice from infectious SARS-CoV-2 and

244

B.1.351, highlighting their prophylactic potential in the present COVID-19 epidemic.

Africa has been reported to confer resistance to neutralization from multiple available

mAbs, convalescent plasma and vaccinee sera, posting a high re-infection risk2-9. In

251

the present study, we identified 20 neutralizing Abs with high potency against

authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus, from a RBD specific mAb reservoir. Among them,

253

58G6 and 510A5 exhibit high neutralizing capabilities against the authentic virus.

254

Remarkably, these 2 mAbs can efficiently neutralize authentic B.1.351 virus,

255

comparable to most effective neutralizing Abs reported up to date2,5,6,9. Their IC50s

256

against this variant were as low as approximately 2 ng/mL, hence we termed these 2

257

mAbs as ultrapotent neutralizing Abs. Such profound neutralizing potencies were

258

confirmed in vivo where the prophylactic treatment of these 2 mAbs could efficiently

259

protect the transgenic mice carrying hACE2 against the airway exposure of authentic

260

SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.351 viruses. These results put 58G6 and 510A5 at the center

261

stage for the development of clinically effective therapeutic regiments against the

262

current COVID-19 pandemic.

263

In order to understand the high neutralizing potency of our mAbs against

264

SARS-CoV-2, we assessed the antigenic landscape of SARS-CoV-2 RBD. We found

265

that all our RBD targeting mAbs could be categorized into 5 groups according to their

266

recognition on the RBD. Interestingly, the epitopes recognized by the majority of our

267

potent neutralizing Abs overlapped with 13G9e, suggesting that it represented one of

268

the vulnerable sites on SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The other 4 of the top 20 mAbs competed

269

with 510A5 for the binding of RBD at 510A5e. It is worth mentioning that these 2

270

regions may correspond to 2 separate classes of epitopes recognized by the largest

271

numbers of RBD specific neutralizing Abs, as described in recent studies (Extended

272

Data Fig. 7 and 12)18,27.

273

In detail, we identified that 58G6 recognized a region consisted of amino acids

274

450-458 in the RBD. Of note, recent cryo-EM structure analysis has revealed 3 key

275

ACE2-interacting residues (SY453, SL455, and SF456)13,14, indicating that S450-458 may be

276

the critical site taken into consideration for SARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis. we found at

277

least one specific hydrogen bond within this region, between 58G6 and RBD, that

278

may contribute to recognition of the unique linear region by 58G6, rather than 13G9.

279

Although certain steric proximity of 13G9 to S450-458 has been observed, it needs to be

280

pointed out that no specific linear binding sites have been identified for this mAb.

281

Moreover, 13G9 and 58G6 both recognized the steric epitope of S470-495 on the

282

RBD, which was the key region shared by ACE2 and several reported potent

283

neutralizing Abs against SARS-CoV-213,14,22,27. The cryo-EM analysis revealed a

284

hydrogen bond between N94 in 58G6 and the carbonyl group on the main chain,

285

rather than the side chain, of SE484. Common mutation within this region found in

286

current variants, such as SE484K in B.1.351 or P.1 emerged in Brazil9,11, may not have

287

significant impact on the affinity of 58G6 to the RBDs of these variants. Indeed, the

288

sustained affinity of 58G6 to B.1.351 S1 has been confirmed by the SPR, which may

289

explain for the potentially broad neutralizing spectrum of 58G6. However, for 13G9,

290

the SE484K mutation in B.1.351 or P.1 may introduce an additional positive charge

291

around R94 within its CDRL3, which may lead to strong electrostatic repulsions

292

between the two residues. This may explain the decreased affinity of 13G9 to B.1.351,

293

hence the slight decrease of neutralizing potency against this variant. As far as we

294

know, we are the first to report that an ultrapotent neutralizing Ab to SARS-CoV-2

295

with direct contact to SE484K still exhibits exceptional potency against authentic

296

B.1.351 virus.

297

For the potent 13G9 or 58G6, we noted that the RBDs interacting with the 3 Fabs

298

of Abs are universally in the ‘up’ state. As previously described, such full occupancy

299

in each complex could render RBD completely inaccessible for ACE215,18,20,22.

300

However, the significance of this observed phenomena with 3-“up” conformation in

301

all particles of the Fab-S complex, in another word, its correlation to the

302

neutralization advantages, remains unknown.

303

Interestingly, we noted that 13G9 and 58G6, though originally isolated from the

304

samples of different COVID-19 convalescent donors, were both transcribed from

305

IGHV1-58 and IGKV3-20. These 2 variant regions were also genetically responsible

306

for a panel of reported neutralizing Abs with high potency against SARS-CoV-2 as

307

well as B.1.3515,6,21,22,27. These findings highlighted the otherwise overlooked

308

importance for the pairing of the IGHV1-58 and the IGKV3-20 germline genes in

309

neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 and its variant.

310

In conclusion, we present 2 ultrapotent SARS-CoV-2 RBD specific mAbs with

311

exceptional efficacy against B.1.351, for which a significant proportion of reported

312

neutralizing Abs are impaired. Structural analysis of epitopes revealed the potential

313

neutralizing mechanism of neutralizing Abs against B.1.351 carrying the E484K

314

mutation. These broad-spectrum neutralizing Abs could be promising candidates for

The 74 mAbs analyzed in our manuscript were derived from a total of 39 COVID-19

389

convalescent blood samples collected within a 2-month window post discharge. These

390

39 convalescent patients have an average age of 45 years old, and majority of them

exhibited mild symptoms, as described in the previous study24. The original studies to

392

obtain blood samples after written informed consent were previously described and

393

had been approved by the Ethics Board of ChongQing Medical University24. Briefly,

394

we utilized SARS-CoV-2 RBD as bait to sort the antigen-specific memory B cells

395

from the COVID-19 convalescent patients. The IgG heavy and light chains of mAbs

396

genes in these memory B cells were obtained by single cell PCR and transiently

authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus (nCoV-SH01, GenBank: MT121215.1, 100 TCID50) for

414

1 h at 37 °C. After the incubation, the mixtures were then transferred into 96-well

415

plates, which were seeded with Vero E6 cells. The plates were kept at 37 °C for 48 hrs.

416

And the supernatant viral RNA load of each well was quantified by qRT-PCR. For

417

qRT-PCR, the viral RNA was extracted from the collected supernatant using Trizol LS

509

and these particles were used to do Ab-Initio reconstruction in six classes. Then these

510

six classes were used as 3D volume templates for heterogeneous refinement with all

511

selected particles, with 108,020 particles converged into the SARS-CoV-2 S-58G6

512

Fab class. Next, this particle set was used to perform non-uniform refinement,

513

yielding a resolution of 3.56 Å.

514

For the dataset of SARS-CoV-2 S-13G9 Fab complex, a total of 445,137 particles

515

were auto-picked using the template picker and 266,357 raw particles were extracted

516

with a box size of 512 pixels in cryoSPARC. The following 2D, 3D classifications,

517

and refinements were all performed in room temperature (RT). 70,519 particles were

518

selected after two rounds of 2D classification, and these particles were used to do

519

Ab-Initio reconstruction in six classes. Then these 6 classes were used as 3D volume

520

templates for heterogeneous refinement with all selected particles, with 52,880

521

particles converged into the SARS-CoV-2 S-13G9 Fab class. Next, this particle set

522

was used to perform non-uniform refinement, yielding a resolution of 3.92 Å.

523

Although the overall resolution for these structures is up to 3.5 Å - 3.6 Å for 58G6

524

and 3.9 Å - 4.0 Å for 13G9, the maps for the binding interface between RBD and Fabs

525

are quite weak due to the conformational heterogeneity of the RBD, which is similar

526

to previous structural investigations15,18,22,34. To improve the resolution for the binding

527

interface, we subsequently added local refinement processing. A local reconstruction

528

focusing on the RBD-Fabs region was carried out. Furthermore, the density map for

529

the binding interface could be improved further by local averaging of the RBD-Fab

530

equivalent copies, finally yielding a 3.5 Å map of the region corresponding to the

58G6 variable domains and the RBD (Extended Data Fig. 10c, f). Similarly, we

532

improve the local resolution between the 13G9 variable domains and the RBD up to

533

3.8 Å (Extended Fata Fig. 10g, j).

534

Local resolution estimation, filtering, and sharpening were also carried out using

Model Building and Refinement

539

To build the structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S-58G6 Fab and S-13G9 Fab complexes,

540

the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein in complex with the C105

541

neutralizing antibody Fab fragment15 (PDB: 6XCN) was placed and rigid-body fitted

542

into the cryo-EM electron density maps using UCSF Chimera35, respectively. Both of

543

the 58G6 and 13G9 Fab models were first predicted using Phyre226 and then manually

544

built in Coot 0.936 with the guidance of the cryo-EM electron density maps, and

545

overall real-space refinements were performed using Phenix 1.1837. The data

546

validation statistics are shown in Extended Data Table 1.

556

(B.1.351 S1) (Sino Biological, Beijing, China) were prepared (2-fold dilutions, from

557

50 nM to 0.78 nM) with HBS-EP+ Buffer (0.01 M HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.003 M

558

EDTA and 0.05% (v/v) Surfactant P20, pH 7.4), and sequentially injected into the

559

chip and monitored for the binding kinetics. After the final reading, the sensor surface

560

of the chip was regenerated with 3 M MgCl2 (GE) before the measurement of the next

561

mAb. The affinity was calculated with Biacore X100 Evaluation Software

562

(Version:2.0.2) using 1:1 binding fit model.

563

To determine competition with the ACE2 peptidase domain, SARS-CoV-2 RBD

564

was coated on a CM5 sensor chip via amine group for a final RU around 250. The top

565

20 neutralizing Abs (20 μg/mL) were injected onto the chip until binding steady-state

566

was reached. ACE2 (20 μg/mL) was then injected for 60 seconds. Blocking efficacy

567

was determined by comparison of response units with and without prior antibody

568

incubation.

For competitive ELISA used in epitope mapping of mAbs, 2 μg/mL recombinant

571

RBD-his (Sino Biological, Beijing, China) was added in 384-well plates and

572

incubated at 4 °C overnight. 50 μg/mL mAbs per well were added. The plates were

performed using the EZ-link NHS-PEO Solid Phase Biotinylation Kit (Pierce)

576

according to the manufacturer’s protocol and purified using MINI Dialysis Unit

577

(ThermoFisher, 69576). 500 ng/mL biotinylated mAbs were added to each well, and

578

the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. ALP-conjugated streptavidin (Mabtech,

579

Sweden, 3310-10) was added at 1:1000, followed by an incubation of 30 mins at

580

37 °C. For the quantification of bound IgG, PNPP (Thermo Fisher) was added at 1

581

mg/mL and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured by the MultiSkan GO

582

fluoro-microplate reader (Thermo Fisher).

583

Western blot analysis

584

The recombinant RBD protein was mixed with 5 × loading buffer (Beyotime,

585

Shanghai, China) and denatured for 5 mins at 100 °C. The denatured proteins (200 ng)

586

were subjected to electrophoresis with 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then

587

transferred to PVDF membranes. After blocking by skim milk (Biofroxx), the

588

membranes were incubated at 4 °C overnight, with the purified mAbs as primary Abs.

589

The next days, the membranes were washed with TBST and incubated with

590

HRP-conjugated Goat-anti-human Fc antibody (Abcam, ab99759, 1:10000) for 1 h at

591

RT. The membranes were examined on ChemiDoc Imaging System (Bio-rad).

592

Peptide ELISA

593

Peptide ELISA was performed with synthesized peptides overlapping with 5 amino

594

acids (Genescripts, Wuhan, China). These peptides were tethered by N-terminal

595

biotinylated linker peptides (biotin-ahx), except for the first peptide at the N-terminus,

596

whose biotin was linked to the C terminus instead. The RBD9-1 amino acid residues

598

50 μL synthesized peptide was added to the streptavidin-coated 384-well plate in

599

duplets to make a final concentration of 5 μg/mL. The plates were incubated for 2 hrs

600

at RT. After washing, the plates were blocked with Protein-Free Blocking Buffer

601

(Pierce, USA, 37573) at RT for 1 h and incubated with 10 μg/mL testing mAbs at RT

602

for another 1 h. Reacted mAbs were detected using ALP-conjugated Goat F(ab')2

603

Anti-Human IgG (Fab')2 secondary antibody conjugated with ALP (Abcam, ab98532,

604

1:2000) for 30 mins at RT, followed with quantification detection.

605

For the ACE2 competitive peptide ELISA, 5

μg/mL

synthesized RBD9-1 was

606

immobilized on the streptavidin-coated 384-well plate at RT for 2 hrs. After washing

607

with Protein-Free Blocking Buffer, the plates were blocked with this blocking buffer.

608

Next, serial diluted 58G6 (20-0.625 μg/mL) in 50 μL of the blocking buffer were

609

added into plate and the plates were incubated at RT for 1 h. Then, the plate incubated

610

with 2 μg/mL ACE2 at RT for another 1 h. The ELISA plates were washed 4 times by

611

blocking buffer and 50 μL Goat F(ab')2 Anti-Human IgG (Fab')2 secondary antibody

612

conjugated with ALP (Abcam, ab98532, 1:2000) was incubated with the plate at RT

613

for 30 mins. The plate was washed and followed with quantification detection.
