Abstract

2

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, has resulted in

3

hundreds of thousands of deaths. Cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2, which is mediated by

4

the viral spike protein and host ACE2 receptor, is an essential target for the

5

development of vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and drugs. Using a mammalian cell

6

expression system, we generated a recombinant fluorescent protein (Gamillus)-fused

7

SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer (STG) to probe the viral entry process. In ACE2-expressing

8

cells, we found that the STG probe has excellent performance in the live-cell

9

visualization of receptor binding, cellular uptake, and intracellular trafficking of SARS-

10

CoV-2 under virus-free conditions. The new system allows quantitative analyses of the

11

inhibition potentials and detailed influence of COVID-19-convalescent human plasmas,

12

neutralizing antibodies and compounds, providing a versatile tool for high-throughput

13

screening and phenotypic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors. This

14

approach may also be adapted to develop a viral entry visualization system for other

15

viruses.

Introduction
Since previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV-1 in 2002 and MERS-CoV in 2012,
1-4

3

COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has become pandemic

. The

4

development of therapeutic and preventative agents against SARS-CoV-2 infection is

5

urgently needed. Viral cellular entry is the first step for the establishment of a

6

productive viral infection5. Effective inhibition of viral entry is an important goal for the

7

development of antiviral antibodies, vaccines, and drugs

8

CoV-2 is mediated by viral spike (S) glycoprotein and its interaction with the cellular

9

ACE2 receptor

6-8

. The cell entry of SARS-

9-14

. To date, a variety of approaches have been employed to develop

10

prophylactic and therapeutic measures aimed at functional blockage of SARS-CoV-2

11

cell entry 15-19.

12

Current cell-based assays for study SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, using either authentic

13

virus or spike-bearing pseudotyping virus20-22, require biosafety facilities and multistep

14

experimental procedures and are time-consuming, which has greatly limited relevant

15

studies, particularly high-throughput screening studies. With the goal of establishing

16

an ideal system for high-throughput screening of SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors in virus-

17

free conditions and facilitating the development of antibodies and vaccines, we

18

developed a fluorescent SARS-CoV-2 entry probe that can be visualized and

19

quantified via live-cell imaging. Using the novel probe, we established a one-step

20

ultrafast assay for characterization of various SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors. The

21

practical applicability of the new system was systematically evaluated by using human

22

COVID19-convalescent plasmas, immunized mouse sera, monoclonal antibodies

23

(mAbs) and compound inhibitors.

25

Recombinant FP-fused spike proteins of coronaviruses

26

The constructs used to produce the recombinant FP-fused coronavirus spike

27

probes contain the following elements: (i) an N-terminal signal peptide; (ii) a receptor-

28

binding domain (RBD) or the S-ectodomain; (iii) a flexible-linker following green

29

fluorescent protein (GFP); and (iiii) a T4-fibritin foldon (TFd) for trimerization the S-

30

ectodomain (Figure 1A). The Gamillus (mGam) and mNeonGreen (mNG) were tested

31

as the fused-GFP because mGam is acid-tolerant, which may enable fluorescent

32

tracking when the probe is taken up into acidic cellular organelles

33

brightest GFP to our knowledge

34

(mGam-fused) or RBN (mNG-fused) and designated the S-ectodomain trimer (ST)-

35

based probes as STG (mGam-fused) and STN (mNG-fused). We expressed

36

recombinant RBG proteins for the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS, HKU1 and

37

RaTG13 coronaviruses and STG and STN probes for SARS-CoV-2 in CHO cells

23

, and mNG is the

24

(Figure 1B and Figure S1). Non-FP-fused SARS-CoV2-RBD and SARS-CoV2-ST

2

proteins and a nontrimerized mGam-fused S-ectodomain (SARS-CoV2-SMG) were

3

also produced. The molecular weights of the SARS-CoV2-STG and SARS-CoV2-STN

4

were determined to be approximately 808-kd by size-exclusion chromatogram (Figure

5

1C, Figure S2A-B). Furthermore, Cryo-EM reconstructions of the SARS-CoV2-ST

6

(Figure S2C) and SARS-CoV2-STN (Figure S2D) both demonstrated a typical trimeric

7

structure

8

human ACE2 (hACE2) were 18.2 nM and 30.4 nM (Figure 1D), respectively, which

9

were similar to previously reported data for unfused proteins 9, 10. Together, C-terminal

10

FP-fusion does not influence the structure and ACE2-binding capability of the RBD and

11

S-ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2.

12

Establishment of virus-free assays to visualize SARS-CoV-2 cell entry

9, 10

. The binding affinities of SARS-CoV2-STG and SARS-CoV2-RBG to

13

We established hACE2-overexpressing cell lines using the ACE2hR and

14

ACE2iRb3 constructs (Figure 2A). Cell-transfection with ACE2hR allowed hACE2-

15

overexpression with nucleus visualization (H2B-mRuby3). ACE2iRb3 contains an

16

ACE2-mRuby3 expressing cassette following an IRES-ligated H2B-iRFP670-2A-

17

PuroR. Transfection with ACE2iRb3 simultaneously enabled fluorescent visualization

18

of hACE2 (hACE2-mRuby3) and nucleus (H2B-iRFP670). Using these vectors, we

19

developed three stable cell lines, namely, 293T-ACE2iRb3, 293T-ACE2hR and H1299-

20

ACE2hR. As expected, hACE2 (or ACE2-mRuby3) was expressed at high levels, and

21

the expression of TMPRSS2 (another critical factor for viral entry) 12 did not change in

22

these cells (Figure 2B).

23

On 293T-ACE2iRb3 cells, both the SARS-CoV2-RBG and SARS-CoV2-STG

24

probes showed effective-binding to the cells, as membrane-bound and hACE2-

25

mRuby3-colocalized mGam signals were observed after a 6-min incubation with the

26

cells (Figure 2C). Cytoplasmic mGam signals were detected in cells after incubation

27

for 60-min or longer with the probes, particularly for SARS-CoV2-STG, suggesting that

28

the recombinant probes can not only bind to the cell surface but also be taken up into

29

the cells. The internalization of SARS-CoV2-STG was more evident than that of SARS-

30

CoV2-RBG into 293T-ACE2iRb3 (Figure 2C). In live-cell dynamic tracking, more

31

internalized mGam signals was observed for SARS-CoV2-STG than SARS-CoV2-

32

RBG (Figure S3A). For mGam signals, the internalized fluorescence ratio (IFR, Figure

33

S3B) and the internalized vehicle numbers (IVNs, Figure S3D) of STG-treated cells

34

were both significantly higher than those of RBG-treated cells approximately 30-min

35

after probe-cell incubation. In contrast, no significant difference was noted in hACE2-

36

mRuby3 internalization in the presence or absence of probes (Figure S3C).

37

Using 293T-ACE2iRb3 cells, we established a cell-based assay mimicking SARS4 / 27

CoV-2 cell entry based on recombinant probes. It was a one-step wash-free assay

2

(Figure 2D). After 1-hour cell-probe incubation, the cells were directly imaged by using

3

a fully automatic high-content screening (HCS) system in confocal mode. For

4

quantitative measurements, the H2B-iRFP670 were used to identify the nucleus, and

5

the ACE2-mRuby3 were used to determine the cell boundary. Based on the detected

6

nucleus and cell outlines, the green fluorescence intensities on the cell membrane and

7

in the cytoplasmic region of each cell could be measured (Figure 2D). Generally, we

8

used the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in the cytoplasmic region (cMFI) as an

9

index of the amounts of the cell-bound and internalized probes. As the spikes of MRES-

10

CoV and HKU1-CoV do not interact with hACE2, the signals of MERS-RBG and HKU1-

11

RBG on 293T-ACE2iRb3 were nonspecific background (Figure 2E). RaTG13-RBG

12

showed a detectable and dose-dependent cMFI, but the value was significantly lower

13

than those of the probes of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Compared to SARS-

14

CoV1-RBG, SARS-CoV2-RBG showed slightly stronger signals, possibly due to its

15

higher binding affinity. For SARS-CoV-2, the cMFI of SARS-CoV2-STG, SARS-CoV2-

16

STN and SARS-CoV2-ST488 were significantly higher than that of SARS-CoV2-RBG

17

and SARS-CoV2-RBD488, and also stronger than SARS-CoV2-SMG. The dylight488-

18

labeled SARS-CoV2-RBD488 probe presented a weaker signal than SARS-CoV2-

19

RBG, suggesting that the NH2-dye modification at some amino acids of the RBD may

20

interfere with its interaction with hACE2. Moreover, mGam-fused probes showed better

21

performance than dylight488-labeled or mNG-fused probes (Figure 2F). At a

22

concentration below than 10 nM, the cMFI of SARS-CoV2-STG was approximately 10-

23

fold higher than that of SARS-CoV2-RBG.

24

Based on the visualization system, we developed cell-based HCS assays for

25

analyzing the blocking potencies of SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors, designated CSBT

26

(using SARS-CoV2-STG) and CRBT (using SARS-CoV2-STG), respectively. The

27

proteins of hACE2-Fc (rACE2), SARS-CoV2-RBD and SARS-CoV2-S1 were

28

employed for inhibition assessments following the procedure described in Figure 2D.

29

As expected, all three proteins exhibited dose-dependent cMFI inhibition in both

30

assays (Figure 2G). The Z’-factor coefficients of the CSBT and CRBT were both

31

determined to be over 0.7 (Figure S3E), which demonstrated their robustness and

32

reproducibility.

by CSBT and CRBT.

35

Recent studies have suggested that convalescent plasma may be beneficial in

36

COVID-19 treatments 25, 26. Neutralization antibodies (NAbs) in convalescent plasmas

37

may be essential in suppressing viruses

27

. However, a rapid method for determining

1

the neutralization antibody titer (NAT) of human plasma is still absent. We evaluated

2

the feasibility of the CSBT and CRBT determined entry-blocking antibody titers as NAT

3

surrogates in 32 COVID-19-convalescent human plasmas (Table S1). Compared with

4

samples from healthy donors (n=40), all COVID-19-convalescent plasmas showed

5

significant cMFI inhibition on CSBT assay, whereas only 12 samples (37.5%) had

6

detectable CRBT activity (Figure 3A). For quantitative analysis, two-fold serial dilution

7

tests were further performed to determine the CSBT and CRBT titers (Figure 3B).

8

Moreover, the titers of total antibodies (TAb), IgG, IgM, and lentiviral-pseudotyping-

9

particles (LVpp) based NAT (LVppNAT) against SARS-CoV-2 were also measured for

10

comparisons (Figure 3C). Among the antibody titers derived from various assays, the

11

CSBT titer showed the best correlation with LVppNAT (Figure 3D and Table S2,

12

r=0.832, p<0.001), and it also well correlated (r=0.959, p<0.001, Figure 3D) with the

13

neutralization activity against authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus in 12 representative

14

samples (Table S3). Together, the CSBT-determined entry-blocking antibody titer is a

15

good NAb surrogate of convalescent plasmas.

16

Functional phenotyping of mouse anti-spike antibodies by CSBT and CRBT.

17

Serum samples from mice immunized with the SARS-CoV2-RBD, SARS-CoV2-

18

S1 and SARS-CoV2-S2 were collected for LVppNAT, CSBT and CRBT measurements.

19

The SARS-CoV2-RBD and SARS-CoV2-S1 immunizations resulted in potent and

20

comparable serum LVppNAT (Figure S4A), whereas SARS-CoV2-S2 raised little NAbs.

21

The CSBT (Figure S4B) and CRBT (Figure S4C) assays also exhibited similar results

22

to LVppNAT measurements. The ID50 correlation coefficient was 0.989 (p<0.001)

23

between CSBT and LVppNAT and 0.925 (p<0.001) between CRBT and LVppNAT.

24

Using RBD-immunized mice, we developed 18 mAbs via RBD-ELISA screening

25

following cell-based functional evaluations (as illustrated Figure 4A). These mAbs did

26

not display much difference in ELISA-binding to SARS-CoV2-RBD, but 2 of them (8H6

27

and 15A9) showed significantly decreased ELISA-binding activities to SARS-CoV2-ST

28

(Figure S5A). Based on epitope-binning assays using a cross-competitive ELISA, the

29

mAbs could be divided into six groups (Figure S5B). All mAbs showed detectable but

30

varied surface plasmon resonance (SPR) affinity (0.004-131 nM, Figure S6) to SARS-

31

CoV2-RBD. Quantitative measurements of CSBT, CRBT and LVppNAT for the mAbs

32

were further performed (Figure 4B to C, Figure S7A to C). Half of the mAbs exhibited

33

high-to-moderate CSBT blocking potencies (IC50<30 nM), whereas the remaining

34

ones showed low-to-no CSBT activities (Figure 4B). In comparisons of the dose-

35

dependent cMFI inhibitions against SARS-CoV2-STG, SARS-CoV2-ST488, SARS-

36

CoV2-RBG, and SARS-CoV1-RBG (Figure 4C), the profiles of most mAbs against

37

SARS-CoV2-STG and SARS-CoV2-ST488 were similar, but the activities of 2B4 and
6 / 27

1

34B4 were dramatically decreased with SARS-CoV2-ST488 compared to SARS-

2

CoV2-STG, suggesting that dye-conjugation may modify the epitopes of the two mAbs

3

and hinder their bindings. Notably, seven mAbs exhibited striking enhancement at

4

some dosage in the CRBT assays (Figure 4C and Figure S7B), but neither

5

enhancement was noted in the CSBT nor LVppNAT tests. SPR analyses demonstrated

6

that the Fabs of two representative CRBT-enhancing mAbs, 53G2 and 8H6, also

7

showed a dose-dependent promoting effect on the RBD-ACE2 binding, whereas the

8

Fabs of two CRBT-blocking mAbs (36H6 and 2B4) exhibited a dose-dependent

9

reduction in the RBD-ACE2 interaction (Figure S8). Together, the CRBT-enhancing

10

effects of these mAbs may be caused by the antibody-induced RBD conformation

11

changes associated with increases in ACE2-binding capacity.

12

The functional potencies of mAbs determined by various assays are summarized

13

in Figure 4D and Table S4. The CSBT-IC50 values of the mAbs showed the good

14

correlation with their LVppNAT IC90 (r=0.866, p<0.001, Figure 4E) or IC50 (r=0.750,

15

p<0.001, Figure S9) values, and were also well correlated with their CRBT-IC50 values

16

(r=0.869, p<0.001, Figure 4E). However, a 53G2 mAb presented CSBT activity but no

17

inhibition in the CRBT assay, suggesting that its CSBT activity is independent of the

18

direct blocking of the RBD-ACE2 interaction (Figure 4D). An 83H7 mAb with moderate

19

LVppNAT activity but showed neither CSBT nor CRBT inhibition (Figure 4D),

20

suggesting it may act through different mechanisms to achieve neutralization. No

21

significant relationship was noted between the ELISA- or SPR-determined protein-

22

binding activities and neutralization potencies of the mAbs (Figure S9).

23

According to the SPR (Figure S10) and CRBT analyses using SARS-CoV1-RBG

24

(Figure 4C), the 2B4, 34B4, 5F3, 18C5, and 8H6 mAbs showed cross-reactivity to

25

SARS-CoV-1 and RaTG13-CoV. However, only the 2B4 mAb had neutralization activity

26

in SARS-CoV-1 LVppNAT measurements (Figure S7D). Epitope-binning assay (Figure

27

S5B) suggested that 2B4, 34B4, 5F3 and 14D2 possibly share an overlapping-epitope

28

(cluster C2), and 18C5, 8H6, 83H7 and 65G9 may bind to another similar epitope (mAb

29

cluster C5b). As 2B4 showed comparable LVppNAT potencies against both SARS-

30

CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, it may recognize a cross-neutralization epitope. The 36H6

31

mAb, which recognizes a unique epitope that differs from other mAbs (mAb cluster C1,

32

Figure S5B), presented the best performance in LVppNAT, CSBT, and CRBT assays

33

but did not show any cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-1 or RaTG13. Both 36H6 and

34

2B4 have neutralization activities against the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus (Figure

35

S7E), and the 36H6 exhibited superior neutralization activity with an IC50 of 0.079 nM

36

(11.9 ng/mL).

entry visualizing system.

2

The 83H7 mAb showed SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity against both

3

pseudoparticles (IC50=0.99 nM) and the authentic virus (IC50=13.02 nM) but had

4

neither CSBT nor CRBT activity. We speculated that this mAb may inhibit the SARS-

5

CoV-2 via an intracellular neutralization pathway

6

dylight633-labeled mAbs (Ab633) of 36H6, 53G2, 83H7, and 8H6 and an irrelevant

7

mAb (ctrAb) for dual-visualizing tracking. Among them, 36H6, 53G2 and 8H6 served

8

as controls that had strong, moderate and weak/no activity for both CSBT and

9

neutralization, respectively. In 293T-ACE2iRb3 cells simultaneously incubated with

10

STG and Ab633, we performed time-serial live-cell imaging analyses. To characterize

11

the influence of these mAbs on SARS-CoV2-STG internalization, the dynamic changes

12

of the STG-IVNs, the STG-IVpMFI (the peak MFI of internalized vesicles), the Ab633-

13

IVNs, the Ab633-IVpMFI, and the percentage of STG/Ab633-colocalized internalized

14

vesicles, and the STG-IVA were calculated (Figure 5). As expected, 36H6 completely

15

obstructed STG internalization (p<0.001), 53G2 showed significant but incomplete

16

inhibition (p=0.002), and 8H6 presented little/no influence on STG internalization

17

(p=0.70). Compared to ctrAb, the 83H7 showed no significant STG-IVNs reduction

18

(p=0.31, Figure 5A) but increased the STG-IVpMFI (p<0.001, Figure 5B). On the other

19

hand, the 83H7 group exhibited higher Ab633-IVNs (p<0.001, Figure 5C) and Ab633-

20

IVpMFI (p<0.001, Figure 5D). The STG/Ab633 colocalization (p<0.001, Figure 5E) and

21

the STG-IVA (p<0.001, Figure 5F) in the 83H7 group were also significantly higher and

22

larger, respectively, than those in the other groups. Representative images at 5-hour

23

post STG/Ab633-cell incubation, as shown in Figure 5G, further confirmed these

24

findings. These results demonstrated that 83H7 could efficiently enter cells in the

25

presence of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The enlarged internalized STG vesicles in

26

associating with 83H7 suggested that the mAb may induce aggregation and disturb

27

intercellular function of S protein, which may contribute to its neutralization activity.

Visualization of the influence of compounds on SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.

. To validate this, we prepared

29

Previous studies suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into cells via

30

endocytosis. In this study, 11 inhibitors targeting various processes of endocytosis and

31

endosome maturation were evaluated (Figure 6A). In SARS-CoV-2 LVpp infection tests

32

(Figure 6B), the micropinocytosis inhibitor cytochalasin-D (CytD) and the clathrin-

33

dependent endocytosis (CME) inhibitors dynasore and dansylcadaverine (MDC)

34

showed dose-dependent inhibition with high-micromolar IC50 values. In contrast,

35

neither of the caveolae-mediated endocytosis inhibitors nystatin and filipin inhibited

viral infection. These results suggested that micropinocytosis and CME, instead of

caveolae-mediated endocytosis, are involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Moreover,

apilimod, a phosphoinositide 5-kinase (PIKfyve) inhibitor29, showed a low-nanomolar

2

IC50. Similar effects were observed for two other PIKfyve inhibitors (YM201636 and

3

APY0201). The acidification inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (Baf.A1) or the TPC2 inhibitor

4

tetrandrine30 also significantly diminished viral infection.

5

In STG-visualization system, the cMFI measurements following the CSBT

6

procedure showed only a slight reduction in cells treated with a high dose of Amiloride,

7

dynasore, apilimod, and APY0201 (Figure S11A). Notably, confocal-images revealed

8

that the STG, colocalizing with internalized ACE2-mRuby3, were trapped on enlarged

9

cytoplasmic vacuoles induced by PIKfyve inhibitors (Figure 6C), and most of these

10

vacuoles were not stained by pH-dependent LysoView633 dyes, suggesting an

11

abnormal pH-status (Figure S11B). In addition, tetrandrine or Baf.A1 also caused

12

marked reductions in colocalization of internalized STG and LysoView633 stain-signals

13

(Figure S11B), suggested that the two compounds also disturbed STG intracellular

14

trafficking. For quantitative characterizations of the compound-induced influence on

15

STG-internalization, the IVNs, IVA and IFR for cells treated with different

16

concentrations of compounds at 1-hour and 5-hour post probe-loading were calculated.

17

Apparently, compounds with infection-inhibitory effects correspondingly induced IVNs

18

reduction or the increase of IVA or IFR (Figure 6D). The SARS-CoV-2 LVpp infection

19

efficiencies were positively correlated with the IVNs and were negatively correlated

20

with the IVA and IFR parameters (Figure S12). Overall, the 1-hour IVNs showed the

21

best correlation with LVpp infection efficiencies (r=0.870, p<0.001). These results

22

demonstrated the practical applicability of the STG-visualization system to screen and

23

characterize compound inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 cell entry.

Discussion

26

Together, we established a versatile visualization system enables live-cell

27

visualization of cellular binding, uptake, and intracellular trafficking of SARS-CoV-2 in

28

virus-free conditions. The innovative system have several advantages over traditional

29

technology: (i) using a recombinant FP-fused SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as sensor

30

with little influence on the binding to hACE2 (Figure 1D) and minimal destruction of

31

antibody-binding epitopes (Figure 4C); (ii) the acid-tolerant GFP-tag (mGam) enables

32

fluorescent tracking and imaging analysis of dynamic viral entry events, even when it

33

is internalized into acidic organelles (Figure S11B); (iii) the 293T-ACE2iRb3 cells with

34

stably

35

membrane/nucleus definition and quantitative analysis at the single-cell level; (iiii) one-

36

step, wash-free and fast detecting procedure (Figure 2D) provides robust settlement

without biosafety concerns for high-throughput screening of neutralization antibodies

and compound inhibitors.

2

Our data provided convincing evidence demonstrating the versatile applicability of

3

the new system. The CSBT-determined entry-blocking potency was a better correlate

4

of NAT against pseudotyping or the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus than ELISA-binding

5

activity in COVID19-convalescent human plasmas, immunized mouse sera and mAbs.

6

The CSBT may serve as rapid proxy assessment to identify plasma source with

7

therapeutic potential in clinic, and is a useful tool in evaluating vaccine efficacy and

8

neutralizing mAb identification. In this study, 4 of 18 mAbs (36H6, 2B4, 3C8 and 12H8,

9

Figure 4D) with the strongest CSBT blocking activities (IC50<10 nM) showed the most

10

potent LVppNAT (IC90<3 nM). Notably, the 36H6 mAb presented superior

11

neutralization activity against authentic SARS-CoV-2 (IC50=0.079 nM), which was

12

comparable with recently described potent neutralizing mAbs16,

13

providing an excellent candidate for further development of therapeutic COVID-19

14

antibody

15

SARS-CoV-2 and showed binding activity with RaTG13-CoV, suggesting that it

16

recognize a SARS-CoVs shared neutralizing-epitope. Further identification of such

17

epitopes recognized by 2B4-like mAbs may facilitate the development of universal

18

vaccines against SARS-CoV-like viruses 33.

31

, and thereby

32

. The 2B4 mAb has cross-neutralization activity for both SARS-CoV-1 and

19

Antibodies can inhibit viral infection via various mechanisms following the steps of

20

viral cellular entry 34, 35. The CSBT and CRBT assay in combination with neutralization

21

test provide a toolbox to distinguish the acting step of antibody neutralization (Figure

22

5). First, the mAbs (e.g. 36H6) with CRBT activities implying blocking capabilities on

23

initial viral cell-attachment via hindering RBD-hACE2 interaction. Second, mAbs with

24

CSBT but no CRBT activity (e.g. 53G2) may inhibit viral infection at post-attachment

25

endocytic internalization. Third, some mAbs (e.g. 83H7) have neither CRBT nor CSBT

26

effects and may also neutralize viruses via intracellular pathways when they enter cells

27

by binding with viral spikes. It is possible that the intracellular antibody may block

28

conformational changes and/or the requisite interaction between viral spike and host

29

factor for viral-endolysosomal membrane fusion and/or viral genome release 36.

30

Furthermore, we developed STG-based high-content analysis system for studying

31

compound-induced influences on SARS-CoV-2 endocytosis and intracellular

32

trafficking (Figure 6). Our data revealed both CME and micropinocytosis involve in the

33

STG entry process, whereas caveolae-mediated endocytosis plays little role. However,

34

neither the CME nor

35

internalization and LVpp infection alone, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may use

36

multiple mechanisms to gain entry into cells. These findings are consistent with

37

previous studies regarding SARS-CoV-1 cell entry

micropinocytosis

. The profound inhibitory effects

of the acidification inhibitor Baf.A1 on both STG internalization and LVpp infection

2

demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 cell entry is pH-sensitive. In agreement with findings

3

from a recent study, the inhibitors against TPC2 and PIKfyve strongly disturbed cell

4

entry of STG and pseudotyped virus 20, showing potential drug targets for SARS-CoV-

5

2 infection.

6

In summary, we developed a versatile tool for live-cell imaging studies of SARS-

7

CoV-2 cell entry and provided a virus-free high-throughput assay to identify and

8

characterize neutralizing antibodies and compound inhibitors. The new strategy can

9

be adapted to develop visualization systems for studies cell entry of different viruses.

incomplete adjuvant at 2-week later, as previously described. The resulting

6

hybridomas were screened for the secretion of RBD-specific mAbs using an indirect

7

ELISA. The reactive cell clones were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks. Monoclonal cells that

8

produced mAbs were obtained by limiting dilution at least three times. In this study, a

9

total of 18 mAb-producing hybridomas were finally obtained. The mAbs were produced

10

and purified as previously described 44.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blots

12

The titers of TAb, IgG, and IgM against SARS-CoV-2 of human blood samples

13

were detected by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits

14

provided

15

measurements were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The TAb-

16

ELISA kit is based on recombinant viral antigen using a double-sandwich reaction form.

17

The IgG kit is an indirect ELISA assay, and the IgM kit is based on the μ-chain capture

18

method. All three assays used recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD antigens. The samples

19

were initially tested undiluted, and the positive samples with the signal to a cutoff ratio

20

(S/CO) >=10 were further diluted (1:10, 1:100, 1:1,000 and 1:10,000) by PBS buffer

21

containing 20% newborn bovine serum (NBS) and tested again. The titers for TAb, IgG,

22

and IgM antibody were calculated via S/CO multiplied by the maximum dilution factors.

23

To determine the ELISA binding activities of mAb to immobilized SARS-CoV2-

24

RBD and SARS-CoV2-ST (Figure S5A), ELISA plates were coated with viral proteins

25

at 200 ng per well, and nonspecific binding was blocked with phosphate-buffered saline

26

(PBS) that contained 10% NBS, 0.5% casein (Sigma) and 10% sucrose. A series of 3-

27

fold series dilutions that ranged from 10,000 ng/mL to 0.056 ng/mL for each mAb were

28

prepared. For the test, 100 μl of specimens were added to the reaction well and

29

incubated for 60-min at 37°C, followed by washing and reaction with horseradish

30

peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse pAb (Wantai, Beijing, China). After a further

31

30-min incubation, the plates were washed with PBST buffer (20 mM PB7.4, 150 mM

32

NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20) five times. The TMB chromogen solution (100 μL per well)

33

was then added to the wells, and the plates were further incubated for 15-min.

34

Subsequently, the reaction was stopped by adding 50 μL of 2 M H2SO4, and the OD

35

was measured at 450 nm against 630 nm (OD450-630) by a microplate reader.

PBST buffer following the TMB chromogen solution addition. After a 15-min incubation,

5

50 μL of 2 M H2SO4 was added to stop the reaction, and the OD450-630 was measured.

6

The inhibition ratio (%) was quantitatively assessed by comparing OD450-630 obtained

7

with HRP-mAb in the presence or absence of competitor mAbs. A reduction of >70%

8

was considered as an effective inhibition. The mAb clusters were generated based on

13

To visualize compound-induced influence on viral entry, 293T-ACE2iRb3 (Figure

14

6C-D, Figure S11A) or H1299-ACE2hR cells (Figure S11B) were pretreated with serial

15

dilutions of compounds for 1-hour. Then the probes were added to the cell cultures for

16

further incubations in the presence of compounds. Cell images shown in Figure 6C

17

and Figure S11B were acquired on TCS SP8 STED confocal microscope using a 100x

18

oil immersion objective. The data of Figure 6D and Figure S11A were derived from

19

images acquired on Opera Phenix using 40x water immersion objective. For pictures

20

of Figure 6C, the cells were gently washed twice with PBS at 5-hour post STG

21

incubation, following a paraformaldehyde fixation before imaging. For experiments as

22

shown in Figure S11B, the cells at 5-hour post STG incubation were stained with

23

Lysoview633 (0.1 μL per well) for 10-min, then the cells were gently washed twice with

24

PBS buffer and fixed with paraformaldehyde treatment before imaging. Cell images

25

involved in Figure 6D and Figure S11A were acquired in wash-free and live-cell

26

conditions, at different various time points as indicated in their legends.

Quantitative image analyses

28

All quantitative image analyses were based on images acquired by Opera Phenix,

29

following a schematic flow chart shown in Figure 2D. All image data were transfer to

30

Columbus system (version 2.5.0, PerkinElmer Inc) for analysis. Multiparametric image

31

analysis was performed as described in the following. The signals of the blue channel

32

(NucBlue, only for Figure 5) or near-infrared channel (H2BiRFP, for other data) were

33

used to detect the nucleus. As the ACE2 is a membrane protein, the signals of ACE2-

34

mRuby3 (red channel) were used to determine the cell boundary. Then, the cells were

35

further segment into the regions of membrane (outer border: 0%, inner border: 15%),

36

(Ex488/Em525) in the cytoplasmic region (cMFI). The MFI of ACE2-mRuby3

2

(Ex561/Em590) on the membrane were also calculated for inter-well normalization.

3

The cMFI inhibition ratio (%) of the test sample was calculated using the following

4

equation: [(cMFIpc-cMFItst)/(cMFIpc-cMFIblk)]×100%. In this formula, the cMFIpc is the

5

cMFI value of probe-only well (as positive control), the cMFItst is the cMFI value of test

6

well, and the cMFIblk is the cMFI value of cell-only well. For each plate, five replicates

7

of probe-only well and one cell-only well were included. The CSBT and CRBT activities

8

of mAbs were expressed as IC50, and that of blood samples were expressed as ID50.

9

The ID50/IC50 values were determined by 4PL regression GraphPad Prism v8.0. To

10

determine the internalization characteristics, the parameters of IFR, IVNs, IVpMFI, and

11

IVA were measured. Among these parameters, the IFR is the ratio of intensity in the

12

cytoplasmic region and in the whole cell, the IVNs is the average numbers (per cell) of

13

internalized fluorescent vesicles, the IVpMFI is the average peak MFI of internalized

14

fluorescent vesicles, and the IVA is the average area of internalized fluorescent

15

vesicles. The detailed algorithms for the above-mentioned imaging analyses using

16

Columbus system are available from the corresponding authors on request.

17

Statistical analysis

18

The unpaired t-test of variance was used to compare continuous variables. Linear

19

regression models and Pearson correlation tests were used for correlation analyses.

20

Two-way ANOVA tests were used to analysis the time-serial observations for

21

independent variable. Differences were considered significant at a two-tailed p < 0.05.

22

GraphPad Prism version 8.0.1 was used for all statistical calculations.
