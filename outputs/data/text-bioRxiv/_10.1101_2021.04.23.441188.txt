STRUCTURED ABSTRACT
INTRODUCTION
Hyperinflammation is frequently observed in patients with severe COVID-19. Inadequate and
defective IFN type I responses against SARS-CoV-2, caused by autoantibodies in a
proportion of patients, lead to severe courses. In addition, hyperactive responses of the
humoral immune system have been described so far.
RATIONALE
In the current study we investigated a possible role of neutralizing autoantibodies against antiinflammatory mediators. Plasma from patients with severe and critical COVID-19 was
screened by ELISA for antibodies against PGRN, IL-10, IL-18BP, IL-22BP and IL-1-RA.
Autoantibodies were characterized and the antigens were analyzed for immunogenic
alterations.
RESULTS
PGRN-autoantibodies were detected with high titers in 11 of 30 (36.7%), and IL-1-RAautoantibodies in 14 of 30 (46.7%) patients of a discovery cohort with severe to critical
COVID-19. In a validation cohort of 41 patients with critical COVID-19 high-titered PGRNAbs were detected in 12 (29.3%) and IL-1-RA-Abs in 19 of 41 patients (46.2%). PGRN-Abs
and IL-1-RA-Abs belonged to IgM and several IgG subclasses. In separate cohorts with noncritical COVID-19, PGRN-Abs and IL-1-RA-Abs were detected significantly less frequently
and at low titers. Neither PGRN- nor IL-1-RA-Abs were found in 40 healthy controls
vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. PGRN-Abs were not cross-reactive against SARS-CoV-2
structural proteins or against IL-1-RA. Plasma levels of both free PGRN and IL-1-RA were
significantly decreased in autoantibody-positive patients compared to Ab-negative and nonCOVID controls. Functionally, PGRN-Abs from patients reduced PGRN-dependent inhibition
of TNF-α signaling in vitro. The pSer81 hyperphosphorylated PGRN isoform was exclusively
detected

in

patients

with

high-titer

PGRN-Abs;

likewise,

a

yet

unidentified

hyperphosphorylated IL-1-RA isoform was only found in patients with high-titer IL-1-RAAbs. No autoantibodies against IL-10, IL-18BP or IL-22BP were found.

To conclude, neutralizing autoantibodies to IL-1-RA and PGRN occur in a significant
proportion of patients with critical COVID-19, with a concomitant decrease in circulating
PGRN and IL-1-RA, which is indicative of a misdirected, proinflammatory autoimmune
response. The break of self-tolerance is likely caused by atypical isoforms of both antigens
due to hyperphosphorylation. It remains to be determined whether these secondary
modifications are induced by the SARS-CoV-2-infection itself, or are preexisting and
predispose for a critical course.

INTRODUCTION
The disease COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 shows a very wide spectrum of
manifestations and severity ranging from completely asymptomatic infection, to mild cold
symptoms or attenuation of the sense of taste and smell, to acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS) often associated with thromboembolic complications (1),(2),(3),(4).
Patients requiring intensive care treatment often present with a hyperinflammatory state,
which

has

been

compared

with

hemophagocytic

lymphohistiocytosis

(HLH)(5).

Correspondingly, anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive drugs like dexamethasone or
inhibitors of the IL-1ß-, IL-6-, JAK/STAT-, or the BCR-pathways have been studied in
clinical trials (6),(7),(8),(9),(10),(11),(12). Among these drugs, though, only dexamethasone
and IL-6 pathway blockade were so far found to provide a significant clinical benefit, in terms
of a reduced 28-day mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 (6).
Defective IFN I (13),(14),(15) and overactive B-cell responses and autoantibodies against
interferons were detected specifically in patients with severe courses of COVID-19 (16), but
the role of pathogenetically or "self-attacking" antibodies has so far not yet been clearly
established (17). Previously, we had identified neutralizing autoantibodies against progranulin
(PGRN) in sera from patients with primary small vessel vasculitis (18). Subsequently we
found progranulin-Abs in various rheumatic and other autoimmune diseases, but only very
rarely in healthy controls, elderly or obese subjects, ICU patients and patients with melanoma
(19),(20),(21).
PGRN, also called proepithelin, is a secreted precursor protein. Beside several other
biological functions(22), a major property of PGRN is its anti-inflammatory effect (23),(24),
which is mediated by direct binding to TNFR1, TNFR2 and DR3 and thus antagonism of
TNF-α and TL1-a (25),(26). This has been demonstrated in vivo in several mouse models
including collagen and collagen-antibody induced arthritis (25), OXA induced dermatitis (27)
and more relevant for COVID-19 also in LPS-induced lung injury/ARDS mouse models
(28),(29),(30). Both PGRN and TNF-α bind to cysteine-rich domain 2 and 3 (CRD2 and 3) of
TNFR (31). The proinflammatory effect of neutralizing PGRN-antibodies was characterized
in vitro by the analysis of TNF-α-induced cytotoxic effects by MTT-assays and by
downmodulation of FoxP3 in CD4+CD25hi Tregs in inflammatory bowel diseases and
rheumatic diseases (20),(32). Due to hyperinflammatory states and similarities of severe
COVID-19 with vasculitis and autoimmune diseases(4), aim of the current study was to
investigate the possible occurrence of antibodies directed against previously described antiinflammatory antigens as progranulin or IL-10(33), but also against other secreted anti-

inflammatory mediators like IL-1-RA.

RESULTS
Occurrence, titers and IgG subclasses of anti-progranulin and anti-IL-1-RA antibodies
The anti-PGRN ELISA demonstrated the presence of PGRN-autoantibodies in plasma of 11
of 30 patients (11/30; 36.7%) with COVID-19 of the discovery cohort (21 critical, 9 severe
disease) (Fig. 1 A). In controls of non-COVID-19 ICU patients only 1 of 28 patients (3.6%)
had weakly detectable PGRN-antibodies (Fig. 1 B). In autoantibody-positive patients with
severe or critical COVID-19, the titers ranged from 1:1600 up to 1:3200 (Fig. 1 C). PGRNantibodies belonging to the IgM class were found in 10 of 11 patients with COVID-19, and in
all of the 11 PGRN-Ab-positive patients IgG class autoantibodies were found, with IgG1
detectable in 8, IgG2 in 9, IgG3 in 6 and IgG4 in 8 of these (Fig. 1 D).
In a validation cohort of patients with critical COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation, 12
of 41 (29.3%) patients had PGRN-Abs (Supplementary Fig. 1 A). Very similar to the
discovery cohort, the PGRN-Abs often belonged both to the IgM class and simultaneously to
different IgG subclasses and had similar titers (Supplement Fig. 1 B and 1C). Regarding 89
patients with predominantly moderate COVID-19 from the level 1 and 2 centers in the federal
German state of Saarland, PGRN-Abs were only detected in 12 (13.5%) with titers of ≤ 1:400
(Supplementary Fig. 1 E and F). In patients with predominantly mild courses of COVID-19
PGRN-antibodies were detected with low titers in two of 56 (3.5%) convalescent plasma
donors with an asymptomatic to mild course of the CAPSID-trial (supplementary Figure 1 I))
and in 2 of 49 patients (4.1%) with mild courses of COVID-19 obtained from the Institute of
Virology from Saarland Medical Center (Fig. 1 E). If all critically ill patients with COVID-19
at time of blood test and ICU treatment are considered together, 21 of 62 patients (33.9%) had
PGRN-Abs with titers ≥ 1:800, compared to 4 of 37 (1%) with severe and 0 of 69 moderate
and 0 of 93 with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 (Figure 1 F) (two tailed Fisher exact test:
critical and severe compared to moderate and mild: p < 0.0001).
PGRN-Abs were not detected in sera or plasma of 40 healthcare-workers after 2 vaccinations
against SARS-CoV2 (Supplementary Fig. 1 I).
Next, we analyzed autoantibodies against further anti-inflammatory mediators. IL-1-RAantibodies were detected in 14 of 30 patients (46.7%) with severe to critical COVID-19 of the
discovery cohort (including all 11 patients with PGRN-Abs), but not in ICU patients without
COVID-19 (Fig. 1 G). In this discovery cohort with severe to critical COVID-19 titers of IL1-RA-Abs ranged between 1:800 to 1:1600 (Fig. 1 H) and similar to PGRN-Abs, IL-1-RA-

Abs belonged to IgM and several IgG subclasses, except IgG4 (Fig. 1 I). The epitope region
with the highest affinity was located within amino acid 63-123 (Supplementary Fig 2 A), but
has to be narrowed down more precisely in the future.
In a validation cohort of patients with critical COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation of
the second and third wave of COVID-19 in the federal German state of Saarland or included
in the CAPSID trial, 19 of 41 (46.3%) patients had IL-1-RA-Abs. Similar to the discovery
cohort, in the validation cohort IL-1-RA-Abs often belonged to both the IgM class and
simultaneously different IgG subclasses and had similar titers (Supplementary Fig 2 C and D)
Regarding plasma of 89 patients with predominantly moderate COVID-19 of level 1 and 2
hospitals of Saarland federal German state, no IL-1-RA-Abs were detected (supplementary
Fig 2 F). IL-1-RA-Abs were not detected in 56 convalescent plasma donors with
predominantly mild courses of the CAPSID-trial (supplementary Fig. 2 H) and only with a
low titer of 1:400 in 2 of 49 patients with mild courses of COVID-19 from the Institute of
Virology from Saarland Medical Center (Fig. 1 J and supplementary Fig 2 I). IL-1-RA-Abs
were not detected in sera or plasma of 40 healthcare-workers after 2 vaccinations against
SARS-CoV2 (Supplementary Fig. 2 J). As spontaneously occurring IL-1-RA-autoantibodies
have not been described before, 188 healthy controls were screened, but none of these had IL1-RA-antibodies (supplementary Fig 2 K) (two tailed Fisher exact test: critical and severe
compared to healthy controls: p < 0.0001). To summarize, if all patients with critical COVID19 and ICU treatment are considered together, 30 of 62 patients (48.4%) had IL-1-RA-Abs
with titers 1≥800, compared to 4 of 37 patients with severe and 0 of 69 with moderate and 0
of 93 with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 with titers ≥ 1:800 (Figure 1 K) (two tailed
Fisher exact test: critical and severe compated to moderate and mild: p < 0.0001).
Autoantibodies against IL-10 were neither detected in patients with severe to critical COVID19 nor in controls from patients from intensive care unit without COVID-19 (supplementary
Fig 3).
Atypical antigen isoforms in PGRN- and IL-1-RA-antibody-positive patients
All 11 PGRN-Ab-positive patients of the discovery cohort with severe to critical COVID-19
had a double band of PGRN in isoelectric focusing (IEF), with an additional more negatively
charged isoform of PGRN (11/30; 36.7%). None of the 19 PGRN-Ab-negative patients of this
cohort and none of the 28 controls from ICU without COVID-19 had this distinct, more
negatively charged PGRN isoform (Fig. 2 A). ELISA for the previously described pSer81
PGRN isoform(32) demonstrated that this more negatively charged isoform of PGRN was the

pSer81 isoform in all 11 PGRN-Ab-positive cases and only in these (Fig. 2 B). This pSer81
PGRN isoform was detected for all PGRN-Ab-seropositive patients with titers ≥ 1:800, but
not in patients with titers ≤ 1:800 (Supplementary Fig. 1 G-H) Antibodies reactive against
enriched pSer81 PGRN isoform belonged only to the IgG class, with IgG1 subclass being
predominant (Supplementary Fig. 4 A).
In 89 patients form level 1 and 2 hospitals with mostly moderate COVID-19 (Supplementary
Fig. 1 E), 11 patients had PGRN-antibodies. They had low PGRN-Ab-titers of 1≤400 and did
not have the pSer81 isoform of PGRN (Supplementary Fig. 1 F-H).
In none of the IL-1-RA-Ab-positive patients with COVID-19 a visible difference in molecular
weight of IL-1-RA was observed in conventional Western-blot compared to IL-1-RA-Abnegative samples. However, in the IEF, an additional, more negatively charged third band of
IL-1-RA appeared in samples from IL-1-RA-Ab-positive patients. This isoform of IL-1-RA
was not seen in controls without IL-1-RA-Abs (Fig. 2 C). We then examined whether this
additional isoform is related to a different phosphorylation state. Pretreatment with alkaline
phosphatase before IEF led to the disappearance of both the normally occurring second and
the atypical additional third IL-1-RA isoform (Fig. 2 D). This proved that the additional band
represented a hyperphosphorylated IL-1-RA isoform, which was exclusively found in IL1RA-Ab-positive patients. Patients with mostly moderate courses of COVID-19 from level 1
and 2 centers of the state of Saarland and seronegative for IL-1-RA-Abs did not have the
third, more negatively charged, hyperphosphorylated isoform of IL-1-RA (Supplementary
Fig. 2 G).
Randomly selected patients with either hyperphosphorylated PGRN or hyperphosphorylated
IL-1-RA, did not have hyperphosphorylated SLP-2 (Supplementary Fig. 4 B), which is a
previously described hyperphosphorylated antigen (at Ser17) of paraproteins in plasma cell
dyscrasia and served as control(34),(35).
ELISA for cross-reactivity of absorbed PGRN-antibodies against structural proteins of
SARS-CoV-2 or Interleukin-1-Receptor Antagonist
Enriched PGRN-antibodies did neither show cross-reactivity in ELISA against recombinant
HIS-tagged SARS-CoV-2 S1-, S2-, E- or M-proteins, nor against recombinant human FLAGtagged IL-1-RA. In addition, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S1-, S2-, or M-proteins and
against human IL-1-RA could not be adsorbed by immobilized PGRN, but were instead
detectable in the eluate of samples from patients with severe or critical COVID-19, excluding
cross-reactivity of PGRN-Abs (Supplementary Fig 5).

ELISA for plasma levels of PGRN and IL-1-RA and influence PGRN-antibodyserostatus on TNF-α-induced cytotoxic effect (MTT assay)
Using standard ELISA, we observed that progranulin-levels were significantly decreased by
more than 90% in the plasma of PGRN-Ab-positive patients with COVID-19 (median: 15.12
ng/ml; SEM 3.6 ng/ml), compared to plasma of PGRN-Ab-negative patients with COVID-19
(median 161.23 ng/ml, SEM 48.14 ng/ml) (unpaired t-test: p = 0.0015) and to the plasma of
PGRN-Ab-negative patients from the ICU without COVID-19 as control (median 206.05
ng/ml; SEM 10.59 ng/ml) (unpaired t-test: p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3 A). In a functional in vitro
assay, the anti-TNF-a effects of plasma from patients with critical and severe COVID-19
with or without PGRN-Abs were examined. For this purpose, WEHI-S cells were incubated
with TNF-α and plasma from a selected subset of patients at different dilutions. As shown in
Fig. 3B, addition of plasma from patients without PGRN-Abs reduced the TNF-α-induced
cytotoxic effect on WEHI-S cells at up to higher dilutions and to a significantly higher degree
compared to PGRN-Ab containing plasma of patients with COVID-19. This anti-TNFa effect
was significant up to a plasma dilution of 1:256 or 1:128 with PGRN-Ab-negative, and –
positive samples, respectively (Fig. 3 B). Similarly, IL-1-RA plasma levels were significantly
decreased by. 88% in IL-1-RA-Ab-positive patients with COVID-19 (median 320.7 pg/ml;
SEM 66.2 pg/ml), compared to plasma of IL-1-RA-antibody-negative patients with COVID19 (median 2728 pg/ml; SEM 346.7 pg/ml) (unpaired t-test: p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3C).
One patient with critical COVID-19 and high titers of PGRN-Abs and IL-1-RA-Abs required
plasmapheresis due to exacerbating chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy
(CIDP). After 6 days of plasmapheresis titers of IL-1-RA and PGRN-Abs were strongly
decreased from 1:1600 to 1:100, the additional atypic isoform of IL-1-RA was not anymore
detectable by IEF in plasma, and IL-1-RA plasma levels rose from 34.5 pg/ml to 1022.5
pg/ml (Supplementary Fig. 6).
DISCUSSION
Here we report the occurrence of autoantibodies to PGRN and IL-1-RA in a considerable
proportion (33.9% and 48.4%, resp.) of a cohort of patients with critical COVID-19.
Importantly, such autoantibodies were not, or barely detectable in COVID-19 patients with
only moderate, mild or asymptomatic disease, nor in non-COVID-19 ICU patients or healthy
controls. Both IL-1-RA and PGRN are known to have anti-inflammatory activity, which is
potentially interesting because at least critical forms of COVID-19 display a proinflammatory

phenotype. COVID-19 has been suggested to resemble hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis
(HLH)(5), a condition associated with a hyperinflammatory dysregulation of the immune
system. Misdirected, or defective IFN I responses were reported as a key factor for inefficient
immune responses in patients with COVID-19 (13),(14),(15). Moreover, exuberant B-cell
responses were regularly found in COVID-19 (36),(37), along with a high prevalence of
antiphospholipid-(38), anti-Ro/La- (39)or anti-annexin-V-antibodies(40). It is noteworthy that
PGRN-autoantibodies were first identified in plasma from patients with different forms of
primary small vessel vasculitis. Thus, PGRN-Abs were detected in approximately 20-40% of
patients suffering from primary small, middle and large vessel vasculitis (18). This is
potentially relevant because critical forms of COVID-19 has have been shown to be
frequently associated with vasculitis-like characteristics (4), which may contribute to some of
the complications of this disease. In additional studies, PGRN-antibodies were detected in a
wide spectrum of autoimmune conditions including rheumatoid arthritis (36% of patients),
psoriatic arthritis (19% of patients) connective tissue disorders (15-40% of patients), and
inflammatory bowel diseases (15-20% of patients), but only in 1 of 97 healthy controls, in 1
of 48 elderly residents of nursing homes, and not in 40 obese control patients, nor in 22
patients with sepsis requiring intensive care treatment, nor in 98 patients with melanoma.

IL-1-RA is the physiologic inhibitor of IL-1α and IL-1β due to competition for IL-1R1. A
proinflammatory imbalance between these proteins is found in gout crystallopathies,
autoinflammatory or cryopyrin-associated periodic fever syndromes. Macrophage activation
syndrome, which has many similarities to HLH, is a common complication in systemic
juvenile idiopathic arthritis and adult-onset Still’s disease. These conditions have in common
the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome(44). Therapeutically, colchicine, recombinant
human IL-1-RA or monoclonal antibodies against IL-1β are used(45),(10). To our knowledge,
except for IL-1-RA anti-drug-antibodies(46), spontaneously occurring IL-1-RA-antibodies
have not yet been described in the literature. We have not detected them in healthy controls.
They have to be characterized more precisely and their potential occurrence in rheumatologic
or autoinflammatory disorders has to be investigated in future studies.
What might have triggered the production of PGRN- and IL-1-RA-Abs? A noteworthy
observation in this context is that in contrast to rheumatologic diseases, where PGRNantibodies largely belong to the IgG1 class(18), in COVID-19 PGRN-Abs were distributed
across the IgM and multiple IgG subclasses. Moreover, the PGRN-antibody titers were
relatively high ranging from 1:1600 up to 1:3200 (Fig. 1 C-D). Similarly, IL-1-RA-Abs were

found at relatively high titers and were also distributed across IgM and IgG subclasses (Fig. 1
H-I). These observations suggest that a recent event might have triggered the formation of
these antibodies – possibly the COVID-19 infection itself. No cross-reactivity of PGRN-Abs
with SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins was seen, though, which is indicative of an indirect
induction of at least the PGRN-Ab production. Atypical posttranslational modifications may
represent a common mechanism provoking autoimmunity (47),(48),(35),(49). In patients with
severe to critical COVID-19 with relevant titers of PGRN-Abs (≥1:800), the pSer81 PGRN
isoform was consistently found, whereas it was not detected in any PGRN-Ab-negative
subjects. In previous studies, we had identified a posttranslationally modified pSer81 PGRN
isoform exclusively in PGRN-Ab-positive patients, preceding antibody formation, as the
reason for the immunogenicity of PGRN (32). Moreover, this second pSer81 isoform led to
altered functions of PGRN, with a dramatic reduction in its affinity to TNFR1/2 and DR3 and
consequently a loss of PGRN’s ability to antagonize to TNF-α and TL1A effects (32). In
autoimmune diseases PKCß1 was identified as the kinase and PP1 as the phosphatase relevant
for phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Ser81 PGRN and inactivation of PP1 seemed to
be responsible for the observed phosphorylation of PGRN at the Ser81 residue (32).
Likewise, in the present work, we found that IL-1-RA showed an additional, i.e. a third
hyperphosphorylated isoform. This was found exclusively and without exception in all
patients with high-titers of antibodies against IL-1-RA. The exact site of differential
hyperphosphorylation is currently still under investigation. Since for both PGRN and IL-1-RA
an additional hyperphosphorylated isoform was found, one may assume that this similar
posttranslational alteration reflects a more general mechanism of autoimmunity in the context
of COVID-19. This view is further supported by the concomitant presence of PGRNantibodies and IL-1-RA-antibodies. Further studies will be needed to clarify the processes
underlying this autoimmune response to COVID-19, for instance by examining samples
collected longitudinally, and also trying to identify kinase(s) and phosphatase(s), as well as
the T- and B-cell immune responses involved in this context.
Whatever the primary cause of the loss of self-tolerance to PGRN and IL-1-RA, the present
observations raise the question of what potential clinical implications the autoantibodies
might have. Notably, PGRN and IL-1-RA plasma levels were substantially reduced (by more
than 90%) in patients with PGRN-Abs as compared to PGRN-Ab-negative patients (Fig 3 A).
This contrasts with the recent finding that patients with COVID-19 had elevated PGRN
plasma levels, as detected by 96-plex proximity extension assay (50). The reason for this
discrepancy is unclear, but it might be explained by different assay kits measuring free or

bound PGRN, and complete or converted fragments thereof. Functional confirmation of the
neutralizing effect of PGRN-antibodies in our study was obtained in a TNF-α-induced
cytotoxicity assay, which showed that plasma from PGRN-Ab-positive patients was less
effective than plasma from PGRN-Ab-negative patients in inhibiting the effect of TNFa in
vitro (Fig. 3 B). It thus appears plausible that the autoantibodies detected in the present study
have caused the observed massive reduction in the circulating levels of PGRN and IL-1-RA.
It is tempting to speculate that this reduction of two anti-inflammatory regulators might, in
turn, contribute to a proinflammatory milieu in a relevant subgroup of critically affected
patients with COVID-19. This resulting proinflammatory shift in the inflammatory balance
due to PGRN-Abs and IL-1-RA-Abs represents a different mechanism compared to
autoantibodies neutralizing type I IFN and thus weaken the antiviral immune response(16).
Based on the current results, several issues are emerging for future investigations.
In particular, it will be interesting to clarify (i) if antibodies to PGRN and IL-1-RA and
respective posttranslationally modified antigens act as predisposing factors for critical courses
of COVID-19, and (ii) if the hyperphosphorylated immunogenic isoforms are induced during,
or prior to, the SARS-CoV-2 infection (51), followed by a break of self-tolerance, and
formation of these antibodies inhibiting anti-inflammatory mediators. The broad presence of
IgM and various IgG subclasses tends to support a fresh B-cell response for both
autoantibodies. Another question is whether the presence of PRGN-antibodies (and the
ensuing reduction of PGRN) in patients with critical COVID-19 represents a causal factor in
the development of an autoimmune-like vasculitis (4).
Another potential implication of autoantibody-induced downregulation of two key
inflammatory pathways, is that targeted therapeutic approaches for this subgroup of patients
might consist in reinforcing these impaired anti-inflammatory pathways, i.e. by substitution of
recombinant blockers of the TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1-pathways in combination with
immunosuppressive agents like dexamethasone. Another targeted approach might be to block
the autoimmune response in the first place, for instance by BTK-inhibition, but this would
require to first identify which patients are predisposed to develop PGRN- and IL-1-RA
antibodies. However, for all these approaches, in addition to an increased risk of super- or
opportunistic infections, it would be essential to what extent the immune response against
SARS-CoV-2 itself would be affected. A possible next step towards evaluating the potential
of these agents as targeted therapies for treating and/or preventing a critical course of
COVID-19 would be to perform retrospective analyses of plasma samples from prospective
trials of these agents and of correlations with clinical outcome (6),(9),(8),(7),(52),(11),(53).

As plasmapheresis for a patient of the discovery cohort with coincident CIDP led to a strong
decrease of titers of both PGRN- and IL-1-RA-Abs (Supplementary Fig. 6), patients might
benefit from this, plasma exchange by convalescent plasma or IVIGs, but probably not from
cytokine absorption alone.
Future studies need to confirm the frequency of these autoantibodies in critical COVID-19, to
analyze the time course of their occurrence and their clinical relevance including the
prognostic and predictive value. Finally, the questions need to be addressed, whether these or
other pathogenic autoantibodies play a role in long-COVID and in pediatric inflammatory
multisystem syndrome.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
This study was approved by the local Ethical Review Board (Bu 62/20) and conducted
according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Plasma samples and PBMCs from 30 patients with
critical (n=21) or severe (n=9) COVID-19 of the first wave of the pandemic in the spring of
2020 and from patients without COVID-19 requiring intensive care treatment were obtained
from the COVID-19 wards of the Department of Internal Medicine II and V and the ICU of
the Department of Internal Medicine III of the Saarland University Hospital (Homburg/Saar,
Germany) were analyzed in an extended in house diagnostics for proinflammatory
autoimmunity.
For validation, blood samples from 42 patients with critical, life-threatening COVID-19
requiring mechanical ventilation and/or ECMO treatment of the Department of Internal
Medicine V of the Saarland University Hospital (Homburg/Saar, Germany) and of patients
treated within the CAPSID trial were analysed for proinflammatory autoimmunity. Plasma
samples and whole blood lysates from a control group (n=89) with mostly moderate to severe
COVID-19 at the time of blood sample collection (68% moderate, 31% severe and 1% mild)
were obtained from level 1 and 2 hospitals in Saarland federal German state. None of these 89
patients was in critical condition at the time of blood collection. However, 7 of 89 (8%)
patients died.
Regarding asymptomatic to mild courses of COVID-19, plasma and serum samples of 49
patients were obtained from the Institute of Virology of the Saarland Medical Center
Homburg/Germany and plasma samples from 56 convalescent plasma donors of the CAPSID
trial (2020-001310-38) with mostly mild courses were obtained from the Institute of Clinical
Transfusion Medicine and Immunogenetics at the University Hospital Ulm (Germany).

Blood samples of 40 vaccinated healthcare workers were obtained from MVZ
Mindelheim/Germany and from the institute of virology of Saarland Medical Center
Homburg/Germany.
Except for two samples with moderate COVID-19, all samples were from adult patients. All
plasma and PBMC samples were stored at -20°C or -80°C, respectively until use.
ELISA for autoantibodies against PGRN, IL-1-RA and IL-10
The ELISA for autoantibodies was performed as previously described.(41) In short, the
antigens were obtained using the coding sequences of the GRN gene encoding PGRN, IL-10
and isoform 1 precursor and isoform 2 of IL1RN, and the fragments aa1-63, aa107-177 and
aa47-123 of isoform 1 of IL-1-RA which were recombinantly expressed with a C-terminal
FLAG-tag in HEK293 cells under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter (pSFI). Total
cell extracts were prepared and bound to Nunc MaxiSorp plates (eBioscience, Frankfurt,
Germany) precoated with murine anti-FLAG mAb at a dilution of 1:2,500 (v/v; SigmaAldrich, Munich, Germany) at 4°C overnight. After blocking with 1.5% (w/v) gelatin in Trisbuffered saline (TBS) and washing steps with TBS with Triton X-100, the individual plasma
samples were diluted 1:100. ELISA was performed according to standard protocols with the
following Abs: biotinylated goat antihuman heavy and light chain immunoglobulin G (IgG) at
a dilution of 1:2,500 (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany); subclass-specific sheep antihuman
IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 (Binding Site Group, Birmingham, UK) at dilutions of 1:5,000;
goat antihuman IgM (Dianova) at a dilution of 1:2,500; or goat antihuman IgA (Dianova) at a
dilution of 1:2,500. Following this step, corresponding biotinylated secondary Abs were used
for immunoassays carried out to detect IgG subclasses and IgM. Peroxidase-labelled
streptavidin (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) was used at a dilution of
1:50,000. As a cut-off for positivity, the average of the optical density (OD) of the negative
samples plus three standard deviations was applied.
Western blot, isoelectric focusing of PGRN and IL-1-RA, and ELISA for pSer81 or
npSer81 PGRN
Western blotting and isoelectric focusing was performed as described (32). Whole blood
lysates or lysates of PBMCs from PGRN- and/or IL-1-RA-antibody-positive patients and
controls were analyzed by IEF for PGRN and SLP2 isoforms and plasma samples were
analyzed for IL-1-RA isoforms. Whole blood cell lysates or lysates of PBMCs from IL-1-RAantibody positive patients were treated with alkaline phosphatase as previously described

(Fermentas/VWR,

coated overnight at 4°C with rabbit antihuman PGRN antibodies directed against the Cterminus at a dilution of 1:2500 (v/v; LsBio, Seattle,WA, USA), followed by blocking with
1.5% (w/v) gelatin in TBS and washing steps with TBS-Tx [TBS, 0.1% (v/v) Tx100].
Individual plasma samples were utilized at a dilution of 1:2, and individual whole blood cell
lysates were utilized at a dilution of 1:100. ELISA was performed according to standard
protocols. For the detection of the hyperphosphorylated pSer8 or the non-phosphorylated
Ser81 PGRN isoform, phospho-Ser81- or non-phospho-Ser81 PGRN-specific Fabs, which
had previously been selected by phage display screening (32), were used at a concentration of
10 mg/l. Following this, corresponding biotinylated antihuman Fab secondary antibodies and
subsequently peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (Roche) were used.
ELISA for antibodies against pSer81 PGRN isoform and their Ig class
To detect antibodies against pSer81 PGRN, Nunc MaxiSorp plates (eBioscience, Frankfurt,
Germany) were precoated with murine anti-HIS mAb at a dilution of 1:2,500 (v/v; SigmaAldrich, Munich, Germany) at 4°C overnight. After blocking with 1.5% (w/v) gelatin in Trisbuffered saline (TBS) and washing steps with TBS with Triton X-100, HIS-tagged pSer81specific recombinant Fabs (which had previously been selected by phage display screening
(32)), were added at 10 µg/ml followed by washing steps with TBS with Triton X-100 and
addition of lysates of PBMCs of patients with the pSer81 isoform. This was followed again by
washing steps with TBS with Triton X-100 and by addition of individual plasma samples
were diluted 1:100. Biotinylated goat antihuman heavy and light chain IgG were used at a
dilution of 1:2,500 (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany); subclass-specific sheep antihuman IgG1,
IgG2, IgG3 and IgG4 (Binding Site Group, Birmingham, UK) at dilutions of 1:5,000; and
goat antihuman IgM (Dianova) at a dilution of 1:2,500. Following this step, corresponding
biotinylated secondary Abs were used for immunoassays carried out to detect IgG subclasses
and IgM. Peroxidase-labelled streptavidin (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA)
was used at a dilution of 1:50,000.
ELISA for plasma level determination of PGRN and IL-1-RA
PGRN plasma levels were determined of 19 patients with COVID-19 without PGRN-Abs, 11
patients with COVID-19 with PGRN-Abs and 8 patients without COVID-19 and without
PGRN-Abs treated on ICU with a commercially available ELISA kit (AdipoGen, Incheon,

South Korea) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. IL-1-RA plasma levels were
determined of 20 patients positive and 12 patients negative for IL-1-RA-Abs with a
commercially available ELISA kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
TNF-α-induced cytotoxic effect (MTT assay)
To assess the functional effects of PGRN-autoantibodies in vitro, a nonradioactive viability
assay (EZ4U Cell Proliferation Assay; Biomedica, Vienna, Austria) was performed. For this
TNF-α-induced cytotoxicity indicator assay, we used the highly TNF-α-sensitive mouse
fibrosarcoma WEHI-S cell line as target cells. In short, 4x104 WEHI-S cells were seeded into
200 μl of cell culture at 37°C and 5% CO2. To detect possible differences of TNF-a inhibiting
activity in plasma between patients with or without PGRN-Abs, plasma of patients with
COVID-19 with or without PGRN-Abs was added in dilutions from 1:8 to 1:512 to cultured
WEHI-S cells, followed by administration of TNF-α (100 pg/ml). WEHI-S cells without
addition of TNF-α and plasma, or solely with addition of TNF-α (100 pg/ml), were used as
positive and negative controls, respectively. After 48 hours of incubation at 37°C,
chromophore substrate was added to each well. This chromophore substrate is converted only
by vital cells. The adsorption of the product was measured at an OD of 450 nm.
ELISA for cross-reactivity of absorbed PGRN-antibodies against structural proteins of
SARS-CoV-2
PGRN-Abs were enriched using plasma from patients listed below. For this purpose, 500 µl
of lysate of HEK293 cells transfected with recombinant FLAG-tagged PGRN was incubated
with 20 ml anti-FLAG matrix for 15 min at room temperature. PGRN-antibody positive
patient's plasma (500 µl) was diluted 1:10 (v/v) in PBS and was incubated with the antiFLAG matrix/FLAG-tagged PGRN complex and subsequently desorbed by elution with
glycine buffer depleted. Elution was performed with 100 ml of 0.1 M glycine pH 3. The
patient plasma, the flow-through, the eluted enriched PGRN-Abs and plasma of controls listed
below were screened by ELISA for reactivity against recombinant HIS-tagged SARS-CoV-2
S1- and S2-proteins, N-protein and M-protein expressed in HEK293 cell (ABIN) and against
reactivity against FLAG-tagged PGRN, precursor of IL-1-RA isoform 1 and IL-1-RA isoform
2. PGRN-antibodies were purified from plasma patient #10 and #20 of a cohort with moderate
and severe COVID-19 infection, respectively. Plasma from two healthy control, from a
patient with rheumatologic disease with PGRN-Abs and without COVID-19, from a patient
with rheumatologic disease without PGRN-Abs and without COVID-19 served as controls.

Figure legends:
Figure 1: A) Occurrence of anti-PGRN antibodies in plasma from patients with moderate to
severe COVID-19 of the discovery cohort and B) in control patients from intensive care unit
without COVID-19. C) Titers of PGRN-antibodies from patients with COVID-19 of the
discovery cohort. D) Ig classes and IgG subclasses of autoantibodies. E) PGRN-antibodies
were detected at low titers in two patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. F)
Collectively, PGRN-Abs with relevant titers ≥1:800 were detected in patients with severe
COVID-19 of the discovery and validation cohorts with severe COVID-19 in 22 of 65
patients (33.8%), compared to an occurrence of 2 in 205 patients (1%) with asymptomatic,
mild or moderate COVID-19. G) Occurrence of IL-1RA-antibodies in patients with moderate
to severe COVID-19 of the discovery cohort and in controls from patients from intensive care
unit without COVID-19. H) Titers of IL-1-RA-antibodies from patients with COVID-19 and
I) Ig classes and IgG subclasses. J) Only weak, but no relevant IL-1-RA-antibodies were
detected in patients with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. K) Collectively, IL-1-RA-Abs
with relevant titers ≥1:800 were detected in patients with severe COVID-19 of the discovery
and validation cohorts with severe COVID-19 in 30 of 65 patients (46.2%), compared to an
occurrence of 4 in 205 patients (2%) with asymptomatic, mild or moderate COVID-19.
Figure 2: A) IEF of PGRN in plasma from 30 (#1-#30) patients of the discovery cohort with
moderate to severe COVID-19 and in 28 controls from patients from ICU without COVID-19.
An additional and more negatively charged PGRN isoform appeared in the gel, which was not
detected in a healthy control and PGRN-Ab-negative patients. B) ELISA for pSer81 PGRN
isoform and for non-phosphorylated Ser81 PGRN isoform. C) WB and IEF of IL-1-RA in IL1-RA-antibody-positive patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. An additional and
differentially charged IL-1-RA isoform appeared, which was not detected in a healthy
controls and IL-1-RA-Ab-negative patients. IEF of IL-1-RA isoforms from two IL-1-RA-Abpositive patients (#19 and #20) and a healthy control without IL-1-RA-Abs before and after
alkaline phosphatase treatment. Alkaline phosphatase treatment led to disappearance of the
second hyperphosphorylated isoform, which occurs also in the healthy control, and of the
third, atypical isoform.

COVID-19 (15.21 ng/ml). Data are represented with median and interquartile range. B) Effect
of PGRN-antibody status on inhibition of TNF-α-induced cytotoxicity. WEHI-S cells were
incubated with TNF-α (or PBS) and plasma of PGRN-antibody-positive patients (COVID-19
#9 and #26) or matched PGRN-antibody-negative patient (COVID #5), as indicated. The
plasma of the patients #9 and #26 with PGRN-antibodies resulted in a weaker inhibition of
TNF-α-mediated cytotoxicity. The adsorbance of colored Formazan, as a marker for cell
viability was detected at 450 nm. C) IL-1-RA plasma levels in patients with COVID-19 and
ICU controls. IL-1-RA plasma levels were determined in patients with COVID-19 without
IL-RA-antibodies (median 2566 pg/ml) and in IL-1-RA-antibody-positive patients with
COVID-19 (median 192 pg/ml). Data are represented with median and interquartile range.
