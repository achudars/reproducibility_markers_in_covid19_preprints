Coronavirus genome replication is associated with virus-induced cytosolic doublemembrane vesicles, which may provide a tailored micro-environment for viral RNA
synthesis in the infected cell. However, it is unclear how newly synthesized genomes and
mRNAs can travel from these sealed replication compartments to the cytosol to ensure
their translation and the assembly of progeny virions. Here, using cellular electron cryomicroscopy, we unveiled a molecular pore complex that spans both membranes of the
double-membrane vesicle and would allow export of RNA to the cytosol. A hexameric
assembly of a large viral transmembrane protein was found to form the core of the
crown-shaped complex. This coronavirus-specific structure likely plays a critical role in
coronavirus replication and thus constitutes a novel drug target
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) constitutes the third and
most impactful example of a potentially lethal coronavirus infection in humans within the last
20 years [1-3]. The realization that such zoonotic transmissions will remain a public health
threat has resurged the need to dissect coronavirus molecular biology. Coronaviruses are
positive-stranded RNA (+RNA) viruses that replicate their unusually large genomes in the
host cell’s cytoplasm. This process is supported by an elaborate virus-induced network of
transformed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes known as the viral replication organelle
(RO) [4-7]. Double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) are the RO’s most abundant component and
the central hubs for viral RNA synthesis [5], which includes genome replication and the
synthesis of a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs. The DMV’s interior accumulates doublestranded (ds) RNA [4, 5], presumably intermediates of viral RNA synthesis, and may
constitute a favorable micro-environment where factors relevant for RNA synthesis
accumulate and viral dsRNA is shielded from innate immune sensors. Intriguingly, however,
coronavirus-induced DMVs have been characterized as compartments that lack openings to
the cytosol [4-6], despite the fact that newly-made viral mRNAs need to be transported to the

cytosol for translation. Moreover, the coronavirus genome needs to be packaged by the
cytosolic nucleocapsid (N) protein, before being targeted to budding sites on secretory
pathway membranes, where progeny virions assemble [8].

segmented content annotated.

To date, the structure of coronavirus-induced ROs in their native host cellular environment
has not been analyzed by electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). The murine hepatitis
coronavirus (MHV) is a well-studied model for the genus betacoronavirus, which also
includes SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. One advantage of MHV over these
class-3 agents is the absence of serious biosafety constraints, enabling its use for in situ cryoEM studies. To this end, we performed electron tomography (ET) on cryo-lamellae prepared
by focused ion beam milling cells in the middle stage of MHV infection, when the virusinduced RO occupies large regions of the cytoplasm. The tomograms revealed abundant
perinuclear DMVs having an average diameter of 257 nm (SD ± 63 nm), occasionally
interconnected or connected to the ER as part of the reticulovesicular network previously
described (Fig. 1, Fig. S1) [4-7]. Additionally, striking macromolecular features that
previously could not be discerned in conventional EM samples became apparent (Fig. S2-4).
The DMV lumen appeared to primarily contain filamentous structures that likely correspond
to viral RNA (Fig. 1, Fig. S4), part of which, at least, is expected to be present as dsRNA [4,
5]. In fact, some of these filaments contained relatively long straight stretches, which is
consistent with the much higher persistence length of dsRNA over ssRNA [9] (Fig. S4).
Most strikingly, our data revealed that each MHV-induced DMV contains multiple copies of
a molecular complex that spans both membranes and connects the DMV interior with the
cytosol (Fig. 2A). Such complexes were also found in DMVs in pre-fixed SARS-CoV-2infected cells (Fig. 2B, Fig. S5). We surmise that this pore represents a generic coronavirusinduced molecular complex playing a pivotal role in the viral replication cycle, most likely by

allowing the export of newly synthesized viral RNA from the DMV interior to the cytosol.
Functionally analogous viral complexes used for RNA export include those found in the
capsids of the Reoviridae [10] and, interestingly, the molecular pore in the neck of the
invaginated replication spherules induced by flock house virus [11], although none of these is
integrated in a double-membrane organelle.

Subtomogram averaging of the double-membrane-spanning complexes in MHV-induced
DMVs unveiled that they have an overall 6-fold symmetry (Fig. 2, Fig. S6). A cytosolic
crown-like structure extends ~13 nm into the cytosol and is based on a ~24-nm wide platform
embedded between inner and outer DMV membranes, which do not fuse and maintain a
distance of ~4.5 nm, which was the typical inter-membrane spacing found in DMVs (Fig.
S2). The complex forms a channel that follows its central 6-fold axis. On the DMV luminal
side, the channel starts with a ~6-nm wide opening that narrows towards the cytosol and has
two tight transition points (Fig. 2J and Fig. 2L). The one at the level of the DMV outer

membrane (Fig. 2J) is the most constricted, with an opening of ~2-3 nm, but would still allow
the transition of RNA strands. Towards the cytosolic space, the complex opens up into the
crown-like structure, exposing six cytosolic “prongs” that extend to a radius of ~14 nm. With
an achieved resolution of 3.1 nm (Fig. S6A), we estimate that the complex has a total
molecular mass of 3 MDa, of which the crown would represent ~1.2 MDa and each
individual prong ~30 kDa (Fig. S6C).
We then considered the possible constituents of this complex. Coronavirus genome
expression starts with translation of the 5’-proximal two-thirds of the +RNA genome into two
large replicase polyproteins that are proteolytically cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins
(nsps) [12]. Three of these nsps are transmembrane proteins and thus potential candidates to
be components of the pore: nsp3 (222 kDa in MHV), nsp4 (56 kDa), and nsp6 (33 kDa),
containing two, four and six TMDs, respectively [13-15] (Fig. 3A). These nsps are known to
engage in diverse homotypic and heterotypic interactions [16] that are thought to drive the
formation of double-membrane RO structures [17-19]. Based on its size, the multidomain
MHV nsp3 subunit (~2,000 amino acids) is an attractive putative constituent of the pore.
MHV nsp3 consists of a large cytosolic region of ~160 kDa followed by two TMDs and a Cterminal cytosolic domain of ~41 kDa [13]. Whereas the TMDs and C-terminal domain are
highly conserved, the domain composition and size of the N-terminal part of nsp3 is quite
variable among coronaviruses, also due to the duplication of several domains in specific
lineages [16, 20]. Interestingly, several nsp3 domains may interact with RNA [16], including
the conserved N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain 1 (Ubl1) that binds both single-stranded (ss)
RNA [21] and the N protein [22, 23].
To investigate whether nsp3 is a component of the DMV molecular pore, we imaged cells
infected with an engineered MHV mutant lacking nsp2 and expressing a nsp3 with an
enhanced GFP (EGFP) moiety fused to the Ubl1 domain (MHV-Δ2-GFP [24]) (Fig. S7).
Subtomogram averaging of the pore complexes in these samples (Fig. 3B) revealed the
presence of additional densities on top of the prongs, representing a mass compatible with
that of EGFP (Fig. 3C-E). These results unambiguously identified nsp3 as a major constituent
of the complex and provided a first clue on its orientation, with the 12.6-kDa Ubl1 domain
residing in the prongs of the structure. Given the observed 6-fold symmetry of the complex,
six copies of nsp3 can be envisioned to constitute most of the cytosolic crown-like structure
(~1.2 MDa). Likely, other viral and/or host proteins are also involved in the formation of the
~1.8 MDa inter-membrane platform, with the nsp4 and nsp6 transmembrane subunits being
prominent candidates. In fact, studies in expression systems suggest that nsp3-nsp4
interactions could drive the membrane pairing that may be the initial step in DMV formation
[17-19], while mutagenesis of the luminal domain of nsp4 results in aberrant DMV formation
during infection [25].

The molecular pores frequently appear to interact with other macromolecules on both the
cytosolic and the DMV luminal side (Fig. S8). These interactions seem to be dynamic as in
the averages they show as largely blurred out densities that appear to extend either from the
cytosolic prongs or from the opening at the DMV luminal side of the pore complex (Fig. 2C).
A smaller region of the latter, however, showed relatively higher density, and was resolved in
unsymmetrized averages as a closely associated and slightly off-centered mass (Fig. 2M, N,
Fig. S6D), which can be speculated to be part of the viral replication machinery. The
replication/transcription complex (RTC) of coronaviruses is thought to consist of a subset of
relatively small (~10-110 kDa) nsps with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12) at its
core [26-28]. However, some of these subunits may associate with the RTC only transiently
and the nsp stoichiometries of the complex are unknown. The tomographic data did not
reveal clear macromolecular features within the DMV lumen that would suggest the
formation of larger RTC assemblies. Interestingly, however, the luminal interaction partners
of the pore complex, prominent as masses varying in shape and size, appear to interact with
the putative RNA content of the DMV lumen (Fig. S8).
The interaction partners of the cytosolic nsp3 prong do not show a uniform picture either,
ranging from chain-like masses protruding from the prongs to larger assemblies (Fig S8,
black arrowheads). The subdomains of the long N-terminal nsp3 domain engage in a range of
viral and virus-host interactions [16, 20]. Consequently, the list of possible prong interactors
is long, but among them the viral N protein (55 kDa) is a prominent candidate as it was
shown to bind the Ubl1 domain that resides in the nsp3 prong [22, 23]. The Ubl1-N
interaction was proposed to target viral RNA to replication sites early in infection [23], but it

is tempting to speculate that it may also modulate RNA exit and encapsidation on the
cytosolic side of the pore complex). Notably, DMV-rich regions of the cytosol were often
crowded with protein assemblies with an approximate diameter of 15 nm (Fig. S9). These
strongly resembled the condensed nucleocapsid structure observed in coronavirus particles, a
helical ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) consisting of the RNA genome in tight association
with N protein oligomers [29] (Fig. S9).
Our findings thus suggest a pathway for viral genomic RNA from the putative site of RNA
synthesis inside DMVs, via the channel of the pore into the cytoplasm, where it would be
encapsidated. In our model, either during or after viral RNA synthesis, specific replicase
subunits may associate with the pore complex to guide the newly synthesized RNA towards it
(Fig. 4A). As proposed for other +RNA viral ROs [11], only positive-stranded RNAs would
need to be exported, whereas their low abundance negative-stranded templates could remain
inside the DMVs. Subsequently, on the cytosolic side, it remains an open question whether
all exported viral mRNAs would associate with the N protein (Fig. 4B). Alternatively, the
interaction of viral mRNAs with the accumulating N protein could serve to select part of the
newly made genomes for packaging, while the remainder would be used for translation,
together with the much smaller subgenomic mRNAs that constitute ~95% of the viral RNA
products [30]. Genome-containing RNPs would travel to membrane sites where the viral
envelope proteins accumulate and engage in the formation of progeny virions (Fig. 4C) [31].
These bud into single-membrane compartments (Fig. 4D), typically derived from the ER-toGolgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) [8], and travel along the secretory pathway to be
released into extracellular space.

The double-membrane-spanning molecular pore revealed in this study is a unique and
complex structure that could only be unveiled in its native functional context by cellular cryoEM. This complex likely constitutes the long-sought exit pathway for coronaviral RNA
products from the DMV’s interior towards the cytosol, with the large and multifunctional
nsp3 being its central component. Although the exact mode of function of this molecular pore
remains to be elucidated, it would clearly represent a key structure in the viral replication
cycle that is likely conserved among coronaviruses, and thus may constitute a general
coronavirus-specific drug target.
