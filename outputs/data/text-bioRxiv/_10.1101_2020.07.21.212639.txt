Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus that has rapidly spread, causing a global pandemic. In the
majority of infected patients, SARS-CoV-2 leads to mild disease; however, in a significant
proportion of infections, individuals develop severe symptoms that can lead to permanent lung
damage or death. These severe cases are often associated with high levels of pro-inflammatory
cytokines and low antiviral responses which can lead to systemic complications. We have
evaluated transcriptional and cytokine secretion profiles from infected cell cultures and detected
a distinct upregulation of inflammatory cytokines that parallels samples taken from infected
patients. Building on these observations, we found a specific activation of NF-κB and a block
of IRF3 nuclear translocation in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. This NF-κB response is mediated
by cGAS-STING activation and could be attenuated through STING targeting drugs. Our
results show that SARS-CoV-2 curates a cGAS-STING mediated NF-κB driven inflammatory
immune response in epithelial cells that likely contributes to inflammatory responses seen in
patients and might be a target to suppress severe disease symptoms.

Introduction
In late 2019 SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a highly infectious coronavirus that causes respiratory
disease in humans, termed COVID-19. Since the initial identification, SARS-CoV-2 has spread
around the world leading the World Health Organization to declare a pandemic. SARS-CoV-2
infection causes respiratory symptoms that range from mild to severe and can result in lasting
lung damage or death in a significant number of cases 1. One of the hallmarks of severe COVID19 disease is low levels of type I interferons (IFNs) and overproduction of inflammatory
cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF 2-5. This unbalanced immune response fails to limit virus spread
and can cause severe systemic symptoms 3,6. Therapies aimed at modulating immune activation
to attenuate the detrimental inflammatory response or promote an antiviral cytokine response
represents an important avenue for treating patients with severe COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 is a plus-strand RNA virus that replicates its genome in the cytosolic
compartment of the cells. Like all plus-strand RNA viruses, this replication process requires
the production of a negative-strand RNA template in order to amplify the positive sense viral
genome. This process and probably also the production of subgenomic RNAs of negative and
positive polarity, produces double strand (ds)RNAs that can be sensed by cytosolic immune
receptors (pattern recognition receptors, PRRs) that subsequently activate antiviral pathways 7.
In addition to direct viral sensing, cells have also evolved ways to detect the indirect effects of
virus infection, such as nuclear or mitochondrial damage caused by the heavy cellular burden
of virus replication. Cytoplasmic DNA sensors including cGAS-STING, IFI16, or AIM2,
recognize dsDNA from DNA viruses, but have also been shown to play an important role in
RNA virus infection, either through directly recognising viral signatures or through sensing of
cellular DNA released from mitochondria or nuclei due to cellular stress (reviewed in

8,9

).

Substrate recognition by either RNA or DNA sensors leads to signalling cascades that activate
two major branches of the innate immune response, the type I/III IFN response and the

inflammatory cytokine response. The type I/III IFN pathways are directly involved in protecting
neighboring cells from virus spread and are vital for the immediate cell-intrinsic antiviral
response. The inflammatory cytokine response is involved in recruitment and activation of
immune cells, which is required to initiate an adaptive immune response.
Due to the effective nature of innate immune sensing and responses plus-strand RNA
viruses have evolved numerous ways to limit or block these cellular pathways. For many
viruses, the initial line of defence is to hide viral replication intermediates within membrane
compartments that block access to cytosolic PRRs, such as RIG-I or MDA5 10. In the case of
coronaviruses, this is achieved through the formation of replication organelles composed
predominantly of double membrane vesicles, within which viral RNA replication occurs 11,12.
Coronaviruses can also evade recognition by immune receptors through modification of viral
RNA to resemble host mRNA13-16. In addition to these passive immune evasion strategies,
coronaviruses utilize various mechanisms to actively target and block key immune sensors or
signalling molecules (reviewed in 17,18). For SARS-CoV-1, a closely related virus, several viral
proteins have been shown to block RIG-I/MDA5 sensing, as well as the downstream activation
of TBK1 and IRF3

19-24

. SARS-CoV-1 also efficiently blocks IFN receptor and JAK-STAT

signalling to stop downstream immune activation

19,25-27

. Additionally, the SARS-CoV-

1 papain-like protease (PLP) has been shown to interfere with cGAS-STING activation also
limiting activation of innate immune pathways 28. The combination of these actions can lead to
an imbalance between proinflammatory and antiviral immune responses.
Although numerous immune evasion mechanisms have been characterized for other
pathogenic coronaviruses, it remains to be determined whether similar processes exist for
SARS-CoV-2. Given the homology of SARS-CoV-1 to SARS-CoV-2, they may have many
conserved antagonistic strategies, however, key differences in infection and disease could
suggest divergent pathways. Early reports on SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated that infection is
highly sensitive to type I/III IFN treatment

29-32

. In combination with the low levels of IFN

reported to be secreted in severe cases, this suggests that like SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2
infection actively blocks immune activation. Transcriptomic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 infected
cells generated ambiguous results on the induction of type I/III IFNs and the subsequent
expression of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs). On the one hand, it was shown that SARS-CoV-2
triggers only an attenuated immune response suggesting a block in PRR signaling pathways,
which would parallel SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infections 29. On the other hand, several
studies argue for a strong induction of IFN responses in both lung and intestinal infection
models

30,33

. Additionally, proteomics approaches determining SARS-CoV-2 protein

interactions with host factors in exogenous expression conditions revealed several interactions
with key immune regulators including MAVS, TBK1 and several co-factors involved in IRF3
activation 34,35. However, many of these findings are still observational leaving the mechanisms
of SARS-CoV-2 innate immune response modulation unresolved.
Here, we report the transcriptomic profiles derived from SARS-CoV-2 infected human
lung cells showing a specific bias towards an NF-κB mediated inflammatory response and a
restriction in the TBK1 specific IRF3/7 activation and subsequent IFN response. Consistently,
secreted cytokine profiles from both severe COVID-19 patients and SARS-CoV-2 infected lung
epithelial cells, were enriched for pro-inflammatory cytokines and lacked type I/III IFNs. We
also demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads specifically to NF-κB but not IRF3 nuclear
localization and that poly(I:C)-induced pathway activation is attenuated in infected cells.
Finally, we show that the cGAS-STING pathway is activated by SARS-CoV-2 infection,
leading to a specific NF-κB response and that inflammatory cytokine upregulation can be
mitigated by STING inhibitory drugs. These results provide insight into how innate immune
responses are modulated by SARS-CoV-2 in epithelial cells likely contributing to the strong
inflammatory responses observed in severe COVID-19 cases.

Results
Kinetics of SARS-COV-2 infection in lung epithelial cells
SARS-CoV-2 predominantly infects airway and lung tissue in infected individuals. In order to
determine the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on human lung epithelial cells, Calu-3 and A549 cells
were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and virus growth, as well as host transcriptional architecture
was determined over a time course of infection. In contrast to Calu-3, A549 cells lack
endogenous expression of the major SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and, hence, are not
naturally permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection 36. We therefore used an engineered A549 cell
line stably expressing ACE2 (A549-ACE2), which is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection
12,37

. For both, A549-ACE2 and Calu-3 cells, we observed an increase in intracellular viral RNA

starting at 4 h post infection, which continued to increase up to 24 h post infection (Fig. 1a-b).
Increased extracellular virus RNA was observed starting at 6 h post infection which was
paralleled by the release of infectious virus (Fig. 1a-c). The levels of viral RNA, production of
infectious virus and virus spread were significantly higher in Calu-3 cells compared to A549ACE2 cells (Fig. 1d-e).
To determine the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the host transcriptional
architecture, total RNA was isolated at 4 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h post infection and analyzed by
microarray (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 1). Analysis of significantly differentially expressed
genes showed substantial transcriptomic changes in Calu-3 cells with a total of 3215
differentially expressed genes (FDR< 10%, Fig. 2a). Less genes were differentially expressed
in A549-ACE2 cells (Fig. 2b). Principal component analyses (PCA) showed significant effects
of SARS-CoV-2 infection on Calu-3 cells, especially at 24 h post infection (Extended Data Fig.
1a). We did not observe an overall decrease in total mRNA quality or large differences in probe
intensity, thus showing no indication that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a general
transcriptional shutdown. Importantly, we observed a high degree of overlap between top

significantly upregulated or downregulated genes from both cell lines (Extended Data Fig. 1bc). However, in A549-ACE2 cells, there was less overall change in transcript levels following
infection (Fig. 2b, and Extended Data Fig. 1a and 1d), which is likely due to the lower levels
of infection (~40% vs 80% at 24 h of A549-ACE2 vs Calu-3, respectively)(Fig. 1e). Gene-set
enrichment analysis of the transcriptional changes using curated “Hallmark” pathways showed
a strong upregulation of inflammatory responses in both cell lines, with gene sets from NF-κB
and IL6-STAT3 pathways showing a high degree of enrichment (Fig. 2c-e and Extended Data
Fig. 1d)38. Interestingly, transcripts involved in the type I/III IFN pathways showed little change
over the course of infection. These results suggest that in lung cells, the response to SARSCoV-2 infection is dominated by pro-inflammatory, NF-κB-driven pathways, with little to no
contribution of the antiviral IFN system.
Cell culture inflammatory responses parallels COVID-19 patient cytokine profiles
Transcriptional activation of NF-κB and inflammatory cytokine pathways in cultured
cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 indicate that infected epithelial cells might contribute directly
to the cytokine profiles observed in severe COVID-19 2. To test this we compared the levels of
secreted cytokines from infected Calu-3 cells to cytokine levels in serum, tracheal secretion,
and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples taken from infected patients with severe
COVID-19 (Fig. 3a-b). Consistent with previous reports, infected patients had high levels of
inflammatory cytokines including IL-6, TNF, Il-1β and IFNγ (Fig. 3a-d)2. Increases in IL-6
were also observed at early time points after infection of Calu-3 cells as well as high levels of
the chemokine CXCL10/IP-10 at 24 h post infection (Fig. 3e). In contrast, no consistently
detectable upregulation was found for IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and IFNλ2/3, whereas a rather
moderate increase of IFNλ1 expression was found, but only at the late time point of Calu-3 cell
infection. Together, these results corroborate published data showing that, in severe cases,
SARS-CoV-2 infection preferentially induces a pro-inflammatory cytokine production with

little activation of the antiviral responses. Additionally, these data indicate that infected
epithelial cells secrete cytokines that can contribute to induction of tissue-level inflammation.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is susceptible to type I/III IFN induced antiviral state
To confirm that the lack of IFN response in Calu-3 or A549-ACE2 cells infected with
SARS-CoV-2 was not due to defects in the activation of innate immune pathways, we
challenged these cells with dsRNA or other RNA virus infections. In Calu-3 cells transfected
with dsRNA or infected with influenza virus or Sendai virus, we observed a robust upregulation
of the IFN response (Fig. 4a). For A549 cells, similar transcriptional activation of ISGs was
observed between wild type and ACE2-expressing cells in response to Zika virus (ZIKV)
infection, a potent inducer of the IFN system (Fig. 4b-c). Notably, while magnitudes of the proinflammatory TNF mRNA were comparable between ZIKV and SARS-CoV-2 infection in
A549-ACE2 cells, SARS-CoV-2 infection failed to induce IFN or classical ISGs, such as IFIT1
(Fig. 4c).
Given the lack of an IFN response in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, we next determined
the effects of different IFN types on virus replication. Calu-3 or A549-ACE2 cells were
pretreated with serial dilutions of type I, II or III IFNs, for 6 h followed by infection with SARSCoV-2. In Calu-3 cells all IFNs reduced virus replication, with type I IFNs having the strongest
effect, and IFNγ having the least effect (Fig. 4d – top panel; Extended Data Fig. 2). In the case
of A549-ACE2 cells, IFNλ1 and IFNγ had little effect on virus replication, while IFNα or IFNβ
pre-treatment robustly limited SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 4d – bottom panel; Extended Data
Fig. 2). These results are consistent with previous studies and further suggest that SARS-CoV2 is susceptible to the antiviral state induced by IFNs prior to infection 29,30.
To test if IFNs could limit virus replication even after establishment of infection, A549ACE2 cells were treated with high levels of various IFNs at the time point of infection or 6 h
thereafter. Pre-treatment with type I IFNs, serving as control, blocked virus infection, whereas
co- or post-treatment had significantly less effects (Fig. 4e-f). Of note, the 2-fold decrease in

virus replication following post-treatment with type I IFNs likely represents a block in virus
spread following the first round of infection, as only ~40-50% of cells were observed to be
infected at the 6 h time point (Fig. 1e). Together, these observations suggest that SARS-CoV2 likely supresses the production of IFNs and antiviral ISGs, and that it furthermore rapidly and
potently blocks IFN signalling in infected cells.
SARS-COV-2 infection specifically activates NF-κB but not IRF3
The high levels of inflammatory gene activation and the lack of IFNs and ISGs in
response to SARS-CoV-2 infection lead us to investigate which transcription factors of the cellintrinsic immunity are activated by the virus. In general, sensing of viral infection in epithelial
cells by cytosolic innate immune receptors leads to the activation (i.e. phosphorylation) and
nuclear translocation of the two hallmark transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB, which in turn
leads to transcriptional upregulation of antiviral and inflammatory genes. To evaluate the
impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on these pathways, we quantified the nuclear translocation of
IRF3 and NF-κB in infected A549-ACE2 cells (Fig. 5a-c). Consistent with our transcriptomic
data showing limited activation of antiviral genes, we observed no nuclear accumulation of
IRF3 in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, whereas a significant portion of infected cells showed
nuclear translocation of NF-κB (Fig. 5a-b). In line with this, western blotting also showed
increased levels of phosphorylated NF-κB p65/RELA starting at 12 h post infection
accompanied by a decrease in IκB levels (Fig. 5d-e). These results suggest that in SARS-CoV2 infection NF-κB is selectively activated or that IRF3 activation is supressed.
SARS-CoV-2 interferes with poly(I:C)-mediated PRR activation
To determine if SARS-CoV-2 can actively block immune stimulation through cytosolic
PRRs, 6 h after infection, cells were challenged by transfection with the dsRNA mimic
poly(I:C). Activation of innate immune signaling was then assessed by monitoring the nuclear
translocation of transcription factors and by measuring transcript levels of prototypic
downstream ISGs. Compared to uninfected control cells, the upregulation of IFIT1 and IFIT3

in response to poly(I:C)-stimulation was significantly lower in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells
(Fig. 5f). Consistently, we observed less nuclear translocation of IRF3 in response to poly(I:C)
transfection in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells as compared to mock infected cells (Fig. 5g-i).
Poly(I:C) transfection further lead to a slight reduction in the number of infected cells, likely
due to limited virus spread (Fig. 5c – NT vs poly(I:C)). These data indicate a block of the PRR
mediated IRF3 response in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.
Inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is mediated by cGAS-STING
To determine the source of the SARS-CoV-2 induced inflammatory response or
downstream immune activation, we evaluated the effects of innate immune receptor knockout
or overexpression. We first looked at RNA receptors that have previously been described to
recognize viral RNAs including RIG-I, MDA5 and TLR3 as well as IFN receptors. RIGI/MDA5 double knockout, TLR3 overexpression, or IFN receptor (IFNAR, IFNGR, IFNLR)
triple knockout A549-ACE2 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the upregulation of
IFIT1 (IRF3 target) and TNF (NF-κB target) transcript levels were used as readouts for pathway
activation. No significant changes in IFIT1 mRNA, TNF mRNA levels or viral RNA levels
were observed in any of the cell lines compared to control cells (Extended Data Fig. 3a-b).
Together, these data indicate that recognition of viral RNA via cellular RNA sensors is not
involved in NF-κB activation in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.
Although cGAS is a sensor of cytosolic DNA, induction of the cGAS-STING-signaling
axis leading to activation of NF-κB and IRF3 has been reported for several RNA virus
infections, most likely through cellular stress responses 9. To determine whether the cGASSTING pathway is triggered in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we first evaluated changes in
localization of cGAS or STING in infected cells. Indeed, both cGAS and STING were observed
to re-localize to perinuclear clusters in infected cells, indicative of activation (Fig. 6a-b). Costaining for cGAS and dsDNA in infected cells also showed that dsDNA colocalized with cGAS
in infected cells (Fig. 6c). Additionally, we observed that, unlike in poly(I:C)-mediated
10

activation of RLRs, SARS-CoV-2 infection did not interfere with activation of the cGASSTING pathway by dsDNA transfection (Extended Data Fig. 3c-d).
To confirm that cGAS-STING activation is involved in the observed induction of proinflammatory cytokines, we examined the effects of pharmacologically blocking STING in
SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. One hour post infection, cells were treated with the STING
specific inhibitor H-151, the TBK1 inhibitor amlexanox (Amx), or DMSO. At 24 h post
infection, we observed a significant decrease in the levels of TNF mRNA in infected cells
treated with H-151 compared to DMSO treated cells (Fig. 6d), both, in A549-ACE2 and Calu3. This decrease was not observed for Amx treated cells. Infection levels and cell viability were
not significantly affected at the effective concentration (Extended Data Fig. 3e-g). Together
these results indicate that SARS-CoV2-infection triggers the cGAS-STING pathway, leading
to NF-κB-mediated induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and that this response can be
controlled with STING inhibitors.
Although STING activation is usually associated with both, NF-κB as well as IRF3
activation, several reports have suggested that interfering with proper translocation of STING
from the ER to Golgi compartments can selectively stimulate the NF-κB pathway 39,40. To test
whether this is the case in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, we determined the localization of
STING relative to Golgi markers by microscopy. Consistent with previous reports, in cells
transfected with dsDNA, we observed STING translocation to the Golgi compartment
(Extended Data Fig. 3h). No significant colocalization of Golgi markers and STING were
observed in either mock or SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, suggesting that STING translocation
may be impaired (Fig. 6e-f). Moreover, we found that clusters of STING in SARS-CoV-2
infected cells colocalized with viral nucleocapsid (N) protein (Fig. 6g-h; Extended Data Fig.
3i). Together, these results suggest that STING is activated in SARS-CoV-2 infection, but
inhibited from translocating to the Golgi, leading to a specific NF-κB inflammatory response
in infected cells.

Discussion
In this study, we combine transcriptional profiling and cytokine secretion analyses to
characterize the pro-inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and evaluate
the virus-induced signalling pathways mediating this response. We report that both virusinduced transcriptional changes and cytokine profiles from infected epithelial cell cultures
parallel cytokine profiles from patient BAL fluid, tracheal secretions and serum samples,
indicating a role for infected epithelial cells to contribute to the hyper-inflammatory response
described for patients suffering severe COVID-19. This pro-inflammatory response in infected
epithelial cells is initiated by an activation of NF-κB with a concurrent robust block of the IRF3
and IFN pathways. We further demonstrate that this activation of NF-κB is not mediated by the
expected viral RNA recognizing receptors of the RLR or TLR family, but instead SARS-CoV2
infection leads to the activation of the cGAS-STING signaling axis. Putatively by preventing
relocalization of activated STING to the Golgi, SARS-CoV-2 appears to specifically allow for
NF-κB induction while omitting the activation of the antiviral IRF3 / IFN system. Intriguingly,
upregulation of NF-κB-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, can be efficiently
blocked by the administration of pharmacological STING inhibitors.
Building on recent reports, our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes
an imbalanced immune response in infected lung epithelial cells, resulting in an NF-κB
polarized response rather than a classic antiviral immune response (NF-κB, IRF3/7 and IFN
signalling), which is likely amplified by immune cells to produce the cytokine storm symptoms
associated with COVID-19

3,29,41,42

. Pro-inflammatory cytokine responses are an important

aspect of the innate immune response that are required to recruit professional immune cells to
the site of infection and aid in the initiation of the adaptive immune response. This response,
together with the activation of antiviral pathways, including type I/III IFNs, creates a potent
antiviral environment. Our study, in combination with several parallel studies indicates that

SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a selective inflammatory response that can cause pathogenic
inflammation without effectively controlling the virus. Similar inflammatory activation has
been observed for SARS-CoV-1 infections, where the viral ORF3a activates NF-κB to trigger
the NLRP3 inflammasome 43. Additionally, NF-κB inhibition can increase mouse survival in
SARS-CoV-1 infected mice 44. We note that several studies have indicated that SARS-CoV-2
infection leads to IFN production in lung or intestinal tissue 30,33. Our microarray results show
only a slight increase in the IFNλ1 response, and only at late time points after infection, which
indicates that the efficient inhibition of the IRF3 signalling pathway might be bypassed in some
cells with heavy virus load. Increased immune activation has also been reported when cells are
infected with excessive amounts of virus 29. This could be due to high levels of cellular stress
or high levels of virus dsRNA in cells at these later time points. In either case, this immune
activation indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection does not completely block the antiviral
immune activation, at least at late time points after infection.
We demonstrate that type I/III IFNs block SARS-CoV-2 infection in lung cells,
consistent with several recent studies, but this effect is rapidly diminished once virus replication
has been established. These results corroborate the notion that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to
a robust block in IFN receptor mediated signaling, which is similar to observations with SARSCoV-1 and MERS-CoV. Additionally, our transcriptional analysis and cytokine profiles show
that SARS-CoV-2 infection also fails to produce a significant IFN response in infected lung
epithelial cells, which could trigger a paracrine response, limiting virus spread. In addition to
blocking IFN signalling, SARS-CoV-2 infection limits the activation of dsRNA sensing PRR
pathways even when exogenously stimulated by poly(I:C) transfection. Together these results
demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infection, similar to SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, employs
mechanisms to robustly block immune sensing of viral RNA by RLRs, as well as the

Further evaluation of the SARS-CoV-2 induced pro-inflammatory response showed a
specific induction of NF-κB, but not of IRF3 or the subsequent IFN signalling. NF-κB can be
activated through numerous immune or stress stimuli including the ER stress responses or
increase in cytosolic reactive oxygen species, as well as through detection of cytosolic DNA
released from the nucleus or mitochondria (reviewed in 8,45,46). Our results indicate that cGASSTING activation is a major contributor to NF-κB activation in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.
Since cGAS is a dsDNA sensor that would not be expected to directly recognize SARS-CoV-2
RNA, it is likely that cellular stress or cytokine responses induced by the infection leads to
nuclear or mitochondrial DNA release which is sensed by cGAS47-51. Similar activation of
cGAS-STING has been observed for other positive strand RNA viruses including flaviviruses
and both SARS-CoV-1 and NL63 coronaviruses (reviewed in 9). For the coronaviruses, STING
activation is perturbed through the action of the viral PLP leading to an inhibition of STING
oligomerization and downstream activation of TBK1 and IRF3

28,52,53

. Intriguingly,

mechanisms for cGAS-STING modulation seem to be different in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells,
highlighting a major immunological difference between these related viruses. Of note, the
activation of NF-κB through cGAS-STING does not exclude other sources of NF-κB activation.
Indeed, we observed increases in FOS/JUN and ATF3 mRNA levels in infected cells suggesting
activation of multiple cell stress pathways 54. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of STING
did not completely block TNF upregulation, further indicating a role for other sources of NFκB-activation. We speculate that therapeutic inhibition of multiple NF-κB activation pathways
could serve to further reduce pro-inflammatory responses in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells.
The selective activation of NF-κB, rather than a general block in all immune activation
pathways, indicates a pro-viral role for NF-κB signalling. In addition to functions in
inflammation, NF-κB is also important for cell survival and proliferation 55. These NF-κB cell
survival signals could be beneficial for the virus by promoting vitality in cells in order to
facilitate efficient and sustained virus replication and spread. Mechanisms for NF-κB pathway

interference have been reported for numerous DNA and RNA viruses

56-58

. Selective

modulation of the cGAS-STING pathways may allow SARS-CoV-2 to promote an NF-κB
mediated cell survival signal while limiting ISG induction.
Classical cGAS-STING induction activates not only NF-κB, but also TBK1 and IRF3
pathways. We envisage several mechanisms that could contribute to the selective NF-κB
activation. First, the virus could actively block TBK1 activation in infected cells. Indeed,
protein interaction studies indicate that viral NSP13 and NSP15 proteins interact with TBK1 or
its adaptor proteins

34

. Additionally, a block in TBK1 activation has been reported for both

SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infections and early reports demonstrate a lack of TBK1
phosphorylation in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells

29,59

. Moreover, our results support a model

where SARS-CoV-2 infection prevents activated STING from translocating from the ER to the
Golgi. Activation of STING at the ER has been shown to be sufficient for NF-κB activation but
not for TBK1 activation and the subsequent IRF3 phosphorylation

40,60

. It may be that

fragmentation of the Golgi by SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to an impairment of STING
translocation to the ERGIC. Consistently, our transcriptomic analysis shows impairment in
protein secretion pathways, specifically including downregulation of several COP coatomer
proteins involved in ER to Golgi transport. Alternatively, SARS-CoV-2 proteins could actively
block cGAS-STING translocation. Colocalization between STING and N protein in infected
cells suggests a direct role for N protein in limiting STING translocation. A similar mechanism
has been suggested for murine cytomegalovirus, where viral m152 protein associates with
STING and limits exit from the ER, thereby promoting an NF-κB specific response.
Interestingly, pathway analysis of our microarray data indicate that cytokine transcriptional
responses from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells resemble signatures from human cytomegalovirus
infected cells. Further experimentation is required to define the precise mechanisms of STING
activation in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and to determine whether viral proteins are directly
associating with components of the cGAS-STING pathway.

The majority of documented SARS-CoV-2 infections lead to mild or no symptoms,
indicating that even the observed low level of antiviral pathway activation induced by infected
cells can be sufficient to limit and resolve the infection. On the other hand, in patients with
underlying conditions or attenuated immune responses, these antiviral responses do not limit
virus replication and a sustained virus load eventually leads to a long term inflammatory
response. In these latter cases, one important avenue of treatment is to modulate the immune
response in order to alleviate hyper-inflammation. In addition to other immune modulators that
are currently being used or clinically evaluated (eg. IL-6 inhibitors or corticosteroids)61-65, our
results indicate that disease severity might be suppressed at the epithelial cell level through the
use of cGAS-STING inhibitors or through blocking NF-κB mediated inflammatory responses.
In this respect, NF-κB inhibitors analogous to CAPE or parthenolide, prolonging survival of
SARS-CoV-1 infected mice 44, might help to reduce the disease burden imposed by COVID19.

Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions and viruses
A549 and Calu-3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM)
supplemented with Glutamax (Gibco),10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U penicillin/ml, 100 µg
streptomycin/ml, 2 mM L-glutamine and nonessential amino acids. A549 cells stably
expressing ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 reporter construct were created by lentivirus
transduction. To produce lentivirus particles, HEK-293T cells were transfected with pCMVGag-Pol, pMD2-VSV-G (kind gifts from Didier Trono, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland) and a
pWPI vector encoding the gene of interest. Transfections were done using polyethylenimine
and lentivirus particles were harvested and filtered through a 0.45 µm pore-size filter. A549
cells were inoculated with the viral supernatant overnight and next day antibiotic selections
were applied. Neomycin (500 µg/ml) and Puromycin (2 µg/ml) antibiotics were used for ACE2
and SARS-CoV-2 reporter expressions, respectively. Viruses used are SARS-CoV-2BavPat1/2020 strain (kindly provided by Christian Drosten through the European Virus
Archive), ZIKV H/PF/2013 (GenBank accession number KJ776791.2), IAV A/WSN/1933
(H1N1; kindly provided by Martin Schwemmle, University of Freiburg) and SeV (kindly
provided by Rainer Zawatzky, German Cancer Research Center).
SARS-CoV-2 virus stock production
SARS-CoV-2 stocks were produced using VeroE6 cell line. Passage 2 BavPat1/2020 (MOI:
0.01) strain was used to generate the seed virus (passage 3). After 48 h the supernatant was
harvested, cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 1,000xg for 5 min and supernatant
filtered with a 0.45 mm pore-size filter. Passage 4 virus stocks were produced by using 500 µl
of the seed virus (passage 3) to infect 9E+06 VeroE6 cells. The resulting supernatant was
harvested, filtered 48 h later as described above and stored in aliquots at -80°C. Stock virus
titers were determined by plaque assay.

RNA isolation and RT-qPCR
Total RNA was isolated from cells or supernatants using the NucleoSpin RNA extraction kit
(Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer’s specification. cDNA was synthesized from
the total RNA using the high capacity cDNA reverse transcription (RT) kit (ThermoScientific)
according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Each cDNA sample was diluted 1:15 in nuclease
free H2O prior to qPCR analysis using specific primers and the iTaq Universal SYBR green
mastermix (Bio-Rad). Primers for qPCR were designed using Primer3 software and include:

from each sample, cycle threshold (ct) values were corrected for the PCR efficiency of the
specific primer set, and normalized to hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT)
transcript levels.
For microarray chip analysis total RNA was extracted from cells and hybridized on an
Affymetrix Clariom S human array performed by the Microarray Unit of the Genomics and
Proteomics Core Facility at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ). Labeling was done
using the Thermo Fisher Scientific (Affymetrix) Gene Chip WT PLUS Reagent to generate

Expression Microarrays were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip® Scanner 3000
according to GeneChip® Expression Wash, Stain and Scan Manual for Cartridge Arrays
Data analysis for microarray
Raw, analyzed and meta data as well as the code used during analysis are available upon
request.
First, data was collected for all samples after Robust Multi-Array Average (RMA)
quantile normalization with R using the function ‘normalize.quantiles’ from Bioconductor
package "preprocessCore" for probe set equalization. Second, data was then log transformed
and PCA including all samples was performed using R/prcomp (R version 4.0.0). The rotation
for each sample is shown. After PCA quality control and check for equal distribution of logtransformed probe intensities, data was gathered and time points were pooled as ‘early’ (4h and
8 h time point) or ‘late’ (12 h and 24 h). R/limma’s lmFit, eBayes and topTable functions were
then used with a model “matrix of expression ~ treatment + time” (limma version 3.40.6,66), to
estimate base mean expression and differential expression for the contrast infected vs mock
treatment. This analysis was performed individually for each cell line as differences between
the lines would have obscured a model by driving the variance, as apparent in the PCA analysis.
R/limma’s topTable function employs Benjamini Hochberg correction for multiple testing on
all p-values. Genes were called significant if their adjusted p-value was smaller than 0.1 (False
Discovery Rate, FDR < 10%).
Gene set enrichment analysis was performed according to Subramanian et al. 67. We use the
practical R implementation “fgsea” 68 and the hallmark pathway gene set published by Liberzon
et al. 69. The barcode plot implementation was inspired by Zhan et al.70.

Fluoromount G solution containing DAPI (Southern biotech) for DNA staining. Microscopic
analyses were conducted with a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope (Nikon, Tokio, Japan) or a Leica
SP8 confocal microscope (Leica) for the subcellular localization analyses.
For quantification of the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65/RELA or IRF3, nuclei
were segmented using DAPI signal first. Secondly, the segmented nucleus was dilated and
finally dilated nucleus was subtracted by original nucleus mask to detect perinuclear fluorescent
signal. To determine SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, dsRNA intensity was measured within the
perinuclear area. The status of NF-κB or IRF3 nuclear signals was determined based on the
ration between perinuclear intensity divided by nuclear intensity.
Interferon treatment
For pretreatment experiments, cells were treated for 6 h with serial dilution of IFNα2
(PBL Assay Science, 11100-1), IFNβ (R&D Systems, 8499-IF-010/CF), IFNλ1 (Peprotech,
300-02L-100) or IFNγ (R&D Systems, 285-IF/CF) in normal cell growth media. The 50 percent
effective concentration (EC50) values for ISG activation were determined using RT-qPCR or
from the data sheet (for IFNγ) and IFN dilutions were started at 100 times the EC50 value. For
pre-, co-, and post-treatment with IFNs, cells were treated with each IFN at 10 times the EC50
concentration of each IFN. For all IFN treatments, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
at 16 h post infection, followed by immunofluorescence staining as describe above. Cells were
imaged using a Nikon Eclipse Ti2-E inverted fluorescent microscope. In order to determine the
percentage of infected cells, we first segmented single cells, and secondly, calculated the mean
signal intensity value of dsRNA from SARS-CoV-2 located in the perinuclear region of
segmented single cells. Fluorescent signal intensity values of dsRNA were quantified using the
EBImage platform in R-Studio71. Finally, percent infected cells was determined by establishing
a threshold for the background fluorescent signal intensity of non-infected cells and quantifying
the number of cells that exceeded this threshold in a given field of view.

Poly(I:C) and herring DNA transfection
For Calu-3 cell stimulation (Fig. 4a,b) cells were transfected with the indicated amount
of poly(I:C) using lipofectamine 2000 reagent as per the manufacturer’s protocol. 16 h after
transfection, total RNA was isolated and RT-qPCR was used to determine transcript levels as
describe above.
For transfection in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (Fig. 5 and extended data Fig. 3), cells
seeded in 24-well plates were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI=5 for 6 h. Cells were then
transfected with poly(I:C) or herring DNA (500ng/well) using lipofectamine 2000 reagent as
per the manufacturer’s protocol. 6 h after transfection, cells were either fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde and processed for immunofluorescence, or total RNA was isolated for RTqPCR analysis as described above.
Western blot analysis and imaging
Infected and mock cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 100 µl of sample buffer (120
mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 60 mM SDS, 100 mM DTT, 1.75% glycerol, 0.1% bromophenol blue)
supplied with 1 µl of benzonase (Milipore: 70746-3) to remove contaminating nucleic acids.
Denaturation of the samples was achieved by incubation at 95°C for 3 min. After SDS-PAGE,
proteins were blotted onto PVDF (polyvinylidenfluorid) membranes and blocking was done
with 3% (w/v) BSA in Tris- buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes
were incubated with primary antibodies (Extended Data Table 1), diluted in 3% BSA in TBS,
for 1 h and washed three times for 10 min each with TBS-T (TBS supplied with 0.1% Tween
20). Horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were diluted in 5% (w/v)
milk in TBS-T and membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three
times with TBS-T for 10 min, membranes were developed with the Western Lightning PlusECL reagent (Perkin Elmer: NEL105001EA). A ChemoCam Imager 3.2 (Intas Science Imaging
Instruments GmbH, Göttingen, Germany) was used to visualize the signals that were quantified
using the ImageJ (FiJi) software package.

Plaque assay and CPE assay
2.5E+06 VeroE6 cells were seeded into each well of a 24-well plate. On the next day, cells
were infected with serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h. Afterwards inoculum was removed
and replaced with serum-free DMEM containing 0.8% carboxymethylcellulose. At 72 h post
infection, cells were fixed with 5% formaldehyde for 1 h followed by staining with 1% crystal
violet solution. Plaque forming units per ml (PFU/ml) were calculated by manual counting of
the viral plaques.
For cytopathic effect (CPE) assays, Calu-3 or A549-ACE2 cells were plated into 96
well plates. Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 48 h followed by fixation in 5%
formaldehyde for 1 h. Cells were then stained with 1% crystal violet solution and scanned.
Cytokine profiling of patient samples
Patient sera were collected and stored at -80°C until cytokine measurement.
Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid BALF specimens and tracheal secretions (TS) were collected
during medically-indicated, routine bronchoscopies in mechanically ventilated COVID-19
patients using a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope. BAL-samples were obtained by instillation
of a pre-warmed 0.9% sterile saline solution (20 mL twice). The sampling area was determined
based on the localization of lesion on chest imaging (X-ray or computed tomography scan). All
material was obtained after approval by the by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty
Heidelberg (number S-148/2020) medical ethics committee of the University of Heidelberg,
written consent was obtained from all patients prior to analysis.
Blood, BALF and TS samples were evaluated for cytokine for cytokine levels and
compared to the cytokine profiles secreted from infected culture cells. Serum was separated
from clotted blood fraction by centrifugation at 1500xg for 10 min at 4°C. BALF and TS were
filtered through a 100 µm cell strainer (Falcon Corning, USA) then centrifuged at 500xg 10

Calu-3 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI=1). At the indicated times after infection
samples were harvested for analysis of intra- and extra-cellular viral RNA (a-b), titer of
infectious virus released into culture supernatant (c) and percent infected cells (d-e). a-b, Total
cellular RNA was isolated from supernatants or cells at the given time points and virus RNA
levels were determined using RT-qPCR with ORF1a specific primers detecting only the viral
RNA genome, but not subgenomic mRNAs. Graphs show the average fold change and SEM
for each time point compared to the 2 h time point. Intracellular viral RNA levels were corrected
for total cell numbers using HPRT as a standard. c, Infectious virus titers were determined using
a PFU assay; graph shows the mean and SEM PFU/mL for each time point. d, Infected cells
were fixed in 4% PFA followed by staining with antibodies specific for dsRNA. Representative
images of one out of 3 independent time series are shown. e, The percentage of infected cells
at each time point was determined based on dsRNA staining. Graphs show the average percent
infection and SEM over 3 independent experiments (N>1000 cells counted per experiment).

Fig. 2 | Transcriptional changes induced upon SARS-CoV-2 infection over time.
a-b, A549-ACE2 cells or Calu-3 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2. At the indicated time
points after infection, total RNA was harvested and mRNA transcript levels were determined
by Illumina microarray. Probe intensities were quantile normalized using probe-wise
normalization. Normalized probe intensities were averaged for each gene and log-transformed.
Differential expression was then called using a standard R/limma workflow for microarray
analysis. MA-plots and Volcano-plots of transcriptional changes in Calu-3 cells (a) or A549ACE2 cells (b) highlighting differentially expressed genes. Blue dots represent significant
changes as determined by R/limma with a Benjamini Hochberg adjusted p-value smaller than
0.1. Left plot (MA-plot) shows log2 fold change on the y-axis vs mean normalized expression
on the x-axis. Right plot (volcano-plot) shows the significant hits considering both infection
and changes over time (x-axis = log2 fold change; y-axis = -log10 p-value; top 15 significant
genes marked). c. Heat map of log scaled relative expression of enriched genes in Calu-3 cells.
d, Gene set enrichment analysis employing the MSigDB collection of Hallmark pathways for

Fig. | 3. Cytokine profiles in various samples of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and cells.
a-d, Serum, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and tracheal secretion samples were taken from
patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms. Samples were inactivated by treatment with betapropiolactone that retains antigenicity. The cytokine profiles were determined using Extended
Bio-Plex Pro Human Cytokine Panel (a-c) or LEGENDplex antiviral response panel (d) from
LGENDplex. Graphs show the mean concentration for each cytokine (pg/mL) detected in the
various patient samples. Each dot represents one patient sample. N.D., not detected. e, Calu-3
cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2. At 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h post infection, cell
culture supernatants were harvested from mock cells and infected cells, treated with betapropiolactone and cytokine profiles were determined by flow cytometry using the LGENDplex
antiviral response panel. Values obtained for each infected sample were corrected for the
corresponding value of the mock sample. Graph shows the mean and SEM of fold change for
each cytokine compared to mock sample at each time point.

Fig. 4 | Innate cytokine response in lung epithelial cell lines and time-dependent inhibition
of SARS-CoV-2 by IFN. a, Calu-3 cells were transfected with different concentrations of
dsRNA or infected with influenza virus (FLUAV) or sendai virus (SeV) to activate the innate
cytokine response. Total RNA was isolated from cells and the level of IFIT1 or IFNβ mRNA
transcripts was determined by RT-qPCR. Graphs show the average and SEM for 3 independent
experiments. b-c, Wild-type A549 or A549-ACE2 cells were infected with ZIKV or SARSCoV-2 for the indicated time. Levels of viral RNA and immune gene transcripts were
determined by RT-qPCR using specific primers. The graph in (b) shows the mean viral RNA
levels compared to human HPRT levels for 3 independent experiments. The graph in (c) shows
the mean fold change compared to uninfected cells for 3 independent experiments. d, Calu-3 or
A549-ACE2 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of different IFNs starting with
the highest concentration of 100X the EC50 value (determined for ISG activation by qPCR) for
each IFN. 6 h post treatment cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI=5) and 16 h thereafter
cells were fixed in formaldehyde followed by staining with antibodies against dsRNA. The
percent of infected cells was determined for each well. Graphs show the average fold change
and SEM compared to untreated cells for 3 independent experiments. e, Experimental setup
used for pre-, co-, and post-treatment of cells with IFN. f, Cells were treated with IFN for 6 h
prior to infection (pre-treatment), or treated with IFN starting at the time of virus inoculation
(co-treatment) or treated with IFN 6 h post infection (highest concentration of each IFN
corresponds to 10X EC50 -determined for ISG activation by qPCR). 16 h post infection cells
were fixed, and the percent infected cells was determined by immunofluorescence using dsRNA
specific antibodies. Graph show the average fold change and SEM compared to untreated cells
for 3 independent experiments.
