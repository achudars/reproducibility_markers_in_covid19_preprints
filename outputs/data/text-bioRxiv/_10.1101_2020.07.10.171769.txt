ABSTRACT
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly pathogenic virus that
has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Tracing the evolution and transmission of the virus
is crucial to respond to and control the pandemic through appropriate intervention strategies. This
paper reports and analyses genomic mutations in the coding regions of SARS-CoV-2 and their
probable protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility changes, which are predicted using
deep learning models. Prediction results suggest that mutation D614G in the virus spike protein,
which has attracted much attention from researchers, is unlikely to make changes in protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility. Based on 6,324 viral genome sequences, we
create a spreadsheet dataset of point mutations that can facilitate the investigation of SARS-CoV-2
in many perspectives, especially in tracing the evolution and worldwide spread of the virus. Our
analysis results also show that coding genes E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF10 are most
stable, potentially suitable to be targeted for vaccine and drug development.

INTRODUCTION
Biological investigations of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 are important to understand the
virus and help to propose appropriate responses to the pandemic. Scientists have been able to ob-

tain genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and have started analysis of these data. Reference genome
of SARS-CoV-2 deposited to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank
sequence database (isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, accession number NC_045512) shows that SARS-CoV2 is an RNA virus having a length of 29,903 nucleotides. Comparative genomic analysis results
obtained in 1,2,3 suggest that the COVID-19 virus may be originated in bats. Other studies show
that pangolins may have served as the hosts for the virus 4,5 . Andersen et al. 6 furthermore believe
that SARS-CoV-2 is not a purposefully manipulated virus or constructed in a laboratory but has a
natural origin. A study in 7 using machine learning unsupervised clustering methods corroborates
previous findings that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Sarbecovirus subgenus of the Betacoronavirus
genus within the Coronaviridae family 8,9 . The whole genome analysis results also indicate that
bats are more likely the reservoir hosts for the virus than pangolins. Another study in 10 demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 may have resulted from a recombination of a pangolin coronavirus and a
bat coronavirus, and pangolins may have acted as an intermediate host for the virus.
Since the first cases were detected, the COVID-19 virus has spread to almost every country in
the world and has been linked to the deaths of more than 404,000 people of over 7 million confirmed cases 11 . Tracing the evolution and spread of the virus is important for developing vaccines
and drugs as well as proposing appropriate intervention strategies. Monitoring and analysing the
viral genome mutations can be helpful for this task. Due to a strong immunologic pressure in
humans, the virus may have mutated over time to circumvent responses of the human immune
system. This leads to the creation of virus variants with possible different virulence, infectivity,
and transmissibility 12 . This paper reports all point mutations occurring so far in SARS-CoV-2
and presents exemplified implications obtained from the analysis of these mutation pattern data.
Four types of mutations, which include synonymous, nonsynonymous, insertion and deletion, are
detected. We use 6,324 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences collected in 45 countries and deposited
to the NCBI GenBank so far and create a spreadsheet dataset of all mutations occurred across different genes. Eleven protein coding genes of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified, namely ORF1ab,
spike (S), ORF3a, envelope (E), membrane (M), ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, nucleocapsid (N)
and ORF10. The order of these genes and their corresponding length are illustrated in Fig. 1.
The genes S, E, M, and N produce structural proteins that play important roles in the virus functions. For example, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) region of the S protein can bind to a
receptor of a host cell, e.g. the human and bat angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor,
enabling the entrance of the virus into the cell 13 . Predictions of protein structures may help understand the virus’s functions and thus contribute to developing vaccines and therapeutics against the
virus. In this paper, to evaluate the possible impacts of genomic mutations on the virus functions,
we propose the use of the SSpro/ACCpro 5 methods to predict protein secondary structure and
relative solvent accessibility 14 . These predictors were built using deep learning one-dimensional
bidirectional recurrent neural networks incorporated in the SCRATCH-1D software suite (version

1.2, 2018) 15 . By comparing the prediction results obtained on the reference genome and mutated
genomes, we are able to assess whether the detected mutations have the potential to change the
protein structure and solvent accessibility, and thus lead to possible changes of the virus characteristics. Because of the functional importance of structural proteins, we only report the prediction
results of these proteins in this study. The next section reviews related works in the literature. We
then present materials and methods for SARS-CoV-2 mutation detection, and protein secondary
structure and solvent accessibility prediction. Next we summarize statistics of SARS-CoV-2 mutations so far and implications of these mutations. Details of mutations in nonstructural ORF genes
and structural S, E, M and N genes are presented after that. A full SARS-CoV-2 mutation spreadsheet report is provided in the Data Availability section.
RELATED WORKS
Since the first genomes were collected in December 2019, there have been many findings on
the mutations of SARS-CoV-2. For example, Phan 16 analysed 86 genomes of SARS-CoV-2
downloaded from the the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database
(https://www.gisaid.org/) and found 93 mutations over the entire viral genome sequences. Among
them, there are three mutations occurring in the RBD region of the spike surface glycoprotein S,
including N354D, D364Y and V367F, with the numbers showing amino acid (AA) positions in
the protein. That study also reveals three deletions in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from
Japan, USA and Australia. Two of these deletion mutations are in the ORF1ab polyprotein and one
deletion occurs in the 3’ end of the genome. Likewise, a study in 17 shows that the SARS-CoV-2
genomes may have undergone recurrent, independent mutations at 198 sites with 80% of these are
of the nonsynonymous type. Alternatively, a SNP genotyping study in 18 discovered highly frequent
mutations in the genes encoding the S protein, RNA polymerase, RNA primase, and nucleoprotein.
Those high-frequency SNP mutations are worth further investigations for vaccine development because they may be linked to the virus transmissibility and virulence. Tang et al. 19 investigated 103
genomes of COVID-19 patients and discover mutations in 149 sites of these genomes. The study
also shows that the spike gene S consistently has larger dS values (synonymous substitutions per

synonymous site) than other genes. In addition, two major lineages of the virus, denoted as L and
S, have been specified based on two tightly linked SNPs. The L lineage is found more prevalent
than the S lineage among the examined sequences.
Korber et al. 20 tracked the mutations of spike protein S of SARS-CoV-2 because it plays an important role in mediating infection of targeted cells and is the focus of vaccine and antibody therapy
development efforts 21 . They detected 14 mutations in the spike protein that are growing, especially
the mutation D614G that rapidly becomes the dominant form when spread to a new geographical
region. Likewise, Hashimi 22 analysed the mutation frequency in the spike protein S of 796 SARSCoV-2 genomes downloaded from the GISAID and GenBank databases. The study found 64 mutations occurring in the S protein sequences obtained from multiple countries. It suggests that the
virus is spreading in two forms, the D614 form (residue D at position 614 in the S protein) takes
68.5% while the G614 form takes 31.5% proportion of the examined isolates. Koyama et al. 23
on the other hand found several variants of SARS-CoV-2 that may cause drifts and escape from
immune recognition by using the prediction results of B-cell and T-cell epitopes in 24 . Typically,
the mutation D614G occurring in the spike protein is found prevalent in the European population.
This mutation may have caused antigenic drift, resulting in vaccine mismatches that lead to a high
mortality rate of this population.
A recent situation report 25 by Nextstrain 26 on genomic epidemiology of novel coronavirus using 5,193 publicly shared COVID-19 genomes shows that SARS-CoV-2 on average accumulates
changes at a rate of 24 substitutions per year. This is approximately equivalent to 1 mutation per
1,000 bases in a year. This evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2 is typical for a coronavirus, and it
is smaller than that of influenza (average 2 mutations per 1,000 bases per year) and HIV (average
4 mutations per 1,000 bases per year). Shen et al. 12 conducted metatranscriptome sequencing for
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples obtained from 8 patients with COVID-19 and found no evidence for the transmission of intrahost variants as well as a high evolution rate of the virus with the
number of intrahost variants ranged from 0 to 51 around a median number of 4. Pachetti et al. 27
examined 220 genomic sequences of COVID-19 patients from the GISAID database and discovered 8 novel recurrent mutations at nucleotide locations 1397, 2891, 14408, 17746, 17857, 18060,
23403 and 28881. Mutations at locations 2891, 3036, 14408, 23403 and 28881 are mostly found
in Europe while those at locations 17746, 17857 and 18060 occur in sequences obtained from patients in North America. Likewise, a study in 28 on 95 SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences
discovered 116 mutations. Among them, the mutations at position C8782T in the ORF1ab gene,
T28144C in the ORF8 gene and C29095T in the N gene are common.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Detection
We use 6,324 sequence records downloaded from the NCBI GenBank database on 2020-06-17.
The latest collection date for the samples from which the sequences were derived was on 202006-05. The data, which were collected in 45 countries, include both nucleotide sequences and
protein translations of coding genes. A proportion of the 6,324 records have sequences of only
few proteins, i.e. these records do not annotate all 11 proteins (ORF1ab, ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a,
ORF7b, ORF8, ORF10, S, E, M and N). The number of available sequences is thus different from
one protein to another (see column "Avai Num" in Table 1). Genome sequences that do not specify country or AA sequences that contain letter "X" representing an unknown AA are excluded
in our calculations. We use the genome obtained from the isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, accession number
NC_045512 as the reference genome. For the mutation detection purpose, we apply a dynamic programming algorithm to protein AA sequences to get global pairwise alignments between a reference sequence and a query sequence. Specifically, we use the Python Bio.pairwise2.align.globalms
function (https://biopython.org/docs/dev/api/Bio.pairwise2.html) where a match is given 2 points,
a mismatch is deducted 0.5 points, 2 points are deducted when opening a gap, and 1 point is
deducted when extending it. Gaps are then inserted into nucleotide sequences corresponding to
the resulted protein sequence alignments. Using the resulted pairwise alignments, we are able to
compare query sequences and the reference sequences at each position and identify locations of
insertion, deletion, synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations.
Secondary Structure and Solvent Accessibility Prediction
Virus protein structure plays a key role in its functions and a change in structure shape may affect its
functions, virulence, infectivity and transmissibility, possibly resulting in non-functional proteins.
Protein secondary structure is defined by hydrogen bonding patterns, which make an intermediate
form before the protein folds into a three-dimensional shape composing its tertiary structure. Eight
types of protein secondary structure defined by the Dictionary of Protein Secondary Structure
(DSSP) include 310 helix (G), α helix (H), π helix (I), hydrogen bonded turn (T), extended strand
in parallel and/or anti-parallel β-sheet conformation (E), residue in isolated β-bridge (B), bend (S)
and coil (C). The DSSP tool assigns every residue to one of the eight possible states. In a reduced
form, these 8 conformational states can be diminished to 3 states: H = {H, G, I}, E = {E, B} and
C = {S, T, C} 29 . The protein secondary structure represents interactions between neighboring or
near-by AAs as its functional three-dimensional shape is created through the polypeptide folding.
We thus determine a change in protein secondary structure if any change happens in the structures
of the mutated AA and its 10 neighboring AAs compared to those of the reference sequence.
In detail, we consider 5 AAs ahead and 5 AAs behind the mutated AA. The same approach is
applied when considering a change of the protein relative solvent accessibility. Solvent-exposed
area represents the area of a biomolecule on a surface that is accessible to a solvent. Accordingly, a
residue is considered as exposed if at least 25% of that residue must be exposed, denoted as the "e"

state. Alternatively, the residue is determined as buried, i.e. the "b" state. There have been various
protein secondary structure prediction programs in the literature and many of those were developed
based on artificial intelligence models using protein AA sequences such as JPred4 30 , Spider2 31 ,
Porter 5 32 , RaptorX 33 , PSSpred 34 , YASSPP 35 and SSpro 14 . In this paper, we use the protein
secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility prediction methods SSpro/ACCpro 5 14 within
the SCRATCH-1D software suite (release 1.2, 2018) 15 . These predictors were built using the
bidirectional recursive neural networks and a combination of the sequence similarity and sequencebased structural similarity to sequences in the Protein Data Bank 36 . Prediction results of 8-class
structure (SSpro8 predictor) and 25%-threshold relative solvent accessibility (ACCpro predictor)
are used for statistics on protein secondary structure and accessibility changes. We however also
report in the spreadsheet supplemental information prediction results of 3-class structure (SSpro
predictor) and relative solvent accessibility on 20 thresholds, ranging from 0% to 95% with a 5%
step (the ACCpro20 predictor within the SCRATCH-1D software).
SUMMARY OF SARS-COV-2 MUTATIONS
Table 1 summarizes statistics of SARS-CoV-2 mutations so far. "AA Length" indicates the length
of the protein AA sequence derived from the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. "Avai. Num" denotes the number of records among 6,324 NCBI GenBank records that have the complete sequence
of the corresponding protein. "No. Mu" refers to the number of sequences that do not have any
mutations compared to the reference sequence. "No. Mu Rate" is the ratio between "No. Mu" and
"Avai. Num". "Delete" means the number of deletion mutations occurring in the AA sequences
of the protein. This number may be larger than the number of sequences having deletion mutations because an AA sequence may have more than one deletion. Likewise, "Insert", "Nonsyn"
and "Syn" show the number of insertion, nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations occurring in
the protein AA sequences. "Nonsyn/Syn" demonstrates a ratio between the number of nonsynonymous mutations versus the number of synonymous mutations. "Struct Change" means the number
of nonsynonymous mutations that have protein secondary structure change potential based on the
SSpro8 predictor of the SCRATCH-1D software. Similarly, "Acc Change" refers to the number of
nonsynonymous mutations that have potential to change the protein relative solvent accessibility
based on the ACCpro predictor of the SCRATCH-1D software. Insertion and deletion mutations
alter protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility by default so that they are not included
in the structure and solvent accessibility change statistics.

Table 1 shows that the ORF3a and ORF8 proteins have the number of nonsynonymous mutations
significantly larger than that of the synonymous mutations. In contrast, this ratio in proteins E, M,
ORF7b and ORF10 are very small (less than 1). These proteins could be targeted for vaccine and
drug development as they have less variations than other proteins. These findings are supported by
results presented in Figs. 2-4 where we plot the number of insertion, deletion and nonsynonymous

mutations against different locations in the proteins. A spike in these figures demonstrates a large
number of insertion, deletion and nonsynonymous mutations. Regions between spikes are stable
and can be useful for further research for vaccine and drug development. For example, in protein
ORF1ab (Fig. 2), regions [1...264], [266...3605], [3607...4714], [4716...5827], [5829...5864] and
[5866...7096] are relatively stable. In protein S (Fig. 3), entire regions before and after the spike
at position 614 are almost unchanged. Fig. 4 presents variations of multiple proteins. In addition
to proteins E, M, ORF7b and ORF10, we find from Fig. 4 that proteins ORF6 and ORF7a are also
relatively stable without a large number of variations at any particular locations. This is justified by
data in the column "No. Mu Rate" in Table 1, which shows the ratio between "No. Mu" and "Avai.
Num", i.e. the ratio between the number of sequences having no mutations in a specific protein
versus the total number of available sequences of that protein. Proteins E, M, ORF6, ORF7a,
ORF7b and ORF10 have a large number of sequences with no mutations, therefore their ratios are
very large, respectively of 0.98, 0.90, 0.98, 0.97, 0.99, and 0.99. This is because the size of these
proteins is relatively small (see data in the column "AA Length" in Table 1). These proteins are
considered as most stable when compared to other proteins, which have the ratios of less than 0.8.
These results are consistent with the data shown in Fig. 2-4.
Protein N has 1,927 nonsynonymous mutations but 1,678 of them are likely to make changes in
protein secondary structure, making a ratio of 87.08%. This is considerably larger than those of
protein S (4.42%), protein M (24.79%) and protein E (64.29%). The number of solvent accessibility changes of protein S is larger than its structure changes: 184 vs 164. This however is opposite
in other structural proteins: E (7 vs 18), M (8 vs 30) and N (37 vs 1,678).

DETAILS OF MUTATIONS IN NONSTRUCTURAL ORF GENES
Gene ORF1ab
The ORF1ab polyprotein has 7,096 AAs. Among 6,324 records deposited to the NCBI GenBank
database, only 3,726 genomes have the complete coding sequence (CDS) of protein ORF1ab,
with 1,024 unique AA sequences. This is quite a large number compared to other proteins but
understandable because ORF1ab is the longest protein of SARS-CoV-2 and thus has a large number
of variations. Only 119 sequences have no mutation or synonymous mutations while the rest 3,607
sequences have insertion, deletion or nonsynonymous mutations. There are two distinct insertion
mutations -3603F and -7041F occurring in six different sequences. The insertion -3603F occurs
in five sequences: MT507793 (collected in Jamaica on 2020-03-11), MT614545 (USA: NY on
2020-03-16), MT451423 (Australia: Victoria on 2020-03-28), MT451433 (Australia: Victoria on
2020-03-29) and MT451522 (Australia: Victoria on 2020-03-30). The insertion -7041F occurs
only in MT188341, collected in USA: MN on 2020-03-05. There are total 170 deletion mutations,
with 48 distinct deletions. Deletions occurring in 10 or more sequences are reported in Table 2.
Fig. 5 shows an alignment of sequences having a large number of deletions in the ORF1ab protein.
Alternatively, 8,330 nonsynonymous mutations are found, in which 1,067 mutations are distinct.
Table 3 presents common nonsynonymous mutations (those occurring in 50 or more sequences)
in the ORF1ab protein. Details of other mutations are reported in the spreadsheet dataset in the
Data Availability section. Notable mutations are P4715L occurring in 2,576 sequences and T265I
occurring in 1,344 sequences.

isolate names and collected dates are on the right. The numbers on top show the positions of AAs in the protein and
isolates are ordered by collected dates. The first isolate having these deletions is USA-CA6/2020 (record MT044258
in second row), collected on 2020-01-27 in USA: CA. This is also the isolate having the largest number of deletions:
five sequentially at G82-, H83-, V84-, M85-, V86- and three at K141-, S142-, F143-. The other patients followed were
possibly infected by this first case but more data such as travel history are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

total of 3,400 nonsynonymous mutations (125 unique) are found in the ORF3a protein. Nonsynonymous mutations occur in 10 or more sequences are reported in Table 4. Notably, the mutation
Q57H occurs in 2,795 sequences collected in many countries. This is an emerging and active mutation, which requires further investigation as the latest case of this mutation was on 2020-06-05,
same as the latest collection date of the entire downloaded dataset. The mutation G251V occurring
in 206 sequences is also a prevalent mutation in the ORF3a protein.

Gene ORF6
The ORF6 protein has 61 AAs, appearing in 5,792 isolates with 25 unique AA sequences. Among
these, 5,719 sequences have no mutation or only synonymous mutations and 73 sequences have insertion, deletion or nonsynonymous mutations. Two insertion mutations occur in record MT520188
at positions -62R and -63T (end of the sequence). Nine continual deletions occur similarly in 2
sequences: MT547814 (collected in Hong Kong on 2020-01-22 from an adult male patient 37 ) and
MT609561 (USA: Virginia in 2020-04). These deletions are F22-, K23-, V24-, S25-, I26-, W27-,
N28-, L29- and D30-. Alignment of these sequences with the reference genome is displayed in
Fig. 6. The isolate MT547814 thus may have transmitted the virus to MT609561 but this implication needs to be corroborated by patients’ travel history. There are 23 distinct nonsynonymous
mutations and those occurring in 2 or more sequences are presented in Table 5.

and N679-. Sequences MT474127 and MT460124 (both collected in USA: CA on 2020-03-27 and
2020-04-28, respectively) similarly have four deletions L141-, G142-, V143- and Y144-. The virus
transmission may have happened between these two isolates but this needs further investigation.
Alignment of these sequences is shown in Fig. 9.

Fig. 9. Deletions in protein S, which are all outside the RBD region (319-541), suggesting that the RBD may have
been evolutionarily optimized for the purpose of binding to a host cell. The numbers on top show the residue positions
in the protein. The GenBank accession numbers, collected dates and isolate names are presented on the left.

The number of nonsynonymous mutations in gene S is 3,711, with 240 distinct mutations. Mutations that occur in 10 or more cases are reported in Table 10. The number of synonymous mutations
is 670, making a ratio between nonsynonymous versus synonymous mutations at 5.54. Among
the nonsynonymous mutations, mutation D614G is extremely common as it happens in 3,089 sequences, majorly collected in USA (2340), India (210) and Australia (132). The first collected
date of the D614G mutation cannot be identified precisely because some sequences deposited to
the NCBI GenBank did not record the full date details. The current data show that either of the
following sequences, which have the D614G mutation, was first collected: MT326173 in USA in
2020, or MT270104, MT270105, MT270108 and MT270109 all in Germany: Bavaria in 2020-01,
or MT503006 in Thailand on 2020-01-04. It is however important to note that the first patient having the D614G mutation and his/her location may never be known because genome of that patient
might not be sequenced and reported. Therefore, information reported here can support for further
investigation.
On the other hand, there are 37 A829T mutations that all occur in Thailand. The first case of this
mutation was collected on 2020-01-23 and its latest case was on 2020-04-07. This may indicate
that the first case had probably transmitted to other cases having the same mutation A829T in
Thailand. Alternatively, mutations H146Y (24 cases), V483A (11 cases), E554D (14 cases), P681L
(16 cases) and S939F (11 cases) all occur only in USA or mutation L8V (4 cases) occurs only in
Hong Kong (refer to the spreadsheet data, which can be found in the Data Availability section).

We identify the RBD region within the residue range Arg319-Phe541 of protein S based on a
study in 38 . In the RBD region only, the number of nonsynonymous mutations is 53 and that of
synonymous is 46, making a ratio of 1.15. This is much smaller than the ratio of 5.54 for the entire
gene S, suggesting that the RBD region may have been optimized for binding to a receptor of a
host cell. This is complemented by Fig. 9 showing all deletion mutations in gene S being outside
the RBD region. Note that the difference of these ratios is partly due to the large number of D614G
mutations (3,089), which is outside the RBD region.
Table 11 summarizes nonsynonymous mutations in the RBD region occurring in 2 or more sequences. Notable mutation in this region is V483A occurring in 11 isolates all collected in USA.
The first and latest collected dates of these isolates were respectively 2020-03-05 and 2020-0405, suggesting that the first isolate may have spread to others having the same mutation V483A.
Likewise, the mutation G476S occurs in 6 isolates all collected in USA: WA from 2020-03-10 to
2020-03-25. Alternatively, the mutation Y453F occurs in 5 sequences all in Netherlands but the
first collected date was on 2020-04-25 and the latest collected date was on 2020-04-29. These dates
are too close, indicating that all the reported Y453F cases may have been infected from another
case, whose genome had not been sequenced and reported to the NCBI GenBank. It is important
to note that all the transmission implications need further investigation with more data from other
aspects such as travel history, physical contacts and so on.
In gene S, 164 nonsynonymous mutations (69 unique) are likely to make changes in protein secondary structure. In the RBD region, S477G [CBCTT(S)CCCCC -> CBCTT(S)CCCEC], P479L
[CTTSC(C)CCCCC -> CTTSC(C)CECCC], V483A [CCCCC(C)CTTTC -> CCCCC(C)CCTTC],
and F486L [CCCCT(T)TCBCS -> CCCEC(T)TCBCS] are four mutations having protein structure
change potential.
On the other hand, 184 nonsynonymous mutations (58 unique) have the relative solvent accessibility change potential. Of these, only three mutations are in the RBD region: V483A [eebbb(b)bebeb
-> eebbb(b)bbbeb], G485R [bbbbb(e)bebee -> bbbbb(b)bebee], and F486L [bbbbe(b)ebeeb ->
bbbbb(e)ebeeb]. Two mutations V483A and F486L are thus likely to make changes in both protein
secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility in the RBD region.
For the entire protein S, 134 nonsynonymous mutations (48 unique) have both structure and solvent
accessibility change potentials. These mutations occurring in 2 or more sequences are reported in
Table 12. Mutation H146Y occurs in 24 cases and mutation P681L occurs in 16 cases, which are
all collected in USA. The most common mutation D614G does not have the potential to change
either protein secondary structure or relative solvent accessibility.

Gene E
The envelope protein E has 75 AAs, found in 5,852 GenBank records with 15 unique AA sequences. Among them, 5,824 sequences have no mutation or only synonymous mutations while
28 sequences have nonsynonymous mutations. Gene E is thus relatively stable and could be targeted for vaccine and drug development. This is supported by the fact that no insertion or deletion
mutations are found within gene E. There are 14 distinct nonsynonymous mutations in gene E and
those occur in 2 or more sequences are presented in Table 13.
Five distinct nonsynonymous mutations in gene E have protein structure change potential: S68C,
S68F, P71L, D72Y and L73F. Alternatively, 4 distinct mutations have potential to change relative
solvent accessibility: L37H, L37R, D72Y and L73F. Therefore, D72Y and L73F are two mutations
in gene E that have a potential to change both protein structure and solvent accessibility.

Gene M
The M protein has 222 AAs and its complete CDS appears in 5,677 GenBank records, with 37
unique AA sequences. There are 5,557 sequences having no mutation or only synonymous mutations while other 120 sequences have nonsynonymous mutations. No insertion or deletion mutations are found in gene M. The number of distinct nonsynonymous mutations in gene M is 37, with
those occurring in 5 or more sequences shown in Table 14. Among these, 10 mutations are likely to
make changes in protein secondary structure: C64F, A69S, A69V, V70F, N113B, R158L, V170I,
D190N, D209Y and S214I. Alternatively, 6 mutations have the solvent accessibility change potential: N113B, P123L, P132S, H155Y, D190N and T208I. N113B and D190N are thus two mutations
having potential to change both protein structure and solvent accessibility in gene M.

gene N. The sequence in MT434815 (collected in USA: NY on 2020-03-09) has three sequential
deletions at Q390-, T391- and V392- while the sequence in MT370992 (USA: NY on 2020-0320) has six sequential deletions at T366-, E367-, P368-, K369-, K370- and D371-. Two other
sequences MT605818 and MT560525 (both collected in Turkey on 2020-04-16) have three sequential deletions at R195-, N196- and S197-. There are 1,927 nonsynonymous mutations with
156 distinct ones and those occurring in 10 or more sequences are presented in Table 15. Notable
mutations are R203K occurring in 871 sequences and G204R occurring in 433 sequences. There
are 15 mutations in this protein having the potential to change both protein structure and solvent
accessibility, including G18V, D22Y, G34W, R40C, R40L, R185C, A211S, P365H, T391I, T393I,
A398S, D399E, D399H, D401Y and D402Y.

DISCUSSIONS
The proposed analysis approach has been able to detect all point mutations so far of SARS-CoV-2
and report them in a spreadsheet dataset, which can be found in the Data Availability section. The
generated data can facilitate investigations about the virus in many perspectives. For example, using the mutations found, we can observe the possible virus transmissions between patients. This
is showcased through Figs. 5, 6 and 8 where similar mutations are detected from different isolates. In Fig. 5 for instance, a group of isolates have similar deletion mutations at positions M85-,
V86- or K141-, S142-, F143- in protein ORF1ab. Genome sequence of isolate USA-CA6/2020
collected in USA on 2020-01-27 is found to be the first having these consecutive mutations. There
could be a connection between this isolate with other isolates obtained in USA, Greece and Australia. Information presented in Tables 2-15 is extracted from the generated mutation data. In
these summary tables, "First Date" and "First Country" information is useful for identifying when
and where the mutations were possibly originated while the "Distribution" information shows how
such mutations have spread to different countries.
The generated mutation data also allow us to observe the evolution of the virus. We can point
out which mutations are still active or no longer active based on the "Latest Date" information
presented in Tables 2-15. For example, in gene S (Table 10), the latest date of D614G was on
2020-06-05 (same as the latest collection date of the entire genome dataset used in this study),
indicating that this mutation is still active. The latest date of P681L was on 2020-04-03, showing
that this mutation may no longer occur. Mutations are still active mean they have evolutionarily
adapted to varying environments while inactive mutations may have not. This kind of information
is useful for further research on vaccine and drug development as ongoing changes of the viral
proteins need to be focused and addressed rather than inactive mutations. Our analysis shows
that the G form at location 614 in protein S becomes increasingly popular compared to the D
form. Among 4,434 sequences of the S protein, 3,089 sequences have the mutation D614G, taking

69.67%. This number has considerably increased compared to 31.5% in the previous analysis in 22
on a dataset downloaded on 2020-03-22.
Through the mutation analysis, we are able to detect regions of the viral genomes that are stable
and can be targeted for vaccine and drug development, such as those coding for proteins E, M,
ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b and ORF10. In addition, this study presents results obtained by the use
of deep learning recurrent neural networks for protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility predictions. These results are useful for further research on SARS-CoV-2 protein structure
changes. In particular, among 3,089 D614G mutations, our prediction results show that none of
these mutations is likely to make changes in the protein secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility. This mutation has attracted much attention of researchers as it may affect the virulence
and infectivity of the virus and our finding has contributed to understanding this mutation.
CONCLUSIONS
Analysing the virus genome sequences and their proteins is crucial for understanding the virus and
proposing appropriate approaches to respond to and control the pandemic. This paper has reported
all point mutations of SARS-CoV-2 since the virus’s first genomes were obtained in December
2019. A SARS-CoV-2 mutation spreadsheet dataset is built using a large number of genome sequences (6,324) obtained across 45 countries. This dataset can enable scientists to monitor the
evolution and spread of the virus although the use of these data needs to be corroborated with
patients’ clinical data and travel history for substantiated confirmations. We also predict the secondary structure and relative solvent accessibility of the virus proteins to evaluate whether the
detected mutations have a potential to change the virus characteristics. The mutation D614G in
protein S is unlikely to change either protein secondary structure or relative solvent accessibility
based on the prediction results. These protein secondary structure and solvent accessibility change
potentials are predicted results based on deep learning recurrent neural networks, which need to
be experimentally verified. They however provide important insights about the virus and prompt
further experimental biochemistry and molecular biology research into the genomic regions of
these mutations. A future work focusing on impacts of the mutations on protein functions would
be worth investigating. The function impacts can be determined via wet lab experiments or using
low-cost computational tool such as PROVEAN 39 .
