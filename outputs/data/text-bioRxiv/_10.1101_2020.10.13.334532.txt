Abstract
COVID-19 is a spectrum of clinical symptoms in humans caused by infection with
SARS-CoV-2, a recently emerged coronavirus that has rapidly caused a pandemic.
Coalescence of a second wave of this virus with seasonal respiratory viruses,
particularly influenza virus is a possible global health concern. To investigate this,
transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor driven by the epithelial cell
cytokeratin-18 gene promoter (K18-hACE2) were first infected with IAV followed by
SARS-CoV-2. The host response and effect on virus biology was compared to K18hACE2 mice infected with IAV or SARS-CoV-2 only. Infection of mice with each
individual virus resulted in a disease phenotype compared to control mice. Although
SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis appeared significantly reduced in the sequentially
infected mice, these mice had a more rapid weight loss, more severe lung damage
and a prolongation of the innate response compared to singly infected or control mice.
The sequential infection also exacerbated the extrapulmonary manifestations
associated with SARS-CoV-2. This included a more severe encephalitis. Taken
together, the data suggest that the concept of ‘twinfection’ is deleterious and mitigation
steps should be instituted as part of a comprehensive public health response to the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction
Coronaviruses were once described as the backwater of virology but the last two
decades have seen the emergence of three major coronavirus threats 1. First, the
emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in China
in 2003. Second, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi
Arabia in 2012 and now SARS-CoV-2 originating in China in 2019. Whilst SARS-CoV
was eradicated both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 represent current ongoing health
threats, and a greater understanding is required to develop robust interventions for
future emergent coronaviruses. Coronaviruses share similar genome architectures
and disease profiles and generally cause respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses 1.
However, some animal/avian coronaviruses can also cause demyelination and
nephritis. The sheer scale of the COVID-19 outbreak has highlighted hitherto
unexpected aspects of coronavirus infection in humans, including long term disease
complications once the virus has been cleared.
Infection of humans with SARS-CoV-2 results in a range of clinical symptoms, from
asymptomatic to severe infection and subsequent death in both at risk individuals but
also a small proportion of otherwise healthy individuals across all age groups. Severe
infection in humans is typified by cytokine storms

2,3

, pneumonia and kidney failure.

Examination of post-mortem tissue reveals a disconnect between viral replication and
immune pathology 4. A range of other symptoms also occur, including gastrointestinal
symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and loss of appetite. A small
number of patients present without any overt respiratory symptoms at all. Typically,
patients with severe COVID-19 present to hospital in the second week of illness. There
is often a precipitous decline in respiratory function, without necessarily much in the
way of “air hunger.” Once intubated, these patients have unique ventilatory
characteristics, where they can be ventilated with relatively low inspired oxygen
concentrations but need high positive end expiratory pressures.
Respiratory infections in humans and animals can also be synergistic in which an initial
infection can exacerbate a secondary infection or vice versa. When multiple
pathogens are in circulation at the same time this can lead to cooperative or
competitive forms of pathogen-pathogen interactions 5. This was evident during the
1918 Spanish influenza A virus outbreak (IAV) where secondary bacterial pneumonia

was thought to be a leading cause of death 6. Co-infections in other viral diseases,
such as patients with Ebola virus disease, have also been shown to contribute to the
host response and outcome 7. As many countries move from a period of lock down
from the summer months the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely to increase
in frequency as is currently being witnessed in several European countries. The onset
of winter in the Northern Hemisphere has coincided with a second and possible
seasonal wave of SARS-CoV-2 that is likely to be co-incident with other respiratory
pathogens. In most temperate sites the usual seasonal respiratory coronavirus peak
occurs either slightly before or simultaneously with the IAV and influenza B virus
peaks, and this may occur with SARS-CoV-2. Generally, human coronaviruses display
winter seasonality between the months of December and April and are not detected
in summer months 8. This is a similar pattern seen with influenza viruses. Between 11
to 41% of patients with normal human coronavirus infection test positive for other
respiratory viruses 8. Our hypothesis was that co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV
could lead to co-infection, and if so, this may exacerbate clinical disease and
potentially outcome.
Previous work has shown co-infections are present in patients with severe coronavirus
infection. For SARS-CoV co-circulation of human metapneumovirus was reported in
an outbreak in Hong Kong. However, data suggested that outcomes were not different
between patients with identified co-infections and those with SARS-CoV alone 9. For
MERS-CoV, four cases of co-infection with influenza A virus were described, and
although no data was presented on the severity of symptoms this sample size would
be too small to generate any meaningful conclusions

10

. Post-mortem studies from

patients with COVID-19 in Beijing (n=85) identified IAV in 10% of patients, influenza B
virus in 5% of patients and 3% of patients had RSV, but the absence of a carefully
selected control arm prohibits conclusions to be drawn

11

. Recently there have been

several case reports of coinfections with IAV and SARS-CoV-2 in humans with severe
outcomes

12-17

with one study from the UK reporting that patients with a coinfection

exhibiting a ~6 times higher risk of death18. Whilst this suggests that coinfection is
synergistic, this study also found that the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 was
68% lower among individuals who were positive for IAV infection, implying that the two
viruses may competitively exclude each other18.

Whilst the analysis of post-mortem tissue is extremely informative in what may have
led to severe coronavirus infection and death, the analysis of the disease in severe
(but living cases) is naturally restricted by what tissues can be sampled (e.g. blood,
nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchial alveolar lavages). Therefore, animal models of
COVID-19 present critical tools to fill knowledge gaps for the disease in humans and
for screening therapeutic or prophylactic interventions. Compatibility with a more
extensive longitudinal tissue sampling strategy and a controlled nature of infection are
key advantages of animal models

19

. Studies in an experimental mouse model of

SARS-CoV showed that co-infection of a respiratory bacterium exacerbated
pneumonia 20. Different animal species can be infected with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 to
serve as models of COVID-19 and these include mice, hamsters, ferrets, rhesus
macaques and cynomolgus macaques. The K18-hACE2 transgenic (K18-hACE2)
mouse, where hACE2 expression is driven by the epithelial cell cytokeratin-18 (K18)
promoter, was developed to study SARS-CoV pathogenesis21. This mouse is now
being used as a model that mirrors many features of severe COVID-19 infection in
humans to develop understanding of the mechanistic basis of lung disease and to test
pharmacological interventions22,23.
With the approaching flu season in the Northern hemisphere concomitant with a
second wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections there is an obvious public health concern
about the possibility of enhanced morbidity and mortality in co-infected individuals.
The aim of this work was to use an established pre-clinical model of COVID-19 to
study the consequences of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and IAV, defining the
associated clinical, pathological and transcriptomic signatures.

Results
Sequential infection with IAV and SARS-CoV-2 leads to enhanced disease.
To assess how co-infection with influenza virus affected COVID-19, the established
K18-hACE2 mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 was utilised

SARS-CoV-2

(strain

21

. We sued a clinical isolate

hCoV-19/England/Liverpool_REMRQ0001/2020)24.

Importantly, sequence of the virus stock demonstrated that this isolate did not contain
the recently observed deletion or mutations of the furin cleavage site in the S protein
. A schematic of the experimental design is shown in Fig. 1A. Four groups of mice (n

25

= 8 per group) were used. At day 0, two groups were inoculated intranasally with 102
PFU IAV (strain A/X31) and two groups with PBS. After three days, two groups were
inoculated intranasally with 104 PFU of SARS-CoV-2. This generated four
experimental groups: Control, IAV only, SARS-CoV-2 and IAV + SARS-CoV-2 only
(Fig. 1B). Control mice maintained their body weight throughout. Mice infected with
IAV displayed a typical pattern of weight loss, reaching a nadir (mean 17% loss) at 7
dpi before starting recovery. SARS-CoV-2-infected animals started to lose weight at
day 7 (4 dpi) and carried on losing weight up to day 10 (mean 15% loss). Mice infected
with IAV then SARS-CoV-2 had a significantly-accelerated weight loss as compared
with IAV-infected mice from day 4 which was most severe at day 6 (mean 19%),
followed by a recovery to day 8 (mean 14% loss) before losing weight again (mean
17% loss) (Fig. 2A). As well as accelerated weight loss, IAV + SARS-CoV-2-infected
mice exhibited more severe respiratory symptoms and a significantly more rapid
mortality, (assessed by a humane endpoint of 20% weight loss) as compared with
mice infected with either virus alone (Fig. 2B).

Coinfection of SARS-COV-2 and IAV results in reduced SARS-COV-2 viral load
at day 6 but not day 10 post IAV
In order to determine whether the coinfection of SARS-CoV-2 and IAV was
cooperative or competitive total RNA was extracted from the lungs of the K18-hACE2
mice and viral loads were quantified using qRT-PCR. At day 6 (3 dpi), the SARS-CoV2 infected mice exhibited 10,000-fold higher levels of viral load than at day 10 (7 dpi)
(mean 6 x 1012 vs 2.8 x 108 copies of N/µg of RNA) indicating that peak viral replication
takes place before the onset of symptoms at 4 dpi (Fig, 3A). At this timepoint the mice
infected with SARS-CoV-2 alone displayed significantly higher levels of viral RNA than
the mice coinfected with IAV and SARS-COoV-2 (mean 6 x 1012 vs ~2 x 1 09 copies
of N/µg of RNA) (Fig. 3A). However, by day 10 the coinfected and singly infected mice
exhibited nearly identical levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (mean 2 x 108 vs 8.1 x 108 copies
of N/µg of RNA) (Fig. 3A). Conversely, at day 6, the mice infected with IAV alone
showed similar levels of IAV RNA compared to the coinfected mice (mean 1.3 x 107
vs 1 x 107 copies of M/µg of RNA) and by day 10 both the singly infected mice and
coinfected mice did not display any detectable IAV RNA, demonstrating similar levels
of IAV clearance (Fig. 3C). In order to investigate viral replication qPCR was employed
to quantify viral subgenomic mRNA (sgRNA) transcripts. Unlike viral genomes,
sgRNAs are not incorporated into virions, and can therefore be utilised to measure
active virus infection. The amount of sgRNA in the SARS-CoV-2 infected mice was
concomitant with the viral load, appearing to be 100-fold higher at day 6 (3dpi) than
day 10 (7dpi) (mean 6.2 x 106 vs 5.4 x 104 copies of E sgRNA/µg of RNA) (Fig. 3B).
Similarly, the amount of sgRNA was significantly lower in the coinfected mice
compared to the SARS-CoV-2 singly infected mice (mean 6.2 x 106 vs 1.7 x 104 copies
of E sgRNA/µg of RNA) however, by day 10 (7dpi) both coinfected and singly infected
mice displayed similar levels of sgRNA (mean 5.4 x 104 vs 3.5 x 105 copies of E
sgRNA/µg of RNA) (Fig. 3C).

Co-infection leads to complementary and enhanced pathological processes

a basis for the assessment of the effect of IAV and SARS-CoV-2 in these mice, a
histological examination of major organs/tissues was performed. This confirmed that
the transgenic approach had not resulted in phenotypic changes. Comparative
staining of wild type and transgenic mice for ACE2, using an antibody against human
ACE2 that also cross-reacted with mouse ACE2, also confirmed that transgenesis had

not altered the ACE2 expression pattern (respiratory epithelial cells and very rare type
II pneumocytes (Supplementary Fig. 1 A, B), endothelial cells in brain capillaries (Fig.
7 A2, A3) and liver sinusoids, renal tubular epithelial cells). The expression was not
affected by viral infection (Supplemental Fig. C-F; Fig. 7 B3, C3).
At 6 days post IAV infection, the transgenic mice exhibited the pulmonary
changes typically observed in mice after IAV X31 infection at this time point. We
observed epithelial cell degeneration and necrosis in several bronchioles which also
contained debris in the lumen (Figs. 4 B, 5B). There were occasional small focal
peribronchial areas where alveoli also exhibited necrotic cells (Fig. 4 B). IAV antigen
was found in epithelial cells in bronchi and bronchioles, in type I and II pneumocyte in
affected alveoli, and in few randomly distributed individual type II pneumocytes (data
not shown). Vessels showed evidence of lymphocyte recruitment, vasculitis and
perivascular lymphocyte infiltration. Comparative assessment of the lungs in wild type
mice at the same time point post infection confirmed that the genetic manipulation
indeed had no effect on the response of mice to IAV infection (data not shown). At the
comparative time point, SARS-CoV-2 single infection (day 6, 3 dpi) was associated
with mild changes, represented by a mild increase in interstitial cellularity, evidence of
type II pneumocyte activation (Fig. 4C, 5A), occasional desquamated alveolar
macrophages/type II pneumocytes and single erythrocytes in alveolar lumina, and a
multifocal, predominantly perivascular mononuclear infiltration with recruitment of
leukocytes into vascular walls (vasculitis) (Fig. 4 D). Viral antigen was found in
multifocal patches of individual to large groups of alveoli, randomly distributed
throughout the parenchyma (Fig. 5A2). Viral antigen was seen in type I and type II
pneumocytes and in endothelial cells in capillaries and small vessels in septa (Fig.
5A3). However, viral antigen was not detected within bronchiolar epithelial cells (Fig.
5A2). Double infection at this time point, i.e. 6 days after IAV infection and 3 days after
SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with histological changes almost identical to
those induced by IAV, although they appeared to be slightly more extensive (Fig4 E,
F). IAV antigen expression had a distribution and extent similar to that seen in single
IAV infection at the same time point. Viral antigen was found in epithelial cells in
bronchi and bronchioles, in type I and II penumocytes in affected alveoli, and in few
randomly distributed individual type II pneumocytes (Fig. 5B2). SARS-CoV-2
expression was less intense than in SARS-CoV-2-only infected mice. Viral antigen

was observed in random individual or small groups of alveoli (Fig. 5B3), in type I and
II pneumocytes and vascular endothelial cells (Fig. 5B3 inset).
Four days later, at the endpoint of the experiment, i.e. at 10 days after IAV infection
and 7 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the histopathological features had changed.
Single IAV infection had by then almost entirely resolved, however, the lungs exhibited
changes consistent with a regenerative process, i.e. mild to moderate hyperplasia of
the

bronchiolar

epithelium

with

adjacent

multifocal

respiratory

epithelial

metaplasia/type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, together with mild to moderate
lymphocyte dominated perivascular infiltration (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, the hyperplastic
epithelium was found to lack ACE2 expression (Supplemental Fig. 1 E). At this stage,
the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection was more evident. Single infection had resulted in
multifocal areas with distinct type II pneumocyte activation and syncytial cell formation
(Fig. 6B), with mild mononuclear infiltration, and mild to moderate lymphocytedominated vasculitis and perivascular infiltration. There were also a few focal areas of
mild desquamative pneumonia with intra-alveolar macrophages/type II pneumocytes,
oedema and fibrin deposition. These changes were also observed in the double
infected mice (Fig. 6C-F), where they were generally more pronounced (Fig. Lungs
6D-F) and present alongside equally pronounced regenerative changes attributable to
IAV infection (moderate hyperplasia of the bronchiolar epithelium with adjacent
multifocal respiratory epithelial metaplasia/type II pneumocyte hyperplasia; Fig. 6C).
In three of the four single SARS-CoV-infected and two of the four double infected mice
at the later time point (7 days post SARS-CoV-2 infection), we observed a mild or
moderate non-suppurative meningoencephalitis mainly affecting the midbrain and
brainstem (Fig. 7B, C). This was more severe in the double infected mice, where the
perivascular infiltrates contained degenerate leukocytes and appeared to be
associated with focal loss of integrity of the endothelial cell layer (Fig. 7C2, 3).

Distinct transcriptional signatures are associated with infection
The transcriptional profile of lung samples can provide a window on the host response
to infection for a respiratory pathogen. Therefore, lung samples were taken at Day 6
and Day 10 post IAV infection from all four groups of mice (Fig. 1B). Total RNA was
purified from cells and both host and viral mRNA (and genomic RNA in the case of
SARS-CoV-2) were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore oligo-dT cDNA synthesis
approach to identify and quantify mRNA. A multiplex of 5-10 sequencing libraries were
loaded onto a flow cell and sequenced on an Oxford Nanopore GridION for up to 72
hours.
Genes were counted against the Mus musculus annotated genome using Salmon

26

.

Gene counts were normalised using the edgeR package before identifying
differentially expressed genes using the transcription profile from mock infected mice
as the control profile. A total of 970 differentially expressed gene transcripts were
observed in comparison to mock infected animals out of a total of 3495 gene
transcripts identified. Principle component analysis (PCA) revealed overlapping
transcriptional profiles between infection groups (Fig. 8A). Overlapping signatures
were likely to be indicative of the non-specific anti-viral response. Contrast matrices
were made between mice that were coinfected versus mice that were mock infected
and mice that were singly infected (Table 1). The transcriptomic profile in mice 10 days
post infection with IAV showed overlap with the healthy controls, consistent with
resolution of infection and regeneration seen in the pathology (Supplementary Fig 2).
The data indicated that coinfection at day 10 versus IAV day 10 had more differences
with 36 gene transcripts at higher abundance, highlighted in the top 75 differentially
expressed genes (Fig. 8B).

Figure 8: RNA sequencing analysis from hACE2 mice lung homogenates from mice infected
with either IAV only, SARS-CoV-2 only or IAV and SARS-CoV-2 (n=4-5). A. Principle component
analysis performed for 29 samples with log2 transformed counts per million (cpm). B. The top 75
differentially expressed gene transcripts across 4 groups are shown. C. Volcano plots comparing
differentially expressed genes from each infection group vs mock infected. The horizontal dashed line
is representative of a q-value <0.05, and the vertical dashed line is representative of a log2 fold-change
of 2. Significant differentially expressed gene transcripts are marked as red.

Gene ontology analysis of gene transcripts that were significantly different in
abundance at all time points revealed enrichment of gene clusters involved in the
innate immune response, immune system regulation and cellular response to cytokine
stimulus, interferon beta and interferon gamma (supplementary Fig. 4). The
differentially expressed gene transcripts between coinfection day 10 versus IAV day
10 were associated with interferon responses according to biological process terms
(supplementary Fig. 5).
Interferon and cytokine responses are upregulated in response to infection, and
maintained in coinfection
Following gene ontology analysis, gene transcripts were grouped by biological
process terms and presented as heatmaps to allow for direct comparison of their
abundance across the experimental groups. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in the
increased abundance of gene transcripts involved in the interferon and cytokine
signalling pathways. When mice were infected with both SARS-CoV-2 and IAV, certain
gene transcripts within these pathways remained increased in abundance at later time
points, in comparison to individual IAV infection at day 10 (Fig. 9). These included Ifit1,
Ifit3, Ifit3b, Isg15, Irf7 and Cxcl10. This suggested a sustained innate/interferon
response in these animals.

Discussion
In this study, sequential infection with IAV followed by SARS-CoV-2 and led to more
severe pulmonary disease than infections with IAV or SARS-CoV-2 alone. Following
IAV infection, mice coinfected with SARS-CoV-2 displayed significantly higher weight
loss, elevated respiratory distress and more rapid mortality compared to mice infected
with IAV alone. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that the expression of several
genes specific to airway epithelial cells such as Scgb3a1, Cfap126, and Cyp2f2 was
more downregulated in coinfected mice compared to singly infected mice at days 6
and 10, which is likely indicative of increased lung epithelial cell damage. Interestingly,
coinfected mice exhibited significantly lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA and
sgRNA at day 6 (3 dpi with SARS-CoV-2) compared to SARS-CoV-2 singly infected
mice, indicating that, whilst coinfection results in enhanced respiratory symptoms,
existing IAV infection interferes with infection of SARS-CoV-2 at this time point. These
findings were recapitulated by analysis and comparison of lung pathology which
showed that coinfected animals displayed similar yet more pronounced IAV pathology
compared to IAV singly infected animals but displayed reduced SARS-CoV-2 antigen
staining compared to SARS-CoV-2 singly infected mice. By day 10, coinfected mice

and SARS-CoV-2 singly infected mice displayed similar levels of viral RNA and
sgRNA, suggesting that whilst initially inhibited by the presence of IAV, SARS-CoV-2
was able to overcome this inhibition and achieve unconstrained viral replication. This
was reflected in the lung transcriptome profile that showed a sustained innate
response in coinfected animals over the time-period of both infections. Viral
Interference is a well-documented phenomenon which has previously been reported
between influenza B viruses (IBV) in a ferret model, in which infection with one IBV
subtype was able to prevent infection with another subtype when infections were
separated by 3 days 27. Similar to the observations described herein between IAV and
SARS-CoV-2, coinfection of antigenically unrelated viruses such as IAV and IBV did
not confer resistance when challenged within 3 days, but merely delayed the shedding
of the challenged virus. This delay in shedding likely accounts for the differing times
at which coinfected animals and SARS-CoV-2 singly infected animals lose weight;
SARS-CoV-2 singly infected animals exhibit weight loss at 4dpi however, coinfected
animals begin to recover from IAV infection before succumbing to delayed SARS-CoV2 infection. Unlike this study, wherein IAV and SARS-CoV-2 coinfected animals
exhibited significantly increased weight loss, coinfection with IAV and IBV has been
reported to delayed viral shedding but did not influence disease severity.
Mathematical modelling and in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that prior infection
with rhinovirus interferes with IAV infection 5. This interference is mediated by the
induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) following rhinovirus infection which
work to suppress IAV. Similarly, infection with IAV results in the activation of the IFN
response and the upregulation of ISGs which induce an antiviral state which works to
limit infection 28 and reviewed 29. We propose that it is this response which is active in
the K-18hACE2 mice 3 days post IAV infection and is responsible for the inhibition of
the incoming SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus resulting in lower viral load as measured by
RT-qPCR at day 6. IAV viral load was found to be similar between coinfected and IAV
singly infected mice, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 infection does not interfere with
prior IAV infection. Similarly, by day 10 (7 dpi SARS-CoV-2) both coinfected and IAV
singly infected mice were negative for IAV by qPCR, indicating that SARS-CoV-2
infection does not prolong IAV infection or interfere with the ability of the immune
system to clear IAV infection. At this stage, the IAV singly infected mice exhibited lung
pathology associated with regeneration including hyperplasia of the bronchiolar

epithelium and respiratory pneumocytes. This regenerative pathology was supported
by the transcriptomic profiles of the IAV singly infected mice at day 10 which showed
overlap with the healthy controls. These transcriptomic profiles were characterised by
the decreased expression of several ISGs including Isg15, Ligp1, Gbp6, Ifi206, Ifitm3
and Ifit3, compared to day 6. Conversely, while the coinfected mice also displayed
evidence of epithelial regeneration, they also presented several hallmarks of acute
lung injury including perivascular infiltration, vasculitis and oedema. This elevated lung
injury is consistent with the viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 present in these animals at day
10 and the lung transcriptomic profile which revealed that the coinfected mice
maintained heightened levels of ISG transcription in addition to several other genes
associated with cytokine and IFN-γ signalling compared to the IAV singly infected
mice.
As has recently been reported in studies using K18-hACE2 transgenic mice

23,30

,

pathology revealed brain involvement in some of the SARS-CoV-2 singly infected and
coinfected mice at day 10 which manifested as non-suppurative meningoencephalitis
predominantly affecting the midbrain and brainstem. Previous studies using K18hACE2 mice focusing on SARS-CoV have shown that the virus spreads throughout
the brain around 3 days post intranasal inoculation 21,23,31 however the mechanism of
entry is unclear as one study reported abundant infection of the olfactory bulb 31 while
the other showed little involvement

21

. Unlike SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV has been

shown to enter the brain earlier at 3dpi but does not elicit notable inflammation in this
secondary site of infection 31. Interestingly, the coinfected mice displayed more severe
brain pathology, with perivascular infiltration and epithelial breakdown. The
mechanism through which co-infection with IAV may enhance SARS-CoV-2
neurological infection is unclear. While brain infection has been well documented in
cases of influenza

32-34

, this is predominantly limited to neurotropic and highly

pathogenic strains and occurs via breakdown of the blood brain barrier (BBB) following
high levels of viremia 33,35. BBB integrity is also reduced by proinflammatory cytokines
such as IL-6, IL-1β and IFN- γ which disrupt the tight-junctions maintained by brain
microvascular endothelial cells (reviewed in 36). While the IAV X31 strain used herein
did not result in brain pathology in singly infected animals, it is possible that the
increased cytokine response present in coinfected animals further compromised BBB
integrity and therefore induced enhanced brain pathology.

No animal model can predict with absolute certainty the consequences of coinfection
in humans. However, the data presented here may have critical implications for
development of successful pre-emptive interventions for SARS-CoV-2. Fortunately,
public health interventions aimed at delaying the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should
also provide a consequent reduction in transmission of influenza if they are effectively
implemented. Moreover, some but not all experimental therapeutics being studied for
SARS-CoV-2 have also been demonstrated to exhibit activity against influenza. As for
other viruses for which successful antiviral interventions have been developed, the
SARS-CoV-2 polymerase has emerged as a strong initial target for small molecule
inhibitors. Importantly, drugs such as remdesivir and favipiravir that are in various
stages of development and clinical evaluation for SARS-CoV-2 have a direct or
metabolite-driven in vitro activity against influenza

37,38

, with favipiravir also approved

for influenza in Japan. Other examples of dual activity against these viruses are
evident with other small molecule antivirals such as nitazoxanide 39-41 and niclosamide
42,43

, which may present opportunities and/or a basis for prioritisation of candidates for

clinical evaluation if necessary exposures can be achieved

44,45

. Such antiviral

interventions have potential application in treatment of early infection as well as the
prophylactic setting. Chemoprevention is a particularly attractive approach as we
move into winter months, and selection of the right candidates for evaluation may
provide a benefit for both viruses individually and in coinfection. It should be noted that
many of the advanced technologies (e.g. broadly neutralising monoclonal antibodies)
that are being rapidly accelerated through development have explicit specificities that
provide high potency, but this is likely to preclude activity against viruses other than
those against which they are directed. The work presented here shows that our
approach will be an effective pre-clinical platform with which to text therapeutic
approaches to dealing with co-infection which is pertinent with the approaching flu
season in the Northern hemisphere concomitant with a second wave of SARS-CoV-2
infections.

Methods
Cell culture and virus
Influenza virus A/HKx31 (X31, H3N2) was propagated in the allantoic cavity of 9-dayold embryonated chicken eggs at 35oC for 72 h. Titres were determined by an
influenza plaque assay using MDCK cells.
Vero E6 cells (C1008; African green monkey kidney cells) were obtained from
Public Health England and maintained in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium
(DMEM) containing 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.05 mg/mL gentamycin at
37°C with 5% CO2.
UK strain of SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-2/human/Liverpool/REMRQ0001/2020),
which was cultured from a nasopharyngeal swab from a patient, was passaged a
further 4 times in Vero E6 cells

24

. The fourth passage of virus was cultured MOI of

0.001 in Vero E6 cells with DMEM containing 4% FBS and 0.05 mg/mL gentamycin at
37°C with 5% CO2 and was harvested 48 h post inoculation. Virus stocks were stored
at −80°C. The intracellular viral genome sequence and the titre of virus in the
supernatant were determined. Direct RNA sequencing was performed as describe
previously

25

and an inhouse script was used to check for deletions in the mapped

reads. The Illumina reads were mapped to the England/2/2020 genome using HISAT
and the consensus genome was called using an in-house script based on the
dominant nucleotide at each location on the genome. The sequence has been
submitted to Genbank, accession number MW041156.
Ethics and clinical information
The patient from which the virus sample was obtained gave informed consent and was
recruited under the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection
Consortium (ISARIC) Clinical Characterisation Protocol CCP (https://isaric.net/ccp),

performed at containment level 3 by personnel equipped with respirator airstream
units with filtered air supply.
Mice
Animal work was approved by the local University of Liverpool Animal Welfare and
Ethical Review Body and performed under UK Home Office Project Licence
PP4715265. Mice carrying the human ACE2 gene under the control of the keratin 18
promoter (K18-hACE2; formally B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J) were used in this
study were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Mice were maintained under SPF
barrier conditions in individually ventilated cages.
Virus infection
Animals were randomly assigned into multiple cohorts. For IAV infection, mice were
anaesthetized lightly with KETASET i.m. and inoculated intra-nasally with 102 PFU
IAV X31 in 50 µl sterile PBS. For SARS-CoV-2 infection, mice were anaesthetized
lightly with isoflurane and inoculated intra-nasally with 50 µl containing 104 PFU SARSCoV-2 in PBS. They were sacrificed at variable time-points after infection by an
overdose of pentabarbitone. Tissues were removed immediately for downstream
processing.
Histology, immunohistology
Tissues were fixed in formal saline for 24 h and routinely paraffin wax embedded.
Consecutive sections (3-5 µm) were either stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE)
or used for immunohistology (IH). IH was performed to detect viral antigens and to
identify ACE2, using the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and the avidin biotin complex
(ABC) method. The following primary antibodies were applied: rabbit anti-human
ACE2 (Novus Biologicals; clone SN0754; NBP2-67692), goat anti-IAV (Meridian Life
Sciences Inc., B65141G), following previously published protocols

46-48

. and rabbit

anti-SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (Rockland, 200-402-A50). Briefly, after
deparaffination, sections underwent antigen retrieval in citrate buffer (pH 6.0; Agilent)
for ACE2 and SARS-CoV NP detection, and Tris/EDTA buffer (pH 9) for IAV for 20
min at 98 °C, followed by incubation with the primary antibodies (diluted in dilution
buffer, Agilent; anti-IAV 1:200, anti-ACE2, 1:200 and anti-SARS-CoV 1:3000) and
overnight at 4⁰C for ACE2 and SARS-CoV and for 1 h at room temperature (RT) for

IAV. This was followed by blocking of endogenous peroxidase (peroxidase block,
Agilent) for 10 min at RT and incubation with the secondary antibodies,
EnVision+/HRP, Rabbit (Agilent) for ACE2 and SARS-CoV, and rabbit anti-goat
Ig/HRP (Agilent) for IAV), for 30 min at RT, and EnVision FLEX DAB+ Chromogen in
Substrate buffer (Agilent) for 10 min at RT, all in an autostainer (Dako). Sections were
subsequently counterstained with haematoxylin.

RNA extraction and DNase treatment
The upper lobes of the right lung were dissected and homogenised in 1ml of TRIzol
reagent (Thermofisher) using a Bead Ruptor 24 (Omni International) at 2 meters per
second for 30 sec. The homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000xg for
5 min before full RNA extraction was carried out according to manufacturer’s
instructions. RNA was quantified and quality assessed using a Nanodrop
(Thermofisher) before a total of 1ug was DNase treated using the TURBO DNA-free™
Kit (Thermofisher) as per manufacturer’s instructions.
qRT-PCR for viral load
Viral loads were quantified using the GoTaq® Probe 1-Step RT-qPCR System
(Promega). For quantification of SARS-COV-2 the nCOV_N1 primer/probe mix from
the SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) CDC qPCR Probe Assay (IDT) were utilised while the
standard curve was generated via 10-fold serial dilution of the 2019-nCoV_N_Positive
Control (IDT) from 106 to 0.1 copies/reaction. The E sgRNA primers and probe have
been previously described (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2196-x) and
were utilised at 400nM and 200nM respectively. Murine 18S primers and probe
sequences ere utilsied at 400nM and 200nM respectively. The IAV primers and probe
sequences are published as part of the CDC IAV detection kit (20403211). The IAV
reverse genetics plasmid encoding the NS segment was diluted 10-fold from 106 to
0.1 copies/reaction to serve as a standard curve. The thermal cycling conditions for all
qRT-PCR reactions were as follows: 1 cycle of 45°C for 15 min and 1 cycle of 95°C
followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec and 60°C for 1 minute. The 18s standard was
generated by the amplification of a fragment of the murine 18S cDNA using the primers
F: ACCTGGTTGATCCTGCCAGGTAGC and R: GCATGCCAGAGTCTCGTTCG.

Similarly, the E sgRNA standard was generated by PCR using the qPCR primers.
cDNA was generated using the SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase kit (Thermofisher)
and PCR carried out using Q5® High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs)
as per manufacturer’s instructions. Both PCR products were purified using the
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and serially diluted 10-fold from 1010 to 104
copies/reaction to form the standard curve.

cDNA sequencing with Oxford Nanopore
cDNA libraries were made starting with 50ng of total RNA which was accurately
quantified using a Qubit 3.0 fluorometer (Thermofisher) and the Qubit RNA HS Assay
Kit (Thermofisher). The cDNA was generated using the PCR-cDNA Barcoding (SQKPCB109) sequencing kit by Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Multiplexed libraries were
loaded onto a R9.4.1 flowcell and ran for up to 72 hours on a GridION. The raw
sequence reads have been submitted to NCBI SRA under bioproject: PRJNA666048.
RNA sequencing bioinformatic analysis
Multiplexed sequencing reads were basecalled and demultiplexed by guppy.
Minimap2 was used to index and map reads to the reference genome
(Mus_musculus.GRCm38.cdna.all.fa) to generate alignment files using the –ax mapont -N 100 -p 1.0 parameters 49. Alignment files were sorted and indexed with samtools
before counting reads using Salmon with the corresponding annotation file
(Mus_musculus.GRCm38.gtf) from Ensembl using –noErrorModel -l U parameters
26,50

. The edgeR package was used to normalise sequencing libraries and identify

differentially expressed genes, defined as at least a 2-fold difference from the mock
infected group (n=5) and a false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05

51

. Principle

component Analysis (PCA), volcano plots, heatmaps and Venn diagrams were
produced in R studio using the following packages: edgeR, ggplot2 and pheatmap.
Differential gene expression data was used for gene ontology enrichment analysis of
biological process terms in each group using enrichGO in the ClusterProfiler
programme in R

52

. A q-value cut-off of 0.05 was used with a Benjamini-Hochberg-

FDR correction. GOSemSim was used to simplify and remove redundant GO terms 53
and the top 20 biological processes are presented for each condition.

Statistical analysis. Data were analysed using the Prism package (version 5.04
Graphpad Software). P values were set at 95% confidence interval. A repeatedmeasures two-way ANOVA (Bonferroni post-test) was used for time-courses of weight
loss; two-way ANOVA (Bonferroni post-test) was used for other time-courses; log-rank
(Mantel-Cox) test was used for survival curves. All differences not specifically stated
to be significant were not significant (p > 0.05). For all figures, *p < 0.05, **p <0.01,
***p < 0.001.
