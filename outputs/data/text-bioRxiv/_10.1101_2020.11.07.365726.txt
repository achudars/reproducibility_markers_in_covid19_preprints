Summary
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is continuing to disrupt personal lives, global healthcare systems
and economies. Hence, there is an urgent need for a vaccine that prevents viral infection,
transmission and disease. Here, we present a two-component protein-based nanoparticle
vaccine that displays multiple copies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Immunization studies
show that this vaccine induces potent neutralizing antibody responses in mice, rabbits and
cynomolgus macaques. The vaccine-induced immunity protected macaques against a high
dose challenge, resulting in strongly reduced viral infection and replication in upper and lower
airways. These nanoparticles are a promising vaccine candidate to curtail the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread across
the globe and infected more than 46 million individuals since late 2019
(https://covid19.who.int/). SARS-CoV-2 causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which
manifests itself as a mild respiratory illness in most infected individuals, but can lead to acute
respiratory distress syndrome and death in a significant percentage of cases. As of 1 October
2020, COVID-19 has caused over 1 million casualties and continues to place a significant
burden on healthcare systems and economies worldwide. Hence, the development of a safe
and effective vaccine that can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission has rapidly
become top priority.
Recent studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers are an
important immune correlate of protection (Addetia et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020). This is
supported by several passive immunization studies showing that administration of potent
neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can significantly reduce lung
viral loads (Cao et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020). Thus, a successful vaccine will likely need
to induce a potent NAb response. The main target for NAbs on SARS-CoV-2 is the spike (S)
protein. This homotrimeric glycoprotein is anchored in the viral membrane and consists of the
S1 domain, containing the receptor-binding domain (RBD) for the host cell receptor
angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), and the S2 domain, which contains the fusion
peptide. Upon binding to ACE2, the prefusion S protein undergoes several structural changes
that induce a shift to a postfusion state that enables merging of the viral envelope and host
cell membrane (Shang et al., 2020). As most NAb epitopes are presented on the prefusion
conformation, vaccine candidates should include the prefusion S protein, which as for other
class I viral fusion proteins (Krarup et al., 2015; Sanders et al., 2002), can be stabilized by
appropriately positioned proline substitutions (Pallesen et al., 2017; Walls et al., 2020a; Wrapp
et al., 2020).
More than 200 candidate vaccines are currently under preclinical or clinical evaluation
(https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines).
Recombinant subunit vaccines provide a welcome alternative to the inactivated, viral vector
and RNA-based vaccines that are currently in Phase III clinical trials, as they have a track
record of safety and efficacy. In addition, recombinantly expressed S proteins represent the
most efficient antigens to induce potent NAb responses, as recently reported in non-human
primate studies (Guebre-Xabier et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020; Tian et al. 2020).
A well established strategy to generate strong humoral immune responses against soluble
antigens is multivalent antigen display (Bachmann and Jennings, 2010; Moyer et al., 2016).
Presenting a high density of antigen on a repetitive array facilitates numerous immunological
processes such as B cell activation, lymph node trafficking and retention on follicular dendritic
cells (Kelly et al., 2019; Tokatlian et al., 2019). Among the several nanoparticle designs that
are currently being employed to present viral glycoproteins, self-assembling protein
nanoparticle systems represent promising platforms as they allow for efficient and scalable
nanoparticle assembly (López-Sagaseta et al., 2016). Homomeric protein complexes such as
the 24-subunit ferritin and 60-subunit mi3 nanoparticles self assemble intracellularly and have
been used to display immunogens such as influenza HA, HIV-1 Env, malaria CyRPA and more
recently SARS-CoV-2 S (Bruun et al., 2018; He et al., 2020; Kanekiyo et al., 2013; Powell et
al., 2020; Sliepen et al., 2015). Recently, two-component 120 subunit icosahedral
nanoparticles, such as the I53-50 and dn5 designs, have been developed that self-assemble
in vitro, allowing for controlled nanoparticle formation. We and others have been using these
nanoparticles to multivalently present trimeric type 1 viral fusion proteins of HIV-1, respiratory
syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza (Boyoglu-Barnum et al., 2020; Brouwer et al., 2019;
Marcandalli et al., 2019). Presentation of these immunogens on two-component protein

nanoparticles significantly improved NAb titers, which supports pursuing this platform for the
generation of nanoparticle immunogens displaying prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S proteins.
Here, we describe the generation and characterization of two-component protein
nanoparticles displaying stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S proteins. Immunization studies
in mice, rabbits and macaques demonstrated that these nanoparticles induce robust humoral
responses. Vaccinated macaques challenged with a high dose of SARS-CoV-2 virus had
strongly reduced viral loads in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and were preserved
from lung lesions when compared to unvaccinated animals.

Results
SARS-CoV-2 S proteins can be displayed on two component I53-50 nanoparticles
The computationally designed I53-50 nanoparticle (I53-50NP) constitutes twenty trimeric (I5350A or variants thereof) and twelve pentameric (I53-50B.4PT1) subunits which self-assemble
to form monodisperse icosahedral particles with a diameter of approximately 30 nm (Bale et
al., 2016). To generate I53-50NPs presenting SARS-CoV-2 S proteins, we genetically fused
the C-terminus of the previously described stabilized prefusion S protein to the N-terminus of
the I53-50A variant, I53-50A.1NT1, using a glycine-serine linker (Figure 1A) (Brouwer et al.,
2020). The fusion protein was purified from transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293F
cell supernatant using Ni-NTA purification followed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC).
Collection of the appropriate SEC fractions yielded ~2 mg/L of trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S-I5350A.1NT1 fusion protein (Figure 1B). To initiate assembly of nanoparticles presenting SARSCoV-2 S proteins (SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs), the pooled trimer fractions were incubated
overnight at 4°C with I53-50B.4PT1 in an equimolar ratio. The nanoparticle preparation was
further purified using an additional SEC step to remove unassembled components. Negativestain electron microscopy (nsEM) of the pooled higher molecular weight fractions revealed a
considerable portion of monodisperse and well-ordered icosahedral nanoparticles (Figure 1C).
Bio-layer-interferometry (BLI)-based binding experiments with a panel of SARS-CoV-2 S
protein-specific monoclonal NAbs, previously isolated from recovered COVID-19 patients
(Brouwer et al., 2020), showed strong binding of RBD-specific COVA1-18, COVA2-02,
COVA2-15 and COVA2-39, and N-terminal domain (NTD)-specific COVA1-22, to trimeric
SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50A.1NT1 and SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NP (Figure 1D). This suggests that
presentation of SARS-CoV-2 S on I53-50NPs did not compromise the structure of these S
protein epitopes. Altogether, SEC, nsEM and BLI confirmed the successful generation of
nanoparticles presenting multiple copies of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein.
As approximately a third of the mass of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein consists of N-linked
glycans, we sought to identify the site-specific glycosylation of S protein presented on I5350NPs using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). All sites presented high
levels of occupancy, with only N1074 displaying 15% of sites lacking an N-linked glycan
(Figure S1A). The compositions of glycans present at the 19 N-linked glycan sites on the S
protein were determined and revealed a diverse range of structures (Figure S1B). Underprocessed oligomannose-type glycans were observed at sites N61, N234, N717, N801 and to
a lesser extent at N1098. The average oligomannose-type glycan content across all sites was
11%. Processed complex-type glycans were observed at all sites and were highly fucosylated
(73%), but mostly lacked sialylation (8%) (Figures S1A and S1B). The glycoforms present on
SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs are more processed compared to other recombinant S protein
immunogens (Watanabe et al., 2020), but are reminiscent of the composition on S proteins
presented on virions (Yao et al., 2020).

SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs enhance activation of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific B cells
in vitro
Multivalent display of antigens can enhance cognate B cell activation over soluble antigen
(Boyoglu-Barnum et al., 2020; Kanekiyo et al., 2013; Marcandalli et al., 2019; Veneziano et
al., 2020). To assess if the same would apply for SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs, we generated B
cells that expressed B cell receptors (BCRs) for previously described RBD-targeting
monoclonal NAbs and measured their activation by monitoring Ca influx in vitro (Brouwer et
al., 2020). Soluble trimers only weakly activated COVA1-18 expressing B cells at the highest
concentration used (5 μg/mL SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50A.1NT1), while an equimolar amount of
SARS-CoV-2 S presented on I53-50NPs efficiently activated the same B cells (Figure 2).
COVA2-15-expressing B cells were activated by soluble SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50A.1NT1
trimers, but markedly more efficiently so by SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NP. The more efficient
activation of COVA2-15-expressing B cells, than those expressing COVA1-18, may be
explained by the fact that COVA2-15 can interact with the RBD in both the up and down state,
which may result in higher avidity interactions (Brouwer et al., 2020). In control experiments,
I53-50NPs displaying soluble HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (BG505 SOSIP) did not activate
any of the B cell lines. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs considerably improve the
activation of SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells compared to soluble trimers.

SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NP vaccination induces robust NAb responses in small animal
models
We assessed the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs in two small animal models.
Eight BALB/c mice were immunized with 10 µg of SARS-CoV-2 S presented on I53-50NPs,
adjuvanted in polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly-IC). In addition, five New Zealand White
rabbits were immunized with 30 µg of SARS-CoV-2 S presented on I53-50NPs, adjuvanted in
squalene emulsion. Mice and rabbits received three subcutaneous and intramuscular
immunizations, respectively, at week 0, 4 and 12 (Figure 3A).
Two weeks after the first immunization, mice and rabbits induced detectable SARS-CoV-2 S
protein-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers, as determined by an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), with a median endpoint binding titer of 2,920 and 5,105
respectively. In mice, median endpoint titers were further boosted after the second
immunization to 57,943 at week 6 and slightly decreased after the third, to 47,643 at week 14
(Figure 3B). In rabbits, median endpoint titers were boosted to 544,503 at week 6 and 594,292
at week 14 (Figure 3C). Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was already detectable in
the majority of mice and rabbit sera two weeks after the first immunization. NAb titers, which
are represented by the inhibitory dilutions at which 50% neutralization is attained (ID50 values),
increased to a median of 16,792 at week 6 and 49,039 at week 14 in mice (Figure 3D and
table S1). In rabbits, NAb titers were boosted to a median ID50 of 68,298 and 135,128 at week
6 and 14, respectively (Figure 3E and Table S1). Neutralization titers of authentic SARS-CoV2 virus at week 14 reached a median ID50 of 4,065 and 15,110 in mice and rabbits, respectively
(Figures 3D and 3E, and Table S1). Collectively, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs
were able to induce robust binding and NAb responses in both mice and rabbits after two and
three immunizations.
SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NP vaccination induces potent humoral responses in cynomolgus
macaques
The high binding and neutralization titers in mice and rabbits supported subsequent
assessment of the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs in cynomolgus macaques;
an animal model that is immunologically closer to humans. Six cynomolgus macaques were

immunized with 50 µg of SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs formulated in monophospholipid A
(MPLA) liposomes by the intramuscular route at week 0, 4 and 10 (Figure 4A).
To analyze the frequency of S protein and RBD-specific IgG-positive B cells in macaques after
vaccination, peripheral blood mononuclear cells at week 12 were gated on the expression of
CD20 and IgG and stained with fluorescently labeled prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S protein or RBD
(Figure 4B). We observed a clear expansion of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific B cells by
vaccination, which constituted on average about 1% of total B cells (Figure 4C). Within the
population of IgG-positive SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific B cells, on average around 30%
bound to the RBD (Figure 4C). SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific T cells were also markedly
expanded, as determined by an enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot assay (ELISpot)
(Figure 4D). Furthermore, we observed pronounced expansion of S protein-specific T follicular
helper (Tfh) cells (CD69+ CD154+ CXCR5+) within the CD4+ T cell subset, as determined by
the activation induced marker (AIM) assay (Figure 4E and Figure S2).
Sera of the immunized macaques exhibited SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific binding IgG
responses with median endpoint titers of 211, 1,601 and 2,190, at week 2, 6, and 12,
respectively (Figure 5A). To compare binding titers to SARS-CoV-2 S protein and RBD
between sera from vaccinated macaques and those from convalescent humans from the
COSCA cohort (28), a different ELISA protocol was used. Specifically, binding responses were
compared to a standard curve of species-specific polyclonal IgG so that a semi-quantitative
measure of specific IgG concentrations could be obtained. Week 6 and 12 sera elicited
markedly higher IgG binding titers to SARS-CoV-2 S protein than serum from convalescent
humans (Figure 5B). This was also the case for RBD-specific binding titers (Figure 5C).
Using a custom Luminex bead-based serological assay, we analyzed the induction of several
Ig isotypes in serum, nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples of the vaccinated macaques
over time. S-specific IgG levels in serum showed a similar course as observed by ELISA
(Figure 5D and Figure S3A). This was also the case for IgA, albeit with a more rapid onset
and waning after vaccination. As expected, IgM levels peaked after the first immunization and
gradually waned thereafter; presumably a result of Ig class-switching (Figure 5D and Figure
S3A). We also observed an increase in S-specific IgG and IgA levels in nasopharyngeal swabs
and saliva after consecutive immunizations. This was particularly clear for IgG in
nasopharyngeal swabs (Figure 5D and Figure S3B). The results in saliva samples were more
variable (Figure 5D and Figure S3C). Thus, in addition to a systemic antibody response,
SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs induced detectable mucosal IgA and IgG responses; a relevant
finding considering that the respiratory mucosa is the first port of entry for SARS-CoV-2
(Sungnak et al., 2020). Finally, we analyzed the ability of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific
serum Abs to bind to immune proteins that play a role in Fc-mediated effector functions. The
levels of FcγRIIa, FcγRIIIa and C1q binding tracked with IgG levels, suggesting that the
induced IgGs can perform effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular-cytotoxicity,
phagocytosis and complement activation (Figure S3D).
Serum neutralization titers in the vaccinated macaques were overall robust. Already two
weeks after the first immunization, macaques induced pseudovirus neutralization with a
median ID of 475. The second immunization increased the neutralization titers to a median
ID of 8,865 which then declined only modestly up to the third immunization. NAb titers were
further increased to a median ID of 26,361 at week 12 (Figure 5E and Table S3). At week 6
the neutralization titers were similar to those in sera from convalescent humans, but
neutralization titers at week 12 were significantly higher in vaccinated macaques than
convalescent humans (median ID of 26,361 vs 8,226, p = 0.0012) (Figure 5F). Neutralization
of authentic SARS-CoV-2 was lower than that of pseudovirus but remained potent (median
ID of 1,501 and 3,942 at week 6 and 12, respectively) (Figure 5G and Table S3).

SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NP vaccination protects cynomolgus macaques from high-dose
SARS-CoV-2 challenge
To assess the protective potential of SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs, vaccinated macaques and
contemporaneous control macaques (n=4) were infected with a total dose of 1 x 106 plaqueforming units (PFU) of a primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate (BetaCoV/France/IDF/0372/2020;
passaged twice in VeroE6 cells) by combined intra-nasal and intra-tracheal routes at week 12,
two weeks after the final immunization. This represents a high dose challenge in comparison
with other studies where 10- to 100-fold lower doses were used (van Doremalen et al., 2020;
Feng et al., 2020; Guebre-Xabier et al., 2020; Mercado et al., 2020; Patel et al., 2020; Yu et
al., 2020). Control animals had high viral load levels in nasopharyngeal and tracheal samples
(swabs), as assessed by RT-qPCR for viral RNA, as early as 1 day post exposure (dpe). In
tracheal samples, viral loads peaked between 1 and 3 dpe, with a median value of 6.9 log10
copies/mL. Subsequently, viral loads progressively decreased and all animals had
undetectable viral loads by 14 dpe (Figure 6A and Figure S4). Similar profiles were observed
in nasal swabs, although viral loads remained detectable in some macaques at 14 dpe (Figure
6A and Figure S4). Viral loads were markedly lower in rectal samples but stayed above the
limit of detection during the course of sampling for 2/4 control macaques (Figure S4A). Viral
subgenomic (sg)RNA, which is believed to reflect viral replication, peaked at 2 dpe in tracheal
and nasopharyngeal swabs (median viral sgRNA load 5.8 and 7.1 log10 respectively) and were
still detectable (> 3.5 log10 copies/mL of viral sgRNA) at 5 and 6 dpe in the nasopharynx for 3
and 2 animals respectively (Figure 6B).
In vaccinated macaques, median peak viral loads were 300-fold lower in tracheal samples
(6.8 log10 vs 4.3 log10; p = 0.0095) and 500-fold lower in nasopharyngeal samples compared
to unvaccinated controls (7.9 log10 vs 5.2 log10; p = 0.0095). With the exception of MF7, all
vaccinated animals had undetectable loads at 6 dpe in tracheal and nasopharyngeal swabs
(Figure 6A and Figure S4). In addition to the upper airways, SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NP
vaccination significantly decreased viral loads in the lower airways, as demonstrated by a 275fold lower median viral load in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) ( 6.5 log10 vs 4.1 log10; p =
0.0095). Viral replication was also significantly reduced in vaccinated animals. Only 2 out of 6
vaccinated animals (MF5 and MF6) showed detectable sgRNA in the trachea at 2 dpe and
median viral loads were 160-fold lower than in control animals (5.7 log10 vs 3.5 log10; p =
0.0095). In the nasopharynx, sgRNA remained below the limit of detection at any of the
timepoints. At 2 dpe, median sgRNA loads in the vaccinated animals were 5400-fold lower
than in controls (7.2 log10 vs 3.5 log10; p = 0.0048) (Figure 6B). In BAL samples we observed
a 120-fold reduction of median sgRNA at day 3 dpe (5.6 log10 vs 3.5 log10; p = 0.0048) (Figures
6A and 6B).
An anamnestic response after challenge (i.e. an increase in (N)Ab titers following challenge
after vaccination) implies that vaccination is unable to induce sterilizing immunity. We
observed no increase in NAb titers in vaccinated macaques at 2, 3 and 6 weeks after
challenge, in contrast to the control animals (Figure S5). Instead, NAbs titers continued to
wane, suggesting that vaccine-induced immunity rapidly controlled infection following
challenge, preventing a boost of the immune system.
To assess the potential emergence of viral escape mutants in macaques after challenge, viral
variants in the challenge inoculum, nasal swabs at 3 and 5 dpe, and in BAL at 3 dpe were
sequenced. Two main viral variants were identified in the inoculum (V367F in the S protein
and G251V in ORF3a), which were later also found in the nasopharyngeal swabs and BAL
samples. A median of 6 subclonal mutations were found per sample over all corresponding
time points and anatomical sites, but no major differences were observed between control and
vaccinated animals (Figure 6C). The majority of the variants observed in ORF1ab were mostly
missense mutations, and consisted of a C>T nucleotide change (Figure S6 and Table S2). A

distinct variant in the S sequence arose in 2 vaccinated macaques at day 3 in the
nasopharyngeal swab but disappeared at day 5 post challenge, suggesting that no NAb
escape mutations emerged in vaccinated animals (Figure 6C).
Vaccinated cynomolgus macaques have reduced clinical manifestations
Similar to previous observations (Maisonnasse et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020), during the first
14 dpe all contemporaneous and historical control animals showed mild pulmonary lesions
characterized by non-extended ground-glass opacities (GGOs) detected by chest computed
tomography (CT) (Figure 6D). By contrast, only 3 out of 6 vaccinated animals showed low CT
scores characteristics of mild and non-extended GGOs. Of note, the vaccinated macaque
(MF6) with the highest CT score at day 14 showed the lowest S protein- and RBD-specific
binding titers, the lowest NAb titers, and the highest viral load and sgRNA at day 5 pe.
Whereas all control animals experienced lymphopenia at 2 dpe, corresponding probably to
the installation of the response to infection, lymphocyte counts remained stable after challenge
for the vaccinated macaques (Figure 6E and Figure S5), in agreement with the absence of
detectable anamnestic response. Together, these data further support that vaccination with
SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs reduces the severity of infection.

Discussion
The development and distribution of a protective vaccine is paramount to bring the SARSCoV-2 pandemic to a halt. Over the last months, numerous vaccine candidates of different
modalities have entered clinical and preclinical studies, including inactivated virus, DNA,
mRNA, vector and protein-based vaccines (Klasse et al., 2020). Multivalent presentation of
RSV and influenza antigens on two-component self-assembling protein nanoparticles has
generated remarkably potent immune responses in non-human primates (Boyoglu-Barnum et
al., 2020; Marcandalli et al., 2019). Recently, I53-50NPs presenting the RBD of SARS-CoV-2
induced potent NAb titers and significantly decreased viral loads in humanized mice (Walls et
al., 2020b). Here, we show that I53-50NPs presenting twenty copies of pre-fusion SARS-CoV2 S protein induce robust NAb responses in mice, rabbits and cynomolgus macaques.
Vaccination of the latter prevented lymphopenia and significantly reduced viral loads and
replication in both the upper and lower respiratory tract, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 S-I5350NPs could reduce the risk of severe SARS-CoV-2-associated pathology in vaccinated
humans and control viral shedding and transmission.
Evidence is mounting that NAb titers are the immunological correlate of protection for SARSCoV-2 (Addetia et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020), and it is increasingly accepted that a successful
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine will need to induce potent NAb responses. We observed notable
differences in NAb titers by our vaccine and previously described candidates, although
comparisons may be biased by, differences in vaccination schedules, assay variability and
inconsistencies in data presentation. Here, SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NP vaccinated macaques
neutralized authentic virus with a median ID50 of approximately 4,000 after the final
immunization, while NAb titers induced by adenovirus vector vaccines (ChAdOx1 (van
Doremalen et al., 2020) and Janssen (Mercado et al., 2020)), DNA vaccines (Yu et al. (Yu et
al., 2020) and Inovio (Patel et al., 2020)), and inactivated vaccines (Sinopharm (Wang et al.,
2020) and Sinovacc (Gao et al., 2020)) were at least 10-fold lower. However, NAb titers
induced by SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs were similar to Moderna’s mRNA vaccine (Corbett et
al., 2020) and lower than Novavax’ and Clover Biopharmaceuticals’ protein vaccines (Corbett
et al., 2020; Guebre-Xabier et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2020).
Besides protecting an individual from COVID-19, a key component of an effective SARS-CoV2 vaccine will be its ability to prevent viral transmission. Hence, sgRNA levels in the upper and

lower airways are valuable endpoints in the evaluation of vaccine candidates. Similar to the
Janssen and Novavax vaccines, vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs decreased
median sgRNA to undetectable levels in the upper airways of all vaccinated animals within 5
dpe, while several other vaccines were unsuccessful in achieving such an effect (van
Doremalen et al., 2020; Patel et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020). One should consider that the
Janssen and Novavax studies used 10- to 100-fold lower challenge doses than used here.
Even though three immunizations were used in our vaccine regimen, the high NAb titers at
week 6 indicate that two immunizations may be sufficient to confer protection. Collectively, the
rapid decrease in sgRNA levels, low level of viral mutations in the S protein, and the absence
of an anamnestic response after challenge, emphasize SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NP
vaccination’s profound ability to control infection and replication.
We propose two factors that may have been responsible for the potent humoral responses
and protective efficacy by SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs. First, the high density of antigen on the
I53-50NPs may have facilitated efficient activation of relevant NAb B cell lineages, which is in
line with previous studies (Antanasijevic et al., 2020; Brouwer et al., 2019), and is supported
by B cell activation experiments described here. Second, by using an S protein that has been
stabilized in the prefusion state, we have likely improved the conformation of key NAb epitopes
(such as the RBD) and decreased the exposure of non-NAb epitopes. Indeed, it has recently
been shown that introduction of the two appropriately positioned prolines and removal of the
polybasic-cleavage site significantly improved the protective ability of an S protein vaccine
(Amanat et al., 2020). Nonetheless, these mutations alone might not be sufficient to generate
stable trimeric S proteins and introducing additional stabilizing mutations, such as the
previously described HexaPro mutations (Hsieh et al., 2020), may further improve the SARSCoV-2 S-I53-50NP-induced humoral responses. Recently, nasal immunization has been
shown to dramatically improve SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy over intramuscular dosing
(Hassan et al., 2020). Using this alternative administration route may allow SARS-CoV-2 SI53-50NPs to elicit protective NAb titers in the mucosa and could advance its protective
efficacy towards fully sterilizing immunity.

Materials and Methods
Construct design
To create the SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50A.1NT1 construct, the previously described pPPI4
plasmid encoding the prefusion SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Brouwer et al., 2020) was digested
with PstI and BamHI and ligated in a PstI-BamHI-digested pPPI4 plasmid encoding a modified
I53-50A.1NT1 sequence. The original I53-50A.1NT1 plasmid was described previously
(Brouwer et al., 2019). Modifications constitute the introduction of GSLEHHHHHH after the
final residue to introduce a C-terminal histidine-tag. For ELISAs, Luminex assays, and
ELISpots histidine-tagged versions of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and RBD were used, as
previously described (Brouwer et al., 2020). To generate S proteins for FACS analyses, the
previously described pPPI4 plasmid, encoding a prefusion S ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2
followed by an Avi- and histidine tag, was used. The RBD probe was generated by digesting
this plasmid with PstI-BamHI and introducing, by Gibson assembly, a gene encoding the RBD
(residues 319-541) directly downstream of a TPA leader sequence.
Protein expression and purification
All constructs were expressed by transient transfection of HEK 293F cells (Invitrogen)
maintained in Freestyle medium (Life Technologies) at a density of 0.8-1.2 million cells/mL.
On the day of transfection, a mix of PEImax (1 µg/µL) with expression plasmids (312.5 µg/L)
in a 3:1 ratio in OptiMEM (Gibco) were added to the cells. Six days post transfection,
supernatants were centrifuged for 30 min at 4000 rpm, filtered using 0.22 µm Steritop filters
(Merck Millipore), and subjected to affinity purification using Ni-NTA agarose beads. Protein
eluates were then concentrated and buffer exchanged to PBS using Vivaspin filters with the
appropriate molecular weight cutoff (GE Healthcare). Protein concentrations were determined
by the Nanodrop method using the proteins peptidic molecular weight and extinction
coefficient as determined by the online ExPASy software (ProtParam).
SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NP assembly
Ni-NTA eluates of SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50A.1NT1 (expressed as described above) were buffer
exchanged to Tris-buffer-saline (TBS), sterile filtered (0.22 µm) and applied to a Superose 6
increase 10/300 GL column (GE healthcare) in TBS supplemented with 5% glycerol. Size
exclusion fractions between 12-14 mL were pooled and equimolar amounts of I53-50B.4PT1,
expressed and purified as described elsewhere (Walls et al., 2020b), was added. After an
overnight incubation at 4°C, the assembly mix was applied to a Superose 6 increase 10/300
GL column in TBS+5% glycerol to remove unassembled components. Fractions
corresponding to assembled SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NPs (8.5-9.5 mL) were collected and
concentrated using Vivaspin columns with a molecular weight cutoff of 10,000 kDa (GE
Healthcare). Protein concentrations were determined by the Nanodrop method using the
proteins peptidic molecular weight and extinction coefficient as determined by the online
ExPASy software (ProtParam).
BN-PAGE analysis
BN-PAGE was performed as described previously (de Taeye et al., 2015). Briefly, 2.5 µg of
S protein was mixed with loading dye and run on a 4-12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen).
Negative-stain EM
SARS-CoV-2 S-153-50NPs were added to carbon-covered 400 mesh copper grids and
stained with 2% uranyl formate. Micrographs were imaged on a Tecnai F12 Spirit microscope
with a 4k FEI Eagle CCD. Leginon (Potter et al., 1999) and Appion (Lander et al., 2009) were
used to collect and process micrographs.
BLI assay

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.07.365726; this version posted November 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this

SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50A.1NT1 and SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NP were diluted to 100 nM and
5nM, respectively, in BLI running buffer (PBS/0.1% bovine serum albumin/0.02% Tween20)
and antibody binding was assessed using a ForteBio Octet K2. The binding assays were
performed at 30°C and with agitation set at 1000 rpm. Antibody was loaded on protein A
sensors (ForteBio) at 10 μg/mL in running buffer until a binding threshold of 1 nm was reached.
Association and dissociation were measured for 300 s.
Glycopeptide analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
Gycopeptide analysis was essentially performed as described previously (Watanabe et al.,
2020). A 30 μg aliquot of SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50A.1NT1 was denatured, alkylated, reduced
and cleaved by the proteases trypsin, chymotrypsin and alpha-lytic protease. Clean-up of the
resulting peptide/glycopeptides was performed using C18 Zip-tips and the sample was
analysed by nanoLC-ESI MS with an Easy-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) system
coupled to a Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using higher energy
collision-induced dissociation (HCD) fragmentation. Peptides were separated using an
EasySpray PepMap RSLC C18 column (75 µm × 75 cm). Glycopeptide fragmentation data
were extracted from the raw file using ByonicTM (Version 3.5) and ByologicTM software (Version
3.5; Protein Metrics Inc.).
Generation of B cells that stably express COVID-specific B cell receptors
The B cell specific expression plasmid was constructed by exchanging the gl2-1261 gene of
the pRRL EuB29 gl2-1261 IgGTM.BCR.GFP.WPRE plasmid (McGuire et al., 2014) with heavy
and light chain genes of either COVA1-18 and COVA2-15 using Gibson assembly (Integrated
DNA Technologies). The production of lentivirus in HEK 293T and the subsequent
transduction was conducted as described elsewhere (ter Brake et al., 2006). In short,
lentiviruses were produced by co-transfecting the expression plasmid with pMDL, pVSV-g and
pRSV-Rev into HEK 293T cells using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Two days post
transfection, IgM-negative Ramos B cells cultured in RPMI (Gibco) supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum, streptomycin (100 µg/mL) and penicillin (100 U/mL) (RPMI++) were
transduced with filtered (0.45 μm) and concentrated (100 kDa molecular weight cutoff, GE
Healthcare) HEK 293T supernatant. Seven days post transduction, BCR-expressing B cells
were FACS sorted on IgG and GFP double-positivity using a FACS Aria-II SORP (BD
biosciences). B cells were then expanded and cultured indefinitely.
B cell activation assay
B cell activation experiments of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific Ramos B cells were performed
as previously described (Brouwer et al., 2019; Sliepen et al., 2019). In short, 4 million cells/mL
in RPMI++ were loaded with 1.5 µM of the calcium indicator Indo-1 (Invitrogen) for 30 min at
37°C, washed with Hank’s Balance Salt Solution supplemented with 2 mM CaCl2, followed by
another incubation of 30 min at 37°C. Antigen-induced Ca2+ influx of COVID-specific B cells
were monitored on a LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences) by measuring the 379/450 nm emission
ratio of Indo-1 fluorescence upon UV excitation. Following 30 s of baseline measurement,
aliquots of 1 million cells/mL were then stimulated for 100 s at RT with either 5 µg/mL, 1 µg/mL,
200 ng/mL or 40 ng/mL of SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50A.1NT1 or the equimolar amount presented
on I53-50NPs. Ionomycin (Invitrogen) was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL to
determine the maximum Indo-1-fluorescence. Kinetics analyses were performed using FlowJo
v10.7.

and Education Ministry” under registration number APAFIS#24434-2020030216532863v1.
Female New Zealand White rabbits of 2.5-3 kg from multiple litters were used. Animals were
sourced and housed at Covance Research Products, Inc. (Denver, PA, USA) and
immunizations were performed under permits with approval number C0084-20. Immunization
procedures complied with all relevant ethical regulations and protocols of the Covance
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Female Balb/c mice were housed at the Animal Research Institute Amsterdam under BSL-2
conditions. All experiments were performed in accordance with the Dutch Experiment on
Animals Act and were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Amsterdam UMC
(Permit number 17-4045).
Animals and study designs
Cynomolgus macaques were randomly assigned in two experimental groups. The vaccinated
group (n=6) received 50 ug of SARS-CoV-2 S-I53-50NP adjuvanted with 500 µg of MPLA
liposomes (Polymun Scientific, Klosterneuburg, Austria) diluted in PBS at weeks 0, 4 and 10,
while control animals (n=4) received no vaccination. Vaccinated animals were sampled in
blood, nasal swabs and saliva at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. At week 12, all animals were
exposed to a total dose of 106 pfu of SARS-CoV-2 virus via the combination of intranasal and
intra-tracheal routes (day 0), using atropine (0.04 mg/kg) for pre-medication and ketamine (5
mg/kg) with medetomidine (0.042 mg/kg) for anesthesia. Saliva, as well as nasopharyngeal,
tracheal and rectal swabs, were collected at days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 14 and 21 days past
exposure (dpe) while blood was taken at days 2, 4, 6, 10, 14 and 21 dpe. Bronchoalveolar
lavages were performed using 50 mL sterile saline on 3 dpe. Chest CT was performed at
baseline and on 3, 7 and 14 dpe in anesthetized animals using tiletamine (4 mg/kg) and
zolazepam (4 mg/kg). Blood cell counts, haemoglobin and haematocrit were determined from
EDTA blood using a HMX A/L analyzer (Beckman Coulter).
Female New Zealand White rabbits were given two intramuscular immunizations, one in each
quadricep, at weeks 0, 4, and 12. The immunization mixture involved 39 µg of SARS-CoV-2S-I53-50NPs (equal to 30 µg of SARS-CoV-2-S) formulated 1:1 in Squalene Emulsion
adjuvant (Polymun, Klosterneuburg, Austria). The rabbits were bled on the day of
immunization and then at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 14.
Twelve week old female Balb/c mice received subcutaneous immunizations into the neck skinfold at weeks 0, 4, and 12. The immunization mixture contained 13 µg of SARS-CoV-2-S-I5350NPs (equal to 10 µg of SARS-CoV-2-S) adjuvanted with 50 µg of polyinosinic-polycytidylic
acid (Poly-IC; Invivogen). Blood was collected at weeks -1, 2, 6 and 14. Two out of eight mice
were sacrificed at week 6 to allow interim analysis of the induced humoral response.
Patient samples
Sera were collected through the COVID-19 Specific Antibodies (COSCA) study, which was
performed as described previously at the Amsterdam University Medical Centre, location
AMC, the Netherlands under approval of the local ethical committee of the AMC (NL
73281.018.20) (Brouwer et al., 2020). Briefly, patients with at least one nasopharyngeal swab
positive for SARS-CoV-2 as determined by qRT-PCR (Roche LightCycler480, targeting the
Envelope-gene 113bp) were included. A venipuncture was performed to obtain blood for
serum collection approximately four weeks after onset of COVID-19 symptoms.

ELISAs
Ni-NTA plates (Qiagen) were loaded with 2 µg/mL of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in TBS for 2 h at
RT. Next, washed plates were blocked for 1 h with TBS/2% skimmed milk. Four-fold serial
dilutions of inactivated sera, starting from a 1:200 dilution for mice and rabbit sera, and 1:100
dilution for macaque sera, were added in TBS/2% skimmed milk/20% sheep serum and
incubated for 2 h at RT. Following plate washing, a 1:3000 dilution of secondary antibody in
TBS/2% skimmed milk was added for 1 h at RT. For mice, rabbit and macaque sera
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-mice IgG, HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG
and HRP-labeled goat anti-human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) was used, respectively.
Finally, after washing plates with TBS/0.05% Tween-20, developing solution (1% 3,3’,5,5’tetranethylbenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.01% H2O2, 100 mM sodium acetate and 100 mM citric
acid) was added to each well and a colorimetric endpoint was obtained by adding 0.8 M H2SO4
after 1.5 min. Binding endpoint titers were determined using a cutoff of 5x background.
As affinity differences between species-specific secondary Abs may bias comparisons
between endpoint titers of macaque and convalescent human sera, we used a different ELISA
setup to compare S protein- and RBD-specific binding responses. Specifically, ELISA binding
responses are compared to a standard curve of species-specific polyclonal IgG so that a semiquantitative measure of specific IgG concentrations can be obtained. High-binding plates were
direct-coated overnight at 4°C with 2 µg/mL of SARS-CoV-2 S protein or 0.4 µg/mL of SARSCoV-2 RBD in PBS. For capture of the standard curve (i.e. macaque and human polyclonal
IgG), plates were coated with 1:2000 (for capture of polyclonal macaque IgG) or 1:1000 (for
capture of polyclonal human IgG) of goat anti-Human IgG λ and κ (Southern Biotech). The
next day, plates were washed with TBS than contained 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) and blocked
for 1 h with Casein buffer (ThermoScientific). A 1:100, 1:1000 and 1:10,000 dilution of
macaque or human serum in Casein buffer were then added to the wells containing S protein
or RBD. Five-fold serial dilutions of polyclonal macaque (Molecular Innovations) or human
IgG, starting at a concentration of 1 µg/mL, were added to wells containing the coated goat
anti-Human IgG λ and κ. Standards and samples were applied in duplicate. Following a 1 h
incubation at RT, the plates were washed with TBST and secondary antibody diluted in Casein
buffer was added for 1 h. For the plates containing human sera and standard, a 1:3000 dilution
of HRP-labeled goat anti-human IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) was used. For plates
containing macaque sera and standard, a 1:50,000 dilution of biotinylated mouse anti-monkey
IgG was used (Southern Biotech), followed by a 1 h incubation with a 1:3000 dilution of HRPlabeled streptavidin (Biolegend) in Casein. Finally, after washing plates with TBST, developing
solution (1% 3,3’,5,5’-tetranethylbenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.01% H2O2, 100 mM sodium
acetate and 100 mM citric acid) was added to each well and a colorimetric endpoint was
obtained by adding 0.8 M H2SO4 after 5 min. OD450-values that fell within the linear range of
the standard curve were fitted and the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 S protein- and RBDspecific IgG was determined.
Pseudovirus neutralization assay
Neutralization assays and the generation of a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus containing a
NanoLuc luciferase reporter gene were performed as described elsewhere (Schmidt et al.,
2020). Briefly, HEK 293T cells (ATCC, CRL-11268) were transfected with a pHIV-1NL43∆ENVNanoLuc reporter virus plasmid and a SARS-CoV-2-S∆19 plasmid. Cell supernatant containing
the pseudoviruses was harvested 48 h post transfection, centrifuged for 5 min at 500 x g and
sterile filtered through a 0.22 µm pore size PVDF syringe filter. For neutralization assays HEK
293T expressing the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 (HEK 293T/ACE2) were cultured in DMEM
(Gibco), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/mL), and
streptomycin (100 µg/mL).To determine the neutralization activity in serum, saliva or
nasopharyngeal samples, HEK 293T/ACE2 cells were first seeded in 96-well plates coated
with 50 µg/mL poly-l-lysine at a density of 2x104/well in the culture medium described above
but with GlutaMax (Gibco) added. The next day, duplicate serial dilutions of heat inactivated
samples were prepared in the same medium as used for seeding of cells and mixed 1:1 with

pseudovirus. This mixture was incubated at 37°C for 1 h before adding it to the HEK
293T/ACE2 cells in a 1:1 ratio with the cell culture medium. After 48 h, the cells were lysed
and luciferase activity was measured in the lysates using the Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay
System (Promega). Relative luminescence units (RLU) were normalized to those from cells
infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in the absence of sera/saliva/swabs. Neutralization
titers (ID50-values) were determined as the serum dilution at which infectivity was inhibited by
50%.
Authentic virus neutralization assay
Serum samples were tested for their neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 (German
isolate; GISAID ID EPI_ISL 406862; European Virus Archive Global #026V-03883) as
described previously (Okba et al., 2020). In short, serum samples were serially diluted in 50
µL Opti-MEM I (Gibco), supplemented with GlutaMAX (Gibco) and 100 U/mL penicillin. Serum
dilutions were mixed with 400 plaque-forming units of virus to a total of 100 µL. This mixture
was incubated at 37°C for 1 h. After incubation, the mixtures were put on Vero-E6 cells (ATCC
CRL-1586) and incubated for 1 h. Cells were then washed, Opti-MEM I supplemented with
GlutaMAX (Gibco) was added, and incubated for 8 h. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde
in PBS and stained with polyclonal rabbit anti-SARS-CoV Ab (Sino Biological) and secondary
Alexa488 conjugated goat-anti-rabbit Ab (Invitrogen). Plates were scanned on the
Amersham™ Typhoon™ Biomolecular Imager (channel Cy2; resolution 10 µm; GE
Healthcare). Data was analyzed using ImageQuant TL 8.2 image analysis software (GE
Healthcare).
Protein coupling to Luminex beads
Proteins were covalently coupled to Magplex beads (Luminex Corporation) using a two-step
carbodiimide reaction and a ratio of 75 µg protein SARS-CoV-2 S protein to 12,5 million beads.
Magplex beads (Luminex Corporation) were washed with 100 mM monobasic sodium
phosphate pH 6.2, activated for 30 min on a rotor at RT by addition of Sulfo-NHydroxysulfosuccinimide (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)
carbodiimide (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The activated beads were washed three times with
50 mM MES pH 5.0 and added to SARS-CoV-2 S protein which was diluted in 50 mM MES
pH 5.0. The beads and protein were incubated for 3 h on a rotator at RT. Afterwards, the
beads were washed with PBS and blocked with PBS containing 0.1% BSA, 0.02% Tween-20
and 0.05% Sodium Azide at pH 7.0 for 30 min on a rotator at RT. Finally, the beads were
washed and stored in PBS containing 0.05% Sodium Azide at 4°C and used within 3 months.
Luminex assays
50 µL of a working bead mixture containing 20 beads per µL was incubated overnight at 4°C
with 50 µL of diluted serum, saliva or nasopharyngeal swab. Pilot experiments determined the
optimal dilution for detection of SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies
in serum to be 1:50,000, for the detection of antibody binding to FcγRIIa, FcγRIIIa and C1q in
serum at 1:500 and for detection of S protein-specific IgG and IgA in saliva and nose fluid at
1:20. Plates were sealed and incubated on a plate shaker overnight at 4°C. The next day,
plates were washed with TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) using a hand-held magnetic
separator. Beads were resuspended in 50 µL of Goat-anti-human IgG-PE, Goat-anti human
IgA-PE or Mouse-anti human IgM-PE (Southern Biotech) and incubated on a plate shaker at
RT for 2 h. For C1q binding, beads were resuspended in 50 µL purified human C1q
(Complement Technology, Inc.), which was biotinylated and conjugated to Streptavidin-PE.
For the detection of FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa binding, beads were resuspended in 50 µL
biotinylated human FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa ectodomain dimers (courtesy of Bruce Wines and
Mark Hogarth) for 2 h incubation, after which the beads were washed with TBST and then
incubated with 50 µL Streptavidin-PE (Invitrogen) on a plate shaker for 1 h. Afterwards, the
beads were washed with TBST and resuspended in 110 µL Bioplex sheath fluid (Bio-Rad).
The beads were agitated for a few minutes on a plate shaker at RT and then read-out was
performed on the Bioplex 200 (Bio-Rad). Resulting mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values

were corrected by subtraction of MFI values from buffer and beads only wells. Relative MFI
values were obtained by dividing the MFI by the background MFI at week 0. Reproducibility of
the results was confirmed by performing replicate runs.
SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific Tfh cell analysis using an activation induced marker (AIM)
assay
The AIM assay was performed as previously described (Reiss et al., 2017). Cryopreserved
macaque PBMCs from 2 weeks after final immunization (week 12) were thawed and counted.
1x106 cells per condition were plated in 96 U-shape well plates (CELLSTAR, Kremsmünster)
and rested for 2-3 h in RPMI (Gibco), supplemented with 10% FBS. Subsequently, cells were
incubated with 0.5 mg/mL anti-CD40 (Miltenyi Biotec) for 15 min at 37°C, to prevent
downregulation of CD40 ligand (CD40L) by blocking CD40-CD40L interaction. PBMCs were
stimulated for 18 h at 37°C with 5 mg/mL SARS-CoV-2 S protein. As a negative control no
stimulants were added, and as a positive control 1 mg/mL Staphylococcal enterotoxin B was
used. Thereafter, PBMCs were washed using FACS buffer (PBS, supplemented with 1%
FBS). PBMCs were then incubated with the Tfh-specific chemokine receptor antibody CXCR5
PE-Cy7 (MU5UBEE; eBioscience) for 10 min at 37°C. Next, the following antibodies and
viability dye were incubated with PBMCs at RT for 20 min: anti-CD3 BUV395 (clone SP34-2;
BD Biosciences), anti-CD4 BUV495 (clone SK3; BD Biosciences), anti-CD154 BV421 (clone
TRAP1; BD Biosciences), anti-CD69 BV785 (clone FN50; BD Biosciences), and LiveDeadeF780 (eBioscience). Cells were washed twice with FACS buffer before acquisition on the BD
Fortessa II flow cytometer (BD biosciences). Analysis was performed on FlowJo v.10.7.1.
SARS-CoV-2 S protein- and RBD-specific B cell analysis
Biotinylated SARS-CoV-2 S protein and RBD were conjugated to streptavidin bound
fluorophores. Briefly, the biotinylated proteins were incubated for a minimum of 1 h at 4°C with
the streptavidin-conjugates AF647 (Biolegend), BV421 (Biolegend) and BB515 (BD
Biosciences) at a 1:2 protein to fluorochrome ratio. The fluorescent probes were incubated for
at least 10 min with 10mM biotin (GeneCopoeia) to saturate the unconjugated streptavidinfluorochrome complexes. Cryopreserved macaque PBMCs from 2 weeks after final
immunization (week 12) were thawed and counted. 5x106 cells were stained for 30 min at 4°C
with the fluorescent probes, a viability marker (LiveDead-eF780, eBiosciences) and the
following B cell-specific antibodies: anti-CD20-PE-CF594 (2H7; BD Biosciences), anti-IgGPE-Cy7 (G18-145;BD Biosciences), anti-CD27-PE (M-T271; BD Biosciences), and anti-IgMBV605 (MHM-88; Biolegend). Cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and acquired on the
FACS-ARIA-SORP 4 laser (BD Biosciences). Analysis was performed on FlowJo v.10.7.1.
Viruses and cells
For the cynomolgus macaque challenge study, SARS-CoV-2 virus (hCoV-19/France/
lDF0372/2020 strain) was isolated by the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses
(Institut Pasteur, Paris, France) as described recently (Lescure et al., 2020). Virus stocks used
in vivo were produced by two passages on Vero E6 cells in DMEM (Gibco) without FBS,
supplemented with penicillin at 100 U/mL, streptomycin at 100 μg/mL, and 1 μg/mL TPCKtrypsin at 37°C in a humidified CO2 incubator and titrated on Vero E6 cells.
Virus quantification in cynomolgus macaque samples
Upper respiratory (nasopharyngeal and tracheal) and rectal specimens were collected with
swabs (Viral Transport Medium, CDC, DSR-052-01). Tracheal swabs were performed by
insertion of the swab above the tip of the epiglottis into the upper trachea at approximately 1.5
cm of the epiglottis. All specimens were stored between 2°C and 8°C until analysis by RTqPCR with a plasmid standard concentration range containing an RdRp gene fragment
including the RdRp-IP4 RT-PCR target sequence. SARS-CoV-2 E gene subgenomic mRNA
(sgmRNA) levels were assessed by RT-qPCR using primers and probes previously described
(Corman et al., 2020; Wölfel et al., 2020): leader-specific primer sgLeadSARSCoV2-F

and E-Sarbeco probe HEX-ACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGCGCTTCG-BHQ1. The protocol
describing the procedure for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 is available on the WHO website
(https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/real-time-rt-pcr-assays-for-thedetection-of-sars-cov-2-institut-pasteur-paris.pdf?sfvrsn=3662fcb6_2).
Chest computed tomography and image analysis
Acquisition was done using a computed tomography (CT) system (Vereos-Ingenuity, Philips)
as previously described (Maisonnasse et al., 2020). Lesions were defined as ground glass
opacity, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation or pleural thickening as previously described (Pan
et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020). Lesions and scoring were assessed in each lung lobe blindly
and independently by two persons and final results were made by consensus. Overall CT
scores include the lesion type (scored from 0 to 3) and lesion volume (scored from 0 to 4)
summed for each lobe as previously described (Maisonnasse et al., 2020).
ELISpot assays
IFNγ ELISpot assay of PBMCs was performed using the Monkey IFNγ ELISpot PRO kit
(Mabtech Monkey IFNγ ELISPOT pro, #3421M-2APT) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. PBMCs were plated at a concentration of 200,000 cells per well and were
stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 S protein at a final concentration of 5 μg/mL. Plates were
incubated for 42 h at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2, then washed 5 times with
PBS and incubated for 2 h at 37°C with a biotinylated anti-IFNγ antibody. After 5 washes,
spots were developed by adding 0.45 µm-filtered ready-to-use BCIP/NBT-plus substrate
solution and counted with an automated ELISpot reader ELRIFL04 (Autoimmun Diagnostika
GmbH, Strassberg, Germany). Spot forming units (SFU) per 1.0x106 PBMCs are means of
duplicates for each animal.
Viral sequencing
30 RNA samples from nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage at day 3 and 5 were selected
for sequencing. cDNA and multiplex PCR reactions were prepared following the ARTIC SARSCoV-2 sequencing protocol v2 (Tyson et al., 2020). The inoculum was also sequenced. V3
primer scheme (https://github.com/artic-network/primer-schemes/tree/master/nCoV-2019/V3)
was used to perform the multiplex PCR for SARS-CoV-2. All samples were run for 35 cycles
in the two multiplex PCRs. Pooled and cleaned PCR reactions were quantified using QubitTM
fluorometer (Invitrogen). The Ligation Sequencing kit (SQK-LSK109; Oxford Nanopore
Technologies) was used to prepare the library following the manufacturer's protocol ("PCR
tiling of COVID-19 virus", release F; Oxford Nanopore Technologies). 24 samples were
multiplexed using Native Barcoding Expansion 1-12 and Native Barcoding Expansion 13-24
kits (EXP-NBD104 and EXP-NBD114; Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Two libraries of 24
samples were prepared independently and quantified by QubitTM fluorometer (Invitrogen).
After the quality control, two R9.4 flowcells (FLO-MIN106; Oxford Nanopore Technologies)
were primed as described in the manufacturer's protocol and loaded with 45 and 32 ng of
library. Sequencing was performed on a GridION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) for 72 h
with high-accuracy Guppy basecalling (v3.2.10). After sequencing, demultiplexing was
performed using Guppy v4.0.14 with the option --require_barcodes_both_ends to ensure high
quality demultiplexing. Reads were then filtered by Nanoplot v1.28.1 based on length and
quality to select high quality reads. Then, reads were aligned on the SARS-CoV-2 reference
genome NC_045512.2 using minimap2 v2.17. Primary alignments were filtered based on
reads length alignment and reads identity. Finally, variant calling was performed with Longshot
v0.4.1. Identified variants were then analyzed using in-house scripts. Variants absent from the
inoculum but present in one or more samples were selected for further analysis.
Statistical analysis
Binding titers (endpoint titers and concentrations) and midpoint neutralization titers were
determined using Graphpad Prism 7.0. Comparisons between two experimental groups were
made using a Mann-Whitney U test (Excel 2016, Graphpad Prism 7.0).
