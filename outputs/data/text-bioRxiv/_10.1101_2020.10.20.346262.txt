Summary

93
94

Establishing new experimental animal models to assess the safety and immune response

95

to the antigen used in the development of COVID-19 vaccine is an imperative issue.

96

Based on the advantages of using zebrafish as a model in research, herein we suggest

97

doing this to test the safety of the putative vaccine candidates and to study immune

98

response against the virus. We produced a recombinant N-terminal fraction of the Spike

99

SARS-CoV-2 protein and injected it into adult female zebrafish. The specimens

100

generated humoral immunity and passed the antibodies to the eggs. However, they

101

presented adverse reactions and inflammatory responses similar to severe cases of

102

human COVID-19. The analysis of the structure and function of zebrafish and human

103

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the main human receptor for virus infection,

104

presented remarkable sequence similarities. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis predicted

105

protein-protein interaction of the Spike SARS-CoV-2 fragment and the Toll-like

106

receptor pathway. It might help in the choice of future therapeutic pharmaceutical drugs

107

to be studied. Based on the in vivo and in silico results presented here, we propose the

108

zebrafish as a model for translational research into the safety of the vaccine and the

109

immune response of the vertebrate organism to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Introduction

127

The World Health Organization (WHO) registered, on January 30th, 2020, that

128

the outbreak of the disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus

129

2 (SARS-CoV-2) constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Importance

130

(the highest level of alert from the Organization)1. Since then, the number of

131

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases outside China has increased significantly

132

worldwide, resulting in the deaths of approximately 1,108,000 of the nearly 40 million

133

infected people through October1. The current coronavirus pandemic has had drastic

134

consequences for the world’s population, not only in terms of the public health system

135

but also in causing a major global economic crisis. Diagnostic tests, efficient and safe

136

vaccines, and new effective antivirals are urgently required2.

137

SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is found on the surface of the virus, giving it a

138

“crown” appearance, and binds human (Homo sapiens) Angiotensin-converting enzyme

139

2 (ACE2) to infect human cells7. Moreover, the Spike protein is one of the likely

140

targetsfor vaccine production, and the antibodies against it could be used for SARS-

141

CoV-2 antigen rapid test production. To investigate the production of specific

142

antibodies against the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in a zebrafish (Danio rerio) model,

143

we inoculated an N-terminal region of SARS-CoV-2 Spike recombinant protein

144

(residues 16-165) in adult female specimens. In humans, protection conferred by natural

145

infection or passive immunization are unclear1. However, in teleost fish, including the

146

zebrafish, antibodies constitute a major proportion of the functional passive immunity

147

that is aquired maternally. Although maternal Abs are transferred to the fetus through

148

the placenta in mammals, in almost all teleost fish, Abs are transferred to the yolk2. This

149

suggests that by injecting the recombinant spike protein abundant antibodies could be

150

obtained simply by extracting the antibodies from the eggs produced by a single adult

151

female zebrafish. The second goal of this work was to demonstrate that the zebrafish

152

could be a new alternative model to test preclinical vaccine candidates for COVID-19,

153

prospecting a strategy to assess safety and toxicity for vaccine candidates. The

154

comparison between zebrafish and human genomes revealed remarkable sequence and

155

functional conservation of 70% genetic similarity to humans3,4. Zebrafish have been

156

used as a model to study the safety of vaccines5 and to assess toxicology that could be

157

correlated to human health6,7. Recently, the WHO (2020) prepared a document on all

158

vaccine candidates for COVID-19 clinical trials, reporting 35 candidate vaccines in the
39

159

clinical evaluation and at least 166 vaccine candidates in preclinical and clinical

160

development. Normally, the development of a vaccine takes 10 to 15 years for

161

conclusion. However, the case of COVID-19 meets a new pandemic paradigm and the

162

development of the vaccine has been proposed to be reduced to 1-2 years8.

163

It is worth mentioning that before vaccine clinical tests begin, several safety

164

protocols must be submitted with in vitro and in vivo experiments on animal models.

165

There is a lack of information regarding the immune response of the organism to SARS-

166

CoV-2, including animal models to study it9. Although zebrafish do not have lungs as

167

humans do, the present study shows similar inflammatory responses observed in severe

168

cases of COVID-19 patients that could be considered when investigating human

169

responses to the virus.

170

In the global task to develop the vaccine and possible therapeutic approaches for

171

COVID-19, several animal models have been proposed, such as mice10, hACE2

172

transgenic mice11, alpaca12, golden Syrian hamsters, ferrets, dogs, pigs, chickens, and

173

cats9, and species of non-human primates10. Recently, three reports have described the

174

production of equine neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-213,14. A study by Deng

175

and collaborators analyzed serum samples from 35 animal species for the detection of

176

specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-215. Despite this wide search for candidate

177

animal models, so far only two references promote the zebrafish model on this regard

178

confirming the innovative and pioneer characteristics of our study16,17.

179

Here, female zebrafish individuals injected with a N-terminal fraction of SARS-

180

CoV-2 Spike recombinant protein (residues 16-165) produced specific antibodies, and

181

presented suggestive adverse reactions and inflammatory responses resembling the

182

severe cases of COVID-19 human patients. Therefore, with this work we put forward

183

the advantage of using zebrafish as a model for translational research on the vaccine

184

safety and the screening of immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

To induce and analyze the humoral immune response, 3 peptides of full length

192

the peptide named Pep1 (Pep1, residues 16 to 22; Pep2 and Pep3 are shown in

193

Supplemental Figure 1) (Figure 1a-a2), has been chosen because of its promising

194

antigenic potential. It has presented a binding free energy site in protein-ligand

195

interactions for D. rerio MHC II, MHC I, TCR alpha (Figure 1b). Similar results were

196

observed when the same analysis was performed using human orthologous receptors

197

(Figure 1b). Further analysis were carried out based on Dock analysis between Pep15

198

and the structure of MHC II (PDBID), MHC I (PDBID), TCR alpha (PDBID), and TCR

199

beta (PDBID) that showed the similarity of the ligand/Pep1 interaction to the receptor-

200

binding site (Figure 1c). After the in silico examination, specific pathogen free wildtype

201

(AB SPF) adult female zebrafish were injected with a N-terminal fragment of SARS-

202

CoV-2 Spike protein (residues 16 to 165) expressed in Escherichia coli with a N-

203

terminal fusion of six histidine tag and purified from inclusion bodies, herein name

204

rSpike, to determine whether they could produce IgM-class antibodies. In 7 days of

205

immunization, a band corresponding to IgM in the plasma was detected using SDS-

206

PAGE and was also and analyzed by MALDI-ToF. It was two-fold higher than the

207

controls (Figure 1e, g). After 7 days a new immunization using rSpike was done and the

208

IgM level remained higher than the control after 14 days being more evident in IgM of

209

eggs (Figure 1e, g).

210

Docking analysis showed that the zebrafish IgM chain 4 (CH4) share 43.3%

211

sequence similarity to human IgM CH4 (Figure 1d) and might have similar potential to

212

recognize S protein as the human antibody. In parallel, it was tested whether passive

213

antibody transfer to the eggs occurred through immunized females. The bands

214

corresponding to the size of IgM in unfertilized zebrafish eggs were detected in the gel

215

(Figure 1f) and confirmed by protein analysis with MALDI-ToF. It was possible to

216

observe an increase in IgM in eggs compared to the control after 7 days, and it was

217

almost two-fold higher after 14 days of maternal immunization (Figure 1h).

218
219

rSpike protein immunization of zebrafish had an impact on the survival rate

220

Two bioassays were carried out to analyze the toxicity of the rSpike. Although

221

the immunized fish produced antibodies, the first injection of the rSpike generated high

222

toxicity to the fish (Figure 2). Therefore, the assay was repeated by adding different

223

control groups to confirm that the toxicity findings were specific to the rSpike (Figure

224

2). In the first bioassay, after fish immunization with rSpike, the survival rate was

225

78.6% during the first seven days (Figure 2). It was significant when compared to naive

226

control and fish injected with protein buffer (control 1), where the survival rate was

227

100% and 90%, respectively (Figure 2). Nonetheless, after a second immunization, the

228

rSpike immunized group maintained the plateau survival rate, with no statistical

229

significance between the groups for the relative risk of death (Figure 2).

230

Therefore, a second assay was conducted by adding different control groups in

231

order to confirm that the toxicity findings were specific to the rSpike, and related to the

232

presence of any antigen. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis confirmed rSpike injection

233

presented a lower survival rate compared to the two previous controls used (Control

234

naïve and protein buffer) and also compared to females injected with E. coli extract or a

235

culture medium mixed of two purified recombinant proteins (PilZ protein from

236

Xanthomonas citri, and a N-terminal fragment of LIC_11128 from Leptospira

237

interrogans Copenhageni) (Control 2) (Figure 2). The survival rate was maintained after

238

the second immunization for the next seven days. The relative risk of death in the period

239

studied between the groups was significant (chi square = 79.70; p <0.0001).

In order to verify the occurrence of sublethal effects of the rSpike on treated

244

zebrafish, histopathological analysis of different organs, including brain, gonads, heart,

245

kidney, liver, spleen, among others, was performed in female fishes used in the

246

immunization protocol described in material and methods. Animals that died during the

247

immunization experiment were excluded from the analysis. In general, it was observed

248

several morphological alterations compatible with an undergoing inflammatory process

249

in many tissues. Markedly, brain obtained from treated fishes showed an intense

250

inflammatory infiltrate with presence of many macrophages after 7 days (Figure 3c) and

251

an intense mononuclear infiltrate after 14 days (Figure 3d,e). Histopathological analysis

252

of the female reproductive tissue showed ovarian stroma with abundant and

253

disorganized extracellular matrix (Figure 3g). Follicular development showed

254

alterations such as atresia among oocytes at primary growth and cortical alveolus stages

255

(Figure 3g). Moreover, dense inflammatory infiltrates are commonly seen in the ovarian

256

stroma (Figure 3h). On the other hand, the group of fish that received a second injection

257

within the interval of 7 days showed no histological changes in their ovaries after 14

258

days, when compared to controls (Figure 3i). In kidneys, we observed melanin and

259

lipofuscin pigments, renal thrombosis and autophagy with tubular disarray and loss of

260

tubular lumen epithelium, loss of Bowman's capsule space and the integrity of the

261

glomerular tuft compromising blood filtration (Figure 3n,o). The frequency of the

262

relative systemic alterations is summarized in Table 1.

263
264

rSpike protein immunization induces systemic neutrophils and macrophage

265

infiltration in zebrafish

266

Taking together clinical evidences of the immunological effects of rSpike

267

protein and the inflammatory-related alterations in the architecture of treated zebrafish

268

tissue, we then turn to a more detailed investigation of the activation of the immune

269

system upon injection of rSpike protein in zebrafish. The presence of the major

270

inflammatory cells as neutrophils and activated macrophages present in the brain and

271

coelomic cavity of the zebrafish were detected by immunostaining. Antibodies against

272

Lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus G6D (Ly6G), and Allograft inflammatory factor 1

273

(AIF-1/Iba1) were used to identify neutrophils and activated macrophages, respectively.

274

In non-immunized fish (control group), there was no visible staining for AIF-1/Iba1

275

(Figure 4 - panel a3); but there was weak staining for Ly6G in the nervous system and

276

ventral area of the coelomic cavity (Figure 4 panel a4). However, the females injected

277

with rSpike protein presented strong Ly6G and AIF-1/Iba1 staining, indicating an

278

inflammatory response of the organism to the virus protein (Figure 4b). Colocalization

279

between Ly6G and AIF-1/Iba1 was observed with predominance in the peripheral

280

region of the brain and in the portion of the kidney from the head (Figure 4b, field 1).

281

Macrophages and neutrophils were also labeled in large vessels (Figure 4b, field 2). In

282

the coelomic cavity in general, there was an increase of neutrophil (Ly6G) and

283

macrophage (AIF/Iba1) cell infiltration (Figure 4c).

284

The innate immune system and antibody production were detected after rSpike

285

injection in adult zebrafish. The question remained as to whether the fish could respond

286

through cellular immunity, especially T cells. To answer this question, immunostaining

287

revealed the presence of CD-4 and CD-8 cells in the coelomic cavity of female adult

288

zebrafish injected with rSpike (Figure 5).

289
290

The human receptor Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) share 72%

291

sequence similarity to its ortholog in zebrafish

292

One of the known targets of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is the Angiotensin

293

receptor converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in humans. It is considered the main gateway to

294

the virus infection. Considering the effects of rSpike protein on the fishes analyzed in

295

this work, structural and functional similarities between zebrafish and human ACE2

296

were investigated, using bioinformatic analysis. Interestingly, zebrafish has ACE2

297

protein that shares 58 and 72 % primary sequence identity and similarity to human

298

ACE2, respectively (Figure 6; Supplemental Figure 2). Human ACE2 interacts to the

299

receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein mainly by polar and salt

300

bridge interactions. Human ACE2 has 22 residues making part of the protein-protein

301

interaction and most of them are located at the N-terminal region of ACE2. 77% of the

302

human ACE2 residues of the interface are similar in zebrafish ACE2 sequence (Figure

303

6; Supplemental Figure 2) suggesting that zebrafish may also binds SARS-CoV-2 Spike

304

protein. The tree-dimensional structure of zebrafish ACE2 based on homology model

305

(Figure 6a) shows a high structural similarity with human ACE2. Computational

306

analysis of protein-protein interaction using ACE2 and the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 Spike

307

protein reveals similar values of binding free energy suggesting that zebrafish is

308

susceptible to virus infection (Figure 6c). In our work, we do not expect that rSpike

309

protein interacts with zebrafish ACE2 because rSpike correspond to the N-terminal part

310

of the Spike protein (residues 16-165) that precedes the RBD domain (residues 319-

311

541).

318

human proteins and rSpike predicted interactions with 1,785 proteins for the membrane,

319

1,168 proteins for the cytoplasm, and 1,242 proteins for the nucleus (Table 2;

320

Supplementary Table 1). Considering the most general ontological terms found

321

hierarchically, according to the KEGG and Reactome databases, 71% of the terms

322

identified for zebrafish are identical to those found for human. However, further

323

analysis showed different specific terms with approximately 58% of different specific

324

pathways.

325

Functional enrichment of the biological pathways (zebrafish and human) showed

326

basic processes related mainly to cell growth and death, including regulation of

327

transcription and translation mechanisms, mechanisms of DNA repair or replication,

328

and signaling pathways of p53 and by GPCR, among others. Additionally, we identified

329

the pathways related to signal molecules and interactions, signal transduction, and the

330

immune system (Figure 7, Supplementary Table 1).

331

Interestingly, it was recovered through the protein-protein interaction with

332

rSpike, the Toll-like receptor pathway (dre:04620 and hsa:04620). It can allow

333

interaction with the Toll-like receptors TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 and the

334

interferon-α/β receptor (IFNαβR), possibly triggering the activation of various signaling

335

pathways (Figure 8). In this pathway, we observed a possible interaction of the rSpike

336

with the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1-alpha/beta (STAT1) protein in

337

the cytoplasmic region. Additionally, the signal molecules and interaction pathway

338

(zebrafish and human) showed the possibility of rSpike interacting with a considerable

339

number of cell receptors related to the neuroactive ligand receptor (KEGG:4080) and a

340

cytokine-cytokine receptor (Figure 8, KEGG:4060) and triggering diverse cellular

341

signaling such as the TGF beta signaling family, class I and II helical cytokines, IL and

342

TNF family. In addition, proteins related to the extracellular matrix, cellular

343

communication and motility, formation of vesicles, transport and catabolism, VEGF

344

signaling pathway, and AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in diabetic complications,

345

among others, were identified (see Supplementary Table 1).

The possible virus-host protein interactions during the SARS-CoV-2 infection

Discussion

367

Here we show, for the first time, that zebrafish injected with rSpike protein,

368

fragment 16 to 165 (rSpike), that corresponds to the N-terminal portion of the protein,

369

produced an acquired and native immune response and showed adverse effects,

370

following a series of experiments to validate a model of pre-clinical safety studies.

371

The first experiments aimed to analyze the humoral response with antibody

372

production and used, besides the rSpike, the appropriate negative controls as the E. coli

373

extract, mixed of purified recombinant proteins from bacteria, and buffer without the

374

virus protein. There was no increased in computed densitometry of the fragment related

375

to the IgM production in the control groups. Interestingly, the fragment was found only

376

in animals injected with rSpike, demonstrating the specificity of the immune response.

377

Despite the zebrafish systemic antibody production after day 7 of injection of rSpike,

378

the efficiency of these antibodies may have increased on the 14th day, conferring a

379

reduction in the mortality rate of the immunized animals. It was observed using SDS-

380

PAGE that a suggestive time-dependent increase of the fragment correlated with the

381

molecular weight of IgM in zebrafish serum. The results observed in the production of

382

antibodies at 7 and 14 days after inoculation also suggest the similarity to human

383

infected individuals with COVID-1919. Antibody production was found in the serum,

384

and in the eggs as well (Figure 1).

385

In the literature, the passive transfer of antibodies to eggs is known in zebrafish

386

and other teleosts20. It has also been described as a strategy for immunization in

387

aquaculture to farmed fish2. In evolution, the passive transfer of antibodies protects the

388

offspring from fish to mammals, along with other groups of tetrapods2,21. Although in

389

mammals, the IgG is transferred through the placenta and breast milk, in fish the IgM

390

plays this role in the yolk21. Similarly, in humans, the presence of SARS-CoV-2

391

antibodies in breast milk has been found to provide passive immunity for children, to

392

protect them22,23. In this sense, the antibody transfer shown in zebrafish could be helpful

393

in future studies to understand the maternal immunological protection of descendants

394

against SARS-CoV-2 or any other vaccine candidates. Also, measuring antibodies

395

against the rSpike in plasma and egg demonstrates great potential for the use of

396

zebrafish in the early stages (phases I and II) of the development and use of these

397

antibodies in therapeutics and prophylactics for humans24,25.

398

Interestingly, fish injected with rSpike produced a toxic inflammatory response

399

with similarity to severe cases of COVID-19 in humans (Figure 2 and 3). Different

400

systems were affected, including the nervous system. The first hint of rSpike toxicity

401

was the distinct swimming behavior that adult females presented after the protein

402

injection. In fact, some recent studies have reported that the SARS-CoV-2 may affect

403

the nervous system26–28 as the peripheral nervous system29–31, particularly in the most

404

severe cases of infection32.

405

In our study, the rSpike was responsible for generating an inflammatory process

406

in the brain, characterized by an intense influx of mononuclear cells, but no

407

histopathological lesions. This profile is in line with the clinical reports of COVID-19-

408

associated acute necrotizing myelitis33, where lymphocytic pleocytosis was observed in

409

the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Acute transverse myelitis related to SARS-CoV-2

410

infection24, where an intense leukocyte infiltrate of monocytic characteristic and

411

elevated protein level was also observed in the CSF. In another report, thrombosis in

412

superficial and deep systems, straight sinus, the vein of Galen, internal cerebral veins,
47

413

and thrombosis of the deep medullary veins were found27. Damage to the structure and

414

function of this system can lead to severe encephalitis, toxic encephalopathy, and, after

415

viral infections, severe acute demyelinating lesions34. In a case study of 4 children with

416

COVID-19, Abdel-Mannan and collaborators reported that children with COVID-19

417

may have late neurological symptoms35. Future studies with zebrafish might provide

418

more information about the virus damage in the nervous system.

419

To date, we do not know how the rSpike can cause neurological effects. It is

420

possible that the immune system can recognize these sequence of amino acids. The in

421

silico analysis of the rSpike used in the present study indicated that it might interact in a

422

protein-protein level with the Toll-like receptor pathway. In this pathway, the Jak/Stat

423

signaling in humans has been demonstrated to be activated in response to SARS-CoV-2

424

infection by the release of interleukin IL-636,37. Interestingly, our prediction showed the

425

possible interaction of the rSpike with the signal transducer and activator of

426

transcription 1-alpha/beta (STAT1) protein in the cytoplasmic region, which acts as a

427

carrier for the nucleus and, consequently, executes its function in the inflammatory

428

response as a transcription factor38–40. In addition, a study in mice showed that STAT1

429

deficiency did not affect the response of EGF and other cytokines such as IL10.

430

However, STAT1-deficient mice are more susceptible to pulmonary mycobacterial

431

infection41. Similarly, we observed the possibility of interaction with the extracellular

432

signal-regulated kinase 1/2 protein (ERK), in the zebrafish pathway, that plays a role in

433

signaling cascades and produces extracellular signals to intracellular targets42.

434

The response to SARS-CoV-2 in humans appears to be hemophagocytic

435

lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), characterized by immune hyperactivation that occurs when

436

Natural Killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes do not eliminate activated

437

macrophages, leading to excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines43. These

438

pro-inflammatory cytokines could be associated with a major pathomechanism in

439

kidney damage causing nephrotic proteinuria, collapsing glomerulopathy, membranous

440

glomerulopathy, nephritis, and acute tubular injury44. Although some data suggest the

441

incidence of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) by SARS-CoV-2 to be low45,46, other studies

442

indicate that AKI is one of the significantly more common complications in patients

443

who died of COVID-19, pointed out as a marker of multiple organ dysfunction and

444

severe disease46–48.

445

Although we did not measure this cytokine storm, we were able to observe

446

significant renal alterations in the injected animals. In addition, we observed an increase

447

of lymphocyte levels and an increase in melanin and mipofuscin in the kidneys that

448

could be associated with an intense activation of the immune system cells due to the

449

rSpike immunizations response, associated with the accumulation of immune

450

complexes49. These results suggest that the immunized fish produced immune

451

complexes.

452

Histological alterations were analyzed in the liver as mild lobular infiltration by

453

small lymphocytes, centrilobular sinusoidal dilation, patchy necrosis, moderate

454

microvesicular steatosis, mild inflammatory infiltrates in the hepatic lobule, and the

455

portal tract. These changes are similar to those observed in patients with COVID-1931,48.

456

Although the zebrafish biochemical liver function was not tested, a three-fold increase

457

in ALT, AST, and GGT levels has been reported during hospitalization48. These

458

alterations could be due to the direct cytopathic effect of the virus and could be

459

associated with higher mortality50.

460

With respect to the reproductive tissue, female zebrafish injected with rSpike

461

displayed severe damage in the ovary (follicular atresia, cellular infiltration, and

462

disorganized extracellular matrix) after 7 days of protein inoculation. On the other hand,

463

it is remarkable that ovarian damage was reversed after 14 days, when zebrafish

464

received a second injection of rSpike. In humans, there is evidence that ACE2 mRNA is

465

expressed, at low levels, during all stages of follicle maturation in the ovary51, and also

466

in the endometrium52. This pattern of ACE2 expression, in line with our observations,

467

could suggest that SARS-CoV-2 affects female fertility in humans and zebrafish. More

468

studies will be necessary to comprehend the molecular mechanisms underlying SARS-

469

CoV-2-induced female infertility and the effects in the ovarian function. To date,

470

damage in the female reproductive system of COVID-19 patients has not been reported

471

yet53.

472

In the sequence of these experimental findings, the in silico analysis showed

473

that zebrafish Ace2 receptor has the same potential for protein-ligand interaction as in

474

humans (Figure 6). We show in silico and in vivo that the zebrafish Ace2 receptor is

475

susceptible to the rSpike and interacts similarly to the human ACE2 receptor. The

476

importance of ACE2 receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and its role in vaccine studies

477

is shown in research with transgenic mice (HFH4-hACE2 in C3B6 mice)54. The use of

478

ACE2 receptor by SARS-CoV-2 in the attachment and infection of the host cells has

479

been well postulated in mammals, except for murines, and some birds, such as

480

pigeons55. The ACE-2 orthologue studies in non-mammalian animals, including

481

zebrafish, suggest the potential to unveil the role of this enzyme and its use for

482

therapeutic purposes56.

483

The receptors associated with the zebrafish humoral and cellular immune

484

response showed structural and functional homology with the human MHC II, MHCI,

485

TCR alpha and beta receptors. Similar results were observed by Bhattacharya and

486

collaborators, who analyzed by docking interaction of 13 peptides with the human MHC

487

I and II receptors and observed the antigenic capacity of these peptides57. Our findings

488

provided functional similarity of the same receptors in zebrafish, showing the

489

immunogenic capacity of the alpha and beta TCR receptors, and the functional

490

similarity with the human receptor. The in silico data can recognize, process, and

491

present antigens associated with rSpike protein that might be validated in in vivo studies

492

in future (Figure 1 a-d). As in mammals, the zebrafish has a conservative adaptive

493

immune system composed of T and B lymphocytes that develop from the thymus and

494

kidneys, respectively. The conservation of the immune system through evolution

495

reveals the importance of fish immunology studies to improve our knowledge of

496

mammalian immunity58,59.

497

The zebrafish enzymatic system is involved in the genetic rearrangement process

498

in which B (BCR) and T lymphocyte receptors (TCR) originate. They also have, like

499

humans, recombinant activating genes that control the gene segments V, D, and J,

500

producing a diversity of antibodies and lymphocyte receptors60. Despite this, teleosts

501

produce only three classes of antibodies: IgM61, IgW62, and IgZ, the latter exclusive to

502

zebrafish63. Studies in zebrafish showed that in the regions of the BCR receptor were

503

targets of mutations5. Although the affinity of antibodies in ectothermic vertebrates is

504

less efficient than in mammals, the deaminase activation and affinity maturation might

505

contribute to the diversification of antibodies in zebrafish64,65.

506

The world is now experiencing a global campaign to propose and test

507

therapeutics and vaccines. It is imperative to identify animal models for COVID-19 that

508

provide a translational approach for possible successful interventions. From February to

509

October 2020, the findings with animal models for COVID-19 included several

510

candidates, such as mice, Syrian hamsters, ferrets, non-human primates, minks, cats,

511

dogs, pigs, chicken, ducks, and fruit bats66. However, no references regarding zebrafish

512

models were found.

513

Finally, the conserved genetic homology between zebrafish and humans4 might

514

be one of the reasons for the intense inflammatory reaction from the immune system of

515

zebrafish to rSpike analyzed in this work. It has provoked damage to organs in a similar

516

pattern as happen in severe cases of COVID-19 in humans. The fish produced innate

517

and acquired immunity that is suitable for future studies to gather valuable information

518

about vaccine responses and therapeutic approaches. Altogether, we present the

519

zebrafish as an animal model for translational COVID-19 research.

600

containing only the dilution buffer. Another control group was challenged by a lysate of

601

bacterial fragment of E. coli BL21(DE3) extract. rSpike was injected into two

602

immunization sections in 20 zebrafish females (previously anesthetized with tricaine

603

methanesulfonate (Sigma) - at a dose of 150 mg/L) at an interval of 7 days, with the aim

604

of producing plasma antibodies. Passive antibody transfer to zebrafish eggs occurs

605

naturally as described by Wang and collaborators20. After immunization, females were

606

stimulated to mate (at 7 and 14 days after injection) and generated eggs. The time at

technique. Another control group was performed using 1 μg of a mix of proteins in

609

buffer 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 200mM NaCl, and 1mM EDTA: equivalent amount of

Antibody responses in zebrafish

616

Using SDS-PAGE protein electrophoresis, protein from fertilized eggs (10

617

μg/mL) and serum (10 μg/mL) from adult fish content (after 0, 7 and 14 days) were

618

assessed using methods described by Laemmli68. The gels were subsequently stained

619

with 0.25% Coomassie brilliant blue R (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).

620

Molecular weight and protein fraction levels were determined using readings from a

621

computerized densitometer in R software. To identify the protein content, different

622

markers for molecular weights were used and these ranged from 20 to 200 kDa. Protein

623

bands were excised from the SDS-polyacrylamide, and in-gel trypsin digestion was

624

performed according to Shevchenko et al.69 and the identification by mass spectrometry.

625

Proteins were precipitated from plasma samples with 4 volumes of cold acetone and 1

626

volume of cold methanol. The in-solution trypsin digestion was performed according to

627

Lopes Ferreira and collaborators70. Mass spectrometric analysis was done by LC–

628

MS/MS.

Histology from multiple organs

631

Fixation and decalcification of the adult zebrafish for histology and

632

immunofluorescence was performed according to Moore et al.71. For histopathological

633

analysis, 5-μm-thickness sections were mounted on slides and dewaxed in an oven at

634

60ºC and hydrated in decreasing solutions of xylol three times, and once in xylol +

635

alcohol, for 10 minutes each, followed by a 100, 90, 80, and 70% alcohol battery and

636

washed with distilled water for five minutes. They were then stained with hematoxylin

637

and eosin for observation of the general cellular structures.

Immunofluorescence assay and image acquisition

640

For the immunofluorescence assays, the tissues from zebrafish were obtained 0,

641

7, and 14 days after intraperitoneal injection of SARS-CoV-2 viral protein. Zebrafish

642

tissue sections (5 μm) mounted onto electrically charged slides to increase adherence

643

were deparaffinized in xylol. The samples underwent three 10-minute baths in xylol

644

(P.A.) and a final bath in ethanol/xylol solution (1:1) for 2 minutes. After being

645

deparaffinized, the samples were subjected to hydration by a sequence of ethanol baths

646

at decreasing concentrations (100%, 95%, 90%, 80%, 70%) for 2 minutes in each one,

647

followed by three washes in distilled water. Once hydrated, antigen retrieval was

648

performed by using a trypsin/phosphate-buffered solution (pH 7.2-7.3) mixture (1:1) at

649

37ºC for 30 minutes in a laboratory drying oven (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Next, the

650

blockade of unspecific epitopes was achieved by a 60-minute incubation in a solution

651

comprised of 2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma Aldrich) (w/v), 0.3% Triton 100X

652

(v/v), and phosphate-buffered solution (pH 7.2-7.3). After that, the primary antibodies

653

were diluted in the aforementioned solution as follows: anti-Ly6G (1:300, Invitrogen,

654

Clone RB6-8C5, Cat 14-5931-81, host: rabbit), anti-AIF-1/Iba1 (1:300, Novus

655

Biologicals, Cat NB100-1028, host: goat) or (1:300, Abcam, Cat ab5076, host: goat),

656

anti-CD4/FITC-conjugated (1:200, eBioscience, Clone RM4-5, Cat 11-0042-85), and

657

anti-CD8/APC.Cy7-conjugated (1:200, BD Bioscience, Clone 53-6.7, Cat 557654). The

658

samples were incubated in these primary antibodies overnight at 4ºC. Then, the samples

659

were washed three times in phosphate-buffered solution (pH 7.2-7.3) for 5 minutes

660

each. Secondary antibodies for anti-Ly6G and anti-Iba1 primary antibodies were

661

diluted as described above, as follows: anti-rabbit/Alexa488 (1:600, Invitrogen, Cat

662

A21206, host: donkey) and anti-goat/Alexa594 (1:600, Invitrogen, Cat A11058, host:

663

donkey). Incubation in these antibodies lasted 2 hours at room temperature. After

664

incubation, the samples were washed three times in phosphate-buffered solution (pH

665

7.2-7.3) for 10 minutes each. After the final wash, the samples were mounted with a

666

fluoromount containing DAPI dye (VectaShield). Finally, the slides were analyzed

667

under an Olympus VS120 microscope under 20x magnification to acquire images of the

668

whole zebrafish organism before focal analyses of the profile of the immune cells were

669

performed in specific zebrafish structures, which in turn was done by using an Axio

Annotation of ontological

675

The zebrafish and human proteins related to the subcellular location (cytoplasm,

676

membrane, and nucleus) were recovered according to the annotation of ontological

677

terms in the ENSEMBL database (https://www.ensembl.org/index.html, accessed

678

06/04/2020). For each subcellular location, protein-protein interactions were predicted

679

with a SARS-CoV-2 Spike N-terminal fragment, residues 16-165, (rSpike) using the

680

UNISPPI predictor, where only interactions with a score greater than 0.95 were

681

accepted as interactions72. The interacted proteins were submitted to functional

682

enrichment to identify biological pathways using the G:Profiler software73, based on the

683

database of zebrafish and human. In addition, the proteins were analyzed with the

684

Bioconductor Pathview package74 in the R environment in search of the biological

685

pathways. The pathways were obtained from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and

686

Genomes (KEGG) database75 and the model organism selected was the zebrafish and

687

human.

Network analysis

690

Samples were analyzed in triplicate, and their molecular masses and isoelectric

691

points of the proteins identified by MS / MS were observed using the ProtParam tool

692

(http://us.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html). Data normalization was performed, and a

693

significance cutoff was applied for the identified proteins at log-fold change ± 1.0.

694

Subsequently, the identified proteins on the UniprotKB database were blasted against

695

zebrafish All data obtained were mapped using STRING web tool v11.0 (https://string-

696

699

For in silico analysis, all FASTA sequences of proteins from zebrafish and

700

human, and SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded from the UNIPROT database

701

(http://www.uniprot.org). We then evaluated the subcellular localization of the

702

identified proteins using the CELLO (subcellular localization predictor) platform v.2.5

703

(http://cello.life.nctu.edu.tw/) and visualized the proteoform in the cleavage proteins in

704

Protter v. 1.0 (http://wlab.ethz.ch/protter/start/). In addition, the percentage of similarity

705

between the orthologous proteins of different species was calculated using the

706

EMBOSS Water platform (https://www.ebi.ac.uk), and protein alignments were

707

performed

708

709

PDB files (containing the 3D coordinates of the proteins) using the Raptor X tool

710

(http://raptorx.uchicago.edu). Then, structural similarities were compared on the iPDA

711

platform (http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr), and structural images of proteins were done

712

using the PyMOL software (https://pymol.org/2/). For the study of protein-protein
