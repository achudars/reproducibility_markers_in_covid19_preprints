Abstract:
While interferon restricts SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture, only a handful of Interferon
Stimulated Genes with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 have been identified. Here, we describe
a functional CRISPR/Cas9 screen aiming at identifying SARS-CoV-2 restriction factors. We identified
DAXX, a scaffold protein residing in PML nuclear bodies known to limit the replication of DNA viruses
and retroviruses, as a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells. Basal expression of
DAXX was sufficient to limit the replication of the virus, and DAXX over-expression further restricted
infection. In contrast with most of its previously described antiviral activities, DAXX-mediated
restriction of SARS-CoV-2 was independent of the SUMOylation pathway. SARS-CoV-2 infection
triggered the re-localization of DAXX to cytoplasmic sites of viral replication and led to its degradation.
Together, these results demonstrate that DAXX is a potent restriction factor for SARS-CoV-2 and that
the virus has evolved a mechanism to counteract its action.
Introduction. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative
agent of COVID-19 and the third coronavirus to cause severe disease in humans after the emergence
of SARS-CoV in 2002 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-related Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in
2012. Since the beginning of the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 140 million people
and claimed 3 million lives. While the majority of infected individuals experience mild (or no)
symptoms, severe forms of COVID-19 are associated with respiratory failure, shock and pneumonia.
Innate immune responses play a key role in COVID-19 pathogenesis: immune exhaustion (1) and
reduced levels of type-I and type-III interferon (IFN) have been observed in the plasma of severe
COVID-19 patients (2,3). Imbalanced immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, with a low and delayed IFN
response coupled to early and elevated levels of inflammation, have been proposed to be a major
driver of COVID-19 (4,5). Neutralizing auto-antibodies against type-I IFN (6) and genetic alterations in
several IFN pathway genes (7) have also been detected in critically ill COVID-19 patients. These
studies highlight the crucial need to characterize the molecular mechanisms by which IFN pathway
effectors may succeed, or fail, to control SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has been described to antagonize the IFN pathway by different
mechanisms involving the viral proteins ORF3b, ORF9b ORF6, and nsp15 (8), detection of SARSCoV-2 by the innate immune sensor Mda5 (9,10) leads to the synthesis of IFN and expression of IFN
Stimulated Genes (ISGs) in human airway epithelial cells (4). IFN strongly inhibits SARS-CoV-2
replication when added in cell culture prior to infection (11,12) or when administered intranasally in
hamsters (13), suggesting that some ISGs might have antiviral activity (14). However, relatively few
ISGs with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 have been identified so far. For instance, spikemediated viral entry and fusion is restricted by LY6E (15,16) and IFITMs (17,18). Mucins have also
been suggested in a recent pre-print to restrict viral entry (19). ZAP, which targets CpG dinucleotides
in RNA viruses, also restricts SARS-CoV-2, albeit moderately (20). A recent overexpression screen
identified 65 ISGs as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 (21), and found that BST-2/Tetherin is able to
restrict viral budding, although this activity is counteracted by the viral protein ORF7a. The RNA
helicase DDX42 was also shown to restrict several RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (22). We
hypothesize that additional ISGs with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 remain to be discovered.
Other antiviral factors that are not induced by IFN may also inhibit SARS-CoV-2. While several wholegenome CRISPR/Cas9 screens identified host factors required for SARS-CoV-2 replication (23–28),
none focused on antiviral genes.
Here, we performed a CRISPR/Cas9 screen designed to identify restriction factors for SARSCoV-2, assessing the ability of 1905 ISGs to modulate SARS-CoV-2 replication in human epithelial
lung cells. We report that the Death domain-associated protein 6 (DAXX), a scaffold protein residing in
PML nuclear bodies (29) and restricting DNA viruses (30) and retroviruses (31,32), is a potent inhibitor
of SARS-CoV-2 replication. SARS-CoV-2 restriction by DAXX is largely independent of the action of
IFN, and unlike most of its other known activities, of the SUMOylation pathway. Within hours of
infection, DAXX re-localizes to sites of viral replication in the cytoplasm, likely targeting viral

suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 developed a mechanism to counteract DAXX restriction.
Results.
A restriction factor-focused CRISPR/Cas9 screen identifies genes potentially involved in
SARS-CoV-2 inhibition. To identify restriction factors limiting SARS-CoV-2 replication, we generated
a pool of A549-ACE2 cells knocked-out (KO) for 1905 potential ISGs, using the sgRNA library we
previously developed to screen HIV-1 restriction factors (33). This library includes more ISGs than
most published libraries, as the inclusion criteria was less stringent (fold-change in gene expression in
THP1 cells, primary CD4+ T cells or PBMCs ³ 2). Transduced cells were selected by puromycin
treatment, treated with IFNa and infected with SARS-CoV-2. Infected cells were immuno-labelled with
a spike (S)-specific antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry. As expected (11,12), IFNa inhibited
infection by 7-fold (Fig. S1). Infected cells were sorted based on S expression (Fig. 1a), and DNA was
extracted from infected and non-infected control cells. Integrated sgRNA sequences in each cell
fraction were amplified by PCR and sequenced by NGS. Statistical analyses using the MAGeCK
package (34) led to the identification of sgRNAs significantly enriched or depleted in infected cells
representing antiviral and proviral factors, respectively (Fig. 1b). Although our screen was not
designed to explicitly study proviral factors, we did successfully identify the well-described SARS-CoV2 co-factor cathepsin L (CTSL) (35), validating our approach. USP18, a negative regulator of the IFN
signaling pathway (36), and ISG15, which favors Hepatitis C Virus replication (37), were also identified
as proviral ISGs. In contrast, core IFN pathway genes such as the IFN receptor (IFNAR1), STAT1,
and STAT2, were detected as antiviral factors, further validating our screening strategy. LY6E, a
previously described inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 entry (15,16), was also a significant hit. Moreover, our
screen identified APOL6, IFI6, DAXX and HERC5, genes that are known to encode proteins with
antiviral activity against other viruses (38–41), but had not previously been identified in the context of
SARS-CoV-2 infection. For all these genes except APOL6, individual sgRNAs were consistently
enriched (for antiviral factors) or depleted (for proviral factors) in the sorted population of infected cells,
while non-targeting sgRNAs were not (Fig. 1c).
LY6E and DAXX display antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. To validate the ability of the
identified hits to modulate SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells, we generated pools of A549-ACE2
knocked-out (KO) cells for different genes of interest by electroporating a mix of 3 sgRNA/Cas9
ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes per gene target. Levels of gene editing were above 80% in all of
the A549-ACE2 KO cell lines, as assessed by sequencing of the edited loci (Table 1). As controls, we
used cells KO for IFNAR1, for the proviral factor CTSL or for the antiviral factor LY6E, as well as cells
electroporated with non-targeting (NTC) sgRNAs/Cas9 RNPs. These different cell lines were then
treated with IFNa and infected with SARS-CoV-2. Viral replication was assessed by measuring the
levels of viral RNA in the supernatant of infected cells using RT-qPCR (Fig. 2a). In parallel, we titrated
the levels of infectious viral particles released into the supernatant of infected cells (Fig. 2b). As
expected, infection was significantly reduced in CTSL KO cells, confirming the proviral effect of this
gene (35). Among the selected antiviral candidate genes, only 2 had a significant impact on SARSCoV-2 replication: LY6E, and to an even greater degree, DAXX. Both genes restricted replication in
absence of IFNa, an effect which was detectable at the level of viral RNA (8-fold and 42-fold reduction
of infection, respectively, Fig. 2a) and of infectious virus (15-fold and 62-fold reduction, Fig. 2b).
Based on available single-cell RNAseq datasets (42), DAXX is expected to be expressed in cell types
relevant for SARS-CoV-2 such as lung epithelial cells, macrophages and T cells (Fig. S3).
In IFNa-treated cells. DAXX and LY6E KO led to a modest, but significant rescue of viral
replication, which was particularly visible when measuring the levels of infectious virus by plaque
assay titration (Fig. 2b), while the antiviral effect of IFNa treatment was completely abrogated in
IFNAR1 KO cells, as expected (Fig. 2c). However, IFNa still had a strong antiviral effect on SARSCoV-2 replication in both DAXX KO and LY6E KO cells (Fig. 2c). While DAXX and LY6E contribute to

the IFN-mediated restriction, this suggests that there are likely other ISGs contributing to this effect.
Although DAXX is sometimes referred to as an ISG, its expression is only weakly induced by IFN in
some human cell types (31,43). Consistent with this, we found little to no increase in DAXX expression
in IFNa-treated A549-ACE2 cells (Fig. S2). In addition, we tested the antiviral effect of DAXX on
several SARS-CoV-2 variants that have been suggested in a recent report to be partially resistant to
the antiviral effect of IFN (44). In these experiments, the 20I/501Y.V1 (UK), together with the
20J/501Y.V3 (Brazil) variant, were indeed less sensitive to IFN. DAXX, however, restricted all variants
to a similar level than the historical strain of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2d). This suggest that while some
variants may have evolved towards IFN-resistance, they are still efficiently restricted by DAXX.
To further validate the antiviral activity of DAXX against SARS-CoV-2, we quantified the levels
of several viral transcripts in WT and DAXX KO cells (Fig. 2e). The levels of all the transcripts tested
strongly increased in DAXX KO cells (20 to 30-fold across all experiments). This further confirmed that
DAXX strongly interferes with SARS-CoV-2 replication and suggests that it may target viral
transcription, or an earlier step of the viral life cycle.
DAXX restriction is SUMO-independent. DAXX is a small scaffold protein that acts by recruiting
other SUMOylated proteins in nuclear bodies through its C-terminal SUMO-Interacting Motif (SIM)
domain (45). The recruitment of these factors is required for the effect of DAXX on various cellular
processes such as transcription and apoptosis, and on its antiviral activities (31,46–48). DAXX can
also be SUMOylated itself (49), which may be important for some of its functions. To investigate the
role of SUMOylation in DAXX-mediated SARS-CoV-2 restriction, we used overexpression assays to
compare the antiviral activity of DAXX WT with two previously described DAXX mutants (50). First, we
used a version of DAXX in which 15 lysine residues have been mutated to arginine (DAXX 15KR),
which is unable to be SUMOylated; and second, a truncated version of DAXX that is missing its Cterminal SIM domain (DAXXDSIM) (47) and is unable to interact with its SUMOylated partners. A549ACE2 were refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection upon transfection with any plasmid, precluding us from
using this cell line. Instead, we transfected 293T-ACE2 cells, another SARS-CoV-2 permissive cell line
(18). Western blot (Fig. S4a) and flow cytometry (Fig. S4b) analyses showed that DAXX WT and
mutants were expressed to similar levels, with a transfection efficiency of 40 to 50% for all three
constructs.
We examined the effect of DAXX WT overexpression on the replication of SARS-CoV-2mNeonGreen (51) by microscopy. DAXX overexpression starkly reduced the number of infected cells
(Fig. 3a), revealing that DAXX-mediated restriction is not specific to A549-ACE2 cells. Using double
staining for HA-tagged DAXX and SARS-CoV-2, we found that most of the DAXX-transfected cells
were negative for infection, and conversely, that most of the infected cells did not express transfected
DAXX (Fig. 3a), indicating that DAXX imposes a major block to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In order to quantify the antiviral effect of overexpressed DAXX WT and mutants, we assessed
the number of cells positive for the S protein (among transfected cells) by flow cytometry (Fig. 3c-d)
and the abundance of viral transcripts by qRT-PCR (Fig. S4c). DAXX WT, 15KR and ∆SIM all
efficiently restricted SARS-CoV-2 replication. Indeed, at 24 hours p.i., the proportion of infected cells
(among HA-positive cells) was reduced by 2 to 3-fold as compared to control transfected cells for all 3
constructs (Fig. 3c). This effect was less pronounced but still significant at 48 hours p.i. (Fig. 3d).
Moreover, DAXX overexpression led to a significant reduction of the levels of two different viral
transcripts (Fig. S4c), in line with our earlier results showing that DAXX targets viral transcription (Fig.
2e). Together, these results show that DAXX overexpression restricts SARS-CoV-2 transcription in a
SUMOylation-independent mechanism.
SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers DAXX re-localization and degradation. DAXX mostly localizes in
nuclear bodies (29), whereas SARS-CoV-2 replication occurs in the cytoplasm. We reasoned that
DAXX localization may be altered during the course of infection in order for the restriction factor to
exert its antiviral effect. To test this hypothesis, we infected 293T-ACE2 cells with SARS-CoV-2 and
used high-resolution confocal microscopy to study the localization of endogenous DAXX (Fig. 4). As
expected (29), DAXX mostly localizes in the nuclei of non-infected cells, forming discrete foci. 6h after

SARS-CoV-2 infection, DAXX begins to re-localize to the cytoplasm, although nuclear foci can still be
detected. At 24h post-infection, however, DAXX is completely depleted from nuclear bodies, and is
found almost exclusively in the cytoplasm of infected cells, in close association with SARS-CoV-2
dsRNA. Western blot analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a marked decrease of total
DAXX expression in infected cells (Fig. 5a). This effect is visible at MOI 0.1, and almost complete
DAXX degradation can be observed at MOI 1. These results suggest that DAXX may be actively
targeted by SARS-CoV-2 for degradation during the course of infection. SARS-CoV-2 papain-like
protease (PLpro) is a possible candidate for this function, as it cleaves ISG15 from Mda5 (52) and
IRF3 (53). It was also shown that foot-and-mouth disease virus (FDMV) PLpro degrades DAXX (54).
We treated cells with GRL-0617, an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (53). Strikingly, GRL-0617
treatment partially restores DAXX expression (Fig. 5a) and subcellular localization to nuclear bodies in
infected cells at 24h p.i. at MOI 0.1 (Fig. 5b). Although we cannot exclude that GRL-0617 treatment
may have an indirect effect on DAXX levels by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication itself, this is unlikely
to be a major mitigating effect at 24h post-infection, particularly since imaging analysis reveals a
restoration of DAXX specifically in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (Fig. 5b). Further work will be required
to uncover whether PLPro or a proteolytic product of the viral polyprotein chain degrades DAXX.
Discussion.
Comparison with other screens. The whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 screens conducted to date on
SARS-CoV-2 infected cells mostly identified host factors necessary for viral replication (23–28) and
did not focus on antiviral genes, as did our screen. Two overexpression screens, however, identified
ISGs with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (16,21). In the first one, Pfaender et al. screened 386
ISGs for their antiviral activity against the endemic human coronavirus 229E, and identified LY6E as a
restriction factor inhibiting both 229E and SARS-CoV-2. Our screen also identified LY6E as a top hit
(Fig.1), further validating the findings of both studies. Four additional genes had significant p-values in
both Pfaender et al. and our work: IFI6, HERC5, OAS2 and SPSB1 (Table S5-S6). We showed that
knocking-out LY6E and DAXX only partially rescued SARS-CoV-2 replication in IFN-treated cells (Fig.
2), suggesting that they contribute modestly to IFN-mediated restriction and that other IFN effectors
active against SARS-CoV-2 remain to be identified. For instance, other ISGs, such as IFITMs, inhibit
SARS-CoV-2 viral entry (17–19). In the second screen, Martin Sancho et al. tested 399 ISGs against
SARS-CoV-2. Among the 65 antiviral ISGs identified, they focused on BST-2/Tetherin, that targets
viral budding. BST-2/Tetherin was not a significant hit in our screen (Table S5-6). This discrepancy
can be easily explained by the fact that our screen relies on the sorting of S-positive cells, and is
therefore unable to detect late-acting antiviral factors. Of note, DAXX was absent from the ISG
libraries used by both overexpression screens, which explains why it was not previously identified as
an antiviral ISG for SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, our sgRNA library, by including 1905 genes, targeted a
wider set of ISGs and “ISG-like” genes, including genes like DAXX that are not (or only weakly)
induced by IFN in some cell types (31,43). Interestingly, IFN has a stronger effect on DAXX
expression levels in other mammals, including in some bat species (55). Future studies may
investigate whether DAXX orthologs of different species are also able to restrict SARS-CoV-2 and
whether DAXX participates in IFN-mediated viral restriction in these hosts.
DAXX is a restriction factor for SARS-CoV-2. Our CRISPR/Cas9 screen identifies DAXX as a
potent antiviral factor restricting the replication of SARS-CoV-2, acting independently of IFN and likely
targeting an early step of the viral life cycle such as transcription. DAXX fulfills all of the criteria
defining a bona fide SARS-CoV-2 restriction factor: knocking-out endogenous DAXX leads to an
enhanced viral replication (Fig. 2), while over-expression of DAXX restricts infection (Fig. 3). DAXX
co-localizes with viral dsRNA (Fig. 4) and SARS-CoV-2 antagonizes DAXX to some degree, as
evidenced by the degradation of DAXX induced by viral replication (Fig. 5). Although DAXX
expression is not upregulated by IFN (Fig. S2), basal levels of expression are sufficient for its antiviral
activity, as has been shown for other potent restriction factors. Single-cell RNAseq analyses (Fig. S3)

indicated that DAXX is expressed in cell types targeted by the virus in patients, such as lung epithelial
cells and macrophages.
Mechanism of DAXX-mediated restriction. DAXX is mostly known for its antiviral activity against
DNA viruses replicating in the nucleus, such as adenovirus 5 (AdV5) (56) and human papillomavirus
(HPV) (57). Most of these viruses antagonize PML and/or DAXX, which interacts with PML in nuclear
bodies (29). We show here that DAXX is also able to restrict a positive sense RNA virus that replicates
in the cytoplasm, which may represent a first step into establishing DAXX as a broad-spectrum
restriction factor. Recent studies have shown that DAXX inhibits the reverse transcription of HIV-1 in
the cytoplasm (31,32). Within hours of infection, DAXX subcellular localization was altered, with DAXX
accumulating in the cytoplasm and colocalizing with incoming HIV-1 capsids (32). Here, we observed
a similar phenomenon, with a rapid re-localization of DAXX from the nucleus to viral replication sites
(Fig. 4), where it likely exerts its antiviral effect. Early events in the replication cycle of both HIV-1 and
SARS-CoV-2, such as viral fusion or virus-induced stress, may thus trigger DAXX re-localization to the
cytoplasm. DAXX seems to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, however, by a distinct mechanism: whereas the
recruitment of SUMOylated partners through the SIM-domain is required for the effect of DAXX on
HIV-1 reverse transcription (31), it was not the case in the context of SARS-CoV-2 restriction. This
result was surprising, since DAXX has no enzymatic activity and rather acts as a scaffold protein
recruiting SUMOylated partners through its SIM domain (50). Some DAXX functions, such as
interaction with the chromatin remodeler ATRX (29), are however SIM-independent. Future work
should determine which DAXX domains and residues are required for its antiviral activity.
Antagonism of DAXX by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 replication triggers DAXX degradation (Fig. 5),
which likely represents an efficient antagonism strategy. Other viruses are also able to degrade DAXX:
for instance, the AdV5 viral protein E1B-55K targets DAXX for proteasomal degradation (56), and
FDMV PLpro directly degrades DAXX (54). We speculate that the SARS-CoV-2 proteases PLpro or
3C-like proteinase might be involved. Treatment of cells with GRL-0617, an inhibitor of PLpro, partially
prevented virus-induced DAXX degradation and restored DAXX localization to the nucleus. However,
this effect could be indirect, since GRL-0617 also blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication by preventing
polyprotein cleavage. Future work will be necessary to formally demonstrate the direct degradation of
DAXX by PLpro and to determine whether other viral strategies promote evasion from DAXX
restriction.

Generation of CRISPR/Cas9 library cells. HEK 293T cells were transfected with the sgRNA library plasmid
together with plasmids coding for Gag/Pol (R8.2) and for the VSVg envelope (pVSVg) using a ratio of 5:5:1 and
calcium phosphate transfection. Supernatants were harvested at 36h and 48h, concentrated 80-fold by
ultracentrifugation (22,000 g, 4°C for 1h) and pooled. To generate ISG KO library cells, 36x106 A549-ACE2 cells
were seeded in 6 well plates (106 cells per well) 24h before transduction. For each well, 100 µL of concentrated
lentivector was diluted in 500 µL of serum-free DMEM, supplemented with 10 µg/mL of DEAE dextran (Sigma
#D9885). After 48h, transduced cells were selected by puromycin treatment for 20 days (1 µg/mL; Sigma
#P8833).
CRISPR/Cas9 screen. 4x107 A549-ACE2 cells were treated with IFNa (200U/mL). 16h later, cells were infected
at a MOI of 1 in serum-free media complemented with TPCK-trypsin and IFNa (200 U/mL). After 90 min, the viral
inoculum was removed, and cells were maintained in DMEM containing 5% FBS and IFNa (200 U/mL). After
24h, cells were harvested and fixed for 15 min in Formalin 1%. Fixed cells were washed in cold FACS buffer
containing PBS, 2% Bovine Serum Albumin (Sigma-Aldrich #A2153-100G), 2 mM EDTA (Invitrogen #15575038) and 0.1% Saponin (Sigma-Aldrich #S7900-100G). Cells were incubated for 30 min at 4°C under rotation
with primary antibody diluted in FACS buffer. Incubation with the secondary antibody was performed during 30
min at 4°C under rotation. Stained cells were resuspended in cold sorting buffer containing PBS, 2% FBS, 25
mM Hepes (Sigma-Aldrich #H0887-100ML) and 5 mM EDTA. Infected cells were sorted on a BD FACS Aria
Fusion. Sorted and control (non-infected, not IFN-treated) cells were centrifugated (20 min, 2,000g) and
resuspended in lysis buffer (NaCI 300 mM, SDS 0.1%, EDTA 10 mM, EGTA 20 mM, Tris 10 mM) supplemented
with 1% Proteinase K (Qiagen #19133) and 1% RNAse A/T1 (ThermoFisher #EN0551) and incubated overnight
at 65°C. Two consecutive phenol-chloroform (Sigma #P3803-100ML) extractions were performed and DNA was
recovered by ethanol precipitation. Nested PCR was performed using the Herculase II Fusion DNA Polymerase
(Agilent, #600679) and the DNA oligos indicated in Table S1. PCR1 products were purified using QIAquick PCR
Purification kit (Qiagen #28104). PCR2 products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP Beads (Beckman
Coulter Life Sciences #A63880). DNA concentration was determined using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo
Fisher #Q32854) and adjusted to 2 nM prior to sequencing. NGS was performed using the NextSeq 500/550
High Output Kit v2.5 75 cycles (Illumina #20024906).
Screen analysis. Reads were demultiplexed using bcl2fastq Conversion Software v2.20 (Illumina) and
fastx_toolkit v0.0.13. Sequencing adapters were removed using cutadapt v1.9.1 (58). The reference library was
built using bowtie2 v2.2.9 (59). Read mapping was performed with bowtie2 allowing 1 seed mismatch in --local
mode and samtools v1.9 (60). Mapping analysis and gene selection were performed using MAGeCK v0.5.6,
normalizing the data with default parameters. sgRNA and gene enrichment analyses are available in Table S5S6, respectively and full MAGeCK output at https://github.com/Simon-LoriereLab/crispr_isg_sarscov2.
Generation of multi-guide gene knockout cells. 3 sgRNAs per gene were designed (Table S2). 10 pmol of
NLS-Sp.Cas9-NLS (SpCas9) nuclease (Aldevron #9212) was combined with 30 pmol total synthetic sgRNA (10
pmol for each sgRNA) (Synthego) to form RNPs in 20 µL total volume with SE Buffer (Lonza #V5SC-1002). The
reaction was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. 2x105 cells per condition were pelleted by centrifugation

at 100g for 3 min, resuspended in SE buffer and diluted to 2x104 cells/µL. 5 µL of cell solution was added to the
pre-formed RNP solution and gently mixed. Nucleofections were performed on a Lonza HT 384-well nucleofector
system (Lonza #AAU-1001) using program CM-120. Immediately following nucleofection, each reaction was
transferred to a 96-well plate containing 200 µL of DMEM 10% FBS (5x104 cells per well). Two days postnucleofection, DNA was extracted using DNA QuickExtract (Lucigen #QE09050). Cells were lysed in 50 µL of
QuickExtract solution and incubated at 68°C for 15 min followed by 95°C for 10 min. Amplicons were generated
by PCR amplification using NEBNext polymerase (NEB #M0541) or AmpliTaq Gold 360 polymerase
(ThermoFisher #4398881) and the primers indicated in Table S3. PCR products were cleaned-up and analyzed
by Sanger sequencing. Sanger data files and sgRNA target sequences were input into Inference of CRISPR
Edits (ICE) analysis https://ice.synthego.com/#/ to determine editing efficiency and to quantify generated indels
(61). Percentage of alleles edited is expressed as an ice-d score.
SARS-CoV-2 infection assays. A549-ACE2 cells were infected by incubating the virus for 1h with the cells
maintained in DMEM supplemented with 1 μg/ml TPCK-trypsin (Sigma #4370285). The viral input was then
removed and cells were kept in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS. For 293T-ACE2 cells, infections were
performed without TPCK-trypsin. All experiments involving infectious material were performed in Biosafety Level
3 facilities in compliance with Institut Pasteur’s guidelines and procedures.
Hit validation. 2.5x104 A549-ACE2 KO cells were seeded in 96-well plates 18h before the experiment. Cells
were treated with IFNa and infected as described above. At 72h post-infection, supernatants and cellular
monolayers were harvested in order to perform qRT-PCR and plaque assay titration. Infectious supernatants
were heat-inactivated at 80°C for 10 min. For intracellular RNA, cells were lysed in a mixture of Trizol Reagent
(Invitrogen #15596018) and PBS at a ratio of 3:1. Total RNA was extracted using the Direct-zol 96 RNA kit
(Zymo Research #R2056) or the Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research #R2050). qRT-PCR was
performed either directly on the inactivated supernatants or on extracted RNA using the Luna Universal OneStep RT-qPCR Kit (NEB #E3005E) in a QuantStudio 6 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) or in a StepOne Plus
thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). Primers used are described in Table S4. Cycling conditions were the
following: 10 min at 55°C, 1 min at 95°C and 40 cycles of 95°C for 10s and 60°C for 1 min. Results are
expressed as PFU equivalents/mL as the standard curve was performed by diluting RNA extracted from a viral
stock with a known titer. For plaque assay titration, VeroE6 cells were seeded in 24-well plates (105 cells per
well) and infected with serial dilutions of infectious supernatant diluted in DMEM during 1h at 37°C. After
infection, 0.1% agarose semi-solid overlays were added. At 72h post-infection, cells were fixed with Formalin 4%
(Sigma #HT501128-4L) and plaques were visualized using crystal violet coloration.
Overexpression assay. 2x105 293T-ACE2 cells were seeded in a 24-well plate 18h before experiment. Cells
were transfected with 500 ng of plasmids expressing HA-DAXX WT, HA-DAXX 15KR and HA-DAXXΔSIM
plasmids, using Fugene 6 (Promega # E2691), following the manufacturer’s instructions. HA-NRB1 was used as
negative control. After 24h cells were infected at the indicated MOI in DMEM 2% FBS. When indicated, cells
were treated with 10 mM of remdesivir (MedChemExpress #HY-104077) at the time of infection. For flow
cytometry analysis, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized in a PBS 1% BSA 0.025% saponin
solution for 30 min prior to staining with corresponding antibodies for 1h at 4°C diluted in the permeabilization
solution. Samples were acquired on a BD LSR Fortessa and analyzed using FlowJo. Total RNA was extracted
using a RNeasy Mini kit and submitted to DNase treatment (Qiagen). RNA concentration and purity were
evaluated by spectrophotometry (NanoDrop 2000c, ThermoFisher). In addition, 500 ng of RNA were reverse
transcribed with both oligo dT and random primers, using a PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Takara Bio) in a 10 mL
reaction. Real-time PCR reactions were performed in duplicate using Takyon ROX SYBR MasterMix blue dTTP
(Eurogentec) on an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 5 (ThermoFisher). Transcripts were quantified using the
following program: 3 min at 95°C followed by 35 cycles of 15s at 95°C, 20s at 60°C, and 20s at 72°C. Values for
each transcript were normalized to expression levels of RPL13A. The primers used are indicated in Table S4.
Western blot. Cell lysates were prepared using RIPA lysis and extraction buffer (ThermoFisher #89901). Protein
concentration was determined using Bradford quantification. Proteins were denaturated using 4X Bolt LDS
Sample Buffer (Invitrogen) and 10X Bolt Sample Reducing Agent (Invitrogen). 40 µg of proteins were separated
on Bolt 4-12% Bis-Tris Mini Protein Gels (Invitrogen) and transferred on membranes using the iBlot Transfer
Stack PVDF mini (Invitrogen) and an iBlot Dry Blotting System (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked with 5%
BSA in PBS (blocking buffer) and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. Membranes were
washed and incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. SuperSignal West Pico PLUS

Chemiluminescent Substrate (ThermoFisher #34579) was added on the membranes and pictures were taken on
a myECL Imager (ThermoFisher).
Microscopy Immunolabeling and Imaging. 293T-ACE2 cells were cultured and infected with SARS-CoV-2 as
described above. When indicated, cells were treated with 50 mg/mL of GRL-0617 (MedChemExpress #HY117043), a specific inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (53), at the time of infection.
Cultures were rinsed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (electronic microscopy grade; Alfa Aesar) in
PBS for 10 min at room temperature, treated with 50 mM NH4Cl for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X100 for 15 min, and blocked with 0.3% BSA for 10 min. Cells were incubated with primary and secondary
antibodies for 1h and 30 min, respectively, in a moist chamber. Nuclei were labeled with Hoechst dye (Molecular
Probes). Images were acquired using a LSM700 (Zeiss) confocal microscope equipped with a 63X objective or
by Airyscan LSM800 (Zeiss). Image analysis was performed using ImageJ.
Single-cell RNAseq analysis. Single cell RNAseq analysis were performed in the BioTuring Browser Software
(v2.8.42) developed by BioTuring, using a dataset made available by Liao et al. (42) (ID: GSE145926). All
processing steps were done by BioTuring Browser (62). Cells with less than 200 genes and mitochondrial genes
higher than 10% were excluded from the analysis.
Statistical analysis. GraphPad Prism was used for statistical analyses. Linear models were computed using
Rstudio.

Figures.

Figure 1: ISG-focused CRISPR/Cas9 screening approach to identify restriction factors for
SARS-CoV-2. a: CRISPR/Cas9 screen outline. A549-ACE2 cells were transduced with lentivectors
encoding the ISG CRISPR/Cas9 library and selected by puromycin treatment for 20 days. Library cells
were then pre-treated with 200 U/mL of IFNa for 16 hours, and infection with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 1.
24 hours post infection, infected cells were fixed with formalin treatment, permeabilized by saponin
treatment and stained with a monoclonal anti-spike antibody. After secondary staining, infected cells
were sorted and harvested. Non-infected, non-IFNa treated cells were harvested as a control. DNA
was extracted from both cellular fractions and sgRNA loci amplification was carried out by PCR.
Following NGS, bio-informatic analysis using the MAGeCK package was conducted. b: Screen
results. By taking into account the enrichment ratios of each of the 8 different sgRNAs for every gene,
the MAGeCK analysis provides a modified robust rank aggregation (α-RRA) score, with further onesided significance testing. A positive score is assigned to KOs enriched in infected cells (i.e. restriction
factor, represented in the top fraction of the graph) and a negative score is assigned to KOs depleted
in infected cells (i.e. proviral factors, represented in the bottom portion of the graph). Gene with an
FDR < 0.05 are represented in black. 3 genes with a FDR > 0.05, but with a p-value < 0.005 were
additionally selected and are represented in red. c: Individual sgRNA enrichment. For the indicated
genes, the enrichment ratio of the 8 sgRNAs present in the library was calculated as the MAGeCK
normalized read counts in infected cells divided by those in the original pool of cells and is
represented in log2 fold change. As a control, the enrichment ratios of the 200 non-targeting control
sgRNAs (NTCs) are also represented, merged together in one NTC for visualization purposes only.
Statistics: one-way ANOVA, ns = p-value > 0.05, * = p-value < 0.05, ** = p-value < 0.01, **** = p-value

Figure 2: DAXX is a restriction factor for SARS-CoV-2. A-C: Antiviral activity of ISGs against
SARS-CoV-2. A549-ACE2 knocked-out for the indicated genes were generated using a multi-guide
approach, leading to pools of KO cells with a high frequency of indels. KO cells were pre-treated with
0 (circles) or 200 (triangles) U/mL of IFNa 24h prior to triplicate infection with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI 0.1).
Supernatants were harvested at 72h post infection. The mean of three independent experiments, with
infections carried out in triplicate, is shown. a: For the titration of RNA levels, supernatants were heat
inactivated prior to quantification by qRT-PCR. Serial dilutions of a stock of known infectious titer was
used as a standard (PFU equivalents/mL). Statistics: 2-way ANOVA, * = p-value < 0.05, ** = p-value <
0.01, *** = p-value < 0.001, **** = p-value < 0.0001. b: For the titration of infectious virus levels by
plaque assay, supernatants were serially diluted and used to infect VeroE6 cells. Plaques formed after
3 days of infection were quantified using crystal violet coloration. Statistics: Dunnett’s test on a linear
model, * p-value < 0.05, ** p-value < 0.01, *** p-value < 0.001. c: For each of the indicated KO, the
data shown in A is represented as fold change in log10 titers (i.e. the triplicate log10 titers of the nontreated condition divided by the mean of the triplicate log10 titers IFNa-treated condition, n=3).
Statistics: 2-way ANOVA, ns = p-value > 0.05, **** = p-value < 0.001. d: A549-ACE2 WT or DAXX KO
cells were infected in triplicates at an MOI of 0.1 with the following SARS-CoV-2 strains:
BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020 (historical strain) ; hCoV-19/France/IDF-IPP11324/2020 (20I/501Y.V1,
sometimes referred to as United Kingdom or B.1.1.7) ; hCoV-19/France/PDL-IPP01065/2021

(20J/501Y.V3, sometimes referred to as Brazil or P.1). Supernatants were harvested at 72h post
infection. Supernatants were heat inactivated prior to quantification by qRT-PCR. Serial dilutions of a
stock of known infectious titer was used as a standard (PFU equivalents/mL). The mean of two
independent experiments, with infections carried out in triplicate, is shown. Statistics: 2-way ANOVA, *
= p-value < 0.05, *** = p-value < 0.001, **** = p-value < 0.0001. e: A549-ACE2 WT or DAXX KO were
infected in triplicates with SARS-CoV-2 at a MOI of 0.1. After 72h of infection, cell monolayers were
harvested and cellular RNAs were extracted. The levels of each of the indicated viral transcripts were
quantified by qRT-PCR and normalized to GAPDH levels. Fold change in DAXX KO cells compared to
the average of control cells is represented. 3 independent experiments are shown and taken into
account as fixed effects in a linear model. Statistics: Dunnett’s test on a linear model, * p-value < 0.05,
** p-value < 0.01, *** p-value < 0.001.

Figure 3: DAXX restriction of SARS-CoV-2 is SUMOylation independent. A-B: DAXX
overexpression restricts SARS-CoV-2. 293T-ACE2 cells were transfected with DAXX WT. 24h after
transfection, cells were infected with the mNeonGreen fluorescent reporter SARS-CoV-2 at the
indicated MOI. Cells were either visualized with an EVOS fluorescence microscope (a) or stained with
an HA-antibody detecting DAXX and imaged by confocal microscopy (b). Scale bars correspond to
200 µm (a) and 30 µm (b) c-d: DAXX mutants are still able to restrict SARS-CoV-2. 293T-ACE2
cells were transfected with HA-DAXX WT ; H-ADAXX 15KR ; HA-DAXX∆SIM ; or with HA-NRB1 as
negative control plasmid. 24h after transfection, cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of
0.1. When indicated, cells were treated with remdesivir at the time of infection. After 24 or 48h,
infected cells were double-stained recognizing dsRNA (to read out infection) and HA (to read out
transfection efficiency) and acquired by flow cytometry. The percentage of infected cells among HApositive (transfected) cells for one representative experiments is shown in c, for the mean of 3
independent experiments in d. Statistics: one-way ANOVA Holm corrected, ns = p-value > 0.05, * = pvalue < 0.05, ** = p-value < 0.01, *** = p-value < 0.001.
