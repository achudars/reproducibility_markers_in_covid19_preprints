Abstract
The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is the disease that has been identified as severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but the prophylactic treatment of SARS-CoV-2 is
still under investigation. The effective delivery of eukaryotic expression plasmids to the immune system's
inductive cells constitutes an essential requirement for the generation of effective DNA vaccines. Here,
we have explored the use of Salmonella typhimurium as vehicles to deliver expression plasmids orally.
Attenuated Salmonella phoP harboring eukaryotic expression plasmids that encoded spike protein of
SARS-CoV-2 was administered orally to Wistar rats. Rats were immunized orally with Salmonella that
carried a eukaryotic expression plasmid once a week for three consecutive weeks. The efficiency of the
vaccination procedure was due to the transfer of the expression plasmid from the bacterial carrier to the
mammalian host. Evidence for such an event could be obtained in vivo and in vitro. Our results showed
that all immunized animals generated humoral immunity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,
indicating that a Salmonella-based vaccine carrying the Spike gene can elicit SARS-CoV-2-specific
humoral immune responses in rats, and may be useful for the development of a protective vaccine against
SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction
Novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a life-threatening contagious disease caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 23 June 2020, data from the World
Health Organization (WHO) has shown that since the first SARS-CoV-2 case emerged in China's Wuhan
city, in November 2019, it has affected over 8,546,919 cases in over 200 countries and devitalized near
456,726lives. There is no specific and compelling medicine or vaccine that has developed against SARSCoV-2, currently treated with heteropathy or conservative therapeutics (El-Aziz and Stockand, 2020).
Although the first COVID-19 outbreak was controlled by quarantine in China, more and more case
reports in other countries indicated that COVID-19 remains a constant threat. Therefore, it is essential
to develop a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Efforts to create safe and effective SARSCoV-2 vaccines are underway worldwide (Prompetchara et al., 2020). Clinical trials utilizing virus
(inactivated or attenuated), viral vector (replicating or non-replicating), nucleic acid (DNA or RNA), and
protein-based (protein subunit or virus-like particles) developed across the world (Callaway, 2020; Corey
et al., 2020). An inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine seems to be the most facile and convenient option,
but inactivated vaccines are more expensive than oral vaccines, considering the scale of the vulnerable
population worldwide. Therefore, developing a gene-based vaccine may be a more promising choice (Liu
et al., 2005).
The SARS-CoV-2 genome (30 kb in size) encodes a large, non-structural polyprotein (ORF1a/b) that is
further proteolytically cleaved to generate 15/16 proteins, four structural proteins and five accessory
proteins (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7, ORF8, and ORF9) (Chan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020).
Those four structural proteins consist of the spike surface glycoprotein, the membrane protein, the
envelope protein, and the nucleocapsid protein, which is essential for SARS-CoV-2 assembly and
infection. The spike surface glycoprotein plays a crucial role in its attachment to host cells and can be
further cleaved by host proteases into an N-terminal S1 subunit and a membrane-bound C-terminal S2
region (Yuan et al., 2017). Binding of the S1 subunit to a host receptor (i.e., ACE2 receptor) can
destabilize the prefusion trimer, leading to shedding of the S1 subunit and transition of the S2 subunit
into a highly stable post-fusion conformation (Li et al., 2020). To engage a host receptor, the receptorbinding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit undergoes hinge-like conformational movements, which
transiently hide or expose the determinants of receptor binding (Li et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020).
DNA vaccination, i.e., immunization with an isolated eukaryotic expression plasmid that encodes the
antigen rather than immunization with the antigen itself, has added a new dimension to vaccine research
(Klinman et al., 2000). The tremendous flexibility offered by DNA vaccination includes the possibility
of co-expressing immunomodulatory molecules like cytokines, co-stimulatory molecules, or antisense
RNA to steer the immune response into the required direction. Besides, antigens can be manipulated by
the addition of sequences that target transport to particular cellular compartments or influence their
processing, thus improving the efficacy of immunization. Furthermore, DNA vaccines can be applied in
ways that favor either systemic or mucosal responses. Therefore, it is foreseeable that appropriate
expression plasmids for a wide variety of applications will be developed to allow a rapid testing of
potential protective vaccine candidates in suitable animal models and a quick assessment of optimal
strategy (Darji et al., 2000).

A significant drawback of genetic vaccination is its inefficiency, which is inherent in the way that
vaccines are currently delivered, and its requirement of relatively large amounts of purified plasmids (Lai
and Bennett, 1998). Thus, it is mandatory to develop a carrier system that improves efficacy and possibly
target the vaccines in vivo inductive sites and cells of the immune system. The use of bacteria as vehicles
for genetic vaccination is an attractive and straightforward idea derived from many intrinsic properties
afforded by these systems. Previous studies reported that viral expression of the full-length S protein or
S1 subunit of SARS coronavirus elicits a high titer of neutralizing antibodies in monkey and rat models
(Bukreyev et al., 2004; Gao et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2005). In this study, we used a eukaryotic expression
encoding S protein of SARS-CoV-2 by attenuated Salmonella carrier and investigated its ability to induce
specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Our study demonstrated that specific antibodies against SARSCoV-2 were elicited in a rat model following the oral administration of SARS-CoV-2-S. This result
indicates that our construct could be developed into a safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

Materials and Methods
Bacterial strains, growth conditions, and oligonucleotides.
Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) strains were derived from the wild-type
strain ATCC 14028s (14028). Salmonella was grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (Difco).
When necessary, antibiotics were added to bacterial cultures at ﬁnal concentrations of 50 µg/ml for
ampicillin (Ap), 20 µg/ml for chloramphenicol (Cm), or 50 µg/ml for kanamycin (Km). E. coli
DH5α was used as hosts for the preparation of plasmid DNA, respectively. Oligonucleotides used
in this study are given in Table 1. Salmonella phoP (STM1231) was incubated overnight at 37℃
with shaking at maximum 50 rpm until an OD600 of 0.6 was reached, then washed and resuspended
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 30% glycerol for oral administration.

Strain construction and transformation of Plasmid
into S. typhimurium phoP
Salmonella strain gene deletion was generated as described previously (Datsenko and Wanner,
2000). Deletions of the phoP gene were carried out using primer pairs P1H1 and P2H2, to amplify
the kanamycin resistance cassette (KmR) from plasmid pKD4 (Datsenko and Wanner, 2000), the
PCR products were electroporated into wild-type cells harboring pKD46, and KmR colonies were
selected. The integration of the drug-resistant cassette into the chromosome in these mutants was
confirmed by colony PCR. The KmR cassette was removed by using pCP20. Electroporation was
carried out by mixing 100 μL of resuspended cells with 0.2 μg plasmid DNA. The suspension was
transferred into a disposable cuvette (Bio-Rad Laboratory, Richmond, CA) with an 0.2 cm electrode
gap and subjected to an electric pulse at 8 ms, 1.5 kv, 600 Ω and 10 μF using a MicroPulser (BioRad Laboratory, Richmond, CA).

In vitro transfection of pSARS-CoV-2-S plasmid
The pcDNA3.1(+)-CMV-SARS-CoV-2-S-GFP (pSARS-CoV-2-S) plasmid was purchased from
Genscript Co., Ltd. (Nanjing, China) (Fig. 1). Plasmid and DNA isolation/purification kits were
purchased from TIANGEN Biotech Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Transfection reagent DoGOX was
described in our previvors study (Ganbold et al., 2017). 293T cells were propagated in Dulbecco’s
modiﬁed Eagle medium (DMEM) (HyClone, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Gibco, USA) and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2. For the in vitro
transfection experiment, pcDNA3.1(+)-GFP control and pcDNA3.1(+)-CMV-2019-nCoV-S-GFP
were used. Cells (1.5 × 105 cells/well) were seeded into 6-well plates the day before transfection.
Cells were transfected with 2 µg/well of DNA complexed to DoGox for 24 h, as previously
described (Xiao et al., 2016).

Detection of SARS-CoV-2-S protein expression in vitro.
For the western blot detection of SARS-CoV-2-S protein, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS
and harvested from the dishes with a cell scraper by adding a WIP lysis buffer. The recovered lysate was
incubated for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 20 min to remove cell debris. The protein
concentration of whole-cell lysates was determined by using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce). Protein
samples were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Amersham), then
proteins were monitored with ECL Western blotting substrate (Pierce) after incubation with anti-SARSCoV-2-S-RBD (Sino Biological, China) or anti-β-actin antibody (Solarbio, China).

DNA

immunization

delivered

by

attenuated S. typhimurium
A total of 18 female Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups, with nine rats each. The first
group was immunized orally with 1×10 7 attenuated S. typhimurium phoP transformed with pcDNA3.1GFP in 200 μl of PBS. The second group of rats was given 200 μL of PBS with
1×107 attenuated S. typhimurium PhoP transformed with pcDNA3.1(+)-CMV-SARS-CoV-2-S-GFP.
All mice were given 200 μL of 10% NaHCO3 orally to neutralize gastric acids before oral inoculation
with bacteria. All groups of the rat were boosted three times with the same vaccine components at two
weeks interval.

Enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA)
As previously described, the sera were used to test the anti-SARS-CoV-2-S IgG antibodies by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). (Vedi et al., 2008). Briefly, ELISA was performed in 96-well
plates (Costar, USA) coated with 0.5 µg of rSARS-CoV-2-S (KITGEN BIOTECHNOLOGY, China) per
well in 100µl bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6). After being blocked with 5% FCS, 100 µl serum samples at
several dilutions in PBS were added to the wells and incubated at 37°C for one hour. Then the HRP
conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG antibodies (1:3000, Solarbio, China) were added, and incubation
continued at 37°C for one hour. The plate was developed using TMB (Solarbio, China), following 2 M
H2SO4 addition to stopping the reaction, and read at 450 nm by ELISA plate reader for final data. Samples
were analyzed in duplicate.

Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed with one-way ANOVA using GraphPad Prism 6.0. All data were
expressed as the mean ±standard deviation.

Results
Construction of S. Typhimurium strains with phoP mutation
Given the ultimate objective of constructing a vaccine strain that would be safe in mammals, we
generated a ΔphoP strain by λ-Red recombination engineering using the one-step inactivation procedure
developed by Datsenko and Wanner using pKD4-amplified PCR products. λ-Red functions were
expressed from plasmid pKD46. Kanamycin cassettes were excised with the pCP20 plasmid as
previously described (Fig. 1A–B) (Datsenko and Wanner, 2000). Strains were verified by genomic DNA
PCR by using primers pair for the phoP gene with RT-phoP-F& RT-phoP-R or rpoD gene with RTrpoD-F& RT-rpoD-R. PCR result indicate the phoP gene was removed from the chromosome site.

Expression of the recombinant eukaryotic expression plasmid
pcDNA3.1(+)-CMV-SARS-CoV-2-S-GFP in 293T cells
In order to investigate the ability of pcDNA3.1(+)-CMV-SARS-CoV-2-S-GFP to express the SARSCoV-2-S protein, transfection, and western blot analysis were performed. A P2A ribosomal self-skipping
sequence separates SARS-CoV-2-S from a GFP marker. The strong CMV promoter was driving SARSCoV-2-S-GFP co-transcription and the P2A cleavage site separation of SARS-CoV-2-S and GFP during
translation in eukaryotic cells (Daniels et al., 2014). The results demonstrated that 293T cells transfected
with pcDNA3.1(+)-CMV-SARS-CoV-2-S-GFP expressed the SARS-CoV-2-S protein compared with
the cells transfected with the empty pcDNA3.1(+)-CMV-GFP plasmid (Fig. 3A–B).

Anti-SARS-CoV-2-S protein sera IgG responses in the rat
after orally Salmonella-mediated DNA vaccination
Rats (n = 9 per group) were orally immunized with ΔphoP strain with pSARS-CoV-2-S (1 x 107
cfu/(dose·rat)), or ΔphoP strain with controls (plasmid) (Fig. 4). Rats were immunized on days 0, 7, and
14. Sera were collected on days at 0, 14, and 28 days post-immunization (d.p.i). Estimate the antigenspecific humoral immune response after immunization with pSARS-CoV-2-S, antibody ELISA was
performed on the sera collected from the rat immunized with pSARS-CoV-2-S or control plasmid. The
pSARS-CoV-2-S vaccine-elicited humoral immune response, as evidenced by the fold increased
(pSARS-CoV-2-S group at 14 days, three rats of the nine rats increased to 4-5 times and another six rats
increase to 8-9 times when compared with the control group. At 28 days, all rats increase to 4-6 times
when compared with the control group, see Fig. 5) in the OD values between pSARS-CoV-2-S and
control groups (None increase in all experiment period ). This profile of IgG suggested that the novel
consensus oral vaccine strategy used in this study elicited an antigen-specific humoral immune response
(Fig. 5).

Discussion
Various strategies have been explored to search for an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, including
the use of inactivated whole virus particles, attenuated live virus and gene vaccines (Gao et al., 2020;
Smith et al., 2020; van Doremalen et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). Recently, the the
gene vaccines that express SARS-CoV structural proteins and induce host immunity against SARS-CoV2 have become increasingly popular.
Several bacterial species have been used to transfer eukaryotic expression plasmids into host cells.
Shigella flexneri, Listeria monocytogenes, and recombinant Escherichia coli that harbor the invasion
plasmid of Shigella have been used successfully (Gentschev et al., 2000; Schoen et al., 2004; Sizemore
et al., 1995). Since these bacteria escape from the phagosome, it has been postulated that entry into the
cytosol would be a crucial step in bacteria mediated transfection. Using attenuated strains of S. flexneri
and S.typhimurium as DNA carrier, antibody responses against the transgene could be detected in the
animal model (Darji et al., 2000; Fennelly et al., 1999).
Although oral administration of the vaccine is challenging, the socio-economic benefits of such
vaccination are apparent. Moreover, oral vaccination could stimulate both humoral and cellular immune
responses (De Smet et al., 2014). The most successful oral vaccine are the polio vaccine (Smith and
Leggat, 2005). Our design of pSARS-CoV-2-S plasmid-based orally delivered vaccine was able to

induce significant antigen-specific IgG antibodies. As indicated earlier, the COVID-19 protein SARSCoV-2-S is considered a robust putative vaccine target due to it being significantly associated with the
stimulation of SARS-CoV-2 (Smith et al., 2020). This protein was found to be immunogenic and capable
of eliciting a humoral response. Since the previous study developed a vaccine against MERS coronavirus;
and other published studies of SARS vaccines, S protein was chosen as the antigen target (Modjarrad et
al., 2019; Smith et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 S protein is a class I membrane fusion
protein, which the major envelope protein on the surface of coronaviruses. Initial studies have already
been performed, which indicate antibodies can block SARS-CoV-2 interaction with its host receptor
(ACE2) (Zhou et al., 2020). In vivo immunogenicity studies show the functional antibodies and T cell
responses in multiple animal models after SARS-CoV-2-S expression plasmid or mRNA direct
immunized to the animals or human (Smith et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). The oral administration of
the SARS-CoV-2-S oral vaccine was found to induce the response. In the following study, the protection
efficiency will be evaluated with a high dose of viral challenge in nonprimate mammals such as rhesus
monkey. In conclusion, attenuated Salmonella typhimurium carrying plasmid encoding SARS-CoV-2-S
is one of the promising candidates for developing an oral delivery vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection
in humans.
