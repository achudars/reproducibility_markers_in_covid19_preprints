Abstract

40

The newly identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes

41

COVID-19, a pandemic respiratory disease presenting with fever, cough, and often pneumonia.

42

Moreover, thromboembolic events throughout the body including the central nervous system (CNS)

43

have been described. Given first indication for viral RNA presence in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid

44

and in light of neurological symptoms in a large majority of COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2-

45

penetrance of the CNS is likely. By precisely investigating and anatomically mapping oro- and

46

pharyngeal regions and brains of 32 patients dying from COVID-19, we not only describe CNS

47

infarction due to cerebral thromboembolism, but also demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism. SARS-

48

CoV-2 enters the nervous system via trespassing the neuro-mucosal interface in the olfactory mucosa

49

by exploiting the close vicinity of olfactory mucosal and nervous tissue including delicate olfactory

50

and sensitive nerve endings. Subsequently, SARS-CoV-2 follows defined neuroanatomical structures,

51

penetrating defined neuroanatomical areas, including the primary respiratory and cardiovascular

52

control center in the medulla oblongata.

Introduction

55

There is increasing evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 not only affects the respiratory tract but

56

also impacts the CNS resulting in neurological symptoms such as loss of smell and taste, headache,

57

fatigue, nausea and vomiting in more than one third of COVID-19 patients1,2. Moreover, acute

58

cerebrovascular diseases and impaired consciousness have been described3. While recent studies

59

describe the presence of viral RNA in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)4,5 but lack a prove for

60

genuine SARS-CoV-2 manifestation, a systematic analysis of COVID-19 autopsy brains aimed at

61

understanding the port of SARS-CoV-2 entry and distribution within the CNS is lacking6.

62

The neuroinvasive potential of evolutionarily-related coronaviruses (CoVs) such as SARS-CoV

63

and MERS-CoV has previously been described7–9. SARS-CoV including SARS-CoV-2 enter human host

64

cells primarily by binding to the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and by the

65

action of the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming10. Supporting evidence comes from

66

animal studies demonstrating that SARS-CoV is capable of entering the brain upon intranasal

67

infection of mice expressing human ACE28,11. However, it is not known, which cells in the olfactory

68

mucosa express these molecules in steady state or under inflammatory or septic conditions11, while

69

there is first evidence for ACE2 expression in neuronal and glial cells in the CNS13,14. Along that line it

70

is of note, that the immunoglobulin superfamily member CD147, which is expressed in neuronal and

71

non-neuronal cells in the CNS15,16, has been shown to act as alternative cellular port for SARS-CoV-2

72

invasion17. To gain a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism and its mechanism of CNS

73

entry and distribution, we analyzed the cellular mucosal-nervous micro-milieu as first site of viral

74

infection and replication, followed by a thorough regional mapping of the consecutive olfactory

75

nervous tracts and defined CNS regions in 32 COVID-19 autopsy cases.

Results

78

Out of 32 COVID-19 autopsy cases, either proven to be RT-qPCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2

79

prior to death (N=29 of 32), or with clinical presentation highly suggestive of COVID-19 (N=3 of 32),

80

four patients (corresponding to 13%) presented with acute infarction due to ischemia caused by

81

(micro)thrombotic/thromboembolic events within the CNS (Supplementary Table 1). Similarly,

82

microthrombotic events were also detectable in the olfactory mucosa (Supplementary Figure 1).

83

Assessment of viral load by means of RT-qPCR in regionally well-defined tissue samples

84

including olfactory mucosa (region (R1), olfactory bulb (R2), oral mucosa (uvula; R3), trigeminal

85

ganglion (R4) and medulla oblongata (R5) demonstrated highest levels of SARS-CoV-2 copies per cell

86

within the olfactory mucosa sampled directly beneath the cribriform plate (N=13 of 22; Figure 1).

87

Lower levels of viral RNA were found in the cornea, conjunctiva and oral mucosa, highlighting the

88

oral and ophthalmic routes as additional potential sites of SARS-CoV-2 CNS entry (Figure 1). Only in

89

few cases the cerebellum was also positive (N=2 of 21), while the wall of the internal carotid artery,

90

which served as an internal negative control, was found to be negative in all investigated cases

91

(N=10). The assessment of subgenomic (sg) RNA as surrogate for active virus replication yielded a

92

positive result in 4 out of 13 SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive olfactory mucosa samples and in 2 out of 6

93

SARS-CoV-2 RNA-positive uvulae, but in none of the other tissues analyzed in this study

94

(Supplementary Table 1). Patients with shorter disease duration were more likely to be tested

95

positive for viral RNA in the CNS tissue (Supplementary Table 1). The anatomical proximity between

96

neurons, nerve fibers and mucosa within the oro- and nasopharynx (Figure 2) and the reported

97

clinical-neurological signs related to alteration in smell and taste perception suggest that SARS-CoV-2

98

exploits this neuro-mucosal interface as port of CNS entry. On the apical side of the olfactory

99

mucosa, dendrites of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) project into the nasal cavity, while on the

100

basal side axons of olfactory receptor neurons merge into fila, which protrude through the cribriform

101

plate directly into the olfactory bulb (Figure 2), thereby also having contact with the CSF18.

102

Further evidence and support for a site-specific infection and inflammation by SARS-CoV-2

103

was provided by immunohistochemistry (Figure 3). Cells of the olfactory mucosa showed strong

104

immunoreactivity in a characteristic perinuclear pattern when an antibody against the SARS-CoV

105

spike protein was used. Furthermore, early activated macrophages formed small cell clusters in the

106

epithelium expressing myeloid-related protein 14 (MRP14) (Supplementary Figure 2), initiating and

107

regulating an immune cascade, which e.g. upon influenza virus infection, has been shown to

108

orchestrate virus-associated inflammation by acting as endogenous damage-associated molecular

109

pattern (DAMP), ultimately initiating TLR4-MyD88 signalling19.

110

Additional support for SARS-CoV-2 persistence was provided by ultrastructural analyses of

111

ultrathin sections. We found Coronavirus-like particles (Figure 3) – despite subtle ultrastructural

112

differences compared to coronavirus derived from infected cell cultures providing a somewhat

113

different milieu (Supplementary Figure 3) - fulfilling the criteria of size, shape, substructure

114

(membrane, surface projections and internal electron dense material, resembling ribonucleoprotein)

115

and intracellular localization of Coronavirus particles, while being clearly distinct from intrinsic

116

cellular structures resembling Coronavirus particles20–25.

Discussion

120

We provide first evidence that SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion occurs at the neuro-mucosal

121

interface by transmucosal trespassing via regional nervous structures followed by a transport along

122

the olfactory tract of the CNS, thus explaining some of the well-documented neurological symptoms

123

in COVID-19 patients including alterations of smell and taste perception. Further studies are required

124

to identify the precise cellular and molecular entry mechanism as well as receptors in the olfactory

125

mucosa, where also non-neuronal pathways may play a role26. This will include a precise

126

characterization of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and of CD147 expression, which have been implicated in enabling

127

SARS-CoV-2 invasion in cells. Moreover, in line with recent clinical data demonstrating

128

thromboembolic CNS events described in few patients27, we found in 13% of the 32 investigated

129

cases also the histopathological correlate of microthrombosis and territorial brain infarcts.

130

The presence of genuine virus in the olfactory mucosa with its delicate olfactory and

131

sensitive – partially axonally damaged (Supplementary Figure 1) nerves in conjunction with SARS-

132

CoV-2 RNA manifestation preferentially in those neuroanatomical areas receiving olfactory tract

133

projections (Figure 1) may speak in favor of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion occurring via axonal transport.

134

However, several other mechanisms or routes, including transsynaptic transfer across infected

135

neurons, infection of vascular endothelium, or leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier

136

(BBB), or combinations thereof, be it in addition or exclusive, cannot be excluded at present14.

137

The detection of - compared to values measured in the lower respiratory tract

138

(Supplementary Table 1) - persistently high levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the olfactory mucosa (124%

139

as mean value compared to lower respiratory tract) up to 53 days after initial symptoms

140

(Supplementary Table 1), including the detection of sgRNA suggests that olfactory mucosa remains a

141

region of continuous SARS-CoV-2 replication and persistence, thus enabling a constant viral

142

replenishment for the CNS. In line with our findings there is a comparable SARS-CoV-2 infection

143

gradient from the nose to the lungs which is paralleled by expression of the receptor molecule

144

ACE228. Although this remains to be speculation and widespread dysregulation of homeostasis of

145

cardiovascular, pulmonal and renal systems has to be regarded as the leading cause in fatal COVID-19

146

cases, previous findings of SARS-CoV infection and other coronaviruses in the nervous system29 as

147

well as the herein described presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the medulla oblongata comprising the

148

primary respiratory and cardiovascular control center bring to mind the possibility that SARS-CoV2

149

infection, at least in some instances, can aggravate respiratory or cardiac problems - or even cause

150

failure - in a CNS-mediated manner6,30.

152

Even when following distinct routes upon first CNS entry and - based on our findings - in the

153

absence of clear signs of widespread distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the CNS (i.e. no signs of

154

meningitis/encephalitis in COVID-19 cases), it cannot be excluded that the virus may spread more

155

widely to other brain regions, thus eventually contributing to a more severe or even chronic disease

156

course, depending on various factors such as the time of virus persistence, viral load, and immune

157

status, amongst others.

Methods:

160

Study design

161

32 autopsy cases of either PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 patients (N=29 of 32) or of patients

162

clinically highly suggestive of COVID-19 (N=3 out of 32) were included. Autopsies were performed at

163

the Department of Neuropathology and the Institute of Pathology, Charité - Universitätsmedizin

164

Berlin (N=25 out of 32) including one referral case from the Institute of Pathology, DRK Kliniken

165

Berlin, the Institutes of Pathology and of Neuropathology, University Medicine Göttingen (N=6 out of

166

32) and the Institute of Forensic Medicine Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin (N=1 out of 32). This

167

study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Charité (EA 1/144/13 and EA2/066/20) as well as

168

by the Charité-BIH COVID-19 research board and was in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

169

In all deceased patients a whole-body autopsy was performed, which included a thorough

170

histopathologic and molecular evaluation comprising virological assessment of SARS-CoV-2 RNA

171

levels as indicated in Supplementary Table 1. Clinical records were assessed for pre-existing medical

172

conditions and medications, current medical course, and ante-mortem diagnostic findings.

173

SARS-CoV- and SARS-CoV-2-specific PCR including subgenomic RNA assessment

174

RNA was purified from ∼50 mg of homogenized tissue from all organs by using the MagNAPure 96

175

system and the MagNA Pure 96 DNA and Viral NA Large Volume Kit (Roche) following the

176

manufacturer's instructions.

177

Quantitative real-time PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was performed on RNA extracts with RT-qPCR targeting

178

the SARS-CoV-2 E-gene. Quantification of viral RNA was done using photometrically quantified in

179

vitro RNA transcripts as described previously33. Total DNA was measured in all extracts by using the

180

Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Karlsruhe, Germany).

181

Detection of subgenomic RNA (sgRNA), as correlate of active virus replication in the tested tissue was

182

done using oligonucleotides targeting the leader transcriptional regulatory sequence and region

183

within the sgRNA coding for the SARS-CoV-2 E gene, as described previously34.

187

Electron microscopy

188

Autopsy tissues were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer, postfixed

189

with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.05M sodium cacodylate, dehydrated using graded acetone series,

190

then infiltrated and embedded in Renlam resin. En bloc staining with uranyl acetate and

191

phosphotungstic acid was performed at the 70% acetone dehydration step. 500 nm semithin sections

192

were cut using an ultramicrotome (Ultracut E, Reichert-Jung) and a histo jumbo diamond knife

193

(Diatome), transferred onto glass slides, stretched at 120°C on a hot plate and stained with Toluidine

194

blue at 80°C. 70 nm ultrathin sections were cut using the same ultramicrotome and an ultra 35°

195

diamond knife (Diatome), stretched with xylene vapor, collected onto pioloform coated slot grids and

196

then stained with lead citrate. Standard TEM was performed using a Zeiss 906 in conjunction with a

197

2k CCD camera (TRS). Large-scale digitization was performed using a Zeiss Gemini 300 field-emission

198

scanning electron microscope in conjunction with a STEM-detector via Atlas 5 software at 4-6 nm

199

pixel size. Regions of interest of the large-scale datasets were saved by annotation (“mapped”) and

200

then recorded at very high resolution using 0.5-1 nm pixel size.

201

Immunohistochemical procedures and stainings

202

Routine histological stainings (Hematoxylin and eosin (HE), Masson-Goldner, Periodic acid-Schiff

203

reaction (PAS), and Toluidine blue) were performed according to standard procedures.

204

Immunohistochemical stainings were either performed on a Benchmark XT autostainer (Ventana

205

Medical Systems, Tuscon, AZ, USA) with standard antigen retrieval methods (CC1 buffer, pH8.0,

206

Ventana Medical Systems, Tuscon, AZ, USA) or manually using 4-μm-thick FFPE tissue sections. The

207

following primary antibodies were used: monoclonal mouse anti-S100 (DAKO Z0311, 1:3000),

208

monoclonal mouse anti-AE1/AE3 (DAKO M3515, 1:200), monoclonal mouse anti-MRP14 (Acris,

209

BM4026B, 1:500, pretreatment protease), monoclonal mouse anti-CD56 (Serotec, ERIC-1, 1:200),

210

mouse monoclonal anti-SARS spike glycoprotein antibody (Abcam, ab272420, 1:100, pretreatment

211

Citrate + MW) and polyclonal rabbit anti-OLIG2 (IBL, 18953, 1:150, pretreatment Tris-EDTA + MW).

212

Briefly, primary antibodies were applied and developed either using the iVIEW DAB Detection Kit

213

(Ventana Medical Systems) and the ultraView Universal Alkaline Phosphatase Red Detection Kit

214

(Ventana Medical Systems) or by manual application of biotinylated secondary antibodies (Merck,

215

RPN1001, RPN1004), peroxidase-conjugated avidin, and diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma, D5637) or 3-

216

Amino-9-Ethylcarbazol (AEC). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated in graded

217

alcohol and xylene, mounted and coverslipped. IHC stained sections were evaluated by at least two

218

board-certified neuropathologists with concurrence. For data handling of whole slides images an

219

OME-TIFF workflow was used35.
