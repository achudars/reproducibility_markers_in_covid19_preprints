Yeast-expressed SARS-CoV-2 RBD
17

Abstract

18

There is an urgent need for an accessible and low-cost COVID-19 vaccine suitable for low- and

19

middle-income countries. Here we report on the development of a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding

20

domain (RBD) protein, expressed at high levels in yeast (Pichia pastoris), as a suitable vaccine

21

candidate against COVID-19. After introducing two modifications into the wild-type RBD gene to

22

reduce yeast-derived hyperglycosylation and improve stability during protein expression, we show

23

that the recombinant protein, RBD219-N1C1, is equivalent to the wild-type RBD recombinant

24

protein (RBD219-WT) in an in vitro ACE-2 binding assay. Immunogenicity studies of RBD219-

25

N1C1 and RBD219-WT proteins formulated with Alhydrogel® were conducted in mice, and, after

26

two doses, both the RBD219-WT and RBD219-N1C1 vaccines induced high levels of binding IgG

27

antibodies. Using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, we further showed that sera obtained after a two-dose

28

immunization schedule of the vaccines were sufficient to elicit strong neutralizing antibody titers in

29

the 1:1,000 to 1:10,000 range, for both antigens tested. The vaccines induced IFN-, IL-6, and IL-10

30

secretion, among other cytokines. Overall, these data suggest that the RBD219-N1C1 recombinant

31

protein, produced in yeast, is suitable for further evaluation as a human COVID-19 vaccine, in

32

particular, in an Alhydrogel® containing formulation and possibly in combination with other

33

immunostimulants.

The number of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) cases globally is readily approaching the 50-

36

million-person mark, with over 1.2 million deaths. In response to the pandemic, an international

37

enterprise to develop effective and safe vaccines is underway. There are many ways to categorize the

38

more than 100 potential COVID-19 vaccine candidates1, but one approach is to divide them as those

39

employing new technologies for production, but that have not yet been licensed for use, versus

40

traditional vaccine production approaches with prior experience in licensed vaccines2. The Operation

41

Warp Speed (OWS) initiative in the United States3 and other similar efforts in other parts of the

42

world4 initially seemed to focus on approaches employing new platforms, including several

43

messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines as well as non-replicating adenovirus vector vaccines3.

44

Among the more established or traditional approaches, whole-inactivated virus vaccines on

45

aluminum oxy-hydroxide have been developed in China5, as have several recombinant protein

46

vaccine candidates6-8. Each of these approaches offers both distinct advantages and disadvantages in

47

terms of production, scale-up, potential efficacy and safety, and delivery.

48

Introduction

We have previously reported on recombinant protein-based coronavirus vaccine candidates,

49

formulated with Alhydrogel® to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)9-11 and Middle

50

East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)12. In both cases, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the

51

SARS or MERS spike proteins was used as the target vaccine antigen. In a mouse model, the SARS-

52

CoV RBD219-N1/Alhydrogel® vaccine induced high titers of virus-neutralizing antibodies and

53

protective immunity against a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV virus challenge. It was also found to

54

minimize or prevent eosinophilic immune enhancement compared to the full spike protein9.

55

The RBD of SARS-CoV-2 has likewise attracted interest from several groups now entering

56

clinical trials with RBD-based vaccines7,13-17. Our approach was to apply the lessons learned from the

57

development of the SARS-CoV vaccine candidate and accelerate the COVID-19 vaccine

development efforts using microbial fermentation in the yeast Pichia pastoris; a technology that is

59

widely available and used to produce recombinant hepatitis B vaccines in several middle-income

60

countries (LMICs)18, including Bangladesh, Brazil, Cuba, India, and Indonesia. As COVID-19

61

spreads across the globe, especially among urban populations living in extreme poverty19, there will

62

be greater urgency to produce safe, effective, highly scalable, and affordable COVID-19 vaccines

63

locally or regionally. Therefore, the development of a yeast-expressed recombinant protein-based

64

COVID-19 vaccine allows developing it for global health and populations vulnerable to poverty-

65

related diseases20.

66

Here, we present the first preclinical data of a COVID-19 recombinant protein-based vaccine

67

candidate, SARS-CoV2 RBD219-N1C1, formulated with Alhydrogel®. We demonstrate that

68

modifications made to the SARS-CoV2 RBD gene to improve production and stability preserve the

69

protein antigen functionality and its immunogenicity after Alhydrogel® adsorption.

Methods

72

2.1

Cloning and expression of the genes encoding RBD219-WT and RBD219-N1C1:

73

The RBD219-WT recombinant subunit protein contains amino acid residues 331-549 of the SARS-

74

CoV-2 spike protein (GenBank No.: QHD43416.1). It contains a hexahistidine tag at its C-terminus.

75

In the tag-free RBD219-N1C1 antigen candidate, N331 is not present, and C538 has been mutant to

76

an alanine residue to prevent aggregation due to intermolecular disulfide bonding. The DNAs for

77

both antigen candidates were individually synthesized with their codon use optimized for translation

78

in Pichia pastoris and ligated into pPICZA using the EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites (GenScript,

79

Piscataway, NJ, USA). The recombinant plasmids were electroporated into P. pastoris X33 following

80

the EasySelectTM Pichia Expression Kit Manual (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Transformants

81

were selected on YPD plates containing different concentrations of Zeocin (100-2000 g/mL) and

82

incubated at 30°C for 72 hours. Individual colonies were screened for expression under induction

83

with methanol (0.5-2%) at the 10 mL culture level (MMGY medium) as described10. The expression

84

level of select colonies was identified by SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting using anti-SARS-CoV-2

85

antibodies (anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike rabbit monoclonal antibody, Sino Biological, Wayne, PA, USA,

86

Cat # 40150-R007), and research seed stocks of the highest expressing clones were frozen at –80 °C.

87

RBD219-WT and RBD219-N1C1 were expressed at the 5 L scale using a Celligen 310

88

benchtop fermentation system (Eppendorf, Enfield, CT, USA). For the RBD-WT, 2.5 L of basal salt

89

medium were inoculated with a seed culture to an initial OD600 of 0.05 and grown at 30 °C, pH 5.0

90

with 30% dissolved oxygen until glycerol depletion. During the first hour of methanol induction, the

91

temperature was reduced from 30 °C to 26 °C and the pH was increased from 5.0 to 6.0. After

92

approximately 70 hours of induction (methanol feed at 1-11 mL/L/hr), the culture was harvested

93

from the fermenter, and cells were removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 12,227 x g at 4 °C. For

94

RBD219-N1C1, the fermentation process was slightly different in that low salt medium was used, the

95

induction temperature was set to 25 °C and the pH to 6.5 and, the methanol feed rate was between 1-

96

15 ml/L/hr. The fermentation supernatant (FS) was filtered (0.45 m PES filter) and stored at -80 °C

97

before purification.

98

A hexahistidine-tagged SARS-CoV-2 RBD219-WT was purified from fermentation

99

supernatant (FS) by immobilized metal affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion

100

chromatography (SEC). The FS was concentrated and buffer exchanged to buffer A (20 mM Tris-

101

HCl pH 7.5 and 0.5 M NaCl) using a Pellicon 2 cassette with a 10 kDa MWCO membrane

102

(MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA) before being applied to a Ni-Sepharose column (Cytiva,

103

Marlborough, MA, USA). The column was washed with buffer A plus 30 mM imidazole and elution

104

was undertaken in buffer A containing 250 mM imidazole. The RBD219-WT protein was further

105

purified using a Superdex 75 prep grade column (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA) pre-equilibrated

106

in buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and 150 mM NaCl) after concentrating eluates from the Ni

107

column using an Amicon Ultra-15 concentrator with a 10 kDa MWCO membrane (MilliporeSigma,

108

Burlington, MA, USA). Monomeric RBD219-WT was pooled, aseptically filtered using a 0.22 µm

109

filter, and stored at -80 °C.

110

For the purification of the tag-less RBD219-N1C1, ammonium sulfate salt was added to the

111

FS to a final concentration of 1 M (w/v) before the sample was applied to a Butyl Sepharose HP

112

column (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA). The column was washed with buffer C (30 mM Tris-HCl

113

pH 8.0) with 1 M ammonium sulfate and protein was eluted with buffer C containing 0.4 M

114

ammonium sulfate. A polishing step using a Superdex 75 prep grade column (Cytiva, Marlborough,

115

MA, USA) pre-equilibrated in buffer B followed.

To evaluate the size of RBD219-WT and RBD219-N1C1, 2 μg of these two proteins were loaded

119

onto a 4-20% tris-glycine gel under non-reduced and reduced conditions. These two proteins were

120

also treated with PNGase-F (NEB, Ipswitch, MA, USA) under the reduced condition to remove N-

121

glycans and loaded on the gel to assess the impact of the glycans on the protein size. Gels were

122

stained using Coomassie Blue and analyzed using a Bio-Rad G900 densitometer with Image Lab

123

software.

Vaccine formulation and Alhydrogel®-protein binding study

125

2.3

126

SARS-CoV-2 RBD219-N1C1 was diluted in 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5 (TBS buffer) before

127

mixing with Alhydrogel® (aluminum oxy-hydroxide; Catalog # 250-843261 EP, Brenntag, Ballerup,

128

Denmark). To calculate the Langmuir binding isotherm of RBD219-N1C1 to Alhydrogel®, RBD219-

129

N1C1 and Alhydrogel® were mixed at different ratios (from 1:2 to 1:20). The RBD219-

130

N1C1/Alhydrogel® mixture was stored for one hour at RT, to reach an equilibrium state. The

131

Alhydrogel® formulations were centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 5 min, and the supernatant was

132

removed. The protein in the supernatant fraction and the pellet fraction were quantified using a micro

133

BCA assay (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA).

134
135

2.4

ACE-2 binding assay

136

For the ACE-2 binding study, the Alhydrogel®-RBD vaccine formulations were blocked overnight

137

with 0.1% BSA. After hACE-2-Fc (LakePharma, San Carlos, CA, USA) was added, the samples

138

were incubated for 2 hours at RT. After incubation, the Alhydrogel® was spun down at 13,000 x g for

139

5 min. The hACE-2-Fc which did not bind to the RBD on the Alhydrogel® remained in the

140

supernatant. The hACE-2-Fc content in the supernatant was quantified by ELISA using 96-Well

141

MaxiSorp Immuno plates (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA) coated overnight with 200 ng/well of

142

RBD219-WT protein. After blocking with 0.1% BSA, 100 µL supernatant sample were added to

143

each well. Plates were washed 4 times with an automated plate washer using PBS with Tween

144

(PBST). A secondary antibody against human Fc was used to detect hACE-2-Fc bound the proteins

145

on the plate. Plates were washed 5 times with an automated plate washer using PBST before 100 µL

146

TMB solution were added. The enzymatic reaction was stopped with HCl and absorption readings

147

were made at 450 nm. The final concentration of the hACE-2 bound on the Alhydrogel® was

148

determined as [hACE-2-Fc on Alhydrogel®] = [Total hACE-2-Fc] – [hACE-2-Fc in supernatant].

149
150

2.5

Immunogenicity testing

151

To examine RBD-specific antibodies in mouse sera, indirect ELISAs were conducted. 96-well

152

NUNC ELISA plates were coated with 2 g/mL RBD219-WT in 100 L 1x coating buffer per well

153

and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The next day the coating buffer was discarded, and plates were

154

blocked with 200 L/well 0.1% BSA in PBST for 2 hours at room temperature. Mouse serum

155

samples were diluted from 1:200 to 1: 437,400 in 0.1% BSA in PBST. Blocked ELISA plates were

156

washed once with 300 L PBST using a Biotek 405TS plate washer and diluted mouse serum

157

samples were added to the plate in duplicate, 100 L/well. As negative controls, pooled naïve mouse

158

serum (1:200 diluted) and blanks (0.1% BSA PBST) were added as well. Plates were incubated for 2

159

hours at room temperature, before being were washed four times with PBST. Subsequently, 1:6,000

160

diluted goat anti-mouse IgG HRP antibody (100 L/well) was added in 0.1% BSA in PBST. Plates

161

were incubated 1 hour at room temperature, before washing five times with PBST, followed by the

162

addition of 100 L/well TMB substrate. Plates were incubated for 15 min at room temperature while

163

protected from light. After incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 L/well 1 M HCl. The

absorbance at a wavelength of 450 nm was measured using a BioTek Epoch 2 spectrophotometer.

165

Duplicate values of raw data from the OD450 were averaged. The titer cutoff value was calculated

166

using the following formula: Titer cutoff = 3 x average of negative control + 3 x standard deviation

167

of the negative control. For each sample, the titer was determined as the lowest dilution of each

168

mouse sample with an average OD450 value above the titer cutoff. When a serum sample did not

169

show any signal at all and a titer could not be calculated, an arbitrary baseline titer value of 67 was

170

assigned to that sample (baseline).

172

2.6

173

Pseudovirus was prepared in HEK-293T cells by previously reported methods21. Cells were

174

transfected with 2.5 µg of the plasmid encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (p278-1) and 3.7 µg

175

of luciferase-encoding reporter plasmid (pNL4-3.lucR-E) and Gag/Pol-encoding packaging construct

176

(p∆8.9). Pseudovirus containing supernatant was recovered after 48 h and passed through a 0.45 µM

177

filter before use.

178

Pseudovirus assay:

For each serum sample, 30 µL pseudovirus were incubated with serial dilutions of heat-

179

inactivated serum (eight dilutions in a 4-fold step-wise manner) for 1 h at 37 °C. Next, 100 µL of

180

these sera-pseudovirus mixtures were added to 293T-hACE2 cells in 96-well poly-D-lysine coated

181

culture plates. Following 48 h incubation in a 5% CO2 environment at 37 °C, the cells were lysed

182

with 100 µL Promega Glo Lysis buffer, 15 min RT. Finally, 20 µL lysate was added to 100 µL luc

183

substrate (Promega Luciferase Assay System, Madison, WI, USA). The amount of luciferase was

184

quantified by luminescence (relative luminescence units (RLU)), using a Promega GloMax

185

luminometer (Steady-Glo program). The percent virus inhibition was calculated as (1- RLU of

186

sample/ RLU of negative control) x 100. Serum from vaccinated mice was also characterized by the

187

IC50-value, defined as the serum dilution at which the virus infection was reduced to 50% compared

with the negative control (virus + cells). When a serum sample did not neutralize 50% of the virus

189

when added at a 1:10 dilution, the IC50 titer could not be calculated and an arbitrary baseline titer

190

value of 10 was assigned to that sample (baseline). As a control, human convalescent sera for SARS-

2.8.1 Preparation of splenocytes for restimulation

201

Single-cell suspensions from mouse splenocytes were prepared using a cell dissociator

202

(GentleMACS Octo Dissociator, Miltenyi Biotec, Waltham, MA, USA) based on a previously

203

optimized protocol22. The concentration and the viability of the splenocyte suspensions were

204

measured after mixing with AOPI dye and counted using the Nexcelom Cellometer Auto 2000

205

(Lawrence, MA, USA).

206

For the re-stimulation assays, splenocyte suspensions were diluted to 8x106 live cells/mL in a

207

2-mL deep-well dilution plate and 125 L of each sample was seeded in two 96-well tissue culture

208

treated culture plates. Splenocytes were re-stimulated with 10 g/mL RBD219-WT, 20 ng/mL PMA

209

+ 1 g/mL Ionomycin or just media (unstimulated). For the flow cytometry plate, the PMA/I was not

added until the next day. 125 L (2x concentration) of each stimulant was mixed with the 125 L

211

splenocytes suspension in the designated wells. After all the wells were prepared, the plates were

212

incubated at 37 °C 5% CO2. One plate was used for the cytokine release assay, while the other plate

213

was used for flow cytometry. For flow cytometry, another plate was prepared with splenocytes,

214

which would be later used as fluorescence minus one – controls (FMOs).

215

2.8.2 In vitro cytokine release assay

216

After 48 hours in the incubator, splenocytes were briefly mixed by pipetting. Then plates were

217

centrifuged for 5 min at 400 x g at RT. Without disturbing the pellet 50 L supernatant was

218

transferred to two skirted PCR plates and frozen at – 20 °C until use.

219

For the in vitro cytokine release assay, splenocytes were seeded in a 96-well culture plate at

220

1x106 live cells in 250 µL cRPMI. Splenocytes were then (re-)stimulated with either 10 µg/mL

221

RBD219-WT protein, 10 µg/mL RBD219-N1C1 protein, PMA/Iomycin (positive control), or nothing

222

(negative control) for 48 hours at 37 °C 5% CO2. After incubation, 96-well plates were centrifuged to

223

pellet the splenocytes down and supernatant was transferred to a new 96-well plate. The supernatant

224

was stored at -20°C until assayed. A Milliplex Mouse Th17 Luminex kit (MD MilliPore) with

225

analytes IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-17A, IL-23, IFN-γ, and TNF-α was

226

used to quantify the cytokines secreted in the supernatant by the re-stimulated splenocytes. An

227

adjusted protocol based on the manufacturers' recommendations was used with adjustments to use

228

less sample and kit materials23. The readout was performed using a MagPix Luminex instrument.

229

Raw data was analyzed using Bio-Plex Manager software, and further analysis was done with Excel

230

and Prism.

2.8.3 Cytokine production of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells

232

Surface staining and intracellular cytokine staining followed by flow cytometry was performed to

233

measure the amount of activated (CD44=) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells producing IFN-, IL-2, TNF-,

234

and IL-4 upon re-stimulation with S2RBD219 WT.

235

Five hours before the 24-hour re-stimulation incubation, Brefeldin A was added to block

236

cytokines from secretion. PMA/I was also added to designated wells as a positive control. After the

237

incubation, splenocytes were stained for the relevant markers. A viability dye and an Fc Block were

238

also used to remove dead cells in the analysis and to minimize non-specific staining, respectively.

239

After staining, splenocytes were analyzed using an Attune NxT flow cytometer instrument at

240

the Baylor College of Medicine Cytometry and Cell Sorting Core. Raw data was analyzed in

241

VenturiOne software and gating results were copied in Excel. The %-gating values from the non-

242

stimulated controls were subtracted from the re-stimulated controls to observe the difference in %-

243

gating induced by the re-stimulation.

244

The gating strategy from the analysis of the results is shown in Supplemental Figure 1. From

245

all events collected the doublets are removed to obtain only single-cell events. Then events are

246

selected on size and granularity to obtain splenocytes only. Following the removal of dead

247

splenocytes, a gate is set to only select Activated (CD44+) T cells (CD3+)24. T cells are then

248

separated into CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. For T helper cells the events positive

249

for IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-2, and IL-4 were selected, while for cytotoxic T cells only IFN-, TNF-, and

250

IL-2 positive events were gated.

Results

252

Here we report on the expression of a modified, recombinant RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

253

using the yeast (P. pastoris) expression system. The candidate antigen selection, modifications, and

254

production processes were based on eight years of process development, manufacture, and preclinical

255

prior experience with a SARS-CoV recombinant protein-based receptor-binding domain (RBD)9-11.

256

The RBDs of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS‑CoV share significant amino acid sequence similarity

257

(>75% identity, >80% homology) and both use the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)

258

receptor for cell entry25,26. Process development using the same procedures and strategies used for the

259

production, scale-up, and manufacture of the SARS-CoV recombinant protein allowed for a rapid

260

acceleration in the development of a scalable and reproducible production process for the

261

SARS‑CoV-2 RBD219-N1C1 protein, suitable for its technological transfer to a manufacturer.

262

We found that the modifications used to minimize yeast-derived hyperglycosylation and

263

optimize the yield, purity, and stability of the SARS-CoV RBD219-N1 protein were also relevant to

264

the SARS-CoV-2 RBD expression and production process. The modified SARS-CoV-2 antigen,

265

RBD219-N1C1, when formulated on Alhydrogel®, was shown to induce virus-neutralizing antibodies

266

in mice, equivalent to those levels elicited by the wild-type (RBD219-WT) recombinant protein

267

counterpart.

268

3.1

269

The wild-type SARS-CoV-2 RBD amino acid sequence comprises residues 331-549 of the spike (S)

270

protein (GenBank: QHD43416.1) of the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate (GenBank: MN908947.3) (Figure 1).

271

In the RBD-219-WT construct, the gene fragment was expressed in P. pastoris. After fermentation at

272

the 5 L scale, the hexahistidine-tagged protein was purified by immobilized metal affinity

273

chromatography, followed by size-exclusion chromatography. We observed glycosylation and

274

aggregation during these initial expression and purification studies, and therefore, similar to our

previous strategy 10, we generated a modified construct, the RBD219-N1C1, by deleting the N331

276

residue and mutating the C538 residue to alanine. The additional mutation of C538 to A538 was done

277

because we observed that in the wild-type sequence nine cysteine residues likely would form four

278

disulfide bonds. Therefore, the C538 residue was likely available for intermolecular cross-linking,

279

leading to aggregation. As a result, in the RBD219-N1C1 construct, and based on the modifications,

280

the Pichia-derived hyperglycosylation, as well as aggregation via intermolecular disulfide bridging,

281

were greatly reduced. We note that the deleted and mutated residues are structurally far from the

282

immunogenic epitopes and specifically the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the RBD (Figure 1). On

283

SDS-PAGE tris-glycine gels, the RBD219-WT protein migrated at approximately 28 kDa under non-

284

reduced conditions and 33 kDa in the reduced condition, while the RBD219-N1C1 protein migrated

285

at approximately 24 kDa under non-reduced conditions and 29 kDa under reduced conditions.

286

However, after the N-glycans were removed enzymatically, these two proteins showed a similar

287

molecular weight of approximately 25 kDa (Supplemental Figure 2). The purity of both proteins

288

was analyzed by densitometry resulting in levels >95%.

ACE-2 binds to recombinant SARS‑CoV-2 RBD219-N1C1 protein formulated on
Alhydrogel®

300

When mixing 25 µg of either RBD219-WT or RBD219-N1C1 proteins to 500 µg of Alhydrogel®, we

301

observed that >98% of the proteins bind to Alhydrogel® after 15 min of incubation. Only when the

302

Alhydrogel® was reduced to less than 100 µg (Alhydrogel®/RBD219 ratio <4), the Alhydrogel®

303

surface was saturated, and protein started to be detected in the supernatant (Figure 2A). It is known

304

that unbound protein may impact the immunogenicity of the vaccine formulation, therefore we

305

proceeded to only evaluate formulations with Alhydrogel®/RBD219 ratios higher than 4.

306

Figure 2B shows that hACE-2-Fc, a recombinant version of the human receptor used by the

307

virus to enter the host cells, can bind with the RBD proteins that are adsorbed on the surface of the

308

Alhydrogel®. This demonstrates that bound RBD proteins are structurally and possibly functionally

309

active and that after adsorption the protein does not undergo any significant conformational changes

310

that could result in the loss of possible key epitopes around the receptor-binding motif (RBM).

311

We saw no statistical differences between the binding of hACE-2-Fc to RBD219-WT (red,

312

Figure 2B) or RBD219-N1C1 (green, Figure 2B) proteins, based on an unpaired t-test (P=0.670).

313

Likewise, we saw no relation between the amount of Alhydrogel® to which the RBD was bound and

314

the interaction with hACE-2-Fc, indicating that the surface density of the RBD proteins on the

315

Alhydrogel® plays no role in the presentation of ACE binding sites.

Recombinant RBD219-N1C1 protein, formulated with Alhydrogel®, elicits a strong

neutralizing antibody response in mice

325

The recombinant RBD219-N1C1 protein (25 g) was formulated with various amounts (100 – 500

326

g) of Alhydrogel®. Controls included a cohort receiving only Alhydrogel® and another receiving the

327

RBD219-WT antigen, also formulated with 500 g Alhydrogel®. Six- to eight-week-old female

328

BALB/c mice were immunized 2-3 times subcutaneously at approximately 21-day intervals (Figure

329

3A). Blood samples were taken on day 35 from all study animals to assess total IgG antibody titers,

330

as well as neutralizing antibody titers (Dataset 1). Half of the mice, those with the highest IgG titers

331

in their respective group, were euthanized on day 43 to allow the evaluation of the cellular immune

332

response after two immunizations. For this dataset (Dataset 2), we also measured IgG and

neutralizing antibody titers. The remaining mice received a third vaccination on day 43 and were

334

euthanized on day 57 for the assessment of humoral and cellular immune responses (Dataset 3).

335

Humoral immune response: On day 35 (Dataset 1), after receiving two vaccinations, all

336

groups that had received the recombinant protein formulated with at least 200 g Alhydrogel®

337

produced similar and robust IgG titers. The group receiving the protein with only 100 g

338

Alhydrogel®, produced a lower IgG response, albeit slightly higher than the negative control that had

339

been immunized with 500 g Alhydrogel® alone (Figure 3B, Supplemental Table 1). Importantly,

340

based on a Mann-Whitney test, we determined that there was no statistical difference between the

341

groups vaccinated with the modified and the wild-type version of the RBD protein (p=0.3497). The

342

average neutralizing antibody titers observed on day 35 (IC50 range: 5.0x103 to 9.4x103,

343

Supplemental Table 2) matched with the total IgG titers, showing equally high IC50 values for all

344

vaccines that contained at least 200 g Alhydrogel® and lower IC50 values for the vaccine with only

345

100 g Alhydrogel® and no IC50 values for the adjuvant-only control (Figure 3C).

346

On day 43, 22 days after receiving the boost vaccination, half of the mice in each group

347

(N=4), those with the highest IgG titers, were sacrificed to determine the total IgG, the IgG subtypes,

348

and the neutralizing antibody titers. As we observed on day 35, all animals that had received the

349

vaccine produced strong antibody titers, with the groups receiving >200 g Alhydrogel® eliciting a

350

higher titer than those that received only 100 g of Alhydrogel®, albeit no statistical significance was

351

detected (Figures 3B). For all animals, as typical for vaccine formulations containing aluminum, the

352

IgG2a:IgG1 titer ratio was <0.1 (Supplemental Figure 3). In the pseudovirus neutralization assay

353

for the day 43 samples (Figure 3C), all vaccines containing >200 g Alhydrogel® elicited IC50 titers

354

that, on average, were several-fold higher than on day 35 (IC50 range: 1.1x104 to 1.2x105,

355

Supplemental Table 2). There again was no difference between the RBD219-WT and RBD-N1C1

356

vaccines.

On day 57, all remaining animals were sacrificed. In contrast to the animals studied on days

358

35 and 43, these animals had received a second boost vaccination. A robust immune response in all

359

vaccinated mice, including those immunized with the protein adsorbed to 100 g Alhydrogel®

360

achieved high average IgG titers. The total IgG titers in the mice sacrificed on day 57, had increased

361

after the third vaccination, compared to the titers seen on day 35. Likewise, we observed a

362

corresponding increase in the average IC50 values (IC50 range: 3.8x102 to 1.1x104, Supplemental

363

Table 2) for all animals, including those immunized with the protein adsorbed to 100 g

364

Alhydrogel®. Interestingly, for this time point, the cohort receiving 25 g RBD219-N1C1 with 500

365

g Alhydrogel® appeared to show higher neutralizing antibody titers than the corresponding

366

RBD219-WT group, albeit that difference was not statistically significant.

Cellular immunity: For all animals sacrificed on day 43 (having received two vaccinations)

377

and day 57 (having received three vaccinations), the cellular immune response was characterized

378

through the restimulation of isolated mouse splenocytes with the recombinant RBD219-WT protein.

379

For all samples, we employed Flow Cytometry to quantify intracellular cytokines in CD4+ and CD8+

380

cells after restimulation (Figure 4A). On day 43, high percentages of CD4+-IL-4 and, to a slightly

381

lesser extent CD4+-TNF producing cells were detected. Conversely, as expected for an

382

Alhydrogel®-adjuvanted vaccine, low levels of IL-2 producing CD4+ cells were seen. In a cytokine

383

release assay, strong IFN-, IL-6, and IL-10 secretion was observed independent of whether the

384

animals had received two or three immunizations, whereas low amounts of secreted Th1-typical

385

cytokines such as IL-2 or IL-12 were seen (Figure 4B).

397

Here we report on a yeast-expressed SARS-CoV-2 RBD219-N1C1 protein and its potential as a

398

vaccine candidate antigen for preventing COVID-19. Building on extensive prior experience

399

developing vaccines against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV10-12, we initially selected and compared the

400

SARS-CoV-2 RBD219-WT and the SARS-CoV-2 RBD219-N1C1 proteins for their potential to

401

induce high titers of virus-neutralizing antibodies, T-cell responses, and protective immunity.

402

Discussion

Previously we observed that the SARS-CoV RBD219-N1 antigen, formulation with

403

Alhydrogel® elicited high levels of neutralizing antibodies without evidence of eosinophilic immune

404

enhancement. That RBD-based vaccine was even superior to the full-length spike protein in inducing

405

specific antibodies and fully protected mice from SARS-CoV infection while preventing eosinophilic

406

pulmonary infiltrates in the lungs upon challenge9.

407

In this work, using the SARS-CoV-2 RBD219 protein analog, we observed that, just like in

408

the case of the SARS-CoV RBD antigen, the deletion of the N-terminal asparagine residue reduced

409

hyperglycosylation, thus allowing for easier purification of the antigen obtained from the yeast

410

expression system. Moreover, mutagenesis of a free cysteine residue further improved protein

411

production through the reduction of aggregation. Based on the predicted structure of the RBD, no

412

impact on the functionality of the RBD219-N1C1 antigen was expected, and using an ACE-2 in vitro

413

binding assay we indeed showed similarity to the RBD219-WT antigen. In addition, we showed that,

414

in mice, the modified RBD219-N1C1 antigen triggered an equivalent immune response to the

415

RBD219-WT protein when both proteins were adjuvanted with Alhydrogel®.

416

Similar to our previous findings with the SARS-CoV RBD antigen9, we show the RBD219-

417

N1C1 protein when formulated with Alhydrogel® elicits a robust neutralizing antibody response with

418

IC50 values up to 4.3x105 in mice, as well as an expected T-cell immunological profile. Some of the

419

titers of virus-neutralizing antibodies exceed the titer, 2.4x104, measured in-house with human

420

convalescent serum research reagent for SARS-CoV-2 (NIBSC 20/130, National Institute for Biological

421

Standards and Control, UK).

422

In a mouse virus challenge model for the SARS CoV RBD recombinant protein vaccine, we

423

found that Alhydrogel® formulations induced high levels of protective immunity but did not

424

stimulate eosinophilic immune enhancement, suggesting that Alhydrogel® may even reduce immune

425

enhancement. This prior experience offers the potential for Alhydrogel® as a key adjuvant for

426

consideration during coronavirus vaccine development27. Such findings have led to a reframing of the

427

basis for immune enhancement linked to coronavirus respiratory infections28. A recent analysis and

428

review by the NIH ACTIV Vaccine Working Group confirms that aluminum or Th2 responses

429

remain viable options for vaccine development concluding that “it is not possible to clearly prioritize

430

or down-select vaccine antigens, adjuvants, biotechnology platforms, or delivery mechanisms based

431

on general immunological principles or the available preclinical data”29.

432

Therefore, the RBD219-N1C1 vaccine antigen on Alhydrogel® merits its evaluation as a

433

COVID-19 vaccine possibly with or without other immunostimulants. Looking at the landscape of

434

recombinant protein-based COVID-19 vaccines, the WHO lists several advanced COVID-19

435

candidates that are based on recombinant proteins30, and at least seven COVID-19 vaccines include

436

aluminum as part of the adjuvant component7,13,15,16,31-37, often in combination with other

437

immunostimulants, such as CpG, to achieve a balanced immune response. Furthermore, these

438

recombinant protein vaccines, including RBD219-N1C1, might find an additional important use as a

439

booster if one of the newer platform vaccines, e.g., mRNA or adenovirus-based vaccines induce

440

lower than expected immunogenicity or protection. Such prime-boost approaches have been used

441

successfully with the chimp adenovirus vaccine for malaria and other systems, for example38,39.

Yeast-expressed SARS-CoV-2 RBD
442

The selection of the P. pastoris expression platform for the production of the RBD antigen

443

was motivated by the intent to develop a low-cost production process that could easily be transferred

444

to manufacturers in LMICs. Currently, there are several types of COVID-19 vaccine candidates in

445

advanced clinical trials6,40-45. The focus of some of the initiatives behind these vaccines is to provide

446

vaccines for the developed world that might struggle to be successful without advanced

447

infrastructure. Being able to match the existing experience in LMICs with the production of other

448

biologics in yeast increases the probability of successful technology transfer20. For example,

449

currently, the recombinant hepatitis B vaccine is produced in yeast by several members of the

450

Development Country Vaccine Manufacturers Network (DCVMN), and we foresee that, given the

451

existing infrastructure and expertise, those facilities could be repurposed to produce a yeast-produced

452

COVID-19 vaccine46. Recently, the research cell bank and production process for the RBD219-N1C1

453

antigen was technologically transferred to a vaccine manufacturer in India and produced under cGMP

454

conditions with the intent to enter into clinical development. In addition, preclinical studies using the

455

RBD219-WT and RBD219-N1C1 antigens are ongoing to further optimize and evaluate other novel

456

formulations, including a challenge study in a non-human primate model.
