ABSTRACT
The coronavirus main protease, Mpro, is a key protein in the virus life cycle and a major drug target. Based on crystal
structures of SARSCoV2 Mpro complexed with peptidomimetic inhibitors, we recognized a binding characteristic
shared with proline-containing inhibitors of hepatitis C virus protease. Initial tests showed that this subclass of HCV
protease inhibitors indeed exhibited activity against Mpro. Postulating a benefit for a preorganized backbone
conformation, we designed new ketoamide-based Mpro inhibitors based on central proline rings. One of the designed
compounds, ML1000, inhibits Mpro with low-nanomolar affinity and suppresses SARSCoV2 viral replication in
human cells at sub-micromolar concentrations. Our findings identify ML1000 as a promising new pre-organized
scaffold for the development of anti-coronavirus drugs.
INTRODUCTION
In the last two decades, three coronaviruses, SARSCoV1, MERSCoV, and SARSCoV2 have emerged from animal
reservoirs to cause lethal respiratory illnesses in humans (1). In particular, SARSCoV2 has already caused more
than 800,000 deaths (2). For SARSCoV2 and future coronavirus outbreaks, until effective vaccines have been
administered to most of the world’s population, antiviral drugs will be needed to reduce morbidity and death.
Orally available anti-coronavirus drugs would be highly desirable, as they can be given in an outpatient
setting, i.e. without requiring hospitalization. As such they can be given upon diagnosis, which could prevent
progression to more severe or protracted disease and thereby greatly reduce morbidity and mortality. However, the
only antiviral drug with proven efficacy against SARSCoV2, remdesivir, is an intravenous drug that can only be
administered to hospitalized patients. Even then it only reduces disease duration and risk of death by ~30% each
(3). Dexamethasone has proven efficacy in improving survival in late-stage COVID-19 by suppressing the late
hyperinflammatory responses that cause respiratory and organ failure rather than inhibiting viral replication (4).
However, it is ineffective if given earlier (4), and even possibly harmful by inhibiting immune responses directed
against the virus (5–7). Thus, drugs that can effectively suppress coronavirus replication in an outpatient setting
during the entire post-infection period do not exist, but are urgently needed.
Inhibitors of the coronavirus main protease (Mpro), a key protein in the coronavirus life cycle, could be
especially effective as antiviral agents (8, 9). Mpro (also called 3C-like protease due to its homology with enterovirus
3C protease) is a cysteine protease that cleaves the large nonstructural polyprotein of coronavirus into smaller pieces
to assemble the RNA replicase (10). Experimental inhibitors of coronavirus Mpro protect mice and cats from lethal
coronavirus disease, validating Mpro as a medicinal target (11–13).
There is currently intense interest in discovering effective inhibitors for SARSCoV2 Mpro. As coronavirus
Mpro species all share similar substrate specificity profiles (14), previously characterized inhibitors for other
coronaviruses have, unsurprisingly, demonstrated inhibitory activity on SARSCoV2 Mpro as well. For example, the
Michael acceptor compound N3, developed in 2005 as an inhibitor of SARSCoV1 Mpro (15), also inhibits the 96%
identical SARSCoV2 Mpro in vitro (15, 16, 16). A series of ketoamide-based inhibitors developed for SARSCoV1
Mpro were also effective against SARSCoV2 Mpro in vitro (17), and gave rise to the modified SARSCoV2 Mpro
inhibitor 13b (18). Finally, GC376, a broad-spectrum aldehyde prodrug of various coronavirus Mpro species, and
11a, an aldehyde compound designed to inhibit SARSCoV1 Mpro were found to inhibit SARSCoV2 Mpro (19, 20).
However, it is not clear if known coronavirus Mpro inhibitors have the necessary attributes to be safe and
effective oral therapeutics for human coronavirus diseases. In 11a and the active form of GC-376, an

aldehyde reactive group (warhead) reacts with the active site cysteine, but aldehydes are generally considered nonideal drug candidates due to toxicity caused by off-target reactions (21–24). For example, the high reactivity of
aldehyde warheads has been shown to drive non-specific inhibition of cysteine proteases (25). Protease inhibitors
with ketoamide and Michael acceptor warheads can exhibit better specificity, stability, and oral bioavailability than
those with aldehydes (26–29), and examples have progressed to late-stage clinical trials or regulatory approval (30,
31). Compounds 13b and N3 utilize ketoamide and Michael acceptor warheads respectively, but they appear to have
insufficient efficacy to be therapeutically useful. While 13b demonstrates a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) on
Mpro in vitro of 670 nM, the 50% effective concentration (EC50) in blocking SARSCoV2 replication in human cells
is ~4 μM (18). This compares unfavorably to the achieved concentration in mouse lungs of <0.1 μM (18). For N3,
while it demonstrates a low IC50 in vitro, its EC50 for SARSCoV2 replication is 17 μM (16), indicating poor cell
permeability. This is not surprising given its large size (mw 681) and numerous polar groups. Thus, the development
of new Mpro inhibitor designs with low toxicity and low EC50 in cells remains an urgent priority.
Multiple clinically approved protease inhibitors incorporate cyclic structures to improve affinity by preorganizing the inhibitors into a conformation favorable for binding (32). In energetic terms, this is considered paying
the entropic penalty of conformational rigidification prior to binding (33, 34), and cyclization has been
experimentally confirmed to increase protease inhibitor affinity (35). In this study, we explore the ability of a cyclic
moiety to improve the affinity of coronavirus Mpro inhibitors. We developed a novel inhibitor, ML1000, with
molecular weight of 549 Da and IC50 value of 12 nM on SARSCoV2 Mpro. ML1000 inhibits SARSCoV2 replication
in human cells with an EC50 of 0.1 µM, and thus is the highest-potency non-aldehyde Mpro inhibitor reported so far.
ML1000 represents a new structural class of potent ketoamide inhibitors of coronavirus Mpro, and may serve as a
promising starting point for the development of drug candidates against human coronavirus diseases.
RESULTS
While visualizing the co-crystal structure of 13b and SARSCoV2 Mpro (18), we noticed that 13b adopts a
pronounced kink in its main chain at the P2 residue, i.e. the 2nd residue N-terminal to the scissile bond facing the
enzyme’s S2 pocket (Fig. 1A). Due to our previous work with HCV protease and its small-molecule inhibitors (36),
we recognized this kink to be similar to that created by proline analog rings in the clinically approved anti-HCV
drugs boceprevir, narlaprevir, and telaprevir (Fig. 1B-D). Like 13b, these drugs are ketoamide-based covalent
inhibitors, serving as substrates for nucleophilic attack by the deprotonated active-site cysteine.
Manual rigid docking of boceprevir showed that it could fit into the active site of SARSCoV2 Mpro with
good shape complementarity by its P1, P2, and P4 groups (Fig. 1B). In addition, the urea group of boceprevir at the
P3-P4 junction could engage in a bidentate hydrogen bond with the backbone carbonyl of Mpro Glu-166. The
boceprevir derivative narlaprevir also demonstrated complementary in its P1 and P2 groups, which are identical to
boceprevir, but its P4 group was clearly too large for the S4 pocket. Telaprevir could also be manually docked with
good complementarity of its P1 sidechain and of its P2 group, which is a different proline analog from that of
boceprevir (Fig. 1C), whereas its P4 group appeared slightly too large for the S4 pocket. The P3 group of
coronavirus Mpro substrates face out into solution (37), as does the t-butyl group in the analogous position of
boceprevir, telaprevir, and narlaprevir. Interestingly, the φ and ψ angles of the proline ring in boceprevir precisely
retraced the backbone atoms of 13b in the bound configuration (Fig. 1D). We thus hypothesized that boceprevir
and, to a lesser extent, narlaprevir and telaprevir, may be able to inhibit SARSCoV2 Mpro.
To address this hypothesis, we performed a preliminary rapid assessment using a live-cell assay of Mpro
function. We co-expressed SARSCoV2 Mpro and a substrate protein comprising green fluorescent protein (GFP), a
substrate site, and the membrane-targeting CAAX sequence (Fig. 2A). Cleavage at the substrate sequence liberates
GFP, allowing quantitation of activity by immunoblotting. We could then assess the ability of drugs to inhibit Mpro
activity in cells. In HEK293A cells, we found boceprevir and telaprevir to inhibit SARSCoV2 Mpro at micromolar
concentrations (Fig. 2B). These results provided evidence of the ability of HCV inhibitors with a P2 proline group
to inhibit SARSCoV2 Mpro.
We next performed a pilot test of the ability of HCV inhibitors with a P2 proline group to inhibit
SARSCoV2 Mpro in vitro (Fig. 3A). As controls, we also tested GC-376 as a known broad-spectrum coronavirus
Mpro inhibitor, ebselen and disulfiram as compounds recently reported to inhibit SARSCoV2 Mpro (16), and ritonavir
as a protease inhibitor without any structural homology to coronavirus Mpro substrates. Indeed, we observed that

Figure 3. Inhibition of SARSCoV2 Mpro activity in vitro. (A) Left, relative Mpro activity in the presence of 2 mM
DTT and 150 µM of drugs. GC-376 showed the most inhibition, followed by boceprevir, then telaprevir and
narlaprevir. The HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, ebselen, and disulfiram showed less than 50% inhibiting of
enzyme activity, indicating IC50 > 150 µM in reducing conditions. Right, in the absence of DTT, ebselen and
disulfiram showed efficient inhibition of Mpro activity. Enzymatic assays were carried out with 100 nM purified
SARSCoV2 Mpro with an uncleaved C-terminal His6-tag, Mpro-His6 (B) IC50 measurements by inhibitor titrations on
100 nM SARSCoV2 Mpro-His6 (top) or 100 nM fully mature SARSCoV2 Mpro (bottom). For ebselen and disulfram,
measurements were performed in the absence of DTT, while the assay buffer contained 2 mM DTT for all other
drugs. Mean values of 2 to 3 independent experiments are shown. Error bars represent standard deviation.

boceprevir, narlaprevir, telaprevir, GC-376, disulfiram, and ebselen (at 150 μM concentration in air-equilibrated
buffer) were able to inhibit SARSCoV2 Mpro, whereas ritonavir showed no inhibitory effect (Fig. 3A). Incidentally,
disulfiram and ebselen showed no inhibitory effect in the presence of DTT, whereas other compounds were
unaffected by DTT. These results are consistent with proposals of disulfiram and ebselen forming a reducible bond
with Mpro (38). As the interior of the cell is reducing, reduction of ebselen adducts could contribute to its relatively
high EC50 of 4.7 μM for blocking SARSCoV2 replication in cells (16).
We then performed full inhibition curves SARSCoV2 Mpro to obtain IC50 values for the above compounds.
The initial pilot test above was performed with SARSCoV2 Mpro with a C-terminal His6-tag for rapid purification,
but the presence of a C-terminal extension may have an inhibitory effect on protease activity (39, 40). We thus
performed inhibition curves on both C-terminally extended and fully mature SARSCoV2 Mpro (Fig. 3B). We tested
drugs in the presence of DTT, except for ebselen and disulfiram, for which we omitted DTT. Our results showed
that the proline-containing HCV protease inhibitors boceprevir, telaprevir, and narlaprevir all could inhibit activity
to some extent in both C-terminally extended and fully mature forms of SARSCoV2 Mpro. Among these, boceprevir
was the most potent, with an IC50 value of 4.1 μM on mature SARSCoV2 Mpro (Fig. 3B, Table 1).
Having established that the P2 proline analogues in boceprevir, telaprevir, and narlaprevir were compatible
with binding to the SARSCoV2 Mpro active site, we next sought to design next-generation coronavirus inhibitors
that could combine the entropic stabilization conferred by these P2 rings with side groups optimized for coronavirus
Mpro binding. A P1 Gln residue is strongly preferred by all coronavirus Mpro species (14). In fact, this preference is
conserved with the related enterovirus 3C proteases such as human rhinovirus (HRV) protease and even with the
more distantly related potyvirus proteases such as tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (41, 42). Beginning with the
HRV protease inhibitors AG7088 (rupintrivir) and its derivative AG7404 (43, 44), enterovirus and coronavirus
protease inhibitors have incorporated a γ-lactam group to mimic the hydrogen bond acceptor function of Gln in the
P1 position. Enzyme-inhibitor cocrystal structures have confirmed that the γ-lactam amide group is positioned
similarly to the Gln amide group in natural structures (37, 45). We thus designed a novel inhibitor, ML1000, with
the ketoamide warhead of boceprevir, the γ-lactamyl P1 group of rupintrivir, and the P2 through P4 moieties
(including backbone and side chains) of boceprevir (Fig. 4A). We also designed a second inhibitor, ML1100,
composed of the ketoamide warhead of boceprevir, the γ-lactamyl P1 group of rupintrivir, the P2 cyclic structure
of telaprevir, and the P3 and P4 moieties of boceprevir (Fig. 4A). We retained the P3 and P4 structure of boceprevir
as these groups did not demonstrate any clashes with the enzyme pocket in the manually docked boceprevir model,
and as their hydrophobicity likely contributes to membrane permeability.
ML1000 and ML1100 proved to be highly potent inhibitors of SARSCoV2 Mpro. In the presence of 100 nM
of enzyme, ML1000 and ML1100 produced IC50 values of 34 nM and 147 nM (Fig. 4B, Table 1), compared to 54
nM for GC-376 (Fig. 3B, Table 1). Against the Mpro enzyme from the distantly related coronavirus mouse hepatitis
virus (MHV), ML1000 and ML1100 exhibited IC50 values of 130 and 301 nM, respectively, compared to 67 nM
for GC-376 (Table 1, Supporting Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that ketoamide inhibitors with proline ring
analogs at the P2 position can function as broad-spectrum coronavirus Mpro inhibitors with potency approaching
that of aldehyde inhibitors.
We noted that the measured IC50 values of ML1000 and GC-376 for SARSCoV2 Mpro were within
experimental error of the theoretical limit of half of the enzyme concentration in the assay (46), hindering the ability
to discern differences in potency between them. We thus also measured IC50 values at a lower SARSCoV2 Mpro
concentration of 20 nM (Fig. 4C). In these conditions, ML1000 and GC-376 still demonstrated comparable IC50
values of 12 and 14 nM, respectively, below the concentration of Mpro (i.e. the tight binding limit). Physiological
temperature, compared to the 30 °C at which these assays are usually performed, could potentially increase
structural flexibility and alter drug affinity of Mpro. However, we found no significant difference in potency between
37 °C and 30 °C for each inhibitor (Table 1, Supporting Fig. 2). These results indicate that ML1000 has high
potency in vitro and represents the tightest-binding non-aldehyde SARSCoV2 Mpro inhibitor discovered so far.
Next, we tested the efficacy of the new inhibitors against SARSCoV2 Mpro in human Huh7 cells by
measuring the extent of cleavage of coexpressed substrate (Fig. 5). Here, we observed the rank order of effectivenss
to be GC-376 > ML1000 > ML1100 > boceprevir (Fig. 5). It should be emphasized that this assay does not directly
measure the fraction of active Mpro. If a small fraction of active Mpro is sufficient to result in substrate cleavage, this
would effectively increase the measured concentration needed to suppress protease activity. However, the assay
does provide an assessment of the relative ability of a set of drugs to cross the cellular membrane and inhibit Mpro
within living cells.

of ML1000 and ML1100 with 100 nM mature SARSCoV2 Mpro. With enzyme concentration at 100 nM, the lowest

were 12 and 14 nM, respectively. Thus, ML1000 and GC-376 shows tight binding, even at 20 nM of Mpro, and the
IC50 values may still be limited by the enzyme concentration. Mean values of 3 independent experiments are shown.

Finally, we tested the ability of ML1000 and ML1100 to inhibit SARSCoV2 virus replication in Caco-2
human intestinal cells. For comparison, we tested boceprevir and GC-376. Boceprevir inhibited viral replication
with an EC50 of 0.2 µM, while GC-376 was even more potent, with a remarkably low EC50 of 0.1 nM (Table 2, Fig.
6). ML1000 and ML1100 inhibited SARSCoV2 replication with EC50 values of 0.1 and 0.2 µM, respectively (Table
2, Fig. 6). While the enhancement in anti-viral efficacy of ML1000 relative to boceprevir is not as large as the
enhancement in enzyme inhibition observed in vitro (Table 1), the EC50 value of ML1000 is nevertheless the lowest
reported to date for any non-aldehyde inhibitors of SARSCoV2 Mpro. In addition, ML1000 and ML1100 exhibited
no cytotoxicity at the highest dose tested of 100 μM in Caco-2 cells and Huh-7 cells (Table 2, Supporting Fig. 3),
resulting in selectivity indices of >1000 and >500 respectively. These results confirm that ML1000 is a potent and
selective ketoamide inhibitor of SARSCoV2 replication.
DISCUSSION
There is strong interest in discovering non-aldehyde inhibitors of SARSCoV2 Mpro with the potential for
oral administration. In this study, we developed ML1000 as a ketoamide inhibitor that is more potent against
SARSCoV2 replication than previously described ketoamide or Michael acceptor compounds (9). Although its
safety profile remains to be determined, ML1000 was designed to minimize toxicity by using only chemical motifs
from drugs with established safety records in humans. Likewise, ML1000 was designed with the potential for oral
dosing in mind. ML1000 is essentially the approved drug boceprevir with its P2 group altered to that of AG-7404.
Of note, both boceprevir and AG-7404 have been proven to have high oral bioavailability and to be safe in humans
(44, 47). In particular, boceprevir is taken 3 times daily for over 300 consecutive days on an outpatient basis (47).
Our findings that GC376 potently inhibits SARSCoV2 replication in Caco-2 cells adds to other recent data
supporting its potential utility for treating COVID-19 (20, 48, 49). However, GC376 may be better suited for
intravenous administration than oral dosing, given its short in vivo half-life and low oral bioavailability (12, 27). In
addition, the presence of off-target effects, evidenced by suppression of tooth eruption in GC376-treated cats (13),
suggests the need to develop additional classes of protease inhibitors.
In the course of our study, three other groups reported that boceprevir can inhibit SARSCoV2 Mpro at low
micromolar concentrations in vitro (48–50). Two of these studies included crystal structures of SARSCoV2 Mpro
complexed with boceprevir (PDB 6WNP and 7C6S) that validate our manually docked model (49, 50). Alignment
of these structures to that of 13b complexed with SARSCoV2 Mpro indicates that the proline ring of boceprevir can
indeed mimic a turn taken by the backbone of linear protease inhibitors at the P2 position (Supporting Fig 4),
confirming our original hypothesis (Fig. 1). Two of the studies also demonstrated that boceprevir suppresses
SARSCoV2 viral replication in monkey cells with EC50 values between 2 and 16 µM (48, 50).
Our work demonstrates the unexpected favorability of incorporating proline-like rings into coronavirus
protease inhibitors, specifically at the P2-analogous position. This finding is unexpected because proline is never
found at this position in coronavirus Mpro substrates (14). One explanation could be that proline itself naturally lacks
the bulk to fully occupy the deep S2 pocket, which prefers long aliphatic side chains such as leucine and
phenylalanine. Thus, the proline analogs of boceprevir and telaprevir, which have a bicyclic structure, not only lock
the backbone of the inhibitor into its bound conformation, but through their large bulk also fill the S2 pocket.
The ability of ML1000 and its structural variant ML1100 to bind to SARSCoV2 Mpro more effectively than
larger compounds with the same ketoamide warhead (17) suggests that introduction of a cyclic structure can be a
chemically parsimonious method to improve molecular recognition. The pre-rigidification of an inhibitor using a
cyclic structure may provide enhanced affinity compared to a non-cyclic structure of the same size through
prepayment of the entropic penalty of binding, and therefore can be an efficient strategy for potency improvement.
One parameter for potential further improvement of ML1000 is cell permeability. The conversion of the
cyclobutyl group in the P1 position of boceprevir to the γ-lactamyl group in ML1000 adds an additional hydrogen
bond acceptor and donor, which would be expected to decrease cell permeability. While ML1000 is ~340-fold more
potent on enzyme inhibition than boceprevir in vitro, it is only ~2-fold more effective on viral suppression in Caco2 cells. We speculate that improving the permeability of ML1000 would further enhance antiviral efficacy in cells.
In summary, ML1000 can be considered an example of a new class of coronavirus Mpro inhibitors that
feature a cyclic P2 group, high affinity, and solubility. Taken together, our results suggest that ML1000 is a
promising scaffold for the development of anti-coronavirus drugs, and additional structures incorporating proline
ring analogues can be explored as coronavirus Mpro inhibitors.

METHODS
Inhibitors
ML1000 and ML1100 were synthesized under fee-for-service agreements by ACME Bioscience (Palo Alto,
CA, USA), and Chempartner (Shanghai, China), respectively. All other inhibitors were readily available: boceprevir
(Cayman Chemical, ≥ 98%), narlaprevir (AdooQ, ≥ 98%), telaprevir (AdooQ Bioscience, ≥ 98%), GC-376
(AOBIOUS, ≥ 98%), ebselen (Cayman Chemical, ≥ 99%), disulfiram (LKT Laboratories, ≥ 98%), ritonavir (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, ≥ 98%).
Cell-based Mpro Activity Assay in HEK293A and Huh7
Cell culture and transfection. HEK293A and HEK293FT cells were cultured at 37 ºC in 5% CO2 in
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/mL penicillin and
100 μg/mL streptomycin. Huh7 cells were cultured at 37 ºC in 5% CO2 in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640
medium (RPMI 1640, Life Technoloiges) supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL
streptomycin.
Mpro activity assay in HEK293A. Cells were transfected with a pcDNA3.1/Puro-CAG plasmid containing
the construct shown in Fig. 2A using Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies) in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Telaprevir and boceprevir were added 2 h post-transfection. 24 h posttransfection, cells were washed twice with PBS, then lysed with 50 μL hot LDS lysis buffer (50% 4x LDS Sample
Buffer (NuPAGE, Life Technologies), 10% 2-mercaptoethanol), and DNA was sheared by sonication. After heating
at 80-90 °C for 1-2 minutes, cell lysates were loaded onto 4%-12% or 12% Bis-Tris gels (NuPAGE, Life
Technologies) along with a Precision Plus protein dual-color standard (Bio-Rad). Protein bands were transferred to
PVDF membranes using a Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad) and blocked with SuperBlock T20 (TBS)
Blocking Buffer (Thermo Scientific). Membranes were probed with primary antibodies in SuperBlock T20 (TBS)
Blocking Buffer and fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies in SuperBlock (TBS) Blocking Buffer (Thermo
Scientific), with 3 washes in SuperBlock T20 (TBS) Blocking Buffer after each step. Membranes were imaged
using an Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR). Western blots were quantified using ImageJ. The following primary
antibodies were used for immunoblotting at the indicated dilutions: mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma-Aldrich,
F1804), 1:2000; rabbit polyclonal anti-beta Actin (Abcam, ab8227), 1:5000. Secondary antibodies were LI-COR
680RD goat-anti-rabbit and 800CW goat-anti-mouse, used at 1:5000 dilution each.
Mpro activity assay in Huh7. Lentiviruses were produced by transfecting HEK293FT cells with pLL3.7
plasmids containing the construct shown in Fig. 2A or a version with a catalytically dead Mpro C145A mutation and
two helper plasmids (psPAX2, MD2G). Transfection was carried out with CalPhosTM Mammalian Transfection
Kit (Takara Bio) at a ratio of pLL3.7:psPAX2:MD2G = 20:15:6. The virus-containing supernatant was harvested
48 or 72 hours post transfection. Cell debris was removed with a 5 min 2000 g centrifugation, followed by a 0.45 μm
filtration (Millipore). Virus titer was determined using Lenti-XTM GoStixTM Plus (Takara Bio), and Huh7 cells
were infected at a MOI of 5. Drugs were added 24 hours post infection and cells were lysed and prepared for western
blotting, as described above, 4 days post infection.

Mpro Expression and Purification
Modified versions of previous protocols based on HRV protease (40) or SUMO protease (51) processing
of Mpro fusion proteins were used to obtain purified Mpro with either native or extended termini after expression in
E. coli. Specifically, Mpro variants were cloned either as a GST-Mpro-His6 or His6-SUMO-Mpro fusion into a pET
vector (Addgene plasmid #29666) using synthetic gene blocks for the Mpro portion of the SARS-CoV2 polyprotein
(pp1ab residue 3264-3569) or the MHV1 polyprotein (pp1ab 3314-3624). The constructs are listed in Supporting
Fig. 5. In general, the His6-SUMO-Mpro fusions produced higher yields of soluble protein compared to the GSTMpro-His6 constructs. This is likely due to toxicity and growth retardation associated with Mpro activation upon
autocatalytic removal of the GST-tag during expression of the GST-Mpro-His6 fusion. In contrast, the His6-SUMOMpro fusion is produced in full-length and only becomes fully active after SUMO-tag removal during subsequent
purification steps.
For SARSCoV2 Mpro variants, the plasmids were transformed into T7 Express lysY/Iq Competent E. coli
(NEB). All cultures were grown in 2×YT media. Overnight cultures were used to inoculate larger cultures that were
grown at 37 °C to OD600 ~ 0.8 before induction with 0.5 mM IPTG. After induction and 4-5 h growth at 24 °C, the
cells were harvested, and the pellets were frozen. Chemical lysis of the resuspended pellets was performed in BPER
(Thermo Fisher) supplemented with 20 U/mL Pierce universal nuclease (ThermoFisher Scientific), and the
supernatant cleared by 15 min of centrifugation at 15000 g. The soluble fraction was batch absorbed onto INDIGONi resin (Cube Biotech) in a buffer with imidazole and NaCl added to 10 mM and 200 mM, respectively. The resin
was loaded onto gravity flow columns and washed with 20 column volumes of wash buffer containing 50 mM Tris
(pH 8), 25 mM Imidazole, and 300 mM NaCl. High purity protein was eluted in a buffer of 50 mM Tris (pH 8), 250
mM Imidazole, and 300 mM NaCl. Eluted fractions with high protein content were pooled and buffer exchanged
into HRV protease cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 7.3), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) or SUMO protease cleavage
buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT). The proteins were cleaved by incubation with 1.5 % (w/w)
His-tagged HRV-3C protease (Millipore Sigma SAE0045) or 15 U/mg His-tagged SUMO protease (Millipore
Sigma SAE0067) by overnight incubation at 4 °C. The fully processed Mpro variants were then purified using reverse
affinity chromatography to remove the His-tagged HRV and SUMO proteases and the cleaved His6-tagged fusiondomains/peptides. Purity of the samples was checked on SDS-PAGE, and protein concentrations were determined
based on A280 and predicted extinction coefficients.
For MHV Mpro, expression from construct IV (Supporting Fig. 5) did not result in acceptable yields of
pro
M -His6. Furthermore, we found that the expression of construct V and VI could be dramatically improved by
adding 10 mM DTT to the lysis, wash, and elution buffers described above. All other steps and conditions were
unchanged from the protocol described above for SARSCoV2 Mpro.
In-Vitro Mpro Inhibition Assays
The proteolytic activity of purified Mpro was primarily measured using a fluorogenic peptide, Covidyte
IF670 (AAT Bioquest), that includes a far-red fluorophore iFluor™ 670 and a quencher Tide Quencher™ 5, TQ5.
Upon cleavage of the iFluor-VNSTLQ/SGLRK(TQ5)M peptide by Mpro, energy transfer to the quencher decreases
and the fluorescence intensity of iFluor increases. A well-plate reader (Tecan, Safire 2) was used to monitor the
fluorescence with excitation at 640/20 nm and emission at 680/20 nm. All measurements were performed as bottomreads from lid-covered black 96 well plates with clear bottoms. The in-vitro Mpro activity was measured in an assay
buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris (pH 7.3), 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, and 1-2% DMSO. In specific
experiment DTT was omitted from the buffer.
For the majority of IC50 measurements, 100 nM Mpro was preincubated with varying concentrations of
inhibitor for 30 min at 30 °C. Next, the substrate was added to a final concentration of 2 µM and a final volume of
90 µL. The well-plate was immediately inserted into the plate reader, that had been preheated to 30 °C, and the
fluorescence intensity was monitored at 30 s intervals for 45 min. For selected experiments, the measurements were
performed at 37 °C instead of 30 °C. For GC-376 and ML1000, IC50 values were also quantified at a lower Mpro
concentration of 20 nM in attempt to escape the tight binding regime (Supporting Fig. 6C). For these experiments,
a substrate with faster reaction rate, Covidyte TF670 (AAT Bioquest), was used to counteract the reduced Mpro
activity and increase the sensitivity of the assay. This substrate consists of a far-red fluorophore Tide Fluor™ 5,
TF5, and the TQ5 quencher linked by a peptide substrate, TF5-KTSAVLQ/SGFRKME(TQ5)M.
The rate of substrate cleavage was extracted by linear fitting of the fluorescence signal increase as a function
of time (Supporting Fig. 6). The IC50 curves were evaluated using the following equation in Prism (GraphPad):

Here vrel is the experimentally measured rate of substrate cleavage normalized to the rate of substrate cleavage in
the absence of inhibitor, I. The maximal and minimal rate of substrate cleavage in each experiment, vmax and vmin,
respectively, the Hill coefficient, n, and IC50 are all fitting parameters in the non-linear fitting routine.
Cytotoxicity assay in Huh7 cells
24 h prior to the drug treatment, 10000 Huh7 cells were seeded in 100 µl culture medium (DMEM with 10%
FBS, 2mM L-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin) in a 96-well white microplate (Greiner Bio-One, Austria) precoated with poly-D-lysine (10µg/ml, Sigma). The next day, the culture medium was replaced with assay medium
(DMEM with 5% FBS, 2mM L-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, 1 % DMSO) containing inhibitors at the desired
concentration (1 -100 µM). Staurosporine, a non-selective protein kinase inhibitor known to induce apoptosis, was
used as a positive control (0.01 µM - 1 µM). After 48 h, cell viability was determined using the CellTiter-Glo 2.0
kit (Promega, USA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The bioluminescence signal was measured
on a multi-mode microplate reader (Tecan, Safire 2).
Antiviral and cytotoxicity assays in Caco-2 cells
The tested Mpro inhibitors were serially diluted from 10 mM DMSO stocks using eight log10 dilutions in
test medium (MEM supplemented with 2% FBS and 50 µg/mL gentamicin) yielding a concentration range of 10
pM – 100 µM. Each dilution was added to 5 wells of a 96-well plate with 80-100% confluent Caco-2 cells. Three
wells of each dilution were infected with virus, and two wells remained uninfected as toxicity controls. Six wells
were infected and untreated as virus controls, and six wells were uninfected and untreated as cell controls.
SARSCoV2 (USA_WA1/2020 strain passaged twice in Vero 76 cells in MEM supplemented with 2% fetal bovine
serum and 50 µg/ml gentamicin to prepare a working stock) was prepared at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) that
would yield measurable virus titers within 72 hours. Plates were incubated at 37±2 °C and 5% CO2.
For virus yield reduction assays, the supernatant fluid from each condition was collected on day 3 postinfection (3 wells pooled) and tested for virus titer using an endpoint dilution in Vero 76 cells. The virus titer was
determined by visual observation of cells under a light microscope on day 5 post-infection. Viral titers, VT, were
quantified on a logarithm scale in the form of CCID50/mL using the Reed Muench equation. The data was fitted to
the following equation:
>?,-. />?,01
𝑉𝑇 = 𝑉𝑇&'( + 34([6]/>?
)
,0@

The 50% effective concentration, EC50, was defined as the concentration of inhibitor were VT reaches VTmax -log2
and extracted from the fitted curves.
Drug cytotoxicity was also assayed on day 3 in a neutral red viability assay. Plates were stained with dye
for 2 hours (±15 minutes). Supernatant dye was removed, wells rinsed with PBS, and the incorporated dye extracted
in 50:50 Sørensen citrate buffer/ethanol for >30 minutes before measuring the optical density at 540 nm, OD540.
OD540 was used to calculate the relative viability to non-exposed cell controls.
Significant hazards
No unexpected or unusually high safety hazards were encountered.
