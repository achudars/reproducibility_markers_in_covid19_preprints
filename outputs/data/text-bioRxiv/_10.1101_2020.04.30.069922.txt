Abstract:
There is an urgent need for specific antiviral drugs directed against SARS-CoV-2 both to prevent the most
severe forms of COVID-19 and to reduce viral excretion and subsequent virus dissemination; in the present
pandemic context, drug repurposing is a priority. Targeting the nucleoprotein N of the SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus in order to inhibit its association with viral RNA could be a strategy to impeding viral replication
and possibly other essential functions associated with viral N. The antiviral properties of naproxen,
belonging to the NSAID family, previously demonstrated against Influenza A virus, were evaluated against
SARS-CoV-2. Naproxen binding to the nucleoprotein of SARS-CoV2 was shown by molecular modeling. In
VeroE6 cells and reconstituted human primary respiratory epithelium models of SARS-CoV-2 infection,
naproxen inhibited viral replication and protected the bronchial epithelia against SARS-CoV-2 induceddamage. The benefit of naproxen addition to the standard of care is tested in an on-going clinical study.

Keywords: Antiviral, drug repurposing, SARS-CoV-2, Influenza, structure-based drug design,

The current pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019 1,2. As of
April 22, 2020, there have been more than 2 475 723 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 169 151
deaths in 213 countries, reported to WHO (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novelcoronavirus-2019). SARS-CoV-2 is a beta-coronavirus closely related to the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV),
that emerged in 2003 and 2012, respectively. These viruses are also transmitted from animals to humans
and cause severe respiratory diseases in afflicted individuals.
There is an urgent need for specific and effective antiviral drugs directed against pandemic SARS-CoV-2
to prevent the most severe forms of COVID-19. In that context, drug repurposing is a priority. Ongoing
advances in our knowledge of this new virus and its pathogenesis are revealing an exacerbated
inflammatory response in severe COVID-19 cases, with a similar cytokine storm observed in severe cases
of H5N1 Influenza virus infection and 1918 Influenza A pandemics3. In that regard, the symptoms of
respiratory distress caused by COVID-19 could be reduced by drugs combining anti-inflammatory and
antiviral effects4.
Several current therapeutic approaches involve drug repositioning, in light of what has been achieved for
other viruses, particularly influenza viruses5. Our previous work showed that naproxen, an approved antiinflammatory drug, is an inhibitor of both cyclooxygenase (COX) and of Influenza A virus nucleoprotein 6.
Although NSAIDs were the subject of a precautionary measure by the French Ministry of Health in midMarch 2020 regarding the use of these drugs in the event of COVID-19 infection, there is currently no
evidence of any particular toxicity of this family of drugs 7-8. Moreover, the ability of naproxen to decrease
viral load and inflammation through the inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity could be beneficial for limiting
the cytokine storm that may happen in severe forms of COVID19. Importantly, naproxen has the advantage
of being a generic drug, readily available and often used for other indications than COVID-19 by fragile
populations.
Naproxen binding to the Influenza A virus nucleoprotein blocked viral RNA association with the
nucleoprotein and impeded its self-association

6, 9

; consequently, naproxen strongly reduced viral

transcription/ replication in infected cells and protected mice against an infection with Influenza A virus 6,
10

. Viral nucleoproteins are unique to the virus and no equivalent of these proteins are found in the host

cell, which makes them attractive targets for potential antivirals 12-13. Moreover, the viral nucleoprotein is
an important diagnostic marker of infection with SARS-COV and /or Influenza A 14-15. SARS-CoV-1 virions
contains multiple copies of the N protein (ca 1000 copies) located inside the particle, thus N is one of the

most abundant structural proteins in CoVs 16. Through its interaction with the coronavirus membrane (M)
protein, the N protein drives virus assembly and budding. N binds to the long viral RNA genome to form a
virion core comprising a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that assumes a long helical structure. The RNP is
important for replication and transcription in which the N protein also plays a critical role. Interactions
between N and the non-structural protein-3 are also important for replication. In addition to its role in
different aspects of the viral cycle, the N protein not only highjacks cellular processes, including the
progression of the host cell cycle and apoptosis, but also modulates the immune response, by for example
inhibiting the interferon response17.
In this study, we combined structure-based modeling of naproxen binding to the nucleoprotein of SARSCoV-2 with experimental approaches to explore and validate whether naproxen harbors antiviral activity
against SARS-CoV-2 pandemic virus, as previously implemented for Influenza A virus9-10, 18.

Structure-based modeling of naproxen binding to the nucleoprotein of SARS-CoV-2: The nucleoproteins
N of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded viruses Coronavirus (CoV) share with negative-sense singlestranded viruses such as Influenza A virus the ability to bind to- and protect genomic viral RNA without
sequence specificity and to form self-associated oligomers 12-13, 18-19. Despite the limited sequence similarity
between them, the N-terminal domains of three coronaviruses SARS- Cov-1, MERS- CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and
Influenza A virus all presented a wide, positively-charged groove in which the viral negatively-charged RNA
binds, Figure 1 (A-D)20-21,13. The coronavirus N proteins present a central antiparallel sheet of 3-5 β-strands
structure and flexible linkers and loops, with emphasis on the large extrusion carrying many basic residues,
which likely helps adjust binding to the RNA. Such flexibility 22 was evaluated here from the crystallographic
b factor (Figure 1 E-H). The central parts of the  -sheet of these CoV proteins concentrate most of the
aromatic residues (Figure 1I). For instance, SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein amino-terminal domain counts 14
aromatic residues among a total of 124 modeled in 6VYO.pdb. The consecutive, 5-aromatics pentapeptide
108

WYFYY112 is located at the center of the electropositive groove (Figure 1I, red arrow). This contrast with

the nucleoprotein of Influenza A virus which has a single aromatic residue (Y148) within its RNA binding
groove in which naproxen (Figure 1J) was shown to bind, making electrostatic (blue arrow) and hydrophobic
interactions (red arrow) with conserved residues of the RNA binding groove and C-terminal domain (Sup.
Figure 1)6 . From these observations, we could expect that the N-terminal domain of CoVs N may offer
more than a single binding site for naproxen, which could concentrate within the cluster of aromatic
residues found in the middle of the -sheet. This is exactly what is observed in SARS-CoV-1 (Figure 1K, N
and supplementary Figure 1C-K). The recently published structure of MERS-CoV N terminal domain and the

SARS-Cov-2 N-terminal domain were crystallized as a dimer of dimer, which offers a potential site for
naproxen at the interface of the dimer 13 in addition to a binding site on one monomer of the protein. These
two sites are shown in Sup. Figure 1E, F. Naproxen stabilized this “non -natural” interface as found in the
crystal structure for the designed ligands by Hou et al13. Figures 1L, O and M, P and Sup. Figure 1H, E indeed
show that naproxen can also bind at this interface in both MERS-CoV and SARS-Cov-2, respectively, but an
additional binding site in SARS-CoV-2 monomer was also identified (Sup. Figure 1F). Supplementary Figure
1A -D shows that naproxen binds at the interface between hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts of N proteins,
to account for the hydrophobic interactions of its aromatic core with usually aromatic residues ( - stacking)
and methyl group of the methoxy group with hydrophobic apolar residues and polar and/or electrostatic
interactions via its carboxylate moiety. Accordingly, the following order of free binding energies of
naproxen binding to the N-terminal domain of N were calculated: SARS-CoV-1 (G= -30 Kcal/mol) ≈MERSCoV (G= -29 Kcal/mol) ≈ SARS-Cov-2 (G= -26 to - 32) Kcal/mol for site 1 and 2, respectively. This suggests
a similar affinity of naproxen for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, similar or slightly lower affinities of naproxen
for SARS-CoV-2 than naproxen affinity for Influenza A virus based on a free energy calculation of (G= -30
Kcal/mol). Taking together, this work suggests naproxen binding in the N-terminal domains of SARS-CoV-2
N protein and likely to the SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV N in similar binding modes. It is likely that this binding
would impede viral RNA binding to N as naproxen binding sites on the N-terminal domain of N are found in
the RNA binding groove. Competing with N binding to RNA would repress replication and decrease the level
of RNA produced by the virus. The experimental quantification of the viral RNA by RT-qPCR tests this
hypothesis in the below antiviral assays.

Naproxen inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in VeroE6 cells and in reconstituted human airway epithelia
(HAE): Based on the docking analysis described above, we then evaluated the potential anti SARS-CoV-2
activity of naproxen in vitro. As shown in Figure 2A-B, naproxen efficiently reduces viral replication in African
green monkey VeroE6 cells in a dose-response manner. A unique treatment at 1hour post-infection (hpi)
resulted in 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 46.07 µM at 48 hpi and 59.53 µM at 72 hpi. We
determined a cytotoxic concentration CC50 > 1000 µM. This value compares well with the CC50 previously
determined in MDCK and A549 cells to be 1605 ± 300 µM6. The selectivity index (SI) was SI= CC50/IC50, SI
> 21.71 and 19.79, respectively.
We further evaluated the antiviral effect of naproxen using a more biologically relevant experimental
model, notably the nasal and bronchial MucilAirTM reconstituted human airway epithelia (HAE)23.

Developed from biopsies of nasal or bronchial cells differentiated in the air/liquid interphase, these models
reproduce with high fidelity most of the main structural, functional and innate immune features of the
human respiratory epithelium that play a central role in the early stages of infection and constitute robust
surrogates to study airway disease mechanisms and for drug discovery23. Post-infection treatment of nasal
HAE with 90 or 300 µM naproxen did not show an antiviral effect at 48 hpi compared to the mock-treated
control (Fig. 2C, upper panel).
Conversely, significant reductions in intracellular SARS-CoV-2 viral titers were observed for the two
treatment conditions in bronchial HAE (73 and 82% reduction vs mock-treated control, respectively). This
reduction in viral titers correlated with naproxen inducing a protective effect of the bronchial epithelium
integrity, as shown by Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER), considered as a surrogate of epithelium
integrity. TEER values in both naproxen groups were comparable to those of the uninfected and untreated
control (Fig. 2C, lower panel) and significantly higher than those of the untreated control (Fig. 2C, lower
panel). The antiviral effects of naproxen in reconstituted human bronchial epithelium are consistent with
the IC50 value determined in Vero E6 cells. However, the lack of antiviral effect of naproxen on nasal
epithelium is puzzling. The viral load is usually lower in the nasal cavity as compared to the lungs 16, 24. The
nasal epithelium is an important portal for initial infection, and may serve as a key reservoir for viral spread
across the respiratory mucosa and an important locus mediating viral transmission. The number of host
cells as pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages permissive to viral entry is higher in the lungs than the
mucous cells in the nasal cavity. Moreover, recent interactome analysis support the hypothesis that SARSCoV-2 preferentially hijacks host proteins available in lung tissue, and N targets stress granule protein
G3BP1, an essential antiviral protein which is known to induce innate immune response 7.
Interestingly, we previously determined that the peak of viral replication was reached earlier in bronchial
(48-72 hpi) than in nasal HAE, in which a progressive increase in infectious viral titers was observed until at
least 96 hpi23. Using this model, this differential antiviral effect between airway sites was observed for
naproxen in this work and for remdesivir in a recent report that indicates an antiviral effect mainly observed
in the lower respiratory tract of non-Human primates23. It is interesting to note that naproxen is found very
protective against viral-induced damages at 48 h post-infection in the reconstituted bronchial epithelium
(Figure 2C and Figure 4 in 23). Therefore, we speculate that the lack of naproxen effect in nasal epithelium
as opposed to its antiviral effect in pulmonary epithelium could be associated with differential expression
or activity of host factor(s), and/or with slower replication kinetics in the nasal vs pulmonary epithelia.
FAD-approved drugs including nitazoxanide, chloroquine and remdesivir exhibited IC50s in the low
micromolar range against a clinical isolate of COVID-2019 in vitro25. Their corresponding selectivity index

were 17, 129 and 89, respectively and CC50 values found to be 36 µM and in the > 100 µM range. Here,
the selectivity index determined for naproxen for SARS-CoV-2 in VeroE6 cells is SI > (19 ± 3) µM.
The IC50 of naproxen for SARS-CoV2 compares well to IC50 = (25 ± 7) µM and SI = 64 of naproxen
determined for Influenza A at the same MOI = 10-2. These values are consistent with the determination of
the free energies of naproxen binding to N. We cannot exclude additional putative naproxen binding sites
of naproxen in the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV2 or in the unstructured serine-rich domain that could
enable naproxen to further interfere with N functions. In addition to the antiviral activity against SARS-CoV2 virus demonstrated here, naproxen also exhibited antiviral properties in cellular and rodent models of
Influenza A and B 6, 10, 26. Naproxen also inhibited the replication of the unrelated Zika virus 27. Therefore,
from three unrelated single-stranded RNA virus, we suggest that naproxen could present broad-spectrum
antiviral properties. Moreover, the combination of clarithromycin, naproxen and oseltamivir reduced
mortality of patients hospitalized for H3N2 Influenza infection when compared to oseltamivir alone in a
phase IIB/III clinical trial 11.

Conclusion:
We suggest in this study that one of the NSAIDs, naproxen, has a direct antiviral activity on SARS-CoV2 by
its effect on the nucleoprotein-mediated replication and possibly via other functions of N, as inhibition of
interferon17. Indeed, the cellular assays demonstrated subsequent inhibition of viral replication by
naproxen, with recovery of intact pulmonary epithelium protected from the pandemic virus. These very
encouraging results prompted us to test in a clinical trial, named ENACOVID, the effect of addition of
naproxen on the standard of care in severely-ill patients. This trial is supported by APHP, Assistance
Publique, Hôpitaux de Paris areas and deposited on March 26, https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctrsearch/search?query=eudract_number:2020-001301-23.

Supplementary methods
Modeling: The binding mode of naproxen for the protein structures was assessed in a two-step
protocol. First, the binding site was defined by blind docking to the whole protein using the docking
program AutoDock Vina 34. The docking space was defined visually in order to encompass the proteic model
with a 2 Å margin at least as a tetragonal box. Three replicas with the default scoring function Vina 29 were
performed to check the convergence of the experiment. The relevance of the binding sites identified by
blind docking was confirmed by the cavity detection algorithm of Discovery Studio version 2020, which
detected similar sites. A site-docking was then performed using Libdock with energy minimization using
smart minimizer (Discovery Studio version 2020) to more precisely identify the naproxen binding mode. In
this docking, three replicas were also applied but on a restricted space, encompassing the cavity where the
ligand was blind docked. For each protein, the most representative pose of naproxen (i.e. the pose more
often found) was selected. The resulting protein-NP complexes were finally refined by a molecular
dynamics simulation using the CHARMm force field

35

and the standard dynamic cascade protocol of

Discovery studio version 2020. The free energies of naproxen binding to the various structures were
evaluated using implicit Distance-dependent dielectrics solvent model found in Discovery Studio version
2020.
Dose-response antiviral evaluation in Vero E6 cells Multi-well 6 plates were seeded with VeroE6 cells 24 h
before infection (day -1). On day 0, 90%-confluent wells were washed twice with PBS and infected with
SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. One hour after infection, the inoculum was removed
and cells were subsequently treated with the indicated dilutions of naproxen in DMEM. DMEM was used
as mock-treatment control. Plates were then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Supernatants were collected
at 48 and 72 hpi and stored at -80 °C for viral RNA extraction with the QiAmp viral RNA Kit (Qiagen) and
titration by RT-qPCR as described elsewhere21 . Drug 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50), 50% inhibitory

concentration (IC50) and selectivity index (SI) values were calculated using the Quest Graph IC50 calculator
(AAT Bioquest).
Evaluation of antiviral activity in reconstituted human airway epithelia (HAE) MucilAirTM reconstituted HAE
were obtained from Epithelix SARL (Geneva, Switzerland) and maintained in air-liquid interphase with
specific culture medium in Costar Transwell inserts (Corning, NY, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. After two washes with warm OptiMEM medium (Gibco, ThermoFisher Scientific), apical poles
were inoculated with a 150 μl dilution of virus in OptiMEM medium at a MOI of 0.1. OptiMEM was used as
mock-infection control. One hour after viral infection, MucilAirTM culture medium containing or not
(untreated) specific dilutions of naproxen in were applied through the basolateral poles. Treatments were
repeated at 24 hpi. At 48 hpi, HAE cells were harvested in RLT buffer (Qiagen) and total ARN was extracted
using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and stored at -80 °C for subsequent titration by RT-qPCR. Variations in
transepithelial electrical resistance (Δ TEER) were measured using a dedicated volt-ohm meter (EVOM2,
Epithelial Volt/Ohm Meter for TEER) and expressed as Ohm/cm 2.
