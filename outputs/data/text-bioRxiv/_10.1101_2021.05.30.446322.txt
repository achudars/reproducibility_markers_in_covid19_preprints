Abstract

25

Memory B cells (MBC) can provide a recall response able to supplement waning antibodies

26

with an affinity-matured response better able to neutralise variant viruses. We studied a

27

cohort of vulnerable elderly care home residents and younger staff, a high proportion of

28

whom had lost neutralising antibodies (nAb), to investigate their reserve immunity from

29

SARS-CoV-2-specific MBC. Class-switched spike and RBD-tetramer-binding MBC with a

30

classical phenotype persisted five months post-mild/asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection,

31

irrespective of age. Spike/RBD-specific MBC remained detectable in the majority who had lost

32

nAb, although at lower frequencies and with a reduced IgG/IgA isotype ratio. Functional

33

spike/S1/RBD-specific recall was also detectable by ELISpot in some who had lost nAb, but

34

was significantly impaired in the elderly, particularly to RBD. Our findings demonstrate

35

persistence of SARS-CoV-2-specific MBC beyond loss of nAb, but highlight the need for careful

36

monitoring of functional defects in RBD-specific B cell immunity in the elderly.

Introduction

45

The human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has had a particularly devastating impact on the elderly,

46

who are at much greater risk of morbidity and mortality.1,2 Understanding the nature of a

47

successful immune response in those who have avoided these outcomes and cleared SARS-

48

CoV-2 after a mild infection, despite advanced age, is key to protecting this vulnerable group

49

in the future. Whether older survivors of SARS-CoV-2 infection are able to mount robust and

50

durable responses with the potential to provide long-term protection from reinfection, and

51

from emerging viral variants, remains to be understood. Insights into the strengths and

52

limitations of the immune response in those who have had a successful outcome of natural

53

infection can inform the future optimisation of vaccines. It is also crucial to understand the

54

nature of the immune protection afforded to previously infected individuals whilst they await

55

vaccination, especially with the ongoing delays in rollout and the lag in provision to low and

56

middle-income countries.

57
58

Antibodies, in particular the neutralising fraction, provide a vital frontline defence to achieve

59

protective immunity against viruses. An initial waning of antibody titres is typically seen after

60

resolution of an acute viral infection.3,4 In the case of some viruses, long-lived plasma cells are

61

then able to maintain antibodies for decades.5–7 By contrast, in the months following infection

62

with other viruses, including human coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2, neutralising antibodies

63

continue to wane and can drop below the threshold of detection in a proportion of

64

individuals.3,8–13 Even if antibodies are maintained, they may fail to provide sufficient

65

functional flexibility to cross-recognise viral variants.14–16 However, antibody responses of

66

inadequate titre or unable to cross-recognise variants can be compensated by a second line

67

of defence provided by antigen-specific memory B cells (MBC), that are poised to react rapidly

68

upon pathogen re-encounter.17–19 Not only can MBC provide a faster response on re-exposure

69

to the virus, they are also able to diversify in the face of a mutating virus, resulting in more

70

potent, affinity-matured antibody response and enhanced resistance to viral mutations.9,20

71
72

In this study, we therefore analysed whether MBC develop in elderly subjects following the

73

resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection and whether they can maintain functionality once

74

neutralising antibodies (nAb) have waned. To address these questions, we studied elderly

75

residents that had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection following outbreaks in three care

76

homes in the UK, who had mild or asymptomatic infection, a substantial proportion of whom

77

lost detectable nAb by five months after outbreak resolution. MBC were compared between

78

the elderly care home residents and younger staff to assess the impact of ageing. We

79

identified MBC specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD that persisted when serum nAb had

80

completely waned. Their frequency, phenotype, isotype and function were analysed

81

according to age and/or nAb loss, to inform the assessment and boosting of durable immunity

82

in the elderly.

Results

85

SARS-CoV2 spike and RBD-specific memory B cells can persist after loss of neutralising

86

antibodies

87

To study the role of MBC, we obtained PBMC from a subset (n=32) of a large cohort who

88

survived COVID-19 with mild/asymptomatic infection after outbreaks in three care homes in

89

April 2020 (Methods and Table S1).21,22 The care home cohort subset was selected to have a

90

wide range of nAb titres detectable against live virus at the first sampling timepoint (T1, May

91

2020, Fig.1). By end September 2020 (T2, five months), 32% of all participants sampled had

92

stable or increasing nAb to live virus. In contrast, 22% had declining titres, and 38% had lost

93

detectable nAb (Fig.1a,b).

94
95

To compare MBC frequencies in those who had maintained or lost nAb, we stained PBMC

96

with SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer tetramers, made by pre-incubating recombinant biotinylated

97

trimeric spike protein with fluorescently-conjugated streptavadin.15 Dual staining with spike

98

tetramers with two distinct fluorochromes was used to enhance the discrimination of true

99

antigen-specific MBC (Fig.1c), as described previously.23–25 Frequencies of antigen-specific

100

responses were calculated within the memory fraction of B cells (CD19+CD20+ excluding IgD+,

101

CD38hi and CD21+CD27- naïve fractions, gating strategy in Fig.S1a, as previously described26).

102

A threshold for background non-specific staining was set at mean+ 2SD of staining seen in an

103

uninfected control cohort derived from the same care homes (seronegative at both time

104

points, Table S1) and from pre-pandemic healthy donor samples (Fig.S1b).

105
106

Spike-specific MBC were detectable in 28 of the 32 tested 5 months post-infection (Fig.1d).

107

The frequency of spike-specific MBC was reduced in those who had lost nAb compared to

108

those in whom they were still detectable (Fig.1e). Of note, however, most of those (85%) who

109

had lost detectable nAb still had some persistent spike-specific MBC, a comparable

110

proportion to that in the group maintaining nAb (Fig.1f). The frequency of spike-specific MBC

111

correlated significantly with the strength of the nAb response (nAb titre to live virus) at 5

112

months (Fig.1g); however, there was partial discordance due to detection of spike-specific

113

MBC in most individuals with no nAb (dotted box, Fig.1g).

114
115

Next, we analysed the MBC response specifically directed against RBD since this is the region

116

within spike which many SARS-CoV-2-specific nAb target.15,27–29 RBD-specific MBC were

117

identified by gating on dual spike tetramer-staining populations that also stained with a

118

tetramer formed from recombinant biotinylated RBD protein pre-incubated with

119

fluorescently-conjugated streptavidin (Fig.1h). RBD-specific responses were detectable in 26

120

of the 28 with sufficient magnitude spike-specific MBC responses (>20 dual-spike+ cells) to

121

allow analysis of the RBD-co-staining cells (Fig.1i). The frequency of RBD-specific MBC was

122

significantly reduced in the group who had lost nAb compared to those with stable (or waning

123

but still detectable) nAb (Fig.1i). However, as noted with spike-specific MBC, some RBD-

124

specific MBC remained detectable in most of the cohort, irrespective of whether or not they

125

had lost nAb (Fig.1j). Overall, the magnitude of RBD-specific MBC correlated with nAb titres,

126

although again there was some discordance due to RBD MBC in those who had lost nAb

127

(dotted box in Fig.1k). Importantly, both the RBD positive and RBD negative components of

128

the spike-specific B cell response significantly correlated with nAb titres, though slightly more

129

robustly for the RBD positive subset (Fig.1k, Fig.S1c). This highlights the importance of the

130

RBD as the major target for neutralising antibodies, whilst also underscoring the contribution

131

of antibodies targeting regions outside of the RBD (for example the NTD of the spike

132

protein15,29–31) to the neutralising antibody response, at the 5 month timepoint in this cohort.

133
134

These data therefore revealed the persistence of detectable, albeit reduced, MBC specific for

135

both spike and RBD in most people whose nAb titres against live virus had fallen below the

136

threshold of detection. Thus, loss of detectable nAb 5 months after asymptomatic/mild

infection is frequently compensated by the presence of a memory response primed to

138

respond upon re-exposure.

139
140
141

Comparable persistence of spike and RBD-specific MBC in elderly care home residents and

142

younger staff

143

The care home cohort was constructed to sample two comparator groups: elderly residents

144

(median age 86yrs, range 66-96) and a control group of younger staff (median age 56yrs,

145

range 41-65). Five months after asymptomatic/mild infection, similar proportions of staff and

146

residents had lost detectable nAb (Fig.2a), and those who maintained them had similar titres

147

(Fig.2b). We postulated that there may, nevertheless, be a defect in the maintenance of

148

spike/RBD-specific MBC in the elderly compared to younger age group. However, spike-

149

specific MBC were maintained at similar frequencies and in comparable proportions of the

150

elderly residents and younger staff (Fig.2c,d). There were no clear trends for spike-specific

151

MBC to decrease with increasing age, even in residents in their nineties (Fig.2e).

152
153

Similarly, RBD-specific MBC were equally well-maintained in the residents and staff (Fig.2f,g),

154

with no decline in their frequencies (as a fraction of total MBC) with increasing age (Fig.2h).

155

RBD-specific MBC comprised a variable proportion of the total spike-specific MBC response

156

(4.6 to 41.0%; median 24.0%), the remainder representing B cells targeting non-RBD regions

157

of spike. The proportions of RBD and non-RBD-binding spike-specific MBC again showed no

158

changes with age (Fig.2i).

159
160
161

Skewed isotype of spike/RBD-specific B cells associates with loss of neutralising antibodies

162

Having identified and quantified antigen-specific B cells with tetramer staining, we were able

163

to apply high-dimensional multiparameter flow cytometry to phenotype these low frequency

164

populations without any in vitro manipulation. We investigated the immunoglobulin isotype,

165

memory phenotype, homing markers and transcription factor usage of spike and RBD-specific

166

B cells, and global B cells (Fig.3).

168

The vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 MBC expressed IgG, with a similar isotype distribution

169

observed between spike and RBD-specific MBC (Fig.3a,b,c). However, individuals with

170

persistent nAb had a higher frequency of IgG isotype expressing spike- and RBD- specific MBC

171

than their counterparts who had lost nAb (Fig.3b,c), indicating the establishment of a robust,

172

class-switched memory response in these individuals. In contrast, individuals whose nAb had

173

waned below detectable limits had lost more IgG, and had a relative preservation of IgA class-

174

switched spike- and RBD- specific MBC (Fig.3b,c). Elderly residents similarly showed a trend

175

towards less IgG on their spike-specific MBC but, overall, no significant skewing of their

176

immunoglobulin class-switching compared to younger staff (Fig.3b,c). Global B cells showed

177

the same pattern of expression of different immunoglobulin isotypes on their surface in SARS-

178

CoV-2 resolved donors as in uninfected controls, with roughly equal proportions of IgG and

179

IgA and less than 15% IgM (Fig.S2a).

180
181

MBC subsets were examined using the combination of CD27 and CD21. The majority of spike

182

and RBD-specific B cells had a classical resting memory phenotype (CD27+CD21+),

183

characteristic of functional responses and comparable to the global MBC compartment, in

184

both the elderly resident and staff groups (Fig.3d,e,f, Fig.S2b). ‘Double negative B cells’ have

185

been associated with B cell dysfunction in ageing,32–34 and the ‘DN2’ subset with an

186

extrafollicular short-lived plasmablast response in the acute phase of a cohort with severe

187

COVID-19.35 However, at the five month timepoint following mild/asymptomatic infection in

188

our cohort, neither the elderly nor those who had lost nAb showed any expansion of CD27-

189

CD21- B cells (Fig.3e,f) or the DN2 subset (CD27-CD21-CXCR5loCD11chi, Fig.S2c). Instead, there

190

was a selective enrichment of the activated MBC subset (CD27+CD21-, previously described

191

to be expanded in HIV and Ebola infection or after vaccination36–38) in the RBD-binding

192

fraction in elderly residents, with the same trend in those who had lost nAb (Fig.3g). Those

193

who had lost nAb also had reduced expression of the B cell homing molecules CXCR3 and

194

CXCR5 on spike-specific and global MBC (non-significant trend and significant respectively,

195

Fig.S2d,ef). T-bet, a transcription factor critical for acute antiviral function in B cells but

196

associated with dysfunction in chronic infections and autoimmunity,39–42 also tended to be

197

expressed at lower levels in the spike-specific MBC of those losing nAb (Fig.S2e,f).

198

199

Taken together, the isotype and memory phenotype of global and antigen-specific B cells was

200

largely preserved in the elderly care home population, apart from an increase in spike-specific

201

activated MBC. Individuals who maintained nAb had predominantly IgG-expressing antigen-

202

specific MBC. In contrast, in those who had lost nAb by 5 months, whether staff or residents,

203

residual antigen-specific B cells showed preferential preservation of IgA.

204
205
206

Elderly residents maintain functional spike/RBD-specific B cells but at reduced frequency

207

compared to younger care home staff.

208

Having found that antigen-specific MBC could persist following complete waning of

209

circulating nAb, we wanted to confirm their potential for functional recall upon re-

210

encountering SARS-CoV-2. We therefore used cultured B cell ELISpots to examine the capacity

211

of persistent SARS-CoV-2-specific MBC to differentiate into plasmablasts capable of secreting

212

IgG capable of binding recombinant trimeric spike, S1 or RBD proteins.

213
214

ELISpots were performed using PBMC from 24 seropositive care home residents and staff,

215

with the threshold for detection set at the highest observed value in an uninfected controls

216

group (five seronegative care home residents and five pre-pandemic controls). Only

217

individuals with responses detectable in a control total IgG well were included in analysis.

218

Where responses were too numerous to count (TNTC), the highest number of spot-forming

219

cells (SFCs) observed in the maximal response to the respective protein was used (Fig.S3a).

220
221

Functional recall responses to SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein were observed in 21 of the

222

24 seropositive individuals tested, with ELISpots tending to be positive in more of those who

223

had maintained nAb (Fig.4a). However, the majority of those who had lost detectable nAb

224

still had a spike-specific response by ELISpot, with no significant difference in their magnitude

225

compared to the nAb group (Fig.4a). ELISpots showed similar results for IgG binding S1 and

226

RBD, with a trend to a lower proportion of positive results in those who had lost nAb but no

227

significant difference in the magnitude of B cell recall responses in those maintaining serum

228

nAb or not (Fig.4b,c).

229

230

The magnitude of RBD recall response assessed by ELISpot showed a significant correlation

231

with both spike and RBD MBC detection by tetramer staining (Fig.4d,e). However, there was

232

some discordance due to individuals who had tetramer-binding spike or RBD B cells that did

233

not produce detectable IgG by ELISpot (dotted boxes, Fig.4d,e), mainly in those who had lost

234

nAb. Importantly, these data revealed that circulating antigen-specific B cells can be detected

235

in the absence of functional recall.

236
237

Next, we compared functional responses to all three proteins for each individual, ranked

238

according to nAb status and age. Individuals with strong recall to spike (as measured by

239

ELISpot) tended to also have strong responses to S1 and RBD, whereas others had weak

240

responses to all three antigens (Fig.4f). Functional MBC recall responses decreased with

241

increasing age in both the groups, regardless of maintenance of serum nAb (Fig.4f). Thus,

242

elderly residents had significantly lower ELISpot MBC responses against spike, S1, and

243

particularly RBD, than the younger staff group (Fig.4g,h,i). Focusing on elderly residents who

244

had lost nAb, we found that none of these individuals sustained MBC capable of functional

245

recall to RBD (Fig.4j).

246
247

Overall, the measurement of nAb against live virus combined with assessment of spike and

248

RBD-specific MBC by tetramer staining and functional ELISpot provided complementary

249

insights into B cell immunity (Fig.4k). A substantial proportion of those who had lost

250

neutralising activity against live virus, maintained spike and RBD-specific MBC detectable

251

with one or both assays, regardless of age. However, some of those with persistent antigen-

252

specific MBC could not mount a detectable functional response, particularly the elderly who

253

had lost nAb (Fig.4k).

254

255

Discussion

256

In this study we sampled a cohort of very elderly residents and younger staff who developed

257

mild/asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during care home outbreaks, a high proportion of

258

whom had lost nAb by five months. This allowed us to dissect the potential for B cell memory

259

to persist beyond serum nAb, providing a back-up reserve to humoral immunity. We

260

demonstrated that the majority of the cohort maintained detectable frequencies of spike and

261

RBD-specific MBC by flow cytometry, even where they had lost circulating antibodies capable

262

of live virus neutralisation. Tetramer staining allowed accurate ex vivo quantification and

263

characterisation of antigen-specific MBC, revealing that individuals who had lost nAb had

264

lower frequencies of spike and RBD-specific MBC, with a preserved classical memory

265

phenotype but class-switching skewed away from IgG towards IgA. Elderly and younger

266

recovered individuals infected in the same care home outbreaks maintained similar

267

frequencies of spike and RBD-specific tetramer-staining B cells, with comparable phenotypes

268

and isotypes. However functional assessment using ELISpot assays demonstrated that the

269

persisting spike, and particularly RBD-specific, MBC had reduced potential for antibody

270

production in the elderly.

271
272

The success of an infection or vaccine in inducing durable humoral immunity is dependent on

273

the generation of long-lived plasma cells and MBC.17–19 The longevity of the plasma cell

274

response, capable of sustaining antibodies, varies widely following different viral infections.5–

275

7

276

against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in fifteen of nineteen individuals examined seven months

277

post infection,43 in line with the durability of some antibodies in the first year after mild

278

infection. Nevertheless, many studies have also highlighted the potential for neutralising

279

antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to wane to a point where there is an, as yet ill-defined, risk of re-

280

infection.44–46 Our study deliberately focuses on the role of MBC in those with waning or

281

undetectable nAb to live virus, despite persistence of binding antibodies. MBC, previously

282

identified in younger COVID-19 cohorts,11,26,47,48 can provide a crucial back-up by responding

283

quickly to pathogen re-encounter or vaccination to form new plasmablasts, producing potent

284

affinity-matured antibodies with more flexible recognition of viral variants;9,20 this is

285

consistent with the enhanced nAb response described following vaccination of previously

286

SARS-CoV-2 infected healthcare workers.49 Our demonstration that B cells of relevant

287

specificities can still be detected even when nAb titres are waning or completely abrogated

288

provides some reassurance that a memory response remains intact in the elderly. Future

289

large-scale studies are needed to assess whether B cell memory serves as an independent

290

correlate of protection or whether reliance on MBC to mount a new response in the absence

292

rapidly as SARS-CoV-2.

293
294

One strategy to combat antibodies that are waning or unable to cross-recognise emerging

295

variants is the use of booster vaccines. Our finding that the elderly have impaired

296

differentiation of their persistent spike/RBD-specific MBC into antibody producing cells

detected by ELISpot assays provides biological rationale for a potential need for more

frequent booster vaccination in this high-risk group. The frequency, phenotype and class-

299

switching of antigen-specific B cells did not reveal obvious changes in the elderly group to

300

account for this functional defect, other than an increase in the CD27+CD21- subset. The

301

activated CD27+CD21- subset of MBC has recently been noted to remain expanded in some

302

resolved COVID-19 patients,50 consistent with emerging literature supporting the possibility

303

of prolonged antigen persistence, exemplified by a recent study detecting SARS-CoV-2 in the

304

small bowel four months after asymptomatic infection.9 Our finding of more antigen-specific

305

CD27+CD21- MBC in the older age group raises the possibility there is more prolonged antigen

306

persistence and resultant B cell activation following SARS-CoV-2 infection in the elderly.

307

However, the ageing immune system is characterised by a tendency to low-level chronic

308

inflammation,51,52 which could also contribute to prolonged activation of SARS-CoV-2 MBC.

309

Analogous to our findings in elderly care home residents, both older subjects and those with

310

HIV have been found to have persistent circulating MBC but defective plasmablast formation,

311

resulting in reduced influenza vaccine-induced antibodies.53,54 Such age-related defects in B

312

cell responses to vaccination have been attributed to a combination of B cell intrinsic

313

senescence and defective T follicular helper cells (Tfh) in germinal centres.55–57

314
315

A caveat to our study is that we were only able to study circulating B cells, whilst additional

316

recall responses may be compartmentalised within the mucosa. A recent study suggested

317

mild infection can stimulate mucosal SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA secretion in the absence of

318

circulating antibodies.58 The bias towards the retention of IgA+ spike/RBD-specific MBC in

319

those who had lost all detectable serum nAb to live virus could therefore be reflective of a

320

stronger mucosal response in these individuals. An increase in mucosal-homing IgA responses

321

has been described as a feature of the ageing immune response,59 consistent with the older

322

composition of our cohort. Alternatively, the relative preservation of IgA rather than IgG

323

spike/RBD-specific MBC in those with the fastest waning nAb may simply reflect the recent

324

observations that IgA dominates the early nAb response to SARS-CoV-2 infection,56 and may

325

not decline as fast as the IgG response.9,60 Since our ELISpot assays did not measure the

326

function of IgA isotype B cells, we may have under-estimated the full extent of residual SARS-

327

CoV-2-specific responses, particularly in those with a more IgA-skewed response. In addition,

328

several studies have shown that the magnitude of the MBC response to SARS-CoV-2 continues

329

to increase beyond six months,9,23,50,61 again implying that we may have under-estimated the

330

extent of recall potential in our cohort at five months. Future studies should also examine the

331

preservation of non-spike-specific MBC with the potential to produce antibodies mediating

332

antiviral effects beyond neutralisation, since other viral proteins (ORF3a, membrane and

333

nucleocapsid) can play a dominant role in triggering antibody-dependent NK cell activation.62

334
335

In conclusion, by focusing on an elderly cohort with a high proportion of nAb loss, we

336

demonstrated that this waning in the first line of humoral defence can be compensated by

337

the presence of a reserve of adaptive B cell memory in the majority of cases. Our findings

338

highlight the importance of including measures of B cell memory in larger studies of natural

339

infection and vaccination to determine their role as additional correlates of protection. Our

340

data underscore that identifying antigen-specific B cells by tetramer antigen staining is useful

341

for quantitation and thorough ex vivo characterisation, but may not necessarily equate with

342

the preservation of a functional response, as also observed in chronic viral infection.42,63 The

343

relative preservation of IgA antigen-specific MBC in those with waned serum nAb raises the

344

possibility that mucosal sequestered immunity may outlast that detectable in the circulation.

345

Increased expansion of activated MBC in the elderly highlights the need to investigate

346

whether they are more prone to prolonged stimulation from persistent reservoirs of SARS-

347

CoV-2 antigen. A finding of concern was the lack of detectable functional recall to RBD in

348

elderly donors who had lost nAb; given that RBD is the dominant site for nAb this supports

349

the need for additional monitoring and/or booster vaccines to maintain sufficient antibodies

350

to neutralise emerging variants in this highly vulnerable group.

Materials and Methods

353

Participants

354

SARS-CoV-2 antigen specific memory B cell (MBC) responses were compared between elderly

355

care home resident and younger staff counterparts exposed to the virus within the same

356

environment. Six care homes reporting SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks to Public Health England (PHE)

357

were recruited to longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and serological follow-up in April 2020

358

(T0).1,21 Serostatus of individuals within these homes at one month and five months after the

359

outbreaks (T1 and T2 respectively) was established using binding and functional assays as

360

previously described.21,22 Briefly, a native virus lysate assay (PHE) and/or receptor binding

361

domain assay (RBD, PHE) determined seropositivity, and a live virus neutralising antibody

362

assay to prototype England.2 SARS-CoV-2 virus was used to determine neutralising antibody

363

titres.21,22

364
365

A total of 32 SARS-CoV-2 individuals (22 residents; 10 staff) were recruited, all of whom were

366

seropositive by the binding assays described above at both sampling time points (T1: May

367

2020, T2: September 2020), alongside 11 SARS-CoV-2 seronegative control individuals from

368

three of the care homes. Participants donated 30ml of blood to be processed for peripheral

369

blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and serum five months after the initial outbreaks (T2). The

370

investigation protocol was reviewed and approved by the PHE Research Ethics and

371

Governance Group (REGG Ref NR0204). Written information regarding the study was

372

provided to all participants; verbal consent for testing was obtained by care home managers

373

from staff members and residents or their next of kin as appropriate.

374
375

Stored pre-pandemic samples from seven healthy individuals were used as controls,

376

recruited under ethics number 11/LO/0421 approved by the 'South East Coast - Brighton

377

and Sussex Research Ethics Committee.

378
379

Sample processing and data collection

380

Venepuncture blood samples collected in lithium heparin coated and serum separation tubes

381

were used for isolation of PBMC and serum respectively. PBMC were isolated by density

382

centrifugation using Pancoll human (PAN-Biotech). Isolated PBMC were frozen in foetal

383

bovine serum (FBS) supplemented with 10% DMSO (Sigma Aldrich). Prior to use samples were

384

thawed and washed in PBS. Serum was collected following centrifugation and stored at -80

385

degrees prior to use.

386
387

Clinical and laboratory data including age, gender, symptom status at T0 and SARS-CoV-2 RT-

388

PCR status at T0 were available for all participants.(Table S1)1

389
390

Protein expression and purification

391

Recombinant spike (S) and spike receptor binding domain (RBD) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 for

392

antigen-specific B cell flow cytometry and ELISpot were expressed and purified as previously

393

described.15 Briefly, spike glycoprotein trimer (uncleaved spike stabilised in the prefusion

394

conformation (GGGG substitution at furin cleavage site and 2P mutation)64 and RBD protein12

395

were cloned into a pHLsec vector containing Avi and 6xHis tags. Biotinylated Spike and RBD

396

were expressed in Expi293F cells (Thermofisher Scientific). Supernatants were harvested after

397

7 days and purified. For the production of biotinylated protein, spike and RBD encoding

398

plasmids were co-transfected with BirA and PEI-Max in the presence of 200uM biotin.

399
400

Recombinant S1 protein constructs spanning SARS-CoV-2 residues 1-530 for ELISpot were

401

produced as previously described.28,30 Briefly, codon-optimised DNA fragments were cloned

402

into mammalian expression vector pQ-3C-2xStrep to create plasmids, which were then

403

transfected into Expi293F cells growing at 37 in 5% CO2 atmosphere using ExpiFectamine

404

reagent (Thermofisher Scientific). Proteins were purified by strep-tag affinity and

405

subsequently size exclusion chromatography.

406
407

Flow cytometry

408

High dimensional multiparameter flow cytometry was used for ex vivo identification of spike

409

and RBD- specific B cells. Two panels (surface and intranuclear) of monoclonal antibodies

410

(mAbs) were used to phenotype global and antigen specific subsets (Table S2). Biotinylated

411

tetrameric spike (1ug) and RBD (0.5ug) were fluorochrome linked for flow cytometry by

412

incubating with streptavidin conjugated APC (Prozyme) and PE (Prozyme) (Spike), and BV421

413

(Biolegend) (RBD) for 30 minutes in the dark on ice.

414

415

PBMC were thawed and incubated with Live/Dead fixable dead cell stain (UV, ThermoFisher

416

Scientific) and saturating concentrations of phenotyping mAbs (Table S2) diluted in 50%

417

1xPBS 50% Brilliant Violet Buffer (BD Biosciences). For identification of SARS-CoV-2 antigen

418

specific B cells 1ug per 500ul of stain each of tetrameric Spike-APC and Spike-PE and 0.5ug

419

per 500ul stain of tetrameric RBD-BV421 were added to the cell preparation. Parallel samples

420

stained with an identical panel of mAbs, but excluding the SARS-CoV-2 proteins (fluorescence

421

minus one controls (FMO)) were used as controls for non-specific binding.

422
423

Cells were incubated in the staining solution for 30 minutes at room temperature, washed

424

with PBS, and subsequently fixed with either fixation and permeabilization solution (BD

425

Biosciences) or FoxP3 Buffer Set (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s

426

instructions for surface and intranuclear staining respectively. Saturating concentrations of

427

mAbs diluted in 1xPBS were added following permeabilization for the detection of

428

intranuclear proteins. All samples were acquired on a Fortessa-X20 (BD Biosciences) and

429

analysed using FlowJo (TreeStar).

430
431

B cell subsets were defined as follows: MBC - CD19+CD20+ excluding IgD+, CD38hi and

432

CD21+CD27- naïve fractions, (gating strategy in Supp.Fig1a), DN2 - CD19+CD20+CD38+/-CD21-

433

CD27-CD11chiCXCR5lo. For analysis of RBD- co-staining cells sufficient magnitude spike-specific

434

MBC (≥20 dual-spike+ cells) were required. For phenotypic analysis of spike-specific and RBD-

435

specific cells sufficient magnitude responses (≥50 cells in the relevant parent gate) were

436

required.

437
438

MBC recall response to SARS-CoV-2: ELISpot

439

To activate MBC differentiation, 1x106 PBMC were stimulated with 1ug/ml R848 (TLR7/8

440

agonist; Resiquimod (Invivogen)) diluted in complete RPMI (cRPMI; RPMI supplemented with

441

10% FBS plus recombinant human IL-2 (20IU/ml; Peprotech), as previously described.65,66

442

Activated cells were incubated for six days with a media change on day three.

443
444

ELISpot plates (Mabtech) were pre-coated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike

445

(1µg/ml), S1 (1µg/ml) and RBD (10µg/ml) and anti-human IgG (1µg/ml Jackson

446

Immunoresearch) overnight at 4oC. Coated plates were blocked with cRPMI with 10% FBS

447

prior to the addition of cells. Cultured PBMC were added at varying concentrations depending

448

on SARS-CoV-2 antigen and incubated at 37oC at 5% CO2 for 18 hours: 50,000 cells/ well to

449

detect spike- specific IgG secreting cells; 100,000 cells/well to detect S1 and RBD IgG secreting

450

cells; and 1000 cells/well for detection of total IgG secreting cells. To control for non-specific

451

binding, uncoated control wells were incubated with 100,000 pre-stimulated cells. The

452

following day, ELISpot plates were washed in filtered PBS supplemented with 0.5% Tween 20

453

(Merck) and incubated for four hours in the dark at room temperature with 1ug/ml goat anti-

454

human IgG horse radish peroxidase antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch). Cells were again

455

washed three times with PBS-Tween 20 (0.5%) and three times with PBS, then developed with

456

3-Amino-9-ethylcarbazole (AEC) substrate (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s

457

instructions.

(Autoimmun Diagnostika). All conditions were performed in duplicate and responses

459

averaged.

ELISpot plates were washed with ddH20 before analysis using ViruSpot

460
461

Data analysis and statistics

462

Data were analysed using GraphPad Prism. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed.

463

Continuous data that did not follow a normal distribution were described as medians with

464

interquartile ranges and differences compared using the Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon’s

465

paired t-test or Kruskal Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc test for pairwise multiple

466

comparisons as appropriate. Contingency table analyses were conducted using Fisher’s exact

467

test. Correlations for non-parametric data were assessed using Spearman’s rank correlation

468

with 95% CI.
