Abstract:
The first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS CoV2) was imported to Pakistan
in February 2020 since then 10,258 deaths have been witnessed. The virus has been mutating
and local transmission cases from different countries vary due to host dependent viral
adaptation. Many distinct clusters of variant SARS CoV2 have been defined globally. In this
study, the epidemiology of SARS CoV2 was studied and locally transmitted SARS CoV2
isolates from Karachi were sequenced to compared and identify any possible variants.The
real time PCR was performed on nasopharyngeal specimen to confirm SARSCoV2 with Orf
1ab and E gene as targets. The viral sequencing was performed through oxford nanopore
technology MinION platform. Isolates from first and second wave of COVID-19 outbreak in
Karachi were compared. The overall positivity rate for PCR was 26.24% with highest number
of positive cases in June. Approximately, 37.45% PCR positive subjects aged between 19-40
years. All the isolates belonged to GH clade and shared missense mutation D614G in spike
protein linked to increased transmission rate worldwide. Another spike protein mutation
A222V coexisted with D614G in the virus from second wave of COVID-19. Based on the
present findings it is suggested that the locally transmitted virus from Karachi vary from
those reported from other parts of Pakistan. Slight variability was also observed between
viruses from first and second wave. Variability in any potential vaccine target may result in
failed trials therefore information on any local viral variants is always useful for effective
vaccine design and/or selection.
Key words: SARS CoV2; variants; COVID-19; locally transmitted virus
Author’s summary:
Despite precautionary measures the COVID-19 pandemic is causing deaths all over the
world. The continuous mutations in viral genome is making it difficult to design vaccines.

Variability in genome is host dependent and data sharing has revealed that variant for
different geographical locations may harbor different mutations. Keeping this in mind the
current study was focused on the epidemiology of SARS CoV2 in symptomatic and
asymptomatic COVID –19 suspected cases with impact of age and gender. The locally
transmitted SARS CoV2 isolates from Karachi were sequenced to compared and identify any
possible variants. The sequenced viral genome varied from the already submitted sequences
from Pakistan thereby confirming that slightly different viruses were causing infections
during different time periods in Karachi. All belonged to GH clade with D614G, P323L and
Q57H mutations. The virus from second wave had A222V mutation making it more different.
This information can be useful in selecting or designing a vaccine.

Introduction:
Corona virus disease (COVID-19) is a transmissible infectious disease caused by a newly
emerged beta corona virus - SARS CoV2 originated as a result of viral spill over from
animals[1]. It is a positive sense, enveloped, single stranded RNA virus of genus
betacoronavirus [2]. The exact origin of this virus either from bat, pangolin or any other
mammal is still under debate[1,3]. Metagenomic analysis of SARS Cov2 has revealed that it
a distinct virus very closely related to SARS CoV. COVID-19 pandemic started in December
2019 after first reports from Wuhan China[3,4]. To date it has affected 188 countries with a
death rate of 2.31%. The death rate for SARS CoV2 infection is lower than SARS CoV with
a higher transmission capability [5]. The global elderly population was most affected with
higher mortalities due to acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS). The first SARS Cov2
genome was sequenced and published in December 2019 by Wang et al[6]. The genome of
SARS CoV2 is ~29.9 kb long with orf1ab at the 5’end and spike protein(S), envelope protein

(E) and matrix protein (M) coded at the 3’ end. Seven viral accessory proteins are also coded
by ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8a, ORF8b and ORF10 genes[7]. The virus has
sixteen non-structural proteins (NS1-NS16). The infection initiates with lower respiratory
discomfort which progress to pneumonia often causing sudden deaths [4,8]. The virus
establishes itself by binding through receptor binding spike protein to angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in lungs [4]. Data from various studies support that a virus
induced excessive exaggerated immune reaction or cytokine storming extensively damage
tissues ACE2 receptors expressing organs in the host [2].
In the recent outbreak of COVID-19 asymptomatic carrier were capable of transmitting virus
to healthy human. As reported earlier, during SARS CoV outbreak in 2002/2003 variant
viruses evolved due to possible transformation events within host [9]. Likewise, since its first
report many mutations have been reported in SARS CoV2. A large number of SARS CoV2
sequences have been deposited in respective repositories since the beginning of the
pandemic[10,11]. Due to relatively lower mutation rates different branches or clades have
been defined[12]. The clinical significance of all these clades is yet to be defined. As per
Nextstrain an open source project so far five large clades of SARS CoV2 (19A, 19B, 20A,
20B and 20C) have been identified all over the world. The earlier strains identified in 2019
belonged to clade 19A and 19B. The clade 19B (GISAID S) differed from the root clade 19A
by substitutions of C>T and T>C at positions 8782 and 28144 respectively. The clade 20 A
had unique substitutions of C>T at positions 3037 and 14408 along with substitution
G>C28883. The clade 20B originated with consecutive substations 28881G>A, 28882G>A,
and 28883G>C whereas 20C has substitutions 1059C>T and 25563G>T. The clades 19A and
19B were geographically linked to Asia. The clades 20A and 20B were prevalent in Europe
therefore seemed to originate from there. The prevalent strain in North America was the clade
20C in later half of 2020. The SARS CoV2 sequences submitted from Pakistan belonged to

clades 19A, 19B, 20A and 20B. Rapid whole genome sequencing coupled with prompt data
sharing is the key to understand the emergence of variants and geographic epidemiology of
SARS CoV2 variants during current pandemic[13]. Clinical correlation of these variants with
disease transmission dynamic, treatment responsiveness and fatality rates have also been
extensively studied[14]. Among the various sequencing platforms third generation
sequencing of SARS CoV whole genome by Oxford nanopore MinIon technology based
sequencing has gained popularity. The advantage of this plat form is that long reads of virus
genome are obtained and time to data acquisition and analysis is also reduced as compared to
other methodologies [15]. The objective of present study was to evaluate the epidemiology of
SARS CoV2 in symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID –19 suspected cases with impact of
age and gender. Furthermore, locally transmitted SARS CoV2 isolates from Karachi were
sequenced to compared and identify any possible variants.
Results:
Two thousand and sixty five (2065) PCR tests were performed from May to November 2020
at COVID-19 Lab. of NIBD. The overall positivity rate for PCR was 26.24%. Highest
number of positive cases with increased viral load (lower Ct values) was observed during the
month of June (Fig 1a). The Ct value for SARS CoV2 ranged between 10.8 to 34.32 in June
with a median Ct value of 24.2 (Fig 1b). After the first wave of COVID-19 in Karachi an
increase in positive cases was observed in October; after a decline in August and September;
with the lowest median Ct value (20.21) between May to November (Fig 1a). A large number
of patients were negative for SARS CoV2 with COVID-19 like symptoms caused by
probably some other viral or bacterial infection. The commonest symptom was weakness for
PCR positive and PCR negative groups. The frequency of SARS CoV2 positive males
(27.5%) was slightly higher than females (26.28%). Approximately 37.45% PCR positive
subjects aged between 19-40 years.

Viral whole genome sequencing
Four samples with low Ct values <20 (range: 10.08-19.69) were selected. Of the four
sequenced samples two were isolated from asymptomatic while other two from mild or
moderate COVID-19 patients each. The age range of selected cases was 22-58 years. Full
viral genome sequences from these confirmed cases of local transmission of SARS CoV2
from Karachi during June (peak of first wave) and October (initial phase of second wave)
were obtained through MinIon ONT platform. The sequencing details with GISAID
accession numbers are listed in Table 1. The genome size obtained was 29903 with depth of
coverage between 2976-3653 (Table 1).
Phylogenetic profiling:
The whole genome sequences obtained were aligned with the reference genome and 564
global sequences.

strains NIBD 01-PAK-KHI and NIBD 02-PAK-KHI clustered with

variants from Bangladesh and India with descendent predominantly from Saudi Arabia, India
and England. New nodes were defined for NIBD 03-PAK-KHI and NIBD 04-PAK-KHI with
divergence of 14 and 27 respectively. Both these were clustered with separate sequences from
New Zealand having presumed ancestral connection with isolates from Germany.
The phylogenetic relatedness with previously submitted sequences from Pakistan, India,
Saudi Arabia, Netherland, England, New Zealand was observe with a pair wise mean genetic
distance of 0.011.
Mutational analysis
The mutational analysis revealed presence of 21 synonymous mutations, 15 non-synonymous
mutations and 2 non-frame shift substitutions altogether, spanning in 5’UTR, spike, orf1ab,
orf1a, orf3a, orf7a, orf 8, orf10, N and M protein genes (Table 2). All the four sequences

were grouped in clade 20A (GISAID: GH) since characteristic mutation in 5’UTR 241 C>T
and nonsynonymous SNV i.e. 3037C>T, 23403A>G (S-D614G), 25563G>T (Q57H) were
observed. As per GISAID database four previously submitted sequences from Pakistan also
belonged to GH clade but sub-lineage signatures vary with 32 additional mutations observed
in the sequences obtained during present study from local transmission cases of Karachi
(Table 2). Hence, all the genome sequences were unrelated to the previously reported cluster
of SARS CoV2 from Pakistan except for four isolates; 3 from Islamabad and 1 from Kohat
belonging to GH clade lineage B (Table 1; Fig 3). The NIBD4-PAK-KHI obtained from a
health care worker varied from the other isolates with highest number of mutations (Table 2).
An additional clade GV specific nonsynonymous variant 22227C>T (A222V) in spike
protein was also present inNIBD4-PAK-KHI along with .About 7% of all GISAID sequences
belonged to GV clade which is characterized by presence of this SNV. The virus NIBD4PAK-KHI is the first variant of GH clade harboring 22227C>T isolated in October from
Asia. Close but divergent sequence homology was detected with a variant virus from New
Zealand collected in November 2020 (GISAID accession no: EPI_ISL_682284; Fig 3).

Discussion:
Karachi is the most populous major metropolitan city of Pakistan. The first imported case of
COVID-19 in a returning traveler from Iran was detected in Karachi and the city became the
most badly affected area of Pakistan during the first wave of COVID-19. This study is one of
the initial report on epidemiological and molecular landscape of SARS CoV2 from Karachi.
Based on the retrospective data from NIBD the PCR positivity rate for SARS CoV2 was
24.2% in June (the peak of first wave) which dropped to 5% during September. The positive
cases per day increased in October (Fig 1) with a lowest median Ct value observed in October
as compared to other months. The increasing trend in PCR positivity correlated well with the
regional increase in COVID-19 cases in Sindh. In order to contain SARS CoV2 transmission
and also to reduce the possible burden on the striving national healthcare system, the
government of Pakistan has officially imposed smart lockdown declaring second wave of
COVID-19 with increased cases on 28th October 2020. In order to evaluate any possible
genetic variability in community transmitted SARS CoV2 in Karachi four confirmed
indigenous SARS CoV2 viruses were randomly selected from the peak of first wave and
initial phase of second wave of COVID-19. The genome sequencing was performed through
ONT MinIon platform. ONT is claimed to be the most accurate, sensitive and quick method
with reduced PCR based bias for detecting minute changes in viral genome. Samples are
barcoded to facilitate multiplexing and the tiling generates precise long stretches of genome

which could be read easily through defined pipelines thereby decreasing the time for postacquisition analysis of SARS CoV2 genome [15]. To the best of our knowledge this is the
first study from Pakistan on SARS CoV2 genome exploiting the potential of this third
generation sequencing method.
The evolution of SARS CoV2 is nonrandom and human host dependent variants are evolving.
with over 272,829 virus sequence depositions in GISAID Initiative (epicov.org) alone [16].
SARS CoV2 proteins are heterogeneous with a large number of variable amino acid
substitutions with either no or significant impact on viral transmission and transcription
within human host [17]. Many prevalent mutations have been defined for SARS CoV2 with
signature hotspot mutation for each distinct clade [18].

The lineages for studied viruses

were defined through PANGOLINE pipeline and all were placed in lineage B1. with sub
lineage differences listed in Table 1. The 23403A>G is a widely documented hotspot
mutation in spike protein which replaces aspartic acid with glycine at position 614 altering
the viral antigenic properties [19]. Variants with D416G evade initial immune recognition by
host resulting in production of autoantibodies and facilitate higher- transmission, infectivity
and case fatality rate (CFR). All the sequenced viruses of current study had this mutation
along with Q57H in orf3a gene grouping them in Nextstrain clade 20A (GISAID: GH; Table
2). The coexisting Q57H has previously been reported to reduce the virulence of D614G
therefore the prevalence of the GH clade in Pakistan may be a probable reason for low
mortality rate (2.1%) for COVID-19 cases during July to September. Furthermore, the Q57H
amino acid substitution causes truncation of orf3b gene via introduction of a stop codon at
amino acid 13 giving rise to full length orf 3b deficient variants [20,21]. These variants were
prevalent in Asian and North American countries, including Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, South
Korea, Israel, Egypt, USA and Colombia [5,22,23]. All the Pakistani viruses sequenced
between June to November 2020 belonged to GH clade with Q57H substitution (Fig 3). The

orf3b is a potential serological target for most vaccines, hence, this serological difference
should be taken into account while selecting a vaccine for SARS CoV2 in Pakistan. Another
prevalent mutation in Pakistani GH isolates is non-frameshift substitution P323L in NSP12
which was linked to higher severity [20]. Almost a 100% coexistence of D614G, P323L and
C241T has been reported which is in line with the present observations. This coexistence
positively favors viral replication, infectivity, transmission and manipulation of host
machinery[24]. Of the 39 mutations observed in the SARS CoV2 genomes sequenced during
the present study; 33 SNVs were not observed in previously submitted sequences from
Pakistan defining a separate local cluster for SARS CoV2 virus accumulating within Karachi
(Fig 2). It may be because of the host driven genetic drift within the viral genome of locally
transmitted SARS CoV2 virus [25].
Spike A222V mutation was reported from Spain during spring 2020 and clade GV (20A
EU1) of SARS CoV2 was defined with increased infectivity and fatality potential [26]. Many
mutations overlap between G clade. The global coexistence of A222V mutation within GH
clade viruses is rare (0.0015%; GISAID Initiative (epicov.org) with total 84 viruses. The
NIBD04 PAK-KHI carried this mutation and is the first sequence from Asia with this unique
coexistence sharing ancestral origin from Europe. Within Europe and USA; the A222V is
associated with newer waves of COVID-19 with increase viral loads, similarly the virus from
the initial phase of second wave of COVID-19 in Karachi was presented with it. It can be
assumed that the median viral load corresponding with lower median Ct value may be an
indirect indication of accumulation of this virus in Karachi which needs further confirmation
via sequencing of virus from the second wave. Another possible reason for this variance in
NIBD04 PAK-KHI could be coinfection with two variants of SARS CoV2. The coinfection
has been reported with a low prevalence rate of 1.5% in healthcare workers globally. In

either case caution is warranted since infectivity potential for this variant is higher throughout
Europe.
Conclusion:
Hence it can be concluded that the second wave of COVID-19 may not be clinically distinct
but host driven genetic evolution of virus may impact its infectivity and CFR. Future
comparative genomic studies with substantial number of virus from first and second waves
are suggested in order to understand the possible evolutionary origin, genomic variability and
trajectory of anticipated futures waves.
Methods:
This study was conducted at National Institute of Blood Diseases & Bone Marrow
Transplantation after approval from NIBD Bioethics committee. A total of 2065 patients of
either gender were enrolled. A detailed proforma was filled inorder to obtain the background
exposure and brief clinical history of all patients. Sample were collected from nasopharynx of
suspected COVID-19 patients and transported in VTM to the laboratory for virus RNA
extraction using Favorgene viral RNA extraction kit (Cat# FAVNK 001-2, Favrgene Bio
Corp,Taiwan). The real time PCR was performed using CE IVD marked Bosphore Novel
Corona virus detection kit ( Cat # ABCOW6, Anatolia Geneworks, Turkey) with orf1ab and
E genes as viral targets.
Viral whole genome sequencing
RNA was extracted from fournasopharyngeal samples positive for SARS CoV2. All the
patients were confirmed local transmission cases from Karachi. Viral RNA extracted from
both asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients were included. Whole genome
sequencing was performed as previously described through ONT MinIon platform. Briefly,
cDNA was prepared from viral RNA using random primer mix (NEB, Massachusetts, United

States), and LunaScript® RT SuperMix Kit (Cat# E3010G). The cDNA was enriched using
Q5 high-fidelity DNA polymerase (Cat #: M0492; NEB, USA) and ARTIC v3 primers
(Integrated DNA Technologies (ITD), Belgium). The 400bp amplicon was used for library
preparation after purification by AMPure XP beads (Agencourt Beckman Coulter™ A63881)
and quantification with a Qubit fluorometerusing QubitTM RNA BR Assay kit (Cat #,
Q10210, ThermoFisher Scientific,Massachusetts, United States) . For sequencing SQKLSK104 ligation kit was used and samples were loaded as per standard protocol on a
MinION MK1B instrument. All the samples were multiplexed in one run after barcoding.
The samples were run for 72 hours on R9 flow cell. The acquired data was aligned in real
time with SARS CoV2 reference sequence (NC_045512.2) using Min Know Files in
SAM/BAM format were accessed by SAM tools v. 1.9-11.
Variant calling and phylogenetic profiling
Variant calling was performed using BCF tools v. 1.9. Further variant annotation was done
by ANNOVAR. The consensus sequences were generated by mapping the variants to the
reference genomes using BCF tools followed by submission to the GISAID database and
NCBI. The initial phylogenetic analysis was performed using 570 genome sequences
retrieved from the GISAID, epicovTM. The fast alignment was performed using MAFFT.
Moreover, IQ-TREE v. 2.1.2 provided by Augur (github.com/nextstrain/augur) was used to
infer maximum-likelihood trees. The generated tree was visualized using FigTree
1.4.3(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree). Viral clades were identified by nucleotide or
amino acid substitutions and Nextstrain nomenclature (https://nextstrain.org/ncov) was
followed for matching.
Genomic epidemiological analysis was performed using 564 complete sequences downloaded
from GISAID database. Phylogenetic tree was constructed using NEXTSTRAIN
(https://www.nextstain.org) via augur pipeline, after inclusion of the four sequences from the

robustness of individual nodes was statistically determined by comparing with 1000
bootsteps replicates. The viral lineage was determined by using Phylogenetic Assignment of
Named Global Outbreak LINeages tool (https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin).
Statistical analysis
Median Ct values per month for Orf1ab gene were recorded from May to November 2020.
For statistical analyses and graphs SPSS version 22 was used.
