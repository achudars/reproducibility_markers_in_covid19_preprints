Abstract
Noncanonical nucleic acid structures play important roles in the regulation of molecular processes.
Considering the importance of the ongoing coronavirus crisis, we decided to evaluate genomes of all
coronaviruses sequenced to date (stated more broadly, the order Nidovirales) to determine if they
contain noncanonical nucleic acid structures. We discovered much evidence of putative G-quadruplex
sites and even much more of inverted repeats (IRs) loci, which in fact are ubiquitous along the whole
genomic sequence and indicate a possible mechanism for genomic RNA packaging. The most notable
enrichment of IRs was found inside 5′UTR for IRs of size 12+ nucleotides, and the most notable
enrichment of putative quadruplex sites (PQSs) was located before 3′UTR, inside 5′UTR, and before
mRNA. This indicates crucial regulatory roles for both IRs and PQSs. Moreover, we found multiple
G-quadruplex binding motifs in human proteins having potential for binding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Noncanonical nucleic acids structures in Nidovirales and in novel SARS-CoV-2 are therefore
promising druggable structures that can be targeted and utilized in the future.

Introduction
The order Nidovirales is a monophyletic group of animal RNA viruses. This group can be divided

into the six distinct families of Arteriviridae, Coronaviridae, Mesnidovirineae, Mononiviridae,
Ronidovirineae and Tobaniviridae. All known Nidovirales have single-stranded, polycistronic RNA
genomes of positive polarity (Modrow et al., 2013). Due to the Severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic (November 2002 – July 2003, Southern China), Middle
East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreaks (January 2014 – May 2014,
Saudi Arabia and May 2015 – June 2015, South Korea), and the most recent Severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) worldwide pandemic (starting in November 2019 in Wuhan,
China), this viral group is now extensively studied (Hung, 2003; Cowling et al., 2015; Oboho et al.,
2015; Li et al., 2020).
The small size of RNA virus genomes is in principle linked to their limited ability for RNA
synthesis, which is directly connected to a replication complex containing RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp) without reparation mechanisms (Gorbalenya et al., 2006). These RNA viruses can
generate one mutation per genome per replication round (Drake and Holland, 1999). This combination
of features means that RNA viruses are able to adapt to new environmental conditions, but they are
limited in expanding their genomes because they must keep their mutation load low so that their
survival is possible (Eigen and Schuster, 1977; Lauring et al., 2013; Carrasco-Hernandez et al., 2017).
Nidovirales bind to their host cell receptors on the cell surface, after which fusion of the viral and
cellular membranes is mediated by one of the surface glycoproteins. This mechanism, which progresses
in the cytoplasm or endosomal membrane, releases the nucleocapsid into the host cell’s cytoplasm.
After genome “transportation,” translation of two replicase open reading frames (ORFs) is initiated by
host ribosomes. This results in large polyprotein precursors that undergo autoproteolysis to eventually
produce a membrane-bound replicase/transcriptase complex. This complex initiates synthesis of the
genome RNA and controls the synthesis of structural and some other proteins. New virus particles are
assembled by association of the new genomes with the cytoplasmic nucleocapsid protein and
subsequent envelopment of the nucleocapsid structure. Subsequently, the viral envelope proteins are
inserted into intracellular membranes and targeted to the site of virus assembly (most often membranes
between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex) and then they meet up with the nucleocapsid
and trigger the budding of virus particles into the lumen of the membrane compartment. The newly
formed virions then leave the cell by following the exocytic pathway toward the plasma membrane

(Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Gorbalenya, 2001; Snijder et al., 2003; Ziebuhr, 2004; Gorbalenya et al.,
2006).
Today, SARS-CoV-2 is being studied intensively by scientists all over the world due to the
ongoing 2020 coronavirus pandemic (Cohen, 2020). The origin of this virus is unknown, but recently
a two-hit scenario was proposed wherein SARS-CoV-2 ancestors in bats first acquired genetic
characteristics of SARS-CoV by incorporating a SARS-like receptor-binding domain through
recombination prior to 2009; subsequently, the lineage that led to SARS-CoV-2 accumulated further,
unique changes specifically within this domain (Patino-Galindo et al., 2020). As true of SARS-CoV,
cell entry by SARS-CoV-2 depends upon angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and
transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for viral spike protein priming (Hoffmann et al., 2020).
The genome of SARS-CoV-2 was sequenced and annotated in early January 2020 (Wu et al., 2020). A
recent study revealed that the transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 is highly complex due to numerous
canonical and noncanonical recombination events. Moreover, it was found that SARS-CoV-2 produces
transcripts encoding unknown ORFs and at least 41 potential RNA modification sites with an AAGAA
motif were discovered in its RNA (Kim et al., 2020).
G-quadruplex binding proteins (QBPs) play crucial roles in many signaling pathways, including
such biologically highly relevant activities as cell division, dysregulations of which lead to cancer
development (Wu et al., 2008; Brázda et al., 2014). QBPs have been found to be involved in various
viral infection pathways. An interesting example is HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein NCp7. It has been
described how this protein helps to resolve an otherwise very stable G-quadruplex structure in viral
RNA that stalls reverse transcription (Butovskaya et al., 2019). Various G-quadruplex-forming
aptamers are used as drugs against many different viral proteins, suggesting a prominent role for QBPmediated regulation. Among many other viruses, in particular Hepatitis C virus, HIV-1, and SARSCoV are targets of these G-quadruplex-forming aptamers (Platella et al., 2017). Quadruplex binding
domain has been found in nonstructural protein 3 (Nsp3) (Lei et al., 2018). This so-called SARSUNIQUE-DOMAIN (SUD), and especially its M subdomain, was observed to be essential for SARS
replication in host cells. Deletion or even substitution mutations in key RNA-interacting amino acids
were shown to result in viral inability to replicate within host cells (Kusov et al., 2015). Moreover, this
subdomain was found also in MERS and several other coronaviruses (Kusov et al., 2015).
G-quadruplexes are secondary nucleic acid structures formed in guanine-rich strands (Burge et
al., 2006; Vorlíčková et al., 2012; Kolesnikova and Curtis, 2019). These have been detected in various

genomes, but most extensively they have been described in human genomes (Chambers et al., 2015;
Bedrat et al., 2016; Hänsel-Hertsch et al., 2016). They are present also in viruses (Lavezzo et al., 2018;
Frasson et al., 2019). G-quadruplexes probably play an important role in regulating replication in most
viral nucleic acids (Lavezzo et al., 2018), and these structures have been suggested as targets for
antiviral therapy (Métifiot et al., 2014; Ruggiero and Richter, 2018). Along with cruciforms and
hairpins, which can be formed in nucleic acids by inverted repeats (IRs), G-quadruplexes are significant
genome elements playing specific biological roles. They are involved, for example, in the regulation
of DNA replication and transcription (Bagga et al., 1990; Limanskaya, 2009; Brázda et al., 2011). It
has been demonstrated that IRs are important for various processes in viruses, including their genome
organization (Li and Li, 2010; Ishimaru et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2017; Bridges et al., 2019). Another
interesting RNA motif that has been used as a drug target and was found in SARS-CoV targeted by
1,4-diazepame is the “slippery sequence” followed by a pseudoknot (Plant et al., 2005). This structure,
common among all coronaviruses, works based on ribosomal −1 frameshifting that switches on viral
fusion proteins (Plant et al., 2005).
In all prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, as well as viruses, there have been found sequence motifs
such as IR sequences forming cruciforms and hairpins or G-rich sequences that form G-quadruplexes
(Brázda et al., 2011; Lavezzo et al., 2018; Bartas et al., 2019). In the present research, we conducted a
systematic and comprehensive bioinformatic study searching for the occurrence of IRs and putative
quadruplex sites (PQSs) within the genomes of all known Nidovirales. The aim was to find one or
more potential druggable RNA targets to address the present COVID-19 threat (Figure 1).

Materials and Methods

2.1 Genome Source
Linear genomes of 109 viruses from the order Nidovirales were downloaded from the genome database
of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Full names, phylogenetic groups, exact
NCBI accession numbers, and further information are summarized in Supplementary Material 1.

2.2 Nidovirales Phylogenetic Tree Construction
Exact taxonomic identifiers of all analyzed Nidovirales species (obtained from Taxonomy Browser via
NCBI Taxonomy Database [Drake and Holland, 1999]) were downloaded to phyloT: a tree generator
(http://phylot.biobyte.de) and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the function “Visualize in
iTOL” in the Interactive Tree of Life environment (Letunic and Bork, 2019).

2.3 Analyses of PQSs Occurrence in Nidovirales Sequences
Nidovirales sequences were analyzed using our G4Hunter Web Tool (Brázda et al., 2019). The
software is capable to read the NCBI identifier of the sequences uploaded in a .csv file. The parameters
for G4Hunter were set to 25 as window size and G4Hunter score above 1.2. The results for each
analyzed sequence contained information about the size of the genome and number of putative PQSs.
All the results were merged into a single Microsoft Excel file where statistical analysis was then made.
We also downloaded features tables of each virus from the NCBI database. These tables contain
information about known features in the genome of each species. We searched the occurrence of Gquadruplex-forming sequences before, inside, and after the specific features of each genome using a
predefined feature neighborhood ± 100 nucleotides (nt). Data were then plotted in Excel, where the
statistical analysis was made. Complete analyses of PQSs occurrence in Nidovirales are provided in
Supplementary Material 2.

2.4 Analyses of IRs Occurrence in Nidovirales Sequences
All Nidovirales genomes were analyzed by the core of our Palindrome analyser webserver (Brázda et
al., 2016). The software was modified to read NCBI identifiers of sequences from text files. The size
of IRs was set to 6–30 nt, size of spacers to 1–10 nt, and maximally one mismatch was allowed. A
separate list of IRs in each of the 109 sequences and an overall report were exported. The overall report
contained the lengths of the analyzed sequences, total number of IRs found, numbers of IRs grouped
by size of IR (6–30 nt), and sum of IRs longer than 8 nt, 10 nt and 12 nt. The software also counted
frequency of IRs in each sequence. Frequencies of IRs were normalized per 1,000 nt. Features tables
of 109 Nidovirales genomes were downloaded from the NCBI database and grouped by their names as
stated in the feature table file. Analyses of IRs occurrence inside and around (before and after) these
features was performed. The search for IRs took place in predefined feature neighborhoods ± 100 nt
around and inside feature boundaries. We calculated the numbers of all IRs and of those longer than 8,
10, and 12 nt in regions before, inside, and after the features. The categorization of an IR according to
its overlap with a feature or feature neighborhood is demonstrated by the example shown in
Supplementary Material 3. Complete analyses of IRs occurrence in Nidovirales are provided in
Supplementary Material 4.

2.5 RNA Fold Predictions
In order to be able to display higher structures of the coronavirus genome, we used Galaxy’s freeonline webserver (Afgan et al., 2018) and its RNA fold tool (Lorenz et al., 2011). This tool allows
quick calculation of minimum free energy of secondary structures. We left the default parameters
(Temperature 37 °C, Unpaired bases to participate in all dangling ends, Naview layout). We used
SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA sequence (NC_045512.2) in FASTA format as the input format. The
output data were then displayed using the RNA plot tool [3]. We again left the default parameters
(Naview layout, Output format Postscript .ps). We then downloaded the displayed secondary structures
in high-resolution format. The raw data are provided in Supplementary Material 5.

2.6 Multiple Alignment of SUD Domains (M Regions) in Nsp3 of Pathogenic Species
Multiple protein alignment was done using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) under default parameters (UGENE
[Okonechnikov et al., 2012] workflow was used). The following accessions were used: NP_828862.2
(Nsp3 SARS-CoV), YP_009047231.1 (Nsp3 MERS-CoV), and YP_009725299.1 (Nsp3 SARS-CoV2). Conserved regions were added according to a graph published previously (Kusov et al., 2015).

2.7 Prediction of Human RNA-Binding Proteins Sites in SARS-CoV-2 RNA
The human SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence was downloaded from NCBI (accession NC_045512.2) in
FASTA format and inserted into the RBPmap (Mapping Binding Sites of RNA-binding proteins) webbased tool (Paz et al., 2014). The database of 114 human experimentally validated motifs was used.
Both the “High stringency” and “Apply conservation filter” options were used. The output was further
filtered in Excel to keep only those hits below p-value = 1.10-6. The complete results are provided in
Supplementary Material 6.

3.1 Phylogenetic Relationships in Nidovirales
According to the current state of knowledge, the order Nidovirales can be divided into six distinct
families, and there are two unclassified species (Figure 2). Coronaviridae is the largest family and
consists of 56 species. Among these are 12 species able to infect humans, including SARS-CoV,
MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Second largest is the Arteriviridae family with 22 species, third largest
is the Mesnidovirineae family with 13 species, fourth is the Tobaniviridae family with 11 species,

3.2 Variation in PQS Frequency in Nidovirales
We analyzed the occurrence of PQSs using G4Hunter in all 109 known genomes of Nidovirales. The
length of genomes in the dataset varies from 12,704 nt (Equine arteritis virus) to 41,178 nt (Planarian
secretory cell nidovirus). The mean GC content is 42.15%, the minimum is 27.50% for Planarian
secretory cell nidovirus (Mononiviridae family), and the maximum is 57.35% for Beihai Nido-like
virus 1 (Mesnidovirineae family). Using standard values for the G4Hunter algorithm (i.e., window size
25 and G4Hunter score above 1.2), we found 1,021 PQSs among all 109 Nidovirales genomes. The
most abundant PQSs are those with G4Hunter scores of 1.2–1.4 (98.24% of all PQS), much less
abundant are PQSs with G4Hunter scores 1.4–1.6 (1.76% of all PQS), and there were no PQSs above
the 1.6 G4Hunter score threshold. In general, a higher G4Hunter score means a higher probability of
G-quadruplexes forming inside the PQS (Bedrat et al., 2016). Genomic sequence sizes, total PQS
counts, and PQS frequencies characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

The highest PQS frequencies were found in Beihai Nido-like virus 1, which is an intracellular parasite
of sea snails in genus Turritella. Beihai Nido-like virus 1 has in total 184 PQSs in its genomic sequence
20,278 nt long and PQS frequency of 9.07 PQS per 1,000 nt. On the other hand, no PQSs were found
in the genomic sequences of 16 other Nidovirales species. The mean PQS value for all Nidovirales was

0.48 PQS per 1,000 nt. By viral families, the highest mean PQS frequency per 1,000 nt was in
Arteriviridae (1.18), followed by in Mesnidovirineae (1.03), much lower in Tobaniviridae (0.43) and
in Ronidovirineae (0.39), and the lowest was in Coronaviridae (0.10). When grouped and analyzed by
host organisms, new information became apparent. The highest mean PQS frequency was in
Nidovirales infecting Invertebrates (0.80), then in Nidovirales infecting Vertebrates including Humans
(0.38), and the last in Nidovirales infecting Humans (0.06). In pathogenic human coronaviruses, the
total PQSs counts were as follow: 4 PQS in SARS-CoV, 0 PQS in MERS-CoV, and 1 PQS in SARSCoV-2. To test whether the PQS frequency per 1,000 nt in SARS-CoV-2 is significantly greater than
in a random sequence, we generated 10 random sequences with length and GC content the same as in
SARS-CoV-2. In that test, the mean PQS frequency per 1,000 nt was 0.16 with standard deviation of
0.05. We applied Wilcoxon signed-rank test with continuity correction and the resulting p-value was
0.0028. Thus, the PQS frequency per 1,000 nt in SARS-CoV-2 (0.03) is significantly lower than
expected.
All PQSs found in ranges of G4Hunter score intervals and precomputed PQS frequencies per 1,000 nt
are summarized in Table 2. The relationship between observed PQS frequency per 1,000 nucleotides
and GC content in all analyzed Nidovirales sequences is depicted in Figure 3, the Beihai Nido-like
virus has both the highest GC content and highest PQS frequency. Within Nidovirales with Humans as
host, however, the highest PQS frequency was found in Breda virus, which does not have the highest
GC content in the dataset.

Figure 4 shows the differences in PQS frequency by annotated loci. We downloaded features for every
virus genome and analyzed the presence of PQS in each annotated sequence and in its proximity (before
and after). The most notable enrichment of PQSs was located before 3′UTR, inside 5′UTR, before
mRNA, and after miscellaneous RNA. The lowest PQS frequencies were found after 3′UTR, before
5′UTR, before and inside miscellaneous RNA, and in miscellaneous features.

3.3 Variation in Frequency of Inverted Repeats in Nidovirales
To find short IRs in Nidovirales genomic sequences, we utilized the core of the Palindrome analyser
(Brázda et al., 2016). We used values for Palindrome analyser returning inverted repeats capable to
form stable hairpins (size of IRs was set to 6–30 nt, size of spacer to 1–10 nt, maximally one mismatch).
Genomic sequence sizes, total IR counts, and IR frequencies characteristics are summarized in Table
3. In total, 93,369 IRs were found and the mean IRs frequency was 33.90 per 1,000 nt. The maximal
IR frequency was found in Planarian secretory cell nidovirus (56.17), the species with the largest
genome among Nidovirales. It has been suggested that Planarian secretory cell nidovirus diverged early

from multi-ORF Nidovirales and acquired additional genes, including those typical of large DNA
viruses or hosts (RNAse T2, Ankyrin, and Fibronectin type II), which might modulate virus–host
interactions (Saberi et al., 2018). The lowest IR frequency was noticed in Beihai Nido-like virus 1
(19.23). Noteworthy is that this is the species of Nidovirales with the highest GC content and PQS
frequency. Differences in IR frequency by annotated locus are depicted in Figure 5. By families, the
highest mean IRs frequency was found in Coronaviridae (37.08) and lowest in Ronidovirineae (26.37).
Novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has relatively high IR frequency per 1,000 nt, in comparison
with other Nidovirales. To test if the frequency of IRs per 1,000 nt in SARS-CoV-2 is significantly
greater than in random sequence, we generated 10 random sequences with length and GC content the
same as in SARS-CoV-2. The mean frequency of IRs per 1,000 nt was 30.23, with standard deviation
0.22. We applied Wilcoxon signed-rank test with continuity correction to find that p-value was equal
to 0.0029. Thus, the IR frequency per 1,000 nt in SARS-CoV-2 (40.23) is significantly higher than
expected. When we inspected differences of IR frequencies according to hosts, we found the highest
mean IR frequency per 1,000 nt to be in Nidovirales infecting Humans (38.13), then in Vertebrates
(34.25), and the lowest mean frequency is in Invertebrates (31.77).

A summary of all IRs found in ranges of different IR sizes and precomputed IR frequencies per 1,000
nt is shown in Table 4. Although generally the frequency of IR presence decreases with the IR length,
there are notable differences between groups and also between viruses with different hosts. The most
as well as longest IRs occur in the Coronaviridae group and in viruses having humans as a host. IRs
12 bp long and longer are very rare in the Ronidovirineae group. The relationship between IRs length
and stability of resulting secondary structure is not simple. While some authors believe that longer IRs
are more stable, others suggest that there is an energy optimum defined by arm and spacer length
(Sinden et al., 1991; Brázda et al., 2016; Georgakopoulos-Soares et al., 2018).

Differences in IR frequency according to annotated loci are shown in Figure 5. The most notable
enrichment of IRs was found inside 5′UTR for IRs of size 12+ nt, and this is the most frequently
occurring location of 12+ IRs in Nidovirales genomes. Noteworthy is that there are no 12+ IRs around
5′UTR loci, but there is an abundance of IRs 10+ nt long in these locations. The 5′UTR are abundant
for 12+ IR, but there are no 12+ IRs within 3′UTR. This points to functional relevance of these IRs in
viral genomes.

3.4 Prediction of Human SARS-CoV-2 RNA Folding
It is very likely that coronavirus RNA in the viral capsid is compactly folded into a spiral-like structure
due to nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N, as was proposed earlier for SARS-CoV (Chang et al., 2014).
But what structure does the RNA takes after the capsid content is released into the cytoplasm of the
host cell? We made a global prediction of RNA folding for SARS-CoV-2 and in a negative control
(random RNA sequences with the same GC content and length). It was clearly visible that there arose
a much more compact RNA structure in SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 6).

3.5 Comparison of SUD Domain M Region of Nsp3 in Three Pathogenic Human
Coronaviruses
Consisting of nearly 2,000 amino acids, Nsp3 is the largest multi-domain protein in Nidovirales.
Nevertheless, Nsp3’s role is still largely unknown. It is believed that the protein plays various roles in
coronavirus infection. Nsp3 interacts with other viral Nsps as well as RNA to form the
replication/transcription complex. It also acts on posttranslational modifications of host proteins to
antagonize the host innate immune response. On the other hand, Nsp3 is itself modified in host cells
by N-glycosylation and can interact with host proteins to support virus survival (Lei et al., 2018). Both
SARS-CoVs (2003 and 2019) have the PQSs in their genomes and have a retained M region of the
SUD domain in protein Nsp3 that is reported to be critical for interacting with G-quadruplexes (Kusov
et al., 2015). MERS has no PQS in its RNA sequence and, strikingly, it has a deletion in this region of
the SUD domain suggesting parallel evolution simplifications.

al. (2015), the G-quadruplex-interacting residues K565, K568, and E571 are highlighted in green

3.6 Prediction of Human RNA-Binding Proteins Sites in SARS-CoV-2 RNA
Using the RBPmap tool, we predicted human RNA-binding proteins sites in SARS-CoV-2 RNA. While
holding to very stringent thresholds, three highly promising candidate human RNA-binding proteins
were predicted. SRSF7 was predicted to bind viral RNA in nucleotide position 26,194–26,199
(NC_045512.2), which is in fact exactly the binding motif for this protein (ACGACG). Protein
HNRNPA1 was predicted to bind viral RNA in nucleotide position 23,090–23 097 (exact binding motif
GUAGUAGU). The last protein found was TRA2A in nucleotide position 3,056–3,065 and position
3,074–3,083, in both cases with one mismatch (the motifs found were GAAGAAGAAG and the
experimentally validated motif for TRA2A is GAAGAGGAAG). All three of these proteins share
multiple RGG-rich novel interesting quadruplex interaction (NIQI) motifs, which are common to most
human G-quadruplex-binding proteins (Brázda et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2018; Masuzawa and Oyoshi,
2020). All find individual motif occurrence (FIMO) hits below p-value = 1.10-4 are enclosed in
Supplementary Material 7. The proteins SRSF7, HNRNPA1, and TRA2A are involved in mRNA
splicing via the spliceosome pathway (Szklarczyk et al., 2015).

Discussion

Local DNA structures have been shown to play important roles in basic biological processes, including
replication and transcription (Brázda et al., 2011; Travers and Muskhelishvili, 2015; Surovtsev and
Jacobs-Wagner, 2018). PQS analyses of human viruses have clearly demonstrated that these sequences
are conserved also in the viral genomes (Lavezzo et al., 2018) and could be targets for antiviral
therapies (Wang et al., 2015; Krafčíková et al., 2017; Ruggiero and Richter, 2018). For example, the
conserved PQS sequence present in the L gene of Zaire ebolavirus and related to its replication is
inhibited by interaction with G-quadruplex ligand TMPyP4, and this finding has led to suggestions that
G-quadruplex RNA stabilization could constitute a new strategy against Ebola virus disease (Wang et
al., 2016). Our results found only one PQS in the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, that having an

(where

G-quadruplex could theoretically arise). This PQS is located in the position 28,289–28,313 within the
nucleocapsid phosphoprotein coding sequence. It is noteworthy that all viral RNAs are produced
through negative-strand intermediates, which are only about 1% as abundant as their positive-sense
counterparts (Fehr and Perlman, 2015). It would be of great value to know whether TMPyP4 or other
G-quadruplex stabilizing compounds can inhibit replication processes of SARS-CoV-2. RNA hairpins,
which are formed by IRs, are basic structural elements of RNA and play crucial roles in gene expression
and intermolecular recognition. Conserved palindromic RNA structures have been found in many viral
genomes, including HIV-1, and play a crucial role in their replication (Liu et al., 2018). We have found
an abundance of IRs inside 5′UTR in Nidovirales genomes. In general, 5′UTR is an important locus
for regulation of viral replication and gene expression. It has been demonstrated that stem integrity of
phylogenetically conserved stem-loop structure located in 5′UTR of the PRRSV virus from the
Arteriviridae family is crucial for viral replication and subgenomic mRNA synthesis. Similar
secondary structures have been proposed for several viruses from the Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae
families (Lu et al., 2011). Our analyses of annotated features in Figure 5 therefore support this report.
The discrete locations of specific IRs in viral genomes could therefore be additional targets for their
regulation.
Targeting viral proteins is usually effective only against specific viral strains and fails even for closely
related viral species. It appears that targeting host proteins should be able to provide a response toward
a wider spectrum of viruses inasmuch as different viruses exploit common cellular pathways. Many

cellular RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) containing well-established RNA-binding domains (RBDs) are
known to be critical for infection by different viruses. Recently, 472 RBPs were reviewed for their
linkage to viruses (Garcia-Moreno et al., 2018). It has been demonstrated that G-quadruplex formation
in HIV-1 viral genome stalls RNA polymerase, thereby limiting viral replication in host cells. HIV-1
nucleocapsid protein NCp7 helps to resolve G-quadruplex formation and therefore enables virus to
spread. Stabilization of this quadruplex has been targeted by several experimental compounds. This
treatment slowed or inhibited viral growth (Butovskaya et al., 2019).
Virus reproduction is dependent on the cellular transcription machinery, and therefore the interaction
of the cellular proteins with viral RNA could be another target for antiviral therapy (Roberts et al.,
2009). Our analysis predicted several QBPs to be capable to bind SARS-CoV-2 RNA. One of these,
HNRNPA1 protein, is responsible for nuclear–cytoplasm shuttling (Garcia-Moreno et al., 2018). Like
some other RNA-binding proteins, HNRNPA1 forms so-called membraneless organelles. These
organelles are assemblies of proteins along with RNA or DNA that condense in specific cellular loci.
The organelles can undergo transition from liquid-like droplets to amyloid fibrils, and mutations in socalled low complexity domains of these proteins lead to formation of amyloid aggregations that are
found in many neurodegenerative diseases (Gui et al., 2019). HNRNPA1 is involved in many different
cellular processes and has been targeted in various diseases. One such example is the varicella zoster
virus that causes chicken pox. Moreover, this response to varicella zoster virus has been connected
with autoimmune disease that complicates multiple sclerosis (Kattimani and Veerappa, 2018).
HNRNPA1 is known to bind and resolve G-quadruplex formed in TRA2B promoter and to promote
its transcription. Dysregulation of this binding leads to progression of colon cancer. This interaction
has been targeted by the well-known G-quadruplex stabilizer pyridostatin, which led to decreased
transcription from the TRA2B promoter (Nishikawa et al., 2019). Furthermore, HNRNPA1 is coexpressed with bromodomain and extraterminal domain protein BRD4 in human tumor samples. It has
been shown experimentally that the well-described, naturally occurring polyphenolic flavonoid
quercetin inhibited this protein and thereby led to better susceptibility to treatment in cancer patients
(Pham et al., 2019). Both SRSF7 and TRA2A proteins, which are predicted to interact with SARSCoV-2 RNA, play roles in alternative splicing (Ghosh et al., 2016). SRSF7 is a serine and argininerich splicing factor and is part of the spliceosome. Its expression has been connected to several types
of cancer and it has been shown that its knockdown induced p21 expression and thus reduced cancer
development (Saijo et al., 2016). Little is known about TRA2A protein. It was first identified in insects
together with its paralog TRA2B, which has been studied to a greater extent (Tan et al., 2018). It has

been found that TRA2A can promote paclitaxel therapy and promote cancer progression in triplenegative breast cancers (Liu et al., 2017). A role of TRA2A protein in regulation of HIV1 virus
replication has been described. Both TRA2A and TRA2B bind to a specific HIV1 sequence and
regulate its replication within the cell through alternative splicing of viral RNA (Erkelenz et al., 2013).
Scientists around the world are united in their efforts to find an effective therapy against coronavirus
disease (COVID-19). Among the most promising candidates are remdesivir and chloroquine.
Remdesivir is an adenosine analogue that incorporates into nascent viral RNA chains and results in
premature termination. Preliminary data have shown that remdesivir effectively inhibited virus
infection in a human liver cancer cell line (Wang et al., 2020). Chloroquine is a potential broadspectrum antiviral drug and it already has been widely used as a low-cost and safe anti-malarial and
autoimmune disease drug for more than 70 years. Application of chloroquine causes elevation of
endosomal pH and also interferes with terminal glycosylation of the cellular receptor ACE2. This
probably has a negative influence on virus-receptor binding and abrogates the infection (Vincent et al.,
2005). Drug repurposing seems like a very good strategy for quickly and at low cost finding a new
therapy for new human diseases (Oprea and Mestres, 2012). To date, there are few substances with Gquadruplex stabilizing features. One example is topotecan (also known by its brand name Hycamtin®),
which frequently is used for treating ovary cancer. If everything else fails, it seems to be an option. On
the other hand, topotecan cause unpleasant side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
(Topotecan - Chemotherapy Drugs - Chemocare). Many studies have described strong G-quadruplex
stabilization effects (Li et al., 2018; Satpathi et al., 2018), which might be one possible mode of action.
Moreover, it has been proven that higher structures of nucleic acids, and G-quadruplex especially,
might be stabilized by use of various natural substances. Berbamine is one such substance and is a
component of traditional Chinese medicine. It frequently is used for treating chronic myeloid leukemia
or melanoma and has strong binding affinity to G-quadruplex structures (Tan et al., 2014). Viral nucleic
acids and their loci with G-quadruplex-forming potential are in all cases very specific and are
promising molecular targets for treating serious diseases. Evidence of G-quadruplex formation as a
potential target for therapy was proven for Hepatitis A, flu virus, and HIV-1 (Métifiot et al., 2014).
Because all the aforementioned cases concern RNA viruses, the viral G-quadruplexes are localized in
the cytoplasm of the host cell. One of the main conclusions to be drawn from this study is that
sequences able to form G-quadruplex structures in the Nidovirales (infecting human) family are very
rare, and this suggests intentional suppression during evolution to simplify viral RNA replication.
Finding the proper stabilizers of viral higher RNA structures might be crucial for inhibiting or stopping
