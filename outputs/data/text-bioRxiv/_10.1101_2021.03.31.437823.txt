Abstract
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and Diabetes mellitus affect each other
bidirectionally. The plus-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) genome of the SARS-CoV-2
virus can be targeted and suppressed by the host cell's microRNAs (miRNAs). Using the
differential gene expression analysis between the mock-infected and the SARS-CoV-2infected pancreatic tissue, we report five Diabetes-associated genes that are upregulated due
to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the hESC pancreas tissues. Ten miRNAs regulating these five
genes can potentially target the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We hypothesize that the SARS-CoV-2
genome copies in the infected human pancreas cell compete with the host cell’s native genes
in being regulated by the native miRNAs. It leads to the reduced miRNA-regulation and,
thus, the upregulation of the Diabetes-associated native genes. Thus, the resultant new-onset
or elevated Diabetic symptoms may worsen the condition of COVID-19 patients.

Introduction
Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is a fast-spreading disease that has caused a global crisis.
This pandemic is a highly infectious viral disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as novel coronavirus-2019 [1, 2].
According to the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) COVID-19 Dashboard [3],
110,749,023 cases and 2,455,131 deaths have been reported globally due to COVID-19 as of
21st February 2021. SARS-CoV-2 has a positive-sense single-stranded ribonucleic acid
(+ssRNA) genome enclosed in a protein-containing lipid bilayer [4, 5]. Its RNA genome acts
as a messenger RNA (mRNA) after entering the host cell and is directly translated by the host
cell's ribosomes, resulting in viral proteins. These translated viral proteins are also
responsible for viral RNA replication [6].
Patients having either type 1 or type 2 Diabetes mellitus (commonly referred to as Diabetes)
show poor prognosis with SARS-CoV-2 infection due to blood glucose level fluctuations and
metabolic complications. An increase in blood glucose level helps in the SARS-CoV-2
replication and proliferation in the human monocytes [5, 7]. New-onset Diabetes has also
been observed after COVID-19 infection [8]. Thus, COVID-19 severity and Diabetes affect
each other in a bidirectional manner. Moreover, the resultant hyperglycaemia can diminish
the individual’s immune response towards handling the viral infection. COVID-19 mortality
is also amplified for diabetic patients due to complications like cardiovascular diseases and
kidney-related problems [8-11]. Thus, regulating the blood glucose levels and preventing
diabetic complications is required for diabetic COVID-19 patients to avert severe
consequences of the infection on them [5].
Autopsy reports have been known to reveal COVID-19 infection in the human pancreas [12].
It becomes possible due to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the
pancreas cells. ACE2 acts as a very high-affinity receptor on the cell for the spike protein of
SARS-CoV-2 [13, 14]. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an essential role in the regulation of
gene expression in a cell. In a virus-infected cell, the host cell's miRNAs help in cell defense
by targeting the viral RNA genome or its transcribed RNAs. In humans, the miRNAs mostly
target the 3'UTR of the mRNAs. However, the miRNAs primarily target the 3'UTR and
5'UTR of the viral RNA genomes. During a viral infection, the host cell's miRNAs may target
the viral genome rather than the native mRNAs. It leads to a competition for miRNA
regulation between the host cell’s mRNAs and the viral genome copies in the cell. This

differential targeting of the miRNAs may result in the dysregulation of the host cell's genes
[15-18].
In this study, we hypothesize the link between Diabetes and COVID-19 through differential
targeting of the miRNAs in the Pancreas tissue. The disease enrichment based on differential
gene expression analysis revealed pancreas- and diabetes-associated terms. We identified the
miRNAs that can potentially target the SARS-CoV-2 genome as well as the Diabetesassociated genes upregulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected pancreas tissue.

Materials and Methods
Differential gene expression analysis – The RNA-Seq gene expression data for mockinfected and SARS-CoV-2-infected hESC pancreatic tissue were retrieved from NCBI. For
the study, three mock-infected and three SARS-CoV-2-infected hESC pancreatic tissue
samples were chosen from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset accession,
GSE151803 [19]. The Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) between the mock-infected
and the SARS-CoV-2-infected pancreatic tissue were obtained using the DESeq2 R package
(padj < 0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) [20, 21].
Disease enrichment analysis – DEGs-based disease enrichment analysis was done through
DAVID – Functional Annotation Tool considering the Gene-Disease Associations Dataset
(GAD) [22, 23]. The pancreas-associated diseases and the DEGs associated with them were
selected for further studies. A literature search was done for the obtained DEGs to understand
their role in the respective diseases.
Gene-gene interaction network – The gene-gene interaction (GGI) network of the DEGs
was created using the Cytoscape-GeneMANIA app [24-26]. Network topological analysis
was done using the Cytoscape-NetworkAnalyzer plugin [27] to get an insight about the
influence of the genes in the network.
Differentially targeting miRNAs – The complete genome reference sequence of SARSCoV-2, Wuhan-Hu-1, was retrieved from NCBI RefSeq ID, NC_045512.2 [28]. The 3'UTR
and 5'UTR of the viral genome were obtained. The human miRNAs targeting the 3' and 5'
UTR of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (CoV-tar-miRNAs) were obtained using the miRDB

online tool [29, 30]. The target genes of CoV-tar-miRNAs were obtained using the Predicted
Target Module of miRWalk 2.0 [31, 32].
Diabetes-linked CoV-tar-miRNAs – The target genes of the CoV-tar-miRNAs were
compared to the enriched Diabetes-associated genes. The genes common in both were those
Diabetes-associated genes that may get upregulated in pancreas cells due to miRNAs'
differential targeting during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, the availability of miRNAs
in the pancreas tissue was checked from the web-based repository, Tissue-Atlas [33].

Results
Differential Gene Expression between mock-infected and SARS-CoV-2-infected
pancreatic tissue – Using the DESeq2 R package, 30 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
between the mock-infected and SARS-CoV-2-infected pancreatic tissues of the GEO dataset
GSE151803 were revealed [19-21]. 26 DEGs were upregulated and 4 DEGs were
downregulated (Table 1) in the SARS-CoV-2-infected hESC pancreas tissue.
Disease enrichment of DEGs – DAVID Tool was used for DEGs-based disease enrichment
analysis based on the Gene-Disease Associations Dataset (GAD) [22, 23]. Gene-based
disease enrichment of the 30 DEGs resulted in Type I Diabetes as the most significant GAD
disease. It was linked to four upregulated DEGs, i.e., CP, SOCS3, AGT and PSMB8 (Table
2). Two upregulated DEGs, CP and CFB were enriched for the term "insulin." COVID-19
has been linked with the other resultant disease terms, but only the terms associated with the
pancreas were selected for the study.
Gene-Gene interaction (GGI) network – The Cytoscape-GeneMANIA [24-26] GGI
network of the DEGs contains 29 genes as HCP5 is a lncRNA, and its data is not present in
GeneMANIA. Diabetes-associated (Type 1 Diabetes and insulin-associated) DEGs are
connected directly or indirectly through co-expression (Figure 1, Table 3). Two
downregulated DEGs, i.e., AKR1B10 and PKHD1L1, show interaction with the upregulated
DEGs (Figure 1, Table 4).
After removing the duplicate edges between the gene nodes, the network's topological
parameters were calculated (Table 5). Closeness centralities of the SUCNR1 and TACR1
genes were ignored due to their interaction with each other only and not with the significant

network. The Diabetes-associated gene CP has the highest closeness and betweenness
centrality; thus, it is the most influential gene in the network. The CFB gene is the secondhighest diabetes-associated gene in terms of closeness centrality.
3'UTR and 5'UTR of the viral genome – The SARS-CoV-2 genome consists of a linear
29903 nucleotides long ss-RNA [28]. The 3'UTR of the genome is 229 nucleotides long,
including a polyA tail. It lies in the viral genome at the position from 29675 to 29903
nucleotides. The 5'UTR of the genome is 265 nucleotides long and spans from 1 to 265
nucleotides in the viral genome. Both 3'UTR and 5'UTR of the SARS-CoV-2 genome

miRNAs targeting the UTRs of the viral genome – Using miRWalk 2.0 online tool [31,
32], 10 and 11 miRNAs, i.e., CoV-tar-miRNAs, were found to be potentially targeting the
3'UTR (Table 6) and 5'UTR (Table 7) of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, respectively.
CoV-tar-miRNAs targeting Diabetes-associated DEGs – Each of the five Diabetesassociated DEGs was found to be targeted by one or more CoV-tar-miRNAs. Eight 3'UTR
and nine 5'UTR CoV-tar-miRNAs were found to be potentially targeting the Diabetesassociated DEGs, respectively. Availability and raw microarray expression of five 3'UTR and
six 5'UTR CoV-tar-miRNAs in the human pancreas were obtained from the TissueAtlas webbased repository. Due to the microarray expression data’s unavailability in TissueAtlas, hsamiR-466, hsa-miR-3123, hsa-miR-4691-3p, hsa-miR-3941, hsa-miR-6749-3p and hsa-miR7851-3p were not considered for further study. hsa-mir-4775 has a negative raw microarray

expression value in the human pancreas; thus, it was also not considered for differential
targeting analysis. Four 3'UTR and six 5'UTR CoV-tar-miRNAs are expressed in the human
pancreas (Table 8).

Discussion
The SARS-CoV-2 infection has been detected in many different human organs, including the
pancreas. The viral infection may lead to dysregulation of genes in the infected cells. 26 and
4 genes were found to be upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in the SARS-CoV-2infected hESC pancreas tissue. Among them, five upregulated genes, i.e., CP, SOCS3, AGT,
PSMB8, and CFB, are associated with Diabetes (Type 1 Diabetes or insulin). Among the
genes associated with other enriched diseases, six upregulated genes, i.e., CP, AGT, CFB,
SERPINA3, CXCL2, and C8B, encode for proteins that are secreted to blood. These proteins
may also reach other organs of the body, thus, being involved in other diseases. Their roles in
other diseases must be further investigated. Diabetes can result in Nephropathy or Macular
Degeneration [34-36]; therefore, they can be the indirect results of COVID-19.
The human miRNAs mostly target the 3'UTR of the mRNAs in the cytoplasm of the cell.
However, they primarily target the 3'UTR and 5'UTR of the infecting viral RNA genome. It
has been seen that the SARS-CoV-2 virus also infects the pancreas, among other organs of
the human body. Since it is a +ss-RNA genome virus, its genome itself acts as an mRNA.
Thus, the pancreas cell's miRNAs must target the viral 3'UTR or 5'UTR, causing them to
deflect from regulating the pancreas host cell's native genes. This may cause the upregulation
of the host cell's native genes. Twenty-one human miRNAs (CoV-tar-miRNAs) were found
to be potentially targeting the UTRs of the viral genome. Considering the availability of these
miRNAs in the human pancreas tissue, 10 of them also target the Diabetes-associated genes,
thus, keeping their expression in check before the infection. After infection, the SARS-CoV-2
genome competes with the mRNAs of these genes in being targeted and regulated by the
miRNAs. This differential targeting of the miRNAs explains the upregulation of the
Diabetes-associated genes after the viral infection (Figure 2).
The SOCS3 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3) gene codes for a protein that helps regulate
cytokine signal transduction [37]. It is the potential target of four 3’UTR CoV-tar-miRNAs,
i.e., hsa-miR-1236-3p, hsa-miR-4279, hsa-miR-4717-3p and hsa-miR-5088-5p, and two

5’UTR CoV-tar-miRNAs, i.e., hsa-miR-1303 and hsa-miR-3925-5p. Thus, SOCS3
upregulation after the viral infection may be due to the differential targeting of these
miRNAs. Overexpression of SOCS3 has been observed in mice having Type 1 Diabetes.
SOCS3-deficiency in pancreas beta cells is associated with increased resistance to apoptosis,
thus, preventing Type 1 Diabetes [38]. However, in the SARS-CoV-2- infected Pancreas
tissue, the expression of SOCS3 may be increased due to differential targeting of miRNAs;
thus, it decreases the beta cells' resistance to the development of Diabetes.
The PSMB8 gene is the potential target of three 3'UTR CoV-tar-miRNAs, i.e., hsa-miR1236-3p, hsa-miR-4279 and hsa-miR-5088-5p, and two 5'UTR CoV-tar-miRNAs, i.e., hsamiR-3925-5p and hsa-miR-298. PSMB8 codes for Proteasome 20S Subunit Beta 8 and has
been found to promote apoptosis [39, 40]. Its upregulation may also contribute to the
apoptosis of the pancreas' beta cells.
The CP gene is the potential target of two 5'UTR CoV-tar-miRNAs, i.e., hsa-miR-4747-5p
and hsa-miR-5196-5p. The CP gene encodes a secretory plasma protein called
Ceruloplasmin, the level of which is found to be increased in the Diabetic condition [41]. CP
has the highest closeness and betweenness centrality, indicating its strong influence on the
network.
The CFB gene encodes for the secretory complement factor b, which links obesity to
Diabetes. Its level is found to be increased during obesity. It is also linked to insulin
resistance [42]. Although in our study, CFB gene expression does not seem to be affected by
differential miRNAs targeting, its upregulation is linked with the upregulation of CP, SOCS3,
and AGT genes as all these genes are co-expressed according to the gene-gene interaction
network (Figure 1).
The AGT gene is the potential target of three 5'UTR CoV-tar-miRNAs, i.e., hsa-miR-1303,
hsa-miR-298, and hsa-miR-4645-3p. AGT gene encodes for the secretory preangiotensinogen or angiotensinogen precursor, which is essential for the renin-angiotensin
system to maintain the blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis in the body [43,
44].
Our study suggests that after SARS-CoV-2 infection, these genes associated with Diabetes
and cell death get upregulated due to differential miRNA targeting and lead the pancreas cells
to death. This hypothesis can be applied to the insulin-producing pancreas beta cells,

resulting in low or no insulin secretion. This can worsen the condition of COVID-19 patients
due to diabetic complications or new onset of Diabetes, even if the pancreas cell's miRNAs
block the viral genome function. The mechanism of differential miRNA targeting must be
further validated in vitro. For therapeutic purposes, artificial miRNAs can be designed and
inserted into the infected cells to bind with the viral genome, thus, blocking both its function
as well as the differential targeting of the host cell's miRNAs. A research study with this
concept has been done with four artificial miRNAs for targeting and blocking the
Chikungunya virus genome [45].

Conclusion
This study suggests that in a SARS-CoV-2-infected human pancreas cell, the native miRNAs
target the viral genome instead of the cell’s mRNAs that were being targeted before the
infection. This differential miRNA targeting causes the pancreas cell’s genes associated with
Diabetes to upregulate, leading to diabetic complications or even new onset of Diabetes.
Preventive, therapeutic methods are needed to block the viral genome from binding the host
cell's miRNAs and facilitate binding with the externally provided artificial miRNAs.

Figure 2. Differential targeting of the host cell’s native miRNAs –
(a) The cell’s native miRNAs regulate the genes by targeting and
suppressing the cell’s native mRNAs only. (b) In a SARS-CoV-2infected cell, the viral +ssRNA genome copies compete with the host
cell’s native mRNAs in being targeted by the native miRNAs. The
native miRNAs get apportioned in targeting the SARS-CoV-2
genome copies too. It reduces the contribution of miRNAs in
regulating the native cell’s genes, thus, upregulating them.
