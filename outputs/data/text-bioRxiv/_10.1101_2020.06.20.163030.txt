Abstract
Recently, there are several routes for COVID-19 vaccine research, yet their weaknesses lie
in low efficiency, tolerability, immune adaptability and safety. We describe a new approach to
COVID-19 based on engineered human mesenchymal stem cells(hu-MSC), which is like a small
protein antigen response device, but will be gradually cleared and degraded by body’s immune
system among recognization process. The antibody response results show that this is effective and
fast. Furthermore, after several antibody response tests, we obtained an injection of a set of
cocktail-like modified human mesenchymal stem cell line. This strategy opened a new avenue for
vaccine design against COVID-19.
Introduction

The pandemic of COVID-19 has spread around the world and vaccines become the
main means for fighting of COVID-19[1-3]. At present, hundreds of vaccines are under
the pipeline including traditional attenuated/inactivated vaccine, nucleic acid-based
vaccine (DNA and RNA[4]), and protein vaccine[5-7]. Each of these vaccines has their
own advantages and disadvantages[8-11], but the vast majority of vaccines need to be
repeatedly injected to immunize the body, during the response period some causes the
body's uncomfortable symptoms. Some lack the modification happened in vivo during
virus replication. Until today it’s not clear whether the vaccines developed so far will
be successful or not, since none of the vaccines had been developed for other human

coronavirus. Therefore, the development of a safe and effective vaccine may be a key
to control the COVID outbreak and future novel coronavirus[1,

10]

. Here we

demonstrated the modified MSCs expressing SARS-CoV-2 proteins can be used as a
novel vaccine platform.
Results and discussion

Firstly, we took advantage of allogenic mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that are
widely used in transplantation-based cell therapy[12]. Human umbilical cord derived
MSCs were isolated and evaluated with MSCs typical features characterized by FACS
and functional assay (data not shown). Then primary MSCs at passage four were
transfected with plasmid expressing nucleocapsid (N) protein, the structural protein
showed dominant and long-lasting immune response reported for SARS-CoV (outbreak
in 2003)[13]. Expression was evaluated and transfection efficiency was approximately
20% on average after 48 hours of transfection. The MSC-SARS-CoV-2-N cells were
used for mice injection. In total one million modified MSCs were injected per mice
(C57BL/6) via intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SC) routes, respectively, to allow
vaccine antigens being produced in vivo (Figure 1).
The results showed that after 20 days, almost all the immunized mice had antibody
production in serum (7/8), and at least 50% of the mice showed strong positive antibody
expression followed by IM or SC injections with one dose injection (Figure 2). The
response for IM or SC injection was comparably judged by ELISA and with similar
efficiency. Control mice injected with empty vector did not show anti-N response, and
the ELISA signal is comparable to background with none-injected mice (Figure 2). We
did not observe any severer symptoms from the injected mice after any injection. And
the body weight of mice during this study were remained stable or increased. Successful
antibody response might due to the adaptive immunity promotion effect of MSCs
described before[14]. We then co-transfected the S, N and M, the structure proteins of
SARS-CoV-2, and observed elevated antibody response for N protein again. Due to
lack of good antibodies used for ELISA for S and M protein, we were not able to
evaluate the effect of these two antibody responses. And potential more elevated signal
should be obtained by multiple injections.

One potential risk for cell-based vaccine is that residual cells in the body might
cause uncontrolled proliferation and malignancy. PCR for N gene sequence and human
gene sequence were performed in blood and tissues from injected region, and no
positive signal was detected, indicating that the MSCs were cleared by immune system
after 20 days of injection (data not shown).
The research and development route based on stem cells proposed in this report can
realize the presentation of antigen proteins of multiple targets by virtue of the feature
of presenting and secreting part of the novel coronavirus antigen protein. Most
importantly, some of the novel coronavirus proteins mediated and secreted by stem cells
will be modified, like glycosylation[15] and acetylation, mimicking the virus protein
modification in vivo, which can well simulate response increase the success rate of onetime immunity[16]. It was reported that mice strains maintained in the laboratory are not
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection[17], due to the variation of ACE2 receptor for
virus entry[18, 19]. Later other model animals[20] like dogs and monkeys are needed to
further test the efficiency and performance of stem cell vaccine. To our knowledge, this
is the first report on a novel vaccine against COVID-19 based on stem cell as a platform.
Combined with the advantages of mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of diseases
[21]

, we believe that such stem cells or cell-based vaccines will be a promising strategy

to control COVID-19 and other coronavirus with unknown potential risk[22], and it is
also a promising model for some pandemic disease.
Materials and Methods

Animal

All mice in our experiment were provided by Changsheng Animal Research Institute
in Liaoning Province, and Male and female C57BL/6 mice (4-8 weeks old) were used
for immune injection. Animal works were approved by ethical committee of Shenyang
University of Chemical Technology.
Hu-MSC cell isolation

The fresh umbilical cord tissue was cut into some pieces and isolated enzymatically
in an incubation solution of 10mL Trypsin-EDTA (Cat: 25200-072, Gibco) for 40 min
at 37℃. The digestion homogenate was stopped by 10mL DMEM/F12(Cat:11039-021,
Gibco) with 10% FBS (10099141C, Gibco) and then slightly decentralized 30-40 times

through 1-mL pipette tips. Finally, all cell solution was filtered by 100 µm cell strainer
(Cat: 352360, Corning FALCON) into a new centrifugal tube, and the P0 hu-MSC was
isolated.
Generation of vectored antigen protein by eukaryotic expressing system

Refferring to the SARS-COV-2 virus genome sequence from Wuhan-Hu-1
annotated in Genebank (locus:NC_045512.2 or MN908947)[23], we synthesized the
spike gene, membrane gene and nucleocapsid gene in gene synthesis company
(GENEWIZ, china). In terms of S type and N type plasmids, these long gene sequences
containing enzyme sites firstly was amplified by common PCR by Q5 high-fidelity PCR
kit (Cat: #M0491, NEB), using primer F and R pairs of S or N. Subsequencely, these
amplication products were added to the linear eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1flag, by the way of the restrictive enzyme digestion-ligation. However, since the M gene
was limited by the above selecting restriction sites, such as NotI and Xbal, we chaged
the homologous recombination method. A third M type primers were used to amplify
the M sequence carrying the linear vector's arms. The PCR product was purified and
directly recombined by the EasyGeno recombinant clone kits (Cat:VI201, Tiangen).
After conventional transformation and monoclonal screening of positive bacteria, we
obtained the correct plasmids construction. Finally, the plasmid construct were purified
by OMEGA Free- endotoxin extraction kits (Cat: D6950, OMEGA), and eluted in the
RNase-free water. All primers were as follows:
S-FP: 5’-GGGCGGCCGCCCTTTGTTTTTCTTGTTTTATTGC-3’；
S-RP: 5’-CCCTCTAGAGCTTATGTGTAATGTAATTTGACTC-3’；
N-FP: 5’-GGGCGGCCGCCCTCTGATAATGGACCCCA-3’；
N-RP: 5’-CCCTCTAGATTAGGCCTGAGTTGAGTC-3’；
M-FP: 5’-GACGACAAGGGGCGGCCGCAAGCAGATTCCAACGGTACTAT-3’；
M-RP: 5’-TTTAAACGGGCCCTCTAGATTACTGTACAAGCAAAGCAAT-3’.
Cell culture, Plasmid transfection and MSC-vaccine preparation

All human mesenchymal stem cells were cultured in free serum medium (Cat:
SC2013-G-A, AM-V serum free medium) supplement with related cytokines and 1%
pennicillin-streptomycin (Cat:MA0110, Meilunbio). These cells were refreshed

medium or passaged every three days. In our experiments, we usually choose the fourth
or sixth passage of hu-MSC for transfection. Due to the difficulty of transfection, we
adopted the method of electro-transfection to deliver the plasmids into hu-MSC. After
transfection, the MSC plates were incubated at 37℃ with 5% CO2.
When the engineered hu-MSC cultured until 48 hours post-transfection, the
adherent MSC were digested using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and cell pellets were harvested.
The modified hu-MSCs were resuspended with PBS and counted to make dilutions to
form proper concentration.
Engineered hu-MSC injection and in vivo immunization

An equal amount of male and female C57BL/6 mice, aged from six to eight weeks,
were taken. Then, the mice were randomly divided into two groups, according to the
two injection ways (intravenous and subculaneous). For example, the right hind leg of
the mice was sterilized by 75% alcohol and injected 1 million modified MSC through
1 ml injector for intramuscular, and choosing the side abdomen or neck locus were for
subcutanous injection (SI). Briefly, no matter what kinds of injection, we would use 1
million engineered hu-MSC for vaccination.
FACS analysis

To evaluate the feasibility of the transfection condition, we delivered a plasmid
carrying GFP as a reporter to hu-MSC though electro-transfection, and the transfection
efficiency was measured by flow cytometry (FACS). Generally, we added 0.25%
Trypsin-EDTA about 500 µl to one well of six-well plate, digested and separated,
harvested cell pellet. Then, the cells were resuspended with appropriate PBS buffer, and
filtered through a 100 µm strainer for detection on flow cytometer.
ELISA analysis for antibody

Blood sample were taken from the mice for serological test, after 20 days of
vaccination. Meanwhile, we randomly selected 5-8 wild mice without any treatment
from the same batch of mice before injection, and their serum were performed as
negative controls. We assessed the ability of mice to produce antibodies against
nucleocapsid protein by ELISA analysis. ELISA 96 well plates were coated with
specific antigen protein (the dilution ratio: 1/20-30), which manufactured by Beijing
sino biological(cat:40589-v08B1). Then, sample diluent 100 µl and every sample serum

5 µl were added to each well of 96 well plate, and incubated at 37℃ for 60 min. After
1 hour incubation, solution was discarded and the plate was washed by PBS for 5 times.
The secondary HRP-labeled Goat Anti-mouse IgG(H+L) (Cat:A0216，Beyotime) at
the dilution ratio of 1 to 10000 was added to each well and incubated at 37℃ for 30min.
The same washing was performed for 5 times. After TMB (Cat:ST746, Beyotime) was
added for color development for 15min, absorbance was detected under 450nm
condition via Multiscan Spectrum when added with stopping buffer.
Statistical analysis

For gene sequence, we successively adopt SnapGene to analysis the sequencing
results. Then, we used Graphpad Prism V5.0 analysis for the group values to draw the
graph, and from which experimental data were presented as the mean ± SD and analyzed
by the unpaired Student’s t test.(P<0.05 was considered statistically significant).
