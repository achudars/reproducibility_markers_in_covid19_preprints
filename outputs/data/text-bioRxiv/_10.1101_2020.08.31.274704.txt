Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via ACE-2, which binds the spike protein with moderate

21

affinity. Despite a constant background mutational rate, the virus must retain binding with ACE2

22

for infectivity, providing a conserved constraint for SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. To prevent

23

mutational escape of SARS-CoV-2 and to prepare for future related coronavirus outbreaks, we

24

engineered a de novo trimeric ACE2 (T-ACE2) protein scaffold that binds the trimeric spike

25

protein with extremely high affinity (KD < 1 pM), while retaining ACE2 native sequence. T-

26

ACE2 potently inhibits all tested pseudotyped viruses including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV,

27

eight naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 mutants, two SARSr-CoVs as well as authentic SARS-

28

CoV-2. The cryo-EM structure reveals that T-ACE2 can induce the transit of spike protein to

29

“three-up” RBD conformation upon binding. T-ACE2 thus represents a promising class of

30

broadly neutralizing proteins against SARS-CoVs and mutants.

31

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a severe global

32

pandemic. Following SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is yet another emergent beta-coronavirus

33

threatening human health 1. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (SARS-CoVs) are very similar by

34

sharing 79.5% sequence identity 1, similar spike protein structures 2-4 and same cell surface

35

receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) 1,5. However, seventeen years after the severe

36

acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic, no targeted vaccines or therapeutics have been

37

approved for SARS, some of which might have held promise for treating COVID-19. Many

38

neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are currently being urgently developed 6-10, and

39

some of these might become available later this year or next year. However, RNA viruses are

40

known to have higher mutation rates 11,12. Many SARS-CoV-2 mutations have already been

41

identified such as D614G 13-16. This means that resultant mutation strains could make current

42

SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies ineffective in the future. The appearance of COVID-19

43

after SARS indicates the likely emergence of other coronavirus pandemics in the future. Thus,

44

therapeutics broadly effective against SARS-CoV-2 and mutants, even other SARS-CoV-2-

45

related coronaviruses, are highly desirable. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind ACE2 for

46

cell entry, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 mutants and future related coronaviruses are also likely

47

to bind ACE2. Therefore, proteins engineered based on wild-type ACE2 could serve as the most

48

broadly neutralizing proteins against these viruses and will be least likely to face mutational

49

escape.

50

The biological function of ACE2 further supports using ACE2 decoy proteins to treat

51

patients infected with SARS-CoVs. Coronavirus infection, or even spike protein binding, can

52

cause shedding of ACE2 from cell surface resulting in a decreased level of ACE2 expression and

53

accumulation of plasma angiotensin II 17-19. This phenomenon is closely related to acute lung

54

injury 17,20-22. Replenishing soluble ACE2 could alleviate acute respiratory distress syndrome

55

(ARDS) 17,21-23. In fact, it has been shown that recombinant soluble ACE2 could inhibit infection

56

from SARS-CoVs in cell assays and organoids 24-26. One clinical trial (NCT04335136) was also

57

registered to use recombinant ACE2 to treat COVID-19. However, recombinant soluble ACE2

58

inhibits viral infection at relatively high concentrations 24,26-28, therefore, it may not be an optimal

59

inhibitor. Engineered ACE2 bearing multiple mutations and ACE2-Ig have better spike protein

60

binding affinities and better virus inhibition activities 25,27-29. Since spike proteins of SARS-CoVs

61

function as trimers 2-4, we reasoned that an engineered trimeric ACE2 protein could potentially

2

62

bind up to three receptor binding domains (RBD) on the spike protein, which would dramatically

63

increase binding affinity through avidity and thus potently inhibit SARS-CoVs (fig. S1).

64

To develop such trimeric ACE2 proteins, we chose a C-terminal domain of T4 fibritin

65

(foldon) 30,31, or a three helix bundle (3HB) 32,33, as trimerization motifs since these have been

66

successfully demonstrated to form stable protein trimers 3,30,31. We then looked at the reported

67

SARS-CoVs spike protein structures to determine the most appropriate linker between

68

trimerization motifs and ACE2 3,34-38. It has been found that SARS-CoV spike protein mostly

69

adopts one- or two-up RBD conformations and can engage one or two ACE2 monomers 34,35. On

70

the other hand, a very small population of SARS-CoV spike protein can have three-up RBD

71

conformation to bind three ACE2 monomers. SARS-CoV-2 structures mostly have closed

72

conformation or one RBD in the up position 3,36,37. From these structural analyses, we estimated

73

that distances between RBDs on the same spike protein could range from 60 Å to 100 Å when

74

they are in the up positions. Moreover, structures from SARS-CoV viral particle revealed there

75

are about 100 spike protein trimers displayed on the 100 nm diameter viral particle surface

76

giving interspike protein distance around 200 Å 4,39,40. To retain the possibility for intraspike or

77

interspike avidity, we chose a flexible (GGGGS)5 linker, or a more rigid (EAAAK)5 linker, to

78

construct trimeric ACE2 41. We used wild-type ACE2 peptidase domain (1-615) to construct all

79

trimeric ACE2 decoy proteins. Linkers were inserted after ACE2, followed by the trimerization

80

motifs. We therefore constructed four trimeric ACE2 proteins: ACE2-flexible-3HB, ACE2-rigid-

81

3HB, ACE2-flexible-foldon and ACE2-rigid-foldon. In addition, we constructed two trimeric

82

ACE2 proteins with a short linker GGGS (ACE2-short-3HB, ACE2-short-foldon) and a

83

monomeric ACE2 as control proteins (fig. S2).

84
85

Results

86

We first used ELISA assay to determine binding affinities between ACE2 proteins and the

87

prefusion stabilized trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomain (S-ECD) (Fig. 1) 3. ACE2

88

monomer binds S-ECD with IC50 of 27 nM. For trimeric ACE2 proteins, we saw significant

89

binding affinity enhancement. We found that the rigid linker constructs had the highest binding

90

affinities, including ACE2-rigid-3HB and ACE2-rigid-foldon, which both bound S-ECD with

91

IC50 of 30 pM. Trimeric ACE2 proteins with short linkers had lower binding affinities (fig. S3).

92

We further analyzed ACE2 proteins binding using biolayer interferometry (ForteBio Octet

93

RED96) (Fig. 1). S-ECD was biotinylated with NHS-PEG8-Biotin and was loaded on

94

streptavidin coated sensors at about 25% saturation to avoid artificial intermolecular avidity,

95

followed by titration of engineered ACE2 decoy proteins as analytes. KD for ACE2 monomer/S-

96

ECD was 25 nM, agreeing very well with previously published results 3. For trimeric ACE2

97

proteins, we again observed dramatically increased binding affinities. KD for ACE2-flexible-

98

3HB/S-ECD was 4.4 nM while KD for ACE2-flexible-foldon/S-ECD went down to 0.34 nM.

99

Both ACE2-rigid-3HB and ACE2-rigid-foldon bound S-ECD extremely tight, with KD < 1 pM.

100

Further decreasing loading of S-ECD on streptavidin sensors did not affect ACE2 proteins

101

binding, suggesting intramolecular avidity binding between trimeric ACE2s and S-ECD (fig.

102

S4). The massive binding affinity enhancement for ACE2-rigid-3HB and ACE2-rigid-foldon

103

also indicates that spike protein probably has at least two RBDs in the up position upon binding.

104

Next, we assessed the inhibitory activities of these trimeric ACE2 decoy proteins using

105

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudotyped viruses in an infection assay of Huh-7 cells (Fig. 2).

106

ACE2 monomer can only inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus at high concentration with

107

IC50 > 50 nM. As expected, trimeric ACE2 with flexible linkers showed much better inhibitory

108

activities. ACE2-flexible-3HB inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection with IC50 of 3.46 nM, while

109

ACE2-flexible-foldon had better inhibitory activity with IC50 of 1.58 nM. Rigid-linker trimeric

110

ACE2 proteins again displayed the highest inhibitory activities. ACE2-rigid-3HB and ACE2-

111

rigid-foldon showed similar IC50’s of 0.40 nM and 0.48 nM, respectively. Short-linker trimeric

112

ACE2 proteins showed no dramatically improved inhibitory activities compared with ACE2

113

monomer, even though they have higher binding affinities than ACE2 monomer (fig. S5).

114

Similar results were observed with SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus inhibition. (Fig. 2). ACE2

115

monomer had weak inhibitory activity with IC50 > 50 nM, while ACE2-rigid-foldon had the best

116

inhibitory activity with IC50 of 2.41 nM. Thus, the ACE2-rigid-foldon construct is the most

117

potent trimeric ACE2, which is designated T-ACE2 hereafter.

118

We then asked whether T-ACE2 could also inhibit SARS-CoV-2 mutants and related

119

coronaviruses (Fig. 2). We tested T-ACE2 inhibitory activities on eight naturally occurring

120

SARS-CoV-2 mutants, including seven RBD domain mutations 14,16, D614G mutation 13 and two

121

SARSr-CoVs (WIV1 and Rs3367). We found that T-ACE2 could potently inhibit all these

122

viruses at low nM to sub-nM IC50 concentrations (Fig. 2). Future identified novel mutations and

4

123

related coronaviruses are unlikely to escape ACE2. The observed inhibitory activities prompt us

124

to speculate T-ACE2 will have a high probability to inhibit many of these novel mutants if not

125

all.

126

We further tested T-ACE2 inhibition of authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus (Fig. 3). Vero E6 cells

127

were infected with authentic SARS-CoV-2, and inhibitory efficacy was then evaluated using

128

quantitative real-time (qPCR) and confirmed with visualization of virus nucleoprotein (N

129

protein) through immunofluorescence microscopy. Importantly, we found that T-ACE2 could

130

also potently inhibit authentic SARS-CoV-2 with IC50 of 1.88 nM, which agreed well with our

131

binding affinity and pseudotyped virus inhibition results.

132

We hypothesized that properly designed trimeric ACE2 might engage more than one

133

RBDs from the trimeric spike protein and thus dramatically increase binding affinity through

134

avidity effect. To further test this hypothesis, we cleaved off T-ACE2 C-terminal tag using

135

HRV3C protease, incubated with S-ECD and determined the complex structure using cryo-

136

electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (fig. S6-S8). For simplicity, we still kept the same name T-

137

ACE2 for the C-terminal tag cleaved protein.

138

Strikingly, in the complex, the spike protein adopts only one conformation: the “three-up”

139

RBD conformation. The complex has a nearly perfect three-fold symmetry. Most importantly, all

140

three RBDs bind to three ACE2s simultaneously. (Fig. 4). The binding interactions between

141

ACE2 and RBD are essentially the same as previous studies, and the three copies from the

142

complex align quite well (fig. S8-S9) 42,43. Although we couldn’t observe the linker and the

143

trimerization motif, we are relatively confident that the three ACE2s binding to the same spike

144

protein are from the same trimer because of the binding affinity data and virus inhibition data.

145

This spike protein conformation is very different from the previously reported prefusion

146

stabilized spike protein structures where only one or no RBD is in the up position. Recent

147

complex structures between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2 monomer from preprints

148

indicate that monomer ACE2 binding can induce conformational changes of spike protein and

149

that some spike protein can have two or three RBDs in the up position to bind up to three ACE2s

150

44,45

151

indeed, be induced by our trimeric ACE2.

152
153

. In our structure, the unique “three-up” RBD conformation in all the spike proteins should,
The distance between the C-terminal end of the three ACE2s is around 110 Å (Fig. 4). If the

trimerization motif sits right in the center, then the ideal linker length between trimerization

154

motif and ACE2 would be around 60 Å, which corresponds to the length of the (GGGGS)3

155

linker. Thus, the (GGGGS)5 flexible linker in some of our designed proteins is long enough for

156

three ACE2s to bind, but is not optimal. The more rigid (EAAAK)5 linker is shorter than

157

(GGGGS)5 and can effectively separate different functional domains of fusion proteins 46. We

158

think the effective length of the (EAAAK)5 linker is probably around 60 Å, making it an optimal

159

linker for T-ACE2. The rigid nature of this (EAAAK)5 linker probably helps to orient ACE2

160

right around RBD for immediate rebinding even if one ACE2 monomer from T-ACE2

161

dissociates from the spike protein.

162

164

Discussion
Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, tremendous efforts have been made to

165

develop therapeutics, especially those that utilize neutralizing antibodies. However, the

166

widespread and ongoing crisis of COVID-19 indicates that SARS-CoV-2 will not soon be

167

eliminated, making it prudent to anticipate future mutations notably obviating any current

168

neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, the emergence of COVID-19 after SARS suggests that related

169

coronavirus pandemics might happen in the future. Such events call for therapeutic approaches

170

widely useful for current and future related coronaviruses and mutants.

171

Several engineered ACE2 proteins bearing different number of mutations and their Ig fusion

172

proteins have been shown to increase spike protein binding affinities and virus inhibitory

173

activities, albeit with reduced or loss of catalytic activities 28,47. ACE2-Ig fusion proteins and

174

neutralizing antibodies potentially could have antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect to

175

facilitate virus infection, although such phenomenon still needs further clinical studies 48,49. Here,

176

we engineered trimeric ACE2 proteins based on wild-type ACE2 and showed that T-ACE2 could

177

bind spike protein with extremely high affinity to potently inhibit all tested pseudotyped viruses

178

including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, eight naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 mutants, two

179

SARSr-CoVs as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2. The rigid linker employed in T-ACE2 was

180

previously injected into mice and didn’t seem to show strong immunogenicity 50. The 3HB and

181

foldon trimerization motifs have been observed to cause immunogenicity, but the introduction of

182

glycans could silence the immunogenicity without disrupting the trimer formation 51. Carrying

183

these advancements a few steps beyond, the modular design of T-ACE2 demonstrates that other

6

184

oligomerization motifs and linkers could be further explored to improve properties of T-ACE2 or

185

higher oligomeric ACE2s.

186

We demonstrated that T-ACE2 could induce the transit of spike protein to a unique “three-

187

up” RBD conformation and bind all three RBDs simultaneously. Whether this T-ACE2-induced

188

spike protein conformation change represents a transition state during virus infection cannot be

189

definitively answered here. Full-length ACE2 protein functions as a dimer 42, the two monomers

190

from this ACE2 dimer are related by two-fold symmetry. They are also situated close in space,

191

with the distance between D615 being about 53 Å. Thus, the native dimeric ACE2 is unlikely to

192

engage more than one RBD from the same spike protein without substantial conformational

193

changes. It is however possible that ACE2 dimers on the cell surface might further cluster to

194

induce more RBDs to adopt up conformation and help virus to transit from the prefusion state to

195

the postfusion state.

196

ACE2 plays an important role in negatively regulating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone

197

system (RAS) to counterbalance ACE 52. Downregulation of ACE2 and elevated plasma

198

angiotensin II level have been observed after SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 or influenza infection,

199

contributing to hyper-activated RAS cascades and ARDS 18-20,22,52. Supplementing soluble ACE2

200

can balance RAS and improve ARDS conditions 17,21-23,52,53. These factors all seem to support the

201

beneficial effects of the biological function of ACE2 for treating COVID-19 patients even

202

though further studies are still needed to confer this advantage. Thus, proteins engineered based

203

on wild-type ACE2, such as T-ACE2, can potently and broadly inhibit virus infections, they also

204

have the added benefits of regulating RAS and alleviating ARDS. These potential beneficial

205

effects distinguish proteins like T-ACE2 from neutralizing antibodies. We believe T-ACE2

206

represents a promising class of proteins to broadly inhibit SARS-CoVs and to treat viruses

207

infected patients. Finally, the extremely high binding affinity between T-ACE2 and spike protein

208

(KD < 1pM) suggests that T-ACE2 could also be useful for virus detection. The fact that T-ACE2

209

was engineered based on native ACE2 sequence also makes such detection methods widely

210

useful for all SARS-CoVs and related viruses.

Methods

289

Protein preparations

290

To construct trimeric ACE2s, we inserted the linker sequences (GGGGS)5, (EAAAK)5 or

291

GGGS after ACE2(1-615), followed by trimerization motifs, an HRV3C cleavage sequence, an

292

eGFP tag and a His8 tag. Monomeric ACE2 was constructed as ACE2(1-615)-(GGGGS)5-

293

HRV3C-eGFP- His8 for direct comparison.

294

The ACE2 (accession number: NM_001371415) peptidase domain (1-615) was cloned from

295

the plasmid donated by Peihui Wang’s lab. The genes of 3HB and foldon were synthesized by

296

Genewiz, Suzhou, China. All the gene fragments were assembled by the Gibson assembly kit

297

(Cat.C112-01, Vazyme). The assembled fragments were subcloned in pEGFP-N1 for expression.

298

The cloned plasmids were transformed into E.coli DH5α for amplification. Amplified plasmids

299

were extracted using the GoldHi EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit (Cat. CW2104M, CWBio).

300

HEK 293F cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in Freestyle medium (Gibco, Lot.2164683) at

301

37 °C under 6% CO2 in a CRYSTAL shaker (140 rpm). The cells were transiently transfected

302

with ACE2 plasmids and polyethylenimine (PEI) (Polysciences, Cat.24765-1) when the cell

303

density reached approximately 1.0×106/mL. 1 mg of plasmid was premixed with 2.6 mg PEI in

304

50 mL of fresh medium for 15 minutes before adding to one liter of cell culture. The transfected

305

cells were cultured for 96 hours before harvesting.

306

For purification of ACE2 proteins, the cell supernatants were harvested by centrifugation at

307

1000×g for 5 minutes. Then the supernatants were loaded on Ni-NTA beads (Smart-Lifesciences,

308

Cat. SA004100) and washed with washing buffer (5 mM imidazole, 1 × PBS). Proteins were

309

then eluted with elution buffer (50 mM imidazole, 1 × PBS).

310

The eluted proteins were concentrated and subjected to size-exclusion chromatography

311

(Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare) in the PBS buffer. The peak fractions were

312

collected and concentrated. The proteins were then analyzed by size exclusion chromatography

313

(AdvanceBio SEC 300Å) in PBS buffer pH 7.4. The standard proteins were purchased from GE

314

(fig S2).

315

To remove C-terminal tags of ACE2 proteins, 16 µg HRV3C protease (expressed and

316

purified in house) was add to 1mg ACE2 protein and incubated at 4 °C overnight, followed by

317

size-exclusion chromatography (Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare) purification

318

and analysis.

Binding affinity measurement using ELISA assays

320

Determination of optimal S-ECD loading

321

96-well ELISA plates (JET BIOFIL, #FEP-100-096) were coated with 50 μL per well of

322

different S-ECD protein concentrations (fig S3) in coating buffer (NCM Biotech, #E30500)

323

overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20

324

(PBST) four times and then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma, #B2064-50G)

325

in PBST for 2 hours at room temperature. After blocking, the plates were washed with PBST

326

four times and then incubated with 70 μL per well of ACE2 monomer in PBST for 2 hours at

327

37°C. Plates were washed with PBST four times then incubated with 70 μL per well of 1:2,000

328

dilution of Anti-GFP antibody (Rabbit PAb, Sino Biological, #13105-RP01) for 1 h at 37 °C.

329

Plates were again washed four times, followed by incubation with 70 μL per well of 1:10,000

330

dilution of HRP-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (Beyotime, #A0208) for 1 hour at 37 °C.

331

After final washing, 100 μL per well of TMB single-component substrate solution were added to

332

the plates (Solarbio, #PR1200), and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μL per well of

333

1M hydrochloric acid. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured on a Microplate reader (Thermo,

334

Varioskan LUX). From this experiment, we decided to load 3 μg/mL S-ECD for ACE2 protein

335

binding measurement.

Binding measurements
To determine the binding affinities of different ACE2 proteins, 96-well ELISA plates (JET

339

BIOFIL, #FEP-100-096) were coated with 50 μL per well of S-ECD (3 μg/mL ) in coating buffer

340

(NCM Biotech, #E30500) overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline

341

with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) four times and then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA,

342

Sigma, #B2064-50G) in PBST for 2 hours at room temperature. After blocking, the plates were

343

washed with PBST four times and then incubated with 70 μL per well of series diluted ACE2

344

samples in PBST for 2 hours at 37°C. Plates were washed with PBST four times and then

345

incubated with 70 μL per well of 1:2,000 dilution of Anti-GFP antibody (Rabbit PAb, Sino

346

Biological, #13105-RP01) for 1 hour at 37 °C. Plates were again washed four times, followed by

347

Protein biotinylation

355

Purified S-ECD protein was biotinylated at a theoretical 1:3 molar ratio with EZ-Link NHS-

356

PEG12-Biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, CAT#: 21313) according to the manufacturer’s

357

instructions. The unreacted biotin was removed by ultrafiltration with an Amicon column (30

358

KDa MWCO, Millipore, CAT: UFC5010BK).

359
360
361

Kinetics analyses
For kinetics analyses, S-ECD was captured on streptavidin biosensors. Biotinylated S-ECD

362

was diluted to 20 µg/mL in dilution buffer (PBS with 0.02% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA). Then

363

sensor baselines were equilibrated in the dilution buffer for 90 seconds. Next, the S-ECD was

364

loaded until the thickness signal was 0.6 nm or 0.3 nm (low loading). After loading, the sensors

365

were washed for 60 seconds in the dilution buffer. The sensors were then immersed into wells

366

containing ACE2 proteins for 100 seconds (association phase), followed by immersion in

367

dilution buffers for an additional 300 seconds (dissociation phase). The background signal was

368

measured using a reference sensor with S-ECD loading but no ACE2 protein binding and was

369

subtracted from the corresponding ACE2 binding sensor. Curve fitting was performed using a

370

1:1 binding model and the ForteBio data analysis software. Mean kon, koff, KD values were

371

determined by averaging all binding curves that matched the theoretical fit with an R2 value of

372

0.95.

Cell lines, plasmids construction and virus
Human hepatoma Huh-7 cells were purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy

376

of Science (Shanghai, China). Human primary embryonic kidney cells (293T) (CRL-3216™)

377

and African green monkey kidney Vero-E6 (CRL-1586™) were obtained from the American

378

Type Culture Collection (ATCC). These cells were cultured with Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s

379

Medium (DMEM) containing 10% Fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 100

380

U/mL penicillin at 37 °C under 5% CO2.

SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 / SH01 / human / 2020 / CHN，GenBank No. MT121215)

387

was isolated from a COVID-19 patient in Shanghai, China. The virus was purified and

388

propagated in Vero-E6 cells, then stocked at -80 ℃. Viral titer was measured by the 50% Tissue

389

culture infective dose (TCID50) method. All experiments involving live SARS-CoV-2 virus

390

were performed in Biosafety Level 3 Laboratory (BSL-3), Fudan University.

412

The live SARS-CoV-2 inhibition assay was performed as previously described 56. Briefly,

413

Vero-E6 cells were seeded into the 96-well cell culture plate at 3×104 per well and cultured for

414

12 hours. Recombinant proteins were diluted with FBS-free DMEM, mixed with 100 TCID50 of

415

SARS-CoV-2, and incubated at 37 ℃ for 1 hour. Then, the protein-virus mixtures were added to

416

Vero-E6 cells and incubated at 37 ℃ for 1 hour. After removing the mixtures, cells were

417

cultured with fresh DMEM containing 2% FBS for another 48 hours. Then, the supernatants

418

were collected to detect viral RNA titer. The cells were fixed to perform immunofluorescence

419

analysis. After fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde, the cells were permeabilized by 0.2% Triton

420

X-100 and blocked with 3% BSA for 1 hour. Then the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Antibody

421

(1:500) (Sino Biological) was added to cells and reacted at 4℃ overnight. Finally, the cells were

422

incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (1:500) (Invitrogen, USA) at 37℃ for 1

443

a molar ratio of about 1:2 for one hour at 4 °C. The mixture was subjected to size-exclusion

444

chromatography (Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL, GE Healthcare) in buffer containing 25 mM

445

Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl. Peak fractions of S-ECD in complex with T-ACE2 were collected

446

for EM analysis.

447

The peak fractions of the complex were concentrated to about 1.5 mg/mL and mixed with

448

0.05% Octyl Maltoside, Fluorinated (Anatrace) before application to the grids. Aliquots (3.3 μL)

449

of the protein complex were placed on glow-discharged holey carbon grids (Quantifoil Au

450

R1.2/1.3). The grids were blotted for 2.5 s or 3.0 s and flash-frozen in liquid ethane cooled by

451

liquid nitrogen with Vitrobot (Mark IV, Thermo Scientific). The cryo-EM samples were

452

transferred to a Titan Krios operating at 300 kV equipped with Cs corrector, Gatan K3 Summit

453

detector and GIF Quantum energy filter. Movie stacks were automatically collected using

454

AutoEMation 58 with a slit width of 20 eV on the energy filter and a defocus range from -1.2 µm

455

to -2.2 µm in super-resolution mode at a nominal magnification of 81,000×. Each stack was

456

exposed for 2.56 s with an exposure time of 0.08 s per frame, resulting in a total of 32 frames per

457

stack. The total dose rate was approximately 50 e-/Å2 for each stack. The stacks were motion

458

corrected with MotionCor2 59 and binned 2-fold, resulting in a pixel size of 1.087 Å/pixel.

459

Meanwhile, dose weighting was performed 60. The defocus values were estimated with Gctf 61.

460
461
462

Data processing
Particles were automatically picked using Relion 3.0.6 62-65 from manually selected

463

micrographs. After 2D classification with Relion, good particles were selected and subjected to

464

two cycles of heterogeneous refinement without symmetry using cryoSPARC 66.The good

465

particles were selected and subjected to Non-uniform Refinement (beta) with C1 symmetry,

466

resulting in the 3D reconstruction for the whole structures that were further subjected to 3D

467

classification, 3D auto-refinement and post-processing with Relion. For interface between RBD

468

and ACE2, the datasets were subjected to focused refinement with adapted mask on each RBD

469

and ACE2 subcomplex to improve the map quality. Then the dataset of three RBD and ACE2

470

sub-complexes were combined and subjected to focused refinement with Relion, resulting in the

471

3D reconstruction of better quality on the interface between S-ECD and ACE2.

Model building and structure refinement
For model building of the complex of S-ECD with ACE2, the atomic model of the published

478

structure S-ECD (PDB ID: 7C2L) and ACE2 molecular (PDB ID: 6M18) were used as

479

templates, which were molecular dynamics flexible fitted (MDFF) 69 into the whole cryo-EM

480

map of the complex and the focused-refined cryo-EM map of the RBD-ACE2 subcomplex,

481

respectively. The fitted atomic models were further manually adjusted with Coot 70. Each residue

482

was manually checked with the chemical properties taken into consideration during model

483

building. Several segments, the corresponding densities of which were invisible, were not

484

modeled. Structural refinement was performed in Phenix 71 with secondary structure and

485

geometry restraints to prevent overfitting. To monitor the potential overfitting, the model was

486
