ABSTRACT
SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated by binding of the viral spike protein to its receptor,
ACE2, on the surface of host cells. ACE2 expression is heterogeneous both in vivo and in
immortalized cell lines, but the molecular pathways that govern ACE2 expression remain
unclear. We now report high-throughput CRISPR screens for functional modifiers of ACE2
surface abundance. We identified 35 genes whose disruption was associated with a change in
the surface abundance of ACE2 in HuH7 cells. Enriched among these ACE2 regulators were
established transcription factors, epigenetic regulators, and functional networks. We further
characterized individual cell lines with disruption of SMAD4, EP300, PIAS1, or BAMBI and
found these genes to regulate ACE2 at the mRNA level and to influence cellular susceptibility to
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our findings clarify the host factors involved in SARS-CoV-2
entry and suggest potential targets for therapeutic development.

INTRODUCTION
ACE2 plays a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 infection by serving as the cellular receptor for
viral entry (Zamorano Cuervo and Grandvaux, 2020). Inhibition of endogenous ACE2 disrupts
SARS-CoV-2 entry into permissive cell lines while heterologous expression of ACE2 in nonpermissive cell lines renders them susceptible to infection (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Ou et al.,
2020; Walls et al., 2020). Transgenic expression of human ACE2 sensitizes mice to SARS-CoV2 infection with recapitulation of pathologic hallmarks of COVID-19 (Bao et al., 2020; Jiang et
al., 2020; Winkler et al., 2020).
Given its critical role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, the interaction between the viral spike
protein and ACE2 is an attractive target for therapeutic development. Vaccines against the spike
protein are broadly efficacious in reducing the number and severity of COVID-19 infections
(Klasse et al., 2021), but the rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 raises concern for the potential of
SARS-CoV-2 variants to escape immunity induced by either vaccines or prior infection (Cele et
al., 2021; Garcia-Beltran et al., 2021; McCarthy et al., 2021). As an alternative strategy,
disruption of host ACE2 may similarly prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in a manner that is less
susceptible to viral evolution. ACE2-targeted therapies may have broader clinical applications,
as ACE2 also serves as the cellular receptor for other respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-1
(Li et al., 2003) and HCoV-NL63 (Hofmann et al., 2005). Additionally, ACE2 is an important
physiologic regulator of the renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-kinin systems, and its dysregulation
has been implicated in pulmonary and systemic hypertension, cardiac fibrosis, atherosclerosis,
and acute respiratory distress syndrome (Gheblawi et al., 2020). However, no ACE2-targeted
therapies have been clinically approved and their development is limited by uncertainty in the
molecular pathways that regulate ACE2.

Since the onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic, several studies have applied singlecell RNA-seq to examine ACE2 expression in tissues of humans and animal models (Menon et
al., 2020; Sungnak et al., 2020; Ziegler et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2020). These studies have
consistently found ACE2 mRNA expression to be heterogeneous among cell types within a
given tissue. ACE2-expressing cells include alveolar type 2 cells in the lung, goblet cells in the
nasopharynx, absorptive enterocytes in the gut, and proximal tubular epithelial cells in the
kidney. Even within a given cellular subtype, ACE2 expression is heterogeneous, with only ~15% of lung AT2 cells, for example, containing detectable ACE2 mRNA. Prior investigations have
identified two distinct promoters for full-length ACE2 which vary across tissues in their relative
usage (Pedersen et al., 2013), as well as a cryptic promoter driving expression of an interferonresponsive truncated ACE2 isoform (Ng et al., 2020; Onabajo et al., 2020). Other studies have
identified putative transcription factor binding sites and epigenome signatures associated with
the ACE2 locus (Beacon et al., 2020; Chlamydas et al., 2020) as well as transcriptome profiles
associated with ACE2 expression (Barker and Parkkila, 2020; Feng et al., 2020).
Importantly, single cell RNA-seq approaches have intrinsic limitations for low abundance
transcripts (Saliba et al., 2014), and most studies of ACE2 mRNA have lacked validation at the
protein level. Investigations of ACE2 protein expression have been relatively limited and
confounded by uncertain specificity of different commercial ACE2 antibodies. Recently, we
engineered ACE2-overexpressing and ACE2-deleted cell lines and performed systematic
testing of a panel of commercial antibodies by flow cytometry, finding only 2 of 13 to exhibit
specificity and sensitivity for ACE2 surface protein (Sherman and Emmer, 2021). Unexpectedly,
we found that multiple isogenic cell lines demonstrated heterogeneity of endogenous ACE2
expression, suggesting that they may serve as a simplified model to dissect the molecular
pathways that govern ACE2 expression. To this end, we now report the findings of our highthroughput CRISPR screens for modifiers of endogenous ACE2 surface abundance in HuH7

cells. We identified 35 previously unrecognized ACE2 regulators, which we then analyzed for
molecular functions, genetic interactions, and influence on viral infection. Arrayed single gene
validation studies confirmed the ACE2 regulatory effect for 18 of 20 genes tested, enabled a
more detailed characterization of a subset of selected genes, and demonstrated the relevance
of these ACE2 modifiers to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

RESULTS
CRISPR screen for ACE2 modifiers.
To identify functional regulators of ACE2 surface abundance, we first defined a list of
candidate genes from several different sources (Figure 1A, Supplemental Table 1). These
included modifiers of SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect in recently reported CRISPR screens
(Daniloski et al., 2021; Gordon et al., 2020; Heaton et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2021; Wei et
al., 2021), genes in proximity to human GWAS loci associated with COVID-19 susceptibility
(Ganna, 2021) (Supplemental Table 2), genes we previously identified by RNA-seq whose
correlation was associated with ACE2 expression in sorted HuH7 cells (Sherman and Emmer,
2021), candidates identified in our own pilot genome-wide CRISPR screens for ACE2
abundance (Figure S1, Supplemental Tables 3-4), and a set of hypothesis-driven manually
selected genes. In total, we targeted 833 genes with 15 gRNA per gene. Amplicons of the
pooled gRNA sequences were inserted into the pLentiCRISPRv2 construct (Sanjana et al.,
2014) and the diversity and representation of the resulting plasmid pool were verified by deep
sequencing.
We independently screened both HuH7 wild-type cells, in which ~3-5% of cells express
detectable ACE2, and HuH7 cells derived by serial enrichment with 3 rounds of FACS to contain
~60-70% ACE2-positive cells (Figures 1B, C). Cells were then transduced at >200X coverage

with the customized CRISPR library, passaged for 14 days to allow for target gene mutagenesis
and turnover of residual protein, and sorted by flow cytometry into selected populations. In the
screen of wild-type cells, the ~3-5% of ACE2-positive cells were collected in one population and
the median ~10% of ACE2-negative cells were collected in another. In the screen of ACE2enriched cells, the top ~10% of cells with the greatest ACE2 abundance were collected along
with the median ~10% of ACE2-negative cells. The relative abundance of every gRNA in each
population was quantified by deep sequencing. In accordance with the depth of library coverage
in this screen, we found >99.9% library representation in each sorted cell population with
minimal skewing of gRNA representation (Figure S3A, B). As expected, ACE2 itself was
identified among the top positive regulators of ACE2 abundance in both screens (Figure S3C,
D), while gRNAs targeting many other genes without a known role in ACE2 regulation exhibited
significant enrichment or depletion in sorted populations (Figure 1D, E, Supplemental Tables 5,
6). In total, we identified 19 high-confidence positive regulators and 16 high-confidence negative
regulators of ACE2 surface abundance in HuH7 cells (FDR<0.05, absolute value of log2 foldchange >1). Supporting the reproducibility of the screen results, there was a very high degree of
concordance between the results of the independent screens of wild-type and ACE2-enriched
cells (Figure 1F, r = 0.84).

Arrayed validation of ACE2 modifiers.
To validate our CRISPR screen results, we generated single gene CRISPR-targeting
lentivirus constructs for 21 of the top-scoring hits from either screen and tested whether single
gene disruption affected surface ACE2 levels. We found one gene, UROD, to be a false positive
of the screen due to its disruption causing increased cellular autofluorescence in the detection
channel of the Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated secondary antibody. UROD-targeted cells exhibited
increased fluorescence in this channel even when the conjugated secondary antibody was

omitted (Figure S5A), and replacement of this secondary antibody with an Alexa Fluor 488conjugated secondary antibody abrogated the difference in ACE2 signal (Figure S5B). These
findings are consistent with the known role of UROD in decarboxylating uroporphyrinogen-III, as
cells with accumulation of uroporphyrin have been shown to exhibit increased fluorescence
between 620-680 nm (Schneckenburger et al., 1989). Of the remaining genes, we confirmed a
significant effect of single gene CRISPR-targeting on ACE2 surface staining for 18 of 20 genes
in either HuH7 wild-type or ACE2-enriched cells (Figures 2, S6, S7; Supplemental Table 7), with
none of these genes showing increased autofluorescence and each replicating the change in
ACE2 abundance with an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody. Consistent with the
stronger enrichment and depletion of hits in the CRISPR screen of ACE2-enriched cells relative
to wild-type cells, validation testing of these ACE2-enriched cells also exhibited increased power
to detect significant changes in ACE2 surface abundance (Supplemental Table 7).

ACE2 modifiers are enriched for regulators of gene expression, functional networks, and
viral host factors.
We next analyzed the 35 ACE2 modifiers identified in our CRISPR screens for
enrichment in annotated gene ontologies and protein-protein interactions. We found the greatest
enrichment for several molecular functions involved in gene expression, including transcriptional
regulation, chromatin binding, and DNA binding (Figure 3A). ACE2 modifiers were significantly
enriched (p <10-12) for annotated protein-protein interactions in the STRING database (Figure
3B) (Szklarczyk et al., 2019).
We cross-referenced the data from our ACE2 CRISPR screen in HuH7 cells to that from
a recently reported genome-wide CRISPR screen of HuH7.5 cellular sensitivity to infection by
SARS-CoV-2 or by other coronaviruses (Schneider et al., 2021). As expected, ACE2 itself was
among the top genes identified both as a positive regulator of ACE2 surface abundance in

HuH7 cells in our screen and as a proviral host factor for both SARS-CoV-2 and another ACE2dependent coronavirus, HCoV-NL63, but not for other coronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoVOC43, that use alternative cellular receptors (Figure 3C) (Hulswit et al., 2019; Yeager et al.,
1992). Overall, among the genes we identified as ACE2 regulators, those that promoted ACE2
abundance in our screen were more likely to sensitize HuH7.5 cells to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoVNL63 infection, while those that repressed ACE2 abundance were more likely to confer
resistance to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 infection (Figure 3C, D). A similar correlation for
ACE2 modifiers with cytopathic effect was not observed for HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43
(Figure 3D). These findings support the relevance of our ACE2 screen to viral infection and
suggest that even modest changes in ACE2 expression may influence cellular susceptibility to
viral cytopathic effect.

Cholesterol regulatory genes that influence coronavirus infection do not influence ACE2
surface abundance.
Multiple CRISPR screens have implicated cholesterol regulation as an important
mediator of host cell interactions with SARS-CoV-2 (Daniloski et al., 2021; Hoffmann et al.,
2021; Schneider et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021). In addition to canonical SREBP regulators, we
also noted the identification of several genes in these studies that we had recently identified in a
screen for regulators of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake (Emmer et al., 2021). These
included RAB10 and multiple components of the exocyst complex (Hoffmann et al., 2021;
Schneider et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021). We therefore systematically examined the overlap
among these CRISPR screens for LDL uptake, viral infection, and ACE2 abundance. We
observed that gene disruptions which reduced LDL uptake were also more likely to confer
cellular resistance to SARS-CoV-2 both at 37⁰C and at 33⁰C (Figure S3A). By contrast,
disruption of these same genes was not associated with a significant change in ACE2

abundance in either of our screens of wild-type or ACE2-enriched HuH7 cells (Figure S3B).
Further supporting an ACE2-independent effect on viral infection, positive regulators of LDL
uptake did not influence cellular sensitivity to HCoV-NL63 (Figure S3A). Among these,
disruption of the canonical SREBP regulators SCAP, MBTPS1, and MBTPS2 conferred
resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a similar effect for infection with the ACE2independent HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E but not the ACE2-dependent HCoV2-NL63 (Figure
S3C). These findings suggest that cholesterol regulatory host factors likely influence SARSCoV-2 infection through an ACE2-independent mechanism.

Regulation of ACE2 by SMAD4, EP300, PIAS1, and BAMBI is mediated at the mRNA level.
Among the genes with the largest functional influence on ACE2 abundance in our screen
and in our single gene validation experiments were SMAD4 and multiple genes previously
associated with SMAD4 signaling. These include EP300, encoding a histone acetyltransferase
that is recruited by SMAD complexes to function as a coactivator for target genes (Feng et al.,
1998; Janknecht et al., 1998); PIAS1, encoding an E3 sumo ligase whose substrates include
SMAD4 and which has been shown to modulate SMAD4-dependent TGF-β signaling (Liang et
al., 2004); and BAMBI, encoding a decoy receptor that negatively regulates TGF-β signaling
through SMAD4 (Onichtchouk et al., 1999). To establish the level of regulation for ACE2 surface
protein by these modifiers, we analyzed HuH7 cells individually targeted for each gene by
CRISPR. To distinguish between changes in cell surface ACE2 being due either to a change in
total cellular levels or to altered trafficking of ACE2, we quantified total cellular ACE2 protein
abundance both by immunoblotting of cell lysates (Figure 4A) and by flow cytometry of
permeabilized cells (Figure 4B). In all cases, changes in total cellular ACE2 abundance were
consistent with changes in surface ACE2 abundance. Immunofluorescence microscopy of
permeabilized cells likewise demonstrated alterations in total ACE2 abundance with no striking

redistribution of ACE2 in CRISPR-targeted cells (Figure 4C). Quantitative RT-PCR
demonstrated changes in ACE2 mRNA levels in CRISPR-targeted cells that were consistent
with the changes in surface-displayed ACE2 protein in these cells (Figure 4D). Together, these
findings indicate that ACE2 regulation by SMAD4, EP300, PIAS1, and BAMBI in HuH7 cells is
mediated at the mRNA level.

ACE2 modifiers alter cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
We next analyzed HuH7 cells with CRISPR-mediated disruption of ACE2 modifiers for
their sensitivity to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that those CRISPR-targeted cells with
decreased ACE2 expression (SMAD4, EP300, and PIAS1) also exhibited a decrease in both the
proportion of infected cells by SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein immunofluorescence (Figure
5A) and in viral infectivity by TCID50 (Figure 5B) at 48 hours post-infection. By contrast, cells
with increased ACE2 expression (BAMBI) exhibited an increase in the proportion of SARS-CoV2-infected cells and viral infectious titers. These findings, together with the correlation of results
from our ACE2 screen and the HuH7.5 SARS-CoV-2 screen (Schneider et al., 2021), support
the relevance of our identified ACE2 modifiers to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

DISCUSSION
CRISPR screening is a powerful forward genetic tool for the unbiased and highthroughput functional interrogation of the human genome. This approach has been successful in
the identification of host factors involved in the molecular pathogenesis for many viruses
(Puschnik et al., 2017), including SARS-CoV-2 (Baggen et al., 2021; Daniloski et al., 2021;
Gordon et al., 2020; Heaton et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2021; Schneider et al., 2021; Wang et
al., 2021; Wei et al., 2021). For most identified host factors, however, the molecular basis for

interaction with SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. Consistently, these screens have lent further
support to the central importance of ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 infection, with guide RNAs targeting
ACE2 among those conferring the greatest resistance to cytopathic effect. Our current study,
enabled by our recently reported identification of a sensitive and specific platform for ACE2 flow
cytometry (Sherman and Emmer, 2021), complements the former studies to systematically
probe the genetic regulators of ACE2 surface abundance in HuH7 cells.
An important caveat of our study is the focused nature of our library, limited to highresolution functional testing of 833 candidate genes. Our initial attempts at genome-wide
screening did nominate candidate ACE2 regulators that were included in our focused library, but
these pilot studies were limited by an experimental bottleneck at the cell sorting stage with
inadequate depth of coverage to support definitive conclusions about each gene tested.
Nevertheless, for those genes interrogated by the focused library, several observations support
a high degree of confidence in the functional significance of each gene to ACE2 surface
abundance. First, the internal control ACE2-targeting gRNAs were clearly depleted in ACE2positive cells. Second, the genes that were identified as regulating ACE2 abundance exhibited a
robust statistical enrichment or depletion. Third, we observed a very high degree of
concordance in the degree of enrichment or depletion observed for each gene between the
independent screens of wild-type or ACE2-enriched HuH7 cells. Fourth, identified genes were
highly enriched for related functional annotations and protein-protein interactions and exhibited
significant overlap with previously identified modulators of HuH7.5 cellular susceptibility to
ACE2-dependent coronaviruses. Finally, of the screen hits we selected for single gene
validation testing, the vast majority (18 of 21) were confirmed to regulate ACE2 surface
abundance.
Given the sensitivity of our screens to detect subtle influences on ACE2 abundance, a
number of negative findings are noteworthy. Cholesterol regulatory genes in the SREBP

pathway have been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection, but we did not detect an association
with ACE2 abundance either by focused analysis of canonical SREBP regulators or by
systematic comparison to all HuH7 LDL uptake regulators identified in our previously reported
genome-wide CRISPR screen (Emmer et al., 2021). These findings are consistent with the
association of SREBP regulators with ACE2-independent coronaviruses and the lack of
association with ACE2-dependent HCoV-NL63. Angiotensin receptor blockade has been
postulated to increase surface ACE2 expression, raising concern for potential increased
COVID-19 risk for patients on ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. We did not
however detect any association of AGTR1 or AGTR2 with ACE2 abundance. We also did not
observe an effect for disruption of the Ang[1-7] receptor MAS1, arguing against feedback
regulation of this axis in these cells. Although estrogen regulation of ACE2 expression has been
proposed to mediate the sexual dimorphism of COVID-19 susceptibility, and estrogen receptor
binding sites have been identified near the ACE2 locus (Barker and Parkkila, 2020), we did not
detect an effect of ESR1 or ESR2 disruption on ACE2 abundance. We also did not detect a
large effect for any candidate genes in proximity to variants associated with COVID-19
susceptibility by GWAS. Each of these negative results should be interpreted with caution,
however, both because of the potential cell type specificity of ACE2 regulation and the intrinsic
limitation of CRISPR screens for functionally redundant genes, essential genes, or
compensatory mechanisms in mutant cells.
SMAD4, which we identified as a positive regulator of ACE2 gene expression, is a
common mediator of TGF-β signaling (Zhao et al., 2018). In the canonical TGF-β signaling
pathway, ligand binding signals through receptor-regulated SMADs that complex with SMAD4 to
trigger its translocation into the nucleus and binding to specific DNA regulatory elements.
Identification of the upstream signals driving SMAD4-dependent ACE2 expression in HuH7 cells
is complicated by the diversity of over 40 TGF-beta superfamily receptors and a variety of

ligands including bone morphogenic proteins, nodal, and activin. Our screen did identify
ACVR1, encoding activin A receptor type 1, as a positive regulator of ACE2, and this gene was
similarly identified as proviral for SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 in HuH7.5 cells (Schneider et
al., 2021). The limited scope of our screen, however, precludes a comprehensive cataloguing of
other potential upstream mediators of SMAD4-dependent ACE2 expression. Consistent with our
results, a recent study identified ChIP-seq peaks for SMAD4 in intestinal epithelial cells that
overlapped putative enhancer regions near the murine Ace2 locus, and furthermore detected
reduced Ace2 intestinal transcript levels upon tissue-specific Smad4 deletion (Chen et al.,
2021).
Our findings are consistent with a growing body of evidence supporting the cell type
specificity of genetic interactions relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although we observed
significant overlap in the ACE2 modifiers identified in our screens with recently identified SARSCoV-2 infection modifiers in HuH7.5 cells (Schneider et al., 2021), minimal overlap was
observed with a similar screen of Vero E6 cells (Wei et al., 2021). In the latter study, single gene
disruption of SMAD4 in Calu-3 cells similarly was not associated with SARS-CoV-2 resistance.
As expected, we observed little overlap in our identified ACE2 modifiers with other genome-wide
SARS-CoV-2 screens that used cell lines engineered with ectopic expression of ACE2 (Baggen
et al., 2021; Daniloski et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021). For those SARS-CoV-2 screens using
cells with endogenous ACE2 expression, it is possible that this discordance may be attributable
to technical differences between the screens. However, a cell type-specific network regulating
SARS-CoV-2 entry is also supported by small molecule inhibitor studies (Dittmar et al., 2021)
and by the tissue-specific patterns of ACE2 promoter usage (Pedersen et al., 2013).
In summary, we have applied a functional genomic approach to dissect the regulatory
networks of ACE2 protein expression in HuH7 cells. We have identified many previously
unrecognized genetic modifiers of ACE2 expression and a putative mechanism for genes

previously implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. For SMAD4, EP300, PIAS1, and BAMBI, we
established their level of regulation on ACE2 and their influence on SARS-CoV-2 infection.
These findings clarify the molecular determinants of ACE2 expression and nominate pathways
for host-targeted therapeutic development.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Genome-wide ACE2 CRISPR screen.
Wild-type or serially ACE2-enriched HuH7 cells were independently screened. For each of 4
biologic replicates for each cell line, a total of ~100 million cells were transduced with the
GeCKOv2 library (Sanjana et al., 2014) at an MOI of ~0.3. Puromycin was added at a
concentration of 3 µg/mL at day 1 post-transduction and maintained until selection of control
uninfected cells was complete. Cells were passaged as needed to maintain logarithmic phase
growth with total cell number maintained above a minimum of 25 million cells at all stages of the
screen. At 14 days post-transduction, a total of ~200 million cells were harvested and stained
for surface ACE2 abundance as previously described with ACE2 antibody (R&D Systems
#MAB9332) at 1:50 dilution in FACS buffer (PBS supplemented with 2% FBS) and Alexa Fluor
647-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (AlexaFluor647 goat anti-rabbit IgG
(Fisher #A32733) at 1:500 dilution in FACS buffer. Flow cytometry gates were defined for cell
viability by exclusion of SYTOX Blue Dead Cell Stain (Fisher, S34857) and for ACE2 expression
by comparison to unstained or ACE2-targeted control cells. For the screen of wild-type HuH7
cells, the ~3-5% of the total cells that were positive for ACE2 staining (as defined by gating of
unstained cells) were collected. For the screen of ACE2-enriched HuH7 cells, the brightest 10%
ACE2-positive cells were collected. For both screens, a gate of the median 10% of ACE2negative cells were also collected. Genomic DNA was extracted and gRNA sequences amplified
and sequenced as previously described (Emmer et al., 2021).

to reference gRNA sequences with deconvolution by barcode. Cumulative distribution functions
of gRNA representation were generated by plotting normalized read counts of each gRNA
against its relative rank for a given barcode. Individual gRNA-level and aggregate gene-level
enrichment analysis was performed using MAGeCK(Li et al., 2014). Q-Q plots were generated
by plotting log-transformed observed p-values (calculated by MAGeCK gene-level analysis)
against expected p-values (determined by the relative rank of each gene among the library).
Genes were considered screen hits if they were identified with a MAGeCK-calculated false
discovery rate < 0.05 and absolute log2 fold-change > 1 in either analysis of HuH7 wild-type or
ACE2-enriched cells. Enrichment of molecular functions among secondary screen hits relative
to all genes in the secondary library was performed using GOrilla(Eden et al., 2009). Gene
network analysis of secondary screen hits was performed using the STRING database
(Szklarczyk et al., 2019) with default settings and visualized with Cytoscape (Shannon et al.,
2003). Heatmaps were generated with log-transformed p-values from our study and from
Schneider et al.(Schneider et al., 2021) using GraphPad Prism v9.1.0.
Design and synthesis of secondary CRISPR library.
Candidate genes were selected from (i) top candidate genes identified in our primary genomewide CRISPR screen for ACE2 surface abundance; (ii) genes identified in CRISPR screens as
candidate modifiers of SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect (Daniloski et al., 2021; Gordon et al.,
2020; Heaton et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021; Wei et al., 2021); (iii) genes
whose expression was correlated with ACE2 surface abundance in HuH7 cells (Sherman and
Emmer, 2021); (iv) genes in proximity to loci associated with COVID-19 susceptibility by GWAS
(described below); (v) candidate genes identified in our own pilot CRISPR screens of ACE2
surface abundance in ACE2-overexpressing HEK293T cells or Caco2 cells or SARS-CoV-2
cytopathic effect in Caco2 cells; and (vi) hypothesis-driven manually selected genes. For each
gene, a total of 15 optimized gRNA sequences were identified using the Broad Genetic

Perturbation Platform (Sanson et al., 2018). For identification of COVID-19 GWAS loci, data
freeze 4 of the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative was used (Ganna, 2021). Lead SNPs were
selected from the analysis of hospitalized COVID-19 patients relative to population controls. For
each indicated SNP, genes were selected based on their physical proximity to the SNP and by
their Polygenic Priority Score (Weeks et al., 2020) (Supplemental Table 2). Flanking sequences
were appended to facilitate PCR amplification and oligonucleotides were synthesized by
CustomArray (Bothell, WA). DNA assembly of the secondary library plasmid pool was
performed with 125 ng of PCR amplicon and 825 ng of BsmBI-digested pLentiCRISPRv2 in a
total reaction volume of 100 μL with HiFI DNA Assembly Mix (NEB) for 30 min at 50°C.
Assembly products were purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) and 5 electroporations were performed into Endura electrocompetent cells (Lucigen,
Middleton WI) and plated onto 24.5 cm2 LB-agar plates. After 14 hr at 37°C, bacteria were
harvested and plasmid DNA purified with an EndoFree Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen). Dilution
plates of electroporated cells confirmed a colony count of >100X relative to the size of the gRNA
library and representation was confirmed by sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq with gRNA
mapping and cumulative distribution function analysis as described above. Lentiviral stocks
were generated by cotransfection of the lentiviral plasmid pool with psPAX2 and pVSVG into
HEK293T cells, harvesting of supernatants, and titering of virus stocks as previously described
(Emmer et al., 2018).
Arrayed validation of ACE2 modifiers.
For each gene tested, a single gRNA was selected from the 15 in the library based on its
degree of enrichment or depletion in the secondary screens. Each individual gRNA was ligated
into BsmBI-digested pLentiCRISPRv2(Sanjana et al., 2014) and lentiviral stocks generated and
titered as previously described(Emmer et al., 2018). HuH7 wild-type and ACE2-enriched cells
were transduced in parallel with each lentiviral construct, treated with puromycin 3 µg/mL until

no surviving cells remained among control non-transduced cells, and passaged to remain
logarithmic phase growth. Surface ACE2 abundance was quantified at day 14 post-transduction
by flow cytometry as previously described (Sherman and Emmer, 2021).
Analysis of ACE2 mRNA and protein.
Immunoblotting of HuH7 RIPA lysates was performed as previously described (Sherman and
Emmer, 2021) with antibodies against ACE2 (GeneTex, Irving CA, #GTX01160, 1:1000), β-actin
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas TX, #sc-47778, 1:5000), SMAD4, EP300, PIAS1, and
BAMBI. Permeabilization prior to ACE2 flow cytometry was performed by incubating cells prior
to blocking in 0.1% saponin in FACS buffer for 10 min, with subsequent ACE2 staining
performed as described above. Immunoflourescence microscopy of ACE2 was performed on
cells seeded in 35 mm poly-D lysine-coated glass bottom dishes (MatTek, Ashland MA, P35GC1.5-14-C) as previously described (Liang et al., 2004). Quantification of ACE2 transcript levels
was performed by preparing total RNA from 2-4×106 cells for each sample using the RNeasy
Plus Micro kit (Qiagen, Hilden Germany, #74034). For qRT-pCR, cDNA was prepared using the
SuperScript III first-strand synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher, #18080051), amplified with indicated
primers using the Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher, # 4367659), and
analyzed by QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR (Thermo Fisher).
SARS-CoV-2 infection assays.
SARS-CoV-2 WA1 strain was obtained by BEI resources and was propagated in Vero E6 cells.
Lack of genetic drift of our viral stock was confirmed by deep sequencing. Viral titers were
determined by TCID50 assays in Vero E6 cells (Reed and Muench method) by microscopic
scoring. All experiments using SARS-CoV-2 were performed at the University of Michigan under
Biosafety Level 3 (BSL3) protocols in compliance with containment procedures in laboratories
approved for use by the University of Michigan Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) and
Environment, Health and Safety (EHS). For the immunofluorescence-mediated assay, 384-well

plates (Perkin Elmer, 6057300) were seeded with HuH7 cells at 3000 cells per well and allowed
to adhere overnight. Plates were then transferred to BSL3 containment and infected with SARSCoV-2 WA1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. Two days post-infection, cells were fixed with
4% PFA for 30 minutes at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100, and
blocked with antibody buffer (1.5% BSA, 1% goat serum and 0.0025% Tween 20). The plates
were then sealed, surface decontaminated, and transferred to BSL2 for staining with antibody
against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (Antibodies Online, Cat# ABIN6952432) overnight at
4 C followed by staining with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse,
Thermo Fisher, A21235) and DAPI (Thermo FIsher). Plates were imaged with Thermo Fisher
CX5 high content microscopes with a 10X/0.45NA LUCPlan FLN objective and analyzed with a
Cell Profiler pipeline. Percentage of infected cells was calculated as previously described as Nprotein positive cells versus DAPI-positive (Mirabelli et al., 2020). For the infectivity assay,
HuH7 were seeded at 3 x 105 cells per well in a 12-well plate and allowed to adhere overnight.
The next day, cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 WA1 at a MOI of 1 at 37⁰C for 1hr. Viral
inoculum was removed by serial washing (three times). Two days post-infection cells were
harvested by scraping the monolayers and lysates were centrifuged at high speed for 5 minutes
to allow the release of intracellular viral progeny in infected cells. Infectious titer of the
supernatants was determined by TCID50 assay.
