Abstract
Genomic surveillance has a key role in tracking the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but
information on how different sequencing library preparation approaches affect the data
produced are lacking. We compared three library preparation methods using both
tagmentation (Nextera XT and Nextera Flex) and ligation-based (KAPA HyperPrep)

approaches on both positive and negative samples to provide insights into any
methodological differences between the methods, and validate their use in SARS-CoV-2
amplicon sequencing. We show that all three library preparation methods allow us to recover
near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes with identical SNP calls. The Nextera Flex and KAPA
library preparation methods gave better coverage than libraries prepared with Nextera XT,
which required more reads to call the same number of genomic positions. The KAPA
ligation-based approach shows the lowest levels of human contamination, but contaminating
reads had no effect on the downstream analysis. We found some examples of library
preparation-specific differences in minority variant calling. Overall our data shows that the
choice of Illumina library preparation method has minimal effects on consensus base calling
and downstream phylogenetic analysis, and suggests that all methods would be suitable for
use if specific reagents are difficult to obtain.

Introduction
Genomic surveillance has played an instrumental role in tracking the Coronavirus Disease
2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and shed light on the origins and transmission chains in several
countries [1–4]. Genomic epidemiology and surveillance are powerful tools for monitoring
COVID-19 intervention measures [5, 6]. The use of a multiplex tilling PCR approach
developed by the ARTIC network allows the enrichment of virus nucleic acid material for
whole-genome sequencing by generating genome-wide amplicons from minuscule amounts
of genetic material [7]. This reduces contaminating human genetic material and bypasses
virus culture which requires a facility with an advanced biological safety level. The method
has successfully been used to amplify and sequence Zika virus from patient samples with
Oxford Nanopore Technologies [8], and for multiple real-time genomic surveillance studies
on SARS-CoV-2, the etiological virus of COVID-19 [1, 9]. However, limited resources and
logistical problems during the time of pandemic has been a bottleneck for many countries to
get access to necessary reagents in time, and so availability and price of reagents, and
speed of preparation methods, could become major determinants of the sequencing
methods used during this crisis. We investigated the effect of three commonly available
library preparation approaches (Nextera XT, Nextera Flex, and KAPA HyperPrep) on data
quality with multiplex PCR amplicons of SARS-CoV-2 collected in Thailand during the period
of March 2020 using the Illumina MiSeq platform. The KAPA HyperPrep method is a ligationbased method, where Illumina-compatible index adapters are directly ligated to amplicon
products [10]. The Nextera Flex and Nextera XT kits are two widely-used methods for
transposome-based library preparation, where DNA fragmentation and adapter ligation are
combined in a single step [11]. The Nextera Flex method additionally uses bead-linked
transposomes to allow for easier library normalization [12]. Our method comparison data
provides insights into methodological differences on coverage, variant calling and data
quality, and could aid decision-making on sequencing approaches in resource-limited
settings.

Methods
Source of RNA
RNA from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients was acquired from Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok
after clinical diagnostic tests were performed. All procedures have been approved by
Ramathibodi Institutional Review Board (EC approval number: MURA2020/676). Ct values
for each sample can be found in Supplementary Table 1. Ct values for each sample can be
found in Supplementary Table 1. Human RNA was used as a negative control.
Six SARS-CoV-2 positive samples and two human RNA samples (negative controls) were
used for the RT-PCR reaction. All eight samples were then used for preparing three Illuminacompatible library types - Nextera XT, Nextera Flex, and KAPA ligation-based method. All
resulting libraries were sequenced on the same run using the Illumina MiSeq platform. The
experiment layout is summarised in Figure 1.

RT-PCR using ARTIC primers
Reverse transcription and multiplex PCR reactions were based on a published protocol from
the ARTIC Network [13] using ARTIC primer scheme version 2 which produces ~400 bp
amplicons covering ~98% of SARS-CoV-2 genome. The primers were provided as two
pools, each pool containing 49 pairs. The amplicons from PCR using these primers will
overlap each other, but do not overlap within the same pool. Information on the primer
sequences can be found at the ARTIC network repository [14]. RNA samples were diluted
based on their Ct values. Those with Ct value between 12-18 were diluted 1:10; those with Ct
value from 19 upwards were used undiluted. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed
using SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, CA, USA). PCR was performed using
Platinum SuperFi DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, CA, USA). PCR products were cleaned-up
using 1:1 of SPRI beads and eluted in 30µl elution buffer (Qiagen). The resulting amplicons
were assayed on the Fragment Analyzer System (Agilent), quantified using Qubit
Fluorometer (Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit, Invitrogen, CA, USA), and diluted to appropriate
concentrations for each library protocol.

Nextera XT library preparation
Amplicons from each pool were diluted to 0.2 ng/µl and 2.5 µl from each pool (0.5 ng) were
used as input for each library preparation reaction. For each sample, pool 1 and pool 2 were
combined into one library preparation reaction, making a total amplicon input of 1 ng. The
library preparation was performed according to Illumina Nextera XT kit protocol. Briefly, the
amplicons were incubated with the transposome to perform a tagmentation reaction which
fragmented the DNA and added adapter sequences at the 5’ and 3’ ends of each amplicon.
The products were then amplified by 12 cycles of PCR using specific index adapters for
Illumina sequencing (Nextera XT Index Kit v2, Illumina) (Supplementary Figure 1A). The
resulting libraries were cleaned up using AMPure beads (bead:library at 1.8:1 ratio) and
eluted in 50 µl of kit resuspension buffer. The negative controls had detectable amounts
(>30 ng) after the RT-PCR; therefore, 1 ng was used for Nextera XT library preparation.

Nextera Flex library preparation
Amplicons from each pool were diluted to 5 ng/µl and 10 µl from each pool (50 ng) were
used as input for each library preparation reaction. For each sample, pool 1 and pool 2 were
combined into one library preparation reaction, making a total amplicon input of 100 ng. The
library preparation was performed according to Illumina Nextera Flex kit protocol. Briefly, the
amplicons were incubated with bead-linked transposome to perform a tagmentation reaction
which fragmented the DNA and added adapter sequences at the 5’ and 3’ ends of each
amplicon. Once tagmented, the fragmented amplicons were cleaned-up and amplified by 5
cycles of PCR using specific index adapters for Illumina sequencing (Nextera™ DNA CD
Indexes, Illumina) (Supplementary Figure 1B). The resulting libraries were cleaned up using
AMPure bead (bead:library at 1.8:1 ratio) and eluted in 30 µl of kit resuspension buffer. For
the negative controls, 1 ng was used for Nextera Flex library preparation.

KAPA ligation-based library preparation
Amplicons from each pool were diluted to 1 ng/µl and 25 µl from each pool (25 ng) were
used as input for each library preparation reaction. For each sample, pool 1 and pool 2 were
combined into one library preparation reaction, making a total input amplicons of 50 ng. The
library preparation used KAPA Hyper Prep kit (Roche), and the protocol was based on a
published method [7] and the kit manual using full reaction volume. Briefly, the amplicons
were end-repaired and A-overhang added. The A-overhanged products were ligated with
index adapters for Illumina sequencing (TruSeq DNA CD Indexes, Illumina). Post-ligation
products were cleaned up using AMPure beads (bead:library at 0.8:1 ratio) and eluted in 25
µl. Then, 20 µl were used for library amplification by 8 cycles of PCR using KAPA Library
Amplification Primer Mix (Supplementary Figure 1C). The resulting libraries were cleaned up
using AMPure bead (bead:library at 1:1 ratio) and eluted in 30 µl using nuclease-free water.
For the negative controls, 1 ng was used for ligation-based library preparation.

Library QC
All libraries were assayed on Fragment Analyzer System (Agilent) and quantified using Qubit
Fluorometer (Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit, Invitrogen) prior to sequencing. For Nextera XT
and Nextera Flex, the fragment sizes of amplicon insert plus sequencing adapters were 259320 and 440-470bp, respectively. For the KAPA ligation-based method, fragment sizes were
512-556bp (Supplementary Table 2).

Library pooling and sequencing
All libraries were diluted to 2 nM. Same volume of each 2 nM library was taken to produce a
equimolar pool of 24 libraries. Of the pool, 5 µl was mixed and incubated for 5 minutes at
room temperature with 5 µl 0.1 N NaOH to denature the dsDNA. PhiX was also denatured
using 0.1 N NaOH. The denatured library pool and PhiX were each diluted to 10 pM by
adding HT1 solution from the MiSeq kit. The library pool, HT1 solution, and 5 µl 20 pM PhiX
were mixed to achieve 8 pM final library concentration at a total volume of 600 µl. The pool
was sequenced on one MiSeq run using MiSeq v2 chemistry with 250bp paired-end
sequencing.

Sequencing data QC
To identify human contamination, reads were mapped to both the human GrCH38.p11 and
the SARS-CoV-2 genome MN908947.3 using Bowtie2 [15]. All reads which mapped to the
SARS-CoV-2 genome were uploaded to the Sequence Read Archive under project
PRJEB38369.
Variant calling was performed with the ncov2019-artic-nf pipeline with default Illumina
parameters (commit f0ba0a1493c9571f4eda161ae8d6afe02d0da570) [16]. In this pipeline,
reads were mapped to the MN908947.3 reference genome using bwa 0.7.17-r1188 [17].
TrimGalore 0.6.5 [18] was used to trim reads for adaptors and low-quality regions and Ivar
v1.1_beta [19] was used to trim primer regions, call variants, identify primer mismatches
and generate consensus sequences. Reads that did not begin with a primer were retained
using the '-e' option for the two Nextera library preparation methods but not for the KAPA
libraries. Variants in primer regions were identified by Ivar getmasked. Ivar variants was run
with the parameters minimum quality score 20, minimum threshold 0.1, and minimum
coverage 50 to identify minor variants.
Reads were downsampled using seqtk 1.3-r106 [20] and run through the same pipeline to
call variants and generate consensus sequences. Coverage per amplicon was determined
using bedtools v2.29.2 [21].

Results
RT-PCR using ARTIC primers generated detectable concentration for all samples. The
negative controls yielded some product, but the amounts were lower than that of the SARSCoV-2 positive samples by at least 10-fold. No correlation of Ct values with amplicon yields
could be seen in this small sample. The PCR yield from pool 1 and pool 2 was concordant.
For library preparation, the smallest to largest insert size was Nextera XT, Nextera Flex, and
KAPA ligation-based method, respectively The highest library yield was from the KAPA
ligation-based method, followed by Nextera XT, and Nextera Flex. All three methods yielded
enough library product for use in the sequencing (Supplementary Table 2).
All 18 libraries were run together on a single MiSeq run. 812,984 to 1,662,778 sequence
reads were generated for each positive sample library. The number of reads generated and
the percentage of reads which could be mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome
were similar across library types (Figure 2A and 2B).
By mapping the reads to the human genome we could assess levels of human DNA
contamination in each sample. Human contamination was lower in the KAPA-prepared
samples (0.01-0.02% of reads mapped) than in the Nextera-prepared samples (0.03-3.67%
in XT and 0.04-4.09% in Flex) (Figure 2C).
We included two negative control samples containing human RNA which were taken through
the complete PCR and sequencing process alongside the positive samples. More reads
were generated using the Nextera methods than the KAPA library preparation from these
negative control samples. The negative control samples prepared using the Nextera

methods had high levels of human sequences (74.21-83.3%) while the negative controls
prepared with KAPA showed low levels of human sequences (0.57% and 3.29%) (Figure
2D). A low percentage of reads can be mapped to SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2E), and after the
filtering and primer trimming steps of our pipeline many of the reads were removed,
suggesting they were low-quality or (in the case of the KAPA ligation-mediated preparation)
did not start with primer sequences (Supplementary Table 3).

Genome and amplicon coverage
As we use amplicons as our input material for sequencing, the coverage across the genome
will be influenced by the efficiency of the amplicon PCR. Figure 3 shows the median
normalised coverage for each amplicon, showing there was high variability between
amplicons. This data was produced using the ARTIC V2 amplicon set, which has known
problems with amplicons 24, 54, 64, 70, and 74 [22].
To determine if there were differences in amplicon coverage between the different library
preparation methods using the same input PCR, we compared the coverage of all amplicons
for each library prep method (normalising the data within each library). The plot suggests a
slight difference in the coverage between the Nextera and the KAPA library prep methods,
with the KAPA-prepared amplicons showing more amplicons with high coverage, but the
difference was not statistically significant (using the Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test with
Bonferroni correction for multiple testing) (Figure 4).

SNP calling
To see how library preparation method and coverage affect SNP calling, we first used all
reads to call SNPs against the reference genome. For each sample, the consensus
sequences generated from different library preparations gave identical SNPs relative to the
reference genome (6-9 SNPs depending on sample). Samples A and F had SNPs called in
the primer region for amplicon 97, and do show lower coverage at this amplicon across all
library preparation methods compared to other samples (Supplementary Figure 2).

Downsampled data
To determine how much sequence data is required, we downsampled the reads for each
sample to the same level and tested a range of read pairs between 400,000 and 10,000 to
determine the minimum number of reads needed to cover the whole genome and call all
SNPs in these samples.
Samples with 250,000 read pairs and above gave identical results to the full read sets when
calling SNPs against a reference. With 100,000 read pairs, a cluster of 3 SNPs at positions
28881-28883 in sample A was missed using the Nextera XT prep; however in all other cases
100,000 read pairs was sufficient to call all SNPs (Supplementary Figure 3).
We looked at the proportion of the genome where coverage falls below the levels needed for
variant calling. Figure 5 shows the number of bases which fall below 10X and 50X coverage
for different downsampled read sets. Different completeness thresholds have been used for

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.16.154286; this version posted June 16, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

different analyses - for instance, the Nextstrain platform [23] will filter out samples with
<27,000bp called [24], while GISAID [25] will mark as complete those strains with <29,000bp
called. We used these two thresholds to assess our data. With 10X coverage required, the
27,000bp threshold was achieved by as few as 25000 read pairs, while 29,000bp was
reached using 250,000 read pairs in all libraries prepared by the Nextera Flex or KAPA
methods, and 4 out of 6 libraries prepared using the Nextera XT library prep method. The
29,000bp threshold was not consistently reached at 50X coverage for any set of data, likely
due to amplicon dropout; the 27,000bp threshold was covered at 50X using 100,000 read
pairs in all libraries prepared by Nextera Flex or KAPA methods, and 5 out of 6 libraries
prepared using the Nextera XT method.
When we compare the three different library prep methods, at high numbers of read pairs
the results are comparable, however the KAPA and Nextera Flex methods give better
genome coverage at low numbers of read pairs than the Nextera XT method.
While we are primarily concerned with reporting the consensus variants in these samples,
amplicon sequencing is capable of reporting intrahost diversity [19]. We examined our
variant calls for evidence of intrahost diversity to determine if this was affected by library
prep methods. We identified all variants called with a frequency between 0.10 and 0.99
using a minimum depth of 50 and compared whether they were called across methods and
with the same frequency. A total of 24 positions were called as minority variants in one of six
samples, with the majority of variants falling around 10% frequency (Figure 6). Noticeably,
the same position was called as a minority variant in 5 of our 6 samples using the KAPA
library prep method, despite the samples showing few consensus shared variants. On
inspection of the alignment, the non-reference base calls were found only in negative strand
reads. This variant fell into a region which was covered only by negative strand reads in the
KAPA library prep, while in the Nextera preps there were reads from both strands and the
ratio of reads with this variant is lower (Supplementary Figure 4).
Of the four variants which were found at >20% frequency by all different library prep
methods, three show good concordance between the three methods. However, one variant,
a 4bp deletion at position 27693 which was validated by Sanger sequencing[26], is found at
a high frequency in the Nextera library prep samples and at a lower frequency in the KAPA
library prep sample. On inspection of the alignment, this is due to the variant falling in a
homopolymer tract which is 247bp from the start of amplicon 91 in our scheme. In the KAPA
library, as the indel falls near the end of the read on the positive strand, the bases are softclipped in the alignment and do not call the deletion, giving a frequency of 50% as only the
negative strand reads show the deletion (Supplementary Figure 5). As the reads in the
Nextera libraries have varying start positions, only a small number are soft-clipped and this
does not have a large effect on the variant frequency.

Discussion
By comparing the same SARS-CoV-2 samples across different library prep methods, we can
assess the effectiveness of the different methods to get complete genome coverage and
SNP calling. We conclude that all three methods give acceptable data, and at high coverage

levels the regions which cannot be called due to low coverage are more affected by the
success of the amplicon PCR and not by the library prep methods. Using a conservative
cutoff of 50X coverage at all positions, we could call over 95% of the genome using all
methods, and the same SNP calls were seen across all library prep methods, indicating that
the method of preparation should not affect base calls or downstream phylogenetic analysis.
We saw higher human DNA contamination in the Nextera library preparations, however this
did not affect the downstream analysis.
By including negative control samples alongside our positive samples, we could see that the
negative controls from the transposase-based Nextera methods and the ligation-based
KAPA method behave differently. While the transposase-based methods have a higher
number of reads in the negative controls, more of these reads are human contamination. A
small number of reads remain after the filtering and trimming stage, indicating that few high
quality SARS-CoV-2 reads were retained in these samples, and the small numbers
remaining may be due to index hopping from the positive samples. This suggests that the
recommendations of the ARTIC network be followed and unique dual indexes or unique
molecular indexes used for barcoding, along with including a negative and positive control
sample on each run [27].
Our PCR amplicons were generated with the ARTIC V2 primer set, which has known
amplicons which consistently drop out, and has already been replaced with an updated
version which should reduce these problems. While we saw amplicon drop-out in agreement
with those previously reported for this primer set in amplicons 64,70, and 74, we also saw
low coverage in amplicon 18, which was previously noted to have low coverage in ARTIC V1
due to primer dimer formation but not in V2. The presence of SNPs in the primer region for
amplicon 97 in two of our samples appears to affect PCR efficiency for this amplicon. While
our results are broadly in line with those previously reported, the unexpected dropout of
amplicon 18 suggests that amplicon efficiency should be further monitored, and locally
circulating sequence variants in primer regions may affect amplification of those amplicons.
We downsampled our data to determine a minimum level of coverage and read pairs needed
to generate usable data. The Nextera Flex and KAPA prep methods produced very similar
results in terms of SNP calling and genome coverage. The Nextera XT prep required a
higher number of read pairs to produce the same level of coverage.
250,000 read pairs using 250bp paired end reads was sufficient to call over 29,000bp of the
genome at 10X coverage with the Nextera Flex and KAPA methods. Assuming 24 million
read pairs are produced from a single MiSeq run using the MiSeq v2 reagent kit [28] , this
suggests that up to 96 samples could be pooled on a run. Using the V3 amplicon PCR
primers should improve the coverage figures and potentially allow for fewer reads to be
used. A lower threshold of calling 27,000bp would be reached by all of the Nextera Flex and
KAPA samples with only 100,000 read pairs per sample, and allow for a high number of
samples to be multiplexed on a single run by trading complete genome coverage for reduced
sequencing costs. However, as library preparation costs become a larger proportion of the
cost per sample, the savings may be small.
While we have few samples to investigate minority variant calls, our limited data shows that
while there is good agreement between different library preparation methods on variants

present at above 20% frequency, there are method-specific differences which are largely
due to differences in the positive and negative strand reads. Due to the nature of amplicon
sequencing, it is not possible to require reads from both strands to be confident of the
presence of a variant, and it is recommended to carefully filter and further investigate any
minority variants which appear to be present in reads from one strand only or are amplified
in only one amplicon.

Figure 2. Total number of reads and percentages of reads mapped to SARS-CoV-2 or
human reference genomes. Top row shows A) total reads, B) percentage mapped to SARSCoV-2 reference genome, and C) percentage mapped to the human reference genome for
six samples prepared using the three different library prep methods. The bottom row shows
D) total reads, E) percentage mapped to SARS-CoV-2 reference genome, and F)
percentage mapped to the human reference genome for two negative control (NTC) samples
prepared with the three different library prep methods.

Figure 3. Plot of median coverage for each amplicon across all positive samples. Dotted
lines mark 50x coverage (our target coverage level) and 10x coverage (minimum depth
needed to call variants in our pipeline). The dot-dash line marks the lower bound of coverage
in our samples. The bars plotted in pink are those which are known to have poor
amplification in the ARTIC v2 primer set.
