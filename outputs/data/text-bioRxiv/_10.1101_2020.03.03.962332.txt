Abstract

21

A new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, recently discovered in Wuhan, China, has caused over 74000

22

infection cases and 2000 deaths. Due to the rapidly growing cases and the unavailability of

23

specific therapy, there is a desperate need for vaccines to combat the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2. In

24

the present study, we performed an in silico approach based on the available virus genome to

25

identify the antigenic B-cell epitopes and human-leukocyte-antigen (HLA) restricted T-cell

26

epitopes. A total of 61 B-cell epitopes were initially identified, 19 of which with higher potential

27

immunogenicity were used for vaccine design. 499 T-cell epitopes were predicted that showed

28

affinity with the 34 most popular HLA alleles in Chinese population. Based on these epitopes, 30

29

vaccine candidates were designed and inspected against safety risks, including potential toxicity,

30

human homologous, pharmaceutical peptides and bioactive peptides. Majority of vaccine peptides

31

contained both B-cell and T-cell epitopes, which may interact with the most prevalent HLA alleles

32

accounting for ~99% of Chinese population. Docking analysis showed stable hydrogen bonds of

33

epitopes with their corresponding HLA alleles. In conclusion, these putative antigenic peptides

34

may elicit the resistance response to the viral infection. In vitro and in vivo experiments are

35

required to validate the effectiveness of these peptide vaccine.

1. Introduction

39

Since December 2019, Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China has become the center of an outbreak

40

of viral lung infections caused by a new type of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (previously named

41

2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization) (Gorbalenya, 2020; Joseph T Wu*, 2020;

42

Organization, 2020; Perlman, 2020).The outbreak has so far infected over 74000 patients, and has

43

spread to approximately 30 countries/regions worldwide. Comparisons of the genome sequences

44

of SARS-CoV-2 with other virus has shown 79.5% and 96% similarities at nucleotide level to

45

SARS-CoV and bat coronaviruses, respectively (Zhou et al., 2020), which suggested its probable

46

origin in bats (Benvenuto et al., 2020). The main clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 patients

47

are fever (≥38ºC), dry cough, low or normal peripheral white blood cell count, and low

48

lymphocyte count, known as novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP) or coronavirus

49

disease 2019 (COVID19) (Huang et al., 2020).

50

Currently, there is no approved therapeutics or vaccines available for the treatment of

51

COVID19 (Chen et al.). Due to lack of anti-viral drugs or vaccines, control measures have been

52

relying on the rapid detection and isolation of symptomatic cases (Chen et al.). In this context, a

53

safe and efficacious vaccine is urgently required. Traditional approaches for developing vaccines

54

waste much time in isolating, inactivating and injecting the microorganisms (or portions of them)

55

that cause disease. Fortunately, computation-based method enable us to start from analysis of viral

56

genome, without the need to grow pathogens and therefore speeding up the entire process.

57

Complete genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has finished and paved the way for the vaccine

58

development (Chen et al.). The genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes the spike protein, the membrane

59

protein, the envelope protein, the nucleocapsid protein and a few replication and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.962332; this version posted March 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

60

transcription-related enzymes. Given the lack of repairing mechanism of RNA virus replicase

61

complex, mutations are prone to occur during virus replication. The 4% nucleotide difference of

62

the virus isolated from Rhinolophus to that from human suggests that SARS-CoV-2 mutates

63

rapidly to achieve the host conversion (Jiayuan Chen, 2020). Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses

64

its receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein to bind to the host’s

65

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Chen et al.; Dong et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020; Zhou

66

et al., 2020). In terms of binding capacity, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is much stronger than

67

SARS-CoV and is considered to be between HKU3-4 which cannot bind to ACE2 receptor and

68

rSHC014 which presents the largest binding energy (Gralinski and Menachery, 2020; Wrapp et al.,

69

2020; Zhao et al., 2020). Consequently, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine can be developed targeting the

70

structural proteins, and in particular, the RBD region, following the strategy for the SARS-CoV

71

vaccine development (Babcock et al., 2004; Buchholz et al., 2004; He et al., 2005; Saif, 1993;

72

Tian et al., 2020).

73

An ideal vaccine may contain both B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes, with combination of

74

which vaccine is able to either induce specific humoral or cellular immune against pathogens

75

efficiently (Purcell et al., 2007). Since the development of a peptide vaccine against the virus

76

causing foot-and-mouth disease (Adam et al., 1978), the establishment of peptide synthesis

77

method by Lerner et al. (Lerner et al., 1981), along with the advent of a peptide vaccine design

78

combining T-cell and B-cell epitopes, has accelerated the vaccine development. In the present

79

study, we followed this in silico approach to identify the potential B-cell and T-cell epitope(s)

80

from the spike, envelope and membrane proteins that could be used as promising vaccines against

81

SARS-CoV-2.

2. Materials and Methods

84

2.1. Data retrieval

85

The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 was retrieved from the NCBI

86

database under the accession number MN908947. Gene and protein sequences were acquired

87

according to the annotation. In particular, the RBD region for the spike protein was referred to as

88

the fragment from 347 to 520 amino acid (aa) (Lu et al., 2020).

89

2.2. B-cell epitope prediction

90

The online tool in IEDB (Immune-Epitope-Database And Analysis-Resource) was used for the

91

analysis of the conserved regions of the candidate epitopes (Vita et al., 2015). Prediction of linear

92

B-cell epitopes was performed through Bepipred software (Jespersen et al., 2017). The antigenic

93

sites were determined with Kolaskar method (Chen et al., 2007). The surface accessible epitopes

94

were predicted by Emini tool (Almofti et al., 2018).

95

2.3. T-cell epitope prediction

96

The sequences of structural proteins were split into small fragments with a length of 9aa; their

97

binding affinity with the 34 most prevalent HLA alleles (>1% in the Chinese population according

98

to data obtained from the website for China Marrow Donor Program (CMDP)) was predicted

99

using netMHCpan (Hoof et al., 2009) and our in-house prediction software iNeo-Pred,

100

respectively. iNeo-Pred was trained on a large immune-peptide dataset, and achieved a better

101

performance in predicting binding affinity of epitopes to specific HLA alleles. Only the epitopes

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.962332; this version posted March 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

102

predicted by both tools were selected. Next, for each epitope, a HLA score was calculated based

103

on the frequencies of binding HLA alleles in Chinese population, which will be used as metrics to

104

select better candidates for downstream analysis.

105

2.4. Vaccine peptide design

106

The vaccine peptides were designed by our in-house tool iNeo-Design. First, the selected B-cell

107

epitopes and their adjacent T-cell epitopes were bridged to form candidate peptides with length no

108

more than 30aa. Meanwhile, to facilitate the peptide synthesis, vaccine peptide sequences were

109

optimized based on their hydrophobicity and acidity. To minimize the safety risk, peptides that

110

contained toxicity potential, human homologous region (full-length matches and identity > 95%),

111

or bioactive peptide were discarded.

112

Besides the vaccine peptides containing both B-cell epitopes and T-cell epitopes,

113

iNeo-Design also utilized all predicted T-cell epitopes to generate T-cell epitopes-only vaccine

114

peptides. For each vaccine candidate, the epitope counts and HLA score reflecting the population

115

coverage were calculated. Vaccine candidates with the higher epitope counts and HLA score were

116

considered to be preferable for the downstream analysis.

117

2.5. Structural analysis

118

The online server swiss-model was used to predict the 3D protein structures of viral proteins and

119

HLA molecules (Waterhouse et al., 2018). The online server PEP_FOLD was used to predict

120

T-cell epitopes’ structures (Lamiable et al., 2016). To display the interaction between T-cell

121

epitopes and HLA molecules, T-cell epitope models were docked to HLA molecules using

122

MDockPep (Xu et al., 2018). All predicted structures or models were decorated and displayed by

3. Results and Discussion

130

3.1. Prediction of B-cell epitopes

131

During the immune response against viral infection, B-cell takes in viral epitopes to recognize

132

viruses and activates defense responses. Recognition of B-cell epitopes depends on antigenicity,

133

accessibility of surface and predictions of linear epitope (Fieser et al., 1987). A total of 61 B-cell

134

epitopes were predicted, which seemed preferentially located within certain regions of each gene

135

(Figure 1; Figure 2; Table S1). Only 19 epitopes were exposed on the surface of the virion and had

136

a high antigenicity score, indicating their potentials in initiating immune response. Therefore, they

137

were considered to be promising vaccine candidates against B-cells. Among the 19 epitopes, 17

138

were longer than14 residues and located in the spike protein that contained RBD and functioned

139

in host cell binding (Table 1). The average Emini score for the 19 epitopes was 2.744, and the

140

average for Kolaskar (antigenicity) score was 1.015. Two epitopes were located within the RBD

141

region, while the one with the highest Kolaskar score (1.059), 1052-FPQSAPH-1058, was located

142

at position 1052aa of the spike protein.

143

3.2. Prediction of T-cell epitopes

144

The immune response of T-cell is considered as a long lasting response compared to B-cell where

145

the antigen might easily escape the antibody memory response (Black et al., 2010). Moreover, the

146

CD8+ T and CD4+ T-cell responses play a major role in antiviral immunity. It is therefore

147

important to design vaccines that can induce T-cell's immune response (Sesardic, 1993). A total of

148

499 T-cell epitopes were predicted on the spike protein (378 epitopes), the membrane protein (90

149

epitopes) and the envelop protein (31 epitopes); 48 of the 378 epitopes for the spike protein were

150

located in the RBD region (Figure 1; Table 2; Table S2). There is no preference in certain genes or

151

regions for T-cell epitope generation; no biased distribution of T-cell epitopes among HLA types

152

were observed either. Among all T-cell epitopes, the epitope 869-MIAQYTSAL-877 in the spike

153

protein was predicted to be able to bind to 17 HLA alleles. Most of the HLA alleles included in the

154

present study were covered by these vaccine candidates, which suggested a wide population

155

coverage.

156

In terms of the distribution of the predicted epitopes against different HLA haplotypes, no

157

significant differences were observed among different HLA haplotypes (Table S3). There were

158

287, 208 and 195 epitopes predicted to be able to bind to HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C haplotypes,

159

respectively. For the most popular five HLA types (HLA-A*11:01, HLA-A*24:02, HLA-C*07:02,

160

HLA-A*02:01 and HLA-B*46:01), the counts for epitopes with binding affinity were 51, 49, 115,

161

48 and 58.

162

3.3. Multi-epitope vaccine design

163

Based on the 19 B-cell epitopes and their 121 adjacent T-cell epitopes, 17 candidate vaccine

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.962332; this version posted March 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

164

peptides that contained both B-cell and T-cell epitopes were generated by our in-house software

165

iNeo-Design. Most of the 17 candidate vaccine peptides contained one B-cell epitopes, except for

166

AVEQDKNTQEVFAQVKQIYKTPPIKDFGG, which involved two B-cell epitopes and eight

167

T-cell epitopes, and AKNLNESLIDLQELGKYEQYIKWPWYIWKK, which contained two

168

B-cell

169

FKNLREFVFKNIDGYFKIYSKHTPINLV had the largest count of T-cell epitopes, whereas the

170

vaccine peptide SYGFQPTNGVGYQPYRVVVLSFELLHAPAT showed the highest HLA score,

indicating their wide population coverage and promising efficacy.

and

peptide

172

In addition to the vaccine candidates involved both B-cell and T-cell epitopes, we also

173

analysed the entire 499 core T-cell epitopes to generate another 102 vaccine peptides containing

174

T-cell epitopes only. Based on both the epitope counts and HLA score, we eventually selected 13

175

T-cell epitopes-only vaccine peptides.

176

Taken together, a total of 30 peptide vaccine candidates were designed (Table 3). 26 of them

177

were from the spike protein, two from the membrane protein and two from the envelop protein.

178

Five peptides were located in the RBD region, indicating they were likely to induce the production

179

of neutralizing antibody. The 30 vaccine peptides covered all structural proteins that may induce

180

immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in theory; and the multi-peptide strategy we applied would

181

better fit the genetic variability of the human immune system and reduce the risk of pathogen’s

182

escape through mutation (Skwarczynski and Toth, 2016).

183

3.4. Interaction of predicted peptides with HLA alleles

184

To further inspect the binding stability of T-cell epitopes against HLA alleles, the T-cell epitopes

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.962332; this version posted March 3, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

185

involved in the above designed vaccine peptides were selected to conduct an interaction analysis.

186

Figure 3 illustrated the docking results against the most popular HLA types for the two epitopes

187

from vaccines peptide 25 and 27 (Table 3; Table 4), which showed relatively higher HLA score.

188

The MDockPep scores were between -148 ~ -136, indicating that the predicted crystal structures

189

were stable. All epitopes were docked inside the catalytic pocket of the receptor protein. In

190

particular, the epitope 1220-FIAGLIAIV-1228 from the spike protein possessed 2-5 stable

191

hydrogen bonds with the HLA alleles; the epitope 4-FVSEETGTL-12 from the envelop protein

192

possessed 4~5 stable hydrogen bonds (Table 4). Taken together, the epitopes included in our

193

vaccine peptides can interact with the given HLA alleles by in silico prediction.

194
195

4. Conclusions

196

Vaccine design using an in silico prediction method is highly appreciated as it selects specific

197

epitopes in proteins than conventional methods. In the present study, this reverse vaccinology

198

approach was adopted to identify surface-exposed peptides, instead of targeting the whole

199

pathogen which is obviously less efficient and effective. Immunogenic regions of antigenic

200

epitopes of all proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 were screened to identify potential vaccine

201

candidates. As a result, 17 vaccine peptides involving both T-cell epitopes and B-cell epitopes as

202

well as 13 vaccine peptides involving T-cell epitopes only were successfully designed. These

203

multi-epitope vaccines provided excellent candidates for the development of vaccines against

204

SARS-CoV-2. Various formulation of vaccine can be rapidly manufactured, such as peptide, DNA

205

and mRNA. However in vitro and in vivo trials are required to achieve the effectiveness of these
