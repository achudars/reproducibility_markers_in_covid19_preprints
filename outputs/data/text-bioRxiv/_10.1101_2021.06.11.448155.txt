Background: Viral infections have a history of abrupt and severe eruptions through the
years in the form of pandemics. And yet, definitive therapies or preventive measures are
not present.
Purpose: Herbal medicines have been a source of various antiviral compounds. An
accelerated repurposing potential of antiviral herbs can provide usable drugs and identify
druggable targets. In this study, we dissect the anti-coronavirus activity of Cissampelos
pareira L (Cipa). using an integrative approach.
Methods: We analysed the signature similarities between predicted antiviral agents and
Cipa using the connectivity map (https://clue.io/). Next, we tested the anti-SARS-COV-2
activity of Cipa in vitro. A three-way comparative analysis of Cipa transcriptome, COVID-19
BALF transcriptome and CMAP signatures of small compounds was also performed.
Results: Several predicted antivirals showed a high positive connectivity score with Cipa
such as apcidin, emetine, homoharringtonine etc. We also observed 98% inhibition of
SARS-COV-2 replication in infected Vero cell cultures with the whole extract. Some of its
prominent pure constituents e.g pareirarine, cissamine, magnoflorine exhibited 40-80%
inhibition. Comparison of genes between BALF and Cipa showed an enrichment of
biological processes like transcription regulation and response to lipids, to be
downregulated in Cipa while being upregulated in COVID-19. CMAP also showed that
Triciribine, torin-1 and VU-0365114-2 had positive connectivity with BALF 1 and 2, and
negative connectivity with Cipa.

SARS-CoV-2, the severe acquired respiratory syndrome agent coronavirus 2, has taken
many lives in the past year and is continuing to create an unsafe environment. Along with
numerous mutations, fast transmission and a wide range of symptoms, lack of a definite
therapeutic intervention has made this virus all the more deadly. Many studies have been
conducted in order to recognize small compound therapeutics effective against SARS-CoV2. Interestingly, some estrogen receptor modulators and protein synthesis inhibitors
having potential antiviral against SARS-CoV2 have also been identified (1). It has been
shown that ESR1 as a drug target can modulate certain coronavirus associated genes. A
group recently demonstrated the downregulation of ACE2 by estrogen (2).

Cissampelos pareira L. is a commonly used hormone modulator which is used to treat
reproductive disorders and fever. It has also been found to inhibit three serotypes of
dengue (3) and its effect on various hormones has also been evidenced (4). In a previous
study we have observed that Cipa can act as both, a protein synthesis inhibitor and an
estrogen receptor inhibitor (5). Many of the drugs positively connected with Cipa have
been reported to be a potential antiviral agent. Since there were several overlaps between
the therapeutics predicted to be effective against SARS-CoV-2 and our formulation, we
decided explore the repurposing potential of Cipa for this current pandemic.

Transcriptome meta-analysis:
We obtained the raw RNA sequencing data from SARS-CoV-2 patients Broncho-alveolar
lavage fluid (BALF) 1 and 2 from the recent publications and analyzed them inhouse
(supplementary information 1.1). The gene expression data for Cissampelos pareira L. was
taken from (5), which can be accessed at GSE156445.
Functional enrichment and connectivity map of the differentially expressed genes.
The differentially expressed genes were analyzed for functional enrichment using enrichr
(6) and for similar signatures using clue.io (7). The results were then compared with Cipa
to find intersections between gene ontologies, enriched gene sets, and connectivity map
perturbations between upregulated genes of BALF 1 and 2 and downregulated genes of
Cipa and between downregulated genes of BALF 1 and 2 and upregulated genes of Cipa.
Enrichments were also done for the genes whose knockdown signatures score >90
connectivity with Cipa and then compared with the upregulated processes and gene sets in
SARS-CoV-2.

Cell culture, viral infection and drug treatment for inhibition of SARS-COV-2 by Cipa:
The effect of PE50 and PER was tested against the SARS-CoV2 (ASTM, 2015) in a 96-well
tissue culture plates that was seeded with Vero Cells 24 h prior to infection with SARSCoV2 (Indian/a3i clade/2020 isolate) in BSL3 facility. After treatment, RNA was isolated
using MagMAXTM Viral/Pathogen Extraction Kit (Applied Biosystems, Thermofisher)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The details of the experiment and RNA
isolation protocol are given in the supplementary information 1.3.
TaqMan Real-time RT-PCR assay for Detection of SARS-CoV-2:
The detection of genes specific to SARS-CoV2 was done using COVID-19 RT-qPCR Detection
Kit (Fosun 2019-nCoV qPCR, Shanghai Fosun Long March Medical Science Co. Ltd.)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (details in supplementary information 1.4).
The calculations for the relative viral RNA content and log reduced viral particles was
calculated using the linear regression equation obtained using the RNA extracted from the
known viral particles by RT-qPCR, using N, E and ORF1ab genes specific to SARS CoV2
virus. from the test sample (9).

Cissampelos pareira L. shows high positive connectivity with small compounds
predicted to inhibit SARS-CoV-2.
To assess which among the numerous small compounds predicted to have antiviral
potential against SARS-CoV2 in various studies might have similar signatures among the
same cell lines as Cipa, we queried the connectivity map. We observed 7 small compounds
to possess high signature similarity with Cipa. These include emetine (99.61), anisomycin
(99.58), cycloheximide (99.86), homoharringtonine (99.51), apcidin (86.32), ruxolitinib
(91.54), and sirolimus (95.45). These small compounds were predicted using different
methods in 4 different studies (Table 1).

Cipa whole extract and single molecule constituents can inhibit SARS-COV-2 in vitro
Since metanalysis highlighted an inhibitory potential of Cipa against SARS-COV-2, we tested
the effect of whole plant and root extracts of Cipa in Vero cell culture assays infected with
SARS-CoV-2. The relative viral RNA (%) was calculated by considering the values averaged
from N (Nucleoprotein), ORF1ab (19 non-structural proteins, NSP1-16), and E (Envelope)
viral genes. The whole plant aqueous extract showed a definite antiviral activity, evidenced
by decreased relative viral RNA content with a reduction by 57% at 100µg/ml where the
viral particle number reduced from 105.9 to 105.6 (Figure 1A-C).
Next, we wanted to see whether the Cipa pure constituents can inhibit SARS-COV-2. The
total alkaloid content in the extract was 46.4 mg/g with cissamine (18.6 mg/g) being the
major one, followed by magnoflorine (12.9 mg/g). The pure molecules namely hayatinin
(US-50), salutaridine (US-DR-CP-2), cissamine (US-CP-3), pareirarine (US-CP-5),
magnoflorine (US-CP-7), aqueous whole plant extract (PE), 50% hydroalcoholic whole
plant extract (PE50) and 50% hydroalcoholic root extract (PER) were tested against SARSCoV2 at 200 µM concentration showed relative viral RNA (%) to 44, 58, 45, 16, 63, 24, 2
and 2 respectively in comparison with the virus control (Figure 1D).
Cipa transcriptome oppositely regulates several biological pathways compared to
COVID-19 infected patient BALF transcriptome
We looked for the differentially expressed genes which were common between Cipa and
BALF samples from two studies (10, 11), hereby referred to as BALF-1 and BALF-2
respectively. We observed that 39 genes were common between Cipa and BALF-1 and
BALF-2, out of which 29 showed an opposite expression (Table S1). Individually, 134 genes
were common between Cipa and BALF-1, and 174 genes common between Cipa and BALF2. Upon functional enrichment analysis we observed that the genes enriched for regulation
of vascular endothelial growth were upregulated in both BALF-1 and 2 datasets while
being downregulated by Cipa. Similarly, while regulation of gene expression was
upregulated by Cipa it was downregulated in BALF-1 and BALF-2 data sets (Figure 2A-C).
The connectivity map analysis of the gene signatures of BALF-1 and BALF-2 comparison
with Cipa results revealed a number of small compounds that had high positive scores with
Cipa and negative scores with either BALF transcriptomes. We observed several small
compounds having opposite signature similarities between Cipa and BALF. Triciribine,
torin-1 and VU-0365114-2 were three compounds with negative scores for Cipa and
positive scores for both BALF 1 and 2 (Figure 2D). Also, knockdown signatures of a number
of genes were found to exhibit opposing scores between Cipa and BALF transcriptomes.
Some of these include, MICALL1, CRK, FKBP1A, CBX4, and FGR10P (Figure 2E).

Discussion:
SARS-COV-2 has shown a very diverse set of clinical presentations in various populations
and among genders within the same population. It has been shown that estrogen can
regulate the expression of ACE-2 receptors (2). Since Cipa appears to have ESR1
modulatory effects (5), and has been shown to have antiviral potential (3), we
hypothesized it may have inhibitory effect on the novel coronavirus. CMAP analysis of Cipa
transcriptome signatures highlights several small compounds having been predicted to
have inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2. Among these, emetine, homoharringtonine,
and cycloheximide are known translation inhibitors. These have also been shown to inhibit
Zika and Ebola (12), SARS and MERS (13), and Newcastle disease virus (14). Apcidin, an
HDAC inhibitor has been predicted to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in a recent study (15).
In vitro experiments for viral inhibition of SARS-COV-2, reveal that all whole plant extracts
of Cipa (aqueous and alcoholic) could inhibit the virus at least up to 60%. Hydroalcoholic
whole plant extract showed an inhibition of 98%. The single molecule constituents of Cipa
could also inhibit the viral particles, with pareirarine showing the highest inhibition of
80%. This showed that Cipa does have the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro.
Interestingly, the highest inhibition is shown by the whole plant hydroalcoholic extract
which comprises of various small compound constituents. This suggests a synergistic effect
of the constituents towards viral inhibition.
We also found that the signatures of the transcriptomic changes in Cipa treated MCF7 cells
and BALF from patients’ lungs, have interesting overlaps. Among the connected small
compounds triciribine, torin-1 and VU-0365114-2, triciribine has been shown to inhibit
Human Immunodeficiency virus sera types 1 and 2 (16). Another study has shown that VU0365114-2, which is a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M5 inhibitor, has repurposing
potential against SARS-CoV-2 (17). While mTOR inhibitor torin-1 may modulate immune
activity and enhance antiviral response, even against SARS-COV-2 (18).

In summary, we report here a framework applicable for repurposing of herbal
formulations using an integrated multi-pronged approach using transcriptome-based
connectivity mapping, in vitro validation and conjoint analysis with disease signatures. We
demonstrate the potential repurposing of Cissampelos pareira L for sars-cov-2 using this
approach.
