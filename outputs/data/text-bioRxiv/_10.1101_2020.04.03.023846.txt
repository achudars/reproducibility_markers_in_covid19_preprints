Summary

18
19

A novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, emerged in 2019 from Hubei region in China and rapidly

20

spread worldwide. As no approved therapeutics exists to treat Covid-19, the disease associated to SARS-

21

Cov-2, there is an urgent need to propose molecules that could quickly enter into clinics. Repurposing

22

of approved drugs is a strategy that can bypass the time consuming stages of drug development. In this

23

study, we screened the Prestwick Chemical Library® composed of 1,520 approved drugs in an infected

24

cell-based assay. 90 compounds were identified. The robustness of the screen was assessed by the

25

identification of drugs, such as Chloroquine derivatives and protease inhibitors, already in clinical trials.

26

The hits were sorted according to their chemical composition and their known therapeutic effect, then

27

EC50 and CC50 were determined for a subset of compounds. Several drugs, such as Azithromycine,

28

Opipramol, Quinidine or Omeprazol present antiviral potency with 2<EC50<20µM. By providing

29

new information on molecules inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro, this study could contribute

30

to the short-term repurposing of drugs against Covid-19.

Introduction

32
33

Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the

34

Nidovirales order that are mostly involved in gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infections.

35

Among them, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome

36

(MERS) CoVs that emerged in 2002 and 2013 respectively, have been associated with severe

37

human illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory distress syndromes (de Wit et al., 2016). In

38

December 2019, a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has emerged in the city of Wuhan and

39

quickly spread around the world. SARS-CoV-2 causes in human a viral infection, named

40

COVID-19, which is associated in some patients with severe respiratory diseases and

41

significant mortality rates, in particular in elderly populations (Li et al., 2020). While an

42

unknown fraction (most probably a majority) of infected people remain pauci- or asymptomatic,

43

some require hospitalization, sometimes in intensive care units, which may jeopardise health

44

systems during peak pandemic periods. In such a context, vaccines would represent great tools

45

to prevent or limit virus spread. However, vaccine development is a long process and COVID-

46

19 vaccines will most probably not be concretely available for mass usage, at least during the

47

first wave of the disease. Accordingly, the availability of efficient antiviral drugs would be of

48

utmost interest for the treatment of infected patients and possibly for preventive or preemptive

49

use. Regrettably, the current and unprecedented outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 occurs in an

50

unprepared world, with no firmly established identification of active molecules against beta-

51

coronaviruses (Callaway et al., 2020). There is thus an urgent necessity to provide hic et nunc

52

therapeutic solutions to limit viral infection. As the timeframe for a conventional drug

53

development is unrelated to the immediate needs, repurposing of drugs originally developed for

54

other viral infections or therapeutic uses is likely the fastest way to enter clinics. This fast track

55

drug development and validation lead to the initiation of numerous clinical trials for the

56

treatment of Covid19 (Li and De Clercq, 2020) but there is still a need to expand the number

57

of possible drug candidates to treat COVID19 and/or evaluate possible drug combinations to

58

potentiate the antiviral effects (Cheng et al., 2019). Whereas the number of clinical trials cannot

59

be extensively multiplied, libraries of “old” drugs can be screened in vitro in medium to high

60

throughput assays. Proof of concepts for drug repositioning against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV

61

or other viruses in in vitro assay already showed the relevance of this strategy (de Wilde et al.,

62

2014; Dyall et al., 2014; Mercorelli et al., 2018). In this study, we screened the 1,520 approved

63

and off-patent drugs of the Prestwick Chemical Library® in a SARS-CoV-2 infection cell-based

64

assay. The in vitro screening identified 90 drugs showing inhibition effect on the viral

65

replication at 10 M. Hits, selected from different classes of compounds, were then confirmed

66

by EC50 and CC50 determination.

Material and methods

69

Chemical library

70

The Prestwick Chemical Library® (hereafter named PCL) is a library of 1,520 off-patent small

71

molecules, mostly approved drugs (FDA, EMA and other agencies). The compounds are

72

provided at a concentration of 10mM in 100% DMSO.

73

Cell line

74

VeroE6 (ATCC CRL-1586) cells were grown in minimal essential medium (Life Technologies)

75

with 7 .5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), at 37°C with 5% CO2 with 1%

76

penicillin/streptomycin (PS, 5000U.mL−1 and 5000µg.mL−1 respectively; Life Technologies)

77

and supplemented with 1 % non-essential amino acids (Life Technologies).

78

Virus strain

79

SARS-CoV-2 strain BavPat1 was obtained from Pr Drosten through EVA GLOBAL

80

(https://www.european-virus-archive.com/). To prepare the virus working stock, a 25cm2

81

culture flask of confluent VeroE6 cells growing with MEM medium with 2.5% FBS (Life

82

Technologies) was inoculated at MOI 0.001. Cell supernatant medium was harvested at the

83

peak of infection and supplemented with 25mM HEPES (Sigma) before being stored frozen in

84

small aliquots at -80°C. All experiments were conducted in BSL3 laboratory.

85

Antiviral screen

86

One day prior to infection for the antiviral screening 5×104 VeroE6 cells were seeded in 100µL

87

assay medium (containing 2.5% FCS) in 96 well plates. The next day, a single dilution of each

88

compound of the PCL at 10µM final concentration was added to the cells (25µL/well, in 2.5%

89

FCS-containing medium). Six virus control wells were supplemented with 25µL medium

90

(positive controls hereafter named vc) and eight cell control wells were supplemented with

91

50µL of medium (negative controls, hereafter named nc). Two internal well controls of viral

92

inhibition were added, corresponding to the addition of 10µM arbidol (Sigma) in the infected

93

cell culture (arbidol controls, hereafter named arb). After 15 min, 25µL of a virus mix diluted

94

in 2.5% FCS-containing medium was added to the wells at MOI 0.002.

95

Three days after infection, cell supernatant media were discarded and CellTiter-Blue® reagent

96

(Promega) was added following the manufacturer’s instructions. Plates were incubated for 2

97

hours prior recording fluorescence (560/590nm) with a Tecan Infinite 200Pro machine. From

98

the measured OD590nm, the Inhibition Index was calculated as follows: first, cell viability for

99

compounds, vc and arb were calculated: (OD590nm value/mean OD590nm of nc)*100. For vc and

100

arb, mean cell viability were calculated. Then all cell viabilities were normalized by subtracting

101

mean vc. cell viability of the 96 well plates. Finally, Inhibition index was calculated as follows:

102

Inh. Index= normalized cell viability of the compound/normalized cell viability of arb in the

103

same 96 well plate. All compounds with Inhibition index values above 1 were considered as a

104

hit.

105

EC50 and CC50 determination

106

One day prior to infection, 5×104 VeroE6 cells were seeded in 100µL assay medium

107

(containing 2.5% FCS) in 96 well plates. The next day, seven 2-fold serial dilutions of

108

compounds (0.6µM to 40µM, in triplicate) were added to the cells (25µL/well, in assay

109

medium). Four virus control wells were supplemented with 25µL of assay medium. After 15

110

min, 25µL of a virus mix diluted in medium was added to the wells. The amount of virus

111

working stock used was calibrated prior to the assay, based on a replication kinetics, so that the

112

replication growth is still in the exponential growth phase for the readout as previously

113

described (Delang et al., 2016; Touret et al., 2019). Four cell control wells (i.e. with no virus)

114

were supplemented with 50µL of assay medium. On each plate a control compound

115

(Remdesivir, BLDpharm) was added in duplicate with seven 2-fold serial dilutions (0.16µM to

116

20µM, in duplicate). Plates were incubated for 2 days at 37°C prior to quantification of the viral

117

genome by real-time RT-PCR. To do so, 100µL of viral supernatant was collected in S-Block

118

(Qiagen) previously loaded with VXL lysis buffer containing proteinase K and RNA carrier.

119

RNA extraction was performed using the Qiacube HT automat and the Cador Pathogen 96 HT

120

kit following manufacturer instruction. Viral RNA was quantified by real-time RT-qPCR

121

(EXPRESS One-Step Superscript™ qRT-PCR Kit, universal Invitrogen using 3.5µL of RNA

122

and 6.5µL of RT qPCR mix and standard fast cycling parameters, i.e., 10min at 50°C, 2 min at

123

95°C, and 40 amplification cycles (95°C for 3 sec followed by 30sec at 60°C). Quantification

124

was provided by four 2 log serial dilutions of an appropriate T7-generated synthetic RNA

125

standard of known quantities (102 to 108 copies). RT-qPCR reactions were performed on

which target SARS-CoV-2 N gene, were: Fw: GGCCGCAAATTGCACAAT ; Rev :

130

50% and 90% effective concentrations (EC50, EC90; compound concentration required to

131

inhibit viral RNA replication by 50% and 90%) were determined using logarithmic

132

interpolation as previously described (Touret et al., 2019). For the evaluation of the CC50 (the

133

concentration that reduces the total cell number by 50%), the same culture conditions were set

134

as for the determination of the EC50, without addition of the virus, and cell viability was

135

measured using CellTiter Blue® (Promega) as previously described for the screening. CC50

136

was determined using logarithmic interpolation. All data obtained were analyzed using Graph

137

pad prism 7 software (Graph pad software). All graphical representations were also performed

138

on Graph pad prism 7 software.

139

Results and discussion

140

We developed a HTS SARS-CoV-2 replication inhibition assay based on the measurement of

141

the cell viability 3 days after cell infection with a MOI of 0.002. Prior to the screening, we

142

evaluated the antiviral effect of arbidol, a broad spectrum antiviral compounds that blokes the

143

viral entry of many enveloped viruses (Blaising et al., 2014). In our experimental conditions,

144

we demonstrated that 10µM arbidol limit the SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to around 70-90%

145

cell viability, with a EC50 of 10.7µM. This compound was next used as reference compounds

146

in order to calculate the inhibition index (Inh. Index).

147

We next tested the Prestwick Chemical Library® (PCL®) composed of 1,520 approved drugs

148

at a final concentration of 10µM. The cell viability was determined and we calculated the

149

relative value of inhibition potency compared to arbidol. Among the 1,520 compounds of the

150

PCL®, 90 compounds showed equal or more potent inhibition than arbidol with an Inh. Index

151

≥ 1 (5.85 % positive hits) (Fig.1), and the mean Inh. Index of the library was 0.28 (Table 1 of

152

the supplemental data). As the threshold for the selection is arbitrary, the raw data for each

153

compound of the PCL® is presented in the supplemental data, in order to allow the scientific

154

community to further analyse the results and possibly rescue molecules of interest.

155

Among the selected hits, we first identified drugs previously demonstrated to inhibit in vitro

156

the SAR-CoV2 replication. Accordingly, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine (Liu et al.,

157

2020; Wang et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020) were shown to limit SARS-CoV-2 replication with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.023846; this version posted April 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

158

a Inh. Index of 1.35 and 1.43 respectively. In addition to chloroquine derivatives, two hits are

159

also currently evaluated in different clinical trials, namely Darunavir and Azythromycine.

160

These observations assessed the robustness of the screening assay. In order to further

161

consolidate the results provided by the assay, EC50 was determined on a set of selected

162

compounds. Whereas the screening relied on the quantification of cytopathic effect (CPE) using

163

CellTiter Blue® providing qualitative information on the viral infection, EC50 determination

164

were based on the quantification of the viral genome by Real-Time RT-PCR (Touret et al.,

165

2019). For this assay Remdesivir was used as a control compound for validation, with an EC50

166

of 1.6µM (Table 1), a value in agreement with previously published data (Wang et al., 2020).

167

From the 90 selected hits (Table 2), some were arbitrary removed after visual inspection of their

168

initial therapeutic use or strong side effects (ophthalmic treatment, topical administration,

169

teratogenic effect …). The compounds were organised in 12 groups by structural similarity

170

and/or therapeutic class including ten steroids (mainly sex steroids used for endocrine therapy

171

and corticosteroids with anti-inflammatory properties), two

172

displaying a variety of pharmacologic actions such as vasodilatator for one and anti-ulcer for

173

the other), two proton pump inhibitors (PPIs used as anti-ulcer agents), two antiretrovirals (HIV

174

anti-protease and anti-integrase), twelve antibacterial drugs (including fluoroquinolone,

175

oxazolidinone, macrolide and beta-lactam derivatives among others), fifteen cardiovascular

176

drugs (antiarrhythmic, vasodilatator and antihypertensive agents including ion channel

177

blockers, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE), angiotensin II receptor inhibitors,

178

and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers), two opioids plus sixteen non-opioid CNS drugs (that

179

display a variety of pharmacologic actions such as antipsychotic, antidepressant,

180

antiparkinsonian, anti-alzheimer…), six neuromuscular-blocking drugs (including muscle

181

relaxant and local anesthesic agents), three respiratory system drugs (mostly used as a

182

bronchodilator in the treatment of asthma and COPD), three allergy medications (with

183

antihistaminic and antiemetic properties), three antiparasitic drugs (more specifically

184

antimalarial agents), and fourteen unrelated drugs (used in ophthalmology, dermatology and

185

other isolated pathologies).

186

Interestingly, based on the SARS-Cov-2 infection cycle, one can infer that some of the

187

identified molecules may inhibit specific steps of the virus replication cycle. This is illustrated

188

for example by Candesartan, Olmesartan and Ambrisentan which interfer with angiotensin

189

pathways, that play a key role in virus entry as the SARS-CoV2 Spike protein is known to bind

190

to the cellular Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) (Kuster et al., 2020; Lan et

prostaglandins (both PGE1

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.03.023846; this version posted April 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

191

al., 2020). We also noted that 4 compounds (Omeprazole, Vonoprazan, Chloroquine

192

diphosphate and Hydroxychloroquine sulfate) have been demonstrated to increase the pH of

193

endosomial/golgian pathway either by inhibiting ATPase proton pomp, or by buffering the pH.

194

We can thus expect that such endosomial pH modification would limit the processing of the

195

Spike protein by endosomal proteases and in turn bloke the virus entry mediated by membrane

196

fusion process. Finally, we also identified Darunavir, a HIV protease inhibitor might interfere

197

with viral polyprotein processing during the replication cycle. This analysis identified at least

198

three possible steps of the viral infection that can be targeted by approved drugs.

199

We next aimed at determining the EC50 of 16 drugs selected from the different groups. Whereas

200

EC50 could be determined for 10 of them (Table 1, Fig 2), low to no antiviral effect (EC50 ≥

201

40µM) was observed for Darunavir, Levalbuterol, Olmesartan, Ambrisentan and Ranolazine.

202

As the compounds are selected from a screening based on the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2-

203

mediated CPE, we cannot exclude that these compounds have no antiviral effect but rather

204

protect the cells from CPE. In addition Artenimol was rejected as it showed toxicity at 20µM

205

concentration, in the same range of the antiviral effect. In conclusion, the screening of the

206

approved compounds identified a set of molecules showing inhibition on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro

207

replication. Some of these experimentally selected candidates, with EC50 at the 2-20 µM range

208

may provide information to guide the choice for downstream experiments and validation, or

209

initiate medicinal chemistry projects to find more potent derivatives.
