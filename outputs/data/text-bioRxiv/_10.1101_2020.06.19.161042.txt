Abstract:
There are an urgent need for antivirals to treat the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. To identify
new candidates we screened a repurposing library of ~3,000 drugs. Screening in Vero cells
found few antivirals, while screening in human Huh7.5 cells validated 23 diverse antiviral drugs.
Extending our studies to lung epithelial cells, we found that there are major differences in drug
sensitivity and entry pathways used by SARS-CoV-2 in these cells. Entry in lung epithelial Calu3 cells is pH-independent and requires TMPRSS2, while entry in Vero and Huh7.5 cells requires
low pH and triggering by acid-dependent endosomal proteases. Moreover, we found 9 drugs are
antiviral in lung cells, 7 of which have been tested in humans, and 3 are FDA approved
including Cyclosporine which we found is targeting Cyclophilin rather than Calcineurin for its
antiviral activity. These antivirals reveal essential host targets and have the potential for rapid
clinical implementation.

Introduction
Coronaviruses represent a large group of medically relevant viruses were historically associated
with the common cold. However, in recent years, members of the coronavirus family have
emerged from animal reservoirs into humans and have caused novel diseases (1). First, Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) emerged in China in 2003, followed by Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in 2012 (2, 3). While SARS was, in the end eradicated,
MERS continues to cause infections in the Middle East. Beginning in December 2019, into
continuing into January 2020, it became clear that a new respiratory virus was spreading in
Wuhan, China. Rapid sequencing efforts revealed a coronavirus closely related to SARS, and
was named SARS-CoV-2 (4). Unfortunately, this virus is highly infectious and has spread
rapidly around the world.
Identification of broadly acting SARS-CoV-2 antivirals is essential to clinically address SARSCoV-2 infections. A potential route to candidate antivirals is through the deployment of drugs
that show activity against related viruses. Previous studies found that the antiviral drug
remdesivir, which was developed against the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of Ebola virus,
was also active against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, with promising results in clinical trials (5-7).
Chloroquine, and its derivatives including hydroxychloroquine are approved for use in malaria,
and many in vitro studies have found that these drugs are also active against coronaviruses,
including SARS-CoV-2 (8, 9). This led to early adoption of these agents to treat COVID-19 (the

disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection); however, little efficacy of these agents has been
demonstrated in subsequent clinical trials (10). It remains unclear why these agents have not
been more active in humans.
There are currently more than 3000 FDA approved drugs, and many others that have been
tested in humans. We created an in-house library of 3059 drugs including ~1000 FDA approved
drugs and ~2100 drug-like molecules against defined molecular targets with validated
pharmacological activity. In addition, we purchased drugs with reported anti-SARS-CoV-2
activity (e.g. remdesivir). Viruses encode unique proteins essential for infection, and most
approved antivirals target these virally encoded essential targets. This class of antivirals has
been termed direct-acting antivirals. Viruses are also dependent on host cellular machineries for
successful infection, and drugs that block these activities are host-targeted antivirals. Given our
dearth of effective treatments, we developed a screening platform that would allow us to identify
both direct-acting and host-targeted antivirals that can be potentially repurposed for use against
SARS-CoV-2 (11).
We developed a specific and sensitive assay to quantify viral infection using a cell-based highcontent approach. We began our studies in African green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops)
kidney epithelial cells (Vero) because they are routinely used to propagate SARS-CoV-2. They
are robustly infected, and thus Vero cells are widely used as a model system to screen for
antivirals (8, 12-14). We screened our in-house repurposing library, identifying only six drugs
that were antiviral with low toxicity in the primary screen. Given how few candidates emerged,
we reasoned that human cells might be a better model of infection and thus tested a panel of
human cell lines to identify cells that are easy to grow, and permissive to infection. We found
that the human hepatocyte cell line Huh7.5 was readily infected with SARS-CoV-2. Screening in
this human cell line we validated 23 drugs that were active in dose-response experiments and
showed a favorable selective index versus toxicity (15). These candidates targeted a wide
variety of cellular activities, but few were active in Vero cells. However, one class, the
chloroquines and their derivatives were active in both cell types.
The entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 has only begun to be elucidated with much of what we know
being inferred from studies of the related SARS-CoV-1(16, 17). The coronavirus glycoprotein, or
Spike, requires proteolytic processing for entry (16, 18, 19) . This processing can occur outside
the cell, or within the endolysosomal compartment (16, 19). Both SARS-CoV-1 and -2 engage
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their plasma membrane receptor (20-22) . Upon
binding, the viruses along with the receptor are endocytosed into the cell into a low pH
endosomal compartment where there are proteases, including cathepsins, that can cleave
Spike and allow for entry into the cytosol (23-25). Since cathepsins require a low pH for activity,
chloroquine and its derivatives that neutralize this low pH can effectively block viral entry (2325). Recent studies have also identified a plasma membrane-associated serine protease,
TMPRSS2, is active against Spike, cleaving the protein extracellularly thereby bypassing the
requirement for endosomal proteases (26-28). Whether SARS-CoV-2 enters through different
routes in different cell types remains unclear.
Lung epithelial cells are the major cellular target for SARS-CoV-2 in vivo and have been used to
explore the role of TMPRSS2 in infection. Perhaps surprisingly, while we found remdesivir was
antiviral in Calu-3, hydroxychloroquine was not. Since a panel of quinolines had no activity in
Calu-3 cells, these data suggest that entry in lung epithelial cells is independent of low-pH
processing in the endosomal compartment. In contrast, the TMPRSS2 inhibitor camostat was
highly active in Calu-3 cells but inactive in Vero and Huh7.5 cells. These data demonstrate
distinct modes of entry in lung cells (21). Further, these data suggest that there may be other

fundamentally different cellular requirements in different cell types. We screened our 23
validated candidates in Calu-3 cells and found only 9 drugs showed activity, including 3 FDA
approved drugs: Cyclosporine, Dacomitinib and Salinomycin. In additional studies, we found
that cyclosporine analogs that target Cyclophilin A were active against SARS-CoV-2, but not
compounds that target Calcineurin. Identifying broadly acting antivirals is essential to move
forward with clinical treatments for SARS-CoV-2.
Results:

Vero cells are permissive to infection and can be used for antiviral screening for direct
acting antivirals
SARS-CoV-2 is routinely propagated in Vero E6 cells (12, 14, 26). When growing the virus in
either Vero E6 or Vero CCL81 cells, two different strains of Vero cells from ATCC, we observed
that SARS-CoV-2 is cytopathic in Vero E6, but not in Vero CCL81 (data not shown) (12).
Moreover, viral stocks propagated from either of these cells produced similar titers of virus
(1x107 PFU/mL) suggesting that viral replication and cytotoxicity are separable. Therefore, we
set out to develop a quantitative microscopy-based assay to measure the level of replication of
SARS-CoV-2 more directly in infected cells, and we chose Vero CCL81 to uncouple toxicity
from infection. We first validated that our antibodies could detect infection of SARS-CoV-2. We
used an antibody to dsRNA, and to SARS-CoV-2 Spike (Figure 1a) (29) (30).
We created an in-house library of 3059 drugs purchased from Selleckchem. This library
contains ~1000 FDA approved drugs and ~2100 drug-like molecules against defined molecular
targets with validated pharmacological activity. The library contains 678 known kinase inhibitors,
435 annotated cancer therapeutics, 190 epigenetic regulators, 411 anti-viral/infectives, 596
GPCR and ion channel regulators. The remaining compounds falling into diverse target classes.
We next optimized the dose and timing of infection by performing dose-response studies with
known antivirals. Indeed, we found that hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir were active in Vero
cells and presented with little cytotoxicity at the active doses (Figure 1b) (8). Next, we validated
the assay metrics, and observed a Z’=0.7 (Figure S1) (31).
We used this assay pipeline to screen our in-house repurposing library in 384 well plates at a
final concentration of 1 µM (Figure 1c) (32). We quantified the percentage of infected cells as
well as the total cell number per well, to allow for exclusion of toxic compounds. We robustly
identified the positive control remdesivir as antiviral (Figure S1) (8). Using a threshold of <40%
infection and >80% viability, as compared to the vehicle control, we identified only six drugs that
were antiviral in our primary screen (Table S1). This included the natural product
nanchangmycin, which we previously found in a drug repurposing screen against Zika virus
(32). Nanchangmycin was broadly antiviral against viruses that enter cells through endocytosis,
consistent with the role of endosomal acidification for SARS-CoV-2 entry in these cells (32). We
then repurchased powders and validated four of these candidates in a dose-response assays
where we observed antiviral activity in the absence of toxicity (Figure 1d).
Human hepatocyte Huh7.5 cells are permissive to infection and can be used to identify
antivirals
Since Vero cells are derived from African green monkeys, we set out to identify a human cell
line permissive to infection. To this end, we infected a panel of human cell lines with SARSCoV-2 and monitored infection by microscopy. We initially tested A549, Calu-1, Huh7, Huh7.5,

HepG2, HaCaT, IMR90, NCI-H292, CFBE41o, and U2OS cells. We detected less than 1%
infection of A549, Calu-1, Huh7, HepG2, HaCaT, IMR90, NCI-H292, CFBE41o, and U2OS cells
(data not shown). Interestingly, while Huh7 were largely non-permissive, the derivative cell line
Huh7.5 cells was permissive to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 2a). Huh7.5 cells are defective in innate
immune signaling (RIG-I) and are known to be more permissive to many viruses, including
Hepatitis C virus(15). Remdesivir and hydroxylchloroquine were antiviral against SARS-CoV-2
in Huh7.5 cells with IC50s that were greater than 10-fold lower than those observed in Vero
cells (Fig 2b). We also found that nanchangmycin was antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 in Huh7.5
cells (Fig S2).These observations suggest that Huh7.5 cells may be more sensitive to some
classes of inhibitors, and may reveal antivirals that are selectively active against human targets.
We optimized our image-based assay in Huh7.5 cells using remdesivir and observed a Z’=0.61
(Fig S3) (31). We screened our repurposing library at 500nM quantifying both the percentage of
infected cells as well as cell number to exclude toxic compounds (Fig 2c). We found 33 drugs
had antiviral activity in the absence of cytotoxicity (<40% infection, >80% viability, as compared
to vehicle control) (Table S2). This included three of the six drugs identified in Vero cells: Z-FAFMK, Y-320 and Salinomycin.
We repurchased powders for 32 drugs and tested their activity in dose-response assays in
Huh7.5 cells against SARS-CoV-2. Cell number and the percent of infected cells were
quantified. Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine were used as positive controls and vehicle
controls (DMSO) was included as a negative control (8). Of those tested, 23 drugs showed
activity and fell into diverse classes (Fig 2d). Dose-response curves are shown for 23
candidates and the IC50s and CC50s were calculated (Fig 2e). The Selectivity Index (SI, ratio
between antiviral and cytotoxicity potencies) was calculated and the 23 candidates were
antiviral with SI>3 (Figure 2e, Table S3). Dose-responses curves for the other candidates that
did not validate in Huh7.5 cells are shown in Fig S4.
Direct-acting antivirals are likely to be active against the virus in multiple cell types, as was
observed for remdesivir. In addition, host-directed antivirals that target key steps in the viral
lifecycle and are highly conserved and broadly expressed are also likely to emerge across cell
types. One example is the endosomal acidification blocker hydroxychloroquine which indeed
scored as antiviral in both cell types (9, 23, 24). In total, we identified three drugs as antiviral in
both screens. We performed dose-responses in Vero cells against the candidates from the
Huh7.5 screen. We found that 5 additional compounds were antiviral in Vero cells with a SI>3,
AZD8055, BIX01294, Ebastine, MG-132, and WYE-125132, albeit at higher concentrations
(Figure S5). However, the majority of the antivirals that were validated in Huh7.5 cells were not
active in Vero cells.
Lung epithelial cells show differences in drug sensitivities
We next focused on lung epithelial models as these are the most relevant to human infections.
We found that a number of lung-derived epithelial cell lines were refractory to infection (eg
A549, Calu-1, NCI-H292, CFBE41o). However, we found that Calu-3 cells, that have been
shown to be permissive for many coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, were highly readily
infected (Fig 3a) (14, 26, 33). We optimized assays using Calu-3 cells and tested their
sensitivity to remdesivir and hydroxycholorquine. As expected, we found that while the direct
acting antiviral remdesivir was antiviral; however, hydroxychloroquine had little or no activity in
Calu-3 cells (Fig 3b). This led us to test the antiviral activity of a panel of chloroquine derivatives
and we found that none of these had activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 3c), while these
compounds are antiviral in both Vero cells and Huh7.5 cells (Fig 3d). This suggests that there

are major differences in the requirement for endosomal acidification during infection of SARSCoV-2 in lung epithelial cells.
Endosomal acidification is thought to be required for SARS-CoV-2 entry to maintain the low pH
necessary for endosomal cysteine protease activity required for priming Spike for membrane
fusion (26). Consistent with the requirement for acidification in Vero and Huh7.5, the cathepsin
inhibitor Z-FA-FMK emerged as antiviral in both cell types (Fig 1d, Fig 2e). We tested Z-FA-FMK
in Calu-3 cells and found that it had no antiviral activity (Fig 3d), consistent with a lack of a
requirement for endosomal acidification. Recent studies found the plasma membraneassociated serine protease, TMPRSS2, can prime the viral glycoprotein for entry in lung
epithelial cells (26). Therefore, we tested the role of TMPRSS2 by treating cells with the inhibitor
camostat. We found that camostat was antiviral in Calu-3 cells but had no activity in either Vero
or Huh7.5 cells (Figure 3e-f) (26). Moreover, the main endosomal kinase Phosphatidylinositiol3-Phosphate/Phosphatidylinositol 5- kinase, PIKfyve, promotes internalization of diverse viruses
and was recently shown to impact entry of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 in HeLa cells
(34). Using the PIKfyve inhibitor apilimod, we found that PIKfyve promotes infection of SARSCoV-2 in Huh7.5 and Vero cells, with little importance Calu-3 cells (Fig S6). These data suggest
that the entry pathway used by SARS-CoV-2 is cell-type specific.
Nine candidates are antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 in lung epithelial cells
To determine which of the 23 antiviral candidates validated in Huh7.5 cells also had antiviral
activity in Calu-3 cells we performed dose-response studies. We found that 9 drugs were
antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 cells with a selectivity index greater than 2 (Fig 4).
These include: two drugs with unclear targets (Salinomycin, Y-320), kinase inhibitors (AZD8055,
bemcentinib, dacomitinib, WYE-125132), histamine receptor inhibitor (ebastine), iron chelator
Dp44mT, and the cyclophilin inhibitor cyclosporine. Many kinase inhibitors were quite potent,
suggesting an important role in intracellular signaling for infection. The other drugs tested in
Calu-3 with a SI<3 are shown in Fig S7. The full table of candidates from the Huh7.5 screen
with IC50, CC50 and SI are shown in Figure S8.
Cyclosporine is antiviral likely through interactions with cyclophilins
Cyclosporine is an FDA approved generic drug that is readily available and showed a submicromolar IC50 with high selectivity in both Huh7.5 and Calu-3 cells (Fig 3, Fig 4, Fig S8).
Cyclosporine binds Cyclophilin A and prevents activation of the phosphatase Calcineurin which
is required for the nuclear translocation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) (35-37).
Inhibition of this pathway in T cells is used as an immunosuppressant (38). Cyclosporins have
been shown to have antiviral activity against a wide variety of viruses, including other
coronaviruses (39-52). The activity of Cyclosporine against previously studied coronaviruses is
Cyclophilin-dependent and independent of Calcineurin (50, 51). We set out to perform initial
structure-activity relationships (SAR) and to determine if this activity was through its inhibition of
Cyclophilin or inhibition of Calcineurin. For these studies, we obtained a panel of Cyclosporine
analogs including Cyclosporin A, Cyclosporin B, Cyclosporin C, Cyclosporin H and
Isocyclosoporin A (53). We found that Isocyclosporin A, Cyclosporin A, Cyclosporin B, and
Cyclosporin C were active with increasing IC50s (Fig 5a-c). Cyclosporine H, shows only weak
binding to Cyclophilin A, and has no immunosuppressant activity, as it does not inhibit the
phosphatase activity of Calcineurin (53, 54). Cyclosporin H has a log reduction in activity
compared to Cyclosporine, but retains some activity. PSC 833 is a non-immunosuppressant
derivative of cyclosporine that does not inhibit Calcineurin, has a similar activity to Cyclosporin
C(55). TMN355 is a Cyclophilin A inhibitor that is 27 times more potent than Cyclosporine A in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.19.161042; this version posted June 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

inhibiting the prolyl isomerase activity of cyclophilin A (56). We found the latter to lack antiviral
activity, suggesting that the enzymatic activity of Cyclophilin A is dispensable.
We further validated that cyclosporine is antiviral in both cell types by performing RT-qPCR (Fig
5d). In addition, NIM811 is another non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine derivative of
cyclosporine, and we found that it is potently antiviral (Fig 5e), further suggesting that the
antiviral activity is Cyclophilin-dependent and separable from Calcineurin. Strikingly, the activity
of this panel of drugs are similar in the two cell lines. These data suggest that Cyclosporine has
the same target and mechanism-of-action. We also found that none of these drugs are antiviral
in Vero cells (Figure S9).
To further assess the mechanism by which Cyclosporine is antiviral, we tested FK506, an
inhibitor of Calcineurin. FK506 binds the related immunophilin FKBP, rather than Cyclophilin A,
to block the phosphatase activity of Calcineurin, and thus is also a potent immunosuppressant
(57). We found that FK506 has no activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 5a-c). Moreover, since one
of the major targets of Calcineurin is the activation of NFAT, we also tested whether an NFAT
inhibitor impacted viral infection (58). We found that the NFAT inhibitor had no effect on
infection (Fig 5a-c). Altogether, we found that cyclosporins are potent antivirals against SARSCoV-2 in lung epithelial cells, and that this activity is independent of Calcineurin and NFAT.
Discussion:
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to devastating global morbidity and mortality, creating
an immediate need for new therapeutics and vaccines. Repurposing existing drugs can allow for
rapid deployment of therapeutics that have already been tested in humans (59). Remdesivir was
developed against the Ebola virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and was also found to
have robust activity against SARS-CoV-2 (8). Importantly, we found that remdesivir is active
against SARS-CoV-2 across cell types. Chloroquine and hydroxychlorquine have been used for
decades to treat malaria and have been shown to have in vitro antiviral activity against SARSCoV-2 (8, 9). However, we find that this antiviral activity is cell-type specific. Lung epithelial cells
are resistant to these drugs, and this may explain the lack of efficacy seen in many trials (10).
To determine if there are additional drugs that are active against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, we
screened a repurposing library that includes ~1000 FDA approved drugs and ~1000 additional
drugs that have been tested in humans. Repurposing can be used to reveal new and similar
pathways and targets, but also the time and monetary investment associated with repurposing
is potentially less since these drugs often bypass Phase-1 trials (60, 61). Initial screens in Vero
cells yielded few active drugs, leading us to pursue a screen in human Huh7.5 cells, a
transformed hepatocyte line deficient in innate immune signaling. Using this model system, we
identified 33 drugs, and validated 23 with dose-response assays. This includes many drugs that
were previously shown to have activity against other coronaviruses (tetrandrine, cepharanthine,
cyclosporine, alixostatin, MG132, salinomycin), and SARS-CoV-2 (salinomycin, tetrandrine,
cepharanthine, cyclosporine, ebastine) (13, 40, 50, 54, 62-68).
The 23 drugs fall into distinct classes and most have known targets. However, two drugs that
were active across cell types, Salinomycin and Y-320, do not have clear targets. Salinomycin, is
a polyether antibiotic and chemotherapy drug, that has been shown to be antiviral against many
viruses, including coronaviruses (13, 68-70). Salinomycin was also identified in a Vero cell
screen (13). Mechanistically, some studies have suggested that Salinomycin is an ionophore
that can attenuate viral entry by disrupting the acidification of the endosome (71). Other studies
have implicated Salinomycin in ER stress (72). Studies in mice have shown antiviral activity

against influenza (71). Salinomycin has also been characterized as an activator of autophagy,
which may influence SARS-CoV-2 infection (73, 74) (75). Y-320 is a phenylpyrazoleanilide
immunomodulatory agent that has been shown to inhibit IL-17 production by T cells and has
activity in monkeys (76). Interestingly, treatment with Y-320 is associated with decreased IL-6
production, a cytokine that is thought to be highly expressed in SARS-CoV-2 infection (76-78).
However, it is unclear how Y-320 could attenuate SARS-CoV-2 in non-immune cells.
Ebastine is a potent H1-histamine receptor antagonist, used for allergic disorders outside of the
US, particularly in Asia (79). We found that ebastine is antiviral in all three cell types, although
10-fold less active in Vero cells (13). Ebastine is orally available with few side effects and there
are there clinical trials underway in China testing whether ebastine can impact COVID-19
outcomes (80). Since other H1-histamine receptor antagonists were not active, it is unclear why
this particular agent is more effective at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, ebastine
and its active metabolite, carebastine, are reported to inhibit expression of IL-6, while many
other H1-histamine receptor antagonists do not (81, 82).
We also identified 6 protease inhibitors as antiviral in Huh7.5 cells. Two cysteine protease
inhibitors, Z-FA-FMK and MG-132, had activity in both Vero and Huh7.5 cells. None of the
protease inhibitors were active in Calu-3 cells. This observation suggests that they are not
targeting the viral proteases. Consistent with this, Z-FA-FMK is an inhibitor of cathepsins which
are required for SARS-CoV-2 entry in cells where endosomal proteases are required for Spike
cleavage, and thus we observe no requirement in Calu-3 cells where TMPRSS2 is required for
infection (16, 19, 26-28).This has important implications in diverse SARS-CoV-2 studies where
there may be cell-type specific requirements for different steps in the replication cycle.
We also identified two inhibitors against the cellular histone methyltransferase G9a as antiviral
in Huh7.5 cells. However, these drugs were not active in Calu-3 cells, suggesting that there are
cell type specific requirements. AM1241 is a selective cannabinoid CB2 receptor agonist that we
found was antiviral in Huh7.5 cells. GW842166X, another CB2 agonist that has a 10-fold higher
EC50, was not active. Moreover, dose-response studied found that AM1241 is not active in
either Vero or Calu-3 cells.
Cepharanthine and tetrandrine are both bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids produced as natural
products from herbal plants (83). Tetrandrine, a traditional Chinese medicine and calcium
channel blocker, has been shown to antagonize calmodulin. It has anti-tumor and antiinflammatory effects, and can effectively inhibit fibroblasts, thereby inhibiting pulmonary fibrosis
(84, 85). Multiple studies have suggested that tetrandrine has antiviral activity, including against
dengue virus and herpes simplex 1 virus (86, 87). Tetrandrine has also been shown to inhibit
entry of Ebola virus into host cells in vitro and showed therapeutic efficacy against Ebola in
preliminary studies on mice (88). Currently, there is an ongoing clinical trial using tetrandrine in
COVID-19 patients to improve pulmonary function (80). Cepharanthine is reported to have antiinflammatory and immunoregulatory properties and is used to treat a variety of acute and
chronic conditions outside of the US (89). Both cepharanthine and tetrandrine were previously
shown to have antiviral activity against the human coronavirus OC43 and in recent studies on
SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cell screens (13, 62, 63). While both of these molecules were antiviral in
our Huh7.5 screen, neither were active in Calu-3 cells. This may suggest that they are
modulating endosomal entry pathways.
We identified few metabolic regulators. Dp44mT is a potent iron chelator that we found to be
antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 in Huh 7.5 and Calu-3 cells (56). A clinical trial with the iron
chelator deferoxamine is underway (NCT04333550). However, other iron chelators in our

library, deferasirox and deferiprone, were not identified as antiviral making the mechanism of
action unclear.
We identified several kinase inhibitors as antivirals against SARS-CoV-2. FRAX486 is a p21activated kinase (PAK) inhibitor that is antiviral in Huh7.5 cells, but only modestly impacted
infection of Calu-3 cells (90). Other PAK inhibitors were not identified in our screens. PAK is
required for entry by many viruses(91). PD0166285 is a potent Wee1 and Chk1 inhibitor that is
antiviral in Huh7.5 cells, but shows strong toxicity in Calu-3 cells (92).
We also found three mTOR inhibitors, AZD8055, PF-04691502, and WYE-125132 are antiviral
against SARS-CoV-2 in Huh-7 and Calu-3 cells. These are highly potent ATP competitive
mTOR inhibitors that target both TORC1 and TORC2. In our library, none of the rapamycin
analogs that selectively inhibit mTORC1 were active. We also identified two potent selective and
irreversible inhibitors of EGFR, dacomitinib and naquotinib. The other 44 EGFR inhibitors
showed no activity in Huh7.5 cells. Importantly, dacomitinib is a potent antiviral in Calu-3 cells. It
is unclear if the target is indeed EGFR, but for many viruses EGFR activation promotes viral
entry which may also be the case for SARS-CoV-2 (93-97).
Bemcentinib is a first-in-class Axl inhibitor that we found inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of
Huh7.5 cells and Calu-3 cells (98). Axl can be used as an attachment factor for the entry for
many viruses including Ebola and Zika virus (99, 100). While not published, news releases
suggest that Bemcentinib has demonstrated promise in preclinical data against early infection
with the SARS-CoV-2. A fast-tracked clinical trial is underway in the UK (101).
Cyclosporine is a commonly used immunosuppressant that binds Cyclophilin A and inhibits the
calcium-dependent phosphatase Calcineurin which is required for the nuclear translocation of
the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) (35-38, 41). Inhibition of this pathway in T cells is
used as an immunosuppressant. We found that Cyclosporine is active in both Huh7.5 and Calu3 cells, but has no activity in Vero cells nor did the cyclosporine analogs. A recent screen in
Vero cells did find activity with Cyclosporine against SARS-CoV-2 (13). Cyclophilin A is a
ubiquitously expressed peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (102). Cyclophilin A and other
Cyclophilins have chaperone-like activity and take part in protein-folding processes (103).
Cyclophilin A has been shown to be an important cellular factor that facilitated many diverse
viral infections. This includes human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), influenza virus,
hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), vaccinia virus
(VV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Rotavirus (RV) (41-49,
104, 105). The coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, FPIV, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV),
avian infectious bronchitis virus, and SARS-CoV have been found to be attenuated by
Cyclosporin A (40, 64, 106). Cyclosporine and its non-immunosuppressive derivatives can
inhibit replication of a number of viruses including some coronaviruses. In most cases the
responsible cyclophilin is CypA (54, 105), but CypA and CypB were found to be required for
FCoV replication (106). For HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E, cyclophilin A is required for infection
in CaCo-2 cells (50) and Huh-7.5 cells respectively (51, 52). It is generally thought that the
activity of Cyclosporine against coronaviruses is Cyclophilin-dependent and independent of
Calcineurin.
We found that a number of Cyclosporins were antiviral with similar potencies including
Cyclosporine, Cyclosporin A, Cyclosporin B and the metabolic breakdown product of
Cyclosporin A, Isoscyclosporin A. We also found that Cyclophilin A is likely required, as
Cyclosporin H, which is a weak binder had reduced activity. However, the enzymatic activity of
Cyclophilin A is likely dispensable as TMN355 was inactive. To further address the role of

Calcineurin, we tested a non-immunosuppressant derivative of cyclosporine that does not inhibit
calcineurin, has a similar activity to Cyclosporin C. We also found that FK506, a Calcineurin
inhibitor independent of Cyclophilin A, and NFAT inhibitors also have no antiviral activity.
Altogether, we found that cyclosporins are potent antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 in lung
epithelial cells, and that this activity is independent of calcineurins. NIM811 is a
Cyclophilin inhibitor independent of Calcineurin, and we found that this is highly active in Huh7.5
cells, further suggesting that Cyclophilin is required for SARS-CoVo-2 infection. Strikingly, the
activities of all of these drugs is similar in the two cell lines suggesting the same target and
mechanism-of-action and that Cyclosporine would block SARS-CoV-2 in diverse infected
tissues in vivo.
One approach would be to use Cyclophilin inhibitors that do not have immunosuppressive
activity such as NIM811 or others that have been tested for HCV infection (Alisporivir (Debio025) and SCY-635) (107) or for HIV infection (NIM818) (108) (54). Another possibility is to use
Cyclophilin inhibitors that also target Calcineurin (eg. Cyclosporine). One of the major
complications of COVID-19 is the hyper-inflammatory response and cytokine storm associated
with increased immune activation. To prevent hyper-activation, there has been interest in
treating COVID-19 patients with immunosuppressants (109). There are ongoing trials for a
variety of agents including anti-IL6 and JAK inhibitors, two clinical trials using sirolimus, the FDA
approved mTOR inhibitor, which selectively inhibits mTORC1. We find no antiviral activity of
sirolimus or other rapamycin derivatives. In contrast, Cyclosporin A is an approved
immunosuppressant that we found is also antiviral at concentrations achieved in vivo (110).
Therefore, it may be useful to implement clinical trials using Cyclosporin A as an
immunosuppressant as it would potentially ameliorate symptoms by two mechanisms (111).
There have been a large number of screens posted in the literature that suggest antiviral activity
of several existing drugs (e.g. azithromycin, Faviprivir, Lopinavir, ribavirin, and ritonavir,
tetracycline, etc). These drugs and most screens have been performed in Vero cells, with
toxicity as read-outs. Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) has compiled a list of drugs that has
support for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (https://www.mmv.org/mmv-open/covid-box).
We tested >60 of the 80 compounds and find that in addition to the quinolines and drugs found
in our screen there are few additional compounds that show activity at less than 2 uM. While it
is possible that some of these drugs are false negatives in our screens, it is likely that many of
these candidates do not have antiviral activity when either measuring viral antigen production or
when looking in different cell types. It is very important that identified antivirals be tested for their
impact on viral replication more directly. Moreover, given the striking differences in sensitivities
across cell types it is important to validate the activity of any new antivirals in lung epithelial
cells.
Altogether, these studies highlight the roles of cellular genes in viral infection, cell type
differences, and our discovery of nine broadly active antivirals suggest new avenues for
therapeutic interventions. We found that of the 9 drugs are antiviral in lung epithelial cells, 7
have been used in humans, 3 of these are FDA approved in the US (Cyclosporine, Dacomitinib,
and Salinomycin), and Ebastine is approved outside of the US. While clinical trials are underway
with some of these candidates, additional trials will be needed to determine the efficacy of these
antivirals in COVID-19 patients, to inform future treatment strategies.

Vero E6 cells and Vero CCL81 were obtained from ATCC and were cultured in DMEM,
supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin, 1% (v/v) LGlutamax and were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2. Huh7.5 cells were obtained from C. Rice
(Rockefeller) and cultured in DMEM, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v)
penicillin/streptomycin, 1% (v/v) L-glutamine, and were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2. Calu-3
cells (HTB-55) were obtained from ATCC and cultured in MEM, supplemented with 10% (v/v)
fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin, 1% (v/v) L-glutamine, and were maintained
at 37°C and 5% CO2. SARS-CoV-2 was obtained from BEI (WA-1 strain). Stocks were
prepared by infection of Vero E6 cells in 2% serum plus 10mM HEPES for five days, freezethawed, and clarified by centrifugation (PO). Titer of stock was determined by plaque assay
using Vero E6 cells and were 1x107 pfu/mL and 1.5x106 TCID50/mL (6). This seed stock was
amplified in Vero CCL81 (P1) at 1.5x106 TCID50/mL. All work with infectious virus was
performed in a Biosafety Level 3 laboratory and approved by the Institutional Biosafety
Committee and Environmental Health and Safety.
Infections:
Cells were plated in 384 well plates (20µL/well) 3,000 cells per well for Vero, 3,000 cells per well
Huh7.5, 7,500 cells per well Calu-3. The next day, 50nL of drugs were added. The positive
control remdesivir and the negative control DMSO were spotted on each plate. One hour later
cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Vero, MOI=1; Huh7.5 MOI=1; Calu-3 MOI=0.5) Cells
were fixed (30hpi Vero and Huh7,5, 48hpi Calu-3) in 4% formaldehyde/PBS for 15min at room
temperature and then washed three times with PBST. Cells were blocked (2% BSA/PBST) for
60 minutes and incubated in primary antibody (anti-dsRNA J2) overnight at 4C. Cells were
washed 3x in PBST and incubated in secondary (anti-mouse alexa 488 and hoescht 33342) for
1h at room temperature. Cells were washed 3x in PBST and imaged using ImagXpress Micro
using a 10X objective. Four sites per well were captured. The total number of cells and the
number of infected cells were measured using MetaXpress 5.3.3 cell scoring module, and the
percentage of infected cells was calculated. The aggregated infection of the DMSO and
remdesivir control wells (n=16) on each assay plate were used to calculate z’-factors, as a
measure of assay performance and data quality. Sample well infection was normalized to
aggregated DMSO plate control wells and expressed as Percentage of Control [POC =
(%Infectionsample/ Average %InfectionDMSO)*100] and Z-score [Z= (%Infectionsample - Average
%InfectionDMSO) / Standard Deviation %InfectionDMSO]in Spotfire (PerkinElmer). Candidate hits
were selected as compounds with POC<40% and viability >80%, compared to vehicle control.
Candidate drugs were repurchased as powders from Selleckchem, MedchemExpress, and
MedKoo and suspended in DMSO. Drugs were arrayed in 8-pt dose-response in 384 well
plates. Infections were performed using screening conditions. DMSO (n=32) and 10 µM
remdesivir (n=16) were included on each validation plate as controls for normalization. Infection
at each drug concentration was normalized to aggregated DMSO plate control wells and
expressed as percentage-of-control (POC=% Infection sample/Avg % Infection DMSO cont). ). A nonlinear regression curve fit analysis (GraphPad Prism 8) was performed on POC Infection and
cell viability using log10 transformed concentration values to calculate IC50 values for Infection
and CC50 values for cell viability for each drug/cell line combination. Selectivity index (SI) was
calculated as a ratio of drug’s CC50 and IC50 values (SI = CC50/IC50).
RT-qPCR:
Huh7.5 (750,000 cells/well) or Calu-3 cells (750,000 cells/well) were plated in 6 well plates. The
next day, drugs were added and one hour later infected with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI=0.5). Total
RNA was purified using Trizol (Invitrogen) followed by RNA Clean and Concentrate kit (Zymo
Researc) 24 hpi for Huh7.5 or 48 hpi for Calu-3. For cDNA synthesis, reverse transcription was

performed with random hexamers and Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MLV) reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen). Synthesized RNA was used as a standard (BEI). Gene specific
primers to SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan v1, NSP14) and SYBR green master mix (Applied Biosystems)
were used to amplify viral RNA and 18S rRNA primers were used to amplify cellular RNA using
the QuantStudio 6 Flex RT-PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Relative quantities of viral and
cellular RNA were calculated using the standard curve method (112). Viral RNA was
normalized to 18S RNA for each sample (Wuhan V1/18S).
