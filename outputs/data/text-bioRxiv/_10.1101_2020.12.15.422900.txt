ABSTRACT (197 words)
We examined the extent to which the scientific workforce in different fields was engaged
in publishing COVID-19-related papers. According to Scopus (data cut, March 1, 2021),
129,570 COVID-19-related publications included 495,010 unique authors, of which
211,894 authors had published at least 5 full papers in their career and 15,012 authors were
at the top 2% of their scientific subfield based on a career-long composite citation
indicator. The growth of COVID-19 authors was far more rapid and massive compared
with cohorts of authors historically publishing on H1N1, Zika, Ebola, HIV/AIDS and
tuberculosis. All 174 scientific subfields had some specialists who had published on
COVID-19. In 98 of the 174 subfields of science, at least one in ten active, influential (top2% composite citation indicator) authors in the subfield had authored something on
COVID-19. 67 hyper-prolific authors had already at least 40 (and up to 160) COVID-19
publications each. Among the 300 authors with the highest composite citation indicator for
their COVID-19 publications, most common countries were USA (n=75), China (n=60),
UK (n=30), and Italy (n=20). The rapid and massive involvement of the scientific
workforce in COVID-19-related work is unprecedented and creates opportunities and
challenges. There is evidence for hyper-prolific productivity.

The acute crisis of COVID-19 has challenged the scientific community to generate
timely evidence about the new coronavirus and its pandemic. Interest on COVID-19 has
spread rapidly and widely across the scientific literature and among researchers. Such an
“all hands on deck” response of the scientific workforce during a crisis may have been
beneficial in generating ideas and evidence expeditiously. However, many authors
publishing on COVID-19 may have lacked proper background expertise. The explosive
focus on COVID-19 may have caused some inappropriate “covidization” of research2,3 and
the resulting research, conducted in such haste, may suffer from low validity.,4,5
Here, we aim to understand which scientific areas and which types of scientists
have been most mobilized by the pandemic. The growth of the COVID-19 author cohort is
contrasted against what happened in the mobilization of the scientific workforce for 5
other major infectious diseases. We also probe whether there is evidence of hyper-prolific
productivity with some scientists rapidly publishing large numbers of papers.
Concurrently, we evaluate scientists who have had the highest citation impact for their
COVID-19-related work. Finally, we discuss the implications of this rapid “covidization”
of the research enterprise.
METHODS
We used a copy of the Scopus database6 extracted on March 1, 2021. COVID-19
publications have been specified as those returned by the query: TITLE-ABS-KEY(sarscov-2 OR "coronavirus 2" OR "corona virus 2" OR covid-19 OR {novel coronavirus} OR
{novel corona virus} OR 2019-ncov OR covid OR covid19 OR ncovid-19 OR
"coronavirus disease 2019" OR "corona virus disease 2019" OR corona-19 OR SARSnCoV OR ncov-2019) AND PUBYEAR > 2018. We further filtered the dataset using the

Elsevier International Center for the Study of Research (ICSR) Lab infrastructure to
publications indexed (loaded) in Scopus in 2020 or 2021 only, and with a publication year
of 2020 or greater. In order to evaluate publication dates by month, we have used the
publication month and year where available. When publication month was either not
available or exceeded the indexing date, we used the indexing date. This accounts, for
example, for cases where an article is published today, but the official journal issue is due
later. Our evaluation is targeted at the date at which publications became available to the
public rather than official publication dates.
We considered both publications in peer-reviewed venues and preprints. To avoid
double counting of the same item (e.g., a work published both in a peer-reviewed journal
and as a preprint, or in two preprint servers), we identified and filtered out duplicates by
matching against author names and titles. Our search-based approach applies methods used
for unstructured reference linking7 and ranks documents based on similarity of fields. We
used a combination of author names and titles, as many commonly used fields in reference
linking, such as journal title, do not apply. The process first identifies multiple potential
duplicate matches based on these fields, and then validates the best match based on the
overlap between words in the title and author names. After identifying top candidate
matches for de-duplication, the process applies a validation step based on the overlap
between words in the title and author names. We excluded all preprints that link to either a
non-preprint item, such as journal articles, or another preprint with an earlier date. The
result of this step is exclusion of 4,566 preprints.
We further focused on the 2,989,810 authors who have at least one Scopus-indexed
publication since 2020 and who have also authored in their entire career at least 5 Scopus-

indexed papers classified as articles, reviews or conference papers. This allows exclusion
of authors with limited recent presence in the scientific literature as well as some author
IDs that may represent split fragments of the publication record of some more prolific
authors.
Field classification
All authors were assigned to their most common field and subfield discipline of
their career. We used the Science Metrix classification of science, which is a standard
mapping of all science into 21 main fields and 174 subfield disciplines.8,9
Influential scientists
We also examined how COVID-19 has affected the publication portfolio of
researchers whose work has the largest citation impact in the literature. On the one hand,
these scientists are already well established and thus may have less need or interest to
venture into a new field. On the other hand, these scientists are also more productive and
competitive, therefore they may be faster in moving into a rapidly emerging, new
important frontier. We used the career-long statistics calculated with the Scopus database
of November 1, 2020, using the code as provided with the supplemental data recently
published for the most cited authors across science.10-12 Each author has been assigned to a
main field and main subfield based on the largest proportion of publications across fields
and analysis is restricted to the top 2% authors per Science Metrix subfield. We have
developed a composite citation indicator10,11 and accordingly 141,082 scientists can be
classified as being in the top 2% of their main subfield discipline based on the citations
that their work received through 2019. Of those, 101,509 were active and had published at
least 1 paper also in 2020 or early 2021.

Topics of prominence
In order to visualize the growth and spread of the COVID-19 scientific literature
across scientific fields and over time, we used a graphical mapping of scientific fields that
has been previously developed13 and which places the 333 Scopus journal categories
sequentially around the perimeter of a circle. There are 27 high-level categories that are
placed first and ordered in a manner that emerges naturally from a meta-analysis of the
layouts of other science maps created using multiple databases and methods.14 Each of the
27 categories is assigned a unique color. The remaining 306 lower-level journal categories
are then ordered within the corresponding high-level categories using factor analyses based
on citation patterns. Each of the 333 journal categories thus has a fixed position on the
perimeter of the circle.
The full Scopus citation graph of well over 50 million articles and 1 billion citation
links was used to cluster articles into over 90,000 topics using established methods.15 Each
topic is assigned a position within the circle based on triangulation of the positions of its
constituent papers, each of which takes on the positional characteristics of its journal
category. Topics are colored by their dominant journal category and area-sized
proportionally based on the number of objects (e.g., papers, authors) being counted for the
particular analysis. This circle of science and topic visualization are used in Elsevier’s
SciVal tool. For the display of authors per topic, we have assigned authors to one topic by
taking the topic with the highest proportion of publications per author.
Comparison against other infectious diseases
We performed Scopus searches for terms reflecting 4 other infectious diseases that
have manifested as epidemics in modern history (H1N1, AIDS, Ebola, Zika) and

tuberculosis, an epidemic that is ongoing since ancient times and that has probably resulted
in the largest cumulative number of deaths over history compared with any other infectious
pathogen. We used the search terms TITLE-ABS-KEY("swine flu" OR *h1n1*), TITLEABS-KEY(*ebola*), TITLE-ABS-KEY(*zika*), and TITLE-ABS(*tuberculosis*). AIDS
requires a more thorough search strategy as keywords and title searches will yield many
false positives for the target disease. We collected papers based on the Fingerprint engine
concepts29 "Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1", "HIV Infection", "AIDS/HIV", "HIV-1",
"HIV Prevention", "HIV Testing", "Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 Reverse
Transcriptase". These concepts are based on a unified controlled thesaurus which among
other things, addresses the disambiguation of homonyms such as “hearing aids.”
Prolific authors and authors with high citation impact of their COVID-19 publication
record
We also mapped the most prolific authors of the published COVID-19 corpus and
the authors whose COVID-19 publications to-date had the highest citation impact.
For prolific productivity, we ranked the authors according to decreasing number of
COVID-19 published items. We show detailed data on extremely prolific authors with
over 30 COVID-19 published items to-date.
Citation impact was assessed with the previously proposed citation indicator10-12
that combines information on 6 indices: total citations, Hirsch h-index, Schreiber hmindex, citations to single-authored papers, citations to first- or single-authored papers, and
citations to first-, single- or last-authored papers. This avoids focusing simply on a single
traditional metric such as citations, where it is expected that the authors of the earliest
highly-cited papers would monopolize the top of the list, even if they had published a

single paper and they were co-authors among many other authors. Self-citations are
excluded from all calculations.11,12 We present descriptive data on the institution, country
and two most common scientific subfields (per Science Metrix classification) for the top300 authors in that list.
We avoid comparisons based on statistical tests, as the analyses presented here are
descriptive and exploratory.
RESULTS
COVID-19 papers and authors
As of March 1, 2020, Scopus classified 129,570 papers as relevant to COVID-19,
which accounts for 3.3% of the 3,963,553 papers across all science published and
indexed in Scopus in the period January 1, 2020 until March 1, 2021. The 129,570
published items were classified by Scopus as articles (67,124, 52%), letters (17,296, 13%),
reviews (13,300, 10%), preprints from ArXiv, BioRxiv, ChemRxiv, and medRxiv that
could not be matched to other publications (10,375, 8%), notes (8,599, 7%), editorials
(7,441, 6%), conference papers (2,865, 2%), and other items (2,571, 2%).
The overall share of COVID-19 papers has steadily increased over time and has
exceeded 3.3% among papers published in February 2021. The 129,570 COVID-19 papers
include 495,010 unique authors (with different Scopus IDs), amounting to 6% of the
8,310,451 author IDs who have published at least 1 paper of any type and on any topic in
2020 or early 2021. The most common countries of these 495,010 authors were USA
(n=82,858), China (n=44,472), Italy (n=30,157), UK (n=28,696), India (n=17,926) and
Spain (n=17,282) accounting for a total of 221,391 authors (45%). China had more authors
involved in COVID-19 papers until May, after which the USA surpassed China.

Among the 2,989,810 authors who have published anything that is Scopus-indexed
in 2020 or early 2021 and who have also authored in their entire career at least 5 Scopusindexed papers that are classified as articles, reviews or conference papers, by the end of
February 2021, 211,894 of these authors (7.1%), had at least one published and indexed
COVID-19 paper.
Scientific fields and subfields
Among the 2,989,810 authors, researchers from Public Health and Clinical
Medicine (based on their career-long Science Metrix main field) published on COVID-19
at the highest rate: 15.5% (9,478/60,984) of Public Health authors and 14%
(126,519/902,653) of Clinical Medicine authors published COVID-19 research by the end
of February 2021. However, publishing COVID-19 research were seen across all 21 major
fields. The lowest percentage was seen in the field of Physics & Astronomy (1.2%), from
which even 3,225 authors had COVID-19 publications. At the subfield discipline level, the
highest COVID-19 publication rate of authors was seen (Table 1) in Emergency and
Critical Care Medicine (31.8%). However, such rates were higher than 10% (i.e., at least
one in ten authors in that field had published on COVID-19) in 43 subfield disciplines and
higher than 5% (i.e., at least one in twenty authors) in 89 subfield disciplines. All 174
subfields had one or more authors publishing on COVID-19. Supplementary Table 1 gives
detailed data for COVID-19 publication rates of authors across all subfield disciplines.
29% of the authors published their COVID-19 research primarily in a subfield
discipline that was not among the top 3 subfield disciplines where they had published most
commonly during their career. Sometimes the fields of expertise of authors seemed remote
from COVID-19, e.g., an expert on solar cells publishing on COVID-19 in healthcare

personnel. Even experts specializing in their past work on remote disciplines such as
fisheries, ornithology, entomology or architecture had published on COVID-19.
Influential scientists and COVID-19 publications
Influential scientists were even more likely to have published COVID-19 research
(Supplementary Table 2). Among the 101,509 influential scientists active in publishing in
2020 or early 2021, 15,012 (14.7%) had COVID-19 publications in 2020 or early 2021.
The publication rate was the highest in the fields of Public Health (30.3%) and Clinical
Medicine (28.4%). Among subfield disciplines, the highest publication rate of such active,
influential authors was seen (Table 2) in Allergy (57.5%), Emergency & Critical Care
Medicine (55.4%) and Applied Ethics (54.5%). However, publication rates were higher
than 10% (i.e.. at least one in ten authors in that field had authored something on COVID19) in 98 of 174 subfield disciplines across science and higher than 5% (i.e., at least one in
twenty authors) in 122 subfield disciplines.
Topics of prominence
Figure 1 shows the growth and spread of COVID-19 papers, authors of COVID-19
papers, and high-impact authors of COVID-19 papers (those who belong to the top-2% of
impact, as discussed previously) across scientific topics. As shown, there is a strong
response of the literature and of the scientific workforce in some specific thematic areas,
but there is also increasing and substantial involvement of scientists and respective
publications, even in remote topics.
Comparison with other infectious diseases
As shown in Figure 2, the massive growth of authors publishing on COVID-19 has
been far more rapid and prominent than the growth of the publishing scientific workforce

retrieved with the searches for terms reflecting 5 other infectious diseases. None of the
other 5 infectious diseases managed to attract more than one-tenth the number of new
authors in a single year (maximum: HIV/AIDS, 16,817 new authors publishing in 2016
who had not published HIV/AIDS items before) compared with the number of authors
recruited by COVID-19 (189,680 authors in 2020) (Figure 2A). Moreover, none of the
other 5 infectious diseases reached such a large number of active authors publishing in any
single year (maxima of 52,618 active authors on HIV/AIDS in 2016, 27,502 active authors
on tuberculosis in 2016, 13,772 active authors on H1N1 in 2011, 9,746 active authors on
Zika in 2017, 6,608 active authors on Ebola in 2016).
Productivity for COVID-19 publications
A total of 3,733 author IDs in Scopus had 10 or more Scopus-indexed published
COVID items. Setting thresholds of at least 15, 20, 25, 30 and 40 items, the numbers of
such extremely prolific authors were 1,299, 556, 306, 163 and 67, respectively. Figure 3
shows the distribution of COVID publication frequency of authors and Table 2 the 67
authors with 40 or more COVID-19 published items indexed in Scopus. Of these 67
extremely prolific authors, 6 were BMJ news journalists, one was the Lancet editor-inchief and another was the anonymous Lancet editor’s column, and one was an audio
interview editor at the New England Journal of Medicine. Among the remaining 58
scientists, the most common countries were USA (n=10), Italy (n=10), Hong Kong (n=6),
UK (n=5), China (n=4) and India (n=4).

19-related publications. Among the 300 authors with the highest composite citation
indicator scores, 27 were journalists or editors publishing news stories or editorials in their
high-impact general medical or science journals. Most common countries for the
remaining authors were USA (n=75), China (n=60), UK (n=30), Italy (n=20), India (n=12)
and Germany (n=11). Of the 273 scientists, Microbiology was one of their top 2 publishing
Science Metrix subfields for 94 (34.4%), followed by General & Internal Medicine (n=58,
21.2%) and Virology (n=58, 21.2%), and Immunology (n=32, 11.7%).
DISCUSSION
Half a million scientists (and counting) have published work related to COVID-19.
The most influential scientists across science were even more commonly engaged with
COVID-19 research. Almost one in six active, influential scientists quickly added or
adjusted their publishing portfolio to include COVID-19. More than half of the active,
influential scientists in several scientific subfields were involved urgently in COVID-19
work, and every single scientific subfield had some scientists publishing on COVID-19.
The rapid and extensive spread of COVID-19 interests across the map of science
was unique compared with other major epidemic infectious diseases. A comparison against
5 other major epidemic infectious diseases showed that none of them came anywhere close
to the explosive nature of the involvement of the scientific workforce in COVID-19related work. This applied even to HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis that have had a far greater
cumulative mortality toll. HIV/AIDS has killed over 35 million people and tuberculosis
has killed over 1 billion people to-date.16,17
Our data even underestimate the explosive growth of COVID-19-related work,
since some papers are published but not yet indexed. Some of this deficit is captured by

preprints (a popular method of disseminating information in the COVID-19 era),18-20 but
the COVID-19 literature is substantially larger than what is indexed in Scopus. The
COVID-19 Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease database maintained by the World
Health Organization included 221,281 published items as of March 5, 2021 (including
18,307 preprints) (https://search.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019ncov/). It is possible that authors publishing on COVID-19 may be approaching (or have
exceeded) a million as of this writing.
Many authors had published an astonishingly large number of COVID-19 items,
and 67 had published 40 or more in such short time. Given delays in indexing, these
numbers may underestimate the hyper-prolific productivity. The concentration of hyperprolific authors in countries like China, Hong Kong, and Italy may be related to the early
outbreak of the pandemic in these locations, as well as prevalent co-authorship practices in
these countries. Importantly, meritorious productivity versus sloppiness is difficult to
disentangle without examining each case in depth.
We also addressed the citation impact of authors for their COVID-19 work. The
top ranks included many journalists and editors who published numerous news stories and
editorials in their highly visible medical and science journals. This news/editorial function
may be helpful. These published items may be readily used for citations, as they are often
published well in advance of the scientific work to which they refer. However, the quality,
standards and validity of rapidly deployed non-peer-reviewed items is unknown. Flashy
news, media, and editorializing in both academic journals and the popular press may be
prominent during the pandemic.21-24 It is unknown whether non-peer-reviewed news
stories and in-house editorials in major journals help safeguard against the “infodemic” or

sometimes contribute to make things worse. Excluding journalists and editors of
prestigious journals, the key countries of the authors with the highest composite citation
indicator tended to be similar to the countries of the most prolific authors. A few subfields
accounted for the lion’s share of the authors with the highest composite citation indicator.
The rapid response of the scientific community to crisis is largely a welcome
phenomenon. Many scientists quickly focused their attention to an urgent situation and an
entirely new pathogen and disease. This demonstrates that the scientific community has
sufficient flexibility to shift attention rapidly to major issues. Much was swiftly learned on
COVID-19. However, the quality of the published work was not assessed in our analysis,
and several evaluations raise concerns about many of the COVID-19 publications being of
low quality.25-27 Massive productivity has been described in the pre-COVID era, as
affecting researchers across many fields28 and may be a particular feature for COVID-19
research. Extreme productivity would be worrisome if it sacrifices quality.
The spread of COVID-19 publications in topics and authors traditionally working
beyond key relevant disciplines further testifies the great attractiveness of COVID-19 as a
field of investigation. The favorable aspect of this expansion is the ability to bring in
specialists with expertise in diverse fields, fostering interdisciplinarity. However, if many
scientists have ventured to work and publish in areas where they lack fundamental
expertise, their contributions may be problematic or outright erroneous.
Furthermore, there has been a rapid mobilization of funding into COVID-19
research, with some areas, e.g., vaccine development, earmarked for urgent work. This
may have worked as an additional attractor of scientists to this rapidly expanding field.

produced publication record may not be very informative and some may be fundamentally
flawed. Flaws go beyond retractions, which account for <0.1% of published COVID-19
work.30,31
Certain limitations should be discussed. First, current Scopus data have high
precision and recall (98.1% and 94.4%, respectively),6 but some authors may be split in
two or more records and some ID records may include papers from two or more authors.
These errors may affect single authors but are unlikely to affect the overall picture
obtained in these analyses. Second, field and subfield classification follows a well-known
established method, though published items are not precisely categorizable in scientific
fields. Third, data on citation impact of COVID-19 authors are too early to appraise with
confidence, and the ranking of specific scientists is highly tenuous and can quickly change
with relatively small changes in citation counts. The bigger picture of author
characteristics rather than specific names should be the focus of these data. Fourth, since
many COVID-19 accepted papers are not yet indexed in Scopus, fields with slower
publication and indexing may be relatively under-represented in the analyses. Fifth, we
used simple terms that are highly specific for the comparative evaluation of other
infectious diseases and some relevant papers and authors working on them may have been
missed. However, the difference of these other diseases against the explosive nature of
COVID-19 authorships is so stark that it would still be very prominent even if some
additional authors working on these diseases could be identified.
As the pandemic matures, the science of COVID-19 should also mature. Important
remaining questions can be raised about the extent and duration of this “covidization” of
research.2,3 Will scientists continue to flock from different disciplines into COVID-19

research? What consequences might this have for other areas of important investigation,
and could non-COVID-19 topics be unfairly neglected? Is the response proportional to the
magnitude of the crisis? What is the validity and utility of all these publications? Tracking
both the pandemic and the scientific response to the pandemic will be useful to make
decisions about planning for the growth, reallocation of interest, and old-versus-new
priorities for science and publishing scientists.

Figure 1 Topics of prominence for COVID-19 authors and publications. The columns
represent the progress of the spread at 3 different measuring points: by end of February
2020, end of June 2020, end of October 2020 and end of February 2021. The first row
represents the spread of authors of COVID-19 papers. The authors are assigned to their
most dominant topic in their career. The data is filtered to include only topics with >=5
authors assigned. The second row shows similarly the topics of the top 2% authors by field
according to a composite citations indicator. Only topics with 2 or more authors are
displayed. The third row displays the spread of COVID-19 publications across topics. The
minimum threshold for a topic to be displayed is set to 5 COVID-19 publications. Of note,
the author panels show more dispersed distributions than the publication topic panels,
suggesting that several authors are moving out of their main career topics to publish on
COVID-19.
