Abstract

25

Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) is an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) that shows

26

broad antiviral activities against a wide range of enveloped viruses. Here, using an ISG

27

screen against VSV-SARS-CoV and VSV-SARS-CoV-2 chimeric viruses, we identified

28

CH25H and its enzymatic product 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) as potent inhibitors of

29

virus replication. Mechanistically, internalized 25HC accumulates in the late endosomes

30

and blocks cholesterol export, thereby restricting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein catalyzed

31

membrane fusion. Our results highlight a unique antiviral mechanism of 25HC and

32

provide the molecular basis for its possible therapeutic development.

Main Text

35

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the

36

etiological agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19)1, 2, has infected millions of

37

people worldwide and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, with a case fatality rate

38

as high as 5%3. Currently, there are no FDA approved vaccines available. In most

39

instances, treatment is limited to supportive therapies to help alleviate symptoms.

40

Chloroquine phosphate, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and a polymerase inhibitor

41

remdesivir represent the only drug products that the FDA has approved for emergency

42

use authorization4, and concern exists that monotherapy would rapidly result in the

43

emergence of resistance. There is a pressing need to identify effective antivirals as

44

countermeasures before safe and efficacious vaccines are developed and deployed.

45

Here, we sought to harness the host innate immune responses to inhibit SARS-CoV-2

46

replication. Interferons (IFNs) are a group of small, secreted proteins5,

that potently

47

suppress the replication of many viruses through the action of hundreds of IFN-stimulated

48

genes (ISGs)7. IFN and ISG levels are upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and

49

lung tissues from COVID-19 patients8, 9. Compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 appears

50

to be more sensitive to the antiviral activities of IFNs10. SARS-CoV-2 replication is

51

inhibited by IFN treatment in both immortalized and primary cells11, 12, 13. While direct IFN

52

administration often results in adverse effects in humans14, 15, a targeted approach of

53

activating the antiviral effects of specific ISGs holds promise.

54
55

To identify potential anti-coronavirus (CoV) ISG effector proteins that act at the entry or

56

egress stages of the virus replication cycle, we utilized replication-competent chimeric

57

vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) eGFP reporter viruses decorated with either full length

58

SARS-CoV spike (S) protein or SARS-CoV-2 S in place of the native glycoprotein (G)16.

59

We also constructed a HEK293 cell line that stably expresses plasma membrane-

60

localized mCherry-tagged human ACE2, the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 receptor2, 17,

61

18, 19

62

replication than wild-type HEK293 cells (Fig. S1B-D). We recently showed robust SARS-

63

CoV-2 infection of primary human intestinal enteroids29. By RNA-sequencing of these

64

intestinal enteroid cultures, we identified the ISGs most highly and commonly induced by

65

type I IFN (IFN-β) and type III IFN (IFN-λ). We transduced HEK293-hACE2 stable cells

66

with lentiviruses encoding 57 of these individual ISGs and tested their ability to suppress

67

VSV-SARS-CoV and VSV-SARS-CoV-2 replication.

69

Ectopic expression of AXIN2, CH25H, EPSTI1, GBP5, IFIH1, IFITM2, IFITM3, and LY6E

70

resulted in a marked reduction (< 36%) in the infectivity of both viruses, indicated by the

71

number of GFP infected cells (Fig. 1A, Dataset S1). Among these genes, IFIH1 (also

72

known as MDA5) activates IFN signaling upon ectopic expression20. LY6E and IFITMs

73

recently were reported to inhibit SARS-CoV-221, 22 and thus served as positive controls

74

for our assay. We validated the top candidates in HEK293-hACE2 cells expressing

75

CH25H, IFITM1, IFITM2, or IFITM3 respectively (Fig. S1E). Consistent with our screen

76

results, the expression of IFITM2 or IFITM3 but not IFITM1 suppressed VSV-SARS-CoV-

77

2 infection as evident by a reduction in viral mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1B and S1F).

78

CH25H was comparable to IFITM2 and blocked virus replication at 18 hours post infection

79

(hpi) (Fig. 1B).

80
81

CH25H encodes a cholesterol 25-hydroxylase23 that catalyzes the formation of 25-

82

hydroxycholesterol (25HC) from cholesterol23. In macrophages, 25HC is further

83

converted to 7-α, 25-dihydroxycholesterol (7-α, 25-OHC), an oxysterol that functions as

84

a chemoattractant for T cells and B cells24. 25HC exhibits broad inhibitory activities

85

against enveloped viruses of different families25, 26, including two porcine CoVs27. Within

86

a single-cycle of replication (6 hpi), CH25H expression inhibited the replication of VSV-

87

SARS-CoV and VSV-SARS-CoV-2 viruses, as detected by measurement of eGFP

88

expression using flow cytometry (Fig. 1C). CH25H also weakly decreased wild-type VSV

89

replication (Fig. 1C), as previously reported28. In contrast, rotavirus and adenovirus

90

replication were not affected (Fig. 1D). Unlike IFIH1, CH25H expression or 25HC

91

treatment did not induce type I or type III IFN expression (Fig. S1G). The replication of a

92

clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 also was suppressed in HEK293-hACE2 cells expressing

93

CH25H compared to control plasmid transfection (Fig. 1E).

94
95

Next, we tested whether the antiviral activity of CH25H depends on 25HC synthesis. As

96

compared to the control 7-α, 25-OHC, pre-treatment of HEK293-hACE2 cells with 25HC

97

for 1 hour prior to VSV-SARS-CoV-2 infection recapitulated the suppressive effect of

98

CH25H overexpression and reduced virus replication (Fig. 2A). 25HC dose-dependently

99

inhibited VSV-SARS-CoV-2 infection in MA104 cells, with an approximate EC50 of 1.03

100

µM (Fig. 2B). No cytotoxicity was observed at the highest concentration tested (30 µM).

101

When plaque assays were performed in the presence of 25HC, there was a reduction in

102

both plaque numbers and sizes (Fig. S2A-B). Wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus replication

103

also was inhibited by 25HC but not 7-α, 25-OHC treatment (Fig. 2C). Collectively, our

104

results suggest an antiviral activity of CH25H and its natural product 25HC in suppressing

105

SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.

106
107

During SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, S protein binding to ACE2 enables its cleavage

and intestinal epithelial cells30, 33. Thus, we examined whether the presence of TMPRSS2

113

assists VSV-SARS-CoV-2 to overcome ISG restriction. TMPRSS2 expression enhanced

115

HEK293-hACE2 cells (Fig. 1C). Unlike IFITM3, CH25H partially retained its antiviral

116

activity and led to reduced VSV-SARS-CoV-2 replication in TMPRSS2-expressing cells

117

(Fig. 3A). Similarly, wild-type SARS-CoV-2 replication was inhibited by CH25H and 25HC

118

in TMPRSS2 expressing cells (Fig. 3B).

119
120

We next examined the effect of 25HC on SARS-CoV S and SARS-CoV-2 S mediated

121

membrane fusion, since 25HC blocks cell fusion by Nipah F and VSV G proteins28, which

122

are class I and class III viral fusion proteins respectively34. We set up an in vitro cell-to-

123

cell fusion assay based on the expression of S, GFP, ACE2, and TMPRSS2 in HEK293

124

cells, independently of virus infection (Fig. 3C). CH25H expression substantially reduced

125

syncytia formation mediated by SARS-CoV-2 S (Fig. 3C). Although IFITM2 and IFITM3

126

inhibited VSV-SARS-CoV-2 replication (Fig. 1A-B), neither prevented S-mediated fusion

127

(Fig. 3C), suggesting a distinct mode of antiviral action. Compared to SARS-CoV-2 S,

128

SARS-CoV S induced weaker cell fusion as recently reported35, and this process was

129

also blocked by CH25H expression (Fig. 3C). CH25H also inhibited the syncytia formation

130

induced by Western equine encephalitis virus glycoproteins (class II) and VSV-G (class

131

III) but not reovirus FAST p10 (class IV) fusion protein36 (Fig. 3D). To mimic the virus-cell

132

membrane fusion, we co-transfected SARS-CoV-2 S and GFP into donor cells and mixed

133

at 1:1 ratio with ACE2+TMPRSS2+TdTomato co-transfected target cells. As expected,

134

we observed robust syncytia formation under mock conditions (Fig. S3B). CH25H

135

expression in ‘recipient’ cells almost completely abolished cell-cell fusion (Fig. S3B).

136

Exogenous 25HC treatment phenocopied CH25H expression and blocked SARS-CoV-2

137

S mediated syncytia formation (Fig. S3B and 3E). Similar to CH25H, 25HC failed to inhibit

138

reovirus FAST p10 mediated fusion (Fig. S3C).

139
140

To define the underlying antiviral mechanisms of the IFN-CH25H-25HC axis further, we

141

investigated whether 25HC acts on viral or host membranes. Pre-incubation of VSV-

142

SARS-CoV-2 with 10 µM of 25HC for 20 minutes had no effect on infectivity, as opposed

143

to the pre-treatment of host cells (Fig. S4A). The timing of 25HC addition suggests it

144

primarily acted at the entry stage of VSV-SARS-CoV-2 replication (Fig. S4B). We

145

examined a series of early events and excluded possible effects of 25HC on: (i) ACE2

146

surface levels; (ii) S cleavage by TMPRSS2; (iii) lipid raft localization, stained by a

147

fluorophore-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B, (iv) plasma membrane fluidity, stained by

160

endosomes and LAMP1 positive lysosomes but not Rab4 positive early and recycling

161

endosomes (Fig. 4B). Thus, we hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 depends on endosomal

162

trafficking to establish active replication. Consistent with this hypothesis, ectopic

163

expression of Rab5 and Rab7 dominant negative mutants but not the wild-type proteins

164

significantly decreased VSV-SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 4C and S4F). However, Rab5

165

and Rab7 mutants did not have an additive effect with 25HC treatment (Fig. 4C), further

166

suggesting that 25HC may act at these endosomal vesicles. 25HC is capable of binding

167

Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) in vitro39, responsible for the egress of cholesterol from the

168

endosomal/lysosomal compartment40. 25HC treatment led to an accumulation of

169

intracellular TopFluor-cholesterol (Fig. 4D). 25HC failed to inhibit the replication of VSV-

170

SARS-CoV-2 in serum-free media, in which the infectivity was markedly enhanced (Fig.

171

4E). Itraconazole (ICZ), a small-molecule inhibitor of NPC1 that elevates endosomal

172

cholesterol levels41, mirrored 25HC and inhibited VSV-SARS-CoV-2 replication, more

173

potently than the furin inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-CMK (Fig. 4F). The antiviral activity of

174

ICZ also depended on cholesterol and restricted VSV-SARS-CoV-2 in a cell-type

175

independent manner (Fig. 4F-G). In contrast to chloroquine and camostat, both of which

176

are antiviral but through different mechanisms, cholesterol-depleting agent methyl-β-

177

cyclodextrin42 reduced SARS-CoV-2 S mediated cell-cell fusion (Fig. 4H). Either ICZ or

178

25HC also efficiently reduced syncytia formation (Fig. 4H). Finally, ICZ suppressed the

179

replication of a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 virus that encodes a mNeon-Green reporter43

180

in Vero-E6 cells (Fig. 4I). Collectively, our data support a model that 25HC inhibits SARS-

181

CoV-2 replication via enhancing endosomal cholesterol levels and blocking virus fusion.

183

The identification of ISGs against different virus families have provided invaluable insights

184

into both virus entry pathways and host innate immune system evolution44, 45, 46, 47. To

185

date, few ISGs that restrict SARS-CoV replication have been identified: GILT48, IFITMs32,

186

and recently published LY6E21, 22. Here, we present evidence that IFN-inducible CH25H

187

and its natural product 25HC restrict S mediated membrane fusion and block SARS-CoV-

188

2 entry into host cells. 25HC has shown broad antiviral activity against a wide range of

189

enveloped viruses26, 28, 49, 50, and non-enveloped viruses such as reovirus51 and murine

190

norovirus52. However, there seems to be two modes of inhibitory mechanisms involved.

191

One requires a high micromolar concentration and more than 6 hours of pre-incubation

192

time to be effective, in the case of reovirus51, pseudorabies virus53 and human

193

papillomavirus-1654,

194

mechanism, whereas the other, which includes influenza A virus26, Lassa fever virus55,

195

hepatitis C virus56, and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2), functions at a low micromolar/high

196

nanomolar range. Combined with the recent report that apilimod, a PIKfyve kinase

197

inhibitor, effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection57, we confirm that this virus reaches

198

late endosomal compartment for membrane fusion and access to the cytosol, at least in

199

ACE2+TMPRSS2- cells. However, our data of endosomal cholesterol accumulation does

200

not explain how the virus-cell fusion at the plasma membrane driven by SARS-CoV-2 S

201

is effectively blocked by 25HC. A recent study demonstrates that 25HC treatment

202

depletes ‘free’ cholesterol from the plasma membrane and prevents Listeria

203

dissemination58. Treatment of cells with 25HC results in reduced cell surface but

204

enhanced intracellular cholesterol levels (Fig. 4D). Therefore, it is plausible that 25HC

205

acts at more than one subcellular compartment and that redistribution of cholesterol leads

of 25HC in conjunction with those targeting the cytoplasmic steps of the SARS-CoV-2

replication cycle such as its main protease59, 60 or polymerase61. Further in vivo studies in

(cholera toxin B, green) and nucleus (DAPI, blue). Scale bar: 30 µm.
(E) HEK293 cells were treated with C4-TopFluor-25HC (10, 1, or 0.1 µM) for 1 hr
and infected with VSV-SARS-CoV-2 (MOI=0.5) for 24 hr. Scale bar: 500 µm.

468

(F) HEK293-hACE2 cells were transfected GFP-tagged wild-type (WT) or dominant

469

negative (DN) mutants of Rab5 or Rab7 for 24 hr. Cells were harvested for western

470

blot and probed for GFP and GAPDH protein levels.

471

For all figures, experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results.

472

Data are represented as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance is from pooled data
