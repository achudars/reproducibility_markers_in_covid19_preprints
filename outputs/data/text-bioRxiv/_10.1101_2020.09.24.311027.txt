Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 is the underlying cause for the COVID-19 pandemic. Like most enveloped RNA viruses,
SARS-CoV-2 uses a homotrimeric surface antigen to gain entry into host cells. Here we describe STrimer, a native-like trimeric subunit vaccine candidate for COVID-19 based on Trimer-Tag technology.
Immunization of S-Trimer with either AS03 (oil-in-water emulsion) or CpG 1018 (TLR9 agonist) plus
alum adjuvants induced high-levels of neutralizing antibodies and Th1-biased cellular immune responses
in animal models. Moreover, rhesus macaques immunized with adjuvanted S-Trimer were protected from
SARS-CoV-2 challenge compared to vehicle controls, based on clinical observations and reduction of
viral loads in lungs. Trimer-Tag may be an important new platform technology for scalable production
and rapid development of safe and effective subunit vaccines against current and future emerging RNA
viruses.

Introduction
Despite tremendous progress made in the past century in eradicating numerous infectious diseases via
vaccinations, enveloped RNA viruses remain a major threat to global public health. Even with partiallyeffective vaccines available, seasonal influenza can lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide
each year (1). Public health experts have warned that a new lethal viral strain of influenza resembling the
1918 H1N1 pandemic strain, which led to an estimated 50 million deaths worldwide a century ago, may
one day emerge again (2). To the surprise of many, coronaviruses that most-often cause mild common
cold have become a major threat to public health since the emergence of SARS-CoV (severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in 2003 (3), followed by MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus) in 2012 (4). In 2020, COVID-19 caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has become a
global pandemic with over 30 million people infected and a death toll of nearly one million people as of
September 2020 (5). The fact that no effective vaccines have ever been successfully developed against
RSV, HIV or any coronavirus, all of which are enveloped RNA viruses, since they were first discovered
decades ago, is a reminder of the challenges faced in developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2.
Similar to other enveloped RNA viruses (such as RSV, HIV and influenza), coronaviruses
including SARS-CoV-2 also use a distinct trimeric antigen (Spike protein) on their viral envelopes to gain
entry into its host cells. The trimeric Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 (angiotensinconverting enzyme 2), the host cell surface receptor, and mediates subsequent viral entry via membrane
fusion (6). COVID-19 symptoms range widely, from mild flu-like symptoms to severe fatal disease that is
characterized by pneumonia and often accompanied by multi-organ system failures. Severe disease
appears to more often occur in certain populations such as the elderly and individuals with risk-factors
such as immune-related diseases, cardiovascular disease and diabetes (7,8). It is hoped that a safe and
effective vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 can be rapidly developed in order to end this global pandemic. To this
end, multiple vaccine strategies have been deployed and have entered into clinical testing, including
mRNA and DNA vaccines, adenovirus-based viral vectors, inactivated SARS-CoV-2, and protein-based
subunit vaccines (9). A successful COVID-19 vaccine that could impact the course of the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic must have four essential characteristics: safety, efficacy, scalability of manufacturing and
distribution, and speed of development (10).
Challenges for developing safe and effective vaccines for RNA viruses are hampered by two
major obstacles: difficulties in inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies such as in the case of HIV and
risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) in the case of RSV (11) and SARSCoV (12). Recombinant subunit HIV vaccines using either monomeric or dimeric gp120 antigens failed
in multiple clinical studies due to lack of efficacy (13). More recently, the revelation that asymptomatic
HIV-positive carriers can produce broadly neutralizing antibodies that only recognize the native trimeric

gp120, but not monomeric gp120 (14-17), implies that preserving the native trimeric conformation of
viral antigens may be important to the future success of vaccines for HIV as well as other enveloped RNA
viruses. The risk of disease enhancement (VAERD) has been a key challenge for the development of
vaccines for RNA viruses causing respiratory disease, as one inactivated RSV vaccine caused clear
disease enhancement and more frequent hospitalizations than placebo in clinical trials decades ago (11),
and similar observations have been made for SARS-CoV vaccine candidates tested in animal models (12).
These challenges and risks may also be encountered in the development of COVID-19 vaccines (9).
Here we describe the use of a platform technology dubbed as Trimer-Tag (18) with a tailored
affinity purification scheme to rapidly produce (in mammalian cells) a native-like trimeric Spike protein
subunit antigen derived from the wild-type viral sequence as a COVID-19 vaccine candidate. We
demonstrate that adjuvanted S-Trimer induced high-levels of neutralizing antibodies as well as Th1biased cellular immune responses in animal models and protected nonhuman primates from SARS-CoV-2
challenge.

Results
High-level expression, purification and characterization of S-Trimer antigen
To rapidly express the S-Trimer antigen, we employed Trimer-Tag technology (18). cDNA encoding the
ectodomain of wild-type SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein (Fig. 1A) was subcloned into the pTRIMER
mammalian expression vector to allow in-frame fusion to Trimer-Tag, which is capable of selftrimerization via disulfide bonds (Fig. 1B). After stable transfection into CHO cells, subsequent screening
for high-titer production clones, and extensive process optimization, a fed-batch serum free cell culture
process in bioreactor was developed leading to high-level expression of S-Trimer as a secreted protein
with a titer around 500 mg/L (Fig. 1C).
To obtain S-Trimer in a highly-purified form for vaccine studies, we developed an affinity
purification scheme (fig. S1A), by taking advantage of the high binding-affinity between Trimer-Tag and
Endo180, a collagen receptor capable of binding to the C- terminal region of Type 1 procollagen (19) and
to mature collagen (20). Endo180-Fc fusion protein (fig. S1B) was loaded onto a Protein A column and
captured by the resins via high-affinity binding between Protein A and human IgG1 Fc domain of
Endo180-Fc. Then, serum-free cell culture medium containing S-Trimer secreted by CHO cells was
loaded onto the Protein A column with pre-captured Endo180-Fc. After washing off any unbound
contaminating host cell proteins (HCP) and other impurities, the bound S-Trimer was purified to near
homogeneity in a single step using moderate salt elution, conditions that do not dissociate Endo180-Fc
from the Protein A column (fig. S1C). S-Trimer was further purified through low pH for preventative

viral inactivation (VI), anion exchange chromatography to remove host cell DNA and any residual
endotoxins, nanofiltration as a preventative viral removal (VR) step and finally UF/DF to concentrate STrimer to the desired concentration in formulation buffer to obtain active drug substance (DS) of STrimer subunit vaccine candidate was obtained (Fig. 1C and fig. S1C). Stability analysis of purified STrimer indicates that S-Trimer is stable in liquid solution formulations at 2-8°C (data not shown).
SDS-PAGE analysis under both non-reducing and reducing conditions confirmed that the purified
S-Trimer was a disulfide bond-linked trimer and partially cleaved at S1/S2 boundary by furin protease
(Fig. 1,C and D), which is produced by CHO cells (21). Under non-reducing conditions, S-Trimer
appeared in multiple high molecular weight forms, likely as a result of partial cleavage of the antigen,
with non-covalently linked and cleaved S1 released during sample treatment. The reduced form of
uncleaved S-Trimer has a molecular weight of around 245 kDa. Peptide sequencing via Edman
degradation confirmed S1/S2 cleavage between 685R-686S and also revealed that the N-terminal amino
acid of S-Trimer was blocked after signal peptide cleavage between 13S-14Q, likely via pyroglutamate
formation at residual 14Q. This was confirmed by subsequent peptide sequencing after pyroglutamate
aminopeptidase removal of 14Q (fig. S2). Protein glycosylation of S-Trimer was analyzed by N- and Olinked deglycosylases, which showed extensive N-linked glycosylation at both S1 and S2 regions,
accounting for about 32% mass (79 kDa) to be glycans based on molecular weight changes of S2-Trimer
and S1 before (129 kDa and 116 kDa) and after deglycosylation (93 kDa and 72 kDa) (Fig. 1E). The
purity of purified S-Trimer was analyzed by size-exclusion SEC-HPLC showing a 96.3% main peak
around 700 Kda and a 3.7% minor peak around 180 Kda identified as cleaved S1 (Fig. 1F, fig. S2). The
binding affinity (KD) of purified S-Trimer to the human ACE2 receptor using ForteBio BioLayer
interferometry was shown to be 1.33 nM (Fig. 1G). Negative-stain EM visualization confirmed that STrimer particles exist predominantly in a metastable, trimeric pre-fusion form resembling the full-length
wild-type spike protein (fig. S3), which was further confirmed by cryo-EM structural studies in the
accompanying paper (22).

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific binding and neutralizing antibodies in convalescent sera with STrimer
S-Trimer was used as an antigen to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding antibodies
and ACE2-competitive antibodies in 41 human convalescent sera samples collected from recovered
COVID-19 patients. High levels of S-Trimer binding antibody and ACE2-competitive titers were detected
in the convalescent sera, as well as high neutralizing antibody titers using a pseudovirus neutralization
assay (Fig. 2A). S-Trimer binding antibodies were not detected in the sera of naïve human volunteers (fig.
S4), whereas antibodies binding to influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-Trimers were detected in both COVID5

19 convalescent sera and naïve sera, implying prior infection by influenza in all subjects tested but only
SARS-CoV-2 infection in the COVID-19 convalescent subjects. These results support the specificity of
the assay and demonstrate the ability of S-Trimer to detect SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein-specific
antibodies in convalescent sera, further confirming the native-like conformation of the Spike antigen in STrimer.
Analysis of antibody titers detected in the convalescent sera was stratified based on various
factors (including COVID-19 disease severity, patient age and patient gender) in 34 subjects for whom
such information was available (Fig. 2B and table S1). Antibody titers were observed to correlate with
disease severity, with lower antibody titers observed in patients with mild COVID-19 disease and higher
titers in severe cases, consistent with findings from other published studies (23,24). ACE2-competitive
antibody titers were detectable in only 33% (n = 3/9) of patients with mild disease, while these antibodies
were present in 82% (n = 14/17) of patients with moderate disease and in 100% (n = 7/7) in patients with
severe disease. Antibody titers also appeared to moderately correlate with patient age, but no differences
were observed between genders.
Antibody titers in human convalescent sera were observed to be correlated between the three
assays utilized (Fig. 2C), and these correlations were further confirmed in sera from animals immunized
with S-Trimer (fig. S5 and table S2). Interestingly, several convalescent sera samples with detectable
pseudoviral neutralizing antibody titers did not have any detectable ACE2-competitive titers (Fig. 2C,
right), suggesting that RBD, which binds to ACE2, is not the only target for neutralizing antibodies, and
other domains such as NTD and S2 may also be important antigenic epitopes for viral neutralization as
previously reported (25,26).

Immunogenicity of S-Trimer in rodents
The immunogenicity of S-Trimer was first evaluated in BALB/c mice. Mice were vaccinated
intramuscularly twice in a two-dose prime-boost regimen (Days 0 and 21) with S-Trimer either nonadjuvanted or with various adjuvants including AS03, CpG 1018, and CpG 1018 plus alum. The adjuvant
effects on humoral immunogenicity were evident, as S-Trimer binding antibody titers, ACE-2 competitive
titers and neutralizing antibody titers in the adjuvanted groups were significantly higher than nonadjuvanted vaccine at corresponding antigen dose levels (Fig. 3,A to C). High levels of neutralizing
antibody titers were only observed in AS03 and CpG 1018 plus alum adjuvanted groups (Fig. 3C), but not
for non-adjuvanted S-Trimer nor with CpG 1018 alone-adjuvanted S-Trimer. S-Trimer adjuvanted with
either AS03 or CpG 1018 plus alum elicited both ACE2-competitve and pseudovirus neutralizing
antibody titers similar to or higher than levels observed in human convalescent sera samples. Similar
results were observed in rats immunized with S-Trimer (fig. S6), albeit at higher overall antibody titers

than in the mouse studies likely in large-part due to the administration of adjuvants (AS03, CpG 1018,
CpG 1018 plus alum) at intended-human dose-levels (10-fold higher for AS03 and 75- to 150-fold higher
for CpG 1018 compared to doses used in mouse studies).
S-Trimer antigen-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI) was studied by harvesting splenocytes
from immunized mice at sacrifice, followed by stimulation with S-Trimer antigen and detection of Th1
(IL-2 and IFN) and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-5) cytokines by ELISpot. The CpG 1018 plus alum and AS03
groups appeared to induce a stronger overall CMI response than non-adjuvanted S-Trimer (Fig. 3D). A
Th1-biased cell-mediated immune response was observed across non-adjuvanted and CpG 1018adjuvanted (with or without alum) S-Trimer groups, while a mixed Th1-Th2 profile was observed for
AS03. CMI did not appear to be dependent on the dose of antigen (fig. S7).

Immunogenicity and immune protection against SARS-CoV-2 Challenge of S-Trimer in nonhuman
primates
The immunogenicity of adjuvanted S-Trimer was further studied in nonhuman primates (rhesus
macaques). Animals (n = 6 per group) were vaccinated intramuscularly twice (at Day 0 and 21) with
AS03-adjuvanted S-Trimer, CpG 1018 plus alum-adjuvanted S-Trimer, or a PBS vehicle control. The
animals were then challenged on Day 35 with 2.6 x 106 TCID50 (60% intratracheal and 40% intranasal)
SARS-CoV-2 virus and then evaluated for immune protection by various parameters.
High levels of binding and neutralizing antibody titers measured by different methods, including
wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization assay, were observed in both groups receiving adjuvanted STrimer (Fig. 4,A to D). The boost-effect of the second dose (on Day 21) was evident, with significant
increases in neutralizing antibody levels observed at Day 28 and continuing to rise through Day 35 prior
to challenge. At Day 35, neutralizing antibody titers in the AS03-adjuvanted S-Trimer group were
significantly higher than levels in human convalescent sera (Fig. 4). For animals in the CpG 1018 plus
alum group, despite exhibiting numerically lower binding and neutralizing antibody titers than the AS03adjuvanted S-Trimer group, levels of antibodies were still within the range of human convalescent sera
(Fig. 4). Moreover, animals in the CpG 1018 plus alum group also appeared to mount a rapid and more
durable lymphocyte response that remained high 7 days after viral challenge, compared to AS03 and
vehicle groups (fig. S8). Interestingly, antibody titers post-viral challenge appeared to modestly decrease
following challenge at Day 40 (5 days post inoculation [dpi]), suggesting that challenge with high doses
of SARS-CoV-2 may have led to rapid binding of circulating anti-Spike antibodies to the virus and
subsequent clearance; a similar trend was reported in convalescent humans that were re-exposed to the
virus (27).

Following challenge with SARS-CoV-2, animals in the adjuvanted S-Trimer groups were
protected from body weight loss, whereas animals in the vehicle control group observed rapid body
weight loss of approximately 8% through 7 dpi (Fig. 5A and fig. S9), in line with other reported studies
(28). Similarly, animals receiving adjuvanted S-Trimer appeared to be protected from increases in body
temperature following SARS-CoV-2 challenge (Fig. 5B). Various blood chemistry parameters also
suggested that animals in the active vaccine groups may have been protected from organ and tissue
damage and other adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection (fig. S10), as animals in the vehicle control
group observed increases in blood albumin (ALB), A/G ratio, AST, creatine kinase (CK), glucose (GLU),
lactic acid (LAC), and triglycerides (TRIG) through 7 dpi compared to the adjuvanted S-Trimer groups.
Lung tissues were harvested at necropsy from 5 to 7 dpi and tested for SARS-CoV-2 viral loads
based on genomic RNA (gRNA). Complete reduction of viral loads in lung tissues was observed in AS03
and CpG 1018 plus alum adjuvanted S-Trimer groups, whereas viral loads were detectable in the vehicle
group (Fig. 5C and fig. S11). Similar trends of reduced viral loads in animals receiving active vaccine
were observed from throat swabs, anal swabs and tracheal brushes after challenge through 7 dpi (Fig.
5D). Viral gRNA detected in nasal swabs were expected given the location of viral challenge and is not
necessarily indicative of replicating virus. Histopathological analysis conducted in lung tissues and IHC
staining with antibody specific to the Spike protein further confirmed the reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection
in animals vaccinated with S-Trimer (Fig. 5E).

D614G mutation in SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein does not alter receptor binding nor escape from
neutralizing antibodies elicited by S-Trimer
Since SARS-CoV-2 with D614G mutation in the Spike protein has become the predominant circulating
strain in many regions of the world (29), we also produced S-Trimer with the D614G mutation. The
results showed that, compared to the wild-type S-Trimer, no significant differences were observed in
ACE2 binding affinity, nor ACE2 competitive binding against anti-Spike neutralizing antibodies
produced from animals immunized with wild-type S-Trimer (fig. S12).

Discussion
S-Trimer resembles native SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in structure and functions
Unlike other full-length Spike proteins previously used for structural studies and vaccine development
that utilized mutations introduced to abolish S1/S2 cleavage by furin protease and reportedly stabilize the
protein in a prefusion form (6,30), S-Trimer is partially cleaved at the S1/S2 junction, similar to S

proteins isolated from live SARS-CoV-2 virus (31) and recombinant full-length S expressed in HEK293
cells (32). Importantly, we demonstrated that the S-Trimer vaccine candidate, with a fully wild-type S
sequence from SARS-CoV-2, is not only expressed at high levels in CHO cells but also is highly
glycosylated and adopts a native-like trimeric pre-fusion conformation. N-terminal protein sequence
analysis revealed that upon signal peptide removal during its biosynthesis, S-Trimer has N-terminal 14Q
modified by pyroglutamate formation to protect itself from exo-protease degradation, suggesting that S
protein from SARS-CoV-2 can be very stable in vivo. Fusion to Trimer-Tag allows the soluble wild-type
S protein to form a disulfide bond-linked homotrimer with a partially-cleaved S1 that remains
noncovalently bound to S-Trimer and also to maintain high affinity binding to the ACE2 receptor, thus
preserving the crucial antigenic epitopes necessary for viral neutralization.
In addition to tailored-affinity purification scheme we developed for any Trimer-Tagged fusion
proteins followed by further downstream purification steps typical for the production of modern biologics
to ensure purity and safety (including preventative VI and VR), the current titer in bioreactor of
approximately 500 mg/L would predict that billions of doses of S-Trimer antigen to be used in a COVID19 vaccine may be produced annually from several 2,000L bioreactors. The potential production output of
S-Trimer antigen further supports the rationale to advance its clinical development with multiple
adjuvants in parallel (such as AS03 and CpG 1018 plus alum), should supply of a single adjuvant be a
limiting factor for the global supply of the vaccine (antigen plus adjuvant). A Phase I clinical trial is
currently ongoing to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of S-Trimer with AS03 and CpG 1018 plus
Alum adjuvants (NCT04405908).

Insights from the analysis of antibody titers in human convalescent sera
Understanding which components of the immune system are needed to confer optimal immune protection
against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease is critical to the development of effective
vaccines. It has been reported that individuals with mild COVID-19 disease observe low or undetectable
levels of neutralizing antibodies (23,24), and approximately 35% of SARS-CoV-2 naïve individuals have
cross-reactive CD4+ T-cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 antigens due to prior infection by other commoncold coronaviruses (33). In this study, a clear association between higher antibody titers specific to
SARS-CoV-2 and more severe disease was observed, using a panel of 41 human convalescent sera
samples collected from recovered COVID-19 patients. In fact, most patients with mild COVID-19 disease
did not have any detectable ACE2-competitive titers and only had low neutralizing antibody titers (Fig.
2B), implying that a strong neutralizing humoral immune response may not be the only component of the
immune system that is involved in the prevention or recovery from COVID-19 disease. These
observations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could be particularly susceptible to cell-mediated immune

responses, and some patients that develop rapid adaptive T-cell responses may not additionally need high
levels of neutralizing antibodies to eliminate the virus. Indeed, it has been reported that patients with
asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 disease develop robust T-cell immunity, while patients with severe
COVID-19 disease observed T-cells at unphysiologically low levels (34) and potentially require higher
levels of neutralizing antibodies in order to mount an effective recovery. While neutralizing monoclonal
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein have been demonstrated to be protective against viral
challenge in animals (35,36), it appears likely that COVID-19 vaccines inducing both humoral and cellmediated immune responses may confer optimal protection against SARS-CoV-2.

Adjuvanted S-Trimer induces high levels of neutralizing antibodies in rodents and protective immunity
in non-human primates
Vaccine adjuvants can contribute to achieving stronger immune responses to a viral antigen. The use of
an adjuvant is of particular importance in a pandemic situation, since it could reduce the amount of
antigen required per dose, allowing significantly more doses of vaccine to be produced and therefore
contributing to the protection of more people. Importantly, AS03, CpG 1018 and alum adjuvants have all
been utilized in commercially-licensed vaccines and have significant safety databases in clinical and postmarketing studies (37,38).
In our studies, we have observed significant adjuvant effects of AS03 and CpG 1018 plus alum,
with robust high-level induction of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to S-Trimer in
rodents and nonhuman primates. Interestingly, we did observe some differences in the immune responses
stimulated by these two adjuvant systems. In nonhuman primates, AS03 appeared to induce a stronger
humoral immune response, inducing higher levels of neutralizing antibody titers than CpG 1018 plus
alum. While antibody titers were lower in nonhuman primates for CpG 1018 plus alum (albeit still in the
range of or higher than human convalescent sera), CpG 1018 plus alum did appear to potentially induce a
durable cellular immune response (as measured by lymphocyte frequency) in nonhuman primates and was
more strongly Th1-biased in rodents. However, there were no clear differences in the immune protection
against SARS-CoV-2 challenge observed between the two adjuvant systems in nonhuman primates,
suggesting that both adjuvants had induced sufficient and protective levels of immunity. Importantly, no
signs of disease enhancement were observed, a theoretical concern for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on
prior experience with vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV and RSV that utilized inactivated viruses
(11,12).
Our data demonstrate that S-Trimer adjuvanted with either AS03 or CpG 1018 plus alum can
induce robust humoral and cellular immune responses in various animal species and protective immunity
against SARS-CoV-2 infection in nonhuman primates, with no signs of disease enhancement.

Collectively, these results support the advancement of adjuvanted S-Trimer through human clinical
studies to further demonstrate safety, immunogenicity, and vaccine efficacy. Importantly, the recombinant
production of S-Trimer utilizing Trimer-Tag technology has been streamlined with the ability to be
rapidly scaled-up to billions of doses annually, and the subunit vaccine can be stored at 2-8°C (does not
require frozen storage conditions). These advantages could allow S-Trimer vaccine candidate, if
successful in clinical studies, to contribute significantly to the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. A
Phase 1 clinical study was initiated in June 2020 (NCT04405908), and late-stage clinical studies to
evaluate vaccine efficacy and safety are also planned. Should adjuvanted S-Trimer be proven successful
as a COVID-19 subunit vaccine, Trimer-Tag may become an important new platform technology for
rapid responses to future threats posed by any emerging enveloped RNA viruses.

Fig. 2. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Binding and Neutralizing Antibodies in Human COVID-19
Convalescent Sera. 41 human convalescent sera collected from recovered COVID-19 subjects were
analyzed for (A) S-Trimer binding antibody titers, ACE2-competitive titers and pseudovirus
neutralization titers. (B) Antibody titers were stratified based on patient COVID-19 disease severity,
patient age and gender in 34 subjects where such information was available. (C) Antibody titers in the
human convalescent sera for the three assays (S-Trimer binding antibodies, ACE2-competitive, and
pseudovirus neutralization) were analyzed for correlation. Points represent individual humans; horizontal
lines indicate geometric mean titers (GMT) of EC50 for each group ±SEM.

Fig. 3. Immunogenicity of S-Trimer in Mice. BALB/c mice (n=7-8/group) were immunized with
various doses of S-Trimer that was non-adjuvanted or adjuvanted with 25 µL AS03, 10 µg CpG 1018, or
10 µg CpG 1018 plus 50 µg alum twice on Day 0 and Day 21. The humoral immune responses on Day 35
were analyzed and compared with a human convalescent sera (HCS) panel (n=41), based on (A) S-Trimer
binding antibody ELISA titers, (B) ACE2-competitive ELISA titers, and (C) SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus
neutralization titers. After necropsy, splenocytes were harvested from mice and stimulated with S-Trimer
antigen, followed by (D) detection of Th1 (IL-2, IFN) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5) cytokines by ELISpot.
ELISpot data shown represents pooled data across S-Trimer doses. Points represent individual animals or
humans; horizontal lines indicate geometric mean titers (GMT) for antibody assays and mean values for
ELISpot assay for each group ±SEM.

Materials and Methods

Animal studies, facilities and ethics statements
Specific pathogen-free (SPF) BALB/c female mice (6-8 weeks old) for immunogenicity studies
were purchased from Chengdu Dossy Experimental Animals Co., LTD and kept under standard
pathogen-free conditions in the animal care center at Chengdu Hi-tech Incubation Park. All
mouse experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC)
and were conducted according to international guidelines for animal studies. Sprague Dawley
(SD) rats immunogenicity studies were performed at JOINN Laboratories Inc. (Suzhou, China),
and SD rats (6-9 weeks old) were purchased from Zhejiang Vital River Laboratory Animal
Technology Co., Ltd. Studies with SD rats were compliant with the policies of JOINN
Laboratories Inc., the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th Edition, Institute of
Laboratory Animal Resources, Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council;
National Academy Press; Washington, D.C., 2010), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture
through the Animal Welfare Act (Public Law 99-198). The Rhesus Macaque SARS-CoV-2
challenge study was performed at Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS), and male animals 3-6 years of age were used for the study. The biosafety level 3 (BSL3)
lab at CAS followed the international guidelines for the animal experiment and approved by the
institutional animal ethics committee (IACUC) prior to the studies. All study designs were
reviewed by GSK.

Human COVID-19 convalescent serum samples
41 human convalescent sera samples from recovered COVID-19 patients (table S1) were obtained
from Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu in Chengdu, China, under approved guidelines by
the Institutional Review Board (IRB), and all patients had provided written informed consent
before sera sample were collected. All convalescent sera samples were heat inactivated at 55°C
for 30 min before being used for analysis.

Adjuvants
AS03 (37,39) was manufactured under GMP by GSK Vaccines. AS03 is an Adjuvant System
containing α-tocopherol and squalene in an oil-in-water emulsion. CpG 1018 (38) was

manufactured under GMP by Dynavax Technologies. CpG 1018, a TLR-9 agonist, is a synthetic
CpG-B class oligonucleotide having a phosphorothioate-backbone and the sequence 5′TGACTGTGAACGTTCGAGATGA-3′. Alum hydroxide was manufactured under GMP by
Croda. The S-Trimer subunit vaccines were mixed with the adjuvants by gentle inversion in 1:1
ratio by volume preceding each immunization.

Protein expression and purification
To produce the wild-type secreted S-Trimer fusion protein, a cDNA encoding the ectodomain of
wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein (amino acid residues 1 to 1211) (GenBank:
MN908947.3) was gene-synthesized using Cricetulus griseus (Chinese hamster)-preferred codons
by GenScript. The cDNA was subcloned into pTRIMER expression vector (GenHunter
Corporation) at Hind III and Bgl II sites to allow in-frame fusion of the soluble S protein to
Trimer-Tag as described previously (18). The expression vector was transfected into GH-CHO
(dhfr-/-) cell line (GenHunter Corporation) using FUGENE 6 (Roche) and grown in IMDM
medium with 10% FBS. After stepwise gene amplification with increasing concentrations (0.0–10
nM) of MTX (Sigma), the clones producing the highest S-Trimer titer were then adapted to SFM4CHO serum-free medium (GE BioSciences). The secreted S-Trimer fusion protein was then
produced in 15 L bioreactors (Applikon) using a fed-batch process with Cell Boost 2 supplement
(GE Hyclone) per instructions from the manufacturer. S-Trimer (D614G mut) was generated by
site-directed mutagenesis using mutagenesis primer pair (5’- gccgtgctgtatcagggcgtgaattgtaccgag 3’ and 5’- ctcggtacaattcacgccctgatacagcacggc -3’) and wild-type S-Trimer expression vector as a
template following the protocol of QuikChange kit (Strategene). The expression vectors were
transient transfected into HEK-293F cell lines (Clover Biopharma) using PEI (Polyscience) and
grown in OPM-293 CD05 medium (OPM) with OPM-293 proFeed supplement (OPM).

After harvesting the clarified cell culture medium via depth-filtration (Millipore) to remove cells,
S-Trimer was purified to homogeneity by consecutive chromatographic steps. A Protein A
affinity column using MabSelect PrismA (GE Healthcare) preloaded with Endo180-Fc was used
to affinity-capture S-Trimer, based on the high affinity binding between Endo180 and Trimer-Tag
(19) (fig. S1). After washing off unbound contaminating proteins, S-Trimer was eluted using 0.5
M NaCl in phosphate buffered saline, conditions that do not elute Endo180-Fc from Protein A.

After one hour of low pH (pH 3.5) viral inactivation (VI) using acetic acid, the pH was adjusted
to neutral range before loading onto Capto QXP resins (GE BioSceinces) in a flow-through mode
to remove host cell DNA and residual host cell proteins (HCP). Then, a preventative viral
removal (VR) step using nanofiltration followed by a final UF/DF (Millipore) for buffer change
were used to achieve the S-Trimer active drug substance (DS).

Endo180-Fc expression vector was generated by subcloning a PCR amplified cDNA encoding
soluble human Endo180 (amino acid residue 1-1394) (19) into the HindIII site of pGH-hFc
expression vector (GenHunter Corporation) to allow in-frame fusion to human IgG Fc. The
expression vector was transfected into GH-CHO (dhfr-/-) cell line (GenHunter Corporation) using
FUGENE 6 (Roche) and grown in IMDM medium with 10% FBS. After stepwise gene
amplification with increasing concentrations (0.0–10 nM) of MTX (Sigma), a high titer clone was
then adapted to SFM-4CHO serum-free medium (GE BioSciences). The secreted End0180-Fc
fusion protein was then produced in 15 L bioreactors (Applikon) using a fed-batch process with
Cell Boost 2 supplement (GE Hyclone) per instructions from the manufacturer. Endo180-Fc was
purified to homogeneity by protein A affinity chromatography using MabSelect PrismA (GE
Healthcare) followed by Capto QXP resins (GE BioSceinces) in a flow-through mode to remove
any host cell DNA and residual host cell proteins (HCP).

ACE2-Fc expression vector was generated by subcloning a gene-synthesized cDNA template
(GenScript) encoding soluble human ACE2 (amino acid residue 1-738, accession number:
NM_001371415.1) into Hind III and Bgl II sites of pGH-hFc expression vector (GenHunter
Corporation) to allow in-frame fusion to human IgG Fc. The expression vector was then stably
transfected into GH-CHO (dhfr -/-) cell line and high expression clones were selected and
adapted to SFM-4-CHO (Hyclone) serum free medium and ACE2-Fc was produced in 15 L
bioreactors, as described for Endo180-Fc above. ACE2-Fc was purified to homogeneity from the
conditioned medium using PoRos XQ column (Thermo Fisher) following the manufacturer’s
instructions.

To produce the influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-Trimer antigens, cDNA encoding the ectodomains
of HA (amino acid residues 1-518 of H1N1 HA, 1-513 of H3N2 HA, 1-546 of B1 HA and 1-547

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.24.311027; this version posted September 24, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

of B2 HA) (EpiFluDatabase Accession Nos. EPI516535, EPI614444, EPI540675, EPI498048,
respectively) were gene-synthesized using Cricetulus griseus -preferred codons by GenScript.
Then cDNAs were cloned into pTRIMER expression vector (consistent with S-Trimer
construction). pTRIMER expression vectors containing HA ectodomain-encoding sequence were
transfected into GH-CHO (dhfr-/-) cell lines using FUGENE 6 and grown in IMDM medium with
10% FBS. After stepwise gene amplification with increasing concentrations (0.0–0.5 μM) of
MTX (Sigma), clones producing the highest HA-Trimer titers were then adapted to SFM-4-CHO,
and HA-Trimers were produced in 1L shake-flasks using fed-batch processes with CellBoost 2
supplement (GE Hyclone). After completion of the upstream cell culture process, HA-Trimers
were purified from cell-free culture media after centrifugation at 3000g for 20 min, followed by
using a 5 mL Blue Sepharose column (GE Healthcare, Logan, UT, USA) under a salt-gradient
(0.1-0.5 M NaCl) elution. Fractions corresponding to HA-Trimers were further polished via gel
filtration using Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) according to manufacturer’s instructions to change
buffer and then concentrated by ultrafiltration into PBS.

SEC-HPLC
The purity of S-Trimer was analyzed by Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC-HPLC) using
Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC with an analytic TSK gel G3000 SWxL column (Tosoh). Phosphate
Buffered Saline (PBS) was used as the mobile phase with OD280 nm detection over a 20 min
period at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.

Receptor binding studies of S-Trimer to human ACE2
The binding affinity of S-Trimer to ACE2 was assessed by Bio-Layer Interferometry
measurements on ForteBio Octet QKe (Pall). ACE2-Fc (10 µg/mL) was immobilized on Protein
A (ProA) biosensors (Pall). Real-time receptor-binding curves were obtained by applying the
sensor in two-fold serial dilutions of S-Trimer (22.5-36 µg/mL in PBS). Kinetic parameters (Kon
and Koff) and affinities (KD) were analyzed using Octet software, version 12.0. Dissociation
constants (KD) were determined using steady state analysis, assuming a 1:1 binding model for a
S-Trimer to ACE2-Fc.

S-Trimer was diluted to 25 ug/mL in PBS with pH adjusted to 5.5 with acetic acid and applied for
1 min onto the carbon-coated 400 CU mesh grid that had been glow-discharged at 12mA for 20s.
The grids were negatively stained with 1% (w/v) uranyl formate at pH 4.0 for 1 min. The samples
were collected through FEI Tecnai spirit electron microscope operating at 120 KeV.

Immunogenicity analysis of S-Trimer in rodents
BALB/c mice (n=7-8/group, female) were used for immunogenicity studies. Mice were
immunized intramuscularly (IM) with various doses of S-Trimer (3µg, 9µg, 30µg/dose) that was
non-adjuvanted or adjuvanted with 25 µL of AS03 (GSK), 10 µg of CpG 1018 (Dynavax), or 10
µg of CpG 1018 plus 50 µg of Alum (Croda). The total injection volume of the mixed vaccines
(antigen + adjuvant) was 50 µL per IM dose. Two IM doses were administered (at Day 0 and Day
21). Animals were bled from the tail veins for humoral immune response analyses. Spleens were
removed after sacrifice at Day 35 for ELISpot assays.

SD rats (n=10/group, half male and female) were immunized IM with various doses of S-Trimer
(3µg, 9µg, 30µg/dose) that was non-adjuvanted or adjuvanted with 0.25 mL of AS03 (GSK), 1.5
mg of CpG 1018 (Dynavax), or 1.5 mg of CpG 1018 plus 0.375 mg of Alum (Croda). The total
injection volume of mixed vaccines (antigen + adjuvant) was 0.5 mL per IM dose for animals
receiving AS03- and CpG 1018-adjuvanted S-Trimer and 0.75 mL per IM dose for CpG 1018
plus alum-adjuvanted S-Trimer. Total injection volume for vehicle control was 0.5 mL per IM
dose. Three IM immunizations were administered (at Day 0, Day 14 and Day 28). Animals from
the negative control group were injected with PBS. Animals were bled from the jugular veins for
humoral immune response analyses.

S-Trimer (or HA-Trimer) binding antibody ELISA assays
S-Trimer binding antibody titers (or HA-Trimer binding antibody titers) in sera samples collected
from immunized animals was determined by ELISA. 96-well plates (Corning) were coated with
S-Trimer (or HA-Trimer) (1μg/mL, 100 μL/well) at 4℃ overnight and blocked with 2% non-fat
milk at 37℃ for 2 h. Serial dilutions of the antisera were added to the wells. After incubating for
1h at 37℃, the plates were washed 3 times with PBST (PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20),
followed by incubating with goat anti-mouse, rat, monkey, or human IgG-HRP (Southern

Biotech) at 37℃ for 30 min. Plates were then washed 3 times with PBST and signals were
developed using TMB substrate (Thermo Scientific). The colorimetric reaction was stopped after
5 min by adding 2M HCl. The optical density (OD) was measured at 450 nm. Antibody titers
(EC50) were defined as the reciprocal of the dilution from a sample at which 50% of the
maximum absorbance was observed. A modified logit-log equation ("Fit Equation") was used to
fit serum titration data for EC50 determination.

ACE2-competitive ELISA assay
96-well plates (Corning) were coated with 1 μg/mL ACE2-Fc (100 μL/well) at 4℃ overnight,
blocked with 2% non-fat milk 37℃ for 2 h. After washing 3 times with PBST, the plates were
incubated with S-Trimer (100 ng/mL) mixed with serially diluted antisera for 1 h at 37℃. After
washing 3 times with PBST, the plates were incubated with rabbit anti-Trimer-Tag antibody
(Clover Biopharma) at 37℃ for 1 h, followed by washing 3 times with PBST and then a 1:20000
dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Southern Biotech). After washing 3 times with PBST, TMB
(Thermo Scientific) was added for signal development. The percentage of inhibition was
calculated as follows: % inhibition = [(A-Blank)-(P-Blank)]/(A-Blank)x100, where A is the
maximum OD signal of S-Trimer binding to ACE2-Fc when no serum was present, and P is the
OD signal of S-Trimer binding to ACE2-Fc in presence of serum at a given dilution .The IC50 of a
given serum sample was defined as the reciprocal of the dilution where the sample shows 50%
competition.

Pseudovirus neutralization assay
SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay was conducted as previously described (40), with
some modifications. To evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization activity of antisera,
samples were first heat-inactivated for 30 min and serially diluted (3-fold), incubated with an
equal volume of 325 TCID50 pseudovirus at 37°C for 1 h, along with virus-alone (positive
control) and cell-alone (negative control). Then, freshly-trypsinized Vero-E6 cells were added to
each well at 20000 cells/well. Following 24 h incubation at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator, the cells
were lysed and luciferase activity was determined by a Luciferase Assay System (Beyotime),
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The EC50 neutralizing antibody titer of a given serum

sample was defined as the reciprocal of the dilution where the sample showed the relative light
units (RLUs) were reduced by 50% compared to virus alone control wells.

Splenocyte stimulation and ELISpot assay
To detect antigen-specific T-cell responses, ELISpot kits (Mabtech) measuring Th1 cytokines
(IFN-γ, IL-2) and Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5) were used per manufacturer’s instructions.
Splenocytes from immunized mice or PBMC from immunized Rhesus were harvested 2 weeks
after the second IM immunization. 5 x 105 splenocytes or PBMC/well (96-well plate) were
stimulated in vitro with 100 nM S-Trimer antigen. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and
ionomycin as the non-specific stimulus were added to the positive control wells, whereas the
negative control well received no stimuli. After 48 h incubation, biotinylated detection antibodies
from the ELISpot kits and SA-ALP/SA-HRP were added. Blots were developed by the addition
of BCIP/NBT or AEC substrate solution, which produced colored spots after 5-30 min incubation
in the dark. Finally, the IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-5 spot-forming cells (SFCs) were counted using
an automatic ELISpot reader.

SARS-CoV-2 viral challenge study in Rhesus Macaques
The animal model for SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques was conducted as previously
described (41,42). Rhesus Macaques (3-6 years old) were randomized into 3 groups of 6 animals,
and immunized intramuscularly with either PBS as a negative control, or 30 μg S-Trimer
adjuvanted with 0.25 mL AS03, or 30 μg S-Trimer adjuvanted with 1.5 mg CpG 1018 plus 0.75
mg alum. The total injection volume of mixed vaccines (antigen + adjuvant) was 0.5 mL per IM
dose for animals receiving AS03- and CpG 1018-adjuvanted S-Trimer and 0.75 mL per IM dose
for CpG 1018 plus alum-adjuvanted S-Trimer. Total injection volume for vehicle control was 0.5
mL per IM dose. All groups of animals were immunized twice (on Day 0 and 21) before viral
challenge. The immunized animals were challenged with a dose of 2.6 x106 TCID50 SARS-CoV2 virus both intratracheally (60% of challenge dose) and intranasally (40% of challenge dose) on
Day 35. SARS-CoV-2 strain 107 used was obtained from the Guangdong Provincial CDC,
Guangdong, China. Blood samples were collected on Day -1, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 (before
challenge) as well as 1, 3, 5, 7 days post-inoculation (dpi) for antibody assays, routine blood tests,
blood chemistry and hematology. Clinical observations were performed on Day 35 and 1, 3, 5, 7

dpi, including body weight and body temperature. Tracheal brushing and various swabs (throat
and anal) were collected 3, 5, and 7 dpi, and total RNA was extracted for viral load analysis by
qRT-PCR. At 5 dpi, 2 rhesus macaques per group were euthanized, and at 7dpi, the remaining
animals were euthanized. Lung tissue samples were homogenized, and total RNA was extracted
for viral load analysis by qRT-PCR. For detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, primers and
probes used in this experiment included: forward primer 5’-GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT3’, reverse primer 5’-CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG-3’, and probe FAMTTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3’, as previously described (41,42). Pathological
examination by H&E staining and IHC staining with a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for
S1 of SARS-CoV-2 (Clover Biopharma) were conducted.

Wild-type SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay
Wild-type SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay was performed in the BSL-3 lab at Kunming
Institute of Zoology, CAS. Vero-E6 cells (2×104 per well) were seeded in a 96-well plate
overnight. On a separate 96-well plate plate, heat-inactivated antisera (56°C for 30 min) from
Rhesus Macaques were serially diluted in cell culture medium in 3-fold dilutions starting from
1:100. The diluted sera were mixed with an equal volume of solution containing 100 TCID50 live
SARS-CoV-2 virus in each well. After 1 h incubation at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator, the virusserum mixtures were transferred to the 96-well plate containing Vero-E6 cells and cultured in a
5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for 6 days. Cytopathic effect (CPE) of each well was recorded under
microscopes, and the neutralization titer (MN50) was calculated as the reciprocal of serum
dilution required for 50% neutralization of viral infection.

Histology and immunohistochemistry
Lung tissues collected from the Rhesus Macaques after SARS-COV-2 viral challenge were fixed
in 10% formalin and paraffin embedded. Sections (5 µm) were prepared and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). For SARS-CoV-2 viral detection, immunohistochemical staining
for SARS-CoV2-S antigen was carried out by incubating a mouse monoclonal antibody specific
to S1 of SARS-CoV-2 (Clover Biopharma) overnight at 4°C. After washing with PBST, HRPconjugated secondary antibody (ZSGB Bio PV-6002) was added for 1h at room temperature, the

sections were developed with DAB (ZSGB Bio ZLI-9017), and mounted with Neutral Balsam for
analysis under an upright microscope (BX53, Olympus).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using the Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software). Two-sided MannWhitney tests were used to compare two experiment groups. Comparisons among multiple groups
were performed using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA with Dunn’s multiple comparisons tests. Twoway ANOVA test with Tukey’s multiple comparison test was applied for multiple groups at
different time points. P values < 0.05 were considered significant. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P <
0.001, ****P < 0.0001. NS, no significance.

Fig. S2. N-terminal peptide sequencing of partially-cleaved S-Trimer. Initial results showed the fulllength S-Trimer could not be sequenced directly by Edman degradation method, while S2-Trimer fragment
yield peptide sequence shown with predicted furin protease cleavage at S1/S2 boundary. Following the
removal of 14Q by pyroglutamate aminopeptidase, the N-terminal sequence for the full-length S-Trimer
was determined by subsequent Edman degradation as indicated. Since the S2-Trimer had predicted Nterminus after furin cleavage, the N-terminus of S1 was predicted to be the same as that of full-length STrimer.

Fig. S6. Immunogenicity of S-Trimer in SD rats. SD Rats (n=10/group) were immunized with 30 µg of STrimer adjuvanted with PBS vehicle control, 30 µg S-Trimer (non-adjuvanted), 30 µg S-Trimer adjuvanted with
0.25 mL of AS03, 30 µg S-Trimer adjuvanted with 1.5 mg CpG 1018, or 30 µg S-Trimer adjuvanted with 0.75
mg CpG 1018 plus 0.375 mg alum three times on Day 0, Day 14 and Day 28. The humoral immune responses and
kinetics were analyzed and compared with a human convalescent sera (HCS) panel, based on (A) S-Trimer
binding antibody ELISA titers and (B) SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization titers. Data are presented as
geometric mean titers (GMT) ±SEM. Antibody titers two weeks after the second immunization on Day 28 (prior
to the third immunization) are shown for (C) S-Trimer binding antibody ELISA titers, (D) ACE2-competitive
ELISA titers, and (E) SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization titers. Points represent individual animals and
humans; horizontal lines indicate GMT of EC50 for each group; kinetics data are presented as GMT ±SEM.

Fig. S7. Th1 and Th2 cell-mediated immune response of S-Trimer in mice by ELISpot. BALB/c mice (n=78/group) were immunized with various doses of S-Trimer that was non-adjuvanted or adjuvanted with AS03, CpG
1018-alone, or CpG 1018 plus alum twice on Day 0 and Day 21. After necropsy, splenocytes were harvested from
mice (n=2-6/group) and stimulated with S-Trimer antigen, followed by detection of Th1 (IL-2, IFN) and Th2
(IL-4, IL-5) cytokines by ELISpot for the (A) non-adjuvanted S-Trimer groups, (B) AS03-adjuvanted S-Trimer
groups, (C) CpG 1018-adjuvanted S-Trimer groups, and (D) CpG 1018 plus alum adjuvanted S-Trimer groups.
Points represent individual animals; horizontal lines indicate mean values for each group.

Fig. S11. Viral loads in lung tissues in Rhesus Macaques at necropsy following SARS-CoV-2 challenge.
Rhesus macaques (n=6/group) were immunized with 30 μg S-Trimer adjuvanted with 0.25 mL AS03, 30 μg STrimer adjuvanted with 1.5 mg CpG 1018 plus 0.75 mg alum, or PBS vehicle control twice on Day 0 and Day 21
and were challenged on Day 35 with 2.6 x 106 TCID50 (60% intratracheal and 40% intranasal) live SARS-CoV-2
virus. Following SARS-CoV-2 challenge and after necropsy at 5 dpi (n=2/group) and 7 dpi (n=4/group), various
lung and trachea tissues were collected for measurement of viral loads based on genomic RNA (gRNA). Points
represent individual animals; horizontal lines indicate geometric mean values for each group.
