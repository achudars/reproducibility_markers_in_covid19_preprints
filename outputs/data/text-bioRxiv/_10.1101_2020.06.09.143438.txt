ABSTRACT
SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-191, recognizes host cells by attaching
its receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the host receptor ACE22-7. Neutralizing
antibodies that block RBD-ACE2 interaction have been a major focus for therapeutic
development8-18. Llama-derived single-domain antibodies (nanobodies, ~15 kDa) offer
advantages including ease of production and possibility for direct delivery to the lungs
by nebulization19, which are attractive features for bio-drugs against the global
respiratory disease. Here, we generated 99 synthetic nanobodies (sybodies) by in vitro
selection using three libraries. The best sybody, MR3 bound to RBD with high affinity
(KD = 1.0 nM) and showed high neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2
pseudoviruses (IC50 = 0.40 g mL-1). Structural, biochemical, and biological
characterization of sybodies suggest a common neutralizing mechanism, in which the
RBD-ACE2 interaction is competitively inhibited by sybodies. Various forms of sybodies
with improved potency were generated by structure-based design, biparatopic
construction, and divalent engineering. Among these, a divalent MR3 conjugated with

47

the albumin-binding domain for prolonged half-life displayed highest potency (IC50 =
12 ng mL-1) and protected mice from live SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Our results pave the
way to the development of therapeutic nanobodies against COVID-19 and present a

48

strategy for rapid responses for future outbreaks.

INTRODUCTION
The coronavirus disease that emerged in early December 2019 (COVID-19)1 poses
a global health and economic crisis20. The causative agent, SARS-CoV-2, uses its Spike
protein (S) to recognize receptors on host cells, an initial step for viral infection2,3,21,22.
Key to this virus-host interaction is the binding between the S receptor-binding domain
(RBD) and the host ACE2 protein4-7. Therefore, the RBD has been a primary target for
neutralizing antibodies8-13,23 to block ACE2-binding.

Llama-derived nanobodies are generally more heat stable, easier and less
expensive for production, and more amenable to protein engineering compared to
conventional antibodies24. As single-chain antibodies, nanobody libraries are less
complex to construct and screen, enabling in vitro selection of high-affinity binders in
relative short time, typically 2-4 weeks25-30. Recently, several nanobody therapeutics,
including the caplacizumab approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, have
been developed for a variety of immune diseases31. Of relevance to SARS-CoV-2,
nanobodies can survive nebulization and an inhaler nanobody drug (ALX-0171) has
gone into clinical trials for the treatment of the Respiratory Syncytial Virus31. Recent
weeks have witnessed the generation of nanobodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 from
several independent groups14-18. However, the in vivo efficacy of such nanobodies
remains to be investigated.

Here, we report our efforts in selection and engineering synthetic nanobodies
(sybodies)26 that are highly potent against SARS-CoV-2, using biochemical and
structural approaches. For the first time, we demonstrate that nanobodies can protect
mice from live SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results form a preliminary basis for the
development of nanobody therapeutics for COVID-19.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Generation of high-affinity neutralizing sybodies against SARS-CoV-2

79

83

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD binders were selected by performing one round of ribosome
display using three high-diversity libraries (Concave, Loop, and Convex)26,27, and three
rounds of phage display using the RBD as the bait under increasingly stringent
conditions. Subsequent ELISA (Extended Data Fig. 1) identified 80, 77, and 90 positive
clones, corresponding to 62, 19, and 18 unique binders from the Concave, Loop, and

84

Convex library, respectively (Extended Data Table 1). Eighty sequencing ‘first-comers’

of the 99 sybodies were further screened by a convenient fluorescence-detector size
exclusion chromatography (FSEC) assay using crude extract from sybody-expressing
clones. This identified 28 (36%) sybodies, including 9 Concave (21%), 9 Loop (50%),
and 10 Convex (56%) binders that caused earlier retention of the fluorescein-labeled
RBD (Extended Data Fig. 2A, Extended Data Table 1).

The same 80 sybodies were also screened for neutralization activity against

retroviral pseudotypes harboring the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Using 50% neutralization

at 1 M concentration as a cut-off, 11 Concave (26%), 13 Loop (68%), and 10 Convex
(56%) sybodies were identified as positive (Extended Data Fig. 3A). The high positive
rates suggest high efficiency of the in vitro selection platform. Of note, none of the
sybodies showed noticeable neutralization activities for the closely related SARS-CoV
pseudovirus (Extended Data Fig. 3B), indicating high specificity.

Six FSEC-positive neutralizing sybodies, namely SR4 (1), MR3 (31), MR4 (9), MR17
(1), LR1 (31), and LR5 (19) (S, M, L refers to Concave, Loop, and Convex sybodies
respectively; brackets indicate ELISA redundancy), were characterized in more detail
as follows. They could be purified from Escherichia coli with high yield (Fig. 1A), formed
complexes with RBD on gel filtration (Extended Data Fig. 2B), displayed ultra-high
thermostability (Fig. 1A, Extended Data Fig. 2C) as originally designed 26, and bound
to the RBD with relatively high affinity (Fig. 1A, Extended Data Fig. 4), with KD ranging
from 83.7 nM (MR17) to 1.0 nM (MR3). Consistent with its highest affinity, MR3
showed the slowest off-rate (2.3 × 10-4 s-1). Using neutralization assays, we determined
IC50 of the six sybodies (Fig. 1B). MR3 was the most potent (IC50 of 0.40 g mL-1),
indicating a largely consistent trend between neutralization potency and binding
kinetics (affinity and off-rate).

To gain mechanistic insights into neutralization, we performed crystallization

structure determination (Extended Data Table 2). Crystals for MR3- and MR4-RBD did
not diffract beyond 8.0 Å despite our optimization efforts.

The RBD structure resembles a short backrest high chair and SR4 binds to both

electrostatic complementarity (Extended Data Fig. 5A). Of note, SR4 binds sideways,
as intended by design of the Concave sybody library26. All three CDRs contributed to

the binding through hydrophobic interactions and H-bonding that involves both side
chains and main chains (Fig. 1D). In addition, Tyr37, a framework residue, also

MR17 also binds to the RBD at the ‘seat’ and ‘backrest’ regions but approaches
the RBD at an almost perfect opposite direction of SR4 (Fig. 1C, 1E), indicating
divergent binding mode for these sybodies. The binding of MR17 to the RBD occurred
on an 853.94 Å 2 surface area with noticeable electrostatic complementarity (Extended
Data Fig. 5B). Interestingly, this surface was largely shared with the SR4 binding surface
(Fig. 1F). The interactions between MR17 and the RBD were mainly mediated by Hbonding. Apart from the three CDRs, two framework residues, Lys65 and Tyr60,
interacted with the same RBD residue Glu484, via a salt bridge with its side chain, and
an H-bond with its main chain (Fig. 1G).

Molecular mechanism for neutralization
Structure alignment of SR4-, MR17- and ACE2-RBD4 showed that both sybodies
engage with RBD at the receptor-binding motif (RBM) (Fig. 2A, 2B). Superposing SR4
and MR17 to the S trimer showed both sybodies could bind to the ‘up’ conformation 2
of RBD with no steric clashes (Fig. 2C, 2D), and to the ‘down’ conformation with only
minor clashes (Extended Data Fig. 6) owing to their minute sizes. Consistent with the
structure observation, both SR4 and MR17 inhibited the binding of ACE2 to RBD, as
revealed by bio-layer interferometry (BLI) assays (Fig. 2E, 2F).

165

167

To probe the epitope for MR3 without a structure, competitive BLI binding assays
were carried out. The results showed that MR3 could block ACE2 (Fig. 2G), and SR4

168

and MR17 (Fig. 2H, 2I), suggesting it also binds to at least part of the RBM, although

169

the possibility of allosteric inhibition remains to be investigated. Taken together, SR4
and MR17, and probably MR3, neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by competitively blocking the
ACE2-RBD binding.

Increasing valency is a common technique to enhance potency for
nanobodies18,31. To this end, we engineered three types of divalent sybodies, including
the biparatopic fusion of two different sybodies, the Fc-fusion and direct fusion of the
same sybody.

208

For biparatopic fusion, we first identified two sybodies, namely LR1 and LR5 (Fig.

209

3A, 3B), that could bind RBD in addition to MR3 using the BLI assay. As LR5 showed
higher affinity and neutralization activity than LR1 (Fig. 1A), we fused this noncompeting sybody to the N-terminal of MR3 with various length of GS linkers ranging
from 13 to 34 amino acids (Extended Data Table S1). Interestingly, the linker length
had little effect on neutralization activity and these biparatopic LR5-MR3 sybodies
were more potent than either sybodies alone (Fig. 1A) with an IC50 of 0.11 g mL-1 (Fig.
3C). LR5-MR3 may be more tolerant to escape mutants34-37 owing to its ability to
recognize two distinct epitopes.

mL-1), respectively (Fig. 3D, 3E). Consistently, the Fc fusion increased the apparent
binding affinity for both sybodies, with a KD of 0.22 nM for Fc-MR3 and less than 1 pM
for Fc-MR17 (Extended Data Fig. 4H, 4I). Note, however, Fc-MR17 did not gain as much
neutralization potency as for the apparent binding affinity.

For direct fusion, MR3 and a rationally designed MR17 mutant (MR17m,
Extended Data Fig. 7) that showed comparable IC50 with MR3 by a single mutation
K99Y (0.50 g mL-1, Extended Data Fig. 7G) were individually linked together via GS
linkers with variable length ranging from 13 to 34 amino acids (Extended Data Table
1). The optimal construct for MR17m-MR17m had the shortest linker (13-GS) (Fig. 3D,
3E). By contrast, optimal neutralization activity was observed with the longest linker
(34-GS) for MR3-MR3 (Fig. 3D, 3E). Again, MR3-MR3 was superior compared to
MR17m-MR17m, showing a 2-fold higher neutralization activity with an IC50 of 12 ng
mL-1 (Fig. 3E). Compared to the monovalent MR3 (IC50 of 0.40 g mL-1), the divalent
engineering increased the potency by over 30 folds. Notably, MR3-MR3 showed similar
activity to inhibit pseudotypes harboring the original SARS-CoV-2 S or the current
dominant and more infectious mutant D614G S (ref. 33) (Fig. 3D).

The most potent divalent sybody (MR3-MR3) was chosen to investigate the
potential of nanobodies to protect mice from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nanobodies have
very short serum half-lives of several minutes due to their minute size38. To circumvent
this, we fused MR3-MR3 to the N-terminus of an albumin-binding domain (ABD)39
which has been known to extend the circulating half-life of its fusion partners by
increase in size and preventing intracellular degradation31. Conveniently, we expressed
MR3-MR3-ABD in Pichia pastoris, which is the preferred host to express nanobody
therapeutics owing to its robustness and its endotoxin-free production. Small-scale
expression of MR3-MR3-ABD showed a secretion level of ~250 mg L-1 with an apparent
purity of >80% without purification (Fig. 4A). Note, this experiment was carried out
using a shaker which gave cell density of OD600 of 16. Given its ability to grow to OD600
of 500 without compromising yield, the expression level of MR3-MR3-ABD may reach
7.5 g L-1 in fermenters. The potential for simple and high-yield production is especially
attractive for the pandemic at a global scale.

254

256

Importantly, MR3-MR3-ABD could bind to the human albumin (Fig. 4B) while
retaining its ability to bind RBD (Fig. 4C) and to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes

257

harboring either past (614D) and current (614G)33 SARS-CoV-2 S (Fig. 4D). As designed,

a serum virus neutralization assay showed that the addition of the albumin binding
domain to the divalent MR3 (MR3-MR3-ABD) extended its in vivo stability, displaying
neutralization activity up to 24 h post injection contrary to the other forms (Extended
Data Fig. 8A). The body weight measures, and the microscopic histopathology analysis
did not reveal any toxicity for the nanobodies for 6 days (Extended Data Fig. 8B, 8C).

To test the in vivo antiviral efficacy of MR3-MR3-ABD, C57BL/6J female mice, aged
6-8 weeks old, were first sensitized to SARS-CoV-2 infection using an adenovirus
expressing the human ACE2 receptor40 at 5 days before challenge. Mice were infected
via the intranasal route with 5 x 106 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of
SARS-CoV-2, and then administered a single dose of 25 mg kg-1 MR3-MR3-ABD via the
intraperitoneal route at 12 h after virus challenge. A control C57BL/6J group were
given PBS as a mock treatment. Compared to the control group, the lung viral titers of
the sybody group was 50-fold lower than the PBS group, when assessed at 3 dpi (Fig.
4E). This efficacy is similar to the existing human monoclonal antibody CB6 (2
injections, 50-fold, in rhesus macaques)41 and better than that for 1B07 (1 injection,
10-fold, mice)42 when compared under similar sampling points.

Histopathological examination revealed that the infected mice in the PBS-treated
group displayed moderate bronchopneumonia lesions, with a large number of
inflammatory cell infiltrations around the bronchioles and terminal bronchioles. The
alveolar walls were thickened, a large number of inflammatory cells were exuded in
the interstitium, accompanied by red blood cell exudation. In addition, part of the
alveolar cavity showed compensatory expansion (Fig. 4F). In contrast, the lungs of
sybody-treated mice showed normal alveolar wall structures, and only displayed mild
bronchopneumonia, with a small amount of inflammatory cell infiltration around the
bronchioles (Fig. 4F). Taken together, the significant reduction of the lung viral load
and the severity of lung damage demonstrated the in vivo efficacy of the MR3-MR3-

286

ABD against authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In summary, the in vitro platform was efficient in generating neutralizing sybodies
(the selection process took 2 weeks). Structural and biochemical studies suggested an
antagonistic mechanism to block the ACE2-RBD interaction. Protein engineering
yielded various forms of sybody with higher affinity, neutralization activity, and in vivo
stability. Using the most potent construct, we have in the first time demonstrated that
nanobodies can provide post-exposure protection of mice from SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Our results should encourage development of nanobody therapeutics to fight COVID19 or future viral outbreaks.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein expression and purification

– SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD for sybody selection

The construct for the RBD with an Avi-tag for biotinylation was made by fusing
DNA, from 5’- to 3’-end, of the encoding sequence for the honey bee melittin signal
peptide (KFLVNVALVFMVVYISYIYAA), a Gly-Ser linker, residues of 330-541 of the SARSCoV-2 spike protein (Uniprot P0DTC2), a Gly-Thr linker, the 3C protease site
(LEVLFQGP), a Gly-Ser linker, the Avi tag (GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE), a Ser-Gly linker, and a
deca-His tag, into a pFastBac-backbone vector by Gibson assembly43. Baculoviruses
were generated using standard Bac-to-Bac protocols and expression was achieved by
infecting Trichoplusia ni High Five suspension cells at 2  106 cells per milliliter for 4860 h at 27 °C in flasks. The medium from 1 L of culture was filtered through a 0.22-m
membrane and incubated with 3.0 mL of Ni-Sepharose Excel (Cat 17-3712-03, GE
Healthcare) in the presence of 20 mM of imidazole for 2-3 h at 4 °C with mild agitation.
The beads were washed with 10 column volume (CV) of 20 mM imidazole in Buffer A
(150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0). The RBD was eluted using 300 mM of imidazole
in Buffer A. For biotinylation26,27, the purified RBD with the Avi-tag intact (0.8 mg mL1) was incubated with 5 mM ATP, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 43.5 μM biotin, 22 g
mL-1 home-purified BirA in 3.2 mL volume and incubated at 4 °C for 16 h. Biotinylated
RBD was concentrated using a 10-kDa cut-off membrane concentrator to ~3 mg mL-1
before loaded onto a Superdex Increase 200 10/300 GL column for size exclusion
chromatography. Fractions containing the RBD were pooled, aliquoted, flash-frozen in
liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C before use.

– SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD for crystallization

Ni-Sepharose Excel column was desalted to remove imidazole using a desalting column
(Cat. 732-2010, Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated in Buffer A. The desalted RBD was mixed
with home-purified His-tagged 3C protease at 1:100 molar ratio (3C protease : RBD) at
4 °C for 16 h. The mixture was then passed through a Ni-NTA column which binds 3C
protease, undigested RBD, and the cleaved His-tag. The flow-through fractions were
collected and concentrated to 8-10 mg mL-1. The protein was either used directly for
crystallization, or flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C before use.

385

387

For crystallization, fresh RBD or thawed from -80 °C was mixed with desired
sybodies at 1:1.5 molar ratio (RBD:sybody). After incubation on ice for 30 min, the

388

mixture was clarified by centrifugation before size exclusion chromatography.

Protein expression and purification
– sybodies in Escherichia coli
Sybodies were expressed with a C-terminally His-tag in Escherichia coli MC1061
cells. Briefly, cells carrying sybody genes in the vector pSb-init26,27 were grown in
Terrific Broth (TB, 0.17 M KH2PO4 and 0.72 M K2HPO4, 1.2 %(w/v) tryptone, 2.4 %(w/v)
yeast extract, 0.5% (v/v) glycerol) supplemented with 25 mg L-1 chloramphenicol to
OD600 of 0.5 at 37 °C in a shaker-incubator at 220 rpm. The growth temperature was
lowered to 22 °C and the cells were allowed to grow for another 1.5 h before induced
with 0.02% (w/v) arabinose for 17 h. Cells were lysed by osmotic shock. Briefly, cells
from 1 L of culture were re-suspended in 20 mL of TES-high Buffer (0.5 M sucrose, 0.5
mM EDTA, and 0.2 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. After this
dehydration step, cells were abruptly rehydrated with 40 mL of ice-cold MilliQ H2O at
4 °C for 1 h. The periplasmic extract released by the osmotic shock was collected by
centrifugation at 20,000g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was adjusted to contain
150 mM of NaCl, 2 mM of MgCl2, and 20 mM of imidazole before added with Ni-NTA
resin that had been pre-equilibrated with 20 mM of imidazole in Buffer A (150 mM
NaCl and 20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0). After batch-binding for 2 h, the beads were washed
with 30 mM imidazole, before eluted with 300 mM imidazole in Buffer A. The eluted
protein was either used directly or flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C.

Protein expression
- sybody MR3-MR3-ABD in Pichia pastoris
The encoding gene for MR3-MR3-ABD (Table S1) was cloned into vector pPICZC
(Invitrogen) immediately in frame with the -factor signal peptide. To express MR3MR3-ABD in yeast, Pichia pastoris GS115 and SMD1168H were transformed with SacIlinearized plasmid and selected with 0.1 and 0.5 mg mL-1 zeocin on an YPDS agar plate
(1 %(w/v) yeast extract, 2 %(w/v) peptone, 2 %(w/v) glucose, 0.8 M sorbitol, 2 %(w/v)
agarose). Colonies (12 for each strain) were inoculated into 3 mL YPD liquid medium.
Cells were grown in a 30-°C incubator. After 24 h, cells were harvested, washed twice
with methanol-complex medium (BMMY), and suspended in BMMY medium at a final
OD600 of 4-5 for induction. Methanol was supplemented to the medium to 0.5 %(v/v)
every 24 h. After 3 days of expression, the medium was collected by centrifugation and
the secreted protein was used for SDS-PAGE analysis.

Protein expression and purification
– divalent sybodies in mammalian cells
The encoding sequence of MR3 was cloned into a vector harboring the hinge and
Fc regions of IgG2 (Table S1, uniprot P01859) for secretion in mammalian cells. Expi293
cells at density of 2.3 million per milliliter were transfected with the plasmid (final
concentration of 2 mg L-1) using linear polyethylenimine (average MW of 25 kDa, 4 mg

440

L-1). Valproic acid was included at a final concentration of 2 mM. Cells were cultured in
a flask for 65 h. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation and filtered through
a 0.22-m membrane. The filtrate from 2 L of culture was incubated with 3.2 mL
rProtein A beads (Cat SA012005, SmartLifesciences, China) for batch binding at 4 °C for
3 h. The beads were packed into a gravity column, washed with 20 CV of PBS buffer,
before eluted with 0.1 M glycine pH 3.0. The elution was quickly neutralized using 1 M

performed according to the manufacturer’s instruction (PUREfrex 2.1 kit, Cat. PF2130.25-EX, Genefrontier, Chiba, Japan). A reaction mix containing 1.8 μL of nuclease-free
water, 4 μL of solution I, 0.5 μL of solution II, 1 μL of solution III, 0.5 μL of 10 mM
cysteine, 0.5 μL of 80 mM reduced glutathione, 0.5 μL of 60 mM oxidized glutathione,
and 0.5 μL of 1.875 mg mL-1 disulfide bond isomerase DsbC (DS supplement, Cat.

Panning Solution (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM magnesium acetate, 0.05 %(w/v) BSA,
0.1 %(w/v) Tween 20, 0.5 %(w/v) heparin, 1 μL RNaseIn, and 50 mM Tris-acetate pH

added to the supernatant and the mixture was incubated on ice for 20 min.
Streptavidin beads (Dynabeads Myone Streptavidin T1) were added to pull-down the

Three rounds of phage display were carried out. The first round was performed
in a 96-well plate coated with 60 nM neutravidin (Cat. 31000, Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Phage particles were incubated with 50 nM biotinylated RBD, washed, and released
from the plate by tryptic digestion with 0.25 mg mL-1 trypsin in the buffer containing
150 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4. The selected phage particles were amplified,
and the second round of selection was performed by switching the immobilizing
matrix to 12 μL of MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads that were pre-incubated with 50 nM
biotinylated RBD. Before releasing the phage particles, the binders were challenged
with 5 M non-biotinylated RBD to compete off the binders with fast off-rates. The
second selection was repeated with 5 nM of the RBD. After three rounds of selection,
the phagemid was sub-cloned into pSb_init vector by fragment-exchange (FX) cloning
and transformed into E. coli MC1061 for further screening at a single-colony level26,27.

resuspended in TES Buffer (20 % (w/v) sucrose, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 g/mL lysozyme, 50

blocked by 0.5 %(w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS buffer for 30 min at RT. The
plate was washed three times using TBS before added with anti-myc antibodies at
1:2,000 dilution in TBS-BSA-T buffer (TBS supplemented with 0.5 %(w/v) BSA and
0.05 %(v/v) Tween 20). The antibody was allowed to bind to protein A for 20 min at RT.
The plate was then washed three times with TBST (TBS supplemented with 0.05%
Tween 20). Myc-tagged sybody prepared above was added and incubated for 20 min
at RT. After washing three times with TBST, biotinylated RBD or MBP (the maltosebinding protein, as a control) was added to each well to a final concentration of 50 nM.

514

After incubation for 20 min at RT, the solution was discarded and the plate was rinsed
three times with TBST. Streptavidin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was
added to each well (1:5,000, Cat S2438, Sigma). After incubation at RT for 30 min, the
plate was washed three times again with TBST. ELISA signal (absorbance at 650 nm)
was developed by adding 100 L of developing buffer (51 mM Na2HPO4, 24 mM citric

Sybody selection

To rapidly characterize RBD binders without purification, we have developed an
analytic, fluorescence-detection size exclusion chromatography (FSEC)-based assay as
follows. Biotinylated RBDavi was bound to streptavidin (Cat 16955, AAT Bioquest) which
was fluorescently labeled by fluorescein via amine coupling. The complex is named as
FL-RBDavi. To 0.5 M of FL-RBDavi, cell lysate containing unpurified sybodies were
added to an estimated concentration of 0.019 mg mL-1, assuming expression level of
20 mg L-1. The mixture was loaded onto an analytic gel filtration column (Cat 9F16206,
Sepax) connected to an HPLC system equipped with a fluorescence detector (RF-20A,
Shimadzu). The profile was monitored by fluorescence at the excitation/emission pair

Binders can be identified based on earlier retention volume, presumably reflecting the
bigger size of the FL-RBDavi-sybody complex than the FL-RBDavi alone.

with sybodies at various concentrations (association) for 120 s (for MR3) or 300 s (for
all the others). The concentrations for SR4 are 0, 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 nM. The
concentrations for MR17 are 0, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 nM. The concentrations for
MR3/MR4 are 0, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 nM. The sensor was then moved into sybodyfree buffer for dissociation and the signal was monitored for 600 s. Data were fitted
for a 1:1 stoichiometry for KD, Kon, and Koff calculations using the built-in software Data
Analysis 10.0.

For competition binding of the RBD between sybody and ACE2 (Cat 10108-H08B,
Sino Biological), the RBD was immobilized and the sensor was equilibrated as
abovementioned. The sensor was then saturated using 1 M sybody and the system
was equilibrated for 180 s. After saturation, the sensor was moved into sybody
solutions (50 nM) with or without 25 nM ACE2. The association of ACE2 was monitored
for 600 s. As a control, the ACE2-RBD interaction was monitored using sensors without
sybody incubation.

Crystallization trials were set up using a Crystal Gryphon LCP robot as follows. To
a two-well sitting-drop plate, 70 L of precipitant solution was added to the reservoir.
To each well, 150 nL of protein solution was added using the LCP arm of the robot. The
wells were covered with 150 nL of precipitant solution using the 96-headed tips. Plates
were sealed using a tape (Cat HR4-506, Hampton research) and placed at 20 °C in a

Data collection and structure determination
X-ray diffraction data were collected at beamline BL19U1 (ref.45) at Shanghai
Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Diffraction data were collected with a 50 x 50 μm beam
on a Pilatus detector at a distance of 300 – 500 mm, with oscillation of 0.5 - 1° and a
wavelength of 0.97853 Å. Data were integrated using XDS 46, and scaled and merged
using Aimless 47. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using Phaser 48
with the RBD structure from PDB 6M0J and the sybody from PDB 5M13 26 as the search
model. The model was built with 2Fo-Fc maps in Coot 49, and refined using Phenix 50.
Structures were visualized using PyMol 51.

Structure-based design of sybody mutants to improve binding affinity
The structure of the MR17-RBD complex was examined using Coot49 and PyMol51.
A panel of 19 single mutants was designed by virtual mutation using Coot 49 followed
by examining the possible increasing in numbers of H-bonds, salt bridges, or
hydrophobic interactions. The mutations include V31F, V31I, E35F, G47A, G47F, G47W,
E52F, E52M, E52Q, S53k, S53Q, H56F, H56I, H56W, H56Y, K99Y, Q103D, Q103E, and
Q103Y. The mutants were purified and characterized the same way as for MR17.
Because K99Y showed higher neutralization activity than the wild-type, K99W was
designed for the second round.

In vivo stability of sybody in mice

632

The female 7-week-old ICR mice weighing 27 ± 1 g were intraperitoneally injected
with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or sybodies MR3, MR3-MR3, or MR3-MR3-ABD
at 25mg kg-1 in a final volume of 100 L in PBS. The blood samples were collected at
different time points (2 days preinjection, 6 h, 12h, 1 day, 3 days, 6 days and 14 days
postinjection) and subjected to neutralization assay using SARS-CoV-2 pseudotypes.
Mice weights were measured till 6 days post-injection (n=4). Mice were sacrificed at 1,
3, and 6 days post-injection; their vital organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney and
thymus) were fixed in 4% formaldehyde at 4 °C overnight and then embedded within

aFluorescence-detection

size exclusion chromatography (FSEC) assay for RBD binders.
Periplasmic extraction was directly mixed with 0.5 M of fluorescently labeled RBD
and the mixture was loaded onto an analytic gel filtration column. Sybodies that
caused earlier retention volume (peak shift) are labeled ‘Y’ and colored red. Sybodies
that did not peak shift are indicated with ‘N’. Sybodies that were not determined for
FSEC peak-shift are labeled with ‘N.D.’. bThe sequences include ‘GSSS’ at the N-terminal,
and ‘AGRAGEQKLISEEDLNSAVDHHHHHH’ at the C-terminal which contains a myc-tag
(italic) for ELISA and a hexahistidine tag for purification. GS linker are highlighted in
italic, when applicable.

Extended Data Fig. 2. Characterization and purification of sybody-RBD complexes. (A)
Fluorescence-detector size exclusion chromatography (FSEC) of the RBD in the absence
(black, -) and presence (red, +) of crude periplasmic extract from sybody clones.
Biotinylated RBD was fluorescently labeled through binding to streptavidin that was
conjugated with an amine-reactive fluorescein variant. The concentration of RBD was
0.5 M. Fluorescence (Ex. 482 nm, Em. 508 nm) was normalized before plotting. The
extent of peak shift follows the order of SR4<MR4<MR17<MR3. Fluorescence trace

before the void volume (Vo, 1.78 mL) is not shown. (B) Preparative size exclusion
chromatography of the indicated sybody-RBD complexes. SDS-PAGE images of the
main-peak fraction for all four sybodies are shown in the inset. Numbers label the
elution volume for the main peak. The results for SR34, SR38, MR6, LR1, and LR5 were
similar to the 4 sybodies here and are not shown. (C) Fluorescence-detection size
exclusion chromatography (FSEC) profile of the thermostability assay. Sybodies SR4,
MR17, MR3, and MR4 were incubated at indicated temperatures for 20 min before
loading on to an analytical size exclusion chromatography column. The elution profile
was monitored using the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Fluorescence intensities

714

were normalized to the peak value of the unheated sample.

improved affinity and potency. (A,B) Neutralization assay for SARS-CoV-2 (A) or SARSCoV (B) pseudotypes by the wild-type MR17 sybody and the 20 rationally designed
single-mutants (See Methods). Sybody concentrations were used at 1 M (green) and
100 nM (magenta) concentrations. Data are from three independent experiments.

(C,D) Rational for the design of K99Y. The positively charged Lys99 pokes to an area
(boxed) that contains a hydrophobic patch (red cycle) and a positively-charged surface
(cyan cycle). Electrostatic repel and hydrophobic mismatch would make Lys99
unfavorable at this position. According to the original library design, Lys99 was
unvaried26, meaning that Lys99 was not selected and hence opportunities for
optimization. (E) The K99Y mutation fits the hydrophobic microenvironment well, as
revealed by the crystal structure of MR17m (Extended Data Table 2). (F) Binding
kinetics of MR17m binding to RBD. BLI signals were recorded under indicated MR17m
concentrations (nM). (G) Comparison of neutralization activity of MR17 and MR17m.
