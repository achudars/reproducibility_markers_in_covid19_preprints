Abstract

25

Understanding antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 is indispensable for the development of

26

containment measures to overcome the current COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we determine the

27

ability of sera from 101 recovered healthcare workers to neutralize both authentic SARS-CoV-2

28

and SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus and address their antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2

29

nucleoprotein and spike receptor-binding domain. Interestingly, the majority of individuals have

30

low neutralization capacity and only 6% of the healthcare workers showed high neutralizing titers

31

against both authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus and the pseudotyped virus. We found the antibody

32

response to SARS-CoV-2 infection generates antigen-specific isotypes as well as a diverse

33

combination of antibody isotypes, with high titers of IgG, IgM and IgA against both antigens

34

correlating with neutralization capacity. Importantly, we found that neutralization correlated with

35

antibody titers as quantified by ELISA. This suggests that an ELISA assay can be used to

36

determine seroneutralization potential. Altogether, our work provides a snapshot of the SARS-

37

CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response in recovered healthcare workers and provides evidence that

38

possessing multiple antibody isotypes may play an important role in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.

Introduction

48

The novel coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-

49

2), has rapidly spread across the globe, leading to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),

50

devastating mortality, and significant impacts on our way of life. One question that still remains is

51

whether those infected by SARS-CoV-2 generate an immune response that will protect them from

52

reinfection1. Moreover, this question is particularly important for the development of a SARS-

53

CoV-2 vaccine, as an effective vaccine would need to generate a potent neutralizing antibody

54

response and immunological memory to provide long-lasting protection2,3. Thus, it is essential that

55

we carefully study and document the neutralizing antibody responses in recovered individuals.

56

SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing is critical to understanding who has been infected and to

57

provide a picture of seroprevalence in a community4-9. However, while these tests are important

58

and provide a relative antibody titer, they are seen more as a “yes or no” type of answer to whether

59

an individual has been infected. Importantly, these tests do not provide information on whether the

60

SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies present in serum are protective, including through virus

61

neutralization, and as such, a positive antibody test may give individuals a false sense of

62

“immunity” to the virus.

63

A number of studies have begun to unravel the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 beyond

64

a simple “yes or no” answer 9-18. Here, we hypothesized that by examining the antibody profile in

65

patient’s serum in terms of antigens, antibody isotypes (IgG, IgM, and IgA), and neutralization,

66

we would be able to identify specific signatures associated to effective SARS-CoV-2

67

neutralization. In this study, we obtained convalescent serum from 101 SARS-CoV-2 PCR-

68

positive healthcare workers and performed a comprehensive analysis of neutralization of authentic

69

SARS-CoV-2 and a pseudotyped lentivirus as well as serum IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody titers to

the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the nucleoprotein (N) (Fig. 1a).

Together, this study provides an in-depth look into the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody

response in recovered individuals and highlights the role of multiple antibody isotypes in the

73

development of a potent neutralizing antibody response.

Methods

76

Serum samples. Serum was collected from 101 healthcare workers from NYU Langone who had

77

laboratory evidence of COVID-19 (PCR-positive) and were at least 21-28 days post symptoms or

78

PCR test. Healthy control sera were collected from patients through the NYU Vaccine Center. All

79

patients gave written consent and all samples were deidentified for this study under IRB #i20-

80

00595 (SARS-CoV-2 infected) and IRB #s18-02037 (healthy controls).

81

Plasmids For pseudotyped virus generation: To construct the SARS-CoV-2 SD19 expression

82

vector pcCOV2-D19.S, a codon-optimized DNA sequence was synthesized encoding the SARS-

83

CoV-2 Spike (Wuhan-Hu-1/2019). An amplicon was amplified encoding the S protein with a 19

84

amino acid truncation of the cytoplasmic tail using primers containing flanking 5’-KpnI and 3’-

85

XhoI sites and cloned into pcDNA6 (Invitrogen, Inc.). To construct the ACE2 expression vector

86

pLenti.ACE2-HA, the ACE2 coding sequence was amplified from an ACE2 cDNA (Origene Inc)

87

using primers with flanking 5’-XbaI and 3’-SalI sites and cloned into pLenti.CMV.GFP.puro. For

88

RBD ELISA: The nucleotide sequence of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (residues

89

328-531) was obtained from a GenBank entry MN908947.3. A codon-optimized gene encoding

90

the RBD with a hexa-histidine tag (His6-tag) and biotinylation tag (Avi-tag) at the C terminus was

91

synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies) and cloned into the pBCAG mammalian expression

92

vector.

93

Cells and virus. Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified

94

Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Corning) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Atlanta

95

Biologics) and 1% nonessential amino acids (NEAA, Corning). Human embryonic kidney (HEK)

96

293T cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, and 1%

97

penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). To generate 293T stably expressing ACE2 (ACE2-293T cells),

98

293T cells were transfected with pLenti.ACE2-HA DNA by lipofection with lipofectamine 2000

99

(Invitrogen). After 2 days, the cells were selected in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1%

100

P/S, and 1 µg/ml of puromycin. Single cell clones were expanded and analyzed by flow cytometry

101

for ACE2 expression and a single clone was chosen for subsequent use. Expi293T cells (Thermo

102

Fisher) were maintained in Expi293 Expression Medium (Thermo Fisher). All cells were

103

maintained at 37oC with 5% CO2 and confirmed mycoplasma free.

104

SARS-CoV-2, isolate USA-WA1/202019 (BEI resources # NR52281, a gift from Dr. Mark

105

Mulligan at the NYU Langone Vaccine Center) was amplified once in Vero E6 cells (P1 from the

106

original BEI stock). Briefly, 90-95% confluent T175 flask (Thomas Scientific) of Vero E6 (1x107

107

cells) was infected with 10 μL of the BEI stock in 3 mL of infection media (DMEM, 2% FBS, 1%

108

NEAA, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.0) for 1 hour. After 1 hour, 15 ml of infection media was added

109

to the inoculum and cells were incubated 72 hrs at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After 72 hrs, the supernatant

110

was collected and the monolayer was frozen and thawed once. Both supernatant and cellular

111

fractions were combined, centrifuged for 5 min at 1200 rpm, and filtered using a 0.22 μm Steriflip

112

(Millipore). Viral titers were determined by plaque assay in Vero E6 cells. In brief, 220,000 Vero

113

E6 cells/well were seeded in a 24 well plate, 24 hrs before infection. Ten-fold dilutions of the virus

114

in DMEM were added to the Vero E6 monolayers for 1 hour at 37 °C. Following incubation, cells

115

were overlaid with 0.8% agarose in DMEM containing 2% FBS and incubated at 37 °C for 72 hrs.

116

The cells were fixed with 10% formalin, the agarose plug removed, and plaques visualized by

117

crystal violet staining. All experiments with authentic SARS-CoV-2 were conducted in the NYU

118

Grossman School of Medicine ABSL3 facility.

119

Pseudotyped virus preparation. Pseudotyped virus was produced by calcium phosphate

120

cotransfection of 293T cells with pMDL, plenti.GFP-NLuc, pcSARS-CoV-2-SD19 and pcRev at a

121

ratio of 4:3:4:1. The supernatant was harvested 2 days post-transfection, passed through an 0.22

122

µm filter and then pelleted by ultracentrifugation for 90 min at 30,000 rpm in an SW40.1 rotor.

123

The pellet was resuspended in 1/10th the original volume of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS

124

and frozen at -80°C in aliquots.

125

SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. Vero E6 cells (30,400 cells/well) were seeded in a 96 well

126

plate 24 hrs before infection so that a monolayer was present the following day. Serum samples

127

from COVID-19 convalescent individuals and healthy donors were two-fold serially diluted

128

(spanning from 1:10 to 1:10,240) in DMEM (Corning), 1% NEAA (Corning) and 10 mM HEPES

129

(Gibco). Diluted serum samples were mixed 1:1 (vol/vol) with SARS-CoV-2 virus (6.8 x 103

130

PFU/ml), and incubated 1 h at 37 °C. During the incubation period, Vero E6 monolayers were

131

washed once with DMEM (Corning) to remove any serum present in the media that could interfere

132

with the assay. After incubation, 100 μl of the serum:SARS-CoV-2 mixtures were added to the

133

Vero E6 monolayers, and cells were incubated at 37°C. Cells were monitored every day for

134

cytopathic effects (CPE) induced by viral infection, and at 5 days post infection cells were fixed

135

in 10% formalin solution (Fisher Scientific) for 1 hr. Cells were then stained by adding 50 µl

136

crystal violet/well and incubated for 30 min. Each well was scored as “0” if there was no monolayer

137

left, “0.5” if there was some monolayer and the well was clearly infected, or “1” if the monolayer

138

was intact. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the minimal serum

dilution in which the cell monolayer was intact (score = 1). Each serum sample was measured in

140

technical duplicates.

141

Pseudotype virus neutralization assay. To determine neutralizing serum titers, ACE2-293T cells

142

were plated in 96 well tissue culture dishes at 10,000 cells/well. The following day, 2-fold dilutions

143

of the donor sera were made in culture medium spanning a range from 1:10 to 1:10240. Each

144

dilution (50 μl) was mixed with 5 μl SARS-CoV-2 SΔ19 lentiviral pseudotype. The mixtures were

145

incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then added to the plated ACE-2 293T cells. The

146

plates were cultured for two days at 37°C with 5% CO2 after which the supernatant was removed

147

and replaced with 50 μl Nano-Glo Luciferase Substrate (Promega, Inc.). Light emission was

148

measured in an Envision 2103 Multi-label plate reader (PerkinElmer, Inc.).

149

SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein ELISA. Serum IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2

150

nucleoprotein were tested using the SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA and IgM ELISA kits manufactured by

151

Virotech Diagnostics GmbH for Gold Standard Diagnostics (Davis, CA) following the

152

manufacturer’s instructions. For the detection of IgG and IgA, serum samples were diluted 1:100

153

in dilution buffer and for IgM, serum samples were diluted 1:101 in RF-Adsorption dilution buffer

154

mixture and incubated at room temperature for 15 min before being added to the wells. Results are

155

reported qualitatively as negative (<9.0 units), equivocal (9.0-11.0 units), and positive (>11.0

156

units).

162

inhibitors and clarified by further centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 20 min and filtration through a

163

0.22 µm filter. The supernatants were dialyzed into 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.4 with 500

164

mM sodium chloride and the recombinant RBD was purified by immobilized metal ion affinity

165

chromatography (IMAC) using a HisTrap excel column (GE Healthcare). The purified protein was

166

biotinylated using the E. coli BirA enzyme produced in house in the presence of 10 mM ATP and

167

0.5 mM biotin. The RBD protein was purified by IMAC and dialyzed against PBS and stored at -

168

80 °C. High purity of the purified protein was confirmed using SDS-PAGE, and analysis by size

169

exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare), which

170

showed a single, monodisperse peak consistent with its molecular mass (Extended Data Fig. 1A

171

and B).

172

For the ELISA, the wells of 384-well ELISA plates (NUNC Maxisort cat# 464718) were

173

coated with 15 µl of 4 µg/ml neutravidin (ThermoFisher cat # 31000) for one hour at room

174

temperature (R.T.) in a humidified chamber. The wells were washed with 100 µl PBST (PBS

175

containing 0.1 % Tween 20) (ThermoFisher, cat# BP337-500) three times using a BioTek 405TS

176

plate washer housed in a BSL-2 biosafety cabinet. The wells were blocked with 0.5 % BSA

177

(Gemini Bio cat# 700-100P, skim milk was not used for blocking because milk can contain biotin

178

that would inhibit antigen immobilization) in PBS overnight at 4 °C. After removing the blocking

179

buffer, 15 µl of 20 nM RBD-His6-Avi-biotin in PBS was added to each well using a Mantis

180

dispenser (Formulatrix). The plates were incubated at R.T. in a humidified chamber for 20 min,

181

and the wells were washed with 100 µl PBST three times using the plate washer. The wells were

182

further blocked with 15 µl of 10 µM biotin in 3% skim milk in PBST (Sigma, cat# 1.15363.0500)

183

for ten min at R.T. in order to block unsaturated neutravidin.

184

Serum samples were heat-treated at 56°C for one hour9 and diluted 158-fold in 1% skim

185

milk in PBST and placed in a 96-well polypropylene plate (ThermoFisher, cat # AB-0796), which

186

served as a master plate. The following sample handling was performed using a Hudson SOLO

187

liquid handler housed in a BSL-2 biosafety cabinet. Twelve microliters of diluted serum were

188

transferred per well of an RBD-immobilized 384-well plate after removing the biotin solution. To

189

prepare 500-fold diluted samples, 8.22 µl of the diluent (1 % skim milk in PBST) was first

190

dispensed into a well to which 3.78 µl of diluted serum from the master plate was added. After 2

191

hours of incubation at R.T., the plate was washed with PBST three times using the plate washer.

cat# 109-035-129; and anti-human IgA-HRP: Jackson ImmunoResearch, cat# 109-035-011;

195

x1/5000 diluted in 1 % milk in PBST) was added using the Mantis dispenser and incubated for one

196

hour at R.T. After washing the plate with PBST three times and then with PBS three times, 25 µl

197

of the substrate (SIGMAFAST™ OPD; Sigma P9187-50SET) was added into the wells using the

198

Mantis dispenser. Subsequently, the stop solution (25 µl of 2 M HCl) was added using the Mantis

199

dispenser. The dispenser was programmed in such a way that the reaction in each well was stopped

200

after 10 min. Absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a BioTek Epoch 2 plate reader. All

201

samples were analyzed two independent times to identify outliers. Those yielding inconsistent

202

results in both assays were excluded from analysis (Sample 76 and 86, Extended Data Table 1).

203

Thresholds were determined comparing the 101 SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive samples at two

204

dilutions 1/158 and 1/500 and compared with 43 SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative individuals. The

Results

230

SARS-CoV-2 seroneutralization capacity is low in the majority of individuals.

231

To better understand the human SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response in

232

convalescent patients, we obtained serum from 101 COVID-19-recovered New York City

233

healthcare workers who had experienced symptoms and had tested positive (by PCR testing) for

234

SARS-CoV-2 in March 2020 (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Table 1). To begin, we assessed how

235

well each individual’s serum was able to neutralize both authentic SARS-CoV-2 (isolate USA

236

WA01/2020), and a lentiviral pseudotyped virus bearing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein

237

(pseudotyped virus) in vitro. Pseudotyped viruses are a safe alternative to authentic virus assays20,

238

and can therefore be employed by a greater number of research institutes and clinical laboratories

239

to assess neutralization of convalescent serum. However, several studies have shown differences

240

in sensitivity between neutralization of authentic SARS-CoV-2 and specific pseudotyped

241

viruses21,22. Thus, we set out to determine serum neutralization capacity using both our in-house

242

lentiviral pseudotyped virus and the WA01/2020 strain of SARS-CoV-2.

243

For the neutralization assays performed with authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus we determined

244

the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), calculated as the minimum serum dilution at which

245

serum is fully-protective (Extended Data Table 1). For the neutralization experiments performed

246

with the pseudotyped virus, we used a reporter pseudotyped virus expressing luciferase which

247

allows for the calculation of the IC90 and the midpoint transition (IC50) (Extended Data Fig. 2 and

248

Extended Data Table 1). Using these systems, we found that neutralization of the authentic

249

SARS-CoV-2 and the pseudotyped virus was positively correlated (Fig. 1b, R2 = 0.49, p<0.0001).

250

Moreover, the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response could be broken into three categories

251

(Fig. 1c). Using 1/MIC and 1/IC90 we find the majority of infected individuals (~75%) had a low

11

252

neutralization capacity, roughly 20% of individuals had intermediate neutralization and only a

253

select few (~5-6%) had high neutralization of the authentic virus. When comparing pseudotyped

254

virus to authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization, there was no significant difference in the

255

proportion of individuals assigned as low or intermediate (Fig. 1c). In contrast, there is a significant

256

difference between the percentage of individuals deemed high neutralizers using authentic SARS-

257

CoV-2 versus pseudotyped virus (Fig. 1c and d, p=0.02). These results validate the use of the

258

pseudotyped virus as an efficient alternative to determine the neutralizing potential of serum. But

259

they also suggests that authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus may be better able to detect potent

260

neutralizing serums, which has implications for the selection of donors for passive immunization

261

therapy.

Finally, because samples were collected from individuals at varying times post onset of

263

symptoms, it may be expected that the proportion of highly or moderately neutralizing sera would

264

decrease over time. However, we found that there was no particular pattern in this cohort.

265

Individuals with low, medium, and high neutralizing sera determined using authentic SARS-CoV-

266

2 are found between 32 and 57 days (Fig. 1e). Together, these results show that at the time points

267

we analyzed (32-57 days post symptom onset), serum SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody capacity

268

is low in most recovered individuals.

269

Human SARS-CoV-2 infection generates antigen-specific, multi-isotype antibody response.

270

Given the broad neutralization capacity observed in this cohort, we were interested in

271

examining the antibody profile of each individual. It is not uncommon that antibody responses are

272

skewed toward one or a few viral proteins10,23. If this is the case, using a single antigen may result

273

in a biased test that inadequately detects antibodies produced by convalescent individuals. Thus,

274

we quantified serum antibody IgG, IgA, and IgM titers by ELISA, focusing on antibodies

275

generated to two SARS-CoV-2 antigens (Extended Data Table 1). First, we used the Gold

276

Standard ELISA assay currently deployed at the Tisch Hospital Clinical Labs in New York City

277

which uses the nucleoprotein (N). Second, we developed an in-house ELISA for the SARS-CoV-

278

2 Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) (Extended Data Fig. 1). If antibody titers against Spike

279

RBD and N correlate, this suggests that individuals mount a uniform response to both these

280

antigens. A lack of correlation suggests that individuals mount a skewed response toward one of

281

these antigens preferentially.

282

When we compared the isotype responses to anti-RBD and anti-N directly, we found that

283

IgG correlated the strongest (R2 = 0.51) followed by IgA (R2 = 0.23) and IgM (R2 = 0.21) (Fig.

284

2a-c, left panels). The percentage of IgG and IgM positive individuals, as detected by reactivity

285

against RBD or N, was similar (Fig. 2a and b, right panels). Strikingly, the majority of individuals

286

with positive titers of IgA to the Spike RBD were largely IgA-negative for N (Fig. 2c, left panel).

287

This translated to a significant difference in IgA detection between the Gold Standard test and our

288

in-house ELISA (Fig. 2c, right panel, p = 2 x 10-16), and suggests that the IgA response is largely

289

skewed towards the Spike RBD in comparison to N (Fig. 2c). It is possible that days post symptom

290

onset plays a role in both serum antibody titers and the relative percentage of IgG, IgM and IgA

291

positive people. Within our cohort we observed no relationship between time post symptom onset

292

and antigen-specific antibody isotype titers (Extended Data Fig. 3), even finding IgM present at

293

50 days post infection (Extended Data Fig. 3B). Together these results suggest that the antibody

294

isotype response to SARS-CoV-2 may be antigen-specific, with IgA skewed towards the RBD.

295

SARS-CoV-2 neutralization best correlates with RBD antibody response.

296

To better understand how each antigen-specific antibody isotype correlated with

297

neutralization, we compared the ELISA assay antibody titers with virus neutralization. While all

13

298

anti-RBD isotype titers correlated similarly with the neutralization level of the authentic SARS-

299

CoV-2 (R2 = 0.4786 – 0.5194) (Fig. 3a), we found that pseudotyped virus neutralization correlated

300

best with IgG titers (R2 = 0.4561) compared with IgA (R2 = 0.2556) or IgM (R2 = 0.2391) (Fig.

301

3b). One explanation for these findings may be that there are molecular differences in folding

302

between the RBD of the authentic virus, pseudotyped virus, and purified RBD such that they are

303

recognized differently by antibody isotypes in these assays24,25. Interestingly, with the exception

304

of anti-N IgG antibodies for the authentic virus (R2 = 0.5277; R2 = 0.255), other anti-N isotype

305

titers showed weaker correlations for either the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus or the pseudotyped

306

virus (Extended Data Fig. 4). These data suggest that ELISA methods based on the RBD may

307

benefit from detection of additional isotypes, rendering them better suited as predictors of sera

308

neutralization.

309

Robust SARS-CoV-2 neutralization associates with high-titer, multi-isotype antibody

310

responses.

311

Next, we delineated what separates our highest neutralizers from the remainder of the

312

cohort using the data collected on antigen-specific antibody isotype titers. To do so, we employed

313

a holistic approach and compared the IgG, IgM and IgA titers for both anti-Spike RBD and anti-

314

N antibodies against neutralizations level (Fig. 4a and b). This revealed that the highest overall

315

neutralizers (MIC higher or equal to 1/640) had higher titers of IgG, IgM and IgA raised against

316

both Spike RBD and N (Fig. 4a and b, red bar). The spike protein is the major determinant for

317

virus neutralization and resides on the outside of the viral particle, exposed to the immune

318

recognition. Consequently, we found stronger correlations between Spike-RBD isotypes compared

319

with N isotypes, when comparing each individual’s IgG, IgM or IgA (anti-Spike RBD and N)

320

against each other (Fig. 4c and d). However, in most cases the high neutralizers (red circles) had

14

321

the highest antibody titers for all isotypes (Fig. 4c and 4d). These data suggest that mounting a

322

robust antibody response, consisting of diverse isotypes, leads to efficient neutralization.

323

Recovered individuals have multiple combinations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies.

324

Finally, given that having multiple isotypes associate with higher neutralization, we were

325

interested in understanding the anti-RBD and N antibody signatures present in individuals and how

326

they correlated with neutralization. Therefore, we classified whether the presence or absence of

327

certain antigen-specific antibody isotypes (based on ELISA cutoffs) related to neutralization level.

328

The 101 COVID-19 patients comprised 21 different antibody combinations, or “clusters” (Fig.

329

5a), ranging from being positive for all six antibodies (N/RBD IgG, IgA, IgM) to three individuals

330

who did not have antibodies to neither N or RBD (Fig. 5a and b, Cluster U). We found that 4 out

331

of the 6 healthcare workers with high neutralizing titers (MIC = 1/640 – 1/2560) had sera that

332

tested positive for all three isotypes (IgA, IgG, and IgM) responsive against both Spike RBD and

333

N (Fig. 5b, Cluster A). However, two individuals with high neutralizing titers (#61 and 67)

334

contained a combination of isotypes that were shared with both medium and low neutralizers (Fig.

335

5b, Clusters C and D). Interestingly, Cluster B, which only lacks IgM against the RBD does not

336

have high neutralization compared with Clusters A, C, and D, suggesting that specific antibody

337

combinations and/or titers may be necessary for maximum neutralization. Finally, the majority of

338

individuals had at least IgG and IgA directed against the RBD accompanied by IgG to N (Fig. 5b).

339

Taken together, these results suggest that having IgG alone may not be enough for efficient

340

neutralization, while having multiple isotypes at high titers present in serum leads to more potent

341

SARS-CoV-2 neutralization.

Discussion

345

Understanding the antibody response and potential immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is critical

346

for global public health and the development of efficacious vaccines1,3,26. In this study, we

347

performed a comprehensive analysis of the SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody response in 101

348

convalescent healthcare workers serum samples. We determined the neutralization capacity of the

349

sera using both authentic virus and pseudotyped particles, quantified the titers of three antibody

350

isotypes (IgG, IgM, and IgA) to both the spike receptor-binding domain and the nucleoprotein,

351

and investigated the correlation of neutralization and antibody levels. We found, that the serum

352

SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody capacity was low for the majority of recovered individuals. In

353

extreme cases, we detected no antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD or N in three

354

individuals. These observations are in line with previously published studies and may suggest that

355

those infected do not produce efficient neutralizing antibodies or neutralizing antibodies rapidly

356

wane by the time samples are collected16,27,28,29. Detailed longitudinal studies are beginning to

357

emerge, showing that serum antibody levels are relatively stable or decrease over time30-32. In-line

358

with our results these studies find a positive correlation between IgG titers and

359

neutralization31,32. Further characterization of neutralization at early and late timepoints is

360

necessary to correlate antibody titer stability to viral protection. However, it is essential to keep in

361

mind that, while neutralization titers can be quantified by reliable laboratory assays, we do not

362

know the overall protective capacity of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in patients. Thus, those

363

with low neutralizing capacities in the lab (MIC < 1/80) could be efficiently protected from SARS-

364

CoV-2 reinfection. Detailed studies monitoring initial and possible reinfections along with the

365

antibody response are crucial to understand immunity to SARS-CoV-2.

366

367

To further understand the composition of convalescent sera, we quantified the amounts of IgG,

368

IgA, and IgM targeting the spike protein RBD and N. We found 21 different antibody

369

combinations that did not directly correlate with days post symptom onset, yet did associate with

370

antibody neutralization. Of these combinations, the majority of individuals fell into four distinct

371

clusters comprised of different antigen-specific isotypes. It remains to be elucidated how these

372

clusters are generated and why certain clusters elicit potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralization (Cluster

373

A) and others do not (Cluster B). Since we use a targeted approach focusing on only two antigens

374

and specific epitopes, it is possible that there are other anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies that bind viral

375

particles and impact neutralization33.

376

Interestingly, we found high quantities of IgM present in some individuals from 32 to 50

377

days post symptom onset. These findings are intriguing since IgM antibodies are usually

378

considered as a marker of a recent infection and their circulating titers are thought to decrease as

379

class switching occurs to IgG and IgA. This observation is of importance for determining the

380

relative time of infection. In this situation, looking at multiple isotypes including IgA as well as

381

multiple antigens may be beneficial in determining the relative infection timeline. Along these

382

lines, we also found that individuals having multiple antibodies isotypes to both RBD and N had

383

the best neutralization. Moreover, we found that individuals who had IgG in combination with

384

IgM and IgA against the RBD had the greatest neutralization capacity, suggesting that the

385

generation of combinations of antibody isotypes against the RBD may provide the best

386

neutralization. It has been shown that severity of disease can play an important role in the antibody

387

response and it may be that in these individuals, disease is a driver for multiple isotypes and

388

increased neutralization15,34. Thus, understanding how enhanced disease burden leads to the

389

generation of multiple neutralizing isotypes will be crucial for vaccine development.

390

These results, particularly the presence of individuals with low neutralizing antibodies are

391

interesting as each individual in our cohort has recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. This

392

observation suggests that either we missed the period of robust neutralizing antibody production

393

in certain individuals or other mechanisms, such as potent SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell

394

responses35,36,37-41, provided effective viral clearance and immunity. Future studies coupling

395

assessment of antibody and T-cell responses with key clinical information (age, sex, severity of

396

symptoms) will be essential to fully understand this complex immune response. Moreover, these

397

results also highlight the need to study the SARS-CoV-2 genetics as the virus encodes multiple

398

undefined accessory proteins that could impact the immune response during infection.

399

Additionally, longitudinal studies are necessary to fully understand the complex immune response

400

to SARS-CoV-2 in the hopes to contain this virus and to prepare for the emergence of related

401

viruses.

Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response. a. Schematic representation of the experimental
design. b. Correlation analysis of the sera neutralization level of 101 COVID-19 convalescent patients. The data
presented are the log2 of the neutralization titer against the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus (1/MIC) and the pseudotyped virus (1/IC90). Correlation and linear regression analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8. P
values were calculated using a two-sided F-test. c. SARS-CoV-2 neutralization categories. Sera of convalescent
patients was defined as low (dil:1/10 to 1/80), intermediate (dil:1/81 to 1/639) and high (dil > 1/640) based on
authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus (blue box) or pseudotyped virus (red box). P values were calculated using two-sided
Fisher’s exact test. d. Rank of the absolute differences in neutralization capacity from sera of 101 COVID-19
convalescent patients. Neutralization titers against SARS-CoV-2 virus (blue) or pseudotyped virus (red) was
ordered based on the absolute difference between 1/MIC and 1/IC90. Dashed lines indicate the different neutralization categories. The gray box highlights those samples with the highest absolute difference in the neutralization
capacity between SARS-CoV-2 virus (blue) or pseudotyped virus (red). e. Distribution of authentic SARS-CoV-2
virus neutralization titers (1/MIC) over days post symptom onset. Dashed lines indicate the neutralization levels as
defined in panel B. White dots indicate two individuals with SARS-CoV-2 non-neutralizing sera.

ELISA titers and corresponding authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Serological data from the 101 COVID-19 patients was ranked
from low to high neutralization. Sera of convalescent patients was defined as low (dil:1/10 to 1/80), intermediate (dil:1/81 to 1/639) and
high (dil > 1/640). Red bar indicates those COVID-19 patients with high neutralizer antibodies. c. Correlation analysis of anti-RBD IgM
vs IgG (left panel), anti-RBD IgA vs IgG (middle panel) and anti-RBD IgA vs IgM (right panel). d. Correlation analysis of anti-N IgM vs
IgG (left panel), anti-N IgA vs IgG (middle panel) and anti-N IgA vs IgM (right panel). For (c) and (d) correlation and linear regression
analyses were performed using the linear model function in R (lm). P values were calculated using a two-sided F-test. The size of the
dots indicates the MIC and the color of the dots indicates the neutralization category: High (red dots), Intermediate (blue) and Low
(gray) as determined using authentic SARS-CoV-2 neutralization (see Fig. 2 legend).

Extended Data Figure 2. Individual sera neutralization of pseudotyped virus. Pseudotyped virus was mixed
1:1 with 2-fold dilutions of individual sera and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes before infecting
ACE2-293T cells. Relative infection was determined by luciferase expression 48 hrs post-incubation. Data is
represented as the percentage of the untreated control. Data was fitted to a variable slope model log(serum
dilution) versus response using Graph Pad prism.

Extended Data Figure 3. Correlations between isotype composition of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent serum and
days post onset of symptoms. Correlations of anti-RBD (top) or anti-N (bottom) IgG (a), IgM (b) and IgA (c) over days
post onset of symptoms are shown. Quartiles were defined based on positive samples (data points > cutoff) for anti-RBD
IgG. Each quartile has the following number of observations: anti-RBD IgG (n= 29, 30, 18, 22), anti-N IgG (n= 11, 13, 5,
8), anti-RBD IgM (n= 23, 20, 15, 17), anti-N IgM (n= 11, 12, 10, 8), anti-RBD IgA (n= 24, 28, 15, 20), anti-N IgA (n= 4, 2,
2, 2). P values were calculated using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The red dashed lines indicate the threshold (anti-N
ELISA for -IgG, -IgM or -IgA are OD450nm = 9; anti-RBD ELISA for -IgG is OD490nm = 1.091; -IgM is OD490nm = 0.256
and -IgA is OD490nm = 0.694) for each ELISA.

Anti-N ELISA correlation for IgG (top), IgA (Middle) and IgM (Bottom) with viral neutralization
using authentic SARS-CoV-2 (a) or Pseudotyped virus (b). Correlation and linear regression
analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8. P values were calculated using a two-sided
F-test. The red dashed lines indicate the threshold (anti-RBD ELISA for -IgG; -IgM and -IgA is
OD450nm > 9) for each ELISA.
