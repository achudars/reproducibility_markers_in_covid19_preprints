Summary
Here we propose a vaccination strategy for SARS-CoV-2 based on identification
of both highly conserved regions of the virus and newly acquired adaptations that are
presented by MHC class I and II across the vast majority of the population, are highly
dissimilar from the human proteome, and are predicted B cell epitopes. We present 65
peptide sequences that we expect to result in a safe and effective vaccine which can be
rapidly tested in DNA, mRNA, or synthetic peptide constructs. These include epitopes
that are contained within evolutionarily divergent regions of the spike protein reported to
increase infectivity through increased binding to the ACE2 receptor, and within a novel
furin cleavage site thought to increase membrane fusion. This vaccination strategy
specifically targets unique vulnerabilities of SARS-CoV-2 and should engage a robust
adaptive immune response in the vast majority of the human population.

Introduction

The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has precipitated an urgent need to rapidly
develop and deploy a safe and effective vaccine. Optimally designed vaccines
maximize immunogenicity towards regions of proteins that contribute most to protective
immunity, while minimizing the antigenic load contributed by unnecessary protein
domains that may result in autoimmunity, reactogenicity, or even enhanced infectivity.
Here we propose a vaccine concept that focuses on: 1) stimulation of CD4 and CD8 T
cells, 2) immunogenicity across the majority of human HLA alleles, 3) targeting both
evolutionarily conserved regions, as well as newly divergent regions of the virus that
increase infectivity, 4) targeting linear and conformational B cell epitopes, and 5)
targeting viral regions with the highest degree of dissimilarity to the selfimmunopeptidome, maximizing safety and immunogenicity. We present a list of viral
antigen minigenes for use in a multivalent vaccine construct that can be delivered by
scalable techniques such as DNA, nucleoside mRNA, or synthetic peptides.

SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus in the past two decades to acquire
infectivity in humans and result in regional epidemics, with SARS-CoV-2 causing a
global pandemic. The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 dictates species tropism and
is thought to bind to ACE2 receptors with 10-20-fold higher affinity than SARS-CoV in
humans (Walls et al.; Wrapp et al., 2020). In addition, cleavage at a novel furin insertion
site is predicted to facilitated membrane fusion and confer increased virulence, as has
been previously reported with other viruses (Chen et al., 1998). Based on initial reports,
infection of ACE2-expressing pneumocytes lining the pulmonary alveoli likely impairs

release of surfactants that maintain surface tension, hindering the ability to prevent
accumulation of fluid that may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (Xu et al.,
2020; Zhang et al., 2020). The immune response of convalescent COVID-19 patients
consists of antibody-secreting cells releasing IgG and IgM antibodies, increased
follicular helper T cells, and activated CD4 and CD8 T cells (Thevarajan et al., 2020),
suggesting that a broad humoral and T cell driven immune response mediates the
clearance of infection. The large size of the SARS-CoV-2 (~29kb) suggests that
selection of optimal epitopes and reduction of unnecessary antigenic load for
vaccination will be essential for safety and efficacy.

Rapid deployment of antibody-based vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 raises a
major concern in accelerating infectivity through Antibody-Dependent Enhancement
(ADE), the facilitation of viral entry into host cells mediated by subneutralizing
antibodies (those capable of binding viral particles, but not neutralizing them)
(Dejnirattisai et al., 2016). ADE mechanisms have been described with other members
of the Coronaviridae family (Wan et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2016), and it has already
been suggested that some of the heterogeneity in COVID-19 cases may be due to ADE
from prior infection from other viruses in the coronavirus family (Tetro, 2020). We
suggest that although the T cell epitopes presented here are expected to be safe in
vaccination, B cell epitopes should be further evaluated for their ability to induce
neutralizing antibodies as compared to their potential to induce ADE. As it has been
shown that T helper (TH) cell responses are essential in humoral immune memory
response (Alspach et al., 2019; McHeyzer-Williams, Okitsu, Wang, & McHeyzer-

Williams, 2012), we expect that the T cell epitopes presented here will activate a CD4 T
cells and drive memory B cell formation when paired with matched B cell epitopes.

The potential of a peptide-based vaccine to induce a memory B and T cell
response is complicated by the diversity of HLA alleles across the human population.
The HLA locus is the most polymorphic region of the human genome, resulting in
differential presentation of antigens to the immune system in each individual. Therefore,
individual epitopes may be presented in a mutually exclusive manner across individuals,
confounding the ability to immunize with broadly presented antigens. While T cell
receptors (TCRs) recognize linearized peptides anchored in the MHC groove, B cell
receptors (BCRs) can recognize both linear and conformational epitopes, and are
therefore difficult to predict without prior knowledge of a protein structure. Here we
describe an approach for prioritizing viral epitopes and present a list of peptides
predicted to safely target the vulnerabilities of SARS-CoV-2, generating highly
immunogenic epitopes on both MHC class I and II in the vast majority of the population,
increasing the likelihood that prioritized epitopes will drive an adaptive memory
response.

Results
We used our recently published methods for scoring population-scale HLA
presentation of individual putative cancer antigens along the length of a protein to
analyze the population-scale HLA presentation of individual peptides derived from all 10
SARS-CoV-2 genes across 84 Class I HLA alleles (Yarmarkovich et al., 2020),
representing 99.4% of the population represented in the Bone Marrow Registry
(Gragert, Madbouly, Freeman, & Maiers, 2013). We identified 3524 SARS-CoV-2
epitopes that are predicted to bind at least one HLA class I allele, with peptide
FVNEFYAYL capable of binding 30 unique HLA alleles representing 90.2% of the US
population (Figure 1A, top; Table 1; Table S1). We tested various epitope sizes to
maximize HLA presentation across the viral proteome, finding that 33 amino acid
epitopes generated maximal population-scale HLA presentation, and suggest that these
33mers can be expressed in a multicistronic construct in dendritic cells to induce potent
immune response across the vast majority of the population (An, Rodriguez, Harkins,
Zhang, & Whitton, 2000; Lu et al., 2014). We identified areas predicted to be presented
across

As it has been shown that presentation by both Class I and Class II MHC is
necessary for robust memory B and T cell responses (Alspach et al., 2019; McHeyzerWilliams et al., 2012), we next analyzed presentation of these viral epitopes on 36 MHC
Class II HLA alleles, representing 92.6% of the population (Figure 1A, bottom; Table

IAMSAFAMMFVKHKHAFLCLFLLPSLATVAYFN were presented on 24 HLA class II
alleles, representing 82.1% of US population, and peptides from the same epitope were
predicted to be presented on 74 HLA class I alleles with a population frequency of
98.6%. As HLA frequencies vary based on the composition of each population, the
frequency of individual HLA alleles can be adjusted based on specific populations using
a SARs-CoV-2 immunogenicity map created here (Table S1).

Next, we sought to identify the most highly conserved regions of the SARS-CoV2 virus, positing that non-conserved regions that are not involved in newly acquired
increased infectivity may be prone to T cell evasion through mutation of MHC-presented
epitopes. To do this, we compared the amino acid sequence of SARS-CoV-2 to
fourteen Coronaviridae family sequences derived from bats, pigs, and camels, scoring
each amino acid for conservation across the viral strains. We also scored the
conservation across the 1,024 SARS-CoV-2 virus sequences available at the time of
this analysis, equally weighing contributions from cross-species and interhuman
variation (scores normalized to 0-1, with entirely conserved regions scoring 1). As
expected, evolutionary divergence was greatest in the tropism-determining Spike
protein and lowest in ORF1ab which contains 16 proteins involved in viral replication
(Figure 1B, bottom).

We then compared predicted viral MHC-presented epitopes to self-peptides
presented normally on 84 HLA alleles across the entire human proteome from UniProt,
prioritizing antigens that are most dissimilar from self-peptides based on: 1) higher
predicted safety based on less likelihood of inducing autoimmunity due to cross-

reactivity with similar self-peptides presented on MHC; and 2) higher immunogenicity of
dissimilar peptides based on an expected greater repertoire of antigen-specific T cells
due to lower degree of negative thymic selection. To do this, we compared 3,524 viral
epitopes against the normal human proteome on each of their MHC binding partners,
testing a total of 12,383 peptide/MHC pairs against the entire human proteome
(85,915,364 normal peptides across HLAs), assigning a similarity score for each
peptide, with high scoring peptides representing the highest degree of dissimilarity as
compared to the space of all possible MHC epitopes derived from the normal proteome
(Methods; Figure 1B, bottom; Table S1).

To assign an overall score for T cell antigens, we normalized each of our four
scoring parameters (represented in Figure 1A and 1B) between 0-1 and summed each
metric to obtain a final epitope score, highlighting the local maxima of epitopes scoring
in the 90th percentile, highlighting 55 top scoring T cell epitopes across 9 SARS-CoV-2
genes as epitopes for vaccination (Figure 1C red bars, Table S2).

Finally, we sought to characterize B cell epitopes, assessing linear epitopes in
Spike (S), Matrix (M), and Envelope (E) proteins which are exposed and expected to be
accessible to antibodies, and characterized conformational epitopes in the Spike protein
for which structural data are available using BepiPred 2.0 and DiscoTope 2.0
(Jespersen, Peters, Nielsen, & Marcatili, 2017; Kringelum, Lundegaard, Lund, &
Nielsen, 2012). There was a strong concordance between linear epitope scores and
conformational epitope scores (p<2e-16). We next performed an agnostic scoring of
individual amino acid residues in S, M, and E proteins (Figure 1D), and then used these

scores to generate scores for 33mer epitopes along the length of the protein (Figure
1E). The 33mer VGGNYNYLYRLFRKSNLKPFERDISTEIYQAGS derived from S protein
at position 445 ranked the highest based on combined linear and conformational B cell
epitope scoring. We combined T cell epitope scores calculated above with available B
cell epitope scores derived from the S, M, and E genes, providing a list of antigens
predicted to stimulate both humoral and cellular adaptive immunity (Figure 1F).

In addition to prioritizing evolutionarily conserved regions, we sought to
specifically target acquired vulnerabilities in SARS-CoV-2 by focusing on novel features
of this coronavirus that have been shown to contribute to its increased infectivity. The
receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein has been reported to have
10-fold higher binding affinity to ACE2 (Wrapp et al., 2020). We show that viral epitope
GEVFNATRFASVYAWNRKRISNCVADYSVLYNS derived from the receptor binding
domain (RBD) of the Spike protein (position 339-372) scores in the 90.9th percentile of T
epitopes and is the #3 of 1,546 epitopes scored in the S, E, and M genes for combined
B and T cell epitopes, with presentation by MHC class I in 98.3% of the population
(Figures 1C/F & 2, red). Additionally, a novel furin cleavage site has been reported in
the SARS-CoV-2 virus, resulting in increased infectivity (Wrapp et al., 2020). Indeed, we
find that the epitope SYQTQTNSPRRARSVASQSIIAYTMSLGAENSV containing the
RRAR furin cleavage site of the spike protein ranks in the 90.7th percentile of T cell
epitopes and ranks first of 1546 in combined B and T cell epitope, (Figures 1C/F & 2,
orange), thereby targeting an additional evolutionary adaptation of SARS-CoV-2. Based
on a recently published study identifying receptor binding hotspots deduced by
comparing structures of ACE2 bound to the Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 as

containing all of these residues (hotspots underlined; Table 1). Finally, it is known that
mRNA transcripts proximal to the 3’ end of the Coronaviridae family genome show
higher abundance consistent with the viral replication process, with S, E, M, and N
genes shown to have significantly higher translational efficiency compared to the 5’
transcripts (Cheng, Lau, Woo, & Yuen, 2007; Hiscox, Cavanagh, & Britton, 1995;
Irigoyen et al., 2016). We therefore posit that viral epitopes derived from 3’ terminus
including the S, E, M, and N genes will have a higher representation on MHC and
suggest their prioritization in a vaccine construct. Tables 1, Figure 2, Tables S2, and S3
show viral epitopes we suggest prioritizing for vaccine development.

Discussion

Here we present a comprehensive immunogenicity map of the SARS-CoV-2
virus (Table S1), highlighting 65 B and T cell epitopes (Tables 1, S1 and S2) from a
diverse sampling of viral domains across all 9 SARS-CoV-2 genes. Based on our
computational algorithm, we expect that the highest scoring peptides will result in safe
and immunogenic T cell epitopes, and that B cell epitopes should be evaluated for
safety and efficacy using methods previously reported (Wang et al., 2016). mRNA
vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective in preclinical studies (Richner et al.,
2017), with nucleoside RNAs shown to be effective without triggering RNA-induced
immunogenicity (Pardi et al., 2017), while DNA vaccines have also been shown to be
safe and protective (Dowd et al., 2016). Both DNA and mRNA vaccines are capable of
being rapidly and efficiently manufactured at large scales. We suggest that a multivalent
construct composed of the SARS-CoV-2 minigenes (presented in Tables 1, S2, and S3)
can be used in a DNA on mRNA vaccine for expression in antigen-presenting cells.
These epitopes can be used in tandem with a TLR agonist such as tetanus toxoid
(Zanetti, Ferreira, de Vasconcelos, & Han, 2019) to drive activation of signals 1 and 2 in
antigen presenting cells. Constructs can be designed to contain a combination of
optimal B and T cell epitopes, or deployed as a construct consisting of the top scoring T
cell epitopes to be used in combination with the vaccines currently being developed
targeting the Spike protein in order to drive the adaptive memory response. DNA
vaccine sequences can also be codon optimized to increase CpG islands such as to
increase TLR9 activation (Krieg, 2008).

The methods described here provide a rapid workflow for evaluating and
prioritizing safe and immunogenic regions of a viral genome for use in vaccination. With
the third epidemic in the past two decades underway, and all originating from a
coronavirus family virus, these viruses will continue to threaten the human population,
and necessitate the need for prophylactic measures against future outbreaks. A subset
of the epitopes selected here are derived from viral regions sharing a high degree of
homology with other viruses in the family, and thus we expect these evolutionarily
conserved regions to be essential in the infectivity and replicative lifecycle across the
coronavirus family, suggesting that an immune response against the epitopes listed
herein may provide more broadly protective immunity against other coronaviruses.
Additionally, we describe epitopes containing the newly acquired features of SARSCoV-2 that confer evolutionary advantages in viral spread and infectivity. In addition, the
immunogenicity map provided in Table S1 can be used to customize epitopes based on
the HLA frequencies of specific populations. Though here we suggest the use of
33mers based on optimal MHC presentation across the population, these methods can
be applied to evaluate k-mers of various sizes depending on desired application.

Antigenic burden from epitopes that do not contribute to viral protection can
cause autoimmune reactions, reactogenicity, detract from the efficacy of the virus, or
result in ADE. To mitigate these effects a priori, we selected maximally immunogenic
epitopes with the highest degree of dissimilarity to the self-proteome such as to
minimize the potential of cross-reactivity that can lead to adverse reaction or minimize
the efficacy of the virus. In addition to the predicted safety of these epitopes stemming
from lack of potentially cross-reactive normal proteins, we expect that a greater

repertoire of viral antigen-specific T cells will exist due to lack of negative thymic
selection. We prioritize epitopes with maximal dissimilarity from the human proteome,
however, many other SARS-CoV-2 peptides show identical or nearly identical peptides
presented on MHC derived from normal proteins, suggesting their use in vaccination
could result in an autoimmune response. The 65 epitopes presented here can be
expressed in a ~6.3kb construct and coupled with the safe and rapid production of
synthetic DNA, mRNA, and peptide vaccines. As SARS-CoV-2 has precipitated the
need to develop novel approaches to rapidly deploy vaccines in pandemic situations
(Lurie, Saville, Hatchett, & Halton, 2020), we suggest that this comprehensive analysis
can be incorporated into a process that can be rapidly deployed when future novel viral
pathogens emerge.

STAR Methods
Population-scale HLA Class I & II Presentation
We identified potential SARS-CoV-2 epitopes by applying our recently published
algorithm for scoring population-scale HLA presentation of tumor driver gene, to the
SARS-CoV-2 genome (GenBank Acc#: MN908947.3) (Yarmarkovich et al., 2020). All
possible 33mer amino acid sequences covering every 9mer peptide from the 10 SARSCoV-2 genes were generated and we employed netMHC-4.0 to predict the binding
affinities of each viral peptide across 84 HLA class I alleles. We considered peptides
with binding affinities <500nM putative epitopes. MHC class II binding affinities were
predicted as previously described across 36 HLA class II alleles population using
netMHCII 2.3.
The frequencies of HLA class I alleles -A/B/C and HLA class II alleles -DRB1/3/4/5 were
obtained from Be the Match bone marrow registry (Gragert et al., 2013).HLA class II
alleles -DQA1/DQB1 and -DPA1/DPB1 were obtained from (Sidney et al., 2010) and
(Solberg et al., 2008), respectively.
Conservation Scoring:
We obtained all 1,024 unique protein sequences categorized by each of the 10 SARSCoV-2 genes available from the NCBI as of 25 March 2020. All sequences were aligned
using Clustal Omega (Sievers et al., 2011) and each position summed for homology. In
addition to human sequences, we scored each amino acid position for homology across
15 species of related coronavirus found in bats, pigs, camels, mice, and humans
(SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS). Each amino acid was scored up to 100%
conservation. 33mer peptides were then scored in Equation 1:



[1]

Where C is the 33mer conservation score, A is the conservation percentage of an
amino acid position, Y is the minimum 33mer conservation percentage sum, and Z is
the maximum 33mer conservation percentage sum. In the same way, we ranked the
conservation across 274 SARS-CoV-2 amino acid sequences available at the time of
this study. A final conservation score was generated by averaging the conservation
scores from cross-species and interhuman variation and 33mer peptides with the
highest score were considered the most conserved.
Dissimilarity Scoring
3,524 viral epitopes were compared against the normal human proteome on each of
their MHC binding partners, testing a total of 12, 383 peptide/MHC pairs against the

entire human proteome (85,915,364 normal peptides across HLAs), assigning a
similarity score for each peptide. Residues in the same position of the viral and human
peptides with a perfect match, similar amino acid classification, or different polarity,
were assigned scores of five, two, or negative two respectively. Similarity scores were
calculated based on amino acid classification and hydrophobicity were determined
using non-anchor residues of MHC (Figure S1A). The canonical TCR-interaction
hotspots (residues four through six) were double weighted (Gagnon et al., 2005; Gras et
al., 2009; Ishizuka et al., 2008). The similarity scores generated for each viral peptide
were converted to Z-scores and peptides with a p <0.0001 were selected for
comparison to viral epitopes (Figure S1B). The overall dissimilarity score for the viral
peptide was then calculated using Equation 2:

where ௌ௜௠ is the overall dissimilarity score for the viral peptide, ெ௔௫ is the highest possible
Z-score given a perfect sequence match to the viral peptide, ்௢௣ is the highest Z-score from
the human proteome, ௌ௜௚ is the number of statistically significant peptides from the human
proteome, and ௌ௜௚ is the mean Z-score from the statistically significant peptides given a p <
0.001.

B cell Epitope Scoring
We used BepiPred 2.0 and DiscoTope 2.0 (Jespersen et al., 2017; Kringelum et al.,
2012) to score individual amino acid residues, assessing linear epitopes in Matrix,
Envelope, and Spike proteins, and conformational epitopes for Spike protein, based on
published structure (PDB 6VYB). To we summed and normalized linear and
conformational, using separate normalizations for proteins in which only linear
predictions were available.
