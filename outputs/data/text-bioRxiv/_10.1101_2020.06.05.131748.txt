Abstract
The recently emerged coronavirus disease COVID-19 has now evolved into a global
pandemic. Early detection is crucial for its effective control. Nucleic acid testing for
viral pathogen and serological testing for host antibodies are playing important roles in
current COVID-19 diagnosis. However, while nucleic acid testing is complicated,
facility-restricted and time-consuming, antibody testing may result in high rates of
false-negative diagnoses, especially during the early stages of viral infection. Thus, a
more rapid and reliable test for both early COVID-19 diagnosis and whole-population
screening is urgently needed. Here, we developed a novel nanozyme-based
chemiluminescence paper assay for rapid and high-sensitive testing of SARS-CoV-2
spike antigen. Our paper test uses a newly established peroxidase-mimic Co-Fe@hemin
nanozyme instead of natural HRP that catalytically amplifies the chemiluminescent
signal, allowing for target concentrations to be as low as 0.1 ng/ml. Furthermore, our
nanozyme-based chemiluminescence test exhibits a linear range that is 32-fold wider
compared to ELISA tests. Importantly, testing is completed in less than 16 min,
compared to 1-2 h required for ELISA or nucleic acid tests. Critically, signal detection
is feasible using a smartphone camera. Ingredients for our test are simple and readily
available, rendering overall cost considerably lower than those used in current
diagnoses. In conclusion, our novel test provides a high-sensitive, point-of-care testing
(POCT) approach for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection, which should greatly increase
current early screening capacities for suspected infections, and considerably lower
demand for national healthcare resources.

Introduction
Over the course of just a few months, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
developed into a global pandemic, causing over 370,000 deaths by beginning of June
20201. Etiological investigation and gene sequencing identified a novel RNA

coronavirus, provisionally named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2)2, 3. SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious, with a basic reproductive number
(R0) of approximately 3.74. SARS-CoV-2 spreads through human-to-human mediated
by droplets, contact or high-concentration aerosols in closed environment5. SARSCoV-2 mainly infects through the upper respiratory tract and causes symptoms, such as
fever, dry cough, fatigue or progressive dyspnea. One major concern for healthcare
systems is discovering the early infections in incubation period and asymptomatic
carriers, making a reliable test critical for successful control of the pandemic. Currently,
there is no effective targeted drugs or available vaccine for COVID-19. Early diagnosis
and early quarantine to cutting off the source of infection are the most effective control
means of the pandemic.
Clinical features, epidemiological history, imageology and pathogenic index play a
vital role in diagnosis of COVID-2019. At present, nucleic acid test based on
fluorescence PCR or isothermal nucleic acid amplification are primarily employed in
early diagnosis of COVID-196, 7. However, nucleic acid testing requires biosafety
laboratory, facility and skilled personnel, and is therefore unsuitable for field screening
and out of reach for many less well-endowed communities or health care systems in
developing countries. Furthermore, nucleic acid test needs RNA extraction, reverse
transcription, gene amplification and result analysis, these complicated operations take
at least 1~2 h. A second major challenge associated with nucleic acid detection is the
high false negative rates8, a potentially dangerous characteristic given the
epidemiological consequences of unidentified carriers. While PCR nucleic acid testing
is highly sensitive for the early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is not suitable
for field rapid screenings.
Antibody testing is another approach assisting nucleic acid diagnosis9. Colloidal gold
test paper, traditional chemiluminesence immunoassay (CLIA) and enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reagents have been rapidly developed10. Currently
available antibody tests detect IgM or/and IgG antibodies against nucleocapsid or spike
antigen of SARS-CoV-2 present in blood samples11, 12. While colloidal gold paper tests
are rapid and easy-to-use13, the sensitivity of colloidal gold antibody test is relatively

low compared with PCR-based testing. Critically, antibodies are generated only 10~15
days past virus exposure14, and therefore it is not suitable for early screening and
diagnosis of COVID-19, rendering early isolation and disrupting transmission
impossible.
In our previous study, we reported a nanozyme colorimetric strip test for Ebola virus
detection, which is based on Fe3O4 nanozyme-catalyzed chromogenic reaction15.
Nanozymes are nanomaterials endowed with intrinsic enzyme-mimicking activity16,
which can be used for enzyme-labeled probes. Enzymatic chemiluminescence is widely
used in In Vitro Diagnosis (IVD) due to its higher sensitivity and wider linear range
compared with ELISA. Traditional CLIA is based on a natural protease, such as natural
horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or alkaline phosphatase (ALP), all of which are
characterized by poor stability. Moreover, traditional chemiluminescence detection
depends on large instruments, which are expensive and not readily available to
individuals.
Here, we developed a nanozyme-based chemiluminescence paper test for rapid, highsensitive and portable detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen. We used Co-Fe@hemin
nanozyme as a suitable alternative to HRP, thus combining traditional CLIA with lateral
flow

and lower-income economies.

Preparation of Co-Fe@hemin nanozyme
Firstly, Co-Fe nanoparticles (Co-Fe NPs) with carboxyl modification were
synthesized through hydrothermal method. In brief, FeCl3.6H2O and CoCl2.6H2O (with
a molar ratio of 3:1 to 1:1) were dissolved in 400 mL ployethylene glycol. Next, 30 g
sodium acetate (NaAc) and 3 g poly (acrylic acid) were added under vigorous stirring.
The solution was transferred into the high-temperature autoclave and heated at 200℃
for 12~14 h. The synthesized nanoparticles were then gathered by magnetic separation
and washed with ethyl alcohol and deionized water. Subsequently, Co-Fe NPs prepared
above were added into NaAc solution. Next, hemin (with a mass concentration ratio of
2.5:1) was dropwise added into the reaction system. After continuous stirring for 2 h at
room temperature, the Co-Fe@hemin nanocomposites were purified by magnetic
separation and washed as described above.

Characterization of Co-Fe@hemin nanozyme
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a Tecnai Sprit
microscope instrument operating at 120 KV (FEI Inc., America). The scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) images were taken on a SU8020 microscope instrument (Hitachi,
Japan). The hydrate particle size of Co-Fe@hemin nanozyme was measured using a
271-DPN dynamic light scattering (DLS) instrument. The UV-Vis absorbance spectra

were scanned using a U-3900 absorption spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan) in a
wavelength range of 200~600 nm. Surface carboxyl group modification was
characterized using Thermo Gravimetric-Differential Scanning Calorimeter (TG-DSC)
analysis using STA449F3 Jupiter (Netzsch, German) at a heating rate of 10℃/min
under N2 protection. The elemental analysis was performed using Energy Dispersive
Spectroscopy (EDS) equipped in a SEM microscope instrument.

Catalytic activity evaluation of peroxidase-mimic Co-Fe@hemin
nanozyme
The peroxidase activity of Co-Fe@hemin nanozyme was measured according to a
previously published procedure17. In brief, nanoparticles of different concentrations
were added to 2 mL HAc/NaAc buffer (0.2 M, pH 3.6), then 100 µl TMB and 100 µl
H2O2 (30% wt/vol) were added to the cuvette. The absorbance at 652 nm was measured
for 1 min at the temperature of 37℃, and the rection-time curve was plotted. The
specific activity (SA, U/mg) of nanozyme was calculated. The chemiluminescence
catalytic activity was assessed by EnVision Multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer) using
a liquid auto-injection system and luminol substrate. The maximum chemiluminescent
intensities catalyzed by Co-Fe@hemin nanozyme were measured at different pH,
temperature pretreatment and different concentrations of H2O2, with HRP as positive
control. Moreover, the intermediate reactive oxygen species in the reaction system were
monitored by using electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy and the spin trap agent,
5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO).

Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and antibody preparation
The recombinant antigen is a receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein (S-RBD, located in the S1 subunit) 18. A cDNA sequence encoding S-RBD was
expressed containing both N-terminal natural signal peptide as well as a 6×His tag at
the C-terminus, after transfection into HEK293 cells. After 3 days, supernatants were
collected and soluble protein was sequentially purified using HisTrap HP column and

Superdex 200 column. The concentration of S-RBD protein was determined using a
BCA assay kit (Pierce). The purity of recombinant protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
Aliquoted protein was stored at -20℃~-80℃ until further use.
Anti-Spike antibodies were generated by sorting single memory B cells as previously
reported19. Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from convalescent COVID-19
patients were incubated with His-tagged S-RBD at 100 nM before staining with antiCD3, anti-CD16, anti-CD235a, anti-CD19, anti-CD38, anti-CD27 and anti-His
antibodies. Antigen-specific memory B cells were identified by the following markers:
CD3-, CD16-, CD235a-, CD38-, CD19+, CD27+, hIgG+ and His+, and sorted into 96well PCR plates with single cell per/well. The genes encoding Ig VH and VL chains
were amplified by 5’RACE and nested PCR. The variable regions of these genes were
then cloned into the human IgG1 constant region to generate full-length monoclonal
antibodies, which were then expressed and purified by conventional methods. The
antibody binding affinity for S-RBD was evaluated by BIAcore 8K.

Fabrication of nanozyme-based chemiluminescence test paper
Anti-S-RBD antibody pairs were screening using ELISA method and nanozymebased colorimetric strips15. The preparation of nanozyme-based chemiluminescence
test paper resembles the colloidal gold strip with further modifications. The nanozymebased chemiluminescence test paper was constituted of a PVC backing plate, an
absorbing pad, a sample pad, a nitrocellulose membrane and a conjugate pad. First, the
detection antibody of S-RBD (S-dAb) conjugated nanozyme chemiluminescent probes
were prepared by chemical coupling of carboxyl group using EDC/NHS agents. The
labeled nanozyme probes were stored in modified TB buffer containing 5% BSA. The
nanozyme probes were dispensed on the pretreated conjugate pad using a BioDot
dispensing equipment. The paired capture antibody of S-RBD (S-cAb) was
immobilized on a nitrocellulose membrane at 1 mg/ml to form the test line (T-line), as
well as the anti-human IgG antibody as the control line (C-line). Next, the above
conjugate pad, nitrocellulose membrane, sample pad and absorbing pad were assembled

on the PVC backing plate and followed by complete drying at 37℃ for 1~2 h. The
paper boards were cut into 4 mm-wide strips. Finally, the strips were packed into clamp
slots and stored at room temperature. The solid chemiluminescence substrate, excitant
and dissolve buffer were stored in plastic ampoule bottles at room temperature.

Rapid testing of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen
In this study, rapid nanozyme-based chemiluminescence paper test of SARS-CoV-2
spike antigen was developed. Recombinant S-RBD protein of SARS-CoV-2 was used
to evaluate the sensitivity of nanozyme-based chemiluminescence paper test. 100 µl of
the sample containing S-RBD protein in dilution buffer was loaded onto the sample pad.
The liquid sample flows through the conjugate pad and then the target analytes were
recognized specifically by nanozyme probes to form immunocomplexes. Along with
lateral flow, nanozyme complexes were captured by S-dAb and aggregated at T-line,
presenting a brown color signal. Nanozyme probes uncombined with antigen bound
with the control IgG antibody at C-line. The luminol substrate and excitant were
dissolved and added onto the detection membrane after chromatography for 15min. The
chemiluminescent signals of T-line and C-line were instantly captured by a smartphone
camera or CCD imaging system (Clinx MiniChemi). In parallel, the sensitivity of
ELISA detection for S-RBD antigen was evaluated by the double-antibody sandwich
ELISA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Rapid testing of pseudo-SARS-CoV-2
The pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 were packaged by transfecting 293T cells with a HIV-1based retroviral vector coding SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 protein and luciferase reporter
gene. The pseudovirus titer was determined as 1010 virus copies/ml. The spike S1
protein expressed by pseudovirus was quantified as 860 ng/ml. The serially diluted
pseudovirus was detected by nanozyme-based chemiluminescence test paper according
to the method described above. All virus-related operations were carried out inside a
Class Ⅱ biological safety cabinet.

Results
Characterization of peroxidase-mimic Co-Fe@hemin nanozyme
Co-Fe@hemin nanozyme is a type of nanomaterial that possesses peroxidasemimicking activity. To characterize the morphology and microstructure of CoFe@hemin nanozyme, we used both TEM and SEM analysis. As shown in Fig. 1A and
B, the Co-Fe@hemin nanozymes resemble spherical particles, with a mean diameter of
approximately 80nm. DLS analysis showed that the mean hydrated diameter of our
nanozyme spheres was approximately 100 nm (Fig. 1C). In the UV-Vis spectrum, we
detected two absorption peaks for nanozyme spheres, which are corresponding to the
characteristic peaks of Co-Fe nanoparticles and hemin molecules (Fig. 1D). Using the
absorption spectrum, we verified that the hemin modification was present on the surface
of Co-Fe@hemin nanozyme. We then analyzed the surface carboxyl group modification
of Co-Fe@hemin nanozyme using TG-DSC (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, element
composition and content analysis by EDS indicated that the atomic ratio of Fe to Co in
the nanozyme particle is 13:1 (Fig. 1F).

Evaluation of catalytic activity of the Co-Fe@hemin nanozyme
Peroxidase activity of our Co-Fe@hemin nanozyme was determined by the specific
activity (SA, U/mg) according to the established procedures in literature17. TMB is one
of chromogenic substrates for HRP. As shown in Fig. 2A, the catalytic activity of CoFe@hemin in TMB chromogenic reaction was 69.915 U/mg, which is higher than CoFe NPs (9.836 U/mg) and Fe3O4 NPs (5.40 U/mg, data not shown). Next, we evaluated
the chemiluminescence catalytic properties of Co-Fe@hemin nanozyme for luminol
substrate using a EnVision Multilabel plate reader. The chemiluminescence signals of
1 µg Co-Fe@hemin and HRP were captured in the presence of excitant H2O2. As shown
in Fig. 2B, the maximum chemiluminescent intensity of Co-Fe@hemin was
comparable to that of HRP, while showing a three-fold increase over than that of CoFe NPs. In comparison, the catalytic chemiluminescence activity of Fe3O4 NPs was

found to be lower than expected.
Our Co-Fe@hemin nanozyme displayed high chemiluminescent catalytic activity
(the maximum intensity exceeds 8E+7) at the pH range of 9 to 14, demonstrating that
our nanozyme tolerate alkaline conditions (Fig. 2C). In comparison, natural HRP only
achieved its maximum catalytic activity for luminol substrate at pH 8.5, and
significantly decreased as the pH increased. As shown in Fig. 2D, temperature
pretreatment at 4 ℃ ~100 ℃ for 2 h failed to affect the catalytic activity of CoFe@hemin nanozyme. In contrast, HRP was inactivated after heat pretreatment above
80℃. Together, these results clearly showed that our nanozyme is more robust than
HRP, especially under extreme PH and temperature conditions.
Next, we investigated the reaction parameters of excitant H2O2 in Co-Fe@heminluminol catalytic system. As shown in Fig. 2E, the maximum chemiluminescent
intensity increased with the concentration of H2O2 at the range of 0.2 µM to 2 mM,
reaching the plateau phase above a concentration of 1 mM. Moreover, we monitored
superoxide anions (O2∙−) signal in Co-Fe@hemin-H2O2 system under alkaline
conditions using the ESR technique (Fig. 2F). Together, these findings indicated that
luminol was oxidated by O2∙− radicals derived from the reaction of Co-Fe@hemin with
H2O2, suggesting a possible mechanism of nanozyme-catalyzed chemiluminescence.

Design of the nanozyme-based chemiluminescence paper test
After successfully validating the different core parts of our novel testing platform,
we next designed the nanozyme-based chemiluminescence paper test. Fig. 3A depicts
the design of our nanozyme-based chemiluminescence paper test for SARS-CoV-2 SRBD antigen. Our paper test is based on the principle of a double antibody sandwich
immunoassay. First, Co-Fe@hemin NPs labeled with S-dAb as the chemiluminescence
probes were dispersed onto the conjugate pad. Along with the lateral flow of the sample,
nanozyme probes combined with S-RBD antigen and S-cAb, forming the sandwich
immunocomplexes. The nanozyme probes possess high peroxidase activity and thus
catalyze luminol substrate in the presence of H2O2 under alkaline condition, resulting

in chemiluminescence. This chemiluminescent signal is then captured and analyzed by
a smartphone camera or CCD imaging system (Clinx MiniChemi). The detection can
be completed within 16 min. The chemiluminescent intensity ratio of T-line to C-line is
positively correlated with the concentrations of S-RBD antigen. Due to the small
bonding surface of S-RBD antigen and sequence differences from other βcoronaviruses (such as HCoV-HUK1 and HCoV-OC43)20, it is unlikely that crossreactivity will occur for non-target antigen.
To identify the best paired antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD antigen, we next
screened a series of anti-spike antibodies using ELISA. Among the six antibodies tested,
clones GH4, CB6, TP52 and RP01 exhibited high binding activity for recombinant SRBD protein (Fig. 3B). We then manufactured the nanozyme probes labeled with CB6
and RP01 clones respectively, and combined these probes with strips immobilized with
GH4, RP01, TP52 and GH4, TP52 as capture antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3C, the CB6
and GH4 pair gave the best performance in S-RBD detection. However, all other clone
pairings resulted in problematic combinations, suggesting that these antibodies
recognize either identical or crossed antigenic epitopes. Thus, we chose CB6 as a
detection antibody and GH4 as a capture antibody for our final antibody pairs in
nanozyme-based chemiluminescence paper test.

Rapid testing of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen
Using the CB6 and GH4 pair, we manufactured the nanozyme-based
chemiluminescence test strips to detect S-RBD antigen. To assess the sensitivity of our
test, we prepared a serial dilution of S-RBD protein samples. Following a
chromatography procedure at room temperature for 15 minutes, the color signals of Tline were observed by naked eyes at a concentration higher than 25 ng/ml. Next, we
added the luminol substrate solution. The chemiluminescent signal was instantly
captured using a CCD or smartphone camera in dark environment (Fig. 4A). Next, we
analyzed the chemiluminescent signal intensity using the Image-Pro Plus software. The
calibration curve of antigen test was plotted as shown in Fig. 4B. Our analysis showed

that our test detected as little as 0.1 ng/ml of S-RBD protein. The detection limit for SRBD was defined as X+3SD (X: mean of the negative control, SD: standard
deviation) value. The linearity of our test was identified as ranging from 0.2 to 100
ng/ml, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9855 (Fig. 4B). As the parallel test using
ELISA, S-RBD antigen was detectable at 0.1 ng/ml, with a linear calibration curve
ranging from 0.1 to 1.56 ng/ml (Fig. 4C). The sensitivity of our nanozyme-based
chemiluminescence paper test of S-RBD protein was similar to that of ELISA, however,
at least 32-fold enlargement in linearity range.
Moreover, the nanozyme-based chemiluminescence paper test specifically
recognized the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD protein, whereas it failed to detect the spike
proteins of other known coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-HKU1
and HCoV-OC43 (Fig. 4D). While SARS-CoV-2 shares more than 60% similarities
with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-HKU1 as well as HCoV-OC43 (cause common
flu) as identified by genome sequence analysis20, we clearly demonstrated here that our
paper test is specific for SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen.

Rapid testing of pseudo-SARS-CoV-2
To verify the validity of our paper test in actual viral infection, we collected the
pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 expressing spike protein (S1 subunit). The titer of pseudo-SARSCoV-2 stock was determined as 1.0E+10 virus copies/ml using real-time RT-PCR.
Gradient dilution series of pseudovirus were detected by the nanozyme-based
chemiluminescence test paper. As shown in Fig. 5A, the detection limit of
chemiluminescence paper test for pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 was 7.81E+6 copy/ml
(corresponding to 0.671 ng/ml S1 protein). The linearity of our paper test was ranging
from 7.81E+6 to 2E+9 copy/ml (R2=0.9907) (Fig. 5B). In the parallel test, the
sensitivity of ELISA reached 7.81E+6 copy/ml, with a relatively narrow linear range
(from 3.91E+6 to 6.25E+7 copy/ml) (Fig. 5C).

Here, we present a novel SARS-CoV-2 antigen paper test that outperformed
traditional paper test and HRP-based immunoassay. In this study, we successfully
combined

nanozyme-catalyzed

chemiluminescence

with

a

lateral

immunochromatographic system to achieve ultra-sensitive as well as rapid testing for
SARS-CoV-2 antigen, which should greatly benefit the early screening and diagnosis
of COVID-19.
In this study, we designed and synthesized a type of peroxidase-mimic CoFe@hemin nanozyme that catalyzes chemiluminescence reaction as efficiently as the
natural protease HRP. The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 antigen test by nanozyme-based
chemiluminescence strip was comparable to that of ELISA. The chemiluminescencecatalyzed signal amplification makes a great improvement in sensitivity of paper test,
in contrast to traditional colloidal gold, fluorescence strip or nanozyme-based
colorimetric strip. The high sensitivity of detection might lower the false negative rate
in the early screenings of virus infection.
In addition, our nanozyme-based chemiluminescence paper test is especially useful
in POCT. Resembling traditional paper test, our test is rapid and easy to implement.
Our paper test was completed within 16 minutes, which is faster than either nucleic acid
testing or ELISA method. Our test can be operated without requirement for skilled
personnel or dedicated site, thus it might be suitable for use at the bedside, in
communities as well as open public places. Moreover, all ingredients are thermostable
at ambient temperature. The detection can be performed using a portable device, thus
our paper test is available and convenient for field use. In contrast, the nucleic acid and
traditional chemiluminescence detection dependents on large and expensive
instruments, which are only available for the central laboratory or inspection agency.
Therefore, this approach for antigen test is more applicable to rapid field screening,
which should greatly facilitate regional control measures of COVID-19 pandemic.
Importantly, we achieved the replacement of natural HRP using Co-Fe@hemin
nanozyme in our paper test. Traditional chemiluminescence immunodiagnosis use
natural proteases such as HRP or alkaline phosphatase as the core materials21, which
are unstable, complex to produce and incur high-cost. In our study, we show that Co-

Fe@hemin nanozyme exhibits better stability for temperature and acidity or alkalinity
compared with HRP. Thus, the nanozyme-based chemiluminescence test paper can be
stored and used at ambient temperature, benefiting outdoor settings that lack
refrigeration equipment. Importantly, the catalytic efficiency for luminol substrate of
Co-Fe@hemin nanozyme is comparable to HRP. In previous studies, peroxidase
activities of the vast majority of nanozymes were lower than HRP. While Karyakin’s
group has reported that Prussian Blue nanoparticles possess peroxidase activity superior
to HRP22, this activity sharply decreases in alkaline condition of chemiluminescence
catalysis according to our test results. The high chemiluminescent catalytic activity of
Co-Fe@hemin nanozyme is key to improving the sensitivity of our paper test. Moreover,
the synthesis of nanozyme is relies on readily available materials and is easily scaled
up without need for expensive equipment, thus, nanozyme material is relatively lowcost compared with nature HRP, which are produced by complex extraction and
purification. Therefore, the overall cost of nanozyme-based chemiluminescence paper
test is relatively low compared with traditional chemiluminescence or nucleic acid
testing. This advantage may reduce costs usually incurred by universal screening, and
critically, benefit regions of low socio-economic standing.
While our study clearly showed that our test is superior to currently available
detection procedures, it is critical to further validate the accuracy of our paper test for
real clinical samples. Theoretically, this paper test will be suitable for multiple sample
candidates covering throat swab, sputum, urine, saliva or serum in particular sample
preservation buffer. At the time of our investigation, the officially authorized reagents
for rapid testing of SARS-CoV-2 antigen remained unavailable, thus comparisons of
commercial kits with our test paper in clinical sample detection require future
investigation.
Lastly, our proof-of-principle study was primarily designed to enable qualitative
analysis, which was achieved by means of a readily available smartphone technology.
To allow for quantitative analysis of clinical samples, a quantitative test should be
developed. A portable handheld device equipped with signal acquisition and data
analysis function for our nanozyme-based chemiluminescence paper test is currently

being developed.
In conclusion, nanozyme-based chemiluminescence paper test combines the highsensitivity of chemiluminescence, high-specificity of immunoassay and short testing
time of lateral flow chromatography technique. Due to the excellent performance,
remarkable portability and low-cost, nanozyme-based chemiluminescence paper test
should provide a novel point-of-care approach for early screening of SARS-CoV-2
infections. Moreover, as a universal paper-based POCT technique, it has promising
potential in diagnosis application for emerging infectious diseases of pandemic
potential.
