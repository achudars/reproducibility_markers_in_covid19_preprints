Abstract

26

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome

27

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global pandemic that began in December 2019.

28

Lymphopenia is a common feature in severe cases of COVID-19; however, the role of T cell

29

responses during infection is unclear. Here, we inoculated six cynomolgus monkeys, divided

30

into two groups according to the CD3+ T cell population in peripheral blood, with two clinical

31

isolates of SARS-CoV-2: one of East Asian lineage and one of European lineage. After initial

32

infection with the isolate of East Asian lineage, all three monkeys in the CD3+ low group

33

showed clinical symptoms, including loss of appetite, lethargy, and transient severe anemia

34

with/without short-term fever, within 14 days post-infection (p.i.). By contrast, all three

35

monkeys in the CD3+ high group showed mild clinical symptoms such as mild fever and loss of

36

appetite within 4 days p.i. and then recovered. After a second inoculation with the isolate of

37

European lineage, three of four animals in both groups showed mild clinical symptoms but

38

recovered quickly. Hematological, immunological, and serological tests suggested that the

39

CD3+ high and low groups mounted different immune responses during the initial and second

40

infection stages. In both groups, anti-viral and innate immune responses were activated during

41

the early phase of infection and re-infection. However, in the CD3+ low group, inflammatory

42

responses, such as increased production of monocytes and neutrophils, were stronger than those

43

in the CD3+ high group, leading to more severe immunopathology and failure to eliminate the

44

virus. Taken together, the data suggest that the peripheral T lymphocyte population is associated

45

with pneumonia severity in cynomolgus monkeys experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Author summary

48

SARS-CoV-2 infection causes an illness with clinical manifestations that vary from

49

asymptomatic or mild to severe; examples include severe pneumonia and acute respiratory

50

distress syndrome. Lymphopenia, which is common in severe COVID-19 cases, is characterized

51

by markedly reduced numbers of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells.

52

Here, we showed that cynomolgus monkeys selected according to the T cell populations in

53

peripheral blood have different outcomes after experimental infection with SARS-CoV-2. These

54

findings will increase our understanding of disease pathogenesis and may facilitate the

55

development of animal models for vaccine evaluation.

Introduction

58

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel human coronavirus called severe

59

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global pandemic that began in

60

December, 2019 after cases of an unknown upper respiratory tract infection were reported in

61

Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [1-3]. The World Health Organization declared a global

62

pandemic on March 11, 2020; since then, the number of confirmed cases and the number of

63

deaths has increased rapidly, reaching over 1 million by the end of September 2020 [4].

64

SARS-CoV-2 causes an illness with clinical manifestations ranging from an

65

asymptomatic or mild infection to a serious illness (i.e., severe pneumonia and acute respiratory

66

distress syndrome) [3, 5, 6]. Pathological studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection of the

67

lower respiratory tract causes disease directly [7, 8]. In addition, high expression of

68

pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and IL-1 in serum from patients with severe

69

COVID-19 suggest that immunopathological damage caused by an over-exuberant host

70

response might contribute to poor outcomes [3, 9, 10]; this is similar to other coronavirus

71

infections such as SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [11-15]. Lymphopenia

72

is a common characteristic of severe COVID-19; severe cases show a marked reduction in the

73

numbers of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells [3, 9, 10].

74

Because T cells may mediate early innate immune responses to virus infection [16],

75

lymphopenia might be associated with severe disease. However, the role of T cell responses

76

during COVID-19 infection is unclear.

77

Several experimental models, including cats, chickens, dogs, ducks, ferrets, mice,

78

hamsters, macaque monkeys, and pigs, have been used to study COVID-19 [17, 18]. Cats,

79

ferrets, human ACE2 transgenic mice, hamsters, and monkeys are all susceptible to

80

SARS-CoV-2 after respiratory inoculation and all exhibit virus excretion from the upper

81

respiratory tract and/or intestine [19-26]. These animals develop acute pulmonary lesions after

82

inoculation with a high dose of virus, but clinical symptoms are mild. As in human cases of

83

SARS, advanced age correlates with adverse outcomes in mice and macaque monkeys [27, 28].

84

However, cynomolgus monkeys do not show age-dependent differences in severity after

85

experimental infection with SARS-CoV-2 [20].

86

Previously, we found that experimental infection of cynomolgus monkeys with

87

human viral pathogens resulted in a few severe cases [29]. Pathophysiological analysis

88

suggested that low populations of lymphocytes were related to the severe clinical symptoms

89

after experimental infection with virus. Thus, we speculated that low T cell populations in

90

peripheral blood might cause poor outcomes after SARS-CoV-2 infection of monkeys. To test

91

this hypothesis, we selected monkeys according to the T cell population in peripheral blood, and

92

infected them with an isolate of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from an individual who returned from

93

Wuhan at the end of January 2020. We then monitored the clinical symptoms, immune

94

responses, and lung pathology. In addition, we examined the effect of a previous infection with

95

SARS-CoV-2 by reinfecting monkeys with a heterologous strain to evaluate whether it

96

enhanced the symptoms of respiratory disease. We did this by re-challenging monkeys with

97

another isolate, a “S-G614 variant strain”, isolated from a returnee from Europe at the end of

98

March 2020. The results suggest that the peripheral T lymphocyte population in peripheral

99

blood is related to severity of pneumonia in cynomolgus monkeys experimentally infected with

100

SARS-CoV-2.

Results

103

Experimental infection of cynomolgus monkeys with SARS-CoV-2

104

An overview of the study design is shown in Figure 1A. Twenty-five female monkeys were

105

used. Body weight was measured (S1A Fig) and blood samples obtained for use in a

106

SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay. All animals except one had undetectable (<1:4) levels of

107

neutralizing antibodies; the exception had a titer of 1:4. The blood samples were also used to

108

investigate the number of lymphocytes and the population of CD3+ cells within the total

109

lymphocyte population (S1B Fig). After assigning animals into "CD3+ high" and "CD3+ low"

110

groups, six cynomolgus monkeys were selected according to body weight (only monkeys

111

weighing 3.5 kg or less were appropriate due to facility restrictions) and CD3+ cell count, and

112

then used in the infection experiments.

113

In this study, we used two isolates of SARS-CoV-2 from Japan: one of East Asian

114

lineage obtained at the end of January 2020, and another of European lineage obtained at end of

115

March 2020 (Table 1).

All monkeys showed reduced appetite, drank less, and became more lethargic within

134

4–10 days after the initial inoculation. Two animals (#5412 and #5417) from the CD3+ low

135

group showed lower clinical scores than that for the CD3+ high group from 5 to 14 days p.i.

136

Monkey #5412 became lethargic around 10 days after the initial inoculation but ate a piece of

137

fruit every day; therefore, we decided not to euthanize this animal. Indeed, the monkey

138

recovered from severe illness at around 14 days p.i. After the second inoculation with another

139

isolate of European lineage (hCoV-19/Japan/ QH-329-037/2020, referred to as QH-329-037) at

140

35 days after the initial inoculation (referred to as R0d in Fig. 1), all monkeys except #5405

141

showed a reduced clinical score and recovered within 1 week. No obvious body weight loss was

142

observed; indeed, monkey #5405 gained weight (S2A Fig). In all monkeys, body temperature

143

spiked 1 day after the initial inoculation but then returned to normal (the exception was monkey

144

#5405) (S3 Fig). Monkey #5405 continued to have a slightly higher temperature than before the

145

initial inoculation. At 1 day after the second inoculation, two monkeys from the CD3+ high

group (#5399 and #5403) showed a spike in body temperature. Biochemical markers (globulin:

148

and second inoculations (S2B Fig).

149

Two monkeys from the CD3+ low group showed low hemoglobin (HGB) levels: one at 7 days

150

(monkey #5417, at the time of planned autopsy) and one at 10 days (monkey #5412) after initial

151

inoculation (Fig. 2A). Red blood cell (RBC) counts and hematocrit levels were also low in these

152

monkeys (S4A Fig).

154

Immune responses in cynomolgus monkeys inoculated with SARS-CoV-2

155

All monkeys showed transient lymphopenia at 1 day p.i., after which lymphocyte

156

counts increased within the next 7 days (Fig. 2B). After the second inoculation, lymphocyte

157

counts in all monkeys decreased at Day 1 p.i. before recovering again. Mixed-effects models for

158

repeated measures analysis revealed significant differences in the number of lymphocytes

159

between the two groups. By contrast, monocyte counts after the first injection increased before

160

falling again within 7 days p.i. (Fig. 2B). After the second inoculation, monocyte counts did not

161

change significantly. Various changes in the numbers of other leukocytes, including neutrophils,

162

eosinophils, basophils, were seen during infection (S4B Fig).

163

Flow cytometry analysis revealed that changes in the overall lymphocyte count were

164

due to changes in the number of CD3+ T cells (Fig. 2C). In both groups, CD20+ B cell counts

165

dropped at 1 day p.i. and then increased gradually until 28 days p.i., but interestingly, there was

166

a significant difference between CD20+ B cell counts in the CD3+ high and low groups (Fig.

167

2C). After the second inoculation, the number of CD20+ B cells in both groups fell, before

increasing again. Three monkeys showed high CD16+ NK cell counts at 4 days after the initial

inoculation (Fig. 2C). After the second inoculation, CD16+ NK cells numbers in all monkeys

170

were higher than after the initial inoculation, although numbers remained low in monkey #5412.

171

There was a significant difference in the number of CD3+CD4+ T cells between the two groups

172

(S4C Fig). CD3+ cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cell counts, peaked at 7 days after the

173

initial inoculation, but cell numbers increased rapidly after the second inoculation.

174

Levels of IL-6, interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), monocyte chemotactic

175

protein-1 (MCP-1), IL-15, IL-2, and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (MIP-1β) in

176

serum peaked at 1 day after the initial inoculation; levels also increased at 1 day after the second

177

inoculation, although the increase was smaller in both groups (Fig. 2D and S5A Fig). Levels of

178

helper T cell (Th cell)-related cytokines, such as IL-12/23 (p40), interferon gamma (IFN-γ,

179

tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IL-13, IL-10, and IL-17 increased from Day 10 post-initial

180

inoculation, peaking at Day 14 or 21; expression increased rapidly (within 7 days) after the

181

second inoculation (Fig. 2D and S5B Fig). The kinetics of Th cell-related cytokine responses

182

(except IL-17) were faster in the CD3+ high group than in the CD3+ low group. Dynamic

183

changes in transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-α and IL-8 levels were also observed in

both groups during infection (S5C Fig).

189

and infectious virus was detected by culture with TMPRSS2-Vero E6 cells (Fig. 3). The result

192

Real-time RT-PCR confirmed viral replication in the upper respiratory tract and intestine by

193

detecting viral subgenomic mRNAs in swab samples that were positive for viral RNA [30].

194

Actively-infected cells were detected in nasal swabs from two monkeys (#5403 and #5404) and

195

in a rectal swab from one monkey (#5412) (Fig. 3 and S6 Fig). After the second inoculation,

196

none of the monkeys excreted infectious virus, although viral subgenomic mRNA was detected

197

in nasal (#5403) and rectal (#5412) swabs (Fig. 3).

198
199

Seroconversion after experimental infection with SARS-CoV-2

200

No monkeys, including #5404 and #5417 euthanized on Day 7 p.i., showed

201

seroconversion within 7 days p.i. Neutralizing antibodies were detected from 10 days (monkey

202

#5399 in the CD3+ high group) or 14 days (the other three monkeys in both groups) after the

203

initial inoculation, peaking at 21 days p.i. in the CD3+ high group and 28 days p.i. in the CD3+

204

low group (Fig. 4A). Within 35 days p.i. (35d/R0d in Fig. 4A), the neutralizing antibody titer in

205

monkeys #5399 and #5403 from the CD3+ high group fell slightly; overall, the antibody titers

206

were higher in the CD3+ low group than in the CD3+ high group. After the second inoculation,

207

neutralizing antibody titers increased rapidly at 4 days (R4d) p.i., peaking at 1:640 at 7 days

208

(R7d) p.i., in all monkeys from both groups. Monkeys #5403 and #5412 were euthanized at R7

209

days p.i. After this time point, the titers in monkeys #5399 and #5405 fell slightly to 1:320 at 14

210

days. Sidak's multiple comparisons test after application of a mixed-effects models for repeated

211

measures analysis revealed a significant difference in neutralizing antibody titers between the

two groups. Serum obtained from the monkeys showed cross-reactivity with both strains of

214

We also used in-house IgM, IgA, and IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISAs) to

215

examine antibody isotypes and their binding to the spike (S), receptor binding domain (RBD),

216

and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Fig. 4B). At 7 or 10 days p.i., S-, RBD-, and N protein-specific

217

IgM, IgA, and IgG antibody titers increased in both groups. Spearman’s correlation analysis

218

revealed that the IgA and IgG responses correlated with the neutralizing antibody response (R >

219

0.8). High levels of IgG antibodies specific for the S and RBD proteins were observed in

220

monkey #5412, which showed prolonged excretion of infectious virus from the intestine after

221

the initial inoculation.

223

Transcriptomic analyses of peripheral whole blood from monkeys inoculated with

224

SARS-CoV-2

225

Transcriptomic analyses were conducted using RNA extracted from peripheral whole

226

blood samples collected at different time points: before initial inoculation (Day 0), after initial

227

inoculation (Days 1, 4, and 7), before the second inoculation (R0), and after the second

228

inoculation (R1, R4, and R7). Gene expression was compared between samples collected from

229

animals before (Day 0) and after (Days 1, 4, 7, R0, R1, R4, and R7) virus inoculation to identify

230

differentially expressed genes (S7A Fig). The results revealed that 331 genes were upregulated

231

significantly, while 176 genes were downregulated significantly, after virus infection. Among

232

the 507 differentially expressed genes, 78 were related to the immune response (S7B Fig). Next,

233

we conducted gene set enrichment analyses using samples collected from the CD3+ high and

234

CD3+ low groups after (Days 1, 4, 7, R0, R1, R4, and R7) virus infection (Fig. 5A). Expression

of genes encoding neutrophil-, monocyte-, and inflammatory signal-related modules were

236

downregulated to a greater extent in the CD3+ high group than in the CD3+ low group (green

237

dots in Fig. 5A), whereas expression of genes encoding B cell-related modules was upregulated

238

to a greater extent in the CD3+ high group than in the CD3+ low group (gray dots in Fig. 5A).

239

Furthermore, to evaluate differences in transcriptomic profiles over time, we conducted gene set

240

enrichment analyses at baseline (before virus infection, Day 0) and at different time points after

241

virus infection (Days 1, 4, 7, R0, R1, R4, and R7) (Fig. 5B). The results revealed significant

242

upregulation of genes encoding innate anti-viral immune system-related modules (yellow dots

243

in Fig. 5B) on Days 1 and 4 in both the CD3+ high and CD3+ low groups. Of note, upregulation

of genes encoding inflammation-related modules (green & red dots in Fig. 5B) and

downregulation of genes encoding T cell-related modules (black dots in Fig. 5B) were more

prominent in the CD3+ low group than in the CD3+ high group. Upregulation of innate immune

247

response-related genes was observed following re-infection with virus, although no alteration in

248

expression of T cell- and B cell-related genes was observed. Overall, expression of more

249

immune response-related modules was altered significantly in the CD3+ low group compared

250

with the CD3+ high group, suggesting a difference in the magnitude of the immune response

251

between the two groups following virus infection.

At the experimental end-point, tissue samples were also collected to detect viral

255

RNA, subgenomic mRNA, and infectious virus (Fig. 6 and S6B Fig). Two monkeys (#5404 and

in the upper and lower lobe of the lungs. At 7 and 14 days after the second inoculation (R7d and

258

R14d), two monkeys (#5412 and #5405) from the CD3+ low group had viral RNA and/or

259

subgenomic mRNA in the lower lobe of the lungs and in the trachea. Monkey #5412 excreted

260

the virus in rectal swabs (Fig. 3) and had detectable viral RNA and/or subgenomic mRNA in the

261

large intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes at 7 days after the second inoculation. High levels of

262

viral RNA were detected in the tonsil and subcarinal lymph nodes of monkeys in both the CD3+

263

high and low groups at various time points. No infectious virus was isolated from tissue samples

264

using TMPRSS2/VeroE6 cells. Because it was difficult to distinguish cytopathic effects (CPE)

265

from cytotoxicity caused by the tissue homogenate, we performed blind passage of

266

TMPRSS2/VeroE6 cells in the presence of culture supernatant from the first inoculation plus

267

10% tissue homogenate; however, there were no distinct CPEs within 5 days p.i., after the

268

second blind passage.

269

As mentioned above, we used a heterologous strain of the virus for the second

270

infection. To identify single nucleotide variations and the major population of virus in monkey

271

tissues, we used the next generation sequencer MiSeq to obtain the entire length of the viral

272

genome. Thirteen RNA samples obtained from tonsil, mesenteric lymph nodes, and lung tissues

273

from infected monkeys were used for analysis; however, four samples did not meet the quality

274

standards. The read number obtained for six samples of tonsil and lung returned only partial

275

viral genome sequences (S2 Table). In the end, only three samples were suitable for genome

276

sequencing; the sequences obtained from these samples were compared with the Wuhan-Hu-1

277

genome sequence (accession no. MN908947.3) as a reference (Table 2). The sequence data

286

The results revealed that the viral genome obtained from the tonsil of monkey #5404

287

after initial inoculation did not harbor any mutations (threshold = 50%). However, the viral

288

genome isolated from the lung of monkey #5412 harbored nine single nucleotide

289

polymorphisms (SNPs), including seven silent point mutations, one deletion resulting in a

290

frameshift mutation in the ORF1ab region, and a nonsynonymous mutation in ORF1b. The most

291

common base change was C > T. In addition, the genome isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes

292

from monkey #5412 harbored three SNPs, including two nonsynonymous mutations in the

293

ORF1a region and a synonymous mutation in the S region. The major sequence in these two

294

isolates was derived from WK-521, suggesting that the original inoculum replicated and resided

295

in the respiratory tract and intestine of monkey #5412, even after the second inoculation with

296

the heterologous strain. The viral genome obtained from the tonsil of monkey #5403 after the

297

second inoculation harbored a D614G mutation in the S region, suggesting the presence of

298

QH-329-037 in the tonsil after the 2nd inoculum (S3 Table). The viral genome also obtained

299

from the tonsil of #5405 after the second inoculation harbored a D614G mutation in the S

300

region, suggesting the presence of QH-329-037 in the tonsil. Interestingly, the genome obtained

301

from the subcarinal lymph node of monkey #5405 did not harbor the D614G mutation,

302

suggesting that the original inoculum was maintained in the accessory lymph node of the lungs.

303

These results suggest that the initially inoculated virus (WK-521) was maintained in the lungs

304

and/or accessory lymph nodes, and that the second inoculated virus (QH-329-037) was

305

eliminated from the lungs of these monkeys soon after the second inoculation.

Gross pathology of lungs from monkeys at each end-point is shown in Fig. 7A.

310

Obvious gross lung lesions observed in monkey #5417 at 7 days after the initial inoculation

311

(Fig. 7A, red and white arrows). After the second inoculation, enlargement of the subcarinal

312

lymph nodes was seen in three monkeys, except #5405 (Fig. 7A, yellow arrows).

313

Histopathological analysis revealed varying degrees of alveolar damage in monkeys #5404 and

314

#5417 at 7 days after the initial inoculation (Fig. 7B). Lung tissue from monkey #5404 showed

315

multifocal, slight to mild, interstitial pneumonia, with mononuclear cell aggregates in the

316

alveoli (Fig. 7B, upper row). Monkey #5417 developed more severe interstitial pneumonia, with

317

pulmonary edema comprising degenerated cells and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (Fig. 7B,

318

lower row). Proliferating type II cells overlying the pulmonary walls were observed within the

319

lesions. CD3+ lymphocytes and CD68+ macrophages were present in the alveoli. The lesions in

320

the lungs of monkey #5417 contained predominantly CD68+ macrophages rather than CD3+

321

cells (Fig. 7C).

322

Double immunohistochemistry revealed high expression of ACE2 on the surface of the

323

pulmonary bronchi, but staining was very weak in the alveoli (S8 Fig, upper row); there was no

324

merging of virus antigen (S8 Fig, brown) and ACE2 (S8 Fig, green) signals in either area. In

325

addition, ACE2 was strongly expressed by hyperplastic type II pneumocytes in the pulmonary

326

lesions (S8 Fig, lower row).

327

Monkeys euthanized after the second inoculation had slight focal interstitial

328

inflammation, with macrophages and lymphocytes in the alveoli but no evidence of viral

329

antigens (S9 Fig).

Supplementary figure 10 shows representative examples of histopathology of the

331

lungs and extrapulmonary organs. Hemophagocytes were seen in the alveoli and lymph nodes

332

from monkey #5417, which showed severe anemia at 7 days p.i. (S10A Fig). Diffuse

333

eosinophilic and plasma cell infiltration was seen in the mesenteric lymph nodes, small

intestines and large intestine from monkey #5412, which showed prolonged viral excretion after

Discussion
In our previous study of the SARS-CoV HKU39849 isolate, we inoculated six

339

cynomolgus monkeys via the intranasal, intragastric, intravenous, or intratracheal routes and

340

found that only intratracheal inoculation with 108 TCID50 virus in 5 mL of medium induced

341

acute pneumonia [31]. A low dose (103 TCID50 in 3.5 mL) administered intranasally failed to

342

establish an infection, whereas a high dose (106 TCID50 in 3.5 mL) succeeded; indeed, infection

343

was detected in nasal and throat swabs within 7 days post-inoculation. In addition, an

344

epidemiological study suggests that COVID-19-associated conjunctivitis is a possible

345

transmission route for SARS-CoV-2 [32]. Therefore, in this study we used a combined

346

inoculation protocol comprising the nasal, intratracheal, and conjunctive routes, and used a high

347

titer of SARS-CoV-2. Shed virus was detected in the upper respiratory and intestinal tracts of

348

infected monkeys, but not consistently (even in nasal and throat swabs); however, one monkey

349

from the CD3+ low group showed prolonged shedding of virus in rectal swabs. Other macaque

350

models infected with clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 show similar results [20, 33]. One of

351

these studies showed that viral RNA levels in throat and nasal swabs from young cynomolgus

352

monkeys peaked at Day 1 or 2 post-inoculation; however, they peaked at Day 4 in older

353

monkeys [20]. A few conjunctival swab samples were positive for viral RNA, but not for

354

subgenomic mRNA; in addition, none of the monkeys developed obvious conjunctivitis during

355

the observation period in this study. Taken together, these data suggest that a combination of the

356

intranasal and intratracheal routes (at least) might be appropriate for vaccine studies. In

357

addition, a previous study suggests that the presence of subgenomic mRNA in throat and/or

358

nasopharyngeal swabs should be considered when testing vaccine efficacy [34]. Our own study

359

using young adult cynomolgus monkeys suggests that peripheral T lymphocytes (CD3+) are

360

associated with pneumonia severity. Thus, it is important to consider both the age of the

361

individual and T cell population when selecting animals for vaccine studies [18].

362

Peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets in humans are affected by factors such as

363

gender, age, and ethnicity, and by lifestyle factors such as stress [35]. In this study, we used

364

young healthy monkeys, which showed a wide range of peripheral CD3+ cells. The immune

365

system of non-human primates may also be affected by environmental and physiological

366

conditions [36, 37].

367

According to an epidemiological study of COVID-19, about 10% of the global

368

population may be infected by October 2020; however, most infected people are asymptomatic

369

or mildly symptomatic [38]. That said, some people develop severe pneumonia resulting in

370

respiratory failure, sepsis, and even death (the current fatality rate is 0.15–0.20%). Similar to

371

SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, older age is a risk factor for severe SARS-CoV-2. Whereas

372

absolute lymphopenia is not specific to COVID-19, low CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell counts

373

in peripheral blood have been observed in severe cases of COVID-19 [39]. These cases also

374

present with comorbidities such as chronic underlying diseases. Zheng et al. reported that the

375

total CD3+ count is lower in both mild and severe cases of COVID-19 than in healthy controls,

376

but that CD3+, CD8+, and NK cell counts are significantly lower in severe cases [40]. In

377

addition, functional exhaustion (e.g., reduction of CD107a expression and IFN-γ, IL-2, and

378

TNF-α production by CTLs and NK cells) occurred in severe cases.

379

Murine models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection suggest that failure to

380

induce an early IFN-I response leads to severe pathology and disease [41, 42]. Sera from

381

hospitalized COVID-19 patients show reduced IFN-I and -III levels in response to

382

SARS-CoV-2, but a significant increase in inflammatory chemokines and cytokines [43]. In the

383

current study, transcriptome analysis revealed that innate anti-viral immune responses occurred

384

during the early phase of infection in both the CD3+ high and low groups. In both groups, IRF2,

385

which regulates type I IFN production, was activated during the early phase of infection and

386

upon re-infection. However, in the CD3+ low group, inflammation overwhelmed the T cell

387

response. This is supported by the kinetics of T cell-associated cytokine and chemokine

388

production in monkey sera. Thus, a strong inflammatory response, coupled with a weak/delayed

389

T cell response, was critical for the development of more severe SARS-CoV-2 in the CD3+ low

390

group. By contrast, an early type I IFN-related innate immune response controlled viral

391

replication and dispersion at an early stage in the CD3+ high group.

392

On Days 7–10 after the initial inoculation, two monkeys from the CD3+ low group

393

became lethargic, with decreased hemoglobin levels and RBC counts suggestive of severe

394

anemia. In some cases of COVID-19, low hemoglobin levels indicate anemia [2, 44-46]. The

395

mechanism underlying anemia in COVID-19 patients is unclear; however, virus infection and

396

inflammation impact iron metabolism [47-49]. Levels of serum ferritin, an intracellular protein

397

that maintains iron levels, mirror the degree of inflammation in infectious diseases. In this

398

study, we did not measure ferritin levels in blood from infected monkeys; however, studies

399

show that hospitalized COVID-19 patients have high ferritin levels [2, 46]. The impact of

400

anemia and high ferritin levels on outcome after SARS-CoV-2 infection is unclear [45]. In this

401

study, one of two monkeys (#5417) with anemia that was sacrificed for planned autopsy showed

402

severe acute pneumonia and hemophagocytes in the cervical lymph nodes. Another (#5412)

403

showed extreme lethargy and anemia on Day 10; however, the monkey ate a piece of apple

404

despite showing loss of appetite. Therefore, we continued to observe this animal until recovery

405

within 14 days p.i., at which point seroconversion occurred. Monkey #5412 showed a low

406

clinical score and excreted infectious virus from intestine for 3 weeks.

407

Pathological evaluation revealed varying degrees of virus infection and host response

408

in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected monkeys at 7 days p.i. Morphologically, SARS-CoV-2

409

replicated in epithelial cells in the pulmonary bronchus and alveoli of monkey #5404, resulting

410

in mild pneumonia. Similar to SARS-CoV infection, expression of ACE2 and SARS-CoV

411

antigen-positive cells did not overlap [50]. In a severe case (monkey #5417), pulmonary edema

412

was observed, suggesting severe damage to pneumocytes. The pathological features were early

413

stage diffuse alveolar damage, with hyaline membranes and a few multinucleated giant cells,

414

similar to human cases of SARS and COVID-19 [7, 9, 11, 51-53]. Activated macrophages

415

rather than lymphocytes were seen in the alveoli of monkey #5417, suggesting that massive

416

inflammatory reactions were induced in the lungs. Lack of an active immune response and

417

epithelial regeneration results in a poor outcome [51]. In this study, we used young monkeys;

418

many regenerated type II cells were seen in the lungs of monkey #5417, and high levels of

419

seroconversion occurred in monkey #5412, even from CD3+ low groups.

420

Most infected people are asymptomatic or show mild symptoms during SARS-CoV-2 infection;

421

thus some researchers wonder whether SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers protective immunity

422

against re-infection [54]. A rhesus macaque model clarified that SARS-CoV-2 infection results

423

in protective immunity against re-infection [55]. The latest study reporting human cases of

424

COVID-19 indicate that the neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 last only for a few

425

months [56]. The results of the present study suggest the magnitude of neutralizing antibody

426

titers in infected monkeys is dependent on disease severity, similar to human cases [56]. In

427

addition, these monkeys developed a rapid immune response against a second infection with

428

another challenge strain. NK cell and IL-17 responses, suggesting involvement of Th17 cells,

429

were stronger after the second infection than after the initial infection. Transcriptome analysis

430

revealed that upregulation of innate immune responses, rather than T and B cell responses, in

431

the CD3+ low group contributed to a marked reduction in viral replication and less severe

432

pathology, even after a second infection. Seroconversion in monkeys is common after acute

433

virus infections; indeed, we found virus-specific IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies in the sera. IgM

434

antibodies appeared together with IgG and, later, IgA; however, titers decreased within 3 weeks

435

after inoculation. This result is similar to that of a human cohort study reporting co-induction of

436

IgM and IgG during SARS-CoV infection [57]. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibodies are

437

predominantly specific for the S-/RBD- and N proteins. IgG levels in symptomatic groups are

438

significantly higher than those in asymptomatic groups during the acute phase [58].

439

Asymptomatic cases also show lower levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Similar to

440

human cases of COVID-19, our monkeys showed different immune responses and even

441

seroconversion. After the second inoculation, all monkeys generated high titers of virus-specific

442

IgA and IgG, suggesting re-infection.

443

In this study, we used two clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2, one from East Asia and

444

one from Europe. After identification of the first case of COVID-19 in Japan on January 15,

445

2020, an epidemiological study of the SARS-CoV-2 genome revealed that the primary clusters

446

identified in January and February in Japan were related to the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolates from China

447

[59]. Soon after the primary wave from China, we faced a second wave of COVID-19 cases

448

caused by lineages imported by returnees from Europe and North America. Thus, we based the

449

infection experiments in this study on the current situation in Japan. We found that previous

450

infection with a Wuhan-Hu-1-related isolate of SARS-CoV-2 led to a less severe illness upon

451

re-infection with a heterologous strain (an S-G614 variant from Europe).

452

We also determined the mutation patterns in SARS-CoV-2 isolates from the lung of

453

monkey #5412 at 6 weeks after the initial inoculation. The most common base changes were C >

454

T, which were synonymous variants in the ORF1ab region of the monkey isolate. This

455

nucleotide substitution is common in SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from humans [60, 61]. C

456

> T transitions are thought to be induced by cytosine deaminases [60].

457

Taken together, the data presented herein suggest that a low CD3+ T cell count in

458

peripheral blood might be an important risk factor for more severe COVID-19. We

459

acknowledge that the study has some limitations; the small number of monkeys (due to ethical

460

reasons) in particular. However, the data suggest that the peripheral T lymphocyte population is

461

associated with severity of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Biological safety

486

All work with SARS-CoV-2 was conducted under biosafety level-3 (BSL-3)

487

conditions in the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan. All experimental animals were

488

handled in a biosafety level 3 animal facility in accordance with the guidelines of this

489

committee (approval no. 19-60, 20-1). Animals were contained in a glovebox system in the

490

ABSL-3 facility during experimental infection. All personnel used respiratory protection when

491

handling infectious samples (respirator type N95). Surface disinfection was performed using

492

80% ethanol, while liquids, solid waste, cages, and animal wastes were steam sterilized in an

493

autoclave.

Whole-genome amplification of strain QH-329-037 was carried out using the

507

modified version of ARTIC Network’s protocol for SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing by

508

replacing some of the primers for multiplex PCR [63]. A next generation sequencing (NGS)

509

library was constructed using the QIAseq FX DNA library kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and

510

sequenced using the NextSeq 500 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). NGS reads were mapped

511

to the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome sequence (GenBank accession no.

529

SARS-CoV-2. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) blood samples were used for

530

hematologic tests and flow cytometry analysis. Six monkeys (young adult females, 5 years old)

531

were selected for experimental infection with SARS-CoV-2. At 14 days before inoculation with

532

the virus, a small implantable thermo logger (DST micro-T: 8.3 × 25.4 mm; Star-oddi,

533

Gardabaer, Iceland) was set intraperitoneally under ketamine anesthesia. The loggers were

534

retrieved at necropsy. Six monkeys were transferred to the animal facility at biosafety level 3

535

and allowed to acclimatize for 1 week. The animals were observed daily for clinical signs

536

(dietary intake, including pellets and fruits, drinking, attitude in front of regular observers, and

537

stool consistency) using a standardized scoring system until the end of the study. Scoring was

538

performed as follows: daily intake of pellets (0–5), fruits including orange and apple (0–5), and

539

drinking water (0–5), attitude in front of regular observers (i.e., standing up, show interest in the

540

outside, getting attention, intimidation, up and down movement: 0–5), stool consistency (color,

541

stiffness, form, volume, frequency: 0–5). The total score was the sum of all five component

542

scores.

543

The six monkeys were anaesthetized by intramuscular injection of a mixture of 50

544

mg/mL ketamine and 20 mg/mL xylazine (2:1; 0.2 mL/kg). After collecting samples, including

545

blood and swabs, monkeys were inoculated with an isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (WK-521) via the

anesthesia. Two animals were euthanized at 7 days post-initial inoculation, and four animals

552

were re-inoculated with another isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (QH-329-037) at 35 days p.i. After

553

re-inoculation, two animals were euthanized at 7 days post-second inoculation (R7 days p.i.),

554

Virus titration

558

Tissue samples in Lysing Matrix tubes containing beads (Lysing Matrix A; MP

559

Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) were homogenized using a mini Bead-Beater (Biospec Products,

560

Bartlesville, OK) at 100 rpm for 30 sec (twice), and then diluted in 2×DMEM to yield 10%

561

homogenates. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min at 4℃, the supernatants were used for

562

titration on VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. Swab samples were also used for titration. Inoculated cells

563

were assessed for CPE at 5 days p.i. The detection limit was 101.5 TCID50/mL 10% tissue

580

Some samples containing high viral RNA copy numbers were sent for viral sequence

581

analysis by gene analysis services (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). The next generation sequencing

582

(NGS) library was prepared using the SuperScript IV First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo

583

Fisher Scientific), Q5 Hot Start DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), and

584

the QIAseq FX DNA Library Kit (Qiagen). The viral genome region was amplified specifically

585

by multiplex PCR [63], and the entire sequence of the viral genome was obtained using the next

586

generation sequencer MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with a read length of 250 nt. FASTQ

587

data were imported into the CLC Genomics Workbench (version 11, Qiagen), and the sequence

588

reads were aligned to the reference sequence Wuhan-Hu-1 (accession no. MN908947.3). The

616

Antigen retrieval from formalin-fixed monkey tissue sections was performed by autoclaving in

617

retrieval solution (pH 6.0; Nichirei Biosciences) at 121°C for 10 min. Hyper-immune rabbit

618

serum raised against the GST-tagged N protein of SARS-CoV-2 (produced in-house) was used

619

as the primary antibody to detect viral antigens. Peroxidase activity was detected with

620

3,3’-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Hematoxylin was used for

621

counterstaining. The polyclonal antibody against GST-tagged N protein of SARS-CoV-2 was

622

prepared as follows: first, the recombinant N protein was constructed by inserting the N gene of

623

SARS-CoV-2 into the pGEX-6P vector (GenScript Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Next, the amino acid

624

sequence was optimized to the bacterial codon. The vector was then used to transform

625

Escherichia coli strain BL21 (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). Expression of the GST-N protein of

626

SARS-CoV-2 was induced by isopropyl-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (0.3 mM IPTG, Takara

627

Bio). The cell pellets were sonicated, and the inclusion bodies containing the fusion protein

628

were collected. The fusion proteins were extracted from SDS-PAGE gels after reverse staining

629

(AE-1310 EzStain Reverse, Atto, Tokyo, Japan), concentrated using a spin column (Pall

630

centrifugal device 0.2 µm, Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY), and diluted in PBS using

Amicon Ultra-0.5mL Centrifugal Filters (Ultracel-50k). Two New Zealand White rabbits (1.5

632

kg < body weight; female; SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) were immunized (four times at 2-week

633

intervals) with the purified protein conjugated to TiterMax Gold (Sigma-Aldrich). Rabbits were

634

sacrificed under excess anesthesia with pentobarbital sodium (64.8 mg/kg), and whole blood

635

was collected by cardiac puncture using an 18 G needle. After separating sera by centrifugation,

636

IgG was purified from the rabbit serum using a Melon Gel IgG Spin Purification Kit (Thermo

Neutralization assay

640

During the observation period, blood was obtained under anesthesia with ketamine.

641

Serum samples were collected by centrifugation and inactivated by heating to 56C for 30 min.

642

Serum samples were titrated (in duplicate) from 1:10 to 1:1280 in 96-well plates and reacted

643

with 100 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2 (WK-521 or QH-329-037) at 37C for 1 h before addition of

644

VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells. Cells were incubated at 37C for 5 days and examined twice for

were coated overnight at 4℃ with 50 ng recombinant protein in coating buffer (pH 9.6). The

653

serum samples were serially diluted (4-fold from 1:400 to 1:409600) in 5% skim milk in PBS

654

(pH 7.2) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) (PBS-T). The well contents were

RNA sequencing and data analyses

683

Whole blood was collected from animals at multiple time points using PAXgene

684

Blood RNA Tubes (PreAnalytiX, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland). Tubes were frozen at -80℃

685

until RNA extraction. RNA was extracted using PAXgene Blood RNA Kits (PreAnalytiX) and

686

shipped to Macrogen Corp. Japan (Kyoto, Japan) for NGS sequencing. Next, cDNA libraries

687

were prepared using a TruSeq Stranded Total RNA LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) in

688

accordance with the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Sample Prep Guide (Part #15031048 Rev. E

689

protocol). Next, the cDNA libraries were paired-end sequenced (read length = 101 bp) on a

690

NovaSeq6000 sequencer (Illumina). Raw FASTQ files were quality checked using fastqc

691

v0.11.8 [67], and low-quality bases from paired reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic v0.39

692

[68]. Paired reads were aligned to the Macaca fascicularis genome (version 5.0, Ensembl release

693

101) using the STAR aligner v2.7.3a [69] and default settings. Read fragments (paired reads

694

only) were quantified per gene per sample using featureCounts v1.6.0 [70]. All raw RNA seq

695

fastq files were uploaded to the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DRA accession number:

696

DRA010881). All functional analyses of transcriptomic data were performed in the R statistical

697

environment (v3.6.2). Significantly differentially expressed genes between samples collected

698

before and after virus infection were identified using DESeq2 v1.26.0 [71] with default settings,

699

and a minimum adjusted P-value significance threshold of 0.05. Volcano plots were created

700

from shrunken log2-fold change values for each gene, calculated by DESeq2 (shrinkage type:

701

normal). For the heatmaps, DESeq2-normalized counts per gene were plotted using the heatmap

702

package [72]. Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA) were conducted using tmod v0.44 [73],

703

with count data normalized with the voom function within the limma package v3.42.2 [74].

Fig. 1. Study design and clinical scores in cynomolgus monkeys after inoculation of

1054

SARS-CoV-2. Study outline (A). Black arrows indicate preparation for experimental

1055

infection. Six 5-year-old monkeys were selected from 25 monkeys. Red and yellow arrow heads

1056

indicate virus inoculation. After assigning animals to "CD3+ high" and "CD3+ low" groups, six

1057

cynomolgus monkeys were infected with an isolate from East Asia (WK-521 strain) via a

1058

combination of intranasal (0.125 mL, sprayed into the right nostril), conjunctival (0.1 mL,

1059

dropped into the right eye), and intratracheal (1.275 mL virus solution plus 2 mL saline via a

1060

catheter) inoculation. After the initial inoculation, body weight was measured, and samples were

1061

collected at various time points (blue arrows). Red arrows denote autopsy at 7 or 14 days after

1062

the first or second inoculation (n = 1 per group at each time point). Four monkeys received a

1063

second inoculation with an isolate from Europe (QH-329-037 strain). (B) Clinical scores of

1064

cynomolgus monkeys inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Cool (blue and aqua) and warm (red and

1065

orange) colored symbols and lines indicate data from the CD3+ high group and CD3+ low

1066

group animals, respectively. After transfer to the ABSL3 facility, the monkeys were observed

1067

once daily for clinical signs and scored accordingly. Black dashed lines on the horizontal axis

1068

indicate the range of clinical scores recorded during the ABSL3 facility acclimatization period.
