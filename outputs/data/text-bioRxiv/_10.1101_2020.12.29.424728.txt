Abstract

23

Treatment of the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) has become an important part of rescuing

24

hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Here, we systematically explored the transcriptional regulators

25

of inflammatory cytokines involved in the COVID-19 CRS to identify candidate transcription

26

factors (TFs) for therapeutic targeting using approved drugs. We integrated a resource of TF-

27

cytokine gene interactions with single-cell RNA-seq expression data from bronchoalveolar

28

lavage fluid cells of COVID-19 patients. We found 581 significantly correlated interactions,

29

between 95 TFs and 16 cytokines upregulated in the COVID-19 patients, that may contribute to

30

pathogenesis of the disease. Among these, we identified 19 TFs that are targets of FDA

31

approved drugs. We investigated the potential therapeutic effect of 10 drugs and 25 drug

32

combinations on inflammatory cytokine production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which

33

revealed two drugs that inhibited cytokine production and numerous combinations that show

34

synergistic efficacy in downregulating cytokine production. Further studies of these candidate

35

repurposable drugs could lead to a therapeutic regimen to treat the CRS in COVID-19 patients.

Introduction

38

Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 betacoronavirus strain,

39

has led to over 80 million confirmed cases and 1.7 million deaths worldwide, since its first

40

reported case in December 2019 (1). Most COVID-19 cases are either asymptomatic or cause

41

only mild disease (2). However, a considerable number of patients develop severe respiratory

42

illnesses manifested in fever and pneumonia, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome

43

(ARDS) and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (3). CRS is an acute systemic inflammatory

44

response characterized by the rapid and excessive release of inflammatory cytokines.

45

Uncontrolled CRS results in systemic hyperinflammation and can lead to life-threatening multi-

46

organ failure (3).

47

There is an urgent need for therapies to treat the CRS in COVID-19 patients. While

48

government agencies and private companies have accelerated procedures to develop and

49

distribute COVID-19 vaccines, it will take a year or longer for the population to be vaccinated.

50

Additionally, a significant portion of the population may not get vaccinated due to reduced

51

compliance and limited access to vaccines, or may not mount a proper protective response

52

(e.g., immunodeficient patients). Furthermore, whether the vaccines generate a long-lasting

53

protective response in all patients is still unknown. Since drug development and approval may

54

take years, drug repurposing of already approved drugs is an efficient approach to identify

55

alternative therapeutic options. At present, three repurposed drugs, remdesivir, dexamethasone,

56

and baricitinib (in combination with remdesivir), have been found to benefit COVID-19 patients

57

in large, controlled, randomized, clinical trials (4-6). Dexamethasone, which acts as an agonist

58

of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR, also known as NR3C1) transcription factor (TF), is an anti-

59

inflammatory corticosteroid (7). Indeed, corticosteroids have been shown to suppress CRS (8),

60

and NR3C1 has been shown to transcriptionally downregulate many inflammatory cytokines

61

overexpressed in COVID-19 patients, such as CCL2, IL1B, and IL6 (9, 10). Baricitinib, a non-

62

steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, acts as a janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor (4). The JAK-signal

63

transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway leads to the transcription

64

of inflammatory cytokines, thus inhibition of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway decreases the

65

production of inflammatory cytokines. Despite the efficacy of these drugs in reducing COVID-19

66

mortality, the effect-size is modest, suggesting the need for additional drugs or combinations to

67

treat the CRS in COVID-19 patients. Although antibodies are well-proven strategies to block

68

cytokine activity, approved antibodies are available for only nine cytokines (DrugBank, (11)),

69

specifically TNF and various interleukins (ILs). However, the COVID-19 CRS primarily manifests

70

in overproduction of chemokines (i.e. CCLs and CXCLs)(12, 13). Thus, as cytokines are highly

71

transcriptionally regulated, there is great potential in exploring other transcriptional regulators of

72

inflammatory cytokines involved in the COVID-19 CRS that can be targeted with approved

73

drugs.

74

Here, we systematically studied the transcriptional regulators of inflammatory cytokines

75

involved in the COVID-19 CRS to identify candidate TFs for therapeutic targeting using

76

approved drugs. We integrated a resource of empirically identified TF-cytokine gene interactions

77

with single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) expression data from COVID-19 patients to reveal

78

correlated TF-cytokine gene interactions that may contribute to pathogenesis of the disease. We

79

identified candidate TFs that could be targeted using approved drugs and investigated the

80

potential therapeutic effect of 10 drugs on the expression of cytokines upregulated in COVID-19

81

patients. We also assayed 25 drug combinations and found numerous combinations that show

82

promising synergistic efficacy in downregulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines. In

83

summary, the present study provides a network-based approach focusing on the transcriptional

84

regulators of inflammatory cytokines to identify candidate repurposable drugs to treat the

85

COVID-19 CRS.

Results

88

Delineation of a COVID-19 cytokine gene regulatory network

89

We hypothesized that transcriptional regulators whose expressions are significantly correlated

90

with the expression of cytokines upregulated in COVID-19 patients may play a role in the

91

pathogenesis of the COVID-19 CRS. To identify TF-cytokine pairs correlated in expression, we

92

integrated a published resource of 2,260 empirically tested TF-cytokine gene interactions

93

(CytReg v2)(14) with publicly available scRNA-seq data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)

94

cells from nine COVID-19 patients (GSE145926)(12) and three healthy controls (GSE145926

95

and GSE128033)(12, 15). Unsupervised clustering analysis of the scRNA-seq data revealed

96

distinct clusters of ciliated epithelial cells, secretory epithelial cells, natural killer cells,

97

neutrophils, macrophages, myeloid dendritic cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CD4 T cells,

98

CD8 T cells, B cells, and plasma cells, identified by signature genes (Supplementary Figure 1A-

99

B). For each cell type, we identified cytokines that were significantly (Padj<0.05) upregulated in

100

the COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (Supplementary Table S1), and then

101

determined the TFs in CytReg v2 reported to functionally regulate or bind to the transcriptional

102

control regions of these cytokines. To prioritize TFs that may have a role in the pathogenesis of

103

the COVID-19 CRS, we generated gene regulatory networks for TF-cytokine interactions that

104

are significantly correlated across single cells in each cell type (Supplementary Table S1) in the

105

COVID-19 patient BALF samples.

106

In total, we identified 581 significantly correlated interactions between 95 TFs and 16

107

cytokines upregulated in the COVID-19 patients. Strikingly, 567 (97.6%) interactions displayed a

108

positive correlation, suggesting that the cytokine upregulation is primarily mediated through

109

activation by transcriptional activators rather than through de-repression by transcriptional

110

repressors. The transcriptional activation could be a result of activated signaling pathways

111

impinging on the TFs or increased TF expression. Indeed, 89 (93.7%) TFs were significantly

112

upregulated in at least one cell type in the COVID-19 patients, many of which are known to be

113

activated by signaling pathways in inflammation. Consistent with this, TFs in 336 of 395 (85.1%)

114

positively correlated interactions that have a regulatory function reported in CytReg v2 were

115

reported to activate expression of the target cytokine gene in various inflammatory contexts

116

(14). This provides evidence that TFs displaying a positive correlation in the COVID-19 cytokine

117

gene regulatory network can functionally activate expression of the target cytokine gene.

118

TFs that have widespread interactions across many cell types likely play important roles

119

in regulating the COVID-19 CRS. Notably, IRF2, IRF7, and STAT1, were upregulated and

120

positively correlated with multiple cytokines in all cell types. IRFs and STATs play prominent

121

roles in viral infection by regulating interferon (IFN) production and response pathways and

122

potentiating the expression of antiviral genes including inflammatory cytokine genes (16, 17).

123

Indeed, dysregulation of the IFN pathways either by inborn errors or the generation of

124

autoantibodies against type I IFNs has been associated with COVID-19 severity (18, 19).

125

However, the robust interferon response observed in many severe COVID-19 patients also

126

likely contributes to the CRS (13, 20, 21). Thus, the upregulation of IRF2, IRF7, and STAT, in all

127

cell types may be driving the amplification of IFN response pathways and thereby the

128

overproduction of inflammatory cytokines that contribute to COVID-19 CRS pathogenesis.

129

Consistent with this, inhibiting JAK-STAT signaling with baricitinib significantly improved

130

recovery time and survival rates among patients with severe COVID-19, likely by suppressing

131

the CRS (4, 22).

132

We next focused on TF hubs, TFs that interact with many overexpressed cytokine

133

genes, since they likely play important roles in COVID-19 CRS pathogenesis. We found that

134

TFs with the highest number of positively correlated interactions were well-known pathogen-

135

activated transcriptional activators, such as REL (29 interactions), STAT1 (29 interactions),

136

IRF7 (28 interactions), and NFKB1 (27 interactions). Additionally, we found that NF-κB family

137

members regulated the most number of unique cytokines (e.g.,REL - 9 cytokines, RELA - 9

138

cytokines, and NFKB1 - 8 cytokines). This is consistent with NF-κB being a potent inducer of

139

cytokine production and NF-κB hyperactivation being directly implicated in the CRS observed in

140

severe COVID-19 patients (23). Collectively, these findings support that targeting NF-κB may

141

have therapeutic benefits in controlling the CRS in COVID-19 patients.

142

Drug repurposing offers a viable therapeutic approach that can significantly shorten the

143

time to deliver effective treatments to COVID-19 patients. We identified 19 TFs in the networks

144

that are targets of FDA approved drugs (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table). Of these, NFKB1,

145

RELA, JUN, FOS, and HIF1A, displayed the highest number of positively correlated interactions

146

and interacted with the most number of unique cytokines. Similar to NF-κB TFs, AP-1 TFs (FOS

147

and JUN) are critical regulators of inflammatory cytokine genes such as CCL2 and IL6 (24, 25),

148

which are expressed at high levels in COVID-19 patients (26-28). Interestingly, CCL2 and IL6

149

can also induce expression of AP-1 genes and regulate activation of AP-1 proteins (29-31).

150

Therefore, targeting AP-1 has the potential to block these positive feedback loops in addition to

151

limiting the expression of multiple inflammatory cytokines overexpressed in COVID-19 patients.

152

HIF1A (Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 Alpha) is a master transcriptional regulator that is

153

activated under hypoxic conditions. Indeed, hypoxia is a primary pathophysiological feature in

154

severe COVID-19 and HIF1A is speculated to contribute largely to the CRS by activating and

155

preventing turnover of immune cells including macrophages and neutrophils, which secrete

156

large amounts of inflammatory cytokines (32-35). Consistent with this, we found that in seven

157

immune cell types, the expression of HIF1A was positively correlated with the expression of

158

CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL8, which are potent chemoattractants for immature macrophages and

159

neutrophils (36), and the expression of TNFSF13B, which promotes cell survival (37). These

160

findings suggest that targeting HIF1A could interfere with several processes that contribute to

161

the CRS in COVID-19.

162
163

Targeting TFs to suppress the production of cytokines involved in the COVID-19 CRS

164

To reduce the expression of cytokines associated with the COVID-19 CRS, we sought drugs

165

that target the major TF hubs within the network. We prioritized drugs by their status as

166

approved or investigational (i.e. in clinical trials), selectivity, and availability. Based on these

167

criteria, we selected five FDA approved drugs that target the TF hubs (carvedilol - HIF1A,

168

dexamethasone - NR3C1, dimethyl fumarate - RELA, glycyrrhizic acid - NFKB1/2, and

169

sulfasalazine - NF-κB) and one clinical drug (T5224 - FOS/JUN), and investigated their ability to

170

downregulate several key cytokines implicated in the COVID-19 CRS (CCL2, CXCL8, and IL6).

171

We investigated the effect of these drugs, alone and in combination, in peripheral blood

172

mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from four healthy human donors stimulated with R848 or LPS,

173

potent TLR7/TLR8 and TLR4 agonists, respectively (38-40). Since TLR7/TLR8 recognize

174

single-stranded RNA from viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and TLR4, a receptor that recognizes

175

various endogenous and exogenous proteins which was predicted to strongly interact with the

176

SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (41), activation of these TLR signaling pathways can partially

177

mimic the inflammatory response in COVID-19. We found two drugs, dimethyl fumarate and

178

T5224, that inhibited the production of CCL2, CXCL8, and IL6 (Figure 2C-D). This confirms that

179

targeting TF hubs has the potential to concomitantly limit the production of multiple cytokines

180

upregulated in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, testing all pairwise drug combinations revealed

181

11 combinations that synergistically reduced the production of at least one cytokine in either

182

stimulated conditions in all PBMC donors (Figure 2C-D). In particular, the combination of

183

dexamethasone with sulfasalazine or T5224 most consistently produced a synergistic effect in

184

reducing cytokine production across the PBMC donors. This may be attributed to these drugs

185

targeting TFs in parallel inflammatory pathways. Collectively, we identified multiple candidate

186

repurposable drugs for the potential treatment of COVID-19 CRS. However, further animal

187

models and clinical trials are required to verify the clinical benefits of these predicted drug

188

candidates.

189
190

Targeting nuclear receptors to suppress the production of cytokines involved in the

191

COVID-19 CRS

192

TFs from the nuclear receptor (NR) family present promising therapeutic targets because of the

193

lipophilic nature of their ligands and because numerous FDA approved drugs targeting NRs are

194

currently available. Not surprisingly, only a few NRs were significantly correlated in expression

195

with cytokines overexpressed in the COVID-19 patients (Figure 1), since NRs are ligand-

196

activated TFs and therefore their activities are primarily regulated at the protein level. To explore

197

the therapeutic potential of targeting NRs to reduce the expression of cytokines elevated in

198

COVID-19 patients, we first identified cytokines that were significantly upregulated (Padj<0.05,

199

fold change ≥ 2) in the BALFs of moderate (Figure 3A) and severe (Figure 3B) COVID-19

200

patients compared to healthy controls (12). We then analyzed the expression of these cytokines

201

using publicly available transcriptomic data collected from primary human cells and cell lines

202

treated with small molecule NR drugs (Signaling Pathways Project) (42). We found that, while

203

drugs targeting NRs across many families can modulate the expression of cytokines, drugs

204

targeting members of the 3-ketosteroid, vitamin D, and peroxisome proliferator-activated

205

receptor families, tend to reduce the expression of inflammatory cytokines (Figure 3C).

206

We next investigated the therapeutic potential of five approved NR drugs

207

(acetaminophen, dexamethasone, ercalcitriol, mometasone, and rosiglitazone) that strongly

208

downregulated the expression of multiple cytokines in the expression profiling datasets (Figure

209

3C), and assayed their effect on CCL2, CXCL8, and IL6, in R848 or LPS stimulated PBMCs

210

(Figure 4A-D). Indeed, TF targets of some of these drugs, for example NR3C1 and VDR, have

211

been reported to directly regulate CCL2, CXCL8, and IL6 expression in other stimulated

212

contexts (9, 10, 43). We found that dexamethasone and mometasone, both of which target

213

NR3C1, most potently reduced the production of CXCL8 and IL6 (Figure 4C-D). Additionally,

214

testing all pairwise combinations revealed that all 10 drug combinations either additively or

215

synergistically reduced the production of CCL2 and CXCL8 in all PBMC samples stimulated with

216

R848 (Figure 4C). Generally, across the PBMC samples, combinations of dexamethasone with

217

rosiglitazone and mometasone with ercalcitriol most consistently produced a synergistic effect in

218

reducing cytokine production, while combinations of dexamethasone or mometasone with

219

ercalcitriol most potently reduced cytokine production. Overall, these findings suggest there may

220

be potential therapeutic benefits of repurposing these NR drugs to suppress the CRS in COVID-

221

19 patients. Further studies are required to determine the clinical benefits of these drug

222

candidates.

Discussion

225

In the present study, we used a gene regulatory network approach to identify candidate TFs that

226

regulate cytokines overexpressed in COVID-19 patients and evaluated approved drugs

227

targeting these TFs for their ability to downregulate three key cytokines frequently associated

228

with disease severity. We identified two drugs (dimethyl fumarate and T5224) that individually

229

potently suppressed cytokine production, and 25 drug combinations that could synergistically

230

suppress cytokine production. Altogether, these findings provide several promising candidate

231

drugs and targets with potential therapeutic effects for controlling the CRS in COVID-19.

232

Our network-based approach identified TF hubs that likely regulate many of the

233

cytokines overexpressed in COVID-19 patients. We showed that by targeting these TF hubs, for

234

example targeting RELA with dimethyl fumarate and AP-1 with T5224, we were able to

235

concomitantly inhibit the production of multiple cytokines. Moreover, targeting TF hubs may also

236

interfere with positive feedback and feedforward loops of cytokine production that lead to the

237

CRS (23). It would also be interesting to explore targeting non-hub TFs that regulate a key

238

cytokine responsible for driving these loops, as the effects could me more specific with less side

239

effects.

240

Combination therapies have the potential to increase drug efficacy and reduce side

241

effects, and have thus become a routine strategy in the treatment of diseases (44). In particular,

242

synergistic combinations allow the use of lower doses to achieve the same effect as the

243

individual drugs, which may reduce adverse reactions. Notably, nearly all drugs we tested

244

achieved a similar or stronger suppression of cytokine production when used at a 10-fold lower

245

dose in combination than when used individually. This includes the combination of

246

dexamethasone with ercalcitriol (active metabolite of vitamin D). Thus, in the debate of whether

247

vitamin D supplementation has beneficial effects in the treatment of COVID-19, at least from the

248

perspective of treating the CRS, vitamin D may enhance the anti-inflammatory effects of

249

dexamethasone.

250

Aside from having well-known anti-inflammatory properties, some of the drugs tested

251

also have reported antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2. Dimethyl fumarate, mometasone,

252

calcitriol, and sulfasalazine, potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro in Vero E6 cells

253

(45-48). The antiviral activities of Glycyrrhizin have been extensively studied in the context of

254

other human viruses and most notably, the drug was found to potently suppress replication of

255

two clinical isolates of SARS-associated coronavirus in Vero cells (49), and preliminarily,

256

neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by inhibiting the viral main protease (50). Further, Carvedilol and

257

Acetaminophen have been reported to decrease the expression of ACE2 and serine protease

258

TMPRSS2, respectively (51, 52), both of which are required for SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells

259

(53). Hence, drug combinations that simultaneously exert both anti-inflammatory and antiviral

260

effects against SARS-CoV-2 may have the greatest potential to be effective in treating COVID-

261

19.

262

There is growing evidence that certain food supplements may have therapeutic benefits

263

in COVID-19. Numerous small-scale studies have found that patients with sufficient vitamin D

264

levels are less likely to have life-threatening complications (54-56). Additionally, glycyrrhizic

265

acid, a frequent component in traditional Chinese medicines and the main constituent in licorice,

266

has been reported to have anti-inflammatory properties, by antagonizing TLR4 (57, 58), and

267

broad antiviral activities (49). Other foods are also known to inhibit inflammatory mediators, for

268

example curcumin, a substance in turmeric that gives curry its distinct flavor and yellow color,

269

inhibits numerous TFs including NF-κB, AP-1, and HIF1A, and has potent anti-inflammatory

270

properties (59, 60). Hence, a study of the association between food intake and the severity of

271

COVID-19 symptoms and outcomes may shed light into differences in severity and mortality

272

between countries (61).

273

In summary, our approach of targeting transcriptional regulators of cytokines associated

274

with the CRS provides candidate drugs and targets to treat COVID-19. However, additional

275

research is needed to determine whether these combinations elicit the same immunomodulatory

276

response in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. More importantly, although all the drugs

277

investigated in this study are FDA approved, careful evaluation of the efficacy, safety, and risk-

278

benefit balance of these drugs in animal models and COVID-19 patients is necessary as

outcomes of drug interactions could drastically differ between in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trials.

280

Nonetheless, the candidate drugs show promise for further investigation in downregulating the

281

CRS in COVID-19 patients. More broadly, the findings reported here may also be applicable to

282

CRS resulting from other viral infections, bacterial infections, sepsis, and CAR-T therapies.

283
284

Methods

285

ScRNA-seq data processing

286

scRNA-seq data from BALF cells of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls was downloaded

287

from GEO repositories GSE145926 (12) and GSE128033 (15). For all datasets, we used

288

STARsolo (v 2.7.3) (62) to align reads to the human GRCh38 genome and quantify read counts

289

to determine gene expression. We used Scrubblet (63) to detect and remove doublets, and then

290

filtered the remaining data to only retain cells with 1000-50000 UMI counts, 500-7500 genes,

291

and less than 25% mitochondrial reads. A total of 72,433 cells remaining were used for all

292

subsequent analysis. Finally, the data was normalized using the regularized negative binomial

293

regression method (64) and batch effect was removed using the Canonical Correlation Analysis

294

method (65).

295

Cell clustering was performed using Seurat (v3.1.4) (65) and cell type classifications were

296

obtained using SingleR (66), and then validated with canonical immune cell type markers. The

297

following markers were used to identify cell types: ciliated epithelial cells: TUBB4B and TPPP3;

298

secretory epithelial cells: SCGB3A1 and SCGB1A1; neutrophils: S100A8, S100A9 and FCN1;

299

macrophages: APOE, C1QA and C1QB;

300

plasmacytoid dendritic cells: TCF4 and TNFRSF21; mast cells: AREG, TPSB2 and TPSAB1;

301

NK cells: GNLY, PRF1, NKG7 and the absence of the general T cell markers; T cells: CD3D,

302

CD3G, CD4E, CD4 (CD4 T cells only) and CD8 (CD8 T cells only); B cells: CD79A, CD79B and

303

MS4A1; plasma cells: IGHG1, IGHG2 and IGHG4.

myeloid dendritic cells: FCER1A and CD1C;

305

Differential gene expression analysis

306

Differential gene expression analysis, between BALF cells from COVID-19 patients and healthy

307

controls, was performed using a Wilcoxon test, and the P values were adjusted by false

308

discovery rate correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.

309
310

Correlation analysis

311

Correlation coefficients between TFs and cytokines in BALF cells from COVID-19 patients were

312

determined using the Pearson correlation method, and the P values were adjusted by false

313

discovery rate correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. The correlation analyses were

314

restricted to cells with reads for both the TF and the cytokine, to limit noise and over-estimation

315

of the correlation due to cells with zero reads for either the TF or the cytokine or both, and cell

316

types with more than 10% of cells expressing both the TF and the cytokine. Correlations

317

between TFs and cytokines were determined per cell type.

318
319

Signaling Pathways Project data acquisition and processing

320

A list of cytokines that were differentially expressed and upregulated in BALFs of COVID-19

321

patients compared to healthy controls was submitted to the Signaling Pathways Project Ominer

322

web tool (42) on July 25, 2020. The search criteria included Omics Category: Transcriptomics,

323

Module Category: Nuclear receptors - all families, Biosample Category: Human - all

324

physiological systems, FDR Significance Cut-off: 5E-02. The search results were downloaded

325

as a table reporting the fold change for cytokine gene expression in experimental versus control

326

conditions. Only experiments involving small molecule NR drugs were further explored in our

327

analysis. If there were multiple experiments for a drug-cytokine interaction, only interactions

328

wherein at least 80% of the experiments resulted in cytokine gene expression changing in the

329

same direction were included in our analysis. Finally, for each drug-cytokine interaction, we

333

PBMC purification and drug treatment

334

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from de-identified human

335

leukapheresis-processed blood (New York Biologics, Inc) by centrifugation through Lymphoprep

336

(Stem Cell Technologies.) density gradient. PBMCs were washed in PBS, resuspended in red

337

blood cell lysis solution for 5 min, and washed three more times in PBS. Purified PBMCs were

338

cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic (100X) and plated

339

in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml and 0.1 ml/well. Purified PBMCs were

340

immediately treated with the different drugs or frozen in RPMI supplemented with 40% FBS,

341

10% DMSO, and 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic (100X). Frozen PBMCs were rapidly thawed in a

342

37°C water bath, washed three times in warm RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and 1%

343

Antibiotic-Antimycotic (100X), and rested for 1 hour at 37°C before drug treatment. Fresh or

344

thawed PBMCs were pretreated with Acetaminophen (MiliporeSigma), Dexamethasone

345

(MiliporeSigma), Ercalcitriol (Tocris), Mometasone (Tocris), or Rosiglitazone (Tocris), at the

346

various concentrations for 30 minutes, and then stimulated with R848 (1 µM) or LPS (100

347

ng/ml), for 20 hours. The supernatants were collected and the amounts of CCL2, CXCL8, and

348

IL6, were quantified by ELISA. Each experimental condition was performed in two biological

349

replicates for each PBMC donor, and the average of the replicates was used to determine

350

cytokine expression.

351
352

Measurement of cytokine production

353

The amount of cytokines (CCL2, CXCL8, and Il6) in treated PBMC supernatants were quantified

354

by ELISA using the ELISA MAX Deluxe Set Human CCL2 (Biolegend), ELISA MAX Deluxe Set

Calculation of coefficient of drug interaction

359

To determine drug interactions (i.e. additive, synergistic, or antagonistic), we calculated the

360

coefficient of drug interaction (CDI) using the formula CDI=AB/(A×B), where AB is the ratio of

361

the combination to the control, and A or B is the ratio of the single drug to the control. We then

362

applied the following thresholds to determine the drug interaction, CDI=0.7-1.3 indicates an

363

additive interaction, CDI <0.7 indicates a synergistic interaction, and CDI >1.3 indicates an

364

antagonistic interaction.

Immune cell sub-networks mapping 581 TF-cytokine gene interactions between 95 TFs and 16

548

cytokine genes upregulated in BALFs of COVID-19 patients. Networks were restricted to

549

interactions that are significantly correlated (Padj<0.05) with a Pearson correlation coefficient

550

>0.1 or <-0.1 in the respective immune cell subtype. Diamonds represent cytokines and circles

551

represent TFs. TFs that are targets of FDA approved drugs are indicated in purple circles. The

552

node color denotes the differential gene expression of TFs and cytokines in the respective

553

immune cell subtype from BALFs of COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. The edge

554

color denotes the Pearson correlation coefficient, and the edge thickness is proportional to the

555

correlation adjusted P value.
