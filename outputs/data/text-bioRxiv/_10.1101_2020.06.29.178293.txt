Abstract

26
27

The renal lesions – including severe acute kidney injury – are severe outcomes in

28

SARS-CoV-2 infections. There are no reports regarding the influence of the nutritional

29

status on the severity and progress of these lesions. Ageing is also an important risk

30

factor. In the present communication we compare the influence of overweight and

31

undernutrition in the levels of renal angiotensin converting enzymes 1 and 2. Since the

32

renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been implicated in the progress of

33

kidney failure during Covid-19, we also investigated the influence of Angiotensin-(3–4)

34

(Ang-(3–4)) the shortest angiotensin-derived peptide, which is considered the

35

physiological antagonist of several angiotensin II effects. We found that both

36

overweight and undernutrition downregulate the levels of angiotensin converting

37

enzyme 2 (ACE2) without influence on the levels of ACE1 in kidney rats. Administration

38

of Ang-(3–4) recovers the control levels of ACE2 in overweight but not in

39

undernourished rats. We conclude that chronic and opposite nutritional conditions play

40

a central role in the pathophysiology of renal Covid-19 lesions, and that the role of

41

RAAS is also different in overweight and undernutrition.

Introduction

47

Since the first report of Covid-19 in China on 31 December 2019 and isolation of the

48

SARS-CoV-2 virus on January 7, 2020, the number of infections is still growing with an

49

accelerated rate, as well as the number of deaths worldwide (1). Considering all

50

countries and regions, the number of infections reached >9 million people and more

51

than 475,000 deaths on June 24, 2020 [2]. Even though the illness was considered a

52

viral infection targeting the respiratory system [3], some cases developed into septic

53

shock [4,5], in which acute kidney injury (AKI) plays a central role [6]. Age, cancer,

54

cardiovascular diseases and metabolic diseases – such as diabetes – are currently

55

considered the main risk factors for the explosive outbreak of the pandemic [7].

56

With respect to the kidney and AKI, it is important to remember that angiotensin

57

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), considered to be the way of entrance of SARS-CoV-2

58

into cells [8,9], is highly expressed in the membranes of proximal tubule cells [10], the

59

tubular segment specially affected in AKI [11]. Moreover, levels of ACE2 seem to be

60

important during Covid-19 infections, and this has been recently reviewed in terms of

61

an apparent paradox demonstrating friend-and-foe roles in the evolution of the viral

infection [12]. The levels of ACE2 decrease with ageing in different tissues [13,14], but

63

there are no reports regarding the influence of the nutritional status on these levels,

64

especially in obesity and undernutrition, which, as recently emphasized, must be taken

65

into account to investigate the impact of Covid-19 [15].

66
67

Methods

68

The protocols were approved by the Committee for Ethics in Animal Experimentation

69

from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (#101/16 and #012/19). In this letter we

70

report the effect of a chronic administration of 2 different diets on the levels of ACE2 in

71

the external portion of rat renal cortex (cortex corticis), where <95% of the cell

72

population comprises the proximal tubules [16]. One was a deficient diet that provokes

73

undernutrition, mimicking the alimentary habits of different regions from developing

74

countries, the so-called Regional Basic Diet (RBD) [17], which is characterized by low

75

protein content (also of poor quality), associated with low lipid content, and absence of

76

vitamins and mineral supplementation. The other diet had high lipid and low

77

carbohydrate content, with an average of 50% higher NaCl than the control (CTR) diet

78

[18] (HL diet), that leads to obesity with an elevated deposition of visceral fat, a tissue

79

with high levels of inflammatory factors [19] that can stimulate the renin-angiotensin-

80

aldosterone system (RAAS) [20,21]. The experiments were conducted during the

81

development of 2 projects in our laboratory during the last year, and we believe that the

82

results – if presented together to allow comparisons – could shed some light on the

83

mechanisms underlying the progression and the severity of renal lesions due to Covid-

84

19.

85

Male Wistar rats were fed: (i) with the RBD from weaning (28 days of age) until

86

90 days of age; (ii): with the HL diet from 56 to 162 days of age. The CTR groups

87

received a commercial chow for rodents. At the end of the periods of exposure to the

88

different diets, the rats received Ang-(3–4), one oral dose (80 mg/kg body mass) 24 h

89

before sacrifice in the undernutrition study, and 4 doses at 12 h intervals from 48 h

90

before sacrifice. Angiotensin-(3–4) (Ang-(3–4), Val-Tyr), the shortest angiotensins-

91

derived peptide [22,23], can be viewed as a physiological antagonist of Angiotensin II

92

(Ang II) effects [24]. An enriched plasma membrane fraction from proximal tubule cells

93

was obtained as previously described [25]. Western blotting analyses were carried out

94

as described in the figure legends.

95
96

Results and Discussion

97

Figure 1 shows that ACE2 levels decrease with age in CTR rats, in contrast to the

98

outcome with ACE. Juvenile rats are the CTR animals from the undernutrition study

99

and, according to Quinn [26], 90 days of age correspond to 21 human years and 162

100

days (adult) correspond to 38 human years. The 50% decrease in ACE2 in this short

101

period of life (Figure 1A,B) represents, per se, an increase in the risk of kidney proximal

102

tubules damage – and therefore of AKI – during SARS-CoV-2 infection in

103

normonourished rats, and this could also be applicable to human kidneys, as in the

104

lungs [12]. Figure 1A,C shows that ACE levels remained unmodified over that relatively

105

long period of life and, therefore, this could contribute to the ACE/ACE2 imbalance that

106

would worsen kidney injuries, as is the case with lung and heart [27], especially in the

107

presence of comorbidities or modifications in the renal local RAAS.

108

In the next figures our results show that modifications in the nutritional status

109

profoundly modified ACE2 abundance in the renal cortex corticis, which is also

110

modulated in a different manner by antagonizing RAS in cases of overweight or

111

undernutrition. Figure 2A,B shows that the abundance of ACE2 decreased 30% in the

112

HL (overweight) rats whose body mass was ~20% higher than that of the CTR group.

113

Administration of Ang-(3–4) to the overweight rats increased by 80 and 150%, when

114

the ACE2 levels are compared with those in the CTR and HL rats, respectively, with no

115

influence in the normonourished group. This observation supports the view that, in

116

overweight animals, antagonizing the Ang II/type 1 Ang II receptor (AT1R) axis by Ang-

117

(3–4) could avoid adverse renal injury in SARS-CoV-2 infections. In addition, this last

118

finding implies that, beyond upregulation of the Ang II/Ang-(1–7)/Mas axis [28],

119

intrarenal RAAS can be counteracted – in the case of obesity/overweight – by the end

120

product of a pathway that involves progressively shorter Ang II-derived peptides, as we

121

demonstrated a decade ago [29]. The mechanism underlying the effect of the peptide

122

could be an action as “allosteric enhancer” that induces a second binding site in AT2R

123

with a very high affinity for Ang II [30], possibly involved in the modulation of ACE2

124

formation. Another possibility would be a beneficial formation of heterodimers involving

125

these modified AT2R and Mas receptors, and that are able to act on the ACE2, as in

126

the case of blood pressure [31]. That Ang-(3–4)-mediated upregulation of renal ACE2

127

occurred in overweight rats, but not in the CTR group, is indicative that a “pro-

128

hypertensive tissular microenvironment” (high Ang II) develops in animals fed with a

129

diet rich in lipids, causing downregulation of ACE2 (Figure 2A,B) and kidney injury

130

during a SARS-CoV-2 attack. The levels of ACE (Figure 2A,C) remained unmodified

131

either by diet or Ang-(3–4) treatment.

132

The influence of chronic undernutrition on renal ACE2 levels present some

133

similarity, but also a huge difference, compared with overweight rats (Figure 3). The

134

similarity is in the downregulation of the enzyme level by RBD alone (~40%) (Figure

135

3A,B), i.e. a value that did not differ from the overweight-induced downregulation seen

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.29.178293; this version posted June 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

136

in Figure 2A,B (~35%). Again, it may be that activation of the Ang II/AT 1R axis now in a

137

“pro-hypertensive tissular microenvironment” induced by the multideficient diet

138

contributes for the notable decrease in ACE2, and, since there was no modification in

139

ACE (Figure 3A,C), to the important ACE/ACE2 imbalance in proximal tubules that

140

might be crucial in the kidney, as seems to be the case in the lung [27]. On this

141

account, we have strong evidence for the existence of a “pro-hypertensive tissular

142

microenvironment” in chronically undernourished rats: the increased number of Ang II-

143

positive cells in the tubulointerstitium [32] leads to an increase of the local RAAS. In

144

contrast with that observed in the case of overweight rats, the administration of Ang-(3–

145

4) (i) did not recover (or upregulates) ACE2 in undernourished rats, and (ii) provoked a

146

similar decrease in CTR rats. The second observation meets with the supposition that

147

AT2R acts in parallel with AT1R in promoting tissular damage in kidney tissue (recently

148

reviewed in [27]). There is a possibility of an adjuvant and independent AT 2R-

149

associated pathway that, being altered by an amino acid imbalance [33] due to

150

undernutrition, downregulates ACE2 synthesis and levels. A second possibility is the

151

formation of heterodimers between AT1R and abnormal AT2R, which could be

152

modulated by Ang II and Ang-(3–4), as in the case of spontaneously hypertensive rats

153

[34]. As noted above, these rats are of a juvenile age. Therefore, undernutrition could

154

favor severe kidney lesions in young people affected by Covid-19, an issue that has not

155

been explored until the present.

156
157

Conclusion

158

In summary, our evidence is that overweight and undernutrition favor downregulation of

159

the ACE2 level in proximal tubule cells, being a threat during the clinical evolution of

160

the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the results demonstrate that counteracting RAAS

161

by Ang-(3–4) administration influences ACE2 synthesis in an opposite way in

162

overweight and undernourished rats.

Figure 1. ACE2, but not ACE levels decrease in normonourished CTR rats aged 162

295

days (adult) compared to CTR 90 days-old rats (juvenile). (A) Representative

296

immunoblottings from renal cortex corticis of juvenile and adult rats, with β-actin as the

297

loading control. Bargraph representation of ACE2 (B) and ACE (C) levels in renal

298

cortex corticis of juvenile and adult rats. Bars indicate means ± SEM (n = 4−8 different

299

membrane preparations). Statistical differences were estimated by unpaired Student’s

300

t-test. P values are indicated within the panels. Differences were set at P<0.05. In A,

301

the representative blots from juvenile and adult rats were the same for ACE2 and ACE.

302

Cutting was unavoidable because different studies are being compared. Loading

303

controls were run on the same blot.
