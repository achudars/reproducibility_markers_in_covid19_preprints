Abstract
Aim: Kidney impairment is observed in patients with COVID-19. We aimed to
demonstrate the effect of anti-COVID-19 agent remdesivir on renal fibrosis.
Methods: Remdesivir and its active nucleoside metabolite GS-441524 were used to
treat TGF-β stimulated renal fibroblasts (NRK-49F) and human renal epithelial cells
(HK2). Cell viability was determined by CCK8 assay, and fibrotic markers were
measured by Western blotting. Vehicle or remdesivir were given by intraperitoneal
injection or renal injection through the left ureter in unilateral ureteral obstruction
(UUO) mice. Serum and kidneys were harvested. The concentrations of remdesivir
and GS-441524 were measured using LC-MS/MS. Renal and liver function were
assessed. Renal fibrosis was evaluated by Masson’s trichrome staining and Western
blotting.
Results: Remdesivir and GS-441524 inhibited cell proliferation and the expression of
fibrotic markers (fibronectin, pSmad3, and aSMA) in NRK-49F and HK2 cells.
Intraperitoneal injection or renal injection of remdesivir attenuated renal fibrosis of
UUO kidneys. Renal and liver function were not changed in remdesivir treated UUO
mice. Remdesivir can not be detected, but two remdesivir metabolites were detected
after injection.
Conclusion: Remdesivir inhibits renal fibrosis in obstructed kidneys.

Introduction
A novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) reported in Wuhan in late December 2019 has
rapidly spread to the rest of the world (1, 2). Novel coronavirus pneumonia is
becoming a worldwide public health event due to the rapid increase in new cases and
the high severity and mortality (1-3). A latest research shows that COVID-19 patients
in the intensive care unit were older (median age 66 vs 51) and more likely to have
comorbidities (72.2% vs 37.3%) than patients not in the intensive care unit,
suggesting that elderly people or patients with underlying disease have higher disease
severity (3). Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common disorder and the prevalence
of CKD is around 10% in adults (4, 5). Thus, CKD patients combined with
COVID-19 should be drawn enough attention from nephrologists.
It is worth noting that the 2019-nCoV can not only cause pneumonia, but also
damage other organs, such as the heart, liver and kidneys (6). Angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) mediates the entry of 2019-nCoV coronavirus into human cells (7).
It has been found that ACE2 is highly expressed in renal tubular cells, implying that
2019-nCoV may directly bind to ACE2-positive cells in the kidney and thus induce
kidney injuries (7). Indeed, a clinical study reported that 27.06% of patients with
COVID-19 exhibited acute renal failure (ARF), while elderly patients (≥60 years)
were more likely to develop ARF (65.22% vs 24.19%) (8). A further
immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that the antigen for 2019-nCoV accumulates
in renal tubules (8). Another clinical study with 59 COVID-19 patients showed that
proteinuria occurred in 63% of patients (9). 19% and 27% COVID-19 patients have

elevated plasma creatinine and urea nitrogen levels, respectively (9). A consecutive
cohort study with 710 COVID-19 patients further shows that the prevalence of renal
impairment is high, which is associated with in-hospital death (10). Therefore, enough
attentions should be paid to kidney protection of COVID-19 patients, and the effect of
anti-COVID-19 agents on the kidney should also be concerned.
Renal interstitial fibrosis is a common pathway and main pathological basis for the
progression of various chronic kidney diseases to the end-stage renal disease (ESRD)
(11, 12). It is characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix in the
kidney leading to completely loss of renal function (11, 12). Loss of renal tubule
drives the development of renal interstitial fibrosis by producing a large number of
profibrotic factors such as TGF-β (12, 13). It has been shown by several animal
models that the TGF-β / Smad3 signaling pathway play a key role in renal fibrosis
(14, 15).
Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a nucleoside analogue designed for the treatment of
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), the Middle East respiratory
syndrome (MERS) and Ebola virus (16, 17). It can be anabolized to the active
triphosphate metabolite and then incorporated into the newly synthesized RNA strand
of the virus as a substrate for viral RNA-dependent RNA synthetase (RdRp), thereby
prematurely terminating viral RNA transcription (16, 17). In vitro study shows that
remdesivir can effectively inhibit the infection of 2019-nCoV (18). A single case
study shows that treatment with remdesivir improved the clinical condition of the first
severely infected COVID-19 patient in the United States in 24 hours (19). Currently,

several clinical trials using remdesivir as a treatment for infected COVID-19 patients
are undergoing around the world. The first phase III clinical trial which is conducted
in China is expected to be completed in the end of April 2020 (ClinicalTrials.gov
Identifier: NCT04257656).
The aim of the current study is to determine the effect remdesivir on renal fibrosis.

Results
Remdesivir inhibited renal fibrosis in vitro
GS-441524, the active metabolite of remdesivir, was used to treat TGF-β
stimulated rat renal interstitial fibroblasts (NRK-49F) and huamn renal epithelial cells
(HK2) (20). 24 hours stimulation with 2.5 ng/ml TGF-β increased the cell
proliferation of NRK-49F cells as shown by CCK8 assay, and treatment with the
highest concentration (100 μM) of GS-441524 significantly inhibited its cell
proliferation (Figure 1A). There was no dead cells and cell morphology was normal at
the highest concentration (100 μM) of GS-441524 when observed by microscopy.
The protein expression of fibronectin (FN), phosphorylation of Smad3 (pSmad3),
and alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) were assessed by Western blotting as
markers for fibrosis. TGF-β stimulation increased the expression of FN, pSmad3 and

α-SMA in NRK-49F cells, and dose-dependent inhibition of these fibrotic markers
was observed starting from 10 μM of GS-441524 (Figure1B).
The effect of GS-441524 on renal fibrosis was further studied in renal epithelial
cells (HK2). 48 hours stimulation with 2.5 ng/ml TGF-β increased the cell
proliferation of HK cells as shown by CCK8 assay, and inhibition of cell proliferation
was observed at 100 μM of GS-441524 (Figure 1C). Remarkable inhibition of FN,
pSmad3, and α-SMA expression by GS-44152 was observed starting from 10 μM of
GS-441524 (Figure 1D).
We further tested the direct effect of remdesivir in vitro. 24 hours treatment with
remdesivir slightly inhibited cell proliferation of TGF-β stimulated NRF-49F cells at

the highest concentration (10 μM), although there was no significant difference
(Figure 2A). Inhibition of FN, pSmad3, and α-SMA expression by remdesivir was
observed starting from 1 μM of GS-441524 (Figure 2B).
Figure 2C shows that 48h treatment with remdesivir significantly inhibited cell
proliferation at the highest concentration of remdesivir (10 μM), and normal cell
morphology was observed at this concentration. The expression of FN, pSmad3, and

α-SMA were significantly down-regulated by remdesivir starting from 1 μM (Figure
2D).
Intraperitoneal injection of remdesivir inhibited renal fibrosis in UUO mice
Mouse renal fibrosis model was established by UUO operation. One day after
sham or UUO operations, mice were treated with vehicle or remdesivir for 10 days.
Treatment with remdesivir had no effect on body weight of sham and UUO mice, and
all mice were survived during the treatment (data not shown). Mild interstitial fibrosis
was observed in vehicle treated UUO mice, which was attenuated by remdesivir
(Figure 3A). The protein expression of FN, collagen-I (Col-I), pSmad3, and α-SMA
were up-regulated in UUO mouse kidneys as compared with that in sham operated
mouse kidneys, and the treatment with remdesivir significantly reduced the
expression of these pro-fibrotic proteins in UUO mouse kidneys (Figure 3B). Liver
function (ALT and AST) and renal function (Scr and BUN) were determined.
Remdesivir has no effect on either liver function or renal function (Figure 3C). Serum
and kidney concentration of remdesivir and two metabolites of remdesivir
(GS-441524 and Ala-Met) were determined by LC-MS/MS. Remdesivir can not be

detected in serum or kidney in both sham and UUO mice (data not shown). However,
GS-441524 can only be detected in the serum and kidney of remdesivir treated sham
or UUO mice (Figure 3D). Similarly, serum or kidney Ala-Met can only be detected
in remdesivir treated sham or UUO mice (Figure 3D).
Renal injection of remdesivir inhibited renal fibrosis in UUO mice
Remdesivir (1 mg/mL, 50 μl/mouse) or vehicle was infused retrogradely through
ureter to the left kidney which was subjected to unilateral utero ligation (UUO)
operation. Masson staining shows that interstitial fibrosis was attenuated in UUO
kidneys at day7 by local remdesivir injection (Figure 4A). The expression of FN,
Col-I, pSmad3, and α-SMA were reduced in remdesivir treated UUO kidneys as
compared with that in vehicle treated control kidneys at day7 as shown by Western
blotting (Figure 4B). Liver function (ALT and AST) and renal function (Scr and BUN)
were not changed by remdesivir in UUO mice (Figure 4C). The remdesivir metabolite
GS-441524 can only be detected in serum and kidney at 1 hour after injection only in
remdesivir treated mice, which can not be detected at day7 (Figure 4D). The Ala-Met
is abundant in remdesivir treated kidneys at 1 hour after injection and it was reduced
to background level at day7 (Figure 4D).

Discussion
The effect of remdesivir on renal fibrosis is currently unknown. In the present study,
we showed that remdesivir inhibits renal fibrosis. First, treatment with remdesivir or
its active metabolite GS-441524 inhibited fibrosis in two cellular models for renal
fibrosis. Second, systematic administration of remdesivir inhibited renal fibrosis as
shown by Masson staining and Western blotting. Third, local infusion of remdesivir
into UUO kidneys further revealed the anti-fibrotic effect of remdesivir.
The limitation of this study is that UUO model is not suitable to study the
pharmaceutical effect on renal function. UUO model is a classic model to study renal
fibrosis, although we did observe a slightly increase in Scr and BUN levels in UUO
mice as compared with that in sham mice (21). The renal and liver function were
assessed in this study to exclude the potential toxic effect of remdesivir, and we show
no effect of remdesivir on renal and liver function in this study.
The concentration of remdesivir was measured to assess the dosing efficacy.
However, we are not able to detect remdesivir in serum or kidneys in two different
dosing regimens or at different time points. This is probably due to the rapid turnover
of remdesivir by esterases which are abundant in blood and tissues (17, 22). Next, we
measured the concentration of two remdesivir metabolites, alanine metabolite
(Ala-Met) and nucleoside metabolite (GS-441524) (17). GS-441524 and Ala-Met can
be detected at 1 hour after IP injection in serum and kidneys of sham and UUO mice.
GS-441524 was detected in the serum and kidney at 1 hour after renal injection but
not at day 7 post-injection. To prove the specificity of renal infusion of remdesivir, we

further measured Ala-Met which can only be detected in kidneys but not in serum at 1
hour after renal injection, and it was not detectable at day 7 after renal injection.
In conclusion, we showed that remdesivir inhibits renal fibrosis in obstructed
kidneys.

Methods
Animals and UUO operation
Male C57 mice (SPF grade, 20-25g) were purchased and housed in Shanghai
Model Organisms Center Inc (SMOC) according to local regulations and guidelines.
After anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital (8mg/kg, i.p.), the left mouse kidney
was exposed by an incision. UUO operation was performed through twice ligation of
the left ureter with 4-0 nylon sutures. Animal experiments described here in were
approved by the animal experimentation ethics committee of Shanghai University of
Traditional Chinese Medicine (PZSHUTCM18111601).
For the experiment of 10 days treatment by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, mice
were randomly divided into four groups: (I) Sham + vehicle (n=5), (II) Sham +
remdesivir (n=7), (III) UUO + vehicle (n=8), and (IV) UUO + remdesivir (n=8) group.
Mice were treated with vehicle or 10 mg/kg remdesivir daily by i.p. injection. Mice
were sacrificed at day 10 at 1 hour after last injection. Serum and kidney tissue were
collected.
For the experiment of 1 hour or 7 days treatment by intrarenal injection, mice were
randomly divided into two groups: (I) UUO + vehicle (n=11), and (II) UUO +
remdesivir (n=11) group. Four mice from each group were sacrificed at 1 hour after
renal injection, and the rest of mice were sacrificed at day7. Serum and kidney tissue
were collected. Alanine transferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood
urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) values were assessed in clinical
laboratory of Shuguang hospital using a routine method.
In Vivo Drug Administration

Remdesivir (Product name GS-5734; Cat. No. CSN19703) was purchased from
CSNpharm (Chicago, Illinois, USA) and dissolved in DMSO as a 50mg/ml stock,
which was further diluted into normal saline by sonication as a working solution.
0.04% typan blue dye (A601140, Sangon, Shanghai, China) was added into vehicle or
remdisivir working solution to monitor the injection process. 50 μL of vehicle or
remdesivir (1mg/mL) was injected retrogradely once into the left kidney via the ureter.
Right after the injection, unilateral ureteral obstruction was performed.
Cell culture
HK2 renal proximal tubular epithelial cells were obtained from the Cell Bank of
Shanghai Institute of Biological Sciences (Chinese Academy of Science). NRK-49F
rat kidney interstitial fibroblast cells were purchased from National Infrastructure of
Cell Line Resource, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. HK2 and NRK-49F cells
were cultured in DMEM/F12 medium containing 10%FBS and 0.5% penicillin and
streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37°C. For Western blotting,
HK2 and NRK-49F cells were seeded in 6-well plate to 40-50% confluence, which
were starved with DMEM/F12 medium 0.5% fetal bovine serum overnight before the
experiment. In the next day, fresh medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum was
changed, and then cells were exposed to 2.5 ng/ml TGF-β (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ,
USA) for 24hr or 48h in the presence of various concentration of GS-441524 (Catalog
No. T7222, Targetmol, Boston, MA, USA) or remdesivir (Product name GS-5734;
Cat. No. CSN19703; CSNpharm, Chicago, IN, USA).

For the CCK8 assay, HK2 (15-25% confluence) and NRK-49F (30-40% confluence)
cells were seeded in tetraplicates in 96-well plates, which were starved with
DMEM/F12 medium 0.5% fetal bovine serum overnight before the experiment. In the
next day, fresh medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum was changed, and then
cells were exposed to 2.5 ng/ml TGF-β for 24hr-48hr in the presence of various
concentration of GS-441524 or remdesivir. After that, 10 μl CCK8 (YEASEN,
Shanghai, China) solution was added to each well and cells were incubated for 1 hr.
Cell viability was assessed by measure the absorbance at 450 nm.
Quantitation of remdesivir and its two metabolites
Remdesivir and its two metabolites, alanine metabolite (Ala-Met) and nucleoside
metabolite (GS-441524), in serum and kidney were determined using a LC-MS/MS
method as described in a previous literature with minor revision (17). In brief, 200 ul
of serum or kidney homogenates were mixed with equivalent volume of
acetonitrile-methanol mixture (1: 1, v/v). Then, internal standards were added,
vortexed, and centrifuged at 15,000 g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was collected
and mixed with equivalent volume of deionized water. An aliquot of 10 μl was
subsequently injected into a Waters LC-MS/MS system which contains an ACQUITY
UPLC and a Xevo TQ-S tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (Waters, Milford, MA,
USA). Standard solutions of remdesivir and GS-441524 were used to plot calibration
curves for quantification. Due to the standard is commercially unavailable, alanine
metabolite was semi-determined by mass spectrometry response.
Masson’s trichrome

Mouse kidneys were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and further embedded in paraffin.
Masson’s trichrome staining was performed using a standard protocol. Briefly, the
Four-μm-thick sections of paraffin-embedded kidney tissue was stained with
hematoxylin, and then with ponceau red liquid dye acid complex, which was followed
by incubation with phosphomolybdic acid solution. Finally, the tissue was stained
with aniline blue liquid and acetic acid. Images were obtained with the use of a
microscope (Nikon 80i, Tokyo, Japan).
Western blotting analysis
Renal protein was extracted from the medulla and cortex of mouse kidneys. The
protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method, and the supernatant was
dissolved in 5x SDS-PAGE loading buffer (P0015L, Beyotime Biotech, Nantong,
China). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoresis, proteins
were electro-transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Merck Millipore,
Darmstadt, Germany), which was incubated in the blocking buffer (5% non-fat milk,
20mM Tris-HCl, 150mMNaCl, PH=8.0, 0.01%Tween 20) for 1 hour at room
temperature and was followed by incubation with anti-fibronectin (1:1000, ab23750,
Abcam), anti-pSmad3 (1:1000, ET1609-41, HUABIO), anti-Collagen I (1:500,
AF7001, sc-293182, Santa Cruz), anti-α-SMA (1:1000, ET1607-53, HUABIO),
anti-GAPDH (1:5000, 60004-1-lg, Proteintech), or anti-α-tubulin (1:1000, AF0001,
Byotime) overnight at 4. Binding of the primary antibody was detected by an
enhanced chemiluminescence method (BeyoECL Star, P0018A, Byotime) using
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1:1000,

A0208, Beyotime or goat anti-mouse IgG, 1:1000, A0216, Beyotime). The
quantification of protein expression was performed using -Image J.
Statistical analysis
Results were presented as mean ± SD. Differences among multiple groups were
analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and comparison between two
groups was performed by unpaired student t-test by using GraphPad Prism version
8.0.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA). A P value of
lower than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Figures and figure legends

Figure 1
GS-441524, the intermediate metabolite of remdesivir, inhibited renal fibrosis in vitro.
(A) Following TGF-β stimulation, renal fibroblasts NRK-49F cells were treated with
various concentration (0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 μM) of GS-441524 for 24 hours. CCK8 assay
was performed to determine the viability of NRK-49F cells. (B and C) The expression
of fibronectin (FN), phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3), and alpha-smooth muscle actin
(α-SMA) of NRK-49F cells were analyzed by Western blotting and quantified; (D)
Upon TGF-β stimulation, human renal epithelial HK2 cells were treated with various
concentration (0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 μM) of GS-441524 for 48 hours. CCK8 assay was
performed to determine the viability of HK2 cells. (E and F) The expression of FN,
pSmad3, and α-SMA of HK2 cells were analyzed by Western blotting and quantified.

Figure 3
Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of remdesivir inhibited fibrosis in UUO mice.
After sham or UUO operation, wide type c57 mice were treated with 10 mg/kg/d
remdesivir by i.p. injection for 10 days. Serum and kidney tissue were collected 1
hour after remdesivir injection at day 10. (A) Renal fibrosis was assessed by Masson’s
trichrome staining. (B) The expression of FN, collagen I (Col-1), pSmad3, and
α-SMA by Western blotting. One representative of at least three independent
experiments is shown. (C) Liver function (ALT and AST) and renal function (Scr and
BUN) were assessed. (D) The concentrations of nucleoside metabolite (GS-441524)
and alanine metabolite (Ala-Met), two remdesivir metabolites, in serum and kidneys
were determined by LC-MS/MS. Data represent mean ± SD. ND represents not
