Abstract
The term chimeric virus was not popular in the last decades. Recently, according to
current sequencing efforts in discovering COVID-19 Secrets, the generated
information assumed the presence of 6 Coronavirus main strains, but coronavirus
diverges into hundreds of sub-strains. the bottleneck is the mutation rate. With two
mutation/month, humanity will meet a new sub-strain every month. Tracking new
sequenced viruses is urgently needed because of the pathogenic effect of the new substrains. here we introduce COVATOR, A user-friendly and python-based software that
identifies viral chimerism. COVATOR aligns input genome and protein that has no
known source, against genomes and protein with known source, then gives the user a
graphical summary.

Introduction
The largest known single-stranded RNA viruses are coronaviruses (CoVs) [1].
They cause a different illness in mammals and birds, ranging from enteritis in cows,
pigs, and upper respirational diseases in chickens to life-threatening humans. The first
diagnosed case in Southern China was a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
that was first described in 2002 [2]. Then just 10 years after the appearance of a
SARS-CoV, a new evolving Coronavirus called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome
(MERS-CoV) affected about 50% of people in the Middle East. on 10 March 2016,
The Global MERS Case Count according to the World Health Organization (WHO)
was 1,651 laboratory-confirmed cases [3]. The murin coronavirus of the SARS and
MER-SCoV viruses, Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV), was a model for both the
molecular biology and the pathogenesis of the members of these viral families for
many years.
Quite recently, a novel betaCoV coronavirus (2019nCoV) has been connected
to serious human respiratory infections from the province of Wuhan, China. In China,
new 8 cases of 2019nCoVrelated pneumonia, plus approximately 650,000 cases
from 23 other countries, have been reported at the time of the written study. Now, this

pathogen has 1,301,818 deaths (Source: WorldMeter). Phylogenetic relationships
between Bat and Human coronaviridae have been discovered for SARS [4] and more
recently also for 2019nCoV,[5] suggesting events of interspecies transmissions.[6]
Viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, HIV, and influenza, encode their genome in RNA,
tend to collect mutations as copied within their hosts, since enzymes that copy RNA
are susceptible to errors. In the latest days, sequencing evidence indicates that
coronaviruses transform slower than most other RNA viruses, presumably because
of an enzyme that reads and remedies lethal copying errors. Just two mutations per
month in virus genome accumulate representing about half the influenza rate and a
quarter HIV rate [7]. Most modifications do not modify the actions of the infection,
but a few can alter the transmissibility or seriousness of the illness.

Korber et al. demonstrated in April 2020 that the "D614G" transition had
contributed to the rising transmissibility of viruses that soon became the world's
dominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage [8]. The variant, however, could make the
vaccines easier to target SARS-CoV-2. However, extreme acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) started to circulate in humans, a deletion mutation that might
have hindered its propagation was created. [9]
More time, more mutations, more different strains. For example, one mutation
in its receptor-binding domain (RBD) was found to be in India out of two isolates
at location 407 and it was not previously recorded. At that place, isoleucine (a
hydrophobic amino acid which is also a C- β branched amino acid, has been
substituted for arginine. [10]
At the beginning of the pandemic, we were dealing with only one version of the
virus. Now, we are dealing with virus lineage-specific for each country, soon we are
going to deal with the unique virus for each group of people, and the worst scenario
when it will be a unique version for each person. Tracking the virus through countries
is urgently needed. There are many software tracks changes in virus genome such as
Nextstrain [11] and genome-protein classification such as COVIDier [12] but it is still
limited to submitted data only. Here we introduce COVATOR, a real-time tracking
software where the user could submit a virus genome and the results will show the
locations where protein sequences are originated.
Material and Methods
The idea behind COVATOR is using BLAST [13] to align genome against
genome and proteins with known source locations. It firstly aligns genome against
genome to get an overview of the genome source, secondly align referenced proteins
against the inputted genome to get a deeper insight into each protein source.
Database Construction
COVATOR uses “makeblastdb” software to build two reference databases, one

for genome and one for proteins. reference genomes to align inputted unknown
genome against reference genomes with known location to find out how unknown
inputted genome like references and the second is reference CDs to discover the
source location of each protein to get more details about proteins source of the
unknown inputted genome.
BLASTing
Using “blast”, COVATOR begins alignment of all coronavirus twelve CDs
against the inputted genome. Alignment results were formatted, sorted, and aligned in
a separate file for each gene. We used CDs of the coronavirus gene to avoid protein
sequence conservation and avoid the nucleotide noise in raw gene sequence where
CDs have the requirement for protein-coding and each CDs has its own signature that
allows the differentiation between several country sources.
Representing the Results
COVATOR generates two folders, “CDsResults” and “GenomesResults”. Each
folder contains a folder titled with the name of the inputted genome. In
“GenomesResults”, BLAST aligns each CDs, python script generates a file with a
summary of blast results and generates a summary figure of the country. In
“CDsResults”, four Alignment files are generated. Aliview [13] format, BLAST
results in FASTA format, HTML format, and BLAST result in text format.
Discussion
The evolving virus leads to the spreading of different strains in the world, each
country begins to develop its specific strain. Developing different strains may lead to
confusion in drug and vaccine development. Due to mutation that may occur in
critical sites in protein that represent a drug target, drug or vaccine that is effective
with certain strains may not work with another strain due to mutation effect that
allows viruses to disguise from treatment [10]. This diversity within the same virus
leads to the production of “Chimeric” viruses in which their components are derived
from different sources which are explained in figure (1).

COVATOR aligning the unknown input genome with known genomes to finds out the
most similar genome to the inputted one. Inputted genome passes with two steps. First
is general alignment to get a fast summary of the genome source. The second,
identifying each protein source by extracting unknown protein from the inputted
genome, then aligning it against proteins with known source as shown in figure (2).

Use Case
COVATOR analysis is composed of two steps, the first step is a summary, and the
second extract deep information. We used Coronavirus genome ID: MT883499.1
from NCBI [14] in the FASTA file in the Linux Terminal (figure 3). and the results
were a summary list of BLAST results (Table 1) and a Figure represent the country
occurrence (figure 4). COVATOR creates a database from the input genome then
blasting all CDs against it.

The second step gets more detail about the differences between the inputted
genome and reference CDs. In this step, COVATOR built a database from CDs
instead of the input genome to generate the result in the targeted format needed
for further analysis. BLAST results processed using view [12] to generate HTML

molecular and computational effort to face this killer is urgently needed. Developing
new drugs or vaccine Running in full swing. Unfortunately, the virus evolved in a
faster rhythm leading to emerging of new strains. Currently, we have six strains over
the world according to Nextstrain [13], but the long-lasting virus in each country and
mixing of different strains lead to the development of new Chimeric viruses which
their proteins are sourced from different locations. The efforts in developing antiviral
agent require specific details for the target of the antiviral may go in vain because of
the mutations that occur within every two months. Detecting new Chimeric viruses
will be the main concern of scientists soon. Here we introduce COVATOR, A new
software for detecting Chimeric viruses by scanning the virus genome and determine
the main sources of the protein by aligning the input unknown genome against.
COVATOR is user-friendly and python 3+ based software could be running through
only command line from Linux terminal.
