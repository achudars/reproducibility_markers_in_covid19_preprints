SUMMARY
Human monoclonal antibodies are safe, preventive and therapeutic tools, that can be
rapidly developed to help restore the massive health and economic disruption caused by
the Covid-19 pandemic. By single cell sorting 4277 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein specific
memory B cells from 14 Covid-19 survivors, 453 neutralizing antibodies were identified and
220 of them were expressed as IgG. Up to 65,9% of monoclonals neutralized the wild type
virus at a concentration of >500 ng/mL, 23,6% neutralized the virus in the range of 100 –
500 ng/mL and 9,1% had a neutralization potency in the range of 10 – 100 ng/mL. Only
1,4% neutralized the authentic virus with a potency of 1-10 ng/mL. We found that the most
potent neutralizing antibodies are extremely rare and recognize the RBD, followed in
potency by antibodies that recognize the S1 domain, the S-protein trimeric structure and
the S2 subunit. The three most potent monoclonal antibodies identified were able to
neutralize the wild type and D614G mutant viruses with less than 10 ng/mL and are good
candidates for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic tools against SARS-CoV-2.

INTRODUCTION
The impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, with more than 35 million cases, over 1 million
deaths, 5 trillion impact on the gross domestic product (GDP) and 45 million people filing
unemployment in the United States alone, is unprecedented (Aratani, 2020).
In the absence of drugs or vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social
distancing and quarantine have been the only way to contain the spread of the virus.
These interventions showed to be efficient when properly implemented but not all countries
were able to do so showing the limits of these strategies. The urgency to develop vaccines
and therapies is extremely high. The effort to develop vaccines is unprecedented and
fortunately in October 2020 we already have several vaccines in advanced Phase III
efficacy trials and many others in earlier phase of development. In spite of the big effort, it
is predictable this wave of infection will continue to spread globally and it is likely to be
followed by additional waves in the next few years until herd immunity, acquired by
vaccination or by natural infection, will constrain the circulation of the virus. It is therefore
imperative to develop in parallel both vaccines and therapeutic tools to face the next waves
of SARS-CoV-2 infections as soon as possible. Among the many therapeutic options
available, human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are the ones that can be developed in the
shortest period of time. In fact, the extensive clinical experience with the safety of more
than 50 commercial mAbs approved to treat cancer, inflammatory and autoimmune,
disorders provides high confidence on their safety. These advantages, combined with the
urgency of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, support and justify an accelerated regulatory
pathway. In addition, the long industrial experience in developing and manufacturing mAbs
decreases the risks usually associated with the technical development of investigational
products. Finally, the incredible technical progress in the field allows to shorten the
conventional timelines and go from discovery to proof of concept trials in 5-6 months
(Kelley, 2020). Indeed, in the case of Ebola, mAbs were the first therapeutic intervention

recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and they were developed faster
than vaccines or other drugs (Kupferschmidt, 2019).
The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S-protein) has a pivotal role in viral pathogenesis
and it is considered the main target to elicit potent neutralizing antibodies and the focus for
the development of therapeutic and prophylactic tools against this virus (Walls et al., 2020,
Tay et al., 2020). Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is mediated by the interaction
between S-protein and the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Wang et al.,
2020b, Walls et al., 2020). The S-protein is a trimeric class I viral fusion protein which
exists in a metastable prefusion conformation and in a stable postfusion state. Each Sprotein monomer is composed of two distinct regions, the S1 and S2 subunits. Structural
rearrangement occurs when the receptor binding domain (RBD) present in the S1 subunit
binds to the host cell membrane. This interaction destabilizes the prefusion state of the Sprotein triggering the transition into the postfusion conformation which in turn results in the
ingress of the virus particle into the host cell (Wrapp et al., 2020). Single-cell RNAsequencing analysis revealed that ACE2 expression was ubiquitous in different human
organs have suggesting that SARS-CoV-2, through the S-protein, can invade human cells
in different major physiological systems including the respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive
and urinary systems, thus enhancing the possibility of spreading and infection (Zou et al.,
2020).
During the first few months of this pandemic, several groups have been active in isolating
and characterizing human monoclonal antibodies from Covid-19 convalescent patients or
from humanized mice and some of them have been progressing quickly to clinical trials for
the prevention and cure of SARS-Cov-2 infection (Shi et al., 2020, Hansen et al., 2020,
Wang et al., 2020a, Pinto et al., 2020, Zost et al., 2020, Rogers et al., 2020, Andreano et
al., 2020). So far, most of the work on human monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2
started from one or few patients and it allowed to successfully isolate and characterize the

in vitro therefore grams of antibodies will be needed per single patient. In this scenario
intravenous delivery results to be the only possible administration route for their
therapeutic and prophylactic use. Only recently very potent human antibodies have been
isolated and these can be considered for intramuscular or subcutaneous administration. A
striking example is a monoclonal antibody against RSV which delivered intramuscularly to
premature babies has shown very promising results in clinical settings (Griffin et al., 2020).
Furthermore, giving the initial rush in isolating potential antibody candidates for clinical
development, the whole picture on different types of neutralizing antibodies generated after
infection is not yet clear.
To identify and characterize potent mAbs against SARS-CoV-2, we isolated over 4,200 Sprotein specific-memory B cells (MBCs) derived from 14 Covid-19 convalescent. From the
screening of thousands of B cells, three extremely potent monoclonal antibodies were
identified and are excellent candidates for further development.

RESULTS
Isolation and characterization of S-protein specific antibodies from SARS-CoV-2
convalescent patients
To retrieve mAbs specific for SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) from fourteen convalescent patients enrolled in this study were collected and
stained with fluorescent labelled S-protein trimer to identify antigen specific memory B cells
(MBCs). Fig. 1 summarizes the overall experimental strategy. The gating strategy
described in Fig. S1 was used to single cell sort into 384-well plates IgG+ and IgA+ MBCs
binding to the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein trimer in its prefusion conformation. The sorting
strategy aimed to specifically identify class-switched MBCs (CD19+CD27+IgD-IgM-) to
identify only memory B lymphocytes that went through maturation processes. A total of
4,277 S-protein-binding MBCs were successfully retrieved with frequencies ranging from
0,17% to 1,41% (Table 1). Following the sorting procedure, S-protein+ MBCs were
incubated over a layer of 3T3-CD40L feeder cells in the presence of IL-2 and IL-21 stimuli
for two weeks to allow natural production of immunoglobulins (10). Subsequently, MBC
supernatants containing IgG or IgA were tested for their ability to bind either the SARSCoV-2 S-protein trimer in its prefusion conformation or the S-protein S1 + S2 subunits (Fig.
2A - B) by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A panel of 1,731 mAbs specific
for the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein were identified showing a broad range of signal intensities
(Table 1).

mAbs were able to neutralize the antigen/receptor binding showing a broad array of
neutralization potency ranging from 50% to over 100% (Table 1 and Fig. 2C).
As for the authentic virus neutralization assay, supernatants containing naturally produced
IgG or IgA were tested for their ability to protect the layer of Vero E6 cells from the
cytopathic effect triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. S2). To increase the throughput
of our approach, supernatants were tested at a single point dilution and to increase the
sensibility of our first screening a viral titer of 25TCID50 was used. For this first screening
mAbs were classified as neutralizing, partially neutralizing and not-neutralizing mAbs
based on their inability to protect Vero E6 cells from infection, or to their ability to partially
or completely prevent the cytopathic effect. Out of 1,731 mAbs tested in this study, a panel
of 453 (26,2%) mAbs neutralized the live virus and prevented infection of Vero E6 cells
(Table 1). The percentage of partially neutralizing mAbs and neutralizing mAbs (nAbs)
identified in each donor was extremely variable ranging from 2,6 – 29,7% and 2,8 – 26,4%
respectively (Fig. 3A and Table S1). The majority of nAbs were able to specifically
recognize the S-protein S1 domain (57,5%; N=244) while 7,3% (N=53) of nAbs were
specific for the S2 domain and 35,2% (N=156) did not recognize single domains but only
the S-protein in its trimeric conformation (Fig. 3B; Table S2). From the panel of 453 nAbs,
we recovered the heavy and light chain amplicons of 220 nAbs which were expressed as
full length IgG1 using the transcriptionally active PCR (TAP) approach to characterize their
neutralization potency. The vast majority of nAbs identified (65,9%; N=145) had a low
neutralizing potency and required more than 500 ng/ml to achieve an IC100. A smaller
fraction of the antibodies had an intermediate neutralizing potency (23,6%; N=52) requiring
between 100 and 500 ng/ml to achieve the IC100, while 9,1% (N=20) required between 10
and 100 ng/ml. Finally, only 1,4% (N=3) of the expressed nAbs were classified as
extremely potently nAbs, showing an IC100 lower than 10 ng/mL (Fig. 3C - D; Table S3).

Classification of SARS-CoV-2 nAbs
Based on the first round of screening, 14 nAbs were selected for further characterization.
All nAbs were able to bind the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein in its trimeric conformation (Fig. 4A).
The mAbs named J08, I14, F05, G12, C14, B07, I21, J13 and D14 were also able to
specifically bind the S1 domain (Fig. 4B). The nAbs named H20, I15, F10 and F20 were
not able to bind single S1 or S2 domains but only the S-protein in its trimeric state, while
the nAb L19 bound only the S2 subunit (Fig. 4B - C). Among the group of S1 specific nAbs
only J08, I14, F05, G12, C14 and B07 were able to bind the S1 receptor binding domain
(RBD) and to strongly inhibit the interaction between the S-protein and Vero E6 receptors
(Fig. 2C; Fig. S3; Table 2). On the other hand I21, J13 and D14, despite showing S1
binding specificity, did not show any binding to the RBD and NoB activity (Fig S3 and
Table 2). Based on this description four different groups of nAbs against SARS-CoV-2
were identified. The first group (Group I) is composed by S1-RBD specific nAbs (J08, I14,
F05, G12 and C14) and showed extremely high neutralization potency against both the WT
and D614G live viruses ranging from 3,91 to 157,49 ng/mL (Fig. 4D - F; Table 2). The
second group (Group II) is composed by S1 nAbs that did not bind the RBD (B07, I21, J13
and D14). These antibodies also showed good neutralization potency ranging from 49,61
to 500 ng/mL (Fig. 4D - F; Table 2) but inferior to S1-RBD directed nAbs. Antibodies
belonging to Group I and II showed picomolar affinity to the S-protein with a KD ranging
from 0.78 to 6.30 E-10M (Fig. S4). The third group (Group III) is composed by antibodies
able to bind the S-protein only in its whole trimeric conformation (H20, I15, F10 and F20).
Antibodies belonging to this group showed lower affinity to the S-protein (KD 7.57 E-8M –
6.40 E-9M) compared to Group I and II nAbs and medium neutralization potencies ranging
from 155,02 to 492,16 ng/mL (Fig. 4D - F; Table 2; Fig. S4). The fourth and final group
(Group IV) composed only by L19 nAb and recognized exclusively the S2 domain of the S-

DISCUSSION
This work describes a systematic screening of memory B cells from convalescent people
to identify extremely potent human monoclonal antibodies against the spike protein of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus, to be used for prevention and therapy of Covid-19. We found that
approximately 10% of the total B cells against the spike protein produce neutralizing
antibodies and these can be divided into 4 different groups recognizing the S1-RBD, S1domain, S2-domain and the S-protein trimer. We found that the most potent neutralizing
antibodies are extremely rare and that they recognize the RBD, followed in potency by the
antibodies recognizing the S1 domain, the trimeric structure and the S2 subunit. The L19
antibody against the S2 subunit, which had the lowest neutralizing potency, is
representative of several other S2 specific antibodies identified in the preliminary
screening. From these data we conclude that in convalescent patients most of the
observed neutralization titers are mediated by the antibodies with medium-high
neutralizing potency. Indeed, the extremely potent antibodies and the antibodies against
the S2 subunit are unlikely to contribute to the overall neutralizing titers because they are
too rare and too poor neutralizers respectively to be able to make the difference. The
observed antibody repertoire of convalescent patients may be a consequence of the loss
of Bcl-6-expressing follicular helper T cells and the loss of germinal centers in Covid-19
patients which may limit and constrain the B cell affinity maturation (Kaneko et al., 2020). It
is therefore important to perform similar studies following vaccination as it is likely that the
repertoire of neutralizing antibodies induced by vaccination may be different from the one
described here.
Out of 453 neutralizing antibodies that were tested and characterized three showed
extremely high neutralization potency against both the initial SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated in
Wuhan and the D614G variant currently spread worldwide. During the last few months
several groups reported the isolation, structure and passive protection in animal models of

neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Most of these studies, with few exceptions
report antibodies which require from 20 to several hundreds more ng/mL to neutralize 50%
of the virus in vitro. These antibodies are potentially good for therapy. However, they will
require a high dosage which will result in elevated cost of goods, low capacity to numbers
large quantities of doses and intravenous infusion.
The extremely potent candidates described in our study will allow to use small quantities of
antibodies to reach the prophylactic and therapeutic dosage and as consequence

therefore increase antibodies availability in high income countries as well as low-and

SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic and therapeutic tools worldwide and help the fight against

METHOD DETAILS
Enrollment of SARS-COV-2 convalescent donors and human sample collection
This work results from a collaboration with the National Institute for Infectious Diseases,
IRCCS – Lazzaro Spallanzani Rome (IT) and Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese,
Siena (IT) that provided samples from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors who gave their
written consent. The study was approved by local ethics committees (Parere 18_2020 in
Rome and Parere 17065 in Siena) and conducted according to good clinical practice in
accordance with the declaration of Helsinki (European Council 2001, US Code of Federal
Regulations, ICH 1997). This study was unblinded and not randomized.

Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolation from SARS-CoV-2
convalescent donors
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from heparin-treated whole
blood by density gradient centrifugation (Lympholyte-H; Cedarlane). After separation,
PBMC were: i) frozen in liquid nitrogen at concentration of 10 x 10 6 PBMC/vial using 10%
DMSO in heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) or ii) resuspended in RPMI 1640
(EuroClone) supplemented with 10% FBS (EuroClone), 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 2 mmol/L
penicillin, and 50 µg/mL streptomycin (EuroClone). Cells were cultured for 18 hour at 37°C
with 5% CO2. Blood samples were screened for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and for antibodies
against HIV, HBV and HCV.

Expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein prefusion trimer

use.

Single cell sorting of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein+ memory B cells
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent
donors were stained with Live/Dead Fixable Aqua (Invitrogen; Thermo Scientific) in 100 µL
final volume diluted 1:500 at room temperature (RT). After 20 min incubation cells were
washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and unspecific bindings were saturated with
50 µL of 20% rabbit serum in PBS. Following 20 min incubation at 4°C cells were washed
with PBS and stained with SARS-CoV-2 S-protein labeled with Strep-Tactin®XT DY-488
(iba-lifesciences cat# 2-1562-050) for 30 min at 4°C. After incubation the following staining
mix was used CD19 V421 (BD cat# 562440), IgM PerCP-Cy5.5 (BD cat# 561285), CD27
PE (BD cat# 340425), IgD-A700 (BD cat# 561302), CD3 PE-Cy7 (BioLegend cat#
300420), CD14 PE-Cy7 (BioLegend cat# 301814), CD56 PE-Cy7 (BioLegend cat#
318318) and cells were incubated at 4°C for additional 30 min. Stained MBCs were single
cell-sorted with a BD FACSAria III (BD Biosciences) into 384-well plates containing 3T3CD40L feeder cells and were incubated with IL-2 and IL-21 for 14 days as previously
described (Huang et al., 2013).

ELISA assay with S1 and S2 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein
The presence of S1- and S2-binding antibodies in culture supernatants of monoclonal Sprotein-specific memory B cells was assessed by means of an ELISA assay implemented
with the use of a commercial kit (ELISA Starter Accessory Kit, Catalogue No. E101; Bethyl
Laboratories). Briefly, 384-well flat-bottom microtiter plates (Nunc MaxiSorp 384-well
plates; Sigma-Aldrich) were coated with 25 µl/well of antigen (1:1 mix of S1 and S2
subunits, 1 µg/ml each; The Native Antigen Company, Oxford, United Kingdom) diluted in

coating buffer (0.05 M carbonate-bicarbonate solution, pH 9.6), and incubated overnight at
4°C. The plates were then washed three times with 100 µl/well washing buffer (50 mM Tris
Buffered Saline (TBS) pH 8.0, 0.05% Tween-20) and saturated with 50 µl/well blocking
buffer containing Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) (50 mM TBS pH 8.0, 1% BSA, 0.05%
Tween-20) for 1 hour (h) at 37°C. After further washing, samples diluted 1:5 in blocking
buffer were added to the plate. Blocking buffer was used as a blank. After an incubation of
1 h at 37°C, plates were washed and incubated with 25 µl/well secondary antibody
(horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG-Fc Fragment polyclonal
antibody, diluted 1:10,000 in blocking buffer, Catalogue No. A80-104P; (Bethyl
Laboratories) for 1 h at 37°C. After three washes, 25 µl/well TMB One Component HRP
Microwell Substrate (Bethyl Laboratories) was added and incubated 10–15 minutes at RT
in the dark. Color development was terminated by addition of 25 µl/well 0.2 M H 2SO4.
Absorbance was measured at 450 nm in a Varioskan Lux microplate reader (Thermo
Fisher Scientific). The threshold for sample positivity was set at twice the optical density
(OD) of the blank.

ELISA assay with SARS-CoV-2 S-protein prefusion trimer
ELISA assay was used to detect SARS-CoV-2 S-protein specific mAbs and to screen
plasma from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent donors. 384-well plates (Nunc MaxiSorp 384 well
plates; Sigma Aldrich) were coated with 3µg/mL of streptavidin diluted in PBS and
incubated at RT overnight. Plates were then coated with SARS-CoV-2 S-protein at 3µg/mL
and incubated for 1h at room temperature. 50 µL/well of saturation buffer (PBS/BSA 1%)
was used to saturate unspecific binding and plates were incubated at 37°C for 1h without
CO2. Supernatants were diluted 1:5 in PBS/BSA 1%/Tween20 0,05% in 25 µL/well final
volume and incubated for 1h at 37°C without CO2. 25 µL/well of alkaline phosphataseconjugated goat anti-human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) and IgA (Jackson Immuno Research)

were used as secondary antibodies. In addition, twelve two-fold serial dilutions of plasma
from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were analyzed in duplicate. Plasma samples were
diluted in PBS/BSA 1%/Tween20 0,05% (25 µL/well final volume; Starting Dilution 1:80)
and incubated for 1h at 37°C without CO2. Next, 25 µL/well of alkaline phosphataseconjugated goat anti-human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) was added for 1h at 37°C without CO2.
Wells were washed three times between each step with PBS/BSA 1%/Tween20 0.05%.
PNPP (p-nitrophenyl phosphate) (Thermo Fisher) was used as soluble substrate to detect
SARS-CoV-2 S-protein specific monoclonal antibodies and the final reaction was
measured by using the Varioskan Lux Reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a wavelength
of 405 nm. Samples were considered as positive if OD at 405 nm (OD405) was two times
the blank.

SARS-CoV-2 virus and cell infection
African green monkey kidney cell line Vero E6 cells (American Type Culture Collection
[ATCC] #CRL-1586) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) - High
Glucose (Euroclone, Pero, Italy) supplemented with 2 mM L- Glutamine (Lonza, Milano,
Italy), penicillin (100 U/mL) - streptomycin (100 µg/mL) mixture (Lonza, Milano, Italy) and
10% Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Euroclone, Pero, Italy). Cells were maintained at 37°C,
in a 5% CO2 humidified environment and passaged every 3-4 days.
Wild type SARS CoV-2 2019 (2019-nCoV strain 2019-nCov/Italy-INMI1) virus was
purchased from the European Virus Archive goes Global (EVAg, Spallanzani Institute,
Rome). For virus propagation, sub-confluent Vero E6 cell monolayers were prepared in
T175 flasks (Sarstedt) containing supplemented D-MEM high glucose medium. For titration
and neutralization tests of SARS-CoV-2, Vero E6 were seeded in 96-well plates (Sarstedt)
at a density of 1,5x104 cells/well the day before the assay.

Neutralization of Binding (NoB) Assay
To study the binding of the Covid-19 Spike protein to cell-surface receptor(s) we developed
an assay to assess recombinant Spike protein specific binding to target cells and
neutralization thereof. To this aim the stabilized Spike protein was coupled to StreptavidinPE (eBioscience # 12-4317-87, Thermo Fisher) for 1h at room temperature and then
incubated with VERO E6 cells. Binding was assessed by flow cytometry. The stabilized
Spike protein bound VERO E6 cells with high affinity (data not shown). To assess the
content of neutralizing antibodies in sera or in B-cell culture supernatants, two microliters
of SARS-CoV-2 Spike-Streptavidin-PE at 5-10 µg/ml in PBS-5%FCS were mixed with two
microliters of various dilutions of sera or B-cell culture supernatants in U bottom 96-well
plates. After incubation at 37°C for 1 hr, 30x103 Vero E6 cells suspended in two microliters
of PBS 5% FCS were added and incubated for additional 45 min at 4°C. Non-bound
protein and antibodies were removed and cell-bound PE-fluorescence was analyzed with a
FACScantoII flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Data were analyzed using the FlowJo
data analysis software package (TreeStar, USA). The specific neutralization was
calculated as follows: NOB (%) = 1 – (Sample MFI value – background MFI value) /
(Negative Control MFI value – background MFI value).

Single cell RT-PCR and Ig gene amplification
From the original 384-well sorting plate, 5 µL of cell lysate was used to perform RT-PCR.
Total RNA from single cells was reverse transcribed in 25 µL of reaction volume composed
by 1 µL of random hexamer primers (50 ng/µL), 1 µL of dNTP-Mix (10 mM), 2 µL 0.1 M
DTT, 40U/µL RNAse OUT, MgCl2 (25 mM), 5x FS buffer and Superscript® IV reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen). Final volume was reached by adding nuclease-free water
(DEPC). Reverse transcription (RT) reaction was performed at 42°C/10’, 25°C/10’,
50°C/60’ and 94°/5’. Heavy (VH) and light (VL) chain amplicons were obtained via two

rounds of PCR. All PCR reactions were performed in a nuclease-free water (DEPC) in a
total volume of 25 µL/well. Briefly, 4 µL of cDNA were used for the first round of PCR
(PCRI). PCRI-master mix contained 10 µM of VH and 10 µM VL primer-mix ,10mM dNTP
mix, 0,125 µL of Kapa Long Range Polymerase (Sigma), 1,5 µL MgCl2 and 5 µL of 5x
Kapa Long Range Buffer. PCRI reaction was performed at 95°/3’, 5 cycles at 95°C/30’’,
57°C/30’’, 72°C/30’’ and 30 cycles at 95°C/30’’, 60°C/30’’, 72°C/30’’ and a final extension
of 72°/2’. All nested PCR reactions (PCRII) were performed using 3,5 μL of unpurified
PCRI product using the same cycle conditions. PCRII products were then purified by
Millipore MultiScreen® PCRμ96 plate according to manufacture instructions. Samples
were eluted with 30 μl nuclease-free water (DEPC) into 96-well plates and quantify by
Qubit Fluorometric Quantitation assay (Invitrogen).

Cloning of variable region genes and recombinant antibody expression
Vector digestions were carried out with the respective restriction enzymes AgeI, SalI and
Xho as previously described (Tiller et al., 2008, Wardemann and Busse, 2019). Briefly, 75
ng of IgH, Igλ and Igκ purified PCRII products were ligated by using the Gibson Assembly
NEB into 25 ng of respective human Igγ1, Igκ and Igλ expression vectors. The reaction
was performed into 5 μL of total volume. Ligation product was 10-fold diluted in nucleasefree water (DEPC) and used as template for transcriptionally active PCR (TAP) reaction
which allowed the direct use of linear DNA fragments for in vitro expression. The entire
process consists of one PCR amplification step, using primers to attach functional
promoter (human CMV) and terminator sequences (SV40) onto the fragment PCRII
products. TAP reaction was performed in a total volume of 25 μL using 5 μL of Q5
polymerase (NEB), 5 μL of GC Enhancer (NEB), 5 μL of 5X buffer,10 mM dNTPs, 0,125 µL
of forward/reverse primers and 3 μL of ligation product. TAP reaction was performed by
using the following cycles: 98°/2’, 35 cycles 98°/10’’, 61°/20’’, 72°/1’ and 72°/5’ as final

extention step. TAP products were purified under the same PCRII conditions, quantified by
Qubit Fluorometric Quantitation assay (Invitrogen) and used for transient transfection in
Expi293F cell line using manufacturing instructions.

Viral propagation and titration
The SARS-CoV-2 virus was propagated in Vero E6 cells cultured in DMEM high Glucose
supplemented with 2% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin. Cells were
seeded at a density of 1x106 cells/mL in T175 flasks and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for
18-20 hours. The sub-confluent cell monolayer was then washed twice with sterile
Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS). Cells were inoculated with 3,5 mL of the
virus properly diluted in DMEM 2% FBS at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001, and
incubated for 1h at 37°C in a humidified environment with 5% CO 2. At the end of the
incubation, 50 mL of DMEM 2% FBS were added to the flasks. The infected cultures were
incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 and monitored daily until approximately 80-90% of the cells
exhibited cytopathic effect (CPE). Culture supernatants were then collected, centrifuged at
4°C at 1,600 rpm for 8 minutes to allow removal of cell debris, aliquoted and stored at 80°C as the harvested viral stock. Viral titers were determined in confluent monolayers of
Vero E6 cells seeded in 96-well plates using a 50% tissue culture infectious dose assay
(TCID50). Cells were infected with serial 1:10 dilutions (from 10-1 to 10-11) of the virus and
incubated at 37°C, in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2. Plates were monitored daily
for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 induced CPE for 4 days using an inverted optical
microscope. The virus titer was estimated according to Spearman-Karber formula (Kundi,
1999) and defined as the reciprocal of the highest viral dilution leading to at least 50% CPE
in inoculated wells.

SARS-CoV-2 authentic virus neutralization assay
The neutralization activity of culture supernatants from monoclonal was evaluated using a
CPE-based assay as previously described (Manenti et al., 2020). S-protein-specific
memory B cells was initially evaluated by means of a qualitative live-virus based
neutralization assay against a one-point dilution of the samples. Supernatants were mixed
in a 1:3 ratio with a SARS-CoV-2 viral solution containing 25TCID50 of virus (final volume:
30 µl). After 1 hour incubation at 37°C, 5% CO 2, 25 µl of each virus-supernatant mixture
was added to the wells of a 96-well plate containing a sub-confluent Vero E6 cell
monolayer. Following a 2-hour incubation at 37°C, the virus-serum mixture was removed
and 100 µl of DMEM 2% FBS were added to each well. Plates were incubated for 3 days at
37°C in a humidified environment with 5% CO2, then examined for CPE by means of an
inverted optical microscope. Absence or presence of CPE was defined by comparison of
each well with the positive control (plasma sample showing high neutralizing activity of
SARS-CoV-2 in infected Vero E6 cells) and negative control (human serum sample
negative for SARS-CoV-2 in ELISA and neutralization assays). Following expression as
full-length IgG1 recombinant antibodies were quantitatively tested for their neutralization
potency against both the wild type and D614G strains. The assay was performed as
previously described but using a viral titer of 100TCID 50. Antibodies were prepared at a
starting concentration of 20 µg/mL and diluted step 1:2. Technical triplicates were
performed for each experiment.

Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Antibodies binding by Flow cytometry
Flow cytometry analysis was performed to define antibodies interaction with S-proteinreceptor-binding domain (RBD). Briefly, APEX™ Antibody Labeling Kits (Invitrogen) was
used to conjugate 20 µg of selected antibodies to Alexa fluor 647, according to the
manufacturer instructions. Then, 1 mg of magnetic bead (Dynabeads™ His-Tag, Invitrogen)
were coated with 70 µg of histidine tagged RBD. To assess the ability of each antibody to

bind the RBD domain, 20 µg/mL of labelled antibody were incubated with 40 µg/mL of
beads-bound RBD for 1 hour on ice. Then, samples were washed with 200 µL of
Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in 150 µL of PBS and assessed with a
FACSCanto II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Results were analyzed by FlowJo
(version 10).

Affinity evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies
Anti-Human IgG Polyclonal Antibody (Southern Biotech 2040-01) was immobilized via
amine group on two flow cells of a CM5 sensor chip. For the immobilization, anti-human
IgG Ab diluted in 10mM Na acetate pH 5.0 at the concentration of 25 µg/ml was injected for
360 sec over the dextran matrix, which had been previously activated with a mixture of
0.1M

1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide

(EDC)

and

0.4M

N-hydroxyl

succinimide (NHS) for 420 sec. After injection of the antibody, Ethanolamine 1M was
injected to neutralize activated group. 10 µl/min flow rate was used during the whole
procedure. Anti-SPIKE protein human mAbs were diluted in HBS-EP+ (Hepes 10 mM,
NaCl 150 mM, EDTA 3.4 mM, 0.05% p20, pH 7.4) and injected for 120 sec at 10 µl/min
flow rate over one of the two flow cells containing the immobilized Anti-Human IgG
Antibody, while running buffer (HBS-EP+) was injected over the other flow cell to be taken
as blank. Dilution of each mAb was adjusted in order to have comparable levels of RU for
each capture mAb. Following the capture of each mAb by the immobilized anti-human IgG
antibody, different concentrations of SPIKE protein (20 µg/ml, 10 µg/ml, 5 µg/ml, 2.5 µg/ml
and 1 µg/ml in HBS-EP+) were injected over both the blank flow cell and the flow cell
containing the captured mAb for 180 sec at a flow rate of 80 µl/min. Dissociation was
followed for 800 sec, regeneration was achieved with a pulse (60 sec) of Glycine pH 1.5.
Kinetic rates and affinity constant of SPIKE protein binding to each mAb were calculated
applying a 1:1 binding as fitting model using the Bia T200 evaluation software 3.1.

Fig. 1. Workflow and timeline for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies identification. The
overall scheme shows two different phases for neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) identification.
The phase 1 consisted in the enrolment of Covid-19 patients (14) from which PBMC was
isolated. Memory B cells were single cell sorted (N= 4,277) and after 2 weeks of incubation
the antibodies screened for their binding specificity against the S-protein trimer and S1/S2
domains. Once S-protein specific monoclonal antibodies were identified (N=1,731) the
phase 2 started. All specific mAbs were tested in vitro to evaluate their neutralization
