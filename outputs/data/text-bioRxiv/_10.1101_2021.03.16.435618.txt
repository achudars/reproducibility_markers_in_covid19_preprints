Abstract

20

Respiratory viruses present major health challenges, as evidenced by the 2009 influenza pandemic and the

21

ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Severe RNA virus

22

respiratory infections often correlate with high viral load and excessive inflammation. Understanding the

23

dynamics of the innate immune response and its manifestation at the cell and tissue levels are vital to

24

understanding the mechanisms of immunopathology and developing improved, strain independent

25

treatments. Here, we present a novel spatialized multicellular spatial computational model of two principal

26

components of tissue infection and response: RNA virus replication and type-I interferon mediated antiviral

27

response to infection within lung epithelial cells. The model is parameterized using data from influenza

28

virus infected cell cultures and, consistent with experimental observations, exhibits either linear radial

29

growth of viral plaques or arrested plaque growth depending on the local concentration of type I interferons.

30

Modulating the phosphorylation of STAT or altering the ratio of the diffusion constants of interferon and

31

virus in the cell culture could lead to plaque growth arrest. The dependence of arrest on diffusion constants

32

highlights the importance of developing validated spatial models of cytokine signaling and the need for in

33

vitro experiments to measure these diffusion constants. Sensitivity analyses were performed under

34

conditions creating both continuous plaque growth and arrested plaque growth. Findings suggest that plaque

35

growth and cytokine assay measurements should be collected during arrested plaque growth, as the model

36

parameters are significantly more sensitive and more likely to be identifiable. The model’s metrics replicate

37

experimental immunostaining imaging and titer based sampling assays. The model is easy to extend to

38

include SARS-CoV-2-specific mechanisms as they are discovered or to include as a component linking

39

epithelial cell signaling to systemic immune models.

Author Summary

41

COVID-19 is possibly the defining healthcare crisis of the current generation, with tens of millions of global

42

cases and more than a million reported deaths. Respiratory lung infections form lesions in the lungs, whose

43

number and size correlate with severity of illness. In some severe cases, the disease triggers a severe

44

inflammatory condition known as cytokine storm. Given the complexity of the immune system,

45

computational modeling is needed to link molecular signaling at the site of inflection to the signaling impact

46

on the overall immune system, ultimately revealing how severe inflammatory conditions may emerge. Here,

47

we created a computational model of the early stages of infection that simulates lung cells infected with

48

RNA viruses, such those responsible for COVID-19 and influenza, to help explore how the disease forms

49

viral plaques, an in vitro analog to lesion growth in the lung. Our model recapitulates in vitro observations

50

that pretreatment of biological signaling molecules called with type-I interferons, which are currently being

51

evaluated for treatment of COVID-19. Analyzing the model, we, can stop viral plaque growth. We found

52

that enhancing certain aspects of the innate immune system, such as the JAK/STAT pathway, may be able

53

to stop viral plaque growth, suggesting molecules involved in this pathway as possible drug candidates.

54

Quantifying the parameters needed to model interferon signaling and viral replication, experiments should

55

be performed under conditions that inhibit viral growth, such as pretreating cells with interferon. We present

56

a computational framework that is essential to constructing larger models of respiratory infection induced

57

immune responses, can be used to evaluate drugs and other medical interventions quickly, cheaply, and

58

without the need for animal testing during the initial phase, and that defines experiments needed to improve

59

our fundamental understanding of the mechanisms regulating the immune response.

Introduction

61

Respiratory virus infections contribute significantly to death rates worldwide. Seasonal influenza virus

62

infection is responsible for 290,000 – 650,000 average annual deaths globally (1), and occasional, highly

63

pathogenic pandemics strains can emerge, such as the 1918 Spanish Flu (2), resulting in significantly higher

64

mortality rates. As of February 16th, 2021,November 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused over 108.3

65

million recorded infections and 2.3 million deaths worldwide (3). Both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 are

66

RNA viruses, and studies of severe SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infections find that impaired innate immune

67

responses correlate with more severe outcomes (4–6). In highly pathogenic infections, aberrant innate

68

immune responses – specifically elevated inflammation and high production of type-I interferons leading

69

to hypercytokinemia (cytokine storm) (7) – are believed to be significant drivers of mortality (8,9).

70

Excessive inflammation exacerbates tissue damage and hinders clinical recovery (10,11). Influenza studies

71

show that immunomodulation can improve infection outcomes. Prestimulation of toll-like receptors is

72

protective against highly pathogenic influenza strains in mice (12), while cell culture prestimulation with

73

type-I interferons prevents viral plaque growth by SARS-CoV (13), SARS-CoV-2 (14), and influenza (15).

74

Nebulized interferon α2b and interferon β are being investigated as an early treatment for COVID-19

75

(16,17). Collectively, these studies demonstrate the necessity of immune response regulation as a means to

76

balance tissue damage from inflammatory responses with viral clearance. However, we cannot currently

77

predict how an individual patient’s immune system will respond to a particular dosage and timing of an

78

immunomodulator. Computational modeling may reveal how complex responses emerge during infection,

79

rapidly identify and optimize treatments, and reveal dynamic insights into immunoregulation during

80

respiratory infection that can drive the discovery and design of immune targeted treatments.

81

Recent computational models have considered many aspects of virus infection induced immune responses

82

(18–21), however, few models describe virus replication and interferon regulation in a cell culture. Ordinary

83

Differential Equation (ODE) based models assume either homogeneity or a compartment based structure,

84

and typically ignore the diffusion of virions and cytokine signaling, heterogeneity of cell response to

85

stimuli, and stochasticity of individual cells’ response (19,22). Many recent models (20,23,24) of interferon

86

response use a simple virally resistant cell state which does not capture interferon stimulated genes’ (ISGs)

87

effect on viral growth (23,24). A spatial model of viral spread and plaque growth (22) mentions the impact

88

of diffusion constants on viral plaque formation, but does not incorporate the cells’ innate immune response

89

to infection and paracrine induced activation, limiting the ability of the model to explain plaque growth

90

arrest due to ISGs.

91

We developed a multiscale, multicellular, spatiotemporal model of the innate immune response to RNA

92

viral respiratory infections in vitro in CompuCell3D (25) (CC3D), with the ability to simulate plaque

93

growth, cytokine response, and plaque arrest. The model of IFN production and virus replication determines

94

the conditions leading to arrest or promotion of plaque growth during the infection of lung epithelial cells

95

with an RNA virus. Plaque growth assays are commonly used to compare virus growth rates across cell

96

lines (22,26), quantify the number of infective agents (27,28), and observe the effects of drugs and

97

compounds on virus spread (29–32). Plaque growth assays seed the virus at low multiplicity of infection

98

(MOI) and allow it to replicate across a sheet of host cells in a cell culture to form visible plaques. Our aim

99

in replicating plaque growth experiments in a spatial computer simulation was twofold. First, generating

100

realistic simulations of physical experiments allows in silico experimentation for cheaper, faster, higher

101

throughput hypothesis testing of more simultaneous outputs than would be experimentally viable (i.e.

102

recording all species, continuous plaque growth and cell state information without staining or

103

photographing). Second, our model replicates familiar biological experimental measurements and imaging,

104

making our results accessible to wet lab biologists.

105

Our model includes two competing mechanisms, viral replication and the host cells’ innate immune

106

response. Viral reproduction consists of the virus production within and export from infected cells, and

107

viral particle spread via diffusion in the extracellular matrix. The host immune response includes interferon

108

production, export, and diffusion, and the initiation of virally resistant cell states via ISGs. The model

109

represents a monolayer of immobile human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs). Each cell contains a

110

separate model of epithelial immune signaling, viral replication and export, and cell death, based on a set

111

of previously calibrated ODEs (33), modified to include species export to the extracellular environment.

112

We adapt an existing model of cell transitions during viral infection (34) between susceptible, eclipse phase,

113

virus releasing, and dead cell states. The extracellular environment allows diffusion of virions to spread the

114

virus and form viral plaques and type-I interferons responsible for spatiotemporal paracrine signaling. The

115

model gives insight into which processes are most important to IFN regulation and arresting the growth of

116

viral plaques in vitro via IFN mediated antiviral cell states. Since epithelial regulation of IFN is an important

117

early regulator of the immune system more broadly, the model could be expanded in future work to account

118

for additional regulation via immune cells.

119

Materials and Methods

120

The multicellular spatial model incorporates an ODE representation of epithelial cell cytokine production

121

in response to RNA virus infection (35) into a field of agents using CompuCell3D (CC3D). This model

122

simulates the replication and spread of virus within a monolayer of epithelial cells, and the cells’ attempts

123

to arrest this viral spread through interferon signaling and ISG induced antiviral states within the cells.

124

Cell States and Rationale

125

Fig. 1 provides a conceptual overview of the model. The model contains cells (agents) in 4 distinct states:

126

uninfected (U), eclipse phase (I1) in which cells can produce IFN and virus replication occurs but there is

127

no viral export, virus releasing (I2), wherein IFN is produced and virions are produced and exported, and

128

dead (D), in which cells do not interact with their surroundings. The transition between each state is

129

stochastic and depends on the cell’s local extracellular field concentration of virus and the health (H;

130

described in Intracellular Model Equations and Rationale) of the cell, and defined by the following

131

equations, adapted from (34):

145

Type-I interferons (IFNe) and viral particles (Ve) diffuse in the extracellular environment.

146

Intracellular Model Equations and Rationale

147

Each cell within the simulation contains a set of differential equations to define intracellular virus

148

replication, IFN response, and cell health. The IFN response is initiated when a cell becomes infected (as

149

described by Eq. 1) and enters the eclipse phase, I1, where virus replication occurs but the export of new

150

virions has not commenced (36). The intracellular virus’ exposed RNA is capable of inducing an IFN

151

response during this phase via cytosolic retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) and cell surface toll-like

152

receptor (TLR) family (37–40) sensor protein (Eq. 4, k11-k13) detection, which leads to the production of

153

interferon α and β. Interferons are critical in activating the innate and adaptive immune responses including

154

processes that suppress local virus replication. Here, interferon α and β are combined into a single

155

representative molecule labeled interferon (IFN). Influenza’s nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) has strong

156

antagonistic effects on multiple stages of the innate immune response (41,42), and near total antagonism of

157

RIG-I. SARS-CoV’s NSp1 has been shown to exhibit similar RIG-I antagonism (43). Research shows an

158

87% conservation of NSp1’s genome between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (13) and RIG-I antagonism

159

in SARS-CoV-2. Thus, RIG-I’s activity was assumed zero for the baseline model.

160

Intracellular IFN (Eq. 4) is excreted to the external environment (Eq. 10), becoming environmental

161

interferon, IFNe. This leads to autocrine and paracrine induction of more IFN and the activation of ISGs

162

(44,45). The level of induction of ISGs is not modeled, but the effect of ISGs on inhibiting virus replication

163

(46) is described by Eq. 9. IFNe leads to the phosphorylation (activation) of STAT (indicated as STATP in

164

Fig 1) through the JAK/STAT pathway, which in turn phosphorylates IRF7 to IRF7P and subsequently

165

increases IFN production.

166

As the cell transitions from phase I1 to I2, viral export begins. The intracellular virus (V) is exported from

167

the cell, becoming environmental virus, Ve. The cell’s viral load impact on the cell’s health (H) is modeled

168

with Eq. 8. As health nears zero, the likelihood of cell death increases dramatically (Eq. 3). When a cell is

169

infected but resistant to infection, the virus may fail to sufficiently impact cell health and trigger cell death

170

(Eqs. 8, 3). In this case, the cell will remain in the I2 state but will not produce additional virions.

Spatial Considerations: Diffusion of Interferon and Virus

179

The final component of the model is the diffusion of environmental interferon (IFNe) and virus (Ve) across

180

the simulated cell culture. Environmental interferon is excreted during the innate immune response by U,

181

I1, and I2 cells, as described by Eq. 10. Environmental virus is exported by I2 cells, represented by Eq. 11.

182

Both species diffuse across the cellular lattice and have first order decay rates. 𝜎(𝑥,𝑦,𝑡) is a spatial operator,

183

indicating that the given species varies by cell (σ) located at lattice index x,y at time t. Each diffusive species

184

is ready by the cell at lattice index x,y before undergoing diffusion at each timestep.

Parameter Determination

189

Most modeled parameters were obtained from the lowest sum-of-squares error resulting from a previous

190

parallel tempering Markov chain Monte Carlo parameterization of an ODE only model (33) to an infection

191

of HBECs with wild-type A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 Influenza A (47). Additional parameters were estimated

192

from results reported in literature (27,48–50). Table 1 gives a comprehensive list of model parameters and

193

their origin. Virus diffusion values vary by 7 orders of magnitude over different media types (22), but the

194

final value was chosen along with an IFN diffusion slightly lower (~0.5 experimental value, 6 times

195

simulated cell diameter) than experimental measurements (48,51) to securely place the baseline parameter

196

set within in a regime of uncontained plaque growth. The cell state transition parameter β (34) was

197

converted from TCID50 day-1 to PFU/mL day-1 for consistency with the IFN model’s prediction of viral

198

load.

Plaque Growth Metrics

202

Viral plaques are visible areas of cell destruction which occur where a virus has spread across a cell culture.

203

The plaque growth speeds of the eclipse phase (I1), virus releasing (I2), and dead (D) phases are used in

204

several analyses. In the simulations, we determine these speeds by seeding a single infected cell in the

205

center of a grid of cells and measuring the total area occupied by each cell state over time. We assume the

206

plaque is circular, with the radius calculated to give plaque growth velocities. Simulations involve

207

probabilistic infection events and stochastic cell transitions, however, the ultimate cell culture fates (i.e.

208

plaque arrest versus uncontained growth) are deterministic. We averaged plaque growth metrics for

209

sensitivity analyses over 20 simulations (S1 Text Fig 6). In experiments, plaque-plaque interference occurs

when two or more plaques grow into the same spatial region, slowing the radial growth of all plaques

211

involved. This paper simulates only growth of isolated plaques.

212

Plaque arrest occurs in vitro under specific conditions. Unlike models in which cells enter a virally resistant

213

state at a fixed threshold of interferon, our model does not include an explicit resistant or immune state for

214

the epithelial cells. Instead, the phenomenon of an antiviral state and plaque arrest arises naturally from the

215

inclusion of ISG antagonism of viral replication in the ODE model (Eq. 6, k72). In our model, sufficiently

high viral loads can overwhelm the cells’ antiviral state, and the resistant state can be lost over time as the

217

cytokine signal decays. Virus releasing (I2) cells die at a rate depending on the cell’s internal viral load.

218

Because the activated JAK/STAT pathway and ISGs inhibit virus replication, the viral load within

219

individual simulated cells may not reach a level sufficient to trigger cell death.

Multicellular Spatial Model of RNA Virus Infection and IFN Response Reproduces ODE

222

Model Dynamics

223

As the spatial multiscale model presented here is predicated on an earlier ODE model, the multiscale model

224

was first tested to see if it could reproduce similar dynamic responses to those obtained from the ODE

225

system. Detailed in the methods, the ODE model was trained to data from HBECs (53) that were uniformly

226

infected with an influenza virus at MOI = 5. The multiscale model was initialized under identical conditions

227

to demonstrate that introduction of a stochastic cell state transition from virus releasing (I2) to dead (D)

228

does not introduce differences between ODE and multiscale representations of the system. Despite

229

homogenous starting conditions, a non-uniform cellular state field (Fig 2A,B) emerges due to the stochastic

230

nature of cell transitions and the spatial patterns produced by IFNe and extracellular virus. The average of

231

each internal species over all cells is compared against the ODEs alone in Fig 2C.

local concentration field which cells are exposed to. Note that differences arise due to a discrete number of

239

cells rather than a normalized population value, from the stochasticity associated with cell transitions (Eq.

240

1-3), and diffusion of IFN and virus in the extracellular environment. Differences are minor due to the

241

homogenous starting conditions and yield the same overall results as an ODE simulation. Simulations are

242

averaged over 20 replicas (S1 Text Fig 6).

243

The average concentrations of intracellular species and viral titer are like those of the ODE only model.

244

Living cell fraction dynamics are delayed in the multicellular spatial model, as the transition from I2 to D

245

is now discrete (whole cells) and stochastic (probability based transitions), rather than continuous

246

(normalized population) and deterministic (ODE rate of death). Under these homogeneous, high MOI

247

starting conditions, the multicellular spatial model, under both a diffusive regime and a perfectly mixed

248

system (data not shown), tracks the ODE model very well. The system is less sensitive to spatial differences

249

under these starting conditions, since all cells are initially infected, fewer stochastic cell state transitions

250

are possible, and complete cell death occurs much earlier than in low MOI scenarios. Since the multiscale

251

model can reproduce ODE system dynamics under well mixed experimental conditions despite the

252

differences in how the models function, the multiscale model serves as a foundation for exploration of the

253

system under novel conditions: an exploration of low MOI conditions and spatially heterogeneous starting

254

conditions which are highly relevant for in vivo organism infections and in vitro plaque growth assays.

Multicellular Spatial Model Recapitulates Plaque Formation and Growth Dynamics

High MOI, or single cycle experiments, are useful for maximal viral titer experiments and determining cell

do not allow for studying viral growth arrest, and are not representative of the conditions of a normal

infection. We wished to explore low MOI, or multicycle growth experiments, in silico. This section serves

260

as an exploration of plaque growth assays, a low MOI experimental technique that was recreated in the

261

multiscale model. A plaque is a visible area of dead or injured cells that form in cell culture and in the lung

262

of infected animal models as the virus spreads from a point of infection. Fig 3 (left) shows multiple plaques

263

in a culture of cells infected with A/Miss/2001 H1N1 influenza virus. To replicate plaque formation in

264

silico, we simulated an experiment starting with a single A/Miss/2001 H1N1 infected cell seeded at the

265

center of a cell culture. Fig 3 demonstrates that the multicellular spatial model can capture the formation of

266

a viral plaque observed in vitro.

271

Next, we explored the model’s plaque growth dynamics. Fig 4A, B show experimentally observed plaque

272

growth (data reproduced from (22)). While the increase in the number of viral particles during infection is

273

typically exponential, plaque growth, as measured by the change in the diameter of the plaque over time, is

274

linear. There are two experimentally defined boundaries of the plaque, namely, the outer edge of the dead

275

cells (equivalent to D in the model) and the outer edge of the infected cells (equivalent to I1 in the model).

276

The model distinguishes eclipse phase (I1) and virus releasing (I2) cells, which is not normally seen in

experimental plaque growth assays. Seeding the simulation with a single initially infected cell, Fig 4C

shows that the multicellular spatial model replicates these experimental observations. A lag phase during

279

which the initially transfected virus is establishing its replication and export is seen both experimentally

280

(Fig 4A,B) and in the simulation (Fig 4C). Fig 4D-F shows virus spread, plaque formation and IFN diffusion

over time. Fig 4G provides cell state trajectories. There is a lag time of 20 hours until dead cells are present,

282

after which the growth in the radius of the dead cells increases linearly. The growth rate of the plaque

283

remains constant until host cells are depleted. A temporary decrease in environmental virions (Fig 4H) and

284

total IFN concentration in the culture (Fig 4I) is exhibited at 18 hours, during the transition from initially

infected cells (I1) to subsequently infected (I2) cells. Neighboring cells are infected starting at 8 hours, and

In summary, our multicellular spatial model of epithelial infection and IFN response recapitulates plaque

302

growth dynamics seen in vitro using the parameters from the source ODE model. The model’s ability to

303

simulate high and low MOI experiments and reproduce phenomena seen experimentally, without any

304

training to these conditions, gives confidence in its predictive capabilities in novel circumstances. The next

305

five sections of Results are based on simulations of plaque growth assays to give spatialized insights into

306

the mechanisms regulating plaque growth, an element missing from ODE and high MOI research.

Increased STAT Activity Leads to Arrested Plaque Growth and Reduces Final Plaque

Diameter

309

The JAK/STAT pathway triggers an immune reaction via paracrine signaling facilitated by cytokines. This

310

mechanism has been implicated in improved H1N1 influenza survival in a murine model (54), and more

311

broadly in host response to SSRNA viruses such as Japanese Encephalitis Virus (55). To assess the impact

312

of STATP activity on plaque growth dynamics, we simulated plaque growth values of k31 (Eq. 2, Table 1),

which represents the ability of extracellular interferons to activate the JAK/STAT pathway, from its

314

baseline value (45.9 μm hr-1, Table 1) by 10 and 100 fold were carried out. For each value of k31, we show

315

the plaque at 80 hours post infection (Fig 5A) and the cell state dynamics over time (Fig 5B). At baseline,

316

unconstrained plaque growth is observed. Values of k31 ≥ 459.22 μm hr-1 (10 times baseline) lead to arrest

317

of plaque growth. Increasing k31 ≥ 4592.2 μm hr-1 (100 times its baseline value) reduces the time it takes to

318

reach plaque growth arrest, resulting in smaller plaques. In all, these results show that modulating STATP

319

activity within the multiscale model can arrest plaque growth and smaller final plaque size.

320

The model asserts that a change in k31 impacts plaque growth rate, as quantified by the rate of change of the

321

plaque at the end of the simulation (Fig 5C). The area under the curve (AUC) of extracellular virus (Fig

322

5D) and environmental IFN produced (Fig 5E) show reduced infection success and a stronger immune

323

response for increasing k31. Values of k31 ≥ 4592.2 μm hr-1 lead to non-physiological unbounded production

324

of IFN, due to the lack of an IFN-mediated cell death mechanism in the model. This limits predictions to

325

qualitative observations, rather than quantitative predictions of viral titer or IFNe concentration. Plaque

326

metrics (Fig 5C-E) demonstrate the magnitude of the immune response and quantify the decrease in overall

327

viral production.

Elevated RIG-I Activity Delays Cell Death and Increases IFN

336

Greater viral inhibition of RIG-I signaling via nonstructural protein production often increases viral

337

infection severity (41–43). We investigated the effects of varying the antagonistic strength on plaque growth

338

dynamics in silico. In all simulations thus far, RIG-I is assumed to be fully antagonized by the invading

339

virus (k11 = 0). We ran single plaque simulations with 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% RIG-I activity relative

340

to the value in an NS1 knockout training simulation using A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (dNS1PR8). At 80 hours

341

post infection (Fig 6A) plaque radius is nearly unchanged in all cases. However, the cell type composition

342

(Fig 6B) changes significantly. Higher levels of RIG-I signaling (larger values of 𝑘11) lead to less cell death

343

(Fig 6C), lower viral titer (Fig 6D), and much greater interferon production (Fig 6E).

352

Final plaque radii remain almost constant as RIG-I activity is varied from 0 to 1. Increasing RIG-I activity

353

over baseline levels delays cell death. This effect originates from greater interferon responses, and in turn,

354

lower viral titers and an increasing occurrence of failed infections which do not lead to significant viral

355

replication or export. We predict that enhancing RIG-I activity and/or reducing nonstructural protein

356

production in an experiment should reduce viral growth by allowing greater cell survival time in which the

357

innate immune response can further propagate.

358

Interferon Prestimulation Arrests Plaque Growth

359

In experiments, prestimulation of cell cultures with type-I interferons, protects against SARS-CoV (13),

360

SARS-CoV-2 (14), and influenza (15). We simulated an infection with such prestimulation by exposing

361

uninfected cells to IFNe, after which a single cell was infected to initiate the plaque. We found that

362

prestimulation under these conditions entirely arrests plaque growth; while the same initial infection in a

363

field of naive cells under identical simulation conditions would result in the infection and eventual death of

364

all simulated cells (Fig 4 C,G). Fig 7A shows that IFN-prestimulation slows or arrests plaque growth. Only

365

the initially infected cell dies, while the proportion of eclipse phase (I1) cells steadily decreases after 20

366

hours, indicating a cessation of new infections (Fig 7B). The extracellular viral load (Fig 7C) also decreases

367

after 20 hours. Extracellular IFN (Fig 7D) indicates an elevated cytokine profile from the prestimulated

368

cells.

375

After prestimulation with IFN, infected cells survive because the viral load remains low, minimizing

376

damage to the infected cell’s health, which remains above the threshold to induce cell death. The persistence

377

of virus releasing cells does not affect whether the plaques arrest or continue to grow, as these cells stop

378

producing virions. This condition is akin to a failed infection event, wherein the ISG effects would prevent

379

the viral replication from occurring.

Relative Diffusion Constants of Interferon and Virus Determine Plaque Growth Dynamics

381

We explored increased interferon diffusion constants, which emulate different media types in vitro (22) or

382

dendritic cell signal amplification in vivo (56). We performed a two dimensional parameter variation of

383

virus and interferon diffusion coefficients. The interferon diffusion coefficient was varied from 54 um2 s-1

384

to 2160 um2s-1 (1.0 to 40.0 times the baseline diffusion constant) and the virus diffusion constant from 54

385

um2s-1 to 216 um2s-1 (1.0 to 4.0 times the baseline diffusion constant). We evaluated the outcome of the

386

simulation by averaging the growth rate of the plaque at the end of the simulation over 20 simulation

387

replicates. If the average growth rate was 0 we classified the parameters as leading to plaque arrest,

388

otherwise we classified the parameters as leading to continued growth (blue). In our simulations an

389

interferon diffusion constant of about 8- to 10-fold times the viral diffusion constant led to plaque growth

390

arrest (Fig 8). The nonlinear boundary between the domains suggests that viral diffusion eventually ceases

391

to be the rate limiting factor in plaque growth and that higher interferon diffusion constants do not saturate

392

the cells’ ability to respond to the infection within the scales investigated. Larger interferon diffusion

393

constants lead to a broader area of protection around an IFN signaling cell, but this protection can be

394

overcome by a greater viral particle diffusion constant.

Sensitivity Analysis Reveals Changing Controlling Parameters Between Regimes

400

To determine how individual parameters affect the growth of plaques we performed local sensitivity

401

analyses for three regimes in parameter space; the baseline parameter set (Table 1), an elevated JAK/STAT

402

signaling regime (k31 = 688.5 μm hr-1, 15 times baseline), and an elevated interferon diffusion regime (DIFNe

403

= 540.0 μm2 s-1, 10 times baseline). For each regime, we ran 20 simulations using the regime’s nominal

404

parameter values. Then, we perturbed each parameter individually ±25%, computed 20 simulations for each

405

new parameter set, and performed statistical analysis on several sensitivity metrics derived from the

406

simulated trajectories. The sensitivity metrics include the percent change from the average of the nominal

407

simulation of the plaque growth rate, the extracellular virus and IFN maxima and AUC of the extracellular

408

virus and IFN. Statistical significance of the change in each metric from their nominal values was

409

determined using a Student’s t-test. Values are reported in the Supporting Information (S1 Text Figs. 7-9).

410

Increasing and decreasing perturbations to the parameter values primarily led to directionally consistent

411

changes in the sensitivity metrics (e.g. if the metric value increased when the parameter was changed by

412

+25%, then the metric value also decreased when the parameter value was changed by -25%). The

413

sensitivity metrics in Fig 9 average the absolute values of the metric for increased and decreased parameters.

423

IFNe.

424

Previous sections demonstrated that variation in multiple parameters could lead to either continuous or

425

arrested plaque growth. The baseline parameter set leads to continuous growth of the plaque. In this regime,

426

STATP’s dephosphorylation (τ3) and induction of IRF7 (k41, k42) and the virus’ rate of production (k71),

427

diffusion (DVe), and nonspecific environmental clearance (c) have large effects on outcomes of the

428

simulation. For example, increasing the viral replication rate and virus diffusion constant lead to faster

429

plaque growth, whereas increasing the virus decay rate in the extracellular environment slows plaque

430

growth. The High JAK/STAT and High IFN Diffusion regimes have arrested plaque growth. In these

431

regimes, the many parameters associated with the activation of paracrine signaling have substantial effects,

432

with higher sensitivity in the High JAK/STAT regime than in the High IFN Diffusion regime. Diffusion

433

constants further from the boundary between the plaque growth and arrested growth regimes, have greater

434

sensitivity to virus associated parameters and weaker sensitivity to IFN associated parameters.

We have explored the spatiotemporal behavior of a multicellular spatial model of the cellular innate immune

437

response to viral infection. To do so, we developed a general approach to adapting an existing ODE model

438

of spatially homogenized dynamics to create a calibrated spatiotemporal model, which has the potential to

439

enable the addition of spatial investigations to many existing ODE frameworks in systems biology.

440

One of the striking takeaways is the bifurcation between plaques growing without limit and plaque arrest.

441

This insight into the bifurcation between uncontained plaque growth and plaque arrest would be impossible

442

without a spatial aspect present in the model and can be readily understood as a metric of disease

443

progression and severity. We demonstrated plaque arrest under elevated interferon diffusion (Fig 8),

444

elevated paracrine signaling (Fig 5), and interferon prestimulation (Fig 7).

445

This model demonstrates the dramatic dependence of cell culture fate on interferon and virus diffusion,

446

shown in Fig 8. Increased interferon diffusion results in a limited viral plaque by initiating IFN production

447

and ISG effects in a larger local neighborhood of cells. The resulting antiviral state is an emergent property

448

of the interactions between multiple biological scales: spatial propagation of infection and cytokine signal

449

in the extracellular environment and intracellular transduction of IFN signaling, rather than the traditional

450

transition of cells to a distinct virally resistant state. Our model consistently predicts a low viral titer in the

451

dead cell region of plaques, shown in Fig 4D. This could be explained as an evolutionary strategic

452

adaptation; infectious particles in this region do not contribute to the replication of the virus. Instead, viral

453

particles with high enough diffusion only to reach new hosts, both at the tissue level and in the

454

epidemiological sense, maximize the reproductive success of the virus given limited host resources for

455

replication. In response, the hosts’ production of signaling cytokines (Fig 4F) are concentrated primarily

456

near the site of infected cells which are actively producing virus, attracting immune cells to the wave front

457

of infection via chemotaxis rather than allocating resources to the cellular debris in the center of the plaque.

458

In vivo, virus and IFN don’t diffuse passively, due to cilia action, periciliary fluid, and mucosal layer driven

459

advection. We will explore these active transport mechanisms in future work.

460

Elevating STATP activity, as affected by k31 and explored in Fig 5, can lead to non-physiologically high

461

IFN production. This case can lead to cells remaining in the I2 state without producing additional virions.

462

Biologically, these cells may be reinfected or undergo cytokine-induced programmed cell death, but these

463

outcomes were not within the scope of the model presented here. However, which of the two outcomes is

464

reached by the simulation, i.e. arrest or continued growth of plaques, is unaffected and qualitative

465

observations can still be made regardless of the unbounded IFN production. In future work, we will consider

466

mechanisms to cut off IFN production in a physiologically meaningful way and model immune cells and

467

drug interactions.

468

Our IFN pretreatment results can explain early clinical results which show inhaled interferon β as a

469

promising treatment for COVID-19 (57,58). A tenfold increase in interferon production over the baseline

470

parameters of the model is within biological possibility. Our model is based on data from HBECs, which

471

have a limited capacity for cytokine signaling comparable to in vivo production from infected epithelial

472

tissue. The recruitment of dendritic cells and their resulting signal amplification (59) in vivo in the local

473

area of infection could create regions of elevated IFN and cells in an antiviral state induced by ISGs, and

474

the clearance of infected cells and free viral particles by other immune cell classes would limit viral spread

475

compared to a culture of purely HBECs.

476

The multicellular model presented here serves as a jumping off point for integration with immune cell

477

action and other aspects of the body’s response to infection, as the spatial cytokine information could be

478

used for chemotaxis and adaptive immune cell responses. It is our hope to carry these out collaboratively,

479

with the goal of understanding severe SARS-CoV-2 infections and accelerating treatment development by

480

simulating interventional strategies. Targeted experiments can bolster model predictions, and in turn inform

481

experiments in a positive feedback loop between clinical data, experiment, and computational work.

482

Finally, the methodology of creating data calibrated multiscale models in CompuCell3D based on existing

483

ODE or rule-based systems holds enormous potential for investigating the spatial aspect of biological

484

systems.
