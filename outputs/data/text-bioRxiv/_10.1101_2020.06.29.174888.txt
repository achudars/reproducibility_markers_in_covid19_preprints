ABSTRACT
SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells will likely prove critical for long-term immune
protection against COVID-19. We systematically mapped the functional and
phenotypic landscape of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in a large cohort of
unexposed individuals as well as exposed family members and individuals with acute
or convalescent COVID-19. Acute phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells displayed a
highly activated cytotoxic phenotype that correlated with various clinical markers of
disease severity, whereas convalescent phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were
polyfunctional and displayed a stem-like memory phenotype. Importantly, SARS-CoV2-specific T cells were detectable in antibody-seronegative family members and
individuals with a history of asymptomatic or mild COVID-19. Our collective dataset
shows that SARS-CoV-2 elicits robust memory T cell responses akin to those
observed in the context of successful vaccines, suggesting that natural exposure or
infection may prevent recurrent episodes of severe COVID-19 also in seronegative
individuals.

INTRODUCTION
The world changed in December 2019 with the emergence of a new zoonotic
pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which
causes a variety of clinical syndromes collectively termed coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). At present, there is no vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, and the excessive
inflammation associated with severe COVID-19 can lead to respiratory failure, septic
shock, and ultimately, death (Guan et al., 2020; Wolfel et al., 2020; Wu and McGoogan,
2020). The overall mortality rate is 0.5–3.5% (Guan et al., 2020; Wolfel et al., 2020;
Wu and McGoogan, 2020). However, most people seem to be affected less severely
and either remain asymptomatic or develop only mild symptoms during COVID-19 (He
et al., 2020b; Wei et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020). It will therefore be critical in light of
the ongoing pandemic to determine if people with milder forms of COVID-19 develop
robust immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
Global efforts are currently underway to map the determinants of immune protection
against SARS-CoV-2. Recent data have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection generates
near-complete protection against rechallenge in rhesus macaques (Chandrashekar et
al., 2020), and similarly, there is limited evidence of reinfection in humans with
previously documented COVID-19 (Kirkcaldy et al., 2020). Further work is therefore
required to define the mechanisms that underlie these observations and evaluate the
durability of protective immune responses elicited by primary infection with SARSCoV-2. Most correlative studies of immune protection against SARS-CoV-2 have
focused on the induction of neutralizing antibodies (Hotez et al., 2020; Robbiani et al.,
2020; Seydoux et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). However, antibody responses are not
detectable in all patients, especially those with less severe forms of COVID-19 (Long
et al., 2020; Mallapaty, 2020; Woloshin et al., 2020). Previous work has also shown
that memory B cell responses tend to be short-lived after infection with SARS-CoV-1
(Channappanavar et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2011). In contrast, memory T cell responses
can persist for many years (Nina Le Bert, 2020; Tang et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2006)
and, in mice, protect against lethal challenge with SARS-CoV-1 (Channappanavar et
al., 2014).
SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells have been identified in humans (Grifoni et al., 2020; Ni
et al., 2020). It has nonetheless remained unclear to what extent various features of
the T cell immune response associate with antibody responses and the clinical course
of acute and convalescent COVID-19. To address this knowledge gap, we
characterized SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in outcome-defined

cohorts of donors (total n = 203) from Sweden, which has used a more “open” strategy,
and as such durable spread, of COVID-19 than many other countries in Europe (Habib,
2020).

RESULTS
Our preliminary analyses showed that the absolute numbers and relative frequencies
of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were unphysiologically low in patients with acute moderate
or severe COVID-19 (Figure 1A and Figure S2A, B). This finding has been reported
previously (He et al., 2020a; Liu et al., 2020). We then used a 31-parameter flow
cytometry panel to assess the phenotypic landscape of these immune perturbations in
direct comparisons with healthy blood donors and individuals who had recovered from
asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 acquired early during the pandemic (February to March
2020). Unbiased principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a clear segregation
between memory T cells from patients with acute moderate or severe COVID-19 and
memory T cells from convalescent individuals and healthy blood donors (Figure 1B),
driven largely by the expression of CD38, CD69, Ki-67, and programmed cell death
protein 1 (PD-1) in the CD4+ compartment and by the expression of CD38, CD39,
CD69, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), human leukcoyte
antigen (HLA)-DR, Ki-67, lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3), and T cell
immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing protein 3 (TIM-3) in the CD8+
compartment (Figure 1B, C and Figure S2C).
To extend these findings, we concatenated all memory CD4+ T cells (Figure S3A) and
memory CD8+ T cells (Figure 1D) from healthy blood donors, convalescent individuals,
and patients with acute moderate or severe COVID-19 via Uniform Manifold
Approximation and Projection (UMAP). Distinct topographical clusters were apparent
in each group (Figure 1D and S3A). In particular, memory CD4+ T cells (Figure S3A)
and memory CD8+ T cells (Figure 1D) from patients with acute moderate or severe
COVID-19 expressed a distinct cluster of markers associated with activation and the
cell cycle, including CD38, HLA-DR, Ki-67, and PD-1. This finding was confirmed via
manual gating of the flow cytometry data (Figure 1E). Correlative analyses further
demonstrated that the activated/cycling phenotype was strongly associated with
various clinical parameters, including age, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count,
and plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase, albumin, D-dimer, fibrinogen, and
myoglobin (Figure S3B and S3C), but less strongly associated with plasma levels of
various inflammatory markers (Figure S4).
In most donors with acute COVID-19, we observed a pattern of increased CD38
expression, also without HLA-DR, Ki-67 and PD-1 expression (Figure S5A and S5B),
compared to healthy blood donors. We confirmed that CD8+ T cells specific for
cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) expressed increased frequencies

of CD38, indicating that single CD38 expression could be driven by inflammation or
other features in COVID-19 (Figure 2A, B and Figure S5C). Notably though, CMV- and
EBV-specific CD8+ T cells did not express elevated of HLA-DR, Ki-67, or PD-1 and/or
in combination with CD38, during acute moderate or severe COVID-19 compared with
convalescent individuals and healthy blood donors, indicating limited bystander
proliferation and activation during the early phase of infection with SARS-CoV-2
(Figure 2A, B and Figure S5C). Actively proliferating CD8+ T cells, defined by the
expression of Ki-67, instead exhibited a predominant CCR7− CD27+ CD28+ CD45RA−
CD127− phenotype in patients with acute moderate or severe COVID-19 (Figure S5D),
as reported previously in the context of vaccination and other viral infections (Buggert
et al., 2018b; Miller et al., 2008). On the basis of these findings, we used overlapping
peptides spanning the immunogenic domains of the SARS-CoV-2 membrane,
nucleocapsid, and spike proteins to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) from patients with acute moderate or severe COVID-19, and found that
responding CD4+ and CD8+ T cells displayed an activated/cycling (CD38+ HLA-DR+
Ki67+ PD-1+) phenotype (Figure 2C). These results were confirmed using an activationinduced marker (AIM) assay to measure the upregulation of CD69 and 4-1BB (CD137),
which suggests that most CD38+ PD-1+ CD8+ T cells were specific for SARS-CoV-2
(Figure 2D).
In further experiments, we used HLA class I tetramers as probes to detect CD8+ T cells
specific for predicted optimal epitopes from SARS-CoV-2 (Table S2). A vast majority
of tetramer+ CD8+ T cells in the acute phase of infection, but not during convalescence,
displayed an activated/cycling phenotype (Figure 2E). In general, early SARS-CoV-2specific CD8+ T cell populations were characterized by the expression of immune
activation molecules (CD38, HLA-DR, Ki-67), inhibitory receptors (PD-1, TIM-3), and
cytotoxic molecules (granzyme B, perforin), whereas convalescent phase SARS-CoV2-specific CD8+ T cell populations were skewed toward an early differentiated memory
(CCR7+ CD127+ CD45RA+ TCF-1+) phenotype (Figure 2F). Importantly, the expression
frequencies of CCR7 and CD45RA among SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells were
positively correlated with the number of symptom-free days after infection, whereas
the expression frequency of granzyme B among SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells
was inversely correlated with the number of symptom-free days after infection (Figure
2G). Time from exposure was therefore associated with the emergence of stem-like
memory SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells.

On the basis of these observations, we quantified functional SARS-CoV-2-specific
memory T cell responses across five distinct cohorts, including healthy individuals who
donated blood either before or during the pandemic, family members who shared a
household with convalescent individuals and were exposed at the time of symptomatic
disease, and individuals in the convalescent phase after asymptomatic/mild or severe
COVID-19. We detected potentially cross-reactive T cell responses directed against
the membrane and spike proteins in healthy individuals who donated blood before the
pandemic, consistent with previous reports (Grifoni et al., 2020; Nina Le Bert, 2020),
but nucleocapsid reactivity was notably absent in this cohort (Figure 3A and S6A,
S6B). The highest response frequencies across all three proteins were observed in
convalescent individuals who experienced severe COVID-19. Progressively lower
response frequencies were observed in convalescent individuals with a history of
asymptomatic/mild COVID-19, exposed family members, and healthy individuals who
donated blood during the pandemic (Figure 3A).
To assess the functional capabilities of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD4+ and CD8+
T cells in convalescent individuals, we stimulated PBMCs with the overlapping
membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike peptide sets and measured a surrogate marker
of degranulation (CD107a) along with the production of interferon (IFN)-g, IL-2, and
TNF (Figure 3B, C). SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells predominantly expressed IFNg, IL-2, and TNF (Figure 3B), whereas SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells
predominantly expressed IFN-g and TNF and mobilized CD107a (Figure 3C). We then
used the AIM assay to determine the functional polarization of SARS-CoV-2-specific
CD4+ T cells. Interestingly, spike-specific CD4+ T cells were skewed toward a cTfh
profile, whereas membrane-specific and nucleocapsid-specific CD4+ T cells were
skewed toward a Th1 or a Th1/Th17 profile (Figure 3D and S7A, S7B).
In the next set of experiments, we assessed the recall capabilities of SARS-CoV-2specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in convalescent individuals, exposed family members,
and healthy blood donors. Proliferative responses were identified by tracking the
progressive dilution of a cytoplamsic dye (CellTrace Violet; CTV) after stimulation with
the overlapping membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike peptide sets, and functional
responses to the same antigens were evaluated 5 days later by measuring the
production of IFN-g (Blom et al., 2013; Buggert et al., 2014a). Anamnestic responses
in the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell compartments, quantified as a function of CTVlow IFN-g+
events (Figure 4A), were detected in most convalescent individuals and exposed

family members (Figure 4B, C). SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cell responses were
proportionately larger overall than the corresponding SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell
responses (Figure 4D). In addition, most IFN-g+ SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells
produced TNF, and most IFN-g+ SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells produced
granzyme B and perforin (Figure 4E).
In a final set of analyses, we compared the SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody and T cell
responses in and between the different groups. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG responses
against the nucleocapsid and spike antigens were strongly correlated (Figure S8A).
Further analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses
were present in seronegative individuals, albeit at lower frequencies compared with
seropositive individuals (Figure 4F). These discordant responses were nonetheless
pronounced in some convalescent individuals with a history of asymptomatic/mild
COVID-19, exposed family members, and healthy individuals who donated blood
during the pandemic (Figure 4F and S8B, S8C), often targeting both the internal
(nucleocapsid) and surface antigens (membrane and/or spike) of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure
4G). Potent memory T cell responses were therefore elicited in the absence or
presence of circulating antibodies, consistent with a non-redundant role as key
determinants of immune protection against COVID-19 (Chandrashekar et al., 2020).

DISCUSSION
We are currently facing the biggest global health emergency in decades, namely the
devastating outbreak of COVID-19. In the absence of a protective vaccine, it will be
critical to determine if exposed and/or infected people, especially those with
asymptomatic or very mild forms of the disease who likely act inadvertently as the
major transmitters, develop robust adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2 (Long et
al., 2020).
In this study, we used a systematic approach to map cellular and humoral immune
responses against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with acute moderate or severe COVID-19,
individuals in the convalescent phase after asymptomatic/mild or severe COVID-19,
exposed family members, and healthy individuals who donated blood before (2019) or
during the pandemic (2020). Individuals in the convalescent phase after
asymptomatic/mild COVID-19 were traced after returning to Sweden from endemic
areas (mostly Northern Italy). These donors exhibited robust memory T cell responses
months after infection, even in the absence of detectable circulating antibodies specific
for SARS-CoV-2, indicating a previously unanticipated degree of population-level
immunity against COVID-19.
We found that T cell activation, characterized by the expression of CD38, was a
hallmark of acute COVID-19. Similar findings have been reported previously in the
absence of specificity data (Huang et al., 2020; Thevarajan et al., 2020; Wilk et al.,
2020). Many of these T cells also expressed HLA-DR, Ki-67, and PD-1, indicating a
combined activation/cycling phenotype, and expression levels of CD38 in particular
correlated with disease severity, but notably not to a high degree to inflammatory
markers. Our data also showed that many activated/cycling T cells in the acute phase
were functionally replete and specific for SARS-CoV-2. Equivalent functional profiles
have been observed early after immunization with successful vaccines (Blom et al.,
2013; Miller et al., 2008; Precopio et al., 2007). Accordingly, the expression of multiple
inhibitory receptors, including PD-1, likely indicates early activation rather than
exhaustion (Zheng et al., 2020a; Zheng et al., 2020b).
Virus-specific memory T cells have been shown to persist for many years after infection
with SARS-CoV-1 (Nina Le Bert, 2020; Tang et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2006). In line
with these observations, we found that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells acquired an early
differentiated memory (CCR7+ CD127+ CD45RA−/+ TCF-1+) phenotype in the
convalescent phase, as reported previously in the context of other viral infections and

successful vaccines (Blom et al., 2013; Demkowicz et al., 1996; Fuertes Marraco et
al., 2015; Precopio et al., 2007). This phenotype has been associated with stem-like
properties (Betts et al., 2006; Blom et al., 2013; Demkowicz et al., 1996; Fuertes
Marraco et al., 2015; Precopio et al., 2007). Accordingly, we found that SARS-CoV-2specific T cells generated anamnestic responses to cognate antigens in the
convalescent phase, characterized by extensive proliferation and polyfunctionality. Of
particular note, we detected similar memory T cell responses directed against the
internal (nucleocapsid) and surface proteins (membrane and/or spike) in some
individuals lacking detectable circulating antibodies specific for SARS-CoV-2. Indeed,
almost twice as many exposed family members and healthy individuals who donated
blood during the pandemic generated memory T cell responses versus antibody
responses, implying that seroprevalence as an indicator has underestimated the extent
of population-level immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
It remains to be determined if a robust memory T cell response in the absence of
detectable circulating antibodies can protect against SARS-CoV-2. This scenario has
nonetheless been inferred from previous studies of MERS and SARS-CoV-1
(Channappanavar et al., 2014; Li et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2016),
both of which have been shown to induce potent memory T cell responses that persist
while antibody responses wane (Alshukairi et al., 2016; Shin et al., 2019; Tang et al.,
2011). Moreover, vaccine-induced T cell responses, even in the absence of detectable
antibodies,

(Channappanavar et al., 2014). In line with these observations, none of the
convalescent individuals in this study, including those with previous asymptomatic/mild
disease, have experienced further episodes of COVID-19.
Collectively, our data have provided a functional and phenotypic map of SARS-CoV2-specific T cell immunity across the full spectrum of exposure, infection, and disease.
The observation that most individuals with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 generated
highly functional durable memory T cell responses, not uncommonly in the relative
absence of corresponding humoral responses, further suggested that natural exposure
or infection could prevent recurrent episodes of severe COVID-19.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Samples
Donors were assigned to one of seven groups for the purposes of this study. An eightcategory NIH ordinal scale (defined below) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
(SOFA) score were used to assess the severity of the disease at the highest point
(Beigel et al., 2020; Singer et al., 2016). The NIH ordinal scale scores are as follows:
1, not hospitalized, no limitations of activities; 2, not hospitalized, limitation of activities,
home oxygen requirement, or both; 3, hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen
and no longer requiring ongoing medical care (used if hospitalization was extended for
infection-control reasons); 4, hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen but
requiring ongoing medical care (Covid-19–related or other medical conditions); 5,
hospitalized, requiring any supplemental oxygen; 6, hospitalized, requiring
noninvasive ventilation or use of high-flow oxygen devices; 7, hospitalized, receiving
invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO);
and 8, death.
Acute moderate (AM): patients requiring hospitalization and low-flow oxygen support
of 0-3 L/min at sampling (n = 10). These patients had a median score of 5 (IQR 5-5) at
NIH ordinal scale and a median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score
of 1 (IQR 1-1) at sampling. Acute severe (AS): patients requiring hospitalization in
the high dependency unit or intensive care unit, with either low-flow oxygen support of
> 10 L/min, high-flow oxygen support, or invasive mechanical ventilation (n = 17). 14
patients (82%) had required ECMO or invasive mechanical ventilation at intensive unit.
These patients had a median NIH ordinal scale score of 7 (IQR 6-7) and a median
SOFA score of 6 (IQR 3-6) at sampling. Mild Convalescent (MC): individuals in the
convalescent phase after mild disease (n = 40). The majority were not hospitalized
with mild symptoms (78%, n=31), while hospitalized patients had mild-moderate
symptoms requiring either no oxygen support (n=7) or low intermittent oxygen support
up to 1 L/min (n=2). These patients had a median of 1 (IQR 1-1) on the NIH ordinal
scale. Severe Convalescent (SC): individuals in the convalescent phase after severe
disease (n = 26). The median score was 6 (IQR 5-7) on NIH ordinal scale. Exposed
(Exp): family members who shared a household with donors in groups MC or SC and
were exposed at the time of symptomatic disease (n = 30), but without any diagnoses
of COVID-19. These had all NIH ordinal scale of 1. 2020 Blood donors (BD): individuals
who donated blood at the Karolinska University Hospital in May 2020 (during the

pandemic; n = 55). 2019 BD: individuals who donated blood at the Karolinska
University Hospital between July and September 2019 (before the pandemic; n = 25).
Individuals with acute COVID-19 were sampled 5–24 (median 14; IQR 11-17)
days after the onset of symptoms debut and 1-8 (median 5; IQR 3-7) days after
hospital admission (Table S1). All individuals with acute or convalescent disease
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Group MC comprised individuals who had
returned from endemic countries in Europe (mostly Northern Italy) between February
and March 2020 and were among the first cases reported in Sweden. Seven persons
in group Exp were negative for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of positive test for MC or SC
donors, while rest were not tested. Individuals in groups 2020 BD, and 2019 BD were
not tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
All participants enrolled in this study provided written informed consent in accordance
with protocols approved by the regional ethical research boards and the Declaration
of Helsinki. Donor groups and clinical parameters are summarized in Table S1.
Flow cytometry
PBMCs were isolated from venous blood samples via standard density gradient
centrifugation and used immediately (groups AM, AS, MC, SC, Exp, and BD 2020) or
after cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen (group BD 2019). Cells were washed in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
2 μM EDTA (FACS buffer) and stained with HLA class I tetramers and/or a directly
conjugated antibody specific for CCR7 (clone G043H7; BioLegend) for 10 minutes at
37°C. Other surface markers were detected via the subsequent addition of directly
conjugated antibodies at pretitrated concentrations for 20 minutes at room
temperature, and viable cells were identified by exclusion using a LIVE/DEAD Fixable
Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were then washed again in
FACS buffer and fixed/permeabilized using a FoxP3 / Transcription Factor Staining
Buffer Set (eBioscience). Intracellular markers were detected via the addition of
directly conjugated antibodies at pretitrated concentrations for 1 hour at 4°C. Stained
cells were fixed in PBS containing 1% paraformaldehyde (Biotium) and stored at 4°C.
Samples were acquired using a FACSymphony A5 (BD Biosciences). Data were
analyzed with FlowJo software version 10.6.1 (FlowJo LLC). Gating strategies were

PBMCs were resuspended in complete medium at 1 x 107 cells/ml and cultured at 1 x
106 cells/well in 96-well U-bottom plates (Corning) with the relevant peptides (each at
1 µg/ml) in the presence of anti-CD28 (clone L293) and anti-CD49d (clone L25) (each
at 3 µl/ml; BD Biosciences). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry after incubation for
24 hr at 37°C. The following directly conjugated monoclonal antibdodies were used to
detect activation markers: anti-CD69–BUV737 (clone FN50; BD Biosciences) and anti4-1BB–BV421 (clone 4B41; BioLegend).
Trucount
Absolute counts from the different samples were obtained using BD Multitest™ 6-color
TBNK reagents with bead-containing BD Trucount™ tubes (337166) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were fixed with 2% PFA for 2 hours prior to
acquiring. Absolute CD3+ cell counts were calculated using the following formula:
# CD3 positive events acquired ∗ total # beads ∗ 1000
# 𝑏𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑠 𝑎𝑐𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑑 ∗ 𝑣𝑜𝑙𝑢𝑚𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑤ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑒 𝑏𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑑 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑑 𝑖𝑛 µ𝐿
CD4+ and CD8+ counts were computed using their frequencies relative to CD3+ cells.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA were performed in Python, using scikit-learn 0.22.1. Phenotypic data obtained
from

flow

cytometry

for

each

cell

subset

was

normalized

using

sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler and PCA were computed on the resulting zscores.
UMAP
FCS 3.0 data files were imported into FlowJo software version 10.6.0 (FlowJo LLC).
All samples were compensated electronically. Dimensionality reduction was performed
using the FlowJo plugin UMAP version 2.2 (FlowJo LLC). The downsample version
3.0.0 plugin and concatenation tool was used to visualize multiparametric data from
up to 120,000 CD8+ T cells (n = 3 donors per group). The following parameters were
used in these analyses: metric = euclidean, nearest neighbors = 30, and minimum
distance = 0.5. Clusters of phenotypically related cells were detected using
PhenoGraph version 0.2.1. The following markers were included in the cluster
analysis: CCR7, CD27, CD28, CD38, CD39, CD45RA, CD95, CD127, CTLA4,
CXCR5, granzyme B, Ki-67, LAG-3, PD-1, perforin, TCF-1, TIGIT, TIM-3, TOX, and
2B4. Plots were generated using Prism version 8.2.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.).

ELISpot assay
PBMCs were rested overnight in complete medium and seeded at 2 x 105 cells/well in
MultiScreen HTS Filter Plates (Merck Millipore) pre-coated with anti-IFN-g (clone 1D1K; 15 μg/ml; Mabtech). Test wells were supplemented with overlapping peptides
spanning Prot_E, Prot_N, and Prot_S (each at 2 µg/ml; Miltenyi Biotec). Negative
control wells lacked peptides, and positive control wells included SEB (0.5 µg/ml;
Sigma-Aldrich). Assays were incubated for 24 hr at 37°C. Plates were then washed six
times with PBS (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated for 2 hr at room temperature with
biotinylated anti-IFN-g (clone mAb-7B6-1; 1 μg/ml Mabtech). After six further washes,
a 1:1,000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Mabtech) was
added for 1 hr at room temperature, Plates were then washed a further six times and
developed for 20 min with BCIP/NBT Substrate (Mabtech). All assays were performed
in duplicate. Mean values from duplicate wells were used for data representation.
Spots were counted using an automated ELISpot Reader System (Autoimmun
Diagnostika GmbH).
Serology
Serum samples from all donors were barcoded and dispatched to Clinical
Microbiology, Karolinska University Laboratory for serology assessment. SARS-CoV2-specific antibodies were detected using both the iFLASH Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG
chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay against the nucleocapsid and
envelope proteins (Shenzhen Yhlo Biotech Co. Ltd.) as well as the LIAISON SARSCoV-2 IgG fully automated indirect chemiluminescent immunoassay serology assay
against the S1 and S2 (spike) proteins (DiaSorin). The assays produced highly
concordant results (Figure S8A) and have both been shown to generate satisfactory
diagnostic performance as serological SARS-CoV-2 assays (Plebani et al., 2020). An
individual was considered seropositive if one of the two methods generated a positive
result. All assays were performed by trained employees at the clinical laboratory
according to the respective manufacturer standard procedures.
Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed using R studio or Prism version 7.0 (GraphPad
Software Inc.). Phenotypic relationships within multivariate data sets were visualized
using FlowJo software version 10.6.1 (FlowJo LLC). Differences between unmatched
groups were compared using an unpaired t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test, and
differences between matched groups were compared using a paired t-test or the
