Introduction
Since its emergence in 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has effectively evolved accumulating the

deleterious mutations in its genome. Within the last five months, multiple SARS-CoV-2

variants have been detected across the globe which are more transmissible, possibly

escapes the natural and vaccine-induced immunity, and could lead to increased SARS-CoV-

2 infection [1, 2]. Of these, SARS-CoV-2 20H/501Y.V2 (B.1.351) variant is the most dreadful

variant reported to emerge from South Africa in December 2020; however, its earliest

detection was traced back to October 2020. It has been now the most prevalent lineage in

South Africa and has also been reported from 68 countries. B.1.351 variant has 21

mutations with 9 spike protein mutations in the genome. The key mutations beyond N501Y

are E484K, K417N, orf1b deletion in the Receptor binding domain (RBD) and L18F, D80A,

D215G, ∆242-244, R264I, A701V in the N terminal domain [3]. Pearson et al. had estimated

that the B.1.351 variant could be highly transmissible than the earlier circulating strains of

SARS-CoV-2. It has been observed that B.1.351 accounted for about 40% of new SARS-CoV-

2 infections compared to only 20% for B.1.1.7 variant. An in vitro study on the monoclonal

antibodies and convalescent plasma samples of COVID-19 cases demonstrated reduced

activity against B.1.351 compared to B.1.1.7 [4]. The findings of the NVX-CoV2373 clinical

trial have shown post hoc vaccine efficacy of 51% in South Africa where B.1351 was

prevalent [5]. The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 clinical trials results didn’t show protection against

mild-moderate infection with B.1.351 [6]. Besides this, B.1.351 is also reported to be less

With its worldwide occurrence, B.1.351 has been an addition to the gruesome

situation of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. India has also reported the presence of various

SARS-CoV-2 variants such as B.1, B.1.1.7, B.1.1.28.2, and B.1.617.1 [11-14].

A continuous

effort of virus isolation of VOC B.1.351 was made from COVID-19 positive individuals who

traveled from foreign countries to India. Here, we report the isolation and characterization

of VOC B.1.351 from the foreign travelers who arrived in India.

Methods
Clinical specimens
With ongoing process of SARS-CoV-2 screening of travelers from foreign countries

to India, the oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected from 58

individuals with travel history from United Arab Emirates (UAE) (n=39), East and West

Africa (n=10), Qatar (n=5), Ukraine (n=3) and Saudi Arabia (n=1) arrived at New Delhi

International airport in India. All the subjects were asymptomatic and found to be SARS-

CoV-2 positive by real time RT-PCR (Supplementary table 1) [15,16].

Virus isolation and titration
Vero CCL-81 cells were grown to confluent monolayer in 24-well plate maintained

in Eagle’s Minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10 %/ fetal bovine serum

(FBS) (HiMedia, Mumbai), penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). After

decanting the growth medium, one hundred microliter volume of clinical specimens of 58

subjects were inoculated onto 24-well cell culture monolayer of Vero CCL-81. The cells

were incubated for one hour at 37°C to allow virus adsorption, with rocking every 10 min

for uniform inoculum distribution. After the incubation, the inoculum was removed and the

cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The MEM supplemented with

two percent FBS was added to each well. The culture was incubated further in incubator at

37°C with 5% CO2 and observed daily for cytopathic effects (CPEs) under an inverted

microscope (Nikon, Eclipse Ti, Japan) [11].

The virus titration was carried out using the

cell culture supernatants of the clinical specimens displaying CPE in cell culture. Median

tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) value was calculated using the Reed and Muench

method [17].

Results
Virus isolation and titration
Cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed in four out of fifty-eight specimens with the

syncytial formation on post-infection day (PID)-2. The progressive infectivity was observed

with the fusion of the infected cells with neighboring cells leading to the generation of the

large mass of cells on 3rd PID (Figure 1 A). The presence of the replication-competent virus

Clinical history of the cases
All four cases were male, asymptomatic, and belonged to the age group of 27, 32, 42,

and 68 years (Supplementary table 1). None had any co-morbid conditions. All these cases

recovered completely with no new symptoms or complications. Currently, there is no

evidence to suggest that this variant has caused any disease severity in these cases.

Genomic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 isolates
The neighbor-joining tree demonstrated a separate cluster each consisting of two

SARS-CoV-2 sequences; cluster1: MCL-21-H-1195 (EPI_ISL_2014135) and MCL-21-H-893

(EPI_ISL_2014131) and cluster 2: MCL-21-H-1093 (EPI_ISL_2014132) and MCL-21-H-1439

(EPI_ISL_2014133) (Figure 1B). EPI_ISL_2014132 and EPI_ISL_2014133 shared common

mutations at genomic positions A2692T, C5100T, G27870T, and C29358T. Figure 1C

depicts the nucleotide mismatches observed in the isolates. All the four SARS CoV-2 isolate

sequences retrieved had common spike mutation (D80A, D215G, L242_L244del, K417N,

E484K, N501Y, D614G and A701V) (Supplementary table 2). These isolates also have

common mutations in the 5’ UTR (G174T, C241T), ORF1ab (C3037T) and ORF8 (28253).

The L18F and R246I amino acid mutations described by Tegally et al [3] were absent in the

spike protein in each isolate (Supplementary table 2).

The sequence analysis of South African B.1.351 lineage sequences demonstrated the

presence of two different clusters having a deletion of nine nucleotides each in the ORF1ab

(GP:11288-11296)

(GP:22287-22295)

retrieved in this study have nine nucleotides deletion in both ORF1ab and spike region. The

percent nucleotide similarity demonstrated a 99.88-99.96% similarity of the isolates with

the representative B.1.351 lineage sequences (Supplementary table 3).

Discussion
The

in

the

number

of

SARS-CoV-2

infections

necessitates

the

rigorous implementation of the vaccination program and intervention measures such as

hand hygiene, masking, physical distancing and restrictions on public gatherings to curb

the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Besides this, the emergence of these new variants has been a

serious threat to the COVID-19 vaccination program. Hence, it is necessary to determine

the neutralizing capacity of the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 VUI and VOC variants against

the available vaccines. The isolation of B.1351 would be useful to assess the efficacy of the

vaccines rolled out under the national COVID-19 vaccination program of India and also

developing new vaccine, diagnostic or antiviral testing if needed and situation demand in

future.
