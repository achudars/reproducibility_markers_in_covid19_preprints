Abstract
Drug discovery campaigns against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) are beginning to target the viral RNA genome1,2. The frameshift stimulation element (FSE)
of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is required for balanced expression of essential viral proteins and is
highly conserved, making it a potential candidate for antiviral targeting by small molecules and
oligonucleotides3–6. To aid global efforts focusing on SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting, we report
exploratory results from frameshifting and cellular replication experiments with locked nucleic
acid (LNA) antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), which support the FSE as a therapeutic target but
highlight difficulties in achieving strong inactivation. To understand current limitations, we
applied cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and the Ribosolve7 pipeline to determine a
three-dimensional structure of the SARS-CoV-2 FSE, validated through an RNA nanostructure
tagging method. This is the smallest macromolecule (88 nt; 28 kDa) resolved by single-particle
cryo-EM at subnanometer resolution to date. The tertiary structure model, defined to an estimated
accuracy of 5.9 Å, presents a topologically complex fold in which the 5′ end threads through a ring
formed inside a three-stem pseudoknot. Our results suggest an updated model for SARS-CoV-2
frameshifting as well as binding sites that may be targeted by next generation ASOs and small
molecules.
Introduction
Since December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019
(COVID-19), has been a significant global health concern. As of early July 2020, more than 13
million people have been infected and more than 570,000 have died, as reported by the
Coronavirus Resource Center of Johns Hopkins University, and this number is still growing.
Effective vaccines and therapeutic drugs are needed to reduce the severity of the ongoing SARSCoV-2 global pandemic. By early July 2020, 152 vaccines and approximately 300 therapeutic
drugs are being developed worldwide for combating SARS-CoV-2 infection8, though most are
focused on a few targets2. Specific drug design based on protein and RNA structures has been an
effective means of drug development9–11. Three-dimensional (3D) structures of several key
proteins of SARS-CoV-2 have been resolved12–16, but 3D structures of its key RNA elements
remain unknown.

Like all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has a positive sense (+), single-stranded RNA
(ssRNA) genome. Its first open reading frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b encode for SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural proteins, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and partially overlap17.
Optimal viral fitness is dependent on precise stoichiometric expression of ORF1a and ORF1ab
throughout the viral replication cycle17,18 facilitated by an essential regulatory mechanism termed
-1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF). The -1 PRF mechanism is stimulated by a
structured RNA motif at the 3′ end of ORF1a termed the frameshift stimulation element (FSE).
This element directs elongating ribosomes to stochastically shift their reading frames by one base
in the 5′ direction, enabling readthrough past the ORF1a stop codon into ORF1b and maintaining
appropriate levels of ORF1a to ORF1ab expression19.
SARS-CoV-2 has an FSE sequence identical to the original SARS-CoV-1 FSE up to a
single nucleotide substitution20 (Fig. 1a, non-synonymous mutation C13533A; C63A in our
numbering).

heptanucleotide ′slippery site′ UUUAAAC followed by an RNA element hypothesized to form a

original SARS coronavirus FSE3. The SARS-CoV-2 FSE is highly conserved compared to its
genomic context22, with few single-nucleotide polymorphisms arising in recent strains23, all of
which sustain frameshifting in in vitro assays24. Consequently, the SARS-CoV-2 FSE appears
functionally obligate for viral fitness and is predicted to have little evolutionary flexibility to
evolve away from any potential therapeutics25. Supporting its potential as a therapeutic target,
previous studies have shown that changing the FSE sequence leads to loss of viral fitness in SARSCoV-1 and other coronaviruses17,18. While secondary structures required for frameshifting have
been determined by NMR and compensatory mutagenesis25 and probed by chemical mapping26–
28

, experimentally derived tertiary structures remain unavailable for any coronavirus FSE, and the

mechanism of frameshifting remains poorly understood25,27,29,30. Attempts to disrupt frameshifting
by the SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 FSE with peptide nucleic acids and small molecules have
provided leads for drug optimization, but these compounds have given incomplete frameshifting
inactivation and not yet been tested on SARS-CoV-2 in cells5,6.
Here, we report functional and structural results relevant for efforts to disrupt SARS-CoV2 through FSE targeting. We report initial results of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting

SARS-CoV-2 in in cellulo replication assays, complemented by in vitro binding and frameshifting
assays. These results remain exploratory due to the exigencies of university shutdowns and
difficulties of measurements in biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratories, but we hope that release of
these preliminary results will aid SARS-CoV-2 RNA targeting efforts. Then, to facilitate structureguided drug design, we report a 3D structure of an 88-nucleotide SARS-CoV-2 FSE RNA at 6.9
Å by single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), validated by a second cryo-EM
analysis involving a rationally designed RNA nanostructure. The structure shows a tertiary
arrangement in which the 5′ end threads through a ring formed inside a three-stem pseudoknot.
These results reveal binding pockets within the FSE structure and suggest mechanistic insights
that might guide design and optimization of anti-frameshifting SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.
Results
Exploratory targeting of SARS-CoV-2 FSE using locked nucleic acid antisense
oligonucleotides
Previous studies have demonstrated FSE-based inhibition of virus replication with the original
SARS-CoV-1 virus by perturbing the FSE primary sequence17,18 and, with less efficacy, through
peptide nucleic acid ASOs5; however, whether inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 FSE affects viral
replication has not been reported. Here, we explored the efficacy of antisense targeting strategies
against SARS-CoV-2 FSE. Four ASOs modified with LNA bases were designed to hybridize
complementary regions spanning the FSE, termed S2D (Stem 2 disruptor), S3D-1 (Stem 3
disruptor 1), S3D-2 (Stem 3 disruptor 2), and Slp2 (Slippery site 2) (Fig. 1a), along with negative
control LNAs (RL4, JL4, and Scramble; Methods). We evaluated direct ASO-FSE interaction
through in vitro binding and functional experiments. Reverse transcription interference read out
by capillary electrophoresis (Methods) confirmed binding of the four FSE-hybridizing ASO at
concentrations as low as 10 nM, and lack of binding of the three negative control ASOs (Fig. 1b,
Extended Data Fig. 1). Sites of reverse transcription interference, mapped based on sequencing
ladders, appeared near expected locations of ASO hybridization (Fig. 1b). In vitro dual-luciferase
frameshifting assays confirmed inhibitory action of the four ASOs against the SARS-CoV-2 FSE
(Methods and Fig. 1c), leading to up to 5-fold decreases in frameshifting efficiency, with IC50
values of 100-400 nM (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Tests with negative control LNAs RL4 and SL4

against the SARS-CoV-2 FSE and with the S2D LNA against the HIV FSE showed no significant
inhibition at concentrations below 4 μM (Fig. 1c), confirming specificity of ASO-RNA interaction.
In parallel to these cell-free assays, we tested the antiviral potential of FSE-directed LNA
ASOs through cellular assays in the human liver cell-line Huh-7 and the African green monkey
kidney cell-line Vero E6. To evaluate cytotoxic effects of the ASOs, we screened each ASO for
both cellular caspase-3/7 activation, as a measure of apoptotic induction24, and cell viability over
4 days. Nearly all ASOs were insignificant activators of caspase and were not cytotoxic at
concentrations of 100 nM or below (Fig. 1d and Fig. 1e). To test antiviral potency, we measured
the effects of the ASOs on a replicating SARS-CoV-2 luciferase reporter virus (SARS-Cov-2nLuc) under BSL3 conditions. Cells were treated with S2D, S3D-1, and S3D-2 LNAs at a
concentration of 25 nM, well below their cytotoxic concentrations and within the therapeutic dose
range typical of potent LNA inhibitors in cell culture31,32 (Fig. 1e). Compared to the DMSO
control, S2D, S3D-1, and S3D-2 displayed statistically significant virus inhibition by
approximately 4-fold in Huh-7 cells (p < 0.01; Fig. 1f; Extended Data Fig. 2b). These ASO
effects at 25 nM were also stronger than those of 25 nM scrambled LNA negative control and 0.5
μM positive control compound, EIDD-1931 (NHC, β-d-N4-hydroxycytidine33), though current
variabilities in transfection leave these differences statistically insignificant. Similar results, with
less variability between replicates but overall weaker reductions, were observed in Vero E6
African green monkey kidney cells (Fig. 1g; Extended Data Fig. 2c).
These exploratory experiments motivate moving forward with viral replication
measurements involving variation of ASO concentrations, mutagenesis to test specificity, and tests
with Slp2 and other ASOs, which are being scheduled at BSL3 facilities. In particular, we cannot
presently rule out non-specific inhibition by LNA ASO transfection. Nevertheless, taken together,
our binding, frameshifting, and viral replication assays are consistent with FSE as a possible
therapeutic target and provide candidate ASO molecules and assays for follow-on characterization
and optimization. In our cell-free experiments as well as other studies on ASOs and small
molecules targeting SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting5,34, saturating concentrations
of candidate anti-frameshifting inhibitors have shown only partial inactivation (2- to 5-fold),
whereas compounds targeting other viral mechanisms reduce viral replication by 100-fold or more
at high concentrations (5 μM EIDD-1931, Fig. 1f-g). We hypothesized that the partial inactivation
and modest affinity of these targeting efforts so far might be better understood and eventually

overcome if we could achieve a better picture of the tertiary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 FSE,
discussed next.
Cryo-EM resolves the 88-nt FSE
Cryo-EM structure determination of RNA-only systems or macromolecules with molecular
weights under 50 kDa has been accomplished only recently7,35–38, and it was unclear whether cryoEM might be applicable to an RNA as small as the SARS-CoV-2 FSE (28 kDa, 88 nucleotides;
Fig. 1a). Initially, we collected a dataset comprising ~13,000 micrographs. However, the low
concentration of the sample on the grids and the high background of molecular species in the raw
images made it difficult to perform image processing (Extended Data Fig. 3). We manually
selected ~3,400 images out of the whole dataset with the defocus higher than -3 μm with the aim
of achieving an initial 3D reconstruction from ~27,000 manually picked particles (Extended Data
Fig. 3). Subsequently, we optimized the sample preparation and RNA folding protocol to improve
the stability and the concentration of stably folded particles on the electron microscope grids (see
Methods). A dataset with ~10,000 micrographs was collected using the optimized sample
(Extended Data Table 1). Benefiting from the lower background, about one million particles were
selected with the Neural Network particle autopicking option in EMAN239 and were subject to 2D
and 3D image classification in Relion40 (Extended Data Figs. 3 and 4). We selected one class of
images yielding a reconstruction with well-connected density for further refinement. The
reference-free 2D classification of this particle set and its refined 3D map display a shape similar
to the Greek character “λ” (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 3) and the final resolution is 6.9-Å
(Fig. 2b). The B-factor41,42, calculated based on a fitted relationship of particle number and map
resolution, was estimated to be ~726 Å2 (Extended Data Fig. 5). Such a large B-factor could be
attributable to the flexibility of the molecule and/or the limit of particle orientation estimation
accuracy due to its small size. Nevertheless, at the current 6.9-Å resolution, the map still permitted
identification of helical groove features that are hallmarks of RNA (Fig. 2c). The map also showed
non-helical crevices and holes suggestive of potential small molecule binding pockets (Fig. 2c),
as previously observed and validated in cryo-EM maps of SAM-IV riboswitch aptamers with and
without small molecule ligands7,37.

Ribosolve modeling of FSE coordinates
To better understand the FSE tertiary structure, we sought to model RNA coordinates into the 6.9Å map using Ribosolve, a hybrid pipeline recently developed for automatically modeling RNA 3D
structures based on secondary structure information from mutate-and-map guided by nextgeneration sequencing (M2-seq), cryo-EM maps, and computer modeling with autoDRRAFTER7.
M2-seq secondary structure analysis recovered the three-stem pseudoknot in Fig. 1a that has been
validated by NMR and compensatory mutagenesis for the SARS-CoV-1 FSE21. The same threestem secondary structure was also observed in a separate SHAPE-directed modeling study as well
as an independent DMS-MaPseq study27, with minor variations in edge base pairs (Extended Data
Fig. 6). Using the consensus secondary structure of Fig. 2d and the cryo-EM map,
autoDRRAFTER modeling produced an ensemble of ten structures with a mean pairwise root
mean squared deviation (RMSD) of 5.68-Å (Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 7 and Extended Data
Movie 1), corresponding to a 5.9-Å estimated accuracy, based on a linear relationship of precision
and accuracy discovered previously7, with the largest uncertainty in the 5′ end and at Stem 2
(estimated accuracy of >10 Å; Extended Data Fig. 8). The quality of both model ensembles was
also validated using MolProbity43 (Extended Data Table 1). At 5.9-Å estimated accuracy,
individual atomic positions and non-canonical base pairs cannot be confidently assigned.
Nevertheless, the tertiary arrangement of the helical segments and non-helical linkers of the SARSCoV-2 FSE can be traced (Fig. 2), is consistent in different members of the model ensemble, and
is further supported by alternative autoDRRAFTER runs making different assumptions about
secondary structure and initial 3D helix placements (Extended Data Fig. 7).
Overall architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 FSE
The architecture of the FSE involves several interlocking elements (Fig. 2e-f and Extended Data
Movie 1). Starting from the 5′ end and proceeding to the 3′ end, the molecule begins with a 5′
region that includes the heptanucleotide slippery site. The Ribosolve modeling folds this region
into a loose hairpin-like shape closed by G•U wobble pairs. This 5′ end is followed by the first
strand of Stem 1, a long helix in all coronavirus FSE’s. The loop of Stem 1 is also the first strand
of the Stem 2 pseudoknot, which forms a 5-bp helix that hybridizes with its complement at the 3′
end of the FSE. The RNA strand continues from this region to complete the second strand of Stem
1 and doubles back to form a hairpin, Stem 3. After an unpaired segment J3/2, the RNA completes

Stem 2 to close the Stem 1-Stem 2 pseudoknot. Lastly, unstructured terminal nucleotides form a
3′ tail.
Despite the absence of base pairings or direct stacking between Stem 3 and the Stem 1Stem 2 pseudoknot, Stem 3 exhibits a distinct tertiary conformation in relation to the pseudoknot
which, along with the conformationally heterogeneous hairpin at the 5′ end, result in the legs of
the “λ”-shaped map (Fig. 2e-f, Extended Data Fig. 6 and Extended Data Movie 1). Overall,
Stems 1, 2, and 3 form a circular ring with a visually apparent hole (Fig. 2e-f). The 5′ end of the
FSE is connected to the pseudoknot by a linker that passes through this ring. This complex
topology was predicted as a possible FSE fold in two recent, independent 3D computer modeling
studies that include an extended 5′ end44,45. We emphasize that while the fold of the 5′ end appears
poorly resolved and thus may have multiple conformations, the connection point of the 5′ end to
the rest of the structure and its threading through the Stem 1-Stem 2-Stem 3 ring is a consistent
feature in all models in the autoDRRAFTER ensemble (Extended Data Movie 1) as well as in
alternative modeling runs based on alternative FSE secondary structures and different
autoDRRAFTER modeling assumptions (Extended Data Fig. 7). In terms of structural
requirements, the 5′ end ring-threading requires formation of a ~10 base pair helical turn in Stem
1. With fewer base pairs, the 5′ strand of Stem 1 cannot turn fully inside and through the ring.
Supporting the general relevance of 5′-end ring-threading, the length of Stem 1 is ~10 base pairs
or larger in all proposed coronavirus FSE elements22, and de novo modeling of FSEs from bovine
coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus, human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1, SARS-CoV-1, and
MERS all give 5′ ring-threaded models (Extended Data Figure 9).
Validation of the FSE model through RNA nanostructure tagging
The SARS-CoV-2 FSE RNA represents an extreme case for cryo-EM. It is the smallest
macromolecule (28 kDa) so far resolved by cryo-EM single particle analysis at subnanometer
resolution. We therefore sought further independent validation of the map and the Ribosolve
model, particularly to test our inference that Stem 3 comprises a ′leg′ of the λ shape, perpendicular
to the Stem 1-Stem 2 pseudoknot44,45. We rationally designed a variant of the SARS-CoV-2 FSE
termed FSE-ATP-TTR3, which contains an insertion of a clothespin-like nanostructure whose
visualization would test the assignment and orientation of Stem 3 in the FSE map46 (Fig. 3a). For
the tag, we chose the rationally designed ATP-TTR 3 RNA47 based on its known amenability to
cryo-EM imaging7 and on modeling suggesting that its insertion into the FSE would not perturb

either RNAs’ secondary structure, a prediction verified through chemical mapping (Extended
Data Fig. 10).
A dataset containing ~12,000 micrographs of FSE-ATP-TTR3 was collected and resulted
in a 6.4-Å map of FSE-ATP-TTR3 exhibiting the ATP-TTR 3 clothespin-like shape. Additional
density at the end of the clothespin is visible, with a λ-like shape (Fig. 3b-c, Extended Data Fig.
11 and Extended Data Movie 2). The FSE-only map fits into this additional density (Fig. 3d,
Extended Data Movie 2). To evaluate the relative orientation of FSE and the ATP-TTR tag, we
adopted an unbiased method to align the two maps. The orientation of the FSE map was determined
by conducting a rigid body exhaustive search to maximize the correlation between the FSE density
and difference mapping between FSE-ATP-TTR3 and ATP-TTR3 densities independently using
Segger48 and Situs49. The highest cross-correlation was found at the expected site, confirming the
orientation and location of Stem 3 within the FSE map (orange helix, Fig. 3e; Extended Data Fig.
12 and Extended Data Movie 2) and prospectively corroborating the prediction from
autoDRRAFTER analysis of the FSE alone.
Discussion
The urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, recent advances in targeting RNA 3D structures with
ASOs and small molecules, and the identification of the FSE as a potentially well-defined RNA
3D structure in the SARS-CoV-2 genome has generated significant interest in understanding and
targeting SARS-CoV-2 ribosomal frameshifting3,23,27,28,44,45,50,51. Here, we confirmed the ability of
ASOs to invade the SARS-CoV-2 FSE structure and to reduce frameshifting efficiencies in cellfree assays, and we explored the potential for these ASOs to reduce viral replication in cells at submicromolar concentrations. Incomplete inactivation of coronavirus frameshifting and replication
in these and prior studies motivated structural analysis to better understand the FSE. Despite prior
expectations of structural heterogeneity and propensity for multimerization4,45,52, and despite
having a size slightly under that of the previous smallest macromolecule imaged by cryo-EM (28
vs. 30 kDa35), the SARS-CoV-2 FSE gave a 6.9-Å resolution monomer map with recognizably
helix-like elements arranged into a λ-like tertiary arrangement. Automated secondary structure
determination and 3D coordinate building through the recently developed Ribosolve pipeline led
to a model with an intricate fold: the Stem1-Stem2 pseudoknot interconnected by a J3/2 linker and
Stem 3 to form a closed ring. Remarkably, the linker connecting the 5′ end of the FSE to Stem 1

threads through this ring. This overall 3D arrangement was tested through a second cryo-EM
analysis of an FSE molecule extended by a rationally designed clothespin-shaped nanostructure at
Stem 3.
We note two caveats regarding our cryo-EM analysis. First, the 6.9 Å resolution of the
cryo-EM map is not sufficient to directly resolve base interactions, much less atom positions. It is
likely that hydrogen bonds and base pairs beyond our modeled secondary structure stabilize the
FSE 3D structure, and higher resolution structures will be needed to resolve those details. Second,
cryo-EM data processing can filter out alternative, less well-defined conformations while focusing
on particle images that contribute to the most well-defined structures. De novo computer modeling,
in addition to predicting the ring-threaded structure we observe, has suggested alternative
conformations in which the 5′ end is not threaded through the ring (Extended Data Figure 9).
Such alternative states of FSE may exist in our preparations but escape computational detection
due to the extra conformational heterogeneity at the 5′ ends. Within our nanostructure-tagged map
(Fig. 3b), alternative states may contribute to the lower resolution of the FSE segment compared
to the nanostructure segment.
Our cryo-EM-guided data and modeling, along with recent results from several groups,
suggest explanations for why FSE targeting efforts by us and others have so far yielded only
modest inhibition of frameshifting and viral replication4–6,34. There is accumulating evidence that,
in the full SARS-CoV-2 genome context, the FSE forms alternative structures involving genomic
segments upstream of the element (Extended Data Fig. 13 and refs27,44,45,50). As the human
ribosome approaches the FSE, it must unfold these upstream structures through its helicase
activity, and the FSE will refold. The position of the 5' end of the FSE will be influenced by
structures that existed prior to ribosome-induced refolding and could end up either threaded
through the final FSE Stem1-Stem2-Stem3 ring, as captured by our cryo-EM analysis , or remain
unthreaded (Fig. 4). The 5'-end threaded structure (Fig. 4a) appears poised to lead to ribosomal
pausing and -1 PRF through a torsional restraint mechanism21, perhaps working in concert with
specific interactions of the pseudoknot with the ribosome53. Other structures (Fig. 4b shows one
model) might be resolved by the ribosome without frameshifting. Further work, potentially
involving design of topologically trapped FSE variants, single molecule FRET, and time-resolved
cryo-EM of the ribosome54–57, will be necessary to test and refine this model.

The structural complexity of FSE 3D folding has implications for therapeutic targeting
efforts. First, for ASO targeting, the intricately threaded FSE tertiary structure (Fig. 4c) may hinder
strand invasion, even into regions typically considered unpaired, thus explaining the requirement
we and others have observed for near-micromolar ASO concentrations to achieve inhibition of
frameshifting. Second, for either ASO or small molecule inhibitors, if the molecule does not
significantly alter the partitioning in how the FSE 5'-end leads into the pseudoknot (Fig. 4a vs.
4b), it would not alter frameshifting efficiencies to extremely low levels, as is expected to be
needed to disrupt viral replication51. If this explanation is correct, design of anti-frameshifting
therapeutics may need to focus on binding to alternative structures that are distinct from our cryoEM-guided model. Alternatively, SARS-CoV-2 replication might be disrupted by maximizing
rather than inhibiting frameshifting, which would still perturb the stoichiometry of viral
proteins17,18. In this largely unexplored strategy, pro-frameshifting drugs could be designed to
stabilize binding pockets that consistently appear in all members of the cryo-EM-guided model
ensemble (Extended Data Figure 14). Three such sites, which we term the ‘ring site’, the ‘J3/2
site’, and the ‘slippery hairpin site’, involve nucleotides that are highly conserved across a diverse
range of coronaviruses (blue in Fig. 4c) and hence might be targeted with a reduced chance of viral
escape .
We have provided the first 3D structural data of a functionally obligate segment of the
SARS-CoV-2 genome and have described implications for mechanism and targeting of -1
programmed ribosomal frameshifting, an intricate and critical genomic process. Dozens of other
segments of the 30 kb RNA genome are highly conserved and have been predicted to be
structured27,44,45,50,58,59, many in the size range explored here. Applying antisense targeting and
cryo-EM to these segments may yield additional information that sheds light on poorly understood
SARS-CoV-2 RNA biology and, hopefully, accelerates design of genome-disrupting therapeutic
agents.
Materials and methods
Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA) design and preparation
LNAs are oligonucleotides with a 2′ sugar modification that locks the ribose in a C3′-endo
conformation by a 2′-O, 4′-C methylene bridge, which in turn locks the LNA into the A-form
helical conformation60. Oligonucleotides containing LNAs were custom synthesized by Integrated

Reverse transcription interference assays
To test binding of each LNA to the SARS-CoV-2 FSE, we initially planned to carry out SHAPE
and DMS chemical mapping but discovered in preliminary experiments that the bound S2D LNA
interfered with reverse transcription. We therefore used this interference itself to test for binding.
Binding assays were performed in 20 μL reactions containing either 1.2 pmol (0.06 μM RNA in
20 μL) or 0.2 pmol (0.01 μM in 20 μL). Starting in 4 μL of ddH2O, the RNA was incubated at
90°C for 3 mins, then cooled down to room temperature. Next, 4 μL of 5⨉ First strand buffer (1⨉
First strand buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2) was added and incubated
at 50°C for 30 mins, cooled down to room temperature prior to adding of 2.0 μL of either 0.0, 0.1,
1.0 and 10.0 μM of LNA, and further incubated at 37°C for 15 mins. Next, 5 μL of Oligo-dT-bead
mixture, containing 1.5 μL of Oligo dT beads (poly(A) purist, Ambion), 0.25 μL of 0.25 μM of

FAM-labelled Tail2 primer for 1.2 pmol RNA or 0.042 μM of FAM-labelled Tail2 primer for 0.2
pmol RNA, and 3.25 μl ddH2O, was added. Lastly, a premixed volume containing 1.0 μL of 100
mM DTT, 0.5 μL of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1.6 μL of 10
mM dNTPs and 1.9 μL of ddH2O was added to each reaction and reverse transcription was carried
out at 48°C for 40 mins. The resulting products were then treated equivalently to the standard 1D
SHAPE/DMS chemical mapping protocol (described below).

Reticulocyte Lysate kits (Promega), with translation mixes prepared in triplicate as per
manufacturer′s protocols (for S2D, all other LNAs are awaiting replicates), followed by incubating
at 30℃ for 1.5 h (for S2D, all other LNAs will be repeated with this incubation step, however
equivalent experiments with S2D without incubation showed no difference in signal). Luciferase

LNA treatment, caspase activation and cell viability assays
Cell-lines used for in cellulo experiments, Vero E6 and Huh-7, were maintained at 37°C in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Invitrogen), penicillin and streptomycin (Gibco), and HEPES buffer (Gibco).
For caspase activation and cell viability assays, one day prior to transfection, 10,000 cells per well
of Huh-7 or Vero E6 cells were plated in growth media in black-walled, clear bottom 96-well
plates (EK-25090, E&K Scientific) to be 50-70% confluent at time of transfection. 24 h later,
LNA-modified ASOs were diluted in Opti-MEM I and mixed with Lipofectamine 3000® reagent
(Life Technologies) according to manufacturer′s protocol to achieve final LNA concentrations of
1 μM, 0.1 μM, and 0.01 μM, in duplicate. The complexes were incubated at room-temperature for
30 mins, after which 10 μL of each of the LNA-Lipofectamine complex was added dropwise to
cells containing 90 μL of growth media. Cells were then incubated as described. A caspase-

activating LNA, Pos_LNA, and known apoptotic activator, camptothecin, were used as positive
controls.
To test caspase activation, 24 h post-transfection with the LNA ASOs, the Caspase-Glo 3/7 reagent
(G8092/G8093 kit; Promega, Madison WI, USA) was prepared at room-temperature according to
the manufacturer′s specifications. Once the cell plates were equilibrated at room temperature, a
1:1 ratio of Caspase-Glo 3/7 reagent volume to sample volume was added, its contents were mixed
gently at 350–500 rpm for 30 s using a plate shaker, and left to incubate at room temperature for
45 mins in the dark. The plates were measured for caspase activation by luminescence using a
Tecan Infinite® multimode plate reader (M1000, Tecan). Data were analyzed and graphed in
Prism 8 by GraphPad.
Cell viability after LNA ASO treatment was determined by PrestoBlue cell viability reagent
(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer′s instructions. LNA ASO transfections were generated
using the same transfection protocol described above in 96-well plates. After 4 days of incubation
with the LNA ASO transfection mix, 10 μl Prestoblue reagent (catalog no. 11644807; Roche
Applied Science) was added to each well and the plate was incubated for 1-2 h. The plate was then
read for fluorescence (540 nm excitation/590 nm emissions) using a Tecan Infinite® multimode
plate reader (M1000, Tecan). The cell viability after 4-days of LNA ASO treatment was calculated
as a percentage of total cellular viability, normalized to the average viability count of non-treated
wells in the absence of LNA ASOs after background correction. Data were analyzed and graphed
in Prism 8 by GraphPad.
Cellular SARS-CoV-2 replication assays
For cellular replication assays, LNA ASOs were reconstituted in RNase-free water at 100 μM
stock solutions, aliquoted and stored at -20oC prior to single-use. One day prior to transfection,
Huh-7 or Vero E6 cells were plated in 96-well clear bottom plates to be 50-60% confluency at the
time of treatment with LNAs S2D, S3D-1, S3D-2, or Scrambled LNA. Lipofectamine 3000® (Life
Technologies) was used to transfect LNA ASO’s into cells at 25 nM final concentration per
manufacturer′s protocol. Cells were then infected with SARS-CoV-2 reporter virus expressing
nanoluciferase (SARS-CoV-2 nLUC) at an MOI of 0.3 for 1 h after which the virus was removed

and fresh medium was added. Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nLUC is an authentic fully replicating
virus where ORF7 has been deleted and replaced with nLUC. Thus the measurement of nLUC
expression is a surrogate marker of virus replication enabling the screening of antiviral
compounds, obviating the need for costly and time-consuming virus titering assays63. A nucleoside
analog NHC (a.k.a. EIDD-1931) with potent activity against SARS-CoV-2 was included as a
positive control33. A DMSO control was included as a mock treated, negative control. Data was
graphed and analyzed in Prism 8 by GraphPad. Statistical analysis for data from each cell-type
was computed as an ordinary one-way ANOVA using Dunnet′s multiple comparisons test against
the DMSO control from each cell type.
Sample preparation for chemical mapping and cryo-electron microscopy
The SARS-CoV-2 FSE sequence was derived from the NCBI GenBank reference sequence
NC.045512.264 and corroborated using manual alignment against existing annotated
betacoronavirus FSEs3. For cryo-EM studies, the sequence was then prepended with the Φ2.5 T7
RNA polymerase promoter (to avoid the obligate 5′ GG coding requirement of the canonical Φ6.5
T7 RNAP promoter)65. Primers were designed for PCR assembly using the Primerize65,66 web
server, ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies, and assembled into full-length doublestranded DNA (dsDNA) by PCR assembly following the Primerize protocol using Phusion
polymerase, ′High-Fidelity′ buffer (Thermo Scientific™), and an annealing temperature of 64℃.
Product homogeneity was assessed by 1xTBE (Ambion) - 4% agarose gel electrophoresis as
visualized with ethidium bromide. The resulting product was purified using Qiagen QIAquick PCR
purification kits, eluted in molecular biology grade double-distilled H2O (ddH2O, Invitrogen™),
and quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific™). The resulting dsDNA
was then used for in vitro transcription (IVT) using a Thermo Scientific TranscriptAid T7 kit
(Thermo Scientific™) where 22 reactions were carried out at 1.19 μg dsDNA per reaction and left
at 37℃ for 12 hours. The resulting product was split equally over four Zymo25 RNA Clean and
Concentrator (Zymo Research) columns and cleaned following the manufacturer′s protocol with
an extra 15-minute drying step prior to elution in 30 μL of ddH2O per column; RNA was quantified
at 5-fold dilution via NanoDrop. Next, the RNA was purified by denaturing Poly-Acrylamide Gel
Electrophoresis (dPAGE), using 15% 29:1 Bis-Acrylamide, 7M urea, 1x TBE gels cast in BioRad
Criterion 1mm Midi Cassettes that were pre-run at 25 Watts for 1 h, before loading the 90℃

denatured RNA in 70% formamide, 1x TBE loading buffer with Bromophenol Blue and Xylene
Cyanol running markers and run at 25 Watts for another 45 mins. 50 μL of RNA was loaded per
gel, so two gels were used. The side wells of each gel were used for size standards and 2/35ths
diluted RNA for purification corroboration. To prevent potentially disrupting RNA structure with
intercalating dyes, the major RNA products on the dPAGE gels were localized and excised by
brief UV shadowing67. After the bulk RNA was excised, the remaining gel was stained for 20 mins
in SyBrGold (Invitrogen™) and visualized by UV transillumination. The excised gel pieces were
crushed and soaked overnight in 300 μL 10mM Tris, 1mM EDTA buffer (Ambion) per gel slice
on an active vortexer at 4℃. The resulting gel slurry was then spin filtered through 0.45 μm filters
(Corning® Costar®) and the filtrate was first purified in one Zymo25 RNA Clean and
Concentrator column per excised band, eluting in 40 μL ddH2O, and then through one Zymo5
RNA Clean and Concentrator column per sample, eluting in 25 μL ddH2O, at which point samples
were consolidated and concentrated one last time in one Zymo5 RNA Clean and Concentrator
column per sample, eluting in 14 μL ddH2O. RNA was quantified by NanoDrop. The same overall
protocol was carried out for the FSE and FSE-ATP-TTR3 chemical mapping constructs (see
below). Chemical mapping constructs were prepended with the canonical Φ6.5 T7 RNAP
promoter as the 5′ reference hairpins used had 5′ terminal GGs; additionally, these constructs were
gel extracted using blue-light transillumination after staining with SyBrGold. The FSE 1D
chemical mapping construct′s assembled dsDNA was 2% agarose gel purified by size using bluelight transillumination using SyBrSafe (Invitrogen™) and purified using a Qiagen MinElute Gel
Extraction kit prior to IVT.
Cryo-EM data acquisition
The RNA samples were folded prior to plunge freezing as previously described7. Briefly, the RNA
sample in a buffer containing 50 mM Na-HEPES (pH 8.0) was denatured at 90℃ for 3 mins and
cooled at room temperature (RT) for 10 mins; MgCl2 was then added to achieve a final
concentration of 15 μM RNA and 10 mM MgCl2, and samples were incubated at 50℃ for 20 mins,
followed by cooling at RT for 3 mins. Three microliters of the FSE and FSE-ATP-TTR3 samples
were applied onto glow-discharged 200-mesh R2/1 Quantifoil grids. The grids were blotted for 4
s and rapidly cryocooled in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at
4°C and 100% humidity. The final datasets in this study were imaged in a Titan Krios cryo-electron

microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 300 kV with GIF energy filter (Gatan) at a
magnification of 165,000× (corresponding to a calibrated sampling of 0.82 Å per pixel) for both
the samples. Micrographs were recorded by EPU software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a Gatan
K2 Summit direct electron detector, where each image was composed of 30 individual frames with
an exposure time of 6 s and an exposure rate of 8.3 electrons per second per Å2. A total of 10,222
movie stacks for FSE and 12,380 movie stacks for FSE-ATP-TTR3 were collected.
Single-particle image processing and 3D reconstruction
All micrographs were first imported into Relion for image processing. The motion-correction was
performed using MotionCor268 and the contrast transfer function (CTF) was determined using
CTFFIND469. All particles were autopicked using the NeuralNet option in EMAN2. Then, particle
coordinates were imported to Relion, where the poor 2D class averages were removed by several
rounds of 2D classification. The initial models for both datasets were built in cryoSPARC using
the ab-initio reconstruction option. For the FSE, 1,063,711 particles were picked and 445,707 were
selected after 2D classification in Relion. After removing classes with poorly connected density
by 3D classification, the final 3D refinement was performed using 109,137 particles in Relion, and
a 6.9-Å map was obtained. For the FSE-ATP-TTR3, 1,103,091 particles were picked and 902,309
were selected after 2D classification in Relion. After removing classes with poorly connected
density by 3D classification in Relion, two rounds of heterogeneous refinement performed in
cryoSPARC to further remove contaminant particles. The final 3D homogenous refinement was
performed using 257,558 particles, and a 6.4-Å map was obtained. Resolution for the final maps
was estimated with the 0.143 criterion of the Fourier shell correlation curve without or with mask.
A Gaussian low-pass filter was applied to the final 3D maps displayed in the UCSF Chimera
software package70.
One-dimensional chemical mapping
Chemical mapping was conducted on FSE, plusFSE and FSE-ATP-TTR3 constructs (Extended
Data Table 2) with reference hairpins added to either side of the regions of interest71. In brief,
dPAGE purified RNA was diluted to 80 nM in 50 mM Na-HEPES at pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2 folded
using the same folding scheme described for cryo-EM (plus an extra incubation at 37℃ for 24
mins at the end), followed by dilution to 60 nM in either 0.5% Dimethyl Sulfate (DMS) in 0.5%

ethanol in ddH2O, or 4.24 mg/mL 1-methyl-7-nitroisatoic anhydride (1M7) in Dimethyl Sulfoxide
(DMSO), reaction at room temperature for 15 mins, followed by quenching in 500mM NaMES at
pH6.5 for 1M7, and 51% β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) respectively. During this quench step, FAMlabelled Tail2 reverse transcription primer was added to a final concentration of 2 nM, with the
RNA at 40 nM. Reverse transcription was then carried out using SuperScript III (Invitrogen™)
alongside an RNA dideoxynucleotide (ddNTP) sequencing ladder. The resulting cDNA was
cleaned and then resuspended in HiDi-formamide (Applied Biosystems™) with ROX350 (Applied
Biosystems™) added as fiducial markers. Concentrated and dilute samples were then submitted
for capillary electrophoresis at Elim Biopharmaceuticals and the resulting FAM channel traces, as
aligned by the ROX350 markers, were used in HiTRACE71 to assign per-nucleotide reactivity data
for DMS, 1M7, and negative control incubation conditions. The resulting .rdat files were then
processed using RNAStructure with 100 bootstrapping rounds, allowing for the computation of
pseudoknots with the Biers software (https://github.com/ribokit/Biers).
Two-dimensional chemical mapping (M2-seq)
Following one-dimensional chemical mapping, the same constructs were also subjected to twodimensional (2D) chemical mapping which uses DMS modification on folded RNA but leverages
information on structural perturbations from sequence mutations to more directly infer helices72.
The resulting signals are read out using Illumina short read sequencing, exploiting the mutational
readthrough of DMS modified bases by the retrotranscriptase TGIRT-III (InGex).
In brief, the same DNA encoding the 1D chemical mapping constructs were first subjected to errorprone PCR (epPCR) where 2 ng/μL of PCR assembled (see above) dsDNA (1.6μg total dsDNA
used per construct, 8⨉ epPCRs) was amplified using the epPCR forward and reverse primers at
100 μM (Extended Data Table 2) under error-prone conditions: 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 50 mM
KCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dTTP, 1 mM dCTP, 200 nM dATP, 200 nM dGTP, 500 nM MnCl2, and
1x Taq polymerase (New England BioLabs inc.), using the following PCR cycling conditions:
initial denaturation at 98℃ for 60 s; then 35 cycles of 94℃ for 30 s, 60℃ for 60 s, and 72℃ for
180 s; followed by 72℃ for 10 mins. The resulting PCR products were concentrated using Qiagen
QIAquick PCR purification kits (1 per 200μL product). The resulting cleaned dsDNA was purified
by size on a SyBrSafe-stained 2% agarose gel using blue-light transillumination and purified using

a Qiagen MinElute Gel Extraction kit prior to IVT (4x TranscriptAid reactions, 2000ng dsDNA
per reaction, 12 h reaction at 37℃ followed by 20 mins DNase I treatment at 37℃, 1 μL per
reaction volume). The resulting RNA was Zymo25 purified, and then 8% dPAGE purified (see
above) by size using SyBrGold, blue-light transillumination, and one ZR small-RNA PAGE
Recovery kit per construct following the manufacturer′s protocol. The resulting size purified RNA
was then subjected to the M2-seq protocol. Briefly, unmodified (nomod) and DMS-modified
samples were prepared, using 5 pmol and 12.5 pmol of RNA per condition, respectively. RNA was
diluted into 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA buffer (Ambion) to 3.0 μL, denatured at 90℃ for 3 mins,
cooled to room temperature for 10 mins, and then diluted into 5.0 μL 1.5M sodium-cacodylate pH
7.0, 50 mM MgCl2 buffer and 14.5 μL ddH2O and allowed to refold at 50℃ for 20 mins followed
by cooling to room temperature for 3 mins. Following this folding, the buffered RNA was then
subjected to DMS chemical modification in 2.5 μL 15% DMS (diluted in 100% ethanol), or just
85% ethanol for the no modification condition, at 37℃ for 6 mins, followed by quenching with
25.0 μL β-mercaptoethanol. All of the DMS and β-mercaptoethanol steps were carried out in a
fume hood. The resulting quenched RNA reactions were then diluted in ddH2O to 100 μL and
ethanol precipitated using GlycoBlue (Invitrogen™) as a co-precipitant, resuspending the resulting
RNA in 7.0 μL ddH2O. Next, the cleaned nomod and DMS-modified RNA was reverse transcribed
using RTB FAM-labelled primers (Extended Data Table 2) using a unique index per condition,
per construct. 4.6 μL of RNA was incubated with 0.930 μL of 285 nM RTB primer in 6.520 μL
retrotranscription buffer: 2.4 μL 5x TGIRT-III buffer, 1.2 μL 10mM dNTPs mix (New England
BioLabs), 0.6 μL 100mM DDT (Invitrogen™), 1.32 μL ddH2O, and 1.0 μL TGIRT-III enzyme.
The reactions were allowed to sit at 25℃ for 5 mins, before being kept at 64℃ for 3 h. Afterwards,
the reactions were treated with 5.0 μL 400 mM NaOH at 90℃ for 3 mins, acid quenched (see
above) with 2.2 μL quench acid, and diluted in 30.75 μL ddH2O prior to purification using a Zymo
Oligo Clean and Concentrator kit, eluting in 12.5 μL ddH2O. The resulting cleaned cDNA were
then individually subjected to unidirectional PCR for second strand synthesis using the second
strand synthesis primer (Extended Data Table 2). 1.0 μL 100 μM primer was used per 2.5 μL
cDNA, and 19.5 μL PCR master mix (same as PCR assembly, see above). The reaction mixtures
were initially denatured at 98℃ for 60 s; then 4x cycles of 98℃ for 10 s, 58℃ for 30 s, and 72℃
for 30 s; followed by 72℃ for 10 mins. Immediately after the final step, PCR amplification using
the iTru p5 and p7 primers (Extended Data Table 2) was conducted in the same reaction mixtures.

2.0 μL of equimolar p5/p7 (50 μM per primer) mixture was spiked into each uni-directional PCR
reaction product, mixed, spun down, and quickly returned to the thermal cycler to conduct: initial
denaturation at 98℃ for 60 s; then 5x cycles of 98℃ for 10 s, 50℃ for 30 s, and 72℃ for 30 s;
followed by 15x cycles of 98℃ for 10 s, 60℃ for 30 s, increasing this temperature incrementally
each cycle to a final temperature of 70℃ by cycle 15, and 72℃ for 30 s; then 72℃ for 10 mins.
The resulting reaction products were then concentrated using Qiagen QIAquick PCR purification
kits, and finally 1% agarose gel purified by size using blue-light transillumination using SyBrSafe
and purified using Qiagen MinElute Gel Extraction kits. The resulting dsDNA sequencing libraries
were then sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq using the v3 600 cycle kit, loading equimolar
amounts of DMS treated DNA per construct, and 3 fold less nomod DNA per construct (14 fmol
dsDNA total including 40% PhiX control).
M2-seq data analysis was performed using the pipeline at https://github.com/ribokit/M2seq.
FASTQ files were demultiplexed with NovoBarcode, and demultiplexed files were processed with
ShapeMapper to obtain mutation strings for each read in a binary format. The simple_to_rdat.py
script was used to generate 2D mutational profiles in RDAT files. These files were then analyzed
with Biers (https://ribokit.github.io/Biers/) to generate Z-scores, normalized 1D DMS profiles, and
secondary structure predictions using ShapeKnots with 100 bootstrapping iterations guided by
both Z-scores and 1D DMS profiles.
Reactivity-guided structure modeling for extended FSE
Secondary structure modeling was performed for FSE constructs including 110 upstream
nucleotides, guided by SHAPE reactivity data collected in this study along with various recently
published SHAPE and DMS reactivity datasets27,28,73. SHAPE reactivity data were collected for
the extended FSE constructs with 1M7 as described above; data were averaged across two
replicates. DMS reactivity data from27 were normalized by scaling the median of the top 5% of
reactive bases to 1.0 and winsorizing. Predictions reported here were made with ShapeKnots and
100 bootstrapping iterations if pseudoknots were predicted; otherwise, RNAStructure′s Fold
algorithm was used, again with 100 bootstrapping iterations. All secondary structures were
depicted using RiboDraw (https://github.com/ribokit/RiboDraw/).

FSE model building
The 6.9-Å cryo-EM FSE map was first subjected to segmentation using Segger48 to remove any
contours lower than 0. The resulting segmented map was then low-pass filtered to 20-Å by
autoDRRAFTER, and a map threshold of 0.05 was used to compute the autoDRRAFTER fitting
nodes. AutoDRRAFTER identifies graph end nodes in both the experimental cryo-EM map and
the secondary structure, and then seeks to match these end nodes together to initiate model
building. Since the FSE is expected to have only one stem-loop (one end node), the SARS-CoV-2
FSE Stem 321, Stem 3 was hence used by the software as the initial point for docking the secondary
structure into the cryo-EM map. AutoDRRAFTER identified two map end-nodes (Extended Data
Fig. 7j) into which this Stem 3 was automatically docked and both were used for two identical,
and converged runs using Stem 3 as the docked helix, using the literature secondary structure as a
constraint (see Extended Data Table 2). We noted that jobs explicitly initiated with Stem 3
docking into what was later determined to be the incorrect region of the density (using the FSEATP-TTR-3) produced results very similar to jobs initiated with the other, correct, node used as
the docking point (Extended Data Fig. 7k). After this set of modelling as well as the crossvalidation using FSE-ATP-TTR-3, subsequent autoDRRAFTER jobs were conducted only using
the correct node as the specified docking position for Stem 3. Ultimately, jobs run using the 1D
chemical mapping-derived secondary structure resulted in marginally (~0.8 Å lower estimated
accuracy) better correlated models compared to models generated with either the literature and
M2-seq secondary structures (Extended Data Fig. 7a-i) and so were used for subsequent analysis.
Regardless of the starting secondary structure, all autoDRRAFTER runs resulted in similar global
tertiary structures (Extended Data Fig. 7a-i). Modelling was attempted using the FSE-ATP-TTR3
map, using the previously computed ATP-TTR 3 model as the initial docking structure, but the
absence of significant density at the FSE portion of the map produced convergent results that only
confidently placed the Stem 3 helix (Fig. 3c). All jobs were run on the Stanford high performance
computing cluster, Sherlock 2.0, using the latest distribution of Rosetta and autoDRRAFTER.
FSE-ATP-TTR3 design
ATP-TTR-3, a stabilized aptamer for ATP and AMP, was selected as a tag due to its stability,
structural features conducive to projection angle identification, and its helical end for linkage. The
tag was linked to the FSE by removing the dimerization loop (44-52) and placing the tag in its

place. Nucleotides were inserted in the FSE-tag junction (C44G and U52A, FSE numbering) to
remove any predicted secondary structure interactions between the FSE and tag and retain the
individual secondary structure prediction for FSE and the ATP-TTR 3 tag. Secondary structure
was predicted using CONTRAfold 2.074 using the following command:

contrafold predict

seq.fasta .
FSE-ATP-TTR3 Density Fitting
The previously obtained density of ATP-TTR 3 and the FSE density were fit into the density
obtained for the FSE-ATP-TTR3 construct using Situs

49

. The overlap was not expected to be

ideal because the FSE-ATP-TTR3 construct does not contain the dimerization loop of the FSE (nts
44-52) and has extra bases, C44 and U175, inserted at the fusion interface between the FSE and
ATP-TTR 3, a linkage not present in either individual construct. First, the ATP-TTR 3 density
was fit into the FSE-ATP-TTR3 density using the commands:
vol2pdb ATP-TTR_apo_ribosolve.mrc atp.pdb
colores FSE-ATP-TTR3.mrc atp.pdb -res 4
Next, the docking result with the highest correlation was subtracted from the FSE-ATP-TTR3
density.
pdb2vol atp_best_001.pdb atp_best_001.mrc #using 1A voxel spacing
voldiff FSE-ATP-TTR3.mrc atp_best_001.mrc diff.mrc
Finally, the FSE density was fit into the difference density.
vol2pdb FSE-wt.mrc fse.pdb
colores diff.mrc fse.pdb -res 7
pdb2vol col_best_001.pdb fse_001.mrc #same for all 9 hits, using 1A voxel spacing
The results were visualized in Chimera. The stem attached to the ATP-TTR 3 on the docking
result with the highest correlation was assigned to stem 3.

De novo RNA 3D structure modeling
De novo models were generated for frameshift stimulation elements from seven betacoronaviruses
with Rosetta′s rna_denovo application using the standard FARFAR2 protocol75. Secondary
structures for the frameshift stimulation elements for murine hepatitis virus (MHV), human
coronavirus HKU1, human coronavirus OC43, bovine coronavirus (BCoV), Middle Eastern
respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS), and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) were
obtained from prior literature analyses21. For MERS, 2,000 decoys were produced using the
FARFAR2 ROSIE server. De novo models for the SARS-CoV-2 FSE models were obtained as
described previously44. For all other cases, 150,000 decoys were generated using the Stanford high
performance computing cluster, Sherlock 2.0, and the Open Science Grid76. In each case, the 400
top-scoring models were clustered using the rna_cluster Rosetta application with a 5-Å cluster
radius. From the top 10 clusters, top-scoring cluster members demonstrating the threaded and
unthreaded

topologies

were

selected.

phyloP analysis
phyloP scores were extracted directly from the UCSC SARS-CoV-2 genome browser22 for both

Fig. 4. Structural complexity in SARS-CoV-2 -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting. After
the ribosome unfolds upstream genomic structures, the FSE refolds, resulting in a 3D fold in which
the 5´-end is either (a) threaded through a ring in the FSE pseudoknot (inset, hole indicated in
yellow), as captured in our cryo-EM structure, or (b) left unthreaded. The model in (b) reflects an
alternative fold with the same pseudoknotted secondary structure but distinct tertiary arrangement,
as captured by de novo modeling. The torsional restraint61 model suggests that the cryo-EMresolved conformation in (a) promotes pausing at the slippery site and ribosomal frameshifting
and should be targeted for destabilization relative to alternative folds (b) in antiviral efforts seeking
to disrupt frameshifting, or stabilization in efforts that seek to increase frameshifting. c. Three
potential small molecule binding sites suggested by the cryo-EM-resolved structure involve
nucleotides that are highly conserved relative to the rest of the genome. Model coloring is by the
phyloP score derived from 119 diverse coronaviruses22,77, with blue vs. red showing higher vs
lower conservation, respectively, compared to the mean phyloP score of the entire SARS-CoV-2
genome.

of the FSE map was determined by conducting an exhaustive search of the FSE-alone map into
the FSE-ATP-TTR3 map (with the ATP-TTR 3 part removed). The Fit to Segments option in the
Segger plugin of Chimera was used. a. Fits with the top-ten cross-correlation (CC) scores are
shown. The plot shows the top fit is significantly above the average of the other fits (Z-score =
2.6), indicating good confidence in the top fit as a correct placement. All 10 top fits are shown on
the right. b. The exhaustive search was done using Situs, fitting the model of the FSE into the
difference map between the FSE-ATP-TTR3 map and the ATP-TTR 3 map since Situs can only
take a model as input to be fitted. The FSE-only map was then fitted into the same position as the
model, and the fits of this map are visualized in red/gray boxes. The red box is for the top fit with
the highest CC score, and this fit is identical to the top fit identified as shown in (a). The other gray
boxes show fits of the model that have lower CC scores, which are plotted on the central bar.
