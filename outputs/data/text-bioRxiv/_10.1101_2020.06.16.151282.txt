Running title: Advantageous mutations of SARS-CoV-2

Key words: COVID-19, big data, PCR primer, therapeutic oligonucleotide, zoonotic virus

Abstract
We first conducted time-series analysis of mono- and dinucleotide composition for over
10,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes, as well as over 1500 Zaire ebolavirus genomes, and
found clear time-series changes in the compositions on a monthly basis, which should
reflect viral adaptations for efficient growth in human cells. We next developed a
sequence alignment free method that extensively searches for advantageous mutations
and rank them in an increase level for their intrapopulation frequency. Time-series
analysis of occurrences of oligonucleotides of diverse lengths for SARS-CoV-2
genomes revealed seven distinctive mutations that rapidly expanded their
intrapopulation frequency and are thought to be candidates of advantageous mutations
for the efficient growth in human cells.

1. Introduction

To confront the global threat of COVID-19 (World Health Organization, 2020), many
SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been rapidly decoded and promptly released
from the GISAI database (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017; Shu and McCauley, 2017).
To elucidate characteristics of this virus in various aspects, we must introduce various
research methods other than the phylogenetic tree construction, such as those used in
big data analyses. Many host factors (e.g., nucleotide pools, proteins and RNAs) are
involved in viral growth, and human cells may not present an ideal growth condition for
invading viruses from nonhuman hosts. Therefore, efficient growth after the invasion
will likely require changes in the virus genome. To study this viral adaptation, we
previously analyzed time-series changes in mono- and oligonucleotide compositions of
three zoonotic RNA viruses (Zaire ebolavirus, MERS coronavirus and influenza virus)
and identified time-series directional changes that were detectable even on a monthly
basis (Iwasaki et al., 2011, 2013; Wada et al., 2016). Additionally, an analysis of 25,000
influenza virus genomes showed that the directional changes were very similar between
H1N1 (starting in 1918), H3N2 (starting in 1968) and H1N1/2009 (starting in 2009)
(Wada et al., 2016). These reproducible changes of the three independent invasions
should reflect viral adaptive processes for efficient growth in human cells.

2. Materials and methods
Genome sequences of human SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded from the GISAI database
(https://www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/next-hcov-19-app/) (Elbe and
Buckland-Merrett, 2017; Shu and McCauley, 2017); sequences belonging to the
complete genome, high-coverage and human categories were downloaded on May 2,
2020. The polyA-tail sequence was removed before k-mer analyses. The Genome
sequences of Zaire ebolavirus were downloaded from the Virus Variation Resource
database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/variation/) (Hatcher et al.,
2017) on May 3, 2020.
In the study of RNA viruses, k-mers are subsequences of length k contained within the
RNA virus genome. For an example of a very short sequence, the RNA sequence
AGAUU has five monomers (A, G, A and 2Us), four 2-mers (AG, GA, AU and UU),
three 3-mers (AGA, GAU and AUU), two 4-mers (AGAU and GAUU) and one 5-mer
(AGAUU). For the k-mer counting of long genome sequences, KMC

files. Histogram analysis was done using the Excel function.

3. Results
3.1. Time-series changes in mononucleotide composition
To investigate whether time-series changes, which were previously found for Zaire
ebolavirus, MERS coronavirus and influenza virus (Wada et al., 2016), occur also in
SARS-CoV-2 isolated from humans, we plotted the mononucleotide composition (%) of
each strain of SARS-CoV-2 in an order corresponding the isolation date, after the
removal of the polyA-tail in advance (Fig. 1a). We first noticed the presence of the data
that appear to be outliers and found that these were often derived from the sequences
where the number of Ns (unknown nucleotides) is greater than 1000; this should be an
unavoidable situation in the case of urgent sequencing, such as SARS-CoV-2. Even in
the presence of the outliers, we have observed a time-series decrease in C% and an
increase in U%, although slight.

Fig. 1. Time-series changes in the mononucleotide composition. (a) Mononucleotide composition (%)
for each strain is plotted according to the days elapsed since 26/12/2019, the first day of SARS-CoV-2
isolation from human registered in the GISAI database. The regression line is indicated by a dashed line.
(b) The averaged mononucleotide compositions (%) of SARS-CoV-2 strains tabulated for each month are

plotted according to the elapsed months since December 2019; the 0 on the horizontal axis corresponds to
December 2019; the 2 corresponds to February 2020; the 4 corresponds to April 2020. (c) The level of
increase or decrease of each mononucleotide composition (%) of SARS-CoV-2 (Cov) from the start is
plotted for each month. The colored symbols used for each mononucleotide are common with those used
in b. (d) The increase or decrease level of each mononucleotide composition (%) of Zaire ebolavirus
(Ebo) from its epidemic start (March 2014) is plotted for each month. The symbol shape is the same as
SARS-CoV-2, but the color is changed to blue. (e) The increase or decrease level of each mononucleotide
composition (%) from the start for the two viruses is plotted for each month. The colored symbols are
common with those in c and d.

In the next analysis (Fig. 1b), rather than removing the noisy outliers, we tabulated the
virus strains for each month of collection and calculated the mononucleotide
composition (%) therein, as we previously done in the time series analysis of Zaire
ebolavirus (Wada et al., 2016). The monthly results clearly show a monotonic decrease
in A and C% and a monotonic increase in G and U%. This representation, however,
does not directly compare a level of the change between mononucleotides. Using
December 2019 as the starting point for the current pandemic (0 in both the horizontal
and vertical axes), the level of increase or decrease of each mononucleotide composition
(%) from the start is plotted for each month (Fig. 1c); the significant increase in G and
U% and the decrease in A and C% can be visualized in a single figure.
Next, we compared the change observed for SARS-CoV-2 with that for Zaire ebolavirus,
which started the epidemic in West Africa in March 2014. Although the number of
ebolavirus sequences is much smaller than SARS-CoV-2, there are 15 months in which
more than 10 strains per month have been reported, allowing us to see how long
directional increases and decreases will be sustained. Using March 2014 as the start (0
in both the horizontal and vertical axes), the level of increase or decrease of each
mononucleotide is plotted for each month (Fig. 1d). The previous study analyzed the
three regions (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone) separately and observed some regional
differences, but the present study did not distinguish the three regions. Although there is
some variation in data points that may be due to the regional difference and the small
number of sequences, each nucleotide clearly undergoes a directional change (Fig. 1d).
Fig. 1e shows both SARS-CoV-2 (reddish brown symbols) and ebolavirus (blue
symbols) on a single figure. Since the shape of the symbol is identical in both viruses, it
is clear that the direction of change in C% is reversed between the two viruses.

3.2. Time-series changes in dinucleotide composition
Next, we analyze the time series change in each dinucleotide composition (%) in the
monthly tabulated SARS-CoV-2 and ebolavirus genomes. The first and second panels
in Fig. 2a show the differences from the start month for 16 dinucleotides for
SARS-CoV-2 and ebolavirus, respectively. In both viruses, various dinucleotides are
clearly increased or decreased. Since the same symbol is used for the two viruses, it is
clear that the direction of increase or decrease of individual dinucleotides differs
between the two viruses. The last panel shows the data for both viruses, but here we
have selected the first and second highest dinucleotides for the increase or decrease
level in the last month of each virus. Although there are some differences between the
dinucleotides, the trend of increase and decrease appears to slightly slow down after
about six months from the ebolavirus epidemic start.

Fig. 2. Time-series changes in the dinucleotide composition (%). (a) The increase or decrease level of
each dinucleotide composition (%) from the start for the two viruses (Cov and Ebo) is plotted for each
month. The last panel shows the data for both viruses; here we selected the first and second highest
dinucleotides for the increase or decrease level in the last month of each virus; for ebolavirus, the symbols
are miniaturized in violet to distinguish the data of two viruses. (b) The increase or decrease level of each
month's Obs/Exp value for each dinucleotide is plotted for the two viruses. The last panel shows the data
for both viruses, as described in a.

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.16.151282; this version posted June 17, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

Since the mononucleotide composition changes time-dependently (Fig. 1), it is obvious
that the dinucleotide composition changes. However, there may exist some properties
that become apparent only when analyzing continuous nucleotides. By focusing on the
value (Obs/Exp) obtained by dividing the observed value of the dinucleotide (Obs) by
the expected value from the mononucleotide composition (Exp), the effect of the
mononucleotide change can be reduced. Fig. 2b shows the time-series difference in each
month's Obs/Exp value for each dinucleotide. In both viruses, there is a clear increase or
decrease in various dinucleotides, but the types of dinucleotides that increase or
decrease often differ from those observed in Fig. 2a and between the viruses. The last
panel shows the data for both viruses; here we have selected again the first and second
highest examples for the increase or decrease level. The time series pattern of Obs/Exp
for ebolavirus in Fig. 2b appears to be more complex than that in Fig. 2a. When it
comes to continuous nucleotides, the relationship to biological functions that include
various molecular mechanisms of the viral adaptation to human cells should become
more relevant than with mononucleotides, and this may be a reason for the complex
pattern in Fig. 2b.
3.3. Rapidly increasing 20-mers
Sequential extension of the oligonucleotide length from dinucleotide will provide clues
to elucidate the molecular adaptation mechanisms, but we next analyzed the occurrence
of 20-mers in SARS-CoV-2 genomes, as previously conducted for ebolavirus and
influenza virus (Wada et al., 2016, 2017). For these highly mutable viruses, the
time-series analysis of long oligonucleotides such as 20-mers is unambiguously
important for designing the PCR primers and therapeutic oligonucleotides that can be
used for a sufficiently long period (Wada et al., 2017). Since the polyA-tails were
removed in advance, none of the 20-mers was present more than once in each genome.
Therefore, it is important to mention that the occurrence level (%) of a certain 20-mer in
each month's viral population corresponded to the occurrence level (%) of the strains
with the 20-mer sequence in the viral population.
When we happened to search for 20-mers that were absent in all 16 strains isolated in
December 2019, then emerged and increased in occurrence, we unexpectedly found a
group of rapidly increasing 20-mers. This remarkable peculiarity is shown in Fig. 3a;
here, we focused on all 39,990 types of 20-mers that were present in April 2020 but

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.16.151282; this version posted June 17, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

absent in December 2019 and analyzed their occurrence level (%) in the April
population. The first histogram (reddish brown) displays the number of types of
20-mers present within each 3% width of the occurrence level in the April population.
In the area with a very low occurrence level, the vertical axis value is near 40,000,
which is almost the same to all 39,990 types emerged after December 2019; i.e., almost
all 20-mers that newly emerged exhibit a very low occurrence level in the April
population. However, when the vertical axis is displayed as a log (blue) scale, peculiar
data (marked with a long arrow) become evident at the position where the horizontal
value is more than 80% in the April population and the vertical log value is 1.903 (= 80).
To be more precise, sixty types of 20-mers have an occurrence level of 82%, and twenty
types have an occurrence level of 81%. When analyzing time-series changes in the
occurrence level of the eighty 20-mers, a very similar pattern of monotonic increase was
observed for all eighty 20-mers (Fig. 3b).

changes of rapidly increasing 20-mers. (a) The vertical axis of the histogram shows normal numbers
(reddish brown) or logarithms (blue); here, nonexistence in the logarithmic display is shown expediently
as 0. Long and short arrows indicate the data locating in the highest and next highest region of interest.
(b) Monthly occurrence of eighty 20-mers found in the highest region are plotted according to elapsed
months. Since there is little difference between the eighty 20-mers, the relationship between each 20-mer

and the symbol was omitted. (c) Monthly occurrence of 20-mers found in the second highest region
(marked by a short arrow) are plotted according to elapsed months. The first, second and third rank in the
last month correspond to 20-mers derived from Seq5, 6 and 7, respectively. While there is a slight
difference in the intrapopulation frequency of each rank, resulting in a slight bulge (noted as a micro
diversity in the text), the relationship between each 20-mer and the symbol is omitted as in b. (d) Monthly
occurrences of pre- and post-mutation sequences of Seq1-4 are plotted according to elapsed months,
respectively; green and reddish brown symbols are used for the pre- and post-mutation sequences with
suffixes B and A, respectively. (e) Monthly occurrences of pre- and post-mutation sequences of Seq5-7
are plotted as described in d.

3.4. Genomic positions of rapidly increasing 20-mers and their time-series occurrences
We next focus on the eighty 20-mers that have rapidly and monotonically increased
their intra-population frequency. Homology searches (BLASTn) against the viral
genome sequences showed that they can be grouped into four sets of twenty 20-mers
locating apart on the viral genome; the twenty 20-mers at each genomic location are
shifted by one base, resulting in a single 39-mer. Figure 4 presents sequences of four
39-mers found at the four genomic positions: Seq1 in 5’ UTR, Seq2 in Orf1a for nsp3,
Seq3 in Orf1b for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and Seq4 in S for surface
glycoprotein. Figure 4 presents also four pre-mutation sequences found in December
strains in the top row. Figure 3c shows the time-series changes in a total of eight
39-mers; the sequences before and after the mutation (symbols in green and reddish
brown, respectively) were distinguished by the additional letters B and A: e.g., Seq1B
and 1A. The 39-mers observed before or after mutation show a clear monotonic
decrease or increase, respectively; i.e., no bottleneck-type frequency reduction is

observed for the postmutation 39-mers.

Fig. 4. Sequences in focus and their genomic positions. The top row shows the premutation sequence found in
December 2019 strains, and the bottom row shows the postmutation sequence found in April strains; the nucleotide in
focus before or after the mutation is indicated in green or reddish brown. The nucleotide position was according to
the reference genome (isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, EPI_ISL_402125) (Changtai, et al., 2020). The sequences other than the
first sequence are from protein-coding genes, and the amino acid changes caused by the mutations are presented.
Seq8 noted in Discussion was not detected in Fig. 3, because a portion of December strains had the sequence; the
29-mer sequence obtained in the 15-mer analysis is UAUGAGAACCAAAAAUUGAUUGCCAACCA: the sequence
(24311-24339) in S encoding surface glycoprotein.

Looking at Fig. 3a, clearly distinctive data are also observed in the 32-24% range
(marked with a short arrow), and the BLASTn analysis gave the results presented in Fig.
4. The twenty 20-mers with an occurrence level of 32% belonged to a 39-mers located
in Orf3a (Seq5) and the twenty 20-mers with an occurrence level of 27% belonged to a
39-mers located in Orf1a for nsp2 (Seq6). In the case of the occurrence level of 24%,
twenty-two 20-mers belonging to a 41-mers located in N for nucleocapsid
phosphoprotein (Seq7). Interestingly, this mutation is not a point mutation, but three
bases are changed at once, and therefore, the number of 20-mers with the mutation in
focus increased from twenty to twenty two. Figure 3d shows the time-series changes in
four 39-mers and two 41-mers listed in Fig. 4; those found before or after mutation
show a clear monotonic decrease or increase, respectively.

Next, we re-examined the time series changes of the 20-mers (Fig. 3b and c) in more
detail. Even for the 20-mers belonging to the same 39- or 41-mer, there is a slight
difference in the occurrence level, which is observed as a slight bulge in the data at the
same location in Fig. 3c. This slight diversity was found to be caused by mutations that
occur around the interested mutations in a very small number of strains. Although the
possibility of sequencing errors cannot be ruled out, we think this slight diversity
reflects the random fluctuation caused by neutral mutations occurred around the
interested mutations.
3.5. Search for the hidden advantageous mutations
To understand molecular mechanisms of viral adaptation to human cells, it is
unambiguously important to find mutations that favor proliferation in human cells and
human-to-human transmission. Suzuki and Gojobori (1999) developed a method for
detecting positively selected sites in protein coding genes, by comparing the numbers of
synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions per site, and Suzuki (2006) applied it to
influenza virus genomes. We next explain that the present histogram and time-series
analysis, which does not rely on sequence alignment, is also a method for detecting
positively selected sites in RNA virus genomes.
The most important characteristic of the positively selected advantageous mutations
should be their rapid increase in the intra-population frequency. Seven mutations in
focus are candidates for the advantageous mutations, but advantageous mutations are
very rare compared to neutral mutations that are hitchhikingly synergistic to the
driver-type advantageous mutation. It is thus important to distinguish the genuine
advantageous mutation from the hitchhiker-type neutral mutations. To do so, we should
thoroughly search for candidates for advantageous mutations and rank them in an order
of the increase level of their intra-population frequency. If we can find such a mutation
that increases the intra-population frequency more rapidly than the interested mutations,
or at a similar level, the interested mutations in Fig. 4 may become the possible

hitchhiker-type neutral mutations synergistic to the newly found mutation.

Fig. 5. Histogram of occurrence levels of oligonucleotides shorter than 20-mer. The vertical axis of the
histogram shows logarithms (blue), and nonexistence in the logarithmic display is shown expediently as 0.
Long and short arrows indicate the data locating in the highest and next highest region of interest, as
described in Fig. 3a.

We first explain the characteristic of the present histogram analysis shown in Fig. 3a.
There, we exhaustively analyzed all 20-mer sequences that were absent in all December
(2019) strains but present in April (2020) strains. Therefore, the hidden advantageous
mutation “X” is missed only when such mutable sites that can counteract the X’s
intra-population expanse are present within 19 bases both upstream and downstream of
the X mutation. To search for the X mutation, we should analyze the sequences shorter
than 20-mer. Additionally, the restriction of non-existence in the December population
is removed, because the X mutation may exist in a few December strains.
For all 15-mers found in SARS-CoV-2 genomes, Fig. 5a shows the histogram for their
increase levels (%) in the April population from the December population. The pattern
is very similar to that listed in Fig. 3a, and importantly, all cases of more than 20%
increase are limited to the 107 (= 15x7 + 2) types of 15-mers with the seven mutations
in focus; the addition of 2 in parentheses is due to a three-nucleotide change found in
Seq7. It is worthy to note that ten out of the 59,922 type of 15-mers in April have two

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.16.151282; this version posted June 17, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

copies on the genome, but the two copies are also present in all December strains and
their occurrence levels very slightly decrease in April, which does not affect the search
for the X mutation. When it comes to 10-mers, more than 1200 out of a total of 47,002
types have multiple copies, but the 10-mers with the increase exceeding 20% are limited
to 72 (= 10x7 + 2) with the interested mutations.
In the case of 7-mer, approximately 60% of the 12,203 types present in April have
multiple copies and some have more than twenty copies, and therefore, the result is
expected to be complicated by the cumulative effect caused by many mutations
occurring around the interested mutations. However, all 7-mers with more than 20%
increase are limited to 51 (= 7x7 + 2) types with the interested mutations, showing the
extraordinarily rapid increase in their intra-population frequency. Even though, the
histogram pattern has changed significantly; the region of the high values (marked by a
long arrow) has begun to split, with the highest value reaching near 90%. It should be
noted that the top three were GGGUGUU, UUUUUAC and CUUUUUA (i.e., U- and/or
G-rich sequences), whose increase is predicted from the mono- and dinucleotide
increase (Figs. 1 and 2). In other words, the effect of the mono- and dinucleotide
increase is also becoming apparent.
Most 5-mers are present in more than one hundred copies on the genome, and a few
have ten thousand copies. Despite this, the top 20 (= 5x4) have the mutations in Seq1-4.
However, the distribution in the histogram is continuous in the region below 40%, and
the 5-mers with and without the mutations in Seq5-7 were mixed.

4. Discussion
4.1. Oligonucleotides shorter than 5-mer
When shortening the oligonucleotide length to 4-mer, there appeared two cases with
over 200% increase, and this was because the highest UUUU has the mutation in both
Seq1 and 2 and the second highest UUAC has the mutation in both Seq2 and 3 (Fig. 4).
In addition, UGUU with no mutation in Seq1-4 appeared in the sixth position; UGUU is
the most abundant 4-mer in April, with an average of over 300 copies per genome, and
its increase is predictable from the mono- and dinucleotide increase. Even when
shortening the oligonucleotide length to 3-mer, the top five had the Seq1-4 mutations.

We thus concluded that there is no hidden advantageous mutation that expands its
intra-population frequency at a faster rate than the Seq1-4 mutations, during the current
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to April 2020.
Next, we discuss the mutations in Seq5-7. When shortening the length to 4-mer, some
4-mers increased at the same level as those for the Seq5-7 mutations, and interestingly,
such cases that were not expectable from the mono- and dinucleotide increase were
observed in a high order: e.g., AAAU and AAUU. Interestingly, these corresponded to
the 4-mers that constitute the 15-mers, whose increase level was in the eighth position
(12% increase in Fig. 5); for detail of the Seq8, see the legend to Fig. 4. We thus
concluded that there is no hidden advantageous mutation that expands its
intra-population frequency at a faster rate than the mutations in Seq5-7.
4.2. Characteristic of sequences determined by the PCR method and order of appearance of the
interested mutations

First, we should point out that the viral sequence determined by the PCR method is of
an average property of multiple viral copies isolated from one patient. Even if a neutral
mutation occurs in a certain viral genome, unless the copy number at the start of the
infection is relatively low and the neutral mutation occurs early in the infection, the
mutation is not reflected in the determined sequence of the patient because of the PCR
averaging operation.
Next, we explain the order of the mutations found in Seq1-7. The mutations in Seq1-4
appeared first in the following two January strains; the
hCoV-19/Germany/BavPat1/2020|EPI_ISL_406862|2020-01-28 carried mutations in
Seq1, 2 and 4, and the hCoV-19/Zhejiang/HZ103/2020|EPI_ISL_422425|2020-01-24
carried mutations in Seq2, 3 and 4; i.e., mutations in Seq2 and 4 were commonly
present in these two strains. However, the mutation in Seq5-7 had not yet emerged in
January. Among 493 strains in February, mutations in Seq1, 2, 3 and 4 were found in 65,
65, 62 and 67 strains. New mutations in Seq5, 6 and 7 were found in 10, 11 and 27
strains, and were almost always present in strains with the Seq4 mutation; i.e., Seq5, 6
and 7 mutations occurred in a strain with the Seq4 mutation. Although the majority of
Seq5 and 6 mutations were observed in common strains, the Seq7 mutation was
exclusive to the former two; i.e., the mutation occurred independently from those of
Seq5 and 6.

A more detailed discussion will require epidemiological information, but from the
results of the time series analysis alone, we can conclude that the Seq4 mutation is the
genuine advantageous mutation, most significantly increasing the intrapopulation
frequency from January to April. The Seq7 mutation is also considered to be an
advantageous mutation, because this mutation appeared after the strain with the Seq4
mutation has reached a significant number. While the possibility that either Seq5 or 6 is
a neutral mutation cannot be ruled out, both are considered to be advantageous
mutations because the mutations are nonsynonymous between amino acids with
different chemical properties.
4.3. A sequence alignment-free method for searching advantageous mutations
As explained in Introduction, a wide variety of technologies must be introduced to
combat emerging infectious diseases, such as COVD-19. The present study has
attempted to develop a sequence alignment free method that will become a complement
to the phylogenetic tree construction in viral evolutionary studies. We focused on the
technological development, rather than discussing biological implications of the
obtained results. Time-series analysis of occurrences of oligonucleotides of diverse
lengths can unveil various characteristics hidden in the virus genome. Furthermore, the
present method can extensively search for advantageous mutations (i.e., unveil the
hidden ones) and rank them in an increase level for their intra-population frequency. All
methods used here are suitable for big data analysis. In addition, although there are a
significant number of viral sequences that contained many Ns, the present analysis does
not require any special preprocessing. As a characteristic of big data analysis, the effects
of erroneous data naturally decrease with the increase in the data size. The present
method should become a powerful complement to the phylogenetic tree method in the
viral evolutionary study. Combining it with an unsupervised-type AI (Iwasaki et al.,
2011, 2013) can provide a powerful method for obtaining novel knowledge from big
data of viral genome sequences.
