Abstract
A safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is essential to avert the on-going COVID19 pandemic. Here, we developed a subunit vaccine, which is comprised of CHOexpressed spike ectodomain protein (StriFK) and nitrogen bisphosphonates-modified zincaluminum hybrid adjuvant (FH002C). This vaccine candidate rapidly elicited the robust
humoral response, Th1/Th2 balanced helper CD4 T cell and CD8 T cell immune response
in animal models. In mice, hamsters, and non-human primates, 2-shot and 3-shot
immunization of StriFK-FH002C generated 28- to 38-fold and 47- to 269-fold higher
neutralizing antibody titers than the human COVID-19 convalescent plasmas, respectively.
More importantly, the StriFK-FH002C immunization conferred sterilizing immunity to
prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, which also protected animals from virusinduced weight loss, COVID-19-like symptoms, and pneumonia in hamsters. Vaccineinduced neutralizing and cell-based receptor-blocking antibody titers correlated well with
protective efficacy in hamsters, suggesting vaccine-elicited protection is immuneassociated. The StriFK-FH002C provided a promising SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate for
further clinical evaluation.

Introduction
The first coronavirus pandemic in human history, caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is changing the whole landscape of global public
health. To date, 218 countries and regions around the world have confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infections, with over 60 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and costing nearly 1.5 million
people’s lives, and the number of human infections is still rocketing up. Even though many
efforts could slow down the virus transmission, it is generally believed that the ultimate tool
to avert such a pandemic should be an effective and safe vaccine, with which to achieve
herds immunity. Thus, the advent of one or more efficacious vaccines, having the
availability, accessibility, and affordability across the globe, is essential for achieving
effective control of the pandemic, which is still on-going even with new peaks of all-time
high of 2nd wave in the winter in certain countries/areas of the northern hemisphere.
The cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly mediated by the interaction of viral

spike protein and its major receptor, the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (13). Like other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 spike is a homotrimer protruding from the
viral surface, and it comprises two functional subunits, namely, the S1 subunit containing
the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the S2 subunit mediating membrane fusion
between the virus and the cell (4-6). To date, several lines of evidence showed that
antibodies against this spike protein could play a critical role in the immunoprophylaxis and
therapeutics against COVID-19 (7-12). A vast array of different platforms with different
molecular modality is currently being employed for vaccine development against COVID19 (13-19). Subunit vaccines, particularly in the case that protein making up the subunits
could be prepared using recombinant DNA technology, are of great advantage due to its
proven safety and compatibility with multiple boosts if necessary (20).
Two challenges, however, should be addressed to develop an ideal SARS-CoV-2
subunit vaccine. The first is to prepare the recombinant protein subunits in a functional
form that can predominantly elicit SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies rather than nonneutralizing antibodies, as the latter may mediate antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)
for disease or infection (21). The second is to overcome the less immunogenic drawback
of the subunit protein than an intact virus or virus-like particle-based vaccines (20). As the
classical Alum adjuvant is generally apt to stimulate Th2-biased immune response, its use
could be associated with vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) (22,
23). New adjuvants that can help to generate a more balanced Th1/Th2 cellular response
and to improve the immunogenicity of the non-particulate protein-based vaccine are
certainly required.
In this study, through in vivo evaluation of the immunogenicity of CHO-expressed
various spike derivatives, we identified the full length of the spike ectodomain (StriFK),
which induced more neutralizing to non-neutralizing antibodies, as the best performing
immunogen.

with Al001 for both the functional antibodies and cellular responses. More importantly, we
demonstrated the immunizations of StriFK-FH002C in hamsters provided adequate and
immune-correlated protection against the infection, pathogenesis, and inter-animal
transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Together, our results showed robust immune responses and
protective potency elicited by a new adjuvant formulated StriFK vaccine in animals.

Results
Comparisons of the antibody response induced by various vaccine candidates in
mice
Using the CHO expression system, recombinant spike protein derivatives of SARSCoV-2, including RBD, S1, S2, trimerized RBD (RBDTfd) and S-ectodomain (StriFK), were
obtained (Figure 1A). All five purified proteins achieved acceptable purity and reacted well
with antibodies in the COVID-19-convalescent human plasma in western blots (Figure 1B).
For adjuvant used in the immunogenicity evaluation in mice (Figure 1C), both the traditional
Alum (Al001) and the novel FH002C adjuvants showed similar morphology and antigen
adsorption capacity (Figure S1).
Among all tested candidates, the StriFK-FH002C immunized mice presented the most
rapid antibody response, showing detectable anti-spike, anti-RBD, and neutralization
antibodies (nAb) just 1-week after administration of the 1st dose (Figure 1C). Two weeks
after the 1st dose, mice receiving StriFK or S1 (with either adjuvant) all presented
detectable (geometric mean titer, GMT≥100) anti-spike antibodies, whereas mice received
RBDTfd-FH002C, StriFK-Al001, StriFK-FH002C, and S1-FH002C showed detectable antiRBD antibodies. However, at this time point, only mice immunized with StriFK-FH002C
presented pseudovirus neutralizing antibody (GMT=200). Compared to Al001, the new
FH002C adjuvant stimulated significantly higher and more rapid antibody response in mice,
regardless of the immunogen used. At Week 6, after 3-dose immunization was completed,
the RBD, RBDTfd, S1, and StriFK induced similarly high levels of anti-spike and anti-RBD
in combination with FH002C adjuvant.
As expected, anti-S2 antibodies were only observed at comparable levels in mice
immunized with StriFK and S2 (Figure 1D). Sera from S2-immunized mice showed

detectable nAb levels, suggesting that both S1- and S2-specific antibodies contribute to
the neutralization activities of StriFK-induced antibodies. Regression analyses on the
associations between the anti-spike binding titer and the neutralizing titer in mice receiving
various immunogens revealed that the StriFK had a higher neutralizing-to-binding ratio (as
reflected by a larger slope value) than the others (Figure 1E).
In a stable pool of CHO cells transfected with StriFK-expressing construct, protein
expression reached over 200 mg/L (Figure S2A). The molecular weight of the StriFK was
determined to be approximately 700-kDa by HPLC-SEC analysis (Figure S2B). The StriFK
showed a binding affinity of 3.52 nM to human ACE2 protein (Figure S2C) and exhibited
good reactivities to human COVID-19-convalescent plasmas in ELISA-binding assay
(Figure S2D). The StriFK-binding activities of human COVID-19-convalescent plasmas
positively correlated with their neutralizing titers against pseudotyped and authentic SARSCoV-2 virus, also well associated with their receptor-blocking titers (Figure S2E).
Together, the StriFK combined with the FH002C adjuvant provided an excellent
vaccine candidate for further evaluation.
StriFK-FH002C stimulated potent SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell response in mice
To test the vaccination effect in promoting the germinal center formation, we measured
the frequencies of T follicular helper (Tfh), germinal center B (GCB), and plasma cells in
lymph nodes (LNs) in mice (1 week after a single immunization). In comparison to StriFKAl001, the StriFK-FH002C significantly increased the frequencies of Tfh (Figure 2A), GCB
(Figure 2B), and plasma cells (Figure 2C), which were consistent with the more rapid
antibody response and earlier antibody affinity maturation (indicated by higher IgG avidity)
after StriFK-FH002C immunization (Figure S3A).
In mice receiving 2-dose immunizations of StriFK-FH002C and StriFK-Al001, we
further measured spike-specific T cell response. In contrast to non-immunized animals, the
IFNγ ELISPOT assays revealed the numbers of IFNγ-secreting cells after ex vivo antigenpeptides stimulation increased by 28.9-fold and 5.8-fold in the spleen, and 14.0-fold and
2.3-fold in lymph nodes (LNs), in mice immunized by StriFK-FH002C and StriFK-Al001,
respectively (Figure 2D and 2E). Compared to Al001, the FH002C adjuvant elicited
significantly higher frequencies of spike-specific IFNγ-secreting cells in either spleen

(p=0.0002) or LNs (p=0.0031).
Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) measurements of mouse splenocytes stimulated
by spike-peptides demonstrated that the StriFK-FH002C successfully induced Th1, Th2,
and CTL responses, which were evidenced by significantly higher frequencies of spikespecific T cells of IFN-γ+CD4+ (p=0.0087, Figure 2F), IL4+CD4+ (p=0.041, Figure 2G) and
IFN-γ+CD8+(p=0.0022, Figure 2H), respectively. The StriFK-Al001 also increased spikespecific IL4+CD4+ (p=0.015, Figure 2G) and IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells (p=0.037, Figure 2H) in
splenocytes, but it appeared less potent than StriFK-FH002C. In spike-peptide restimulated cells from LNs, although the increases of T helper cells (IFN-γ+CD4+ and
IL4+CD4+) were not pronounced (Figure 2I and 2J), markedly elevated IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells
were observed in both vaccinated groups (Figure 2K).
Consistent with T cell analysis findings, sera from StriFK-FH002C immunized animals
showed significantly higher IgG2a or 2b titers (Figure S3B) and IgG2-to-IgG1 titer ratio
(Figure S3C) than StriFK-Al001. Together, these results demonstrated the StriFK-FH002C
could induce a more balanced Th1/Th2 immune response.
Immunogenicity of StriFK-FH002C in non-human primates and hamsters
Next, we examined the immunogenicity of StriFK-FH002C in cynomolgus macaques
in comparison to StriFK-Al001 and RBD-FH002C (Figure S4). After the 2-dose regimen, at
Week 4 all vaccine-immunized monkeys showed detectable anti-spike (Figure S4A),
neutralizing (Figure S4B), and receptor-blocking antibodies (Figure S4C). In contrast to
RBD, the StriFK stimulated higher antibody titers in all three assays, particularly for the 1st
and 2nd dose. On the other hand, the FH002C adjuvant showed advantages in accelerating
antibody generation. After the 3-dose immunization completion, animals immunized with
all three vaccine candidates displayed similarly high levels of nAb and receptor-blocking
antibodies, suggesting the advantages of StriFK-FH002C were mainly reflected in the rapid
antibody response in the early immunization phase. However, the highest neutralizing
response (GMT=32,081, one was 26,721, and the other one was 38,515) was still
observed in monkeys received 3-dose of StriFK-FH002C immunization at Week 7. No
abnormality in body weight (Figure S4D), body temperature (Figure S4D), liver function
(Figure S4E), renal function (Figure S4F), cardiac enzymes (Figure S4G) or other clinical

manifestation was observed in StriFK-FH002C or StriFK-Al001 immunized animals,
suggesting a good safety profile of these vaccines in non-human primates.
As non-human primate was reported as a mild disease model for SARS-CoV-2
infection (24), while hamster is considered as a suitable animal model mimicking severe
COVID-19 pneumonia in humans (25-27), here we assessed the immunogenicity of
vaccine candidates in Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), aiming to evaluate
the protective efficacy using this model (Figure 3). Hamsters received StriFK-based
vaccines (either StriFK-FH002C or StriFK-Al001), quickly generated detectable antibodies
as early as Week 1 after 1st-shot in all four antibodies measured. At Week 3, 7 days after
the 2nd dose regimen, the StriFK-FH002C elicited the highest titers of anti-RBD
(GMT=462,178; range: 102,400-1,968,300), anti-spike (GMT=1,604,827; range: 409,60017,714,700), neutralizing antibody (GMT=16,617; range: 6,478-31,220), and receptorblocking antibody (GMT=634; range: 369-1,537). From Weeks 3 to 6, the antibody titers in
StriFK-FH002C or StriFK-Al001 immunized animals slightly decreased to about 50% of the
corresponding peak values. When a booster immunization was given at Week 6, the serum
antibodies of animals in groups of StriFK-FH002C and StriFK-Al001 rapidly increased to
comparable levels as that at Week 3. In hamsters, the StriFK-FH002C induced more than
4-fold higher neutralizing receptor-blocking antibody titers than StriFK-Al001, implying the
potent immunostimulatory effect of the FH002C adjuvant. Surprisingly, the RBD-FH002C,
which could generate binding and functional antibodies in mice and monkeys, showed very
little even no antibody response in hamsters.

Using the intranasal SARS-CoV-2 challenging method, we investigated the protective
efficacy of StriFK-FH002C in hamsters. We first tested whether a 2-shot immunization of
StriFK-FH002C could protect hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infection and its related
pneumonia. In this experiment, the neutralizing antibody GMT of the six StriFK-FH002C
vaccinated hamsters was 14,404 (range: 5,368-37,078). In the sham group that received
FH002C-only, hamsters lost an average of 8.4%, 12.2%, and 11.7% of body weight by 3,
5, and 7 days post-infection/inoculation of virus (dpi), respectively (Figure 4A). In contrast,

StriFK-FH002C immunized animals lost just an average of 2.0%, 2.1%, and 1.2% of body
weight by the corresponding time points (Figure 4A), which was significantly lower than
that of the sham controls (p<0.0001, two-side two-way ANOVA test) and similar to that of
the uninfected (mock) group (p=0.061). All animals in the sham group exhibited obvious
symptoms of weakness, piloerection, hunch back, or abdominal respiration, which was
observed in neither vaccinated nor un-infected animals (Figure 4B).
The 2-shot immunized animals in sham and vaccine groups were executed at 3, 5,
and 7 dpi (2 animals per time point) to assess the viral loads and histopathological profiles
in the respiratory tract. For sham controls, the peak viral loads in lung tissues were detected
at 3 dpi (6.4±0.3 log10 PFU/mL) and gradually decreased at 5 dpi (5.4±0.3 log10 PFU/mL)
and 7 dpi (2.5±0.3 log10 PFU/mL). In the StriFK-FH002C group, the infectious virus was
only detected in lung tissues of hamster FV002 (4.2 log10 PFU/mL) at 3 dpi, but not in
tissues of other animals (Figure 4C). The relatively lower neutralizing antibody titer in
FV002 (ID50=5,368) than the others (ID50 range: 9,363-37,078) was a possible explanation
for the insufficient protection of this animal individual. However, the lung viral titer of the
FV002 hamster remained markedly lower than those from sham controls. The
nucleocapsid immunostainings in the lungs were largely consistent with viral titer profiles
(Figure 4D). Pathological examination of the lung sections by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)
staining demonstrated typical features of moderate-to-severe interstitial pneumonia in
sham controls. In contrast, vaccinated animals only showed slight histological changes
with significantly reduced pathological severity (Figure 4E).
To further evaluate the protective efficacy of StriFK-FH002C and to reveal the role of
FH002C adjuvant, 3-shot immunizations of StriFK-FH002C or StriFK-Al001 (n=8 each)
were conducted in hamster for the SARS-CoV-2 challenging study (Figure 5A). The
neutralizing and receptor-blocking antibody titers in these StriFK-FH002C vaccinated
animals were approximately 4 folds higher than that in StriFK-Al001 vaccinated animals.
The average weight loss at 5 dpi was 9.0%, -0.04% and 0.17% in the unvaccinated controls,
the StriFK-FH002C and the StriFK-Al001 groups, respectively (Figure 5B). The weight loss
was markedly lower in both vaccinated groups compared to unvaccinated controls
(p<0.0001 for both comparisons) and showed no significant difference between the StriFK-

FH002C and StriFK-Al001 groups (p=0.39). Infectious viruses were detected in all
unvaccinated animals' lungs. Interestingly, the males showed higher viral titers than
females. In the lung tissues of vaccinated hamsters, no infectious virus was detected
(Figure 5C).
Consistent with infectious virus titers, viral RNA levels were profoundly reduced (over
4 logs) in lung tissues from vaccinated hamsters compared to the controls (Figure 5D). In
trachea and nasal turbinate tissues, StriFK-FH002C immunized hamsters exhibited more
marked viral RNA reductions (over 3 logs) than those received StriFK-Al001 (Figure 5E).
No significant gender difference was found for vaccination-mediated viral RNA reduction.
Gross lung pictures demonstrated multifocal diffuse hyperemia and consolidation in the
lungs of controls, and the apparent lesions were significantly diminished in both vaccinated
groups (Figure S5A). Histopathological examinations observed pulmonary consolidation,
alveolar destruction, and diffuse inflammation in about 20-30% of lungs from female
controls and 50-60% of lungs from male controls, suggesting male hamsters had more
severe pneumonia than females. Comparing to controls, vaccinated animals (using StriFKFH002C or StriFK-Al001), either males or females, only showed mild inflammation in
limited areas of lungs, and had minimal pneumonia pathology in most areas of lungs
(Figure 5F).
These results demonstrated StriFK-FH002C immunizations effectively prevented
hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and pathogenesis.
Protective efficacy of StriFK-FH002C against SARS-CoV-2 inter-animal transmission
in hamsters
To mimic the disease transmission, we also assessed whether the StriFK-FH002C
vaccine could protect inter-animal SARS-CoV-2 transmission in hamsters (Figure 6A). Cohoused with the infected donors, the unvaccinated control hamsters showed their maximal
weight loss on Day 4 (mean: 8.5%) post-contact exposure (Figure 6B). In contrast, the
weight loss was diminished in both vaccinated groups (StriFK-Al001 vs controls, p=0.0091;
StriFK-FH002C vs controls, p<0.0001), and it changed to a lesser degree (p=0.017) in the
StriFK-FH002C group (mean: -0.22%) than that in StriFK-Al001 group (mean: 3.6%). None
of the vaccinated animals presented infectious virus in their lungs at Day 5 post-exposure,

whereas all control animals had detectable infectious viruses at varying titers (Figure 6C).
More consistent with the weight change findings, viral RNA detections revealed a lower
viral load in hamsters of the StriFK-FH002C group than in StriFK-Al001 immunized animals
or unvaccinated controls (Figure 6D and 6E). Gross lung images (Figure S5B) and
pathological analyses (Figure 6F) indicated that control hamsters had extensive lung damage,
with consolidated lesion and inflammatory cell infiltration across larger areas, which was
quite similar to that presented in intranasal SARS-CoV-2 challenged hamsters. In contrast,

both vaccines prevented tissue damage to a large degree, if any, with mild perivascular
and alveolar infiltration observed in very few areas (Figure 6F).
Immune-correlation of protective efficacy of StriFK-FH002C vaccination
Using pooled animals related to Figures 5 and 6, we analyzed the associations
between the StriFK-elicited functional antibody titers and indices for protective efficacy. We
demonstrated that the serum titers (before the virus challenge) of neutralizing antibody and
receptor-blocking antibody were negatively correlated with viral levels in tissues of nasal
turbinate, trachea, and lung from virus-challenged hamsters (Figure S6). We also
compared the serum antibody titers of hamsters before and after the SARS-CoV-2
challenge (Figure 7A and 7B). Control hamsters showed an average of 24-fold (p<0.0001)
and 5.4-fold (p<0.0001) increase in neutralizing antibody and receptor-blocking antibody,
whereas the StriFK-Al001 immunized animals presented only 2.8-fold (p<0.0001) and 1.4fold (p=0.0066) elevation in corresponding antibody markers. Notably, the StriFK-FH002C
immunized hamsters showed no significant antibody increase after the SARS-CoV-2
challenge in either neutralizing antibody (p=0.19) or receptor-blocking antibody (p=0.98),
suggesting that sterilizing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may have been conferred due to
immunization in these animals. The pooled antibody data in mice, hamsters, and nonhuman primates showed that the neutralizing antibodies induced by StriFK-FH002C in
animals were about 28- to 269-fold higher than that of the human COVID-19 convalescent
plasmas (Figure 7C).

Discussion
In this study, we systematically evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy

of a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine candidate SFTK-FH002C in different
animal models. This vaccine candidate was composed of CHO-expressed SARS-CoV-2
spike ectodomain protein (StriFK) and a novel adjuvant (FH002C). Comparing to other
tested spike derivatives, including RBD, S1, and S2, our in vivo data demonstrated the
StriFK generated a higher neutralizing-to-binding ratio (Figure 1E), which implied it induced
more neutralizing antibodies than non-neutralizing antibodies. The FH002C is a
functionalized zinc-aluminum hybrid adjuvant with a significantly improved immuneenhancing effect. Immunization with StriFK-FH002C at low doses in mice, hamsters, and
monkeys rapidly generated anti-spike, neutralizing, and receptor-blocking antibodies since
one-dose administration. Compared to the GMT level of human COVID-19 convalescent
plasmas, 2-shot StriFK-FH002C immunization induced 28-38 folds higher neutralizing
antibody and 3-shot immunization generated 47-269 folds higher neutralizing antibody in
mice, hamsters, and non-human primates (Figure 7C).
In hamster, an animal model recapitulating severe human COVID-19 disease, StriFKFH002C vaccination provided protective immunity to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 infection,
pathogenesis, and transmission effectively (Figure 4, 5, and 6). The positive correlations
between serum functional antibody (neutralizing or receptor-blocking antibody) titers and
SARS-CoV-2 virus challenging protective efficacy (Figure S6) demonstrated immuneassociated protection of this vaccine. It has been reported that anamnestic responses
following virus challenge, which usually occurred in animals with inadequate neutralizing
antibody, was a surrogate to evaluate whether the vaccination provides sterilizing immunity
(17). In our hamster challenging studies, anamnestic responses in either neutralizing or
receptor-blocking antibodies were observed in StriFK-Al001 vaccinated- but not in StriFKFH002C vaccinated- animals (Figure 7A and 7B) following the SARS-CoV-2 challenge,
suggesting 3-shot immunizations of StriFK-FH002C should have afforded sterilizing
immunity in hamsters. Other evidence to support this was the undetectable infectious virus
and the extremely low viral RNA in the lungs of StriFK-FH002C vaccinated animals (Figure
5D and Figure 6D). Although the protective efficacy of StriFK-FH002C in non-human
primates was not tested in this study, it can be expected according to the comparable levels
of neutralizing and receptor-blocking antibodies induced by this vaccine in cynomolgus

Apart from the highly immunogenic StriFK protein, the novel FH002C adjuvant also
plays an essential role in generating high protective antibody and spike-specific T cell
response levels. Due to the multiple mechanisms for effective adjuvants, novel adjuvants
have focused on different complex formulation involving multiple components with different
functions to form various ‘adjuvant systems’ (28). In the FH002C, a drug for osteoporosis
nitrogen bisphosphonate (risedronate) was loaded on the composite Alum adjuvant by
harnessing the Alum's highly-phosphophilic nature. Zinc ion, one species available to the
cellular environments upon adjuvant dissolution, has an immunostimulatory effect and was
known to steer the immune response more towards the Th1 pathway (29, 30). Although
the precise role of nitrogen bisphosphonate was still unknown, previous studies suggested
these compounds could stimulate γδ T cells expansion and act as a dendritic cell modulator
due to the upstream accumulation of phosphoantigen isopentyl diphosphate as a result of
inhibition of farnesyl diphosphate synthetase (31-33). Notably, the FH002C adjuvant
showed more potent effects than Al001 to promote the developments of Tfh and GCB cells
and generated antibody-producing plasma cells in the early days after immunization
(Figure 2A, 2B, and 2C). Due to the rapid differentiation of these cell populations, FH002C
adjuvant-based StriFK vaccine generated a faster and stronger protective antibody
response, which elicited neutralizing antibodies as early as 1-week after the initial
immunization. This advantage enables the vaccine's potential application for emergency
vaccination of close contacts due to high-risk exposure, aiming to quickly control outbreaks
among close contacts and in the naïve population.
In addition to neutralizing antibodies, T cells are also believed to be essential to
vaccine effectiveness (34-36). The spike of SARS-CoV-2 has a subnanomolar affinity to its
ACE2 receptor, and the infections may occur at the respiratory epithelium of the upper
respiratory tract where the antibody concentration is low. Moreover, the functional antibody
may not completely block viruses from invading cells; virus-specific T cells may play a
remedial role in eradicating virus-infected cells or inhibiting viral replication and spread via
non-cytotoxic effects (37, 38). Our in vivo data showed the StriFK-FH002C immunization
could induce potent spike-specific IFNγ+CD8+ and IFNγ+CD4+ T cells, which would help

to establish protective immunity afforded by both arms of the immune response in
vaccinated individuals.
Safety is also a crucial concern for COVID-19 vaccine development. Previous studies
on RSV and measles vaccine suggested VAERD is linked to Th2-biased immune response
(39-41). A similar phenomenon was also noted in animal studies regarding SARS-CoV
vaccines (39). Therefore, an ideal COVID-19 vaccine is expected to elicit a balanced
Th1/Th2 immune response. Recombinant protein vaccines adjuvanted by traditional
aluminum adjuvants generally induce significantly enhanced Th2-biased immune
responses but insufficient Th1 responses, which was also observed in the performance of
our StriFK-Al001 vaccine in the mouse model, as indicated by the lower IgG2-to-IgG1 titer
ratio (Figure S3). The FH002C adjuvant is a novel tool to overcome this drawback.
Compared to traditional Alum adjuvant (Al001) used in our licensed HEV and HPV vaccines,
the new FH002C adjuvant potently elicited both virus-specific Th1 and Th2 response, as
evidenced by the simultaneously elevated IFNγ+CD4+ and IL4+CD4+ T cells (Figure 2F
and 2G) in splenocytes of immunized mice. The ICS and ELISPOT assays further
demonstrated the StriFK-FH002C could elicit a more robust spike-specific CTL response
than the StriFK-Al001 (Figure 2D, 2H, and 2K), which may result from the enhanced Th1
response. On the other hand, as the hamster is a quite susceptible model of SARS-CoV-2
infection and pathogenesis (25), all vaccinated hamsters showed significantly diminished
virus infection and disease severity without VAERD evidence in our study (Figure 4, 5, and
6). Although the FH002C has not been tested in humans, the risedronate (a distinct
component differs from those in Al001) was clinically used to treat osteoporosis over 20year (42). Each dose introduces a fraction (<1/10) of what one would take in an oral dose
(e.g., 5 mg) (42). In the study, we did not find any systemic side effects in mice, hamsters,
or no-human primates (with 2.5 to 3.0 kg macaque receiving a full human dose) immunized
with the FH002C adjuvanted vaccine. These results suggested a good safety profile of
StriFK-FH002C in animals and supported further clinical trials in humans.
To date, there were over 180 vaccine candidates based on various platforms are under
developing against SARS-CoV-2 (19). The StriFK-FH002C differs from other reported
subunit vaccine candidates in two aspects: the unique FH002C adjuvant and the non-2P

mutated StriFK immunogen. FH002C does not rely on natural products (such as squalene,
QS-21, etc.). Instead, it utilizes readily available active pharmaceutical ingredients, making
it more scalable and more sustainable during the outbreaks and long-term use. On the
antigen front, most reported spike-protein-based vaccines were 2P-mutated, but the S-2P
production in mammalian cells is difficult with a low expression level (<10 mg/L) in transient
transfection according to previous studies (2, 43). In our hand, the StriFK expression could
reach a level of 40-60 mg/L in transiently transfected CHO cells, whereas the StriFK stablytransfected cell pools expressed the protein as high as >200 mg/L. Cloned high-production
cell line showed a yield over 500 mg/L. More importantly, our data demonstrated its
promising immunogenicity and protection in animals. The high yield and facile production
of StriFK may enable manufacturing robustness and scalability for further applications.
Using the CHO expression platform and the novel adjuvant FH002C, various spike proteins
from different disease-causing coronavirus strains could be expressed (and kept at the
high producing cell pool stage, like ‘cassettes-on-the-shelf’) ahead of time, enabling facile
antigen preparation and vaccine formulation toward rapid vaccine development against
emerging strains in the future. It is conceivable that this could be an effective approach for
controlling the virus spread with rapid development and deployment of an effective vaccine.
In summary, we developed a novel SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine based on
recombinant StriFK protein and an innovative functionalized adjuvant with unique
immunostimulatory properties. Our evaluations demonstrated the StriFK-FH002C was well
tolerated and exhibited good immunogenicity in mice, hamsters, and non-human primates.
Vaccinations with the StriFK-FH002C provided effective and immune-correlated
protectivity against the infection, pathogenesis, and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in
hamsters. Stopping transmission seems to be achievable based on the animal model here.
This vaccine candidate is under development in the pre-clinical stage and could be
manufactured on a large scale, with the hope that a stronger and more sustainable immune
response could be elicited using this vaccine than the natural infection.
Materials and Methods
Constructs for recombinant protein expression
The codon-optimized RBD cDNA of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank: MN908947.3) was

obtained by primer annealing. RBDTfd gene was produced by fusing with a trimeric foldon
of the T4 phage head fibritin at C-terminal. SARS-CoV-2 S1 and S2 subunit gene referring
to the full-length spike glycoprotein gene of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank: MN908947.3) were
synthesized by General Biosystems Co. Ltd (Anhui, China). Spike glycoprotein ectodomain
was introduced with three amino acid mutations in furin-like cleavage site that mutating
RRAR to GSAS, and fused with a trimeric foldon at C-terminal. All cDNA above were
introduced with a C-terminal polyhistidine sequence and codon-optimization was
performed for mammalian cell expression. These target genes were constructed into a
modified PiggyBac (PB) transposon vector EIRBsMie using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly
Master Mix (New England Biolabs, E2621L) described previously (44).
Protein expression and purification
For initial immunogenicity evaluation in mice, the recombinant proteins of RBD,
RBDTfd, S1, S2, and StriFK were transiently expressed by ExpiCHO-S cells. The plasmid
expression plasmid carrying each SARS-CoV-2-associated protein was transiently
transfected into ExpiCHO-S cells by using the ExpiFectamine™ CHO transfection kit
according to the manufacturer's instruction (Thermo Scientific, A29129). After transfection,
the cells were placed in an incubator shaker (Kühner AG, SMX1503C) at 37°C containing
8% CO2 for 24 hours, and then, transferred the cells to a shaker at 32°C containing 5%
CO2 culture for 5-7 days. Subsequently, the culture supernatants of CHO cells were
subjected to purification by Ni Sepharose Excel column (Cytiva). For further animal
vaccination studies, polyhistidine-free StriFK proteins were produced by a stable cell pool
transfected with StriFK-expressing construct. The proteins were purified from culture
supernatants by ion-exchange chromatography.
SDS-PAGE, western blot and HPLC-SEC
Purified proteins were submitted to SDS-PAGE using SurePAGE (Genscript).
Coomassie brilliant blue staining for SDS-PAGE were performed using eStain L1 Protein
Staining machine (Genscript). Gels for western blot were transferred onto the nitrocellulose
membrane and reacted with COVID-19-convalescent serum (1:500 diluted), followed by
washing and reaction with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-human pAb. The
blots were imaged on FUSION FX7 Spectra multispectral imaging system (VILBER). The

size exclusion liquid chromatography (SEC) for purified StriFK protein was performed using
a high-performance liquid chromatography system (Waters Alliance HPLC) on a TSKgel
G3000PWXL column.
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis
The binding affinity of StriFK to recombinant human ACE2 protein was determined by
SPR analysis. For the detection, rACE2 (mouse Fc tagged, Sino Biological) proteins were
immobilized to a protein G sensorchip (Cytiva) at a level of about 500 response units (RUs)
using Biacore 8000 (Cytiva). Serial dilutions of purified StriFK proteins were injected,
ranging in concentration from 200 to 0.78 nM. The RU data were fit to a 1:1 binding model
using BiacoreTM Insight evaluation software.
Plasmas of convalescent COVID-19 patients
Twelve plasma samples (including 11 convalescent COVID-19 plasmas and one
control sample) were used to test their activities to recombinant StriFK protein. The
authentic virus neutralizing titers, pseudovirus neutralizing titers, and receptor-blocking
titers had been measured and described in our previous study (44). Another 268 plasmas
collected from recovered COVID-19 patients within eight weeks since illness onset were
used to determine the GMT level of neutralizing antibodies (by pseudovirus virus assay) of
convalescent COVID-19 patients. All of these convalescent plasmas were collected after
the confirmed COVID-19 patients discharged from the First Hospital of Xiamen University.
The study was approved by the institutional review board of the School of Public Health in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and written informed consent was obtained.
Adjuvant characterization
The appearance of FH002C and Al001 was photographed. The morphological
characteristics of the two adjuvants were imaged at × 100 using the Motic AE31E inverted
microscope (Motic, Xiamen, China), and were observed at a nominal ×120,000
magnification by transmission electron microscopy (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). The particles'
size and zeta potentials were measured by using LS 13320 Beckman Coulter Laser
Particle Analyzer (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA) and NanoBrook Omni zeta potential
analyzer (Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, NY, USA), respectively.

hydroxyphosphate, much like what was described for adjuvants for HBV, HPV and HEV
vaccines (45-47), with a molar ratio of P/Al:0.15. The Al content in the formulation is 0.84
mg/mL. The FH002C is a novel functionalized adjuvant, wherein the Al element was
partially replaced with zinc, and the amorphous phosphophilic particles (48) were loaded
with risedronate for additional immunostimulatory activity. The resulting organic-inorganic
hybrid adjuvant showed similar whitish suspension morphology in aqueous solution with
the widely used A1001 adjuvant (45). Before using, the 2x adjuvants were mixed well with
resuspending, then each antigen sample (in 150 mM NaCl) was mixed at 2× concentration
with an equal volume of the adjuvant to achieve the final desired concentration of antigen
and adjuvant in the final formulation. The vaccine formulations were mixed well with several
gentle upside-and-downside turns of the vial/tube and stored at 2-8 °C until use. All the
vaccine formulations containing Al001 or FH002C were prepared at least 24 hours before
immunization. Based on the ELISA results using a sandwich assay with mAbs on both
sides, completeness of adsorption was shown to be at least 95% for both formulations
based on the antigen content in the supernatant as compared to the overall antigen in the
formulation.
Mouse immunization
For antibody response evaluation, BALB/c mice were maintained in a specific
pathogen-free (SPF) environment and immunized with various proteins at 1 μg/dose with
Al001 or FH002C through intramuscular injection, following an immunization schedule of
one priming dose at Week 0 plus two boosters at Weeks 2 and 4. Serum samples were
collected at Week 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 via retro-orbital bleeding to measure the antibody
titers.
For cellular immune response analyses, C57BL/6 mice were immunized 10 μg of
StriFK with Al001 or FH002C adjuvants via intramuscular injection on days 0 and 21. Then,
splenocytes and lymph node cells were collected on day 28 post-immunization for IFN-γ
enzyme-linked immunospot assays (ELISPOT) or intracellular cytokine staining (ICS)
measurements. To germinal center response characterization, the T follicular helper cells

(Tfh), germinal center B cells (GCB), and plasma cells in LNs from immunized C57BL/6
mice at 1-week after single immunization were analyzed by Flurescence Activated Cell
Sorting (FACS).
Enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT)
Briefly, single-cell suspensions from mouse spleen (106 cells per well) or LNs (4×105
cells per well) were seed in precoated ELISPOT plate (Dakewe Biotech). Subsequently,
cells were incubated with pooled peptides of SARS-CoV-2 spike (15-mer peptides with 11
amino acids overlap, cover the entire spike protein, Genscript) and cultured for 20 hours.
The detecting procedure was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Spots were counted and analyzed by using CTL-ImmunoSpot® S5 (Cellular Technology
Limited). The numbers of IFN-γ secreting cells were calculated by subtracting PBSstimulated wells from spike peptide pool-stimulated wells.
Flow cytometry analyses
For GCB cells and plasma cells analyses, lymph node cells were stained with
PerCP/cy5.5-conjugated anti-mouse TCRβ (Biolegend, 109228), APC/cy7-conjugated
anti-mouse B220 (Biolegend, 103224), PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD95 (BD, 554258),
Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-mouse GL-7 (Biolegend, 144606), BV421-conjugated
anti-mouse CD138 (Biolegend, 142523), FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgD (Biolegend,
405704) and LIVE/DEAD™ Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen). For Tfh cells
analysis, the following antibodies were used: rat anti-mouse CXCR5 (BD, 551961), biotinconjugated anti-rat IgG2a (Biolegend, 407504), APC conjugated streptavidin (eBioscience,
17-4317-82), FITC conjugated anti-mouse CD4 (Biolegend, 100406), PE/cy7 conjugated
anti-mouse CD8α (Biolegend, 100722), PerCP/cy5.5 conjugated anti-mouse TCRβ
(Biolegend, 109228), BV421 conjugated anti-mouse PD-1 (Biolegend, 135221) and
LIVE/DEAD™ Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit.
For ICS staining, mouse splenocytes (2×106 per test) and lymph node cells (2×106 per
test) were stimulated with pooled spike-peptides (1 μg/mL) in a U-bottom plate for an 18hour incubation in a CO2 incubator. Then, protein transport inhibitors (BD GolgiPlug™, BD
Biosciences) were added and incubated with cells for 6 hours. Subsequently, cells were
stained with PE/Cy7-conjugated anti-mouse CD4 (Biolegend, 100422), PerCP/cy5.5-

conjugated anti-mouse CD8α (Biolegend, 100734), FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD49b
(BD, 553857), and LIVE/DEAD™ Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit. Subsequently, cells
were fixed and permeated by using Fixation/Permeabilization Solution Kit (BD
Biosciences), and further stained with BV421-conjugated anti-mouse IL-4 (Biolegend,
504127) and, PE-conjugated anti-mouse IFN-γ (Biolegend, 505826). Finally, the samples
were measured by BD LSRFortessa X-20 Flow Cytometer (BD), and the data were
analyzed by FlowJo V10.6.0.
Anti-RBD, anti-spike, anti-S1, and anti-S2 IgG measurements
Microplates pre-coated with recombinant antigens of RBD, spike ectodomain, S1, or
S2, were provided by the Beijing Wantai company. For detections, serial-diluted (2-fold)
serum samples (100 μL per well) were added into the wells, and the plates were incubated
at 37 °C for 30 minutes, followed by washing with PBST buffer (20 mM PB7.4, 150 mM
NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20). Then, HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (for measurements of
mouse sera), anti-human IgG (for measurements of monkey sera), or anti-hamster IgG (for
measurements of hamster sera) solutions (100 μL per well) were added according to the
species of samples. After a further 30-min incubation followed by washing, TMB
chromogen solution (100 μL per well) was added into the well. Ten minutes later, the
chromogen reaction was stopped by adding 50 μL of 2 M H2SO4, and the OD450-630 was
measured. The IgG titer of each serum was defined as the dilution limit to achieve a positive
result (>median+3×SD of ODs of negative controls).
Measurements for antibody avidities and isotypes in mouse serum
Microplates pre-coated with recombinant spike protein were provided by the Beijing
Wantai company. Serial dilutions of serum samples from immunized mice were added into
the wells in duplicate microplates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1-hour and
followed by a PBST wash cycle (5 times). Then, one of the duplicate microplates was
incubated with 100 μL of 4M Urea solution and the other one was incubated with 100 μL of
PBS buffer at 37 °C for 20 min. Followed by a wash cycle, HRP-conjugated anti-mouse
IgG was added into the wells for incubation of 30 min at 37 °C. Finally, the plates were
further washed with PBST for 5 times and followed by chromogen reaction and OD
measurements. The binding activity of polyclonal antibodies in serum was defined as the

dilution fold required to achieve 50% of the maximal signal (ED50). The ratio of ED50(ureatreated) to ED50(PBS-control) was used to measure the avidity of serum polyclonal
antibodies to StriFK.
Serum IgG isotype-specific antibody titers were determined by a modified ELISA
method. For the assay, recombinant spike coated microplates were used. The serum
samples were serially diluted and reacted with plates following a similar procedure as
above mentioned in IgG titer measurements. After a 1-hour incubation, the plates were
washed for 5 times and subsequently incubated with HPR-conjugated goat anti-mouse
IgG1, IgG2a, or IgG2b (AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK ) at 37 °C for 30-minutes. Then, the plates
were washed for 5-time and followed by chromogen reaction and OD measurements. The
anti-spike titers of IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b were determined as the dilution limit to achieve
a positive result.
Pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titer measurement
Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyping-particles (VSVpp)
were produced according to our previous study (49). The BHK21-hACE2 cells were used
to perform the pseudovirus neutralization assay. Briefly, cells were pre-seeded in 96-well
plates. Serially-diluted (3-fold gradient) samples were incubated with VSVpp inoculum for
1 hour. Next, the mixture was added into seeded BHK21-hACE2 cells. After a further
incubation at 37 °C containing 5% CO2 for 12 hours, fluorescence images were captured
by Opera Phenix or Operetta CLS High-Content Analysis System (PerkinElmer). The
counts of GFP-positive cells of each well were analyzed by the Columbus System
(PerkinElmer). The neutralization titer of each sample was expressed as the maximum
dilution fold (ID50) required to achieve infection inhibition by 50% (50% reduction of GFPpositive cell numbers compared to controls).
Receptor-blocking antibody titer measurement
A cell-based spike function-blocking test (CSBT) was used to characterize the
receptor-blocking antibody titer in animal serum following the previously described
procedure (44). Briefly, the hACE2-mRuby3 293T (293T-ACE2iRb3) cells were seeded in
poly-D-lysine pretreated CellCarrier-96 Black plate at 2×104 cells per well overnight.
Hamster or Cynomolgus monkey sera were diluted in a 2-fold serial dilution with DMEM

medium containing 10% FBS. 11 μL Gamillus-fused SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer (STG) probe
mixed with 44 μL of the diluted sera to a final concentration of 2.5 nM. After removing half
of the medium from the pre-seeded 293T-ACE2iRb3 cells, pipette 50 μl of the mixture into
the wells and incubate 1 hour at 37 °C containing 5% CO2. Subsequently, cell images were
captured by Opera Phenix High-Content Analysis System in confocal mode. Quantitative
image analyses were performed by the Columbus System (PerkinElmer) following the
previously described algorithm (44). The CSBT activities (receptor-blocking antibody titers)
of immunized sera were displayed as ID50, calculated by 4PL curve-fitting in GraphPad
Prism.
Hamster vaccination
Fifty Syrian golden hamsters (male:female=1:1) were used for vaccine immunization
and the SARS-CoV-2 challenge in vivo. For 2-dose vaccination, the vaccines containing
10 μg antigen (RBD or StriFK) formulated with FH002C adjuvant were used to immunize
hamsters (n=6 per group) at Weeks 0 and 2. Another group was vaccinated with FH002C
adjuvant without antigen as a sham control (n=6). For 3-dose vaccination, groups of
hamsters (n=16 per group) received 10 μg StriFK formulated with Al001 or FH002C
adjuvants at Weeks 0, 2, and 6. All hamsters received 200 μL of vaccine injection per dose
via the intramuscular route. Serum samples were collected weekly for antibody analyses.
Cynomolgus monkey vaccination
Eight Cynomolgus monkeys were allocated randomly into four groups (one female and
one male per group). Groups of cynomolgus were injected with 20 μg StriFK with Al001 or
FH002C, or 20 μg RBD with FH002C adjuvant per dose via the intramuscular route for 3
doses. Another group received FH002C adjuvant-only as a sham control. All cynomolgus
were injected 0.5 mL of vaccine or adjuvant-only at Weeks 0, 2, and 6. Serum samples
were collected weekly for biochemical and antibody analyses, including measurement of
anti-spike IgG, pseudovirus neutralizing antibody, and receptor-blocking antibody titers
during the Week 1 to 10. Cynomolgus monkey immunogenicity experiment was conducted
at JOINN Laboratories, Inc (Beijing).

the study. For the former, hamsters were inoculated with 1×104 PFU of the SARS-CoV-2
virus through the intranasal route under anesthesia. For the latter, virus-carried hamsters
(donors) were pre-infected with inoculation of 1×104 PFU of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through
the intranasal route. One day later, every four donors were transferred to a new cage and
were co-housed with four vaccinated or unvaccinated control animals. The hamsters were
fed with a daily food amount of 7 g per 100 g of body weight. The weight changes and
typical symptoms (piloerection, hunched back, and abdominal respiration) in hamsters
were recorded daily since the infection or contact. Hamsters may be sacrificed for tissue
pathological and virological analyses on days 3, 5, or 7 after the virus challenge. The virus
challenging studies were performed in the anmial biosafety level 3 (ABSL-3) facility.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification
Viral RNA levels in lung, trachea, and nasal turbinate from challenged hamsters were
detected by quantitative RT-PCR. Hamster tissue samples were homogenized by
TissueLyser II (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) in 1mL PBS. The RNA was extracted using the
QIAamp Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction.
Subsequently, viral RNA quantification was conducted using SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit
(Wantai, Beijing, China).
SARS-CoV-2 plaque assay
The plaque assays were performed in the biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility. Briefly,
Vero cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at 105 cells per well. After overnight culture, the
medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS. The supernatants of
tissue lysates were serially 10-fold diluted with DMEM and were incubated with the cells.
Cell plates were then incubated for 1 hour at 37 °C containing 5% CO2. Subsequently, the
tissue lysate contained medium was refreshed with a mixture of DMEM containing 1% agar.
After agar solidification, the cell plates were inverted and incubated at 37 °C containing 5%
CO2 for 3 days. Subsequently, cells were fixed with 2 mL of 4% formaldehyde for 2 hours
at room temperature. The cells were further stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 20 min. The
viral load was calculated based on the count of plaques and the corresponding dilution
factor.

The lung tissues from challenged hamsters were fixed with 10% formalin for 48 hours,
then embedded in paraffin and sectioned. Next, the fixed lung sections were subjected to
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Immunohistochemical staining was performed by
using the mouse monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 N proteins antibody. Whole-slide images
of the lung sections were captured by EVOS M7000 Images System (ThermoFisher).
Statistical analysis
The Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison of continuous
variables between groups. The two-way ANOVA test was used to analyze the time-serial
observations for the independent sample. Pearson test and linear regression model were
used for univariate correlation analysis. Statistical significance was considered to be
significant for 2-tailed p values <0.05. Statistical analyses were conducted in GraphPad
Prism 8 software.

The geometric mean titer (GMT) level of pseudovirus nAb of these human samples were
584. The GMT levels of pseudovirus nAb (using the same assay) of StriFK-FH002C
vaccinated mice (related to Figure 1, n=6), hamsters (related to Figure 3, n=22) and
cynomolgus macaques (related to Figure S3, n=2) were included for comparison.

Figure S1. Characterizations of the Al001 and FH002C adjuvants. (A) The appearance
and morphology of Al001 (upper panel) and FH002C (lower panel) observed by cell-phone
camera (left), inverted microscope (middle), and transmission electron microscopy (right).
(B) The potential of zero charge (PZC) of Al001 and FH002C. Zeta potential of Al001 and
FH002C were measured in different pH using NanoBrook Omni zeta potential analyzer
(Brookhaven Instruments Corporation, NY), and the PZC values were calculated by the
instrument software. Each Zeta potential value reported is the average of three replicates.
(C) Size distributions of Al001 (left panel) and FH002C (right panel). The particle size
distribution of adjuvants was measured by using LS 13320 Beckman Coulter Laser Particle
Analyzer (Fullerton, CA). The median particle diameter d50 (equivalent diameter when the
cumulative distribution is 50%) was measured in three independent replicates, mean±SEM.

Figure S2. Characterizations of recombinant StriFK protein. (A) Stable CHO cell pool
produced recombinant StriFK at a high level. SDS-PAGE and western blot analyses for
culture supernatants (unconcentrated) and purified protein derived from an StriFKintegrated stable CHO pool. (B) SEC chromatograms of StriFK protein with protein
standards on a TSK-G3000 column. (C) SPR sensorgrams showing the binding kinetics
for StriFK with immobilized human ACE2. Colored lines represented a global fit of the data
using a 1:1 binding model. (D) ELISA binding activities of human COVID19-convalescent
plasmas to StriFK protein. Twelve representative samples (11 convalescent COVID-19
plasmas and 1 control sample) were used for the tests. (E) Correlation analyses between
the StriFK-binding titer and the pseudovirus neutralizing antibody titer (colored in blue), the
authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus-neutralizing antibody titer (colored in red), and the receptorblocking antibody titer (colored in yellow) among human plasmas.

Figure S3. The IgG avidity and IgG subclass of spike-specific antibodies induced by
StriFK-FH002C and StriFK-Al001 in mice. BALB/c mice were immunized at Weeks 0 and
2 with 1 μg/dose of StriFK-FH002C (n=5) or StriFK-Al001 (n=4). (A) Serum IgG avidities of
immunized mice at Weeks 3, 4, and 5. The ratio of ED50 (urea-treated) to ED50 (untreated
control) was used to measure the avidity of the serum polyclonal antibody to StriFK. (B)
Serum anti-spike binding titers of IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b for immunized mice. Sera were
collected 2 weeks post the 2nd dose administration. (C) Antibody titer ratios of IgG2a to
IgG1 and IgG2b to IgG1 were calculated. Unpaired t-test was used for statistical
comparison. Related to Figure 1C.
