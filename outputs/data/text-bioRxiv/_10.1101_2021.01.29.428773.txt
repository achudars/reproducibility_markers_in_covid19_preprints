Despite sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated greater

24

widespread virulence and unique challenges to researchers aiming to study its pathogenicity in

25

humans. The interaction of the viral receptor binding domain (RBD) with its main host cell

26

receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), has emerged as a critical focal point for the

27

development of anti-viral therapeutics and vaccines. Utilizing our recently developed NanoBiT

28

technology-based biosensor, we selectively identify and characterize the impact of mutating

29

certain amino acid residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and in ACE2. Specifically, we examine

30

the mutational effects on RBD-ACE2 binding ability, before and after the addition of competitive

31

inhibitors, as well as neutralizing antibody activity. These critical determinants of virus-host

32

interactions may provide more effective targets for ongoing vaccines, drug development, and

33

potentially pave the way for determining the genetic variation underlying disease severity.

47

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiologic agent

48

responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic and is an ongoing worldwide public health threat. As of

49

October 16th 2020, there have been over 39 million confirmed cases, and over 1 million confirmed

50

deaths

51

https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports).

52

Tremendous efforts are currently underway to develop rapid drug screening methodologies and

53

novel vaccines. The large variability of disease severity among individuals infected with SARS-

54

CoV-2 continues to be investigated [1] and new findings in this field may shed light on strategies

55

to tailor these new therapeutics to patients.

resulting

from

SARS-CoV-2

infection

(WHO

reports,

56

Entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by interaction of the viral Spike glycoprotein (S) with

57

its main target receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), found on the surface of

58

mammalian cells, primarily in the lower respiratory tract [2]. The S protein is composed of two

59

subunits, S1 and S2, which play cooperatively a role in viral entry and fusion of the viral membrane

60

with host cell membrane. Binding to ACE2 is mediated by the receptor binding domain (RBD),

61

located in the C-terminus of the S1 subunit [3]. The identification of amino acid residues that are

62

crucial for the interaction of RBD with ACE2 is of great interest to gain a better understanding of

63

the interplay between viral entry and host genetic factors which may contribute to the observed

64

variability in disease pathogenesis. As such, characterizing functional mutants of RBD and ACE2

65

may provide critical insights for the development of drugs and vaccines.

66

The development of biosensor technology is a highly valuable and sensitive analytical tool

67

with a broad spectrum of applications, such as diagnosis and drug development [4, 5]. Biosensors

68

designed to emit bioluminescence often rely on luciferase, a class of enzymes that catalyze

69

substrate to produce a bioluminescent signal. One such tool is the NanoLuc Binary Technology

70

(NanoBiT), which enables rapid analysis of protein-protein interactions through use of

71

Nanoluciferase, a small luciferase reporter [5-12]. By exploiting this technology, we have recently

72

developed an assay to rapidly investigate RBD and ACE2 interactions. In addition, this assay can

73

be used to elucidate the impact of both RBD and ACE2 amino acid mutations on their binding

74

abilities, as well as their potential implications for drug development and evaluating immune

75

responses.

76

Previous studies have examined crucial residues in ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-1 Spike

77

domain [13, 14]. Similarly, recent studies have begun to unravel important interactions in SARS-

78

CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 [15]. While some progress has been made towards examining the impact

79

of specific mutations within the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2, there remain much to be studied

80

with regards to their impact on binding, infectivity and host susceptibility to viral infection. In

81

addition, the impact of specific RBD mutations on the efficacy of potential therapeutics has not

82

been explored. For example, most vaccines under development are designed to contain the RBD

83

domain of S, and sequencing data has shown that RBD is among the most non-conservative domain

84

in SARS-CoV-2 S [16]. Thus, the question that still remain is whether SARS-CoV-2 viruses

85

harboring select RBD mutations would be controlled by immune responses mounted against the

86

RBD sequence encoded in the original virus strain. Another unexplored area is whether variations

87

in host ACE2 sequences could alter virus susceptibility and/or disease severity among individuals

88

or species. Comparisons on how mutations in ACE2 affect binding of the RBD from SARS-CoV-1

89

versus SARS-CoV-2 have yet to be performed. We believe that elucidating which variations may

90

have an impact in the ACE2: SARS-CoV-2 S binding affinity is worth investigating since this

91

information could impact the development of therapeutic options for COVID-19 patients. Here,

92

we investigate whether any of these critical amino acid sites in ACE2 exist in the human population

93

and may explain severity of the disease.

94

2. Results and Discussion

95

The first crucial step of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry is mediated by binding of RBD to ACE2,

96

its main cognate receptor expressed on the surface of the human airway epithelium (Figure 1A).

97

In this study, we aim to investigate whether selected mutations in both SARS-CoV-2 S protein

98

RBD and its host receptor ACE2 could impact their interactions with one another. We also examine

99

how specific mutations in ACE and RBD may alter the efficacy of drugs and neutralizing

100

antibodies being developed for treatment and disease prevention purposes, respectively. To

101

accomplish these aims, we use a NanoBiT SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2 biosensor, previously

102

developed by our lab, to initially characterize the RBD: ACE2 interaction (Figure 1B) [17]. The

103

molecular basis of this technology involves the fusion of a Large Bit (LgBiT) subunit to one of the

104

proteins of interest, and the fusion of a Small Bit subunit (SmBiT) to the second protein being

105

investigated. As illustrated in Figure 1B, LgBiT and SmBiT alone have poor affinity for one

106

another; however, both subunits interact to produce a bioluminescent signal in the presence of

107

furimazine, the substrate for Nanoluciferase, if the fusion proteins interact with each other.

108

Mutations within the ACE2 ectodomain alter binding affinity of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2

109

RBD, SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit, and SARS-CoV-1 RBD

110

ACE2 is a key interacting partner involved in SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, thus we first

111

performed in silico mutagenesis analysis to assess putative ACE2 mutants that could be potentially

112

defective at interacting with SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Based on the overall 3D crystal structure analysis

113

of ACE2 bound to RBD (Figure 2A, B), we selectively identified 22 sites in ACE2, which are

114

most likely involved in ACE: RBD direct interaction (Figure 2 A-D). To analyze the contribution

115

of these 22 mutants on their ability to interact with RBD using our NanoBiT based biosensor

116

technology, we first engineered the 22 amino acid mutants of ACE2 (Figure 2E) and linked them

117

to SmBiT. Expression of ACE2 mutants from transfected HEK293T cells was demonstrated by

118

immunoblotting (Figure 3A).

119

We then investigated the binding affinity of ACE2 wild-type and mutants with both SARS-

120

CoV-2-RBD and SARS-CoV-2 S1 as complementary binding partner. The rationale for also

121

including an S1-based NanoBiT binding partner in our assays was that RBD is encompassed within

122

the S1 subunit of the S glycoprotein. Hence, including S1 would more closely mimic SARS-CoV-2

123

S behavior in the context of viral infection. Thus, we proceeded to compare whether S1 fused to

124

LgBiT and RBD-LgBiT constructs have similar binding affinity for ACE and its mutants. When

125

combined with SARS-CoV-2-RBD-LgBiT, 12 of the 22 mutants of ACE2 showed a significant

126

decrease in their binding affinity (Figure 3B). Specifically, ACE2 mutants Q24A, F28A, D38A,

127

Y41A, K353A, G354D, D355A, R357A, and NFS (residues 82-84) demonstrated reduced binding

128

to SARS-CoV-2-RBD (Figure 3B). We also found that 13 of the 22 mutants showed a significant

129

decrease in binding to S1 (Figure 3C). Specifically, ACE2 mutants Q24A, F28A, D38A, Y41A,

130

Q42A, L45A, M82A, Y83A, K353A, G354D, D355A, R357A, and NFS had reduced binding to

131

SARS-CoV-2 S1 (Figure 3C). In summary, we found that the same 12 ACE2 mutants that showed

132

decreased binding to SARS CoV-2 RBD also has impaired interactions with SARS CoV-2 S1,

133

with the addition of mutant Y83A that reported a reduced affinity for SARS-CoV-1 S1 only.

134

Since structural analysis has shown that certain residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBD are well

135

conserved within SARS-CoV-1 RBD [17], we decided to also combined the various ACE2-SmBiT

136

mutants with a LgBiT-SARS-CoV-1 RBD construct. This allowed us to also evaluate how ACE2

137

mutations could impact ACE2 : SARS-CoV-1 RBD interaction. In figure 3D, we further show that

138

14 different ACE2 mutations (T27D, F28A, H34A, E35A, E37A, Y41A, Q42A, L45A, Y83A,

139

K353A, G354D, D355A, R357A, and NFS) significantly alter its respective binding efficiency to

140

the wild type SARS-CoV-1 RBD. Of note, ten of these ACE2 mutants are in common with SARS-

141

CoV-2 RBD. These data suggest that in comparison with SARS-CoV-1 RBD, SARS-CoV-2 RBD

142

may be slightly more resistant to ACE2 mutants, which may arise from single nucleotide

143

polymorphisms (SNPs). This observation may have implications with regards to viral

144

susceptibility of various species or individuals based on their ACE2 gene sequence.

145

SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotyped lentiviral particle assay confirm that mutations within the

146

ACE2 ectodomain alter binding affinity of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 RBD

147

To reinforce the ACE2 mutational findings observed with our biosensor technology

148

described above, we then decided to utilize a lentiviral-based pseudovirus infectivity assay. We

149

hypothetized that ACE2 mutants which retain their binding capacity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD should

150

act as competitive inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus binding to ACE2 in the host cell, and

151

thus reducing its infectivity (Figure 4A). To test this notion, we combined each of the 22 ACE2

152

mutants with SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus expressing luciferase, and then added the

153

pre-treated pseudovirus samples to HEK293X cells expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (the host

154

protease responsible for cleaving S glycoprotein[18]). We then measured the infectivity with a

155

luciferase assay - a lower signal is indicative of reduced infection, resulting from ACE2 mutants

156

retaining RBD binding capacity, thereby acting as competitive inhibitors (Figure 4B). These

157

results very closely align with mutant binding affinity changes observed with our biosensor

158

technology (Figure 3B-C).

159

Utilizing ACE2 sequences as a predictor for the SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility of various

160

species and mutation prevalence in humans

161

Our findings suggest that identification of ACE2 amino acid sites which impact RBD

162

binding may provide insights as to SARS-CoV-2 susceptibilities of different individuals or species

163

based on their genetics. Using multiple sequence alignments of the 12 target mutation sites

164

identified to be essential for RBD binding (Figure 3), we propose a method to predict SARS-CoV-

165

2 virus susceptibility (Figure 5A). It is plausible to hypothetize that any species with an identical

166

ACE2 amino acid sequence to the human ACE2 receptor would theoretically be highly susceptible

167

to the virus, and possibly act as a source of transmission, such as the common chimpanzee (Pan

168

troglodytes; Figure 5A). With the presence of only one or two differences at key ACE2 binding

169

sites, it is likely that species such as Tursiops truncatus (bottlenose dolphin) or Cricetulus griseus

170

(Chinese hamster) would still be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, species such as

171

domesticated horses (Equus caballus) or brown rats (Rattus norvegicus), which have many

172

differences at key ACE2 residues, are expected to be less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection,

173

due to reduced binding efficiency between ACE2 and RBD. With reduced binding efficacy, viral

174

infection and spread would likely be impaired in these animals, leading them to pose less of a risk

175

for shedding large amounts of infectious virus potentially leading to reduced viral pathogenesis

176

(Figure 5A). These findings are consistent with literature studies of optimal SARS-CoV-2 disease

177

models [19]. For example, increasing studies have indicated that hamsters are a better suited

178

animal model to study SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to mice [20].

179

Looking at the prevalence of these mutations in people, we observe that some of these

180

SNPs (namely NFS, G354, and D355) already exist in a small fraction of the population (Figure

181

5B). Our data suggest the possibility that individuals harboring these SNPs may be more resistant

182

to the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Genetic differences in the ACE2 receptor of individuals may

183

also provide a partial explanation for the variability in disease severity among individuals.

184

Interestingly, in silico studies from other groups have also suggested that genetic influences cause

185

interindividual variability in ACE2 expression [21], [22]. In this study, we experimentally

186

validated for the first time the effects of ACE2 mutants on RBD binding affinity, which may pave

187

the path for clinical studies.

188
189

Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 RBD that alter its ability to bind to ACE2 do not impact the
activity of a competitive inhibitor nor the efficacy of a neutralizing antibody

192

A key concern surrounding RNA viruses, and viruses in general, is their capacity to evolve

193

through the accumulation of mutations. Such mutations may drive resistance to therapeutics and/or

194

evasion of host immune responses acquired through infection or vaccination against the wild-type

195

virus. Recently two mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD have been reported in Africa and the UK.

196

We have investigated one of the critical mutation sites reported by the UK, asparagine residue at

197

location 501 (N501), by altering the residue to both to Alanine and Tyrosine in silico (Figure 6

198

A-D). The change to alanine preserved the internal interactions of the residue with two glutamine

199

residues at positions 498 and 506 but abolished the interaction with tyrosine 41 in ACE2. However,

200

mutation to the tyrosine variant preserved all internal interactions and slightly strengthened them.

201

Moreover, this mutation introduced a new strong interaction site, 2.3 A, with lysine 353 in ACE2

202

structure. Another recently discovered mutation is the change of glutamic acid at position 484 to

203

lysine. We did not detect any significant change in internal or RBD-ACE2 interaction sites which

204

may be due to the fact that this residue is located in a very flexible loop structure (Figure 6E-F).

205
206

Additionaly, we selected 16 of the 25 RBD mutants used in our recent study which retained

207

some level of ACE2 binding capacity to further assess the effects of a competitive inhibitor and a

208

neutralizing antibody with our biosensor assay. From a therapeutic perspective, recombinant RBD

209

is under clinical consideration for use as a potential viral attachment inhibitor, given its ability to

210

competitively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus particles [24]. We found that recombinant RBD

211

expressed from mammalian cells wascapable of out-competing all 16 of the RBD mutants

212

tested(Figure 6I). These results suggest that competitive drugs developed to combat the wild-type

213

virus are still applicable to virus strains which may acquire these mutations in the RBD domain

214

leading to reduced receptor binding over time. Neutralizing antibodies (nAb) play a key role in

215

generating protective immunity against viral agents, and are developed through exposure to the

216

virus itself, or to viral antigens in the form of a vaccine. We found that addition of a nAb

217

significantly decreased, if not abolished, the interaction between all examined RBD mutants and

218

ACE2 (Figure 6J). Importantly, this data may indicate that these receptor binding mutations do not

219

provide an immune evasive advantage to the virus, and as a result, should not pose a serious threat

220

to the efficacy of developed vaccines, and immunity, to viruses harboring these mutations.

221

Conservation of RBD across coronavirus strains

222

We used multiple sequence alignment tools to further investigate amino acid conservation

223

patterns of the RBD mutants under examination across multiple betacoronavirus strains. This

224

analysis could provide interesting insights on the possible contributions of these specific residues

225

in RBD and their link to infectivity. The variation in amino acid sites is indicative of which amino

226

acids are critical for maintaining the structural integrity of RBD, and which can be modified for

227

therapeutic purposes. For example, amino acid C361 is present in the bottom of the RBD core, and

228

not at the contact site. Considering the cross-species conservation of this residue, it may exert an

229

important role in stabilizing the overall structure of the protein. Of the analyzed amino acids, K417

230

was the only one which was not part of RBM, yet is still in close proximity to the contact site,

231

providing important contact with residue D30 in the ACE2 structure [3]. Of the other

232

Betacoronavirus species analyzed in this study, the presence of K417 is limited to SARS-CoV-2.

233

This unique event could be aone of the possible reason for which SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a higher

234

binding efficiency to ACE2 compared to other viruses in the same family. It is also likely to expect

235

that Betacoronaviruses harboring low amino acid sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-2 likely

236

utilize a different host receptor for viral entry. In addition, when analyzing tyrosine residues at

237

positionY449 and Y505, it seems that the hydroxyl (OH) group in the tyrosine side chain may

238

possibly contact two different amino acids on ACE2 structure, appearing critical for effective

239

binding of the receptor-ligand structure. Precisely, Y449 contacts D38 and Q42 in ACE2, and

240

Y505 contacts E37 and R393 in ACE2, respectively [3].

241

Elucidating which amino acids are conserved and occupy critical roles in viral ligand-host

242

receptor binding could deepen our understanding of antiviral drug development. To increase the

243

spectrum of antiviral agents directed towards betacoronaviruses, targeting conserved amino acids

244

which are crucial for receptor binding may prove to be an interesting strategy. Given the

245

conservation of amino acids between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS, it would be of

246

interest to develop a therapeutics targeting this triad of viruses.

247

It has been theorized that the SARS-CoV-2 virus originated from bats, was then transmitted

248

to pangolins, and finally spilled over to humans [25], [26], [27]. We examined the conservation of

249

the 25 RBD point mutants generated in our study to determine if variations in amino acid sequence

250

would follow the predicted path of interspecies transmission. Interestingly, these sites were mostly

251

conserved across all three species, with only three sites (V445, F486, and Y505) differing in bat

252

CoV, when compared to pangolin Co-V and human SARS-CoV-2, and only one site (K417)

253

differing in pangolin CoV compared to the bat and human viruses (Figure 7). These observations

254

are in line with a recent report by Liu et al. [27]. In this study, the authors aligned the full-length

255

spike sequence of SARS-CoV-2, Pangolin-CoV and Bat-CoV-RaTG13. These results and our

256

predictions reported herein support the hypothesis that the path of viral transmission originated

257

from bats, continued to pangolins as intermediate hosts, and then followed its dispersal route to

258

the human population.

259

3. Conclusions

260

In this study, we provide for the first time a comprehensive overview of the effects of select

261

mutations in both the ectodomain of ACE2 and the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings suggest

262

that ACE2 SNPs in the human population may account for the variability in infectivity and disease

263

progression in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, our observations from RBD

264

mutational scanning also provide potential sites for drug targeting and therapeutic development.

265

By combining ACE2 and RBD mutational analyses, we provide insights into the genetics

266

underlying virus susceptibility and the development of possible therapeutic targets.

incubator at 5% CO2. Cells are routinely tested for mycoplasma by PCR testing, and used for up

273

to 20 passages after thawing.

274

4.2. Plasmids

275

Engineered inserts are outlined in Supplementary Table 1 (GenScript). All biosensor subunits were

276

cloned into the BamHI/NotI sites of pcDNA3.1 to generate mammalian expression constructs.

278

HEK293T cells were grown in 100 mm or 150 mm cell culture dishes to 70% confluence. Cells

279

were transfected with 10 µg of DNA using PolyJet (SignaGen) according to manufacturer’s

280

protocol. 48 hours post-transfection, cell supernatants or cell lysates were harvested for subsequent

281

testing.

282

4.4. In vitro NanoBit assay

283

293T cells were lysed using passive lysis buffer (Promega). NanoBiT assays were performed using

284

native coelenterazine (CTZ; 3.33 mM final concentration; Nanolight Technologies – Prolume Ltd.,

285

Pinetop, AZ, USA). Synergy Microplate Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) was used to

286

measure luminescence. Results are presented as raw RLU (Relative Luminescence Unit), or

287

normalized to control where indicated. The data presented are the mean of three biological

288

replicates.

289

4.5. Western immunoblotting

290

293T cells were lysed using passive lysis buffer. Protein concentration in clarified whole cell

291

lysates was quantified using bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) (Pierce). 20 µg of total protein was

292

prepared in 1x Laemmli buffer, loaded into 4-12% gradient Bis-Tris acrylamide gels and resolved.

293

Following transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane, blots were incubated in 0.1% Ponceau S solution

294

(in 5% v/v acetic acid-distilled water) for 5 minutes at room temperature, imaged, then washed

295

with TBST for 10 minutes. Blots were then blocked using 5% skimed milk powder in TBST for 1

296

hour. Blots were subsequently probed using anti-beta-actin primary antibody (1:5000), anti-HA

297

tag (1:1000), or anti-FLAG tag (1:1000) in 5% milk overnight at 4°C. Following washing with

298

TBST, membranes were probed with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10000) in 5% milk

299

at room temperature for 1 hour. Blots were washed with TBST, then developed using BioRad

300

Clarity-Western ECL and the BioRad ChemiDoc imaging system.

301

4.6. Lentiviral Pseudovirus Assay

302

Plasmid encoding SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped lentivirus was kindly provided by Dr. Jesse

303

Bloom (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA) and lentivirus was generated as

304

previously described (Crawford et. al., 2020). HEK293T cells were seeded in 6 wells plates to

305

70% confluency and were transfected with 1ug of individual smBiT ACE2 mutant DNA using

306

PolyJet (SignaGen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. 48 hours post-transfection, supernatants

307

of transfected cells were harvested. Pseudotyped lentiviruses were incubated with each of the

308

smBiT-ACE2 mutant containing supernatants for 1 hour at 37°C. Immediately following the

309

incubation period, polyclonal HEK293X cells stably overexpressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were

310

transduced in 96 well format (300 000 cells). 4 hours post-transduction all media was replaced. 48

311

hours post-transduction, cells were lysed using 1X PLB, cell lysates were transferred to an opaque

312

96-well plate, and infection efficiency was measured by luciferase assay using the Bright-Glo

313

Luciferase Assay system following manufacturer’s protocols (Promega).

314

4.7. Statistical analysis

315

All graphs and statistical analyses were generated in Excel or GraphPad Prism v.8. Means of two

316

groups were compared using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test. Means of more than two groups

317

were compared by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s or Tukey’s multiple comparisons correction.

318

Alpha levels for all tests were 0.05, with a 95% confidence interval. Error is graphed as the

319

standard deviation (SD). Measurements were taken from distinct samples (biological replicates).

320

For all analyses, *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.005, n.s. = not significant.

321

4.8. Multiple Sequence Alignment of ACE2 and Spike Sequences, and finding ACE2 SNPs in

322

the target positions

323

All of the represented sequences were retrieved from NCBI refseq protein database. Multiple

324

sequence alignment (MSA) was performed using Clustal Omega (Madeira et.al., 2019) algorithm

325

with default parameters. Alignments were visualized and prepared for illustration using Jalview

326

software (Waterhouse et.al., 2009). The multiple sequence alignment of ACE2 polypeptides was

327

reordered based on the binding efficiency data in the J. Damas et al (Damas et.al., 2020). The

328

NCBI dbSNP database was searched for possible single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in

329

target mutation sites and the related information were gathered in a table using Microsoft Excel.
