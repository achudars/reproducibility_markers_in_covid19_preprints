The baculovirus-insect cell expression system is readily utilized to produce viral glycoproteins for
research as well as for subunit vaccines and vaccine candidates, for instance against SARS-CoV-2
infections. However, the glycoforms of recombinant proteins derived from this expression system
are inherently different from mammalian cell-derived glycoforms with mainly complex-type Nglycans attached, and the impact of these differences in protein glycosylation on the
immunogenicity is severely underinvestigated. This applies also to the SARS-CoV-2 spike
glycoprotein, which is the antigen target of all licensed vaccines and vaccine candidates including
virus like particles and subunit vaccines that are variants of the spike protein. Here, we expressed
the transmembrane-deleted human β-1,2 N-acetlyglucosamintransferases I and II (MGAT1ΔTM
and MGAT2ΔTM) and the β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (GalTΔTM) in E. coli to in-vitro remodel
the N-glycans of a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein derived from insect cells. In a
cell-free sequential one-pot reaction, fucosylated and afucosylated paucimannose-type N-glycans
were converted to complex-type galactosylated N-glycans. In the future, this in-vitro
glycoengineering approach can be used to efficiently generate a wide range of N-glycans on
antigens considered as vaccine candidates for animal trials and preclinical testing to better
characterize the impact of N-glycosylation on immunity and to improve the efficacy of protein
subunit vaccines.

Most epidemics caused by viral infections that are associated with a significant death toll were
caused by enveloped viruses such as influenza A virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
Zika virus, Yellow fever virus, Dengue virus and Ebolavirus. Often, the main target for
neutralizing antibodies to evoke a strong immune response is a glycosylated envelope
membrane protein. Thus, in the development of vaccines, glycoproteins are typically in the
focus of interest. In general, the glycosylation of proteins plays a critical role regarding structure,
function, solubility, stability, trafficking, and ligand-binding (Imperiali and O’Connor,
1999;Dalziel et al., 2014;Varki, 2017). Furthermore, glycosylation plays a major role for
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of biologics and for pathogen-host interaction
(Bagdonaite and Wandall, 2018;Cymer et al., 2018;Watanabe et al., 2019). In viral
pathogenesis, glycosylation affects the attachment and release of virus particles as well as
immune evasion (Schön et al.;Bagdonaite and Wandall, 2018;Watanabe et al., 2019).
Especially the latter is a major hurdle for vaccine design. The mode of actions that are known
to be employed to invade the immune system are secretion and shedding of glycoproteins that
function as a decoy to the immune system, and the shielding of epitopes (Watanabe et al., 2019).
The latter is facilitated by occluding antigenic epitopes with host-derived glycans that are
obtained through hijacking the host’s cellular glycosylation machinery (Pralow et al.;Schwarzer
et al., 2009;Francica et al., 2010;Helle et al., 2011;Rödig et al., 2011;Rödig et al.,
2013;Sommerstein et al., 2015;Behrens et al., 2016;Gram et al., 2016;Walls et al., 2016).
Moreover, it has been shown that also the glycoform itself can have an impact on binding and
transmission assay as well as on transmissibility, antigenicity, and immunogenicity in animal
models (Lin et al., 2003;Hütter et al., 2013;Chen et al., 2014;Li et al., 2016;Go et al., 2017).
While it is assumed that immunogenic antigens benefit from mimicking the glycosylation of
host cell proteins, it has also been proposed that modification of specific terminal sugar residues
could be used to amplify vaccine efficacy (Galili, 2020;Chen, 2021). However, due to the
complexity of protein glycosylation and the prevailing lack of methods to introduce defined
modifications in the glycan composition of the proteins of interest, the topic is
underinvestigated (Schön et al.;Watanabe et al., 2019;Grant et al., 2020).

The ongoing corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) – a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA
virus (Walls et al., 2020). Its membrane envelope consists of three membrane proteins: the
surface spike (S) glycoprotein, an integral membrane protein and an envelope protein (Wan et
al., 2020;Zhou et al., 2020). Virus entry into human host cells is mediated by the S glycoprotein
that binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (Walls et al., 2020). The S protein has 22
N-linked glycosylation sites. Thus, it is significantly more glycosylated than, for instance, the
influenza A hemagglutinin (Wrapp et al., 2020). For the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein it has been
shown previously that N-glycans significantly impact antibody response and neutralizing
antibody levels (Chen et al., 2014;Walls et al., 2020).

For the investigation of the impact of glycoforms on the immunogenicity, mainly animal cell
lines such as HEK and CHO cells that produce differentially glycosylated proteins are
employed (Schön et al.;Lin et al., 2013). However, due to need to develop specific expression
protocols for each cell line, this approach is highly work-intensive. Additionally, the inherent
macro- and microheterogeneity of glycoproteins complicate the elucidation of the role of
specific glycans in, for instance, regarding their immunogenicity in animal models.

Over the past years the establishment of protocols for expression of eukaryotic and bacterial
glycosyltransferases has facilitated the processing of glycans in cell-free one-pot reactions. As
a platform technology, the corresponding in-vitro glycoengineering approaches have the
potential to tailor the glycoform of proteins independent of the expression systems used (Van

In our study, recombinant human β-1,2 Nacetlyglucosamintransferases I and II (MGAT1ΔTM and MGAT2 ΔTM) and the β-1,4galactosyltransferase (GalTΔTM) expressed in E. coli were utilized to convert insect cellderived paucimannose structures of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein to typical
mammalian, complex-type galactosylated structures in a cell-free one-pot reaction (Fujiyama
et al., 2001;Boeggeman et al., 2003;Bendiak, 2014;Ramakrishnan and Qasba, 2014;Stanley,

2.1.2. Purification by ion metal affinity chromatography - E. coli cells were lysed at 4°C by
high-pressure cell disruption (3 cycles, 400-600 bar) using an HPL6 homogenizer (Maximator
GmbH, Nordhausen, Germany) followed by centrifugation at 7200 x g for 20 min at 4°C to
precipitate cell debris. The overexpressed enzymes were filtered through 8 µm syringe filters
and then purified by ion metal chromatography using an ÄKTA™ start system equipped with
HisTrap™ HP columns (1 mL) (both GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK). A
buffer exchange was carried out to remove excess imidazole using an Amicon® Ultra-15
Centrifugal Filter Unit – 3 kDa MW cutoff (UFC900308, Darmstadt, Germany) using standard
procedures. Enzymes were stored in 50% (v/v) glycerol stock solutions at -20°C. Enzyme

conducted using a glyXboxCE™-system (glyXera, Magdeburg, Germany) according to
(Hennig et al., 2015;Hennig et al., 2016). Briefly, 2 µL of each sample was used for fluorescent

derivatization clean-up by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-solid phase extraction
(HILIC-SPE) with the glyXprep16™ kit (glyXera). Data processing, normalization of

2.2.3. MALDI-TOF-MS-based N-Glycan Analysis - MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of released Nglycans was performed as described previously (Selman et al., 2011;Fischöder et al., 2019).
Briefly, 0.9 cm cotton rope was used for Cotton HILIC SPE. The stationary phase was
equilibrated with 50 µL LC-MS grade H2O followed by 50 µL 85% ACNaq. 10 µL of released
N-glycans were adjusted to 70 µL 85% ACNaq with 1% TFA and loaded onto the HILIC phase.
Following 2 washing steps with 50 µL 85% ACNaq with 1% TFA and 50 µL 85% ACNaq, the
samples were eluted in 70 µL LC-MS grade H2O, vacuum evaporated and dissolved in 20 µL
LC-MS grade H2O. For the MALDI-TOF-MS analysis 0.5 µL super-dihydroxybenzoic acid (SDHB) (≥99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) matrix (10 mg/mL) in 30% (v/v) ACNaq,
0.1% (v/v) TFA, 2 mM NaCl was spotted onto a MTP AnchorChip 800/384 TF MALDI target
(Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Subsequently 1 µL sample was applied onto the dried
matrix layer. Measurements were carried out on an ultrafleXtreme MALDI-TOF/TOF MS
(Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) in reflectron positive ion mode. Data was processed with
the top-hat filter and the adjacent-averaging algorithm using flexAnalysis version 3.3 Build 80

N-Glycan nomenclature was adopted from Stanley et al (Stanley et al., 2015). Depiction of Nglycan structures followed the Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans (SNFG) guidelines
(Neelamegham et al., 2019). The N-glycan sketches in this manuscript were produced using the
“Glycan Builder2” software tool (Tsuchiya et al., 2017). N-Glycans are typically categorized
into paucimannose-, oligomannose-, hybrid- and complex-type structures.

The human in-vivo cascade reaction for the generation of complex-type N-glycans from the
conserved ER-derived oligomannose-type N-glycan precursor GlcNAc2Man9Glc3, was in part
remodelled in-vitro to generate fully galactosylated complex-type N-glycans starting from
insect cell-derived paucimannose-type N-glycans. Central to the construction of the simplified
in-vitro cascade is the ability of human MGAT1 to utilize Man3 and Man3F as substrates, which
allows circumventing the application of recombinant mannosidases (see Figure 1). For the
production of the G2 structure from paucimannose-type N-glycans, the three recombinant
glycosyltransferases MGAT1ΔTM, MGAT2ΔTM and GalTΔTM were successfully produced
in E. coli (see SI). Enzyme concentrations of typically 1.3 mg/mL after ion metal affinity
chromatography (IMAC) and buffer exchange were obtained. In scouting experiments, it was
confirmed that all enzymes are active in the buffered solutions (pH 6.5) with MnCl2
supplemented as a co-factor (data not shown).

Analytical characterization of the unprocessed and glycoengineered SARS-CoV 2 spike protein
was achieved by the two orthogonal methods xCGE-LIF and MALDI-TOF-MS (see Figure 2
and Figure 3). The high-resolution N-glycan fingerprints (migration time aligned & and peak
height normalized electropherograms) from xCGE-LIF combined with the precise mass profiles
generated by MALDI-TOF-MS allowed for fast and robust annotation also of isomeric Nglycan structures. Furthermore, normalization of N-glycan fingerprints to total peak height
enabled relative quantification of individual N-glycan structures by xCGE-LIF. The insect-cellproduced recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein prominently displays α-1,6-corefucosylated Man3F and G0F-Gn(3) structures (Figure 2A blue and Figure 3A). Moreover,
Man2F, Man3, the hybrid-type structure G0-Gn(3), the complex-type structure G0F, and
afucosylated oligomannose-type structures were detected. There is excellent agreement
between xCGE-LIF and MALDI-TOF-MS measurements.

Recombinant MGAT1ΔTM, MGAT2ΔTM and GalTΔTM were used in a one-pot
glycoengineering reaction to convert the paucimannose structures to complex-type N-glycans.
In scouting experiments it was found that after MGAT1ΔTM, MGAT2ΔTM and GalTΔTM
addition at the start of the reaction, Man3F was converted to, at least in parts, to the hybrid-type
structure G1F-Gn(3) missing the extension on the α1-6 mannosylated antenna catalysed by
MGAT2. G1F-Gn(3) is not a natural substrate for MGAT2 and can, if at all, most likely only
be processed at very low turnover rates. Thus, the reactions were carried out by adding the
enzymes sequentially as detailed in M&M. In the first step, a GlcNAc residue is added from
UDP-GlcNAc to the α-1,3-linked terminal mannose antenna of Man3F and Man3 by
MGAT1ΔTM (see Figure 2A and Figure3A and B). After a reaction time of 12 h only parts of
Man3 and Man3F were converted to G0-Gn(3) and G0F-Gn(3), respectively. Scouting
experiment showed that the conversion is typically irreversible and, thus, the incomplete
processing is either due to low turnover or possible enzyme inactivation of MGAT1ΔTM.
Another possibility is that the glycans are inaccessible for MGAT1ΔTM but can be released
from the backbone by PNGase F. In the second step, UDP-GlcNAc and MGAT2ΔTM are added.
After incubation for 12 h, the hybrid-type structures G0-Gn(3) and G0F-Gn(3) were converted

to G0 and G0F, respectively, with only a minor fraction of G0F-Gn(3) remaining (Figure 2B
and Figure C). MGAT2ΔTM did not show any activity towards Man3 and Man3F. However,
as mentioned before, this could be due the inaccessibility of these glycans. In the final step, the
reaction was supplemented with UDP-galactose and GalTΔTM to add galactose to the terminal
GlcNAc. At the end point of the reaction, after another 12 h of incubation, the galactosylated
complex-type structure G2 was dominant along unprocessed Man3F (see Figure 2C and Figure
3D). Moreover, G0 was completely converted to G2 while the residual amount of the hybridtype structure G0F-Gn(3) was also galactosylated to G1F-Gn(3). All oligomannose-type
structures remained unaltered throughout the reaction. In general, the xCGE-LIF and the
MALDI-TOF-MS data were in excellent agreement for all measurements.

Due to its scalability, eukaryotic protein processing and high productivity, the baculovirusinsect cell expression system is well-suited for the production of subunit vaccines (Palomares
et al.;Felberbaum, 2015). In addition to subunit vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infections in
development, there are currently three licensed vaccines, Flublok®, Cervarix® and Provenge®
produced using this expression system with several more in clinical trials (Palomares et
al.;Felberbaum, 2015).

High immunogenicity of a recombinant insect-cell produced spike protein ectodomain variant,
very similar to the one used here, has been confirmed in non-human primates [40]. Moreover,
the spike protein is the antigen target of virtually all COVID-19 vaccines and advanced vaccine
candidates (Krammer, 2020). At the time of writing this article, there was one licensed COVID19 protein subunit vaccine (RBD-Dimer from Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical,
China) in China, while for two more candidates (Covovax from Novavax, USA; VAT00002
from Sanofi Pasteur and GSK, France / UK) emergency authorization was pending in the US
and Europe (Yang et al., 2020;Dai and Gao, 2021;Shrotri et al., 2021). All three are recombinant
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants produced using the baculovirus-insect cell expression
system (Kyriakidis et al., 2021).

Glycoforms of recombinant proteins produced using baculovirus-insect cell expression systems
are profoundly different from those produced using mammalian expression systems. An
extensive review on the glycosylation processing of insect cells is given by Geisler et al (Geisler
et al., 2015). Typically, these proteins display mainly paucimannose and hybrid-type N-glycans
with, at most, minor fractions of complex-type and oligomannose-type N-glycans (Palomares
et al.;Geisler et al., 2015). In this respect, the glycoform we observed on the pure spike protein
variants is exemplary for an insect cell protein expression.

For vaccine development, it has been proposed that immunogen candidates benefit from closely
mimicking the macro- and microheterogeneity of the live virus glycosylation (Grant et al.,
2020;Watanabe et al., 2020). This is as eliciting antibodies against shielded or non-native
epitopes could cause an inefficient immune response. To overcome such obstacles, novel
strategies utilizing distinct non-human glycans containing N-glycolylneuraminic acid or α,1-3
linked galactose residues, have been proposed to alleviate immune responses (Schön et
al.;Hütter et al., 2013;Galili, 2020;Chen, 2021). However, such approaches still need to be
investigated in detail experimentally as, for example, both compounds are also suspected to
cause allergenic reactions in humans.

To convert the glycoform from primarily paucimannose-type to typical mammalian complextype N-glycans, the recombinant human glycosyltransferases, MGAT1ΔTM, MGAT2ΔTM and
GalTΔTM, were effectively combined in a cell-free, one-pot glycosylation reaction. The gene
expression of these glycosyltransferases in E. coli and the activity of the His-tag purified,
soluble recombinant proteins in one-pot reactions using free glycans as substrates has been
shown before ((Fujiyama et al., 2001), Mahour et al., unpublished).

The site-specific glycan analysis of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomain
expressed in human-derived cell line FreeStyle™ 293-F showed that of the 22 N-glycosylation
sites only eight contained substantial fractions of oligomannose-type N-glycans (Watanabe et
al., 2020). It is assumed that the occurrence of oligomannose-type fractions is caused by the
steric inaccessibility of these glycans to the glycan processing enzymes in the Golgi, i.e. the
occurrence of oligomannose-type N-glycans at distinct sites has shown to be independent of the
producer cell line for the HIV viral glycoprotein gp120 (Pritchard et al., 2015). In accordance
with the human cell-derived spike protein, our engineered spike protein abundantly exhibited
complex-type G2F N-glycans. To a minor extend, a range of hybrid- and oligomannose-type
N-glycans were also detected on the engineered spike protein. In contrast to the engineered
spike protein, human cell-derived spike proteins also exhibit complex-type multi-antennary and
sialylated structures (Watanabe et al., 2020). Taken together, a significant overlap of the
glycoform has been generated. Whether the overlap is also site-specific remains to be
investigated in future.

Over the past years, many efforts have been made to engineer insect cell lines to express
complex-type N-glycans. A comprehensive summary of the attempts is given by Palomares et
al. (Palomares et al.). Briefly, complex-type N-glycans can be produced by the co-expression
of glycosyltransferases or by generating transient insect cell lines. While the former generates
an additional metabolic burden and affects growth properties, the stability of the latter has not
been examined for commercial scale use. The advantage of in-vitro glycoengineering lies in its
independence of producer cell lines as well as its flexibility towards the option to readily
generate different glycoforms that are close to homogeneity. However, expensive nucleotides
sugars are required as substrates and, thus, it is so far not feasible to apply in-vitro
glycoengineering at larger scales (Mahour et al., 2018;Rexer et al., 2018;Rexer et al., 2020b).

SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein variants produced in a baculovirus-insect cell expression
system were in-vitro glycoengineered using recombinant glycosyltransferases to mimic the
glycoform observed on the human cell-derived protein. In-vitro glycoengineering reactions as
conducted here, can be used to generate immunogen candidates for pre-clinical testing to
investigate the role of glycosylation on the antigenicity and immunogenicity in animal models.
In general, in-vitro glycoengineering approaches can virtually be used to tailor the glycoform
of all prominent vaccine candidates such as activated and attenuated viruses and virus like
particles. The application of the technology to larger scales depends on the bulk availability of
sugar nucleotides at moderate costs.

List of Figures

Figure 1. A) In-vivo the oligomannose-type N-glycan Man5 is converted into complex-type Nglycans by mannosidases and MGAT1, MGAT2 and GalT. Substrates for these reactions are
UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-galactose, respectively. B) This process can be remodelled in-vitro to
synthesize complex-type structures on insect cell-derived recombinant proteins with
paucimannose-type N-glycans, like Man3.
