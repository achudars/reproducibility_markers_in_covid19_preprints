Abstract:
The SARS-CoV-2 viral genome mutates incessantly as it spreads in the world and the gene for
the Spike (S) protein, critical for viral transmission into humans, is no exception. Analysis of
4,517 variants isolated from humans identified regions with few mutations, thus pinpointing
important functional and structural sites in the S protein. This information can guide the
development of effective prophylactic agents to arrest the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Main text
To curb the COVID-19 pandemic, prophylaxis development has focused on preventing
entry of the virus by inhibiting the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with its human receptor,
angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)1. The S protein on the virus is responsible for the
interaction with ACE2. Proteases cleave the S protein into S1 and S2 subunits, to enable viral
binding to ACE22 and viral entry by membrane fusion3. S1 contains the receptor binding domain
(RBD) in either the ‘open’ (active) or ‘closed’ (inactive) conformations4,5,6 (Supplementary Fig.
1a). Four types of prophylaxis strategies have been employed: 1. Preventing S1 protein
proteolysis7; 2. Competing with S1 binding to ACE2, using S1 or ACE2 protein fragments or
peptides1; 3. Generating monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S protein or
RBD, to be used as passive vaccines8; or 4. Active vaccines, generating an immune response,
usually to the S protein, in humans at risk for exposure9,10,11. In addition to the RBD, regions
such as the trimer interface of S, furin proteolysis sites, glycosylation sites and linoleic acid
(LA)-binding site are likely important for maintaining structural integrity, entry, and
transmission of the virus and therefore are expected to be more conserved relative to other
regions.
To identify areas in the S protein that are the least divergent as the virus evolves in
humans, we used an online database12, that as of November 11, included 189,704 individual

virus sequences isolated throughout the world. As compared with Wuhan (EPI_ISL_402124)
sequence of February 202013, the 1,273 amino acid S protein5 had 4,517 variants, excluding inframe insertions. On average, each position in the protein sequence has approximately 4 variants
(Fig. 1a). However, some regions harbor 10 variants per amino acid position whereas others have
no variants (Figs. 1a; Supplementary Figs. 1b,c).
Regions in S protein with no more than 2 variants/position are more prevalent in the
structurally critical trimer interface (38% of the amino acids; Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1b,c),
the RBD (37%, Fig. 1) and the small LA-binding site (65%; Fig. 2a,b). The trimer interface is
less accessible and therefore unlikely to be druggable, but the LA pocket could be a potential
target for therapeutics with small molecules that stabilizes the S protein in closed/inactive
conformation; the fatty acid-binding pocket in the inactive conformation of S protein is
conserved in other coronaviruses6 and 82% of the variants among the 20 amino acids that make
this pocket are predicted to have a neutral effect (Extended Data Table 1).
Much of the therapeutic efforts are focused on the RBD (amino acids 331-524). The RBD
contains ten invariant amino acids (Fig. 1c-e) and only 7% of the RBD variants are predicted by
PROVEAN software14 to be structurally or functionally damaging (Extended Data Table 1).
Therefore, drugs targeting the RBD are expected to be effective prophylactics to most SARSCoV-2 variants. We computationally determined the change in affinity of each variant relative to
the Wuhan variant. Of the amino acids that are within 4.5 Å of ACE2, 26 residues had 81
different variants; 29 variants had calculated increased affinity, of which 7 had >1kcal/mol
increased affinity (Extended Data Table 2). (We calculated the impact of one variant at a time,
noting that combinations of variants may have different effects on RBD/ACE2 affinity.) Whether
these potential changes in affinity result in altered fitness of the virus for infectivity remains to
be determined.
We also identified another so called ‘hot’ or less variable region between residues 541-

612 (Figs. 1a, 2c-e). This invariable region is relatively hydrophobic, yet a substantial number of
residues remain exposed in the open and closed conformations (Supplemental Fig. 1d). Very
recently, Q564 within this region has been proposed to act as a ‘latch’, stabilizing the closed
conformation of S15. We suggest that this hydrophobic domain may participate in membrane
fusion. Determining the role of this invariable region is important, as it may be another Achilles
heel to target for anti SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
We next examined other regions in the S protein for which functions have been assigned.
Furin proteolysis at the S1-S2 boundary (681-685) and in S2 (811-815) exposes the RBD to
enable ACE2 binding, and the S2 – to initiate membrane fusion2. Yet both the consensus sites
and the critical arginine are not conserved (Fig. 2f), in agreement with a prior analysis of furin
site 116. This supports the reports that other proteases may contribute to S protein maturation17.
Therefore, drugs that focus on inhibiting furin specifically or any single protease may not be
effective preventive treatment against all SARS-CoV-2 variants.
The S protein has also 66 glycosylation sites in each trimer, which facilitate protein
folding and may lead to host immune system evasion18. Surprisingly, none of the asparagine
residues serving as a glycosylation site are conserved, suggesting that not all the glycosylation
sites are essential (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b).
Interaction between NRP1 and S protein was proposed to regulate SARS-CoV-2
transmission19. However, this interaction site in S1 is not conserved (Supplementary Fig. 2c);
73% of positions had more than 2 variants. Although all the variants are predicted to have a
neutral effect (Extended Data Table 1), this may not be a good target for prophylactic treatment
against all SARS-CoV-2 variants.
Our analysis of the frequency of variants throughout the S protein of SARS-CoV-2
identified regions of high and low divergence, which may aid in developing effective
prophylactic treatments. In this analysis of mutations in S, we did not consider the frequency of a

particular mutation nor in how many countries the mutation was found. Such analysis, as was
done for D614G20, may further aid in determining the potential fitness acquired by a particular
mutation. Our data suggest that it may be beneficial to develop passive and active vaccines that
target the RBD, instead of the entire S protein, as well as small molecules that lock the closed
conformation, such as those mimicking the LA. However, considering the high rate of mutation
throughout the S protein, resistance to treatment with monoclonal antibodies is likely to occur.
Finally, drugs and antibodies targeting region 541-612, a relatively conserved and exposed
region on the protein’s surface, may also have prophylactic benefit.
