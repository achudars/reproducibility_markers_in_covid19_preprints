Abstract
Anosmia is one of the most prevalent symptoms of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection during the COVID‐
19 pandemic. However, the cellular mechanism behind the sudden loss of smell has not yet
been investigated. The initial step of odour detection takes place in the pseudostratified
olfactory epithelium (OE) mainly composed of olfactory sensory neurons surrounded by
supporting cells known as sustentacular cells. The olfactory neurons project their axons to
the olfactory bulb in the central nervous system offering a potential pathway for pathogens
to enter the central nervous system by bypassing the blood brain barrier. In the present
study, we explored the impact of SARS‐COV‐2 infection on the olfactory system in golden
Syrian hamsters. We observed massive damage of the OE as early as 2 days post nasal
instillation of SARS‐CoV‐2, resulting in a major loss of cilia necessary for odour detection. These
damages were associated with infection of a large proportion of sustentacular cells but not
of olfactory neurons, and we did not detect any presence of the virus in the olfactory bulbs.
We observed massive infiltration of immune cells in the OE and lamina propria of infected
animals, which may contribute to the desquamation of the OE. The OE was partially restored
14 days post infection. Anosmia observed in COVID‐19 patient is therefore likely to be linked
to a massive and fast desquamation of the OE following sustentacular cells infection with
SARS‐CoV‐2 and subsequent recruitment of immune cells in the OE and lamina propria.

1. Introduction
Respiratory viruses are very common worldwide and impact human and animal health with
important economic consequences. Although most symptoms of respiratory virus infection
are related to airway inflammation and focused on the respiratory tract, extra respiratory
organs are also targeted by these viruses including the central nervous system (Bohmwald et
al., 2018). The recent pandemic of coronavirus disease emerging in December 2019 (COVID‐
19) has been accompanied by a prevalence of olfaction alteration. Indeed, approximately
60% of patients infected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐
2) that is the cause of COVID‐19 suffered from mild (hyposmia) to total loss of olfactory
capacities (anosmia) (Spinato et al., 2020). The origin of these alterations remains to be
established.
Olfaction starts with olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) located in the olfactory epithelium
(OE) present in the most dorsal part of the nasal cavity. The OE along with the underlying
lamina propria constitutes the olfactory mucosa. OSNs have cilia in direct contact with the
environment in order to detect odorants. They are therefore accessible to respiratory
viruses and some of these viruses are able to infect the OSN and reach the central nervous
system by following the olfactory nerves which project to the olfactory bulbs (Forrester et
al., 2018; Bryche et al., 2019a). Interestingly, SARS‐CoV‐1 (Netland et al., 2008) was
described as a virus able to use this olfactory pathway.
ACE2 (angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2) was characterized as the main entrance receptor
for SARS‐CoV‐2 (Letko et al., 2020), similarly to SARS‐CoV‐1. SARS‐CoV‐1 was described as
being able to enter the central nervous system in mice transgenic for human ACE2 (Netland
et al., 2008). In this model, the brain infection starts from the olfactory bulbs and while the

authors did not look for a potential infection of the olfactory mucosa, it may be that SARS‐
CoV‐1 could infect olfactory sensory neurons, reaching the brain through the olfactory bulbs
where these neurons project (Forrester et al., 2018). If SARS‐COV‐2 infection follows the
same pathway, anosmia following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection may correlate with the
encephalopathies observed in some COVID‐19 patients (Roe, 2020) and further highlights
the need to unravel the cellular basis of the observed anosmia.
Golden Syrian hamsters have been successfully used as a model of SARS‐CoV‐1 infection
(Roberts et al., 2005) and have also been recently shown to be a good model for SARS‐CoV‐2
as well (Sia et al., 2020). Indeed, the expression profile of ACE2, the entry receptor for SARS‐
CoV‐2, is very similar in hamsters and humans (Luan et al., 2020). Anosmia in COVID‐19
patients provided impetus to study the expression profile of ACE2 in the nasal cavity. Several
studies show that ACE2 is present in the OE but expressed in sustentacular cells, the
supporting cells surrounding the olfactory neurons, rather than in the olfactory neurons
themselves (Bilinska et al., 2020; Fodoulian et al., 2020). However, a recent study suggested
that SARS‐CoV‐2 could infect olfactory sensory neurons in hamsters (Sia et al., 2020).
In the present work, we focused on the pathological impact of two different SARS‐CoV‐2
strains on the nasal cavity and the central nervous system of the golden Syrian hamster.

2. Material and methods
2.1 Isolates of SARS‐CoV‐2
Viral strains were isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs obtained from patients suffering from
respiratory infection, suspected of COVID‐19 and submitted to molecular diagnosis.
Nasopharyngeal flocked swabs were suspended in UTM media (Copan, Italy), and kept at 4°C
for less than 48 hours. A volume of 400 µl was homogenized and microfiltered (0.5 µm)
previous to inoculation on Vero cells CCL‐81 (passage 32, from ATCC, USA) grown at 80%
confluence in a BSL3 virology laboratory (Virology Unit, CHU de Caen, France). Supernatants
were harvested at day 3 after inoculation and immediately used in subsequent passage one
(P1) of the virus following the same protocol. P1 was used for stock production and each
stock was aliquoted and conserved at ‐80°C before titration and genomic quantification. Two
strains were used in the model : UCN1 and UCN19, isolated at one week interval during the
course of the active epidemic in Normandy, France (end of march).
2.2 Animals
Animal experiments were carried out in the animal‐biosafety level 3 (A‐BSL3) facility of the
Animal Experimental Platform (ANSES – laboratoire de Lyon). The protocol for animal use
was approved by the French Ministère de la Recherche et de l’Enseignement Supérieur
number (Apafis n°24818‐2020032710416319). Twelve female golden Syrian hamsters (eight
weeks old) were purchased from Janvier’s breeding Centre (Le Genest, St Isle, France).
Infection was done by nasal instillation (20µl in each nostril) of anaesthetised animals
(Vetflurane). Five animals were infected with 5.4 103 plaque forming units (pfu) of SARS‐
CoV2 strain UCN1, five animals were infected with 1.8 103 pfu of SARS‐CoV2 strain UCN19
and two mock‐infected animals received only Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium

(DMEM). SARS‐CoV2‐infected hamsters were euthanized after general anaesthesia
(Vetflurane) at 2, 4, 7, 10 or 14 days after infection. At post‐mortem, lungs were harvested,
weighed and homogenized in 1 ml of DMEM with stainless steel beads (QIAGEN) for 30s at
30 Hz using TissueLyserII (QIAGEN). Lung homogenates were clarified by centrifugation
(2,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min), aliquoted and stored at −80°C until RNA extraction. RNA
extraction was done with QIAamp Viral RNA minikit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s
instructions. Real time quantitative PCR was performed on the E gene as described recently
(Corman et al., 2020) on a Lightcycler LC480 (Roche).
2.3 Immunohistochemistry, histological stainings and quantifications
The immunohistochemistry analysis of the olfactory mucosa tissue sections was performed
as described previously in mice (Bryche et al., 2019a). Briefly, the whole animal head was
fixed for 3 days at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde PBS, then decalcified for one
week (10% EDTA – pH 7.3 at 4°C). The nasal septum and endoturbinates were removed as a
block and post‐fixed overnight at 4°C in 4% paraformaldehyde PBS and further decalcified
for 3 days. The same procedure was applied with cortex and brainstem but without
decalcification. Blocks and tissues were cryoprotected with sucrose (30%). Cryo‐sectioning
(14 μm) was performed on median transversal sections of the nasal cavity, perpendicular to
the hard palate, in order to highlight vomeronasal organ, olfactory mucosa, Steno’s gland
and olfactory bulb. The brain was cryo‐sectioned (14 µm) in the coronal plane. Sections were
stored at ‐80°C until use. Non‐specific staining was blocked by incubation in 2% bovine
serum albumin and 0.3% Triton X‐100. The sections were then incubated overnight with
primary antibodies directed against SARS Nucleocapsid Protein (1:200; rabbit polyclonal,
NB100‐56576, NOVUS, France); olfactory marker protein ‐ OMP (1:500; goat polyclonal; 544‐
10001, WAKO, USA), cytokeratin‐18 ‐ CK18 (1:50; mouse polyclonal; MAB3234 – RGE53,

polyclonal; ab178846, Abcam, France); G alpha s/olf ‐ Golf (1:500; rabbit polyclonal; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (sc383), Dallas, TX, USA). Fluorescence staining was performed using
goat anti‐rabbit Alexa‐Fluor‐488 (1:1000; Molecular Probes – A32731; Invitrogen, Cergy
Pontoise, France), donkey anti‐goat Alexa‐Fluor‐555 (1:1000; Molecular Probes A32816;
Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) and donkey anti‐mouse Alexa‐Fluor 555 (1:500;
Molecular Probes – A32773; Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) secondary antibodies.
Images were taken at x100 magnification using an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope
equipped with an Orca ER Hamamatsu cooled CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics France,
Massy, France) or with a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal 187 microscope (MIMA2 Platform, INRAe).
Images were quantified using ImageJ (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, U. S. National Institutes of
Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/, 1997–2012) to threshold specific
staining.
For histology, some sections were rehydrated then stained in hematoxylin (H‐3404 Vector
Laboratories) for 30s and washed with water. Slides were then transferred in an acid‐alcohol
solution (0.5% HCl in 70% Ethanol) for 10s and washed in water, then immersed in eosin
(Sigma HT110316) for 15s and washed again in water. Finally, slides were gradually
dehydrated and mounted in Eukitt (Sigma 25608–33‐7). Nissl staining was performed on
some sections following conventional histological procedures, including immersion in 0.1%
cresyl violet solution for 10 minutes. Images were taken at x100 magnification using a DMBR
Leica microscope equipped with an Olympus DP‐50 CCD camera using CellF software
(Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions GmbH, OSIS, Munster, Germany).

We measured the OE thickness, the OSN cilia quality (based on Golf staining) and the
immune cell infiltration of the olfactory mucosa (based on the Iba1 staining) on 6 images per
animal taken from 3 different slides spread along the nasal cavity. For the OE thickness, 10
measurements along the OE septum were performed for each image, as previously
described (Francois et al., 2016). The percentage of apical OE with a preserved Golf staining
and the percentage of Iba1+ cells infiltration in the OE were measured using ImageJ to
threshold specific staining. All values were averaged per animal.
We also globally estimated the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 on the OE on these parameters. By
comparing mock‐infected animals with SARS‐CoV‐2 infected animals, we evaluated: 1the
integrity of the structure of the OE using HE staining; 2the preservation of the OSN cilia using
Golf signal in the apical part of the OE; 3the presence and shape of Iba1+ cells in the OE and in
the underneath lamina propria. A ramified Iba1+ cells is considered representative of a
resting state while an amoeboid shape is linked to an activated state in the OE (Mori et al.,
2002). For each parameter, we used a scale ranging from 0 to 10 scored on three sections of
the olfactory mucosa spread along the nasal cavity per animal. This evaluation was
performed by three experienced investigators blinded to the animal treatment. Scores were
averaged per animal between investigators.

3. Results
3.1 SARS‐CoV‐2 induces massive damage in the olfactory epithelium
We used a cohort of 12 hamsters to examine the impact of two different isolates of SARS‐
CoV‐2 (UCN1 and UCN19) on the nasal cavity from 2 to 14 day post infection (DPI) through
nasal instillation. While the olfactory epithelium was well preserved in control animals, we
observed massive damage of the olfactory epithelium in SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected animals as

early as 2 DPI (Fig. 1A). The nasal cavity lumen was filled with cellular aggregates and most
of the olfactory epithelium was strongly disorganized. In the most affected OE zones, axon
bundles from the olfactory sensory neurons under the olfactory epithelium were almost in
direct contact with the environment (Fig. 1B). As an objective measure of olfactory mucosa
damage, we first measured the septal olfactory epithelium thickness (Fig. 1C) and we then
scored the overall lesions of the OE (Fig. 1D). Most of the OE had disappeared at 4 DPI, after
which point it started to recover but had not reached pre‐infection thickness at 14 DPI when
our measurements stopped. The results were similar for both viruses.

(n=2).

3.2 SARS‐CoV‐2 infects mainly sustentacular cells and not olfactory sensory neurons
in the OE
We then examined the cellular localisation of SARS‐CoV‐2 in the nasal cavity by
immunohistochemistry, using an antibody raised against the nucleocapsid protein of the
virus. We observed that a large proportion of the OE was infected at 2 DPI, which decreased
at 4 DPI and subsequently disappeared (Fig. 2A and Supp. Fig. 1A, B). The virus was also
present in the vomeronasal organ (Supp. Fig. 2A) and in the Steno’s gland (Supp. Fig. 2B) at
2 DPI and 4 DPI. We also examined various areas of the brain. We could not find any
presence of the virus in the olfactory bulbs (Supp. Fig. 3A), in the olfactory cortex (piriform
cortex and olfactory tubercle), hypothalamus, hippocampus, and in the brainstem where we
mainly focused on the respiratory control centres: the ventral respiratory column and the
nucleus of the solitary tract (Supp. Fig. 3B). The virus presence in the nasal cavity followed a
kinetic similar to its presence in the lungs (Supp. Fig. 1C).
In order to identify which cells were infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 in the OE, we performed
double staining of the olfactory mucosa with OMP and CK18, specific markers of mature
OSNs and sustentacular cells respectively. While most of the cells infected with SARS‐CoV2
expressed CK18 as well, we were not able to find any viral antigen in OMP expressing cells.
These results show that SARS‐CoV‐2 infects sustentacular cells but not OSNs (Fig. 2).
Interestingly, we observed staining of OMP, CK18, SARS‐CoV‐2 as well as Hoechst in the
lumen of the nasal cavity indicating that part of the OE containing infected and non‐infected
cells was desquamated in response to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

3.3 OSNs lost most of their cilia as early as 2 DPI with SARS‐CoV‐2
In order to understand the extent of the damage of the OSNs following SARS‐CoV‐2
infection, we examined the preservation of the OSN cilia layer, which contains all the
transduction complex allowing the detection of odours (Dibattista et al., 2017). We
performed immunohistochemistry against Golf (Fig. 3A, B), a specific G protein from this
complex (Jones and Reed, 1989). We quantified the percentage of septal olfactory
epithelium containing Golf staining in the apical part of the OE (Fig. 3C) and scored globally
the quantity of Golf staining in the OE (Fig. 3D). While the Golf signal was completely
preserved in control animals, it quickly diminished in SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected animals without
any clear improvement from 2 DPI to 10 DPI. We observed a small recovery of the Golf signal
only in the septal part of the OE 14 DPI with the UCN19 virus.

3.4 Infiltration of immune cells in the olfactory epithelium following SARS‐CoV‐2
intranasal instillation
We finally examined the presence of immune cells in the olfactory mucosa using Iba1+ as a
specific marker of monocyte/macrophage lineage (Bryche et al., 2019b); (Fig. 4A). In control
animals, Iba1+ cells were mainly localized in the lamina propria and exhibited a ramified
morphology with many processes (Fig. 4B), which is typical of a resting phenotype (Mori et
al., 2002). We measured the presence of Iba1+ cell (Fig. 4C) and scored the presence and
shape of Iba1+ cells in the OE and the lamina propria separately (Fig. 4D). While Iba1+ cells
were mostly absent from the OE and moderately present in the lamina propria in control
animals, their presence was drastically increased up to 4 DPI in infected animals, both in the
OE and the lamina propria (Fig. 4A, B). Furthermore, Iba1+ cells were mostly of amoeboid
shape which is typical of an activated state at 2 to 7 DPI (Fig. 4B). We also observed Iba1+
cells in the lumen of the nasal cavity in the cellular aggregates containing SARS‐CoV‐2 (Fig.
4A). Immune cell infiltration gradually diminished. This reduction was first observed at 10
DPI in the OE but was not seen in the lamina propria before 14 DPI. At 14 DPI, it reached the
mock level both in the OE and the lamina propria for both virus strains (Fig. 4C, D).

4. Discussion
In the present study, we focused on the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 in the nasal cavity and central
nervous system using the golden Syrian hamster as a model. We chose to work with 2
different isolates of SARS‐CoV‐2, with the potential to obtain slightly different strain
behaviour. We explored the kinetic of the impact of these two different isolates. Due to the
difficulty of designing experiments during the COVID‐19 pandemic, we examined only one
animal per virus strain and per time point. Overall, our results are globally consistent for
both viruses and the kinetics of the different measured parameters were always following
consistent evolution from 2 DPI to 14 DPI. While these results require confirmation with
larger animal groups, they provide a qualitative overview of the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 on the
nasal cavity which could explain the anosmia observed in COVID‐19 patients. Indeed,
according to our results, sustentacular cells are rapidly infected by SARS‐CoV‐2 and this
infection is associated with a massive recruitment of immune cells in the OE and lamina
propria, which could induce a rapid disorganization of the OE structure by causing
immunopathology. This hypothesis is consistent with elevated level of TNFα observed in OE
samples from COVID‐19 suffering patients (Torabi et al., 2020). This disorganization is
followed by a massive destruction of the OE which is released in the lumen of the nasal

cavity, taking away most of the cilia layer of the OSNs. In the absence of these cilia, the
olfactory transduction is not functional and thus the olfactory capacity of the animals should
be impaired until the OE regenerates. At 14 DPI, the thickness of the OE is already recovering
to approximatively 50% of the mock condition and some functional cilia reappear. Such
kinetics is consistent with the observed recovery of anosmia in COVID‐19 patients. Indeed,
recent studies highlight a relatively fast recovery (~15 days) (Dell'Era et al., 2020; Meini et
al., 2020), compatible with the observed partial recovery of the OE in hamsters 14 DPI.
We identify sustentacular cells as the main target cells of SARS‐CoV‐2 in the OE. This
observation is consistent with the expression pattern of ACE2 mainly present in these cells
along with the facilitating protease TMPRSS2 (Bilinska et al., 2020; Fodoulian et al., 2020).
Two recent reports indicate that olfactory neurons in hamster (Sia et al., 2020) and
respiratory cells in ferret (Ryan et al., 2020) may be the target of SARS‐CoV‐2 but these
studies did not focus on the nasal cavity and they did not use double staining to clearly
identify the infected cells in the OE. We observed that SARS‐CoV‐2 can infect other non‐
neuronal cells in the nasal cavity, notably in the epithelium covering the lumen of Steno’s
gland which is however poorly described in the literature (Bryche et al., 2019b). Further
studies are required to clearly identify the other non‐neuronal cells infected by SARS‐CoV‐2
in the nasal cavity which may facilitate the systemic infection of other cell types and tissues
lower in the respiratory airways.
We did not observe any presence of the virus in the brain, notably in the olfactory bulbs
where OSNs projects and in the piriform cortex where the olfactory signal is integrated. We
also focused on the hypothalamus which contains ACE2 expressing neurons (Mukerjee et al.,
2019) as well as on the respiratory centres of the brainstem as the latter are suspected to be

infected in COVID‐19 patients suffering from heavy respiratory disorders (Gandhi et al.,
2020). Our lack of virus detection in the central nervous system may be due to the low
number of animal examined but, nevertheless, we can rule out a systematic and important
infection of the brain following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in hamster. This is consistent with a
recent review of the literature which failed to indicate any central nervous manifestation of
SARS‐CoV‐2 presence in human central nervous system (Romoli et al., 2020), however the
neurotropic ability of SARS‐CoV‐2 remains controversial (Wang et al., 2020). Interestingly,
SARS‐CoV‐1 has been shown to be neurotropic only using ACE2 humanized mice. The OSNs
of these mice must also express ACE2 as it is under the control of K18 ubiquitous promoter
(Netland et al., 2008). SARS‐CoV‐1 may thus infect OSNs expressing ectopic ACE2 and the
observation of presence of the virus in the brain may not be relevant for a more
physiological model. In our model, we observed a fast desquamation of the OE following
SARS‐CoV‐2 infection of sustentacular cells. Further studies are required to decipher
whether it could be an anti‐viral strategy to limit access of the virus to the brain through the
olfactory pathway and to which extent the recruitment of immune cells contributes to this
process through immunopathological mechanisms.
Globally, we present here the first data focusing on the impact of the SARS‐CoV‐2 in the
nasal cavity. Our results could explain the high prevalence of anosmia observed in COVID‐19
patients and will need to be confirmed by analysis of human OE.
