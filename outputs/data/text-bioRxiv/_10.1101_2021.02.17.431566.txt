Abstract: The pandemic of the COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has led to more than
100 million infections and over 2 million deaths worldwide. The progress in the developments of
effective vaccines and neutralizing antibody therapeutics brings hopes to eliminate the threat of
COVID-19. However, SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate, and several new variants have been
emerged. Among the various naturally-occurring mutations, the E484K mutation shared by both the
501Y.V2 and 501Y.V3 variants attracted serious concerns, which may potentially enhance the
receptor binding affinity and reduce the immune response. In the present study, the molecular
mechanism behind the impacts of E484K mutation on the binding affinity of the receptor-binding
domain (RBD) with the receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) was
investigated by using the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with the molecular
mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MMGBSA) method. Our results indicate that the E484K
mutation results in more favorable electrostatic interactions compensating the burial of the charged
and polar groups upon the binding of RBD with hACE2, which significantly improves the RBDhACE2 binding affinity. Besides that, the E484K mutation also causes the conformational
rearrangements of the loop region containing the mutant residue, which leads to more tight binding
interface of RBD with hACE2 and formation of some new hydrogen bonds. The more tight binding
interface and the new hydrogen bonds formation also contribute to the improved binding affinity of
RBD to the receptor hACE2. In addition, six neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies complexed
with RBD were selected to explore the effects of E484K mutation on the recognition of these
antibodies to RBD. The simulation results show that the E484K mutation significantly reduces the
binding affinities to RBD for most of the studied neutralizing antibodies, and the decrease in the
binding affinities is mainly owing to the unfavorable electrostatic interactions caused by the
mutation. Our studies revealed that the E484K mutation may improve the binding affinity between
RBD and the receptor hACE2, implying more transmissibility of the E484K-containing variants,
and weaken the binding affinities between RBD and the studied neutralizing antibodies, indicating
reduced effectiveness of these antibodies. Our results provide valuable information for the effective
vaccine development and antibody drugs design.

INTRODUCTION
SARS-CoV-2 that causes the COVID-19 disease with high morbidity and mortality has spread
rapidly across the world. According to the reports of the World Health Organization (WHO), SARS1

CoV-2 has led to 93,194,922 infection cases and 2,014,729 deaths until 17 January 2021[1], which
poses great threats to public health and brings heavy burdens to global economy. The significant
progress in the developments of COVID-19 vaccines[2,3], including inactivated vaccine[4], mRNA
vaccine[5,6], live vectorial vaccine[7,8] and recombinant protein subunit vaccine[9,10], as well as
the neutralizing antibody therapeutics [11,12] is encouraging to prevent the pandemic of SARSCoV-2. However, the virus is in constant evolution and several more contagious variants have
emerged[13-16]. It is important to investigate the molecular mechanism for the impacts of the
naturally occurring mutations on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, as well as on the immune
effectiveness of the vaccines and the efficacy of the neutralizing antibodies.
It has been revealed that SARS-CoV-2 uses the spike (S) protein protruding on the surface of
the virus membrane to bind to the receptor, i.e., human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2),
on the host cells[17]. S is a homo-trimeric glycoprotein and each protomer is composed of S1 and
S2 subunits. To recognize and bind with hACE2, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1
undergoes a “down” to “up” conformational transition to expose the receptor-binding motif (RBM),
which is directly involved in the interactions with the host cell receptor. Receptor binding triggers
the dissociation of the S1 subunit and the transition of the S2 subunit from the prefusion to the
postfusion states, which then leads to the membrane fusion and the invasion of the virus to the host
cells[18]. Due to its critical function during the infection process, RBD predominantly determines
the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2[19,20]. In addition, many studies have indicated that the S protein,
especially the RBD, contains the major neutralizing epitopes, and the RBD-targeting antibodies
immunodominantly contribute to the neutralizing activity of the convalescent sera from SARSCoV-2 infected patients[21-23].
SARS-CoV-2 evolves continuously, and several new variants have already appeared and spread
rapidly in many countries. On November 2020, a SARS-CoV-2 variant, termed as lineage B.1.1.7
or 501Y.V1, was detected in England, which rapidly became the dominant epidemic strain and
spread to more than 30 countries[14,24,25]. Another new variant, named lineage B.1.351 or
501Y.V2, was discovered in South Africa on December 2020, which caused a new wave of SARSCoV-2 infections and replaced other coronavirus strains to be one of the most pandemic[15]. In
January 2021, a new variant named P.1 or 501Y.V3 was found in the travelers from Brazil, which
has been widely prevalent in Amazonas state of north Brazil and has spread to Faroe Islands, South
Korea and the United states[16,26]. Compared with the original SARS-CoV-2 strains, the 501Y.V1,
501Y.V2 and 501Y.V3 variants are potentially more transmissible, which may also reduce the
effectiveness of the current vaccines and neutralizing antibodies[27]. The outbreaks of these new
arising strains have attracted serious concerns globally. In these new epidemic strains, several
residue mutations occur in the RBM of the S protein, which are directly involved in the interactions
with the receptor hACE2 as well as with some immunodominant neutralizing antibodies. The
501Y.V1 strain carries the N501Y mutation in the RBM of the S protein. Experimental and
simulation studies have revealed that the N501Y mutation improves the binding affinity of RBD to
the receptor hACE2, which is believed to account for the more transmissibility of the 501Y.V1
variant than the original strains[28-32]. Fortunately, the sera neutralization assay showed that the
N501Y mutation has little effect on the neutralization of the human sera elicited by the BNT162b2
mRNA vaccine[25]. In the 501Y.V2 and 501Y.V3 variants, besides the N501Y mutation, two other
mutations E484K and K417N (or K417T) were occurred in RBD of the S protein, and it is revealed
that the E484K mutation obviously enhances the binding affinity between RBD and hACE2[33].

More importantly, growing evidences indicated that the E484K mutation shared by both the
501Y.V2 and 501Y.V3 variants, named “escape mutation”, distinctly reduces the neutralization
activity and even may escape from the neutralizing antibodies in the convalescent plasma of
COVID-19 patients, which may weaken the effectiveness of the vaccines and the efficacy of the
neutralizing antibody therapeutics in developments[21,31,34-36]. Understanding the molecular
mechanism behind the effects of the E484K mutation on the RBD-hACE2 interactions as well as
on the effectiveness of the neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies targeted at the wild-type RBD is
of great significance for the developments of the therapeutic antibodies and vaccine designs.
In the present work, all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation combined with the
molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MMGBSA) method[37,38] was employed to
investigate the impacts of E484K mutation on the binding affinities of RBD with the receptor
hACE2 as well as with the neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies. Our calculation results show
that the E484K mutation may improve the binding affinity of RBD to the receptor hACE2 owing to
more favorable electrostatic forces and more tight binding interface caused by the mutation, which
implies more transmissibility of the E484K-containing variants. In addition, for most of the studied
neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies, the E484K mutation leads to reduced binding affinities
between RBD and these antibodies mainly due to the mutation-caused disadvantage electrostatic
interactions, which weakens the effectiveness of these antibodies and even evade the immune
protect.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein structures preparation
The atomic coordinates file of the wild-type RBD complexed with the receptor hACE2 was
downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the accession code 6M0J[17]. The structures
of the complex formed by the wild-type RBD and various neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies
were also obtained from PDB with accession codes listed in Table 1. To investigate the impacts of
the E484K mutation on the binding affinity of RBD with hACE2 and the neutralizing antibodies,
the residue Glu484 was replaced with Lys in these complex structures by using the UCSF chimera
software to construct the corresponding mutant structures, in which the sidechain conformation of
the mutated residue was chose as the rotamer with the highest probability according to the Dunbrack
2010 library[39].

receptor hACE2 as well as with the neutralizing antibodies were subjected to all-atomic MD
simulations. In order to verify the convergence of our simulation and calculation results, a total of
5 independent MD simulations were carried out for each studied system. All the simulations were
performed by using Amber16 software with the ff14SB fore field[46,47]. The input files for MD
simulations were prepared with LEAP module of AmberTools16. After structure preparation, the
simulation system was solvated in a cubic box with TIP3P water molecules and the size of the box
was set to ensure that all protein atoms were at least 1.0 nm away from the box edges. The counter
ions Na+ or Cl- were added into the water box to neutralize the net charges of the system. Then, the
energy of the system was minimized in two stages. In the first stage, the protein atoms were fixed
by position restraints with a harmonic force constant of 10 kcal/(molÅ2), and only the water
molecules as well as the counter-ions were energy minimized with 10000 steps of steepest descent
algorithm followed by 10000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization algorithm. In the second
stage, the entire system was energy minimized without any position restraints by using 10000 cycles
of steepest descent algorithm combined with 10000 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization. After
energy minimization, a 200ps constant volume (NTV ensemble) MD simulation with position
restraints of 10 kcal/(molÅ2) on protein atoms was performed, in which the system was gradually
heated to the temperature of 300 K. Subsequently, a 1 ns isothermal-isobaric (NTP ensemble)
equilibration simulation at 300 K was carried out, in which the position restraints on protein
structure were gradually released. In the equilibration simulation, the position restraints were
gradually removed in five steps with the harmonic forces of 10.0, 5.0, 1.0, 0.5 and 0.25 kcal/(molÅ2),
respectively, and each equilibration step was performed for 200 ps. Finally, the production NTP MD
simulation without position restraints was performed for 6ns to obtain the simulation trajectory. For
each studied system, the production NTP simulations were independently repeated five times. In
these NTP MD simulations, the temperature of the system was kept at 300K with the Langevin
coupling algorithm, and the pressure of the system was kept at 1 atm with Berendsen method. The
cutoff value for the non-bonded van der Waals and short-range electrostatic interactions was set to
10 Å. All hydrogen bonds were constrained with the SHAKE algorithm and the integration time
step for the simulations was set to 2 fs.
Molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MMGBSA) calculations
Based on the simulation trajectories, the binding free energy of RBD with the receptor hACE2 as
well as with the various neutralizing antibodies was calculated by using the MMGBSA method. For
each complex system, five binding free energy values were computed based on the five independent
MD simulation trajectories to validate the convergence of our computation results. To investigate
the impacts of the E484K mutation on the binding affinities of these complexes, the same MMGBSA
calculations were carried out both for the systems formed by the wild-type RBD and the
corresponding mutant systems formed by the RBD with the E484K mutation. According to the
calculation results of the wild-type complexes and the corresponding mutants, the influences of the
E484K mutation on the binding affinities of RBD with the receptor hACE2 as well as with the
neutralizing antibodies were evaluated.
The MMGBSA calculations were carried out by using the Amber16 software with the singletrajectory method. In MMGBSA method, the binding free energy was estimated by summing the
following contributions: ∆𝐺𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑑 = ∆𝐸𝑀𝑀 + ∆𝐺𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟 + ∆𝐺𝑛𝑜𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟 − 𝑇∆𝑆 , where ∆𝐸𝑀𝑀 is the
gas phase interaction energy including the electrostatic and the van der Waals interactions; ∆𝐺𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟

is the polar contributions to the desolvation free energy, which is calculated with the GB equation;
∆𝐺𝑛𝑜𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟 is the nonpolar component of the desolvation free energy, which is estimated
empirically by using the solvent accessible surface area; 𝑇∆𝑆 represents the change of the
conformational entropy. In this study, the contribution of the conformational entropy was not
considered, because the calculation of this term usually brings large errors for large-size systems
like those studied in this work[48-52], which do not improve the calculation accuracy of the binding
free energy. In order to explore the molecular mechanism for the influences of E484K mutation on
the binding free energy, the MMGBSA calculation results were also decomposed into per-residue
contributions.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
E484K mutation enhances the binding affinity between RBD and the receptor hACE2
The binding free energies of the wild-type RBD and the E484K mutant complexed with the receptor
hACE2 were calculated, respectively, by using MD simulations combined with MMGBSA method.
Then the difference in the binding free energy between the wild-type and the mutant systems was
computed to investigate the impacts of the E484K mutation on the binding affinity of RBD with its
receptor hACE2. In order to ensure the convergence of our calculation results, a total of five
independent MD simulations as well as the corresponding MMGBSA calculations were performed
both for the wild-type and the mutant complex systems. The calculation results are listed in Table 2.
For most of these independent simulations, the binding free energies of the mutant RBD-hACE2
complex are distinctly lower than those of the wild-type. The average binding free energies for the
wild-type and the mutant RBD-hACE2 complexes are -59.10 kcal/mol and -70.53 kcal/mol,
respectively, which indicates that the E484K mutation significantly improves the binding affinity
between RBD with its receptor hACE2. Our calculation results are consistent with the observed
bioactivity changes, where the 501Y.V2 and 501Y.V3 SARS-CoV-2 strains with the E484K
mutation display more transmissibility than the original strains. In MMGBSA method, the sum of
the van der Waals and the nonpolar desolvation energies, i.e., ∆𝐸𝑣𝑑𝑤 + ∆𝐺𝑛𝑜𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟 , represents the
hydrophobic interactions between the binding partners. The sum of the gas-phase electrostatic
interactions and the polar desolvation energy, i.e., ∆𝐸𝑒𝑙𝑒 + ∆𝐺𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟 , is responsible for the burial of
the charged or polar groups upon binding. From Table 2, it is found that both for the wild-type and
the mutant RBD-hACE2 complexes, the hydrophobic interactions are favorable, whereas the burial
of the charged and polar groups is unfavorable. However, the E484K mutation significantly
enhances the gas-phase electrostatic interactions and alleviates the unfavorable energies for the
burial of the charged and polar groups upon the binding of RBD with hACE2 as shown in Table 2.
The value of ∆𝐸𝑒𝑙𝑒 is significantly decreased from -654.74 kcal/mol to -1113.71 kcal/mol and the
∆𝐸𝑒𝑙𝑒 + ∆𝐺𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟 energies is reduced from 44.54 kcal/mol to 35.99 kcal/mol, which mainly
contributes to the improved binding affinity for the mutant system compared with the wild-type
complex. Besides that, E484K mutation also leads to the decrease of the van der Waals and the
nonpolar desolvation energies as shown in Table 2, where the value of ∆𝐸𝑣𝑑𝑤 + ∆𝐺𝑛𝑜𝑛𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟 is
reduce from -103.64 kcal/mol to -106.52 kcal/mol. Our results indicate that the mutation results in
more tight binding between RBD and hACE2. The tighter binding induced by E484K mutation also
contributes to the enhancements of the binding affinity for the mutant complex system.

By analysis of the binding interface around the mutated site of Glu484, it is found that there
exist several charged residues on the receptor hACE2, including Glu35, Asp38 and Glu75 with
negative charges, as well as Lys31 with positive charge (see Fig.1(a)). On average, the interface at
the side of hACE2 exhibits electronegative character, which is unfavorable for the electrostatic
interactions with the negatively charged Glu484. However, upon the replacement of Glu484 by Lys,
these unfavorable gas-phase electrostatic interactions involving the residue 484 were converted to
be favorable and thus the gas-phase electrostatic binding energy are significantly decreased as
shown in Table 2, where the electrostatic energy is reduced from -654.74 kcal/mol to -1113.71
kcal/mol. In addition to the changes in the electrostatic interactions, we also investigate the
mechanism for the decrease of the van der Waals and the polar desolvation energies caused by the
E484K mutation. Based on the MD simulation trajectories, the average conformation in the MD
simulation of the mutant complex was superposed onto that of the wild-type, as displayed in Fig.
1(b). Only the result for one of the five simulations was shown in Fig. 1(b), and the similar results
were obtained for the other simulation trajectories (data not shown). It is found that the residue
Glu484 is located on a flexible loop of RBD, and the substitution of Glu484 by Lys leads to obvious
conformational movements of the flexible loop towards the receptor hACE2, which results in the
more tight binding between RBD and hACE2. Our simulation results are consistent with the
simulation results of Nelson[33]. Therefore, the conformational rearrangements of the binding
interface caused by the mutation result in the decrease of the van der Waals and the polar desolvation
energies. The conformational movements of the flexible loop may be due to the more favorable
electrostatic forces between RBD and hACE2 in the mutant complex.

charged residues are displayed with the stick model in red and blue colors, respectively. (b) The

movements of the mutant system compared with the wild-type.
In order to reveal the key residues responsible for the improvements of the binding affinity
between RBD and hACE2, the per-residue energy decomposition analysis of MMGBSA was
performed and the calculation results are displayed in Fig. 2. Only one of the five independent MD
simulation trajectories was analyzed in the following studies, and the similar results can be obtained
for the other simulation trajectories. Our calculation results show that in the wild-type RBD, the
binding free energy contributed by the residue Glu484 is a positive value, which implies that the
presence of Glu is unfavorable for the binding of RBD to hACE2 owing to the
electrostatic repulsions as discussed above. Whereas, upon the substitution of Glu484 with Lys, the
unfavorable electrostatic interactions were changed to be favorable and the binding free energy
contributed by Glu484 became a negative value, as shown in Fig. 2. Besides the mutated residue
E484K itself, the contributions to the binding free energy by the residues Tyr489, Gln493, Leu492,
Phe490, Phe486 and Asn487 on RBD are also distinctly promoted, as shown in Fig. 2(a). At the side
of hACE2, the residues Tyr83, Leu79 and Gln24 also exhibit improved contributions to the binding
free energy, as displayed in Fig. 2(b). The improvements of the binding affinity contributed by these
residues are mainly attributed to the more tight binding interface caused by the E484K mutation.

Based on the MD simulation trajectories, the conformational rearrangements around these residues
were analyzed in detail. Our simulation results show that the conformational movements of the loop
where the mutated residue is located also draw the region of residues 489-494 to move closer
towards the receptor hACE2. Compared with the wild-type RBD-hACE2 complex structure, the
sidechain of the residue Tyr489 moves closely towards the residue Tyr83 on hACE2 and form a new
hydrogen bond between them in the mutant complex as shown in Table 3, in which the residues
Tyr489 and Asn487 on RBD, and Gln24 and Tyr83 on hACE2 form a hydrogen bonds network in
the mutant complex as shown in Fig. 3(a). The better packing of these residues and the new formed
hydrogen bonds network between them account for the enhanced binding affinity of the mutant
complex. The binding free energies of Tyr489 and Asn487 on RBD are decreased respectively from
-0.97 kcal/mol and -1.48 kcal/mol to -3.02 kcal/mol and -2.35 kcal/mol, and those of Gln24 and
Tyr83 on hACE2 are decreased from -2.11 kcal/mol and -2.81 kcal/mol to -2.56 kcal/mol and -4.88
kcal/mol, respectively. Fig. 3(b) shows that in the wild-type structure, the sidechains of the residues
Leu492, Gln493 on RBD, and Lys31 on hACE2 are relatively far apart. Whereas, they move closer
in the mutant structure and form new hydrogen bonds between them as shown in Table 3. The better
packing of these residues and the more stable hydrogen bonds between them contribute to the
stronger binding free energy for the residues Leu492 and Gln 493 in the mutant complex. Compared
with the wild-type structure, the binding free energies of the residues Leu492 and Gln493 on RBD
are changed from -0.088 kcal/mol and -1.25 kcal/mol to -1.57 kcal/mol and -3.82 kcal/mol,
respectively. It should be noted that the E484K mutation may also cause decreased binding
interactions for some residues. The electro-repulsive interactions between Lys31 on hACE2 and the
mutated Lys484 lead to unfavorable contribution of Lys31 to the binding free energy in the mutant
structure, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 2. The decrease in the occupancy of the hydrogen bonds
formed by Lys417 and Tyr505 with the corresponding residues in hACE2 results in the decreased
contribution of these two residues to the binding affinity, as shown in Table 3 and Fig. 3(c). However,
the unfavorable effects caused by the E484K mutation are minor. For most of the residues on the
binding interface, the E484K mutation results in favorable electrostatic forces as well as more tight
binding mode, which distinctly improves the binding affinity.

investigated to reveal the impacts of the E484K mutation on the binding affinities between them.
For each RBD-antibody complex, five independent MD simulations were performed both for the
wild-type and the mutant systems. Based on these simulation trajectories, the binding free energy
of the wild-type RBD and the E484K mutant, respectively, complexed with these antibodies were
calculated by using the MMGBSA method, and then the changes in the binding free energies
between the wild-type and the mutant systems were computed to explore the influences of the
E484K mutation on the binding affinities of RBD with these various neutralizing antibodies and
nanobodies. The average binding free energy of the five MD simulations for each RBD-antibody
complex is shown in Table 4, and the results for individual simulations are shown in Table S1. It is
found that in these six studied neutralizing antibodies, five antibodies including S2M11, BD23,
BD368-2, nanobody Nb20 and nanobody H11-D4, exhibit significantly decreased binding affinities
with the E484K mutant compared with the wild-type RBD. The average binding free energies are
increased from -58.02 kcal/mol, -54.24 kcal/mol, -48.41 kcal/mol, -64.06 kcal/mol and -47.77
kcal/mol to -41.52 kcal/mol, -32.96 kcal/mol, -39.53 kcal/mol, -48.79 kcal/mol and -37.15 kcal/mol
for these antibodies, respectively. Our results indicate that for most of the studied neutralizing
antibodies and nanobodies, the E484K mutation significantly reduces the binding affinities between
these various antibodies and RBD, which may lessen the neutralization activity and even escape
from these neutralizing antibodies. For nanobody MR17-K99Y, the E484K mutation has small
effects on the binding affinity between this nanobody and RBD, where the binding free energy is
changed from -70.71 kcal/mol to -71.22 kcal/mol. From the different components of the binding
free energy as displayed in Table 4, it can be observed that for all these studied systems, the
electrostatic energies are increased upon the mutation of E484K, which significantly penalize the
binding of the antibodies to the mutant RBD. Especially, for the antibodies S2M11, BD23, BD3682 and nanobody H11-D4, the electrostatic interaction is attractive in the wild-type complex where
Glu with negative charge is present in the position at 484. Whereas, when Glu484 is mutated to Lys
with positive charge, the attractive electrostatic interactions are changed to be repulsive as shown
in Table 4, which are predominantly responsible for the decreased binding affinities of these
antibodies with the E484K mutant RBD. For the other antibodies, the electrostatic energies were
also raised in different degrees, which are disadvantaged for the binding of these antibodies with
the mutant RBD. In summary, for most of the studied neutralizing antibodies, the E484K mutation
significantly reduces the binding affinities between these antibodies with RBD, and the decrease of
the binding affinities is mainly due to the repulsive electrostatic interactions caused by the mutation.
Our results indicate that the E484K mutation may has disadvantageous effects on the neutralization
activities and even may escape from the neutralization of these antibodies.

In order to explore the physical mechanism and the related key residues responsible for the
raising of the electrostatic energies caused by the E484K mutation, the changes of the binding free
energy contributed by each residue as well as the mutation-induced local structural rearrangements
were investigated for all these studied RBD-antibody systems based on the MD simulation
trajectories and the per-residue energy decomposition analysis of the MMGBSA method. For each
studied complex system, only one of the five independent MD simulation trajectories was analyzed
in the following studies, and the similar results can be obtained for the other simulation trajectories.
For the neutralizing antibody BD23 complexed with RBD, the residue E484 of RBD forms
attractive electrostatic interactions with the residue Arg107 on BD23 in the wild-type structure, as
shown in Fig. 4(a). However, upon the mutation of GLu484 by Lys, the attractive electrostatic
interactions with Arg107 are changed to be repulsive, which also leads to the sidechains of Lys484
and Arg107 moving apart. MMGBSA calculations show that the electrostatic energies contributed
by the residues 484 and 107 are significantly increased from -78.55 kcal/mol and -4.18 kcal/mol to
-1.62 kcal/mol and 31.28 kcal/mol (as displayed in Table 5), respectively, which are mainly
responsible for the reduced binding affinity between the mutant RBD and the neutralizing antibody
BD23.

Fig. 4. The locations as well as the conformational rearrangements of the key residues responsible
for the raising of the electrostatic energies caused by the E484K mutation for the complex systems
formed by RBD with the neutralizing antibody BD23 (a), the nanobody H11-D4 (b), the neutralizing
antibody BD368-2(c), the nanobody Nb20 (d), the nanobody MR17-K99Y (e) and the neutralizing
antibody S2M11 (f), respectively.

A similar situation is also observed for the nanobody H11-D4, where the positively charged
residue Arg52 provides attractive electrostatic interactions with Glu484 of RBD in the wild-type
complex structure as shown in Fig. 4(b). But the attractive electrostatic interactions are reversed to
be repulsive when the negatively charged residue Glu484 is replaced by the positively charged Lys,
which pushes these two residues away and weakens the binding affinity between RBD and the
nanobody H11-D4.
For the neutralizing antibody BD368-2 complexed with RBD, the negatively charged residue
Glu484 of RBD is sandwiched between two positively charged residues Arg100 and Arg102 of the
antibody BD368-2, and the electrostatic interactions between them contribute to the stability of this
kind of local structural arrangements, as shown in Fig. 4(c). Whereas, when the negatively charged
residue Glu484 is substituted by Lys with positive charges, the electrostatic repulsions exerted by
Arg100 and Arg102 lead to the swing away of the sidechain of Lys484. The electrostatic energies
contributed by these charged residues are significantly increased in the mutant complex compared
with the wild-type system as shown in Table 5, which mainly account for the reduced binding
affinity of the antibody BD368-2 with the mutant RBD. There also exists a negatively charged
residue Asp106 in BD368-2, which is more preferred for the binding of the mutant RBD compared
to the wild-type. But the impact of Asp106 is relatively small owing to its large distance to the

mutant residue E484K.
In the complex of nanobody Nb20 with RBD, upon the mutation of E484 by Lys, the attractive
electrostatic interactions formed by Glu484 on RBD with Arg31 and Aeg97 on Nb20 are changed
to be repulsive, which leads to the sidechain of Lys484 swing to the opposite direction, as shown in
Fig. 4(d). The repulsive electrostatic interactions combined with the local structural rearrangements
contribute to the reduced binding affinity between Nb20 and RBD, as indicated in Table 5. For all
the above neutralizing antibodies, a similar physical mechanism was observed to be responsible for
the reduced RBD-antibody binding affinity caused by the mutation E484K, where the attractive
electrostatic interactions are converted to be repulsive resulted by the residue mutation with reverse
charges.
For nanobody MR17-K99Y complexed with RBD, the positively charged residues Arg59,
Arg33 and Lys65 on MR17-K99Y are electrostatically attractive with Glu484 on RBD in the wildtype complex, as shown in Fig. 4(e). The E484K mutation results in the convertion of these
electrostatic interactions from attraction to repulsion, which also leads to the sidechain of Lys484
swing towards the concave of the antibody, as displayed in the right sub-figure in Fig. 4(e). The
sidechain swing of Lys484 results in better packing of the binding interface and thus decreases the
van der Waals energy, which compensates the increase of the electrostatic energy as indicated in
Table 4 and Table 5. In total, the E484K mutation has little effect on the binding affinity between
the nanobody MR17-K99Y and RBD due to the compensation of the impacts on the electrostatic
interactions and van der Waals interactions.
For the complex structure of the neutralizing antibody S2M11 with RBD, the residue Glu484
forms several hydrogen bonds with the polar residues Ser55, Asn52 and Tyr33 of S2M11 in the
wild-type system. When the residue Glu484 is substituted by Lys in the mutant system, most of
these hydrogen bonds are destroyed and the electrostatic energies are significantly increased, as
shown in Fig. 4(f) and Table 5. Although the van der Waals energies are decreased, the decrease of
the van der Waals energies cannot compensate the increase of the electrostatic energies. Taken
together, the E484K mutation obviously reduces the binding affinity between the neutralizing
antibody S2M11 and RBD.
CONCLUSION
SARS-CoV-2 evolves continuously, and several new variants have emerged and widely spread
worldwide. It raised the worries about whether the new occurred variants would exhibit increased
transmissibility or evade the immune protect. To date, most of the naturally occurring mutations
have limited effects on the transmissibility, virulence and immune evasion of SARS-CoV-2.
However, serious attentions have been paid to the E484K mutation shared both by the 501Y.V2 and
501Y.V3 variants initially discovered respectively in the United Kingdom and Brazil, which is
considered to be potentially associated with improved transmissibility as well as decreased
neutralization activity of the present antibodies. Understanding the molecular mechanism behind
the impacts of the E484K mutation on the binding affinities of RBD with the receptor hACE2 as
well as with various neutralizing antibodies is of great significance for the developments of effective
vaccines and antibody drugs.
In the present work, the MD simulations combined with MMGBSA method were employed to
evaluate the receptor binding free energy both for the wild-type RBD and the E484K mutant, and
then the effects of the mutation on the binding affinity of RBD with the receptor hACE2 were

investigated. The calculation results show that the upon the substitution of Glu484 with Lys, the
unfavorable gas-phase electrostatic interactions between E484 and the negatively charged residues
in hACE2 were converted to be favorable, which significantly contributes to the improved binding
affinity of RBD with hACE2. Besides that, the E484K mutation also causes conformational
rearrangements of the local structure around the mutant residue, which results in more tight binding
interface of RBD with hACE2 and formation of some new hydrogen bonds. The better packing of
the binding interface and the formation of new hydrogen bonds also lead to the enhancements of the
binding affinity for the mutant complex system. The tighter RBD-receptor binding affinity caused
by the mutation may be responsible for the more transmissibility of the E484K-containing variants.
Additionally, in order to explore the impacts of the E484K mutation on the recognition of
neutralizing antibodies to RBD, six different neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies complexed
with RBD were studied, in which the changes of the binding free energy induced by the mutation
were calculated by using MD simulations with MMGBSA method. The calculation results revealed
that for most of the neutralizing antibodies and nanobodies, the E484K mutation significantly
reduces the binding affinities between RBD and these antibodies, which may weaken the
effectiveness of these antibodies and even evade the immune protect. The decrease in the binding
affinities is mainly resulted by the mutation-caused unfavorable electrostatic interactions between
RBD and the studied neutralizing antibodies. Our studies provide valuable information for the
developments of effective vaccines and therapeutic antibodies.
