Abstract
Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires reducing viral transmission. SARS-CoV-2 infection
is initiated by membrane fusion between the viral and host cell membranes, mediated by the viral spike
protein. We have designed a dimeric lipopeptide fusion inhibitor that blocks this critical first step of
infection for emerging coronaviruses and document that it completely prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection
in ferrets. Daily intranasal administration to ferrets completely prevented SARS-CoV-2 direct-contact
transmission during 24-hour co-housing with infected animals, under stringent conditions that resulted
in infection of 100% of untreated animals. These lipopeptides are highly stable and non-toxic and thus
readily translate into a safe and effective intranasal prophylactic approach to reduce transmission of
SARS-CoV-2.

Main text
Infection by SARS-CoV-2 requires membrane fusion between the viral envelope and the host cell
membrane, at either the cell surface or the endosomal membrane. The fusion process is mediated by the
viral envelope spike glycoprotein, S. Upon viral attachment or uptake, host factors trigger large-scale
conformational rearrangements in S, including a refolding step that leads directly to membrane fusion
and viral entry (1-6). Peptides corresponding to the highly conserved heptad repeat (HR) domain at the
C-terminus of the S protein (HRC peptides) may prevent this refolding and inhibit fusion, thereby
preventing infection (7-12) (Fig. 1a-c). The HRC peptides form six-helix bundle (6HB)-like assemblies
with the extended intermediate form of the S protein trimer, thereby disrupting the structural
rearrangement of S that drives membrane fusion (7).

We have previously demonstrated that lipid conjugation of HRC-derived inhibitory peptides markedly
increases antiviral potency and in vivo half-life (13-16), and used this strategy to create entry inhibitors
for prophylaxis and/or treatment of human parainfluenza virus type 3, measles virus, and Nipah virus
infection (14, 15, 17-20). Both dimerization and peptide integration into cell membranes proved key to
ensure respiratory tract protection and prevent systemic lipopeptide dissemination (16, 18). The lipidconjugated peptides administered intranasally to animals reached high concentrations both in the upper
and lower respiratory tract, and the specific nature of the lipid can be designed to modulate the extent of
transit from the lung to the systemic circulation and organs (18-22). Lipid conjugation also enabled
activity against viruses that do not fuse until they have been taken up via endocytosis (23). Here, we
show that a dimeric form of a SARS-CoV-2 S-specific lipopeptide is a potent inhibitor of fusion
mediated by the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, prevents viral entry, and, when administered intranasally,
completely prevents direct-contact transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets. We propose this compound
as a candidate antiviral, to be administered by inhalation or intranasal spray, for pre-exposure or early
post-exposure prophylaxis for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in humans.

To improve the antiviral potency of the previously assessed SARS-CoV-2 HRC-lipopeptide fusion
inhibitor (7), we compared monomeric and dimeric derivatives of the SARS-CoV-2 S-derived HRCpeptide (Fig. 1d). Initial functional evaluation of the SARS-CoV-2 HRC lipopeptides was conducted
with a cell-cell fusion assay based on β-galactosidase (β-gal) complementation that we adapted for
assessment of SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated fusion. For this assay, cells expressing human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (hACE2) and the N-terminal fragment of β-gal were mixed with cells expressing
the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the C-terminal fragment of β-gal. When fusion mediated by S occurs,
the two fragments of β-gal combine to generate a catalytically active species, and fusion is detected via
the luminescence that results from substrate processing by β-gal. This assay format allows the assessment
of potential SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated membrane fusion inhibitors without the use of infectious virus.
The assay measures an inhibitor’s ability to block fusion of S-bearing cells with receptor-bearing target
cells and is predictive of in vivo antiviral activity (14).

Fig. 1d shows the antiviral potency of two monomeric and two dimeric SARS-CoV-2 S-derived 36amino acid (Fig. 1b) HRC-peptides, without (SARSHRC and [SARSHRC-PEG4]2) or with (SARSHRCPEG4-chol and [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol) appended cholesterol, in cell-cell fusion assays. The percentage
inhibition corresponds to the extent of luminescence signal suppression observed in the absence of any
inhibitor (i.e., 0% inhibition corresponds to maximum luminescence signal). Dimerization increased the
peptide potency (see SARSHRC vs. [SARSHRC-PEG4]2 in Fig. 1d). The dimeric form of HRC lipopeptide
was also more potent than its monomeric lipopeptide counterpart (SARSHRC-PEG4-chol IC50 ~10 nM
and [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol IC50~3nM, (Two-way ANOVA, p<0.0001)). This dimeric cholesterolconjugated peptide ([SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol; red line in Fig. 1d) is the most potent lipopeptide against
SARS-CoV-2 that has been identified thus far. A lipopeptide based on the human parainfluenza virus
type 3 (HPIV3) F protein HRC domain, used as a negative control, did not inhibit fusion at any

concentration tested (Fig. S1). A cellular toxicity (MTT) assay was performed in parallel with this
experiment to evaluate the potential toxicity of each lipopeptide (Fig. S2). Toxicity for each of the
lipopeptides in this assay was minimal, even at the highest concentrations tested (<20% at 100 µM). No
toxicity was observed for the dimeric SARS-CoV-2 lipopeptide at its IC90 entry inhibitory concentration
(~350 nM).

Despite the overall stability of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, variants with mutations in S have spread
globally (24-32). These mutations in S altered infectivity of cells (e.g., D614G (24)) or were located in
the putative target domain of the HRC peptide (e.g., S943P). To determine the potency of the [SARSHRCPEG4]2-chol peptide for a range of variant SARS-CoV-2 viruses, we examined fusion inhibition
mediated by each of these emerging S protein mutants. In addition, to assess the potential for broadspectrum activity we assessed potency against the S of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (using dipeptidyl
peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor-bearing cells as the target for the latter). Fig. 1e shows the IC50 and IC90 of
[SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol for inhibition of fusion by the S mutants and in addition, for SARS-CoV S and
MERS-CoV S. The [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol lipopeptide inhibited all SARS-CoV-2 strains with S
mutations at comparable potency and showed considerable potency against both SARS-CoV and MERSCoV.

The lead peptide, [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol, was subsequently assessed for its ability to block entry of live
SARS-CoV-2 in VeroE6 and VeroE6 cells overexpressing the protease TMPRSS2 (33), one of the host
factors thought to facilitate viral entry at the cell membrane (2). The TMPRSS2-expressing cells
accurately represent the entry route in airway cells, an important feature highlighted by the failure of
chloroquine to inhibit infection in TMPRSS2-expressing Vero cells and in human lung cells (34). The
[SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol peptide was dissolved in an aqueous buffer containing 2% dimethylsulfoxide
(DMSO), was incubated with cells for 1 hr at 37 °C, after which a fixed concentration of SARS-CoV-2

was added. After 8 hrs at 37 °C, fusion events were quantified by SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP)
staining. The [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol peptide inhibited live virus entry with an IC50 ~300 nM in cells not
overexpressing TMPRSS and ~5 nM in VeroE6-TMPRSS2, with an IC90 ~1 uM in both cell types (Fig.
2a). In addition, we assessed the efficacy of the [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol peptide dissolved in a sucrose
solution instead of DMSO, which would strengthen translational potential for human use. [SARSHRCPEG4]2-chol peptide retained its potency in this formulation, with an IC50 ~300 nM in cells not
overexpressing TMPRSS2 and ~5 nM in VeroE6-TMPRSS2 (Fig. 2b). The efficacy data are
summarized in Fig. 2c.

Ferrets are an ideal model for assessing respiratory virus transmission, either by direct contact or by
aerosol transmission (35-40). Mustelids are highly susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2, as also
illustrated by frequent COVID-19 outbreaks at mink farms (41). Direct contact transmission of SARSCoV in ferrets was demonstrated in 2003 (42), and both direct contact and airborne transmission have
recently been shown in ferrets for SARS-CoV-2 (36, 43, 44). Direct contact transmission in the ferret
model is highly reproducible (100% transmission from donor to acceptor animals), but ferrets display
limited clinical signs. After infection via direct inoculation or transmission, SARS-CoV-2 can readily be
detected in and isolated from the throat and nose, and viral replication leads to seroconversion.

To assess the efficacy of [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol in preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, naive ferrets
were treated prophylactically with the lipopeptide before being co-housed with SARS-CoV-2 infected
ferrets. In this setup, transmission via multiple routes can theoretically occur (aerosol, orofecal, and
scratching or biting during play or fight), and ferrets are continuously exposed to infectious virus during
the period of co-housing, providing a stringent test for antiviral efficacy. The study design is shown in
Fig. 3a. Three donor ferrets (grey in diagram) were inoculated intranasally with 5.4 x 105 TCID50 SARSCoV-2 on day 0. Twelve recipient ferrets housed separately were treated by nose drops with a mock

preparation (red) or [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol peptide (green) on 1- and 2-days post-inoculation (DPI) of
the donor animals. The [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol peptides for intranasal administration were dissolved to
a concentration of 6 mg/mL in an aqueous buffer containing 2% DMSO, administering a final dose of
2.7 mg/kg to ferrets (450 uL, equally divided over both nostrils). Six hours after the second treatment on
2 DPI, one infected donor ferret was co-housed with four naive recipient ferrets (two mock-treated, two
peptide-treated). The experiment was performed in three separate, negatively pressurized HEPA-filtered
ABSL3-isolator cages. After a 24-hour transmission period, co-housing was stopped and donor, mocktreated and peptide-treated ferrets were housed as separate groups. Additional [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol
peptide treatments were given to recipient animals on 3 and 4 DPI. Peptide stocks and working dilutions
had similar IC50’s, confirming that peptide-treated ferrets were always dosed with comparable amounts
(Fig. S3a and 3b).

Throat and nose swabs were collected from ferrets daily for the first week, and additionally on 14 and
21 DPI, for assessment of viral replication. Small volume blood samples were collected on 0, 7, 14, and
21 DPI for assessing the presence of neutralizing antibodies in serum. Fig. 3b and 3c shows the viral
loads (detection of viral genomes via RT-qPCR) for directly inoculated donor animals (grey), mocktreated recipient animals (red) and lipopeptide-treated recipient animals (green). All directly inoculated
donor ferrets were productively infected, as shown by SARS-CoV-2 genome detection in throat and nose
swabs, and efficiently and reproducibly transmitted the virus to all mock-treated acceptor ferrets (Fig.
3b and 3c, red curves). Notably, productive SARS-CoV-2 infection was not detected in the throat or
nose of any of the peptide-treated recipient animals (Fig. 3b and 3c, green curves). A slight rise in viral
loads in samples collected at 3DPI was detected, at the end of the co-housing, confirming that peptidetreated animals were exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, from 4 DPI onwards, there was a clear
treatment effect in which the [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol peptide protected 6/6 ferrets from transmission and
productive infection. Donor ferrets and 6/6 mock-treated recipient animals seroconverted on 21 DPI.

None of the peptide-treated animals seroconverted, demonstrating that in-host virus replication was
completely blocked by [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol) (Fig. 4). None of the animals showed clinical signs as a
result of infection or treatment over the course of the experiment, and body weights remained stable
(Fig. S4).

Based on the in vitro and in vivo results shown here, we expect that prophylactic intranasal administration
of the [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol peptide prevents transmission from infected to uninfected individuals,
even during a 24-hour period of intense direct contact. In vitro data suggest that this lipopeptide will be
effective against emerging variants with mutations in S and possibly against other coronaviruses. This
efficacy can be readily assessed in real time and adjustments made if needed.

Parallel approaches to prevent transmission that target ACE2 or the interaction between S and ACE2
have also shown promise in vitro (e.g. the “miniprotein” approach recently reported by Cao et al (45)).
In distinction to various antibody or nanobody products (46) the [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol peptide is
inexpensive to produce, has a long shelf life, and does not require refrigeration. Moreover, this is the
first compound to convincingly prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a relevant animal model. We
envision the use of fusion inhibitory lipopeptides as complementary to other pandemic mitigation
strategies. In addition to the nasal drop administration for the [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol peptide, other
routes that would be equally or more acceptable to humans, for example inhalation devices, are being
explored. This HRC lipopeptide fusion inhibitor is feasible for advancement to human use and should
readily translate into a safe and effective nasal spray or inhalation administered fusion inhibitor for antiSARS-CoV-2 prophylaxis, thus supporting containment of the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Figure 1: Peptide-lipid conjugates that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike (S)-mediated fusion. (A) The functional domains of
SARS-CoV-2 S protein: receptor-binding domain (RBD) and heptad repeats (HRN and HRC) are indicated. (B) Sequence of
the peptides that derive from the HRC domain of SARS-CoV-2 S. (C) Monomeric and dimeric forms of lipid tagged SARSCoV-2 inhibitory peptides that were assessed in cell-cell fusion assays. (D) Cell-cell fusion assays with different inhibitory
peptides. The percentage inhibition is shown for four different peptides used at increasing concentrations. Inhibitory
concentrations 50% and 90% were calculated (dotted lines). Percent inhibition was calculated as the ratio of relative
luminescence units in the presence of a specific concentration of inhibitor and the relative luminescence units in the absence
of inhibitor and corrected for background luminescence. Data are means ± standard deviation (SD) from three separate
experiments. The difference between the results for [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol and SARSHRC-PEG4-chol lipopeptides are
significant (Two-way ANOVA, **** p<0.0001). (E) Fusion inhibitory activity of [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol peptide against
SARS-CoV-2 S variants, MERS-CoV-2 S, and SARS-CoV S. Data are means ± standard deviation (SD) from three separate

Materials and Methods

Ethics statement. Influenza virus, SARS-CoV-2 and Aleutian Disease Virus seronegative female ferrets
(Mustela putorius furo), weighing 900-1200g, were obtained from a commercial breeder (Triple F
Farms, PA, USA). Animals were housed and experiments were performed in compliance with the Dutch
legislation for the protection of animals used for scientific purposes (2014, implementing EU Directive
2010/63). Research was conducted under a project license from the Dutch competent authority (license
number AVD1010020174312) and the study protocol was approved by the institutional Animal Welfare
Body (Erasmus MC permit number 17-4312-07). Animal welfare was monitored on a daily basis.

Lipopeptide synthesis. The peptide (SARSHRC) corresponding to residues 1168–1203 of SARS-CoV-2
S with a C-terminal -GSGSGC spacer sequence was prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS).
The SARSHRC peptide was acetylated at the N-terminus and amidated at the C-terminus. The crude
peptide was purified by reversed-phase HPLC chromatography and characterization by MALDI-TOF
MS. The SARSHRC-PEG4-chol, [SARSHRC]2-PEG11, and [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol were synthesize d via
chemoselective thiol- Michael addition reactions between the terminal thiol group on the peptide
cysteine residue and maleimide functional PEG linkers or PEG-cholesterol linkers as previously

described (1). HPLC purification and lyophilization yielded the peptide-lipid conjugates as white
powders. The identity of the conjugates was verified by MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. S5).

Dissolving [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol for use in experiments. [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol was supplied as a
white powder in aliquots of 10 mg. For in vitro experiments with live virus and in vivo experiments in
ferrets, 10 mg of [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol was dissolved in 33.3 ul DMSO, which was subsequently
added to 1632.7 ul de-ionized H2O. This yielded a final aqueous solution of lipopeptide dissolved at a
concentration of 6 mg/mL containing 2% DMSO. To obtain peptide dissolved in aqueous solution
without DMSO , 100 mg/ml of the [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol peptide in DMS0 (10 mg of peptide in 100
ul of DMSO) and 1 mg/ml of sucrose in sterile water were prepared. 10 ul of the peptide solution (1mg)
was added to 100µl of sucrose (0.1 mg). Lyophilisation of the peptide solution (DMSO + sucrose) was
performed over-night and dry powder was resuspended in 50µl of sterile water to a final concentration
is 20 mg/ml in water without any DMSO.

Cells. Human kidney Epithelial (HEK) 293T and Vero (African green monkey kidney) cells were grown
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented
with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics in 5% CO2 at 37°C. VeroE6 (ATCC CRL-1586)
and VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco) with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco),
10 mM Hepes (Lonza), 1.5 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3, Lonza), penicillin (10,000 IU/mL)
and streptomycin (10,000 IU/mL)(2).

HAE cultures. The EpiAirway AIR-100 system (MatTek Corporation) consists of normal humanderived tracheal/bronchial epithelial cells that have been cultured to form a pseudostratified, highly

differentiated mucociliary epithelium closely resembling that of epithelial tissue in vivo. Cultures were
transferred to six-well plates containing 1.0 ml medium per well (basolateral feeding, with the apical
surface remaining exposed to air) and acclimated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 24h prior to experimentation
(3).

Plasmids. The cDNAs coding for hACE2 fused to the fluorescent protein Venus, dipeptidyl peptidase 4
(DPP4) fused to the fluorescent protein Venus, SARS-CoV-2 S, SARS-CoV S, and MERS-S (codon
optimized for mammalian expression) were cloned in a modified version of the pCAGGS (with
puromycin resistance for selection).

β-Gal complementation-based fusion assay. We previously adapted a fusion assay based on alpha
complementation of β-galactosidase (β-Gal)(4). In this assay, hACE2 receptor-bearing cells (or
dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor-bearing cells for MERS-CoV-2 experiments) expressing the
omega peptide of β-Gal are mixed with cells co-expressing glycoprotein S and the alpha peptide of βGal, and cell fusion leads to alpha-omega complementation. Fusion is stopped by lysing the cells and,
after addition of the substrate (®The Tropix Galacto-Star™ chemiluminescent reporter assay system,
Applied Biosystem), luminescence is quantified on a Tecan M1000PRO microplate reader.

Cell toxicity assay. HEK293T or Vero cells were incubated with the indicated concentration of the
peptides or vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) at 37 °C. Cell viability was determined after 24h using the
Vybrant MTT Cell proliferation Assay Kit according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. The absorbance
was read at 540 nm using Tecan M1000PRO microplate reader. HAE cultures were incubated at 37°C
in the presence or absence of 1, 10, or 100 µM concentrations of the peptide, and peptide was added to
the feeding medium every 2 days for 7 days. Cell viability was determined on day 7 as above.

Virus. SARS-CoV-2 (isolate BetaCoV/Munich/BavPat1/2020; kindly provided by Prof. Dr. C. Drosten)
was propagated to passage 3 on VeroE6 cells in OptiMEM I (1X) + GlutaMAX (Gibco), supplemented
with penicillin (10,000 IU/mL, Lonza) and streptomycin (10,000 IU/mL, Lonza) at 37°C. VeroE6 cells
were inoculated at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. Supernatant was harvested 72 hours post
inoculation (HPI), cleared by centrifugation and stored at -80°C. All live virus work was performed in a
Class II Biosafety Cabinet under BSL-3 conditions at Erasmus MC.

In vitro potency of HRC dimer-chol. Potency of [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol was determined in an in vitro
live virus fusion assay. Original stocks and working dilutions for animal experiments were tested in
triplicate in VeroE6 and VeroE6-TMPRSS2 cells at concentrations of 0.06 nM to 5 µM. Peptide was
pre-incubated with the cells for 1 hr at 37°C. After pre-incubation, virus (600 TCID50) was added. After
8 hrs at 37°C, cells were washed and fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min at room temperature (RT). Plates
were submerged in 70% ethanol and stained in a BSL-2 laboratory. In short, cells were washed with PBS
and blocked with 10% normal goat serum (NGS) for 30 min at RT. Primary mouse-anti-SARS-CoV
nucleocapsid antibody (1:1000, Biorad) was incubated for 1 hr at RT in 10% normal goat serum (NGS).
After washing, secondary goat-anti-mouse IgG/FITC antibody (1:1000, Invitrogen) was incubated for
45 min at RT in 10% NGS. Fluorescent spots were visualized with an Amersham Typhoon Biomolecular
Imager (GE Healthcare) and counted with ImageQuant TL 7.0 software (GE Healthcare).

Ferret transmission experiment. All animal handlings were performed under anaesthesia with a
mixture of ketamine/medetomidine (10mg/kg and 0.05mg/kg, respectively) antagonized by atipamezole
(0.25 mg/kg). Three donor ferrets were inoculated intranasally with 5.4 x 105 TCID50 of SARS-CoV-2
in 450µl (225µl instilled dropwise in each nostril) and were housed together in a negatively pressurized

HEPA-filtered ABSL-3 isolator. This was considered the start of the experiment (0 days post inoculation,
DPI). At the same time, twelve direct contact ferrets were divided over three other isolators. Ferrets were
either mock-treated (vehicle, 2%DMSO in distilled water) or treated with [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol on 14 DPI. The peptide was inoculated intranasally in 450µl (225µl instilled dropwise in each nostril), HRC
dimer-chol treated ferrets received a peptide dose of ~2.7 mg/kg. Leftover batches were stored at -80°C
for later use in in vitro potency assays. At 2 DPI, six hours after the second treatment, one donor ferret
was placed in the same isolators as two mock-treated and two peptide-treated ferrets, in three separate
isolators (Fig. 3a). Each isolator now contained five ferrets, the donor ferret, the mock-treated recipient
ferrets and the [SARSHRC-PEG4]2-chol-treated recipient ferrets. At 3 DPI, 18 hours after onset of cohousing, the animals received a third mock or peptide treatment, Six hours later, i.e. 24 hours after the
start of the co-housing, the donor animals were moved back to their original isolator and the mocktreated and peptide-treated ferrets were housed in two groups of six animals in clean isolators.

Throat and nose swabs were collected from the animals on 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14 and 21 DPI. Samples
were always obtained prior to dosing with mock or peptide. Swabs were stored at -80°C in virus transport
medium (Minimum Essential Medium Eagle with Hank's BSS (Lonza), 5 g L−1 lactalbumine enzymatic
hydrolysate, 10% glycerol (Sigma-Aldrich), 200 U/ml of penicillin, 200 mg/ml of streptomycin, 100
U/ml of polymyxin B sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich), and 250 mg/ml of gentamicin (Life Technologies)).
Blood samples were obtained from ferrets on 0, 7, 14 and 21 DPI by vena cava puncture. Blood was
collected in serum-separating tubes (Greiner), processed, heat-inactivated and sera were stored at -80°C.
The study was stopped at 21 DPI. All animal experiments were performed in class III isolators in a
negatively pressurized ABSL3 facility, all handlings were performed under general anaesthesia.

RNA isolation and RT-qPCR on throat and nose swabs. Sixty ul sample (virus transport medium in
which swabs are stored) was added to 90 ul of MagNA Pure 96 External Lysis Buffer (Roche). A known

concentration of phocine distemper virus (PDV) was added to the sample as internal control for the RNA
extraction (5). The 150 ul of sample/lysis buffer was added to a well of a 96-well plate containing 50 ul
of magnetic beads (AMPure XP, Beckman Coulter). After thorough mixing, the plate was incubated for
15 min at room temperature. The plate was then placed on a magnetic block (DynaMag™-96 Side
Skirted Magnet (ThermoFisher Scientific)) and incubated for 3 min to allow the displacement of the
beads towards the side of the magnet. Supernatants were carefully removed and beads were washed three
times for 30 sec at room temperature with 200 ul/well of 70% ethanol. After the last wash, a 20 ul multichannel pipet was used to remove residual ethanol. Plates were air-dried for 2 min at room temperature.
Plates were removed from the magnetic block and 50ul of PCR grade water was added to each well and
mixed. Plates were incubated for 5 min at room temperature and then placed back on the magnetic block
for 2 min to allow separation of the beads. Supernatants were pipetted in a new plate and RNA was
stored at -80°C. The RNA was directly used for RTqPCR using primers and probes targeting the E gene
of SARS-CoV-2 as previously described (6).

Virus neutralization of ferret sera. Seroconversion of ferrets was tested with ferret sera from 0, 7, 14
and 21 DPI. Duplicates of ferret sera were incubated with 100 TCID50 of virus in a 2-fold dilution series
starting at a concentration of 1:8 for 1 hr at 37°C. Virus-sera mix was added to VeroE6 cells and
incubated for 5 days at 37°C. Cytopathic effect was used as readout to determine the minimal serum
concentration required to inhibit CPE formation.
