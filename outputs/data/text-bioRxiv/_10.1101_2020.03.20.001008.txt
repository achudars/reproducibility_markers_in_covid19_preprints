ABSTRACT
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented need for rapid diagnostic testing.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization
(WHO) recommend a standard assay that includes an RNA extraction step from a nasopharyngeal
(NP) swab followed by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)
to detect the purified SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The current global shortage of RNA extraction kits has
caused a severe bottleneck to COVID-19 testing. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 RNA could
be detected from NP samples via a direct RT-qPCR assay that omits the RNA extraction step
altogether, and tested this hypothesis on a series of blinded clinical samples. The direct RT-qPCR
approach correctly identified 92% of NP samples (n = 155) demonstrated to be positive for SARSCoV-2 RNA by traditional clinical diagnostic RT-qPCR that included an RNA extraction. Thus,
direct RT-qPCR could be a front-line approach to identify the substantial majority of COVID-19
patients, reserving a repeat test with RNA extraction for those individuals with high suspicion of
infection but an initial negative result. This strategy would drastically ease supply chokepoints of
COVID-19 testing and should be applicable throughout the world.
MAIN
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has put exceptional strain on public health laboratories, hospital
laboratories, and commercial laboratories as they attempt to keep up with demands for SARSCoV-2 testing. The current diagnostic testing methods recommended by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States and the World Health Organization (WHO)
are traditional RT-qPCR assays that require two steps: first, an RNA extraction from patient
nasopharyngeal (NP) swab material, followed by RT-qPCR amplification of the extracted RNA to
detect viral RNA 1-3. The major bottleneck to widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing lies at the RNA
extraction step. The simplest manual kit (the Qiagen Viral RNA Mini) is no longer available, and
reagents and supplies for the larger automated instruments are extremely limited with uncertain
supply chains. While substitution of other RNA extraction kits 4,5 is possible, they too are in limited
supply. The current bottleneck is not simply the availability of RNA extraction kits, but also the
cost of the extraction assay, the labor and time required to perform it, and the fact that it is rate
limiting compared to the downstream RT-qPCR analysis. To address this issue, we tested the
unconventional approach of skipping the RNA extraction step altogether and directly loading
patient swab material into the RT-qPCR mix. Herein, we report that this approach (which we refer
to hereafter as “direct RT-qPCR”) correctly identified 92% of samples (n =155) previously shown
to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by conventional RT-qPCR featuring an RNA extraction.
Thus, our results suggest that this streamlined assay could greatly alleviate constraints to COVID19 testing in many regions of the world.
We initially conducted a pilot experiment using NP swabs from two COVID-19 patients who had
previously been verified for SARS-CoV-2 infection by the Vermont Department of Health
Laboratory (VDHL) using the CDC’s recommended RT-qPCR test. Both patient samples, which
were originally collected as NP swabs in 3 mL of M6 viral transport medium (termed diluent
hereafter), were pooled (equi-volume). RNA was extracted from 140 µL of the pooled sample
using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit, and purified RNA representing 11.3 µL of the original
swab diluent was detected as positive via standard RT-qPCR using the CDC 2019-nCoV N3
primer/probe set, with a CT of 18.7. In parallel, we added 7 µL of the pooled COVID-19 patient
NP swab diluent directly to the RT-qPCR reaction, and found that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was

successfully detected in the absence of an RNA extraction step. Compared to the same pooled NP
swab diluent extracted with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (after adjusting for the quantity of
swab diluent added in each case), adding the NP diluent directly into the RT-qPCR reaction
resulted in an ~ 4 CT drop in sensitivity (Fig. 1a). Preheating the NP diluent for five minutes at
70°C prior to RT-qPCR had no impact on viral RNA detection. These results provided proof-ofprinciple that successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from an NP swab sample by RT-qPCR
could be done in the absence of an RNA extraction step.
We next sought to validate the direct RT-qPCR approach on additional samples, determine the
optimal volume of NP swab diluent for use in the direct RT-qPCR assay, and further address the
potential impact of a prior heating step on assay sensitivity. NP samples from three COVID-19
patients who had previously been shown to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA at high,
intermediate, or low copy load by the Department of Laboratory Medicine at the University of
Washington (UW) in Seattle were heated or not at 95°C for 10 minutes and then directly loaded
into RT-qPCR reactions at 1, 3, or 5 µL volumes, or subjected to RNA extraction via the Roche
MagNA Pure 96 platform prior to loading the equivalent of ~20 µL of swab diluent into the RTqPCR reaction. The main findings of this experiment, shown in Table 1, were that i) SARS-CoV2 RNA could be detected in all three viral copy level samples at either input volume by direct RTqPCR, provided they were heated first, and ii) addition of less NP diluent led to more sensitive
detection of target RNA. Thus, heating appears important for subsequent detection of low viral
copy samples, presumably by denaturing inhibitors of the RT and/or PCR enzymes present in the
NP diluent. The best sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection was achieved when 3 µL of swab
diluent was used for direct RT-qPCR (Table 1).
The CDC RT-qPCR method includes an internal control primer/probe set for detection of human
RNase P. To ensure that direct RT-qPCR was able to detect the presence of this gene in NP swab
diluent, and to test whether our approach was generalizable to other primer/probe sets, we screened
seven donors (n = 4 COVID-19 positive; n = 3 COVID-19 negative) using the 2019-nCoV_N1,
2019-nCoV_N2, and RNase P primer/probe sets. Both the 2019-nCoV_N1 and 2019-nCoV_N2
primer/probe sets specifically detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in each sample from COVID-19
patients, but not in samples from the negative donors (Fig. 1b,c). In addition, RNase P RNA was
successfully detected in each donor by direct RT-qPCR (Fig. 1d). Collectively, these results
confirmed i) the validity of our direct RT-qPCR approach with additional virus-specific
primer/probe sets for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and ii) the presence of intact cellular RNA,
as detected with an internal primer-probe set targeting a host gene, in all samples tested.
To get an accurate view of how omission of the RNA extraction would perform in a real-world
clinical setting, we tested in a blinded fashion a panel of 150 NP swabs from COVID-19 patients
representing high (CT less than 20), intermediate (CT of 20 - 30), or low (CT of more than 30)
viral RNA loads by direct RT-qPCR. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy levels in these samples were
previously determined at UW by standard clinical RT-qPCR that included RNA extraction. To
address the potential impact of a prior heating step on detection sensitivity, NP swab samples were
heated or not for 10 min at 95°C prior to use in the downstream RNA extraction and/or direct RTqPCR. For each NP swab sample, a 3 µL volume of diluent was used for direct RT-qPCR. In
parallel, a 30 µL aliquot of each sample was used for RNA extraction and an equivalent of 3 µL
of the original swab diluent used for RT-qPCR, allowing for a one to one comparison with the

direct RT-qPCR method. To control for inhibitors of the RT or PCR enzymes and/or RNase
activity in the swab diluent, an aliquot of each swab diluent was spiked with 4 x 104 copies of EXO
control RNA for subsequent detection with an EXO primer-probe set; no inhibition was noted
under any of the tested conditions. Supplementary Table 1 shows the full results of this
experiment while Table 2 provides a summary. Fig. 2 shows the CT values from the original
clinical RT-qPCR done on the equivalent of 20 µL of NP swab diluent versus those obtained by
direct or standard RT-qPCR when measuring 3 µL (or equivalent) of swab diluent. There were
several key observations from this experiment. First, preheating NP swab samples prior to direct
RT-qPCR enhanced assay sensitivity (e.g. 138 of 150 samples were detected following a heat step,
compared with only 126 of 150 positive in the absence of preheating). Second, extraction of RNA
prior to RT-qPCR did not enhance detection of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples when an equivalent
amount of diluent was screened by direct RT-qPCR (138 of 150 samples were detected by each
approach). This suggests one of the primary advantages of kit-based RNA extraction comes from
concentrating the sample material so more RNA can be loaded into the RT-qPCR reaction. Third,
11 of the 12 samples not detected by direct RT-qPCR were from donors that had extremely low
loads of viral RNA as originally determined in the clinical test (CTs ranging from 33 to 38). Fourth,
preheating samples reduced sensitivity when using the Roche MagnaPure 96 RNA extraction
system, but had little effect on the direct RT-qPCR approach. Finally, the results from the EXO
spiking experiment indicate that the NP swab diluent does not inhibit the direct RT-qPCR assay.
Collectively, these results demonstrate that the direct RT-qPCR assay described here is capable of
reliably detecting the substantial majority of COVID-19 patients.
COVID-19 testing demands are currently overwhelming the world’s clinical laboratories. A major
chokepoint is the RNA extraction step, due to both the time and labor for this step and the critical
shortage of extraction kits and required reagents. As a means to circumvent these limitations on
clinical testing availability, we have shown that a direct RT-qPCR approach that omits an RNA
extraction step can effectively identify SARS-CoV-2 RNA from NP swabs. Further, direct RTqPCR is able to detect host RNA from NP swabs, which enables us to rule out false negatives due
to inadequate swabbing of patients resulting in a paucity of intact RNA in the specimen, or due to
the presence of inhibitors. When applied to a large collection of clinical NP specimens
representative of the range of COVID-19 patients in the state of Washington, the direct RT-qPCR
assay correctly identified 92% of the donors screened. The only donors that our simplified
approach missed were those with the very lowest load of viral RNA (and who were on the very
cusp of detection even when RNA extraction was used). Of the 1,872 cases with a positive
diagnosis at UW by our team at the time of this writing, only ~25% would fall into this low copy
range, which indicates that this assay will detect the substantial majority of COVID-19 patients.
Indeed, after we posted our initial results on bioRxiv 4, two additional groups posted preliminary
data on bioRxiv and medRxiv replicating these findings, using standard clinical diagnostic
methods in Chile and Denmark 6,7. The simplified approach we present here may be especially
well suited for general screening of the public and identification of “silent carrier” individuals.
Where resources permit, we envision that a two-step testing algorithm in which a repeat test
including RNA extraction could be applied for symptomatic patients, health care workers, and
others with a high index of suspicion but an initial negative result. Such a two-step strategy would
reduce the need for RNA extraction for a substantial portion of future COVID-19 tests.
Importantly, many testing sites in the developing world may not even have the capacity to perform

RNA extraction, but could easily run RT-qPCR reactions. This new approach would open up a
viable avenue for testing in these regions.
Methods
Samples
University of Vermont: Clinical nasopharyngeal swabs were collected in 3 ml M6 transport
medium. Patients were confirmed to be negative (3) or positive (6) for COVID-19 by the Vermont
Department of Health using the CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR
Diagnostic Panel 1. Limited quantities of this material were available, so we initially pooled equal
amounts of sample from two COVID-19 patients (Fig. 1a). Subsequently, four additional COVID19 confirmed patients and four COVID-19 negative donors were tested individually for the
presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA or RNase P by direct RT-qPCR of the sample material (Figs. 1bd).
University of Washington: Clinical nasopharyngeal swabs were collected in 3 mL of Universal
transport medium (UTM). 150 samples from patients confirmed to be COVID-19 positive by the
University of Washington Medical Laboratory with ranges of viral loads (CT values of SARSCoV-2 with the N2 primer from the original clinical test run at UW range from 10.17 to 38.13)
and sufficient volume were selected for this study (Fig. 2, Tables 1 and 2, and Supplementary
Table 1).
All patient samples at each testing site were stored at 4 oC in between sample collection and
transport to the laboratory, and again until clinical testing was carried out, maintaining a
standardized sample acquisition and processing protocol.
RNA Extraction
University of Vermont: To compare the effect of nucleic acid extraction to direct RT-PCR, RNA
from a pooled patient sample was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini (Qiagen, Cat. No.
52904) kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 140 µL of pooled nasopharyngeal swab
diluent was extracted and eluted in 60 µL; 5 µL (equivalent to 11 µL of original sample) was used
for real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 1a).
University of Washington: To compare the effect of nucleic acid extraction, RNA from 30 µL or
200 µL of patient sample was extracted using the Roche MagNA Pure 96 (Roche Lifesciences)
platform, eluted into 50 µL of buffer; 5 µL of RNA (equivalent to 3 µL of original sample for a 30
µL extraction) was used for real-time RT-PCR. To monitor RNA recovery and RT-PCR efficiency,
40,000 copies of EXO internal control RNA were added into the lysis buffer and went through the
extraction process with each sample (Fig. 2, Tables 1 and 2, and Supplementary Table 1).
RT-qPCR Detection
University of Vermont: In Fig. 1a, 7 µL of pooled nasopharyngeal swab diluent (heated to 70°C
for 5 minutes, or not), or 5 µL extracted RNA, was used as input material for the New England
Biolabs Luna Universal Probe One Step RT qPCR kit (Cat #E3006S, lot #10066679) according to
the IDT recommendation for primers/probe (1.5 µL primer/probe per reaction) using primer set

N3 from IDT’s 2019-nCoV CDC Emergency Use Authorization Kits (20 µL reaction).
Subsequently, in Figs. 1b-d, 3 µL of nasopharyngeal swab diluent was used as input material for
the ThermoFisher TaqPathTM 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG (Cat #A15299) using primer sets
N1, N2, and RP (human RNase P) from IDT’s CDC Emergency Use Authorization Kits (20 µL
reaction). Known copies of positive control RNA (CDC 2019-nCoV Positive Control in vitro
transcribed RNA for Fig. 1a; fully synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA Control 2 [Cat# MN908947.3,
Twist Bioscience] for Fig. 1b,c) were used to compare viral RNA quantities in patient samples.
Each patient sample, as well as no template control (water as well as M6 transport media) was run
in duplicate, the synthetic RNA standard was run in triplicate. The initial experiment was run on
an ABI QuantStudio 6 Flex (Fig. 1a), while subsequent experiments were run on an ABI 7500
Fast (Figs. 1b-d). Reagent preparations were performed in a PCR-free clean room equipped with
PCR workstations (AirClean Systems). Clinical sample manipulations (RNA extractions or direct
addition of NP swab diluent to RT-qPCR plates) were done in a Class IIA Biosafety Cabinet using
BSL-2 precautions. RT-qPCR plates were placed directly in biosafety waste at the conclusion of
each run.
University of Washington:
Fig. 2, Tables 1 and 2, and Supplementary Table 1: For each patient sample, 250 µL was heat
treated at 95oC for 10 minutes, or not. For direct RT-PCR, 3 µL of this sample, or 5 µL of extracted
RNA, was added directly into the RT-PCR reaction mixture. Each real-time RT-PCR reaction
contained 400 nM of CDC N2 forward and reverse primers and 100 nM of N2 probe. To monitor
potential RT-PCR inhibition, each RT-PCR reaction was spiked with 40,000 copies of EXO
internal control RNA and EXO primers (100 nM of EXO forward and 200 nM of EXO reverse)
and probes (62.5 nM). Real-time RT-PCR assays were performed using AgPath-ID One Step RTPCR kit (Life Technologies) and an ABI 7500 Real Time PCR system was used to perform the
RT-PCR reactions 8. For samples that were subjected to RNA extraction, 40,000 copies of EXO
RNA was spiked into the lysis buffer. Extraction efficiency for each sample was tracked based on
the percentage of the spiked EXO RNA that was detected by RT-qPCR. The primer-probe
sequences and RT-qPCR conditions for all methods used are below:

Fig. 1 | SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected from COVID-19 patient nasopharyngeal swabs
by RT-qPCR without an RNA extraction step
(a) Nasopharyngeal (NP) swab diluents from two confirmed COVID-19 patients were pooled, and
using the 2019-nCoV_N3 primer/probe set, the mixture was either i) subjected to RNA extraction
using the Qiagen QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit followed by subsequent testing by RT-qPCR (using
the equivalent of 11.3 ul swab diluent) or ii) directly added to the RT-qPCR reaction, with or
without a preheating step (five minutes at 70°C, “NP sample + heat”). As a control, the indicated
quantities of the CDC 2019-nCoV Positive Control SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA was spiked into
M6 transport media, purified using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit, and screened by RT-qPCR.
NP swab samples from seven additional donors were screened by direct RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV2 RNA using (b) the 2019-nCoV_N1 primer/probe set, (c) the 2019-nCoV_N2 primer/probe set,
or (d) for human RNase P RNA using the RP primer probe set. NP swab samples from donors 1 –
4 were previously shown to contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA by standard clinical RT-qPCR, while
donors 5 – 7 were negative. For each primer/probe set, 7 µL (a) or 3 µL (b, c, d) of NP swab
diluent was tested in the RT-qPCR reaction per donor. For the N1 and N2 primer probe sets, the
fully synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA Control 2 from Twist Bioscience was loaded at serial 10-fold
dilutions (A, 3x106 copies; B, 3x105 copies; C, 3x104 copies; D, 3x103 copies; E, 3x102 copies; F,
3x101 copies) as indicated in panels b and c. No template control (NTC) wells were included for
each primer/probe set and each was negative. For panels b and c, the correlation coefficients (R2)
of the standard curves were 0.999 and 0.995, respectively. The dashed line at cycle 40 in each
graph indicates the limit of detection.

Fig. 2 | Distribution of CT values from COVID-19 patient NP swabs following direct RTqPCR versus standard RT-qPCR that includes RNA extraction. 150 NP swab samples
representing high (CT values less than 20), intermediate (CT values of 20-30), or low (CT values
of more than 30) SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads as determined by standard clinical RT-qPCR at UW in
Seattle (aqua circles) were analyzed by the indicated method. All assays used the 2019-nCoV_N2
primer/probe set. Direct RT-qPCR was performed on 3 µL of NP swab diluent after heating for 10
minutes at 95°C (green circles). In parallel, RNA was extracted from 30 µL of NP swab diluent
that had been previously heated at 95°C for 10 minutes, and RNA representing 3 µL of the original
diluent was used in RT-qPCR (purple circles) to allow a head to head comparison to direct RTqPCR on the same quantity of NP swab diluent. The limit of detection (40 CT) is denoted with a
dashed line. Samples with CT values above this cutoff were considered negative for SARS-CoV2 RNA. The fitted curves are LOESS-smoothed (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) CT
values, with 95% confidence interval in gray, against the mean of CT values detected in the clinical
RT-qPCR assay with primer sets N1 & N2. Samples are ordered by the latter mean. The full data
set for this experiment and controls is provided in Supplementary Table 1.
