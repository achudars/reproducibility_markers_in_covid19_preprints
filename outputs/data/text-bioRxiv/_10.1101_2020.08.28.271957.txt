Abstract: A consensus virtual screening protocol has been applied to ca. 2000
approved drugs to seek inhibitors of the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, the
virus responsible for COVID-19. 42 drugs emerged as top candidates, and after visual
analyses of the predicted structures of their complexes with Mpro, 17 were chosen for
evaluation in a kinetic assay for Mpro inhibition. Remarkably 14 of the compounds at
100-μM concentration were found to reduce the enzymatic activity and 5 provided
IC50 values below 40 μM: manidipine (4.8 μM), boceprevir (5.4 μM), lercanidipine
(16.2 μM), bedaquiline (18.7 μM), and efonidipine (38.5 μM). Structural analyses
reveal a common cloverleaf pattern for the binding of the active compounds to the P1,
P1’, and P2 pockets of Mpro. Further study of the most active compounds in the
context of COVID-19 therapy is warranted, while all of the active compounds may
provide a foundation for lead optimization to deliver valuable chemotherapeutics to
combat the pandemic.

INTRODUCTION
SARS-CoV-2, the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic,1 is a coronavirus
(CoV) from the Coronaviridae family. Its RNA genome is ~82% identical to that of
SARS-CoV,2 which was responsible for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS) pandemic in 2003.3 SARS-CoV-2 encodes two cysteine proteases: the
chymotrypsin-like cysteine or main protease, known as 3CLpro or Mpro, and the
papain-like cysteine protease, PLpro. They catalyze the proteolysis of polyproteins
translated from the viral genome into non-structural proteins essential for packaging
the nascent virion and viral repication.4 Therefore, inhibiting the activity of these
proteases would impede the replication of the virus. Mpro processes the polyprotein
1ab at multiple cleavage sites. It hydrolyzes the Gln-Ser peptide bond in the Leu-GlnSer-Ala-Gly recognition sequence. This cleavage site in the substrate is distinct from
the peptide sequence recognized by other human cysteine proteases known to date.5
Thus, Mpro is viewed as a promising target for anti SARS-CoV-2 drug design; it has
been the focus of several studies since the pandemic has emerged. 2,4–7
An X-ray crystal structure of Mpro reveals that it forms a homodimer with a 2fold crystallographic symmetry axis.2,5 Each protomer, with a length of 306 residues,
is made of three domains (I-III). Domains II and I fold into a six-stranded β-barrel
that harbors the active site.2,4,5 Domain III forms a cluster of five antiparallel αhelices that regulates the dimerization of the protease. A flexible loop connects
domain II to domain III. The Mpro active site contains a Cys-His catalytic dyad and
canonical binding pockets that are denoted P1, P1, P2, P3, and P4.2 The amino acid
sequence of the active site is highly conserved among coronaviruses.8 The catalytic
dyad residues are His41 and Cys145 and the residues playing key roles in the binding

of the substrate are Phe140, His163, Met165, Glu166, and Gln189 (Figure 1). These
residues have been found to interact with the ligands co-crystallized with Mpro in
different studies.2,4,5 Crystallographic data also suggested that Ser1 of one protomer
interacts with Phe140 and Glu166 of the other as the result of dimerization.2,4 These
interactions stabilize the P1 binding pocket, thereby, dimerization of the main
protease is likely for its catalytic activity.2,4
Drug repurposing is an important strategy for immediate response to the
COVID-19 pandemic.9 In this approach, the main goal of computational and
experimental studies has been to find existing drugs that might be effective against
SARS-CoV-2. For instance, a molecular docking study suggested remdesivir as a
potential therapeutic that could be used against SARS-CoV-2,10 which was supported
experimentally by an EC50 value of 23 μM in an infected-cell assay.11 However, a
clinical trial showed no statistically significant clinical benefits of remdesivir on

adult patients hospitalized for severe COVID-19.12 Nonetheless, patients who were
administered remdesivir in the same trial showed a faster time to clinical
improvement in comparison to the placebo-control group.12 In another clinical trial,
only patients on mechanical ventilation benefitted from remdesivir.13 An EC50 value
of 27 μM was also reported for lopinavir11, suggesting it may have beneficial activity
against SARS-CoV-2. However, neither lopinavir nor the lopinavir/ritonavir
combination has thus far shown any significant benefits against COVID-19 in
clinical trials. Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and favipiravir have also been
explored for repurposing against COVID-19; however, clinical studies with them
have been controversial.14–17 These studies reflect the urgent need for systematic drug
discovery efforts for therapies effective against SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we decided to pursue discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of Mpro.
The aim of this initial work was two-fold: to identify known drugs that may show
some activity, but also to identify structurally promising, synthetically-accessible
substructures suitable for subsequent lead optimization. Our expectation was that
existing drugs may show activity but not at the low-nanomolar levels that are typical
of effective therapies. This report provides results for the first goal. The work began
by designing and executing a consensus molecular docking protocol to virtual screen
~2000 approved drugs. The predicted structures (poses) of the complexes for the topscoring 42 drugs received extensive scrutiny including consideration of
intermolecular contacts, conformation, stability in molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations, and potential for synthetic modification to arrive at 17 drugs, which
were purchased and assayed for inhibition of Mpro. The outcome was strikingly
successful with 14 of the 17 compounds showing some reduction of Mpro activity at
100 μM concentration, and with 5 compounds yielding IC50 values below 40 μM.

The most potent inhibitors of Mpro identified here, manidipine and boceprevir, have
IC50 values of 4.8 and 5.4 μM, respectively.

COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH
Selection of the Crystal Structure of Mpro. Our analyses of more than 50
crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 main protease in apo and holo forms showed small
structural variations in the active site region. The overall root mean square deviation
(RMSD) of all structures was ~0.8 Å for Cα atoms. The presence of a ligand in the
crystal structure likely places the side chains of the active site residues in positions
that are more suitable for performing molecular docking compared to the apo form of
the enzyme. Thus, we chose to use a high-resolution (1.31 Å) structure of Mpro cocrystalized with a non-covalent small fragment hit (PDB ID 5R82)18 for docking the
approved drugs after removal of the fragment (Figure 1). The program Reduce19 was
run on the structure for allowing side-chain flips, optimizing hydrogen bonds, and
adding/removing hydrogen atoms. The pKa values of the ionizable residues of Mpro
were predicted using the PROPKA320 and the H++ severs.21,22 Accordingly, lysines
and arginines were positively charged, aspartic and glutamic acids were negatively
charged, and all histidines were neutral. All histidines were built with the proton on
Nε except for His80, which was protonated at Nδ. The resulting Mpro structure has a
net charge of -4 e. Extensive visual inspection was carried out using UCSF Chimera.23
Consensus Molecular Docking. Most docking programs apply methods to
generate an initial set of conformations, and tautomeric and protonation states for
each ligand. This is followed by application of search algorithms and scoring
functions to generate and score the poses of the ligand in the binding site of a protein.
Scoring functions have been trained to reproduce a finite set of experimental ligand-

binding affinities that are generally a mix of activity data converted to a free-energy
scale. Therefore, the accuracy of the scores is dependent on multiple factors including
the compounds that were part of the training set. To mitigate the biases, we performed
four independent runs of protein-ligand docking with a library of ca. 2000 approved,
oral drugs using Glide, AutoDock Vina, and two protocols with AutoDock 4.2. The
results were compiled and further consideration focused on those compounds that
ranked among the top 10% percent in at least 3 out of the 4 runs.
Glide. Schrödinger’s Protein Prep wizard utility was used for preparing the
protein. A 20-Å grid was then generated and centered on the co-crystallized ligand,
which was subsequently removed. The drug library members were neutralized and/or
ionized via Schrödinger’s LigPrep.24 The Epik program25 was used for estimating the
pKa values of each compound. Plausible tautomers and stereoisomers within the pH
range of 7 ± 1 were generated for each compound using the OPLS3 force field.26
These conditions resulted in a total of 16000 structures, which were then docked into
Mpro using Schrödinger’s standard-precision (SP) Glide.27,28
AutoDock. The AutoDockTools (ADT) software29 was used for creating
PDBQT files from SDF and PDB files of compounds and the protein, respectively.
Non-polar hydrogen atoms were removed and Gasteiger–Marsili charges were
assigned for both the protein and the ligands using ADT. The AutoGrid 4.2 program29
was used for generating affinity grids with a spacing of 0.375 Å and with a box size
of 74 × 80 × 62 Å. The affinity grids were centered at two different points of the
active site for performing two sets of runs. In the first run, the grid box was centered
at Cβ of Cys145 of monomer A. In the second run, the grid center was displaced
toward the geometric center of the active site. The AutoDock 4.2 program29 was
applied for docking the ligands into Mpro. The Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA)

was used for ligand conformational searching. LGA was iterated 15 and 50 times in
the first and the second run, respectively, for each compound. The maximum RMS
tolerance for conformational cluster analysis was 2.0 and 0.5 Å in the first and second
runs, respectively. The number of generations was set to 27000 with 300 individuals
in each population in both runs. The maximum number of energy evaluations was 30
× 106 for all compounds and 40 × 106 for re-docking of the selected consensus
compounds. Other parameters were set to their default values.
AutoDock Vina. The PDBQT files generated by ADT for the protein and
library compounds also used for running AutoDock Vina.30 Non-polar hydrogen
atoms were removed. An affinity grid box with a size of 18 × 21 × 18 Å was
generated and centered on the active site. The default docking parameters were used,
except for the number of modes that was set to 9.
Molecular Dynamics Simulations. The GROMACS software, version 2018a
compiled in double precision, was used for performing all molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations.31 The protonated Mpro dimer, with a net charge of -8 e, was represented
by the OPLS-AA/M force field.32 TIP4P water was used as the solvent.33 Sodium
counterions were added to neutralize the net charge of each system. The selected
ligand candidates were represented by the OPLS/CM1A force field,34 as assigned by
the BOSS software35 (version 4.9) and the LigParGen Python code.36 The parameters
were converted to GROMACS format using LigParGen.36 For neutral ligands, the
CM1A partial atomic charges were scaled by a factor of 1.14.34
Each Mpro-ligand complex was put at the center of a triclinic simulation box
with 10-Å padding. An energy minimization was then performed until the steepest
descent algorithm converged to a maximum force smaller than 2.4 kcal mol-1 Å-1. A
cutoff radius of 12 Å was used to explicitly calculate non-bonded interactions. Long-

range electrostatic interactions were treated using the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME)
algorithm.37 The PME was used with an interpolation order of 4, a Fourier spacing of
1.2 Å, and a relative tolerance of 10-6. The van der Waals forces were smoothly
switched to zero between 10 and 12 Å. Analytical corrections to the long-range effect
of dispersion interactions were applied to both energy and pressure. All covalent
bonds to hydrogen atoms were constrained at their equilibrium lengths using the
LINCS algorithm38 with the order of 12 in the expansion of the constraint-coupling
matrix. Each system was subsequently simulated for 1 ns in the canonical ensemble
(NVT) in order for the solvent to relax and the temperature of the system to
equilibrate. Initial velocities were sampled from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at
310 K. The V-rescale thermostat with a stochastic term39 was used for keeping the
temperature at 310 K. The stochastic term ensured that the sampled ensemble was
canonical.39 The coupling constant of the thermostat was set to 2.0 ps. The system
was then equilibrated for 1.5 ns in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble (NPT) for
obtaining a density consistent with the reference pressure. The pressure was kept at 1
bar by the Berendsen barostat40 with a coupling constant of 4.0 ps and a
compressibility factor of 4.5 × 10-5 bar. A harmonic position restraint with a force
constant of 2.4 kcal mol-1 Å-2 was applied to the protein backbone and to all solute
heavy atoms during the equilibration steps. A 70 ns unrestrained run was then
performed in the NPT ensemble with the Parrinello−Rahman barostat41 using a
coupling time of 4.0 ps.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
Expression and Purification of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. A PGEX-6p-1 vector
containing the gene for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro harboring a His6 tag followed by a
modified PreScission cleavage site was used to produce recombinant protein.5
Recombinant Mpro with authentic N- and C-termini was expressed and purified as
previously described.5
Kinetic Assays of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro Activity and Analysis. All assayed
compounds were obtained from commercial sources except cinnoxicam, which had to
be synthesized, and had purity >95% based on HPLC analysis. Kinetics of SARSCoV-2 Mpro were measured as previously described.5,7 Briefly, 100 nM Mpro in
reaction buffer (20mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.3) was incubated with
or without compound in DMSO at varying concentrations to a final DMSO
concentration of 6% for 15 minutes with shaking at room temperature. The reaction
was initiated by addition of substrate (Dabcyl-KTSAVLQ↓SGFRKM-E(Edans-NH2);
GL Biochem) in reaction buffer, which is cleaved by Mpro, generating a product
containing a free Edans group. Fluorescence was monitored at an excitation
wavelength of 360 nm and emission wavelength of 460 nm. All measurements were
performed in triplicate and averaged. IC50 plots and values were generated using
Prism 8.0 (GraphPad).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Virtual Screening. The docking scores obtained for all compounds range
from -10.85 to -0.59 for Glide, from -12.33 to -2.30 for AutoDock run 1, from -10.74
to -0.40 for AutoDock run 2, and -8.50 to -2.10 for AutoDock Vina. As expected, the
range of scores is wide and it is different from one docking program to another. The

complete list of compounds and docking scores is provided in the SI. Compounds
were ranked based on their docking scores and the top 200 hits from the four docking
runs were compared. As the result, 42 compounds with a consensus count of 4 or 3
were selected. This means that these compounds were among the top-200 ranked
compounds in all 4 or at least 3 out of the 4 docking runs. The indications and
mechanisms of action for the 42 drugs are shown in Table 1, and the structures of
some of the ones that turned out to be most interesting are shown in Figure 2. The
primary indications include bacterial and viral infections, hypertension, psychosis,
inflammation, and cancer. Their mechanisms of action are also broad ranging from
kinase and protease inhibitors to dopamine receptors agonists/antagonists, and
calcium channel blockers. It is not surprising that peptidic protease inhibitors are
well-represented in view of the peptide substrate and prior discovery of peptidic
inhibitors for Mpro and its SARS-CoV relative. 7,42,43
In almost all cases the predicted poses for the 42 compounds from the
different docking programs agreed well. The poses from Glide were then subjected to
extensive visual scrutiny to check for unsatisfied hydrogen-bonding sites,
electrostatic mismatches, and unlikely conformation of the ligand. About half of the
compounds were ruled out for further study due to the occurrence of such liabilities
and the presence of multiple ester groups (e.g., methoserpidine and nicomol) or
overall size and complexity (e.g., bromocriptine and benzquercin). A repeated motif
was apparent with high-scoring ligands having a cloverleaf pattern with occupancy of
the P1, P1’, and P2 pockets, as illustrated in Figure 3 for the complex of azelastine.
Other common elements are an edge-to-face aryl-aryl interaction with His41 and
placement of a positively-charged group in the P1 pocket in proximity to Glu166,
e.g., the methylazepanium group of azelastine, the protonated trialkylamino group of

bedaquiline, and protonated piperazine of periciazine. However, Glu166 forms a saltbridge with the terminal ammonium group Ser1B (Figure 1). The electrostatic balance
seems unclear in this region, so our final selections included a mix of neutral and
positively-charged groups for the P1 site.
The analysis of the high-scoring 42 compounds also considered structural
variety and potential synthesis of analogs. In the end, we settled on 17 compounds,
which are highlighted in Table 1, for purchase and assaying. Sixteen were
commercially available, mostly from Sigma-Aldrich. The seventeenth, cinnoxicam,
was not available, but it was readily prepared in a one-step synthesis from the
commercially-available ester components. It may be noted that three calcium channel
blockers, efonidipine, lercanidipine, and manidipine were purchased (Figure 2). This
was not done owing to the characteristic dihydropyridine substructure, since this end
of the molecule protrudes out of the P1’ site in the docked poses. It was for the
variety in the left-sides of the molecules in Figure 2, which form the cloverleaf that
binds in the P1, P1’, and P2 pockets, as illustrated in Figure 4 for manidipine. The
steric fit in this region appears good, though the only potential hydrogen bond is
between the nitro group and the catalytic Cys145.

Protease Assay Results. The 17 known drugs were screened using the FRETbased assay monitoring the fluorescence generated from the cleavage of a peptide
substrate harboring an Edans-Dabcyl pair by recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
Remarkably, fourteen of the drugs at 100 μM decreased Mpro activity (100 nM), as
shown in Figure 5 and Table 2. Five drugs decreased Mpro activity to below 40%. The
top five hits from the kinetic assay were manidipine, boceprevir, efonidipine,
lercanidipine, and bedaquiline. Dose-response curves were obtained to determine IC50
values, when possible, as shown in Figure 6 for the five most potent inhibitors, with
the raw data as a function of time and concentration given in Figure S1.
The calcium channel-blockers manidipine, lercanidipine, and efonidipine
inhibit Mpro activity with IC50 values of 4.8 μM, 16.2 μM, and 38.5 μM, respectively.
As suggested from Figure 4, the variation likely arises primarily from differences in
binding of the left sides of the molecules (Figure 2) in the P1, P1’, and P2 pockets. It
has previously been proposed that such compounds might be useful for treatment of
SARS-CoV-2 infection for their role as calcium channel blockers, not as Mpro
inhibitors.44 Boceprevir, a hepatitis C virus protease inhibitor, inhibits Mpro with an
IC50 of 5.4 μM; its IC50 has been previously reported as 4.13 μM.7 Bedaquiline,
approved for the treatment of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, inhibits Mpro with an
IC50 of 18.7 μM. The IC50 of nelfinavir, an HIV protease inhibitor, was estimated to
be between 250 and 600 μM. Vatansever et al. have previously reported an IC50 for
nelfinavir of 234 μM.45 Perampanel appears to be the sixth most active compound at
100 μM, though its IC50 could not be calculated reliably, as its intrinsic fluorescence
interfered with the fluorescence measurements.
The computed structures for the complexes of boceprevir and bedaquiline are
illustrated in Figure 7. For boceprevir, the dimethylcyclopropyl subunit is predicted to

respectively, while the quinoline fragment extends towards the solvent, and there are

that positively-charged groups may be acceptable in the P1 site.
MD Analyses for the Mpro-ligand Complexes. Before the assaying was
carried out, the 70-ns MD simulations were run for complexes of 14 of the promising
compounds starting from the Glide poses. The idea was to obtain insight on which
compounds gave more stable complexes and were, therefore expected to be more
active inhibitors. In addition to visualization of the evolving structures, the all-atom
RMSD of each ligand was computed over the course of the simulation time with and
without least-square (LS) fitting of the ligand’s atoms onto the initial orientation of
the complex (Figure 8). The LS-fit RMSD monitors only the ligand’s conformational
changes, whereas the no-fit RMSD also reflects rotational and translational
movements. The LS-fit RMSD converged relatively quickly to 2-3 Å for all ligands,
except for carindacillin, which converged to 4 Å. However, as expected, no-fit RMSD
values are larger than the LS-fit RMSD values for all ligands, demonstrating the
contribution of rotational and translational movements. The no-fit RMSD value
converged for bedaquiline, idarubicin, indinavir, and perampanel after about 10 ns,
while it converged for efonidpine after 60 ns. The no-fit RMSD values steadily
fluctuated about an average value of 4 Å for lapatinib and periciazine. In general,
most ligands showed some displacement from their initial position, whereas they
remained close to their initial conformation. Clear correlation of the results with the
measured activities is not obvious, perhaps because 70 ns is too short a timeframe.
For example, the RMSDs for bedaquiline and perampanel converge well, while they
are more erratic for the more active boceprevir and efonidipine. More sophisticated
MD procedures for gauging stability are known such as metadynamics, steered-MD,

to the present experimental results.

CONCLUSIONS
The present virtual screening study was highly successful in identifying 14
known drugs as showing inhibitory effect on the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The
consensus scoring approach using three docking programs and four protocols was
effective in narrowing down ca. 2000 candidate drugs to 42 of high interest. The final
17 compounds that were selected for assay did reflect additional human visualization
and analyses, though assaying of all 42 top compounds would not be burdensome.
Five compounds were identified with IC50 values below 40 μM with manidipine,

boceprevir, lercanidipine, and bedaquiline having values of 4.8, 5.4, 16.2, and 18.7
μM. Further study of these compounds in the context of COVID-19 therapy is
warranted, while all of the active compounds reported here may provide a foundation
for lead optimization to deliver valuable chemotherapeutics to combat the pandemic.
