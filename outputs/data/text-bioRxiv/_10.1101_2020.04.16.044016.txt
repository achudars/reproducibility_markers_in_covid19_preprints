Abstract
The emergence of novel SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 has triggered an
ongoing global pandemic of severe pneumonia-like disease designated as coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19). To date, more than 2.1 million confirmed cases and
139,500 deaths have been reported worldwide, and there are currently no medical
countermeasures available to prevent or treat the disease. As the development of a
vaccine could require at least 12-18 months, and the typical timeline from hit finding to
drug registration of an antiviral is >10 years, repositioning of known drugs can
significantly accelerate the development and deployment of therapies for COVID-19. To
identify therapeutics that can be repurposed as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, we profiled a
library of known drugs encompassing approximately 12,000 clinical-stage or FDAapproved small molecules. Here, we report the identification of 30 known drugs that
inhibit viral replication. Of these, six were characterized for cellular dose-activity
relationships, and showed effective concentrations likely to be commensurate with
therapeutic doses in patients. These include the PIKfyve kinase inhibitor Apilimod,
cysteine protease inhibitors MDL-28170, Z LVG CHN2, VBY-825, and ONO 5334, and
the CCR1 antagonist MLN-3897. Since many of these molecules have advanced into
the clinic, the known pharmacological and human safety profiles of these compounds
will accelerate their preclinical and clinical evaluation for COVID-19 treatment.

Introduction
In December 2019, the novel SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified
as the causative agent of a severe pneumonia-like coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
outbreak in Wuhan in the Hubei province of China1. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped,
positive-sense, single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus, related to the viruses that caused
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome
(MERS) in 2002-2004 and 2012-present, respectively. The World Health Organization
(WHO) declared the rapidly spreading disease a pandemic on March 11th, 2020, and, as
of April 16th, more than 2.1 million confirmed cases and 139,500 deaths have been
recorded worldwide in 213 countries2. The WHO estimates the global case fatality rate
(CFR) at 3.4% of those infected, though the number of actual infections is likely much
higher than the number of reported cases3,4. Typical COVID-19 symptoms include fever,
cough, anosmia, headache, anorexia, myalgia, and, in the most severe cases, viralinduced pneumonia accompanied by prolonged and systemic cytokine release5,6.
Notably, the levels of IL-6 have been reported to correlate with respiratory failure, and
inhibitors are currently being pursued in clinical studies for the amelioration of virusinduced inflammatory responses7. Patients with pre-existing chronic conditions such as
hypertension, diabetes, and asthma, as well as those 65 years or older, are at a higher
risk of severe disease outcome8. The underlying basis for these differential outcomes is
yet unknown. Together, the still accelerating rate of community transmission and
severity of the symptoms have placed an unprecedented burden on the medical supply
chain and health care system in Italy, Spain, and the U.S.9-11, with similar scenarios
playing out or anticipated in other countries.
While the FDA has recently granted the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine
sulfate (also known as hydroxychloroquine) emergency use authorization (EUA) for
COVID-19 treatment, at present, there is no vaccine or approved antiviral therapeutic
agent available12. Thus, there is an urgent and critical need to identify novel medical
countermeasures both for prophylactic and treatment use. Since the production of a
vaccine could take 12-18 months13, and de novo development of therapies usually
requires 10-17 years14, repositioning clinically evaluated drugs represents one of the

most practicable strategies for the rapid identification and deployment of treatments for
emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19.
Toward this end, in addition to many anti-immune treatments not addressed in
this paper, many investigational clinical trials using repurposed drugs for evaluation of
direct antiviral activity have already been launched. Those include multiple antiviral and
antimalarial medicines. Early results of a multicenter trial in China suggested that the
antimalarial drug, chloroquine, may limit exacerbation of pneumonia and shorten viral
replication and course of disease15. A French study that used hydroxychloroquine
together with azithromycin reported a significant reduction in viral load in COVID-19
patients when used in combination16. However, a sufficiently powered case-control
study has not yet been reported, and thus it is unclear if there are therapeutic benefits of
chloroquine administration to SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, although several concerns
are being raised recently, due to the severe cardiac complications potentially resulting
from the use of this treatment in COVID-19 patients17,18.
The repurposing of several approved antiviral therapies have all been the focus
of clinical investigations, including HIV-1 protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra,
Aluvia by AbbVie)19, hepatitis C virus protease inhibitor danoprevir (Ganovo, Ascletis
Pharma)20, and the influenza antiviral favipiravir (T-705, Avigan)21. Most notably, ten
clinical trials at more than 50 global sites are underway to investigate remdesivir (GS5734), an investigational antiviral originally developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola
virus infection22. Remdesivir, an adenosine analogue, is a viral RNA polymerase
inhibitor that causes premature termination of transcription when incorporated into
nascent viral RNA23. The drug has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity in animal
models against both MERS and SARS24,25, as well as potent antiviral activity in Vero E6
against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-226. Pending results of several randomized
(n = 308) clinical trials are expected to provide definitive insight into the efficacy of
remdesivir as a therapeutic solution for the treatment of COVID-19. However, a wellpowered randomized controlled trial has yet to demonstrate definitive evidence of
antiviral efficacy for remdesivir or any other potential therapeutic.
While these targeted repurposing strategies provide potentially rapid trajectories
toward an approved treatment, an unbiased large-scale evaluation of known drugs and

clinical candidates can identify additional unanticipated therapeutic options with
accelerated evaluation for the treatment of COVID-19 disease. Here, we describe a

pharmacologically active compounds LOPAC®1280 and the ReFRAME (Repurposing,
Focused Rescue, and Accelerated Medchem) drug collection, a comprehensive openaccess library of ~12,000 clinical-staged or approved small molecules respectively, to
identify existing drugs that harbor antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in a cell-based
assay27,28. The ReFRAME library has previously been used to successfully identify the
anti-inflammatory auranofin as a potential therapy for tuberculosis29, the approved drug
clofazimine as a potent antiparasitic compound that is now being tested for efficacy
against Cryptosporidium30, and has also been used to identify and optimize the FDAapproved antifungal drug itraconazole as a novel efficacious molecule suitable for
chronic administration as an anti-fibrotic31. Importantly, the ReFRAME library is unique
in that it is the only repurposing collection we are aware of where nearly 50% of the
library was derived from custom synthesis, as commercially available sources of these
clinical molecules were not available32. Each of the molecules in this collection has been
previously optimized for efficacy, safety, and bioavailability. Therefore, this enables
leveraging of the considerable investment in research and development to compress
the timeline required for drug discovery and development33. For example, repositioning
is estimated to reduce the typical 10-17 year development process to 3-12 years34, and
under emergency use authorization (EUA) for chemical, biological, radiological, and
nuclear (CBRN) threats during public health emergencies, such as the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic, this may be abbreviated to a <6-month time frame.
Here, we describe a high-throughput analysis of the ReFRAME library to identify
inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication in mammalian cells, and identified several targets
and mechanistic classes that were highly enriched, including aldose reductase
inhibitors, retinoic acid receptor antagonists, benzodiazepine receptor agonists,
regulators of cholesterol homeostasis and antimalarial compounds. Validation studies
further confirmed 30 known drugs to inhibit viral replication, including four molecules
previously approved by the FDA (clofazimine, acitretin, tretinoin, and astemizole) or
registered outside the US (tamibarotene). Dose response studies have thus far

characterized 7 compounds that exhibit a range of effective concentrations (EC50) that
are consistent with potential clinical efficacy. These include a PIKfyve kinase inhibitor
that has reached Phase II clinical trials (Apilimod), and cysteine protease inhibitors
(MDL-28170, Z LVG CHN2, VBY-825, and ONO 5334) that are in various phases of
preclinical and clinical development. In addition, the preclinical ion channel blocker
AMG-2674 and the ion channer blocker and antimalarial drug hanfangchin A, the phase
I proton pump inhibitor YH-1238, as well as the G-protein receptor antagonists MLN3897 and SDZ-62-43435, which are in phase II and phase I clinical evaluation
respectively, were also found to possess antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Rapid
experimental and clinical evaluation of these therapeutics for in vivo antiviral efficacy
and amelioration of disease-associated pathologies can provide an important
opportunity for the accelerated development of potential therapies for COVID-19
treatment.
Materials and Methods
Cells and Viruses
SARS-CoV-2 HKU-001a strain was isolated from the nasopharyngeal aspirate
specimen of a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patient in Hong Kong36. SARS-CoV-2
USA-WA1/2020 strain, isolated from an oropharyngeal swab from a patient with a
respiratory illness who developed clinical disease (COVID-19) in January 2020 in
Washington, USA, was obtained from BEI Resources (NR-52281). The virus was
propagated in Vero E6 (ATCC® CRL-1586™) cells transfected with exogenous human
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and stored at −80 °C in aliquots. Plaque forming unit (PFU) and
TCID50 assays were performed to titrate the cultured virus. Vero E6 and Huh-7 cells
(Apath LLC, Brooklyn) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM,
Gibco) supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco),
50 U/mL penicillin, 50 µg/mL streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 10 mM
HEPES (Gibco), and 1X MEM non-essential amino acids solution (Gibco). Huh-7 cells
were transfected with PLVX-ACE2 and PLX304-TMPRSS2 prior to infection. All
experiments involving live SARS-CoV-2 followed the approved standard operating

Administration (FDA)-approved/registered drugs (~35 %), investigational new drugs

Drug screening
Compounds from the LOPAC®1280 and ReFRAME library were transferred into FBOTTOM, µCLEAR®, BLACK 384-well plates (Greiner) using an Echo 550 Liquid
Handler (Labcyte). All compounds were diluted in culture media to a final concentration
of 5 µM during screening. Briefly, Vero E6 cells were seeded in 384-well plates, on top
of pre-spotted compounds, at a density of 3,000 cells per well in 40 µl using a
microFlo™ select dispenser (BioTek Instruments). Sixteen hours post-seeding, the cells
were infected by adding 10 µl of SARS-CoV-2 per well at an MOI of 0.01. Cytopathic
effect (CPE) was indirectly quantified as the presence of ATP in live cells by using the
CellTiter-Glo (Promega) luminescent cell viability assay at 72 hours post-infection. Data
were normalized to the median of each plate. For the ReFRAME library, the Z-score
was calculated based on the log2FC with the average and standard deviation of each
plate. The screen was performed in duplicate by running the assay in parallel for the
LOPAC®1280 library or as two independent experiments for the ReFRAME collection.
Twenty-eight compounds from the LOPAC®1280 were selected according to the cutoff
of >5*Stdev Log2FC and included in a dose-response confirmation assay. Compounds

from the ReFRAME collection were ranked according to their Z-score. The top 100 hits
from each replicate were selected (25 overlapping). Seventy-five additional hits were
chosen according to their ranking based on the average Z-score. The last 48 hits were
selected according to drug target and pathway enrichment analysis. The 298 prioritized
hits were included in a dose-response confirmation assay.
Dose Response Curves, EC50 Calculations, and Orthogonal Validation
The selected hits were further validated by immunofluorescence in an 8-point dose
response experiment to determine EC50 and CC50 through a cell-based high-content
imaging assay, labeling the viral nucleoproteins within infected cells. Three thousand
Vero E6 cells were added into 384-well plates pre-spotted with compounds, in a volume
of 40 µl. The final concentration of compound ranged from 1.1 nM to 2.5 µM. Sixteen
hours post-seeding, 10 µl of SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 were added to each well, at
an MOI of 0.75. Twenty-four hours post-infection, cells were fixed with 5 %
paraformaldehyde for 4 hours and permeabilized with 0.5 % Triton X-100 for 5 min.
After blocking with 3 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min, the cells were
incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with rabbit-anti-SARS-CoV-1 nucleoprotein
serum, which exhibits strong cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2. After two washes with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) for 1 hour at room
temperature. After two additional washes, PBS supplemented with 0.1 µg/ml antifade-4
6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (BioLegend, USA) was added to the cells for at least
30 min before imaging. Images were acquired using the Celigo Image Cytometer
(Nexcelom). The assay results and data analysis enabled us to determine infectivity and
viability/cytotoxicity. Based on all infectivity and cytotoxicity values, a 4-parameter
logistic non-linear regression model was used to calculate EC50 and CC50 concentration
values.
Enrichment analysis
Compounds were annotated in the three databases used to assemble the ReFRAME
library (Clarivate Integrity, GVK Excelra GoStar and Citeline Pharmaprojects) according

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.16.044016; this version posted April 17, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

to a variety of properties, including targets, pathways, indications, and mechanisms of
actions (MOA). Each annotation property was tested for enrichment among the
screening hits using the GSEA software38,39. The compounds annotated for each
property were treated as a “gene set”. For each set of vendor annotations, the
background compound set was defined as the set of compounds annotated for any
property by that vendor. Enrichment results at p < 0.05 and FDR q-value < 0.25 were
defined as significant. Additional enrichment analyses were performed using the free
online meta-analysis tool Metascape40.
Expression analysis
Gene expression analysis was conducted using single-cell RNA profiling data of
samples from four macro-anatomical locations of human airway epithelium in healthy
living volunteers41. For each gene, the fraction of cells with non-zero expression values
was calculated in nasal, tracheal, intermediate, and distal samples from multiple donors.
Values for each sampling location were averaged across donors. To analyze gene
expression levels in different cell types, the fractions of cells with non-zero expression
values were determined in all cells of a given cell type across samples. Cell types with a
total of less than 250 cells detected were excluded from analysis. Clustered heat maps
were generated in R using the pheatmap and viridis packages.

Results
Optimization of a high-throughput screen for inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2
Replication. One of the most efficient ways to identify antiviral candidates against an
emergent virus, such as SARS-CoV-2, that can be rapidly evaluated in clinical trials is to
repurpose clinically assessed drugs. Given the urgent need for therapeutics to treat
SARS-CoV-2 infection, we developed a high-throughput assay to screen a
comprehensive repurposing library. Vero E6 cells, kidney epithelial cells derived from an
African green monkey, have been shown to be highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2
infection42 and viral replication can be assessed through measurement of viral-induced
cytopathic effects (CPE)43. A clinical isolate of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (SARS-CoV-2

HKU-001a)36 was utilized for assay development and screening. The assay parameters,
including cell seeding density, multiplicity of infection (MOI), and timepoints, were
optimized in Vero E6 cells by measuring virus-induced CPE using CellTiter-glo, which
quantifies cellular ATP levels, in a 384-well format. Maximal dynamic range and
reproducibility were found at conditions of 3,000 cells/well, infection at an MOI of 0.01,
and CPE measurement at 72 hours post-infection (Figure 1A; data not shown).
In an effort to assess robustness and reproducibility of the optimized assay in a
high-throughput screening (HTS) configuration, we initially evaluated the assay utilizing
the collection of 1,280 known bioactive molecules LOPAC®1280. Upon initiation of the
screening effort, a compound with activity against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells had not
been reported. Based on studies that indicate that inhibition of the PIKfyve kinase
inhibits low pH-dependent entry of viruses such as Ebola44,45, we evaluated the potential
antiviral activity of the PIKfyve kinase inhibitor APY0201 against SARS-CoV-2.
Compared to vehicle (DMSO), cells dosed with 1 µM APY0201 harbored a 2.5X
increase in cell viability, reflecting reduced CPE after viral challenge, which was
comparable to the non-infected control (Figure 1B, left panel). These data confirmed
the antiviral activity of APY0201 against SARS-CoV-2 and enabled us to establish a
reliable dynamic range based on the activity of a positive control. Vero E6 cells were
seeded in 384-well plates with pre-spotted compounds from the LOPAC®1280 library at
a 5 µM (final) concentration. After 16 hours, cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2
(MOI = 0.01) in the presence of compound, and at 72 hours post-infection CPE induced
by the virus was quantified through previously described measurement of cell viability.
Duplicates of each plate were run in parallel and the value corresponding to each well
was normalized to the median of each plate and used to calculate the log base 2 of the
fold change (Log2FC). Based on the activity of APY0201, the average Zʹ factor for the
5 plates in duplicate was 0.4, and the correlation coefficient for the duplicates (R2) was
0.81 (Figure 1B), although an usual distribution of the positive controls in the correlation
plot was observed. Twenty-eight compounds were selected for further study based on
activities in both screens. These included the HIV protease inhibitor nelfinavir mesylate
hydrate, the calpain and cathepsin B inhibitor MDL28170 and the antagonist of the
serotonin receptors 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D GR 127935 hydrochloride hydrate, which have

all been shown to efficiently block either SARS-CoV-1 or 2 infection in vitro or in vivo4650

, thus assessing the sensitivity of our screening conditions in identifying compounds

with known antiviral activity (Figure 1B, top right middle panel).
Repositioning analysis of the ReFRAME Drug Repurposing Library. Since the
results of the LOPAC®1280 HTS analysis indicated that these assay conditions were
suitable to progress to a large-scale screen, we used this experimental design to screen
the comprehensive ReFRAME drug repurposing collection. This library is an inclusive
collection of nearly 12,000 chemical compounds, that have been either FDA-approved
or registered outside the US, entered clinical trials, or undergone significant pre-clinical
characterization27. Specifically, 11,987 compounds were arrayed in 384-well plates at a
final concentration of 5 µM. As with the previous assay, Vero E6 cells were seeded into
each well pre-spotted with compound, infected 16 h later with SARS-CoV-2
(MOI = 0.01) and at 72 hours post-infection, CPE was determined. Analysis of the
average Zʹ factor calculated on the activity of APY0201 was determined to be 0.51,
reflecting an acceptable assay dynamic range (Figure 1C, left panel). The screen was
then repeated as an independent replicate and the correlation coefficient (R2) for the
two replicates was determined to be 0.68 (Figure 1C, middle panel). Data were
normalized to the median of each plate and used to calculate the Log2FC. The
distribution of the compounds based on the average of their Log2FC calculated within
the replicates is shown in Figure 1C (right panel). Z-scores were then calculated per
plate, based on the Log2FC values (Figure S1).
To elucidate targets, pathways, indications, and mechanisms of actions (MOA)
enriched among hits in the primary screen, compounds in the collection were classified
based on their reported target annotation. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was
used to assess the distribution of molecules with similar targets, functional categories or
MOA across the screen51,52. We next examined whether any target, pathway, indication,
or MOAs was enriched across the entire dataset. Compounds in the collection were
classified based on their reported annotations from three commercial vendors, and each
annotation group was tested for enrichment among hits using the GSEA software38,39.
Based on a nominal P-value cutoff of 0.05 and FDR q-value < 0.25, we found that

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.16.044016; this version posted April 17, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

15 target sets were enriched in our ranked hit list (Figure 2A and Figure S2). These
enriched targets and biological processes include allosteric modulators of the
benzodiazepine and retinoic receptors, cytosolic NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase
aldose reductase, potassium channels, cholesterol homeostasis, and serine proteases.
Antimalarials including chloroquine derivatives (i.e. Amopyroquine and AQ-13) were
also enriched, although the FDR q-value was below the established threshold (0.33)
(Figure 2A; Figure S2 and Table S2).
SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the epithelial cells in the respiratory tract53. To
elucidate the expression pattern of the genes that have been annotated to be targeted
by putative antiviral compounds, we compared the expression of drug target genes
enriched in the compound screen across cell types within the respiratory tract41.
Although both the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, and the priming protease
TMPRSS2, were found to be expressed within specific anatomical sampling locations in
the respiratory tract (Figure 2B, left heatmap), ACE2 expression was found to be
restricted to epithelial cell types including multiciliated, nasal, deuterosomal, secretory,
and basal cells (Figure 2B, right heatmap). Nonetheless, ACE2 expression has been
reported to be induced by type-I interferon90. Notably, a majority of the mapped targets
of active compounds also harbored expression in relevant respiratory epithelial cells,
suggesting these may be physiologically relevant drug targets (Figure 2B). Further
pathway analyses of these enriched MOAs and targets revealed enrichment in genes
involved in nuclear receptor pathways, GPCR ligand binding and signaling, and calcium
signaling (Figure S3), underscoring the potential critical role of these molecular circuits
in cellular control of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle40.
Orthogonal validation of selected anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds. To select
candidates for validation studies, compounds were ranked according to their Z-score in
the primary screen (Figure S1), and 100 compounds from replicate 1 were prioritized
based on this ranking, and an additional 75 molecules were selected that were only
found in replicate 2. 75 compounds were also selected according to their ranking

hits were chosen because they were classified within an enriched drug target and
pathway class (see above).
We initially assessed the activity of hits at half the original screening
concentration (2.5 µM) using an orthogonal assay readout. Specifically, Vero E6 cells
were pre-incubated with each compound dilution for 16 hours, followed by infection with
an independent SARS-CoV-2 isolate (SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020) (MOI = 0.75). 24
hours post-infection, cells were fixed and immunostained for the CoV nucleoprotein
(NP). Cellular nuclei were stained with DAPI, prior to automated imaging and analysis.
The percentage of infection for each well was calculated as the ratio of infected cells
stained with NP antibody, over the total number of cells. Each of these values was
normalized to the average of the DMSO control wells in each plate. Twenty-seven
percent of compounds (89 compounds) were found to reduce viral replication by at least
40 % at 2.5 µM (data not shown) when averaging data from at least two replicates.
These include compounds that were found to belong to enriched target classes (Figure
2A), including retinoic acid receptor agonists (LGD-1550, tretinoin, tamibarotene,
acitretin, tazarotene, RBAD), the aldose reductase inhibitor AL 3152, benzodiazepine
receptor agonists (ZK-93426, zaleplon GR, pagoclone) and antimalarial drugs (AQ-13
and hanfangchin A), as well as the FDA-approved anti-mycobacterial clofazimine.
Dose response analysis.
Although specific for each compound, therapeutic dose ranges are typically
expected to track to cellular EC50s well below 1 µM concentrations. Therefore, we
conducted a dose response analysis to determine the relationship between compound
concentration and antiviral activity. Compound concentrations tested ranged from
1.1 nM to 2.5 µM in the immunofluorescence assay described previously. Total cell
counts were used to assess compound cytotoxicity (Figure S4). In addition to
remdesivir, treatment with 17 compounds resulted in discernable dose-dependent
antiviral activities, most of which could be segregated based on broad functional,
structural, or target-based classes (Figure 3A). 10 of these known drugs have
EC50s > 750 nM or values that could not be exactly extrapolated (Figures 3A and
Figure S5), while 7 compounds harbored EC50s < 500 nM (6 of which reached > 80%

inhibiton of the infection at the highest concentration (Figure 3B-C)), suggesting that
effective antiviral potency could likely be achieved during therapeutic dosing of a
COVID-19 patient. Data are also available at reframedb.org.
To enable prioritization of known drugs for preclinical and clinical evaluation for
the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, a summary of the publicly disclosed and relevant
preclinical and clinical properties of the most advanced among these molecules are
annotated in Table 1 (information retrieved from CortellisTM (Clarivate Analytics) and

Discussion
Since the beginning of January 2020, an extraordinary number of investigational
programs and clinical trials has been initiated in a concerted effort to identify
therapeutics against the rapidly growing COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical trials using
repurposed clinical-stage or approved drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir,
lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine and others have been under investigation for
treating COVID-19 patients15,16,20,54-59. Some other therapies, such as treatment with
antibodies from seroconverted idividuals, are also being investigated. However, most of
the reported studies have been conducted in small cohorts and thus should be
considered preliminary, with larger case-control clinical evaluations still pending15-16,19-22
The elucidation of additional candidate therapies would greatly enhance the
probability of rapidly identifying safe and efficacious treatment options, and would also
enable the development of combinatorial regimens (“cocktails”), which reflects the
current treatment strategies for HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV)60-62.
Large-scale surveys of existing drugs that may harbor antiviral activities can
significantly facilitate such repositioning efforts. A recently reported SARS-CoV-2human protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis identified 332 viral-host interactions, 66
of which are potential druggable human host factors targeted by 69 known drugs that
have FDA approval, however activities on SARS-CoV-2 replication have not yet been
reported63. An additional study that tested a focused panel of 48 FDA-approved drugs,
previously shown to have antiviral activity against both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV,

also demonstrated that several known drugs harbor potent antiviral activities against
SARS-CoV-264.
Here, we report the high-throughput analysis of approximately 12,000 known
drugs evaluated for activity against SARS-CoV-2 replication. The assay, conducted in
Vero E6 cells was designed to capture multicycle replication, based upon low viral input
(MOI = 0.01) and an extended endpoint measurement (72 hours post-infection).
Although cell-based assays can be biased towards capturing inhibitors of viral entry, the
assay was constructed to interrogate each step of the viral life cycle. Of note, one
potential limitation of Vero cells is that, due to species differences, pro-drugs that
require the human host cell machinery for processing into their active form, such as
some nucleoside inhibitors, may not harbor the same potency as in human cells.
Consistently, we found that remdesivir inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication ~60-fold more
potently in human cells in comparison to Vero E6 cells (Figure 3A and Figure S5; data
not shown).
The dynamic range of the viral-induced CPE in the assay was small (~2-2.5 fold),
but robust and reproducible (Figure 1B). Both the optimization using the LOPAC®
1280library and the first ReFRAME collection screen displayed acceptable Zʹ factors
(0.4 and 0.51, respectively). The duplicate ReFRAME screen, had a reduced dynamic
range (1.5-fold) and corresponding Zʹ factor (0.19). Although the correlation between
the two ReFRAME replications was high (R2=0.68), there were compounds that were
found active in replicate 1, but not replicate 2 (Figure 1C, bottom right of middle
panel). While we leveraged all datasets to select molecules for further validation,
compound selection was weighted for replicate 1. Specifically, in addition to
28 molecules from the LOPAC®1280 library, 250 drugs were selected based on their
activity. 48 additional ones, belonging to enriched target/MOA sets based on GSEA
analysis, were also included.
These selected compounds were tested in an orthogonal assay that directly
measures viral replication, in contrast to the indirect measurement of replication
assessed by CPE. Here, we took advantage of a high-throughput immunofluorescence
assay that monitors infection levels as reflected by SARS-CoV-2 N protein expression
at a single cell resolution. Importantly, this validation step enables the separation of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.16.044016; this version posted April 17, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

molecules that function to block CPE (i.e. cell death), instead of direct effects on
replication. This assay was found to be most robust at a 24-hour timepoint using an MOI
of 0.75, thus, the antiviral activities of compounds were not interrogated under the
original MOI or 72-hour timepoint conditions. Both the earlier timepoint and higher MOI
likely biased the validation screen towards the confirmation of early stage inhibitors.
Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that several molecules with potent EC50s were
only able to inhibit replication to approximately 50-60 % at multiple high concentrations,
including MLN-3897, YH-1238 and SL-11128 (Figure 3A and Figure S5). While this
may represent the maximal ability of these molecules to suppress viral replication,
alternatively, analysis of these molecules utilizing lower MOIs at later timepoint may
reveal greater inhibition of infection. In addition, validation assays were conducted
employing drug concentrations that were half of what was utilized in the screen (2.5 µM
versus 5 µM) and using a second isolate of SARS-CoV-2. The introduction of these
stringencies during the validation step, as well as false positive activities from the HTS
assay, likely account for ~30 % confirmation rate observed at this step of the analysis.
Tretinoin, clofazimine, acitretin were amongst the notable validated compounds,
since they have been approved by the FDA. Clofazimine is a lipophilic riminophenazine
antibiotic, with described antimycobacterial and anti-inflammatory activity65 used for the
treatment of leprosy. Main adverse effects include changes in skin pigmentation,
nausea and vomiting. The antibacterial activity of clofazimine is described to be related
to its ability to bind to the bacterial DNA. Interestingly, this compound was also identified
as a potent antiparasitic drug active against Cryptosporidium, during a repurposing
screen of the ReFRAME library30. Further studies are required to understand the
mechanism by which this molecule blocks the replication of this positive-strand RNA
virus, and determination of the dose-response relationship for clofazimine will enable
assessment of whether antiviral efficacy can be achieved at therapeutic doses. Acitretin
is an approved orally bioavailable retinoid used for the treatment of psoriasis66.
Tretinoin, together with tamibarotene, which is registered in Japan, as well as LGD155, tamibarotene, tazarotene and RBAD, were all validated compounds belonging to
the enriched GSEA class of class of retinoic acid agonists highly enriched in the GSEA
analysis (Figure 2A). It is currently unclear how the activation of the transcriptional

program governed by retinoic acid receptors may impinge upon SARS-CoV-2
replication.
Six additional compounds which confirmed in our validation studies also
modulate targets that were enriched in the high-throughput screen. Those include
aldose reductase inhibitor AL 3151, the benzodiazepine receptor agonists ZK-93426,
zaleplon GR and pagoclone, and the two antimalarial drugs AQ-13 and hanfangchin A.
Antimalarial drugs have been reported to effectively block several viral infections67,
including SARS-CoV-226. However, the activities of many of these, in particular
chloroquine derivatives, have not been recapitulated in clinical trials17,18. Drugs
belonging to this class are generally reported to be less effective in blocking viral
infections compared to their anti-malarial activity, with EC50 generally in a µM range67.
The concentration required for their antiviral activity could thus likely be difficult to reach
in humans, without causing adverse effects. Taken together, confirmation of compounds
with membership in enriched target classes underscore the importance of these
molecular circuits in the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 replication and support the
evaluation of additional preclinical and clinical stage molecules that target overrepresented mechanisms.
Among the 17 compounds validated to show a dose-response relationship in our
orthogonal assay, 10 compounds harbored EC50 antiviral activities >750 nM, suggesting
that additional preclinical studies will likely be required to determine whether
administration of these compounds can achieve sufficient systemic exposure to enable
antiviral activity (Figure S5). Seven molecules were found to inhibit viral replication at
EC50 concentration <500 nM. These include Z LVG CHN2, a preclinical tripeptide
derivative that displays a broad-spectrum bactericidal activity. Specifically, this molecule
has been previously shown to suppress herpes simplex virus (HSV) replication by
inhibiting the enzymatic activity of HSV-encoded cysteine protease68, which may
indicate that the antiviral function of Z LVG CHN2 occurs through inhibition of SARSCOV-2 3CLpro protease. Another preclinical molecule that exhibits strong antiviral
activity, MDL 28170, is a potent cell permeable calpain I and II inhibitor. Interestingly,
MDL 28170 was previously found to impair infection by SARS-COV-1 and Ebola virus
(EBOV)50,69. Additionally, astemizole a registered anti-histamine H1 receptor antagonist

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.16.044016; this version posted April 17, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

that also reported to have anti-malarial properties70, inhibited replication at an EC50
concentration of ~1.1 µM. Due to fatal arrhythmias when given in high doses or in
combination with certain other common drugs, astemizole has been withdrawn in many
countries71. Therefore, thorough safety studies are required to determine if there exists
a sufficient therapeutic index for the acute treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
MLN-3897 (AVE-9897) is an orally active chemokine CCR1 antagonist and was
evaluated in phase II clinical studies for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and
multiple sclerosis (MS)72, showing a dose of 10 mg once daily was well tolerated73. It
was determined to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication at an estimated EC50 concentration of
140 nM (Figure 2), and the Cmax of the compound has been reported at 9.0 nM (10 mg
QD). Therefore, additional in vivo studies will be required to determine if sufficient
systemic concentrations can be reached to promote antiviral activities. The mechanism

pathway74.

Interestingly,

Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathways are employed by SARS-CoV-1 to support its
replication via multiple well-documented mechanisms75,76, and thus this signaling axis
may also represent a critical therapeutic target for host-directed SARS-CoV-2 antivirals.
Human cysteinyl cathepsins, including cathepsin B, cathepsin L, and cathepsin
K, are required for the proteolytic processing of virally encoded proteins during
infection77-79. Cathepsin activity seems to be required for proper processing of the
SARS-CoV-1 S protein within the endosome in order to activate its fusogenic acitivity78.
Inhibition of cathepsin L activity has been previously shown to efficiently suppress
SARS-CoV-1 infection78. We found ONO 5334 (a cathepsin K inhibitor) and VBY-825 (a
reversible cathepsin protease inhibitor) to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dosedependent manner, however additional studies will be required to determine if their
antiviral activities are due to inhibiting proteolysis of viral or host cellular proteins. ONO
5334 harbored an antiviral EC50 of ~500 nM, which is in range of a previously reported
85 % activity observed at 100 nM in an osteoclast-mediated bone resorption assay80.
Importantly, the Cmax of this compound is 1.6 µM (300 mg QD), and treatment with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.16.044016; this version posted April 17, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

ONO-5334 was well tolerated up to daily doses of 300 mg and for up to 12 months
without any clinically relevant safety concerns. ONO5334 reached phase II clinical trials
for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, but development was
discontinued due to an unfavorable competitive landscape81,82. VBY-825, which is in
preclinical development, is another cathepsin inhibitor harboring potential antiviral
activities against SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 of ~300 nM, and it shows high potency
against cathepsins B, L, S and V in vitro83. Overall, the identification of VBY-825 and
ONO 5334 as effective antiviral molecules against SAR-COV-2 supports the
repositioning of these, and potentially additional protease inhibitors, for the treatment of
COVID-19 disease.
Finally, apilimod, a specific PIKfyve kinase inhibitor, was found to inhibit SARSCoV-2 replication at an EC50 concentration of 23 nM (Figure 3). Importantly, apilimod is
found to be well tolerated in humans showing a desirable safety profile at doses of
≤ 125 mg BID, and the Cmax of this compound is 0.265 +/- 0.183 µM (70 mg QD)84,85.
These data indicate that therapeutic dosing of apilimod in patients can achieve
concentrations that are likely to promote antiviral activity. Apilimod has been evaluated
in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of active Crohn's disease and rheumatoid
arthritis (RA)86, and in additional phase II trials for the oral treatment of common variable
immunodeficiency (CVID), but did not show efficacy for these indications85,87. In 2019,
orphan drug designation was granted to apilimod in the U.S. for the treatment of
follicular lymphoma88, with phase I clinical trials ongoing. Notably, it has been reported
that apilimod efficiently inhibits EBOV, Lassa virus (LASV), and Marburg virus (MARV)
in human cell lines, underscoring its potential broad-spectrum antiviral activity44,89. The
underlying mechanism for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection by apilimod is
currently not known. However, since PIKfyve predominately resides in early endosomes
and plays an essential role in maintenance of endomembrane homeostasis, apilimod
likely blocks viral low pH-dependent entry through inhibition of the lipid kinase activity of
PIKfyve.
Taken together, this study has illuminated a compendium of druggable targets,
pathways, biological processes and small molecules that modulate the SARS-CoV-2
replication cycle. These data can be leveraged to focus studies aimed at deciphering

the biology of this coronavirus, and to guide additional directed repurposing studies,
particularly of existing late-stage preclinical assets. Critically, this campaign led to the
identification and validation of 30 molecules with antiviral activities against SARS-CoV2, including four FDA-approved compounds, one drug registered in Japan, and
11 molecules that have entered clinical trials. The availability of human safety and
pharmacological data of these molecules is expected to enable rapid preclinical and
clinical assessment of these compounds. However, expedited regulatory review under
EUA guidelines also provides a rationale for the development of earlier stage candidate
molecules that can be deployed for use during this current pandemic outbreak. It is
critical that multiple therapeutic options that demonstrate efficacy against SARS-CoV-2
are available to mitigate potential emergence of drug resistance, as well as enable the
evaluation of optimal therapeutic cocktails that are broadly curative for COVID-19
disease.

A) Screen schematic. Distribution of the approximately 12,000 compounds in the
ReFRAME collection across different stages of clinical development. Compounds were
pre-spotted in 384-well plates at a final concentration of 5 µM. 3,000 Vero E6 cells were
added to each well and pre-incubated with each compound for 16 h, followed by
infection with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (HKU-001a) at an MOI of 0.01. ATP
levels in each well were measured 72 h post-infection by the Cell Titer Glo viability
assay, as a readout of the cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by the virus. B)
