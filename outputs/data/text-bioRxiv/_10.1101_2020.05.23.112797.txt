Abstract
Influenza and other respiratory viruses represent a significant threat to public health, national security,
and the world economy, and can lead to the emergence of global pandemics such as the current COVID19 crisis. One of the greatest barriers to the development of effective therapeutic agents to treat
influenza, coronaviruses, and many other infections of the respiratory tract is the absence of a robust
preclinical model. Preclinical studies currently rely on high-throughput, low-fidelity in vitro screening with
cell lines and/or low-throughput animal models that often provide a poor correlation to human clinical
responses. Here, we introduce a human primary airway epithelial cell-based model integrated into a highthroughput platform where tissues are cultured at an air-liquid interface (PREDICT96-ALI). We present
results on the application of this platform to influenza and coronavirus infections, providing multiple
readouts capable of evaluating viral infection kinetics and potentially the efficacy of therapeutic agents in
an in vitro system. Several strains of influenza A virus are shown to successfully infect the human primary
cell-based airway tissue cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI), and as a proof-of-concept, the effect of
the antiviral oseltamivir on one strain of Influenza A is evaluated. Human coronaviruses NL63 (HCoV-NL63)
and SARS-CoV-2 enter host cells via ACE2 and utilize the protease TMPRSS2 for protein priming, and we
confirm expression of both in our ALI model. We also demonstrate coronavirus infection in this system
with HCoV-NL63, observing sufficient viral propagation over 96 hours post-infection to indicate successful

infection of the primary cell-based model. This new capability has the potential to address a gap in the
rapid assessment of therapeutic efficacy of various small molecules and antiviral agents against influenza
and other respiratory viruses including coronaviruses.

Introduction
The specter of a pandemic respiratory virus such as influenza or the current outbreak of coronavirus
represents one of the greatest threats to human health [1,2]. For influenza, the development of
efficacious, long-lasting, and seasonally-consistent vaccinations has been challenged by the occurrence of
both antigenic drift and shift [3]. Currently, four antivirals are in wide use for treatment of influenza, three
neuraminidase inhibitors and more recently, a cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor, baloxivir marboxil
[4]. These treatments are generally effective, but genetic changes to endemic viruses present challenges
similar to those encountered during the development of vaccines [5]. These challenges are exacerbated
by the long developmental timelines typically associated with manufacturing, scale up, and regulatory
approval for novel antivirals or vaccinations. The current COVID-19 pandemic of the novel coronavirus has
spurred aggressive vaccine development efforts, but even with this accelerated timeline, the current wave
of infection is projected to yield significant morbidity and mortality [6]. Therefore, a critical element of
medical treatment strategy is the application of repurposed FDA-approved antiviral medications originally
developed for other diseases [7].

Several preclinical research tools are available to model respiratory viruses, but due to the complexity of
the human lung and requirements to accurately model species-specific viral infections, these models
provide a poor correlation as a basis for guiding clinical strategy [8]. For example, a standard approach to
investigate influenza A viruses (IAV) typically begins with the inoculation of cell lines in conventional
culture well plates, such as Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) or Calu-3 cells [9,10]. While these cells
infect easily and provide a rapid early assessment of the potential efficacy of a therapeutic for IAV, they
lack the critical mechanisms and signaling pathways that healthy human airway tissues provide in
response to viral infection. Therefore, although these systems are easy to use, they are not often accurate
predictors of human clinical efficacy [11]. For coronaviruses, Calu-3 or Vero E6 cells are often used for
similar reasons, but again differ by species, cell source, disease state, and innate antiviral signaling
pathways [12,13] compared to normal, healthy human conducting airway and alveolar epithelium [14],

thus providing an insufficient model. Unfortunately, complications also exist within animal models of IAV,
not only in mice, rats, and guinea pigs, but even in more human-relevant options for evaluation such as
ferrets and macaques [15,16]. These models often require species-adapted viral strains, and fail to
recapitulate features of human innate antiviral responses and clinical symptoms of infection [17,18].
Similar challenges are faced for coronavirus infection studies, where the low-throughput and limited
availability of appropriate animal models, combined with concerns about their predictive power, are
forcing early and often high-risk testing in humans. While many experimental studies are underway to
identify drugs with antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 [19], the discovery pipeline would benefit
significantly from rapid and accurate preclinical models based on human cell culture.

The challenges with preclinical models and tools have spurred the development of cell culture platforms
comprising human primary cells in a microfluidic environment, commonly known as microphysiological
systems (MPS) or organs-on-chips [20]. Over the past two decades, these devices have evolved from early
toxicology platforms to today’s wide range of technologies including multi-organ systems [21,22] and a
variety of organ-specific models including airway or alveolar tissue systems [23,24]. While the integration
of human primary cells or stem cell-derived populations in a physiologically-relevant microenvironment
represents a tremendous advance over the use of cell lines in principle, in practice the application of these
systems in pharmacological research and development has been severely gated by several factors. These
limitations include low-throughput and complex operation, a lack of relevant metrics for system
assessment, the use of research-grade materials and components, the lack of critical components of tissue
or organ structure required to replicate infection, and most critically, an absence of confidence in the in
vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) for these technologies. Our group has developed systems that offer higher
throughput, compatibility with existing pharmaceutical laboratory infrastructure, convenient readouts for
quality control and physiological monitoring, and that are demonstrating the potential as platforms for
preclinical studies across many disease areas and application domains [25,26].

In this manuscript, we build on our previous work and the work of others to develop an in vitro model
with an ALI capability sufficient to support physiologically relevant epithelial differentiation such as that
in gut or kidney models [25,26]. For functional proximal airway or alveolar models, human primary cells
should be cultured at an ALI representing a suitable analogue for the respiratory barrier tissues that

mimics mucus formation, mucociliary flow, and a range of physiologically relevant responses [23,24]. Our
airway model, established in the PREDICT96-ALI platform, provides this ALI and supports IAV and
coronavirus infection, while enabling high-throughput, real-time evaluation of experiments across various
viral strains, multiplicities of infection (MOIs), human donors, time points, and statistically significant
numbers of replicates on a single 96-device engineered platform. Three strains of IAV, A/WSN/33 H1N1,
A/California/04/09 H1N1, and A/Hong Kong/8/68 H3N2 are used to inoculate human primary airway
tissues cultured at an ALI, and viral infection kinetics are monitored through a combination of readouts
including quantitation of viral load. As a proof-of-concept, viral infection kinetics are investigated for the
A/WSN/33 H1N1 strain of IAV in response to dosing with oseltamivir, demonstrating how this system
might be applied to evaluate the efficacy of antiviral therapeutic compounds. We also confirm expression
of the receptor ACE2 and the serine protease TMPRSS2 in these tissues, and we demonstrate viral
propagation and infection kinetics of HCoV-NL63, which, like SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, utilizes ACE2 as
its target receptor. These results demonstrate that the PREDICT96-ALI platform can be used to model IAV
and coronavirus infections and could potentially be used to screen the efficacy of candidate therapeutics
in a clinically relevant manner.

Methods
Microfluidic Platform
The PREDICT96 organ-on-chip platform consists of a microfluidic culture plate with 96 individual devices
and a perfusion system driven by 192 microfluidic pumps integrated into the plate lid [25,26]. Here the
platform is adapted to support culture of barrier tissues, such as airway tissues, by establishment and
maintenance of an ALI.

Each device in the PREDICT96-ALI culture plate was formed from a 2x2 array within a standard 384-well
plate, with the wall between the top two wells removed to create a 3-well cluster. This configuration is
shown in Figure 1a. A slotted hard plastic microwell (0.864 mm height, 1 mm width, 2.5 mm length) was
positioned in the center of the large well, with a microfluidic channel (0.25 mm height, 1 mm width)
aligned underneath that was linked to the two remaining wells in each device. The channel was capped
from below with a thin optically clear layer. A microporous membrane was used to separate the top
microwell from the bottom microchannel to permit the establishment of an ALI.

To fabricate the PREDICT96-ALI culture plate, a UV laser system (Protolaser U4: LPKF Laser and Electronics,
Garbsen, Germany) was used to laser-cut thin films of cyclic olefin polymer (COP) (ZF14-188: Zeon Corp.,
Tokyo, Japan) and cyclic olefin copolymer (8007 COC: Tekni-plex, Wayne, PA, USA). The COP layers were
adhered together using low-glass transition temperature COC in a heated hydraulic press (Carver Inc.,
Wabash, IN, USA), and were separated with a 24 µm-thick track-etched polycarbonate membrane with
pore diameter of 0.4 or 1 µm (it4ip S.A., Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium) patterned with an array of holes to
provide fluidic access ports to the bottom channel. The microfluidic stack is attached to a modified 384well COP plate (Aurora Microplates, Whitefish, MT, USA) using a 0.135 mm thick pressure sensitive
adhesive consisting of a 25.4 µm polyester carrier film with MA-69 acrylic medical grade adhesive ARcare®
90106 (Adhesives Research, Inc., Glen Rock, PA, USA), which had been previously laser-cut in the pattern
of the well plate grid and laminated with a hydraulic press at 1.0 MPa for 2 min. Further details on the
fabrication process are found elsewhere [25,26].

Integrated Micropumps
As described in our previous work [25], in order to establish recirculating flow in the microchannels, we
incorporate a self-priming micropump array into the lid that serves as the fluidic interface with the culture
plate via stainless steel tubes. The PREDICT96 pumping system has 192 individual pneumatically-actuated
micropumps embedded in the plate lid: two per culture device, one for the chamber above the membrane
and one for below. However, since the upper chamber is at ALI, only the 96 pumps serving the
microchannel are in use during experiments. Actuation of the pumps transfers media between the wells
linked by the bottom channel and establishes a hydrostatic pressure differential, inducing flow through
each microchannel.

The pneumatic and fluidic manifolds of the micropump array were constructed with laser-micromachined
Ultem polyetherimide and Kapton polyimide films (McMaster-Carr, Elmhurst, Illinois USA) laminated in a
heated hydraulic press with phenolic butyral thermosetting adhesive film (R/flex 1000, Rogers Corp.,
Chandler, Arizona, USA). Fluidic tubing (21G 316L stainless steel hypodermic tubes: New England Small
Tube Corp., Litchfield, NH, USA) were glued into the assembly using 353NDPK Hi-Temp Epoxy (Thorlabs,
Newton, NJ, USA).

Culture, Cryopreservation, and PREDICT96-ALI Seeding and Differentiation of NHBEs
Normal Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells (NHBEs) were purchased from Lifeline Cell Technology and Lonza
(Table 1). To maintain stocks of each NHBE donor, cells were thawed and plated at 2500 cells/cm 2 on
804G media-coated tissue culture flasks (804G media made as described elsewhere [27]), cultured in
Bronchialife (Lifeline Cell Technology), and passaged using Accutase (Sigma). After two passages, NHBEs
were cryopreserved using 65% FBS (Thermo Fisher), 25% Bronchialife (Lifeline Cell Technology), and 10%
DMSO (Sigma). Prior to seeding, PREDICT96-ALI plates were sterilized overnight with ethylene oxide gas
followed by one week of outgassing in a vacuum chamber. PREDICT96-ALI plates were subsequently
treated with plasma for 120 seconds and washed briefly with 70% ethanol, rinsed three times in distilled
water, and coated overnight in 804G media. To seed PREDICT96-ALI plates, NHBEs were thawed, counted,
re-suspended in complete small airway epithelial cell growth media (SAGM; Lonza), 100 U/mL penicillinstreptomycin (Thermo Fisher), 5 M ROCKi (Tocris), 1 M A-83-01 (Tocris), 0.2 M DMH-1 (Tocris), 0.5
M CHIR99021 (Tocris) as described elsewhere [28] (hereafter referred to as SAGM + 4i), and plated at
10,000 cells per device in a 3 L volume directly onto the membrane. After 48 hours (h) of growth in SAGM
+ 4i media, differentiation was initiated using fresh HBTEC-ALI media (Lifeline Cell Technology) plus 100
U/mL penicillin/streptomycin. After 48 h of submerged differentiation, the ALI was initiated by aspirating
media from the apical surface of the tissue in the top chamber, while 60 L of fresh HBTEC-ALI or customALI media was added to the bottom chamber. Pumping was initiated at 1 L /min in the bottom channel,
and the media in the bottom channel was changed daily thereafter. Tissues were matured over the course
of 3-5 weeks in ALI culture prior to viral infection experiments. To remove accumulated mucus from the
apical surface of the maturing tissue, 100 µL of 1x Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) was added to the
apical surface of each tissue and incubated on the tissues for 1 h at 37 ⁰C with rocking, subsequently
followed by an additional 5 min wash with 100 µL of 1x HBSS at room temperature every 7 days (d). Mucus
washings were pooled, collected and stored at -80⁰C until processed. Tissue maturity and quality control
was scored by a combination of metrics including barrier function, percent ciliated cells, ciliary beat,
mucus secretion, and global tissue morphology, and this score was used to determine if individual devices
of PREDICT96-ALI airway tissue were suitable for downstream experimentation and viral infection.
Downstream processing of tissues following viral inoculation was generally conducted at 4-6 weeks of ALI
and included tissue apical washes, basal media collection, measurement of barrier function, harvest of
tissue for RNA extraction, and fixation for immunofluorescence imaging.

Immunofluorescence and confocal imaging
To prepare PREDICT96-ALI airway tissues for immunofluorescence staining, tissues were fixed in situ using
4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 15 min at room temperature rocking and washed three times with 1x
phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Tissues were subsequently permeabilized with 0.3% Triton-100 (Sigma)
for 30 min and blocked with 3% normal goat serum (NGS, Thermo Fisher) containing 0.1% Tween-20
(Sigma) for 60 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies for basal cells (CK5, Thermo Fisher), goblet
cells (Muc5AC, Thermo), ciliated cells (acetylated-tubulin, Abcam and beta-tubulin, Sigma), cellular
proliferation (Ki67, Abcam), and influenza A nucleoprotein (IAV-NP, Abcam) were diluted 1:100 in 3% NGS
including 0.1% Tween-20 and incubated overnight at 4°C rocking. Devices were washed twice with PBS
followed by one rinse with 3% NGS plus 0.1% Tween-20 for 5 min each with rocking and secondary
antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Thermo Fisher) and Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG
(Thermo Fisher) were diluted 1:300 and incubated for 18 h at 4 ⁰C with rocking. Secondary antibodies
were removed by washing three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20, and tissues were incubated
with rocking at room temperature for 30 min with Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain (Thermo Fisher, 10 mg/mL
stock) at a 1:800 dilution and Phalloidin-iFluor 647 Reagent (Abcam) at 1:1000. After 30 min, the
PREDICT96-ALI tissues were washed at least three times for 5 min with PBS prior to imaging. Stained
PREDICT96-ALI devices were imaged using a Zeiss LSM700 laser scanning confocal microscope and Zen
Black software. Tile scans and z-stacks of the tissue at 20x and 40x magnification were acquired.

Viral Stocks, Propagation, Titer and Anti-Viral Compound
Influenza A viral strains A/WSN/33 H1N1 (influenza A/WSN/33, WSN/33, gift of Dr. Peter Palese),
A/California/04/09 H1N1 (ATCC), and A/Hong Kong/8/68 H3N2 (Charles River). IAV strains were
propagated in MDCK cells (ATCC), harvested in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Thermo
Fisher) containing 7.5% bovine serum album (BSA, Invitrogen), 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin
(Invitrogen), and 0.1 µg/mL N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-trypsin (TPCK-trypsin, Sigma)
and titered by viral plaque assay using MDCK cells as previously reported [29]. Viral infection experiments
using PREDICT96-ALI tissue used A/WSN/33 H1N1 at passage 1, A/California/04/09 H1N1 at passage 3,
and A/Hong Kong/8/68 H3N2 at passage 2.

Human coronavirus strain (HCoV) NL63 was purchased from ATCC and propagated two times in Lilly
Laboratories Cell-Monkey Kidney 2 (LLC-MK2) using a method adapted from Herzog [30]. In brief, HCoVNL63 was grown using LLC-MK2 cells in a limiting dilution series. Recovered virus was harvested from the
last well of the dilution series showing diffuse cytopathic effect (CPE) at 4-5 d post-infection (p.i.).
Subsequently, confluent LLC-MK2 monolayers were inoculated in 25 cm2 flasks with a 1:10 dilution of viral
supernatant from the prior viral passage. The flasks were incubated at 34°C, 5% CO2, and harvested on
day 4 when diffuse CPE was observed. To harvest the virus, flasks were frozen at -80 °C and thawed at 37
°C twice, and cells and supernatant were pooled and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 3000 rpm. Cleared
supernatant was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C, and is referred to henceforth as passage 2 virus. HCoVNL63 was harvested in EMEM (ATCC) containing 0.1% BSA (Sigma) and 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin
(Thermo Fisher). Viral infection experiments with PREDICT96-ALI tissue used HCoV-NL63 at passage 2.

Viral plaque assay using LLC-MK2 cells were used to titer propagated HCoV-NL63. A 10-fold serial dilution
was performed using the propagated virus, followed by 1 h of viral binding (100 µL of appropriate viral
dilution per well) with rocking at 34 °C on confluent LLC-MK2 cells. After unbound virus was removed with
one wash of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the cells were overlaid with agar (0.3%) in EMEM
supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin. After the agar solidified at room
temperature, the plates were incubated for 6 d at 34 °C until diffuse CPE was observed. The gel overlay
was removed and the wells washed once with PBS. Cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma)
over night at 4°C and stained with 0.1% crystal violet (Sigma) in 4% ethanol (Sigma) for 30 min at room
temperature. Stained cells were washed in PBS and imaged, and plaque counts were determined using
images analyzed using a customized MATLAB script to determine the plaque forming units (PFU) per mL.

Oseltamivir carboxylate (F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) was used in anti-viral screens
performed on PREDICT96-ALI tissue. Oseltamivir was diluted to 1 µM in complete HBTEC-ALI or customALI media and applied to the bottom channel of PREDICT-ALI airway tissues subject to anti-viral evaluation
following the standard apical wash of the tissue and 2 h prior to IAV-inoculation. Upon and after IAVinoculation of the apical side of the PREDICT96-ALI tissue, 1 µM oseltamivir was maintained in the basal
media for the duration of the study. Basal media changes including oseltamivir occurred every 24 h.

Infection of PREDICT96-ALI Tissues with Viral Strains
To prepare PREDICT96-ALI tissues for influenza and coronavirus infection, a mucus wash using 1x HBSS as
described above was performed. Viral strains were thawed on ice and individually diluted in viral infection
media to reach the relevant MOI. Influenza virus infection media was composed of a single IAV strain
diluted to the appropriate MOI in HBSS for A/WSN/33 and in HBSS including 1 µg/mL TPCK-trypsin (Sigma)
for A/California/04/09 and A/Hong Kong/8/68. Coronavirus infection media was composed HCoV-NL63
diluted to the appropriate MOI in HBSS. When the mucus wash was completed, viral inoculum was added
to the apical side of the tissues. Each experiment included both an untreated control in which ALI was
maintained and an untreated control that was submerged in HBTEC-ALI or custom-ALI media for
comparison to the viral inoculum-treated groups. The time of incubation varied by viral strain, with
A/WSN/33 and HCoV-NL63 each individually incubated on the PREDICT96-ALI tissues for 6 h with rocking
and A/California/04/09 and A/Hong Kong/8/68 each individually incubated for 1 h with rocking. Following
incubation, both the top chamber and the bottom channel were aspirated, the apical surface of the tissue
washed three times with 1x HBSS with the final wash collected for reference, and this was followed by
complete aspiration of the top chamber to resume ALI culture. A volume of 60 L of HBTEC-ALI or customALI media was added to the bottom channel to resume normal culture conditions, with 1 µg/mL TPCKtrypsin maintained in the media of devices that had been inoculated with A/California/04/09 and A/Hong
Kong/8/68. At 24 or 48 h intervals p.i., an apical wash using 1x HBSS was performed at 34-37 ⁰C for 1.5 h
with rocking to collect both mucus and virus. Specifically, 100 µL of 1x HBSS was added to the apical
surface of each tissue and incubated on the tissues for 45 min at 34-37 ⁰C with rocking, subsequently
followed by an additional 50 µL wash with 1x HBSS for 45 min at 34-37 ⁰C with rocking and a final 50 µL
wash with 1x HBSS for 5 min at room temperature. Apical washings were pooled, collected and stored at
-80 ⁰C until processed. Basal media was collected at time points p.i. that correspond to mucus and virus
wash collections and stored at -80 ⁰C. Following apical wash and basal media collections, 60 L of HBTECALI or custom-ALI media (including 1 µg/mL TPCK-trypsin for devices that had been inoculated with
A/California/04/09 and A/Hong Kong/8/68) was added to the bottom channel and complete aspiration of
the top chamber to resume ALI culture was performed to resume normal culture conditions.

RNA extraction and qRT-PCR
Supernatant viral RNA was collected from the apical side of PREDICT96-ALI tissues and isolated using a
QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s specifications. Supernatant volumes of

100 μL were brought to 140 μL using HBSS. In order to collect bulk tissue RNA from devices, RLT buffer
(Qiagen) with 0.01% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) was added to both the top chamber and bottom
channel to disrupt the differentiated tissue. Tissue RNA was extracted from PREDICT96-ALI devices using
an RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) per the manufacturer’s instructions. One-step quantitative reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was then performed on extracted RNA samples using
a QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) following the standard protocol for a QuantStudio 7 Flex RT-PCR
system. Briefly, 7.8 μL of the extracted supernatant viral RNA was used in a 20 μL reaction volume and 3.8
μL tissue RNA was used in a 20 μL reaction volume, and samples were run in duplicate. The reaction was
run in an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 7 Flex System (Thermo Scientific) using the following condition:
50 °C for 20 min, 95 °C for 5 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 sec and 60 °C for 45 sec. Taqman primers and
probe targeting IAV-M were ordered from Thermo Scientific with the following sequences: FLUAM-7-F:

FLUAM-161-R:

GGTGACAGGATTGGTCTTGTCTTTA,

FLUAM-49-P6:

TCAGGCCCCCTCAAAGCCGAG, and Taqman primers and probe targeting HCoV-NL63 (Assay ID:
Vi06439673_s1) were ordered from Thermo Scientific. Taqman Gene Expression Assays (Thermo
Scientific) were used to target the following proteins in lung tissue: ACE2 (Hs01085333_m1), TMPRSS2
(Hs01122322_m1), TUBB6 (Hs00603164_m1), and Muc5AC (Hs01365616_m1). Absolute quantification
(copies/mL) of supernatant viral RNA was calculated using a standard curve generated from serial dilutions
of A/PR/8/34 viral RNA (Charles River Laboratories) or linearized HCoV-NL63 viral RNA (ATCC).
Comparative cycle threshold (Ct) values were determined using the method described by Schmittgen and
Livak [31] using normalization to the housekeeping gene GAPDH.

Results
Creation of a high-throughput ALI platform for dynamic culture of human airway tissue: PREDICT96-ALI
The adaptation of the PREDICT96 platform [26] for the ALI model allows for the ability to inoculate
cultured tissues in each channel apically or basally, to sample the basal media at regular intervals, and to
examine the tissues at the completion of each study, as shown in Figure 1a. The schematic (left) shows
the individual device configuration within the 96-device platform, where a 2x2 array from the 384 well
standard structure is used to access the top chamber (top two wells of the 2x2 array) and the bottom
channel is accessed by an inlet and outlet from the bottom two elements of the 2x2 array, respectively.
An exploded-view schematic (right) of a single device configuration depicts the assembly of the material
layers required to establish the microfluidic structure of the PREDICT96-ALI platform. Photographs in
Figure 1b depict the PREDICT96-ALI platform from an upright view (top left), inverted view (top right), and
overhead view (bottom), with 8 rows and 12 columns of the configuration shown in Figure 1a. Figure 1c
presents a typical plate layout, highlighting the capacity of the 96-device plate to house replicates (four
per condition) for each of three therapeutics, across two donor NHBE cell populations at three MOIs. The
PREDICT96-ALI layouts can easily accommodate different experimental designs, for example replacing
three therapeutic candidates with a test of three different human cell donors on the plate for a single
therapeutic under evaluation.

PREDICT96-ALI recapitulates healthy human airway structure and composition
First, the PREDICT96-ALI system was used to establish the healthy baseline airway model, prepared as
described in the Methods section, and morphology and cell populations were evaluated using high
resolution confocal microscopy and immunohistochemistry. An illustration depicts the development of a
healthy airway model within PREDICT96-ALI (Figure 2a). The experimental timeline and setup for the
system is outlined in Figure 2b. Fluorescent staining of ciliated cells, goblet cells, and basal cells (Figure
2c), as well as a cross-section of the pseudostratified epithelial layer (Figure 2d) are shown for a typical
airway tissue within a single device of PREDICT96-ALI. Our observations for airway tissues in the
PREDICT96-ALI platform regarding the relative populations of ciliated cells, basal cells, and goblet cells are
consistent with our previously reported observations in earlier generations of our airway models [23].

PREDICT96-ALI airway model supports infection with influenza A virus
Next, we examined the effect of inoculation of airway ALI cultures with various strains of IAV, including
A/WSN/33 H1N1, A/California/04/09 H1N1, and A/Hong Kong/8/68 H3N2. In Figure 3a,
immunofluorescence (IF) staining of ALI culture devices inoculated with various MOIs of A/WSN/33 are
shown, demonstrating greater abundance of IAV nucleoprotein (NP) as the MOI increases. In Figure 3b,
20x images at the apical plane show IAV NP staining across the range of 0.1 – 10 MOI, with levels increasing
substantially as the MOI rises from 0.1 to 1 and again from 1 to 10.

Measurements of supernatant viral RNA were obtained using qRT-PCR, and are provided in the three
panels in Figure 4. Viral copy numbers after inoculation at MOI of 0.1 and 1 were measured at 24 and 48
h p.i. for the A/WSN/33 strain of IAV (Figure 4a). In Figure 4b and 4c, companion results for
A/California/04/09 H1N1 and A/Hong Kong/8/68 H3N2 are shown, respectively. For the H1N1 and H3N2
strains, viral copies per mL rise monotonically with MOI, and continue to increase between 24 and 48 h
p.i. For the WSN strain, viral copies per mL show a large increase at MOI = 1, and are relatively flat after
24 h p.i.

Influenza A virus replication is reduced by oseltamivir in PREDICT96-ALI airway model
To determine if the PREDICT96-ALI airway model can be used to evaluate the efficacy of potential antiviral
therapeutics, we investigated the effect of the antiviral agent oseltamivir (Tamiflu) – the most commonly
used clinical anti-influenza therapy – for its ability to reduce viral load in IAV-inoculated PREDICT96-ALI
airway tissue. The active form of oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, was introduced 2 h before viral
inoculation and maintained in the bottom channel of the PREDICT96-ALI airway tissues during the course
of infection with A/WSN/33 H1N1 virus at various MOIs. Oseltamivir (1 μM) significantly reduced influenza
replication up to 48 h p.i. (Figure 5) relative to control tissue devices for the A/WSN/33 H1N1 strain at
MOI = 1 and prevented virus-induced disruption to barrier function and epithelial tight junction formation
(data not shown). Measurements for viral copies made in the PREDICT96-ALI airway model reflect those
made in clinical settings among patients exposed to influenza and treated with oseltamivir [32,33,34,35],
suggesting that the PREDICT96-ALI airway model can serve as a preclinical tool to evaluate potential
therapies for combating respiratory infections of the human airway.

ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcript expression in PREDICT96-ALI airway model
In preparation for testing the viral respiratory infection model with coronaviruses, we probed for
transcript expression of cell surface proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2 known to play central roles in facilitating
viral infection by SARS-CoV-2 [36]. Both HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2 gain entry into host cells via the ACE2
receptor, while TMPRSS2 facilitates SARS-CoV infection via cleavage mechanisms, and thus its presence is
an important aspect of the model. Data for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcripts for cell populations derived
from two different donors are plotted on a semi-logarithmic scale in Figure 6. Data from each donor
evaluated suggest a lack of statistical difference in transcript expression in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 between
donors. The consistency between these key cellular factors among different donors is encouraging, as it
suggests that the platform is capable of supporting proliferation and maturation of tissues derived from
numerous donors. Thus, evaluation of many donors can be accommodated in the PREDICT96-ALI system
both as a healthy model and in the presence of pathogenic challenge.

PREDICT96-ALI airway model supports infection with human coronavirus NL63
We have also investigated viral infection with HCoV-NL63 in the PREDICT96-ALI culture system with
primary NHBEs, as shown in Figures 7a and 7b for two different donor cell populations. In each case, viral
copies in the supernatant were measured with qRT-PCR over periods extending to 96 h p.i. and across a
range of MOIs. We observed a clear increase in viral load over these time periods for both donors,
indicating the presence of viral propagation in the airway tissues. Viral copies rose sharply from 0 to 48 h
for each MOI tested, while from 48 to 96 h the rate of viral propagation decreased and differed between
the two donors.

Discussion
In this work, we leverage the PREDICT96-ALI platform to create a high-throughput airway infection model
to assist in the development of therapeutics to treat infections. To do so, we developed a barrier tissue
model at an ALI with human primary tracheobronchial cells, establishing a pseudostratified epithelium,
and cultured atop a semipermeable membrane with independent flow control for each device in the
bottom channel. The data presented demonstrate a robust model for the human airway using primary
tracheobronchial epithelial cells, with an appropriate distribution of cell populations of ciliated, basal, and

goblet cells and a pseudostratified epithelial layer morphology. This airway model was applied to the
investigation of respiratory viral infections including IAV and HCoV-NL63, and infection kinetics were
evaluated across several viral strains, donor populations, MOIs and time points. Experiments conducted
with multiple donor populations of NHBE cells suggest the potential of this system for conducting studies
of donor-dependent mechanisms of infection and responses to therapeutic interventions. Key advantages
of this platform over existing in vitro platforms include the use of human primary tracheobronchial
epithelial cells cultured at an ALI, a more physiologically relevant cell-to-media ratio than standard
Transwell culture, integrated pumping of basal media to maintain precision control over solute
concentration and to avoid the development of non-physiological gradients, and compatibility with high
resolution and real-time imaging during dynamic pumping. While current organ-on-chip models possess
some of these advantages, they are typically low-throughput systems that are designed for research
environments and are often incompatible with workflows and standard instrumentation in
pharmaceutical laboratories. Considering the throughput limitations of the competing organ-on-chip
models, the PREDICT96-ALI platform offers an unmatched throughput that enables large combinations of
conditions, such as evaluation of three therapeutics across four MOIs and time points with two viral strains
and four replicates for each condition simultaneously on a single plate. The PREDICT96-ALI platform
combines the high throughput, precision control and physiological relevance necessary to serve as a
powerful tool for applications in disease modeling, drug development, and screening.

A critically important need in the field of respiratory virus research is the establishment of robust in vitro
disease models that provide the precision, validation, throughput, and utility necessary for routine
operation in drug development laboratories. Until recently, in vitro models suitable for the study of
respiratory viral infections have been either high-throughput but simplistic 2D culture plate-based
systems utilizing cell lines, or low-throughput and complex organ-on-chip models that are difficult to
accommodate in the workflow of many laboratories. The PREDICT96 platform has been reported
previously, and represents the first high-throughput organ-on-a-chip platform with integrated precision
flow control in a standard ANSI SLAS (American National Standards Institute / Society for Laboratory
Automation and Screening) well plate format [25]. Here, we deployed the airway tissue model successfully
in the PREDICT96-ALI platform to investigate infections of three different strains of IAV; the A/WSN/33
strain and pandemic strains of H1N1 and H3N2. Infections were monitored using a combination of IF and
qRT-PCR, across a range of MOIs and time points, providing a strong foundation for evaluation of

therapeutic interventions. As a proof of concept, oseltamivir dosing of the PREDICT96-ALI airway model
was shown to reduce viral copies of A/WSN/33 H1N1, demonstrating the potential of this system for
screening therapeutic compounds for respiratory viruses.

Our human airway tissue model has applicability to respiratory viruses including coronaviruses, and we
have demonstrated the relevance of this model to monitoring pathogen infection kinetics. To investigate
the applicability of our model to novel viral pathogens, we examined the ability of HCoV-NL63, an alpha
coronavirus sharing the same host entry receptor as SARS-CoV-2, to infect and replicate within
PREDICT96-ALI.We both confirmed the presence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcripts in the primary human
cells within our model and successfully infected the PREDICT96-ALI airway model with HCoV-NL63 across
a range of MOIs and for two different donor human primary epithelial cell populations. This
demonstration of infection with HCoV-NL63 represents an important new capability for modeling
coronavirus infections and potentially evaluating therapeutics, extending beyond current approaches that
use cell lines in high-throughput systems or human primary lung cells in low-throughput Transwell
formats. These data demonstrate the promise of the PREDICT96-ALI airway model as a new capability for
preclinical evaluation of therapeutics for respiratory infections including SARS-CoV-2 in an efficient,
robust, and high-throughput manner.
