Abstract:

Effective therapeutics are urgently needed to counter infection and improve outcomes for patients
suffering from COVID-19 and to combat this pandemic. Manipulation of epigenetic machinery to influence
viral infectivity of host cells is a relatively unexplored area. The bromodomain and extraterminal (BET)
family of epigenetic readers have been reported to modulate SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we
demonstrate apabetalone, the most clinical advanced BET inhibitor, downregulates expression of cell
surface receptors involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and
dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26) in SARS-CoV-2 permissive cells. Moreover, we show that
apabetalone inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro to levels comparable to antiviral agents. Taken
together, our study supports further evaluation of apabetalone to treat COVID-19, either alone or in
combination with emerging therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the novel coronavirus
disease of 2019 (COVID-19) 1, a pandemic that has caused more than 2 million deaths worldwide, and
continues to be a public health emergency 2. Infected patients present with a wide range of clinical
manifestations, including cough, fatigue, and temperature dysregulation (fever / chills) 3. Unfortunately,
10-20% of infected patients progress to severe disease requiring hospitalization, and ~5% of patients
become critically ill 4. Moreover, ~10-50% patients have long-term health consequences following acute
SARS-CoV-2infection that impact cognitive, cardiovascular, and renal function

5-7

. A dysregulated

hyperinflammatory immune response, or cytokine storm, causes harmful widespread tissue damage and
is strongly associated with rapidly deteriorating outcomes - viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS), severe lung injury, multi-organ failure and ultimately death 1, 8. The high rate of COVID19 complications and mortality underscore the urgent need for effective therapies, not only to reduce the
severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and improve outcomes, but to support ongoing vaccination efforts that
may be compromised by emerging variants of the virus.

SARS-CoV-2 is typically transmitted through the inhalation of aerosols and respiratory droplets 9. Infection
is initiated by binding of the viral spike protein to the transmembrane receptor angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells, followed by fusion of the viral coat with the cell membrane

10, 11

. ACE2

expressing cells in the respiratory track are the first to be infected 12. In later stages of infection, SARSCoV-2 spreads systemically into ACE2 abundant cell types outside of the lung (e.g., kidney, liver, and
gastrointestinal tract)

13-15

. Disrupting spike protein - ACE2 interactions has been the target of

experimental COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccine development 10, 16-18. Currently approved vaccines evoke
an immune response against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and show protective effects in reducing disease
severity

19, 20

. However, until mass vaccination efforts establish herd immunity, safe and effective

therapeutics are urgently required to limit the severity of symptoms and prevent necessity for medical
intervention arising in unvaccinated subjects, those who do not achieve protection from vaccination or in
response to emerging new high-transmission variants of SARS-CoV-2 21.

Recent evidence indicates that ACE2 expression is regulated by bromodomain and extraterminal (BET)
proteins in multiple cell types 22. BET proteins are epigenetic readers that bridge acetylation-dependent
binding sites and transcriptional machinery to regulate gene transcription via their tandem
bromodomains (BD) 1 and BD2 23. Inhibitors of BET proteins (BETi) have been reported to downregulate
ACE2 expression and limit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. However, pan-BETi that target BET
bromodomains with equal affinity generate side-effects and toxicity that limit their clinical application 24.
In contrast, apabetalone, an orally available BETi that preferentially targets BD2, is in phase 3 trials for
cardiovascular indications, and has an established, favorable safety profile 25, 26. Here we examined BETi
effects on viral infection in cell culture models to mimic initial sites of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as cell
types contributing to complications arising in late stages of infection. We show that apabetalone
downregulates ACE2 gene expression, protein levels and cellular binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in
cell culture models, and strikingly reduces infection with live SARS-CoV-2. DPP4 / CD26, a potential
cofactor for SARS-CoV-2 infection 27, 28, is also downregulated by apabetalone, with potential synergistic
effects with ACE2 reductions that block cellular SARS-CoV-2 uptake and infection. Together, our data
show that BET proteins are key pharmacological targets for COVID-19 treatment and further investigation
of apabetalone as a therapeutic to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection is warranted.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Chemical Compounds
Apabetalone and JQ1 were synthesized by NAEJA Pharmaceuticals (Edmonton, Canada) or IRIX
Pharmaceuticals (Florence, SC)

29

. MZ1 was acquired from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, UK). Camostat

mesylate and remdesivir were purchased from Selleck Chemicals and Cayman Chemical Co, respectively.
All compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) prior to introduction to cell culture media.

Cell Culture
All cell lines were incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere enriched with 5% CO 2 . Human bronchial
epithelial Calu-3 cells and African green monkey kidney epithelial Vero E6 cells (ATCC) were maintained in
complete medium (Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium [EMEM, ATCC]) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin and

eptomycin (P/S). HepG2 (ATCC) and Huh-7

(JCRB Cell Bank) were cultured in medium recommended by the suppliers. Human Karpas-299 T cells (a
kind gift from Dr. Iqbal, UNMC; originally from DMSZ) were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with
10% FBS and P/S. Cryopreserved primary human hepatocytes (PHH) were plated as directed (CellzDirect,
Life Technologies), and then treated with compounds in media containing 10% FBS (v/v) but without the
dexamethasone recommended by Life Technologies.

Real-time PCR
Cells were treated with BETi compounds or vehicle (DMSO) in complete medium for up to 96 hours.
Following treatment, cells were harvested, and transcripts quantified via TaqMan real-time PCR as
previously described

30, 31

. Briefly, mRNA was isolated using mRNA Catcher™ PLUS purification kits

according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher). Taqman PCR assays were obtained from
Applied Biosystems / Life Technologies. Real-time PCR was used to determine abundance of the transcript

of interest relative to the endogenous reference gene, cyclophilin in a duplex reaction using the RNA
Ultrasense One-step qRT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher). Data was acquired using a ViiA-7 Real-Time PCR
apparatus (Applied Biosystems). The analysis was performed as 2^ (C T cyclophilin – C T transcript of interest) and results
were normalized to DMSO treated samples.

Immunoblot Analysis
Calu-3 or Vero E6 cells treated with BETi for 48 hours were lysed and sonicated as previously described 31.
Cell lysates were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and
proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked and incubated with
anti-ACE2 (R&D Systems AF933) or anti-GAPDH (Cell Signaling 5174) antibodies overnight at 4°C, followed
by incubation with corresponding HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad or Abcam) for 1 h at
room temperature. Actin was stained with an anti- -ACTIN antibody conjugated directly to peroxidase
(Sigma A3854). Proteins of interest were visualized on a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP imager with Enhanced
Chemiluminescence Plus (GE Healthcare) or SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate
(Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ImageJ or Quantity 4.6.9 (Bio-Rad) software
were used for densitometric quantification of bands in immunoblots 32.

Flow Cytometry
Cells surface ACE2 protein was stained with Alex Flour® 647-conjugated human ACE2 antibody (R&D
Systems FAB933R). Live/Dead (Invitrogen) or Zombie (Bio-Legend) viability dyes were included to gate
viable cells. Cell surface ACE2 protein levels were measured on a BD FACSCelesta (BD Biosciences) and
analyzed with FlowJo version 10 software (BD Biosciences).

SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Binding

Post BETi treatment, cells were detached with Accutase (Thermo Fisher), washed, and incubated with
recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) fused to the human IgG1 Fc
domain (R&D Systems 10499-CV-100) or control recombinant human IgG1 Fc protein (R&D Systems
10499-CV-100) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed and incubated with PEconjugated goat anti-human Fc antibodies (Thermo Fisher 12-4998-82) for 30 min at 4°C. Spike-RBD
binding was measured by flow cytometry on a BD FACSCelesta (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo
software.

MTS Proliferation Assay
MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] assays
were used to determine BETi-induced cytotoxicity. Briefly, Calu-3 (~20,000 cells/well), Vero E6
(~10,000/well), or Karpas-299 (~20,000 cells/well) were treated with vehicle (DMSO) or increasing
amounts of BETi for 48 h in 96-well plates, and then the CellTiter 96® AQueous assay (Promega) was
preformed according to the manufacturer's instructions to determine cell proliferation. Absorbance signal
from each well was acquired at 490 nm on a Tecan Infinite® M1000 Pro microplate reader (Männedorf,
Switzerland).

SARS-CoV-2 Infection of Calu-3 cells
SARS-CoV-2 (strain BEI_USA-WA1/2020) was obtained from the BEI and propagated in Vero E6 cells. All
live virus experiments were performed in the BSL3 laboratory at the University of Nebraska Medical
Center (Omaha, USA). Briefly, Calu-3 (~20,000 cells/well) were seeded in 96 well plates and cultured in
complete medium overnight. Cells were pre-treated with BETi, camostat mesylate, or remdesivir for up
to 48 h at 37°C. Treatments were washed off and cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 0.1 in complete media. Cells were fixed 48 h post-infection with 4% buffered
paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 15 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were

washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X solution for 15 min, then
blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin-PBS solution. The cells were incubated with anti-Spike protein Rab
(Sino Biological) at 1:1000 in blocking solution overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation with 1:2000 diluted
Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher) for 1 h at room temperature. Cell nuclei
were counterstained using Hoechst 33342 and cytoplasmic membranes were stained with CellMask
(Invitrogen). Internal control conditions were included in each plate (i.e., untreated virus infected and
non-infected cells). Cells were imaged using a high content analysis system, Operetta CLS (PerkinElmer).
Percentage inhibition of viral infection and cell viability (i.e., treatment-induced cytotoxicity) were
calculated using Harmony 4.9 software.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical significance was determined through one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple
comparison test. Comparisons were done vs. vehicle control and p<0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

RESULTS

Apabetalone downregulates ACE2 gene expression in multiple cell types
ACE2 mediates SARS-CoV-2 attachment and entry to host cells 10, 11, and ACE2 gene expression may be
driven by BET proteins 22. Therefore, we investigated the effect of apabetalone on ACE2 gene expression
in SARS-CoV-2 permissible cell lines including human lung epithelial cells; Calu-3, and monkey kidney
epithelial cells; Vero E6. In Calu-3 cells, 48 h of apabetalone treatment resulted in dose dependent
reduction in hACE2 transcripts by up to 90%, p<0.001 (Fig. 1A). In Vero E6, 24 h of 5 µM and 20 µM
apabetalone treatment resulted in reduction of RhACE2 transcripts by ~40% (p<0.001) and 80% (p<0.001)
respectively (Fig. 1B). As ACE2 is expressed outside of the lung in tissues also susceptible to SARS-CoV-2

infection 33, 34, we assessed ACE2 gene expression in extrapulmonary cells. A dose dependent decrease in
hACE2 mRNA was observed in apabetalone treated liver cell culture systems including HepG2 and Huh-7
hepatocarcinoma cells (Fig. 1C-D) and PHH derived from 3 donors of different ages and genders (Fig. 1E;
PHH donor characteristics in Supplemental Table S1). BETi with different chemical scaffolds and
mechanism of action were included as positive controls: JQ1 is a pan-BETi with equal affinity for BET
bromodomains BD1 and BD2 35, while MZ1 is a proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) that directs BET
proteins for degradation 36. Each BETi, including apabetalone, promoted downregulation of ACE2 gene
expression in the cell types tested (Fig. 1), confirming BET proteins play a pivotal role in the regulation of
ACE2 gene expression in a variety of cell types.

Apabetalone reduces ACE2 protein levels in Calu-3 and Vero E6
Immunoblots examining total cell lysates showed that 48 h of BETi treatment reduced ACE2 protein in
Calu-3 cells by 40-50% (Fig. 2A and Fig. S4) and in Vero E6 by 25-50% (Fig. 2B and Fig. S5). As membrane
bound ACE2 protein is critical for SARS-CoV-2 entry 10, BETi effects on ACE2 abundance on the cell surface
were assessed using flow cytometry (Fig. 2C-E). In Calu-3 cells, 72 h of apabetalone treatment dose
dependently reduced the amount of cell surface ACE2 levels by up to 84%, p<0.001 (Fig. 2D). JQ1 or MZ1
treatments also reduced ACE2 protein levels, indicating reduction in ACE2 was an on-target effect of BETi,
and consistent with downregulation of hACE2 gene expression (Fig. 1B).

Vero E6 cells responded similarly to BETi treatment: apabetalone (25 µM) reduced cell surface expression
of ACE2 by ~40%, p=0.047 (Fig. 2E). Thus, BETi treatment lowered the abundance of ACE2 in both lung
and kidney cells, with potential to impede SARS-CoV-2 infection or replication, as cells that do not express
ACE2 have low susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection 10.

Apabetalone downregulates DPP4 (CD26) expression

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.10.432949; this version posted March 11, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

CD26 (gene name DPP4) is a potential cofactor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, as its presence on the
cell surface facilitates viral attachment 27, 28. In Calu-3 cells, 48 h of apabetalone treatment resulted in dose
dependent downregulation in DPP4 mRNA (up to 65%, p<0.001 Fig. S1A), in line with reduction of cell
surface CD26 (up to 40% reduction, p<0.001 Fig. S1B). Cell surface CD26 was also reduced with 48 h of
BETi treatment in Karpas-299 T cells (Fig. S1C). JQ1 and MZ1 evoked similar responses, indicating BET
proteins regulate DPP4 / CD26 expression in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells and Karpas-299 T cells.

Apabetalone attenuates SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding
To model viral association with host cells, we measured binding of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
receptor-binding domain fused with the human IgG1 Fc-epitope (spike-RBD) to Calu-3 or Vero E6 cells.
Apabetalone pre-treatment for 72 h dose dependently attenuated the amount of spike-RBD protein
bound to Calu-3 cells by more than 80% (Fig. 3A-B, p<0.001). The comparator BETi, MZ1 and JQ1, were
also efficacious.

In Vero E6 cells, 48 h of apabetalone pre-treatment reduced the amount of spike-RBD binding up to 45%,
p=0.002 (Fig. 3C). Together, these results indicate BET inhibitors reduce levels of SARS-CoV-2 spike-protein
association with host cells capable of propagating the virus.

Apabetalone abrogates SARS-CoV-2 infection
Lung epithelial Calu-3 cells are known to support infection of SARS-CoV-2

37

. Given the substantial

reduction in spike-RBD binding, BETi may impede infection by SARS-CoV-2. To test this, Calu-3 cells were
pre-treated with BETi for 48 h, washed, then infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 48 h (Fig. 4A). Remarkably, viral
replication was significantly impaired in cells pre-treated for 48 h with 20 µM apabetalone and remained
55-75% efficacious at concentrations below 5 µM (Fig. 4B,D). Though ACE2 mRNA and levels of cell surface
ACE2 recovered somewhat during the SARS-CoV-2 infection period (Fig. S2), viral replication remained

markedly suppressed. Remdesivir, a ribonucleotide analogue that inhibits viral RNA polymerases 38, also
abolished SARS-CoV-2 replication as expected (Fig. 4B). Prior to binding ACE2, the viral spike protein is
primed via proteolytic cleavage by the host cell transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) 10. Camostat
mesylate is a serine protease inhibitor that targets TMPRSS2 39. Pre-treatment of Calu-3 cells with 2.5 to
50 µM camostat mesylate prevented viral infection completely and reinforce how spike protein priming
is a required step to initiate infection. Importantly, compound treatments were not toxic (Fig. 4C).
Together, apabetalone was equally effective at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection as agents that target viral
entry or genome replication.

DISCUSSION

SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated via SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interactions with ACE2 in cells along the
respiratory tract, and uptake may be facilitated by cofactors like DPP4 / CD26 as it is for other
coronaviruses 27. Viral infection leads to cytopathic injury as viral infection spreads to ACE2 expressing cell
types outside of the lung

13-15

. In severe disease, excessive, uncontrolled production of inflammatory

mediators generates a cytokine storm and potential for multiorgan dysfunction 40. In this study, we report
apabetalone, the most clinically advanced BETi with BD2 selectivity, reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell
culture models through downregulation of viral uptake receptors. Previous studies have demonstrated
apabetalone suppresses activation of innate and adaptive immune responses

31, 41-44

, and thus

apabetalone may reduce both SARS-CoV-2 infection and control hyperinflammatory conditions associated
with poor outcomes in a dual mechanism of action.

BET proteins contain two tandem bromodomains, BD1 and BD2, that bind acetylated lysine on histone
tails and transcription factors

biological consequences 46, 47. Apabetalone is a BETi that preferentially targets BD2, which differentiates
it from pan-BETi, including JQ1

35, 48

. Toxicities have arisen in clinical trials with pan-BETi, necessitating

close monitoring of patients and modified treatment schedules 24. Apabetalone is generally well tolerated
and in phase 3 clinical development for cardiovascular and renal indications 25, 26, 49, 50.

Previous reports have indicated ACE2 gene expression is regulated by BET proteins

22

. In this study,

apabetalone treatment resulted in robust and dose dependent downregulation of ACE2 gene expression
in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells (Fig. 1A; >85% maximal reductions in mRNA levels), as well as extrapulmonary
cell types derived from the kidney and liver (Fig. 1B-E; >80% maximal reductions in mRNA levels). As a
result, apabetalone dose dependently lowered cell surface ACE2 abundance on Calu-3 (Fig. 2; up to 84%
reductions) and Vero E6 (up to 40%) that corresponded to reductions in ACE2 gene expression. Lower
levels of cell surface ACE2 were in parallel with diminished binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to cells
treated with BETi compounds, including BD2 selective apabetalone, pan-BETi JQ1 and a BET degrader MZ1
(Fig. 3), indicating a BET protein dependent mechanisms lead to binding of viral spike protein. Strikingly,
48 h of apabetalone pre-treatment at 20 µM nearly abolished infection of Calu-3 cells and remained
efficacious at concentrations below 1 µM (Fig. 4B). Reduction in cell surface ACE2 levels was sustained 48
h after BETi withdraw (Fig. S2B-C), which likely account for the profound inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection
after pre-treatment. The positive controls we used in the viral replication assay, remdesivir and camostat
mesylate, were 100% effective in blocking SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 4B), but their clinical utility is unclear.
Remdesivir has been FDA approved for COVID-19 in those who are hospitalized with severe symptoms,
despite the World Health Organization reporting the drug had little to no effect on 28 day mortality and
did not delay the need for ventilation or shorten patients’ stay in hospital

51

. Camostat mesylate, a

protease inhibitor that prevents proteolytic priming of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein by TMPRSS2 to enable
ACE2 binding, is still under investigation as an intervention for COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers

to Calu-3 cells at the concentrations applied in the current study (Fig. S3).

Taken together, our results show apabetalone reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro and suggest benefit
of apabetalone in COVID-19 pathology arising in ACE2 expressing cell types. Direct infection of the heart
remains enigmatic; however, a recent report has described apabetalone-mediated downregulation of
ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection / propagation in a 2-D human cardiac myocyte model (Mills,
R.J. et al. in preprint https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.23.258574) and suggests benefit of apabetalone in
preventing COVID-19 associated cardiac damage. ACE2 converts angiotensin II (Ang II), a hormone that
increases blood pressure, into angiotensin (1-7), a vasodilator that lowers blood pressure 52. Therefore,
downregulation of ACE2 could result in an increase of Ang II and hypertension, however, blood pressure
was not altered by apabetalone treatment in clinical trials 26, 53-55.

DPP4 (CD26) is a membrane-anchored protease linked to diabetes and implicated as a cofactor in SARSCoV-2 uptake 27. DPP4 inhibitors (DPP4i) have been developed for diabetic glucose control 56, and are
being investigated for treatment of COVID-19 patients with pre-existing diabetic conditions
(ClinicalTrails.gov identifier NCT04542213). CD26 is also linked to T cell activation and DPP4i have been
shown to suppress T cell proliferation and production of proinflammatory cytokines

57

. In our study,

apabetalone downregulated DPP4 gene expression and CD26 cell surface protein levels in human Calu-3
lung cells and Karpas-299 T cells (Fig. S1), in agreement with a recent report confirming BET mediated
regulation of DPP4 expression

37

. The data imply therapeutic benefit through reduced viral uptake

facilitated by CD26 as well as attenuation of aberrant inflammatory processes associated with severe
COVID-19.

In patients with SARS-CoV-2, circulating monocytes and infiltrating macrophages increase in number,
which may explain elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, tumor
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- ), and IL-8 1. A cytokine storm can evolve, causing ARDS, multi-organ failure,
and even death. Several anti-inflammatory drugs have been evaluated in clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV2 with limited success 1. However, BETi may be more effective with dual anti-viral and anti-inflammatory
properties. In vitro, apabetalone treatment reduced proinflammatory gene expression in vascular
endothelial cells

. Apabetalone also reduced

vascular inflammation in a mouse model 41 and countered cytokine driven acute phase responses both in
cell culture and in mice

43

. These preclinical results translated into clinical trials, where apabetalone

treatment was associated with reduction in multiple inflammatory markers in patient plasma

31, 43

. No

increase in infection or infestation rates in apabetalone treated patients occurred, indicating apabetalone
does not suppress immune function to levels that impair clearance of viral infections. Through antiinflammatory properties, apabetalone may favorably suppress hyperimmune processes leading to ARDS
and mortality in COVID-19 infections. Further, BETi including apabetalone, improved cardiovascular
dysfunction induced by inflammatory mediators found prominently in the COVID-19 cytokine storm in a
cardiac organoid model (Mills, R.J. et al. in preprint https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.23.258574), and
suggest benefit on COVID-19 associated inflammation in the heart. Together apabetalone may counter
overproduction of specific inflammatory mediators that drive the cytokine storm associated with poor
outcomes in COVID-19.

Apabetalone has undergone extensive clinical evaluation. To date, the drug has been administered to
1934 subjects in completed phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical studies including 138 healthy volunteers, 576 patients
with stable coronary artery disease, dyslipidaemia and/or pre-diabetes, on standard of care background

therapy, 1212 patients with diabetes and acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and 8 patients with stage 4-5
chronic kidney disease (Resverlogix Corp., compiled data). Overall, apabetalone is well tolerated by
patients; adverse events were generally mild with little discernible difference between placebo- and
active-treated subjects. The dose-limiting adverse event for apabetalone is a non-symptomatic elevation
in serum transaminases (alanine transaminase and in some cases aspartate transaminase) without
adversely affecting serum bilirubin in any subjects.

With a well-established safety profile, apabetalone is a novel, clinical trial ready candidate for the
treatment of COVID-19 based on a dual mechanism of action that simultaneously lowers ACE2-mediated
SARS-CoV-2 infection and combats hyper-inflammatory responses that underlie severe disease. Future
clinical trials will evaluate apabetalone on top of standard of care to prevent advance of COVID-19 severity
and improve outcomes.

***p<0.001, one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test.

Figure 2. BETi treatment reduced both surface and total ACE2 protein levels.
A, Immunoblot of total ACE2 protein in Calu-3 cells following BETi treatment for 48 h. Values below the
blots are indicative of band quantification via densitometric analysis (ACE2 / -ACTIN) and are represented
as fold change to vehicle treated cells (0.05% v/v DMSO). B, Immunoblot of total ACE2 protein in Vero E6
cells following BETi treatment for 48 h. Values below the blot are indicative of band quantification via
densitometric analysis (ACE2 / GAPDH) and are represented as fold change to vehicle treated cells (0.1%
v/v DMSO). C, Representative histogram from flow cytometry showing overlay of cell surface ACE2 on
Calu-3 cells following 48 h of the indicated treatments. D-E, Quantification of ACE2 protein levels on Calu3 (D; n=3) or Vero E6 (E, n=5) following BETi treatment for 72 h. ACE2 surface expression is shown as mean
fluorescent intensity (MFI) ratio to isotype control (D-E). Error bars represent SD (n=3). *p<0.05, **p<0.01,
***p<0.001, one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison test.

Figure 3. BET inhibition decreased SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD binding to Calu-3 and Vero E6.
A, A histogram overlay representing the binding of SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD Fc fusion protein to Calu-3
following 48 h of apabetalone or JQ1 treatment at the indicated concentrations. B-C, Quantification of
BETi-driven changes to SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD binding to Calu-3 (B; n=3) or Vero E6 (C; n=3) cells. Binding

Figure 4. BETi compounds diminished SARS-CoV-2 infection in Calu-3.
A, Schematic illustration of SARS-CoV-2 infection assay design. Briefly, cells were pre-treated with BETi
(apabetalone or JQ1), comparator/control compounds [camostat mesylate (Camostat) or remdesivir] or
vehicle control (DMSO 0.1% v/v) for 48 h. Treatments were washed off and cells were then infected with
SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1. 48 h-post-infection, Calu-3 cells were fixed and stained for Spike protein.
B, Percent inhibition of viral infectivity by BETi pre-treatment in Calu-3 cells (blue bars). C, Compoundinduced cytotoxicity in viral infected Calu-3 cells is shown in grey bars (n=3 independent experiments).
D, Representative immunofluorescence images of virus infection in Calu-3 cells for the treatments and
indicated concentrations. Scale bar = 100
