Abstract
Vaccine development against the SARS-CoV-2 virus focuses on the principal target of the
neutralizing immune response, the spike (S) glycoprotein. Adenovirus-vectored vaccines offer
an effective platform for the delivery of viral antigen, but it is important for the generation of
neutralizing antibodies that they produce appropriately processed and assembled viral antigen
that mimics that observed on the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Here, we describe the structure,
conformation and glycosylation of the S protein derived from the adenovirus-vectored
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222 vaccine. We demonstrate native-like post-translational
processing and assembly, and reveal the expression of S proteins on the surface of cells
adopting the trimeric prefusion conformation. The data presented here confirms the use of
ChAdOx1 adenovirus vectors as a leading platform technology for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

Introduction
Vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are an
essential countermeasure to stem the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccine development efforts aim
to produce both a strong T cell response and a neutralizing immune response against the virus,
the main target being the spike (S) proteins that protrude from the viral envelope (1). The S
protein is responsible for mediating host-cell entry, with the S1 and S2 subunits facilitating
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively
(2–4). The SARS-CoV-2 S gene encodes the extensively glycosylated trimeric class I viral
fusion protein with 22 N-linked glycans per protomer (5).
Whilst the coronavirus S glycoprotein is the principal target for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
design, leading vaccine candidates and recently licensed vaccines utilise a variety of constructs
and strategies (6). For example, both Moderna’s mRNA-1273 and Pfizer’s BNT162b2 (7)

encodes full length S with two mutations to stabilise the prefusion conformation (8), and
Sinovac’s CoronaVac inactivated virus vaccine presents the wild-type S on the viral surface
(9), although the majority of spikes are in the postfusion conformation (10). One key aim for
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development is to elicit a robust immune response against the spike, and
more specifically the RBD, where many neutralizing epitopes are located (10–15). To this end,
many vaccine candidates include (two or more) stabilising mutations in the S protein, such that
the protein maintains the prefusion conformation and avoids shedding of S1 (3).
The replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV19/AZD1222 (hereafter referred to as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19), encodes the full-length wild-type
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 has previously been shown to elicit not only
strong neutralizing antibody responses, but also robust spike-specific T-cell responses (16–19).
Although adenovirus-vectored vaccines are a promising way to deliver viral glycoprotein
antigens, the processing and presentation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is yet to be characterised.
Understanding the molecular features of the expressed viral antigen is important for the
interpretation of the immune response to this vaccine. Here, we determine the native-like
functionality, prefusion trimeric structure and glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 S protein
expressed from the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine.
Results and Discussion
Expression of prefusion conformation SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein on cell surfaces upon
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 infection
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 encodes a wild-type S sequence, including the transmembrane
domains, which is trafficked to the cell surface with a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) signal
sequence (Fig. 1A). Using flow cytometry, we first detected the presence of the S glycoprotein
at the cell surface of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 infected HeLa S3 cells (Fig. 1B-E). Sera from mice
vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was used to detect the expression level of S at the cell
surface, revealing ~60-70% of all cells expressing S (range of duplicate averages across three
experimental repeats) (Sup. Fig. 1). A ChAdOx1 vaccine encoding an irrelevant filovirus
antigen (EBOV) was used as a negative control (20), which showed a low level of binding to
the anti-ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine serum (~0.5-2% cells across all experiments). This
observation accounts for antibodies raised against the vector itself rather that the vaccine
antigen. Subsequently, we sought to examine the properties of the cell surface expressed S
protein using recombinant ACE2 and a panel of human mAbs which bind to specific regions

of S (Fig. 1B). Binding of infected cells to recombinant ACE2 confirms the correct folding of
S and native presentation and functionality of the RBD (Fig. 1B). This observation is further
supported by the binding of the human mAbs, in particular Ab45 which recognises RBD, Ab71
which recognises the trimeric spike and Ab111 which recognises the NTD. Ab44 which
recognises S2 also demonstrates considerable binding. These data confirm significant presence
of the prefusion trimer at the cell surface. In the absence of a postfusion specific anti-S2
antibody we were unable to quantify if some postfusion spike is present at the cell surface.
Whilst this observation that the majority of cells infected with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19
present native-like spikes on the cell surface (Fig. 1B), it is interesting to note that a population
may shed the S1 subunit. Whether this is a beneficial or detrimental feature with respect to the
elicitation of immune responses during vaccination is unknown. Shedding of S1 subunits from
viruses occurs during native infection (21–24), and the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19-derived S proteins
mimics this native feature of the viral spike. Nevertheless it has been shown that vaccination
with ChAdOx nCoV-19 elicits robust antibody and T cell responses (16–19).

Structural analysis of membrane-associated ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 derived SARS-CoV-2 S
protein
After the surface expression of the S protein driven by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vector
infection was confirmed by cytometry, we sought to probe the structure of S proteins on native
cell surfaces using cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging (cryoET STA). We
imaged U2OS and HeLa cells infected with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. These cells were chosen for
the thin cell peripheries which make them accessible for cryoET analysis. The tomograms
revealed that surface of the cells is densely covered with protruding densities consistent with
the size and shape to the prefusion conformation of SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Fig. 2A & 2B,
movie 1). These densities are absent in control uninfected cells (Sup. Fig. 2). To determine
whether these spikes represent the SARS-CoV-2 prefusion spike, we performed subtomogram
averaging of 11391 spikes from cell surfaces using emClarity (25). The averaged density map,
with three-fold symmetry applied, is at 11.6 Å resolution (at 0.5 FSC cut-off) (Fig. 2C),
resolving the overall spike structure, which overlaps very well with prefusion spike atomic
models in the literature (4, 26–29) (Fig. 2D & 2E). We subsequently preformed cryoimmunolabelling using ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinated mice sera which confirmed the

presentation of abundant S protein on the cell surface, but not on control cells infected with
ChAdOx-GFP or uninfected cells (Sup. Fig. 3).
In order to investigate the presence of post-fusion S protein conformations, we
employed template searching for pre- and post-fusion spikes on cells infected with ChAdOx
nCoV-19 (Sup. Fig. 4). This analysis revealed a presence of abundant pre-fusion spikes on the
cell surface, while little post-fusion spikes are detected. Given the lack of a post-fusion
conformation specific anti-S2 antibody, we were not able to probe, by cryo-immunolabelling,
post-fusion spikes on the surface of cells.
The presentation of prefusion S proteins was achieved through encoding SARS-CoV-2
S protein in the ChAdOx1 backbone without the incorporation of stabilising mutations. Given
that most neutralizing antibodies target epitopes displayed on the prefusion spike, the cryoET
analysis revealing the expression of trimeric SARS-CoV-2 spike in the prefusion conformation
strongly supports ChAdOx nCoV-19 as an effective vaccine strategy for the generation of a
neutralizing immune response.

Site-specific glycan analysis of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 derived SARS-CoV-2 S protein reveals
native-like glycan maturation
The SARS-CoV-2 S gene encodes 22 N-linked glycosylation sequons which span both
the S1 and S2 subunits (Fig. 1A). These host-derived glycans mask immunogenic protein
epitopes from the humoral immune system; a common strategy utilised by viruses to evade the
immune system (30). It is therefore of considerable importance that spike proteins produced
upon vaccination successfully recapitulates the glycosylation observed on the virus, since
antibodies may be elicited against protein epitopes that are occluded during natural infection.
We sought to resolve the site-specific glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins produced by
cells following infection with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. To this end, human embryonic kidney 293
F (HEK293F) cells were incubated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Western blot analysis of the
protein pellets from the cell lysates using both S1- and S2- specific antibodies confirmed the
presence and maturation of the S protein into the S1 and S2 subunits following furin cleavage.
Since the whole cell was lysed, intracellular material of uncleaved S0 protein was also detected
(Fig. 3A). These gel bands were excised and analysed by liquid-chromatography-mass
spectrometry (LC-MS) separately.
To determine the site-specific glycosylation and glycan occupancy of the spike protein,
we employed trypsin, chymotrypsin, alpha-lytic protease to generate glycopeptide samples. In
order to increase the signal intensity of the glycopeptides, these samples were treated
sequentially with Endoglycosidase H to cleave oligomannose- and hybrid-type glycans
between the core GlcNAc residues, leaving a single GlcNAc attached to the Asn residue
(+203Da). Subsequent PNGase F treatment removed the remaining complex-type glycans
which deamidates the Asn to Asp resulting in a +3 Da shift as the reaction was conducted in
O18 water (31–33). This homogenisation of the glycans into oligomannose/hybrid-type and
complex-type glycan categories was performed in order to increase coverage of across the S
protein. The mass of peptides with unoccupied glycan sites exhibit no mass shift. The resulting

subjected to LC-MS analysis (Fig. 3B).

content with glycan sites labelled in green (80-100%), orange (30-79%), pink (0-29%) or grey
(not detected).

The glycans presented on this S0 immature form of the protein were predominantly
underprocessed oligomannose/hybrid-type glycans (85%) (Sup. Table 1), which reflects the
intracellular origin of the protein, yet to be trafficked through to the cell membrane. This is
consistent with furin protease being located in the trans-Golgi apparatus. In contrast, the
cleaved S1/S2 protein, likely to be presented on the surface of cells, possesses significantly
lower levels of these underprocessed glycans (56%) and elevated levels of complex-type
glycans (38%). Furthermore, high levels of glycan occupancy were observed across the protein.
This is especially important since glycans are known to shield more immunogenic protein
epitopes, thus the expression of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins using the ChAdOx1 vaccine platform
results in presentation of epitopes similar to those seen during natural infection (5, 30, 34). We
note that the overall levels of oligomannose/hybrid-type glycans on the S1/S2 protein were
elevated compared previous analyses, however we attribute this to the lack of coverage of the
glycosylation sites towards the C-terminus which are predominantly complex-type on
recombinant proteins and viruses (5, 27, 35).
Using the cryo-EM structure of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 S protein, we mapped the
glycosylation status of the S1/S2 protein (Fig. 3C). A mixture of oligomannose/hybrid and
complex-type sites were observed, with glycan sites such as N234, which are known to have
stabilising effects on the RBD, preserving the predominantly oligomannose state reported in
both recombinant proteins and viruses (5, 27, 35). Similarly, the glycan at N165 which also
stabilises the RBD “up” conformation was determined to be complex-type on the S protein
arising from infection of cells with ChAdOx1 nCoV19. Since glycans are sensitive reporters
of local protein architecture, it is encouraging that such glycans, known to have structural roles,
conserve their processing state which provides additional evidence of native-like prefusion
protein structure.
Adenoviruses have broad cell tropism due to the widespread distribution of their
cellular receptors such as coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) and CD46 (36, 37).
Replication-deficient adenovirus vectored vaccines, such as ChAdOx nCoV-19, are

in germinal centres of the lymph nodes. These APCs are both primed by direct adenovirus
infection or by cross-priming from non-immune cells (37).
During vaccination, SARS-CoV-2 S protein processing can be dependent on both the
receptors present on, and the enzymes expressed by the S-producing cells (38). Presence of the
cell entry receptor ACE2 and host-cell proteases including furin and TMPRSS2 can drive
conformational rearrangements resulting in post-fusion conformations of S. Tissue distribution
of ACE2 is primarily in the nasal mucosa and GI tracts, and TMPRSS2 is predominantly
expressed in lungs and GI tracts, where cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In
contrast, the muscle, fibroblast and immune cell types targeted by intramuscularly administered
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, have not been shown to express high levels of ACE2 or TMPRSS2 (39–
41). The cell lines chosen for this study of the higher order structure and conformation vaccinederived S (HeLa S3 and U20S) similarly do not express these enzymes in high abundance and
are therefore a suitable surrogate for this in vitro study. Although HEK293F cells are not a
natural host cell type in which the S protein would be expressed upon administration of
ChAdOx nCoV-19, due to the conservation of the enzymatic processing of the early stages of
the mammalian N-linked glycosylation pathway (42, 43), they represent a suitable model
system to study the nature of the carbohydrate modifications of the S protein. It may be useful
in future to examine vaccine derived antigen processing in primary cells or even biopsy
material, especially if alternative routes, such as intra-nasal administration, are considered.
Overall, this study provides holistic biophysical scrutiny of the spike protein that is
produced upon vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. Importantly, we reveal the native-like
mimicry of SARS-CoV-2 S protein’s receptor binding functionality, prefusion structure, and
processing of glycan modifications. Whilst there is some evidence of S1 subunit shedding, as
observed on the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus, the impact of the catabolism of the trimeric spike
on immunogenicity and vaccine efficacy is yet to be determined. The data presented here will
assist comparison across SARS-CoV-2 vaccination strategies and aid the development of nextgeneration immunogens.

Materials and Methods
Production of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19

expression in human cell lines and synthesised by GeneArt Gene Synthesis (Thermo Fisher
Scientific). The sequence encoding amino acids 2-1273 were cloned into a shuttle plasmid
following InFusion cloning (Clontech). The shuttle plasmid encodes a modified human
cytomegalovirus major immediate early promoter (IE CMV) with tetracycline operator (TetO)
sites, poly adenylation signal from bovine growth hormone (BGH) and a tPA signal sequence
upstream of the inserted gene.
Production of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 derived SARS-CoV-2 S
A litre of human embryonic kidney 293 Freestyle (HEK293F) cells, at 1×106 cells/ml density,
were infected with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 at an MOI of ~1 viral particles per cell. The cells were
incubated at 37 °C for 48 hours and pelleted in a centrifuge. The pellets were washed twice
with phosphate buffered saline before addition of 5 ml lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8),
150 mM NaCl 0.5% IGEPAL, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate,
1mM EDTA) and sonication. The mixture was centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 30 mins and the
supernatant was collected. 5 ml of lysis buffer and 3.5 ml of chloroform were added, and the
tube was vortexed. 9 ml H2O was added and after vortexing, the tube was centrifuged at 4,000
rpm for 30 mins. The upper liquid layer was removed, and 9 ml of methanol was added and
after vortexing, the tube was centrifuged again. The methanol was subsequently removed, and
the pellet was allowed to air dry in the dark. Pellets were dissolved in 50 mM sodium phosphate,
300 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.
Expression and purification of recombinant 2P-stabilised SARS-CoV-2 S
Recombinant 2P-stabilised SARS-CoV-2 S protein was expressed as previously described (3,
5). In brief, the expression vector containing the 2P-stabilised S protein was used to transiently
transfect FreeStyle293F cells. The protein was purified from the supernatant using nickelaffinity chromatography before size-exclusion chromatography.
Western blot analysis
Protein pellets from the HEK293F cell lysates were loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel, then
transferred to a PVDF membrane. Polyclonal rabbit anti-S1 antibody (Sinobiological, Cat:
40592-T62) and anti-S2 antibody (Abcam, Cat: ab272504) were used as primary antibodies.

Hela S3 cells at 4 ×105 cell/ml were infected with 10 MOI ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and incubated
at 37°C for 40-48h. Cells were harvested and pelleted by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min.
Resuspended cells were split into three pools for the alternative staining and were incubated
with either pooled prime-boost sera derived from outbred CD1 mice immunised
intramuscularly with 108 infectious units of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (18), prepared at 1:50 in PBSBSA-0.5% or human mAbs prepared at 1 μg/ml or recombinant ACE2 expressed with a human
Fc tag prepared at 2 μg/ml (see below). Cells were incubated for 2h at RT. Cells were washed
3 × with PBS-BSA-0.5% then incubated for 1h at RT with secondary antibodies conjugated
with Alexafluor488 diluted at 1:1000 in PBS-BSA 0.5% (for ChAdOx1 nCov-19 serum
staining Goat Anti mouse AlexaFluor 488 (Life Tech A11029), for ACE2 staining, Goat Anti
Human AlexaFluor 488 (Life Tech)). Cells were washed 2 × with PBS-BSA-0.5% before
resuspending in PBS and analysing by flow cytometry using a Fortessa X20 FACS analyser.
Samples were considered positive for spike expression if they had a fluorescence intensity
above a threshold value determined by the maximum intensity of the non-infected control cells

was included as well as a C-terminal four amino acid C-tag (EPEA) for affinity purification.
ACE2 ectodomain was transiently expressed in Expi293™ (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and

IgM-, IgA-, IgD-, Spike+ cells were then single cell sorted into 96-well PCR plates containing
RNase inhibitor (N2611; Promega) and stored at −80 °C.
Genes encoding Ig VH, Ig Vκ and Vλ from positive wells were amplified by RT-PCR (210210;
QIAGEN) and nested PCR (203205; Qiagen) using 'cocktails' of primers specific for human
IgG. PCR products of genes encoding heavy and light chains were joined with the expression
vector for human IgG1 or Ig κ-chain or λ-chain (gifts from H. Wardemann) by Gibson assembly.
Plasmids encoding heavy and light chains were then co-transfected into the 293T cell line by
the polyethylenimine method (408727; Sigma), and antibody were harvested for further study.

CryoET sample preparation and imaging
EM grids (G300F1, R2/2 Quantifoil holey carbon, gold) were glow-discharged and treated with
bovine fibronectin (20 μg/ml) for 30 minutes. Grids were washed with PBS and UV-treated for
1h. 1.6×105 of U2OS or HeLa cells resuspended in 2 ml of DMEM 10% FBS, Pen/Strep were
seeded on top of the grids in, in 6 well plate wells. Cells and grids were incubated for 24h at
37°C /5% CO2 to allow cell attachment to grid carbon. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 was added to the
cells at MOI 1 and cells were returned to 37°C/5% CO2 for 48h. Grids were plunge-frozen in
liquid ethane at -183°C using the Leica GP2 plunger, after receiving 1 μl of 5× concentrated
10 nm Au fiducial solution (EMS) in the back-side and being blotted from the back. Grids were
stored at liquid nitrogen until time of imaging.
Tilt series acquisition was carried out at a FEI Titan Krios G2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
electron microscope operated at 300 kV and equipped with a Gatan BioQuantum energy filter
and post-GIF K3 detector (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA) housed at electron Bioimaging Center
(eBIC/Diamond Light Source, UK). Tilt series were acquired using SerialEM (44) at a pixel
size of 2.13 Å. Zero-loss imaging was used for all tilt series with a 20 eV slit width. Defocus
values ranged from -2 µm to -7 µm.
A grouped dose-symmetric scheme was used for all tilt-series (45); with a range of +/-60
degrees at 3 degree increments in groups of 3 and total dose of 120-135 e-/Å2. At each tilt, 5
movie frames were recorded using Correlated Double Sampling (CDS) in super-resolution
mode and saved in lzw compressed tif format with no gain normalisation. Movies were
subsequently gain normalised during motion correction and Fourier cropped back to physical
pixel size with MotionCor2 (46).

Tilt-series were manually aligned using eTomo (47) and tilt-series and alignment files were
imported to emClarity (25). 11391 subtomograms were selected after template matching using
EMDB-21452 (4) as template, low-pass filtered to 40 Å. Subtomograms were separated in 2
completely independent half-datasets and iteratively
aligned and averaged resulting in a final 11.6 Å map at 0.5 FSC threshold. Model fitting and
visualization were performed in Chimera (48).
Glycopeptide analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
Approximately 90 gel bands containing the furin cleaved (S1/S2) and uncleaved (S0) SARSCoV-2 S protein were excised in order to gather sufficient material. The gel bands were destained in 50% 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 50% acetonitrile overnight. In-gel reduction
and alkylation were performed according to the protocol by Shevchenko et al. (49). The
proteins were digested using trypsin, chymotrypsin and alpha-lytic protease, which cleave at
the amino acids R/K, F/Y/W, and T/A/S/V, respectively. After extraction, the
peptide/glycopeptides were first treated with endoglycosidase H to deplete oligomannose-type
glycans and leave a single GlcNAc residue at the corresponding site. Subsequently, the reaction
mixture was completely dried and resuspended in a mixture containing PNGase F using only
H2O18 (Sigma-Aldrich) throughout. This reaction cleaves the remaining complex-type glycans
but leaves the GlcNAc residues remaining after Endo H digestion intact. The use of H2O18
enables complex-type glycan sites to be differentiated from unoccupied glycan sites since the
hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond by PNGase F leaves an O18 isotope on the resulting aspartic
acid residue. The resulting peptides are purified using C18 Zip-tip (MerckMillipore) clean-up
following the manufacturer’s protocol. Eluted glycopeptides were dried and re-suspended in
0.1% formic acid prior to analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. An Easy-nLC
1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) system coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) using higher energy collision-induced dissociation fragmentation
was used. Peptides were separated using an EasySpray PepMap RSLC C18 column (75 cm ×
75 μm) with a 275-minute linear gradient consisting of 0-32% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid
over 240 minutes, followed by 35 minutes of 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. The flow
rate was set to 200 nl/min. The spray voltage was set to 2.7 kV and the temperature of the
heated capillary was set to 40 °C. The ion transfer tube temperature was set to 275 °C. The
scan range was 400-1600 m/z. The HCD collision energy was set to 27%. Precursor and

fragment detection were performed at a resolution of MS1=100,000 and MS2=30,000. The
AGC target for MS1=4e5 and MS2=5e4 and injection time for MS1= 50 ms and MS2= 54 ms.
Glycopeptide fragmentation data were extracted from the raw file using ByonicTM (Version
3.5) and ByologicTM software (Version 3.5; Protein Metrics Inc.). The glycopeptide
fragmentation data were evaluated manually for each glycopeptide; the peptide was scored as
true-positive when the correct b- and y-fragment ions were observed. Two modifications were
searched for: +203 Da corresponding to a single GlcNAc residue, still attached to an asparagine
residue of an N-linked glycan site, following the cleavage by Endo H, and +3 D corresponding
to the O18 deamidation product of a complex glycan. The relative quantities of each glycan type
at each site as well as the unoccupied proportion were determined by comparison of the
extracted ion chromatographic areas.
Glycosylated model construction
Structural models of N-linked glycan presentation on SARS-CoV-2 S were created using
electron microscopy structures (PDB ID:6VSB) along with complex-, hybrid-, an
oligomannose-type N-linked glycans (PDB ID 4BYH, 4B7I, and 2WAH). A representative
glycoform presented at each site was modelled on to the N-linked carbohydrate attachment
sites in Coot (50).
