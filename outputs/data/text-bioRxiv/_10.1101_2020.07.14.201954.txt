The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected millions of people worldwide. The
characterization of the immunological mechanisms involved in disease symptomatology and
protective response is important to advance in disease control and prevention. Humans evolved
by losing the capacity to synthesize the glycan Galα1-3Galβ1-(3)4GlcNAc-R (α-Gal), which
resulted in the development of a protective response against pathogenic viruses and other
microorganisms containing this modification on membrane proteins mediated by anti-α-Gal
IgM/IgG antibodies produced in response to bacterial microbiota. In addition to anti-α-Gal
antibody-mediated pathogen opsonization, this glycan induces various immune mechanisms
that have shown protection in animal models against infectious diseases without inflammatory
responses. In this study, we hypothesized that the immune response to α-Gal may contribute to
the control of COVID-19. To address this hypothesis, we characterized the antibody response
to α-Gal in patients at different stages of COVID-19 and in comparison with healthy control
individuals. The results showed that while the inflammatory response and the anti-SARS-CoV2 (Spike) IgG antibody titers increased, reduction in anti-α-Gal IgE, IgM and IgG antibody
titers and alteration of anti-α-Gal antibody isotype composition correlated with COVID-19
severity. The results suggested that the inhibition of the α-Gal-induced immune response may
translate into more aggressive viremia and severe disease inflammatory symptoms. These
results support the proposal of developing interventions such as probiotics based on commensal

The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), a pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly evolved from an epidemic outbreak to a
disease affecting the global population. SARS-CoV-2 infects human host cells by binding to
the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor [1]. It has been established that COVID19 mainly affects the respiratory tract, but as a systemic disease it affects multiple processes
including the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, neurological, hematopoietic and immune
systems2. Several days after the onset of symptoms, the SARS-CoV-2 infection becomes more
systemic and affecting various organs with inflammatory responses and lymphocytopenia [2].
Lymphocytopenia is likely caused by the direct lethal effect of SARS-CoV-2 on lymphocytes
with the ACE2 receptor [3] and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor
necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin 1 (IL-1) and IL-6 that induce apoptosis in
lymphocytes [4]. The “cytokine storm syndrome (CSS)” has been associated with COVID-19
through the activation of the nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) innate immune pathway resulting in
the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines [5]. The lymphocytopenia in patients with
COVID-19 along with the rise in neutrophils have been associated with a worse disease
prognosis. Consequently, patients with respiratory distress syndrome in intensive care units
(ICU) show lower lymphocyte counts and higher mortality when compared to other COVID19 patients [6,7]. Additionally, COVID-19 patients suffer dysbacteriosis in the gut and lung
microbiota due to enrichment of opportunistic pathogens and depletion of beneficial
commensals, which suggested the development of interventions such as probiotics to reduce
the severity of COVID-19 through modification of the microbiota composition [1,8,9].
Humans evolved by losing the capacity to synthesize the glycan Galα1-3Galβ1-(3)4GlcNAcR (α-Gal), which resulted in the development of a protective response of anti-α-Gal IgM/IgG
antibodies against pathogenic viruses (e.g HIV), bacteria (e.g. Mycobacterium) and parasites
(e.g. Plasmodium) containing this modification on membrane proteins [10-14]. The natural
IgM/IgG antibodies against α-Gal are produced in response to bacteria with this modification
in the microbiota [10]. In addition to anti-α-Gal antibody-mediated pathogen opsonization, this
glycan induces various immune mechanisms such as B-cell maturation, macrophage response,
activation of the complement system, upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines through the
Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)/NF-kB innate immune pathway, and TLR-mediated induction of
anti-inflammatory nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signalling pathway [1416]. In conjunction, the immune response to α-Gal in animal models has shown protection
against infectious diseases without inflammatory responses [10,12-14,17].
Based on these results, we have hypothesized that the immune response to α-Gal may play a
role in the person-to-person variability in COVID-19 disease symptoms with putative
protective capacity [18]. First, if the virus contains α-Gal, it would be possible to limit the
zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by antibody-mediated opsonization [18]. Secondly,
boosting α-Gal-mediated protective immune and anti-inflammatory responses may contribute
to the control of COVID-19 while increasing protection to pathogens with α-Gal on their
surface that negatively affect the individual response to SARS-CoV-2 [14,18].
To address this hypothesis, herein we characterized the antibody response to α-Gal in patients
at different stages of COVID-19 and in comparison with healthy control individuals. The

results showed that while the inflammatory response and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Spike) IgG
antibody titers increased, reduction in anti-α-Gal antibody titers and alteration of anti-α-Gal
antibody isotype composition correlated with COVID-19 severity. These results suggested that
the inhibition of the α-Gal-induced immune response translates into more aggressive viremia
and severe disease symptoms.

2.1. COVID-19 patients and healthy control individuals
A retrospective case-control study was conducted in patients suffering from COVID-19
admitted to the University General Hospital of Ciudad Real (HGUCR), Spain from March 1 to
April 15, 2020. The infection by SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in all patients included in the
study by the real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay from
Abbott Laboratories (Abbott RealTime SARS-COV-2 assay, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA) from
upper respiratory tract samples after hospital admission. Clinical features, as well as laboratory
determinations were obtained from patient's medical records. The patients were grouped as (a)
hospital discharge (n = 27), (b) hospitalized (n = 29) and (c) intensive care unit (ICU; n = 25)
(Table 1). Patients were hospitalized for developing a moderate-severe clinical condition with
radiologically demonstrated pneumonia and failure in blood oxygen saturation. Patients with
acute respiratory failure who needed mechanical ventilation support were admitted to a hospital
ICU. The patients were discharged from the hospital due to the clinical and radiological
improvement of pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV-2, along with the normalization of
analytical parameters indicative of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), D-Dimer
and blood cell count (Table 1). Samples from asymptomatic COVID-19 cases with positive
anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody titers but negative by RT-PCR (n = 10) were collected in May
22-29, 2020 and included in the analysis. Samples from healthy control individuals (n = 37)
were collected prior to COVID-19 pandemic in April 2019. The use of samples and
individual’s data was approved by the Ethical and Scientific Committee (University Hospital
of Ciudad Real, C-352 and SESCAM C-73).

2.2. Serum and saliva samples
Serum samples were collected for confirmed COVID-19 patients and healthy control
individuals. Nursing personnel at the HGUCR extracted blood samples. Blood samples were
drawn in a vacutainer tube without anticoagulant. The tube remained at rest for 15-30 min at
room temperature (RT) for clotting. Subsequently, the tube was centrifuged at 1500 x g for 10
min at RT to remove the clot and obtain the serum sample. Serum samples were heatinactivated for 30 min at 56 ºC and conserved at -20 ºC until used for analysis [19]. Saliva
samples from asymptomatic COVID-19 cases were collected and stored at -20 ºC until used
for analysis.
2.3. Determination of antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2
Antibody titers specific for the recognition of virus infection based on IgG against SARS-CoV2 Spike (EI 2606-9601 G) and Nucleocapsid (EI 2606-9601-2 G) proteins and IgA (EI 26069601 A) were determined by ELISA (Euroimmun, Lubeck, Germany) following
manufacturer’s indications [19,20]. Briefly, 100 µl of the calibrator, positive and negative
controls and serum samples at 1:100 dilution was added to the 96-microwell plate coated with
SARS-CoV-2 proteins and incubated for 1 h at 37 ºC. After washing 3 times with 300 µl/well
of wash buffer, 100 µl/well of enzyme conjugate (peroxidase-labelled anti-human IgG or IgA)
were added and incubated for 30 min at RT. Then, after 3 washes with 300 µl/well of wash
buffer, 100 µl/well of chromogen substrate solution were added and incubated for 15 min (EI
2606-9601-2 G) or 30 min (EI 2606-9601 G; EI 2606-9601 A) at RT. Finally, the colorimetric
reaction was stopped with 100 µl/well of stop solution and the absorbance was measured in a
spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at O.D. of 450 nm. Results
were evaluated semiquantitative by calculating the ratio between O.D. of the sample and the
O.D of the calibrator, being those under 0.8 considered as negative and those over 1.1 as
positive.
2.4. Determination of antibody titers against α-Gal
High absorption capacity polystyrene microtiter plates were coated with 50 ng of BSA coated
with α-Gal (BSA-α-Gal, thereafter named α-Gal; Dextra, Shinfield, UK) per well in carbonatebicarbonate buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and used for ELISA. After an
overnight incubation at 4 °C, coated plates were washed one time with 100 µl/well PBS with
0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) (Sigma-Aldrich), blocked with 100 µl/well of 1% human serum
albumin (HAS) in PBST (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at RT and then washed 4 times with 100
µl/well of PBST. Human serum and saliva samples were diluted 1:100 and 1:2, respectively in
PBST with 1% HAS and 100 µl/well were added into the wells of the antigen-coated plates
and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed four times with PBST and 100 µl/well of
goat anti-human immunoglobulins-peroxidase IgG (FC specific; Sigma-Aldrich), IgM (µchain specific; Sigma-Aldrich), IgE (ɛ-chain specific; Sigma-Aldrich), and IgA (heavy chain
specific; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) secondary antibodies diluted 1:1000, v/v in blocking
solution were added and incubated for 1 h at RT. Plates were washed four times with 100
µl/well of PBST and 100 µl/well of 3,3,´5,5-tetramethylbenzidine TMB (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) were added and incubated for 20 min at RT. Finally, the reaction was stopped with
50 µl/well of 2 N H2SO4 and the O.D. was measured in a spectrophotometer at 450 nm. The
average of two technical replicates per sample was used for analysis after background (coated
wells incubated with PBS and secondary antibodies) subtraction. Reference values for serum

immunoglobulin levels [21] were considered in the analysis of the profile of anti-α-Gal
antibody isotypes.
2.5. Statistical analysis
The ELISA O.D. at 450 nm values were compared between different groups by one-way
ANOVA test (p = 0.05; https://www.socscistatistics.com/tests/anova/default2.aspx). Pairwise
comparisons between groups were conducted by Student’s t-test (p = 0.05). A Spearman Rho
(rs)
correlation
analysis
(p
=
0.05;
https://www.socscistatistics.com/tests/spearman/default2.aspx) was conducted between antiSARS-CoV-2 Spike IgG titers and COVID-19 disease severity (2 = asymptomatic, 3 = hospital
discharge, 4 = hospitalized, 5 = ICU), anti-α-Gal IgA, IgE, IgM and IgG antibody titers and
disease severity (1 = healthy, 2 = asymptomatic, 3 = hospital discharge, 4 = hospitalized, 5 =
ICU), and for anti-α-Gal IgA and IgG antibody titers between serum and saliva samples.

3. Results
3.1. Inflammatory biomarkers are associated with severity in COVID-19 patients
In the blood cell analysis, the ICU patients showed higher lymphocytopenia, percentage and
neutrophil counts when compared to hospital discharge and hospitalized individuals (p < 0.001;
Figure 1a and Table 1). The cellular and biochemical indicators of systemic inflammation,
Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Count Ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer levels
were higher in ICU patients when compared to other patients (p < 0.002; Figure 1a and Table
1). Although more severe symptoms have been associated with elderly patients, herein older
patients were recorded in the hospitalized and not the ICU group (p < 0.001; Table 1). The
healthy and asymptomatic individuals did not show symptoms of inflammation. These results
corroborated a higher inflammation rate in the most critical COVID-19 patients independently
of the age factor.
3.2. Immune response to SARS-CoV-2 increased with severity in COVID-19 patients
All COVID-19 symptomatic patients showed both IgA and IgG antibody titers against SARSCoV-2 (Figure 1b). In asymptomatic cases, only IgG antibody titers were determined, and all
tested positive (Figure 1b). However, only the IgG titers against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike
protein significantly increased in accordance with disease symptoms (p = 0.02; Figure 1b) with
a positive correlation (rs > 0; p = 0; Figure 1b). These results showed that COVID-19 patients
were immunocompetent despite the inflammatory response.

anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA, IgG (spike) and IgG (nucleocapsid) antibody levels were determined by ELISA. The
patients were grouped as asymptomatic (n = 10), hospital discharge (n = 27), hospitalized (n = 29) and ICU (n =

= asymptomatic, 3 = hospital discharge, 4 = hospitalized, 5 = ICU).

3.3. Immune response to α-Gal varied in COVID-19 patients
The serum IgA, IgE, IgM and IgG antibody response to α-Gal was characterized in healthy
individuals and COVID-19 patients at different disease stages (Figures 2 and 3a). A negative
correlation was observed for IgE, IgM and IgG between anti-α-Gal antibody titers and disease
severity (rs < 0; p = 0; Figure 3a). The anti-α-Gal IgA antibody titers did not vary between the
different groups (p = 0.21136; Fig. 3a) nor correlate with disease severity (rs = 0.02; p = 0.91;
Figure 3a). For anti-α-Gal IgM and IgG antibodies, the titers decreased from healthy to ICU
individuals (p < 0.00001; Figures 2 and 3a). However, in asymptomatic cases the anti-α-Gal
IgE titers were higher than in healthy individuals and symptomatic COVID-19 patients (p <
0.000001; Figure 3a). In COVID-19 patients, the IgE but not IgM and IgG antibody titers were
higher in hospitalized patients than in hospital discharge and ICU cases (p < 0.05; Figure 2).

that anti-α-Gal IgE and IgM antibodies are more abundant than reference values even in healthy
individuals. However, the most abundant anti-α-Gal antibodies varied from IgM/IgG in healthy
individuals to IgE (asymptomatic), IgG (hospital discharge), none (hospitalized) and IgA (ICU)
in COVID-19 cases (Figure 3b).

Figure 3: Serum anti-α-Gal antibody response in COVID-19 asymptomatic and symptomatic cases and healthy
controls. (a) The IgA, IgE, IgM and IgG anti-α-Gal antibody titers were determined by ELISA. Individuals were
grouped as healthy controls (n = 37), asymptomatic (n = 10), hospital discharge (n = 27), hospitalized (n = 29)
and ICU (n = 25). The results were compared between different groups by one-way ANOVA test (p < 0.05). A
Spearman Rho (rs) correlation analysis (p < 0.05) was conducted between anti-α-Gal IgA, IgE, IgM and IgG
antibody titers and disease severity (1 = healthy, 2 = asymptomatic, 3 = hospital discharge, 4 = hospitalized, 5 =
ICU). (b) Profile of anti-α-Gal antibody isotype (shown as percentage of antibody titers) for each group.
Reference values for serum immunoglobulin levels were included. Antibody isotypes with highest
representation on each group are highlighted in red.

Despite differences in absolute values due to dilutions of the samples used for ELISA (1:100
for serum vs. 1:2 for saliva), as expected, anti-α-Gal IgA but not IgG antibody titers were higher
in saliva than in serum samples (p = 0.0002; Figure 4a) but without a significant correlation (p
> 0.05). The saliva anti-α-Gal IgA antibody titers were similar between asymptomatic COVID19 cases and healthy individuals (p = 0.3049; Figure 4b).

4. Discussion
Systemic inflammation is associated with changes in quantity and composition of circulating
blood cells and has been identified as the primary basic mechanism resulting in disability and
increased mortality in COVID-19 [22]. As previously reported [23,24], in the blood cell
analysis of cellular and biochemical indicators of systemic inflammation, the ICU patients
showed higher lymphocytopenia independently of the age factor associated with more severe
COVID-19 symptoms [25].
The results of our study showed a negative correlation between anti-α-Gal antibody titers and
COVID-19 disease severity. However, these results raised the question of whether the observed
reduction in the anti-α-Gal antibody response at the population level is a consequence or a
cause of COVID-19 symptomatology. Considering that COVID-19 patients were
immunocompetent with a positive correlation between anti-SARS-CoV-2 Spike antibody titers
and disease severity [26], our results suggested that the decrease in the anti-α-Gal antibody
response occurred by mechanisms different from humoral immunosuppression and as a
consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In addition to the observed negative correlation between anti-α-Gal IgE, IgM and IgG antibody
titers and COVID-19 disease severity, our results showed differences in the profile of anti-α-

Gal antibody isotypes in COVID-19 cases that may be associated with different disease stages
(Figure 5). These results suggested that higher anti-α-Gal IgE levels in asymptomatic cases
may reflect an allergic response mediated by this glycan, which reflects the trade-off associated
with the immune response to α-Gal that benefit humans by providing immunity to pathogen
infection while increasing the risk of developing allergic reactions to this molecule [12,13,17].
In healthy individuals as in hospital discharge cases, the higher representation of anti-α-Gal
IgM and/or IgG antibodies may be associated with a protective response to COVID-19.
However, in hospitalized patients the representation of anti-α-Gal antibody isotypes did not
vary, which could reflect the absence of protection. Finally, the higher representation of antiα-Gal IgA antibodies in ICU patients may be associated with the inflammatory response
observed in these cases. In accordance with these results, it was recently shown in endogenous
α-Gal-negative turkeys that treatment with probiotic bacteria with high α-Gal content results
in protection against aspergillosis through reduction by still unknown mechanisms in the proinflammatory anti-α-Gal IgA response in the lungs [27].

Figure 5: Proposed functional correlation between the anti-α-Gal antibody response and COVID-19. A negative
correlation between anti-α-Gal antibody titers and COVID-19 disease severity and differences in the profile of
anti-α-Gal antibody isotypes may be associated with different disease stages. Our hypothesis is that the
dysbacteriosis observed in COVID-19 patients translates into a reduction in total anti-α-Gal antibody titers and
alteration of anti-α-Gal antibody isotype composition due to the reduction in the microbiota of α-Gal-containing
commensal bacteria.

Based on the fact that natural antibodies against α-Gal are produced in response to bacteria
with this modification in the microbiota [10], our hypothesis is that the dysbacteriosis observed
in COVID-19 patients [28] translates into a reduction in total anti-α-Gal antibody titers and
alteration of anti-α-Gal antibody isotype composition due to the reduction in the microbiota of
α-Gal-containing commensal bacteria and other still uncharacterized mechanisms (Figure 5).

Alternatively, individuals with higher α-Gal content in the microbiota may be less susceptible
to COVID-19. Additionally, the pulmonary microbiota can be affected with the presence of
gut bacteria in the lungs [9].

The protective response of anti-α-Gal IgM/IgG antibodies against pathogenic organisms
containing this modification on membrane proteins has been well documented [10-14,17,29].
In contrast, IgE antibody response against α-Gal has been associated with the allergy to
mammalian meat or alpha-Gal syndrome and other diseases such as atopy, coronary artery
disease and atherosclerosis [30-33].
In preliminary analyses, it was suggested that blood type O individuals are less susceptible to
COVID-19 than other blood type groups [34,35], a finding that was recently confirmed by
genetic analyses [36]. ABO blood groups contain highly fucosylated antigens [37,38], a
property shared with the glycans present in SARS-CoV-239. For example, glycosylation in
Spike asparagine (N343) is highly fucosylated with 98% of detected glycans bearing fucose
residues [39]. Accordingly, the monoclonal antibody S309 that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 binds
core fucose moieties in N343 and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), a structural glycan found in
both SARS-CoV-2 [39] and ABO blood groups [37,38]. These findings prompted us to
consider that blood type O individuals could produce antibodies against A and B antigens that
in addition to IgM/IgG antibodies against α-Gal, which cross-react with the structurally similar
blood B antigen [40], could be involved in a polyvalent recognition of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike
that may be implicated in the human protection to COVID-19.
In conclusion, according to these results and previous findings in retrovirus [41,42], the
inhibition of the α-Gal-induced immune response may translate into more aggressive viremia
and severe disease inflammatory symptoms [43]. These results further encourage addressing
the proposal of developing interventions such as probiotics based on commensal bacteria with
α-Gal epitopes to modify the microbiota and increase the α-Gal-induced protective immune
response and reduce the severity of COVID-19 [8,18].
