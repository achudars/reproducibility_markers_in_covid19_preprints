Abstract

30

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic urges for cheap, reliable and rapid technologies for disinfection

31

and decontamination. We here evaluated the efficiency of UV-C irradiation to inactivate

32

surface dried SARS-CoV-2. Drying for two hours did not have a major impact on the infectivity

33

of SARS-CoV-2, indicating that exhaled virus in droplets or aerosols stays infectious on

34

surfaces at least for a certain amount of time. Strikingly, short exposure of high titer surface

35

dried virus (3*10^6 IU/ml) with UV-C light (16 mJ/cm²) resulted in a total reduction of SARS-

36

CoV-2 infectivity. Together, our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly inactivated

37

by relatively low doses of UV-C irradiation. Hence, UV-C treatment is an effective non-

38

chemical possibility to decontaminate surfaces from high-titer infectious SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

58

SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally and there is an urgent need for rapid, highly efficient,

59

environmentally friendly, and non-chemical disinfection procedures. Application of UV-C light

60

is an established technology for decontamination of surfaces and aerosols (1-3). This

61

procedure has proven effective to inactivate SARS-CoV-1 (4-6), several other enveloped and

62

non-enveloped viruses as well as bacteria (7). Recently, it has also been shown that SARS-

63

CoV-2 is sensitive to inactivation by UV-C irradiation (8-10). However, doses and exposure

64

times necessary for total inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 were in a range precluding efficient

65

application of UV-based methods to be employed for large-scale decontamination of surfaces

66

and aerosols (10). We hence conducted a “real-life” application approach simulating the

67

inactivation of dried surface residing infectious SARS-CoV-2 by a mobile handheld UV-C

68

emitting device and an UV-C box designed to decontaminate medium-size objects. Our data

69

shows that surface dried SARS-CoV-2 retains infectivity for at least two hours. Short

70

exposure of high-titer surface dried SARS-CoV-2 to UV-C light lead to a total reduction of

71

infectivity. Hence, UV-C irradiation is a rapid and cost-effective technology to decontaminate

72

surfaces from high-titer SARS-CoV-2.

Material and Methods

77

Cell culture. Caco-2 (Human Colorectal adenocarcinoma) cells were cultured at 37 °C with

78

5% CO2 in DMEM containing 10% FCS, with 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin-

79

streptomycin and 1% NEAA.

80

Viruses. The recombinant SCoV2 expressing mNeonGreen (icSARS-CoV-2-mNG) (11) was

81

obtained from the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA)

82

at the UTMB (University of Texas Medical Branch). To generate icSARS-CoV-2-mNG stocks,

83

200,000 Caco-2 cells were infected with 50 μl of virus stock in a 6-well plate, the supernatant

84

was harvested 48 hpi, centrifuged, and stored at -80°C.

85

For MOI determination, a titration using serial dilutions of the virus stock was conducted. The

86

number of infectious virus particles per ml was calculated as the (MOI × cell

87

number)/(infection volume), where MOI = −ln(1 − infection rate).

88

UV-C light inactivation treatment. 35 uL of virus stock, corresponding to ~4*106 infectious

89

units (IU) of icSARS-CoV-2-mNG were spotted (in triplicates) in 6-well plates and dried for

90

two hours at RT. 6-well plates spotted with dried virus were treated with UV-C-light using the

91

Soluva® pro UV Disinfection Chamber (Heraeus) for 60 seconds or the Soluva® pro UV

92

Disinfection Handheld (Heraeus) for 2 seconds in a fix regime at 5 and 20 cm plate distance.

93

In addition, a moving regime using a slow (3.75 cm/s) and fast (12 cm/s) speed at 20 cm

94

distance was tested. As control, 6-well plates were spotted with the virus and dried, but not

95

UV-treated. After UV-treatment, the spotted virus was reconstituted using 1 mL of infection

96

media (culture media with 5% FCS). As control, 35 uL of the original virus stock were diluted

97

to 1 ml with infection media and used as virus stock infection control.

98

Evaluation of UV-treatment. For infection experiments, 1 ×104 Caco-2 cells/well were

99

seeded in 96-well plates the day before infection. Cells were incubated with the SARS-CoV-2

100

strain icSARS-CoV-2-mNG at a MOI=1.1 (stock) or the UV-treated and reconstituted virus in

101

serial two-fold dilutions from 1:200 up to 1:51200. 48 hpi cells were fixed with 2% PFA and

102

stained with Hoechst33342 (1 µg/mL final concentration) for 10 minutes at 37°C. The staining

103

solution was removed and exchanged for PBS. For quantification of infection rates, images

104

were taken with the Cytation3 (Biotek) and Hoechst+ and mNG+ cells were automatically

105

counted by the Gen5 Software (Biotek).

106

Viral titers (number of infectious virus particles per ml) were calculated as the (MOI × cell

107

number)/(infection volume), where MOI = −ln(1 − infection rate). Infection rates lower than

108

0.01 were used as a cutoff and set to 0 in order to avoid false positive calculations.

109

Software and statistical analysis. GraphPad Prism 8.0 was used for statistical analyses

110

and to generate graphs. Figures were generated with CorelDrawX7. Other software used

111

included Gen5 v.3.10.

Results

114

We set up an experimental approach to evaluate the effect of UV-C treatment on the stability

115

of SARS-CoV-2. Simulating the situation that exhaled droplets or aerosols from infected

116

individuals contaminate surfaces, we produced a high-titer SARS-CoV-2 infectious stock and

117

dried 35µL of this stock corresponding to ~4*10^6 IU/ml in each well of a 6-well plate. The

118

plates were then either non-treated or exposed to five UV-C regimens (Fig. 1a). These

119

include inactivation for 60 s in a box designed to disinfect medium-size objects, 2 s exposure

120

at 5 cm or 20 cm distance with a handheld UV-C disinfection device and finally an approach

121

simulating decontamination of surfaces via the handheld UV-C device. For this, we performed

122

slow and fast-moving at a distance of ~20 cm, with “slow” corresponding to a speed of ~3.75

123

cm/s (supplemental movie 1) and “fast” at ~12 cm/s (supplemental movie 2). UV-C irradiance

124

(254 nm) in the box with an exposure time of 60 seconds corresponds to an irradiation dose

125

of 800 mJ/cm²; for the handheld (HH) at 5 cm the UV-C dose at two second irradiation time is

126

80 mJ/cm² and at 20 cm is 16 mJ/cm². From the speed of the “slow” and “fast” moving

127

regimens we calculate a UV-C dose of 2.13 mJ/cm² (slow) and 0.66 mJ/cm² (fast), assuming

128

a focused intensity beam. However, taking into consideration the UV-C light distribution

129

underneath the handheld device the integrated UV-C dose accumulates to 20 mJ/cm² for the

130

fast regimen.

131

Subsequently, dried virus was reconstituted with 1 mL infection media and used to inoculate

132

naïve Caco-2 cells at serial dilutions to calculate viral titers. Taking advantage of an infectious

133

SARS-CoV-2 strain expressing the chromophore mNeonGreen (11), we quantified infected

134

(mNG+) and total (Hoechst+) cells by single-cell counting with an imaging multiplate reader.

135

Of note, even short UV-C treatment of the dried virus in the context of the moving “fast”

136

regimen completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2, as no infected cells were detected based on

137

fluorescence protein expression (Fig. 1b). Titration of two-fold series dilutions of the UV-

138

treated and non-treated control samples, as well as the freshly thawed strain as reference,

139

revealed that (i) drying for two hours does not have a major impact on the infectivity of SARS-

140

CoV-2 and (ii) all five UV-C treatment regimens effectively inactivate SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1c).

141

Calculation of viral titers based on the titration of the reconstituted virus stocks revealed a

142

loss of titer due to drying from ~4*10^6 to ~3*10^6 IU/ml and effective 6-log titer reduction of

143

SARS-CoV-2 by all employed UV-C treatment regimens (Fig. 1d). Altogether, our data

144

demonstrate that UV-C regimens that expose high-titer SARS-CoV-2 to doses down to 16

145

mJ/cm² are sufficient to achieve complete inactivation of the virus.

146
147

Discussion

148

Disinfection of surfaces and aerosols by UV-C irradiation is an established, safe and non-

149

chemical procedure used for the environmental control of pathogens (1-3, 12). UV-C

150

treatment has proven effective against several viruses including SARS-CoV-1 (4-6) and other

151

coronaviruses i.e. Canine coronaviruses (13). Hence, as recently demonstrated by others (8-

152

10) and now confirmed by our study it was expected that SARS-CoV-2 is permissive for

153

inactivation by UV-C treatment. One critical question is the suitability of this technology in a

154

“real-life” setting in which the exposure time of surfaces or aerosols should be kept as short

155

as possible to allow for a realistic application, for example in rooms that need to be used

156

frequently as operating rooms or lecture halls. Furthermore, in such a setting, we assume that

157

the virus is exhaled from an infected person by droplets and aerosols, dries on surfaces and

158

hence represents a threat to non-infected individuals. We simulated such a situation and first

159

evaluated if surface dried SARS-CoV-2 is infectious. Drying for two hours, in agreement with

160

previous work (14), did not result in a significant reduction of viral infectivity indicating smear-

161

infections could indeed play a role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1). On the other

162

hand, our virus-preparations are dried in cell culture pH-buffered medium containing FCS,

163

which might stabilize viral particles. Hence, even though this is not the scope of the current

164

study, it will be interesting to evaluate if longer drying or virus-preparations in PBS affect the

165

environmental stability of SARS-CoV-2. Irrespective of the latter, UV-C-exposure of dried

166

high-titer SARS-CoV-2 preparations containing ~3*10^6 IU/ml resulted in a complete

167

reduction of viral infectivity (Fig. 1). In this context, it is noteworthy that we achieved a 6-log

168

virus-titer reduction in a setting simulating surface disinfection with a moving handheld device.

169

With the “fast”-moving protocol (see supplemental video 1) we were exposing surfaces at a

170

distance of 20 cm with a speed of 12.5 cm/s resulting in an calculated integrated UV-C dose

171

of 20 mJ/cm² at 254 nm. This is substantially less than the previously reported 1048 mJ/cm²

172

necessary to achieve a 6-log reduction in virus titers when exposing aqueous SARS-CoV-2 to

173

UV-C (10). In another study, using a 222 nm UV-LED source, 3 mJ/cm² lead to a 2.51-log

174

(99.7 %) reduction of infectious SARS-CoV-2 when irradiating for 30 s, however inactivation

175

did not be increase with extended irradiation regimens up to 300 s (9). In addition, 20 s deep-

176

ultraviolet treatment at 280 nm corresponding to a dose of 75 mJ/cm² reduced SARS-CoV-2

177

titer up to 3-logs (8). Comparing these values to other pathogens, SARS-CoV-2 seems

178

particularly sensitive towards UV-C light. To achieve a 3-log titer reduction, 75-130 mJ/cm²

179

are necessary for adenovirus, 11-28 mJ/cm² for poliovirus, and bacteria as for instance

180

Bacillus subtilis require 18-61 mJ/cm² (7). This is in-line with susceptibility of SARS-CoV

181

towards UV-C in aerosols at 2.6 mJ/cm², whereas adenovirus or MS2-bacteriophages were

182

resistant to such a treatment (1).

183

Altogether, we establish the effectiveness of UV-C treatment against SARS-CoV-2 in a

184

setting designed to simulate realistic conditions of decontamination. The easy, rapid,

185

chemical-free, and high efficacy of UV-C treatment to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates

186

the applicability of this technology in a broad range of possible settings.
