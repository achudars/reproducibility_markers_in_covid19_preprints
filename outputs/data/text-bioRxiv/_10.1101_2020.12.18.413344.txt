Progressing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to humans

Abstract
The second and subsequent waves of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have caused problems
worldwide 1. Here, using an objective analytical method 2, we present the changes that occurred in
the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus of
COVID-19, over time. The virus has mutated in three major directions, resulting in three groups to
date. Analysis of the basic structure of the group of viruses was completed by April and shared
across all continents. However, the virus continued to mutate independently in each country after
the borders were closed. In particular, the virus mutated before the occurrence of the second and
subsequent peaks. It seems that the mutations conferred higher infectivity to the virus, because of
which the virus overcame previously effective protection and caused second waves of the disease.
Currently, each country may possess such a unique, stronger variant. Some of them slowly entered
other countries and caused epidemics. These viruses could also serve as sources of further
mutations by exchanging parts of the genome, which could create variants with superior infectivity.

Introduction
The evolutionary trajectory of an evolved virus is difficult to analyse from nucleotide sequences

because the data have complex multivariate structures with numerous dimensions 2. Phylogenetic
trees have long been used to present relationships in among sequences 3 and many studies on severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 4 have employed them 5-8, but they have
two drawbacks. One is the decisive lack of falsifiability that ruins objectivity 9, and the other is a
lack of generality that makes it difficult to integrate with other data sources.
Here, an analysis was performed using a more objective method, i.e., principal component analysis
(PCA) 10. PCA runs a singular value decomposition on a sequence described as a Boolean vector
and obtains the principal component (PC) for the sample and base in parallel 11. PCA finds common
directions among a dataset and represents them as independent axes. These axes have an order; PC1
is common to most data, and the lower the contribution to differences in the data, the lower the
order. The sample or base is presented on the axis according to its characteristics. As shown in the
current study, SARS-CoV-2 data were represented by two axes as a whole. The lower axes
represented mutations found in smaller areas. The components were scaled and compared with
those of the influenza virus 12 as needed. In addition, the results were integrated with the date and
location of collection.

Results and Discussion
Overview of PCA. PCs 1 and 2 formed a triangle comprising four groups that were temporarily
termed as 0-3 (Fig. 1A). All groups were found on all continents. In contrast to PC1 and PC2
showing the overall situation, the PC3 axis and the lower-order axes showed differences that relate
to only a small number of the samples (Fig. 1B and Extended Data Fig. 1), with smaller
contributions to differences in the data (Extended Data Fig. 2); many of them were detected in
limited countries after April (comparing Extended Data Fig. 1 and 3). Such mutations occurred

since April when countries began to restrict the movement of people across national borders. The
overview of Fig. 1A was completed at the end of March (Fig. 1C). Although group 3 once appeared
worldwide, it has been contained to date (Fig. 1D).
These features were similar for both RNA and protein (Extended Data Fig. 1 and 4). The rate of
missense mutations, which affects amino acid sequence, was 63% (Extended Data Fig. 5). This is a
fairly high rate; rather, null mutations are expected to be 61% 13 even though some differences
caused by ignoring damaging mutations have been identified here. In fact, in the case of H1N1
influenza virus from 2001 to 2003 in the United States, the rate was 22%. This suggested that
SARS-CoV-2 was under selective pressure to alter its protein structure.

presented. The components are scaled by the length of sequences; squares of the values are
correlated with the expectation of differences per base (Supplementary Information).

The viral groups causing the epidemics changed over time (Fig. 2A). The second and third waves in
each country were caused by new variants of the virus, which showed different patterns at lower
PCs (Fig. 2). In England, the second wave was caused by a variant of the Group 0, which has since
spread to many countries in Europe (Extended Data Fig. 6, panels A-I). The third wave occurred
due to another variant of Group 1, H69-V70 (Fig. 2C) 14,15.
The H69-V70 variant in the UK 14,15 actually involves multiple mutations (Extended Data Table 2).
The deletion itself has occurred spontaneously in multiple groups (Fig. 2D); the epidemic in the UK
is caused by a group 1 variant, while those in Germany and Denmark are caused by group 0. There
were other group 1 variants without the deletion in the UK, which would be the ancestral variants.
The group 1 H69-V70 variant in the UK is growing at the same or faster rate than the pan-European
variant by replacing it (Fig. 2A). These results show that this variant could be more infectious than
the pan-European variant.
A group 2 variant is quickly spreading in South Africa (Extended Data Fig. 6Q and 6R). As it had
not appeared until October, the axes of PCA had not trained for the variant; hence, the figure was
made by renewing the axes. This is a novel variant that contains many mutations concentrated in
the spike protein, and the magnitude of mutation is deemed comparable to that of influenza H1N1
hemagglutinin between sequential peaks (Table 1). Group 2 variants have been negligible in South
Africa (Extended Data Fig. 6Q), and no variant was considered ancestral. Perhaps the epidemic
variant was from areas where samples are rarely sequenced. Any region in the world can produce a
new highly infectious variant, with potential to cross national borders. Therefore, measures such as

vaccines are urgently needed on a global scale.
In many countries, mutations were detected several weeks prior to the peaks (Fig. 2 and Extended
Data Fig. 6). This suggested that the mutations were the cause of the peak. In any case, the variants
prevalent at those peaks should certainly be more infectious than they were before the mutation, so
the variants were replaced. The higher infectivity may have weakened the previously effective
protections from the virus. Altered residues between the peaks are shown in Extended Data Table 1;
because PCA showed differences among samples and bases in parallel, PCs for bases may help
identify those differences. It may be possible to predict the next wave by monitoring the mutations.
However, only a limited number of countries continue sequencing the virus; many have reported
only the first peak. However, the second and subsequent peaks are caused by different variants (Fig.
2 and Extended Data Fig. 6).

Magnitude of mutations. Influenza H1N1 is highly infectious in humans 16. It mutates continuously
but does not appear in the same area during two sequential years. It is prevalent every few years
because it takes time to mutate enough to survive against herd immunity in the area. However, the
magnitude of changes in the meantime varies (Table 1). Perhaps, the part of the sequence that needs
to be modified to escape herd immunity varies from case to case. However, the changes in
coronavirus before and after the peaks were much smaller (Table 1). The differences seem to be
smaller than that needed to obtain another peak of seasonal influenza, although this does not
guarantee safety from exceptional reinfections 17,18. A possible exception is the one that presently
causes an epidemic in South Africa.
A case of pdm09 influenza virus that likely corresponded to SARS-CoV-2 mutations was observed
in Thailand from 2009 to 2010 (Extended Data Fig. 7) 19. The 2009 pandemic was subdued in this
tropical country, and three peaks were subsequently identified toward 2010. At the second peak,
only the nucleotide sequence changed, and at the third peak, the hemagglutinin protein changed
(Table 1) with a high rate of missense mutations (54%). However, these changes were not highly
associated with herd immunity because most of the population was not yet infected. These changes
might be caused by the adaptation of pdm09—originally a swine strain—to humans.

The influenza virus genome continues to mutate and not only in the part that is directly associated
with infection 12. This property may be the reason it has repeatedly deceived herd immunity for
decades, allowing influenza to remain as a pandemic.
In contrast, mutations in SARS-CoV-2 were not uniform; rather, some smaller open reading frames
(ORFs) such as E, M, and ORF6 were preserved (Fig. 3). These could have adapted to humans, but
they are also conserved in various coronaviruses 20. If they remain conserved, they could be
subjected to herd immunity, extending the period between future epidemics. Evidently, this does
not mean that these ORFs do not change forever; the rate of change is just slower.

The strain responsible for the pandemic has mutated rapidly. As of March, the bases of PCs 1 and 2
were formed, and each continent harboured the same set of mutated variants (Fig. 1). Since then,
human movement has been restricted, and each country accumulated its own variants. In this
process, the force that caused the mutations was probably adaptation to humans (Table 1). It caused
changes in both codon usage and protein structure (Extended Data Fig. 1 and 4), but the rate of
missense mutations was high (Extended Data Table 1).
Some particularly infectious variants of the virus crossed borders and became the cause of the
second wave in many countries (Extended Data Fig. 6). A Group 0 variant, which has caused the
epidemic in Spain in July, was detected in other EU countries about a month later, leaving the same
fingerprints in the PCs (panels B, D, F, I, and L). In countries other than France, this strain formed
second waves (Fig. 2 and Extended Data Fig. 6). In France, a Group 2 variant was prevalent at that
time (Extended Data Fig. 6H); currently, this pan-European variant is spreading at a rapid rate
(panel I). The pan-European variant has also reached the USA, Japan, and Australia; however, the
sequences of the epidemic variant are unknown in Japan and in the USA, though these countries are
amidst waves of infection. Australia seems to have succeeded in controlling this variant (panel O).
The unique variants in each country would serve as the source of newer variants, which are more
infectious than the previous variants; therefore, they replaced the mode (Fig. 2 and Extended Data
Fig. 6). If countries had not closed their national borders, many of their variants could have been
replaced by other more powerful variants, as in the case of group 3. However, the unique variants
survived in a narrower area; the variant that is causing the epidemic in South Africa would be an
example. International events, such as the Olympic Games, which attract people in large numbers,
will serve as an exchange market for these viruses. To make matters worse, coronavirus could
acquire shift-type mutations, resulting in a mixture of genomes 20. When an exported strain is

mixed with a domestic strain, a new strain is created. If each of the unique mutations works
independently (otherwise, replacement of the older variants with these variants would not be
beneficial), the accumulation of the mutations can result in the production of more powerful viruses
with cherry-picked the surviving unique mutations.
The epidemics showed much variation among the countries (Extended Data Fig. 6). A Group 2
variant that caused the second wave in the USA (panels M and N) migrated to Australia a few
months later (panel P). However, in contrast to the USA where the epidemic did not settle down,
Australia quickly suppressed the second wave. Furthermore, New Zealand did not even let an
epidemic occur. It should be noted that Sweden, which did not enforce a lockdown, could not
control the pan-European variant (panels K and L). Before this variant, the Swedish measures had
worked well and the infection was avoided simply by social distancing. However, the panEuropean variant was so infectious that it negated those defenses. The responsive measures of
various countries should be compared in detail for future pandemic.
