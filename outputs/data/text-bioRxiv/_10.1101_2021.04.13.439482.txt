Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of
a global pandemic that has led to more than 2.8 million deaths worldwide. Safe and effective
vaccines are now available, including Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) that showed
94% efficacy in prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 disease in a phase 3 clinical study. mRNA1273 encodes for a prefusion stabilized full length spike (S) protein of the Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate.
However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has led to concerns of viral escape from
vaccine-induced immunity. Several emerging variants have shown decreased susceptibility to
neutralization by vaccine induced immunity, most notably the B.1.351 variant, although the overall
impact on vaccine efficacy remains to be determined. Here, we present the initial evaluation in
mice of two updated COVID-19 mRNA vaccines designed to target emerging SARS-CoV-2
variants: (1) monovalent mRNA-1273.351 encodes for the S protein found in the B.1.351 lineage
and (2) mRNA-1273.211 comprising a 1:1 mix of mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351. Both
vaccines were evaluated as a 2-dose primary series in mice; mRNA-1273.351 was also evaluated
as a booster dose in animals previously vaccinated with 2-doses of mRNA-1273. The results
demonstrated that a primary vaccination series of mRNA-1273.351 was effective at increasing
neutralizing antibody titers against the B.1.351 lineage, while mRNA-1273.211 was most effective
at providing broad cross-variant neutralization in mice. In addition, these results demonstrated a
third dose of mRNA-1273.351 significantly increased both wild-type and B.1.351-specific
neutralization titers. Both mRNA-1273.351 and mRNA-1273.211 are currently being evaluated in
additional pre-clinical challenge models and in phase 1/2 clinical studies.

Introduction
Since the declaration of a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11,
2020, infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led
to more than 2.8 million deaths worldwide.1,2 Shortly after the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence was
determined, mRNA-1273, a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulated messenger RNA-based
vaccine encoding for a prefusion stabilized full-length spike (S) glycoprotein of the Wuhan-Hu-1
isolate of SARS-CoV-2, was developed.3,4 Vaccination with two 100 µg doses of mRNA-1273 4weeks apart was 94% efficacious against symptomatic COVID-19 disease; mRNA-1273 was
granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration in December
2020.5,6
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with substitutions in the receptor binding domain
(RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) of the viral S protein has raised concerns among scientists
and health officials.7-10 The entry of coronavirus into host cells is mediated by interaction between
the RBD of the viral S protein and the host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).3,1114

Several studies have shown that the RBD is the main target of neutralizing antibodies against

SARS-CoV-2.4,15-17 A neutralization “supersite” has also been identified in the NTD.18 A decrease
in vaccine-mediated viral neutralization has been correlated with amino acid substitutions in the
RBD (eg, K417T/N, E484K, and N501Y) and NTD (eg, L18F, D80A, D215G, and Δ242-244) of
the S protein. Importantly, some of the most recently circulating variants with key mutations in
the RBD and NTD, including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.526, and B.1.427/B.1.429/CAL.20C
lineages, have shown reduced susceptibility to neutralization from convalescent serum and
resistance to monoclonal antibodies.18-25 Importantly, mutations in the NTD domain, and
specifically the neutralization supersite, are extensive in the B.1.351 lineage virus.18

Using 2 orthogonal pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) assays based on vesicular stomatitis
virus (VSV) and lentivirus expressing S variants, neutralizing capacity of sera from phase 1
participants and non-human primates (NHPs) that received 2 doses of mRNA-1273 was reported.26
No significant impact on neutralization against the B.1.1.7 variant was observed; however, reduced
neutralization was measured against the B.1.351 variant, and to a lesser extent, in the P.1,
B.1.427/B.1.429 and B.1.1.7+E484K variants.26 Clinical studies in South Africa demonstrated
reduced efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 disease for the NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax),
AZD1222 (University of Oxford/AstraZeneca), and Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson)
vaccines.27-29 Pfizer/BioNTech has recently issued a press release reporting high efficacy in a study
with a small number of recipients of the mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine conducted in the same
population; however, a report from Israel suggests increased breakthrough infection rates by
B.1.351 in BNT162b2 vaccinated individuals.30,31 Studies have demonstrated reduced
neutralization titers against the full B.1.351 variant following mRNA-1273 vaccination, although
levels are still significant and expected to be protective based on challenge studies in NHPs.30,31
Despite this prediction of continued efficacy of mRNA-1273 against this key variant of concern
(VOC), the magnitude and duration of vaccine mediated protection is still unknown. Moreover, a
key related question is whether development of new mRNA vaccines to match the B.1.351 variant
will enable enhanced neutralization responses and durability.
Herein we present the design and preclinical evaluation of updated mRNA-1273 vaccines
against SARS-CoV-2 variants, which include monovalent mRNA-1273.351 and a multivalent
mRNA-1273.211. Like mRNA-1273, mRNA-1273.351 encodes the prefusion stabilized S protein
of SARS-CoV-2; however, in contrast to mRNA-1273, mRNA-1273.351 incorporates key
mutations present in the B.1.351 variant, including L18F, D80A, D215G, Δ242-244, R246I,

K417N, E484K, N501Y, D614G, A701V (Figure 1). To expand the breadth of coverage to
multiple circulating variants as well as the ancestral wild-type virus that is still circulating globally,
mRNA-1273.211 is a 1:1 mix of mRNA-1273 and mRNA-1273.351. Two initial studies were
performed in BALB/c mice to evaluate the immunogenicity of mRNA-1273.351 or mRNA1273.211 as a primary series and/or as a booster. The first study assessed the immunogenicity of
a primary series (day 0, 21) of mRNA-1273.351 or mRNA-1273.211 versus mRNA-1273. A
second study evaluated the immunogenicity of a third (booster) dose of mRNA-1273.351 213 days
after mice were vaccinated with a primary series of mRNA-1273, and immunogenicity was
assessed before and after the booster dose.

Methods
Preclinical vaccine mRNA and LNP production process. A sequence-optimized mRNA encoding
prefusion-stabilized Wuhan-Hu-1 or B.1.351-variant SARS-CoV-2 S-2P protein was synthesized
in vitro using an optimized T7 RNA polymerase-mediated transcription reaction with complete
replacement of uridine by N1m-pseudouridine.32 The reaction included a DNA template
containing the immunogen open-reading frame flanked by 5’ UTR and 3’ UTR sequences and was
terminated by an encoded polyA tail. After transcription, the cap 1 structure was added to the 5’
end using Vaccinia capping enzyme (New England Biolabs) and Vaccinia 2’O-methyltransferase
(New England Biolabs). The mRNA was purified by oligo-dT affinity purification, buffer
exchanged by tangential flow filtration into sodium acetate, pH 5.0, sterile filtered, and kept frozen
at –20°C until further use.
The mRNA was encapsulated in a LNP through a modified ethanol-drop nanoprecipitation
process described previously.33 Briefly, ionizable, structural, helper, and polyethylene glycol lipids
were mixed with mRNA in acetate buffer, pH 5.0, at a ratio of 2.5:1 (lipids:mRNA). The mixture
was neutralized with Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, sucrose was added as a cryoprotectant, and the final
solution was sterile filtered. Vials were filled with formulated LNP and stored frozen at –70°C
until further use. The drug product underwent analytical characterization, which included the
determination of particle size and polydispersity, encapsulation, mRNA purity, double stranded
RNA content, osmolality, pH, endotoxin, and bioburden, and the material was deemed acceptable
for in vivo study.
Mouse model. Animal experiments were carried out in compliance with approval from the Animal
Care and Use Committee of Moderna Inc. Female BALB/c mice (6-8 weeks old; Charles River
Laboratories) were used. mRNA formulations were diluted in 50 µL of 1X phosphate buffered

saline (PBS), and mice were inoculated via intramuscular injection into the same hind leg for both
prime, boost, and third dose. Control mice received PBS because prior studies have demonstrated
that tested mRNA formulations do not create significant levels of non-specific immunity beyond
a few days.34-36 Experiments were neither randomized nor blinded.
Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Microtiter plates (96-well; Thermo) were coated
with 1 µg/mL S-2P protein (Genscript) corresponding to the S protein of the Wuhan-Hu-1 virus.
After overnight incubation at 4°C, plates were washed 4 times with PBS/0.05% Tween-20 and
blocked for 1.5 h at 37°C (SuperBlock-Thermo). After washing, 5-fold serial dilutions of mouse
serum were added (assay diluent: 0.05% Tween-20 and 5% goat serum in PBS). Plates were
incubated for 2 h at 37°C, washed and HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Southern Biotech)
was added at a 1:20,000 dilution (S-2P) in assay diluent. Plates were incubated for 1 h at 37°C,
washed and bound antibody was detected with TMB substrate (SeraCare). After incubation for 10
m at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by adding TMB stop solution (SeraCare) and the
absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Titers were determined using a 4-parameter logistic curve
fit in GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.) and defined as the reciprocal dilution at
approximately OD450 = 1.0 (normalized to a mouse standard on each plate).
Recombinant VSV-based PsVN assay. Codon-optimized full-length S protein of the original
Wuhan-Hu-1 variant with D614G mutation (D614G) or the indicated S variants listed in Table 1
were cloned into pCAGGS vector. To make SARS-CoV-2 full-length S pseudotyped recombinant
VSV-ΔG-firefly luciferase virus, BHK-21/WI-2 cells (Kerafast) were transfected with the S
expression plasmid and subsequently infected with VSV∆G-firefly-luciferase as previously
described.37 For neutralization assay, serially diluted serum samples were mixed with pseudovirus
and incubated at 37°C for 45 m. The virus-serum mix was subsequently used to infect A5497

hACE2-TMPRSS2 cells for 18 h at 37°C before adding ONE-Glo reagent (Promega) for
measurement of luciferase signal (relative luminescence unit; RLU). The percentage of
neutralization was calculated based on RLU of the virus only control, and subsequently analyzed
using four-parameter logistic curve (Prism 8).
Statistical Analysis. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was used for the statistical analysis.
Results
mRNA-1273.351 and mRNA-1273.211 are immunogenic as a primary vaccination series in
mice. The immunogenicity of mRNA-1273.351 and mRNA-1273.211 vaccines against the
original Wuhan-Hu-1 variant with the D614G mutation (referred to as wild-type) and the B.1.351
variant was evaluated in BALB/c mice 2 weeks after the first and second injection (Figure 1).
Animals were vaccinated with 1 or 10 µg of mRNA-1273, mRNA-1273.351, or mRNA-1273.211
on a 0, 21-day schedule (Figure 2a). S protein binding antibody titers were assessed using a
Wuhan-Hu-1 S-2P ELISA. In addition, neutralizing antibody titers were assessed in a VSV-based
PsVN assay against wild-type and variant viruses (Table 1).
High levels of binding antibody were elicited by vaccination in all animals 2 weeks after
the first and second injection, with 4.5–9.4-fold increased S-2P binding titers measured after the
second dose (Figure 2b). Slightly lower antibody levels were observed for mRNA-1273.351
compared with mRNA-1273, potentially due to the coating S-2P protein used in the ELISA being
homologous to mRNA-1273. These results demonstrate that both mRNA-1273.351 and mRNA1273.211 are immunogenic in mice.
Vaccine mRNA-1273 elicited higher neutralization titers against the D614G than B.1.351
pseudovirus (Figure 3a,b), although the approximate 2-fold difference was smaller

than

previously measured with phase 1 clinical trial sera.26 mRNA-1273.351 elicited higher
neutralization titers against B.1.351 compared with the D614G pseudovirus (Figure 3a,c), with an
approximate 4-fold difference in measured titers. When the mRNA-1273.211 was used to
vaccinate mice, similar neutralization titers were elicited against both the D614G and B.1.351
pseudoviruses (Figure 3a,d), with no significant difference in neutralization titers. Thus,
vaccination of mice with mRNA-1273.351 elicited high levels of neutralizing antibody against the
B.1.351 pseudovirus and comparably lower levels versus D614G, while the multivalent mRNA1273.211 vaccine stimulated robust neutralization responses against both D614G and B.1.351
pseudoviruses.
Sera from mice collected 2 weeks after the second injection was also assessed against
SARS-CoV-2 variants that emerged in Brazil (P.1) and California (B.1.427/B.1.429 or CAL.20C).
As described in Table 1, some of the mutations in these variants were different from both the
Wuhan-Hu-1 and B.1.351 lineages, although the RBD mutations (K417T/N, E484K, N501Y) are
common to both the P.1 and B.1.351 viruses. As observed in previous assessments of NHPs and
clinical trial sera,26 mice vaccinated with mRNA-1273 showed an approximate 2-fold reduction in
neutralizing antibody levels against both the CAL.20C and P.1 variants (Figure 4). These
reductions in neutralization titers against CAL.20C and P.1 variants were more pronounced in mice
vaccinated with mRNA-1273.351 (3.7-fold and 2.6-fold reductions in geometric mean titers
(GMTs) for mRNA-1273.351 compared with mRNA-1273, respectively). However, the
multivalent mRNA-1273.211 vaccine neutralized these variants similarly than mRNA-1273.
mRNA-1273.351 is an effective third (booster) dose in animals previously vaccinated with a
primary vaccination series of mRNA-1273. To evaluate the ability of the mRNA-1273.351 to
boost pre-existing immunity and increase neutralization against both the wild-type and the B.1.351

virus, BALB/c mice were immunized with 1 or 0.1 µg mRNA-1273 on day 1 and 22, and the level
and durability of the antibody responses were evaluated over the course of 7 months. Sera
collection occurred on day 212, and a third dose of 1 or 0.1 µg mRNA-1273.351 was administered
on day 213 (Figure 5a).
High levels of binding antibody were elicited by vaccination with mRNA-1273, with peak
titers measured 2 weeks after the second dose (Figure 5b). After an initial drop in antibody levels,
titers were stable over the 7-month monitoring period. Following the mRNA-1273.351 booster
injection, antibody levels dramatically rose, exceeding the previously measured peak for both the
1 and 0.1 µg dose levels.
Neutralization titers were measured in the D614G PsVN assay on day 36 and 212, 1 day
prior to injection of the third dose. Titers remained high, with an ~1.5-fold drop measured over
that period. Of note, neutralizing titers at day 212 were measured in both the D614G and B.1.351
PsVN assays (Figure 6a,c), with 6.6-fold higher titers measured in the D614G PsVN assay; this
difference is similar to neutralization reductions observed with sera of NHPs and humans who
received 2 doses of mRNA-1273 and increases the potential correlation of this animal model to
what may be observed in humans.
The third dose of mRNA-1273.351 increased neutralization titers 4.5- and 15-fold in the
D614G and B.1.351 PsVN assays, respectively (Figure 6a,b). The difference between the 2 assays
narrowed to 2-fold following the booster dose (Figure 6c); the GMT of 15,524 against B.1.351
was ~1.5 fold higher than the peak titer against D614G 2 weeks after the second dose (Figure
6a,d). Animals vaccinated at the 0.1 µg dose level had lower titers, but similar trends for binding
antibody and neutralization titers were observed (data not shown).

Discussion
In this study, mRNA-1273.351 and mRNA-1273.211 were evaluated in mice as both a
primary vaccination series and as a third booster dose in animals previously vaccinated with 2
injections of mRNA-1273. As a primary vaccination series, both vaccines were potently
immunogenic after the first injection, with both S-2P binding and neutralizing antibody titers
significantly increasing after the second injection. Neutralizing activity of mRNA-1273.351
against the D614G variant was 4-fold lower than that against the B.1.351 variant and 6.3-fold
lower against D614G variant compared to mRNA-1273. In contrast, the multivalent mRNA1273.211 vaccine elicited robust and comparable neutralizing titers against both D614G and
B.1.351, which closely match those observed against D614G after mRNA-1273 vaccination. Thus,
as a primary vaccination series, a multivalent approach appears most effective in broadening
immune responses, as neutralization potency was enhanced against both B.1.351 and P.1 versus
mRNA-1273 and remained significant against B.1.427/B.1.429/CAL.20C.
mRNA-1273.351 was evaluated as a booster injection in mice vaccinated with mRNA1273 approximately 7 months previously. The third dose of mRNA-1273.351 dramatically boosted
both S-2P binding antibody titers (Figure 5) and D614G and B.1.351 PsV neutralization titers
(Figure 6). Neutralizing titers against B.1.351 PsV increased to levels well above the peak
neutralizing titer against D614G after the second dose of mRNA-1273, the latter of which was
fully protective in mice challenged with the mouse-adapted USA-WA1/2020 isolate.38 In addition,
the booster dose also increased neutralizing titers against D614G, although the fold-increase was
less than that against B.1.351, as expected. Overall, the third injection of mRNA-1273.351
dramatically increased both D614G and B.1.351 neutralization titers, with titers much higher than
the day 36 peak. Further, the difference in titers measured in the D614G and B.1.351 PsVN assays

decreased from a 6.6-fold difference prior to the boosting dose to a 2-fold difference 2 weeks after
the third dose.
The number of animals available for boosting in this study allowed evaluation of only 1
boosting scenario (ie, mRNA-1273.351). Ongoing studies will evaluate the ability of mRNA-1273,
mRNA-1273.351, and mRNA-1273.211 to effectively boost immunity driven by a primary
vaccination series of mRNA-1273. Studies will also evaluate mRNA-1273.351 and mRNA1273.211 in additional primary vaccination and boosting studies in mice, Golden Syrian Hamsters,
and rhesus macaques, with either Wuhan-Hu-1 or B.1.351 challenge planned. These studies are
designed to assess the level of neutralization of sera derived from vaccinated animals against PsVs
with either the Wuhan-Hu-1 D614G or the B.1.351 S proteins and the level of protection provided
against Wuhan-Hu-1 and B.1.351 challenge. Global surveillance for the emergence of additional
SARS-CoV-2 VOC and efforts in testing the neutralization of VOCs by mRNA-1273 vaccinee
sera is also ongoing. If additional variants emerge that reduce the neutralization capacity of
mRNA-1273 further, additional mRNA vaccine designs may be developed and evaluated. In this
study, the multivalent mRNA-1273.211 has already demonstrated to be an immunogenic strategy
against multiple variants, and ongoing pre-clinical and clinical studies will provide further
evidence of the utility of using a booster dose of mRNA-1273.211. This approach also supports
seasonal adjustment, allowing for changes in response to the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Several potential limitations to the current study should be highlighted. Sera from mRNA1273 vaccinated NHP or human sera was shown to have 6-8 fold reduced neutralizing activity
against the B.1.351 variant SARS-CoV-2 in several assessments, although the level of
neutralization remained at levels that are predicted to be protective.26,39 Results in this study,
however, showed that after the primary series of mRNA-1273, only a 2-fold reduced neutralization

against the B.1.351 virus was evident 2 weeks after the second dose. A 6.6-fold reduction was seen
at day 212, more relevant to what has been measured from human sera. Further studies in animal
species more predictive of responses in humans such as non-human primates as well as clinical
studies in humans are ongoing. Further, only mRNA-1273.351 was evaluated as a third dose. The
ability of the multivalent mRNA-1273.211 to boost immunity against both the D614G and B.1.351
viruses has not yet been assessed, although this type of cross-variant boosting is expected. Finally,
very little antibody waning was measured in the 7-month evaluation of antibody levels in mice
prior to the delivery of the boosting dose. This level of durability may not be reflective of that
measured in NHPs or humans.40
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and the ability of the virus to partially overcome
natural or vaccine-induced immunity served as a call to action. Not only are continued vaccination
efforts needed to prevent the emergence of future VOCs, but strategies are needed for new SARSCoV-2 vaccine research and development that can enhance the level of protection against key
VOCs should they arise. The mRNA platform approach against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs has now been
demonstrated in mice to be effective at broadening neutralization across variants and to boost
antibody levels when applied as a third dose, with mitigation of the significant reduction in
neutralization seen against the B.1.351 lineage. The mRNA platform allows for rapid design of
vaccine antigens that incorporate key mutations, allowing for rapid future development of
alternative variant-matched vaccines should they be needed. The designs evaluated in this study
demonstrated potent cross-variant neutralization as a primary series and the ability to evolve the
immune response through boosting; additional VOC designs can be rapidly developed and
deployed in the future if needed to address the evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus.
