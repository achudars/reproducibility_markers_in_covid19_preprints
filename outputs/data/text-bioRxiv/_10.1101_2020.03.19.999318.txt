Abstract

29

Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is an emerging global health crisis. With over 7 million

30

confirmed cases to date, this pandemic continues to expand, spurring research to discover

31

vaccines and therapies. SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus responsible for this disease. It

32

initiates entry into human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via the

33

receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein (S). Disrupting the SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding

34

to ACE2 with designer drugs has the potential to inhibit the virus from entering human cells,

35

presenting a new modality for therapeutic intervention. Peptide-based binders are an attractive

36

solution to inhibit the RBD-ACE2 interaction by adequately covering the extended protein contact

37

interface. Using molecular dynamics simulations based on the recently solved cryo-EM structure

38

of ACE2 in complex with SARS-CoV-2-RBD, we observed that the ACE2 peptidase domain (PD)

39

α1 helix is important for binding SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Using automated fast-flow peptide synthesis,

40

we chemically synthesized a 23-mer peptide fragment of the ACE2 PD α1 helix (SBP1) composed

41

entirely of proteinogenic amino acids. Chemical synthesis of SBP1 was complete in 1.5 hours,

42

and after work up and isolation >20 milligrams of pure material was obtained. Bio-layer

43

interferometry (BLI) revealed that SBP1 associates with micromolar affinity to insect-derived

44

SARS-CoV-2-RBD protein obtained from Sino Biological. Association of SBP1 was not observed

45

to an appreciable extent to HEK cell-expressed SARS-CoV-2-RBD proteins and insect-derived

46

variants acquired from other vendors. Moreover, competitive BLI assays showed SBP1 does not

47

outcompete ACE2 binding to Sino Biological insect-derived SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Further

48

investigations are ongoing to gain insight into the molecular and structural determinants of the

49

variable binding behavior to different SARS-CoV-2-RBD protein variants.

1. Introduction

54

A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) from Wuhan, China, has caused over 7 million

55

confirmed cases and over 400,000 deaths globally, according to the COVID-19 situation report

56

from WHO on June 10, 2020 (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-

57

2019/situation-reports/), and the number is continually growing. Similar to the SARS-CoV

58

outbreak in 2002, SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory problems. Coughing, fever, difficulties

59

in breathing and/or shortage of breath are the common symptoms. Aged patients with pre-existing

60

medical conditions are at most risk with a mortality rate ~1.5% or even higher in some regions.

61

Moreover, human-to-human transmission can occur rapidly by close contact. To slow this

62

pandemic and treat infected patients, rapid development of specific antiviral drugs is of the highest

63

urgency.

64

The closely-related SARS-CoV coronavirus invades host cells by binding the angiotensin-

65

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on human cell surface through its viral spike protein (S) [1-

66

4]. It was recently established that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor for host cell entry and

67

binds ACE2 with an affinity comparable with the corresponding spike protein of SARS-CoV [5, 6].

68

Recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structural studies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

69

receptor binding domain (RBD) in complex with full-length human ACE2 receptor revealed key

70

amino acid residues at the contact interface between the two proteins and estimated the binding

71

affinity at ~15 nM [7, 8]. These studies provide valuable information that can be leveraged for the

72

development of disruptors specific for the SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 protein-protein interaction (PPI).

73

Small-molecule inhibitors are often less effective at disrupting extended protein binding interfaces

74

[9]. Peptides, on the other hand, offer a synthetically accessible solution to disrupt PPIs by binding

75

at interface regions containing multiple contact “hot spots” [10].

76

We hypothesized that disruption of the viral SARS-CoV-2-RBD/host ACE2 interaction with

77

peptide-based binders would prevent virus entry into human cells, offering a novel opportunity for

78

therapeutic intervention. To investigate this hypothesis, we launched a campaign to design and

79

discover minimum-length peptide binders to SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Notably, coronavirus spike

80

proteins have been previously targeted with peptide-based fragments, such as an extended ACE2

81

helical mimic developed against SARS-CoV-RBD [11], pan-CoV inhibitors of the fusion of the

82

spike S2 subunit with the cell membrane [12, 13], and an 85-mer N-terminal truncate of the ACE2

83

protein that binds SARS-CoV-2-RBD with nanomolar affinity [14].

84

approaches, our efforts aimed to determine the minimum length required for an ACE2 N-terminal

85

peptide fragment that maintains specific association with SARS-CoV-2-RBD.

Complementing these

86

Analyzing the cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV-2-RBD/ACE2 complex, we found that

87

the binding interface spans a large elongated surface area, as is common for PPIs. We leveraged

88

molecular dynamics simulations and automated fast-flow peptide synthesis [15] to prepare a 23-

89

mer peptide binder (SBP1) to SARS-CoV-2-RBD, the sequence of which was derived from the

90

ACE2 α1 helix. Using bio-layer interferometry (BLI), we determined that N-terminal biotinylated

91

SBP1 binds Sino Biological insect-derived SARS-CoV-2-RBD with micromolar affinity

92

(dissociation constant, KD = 1.3 µM). We also found, however, that N-terminal biotinylated SBP1

93

does not associate with HEK-expressed SARS-CoV-2-RBD or insect-derived variants purchased

94

from other commercial sources. Although biotinylated SBP1 binds Sino Biological insect-derived

95

SARS-CoV-2-RBD when immobilized on BLI streptavidin tips, no specific disruption of the SARS-

96

CoV-2-RBD/ACE2 interaction was observed in solution in a BLI competition assay. Further

97

investigation is currently ongoing to understand the different association behaviors of this ACE2-

98

derived peptide to SARS-CoV-2-RBD protein variants.

103

RBD was simulated under TIP3P explicit water conditions. Analyzing the simulation trajectory

104

after 200 ns, we found that SBP1 remains on the spike RBD protein surface in a stable

105

conformation (Fig. 2B) with overall residue fluctuations smaller than 0.8 nm compared with their

106

starting coordinates (Fig. 2A). Per-residue analysis along the 200 ns trajectory showed that the

107

middle residues of SBP1, a 12-mer sequence we termed SBP2, have significantly reduced

108

fluctuations (Fig. 2C, 2D), indicating key interactions. The results of this MD simulation suggest

109

that SBP1 and SBP2 peptides derived from the ACE-PD α1 helix may alone potentially bind the

110

SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD protein with sufficient affinity to disrupt the associated PPI.

111

Automated fast-flow peptide synthesis yields >95% pure compound

112

The two N-terminal biotinylated peptides, SBP1 and SBP2, derived from the α1 helix were

113

prepared by automated fast-flow peptide synthesis[15, 17] with a total synthesis time of 1.5 h over

114

35 coupling cycles. After cleavage from resin, global deprotection, and subsequent C18 solid-

115

phase extraction, the purity of the crude peptides was estimated to be >95% for both biotinylated

116

SBP1 and SBP2 based on LC-MS TIC chromatograms (Supplemental Fig. 1). We assessed this

117

purity as acceptable for direct downstream biological characterization.

118

SBP1 peptide binds Sino Biological insect-derived SARS-CoV-2-RBD with micromolar

127

global fitting algorithm and 1:1 binding model (Fig. 2E). However, SBP1 did not associate with the

128

other three SARS-CoV-2-RBD proteins studied (Fig. 2E). Surprisingly, a scrambled sequence of

129

SBP1 exhibited binding to the Sino Biological insect-derived SARS-CoV-2-RBD with comparable

130

association response to SBP1 at 500 nM concentration (Fig. 2E). SBP1 had no observable

131

binding to a negative control human protein menin (Fig. 2F). Likewise, no association was

132

observed between the biotinylated 12-mer SBP2 and Sino Biological insect-derived SARS-CoV-

133

2-RBD (Fig. 2F).

134

SBP1 does not compete with biotinylated ACE2 binding to Sino Biological insect-derived

135

SARS-CoV-2-RBD

136

Using a competition-format BLI assay, we confirmed that soluble human ACE2 protein

137

could compete with immobilized biotinylated ACE2 (AcroBiosystems) for binding Sino Biological

138

insect-derived SARS-CoV-2-RBD, and that a 5-fold excess of soluble ACE2 (relative to

139

immobilized biotinylated ACE2) abolished nearly all of the initial ACE2/RBD binding interaction

140

(Fig. 3B, 3D). However, competition was not observed when using non-biotinylated SBP1 pre-

141

mixed in solution with Sino Biological insect-derived SARS-CoV-2-RBD, even with a 1000-fold

142

excess of the peptide (Fig. 3C, 3E). These data suggest that SBP1 potentially binds SARS-CoV-

143

2-RBD at a different site than ACE2, binds SARS-CoV-2-RBD too weakly, or for other unknown

144

reasons cannot disrupt the native ACE2/RBD interaction.

145

3. Discussion

146

Recently published cryo-EM structures of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 in complex with human

147

ACE2 have identified this PPI as a key step for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells [7, 8].

148

Blocking this binding interface represents a highly promising therapeutic strategy, as it could

149

potentially hinder cellular uptake of SARS-CoV-2 and intracellular replication.

150

Drugging PPIs is a longstanding challenge in traditional drug discovery and peptide-based

151

approaches might help to solve this problem. Small molecule compounds are unlikely to bind

152

large protein surfaces that do not have distinct binding pockets. Peptides, on the other hand,

153

display a larger surface area and chemical functionalities that can mimic and disrupt the native

154

PPI, as is the case for the clinically approved HIV peptide drug Fuzeon [18, 19].

155

The identification of a suitable starting point for drug discovery campaigns can be time-

156

intensive. During a pandemic such as this one, therapeutic interventions are urgently needed.

157

Peptide-based strategies were developed to target both the spike protein RBD and S2 subunit of

158

the first SARS-CoV virus [11,12]. Translating these approaches to SARS-CoV-2, inhibitors of the

159

spike protein fusion with the cell membrane and engineered mini-proteins that bind SARS-CoV-2

160

RBD were developed [13,14]. We aimed to determine the minimum length required of the ACE2

161

N-terminal peptide fragment in order to maintain binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2-RBD and thus

162

potentially deliver a synthetically accessible therapeutic candidate. To rapidly identify potential

163

short peptide binders to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we used molecular dynamics (MD)

164

simulation on peptides extracted from the human ACE2 sequence. The starting point of the

165

binding simulations was the cryo-EM model of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and several

166

peptides derived from the SARS-CoV-2-spike binding domain of human ACE2 protein. Our MD

167

simulation (200 ns trajectory) indicated that the SBP1 peptide, corresponding to the N-terminal

168

ACE2 α1 helix, stably bound to SARS-CoV-2-RBD. The overall peptide fluctuations were smaller

169

than 0.8 nm from the starting coordinates (Fig. 2A). These results indicated the potential of

170

identifying a short SARS-CoV-2-RBD-binding peptide derived from the human ACE2 α1 helix.

171

A 23-mer peptide sequence (SBP1) was synthesized by automated flow peptide synthesis

172

[15].

175

lines of published data [8, 20]. We used this peptide (SBP1) as an experimental starting point for

176

the development of a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binder. Our rapid automated flow peptide

177

synthesizer enabled the synthesis of tens of milligrams of SBP1 peptide within 1.5 h. The crude

178

purity was determined to be >95% and therefore sufficient for binding validation by BLI.

179

The interaction between N-terminal biotinylated SBP1 and the RBD of glycosylated SARS-

180

CoV-2 spike protein was investigated in detail. We performed serial dilutions of the soluble protein

181

to reliably determine the binding affinity of SBP1 to Sino Biological insect-derived SARS-CoV-2-

182

RBD. Using a global fitting algorithm, we found that N-terminal biotinylated SBP1 binds Sino

183

Biological insect-derived SARS-CoV-2-RBD with micromolar affinity (KD = 1.3 µM), a value almost

184

100-times higher than the estimated binding affinity of the native ACE2 receptor (KD ~ 15 nM [7])

185

(Fig. 2E). The decreased binding affinity relative to ACE2 may partially explain why SBP1 was

186

unable to significantly disrupt ACE2 binding to Sino Biological insect-derived SARS-CoV-2-RBD

187

even at 1000-fold excess in a BLI competition assay (Fig. 3C,E). In addition, the comparable

188

affinity observed for a scrambled sequence of SBP1 (Fig. 2E) suggests the possibility of a

189

promiscuous peptide binding site on the surface of glycosylated Sino Biological insect-derived

190

SARS-CoV-2-RBD at a different location than the one involved in ACE2 receptor binding.

191

An important outcome of our preliminary BLI binding studies relates to the significantly

192

different SBP1 association behavior observed toward the various SARS-CoV-2-RBD commercial

193

sources investigated. Among the four variants (two insect-derived and two HEK-expressed), Sino

194

Biological insect-derived SARS-CoV-2-RBD was the only one displaying observable association

195

with SBP1 in the BLI Octet assay. This behavior may be partially ascribed to variability in the site-

196

specific patterns and surface density of SARS-CoV-2-RBD post-translational modifications

197

(PTMs), in particular glycosylation [21], imparted by the different biological expression sources.

198

Distinct PTM patterns are evident in the different mass distribution envelopes obtained by

199

deconvolution of the Sino Biological insect-derived and HEK-expressed SARS-CoV-2-RBD

protein total ion current bands, respectively, analyzed by LC-MS (Supplemental Fig. 2). Access

201

to non-glycosylated SARS-CoV-2-RBD either by bacterial recombinant expression or total

202

chemical synthesis in flow [15] may provide additional insight into the role of glycans in modulating

203

peptide interactions with the SARS-CoV-2-RBD/ACE2 interface. Investigations along these lines

204

are in progress to gain additional understanding of these molecular processes.

205

In conclusion, a biotinylated peptide sequence derived from human ACE2 was found to

206

bind Sino Biological insect-derived SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD with micromolar affinity, but

207

did not associate with SARS-CoV-2-RBD variants obtained from other commercial sources. In

208

spite of this association, competitive BLI data indicates that SBP1, even at 1000-fold excess, did

209

not compete with ACE2 for binding to SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Our preliminary studies highlight the

210

unexpected challenges researchers may encounter while developing peptide-based approaches

211

to disrupt the specific interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with its mammalian cell membrane receptors.

212

At the same time, the BLI experiments draw attention to the wide variability in the behavior of the

213

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants in solution, likely a consequence of the biological expression

214

source, manufacturing and/or formulation protocols. The development of peptide-based

215

disruptors of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry effective in a clinical setting relies on a broader evaluation

216

and understanding of its spike protein isoforms.

range electrostatic interactions were calculated with particle mesh Ewald method, with non-

225

bonded cutoff set to 12.0 Å. SHAKE algorithm was used to constrain bonds involving hydrogen

226

atoms. Time step is 2 fs and the trajectories were recorded every 10 ps. After simulation

227

production runs, trajectory files were loaded into the VMD software for further analysis.

228

Automated fast-flow peptide synthesis

229

SBP1 and SBP2 sequences were synthesized at 90 °C on Rink Amide-ChemMatrix resin with

230

HATU activation using a fully automatic flow-based peptide synthesizer. Amide bond formation

231

was performed in 8 seconds, and Fmoc groups were removed in 8 seconds with 40% (v/v)

232

piperidine in DMF. The overall synthesis cycle was completed in ~120 seconds per amino acid

233

incorporated. After completion of fast-flow synthesis, the resins were washed with DMF (3 x) and

234

then incubated with HATU-activated biotin-PEG4-propionic acid (CAS# 721431-18-1) at room

235

temperature for 1.0 h for biotinylation on the peptide N-terminus.

236

Peptide cleavage and deprotection

237

After peptide synthesis, the peptidyl resin was rinsed with dichloromethane briefly and then dried

238

in a vacuum chamber overnight. Next day, approximately 5 mL of cleavage solution (94%

239

trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 1% TIPS, 2.5% EDT, 2.5% water) was added into the syringe containing

240

the resin. The syringe was kept at room temperature for 2 h before injecting the cleavage solution

241

into a 50 mL conical tube. Dry-ice cold diethyl ether (~50 mL) was added to the cleavage mixture

242

and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation and triturated twice with cold diethyl ether (50

243

mL). The supernatant was discarded. Residual ether was allowed to evaporate and the peptide

244

was dissolved in water with 0.1% TFA for solid-phase extraction.

Peptides were dissolved in water with 0.1% TFA followed by LC-MS analysis on an Agilent 6550

253

iFunnel ESI-Q-ToF instrument using an Agilent Jupiter C4 reverse-phase column (2.1 mm × 150

254

mm, 5 μm particle size). Mobile phases were 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1%

255

formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). Linear gradients of 1 to 61% solvent B over 15 minutes (flow

256

rate: 0.5 mL/min) were used to acquire LC-MS chromatograms.

A ForteBio Octet® RED96 Bio-Layer Interferometry system (Octet RED96, ForteBio, CA) was

streptavidin (SA) tips were dipped in 200 μL of biotinylated peptide solution (2.5 μM in 1x kinetic

were then sampled with four different sourced SARS-CoV-2-RBD proteins (Sino Biological insect-

263

derived RBD, CAT: 40592-V08B; Sino Biological HEK-expressed RBD, CAT: 40592-V08H;

Z03479) or menin protein at various concentrations in 1x kinetic buffer to obtain the association

266

curve. Peptide only was used as reference for background subtraction. After association, the tips

267

were dipped back into 1x kinetic buffer to obtain the dissociation curve. The association and

268

dissociation curves were fitted with ForteBio Biosystems using four experimental conditions (n =

269

In-solution BLI competition assay

273

A BLI competition binding assay was set up as previously described.[22] First, a calibration curve

274

was constructed using biotinylated ACE2 dipping into a serially-diluted Sino Biological insect-

275

derived SARS-CoV-2-RBD. In brief, streptavidin sensors were soaked in kinetic buffer (PBS

276

supplemented with 0.02% Tween-20, and 0.1% BSA) for 10 min at 30 °C, and loaded with

277

biotinylated ACE2 for 4 min. Then, serial dilutions of SARS-CoV-2-RBD in Kinetic buffer were

278

analyzed for binding, typically at 30 °C and 1,000 rpm. Second, with the binding information from

279

the calibration curve, a concentration of SARS-CoV-2-RBD protein at 100 nM was chosen to

280

premix with various concentration of SBP1 to study the competition effects. Briefly, different

281

concentration of SBP1 was incubated with 100 nM Sino Biological insect-derived SARS-CoV-2-

282

RBD protein at room temperature for 15 min. Meanwhile, streptavidin sensors were soaked into

283

kinetic buffer for 10 min at 30 °C. ACE2 was immobilized on the streptavidin sensor surface and

284

the association and dissociation curves of SARS-CoV-2-RBD in the preincubated samples were

285

then analyzed at 30 °C and 1,000 rpm.
