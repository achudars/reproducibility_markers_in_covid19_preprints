Abstract: Antibody neutralization is an important prognostic factor in many viral diseases. To easily
and rapidly measure titers of neutralizing antibodies in serum or plasma, we developed
pseudovirion particles composed of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 incorporated onto
murine leukemia virus capsids and a modified minimal MLV genome encoding firefly luciferase.
These pseudovirions provide a practical means of assessing immune responses under laboratory
conditions consistent with biocontainment level 2.

Introduction
Coronaviruses are a group of enveloped RNA viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded
RNA genome ranging from 26-32 kilobases, which can cause respiratory tract infections. In December
2019, a novel coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
was identified in China and has caused a global ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID19). To date, SARS-CoV-2 has spread to 188 countries (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/). More than 29
million cases and 900,000 deaths have been reported at the time of this writing.
Enveloped viruses are known to efficiently package their core elements with heterologous
envelope glycoproteins, giving rise to the so called 'pseudotypes' or 'pseudoviruses'. Many
laboratories have successfully generated pseudotypes containing the core elements of HIV-1 [1] or
MLV [2, 3] and the envelope glycoproteins of vesicular stomatitis virus [4], murine leukemia virus
[5], Lassa fever virus, ebola virus, coronavirus spike glycoproteins, and others (reviewed in [6]).
In a pseudotype virus, viral attachment [7], entry, and importantly, antibody binding and
neutralization sensitivity are dependent on the membrane glycoprotein provided [6]. Using a
defective MLV vector genome encoding firefly luciferase, and a packaging vector encoding MLV
gag/pol, we describe the production of pseudovirus particles containing the spike glycoprotein of
SARS-CoV-2. As controls, we also produced similar particles containing SARS-CoV-1, VSV-G or HIV1 LAI gp160.

SV-Psi--Env--MLV [8], pHIV-1 LAI gp160 [9], pHCMV-VSV-G [4] and pSIVmac gp130 [10] were
previously described . L-LUC-SN was constructed by inserting the firefly luciferase gene within the
polylinker of pLXSN (Clonetech, cat# 631509). pSARS-CoV-1 was purchased from Sino Biologicals.
pCAGGS expressing SARS-CoV-2 RBD was obtained from BEI Resources (cat#NR-52309). HEK293ThACE2 cells were a gift from Adam Bailey and Emma Winkler and were constructed as follows. A
DNA fragment containing a codon-optimized version of hACE2 (Genbank NM_021804) was inserted
into pLV-EF1a-IRES-Hygro (Addgene Plasmid #85134) using Gibson assembly. 293T cells were then
transduced with lentivirus made from this construct. The plasmid pcDNA3.1-SARS-2-S-C9 was a
generous gift from Tom Gallagher and expresses a codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2 spike open reading
frame with a deletion in the 19 carboxy-terminal deletion amino acids (an endoplasmic reticulum
retention signal) and addition of the C9 peptide TETSQVAPA, recognized by antibody 1D4.

The plasmid SV-Psi--Env--MLV and L-LUC-SN were co-transfected with or without an envelope
glycoprotein plasmid (pHCMV-VSV-G/pSARS-CoV-1/pSARS-CoV-2/pHIV-1 LAI gp160) into
HEK293FT cells using Lipofectamineä 3000 (ThermoFisher, US). Cell supernatants containing
viruses were collected after 2 days of transfection. Viruses were filtered through a 0.45µm filter (VWR,
US) and centrifuged at 4°C, 6500rpm for 18h over a 20% sucrose cushion. Viruses were resuspended
in 500µl cell culture medium and stored at -80°C.

HEK293FT, 293T-ACE2, and Huh7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (ThermoFisher, US) the
day before infection. SupT1 cells were added into a 96-well plate at the time of infection. 5x104 cells
were added to each well. Pseudotyped MLV viruses were added to the pre-cultured cells. Cells were
cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 2 days. All cells in each well were lysed and luciferase was measured
using ONE-Gloä Luciferase Assay reagent (Promega, US). RLUs are per well of a 96-well plate.

293T-ACE2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 5x104 cells per well the day prior to infection.
Sera from COVID-19-positive patients, negative sera, positive control (RBD) and negative control
(SIVgp130) were serially diluted in a volume of 100µL and pre-incubated with 50µL of pseudotyped
viruses at 37°C for 1h. For these infections, virus stocks were used at a dilution resulting in 100-200
RLU in the absence of serum. Cells were then infected with the serum/pseudovirion mixtures.
Luciferase was measured 48 hours post infection using ONE-Gloä Luciferase Assay reagent.
Neutralization titers NT50 and NT80 were calculated using Prism 8 (GraphPad, US).
Results
To generate pseudovirion particles, three plasmids were co-transfected into HEK293FT cells. The
first plasmid was the packaging construct, SV-Psi--Env--MLV; the second plasmid was L-LUC-SN, a
minimal retroviral transfer vector encoding the firefly luciferase reporter gene; the third plasmid was
an expression construct encoding one of the following membrane viral glycoproteins: SARS-CoV
spike (hereafter referred to as SARS-CoV-1), SARS-CoV-2 spike, HIV-1 LAI gp160 and VSV-G. VSVG pseudotyped virus is used as a positive control because of its high infectivity in most cell types.
HIV-1 LAI gp160-pseudotyped virus is used as a negative control as it utilizes CD4 as a primary
receptor, which is present in SupT1 cells but absent in HEK293T.
Pseudotyped MLV viruses were tested on HEK293FT, HEK293T-ACE2, Huh7 and SupT1 cells.
HEK293FT cells were used as a control cell line, which is known to lack of susceptibility of

coronavirus and HIV due to the absence of both ACE2 and CD4. As expected, VSV-G pseudotyped
viruses infected all cell types and showed the highest infectivity (Figure 1). HIV-1 LAI gp160pseudotyped viruses only infected SupT1 cells. Both SARS-CoV-1 spike pseudotyped virus and
SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotyped viruses infected 293T-ACE2 and Huh7 cells.
Since 293T-ACE2 cells showed the highest susceptibility to both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2
pseudotyped MLV viruses, further experiments were all performed in 293T-ACE2 cells. The ultimate
goal of our studies was to develop an antibody virus neutralization test based on the above
pseudotyped virus. To test for neutralization activity, serum samples from 12 de-identified COVID19 patients were tested for their ability to neutralize pseudotyped MLV viruses.. Samples 1-6 were
plasma obtained from patients who had a SARS-CoV-2 positive test for nucleocapsid-specific IgG
(Abbot; samples 1 and 12), spike-specific IgG (Euroimmun; samples 2, 4, 5, and 6) or Nucleic Acid
Amplification test (ARUP Laboratories; samples 3, and 8-11) either SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid ELISA
or SARS-CoV-2 PCR.
As shown in Figure 2, 11 out of 12 patient serum samples showed neutralizing activity against
SARS-CoV-2-spike pseudotyped MLV viruses, with neutralizing titers-50 (NT50) that ranged from
1:25 to 1:1,417. Eight out of the 12 samples displayed detectable NT80. We also tested five historical
samples from patients who were hospitalized for severe influenza infection in 2016, all of which
tested negative in the neutralization assay (NT50 < 25; Figure 3).
To test for specificity of neutralization, we asked whether neutralizing antibodies from SARSCoV-2 patients would exhibit cross-reactivity against a pseudotype expressing SARS-CoV-1 (Figure
4). We tested samples #1, 2 and 3, which had the highest NT50 and NT80. None of these sera had
detectable neutralizing activity (NT50 <25) against the SARS-CoV-1 pseudotype, which is consistent
with previous reports [11-13].
As a positive control and also as a standard to monitor variability between neutralization
experiments, we used recombinant soluble receptor binding domain from SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
We produced this protein via transient transfection in HEK293FT cells using a mammalian expression
vector (pCAGGS) encoding amino acids 319 to 542 of from SARS-CoV-2 S1, encompassing the RBD
(BEI Resources, cat.# NR-52309). The apparent NT50 of RBD against SARS-CoV-2 / MLV pseudotype
was 1:244. As a negative control for neutralization, the surface glycoprotein from the simian
immunodeficiency virus, SIVmac gp130 [10], was similarly produced by transfection.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a simple and rapid assay based on pseudovirion particles,
which should allow for specific measurement of neutralizing titers in plasma against SARS-CoV-2 in
the context of biocontainment level 2 laboratories. Using SARS-CoV-2 RBD as a control in this assay,
we observe that, as expected, SARS-CoV-2 RBD was able to block infection with SARS-CoV-2.
