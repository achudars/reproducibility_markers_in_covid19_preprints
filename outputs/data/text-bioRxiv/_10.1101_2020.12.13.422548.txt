ABSTRACT

Context: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged late in 2019 is the
etiologic agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). There is an urgent need to develop curative and
preventive therapeutics to limit the current pandemic and to prevent the re-emergence of Covid-19. This
study aimed to assess the in vitro activity of copper gluconate against SRAS-CoV-2.
Methods: Vero E6 cells were treated with copper gluconate 18 hours before infection. Cells were infected
with a recombinant GFP expressing SARS-CoV-2. Infected cells were maintained in fresh medium containing
copper gluconate for an additional 48-hour period. The infection level was measured by the confocal
microscopy-based high content screening method. The cell viability in presence of copper gluconate was
assessed by XTT assay.
Results: The viability of Vero E6 cells treated with copper gluconate up to 200 µM was found to be similar
to that of untreated cells, but it dropped below 40% with 400 µM of this agent. The infection rate was
23.8%, 18.9%, 20.6%, 6.9%, 5.3%,5.2% in cells treated with 0, 2, 10, 25, 50 and 100 µM of copper gluconate
respectively. As compared to untreated cells, the number of infected cells was reduced by 71%, 77%, and
78% with 25, 50, and 100 µM of copper gluconate respectively (p < 0.05).
Conclusion: Copper gluconate was found to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells. Furthers studies
are needed to determine whether copper homeostasis could play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

INTRODUCTION

At the end of 2019, the emergence of a novel coronavirus designated as Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a pandemic that threatens human health and public safety
[1,2]. This new virus is highly transmissible and has spread very fast all over the world [1]. Even though the
great majority of people (i.e. around 80%) develop mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19),
a significant proportion of cases are severe or critical and can lead to death [1,3]. So far 1,374,985 people
died from Covid-19 worldwide as of November 22th, 2020 [4]. Thus, there is an urgent need to contain
SARS-CoV-2 spread and virulence with effective curative and preventive treatments [2,3].
During the early phase of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, we have been faced with a strong need for in
vitro models able to test the efficacy of compounds against this virus but only a few laboratories were able
to do so. In silico studies have identified dozens of drugs potentially active against SARS-CoV-2 [5–10].
Despite drug repurposing has been considered as one of the most promising strategies for improving the
care of Covid-19 patients, published data on the in vitro efficacy of molecules potentially active on SARSCoV-2 remain very limited to date [11–14]. Available studies focused mostly on few drugs including

hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, ritonavir, interferon, umifenovir, favipiravir, camostat mesylate,
and immunomodulatory therapies [10–14].
Although some treatments have shown some benefits in patients at later stages of the disease (i.e.
dexamethasone, anticoagulation treatments), there are no acknowledged effective antiviral therapies for
Covid-19 [1]. Recently, preliminary results of the SOLIDARITY trial showed that hydroxychloroquine,
remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon regimens have no significant effect on the mortality rate nor
on the length of hospital stay in COVID-19 patients [15]. Other ongoing clinical trials could provide additional
results shortly [16].
Among the other compounds found to be directly active against SARS-CoV-2, essential minerals
may require special attention. Antimicrobial and antiviral activity of copper is well established [17]. Copper
ions have been found to elicit a broad action against viruses including coronaviruses [18–21]. Recently, it
has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 can be eradicated from a copper surface within 4 hours while it can survive
up to 72 hours on stainless steel and plastic surface [22]. Copper has been proposed to prevent transmission
of the SARS-CoV-2 in the hospital environment (i.e. to cover door handles) or in application to face masks
with the aim of reducing the risk of catching or spreading SARS-CoV-2 [21,23].
In eukaryotes, copper acts as an essential cofactor for more than 30 enzymes involved in redox
reactions including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ceruloplasmin. As well as for other trace metal ions
(e.g. iron, manganese, zinc, selenium, and cobalt), maintenance of an adequate intracellular concentration
of copper is essential to avoid the negative metabolic effects [24,25]. In humans, the normal cupremia
varies from 9.75 to 27.75 µmol/L (650 to 1850 µg/L) in adults [24,26–28] and in tissues copper concentration
fluctuates from 1 to 12 µg/g of tissues [24,28,29]. In human cells, copper is internalized by copper
transporters 1 and 2 and is used for the synthesis of copper-requiring enzymes; it is stored mainly in the
mitochondria and secreted by cells in the bloodstream; excess of copper is mostly eliminated by hepatocyte
in bile [24]. In physiological conditions, copper is bound to ceruloplasmin (accounting for 40-70% of total
plasma copper), albumin, alpha-2 macroglobulin, and other copper-carrying proteins for avoiding
uncontrolled redox activity [24,29].
To the best of our knowledge, no published study to date have evaluated the effect of copper
gluconate using an in vitro cell model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study aimed to assess if pre- and postexposure treatment with copper gluconate could prevent the cells to be infected. For this purpose, we
developed an original confocal microscopy-based high content screening (HCS) method using a
recombinant GFP expressing SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS

Cells lines. Vero E6 and BHK-21 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, ref.
D6429, Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France) supplemented with 2% foetal bovine serum (FBS)

(ref. 10270106, Gibco, ThermoFisher, Courtaboeuf, France) without antibiotic. All cells were maintained at
37°C and in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.
Bacterial and yeast strains. Escherichia coli TransforMax Epi300 electrocompetent cells (Ref. EC300110,
Epicentre, Madison, WI) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae VL6-48N strain [30] were used to propagate the
pCC1BAC-His3 containing viral cDNA. E. coli bacteria were grown in LB broth supplemented with 25 µg/ml
of chloramphenicol. S. cerevisiae yeast were grown on YPD agar supplemented with 25 µg/ml of
chloramphenicol.
Measurement of cell viability. To determine the toxicity of the chemical compound, cells were exposed to
different concentrations of copper gluconate (Copper di-D-gluconate, CAS number 527-09-3, Isaltis, Lyon,
France) ranging from 0 to 1600 µM for 24 hours in DMEM 2% FBS. Cell viability was determined in three
independent experiments with the CyQUANT XTT assay (ref. X12223, Invitrogen, ThermoFisher) following
the manufacturer’s recommendations. Optical densities at 450 and 660 nm were measured using a
microplate reader (Sunrise, Tecan, Lyon, France).
Rescue of synSARS-CoV-2-GFP. The BAC containing viral cDNA of synSARS-CoV-2-GFP clone 6.2 was kindly
provide by Volker Thiel [31]. Upon receipt, BAC was stored in S. cerevisiae VL6-48N. The YAC DNA was
extracted using spin column-based nucleic acid purification (ZR BAC DNA Miniprep Kit, ref. D4049, Zymo
Research, Irvine, CA). The YAC containing viral cDNA was transformed into E. coli TransforMax Epi300 and
amplified flowing manufacturer recommendations. The BAC was extracted from E. coli TransforMax Epi300
using spin column-based nucleic acid purification (ZR BAC DNA Miniprep Kit) and stored at 2-8°C until used
in the next days. The BAC containing viral cDNA was cleaved at a unique restriction site located downstream
of the 3’-end poly(A) tail using NotI-HF (Ref. R3189S, NEB, Grenoble, France). In parallel, the N gene was
amplified from the BAC containing viral cDNA with a high fidelity polymerase (Taq Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity
2x Master Mix, Ref. M0494S, NEB) and primers PV012-F (5’-ACT-GTA-ATA-CGA-CTC-ACT-ATA-GGG-ATGTCT-GAT-AAT-GGA-CCC-CAA-AAT-C-3’) and PV013-R (5’-GGC-CGC-GGC-CGC-TTT-TTT-TTT-TTT-TTT-TTT-TTTTTT-TTT-TAG-GCC-TGA-GTT-GAG-TCA-GC-3’). In vitro transcription of 1-2 µg of phenol-chloroform
extracted and ethanol precipitated DNA resolved in nuclease-free water was carried out using T7 RiboMAX
expression large scale RNA production system (ref. P1300, Promega, Charbonnières-les-Bains, France) with
m7G(5')ppp(5')G RNA Cap Structure Analog (ref. S1404L, Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer.
A similar protocol was used to produce a capped mRNA encoding the N protein. Approximately 10 µg of in
vitro transcribed viral genomic RNA was electroporated together with 2 µg of the N gene transcript into
BHK-21 cells. Briefly, 107 BHK-21 cells were resuspended in 350 µL of ice-cold PBS, mixed with RNA, and
transferred to 0.2 cm electroporation cuvette. Electroporation was carried out with a Genepulser apparatus
(ref. 1652660, Biorad, Marnes-La-Coquette, France) with one pulse of 140V and 25 msec. BHK-21
electroporated cells were immediately co-cultivated with 70-80% confluent Vero E6 cells in wells of 9.5 cm2.
After an incubation of cells for 5 days, the cell supernatant was collected and cellular residues were
removed by centrifugation at 3000g for 20 min. Clarified supernatant (passage 0) was stored and used to

produce virus stocks for further analysis. All work involving the culture, production, and storage of SARSCoV-2-GFP was performed in a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory.
Confocal microscopy-based high content screening. Copper gluconate was dissolved in sterile water and
filter-sterilized with a 0.22 µm PVDF filter. The stock solution at 10 mM was stored at 2-8°C for a maximum
of 10 days. Vero E6 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (ref. CLS3904, Corning, Sigma Aldrich) at a density
of 20,000 cells per well. Cells were incubated for 18 hours at 37°C and in 5% CO2. The next day, cells were
treated with copper gluconate concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 µM for 18 hours before infection with
GFP expressing SARS-CoV-2. The medium was removed and cells were infected with GFP expressing SARSCoV-2 at a m.o.i. of 0.005 for 1 hour. After the adsorption step, the medium was removed and cells were
incubated in fresh medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% of FBS) supplemented with copper gluconate
concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 µM at 37°C and in 5% CO2 for another 48 hour-period. Nuclei of Vero
E6 cells were stained with 4 µg/ml Hoechst 33342 (ref. H1399, Invitrogen) for 30 min. Ninety-six-well plates
were sealed in the BSL3 laboratory to be imaged by confocal microscopy at 40-fold-magnification (Ti2 CSUW1 SoRA, Nikon, France). Three independent experiments were performed and z-stack images were
acquired in 12 random fields in duplicate wells (i.e. 6 fields per well) for each experimental condition. The
whole process of acquisition was fully automated using in house pipeline developed with the JOBS module
of the NIS software. Images were analysed using NIS general analysis 3 in-house pipeline (NIS software
v5.30, Nikon) to count the total number of nuclei, the number of nuclei in the infected area, the volume of
the infected area, and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of infected cells.
Statistics and software. SnapGene software v5.2 (GSL Biotech, San Diego, CA) was used to determine in
silico the restriction profiles of BAC/YAC containing viral cDNA of synSARS-CoV-2-GFP clone 6.2. Statistical
analysis and graphics were computed with GraphPad software v9 (Prism, San Diego, CA). The improvement
of the images for publishing was performed with Fiji software (v1.53c).

RESULTS

Cell toxicity of copper gluconate. Vero E6 cells were treated with gluconate copper concentrations ranging
from 0 to 1600 µM for 24 hours. Cell viability was determined by measuring the reduction of XTT converted
to orange-coloured formazan product using the CyQUANT XTT assay. The viability of Vero E6 treated with
copper gluconate up to 200 µM was similar to that of untreated cells. However, the cell viability dropped
below 40% at 400 µM and reached a value close to zero for a concentration of 800 µM (Figure 1).

calculated by dividing the signal of treated cells by the signal of untreated cells. Dots represent the value of
each independent experiment, which correspond to the mean value of duplicate wells. Bars represent the
mean value of three independent experiments. Error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean.

Antiviral activity of copper gluconate. Vero E6 cells were treated with concentrations of copper gluconate
ranging from 0 to 100 µM at 18 hours before SARS-CoV-2-GFP infection. The treatment was removed during
the 1 hour of the adsorption of recombinant SARS-CoV-2-GFP viruses. After absorption, the medium was
replaced by fresh culture media supplemented with the same concentrations of copper gluconate and cells
were incubated for another 48 hour-period to let viruses infect and replicate in cells. Then, the level of
infection was measured by confocal microscopy. Results of three independent experiments are depicted in
Figure 2. The rate of infection was significantly lower in cells treated with a concentration of copper
gluconate of 25 µM and higher as compared to untreated cells (Figure 2a). The rate of infection was 23.8%,
18.9%, 20.6%, 6.9%, 5.3%,5.2% in cells supplemented with 0, 2, 10, 25, 50 and 100 µM of copper gluconate
respectively. Thus, the number of infected cells was reduced by 71, 77, and 78% with 25, 50, and 100 µM
of copper gluconate respectively (p < 0.05). The cumulative number of cells analysed in three independent
experiments represents roughly 5000 cells per condition tested in each independent experiment (Figure
2b). The number of infected cells was significantly lower in cells that were pre-treated with a concentration
of copper gluconate of 25 µM and higher as compared to untreated cells (Figure 2b). The volume filled by
infected cells was determined by measuring the volume filled by GFP-positive voxels for each independent
experiment. Again, the concentration of copper gluconate of 25 µM was the lowest dose tested that
significantly reduced the viral infection as compared to untreated cells (Figure 2c). Together, these results
suggest that copper gluconate mitigate the infection of Vero E6 cells. Additionally, linear regression analysis
showed that the MFI of infected cells decreased with the concentration of copper gluconate used to treat
the cells (p < 0.01, linear regression) (Figure 2d). These latter results suggest that copper gluconate might
also limit the viral replication inside Vero E6 cells.

DISCUSSION

For this study, we developed an original confocal microscopy-based HCS using an in vitro model
with Vero E6 cells challenged with a recombinant GFP expressing SARS-CoV-2 that was reconstructed using
a yeast-based reverse genetics platform [31]. This method has the advantage of being able to analyse each
cell individually and to count thousands of cells per well at the same time to increase the reliability of the
observations. By using both a motorized stage and a fully automated pipeline for image recording, we
virtually eliminated any possible bias that could be linked to the person in charge of image acquisition. The
quantitative analysis of images was also fully automated by using an in-house pipeline developed with a
plugin of the NIS software to avoid technical bias. A similar experimental setup with Vero E6 cells and the
same GFP expressing SARS-CoV-2 clone was found to be suitable for drug screening applications by using
the antiviral remdesivir as a reference [31]. Thus, we decided to combine this in vitro model of GFP
expressing SARS-CoV-2 infection with confocal microscopy-based HCS to assess the antiviral activity of
copper gluconate. Furthers improvements of this technology (e.g. using cell lines with fluorescents
reporters) could help to study more easily whether and how drugs or chemical compounds could counteract
SARS-CoV-2 infection in mammalian cells.
In the present study, the combination of pre- and post-exposure treatment of Vero E6 cells with 25
to 100 µM of copper gluconate led to a 70% reduction of the cell infection rate. Copper gluconate
concentrations of 25 µM and higher were also effective in reducing the number of infected cells and the
volume filled by infected cells as compared to the untreated condition. However, none of the tested copper
gluconate concentrations, up to 100 µM, was able to completely inhibit the infection. Although

concentrations up to 200 µM showed no significant toxicity to Vero E6 cells, we did not use concentrations
higher than 100 µM. In humans, the concentration of copper in whole blood is approximately 15 µM (1000
µg/L) but this value can fluctuate widely according to various factors [24,26–29]. In tissue, the copper
concentration is about 1 to 12 µg/g, which is 1000-fold lower than the serum concentration [28,29]. It must
be acknowledged that the effect we observed with 25 µM of copper gluconate is not as powerful as that
described with antiviral drugs [32] but this concentration is reasonably close to the normal cupremia. The
fact that a physiological concentration of copper was not able to abolish the viral infection is not so
surprising if we consider the fact that copper is a ubiquitous trace element present in all eukaryotes. Even
if copper seems to act against the virus by decreasing the number of infected cells, the antiviral effect
observed is probably multifactorial in Vero E6 cells and certainly much more complex in vivo.
Warnes et al. showed that copper ions can damage virus membranes and destroy the viral genome of
human coronavirus 229E [33]. In our study, a direct effect of copper cannot be excluded because copper
gluconate was maintained in the culture medium as long as the infection lasted.
We also observed that the increase of copper gluconate concentration up to 100 µM is associated with a
statistically significant decrease of MFI. Because GFP expressed by the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 is fused to
the non-structural protein 7, we can speculate that copper might limit the synthesis of viral proteins. This
hypothesis is supported by in silico studies predicting that metal ions such as cobalt(III) or copper(II) could
inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease [34,35]. However, found only two in vitro studies corroborating that
copper ions could inhibit the synthesis of viral proteins or the replication cycle [36,37]. Thus, further in vitro
experiments are needed to understand whether copper ions may limit the synthesis of viral proteins in
mammalian cells.
Copper could also act against viruses by upregulating the Cu/Zn SOD1 expression. In vitro studies showed
that an increase of SOD1 expression is associated with a decrease in viral replication [38,39]. Last, it was
well established that the coronavirus replication complex requires autophagy-associated cellular
components [40]. Because copper is known to be able to modulate autophagy, copper induced-autophagy
could limit the availability of autophagy associated cellular components that are required for viral
replication [19].
Whether one of these mechanisms more than another could be involved in the antiviral effect observed in
our study remains unclear. Most proteins involved in copper homeostasis have not been studied extensively
including ceruloplasmin and albumin, which have been the most researched [29]. Cuproenzymes such as
ceruloplasmin or superoxide dismutase incorporate copper via the secretory pathway and they can be
found in practically every location inside and out of the cell [41]. Further studies are needed to investigate
whether the copper gluconate supplementation in culture media increases the internalization of copper
and whether intracellular copper is required to struggle against viral infection.
In humans, a retrospective observational study showed that zinc and selenium transporter
selenoprotein P and zinc deficiency was associated with the worst outcomes in elderly Covid-19 patients

[42]. A meta-analysis in Chinese children reported that copper deficiency is associated with recurrent
respiratory tract infection [43]. However, the knowledge about the pharmacokinetics of metal ions during
the acute phase of viral infection is still limited [25] and whether copper homeostasis could play a role
during SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Thus, it could be interesting to determine copper concentrations
in serum but also tissues such as nails and hairs in asymptomatic, mild, and severe Covid-19 patients. The
animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection that have been developed worldwide [44] seems the most
appropriate approach to unravel the role of copper homeostasis during SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo.
In conclusion, our findings showed that copper gluconate supplementation could reduce SARS-CoV2 infection in vitro. Furthers studies are needed to determine whether copper homeostasis could play a role
in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
