ABSTRACT
The lack of coronavirus-specific antiviral drugs has instigated multiple drug repurposing studies
to redirect previously approved medicines for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus
behind the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. A recent, large-scale, retrospective clinical study
showed that famotidine, when administered at a high dose to hospitalized COVID-19 patients,
reduced the rates of intubation and mortality. A separate, patient-reported study associated
famotidine use with improvements in mild to moderate symptoms such as cough and shortness of
breath. While a prospective, multi-center clinical study is ongoing, two parallel in silico studies
have proposed one of the two SARS-CoV-2 proteases, 3CLpro or PLpro, as potential molecular
targets of famotidine activity; however, this remains to be experimentally validated. In this
report, we systematically analyzed the effect of famotidine on viral proteases and virus
replication. Leveraging a series of biophysical and enzymatic assays, we show that famotidine
neither binds with nor inhibits the functions of 3CLpro and PLpro. Similarly, no direct antiviral
activity of famotidine was observed at concentrations of up to 200 µM, when tested against
SARS-CoV-2 in two different cell lines, including a human cell line originating from lungs, a
primary target of COVID-19. These results rule out famotidine as a direct-acting inhibitor of
SARS-CoV-2 replication and warrant further investigation of its molecular mechanism of action
in the context of COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION
A large part of the current therapeutic discovery effort against the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV)-2 is focused on drug repurposing1. Of such agents, only
remdesivir has thus far shown clinical evidence of antiviral effect2, while several others have not
met their primary endpoints in various clinical studies3,4. Recently, famotidine has gained
attention as a therapeutic option against SARS-CoV-2, initially based on anecdotal evidence of
its positive effects in COVID-19 patients in China. Famotidine (PEPCID®), a histamine-2
receptor (H2R) antagonist, is an FDA approved drug for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux
disease (GERD) and gastric ulcers5.
Earlier reports of the beneficial effect of famotidine in China were recently supported by
a retrospective clinical study involving 1620 patients in the U.S., which noted that hospitalized
COVID-19 patients receiving a total median dose of 136 mg famotidine, in oral or IV
formulation once daily, for 6 days had a reduced risk of death or intubation6. Another study
involving 10 non-hospitalized patients linked the use of high-dose oral famotidine (240 mg per
day for a median of 11 days) with patient-reported improvements in symptoms such as shortness
of breath and cough7. These two reports conclude that the use of high-dose famotidine may be
associated with improvements in both mild and severe symptoms of COVID-19. While a large,
multi-center clinical trial to confirm these observations is in progress, the mechanism by which
famotidine purportedly improves the clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients is unknown. In
silico modeling and molecular docking studies have separately suggested either of the two
SARS-CoV-2 proteases as potential targets of famotidine activity8,9. In one computational study,
Wu et. al. docked a library of approved drugs on to the available X-ray crystal structure of the 3chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2, identifying famotidine as one of the drugs

likely to act on the protease

. Other computational reports have predicted famotidine as an

inhibitor of the Papain-like protease (PLpro), a second SARS-CoV-2 protease9. Together, these
studies have raised the prospect of a direct antiviral effect of famotidine on SARS-CoV-2
replication. While both proteins are attractive targets for SARS-CoV-2 drug development10-19,
there are at present no clinical-stage or approved drugs targeting either protein. The possibility of
famotidine, an approved drug, acting on SARS-CoV-2 proteases is of significant clinical interest.
In this study, we performed an array of biochemical, biophysical, and antiviral experiments to
test if famotidine is an effector of SARS-CoV-2 proteases and whether it inhibits virus
replication in cultured cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Compounds
Famotidine was acquired from Sigma Aldrich (Missouri, USA; cat. No. F6889). Compound 6, a
previously reported inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro function20 was acquired from MedChem
Express, Inc. (New Jersey, USA; cat no. HY-17542). ML188, a compound with known 3CLpro
inhibitory activity15 was also acquired from MedChem Express, Inc. (cat. no HY-136259).
Similarly, remdesivir. (cat. No HY-104077) an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication2 was
purchased from the same vendor. All compounds were dissolved in 100% DMSO at 100mM.

Cloning, expression, and protein purification
The complete sequences encoding 3CLpro and residues 746-1060 of PLpro (Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate,
GenBank accession NC_045512) were cloned into a charge modified SUMO fusion expression
vector, generated in-house. The fusion protein was expressed for 24 hours in Rosetta-2 (DE3)
pLysS at 18°C in ZYP-5052 autoinducing media. Harvested cells were resuspended in 50 mM

Hepes pH 7.5, containing 150 mM NaCl and lysed by sonication. The clarified supernatant was
loaded onto a HiTrap HP SP column (Cytiva, Massachusetts, USA; cat no. 17115201) and the
target fusion protein was captured in a cation-exchange chromatography step and eluted using a
NaCl gradient. SUMO hydrolase was added to the pooled fractions to liberate the target protein
and the sample dialyzed against 20 mM Tris, 10 % v/v glycerol, 5 mM DTT pH 7.0 overnight at
4°C. The protein was reloaded on the HiTrap HP SP column to remove the SUMO protein and
hydrolase in a subtractive step. The flow-through, containing 3CLpro or PLpro was further purified
by anion exchange chromatography using a HiTrap HP Q column (Cytiva; cat. no. 17115401)
employing a NaCl gradient to elute the protein. Pooled fractions were further purified by size
exclusion chromatography in 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl and 5 mM DTT. The final
protein was concentrated to 4 mg/mL for PLpro and 5 mg/mL for 3CLpro and flash frozen in
aliquots.

In-vitro viral enzyme assays
PLpro proteolytic activity assay using ubiquitin-AMC: PLpro activity was measured in a 384 well
plate format (Corning #3574) in a kinetic assay using the fluorogenic substrate Ubiquitin-AMC
(Boston Biochem, Inc. Massachusetts, USA; cat. No. U-550) with excitation and emission
wavelengths of Ex355nm/Em:460nm. The protocol followed previously reported conditions with
minor modifications13,16. Fluorescence was monitored at 25 oC, every 5 min for 50 min in a
Victor X5 (Perkin Elmer) multimode plate reader. Optimal enzyme and substrate concentrations
were found to be 550 nM PLpro titrating the substrate in the range of 0.2 – 3 μM. The assay
buffer (20 μL) contained 25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 550 nM
PLpro. The test inhibitor, famotidine and the PLpro control inhibitor (compound 6) were both
titrated in the concentration range of 0.01 μM – 200 μM. Compounds were incubated with the

enzyme in the plate for 30 minutes at 25°C before the reaction was started by the addition of 1

μM Ub-AMC. All samples were run in triplicates and their initial slopes were converted from
relative fluorescence units (RFU)/ min to μmol AMC/min using an AMC standard curve and
plotted against compound concentrations tested.
3CLpro proteolytic activity assay: 3CLpro activity was assayed in a 384 well plate using the 3CLpro
FRET substrate (AnaSpec, Inc. California, USA; cat. no. AS-65599) with excitation and
emission wavelengths of Ex: 490nm/Em: 535 nm. A previously reported protocol was used with
some modifications12,17. The kinetics of fluorescence change were monitored every minute for 25
min. Optimal concentrations for 3CLpro and substrate were 150 nM and 600 nM respectively. A
previously reported 3CLpro inhibitor14, ML188, was used as a positive control for inhibition, both
control and test compounds were titrated in the concentration range of 0.01 μM – 200 μM. Initial
slopes of RFU/min were converted to μM hydrolyzed substrate/ min using a standard curve of
HiLyte Fluor488 amine, TFA salt.
Biochemical Data Analysis: After subtraction of background fluorescence readings, values of
Km and EC50 were obtained by fitting the experimental data with the Michaelis-Menten
(y=(Vmax*x)/(Km+x)) and the four parameters logistic (4PL) equations (y= min + (maxmin)/(1+(x/EC50)^Hillslope)) respectively, using GraphPad Prism 8.

Dynamic Scanning Fluorimetry:
Thermal unfolding of proteins was monitored in a 20 uL volume in Micro-Amp EnduraPlate
Optical 384-well Clear Reaction Plates (ThermoFisher: cat no. 4483285 ). Reactions contained
50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 62.5 mM NaCl, 7 μM 3CLpro or PLpro, 5% DMSO, and 4x SYPROorange protein gel stain (ThermoFisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA; cat no. S6651).

respectively, were incubated with the protein for 15 minutes before the addition of SYPRO
orange. Plates were covered with Micro-Amp Optical Adhesive Film (ThermoFisher Scientific,
Massachusetts, USA; cat no. 4360954) and run on Applied Biosystems 7900HT (California,
USA) real time PCR instrument. Samples were incubated at 25°C for 2 min followed by an
increase in temperature of 1°C/min up to 95°C. Fluorescence was monitored continuously. Each
sample was run in triplicate and compounds were tested at 1 mM, 2.5 mM, and 5 mM. The
melting temperature (Tm) was obtained from the first derivative of the raw thermal denaturing
data were determined and smoothed to calculate melting temperature (Tm) values 21.

Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR):
SPR studies were performed on a Biacore 3000 instrument (Cytiva, Massachusetts, USA) at 10
o

C. The PLpro and 3CLpro proteins were biotinylated by minimal biotinylation approach with the

EZ-LINK Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA; cat
no. A35358) and immobilized on a neutravidin coated CM5 sensor chip to a level of 4000
response units (RU). The protein used during immobilization was at 1 μM for PLpro and 1μM for
3CLpro. During the course of the assay different concentrations of compounds were injected. The
Compounds were serially diluted (2-fold) in a running buffer of 25 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 200 mM
NaCl, 2 mM TCEP, 0.005% P20 and 1% DMSO. Famotidine, and the control inhibitors,
compound 6 and the ML188 were tested up to a maximal dose of 100 μM, 50 μM and 5μM,
respectively. The final response was obtained by subtracting the blank channel (without protein)
and a buffer injection across the sample channel. Raw data were analyzed in the Scrubber2
program (BioLogic Software) by fitting the data to a simple 1:1 equilibrium and kinetic model.
Antiviral assays:

Viruses and titration: Virus infectivity assays were carried out using the 2019-nCoV/USAWA1/2020 isolate of SARS-CoV-2 (NCBI accession number: MN985325), obtained from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and BEI Resources (Virginia, USA). The virus stock
was propagated in Vero E6 cells and virus titers determined using plaque formation assays, as
described previously22.
Antiviral assays: Human lung A549 cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 entry factors and African
Green Monkey kidney Vero E6 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS). The cells were seeded into poly-L-lysine-coated 96-well plates at a density
of 15,000 cells per well. The cells were then treated for 4h with five-fold serial dilutions of
famotidine, ranging between 0.32 µM and 200 µM. DMSO served as a negative control, while 5fold serial dilutions of remdesivir, ranging between 0.1 µM and 62.5 µM, served as a positive
control. The cells were then infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of
0.1. To infect cells, the compound-containing medium was removed, and the cells were
incubated with the virus for 1h at 37ºC. The virus inoculum was then removed, and the cell
monolayer was rinsed twice with 1X PBS. The compounds were added back followed by
incubation for 72h, after which the cell culture medium was harvested for quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR) and plaque assays, while the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for
immunofluorescence microscopy.
Virus RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR): RNA was isolated from the
cell culture supernatant of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells using the Quick-RNA Viral Kit (Zymo,
California, USA cat no. R1035) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Viral RNA was
quantified using single-step RT-quantitative real-time PCR using the qScript One-Step RT-qPCR
Kit (Quantabio, Massachusetts, USA; cat no. 95058) with primers and Taqman probes targeting

the SARS-CoV-2 E gene as previously described23. Data were acquired using a Quantstudio3
Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using the following conditions: 55°C for 10 min,
denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, 45 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 15 sec, and annealing at
58°C for 30 sec. The primers and probe used were as follow: E_Sarbeco_Forward:

ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACACA. For absolute quantification of viral RNA, a 389 bp
fragment from the SARS-CoV-2 E gene was cloned onto pIDTBlue plasmid under an SP6
promoter using NEB PCR cloning kit (New England Biosciences, Massachusetts, USA; cat no.
E1202S). The cloned fragment was then in vitro transcribed using the mMessage mMachine SP6
transcription kit (ThermoFisher, Massachusetts, USA; cat no. AM1340) to generate the qRTPCR standard.
Immunofluorescence microscopy: Virus-infected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for
30 minutes. The fixative was removed, and the cell monolayer washed twice with 1X PBS. The
cells were then permeabilized and stained with an anti-SARS-CoV Nucleocapsid (N) antibody
(Rockland Inc., Pennsylvania, USA; cat. no. 200-401-A50; 1:2,000 dilution). Incubation with the
primary antibody was performed overnight at 4ºC. The cells were then washed 5 times with 1X
PBS and stained with Alexa 568-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000 dilution) in the dark at
room temperature for 1h and counterstained with DAPI. Images were captured using EVOS
M5000 Imaging System (ThermoFisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA). Quantitation and
analysis of the fixed cell images was carried out using the MuviCyte Live-Cell Imaging System
(PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA). At least 7-10 microscopic fields were imaged per well
using a 10X objective lens, the number of cells positive for the SARS-CoV-2 N protein and the

expressing the viral N protein were calculated, and the mean±SD of multiple images for each
condition was plotted.
Cytotoxicity/Cell viability assay: The CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega,
Wisconsin, USA; cat no. G7570) was used to determine the cytotoxic effects of the compounds.
Briefly, the cells were incubated with five-fold serial dilutions of famotidine or remdesivir for
72h, after which the CellTiter-Glo Reagent was added to each well in a volume equal to the
volume of the culture medium. The contents were mixed by shaking the plate on an orbital
shaker for 2 min, followed by a 10 min incubation at room temperature. Luminescence was
recorded using a Varioskan LUX multimode plate reader (ThermoFisher Scientific,
Massachusetts, USA).
RESULTS
Famotidine is not an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 proteases
Processing of the SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein is critical to the generation of a functional virus
replication complex11,18,24. To carry out this essential proteolytic function, the SARS-CoV-2
genome encodes two cysteine proteases, called PLpro and 3CLpro18. Due to their critical roles in
viral polyprotein processing and virus proliferation, both proteases are considered attractive
targets for drug discovery10,11,13-17,20. Since in silico docking studies have predicted these
proteases as putative molecular targets of famotidine6,8,9, we methodically investigated the effect
of famotidine on the catalytic functions of each protease.
First, we developed an in vitro activity assay of PLpro. PLpro is a protease domain found
within the large multi-domain nsp3 protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2. While many
coronaviruses encode two papain-like proteases, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

possess only one PLpro, which processes the amino-terminal end of the viral polyprotein
liberating nsp1, nsp2 and nsp3

19,20

. Additionally, PLpro deubiquitinates host cell proteins by

cleaving the consensus motif of LXGG18,19 and is known to efficiently hydrolyze both
diubiquitin and synthetic peptide substrates19. We leveraged the deubiquitinating property of
PLpro to set up a functional activity assay using ubiquitin-AMC, a fluorogenic substrate cleavable
by PLpro. Upon incubation with PLpro, the ubiquitin is recognized and cleaved at the C-terminus
to liberate the AMC (amido-4-methylcoumarin) fluorophore which results in increased
fluorescence that is read using excitation and emission wavelengths of 355/460 nm. We assessed
the ability of famotidine to inhibit the proteolytic activity of PLpro at a broad range of drug
concentrations vis-à-vis compound 6, a previously reported inhibitor of PLpro activity20.
Experimental conditions including protein and substrate concentrations, buffer composition, and
assay kinetics were optimized using compound 6. While compound 6 inhibited PLpro activity
with the expected low single-digit μM IC50 values, famotidine showed no reduction in PLpro
activity in the titrated range of 0.01-200 μM (Figure 1A).
We next tested whether famotidine can inhibit the enzymatic activity of 3CLpro, the
second protease encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome. This protein, also referred to as the main
protease (Mpro) or nsp5, cleaves the viral polyprotein at 11 unique sites11. This proteolytic
activity generates multiple individual functional proteins required for the assembly of the SARSCoV-2 replication/transcription complex, which drives viral genome replication24. Owing to its
central role in the coronavirus life cycle, 3CLpro has received significant attention as a drug target
resulting in the discovery of several potent inhibitors

10,14,15,17

. Native 3CLpro exists as a

homodimer and requires dimerization for its proteolytic activity11. The catalytic mechanism of
3CLpro activity is typical of cysteine proteases, where the Cys-His catalytic dyad drives site-

specific cleavage of substrates. We evaluated the enzymatic activity of 3CLpro using a FRETpeptide substrate that quenched fluorescence in its intact form, however, cleavage of the peptide
substrate by 3CLpro produced fluorescence that could be measured at the excitation/emission
wavelengths of 490/535 nm. The inclusion of ML188, a previously reported 3CLpro inhibitor
served as a control, also aiding assay setup and optimization. Results of the FRET assay for
various ML188 and famotidine concentrations are shown in Figure 1B. Both drug compounds
were tested between a range of 0.01-200

μM.

While ML188 produced a dose-dependent

inhibition of 3CLpro activity with an expected IC50 of 2.4 μM, famotidine did not inhibit 3CLpro
activity. These two experiments indicate that famotidine does not interfere with the catalytic
activity of either of the two SARS-CoV-2 proteases.
Famotidine does not directly engage PLpro or 3CLpro of SARS-CoV-2
The function of many enzymes, such as proteases and kinases, can extend beyond their catalytic
roles and includes a wide spectrum of non-catalytic activities such as allosteric regulation,
scaffolding, protein-protein interactions, and protein-DNA interactions25. To rule out whether
famotidine could bind away from the active site of the two viral proteases, and exert an effect
through interference with non-proteolytic functions, we asked if famotidine is able to bind
directly with either of the two SARS-CoV-2 proteases. For this, we employed two distinct
biophysical techniques i.e. surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and differential scanning
fluorimetry (DSF), that are routinely used to probe drug-protein engagement.
For our SPR studies, the biotinylated viral proteases were captured to a high density on
sensor chips via neutravidin, permitting real-time detection of small-molecule binding to the
target viral proteases. Engagement of the small-molecule compounds was recorded as an
increase in dose-dependent response units (RU) during the assay. Experimental conditions

including buffer composition and temperature were optimized using the control compounds prior
to conducting the famotidine studies. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) values were
determined using both a kinetic analysis and fit to a binding isotherm of the dose response data
(Figure 2). The observed Kd values for the known 3CLpro and PLpro inhibitors (Supplementary
Information Table S1) were consistent with the published IC50 data14,20 indicating the robustness
of our assay methodology. Under these optimized conditions, famotidine was not found to
interact with either of the two viral proteases at concentration ranges of up to 100 uM.
To validate the results obtained from our SPR analysis, we employed an orthogonal DSF
assay. DSF is a fluorescence-monitored thermal denaturing technique in which the melting
temperature (Tm) of a protein is tracked via fluorescence as the sample temperature is
incrementally raised in the presence of a hydrophobic dye. Drug binding to its target protein is
known to stabilize (or destabilize) protein structure resulting in a variation of Tm profiles in the
absence or presence of a drug. DSF provides definitive confirmation of target engagement as the
increase in thermal unfolding temperature (ΔTm) is only achieved when the compounds bind to
the folded state of the protein. The ΔTm is proportional to the Kd of the interaction and
concentration of the compound. We tested the ability of famotidine and the control inhibitors to
alter the thermal stability profiles of PLpro and 3CLpro. An optimal signal profile was obtained
with 7μM PLpro or 3CLpro. Both proteins were tested separately in the presence of DMSO (-ve
control), their respective control inhibitors, and famotidine at concentrations of 1, 2.5 and 5mM.
In agreement with the SPR data, the control inhibitors produced a quantitative increase in
observed Tm (Figure 3). While compound 6, the known PLpro inhibitor, stabilized PLpro by a Tm

biophysical data decisively rules out the possibility of famotidine exerting its effect on PLpro or
3CLpro through interference with catalytic or non-catalytic protein functions as it is unable to
bind with either of the two proteases.
Famotidine does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in cultured cells
Having established that famotidine does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 proteases, we investigated the
ability of famotidine to block virus replication in cell culture. For this, we infected Vero E6 cells,
a commonly used cell model of SARS-CoV-2 infection derived from the African green monkey
kidney. Infection efficiency was quantified through multiple, orthogonal readouts, including
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), plaque formation, and immunofluorescence. Remdesivir
inhibited viral replication with an estimated half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) value
of 3.3 μM, as determined by immunofluorescence (Figure 4A). In contrast, famotidine did not
produce any measurable inhibition at concentrations of up to 200 μM at 72h post infection.
Similar results were obtained when viral replication was examined by infectious virion
production using plaque formation assays or by quantifying viral RNA copy numbers in the cell
culture medium using qRT-PCR (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2).
To confirm these results in a more physiologically relevant cell model of SARS-CoV-2
infection, we assessed the antiviral activity of famotidine in human lung A549 cells. These cells
were engineered to express essential SARS-CoV-2 entry factors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. The
cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and cultured in the absence or presence of the control or
test compounds. Virus replication (infection) efficiency was measured and reported as a function
of compound concentration (Figure 4). While remdesivir strongly inhibited virus replication in a
dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 0.43 µM, famotidine had no measurable effect

(Figure 4B). Our results are consistent with previously reported studies in which remdesivir
exerted a greater antiviral effect in human lung A549 cells than in Vero E6 cells 26.
In-parallel cytotoxicity assays, carried out in both Vero E6 and A549 cells, showed that
famotidine was not toxic up to the highest tested concentrations of 200 μM (Figure 4 A and B).
Remdesivir, on the other hand, exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity at higher concentrations,
well above its IC50. Together, these results show that famotidine does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2
replication in cultured cells and that its purported clinical benefit may be due to an alternative
mechanism of action.
DISCUSSION
Two in silico studies have separately predicted the 3CLpro or PLpro of SARS-CoV-2 as potential
molecular targets of famotidine8,9, implying that famotidine associated improvement in COVID19 patients may be due to a direct antiviral mechanism of action6. Despite recent advances in
computational techniques, there are several challenges associated with the use of molecular
docking to predict protein-ligand interactions accurately. Some of these challenges arise from the
flexibility of the target protein, lack of prior knowledge of drug-binding sites, and protonation
states of target amino acids27. While results obtained from molecular docking can serve as a basis
for new hypotheses, experimental validation is needed. Our ligand-binding experiments using
SPR and DSF did not support previous in silico predictions of direct binding between famotidine
and SARS-CoV-2 proteases. We further used an array of experimental approaches to show that
famotidine had no effect on SARS-CoV-2 protease function or generally on viral replication. It
must be noted that since the clinical studies correlated putative clinical benefit with the use of
higher doses of famotidine, we tested famotidine at significantly higher in vitro concentrations
than the peak plasma concentrations (0.5–2µM) achieved in the blood of patients in both clinical

studies 6,7. Our data strongly suggest that the probable clinical benefit of famotidine likely arises
independently of an antiviral mechanism of action.
COVID-19 complications are associated with a severe pro-inflammatory response in the
lungs of infected patients28. The “cytokine storm” as a result of inflammation is a key
pathognomonic feature of COVID-19 and the main contributor to respiratory failure and
mortality29. Severe COVID-19 cases are characterized by pulmonary infiltration and extensive
pulmonary edema, causing exudation of inflammatory cells in the alveolar space, resulting in
extensive pulmonary consolidation leading to pneumonia and adult respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS)30-33. The results of the two famotidine-related COVID-19 clinical reports, when taken
together

6,7

, suggest that famotidine likely helps with mitigating moderate to severe respiratory

symptoms ranging from shortness of breath to intubation. Our data does not rule out the
possibility that famotidine related improvements in COVID-19 patients are through an antiinflammatory action. For example, the development of the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients
is characterized by elevation of pro-inflammatory type I cytokines, which are secreted from a
variety of cells such as polymorphonuclear cells, natural killer cells, and endothelial cells, etc29.
It is therefore conceivable that famotidine-related benefit in managing respiratory symptoms may
be due to an anti-inflammatory mechanism of action.
It is noteworthy that H2R, the established molecular target of famotidine, is involved in
the activation of several mediators of the adaptive immune response, such as Th1 lymphocytes,
which are implicated in pro-inflammatory cytokine production34. Histamine, the H2R ligand,
also regulates bronchoconstriction, airway inflammation, and vasodilation34. Mast cells are a
major source of histamine and their activation has been reported following viral infections of the
respiratory tract35-37. Therefore, Mast cells may represent an underappreciated source of pro-

inflammatory cytokine release in COVID-19 patients35. A better understanding of the role of the
H2R pathway in COVID-19 will help elucidate the molecular details of how famotidine reduces
the disease severity.
Our study redirects the mechanism behind the potential beneficial effect of famotidine,
away from an antiviral effect to likely an anti-inflammatory action in COVID-19 patients. Given
that there is an ongoing randomized clinical trial (NCT04370262), our results may assist the
investigators in reshaping their interventional study to include inflammation-related outcomes.
Also, it should be noted that while famotidine is one of the relatively safer drugs, its use is not
without risk38-40, especially in elderly patients (a high-risk population for COVID-19), in which
famotidine use has been associated with CNS complications41. Provided the ongoing clinical trial
yields promising results, further investigation of famotidine and its safety profile in different age
brackets will be needed before the drug can be used, most likely as part of a combination
therapy, for COVID-19 disease management.
