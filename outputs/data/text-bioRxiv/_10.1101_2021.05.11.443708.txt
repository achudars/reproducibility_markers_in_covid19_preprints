ABSTRACT
Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has produced a number of structural
models of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, already prompting biomedical outcomes.
However, these reported models and their associated electrostatic potential
maps represent an unknown admixture of conformations stemming from the
underlying energy landscape of the spike protein. As for any protein, some of
the spike’s conformational motions are expected to be biophysically relevant,
but cannot be interpreted only by static models. Using experimental cryo-EM
images, we present the energy landscape of the spike protein conformations,
and identify molecular rearrangements along the most-likely conformational
path in the vicinity of the open (so called 1RBD-up) state. The resulting global
and local atomic refinements reveal larger movements than those expected
by comparing the reported 1RBD-up and 1RBD-down cryo-EM models. Here
we report greater degrees of “openness” in global conformations of the
1RBD-up state, not revealed in the single-model interpretations of the
density maps, together with conformations that overlap with the reported
models. We discover how the glycan shield contributes to the stability of
these conformations along the minimum free-energy pathway. A local
analysis of seven key binding pockets reveals that six out them, including

those for engaging ACE2, therapeutic mini-proteins, linoleic acid, two
different kinds of antibodies, and protein-glycan interaction sites, switch
conformations between their known apo- and holo-conformations, even
when the global spike conformation is 1RBD-up. This is reminiscent of a
conformational pre-equilibrium. We found only one binding pocket, namely
antibody AB-C135 to remain closed along the entire minimum free energy
path, suggesting an induced fit mechanism for this enzyme.

Introduction
Intensive research, primarily by cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) techniques, has
established that the spike protein plays a critical role in the process of infection by the SARSCOVID family (1,2). The average ’apo’ (ligand-free) and ’holo’ (ligand-bound) conformations
assumed by the spike protein are now known to near-atomic resolution (1,3,4). It is recognized
that the spike protein exhibits structural variability (1, 5). However, access to an
experimentally determined conformational path between the apo- and holo-end states would
substantially elucidate the thermally accessible functionally relevant conformational motions
of the spike protein (6,7).
As different molecular conformations populate different energy states, their
conformational spectrum defines an energy landscape. This landscape is, in principle, multidimensional. Nonetheless, a two-dimensional (2D) representation described by the leading
two conformational coordinates is commonly used to project the multidimensional free
energy profiles on to a manifold of reduced dimensionality (6–8). Near equilibrium,
biomolecular function corresponds to traversing the minimum-energy pathway connecting
the initial and final states (9–13). For example, the path underlying cell recognition of the spike
protein commences along the energy landscape of the apo state transitions to the holo state
after binding the cell surface receptors, ending at the most probable conformations on the
holo landscape. Here, we focus on the apo segment of the spike conformational pathway and
draw inferences on its plausible binding mechanisms not amenable to a single-structure
representation, or even microsecond-long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of apo-state
models.
The Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the apo spike protein exists primarily in two
conformations. These “down” and “up” states occur with nearly equal probability (1, 3). In the
down state, the ACE2 binding pocket is obscured, rendering membrane fusion essentially
unfeasible. The nature of the pathway between the down and the up states of the RBD, and
the transition rate between a hidden and an accessible ACE2 binding pocket are of central
importance for understanding SARS-CoV2’s ability to hide vulnerable epitopes from the host’s
immune system (2). Several studies have employed Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to

investigate the transitions between these states, using static cryo-EM structures to
characterize each endpoint (14–19). However, a single cryo-EM map often represents an
ensemble of thermally accessible conformations (7, 20, 21). Brute-force MD simulations are
thus expected to have an inherent model bias towards the selected starting structures.
Enhanced sampling simulations have been successful in overcoming such bias (22), but are
cumbersome.
Here, by combining all-atom MD simulations and cryo-EM data analysis, we determine the
collection of conformations pertaining to the up state of the RBD. Our results show that in the
apo-state, the spike protein assumes a broadly heterogeneous ensemble of nearly
isoenergetic conformations. The heterogeneity of these structures can substantially exceed
the differences between the average down and up structures inferred by standard cryo-EM
analyses (1, 3). The local movements have a dramatic effect on key binding sites, offering fresh
insights into how molecular recognition occurs at the spike’s ACE2, linoleic acid, antibodiesbinding domains. Our approach offers a useful guide for future work on characterizing the
most probable down to up transitions of the RBD, by integrating experimental cryo-EM data
and MD simulations.

Results
As described below, we extract the conformational energy landscape of the spike protein from
experimental cryo-EM snapshots, and reconstruct 3D density maps along the minimum-freeenergy pathway (MFEP) on this landscape. Molecular dynamics simulations are then employed
to interpret the density information in all-atoms detail. Finally, we present the global and local
conformations of the up-state of the apo spike protein, focusing on the conformational
heterogeneity of key binding pockets.

Conformational coordinates, energy landscape, and functional trajectory
We use geometric machine-learning (ManifoldEM) (23) to extract the manifold of
conformational motions from cryo-EM images. This manifold is spanned by a set of orthogonal
conformational coordinates (CC) (6). To determine the conformational changes along each
coordinate, we compile a 3D movie of the density maps along each of those coordinates.
(Details of the density movie generation scheme is provided in Methods). Fifty density maps
were extracted along each of the two conformational coordinates. The nominal resolution of
these maps varies from 3.2 to 4.4 Å. Molecular dynamics flexible fitting or MDFF was employed
to construct molecular models from each of the maps (24,25), translating the density movies
along CC1 and CC2 to molecular movies (Methods and Supplementary Movies 1 and 2).

By construction, the motions observed along CC1 play out in the XY plane, and motions
observed for CC2 evolve along the Z-axis. Movement along CC1 corresponds to a global change
in the RBD’s center of mass, which deforms orthogonally to the spike protein’s principal axis.
Similarly, motion along CC2 captures a “projectile-like” motion of the RBD parallel to the spike
protein’s principal axis. The functionally relevant conformational movements, however,
involve a combination of CC1 and CC2 along the minimum-energy path on the conformational
landscape (9). As detailed in Methods, we infer free-energy changes from the population of
points on the CC1-CC2 conformational plane via the Boltzmann factor (fig. 1A) (6). The
minimum free energy path on this CC1-CC2 landscape consists of a ‘horse-shoe’ shaped,
essentially iso-energetic tube. Compiling the conformational movies along the MFEP reveals
the functional motions of the spike protein (Supplementary Movie 3), because, near
equilibrium, other conformational states are not significantly occupied.
Previously reported 6VSB (3) and 6VYB (1) densities resemble ManifoldEM models
pertaining to location no. 29 (CC1 21; CC2 31) and its close vicinity on the minimum free energy
pathway in fig. 1A. (See Methods for relating density maps to points on the energy landscape.)
Most of the states along the minimum free energy pathway are nearly isoenergetic, and thus
populated with comparable probabilities. The pursuit of high-resolution structures, however,
may preferentially select a subset of the high probability conformations present (7). key spike
functions (e.g., antibody and receptor binding or epitope signaling) stem from the entire
population of structures along the MFEP. The conformational heterogeneity associated with
the states in this horse-shoe shaped reaction tube highlights the range of global and local
conformations often subsumed by single-model representations, which ignore the underlying
conformational energy landscapes. We already observe at the level of density changes, that
the conformational spectrum along the MFEP of the apo up spike conformation can result in
more open (CC1 25 → 31; CC2 28 → 32) and less open (CC1 17 → 20 and CC2 8 → 12) apo
conformations. These conformations are as probable as those reported in the PDB (1,3). The
variation in conformations of the spike protein is only partially apparent in a comparison
between the reported static apo (1, 3), holo (26–28), and long-time MD simulation models of
the spike (29). In contrast, we circumvent the uncertainties in inferring function from
stationary snapshots (6), by compiling density movies along the MFEP to reveal the functional
trajectory of the apo spike conformation.

Global conformational changes along MFEP
A total of 59 points on MFEP were refined using a multi-grid MDFF procedure (30,31) to gauge
the most probable conformational changes of the apo spike. Shown in Supplementary Movie
3, the set of conformations along the MFEP reveals deviations from the static apo structures
at both ends of the horseshoe-shaped tube. As expected, models stemming from the MFEP
resemble previously published open state structures 6VSB and 6VYB (1,3), with RMSD ranging

from 2.7 to 4.2 Å (fig. S1). This agreement is especially close in the lowest-energy region of the
MFEP (MFEP Location: 20 to 30) and is corroborated by comparable inter-domain distances
between the MFEP models and those previously reported (fig. S2).
Despite these similarities, fig. 2 shows that, along the MFEP, the RBD’s Solvent Accessible
Surface Area (SASA) scores span the range of values previously assigned to differences
between open and closed static structures. The non-biased MD trajectories starting from the
apo model span a smaller range of SASA values than those seen in the MFEP, despite an 800fold longer simulation time. The up RBD’s global conformation is similar to the open spike
structures. However, coupling of the global conformations to local changes at key antibody or
inhibitor pockets along the MFEP is expected to be significant. This issue is investigated in the
next section.
Globally closed or in RBD-down conformation were not observed in any of the MFEP
locations. The distribution of RBD “all-down”, “1-up”, and “2-up” conformations varies across
studies (1,3,32). Typically, both the “RBD down” and “1-up” conformations have been
reported to be in equilibrium, as reflected in the 2:1 to 1:1 population distribution of the 2D
images (1,3). The lack of RBD-down conformations reflects the absence of equilibrium
between the up and the down states in the picked particles used to construct the 6VSB
structure. This supports the notion that, in early SARS-CoV-2 spike protein data (1), the crown
of the spike was over-stabilized to a closed conformation.

Local conformational motions at binding pockets
The starting structure can have a significant impact on the outcome of computations of ligand
protein binding interactions (33, 34). Using the MFEP structures derived from experimental
data, we are able to investigate the impact of the global conformational changes on individual
binding pockets. We choose six previously identified binding pockets: three neutralizing
antibodies (27); linoleic acid (LA) (28); a computationally designed neutralizing mini-protein
(26); and ACE2 (4). By comparing the MFEP structures to apo and holo-structures, we
investigate excursions from the reported structures in terms of internal deformations, solventaccessibility, and the energetics of the individual binding pockets. We also consider the impact
of two important glycans N165 and N234 on stabilizing the spike protein complex.
Fig. S4 shows Root-Mean-Square Standard Deviation (RMSD) plots calculated using
residues specific to each binding pocket. Despite the highest similarity to 6VSB at MFEP
locations 20 to 30 for the global analysis, local variations in RMSD are more pronounced when
the binding pockets are aligned by the residues involved in ligand-protein interactions. In fig.
3, we investigate RMSD excursions from the static structure 6VSB aligned using the entire
monomer. The pattern observed in the global RMSD analysis recurs, whereby MFEP location
28 has the lowest RMSD to 6VSB. However, each binding pocket deviates from 6VSB. The
binding pockets for ACE2 and the mini-protein have high RMSD values at both ends of the

horseshoe shaped MFEP, while the binding pockets for LA, AB-EY6A, and AB-CR3022 maintain
similar RMSD values in all MFEP locations. The binding pocket for AB-C135 deviates strongly
from 6VSB throughout the entire MFEP trajectory. This is discussed further below. In the RMSD
space, it is difficult to determine how amenable a pocket is to binding. However, the LA and
AB-C135 binding pockets display large differences in RMSD between the apo (6VSB) and holostructures. The LA binding pocket is distinctly more apo-like, while the converse is true for the
AB-C135 binding pocket. To avoid uncertainties in interpreting the local RMSD values, we
examine SASA at the local binding-pocket level.
Fig. 4 shows a clear difference between apo and holo binding pockets. This allows direct
comparisons between different MFEP locations, and the tight or loose nature of the binding
pockets from holo and apo discrete structures. For five of the six binding pockets, the MFEP
reveals a larger or comparable variation in SASA compared to the apo “1-up” RBD structures
(6VSB, and 6VYB), the “all-down” RBD structure (6VXX), the holo structure, and 10
microsecond MD ensembles (29). For the five binding pockets, where the MFEP locations span
the SASA variation or openness of the pocket seen for the static and nonbiased MD structures,
the binding mode appears to involve a conformational selection mechanism. For example, the
mini-protein binding pocket in fig. 4, at MFEP locations 4, 47, 49, and 54, the calculated SASA
scores are commensurate with the holo-structure (PDBID: 7JZU), while the rest of the MFEP
locations involve more open structures (higher SASA scores). This suggests that even without
the presence of the mini-protein, the binding pocket is able to adopt a tight binding
configuration amenable to spike protein neutralization. Interestingly, we observe a key
interaction between the LA binding pocket of the “up” RBD and the N234 glycan of the same
chain (see fig. 5). At MFEP locations 51 to 59, the N234 glycan on chain A hydrogen bonds with
residues 387 (Leu) and 388 (Asn), pulling the binding pocket open, and resulting in the “superopen” states seen in fig. 4 at the same MFEP locations.
The AB-C135 binding pocket has a decidedly more closed conformation (fig. 4). The
hydrophobic residues near the AB-C135 binding pocket and at the surface of 6VSB are buried
in our simulations, as indicated by the lower SASA score calculated for 6VSB (see fig. S5). This
suggests the binding mechanism involves an induced fit. the AB-C135 binding pocket is a
“hidden epitope”, indicating that the closed state we find is biologically relevant (26). The map
resolution surrounding this binding pocket has a marginally lower resolution (see fig. S6),
decreasing confidence in the relevance of the observed “super-closed” conformation. The
presence of a closed local pocket in an overall up or open spike RBD further suggests that ABC135 binding entails an induced fit.
So far, we have observed the effect of glycosylation on the LA binding pocket. Fig. 5B shows
that N165 has similar pairwise potential energies for all three intermolecular interactions
between N165 and the RBD of the counterclockwise chain. The pairwise potential energies for
the intramolecular interaction between N234 and the RBD of the same chain show large

differences in the ability of the glycan either to stabilize or destabilize the RBD conformation.
Both the N234B RBDB and N234C RBDC pairwise interactions show positive potential energies in
many of the MFEP locations due to strong van der Waals interactions. These steric interactions
suggest the “down” RBD conformation is destabilized by the presence of N234, as noted by
Amaro and colleagues (26), albeit only for their intermolecular interactions. The N234A RBDA
interaction is negligible in most of the MFEP locations, except in the 50 to 59 range of locations.
In this region, RBDA is stabilized by its interactions with N234A, incidentally creating the “superopen” LA binding pocket discussed above. Finally, fig. S3 shows that comparing SASA values
from MD ensembles derived by fitting a single CC with those utilizing the multigrid procedure
(i.e., the MFEP locations), the single map CC ensembles do not agree with the MFEP locations
at the same CC value. Also, the SASA values for the single CC fitting procedure generally do not
span the same range seen for the MFEP locations. This indicates that single-densities based on
a single CC do not capture conformations similar to those seen along the MFEP.

Discussion and Conclusions
An equilibrium sample of biological macromolecules is inherently conformationally
heterogeneous, because a range of conformational states can have significant thermally
induced occupancies. Conventional cryo-EM data analysis techniques align and average
snapshots with similar particle orientations. While this improves contrast in the 2D images,
there is a loss of thermodynamic information. Also, static models that fit the averaged 3D
reconstruction are ill-suited to describing the system’s conformationally dynamical nature.
Starting from such static models, even unbiased MD cannot capture all the low thermally
accessible conformational states for a given system due to limited sampling times. By
combining data-driven machine learning and MD computations, we have extended the
conformational search around the one-up RBD state by making use of experimentally
determined energy landscapes. This approach has revealed a broad spectrum of hitherto
unobserved iso-energetic conformations associated with RBD binding sites.
The experimentally determined horseshoe shaped MFEP shows it is necessary to move
beyond a rigid one-up RBD state picture, because of substantial conformational heterogeneity
on local and global scales. The concerted movement of the RBD has regional effects, which
entail substantial conformational heterogeneity compared with both apo and holo structures.
Nearly all binding pockets analyzed in this study indicate conformational selection mechanism,
where specific MFEP locations are more or less favorable to binding. MFEP locations with
higher SASA values are interpreted as more amenable to binding, with potential therapeutic
implications. The inclusion of a broad spectrum of low-energy conformations can enable new
drug discovery routes by considering the extensive conformational flexibility of important
binding pockets. By going beyond static structures fitted to heavily averaged maps, our

approach reveals the flexible nature of biological macromolecules, which may have
implications for novel drugs.

Methods
Cryo-EM Data
In this study, we used the cryo-EM images from a previous study (3), in which Sars-CoV-2 spike
ectodomain residues 1 to 1208 were expressed based on the first reported genome sequence
(35), adding two stabilizing proline mutations in the C-terminal S2 fusion machinery. Cryo-EM
grids were prepared using purified fully glycosylated spike protein. Frozen grids were imaged
in a Titan Krios (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a K3 detector (Gatan). Movies were collected
using
Leginon at a magnification of x22,500, (36) corresponding to a calibrated pixel size of 1.047
A/pixel. A full description of sample preparation and data collection parameters can be found˚
in (3). Motion correction, CTF-estimation, and non-templated particle picking were performed
in Warp. (37) There were thousands of images in the 631,920 extracted particles which had
artifacts e.g. harsh line/boxes. Those images were removed. The remaining 574,324 were
imported to CryoSPARC and non-uniform refinement was used to get the orientation of each
particle.

Geometric Machine learning (ManifoldEM)
The details of our data-analytic approach are available at (6). In brief, having assigned an
orientation to each snapshot, we divide the snapshots to small orientational bins, which we
call projection directions (PD). In other words, each PD includes the snapshots which are in
closely similar orientations.
We select all the projection directions lying on a great circle around the orientational
sphere. Then in each projection direction, we use manifold embedding (6) to extract the
conformational manifold. We use the two topmost conformational coordinates to describe
the conformational manifold If we sort the snapshots along each of these eigenfunctions. We
can compile a movie of the conformational changes along those eigenfunctions by using NonLinear Spectral Analysis (38). Fig. 1 shows the first and last frames of the movies
(Supplementary Movie 1 and 2) along with the two conformational coordinates. As the movies
show, CC1 corresponds to a breathing like motion, while in CC2, the RBD moves from a down
position to up.

Integrating the information from all the PDs on a great circle, we compiled 3D
conformational movies of electrostatic potential maps along each of these conformational
coordinates (Supplementary Movie 1 and 2).

Map Preparation
We compiled 50 maps (.spi) along each conformational coordinate. The maps along each
conformational coordinate were then converted from .spi format to .mtz format with Chimera.
(39) The .mtz maps were then converted to potentials thresholding the maps at the solvent
density peak by utilizing the voltools pot command, which is part of the Voltools Plugin within
VMD. (40) These potentials were used to guide the spike protein trimer’s dynamics. The maps
were thresholded again where the RBD density was weak to increase the magnitude of the
potential map gradients for the RBD.

Molecular Dynamics Simulations
We used models from the CHARMM-GUI Archive - COVID-19 Proteins Library. (41) The models
were stripped of all water molecules with the molecular visualization program VMD. (40) All
simulations utilized the generalized Born Implicit Solvent (GBIS) model and Charmm Force
Field, (42) with the molecular dynamics engine NAMD 2.14b1. (43) The simulation parameters
are provided in the supplementary NAMD input file.

Molecular Dynamics Flexible Fitting
MDFF was used to bias simulations and fit atomic models to the extracted conformational
coordinates (24,25). Noting the medium resolution of our experimental maps, only the
backbone of the models was coupled to the density, with the conformations of the remainder
of the system (sidechains and glycans) responding to the MD force fields. To ensure that the
protein backbone conforms to the density, we constrained the protein by knowledge of its
secondary structure, chirality, and cis-peptides; while the less resolved sidechains and glycans
continued to refine under the chemical constraints (bonds, angles, dihedrals, and non-bonded
interactions) imposed by the CHARMM36m force fields.

Conformational Coordinate Fitting
To obtain references for the fitting atomic models on the extracted energy landscape, atomic
models were fitted to each map for both conformational coordinates. Simulations were biased
with two map potentials coupling the singular threshold maps to all backbone atoms except
chain A residues 320 to 520, and the doubly thresholded maps were coupled to the backbone

atoms chain A and residues 320 to 520. The fitting process occurred in two steps starting from
the same starting structure following the cascade-MDFF procedure (22). The blurred maps
were created with the command voltool smooth in the VMD Voltools Plugin. The first step
utilized a 2 A˚ Gaussian blurred potential map, while the second step used maps at their
original resolution of the maps.

MFEP Fitting
A movie of molecular motions was compiled along the MFEP of the energy landscape using a
so-called “multigrid” fitting procedure (30, 31). This procedure enables the construction of
atomic models under the influence of two or more density maps. As outlined in Methods, the
multigrid procedure is employed within MDFF to enable the fitting of the XY-dimension of the
spike protein backbone under the influence of the CC1 maps, while Z-dimensions of these
atoms conform to the CC2 maps. A resolution-exchange protocol was concomitantly employed
(22) to improve the sampling efficiency of the conformational space. Agreement between the
single CC and MFEP fitting in terms of radius of gyration is shown in fig. S7.

SASA Calculations
We used VMD’s measure Plugin to calculate SASA values. The radius sampled around each
atom selected was that atom’s radius + 1.4 A˚ . The static models used for comparison were
built with VMD using the autopsf Plugin to add H at the physiological pH.

Figure 1: The energy landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein spanned by two conformational
coordinates. Each conformational coordinate consists of a space of 50 binned electrostatic potential maps
defining conformational changes in the space of these maps. The MFEP locations are traced with a white
line representing the 59 MFEP locations found in this study. The numbering scheme used here is consistent
with our analysis.

Figure 2: Whole RBD SASA scores calculated for the up RBD (residues 320 to 510). The SASA scores for
static structures are represented with red circles in the left panel, the non-biased equilibrium MD
trajectories are represented with green circles and error bars in the right panel, and finally each MFEP
location SASA scores are represented with blue circles and error bars in the central panel. The error bars
show 1 standard deviation from the mean. The red and blue highlighted regions are used to compare the
spread of SASA scores of the previously deposited static structures (red shading) with the range of SASA
scores seen for all MFEP locations (blue shading).

Figure 3: Binding pocket residues colored by RMSD changes across the minimum free energy path. The
residues involved in binding are used to calculate the RMSD at MFEP locations 0, 15, 28, 43, and 59 (see
Fig. 1) and are shown in a licorice representation. The RMSD values range from 0 to 1 following the color
scale at the top of the figure. The structure 6VSB is shown for comparison on the far left.

Figure 4: Individual binding pocket SASA scores calculated from only those residues involved in binding. For
all six panels, the SASA scores for static structures are represented with red circles, non-biased equilibrium
MD trajectories are represented with green circles and error bars, and finally each MFEP location SASA
score is represented with blue circles and error bars. The red and blue highlighted regions are used to
compare the spread of SASA scores of the previously deposited static structures (red shading) with the range
of SASA scores seen for all MFEP locations (blue shading).
