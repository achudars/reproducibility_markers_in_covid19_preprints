ABSTRACT

44

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the

45

pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Great international efforts have been

46

put into the development of prophylactic vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. However,

47

the knowledge about the B cell immune response induced by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is

48

still limited. Here, we report a comprehensive characterization of the dynamics of

49

immunoglobin heavy chain (IGH) repertoire in COVID-19 patients. By using next-

50

generation sequencing technology, we examined the temporal changes in the landscape

51

of the patient’s immunological status, and found dramatic changes in the IGH within the

52

patients’ immune system after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Although different

53

patients have distinct immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, by employing

54

clonotype overlap, lineage expansion and clonotype network analyses, we observed a

55

higher clonotype overlap and substantial lineage expansion of B cell clones during 2-3

56

weeks of illness, which is of great importance to B-cell immune responses. Meanwhile,

57

for preferences of V gene usage during SARS-CoV-2 infection, IGHV3-74 and IGHV4-

58

34 and IGHV4-39 in COVID-19 patients were more abundant than that of healthy

59

controls. Overall, we present an immunological resource for SARS-CoV-2 that could

60

promote both therapeutic development as well as mechanistic research.

INTRODUCTION

63

The current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection is threatening global public health [1]. The

64

scale of the humanitarian and economic impact of the COVID-19 is driving intense efforts

65

to develop vaccines and neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against COVID-19. Therefore,

66

understanding the principles of the B-cell responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection is of

67

substantial importance for anti-viral vaccine and NAb developmeent.

68
69

The B-cell receptors (BCRs) are immunoglobin molecules located on B-cell surfaces to

70

recognize and bind foreign antigens. Upon encountering their specific antigen, B-cells

71

become activated, proliferate, and may differentiate to produce short-lived effective

72

antibody-secreting plasma cells or long-lived plasma cells and memory cells. At the same

73

time, BCRs undergo a process of affinity maturation, which repeats cycles of somatic

74

hypermutation of BCRs and subsequent clonal selection leads to increased binding

75

affinity. BCRs are composed of two heavy chain molecules and two light chain molecules,

76

encoded in humans by the immunoglobin heavy chain (IGH) gene and light chains (IGL

77

or IGK) gene, respectively. Comparison of BCR sequences among individuals is of great

78

interest because repertoires may have similar features if individuals are exposed to the

79

same pathogen, giving rise to convergent antibodies.

81

Antibody specificity is largely determined by the IGH gene sequence used by each B-cell

82

[2]

83

character IGH repertoire in large numbers of samples and it is increasingly being applied

84

to gain insights into the humoral responses in healthy individuals and a wide range of

85

diseases. This technic has also led to advances in our understanding of how the antibody

86

repertoire changes in response to perturbation arising from an initial viral infection, viral

87

evolution, and vaccination. BCR repertoire analysis has been applied, for example, to

88

influenza virus

89

infection remain to be determined.

. The recent developments in high-throughput sequencing have made it feasible to

[3][4]

, human immunodeficiency virus

[5]

, varicella-zoster virus

[6]

and

[7]

. However, the dynamics of antibody response elicited by SARS-CoV-2

91
92

To understand how B-cell immune repertoire changes over time during SARS-CoV-2

93

infection, we obtained IGH repertoires from the peripheral blood samples which were

94

collected multiple times from five COVID-19 patients. We classified sequences into

95

clones by lineage clustering analysis, and tracked changes in the unique number of CDR3,

96

Shannon index, the number of high-frequency clones, cumulative frequency of the top

97

100 clones, and V, J-gene segment usage at different course of time. We also conducted

98

clonotype overlap, lineage expansion, and CDR3 sequence network structure to explore

99

the similarity and varying trends of IGH repertoire status at different time points. Overall,

100

during the high degree of heterogeneity in B-cell clonal dynamics among patients, key

101

common patterns were observed, i.e. the higher clonotype overlap and substantial lineage

102

expansion of COVID-19 patients during 2-3 weeks of illness. The findings in this study

103

provides basic knowledge support for the immune response research of COVID-19

104

patients and the development of corresponding antibody drugs and vaccines.

Library preparation and repertoire sequencing

124

Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from blood samples

125

of five COVID-19 patients as well as three healthy donors by density gradient

126

centrifugation in Ficoll-Paque Plus buffer (GE Healthcare, USA). Total RNA was

127

extracted from approximately 1×105 PBMCs of each sample using Trizol Reagent

128

(Invitrogen, USA). cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase

129

(Invitrogen, USA) and Oligo-dN6 random primer. The variable domain of IGH was

130

amplified by using six V segment specific primers designed from FR1 region and one J

131

segment specific primer designed from FR4 region [8]. The PCR program began with an

132

initial denaturation at 95 ℃ for 15 min, followed by 28 cycles of denaturation at 94 ℃

133

for 30 s, annealing of primer to DNA at 60 ℃ for 90 s, and extension by 2 × multiplex

134

PCR master mix (QIAGEN, USA) at 72 ℃ for 30 s. Following the cycling, the reaction

135

was at 72 ℃ for 5 min, with a final step at 12 ℃ to hold the terminated reaction. The

136

amplified PCR products were then purified by the same volume of the Ampure-XP beads.

137

Subsequently, the purified PCR products were end-repaired and ligated with a sequencing

138

adapter. The sequencing libraries were quantified using Qubit ssDNA HS (High

139

Sensitivity) Assay Kit (Invitrogen, USA) and sequenced by MGISEQ-2000 (MGI, China)

140

platform with 400 bp single-end reads.

141
142

Basic data processing

143

The single-end 400 bp reads of the samples from the five COVID-19 patients sequenced

144

at MGISEQ-2000 platform were analyzed by IMonitor [9] software. Briefly, the raw reads

145

were filtered and trimmed by SOAPnuke

146

sequences. Reference germline gene segments were collected from IMGT database

147

BLAST [12] program was used to align all clean reads to a reference, and then a second

148

alignment procedure was executed to improve the alignment accuracy. Subsequently,

149

structure analysis was performed to deduce the structure of BCR molecular, including V,

150

D, and J segments usage, the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the CDR3 region,

151

and the deletions and insertions at rearrangement sites. Finally, several characters

152

reflecting the status of the immune repertoire were counted, such as V-J pairing, V/J usage,

153

CDR3 sequence frequency, and CDR3 length distribution.

to remove low-quality reads and adapter

Lineage identification and effective data normalization

156

We define sequences belonging to the same clonal lineage as those sharing the same

157

variable (V) and joining (J) germline gene combination, CDR3 length, and at least 90%

158

nucleotide sequence identity in the CDR3 region. According to this definition, we first

159

grouped sequence with identical V and J germline gene origination and same CDR3

160

length, following clustering those group by CD-HIT (version 4.6) [13] with the following

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.28.424622; this version posted December 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this

161

parameters: -c 0.9, -G 1, -b 20, -d 0 and -n 9. To eliminate the impact of the difference in

162

data volume on clonal diversity, we normalized each of the IGH clones to a unanimous

163

number. Firstly, we counted an effective data size (with an “in-frame” tag in the IMonitor

164

result) for each sample and removed some samples with significantly fewer effective data

165

than others. Secondly, normalized data with the same size were extracted randomly from

166

each sample by an in-house Perl program.

167
168

Feature parameters analysis and comparison of usage frequency of V/J germline

169

gene segments

170

There are several commonly used parameters reflecting the features of the BCR repertoire,

171

including unique CDR3 number, Shannon index, high-frequency clone number, and

172

cumulate frequency of the top 100 clones. we are using an in-house Perl script to count

173

those parameters base on normalized data from each sample. The Shannon index is

174

frequently used as measures of repertoire diversity, we calculated the Shannon index of

175

observed clones from normalized data using the following function:
𝑁

𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑜𝑛 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 = − ∑ 𝑝(𝑖)𝑙𝑛𝑝(𝑖)

176

𝑖=1

177

where N is the total number of unique CDR3, and p(i) is the frequency of a single CDR3

178

in the BCR repertoire.

179
180

After data normalization, gene usage frequency of V and J segments were counted and a

181

k-means hierarchical clustering process was executed by R package “hclust” to compare

182

V/J segment usage similarity both within and among individuals.

183
184

Overlap analysis of BCR repertoire

185

Repertoire overlap analysis is a similarity measure to evaluate the correlation of

186

overlapping clonotypes between samples. The Jaccard index, also known as intersection

187

over union and the Jaccard similarity coefficient, can be used to gauging the similarity

188

and diversity of different repertoires. To explore the impact of onset time on the status of

189

the BCR repertoire, we counted the Jaccard index to assess the association between the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.28.424622; this version posted December 29, 2020. The copyright holder for this

190

repertoire at different onset times, the index is calculated as follows:

191

𝐽(𝐴, 𝐵) =

|𝐴 ∩ 𝐵|
|𝐴| + |𝐵| − |𝐴 ∩ 𝐵|

192

Where |A | denotes the total number of unique CDR3 in sample A, |A∩B| represents the

193

intersection of the unique CDR3 number in samples A and B.

194
195

We calculate pairwise overlap rate as Jaccard index multiplied by 100, and divided the

196

pairwise overlap rate into 3 clusters: the first cluster is “2-3 week adjacents” including

197

data of time points 12-13 days versus 15-16 days and 15-16 days versus 18-19 days after

198

onset; the second cluster is “other adjacents” which contains two adjacent time points

199

except “2-3 week adjacents”; the third cluster is “non adjacent” which contains all of the

200

paired non-adjacent time points. Two-sample Wilcoxon test (Wilcoxon test in R) was used

201

to compare the difference between clusters.

202
203

Lineage expansion analysis

204

A lineage expansion analysis was performed based on the normalized data, Firstly, a join

205

samples process was executed to join lineage information at all time points inside each

206

patient together, normalized lineage frequency was computed as the geometric mean of

207

lineage frequencies that comprise a given joint lineage in intersected time points if the

208

lineage is missing, its frequency is set to 1e-9, only the most abundant CDR3 sequence

209

was selected as a representative clonotype in each lineage. Secondly, an R program

The network is generating through the BCR CDR3 amino acid similarity, where each

215

vertex in the network represents a CDR3 amino acid sequence, the size of the point

216

represents the abundance of the clone, any two vertices meet the following three

217

conditions, including same length, same V and J gene usage, and only one amino

Parameters of the network calculation

222

The parameters of the network, including vertices, cluster number, and diameter of the

package. The Gini coefficient is used as measures of inequality in distribution, we

225

calculated the Gini coefficient of clone frequency distribution and cluster clone number

Basic Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 patients

234

Among the five patients diagnosed with COVID-19, the 85-year-old patient developed

235

severe symptoms, and the other four patients aged between 15 to 45 developed mild

236

symptoms (Table 1). Blood samples were collected at day 2-5 after diagnosis with 2-3

237

days intervals until they were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 on day 17-19. All of them

238

were discharged from the hospital upon recovery. Notably, 3 of the 5 patients are from

239

the same family, that is, patient 2 is son of patient 1 and patient 3.

240
241

During the process of COVID-19 diagnosis, several clinical indicators were detected by

242

routine blood examination. At least three of the 5 patients (2 of them have too few tested

243

indicators and can’t be reasonably counted) showed pronounced lymphopenia. Along

244

with the progression of COVID-19, the percentage of T lymphocytes went through a

245

process of decreasing firstly and then increasing. The phenomenon of lymphopenia in

246

COVID-19 patients in our results is highly consistent with previous studies. It is well

247

established that the lymphopenia is a major immunological abnormality occurs in

248

COVID-19 patients [15, 16, 17, 18]. However, we found that the percentage of B lymphocytes

249

showed an opposite trend to T cells, among these patients, the percentage of B cells in

250

patient P3, P4 and P5 reached the highest value until 14th, 6th and 17th day after the onset

251

of the disease, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). At the same time, B cell clonal

252

expansion reached the peak value from immune repertoire analysis (Fig 3).

253
254

IGH repertoire altered substantially upon infection with SARS-CoV-2

255

We performed longitudinal IGH repertoire sequencing to examine the global effects of

256

SARS-CoV-2 infection on the B-cell compartment (Fig 1 a). To enable direct

257

comparisons among time points of each patient, datasets of all time points of each patient

258

were sub-sampled to a unanimous number of clonotypes. We investigated the diversity of

259

the IGH repertoires through four parameters, which are unique CDR3 number, Shannon

260

index, high-frequency clone number (frequency > 0.1%), and cumulate frequency of top

261

100 clones with the highest frequency. These parameters fluctuate substantially

262

throughout time with no common tendencies among patients (Fig 1 b-e), which may due

263

to the dramatic change of the predominant clones and lineages.

264
265

Next, we thought to test whether there are preferences of V and J gene segments during

266

SARS-CoV-2 infection. By using hierarchical clustering strategy, we compared the V and

267

J gene usage frequency of COVID-19 patients with that of healthy donors. However,

268

compared with healthy donors, we did not find overall preference in the usage of V or J

269

genes among COVID-19 patients, the overall use of each V and J component was highly

270

nonuniform within each individual (Fig1 f, g). The most frequently observed V segments

271

were IGHV3-23, IGHV3-30, IGHV4-34, IGHV4-39, and IGHV4-59, which is similar to

272

previous studies [19, 20]. The IGHV3-74, IGHV4-34 and IGHV4-39 in COVID-19 patients

273

showed more abundant than that of healthy controls. Preferred J gene segments showed

274

a high degree of consistency among all time points in both patients and healthy donors

275

(Fig 1 g), with the most frequent J segment is IGHJ4, this is consistent with previously

276

report

277

infection time course was fairly stable, shown as high correlations in the heatmap of Fig

we examined how the composition of the clonotype changed during the infection. We

evaluated the level of clonotype overlap between any two time points of each patient by

297

using an all-versus-all pairwise overlap analysis. In general, the overlap rate between

298

different time points ranges from 0.36% to 6.57% (average 2.13%) in each individual

299

(Fig 2 a-e). As expected, samples from adjacent sampling batches share more clones than

300

those from other batches. A notable rule that shows in almost each patient is that the

301

overlap rate of adjacent batches peaks at around 2-3 weeks. We found that “2-3 week

302

adjacents” cluster shared significantly more clones than “other adjacents” (p=7.78 x 10-

Next, we investigated the relative degree of clonal expansion. To measure the alterations

319

in lineage frequency over time, we first defined clonotypes as a lineage if they meet 3

320

criteria: sharing the same VH and JH germline gene segments, having the same nucleotide

321

length in the CDR3 region, and at least 90% nucleotide identity in the CDR3 region.

322

Using this strategy, we computed the geometric mean of linage frequencies of all samples

323

and performed a lineage tracking analysis using VDJtools. Here, we defined the highly

324

expanded lineages as the most 100 abundant lineages (top 100 lineages). We observed an

325

evident lineage expansion process over time. As shown in Fig 3 a-e, the cumulative

326

frequencies of the top 100 lineages of almost all patients increased after the second or

327

third weeks following the onset of illness, with the cumulative frequencies of the top 100

328

lineages peaked at day 18-19 in Patient 1 and Patient 5, day 12-13 in Patient 3, day 6-7 in

329

Patient 4 and both peaked at day 6-7 and day 18-19 in Patient 2. After that, this part of

330

lineages began to decrease gradually. This result indicates that during the 2-3 weeks of

331

disease progression, the patient’s IGH repertoire experienced a substantial lineage

332

expansion.

BCRs with similar CDR3 amino acid sequences are supposed to be gathered in clusters

based on antigen-driven somatic hypermutation (SHM). To investigate the degree of

clone convergence during the disease, we build the BCR repertoire CDR3 sequence

344

network for each individual using data of different times after the onset of the disease

345

based on a specific approach [23]. Networks of all the 5 patients after symptom onset have

346

been plotted in Supplementary Fig 1 and the network of the 41-year-old female patient

347

1 (P1) at different time point is demonstrated in Fig 4a since its relatively high number

348

of CDR3 clones (vertices). Here, a clear clonal clustering phenomenon could be seen

349

from the network of this patient on day 18-19 (Fig 4a). Subsequently, three network-

350

related parameters, namely diameter of the largest cluster, Gini coefficient of cluster clone

351

number, and Gini coefficient of clone frequency, were counted and summarized in Fig 4

352

b-d. There was a similar trend that first goes up and peaks around 2-3 weeks and fall

353

afterward in these three parameters of almost all patients. Each parameter of the network

354

has its implication, firstly, the diameter parameter exhibit in Fig 4b is the length of the

355

longest geodesic (edges between any two reachable vertices) of a network. The result

356

indicates higher evolution level of BCR clones in the repertoire from 2-3 weeks. Secondly,

357

the Gini coefficient of cluster clone number which represents the level of clonal clustering

358

also peaked around 2-3 weeks. Thirdly, the Gini coefficient of clone frequency which

359

indicates the skewed expansion of several clones were very much synchronized with the

360

former parameter, despite they were relatively independent. Moreover, the most abundant

361

clones usually don’t appear in the largest cluster (Fig 4d, Supplementary Fig 1), the

362

formation of big clusters may be due to the rapid iteration of naïve B-cells to generate

363

affinity maturation, while the clonal expansion may result from the proliferate of the

364

effector cells. Nevertheless, both the cluster clone number increasement and clonal

365

expansion are supposed to be triggered by the reaction to counteract the SARS-CoV-2

366

infection.

DISCUSSION

378

To obtain a more detailed understanding of the dynamics and sophistication of B-cell

379

immune response in COVID-19 patients, we applied a comprehensive analysis of IGH

380

repertoire during the disease process. Given the advantages of longitudinal data in

381

profiling the fast repertoire dynamics through time in individuals responding to an

382

immune challenge [19, 24], we collected a set of longitudinal immune repertoire data from

383

5 COVID-19 patients and conducted a detailed analysis of their B-cell immune repertoires.

384

The simultaneous profiling of clonotype overlap, lineage expansion and clonotype

385

network enabled us to find that a period of 2-3 weeks after symptom onset is of great

386

importance to B-cell immune response. In short, these results reveal a clear dynamic

387

landscape of BCR repertoire in COVID-19 patients, as well as the characteristics of the

388

immune repertoire at different time points after symptom onset.

389
390

V, J gene usage analysis revealed that each individual’s frequency of different V and J

391

gene segment usage stays relatively stable over time (Fig 1f). Similar results have also

392

been reported by Chen Wang et. al

393

altered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the overall use of V components among

394

patients shows a differentiated preference. As Petter Brodin mentioned

395

reflect that the human immune system is highly variable between individuals but

396

relatively stable over time within a given person. We observed a preference of the use of

397

V gene segments inconsistent with the single cell BCR repertoire research by Wen et al

398

[25]

399

reported that IGHV3-23 was over-represented in patients compared with health controls,

400

while both our and Jacob's result showed that IGHV3-23 is highly represented both in

401

patients and healthy controls. Additionally, we and Jacob’s group both found that IGHV4-

402

34 are more frequently used in COVID-19 patients compared with healthy donors. We

403

believe that, given the advantages of large amounts of sequencing data, bulk BCR

404

sequencing may be more suitable for BCR gene usage frequency assessment.

405

Nevertheless, with only five patients, the power of our study is almost certainly

406

constrained by a small sample size. Larger samples and more sequencing data need to be

407

collected to help further understand these differences.

[6]

. Suggesting that V, J segment use is not markedly

[22]

, this may

, but consistent with Jacob's [26] bulk BCR repertoire study, for example, Wen’s group

408
409

We found from the longitudinal immune repertoire data that all patients’ BCR repertoire

410

composition in 2-3 weeks of onset is obviously different from that in other periods. There

411

are significantly more common clones between adjacent time points and evident lineage

412

expansion during 2-3 weeks. Additionally, network analysis revealed that each patient’s

413

average degree and diameter indicators peaked around 2-3 weeks after onset. This

414

timeline of repertoire change is consistent with an antigen (virus) induced B-cell

415

differentiation and maturation. The maturation process is on a par with other viruses, such

416

as influenza viruses [27], a similar phenomenon has also been observed in patients with

417

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [28]. We speculated that the higher clonotype

418

overlap and substantial lineage expansion of COVID-19 patients during 2-3 weeks of

419

illness may be associated with strong neutralizing antibody responses, accompanied by a

420

large expansion of virus-specific B-cell clones and finally causing B-cell clone

421

convergence.

422
423

Many studies have shown that the monoclonal antibodies targeting viral surface antigens

424

have therapeutic and preventive effects on infectious diseases such as HIV, Ebola and

425

MERS [29, 30, 31]. Their safety and effectiveness in patients have been confirmed in many

426

clinical trials [32, 33]. With the efforts of scientists from various countries, recent positive

427

progress has been made in the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs [34 ,35, 36, 37, 38, 39].

428

Our study can provide some clues in the development of neutralizing antibodies. The

429

following rules should be taken into consideration in the screening of the SARS-CoV-2

430

neutralizing antibodies: Firstly, whether or not they are the highly overlapped clones

431

during 2-3 weeks is of great potential. Secondly, the expansion size of clones which

432

usually taken as an important criterion to select antibodies in other studies should also be

433

involved. Subsequently, the cluster size in the network at the time window may also play

434

their roles. It was interesting to find from the networks that highly expanded clones did

435

not appear in the highly aggregated clusters, which was quite different from the blood

436

cancer patients’ BCR repertoire network structure

437

are also important because they may be the B-cells iterating to gain a higher affinity to

438

the virus antigen. Studies containing the B-cell isotype information may further reveal if

439

the excessively clustered clones are more likely to be IgD/IgM naïve cells and the

440

expanded clones are usually IgA/IgG effector cells. Nevertheless, the CDR3 sequence

441

information from the selected antibodies may provide us the basis to produce specific

442

drugs and vaccines.

[23]

. We speculate that the big clusters

444

In general, based on high-throughput immune repertoire sequencing technology, this

445

study provides a comprehensive B cell deep immune profiling of COVID-19 patients,

446

conclusions from this research will help understand the immune response of COVID-19
