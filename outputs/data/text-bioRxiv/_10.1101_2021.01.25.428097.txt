Abstract

30

Functional and lasting immune responses to the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) are currently

31

under intense investigation as antibody titers in plasma have been shown to decline during

32

convalescence. Since the absence of antibodies does not equate to absence of immune memory,

33

we sought to determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B cells in COVID-19

34

convalescent patients. In this study, we report on the evolution of the overall humoral immune

35

responses on 101 blood samples obtained from 32 COVID-19 convalescent patients between 16

36

and 233 days post-symptom onset. Our observations indicate that anti-Spike and anti-RBD IgM

37

in plasma decay rapidly, whereas the reduction of IgG is less prominent. Neutralizing activity in

38

convalescent plasma declines rapidly compared to Fc-effector functions. Concomitantly, the

39

frequencies of RBD-specific IgM+ B cells wane significantly when compared to RBD-specific IgG+

40

B cells, which increase over time, and the number of IgG+ memory B cells which remain stable

41

thereafter for up to 8 months after symptoms onset. With the recent approval of highly effective

42

vaccines for COVID-19, data on the persistence of immune responses are of central importance.

43

Even though overall circulating SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific antibodies contract over time during

44

convalescence, we demonstrate that RBD-specific B cells increase and persist up to 8 months

45

post symptom onset. We also observe modest increases in RBD-specific IgG+ memory B cells

46

and importantly, detectable IgG and sustained Fc-effector activity in plasma over the 8-month

47

period. Our results add to the current understanding of immune memory following SARS-CoV-2

48

infection, which is critical for the prevention of secondary infections, vaccine efficacy and herd

49

immunity against COVID-19.

Introduction

51

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the

52

ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, is highly contagious and has infected

53

close to a 100 million people worldwide and caused over 2 million deaths since its discovery. The

54

dynamics and persistence of immune responses in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 is

55

currently under needful investigation. Several studies with acute and convalescent COVID-19

56

patients have showed prompt induction of B and T cell responses upon infection, along with the

57

detection of antigen-specific memory B and T cell responses several weeks into convalescence

58

(1-6). Additionally, antibodies induced upon infection have been shown to protect from SARS-

59

CoV-2 reinfection in animal models (7-9). Passive immunization using neutralizing monoclonal

60

antibody treatments decreased viral loads in animal studies and in patients with COVID-19 (10,

61

11). The viral target of neutralizing antibodies is the highly immunogenic trimeric Spike (S)

62

glycoprotein, which facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells via its receptor-binding domain

63

(RBD) that interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) (12, 13).

64
65

The evolution of overall antibody responses in convalescent individuals is being extensively

66

analysed, with studies showing that Ab titers and neutralization activity against Spike start

67

decreasing during the first weeks after resolution of infection (5, 6, 14-18). Importantly, in addition

68

to neutralizing viral particles, the antiviral activities of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies can

69

expand to involve Fc-effector functions, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)

70

(19, 20). Recent research has highlighted the importance of humoral development and the ability

71

of antibodies to carry out Fc-effector functions in decreasing mortality of patients exhibiting severe

72

disease symptoms (21).

73
74

In this study, we dissect multiple aspects of humoral immunity, including Fc-effector functions and

75

antigen-specific B cells, longitudinally for up to 8 months post symptom onset (PSO) in 32

immunity, which is important in the context of secondary infections, vaccine efficacy and herd

Results

81

SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific and Spike-specific antibody levels in convalescent plasma

82

decrease up to 8 months post-symptom onset.

83

To monitor the evolution of antibody responses longitudinally, we analyzed serological samples

84

from 32 convalescent individuals (Table 1) along with 10 pre-pandemic samples from uninfected

85

individuals as experimental controls. The average age of the donors was 47 years old (range: 20-

86

65 years), and samples were from 17 males and 15 females. Convalescent patients were sampled

87

at four longitudinal time points between 16 and 233 days PSO: 6 weeks (16-95 days; median: 43

88

days), 11 weeks (48-127 days; median: 77 days), 21 weeks (116-171 days; median: 145 days),

89

and 31 weeks (201-233 days; median: 218 days). Participants were tested positive for SARS-

90

CoV-2 infection by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swab specimens.

91

Convalescent participants were enrolled following two negative RT-PCR tests and a complete

92

resolution of symptoms for at least 14 days before blood sampling.

93
94

We began by evaluating the presence of RBD-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies by using a

95

previously published enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against the SARS-CoV-2

96

RBD antigen (16). In agreement with recent reports showing the waning of antibody levels in

97

longitudinal convalescent plasma over time (14-17), we observed that total RBD-specific

98

immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, comprising of IgG, IgM, and IgA, gradually decreased between 6 and

99

31 weeks after the onset of symptoms (Figure 1A). However, the percentage of convalescent

100

individuals presenting detectable RBD-specific Ig levels remained stable, with a consistent

101

seropositivity rate above 90% throughout the sampling time frame. Notably, 100% of the donors

102

still had detectable IgG at the last time point, while IgM and IgA diminished more rapidly, with

103

85% and 69% of the donors having undetectable IgM and IgA levels, respectively, 31 weeks PSO

104

(Figure 1B-D; Figure S1A). Since the RBD ELISA is limited to detect antibodies targeting only one

105

domain of the Spike, we developed a high-throughput cell-based ELISA methodology to screen

106

for antibodies recognizing the native full-length S protein on the cell surface. HOS cells stably

107

expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoproteins were incubated with plasma samples, followed by

108

the addition of secondary antibodies recognizing IgG, IgM, and/or IgA. We observed that 100%

109

of the donors still had detectable S-specific total Ig and IgG in their plasma at 31 weeks PSO

110

whereas, only 38% and 54% of the plasma samples tested positive for the presence of Spike-

111

specific IgM and IgA, respectively (Figure 1 E-H; Figure S1B). We confirmed this observation

112

using a recently characterized flow-cytometry based assay (22) determining antibody binding to

113

the full-length S protein on the surface of 293T cells (Figure S2A). The data obtained with both

114

the cell-based ELISA and flow-cytometry techniques correlated significantly (r = 0.8120;

115

p<0.0001) (Figure S2B).

116
117

Neutralizing and Fc-effector activities of antibodies present in convalescent plasma

118

decrease at different rates over time.

119

Recent studies have shown the importance of neutralizing antibodies in reducing viral load and

120

preventing infection in animal models (10, 23, 24). Neutralizing monoclonal antibody cocktails

121

also reduced viral load in COVID-19 patients (11). Neutralizing activity is often considered as a

122

determining factor in convalescent plasma therapy, although its relative importance compared to

123

Fc-effector activity is still unknown (25-27). Thus, we measured the capacity of convalescent

124

plasma to neutralize pseudoviral particles carrying the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein over time.

125

Neutralizing antibody titers (ID50) were detected in 63% of the donors at 6 weeks PSO, while none

126

of the uninfected controls had detectable neutralizing activity. Titers declined from 155.6 at 6

127

weeks to 60.0 at 31 weeks PSO, respectively, with 77% of donors having undetectable

128

neutralization activity in their plasma at the last time point (Figure 2A). Since the depletion of IgM

129

from plasma has been associated with loss of viral neutralization capacity (28, 29) and IgA has

130

also been shown to dominate the early neutralizing response (30, 31), the sharp decline in

131

neutralization activity seen in this study is corroborated by the striking decrease in anti-Spike and

132

anti-RBD IgM and IgA levels (Figure 1B, D, F, H; Figure S1A, B).

133
134

Fc-mediated effector functions of antibodies can contribute to the efficacy of immune response

135

against SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies have examined Fc-mediated effector functions of

136

antibodies elicited upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (19, 32). Both the presence of IgG and their Fc-

137

mediated effector activities have been linked to reduced severity of disease (21). Herein, we

138

assessed the ability of plasma from convalescent donors to trigger ADCC responses over time.

139

We developed a new ADCC assay using a human T-lymphoid cell line resistant to NK cell-

140

mediated cell lysis (CEM.NKr) and stably expressing the full-length S protein on the cell surface

141

as target cells. PBMCs from healthy individuals were used as effector cells. ADCC activity was

142

measured by the loss of Spike-expressing GFP+ target cells (Figure S3). We observed that ADCC

143

activity of convalescent plasma decreased gradually between 6 weeks and 31 weeks PSO (Figure

144

2B). However, this decline was modest when compared to the decrease in neutralization activity

145

of plasma (Figure S1C) and 85% of the donors’ plasma still elicited substantial ADCC activity at

146

the latest study time point. The presence of Fc-mediated antibody effector functions up to 8

147

months PSO is corroborated with the presence of significant IgG levels.

148
149

RBD-specific memory B cells develop and remain stable up to 8 months post-symptom

150

onset.

151

Recent studies on convalescent COVID-19 patients have indicated persistent antigen-specific

152

memory B cell responses despite waning antibody levels (5, 6). To monitor the circulating B cell

153

compartment in our cohort of convalescent individuals, antigen-specific B cells were characterized

154

by flow cytometry (identified as CD19+ CD20+). To identify distinct RBD-specific B cells, we used

155

double discrimination with two recombinant RBD protein preparations labelled with fluorochromes

156

Alexa-Fluor 594 and Alexa-Fluor 488, respectively. Detection of this double positive population

157

was specific since it was not detected in PBMCs from uninfected individuals (Figure S4A, B).

158

RBD-specific B cells were detected 6 weeks PSO with a modest increase in mean frequency up

159

to 31 weeks PSO (0.038% to 0.051%) (Figure 3B). Total RBD-specific B cells were evaluated to

160

distinguish surface Ig isotypes and we observed IgG+, IgM+ and IgA+ cells in 100%, 92% and

161

83% of donors at 6 weeks PSO, respectively. Strikingly, the frequency of RBD-specific IgM+ B

162

cells decreased significantly, with 46% of the donors having undetectable IgM+ B cells 31 weeks

163

PSO (Figure 3C; Figure S1D). Conversely, the frequency of RBD-specific IgG+ B cells

164

significantly increased between 6 and 21 weeks PSO and remained stable up to 8 months PSO

165

(Figure 3D); the detection of RBD-specific IgA+ B cells also persisted in 77% of the donors tested

166

(Figure 3E; Figure S1D). Furthermore, the total RBD-specific B cells were evaluated to distinguish

167

memory and naïve B cells (identified by using CD27 and CD21 markers; Figure S4C, D).

168

Importantly, total RBD-specific memory B cells were detected in 100% of the donors and the

169

mean frequency remained stable between 6 and 31 weeks PSO (0.020% to 0.026%), while RBD-

170

specific naïve B cells were observed in lower proportions and modestly decreased over time

171

(Figure 3F, G). Interestingly, the proportion of donors positive for RBD-specific naïve B cells was

172

reduced by half between the first and last time point as also observed for RBD-specific IgM+ B

173

cells which is consistent with the decline in IgM levels observed between these groups. IgG+

174

RBD-specific memory B cells were detected in 100% of the donors and the frequency of this

175

population modestly increased up to 31 weeks PSO (Figure 3H). Meanwhile, the frequencies of

176

IgA+ RBD-specific memory B cells were low but stable over the 8-month period (Figure 3G, I).

177

Evaluation of the relationship between different aspects of humoral immunity reveals the

178

importance of IgG responses.

179

To examine interrelations between serological, immunological, and functional parameters

180

assessed in this study, we performed comprehensive sets of correlation analyses. Firstly, at each

181

time point, the strongest immune response clusters were comprised of total Ig and IgG binding

182

levels and thus, increased ADCC activity (Figure 4A, left panel). In contrast, weaker immune

183

response clusters in plasma were formed by IgA and IgM levels and subsequently, neutralization

184

capacities. Overall, the responses decreased over the course of the 8-month period (Figure 4B).

185

The inverse was observed with antigen-specific B cell frequencies (Figure 4B). Apart from naïve

186

B cells and the IgM fraction thereof, total RBD-specific B cells increased over the course of 8

187

months. At each time point, total IgG+ B cells and memory B cells (IgA+ and IgG+) constituted

188

the most prominent responses (Figure 4A, right panel).

189
190

Additionally, at the earliest time point convalescent plasma was collected after symptom onset (6

191

weeks PSO), we observed a vast network of strong positive correlations among

192

populations, antibody levels, and antibody-mediated functional parameters (Figure 5B).

193

Intriguingly, this was followed by a striking disconnect of associations between B cell frequencies

194

and serological parameters at 11, 21, and 31 weeks PSO (Figure 5C-E). This is caused by the

195

concomitant diminution of antibody levels, yet stabilization of antigen-specific B cells observed at

196

these time points, suggestive of decreased antibody production by B cells after resolution of

197

infection or the gradual replacement of Ig-secreting short-lived plasma cell by memory B cells.

198

When considering the collective datasets, prominent features were two subsequently dividing

199

positive correlation clusters, the first among total and IgG+ RBD-specific B cells and the second

200

among ADCC with total Ig and IgG binding responses. Furthermore, days PSO inversely

201

correlated with neutralization as well as IgM and IgA-specific responses (Figure 5A and S5).

Discussion

203

A better understanding of the type and longevity of immune responses following viral infections

204

are critical to reveal immune mechanisms involved in protection from re-infection and protection

205

by vaccination. Data regarding these important issues continues to be gathered for SARS-CoV-

206

2. In this study, we have contributed to the current understanding by reporting on the evolution of

207

the overall humoral immune responses in 101 blood samples obtained from 32 COVID-19

208

convalescent patients between 16 and 233 days PSO. Overall, we observed that IgM levels and

209

the neutralizing capacity of plasma decreases rapidly, whereas IgG and Fc-effector activity are

210

more sustained (Figure 6). The antibody kinetics we observed herein are typical of those seen for

211

other human coronavirus infections, with antibodies peaking 2-4 weeks PSO followed by a

212

contraction phase (33). Furthermore, we show that COVID-19 patients generate RBD-specific

213

memory B cells and IgG+ B memory cells that persist for over 8 months. Similarly, recent studies

214

on the durability of SARS-CoV-2 immune responses have shown that although antibody levels

215

decrease, Spike-specific IgG+ memory B cell responses are generated and maintained (1, 5, 6).

216

Additionally, studies demonstrated enhanced cellular immunity that protects non-human primates

217

from SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in the context of waning neutralizing antibodies (8). Thus, the

218

decline of antibody levels does not negate the protective potential because of the importance of

219

cellular responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection. This understanding is corroborated with a

220

recent risk assessment carried out in a cohort of 43,000 convalescent individuals demonstrating

221

that immunity elicited upon natural SARS-CoV-2 infection protects against reinfection with an

222

efficacy of >90% for at least 7 months (34).

223
224

Fc-mediated effector activity of antibodies has been recently shown to correlate with reduced

225

disease severity and mortality (21). Antibodies capable of mediating Fc-dependant functions,

226

such as antibody-dependent phagocytosis and ADCC, have been isolated from convalescent

227

donors (35). Importantly, Fc-mediated effector activity was shown to protect from SARS-CoV-2

228

infection in adapted mice and hamster models (9, 19, 32). Thus, our observations of the

229

persistence of ADCC responses in convalescent plasma up to 8 months PSO suggest that Fc-

230

mediated effector functions could play a vital role in protection from reinfection. Nevertheless, the

231

heterogeneity of immune responses between individuals is and will be an important factor when

232

evaluating the efficacy of immune responses upon re-exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

233
234

A recent study comparing humoral immunity generated by mRNA vaccinees (mRNA-1273 or

235

BNT162b2) and individuals recovered from natural infection observed similarities in antibody

236

binding titers and plasma neutralization capacity (36). Furthermore, this study also observed

237

similar frequencies of RBD-specific memory B cells between vaccinees and infected individuals.

238

Therefore, our results on the persistence of RBD-specific memory B cells up to 8 months after

239

natural infection is reassuring with regards to long-term vaccine efficacy.

Ethics Statement

242

All work was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki in terms of informed

243

consent and approval by an appropriate institutional board. Convalescent plasmas were obtained

244

from donors who consented to participate in this research project at CHUM (19.381). The donors

245

met all donor eligibility criteria: previous confirmed COVID-19 infection and complete resolution

246

of symptoms for at least 14 days.

Plasma and antibodies

249

Plasma from SARS-CoV-2-infected and pre-pandemic uninfected donors were collected, heat-

250

inactivated for 1h at 56°C and stored at -80°C until ready to use in subsequent experiments.

251

Plasma from uninfected donors were used as negative controls and used to calculate the

252

seropositivity threshold in our ELISA, cell-based ELISA, and flow cytometry assays. The RBD-

253

specific monoclonal antibody CR3022 was used as a positive control in our ELISAs, cell-based

254

ELISAs, and flow cytometry assays and was previously described (14, 16, 22). Horseradish

255

peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies able to detect all Ig isotypes (anti-human IgM+IgG+IgA;

256

Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) or specific for the Fc region of human IgG

257

(Invitrogen), the Fc region of human IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, inc.) or the Fc

258

region of human IgA (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, inc) were used as secondary

FreeStyle 293F cells (Invitrogen) were grown in FreeStyle 293F medium (Invitrogen) to a density

279

of 1 x 106 cells/mL at 37°C with 8% CO2 with regular agitation (150 rpm). Cells were transfected

280

with a plasmid coding for SARS-CoV-2 S RBD using ExpiFectamine 293 transfection reagent, as

281

directed by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). One week later, cells were pelleted and discarded.

282

Supernatants were filtered using a 0.22 µm filter (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The recombinant

283

RBD proteins were purified by nickel affinity columns, as directed by the manufacturer

284

(Invitrogen). The RBD preparations were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and

285

stored in aliquots at -80°C until further use. To assess purity, recombinant proteins were loaded

286

on SDS-PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie Blue.

292

4°C. Coated wells were subsequently blocked with blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline [TBS]

293

containing 0.1% Tween20 and 2% BSA) for 1h at room temperature. Wells were then washed

294

four times with washing buffer (Tris-buffered saline [TBS] containing 0.1% Tween20). CR3022

295

mAb (50ng/ml) or a 1/250 dilution of plasma from SARS-CoV-2-infected or uninfected donors

296

were prepared in a diluted solution of blocking buffer (0.1 % BSA) and incubated with the RBD-

297

coated wells for 90 minutes at room temperature. Plates were washed four times with washing

298

buffer followed by incubation with secondary Abs (diluted in blocking buffer,0.4% BSA) for 1h at

299

room temperature, followed by four washes. HRP enzyme activity was determined after the

300

addition of a 1:1 mix of Western Lightning oxidizing and luminol reagents (Perkin Elmer Life

301

Sciences). Light emission was measured with a LB942 TriStar luminometer (Berthold

302

Technologies). Signal obtained with BSA was subtracted for each plasma and was then

303

normalized to the signal obtained with CR3022 mAb present in each plate. The seropositivity

304

threshold was established using the following formula: mean of all COVID-19 negative plasma +

305

(3 standard deviation of the mean of all COVID-19 negative plasma).

306
307

Cell-Based ELISA

308

Detection of the trimeric SARS-CoV-2 Spike at the surface of HOS cells was performed by cell-

309

based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Briefly, parental HOS cells or HOS-Spike

310

cells were seeded in 384-well plates (2.8×104 cells per well) overnight. Cells were blocked with

311

blocking buffer (washing buffer [1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 25 mM Tris (pH 7.5), and 140 mM

312

NaCl] supplemented with 10mg/mL non-fat dry milk and 5mM Tris [pH 8.0]) for 30min. CR3022

313

mAb (1 μg/ml) or plasma from SARS-CoV-2-infected or uninfected donors (at a dilution of 1/250)

314

were prepared in blocking buffer and incubated with the cells for 1h at room temperature.

315

Respective HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were then incubated with the samples for 45

316

min at room temperature. For all conditions, cells were washed 6 times with blocking buffer and

6 times with washing buffer. HRP enzyme activity was determined after the addition of a 1:1 mix

318

of Western Lightning oxidizing and luminol reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Light emission

319

was measured with an LB 942 TriStar luminometer (Berthold Technologies). Signal obtained with

323

all COVID-19 negative plasma).

324
325

Cell surface staining and flow cytometry analysis

326

293T and 293T-Spike cells were mixed at a 1:1 ratio and stained with the anti-RBD CR3022

327

monoclonal Ab (5 μg/ml) or plasma (1:250 dilution). AlexaFluor-647-conjugated goat anti-human

328

IgM+IgG+IgA Abs (1:800 dilution) were used as secondary antibodies. The percentage of

329

transduced cells (GFP+ cells) was determined by gating the living cell population based on

330

viability dye staining (Aqua Vivid, Invitrogen). Samples were acquired on a LSRII cytometer (BD

331

Biosciences) and data analysis was performed using FlowJo v10.7.1 (Tree Star). The

332

seropositivity threshold was established using the following formula: mean of all COVID-19

333

negative plasma + (3 standard deviation of the mean of all COVID-19 negative plasma).

334
335

ADCC assay

336

For evaluation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), parental

337

CEM.NKr CCR5+ cells were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with CEM.NKr. Spike cells. These cells were

338

stained for viability (AquaVivid; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and cellular dyes

339

(cell proliferation dye eFluor670; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and subsequently used as target cells.

340

Overnight rested PBMCs were stained with another cellular marker (cell proliferation dye

341

eFluor450; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and used as effector cells. Stained target and effector cells

342

were mixed at a ratio of 1:10 in 96-well V-bottom plates. Plasma from COVID+ or COVID14

343

individuals (1/500 dilution) or monoclonal antibody CR3022 (1 µg/mL) were added to the

344

appropriate wells. The plates were subsequently centrifuged for 1 min at 300xg, and incubated at

345

37°C, 5% CO2 for 5 hours before being fixed in a 2% PBS-formaldehyde solution. ADCC activity

346

was calculated using the formula: [(% of GFP+ cells in Targets plus Effectors)-(% of GFP+ cells

347

in Targets plus Effectors plus plasma/antibody)]/(% of GFP+ cells in Targets) x 100 by gating on

348

transduced live target cells. All samples were acquired on an LSRII cytometer (BD Biosciences)

349

and data analysis performed using FlowJo v10.7.1 (Tree Star). The specificity threshold was

350

established using the following formula: mean of all COVID-19 negative plasma + (3 standard

351

Virus neutralization assay

354

293T-ACE2 target cells were infected with single-round luciferase-expressing SARS-CoV-2

355

pseudoparticles in presence of convalescent plasma. Briefly, 293T cells were transfected by the

356

calcium phosphate method with the lentiviral vector pNL4.3 R-E- Luc (NIH AIDS Reagent

357

Program) and a plasmid encoding for SARSCoV-2 Spike at a ratio of 5:4. Two days post-

358

transfection, cell supernatants were harvested and stored at -80°C until use. 293T-ACE2 target

359

cells were seeded at a density of 1×104 cells/well in 96-well luminometer-compatible tissue culture

360

plates (Perkin Elmer) 24h before infection. Recombinant viruses in a final volume of 100 µL were

361

incubated with the indicated plasma dilutions (1/50; 1/250; 1/1250; 1/6250; 1/31250) for 1h at

362

37°C and were then added to the target cells followed by incubation for 48h at 37°C; cells were

363

lysed by the addition of 30 µL of passive lysis buffer (Promega) followed by one freeze-thaw cycle.

364

An LB942 TriStar luminometer (Berthold Technologies) was used to measure the luciferase

365

activity of each well after the addition of 100 µL of luciferin buffer (15mM MgSO4, 15mM KPO4

366

[pH 7.8], 1mM ATP, and 1mM dithiothreitol) and 50 µL of 1mM d-luciferin potassium salt (Thermo

367

Fisher Scientific). The neutralization half-maximal inhibitory dilution (ID50) represents the plasma

368

dilution to inhibit 50% of the infection of 293T-ACE2 cells by SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses.

Detection of antigen-specific B cells

371

To detect SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells, we conjugated recombinant RBD proteins with Alexa

372

Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 594 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

373

Approximately 10 x 106 frozen PBMC from 13 convalescent donors were prepared in Falcon®

374

5ml-round bottom polystyrene tubes at a final concentration of 14 x 106 cells/mL in RPMI 1640

375

medium (Gibco by Life Technologies, #11875-093) supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum

376

(Seradigm, #1500-500), Penicillin- Streptomycin (Gibco by Life Technologies, #15140122) and

377

HEPES (Gibco by Life Technologies, #15630-080). After a rest of 2h at 37°C and 5% CO2, cells

378

were stained using Aquavivid viability marker (Gibco by Life Technologies) in DPBS (Gibco by

379

Life Technologies, #14190-144) at 4°C for 20min. The detection of SARS-CoV-2-antigen specific

380

B cells was done by adding the RBD probes to the following antibody cocktail: IgM BUV737 (Clone

381

UCH-B1, #748928), CD24 BUV805 (Clone ML5, #742010), IgG BV421 (Clone G18-145,

386

SJ25C1, #363026) from Biolegend and IgA PE (Clone IS11-8E10 ,#130-113-476) from Miltenyi.

387

Staining was performed at 4°C for 30min and cells were fixed using 2% paraformaldehyde at 4°C

388

for 15min. Stained PBMC samples were acquired on Symphony cytometer (BD Biosciences) and

389

analyzed using FlowJo v10.7.1 (TreeStar). In each experiment, PBMC from unexposed donors

390

(total of n=9) were included to ensure consistent specificity of the assay.

Software scripts and visualization

401

Normalized heatmaps were generated using the complexheatmap, tidyverse, and viridis

402

packages in R and RStudio (37, 38). Normalizations were done per parameter. IDs were grouped

403

and clustered separately according to time point. Correlograms were generated using the corrplot

404

and RColorBrewer packages in program R and RStudio using hierarchical clustering according

405

to the first principal component (FPC). Circular barplots were generated in R and RStudio using

406

the tidyverse package with averaged, normalized data per parameter and time point. Edge

407

bundling graphs were generated in undirected mode in R and RStudio using ggraph, igraph,

408

tidyverse, and RColorBrewer packages. Edges are only shown if p < 0.05, and nodes are sized

409

according to the connecting edges’ r values. Nodes are color-coded according to groups of

410

parameters. Area graphs were generated for the display of normalized time series. The plots were

411

created in RawGraphs using DensityDesign interpolation and vertically un-centered values (39).

Figure 1. Decline of RBD- and Spike-specific antibodies in longitudinal convalescent plasma.
(A-D) Indirect ELISA was performed using recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein and incubation with COVID-19+ plasma samples
recovered between 6 and 31 weeks post-symptom onset. Anti-RBD antibody binding was detected using HRP-conjugated (A) anti-human
IgM+IgG+IgA (B) anti-human IgM , (C) anti-human IgG, or (D) anti-human IgA. Relative light unit (RLU) values obtained with BSA (negative
control) were subtracted and further normalized to the signal obtained with the anti-RBD CR3022 mAb present in each plate. (E-H)
Cell-based ELISA was performed using HOS cells expressing full-length SARS-CoV-2 Spike and incubation with COVID-19+ plasma
samples recovered between 6 and 31 weeks post-symptom onset. Anti-Spike antibody binding was detected using HRP-conjugated (E)
anti-human IgM+IgG+IgA (F) anti-human IgM, (G) anti-human IgG, or (H) anti-human IgA. RLU values obtained with parental HOS (negative control) were subtracted and further normalized to the signal obtained with the CR3022 mAb present in each plate. (Left panels) Each
curve represents the normalized RLUs obtained with the plasma of one donor at every donation as a function of the days after symptom
onset. (Right panels) Plasma samples were grouped in different timepoints post-symptom onset (6, 11, 21 and 31 weeks). Undetectable
measures are represented as white symbols, and limits of detection are plotted. Error bars indicate means ± SEM. Statistical significance
was tested using repeated measures one-way ANOVA with a Holm-Sidak post-test (* P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01; *** P < 0.001; **** P < 0.0001).

Figure 2. Neutralization and Fc-effector function activities in convalescent plasma decrease over time.
(A) Pseudoviral particles coding for the luciferase reporter gene and bearing the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoproteins were used
to infect 293T-ACE2 cells. Neutralizing activity was measured by incubating pseudoviruses with serial dilutions of
COVID-19+ plasma samples recovered between 6 and 31 weeks post-symptom onset at 37°C for 1 h prior to infection of
293T-ACE2 cells. Neutralization half maximal inhibitory serum dilution (ID50) values were determined using a normalized
non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism software. (B) CEM.NKr parental cells were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with
CEM.NKr-Spike cells and were used as target cells. PBMCs from uninfected donors were used as effector cells in a
FACS-based ADCC assay. The graphs shown represent the percentages of ADCC obtained in the presence of
COVID-19+ plasma samples recovered between 6 and 31 weeks post-symptom onset. (Left panels) Each curve represents (A) the neutralization ID50 or (B) the percentages of ADCC obtained with the plasma of one donor at every donation
as a function of the days after symptom onset. (Right panels) Plasma samples were grouped in different timepoints
post-symptom onset (6, 11, 21 and 31 weeks). Undetectable measures are represented as white symbols, and limits of
detection are plotted. Error bars indicate means ± SEM. Statistical significance was tested using repeated measures

Figure 3. RBD-specific memory B cells develop and persist up to 8 months post-symptom onset.
(A) Flow cytometry plots of staining with fluorescent SARS-CoV-2 RBD probes on CD19+ CD20+ HLA-DR+ B cells.
Samples from one representative convalescent donor are shown for 4 different timepoints post-symptom onset (6, 11, 21
and 31 weeks). All percentages shown represent the frequency of RBD-specific B cells on the total CD19+ CD20+ B cell
population. (B-G) Characterization of RBD-specific B cells was performed on longitudinal PBMC samples obtained from
COVID-19+ convalescent individuals between 6 and 31 weeks post-symptom onset. (B) Total RBD-specific B cells were
segregated by subsets based on cell surface expression of (C) IgM, (D) IgG or (E) IgA BCR isotypes. Frequency of (F) total
memory, (G) naïve, (H) IgG+ memory and (I) IgA+ memory B cells were determined based on CD21 and CD27 expression.
(Left panels) Each curve represents the frequency of a B cell subset on the total B cell population obtained with PBMCs from
one donor at every donation as a function of the days after symptom onset. (Right panels) PBMC samples were grouped in
different timepoints post-symptom onset (6, 11, 21 and 31 weeks). Error bars indicate means ± SEM. Statistical significance
was tested using repeated measures one-way ANOVA with a Holm-Sidak post-test (* P < 0.05; ns, nonsignificant)

Supplemental Figure 5. Correlations between serological, immunological and demographic determinants.
Correlograms were generated by plotting together all serological, immunological and demographic data obtained
from convalescent patients. Circles are color-coded and sized according to the magnitude of the correlation coefficient (r). Red circles represent positive correlations between two variables and blue circles represent negative
correlations. Asterisks indicate statistically significant correlations (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.005). Correlation
analysis was done using Spearman correlation rank tests. Parameters are clustered hierarchically according to the
first principal component (FPC). Black surrounding boxes indicate adjusted p-values < 0.05 using Benjamini-Hochberg multiplicity correction. Legend: Cb-ELISA = cell-based ELISA, Neut = Neutralization, mem = memory, PSO =
post-symptom onset, Sex = Female.
