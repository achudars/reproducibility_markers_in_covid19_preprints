ABSTRACT

27

Although neutralizing antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein are a goal of

28

COVID-19 vaccines and have received emergency use authorization as therapeutics, viral escape

29

mutants could compromise their efficacy. To define the immune-selected mutational landscape in

30

S protein, we used a VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2-S chimeric virus and 19 neutralizing monoclonal

31

antibodies (mAbs) against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) to generate 50 different escape

32

mutants. The variants were mapped onto the RBD structure and evaluated for cross-resistance

33

to mAbs and convalescent human sera. Each mAb had a unique resistance profile, although many

34

shared residues within an epitope. Some variants (e.g., S477N) were resistant to neutralization

35

by multiple mAbs, whereas others (e.g., E484K) escaped neutralization by convalescent sera,

36

suggesting some humans induce a narrow repertoire of neutralizing antibodies. Comparing the

37

antibody-mediated mutational landscape in S with sequence variation in circulating SARS-CoV-

38

2, we define substitutions that may attenuate neutralizing immune responses in some humans.

INTRODUCTION

41

Control of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will require deployment of multiple

42

countermeasures including therapeutics and vaccines. Therapeutic candidates that have

43

received emergency use authorization (EUA) or are in development include several monoclonal

44

antibodies (mAbs) (Chen et al., 2020; Group et al., 2020; Weinreich et al., 2020) that recognize

45

the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which decorates the virion surface (Ke et al., 2020). The S

46

protein is comprised of an N-terminal subunit (S1) that mediates receptor binding and a C-terminal

47

subunit (S2) responsible for virus-cell membrane fusion (Wrapp et al., 2020). During viral entry

48

into cells, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1 engages the primary receptor, human

49

angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) (Letko et al., 2020). Processing of S by host cell

50

proteases, typically TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, or endosomal cathepsins, facilitates the S2-

51

dependent fusion of viral and host-cell membranes (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Zang et al., 2020).

52

Potently neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 target the RBD (Brouwer et al., 2020; Group

53

et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b; Zost et al., 2020) with many inhibiting infection

54

by blocking receptor engagement (Alsoussi et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b). Understanding the

55

epitopes recognized by protective antibodies and whether natural variation in the S protein is

56

associated with resistance to neutralization may predict the utility of antibody-based

57

countermeasures.

58

RNA viruses exist as a swarm or “quasispecies” of genome sequences around a core

59

consensus sequence (Dolan et al., 2018). Under conditions of selection, such as those imposed

60

by neutralizing antibodies or drugs, variants of the swarm can escape genetically and become

61

resistant. The relative fitness of escape mutants determines whether they are lost rapidly from

62

the swarm or provide a competitive advantage. The intrinsically high error rates of viral RNA-

63

dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) result in the stochastic introduction of mutations during viral

64

genome replication with substitutions approaching a nucleotide change per genome for each

65

round of replication (Sanjuan et al., 2010). Coronaviruses, because of their large genome size,

3

66

encode a proofreading 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN, nsp14) that helps to correct errors made

67

by the RdRp during replication (Smith and Denison, 2013). As a result of ExoN activity, the

68

frequency of escape from antibody neutralization by coronaviruses is less than for other RNA

69

viruses lacking such an enzyme (Smith et al., 2013).

70

To date, 4150 mutations have been identified in the S gene of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from

71

humans (CoV-GLUE, 2021; GISAID, 2021). These mutations give rise to 1,246 amino acid

72

changes including 187 substitutions in the RBD. The abundance of many variants in the human

73

population suggests they are not accompanied by a fitness loss. Multiple mechanisms likely

74

account for the emergence of such substitutions including host adaptation, immune selection

75

during natural infection, and possibly reinfection of individuals with incomplete or waning

76

immunity. Convalescent plasma therapy, vaccination, and administration of therapeutic

77

antibodies each could select for additional variants, and their effectiveness as countermeasures

78

might be compromised by preexisting resistant mutants. Thus, as therapeutic antibodies and

79

vaccines are deployed, it is increasingly important to define the patterns of antibody resistance

80

that arise. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 adaptation for infection of other hosts including mice

81

(Dinnon et al., 2020; Gu et al., 2020), mink (Oude Munnink et al., 2020) and domesticated animals

82

(Halfmann et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020) could also contribute to selection of new variants.

83

Here, we used a panel of antibodies including the previously reported 2B04, 1B07 and

84

2H04 mAbs (Alsoussi et al., 2020) and newly-generated neutralizing mAbs against SARS-CoV-2

85

RBD to select for escape variants and define the mutational landscape of resistance. To facilitate

86

selection, we used a chimeric, infectious vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in which the endogenous

87

glycoprotein was replaced with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Case et al., 2020). VSV-eGFP-

88

SARS-CoV-2-SΔ21 (herein, VSV-SARS-CoV-2) replicates to high titer (107-108 plaque forming

89

units ml-1 within 48 hours), mimics the SARS-CoV-2 requirement for human ACE2 as a receptor,

90

and is neutralized by SARS-CoV-2 S-specific mAbs (Case et al., 2020). In three selection

91

campaigns using 19 different mAbs, we isolated 50 different escape mutants within the RBD.

92

Many escape mutations arose proximal to or within the ACE2 binding footprint suggesting that

93

multiple neutralizing mAbs inhibit infection by interfering with receptor engagement. Cross-

94

neutralization studies involving 29 of the escape mutants and 10 mAbs identified mutants that

95

were resistant to multiple antibodies and also those with unique resistance profiles. Remarkably,

96

substitutions at residue E484 of S protein were associated with resistance to neutralization by

97

polyclonal human immune sera, suggesting that some individuals generate neutralizing

98

antibodies recognizing a focused target on the RBD. Resistance to inhibition by soluble

99

recombinant human ACE2, a candidate decoy molecule drug (Chan et al., 2020; Monteil et al.,

100

2020) currently in clinical trials (NCT04375046, NCT04287686), was observed with an F486S

101

substitution. Cross-referencing of our 50 resistant mutants with sequences of clinical isolates of

102

SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates that some already circulating variants will be resistant to monoclonal

103

and polyclonal antibodies. This data and functional approach may be useful for monitoring and

104

evaluating the emergence of escape from antibody-based therapeutic and vaccine

105

countermeasures as they are deployed.

RESULTS

108

Selection of mAb escape mutants in SARS-CoV-2 S.

109

To select for SARS-CoV-2 S variants that escape neutralization, we used VSV-SARS-

110

CoV-2 (Case et al., 2020) and mAb 2B04, which was generated from cloned murine B cells

111

following immunization of C57BL/6 mice with recombinant RBD and boosted with recombinant S.

112

Antibody neutralization resistant mutants were recovered by plaque isolation (Fig 1A), and their

113

resistance was verified by subsequent virus infection in the presence or absence of antibody.

114

Antibody 2B04 failed to inhibit VSV-SARS-CoV-2 resistant variants as judged by plaque number

115

and size (Fig 1B). Sequence analysis identified the mutations E484A, E484K, and F486S (Fig

116

1B), each of which fall within the RBD and map to residues involved in ACE2 binding (Lan et al.,

117

2020) (Fig 2).

118

We extended this neutralization escape approach to nine additional inhibitory mAbs (Fig

119

S1, S2 and Table 1). Sequence analysis of each isolated plaque identified multiple mutations

120

within the RBD (Table 2), which we positioned on the reported crystal structure (PDB: 6M0J) (Fig

121

2): 2B04 (green), 2H04 (lime), 1B07 (blue), SARS2-01 (yellow), SARS2-02 (teal), SARS2-07

122

(tangerine), SARS2-16 (violet), SARS2-19 (red), SARS2-32 (fuschia), and SARS2-38 (magenta).

123

Substitutions that led to resistance of mAbs 2B04, 1B07, SARS2-02, SARS2-07, SARS2-16,

124

SARS2-32, and SARS2-38 cluster within and proximal to the ACE2 binding site. Resistance to

125

antibodies SARS2-01 and SARS2-19 mapped to substitutions at sites on the side of the RBD (Fig

126

2). MAb 2H04 gave rise to resistance mutations that map exclusively on the side and base of the

127

RBD (Fig 2). The identification of resistance mutations at the side of the RBD suggest that the

128

mechanism of virus neutralization may be allosteric or possibly through blocking interactions with

129

alternative attachment factors. The presence of resistance mutations at the base of RBD, which

130

lie outside the 2H04 binding footprints, suggests an allosteric mechanism of resistance, perhaps

131

related to the ability of the RBD to adopt the ‘up’ conformation requisite for ACE2 binding.

132

From this panel of mAbs, we observed resistance substitutions at shared positions. Four

133

mAbs yielded substitutions at E484 (2B04, 1B07, SARS2-02, and SARS2-32), three resulted in

134

changes to residues G446 (SARS2-02, SARS2-32, and SARS2-38) and S477 (SARS2-07,

135

SARS2-16 and SARS2-19), and two promoted escape substitutions at F486 (2B04 and 1B07),

136

K444 (2H04 and SARS2-38), L452 (SARS2-01 and SARS2-32), and N450 (SARS2-07 and

137

SARS2-32), and R346 (2H04 and SARS2-01). The overlapping nature of these epitopes suggests

138

they represent major antigenic sites within the RBD. Although amino acid changes were selected

139

at the same position, many of the substitutions were distinct, consistent with a unique mode of

140

binding for each antibody.

141

Two mAbs gave rise to variants containing linked amino acid substitutions: 2H04 (T345A

142

and L517R) and SARS2-19 (S477N and S514F). For 2H04, substitution T345A likely arose first,

143

as we isolated this mutation alone, and acquisition of the L517R substitution appeared to enhance

144

infectivity as judged by plaque morphology (Fig S2). For SARS2-19, S477N was isolated as a

145

single variant suggesting that this substitution arose first, however acquisition of the S514F did

146

not alter plaque morphology (Fig S2). As the L517R or S514F substitutions were not identified in

147

isolation, it remains unclear whether they cause resistance to 2H04 or SARS2-19 respectively.

148

Collectively, these results show that escape mutational profiling can identify key epitopes and

149

dominant antigenic sites.

150

Escape mutants confer cross-resistance to multiple mAbs.

151

We next evaluated whether individual mutants could escape neutralization by the other

152

inhibitory mAbs in the panel. We tested the 29 identified escape mutants for neutralization by ten

153

different mAbs. We defined the degree of resistance as a percentage by expressing the number

154

of plaques formed by each mutant in the presence or absence of antibody. We plotted the degree

155

of resistance to neutralization as a heat map and arbitrarily set 50% as the cut-off value for

156

defining resistance (Fig 3A). Substitutions at residues T345, R346, K444, G446, N450, L452,

157

S477, T478, E484, F486 and P499 each were associated with resistance to more than one mAb,

7

158

with substitutions at S477 and E484 exhibiting broad resistance (Fig 3A). For residues at which

159

multiple alternate amino acids with different side chains were selected, each particular substitution

160

was associated with a unique resistance profile. For example, K444E was resistant to SARS2-38

161

and 2H04 with some resistance to SARS2-1, SARS2-2 and SARS2-7, whereas K444N conferred

162

complete resistance to SARS2-38, partial resistance to 2H04 and only weak resistance to SARS2-

163

1 and SARS2-2. G446D was resistant to SARS2-2, SARS2-32 and SARS2-38, but G446V

164

acquired resistance to SARS2-01. Substitutions N450K and N450Y were resistant to SARS2-01

165

and SARS2-32, whereas N450D facilitated resistance to SARS2-07. Substitution L452R

166

conferred resistance to SARS2-01, SARS2-02, and SARS2-32; S477N, S477G and S477R were

167

each highly resistant to SARS2-07, SARS2-16, and SARS2-19, and S477N and S477G result in

168

a degree of resistance across the entire panel of antibodies; and T478I yielded resistance to

169

SARS2-16 and SARS2-19.

170

Escape variants at residue E484 were isolated using 2B04, 1B07, SARS2-02, and

171

SARS2-32, and specific substitutions at this residue led to varying degrees of resistance across

172

the entire panel of antibodies. E484A exhibited a high degree of resistance to 2B04, 1B07,

173

SARS2-01, SARS2-07, SARS2-19, SARS2-32, SARS2-38; E484G exhibited resistance to 2B04,

174

1B07, SARS2-01, SARS2-32 and SARS2-38; E484K was resistant to 2B04, 1B07, SARS2-01,

175

SARS2-02, SARS2-16 and SARS2-32; and E484D was resistant only to 1B07 (Fig 3A and S3).

176

Substitution F486S was resistant to 2B04, 1B07, SARS2-07, SARS2-16 and SARS2-19, whereas

177

F486Y exhibited resistance only to 1B07 and SARS2-16. Finally, substitution P499L was resistant

178

to SARS2-07, SARS2-16, and SARS2-19. In addition to demonstrating that some mutations

179

confer resistance to multiple neutralizing mAbs, these data suggest that each mAb recognizes

180

distinct yet partially overlapping epitopes.

Soluble human ACE2-Fc receptor decoy inhibition of escape mutants.

182

Soluble human ACE2 decoy receptors are under evaluation in clinical trials for treatment

183

of COVID-19 (NCT04375046 and NCT04287686). As several of the escape mutants contain

184

substitutions within or proximal to the ACE2 binding site, we evaluated the ability of soluble

185

recombinant ACE2 to inhibit infection of each variant. We incubated each VSV-SARS-CoV-2

186

mutant with increasing concentrations of soluble human (h) or murine (m) ACE2-Fc for 1 h at

187

37°C and measured residual infectivity on Vero E6 cells (Fig 3B and S4). As observed with

188

chimeric viruses expressing the wild-type S protein, the escape mutants were inhibited by hACE2-

189

Fc but not mACE2-Fc. However, the extent of neutralization by hACE2-Fc varied substantially

190

(Fig 3B), with some mutants more sensitive to receptor inhibition and others exhibiting relative

191

resistance. Substitutions at residues R346, A352, N450, S477, S494 and P499 were more

192

sensitive to inhibition by soluble hACE2 than the wild-type S as evidenced by reduced IC50 values

193

(Fig 3B) and leftward shifts of the inhibition curves (Fig S4). This effect was substitution-

194

dependent, as N450K was 6-fold more sensitive to hACE2 than N450Y (P < 0.001). Several

195

mutants required higher (3-5-fold) concentrations of hACE2 to block infection, including

196

substitutions at T345A, T345N, G446D, G446V, E484D and F486Y. Again, the specific

197

substitution of a given residue impacted the effect, as T345A and T345N required higher

198

concentrations of hACE2 to inhibit infection, whereas T345S was similar to wild type. Of the 4

199

substitutions observed at position E484, only E484D was less sensitive (4.6-fold, P < 0.0001) to

200

hACE2 inhibition. The most striking effect was observed for F486S, where we achieved only 38%

201

inhibition at the highest concentration (20 µg/ml) of hACE2-Fc tested (Fig 3B and C). Residue

202

F486 is located on the top of the hACE2 contact loop of RBD, and the presence of a large

203

hydrophobic residue facilitates efficient receptor engagement (Lan et al., 2020; Shang et al.,

204

2020). Although this substitution alters sensitivity to soluble ACE2 inhibition of infection, its impact

205

on cell surface ACE2 engagement by virus was not examined.

206

Escape mutants exhibit resistance to neutralization by polyclonal human immune sera.

207

We previously evaluated the ability of convalescent sera from SARS-CoV-2-infected

208

humans to neutralize VSV-SARS-CoV-2 and defined a strong correlation with inhibition of a

209

clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 using a focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT) (Case et al.,

9

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.06.372037; this version posted January 11, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

210

2020). We tested four of the serum samples (13, 29, 35 and 37) from patients who had recovered

211

from COVID-19 against our panel of escape mutants (Table 3). All four sera neutralized infection

212

of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S displaying the wild-type S protein as we previously demonstrated.

213

Remarkably, several of the escape mutants were resistant to neutralization at the highest

214

concentration (1:80 initial dilution) of sera tested. All four of the substitutions at residue E484 were

215

resistant to each of the four sera, suggesting that this is part of a dominant neutralizing epitope.

216

Indeed, change at E484 was the only position that led to escape from sera 29 (Fig 4A-B, and

217

S5A). Four other substitutions (K444E, G446V, L452R and F490S) resulted in resistance to

218

neutralization of sera 13, 35 and 37 (Fig 4A and S5A). Substitutions N450D and N450Y but not

219

N450K were resistant to sera 13 and 35. Sera 13 and 35 also did not efficiently neutralize S477G,

220

L441R, and T478I. All four sera neutralized the single substitution S477N as well as wild-type

221

virus (Fig 4A-B). Substitution S477N was sensitive to neutralization by sera 13 and 35 except in

222

the presence of a second S514F substitution (Fig 4A and S5A). Additional amino acid

223

substitutions that conferred resistance to serum 13 include T345S and G446D. Substitution

224

F486S, which altered sensitivity to soluble ACE2, escaped neutralization by serum 35 but not 13,

225

29 or 37. We consistently noticed that some sera also led to an increase in infectivity of specific

226

escape mutants (e.g., E484A) at some concentrations (Fig 4B). The significance of this increase

227

is unclear, but was observed consistently across sera for several mutants (Fig S5A).

228

To extend these findings, we employed a higher throughput screening assay to test 16

229

additional human sera (11, 15, 16, 18, 21, 23, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 37, 38 and 39) for their

230

ability to neutralize the VSV-SARS-CoV-2 mutants N450Y, S477N, E484A, E484D and E484K

231

(Table 3). Although we observed neutralization of the various mutants at the highest

232

concentrations of human sera tested (1:10), VSV-SARS-CoV-2 variants with substitutions at

233

residues 484 were consistently less sensitive to neutralization by all sera (Fig 4C and S5B). Thus,

234

individual escape mutants can exhibit resistance to neutralization by polyclonal human

235

convalescent sera. This observation suggests that the repertoire of antigenic sites on RBD that

10

236

bind neutralizing antibodies is limited in some humans. We again observed the increase in

237

infectivity of substitutions at residue E484 in the presence of multiple human sera (Fig S5B).

238

Comparison of escape mutants with S sequence variants isolated in humans.

239

To broaden our analysis, we performed a second campaign of escape mutant selection

240

using nine additional neutralizing mAbs generated against the RBD (Fig 5, S6, S7 and Table 2).

241

This effort generated 19 additional escape mutants, bringing the total to 48. To determine whether

242

any of the 48 escape mutants we isolated represent S protein variants circulating in humans, we

243

compiled all publically available genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2. Using 323,183 genomes

244

from GISAID, we calculated the substitution frequencies throughout RBD protein (Fig 6A) and

245

mapped the identified residues onto RBD structure (Fig 6B). Of the 48 escape variants we

246

selected, 32 are present in circulating human isolates of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 6A). The most

247

frequent S sequence variant seen in clinical isolates is D614G which is present in 69% of

248

sequenced isolates. The fourth most frequent substitution is S477N, which is present in 4.6% of

249

sequenced isolates and the dominant virus in Oceana. The penetrance of the remaining

250

substitutions among clinical isolates is relatively low, with G446V, T478I, E484K, S477I and

251

S494P ranking 79, 102, 123, 135 and 146 of the top 150 variants in S or roughly 0.05% of

252

sequenced variants. Collectively, this analysis highlights that neutralizing mAbs against RBD can

253

select for variants or changes at positions that already exist within the human population and

254

establishes that some substitutions are present at high frequency.

255

Sequential selection of 2B04 and 2H04 escape mutants

256

To examine whether mutations resistant to antibody combinations could be isolated, we

257

undertook a third selection campaign using a combination of 2B04 and 2H04. We were unable to

258

isolate mutants resistant to the two antibodies when added concurrently. However, using the 2B04

259

resistant-viruses E484A, E484K and F486S, we selected additional mutations by growth in the

260

presence of 2H04 (Fig 7 and Table 2). These selected variants were resistant to both antibodies.

261

For the 2B04 resistant mutant E484A, we selected T345A, R346G and K444E; for mutant E484K,

262

we isolated R346K, A372T and K444E; and for mutant F486S we selected T345S. Two of the

263

mutants (R346K and A372T) were not seen in our prior selection campaigns with 2H04 alone,

264

although both variants exist in human isolates (Fig 6). Taken together, this analysis suggests that

265

cocktails of mAbs binding distinct epitopes on SARS-CoV-2 S protein pose an increased but not

266

complete barrier to resistance, especially if circulating strains already encode substitutions that

267

compromise effectiveness of one of the two mAbs.

DISCUSSION

270

Therapeutic mAbs, convalescent plasma and vaccines are in clinical development as

271

countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2. The efficacy of these strategies will be impacted by viral

272

mutants that escape antibody binding and neutralization. To define the landscape of mutations in

273

the RBD associated with resistance, we selected escape mutants to 19 neutralizing mAbs

274

including some in clinical development. Characterization of escape mutants identified several that

275

exhibit resistance to multiple antibodies, convalescent human sera, and soluble receptor decoys.

276

Resistance to neutralization by serum from naturally-infected humans suggests that the

277

neutralizing response to SARS-CoV-2 in some individuals may be dominated by antibodies that

278

recognize relatively few epitopes. Many of the escape mutants we identified contain substitutions

279

in residues at which variation is observed in circulating human isolates of SARS-CoV-2. If a similar

280

limited polyclonal response occurs following S protein-based vaccination, escape variants could

281

emerge in the human population and compromise the efficacy of such vaccines.

282

From 19 different mAbs that neutralize SARS-CoV-2, we isolated 50 viral mutants that

283

escape neutralization. Selection of escape mutants was facilitated by the use of VSV-SARS-CoV-

284

2, which we previously validated as an effective mimic of SARS-CoV-2 S protein mediated

285

infection (Case et al., 2020). The mAbs were obtained following immunization with soluble RBD,

286

and although some mice received a boost with stabilized S ectodomain protein, all escape

287

substitutions map within the RBD. Multiple different mAbs led to resistance substitutions at K444,

288

G446, N450, L452, S477, T478, P479, E484, F486 and P499, suggesting that they comprise

289

major antigenic sites within the RBD. In earlier work, substitutions at residues K444, N450, E484

290

and F486 were identified using two antibodies in clinical development (Group et al., 2020), and a

291

separate study using three different antibodies defined resistance substitutions at R346, N440,

292

E484, F490 and Q493 (Greaney et al., 2020; Weisblum et al., 2020).

293

The mutations we selected also inform the mechanism by which the different antibodies

294

function. All of the resistance mutations we identified map within or proximal to the ACE2 binding

13

295

site. Likely, the majority of the antibodies we tested neutralize infection by interfering with receptor

296

engagement. Antibodies from human survivors also interfere with receptor engagement (Wu et

297

al., 2020b; Zost et al., 2020) suggesting a common mechanism of neutralization. Some of the

298

resistance mutations from 2H04, SARS2-01 and SARS2-31 we identified map outside the ACE2

299

binding site including at the side and the base of the RBD. Direct competition with ACE2 binding

300

is consistent with the escape mutants we selected with 2B04, whereas an indirect mechanism of

301

action fits with the escape mutants we identified to 2H04. Our finding of an escape mutant to 2H04

302

located at the base of the RBD, outside the footprint of the antibody, suggests a possible allosteric

303

mechanism of resistance. This mutation might affect the ability of the RBD to adopt the ‘up’

304

conformation necessary for engagement of the cellular receptors perhaps by shielding the epitope

305

or stabilizing the RBD in the ‘down’ conformation. Further structural and functional work is

306

required to define how different mutations promote antibody resistance and determine the

307

mechanisms by which specific antibodies inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.

308

The relatively low genetic barrier to resistance combined with knowledge of the presence

309

of relevant substitutions in clinical isolates suggests that effective mAb therapy likely will require

310

a combination of at least two neutralizing antibodies (Baum et al., 2020; Du et al., 2020; Greaney

311

et al., 2020; Group et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Weisblum et al., 2020). Profiling whether different

312

residues are associated with resistance to specific antibodies could facilitate the selection of

313

combinations based on their non-overlapping resistance mutations. Although we isolated several

314

escape mutants that exhibit cross-resistance to multiple antibodies, other antibodies are

315

associated with unique and non-overlapping resistance. Resistance to such combinations could

316

still arise through sequential escape whereby a resistant variant to one antibody acquires

317

resistance to a second. Sequential escape could be favored in vivo for two antibodies with

318

different half-lives, or when a pre-existing resistant variant to one antibody already is circulating.

319

Indeed, while we could not generate escape mutants to the antibody cocktail of 2B04 and 2H04,

320

we readily isolated escape mutants to both mAbs through sequential selection.

321

Substitution S477N, the fourth most abundant S protein sequence variant in circulating

322

human isolates of SARS-CoV-2, led to a degree of resistance to all of the mAbs we profiled,

323

including 2B04 and 2H04. How S477N could confer such broad resistance is of interest, given its

324

penetrance among clinical isolates (6.5%). One possible explanation may relate to changes in

325

glycosylation at this position. Additional analysis is required to determine how broad the

326

resistance associated with S477N is, and to probe the mechanism by which it occurs. The broad

327

mAb resistance observed here for S477N was not accompanied by resistance to neutralization

328

by human convalescent sera, suggesting that other epitopes – such as those centered around

329

E484 are more dominant in humans. Among our panel of mutants, we isolated a total of 14

330

substitutions at sites of glycosylation, including 8 N-linked glycans site: T345N, K444N, S477N,

331

L441R, L517R, L452R, S477R, K444R; and 6 O-linked glycans: F486S, T345S, F490S, P479S;

332

F486Y, N450Y.

333

Substitutions at position E484 were associated with relative resistance to neutralization by

334

several convalescent human sera. Four variants at this position (E484A, E484D, E484G and

335

E484K) exhibited resistance to each of the human convalescent sera we tested. This suggests

336

that in some humans, neutralizing antibodies may be directed toward a narrow repertoire of

337

epitopes following natural infection. Substitution at position E484 has become increasingly

338

common among clinical isolates. As of October 2020, just 0.03% of sequenced isolates exhibited

339

variation at E484, which led us to suspect that variation at this position may come with an apparent

340

fitness cost for viral replication. However, by January of 2021, the prevalence of substitutions at

341

this position had increased to 0.09%. Substitution E484K is likely to increase in penetrance further

342

as it linked together with N501Y and K417N changes that are present in variant 501.V2, which is

343

believed to be more transmissible (Tegally et al., 2020). The relative resistance of the

344

substitutions at E484 to the human sera tested highlight how variants at even a single position

345

can affect neutralization. Given the apparent limited breadth of the human neutralizing antibody

346

response to natural infection, it will be important to define the epitope repertoire following

15

347

vaccination and develop strategies that broaden neutralizing antibody responses. In this regard,

348

the 50 viral mutants described here, combined with additional mutants reported in related studies

349

(Greaney et al., 2020; Group et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Weisblum et al., 2020), provide a

350

compendium of functionally relevant S protein variants that could be used to profile sera from

351

vaccine recipients in existing clinical trials.

352

Among the escape variants we selected, there were several that altered susceptibility to

353

neutralization by soluble ACE2. Substitution F486S was particularly notable, as we were unable

354

to attain 50% neutralization at the highest concentrations of soluble hACE2 tested (>20 µg/ml).

355

The finding of an antibody escape mutant mapping to a critical residue within the ACE2 binding

356

site raises questions regarding possible receptor usage by viruses containing S proteins with

357

F486S. Future studies that introduce F486S into an infectious cDNA clone of SARS-CoV-2 are

358

needed to determine the significance of this change to hACE2 interactions in vivo. The escape

359

variants we selected were also examined for their sensitivity to neutralization by soluble mACE2.

360

For the wild type S sequence and some escape mutants (e.g., L441R, K444N, L452R, and

361

S477N), we observed a modest increase in infectivity at increasing concentration of soluble

362

mACE2. Further studies using the infectious molecular clone of SARS-CoV-2 will be required to

363

discern the significance of this observation.

364

We did not directly address the fitness of the mutants generated in this study, and any

365

studies of the fitness of the VSV-SARS-CoV-2 variants would pertain to their relative replicative

366

fitness measured in cell culture (Domingo et al., 2012). We can, however, make several

367

inferences about fitness of specific viral mutants based on the prevalence of the corresponding

368

mutants among circulating human isolates of SARS-CoV-2. Over 60% of the mutants we isolated

369

in this study already circulate as natural viral variants. The escape mutants we isolated were

370

based on single nucleotide changes starting from the sequence of the S protein of the SARS-

371

CoV-2 Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (Wu et al., 2020a). In the context of VSV-SARS-CoV-2, the fitness of

372

the variants in cell culture relates to their ability to resist neutralization by the indicated mAb and

373

infect Vero cells presumably through interactions with ACE2. Our functional screens complement

374

other systematic mutational analyses of the amino acid residues of the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2

375

S, such as those based on yeast display (Starr et al., 2020).

376

Limitations of this study

377

Use of chimeric VSV that depends on SARS-CoV-2 S protein for entry into cells enabled

378

the selection of 50 escape mutants. Although chimeric VSV serves as an effective mimic of SARS-

379

CoV-2 S protein-mediated entry and viral neutralization, sequence analysis of circulating human

380

isolates revealed that 34 of those escape mutants are present in the context of infectious SARS-

381

CoV-2. The remaining 16 variants may represent S sequences with compromised fitness in the

382

background of SARS-CoV-2 highlighting one potential limitation of our work. Additional limitations

383

of our study are the relatively limited number of polyclonal human sera that we profiled against

384

the panel of escape mutants. Additional human sera samples at lower dilutions may help

385

determine the extent to which serum-based neutralization of virus is affected by individual or

386

combinations of escape mutants.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS

540

Cells. Cells were cultured in humidified incubators at 34° or 37°C and 5% CO2 in the

541

indicated media. Vero CCL81, Vero E6 and Vero E6-TMPRSS2 were maintained in DMEM

542

(Corning or VWR) supplemented with glucose, L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal

543

bovine serum (FBS). MA104 cells were propagated in Medium 199 (Gibco) containing 10% FBS.

544

Vero E6-TMPRSS2 cells were generated using a lentivirus vector described as previously (Case

545

et al., 2020).

546

VSV-SARS-CoV-2 mutants. Plaque assays were performed to isolate the VSV-SARS-

547

CoV-2 escape mutant on Vero E6-TMPRSS2 cells with the indicated mAb in the overlay. The

548

concentration of mAb in the overlay was determined by neutralization assays at a multiplicity of

549

infection (MOI) of 100. Escape clones were plaque-purified on Vero-E6 TMPRSS2 cells in the

550

presence of mAb, and plaques in agarose plugs were amplified on MA104 cells with the mAb

551

present in the medium. Viral stocks were amplified on MA104 cells at an MOI of 0.01 in Medium

552

199 containing 2% FBS and 20 mM HEPES pH 7.7 (Millipore Sigma) at 34°C. Viral supernatants

553

were harvested upon extensive cytopathic effect and clarified of cell debris by centrifugation at

554

1,000 x g for 5 min. Aliquots were maintained at -80°C.

555

Mouse experiments. Animal studies were carried out in accordance with the

556

recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National

557

Institutes of Health. The protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use

558

Committee at the Washington University School of Medicine (Assurance number A3381-01).

559

Virus inoculations were performed under anesthesia that was induced and maintained with

560

ketamine hydrochloride and xylazine, and all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering.

561

Female BALB/c mice (catalog 000651) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.

562
563

METHOD DETAILS

564

Sequencing of the S gene. Viral RNA was extracted from VSV-SARS-CoV-2 mutant

565

viruses using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), and S was amplified using OneStep RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen).

566

The mutations were identified by Sanger sequencing (GENEWIZ).

567

Plaque assays. Plaque assays were performed on Vero and Vero E6-TMPRSS2 cells.

568

Briefly, cells were seeded into 6 or 12 well plates for overnight. Virus was serially diluted using

569

DMEM and cells were infected at 37°C for 1 h. Cells were cultured with an agarose overlay in the

570

presence of Ab or absence of Ab at 34°C for 2 days. Plates were scanned on a biomolecular

571

imager and expression of eGFP is show at 48 hours post-infection.

572
573

Protein expression and purification. Soluble hACE2-Fc and mACE2-Fc were
generated and purified as described as previously (Case et al., 2020).

574

Monoclonal antibodies. mAbs 2B04, 1B07 and 2H04 were described previously

575

(Alsoussi et al., 2020). Other mAbs (SARS2-01, SARS2-02, SARS2-07, SARS2-16, SARS2-19,

576

SARS2-21, SARS2-22, SARS2-23, SARS2-31, SARS2-32, SARS2-34, SARS2-38, SARS2-55,

577

SARS2-58, SARS2-66 and SARS2-71) were generated as follows. BALB/c mice were immunized

578

and boosted twice (two and four weeks later) with 5-10 µg of RBD and S protein (twice)

26

579

sequentially, each adjuvanted with 50% AddaVax and given via an intramuscular route. Mice

580

received a final, non-adjuvanted boost of 25 µg of SARS-CoV-2 S or RBD (25 µg split via

581

intravenous and interperitoneal routes) 3 days prior to fusion of splenocytes with P3X63.Ag.6.5.3

582

myeloma cells. Hybridomas producing antibodies were screened by ELISA with S protein, flow

583

cytometry using SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, and single endpoint neutralization assays.

584

Human immune sera. The human sera samples 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, 23, 27, 28, 29,

585

30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39 used in this study were previously reported (Case et al., 2020),

586

Human donor samples were collected from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. Sera samples

587

were obtained by routine phlebotomy (Case et al., 2020). This study was approved by the Mayo

588

Clinic Institutional Review Board.

589

Neutralization assays using a recombinant VSV-SARS-CoV-2. Briefly, serial dilutions

590

of sera beginning with a 1:80 initial dilution were three-fold serially diluted in 96-well plate over

591

eight dilutions. Indicated dilutions of human serum were incubated with 102 PFU of VSV-SARS-

592

CoV-2 for 1 h at 37 °C. Human serum-virus complexes then were added to Vero E6 cells in 96-

593

well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 7.5 h. Cells were fixed at room temperature in 2%

594

formaldehyde containing 10 µg/mL of Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain for 45 min. Fixative was

595

replaced with PBS prior to imaging. Images were acquired using an In Cell 2000 Analyzer

596

automated microscope (GE Healthcare) in both the DAPI and FITC channels to visualize nuclei

597

and infected cells (×4 objective, 4 fields per well). Images were analyzed using the Multi Target

598

Analysis Module of the In Cell Analyzer 1000 Workstation Software (GE Healthcare). GFP-

599

positive cells were identified using the top hat segmentation method and counted within the InCell

600

Workstation software. ACE2 neutralization assays using VSV-SARS-CoV-2 were conducted

601

similarly. The initial dilution started at 20 g/mL and was three-fold serially diluted in 96-well plates

602

over eight dilutions. mAb neutralization assays using VSV-SARS-CoV-2were conducted similarly

603

but using an MOI of 100.

604

High-throughput assay using a recombinant VSV-SARS-CoV-2. Serial dilutions of

605

patient sera beginning with a 1:10 initial dilution were performed in 384-well plates and were

606

incubated with 104 PFU of VSV-SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h at 37°C. Vero E6 cells then were added to

607

the human serum-virus complexes in 384-well plates at 3 x 103 cells per well and incubated at

608

37°C for 16 h. Cells were fixed at room temperature in 4% formaldehyde and then rinsed with

609

PBS. Cells were stained at room temperature with NucRed Live 647 (Invitrogen) for 30 min.

610

Images were acquired using an InCell 6500 confocal imager (Cytiva) to visualize nuclei and

611

infected cells (4X objective, 1 field per well). Images were segmented using InCarta (Cytiva).

612

Virally-infected cells were identified by comparing to the uninfected threshold in Spotfire (Tibco).

613

Cells were also quality-controlled (gated) based on nuclear parameters.

616

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

617

All statistical tests were performed as described in the indicated figure legends. Non-linear

618

regression (curve fit) was performed to calculate IC50 values for Fig 3C, 4B, S4, and S5A using

619

Prism 8.0 (GraphPad). Non-linear regression (curve fit) was performed for Fig 1A, S1A, and S6A

620

using Prism 8.0. Non-linear regression (curve fit) was performed to calculate IC50 values for Fig

621

S5B using Spotfire (Tibco) after adding additional baseline and plateau points. Statistical

622

significance in data Fig 3B was calculated by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-test using

623

The order of immunogens used to immunize the mice, as described in the Methods.
Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by each mAb was assessed by focus-reduction

neutralization test. The half-maximal effective concentration (EC50 value) was determined
by nonlinear regression. Results are the geometric mean from three to four independent
experiments.
C

mAb was identified as mouse IgG1 and expressed as human IgG1.

Serum samples from 18 individuals were collected at different time points post-onset of
COVID-19 symptoms and screened using two ELISA assays (Euroimmun or Epitope). The
serum identifier numbers in the first column correspond to those of Fig 5 and S5. IgG
index values were calculated by dividing the optical density (O.D.) of the serum sample
by a reference O.D. control, and ratios were interpreted using the following criteria as
recommended by the manufacturer: Negative (-) < 0.8, Indeterminate (+/-) 0.8–1.1,
Positive (+) ³1.1
