Abstract
A critical event during the process of cell infection by a viral particle is attachment, which is driven by
adhesive interactions and resisted by bending and tension. The biophysics of this process has been
studied extensively but the additional role of externally applied force or displacement has generally
been neglected. In this work we study the adhesive force-displacement response of viral particles
against a cell membrane. We have built two models: one in which the viral particle is cylindrical (say,
representative of filamentous virus such as Ebola) and another in which it is spherical (such as SARSCoV-2 and Zika). Our interest is in initial adhesion, in which case deformations are small and the
mathematical model for the system can be simplified considerably. The parameters that characterize
the process combine into two dimensionless groups that represent normalized membrane bending
stiffness and tension. In the limit where bending dominates, for sufficiently large values of normalized
bending stiffness, there is no adhesion between viral particles and the cell membrane without applied
force. (The zero-external-force contact width and pull-off force are both zero.) For large values of
normalized membrane tension, the adhesion between virus and cell membrane is weak but stable. (The
contact width at zero external force has a small value.) Our results for pull-off force and zero force
contact width help to quantify conditions that could aid the development of therapies based on denying
the virus entry into the cell by blocking its initial adhesion.

1. Introduction
Virus infection is one of the major public health issues in the world. From one of the most lethal viruses,
Ebola virus, to Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing the present pandemic, countless people have
died from virus infection and complications.

Moreover, this is an ongoing concern because there will

always be new viruses or mutated ones. It is therefore important to develop an understanding of how
virus particles infect our body cells. One of the vital moments during infection is the internalization of
the virus particle often by hijacking the normal physiological adhesive function of the receptors on the
surface of the human body cell membrane.
Uptake of most virus particles into a host cell is mediated by the adhesive interaction between cell1-3
surface and virus-surface molecules.
Because blocking this adhesion is a prime therapeutic target, it is
important to understand the mechanics of initial virus adhesion to the cell.

In particular, we aim to

connect adhesion properties (measured, for example, by single-molecule force spectroscopy), and the
behavior of the whole virus-cell membrane interaction.
The mechanics and biophysics of this problem have been approached in a number of ways ranging from
all-atom molecular dynamics simulations that contain atomistic structural detail to continuum models
4,5
that contain only a few parameters that characterize virus, membrane, and adhesive properties.
The
former provides tremendous descriptive and predictive power but are, by construction, specific to a
particular system.

The latter allow investigation of more general principles at the cost of specificity.

There is a significant literature on continuum models of adhesion between particles (biological or
6
inorganic) and membranes. (See reference for a review.) Shanahan developed a model for compliant
7
particle adhesion onto a rigid surface.
Long et al. modeled aspects of the fusion of synaptic vesicles
with the plasma membrane, which is related to the problem of soft vesicles attaching onto a rigid
8
9
surface.
A similar model about kinetics of virus binding and fusion was developed by Chou.
Zhang
10
studied nanoparticle cellular endocytosis by considering parameters such as ligand density.
An important subclass of models, to which our work belongs, share the feature that the total
free energy is written as the sum of three contributions: from bending, tension, and adhesion. Several of
the models are based on the theory that the marginal reduction of the free energy during the adhesion
11-13
process balances the marginal cost of bending the membrane.
Several studies consider the process
14,15
of virus particle wrapping and engulfment by the cell membrane.

Other studies have considered the

combined effects of bending, tension, and adhesion, as the particle is wrapped partially to fully.
Although this problem of adhesion has been well-developed, much less attention has been paid
to the contact mechanics of viruses onto a flexible membrane. This is of interest because such analyses
can be used to interpret in detail atomic force microscopy (AFM) force-spectroscopy measurements of
17
force-deflection response used to characterize the adhesion process , particularly to interpret the
18-20
force-spectroscopy studies on virus host cell interactions.
It is also of interest because virus

−

attachment often occurs under external load, which is accounted for in a contact mechanics model but
not in most of the literature cited above.

In this work, we create a continuum model for the small-

deflection adhesive contact mechanics of virus particle attachment onto the host cell membrane in
terms of the principal biophysical properties of the virus, membrane, and their interaction.

We seek

equilibrium states by minimizing the total free energy of the virus-membrane system. In particular, we
seek to describe the force-deflection and contact area-deflection relationships. These results also help
to retrieve conditions for lack of adhesion, pull-off force, and contact area between the virus particle

and cell membrane. The common physical basis for the model is to assume that, for given applied
deflection, equilibrium states are achieved by a balance of adhesion energy of cell surface receptors,
which drives adhesion, against the cost of the associated deformation, represented by bending and
16,21
tension energies of the cell membrane.
We show that the solution is governed by two dimensionless
materials parameters that can be identified as a normalized bending stiffness and tension. (These
6,12
parameters have previously been identified.
) In particular, quantities of interest such as the
equilibrium contact size (if any) or force required to remove the virus from the membrane depend (in
dimensionless form) only on these two parameters. The analysis is carried out for 2D cylindrical and 3D
axisymmetric virus models representing, for example, a filamentous virus like Ebola virus or a nominally
spherical virus like SARS-CoV-2.
In the following sections we first outline how the problem is posed for both cylindrical and axisymmetric
models. In later sections we present the results of the model.

The Supporting Information contains

details of derivations.

2. Methodology
We now describe in outline the continuum models for adhesive contact between the virus and cellmembrane, driven by adhesion and external displacement or force, and resisted by tension and elastic
bending. Fig. 1 sketches the geometry of both cylindrical (i.e., 2D) and spherical (i.e., axisymmetric)
22
models. Aspects of the 2D model have been previously studied by Mkrtchyan et al.
, but without
external force or displacement.

For both the 2D and axisymmetric cases, we consider the case where

the viral particles are stiff compared to the cell membrane to which they attach. All the parameters and
non-dimensional parameters used for the models are summarized in Table 1.
The cell membrane, represented in Fig. 1 by the blue line, can be split into two parts, one that
contacts the virus particle and a second one that is out-of-contact. The virus particles in the 2D and
axisymmetric models are assumed to be cylindrical and spherical, respectively.

Because the virus is

represented by a rigid cylinder, the region of the membrane in contact has a circular cross-section in 2D,
23
ignoring end effects because the radius of the virus is quite small comparing to its length. For example,
the Ebola virus has diameter of about 80 nm, whereas its length can reach 1-2

μm. In the axisymmetric

model, the virus particle is assumed to be spherical and its region of contact with the membrane is a
spherical cap. For example, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is nominally spherical with a diameter
of around 120 nm. Since the diameters of both types of viruses are much smaller in size than the host
cell but large compared to the thickness of the membrane (~ 4 nm), we assume that the membrane of
the host cell is originally flat and deforms when in contact with the virus (blue line, Fig. 1). The width of
contact section in the 2D model is

2 and the host cell membrane is supported some distance     

away from the center of the virus attachment region. For nominally spherical viruses (such as HIV, Zika
virus and SARS-CoV-2) the contact region is circular with radius,
supported some radial distance

 away

.

The membrane of the host cell is

from axis of symmetry. As in the 2D model, the membrane is

assumed to be flat in its stress-free state; it deforms when in contact with the virus particle.

a. Free energy calculation
For both 2D and axisymmetric models, the interaction between the viral particle and the cell membrane
is driven by adhesive interactions and externally applied force or displacement. Attachment of the viral
particle to the cell membrane is resisted by energy required to bend the cell membrane and by the
tension it is under. We presume that the tension is set by some effect such as osmotic pressure and is
not constitutively linked to the deformation, i.e., it holds a constant isotropic value. In our models, the
parameters that govern the adhesive contact mechanics are (more in Table 1) bending rigid

However, since in this work we are

interested primarily in conditions close to the no-adhesion case, we can take advantage of a major
simplification in the shape equation for small deformations. We can additionally neglect the coefficient
of Gaussian curvature in the Helfrich Hamiltonian because the processes we study involve no change in
topology. With these two simplifications, the governing equation simplifies to a linear differential

Conversely, if the virus is small compared to this length, then bending does.

For the viral particles we wish to consider, using typical values given in Table.1, we estimate this ratio to
be about 50 nm, which means that both tension and bending energies can be important. A normalized

Again, we focus on the two limits in which either tension or bending dominate. Also, for the majority of
the discussion in the remainder of this manuscript when we refer, for example, to tension, we mean
normalized tension, since the discussion is almost exclusively of solutions to the normalized
dimensionless governing equations and parameters.

c. Solution Procedure
In normalized variables, the state of the system is described by five dimensionless variables (under
displacement control):

size of the membrane patch, normalized bending stiffness, and tension. We find that the effect of

In region II,

the deflection of the membrane is given by solving equation (4) or (6) subject to clamped boundary
conditions where the membrane is held fixed and continuity and smoothness of deflection at the
intersection between the two regions.

For example, in the axisymmetric spherical virus case where

bending dominates, the deflection in region II is given by the solution of equation (6) and is

where the first term represents adhesion energy (negative in value), the second term the bending
energy inside the contact region, and the third term the bending energy in region II. In general, the total
energy associated with a particular configuration of the system can be written as

U total = U total (δ , a , α , γ )

We now impose two equilibrium conditions. The first enforces the condition that for other fixed

For higher values of bending stiffness, the
contact reduces to zero while still under compressive load. Subsequently, the force-deflection behavior
follows that of a cylinder in line contact with the membrane.

Of course, in reality, true line contact is

not possible due to the finite thickness of the membrane.

cylindrical (filamentous) and spherical viruses, representative of two typical viral shapes such as Ebola
and SARS-CoV-2.

The principal result of the analyses is normalized force-deflection and contact

width/radius versus deflection as a function of two dimensionless materials parameters,
denoting normalized bending stiffness and tension, respectively.

and

,

We paid attention to limits in which

bending, or tension dominate the other.
In both the bending-dominated cases, a striking result is that for sufficiently stiff membranes
there is zero pull-off force and contact radius at zero force also vanishes.

For larger stiffness, contact

vanishes even under compressive indentation. The tension-dominated case is qualitatively different for
the 2D and axisymmetric shapes.
width

 decreases

In the tension-dominated limit of the cylindrical model, the contact

very slowly with increasing deflection.

In the axisymmetric geometry, in contrast,

there is a well-defined pull-off force that corresponds to contact shrinking to zero. We believe that the
force-displacement results can be related directly to the atomic force microscopy (AFM) force18 19,20
displacement measurements.
Our continuum model is a simple representation, attempting to capture many important details
in only a few physical parameters. In vivid biological context, things will be more complicated. However,
our model is suitable for application to interpretation of nanoindentation and force spectroscopy
experiments.

It also advances understanding of the biomechanics of filamentous and spherical virus

adhesive contact mechanics to cell membranes.
