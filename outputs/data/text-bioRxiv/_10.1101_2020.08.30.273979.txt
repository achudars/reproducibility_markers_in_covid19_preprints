Abstract
Proteases encoded by SARS-CoV-2 constitute a promising target for new therapies against
COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro, 3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro) are
responsible for viral polyprotein cleavage - a process crucial for viral survival and replication.
Recently it was shown that 2-phenylbenzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one (ebselen), an organoselenium
anti-inflammatory small-molecule drug, is a potent, covalent inhibitor of both the proteases and
its potency was evaluated in enzymatic and anti-viral assays. In this study, we screened a
collection of 23 ebselen derivatives for SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and Mpro inhibitors. Our studies
revealed that ebselen derivatives are potent inhibitors of both the proteases. We identified three
PLpro and four Mpro inhibitors superior to ebselen. Our work shows that ebselen constitutes a
promising platform for development of new antiviral agents targeting both SARS-CoV-2 PLpro
and Mpro.

1. Introduction
In the winter of 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia with flu-like symptoms emerged in Wuhan,
China.1,2 Shortly thereafter, the disease-causing pathogen was isolated and analyzed, leading to
identification of the novel, highly contagious human beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (formerly
known as 2019-nCoV).3 By the end of August 2020, with over 24.5 million people diagnosed
with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the death toll exceeded 830,000 patients
worldwide.4 With neither vaccines nor drugs targeting the virus available, various strategies
have been employed to accelerate finding an effective therapy to fight the pathogen.5 One of
these strategies is drug repurposing - establishing therapeutic properties for already approved
substances for new medical applications. This strategy can be supported by computational
analysis, which can lower the costs, speed up the process in comparison with de-novo
development of new therapeutics and serve as a first stage in screening vast libraries of active
compound.6–10 Drug repositioning has been already successfully used in fighting COVID-19.11
A bright example here is remdesivir, an antiviral agent targeting viral RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase (RdRp) that was designated to treat Ebola but has shown efficacy shortening
recovery time and reducing mortality as well as serious adverse effects in COVID-19 patients.12
Nonetheless, current treatment options are critically limited and finding new therapeutics for
COVID-19 patients constitutes a leading challenge for the scientific community.
To address the problem, medicinal chemists identified druggable targets among viral nonstructural proteins (nsps), two of them being proteases. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro,
3CLpro, nsp5) and the papain-like protease (PLpro, nsp3 papain-like protease domain) enable
viral replication in host cells by processing the viral polyprotein and generating 16 nsps, crucial
for virus replication. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro generates 13 viral nsps, making it a key player in the
process of virus replication and maturation.13–15 Mpro is a dimeric cysteine protease with a
structure highly conserved among human coronaviruses. Unusual preference for a glutamine
residue at the P1 position of the substrate cleavage site sets Mpro apart from known human
proteases. This feature can be beneficial for design and synthesis of effective, broad-spectrum
antiviral agents with minimum side effects.7,13,16–19 SARS-CoV-2 PLpro is a viral cysteine
protease proposed as an excellent target for COVID-19 treatment due to its pathophysiological
roles. PLpro processes viral polyprotein and generates proteins nsp1-3. Moreover, the protease
also alters the host immune response by deubiquitinating and deISGylating proteins within
infected cells.20–23 Thus, PLpro inhibition would not only block the replication of the virus, but
would also limit the dysregulation of cellular signaling mediated by ISG15 and ubiquitin.

2-phenylbenzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one (ebselen) is a small-molecule drug with a pleiotropic
mode of action in cells.24 Ebselen is an excellent scavenger of ROS that acts as a mimic of
glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and interacts with the thioredoxin (Trx) system by oxidation of
reduced TrxR.25–27 Recently it was shown that ebselen inhibits both the SARS-CoV-2 proteases.
Weglarz-Tomczyk et al. evaluated ebselen28 and a collection of its derivatives29 as inhibitors of
PLpro, leading to identification of inhibitors with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. In another
study, a library of approx. 10,000 drugs and drug candidates was screened for Mpro inhibitors.
As a result, ebselen displayed the lowest IC50 among the substances tested (0.67 µM),
furthermore it also displayed an antiviral effect in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells.7
In this work, we used ebselen and a collection of 23 of its derivatives to evaluate their properties
as SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and Mpro inhibitors. First, we screened the collection for inhibitors of
both proteases. Next, we determined the half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC50) values
for the most promising hits. We show that ebselen may constitute a potential lead compound
for development of novel antiviral agents. The results can be useful in the design of new active
compounds targeting the proteases encoded by SARS-CoV-2, to be applied in COVID-19
treatment.
2. Results & Discussion
The efficacy of ebselen and other organoselenium compounds has been previously evaluated
for HIV30,31, HSV232, HCV33, and Zika virus34 infections. Moreover, a recent report presents
ebselen and its derivatives as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro.29 In order to find new
inhibitors of proteases encoded by the new coronavirus, we screened a collection of ebselen
and its 23 derivatives with mono- or disubstitutions within the phenyl ring (Tab. 1).
2.1. Compound library screening for SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors
First, we evaluated the inhibitory properties for the compounds at 1 µM inhibitor concentration
and 100 nM SARS-CoV-2 PLpro. For the assay, we used the fluorogenic substrate Ac-LRGGACC with a structure based on the C-terminal epitope of Ub and ISG15 proteins as well as on
the nsp1/2, nsp2/3, and nsp3/4 cleavage sites in the coronaviral polyprotein. PLpro screening
resulted in identification of only one compound (7) with higher potency (84.4%) than ebselen
(65.4%). However, 7 differed from the other compounds in the collection as it was the only
investigated ebselen derivative with a 3-substituted pyridinyl moiety instead of a substituted
phenyl ring. The results also show that electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) at the ortho
position of the phenyl ring hamper inhibition of the PLpro by the compounds. Derivatives with

strong EWGs (trifluromethyl group for 5 and nitro group for 6) displayed the 2nd and 3rd lowest
potency, while the other compounds displayed approx. 50% of PLpro inhibition. We did not
observe any significant differences between inhibitory properties between mono- and
disubstituted ebselen derivatives.
2.2. Compound library screening for Mpro inhibitors
Next, we screened the library at 100 nM inhibitors and 100 nM Mpro concentrations. For the
assay, we used a novel tetrapeptide fluorogenic substrate for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, QS1 (Ac-AbuTle-Leu-Gln-ACC; KM=207.3±12 µM, kcat/KM=859±57 M-1s-1).17 As a result, ebselen displayed
57.6% Mpro inhibition. The best hits were compounds 10 and 17 with >80% of Mpro inhibition.
10 represents monosubstituted derivatives with a nitro group at the para position. Other
substitutions at the para position do not seem to have such a strong effect on inhibition of Mpro.
On the other hand, our second best hit, 17, has a 5-chloro-2-fluoro disubstituted phenyl ring and
represents a group of ebselen disubstituted derivatives. Analogically to 10, we did not identify
any other 2,5-disubstitutions providing a similar effect on Mpro inhibition. Interestingly, the
third best inhibitor (77.1%) has a 2,4-disubstituted phenyl ring. We also observed, that 2,4dimethoxy derivative (16) displays potency towards both of the proteases close to ebselen’s,
however, in comparison with ebselen, its toxicity evaluated in A549 human cell line was 10
times lower.35 In general, substitutions within the phenyl ring of ebselen boost inhibition of
Mpro as we identified only 3 compounds (6, 7, 12) with a potency lower than for ebselen.

2.3. IC50 determination
Based on the screening results, we selected ebselen and seven of its derivatives for further
inhibitory property evaluation. We chose compounds: a), exhibiting the highest potency
towards Mpro (10, 17) or PLpro (7) in the screening assay; or b), displaying relatively high
inhibition towards both the investigated proteases (3, 16, 20, 21) (Fig. 2). During the assays,
IC50 values for PLpro were in the micromolar range while for Mpro, they were in the low
nanomolar range. For the reference inhibitor, ebselen, IC50 values were respectively 1.12µM ±
0.06 and 30.91 ± 2.67 nM. Compound 7, which was the best hit in the PLpro inhibitor screening
assay, indeed had the lowest IC50 value (0.58 ± 0.04 µM) among the tested compounds. Despite
ebselen being the second best PLpro inhibitor in the screening assay, we found that two other
compounds (17, 21) displayed slightly lower IC50 values. As expected, 10 and 17, which were
selected for the analysis as the best Mpro inhibitors, displayed lower IC50 values than ebselen.
The most potent Mpro inhibitor with IC50=15.24 nM was compound 17, the second best hit from
the screening experiment. Interestingly, the best hit (11) displayed an IC50 value similar to
values determined for 3 and 21 (respectively 27.95, 25.69, and 27.37 nM). For 16 and 20, we
observed that despite a higher potency in the screening assay, the IC50 values determined for

with the determined IC50 values (Tab. 2).

3. Conclusions
With increasing concerns about upcoming waves of new SARS-CoV-2 infections, the need for
an effective and safe therapy against coronaviral diseases is growing. A promising strategy
involves Mpro inhibition and this approach can lead to novel, broad spectrum anticoronaviral
drugs.13 Recently, repurposing efforts enabled identification of ebselen as a potential drug
against COVID-19, due to its action as a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.7
Ebselen has a pleiotropic mode of action that is a result of its reactivity towards cysteine
residues affecting many biological pathways24,26 but on the other hand is a well-known
substance, the efficacy and safety in humans of which has been evaluated in various studies.36–
38

We utilized a collection of ebselen derivatives to find potent SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and Mpro

inhibitors. First, we screened a library of organoselenium compounds. Next, for selected
compounds, we determined IC50 values. The most potent PLpro inhibitor, 2-(3-hydroxypyridin7

2-yl)-1,2-benzoselenazol-3-one, displayed the highest potency in the screening assay and the
lowest IC50 value (0.578 µM). IC50 determination enabled identification of two more
compounds with inhibitory properties similar to ebselen. These compounds were 2,4- and 2,5disubstituted derivatives of ebselen that displayed lower potency during screening, but also
slightly lower IC50 parameters than for the reference inhibitor. A similar analysis for the Mpro
enabled identification of four compounds displaying higher potency during screening and a
lower IC50 parameter. Two of them had a monosubstituted phenyl ring at the para and ortho
positions, and two were disubstituted ebselen derivatives. The best inhibitor with an IC50 value
approx. 2 times lower than for ebselen was 2-(5-chloro-2-fluorophenyl)-1,2-benzoselenazol-3one. In this work, we showed that ebselen derivatives with substitutions and other modifications
within the phenyl ring generally possess good inhibitory properties against both the proteases
encoded by the novel coronavirus. These compounds constitute a promising platform for novel
therapeutics and we believe that the results obtained can be used to facilitate efforts towards
new anticoronaviral drugs to be used for the treatment of COVID-19.

4. Materials and methods
4.1. SARS-CoV-2 PLpro preparation
SARS-CoV-2 PLpro was prepared as described.22 In brief, pGEX6P-1-SARS-CoV-2PLpro was
transformed into BL21 (DE3) codon plus E. coli cells and induced with 0.1 mM IPTG and 0.1
mM ZnSO4 at 18°C overnight. GST-fusion SARS-CoV-2 PLpro was purified using standard
protocol. The fusion protein was cleaved using GST-PreScission protease at 4°C overnight
followed with desalting and passing through fresh glutathione beads to remove cleaved GST
and GST-PreScission protease. The sample was further purified using Superdex 200 pg sizeexclusion columns (GE) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 40 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT.
The peak fractions were pooled and concentrated to ~10 mg/ml and snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen for later use.
4.2. SARS-CoV-2 Mpro preparation
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was recombinantly produced as described.13 Briefly, the gene of the Mpro
was cloned into the PGEX-6p-1 vector, which has a Nsp4-Nsp5 and a PreScission cleavage site
at the N- and C-termini to generate the authentic target protein, respectively. The gene of the
target protein was expressed in the E. coli of the BL21-Gold (DE3) (Novagen) strain. The
recombinantly produced Mpro was purified by employing HisTrap FF (GE Healthcare) and ionexchange chromatography (Q FF, GE Healthcare), respectively. Finally, the target protein with
high purity was subjected to a buffer exchange (20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1
mM DTT, pH 7.8) for further experiments.
4.3. Synthesis of ebselen derivatives
The synthesis of biologically active organoselenium compounds is of current interest to many
research teams around the world.39–41 Ebselen and other benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-ones have
been previously prepared by several ways.42,43 In this work, we successfully synthesized ebselen
and benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-ones 1–23 functionalized at the N-2 position of the aryl ring, using
a four-step procedure previously described in literature, starting with anthranilic acid and
elemental selenium.35,44–46 The diazotation of previously protonated anthranilic acid,
selenentylation with freshly prepared disodium diselenide gave 2,2’-dicarboxydiphenyl
diselenide which was isolated before the reaction with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) to form 2(chloroseleno)benzoyl chloride, which is a key substrate in the synthesis of the
benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one unit. Tandem selenenylation/acylation reaction of appropriate

anilines used in excess or in stoichiometric amounts in the presence of anhydrous triethylamine
base in anhydrous MeCN or DCM provided ebselen and final products 1–23. As a key aniline
reagents we used 2-amino-3-hydroxy-pyridine, aniline and its mono- and disubstituted
derivatives. The aniline substituents used in different positions of the benzene ring were Me,
Ac, NHAc, NO2, CF3,OH, OMe and F, Cl, Br and I halides. Ebselen and compounds 1–23, of
which eight are new, were obtained. Purity of all new compounds was characterized.
4.4. Inhibitor screening
Evaluation of the compound library for inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
was carried out in Corning 96-wells plates. For PLpro, 1 µL of each compound in DMSO
solution was added to the wells. Next, 79 µL of enzyme preincubated for 10 min at 37°C in
assay buffer (50 mM Tris, 5 mM NaCl, 0.075% BSA, pH 7.5) was added to each well. The
enzyme was incubated with the compounds at 37°C for 30 min. Next, 20 µL Ac-LRGG-ACC
substrate in assay buffer was added to the wells. Final concentrations were: 100 nM enzyme,
10 µM substrate and 1 µM tested compounds. In the assay for Mpro, 1 µL of each compound in
DMSO solution was added to the wells. Next, 79 µL of enzyme in assay buffer (50 mM Tris, 1
mM EDTA, pH 7.3)47 was added to each well and the plate was incubated at room temperature
for 2 min. Next, 20 µL of QS1 substrate in assay buffer was added to the wells. Final
concentrations were: 100 nM enzyme, 50 µM substrate and 100 nM tested compounds.
Measurements were carried out at 37°C using a Molecular Devices Spectramax Gemini XPS
spectrofluorometer. ACC fluorophore release was monitored for 30 min (λex=355 nm, λem=460
nm). For the further analysis, the linear range of the progress curves was used. Measurements
were performed at least in duplicate. Results were presented as mean values of relative enzyme
inhibition (%, compared to the control measurement without inhibitor) with standard
deviations. During the assays, the DMSO concentration in the wells was <2%.
4.5. IC50 determination
To determine IC50, the relative activity of investigated proteases was assessed in at least 11
different concentrations of selected inhibitors. Initial compound concentrations were found
experimentally. Serial dilutions of inhibitors in assay buffers (described above) were prepared
on 96-well plates (20 µL of each dilution in wells). For SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, 60 µL enzyme
preincubated for 10 min at 37°C in assay buffer was added to the wells. The enzyme was
incubated with inhibitors for 30 min at 37°C. Next, 20 µL substrate (Ac-LRGG-ACC) in assay
buffer was added to the wells. Final concentrations were 100 nM enzyme and 10 µM substrate.

For SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, 60 µL enzyme was added with no preincubation. The enzyme was
incubated with inhibitor for 2 min at room temperature. Next, 20 µL of substrate (QS1) in the
assay buffer was added to the wells. Final concentrations were 100 nM for the enzyme and 50
µM for the substrate. Measurements were carried out at 37°C using a Molecular Devices
Spectramax Gemini XPS spectrofluorometer. ACC fluorophore release was monitored for 30
min (λex=355 nm, λem=460 nm). IC50 values were determined with GraphPad Prism software
using non-linear regression (dose-response – Inhibition equation) and presented as relative
enzyme activity vs. inhibitor concentration. Measurements were performed at least in triplicate.
Results are presented as mean values with standard deviations. During the assays, the DMSO
concentration in wells was <2%.
