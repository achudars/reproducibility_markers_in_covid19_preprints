Abstract

29

Background

30

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the development of new serological assays

31

that could aid in diagnosis and evaluation of seroprevalence to inform an

32

understanding of the burden of COVID-19 disease. Many available tests lack rigorous

33

evaluation and therefore results may be misleading.

34

Objectives

35

The aim of this study was to assess the performance of a novel multiplexed

36

immunoassay for the simultaneous detection of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2

37

trimeric spike (S), spike receptor binding domain (RBD), spike N terminal domain and

38

nucleocapsid antigen and a novel pseudo-neutralisation assay.

39

Methods

40

A multiplexed solid-phase chemiluminescence assay (Meso Scale Discovery) was

41

evaluated for the simultaneous detection of IgG binding to four SARS-CoV-2 antigens

42

and the quantification of antibody-induced ACE-2 binding inhibition (pseudo-

43

neutralisation assay). Sensitivity was evaluated with a total of 196 COVID-19 serum

44

samples (169 confirmed PCR positive and 27 anti-nucleocapsid IgG positive) from

45

individuals with mild symptomatic or asymptomatic disease. Specificity was evaluated

46

with 194 control serum samples collected from adults prior to December 2019.

47

Results

48

The specificity and sensitivity of the binding IgG assay was highest for S protein with

49

a specificity of 97.4% and sensitivity of 96.2% for samples taken 14 days and 97.9%

50

for samples taken 21 days following the onset of symptoms. IgG concentration to S

51

and RBD correlated strongly with percentage inhibition measured by the pseudo-

52

neutralisation assay.

53

Conclusion

54

Excellent sensitivity for IgG detection was obtained over 14 days since onset of

55

symptoms for three SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S, RBD and N) in this multiplexed assay

56

which can also measure antibody functionality.

Introduction

58

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first

59

recognised in January 2020 and rapidly spread world-wide with the WHO declaring a

60

COVID-19 pandemic on March 11th, 2020 (1). Soon after the identification and genetic

61

sequencing of the virus, diagnostic tests became available for the detection of live

62

virus in human secretions followed rapidly by tests designed to measure antibodies to

63

SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Antibody tests have a variety of uses including supporting

64

diagnosis and informing individual risk of future disease and thereby determining

65

correlates of and duration of protection. With further potential for understanding

66

exposure to virus which in turn could help inform disease burden estimates, studies of

67

transmission dynamics and modelling of the epidemic. Antibody tests are particularly

68

important in the context of mild or asymptomatic disease where a swab reverse

69

transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test may be negative. For this

70

reason, an understanding of the sensitivity and specificity of the tests being used is

71

critical.

72

The trimeric spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a large molecule that is critical to virus

73

dissemination and pathogenesis. It is densely glycosylated and present on the viral

74

surface and in most cases is cleaved by host proteases into the S1 and S2 subunits,

75

which are responsible for receptor recognition and membrane fusion respectively. S1

76

uses a region of the molecule, known as the receptor binding domain (RBD) to bind to

77

host ACE-2 receptor and thereby gain entry to the cell (2). Due to this critical function

78

in host-cell entry, the S protein is a major target for vaccine research. The N terminal

79

domain (NTD) of the spike protein does not interact with the receptor but contains the

80

functional elements required for membrane fusion of the virion. The nucleocapsid (N)

81

protein plays an important role in transcription enhancement and viral assembly (3).

82

Specific immunoglobulin-G (IgG) and IgM antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 S, N

83

and RBD of the spike protein develop between 6-15 days following disease-onset (4).

84

Despite a rapid increase in the number and availability of serologic assays that can

85

detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, most have undergone minimal external

86

evaluation and validation (5). The high sensitivity and specificity for commercially

87

obtainable kits are often not reproduced when appropriate samples are used for

88

evaluation. A recent large scale Spanish seroprevalence study used a point of care

89

IgG test with a stated sensitivity of 97.2% but on verification found it to have a

90

sensitivity of either 82.1%, 89.7%, 99.6% or 100% depending on the sample sets used

91

for evaluation (6). All assays currently suffer from the absence of a defined standard

92

serum so results are reported as positive or negative or as optical density readouts

93

complicating the comparison between assays and studies. Furthermore, most assays

94

measure responses to a single antigen, usually nucleocapsid or spike/spike derived

95

proteins, which may not capture the breadth of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.

96

Finally, for many binding assays, the relationship between the concentration of

97

antibody detected and their function is unclear and few available assays permit the

98

measurement of both binding and function on the same testing platform.

99

We have evaluated a novel assay designed to simultaneously measure IgG to four

100

SARS-CoV-2 antigens; full-length trimeric S, RBD and NTD of spike as well as N

101

protein. The assay, based on Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) technology, utilises a 96-

102

well based solid-phase antigen printed plate and an electrochemiluminescent

103

detection system. In addition, unlike most binding assays, this assay can be adapted

104

to measure the ability of serum to inhibit the interaction between spike protein

105

components and soluble ACE-2, also called a pseudo-neutralisation assay (7). To

106

evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the MSD assay, we were able to utilise a

Serum Samples

113

Serum samples for sensitivity analyses were obtained from Great Ormond Street

114

Children’s Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (GOSH) and came from three sources; (i)

115

healthcare workers who tested SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive following signs or

116

symptoms of COVID-19 and who gave written consent for participation in the service

117

evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 serological assays, (ii) staff enrolling in a prospective

118

longitudinal cohort study of SARS-CoV-Serology (COSTARS, IRAS 282713,

119

ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04380896) who tested positive in a commercial

120

screening assay for anti-Nucleocapsid IgG (Epitope Diagnostics Inc, San Diego, USA)

121

(iii) a small number of RT-PCR positive sera from hospitalised children (n=10).

122

Serum samples for the analysis of specificity were collected prior to December 2019

123

and derived from anonymised samples in assay development or quality control sera

124

developed for other assays or residual, anonymised samples from healthy adults

125

enrolled in previous studies.

126

Serum from two individuals with high convalescent antibody levels were pooled to

127

create an interim standard serum. This serum was calibrated against research

128

reagents NIBSC 20/130 and NIBSC 20/124 distributed by the National Institute for

129

Standards and Biological Control (NIBSC, Potters Bar, UK, https://www.nibsc.org/) for

antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. These two plasma samples were obtained from

132

COVID-19 recovered patients and were distributed with known end-point titres to

Serological assays

136

Samples were screened for IgG to SARS-CoV-2 N protein using a commercially

137

available kit (Epitope Diagnostics Inc, San Diego, USA) as previously described (8).

138

Meso Scale Discovery coronavirus panel for COVID-19 serology

139

A multiplexed MSD immunoassay (MSD, Rockville, MD) was used to measure the

140

antigen-specific response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and other respiratory pathogens.

141

A MULTI-SPOT® 96-well, 10 Spot Plate was coated with four SARS CoV-2 antigens

142

(S, RBD, NTD and N), SARS-CoV-1 and MERS spike trimers, spike proteins from

143

seasonal coronaviruses OCV43S and HKU1, influenza A antigen derived from

144

H3/HongKong and Bovine Serum Antigen. Antigens were spotted at 200-400 µg/mL

145

in a proprietary buffer, washed, dried and packaged for further use (MSD®

146

Coronavirus Plate 1). Proteins were expressed in a mammalian cell expression

147

system (Expi 293F), purified by ion exchange chromatography, affinity purification,

148

and size exclusion chromatography. They were characterized by reducing SDS Page

149

chromatography, mass spectrometry, size-exclusion chromatography and multi-angle

150

light scattering (SEC-MALS). All protein constructs were produced with His6 and/or

151

Strept-TAG affinity tags to support affinity purification; the spike proteins were

152

produced as trimers in the pre-fusion form. These assays were developed by MSD in

153

collaboration with the Vaccine Research Center at NIAID (A. McDermott).

154

Internal quality controls and reference standard reagents were developed from pooled

155

human serum. To measure IgG antibodies, plates were blocked with MSD Blocker A

156

for between 30 minutes and 2 hours then washed three times prior to the addition of

157

reference standard, controls and samples diluted 1:500 in diluent buffer.

158

incubation for 2 hours with shaking at 700rpm, the plates were washed three times

159

and detection antibody was added at 2 µg/mL (MSD SULFO-TAG™ Anti-Human IgG

160

Antibody). Plates were incubated for 1 hour with shaking and washed three times.

161

MSD GOLD™ Read Buffer B was added and the plates were read using a MESO®

162

SECTOR S 600 Reader.

antibody; monoclonal antibody against S protein; 200µg/ml), control sera and test sera

166

samples diluted 1 in 10 in assay diluent were added to the plates. Plates were

167

incubated for 1 hour with shaking at 700rpm. A 0.25µg/ml solution of MSD SULFO-

168

TAG™ conjugated ACE-2 was added to unwashed plates followed by incubation for 1

169

hour with shaking, plates were washed and read as above. Percentage inhibition was

170

calculated relative to the assay calibrator; the maximum inhibition reached with

171

calibrator was set as 100% inhibition, minimum at 0.01%.

(plotted as 100%-specificity %) calculated using each value in the data as a cut-off

179

were plotted for each antigen. A cut-off antibody concentration was chosen based on

180

the lowest value leading to a positive likelihood ratio (LR) of >10, in order to maximise

181

sensitivity while providing strong evidence to rule-in infection (9). For S antigen

182

binding, all LR’s were above 10, therefore the LLOD was used as the cut-off for this

183

antigen. Positive predictive value (PPV) was calculated as

184

𝑃𝑃𝑉 = !"#!$%$&$%' × *+"&,-"#." / (12!*".$3$.$%') × (12*+"&,-"#."),

185

negative predictive value (NPV) was calculated as

𝑁𝑃𝑉 = (12!"#!$%$&$%') × *+"&,-"#." / !*".$3$.$%' × (12*+"&,-"#.").

187

Comparisons between groups were performed by Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA

188

with Dunn’s correction for multiple comparisons. Correlation analysis was performed

189

using Spearman correlation. P values of <0.05 were considered as significant. Latent

190

class models with two classes were fitted with the binary antibody responses as

191

outcome variables, using the poLCA package in the R statistical environment. The

Results

194

Participants and samples

195

SARS-CoV-2 positive samples (COVID-19 cohort) comprised 169 PCR positive and

196

27 anti-N IgG positive serum samples from mild symptomatic or asymptomatic cases

197

(total n=196). The cohort comprised of 138 females, 56 males (2 not recorded) with a

198

median age of 37 years (range 1-66y). Recorded symptoms included abnormal taste

199

and smell, cough, fatigue and fever. The date of symptom onset was established and

200

verified for 168 subjects, time between symptom onset and sampling ranged from 4 to

201

63 days. Of the 169 individuals with documented RT-PCR testing, 37 samples were

202

negative for nucleocapsid IgG on the EDI screening ELISA and 11 were equivocal.

203

Serum samples were collected between 26th March and 18th May 2020 and analysed

204

between 1st June and 10th July 2020.

205

Control serum samples for the analysis of specificity comprised 194 anonymised

206

legacy samples obtained from healthy adults, aged predominantly over 50 years.

207
208

Standard serum assignment

209

An internal standard serum was assigned values for S, RBD and N by calibration

210

against the NIBSC control sera. The ECL signal obtained for NIBSC 20/130 was used

211

as a binding curve to assign arbitrary unit (AU) values for S and RBD while NIBSC

212

20/124 was used to assign a value for N (Supplementary Figure S1). Binding of pooled

213

standard serum to NTD produced low ECL signals and no endpoint titre corresponding

214

to NTD antigen was available for standard serum assignment. The interim values

215

assigned were S 2154 AU, RBD 1837 AU and N 3549 AU. NTD and the remaining

11

216

antigens were assigned a value of 1000 AU. The focus of this study was the evaluation

217

of the four SARS-CoV-2 antigens only.

218
219

Evaluation of the coronavirus panel for COVID-19 serology

220

The lower limit of detection (LLOD) was assigned as 1% of the standard value in AU,

221

for statistical purposes, values below LLOD were reported as half LLOD (Table 1).

222

The upper limit of detection (ULOD) was assigned for NTD and RBD only as the S and

223

N antigen did not reach an upper limit (Table 1). For statistical purposes, ULOD was

224

assigned the highest calculated concentration plus 20%.

225

The coefficient of variation (CV) between duplicates was assessed by analysing 390

226

samples run on 11 plates on 3 different days. All antigens produced a mean CV of

227

<15%, with only NTD falling above the accepted CV of 15% at 17.4% (data not shown).

228

Intra-assay (within plate) and inter-assay (between plate) variation of the assay was

229

assessed by running four samples of varying antibody levels in four replicates on the

230

same plate and across 4 different runs on different days (Supplementary Table 1). The

231

mean intra-assay CV was 6.2% and inter-assay variation <15% across all SARS-CoV-

232

2 antigens except NTD (19.0%) on one of four samples.

233

To control day to day performance of the assay, a QC sample was run on each plate

234

and an acceptable performance range was set as within 3 SD of the mean. This was

235

determined by running the sample on 8 different plates on 8 different days (average

236

CV 10.3%) (Table 1).

239

Figure 1A-D shows the concentration of IgG to each SARS-CoV-2 antigen in the

240

COVID-19 cohort and the controls. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves

241

were plotted to visualise the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for each

242

antigen (Figure 2A-D). The high area under the curve (AUC) values for S (0.95%;

243

95%CI 0.93 to 0.97), RBD (0.92%, 0.89-0.95) and N (0.90%, 0.87-0.94) indicates the

244

high accuracy of these tests. Table 1 shows the cut-off values selected using our rule

245

of choosing the lowest cut-off with LR>10. For S all LRs were above 10, therefore the

246

LLOD was used as the cut-off for this antigen. NTD data was less consistent than the

247

other SARS-CoV-2 antigens and demonstrated lower sensitivity and specificity (Figure

248

2D), so this antigen was not evaluated further.

249

The specificity for S, RBD and N assays calculated from the control sera were 97.4%

250

(95%CI 94.1 to 98.9), 92.3% (95%CI 87.6 to 95.3) and 92.8% (95%CI 88.2 to 95.7)

251

respectively (Table 2). Assay sensitivity was initially calculated on the entire COVID-

252

19 cohort; S antigen had the highest AUC and was the most sensitive and specific at

253

90.8% and 97.4% respectively.

254

Using the calculated specificity and sensitivity, the positive and negative predictive

255

values (PPV and NPV) for each antigen at a range of prevalence estimates between

256

0.01 and 0.5 were calculated (Supplementary Figure 3A-B). The PPV and NPV were

257

best for S antigen; for an overall prevalence of 10% the assay has a PPV of 80.4%

258

and NPV of 99.6% for samples taken over 14 days since onset of symptoms, this

259

increased to 92.5% and 98.7% for an overall prevalence of 25%.

262

Figure 3 shows the anti-S, RBD and N IgG concentration split into time since onset of

263

symptom intervals of 0-7 days, 8-14 days, 15-21 days and over 21 days. For all three

264

antigens, the median antibody concentration increased significantly between 8-14

265

days and over 21 days and all interval groups were significantly (p=<0.0001) higher

266

than the control cohort (Figure 3A-C). There was a significant association between

267

antibody concentration and time since onset of symptoms (SARS-CoV-2 S, Spearman

268

correlation (r)=0.453; SARS-CoV-2 RBD, r=0.478; SARS-CoV-2 N, r=0.392, all

269

p=<0.0001) (Supplementary Figure 2A-C).

270

The assay cut-off determined above was applied and sensitivity and specificity were

271

calculated for groups 0-7 days, over 7 days, over 14 days and over 21 since the onset

272

of symptom for (Table 2). The S antigen was the most sensitive of the three, with a

273

sensitivity of 96.2% and 97.9% >14 days and >21 days since onset of symptoms

274

respectively.

275
276

Antibody concentration relationship between antigens

277

The concentration of anti-S, RBD and N antibody all correlated significantly with each

278

other (p<0.0001; Figure 4A-C), the strongest association was between S and RBD

279

(r=0.882) (Figure 4A). Our two-class latent class model built using binary S, RBD and

280

N antigen results predicted known status with 81.1% (95%CI 74.8-86.2) sensitivity and

281

99.0% (95%CI 95.9-99.8) specificity. It therefore had lower sensitivity and no

282

meaningful improvement in specificity, compared to using the concentration of S

283

antibody alone, with the 21.54 AU cut-off.

2 receptor binding to the S and RBD antigens was calculated for the COVID-19 and

289

control group (Figure 5A-B). The percentage inhibition for the COVID-19 cohort was

290

significantly higher than the controls for both antigens (S, median 1.94% (95%CI 1.36-

291

2.25) vs 0.063% (95%CI 0.053-0.073), p=<0.0001 by Mann-Whitney U test; RBD,

292

1.50% (95%CI 1.064-2.11) vs 0.38% (95%CI 0.36-0.39); p=<0.0001). In the COVID-

293

19 cohort, there was a significant association between percentage inhibition and IgG

294

concentration for both S and RBD antigens (Spearman correlation (r)=0.805 and

295

r=0.834 respectively, p=<0.0001) (Figure 5C-D).

296

ROCs were plotted to visualise the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for S

297

and RBD neutralisation. Cut-offs (LR>10) were 0.162% for S and 0.524% for RBD

298

(shown by the dotted line on Figure 5A-B). Sensitivity and specificity for S were 97.8%

299

and 97.9% respectively but lower for RBD (77.2% and 92.8% respectively). In the

300

COVID-19 cohort there were some IgG positive sera that did not demonstrate

301

neutralisation (below cut-off, n= 4 for S and 36 for RBD). These sera were

302

predominantly those taken soon after the onset of symptoms; 22 between 0-7 days, 9

303

over 14 days and 5 over 21 days.

Discussion

305

Accurate tests of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are critical for reliably evaluating exposure

306

to the virus causing COVID-19. Despite a large number of assays rapidly becoming

307

available, many have not undergone rigorous evaluation. In this study we describe a

308

novel assay that can measure antibody to several SARS-CoV-2 antigens

309

simultaneously as well as evaluating the functional capacity of anti-Spike antibodies.

310

The assay we used is based on existing technology developed by Meso Scale

311

Discovery that uses high binding carbon electrodes in the bottom of 96-well

312

microplates. Each well contains up to 10 antigens bound in discrete spots and bound

313

serum-derived IgG is detected by electro-chemiluminescent labelled (SULFO-TAG)

314

anti-human IgG. Electricity is applied to the plate electrodes leading to light emission

315

by the SULFO-TAG labelled detection antibody and light intensity is measured to

316

quantify analytes in the sample. We decided to evaluate IgG only as the kinetics of

317

IgM responses appear to mimic those of IgG and thus add little value (4).

318

Unlike the majority of studies published to date, we were able to utilise a panel of

319

COVID-19 convalescent plasma recently distributed by WHO to calibrate an internal

320

standard made from pooled convalescent serum. This allowed us to express titres in

321

arbitrary units that can then be compared to other assays that report values calibrated

322

against the WHO panel. The assays performed reliably and consistently over the

323

period of study and passed all the performance criteria expected for a solid-phase

324

based assay with acceptably low inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation. A QC

325

range established for a medium titre serum gave consistent results throughout the

326

study indicating the stability and repeatability of the platform.

327

Using a carefully defined cohort of known SARS-CoV-2 exposed individuals and

328

relevant controls we were able to show the sensitivity and specificity of the assay for
16

329

the four antigens of interest. While all antigens had good specificity, the full-length

330

trimeric spike protein had the highest sensitivity, particularly for serum taken more than

331

14 days following the onset of symptoms. Comparing our data for the S and RBD

332

antigens to data in a recently published systematic review and metanalysis of the

333

diagnostic accuracy of serological tests for COVID-19 (10) the trimeric spike assay we

334

evaluated had superior sensitivity to all of the assays included in the review while the

335

RBD antigen performance was superior to most. The reason for this could be related

336

to the technical aspects of the assay itself including the integrity of the antigen used

337

and the sensitivity of the detection platform but also the use of a well-defined cohort

338

of individuals with known exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Only one of the four SARS-CoV-

339

2 antigens, the N terminal domain of the spike protein, did not perform well in this

340

assay with poor sensitivity due to the overlap in antibody titres between the COVID-

341

19 cohort and controls.

342

The ability to simultaneously measure responses to various SARS-CoV-2 antigens

343

could be seen as an advantage in this type of assay although we did not show an

344

advantage of combined analysis of responses to three antigens compared to using S

345

antigen results alone to predict exposure correctly to the virus. The assay format also

346

permitted the measurement of antibody against spike protein derived from SARS-1,

347

MERS and two seasonal coronaviruses, but the results of antibody binding to these

348

antigens could not be assessed in the same way as for the SARS-CoV-2 antigens due

349

to the absence of defined negative and positive serum sets.

350

A further advantage of this assay is the ability to adapt it for measuring antibody

351

induced inhibition of the interaction between the spike antigen and soluble ACE-2

352

receptor, without the use of live virus and category 3 facilities. This is important as it

353

is thought to be the major mechanism by which SARS viruses, including SARS-CoV-

17

354

2 attach to host cell surfaces (11, 12). In the COVID-19 group, there was a good

355

correlation between the concentration of anti-S and anti-RBD IgG and the inhibitory

356

capacity of serum measured in the pseudo-neutralisaton assay, although a few sera

357

bound antigen but did not neutralize ACE-2 binding. Recently, a study of convalescent

358

serum by Sedoux et al. identified that the majority of antibodies against spike that were

359

generated during the first weeks of COVID-19 infection were non-neutralising and

360

target epitopes outside the RBD (13) which may account for our results. Few of the

361

control cohort sera had any pseudo-neutralisation activity suggesting that pre-existing

362

IgG directed against seasonal Coronavirus spike proteins are unlikely to modify

363

interaction with SARS-CoV-2 although other cross reactive immunological

364

mechanisms (eg T cells) cannot be ruled out and may explain the varied clinical

365

response following exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (14). This pseudo-neutralisation assay

366

has been shown to correlate well with neutralisation assays using live SARS-CoV-2

367

(MSD, personal communication). While plaque reduction neutralisation assays are

368

currently standard for determining host antibody induced viral inhibition, they must be

369

performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory which limits their widespread use.

370

In summary, the MSD multiplexed coronavirus panel assay evaluated in this study is

371

highly reproducible, specific and sensitive for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2

372

antibody over 14 days since the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. The assay can be

373

adapted to measure antibody function which corelated well with spike protein antibody

374

concentration.

Graphs show the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 antibody against (a) spike (S), (b)
receptor binding domain (RBD) and (c) nucleocapsid (N) in arbitrary units (AU)
(based on the calibrated internal standard serum) of the COVID-19 cohort split
in to intervals of 0-7 days, 8-14 days, 15-21 days and over 21 (>21) days since
symptom onset (to sample collection). Error bars show geometric mean with
95% CI, line shows positive/negative discrimination cut-off, *p<0.05, ** p<0.01
determined by Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. Comparisons across interval
groups had p<0.0001 by one-way ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis test. The assay
sensitivity at each time point is shown in Table 3.

Graph shows ECL signal obtained from a serial dilution series (1 in 100, then 1
in 4 serial dilution) of standard serum and NIBSC control sera 20/130 and
10/124. NIBSC control serum 20/130 was used to assign values to standard
serum for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and receptor binding domain (RBD) and NIBSC
control serum 20/124 was used to assign a value to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid
(N). No endpoint titre corresponding to NTD antigen was available for
standard serum assignment.
