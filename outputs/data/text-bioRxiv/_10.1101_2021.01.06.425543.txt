Abstract

21

In this paper, heterogeneity is formally defined, and its properties are explored. We define and

22

distinguish observable versus non-observable heterogeneity. It is proposed that heterogeneity among the

23

vulnerable is a significant factor in the contagion impact of COVID-19, as demonstrated with incidence

24

rates on a Diamond Princess Cruise ship in February 2020. Given the nature of the disease, its

25

heterogeneity and human social norms, pre-voyage and post-voyage quick testing procedures may

26

become the new standard for cruise ship passengers and crew. The technological advances in testing

27

available today would facilitate more humanistic treatment as compared to more archaic quarantine and

28

isolation practices for all onboard ship. With quick testing, identification of those infected and thus not

29

allowed to embark on a cruise or quarantining those disembarking and other mitigation strategies, the

30

popular cruise adventure could be available safely again. Whatever the procedures implemented, the

31

methodological purpose of this study should add valuable insight in the modeling of disease and

32

specifically, the COVID-19 virus.

1. INTRODUCTION
In the literature, the term heterogeneity echoes differently in various contexts. What is heterogeneity

39

or its antonym, homogeneity? Its root word lies in Greek “heterogenes” meaning different. In

40

epidemiology or statistics disciplines, the word heterogeneity is popularly commented to exist when the

41

variance is large. In insurance applications, for an example, the premium is assessed more if the insurer

42

is in a heterogeneous group with high hazard proneness (Spreeuw, 1999). Should a large (small)

43

variance be indicative of heterogeneity (homogeneity)? Interesting discussions are given for

44

heterogeneity in Ecochard (2006); in healthcare disciplines, heterogeneity is referred to as different

45

outcomes among patients. Should the heterogeneity be connected to only a non-observable hidden trait

46

as done in genetics? Does heterogeneity refer dissimilar attributes across the subgroups of the population

47

itself even before sampling? Is heterogeneity really pointing to the non-identical nature in a random

48

sample or population? Should heterogeneity imply a shifting entity? In genetic studies, several authors

49

refer to genetic heterogeneity as rather too difficult to ascertain. What do they really mean? If alleles in

50

more than one locus exhibit susceptibility to a disease, there is a need to track the loci to infer their

51

heterogeneity. So, in a sense, the application of heterogeneity is really a discussion of an opposite of

52

similarity across loci. The reader is referred to Elston et al. (2003, pages 3404-344) for details. Hope and

53

Norris (2013) attempted to determine how heterogeneity played a role in judgements in the context of

54

crime victimization. Hence, what really is heterogeneity? A formal definition of heterogeneity is

55

constructed later in the article, then, its properties are explored and itemized.

56

However, in the epidemiology literature, using a random sample y1 , y 2 ,..., y n from a population

57

whose main parameter is  , when the null hypothesis H o : 1   2  ....   n is tested, it is named the

58

homogeneity test. This suggests that heterogeneity is really all about a shifting population. This creates

59

more confusion. Is the source of such confusion with respect to heterogeneity its ill communication? It is

60

evident that there is a lack of a clear definition of heterogeneity given by Hunink et al. (2018, Chapter

61

12) for details. Neither the Encyclopedia of Statistical Sciences nor the Encyclopedia of Biostatistics has

62

even an entry, as if it is not pertinent in statistical disciplines.

63

One comes across different types of data in epidemiologic studies. Drawing data from a binomial

64

population is one of them, and the data should possess an under dispersion (i.e., variance of the binomial

65

distribution is smaller than its mean). From a Poisson population, the drawn random sample ought to

Page 3 of 36

66

reflect equality between the mean and variance. When the main (incidence rate) parameter of a Poisson

67

chance mechanism is stochastically transient, the unconditional observation of the random variable

68

convolutes to an inverse binomial model (Ross, 2002). The inverse binomial distribution is known to

69

attest that the variance is larger than its mean (Stuart and Ord, 2015, for details). Consequently, a

70

comparison between the mean and variance characterizes only which type binomial, Poisson, or inverse

71

binomial possesses the underlying chance mechanism we are sampling from but does not inform

72

anything about heterogeneity.

73

With details about the probabilistic patterns among coronavirus confirmed, recovered, or cured

74

individuals and those that succumb as fatalities/deaths in the thirty-two states/territories of India are

75

given by Shanmugam (2020). To track the confusion with respect to heterogeneity, let us consider the

76

data given in Table 1 (Mizumoto and Chowell, 2020), describing the spread of COVID-19 among the

77

voyagers in a Diamond Princess Cruise ship, during the month of February 2020. The random variables

78

Y1 , Y2 , and Y3 denote, respectively, the number of COVID-19 cases, the number of asymptomatic cases

79

and the number of symptomatic cases among them in time (date). Under a given COVID-19’s

80

prevalence rate,   0 , the number Y1 perhaps follows a Poisson probability pattern. For a given number

81

of COVID-19 cases in a date, the number Y2 perhaps follows a binomial probability pattern with

82

parameters ( y1 , p ) , where 0  p 1 denotes the chance for a COVID-19 case to exhibit no symptoms.

83

Naturally, the number Y3 should follow a binomial probability pattern with parameters ( y1 ,1  p ) . There is

84

an implicitness between Y2 and Y3 , in the sense that Y2  Y3  Y1 . There are three-time oriented groups of

85

COVID-19 incidences in Table 1. Is there an observable heterogeneity among the three groups? If so, is

86

it due to a non-observable (parametric) heterogeneity? How do we define and distinguish observable

87

versus non-observable heterogeneity? A literature search in epidemiology and/or biostatistics does not

88

provide an answer to this question.

89

It is evident that the average of COVID-19 cases is an estimate of COVID-19’s prevalence rate (i.e.,

90

̂ in Table 1). Their estimates impress that the prevalence rate is transient, not constant across every pair

91

of two-day duration dyads. The Poisson population from which the COVID-19 cases are drawn ought to

92

have been dynamic, implying the existence of a Poisson heterogeneity. How do we define and/or capture

93

the heterogeneity level? This is the theme and purpose in this research article.

94

Likewise, given that a fixed number, y1 of COVID-19 cases has occurred, a part of them might be

95

asymptomatic cases, y2 and the remaining are symptomatic cases, y3 . That is, y2 and y3 are

96

complementary but y2  y3  y1 . Is there heterogeneity in each of the two sub-binomial populations,

97

whether there is a heterogeneity in y1 ? How should each binomial heterogeneity be defined and

98

computed? In other words, is binomial heterogeneity different from that of Poisson heterogeneity? If so,

99

what are the differences? A literature search in epidemiology and/or biostatistics offers no help to prove

100

either the existence or absence of binomial heterogeneity in the data for y2 or y3 in Table 1. Hence, we

101

continue probing matters with respect to heterogeneity.

102

The concept of heterogeneity seems to have escaped the researchers and epidemiologists’ scrutiny

103

for a long time. It is time well spent and worthwhile to revive an interest in the construct of

104

heterogeneity, and that is exactly what this article is trying to accomplish. Hence, we first define and

105

construct an approach for the idea of heterogeneity. To be specific, we first discuss Poisson

106

heterogeneity and then take up binomial heterogeneity. Maybe our research direction about

107

heterogeneity is, perhaps, pioneering. However, we believe that our approach is easily extendable for

108

many other similar methodological setups. We illustrate our definition and all derived expressions for

109

heterogeneity using COVID-19’s data pertaining to the Diamond Princess Cruise ship, Yokohama, 2020

110

as displayed in Table 1.

2. POISSON AND BIONOMIAL HETEROGENEITIES

113

Applied epidemiologists emphasize that heterogeneity is of paramount importance in extracting and

114

interpreting data evidence. Many data analysts are convinced that an unrecognized heterogeneity leads

115

to a biased inference. To begin with, what is heterogeneity? It is a factor causing non-similarities. If so,

116

how many sources are there? We contemplate that there are two sources for heterogeneity to exist. One

117

source ought to be from the drawn random sample of observations: y1 , y2 ,....., yn , which we recognize as

118

observable heterogeneity. Would the sampling variability, Var [ f ( y1 , y 2 ,....., y n  )] for a selected statistic

119

f ( y1 , y 2 ,....., y n  ) express the observable heterogeneity? Another source is manifested in non-

120

observable parameter,  of the chance mechanism, which we recognize as non-observable

121

heterogeneity. Would a non-uniform stochastic pattern of  be indicative of the non-observable

122

homogeneity? If the chance mechanism perversely selects a probability density function (pdf) for  ,

123

how would it manifest itself to portray the non-observable heterogeneity? Both observable and non-

124

observable heterogeneity together ought to be involved to make any definition of heterogeneity

125

complete. If so, how do we integrate them? Often, under/over-dispersion is confused with heterogeneity.

126

It seems that the over/under dispersion is precipitated by heterogeneity but not the other way. It is not

127

obvious or proven so far in the epidemiology literature on whether the converse is true. We focus only

128

on Poisson and binomial populations to address heterogeneity, and these arguments can be repeated for

129

other populations considering similar methods.

POISSON HETEROGENEITY

132

Recall that the random integer, Y1 denoting the number of COVID-19 cases in a place (like the

133

Diamond Princess cruise ship) at a time (like February, 2020) is a Poisson random variable with a

134

specified prevalence rate,   0 . That is, the conditional probability of observing y1 number of COVIDPage 6 of 36

135

19 cases under a prevalence rate   0 is Pr[Y1  y1  ]  e    y / y1 !; y1  0,1, 2,...;   0 with its

136

expected number E [Y1  ]   and variability Var [Y1  ]  E [Y1  ] . The reader is referred to Rajan and

137

Shanmugam (2020) for detailed derivations of the Poisson mean and variance. The prevalence parameter

138

 itself is crucial in our discussions. The Poisson variability cannot be heterogeneity, because the

139

expected value also changes when the variability changes due to their inter-relatedness. Realize that no

140

two individuals on the ship are assumed to have the same level of susceptibility to the COVID-19 virus.

141

It is reasonable to imagine that the prevalence levels follow a conjugate, stochastic gamma distribution.

142

The so-called conjugate prior knowledge in the Bayesian framework smooths the statistical analytic

143

process. It is known that the conjugate prior for the Poisson distribution is gamma, whose pdf is

146

and variability Var (   ,  )  E (   ,  ) /  , where the parameters  and


147

with an average. E (  ,  ) 

148

 are recognized as hyper-parameters (Rajan and Shanmugam, 2020). Notice that the hyper parameter

149

  0 causes the variability in the COVID-19’s prevalence rate to fluctuate up or down, and, hence, you

150

would anticipate the heterogeneity to involve the hyperparameter  . But the question is how?

151

We assume that the probability of observing a non-negative COVID-19 case, y1 is a Poisson under a

152

stable sampling population Pr(Y1  ) with an expected number E (Y1  )   and a variability

153

Var (Y1  )  E (Y1  ) . With replications, the observable heterogeneity should become estimable. That is

154

to mention, the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the COVID-19 prevalence rate is the average

155

number, y1 , of the observations. To discuss the non-observable heterogeneity, we need to integrate its

conjugate prior c (   ,  ) for the non-observable  with the likelihood Pr(Y1  ) and it results in an update

157

and it is called posterior pdf for  . The expressions for non-observable heterogeneity, observable

heterogeneity and other expressions are given in Appendix I.

160

BINOMIAL HETEROGENEITY
In this section, we explore heterogeneity for two sub-binomial processes emanating from a Poisson

161

process. The asymptomatic number, Y2 and symptomatic number, Y3 of COVID-19 cases are two

162

branching binomial random numbers out of the Poisson random number, Y1  0,1, 2,...; of COVID-19

163

cases. These two split random variables are complementary of each other in the sense that Y2  Y3  Y1 .

164

Then, what are the underlying model for Y2 and for Y3 ? Are they correlated random variables? If so, what

165

is their correlation? These are pursued in this section.
Let I be an indicator random variable defined as: I i  1 for a COVID-19 case to be asymptomatic

166
167

with a probability, 0  p 1 and I i  0 for the case to be symptomatic with a probability, 0  1 p  1.

168

Then, for a fixed y1 , the random variable, Y2   I i follows a binomial probability distribution with

Y1

i 1

169

parameters ( y1 , p ) . Likewise, for a fixed y1 , the random variable, Y3  y1  Y2 follows a complementary

170

binomial distribution with parameters ( y1 ,1  p ) .That is,

3. TANGO INDEX

178

Lastly, we develop the Tango index and its significance level over the time period. Tango (1984)

179

proposed an index to detect disease clusters in grouped data. This index received considerable attention

180

in the literature. Following the line of thinking in Tango (1984), we could next assess the MLEs of

181

several entities we estimated and displayed in Tables 1, 2, and 3. There are three groups of duration.

182

Group 1 consists of the 15th and 16th of February 2020. Group 2 includes data for 17th and 18th of

183

February 2020. Group 3 contains data of 19th and 20th of February 2020. Two independent contrasts

184

among the three groups are feasible. In an arbitrary style, we select to compare Group 1 with Group 2

185

and then Group 2 with Group 3. For this purpose, we formulate a contrast matrix

186

where the third column of the matrix needs no explanation. The Tango’s statistic T  r ' Ar follows a chi-

190

square distribution with v  2 degrees of freedom (df), where r1 x' 3 is a row vector of the MLE of a chosen

191

entity in our analytic results in Table 1 or Table 2 or Table 3. For an example, let r '  (68.5,93.5,46)

192

for the MLE of the COVID-19 prevalence rate,  in the groups. Then, the Tango’s test statistic is

193

T  422.25 with v  2 df and

194

its p-value are calculated and displayed in Table 4 for other entities.

197

In this section we illustrate all the concepts and expressions of Section 2. Let us consider the

198

COVID-19 data in Table 1 for the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship, 2020. The Diamond Princess is

199

a cruise ship registered in Britain and operated across the globe. During a cruise that began on 20

200

January 2020, positive cases of COVID-19 linked to the pandemic were confirmed on the ship in

201

February 2020. Over 700 people out of 3,711 became infected (567 out of 2,666 passengers and 145 out

202

of 1,045 crew), and 14 passengers died. To be specific, on the 15th of February 2020, 67 people were

203

infected, on the 16th of February 2020, 70 people were infected, on the 17th of February 2020, there were

204

99 COVID-19 cases, on the 18th of February, another 88 cases were confirmed. The U.S. government

205

initially asked Japan to keep the passengers and crew members on board the ship for 14 days. The U.S.

206

government, however, later decided to bring them to an Air Force base in California and a base in San

207

Antonio, Texas.

208

For each specified day in the first column in Table 1, the estimate of COVID-19’s prevalence rate

209

and its variance are calculated using expressions ˆ  y1 and Var
ˆ (Y1  )  s y2 . Both the prevalence and its

210

variability increased and then decreased over the days. However, their correlation, ˆY ,Y is calculated

211

using the observed numbers on y2 and y3 for each day (see in Table 2) and the estimated correlations had

212

been stable over the days. Substituting ˆ  y1 and Var

we obtained the observable heterogeneity and displayed in Table 2. The observable Poisson

heterogeneity was low on the first day, increased and then decreased. Note in Table 2 that the observable

220

and non-observable Poisson heterogeneities are inversely proportional. In other words, the estimate of

221

the shape and scale parameter in the Bayesian approach are respectively ˆ 

222

values in Table 2). The shape parameter value decreased consistently over the days. The scale parameter

223

was high to begin with, then increased later. The distance, d ( y1 ,  ) between the observable and non-

224

observable Poisson mechanism for y1 is calculated using the expression

in Section 2.2, we calculated the odds for a COVID-19 case to become an asymptomatic type and

(9),

238

we estimated the odds for a COVID-19 case to become a symptomatic case as shown in Table 2. Notice

239

that both odds ( OddsY and OddsY ) are low but their odds ratio,

is not negligible but reveals that the situation is favorable to symptomatic rather than asymptomatic.

242

This discovery is feasible because of the approach, and it is an eye-opening reality for the medical

243

professionals in their desire to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Both the observable, Hˆ y2 y1 and

244

non-observable, Hˆ y , , binomial heterogeneity (see their values in Table 3) were decreasing for the

245

number, y2 of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. The distance, d ( y2 , p ) between the observable and non-

246

observable for asymptomatic cases was moderate in the beginning, then increased, and then decreased

247

over the next days (see their values in Table 3). However, the distance, d (Y2 , Y3 ) between the observable,

248

y2 of the asymptomatic cases and the observable, y3 of the symptomatic cases was narrow, then wider,

249

and then moderate over the days (their values in Table 3).

For a COVID-19 case to become a symptomatic type, the chance is moderate to less and then more

251

over the days ( 1 p in Table 3). The estimate of the shape and scale parameter happened to be ˆ and ˆ

252

respectively (see their values in Table 3). Both the shape parameter and the scale parameter values

253

decreased drastically over the days. From the p-values in Table 4, we infer that the prevalence rate, ̂ ,

254

the distances, d ( y1 ,  ) , d ( y2 , p ) and d (Y2 , Y3 ) do differ significantly over the three groups of dyad days.

The chance for COVID-19 to become an asymptomatic type does not differ significantly across the three

256

groups. On the contrary, the non-observable heterogeneities H ˆ of the Poisson random number, y1 and

5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The risk of contracting the COVID-19 virus during a cruise is more than in a community setting, as

270

confined spaces discourage non-pharmaceutical mitigation strategies such as social distancing to be

271

weakly implemented and breathing air is tightly internalized. More nations are afraid to let the voyagers

272

come ashore at the seaports. Ships are not even permitted to dock at the port, as to not complicate virus

273

mitigation efforts by the local surrounding communities. The scenario seems to be anti-humanistic. The

274

medical doctors and/or pharmaceutical service were strained due to the infected and COVID-19-free

275

voyagers. Lack of clear symptoms among those that were infected added to difficulties in managing the

276

COVID-19 crisis onboard the ship, and for any ship for that matter. Most importantly, how do we

277

dispose of the COVID-19 fatalities (bodies), in a safe manner?

278

In the midst of uncertainties about the root cause and/or the appearance of any symptoms, the best

279

modelers can do (as it is done in this article) is to devise a methodology to address the observable as

280

well as non-observable heterogeneity, estimate the proportion of COVID-19 cases to be asymptomatic,

281

estimate the odds of becoming symptomatic, and also the odds ratio for asymptomatic in comparison to

282

those symptomatic among COVID-19 cases. Some of these are non-trivial to the professional experts

283

dealing with the intention of reducing the spread of COVID-19 if not its total control. Still much of

284

COVID-19 is a mysterious pandemic. It is clear that non-pharmaceutical mitigation strategies such as

285

social distancing, utilization of face coverings, frequent hand sanitization, infected people quarantining

286

on board, and severely controlled ship cleanliness and sanitation standards are required; this may only be

287

successful with limited numbers of passenger and crew members. Given the nature of the disease, its

288

heterogeneity and human social norms, pre-voyage and post-voyage quick testing procedures may

289

become the new standard for cruise ship passengers and crew. The technological advances in testing

290

provided today would facilitate more humanistic treatment as compared to more archaic quarantine and

291

isolation practices for all onboard ship. With quick testing, identification of those infected and thus not

292

allowed to embark on a cruise or quarantine those disembarking, and other mitigation strategies, the

293

popular cruise adventure could be available safely again. Whatever the procedures implemented, the

294

methodological purpose of this study should add valuable insight in the modeling of disease and

295

specifically, the COVID-19 virus.

Poisson Heterogeneity: Derivations

It is known that the conjugate prior for the Poisson distribution is gamma, whose pdf is

with an average. E (  ,  ) 


and variability Var (   ,  )  E (   ,  ) /  , where the parameters 


358

and  are recognized as hyper-parameters (Rajan and Shanmugam, 2020). Notice that the hyper

359

parameter   0 causes the variability in the COVID-19’s prevalence rate to fluctuate up or down and

360

hence, you would anticipate the heterogeneity to involve the hyperparameter  .

with respect to the non-observable parameter,  , setting it equal to zero and solving it, we obtain the

375

MLE and it is ˆmle  y1 . Because of the invariance property of the MLE, it is involved. The invariance

376

property refers to that the MLE of a function of the parameter is the function of the MLE of the

377

parameter. Also, it is known (Blumenfeld, 2010) that

and

Var ( y1 )  E priorVarlikelihood ( y1  )  Varprior E likelihood ( y1  ) .

Hence, we are ready now to define the non-observable heterogeneity below in the Definition 1.

Before we apply the Definition 2, let us recollect that the marginal pdf of the complete sufficient

406

statistic, y1 is uniform distribution and the posterior distribution is

Furthermore, the distance, d ( y1 ,  ) between the observable y1 of the number of COVID-19 cases and the

Binomial Heterogeneity: Derivations

Furthermore, we wonder whether the random variables Y2 and Y3 are correlated? The answer is

Their expected distance, d (Y2 , Y3 )  EY E ( Y2  Y3 Y1 ) portrays the drift between the symptomatic

observable, Y2 and the asymptomatic observable, Y3 and it is simplified to this function

Let us assume that every COVID-19 case has the same chance of being asymptomatic in a time

504

period. Then, the random number, y2 for a specified number, y1 of COVID-19 cases follows a binomial

distribution with parameters ( y1 , p ) . We select a conjugate beta prior distribution

where the parameters  and  are hyper-parameters (Rajan and Shanmugam, 2020, for details). We
