Abstract

35

As the highly risk and infectious diseases, the outbreak of coronavirus disease

36

2019 (COVID-19) poses unprecedent challenges to global health. Up to March 3,

37

2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 89,000 people in China and other 66

38

countries across six continents. In this study, we used 10 new sequenced genomes of

39

SARS-CoV-2 and combined 136 genomes from GISAID database to investigate the

40

genetic variation and population demography through different analysis approaches

41

(e.g. Network, EBSP, Mismatch, and neutrality tests). The results showed that 80

42

haplotypes had 183 substitution sites, including 27 parsimony-informative and 156

43

singletons. Sliding window analyses of genetic diversity suggested a certain mutations

44

abundance in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2, which may be explaining the existing

widespread. Phylogenetic analysis showed that, compared with the coronavirus

46

carried by pangolins (Pangolin-CoV), the virus carried by bats (bat-RaTG13-CoV)

47

has a closer relationship with SARS-CoV-2. The network results showed that

48

SARS-CoV-2 had diverse haplotypes around the world by February 11. Additionally,

49

16 genomes, collected from Huanan seafood market assigned to 10 haplotypes,

50

indicated a circulating infection within the market in a short term .The EBSP results

51

showed that the first estimated expansion date of SARS-CoV-2 began from 7

52

December 2019.

Introduction

57

As the largest non-segmented genomes among all the RNA viruses (about 30 kb

58

in length), Coronaviruses (CoVs) own the plasticity due to the mutation and

59

recombination, which increased the potential risks of spread across species (Cui and

60

Shi, 2019; Gorbalenya et al., 2020). The COVID-19 (original named 2019-nCOV) is

61

the seventh member of enveloped RNA coronavirus (subgenus, Sarbecovirus;

62

subfamily, Orthocoronavirinae) (Zhu et al., 2020). In early December, 2019, an

63

unexplained pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome

64

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China (Huang et al., 2020; Lu et al.,

65

2020). The rapid emergence and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 between infected and

66

healthy people became so devastating as a large population within Wuhan was getting

67

infected (Guan et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020). There's evidence that SARS-CoV-2

68

may have originated from bats, but there is no clear information about the

69

intermediate host that transferred it to humans (Wassenaar et al., 2020; Zhou et al.,

70

2020; Wu et al., 2020). On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO)

71

declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a Public Health Emergency of International

72

Concern. Up to March 3, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 89,000 people in

73

China and other 66 countries across the six continents (source: World Health

74

Organization report, accessed March 3th, 2020).

75

Despite the worldwide rapid spread, the genomic variation dynamics,

76

evolutionary rate, and virus transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet well

77

understood. In several recent studies, phylogenetic relationships, variations,

78

evolutionary rates, and propagation dynamics were analyzed using limited genomic

79

data from the SARS-CoV-2 (Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020;

80

Benvenuto et al., 2020; Ceraolo et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Paraskevi et al., 2020;

81

Chan et al., 2020a, 2020b; Li et al., 2020a) . As the epidemic progresses, many

82

research institutes around the world have obtained and submitted SARS-CoV-2

83

genome sequences, increasing the number of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in the

84

Data Centers (i.e, GISAID). Given the extremely rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, an

85

updated analysis with significantly larger sample sizes by incorporating cases

86

throughout the world is urgently needed. This would allow for more accurate

87

identification of SARS-CoV-2 variant dynamics, evolutionary rates, virus

88

transmission dynamics, and epidemic history in order to effectively implement public

89

health measures, promote drugs and vaccines development and to efficiently prevent

90

similar epidemics in the future.

91

Recent research findings have suggested bat and other non-bat intermediate

92

mammals (such as pangolin) as potential intermediate host for the SARS-CoV-2 that

93

have so far been widely transmitted to humans (Lu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020;

94

Lam et al., 2020). According to the medical information of the first patients to be

95

infected in Wuhan, 27 out of 41 patients were found to be traders of wild mammals in

96

the Huanan seafood market, which directly suggests that the Huanan seafood market

97

as the possible source of origin of the SARS-CoV-2, and later got transmitted it to

98

other areas by the infected people (Huang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020b). However, due

99

to some infected persons having no relation or access to the Huanan food market,

100

some researchers are skeptical of the market as the only actual origin or the source of

101

SARS-CoV-2 transmission to humans (Cohen, 2020 ). Therefore, up to date, in the

102

absence of key potential intermediary host, the transmission pattern of SARS-CoV-2

103

still need to be thoroughly probed for a more reliable and accurate information on the

104

transmission mechanisms of the virus.

105

In this study, 56 full genome sequences of outgroups and 136 genomes of

106

SARS-CoV-2 from GISAID EpiFluTM database (access date 22 February 2020) were

107

collected. Ten new sequenced genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were obtained by

108

macrogenomic sequencing. The genetic diversity, transmission dynamics and

109

evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed based on the genomic data to

110

provide understanding on the transmission pathway, and evolutionary characteristics

In this study, ten patients with unexplained viral pneumonia from five hospitals

115

in Hubei Province were included. Four samples were collected in December, four in

116

January as well as two samples in February. The December samples were examined

117

by Light Cycle 480II fluorescent PCR instrument (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for

double-stranded DNA. The fragmenting, modifying the ends, connecting the joints

130

and enriching of DNA were done by NexteraXT library prepkit (Illumina, San Diego,

133

used for deep sequencing in Iseq100, Miseq, and Miniseq platforms (illumina, San

134

135

Using CLC Genomics Workbench 12 and Geneious 12.0.1 software (QIAGEN

136

Bioinformatics, Redwood City, CA, USA) and using reference sequence

137

BetaCoV/Wuhan-Hu-2019 (EPI ISL 402125), the raw sequencing data of Illumina

138

were analyzed.

139

Phylogenetic reconstructions

140

In this study, for probing the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 (Table S1),

141

136 complete genomes from GISAID (Table S1, access on 22 February, 2020) and

142

our new sequenced 10 genomes of this virus (GISAID, Table S1) were included. In

143

total, 56 outgroups were collected following the previous study (Lu et al., 2020).

144

Mafft v.7.450 was used to align the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 with reference

145

sequences (Katoh et al., 2013) . Phylogenetic analyses of the genomes were done with

146

RAxML v.8.2.9 (Stamatakis et al., 2014) in 1000 bootstrap replicates, employing the

147

general time reversible nucleotide substitution model. The tree was visualized with

148

FigTree v.1.4.3 (Rambaut et al., 2016).

149

Population structure

150

On this analysis technique, to precisely decode the evolutionary history of

151

SARS-CoV-2, the genome EPI ISL 402131 (bat-RaTG13-CoV) from GISAID was

152

also included as the outgroup following the previous study (Yu, et al., 2020 ), because

153

it is the closest sister betacoronavirus to SARS-CoV-2. The 136 complete genome

154

sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and an outgroup (bat-RaTG13-CoV) were aligned using

155

MAFFT then the alignment was manually checked using Geneious. For probing the

156

haplotypes relationships among localities, the Network v.4.6.1 (Fluxus Technology,

157

Suffolk, UK) was used to construct the minimum-spanning network based on the full

158

median-joining algorithm (Bandelt et al., 1999) . During the alignment, 10 genomes

159

containing ambiguous sites or “N” bases or more degenerated bases were excluded in

160

this study (Table S1). In addition, 4 genome sequences (EPI ISL 409067, EPI ISL

161

412981, EPI ISL 407071 and EPI ISL 408489) with one degenerated base were

162

included, which were divided into two sequences without degenerated base. For

163

ensuring the accuracy of this analysis, the 5’UTR and 3’UTR contain missing and

164

ambiguous sites of both regions were excluded in the following alignment analyses.

165

DnaSP v.5.10 (Librado et al., 2009) was used to convert the relevant format.

166

Population genetic indices in was estimated in DnaSP, including nucleotide diversity

167

(π) and haplotype diversity (Hd). FST between haplotypes was calculated in Mega 6.0

168

based on haplotype frequency differences with 10,000 permutations (Tamura et al.,

169

2013). Additionally, a sliding window of 500 bp and steps of 50 bp were used to show

170

nucleotide diversity (π) for the entire alignment this data. Nucleotide diversity for the

171

entire alignment was plotted against midpoint positions of each window. To indicate

172

the relative position of the mutations in the genome, we selected the EPI ISL 402124

173

sequence as the reference genome.

174

Population demography

175

The alignment was then imported into DnaSP for haplotype analyses. Population

176

size changes were estimated based on a constant population size hypothesis using

177

DnaSP, in combination with neutrality tests (Tajima’s D and Fu’s Fs). The mismatch

178

distribution was estimated based on the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 in Arlequin to test

179

the hypothesis of recent population growth. The Harpending's raggedness index (Rag)

180

and the sum of squares deviation (SSD) were used to determine the smoothness of

181

observed mismatch distribution and the degree of fit between observed and simulated

182

data (Harpending, 1994). Because of the sensitivity to demographic changes of

183

neutral tests, Tajima’s D (Tajima, 1989) and Fu's Fs (Fu, 1997) were estimated using

184

10,000 coalescent simulations to assess the significance in Arlequin. In addition, the

185

Extended Bayesian skyline plot (EBSP) analysis was conducted to examine past

186

population dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 based on 146 genomes by BEAST v.1.8

187

(Drummond et al., 2012). The divergence times were estimated in BEAST using a

188

Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with a strict clock. In this

189

study, the substitution rate was set as 0.92×10-3 (95% CI, 0.33×10-3-1.46×10-3)

190

substitution/site/year based on the most recent estimation for SARS-CoV-2 (Yu et al.,

191

2020). The other parameters were set as follows: extended Bayesian skyline process,

192

10 million MCMC generations, sampling every 1,000th iteration, the initial 25%

193

burn-in. Tracer was used to check the convergence of the MCMC analyses (effective

194

sample size [ESS] values >200).

Results and discussion

196

Genomic variations of SARS-CoV-2

197

According to the database, the genome size of SARS-CoV-2 varied from 29,409

198

bp to 29,911 bp. In the network dataset, the aligned matrix was 29,130 bp in length

199

including 183 variable sites, of which 27 were parsimony-informative and 156 were

200

singletons, which were classified as 80 haplotypes (Table S2). Nucleotide diversity (π)

201

was 0.16×10-3 ± 0.02×10-3 (Standard Deviation, SD) and haplotype diversity (Hd) was

202

0.954 ± 0.013 (SD) and variance of Hd was 0.16×10-3 (Table S3). In this study, our

203

new sequenced 10 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 represented 10 haplotypes (H3, H8, H10,

204

H14, H16, H28, H29, H30, H76 and H78; Table S1). Among these 10 genomes, four

205

samples were collected from those patients who had been exposed to the Huanan

206

seafood market in Wuhan. Additionally, the HBCDC-HB-03/2019 belonged to the

207

core H3 haplotype and most of them represented new haplotype. Sliding window

208

analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed significant regional variation across the alignment

209

(Fig. 1). The plot readily showed a relative high degree of nucleotide variation

210

amongst the aligned SARS-CoV-2 genomes for any given window of 500 bp and

211

steps of 50 bp, with the π ranging from 0.00005 to 0.0014. Additionally, based on the

212

curve, there were several relative high variation area, compared with other fragments

213

(Fig. 1). The FST analyses among 80 haplotypes ranged from 0.00003 (e.g, H3 and H9;

214

H14 and H15; H3 and H20) to 0.00134 (H19 and H80), which indicated genetic

215

differentiation among these haplotypes (Fig. 2, Table S4). Overall, the H19 showed

216

relatively large genetic distance with other haplotypes, while the H3 showed opposite

217

pattern, and was also confirmed by the network figure (Fig. 2, Table S4). Overall,

218

SARS-CoV-2 maintain the relatively rich mutations that has occurred across the

219

world.

220

Phylogenetic relationship of SARS-CoV-2

221

The virus's popularity and its intermediate host has been a topic of great concern.

222

Some researchers have suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 originated from the bats (Lu

223

et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). However, some other researchers have proposed that

224

the non-bat intermediate mammals (e.g. pangolins) may be the transmission path of

225

this genus (Lam et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020). Other studies have

226

also failed to confirm the pangolins as the intermediate host to this viral genus ((Liu et

227

al., 2020). In this study, based on the phylogenetic tree, bat-RaTG13-CoV was the

228

sister group to the SARS-CoV-2 and the two pangolin samples collected from

229

Guangdong which showed a relatively large genetic distance from the SARS-CoV-2

230

(Fig. 3 and S1). Based on this finding, the study suggested that pangolin may not be

231

the transmission path of the SARS-CoV-2, as had been reiterated by other previous

232

study (Liu et al., 2020). Notably, previous studies have shown that Malayan pangolins

233

could act as potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 (Lam et al., 2020; Xiao et al.,

234

2020). Therefore, more sampling and analysis of the sample across the world may

235

suggest clearer results for more concrete conclusions in future studies.

236

Evolutionary relationships of SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes

237

The evolutionary network of 80 haplotypes of SARS-CoV-2, with bat-RaTG13-CoV

238

as the outgroup, is shown in Figure 4. The network analysis showed typical star

239

network, with several core haplotype node (H3, H14, H15) and edge haplotype nodes.

240

(Fig. 4 and Table S1). In the network, fifty-five satellite haplotypes and H14

241

connected to the H3 haplotype; eighteen satellite haplotypes and H15+H3 connected

242

to the H14 haplotype; and five satellite haplotypes and H14 connected to H15. Most

243

of these haplogroups were separated by one to six mutations, except two haplotypes

244

(H19 and H80, Fig. 4). The evolutionary network showed that bat-RaTG13-CoV to be

245

connected through a hypothesized haplotype (mv6) to the H15 and H31 haplotypes by

246

bat-RaTG13-CoV was more than 1,200, which indicated that SARS-CoV-2 still has a

In this study, 16 sequences of Huanan seafood market (4 new sequenced and 12

250

GISAID data) were collected. Fifteen of the sixteen samples were collected before 1st

251

Januray, 2020 and one samples was collected on 8th Januray, 2020. These samples

252

were represented ten haplotypes (H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7, H8, H10, H11, H16),

253

which indicated the high proportion of haplotype diversity in Huanan seafood market.

254

Among those haplotypes, the H3 haplotype, the most abundant, was present in 6

255

samples from Huanan seafood market, while the other haplotypes were directly

256

derived from the H3 haplotype. All the samples from the Huanan seafood market had

257

the H3 haplotype and other 9 derived haplotypes (Fig. 4), indicating that there were

258

circulated infections within the market in a short term. Additionally, in the network, a

259

total of 65 virus samples from 15 other countries were assigned to 43 haplotypes.

260

Among them, 27 haplotypes were satellite haplotypes of H3 haplotype, 11 haplotypes

261

were satellite haplotypes of H14 haplotype, and 3 haplotypes were satellite haplotype

262

of H15 haplotype. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 had diverse haplotypes

263

around the world .

264
265

Based on the outgroup (bat-RaTG13-CoV) having a possible direct connection

266

with outgroup H15 and H31, it indicates that both the H15 and H31 were the

267

suggested ancestral haplotypes (Fig. 4), as had also been suggested by other previous

268

study (Yu et al., 2020) . The H15 was only recovered from five Shenzhen (Guangdong)

269

samples, while H31 included 3 United States samples and 1 Fujian sample from China

270

(Fig. 4). Based on the epidemiological statistics, all the patients from the H15 were

271

ever traveled to Wuhan (Chan et al., 2020b). As to the H31, three genomes from the

272

same patient in Unite State (Holshue et al., 2020) and 1 genome from Fujian of China

273

(Table S1) were included. For the patient in Unite State, he may have infected during

274

the period of visiting his family in China, or was infected in some other place (Yu et

275

al., 2020). Based on the theory in the previous study (Yu et al., 2020), this current

276

study also supported two main evolutionary paths, that the available haplotypes could

277

be from H15 through H14 to H3, or from H31 through H14 to H3 (Fig. 4). Both these

278

two path demonstrate that H14 was the key connection from an ancestral haplotype to

279

H3. However, in H14, only two individuals (EPI ISL 406801 and EPI ISL 412979)

280

were collected from Wuhan and the others were not related to Wuhan. The two

281

individuals (EPI ISL 406801 and EPI ISL 412979) were not directly link with the

282

Huanan seafood market.

Cohen (2020) had argued that Wuhan seafood market may not be source of novel

284

virus spreading globally, or at least not be a single source of SARS-CoV-2 (Cohen et

285

al., 2020). In addition, other studies have shown similar results (Yu et al., 2020;

286

Forster et al., 2020). Due to lacking of early samples and important epidemiological

287

clues across the world, in this study, we only can infer similar conclusions based on

288

the outgroup genome (bat-RaTG13-CoV). On the other hand, some studies had

289

proved that Median-joining network analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes is neither

290

phylogenetic nor evolutionary, which indicated that misleads more than illuminates an

291

understanding

292

(Sánchez-Pacheco et al., 2020). Meantime, sampling bias and incorrect rooting make

293

phylogenetic network may led to the unreliable tracing of SARS-COV-2 infections

294

(Mavian et al., 2020). The outgroup is very distant from current SARS-COV-2

295

sequences, although approximately 1200 substitutions were observed, there could be

296

more than 1200 mutations actually occurred, thus ancestral inferences using this

297

outgroup could be misleading. Hence, in view of many factors that impact on the

accurate

and more powerful analysis methods, indicating the later work direction.

Population size expansion of SARS-CoV-2

302

As to population demography of SARS-CoV-2, the EBSP results revealed that it

303

experienced an expansion of effective population size for the last 66 days prior to 11th

304

of February, 2020 (Fig. 5). With the latest one being sampled on 11th February 2020,

305

the first expansion date is estimated to had begun from 7th December 2019. The

306

mismatch in the distribution of the total populations was also clearly shown through

307

unimodal (Fig. 6) and the neutral tests (Tajima’s D and Fu’s Fs) revealed statistically

308

significant population expansion of SARS-CoV-2 (Table S3), which also supported

309

the EBSP results. In addition, with the change of time, multiple evidence (i.e.

310

haplotype number, Tajima's D, Fu's FS) indicated a relatively highest population

311

growth at around 21st - 27th of January (Table S3). In early December 2019, the first

313

most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) dates for SARS-CoV-2 at 6th December,

2019) (Li et al., 2020a). Additionally, considering that the virus has longest reported

315

incubation period of up to 24 days (Guan et al., 2020), the virus may had first infected

316

humans in mid to late November, which is basically consistent with the results of

317

previous studies (Yu et al., 2020). Therefore, in this study, EBSP revealed that

318

SARS-CoV-2 experienced an effective population size expansion since 7th December

319

2019, which was also supported by a star-like network, EBSP, the neutral tests (Fu's

320

and Tajima's D test) and mismatch analysis.

Conclusion

323

Coronavirus is a large viruses family, known to cause more serious diseases such as

324

SARS, MERS, etc. SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of coronavirus which has never been

325

found in human before, which is extremely infectious and harmful to people.

326

study, we used 10 new sequenced genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and combined 136

327

genomes from GISAID database to investigate the genetic variation and population

328

demography. The relative high genetic diversity were disclosed by the mutations

329

abundance, which indicated diverse haplotypes around the world. Compared with the

330

coronavirus carried by pangolins (Pangolin-CoV), the virus carried by bats

331

(bat-RaTG13-CoV) has a closer relationship with SARS-CoV-2. A circulating

Fig. 4. Median-joining network with node sizes proportional to the frequencies of

504

haplotypes in SARS-CoV-2. All the individuals collected before 11th February in

505

2019. The numbers of mutations separating the haplotypes are shown on the branches,

506

except for the lower than seven-step mutations. The little red diamond nodes indicate

507

undetected haplotypes. The sampling areas are indicated by different colors.

Fig. 5. Population fluctuation infered by Extended bayesian skyline plot (EBSP)

511

of SARS-CoV-2. The x-axis indicates time in days BP, and the y-axis indicates the

512

effective population size divided by generation time in units of Neτ (the product of

513

effective population size and generation time in days). The blue areas represent 95 %

514

highest posterior density. Time is expressed in days.
