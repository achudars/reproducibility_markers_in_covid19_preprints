Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has swept over the world in the past months, causing
significant loss of life and consequences to human health. Although numerous drug and vaccine
developments efforts are underway, many questions remain outstanding on the mechanism of
SARS-CoV-2 viral association to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), its main host
receptor, and entry in the cell. Structural and biophysical studies indicate some degree of
flexibility in the viral extracellular Spike glycoprotein and at the receptor binding domainreceptor interface, suggesting a role in infection. Here, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics
simulations of the glycosylated, full-length membrane-bound ACE2 receptor, in both an apo and
spike receptor binding domain (RBD) bound state, in order to probe the intrinsic dynamics of the
ACE2 receptor in the context of the cell surface. A large degree of fluctuation in the full length
structure is observed, indicating hinge bending motions at the linker region connecting the head
to the transmembrane helix, while still not disrupting the ACE2 homodimer or ACE2-RBD
interfaces. This flexibility translates into an ensemble of ACE2 homodimer conformations that
could sterically accommodate binding of the spike trimer to more than one ACE2 homodimer,
and suggests a mechanical contribution of the host receptor towards the large spike
conformational changes required for cell fusion. This work presents further structural and
functional insights into the role of ACE2 in viral infection that can be exploited for the rational
design of effective SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.

Statement of Significance
As the host receptor of SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 has been the subject of extensive structural
and antibody design efforts in aims to curtail COVID-19 spread. Here, we perform molecular
dynamics simulations of the homodimer ACE2 full-length structure to study the dynamics of this
protein in the context of the cellular membrane. The simulations evidence exceptional plasticity
in the protein structure due to flexible hinge motions in the head-transmembrane domain linker
region and helix mobility in the membrane, resulting in a varied ensemble of conformations
distinct from the experimental structures. Our findings suggest a dynamical contribution of
ACE2 to the spike glycoprotein shedding required for infection, and contribute to the question of
stoichiometry of the Spike-ACE2 complex.

Introduction
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) acts as the extracellular receptor for the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1–3), the virus responsible for the
COVID-19 pandemic that has catastrophically affected the world since its first identification in
December 2019 (4–7). ACE2 is a membrane protein found in lungs, kidneys, heart and intestine
cells (8, 9) that plays a physiological role in cardiovascular regulation via the cleaving of
intermediates in the maturation process of angiotensin, a peptide hormone involved in
vasoconstriction control (10–14). ACE2 is a homodimer with a large claw-like extracellular head
domain, a small transmembrane domain and a short intracellular segment (8). The head can be
further subdivided into the catalytic zinc-binding peptidase domain (PD, residues 19 to 615)
(15), and the smaller neck domain (residues 616 to 726), which is where the majority of the
homodimer interactions seems to lie (16). The neck domain is further connected to the singlehelix transmembrane (TM) domain by a long linker (Figure 1a). ACE2 can also function as a
membrane-trafficking chaperone for B0AT1, an amino acid transporter (17), and it was in fact
only in complex with this partner that the single TM helix of ACE2 could be resolved (16).

SARS-CoV (18) (responsible for 8096 cases in 2002 (19)) and now the closely related
SARS-CoV-2 hijack ACE2 as the host cell receptor to its large extracellular spike (S)
glycoprotein (1, 20). The spike’s receptor binding domain (RBD) in the “up” conformation binds
to ACE2’s PD with high affinity (21), and the resolved ACE2-RBD complex consists of a dimer
of heterodimers, with each monomer of the ACE2 homodimer interacting with one RBD (thus
forming a heterodimer, Figure 1a). Cellular recognition and binding to ACE2’s peptidase domain
via the RBD is proposed to initiate a series of complex conformational transitions in the S
homotrimeric protein, leading to the shedding of its S1 subunit and fusion to the host cell

membrane driven by the S2 subunit (22–26), ultimately resulting in the infection of the host cell.
Downregulation of ACE2 and accumulation of angiotensin II due to spike binding is also
associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung failure (27–31),
contributing to SARS-associated symptoms. As such, the S glycoprotein and ACE2-S complex
are considered key targets for drug and antibody development efforts aiming to curtail the virus’
remarkable transmissibility and negative effect on human health (1, 32–35), including exploiting
the ACE2-S high affinity with recombinant soluble ACE2-antibody constructs (35–38).
Experimental and biophysical studies of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and soluble ACE2’s PD
complex have suggested structural factors likely responsible for the higher affinity and
infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV (39–41), and revealed significant dynamics
at the RBD-PD interface (41, 42). Additionally, cryoEM and computational studies of the fulllength spike glycoprotein have recently suggested a significant degree of flexibility of the spike’s
stalk and at the ACE2-RBD interface (43, 44), evidencing the need to study these
macromolecular complexes in the context of the cell surface instead of in static, cryogenic
conditions. Here, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the full length,
membrane-embedded and glycosylated ACE2 homodimer both in the apo state and in complex
with RBD to study the molecular origins of the ACE2-S flexibility on the host receptor side.
Seven complex N-glycans and one O-glycan in ACE2 were modeled according to glycoanalytic
data (45–47), as well as glycan N343 in RBD for the RBD-bound simulations (Figure 1b). The
B0AT1 transporter solved in the cryo-EM structure was not included in our simulations in order
to inform on the intrinsic dynamics of ACE2. B0AT1 is mainly expressed in kidneys and
intestines (48), whereas ACE2 can also be found in lungs and heart tissues, supporting the
likelihood that ACE2 can be found un-complexed with B0AT1 upon cellular recognition and
binding to S.
The simulations reveal an exceptional structural plasticity of the full-length ACE2
homodimer, pinpointing a large tilting of the head relative to the TM domain, as well as profuse
mobility of the TM helix in the membrane. Remarkably, the homodimer interface at the level of
the neck domains remains stable despite the dramatic motions, as well as the ACE2-RBD
contacts, emphasizing the high affinity interaction between them. A systematic characterization
of glycan-protein and glycan-glycan contacts indicates a possible role of glycan N53 in both
homodimer and heterodimer interactions. Overall, the RBD does not seem to significantly affect

the dynamics of ACE2 compared to the apo state, although that might differ in the presence of
the full-length spike. Taken together, the remarkable ACE2 flexibility indicates a mechanical
contribution to the S1/S2 conformational changes required for cellular fusion and infection, and
suggests the structural basis for the possibility of finding two or more ACE2 complexes bound to
the same S glycoprotein with two or more “RBD-up” conformations.

Methods
ACE2 system construction
Coordinates of the ACE2-RBD complex were taken from the full length cryo-EM
structure, PDB ID 6M17 (16), removing the coordinates from the co-complexed B0AT1 dimer.
Missing C terminal residues of the ACE2 transmembrane helices were modeled using I-TASSER
(49–51) based on the known sequence (residues 769 to 805), while missing N terminal residue
coordinates (residues 19 to 21) were copied from 6M0J following alignment of the N terminal
helix. Zinc coordinating residues and a coordinating water molecule were taken from 1R42 as
the zinc coordination site is poorly resolved in 6M17.
ACE2 and RBD glycosylation was defined according to glycoanalytic data (45, 47) and
modeled using the Glycan Reader & Modeler tool (52) integrated into Glycan Reader (53) in
CHARMM-GUI (54). In total, 7 complex, bi-antennary N glycans and 1 O glycan were added to
ACE2, as well as 1 N glycan to RBD (Supplementary Table 1). Only one O glycan was included
at site 730 as analytic data suggest extremely low stoichiometry at the other O glycosylation sites
(46). The apo ACE2 model was created by deleting the RBDs of the complete ACE2-RBD
model.

Membrane modeling
The plasma membrane modeled in this study was composed of 56% POPC, 20% CHL,
11% POPI, 9% POPE, and 4% PSM. The lipid composition was estimated based on the known
lipid compositions of mammalian cellular membranes (55, 56). It is hypothesized that
phospholipids containing charged headgroups such as PI and PS are more likely to face the
cytoplasmic side of the membrane and are additionally thought to aid in tolerance of increased
membrane curvature (55). Using a precedent set by a 2014 coarse-grained molecular dynamics
study of the asymmetrical mammalian plasma membrane, the lipids were partitioned according

to the outer versus inner leaflet enrichment factors of 2.0, 1.2, 0.0, 0.25, and 2.0 for POPC, CHL,
POPI, POPE, and PSM, respectively (56). To reduce the chemical complexity of the system for
simulation purposes, PS lipids were not included in these calculations. The small percentage
(4%) of PS recorded in the literature is represented in the membrane by PI lipids.
An asymmetric 350 Å x 350 Å lipid bilayer according to the above specifications was
generated using CHARMM-GUI’s input generator (54). The lipids were packed to an
approximate equilibrium area per lipid of 63 Å2. Prior to insertion of ACE2 and subsequent
trimming, the membrane patch contained a total of 2,432 POPC, 870 CHL, 460 POPI, 404
POPE, and 128 PSM lipids.

System preparation and molecular dynamics simulations
Histidine protonation states at pH 7.0 were verified using PROPKA on Maestro
(Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY). The models were parametrized using PSFGEN and
CHARMM36 all-atom additive force fields for protein, lipids, and glycans (57), fully solvated in
TIP3P water boxes (58) with 150 mM NaCl. The total number of atoms is 738,696 for the apo
system (size: 18.7 nm × 18.9 nm × 23.7 nm) and 783,954 for the RBD-bound system (size: 18.7
nm × 18.9 nm × 25.1 nm).
Minimization, equilibration and production simulations were performed on the Frontera
computing system at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) using NAMD 2.14 (59), as
described in detail in Casalino et al (60). Each system was run in triplicates for 1s each.

ACE2 angles and distances calculations
To quantify the range of motion of ACE2 in the simulations, several angle and distance
metrics were developed. Calculation was performed using MDTraj (61) with visualization
through VMD (62). The 6M17 cryo-EM structure was used as the reference structure.
Head tilt angle relative to the transmembrane domain was calculated by first aligning the
dimer’s coordinates to the reference cryo-EM TM domains, and angle calculated between the
centers of mass of the reference’s dimer peptidase domains (residues 18 to 600), reference’s TM
helices (residues 747 to 774), and monomer’s PD at each frame in the simulation. Helix tilt angle
was computed as the angle between a vector defining the membrane’s normal and a vector
connecting residues 741 and 765 at the extremities of the helix.

Revolution angle was calculated between the center of mass of the monomer’s PD in the
reference conformation, the center of mass of the reference’s TM domain, and the center of mass
of the monomer’s PD at each frame in the simulation following alignment of the monomer’s TM
helices. Buckling angle was calculated using the xy projections of the center of mass of
monomer’s A PD at frame f, the center of mass of the reference dimer’s PDs, and center of mass
of monomer’s B PD at frame f, after alignment of the trajectories to the reference dimer neck
domains (residues 617 to 726).
Distance between the monomer’s head domains in the homodimer was calculated by
determining the distance between each monomer’s PD center of mass. Distance between the
head domain and membrane corresponds to the minimum distance between the PD’s heavy
atoms and membrane’s phosphorous atoms at each frame of the simulation. Distance between
TM helices was calculated based on the distance between their centers of mass.

Fraction of native contacts and glycan contacts
Fraction of native contacts was calculated according to Mehdipour and Hummer (63).
The 6M17 cryo-EM structure was used as the reference structure for identification of native
contacts. The ACE2-RBD interface was subdivided into three interacting regions according to
the interacting residues pairs listed on Supplementary Table 2.
A systematic characterization of contacts established by each glycan in the system was
performed using MDTraj (61), using a cutoff of 3.5 Å between the heavy atoms.

S model construction
The spike model was obtained from our previous simulations (60). The simulations
included only the solvated spike. All atoms except for the spike protein and glycans were
removed, along with the lower part of the stalk region of each protomer (residues 11651273). Since the cryo-EM model was missing density for portions of the RBD, we replaced the
RBD coordinates (residues 355 to 494 for closed RBD, 339 to 523 for open RBD) of each
protomer in both models with the RBD coordinates from the crystal structure of the RBD bound
to ACE2 (PDB 6M0J (64)). The RBD structure from 6M0J was aligned with the backbone heavy
atoms (alpha-carbon, carbonyl-carbon, and nitrogen) of each RBD in the initial spike model. We
then grafted the RBD coordinates onto the spike at the hinge region , which resolved missing

loops as well as introducing a disulfide bond in the RBD. The remaining disulfides not resolved
in the cryoEM structures were assessed based on distance criteria and sequence conservation.
The system was built using the ff14SBonlysc (65) and GLYCAM (66) force fields for the protein
and glycan atoms, respectively. These were explicitly solvated in OPC3 water (67) with a 200
mM NaCl buffer (68). The RBD-up and -down systems both consisted of 1,298,646 atoms, and
were simulated on Frontera at TACC, and SDCC at BNL using the pmemd.CUDA module of
Amber20. The spike systems were equilibrated using a 10-step protocol. First, the water
molecules were minimized for 1,000 steps using steepest descent, and then for an additional
9,000 steps with conjugate gradient while the rest of the system was positionally restrained with
1 kcal/( mol * Å2) restraints. The systems were then heated to 310 K at constant volume, again
with all atoms except hydrogens and waters restrained with 100 kcal/(mol * Å2) positional
restraints. The box size and density were then equilibrated over 1 ns with constant pressure, with
the same positional restraints as the previous step. The restraints were then lowered to 10
kcal/(mol*A) for an additional 1 ns of equilibration, before a second minimization. This
minimization consisted of 10,000 steps of conjugate gradient with positional restraints now
applied only to only backbone atoms (alpha-carbon, carbonyl-carbon, and nitrogen), using a
force constant of 10 kcal/(mol * Å2). The next three steps of equilibration were MD for 1 ns each
at constant NPT with positional restraints on protein backbone atoms at 10, 1, and 0.1 kcal/(mol
* Å2), respectively. This was followed by a final 1 ns of unrestrained MD at constant NPT before
beginning production.
To generate a 3-up model of the prefusion spike protein, steered molecular dynamics
(SMD) was used as implemented in the Amber NFE toolkit (69). The initial structure was an allclosed model from the equilibration described above. To generate a structure used as reference
for steering, the open monomer from the 1-up model was aligned to the other two closed
monomers by overlapping S2 domains. The closed RBD domains were then replaced with the
open model of the aligned monomer. No equilibration was performed on the resulting reference
structure since it was not subjected to simulations, and only used as a steering target. Root mean
squared deviation (RMSD) was used as the collective variable (CV) to guide SMD. A separate
CV was used for the opening of each RBD. In each CV, the RMSD region includes the RBD
(residue 338 - 517) and 3 helices in S2 (residue 747 – 782, 946 – 966, 987 - 1034). The 3
RMSDs were gradually decreased by SMD from their initial values to 0 during 20 ns of

simulation time at 310K in the NVT ensemble, with a 4fs time step enabled by hydrogen mass
repartitioning (70), using a spring constant of 10000 kcal/mol/Å2. Weak (1 kcal/mol/Å2)
positional restraints were applied to the S2 helices, which were relatively stable during SMD
simulations.

Results
The ACE2 dimer shows pronounced flexibility
Simulations of RBD-bound and apo ACE2 evidenced a striking degree of flexibility in
the ACE2 homodimer. With respect to the fairly vertical, extended conformation of the initial
cryo-EM structure (16), the most striking fluctuation observed during the simulations is
characterized by a tilt of the head relative to the long axis of the respective monomer’s
transmembrane helix. While each monomer in the reference cryo-EM structure displays a tilt
angle of 16°, structures in the simulations sample tilt angles that range from 0° to 50° (Figure 2a
and d). This tilt motion, combined with an overall “shrinking” of the initial extended
conformation, moves the head towards the membrane, with head-membrane distances varying
from 30 to 84 Å and the great majority of conformations (98% and 98.6% of the frames of apo
and RBD-bound simulations, respectively) exhibiting the head domain closer to the membrane
than the starting cryo-EM structure (Figure 2b). The presence of the RBD does not seem to affect
the dynamics, with apo and RBD-bound simulations showing average head-membrane distances
of 59.1±6.9 Å and 56.5±8.8 Å, respectively.

Remarkably, the head tilt motion occurs in a concerted fashion between the monomers,
such that as one monomer bends towards the membrane, with large tilt angle values, the other
monomer follows this deformation by adopting a more extended conformation with lower angle
values (Figure 2e, Supplementary Figure 1). Accordingly, the distance between the head

domains fluctuates only slightly, varying by no more than 6 Å (Figure 2c) and resulting in a
stable relative position of the heads within the homodimer. The majority of the conformations
display the two heads slightly closer to each other than in the resolved cryo-EM structure, while
the presence of the spike RBD shifts the distribution slightly towards more open conformations.
In concert with the tilt motion described above, the ACE2 head also undergoes
displacement in the xy plane around the long axis of the TM helix, as shown for one of the
replicas in Figure 3a. Computation of each monomer’s revolution angle suggests a twisting of
the flexible linker that connects the neck to the TM domain, with several significant alternative
conformations exhibiting almost 180 degrees rotation of the head from its starting position
(Figure 3b). It is important to highlight that the head revolution is measured here for each
monomer independently, following an alignment of that monomer’s transmembrane domain. As
the monomer’s TM helices are not in contact with each other and thus can move independently
in the membrane (Figure 4a), the twisting motion of one of the monomers is not necessarily
accompanied by an equivalent twist of the other monomer, avoiding a twist of the flexible linkers
around each other. Instead, visual observation indicates that the other monomer revolves as a
whole around the transmembrane helix of the twisting monomer (Supplementary Figure 2),
keeping the head dimer interface overall intact. Thus, despite this pronounced motion, the other
monomer follows the twist by retaining the heads’ symmetry, and the relative angle between the
heads in the xy plane remains close to the initial 180° (Figure 3c).

The simulations indicate that the conformational variability of ACE2 occurs not only due
to flexibility at the linker connecting the transmembrane and head domains, but also due to
motions of the transmembrane helix in the membrane. In contrast to other multimeric

transmembrane domains such as the coiled coil trimer of S (21, 26, 60), each ACE2 monomer is
anchored to the membrane by a single helix, which does not interact with that of the opposing
monomer (Figure 4a), but rather explores a range of tilt angles relative to the membrane’s normal
(Figure 4b).

The overall gaussian distributions of the distances and angles measured here emphasize a
continuous sampling of the distinct conformations, with no significant energy barriers hindering
the transitions. Combined with the bi-directional tilting of each monomer (Supplementary Figure
1), the simulations indicate that the deformations occur transiently and with no preferred
direction or conformation. Taken together, our results suggest that the experimentally resolved
extended ACE2 structure is likely not a dominant conformation in solution, and the homodimer
displays a large ensemble of conformations in the native state.

ACE2-RBD interface remains stable despite the large ACE2 motions
Despite the dramatic flexibility of the ACE2 dimer, the RBD included in the RBD-bound
model retained a large fraction of the native contacts with ACE2 throughout the simulations,
with an average fraction of 0.87 ± 0.11 contacts. While the interface is thus overall stable, and
the relatively small RBDs accompany the range of motion of ACE2, dividing the RBD-ACE2
interface into three interacting regions (comprising of the two RBD loop regions at the opposite
sides of the dimer interface and the central region containing the two short b sheet strands,
Figure 5a) we observe that the central region 2 contains the most stable contacts, while regions 1
and 3 at the extremities of the interface are less tightly bound and sample states with a smaller
number of native contacts (Figure 5b). This rocking motion is in agreement with dynamics at the
PD-RBD interface observed in other simulations (41, 42).
In addition to protein interactions, five glycans in ACE2 are in close proximity to the
RBD and have been suggested to play a role in S binding. In agreement with other studies (46,
63), N90 and to a lesser extent N322 of ACE2 establish contacts with RBD. Besides these
glycans, we also find that N53 can form a large number of contacts with the RBD residues, while
the RBD glycan N343 makes very few contacts with ACE2’s head protein residues (Figure 5c)
or glycans (Supplementary Figure 3).

N53 is involved in both homodimer and heterodimer contacts
Besides the ACE2-RBD heterodimer interface, we considered the interactions within
ACE2 that could contribute to maintaining such a stable homodimer head interface despite the

pronounced flexibility of the protein (Figures 2e and 3e). Experimental structures and
simulations suggest that the majority of the protein contacts in the homodimer are located in the
neck domain, with only two other interactions, in the form of hydrogen bonds, observed in the
larger peptidase domain (16, 63). In agreement with these observations, we find that the dimer
interface is mainly held together in the simulations by residues at the neck (Figure 6a for RBDbound simulations and Supplementary Figure 4a for apo). Computation of the glycan-protein and
glycan-glycan contacts enrich the characterization of the inter- and intra-monomer interactions
and suggest that, while the eight ACE2 glycans form several contacts with protein residues
located within the same monomer (Figure 6b), protein-glycan interactions with the opposite
monomer are limited to N53 and N690 (Figure 6c). Additionally, N53 is the only glycan that can
be found to form inter-monomer glycan-glycan contacts, established between the equivalent N53
copies in each of the monomers (Figure 6d and Supplementary Figure 5). Similarly to the lack of
RBD effect on the ACE2 dimer flexibility, we find that the homodimer contact distributions are
comparable between apo and RBD-bound states of ACE2 (Supplementary Figure 3).

Our systematic analysis of all glycan interactions thus indicate that N53 is the only
glycan involved in both heterodimer (ACE2-RBD, Figure 5c) and homodimer (intra ACE2
dimer, Figure 6d) interactions. The opposite positions of the homodimer and RBD interfaces
relative to N53 (Figure 5e) could suggest a competition for N53 contacts within these dimer
interfaces. Indeed, we find that when a large number of N53-RBD contacts are formed, the N53
dimer interface is abrogated in the RBD-bound simulations, and vice versa (Supplementary
Figure 6b). However, these interactions are not completely mutually exclusive as N53’ (the N53

glycan in monomer B) can be found involved in both inter-monomer and monomer-RBD
interactions in Replica 1. This glycan’s flexibility probably plays a role in conferring a transient
nature to the interactions, as the N53 homodimer contacts are not consistently formed even in the
absence of the competing heterodimer in the apo ACE2 simulations (Supplementary Figure 6a).
Thus, N53 can still be found highly solvent exposed in the apo state, suggesting optimal
conformations for contact with an RBD partner and a role in S binding and infection.
Finally, as the large tilt motion of the ACE2 homodimer can bring the head domains in
close contact to the membrane (Figure 1e), we also investigated the possible involvement of the
glycans in interactions with the membrane polar heads. Although N103, N432 and N690 can
establish up to 10 contacts at once with the membrane, we find that only O730, the glycan
located closest to the membrane even in the elongated conformation, makes significant contacts
with the lipids (Supplementary Figure 7), thus suggesting that ACE2’s glycans do not promote or
stabilize the bent conformations.

Discussion
All-atom simulations of apo and RBD-bound, full-length, membrane embedded ACE2
show a striking degree of fluctuation of the homodimer protein, which can be attributed to hinge
motions of the large head domain relative to the transmembrane helices, and tilt of the
transmembrane helices relative to the membrane’s normal. The head relative motion is due to the
flexible linker region connecting the TM helix and the neck domain, while the TM helix motion
points to a loose anchoring of ACE2 to the membrane. While the two (head and transmembrane)
domains are internally stable, the flexibility of the connecting loop virtually results in a
decoupling of these domains’ dynamics (Figure 7a), leading to sampling of conformations
strikingly different than the experimentally-observed elongated structure (16). A high
deformation propensity was also observed for the TM-neck linker upon normal model analysis of
full-length ACE2 (71). These distinct conformations were likely only observed in the simulations
due to the removal of B0AT1 from the co-complexed structure, since they seem to bind on
opposite sides of the homodimer transmembrane interface and interact with the flexible linker
(16). However, the expression profiles of ACE2 and B0AT1 suggests the likelihood of ACE2
existing in the apo state, especially in lung and heart tissues where B0AT1 is not expressed (48).

A schematic of the membrane is indicated. (d) Detailed view of the ACE2 heads in (c), with N90
and N103 glycans highlighted.

Remarkably, the conformations of the ACE2 peptidase and neck domains remain stable
throughout the simulations, and the homodimer heads retain their relative orientation despite the
dramatic global homodimer motions. In a similar fashion, the RBDs included in the holo
simulations remained tightly bound to ACE2 throughout the simulations, evidencing the high
affinity between them. Glycan-glycan and glycan-protein interactions suggest that the ACE2
homodimer interface is maintained not only via protein interactions at the neck domain, but also
inter-monomer contacts involving N53, at the top of the PD, and N690, closer to the neck.
Interestingly, N53 also makes extensive contacts with RBD, suggesting a dual and possibly
competing role between homodimer (intra-ACE2) and heterodimer (ACE2-RBD) interactions.
This dual nature may be dependent on the length of the N53 glycan, but the glycosylation
heterogeneity in ACE2 in general and in this position in particular (47) supports the likelihood of
inter-monomer glycan interactions. Even in the absence of RBD, N53 alternates between being
sequestered in homodimer contact and being extended and highly solvent accessible, suggesting
a role in RBD binding to this glycan.
Due to the stability of the head domain and RBD interface in spite of ACE2 body motion,
this large flexibility would remain invisible in studies that do not take the full length character of
ACE2 into account, looking for instance at only the PD-RBD interactions. However, a recent
cryo-EM study of S-ACE2 PD complex resolved a continuous swing motion of the ACE2 headRBD relative to the S trimer body (44). These structural characterizations complement our
analysis and suggest how the ACE2 motion would translate in the context of full-length spike.
Additionally, it has been found from in-situ Cryo-EM and molecular dynamics simulations that
the spike glycoprotein also exhibits conformational plasticity, with hinge motions at three
different regions of the stalk trimer (43). Large dynamical variations thus seems to be a feature
of these extracellular glycoproteins. The RBD rocking motion and S conformational variability
have been proposed as mechanisms for immune evasion and efficient receptor search in the host
cell (43, 44) but the similar rocking motion of ACE2 we observed also suggests a mechanical
aspect to ACE2-S interaction. The process of S conformational transition upon binding to the
receptor and cell fusion remains elusive, but ACE2’s intrinsic flexibility could promote a large

swinging motion of the ACE2-S1 complex, providing a mechanical force for the approximation
of the two membranes and shedding of S1 towards fusion of the S2 domains into the receptor
cell (Figure 7b).
Finally, one can speculate that the flexibility of the host receptor might allow the
accommodation of more than one ACE2 dimer bound to a single S with two or more RBDs in
the up conformation. A high efficiency of ACE2 usage was suggested to contribute to SARSCoV transmissibility(15, 72), and thus could be at play for SARS-CoV-2 as well. To investigate
this possibility, we extracted a range of ACE2 conformations from the RBD-bound simulations
covering different tilt angles, and explored the alignment of these structures to a “three RBD-up”
spike model. Indeed, we find that two ACE2 dimers can sterically be accommodated by a single
spike, with inter-dimer backbone distances no smaller than 10 Å (Figure 7d). The flexibility of
the homodimers could potentially allow for even three ACE2’s per S, opening the possibility of
multi-receptor usage by the spike glycoprotein for host cell infection. Explicitly considering the
glycans in this aligned model evidences that N103 and especially N90 are in close proximity to
the neighboring ACE2 dimer (Figure 7c). Interestingly, it is known that disruption of the N90
glycosylation motif due to mutations leads to increased S-ACE2 binding affinity (72–74), and
these observations can thus provide the structural basis for the negative effect of N90 on RBD
binding.

Conclusions
All-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the full-length ACE2 inserted in a
mammalian-inspired lipid membrane uncover a significant degree of flexibility of the ACE2
homodimer with consequences for S-ACE2 interaction and SARS-CoV-2 infection, and suggest
the structural basis for glycan N90’s negative effect on RBD binding. Additionally, we identify
the involvement of glycan N53 in ACE2 homodimer and ACE2-RBD heterodimer contacts.
Taken together, our findings shed further light onto the mechanisms of viral binding and cell
entry required for rational design of effective SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.
