Abstract

28

The currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has accounted for

29

millions of infections and deaths across the globe. Genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are

30

being published daily in various forums and this big data availability has allowed

31

unprecedented access into the mutational patterns of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Genomic

32

information has further been utilised in public health decision making through molecular

33

epidemiology, transmission tracking and vaccine design. We made use of the same sea of

34

genomic information for conducting a detailed phylogenetic analysis and identifying lineage-

35

specific mutations. The catalogued mutations were analysed for their stabilizing or

36

destabilizing impact on E, M, N and S viral proteins that are key for infection, virulence and

37

pathogenesis. The same proteins make crucial components of vaccines recently approved and

38

in development. We recorded positive natural selection of D614G, S477N, A222V V1176F

39

variants and a global expansion of the PANGOLIN variant B.1. In addition, a positive natural

40

selection of Q57H (B.1.X), R203K/G204R (B.1.1.X), T85I (B.1.2-B.1.3), G15S+T428I

41

(C.X) and I120F (D.X) variants was observed. Overall, we recorded a striking balance

42

between stabilizing and destabilizing mutations, therefore incredibly well maintained protein

43

structures. With selection pressures in the form of newly developed vaccines and therapeutics

44

to mount soon in coming months, the task of mapping of viral mutations and recording of

45

their impact on key viral proteins would be crucial to pre-emptively catch any escape

46

mechanism that SARS-CoV-2 may evolve for.

Introduction

49

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in

50

Wuhan, China and the subsequent global spread has brought the world to a standstill (WHO,

51

2020). During the course of 11 months the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has

52

caused more than 72 million confirmed cases in 217 countries with close to 1,620,000

53

fatalities. (Worldometer 14/12/2020). While initially, and rightly too, the efforts were focused

54

on minimising the number of cases and deaths due to COVID-19 (WHO 2020). This included

55

fast tracking the search and development of novel treatment and prevention options (Li & De

56

Clercq, 2020). Today, however, as vaccine candidates have started showing promising

57

results, there is a cautious shift towards assessing the efficacy of vaccine candidates with

58

respect to the circulating diversity of SARS-CoV-2 and its continuously evolving genetic

59

variants (Hodgson et al., 2020).

60

Functional mutations that help the virus to adapt to the recent host-shift events are

61

hypothesised to drive the evolution of transmissibility and virulence in SARS-CoV-2 (Sironi

62

et al., 2020). Shortly after the first isolated SARS-CoV-2 genome from China was published,

63

>30,500 distinct mutations were catalogued in the CoV-GLUE (http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/)

64

among globally circulating strains of this virus (Singer et al., 2020). Variation in the genetic

65

makeup are key determinants in measuring the evolutionary distance and stability of SARS-

66

CoV-2 from the first sequenced isolate (Hu et al., 2020). Moreover, tracking the evolution of

67

SARS-CoV-2 since its introduction in humans is a high priority undertaking to prevent future

68

waves of this pandemic from escaping the global preparedness (van Dorp et al., 2020). Since

69

many vaccine candidates currently under development are derived from the first available

70

SARS-CoV-2 sequences, recurrent genetic changes may have an unforeseen impact on their

71

sustained effectiveness in longer term (Dearlove et al., 2020).

72

The availability of whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in public repositories such as

73

Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) and real-time data visualisation

74

pipeline NextStrain (https://nextstrain.org) offers a great opportunity for scientists to track the

75

evolutionary path of this virus. Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak

76

LINeages tool (PANGOLIN) has been the most widely used tool for lineage assignment to

77

newly emerging variants. PANGOLIN has also been deployed in establishing the

78

transmission patterns of various clones of this virus (Rambaut et al., 2020). Due to the fast-

79

evolving nature of this virus, the evolution and respective lineage assignment has not been

80

easy (Tang et al., 2020; Rambaut et al., 2020). As a result, multiple studies that tracked the

81

evolution of SARS-CoV-2, have been hugely controversial. For example, doubts have been

82

cast on the claim of finding more aggressive L type emerging from S type strains (Tang et al.,

83

2020). Similarly, the hypothesis of rapid spread of D614G variant of SARS-CoV-2 indicating

84

a possible fitness advantage has been questioned (Plante et al., 2020; Korber et al., 2020;

85

Hoffmann et al., 2020). Therefore, in the current and highly sensitive global circumstances

86

due to this pandemic, having a detailed map of mutations highlighting their prospective role

87

in therapeutics and vaccine development can prepare us better for the future waves of

88

continuously evolving SARS-Cov-2. In this study, we present a catalogue of the most

89

important genomic mutations recorded between December 2019 – November 2020 in SARS-

Methods

93

Data acquisition and curation

94

In

95

(https://www.gisaid.org/). Datasets that were flagged as complete (>28,000 bp) were screened

96

and subsequently manually curated for excluding low quality/coverage sequences and

97

duplicates. Sequence metadata (Supplementary Table S1) was retrieved and genome

98

containing sampling time and location were only chosen for the study. Lineages were

99

assigned from alignment file using the Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak

100

LINeages tool PANGOLIN v1.07 (https://github.com/hCoV-2019/pangolin). We selected a

101

subset of 513 genomes that belongs to all major PANGOLIN lineages and common

102

mutations for the optimal output of the phylogenetic tree.

103

Phylogenetic analysis

104

Genome sequences were aligned against the original Wuhan-Hu-1 genome (Accession:

105

NC_045512) using multiple genome sequence alignment tool MAFFT (v6.240).

106

Subsequently, the error prone 5’-UTR and 3’-UTR regions were masked and the genome size

107

was adjusted without losing key sites. Maximum likelihood tree was generated using

108

IQTREE v.1.6.1 (http://www.iqtree.org/) under the GTR nucleotide substitution model with

109

1000 bootstrap replicates. The ML tree was visualised and labelled using the interactive tree

110

of life software iTOL v.3 (Letunic & Bork, 2019).

111

Mutation Profiling

112

In order to identify the genetic variants, assembled genomes were mapped against the

113

reference (Wuhan-Hu-1: Accession: NC_045512) using Snippy mapping and variant calling

114

pipeline

115

(nonsynonymous) was extracted using custom written bash scripts and manually curated as

116

per CoV-GLUE database (http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/). Specifically, we considered 24

117

major missense mutations in four major structural proteins: Envelope protein (E), Membrane

118

glycoprotein (M), Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) and Spike protein (S). In addition,

Stability analysis

131

The stability of 62 missense mutations in four major proteins (E, M, N and S) was analysed

132

utilizing Site Directed Mutator (SDM) and DUET servers (Pandurangan et al., 2017; Pires et

133

al., 2014a). The impact of variations is predicted based on the difference in free energy

138

vector machines (SVM) based approach that combines two complementary approaches

139

(mCSM and SDM) and in a consensus prediction (Pires et al., 2014b). Structural stability of

in vibrational entropy energy (ΔΔSVib ENCoM) between wild-type and mutant protein was

calculated using DynaMut (Rodrigues et al., 2018).

Diversity of SARS-CoV-2 Genomes

145

Of the 7000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes screened, we constructed a robust phylogenetic tree on

146

strategically selected 513 genomes that reflected the most complete diversity among the

147

isolates by covering all the PANGOLIN lineages. Lineage assignment based on PANGOLIN

148

tool indicated the circulation of seven distinct lineages and/or sub-lineages such as A, B.1,

149

B.1.1, B.1.1.1, B.2, B.3, B.4 and B.6. This is in line with the phylogenetic groupings by

150

GISAID (S, L, V, O, G, GH and GR) (Figure 1). As the epidemic has progressed and

151

mutations have accumulated, further subdivision of major lineages into sub-lineages has been

152

observed. Overall, a total of 61 lineages and sub-lineages have been found to be circulating

153

concurrently in multiple countries around the world. In general, numerous introductions of

154

different variants were observed across the globe with a few sub-lineages (C.2, D.2) being

155

restricted to certain regions. While B.1.113 lineage, for example, has been exclusively

156

reported from India, lineages C.2 and D.2 geographically have been confined to South Africa

157

and Australia, respectively.

158

Major amino acid substitutions

159

Mutation mapping showed a total of 106 amino acid substitutions (missense mutations in >5

160

genomes) from a representative set of 513 genomes. The analysis also revealed 36 mutations

161

that were found in >5% of genome sequences while 12 major substitutions were lineage

162

defining mutations (Figure 1). The first major mutation to appear was L84S in ORF8,

163

(present in 8.6% of the genomes) that has defined A lineage (i.e. clade S in GISAID

164

classification). The subsequent amino acid substitutions L37F in ORF3a and G251V in nsp6

165

were found to be present in 13.3% and 1.4% of genomes, respectively. The combination of

166

G251V and L37F, which was initially considered as a defining mutation pattern for B.2 – B.6

167

lineage (clade V in GISAID classification), more detailed analysis has shown that isolates

168

carrying G251V mutation are distributed in other lineages too. The predominant lineage

169

defining mutations in the whole dataset were D614G (85.5%) and P323L (85.5%), after

170

originally appearing in late January 2020 (Figure 2). Other major mutations noted are Q57H

171

(26.5%), R203K/G204R (33%), G15S (12%), I120F (11.5%) and T85I (14%).

172

Dominance of D614G variant

173

Two mutations have become consensus: D614G in S (nucleotide 23,403, A to G) and P323L

174

(also known as P4715L) in nsp12 (nucleotide 14,143, C to T). These mutations were present

175

in 80.5% of the sequences and have defined the B.1 lineage (G in GISAID classification).

176

The widely discussed D614G variant is speculated to have been introduced in Europe at the

177

end of January (EPI_ISl_422424) before becoming globally dominant. Genomes with D614G

178

mutations were assigned as B.1 by PANGOLIN or GH/GR by GISAID. Notably, founder

179

lineage B.1 and its sub lineages B.1.X, B.1.1.X, D.X and C.X that carry both D614G and

180

P323L mutations have become the dominant variants across the world (87% of global

181

collection as per CoV-GLUE as on 30th November 2020).

182

As the pandemic has progressed several other major substitutions affecting the protein

183

structure have appeared. These are Q57H (nucleotide 25,563, G to T) in ORF3a, R203K +

184

G204R combination (nucleotide 28,881, GGG to AAC) in Nucleocapsid and T85I

185

(nucleotide 1059 C to T) in ORF1a. The region-specific sub lineages C.1, C.2, D.1 and D.2

186

were found to cumulatively harbour multiple mutations. Amino acid substitution such as

187

T428I and G15S in ORF1a were reported in sub lineages C.1 and C.2, and S477N

188

substitution in S protein along with I120F in nsp2, which specifically established the sub

189

lineage D.2 (Figure 1).

190

Balance of stabilizing and destabilizing mutations

191

The impact of mutations in key proteins is widely accepted as an important factor in driving

192

the clinically meaningful evolution, which potentially allows any pathogen to escape

193

available treatment and prevention regimes. Recent experimental evidence (Zhang et al.,

194

2020; Korber et al., 2020; Fernández et al.,2020) suggests that the emergence of D614G

195

variant led to stable phenotype with increased structural stability and enhanced infectivity.

196

Among the 24 major missense mutations, our analysis using SDM predicted 13 missense

197

mutations as stabilizing while using DUET analysis predicted 11. Among the conservatively

198

selected 14 missense mutations, 10 were predicted to be stabilizing by both SDM and DUET

199

server (Table 1).

200

Spike protein in full or part is the key vaccine candidate in today’s vaccine landscape. Of the

201

additional 38 amino acid substitutions that have been checked particularly for the stability of

202

spike protein, 13 were found to be stabilizing mutations while 16 were destabilizing the

203

protein structure. Nine mutations have given inconclusive results as SDM and DUET server

204

provided contrary

205

substitutions in spike protein were tested for stability of which 16 were stabilizing, 20 were

206

destabilizing and 12 showed inconclusive results. When checked for amino acid substitutions,

207

the stabilizing mutation in S protein predicted an increase in the rigidity of its structure

208

(Figure 3; Figure 4). The increased rigidities of the structure may provide a stable

209

conformation to the protein that may positively influence the binding of spike protein to

210

ACE2 receptor (Ou et al., 2020). Major mutations D614G and S477N were located at

ΔΔG values (Table 1). Overall, from both the datasets, 48 amino acid

7

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.22.423920; this version posted December 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

211

potential epitope regions (Codons 469–882) with S477N particularly positioned in the

212

receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein (319 – 541).

213

Most frequent amino acid substitutions were observed in the N protein, in which the variants

214

S194L, D103Y, P13L, S197L, M234I, and S188L were predicted to be stabilizing according

215

to both the analytical servers (Table 1). In contrast, M and E proteins accounted for the least

216

number of amino acid substitutions. The amino acid changes in M (T175M) indicated a

217

stabilizing effect, while E does not account for any stabilizing variant. Structural analysis of

218

double (D614G + S477N; D614G + A222V) and triple (D614G + S477N + A222V) mutation

219

patterns in S protein indicated ΔΔG values of 0.228, 0.195 and 0.129, respectively (Table 2).

220

This signifies that accumulation of spike mutation in D614G bearing lineages could

221

potentially be affecting the stability of the spike and therefore may influence the binding

222

affinity towards ACE2 receptor.

223

Discussion

224

Since the beginning of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, whole genome sequence based

225

phylogenetic inference has been heavily utilized in tracing viral origins and transmission

226

chains (Munnink et al., 2020). However, as the virus has evolved with time, genomic data is

227

being increasingly used in guiding infection risk and control strategies. Several genomic

228

mutations have been mapped that seem to be of advantage to the virus (Gómez-Carballa et

229

al., 2020). In parallel, numerous vaccine candidates have been designed using genomic data

230

from the original SARS-CoV-2 strain of Wuhan and many are now approved for use or at

231

late-stage trials (Dong et al., 2020; Alturki et al., 2020). Based on immunological data

232

obtained from infected and recovered patients, rightly, almost all COVID-19 vaccine

233

candidates of today are based on the original SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or its RBD domain

234

(Corbett et al., 2020; Sahin et al., 2020; Poland et al., 2020). However, as vaccines are

235

introduced and successful treatment options become available, it is vital that we carefully

236

monitor the mutations in the immunogenic region of SARS-CoV-2 genome (Li et al., 2020).

237

Mapping these changes on protein structure will allow pre-emptive forecasting of the

238

direction of change in vaccine effectiveness and guide future preparedness efforts. We

239

analysed the impact of recurrent amino acid replacements in the genomic evolution and

240

proteome stability of SARS-CoV-2 since its introduction in December 2019 to November

241

2020. Our analysis found an intriguing balance of stabilizing and destabilizing mutations,

242

allowing the SARS-CoV-2 to evolve and persist without losing pathogenicity.

243

SARS-CoV-2 is considered a slowly-evolving virus as it possesses an inherent proofreading

244

mechanism to repair the mismatches during its replication. This is believed to have a crucial

245

role in maintaining the stability and integrity of the viral genome (Robson et al., 2020; Bar-

246

On et al., 2020). Our analysis confirmed previously recorded positive natural selection of

247

D614G, S477N (Starr et al., 2020), S477N, A222V and V1176F (Farkas et al., 2020) variants

248

and a global expansion of the PANGOLIN variant B.1 (Rambaut et al., 2020). In addition, we

249

also observed a positive natural selection of Q57H (B.1.X), R203K/G204R (B.1.1.X), T85I

250

(B.1.2-B.1.3), G15S+T428I (C.X) and I120F (D.X) variants (Figure 2).

251

Apart from the clade defining mutations, some of the major missense mutations were in the

252

four structural proteins (E, M, N and S). When analysed for their impact in the respective

253

protein structure, spike glycoprotein, more specifically its RBD domain was found to be most

254

vulnerable to frequent mutations. This may be due to the immunological observation that

255

most neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been found to target the RBD domain of

256

the S protein (Ju et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). Consistent with this finding, a total of 4170

257

missense mutations have been reported in the spike protein, with 683 on the RBD domain

258

alone (CoV-Glue accessed on 12th December 2020). Computational prediction to understand

259

the effect of amino acid substitutions in E, M, N and S proteins revealed a balance of

260

stabilization and destabilization of the proteins. While viral population carrying mutations

261

with higher stabilizing effects (Positive

262

dominant variant, it is interesting to note that destabilization mutations in the major protein

263

targets of SARS-CoV-2 have also generated variants that have been hugely successful. For

264

example, many of the favourably selected variants such as L18F, L5F, R203K, G204R,

265

A220V (Nucleocapsid) were found to be destabilizing the respective protein structure (Table

266

1). As destabilizing mutations are known for their crucial functional roles, a trade-off

267

between stabilizing and destabilizing mutations may balance the protein function and

268

structure in ways that are not fully understood yet (Laha et al., 2020; Teng et al., 2020).

269

The currently circulating spike variants or RBD variants need to be taken into account while

270

evaluating the vaccine candidate or neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2

271

(Weisblum et al., 2020). Mapping the viral mutations that escape antibody binding is

272

essential for accessing the efficacy of therapeutic and prophylactic anti-SARSCoV-2 agents

273

(Starr et al., 2020a; Starr et al., 2020b). Recently generated experimental evidence suggests

274

that leading vaccines (mRNA-1273, BNT162b1 and ChAdOx1a) and two potent neutralizing

ΔΔG

275

antibodies (REGN10987 and REGN10933) are unlikely to be affected by the dominant

276

variant D614G (Corbett et al., 2020; Sahin et al., 2020; Voysey et al., 2020; Baum et al.,

277

2020; McAuley et al., 2020). As all three candidate vaccines encode RBD or the part of spike

278

protein as antigens, the viral population is expected to try and escape by altering the

279

positioning of the respective antigens (Greaney et al.,2020) when vaccination induced

280

selection pressure would be on. Notably, complete escape mutation map of 3,804 of the 3,819

281

possible RBD amino acid mutations against ten human monoclonal antibodies are already in

282

place (Starr et al., 2020a; Greaney et al.,2020). The antigenic effect of key RBD mutations

283

against REGN-COV2 cocktail (REGN10933 and REGN10987) showed N439K and K444R

284

variants escaped neutralization only by REGN10987, while E406W escaped both individual

285

REGN-COV2 antibodies and the cocktail (Starr et al., 2020b). Similar strategies should be

286

adopted to map all antibody resistance mutations against neutralizing antibodies elicited after

287

vaccination. Once mutation escape maps are available for all successful vaccine candidates,

288

vaccine roll out strategies should be carefully planned to dodge geographically confined

289

escape mutants.

290

Our study highlights the importance of continued genomic surveillance, mutation mapping,

291

stability analysis and potential escape mutation cataloguing in the pre- and post-vaccination

292

period of SARS-CoV-2 in designing epidemiologically best vaccination programs.

293

Conclusion

294

The currently observed mutation pattern and subsequent phylogenetic diversification of

295

SARS-CoV-2 seem to be strongly influenced by the negative and positive selection pressures.

296

The overall variation in SARS-CoV-2 sequences is currently low compared to many other

297

RNA viruses. One of the possible reasons for the slow rate of mutations can be attributed to

298

the widespread absence of neutralizing antibodies or the selective pressure. Once the virus

299

population is challenged with the vaccine candidates or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies

300

the currently known epitopes on surfaces of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are likely to undergo

301

rapid forced change for survival. Thus, the prevalence of such possible escape mutations

302

needs to be monitored even more carefully after vaccination if we are to remain ahead of this

303

pandemic curve.
