Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). To identify factors of the respiratory tract that suppress SARS-CoV-2, we screened a
peptide/protein library derived from bronchoalveolar lavage, and identified α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT) as
specific inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2. α1-AT targets the viral spike protein and blocks SARS-CoV-2
infection of human airway epithelium at physiological concentrations. Our findings show that
endogenous α1-AT restricts SARS-CoV-2 and repurposes α1-AT-based drugs for COVID-19 therapy.
Main
SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through inhalation of contaminated droplets and aerosols and
consequently infects cells of the respiratory tract. In most cases, infection is limited to the upper airways
resulting in no or only mild symptoms. Severe disease is caused by viral dissemination to the lungs
ultimately resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome, cytokine storm, multi-organ failure, septic
shock, and death. The airway epithelium acts as a frontline defense against respiratory pathogens, not
only as a physical barrier and through the mucociliary apparatus but also via its immunological
functions1. The epithelial lining fluid is rich in innate immunity peptides and proteins with antibacterial
and antiviral activity, such as lysozyme, lactoferrin or defensins2. Currently, our knowledge about innate
immune defense mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract is very limited.
To identify endogenous antiviral peptides and proteins, we previously generated peptide/protein
libraries from body fluids and tissues and screened the resulting fractions for antiviral factors3. This
approach allowed to identify novel modulators of HIV-14,5, CMV6 and HSV-27 infection, with prospects

for clinical development as antiviral drugs8. Here, we set out to identify factors of the respiratory tract
that inhibit SARS-CoV-2. For this, we extracted polypeptides from 6.5 kg of homogenized human lung
or 20 liters of pooled bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and separated them by chromatographic means.
The corresponding fractions were added to Caco2 cells and infected with pseudoparticles carrying the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein9. None of the fractions of the lung library suppressed infection (Extended
Data Fig. 1a). In contrast, fractions 42-45 of the BAL library prevented SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticle
infection almost entirely (Fig. 1a). The antiviral effect was comparable to that of 10 µM EK1, a spikespecific peptide fusion inhibitor used as control10 (Fig. 1a). Titration of BAL fractions 42 to 45 onto
Caco2 cells confirmed that they prevent infection by SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudoparticles in a dosedependent manner (Extended Data Fig. 2).
To isolate the antiviral factor, the corresponding mother fraction 42 was further separated
chromatographically and the resulting sub-fractions analyzed for antiviral activity. As shown in Fig. 1b,
sub-fractions 42_4 to 42_9 and 42_57 reduced, and sub-fraction 42_55 almost completely prevented
SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudoparticle infection. Analysis of these inhibitory fractions by gel
electrophoresis showed distinct protein bands in sub-fractions 42_55 and 42_57, whereas no
peptide/protein was detectable in sub-fractions 42_5 to 42_7 (Extended Data Fig. 3). The most active
sub-fraction 42_55 contained a prominent band at ~ 52 kDa, which was also detectable in other active
fractions but hardly present in those showing no antiviral activity (e.g. 42_49) (Extended Data Fig. 3).
This band was excised from the gel and subjected to MALDI-TOF-MS revealing a 100 % sequence
identity to α1-antitrypsin (SERPINA1) (Extended Data Fig. 4 and extended Table 1), a 52 kDa protease
inhibitor11. The presence of α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT) in inhibitory fractions 42_55 and 42_57 was
confirmed by Western Blots with an α1-AT-specific antibody (Extended Data Fig. 5).

the spike priming protease TMPRSS2 was included as control9,12. α1-AT and CM both suppressed
SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudoparticle infection of Caco2 cells, with half-maximal inhibitory
concentrations (IC50) of ~ 2 mg/ml for α1-AT, and ~ 0.05 µM for CM, respectively (Fig. 1c). Cell
viability assays showed that α1-AT displays no cytotoxic effects at concentrations of up to 8.2 mg/ml,
whereas CM reduced cell viability at concentrations of 200 µM, due to DMSO in the stock (Extended
Data Fig. 6). The antiviral activity of α1-AT and CM was specific for the corona virus spike because
infection of pseudoparticles carrying the G-protein of VSV was not affected (Fig. 1c). These data
suggest that α1-AT may inhibit an early step in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. In fact, time of
addition experiments showed that α1-AT blocks infection if added to cells 1 to 4 hours prior to or
during SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection (Fig. 1d) , but not if added 2 hours post infection (Extended
Data Fig. 7).
To determine whether α1-AT inhibits not only Spike-containing pseudoparticles but also wild-type
SARS-CoV-2, we examined its activity against two SARS-CoV-2 isolates from France and the
Netherlands. For this, we assessed survival rates of Vero cells infected in the absence or presence of
EK1, CM or α1-AT. In the absence of drugs, infection by both SARS-CoV-2 isolates resulted in a
massive virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) and reduced cell viability by about 80% (Extended Data
Fig. 8). Microscopic evaluation revealed the absence of CPE in the presence of high concentrations of
the compounds (not shown). MTS assays confirmed a concentration-dependent inhibition of cell killing
and viral replication by EK1 and CM (Extended Data Fig. 8, Fig. 1e) with average IC 50 values against
both SARS-CoV-2 isolates of 2.81 ± 2.52 µM for EK1, and 3.62 ± 0.03 µM for CM, respectively (Fig.
1e). Strikingly, α1-AT suppressed the French SARS-CoV-2 isolate with an IC50 of 0.58 mg/ml, and the
Dutch strain with an IC50 of 0.81 mg/ml (Fig. 1e). Almost complete rescue of cell viability was observed
at α1-AT concentration of 2-4 mg/ml (Extended Data Fig. 8, Fig. 1e).

Fig. 2. α1-AT inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of human airway epithelium cultures. The apical site of HAEC
was exposed to buffer (mock), α1-AT (500 µg/ml) and remdesivir (5 µM) and then inoculated with SARS-CoV2. Tissues were fixed 2 days later, stained with DAPI (cell nuclei), a SARS-CoV-2 specific spike antibody and an
α-tubulin-specific antibody. Images represent maximum projections of serial sections along the basolateral to
apical cell axis. Scale bar: 50 μm.

To corroborate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of α1-AT under conditions reflecting the in vivo
conditions, fully differentiated human airway epithelial cells (HAEC) grown at air-liquid conditions
were treated with 0.5 mg/ml of α1-AT and then infected with SARS-CoV-2. As control we used 5 µM
of remdesivir, which has previously been shown to suppress coronavirus replication in HAECs 13. At
day 2, cells were fixed and stained with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike14, and α-tubulin as
marker for ciliated cells at the apical surface15. In infected mock-treated HAECs, SARS-CoV-2 spike
expression was readily detectable, mostly in neighboring ciliated cells (Fig. 2), demonstrating that the
epithelia were productively infected. Spike expression levels in α1-AT and remdesivir treated cultures
were greatly reduced (Fig. 2). Thus, α1-AT suppresses SARS-CoV-2 infection of HAEC culture.
Our results demonstrate that endogenous lung- and plasma-derived α1-AT inhibit SARS-CoV-2
infection in cell lines and fully differentiated airway epithelium cultures. A recent preprint publication
suggests that α1-AT may suppress the spike protein priming protease TMPRSS2, similar to Camostat
mesylate16, however, evidence that α1-AT indeed inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection was lacking. Our
results using pseudoparticles and replication-competent virus are in line with this observation, because
α1-AT prevents an early step in the viral life cycle, and selectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 spike but not
VSV-G mediated infection, which is independent from TMPRSS2 activation17. Thus, similar to
Camostate mesylate, α1-AT may inhibit TMPRSS2-mediated priming of the Spike protein, thereby
preventing engagement of the ACE2 receptor and subsequent fusion.
α1-AT has a reference range in blood of 0.9–2.3 mg/mL, and levels further increase 4-fold during acute
inflammation. We show that plasma-derived α1-AT blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection with IC50 values
ranging from ~ 0.5 to 1 mg/mL and almost completely inhibit virus infection at of 2-4 mg/mL. These
concentrations are well within the range in blood and interstitial fluid18. Thus, α1-AT may serve as
natural inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in particular during acute infection when α1-AT
concentrations increase. Thus, it will be interesting to further investigate whether the levels of α1-AT
in the lungs or blood of COVID-19 patients inversely correlate with viral loads or disease progression.
Most importantly, α1-AT is an approved drug allowing its repositioning for the therapy of COVID-19.
α1-AT deficiency is a hereditary disorder which results in reduced concentrations of the serpin and
consequently a chronic uninhibited breakdown of tissue in the lungs. Several products containing α1AT concentrated from human plasma (such as Prolastin® used herein) are approved since decades for
intravenous augmentation therapy in patients suffering from α1-AT deficiency. Of note, α1-AT can also
be administered at substantially higher doses than those in routine α1-AT deficiency (60 mg/kg/wk).
Studies have administered α1-AT at 250 mg/kg without causing side effects and resulting in a 5-fold
increase of the serpin concentrations in lung epithelial lining fluid19. Thus, rapid evaluation of α1-AT
as drug in severe COVID-19 disease is highly warranted.

Generation of a peptide/protein library from lungs:
6.5 kg of human lung were obtained from dead individuals without known diseases from pathology of
Ulm University. The organs were frozen at -20°C and afterwards freeze dried. In the next step the lung
material was homogenized and peptides and small proteins extracted by an ice-cold acetic acid
extraction procedure. Then the mixture was centrifuged at 4.200 rpm, and the supernatant filtrated
through a 0.45 μm filter. Thereafter, the obtained peptides and proteins were separated by ultrafiltration
(cutoff:30kDa). The filtrate was then separated by reversed-phase (RP) chromatography with a Sepax
Poly RP300 50x300mm (Sepax Technologies, Newark DE, USA 260300-30025) with a flow rate of
100 ml/min with the gradient program (min/%B): 0/5 5/5 20/25 35/50 50/100 being A, 0.1% TFA
(Merck, 1082621000) in ultrapure water, and B, 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile (J.T.Baker, JT9012-3).
Reversed-phase chromatographic fractions of 50 ml were collected to constitute the lung peptide bank,
from which 1 mL-aliquots (2 %) were lyophilized and used for antiviral activity testing.
Generation of a peptide/protein library from BAL
Clinical samples of BAL comprising a total of 20 L were collected and immediately frozen for further
processing. Peptide/protein extraction was done by acidification with acetic acid to pH 3, followed by
centrifugation at 4.200 rpm and filtration (0.45 μm) of the supernatant. Further, the filtered BAL was
subjected to ultrafiltration (cut off: 30 kDa) yielding 22 L of a sample enriched in peptides and proteins.
Chromatographic fractionation of the ultrafiltrated sample was performed by using a reversed-phase
(PS/DVB) HPLC column Sepax Poly RP300 (Sepax Technologies, Newark DE, USA 260300-30025)
of dimensions 3 x 25 cm, 121 at a flow rate of 55 mL/min with the gradient program (min/%B): 0/5 5/5
20/25 35/50 50/75 55/0, being A, 0.1% TFA (Merck, 1082621000) in ultrapure water, and B, 0.1% TFA
in acetonitrile (J.T.Baker, JT9012-3). Seventy-three reversed-phase chromatographic fractions of 50 ml
were collected to constitute the BAL peptide bank, from which 1 mL-aliquots (2 %) were lyophilized
and used for antiviral activity testing. For further purification of active fractions, a second reversedphase C18 HPLC 4,6x250mm column (Phenomenex 00G-4605-EO) at a flow rate of 0,8mL/min with
gradient program (min/%B):0/5 50/60 60/100 was used.
Cell culture
Unless stated otherwise, HEK293T cells were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal calf
serum (FCS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Caco2 cells were
cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal calve serum (FCS), 2 mM Glutamine, 100 U/ml
Penicillin and 100 mg/µl Streptomycin, 1x non-essential amino acids (NEAA) and 1 mM sodium
pyruvate. TMPRSS2-expressing Vero E6 cells (kindly provided by the National Institute for Biological
Standards and Control (NIBSC), #100978) were cultivated in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal
calf serum (FCS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 1 mg/ml
geneticin.
Generation of lentiviral pseudotypes:
For generation of lentiviral SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticles (LV(Luc)-CoV-2-S) 900,000 HEK293T cells
were seeded in 2 ml HEK293T medium. The next day, medium was replaced and cells were transfected
with a total of 1 µg DNA using polyethylenimin (PEI). 2 % of pCG1-SARS-2-S (encoding the spike
protein of SARS-CoV2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, NCBI reference Sequence YP_009724390.1, kindly
provided by Stefan Pöhlmann) were mixed with pCMVdR8_91 (encoding a replication deficient
lentivirus) and pSEW-Luc2 (encoding a luciferase reporter gene, both kindly provided by Christian
Buchholz) in a 1:1 ratio in OptiMEM. Plasmid DNA was mixed with PEI at a DNA:PEI ratio of 1:3
(3 μg PEI per μg DNA), incubated for 20 min at RT and added to cells dropwise. At 8 h post
transfection, medium was removed, cells were washed with 2 ml of PBS and 2 ml of HEK293T medium
with 2.5 % FCS were added. At 48 h post transfection, pseudoparticles containing supernatants were
harvested and clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 1500 rpm.

Generation of VSV-based pseudotypes:
For generation of a VSV-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticle (VSV(Luc_eGFP)-CoV-2-S), HEK293T
were seeded in 30 ml HEK293T medium in a T175 cell culture flask. The next day, cells were
transfected with a total 44 µg pCG1-SARS-2-S (encoding the pike protein of SARS-CoV2 isolate
Wuhan-Hu-1, NCBI reference Sequence YP_009724390.1, kindly provided by Stefan Pöhlmann) using
PEI. Plasmid DNA and PEI were mixed in 4.5 ml of OptiMEM at a 2:1 ratio (2 μg PEI per μg DNA),
incubated for 20 min at RT and added to cells dropwise. 24 h post transfection, medium was replaced
and cell were transduced with VSV-G-protein pseudotyped VSV encoding luciferase and GFP reporter
gene (kindly provided by Gert Zimmer, Institute of Virology and Immunology,
Mittelhäusern/Switzerland)20. At 2 h post transduction, cells were washed three times with PBS and
cultivated for 16 h in HEPES-buffered HEK293T medium. Virus containing supernatants were then
harvested and clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 1500 rpm, residual pseudoparticles harboring
VSV-G-protein were blocked by addition of anti-VSV-G hybridoma supernatant at 1/10 volume ratio
(I1, mouse hybridoma supernatant from CRL-2700; ATCC). Virus stocks were concentrated 10-fold
using a 100 kDa Amicon molecular weight cutoff and stored at -80°C until use.
Screening lung and BAL library for inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection:
10,000 Caco2 cells (colorectal carcinoma cells) were seeded in 100 µl respective medium in a 96-well
flat bottom plate. The next day, medium was replaced by 40 µl of serum-free medium. For screening
peptide containing fractions, 10 µl of the solubilized fraction were added to cells. Cells were inoculated
with 50 µl of infectivity normalized LV(Luc)-CoV2 (or LV(Luc)-no GP control). Transduction rates
were assessed by measuring luciferase activity in cell lysates at 48 hours post transduction with a
commercially available kit (Promega). Values for untreated controls were set to 100% infection.
Gel electrophoresis and western blotting:
Gel electrophoresis of active fractions was performed on a 4-12 % Bis-Tris protein gel (NuPAGE™)
according to the manufacturers protocol. Prior to electrophoresis, samples were reduced by addition of
50 mM TCEP and heated for 10 min at 70 °C. Protein gel was either stained with Coomassie G-250
(GelCode™ Blue Stain) or applied to western blotting of α1-AT with a polyclonal anti-α1-AT antibody
(Proteintech 16382-1-AP). The primary antibody was detected with labeled anti-rabbit secondary
antibody and imaged with Odysey Infrared Imager (Licor).
Tryptic in-gel digestion of proteins
Bands of interest were excised and the proteins were digested with trypsin. Tryptic peptides were eluted
from the gel slices with 1% trifluoric acid.
Matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS)
MALDI-TOF-MS was performed on an Ultraflex TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics,
Bremen) equipped with a nitrogen laser and a LIFT-MS/MS facility. The instrument was operated in
the positive-ion reflectron mode using 2.5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and methylendiphosphonic acid as
matrix. Sum spectra consisting of 200–400 single spectra were acquired. For data processing and
instrument control the Compass 1.4 software package consisting of FlexControl 4.4, FlexAnalysis 3.4
4, Sequence Editor and BioTools 3.2 and ProteinScape 3.1. were used. External calibration was
performed with a peptide standard (Bruker Daltonics).
Database search
Proteins were identified by MASCOT peptide mass fingerprint search (http://www.matrixscience.com)
using the Uniprot Human database (version 20200226, 210438 sequence entries; p<0.05). For the

search, a mass tolerance of 75 ppm was allowed and oxidation of methionine as variable modification
was used.
Time-of addition experiments
One day prior to transduction, 10,000 Caco2 cells were seeded with respective medium in a 96 well
plate. For the addition of α1-AT prior to infection, medium was replaced by 80 µl of serum-free medium
and cells were incubated with serial dilutions of α1-AT for 0, 1, 2 and 4 h at 37 °C followed by infection
with 20 µl of infectivity normalized VSV(Luc)-CoV-2-S pseudoparticles. To investigate whether α1AT acts post viral entry, medium was replaced by 100 µl of serum-free medium. Cells were inoculated
with 20 µl of infectivity normalized VSV(Luc)-CoV-2 pseudoparticles and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C.
After incubation period cells were washed with 100 µl PBS and 100 µl serum-free medium as well as
20 µl of serially diluted α1-AT were added. Infection rates were assessed by measuring luciferase
activity in cell lysates at 16 h post transduction with a commercially available kit (Promega). Values
for untreated controls were set to 100% infection.
Cell viability assay
To assess cytotoxicity of α1-AT and camostat mesylate, 10,000 Caco2 cells were seeded in 100 µl
medium in a 96-well flat bottom plate. The next day, medium was replaced by 80 µl of serum-free
Caco2 medium and cells were treated with serial dilutions of Prolastin®, camostat mesylate or DMSO
as solvent control for camostat mesylate. After 48 h, cell viability was assessed by measruring ATP
levels in cells lysates with a commercially available kit (CellTiter-Glo®, Promega).
MTS cell viability assay
To quantify SARS-CoV-2 wildtype infection, virus induced cell death was inferred from remaining cell
viability determined by MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) assay. To this end, 20,000 TMPRSS2-expressing Vero E6 cells were
seeded in 96 well plates in 100 µl respective medium. The next day, medium was replaced with 132 µl
serum-free medium and the respective compound of interest was added. After incubation for 1 h at 37°C
the cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 0.001 (MOI; based on PFU per cell) of the
viral isolates BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020 (#014V-03890) and BetaCoV/Netherlands/01/NL/2020
(#010V-03903), which were obtained through the European Virus Archive global, in a total volume of
180 µl. 2 days later, infection was quantified by detecting remaining metabolic activity. To this end, 36
µl of CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Reagent (Promega G3580) was added to the medium and
incubated for 3 h at 37°C. Then, optical density (OD) was recorded at 620 nm using a Asys Expert 96
UV microplate reader (Biochrom). To determine infection rates, sample values were subtracted from
untreated control and untreated control set to 100%.
Generation of human airway epithelial cells
Differentiated ALI cultures of human airway epithelial cells (HAECs) were generated from primary
human basal cells isolated from airway epithelia. Cells were expanded in a T75 flask (Sarstedt) in
Airway Epithelial Cell Basal Medium supplemented with Airway Epithelial Cell Growth Medium
SupplementPack (both Promocell). Growth medium was replaced every two days. Upon reaching 90 %
confluence, HAECs were detached using DetachKIT (Promocell) and seeded into 6.5 mm Transwell
filters (Corning Costar). Filters were precoated with Collagen Solution (StemCell Technologies)
overnight and irradiated with UV light for 30 min before cell seeding for collagen crosslinking and
sterilization. 3.5 x 104 cells in 200 µl growth medium were added to the apical side of each filter, and
an additional 600 µl of growth medium was added basolaterally. The apical medium was replaced after
48 h. After 72 – 96 h, when cells reached confluence, the apical medium was removed and basolateral
medium was switched to differentiation medium ± 10 ng/ml IL-13 (IL012; Merck Millipore).
Differentiation medium consisted of a 50:50 mixture of DMEM-H and LHC Basal (Thermo Fisher)

supplemented with Airway Epithelial Cell Growth Medium SupplementPack and was replaced every 2
days. Air-lifting (removal of apical medium) defined day 0 of air-liquid interface (ALI) culture, and
cells were grown at ALI conditions until experiments were performed at day 25 to 28. To avoid mucus
accumulation on the apical side, HAEC cultures were washed apically with PBS for 30 min every three
days from day 14 onwards.
Effect of remdesivir and α1-antitrypsin on SARS-CoV-2 infection of HAECs
Immediately before infection, the apical surface of HAECs grown on Transwell filters were washed
three times with 200 µl PBS to remove accumulated mucus. Then, 5 µM remdesivir were added into
the basal medium or 500 µg/ml α1-AT were added into the basal medium and onto the apical surface.
Cells were infected with 9.25 × 102 plaque forming units (PFU) of SARS-CoV-2
(BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020). After incubation for 2 h at 37°C, viral inoculum was removed and
cells were washed three times with 200 µl PBS. At 2 days post infection, cells were fixed for 30 min in
4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized for 10 min with 0.2% saponin and 10% FCS in PBS,
washed twice with PBS and stained with anti-SARS-CoV-2 (1A9; Biozol GTX-GTX632604) antiMUC5AC (clone 45M1; MA1-21907, Thermo Scientific) and anti-alpha-tubulin (MA1-8007, Thermo
Scientific diluted 1:300 to 1:500, respectively, in PBS, 0.2% saponin and 10% FBS over night at 4 °C.
Subsequently cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in PBS,
0.2% saponin and 10% FCS containing AlexaFluor 488-labelled anti-rabbit, AlexaFluor 468-labelled
anti-mouse and AlexaFluor 647-labelled anti-rat secondary antibody, respectively (all 1:500; Thermo
Scientific) and DAPI + phalloidin AF 405 (1: 5,000; Thermo Scientific). Images were taken on an
inverted confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP5) using a 40x lens (Leica HC PL APO CS2 40x1.25 OIL).
Images for the blue (DAPI), green (AlexaFluor 488), red (AlexaFluor 568) and far-red (AlexaFluor
647) channels were taken in sequential mode using appropriate excitation and emission settings.
Non-linear regression and statistics:
Analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.4.2. Calculation of IC50 values via non-linear
regression was performed using normalized response-variable slope equation. For statistical analysis, a
2-way ANOVA with Dunett´s multiple comparison test was used.
Data availability
All primary data will be made accessible to qualified researchers upon request.

Additional information

Extended data Fig. 1. Screening a peptide/protein library made from lungs for fractions with activity
against SARS-CoV-2. The 39 fractions were added to Caco2 cells and infected with SARS-CoV-2 Spike
pseudoparticles. Infection was determined two days later by luciferase assay. The spike specific peptide entry
blocker EK1 was used as control. Data shown were derived from duplicate (screen) and triplicate infections (EK1).

Extended data Fig. 2. BAL fractions 42-45 inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype infection. Serial dilutions of the
BAL fractions 42 to 45 and EK1 (see Fig. 1a) were added to Caco2 cells, which were subsequently infected with
SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudoparticles. Infection rates were determined two days later by luciferase assay. Data
shown were derived from and triplicate infections.

Extended data Fig. 3. Gel electrophoresis of BAL fractions. Gel electrophoresis of active fractions was
performed on a 4-12 % Bis-Tris protein gel. Prior to electrophoresis, samples were reduced by addition of 50
mM TCEP and heated for 10 min at 70 °C. Protein gel was stained with Coomassie G-250. The boxed band
fraction 42/55 was cut out and subjected in to an in gel tryptic digest.

Extended data Fig. 7. α1-AT has no effect on SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudoparticle infection if added post
entry. Caco2 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudoparticles. After 2 hours, inoculum was removed
and α1-AT was added. Infection rates were determined 2 dpi by measuring luciferase activities in cellular lysates.
Values shown were derived from triplicate infections and show mean values ± sd.

Extended data Fig. 8. α1-AT inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection. TMPRSS2-expressing Vero cells were exposed
to indicated concentrations of EK1, CM and α1-AT and then infected with a French (#1) and Dutch (#2) SARSCoV-2 isolate. 2 days later, virus induced cytopathic effects were determines by XTS assay. a) Optical density
(OD) was recorded at 620 nm using a Asys Expert 96 UV microplate reader (Biochrom). b) To determine infection
rates, sample values were subtracted from untreated control and untreated control set to 100%. Values shown were
derived from triplicate infections and show mean values ± sd.
