ABSTRACT
Background: Viral and host immune kinetics during acute COVID-19 and after
remission of acute symptoms need better characterization.
Methods: SARS-CoV-2 RNA, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA, IgM, and IgG antibodies, and proinflammatory cytokines were measured in sequential samples among hospitalized
COVID-19 patients during acute infection and 6 months following diagnosis.
Results: 24 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients with mild/moderate and severe
COVID-19 were included. Most were males 83%, median age of 61 years. 21% were
admitted to the ICU and 8 of them (33.3%) met criteria for severe COVID-19 disease. A
delay in SARS-CoV-2 levels decline during the first 6 days of follow-up and viral load
persistence until month 3 were related with severe COVID-19, but not viral load levels at
the diagnosis. Higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA, IgM, IgG and the cytokines IL-6,
IL-8 and MIP-1β at the diagnosis time were related with severe COVID-19 outcome.
Higher levels of MIP-1β, IL-1β, MIP-1𝛼 and IFN-𝛾 were observed at month 1/3 during
mild/moderate disease compared to severe COVID-19. IgG persisted at low levels after
6 months of diagnosis.
Conclusions: Higher concentrations of IgA, IgM, and IgG, and IL-6, IL-8 and MIP-1β are
identified as early predictors of COVID-19 severity, but not SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels at
diagnosis.
Key Words: SARS-CoV-2, severe COVID-19, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, cytokines,

INTRODUCTION
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), rapidly spread worldwide becoming a global
public health emergency. COVID-19 can be asymptomatic or mild in most cases, but it
can rapidly progress to a severe lung inflammation leading to Acute Respiratory Distress
Syndrome (ARDS), especially for older adults (> 80 years) and/or with comorbidities (i.e.,
serious heart conditions, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, or hypertension
among others) [1–3]. The disease outcome mainly depends on the characteristics of the
viral replication and host immune responses, which can end up resolving the infection
efficiently or creating an exacerbated inflammation associated with severe lung damage
pathology, organ failure and poor outcomes [4,5].
The comprehensive long-term kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels, anti-SARSCoV-2 antibodies (i.e., IgA, IgM, and IgG) and specific pro-inflammatory cytokines during
and after COVID-19 is not fully characterized, and it is of great interest for the
identification of early predictive biomarkers of severe disease and to understand the
clinical outcomes of patients after the remission of acute symptoms.
This study comprises an evaluation of clinical, virological and immunological
responses in a well-characterized cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with
mild/moderate and severe disease. We performed a close follow-up at different time
points from the time of diagnosis and up to 6 months after the confirmation of the SARSCoV-2 infection. Moreover, we were able to identify viral and host-immune biomarkers
associated with COVID-19 severity. A delay in the SARS-CoV-2-RNA clearance in the
upper respiratory tract during the first days of the disease, higher concentrations of antiSARS-CoV-2 IgA, IgM, and IgG, and of specific cytokines (i.e., IL-6, IL-8 and MIP-1β) at
baseline were associated with COVID-19 severity. Overall, after 6 months, anti-SARSCoV-2 IgG persisted although at low levels.

METHODS
Patients, sample collection and clinical data
The study population was selected from the COVID-19 Cohort of the Galicia Sur
Health Research Institute (COHVID-GS) (https://www.iisgaliciasur.es/apoyo -a-lainvestigacion/cohorte-covid19/). This cohort includes laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV2 patients in clinical follow-up at the Vigo Healthcare Area with epidemiological/clinical
data and with a repository of biological samples (i.e., nasopharyngeal swabs, serum,
plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells-PBMCs) stored at the Galicia Sur Health
Research Institute Biobank. The epidemiological/clinical information was collected in a
Case Report Form (CRF) specifically predesigned for the COHVID-GS. The cohort also
includes a control group of uninfected individuals (anti-IgA, IgM and IgG SARS-CoV-2
negative). Written informed consent was obtained from each individual enrolled in the
COHVID-GS. All the techniques were performed in BLS-2 conditions, according to the
biosafety guidelines for handling and processing specimens associated with COVID-19
(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/lab-biosafety-guidelines.html).
The selection criteria for this study were SARS-CoV-2 adult hospitalized patients
with a very close clinical follow-up with nasopharyngeal swabs, serum and plasma
samples, with consecutive samples available at least at baseline; and day 3 or 6; and
month 1 or 3 from their inclusion in the COHVID-GS. Moreover, only those patients
included in the COHVID-GS between day 1 and 5 following the confirmation of the
SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-qPCR were considered. Serial paired nasopharyngeal
swabs, serum and plasma samples were collected from each patient at baseline, day 3
or 6, month 1 or 3 and at month 6. We also included 30 serum samples from healthy and
non-infected individuals as controls for the immunoassay experiments. Epidemiological
and clinical data were recorded for the study population.

Following WHO guidance, severe COVID-19 was defined as the need for invasive
mechanical ventilation, the development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
(PO2/FiO2 < 300 mmHg or Saturation O2/FiO2 < 330) or the admission to an Intensive
Care Unit (ICU) [6]. Patients who did not meet severe criteria were considered as
mild/moderate COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA extraction
Viral RNA was extracted from 140 µL of nasopharyngeal swab samples using the
QIAmp viral RNA mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and the automatized QIAcube
system (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), and was eluted in 50 µL of buffer following the
manufacturer’s instructions. The positive (SARS-CoV-2 Standard, EDx Exact
Diagnostics) and negative (SARS-CoV-2 Negative, EDx Exact Diagnostics) controls
were also extracted using the same procedure.

Droplet digital PCR analysis
SARS-CoV-2 viral load was quantified by reverse transcriptase droplet digital
PCR (RT-ddPCR), including the one-step reverse transcription (One-Step RT-ddPCR
Advanced Kit for Probes, Bio-Rad Laboratories) and the triplex probe assay for PCR
amplification (2019-nCoV CDC ddPCR Triplex Probe Assay, Bio-Rad Laboratories). The
assay contains primers and probes targeting two regions of the SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid gene (N1 and N2) and the human RNase P gene (RPP30). The reaction
mixture was performed with 5.5 µL of SARS-CoV-2 RNA sample and following the
manufacturer’s instructions. All the samples were tested in duplicate. Data analysis was
performed using the QuantaSoft Analysis Pro Software (Bio-Rad Laboratories) which
showed the results as copies per microliter of 1x ddPCR reaction. All viral load values
were recalculated to copies per millilitre of swab, and the sensitivity threshold was 100
copies/mL. To assess the accuracy of the absolute viral RNA quantification, two-fold
serial dilutions of the positive control were analysed for lineal regression analysis. Finally,

to establish a reliable comparison between the viral load of different samples, the
absolute quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was normalized with RPP30 and expressed
as copies/104 cells (supplementary material section).

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA, IgG, and IgM quantification
The wells of 96-well immunoassay plates were coated overnight at 4ºC with 50
μL of 5 μg/mL of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) in 50 mM carbonate buffer pH 9.4.
The wells were washed three times with 200 μL of PBS containing 0.05 % (v/v) Tween20 (PBST) and then blocked with 200 μL of 5 % (w/v) skim milk in PBST for 30 min. After
another washing step, 50 μL of serum samples (diluted 1/100 with PBS after heating for
30 min at 56ºC to inactivate residual virus) were added to the wells and incubated for 1
h. The wells were washed again three times with PBST and 50 μL of anti-human IgAHRP, anti-human IgM-HRP or anti-human IgG-HRP enzyme conjugates diluted 1/20000
with PBST were added. After a final incubation for 30 min, the wells were washed five
times with PBST and 50 μL of TMB Super Sensitive ELISA substrate were added in each
well. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μL of 1 M H2SO4 after 5 min for IgM
and IgA detection or 7 min for IgG detection. The absorbance at 450 nm was finally read
on a SPECTRAmax 340PC-384 microplate reader. The levels of IgA, IgM and IgG
antibodies in each sample were estimated using standard antibody calibration curves
performed in parallel in each plate as detailed in the supplementary information. Prepandemic serum samples were used as controls to set the background levels of the inhouse developed ELISA. All incubation steps were performed at room temperature (2225ºC) unless stated otherwise.

Plasma cytokines quantification
Plasma cytokines concentrations were determined using enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), interleukin 1 beta (IL1β), Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), Macrophage

Inflammatory Proteins 1 alpha (MIP-1α) and 1 beta (MIP-1β) were analysed using a
multiplex bead-based immunoassay (MILLIPLEX® MAP Human High Sensitivity T Cell
Magnetic Bead Panel). Interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), (Human CXCL10
ELISA kit, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and soluble receptor interleukin 2 (sCD25) were
analysed using the Human Quantikine Immunoassay (R&D Systems). All following the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Statistics
The descriptive analyses were reported as frequencies and percentages for
categorical variables and medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) for continuous
variables. To compare antibody levels between COVID-19 patients and a peer control
group, and to compare SARS-CoV-2 viral load and cytokines between severe and
mild/moderate patients, Mann-Whitney U test was performed. To assess the differences
in the viral load overtime and the concentration of the cytokines in several time points
during the first 6 months after SARS-COV-2 infection, a Wilcoxon Signed Rank test was
performed. Finally, Mann-Whitney U test was also used to compare the baseline
antibodies levels and baseline cytokines concentration with the severe clinical outcomes
(ICU admission, requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation and development of
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). Statistical analyses were done with SPSS
version 19 and GraphPad Prism 8.2.1 and a p value less than 0.05 was considered
statistical significance.

RESULTS
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the studied patients
A total of 24 hospitalized laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were included
in the study. The demographic and most relevant clinical characteristics related with
COVID-19 are shown in Table 1. Most 83% (20/24) were males with a median age of 61
years old (IQR: 48-75.3). Nearly 50% (12/24) of patients met obese criteria (BMI ≥ 30)
and 42% (10/24) had hypertension. The median hospitalization time was 8 days, and
21% (5/24) were admitted to the ICU. Eight of them (33.3%) met criteria for severe
COVID-19 disease.

SARS-CoV-2 viral load kinetics
The SARS-CoV-2 viral load quantification was performed from 92 RNA samples
extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs in the 24 patients at different time-points (24 at
baseline, 18 at day 3, 13 at day 6, 5 at day 15, 16 at month 1, and 16 at month 3) (Table
2). At baseline, 23 of 24 patients (96%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a median
viral load of 2227.17 copies/104 cells showing broad variability between patients (IQR:
69.78 – 7.42x104). Only one patient was negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification
but with low amplification of RPP30 indicating a deficient sampling. Overall, SARS-CoV2 viral load decrease overtime, and most of the patients (80%) were negative one month
after the diagnosis (Figure 1A). However, 5 patients showed persistent viral load at
month 1 and 3. All these patients had severe disease (COV 006, COV 009 and COV
013) and/or comorbidities such as diabetes (COV 016 and COV 013); hypertension or
cardiovascular disorders (COV 016, COV 019 and COV 013); chronic lung disease and
HIV infection (COV 009) and dyslipidemia (COV 006). Two different profiles in SARSCoV-2 kinetics were observed during acute infection based on the COVID-19 clinical
outcomes. A delay for the significant decline of SARS-CoV-2 levels during the first 6 days
of follow-up was recognized for those patients with severe disease. Thus, while for
patients with mild/moderate disease a significant decline in viral load is observed since

the diagnosis time, for patients with severe disease is only observed after day 6 (Figure
1B).

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies kinetics
The anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies levels were quantified at different time-points
from a total of 109 serum samples (24 at baseline, 18 at day 3, 13 at day 6, 5 at day 15,
16 at month 1, 18 at month 3 and 15 at month 6) (Figure 2). Overall, a high variability in
the IgA baseline levels was observed among patients that progressively increase
reaching the highest median levels at day 6 of follow-up, and then, significantly decrease
until month 6 (p= 0.028). The highest levels of IgA at baseline and during the follow-up
were observed for patients with severe COVID-19 (COV 006, COV 008, COV 010, COV
014, COV 013) (Figure 2A). A similar pattern was observed for the kinetics of IgM with
an on-going increase reaching the maximum levels at day 6 with a significant decline
after that (p=0.028). Likewise to IgA, the highest levels of IgM at baseline and during the
follow-up were observed for patients with severe COVID-19 (COV 008, COV 011, COV
010, COV 020) (Figure 2B). For IgG there was also a gradual increase until day 6 with
a progressive but slowly decrease until month 6 reaching very low concentrations
(Figure 2C). Of note, IgG levels at month 6 were significantly higher than for a group of
30 uninfected controls (15.93 vs. 4.50 μg/mL, respectively p-value < 0.001) (Figure 2D).
The numerical data for IgA, IgM and IgG in serum during the study period are
shown as supplementary data (Supplementary Table 1).

Plasma cytokines kinetics
Plasma cytokines levels were performed in a total of 18 patients, 12 with
mild/moderate and 6 with severe COVID-19, at different time-points (18 at baseline, 15
at month 1, 14 at month 3, and 17 at month 6). Figure 3 shows the dynamic of the
median concentrations of the 9 cytokines assessed (TNF-𝛼, IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, MIP-1𝛼,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.13.439586; this version posted April 13, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

MIP-1β, IFN-𝛾, sCD25 and IP-10) for each group based on COVID-19 severity during
the study period.
At baseline, significant higher levels of IL-6, IL-8, and MIP-1β were observed for
patients with severe disease compared with those with mild/moderate COVID-19.
Overall, a similar dynamic was observed for some of the pro-inflammatory markers, IL6, IL-8, IP-10, TNF-𝛼 and sCD25 during the study period. By contrast, the dynamic for
MIP-1β, IL-1β, MIP-1𝛼 and IFN-𝛾 showed a different profile during the follow-up with
significant higher levels at month 1 (IL-1β and IFN-𝛾) and month 3 (MIP-1β, IL-1β, MIP1𝛼 and IFN-𝛾) among patients with mild/moderate diseases compared to those with
severe COVID-19. After 6 months of the acute SARS-COV-2 infection no differences
were found between patients with mild/moderate vs. severe disease.
The numerical data for plasma cytokines comparison between mild/moderate vs.
severe patients are shown as supplementary data (Supplementary Table 2).
Clinical, virological and host immune biomarkers for severe COVID-19 outcomes
A univariate analysis was performed to identify potential biomarkers associated
with severe clinical outcomes, defined as the requirement of invasive mechanical
ventilation, the admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the development of Acute
Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Higher levels of IgA, IgM, IgG against SARSCoV-2 and also the cytokines IL-6, IL-8 and MIP-1β at baseline was observed among
patients who developed ARDS compared to those without ARDS. Moreover, higher
levels of IL-6 and MIP-1β were related with either the need of invasive mechanical
ventilation or ICU admission. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 viral load at baseline was not
associated with any of the severe clinical outcome definitions (Table 3).

DISCUSSION
In this study we report that elevated levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, IgA,
IgM, and IgG as well as specific cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1β during SARS-CoV2 acute infection are associated with severe COVID-19, defined by the development of
ARDS or the need of invasive mechanical ventilation or UCI admission. IgG persists after
6 months of the diagnosis but at lower concentrations. Whilst the levels of some
cytokines (i.e., IL-6, IL-8, IP-10, TNF-𝛼, sCD25) decline one month after of SARS-CoV2 diagnosis, others (MIP-1β, IL-1β, MIP-1𝛼 and IFN-𝛾) showed higher levels at month 1
and/or 3 for patients with mild/moderate disease compared to those with severe COVID19. However, after 6 months after diagnosis, no differences in cytokines levels between
patients with mild/moderate vs. severe disease were observed. Interestingly, although
SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels were not associated with the clinical outcome, during the acute
infection, a significant delay in SARS-CoV-2 viral load decline was recognized for
patients with severe COVID-19 as compared to those with mild/moderate COVID-19
during the first 6 days of follow-up.
Overall, SARS-CoV-2 viral load kinetics follows the pattern described previously,
reaching maximum levels during acute infection and decreasing progressively until
becoming undetectable in most patients in less than one month following diagnosis [7–
10]. However, because of the close follow-up of these patients we were able to identify
a significant delay during the first days of viral load decay for patients who met the criteria
for severe COVID-19. Nonetheless, in our cohort, SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels were not
associated with the clinical outcome at any time point. There are some controversial data
regarding this issue, while some studies have not reported any association between
SARS-CoV-2 viral load during acute infection and COVID-19 severity [11,12] others point
out that elevated viral load could be used to identify patients at higher risk for morbidity
or severe COVID-19 outcome [13,14]. The controversial results might be explained for
the heterogeneity of the studies related to the different characteristics of the study

population and/or the methodology used for SARS-CoV-2 quantification and sampling
quality (i.e., normalization using copies/cells).
Although, 80% of patients showed undetectable viremia one month after the
diagnosis, in 5 patients we observed SARS-CoV-2 RNA persistence between month 1
and 3. Interestingly, all of these had severe disease and/or comorbidities (i.e., diabetes,
hypertension or cardiovascular disorders, chronic lung disease and HIV infection,
dyslipidemia). These observations are in agreement with previous studies that reported
an association between SARS-CoV-2 RNA persistence with severe disease [9,15] and
comorbidity [13,16–18] following remission of the acute symptoms. More recently,
Jacobs et al., highlighted the association between SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia with ICU
admission [19] and Tokuyama et al., described SARS-CoV-2 persistence in intestinal
enterocytes up to 7 months after symptoms resolutions [20]. Additional studies are
required to better understand the clinical significance of SARS-CoV-2 persistence in
different compartments (i.e., plasma, gut, upper respiratory tract) and its potential use to
monitor COVID-19 patients during the early acute infection and/or following the remission
of the acute symptoms.
We found that elevated levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during acute
infection are related with severe COVID-19. Those patients who developed ARDS
showed significantly higher levels of IgA, IgM, and IgG, compared to patients without
ARDS. These findings are in agreement with previous studies that found an association
between anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies levels and the need for intubation or death
[21,22]. Overall, we observed that anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgM antibodies decay
rapidly after the acute infection phase (i.e., at month 3, 54% for IgA and 77% for IgM
showed levels below the limit of detection) but the decline for IgG was less prominent
and persisted until month 6. These levels were still significantly higher compared to the
levels of uninfected controls (15.93 vs. 4.50 μg/mL, respectively p-value < 0.001). The
durability of the immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 infection is a matter of intense

interest and still remains unclear. Regarding the humoral responses, recent studies have
also reported that IgG levels persist between 6 and 8 months after onset of symptoms
[23,24]. However, plasma neutralization activity seems to decrease a few weeks after
the onset of the symptoms [25]. Understanding the dynamics of antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2 and the persistence of the neutralizing activity is critical to establish correct
prevention and vaccination strategies.
COVID-19 severity has been associated with an exacerbated inflammation due
to a massive release of pro-inflammatory components [4,5]. We have identified that
elevated levels of IL-6, IL-8, MIP-1β during SARS-CoV-2 acute infection are associated
with severe COVID-19 defined by the development of ARDS or the need of invasive
mechanical ventilation or UCI admission. Higher levels of IL-6 have been consistently
related with severe COVID-19 disease [26,27] and play a pivotal role in the cytokine
storm in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection promoting organ failure and severe lung
pathology [28–30]. IL-8 leads the activation and the recruitment of neutrophils to the
inflammation sites and has been implicated in inflammatory pulmonary diseases such as
ARDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma [31,32]. MIP-1β drives the
recruitment of a variety of innate and adaptive immune cells and high concentrations
have been reported in the serum and lungs of patients with certain acute respiratory viral
infections [33,34]. However, their role during SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear.
Some studies have reported a higher production of MIP-1β at the transcriptional level in
bronchoalveolar lavage cells isolated from the lungs of severe COVID-19 patients
[35,36], whilst other studies did not find an association between MIP-1β and severe
disease [28,37].
The levels of IL-6, IL-8, and MIP-1β significantly decline at month 1 showing
similar levels during the follow-up to those patients with mild/moderate disease. Overall,
a similar dynamic was observed for IP-10, TNF-𝛼 and sCD25 during the study period.
By contrast, the dynamic for MIP-1β, IL-1β, MIP-1𝛼 and IFN-𝛾 showed a different

evolution pattern with a significant increase at month 1 and/or 3 among patients with
mild/moderate disease compared to those with severe COVID-19. No differences were
observed in the levels of these cytokines 6 months after of the acute SARS-COV-2
infection between patients with mild/moderate vs. severe disease. Therefore, the
unbalance in the cytokine levels between severe and mild/moderate COVID-19 patients
seems to be restored after 6 months of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A previous study by Lucas
et al., [38] also reported no differences at the IL-6, IL-8 and IP-10 levels between
mild/moderate and severe outcomes after 20 days of follow-up.
This study presents some limitations. First, the relatively small size of the study
population mainly represented by men as during the first wave of COVID-19 in our
institution 86% of hospitalized patients were men. However, we were able to accomplish
a very close follow-up of the clinical outcomes, viral and host immune factors in this
population allowing interesting observations. Although we have identified IgG after 6
months of SARS-CoV-2 infection we did not assess their neutralization activity and
therefore the risk upon new SARS-CoV-2 re-infections. External validation should be
assessed to confirm the predictive value of our findings.
In conclusion, in a well-characterized cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 with
mild/moderate and severe disease and close clinical follow-up during and after 6 months
of SARS-CoV-2 infection we have recognized early host immune predictors of severity.
Higher levels of IgA, IgM, and IgG and the specific cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and MIP-1β
during acute infection were observed in those patients with a severe COVID-19 outcome.
Conversely, higher levels of IL-1β and IFN-𝛾 and at month 1 and MIP-1β, IL-1β, MIP-1𝛼
and IFN-𝛾 month 3 were observed among patients with mild/moderate diseases
compared to those with severe COVID-19. IgG against SARS-CoV-2 persisted after 6
months of the diagnosis.

FIGURE LEGENDS

Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2 viral load kinetics. A) SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels among study
period. B) Median SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in patients with mild/moderate versus
severe COVID-19. A) SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels among the overall study population
during the study period. The black dots represent the aligned individual values obtained
from each time-point. The solid line represents the connected mean values. The dotted
line indicates the established experimental threshold (below the lowest positive sample
obtained in our study). B) Median ± IQR SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in patients with
mild/moderate versus severe COVID-19. The solid line with black circles represents the
mild/moderate group and dotted line with black squares represents the severe group.
Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was performed for the decline of viral load between timepoints; p: p-value.

Figure 2. Absolute levels at different time points during the study period and
antibodies IgA (A), IgM (B) and IgG (C) kinetics in specific patients. D) Comparison
of IgG levels between uninfected controls and patients after 6 months of SARSCoV-2 infection. Absolute levels of IgA (A), IgM (B) and IgG (C) among the overall study
population (n=24) at baseline (B), day 3 (D3), day 6 (D6), month 1 (M1), month 3 (M3)
and month (M6) after SARS-CoV-2 infection and changes of serum IgA (A), IgM (B) and
IgG (C) antibodies in specific patients (n=19) at baseline (B), day 3 (D3), day 6 (D6),
month 1 (M1), month 3 (M3) and month (M6) after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients COV
006, COV 008, COV 009, COV 010, COV 011, COV 013, COV 014 and COV 020 belong
to the severe group. D) Difference in IgG levels between uninfected controls (n=30) and
patients after 6 months of SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=15) was determined by MannWhitney U test. ***, p-value < 0.0001.
