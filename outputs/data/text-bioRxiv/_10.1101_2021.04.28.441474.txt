Abstract

19

Antibodies from SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may target epitopes which reduce durability or increase the

20

potential for escape from vaccine-induced immunity. Using a novel synthetic vaccinology pipeline, we

21

developed rationally immune focused SARS-CoV-2 Spike-based vaccines. N-linked glycans can be

22

employed to alter antibody responses to infection and vaccines. Utilizing computational modeling and

23

comprehensive in vitro screening, we incorporated glycans into the Spike Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD)

24

and assessed antigenic profiles. We developed glycan coated RBD immunogens and engineered seven

25

multivalent configurations. Advanced DNA delivery of engineered nanoparticle vaccines rapidly elicited

26

potent neutralizing antibodies in guinea pigs, hamsters and multiple mouse models, including human

27

ACE2 and human B cell repertoire transgenics. RBD nanoparticles encoding wild-type and the P.1 SARS-

28

CoV-2 variant induced high levels of cross-neutralizing antibodies. Single, low dose immunization

29

protected against a lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Single-dose coronavirus vaccines via DNA-launched

30

nanoparticles provide a platform for rapid clinical translation of novel, potent coronavirus vaccines.

33

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (S3RS-CoV-2) virus is responsible for Coronavirus disease 2019

34

(COVID-19) in over 144 million people and 3.0 million deaths as of April 22th 2021[1, 2]. The Spike(S)

35

glycoprotein studs the surface of Coronaviruses virions and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) binds host

36

cell receptors to mediate viral entry and infection[3, 4]. Greater than 90% of COVID-19 patients produce

37

neutralizing antibodies (nAbs)[5] and RBD-directed antibodies often comprise 90% of the total

38

neutralizing response[6]. RBD-directed antibodies can correlate with neutralizing activity[7-9] and ~2,500

39

antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike have been described to date[10, 11]. This highlights the

40

importance of eliciting neutralizing antibodies targeting the RBD by vaccination.

41
42

Rational SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design should be informed by spike protein conformation dynamics, the sites

43

of vulnerability and mutations that cause potential vaccine escape. The S trimer has >3,000 residues

44

creating a vast array of epitopes and is targeted by both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies(non-

45

nAbs)[12-15]. Measures of RBD binding do not always correlate with neutralization due to presence of

46

non-nAbs, which have the potential to cause antibody-dependent enhancement[16-18]. In the context of

47

HIV, influenza and MERS-CoV, significant effort over the last few decades has focused on creating

48

immunogens that minimize non-neutralizing epitopes[19-26]. Since the initial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2,

49

significant headway has been made in identifying neutralizing epitopes, especially with regards to the

50

RBD; however, study of immunodominant, non-neutralizing epitopes has lagged[14, 27, 28]. Vaccine

51

immunogens should be developed with these key findings in mind.

52
53

Glycosylation is an important post-translational modification in viral pathogenesis serving versatile roles

54

including host cell trafficking and viral protein folding[29]. Mutations introducing potential N-linked

55

glycosylation sites (PNGS) [30] in other viruses such as HIV and influenza have contributed to immune

56

escape[31-34]. Structure-based vaccine design efforts have been employed to add exogenous PNGS to

57

block non-neutralizing sites and focus the immune response to neutralizing sites[20, 26, 35, 36]. These

58

approaches have not been widely applied to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development. Here, we develop an

59

advanced structural algorithm for optimizing PNGS into the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to focus the immune

60

response and enhance neutralizing responses targeting the Receptor Binding Site epitope(RBS).

61
62

Vaccine potency is important for an effective immunological response. Self-assembling, multivalent

63

nanoparticle immunogens (or nanovaccines) enhance the B cell activation and concomitant humoral

64

responses, kinetics of trafficking to the draining lymph nodes and uptake by dendritic cells and

65

macrophages[37-40]. SARS-CoV-2 nanovaccines developed as recombinant proteins can be difficult to

66

clinically translate due to arduous purification and manufacturing processes, and further do not tend to

67

activate CD8+ T cells[38]. In contrast, vaccine antigens encoded into a DNA plasmid can be delivered

68

directly in vivo. We recently demonstrated the speed of DNA vaccine translation by developing a DNA-

69

encoded full-length spike immunogen for clinical evaluation in 10 weeks[41]. DNA is easily mass produced,

70

temperature stable, not associated with anti-vector immunity and can be rapidly reformulated for

71

circulating variants, making it a key pandemic vaccine technology. We recently developed a DNA-launched

72

nanoparticle platform (DLNP) for in vivo assembly of nanoparticles which drive rapid and strong B cell

73

immunity and uniquely produce strong CD8+ T cells[38]. Here, we present a SARS-CoV-2 DLNP which has

74

enhanced immunity in multiple animal models and is capable of single shot protection against lethal

75

challenge. The single shot, low dose regimen reduces the overall amount of necessary product, medical

76

personnel, and time in the clinic, rendering the product more scalable to a global scope including resource

77

limited settings. The high potency and rapid developability of the DLNP platform can also enable quick

78

generation of booster vaccines for newly emergent variants. To this end, we developed a SARS-CoV-2

79

DLNP encoding P.1 mutations and demonstrate it is highly immunogenic.

Results

82

Mapping antigenic effects of N-linked glycans on the RBD To assess the feasibility of adding N-linked

83

glycans to alter antibody responses to RBD (Figure 1A), we built an advanced structural algorithm called

84

Cloaking With Glycans (CWG) for modeling every possible glycan on the RBD (Figure 1B). The PNGS

85

positions were filtered if the asparagine had low solvent accessibility or high clash score (Figure 1C). Next,

86

we surveyed energetics of naturally occurring glycans (Figure S1A, S1B) and employed glycan energy filters

87

for our designed glycan positions, as well as filters for protein folding energies and structural

88

considerations (see methods). This process led to the identification of 43 out of 196 positions for

89

experimental characterization (Figure 1C,1D).

90

To better understand single glycan mutants (Figure 2A), we produced each variant and measured

91

biophysical and antigenic profiles. We synthesized and screened the glycan variants for expression and

92

binding to ACE2 in a high-throughput, small-scale transfection format and downselected to 22 variants for

93

further evaluation (Figure 2B). To characterize the antigenic properties of the glycan variants, we utilized

94

14 RBD-directed nAbs, 2 Abs with inconsistent neutralization[42-45], and 6 non-nAbs[10, 12, 13, 15, 44-

95

51]. Most nAbs target epitopes in the RBS (RBD-A, RBD-B, RBD-C)[10] and some target outside the RBS[27]

96

(RBD-D, RBD-E and RBD-F) (Figure 2C). In general, we sought to identify glycans that do not interfere with

97

nAb binding and block non-nAbs. The reactivity of our set of antibodies to each glycan mutant was

98

determined by SPR and ELISA (Figure 2D,2E, Table S1). We observed reduced binding of neutralizing RBD-

99

A, RBD-B, RBD-C or RBD-D antibodies in the presence of glycans at residues 441, 448, 450, 458 and 481,

100

suggesting these could be potential vaccine escape mutations because they still bind human ACE2. In

101

addition, glycans at positions 337, 344, 354, 357, 360, 369, 383, 448, 450, 516 and 521 show dramatically

102

reduced binding to non-nAb(s). We did not observe effects on binding to our antibody panel for glycans

103

at 518, 519 and 520. We noticed similar antigenic patterns in glycan positions that reduce binding to

104

some of the non-nAbs as well as nAbs in RBS-E and RBS-F, suggesting there is overlap in these nAb and

105

non-nAb epitopes. In sum, our experimental screening exhaustively evaluated the effect of N-linked

106

glycans on the expression and antigenic profile of the RBD.

107
108

N-linked glycan decoration improves RBD directed immunity We utilized our single glycan data to add

109

sets of glycans to the RBD that maximally cover multiple non-neutralizing epitopes and preserve

110

accessibility to RBS targeted neutralizing epitopes. To this end, we constructed a glycan distance map

111

allowing design of three, five and eight glycan combinations which were experimental tested to

112

determine if the sets could provide optimized antigenic profiles (Figure 3A, S2A, S2B, S2C). Two of the

113

three glycan variants (g3.1 and g3.3) had heavily reduced binding to all antibodies in our panel. Eight

114

glycan variants (g8.1, g8.2 and g8.3) had slightly reduced EC50 to nearly all the RBD neutralizing

115

antibodies (Figure 3B). However, both g3.2 and g5.1 (harboring three and five glycans, respectively)

116

bound well to nAbs and had reduced affinity for non-nAbs (Figure 3B). Since new non-nAbs may be

117

identified in the future, we focused the remaining experiments on the more glycosylated variants (i.e.

118

g5.1 over g3.2), since they are more likely to reduce accessibility to epitopes recognized by non-nAbs.

119

We observed similar immunogenicity from BALB/c mice immunized with wild-type (WT) RBD or g5.1

120

RBD (Figure 3C,3D). To investigate the difference in specificity of the RBD elicited responses, we

121

employed an ACE2 blocking assay[52] (Figure 3E). We observed that RBD g5.1 elicited significantly more

122

ACE2-blocking antibodies than WT RBD, suggesting g5.1 is immune focusing antibodies to the RBS

123

(Figure 3F, 3G). This data demonstrates that combinations of strategically selected glycans reduce the

124

affinity of non-nAbs and focus immune responses to the neutralization-rich RBS or other epitopes of

125

interest.

126
127

DNA-Launched nanovaccines amplify and accelerate immune responses To develop multivalent

128

vaccines, we genetically fused RBDs to a set of four different self-assembling scaffold proteins[38-40,

129

53] with a potent CD4-helper epitope(LS-3) to help enhance germinal center responses[54]. Tandem

130

repeats of RBD have been shown to improve neutralization titers by 10-100 fold [55], thus we displayed

131

dimers of RBDs on some of our self-assembling scaffolds as well. We engineered nanoparticles using

132

our computational design methods[38], resulting in display of 7, 14, 24, 48, 60, 120 or 180 RBDs (Figure

133

4A). We rapidly screened 19 nanoparticles directly in vivo using a single mouse per construct at a single

134

low dose of 2µg. We observed that 14 of the 19 nanoparticles were immunogenic (Figure 4B). Strikingly,

135

rapid antibody responses were detected just 1 week after immunization with RBD g5.1 24mer, RBD

136

48mer and RBD g5.1 120mer (Figure 4B). In parallel, we expressed and purified nanoparticles in vitro.

137

In contrast to wild type RBD multimers, which we could not purify and were not more immunogenic

138

than RBD monomer (Figure S3A,S3B), we were able to purify nine glycan modified RBD multimers as

139

assessed by size exclusion chromatography with multiangle light scattering (Figure 4B,4C). To further

140

confirm assembly of the RBD g5.1 24mer, we employed structural analysis by cryo electron microscopy

141

(cryo-EM) for RBD g5.1 24mer (Figure 4D, 4E). We conducted immunizations with selected constructs

142

in BALB/c mice (n=5 or n=10) using a single low dose of 2µg (Figure 4F). RBD g5.1 24mer and 120mer

143

both generated strong binding and neutralizing responses (mean ID50 of 3677 and 791, respectively)

144

(Figure S3C). In C57BL/6 mice, we observed similar immunogenicity at 1µg and 5µg doses for select

145

nanoparticles including improvements in CD8+ T cells (Figure S4A-S4E). RBD g8.2 7mer and RBD g8.2

146

24mer elicit similarly strong humoral responses when administered as purified protein nanoparticles

147

(Figure S5). Strikingly, we observed strong binding and neutralizing responses in BALB/c mice

148

immunized with 5µg RBD g5.1 24mer against the emergent South Africa (B.1.351), UK (B.1.17) and the

149

Brazilian variant (P.1), indicating cross-reactivity and strong potential relevance against emerging

150

variants (Figure 4G, S6A). As proof-of-concept for expanding this platform to emerging variants, we

151

engineered P.1 RBD g5.1 24mers. Upon of BALB/c mice immunization with 2µg, we observed high

152

binding and cross-neutralization titers (Figure 4H, 4I, S6B).

153
154

Single dose of RBD nanoparticles affords protection in lethal challenge model To examine the efficacy

155

of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD nanoparticles with rapid seroconversion(RBD g5.1 24mer and RBD g5.1 120mer),

156

we pursued a lethal challenge study (Figure 5A). B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J(K18-hACE2) mice express

157

human ACE2 on epithelial cells including in the airway[56, 57] and can be infected with SARS-CoV-2

158

resulting in weight loss and lethality[58] providing a stringent model for testing vaccines[59]. Animals

159

were vaccinated with a single shot of 5µg and 1µg of our nanovaccines in K18-ACE2 mice representing

160

doses 5- and 25-fold lower than our standard DNA dose[41]. Prior to a blinded challenge, we examined

161

immunogenicity at day 21 and observed pseudovirus neutralization titers prior to challenge in all vaccine

162

groups (Figure S7). We also observed live SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization titers above the limit of

163

detection for all three nanoparticle groups with mean ID50 of 451, 1028, and 921 for RBD g5.1 120mer

164

1µg, 5µg and RBD g5.1 24mer 5µg, respectively, compared to a mean ID50 of 29 of RBD monomer (Figure

165

5B). The mice were infected with SARS-CoV-2 1x105 PFU/mouse intranasally and monitored for signs of

166

deteriorating health. We observed that mice immunized with nanovaccines had higher levels of protection

167

from weight loss(Figure 5C). As expected, the naive group of animals reached 100% morbidity by day 6

168

and 1/10 animals survived in the RBD monomer group. In both RBD g5.1 120mer groups had 6/10 mice

169

survived the challenge. Strikingly, immunization with RBD g5.1 24mer provided full protection from a

170

lethal SARS-CoV-2 challenge (Figure 5D). All but one animal that survived had a live virus neutralization

171

titer of >100 and 12/15 of the mice that succumbed to infection did not have appreciable neutralization

172

titers (Figure 5E). We observed a significant correlation between live virus neutralization ID50 titer and

173

body weight loss (Figure 5F). Viral replication was reduced in nasal turbinates, lung tissue and brain tissue

174

for mice immunized with nanovaccines relative to RBD monomer or naïve animals (Figure 5G). Thus, the

175

DNA-launched nanovaccines can generate potent immunity that provides protection from challenge with

176

a single immunization at a low dose.

177
178

Enhanced immune responses to nanovaccines in translational vaccine models One major challenge for

179

the clinical translation of vaccines is preclinical modeling of human antibody responses to immunogens.

180

OmniMouse® have humanized immunoglobulin loci-transgenic with human V, D and J gene segments[60].

181

As a proof-of-concept, we immunized OmniMouse®(n=3) with three different SARS-CoV-2 nanoparticle

182

vaccines and measured increasing RBD-specific human antibodies in serum (Figure 6A,6B). Most mice

183

produced high titers of IgG and a few had robust IgM titers (Figure S8A,S8B). We observed potent and

184

specific neutralization in all three groups at weeks 6 and 8 (Figure 6C, S8C). Thus, the SARS-CoV-2

185

nanoparticle platform can be employed in transgenic mice and induce human SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing

186

antibodies.

187

We assessed RBD g5.1 24mer in Hartley guinea pigs (n=6) to examine intradermal vaccine delivery at 0.5,

188

5 and 10µg in comparison to RBD monomer at 10µg. In contrast to the RBD monomer immunized group,

189

we observed full seroconversion of RBD g5.1 24mer immunized animals at a dose of 5µg (Figure 6D). High

190

levels of neutralizing antibodies were obtained in the 10µg dose group (ID50 of 1840) (Figure 6E). In a

191

proof-of-concept study of RBD DLNPs prior to the development of RBD g5.1 24mer, we immunized Syrian

192

Golden hamsters (n=5) twice 3 weeks apart with 2µg and 10 µg of RBD monomer and RBD 48mer (Figure

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.28.441474; this version posted April 28, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

193

6F). The RBD nanoparticle immunized hamsters elicited higher antibody titers after both first and second

194

doses and produced neutralizing antibodies unlike the responses in the RBD monomer vaccine groups

195

(Figure 6G). To assess the biodistribution of anti-RBD IgG, we measured ultrafiltrated lung lavages and

196

found antibodies only in the RBD nanoparticle groups (Figure 6H). In summary, we demonstrate that the

197

DLNP vaccines provide enhanced immunogenicity in guinea pigs and hamsters.

198
199

Discussion

200

New SARS-CoV-2 vaccines should (1) alleviate cold chain requirements for global vaccine distribution, (2)

201

improve immunogenicity for certain populations, (3) increase efficacy with a single dose and (4) protect

202

against emerging variants that reduce or evade current vaccine-induced immunity. We have

203

demonstrated that advanced DNA formulation and delivery technology coupled with immune focused

204

nanovaccines can provide a platform to address these translational obstacles for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

205

Viral glycan evolution results in antigenic changes with concomitant immune evasion. It has been

206

observed that for influenza, humoral immunity becomes restricted over time due to glycan additions[61].

207

SARS-CoV-2 mutational variants may escape from antibody-mediated immunity. Glycan mutational

208

variants may begin to circulate given their large impact on antibody recognition of virus. Here, we provide

209

a map of possible glycan additions to the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and their effect on a large series nAbs.

210

Interestingly, we find a glycan at position 458, 369, 450 and 441 can bind to human ACE2, but strongly

211

reduces binding to nAbs targeting the sites RBD-A, B, C and D respectively. We also show that addition of

212

glycans to RBD-based nanovaccines can improve expression, assembly and immunogenicity.

213

The synthetic DNA platform employed in this study can be leveraged for generation of enhanced

214

immunity, easier global distribution and rapid reformulation. New adaptive electroporation systems can

215

improve uptake of DNA plasmid by 500x[62]. In stark contrast to complex recombinant protein and RNA-

216

based product development, DNA-based production and purification are extremely easy due to

217

availability of off the shelf commercial purification kits used widely in research laboratories. DNA vaccines

218

are also much more chemically and thermally stable allowing storage at room temperature for long

219

periods of time. These characteristics of the DNA platform allows for new vaccines to be developed at

220

breakneck speed and distributed to resource limited settings around the globe.

221

A key finding in this study is the dose-sparing immunogenicity afforded by the nanoparticle designs. Most

222

SARS-CoV-2 vaccines require at least two doses[63, 64]. DNA vaccines often require higher vaccine doses

223

(25 µg in mice[41]

224

immunogenicity. Here, we observed strong immunogenicity and protection from bona fide SARS-CoV-2

225

challenge down to 1 µg. However, we did observe weight loss in 2/6 mice after challenge and low viral

226

titers in 2/4 mice sacrificed four days after challenge. Increasing the dose to 10µg or by prime-boosting

227

could improve on our results. In fact, our studies of DNA-launched nanoparticle vaccines in guinea pigs

228

and hamsters demonstrated greater immunogenicity than RBD monomer at a low dose of 10µg.

229

In comparison to other RBD nanoparticle systems, we have demonstrated significant improvements.

230

Recently, studies on two-component spike-based nanoparticle showed strong immunogenicity with

231

sporadic pseudovirus neutralization 2 weeks post prime[66, 67]. After 2 doses of the i53-50 RBD

232

nanoparticle vaccine, mice challenged with 1x105 PFU of a mouse-adapted non-lethal virus were observed

233

to have reduced viral replication[67]. SpyTag-coupled RBD nanoparticles induce binding but not

234

neutralizing antibodies 2-weeks post prime[68-71]. An RBD-HR SpyTag nanoparticle was observed to

235

induce immunity after 2 doses which after challenge with 4x104 PFU authentic SARS-CoV-2 could reduce

236

viral load in the lungs[72]. Here, the DNA-launched glycan modified RBDs could be genetically fused with

237

four different nanoparticles scaffolds, the simple genetic fusion results in a single vaccine product that

238

could induce binding and neutralizing antibodies 1 week post prime immunization and induce CD8+ Tcells.

239

We created a more stringent test of immunity than most previous studies as we used authentic SARS-

240

CoV-2 virus with 2.5-fold higher amount of virus (1x105 PFU) in the challenge and a 10-fold more sensitive

241

viral detection assay. Further, vaccines studied in this model mostly utilize a prime and boost to achieve

242

protection (personal communication, Texas Biomed). In this model, our nanovaccines could induce

243

immunity that reduced viral replication and completely protected from death at a low single dose of 5µg.

244

From the data, there is an 82% chance of survival if mice have a live virus neutralization titer >100 prior

245

to challenge. Given the protective threshold for neutralizing antibodies that we observe, we expect that

246

Methods

252
253

Cloaking with Glycans Algorithm

254

The modeling started with RBD structure PDB id: 6M0J. GlycanTreeModeler(GTM) is a glycan modeling

255

algorithm recently developed in Rosetta(unpublished). The Cloaking With Gycans (CWG) workflow utilizes

256

GTM for selecting single glycan addition positions on target protein. All steps in CWG are summarized in

257

a flowchart (Figure 1B). CWG begins with detecting native sequons and modeling all the native glycan

258

structures using Man9GlcNAc2 glycans on the target protein. In the next stage, a model is made for the

259

addition of a single glycan at each position. A given position in the protein is mutated to asparagine and

260

the i+2 position is mutated into threonine or serine. The model with the lowest energy i+2 position is used

261

for further evaluation. The Rosetta energy is computed for the resulting model. We filtered out positions

262

if the total energy of the model corresponding to that position had a total energy > 5 Rosetta Energy Units

263

(REU) more than the native structure. Next, the CWG algorithm builds Man9GlcNAc2 glycans on the

264

mutated position and measures repulsive energy of engineered glycan between sugar-sugar and sugar-

265

protein energy terms. We filtered out some positions based on structural criteria, such as avoiding the

266

mutation of positions involved in disulfide bonds. Man9GlcNAc2 glycans were utilized for simplicity.

267
268

Nanoparticle modeling

269

All nanoparticles were modeled with corresponding designed structures and linkers. Four nanoparticles

270

were used in this study: IMX313P (PDB id: 4B0F), ferritin (PDB id: 3BVE), lumazine synthase (PDB id: 1HQK),

271

and PcV (PDB id: 3J3I). Biological unit nanoparticle structure files were downloaded in CIF format. The

272

termini of the monomeric RBDs were aligned to the termini of the nanoparticle, rotational and

273

translational degrees of freedom were sampled to reduce clashing between RBDs and nanoparticles,

274

extended linkers of various lengths were then aligned to fuse the nanoparticle and immunogen with

275

simpleNanoparticleModeling from the MSL library as previously described[38].

Protein expression and purification

278

Glycosylated RBDs: A gene encoding the amino acids 331-527 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (PDB:

279

6M0J) was mutated at each position according to CWG. Nanoparticles were genetically fused to designed

280

RBDs as described above. DNA encoding the variants were codon optimized for homo sapiens and cloned

281

with a IgE secretion sequence into the pVAX vector. A 6xHisTag was added to the c-terminus of the RBD

282

monomer variants. ExpiF293 cells were transfected with the pVAX plasmid vector either carrying the

purification system and IMAC Nickel column (HisTrap™ HP prepacked Column ,Cytiva) for His-tagged

286

monomers and gravity flow columns filled with Agarose bound Galnthus Nivalis Lectin beads (Vector Labs)

287

for nanoparticles. The eluate fractions from the affinity chromatography were pooled, concentrated, and

288

dialyzed into 1X PBS before being loaded onto the Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) column for

289

further purification with Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL column for the His-tagged monomers and the

290

Superose 6 Increases 10/300 GL column for the nanoparticles. Fractions of interest were pooled and

291

concentrated for characterization. For antibody production, heavy and light chains were encoded in

292

pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1, and pFUSE2ss-CLIg-hk or pFUSEss-CLIg-hL2 respectively and were co-transfected in

293

equal parts using ExpiFectamine™ 293 Transfection Kit(Gibco) according to manufacturer’s protocol.

Surface Plasmon Resonance

350

RBD-antibody kinetics experiments were performed with a Series S Sensor Protein A capture chip (Cytiva)

351

on a Biacore 8k instrument (GE). The running buffer was HBS-EP (3 M sodium chloride/200 mM HEPES/60

352

mM EDTA/1.0% Tween 20 pH=7.6) (Teknova) with 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Each experiment

353

began with two start up cycles with 60 s of contact time and a flow rate of 50 µL/min. For analysis

354

methods, approximately 200-300 RUs of IgG antibodies was captured on each flow cell at a flow rate of

355

10 µL/min for 60 seconds. WT RBD or glycan variants samples were 5x serial diluted from 1000 nM in

356

running buffer and flowed across the chip after capture at a 50 µL/min rate. The experiment had a

357

120 second contact time phase and 600 seconds dissociation phase. Regeneration was performed with 10

358

mM glycine at pH=1.5 at a flow rate of 50 µL/min for 30 seconds after each cycle. Kinetic fits were analyzed

359

with 1:1 fitting and run through a script to filter out results that had poor fitting, low max RUs compared

360

to expected, and kon and koff constants that fell outside of the range of measurement. Experiments that

361

were flagged as poor-quality fitting by this script were not further analyzed.

Pseudovirus Neutralization Assay

364

HEK293T (CRL-3216) and CHO cells (CRL-12023: double check) were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA,

365

USA). Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-

366

streptomycin (P/S) antibiotic at 37ºC under 5% CO2 atmosphere. For luciferase-based virus

367

pseudoneutralization assays, HEK293T cells were transfected to produce SARS-CoV-2 S containing

368

pseudoviruses. Cells were seeded at 5 million cells onto T75 flasks and grown for 24 hours. Then, cells

369

were treated with 48μL GeneJammer (Agilent 204130-21), 6µg S_IgE_deltaCterm19_plasmid (Genscript),

370

and 6µg pNL4-3.luc.R-E- backbone (Aldevron) and incubated for 48 hours. For variant pseudoviruses, cells

371

were similarly treated with GeneJammer and backbone with 6μg of S_SA_IgE_deltaCterm19,

372

S_UK_IgE_deltaCterm19, or S_Brazil_IgE_deltaCterm19 plasmid. Transfection supernatants were then

373

collected and supplemented with 12% FBS, sterile filtered, and stored at -80ºC. Pseudovirus solutions

374

were titered and dilution to working solutions set such that they yielded >215-fold greater relative

375

luminescence units (RLS) than cells alone.

391

in the BSL-3 facility at the Wistar Institute. Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) were maintained in antibiotic-free

392

Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). To grow

393

a stock of virus, 3 million Vero cells were seeded in a T-75 flask for overnight incubation (37 C, 5% CO2).

394

The cells were inoculated the next day with 0.01 MOI virus in DMEM. Culture supernatant was harvested

395

3 days post infection, aliquoted, and stored at -80°C. For titering the virus stock, Vero cells were seeded

396

in DMEM with 1% FBS at 20,000 cells/well in 96 well flat bottom plates for overnight incubation (37 C,

397

5% CO2). The USA-WA1/2020 virus stock was serially diluted in DMEM with 1% FBS and transferred in

Animal Studies

411

C57BL/6, BALBc, and K18-hACE2 mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Malvern, PA) and

412

The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Omni Mouse® for human antibody studies were obtained from

413

Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (San Diego, CA). All studies were performed in accordance with

414

Wistar Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees under approved animal protocols. All animals were

415

housed in the Wistar animal facility in ventilated cages and given free access to food and water. For the

416

lethal challenge study, Texas Biomed were blinded to identity of vaccination groups and weight loss cutoff

417

for euthanasia was 20%. Intramuscular injection with electroporation and sample collection. Plasmids

418

were administered intramuscularly in 30uL water into the tibialis anterior muscle. Electroporation was

419

then performed using CELLECTRA EP delivery platform consisting of two pulse sets at 0.2 Amps at a 3

420

second interval. Each pulse set consists of two 52 ms pulses with 198 ms delay. At specified time points,

421

blood was collected via submandibular vein puncture and centrifuged for 10 min at 15000 rpm to obtain

422

sera. For cellular responses, mice were euthanized under CO2 overdose. Spleens were collected into cold

423

RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S.

424
425

Female Hartley guinea pigs (8 weeks old, Elm Hill Labs, Chelmsford MA) were housed at Acculab (San

426

Diego CA). On day 0 and day 28 animals were anaesthetized with isoflurane vapor and received

427

intradermal Mantoux injections of 100 μL 10, 5 or 0.5 μg pDNA immediately followed by CELLECTRA-3P

428

electroporation. The CELLECTRA® EP delivery consists of two sets of pulses with 0.2 Amp constant current.

429

Second pulse set is delayed 3 seconds. Within each set there are two 52 ms pulses with a 198 ms delay

430

between the pulses. Serum samples were collected by jugular or saphenous blood collection throughout

431

the study on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 42. Whole blood samples to process PBMCs for cellular assay were

432

collected from the jugular vein on days 14 and 42. All animals were housed in the animal facility at Acculab

444

In-vivo study was concluded with terminal blood, lung lavage and nasal wash collection. Lavage buffer was

445

prepared as PBS containing 100uM EDTA, 0.05% Sodium Azide, 0.05% Tween-20 and Protease Inhibitor.

446

Hamsters were euthanized by jugular exsanguination with intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 86.7mg/kg

447

pentobarbital sodium or overdose Isoflurane gas inhalation. Euthanized hamster was placed in supine

448

position and skin was disinfected using 70% Isopropyl alcohol. A longitudinal cut using scissors and blunt

449

dissection along the midline of the neck was performed to expose the trachea. An opening into the

450

exposed trachea was created by making a transverse, semilunar cut using #11 blade.

451

To collect nasal wash an 18ga blunt end needle was inserted toward the nose and gently proceeded

452

upwards until reaching the nasal palate. A syringe filled with 1.5mL lavage buffer was connected to the

453

blunt end needle and correct placement was tested by dispensing a small amount through the hamster’s

454

nares. The entire volume of lavage fluid was rapidly dispensed and collected directly from the nares into

455

a 5.0mL Eppendorf tube.

456

To collect bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL), an 18ga blunt end needle, attached to a three-way stopcock and

457

primed with lavage buffer (approximately 0.5mL) to eliminate empty airspace, was inserted forward until

458

just prior to the tracheal bifurcation into the lungs. The blunt end needle was secured in the trachea with

459

a silk 2-0 tie. A 3mL receiver syringe and a 10mL syringe filled with 9mL of lavage buffer was connected

460

to the blunt end needle via the three-way stopcock. The lungs were rinsed three times (3mL each time)

461

with a total of 9mL lavage buffer. Typically, 50% of lavage buffer was recovered.

462
463

Hamster biodistribution

464

Lung lavage and nasal wash samples were ultrafiltrated using a 2mL 100kDa cut-off ultrafiltration device

465

(Millipore, Burlington MA) spinning 1mL BAL or NW for 15min at 4000g. Ultrafiltrated BAL was diluted 1:6

466

and nasal wash was diluted 1:4 in ELISA dilution buffer and following washes and blocking as described in

467

the ELISA section added to half area assay plates (Costar) coated with 25μL/well of 1 μg/mL SARS-CoV-2

Negative-stain electron microscopy

473

Purified RBD g5.1 nanoparticle was dialyzed into 20 mM HEPES buffer, 0.15M NaCl, pH 7.4. A total of 3 µL

474

of purified proteins was adsorbed onto glow discharged carbon-coated Cu400 EM grids. The grids were

475

then stained with 3 µL of 2% uranyl acetate, blotted, and stained again with 3 µL of the stain followed by

476

a final blot. Image collection and data processing was performed on a FEI Tecnai T12 microscope equipped

liquid nitrogen. The vitrified specimen was then introduced into an FEI Talos Arctica electron microscope

484

(FEI). Automated data collection was performed in EPU (FEI) and 640 movie micrographs were recorded

485

with a Falcon 3 camera (FEI) at 150,000x magnification corresponding to an image pixel size of 0.97Å on

486

the object scale. Each movie micrograph comprised 50 frames, each frame was exposed with a dose of ~1

487

e-/Å2. Data processing was performed in Relion v3.1.2[74]. Movie micrograph frame alignment, spectral

488

signal weighing and summation was followed by CTF modeling (CTFFIND4[75]). Candidate molecular

489

projection images were identified with Relion LoG picking (~271,000). Image windows corresponding to

490

the candidate molecular projection image coordinates were extracted and binned by a factor of 2. The

491

extracted binned data was subjected to 2D classification. Manual inspection of class averages led to

492

identification of 93,348 molecular projection images selected for further data processing. Molecular

493

projections were re-extracted unbinned from the summed micrographs and iterative Euler angular

494

reconstitution and 3D object reconstruction was performed with a low-resolution ferritin density map as

495

initial seed. 3D refinement was performed both asymmetrically (FSC 0.143 resolution 3.98Å) and under

496

the assumption of octahedral symmetry (FSC 0.143 resolution 3.42Å). Since our objective was to map the

497

attachment sites of the RBDs to the ferritin cage, we made no efforts to improve ferritin particle alignment

498

in our refinement strategy for the present manuscript.

504

for 20 hours at 37°C with RBD peptides (15-mer peptides overlapping by 9 amino acid spanning the RBD

505

of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, GenScript), at 5µg/mL of each peptide in RPMI + 10% FBS (R10). The spots

506

were developed according to manufacturer’s instructions. R10 and cell stimulation cocktails (Invitrogen)

507

were used for negative and positive controls, respectively. Spots were scanned and quantified by

508

ImmunoSpot CTL reader. Spot-forming unit (SFU) per million cells was calculated by subtracting the

Splenocytes were processed as described in the previous section and stimulated with RBD peptides for 5

513

hours at 37°C with protein transport inhibitor (Invitrogen) and anti-mouse CD107a-FITC antibody

514

(BioLegend). Cell stimulation cocktail and R10, with protein transport inhibitor, were used as positive and

515

negative controls, respectively. After stimulation, cells were stained with Live/Dead violet (Invitrogen) for

516

viability. Anti-mouse CD4-BV510, CD8-APC-Cy7, CD44-A700, and CD62L-BV711 antibodies were used for

517

surface staining and CD3e-PE-Cy5, IFN-γ-APC, and TNF-α-BV605 (all from BioLegend) were used for

518

intracellular staining. The samples were run on an 18-color LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and

Competition assay

522

96-well Flat-Bottom Half-Area plates (Corning) were coated at room temperature for 8 hours with 1

523

µg/mL 6x-His tag polyclonal antibody (PA1-983B, ThermoFisher), followed by overnight blocking with

524

blocking buffer containing 5% milk/1x PBS/0.01% Tween-20 at 4°C. The plates were then incubated with

525

RBD at 1 µg/mL at room temperature for 1-2 hours. Mouse Sera (BALB/c ,terminal bleeds, week 6, n=5 )

526

either immunized with RBD-WT or RBD-gPenta was serially diluted 3-fold starting at 1:20 with dilution

527

buffer (5% milk/1x PBS/0.01% Tween-20 ) was added to the plate and incubated at room temperature for

528

1-2 hours. Plates were then washed and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with ACE2-IgHu at a

529

constant concentration of 0.06µg/mL diluted with the dilution buffer. After being washed, the plates were

530

further incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with goat-anti human IgG-Fc fragment cross-adsorbed

531

Ab (A80-340P; Bethyl Laboratories) at a 1: 10,000 dilution, followed by addition of TMB substrates

532

(ThermoFisher), and then quenched with 1M H2SO4. Absorbances at 450nm and 570nm were recorded

533

with a BioTek plate reader. Four washes were performed between every incubation step using PBS and

534

0.05% Tween-20. The assay was performed in triplicates. The average absorbance of the lowest dilutions

535

with saturating ACE2 signals was calculated to get a maximum ACE2 binding and no blocking. Each average

536

absorbance value was subtracted from the maximum to get an ACE2 blocking curve. The blocking titer is

537

defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution where two consecutive dilutions have readings below

538

zero. The maximum area under the curve is determined by calculating the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of

539

full ACE2 binding without the competitor. The AUC of the competitor is then subtracted from the

540

maximum AUC which provides the area between the two curves (blocking area) and is a measure of ACE2

541

blocking. The fraction ACE2 blocking is defined as the fraction of the blocking area to the maximum AUC.
