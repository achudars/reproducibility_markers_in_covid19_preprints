Abstract

20
21

A small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibitors have demonstrated the novel modality

22

for suppressing infectious diseases. Sixty-one siRNA molecules, predicted by the

23

bioinformatics programs, were screened for the possibility of treating severe acute respiratory

24

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using an in vitro plaque assay. Among six siRNA

25

leads with the efficacy of reducing plaque number, the siRNA targeting RNA-dependent

26

RNA polymerase (RdRp) showed a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced fever and

27

virus titer in the Golden Syrian hamster and rhesus macaque. These results suggest the

28

potential for RdRp targeting siRNA as a new treatment for the coronavirus disease 2019

29

(COVID-19).

Introduction

34
35

Coronaviruses (family Coronaviridae) are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense

36

and single-stranded RNA genome. Some coronaviruses cause diseases of varying clinical

37

severity, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory

38

syndrome (MERS) (1). More recently, SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which caused

39

the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has infected approximately 11,301,850

40

people and caused 531,806 deaths (as of July 6, 2020) globally (2). Despite the severity of the

41

COVID-19 pandemic, there are no specific drugs except for a comprehensive treatment and

42

management guide, which consist of symptomatic treatment, supportive therapy, and/or

43

antiviral/antibiotic therapy. However, the comprehensive therapy shows different clinical

44

outcomes for each patient because the efficacy and effectiveness of the therapy depends on

45

the medical status of each patient. Current trials of repurposing of drugs for COVID-19 have

46

shown no acceptable risk-benefit ratios except remdesivir and dexamethasone. However,

47

there are several candidate drugs for COVID-19 treatment under research or clinical trials,

48

such as antiretroviral drugs (HIV-1 protease inhibitor), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase

49

(RdRp) inhibitors (remdesivir, favipiravir), antiviral cytokines (interferon β), and anti-spike

50

protein monoclonal antibodies. Despite emergency use authorization of remdesivir for the

51

treatment of severe COVID-19 patients, no drugs have been approved for COVID-19 so far.

52

RNA interference (RNAi) has a specific mechanism to silence gene expression by

53

degrading messenger RNA (mRNA) targeted by small RNA molecules, such as microRNAs

54

(miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are complementary to mRNA (3, 4).

55

Recently, it has been shown that RNAi specifically silences viral gene expression and treats

56

infectious diseases caused by a viral infection (5, 6). Because RNAi treatments regulate gene

57

expression inducing diseases, they have the advantage of being used to develop drugs against

58

infectious diseases that are difficult to treat using chemical or small-molecule compounds (6).

59

Moreover, RNAi is an adequate method to deal with a pandemic because RNAi can be

60

synthesized and tested in a very short time when the target sequence is identified.

61

Our goals in this study are to develop siRNAs to target and silence viral genes of

62

SARS-CoV-2 for the inhibition of viral replication and treatment of COVID-19. In addition,

63

since siRNAs can be used for versatile treatment against other types of coronavirus

64

infections, the siRNAs were further selected by matching the target sequences in the highly

65

conserved regions with SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 variants. It is expected to reduce the

66

risk of ineffectiveness due to mutation at the target sequence (7). Among putative 61 siRNA

67

sequences targeting the conserved sequences of structure and replication genes, we obtained

68

six siRNA leads that showed a reduction in cytopathic effect (CPE) and the plaque assay in

69

vitro. Finally, we chose one of the most effective siRNAs that was less affected by mutation,

70

and then performed in vivo experiments with siRNA in the Syrian hamster and rhesus

71

macaque to confirm its protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2.

72

This study indicates that siRNAs are a rapid and effective treatment for new

73

emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, which may be able to diminish the impact of

74

possible future pandemics by developing treatments promptly.

Materials and Methods

82
83

Virus and cell culture

84

SARS-CoV-2 isolated from a COVID-19 patient in Korea was used. The pathogen

85

resources (NCCP43326) for this study were provided by the National Culture Collection for

86

Pathogens (8). Viruses were propagated in Vero E6 cells (CRL 1586, American Type Culture

87

Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium

88

(DMEM) supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; GIBCO, USA), 2

89

mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin) at 37°C for 3 days in a 5% CO2

90

incubator. As determined using plaque assay, the infectivity titers of the SARS-CoV-2 stocks

91

were 2 × 106 plaque-forming units (PFU/mL).

92
93

Design of siRNA targeting SARS-CoV-2

94

In this study, we obtained the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence of MT039890 from

95

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MT039890). We focused on seven regions of the

96

SARS-CoV-2 genome, namely the leader sequence, replicase polyprotein1a (pp1a), RdRp,

97

spike protein (S), nucleocapsid protein (N), membrane protein (M), and envelope protein (E)

98

to design specific siRNAs to inhibit viral replication. Potential siRNA sequences targeting

99

viral genes were predicted using the programs siDirect (http://sidirect2.rnai.jp/) and

100

VIRsiRNApred (http://crdd.osdd.net/servers/virsirnapred/). Among the siRNAs predicted, we

101

examined whether siRNA predicted sequences that targeted the sequence of SARS-CoV, to

102

identify the 21 siRNA sequences targeting the conserved region in coronaviruses. We further

103

selected 40 siRNA sequences from the rest of the predicted siRNAs that did not match

104

SARS-CoV according to two criteria: first, siRNAs that have a score of less than off-target

105

effects in two portals; second, siRNAs that have low mutation rate among variants from

106

Nextstrain (https://nextstrain.org/). We finally obtained 61 putative siRNAs, all of which

107

were 21-mer with dTdT at the 3´-overhang. The siRNAs were synthesized by Bioneer Co.

108

(Daejeon, Republic of Korea).

109
110

In vitro efficacy test using Vero E6 cells (siRNA transfection)

111

Vero E6 cells were inoculated into a 24-well plate, 1 mL each, through a 10% FBS

112

DMEM without penicillin/streptomycin to ensure that the 24-well plate is 80–90% confluent.

113

The next day, the Vero E6 cells were transfected with 100 nM siRNA using Lipofectamine

114

RNAiMAX transfection reagent (Invitrogen, USA), according to the manufacturer’s

115

instructions. The cells were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 3 h and washed with phosphate-

116

buffered saline. Next, the SARS-CoV-2 stock of 1 × 105 PFU/mL was diluted at 1/100 into

117

1x103 PFU/mL. Next, 200 µL each was added to make the final 200 PFU. The Vero E6 cells

118

were then infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 1 h 30 min. After infection, the supernatant was

119

removed, changed with 2% FBS DMEM medium, and incubated at 37°C for 3 days in a 5%

120

CO2 incubator. The cells were observed daily for CPE using a microscope (Zeiss, Germany).

121
122

In vitro efficacy test using Vero E6 cells (plaque assay)

123

To assess viral titers, a plaque assay was performed using Vero E6 cells in 6-well

124

culture plates. Briefly, subconfluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells were inoculated with 10-

125

fold serial diluents and incubated at 37°C for 1 h 30 min in a 5% CO2 incubator. After

126

incubation, the supernatant was removed and carefully overlaid with 1 mL/well of overlay

127

solution (1:2 mixtures of 1% agarose and 2% FBS DMEM) and incubated for 3 days. The

128

plates were then fixed and inactivated using a 4% formaldehyde solution and stained with

129

0.1% crystal violet.

RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. Total RNA was extracted from supernatants and

132

animal tissues using the PureLink RNA mini kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA) according

133

to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript III First-

134

Strand Synthesis Systems (Invitrogen) and then analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using qRT-

In vitro efficacy test using Vero E6 cells

138

The primers and probe targeting the SARS-CoV-2 E gene and the forward and reverse

139

primer sequences for real-time PCR were 5´-ACAGGTACGTTAATAGTTAATAGCGT-3´

140

and 5´-ATATTGCAGCAGTACGCACACA-3´, respectively, and the probe was 5´-

141

ACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGCGCTTCG-3´ (9). The probe was labeled with the reporter

142

dye 6-carboxyfluorescein at the 5´-end and quencher dye Black Hole Quencher 1 at the 3´-

143

end, respectively. Each 20-μL reaction mixture contained 2 μL cDNA, 10 μL 2X TaqMan

144

Gene Expression master mix (Applied Biosystems, USA), 0.5 μL forward and reverse

145

primers (36 μM), 0.5 μL fluorescent probe (10 μM), and 6.5 μL double deionized water. The

146

reaction was performed at 50°C for 2 min and 90°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at

147

95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 min, in a QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR system (Applied

148

Biosystems, USA). The standard curve was constructed using RNA from SARS-CoV-2

149

infected Vero E6 cells. RNA concentration was measured using a NanoDrop

150

spectrophotometer. After RT-PCR using random primers (10 μM), 10-fold serial dilutions of

151

the cDNA were used in duplicate to generate a standard curve.

156

whether Syrian hamsters were infected with SARS-CoV-2; 6-week-old male Syrian hamsters

157

were randomly segregated into 5 groups. Each group of the animals was inoculated with 4-

158

40,000 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 via the intranasal route. At 2 days post-infection (d.p.i.), the

159

lungs were harvested for qRT-PCR analysis. Next, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of

160

siRNA in the Syrian hamsters. SARS-CoV-2 inoculation of the animals was performed

161

through intranasal instillation of 1,000 PFU per head. Four hours after virus inoculation, the

162

animals in groups 2 and 3 were intranasally administered with siRNA (No. 14) 17.3 μg (low

163

dose) and 34.6 μg (high dose), respectively (Table 2). At 2 d.p.i., the lungs were harvested for

164

further analysis.

165

Third, we assessed the therapeutic efficacy in the rhesus macaque. Three male rhesus

166

macaques were randomly segregated into three groups of one each (Table 3). The animals

167

were inoculated with 4.0 × 106 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 through intranasal and intratracheal

168

routes under anesthesia. After 4 and 24 h, the animals in groups 2 and 3 were intratracheally

169

administered with siRNA (No.14) 2 mg/kg (low dose) and 4 mg/kg (high dose), respectively,

170

under anesthesia. All the animals were monitored daily for clinical signs, body weight, and

171

body temperature. Swab samples, including nasal, oropharyngeal, and rectal swabs, were

172

collected. The animals were euthanized at 3 d.p.i. All inoculations and handling of the

173

animals, as well as the method of euthanasia and collection of tissues, were performed

174

according to well-established protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use

175

Committee of the Agency for Defense Development (ADD-IACUC-20-12 and ADD-

176

IACUC-20-13). All experiments were conducted in consultation with the veterinary and

177

animal care staff of the ADD animal biosafety level-3 (ABSL-3) containment, in a facility in

178

which other respiratory disease-causing coronaviruses had never been handled.

Results

180
181

Design of siRNA targeting SARS-CoV-2

182

To design a siRNA targeting SARS-CoV-2, siRNA molecules were screened from

183

the whole sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (SNU-MT039890). We designed siRNA sequences and

184

then selected a siRNA that targeted the conserved sequence of SARS-CoV-2 for application

185

in the treatment of various strains of SARS-CoV-2. To target the S proteins, we designed

186

siRNAs in the less mutated region (HR2) and receptor binding motif (RBM). Among sixty

187

one siRNA sequences expected to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection, twenty one siRNAs,

188

targeting leader sequence, RdRp, S, and N, were primarily selected as the conserved region

189

sequences of coronavirus. Additionally, forty siRNA sequences, targeting pp1a, RdRp, S, N,

190

E, and M, were designed to be most conserved for SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants. All siRNA

191

candidates were 21-mer by adding two deoxythymidine (dTdT) at the 3´ overhang to enhance

192

siRNA stability and binding efficiency to target RNA (12).

193
194

Selection of efficient siRNA leads using in vitro efficacy test

195

We tested the efficacy of siRNAs to inhibit viral infection in the Vero E6 cells, in which

196

the CPE can be confirmed by apoptosis upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and plaque reduction

197

assay (13). After the Vero E6 cells were infected with 200 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 and treated

198

with 100 nM of the 61 siRNA sequences, the CPE and plaque assays were performed at 3

199

d.p.i. (Fig. 1a-1c). At 3 d.p.i., all siRNA candidates reduced CPE in SARS-CoV-2 infected

200

Vero E6 cells, while CPE was observed in the control group (data not shown). Based on the

201

results of the CPE and plaque assays, we selected six siRNA leads, showing a reduction in

202

plaque number. Six siRNA leads were subjected to the NCBI blast to ensure that they did not

203

target any human genes. RdRp, pp1a, and N mRNAs were targeted by 3 siRNAs (Nos. 9, 14,

204

and 36), 2 siRNAs (No. 26 and 29), and 1 siRNA (No. 61), respectively.

205

The Nextstrain website was used to monitor the data on SARS-CoV-2 mutation and to

206

confirm whether the regions targeted by our siRNA leads were less mutated (as of June 26,

207

2020). Mutation rates in siRNA-targeted regions were 0-0.002%, indicating that siRNA leads

208

can be used to treat most SARS-CoV-2 strains. Hence, the six siRNA leads were effective in

209

reducing viral replication in vitro and less influenced by SARS-CoV-2 mutation (Table 1).

210
211

Efficacy test of the No. 14 siRNA lead against SARS-CoV-2

212

With six siRNAs, we examined whether the replication of SARS-CoV-2 was inhibited

213

using a plaque reduction assay. Vero E6 cells were infected with 500 PFU of SARS-CoV-2

214

with or without siRNA candidates and the plaque assay was performed at 3 d.p.i. From the

215

results, lead siRNA No. 14 (out of the six candidates) showed the least plaque formation

216

(data not shown). To calculate the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50), the Vero E6

217

cells infected with 500 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 were treated with the siRNA No. 14 in a dose-

218

dependent manner (5-100 nM) (Fig. 2a-2i). Then, the CPE assay was performed at different

219

time points. The CPE started to reduce with 20 nM of the siRNA No. 14, and cell

220

morphology was similar in cells treated with 100 nM of the siRNA No. 14. EC50 was further

221

calculated using qRT-PCR to determine the copy number of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2m). From

222

the result, EC50 of the siRNA No. 14 was approximately 9.7 nM at 2 d.p.i. in 500 PFU

223

SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells. Recently, it was reported that EC50 of the antiviral

224

drugs, remdesivir, chloroquine and nafamostat, known to be effective for COVID-19 (14).

227

Clinical signs in golden Syrian hamsters and rhesus macaques

228

To assess the therapeutic efficacy of siRNA in the hamsters, three groups were

229

formed composed of a control group and two treatment groups (Table 2). At 2 d.p.i., the

230

control hamsters showed a hunched posture, ruffled hair, and mild cough. However, clinical

231

signs such as cough were not observed in the siRNA No. 14-treated hamsters. The three

232

rhesus macaques consisted of one control animal and two treatment animals (Table 3). After

233

anesthetizing the animals, three male rhesus macaques were inoculated with 4 × 106 PFU

234

SARS-CoV-2, administered at a dose of 5 mL through intratracheal (4 mL) and intranasal (1

235

mL) instillation. After 4 and 24 h, we administered the siRNA No. 14 through the same route

236

at low (2 mg/kg; G2) and high (4 mg/kg; G3) doses, respectively. At 1 d.p.i., diarrhea was

237

observed in the viral control and body temperature was markedly elevated compared to the

238

base level (Fig. 3c). SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques (G1) had elevated body

239

temperature, from 38.6-40.4°C, between 1 and 2 d.p.i. Interestingly, high-dose siRNA No.

240

14-treated animals (G3) showed a base level of body temperature over 3 days. All treated

241

animals displayed normal appetite and behavior.

242
243

qRT-PCR analysis of the Syrian hamsters and rhesus macaques

244

To confirm infection of SARS-CoV-2 in the hamster, we inoculated each group with

245

4-40,000 PFU SARS-CoV-2 by the intranasal route. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in all

246

hamsters, including the 4 PFU inoculation group (data not shown). We assessed the

247

therapeutic efficacy of the siRNA No. 14 in the hamsters and analyzed the lung of the

248

hamsters at 2 d.p.i. using qRT-PCR. The results showed that the number of viral RNA copies

249

from the lung tissue of the siRNA No. 14-treated hamsters markedly decreased by

250

approximately 104 viral copies compared to that of the control hamsters (Fig. 3a). Next, we

251

investigated viral copies from the trachea of rhesus macaques at 3 d.p.i. using qRT-PCR. The

252

number of viral RNA copies in the siRNA No. 14-treated rhesus macaques significantly

253

decreased by approximately 103 viral copies compared to that in the control animals (Fig. 3b).

254

These results indicate that siRNA No. 14 effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection and

255

replication in the lung and upper respiratory tract.

Discussion

258
259

An effective SARS-CoV-2 treatment is needed to end the COVID-19 pandemic in the

260

near future. To date, many reports have demonstrated that RNAi is a powerful method for

261

gene silencing, including virus infection and replication in vitro, in silico and in vivo (15, 16,

262

19) against SARS-CoV. Wang et al presented that SARS-CoV replication was efficiently

263

inhibited by siRNA in Vero cells. Li et al demonstrated that siRNA was significantly effective

264

in prophylactic and therapeutic regimen against SARS-CoV in Rhesus macaques (19). More

recently, a CRISPR/Cas13d system was reported for the therapeutic agent of SARS-CoV-2

266

(20). In addition, Chen et al showed theoretical predictions of the potential siRNA targets by

267

computation modeling in the SARS-CoV-2.

268

Animal studies on SARS-CoV-2 play an important role in understanding the

269

pathogenesis and development of therapeutic drugs. Recently, animal studies on SARS-CoV-

270

2 have reported that rhesus monkeys and transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 receptor

271

were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (17, 18). In addition, the pathogenesis and

272

transmission of SARS-CoV-2 were shown in Syrian hamsters (10). Efficacy test using siRNA

273

therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 has been reported not yet in the hamster and rhesus macaque.

274

However, efficacy tests including DNA vaccines and therapeutic antibody were reported in

275

the SARS-CoV-2 animal models (21, 22). The Syrian hamster model was used for

276

demonstrating protective efficacy of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The

277

hamsters showed typical clinical signs within one week after virus inoculation. Rhesus

278

macaque model was used for DNA vaccine test. Rhesus monkeys developed humoral and

279

cellular immune responses and, were protected against SARS-CoV-2.

281

SARS-CoV-2 infection, we tested 61 siRNA duplexes in Vero E6 cells. Among them, the best

282

lead, siRNA No. 14, showed strong inhibitory efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection and

283

replication in Vero E6 cells. To assess the inhibition efficacy of siRNA No. 14 for SARS-

284

CoV-2 in animals, we used Syrian hamsters and rhesus macaques. Our data showed that

285

SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA decreased in the siRNA No. 14-treated animals. Additional research

286

is warranted to determine the possibility of siRNA treatment for COVID-19. Further studies

287

would also be needed to address the safety and effective delivery methods of siRNA.
