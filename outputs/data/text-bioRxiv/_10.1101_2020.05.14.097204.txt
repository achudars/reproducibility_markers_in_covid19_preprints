Abstract
Objective: Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), exhibit not only respiratory symptoms
but also symptoms of chemo-sensitive disorders and kidney failure. Cellular entry of SARSCoV-2 depends on the binding of its spike protein to a cellular receptor named angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and the subsequent spike protein-priming by host cell
proteases, including transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Thus, high expression
of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are considered to enhance the invading capacity of SARS-CoV-2.

Methods: To elucidate the underlying histological mechanisms of the aerodigestive disorders
caused by SARS-CoV-2, we investigated the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins in
the aerodigestive tracts of the tongue, hard palate with partial nasal tissue, larynx with
hypopharynx, trachea, esophagus, lung, and kidney of rats through immunohistochemistry.

Results: Strong co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins was observed in the nasal
respiratory epithelium, trachea, bronchioles, alveoli, kidney, and taste buds of the tongue.
Remarkably, TMPRSS2 expression was much stronger in the peripheral alveoli than in the
central alveoli. These results coincide with the reported clinical symptoms of COVID-19, such
as the loss of taste, loss of olfaction, respiratory dysfunction, and acute nephropathy.

Conclusions: A wide range of organs have been speculated to be affected by SARS-CoV-2

depending on the expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Differential distribution of
TMPRSS2 in the lung indicated the COVID-19 symptoms to possibly be exacerbated by
TMPRSS2 expression. This study might provide potential clues for further investigation of
the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), driven by the novel severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is explosively spreading worldwide since
its first report in December 2019 1. Viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 have been found to be high in
the upper respiratory tract, especially in the nasopharynx 2, whereas that of SARS-CoV had
been reported to be high in the lower respiratory tract 3.
The symptoms of COVID-19 in patients are mostly similar to those of other
respiratory infections, including that of SARS: fever (43–98%), cough (68–82%), fatigue (38–
44%), sore throat (14–17%), and sputum (28–33%)

4,5.

Moreover, dysfunction of senses,

such as loss or change of taste (ageusia or dysgeusia) and loss of smell (anosmia), has been
consistently reported as a unique clinical feature of this disease (19–74%) 6,7.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the receptor responsible
for the cellular entry of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2

8,9.

Once the viral spike (S)

protein binds to ACE2, it is primed by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) of
host cells, thereby facilitating viral entry

10.

Thus, high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2

may be considered to enhance the invasion of SARS-CoV-2. Previous genetic studies had
demonstrated high expression of ACE2 on the human oral mucosa, including tongue
epithelium 11, and co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in both human nasal and bronchial

epithelia 12. However, histological studies have been limited.
Based on the aforementioned aspects, this study aimed to elucidate the underlying
histological mechanisms of the upper and lower aerodigestive disorders by studying the
expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 on the aerodigestive tracts of rats.

Materials and Methods
Rat tissue samples
Tissue samples were obtained from rats examined in previous studies

13,14.

Five

eight-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats were included in the control group. The following
paraffin-embedded tissues were collected: the tongue, hard palate with partial nasal tissue,
larynx with hypopharynx, trachea, esophagus, lung, and kidney. All animal experiments were
conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines and with the approval of the Animal
Care and Use Committee of the University of Tokyo (No. P14-051, P17-126).

Histological analyses
To detect the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the upper and lower airway,
histological analysis was performed by immunostaining. Four-micron-thick serial paraffin
sections were deparaffinized in xylene and dehydrated in ethanol before immunostaining.

Prior to immunostaining, deparaffinized sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide to
block endogenous peroxidase activity, and then incubated in Blocking One (Nacalai Tesque,
Kyoto, Japan) to block any non-specific binding to immunoglobulin. After antibody activation,
primary antibodies against ACE2 (1:300 dilution; rabbit monoclonal, Abcam, ab108252;
Cambridge, UK) and TMPRSS2 (1:1000 dilution; rabbit monoclonal, Abcam, ab92323;
Cambridge, UK) were detected with appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies and a diaminobenzidine substrate. Images of all sections were captured using a
digital microscope (Keyence BZ-X700) with 4× and 20× objective lenses.

Results
In the tongue, both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins were strongly co-expressed in
the taste buds of foliate papillae (Fig.1A, B). In the nasal cavity, the olfactory neuroepithelium
showed sparse ACE2-positive cells, and remarkable TMPRSS2 immunostaining in the
cytoplasm. In the villous brush border of the respiratory columnar epithelium, ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 were highly co-expressed (Fig.1C, D). In the palate, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were
weakly and diffusely co-expressed in the squamous epithelium (Fig. 1E).
In the epithelium of the larynx, TMPRSS2 expression was explicit, whereas ACE2
staining was weak and sparse. This tendency was similarly observed in the whole larynx

from epiglottis to the subglottis (Fig. 2). In the trachea, the cilia of primary tracheal epithelial
cells showed high expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. In addition, TMPRSS2 was
abundantly present in the cytoplasm of ciliated columnar epithelium (Fig. 3A, B). In the lung,
consistent with findings in the trachea, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were strongly expressed in the
epithelium of bronchiole, in alveolar epithelial cells, and in capillary endothelium. Remarkably,
TMPRSS2-positive cells were more abundant in the peripheral alveoli than in the central part
of the lung (Fig. 4A, B).
In the digestive tract, ACE2 was strongly expressed in the superficial layer of the
epithelium of hypopharynx and esophagus, whereas the cytoplasm of squamous epithelium
was only weakly positive for TMPRSS2 (Fig. 2A, B, 3C). In the kidney, ACE2 staining was
strong in the brush boarder of proximal tubular cells, weak in the cytoplasm of proximal and
distal tubular cells, and negative in the glomeruli. Expression of TMPRSS2 was strong in the
cytoplasm of proximal tubular cells, weak in the distal tubular cells, and negative in the
glomeruli (Fig. 4C, D).

Discussion
In this study, we reported the immunolocalization of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which
are considered to play a pivotal role in the manifestation of COVID-19. Co-expression of

ACE2 and TMPRSS2 may induce and enhance the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 into the organs
15

. Notably, strong co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins was observed in the taste

buds of the tongue, nasal respiratory epithelium, trachea, bronchioles, alveoli, and the kidney.
Remarkably, TMPRSS2 expression was much stronger in the peripheral alveoli than in the
central alveoli. In the upper and lower respiratory tracts, the whole epithelium showed
expression of ACE2 to a certain extent, whereas TMPRSS2 expression varied across sites.
These results coincide with the reported clinical symptoms of COVID-19, such as loss of
taste, loss of olfaction, respiratory dysfunction, and acute nephropathy 16,17.
The strong co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the taste buds may explain
the high incidence of ageusia or dysgeusia in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although
gene expression of ACE2 in the tongue had been examined previously 12, the present study
is the first to reveal co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins in the taste buds.
Olfaction is also impaired by SARS-CoV-2 6. The current study revealed the presence of both
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the olfactory neuroepithelium and respiratory epithelium, thus
providing the first step in understanding the pathogenesis of olfactory impairment due to
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Future studies to elucidate the mechanisms of sensorineural olfactory
loss in COVID-19 might provide novel insights into SARS-CoV-2-related olfactory dysfunction.
The lung is an organ highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. While ACE2 is

moderately expressed in the bronchial epithelium and in type 2 pneumocytes, TMPRSS2 is
strongly expressed in the cytoplasm of bronchioles and alveolar epithelial cells

18

. Although

ACE2 was found to exist on alveolar epithelial cells at approximately similar level as in the
whole lung, the expression level of TMPRSS2 protein was considerably different between
the peripheral and central parts of the lung. Considering the peripheral parts of the lung to
strongly express TMPRSS2, along with ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 may be considered to damage
the peripheral area at the very beginning of infection. Thus, the present study could
histologically resolve why chest CT reveals consolidation and ground glass opacities in the
bilateral peripheral lobes in confirmed COVID-19 cases

19.

The tracheal epithelium, as well

as nasal respiratory epithelium, was found to express both ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Unlike that
in the nasal respiratory epithelium, TMPRSS2 was more strongly expressed in the cytoplasm
of tracheal epithelium, hence suggesting the trachea to be more prone to developing clinical
symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection than the nasal tissue.
The palate, pharynx, and esophagus are similarly lined by squamous epithelium. However,
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was found to be quite different across the organs in the
present study. The palate displayed weak cytoplasmic staining of ACE2/TMPRSS2 in its
epithelium, whereas the hypopharynx and esophagus had high expression of ACE2 and
weak expression of TMPRSS2 in the epithelium. Weak-to-moderate co-expression of

ACE2/TMPRSS2 in the squamous mucosa of the oropharynx and esophagus may explain
the infrequent involvement of oral and throat symptoms in patients with COVID-19, without
advancing to severity. Regarding ACE2 expression in the vocal cords, previous studies had
provided conflicting results; while one study asserted lack of ACE2 expression in the vocal
cords 18, the other demonstrated ACE2 expression on the surface epithelium 20; the present
study supported the latter.
As for limitations of the present study, the evaluation was performed on young rats which
may not correctly reflect the backgrounds of COVID-19 in human. Future clinical case studies
and autopsy studies might strengthen this study.

Conclusion
This study demonstrated the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 by cells in the
tongue and nasal mucosa, as well as by those in the epithelium of larynx, trachea, and
bronchus. A wide range of tissues and organs are speculated to be affected by SARS-CoV2, depending on the expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Differential distribution of
TMPRSS2 in the lung indicated COVID-19 symptoms to possibly be exacerbated by
TMPRSS2 expression.
