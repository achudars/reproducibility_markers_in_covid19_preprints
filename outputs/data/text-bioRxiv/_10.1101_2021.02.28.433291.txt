Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) utilizes an extensively
glycosylated surface spike (S) protein to mediate host cell entry and the S protein glycosylation is
strongly implicated in altering viral binding/function and infectivity. However, the structures and
relative abundance of the new O-glycans found on the S protein regional-binding domain (S-RBD)
remain cryptic because of the challenges in intact glycoform analysis. Here, we report the complete
structural characterization of intact O-glycan proteoforms using native top-down mass
spectrometry (MS). By combining trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS), which can separate
the protein conformers of S-RBD and analyze their gas phase structural variants, with ultrahighresolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) MS analysis, the O-glycoforms of
the S-RBD are comprehensively characterized, so that seven O-glycoforms and their relative
molecular abundance are structurally elucidated for the first time. These findings demonstrate that
native top-down MS can provide a high-resolution proteoform-resolved mapping of diverse Oglycoforms of the S glycoprotein, which lays a strong molecular foundation to uncover the
functional roles of their O-glycans. This proteoform-resolved approach can be applied to reveal
the structural O-glycoform heterogeneity of emergent SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD variants, as well as
other O-glycoproteins in general.

Introduction
The novel zoonotic 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) global pandemic1 has led to more than
102 million reported cases and over 2 million deaths as of February 2021.2 The causative pathogen
of COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), utilizes an
extensively glycosylated spike (S) protein that protrudes from the viral surface to bind receptor
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry.3,4 The evolution of the surface S protein
is particularly important as it initiates pathogenesis,5 is the main target of vaccination6,7 and
antibody therapeutic design,8,9 and a substantial number of predicted mutations in the S protein
regional-binding domain (RBD) can potentially enhance ACE2 binding.10 Moreover, the more
than 636,000 viral genomic sequences generated from global molecular epidemiology studies (as
of February 28, 2021, www.gisaid.org)11 reveal the emergence of a number of variants in the S
protein, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 may be evolving to acquire selective replication advantages,
drug insensitivity and immunological resistance, thereby underscoring the need for new
technologies capable of rapid and deep structural profiling of the virus.12-14
Importantly, glycans flank the polybasic furin cleavage site of S protein necessary for S
stability during biogenesis and influence conformational dynamics by masking protein regions
from cleavage during ACE2 binding.3,15,16 How these different sites are glycosylated and how they
influence ACE2 binding are likely to affect cell infectivity and could shield certain epitopes from
antibody neutralization.17-20 The SARS-CoV-2 S protein carries 22 N-glycosylation sequons per
protomer which have been characterized in detail.21,22 However, characterization of Oglycosylation has so far been limited, with only putative O-glycosites reported,16,22,23 and the
glycan microhetereogeneity, including molecular compositions, structures, and relative

abundance, remains cryptic due to the challenges in O-glycan analysis.5,17,24-29 Importantly,
individual glycosites can give rise to many glycan structural variants, i.e. glycoforms, and these
differences in glycan structures, even at a single glycosite, can have critical implications on
biological functions.20,30-32 It is crucial to decipher the intact glycoforms of various O-glycosites
recently found in the S-RBD because they are expected to play a role in viral function and viral
binding with ACE2.17,22,23,33 Therefore, new methods capable of the comprehensive structural
elucidation of O-glycans are essential for understanding the functional roles of O-glycans on
SARS-CoV-2 pathology and provide new avenues for rational therapeutic development.28,34-36
Conventional methods to analyze protein glycosylation rely on the bottom-up MS approach
of analyzing glycopeptides obtained through enzymatic digestion.31,37,38 Although the bottom-up
MS approach is a high throughput method for global proteome identification of glycosites and Nglycan heterogeneity from complex samples, the relative abundance of various intact glycoforms
and the overall post-translational modification (PTM) compositions of different co-appearing
‘proteoforms’39 are lost.40-42 In contrast, by combining glycoproteomics with the top-down MS
approach, which preserves the intact glycoprotein enabling high-resolution proteoform-resolved
analysis,43-45 we could achieve the simultaneous characterization of the molecular structures, the
site specificity, and the relative abundance of various glycoforms. Furthermore, by integrating
native MS, which has recently emerged as a powerful structural biology tool to study protein
structure-function relationships,46-52 with trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS),53-55 we can
investigate the gas phase structural variants to achieve the direct quantification of individual
glycoproteoforms.

Here we developed a method for the molecularly detailed analysis of intact O-glycan
proteoforms of the S-RBD by top-down MS (Figure 1). For the first time, we harness the
capabilities of a hybrid TIMS quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer (timsTOF Pro)
(Figure 1C), which provides high resolving power and sensitivity for both selective and
comprehensive ion mobility separations of various protein structural variants,56-59 and the
ultrahigh-resolution of a 12T Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance (FTICR) MS (Figure
1D), to comprehensively characterize the O-glycoforms of the S-RBD, including the exact glycan
structures and relative molecular abundance (Figure 1E). We demonstrate that this native top-down
MS approach can provide a high-resolution and wholistic proteoform-resolved landscape of
diverse O-glycoforms to enable future structure-function studies of the S-RBD.

Results and Discussion
Native TIMS-MS analysis of the S-Protein RBD. We first prepared a native S-RBD protein
expressed from HEK 293 cells to perform native top-down MS for comprehensive glycoform
analysis (Figure 1). After ensuring reproducible native S-RBD protein sample preparation (Figure
S1), we used the TIMS, the front-end of the timsTOF Pro (see Methods for details), to achieve
high resolution ion mobility separation of protein conformers. TIMS, similar to other quantitative
ion mobility techniques, reports the rotationally average collision cross section (CCS) of proteins,
which relates to their overall size and shape, and consequently can be used to evaluate changes in
three‐dimensional structure.57 However, ion mobility mapping (Figures 2A) and MS1 analysis
(Figure 2B) reveal enormous complexity in the native S-RBD sample. The diffuse spread of the
ion mobility spectrum suggests multiple co-existing S-RBD proteoforms potentially arising from
multiple glycans (Figure 2A). Closer inspection of the ion mobility and native MS spectra reveals
significant glycan heterogeneity likely due to the multiple N- and O-glycans on the native S-RBD
(Figures 2C,D). The native S-RBD could not be resolved due to overlapping ion signals from all
diverse glycoforms/proteoforms carrying different charges, similarly as observed in complex
glycoproteins previously.40,53

proteoforms of the S-RBD inhibits its isotopic resolution.

The S protein is known to carry many complex-type N-glycans, with two glycosites
(Asp331 and Asp343) previously reported and extensively characterized on the S-RBD.21,22 By
contrast, the O-glycans of the S-RBD are less studied and their glycoforms poorly understood,
despite the potential insights they may provide to understand viral structure-function
relationship.17,21-23 Since our focus is on O-glycans of the S-RBD, we completely removed the Nglycans from the S-RBD using a native PNGase F treatment (see Methods for details) to minimize
the interference posed by the enormous N-glycan heterogeneity (Figure 3A). The removal of Nglycans constitutes >10 kDa of molecular weight loss compared to the fully glycosylated S-RBD,
as expected from the multiple proteoforms detected by TIMS analysis (Figures 2A,C).
Fortunately, we found that after complete removal of N-glycans, the remaining O-glycans on the
S-RBD were now fully resolvable by native MS (Figure 3B). Although the remaining PNGase F
was found coexisting with the S-RBD, further optimization of the deglycosylation treatment

yielded highly resolved charge states of S-RBD (Figure 3C). Deconvoluted MS analysis of the
isotopically resolved charge states revealed multiple O-glycoforms with molecular weights
ranging from 25.5 kDa to 26.8 kDa (Figure 3C inset).

We next used TIMS to separate and analyze the various S-RBD glycoforms after the Nglycan removal by taking full advantage of the TIMS front-end of the timsTOF Pro instrument.
After careful TIMS tuning and optimization of the ion mobility parameters (Figure S2), the
timsTOF was sufficiently sensitive to allow high resolution ion mobility separation of intact SRBD O-glycoforms (Figure 4A, Figure S3), in contrast to the poorly resolved native S-RBD
(Figure 2). The TIMS analysis revealed two distinct protein gas-phase conformers separated in
regional mobility between 1.1 to 1.45 1/K0. By interrogating each of the resolved mobility regions,

MS1 analysis revealed that the two gas-phase conformers show shifts in the relative abundance of
the S-RBD charge states (Figure 4B). The shift in protein charging along with the regional
mobility shift together imply possible structural changes which can influence the protein ionization
between the mobility regions. This difference in protein conformers was further investigated by
plotting the corresponding ion mobility spectrum of the various regions against their calculated
CCS values (Figure 4C).

Applying this method, we further found two distinct S-RBD O-glycoform mobility regions
in the mobility Region 2 (Figure 4C lower panel). The smallest mobility region of the S-RBD Oglycoforms (Region 2a, 2511±5 Å2) is slightly higher than the theoretical value (~2200 Å2)

calculated using the IMPACT method60 from the S-RBD X‐ray crystal structure without
glycosylation.61 This discrepancy is likely a result of the influence of the additional O-glycans.62
CCS measurements of the various ion mobility regions of the S-RBD revealed progressively larger
structures between the highlighted mobility regions and further illustrates the separation of the
distinct gas-phase conformers (Figure 4D). Region 1 (2999±26 Å2) shows the largest calculated
CCS value compared to Region 2b (2705±25 Å2) and Region 2a (2511±5 Å2), implying that the
S-RBD glycoforms in Region 1 experience additional protein unfolding which increases the
overall protein conformer size and signal abundance under electrospray ionization.63 The
variations in S-RBD O-glycoforms CCSs are mobility region specific and consistent with protein
conformer changes, illustrating the potential of this approach for investigating the gas-phase
structural variations of glycoproteins.
Comprehensive characterization of S-RBD O-glycoforms by high resolution top-down MS.
Although S-RBD glycoforms can be inferred from the timsTOF analysis, we cannot assign the
glycan structures or occupancy from only the results presented in Figures 3,4 due to the mass
degeneracy and microheterogeneity of O-glycans.40,62 To achieve in-depth glycoform analysis, we
further utilized an ultrahigh-resolution 12T FTICR capable of baseline and isotopically resolving
the S-RBD O-glycoforms for MS/MS analysis (see Methods for details, Figure S4). Following
further MS1 analysis, individual glycoforms were directly visualized with high resolution (Figure
5A,B). Following specific quadrupole isolation centered at appropriate m/z widths to capture
individual S-RBD proteoforms (Figure 5C), the resolved intact glycoforms can be characterized
by MS/MS using a combination of fragmentation strategies to achieve confident protein sequence
assignments (Figure 5D).

By applying this method on all detectable S-RBD proteoforms, a suite of MS/MS spectra
were generated for sequence analysis (Figure S5). MS/MS data were output from the Bruker
DataAnalysis software and analyzed in targeted protein analysis mode using MASH Explorer.64
This approach allowed for the direct characterization of the glycan structures and their

microheterogeneity to reveal multiple S-RBD glycoforms with Core 1 and Core 2 O-glycan
structures (Figure 5, and full details in Figures S6-11). This high-resolution method enables the
structural characterization of glycoforms that have not been previously observed. As shown for
one such example in Figure 5D (highlighted in the red box on the right), neutral loss mapping
revealed a Core 2 (GlcNAcβ1‐6(Galβ1-3)GalNAc‐Ser/Thr) glycoform (15+ most abundant charge
state, centered at 1760.5 m/z) with a GalNAcGal(GalNeuAc)(GlcNAcGalFuc) structure at Thr323.
The site assignment of this glycan to Thr323 agrees with previous studies reporting putative
assignments of other S protein O-glycans at the same site,22 which is reasonable given the presence
of an adjacent proline at residue 322, increasing the likelihood of an O-glycosylation site. Direct
visualization of MS/MS fragment ions obtained from collision-induced dissociation (CID) along
with the corresponding proteoform sequence mapping confirms the glycan structure assignment
with high mass accuracy (Figure S6). Additionally, the GalNAcGal(GalNeuAc)(GlcNAcGalFuc)
related proteoform without N-terminal acetylation (15+ most abundant charge state, centered at
1757.7 m/z) was also characterized (Figure S6). Therefore, the high resolution glycoform mapping
presented in Figure 5 illustrates a unique strength of this native top-down MS approach to achieve
isotopically resolved and high accuracy characterization of highly heterogenous glycoproteins, a
major challenge in intact glycoprotein analysis.40,65
We also identified and characterized core 1 (Galβ1‐3GalNAc‐Ser/Thr) O-glycan structures
such as GalNAcGalNeuAc (15+ most abundant charge state, centered at 1723.8 m/z) (Figure S7),
and GalNAcGal(NeuAc)2 (15+ most abundant charge state, centered at 1743.2 m/z) (Figure S8).
Interestingly, these two Core 1 O-glycans were previously reported for the S-RBD as potential
modifications, however the previous studies were not able to resolve the exact glycoforms due to
the challenges arising from inferring intact glycoprotein structures from peptide digests and the
12

signal low abundance of O-glycans under conventional MS analysis.22,23,37 However, our native
top-down MS strategy enables us to unambiguously reveal the exact glycoform corresponding to
each of these Core 1 O-glycans. Two additional Core 2 glycan structures were identified
GalNAcGal(GalNeuAc)(GlcNAcGal) (15+ most abundant charge state, centered at 1748.1 m/z,
with additional N-terminal acetylated proteoform found at 1750.5 m/z) (Figures S9,10) and
GalNAcGal(GalNeuAc)(GlcNAcGalNeuAc) (centered at 1767.6 m/z) (Figure S11).
This native top-down MS approach enables the proteoform-resolved characterization of SRBD O-glycoforms to identify and characterize multiple S-RBD O-glycoforms as well as a novel
fucose-containing glycoform with Core 2 GalNAcGal(GalNeuAc)(GlcNAcGalFuc) glycan
structure (Figure 6A). Figure 6A shows all of the 7 identified O-glycoforms of the S-RBD, which
are also listed in the table in Figure 6B. As a unique advantage of the top-down MS approach, the
molecular abundance of each intact protein glycoform can be relatively quantified. We found that
the relative abundance of Core 1 to Core 2 S-RBD O-glycan structures was roughly 70:30, with
the Core 1 GalNAcGal(NeuAc)2 being the most abundant O-glycoform (~67% relative abundance)
(Figure 6B). This ability to unambiguously elucidate the structure of a specific S-RBD glycoform
with high accuracy and quantify its relative abundance demonstrates the distinct advantages of this
native top-down MS strategy over glycopeptide-based bottom-up MS approaches.47,62 Together,
this proteoform-resolved intact glycoprotein analysis strategy enables the simultaneous
characterization of O-glycan structures of the S-RBD and its microheterogeneity, including
structure and relative molecular abundance (Figure 6C). Importantly, the accurate determination
of the relative abundance of intact glycoforms provides the technical foundation to understand the
functional significance of these distinct glycoforms of S protein in the future. Although these
identified O-glycoforms are specifically for S-RBD expressed from HEK293 systems, the

Conclusion
In summary, the combination of native trapped ion mobility MS from timsTOF and native topdown MS from ultrahigh-resolution FTICR enables the deep and comprehensive analysis of the
intact glycoforms of the S-RBD, for the first time. Importantly, we report the complete structural
characterization of seven S-RBD glycoforms, along with a Core 2 fucosylated glycan structure not

previously reported. Moreover, the relative molecular abundances of each of these intact
glycoforms can be quantified, providing new insights into the complex landscape of S-RBD Oglycosylation. Our proteoform-resolved method provides complete structural characterization of
O-glycan microheterogeneity and complex glycoproteins. This native top-down mass
spectrometry approach not only enables the comprehensive analysis of the S-RBD and the
molecular signatures of emerging S-RBD variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus toward the structurefunction studies in the future, but also can help catalyze the studies of other O-glycoproteins in
general.

Complete N-glycan removal for O-glycan protein analysis. Peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase
F) (New England Biolabs Inc., Cat. P0704S) was used for complete removal of N-linked
oligosaccharides. Briefly, 20 μg of protein sample was buffer exchanging into 150 mM AA (pH =

to 20 μM in 50:50:0.1 (acetonitrile: water: formic acid) prior to top-down MS analysis. Protein
samples subjected to N-glycan removal were prepared similarly following PNGase F reaction.

Top-down MS analysis. Intact protein samples were analyzed by nano-electrospray ionization via
direct infusion using a TriVersa Nanomate system (Advion BioSciences, Ithaca, NY, USA)
coupled to a solariX XR 12-Tesla Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance mass spectrometer
(FTICR-MS, Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA). For the nano-electrospray ionization source using
a TriVersa Nanomate, the desolvating gas pressure was set at 0.45 PSI and the voltage was set to

1.2 to 1.6 kV versus the inlet of the mass spectrometer. Source dry gas flow rate was set to 4 L/min
at 124 °C. For the source optics, the capillary exit, deflector plate, funnel 1, skimmer voltage,
funnel RF amplitude, octopole frequency, octopole RF amplitude, collision cell RF frequency, and
collision cell RF amplitude were optimized at 190 V, 200 V, 100 V, 35 V, 250 Vpp, 2 MHz, 490
Vpp, 2MHz, and 2000 Vpp, respectively. Mass spectra were acquired with an acquisition size of
4M, in the mass range between 200-4000 m/z (with a resolution of 530,000 at 400 m/z), and a
minimum of 250 scans were accumulated for each sample. Ions were accumulated in the collision
cell for 0.100 s, and a time of flight of 1.500 ms was used prior to their transfer to the ICR cell.
For collision-induced dissociation (CID) tandem MS (MS/MS) experiments, the collision energy
was varied from 10 to 30V, ion accumulation was optimized at 400 ms, and file size was 4M.
Tandem mass spectra were output from the DataAnalysis 4.3 (Bruker Daltonics) software and
analyzed using MASH Explorer.64

Native top-down MS analysis. A timsTOF Pro mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen,
Germany) was couple to a Bruker nanoElute LC system (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany).
Samples were directly infused using the nanoElute, injecting 5 μL of native protein sample with a
flow rate of 1 μL/min. For the MS inlet, the endplate offset and capillary voltage were set to 500
V and 3800 V, respectively. The nebulizer gas pressure (N2) was set to 1.5 bar, with a dry gas flow
rate of 6 L/min at 180 °C. The tunnel out, tunnel in, and TOF vacuum pressures were set to 0.8584
mBar, 2.577 mBar, and 1.752E-07 mBar. To calibrate the MS and trapped ion mobility
spectrometry (TIMS) device, Agilent tune mix was directly infused to provide species of known
mass and reduced mobility.37 For MS calibration, the MS resolution for the most abundant
calibrant signal, 1222 m/z, was 62,000. Calibrant points at 922, 1222, and 1522 m/z were used for

TIMS calibration. The TIMS resolution for the most abundant calibrant signal, 1222 m/z, was 80.2
CCS/ΔCCS. IMS tunnel voltage deltas were optimized at -20 V, -120 V, 70 V, 200 V, 0 V and
100 V for Δ1 to Δ6, respectively. TIMS funnel 1 RF was set to 350 Vpp, and TIMS collision cell
energy was set to 250 V. An IMS imeX accumulation time and cycle ramp time of 400 ms was
found to yield optimal TIMS resolving power. To facilitate high MS signal intensity, the TIMS
accumulation time was locked to a 100% duty cycle, or 400 ms accumulation time. In the MS
transfer optics the funnel 1 RF, funnel 2 RF, deflection delta, in-source collision induced
dissociation (isCID) energy, multipole RF, and quadrupole ion energy were optimized at, 350 Vpp,
500 Vpp, 55 V, 0 eV, 800 Vpp, and 4 eV, respectively. For MS1 spectral collection, the quadrupole
low mass was set to 1000 m/z with a scan range of 200 to 5000 m/z. Collision energy was set to 6
eV, with 3500 Vpp collision cell RF, a 100 μs transfer time, and a pre pulse storage time of 35 μs.
For MS2 spectral collection the quadrupole low mass was set to 200 m/z with a scan range of 200
to 5000 m/z. The collision cell RF was set to 3500 Vpp, a 100 μs transfer time, and a pre pulse
storage time of 20 μs were used. Mass spectra were output from the DataAnalysis 5.3 (Bruker
Daltonics) software and analyzed using MASH Explorer.64

Data Analysis. All data were processed and analyzed using Compass DataAnalysis 4.3/5.3 and
MASH Explorer.64 Maximum Entropy algorithm (Bruker Daltonics) was used to deconvolute all
mass spectra with the resolution set to 80,000 for the timsTOF Pro or with instrument peak width
set to 0.05 for the 12T FTICR. Sophisticated Numerical Annotation Procedure (SNAP) peakpicking algorithm (quality factor: 0.4; signal-to-noise ratio (S/N): 3.0; intensity threshold: 500)
was applied to determine the monoisotopic mass of all detected ions. The relative abundance for
each protein isoform was determined using DataAnalysis. To quantify protein modifications, the

relative abundances of specific modifications were calculated as their corresponding percentages
among all the detected protein forms in the deconvoluted averaged mass. MS/MS data were output
from the DataAnalysis software and analyzed using MASH Explorer64 for proteoform
identification and sequence mapping. All the program-processed data were manually validated.
For peak picking, the sophisticated numerical annotation procedure (SNAP) algorithm from
Bruker DataAnalysis 5.3 was used with a quality threshold of 0.5 and an S/N lower threshold of
3. All fragment ions were manually validated using MASH Explorer. Peak extraction was
performed using a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 and a minimum fit of 60%, and all peaks were
subjected to manual validation. All identifications were made with satisfactory numbers of
assigned fragment (>10), and a 25-ppm mass tolerance was used to match the experimental
fragment ions to the calculated fragment ions based on amino acid sequence. For ion mobility
analysis by the timsTOF Pro, the collisional cross section (CCS) in Å2 for a species of interest was
calculated via the Mason-Schamps equation (Equation 1):

𝐶𝐶𝑆 =

$% )*
%

Where μ is the reduced mass of the ion-gas pair (𝜇 = (!$"), where m and M are the ion and gas
particle masses), kb is Boltzmann’s constant, T is the drift region temperature, z is the ionic charge,
e is the charge of an electron, N0 is the buffer gas density, and K0 is the reduced mobility. Equation
1 was selected to agree with previously published CCS calculations.57,58,68 Theoretical CCS were
calculated using the IMPACT method.60
