Abstract

25

The newly emerged and rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 causes coronavirus disease 2019

26

(COVID-19). To facilitate a deeper understanding of the viral biology we developed a capture

27

sequencing methodology to generate SARS-CoV-2 genomic and transcriptome sequences from

28

infected patients. We utilized an oligonucleotide probe-set representing the full-length genome

29

to obtain both genomic and transcriptome (subgenomic open reading frames [ORFs])

30

sequences from 45 SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples with varying viral titers. For samples with

31

higher viral loads (cycle threshold value under 33, based on the CDC qPCR assay) complete

32

genomes were generated. Analysis of junction reads revealed regions of differential

33

transcriptional activity and provided evidence of expression of ORF10. Heterogeneous allelic

34

frequencies along the 20kb ORF1ab gene suggested the presence of a defective interfering

35

viral RNA species subpopulation in one sample. The associated workflow is straightforward, and

36

hybridization-based capture offers an effective and scalable approach for sequencing SARS-

37

CoV-2 from patient samples.

Introduction

40

The COVID-19 pandemic has spread worldwide with alarming speed and has led to the worst

41

healthcare crisis in a century. The agent of COVID-19, the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus

42

(family Coronaviridae), has a ~30 Kb positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome predicted to

43

encode ten open reading frames (ORFs) [1]. Similar to other RNA viruses, coronaviruses

44

undergo mutation and recombination [2, 3] that may be critical to understanding physiological

45

responses and disease sequelae, prompting the need for comprehensive characterization of

46

multiple and varied viral isolates.

48

To date, reports highlighting genomic variation of SARS-CoV-2 have primarily used amplicon-

49

based sequencing approaches (e.g., ARTIC) [4-7]. Attaining uniform target coverage is difficult

50

for amplicon-based methods, and is exacerbated by issues of poor sample quality [8]. Genome

51

variation in the amplicon primer region may also impact sequence assembly. Transcriptome

52

characterization can further contribute to our knowledge of mutation within the SARS-CoV-2

53

genome, and direct RNA long read sequencing, both alone and in combination with short read

54

sequencing, have been described [1, 9, 10]. Unfortunately, these analyses are equally

55

hampered by sample quality limitations and necessitate use of cultured cell lines.

56

Oligonucleotide capture (‘capture’) mitigates these issues as hybridization to specific probes not

57

only enriches for target sequences but enables the analysis of degraded source material [11-

58

14]. Capture enrichment has also been applied to viral sequencing, where a panvirome probe

59

design resulted in up to 10,000-fold enrichment of the target sequence and flanking regions [15-

60

17]. Direct RNA enrichment method has also been reported for viral genome sequencing, but

61

each sample was enriched separately followed by pooling for sequencing [18].

62

Hybridization-based enrichment of RNAs can also aid in the identification of gene fusions or

63

splice variants [13, 19, 20], which are particularly important for coronavirus biology. In addition

64

to encoding a polyprotein that undergoes autocatalyzed hydrolysis, coronaviruses employ

65

subgenomic RNA fragments generated by discontinuous transcription to translate proteins

66

required for viral replication and encapsidation. These subgenomic RNA fragments share a

67

common 62-bp leader sequence derived from the 5’ end of the viral genome, detectable as a

68

fused junction to interior ORFs [1, 10]. Direct RNA sequencing of cultured cell lines infected with

69

SARS-CoV-2 revealed that the junctional sequences are not evenly distributed between the

70

ORFs, suggesting that individual proteins may be translated at different rates [1]. How virus

71

translation profiles from infected human patients differ from those from cultured cells is as yet

72

unknown.

74

Here we have utilized capture probes and a streamlined workflow for sequence analysis of both

75

the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences and of the junction reads contained within the genomic

76

subfragments generated by discontinuous transcription (Fig1). The method can be applied at

77

scale to analyze samples from clinical isolates. Enriching for genomic and transcriptional RNA,

78

followed by deep short-read sequencing, sheds light on variation in clinical SARS-CoV-2

79

genomic sequences and expression profiles.

Capture enrichment and sequencing. cDNA libraries with Illumina adaptors constructed from

155

SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals were pooled into six groups (S1 Table). Pools 1 and 2 were

156

from batch 1 and pools 3-6 are from batch 2. The RT-qPCR Ct value of virus N gene varied in

157

these pools as follows: Pool 1 with 6 samples (Ct 20.4 - 28.34); Pool 2 with 5 samples (Ct 29.75

158

- 37.95; Pool 3 with 5 samples (Ct 17.3 – 38); Pool 4 with 6 samples (Ct 27.8 - 39.3); Pool 5 with

159

11 samples (Ct 33 - 38.9) and Pool 6 with 12 samples (Ct 32.9 - 39.5). Pooled cDNA pre-

160

capture libraries were hybridized with probes from the SARS-CoV-2 Panel (Twist, Inc) at 70oC

161

for 16 hours. Total probe length is 120 Kb. Post-capture insert molecules were further amplified

162

(12-16 cycles) to obtain the final libraries that were sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq S4 flow

163

cell, to generate 2x150 bp paired-end reads. To evaluate the effect of hybridization-based

reference genome (GRCh38.p13; GCF_000001405.39) database using a two-step BBTools

177

178

enabled, and fast search settings in order to determine and remove hg38/PhiX reads. Trimmed

179

and human-filtered reads were then processed through VirMAP [21] to obtain full length

180

reconstruction of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. SPAdes assembler [22] was also used for genome

181

reconstruction. The resulting assemblies were compared to those from VirMAP. A

182

reconstructed genome with >99% the length of the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome,

183

NC_045512.2, was considered a fully reconstructed genome. Plots were generated using R

184

(version 3.6.1) and the tidyverse (version 1.3.0) and ggplot2 (version 3.2.1) packages.

185

Alignments and reference mapping were done using mafft [23] (version 1.4.0) and BBMap

186

(version 38.82). Sequence variation compared to SARS-CoV-2 reference genome was

187

performed using the genome alignment from mafft with in-house scripts. For heterozygous

188

variant analysis, the sequence reads were aligned to the reference genome using BWA-mem

189

[24] with default parameters, realigned using GATK [25], and variants were called using Atlas-

190

SNP2 [26]. Variant annotation was performed with SnpEff [27] Lineage assignment of SARS-

Results

204

A total of 45 samples collected from 32 patients between March 18 and April 25, 2020 in

205

Houston, Tx, USA were analyzed. These were a subset of individuals tested for the presence of

206

SARS-CoV-2 early during the pandemic. RNA fractions were isolated from viral transport media

207

and converted to cDNA. SARS-CoV-2 cDNA libraries were pooled into six groups (S1 Table). All

208

45 capture-enriched and nine of the pre-capture libraries were sequenced on an Illumina

209

platform based on details provided in the online methods. A schematic workflow is shown in (Fig

210

Sequencing results and capture enrichment efficiency

213

A total of 7.15 billion raw reads were generated for the 45 SARS-CoV-2 positive samples

214

sequenced (S1 Table). Since this study was to optimize the methodology, samples were

215

sequenced deeper to ensure that results among samples were not biased. Sequences

216

were trimmed to filter low quality reads and subsequently mapped to the GRCh38 reference

217

genome to identify human reads (Fig 2A). Trimmed non-human sequence reads were analyzed

218

using the VirMAP [21] pipeline where between 7- 86.4% of total reads from post-capture

219

libraries mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 reference. One sample (192000446B), which had only

220

6.37 ng total RNA starting material, did not generate any SARS-CoV-2 reads. Overall, the

221

percentage of reads represented by SARS-CoV-2 was higher in samples with CDC protocol-

222

based RT-qPCR Ct values <33 (Fig. 2A).

indicate samples that provided full-length genome assemblies.

230
231

To estimate the capture enrichment efficiency, pre-capture libraries for nine samples, ranging in

232

Ct values of 20.4 to 37.95 (i.e. high to low titer in the original samples), were also sequenced,

233

generating 152.1 – 322.9 million reads per sample. Samples 192000106B and 192000090B,

234

with Ct > 37 produced zero reads mapping to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. In the

235

remaining seven samples, less than 0.022% of reads were deemed SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 2B).

236

Collectively, post-capture enrichment increased the SARS-CoV-2 mapping rate to 50.9%, a

237

9,243-fold enrichment.

238

Spiked synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA, encompassing six fragments of 5 Kb each, served as a

239

positive control and were enriched successfully at both 1,500 and 150k copies per sample (Fig

240

2C). In the 1,500 copy libraries (n=2), 3-5% of reads mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 genome,

241

while approximately 65% of reads from the 150k copy libraries (n=2) did the same (S1 Table).

242

This translates to an approximate 91,858-fold enrichment in the 1,500 copy libraries and

243

13,778-fold enrichment in the 150k copy libraries compared to their starting amounts in the

244

RNA. Three SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative samples were also sequenced, where <0.5% of reads

245

mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome at 3-5 locations that are not conserved in the

246

SARS-CoV-2 genome (S1 Table; S1 Fig).

249

In order to assess the ability of the capture methodology to assemble full-length genomes, both

250

the nine pre-capture and 45 post capture libraries were assembled using both the VirMAP

251

pipeline and the SPAdes de novo assembler [22]20.

252
253

Full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes were obtained from 17 of the 45 capture-enriched samples.

254

Genome coverage in these 17 samples varied from 1071x to 3.19x million (S1 Table).

255

Successful full-length genome assembly was correlated with Ct values below 33 (Fig 3),

256

regardless of the total reads generated during sequencing. No variability between samples due

257

to random priming of the cDNA synthesis or no gaps in genome coverage were noticed

258

using this method (S2 Fig) Two samples with Ct values above 33, 192000296 (Ct 33.9) and

259

192000354 (Ct 35.5), obtained from a single patient, also yielded full-length genome

260

reconstructions with acceptable quality (N ≤ 0.5%). Partial genome reconstructions were

261

achieved for the remaining samples although somewhat surprisingly, the correlation between

262

percentage of the genome that was reconstructed and the Ct value of that sample was not

263

tightly correlated when Ct values were above 33 (Fig 3). Full-length genome sizes of the 17

264

273

Out of the nine pre-capture samples, three (192000072B, 192000021B, 1920000003B), all with

274

Ct values < 27.4, yielded full-length genomes with 28x – 265x genome coverage, while in the

275

other four samples, genome reconstructions were partial and also had a poor genome coverage

276

of 1-6x. SARS-CoV-2 reads were not detected in the two remaining samples.

Alignment of DNA sequence reads from one sample (192000051B) to the reference SARS-

278

CoV-2 genome sequence NC_045512.2 that is based on the first published isolate from Wuhan

279

SARS-CoV-2 reference genome, revealed multiple heterogenous alleles (Fig 4; S4 Fig). Most

280

isolates spreading into Europe derive from the ‘B’ lineage (based on the Wuhan sequence), but

281

three samples including this sample contained an additional fraction of reads representing the A

282

lineage [29] (S2 Table). Further investigation of the clinical correlates of this observation are

283

underway. The genomic position 23,403 in the Wuhan reference strain had good coverage in 28

284

of the capture enriched samples. The A-to-G nucleotide mutation at this location that results in

285

the Spike protein D614G amino acid change was noticed in 23 of the 28 samples [30].

Characterization of SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic mRNAs

294

To identify and quantitate subgenome-length mRNAs, reads were aligned to the SARS-CoV-2

295

reference genome NC_045512.2. Only samples with full-length genomes (N=17 capture and

296

N=5 pre-capture) were analyzed for junction reads to avoid introduction of any bias in identifying

297

subgenomic RNA due to gaps in sequence coverage (Fig 5A and S3 Table). While full-length

298

genomes were reconstructed from three pre-capture samples, an additional two samples with

299

>95% genomes reconstructed, 192000135B (with 97.4%) and 192000088B (95.3%), were also

300

included in this comparison (Fig 5A and in S4 Table).To characterize ORF expression in the

301

capture and pre-capture libraries, the number of junction reads/million were calculated and

302

plotted in Fig 5A (see details in S3 Table). Among the five pre- and post-capture comparison

303

pairs, junction reads were identified in more ORFs after capture, and in instances where

304

junction reads were found before and after capture, the expression trend agreed between the

305

two groups.

313
314

In the capture libraries, junction reads were identified in all 17 samples in the S gene, followed

315

by ORF8 in 16 samples, ORF3a and ORFa in 14 sample samples, N gene in 13 samples, M

316

gene in 11 and ORF6 in 10 samples with remaining ORFs seen in between 3 to 10 samples.

317

Junction reads containing canonical leader sequences were not identified in ORF1ab in any

318

sample, suggesting the translation of ORF1ab from genomic RNA is independent of the

319

canonical leader sequence. The average number of junction reads/million was highest for

320

ORF3a (176.3), followed by ORF8 (104.3) and S gene (10.8). The N gene junction reads/million

321

average was skewed due to its high presence in sample 192000052B. Log transformed values

322

are shown in Fig 5A. For the remaining genes, the average was less than 10 junction

reads/million. The expression of ORF10 gene was detected in three of the 17 samples

324

(192000052B, 192000251B, and 192000440B) with expression values of 0.13, 0.13 and 0.02

325

reads/million (S5 Fig). Among the 17 libraries with full-length genomes, there is only one pair

326

192000296B (Ct 33.8) and 192000354B (Ct 35.5), sampled twice from the same subject

327

(Patient #12) and the junction read expression was lower but detectable in both of these

328

samples (S3 Table).

329
330

There were no gaps in the ORF read coverage in any of the 17 capture samples (Fig 5B). From

331

5' to 3' of the genome, there was a gradual increase in the read coverage as expected, for the

332

genomic and subgenomic (transcriptomic) RNA reads. Across the genes in these 17 samples,

333

ORF1ab and ORF3a had the lowest reads per kilobase million (RPKM) values (average 32509

334

and 27957 RPKM, respectively) while the highest values were seen for ORF10 with a count of

335

121,643 (Fig 5B).

Discussion

338

We employed a hybridization-based oligonucleotide capture methodology, combined with short

339

DNA read sequencing, for culture-free genome reconstruction and transcriptome

340

characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The approach provided complete viral genome

341

sequences and identified sub genomic fragments containing ORFs, shedding light on SARS-

342

CoV-2 transcription in clinical samples. This method uses routine cDNA and library preparation

343

along with Illumina sequencing, employing 96 or more barcodes. Patient samples can be pooled

344

for capture and sequencing, to generate sequence data in large numbers.

345

The capture method provided considerable enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 in all samples tested.

346

The enrichment efficiency was calibrated using two spike-in synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA

347

controls in the background of human UHR, and yielded a 91,858-fold enrichment in the 1,500

348

copy (Ct=36.2), libraries and 13,778-fold enrichment in the 150k copy (Ct=29.6) reconstructed

349

samples. For nine patient samples, where sequence data from pre and post capture libraries

350

were compared, a 9,243-fold enrichment was observed. Some human sequences were

351

observed in the data generated from low viral load samples (CT>33) and these were removed in

352

silico15, and did not effectively interfere with the enrichment. Some unevenness in SARS-CoV-2

353

sequence representation was initially observed when pooling samples within a range of Ct.

354

values. This was managed by pooling groups of samples based upon their range of CT values

355

before capture enrichment.

356

Full length SARS-CoV-2 genomes were able to be assembled from 17 of the 45 samples

357

analyzed. High quality, full-length reconstructions from capture enrichment appears to be

358

reliably achieved with a viral Ct <33. Between a Ct of 33 and 36, the full-length genome is

359

recovered in some samples while partial genomes, consisting of >50% of the genome length,

360

were reconstructed for the majority (Fig 3). For Sars-Cov-2 genome sequencing, multiplex

361

amplicon sequencing has been used the most to date which includes the primer pools designed

362

by ARTIC consortium (V1 V2 and latest is V3) as well as a third version NIID-1 (Quick J) [31]

363

[4]. ARTIC V1 primer set, worked well for full-length genome recovery with relatively high viral

364

load (Ct < 25) in clinical qPCR tests, as certain primer pairs were under performing. The

365

updated V3 and NIID-1 primer sets addressed this problem and were shown to work well with Ct

366

values in clinical qPCR from 25 to 30 [4]. A multiplex amplicon-based approaches by CDC23

367

where the effectively generating full length genome sequences <Ct of 33 although Ct. values

368

between 30 and 33, genome recovery varied between samples. In another report, ARTIC

369

primers were used initially for amplification of SAR-COV-2 clinical samples and the full-length

370

genome recovery from sequencing these amplicons were compared by different library

371

preparation methods for Illumina sequencing [32]. They reported that samples below Ct. <27

372

produced near full-length genomes, although from samples with Ct. <30, longer and higher

373

quality genomes were reported. In comparison to several of these studies, using the capture

374

enrichment methodology, full-length genomes were obtained consistently from clinical samples

375

up to Ct. 33, which is the ability to enrich 8-fold lower genome equivalents. However, as shown

376

from the data in (Table S1), generating more sequence data for low titer samples does not lead

377

to full-length genome recovery. There is supporting information now based on the success rate

378

of the culture of the Sars-Cov-2 at different Ct. Values, where the probability of culturing virus

379

declines to 8% in samples with Ct > 35 and to 6%, 10 days after symptom onset [33]. Putting

380

this information together with our own observation of partial gnome recovery from samples with

381

Ct >33, suggests these individuals may likely be carrying only genomic fragments in them at the

382

time of the sampling.

383
384

Capture enrichment enabled identification of a mixed population of SARS-CoV-2 virus in sample

385

192000051B, including a putative defective interfering viral RNA species that likely is incapable

386

of translating the viral polyprotein encoded in ORF1ab alongside a replication competent strain.

387

All heterogeneously called alleles are in ORF1ab, the 20 kb gene encoding the polyprotein

388

essential to the replication of the viral genome. Only one of these alleles (T20520C) is expected

389

to produce a synonymous change in the coding sequence. All the other loci are predicted to

390

change the amino acid sequence of the polyprotein. Most notable is T1783A, which introduced

391

a stop codon early in the translation of ORF1ab. Introduced stop codons are rare among the

392

submitted genome assemblies tracking the evolution of SARS-CoV2 (nextstrain.org), but are

393

distributed all along the genome (S4 Fig). In some regions, these introduced stop codon alleles

394

occur in multiple loci along multiple lineages, one of which at a significant enough frequency to

395

be scored with high homoplasy [34]. The low phylogenetic signal disqualifies these loci from

396

much further analysis. A stop codon early in the ORF1ab gene should prevent propagation of

397

the virus, but it can possibly be complemented by the presence of a functional copy of the gene

398

from a co-infecting replication competent virus.

399

Defective interfering viral RNA can be replicated and packaged in the presence of replicating

400

viruses, and have been detected in other coronaviruses [35]. If the requirement for translational

401

fidelity of the ORF1ab gene were lost, it would remove any selective pressure on the remainder

402

of the gene and could explain the accumulation of additional mutations observed in the

403

defective species. It would not interfere with the generation of sub genomic segments of the rest

404

of the genome for translation of the proteins necessary to package the virus. Thus, the defective

405

virus can only be maintained in a heterogeneous population with a replication competent virus.

406

Engineering defective interfering viruses have the potential to modulate the replication of

407

functional viruses during the infection cycle.

408
409

Our capture approach enabled simultaneous detection and quantitation of the sub genomic

410

fragments. RPKM values plotted in Fig 5B were for reads originating from both genomes and

411

sub-genomes. Plotting of this data shows that capture is not biased in enrichment and that the

412

increase in coverage of the reads from 5’-3’ is in agreement with the transcription pattern of the

413

sub-genomes as described by Kim et al [1]. Kim et al. [1], reported SARS-CoV-2 quantitative

414

expression in SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells (ATCC, CCL-81) based on junction reads

415

obtained from Nanopore based direct RNA sequencing. In their study, the N gene mRNA was

416

the most abundantly expressed, but they also identified expression in eight other ORFs with

417

least expression noted in the 7b gene. They did not detect sub genomic fragments enabling

418

translation of ORF10. Here, we searched for junctions reads in our data and used them to

419

quantitate ORF expression patterns in the 17 samples with full length genome reconstructions

420

(Fig 5 and S3 and S4 Tables). Differences in expression were noted among these 17 samples

421

suggesting that ORF expression is patient-specific and interestingly, this patient group

422

expression pattern also differed from the profiles reported by Kim et al.[1],. Further, evidence of

423

the expression of ORF10 was supported by multiple junction reads in three of our 17 samples

424

(192000052B, 192000251B, and 192000440B). The SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage in these

425

three samples was among the highest (3,192,285x, 1,196,745x, and 793,028x), which might

426

have contributed to their discovery (S1 Table). ORF10 was also undetected in the other

427

transcriptome study by Taiaroa et al., 2020 using ONT and SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero/hSLAM

428

cells. ORF10 is 117 bases in length so it may have been missed by these studies due to its low

429

or absent expression in cultured cells. We note however that the capture methodology is limited

430

in its ability to identify the RNA modifications that were reported by the above two direct RNA-

431

Seq methods.

432

In summary, this capture enrichment and sequencing method provides an effective approach to

433

generate SARS-CoV-2 genome and transcriptome data directly from clinical samples. Samples

434

with Ct values <33, when sequenced to a depth of approximately 2 million reads (higher than

435

1000x coverage of the SARS-CoV-2 genome), appear to be sufficient for both full genome

436

reconstruction and identification and quantitation of junction-reads to measure differential ORF

437

expression. This article was posted on Bioarchive on July 27th, 2020. As a follow up to this

438

study, an additional 95 patient samples with Sars-Cov-2 Ct. values of 9.3-31.3 Ct. were

439

sequenced. For all 95 samples, SARS-CoV-2, full-length genomes were reconstructed

440

(unpublished data). This method has a straightforward work-flow and is scalable for sequencing

441

large numbers of patient samples.

S1 Fig. Genome coverage plots for the three SARS-CoV-2 negative samples. Coverage is

585

localized despite the 45-91 M reads that these samples obtained post-capture.

S2 Fig. Genome coverage plots. Genome coordinates on X-axis and coverage in log scale of

588

Y-axis for the 17 samples with full length SARS-CoV-2 genome reconstructions

589

S3 Fig. A multiple sequence alignment (using MAFFT) of 17 reconstructed SARS-CoV-2

590

genomes and Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome (NC_045512). Grey indicates agreement with

591

the reference, black is a disagreement, and pink marks areas in the reconstruction with an

592

ambiguous nucleotide, “N”. The pangolin lineage assignment is listed next to the sample name.

593

The extra length of the 192000251B seen here is an assembly artifact and was excluded from

594

analysis.

595

S4 Fig. Stop codon variants in sampled SARS-CoV-2 genomic assemblies. A snapshot of

596

full length SARS-CoV-2 genome assemblies from GISAID and NCBI on 27 May 2020 was

597

downloaded (comprising 39246 entries), and processed to detect single nucleotide variant

598

alleles that introduced a stop codon. Introduced stop codons were detected in 270 entries, and

599

the frequency of these alleles are plotted along the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome position.

600

Introduced stop codons are rare but are distributed throughout the genomic sequences. Multiple

601

loci harbor stop codons in unrelated assemblies.

603

S5 Fig. Junctions reads to support expression of ORF10 192000052B, 192000251B and

604

192000440B. Expression values were calculated as 0.13, 0.13 and 0.02 reads/million. Few

605

examples of those junction reads are shown in the figure (purple arrows).
