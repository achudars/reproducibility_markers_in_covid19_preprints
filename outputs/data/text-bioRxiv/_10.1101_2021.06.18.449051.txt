Recovery of deleted deep sequencing data sheds more
light on the early Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 epidemic

ABSTRACT The origin and early spread of SARS-CoV-2 remains shrouded in mystery. Here I identify a data set containing
SARS-CoV-2 sequences from early in the Wuhan epidemic that has been deleted from the NIH’s Sequence Read Archive. I
recover the deleted files from the Google Cloud, and reconstruct partial sequences of 13 early epidemic viruses. Phylogenetic
analysis of these sequences in the context of carefully annotated existing data suggests that the Huanan Seafood Market
sequences that are the focus of the joint WHO-China report are not fully representative of the viruses in Wuhan early in the
epidemic. Instead, the progenitor of known SARS-CoV-2 sequences likely contained three mutations relative to the market
viruses that made it more similar to SARS-CoV-2’s bat coronavirus relatives.
nderstanding the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan is crucial
to tracing the origins of the virus, including identifying
events that led to infection of patient zero. The first reports
outside of China at the end of December 2019 emphasized the
role of the Huanan Seafood Market (ProMED 2019), which was
initially suggested as a site of zoonosis. However, this theory
became increasingly tenuous as it was learned that many early
cases had no connection to the market (Cohen 2020; Huang et al.
2020; Chen et al. 2020). Eventually, Chinese CDC Director Gao Fu
dismissed the theory, stating “At first, we assumed the seafood
market might have the virus, but now the market is more like a
victim. The novel coronavirus had existed long before” (Global
Times 2020).
Indeed, there were reports of cases that far preceded the outbreak at the Huanan Seafood Market. The Lancet described a
confirmed case having no association with the market whose
symptoms began on December 1, 2019 (Huang et al. 2020). The
South China Morning Post described nine cases from November 2019 including details on patient age and sex, noting that
none were confirmed to be “patient zero” (Ma 2020). Professor
Yu Chuanhua of Wuhan University told the Health Times that
records he reviewed showed two cases in mid-November, and
one suspected case on September 29 (Health Times 2020). At
about the same time as Professor Chuanhua’s interview, the
Chinese CDC issued an order forbidding sharing of information
about the COVID-19 epidemic without approval (China CDC
2020), and shortly thereafter Professor Chuanhua re-contacted
the Health Times to say the November cases could not be confirmed (Health Times 2020). Then China’s State Council issued
a much broader order requiring central approval of all publications related to COVID-19 to ensure they were coordinated “like
moves in a game of chess” (Kang et al. 2020a). In 2021, the joint
WHO-China report dismissed all reported cases prior to December 8 as not COVID-19, and revived the theory that the virus
might have originated at the Huanan Seafood Market (WHO
2021).
In other outbreaks where direct identification of early cases

has been stymied, it has increasingly become possible to use genomic epidemiology to infer the timing and dynamics of spread
from analysis of viral sequences. For instance, analysis of SARSCoV-2 sequences has enabled reconstruction of the initial spread
of SARS-CoV-2 in North America and Europe (Bedford et al.
2020; Worobey et al. 2020; Deng et al. 2020; Fauver et al. 2020).
But in the case of Wuhan, genomic epidemiology has also
proven frustratingly inconclusive. Some of the problem is simply
limited data: despite the fact that Wuhan has advanced virology
labs, there is only patchy sampling of SARS-CoV-2 sequences
from the first months of the city’s explosive outbreak. Other than
a set of multiply sequenced samples collected in late December
of 2019 from a dozen patients connected to the Huanan Seafood
Market (WHO 2021), just a handful of Wuhan sequences are
available from before late January of 2020 (see analysis in this
study below). This paucity of sequences could be due in part to
an order that unauthorized Chinese labs destroy all coronavirus
samples from early in the outbreak, reportedly for “laboratory
biological safety” reasons (Pingui 2020).
However, the Wuhan sequences that are available have also
confounded phylogenetic analyses designed to infer the “progenitor” of SARS-CoV-2, which is the sequence from which all
other currently known sequences are descended (Kumar et al.
2021). Although there is debate about exactly how SARS-CoV-2
entered the human population, it is universally accepted that
the virus’s deep ancestors are bat coronaviruses (Lytras et al.
2021). But the earliest known SARS-CoV-2 sequences, which
are mostly derived from the Huanan Seafood Market, are notably more different from these bat coronaviruses than other
sequences collected at later dates outside Wuhan. As a result,
there is a direct conflict between the two major principles used to
infer an outbreak’s progenitor: namely that it should be among
the earliest sequences, and that it should be most closely related
to deeper ancestors (Pipes et al. 2021).
Here I take a step towards resolving these questions by identifying and recovering a deleted data set of partial SARS-CoV-2
sequences from outpatient samples collected early in the Wuhan
epidemic. Analysis of these new sequences in conjunction with
careful annotation of existing ones suggests that the early Wuhan

samples that have been the focus of most studies including the
joint WHO-China report (WHO 2021) are not fully representative of the viruses actually present in Wuhan at that time. These
insights help reconcile phylogenetic discrepancies, and suggest
two plausible progenitor sequences, one of which is identical to
that inferred by Kumar et al. (2021). Furthermore, the approach
taken here hints it may be possible to advance understanding
of SARS-CoV-2’s origins or early spread even without further
on-the-ground studies, such as by more deeply probing data
archived by the NIH and other entities.

Identification of a SARS-CoV-2 deep sequencing data set that
has been removed from the Sequence Read Archive

During the course of my research, I read a paper by Farkas et al.
(2020) that analyzed SARS-CoV-2 deep sequencing data from the
Sequence Read Archive (SRA), which is a repository maintained
by the NIH’s National Center for Biotechnology Information.
The first supplementary table of Farkas et al. (2020) lists all SARSCoV-2 deep sequencing data available from the SRA as of March
30, 2020.
The majority of entries in this table refer to a project (BioProject PRJNA612766) by Wuhan University that is described
as nanopore sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 amplicons. The table
indicates this project represents 241 of the 282 SARS-CoV-2 sequencing run accessions in the SRA as of March, 30, 2020. Because I had never encountered any other mention of this project,
I performed a Google search for “PRJNA612766,” and found no
search hits other than the supplementary table itself. Searching
for “PRJNA612766” in the NCBI’s SRA search box returned a
message of “No items found.” I then searched for individual
sequencing run accessions from the project in the NCBI’s SRA
search box. These searches returned messages indicating that
the sequencing runs had been removed (Figure 1).
The SRA is designed as a permanent archive of deep sequencing data. The SRA documentation states that after a sequencing
run is uploaded, “neither its files can be replaced nor filenames
can be changed,” and that data can only be deleted by e-mailing
SRA staff (SRA 2021). An example of this process from another
study is in Figure 2, which shows an e-mail by the lead author of
a paper on pangolin coronaviruses (Xiao et al. 2020) requesting
deletion of two sequencing runs. Subsequent to March 30, 2020,
a similar e-mail request must have been made to fully delete
SARS-CoV-2 deep sequencing project PRJNA612766.

The deleted data set contains sequencing of viral samples collected early in the Wuhan epidemic

The metadata in the first supplementary table of Farkas et al.
(2020) indicates that the samples in deleted project PRNJA612766
were collected by Aisu Fu and Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. Google searching for these terms revealed the samples
were related to a study posted as a pre-print on medRxiv in early
March of 2020 (Wang et al. 2020a), and subsequently published
in the journal Small in June of 2020 (Wang et al. 2020b).
The study describes an approach to diagnose infection with
SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses by nanopore sequencing. This approach involved reverse-transcription of total RNA
from swab samples, followed by PCR with specific primers to
generate amplicons covering portions of the viral genome. These
amplicons were then sequenced on an Oxford Nanopore GridION, and infection was diagnosed if the sequencing yielded
sufficient reads aligning to the viral genome. Importantly, the
study notes that this approach yields information about the
sequence of the virus as well enabling diagnosis of infection.
The pre-print (Wang et al. 2020a) says the approach was applied to “45 nasopharyngeal swab samples from outpatients with
suspected COVID-19 early in the epidemic.” The digital object
identifier (DOI) for the pre-print indicates that it was processed
by medRxiv on March 4, 2020, which is one day after China’s
State Council ordered that all papers related to COVID-19 must
be centrally approved (Kang et al. 2020a). The final published
manuscript (Wang et al. 2020b) from June of 2020 updated the description from “early in the epidemic” to “early in the epidemic
(January 2020).” Both the pre-print and published manuscript
say that 34 of the 45 early epidemic samples were positive in the
sequencing-based diagnostic approach. In addition, both state
that the approach was later applied to 16 additional samples
collected on February 11–12, 2020, from SARS-CoV-2 patients
hospitalized at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University.
There is complete concordance between the accessions for
project PRJNA612766 in the supplementary table of Farkas et al.
(2020) and the samples described by Wang et al. (2020a). There
are 89 accessions corresponding to the 45 early epidemic sam-

ples, with these samples named like wells in a 96-well plate (A1,
A2, etc). The number of accessions is approximately twice the
number of early epidemic samples because each sample has data
for two sequencing runtimes except one sample (B5) with just
one runtime. There are 31 accessions corresponding to the 16
samples collected in February from Renmin Hospital patients,
with these samples named R01, R02, etc. Again, all but one sample (R04) have data for two sequencing runtimes. In addition,
there are 7 accessions corresponding to positive and negative
controls, 2 accessions corresponding to other respiratory virus
samples, and 112 samples corresponding to plasmids used for
benchmarking of the approach. Together, these samples and
controls account for all 241 accessions listed for PRJNA612766
in the supplementary table of Farkas et al. (2020).
Neither the pre-print (Wang et al. 2020a) nor published
manuscript (Wang et al. 2020b) contain any correction or note
that indicates a scientific reason for deleting the study’s sequencing data from the SRA. I e-mailed both corresponding authors
of Wang et al. (2020a) to ask why they had deleted the deep
sequencing data and to request details on the collection dates of
the early outpatient samples, but received no reply.

by the SRA might not remove files stored on the cloud,
I interpolated the cloud URLs for the deleted accessions
and tested if they still yielded the SRA files. This strategy
was successful; for instance, as of June 3, 2021, going to
https://storage.googleapis.com/nih-sequence-read-archive/run
/SRR11313485/SRR11313485 downloads the SRA file for
accession SRR11313485. I have archived this file on the Wayback
Machine at https://web.archive.org/web/20210502130820/https:
//storage.googleapis.com/nih-sequence-read-archive/run/SRR11
313485/SRR11313485.
I automated this strategy to download the SRA files for 97
of the 99 sequencing runs corresponding to the 34 SARS-CoV2 positive early epidemic samples and the 16 hospital samples
from February (files for SRR11313490 and SRR11313499 were not
accessible via the cloud). I used the SRA Toolkit to get the object
timestamp (vdb-dump --obj_timestamp) and time (vdb-dump
--info) for each SRA file. For all files, the object timestamp is
February 15, 2020, and the time is March 16, 2020. Although the
SRA Toolkit does not clearly document these two properties, my
guess is that the object timestamp may refer to when the SRA
file was created from a FASTQ file uploaded to the SRA, and the
time may refer to when the accession was made public.

Recovery of deleted sequencing data from the Google Cloud

As indicated in Figure 1, none of the deleted sequencing runs
could be accessed through the SRA’s web interface. In addition,
none of the runs could be accessed using the command-line
tools of the SRA Toolkit. For instance, running fastq-dump
SRR11313485 or vdb-dump SRR11313485 returned the message
“err: query unauthorized while resolving query within virtual
file system module - failed to resolve accession ’SRR11313485’“.
However, the SRA has begun storing all data on
the Google and Amazon clouds.
While inspecting the
SRA’s web interface for other sequencing accessions, I
noticed that SRA files are often available from links to
the cloud such as https://storage.googleapis.com/nihsequence-read-archive/run/<ACCESSION>/<ACCESSION>.
Based on the hypothesis that deletion of sequencing runs

fraction sites called (21570-29550)

The data are sufficient to determine the viral sequence from
the start of spike through the end of ORF10 for some samples

Wang et al. (2020a) sequenced PCR amplicons covering nucleotide sites 21,563 to 29,674 of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which
spans from the start of the spike gene to the end of ORF10. They
also sequenced a short amplicon generated by nested PCR that
covered a fragment of ORF1ab spanning sites ∼15,080 to 15,550.
In this paper, I only analyze the region from spike through
ORF10 because this is a much longer contiguous sequence
and the amplicons were generated by conventional rather than
nested PCR. I slightly trimmed the region of interest to 21,570 to
29,550 because many samples had poor coverage at the termini.
I aligned the recovered deep sequencing data to the SARSCoV-2 genome using minimap2 (Li 2018), combining accessions

Figure 3 The reported collection dates of SARS-CoV-2 sequences in GISAID versus their relative mutational distances from the

RaTG13 bat coronavirus outgroup. Mutational distances are relative to the putative progenitor proCoV2 inferred by Kumar et al.
(2021). The plot shows sequences in GISAID collected no later than February 28, 2020. Sequences that the joint WHO-China report (WHO 2021) describes as being associated with the Wuhan Seafood Market are plotted with squares. Points are slightly jittered
on the y-axis. Go to https://jbloom.github.io/SARS-CoV-2_PRJNA612766/deltadist.html for an interactive version of this plot that enables toggling of the outgroup to RpYN06 and RmYN02, mouseovers to see details for each point including strain name and mutations relative to proCoV2, and adjustment of the y-axis jittering. Static versions of the plot with RpYN06 and RmYN02 outgroups
are in Figure S3.
for the same sample. Figure S1 shows the sequencing coverage for the 34 virus-positive early epidemic samples and the
16 hospitalized patient samples over the region of interest; a
comparable plot for the whole genome is in Figure S2.
I called the consensus viral sequence for each sample at each
site with coverage ≥3 and >80% of the reads concurring on the
nucleotide identity. With these criteria, 13 of the early outpatient
samples and 1 of the February hospitalized patient samples had
sufficient coverage to call the consensus sequence at >95% of the
sites in the region of interest (Table 1), and for the remainder of
this paper I focus on these high-coverage samples. Table 1 also
shows the mutations in each sample relative to proCoV2, which
is a putative progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 inferred by Kumar et al.
(2021) that differs from the widely using Wuhan-Hu-1 reference
sequence by three mutations (C8782T, C18060T, and T28144C).
Although requiring coverage of only ≥3 is relatively lenient,
Table 1 shows that all sites with mutations have coverage ≥10.
In addition, the mutations I called from the raw sequence data
in Table 1 concord with those mentioned in Wang et al. (2020b).
I also determined the consensus sequence of the plasmid control used by Wang et al. (2020a) from the recovered sequencing
data, and found that it had mutations C28144T and G28085T
relative to proCoV2, which means that in the region of interest
this control matches Wuhan-Hu-1 with the addition of G28085T.
Since none of the viral samples in Table 1 contain G28085T and
the samples that prove most relevant below also lack C28144T
(which is a frequent natural mutation among early Wuhan sequences), plasmid contamination did not afflict the viral samples
in the deleted sequencing project.
Analysis of existing SARS-CoV-2 sequences emphasizes the
perplexing discordance between collection date and distance
to bat coronavirus relatives

To contextualize the viral sequences recovered from the deleted
project, I first analyze early SARS-CoV-2 sequences already available in the GISAID database (Shu and McCauley 2017). The
analyses described in this section are not entirely novel, but syn4

thesize observations from multiple prior studies (Kumar et al.
2021; Pekar et al. 2021; Rambaut et al. 2020; Forster et al. 2020;
Pipes et al. 2021) to provide key background.
Known human SARS-CoV-2 sequences are consistent with
expansion from a single progenitor sequence (Kumar et al. 2021;
Pekar et al. 2021; Rambaut et al. 2020; Forster et al. 2020; Pipes
et al. 2021). However, attempts to infer this progenitor have
been confounded by a perplexing fact: the earliest reported
sequences from Wuhan are not the sequences most similar to
SARS-CoV-2’s bat coronavirus relatives (Pipes et al. 2021). This
fact is perplexing because although the proximal origin of SARSCoV-2 remains unclear (i.e., zoonosis versus lab accident), all
reasonable explanations agree that at a deeper level the SARSCoV-2 genome is derived from bat coronaviruses (Lytras et al.
2021). One would therefore expect the first reported SARSCoV-2 sequences to be the most similar to these bat coronavirus
relatives—but this is not the case.
This conundrum is illustrated in Figure 3, which plots the
collection date of SARS-CoV-2 sequences in GISAID versus the
relative number of mutational differences from RaTG13 (Zhou
et al. 2020b), which is the bat coronavirus with the highest fullgenome sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2. The earliest SARSCoV-2 sequences were collected in Wuhan in December, but
these sequences are more distant from RaTG13 than sequences
collected in January from other locations in China or even other
countries (Figure 3). The discrepancy is especially pronounced
for sequences from patients who had visited the Huanan Seafood
Market (WHO 2021). All sequences associated with this market differ from RaTG13 by at least three more mutations than
sequences subsequently collected at various other locations (Figure 3)—a fact that is difficult to reconcile with the idea that
the market was the original location of spread of a bat coronavirus into humans. Importantly, all these observations also
hold true if SARS-CoV-2 is compared to other related bat coronaviruses (Lytras et al. 2021) such as RpYN06 (Zhou et al. 2021) or
RmYN02 (Zhou et al. 2020a) rather than RaTG13 (Figure S3).
This conundrum can be visualized in a phylogenetic con-

Figure 4 Phylogenetic trees of SARS-CoV-2 sequences in GISAID with multiple observations among viruses collected before Febru-

rary, 2020. The trees are identical except they are rooted to make the progenitor each of the three sequences with highest identity to
the RaTG13 bat coronavirus outgroup. Nodes are shown as pie charts with areas proportional to the number of observations of that
sequence, and colored by where the viruses were collected. The mutations on each branch are labeled, with mutations towards the
nucleotide identity in the outgroup in purple. The labels at the top of each tree give the first known virus identical to each putative
progenitor, as well as mutations in that progenitor relative to proCoV2 (Kumar et al. 2021) and Wuhan-Hu-1. The monophyletic
group containing C28144T is collapsed into a node labeled “clade B” in concordance with the naming scheme of Rambaut et al.
(2020); this clade contains Wuhan-Hu-1. Figure S4 shows identical results are obtained if the outgroup is RpYN06 or RmYN02.
text by rooting a tree of early SARS-CoV-2 sequences so that
the progenitor sequence is closest to the bat coronavirus outgroup. If we limit the analysis to sequences with at least two
observations among strains collected no later than January 2020,
there are three ways to root the tree in this fashion since there
are three different sequences equally close to the outgroup (Figure 4, Figure S4). Importantly, none of these rootings place
any Huanan Seafood Market viruses (or other Wuhan viruses
from December 2019) in the progenitor node—and only one of
the rootings has any virus from Wuhan in the progenitor node
(in the leftmost tree in Figure 4, the progenitor node contains
Wuhan/0126-C13/2020, which was reportedly collected on January 26, 2020). Therefore, inferences about the progenitor of
SARS-CoV-2 based on comparison to related bat viruses are inconsistent with other evidence suggesting the progenitor is an
early virus from Wuhan (Pipes et al. 2021).
Several plausible explanations have been proposed for the
discordance of phylogenetic rooting with evidence that Wuhan
was the origin of the pandemic. Rambaut et al. (2020) suggest
that viruses from the clade labeled “B” in Figure 4 may just “happen” to have been sequenced first, but that other SARS-CoV-2

sequences are really more ancestral as implied by phylogenetic
rooting. Pipes et al. (2021) discuss the conundrum in detail, and
suggest that phylogenetic rooting could be incorrect due to technical reasons such as high divergence of the outgroup or unusual
mutational processes not captured in substitution models. Kumar et al. (2021) agree that phylogenetic rooting is problematic,
and circumvent this problem by using an alternative algorithm
to infer a progenitor for SARS-CoV-2 that they name proCoV2.
Notably, proCoV2 turns out to be identical to one of the putative progenitors yielded by my approach in Figure 4 of simply
placing the root at the nodes closest to the outgroup. However,
neither the sophisticated algorithm of Kumar et al. (2021) nor my
more simplistic approach explain why the progenitor should be
so different from the earliest sequences reported from Wuhan.
Before moving to the next section, I will also briefly address
two less plausible explanations for the discordance between phylogenetic rooting and epidemiological data that have gained traction in discussion of SARS-CoV-2’s origins. The first explanation,
which has circulated on social media, suggests that the RaTG13
sequence might be faked in a way that confounds phylogenetic
inference of SARS-CoV-2’s progenitor. But although there are un5

usual aspects of RaTG13’s primary sequencing data (Singla et al.
2020; Rahalkar and Bahulikar 2020), the conundrum about inferring the progenitor holds for other outgroups such as RpYN06,
RmYN02, and more distant bat coronaviruses reported before
emergence of SARS-CoV-2 such as ZC45 (Tang et al. 2020). The
second explanation, which was proposed in a blog post by Garry
(2021) and amplified by a popular podcast (Racaniello et al. 2021),
is that there were multiple zoonoses from distinct markets, with
the Huanan Seafood Market being the source of viruses in clade
B, and some other market being the source of viruses that lack
the T8782C and C28144T mutations. However, inspection of Figure 4 shows that clade B is connected to viruses lacking T8782C
and C28144T by single mutational steps via other human isolates, so this explanation requires not only positing two markets
with two progenitors differing by just two mutations, but also
the exceedingly improbable evolution of one of these progenitors
towards the other after it had jumped to humans.
Sequences recovered from the deleted project and better annotation of Wuhan-derived viruses help reconcile inferences
about SARS-CoV-2’s progenitor

To examine if the sequences recovered from the deleted data set
help resolve the conundrum described in the previous section, I
repeated the analyses including those sequences. In the process,
I noted another salient fact: four GISAID sequences collected
in Guangdong that fall in a putative progenitor node are from
two different clusters of patients who traveled to Wuhan in late
December of 2019 and developed symptoms before or on the
day that they returned to Guangdong, where their viruses were
ultimately sequenced (Chan et al. 2020; Kang et al. 2020b). Since
these patients were clearly infected in Wuhan even though they
were sequenced in Guangdong, I annotated them separately
from both the other Wuhan and other China sequences.
Repeating the analysis of the previous section with these
changes shows that several sequences from the deleted project
and all sequences from patients infected in Wuhan but sequenced in Guangdong are more similar to the bat coronavirus
outgroup than sequences from the Huanan Seafood Market (Figure 5). This fact suggests that the market sequences, which
are the primary focus of the genomic epidemiology in the joint
WHO-China report (WHO 2021), are not representative of the
viruses that were circulating in Wuhan in late December of 2019
and early January of 2020.
Furthermore, it is immediately apparent that the discrepancy
between outgroup rooting and the evidence that Wuhan was
the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is alleviated by adding the deleted sequences and annotating Wuhan infections sequenced in Guangdong. The rooting of the middle tree in Figure 6 is now highly
plausible, as half its progenitor node is derived from early
Wuhan infections, which is more than any other equivalently
large node. The first known sequence identical to this putative progenitor (Guangdong/HKU-SZ-002/2020) is from a patient who developed symptoms on January 4 while visiting
Wuhan (Chan et al. 2020). This putative progenitor has three mutations towards the bat coronavirus outgroup relative to WuhanHu-1 (C8782T, T28144C, and C29095T), and two mutations relative to proCoV2 (T18060C away from the outgroup and C29095T
towards the outgroup). The leftmost tree in Figure 6, which has
a progenitor identical to proCoV2 (Kumar et al. 2021) also looks
plausible, with some weight from Wuhan sequences. However,
analysis of this rooting is limited by the fact that the defining
C18060T mutation is in a region not covered in the deleted se6

quences. The rightmost tree in Figure 6 looks less plausible,
as it has almost no weight from Wuhan and the first sequence
identical to its progenitor was not collected until January 24.
We can also qualitatively examine the three progenitor placements in Figure 6 using the principle employed by Worobey et al.
(2020) to help evaluate scenarios for emergence of SARS-CoV-2
in Europe and North America: namely that during a growing
outbreak, a progenitor is likely to give rise to multiple branching
lineages. This principle is especially likely to hold for the scenarios in Figure 6, since there are multiple individuals infected with
each putative progenitor sequence, implying multiple opportunities to transmit descendants with new mutations. Using this
qualitative principle, the middle scenario in Figure 6 seems most
plausible, the leftmost (proCoV2) scenario also seems plausible,
and the rightmost scenario seems less plausible. I acknowledge
these arguments are purely qualitative and lack the formal statistical analysis of Worobey et al. (2020)—but as discussed below,
there may be wisdom in qualitative reasoning when there are
valid concerns about the nature of the underlying data.

Discussion
I have identified and recovered a deleted set of partial SARSCoV-2 sequences from the early Wuhan epidemic. Analysis of
these sequences leads to several conclusions. First, the Huanan
Seafood Market sequences that were the focus of the joint WHOChina report (WHO 2021) are not representative of all SARSCoV-2 in Wuhan early in the epidemic. The deleted data as well

Figure 6 Phylogenetic trees like those in Figure 4 with the addition of the early Wuhan epidemic sequences from the deleted data

set, and Guangdong patients infected in Wuhan prior to January 5 annotated separately. Because the deleted sequences are partial,
they cannot all be placed unambiguously on the tree. Therefore, they are added to each compatible node proportional to the number of sequences already in that node. The deleted sequences with C28144T (clade B) or C29095T (putative progenitor in middle
tree) can be placed relatively unambiguously as defining mutations occur in the sequenced region, but those that lack either of these
mutations are compatible with a large number of nodes including the proCoV2 putative progenitor. Figure S4 demonstrates that the
results are identical if RpYN06 or RmYN02 is instead used as the outgroup.
as existing sequences from Wuhan-infected patients hospitalized in Guangdong show early Wuhan sequences often carried
the T29095C mutation and were less likely to carry T8782C /
C28144T than sequences in the joint WHO-China report (WHO
2021). Second, given current data, there are two plausible identities for the progenitor of all known SARS-CoV-2. One is proCoV2
described by Kumar et al. (2021), and the other is a sequence
that carries three mutations (C8782T, T28144C, and C29095T)
relative to Wuhan-Hu-1. Crucially, both putative progenitors are
three mutations closer to SARS-CoV-2’s bat coronavirus relatives
than sequences from the Huanan Seafood Market. Note also
that the progenitor of all known SARS-CoV-2 sequences could
still be downstream of the sequence that infected patient zero
depending on the transmission dynamics of the first infections.
The fact that such an informative data set was deleted has implications beyond those gleaned directly from the recovered
sequences. Samples from early outpatients in Wuhan are a
gold mine for anyone seeking to understand spread of the virus.
Even my analysis of the partial sequences is revealing, and it
clearly would have been more scientifically informative to fully
sequence the samples rather than surreptitiously delete the par-

tial sequences. There is no plausible scientific reason for the
deletion: the sequences are perfectly concordant with the samples described in Wang et al. (2020a,b), there are no corrections
to the paper, the paper states human subjects approval was obtained, and the sequencing shows no evidence of plasmid or
sample-to-sample contamination. It therefore seems likely the
sequences were deleted to obscure their existence. Particularly
in light of the directive that labs destroy early samples (Pingui
2020) and multiple orders requiring approval of publications
on COVID-19 (China CDC 2020; Kang et al. 2020a), this suggests a less than wholehearted effort to trace early spread of the
epidemic.
Another important implication is that genomic epidemiology
studies of early SARS-CoV-2 need to pay as much attention to
the provenance and annotation of the underlying sequences as
technical considerations. There has been substantial scientific
effort expended on topics such as phylogenetic rooting (Pipes
et al. 2021; Morel et al. 2021), novel algorithms (Kumar et al.
2021), and correction of sequencing errors (Turakhia et al. 2020).
Future studies should devote equal effort to going beyond the
annotations in GISAID to carefully trace the location of patient

infection and sample sequencing. The potential importance
of such work is revealed by the observation that many of the
sequences closest to SARS-CoV-2’s bat coronavirus relatives
are from early patients who were infected in Wuhan, but then
sequenced in and attributed to Guangdong.
There are several caveats to this study. Most obviously, the
sequences recovered from the deleted data set are partial and
lack full metadata. Therefore, it is impossible to unambiguously place them phylogenetically, or determine exactly when
they were collected. However, little can be done to mitigate
this caveat beyond my failed attempt to contact the corresponding authors of Wang et al. (2020a). It is also important to note
that my phylogenetic analyses use relatively simple methods
to draw qualitative conclusions without formal statistical testing. Further application of more advanced methods would be
a welcome advance. However, qualitative and visual analyses
do have advantages when the key questions relate more to the
underlying data than the sophistication of the inferences. Finally, both plausible putative progenitors require that an early
mutation to SARS-CoV-2 was a reversion towards the bat coronavirus outgroups (either C18060T or C29095T) on a branch that
subsequently gave rise to multiple distinct descendants. Such a
scenario can only be avoided by invoking recombination very
early in the pandemic, which is not entirely implausible for a
coronavirus (Boni et al. 2020). However, because the outgroups
have ∼4% nucleotide divergence from SARS-CoV-2, a mutation
towards the outgroup is also entirely possible. Of course, future
identification of additional early sequences could fully resolve
these questions.
More broadly, the approach taken here suggests it may be
possible to learn more about the origin or early spread of SARSCoV-2 even without an international investigation. Minimally,
it should be immediately possible for the NIH to determine the
date and purported reason for deletion of the data set analyzed
here, since the only way sequences can be deleted from the SRA
is by an e-mail request to SRA staff (SRA 2021). In addition, I
suggest it could be worthwhile to review e-mail records to identify other SRA deletions, which are already known to include
SRR11119760 and SRR11119761 (USRTK 2020). Importantly, SRA
deletions do not imply any malfeasance: there are legitimate
reasons for removing sequencing runs, and the SRA houses
>13-million runs making it infeasible for its staff to validate the
rationale for all requests. However, the current study suggests
that at least in one case, the trusting structures of science have
been abused to obscure sequences relevant to the early spread of
SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. A careful re-evaluation of other archived
forms of scientific communication, reporting, and data could
shed additional light on the early emergence of the virus.

Recovery of SRA files from deleted project PRJNA612766
I parsed the first supplementary table of Farkas et al. (2020) to extract the
accessions for sequencing runs for deleted SRA BioProject PRJNA612766.
By cross-referencing the samples described in this table to Wang et al.
(2020a,b), I identified the accessions corresponding to the 34 early outpatient samples who were positive, as well as the accessions corresponding
to the 16 hospitalized patient samples from February. Samples had
both 10 minute and 4 hour sequencing runtime accessions, which were
combined in the subsequent analysis. I also identified the samples corresponding to the high-copy plasmid controls to enable analysis of the
plasmid sequence to rule out contamination. The code used to parse the
Excel table is available as a Jupyter notebook at https://github.com/jbloom/
SARS-CoV-2_PRJNA612766/tree/main/manual_analyses/PRJNA612766.
I recovered the SRA files from the Google Cloud by using wget to
download files with from paths like https://storage.googleapis
.com/nih-sequence-read-archive/run/SRR11313485/SRR11313485.
Note that I cannot guarantee that these Google Cloud links will remain
active, as my analyses of other deleted SRA runs (beyond the scope
of this study) indicates that only sometimes are deleted SRA files
still available via the Google Cloud. For this reason, key runs have
been archived on the Wayback Machine as described above, and all
downloaded SRA files relevant to this study are included in the GitHub
repository. Note also that as described in this paper’s main text, two
SRA files could not be downloaded from the Google Cloud using the
aforementioned method, and so are not part of this study.
Alignment of recovered reads and calling of consensus sequences
The downloaded SRA files were converted to FASTQ files using
fasterq-dump from the SRA Toolkit. The FASTQ files were preprocessed with fastp (Chen et al. 2018) to trim reads and remove lowquality ones (the exact settings using in this pre-processing are specified
in the Snakemake file in the GitHub repository).
The reads in these FASTQ files were then aligned to a SARS-CoV-2
reference genome using minimap2 (Li 2018) with default settings. The
reference genome used for the entirety of this study is proCoV2 (Kumar et al. 2021), which was generated by making the following three
single-nucleotide changes to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference (ASM985889v2)
available on NCBI: C8782T, C18060T, and T28144C.
I processed the resulting alignments with samtools and pysam to
determine the coverage at each site by aligned nucleotides with a quality
score of at least 20. These coverage plots are in Figure S1 and Figure S2; the legends of these figures also link to interactive versions
of the plots that enable zooming and mouseovers to get statistics for
specific sites. I called the consensus sequence at a site if this coverage was ≥3 and >80% of the reads agreed on the identity. These consensus sequences over the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome are available
at https://github.com/jbloom/SARS-CoV-2_PRJNA612766/raw/main/result

since the sequencing approach of Wang et al. (2020a) only covers part of
the genome.
I only used the recovered consensus sequences in the downstream
analyses if it was possible to call the consensus identity at ≥95% of the
sites in the region of interest from site 21,570 to 29,550. These are the
sequences listed in Table 1, and as described in that table, all mutation
calls were at sites with coverage ≥10. These sequences in the region of
interest (21,570 to 29,550) are available at https://github.com/jbloom/SARS

Bat coronavirus outgroup sequences

For analyses that involved comparisons to SARS-CoV-2’s bat coronavirus relatives (Lytras et al. 2021), the bat coronavirus sequences were
manually downloaded from GISAID (Shu and McCauley 2017). The
sequences used were RaTG13 (Zhou et al. 2020b), RmYN02 (Zhou et al.
2020a), and RpYN06 (Zhou et al. 2021)—although the multiple sequence
alignment of these viruses to SARS-CoV-2 also contains PrC31 (Li et al.
2021), which was not used in the final analyses as it more diverged from
SARS-CoV-2 than the other three bat coronaviruses at a whole-genome
level. The GISAID accessions for these sequences are listed at
https://github.com/jbloom/SARS-CoV-2_PRJNA612766/blob/main/data/co
mparator_genomes_gisaid/accessions.txt, and a table acknowledging the
labs and authors is at https://github.com/jbloom/SARS-CoV-2_PRJNA61
2766/blob/main/data/comparator_genomes_gisaid/acknowledgments.csv.
Sites in SARS-CoV-2 were mapped to their corresponding nucleotide
identities in the bat coronavirus outgroups via a multiple sequence
alignment of proCoV2 to the bat coronaviruses generated using
mafft (Katoh and Standley 2013).
Curation and analysis of early SARS-CoV-2 sequences from GISAID

For the broader analyses of existing SARS-CoV-2 sequences,
I downloaded all sequences from collected prior to March
of 2020 from GISAID. The accessions of these sequences are
at
https://github.com/jbloom/SARS-CoV-2_PRJNA612766/blob/
main/data/gisaid_sequences_through_Feb2020/accessions.txt,
and a table acknowledging the labs and authors is at
https://github.com/jbloom/SARS-CoV-2_PRJNA612766/blob/main/d
ata/gisaid_sequences_through_Feb2020/acknowledgments.csv.
I then used mafft (Katoh and Standley 2013) to align these sequences
to the proCoV2 reference described above, stripped any sites that were
gapped relative to the reference, and filtered the sequences using the
following criteria:
• I removed any sequences collected after February 28, 2020.
• I removed any sequences that had ≥4 mutations within any 10nucleotide stretch, as such runs of mutations often indicate sequencing errors.
• I removed any sequence for which the alignment covered <90% of
the proCoV2 sequence.
• I removed any sequence with ≥15 mutations relative to the reference.
• I removed any sequence with ≥5,000 ambiguous nucleotides.
I then annotated the sequences using some additional information.
First, I annotated sequences based on the joint WHO-China report (WHO
2021) and also Zhu et al. (2020) to keep only one representative from
multiply sequenced patients, and to indicate which sequences were from
patients associated with the Huanan Seafood Market. My version of
these annotations is at https://github.com/jbloom/SARS-CoV-2_PRJNA61
2766/blob/main/data/WHO_China_Report_Dec2019_cases.yaml. Next, I
identified some sequences in the set that were clearly duplicates from the
same patient, and removed these. The annotations used to remove these
duplicates are at https://github.com/jbloom/SARS-CoV-2_PRJNA612766
/blob/main/data/seqs_to_exclude.yaml. Finally, I used information from
Chan et al. (2020) and Kang et al. (2020b) to identify patients who were
infected in Wuhan before January 5 of 2020, but ultimately sequenced in
Guangdong: these annotations are at https://github.com/jbloom/SARS-C
oV-2_PRJNA612766/blob/main/data/Wuhan_exports.yaml.
I next removed any of the handful of mutations noted by Turakhia
et al. (2020) to be lab artifacts that commonly afflict SARS-CoV-2 sequences. I also limited the analyses to the region of the genome that
spans from the start of the first coding region (ORF1ab) to the end of
the last (ORF10), because I noticed that some sequences had suspicious
patterns (such as many mutations or runs of mutations) near the termini
of the genome.
The plot in Figure 3 contains all of the GISAID sequences after this
filtering. The plot in Figure 5 shows the filtered GISAID sequences

collected before February of 2020 plus the 13 good coverage recovered
partial early outpatient sequences (Table 1), considering only the region
covered by the partial sequences (21,570 to 29,550).
Phylogenetic analyses
The phylogenetic trees were inferred using the GISAD sequences after the filtering and annotations described above, only considering
sequences with ≥95% coverage over the region of interest that were
collected before February of 2020. In addition, after generating this
sequence set I removed any sequence variants with a combination
of mutations that was not observed at least twice so the analysis
only includes multiply observed sequence variants. A file indicating the unique sequences used for the phylogenetic analysis, their
mutations relative to proCoV2, and other sequences in that cluster is
at https://github.com/jbloom/SARS-CoV-2_PRJNA612766/blob/main/resul
ts/phylogenetics/all_alignment.csv.
I then used IQ-Tree (Minh et al. 2020) to infer a maximum-likelihood
phylogenetic tree using a GTR nucleotide substitution model with empirical nucleotide frequencies, and collapsing zero-length branches to
potentially allow a multifurcating tree. The inference yielded the tree
topology and branch lengths shown in all figures in this study with
phylogenetic trees. I then rendered the images of the tree using ETE
3 (Huerta-Cepas et al. 2016), manually re-rooting the tree to place the
first (progenitor) node at each of the three nodes that have the highest
identity to the bat coronavirus outgroup. In these images, node sizes are
proportional to the number of sequences in that node, and are colored
in proportion to the location from which those sequences are derived.
As indicated in the legend to Figure 4, the node containing the monophyletic set of sequences with C28144T is collapsed into a single node in
the tree images.
For the trees in which I added the recovered sequences from the
deleted data set (Figure 6), the actual trees are exactly the same as
those inferred using the GISAID sequences above. The difference is that
the sequences from the deleted data set are then added to each node
with which they are compatible given their mutations in an amount
proportional to the size of the node, the logic being that a sequence is
more likely to fall into larger clusters.
