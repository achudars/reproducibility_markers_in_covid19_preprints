Abstract

40

Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the costliest disease affecting the cattle industry globally.

41

Despite decades of research, the pathophysiology of BRD is not yet fully understood. It is widely

42

believed that viruses predispose cattle to bacterial infection by causing direct damage to the

43

respiratory tract and interfering with the immune system, leading to bacterial pneumonia. BRD

44

remains a major challenge despite extensive vaccination against all major viral pathogens associated

45

with the disease. Orthomyxoviruses (Influenza C & D viruses), have recently been found to infect

46

cattle throughout the United States and are implicated to play a role in BRD. Here, we use the largest

47

cohort study to date to investigate the association of influenza viruses in cattle with BRD. Cattle

48

(n=599) from 3 locations were individually observed and scored for respiratory symptoms using the

49

McGuirk scoring system. Deep pharyngeal and mid-nasal swabs were collected from each animal

50

and were tested quantitatively for bovine viral diarrhea virus, bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine

51

respiratory syncytial virus, bovine coronavirus, influenza C virus (ICV) and influenza D virus (IDV)

52

by real-time PCR. Cattle that have higher viral loads of IDV and ICV also have greater numbers of

53

co-infecting viruses than controls. More strikingly, in BRD-symptomatic cattle, the geometric mean

54

of detectable IDV viral RNA was nearly 2 logs higher in co-infected animals (1.30x104) than those

55

singly infected with IDV (2.19x102). This is strong evidence that viral coinfections can lead to higher

56

replication of IDV. Our results strongly suggest that orthomyxoviruses may be significant

57

contributors to BRD.

Introduction

64

Despite decades of study and attempts at control and prevention, bovine respiratory disease

65

(BRD) remains a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and economic losses in the cattle industry

66

worldwide. BRD is a polymicrobial infection and it accounts for approximately 70–80% of the cattle

67

feedlot morbidity in the USA (1). Losses are estimated to be $23.60 per calf and they add up to an

68

annual loss of over one billion dollars to the US cattle industry alone (2). BRD also results in the use

69

of widespread therapeutics and antibiotics in feedlots, which increasingly raises public health

70

concerns of promoting antibiotic resistance (3, 4).

71

The pathophysiology of BRD involves complex interactions between host, pathogen,

72

environment, genetic and management factors. In feedlot cattle, BRD is initiated by viral infection

73

exacerbated by stress due to travel which is typically followed by secondary infection by commensal

74

bacteria (5). Viral infection can cause increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections by

75

immunosuppression or by inflammation causing damage to the epithelium of upper airways and

76

injuring lung parenchyma. Such damage facilitates the migration of bacterial pathogens and

77

colonization of the lower respiratory tract. If unresolved, continued BRD advances to lower airway

78

regions, eventually causing bronchopneumonia. Many viral pathogens have been implicated in BRD,

79

including bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), bovine respiratory

80

syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza 3 (PI-3), and more recently bovine coronavirus

81

(BCoV). In sum, more than a dozen pathogenic bacterial and viral agents have been implicated in

82

BRD establishment and progression, prompting the development of vaccines to aid in protecting

83

against infection with several of these organisms. However, vaccination and other prevention

84

strategies have failed to stop the disease and alleviate these losses in production. Both bacterial and

85

viral coinfections are common in BRD, so it can be difficult to directly implicate any one pathogen.

86

The latest additions to the list of BRD-associated viruses include a class of virus previously

87

unknown to infect cattle. Orthomyxoviruses enveloped viruses with segmented negative-sense

88

single-stranded RNA genomes, including seven genera, four of which are influenza viruses. Influenza

89

D virus (IDV) is the most recently discovered member of the family and it is well established that

90

cattle are the definitive host for IDV (6). IDV RNA has been found in nasal secretions from cattle

91

with respiratory disease throughout North America (2, 6-10), Europe (11-14), and East Asia (15, 16).

92

Although infection with IDV causes only mild respiratory disease in experimentally infected calves

93

(17-20), a retrospective metagenomic BRD case-control study analysis of a set of 100 calves

94

identified a positive correlation between the presence of IDV genomic RNA in nasal swabs and BRD

95

symptoms in cattle (9). Additional retrospective case-control studies of feedlot cattle in Canada (10),

96

the USA, and Mexico (2) have also found a higher prevalence of IDV in cattle with symptomatic

97

BRD compared with healthy controls from similar sample sizes (n=93 and n=116). However, it

98

remains unclear how the mild pathogenic effects of IDV infection would cause BRDC.

99

In 2016, a second orthomyxovirus, influenza C virus (ICV), was detected in cattle with BRD

100

in the midwestern USA (21, 22). ICV was previously unknown to infect cattle, and it is uncertain

101

how long ICV has existed in the cattle population. ICV has been identified in Alberta, Canada, and

102

Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Colorado, Montana, Nebraska, Minnesota and Kansas, USA (10, 22).

103

Understanding the potential role of ICV in disease in cattle is in its infancy. ICV was first identified

104

in animals with BRD (21), suggesting that ICV may have an associative role in BRD. However, a

105

recent retrospect case-control metagenomics study of feedlot cattle respiratory tract samples found no

106

association between cattle with BRD and corresponding samples with reads mapping to ICV (10).

107

Additional exploration of the role of ICV in cattle health is needed to understand the significance of

108

this orthomyxovirus.

109

The potential association of these orthomyxoviruses with BRD could illuminate more about

110

BRD pathogenesis. Previous studies of IDV/ICV in case-control cattle have included limited sample

111

sizes and had mixed numbers of subjects from different premises. We hypothesized that exploring a

112

larger sample-size from individual premises would provide better clarity about IDV/ICV and

113

relationship to BRD by reducing the confounding variation contributed by differing management

114

practices and conditions at separate premises. Since cattle serve as a natural reservoir of IDV, the

115

mere presence of the virus may not correlate with disease. Hence, we believed that quantitative

116

evaluation of both health status and virus copy numbers could provide a robust statistical evaluation

117

of potential correlation of IDV or ICV with BRD. Here, probe-based real-time RT-PCRs were

118

utilized to screen for these viruses in deep nasal swabs from cattle. This technique provides the

119

ability to identify viral genomic RNA in a sensitive, specific and quantitative manner. Three separate

120

case-control cohorts of approximately 200 animals each were screened to retroactively determine the

121

prevalence of IDV and ICV in US cattle from 2011 to 2014, making this the largest case-control

122

investigation examining the relationship between these new orthomyxoviruses and BRD.

2.1 Subjects/scoring/sample collection.

125

All animal care and sample collections were approved and performed in accordance with the

126

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Washington State University (#04110). Cattle from

127

three locations were selected for the study. One study cohort (n=200) originated from calf-raising

128

operations in New Mexico state (23) consisting of female Holstein calves aged 23 to 76 days,

129

sampled from August to October 2011. The other two cohorts were from beef cattle feedlots (24).

130

One feedlot cohort (n=200) located in the state of Colorado consisted of male cattle, 98.5% Angus

131

and 1.5% Red Angus; animals were sampled between October to November 2012. The third cohort

132

(n=199) was from a beef cattle feedlot in Washington state with female cattle, 60.8% Angus, 14.1%

133

Charolais, 18.1% crossbred, 4.5% Red Angus, and 2.5% Hereford; 97% of animals were sampled

134

from January to July 2014, and 3% were sampled in October 2013. Each animal was individually

135

observed and scored for respiratory health symptoms using the McGuirk scoring system (McGuirk,

136

2008), with health scores ranging from 0 to 12. Animals with McGuirk health scores ≥5 were

137

classified as clinically affected BRD cases and those with scores ≤4 were classified as healthy

138

controls. One deep pharyngeal and one mid-nasal swab were collected from each animal and pooled

139

together in the viral transport medium.

140

2.2 Assay for viral agents.

141

One aliquot of each pooled swab sample was tested for BRSV, BoHV-1, BCoV, and BVDV

142

by the California Animal Health and Food Safety Lab System (Davis, CA) using real-time PCR or

143

RT-PCR. Viral nucleic acids were extracted from a separate aliquot of each nasal swab using the

144

MagMAX-96 Pathogen RNA/DNA kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. Nucleic acids were

145

tested for PI3, IDV, and ICV using real-time RT-PCR on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System

146

(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using previously reported primer and probe sets

147

(Supplemental Table A) (21, 25, 26) purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville,

148

Iowa). For PI3, 1 µL of the template was used in a 25 µL reaction using the QuantiFast Probe RT-

149

PCR Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) with 0.4 µM of each primer and 0.2 µM probe; cycling

150

conditions were: 50 °C for 20 min, 95 C for 5 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 62 °C for 30

151

s.

152

For IDV, 8 µL of template was used in a 25 µL reaction using the AgPath-ID One-Step RT-

153

PCR Reagents kit (Applied Biosystems) with 0.2 µM each primer and 0.06 µM probe; cycling

154

conditions were 45 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 64 °C for 45

155

s.

For ICV, 3 µL of template was used in a 20 µL reaction using the Path-ID Multiplex One-

157

Step RT-PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems) with 0.4 µM of each primer and 0.2 µM of each probe;

158

cycling conditions were 48 °C for 10 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60

159

°C for 45s.

160

2.3 Viral RNA Standards.

161

For IDV and ICV, standard curves of transcribed RNA template corresponding to each target

162

(IDV PB1 gene bases 1200 to 1600 and ICV M gene bases 545 to 1105) were generated. RNA was

163

transcribed from PCR products encoding the desired bases downstream of a T7 promoter region

164

using MEGAScript T7 Transcription Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) followed by purification using

165

the MEGAClear Transcription Clean-Up Kit (Invitrogen) and quantification using a NanoDrop lite

166

instrument (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). To generate standard curves, serial 10-fold dilutions

167

of transcription product ranging from 10-1 to 108 copies were included in triplicate in each real-time

168

RT-PCR assay. The limit of detection for the IDV assay was 1 copy (Ct value 38.5 to 40) and for

169

ICV it was 100 copies (Ct value 39 to 40). Three technical replicates of standards were used in all

170

real-time RT-PCR assays, as was a negative control of nuclease-free water. Unknown samples were

171

tested in duplicate. The coefficient of variance for all specimens (samples and standards) was Ct <

172

0.03.

173

2.4 Data analysis.

174

Statistical analyses were performed using Prism version 8 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).

175

Mann-Whitney U tests were performed to compare clinical health scores between state cohorts, with

176

two-tailed p values calculated. Viral copy numbers were determined by fitting Ct values to the

177

standard curves generated using transcribed RNA representing the target sequence of each RT-PCR.

178

The arithmetic mean values were calculated. To compare these lognormal-distributed viral copy data,

179

copy numbers were log transformed and a parametric t-test using Welch’s correction was performed.

180

In this analysis, one-tailed p values were calculated. Spearman correlations with two-tailed p-values

181

were performed to correlate clinical scores with viral copy number; percentages were compared via a

182

Fisher’s exact test.

183

3. Results

184

3.1 Orthomyxovirus prevalence in cattle.

185

IDV and ICV were detected in feedlot cattle from Colorado and Washington. However, no

186

IDV or ICV was detected in the cohort from Holstein calves from New Mexico. The prevalence of

187

IDV was similar in both feedlot cohorts (Colorado: 5.0%, Washington: 5.5%) (Table 1). The

188

Colorado cohort demonstrated a lower prevalence of IDV in BRD cases compared with controls

189

(cases: 3.0%, controls: 7.1%). The Washington cohort demonstrated a similar prevalence in control

190

and case animals (cases: 6.0%, controls: 5.1%).

191

Notably, ICV was identified in more animals than was IDV (Table 1). The prevalence of ICV

192

in the Colorado cohort overall was 15.5% and in the Washington cohort was 8.0%. ICV was detected

193

in 14.1% of BRD cases in Colorado and 16.8% of controls (45.2% of ICV-positive animals were

194

cases). In the Washington cohort, 3.0% of BRD cases and 13.1% of controls were ICV-positive, with

195

only 18.8% of ICV-positive animals having high clinical BRD scores.

196

3.2 Orthomyxovirus RNA copies in BRD case or control cattle.

197

Although the number of BRD case animals with detectable IDV RNA (n=9) was lower than

198

BRD controls (n=12), mean Ct values (range: control 21.82 to 37.09, case 19.70 to 34.96) and

199

corresponding log viral copy values were different between cases and controls. Viral copy numbers

200

were 0.75 logs higher in BRD case animals (Figure 1A). The trend toward mean viral copy numbers

201

being higher in BRD cases compared with controls approached statistical significance (p = 0.097)

202

and this trend was the same in the overall result, as well as in both of the herds independently

203

(Colorado: p=0.20; Washington: p=0.26). In addition, a significant positive correlation was found

204

between viral copy numbers and BRD score in the combined results (p=0.020) and in the Colorado

205

cohort (p=0.024) (Table 2).

206

BRD case and control animals positive for ICV RNA both demonstrated a range of detectable

207

Ct values (range: control 24.12 to 39.28, case 25.14 to 35.69) and copy numbers (Figure 1B). Similar

208

to IDV, despite a higher prevalence of ICV in control cattle, the BRD case cattle mean viral copy

209

levels were about 1 log greater, which was statistically significant in the combined cohort analysis

210

(p=0.0004). As shown in Table 3, a positive correlation was found between ICV viral copy number

211

and BRD score, which was statistically significant in the combined cohort data (Spearman r value =

212

0.44, p=0.0009) and in each cohort separately (Colorado p=0.022, Washington p=0.044), indicating

213

that animals showing more severe clinical symptoms had more viral RNA extracted from nasal

214

swabs.

215

3.3 Association of viral presence with BRD symptoms.

216

In addition to IDV and ICV, nasal swabs were screened for the five viruses most frequently

217

associated with BRD namely PI3, BoHV-1, BCoV, BVDV, and BRSV. To determine if there was an

218

association of viral presence and BRD symptoms, a Fisher’s exact test was used to evaluate the

219

significance of odds ratio values calculated between the presence of each virus and it is a BRD case

220

animal. The analysis showed that PI3, BoHV-1, BCoV, BRSV, and BVDV displayed odds ratios >1

221

(Table 4), suggesting an association of the presence of each of these viruses with BRD clinical

222

symptoms. Of these viruses, the odds ratios of BCoV and BRSV were statistically significant by

223

Fisher’s exact test (p=0.0007 and p=0.0008, respectively), and that of BoHV-1 approached

224

significance (p=0.061). In contrast, the odds ratio for IDV was 0.74, indicating no association with

225

BRD health status. For ICV, the odds ratio of the combined herds was 0.53, which approached

226

statistical significance (p=0.062), indicating a negative correlation between the presence of ICV and

227

the demonstration of BRD symptoms. Odds ratios of individual herds is provided in supplementary

228

material (supplementary tables 1&2).

229

3.4 Coinfections in BRD case and control animals.

230

Each cohort investigated presented particular characteristics regarding sex, age, breed, and

231

apparent association of viral infection with BRD clinical symptoms. While the cohort of female

232

Holstein calves from New Mexico had a significant relationship between the presence of any virus

233

and BRD symptoms (p=0.0027), animals in the feedlot cohorts, either male or female, demonstrated

234

a significant correlation between BRD symptoms and virus presence only when 2 or more viruses

235

were detected in the nasal swab sample (Colorado, male, p=0.0008; Washington, female, p=0.029).

236

However, when the association of viral infection with BRD case status was assessed without

237

counting the presence of ICV or IDV, the feedlot cattle cohorts demonstrated a significant positive

238

correlation when at least one virus was detected (Colorado, male, p=0.040; Washington, female,

239

p=0.0008; overall: p=0.0001). This finding further suggests no association between ICV or IDV and

240

BRD clinical symptoms in these populations.

241

Coinfection of ICV- or IDV-positive animals with other BRD-associated viruses occurred in

242

22.4% of the orthomyxovirus-positive animals (Table 5). The most common virus in coinfection was

243

BCoV (10 of the 15 coinfections). BVDV was found in coinfection in 6 of the coinfections. In the

244

single case of coinfection with ICV and IDV, levels of both viruses were near the lower limit of

245

detection (data not shown). ICV-positive BRD cases demonstrated a higher proportion of animals

246

with viral coinfection compared with ICV-positive control animals (p=0.0016 by Fisher’s exact test),

247

and a similar trend was observed in IDV-positive animals. In BRD case cattle, the geometric mean of

248

detectable IDV viral RNA levels was nearly 2 logs higher in co-infected animals (1.30x104) than

249

those only infected with IDV (2.19x102). However, ICV levels between these groups were similar to

250

one another.

4. Discussion

252

The disease of the respiratory tract in cattle is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in

253

the cattle industry in the US and around the world. Previous efforts to better understand the factors

254

contributing to BRD have included genomic SNP associations, sequencing efforts, bacterial and viral

255

associations, experimental infections with associated pathogens, as well as management

256

interventions. Here, we discuss how the data arising from the largest case-control investigation

257

examining the relationships among IDV, ICV, and BRD both support and dissent from this existing

258

literature. Limitations and strengths of the different approaches are noted and directions for future

259

research efforts are suggested.

260

Influenza D virus is relatively new, and it represents the first influenza virus to be closely

261

associated with cattle (6). Indeed, cattle appear to be the reservoir of this virus, and it is known to

262

have been present in North America since 2003 (27). ICV, which is primarily associated with disease

263

in swine and humans, was also recently identified in North American cattle with and without BRD

264

symptoms in the years 2015 to 2018 (10, 21). The results of this previous work provide reasonable

265

evidence that coinfections do influence the observed highly variable clinical outcomes of BRD. More

266

specifically, this literature provides strong evidence of higher morbidity and mortality in the event of

267

mixed viral and bacterial infections (28). Cattle experimentally coinfected with multiple BRD-

268

associated viruses consistently demonstrate more severe respiratory disease and prolonged viral

269

shedding (29-31). BRD cattle coinfected with IDV and other viruses have been reported ICV, and

270

one animal shedding IDV, ICV, BRSV, and BCoV (21). Ng et al. reported coinfection in six of seven

271

IDV-positive cattle. All six coinfections were with a virus that was significantly associated with BRD

272

in their analysis (9). In the cohorts utilized in the current study, the coinfection of IDV or ICV with

273

other BRD-associated viruses was more frequent in symptomatic (12 out of 26 IDV/ICV-positive)

274

versus asymptomatic (4 out of 42 IDV/ICV-positive) animals. The most common viruses found to be

275

in coinfections with IDV were BCoV and BVDV (each in three of the six coinfections). ICV positive

276

animals had coinfections with BCoV in seven of the nine cases and BVDV in three of nine

277

individuals. These results strongly suggest that these orthomyxoviruses may be significant

278

contributors to BRD by facilitating coinfections with other bovine pathogens. More strikingly, in

279

BRD-symptomatic cattle, the geometric mean of detectable IDV viral RNA levels were nearly 2 logs

280

higher in co-infected animals (1.30x104) than those only infected with IDV (2.19x102). This is strong

281

evidence that coinfection with other viruses can lead to higher replication of IDV.

282

Previous studies have examined potential correlations between IDV presence and BRD

283

symptoms and have found positive correlations with varying statistical significance. Ng et al.

284

examined Californian Holstein calves (July 2011-January 2012) ages 27-60 days (9). Here, the RT-

285

PCR method used did not include a quantitation control, so the limit of detection was unknown.

286

Samples were reported as positive with Ct values as high as 40.39 (range 27.84 – 40.39, median

287

33.85). A high odds ratio based on RT-PCR results from 50 subjects of each health status was found

288

to suggest a correlation between IDV infection and BRD symptoms, with 8 of 50 (16%) symptomatic

289

cattle showing IDV and 0 of 50 asymptomatic animals showing ICV. Direct comparisons between

290

the Ng et al. study and the current study are problematic since pathogen profiles of these 2 cohorts

291

were different (23). Indeed, more than half of the 100 BRD case calves and one-third of control

292

calves assayed in the current work had detectable BCoV (data not shown), but no BCoV RNA was

293

detected in the viral metagenomic screening of the California calf cohort (9). Differences in the

294

cohort makeup, as well as the herd management practices from these two populations may have

295

contributed to the lack of detection of IDV in the current calf cohort. These differing results reflect

296

the multifactorial nature of BRD.

297

Previous research often assayed pooled samples from different sites with variable

298

management practices. Zhang et al. showed there is a wide range of BRD-associated virus prevalence

299

associated with multiple feedlot locations (10). The current study is robust to this problem. Indeed,

300

the analysis of large sample sizes (n=100) from two specific sights led to the same conclusions

301

regarding the IDV and ICV correlations with BRD symptoms.

302

Mitra et al. used both metagenomics and real-time RT-PCR to detect IDV from steer at

303

feedlots in the US state of Kansas (4 lots, total 40 animals) and multiple Mexican states (6 lots, total

304

53 animals) in 2015. Cattle typically enter feedlots between 4 to 6 months of age in North America.

305

IDV was detected in one asymptomatic animal and 8 (29.6%) BRD case animals from Mexican

306

feedlots. Using an exclusive metagenomics approach, Zhang et al. found a similar result of a

307

significantly higher prevalence of IDV in samples from 58 case steer compared with 58 control steer

308

collected from multiple feedlots in Alberta, Canada, between November 2015 and January 2016.

309

However, in contrast to these findings supporting correlations between BRD and IDV, in the Kansas

310

feedlots, the opposite was observed: Mitra et al. found IDV in only 2 asymptomatic cattle. This result

311

is consistent with the current findings based on samples from nearly 400 individual animals from

312

IDV-positive populations. Here, among nearly 400 individual animals from 2 different US feedlots,

313

there was no significant evidence for higher IDV prevalence in BRD symptomatic cattle when

314

compared with BRD asymptomatic cattle. These different correlation results amongst studies may be

315

related to the vastly different scoring systems used to classify animals as case or control. The location

316

(country), management practices, sampling year, age, season, and sample sizes used may all

317

contribute to the between study correlational differences observed.

318

To date, only one other case-control study investigating both IDV and ICV in cattle has been

319

reported (10). This metagenomics study, described above, found no ICV in BRD case cattle but

320

identified several control animals with ICV. Their results agree with our finding of ICV in healthy

321

cattle, and a higher prevalence in control animals than in cases.

322

Although more prevalent in healthy cattle, in the current study ICV RNA levels were

323

significantly lower in BRD asymptomatic cattle, and IDV RNA levels showed a trend in this

324

direction, as well. This result is in agreement with previous observations of IDV RNA levels in sick

325

and healthy cattle (2, 32). The relative abundance of virus in each health status was not reported for

326

ICV in the only other cattle ICV case-control report (10). Taken together, these results suggest that

327

the level of orthomyxovirus infection may be of more relevance to BRD clinical symptoms rather

328

than the simple presence or absence of viral RNA. It is also possible that IDV- and ICV-positive

329

BRD control animals represent cattle with subclinical BRD. This prospect is consistent with the

330

identification of IDV in a pig with subclinical infection in the US (33) and the observation that IDV

331

causes only mild upper respiratory infection under experimental conditions (6, 17-20). Subclinical

332

BRD has been identified in feedlot cattle following slaughter based on lung lesion presence and was

333

associated with the presence of BoHV-1 in nasal-pharyngeal swabs (34). It is possible that IDV

334

could also contribute to lung damage, as there was evidence of deep respiratory tract disease in naïve

335

calves following experimental infection with IDV (18-20).

336

Unlike previous reports including several instances of coinfection of cattle with both ICV and

337

IDV (10, 21), only one such case was identified in the current study. Previous reports of ICV with

338

IDV coinfection were from samples obtained from 2014 and beyond, so this finding may be due to

339

different viral dynamics during this current study (2011 to 2014). Coinfection of cattle with IDV and

340

at least one other BRD-associated virus occurred in 55.6% of IDV-positive BRD case cattle in the

341

current study. This is similar to the 72.2% identified by Flynn et al using an RT-PCR method of IDV

342

identification (14).

343

Overall, a similar prevalence of RT-PCR-identified IDV and ICV was found in the BRD case

344

and control cattle in both orthomyxovirus-positive herds tested in this study. It has been suggested (9,

345

14, 17) that the main role of IDV in respiratory disease is contributing to effects initiated by infection

346

with other pathogens associated with respiratory disease in cattle. The results of this study provide

347

further evidence to support this hypothesis. The results here suggest that while neither IDV nor ICV

Page 14 of 22

348

causes BRD directly, these orthomyxoviruses are better able to replicate in cattle with another viral

349

respiratory infection and as such may contribute to illness in BRD. Increased replication of IDV or

350

ICV may contribute to BRD through tissue damage. Following experimental infection of calves, IDV

351

can be detected in samples of nasal swabs, tracheal swabs, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, as well

352

as in tissues including nasal turbinate, trachea, bronchus, and lung (17-20). Inflammation in the

353

trachea, as evidenced by neutrophil infiltration and mild epithelial attenuation, has been observed in

354

multiple studies of experimental IDV infection in cattle (17, 19, 20). To a lesser degree, lesions have

355

also been observed in lung tissue in some studies (18-20).

356

Besides physical tissue damage, the coinfection of the bovine respiratory tract with IDV

357

and/or ICV and another virus may affect the viral replication efficiency of all coinfecting viruses. For

358

example, in humans, infection by rhinovirus, the fastest-growing virus, reduces replication of the

359

remaining viruses during a coinfection, while parainfluenza virus, the slowest-growing virus is

360

suppressed in the presence of other viruses (35). Subsequently, the host is subject to the effects of the

361

prevailing virus.

362

An interesting alternative possible mechanism for IDV or ICV orthomyxoviruses to affect

363

BRD pathogenesis is through disruption of the bovine immune system. Viruses employ diverse

364

tactics to subvert the host immune responses. For example, influenza A viruses (IAVs) can

365

dysregulate innate immune antiviral responses in certain target cells, which promotes persistent IAV

366

circulation in asymptomatic reservoir hosts (36-38). Particularly because IDV can be found in

367

asymptomatic cattle, it is intriguing to consider if similar action is performed by this orthomyxovirus.

368

A recent study showed that IDV infection could lead to suppression of cytokine production in cattle.

369

In bronchioalveolar fluid collected two days after IDV infection, calves demonstrated upregulation of

370

two negative regulators of cytokine production (SOCS1 and SOCS3), and the proinflammatory type

371

one interferon pathway was decidedly unaffected (18). By suppressing immunity in the bovine

372

respiratory tract, IDV may promote an environment permissive to other viral infections, thus

373

promoting their establishment and facilitating the development of the disease. Delineation of the

374

mechanism of orthomyxovirus infection of cattle leading to BRD should focus on characterizing the

375

effects of IDV or ICV infection on bovine innate immunity.

376

Too often infections are studied in isolation when in reality there are most often multiple

377

infections that all interact with the host immune system and this amalgamation results in the

378

manifestation of the disease. As a consequence of this, the scientific community needs to embrace

379

this added complexity as it will be necessary to clearly understand not only the infection process but

380

also the manifestation of the disease. This approach should also inform the development of novel

381

intervention methods. Studying processes like virus community assembly and identifying rules of

382

the assembly could aid in the development of optimal and sustainable strategies for long term

383

management of both animal health and productivity. This may also lead to more efficient and

384

effective use of vaccines and antibiotics. The necessary factorial infection experiments needed to

385

disentangle the relative roles of all of these infectious agents would be laborious and expensive.

386

However, given the financial burden of BRD and subclinical BRD on nearly 100 million US cattle

387

and millions more around the world, the economics warrant the availability of funding to accomplish

388

this important animal health issue.
