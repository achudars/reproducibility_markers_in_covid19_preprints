ABSTRACT
Viral whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provides critical insight into the transmission and evolution of Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Long-read sequencing devices from Oxford
Nanopore Technologies (ONT) promise significant improvements in turnaround time, portability and cost,
compared to established short-read sequencing platforms for viral WGS (e.g., Illumina). However, adoption
of ONT sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance has been limited due to common concerns around
sequencing accuracy. To address this, we performed viral WGS with ONT and Illumina platforms on 157
matched SARS-CoV-2-positive patient specimens and synthetic RNA controls, enabling rigorous evaluation of
analytical performance. Despite the elevated error rates observed in ONT sequencing reads, highly accurate
consensus-level sequence determination was achieved, with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) detected at
>99% sensitivity and >99% precision above a minimum ~60-fold coverage depth, thereby ensuring suitability
for SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis. ONT sequencing also identified a surprising diversity of structural variation
within SARS-CoV-2 specimens that were supported by evidence from short-read sequencing on matched
samples. However, ONT sequencing failed to accurately detect short indels and variants at low read-count
frequencies. This systematic evaluation of analytical performance for SARS-CoV-2 WGS will facilitate
widespread adoption of ONT sequencing within local, national and international COVID-19 public health
initiatives.

INTRODUCTION
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative pathogen for COVID-19
disease1,2. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with a ~30 kb poly-adenylated
genome1,2. Complete genome sequences published in January 20201,3 enabled development of RT-PCR
assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection that have served as the diagnostic standard during the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic4.
Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 provides additional data to complement routine diagnostic
testing. Viral WGS informs public health responses by defining the phylogenetic structure of disease
outbreaks5. Integration with epidemiological data identifies transmission networks and can infer the origin
of unknown cases6-11. Largescale, longitudinal surveillance by viral WGS may also provide insights into virus
evolution, with important implications for vaccine development12-15.
WGS can be performed via PCR amplification or hybrid-capture of the reverse-transcribed SARS-CoV-2
genome sequence, followed by high-throughput sequencing. Short-read sequencing technologies (e.g.,
Illumina) enable accurate sequence determination and are the current standard for pathogen genomics.
However, long-read sequencing devices from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) offer an alternative with
several advantages. ONT devices are portable, cheap, require minimal supporting laboratory infrastructure
or technical expertise for sample preparation, and can be used to perform rapid sequencing analysis with
flexible scalability16.
The use of ONT devices for viral surveillance has been demonstrated during Ebola, Zika and other disease
outbreaks17-19. Although protocols for ONT sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 have been established and applied in
both research and public health settings20-22, adoption of the technology has been limited due to concerns
around its accuracy. ONT devices exhibit lower read-level sequencing accuracy than short-read platforms2325. This may have a disproportionate impact on SARS-CoV-2 analysis, due to the virus’ low mutation rate (8
´ 10-4 substitutions per site per year26), which ensures erroneous (false-positive) or undetected (falsenegative) genetic variants have a strong confounding effect.
In order to address concerns regarding ONT sequencing accuracy and evaluate its analytical validity for SARSCoV-2 genomics, we have performed amplicon-based nanopore and short-read WGS on matched SARS-CoV2-positive patient specimens and synthetic RNA controls, allowing rigorous evaluation of ONT performance
characteristics.

RESULTS
Analysis of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 controls
Synthetic DNA or RNA reference standards can be used to assess the accuracy and reproducibility of nextgeneration sequencing assays27. We first sequenced synthetic RNA controls that were generated by in vitro
transcription of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence. The controls matched the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain
at all positions, allowing analytical errors to be unambiguously identified. To mimic a real-world viral WGS
experiment, synthetic RNA was reverse-transcribed then amplified using multiplexed PCR of 98 ´ ~400 bp
amplicons that enabled evaluation of ~95% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Eight independent replicates were
sequenced on ONT PromethION and Illumina MiSeq instruments (see Methods).
We aligned the resulting reads to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome to assess sequencing accuracy and
related quality metrics (Fig. S1a-i). Illumina and ONT platforms exhibited distinct read-level error profiles,
with the latter characterised by an elevated rate of both substitution (23-fold) and insertion-deletion (indel)
errors (76-fold; Table 1; Fig. S1d,e). Per-base error frequency profiles showed clear correlation between ONT
replicates (substitution R2 = 0.67; indel R2 = 0.82; Fig. S1f,g). This indicates that ONT sequencing errors are
not entirely random but are influenced by local sequence context. For example, indel errors were enriched
(1.4-fold) at low-complexity sequences within the SARS-CoV-2 genome (i.e., sites with homopolymeric or
repetitive content; ~1% of the genome; Fig. S1d). Illumina error profiles showed weaker correlation between
replicates (substitution R2 = 0.15; indel R2 = 0.42), indicating that short-read sequencing errors were less
systematic than for ONT libraries (Fig. S1h,i).

Despite their distinct error profiles, both sequencing platforms demonstrated high consensus-level
sequencing accuracy across the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We used iVar and Medaka workflows to determine
consensus genome sequences for Illumina and ONT libraries, respectively (see Methods). We detected just
two erroneous variant candidates in a single ONT library (Table 1). Both of these were single-base insertions
occurring at low-complexity sites (Fig. S2), with no erroneous SNVs detected in any replicate (n = 8). All
Illumina libraries exhibited perfect accuracy (Table 1). Therefore, the sequencing artefacts affecting both
technologies had minimal impact on the accuracy of consensus-level sequence determination, with indel
errors in ONT samples being a possible exception.
Analysis of matched patient isolates
To further evaluate the suitability of ONT sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 genomics, we conducted rigorous
proficiency testing using bona fide clinical specimens. We performed ONT and Illumina WGS on matched, deidentified SARS-CoV-2-positive cases collected at public hospital laboratories in Eastern & Southern New
South Wales and Metropolitan Sydney from March-April 2020 (see Methods; Supplementary Table 1). The
SARS-CoV-2 genome was enriched by PCR amplification, using a custom set of 14 ´ ~2.5 kb amplicons that
covers 29783/29903 bp (99.6%) of the genome, including 100% of annotated protein-coding positions6.
Pooled amplicons then underwent parallel library preparation and sequencing on an ONT
GridION/PromethION and an Illumina MiSeq instrument (see Methods). Short-read sequencing was
performed according to a pathogen genomics accredited diagnostic workflow in a reference NSW Health
Pathology laboratory, enabling direct comparison of nanopore sequencing to the established standard for
pathogen genomics.
In total, we obtained complete (99.6%) genome coverage with both technologies for 157 matched positive
cases (Supplementary Table 1). By comparison to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain, Illumina sequencing
identified 7.6 consensus single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 0.04 indels, on average, per sample. A further
1.0 SNVs and 0.2 indels per sample were detected at sub-consensus read-count frequencies (20 – 80%),
indicative of intra-specimen genetic diversity (see below). Excluding positions with evidence of subconsensus variation, this provides an overall comparison set of 1201 consensus variants and 4,674,554
positions that match the reference strain in a given sample, against which to assess the accuracy of SARSCoV-2 nanopore sequencing (Supplementary Table 1).
We used each of two best-practice bioinformatics pipelines developed by the ARTIC network to identify
consensus variants with ONT sequencing data. The alternative pipelines differed primarily in their use of
either Medaka or Nanopolish to call variants (see Methods). In general, ONT variant candidates identified by
both pipelines were highly concordant with the Illumina comparison set. Illumina variants were detected
with 99.17% sensitivity and 99.58% precision by Nanopolish, compared to 98.33% sensitivity and 99.24%
precision by Medaka (Table 2). Undetected variants (false-negatives) were more frequent than erroneous
candidates (false-positives), occurring in 14/157 (9%) and 9/157 (6%) of Medaka samples, respectively
(Supplementary Table 2). Only 1/7 (14%) of consensus indels in the Illumina comparison set was detected
by either Nanopolish or Medaka, while a further five and nine false-positive indels were detected by the
respective pipelines (Supplementary Table 2). While the scarcity of consensus indels detected with either
sequencing technology prevented a more thorough evaluation of indel accuracy, this indicates that ONT is
inadequate for accurate detection of small indels in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. In contrast, SNVs were detected
by Nanopolish and Medaka with high accuracy: overall, we found 99.66% and 98.83% concordance between
ONT and Illumina SNVs, as measured by Jaccard similarity, with identical results in 145/157 (92%) and
153/157 samples (97%), respectively (Table 2).
Inspection of false-positive and false-negative variant candidates detected with ONT sequencing data
showed that these tended to occur in low-complexity sequences, which are known to be refractory to ONT
base-calling algorithms23. For example, false-negative and/or false-positive candidates were found within a
21 bp T-rich site in the orf1ab gene in multiple samples (Fig. S3a,b). We identified fifteen problematic lowcomplexity sites in the SARS-CoV-2 genome ranging in size from 9 to 42 bp in length that showed elevated
read-level sequencing error rates (Fig. S1d; Supplementary File 1). Exclusion of these positions (~1% of the
genome) improved the fidelity of ONT variant detection, with consensus SNVs in the Illumina comparison set
being detected with 99.83% and 99.40% sensitivity by Nanopolish and Medaka, respectively, and perfect

precision for both. Consensus SNVs detected with the Nanopolish workflow were identical between ONT and
Illumina data in 155/157 (99%) of samples (Table 2; Supplementary Table 3). This suggests that the accuracy
of nanopore WGS may be improved via the exclusion of a small number of ‘blacklist’ low-complexity sites in
the SARS-CoV-2 genome from downstream analysis.
We next assessed the impact of sequencing depth on ONT performance. To do so, we down-sampled
nanopore sequencing reads from a uniform 200-fold coverage across the SARS-CoV-2 genome and repeated
variant detection across a range of coverage depths (see Methods). Both sensitivity and precision of variant
detection were strongly influenced by sequencing coverage, showing a sharp decline below ~50-fold
coverage depth, with minimal improvement observed above ~60-fold (Fig. 1a,b). As above, excluding errorprone low-complexity sequences afforded consistent improvements to sensitivity and overall concordance
across the range of depths tested (Fig. 1a,b).
To verify these observations and assess reproducibility, we re-sequenced twelve specimens to generate
triplicate (n = 3) data on both Illumina and ONT platforms (see Methods). We measured reproducibility by
performing pairwise comparisons of detected variant candidates between replicates for a given sample
(Supplementary Table 4). No discordant variants were detected between Illumina replicates across any of
the 36 pairwise sample comparisons (309 variants total), confirming the reliability of short-read WGS. ONT
also showed high reproducibility, with 99.36% Jaccard similarity between Medaka replicates for consensus
variants (310 total) and perfect concordance for SNVs (Supplementary Table 4).
In summary, ONT sequencing enabled highly accurate and reproducible detection of consensus-level SNVs in
SARS-CoV-2 patient isolates but appears generally unsuitable for the detection of small indel variants.
Detection of intra-specimen variation
Within-host genetic diversity is a common feature of RNA viruses, with divergent quasi-species present in a
single infection. Within-host diversity may help infecting viruses evade the host immune response, adapt to
changing environments and can cause more severe and/or long-lasting disease28-30. Resolving this diversity
may also better inform studies of virus transmission than consensus-level phylogenetics alone31-33.
Therefore, we next evaluated the capacity of nanopore sequencing to identify intra-specimen genetic
variation by detecting variants present at sub-consensus frequencies (i.e. variants detected in < 80% of
mapped reads). Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 synthetic RNA controls (see above) showed that sequencing
artefacts in Illumina libraries could be misinterpreted as variants at read-count frequencies below ~20% (Fig.
S2b), effectively establishing a lower bound for variant detection. We therefore limited our analysis to
variants detected at ³20% frequency, taking variants detected by Illumina sequencing above this level to be
genuine. Overall, short-read sequencing identified sub-consensus variants (20-80%) in 54/157 samples,
comprising 156 SNVs and 20 indels (Supplementary Table 5).
Using Varscan2, we identified 154 sub-consensus SNV candidates in ONT sequencing libraries
(Supplementary Table 5). We detected 119 SNVs (sensitivity = 76.3%) in the Illumina comparison set and 25
false-positives (precision = 82.6%; Supplementary Table 5). Read-count frequencies for variants identified
with both technologies were correlated (R2 = 0.69), indicating that these were bona fide variants, rather than
sequencing artefacts (Fig. 1c). While the overall performance of sub-consensus SNV detection was quite
poor, most false-positives and false-negatives were confined to the lower end of the frequency range
assessed here (Fig. 1c,d). For example, SNVs at high (60-80%) and intermediate (40-60%) sub-consensus
frequencies were detected with relatively high sensitivity (95.7%, 91.3%) and precision (100%, 97.7%),
whereas low-frequency variants (20-40%) were detected with low sensitivity (63.2%) and precision (69.6%;
Fig. 1d). Unsurprisingly, the high rate of indel errors in ONT sequencing libraries meant that they were
unsuitable for detecting indel diversity, with errors overwhelming true variants (Supplementary Table 5).
In summary, ONT sequencing enabled detection of within-specimen SNVs at frequencies from ~40-80% with
adequate accuracy but was generally unsuitable for the detection of indels or rare SNVs (< 40%).
Detection of structural variation
Large genomic deletions or rearrangements can have a major impact on virus function and evolution,
however, there are currently just a few reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 specimens harbouring structural

variants (SVs)15,34 . Therefore, we next evaluated the detection of SVs in SARS-CoV-2 specimens with ONT
sequencing. We used NGMLR-Sniffles to identify potential SVs in ONT libraries and validated these with
supporting evidence from short-read sequencing (see Methods).
Across all SARS-CoV-2 patient specimens, we detected sixteen candidate deletions ranging in size from 151,840 bp (Table 3), while no other SV types were identified. Of these, 13/16 were supported by split shortread alignments and/or discordant read-pairs in matched Illumina libraries (Fig. S4a; Table 3). For 7/16
candidates, short-read evidence confirmed the presence of the deletion but indicated that the breakpoint
position was not accurately placed by ONT reads (Fig. S4b; Table 3). Among the thirteen deletions detected
by both platforms were examples in genes S, M, N, ORF3, ORF6, ORF8 and orf1ab (Table 3). Only one variant,
a 328 bp deletion in ORF8 (Fig. S4c), was detected in multiple specimens, although highly similar (but not
identical) 28 bp and 29 bp deletions were also detected in S in two unrelated specimens (Fig. S4d).
Overall, this analysis demonstrates that large deletions can be reliably detected using ONT sequencing and
suggests that structural variation in the SARS-CoV-2 genome is more common and diverse than currently
appreciated.

DISCUSSION
Viral WGS can be used to study the transmission and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, and is increasingly recognised
as a critical tool for public health responses to COVID-19. Nanopore sequencing offers an alternative to
established short-read platforms for viral WGS with several advantages. ONT devices: (i) are relatively
inexpensive, highly portable and require minimal associated laboratory infrastructure; (ii) enable rapid
generation of sequencing data and even real-time data analysis; (iii) require comparatively simple procedures
for library preparation and; (iv) offer flexibility in sample throughput, accommodating single (e.g., Flongle),
multiple (e.g., MinION/GridION) or tens/hundreds (e.g., PromethION) of specimens per flow-cell16,18.
Therefore, ONT sequencing could further empower SARS-CoV-2 surveillance initiatives by enabling point-ofcare WGS analysis and improved turnaround time for critical cases, particularly in isolated or poorly
resourced settings35.
Due to the relatively low mutation rate observed in SARS-CoV-226, accurate sequence determination is vital
to correctly define the phylogenetic structure of disease outbreaks. With ONT sequencing known to exhibit
higher read-level sequencing error rates than short-read technologies23-25, reasonable concerns exist about
suitability of the technology for SARS-CoV-2 genomics. Moreover, public databases for SARS-CoV-2 data (e.g.,
GISAID: https://www.gisaid.org/) already contain consensus genome sequences generated via ONT
sequencing, potentially confounding investigations that rely on these resources.
The present study resolves these concerns, demonstrating accurate consensus-level SARS-CoV-2 sequence
determination with ONT data. We report that: (i) variants at consensus-level read-count frequencies (80100%) were detected with >99% sensitivity and >99% precision across 157 SARS-CoV-2-positive specimens,
confirming the suitability of ONT sequencing for standard phylogenetic analyses; (ii) high accuracy and
reproducibly was achieved by each of two alternative tools for ONT variant detection, with Nanopolish
showing modest improvements over Medaka; (iii) a minimum ~60-fold sequencing depth was required to
ensure accurate detection of SNVs, but little or no improvement was achieved above this level; (iv) falsepositive and false-negative variants were typically observed at low-complexity sequences, with fidelity
improved by excluding these problematic sites; (v) in contrast to consensus SNVs, ONT sequencing performed
poorly in the detection of consensus indels or low-frequency variants (such variants should therefore be
interpreted with caution); (vi) while the high indel error rate in ONT sequencing impedes accurate detection
of small indels, long nanopore reads appear well-suited for the detection of large deletions and potentially
other structural variants. Although SNVs alone are sufficient for routine phylogenetic analysis, small indels
and large structural variants can profoundly impact gene function and are, therefore, of interest to studies
of virus evolution and pathogenicity15.
As the first systematic evaluation of nanopore sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 WGS, this study removes an
important barrier to its widespread adoption in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While short-read
sequencing platforms remain the gold-standard for high-throughput viral sequencing, the advantages to

portability, cost and turnaround-time afforded by nanopore sequencing imply that this emerging technology
can serve an important complementary role in local, national and international COVID-19 response
strategies.

MATERIALS & METHODS
Synthetic RNA controls
Synthetic controls used in this study were manufactured by Twist Biosciences and are commercially available
(Catalog item 101024). The controls comprise synthetic RNA generated by in vitro transcription (IVT) of the
SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence, representing the complete genome in 6 ´ ~5 kb continuous sequences. The
controls used in this study are identical in sequence to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference strain (MN908947.3),
allowing sequencing artefacts to be readily identified. Synthetic controls were prepared for sequencing via a
protocol established by the ARTIC network for viral surveillance (https://artic.network/ncov-2019). Briefly,
reverse-transcription was performed on aliquots of synthetic RNA (at 106 copies per µL) using Superscript IV
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) with both random hexamers and oligo-dT primers. Prepared cDNA was then
amplified using multiplexed PCR with 98 ´ ~400 bp amplicons tiling the SARS-CoV-2 genome (ARTIC V3 primer
set). Amplification was performed with Q5 Hotstart DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs) with 1.5 µL of
cDNA per reaction. PCR products were cleaned using AMPure XP beads (0.8X bead ratio), quantified using a
Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and partitioned into separate aliquots for analysis by short-read
and nanopore sequencing. We note that it is not possible to amplify the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome in this
way, since amplicons that span boundaries of the 6 ´ ~5 kb IVT products necessarily fail. Nevertheless, we
were able to evaluate ~95% of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence.
SARS-CoV-2 specimens
SARS-CoV-2-positive extracts from 157 cases, tested at NSW Health Pathology East Serology and Virology
Division (SaViD), were retrieved from storage and included in this study. All specimens were nasopharyngeal
swabs originating from patients in New South Wales during March-April 2020. Specimens underwent total
nucleic acid extraction using the Roche MagNA Pure DNA and total NA kit on an automated extraction
instrument (MagNA pure 96). Reverse-transcription was performed on viral RNA extracts using Superscript
IV VILO Master Mix (Thermo Fisher), which contains both random hexamers and oligo-dT primers. Prepared
cDNA was then amplified separately with each of 14 x ~2.5 kb amplicons tiling the SARS-CoV-2 genome, as
described elsewhere6. Amplification was performed with Platinum SuperFi Green PCR Mastermix (Thermo
Fisher) with 1.5 µL of cDNA per reaction. PCR products were cleaned using AMPure XP beads (0.8X bead
ratio), quantified using PicoGreen dsDNA Assay (Thermo Fisher). All 14 x amplicon products from a given
sample were then pooled at equal abundance and partitioned into separate aliquots for analysis by shortread and nanopore sequencing. This strategy ensured that any sequence artefacts potentially introduced
during reverse-transcription and/or PCR amplification were common to matched ONT/Illumina samples, so
would not be interpreted as false-positive/negatives during technology comparison.
Short-read sequencing
Pooled amplicons were prepped for short-read sequencing using the Illumina DNA Prep Kit, according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were multiplexed using Nextera DNA CD Indexes and sequenced on an
Illumina MiSeq. Within each sequencing lane, a blank sample was also prepared and sequenced, in order to
monitor for contamination and/or index swapping between samples. The resulting reads were aligned to the
Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome (MN908947.3) using bwa mem (0.7.12-r1039)36. Primer sequences were
trimmed from the termini of read alignments using iVar (1.0)37. Trimmed alignments were converted to
pileup format using samtools mpileup (v1.9)38, with anomalous read pairs retained (--count-orphans), base
alignment quality disabled (--no-BAQ) and all bases considered, regardless of PHRED quality (--min-BQ 0).
Variants were identified using bcftools call (v1.9)38, assuming a ploidy of 1 (--ploidy 1), then filtered for a
minimum read depth of 30 and minimum quality of 20. Variants were classified according to their read-count
frequencies as consensus (>80% reads supporting the variant) or sub-consensus (20-80%) variants, with the

latter further divided into high (60-80%), intermediate (40-60%) or low-frequency (20-40%). Variants at readcount frequencies below 20% were considered to be potentially spurious and excluded on this basis.
Nanopore sequencing
ARTIC amplicons (~400 bp) from the synthetic RNA controls were prepared for nanopore using the ONT
Native Barcoding Expansion kit (EXP-NBD104). The longer amplicons (~2.5 kb) used on SARS-CoV-2 patient
specimens were prepared for nanopore sequencing using the ONT Rapid Barcoding Kit (SQK-RBK004). Both
kits were used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Up to twelve samples were multiplexed on a FLOFLG001, FLO-MIN106D or FLO-PRO002 or flow-cell and sequenced on a GridION X5 or PromethION P24
device, respectively. In addition, a no-template negative control from the PCR amplification step was
prepared in parallel and sequenced on each flow-cell (Supplementary Table 6). The RAMPART software
package39 was used to monitor sequencing performance in real-time, with runs proceeding until a minimum
~200-fold coverage was achieved across all amplicons. At this point, the run was terminated and the flowcell washed using the ONT Flow Cell Wash kit (EXP-WSH003), allowing re-use in subsequent runs.
The resulting reads were basecalled using Guppy (4.0.14) and aligned to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome
(MN908947.3) using minimap2 (2.17-r941)40. The ARTIC tool align_trim was used to trim primer sequences
from the termini of read alignments and cap sequencing depth at a maximum of 400-fold coverage.
Consensus-level variant candidates were identified using each of two workflows developed by ARTIC
(https://github.com/artic-network/artic-ncov2019), using Nanopolish41 or Medaka (0.11.5) to variants,
respectively. Nanopolish variants candidates were filtered directly with the ARTIC artic_vcf_filter tool, while
Medaka candidates were evaluated by LongShot (0.4.1)42 before filtering. Sub-consensus level variant
candidates were identified using Varscan2 (v2.4.3)43.
Performance evaluation
For synthetic RNA controls, read-level quality metrics, such as sequencing error rates, were derived from
read alignments using pysamstats, with any bases that differed from the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence
considered errors.
The accuracy of variant detection by ONT sequencing was evaluated by comparison to the set of variants
identified by Illumina sequencing in matched cases. To ensure consistent representation of variants across
calls generated by different programs: (i) multi-allelic variant candidates were separate into individual
SNVs/indels using bcftools norm (1.9)38; (ii) multi-nucleotide variants were decomposed into their simplest
set of individual components using rtg-tools vcfdecompose (3.10.1) and; (iii) indels at simple repeats were
left-aligned using gatk LeftAlignAndTrimVariants (4.0.11.0). Variant candidates identified by Illumina/ONT
could then be considered concordant based on matching genome position, reference base and alternative
base/s. For a given case, variant candidates identified with ONT and Illumina were classified as true-positives
(TPs), candidates identified by ONT but not Illumina as false-positives (FPs) and candidates identified by
Illumina but not ONT as false-negatives (FNs). The following statistical definitions were used to evaluate
results:
Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN)
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
Jaccard similarity = TP / (TP + FP + FN)
Structural variation
To identify structural variation, nanopore reads were re-aligned to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome
(MN908947.3) using the rearrangement-aware aligner NGMLR (v0.2.7)44. Sniffles (v1.0.11)44 was then used
to detect candidate variants with a minimum length of 10 bp and ³ 20 supporting reads. To validate SVs
detected with ONT alignments, split short-read alignments and discordant read-pairs were extracted from
matched Illumina libraries using lumpy45. Variant candidates were then manually inspected to verify
evidence from ONT and short-reads and assess break-point position resolution.

Fig. 1. Variant detection performance for whole-genome ONT sequencing of SARS-CoV-2. (a; upper) Sensitivity with
which Illumina comparison SNVs at consensus-level variant frequencies (80-100%) were detected via ONT sequencing
on matched SARS-CoV-2 specimens (n = 157). Bars show mean ± range. (a; lower) Fraction of specimens tested in which
SNVs were detected with perfect sensitivity (sn). Data are plotted separately for genome-wide variant detection (gold)
and variant detection with error-prone ‘blacklist’ sites excluded (red). (b) Same as in a but Jaccard similarity (jac) scores
for all variant candidates are plotted instead of SNV sn. (c) Correlation of variant frequencies observed for SNV
candidates detected at sub-consensus frequencies (20-80%) with Illumina and ONT sequencing. Candidates detected
with ONT but not Illumina were considered to be false-positives (FP; red) and candidates detected with Illumina but not
ONT were considered to be false-negatives (FP; pink). (d) Sensitivity (blue) and precision (green) of SNV detection with
ONT sequencing at sub-consensus variant frequencies (20-80%). Data are plotted separately for high (60-80%),
intermediate (40-60%) and low (20-40%) frequencies. Error bars show 95% confidence intervals (Clopper-Pearson).
