Summary
A fraction of COVID-19 patients develop the most severe form, characterized by Acute
Respiratory Disease Syndrome (ARDS). The molecular mechanisms causing COVID-19induced ARDS have yet to be defined, though many studies have documented an increase in
cytokines known as a “cytokine storm." Here, we demonstrate that cytokines that activate the
NF-kappaB pathway can induce Activin A and its downstream marker, FLRG. In hospitalized
COVID-19 patients elevated Activin A/FLRG at baseline were predictive of the most severe
longitudinal outcomes of COVID-19, including the need for mechanical ventilation, lack of
clinical improvement and all-cause mortality. Patients with Activin A/FLRG above the sample
median were 2.6/2.9 times more likely to die, relative to patients with levels below the sample
median, respectively. The study indicates high levels of Activin A and FLRG put patients at risk
of ARDS, and blockade of Activin A may be beneficial in treating COVID-19 patients
experiencing ARDS.

Introduction
In the setting of infection by the SARS-Cov2 virus, it was reported quite early that hospitalized
and ICU patients were producing a "cytokine storm" (Huang et al., 2020), including the
cytokines IL-1 and TNFa. Clinical studies have demonstrated that blockade of cytokine
signaling and steroid treatment are beneficial in improving outcomes in patients, however further
elucidation of downstream signaling pathways contributing to clinical sequelae is important to
benefit patients suffering the worst symptoms of Covid-19.
We had previously studied IL-1 and TNFa in the setting of skeletal muscle cachexia, where
these cytokines have been shown to induce skeletal muscle atrophy (Egerman and Glass, 2014;
Trendelenburg et al., 2012). In one of our prior studies, we learned that IL-1 and TNFa could
induce the production of Activin A in skeletal muscle, and that the Activin A itself induced
skeletal muscle atrophy. We felt this was relevant to COVID-19, because it had been reported
separately, back in 2012, that patients who had Acute Respiratory Disease Syndrome (ARDS),
had high levels of Activin A in their Bronchial Alveolar Lavage fluid (Apostolou et al., 2012),
and, in a preclinical model, this same group found Activin A to be sufficient to induce a
phenotype reminiscent of ARDS when over-expressed in the trachea via an Adenovirus
(Apostolou et al., 2012). A separate group followed up in 2019, on a distinct ARDS population,
and were able to show that Activin A and its downstream pathway marker, FLRG, were
upregulated in human serum (Kim et al., 2019).
In addition, the most severe symptoms associated with Covid-19 seem to be age-related; older
patients and those with particular co-morbidities, like COPD, are more likely to experience
ARDS and are at higher risk for mortality from the virus (Fang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020).
It's therefore of interest to determine molecular mechanisms which are themselves age-perturbed,
which might help to explain this correlation of aging with Covid19-induced mortality.
For these reasons, we were interested to study sera from COVID-19 patients, to determine if they
too had elevated levels of Activin A, and evidence of pathway elevation, correlated to FLRG
levels. In addition, another marker previously associated with ARDS, PAI-1, was also evaluated
as it is one of the parameters confirmed in the ARMA and ALVEOLI trials associated with
ARDS mortality (Bos et al., 2017; Calfee et al., 2015). We further sought to determine if the
levels of Activin A, FLRG and PAI- correlated to important disease markers of COVID-19, such

as disease severity, the requirement for supplemental oxygen, other signs of ARDS, and
mortality. On a mechanistic level, we were then interested to see if other COVID-19 relevant
cell types, including bronchial and pulmonary smooth muscle, similarly responded to
inflammatory cytokines induced by the Cytokine storm, to produce Activin A, and, if so, by
which signaling pathway.
We had performed a clinical trial on COVID-19 patients using a Regeneron anti-IL-6R antibody
(sarilumab) (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04315298). We evaluated sera from these patients

after randomization and prior to therapy, to determine baseline Activin A, FLRG and PAI-1
levels, and correlated these to baseline clinical and laboratory variables and important disease
outcomes.

Results
Activin A, FLRG, and PAI-1 are elevated in critical patients relative to severe patients or
healthy controls.
COVID-19 presents a full spectrum of disease severity, from asymptomatic, mild cold-like
symptoms, more disabling but ambulatory illness, to more severe illness requiring degrees of
hospitalization and ICU Care, including increasing levels of oxygen support or ventilation. In
order to evaluate the relationship between Activin pathway engagement and stages of severe
disease progression, we examined the levels of Activin A and its pathway marker FLRG in sera
from COVID-19 hospitalized pneumonia patients with varying disease severity. Baseline
samples were collected from individuals hospitalized requiring low to high supplemental oxygen
who were receiving standard of care and supportive therapies due to Sarilumab trial enrollment
early in the pandemic at US centers. These were collected following randomization and prior to
treatment. To contextualize levels in COVID-19 patients, age-matched sera from healthy
controls were also evaluated.
In a prior study, it was shown that Activin A can be found in the Bronchial Alveolar Lavage
fluid and in the sera of other, non COVID-19, ARDS patients (Apostolou et al., 2012). In a
preclinical model, it was further shown that, when over-expressed, Activin A was sufficient to
phenocopy ARDS (Apostolou et al., 2012). Therefore, we sought to determine if Activin A and
its pathway marker FLRG, are elevated in severe and ICU COVID-19 patients in comparison to
healthy controls. SARS-CoV2-infected sera was obtained from subjects in a clinical study, where
age-matched sera samples from healthy controls were purchased. Additionally, PAI-1 was
studied because it is involved in the coagulation pathway (Ahmed et al., 2020), so it seemed
reasonable to use it as an additional queried biomarker of interest in COVID due to its multiple
roles in inflammation, coagulation, as well as an Activin-response protein, to determine if there
was anything unique about the Activin A/FLRG pathway.

Baseline demographics of biomarker study population
Demographic and health characteristics of the COVID-19 patients studied are shown in Table 1.
From the overall study, which enrolled 1946 patients from 62 sites, the present analysis includes
a random subset of 312 COVID-19 patients from 49 sites in addition to 114 age-matched control

subjects. Patients in the critical disease stratum had higher percentage of patients admitted to the
ICU and receiving steroids or vasopressors compared to patients in the severe stratum (Table 1).

Activin A, FLRG, PAI-1 not affected by sarilumab treatment relative to placebo
Although the clinical data analysis focused on pre-treatment sera analysis, we tested for potential
pharmacodynamic effects of sarilumab on Activin A, FLRG, and PAI-1 that may confound
prediction of longitudinal outcomes. Due to sample limitations, only 182 patients’ (n=95
placebo, n=87 sarilumab 400mg) baseline samples were analyzed along with matching samples
at Day 4 (N=176; n=92 placebo, n=84 sarilumab 400mg) and/or Day 7 (N=143; n=59 placebo,
n=84 sarilumab 400mg). These data are only from patients in the Phase 3 study (Critical disease
severity). For Activin A, FLRG and PAI-1, there was no significant difference between
treatment arms at baseline and change from baseline at Day 4 or Day 7 (data not shown).
Activin A and FLRG are elevated in patients with greater disease severity
Differences were observed between three categories of disease severity (control subjects, severe
COVID-19 patients, critical COVID-19 patients) for Activin A, FLRG, and PAI-1 (Figure 1; p <
0.0001). Follow-up pairwise testing revealed significantly elevated Activin A in critical (ICU)
COVID-19 patients, as compared to severely affected non-ICU COVID-19 patients and control
subjects (p < 0.05/3); severe non-ICU COVID-19 patients and control subjects did not differ in
Activin A (p > 0.05/3), indicating that Activin A is a biomarker for the Critical, ICU-bound
patients. For FLRG, levels were significantly elevated with increased severity of disease;
control, Severe, and Critical (p < 0.05/3), indicating that this Activin A pathway marker can also
distinguish between the distinct disease categories. In contrast, for PAI-1, levels were not
statistically different between the two COVID-19 strata: Severe and Critical (p > 0.05/3).
However, both were significantly elevated compared to control subjects (p < 0.05/3). These data
demonstrate that Activin A and its pathway marker FLRG are upregulated in more severe
settings of COVID-19, where patients require treatment in the ICU. In contrast, PAI-1 was
elevated in both COVID-19 settings and did not distinguish between the severe and critical state.

Higher levels of Activin A & FLRG are associated with increased risk of death and greater
oxygen requirements at baseline
Since Activin A and FLRG levels were most highly elevated in ICU patients (Fig. 1) we were
further interested in examining the relationship between longitudinal outcomes with baseline
Activin A, FLRG, and PAI-1 in COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2 A-C). Baseline Activin A was lower
in patients who survived than in patients who died and was a significant predictor of all-cause
mortality (OR = 1.54 (1.22, 1.98), p = 0.0004). The same trend was observed for FLRG (OR =
1.69 (1.32, 2.18), p < 0.0001), which was also lower in patients who survived than in patients
who died, consistent with Activin A and FLRG as being part of the same pathway - FLRG is
induced by Activin A activation of Smad2/3 (Razanajaona et al., 2007). In contrast, baseline
PAI-1 was not predictive of mortality (OR = 1.19 (0.92, 1.55), p = 0.18).
Oxygenation status at baseline was stratified into three categories based on oxygen device type:
Low Flow, High Flow, and Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV). Individual subject data are
plotted in Figure 2 (D-F). Differences between these three groups were observed for Activin A
(p < 0.0001), FLRG (p < 0.0001), and PAI-1 (p = 0.0004). Activin A was lowest for patients on
Low Flow, higher for patients on High Flow, and highest for patients on IMV. However, Activin
A did not significantly differ between patients on High Flow and IMV (p > 0.05/3). The same
trend was observed for FLRG and all pairwise comparisons were significant (p < 0.05/3). PAI-1
was also elevated with increased oxygen requirements. However, PAI-1 levels were only
significantly different between patients on Low Flow and IMV (p < 0.05/3). These data indicate
that Activin A and its pathway marker, FLRG, correlate with need for higher oxygen levels, but
PAI-1 levels, which is generally elevated in COVID-19 patients relative to healthy subjects, are
not linked with the need for greater oxygen.
In addition to Activin A and FLRG, disease progression and clinical outcomes also were related
to supplemental oxygen requirements upon study enrollment (Table 2). Patients requiring
greater supplemental oxygen pre-treatment experienced more days with fever, tachypnea,
hypoxemia, and supplemental oxygen. Furthermore, elevated rates of mortality, lower rates of
clinical improvement, and lower rates of hospital discharge were observed in patients requiring
greater oxygen requirements.

Lower Activin A and FLRG are associated with Lower rates of Mortality and 1-point
improvement in Clinical score
We next assessed the effect of baseline Activin A, FLRG, and PAI-1 on clinical endpoints,
including all-cause mortality and clinical score improvement (³1 point), using Fine-Gray
subdistribution hazard models. Patients were median split into two groups (Low, High) for each
analyte (Activin A = 388.4 pg/mL, FLRG = 13531 pg/mL, PAI-1 = 17.7 ng/mL). Cumulative
incidence curves for both endpoints are displayed in Figure 3 and subdistribution hazard ratios
(sHR) are shown in Table 3.
COVID-19 patients with elevated Activin A were more likely to die than patients with low
Activin A (sHR = 2.61 (1.66, 4.11); p < 0.0001). A similar effect was observed for FLRG (sHR
= 2.89 (1.81, 4.60); p < 0.0001). However, no differences in mortality were observed based on a
median split of PAI-1 (sHR = 1.20 (0.76, 1.88); p = 0.44). At day 60 of the study, rates of
mortality were 17% (Low) and 38% (High) for Activin A, 16% (Low) and 39% (High) for
FLRG, and 27% (Low) and 31% (High) for PAI-1.
COVID-19 patients with elevated Activin A were less likely to achieve clinical score
improvement (³1 point) than patients with low Activin A (sHR = 0.55 (0.42, 0.73); p < 0.0001).
A similar effect was observed for FLRG (sHR = 0.42 (0.32, 0.56); p < 0.0001). However, no
differences in clinical improvement were observed based on a median split of PAI-1 (sHR = 0.91
(0.67, 1.24); p = 0.56). At day 29 of the study, rates of clinical score improvement (³1 point)
were 73% (Low) and 53% (High) for Activin A, 77% (Low) and 47% (High) for FLRG, and
63% (Low) and 59% (High) for PAI-1.
The clinical data established that Activin A and its pathway marker FLRG were elevated in the
most severe settings of Covid-19 and that high levels were predictive of the worst Covid19
outcomes; we therefore were interested in further investigating the relationship between the
cytokines elevated in the Covid19 “cytokine storm” and Activin A. We studied cell types of
particular interest given the pathology of Covid19 - bronchial and pulmonary smooth muscle
cells.

IL-1a and TNFa induce Activin A & FLRG in human bronchial/tracheal smooth muscle
cells, lung fibroblasts, and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells
We next sought to investigate cells that are relevant for COVID-19 and decided upon studying
bronchial/tracheal smooth muscle cells and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, to determine
if these produced Activin A in response to inflammatory cytokines. These cells seemed
especially relevant since the prior cited paper documented very high levels of Activin A in the
bronchial alveolar lavage fluid of ARDS patients (Apostolou et al., 2012). A third cell line that
we thought to test were bronchial fibroblasts. We included these because it has been shown that
COVID-19 is more severe in the aged, and those with pre-existing conditions such as COPD
(Fang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), and fibroblasts are more prevalent in these settings. These
cell types are vulnerable or culprit cell populations in numerous pulmonary diseases – for
example, they’re contributors to pulmonary remodeling and functional decline in chonic
inflammatory lung diseases. Thus human bronchial/tracheal smooth muscle cells (SMCs), lung
fibroblasts and pulmonary artery SMCs were treated with 10ng/ml IL-1a and TNFa for five
days (Fig. 4). We found that both IL-1a and TNFa stimulated Activin A production in
bronchial/tracheal SMC, pulmonary artery SMCs and lung fibroblasts and IL-1a had a more
potent effect on Activin A production in comparison to TNFa (Fig. 4B).
Dexamethasone, a corticosteroid used in wide range of conditions for its anti-inflammatory and
immunosuppressant effect, has been tested in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and found to have
benefits for critically ill patients. Here we also demonstrated that dexamethasone could reduce
Activin A levels induced by IL-1a and TNFa back to baseline in bronchial/tracheal, pulmonary
artery SMCs, and lung fibroblasts (Fig. 4). Although we used a higher dose (100uM) of
dexamethasone in our in vitro study than can be used in the clinic, it is clear that dexamethasone
at least is capable of inhibiting cytokine-induced induction of Activin A.
To see the effect of anti-Activin A, bronchial/tracheal and pulmonary artery SMC as well as lung
fibroblasts were treated with an anti-Activin A ab (REGN2477) at 100nM, prior to the treatment
with IL-1a or TNFa. Compared with the isotype control antibody (REGN1945), REGN2477
significantly reduced Activin A detection following treatment with IL-1a or TNFa, indicating
that the antibody binds Activin A.

IL-1a and TNFa induce Activin A via the IKK/NFkB pathway
We next wanted to further explore the mechanism by which inflammatory cytokines can induce
Activin A, in pulmonary artery and in bronchial smooth muscle cells, which are both relevant for
Covid19 pathology – since SARS-Cov2 prominently effects the lung and the blood vessels (Fig.
5). In particular, we wanted to dissect the role of signaling molecules IKK, p38 and JNK that are
induced in response to cytokine receptor activation.
(Fig. In each cell type, the inflammatory cytokines could increase the production of Activin A,
and this was blocked by inhibiting the IKK/NFkappaB pathway (Figs 5A and 5B). Inhibition of
p38 or JNK could partially inhibit Activin A production, but this was cell-context specific, and
not at all as complete as simply blocking IKK (Fig 5A-B). Furthermore, simultaneous inhibition
of IKK and p38 or IKK and JNK was not additive, since IKK inhibition was sufficient to almost
fully inhibit Activin A production (Figs. 5A-5B).
These results indicate that Activin A induction by IL1a and TNFa is mainly dependent on the
IKK/NF-kappaB pathway and can be partially inhibited by blocking p38 or JNK pathways.

Discussion
COVID-19 is a recent and potentially very serious disease; in the most severe settings it induces
Acute Respiratory Disease Syndrome (ARDS), which can lead to the need for mechanical
ventilation (Piroth et al., 2020). Severe cases of COVID-19 can also result in death; worldwide
mortality from the disease ranges from 1.5 – 15%, depending on the country and other clinical
risk factors. ARDS can be caused by a variety of other conditions, including sepsis (Confalonieri
et al., 2017; Fialkow et al., 2006). In a prior survey of non-Covid19 ARDS patients, it was noted
that there was a significant increase in levels of Activin A in the bronchial alveolar lavage fluid
relative to control levels (Apostolou et al., 2012); these same researchers demonstrated that
Activin A was sufficient to induce an ARDS-like phenotype in a pre-clinical model, by
delivering the gene intra-tracheally via an adenovirus (Apostolou et al., 2012). A follow-up to
this study was able to reproduce the prior finding, and demonstrated that Activin A and its
pathway marker, FLRG (follistatin-like related gene, also called FLSTL3), were demonstrably
elevated in the sera of non-Covid-19 ARDS patients (Kim et al., 2019). Such studies are clearly
needed, to establish reliable biomarkers the reproducibility of biomarkers for ARDS; what is

especially needed are biomarkers which predict disease severity so that clinicians can be alerted
to the need for stronger interventions.
When patients with severe ARDS from COVID-19 began to be studied it was reported early on
that these patients were experiencing a "cytokine storm", which included reports of many
inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1 and TNFa upregulated in the blood. Our group had
previously connected IL-1 and TNFa to the induction of Activin A, in a study of skeletal muscle
atrophy caused by these cytokines (Trendelenburg et al., 2012). We were interested in the
mechanism of inflammation-induced atrophy, since inflammatory cytokines are upregulated in
several settings of cachexia, including cancer cachexia, and the resultant loss of muscle is a
serious contributor to mortality (Fearon et al., 2012). In our prior study we found that blocking
Activin A could inhibit approximately 50% of the cytokine-induced muscle atrophy,
demonstrating also in that setting that Activin A had a causal role for the downstream effects of
inflammatory cytokines (Trendelenburg et al., 2012). In the lung ARDS study, it was also
shown that inhibiting the Activin A pathway with a receptor trap could block the ability of LPS
to induce ARDS (Apostolou et al., 2012), further strengthening the evidence that Activin A was
required to induce ARDS, at least in a preclinical model.
We therefore sought in the present study to determine if Activin A and its pathway marker,
FLRG, were upregulated in patients with COVID-19, and especially those who had ARDS, in
comparison to age-matched controls. In this study we found that both Activin A and FLRG were
upregulated quite significantly in ICU-bound Covid-19 patients - with some patients
experiencing more than 2-fold increases in Activin A, with a tail of subjects that experienced
increases as high as 8x above the normal median. Strikingly, Activin A levels were not
significantly increased in COVID-19 patients who had serious disease but did not require
invasive mechanical ventilation - the marker clearly distinguished the populations. Activin A
induces FLRG (follistatin-related gene, also known as follistatin-like 3) (Bartholin et al., 2001).
In contrast to Activin A, which is internalized - and thus may not be found in the blood at lower
levels of pathway activation - FLRG remains in the blood stream, where it inhibits Activin
function - thus it's a downstream marker of prior activation of the pathway. FLRG levels were
induced in the severe, non-ICU patients, but were even more elevated in the ICU patients,
especially those who were experiencing ARDS, as determined by their need for invasive

mechanical ventilation. Additionally, with FLRG, subjects with very high elevations were found
to be more likely to require invasive mechanical ventilation as well.
The action of Activin and FLRG is likely not to be independent, with a correlation of (Spearman
rho = 0.54, p < 0.0001) at baseline between the two analytes, providing statistical evidence that
they're likely within the same pathway, which has been demonstrated biologically (Bartholin et
al., 2001). In contrast, PAI-1, which is a marker of coagulation, is already elevated even in less
severely affected patients, and was not further elevated in the ICU patients. Therefore, the data
in this paper establishes that Activin A and FLRG levels distinguish those who go on to the most
serious form of the disease, as determined by the need for oxygen, and risk of dying from
COVID-19. In contrast, PAI-1 is a less reliable biomarker for the eventual need for oxygenation,
or the risk of mortality. Although the data does not itself provide evidence that elevated
Activin/FLRG are causative of morbidly and mortality, it does indicate that these are appropriate
targets for further analyses, and prior preclinical data was suggestive that Activin A may be
causative for ARDS (Apostolou et al., 2012). In the present analysis, baseline levels of Activin A
and FLRG (not PAI-1) predicted all-cause mortality both with and without inclusion of
covariates in the models. A one standard deviation difference in Activin A (+374.1 pg/mL) at
baseline resulted in a 54% increased likelihood of death and a one standard deviation difference
in FLRG (+9415 pg/mL) resulted in a 69% increased likelihood of death. In a complementary
analysis, patients with Activin A greater than the sample median (388.4 pg/mL) were 2.6 times
more likely to die than patients with lower levels. Patients with FLRG greater than the sample
median (13531 pg/mL) were 2.9 times more likely to die than patients with lower levels. These
effects remained consistent when treatment arm and other covariates were included in the
models.
Prior studies have shown that Activin A can cause fibrosis (Matsuse et al., 1996), which is seen
in ARDS lungs, perhaps this is one way in which Activin A contributes to the phenotype.
Further, activation of myostatin, a related ligand, was shown to block skeletal muscle
differentiation (Trendelenburg et al., 2009); however these TGFbeta superfamily molecules can
induce fibroblast proliferation (Ohga et al., 1996) – which is also suggestive of their possible role
in this clinical setting. In addition, a paper looking at age-associated changes in protein levels in
human plasma was recently published (Lehallier et al., 2019); when we analyzed Activin A
(InhbA.InhbB) and FLRG (FSTL3) using their publicly available data (https://twc-

stanford.shinyapps.io/aging_plasma_proteome/) , both were shown to be significantly
upregulated with age - this upregulation could lower the threshold for pathological upregulation
induced by inflammatory cytokines.
We were interested to explore the mechanism by which inflammatory cytokines induce Activin
A, and what the likely cell types were which might be responsible. Examination of cell lines
demonstrated that IL-1 could induce Activin A significantly in Bronchial Smooth muscle cells,
as well as pulmonary muscle cells. It also had this effect on lung fibroblasts, which might be
more prevalent in the aged, or those with pre-existing conditions, such as COPD. TNFa was a
less reliable inducer of Activin A infibroblast cell lines; we speculate that this may be due to
relative levels of IL-1 vs TNF receptors, rather than some intrinsic difference in the signaling
pathways - we note this because TNFa is fully capable of inducing Activin A in pulmonary and
bronchial smooth muscle cells - so there doesn't seem to be anything intrinsically different
between the two cytokines, just a cell-specific ability to respond. As to downstream mechanisms
responsible for the induction of Activin A, we distinguished between various signaling pathway
induced by IL-1 and TNF using cellular inhibitors of those pathways. Only the IKK inhibitor
was able to completely and consistenly block the induction of Activin A, as opposed to p38 or
Jnk inhibitors, which were less effective. IKK is upstream of NF-kappaB induction, so the data
demonstrates that Activin A is induced by this pathway.
The cellular differences in response to IL-1 vs TNF demonstrate that a cytokine-centric approach
is unlikely to be successful to treat a disease like COVID-19, where there are a large array of
cytokines induced. Many of these induced cytokines signal similarly, and therefore one cannot
hope to block the ultimate effect without going downstream in the signaling pathway. Thus, it is
of particular interest that Activin A is induced by the IKK/NF-kappaB pathway, in common to
IL-1 and TNF, and other inflammatory cytokines, and that Activin A is sufficient, at least in a
pre-clinical model to induce ARDS. Furthermore, since Activin A and its pathway marker,
FLRG, are unique in being associated with the most severe effects caused by COVID-19 (the
induction of ARDS, resulting in an inability to breathe, ultimately causing death), the strong
suggestion from this data is that it would be beneficial to COVID-19 patients suffering from
ARDS to be treated with an inhibitor of Activin A.
Of note, an antibody to Activin A was fully capable of blocking the measured Activin A levels
induced by inflammatory cytokines, giving further hope that such an antibody could be effective

in blocking the severe effects of COVID-19 in ICU patients. Indeed, in the previously published
preclinical setting, use of an Activin receptor trap was sufficient to ameliorate ARDS in an LPSinduced model of the syndrome (Apostolou et al., 2012).
Might there be negative consequences to using an anti-Activin A approach in ARDS patients?
One study did show that Activin A could inhibit viral production in a variety of virus-infected
cell lines (Eddowes et al., 2019). This seems to be a plausible evolutionary mechanism
explaining why Activin A might be induced by cytokines. Initial viral load does correlate with
disease severity (Fajnzylber et al., 2020). However, the cytokine storm often comes later in the
disease, indicating the cytokine storm is part of the immune response to the virus (Khadke et al.,
2020). The impression, therefore, is that these severely affected patients are not suffering directly
from the viral load, but instead from an over-reaction of the immune system - the later occurring
cytokine response, which in some patients over-induces Activin A. We therefore suggest it's
reasonable to try inhibiting Activin A or its induced pathway to treat COVID-19 patients who are
experiencing ARDS.

Methods
COVID-19 Samples and informed consent
Samples were collected from subjects who consented to participate in an adaptive, phase 2/3,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous (IV) sarilumab in adults
hospitalized with severe or critical COVID-19. In the phase 3 portion, patients with critical
COVID-19 were randomized to sarilumab 400 mg IV, sarilumab 200 mg IV, or placebo (Trial
registration number: NCT04315298). The protocol was developed by the sponsor (Regeneron
Pharmaceuticals Inc.). Data were collected by the study site investigators and analyzed by the
sponsors. The local institutional review board or ethics committee at each study center oversaw
trial conduct and documentation. All patients provided written informed consent before
participating in the trial.
Definition of clinical variables
Oxygen Device Type: High Flow O2 requirements include: Non-rebreather face mask, Highflow nasal cannula, Non-invasive ventilation. Low Flow O2 requirements include Nasal cannula,
simple face mask. All-cause mortality: Number of days from randomization to death. Clinical
Improvement: ≥1-point improvement in clinical status from baseline to Day 22 using the
Clinical Status Assessment (7-point ordinal scale) (Peterson, 2017): 1, death; 2, hospitalized,
requiring invasive mechanical ventilation membrane; 3, hospitalized, requiring non-invasive

ventilation or high-flow oxygen devices; 4, hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5,
hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen but requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19
related or otherwise); 6, hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen and no longer requiring
ongoing medical care; and 7, not hospitalized.
Reagents
Withaferin A (Cat # S8587), SB203580 (Cat # S1076), SP600125 (Cat # S1460) were acquired
from Selleckchem. Recombinant Human TNFa (Cat # 300-01A), IL1b (Cat # AF-200-01B),
IL1a (Cat #200-01A) were acquired from Peprotech.
Cell Culture
Cytokine and steroid treatments
Bronchial/Tracheal smooth muscle cell (BTSMC, ATCC, PCS-130-011), normal human lung
fibroblast (NHLF, Lonza, CC-2512), and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC, Lonza,
CC-2581) were seeded at 200,000 cells/well in twelve-well plates and cultured in media as
specified by manufacturers. To eliminate the influence of other factors, cells were washed once
and cultured with serum-free medium with 5% BSA overnight. To study the effect of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1a and TNFa on Activin A production and whether Dexamethasone
and anti-Activin A can rescue, cells were pretreated with 100µM dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich
Inc, #D2915), 100nM REGN1945 (isotype control) or 100nM REGN2477 (anti-Activin A) for
10 minutes, and then treated with or without 10ng/ml IL-1a (R&D Systems, #200-LA-CF) or
TNFa (R&D Systems, #210-TA-CF) for five days. Conditioned media were harvested and
diluted at 1:10, and ELISA (human/mouse/rat activin A Quantikine ELISA kit, R&D Systems,
#DAC00B) was performed to measure Activin A production according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
ELISAs
Activin A, FLRG, and PAI-1 ELISAs were carried out by using R&D Quantikine ELISA Kit
systems, DAC00B, DFLRG0, DSE100 respectively, according to manufacturer’s protocols.
Statistical analysis
Clinical study. Descriptive statistics grouped by disease severity and oxygenation requirements
are reported as median (interquartile range; IQR) for continuous variables and frequency
(percent; %) for categorical variables. Kruskal Wallis tests were used for continuous variables

across three or more groups and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for continuous variables
between two groups. Fisher’s exact tests were used for categorical variables. Kruskal Wallis
tests with follow-up Dunn pairwise comparisons (for significant omnibus results) were used to
test for differences in Activin A, FLRG, and PAI-1 by disease severity and oxygen requirements
at baseline. For longitudinal outcomes, including mortality and clinical score improvement (³1
point), logistic regression models were used with baseline Activin A, FLRG, and PAI-1
(standardized) as predictors, with and without inclusion of covariates. Fine-Gray subdistribution
hazard models were also generated for these longitudinal outcome variables with available timeto-event information. Subjects were split into Viral Load groupings (Low, High) based on a
median split of baseline values of each analyte individually. Subdistribution hazard ratios (sHR)
for High groups, relative to Low groups, were calculated with and without inclusion of
covariates. All-cause mortality and clinical score improvement time-to-event data were censored
to Day 60 and Day 29, respectively. Rates of incidence for each outcome during the study were
calculated at the censored timepoint.
Experiment 1. Within each treatment condition (Blank, TNFa, and IL-1a) and cell type
(Bronchial SMC, Lung Fibroblasts, Pulmonary Artery SMC), pairwise t-tests were used to
compare Activin A concentration after additional cotreatment of 100uM Dex, 100nM REGN,
and 100nm REGN2477 to no cotreatment (Blank).
Experiment 2. Within each main treatment condition (no cytokines, IL1a, TNFa) and cell type
(bronchial smooth muscle, pulmonary smooth muscle), Activin A induction for each cotreatment
was compared to DMSO cotreatment using pairwise t-tests.
A Type-I error rate of a = 0.05 was used as the threshold for statistical significance, with
Bonferroni adjustment for follow-up tests and multiple comparisons. Covariates for all indicated
analyses included age, sex, race, ethnicity, steroid use, duration of pneumonia prior to baseline,
BMI, diabetes, and hypertension. Treatment arm was included as a covariate in models
predicting longitudinal outcomes. The results were almost identical regardless of inclusion or
exclusion of covariates; therefore, unadjusted statistics are reported in the text. All statistical
analyses were performed using R version 3.6.1.

Note: The sample was median split for each analyte separately and subdistribution hazard ratios
(sHR) along with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for High relative to Low groupings.
sHR>1 indicates higher rates in subjects with elevated Activin A, FLRG, or PAI-1. sHR<1
indicates lower rates in subjects with elevated Activin A, FLRG, or PAI-1. The variables in the
adjusted models include age, sex, race, ethnicity, steroid use, duration of pneumonia prior to
baseline, BMI, diabetes, hypertension, and treatment arm as covariates. * per 1000 person-days,
** per 100 person-days. # 1 subject with missing longitudinal data in Low Activin A, FLRG, and
PAI-1 groups.
