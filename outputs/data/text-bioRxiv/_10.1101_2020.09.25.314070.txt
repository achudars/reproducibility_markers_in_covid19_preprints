Abstract

28

Following emergence in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 rapidly became pandemic and is presently

29

responsible for millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. There is

30

currently no approved vaccine to halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and only very few treatment

31

options are available to manage COVID-19 patients. For development of preclinical

32

countermeasures, reliable and well-characterized small animal disease models will be of

33

paramount importance. Here we show that intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 into Syrian

34

hamsters consistently caused moderate broncho-interstitial pneumonia, with high viral lung loads

35

and extensive virus shedding, but animals only displayed transient mild disease. We determined

36

the infectious dose 50 to be only five infectious particles, making the Syrian hamster a highly

37

susceptible model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neither hamster age nor sex had any impact on

38

the severity of disease or course of infection. Finally, prolonged viral persistence in interleukin 2

39

receptor gamma chain knockout hamsters revealed susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to adaptive

40

immune control. In conclusion, the Syrian hamster is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 making

41

it a very suitable infection model for COVID-19 countermeasure development.

Introduction

45

Since emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019, the virus has spread across the globe causing >31

46

million confirmed infections resulting in over 960,000 deaths. SARS-CoV-2 causes coronavirus

47

disease (COVID)-19, which is associated with a broad range of symptoms. These symptoms are

48

most commonly fever, dry cough and fatigue, but can also include myalgia, headache, loss of

49

taste or smell, sore throat, congestion, runny nose, nausea and diarrhea. The incubation period of

50

SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 2-14 days with 5-6 days being most common (1). While the majority

51

of infections are asymptomatic or present as mild to moderate cases, a small percentage of

52

patients will progress into acute respiratory disease with fatal outcome (2, 3). In the absence of a

53

licensed vaccine and only limited treatment options available, scientific and health care

54

communities continue their efforts to rapidly find effective countermeasures for SARS-CoV-2

55

infections. Aside from new drug or vaccine development, repurposing and ‘off-label’ use of

56

existing FDA-approved compounds is being heavily pursued, often omitting preclinical animal

57

studies before moving directly into humans (4-7).

58

Preclinical animal models are integral to evaluating countermeasures for infectious diseases such

59

as COVID-19. Non-human primate (NHP) COVID-19 models have been established, and

60

several Old-World monkey species have been shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2

61

infection. Infection in these animals results in a transient mild to moderate interstitial pneumonia,

62

rather than the severe clinical outcomes (8-10). Ferrets have also been shown to be susceptible to

63

SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting in mild disease with shedding from the upper respiratory tract.

64

Efficient transmission has been documented suggesting the ferret may be a valuable preclinical

65

model for transmission but not for severe disease (11, 12).

66

Development of small animal SARS-CoV-2 infection models was initially delayed, but recently

67

both mouse and hamsters COVID-19 models have been described (13-17). The mouse

68

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor has only low affinity for the SARS-CoV-2

69

spike protein leading to poor binding and entry (18, 19). Initially, mouse susceptibility to SARS-

70

CoV-2 infection was increased through transduction of the respiratory tract cells using

71

adenovirus vectors expressing human ACE2, which lead to development of non-lethal

72

pneumonia (20, 21). Several receptor transgenic mice have since been created, expressing human

73

ACE2 under tissue-specific promoters or the endogenous mouse ACE2 promoter (14, 22-24). All

74

of these mice are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in a range of clinical signs with

75

mild to fatal disease depending on the transgene. SARS-CoV-2 adaptation to mice has also been

76

attempted through either serial passaging or reverse genetics. So far this approach has sensitized

77

mice to infection, leading to very mild disease (13).

78

Syrian hamsters have been reported to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection developing

79

moderate interstitial pneumonia leading to transient mild to moderate disease (15, 17). However,

80

these studies have used varying doses of SARS-CoV-2 for inoculation, and the impact of age and

81

sex on infection and disease is unclear. Herein, we defined the Syrian hamster as a SARS-CoV-2

82

infection and disease model and refined further virologic and host parameters to increase the

83

value of this small animal model. First, we demonstrated high functional interaction of the

84

SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) with the hamster ACE2 receptor. Next, we

85

determined the SARS-CoV-2 dose causing infection in 50% of animals (ID50) following

86

intranasal infection, showing these animals to be highly susceptible to infection. We detailed the

87

progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also the effect of sex and age on SARS-CoV-2

88

infection in the model. Finally, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 infection of interleukin 2 receptor,

Materials and Methods

93

Biosafety and ethics. All work using live SARS-COV-2 was performed in BSL4 using standard

94

operating protocols approved by the Rocky Mountain Laboratories Institutional Biosafety

95

Committee. All animal work was approved by the Institutional animal Care and use Committee

96

and performed in strict accordance with the recommendations described in the Guide for the

97

Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health, the Office of Animal

98

Welfare, the United States Department of Agriculture in an association for Assessment and

Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-Accredited Facility. Animals were group housed in

100

HEPA-filtered cage systems enriched with nesting material. Commercial food and water were

101

available ad libitum.

102

Virus. SARS-CoV-2 isolate nCoV-WA1-2020 (MN985325.1) was kindly provided by CDC as

103

Vero passage 3 (25). The virus was propagated once in Vero E6 cells in DMEM (Sigma)

104

supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 1 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 50 U/ml

105

penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Gibco) (virus isolation medium). The used virus stock was

106

100% identical to the initial deposited Genbank sequence (MN985325.1) and no contaminants

107

were detected.

108

Cells. Vero E6 cells were maintained in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf

109

serum (Gibco), 1 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin

(Gibco). 293T and baby hamster kidney (BHK) were maintained in DMEM (Gibco)

111

supplemented with fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin and L-glutamine.

112

Plasmids. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein plasmids were previously described (18). Sequences from

113

SARS-CoV-1/Urbani spike (GenBank MN908947), SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (AY278741),

114

human ACE2 (GenBank Q9BYF1.2) and hamster ACE2 (GenBank: XP_005074266.1) were

115

codon optimized for humans and cloned into pcDNA3.1+.

116

Cell entry assay. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles were pseudotyped with different

117

wildtype or chimeric spike proteins or no spike in 293T cells as previously described (18). BHK

118

cells were transfected in 96-well format with 100 ng of host receptor plasmid, or no receptor and

119

subsequently infected with spike-pseudotyped VSV particles as previously described (18).

120

Approximately 18 hours later, luciferase was measured using the BrightGlo reagent (Promega),

121

following the manufacturer’s instructions.

122

Animal studies. Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), 6-8-weeks-of-age and >27-weeks-of-

123

age, males and females, were purchased from Envigo. IL2RG KO hamsters were generated with

124

CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting technique established in the hamster by Utah State

125

University as reported previously (26). Hamsters were anesthetized by inhalation of vaporized

126

isoflurane and inoculated via intranasal instillation with 50 µl of varying concentrations of

127

inoculum (1 to 1x105 tissue culture dose 50 (TCID50) dropped into each naris (25ul/naris) using a

128

pipette. Hamsters were weighed and monitored daily for signs of disease. Temperature

129

transponders (BMDS IPTT-300) were implanted subcutaneously under anesthesia just above the

130

shoulder blades in a subset of hamsters to monitor and record temperatures daily. Swabs (oral

131

and rectal) were taken at different days post-infection using polyester flock tipped swabs (Puritan

Medical Products). Animals were euthanized for necropsies at different timepoints to assess

133

disease.

134

Virus titration. Virus was quantified through end-point titrations performed in Vero E6 cells.

135

Tissue was homogenized in 1ml DMEM using a TissueLyzer (Qiagen) and centrifuged to

136

remove cellular debris (10 minutes at 8,000 rpm). Cells were inoculated with 10-fold serial

137

dilutions of clarified tissue homogenate or whole blood samples in 100 µl DMEM (Sigma-

138

Aldrich) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin and

139

50 µg/ml streptomycin. Cells were incubated for seven days and then scored for cytopathic effect

140

(CPE). The TCID50 was calculated via the Reed-Muench formula (27).

141

Viral genome load. qRT-PCR was performed on RNA extracted from blood and swabs using

142

QiaAmp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Tissues (≤ 30 mg)

143

were homogenized in RLT buffer and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen)

144

according to the manufacturer protocol. Viral genomic RNA (gRNA) was detected with a one-

145

step real-time RT-PCR assay (Quantifast, Qiagen) using primers and probes generated to target

146

either the SARS-CoV-2 E (28) or N gene (forward: 5’- AGAATGGAGAACGCAGTGGG;

147

reverse: 5’- TGAGAGCGGTGAACCAAGAC; probe: 5’-CGATCAAAACAACGTCGGCC

148

synthesized with 5’ 6-carboxyfluorescein, internal Zen quencher and 3’ Iowa black quencher);

149

all primers and probes were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). Dilutions of

150

RNA standards quantified by droplet digital PCR were run in parallel and used to calculate

151

gRNA copies with the E assay. The N-based assay used a standard curve synthesized as follows:

152

T7 in vitro transcription (ThermoFisher) of a synthetically produced N sequence (IDT) was used

153

to generate template RNA. RNA was quantified by 260nm absorbance to determine copy number

154

and a standard curve generated by serial dilution.

155

Histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered

156

formalin (with two changes) for a minimum of 7 days. Tissues were placed in cassettes and

157

processed with a Sakura VIP-6 Tissue Tek on a 12-hour automated schedule, using a graded

158

series of ethanol, xylene, and ParaPlast Extra. Embedded tissues are sectioned at 5um and dried

159

overnight at 42°C prior to staining. Specific anti-CoV immunoreactivity was detected using

160

GenScript U864YFA140-4/CB2093 NP-1 at a 1:1,000 dilution. The secondary antibody is an

161

anti-rabbit IgG polymer from Vector Laboratories ImPress VR. Tissues were then processed for

162

immunohistochemistry using the Discovery Ultra automated processor (Ventana Medical

163

Systems) with a ChromoMap DAB kit (Roche Tissue Diagnostics).

164

Statistical analyses. Statistical analysis was performed in Prism 8 (GraphPad). T-tests were used

165

to assess studies with 2 groups, ANOVA was used to analyze studies with >2 groups.

Results

168

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds to the Syrian hamster ACE2 receptor. To validate that

169

that SARS-CoV-2 can bind and then use as an entry receptor the Syrian hamster ACE2 receptor,

170

a VSV pseudotype assay was performed as previously published (18). Briefly, a chimeric SARS-

171

CoV-1 spike protein was generated with the RBD replaced with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (VSV-

172

SARS-CoV-2-RBD) (18). We transfected BHK cells that do not express ACE2 with expression

173

plasmids for either human or hamster ACE2, or empty vector as a negative control. Cells were

174

then infected with the VSV pseudotyped particles carrying either SARS-CoV-1 full-length spike

175

(VSV-SARS-CoV-1-RBD) or chimeric VSV-SARS-CoV-2-RBD. As anticipated, both VSV-

176

SARS-COV-1-RBD and VSV-SARS-CoV-2-RBD were unable to enter BKH cells, but entry

177

was rescued in transduced cells expressing the hamster or human ACE2. Interestingly, VSV-

178

SARS-CoV-2-RBD entry was increased compared to VSV-SARS-CoV-1-RBD, independent of

179

the ACE2 origin, which may indicate higher susceptibility of both hamsters and humans to

180

SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 (Fig. 1).

181

Syrian hamsters are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. To determine the level of

182

susceptibility of Syrian hamsters to SARS-CoV-2 infection, four groups of six hamsters aged 4-6

183

weeks were infected with limiting dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 to determine the ID50. Groups were

184

intranasally infected with a ten-fold serial dilution series of virus ranging from 103 to 100

185

TCID50, and infection course was monitored by signs of disease including weight and

186

temperature. Although no significant changes in temperature over the experimental period were

187

observed, weight loss between the animal groups directly correlated with the infectious dose

188

(Fig. 2A). Oral and rectal swabs were taken at 3 days post infection (dpi) and 5dpi to measure

189

differences in levels of viral gRNA between the different groups. Only one animal in the group

190

receiving the 1 TCID50 dose had detectable gRNA in the oral swabs and none in the rectal swab

191

(Fig. 2B), with only half the animals in this group being positive at 5dpi (Fig. 2C). Lungs were

192

harvested at 5dpi and gRNA and infectious titers were determined. Remarkably similar gRNA

193

levels were found across groups infected with 10 TCID50 or higher, only the 1 TCID50 group had

194

a significant reduction in gRNA levels (Fig. 2D). Infectious titers from the lungs of each dose

195

group had a similar pattern with high viral loads in all groups, except the 1 TCID50 group for

196

which no infectious virus was detected (Fig. 2E). Remarkably, this series of experiments shows

197

the ID50 in Syrian hamsters to be only 5 TCID50 when administered intranasally.

198

SARS-CoV-2 infection of Syrian hamsters results in broncho-interstitial pneumonia. To

199

characterize the extent of disease in this model, two groups of 10 Syrian hamsters aged 4-6

200

weeks were intranasally infected with either 500 ID50 (low dose; 103 TCID50) or 5x104 ID50 (high

201

dose; 105 TCID50) of SARS-CoV-2. Animals were monitored for clinical symptoms of disease

202

with the intent of euthanizing a subset of animals for analysis when early symptoms became

203

apparent. At 3dpi hamsters in both groups had lost weight on consecutive days (Fig. 3A) and

204

displayed slightly ruffled fur with minor changes in respiration pattern. Four animals from each

205

group were euthanized at this time (3dpi) for analysis. Lungs were examined for gross pathology

206

and all animals had lung lesions consisting of focal extensive areas of pulmonary edema and

207

consolidation with evidence of interstitial pneumonia characterized by a failure of the lungs to

208

collapse following removal. No gross pathology was observed in other tissues collected

209

including liver, spleen, kidney and brain. The remaining hamsters continued to lose weight until

210

5dpi with a maximum loss of <10% body weight (Fig. 3A); clinical signs remained similar until

211

5dpi. Three more animals from each group were euthanized at this time (5dpi). At necropsy, an

212

increase in both number and severity of lesions were observed in animals receiving the low dose,

213

but gross pathology was similar in appearance at 3dpi and 5dpi in animals receiving the high

214

dose. Following four consecutive days of weight gain (Fig. 3A) and improving clinical signs, the

215

remaining animals from each group were euthanized at 10dpi. Gross examination of the lungs at

216

10dpi showed a significant reduction in both lesion severity and congestion relative to lungs

217

taken earlier during disease progression. Despite the obvious development of respiratory disease

218

at earlier times post-infection, clinical signs were minimal at this stage (10dpi) with animals

219

having recovered weight (Fig. 3A). Oral and rectal swabs were collected at each time point to

220

monitor viral gRNA shedding. Shedding peaked in all swab types at 3dpi with a small decrease

221

at 5dpi before dropping significantly at 10dpi (Fig. 3B, C). Lungs were evaluated for both

222

SARS-CoV-2 gRNA and infectious titers. gRNA loads in the lungs were high with >1010

223

genome copies/gram (Fig. 3D), whereas gRNA loads in other organs were approximately 4-5

224

logs lower (Sup. Fig. 1). Lung infectious titers were 107 TCID50 per gram at 3dpi although this

225

had already decreased at 5dpi and was absent in all but one animal at 10dpi (Fig. 3E). Overall,

226

there was no significant difference between the groups infected with the low and high dose of

227

SARS-CoV-2, except for 10dpi where one animal remained positive.

228

Pathologically, changes associated with disease in the lower respiratory tract were noted in both

229

the trachea and lung regardless of the inoculation dose. The observed pathology had a more

230

distinct progression in the low (500 ID50) inoculation dose than the higher dosed group (5x104

231

ID50). Evidence of broncho-interstitial pneumonia was observed at all evaluated time points. At

232

3dpi, lesions were characterized by epithelial necrosis in the trachea and bronchioles, squamous

233

metaplasia of the mucosa in the trachea, bronchiolitis characterized by influx of neutrophils and

234

macrophages into the lamina propria and mild interstitial pneumonia with expansion of alveolar

235

septa by edema fluid, with few strands of fibrin and low numbers of leukocytes (Fig 4. A-C). By

236

5dpi, the interstitial pneumonia was moderate to severe with fibrin leaking into alveolar spaces,

237

alveolar edema, influx of moderate numbers to numerous neutrophils and macrophages into

238

alveolar spaces, presence of syncytial cells in bronchioles and alveolar spaces and prominent

239

type II pneumocyte hyperplasia (Fig. 4D-F). Evidence of lesion resolution was observed at 10dpi

240

with a decrease in alveolar cellular exudate, absence of epithelial necrosis and a prominent

241

“honeycombing” pattern of type II pneumocyte hyperplasia centered on terminal bronchioles

242

with septal expansion by a small to moderate amount of fibrosis (Fig. 4G-I). Mild and multifocal

243

pleural fibrosis was observed at 10dpi (Fig. 5). At both 5dpi and 10dpi, moderate numbers of

244

blood vessels were surrounded by perivascular infiltrates of lymphocytes that frequently formed

245

distinct perivascular cuffs, occasionally focally disrupting the tunica media or forming

aggregates between the tunica intima and media elevating the endothelium into the lumen.

247

Immunohistochemical reaction demonstrated viral antigen in bronchiole epithelial cells at 3dpi

248

(Fig. 5A-C) with fewer cells showing immunoreactivity at 5dpi (Fig. 5D-E) and no epithelial

249

cells exhibiting immunoreactivity at 10dpi (Fig. 5G-I). Lower in the respiratory tree, SARS-

250

CoV-2 immunoreactivity was demonstrated in type I and II pneumocytes as well as alveolar

251

macrophages at 3dpi and 5dpi with a lack of immunoreactivity at 10dpi (Fig. 5G-I). Overall,

252

pathologic changes progressed more rapidly in animals infected with the high dose relative to the

253

low dose, but severity of disease was consistent between the groups with all animals developing

254

moderate to severe broncho-interstitial pneumonia, commensurate with a mild to moderate

255

infection model.

256

Neither age nor gender affected disease severity or outcome. To determine whether age or

257

gender would affect disease progression following SARS-CoV-2 infection, we infected both

258

young (4-6 weeks old) and aged (>6 months old) male and female hamsters with the low dose of

259

500 ID50 (103 TCID50) by the intranasal route. Consistent with previous studies, animals began to

260

show mild clinical signs of disease and weight loss peaking at 5dpi or 6dpi (Fig. 6A). A subset of

261

animals in each age group and gender were euthanized for analysis at 3, 5 and 11dpi. Lung

262

pathology was comparable in all groups at each time point throughout the study. Gross lung

263

lesions were evident at 3dpi, had worsened by 5dpi before mostly resolving at 11dpi (Supp. Fig.

264

2A). To help determine disease severity, lung weights were recorded and calculated as a

265

percentage of overall body weight for comparison. Lungs weights paralleled the observed lesions

266

and were significantly increased at 5dpi (Supp. Fig. 2B). These observations were consistent

267

with the development of pneumonia and was independent of sex and age.

268

High levels of viral gRNA were detected in oral and rectal swabs in all groups. The highest

269

gRNA levels detected were 3dpi before decreasing at 5dpi and again at 11dpi where only a

270

subset remained positive (Fig. 6B, C). Interestingly, all oral swabs were positive at 11dpi

271

suggesting viral replication was still ongoing in the upper respiratory areas (Fig. 6B). Several

272

tissues including blood were collected and examined by qRT-PCR for viral gRNA loads at each

273

timepoint. The lungs had high viral loads with gRNA levels highest 3dpi before decreasing at

274

5dpi and again at 11dpi (Fig. 6D). This corresponded with infectious titers which followed a

275

similar pattern and peaked at 3dpi (Fig. 6E). The brain consistently had the second highest levels

276

of viral gRNA detected and remained relatively stable across the groups at >108 TCID50

277

equivalents at the time points examined. The digestive tract, both upper and lower, exhibited

278

levels of gRNA of >106 TCID50 equivalents across the study. Liver, spleen and kidneys all had

279

similar levels of gRNA at 3dpi and 5dpi with >104 TCID50 equivalents before decreasing at

280

11dpi.

281

Hamsters lacking interleukin-2 receptor subunit gamma (IL2RG KO) show persistent

282

infection with SARS-CoV-2. IL2RG KO hamsters are unable to develop mature NK cells with

283

compromised development of T and B lymphocytes (26, 29). This lack of mature lymphoid cells

284

results in an immunocompromised status known as X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency

285

(XSCID) in humans (30). To ask the question of whether these key cellular aspects of the innate

286

(NK) and adaptive (B and T cells) impact SARS-CoV-2 replication and associated disease, we

287

assessed infection in IL2RG KO hamsters. Similar to immunocompetent Syrian hamsters,

288

following infection with 5x104 ID50 (high dose; 105 TCID50) of SARS-CoV-2, four (2 males, 2

289

females) IL2RG KO hamsters lost approximately 5-10% of their body weight over the first 5

290

days following infection before recovering (Fig. 7A). Oral and rectal swabs were taken at 5dpi

291

and 24dpi to measure shedding. Interestingly, both oral and rectal swabs were positive at both

292

time-points and at very similar levels (Fig. 7B). All four hamsters were euthanized 24dpi

293

following 2 weeks of consistent weight gain and lungs were examined for disease. At

294

examination, the lungs had lesions similar to the immunocompetent hamsters at 5dpi, were

295

congested and failed to collapse. Remarkably, virus titration performed on lung tissue revealed

296

high infectious titers ranging from 107 - 109 TCID50 per gram of tissue, even at 24dpi (Fig. 7C).

297

Histopathologic analysis of the lung sections of all evaluated IL2RG KO hamsters exhibited

298

disseminated, moderate to severe, chronic-active interstitial pneumonia. Alveolar septa were

299

expanded by moderate amounts of fibrin, variably well-organized bundles of collagen and

300

infiltrated by moderate numbers of neutrophils and macrophages. Adjacent alveolar spaces

301

frequently contained moderate numbers to numerous macrophages with fewer degenerate and

302

non-degenerate neutrophils admixed with cellular debris (Fig. 7D). Greater than 50% of

303

evaluated alveolar spaces were lined by type II pneumocytes that occasionally exhibited pseudo-

304

stratified, columnar epithelial differentiation with a distinct ciliated apical border. Lymphocyte

305

infiltrates and perivascular lymphoid aggregates were absent in all evaluated sections.

306

Immunohistochemical reaction revealed numerous immunoreactive type I and type II

307

pneumocytes as well as immunoreactive ciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells (Fig. 7E).

308

Histopathologic evaluation of the spleen confirmed the absence of lymphoid follicles and peri-

309

arteriolar lymphoid sheaths. Extramedullary hematopoiesis, noted in both the spleen and liver,

310

consisted entirely of erythroid lineage cell populations.

Discussion

313

SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans varies from asymptomatic to severe respiratory disease that

314

can be fatal, especially in elderly and otherwise immunocompromised individuals. The lack of

315

preclinical animal models that replicate the severe disease of some COVID-19 patients is a

316

substantial hurdle for the progression of promising countermeasures from in vitro testing through

317

to clinical trials. A reliable small animal model would allow reproducible, in-depth analyses of

318

infection patterns, elucidation of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and serve as a

319

critical preclinical model for the initial in vivo step in evaluating COVID-19 countermeasures for

320

human use.

321

The Syrian hamster has been established as a SARS-CoV-2 animal model, but a more thorough

322

analysis had yet to be performed. To expand our understanding the Syrian hamster model, we

323

first determined that the hamster ACE2 receptor was compatible with the SARS-CoV-2 spike

324

protein binding domain. The level of binding and entry was consistently higher than the

325

corresponding assay testing human ACE2 binding activity. As the receptor binding data

326

suggested and other recent studies have shown, Syrian hamsters were susceptible to SARS-CoV-

327

2 infection resulting in moderate to severe broncho-interstitial pneumonia and prolonged virus

328

shedding of at least 10 days. The ID50 of SARS-CoV-2 in the Syrian hamster is low, roughly five

329

infectious particles will result in a productive infection in 50% of animals.

330

Symptoms of disease appear approximately 3dpi, but clinical signs are minimal with a consistent

331

but not severe weight loss of 5-10%. Ruffled fur may be observed in some hamsters, respiration

332

rates may increase slightly, but the behavior is unchanged from naïve hamsters. Infection was

333

systemic following intranasal inoculation and viral gRNA was detected in all tissues examined.

334

However, the lungs were the major site of viral replication and clearly showed a consistent but

335

moderate pathology. Following intranasal infection, interstitial pneumonia initiating as

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.25.314070; this version posted September 27, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

336

bronchiolitis and focusing around terminal airways developed at 3dpi but was more severe in the

337

animals receiving higher infectious doses at this early time point. Pulmonary pathology

338

continued to increase in severity and extent of lesions in the lower dosed animals and was more

339

severe at 5dpi, with characteristic evidence of coronaviral infection noted including presence of

340

syncytial cells in bronchioles and alveolar spaces. Pulmonary pathology was diminished by

341

10dpi in all animals examined at those times with characteristic evidence of epithelial

342

regeneration noted.

343

In the human population, there have been reports of an increase in COVID-19 severity in males

344

(31, 32) as well as a disparity of COVID-19 severity among different age groups (33, 34). In

345

these studies, neither age nor gender was a factor in disease severity or outcome. Young

346

hamsters had similar shedding kinetics, virus titers in the lungs and developed similar pulmonary

347

pathology as aged hamsters regardless of sex. Importantly, all animals taken at the late

348

timepoints showed evidence of recovery from disease at a similar rate.

349

Interestingly, elimination of host adaptive immune responses in the IL2RG KO model resulted in

350

a chronic infection persisting at least 24 days. Virus was detectable in oral and rectal swabs at

351

5dpi and at study termination (24dpi). Histopathology evaluated at 24dpi supports a chronic-

352

active infection of the respiratory system with foci of epithelial regeneration as well as active

353

recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages. Unlike the immunocompetent hamster model, in

354

which antigen was only detectable outside of regions of pathology, SARS-CoV-2 antigen was

355

detectable in type I and type II pneumocytes, hyperplastic pneumocytes in regions of

356

regeneration and macrophages. Additionally, viral antigen was present in morphologically

357

normal bronchial epithelial cells at 24dpi, a feature only routinely observed at 3dpi in the

358

immunocompetent hamster model. While histopathology revealed a moderate to severe

359

pulmonary inflammatory response, clinical signs of severe respiratory disease was not observed

360

in this model. These data suggest that the innate immune system, in the background of

361

compromised adaptive immunity, is capable of depressing the viral infection enough to keep

362

respiratory physiology relatively stable, but incapable of eliminating SARS-CoV-2 infection.

363

Additionally, vascular changes and perivascular leukocyte infiltrates were not observed in the

364

IL2RG KO model, unlike the immunocompetent hamster model. This data, even though limited

365

to four animals, suggests that the adaptive immune response or IL-2 signaling pathway may play

366

a critical role in the development of innate leukocyte recruitment and staging during viral

367

infection and the regulation of the coagulation cascade in response to a pro-inflammatory local

368

environment.

369

Both autopsy and terminal biopsy samples from human patients exhibiting COVID-19 disease

370

have shown histologic evidence of diffuse alveolar disease, and death is frequently attributed to

371

the clinical progression of pneumonia, often times resulting in acute respiratory distress. Diffuse

372

alveolar disease in SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristic lesions of hyaline membrane

373

formation in alveolar spaces accompanied with proteinaceous fluid leaking from damaged

374

vessels into alveolar spaces. In hamsters, there is evidence of alveolar epithelial damage at peak

375

virus replication with lesion resolution later on. However, the hamster model fails to develop

376

fulminant diffuse alveolar disease and lacks the respiratory decompensation associated with the

377

clinical syndrome of acute respiratory distress. Relative to the recently developed NHP models

378

(8, 10), the Syrian hamster model exhibits a similar mild disease phenotype and is well suited for

379

assessing therapeutics or vaccines.

380

Another effective small animal model of COVID-19, the human ACE2 mouse, show these

381

animals develop pneumonia resulting in fatal disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection (14, 24,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.25.314070; this version posted September 27, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

382

35). However, with this mouse model there is concern about the location and level of receptor

383

expression in these human ACE2 transgenic mice. The increase in expression locales and levels

384

could result in enhanced or systemic disease dissimilar to COVID-19 in humans as these animals

385

have been reported to develop fatal encephalitis (35), a clinical manifestation not currently

386

associated with severe COVID-19 disease in humans. Additionally, the human ACE2 mouse has

387

been previously shown to cause neuronal death without evidence of encephalitis in the SARS-

388

CoV-1 model (36). These complications may limit therapeutic studies in the human ACE2

389

mouse model.

390

Although, as with all animal models, there are some limitations exemplified by the lack of a

391

systemic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The only mild disease manifestation and ability to

392

quickly limit the infection make this model less suitable to study the mechanisms of severe

393

COVID-19. However, the consistent and easily measured lung disease found in hamsters of all

394

ages and sex make this a suitable infection model to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 countermeasure

395

development.

Figure 2: Susceptibility of Syrian hamsters to SARS-CoV-2. Syrian hamsters were inoculated

514

intranasally with 10-fold limiting dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 beginning at 103 TCID50. Weights

515

were collected daily and shedding was assessed via swab samples (nasal and rectal) collected at

516

3dpi and 5dpi. Viral loads were determined as genome copies and infectious virus. (A) Daily

(E) Infectious lung titers at 5dpi. A statistical significance was found between the groups

519

presented in (A), with the group receiving the highest dose of 103 TCID50 losing the most weight.

520

The group receiving the second highest infectious dose (102 TCID50) lost statistically less than

521

the 103 TCID50 group but statistically more weight than the 2 groups receiving the two lowest

522

infectious doses. (B-E) A statistically significance difference was found between the group

523

receiving the lowest dose (100 TCID50) and all other groups. Multiple t tests comparing groups

524

directly were used to analyze significance. Note: blue circles, 100 TCID50 dose; red square, 101

538

CoV-2. Lungs were fixed in 10% formalin, cut and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) to

539

examine pulmonary pathology at 3, 5 and 10dpi. (A-C), 3dpi. (A) Inflammation initiates within

540

interstitial spaces in and around terminal airways with a minimal cellular exudate into the airway

spaces (100x, size bar is 50um). (B) Bronchiolar epithelial necrosis with influx of neutrophils

542

into the mucosa and airway lumen (400x, size bar is 20um). (C) Attenuation of the tracheal

543

mucosa with loss of apical cilia accompanied with an influx of moderate numbers of degenerate

544

and non-degenerate neutrophils (400x, size bar is 20um). (D-F), 5dpi. (D) Locally extensive

545

inflammation is noted (100x, size bar is 50um). (E) Progressive bronchiolitis with degenerate

546

and non-degenerate neutrophils and exudate within the lumen and prominent epithelial syncytial

547

cells (arrows; 400x, size bar is 20um). (F) Alveolar spaces contain macrophages and neutrophils.

548

Alveolar septa are thickened and expanded by fibrin, edema fluid and infiltrating leukocytes and

549

are lined by prominent type II pneumocytes (arrowhead) and rare syncytial cells (arrow; 400x,

550

size bar is 20um). (G-I), 10dpi. (G) Resolving inflammation is largely limited to bronchioles and

551

the adjacent alveolar spaces (100x, size bar is 50um) (H) Alveolar septa are thickened by

552

collagen with lymphocytes and lined by numerous plump type II pneumocytes that surround low
