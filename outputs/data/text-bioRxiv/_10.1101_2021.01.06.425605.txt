Abstract
Viruses must efficiently and specifically package their genomes while excluding cellular nucleic
acids and viral sub-genomic fragments. Some viruses use specific packaging signals, which are
conserved sequence/structure motifs present only in the full-length genome. Recent work has
shown that viral proteins important for packaging can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation
(LLPS), where one or two viral nucleic acid binding proteins condense with the genome. The
compositional simplicity of viral components lends itself well to theoretical modeling compared
to more complex cellular organelles. Viral LLPS can be limited to one or two viral proteins and a
single genome that is enriched in LLPS-promoting features. In our previous study, we observed
that LLPS-promoting sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are located at the 5¢ and 3¢ ends of the genome,
whereas the middle of the genome is predicted to consist mostly of solubilizing elements. Is this
arrangement sufficient to drive single genome packaging, genome compaction, and genome
cyclization? We addressed these questions using a coarse-grained polymer model, LASSI, to
study the LLPS of nucleocapsid protein with RNA sequences that either promote LLPS or
solubilization. With respect to genome compaction and cyclization, we find the most optimal
arrangement restricts LLPS-promoting elements to the 5¢ and 3¢ ends of the genome, consistent
with the native spatial patterning. Single genome packaging is possible for diverse
arrangements of LLPS-promoting sequences in the genome, but only in limited conditions at the
edge of the phase boundary. These results suggest that many and variably positioned LLPS
promoting signals can support packaging in the absence of a singular packaging signal which
argues against necessity of such a feature. We hypothesize that this model should be
generalizable to multiple viruses as well as cellular organelles like paraspeckles, which enrich
specific, long RNA sequences in a defined order.
Statement of significance
The COVID-19 pandemic has motivated research of the basic mechanisms of coronavirus
replication. A major challenge faced by viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 is the selective packaging of
a large genome in a relatively small capsid while excluding host and subgenomic nucleic acids.
Genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 can condense with the Nucleocapsid (N)-protein, a protein
component critical for packaging of many viruses. Notably, certain regions of the genomic RNA
drive condensation of N-protein while other regions solubilize it. Here, we explore how the
spatial patterning of these opposing elements promotes single genome compaction, packaging,
and cyclization. This model informs future in silico experiments addressing spatial patterning of

genomic features that are experimentally intractable because of the extensive size of the
genome.
Introduction
Biomolecular condensation is a simple and versatile way for cells to spatially and temporally
control biochemistry. It is now clear that a wide variety of compartments likely form using the
process of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) which leads to a condensation of specific
components out of bulk cytosol or nucleoplasm (7). The protein components of condensates
tend to contain intrinsically disordered or low complexity sequences and RNA-binding domains
(8). Many condensates also contain nucleic acids, and indeed RNA can promote phase
separation in many instances (9). However, the contributions of specific RNA sequences and
structures in condensate assembly, contents, and material properties is poorly understood (9).
Viruses present a powerful system to examine sequence specificity for both proteins and
nucleic acids in phase separation because of their highly compact genomes and limited protein
coding genes. Indeed, reports have emerged for VSV (10), respiratory syncytial virus (11),
rabies (12), measles (13), and HIV (14) components showing the capacity to undergo LLPS.
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive strand RNA virus that has an exceptionally large genome of 30kb which
is packaged into a relatively small capsid estimated to be ~100 nm in diameter (20). How the
genome is selected out of the sub-genomic RNAs generated by the virus and the host
transcriptome and sufficiently compressed to fit into a virion is not yet understood. A
packaging signal for SARS-CoV-1 is still not clear, although one sequence has been found to be
sufficient but not necessary to package RNA (21).
The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 undergoes LLPS (1,16,26,27), and our work found this
occurs in an RNA sequence-specific manner with different regions of the genome (1).
Remarkably, RNAs of the same length can either promote or limit phase separation depending
on their sequences. The sequences with differing behavior also show distinct patterns of
binding of N-protein with LLPS-promoting sequences having discrete patterned N-protein
interactions, while RNA sequences that limit phase separation are uniformly coated in Nprotein. The regions that promote phase separation are in the 5¢ and 3¢ ends of the genome,
prompting us to speculate that phase separation could be relevant to packaging, as these LLPSpromoting sequences are present specifically on the whole genome and would not be together
on sub-genomic or host RNAs.
Here, we developed a coarse-grained model to test the hypothesis that phase separation could
be a relevant process for selecting and compacting a single genome. Our goal was to examine
how the linear location of different RNA sequences in the genome generates spatially
segregated and condensed RNA molecules. We first explore fragments of the SARS-CoV-2
genome that have opposing phase behavior when mixed with N-protein, as shown in (1).
Specifically, the 5¢ and 3¢ ends of the genome promote phase separation, while the
frameshifting element (FE) and central regions of the genome solubilize N-protein (Fig 1a). We
next examine the spatial patterning of these opposing elements within a full genome model

and quantify its effects on phase separation, packaging of single genomes, genome compaction,
and genome cyclization. We find that in this model localization of LLPS-promoting features to
the 5¢ and 3¢ ends of the genome is sufficient to drive LLPS-based single genome packaging and
genome compaction, and is necessary for genome cyclization.

The appropriate subsets of these interactions were used for the simulations involving N-protein
alone, N-protein and 5¢ end RNA, N-protein and FE RNA, and all spatial rearrangements of
beads in genomic and 6-bead RNA chain simulations. Simulations of N-protein alone were run
at 15 temperatures linearly spaced between 1 a.u. and 2 a.u., and 15 concentrations
logarithmically spaced between 1e-4 and 1e-0.3, each for 1e9 total time steps with the first 5e6
timesteps discarded as equilibration. For all ternary systems, simulations were run at a single
temperature, 1 a.u., for 3e9 timesteps and 5e6 steps discarded as equilibration. Concentrations

of each component were chosen to be logarithmically spaced across the ranges of interest, with
hundreds of ([protein], [RNA]) coordinates sampled for each system (Fig S1). For N-protein with
6-bead RNA chains, the maximum number of N-protein and RNA chains were used such that
the total beads in the system never exceeded 40000 and the target stoichiometries were
satisfied. For simulations with gRNA and N-protein, 10 gRNA molecules were always used, and
the number of N-protein chains was altered to match target stoichiometries. At the lowest
gRNA and highest N-protein volume fractions, the number of gRNA molecules was gradually
scaled down to 1 due to computational limitations on the sizes of the systems. At each
coordinate, 2 independent simulations were run with and without interactions, for a total of 4
simulations at each concentration coordinate.
Simulation analysis
Analysis was performed using scripts within LASSI and custom scripts that relied upon the ovito
python module (23). Specifically, LASSI outputs a global density inhomogeneity value, 𝜌̅ , for
each simulation, which is used to determine whether phase separation has occurred. We used
the ovito module to calculate cluster sizes using a maximum cutoff of 3!⁄" since this is the
farthest apart two interacting particles can be in a cubic lattice. The radius of gyration for each
gRNA molecule was calculated according to the equation in the text. Ovito was also used to
calculate end-to-end distances of genomic RNAs. We counted genomes as cyclized if their
terminal beads were within 3!⁄" units of each other, since this is the farthest apart two
adjacent particles can be in a cubic lattice. For all of these metrics, a snapshot from the final
frame of each simulation was used for calculation. A single frame supplied sufficient statistics,
since we did not see significant variation among independent runs for each system (Fig S2). 𝜌̅ ,
cluster metrics, 〈𝑅$ 〉, cyclized genome percentages were interpolated to a grid logarithmically
spaced between 1e-4 and 1 with a discretization of 80 points along the protein and RNA axes.
Interpolation was performed using interpolate.griddata from scipy with a two-dimensional
piecewise cubic, continuously differentiable, and approximately curvature-minimizing
polynomial surface. Contours at 𝜌̅ = 0.025 were used to determine phase boundaries. Plots
were made using matplotlib.
Results
Simulations recapitulate known phase behavior and binding patterns of N-protein with FE
and 5¢ end RNA
We first sought to characterize the phase behavior of different regions of the viral genome by
focusing on simulations involving the N-protein with either the first 1000 nucleotides of the
genome (5¢ end RNA) or 1000 nucleotides around the frameshifting region located between
ORF1A and ORF1B (FE RNA). Simulations were carried out using LASSI, which employs coarsegrained representations and generates full phase diagrams and thermodynamic readouts (2).
The first consideration was how to represent the N-protein and RNA in a coarse-grained
manner based on existing data. The N-protein has two RNA binding domains (RBDs), a
dimerization domain which overlaps with RBD2, and three intrinsically disordered regions (Fig
1a). RBD1 is conserved across multiple betacoronavirus genomes and has previously been

shown to interact with the conserved sequences and structures in the 5¢ UTR (15). We
previously demonstrated that a single point mutant within RBD1, Y109A, greatly reduces Nprotein phase separation and changes N-protein interactions with 5¢ end RNA, while only
minimally affecting protein binding and phase behavior with FE RNA (1). Since FE RNA primarily
solubilized N-protein, and deletion of the RBD2/dimerization domain blocked N protein LLPS
(16), we postulated that FE may block N-protein phase separation by specifically interacting
with RBD2 and preventing N-protein dimerization. Thus, we hypothesize that N-protein RBD1
primarily binds to 5¢ end RNA, while RBD2 primarily binds to FE RNA.
Based on these data, we represented the N-protein as simply as possible using two spheres.
The first sphere participates in weak isotropic interactions with other N-proteins (representing
the association of the IDRs) and with the 5¢ end RNA (representing RBD1). The second sphere
participates in strong anisotropic interactions with other N-proteins to capture dimerization
and the interaction with the FE RNA via RBD2 (Fig 1a). These latter anisotropic interactions
operate under the assumption that N-protein dimerization competes with binding to FE RNA,
since anisotropic binding in this model is one-to-one. To model charge effects, the RNA
molecules experience an isotropic repulsive force amongst themselves. Using these
specifications, we sought to qualitatively reproduce the phase behavior among these molecules
established experimentally in (1). We found that, relative to N-protein phase separation on its
own (Fig 1b), addition of 5¢ end RNA promotes enhanced phase separation across a wide range
of protein and RNA concentrations (Fig 1c), while addition of FE RNA does not promote phase
separation and solubilizes N-protein at sufficiently high concentrations of RNA (Fig 1d).

protein with FE RNA at temperature 1 a.u. is solubilized at sufficiently high FE RNA
concentrations.
In addition to opposing phase behavior, the binding of N-protein to 5¢ end and FE RNA as a
function of N-protein concentration was shown to be distinctly patterned based on protein
crosslinking in (1). While FE RNA is uniformly coated with protein across a wide range of protein
concentrations, 5¢ end RNA has a few discrete binding sites and is only gradually coated more
with protein as the protein concentration is increased. The simulations report a similar distinct
pattern of protein interactions. For a fixed RNA concentration and at low bulk protein
concentrations, 5¢ end RNA is initially coated with very little protein (Fig 2a). As the bulk protein
concentration is increased, 5¢ end RNA sharply transitions to binding large amounts of protein
(Fig 2a). In contrast, FE RNA binds more protein at low protein concentrations, relative to 5¢ end
RNA, and experiences a more gradual transition to high amounts of bound protein (Fig 2b). In
all, the distinct protein binding behavior of these two RNA elements is consistent with that
found in (1) (Fig 2c). Thus, the simulation results are consistent with the experimental system
and support that the coarse-grained representations and binding energies are reasonable
approximations of the actual system.

boundaries for 5¢ end RNA with N-protein (A) and FE RNA (B) with N-protein are shown in red.

chains to RNA chains within that cluster is reported. C) For any given fixed RNA concentration,
as the protein concentration is increased, 5¢ end RNA shows a sharp transition to highly bound
protein, while FE shows a more gradual and transition, with more proteins bound at low protein
concentrations relative to the 5¢ end system.
Whole genome simulations reveal effects of phase separation on single genome packaging,
genome compaction, and genome cyclization
The large size (30kb) of the genome makes it challenging to synthesize in vitro for experiments.
We therefore were eager to use this simulation space to ask questions about how the different
RNA-sequence elements will behave when present in cis on the same polymer, as they are
found in the native virus. To address if specific arrangements of RNA encoded features could be
sufficient for packaging a single genome, we utilized the same representations of the 5¢ end and
FE RNA and the N-protein described above and assembled a system that represents the Nprotein and the entire viral genome (gRNA) (Fig 3a). In addition to the 5¢ end of the gRNA, the 3¢
end was also found to promote phase separation with N-protein and shared similar protein
binding behavior and RNA sequence features (Fig 1a) (1). Central regions of the gRNA that were
studied behaved similarly to the FE RNA, and further, the internal portions of the genome were
predicted to be more similar to the FE than 5¢ end RNA (1). Taking into account the relative
sizes of nucleotides and amino acids, the gRNA is roughly 90x larger than N-protein, so our
representation involves 180-bead chains for each genome. An additional strong, anisotropic
interaction between the terminal beads of each gRNA chain is added to represent known
nucleotide complementarity between the 5¢ and 3¢ ends of the gRNA and propensity to
crosslink in vivo (3).
For a given protein concentration, phase separation of N-protein in the gRNA system occurs
over a smaller range of RNA concentrations relative to the 5¢ end system (Fig 1c, Fig 3b). This is
consistent with experiments in which 5¢ end and FE RNAs were combined in trans which led to
more limited phase separation compared to 5¢ end RNA alone (1). However, phase separation
can occur at lower concentrations of protein and gRNA due to the length of the gRNA chains,
which is also consistent with experiments that were performed with RNA purified from infected
cells that contained gRNA (1). We quantified the average amount of protein bound to a single
genome and found that the contour delineating an equal volume fraction of protein and gRNA
per cluster aligns well with the high-RNA concentration edge of the phase envelope (white
dotted line, Fig 3b). The area to the right of this contour indicates bulk concentrations of Nprotein and gRNA that lead to a majority of volume fraction per cluster occupied by N-protein.
This region includes almost all of the phase separating regime and likely captures the most
relevant stoichiometries of gRNA and N-protein during infection in host cells and virion
assembly (4).

During virion assembly, single genomes must be packaged within a capsid built of structural
proteins and N-protein (5), so we also quantified how many gRNA chains were in each phase
separated cluster. We defined a simple metric to quantify single gRNA packaging; the number
of gRNA-containing clusters in the system is divided by the total number of gRNA chains.
Therefore, the metric is 1 when single-genome packaging is perfect, and approaches 0 as
multiple genomes are clustered together. Our analysis indicates that, for the most part, phase
separation hinders packaging of single gRNAs in clusters (Fig 3c). However, at the lowest Nprotein and gRNA concentrations within the phase boundary and along the edge of the
boundary, single packaging can occur. This finding supports the possibility that phase
separation can promote singularity in packaging, but only with specific bulk concentrations of
protein and RNA.
If arranged linearly, the 30kb genome has an end-to-end length of roughly 10000nm. However,
during virion assembly, this genome must be packaged into a viral particle with a diameter of
about 100nm, representing an immense compaction challenge. We reasoned that phase
separation with N-protein could provide a simple mechanism for gRNA compaction. To quantify
compaction, we measured the average radius of gyration of gRNA in each simulation (17),
*

where 𝑁 = 180 is the number of monomers in a chain, 𝑟⃑% is the position of monomer k, and
𝑟⃑mean is the average position of monomers in the chain. 𝑅$ is computed for each gRNA in a
simulation, and the average across gRNAs, 〈𝑅$ 〉, is reported for each simulation. We found that
phase separation indeed leads to more compact genomes (Fig 3d). In particular, for
intermediate bulk protein concentrations (between protein volume fractions of 0.01 and 0.1),
genomes are especially compact, with 〈𝑅$ 〉 between 5 and 10 particle diameters. Notably, at
the concentrations within the phase boundary where genomes are singularly packaged, there is
a low degree of gRNA compaction, and vice versa, suggesting that these processes compete
(Fig. 3d).
Genome cyclization is important for replication of many RNA viruses (6), and there is recent in
vivo evidence of cyclization of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (3). We thus sought to characterize the
potential role of phase behavior in genome cyclization in our model. We hypothesized that the
similar RNA features at the 5¢ and 3¢ ends of the genome would promote cyclization when
undergoing phase separation with N-protein. We defined a cyclized genome as one whose
terminal beads occupy adjacent lattice sites. For the final frame of each simulation, we
quantified the percentage of genomes that met this criterion. Strikingly, we see that up to 50%
of genomes are cyclized for concentrations within the phase boundary, with additional but
lesser cyclization beyond the equal N-protein gRNA volume fraction contour (Fig 3e). Thus, it
appears that sufficient binding of N-protein is essential for cyclization of gRNA molecules, with
phase separation providing additional efficiency.

cluster identified in each simulation. The white dotted line indicates the contour along which an

Spatial patterning gRNA mutants can enhance single genome packaging but limit compaction
and prevent genome cyclization
Since the 5¢ and 3¢ ends of the gRNA were both found to promote phase separation with Nprotein, we hypothesized that this spatial arrangement of phase separation-promoting
elements at the ends of the genome may be relevant to packaging. We investigated the
importance of the arrangement of phase separation-promoting sequences on the ends of the
gRNA by designing mutants where these regions are rearranged. We created three mutants, all
of which retain 12 5¢ end-like beads and the anisotropic interaction among their terminal
beads. The 5¢ end-like beads are repositioned either in the middle of the genome (middle),
uniformly throughout (uniform), or on one end (end) (Fig 4a). The phase boundaries of each of
the mutants remain relatively unchanged with respect to the WT system, suggesting that the
relative abundance and not the spatial patterning of 5¢ end and FE RNA beads determines the
bulk concentrations at which phase separation occurs (Fig 4). However, we observed
differences in the genome packaging metrics relative to WT and among the mutants.
The uniform system is highly efficient at packaging single genomes into clusters, with middle
gRNA slightly less effective, and end gRNA behaving similarly to WT (Fig 4b). Thus, it appears
that dispersed or centrally located phase separating elements within the gRNA are preferred for
single genome packaging by N-protein alone. Interestingly, however, effects on genome
compaction appear to behave in an opposite manner. Uniform gRNA does not significantly
compact upon phase separation, with middle gRNA compacting intermediately, and end gRNA
compacting similarly to WT (Fig 4c). As in the WT gRNA simulations these results reiterate the
possibility that single packaging and compaction of genomes by phase separation with Nprotein arise from competing processes and will be further explored in the next section.
Given the positioning of the wildtype LLPS promoting sequences at the ends of the genome, we
postulated that rearrangement of the location of these sequences would have the strongest
impact on genome cyclization. To this end, we also quantified genome cyclization for these
mutants, and found that none of them were able to cyclize genomes (Fig 4d). Importantly, each
of these systems maintains an intrinsic bonding capability between the terminal beads of its

Figure 4: Spatial patterning gRNA mutants show genome packaging metrics. A) Three spatial
patterning genome mutants were constructed. Each mutant retains the same number of 5¢ endlike and FE-like beads as in WT. The terminal beads maintain their anisotropic interaction,
regardless of their identity as 5¢ end-like or FE-like. B) Phase boundaries are shown in red for
each spatial patterning mutant system. The white dotted line indicates the contour along which
an equal volume fraction of N-protein and gRNA is found within a given cluster and is included

chains. D) Phase boundaries are shown in cyan. The heatmaps show the percentage of cyclized

Phase behavior and gRNA packaging can be continuously tuned by titrating 5¢ end-like and FElike RNA elements
Our studies so far have assumed that 5¢ end and FE RNA elements are perfectly distinct in their
N-protein binding modes and thus phase behavior. The initial empirical studies on which these
assumptions are based were limited in scope, but given the size of the genome, it is likely that
further LLPS-promoting or inhibiting elements are also heterogeneously distributed throughout
the gRNA. We investigated the phase behavior of six-bead RNA chains that gradually transition
from a pure 5¢ end identity to a FE one (Fig 5). As the identity of the RNA chains changes, the
phase boundary gradually shifts from one extreme to the other, suggesting that phase behavior
and resultant properties like single packaging, compaction, and cyclization can be precisely
tuned by proper positioning of these elements in the gRNA.

With this understanding, in addition to the optimal packaging in the uniform system and

the WT arrangement at the ends, with 12 additional 5¢ end-like beads uniformly spaced
throughout its length (Fig 6a). We found that phase separation occurs over a slightly broader
range of concentrations, and that all studied genome packaging metrics are enhanced, relative
to WT. Single genome packaging is slightly more preferable at low concentrations of N-protein
and gRNA relative to WT, though efficient packaging is still limited to this corner of the phase
envelope (Fig 6b). Single packaging is less efficient relative to the uniform mutant, which
provides further evidence that the WT arrangement of phase separation promoting beads at
the 5¢ and 3¢ ends counteracts the effects of uniformly distributed phase separation promoting
beads. In our optimal gRNA, significant genome compaction occurs across much of the phase
envelope, with an optimal range of N-protein extending almost an order of magnitude lower
than in WT (Fig 6c). Unlike the results for single genome packaging, the genome compaction
data suggest that the combination WT and uniform arrangements of 5¢ end-like beads
cooperatively promote compaction. Genome cyclization remains high, similar to WT, with most
efficient cyclization occurring in the lower-left corner of the phase envelope (Fig 6d).

For this optimized gRNA design, there appears to be a concentration regime corresponding to
the low gRNA and N-protein concentration corner of the phase envelope where single genome
packaging, compaction, and cyclization can all occur efficiently. These results raise two
predictions concerning the virion assembly process. First, there exists an optimal concentration
range of gRNA and N-protein, just within the phase boundary, that promotes virion assembly.

Second, phase-separation promoting gRNA sequences may be located not only at the 5¢ and 3¢
ends, but also sparsely distributed throughout the genome to enhance genome packaging.
Discussion
It is clear that protein and RNA elements of SARS-CoV-2 can engage in phase separation with Nprotein, but the functional consequences of this physical chemistry capacity for viral replication
remain elusive. In this study we sought to explore how the spatial patterning of phase
separation promoting or inhibiting RNA elements in the genome could facilitate the specificity
and singularity of packaging the genome. Using coarse-grained simulations rooted in empirical
observations, we find that phase separation can promote conditions that favor singular
packaging, but that many spatial patterns of opposing phase separating elements can function
similarly. However, the arrangement of phase separation promoting sequences at the ends of
the genome is critical for genome compaction, and the positioning of these elements at both
ends is necessary for cyclization.
Biophysical interpretation of the different protein binding modes leading to opposing phase
behavior
An essential feature of our model is the different binding mode of N-protein with 5¢ end and FE
RNA. We found that weak, isotropic interactions with 5¢ end RNA promote phase separation,
while strong, anisotropic interactions with FE RNA lead to N-protein solubilization. Intrinsically,
the valence of the isotropic interactions is 26 in a cubic lattice, while the valence is 1 for the
anisotropic interactions. Additionally, since the anisotropic interactions have a higher binding
energy than the isotropic ones, they last for longer, which effectively compounds the difference
in valence between the 5¢ end and FE beads. For the FE RNA system, this design allows for more
N-protein binding at lower protein concentrations, but a less significant increase in protein
binding as the protein concentration is increased. On the other hand, 5¢ end RNA experiences a
cooperative binding effect with N-protein, leading to greatly increased protein binding as
protein concentrations are increased. The valence difference between 5¢ end and FE RNA also
includes competition between N-protein-FE RNA binding and N-protein dimerization, since a
single bead in the model is responsible for both interactions. Therefore, while N-protein is
bound to FE RNA, it can no longer dimerize, but while it is bound to 5¢ end RNA, it is free to
dimerize. We suspect that this competition also compounds the cooperative effect of the Nprotein binding to each of these different RNAs and contributes to the distinct behaviors of
these different polymers. The agreement between experimental results and our model suggests
that there may be some underlying differences in the N-protein-RNA interactions in the 5¢ endlike and FE-like regions in the gRNA that lead to distinct protein binding behavior. We
hypothesize that FE-like regions have a lower effective valence with respect to N-protein than
5¢ end-like regions, which will need to be explored experimentally in future work.
Boomerang shape of the phase boundaries
It has been previously reported that phase boundaries in ternary systems that are purely driven
by heterotypic interactions are roughly elliptical in log-log space (2). However, the phase
diagrams of the ternary systems studied in this work have distinct shapes. The 5¢ end RNA with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.06.425605; this version posted January 6, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

N-protein phase diagram resembles an elliptical shape combined with a high N-protein
concentration arm that corresponds well to the shape of the FE RNA with N-protein phase
diagram. Each of these high N-protein concentration arms roughly correspond to the N-protein
concentration range where phase separation occurs for N-protein alone at temperature 1 a.u.,
the temperature at which all ternary systems were studied (Fig 1b-d). The same superimposed
shape is even more apparent in the gRNA with N-protein phase diagrams, with boundaries that
resemble boomerangs (Fig 3b-e). We hypothesize that these phase diagrams arise from the
union of two regimes of phase behavior that are driven by distinct forces. The elliptical portion
that extends to low N-protein and RNA concentrations demonstrates phase separation that is
driven by heterotypic interactions between RNA and N-protein, which aligns with reports in (2).
On the other hand, the high concentration N-protein portion of the phase diagrams indicates
phase separation that is driven by N-protein homotypic interactions. Here, RNA can partition
into the dense phase, but it is neither necessary for phase separation, nor is it the driver.
Therefore, the FE RNA with N-protein phase diagram consists only of this high N-protein
concentration regime, which is eventually capped at high enough RNA concentrations (Fig 1d).
As more FE RNA is present to sequester N-protein out of solution, the concentration of the
available pool of N-protein is effectively decreased and phase separation can no longer occur.
For systems with 5¢ end RNA present, the phase diagrams have a complex reentrant character,
passing in and out of the phase separating regime for certain fixed RNA concentrations as Nprotein concentration is changed (Fig 1c, 3b-e). We speculate that this reentrant behavior is
due to the interplay of phase separation driven by heterotypic or homotypic interactions, with
intermediate regimes where neither are strong enough to drive phase separation. It is
interesting to speculate whether such rich phase behavior may exist in other multicomponent
systems, specifically those that involve long nucleotide polymers and RNA- or DNA-binding
proteins.
Compatibility with the single packaging signal model
A recent model of single genome packaging has emerged as part of a study of the SARS-CoV-2
N-protein (18). The authors showed that for a 2-bead representation of N-protein that
experienced isotropic attraction to itself and a long, 61-bead RNA molecule, large phaseseparated clusters would form. However, if a much stronger binding site was added to the
center of the RNA chain, mimicking a hypothetical packaging signal, N-protein and RNA chains
would instead form kinetically trapped clusters that only very slowly coalesced into a single
phase-separated droplet. This model is simpler than the one presented here, but it is
reminiscent of the distinct effects seen here between 5¢ end RNA and FE RNA. In our model, the
most important effective difference between the 5¢ end and FE RNA beads is their valence, with
5¢ end RNA having a much higher valence than FE RNA. The model in (18) includes only a
difference in binding energy, since all beads interact isotropically. However, the higher binding
energy beads have a lower effective valence than the low energy beads at a given timescale,
since they participate in bonds with fewer partners. In line with our results, the presence of
lower-valence binding sites sequesters N-protein into clusters, opposing large-scale phase
separation. Indeed, other groups have shown that a high enough valence is required for phase
separation to occur in silico (28) and in vitro (24). In our model, however, most of the binding
sites on the gRNA are of a low-valence character, which is distinct from the single, low-valence,

packaging signal site in (18). Despite this difference, both models provide evidence that such
low-valence sites are essential for packaging tasks required during virion assembly, and that
runaway phase separation must be tempered via alternative self-assembly pathways.
Generalization to other viruses and systems with long RNAs or DNA
Our models developed here are sufficiently coarse-grained to speculate that they may be
applicable to other viruses and systems that involve long nucleotide chains and proteins.
Components from several viruses have been shown to undergo phase separation, raising the
possibility that spatial patterning of specific LLPS-promoting RNA or DNA sequences may have
evolved to promote optimal genome packaging in other viruses in addition to SARS-CoV-2.
Many cellular phase separated bodies involve long RNAs or DNA and proteins that bind them. A
particularly relevant example for our modeling is paraspeckles. Paraspeckles are highly ordered,
phase separated nuclear bodies that require the presence of the long noncoding RNA, NEAT1.
NEAT1 was recently shown to contain distinct functional domains, one of which is repetitive in
its sequence and is necessary for paraspeckle formation (19). Paraspeckles also require several
proteins, most of which contain RNA-binding domains and disordered regions (25). Recent work
has shown that the central region of NEAT1 is necessary and sufficient for paraspeckle
formation, and that it initiates assembly by binding several proteins (19). Specifically, the
proteins NONO and SPFQ must first bind NEAT1, dimerize, and promote further polymerization
via coiled-coil domains with other proteins for paraspeckle assembly to continue (25). There are
thus many parallels with the SARS-CoV-2 system studied here; specific spatial patterning of
protein binding elements along the RNAs is essential, and the protein partners must be able to
dimerize/oligomerize for further assembly.
Conclusion
Identification of specific RNA sequences that promote ordered phase separated bodies via
protein binding will not only advance our understanding of viruses, but also the many diverse
cellular bodies and regions that contain long RNAs or DNA.
