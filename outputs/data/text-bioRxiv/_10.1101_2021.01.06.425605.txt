Abstract
Viruses must efficiently and specifically package their genomes while excluding cellular nucleic
acids and viral sub-genomic fragments. Some viruses use specific packaging signals, which are
conserved sequence/structure motifs present only in the full-length genome. Recent work has
shown that viral proteins important for packaging can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation
(LLPS), where one or two viral nucleic acid binding proteins condense with the genome. The
compositional simplicity of viral components lends itself well to theoretical modeling compared
to more complex cellular organelles. Viral LLPS can be limited to one or two viral proteins and a
single genome that is enriched in LLPS-promoting features. In our previous study, we observed
that LLPS-promoting sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are located at the 5¢ and 3¢ ends of the genome,
whereas the middle of the genome is predicted to consist mostly of solubilizing elements. Is this
arrangement sufficient to drive single genome packaging, genome compaction, and genome
cyclization? We addressed these questions using a coarse-grained polymer model, LASSI, to
study the LLPS of nucleocapsid protein with RNA sequences that either promote LLPS or
solubilization. With respect to genome cyclization, we find the most optimal arrangement
restricts LLPS-promoting elements to the 5¢ and 3¢ ends of the genome, consistent with the
native spatial patterning. Genome compaction is enhanced by clustered LLPS-promoting
binding sites, while single genome packaging is most efficient when binding sites are distributed
throughout the genome. These results suggest that many and variably positioned LLPSpromoting signals can support packaging in the absence of a singular packaging signal which
argues against necessity of such a feature. We hypothesize that this model should be
generalizable to multiple viruses as well as cellular organelles like paraspeckles, which enrich
specific, long RNA sequences in a defined arrangement.
Statement of significance
The COVID-19 pandemic has motivated research of the basic mechanisms of coronavirus
replication. A major challenge faced by viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 is the selective packaging of
a large genome in a relatively small capsid while excluding host and sub-genomic nucleic acids.
Genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 can condense with the Nucleocapsid (N-protein), a structural
protein component critical for packaging of many viruses. Notably, certain regions of the
genomic RNA drive condensation of N-protein while other regions solubilize it. Here, we
explore how the spatial patterning of these opposing elements promotes single genome
compaction, packaging, and cyclization. This model informs future in silico experiments

addressing spatial patterning of genomic features that are experimentally intractable because
of the length of the genome.
Introduction
Biomolecular condensation is a simple and versatile way for cells to spatially and temporally
control biochemistry. It is now clear that a wide variety of compartments likely form using the
process of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) which leads to a condensation of specific
components out of bulk cytosol or nucleoplasm (1). The protein components of condensates
tend to contain intrinsically disordered or low complexity sequences and RNA-binding domains
(2). Many condensates also contain nucleic acids, and indeed RNA can promote phase
separation in many instances (3). However, the contributions of specific RNA sequences and
structures in condensate assembly, contents, and material properties is poorly understood (3).
Viruses present a powerful system to examine sequence specificity for both proteins and
nucleic acids in phase separation because of their highly compact genomes and limited protein
coding genes. Indeed, reports have emerged for VSV (4), respiratory syncytial virus (5), rabies
(6), measles (7), and HIV (8) components showing the capacity to undergo LLPS.
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive strand RNA virus that has an exceptionally large genome of ~30kb
which is selectively packaged into a relatively small capsid estimated to be ~100 nm in diameter
(9). How the genome is selectively packaged while excluding sub-genomic RNAs generated by
the virus and the host transcriptome and sufficiently compressed to fit into a virion is not yet
understood. The necessity of a packaging signal for SARS-CoV-1 is still not clear, although one
sequence has been found to be sufficient but not necessary to package RNA (10). To our
knowledge, no packaging signal has been identified for SARS-CoV-2.
The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 undergoes LLPS (11-15), and our work found that this
occurs in an RNA sequence-specific manner with different regions of the genome (11).
Remarkably, RNAs of the same length can either promote or limit phase separation depending
on the sequences. The sequences with differing behavior also show distinct patterns of binding
of N-protein with LLPS-promoting sequences having discrete patterned N-protein interactions,
while RNA sequences that limit phase separation are uniformly coated in N-protein. The regions
that promote phase separation are in the 5¢ and 3¢ ends of the genome, prompting us to
speculate that phase separation could be relevant to packaging, as these LLPS-promoting
sequences are present specifically on the whole genome and would not be together on subgenomic or host RNAs.
Here, we developed a coarse-grained model to test the hypothesis that phase separation could
be a relevant process for selecting and compacting a single genome. Our goal was to examine
how the linear location of different RNA sequences in the genome generates spatially
segregated and condensed RNA molecules. We first explored fragments of the SARS-CoV-2
genome that have opposing phase behavior when mixed with N-protein, as shown in (11).
Specifically, the 5¢ and 3¢ ends of the genome promote phase separation, while the
frameshifting element (FE) and central regions of the genome solubilize N-protein (Fig 1A). We

next examined the spatial patterning of these opposing elements within a full genome model
and quantified its effects on phase separation, packaging of single genomes, genome
compaction, and genome cyclization. We found that in this model, localization of LLPSpromoting features to the 5¢ and 3¢ ends of the genome is sufficient to drive LLPS-based single
genome packaging and genome compaction, and is necessary for genome cyclization. Addition
of clustered LLPS-promoting features throughout the genome further enhanced all of these
metrics.

(gRNA) simulations. We performed parameter sweeps over many of these energies for the Nprotein only system, the 5ʹ end and FE RNA fragments with N-protein systems, and the Nprotein with gRNA systems, explained further in the main text and SI (Figs S2-S4, S7, S8).
Simulations of N-protein alone were run at 15 temperatures linearly spaced between 1
arbitrary unit (a.u.) and 2 a.u., and 15 concentrations logarithmically spaced between 1e-4 and
1e-0.3, each for 1e9 total time steps with 5e6 timesteps of thermalization. Temperature scales

anisotropic interactions are inactivated, and all chains are pushed to the center of the system,
as described in (16). For systems with short chains, like the 6- and 2-bead chains representing 5ʹ
end and FE RNA fragments and N-protein, respectively, this step allows for a more rapid
convergence to equilibrium if the system will phase separate. For very long chains, this step
may kinetically trap the system in a clustered state. For systems with N-protein and 5ʹ end and
FE RNA fragments, simulations were run at a single temperature, 1 a.u., for 1e9 timesteps and
5e6 steps of thermalization. For genomic RNA (gRNA) with N-protein systems, simulations were
run at a single temperature, 1 a.u., for 10e9 timesteps with no thermalization due to kinetic
trapping when thermalization was used. These simulations equilibrated to similar minimum
energies with or without thermalization, but had altered packaging properties (Fig S5, S6). We
concluded that since gRNA chains in thermalized systems gradually disengaged from the initial
central cluster over the course of simulations that their equilibrium states were not fully
clustered at the center, as observed for simulations without thermalization (Fig S5) and that
they were instead kinetically trapped. Thus, we did not use thermalization for gRNA systems.
For all ternary systems, concentrations of each component were chosen to be logarithmically
spaced across the ranges of interest, with hundreds of ([protein], [RNA]) coordinates sampled
for each system (Fig S1). For N-protein with 5ʹ end and FE RNA, the maximum number of Nprotein and RNA chains were used such that the total beads in the system never exceeded
40000 and the target stoichiometries were satisfied. For simulations with gRNA and N-protein,
10 gRNA molecules were always used, and the number of N-protein chains was altered to
match target stoichiometries. At the lowest gRNA and highest N-protein volume fractions, the
number of gRNA molecules was gradually scaled down to 1 due to computational limitations on
the sizes of the systems. At each coordinate, 2 independent simulations were run with and
without interactions, for a total of 4 simulations at each concentration coordinate.
Simulation analysis
Analysis was performed using scripts within LASSI and custom scripts that relied upon the ovito
python module (18). LASSI outputs a global density inhomogeneity value, 𝜌̅ , for each
simulation, which is used to determine whether phase separation has occurred. 𝜌̅ is calculated
using the pair distribution function for all beads in the system by default, as described in (16).
We used this default calculation for N-protein-only systems and the 5ʹ end and FE RNA
fragments with N-protein systems. However, for gRNA systems, we did not observe a dilute
phase of gRNA chains and concluded that phase separation of gRNA in this context was not
meaningful (more detail in main text). Instead, we calculated a new density inhomogeneity
metric, 𝜌̅ (𝑁), that uses the pair distribution function for only N-protein beads in the system.
Using this limited pair distribution function, we calculated 𝜌̅ (𝑁) analogously to 𝜌̅ as described

in (16). Contours at 𝜌̅ = 0.025 were used to determine phase boundaries for N-protein only
and 5ʹ end and FE RNA fragments systems. This value of 𝜌̅ was shown in (16) to universally
indicate the onset of phase separation. We used 𝜌̅ (𝑁) = 0.02 for gRNA systems as this value
better aligned with sharp transitions in 𝜌̅ (𝑁) as a function of volume fraction and resulted in
smoother phase boundaries. We used the ovito module to calculate clusters using a maximum
cutoff of 3#⁄$ , the maximum distance between two interacting particles in a cubic lattice. The
radius of gyration for each gRNA molecule was calculated according to the equation in the text.
Ovito was also used to calculate end-to-end distances of genomic RNAs. We counted genomes
as cyclized if their terminal beads were within 3#⁄$ units of each other. For all analysis of
packaging metrics in gRNA systems, 100 simulation snapshots were used from the last half of
simulations for each of 2 runs and averaged over time and runs. Snapshots were recorded
starting at 5e9 steps every 5e7 steps and used for analysis. For 5ʹ end and FE RNA fragments
with N-protein systems, 50 simulations snapshots were recorded starting 2e7 steps after
thermalization completion and used for analysis. For all systems, 𝜌̅ or 𝜌̅ (𝑁) and clustering and
packaging metrics were interpolated to a grid linearly spaced between 1e-4 and 1 with a
discretization of 80 points along the protein and RNA axes. Interpolation was performed using
interpolate.griddata from scipy. Plots were made using matplotlib.
Results
Simulations recapitulate known phase behavior and binding patterns of N-protein with FE
and 5¢ end RNA
We first sought to characterize the phase behavior of different regions of the viral genome by
focusing on simulations involving the N-protein with either the first 1000 nucleotides of the
genome (5¢ end RNA) or 1000 nucleotides around the frameshifting region located between
ORF1A and ORF1B (FE RNA). Simulations were carried out using LASSI, which employs stickersand-spacers representations of polymers and generates full phase diagrams by performing
Monte Carlo simulations at many temperatures and volume fractions of components (16).
Simulations take place on a cubic lattice, and only a single particle can occupy a given lattice
site at one time. In this work, polymer beads are connected by implicit linkers that do not
occupy space but rather guarantee that adjacent beads within chains are always in adjacent
lattice sites. The first consideration was how to represent the N-protein and RNA in a coarsegrained manner based on existing data. The N-protein has two RNA binding domains (RBDs), a
dimerization domain which overlaps with RBD2, and three intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs)
(Fig 1A). RBD1 is conserved across multiple betacoronavirus genomes and has previously been
shown to interact with the conserved sequences and structures in the 5¢ UTR (19). We
previously demonstrated that a single point mutant within RBD1, Y109A, greatly reduces Nprotein phase separation and changes N-protein interactions with 5¢ end RNA, while only
minimally affecting protein binding and phase behavior with FE RNA (11). Since FE RNA
primarily solubilized N-protein, and deletion of the RBD2/dimerization domain blocked Nprotein co-phase separation with RNA (12), we postulated that FE may block N-protein phase
separation by specifically interacting with RBD2 and preventing N-protein dimerization. Thus,

we hypothesize that N-protein RBD1 primarily binds to 5¢ end RNA, while RBD2 primarily binds
to FE RNA.
Based on these data, we represented the N-protein as simply as possible using two spheres.
The first sphere participates in weak isotropic interactions with other N-proteins (representing
the association of the IDRs) and with the 5¢ end RNA (representing RBD1). The second sphere
participates in strong anisotropic interactions with other N-proteins to capture dimerization
and the interaction with the FE RNA via RBD2 (Fig 1A). These latter anisotropic interactions
operate under the assumption that N-protein dimerization competes with binding to FE RNA,
since anisotropic binding in this model is one-to-one. To model charge effects, the RNA
molecules experience an isotropic repulsive force amongst themselves, both within chains and
among distinct RNA chains. Using these specifications, we sought to qualitatively reproduce the
phase behavior among these molecules established experimentally in (11). We found that,
relative to N-protein phase separation on its own (Fig 1B), addition of 5¢ end RNA promotes
enhanced phase separation across a wide range of protein and RNA concentrations (Fig 1C),
while addition of FE RNA does not promote phase separation and solubilizes N-protein at
sufficiently high concentrations of RNA (Fig 1D).

protein with FE RNA at temperature 1 a.u. is solubilized at sufficiently high FE RNA
concentrations.
In addition to opposing phase behavior, the binding of N-protein to 5¢ end and FE RNA as a
function of N-protein concentration was shown to be distinctly patterned based on protein
crosslinking in (11). While FE RNA is uniformly coated with protein across a wide range of
protein concentrations, 5¢ end RNA has a few discrete binding sites and is only gradually coated
more with protein as the protein concentration is increased. The simulations report a similar
distinct pattern of protein interactions. For a fixed RNA concentration and at low bulk protein
concentrations, 5¢ end RNA is initially coated with very little protein (Fig 2A). As the bulk protein
concentration is increased, 5¢ end RNA sharply transitions to binding large amounts of protein
(Fig 2A). In contrast, FE RNA binds more protein at low protein concentrations, relative to 5¢
end RNA, and experiences a more gradual transition to high amounts of bound protein (Fig 2B).
In all, the distinct protein binding behavior of these two RNA elements is consistent with that
found in (11) (Fig 2C). Thus, the simulation results are consistent with the experimental system
and support that the coarse-grained representations and binding energies are reasonable
approximations of the actual system.
We ran extensive parameter sweeps for these systems to determine the contributions of
specific interactions. For N-protein alone, the isotropic binding energy greatly influenced phase
behavior (Fig S2). Dimerization was necessary for phase separation for low isotropic binding
energies, including the default energy used for all following simulations (Fig S2). Interestingly,
the strength of the dimerization interaction was non-monotonically related to phase separation
propensity, with very high dimerization energies starting to weaken phase separation (Fig S2).
We also studied the effects of altering the strength of binding between N-protein and 5ʹ end
and FE RNA. The strength of the isotropic binding interaction between N-protein and 5ʹ end
RNA strongly influenced co-phase behavior (Fig S3). In contrast, the strength of the anisotropic
binding between N-protein and FE RNA did not alter phase behavior until very high energies,
when a new arm of the phase diagram emerged (Fig S3). We did observe differences in the
average number of N-proteins bound to FE outside of the phase envelope, with low anisotropic
energies leading to less binding (Fig S3). We doubled the magnitude of the RNA-RNA repulsive
isotropic energy and observed small effects on the phase behavior of N-protein with both 5ʹ
end RNA and FE RNA (Fig S4). Finally, we increased the isotropic binding energy between Nproteins and observed phase behavior in the context of 5ʹ end and FE RNA. Since N-protein
alone phase separates across a wider range of volume fractions under this condition, we see a
corresponding widening of the phase diagrams across these concentrations when mixed with
both RNA fragments (Fig S4). Additionally, more FE RNA is required to solubilize N-protein since
the N-proteins are more stably phase separated (Fig S4). The most sensitive interactions for
these systems appear to be the isotropic binding between N-proteins and the isotropic binding
of N-protein with 5ʹ end RNA.

found in the native virus. To address if specific arrangements of RNA encoded features could be
sufficient for packaging a single genome, we utilized the same representations of the 5¢ end and
FE RNA and the N-protein described above and assembled a system that represents the Nprotein and the entire viral genome (gRNA) (Fig 3A). In addition to the 5¢ end of the gRNA, the
3¢ end was also found to promote phase separation with N-protein and shared similar protein
binding behavior and RNA sequence features (Fig 1A) (11). Central regions of the gRNA that
were studied behaved similarly to the FE RNA, and further, the internal portions of the genome
were predicted to be more similar to the FE than 5¢ end RNA (11). Taking into account the
relative sizes of nucleotides and amino acids, the gRNA is roughly 90x larger than N-protein, so
our representation involves 180-bead chains for each genome. An additional strong, anisotropic
interaction between the terminal beads of each gRNA chain is added to represent known
nucleotide complementarity between the 5¢ and 3¢ ends of the gRNA and propensity to
crosslink in vivo (20).
Due to the length of gRNA chains, we were only able to include 10 chains per simulation, with
hundreds to thousands of N-proteins. Interestingly, we did not observe dilute phases of gRNA
chains under any conditions; there were no well-defined clusters including all gRNA chains, and
instead, all gRNA chains were coated with N-protein. N-protein demonstrated a well-defined
dilute phase and a dense phase on and around gRNA chains. For these reasons, we determined
that phase separation of gRNA in this context was not well-defined, and regarded gRNA instead
as a surface upon which N-protein phase separation occurred. To quantify this behavior, we
altered the definition of the density inhomogeneity metric, 𝜌̅ , originally defined as a function of
the pair distribution functions between all beads in a given simulation as explained in (16).
Since we observed a density transition only of N-protein in gRNA-containing systems, we
defined a new metric, 𝜌̅ (𝑁), which depends only on the pair distribution function of N-proteins
in the system. Thus, the following phase diagrams describing gRNA-containing systems are no
longer ternary phase diagrams as in Figs 1 and 2 with well-defined dilute phases of both
components. They instead indicate the density inhomogeneity of N-protein as a function of the
volume fraction of N-protein and the surface upon which they condense, gRNA.
For a given N-protein concentration, phase separation of N-protein in the gRNA system occurs
over a smaller range of RNA concentrations relative to the 5¢ end system (Fig 1C, Fig 3B). This
result is consistent with experiments in which 5¢ end and FE RNAs were combined in trans
which led to more limited phase separation compared to 5¢ end RNA alone (11). However,
phase separation of N-protein can occur at lower volume fractions of N-protein and gRNA due
to the length of the gRNA chains, which is also consistent with experiments that were
performed with RNA purified from infected cells that contained gRNA (11). We quantified the
average amount of protein bound to single genomes and found that the contour delineating an
equal volume fraction of protein and gRNA per cluster aligns well with the high-RNA
concentration edge of the phase envelope (white dotted line, Fig 3B). The area to the right of
this contour indicates bulk concentrations of N-protein and gRNA that lead to a majority of
volume fraction per cluster occupied by N-protein. This region includes almost all of the phase

separating regime and likely captures the most relevant stoichiometries of gRNA and N-protein
during infection in host cells and virion assembly (21).
During virion assembly, single genomes must be packaged within a capsid built of structural
proteins and N-protein (22), so we also quantified how many gRNA chains were in each phase
separated cluster. We defined a simple metric to quantify single gRNA packaging; the number
of gRNA-containing clusters in the system is divided by the total number of gRNA chains.
Therefore, the metric is 1 when single-genome packaging is perfect, and approaches 0 as
multiple genomes are clustered together. A zeroth-order effect due to excluded volume in the
absence of other interactions is shown in Fig S9A and demonstrates that single packaging
becomes impossible with prohibitively high volume fractions of N-protein or gRNA. In the
presence of interactions, our analysis indicates that, for the most part, N-protein phase
separation hinders packaging of single gRNAs in clusters (Fig 3C). However, at higher N-protein
volume fractions in the concave region below the phase envelope, single packaging is robust. It
appears that coexisting phases of N-protein condensed on gRNA and a dilute phase in solution
promotes clustering of gRNA, but that a more uniform, high density of N-protein throughout
the system effectively keeps gRNA chains separated.
If arranged linearly, the ~30kb genome has an end-to-end length of roughly 10000nm.
However, during virion assembly, this genome must be packaged into a viral particle with a
diameter of about 100nm, representing an immense compaction challenge. We reasoned that
N-protein binding could provide a simple mechanism for gRNA compaction. To quantify
compaction, we measured the average radius of gyration of gRNA in each simulation (23),
,

𝑅&$ = /(𝑟⃑' − 𝑟⃑mean )$
𝑁
'-#

where 𝑁 = 180 is the number of monomers in a chain, 𝑟⃑' is the position of monomer k, and
𝑟⃑mean is the average position of monomers in the chain. 𝑅& is computed for each gRNA in a
simulation, and the average across gRNAs, 〈𝑅& 〉, is reported for each simulation. Again, there is
an effect due solely to excluded-volume interactions that leads to compaction of gRNA chains
under more crowded conditions (Fig. S9). Therefore, we evaluated the effects of N-protein
binding interactions using the fold change in the radius of gyration in simulations with
interactions relative to those without interactions, log $ 9〈𝑅& 〉⁄〈𝑅&. 〉;. We found that N-protein
binding indeed leads to more compact genomes to the right of the equal protein-gRNA volume
fraction contour (dotted white line), and more extended genomes to the left of it (Fig 3D). As
seen with the single genome packaging metric, the most robust compaction occurs in the
concave region of the phase diagram with a high N-protein density (Fig 3D).
Genome cyclization is important for replication of many RNA viruses (24), and there is recent in
vivo evidence of cyclization of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (20). We thus sought to characterize the
potential role of phase behavior in genome cyclization in our model. We hypothesized that the
similar RNA features at the 5¢ and 3¢ ends of the genome would promote cyclization when

facilitating phase separation of N-protein. We defined a cyclized genome as one whose terminal
beads occupy adjacent lattice sites. Averaging over the final half of each simulation, we
quantified the percentage of genomes that met this criterion. Strikingly, we see that up to 4050% of genomes are cyclized for volume fractions to the right of the equal N-protein gRNA
volume fraction contour and within the phase boundary (Fig 3E). Thus, it appears that sufficient
binding of N-protein is essential for cyclization of gRNA molecules, with phase separation
providing additional efficiency.
We also performed parameter sweeps for this gRNA-containing system, focusing on the two
most sensitive interactions identified in the N-protein with 5ʹ end and FE RNA parameter
sweeps; these are the isotropic interaction between N-protein and 5ʹ end RNA and the isotropic
interaction between N-proteins. With an increased binding energy between N-protein and the
5ʹ end RNA beads in the gRNA, we saw a modest extension of the phase boundary (Fig S7A).
Single genome packaging (Fig S7B) and compaction (Fig S7C) are relatively unaffected with
respect to WT, but surprisingly, cyclization is much less efficient (Fig S7D). It appears that while
N-protein binding to the ends of gRNA chains can facilitate their co-location, very strong
binding may limit the ability of the ends of the gRNA chains to come into contact due to
interference from N-protein. For the system with increased isotropic interactions among Nproteins, we observed a widening of the phase boundary corresponding to the broader range of
volume fractions over which N-protein alone phase separates under this condition (Fig S8).
Single genome packaging is unaffected (Fig S8B), compaction is minimally enhanced in the
concave region below the phase envelope (Fig S8C), and genome cyclization is unaffected (Fig
S8D).

boundary is shown in cyan. The heatmap shows the percentage of cyclized genomes. Each
gRNA chain is categorized as cyclized if its terminal beads are in adjacent lattice positions.
Maximal 5ʹ end-like RNA content in gRNA chains leads to optimal packaging
Our previous work experimentally examined relatively small regions of the genome with regard
to the ability to promote N-protein phase separation. While it was clear that the 5’ and 3’ ends
of the genome were both highly structured and this was associated with LLPS-promoting
activity, it was less definitive that most of the interior of the genome was most similar to FE.
Therefore, we next asked how the total LLPS-promoting content vs. the solubilizing RNA
content altered N-protein phase separation and genome packaging. We created gRNA chains
composed entirely of either 5ʹ end-like beads or FE-like beads (Fig 4A). We found that a
genome of purely 5ʹ end-like beads led to greatly enhanced phase separation of N-protein (Fig
4B), robust gRNA compaction below the equal volume fraction contour (Fig 4C), and nearly
perfect genome cyclization below the equal volume fraction contour and within the phase
envelope (Fig 4D). In contrast, gRNA composed entirely of FE beads limited single packaging at
high volume fractions of N-protein and gRNA (Fig 4B), led to gRNA expansion for most
conditions (Fig 4C), and did not promote genome cyclization (Fig 4D). It appears that maximal
content of LLPS-promoting sequence is ideal for packaging gRNA by N-protein alone. However,
the genome must encode many features other than optimal binding with N-protein and is thus
constrained to have a limited amount of LLPS-promoting sequence. Given a limited supply of
LLPS-promoting sequence, we next asked what the optimal spatial patterning would be to
promote packaging.

Spatial patterning gRNA mutants can enhance single genome packaging but limit compaction
and prevent genome cyclization
Since the 5¢ and 3¢ ends of the gRNA were both found to promote phase separation with Nprotein, we hypothesized that this spatial arrangement of phase separation-promoting
elements at the ends of the genome may be relevant to packaging. We investigated the
importance of the arrangement of phase separation-promoting sequences on the ends of the
gRNA by designing mutants where these regions are rearranged. We created three mutants, all
of which retain 12 5¢ end-like beads and the anisotropic interaction among their terminal
beads. The 5¢ end-like beads are repositioned either in the middle of the genome (middle),
uniformly throughout (uniform), or on one end (end) (Fig 5A). The phase boundaries of each of
the mutants remain relatively unchanged with respect to the WT system, suggesting that the
total amount and not the spatial patterning of 5¢ end and FE RNA beads determines the bulk
concentrations at which N-protein phase separation occurs (Fig 5). However, we observed
differences in the genome packaging metrics relative to WT and among the mutants.
The uniform and middle gRNA systems are more efficient than WT at packaging single genomes
into clusters, and end gRNA behaves similarly to WT (Fig 5B). Thus, it appears that dispersed or
centrally located phase separating elements within the gRNA are preferred for single genome
packaging by N-protein alone. However, uniform gRNA does not significantly compact upon
phase separation, while middle and end gRNA compact similarly to WT, suggesting that
sufficiently clustered LLPS-promoting sequences are important for compaction (Fig 5C).
Given the positioning of the wildtype LLPS-promoting sequences at the ends of the genome, we
postulated that rearrangement of the location of these sequences would have the strongest
impact on genome cyclization. To this end, we also quantified genome cyclization for these
mutants, and found that none of them were able to cyclize genomes (Fig 5D). Importantly, each
of these systems maintains an intrinsic bonding capability between the terminal beads of its
gRNA chains. However, since the chains are so large, they cannot efficiently locate each other
during the course of the simulation. Thus, the localization of phase separation to the 5¢ and 3¢
ends with N-protein in the WT system is necessary for the positioning of the genome ends for
binding and cyclization (Fig 3E, 5D).

Optimal gRNA design with limited LLPS-promoting sequence
We know from the studies above that increased 5ʹ end-like RNA content enhances all packaging
metrics. With a limited supply, it appears that positioning of these beads at the ends of genome
is essential for cyclization, clustered beads are important for compaction, and uniformly spaced
or centrally located beads can promote single packaging. With this understanding, we
hypothesized that a genome could evolve that would optimally function according to all of
these metrics, given a limited supply of LLPS-promoting beads. We designed a gRNA which has
the WT arrangement at the ends, with 12 additional groups of 3 5¢ end-like beads uniformly
spaced throughout its length (Fig 6A). We found that N-protein phase separation occurs over a
broader range of concentrations, and that all studied genome packaging metrics are enhanced,
relative to WT. Single genome packaging is more preferable within the concave region below
the phase envelope (Fig 6B). Genome compaction is greatly enhanced below the equal Nprotein gRNA volume fraction contour (Fig 6C). Genome cyclization is also enhanced (Fig 6D).

For this optimized gRNA design, there appears to be a concentration regime corresponding to
the concave region below the phase envelope where single genome packaging, compaction,
and cyclization can all occur efficiently. These results raise two predictions concerning the virion
assembly process. First, there exists an optimal concentration range of gRNA and N-protein that
promotes virion assembly. Second, phase-separation promoting gRNA sequences may be
located not only at the 5¢ and 3¢ ends, but also distributed in clusters throughout the genome to
enhance genome packaging.
Discussion
It is clear that protein and RNA elements of SARS-CoV-2 can engage in phase separation with Nprotein (11-15), but the functional consequences of this physical chemistry capacity for viral
replication remain elusive. In this study we sought to explore how the spatial patterning of
phase separation-promoting or -inhibiting RNA elements in the genome could facilitate the
specificity and singularity of packaging the genome. Using coarse-grained simulations rooted in
empirical observations, we find that single genome packaging is most efficient when binding
sites are centrally located or distributed throughout the genome. However, the arrangement of
phase separation promoting sequences in clusters is critical for genome compaction, and the
positioning of these elements at both ends is necessary for cyclization.
Biophysical interpretation of the different protein binding modes leading to opposing phase
behavior
An essential feature of our model is the different binding mode of N-protein with 5¢ end and FE
RNA. We found that weak, isotropic interactions with 5¢ end RNA promote phase separation,
while strong, anisotropic interactions with FE RNA lead to N-protein solubilization. Intrinsically,
the valence of the isotropic interactions is 26 in a cubic lattice, while the valence is 1 for the
anisotropic interactions. Additionally, since the anisotropic interactions have a higher binding
energy than the isotropic ones, they last for longer, which effectively compounds the difference
in valence between the 5¢ end and FE beads. For the FE RNA system, this design allows for more
N-protein binding at lower protein concentrations, but a less significant increase in protein
binding as the protein concentration is increased. On the other hand, 5¢ end RNA experiences a
cooperative binding effect with N-protein, leading to greatly increased protein binding as
protein concentrations are increased. The valence difference between 5¢ end and FE RNA also
includes competition between N-protein-FE RNA binding and N-protein dimerization, since a
single bead in the model is responsible for both interactions. Therefore, while N-protein is
bound to FE RNA, it can no longer dimerize, but while it is bound to 5¢ end RNA, it is free to
dimerize. We suspect that this competition also compounds the cooperative effect of the Nprotein binding to each of these different RNAs and contributes to the distinct behaviors of
these different polymers. The agreement between experimental results and our model suggests

that there may be some underlying differences in the N-protein-RNA interactions in the 5¢ endlike and FE-like regions in the gRNA that lead to distinct protein binding behavior. We
hypothesize that FE-like regions have different N-protein binding kinetics than 5¢ end-like
regions, which will need to be explored experimentally in future work.
Boomerang shape of the phase boundaries
It has been previously reported that phase boundaries in ternary systems that are purely driven
by heterotypic interactions are roughly elliptical in log-log space (16). However, the phase
diagrams of the ternary systems studied in this work have distinct shapes. The 5¢ end RNA with
N-protein phase diagram resembles an elliptical shape combined with a high N-protein
concentration arm that corresponds well to the shape of the FE RNA with N-protein phase
diagram. Each of these high N-protein concentration arms correspond to the N-protein
concentration range where phase separation occurs for N-protein alone at temperature 1 a.u.,
the temperature at which all ternary systems were studied (Fig 1B-D). The same superimposed
shape is even more apparent in the gRNA with N-protein phase diagrams, with N-protein phase
boundaries that resemble boomerangs (Fig 3B-E). We hypothesize that these phase diagrams
arise from the union of two regimes of phase behavior that are driven by distinct forces. The
elliptical portion that extends to low N-protein and RNA concentrations demonstrates phase
separation that is driven by heterotypic interactions between RNA and N-protein, which aligns
with reports in (16). On the other hand, the high concentration N-protein portion of the phase
diagrams indicates phase separation that is driven by N-protein homotypic interactions. Here,
RNA can partition into the dense phase, but it is neither necessary for phase separation, nor is it
the driver. Therefore, the FE RNA with N-protein phase diagram consists only of this high Nprotein concentration regime, which is eventually capped at high enough RNA concentrations
(Fig 1D). As more FE RNA is present to sequester N-protein out of solution, the concentration of
the available pool of N-protein is effectively decreased and phase separation can no longer
occur. For systems with 5¢ end RNA present, the phase diagrams have a complex reentrant
character, passing in and out of the phase separating regime for certain fixed RNA
concentrations as N-protein concentration is changed (Fig 1C, 3B-E). We speculate that this
reentrant behavior is due to the interplay of phase separation driven by heterotypic or
homotypic interactions, with intermediate regimes where neither are strong enough to drive
phase separation. It is interesting to speculate whether such rich phase behavior may exist in
other multicomponent systems, specifically those that involve long nucleotide polymers and
RNA- or DNA-binding proteins.
Compatibility with the single packaging signal model
A recent model of single genome packaging has emerged as part of a study of the SARS-CoV-2
N-protein (13). Results from Cubuk et al. suggests a single packaging signal is much more
efficiently packaged and multiple viruses such as HIV employ this strategy. Our results confirm
this finding in that restriction of LLPS promoting elements to the ends of the genome (Fig 5) is
also not as efficient as single central packaging signal and multiple peppered LLPS promoting
elements in the center (Fig 6). Cubuk et al showed that for a 2-bead representation of N-protein
that experienced isotropic attraction to itself and a long, 61-bead RNA molecule, large phaseseparated clusters would form. However, if a much stronger binding site was added to the

center of the RNA chain, mimicking a hypothetical packaging signal, N-protein and RNA chains
would instead form kinetically trapped clusters that only very slowly coalesced into a single
phase-separated droplet. This model is simpler than the one presented here, but it is
reminiscent of the distinct effects seen here between 5¢ end RNA and FE RNA. In our model, the
most important effective difference between the 5¢ end and FE RNA beads is their valence, with
5¢ end RNA having a much higher valence than FE RNA. The model in (13) includes only a
difference in binding energy, since all beads interact isotropically. However, the higher binding
energy beads have a lower effective valence than the low energy beads at a given timescale,
since they participate in bonds with fewer partners. In line with our results, the presence of
lower-valence binding sites sequesters N-protein into clusters, opposing large-scale phase
separation. Indeed, other groups have shown that a high enough valence is required for phase
separation to occur in silico (25) and in vitro (26). In our model, however, most of the binding
sites on the gRNA are of a low-valence character, which is distinct from the single, low-valence,
packaging signal site in (13). Despite this difference, both models provide evidence that such
low-valence sites are essential for packaging tasks required during virion assembly, and that
runaway phase separation must be tempered via alternative self-assembly pathways.
Why would SARS-CoV-2 and other betacoronaviruses use a relatively inefficient packaging
methodology with LLPS? One possible reason could be that packaging and condensation may be
acting in direct competition with other viral processes such as translation, and N-protein LLPS
may block or slow ribosomal read-through. In line with this hypothesis, Fmr1 LLPS has
previously been demonstrated to repress translation of co-condensing RNA (27). By restricting
LLPS promoting elements to the 5’ and 3’ ends of the genome, SARS-CoV-2 could allow for
efficient packaging while ensuring viral protein production can proceed unencumbered.
The phase behavior of systems with very short and very long chains
For our systems with N-protein and gRNA, we never observed a dilute phase of gRNA and
instead saw that the dense phase of N-protein was condensed on gRNA chains. We hypothesize
that this effect is due to the large size of gRNA and their low abundance (10 chains in
simulations). The Flory-Huggins free energy (28) predicts that as polymer length increases, the
dilute phase volume fraction of that polymer decreases. As chain length increases in a fixed
volume, the expected dilute phase volume fraction will eventually pass below the volume
fraction occupied by a single chain, leading to disappearance of the dilute phase. When a small
number of such large chains are combined with many thousands of shorter chains, an
interesting blend of properties can arise. The shorter chain may still exhibit thermodynamically
well-defined phase separation, although the dense phase now occurs on the long chains which
effectively become a surface upon which phase separation is favored. This situation may be a
relatively common one in biology. For example, within a host cell, the number of SARS-CoV-2
gRNA chains in a volume relevant for N-protein phase separation may not be much more than
the 10 studied here (9). The difference in scale between thousands of proteins and dozens of
very large nucleic acid polymers presents challenges to existing physical frameworks for ternary
phase separation and will require theoretical innovations to rigorously understand.
Generalization to other viruses and systems with long RNAs or DNA

Our models developed here are sufficiently coarse-grained to speculate that they may be
applicable to other viruses and systems that involve long nucleotide chains and proteins.
Components from several viruses have been shown to undergo phase separation, raising the
possibility that spatial patterning of specific LLPS-promoting RNA or DNA sequences may have
evolved to promote optimal genome packaging in other viruses in addition to SARS-CoV-2.
Many cellular phase separated bodies involve long RNAs or DNA and proteins that bind them. A
particularly relevant example for our modeling is paraspeckles. Paraspeckles are highly ordered,
condensed nuclear bodies that require the presence of the long noncoding RNA, NEAT1. NEAT1
was recently shown to contain distinct functional domains, one of which is repetitive in its
sequence and is necessary for paraspeckle formation (29). Paraspeckles also require several
proteins, most of which contain RNA-binding domains and disordered regions (30). Recent work
has shown that the central region of NEAT1 is necessary and sufficient for paraspeckle
formation, and that it initiates assembly by binding several proteins (29). Specifically, the
proteins NONO and SPFQ must first bind NEAT1, dimerize, and promote further polymerization
via coiled-coil domains with other proteins for paraspeckle assembly to continue (30). There are
thus many parallels with the SARS-CoV-2 system studied here; specific spatial patterning of
protein binding elements along the RNAs is essential, and the protein partners must be able to
dimerize/oligomerize for further assembly.
Conclusion
Identification of specific RNA sequences that promote ordered phase separated bodies via
protein binding will not only advance our understanding of viruses, but also the many diverse
cellular bodies and regions that contain long RNAs or DNA.
