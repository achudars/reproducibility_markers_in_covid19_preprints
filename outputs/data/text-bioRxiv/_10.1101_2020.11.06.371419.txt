Abstract

25
26

Expression-dependent, Spike-only vaccines have been developed, deployed, and shown

27

to be effective in the fight against SARS-CoV-2. However, additional approaches to

28

vaccine development may be needed to meet existing and future challenges posed by

29

emerging Spike variant strains, as well as a likely need for different antigen-delivery

30

systems that are safe and effective for regular, periodic re-administration. We report here

31

the development of mRNA-loaded exosomes, demonstrate that they can mediate the

32

functional expression of heterologous proteins in vitro and in vivo, and have fewer

33

adverse effects than comparable doses of lipid nanoparticles. Furthermore, we applied

34

this approach to the development of an exosome-based, multiplexed mRNA vaccine that

35

drives expression of immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid and Spike proteins. This

36

vaccine elicited long-lasting cellular and humoral responses to Nucleocapsid and to

37

Spike, demonstrating that exosome-based mRNA formulations represent a previously

38

unexplored platform in the fight against COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent

51

2012 (Memish et al., 2013), indicative of a generally susceptibility of human populations

52

to coronavirus zoonoses. These zoonoses are more distantly to human endemic

53

betacoronaviruses (OC43, HKU1, etc.) that also cause respiratory infections of milder

54

effect 11). While SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with lower mortality than SARS-CoV

55

or MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 initially displayed a higher rate of transmission, quickly

56

became

Following virus-cell membrane fusion, the viral genomic RNA (gRNA) is translated to

78

their unique protein products. These include a dozen or more additional proteins,

including the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins Nucleocapsid (N), Spike (S), Membrane

25% higher in cells treated with the exo-mRNA formulation than with the LNP-mRNA

pronounced at high-dose administration, as the exo-mRNA-treated cells expressed far

more Antares2 activity than the LNP-exo-treated cells (16-fold; n = 6; p = 0.00035).

141

This large difference in particle-mediated Antares2 expression was caused by a drop in

142

LNP-mRNA-mediated expression, raising the possibility that LNP administration is

143

inhibitory at high levels of administration. This in turn raised the possibility of general

144

toxicity of LNP administration, which we addressed by following the short-term

145

consequences of exosome and LNP injections in mice. Animals were injected (i.m.) with

146

equal numbers of either exosomes or LNPs (50 ml of ??? particles/ml), returned to their

147

cages for three days, and then sacrificed and processed for organ histology by an

148

independent testing laboratory (Fig. 3A). No abnormalities were detected in control

149

animals (5/5) or in animals injected with exosomes (5/5). In contrast, only one of the LNP-

150

injected animals (1/5) displayed normal spleen histology, as 4/5 animals showed an

151

increase in red pulp. Adverse LNP effects may also explain the ~5% reduction in body

152

mass (n = 5; p = 0.05) we observed at 3 days post-injection (Fig. 3B).

153
154

The robust expression of exosome-delivered mRNA in vitro and the absence of exosome-

155

associated adverse effects led us to next test whether RNA-loaded exosomes might also

156

be able to drive Antares2 expression in vivo. Towards this end, we injected adult mice

157

(0.05 ml volume, intramuscular (i.m.) administration) with Antares2 mRNA-loaded

158

exosomes, returned the animals to cages to allow for Antares2 expression. 24 hours later,

159

the control (uninjected) and treated mice were injected (i.p.) with a solution of the

160

Antares2 luciferin DTZ and imaged immediately using a real-time bioluminescent imaging

161

(BLI) system to visualize exosome-mediated, mRNA-directed Antares2 expression.

162

Control animals displayed no significant light emission upon DTZ injections whereas

163

animals that had been injected with the mRNA-loaded exosome formulation displayed

robust light emission (Fig. 3). These observations demonstrate that RNA-loaded

165

exosomes can deliver functional mRNAs into cells in live animals in a way that leads to

166

mRNA translation, protein expression, and directed enzyme activity.

167
168

Design and validation of SW1 and LSNME mRNAs

169

We next tested whether exosome-mRNA formulations can be used to elicit immune

170

responses to mRNA-encoded antigens. Towards this end, we synthesized a pair of

171

mRNAs, one of which expresses the form of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (SW1) encoded by the

172

initial viral isolate 1. The second mRNA expresses a fusion protein (LSNME) comprised

173

of the SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein, as well as fragments of the Spike, Membrane,

174

and Envelope proteins, all inserted in the extracellular domain of human Lamp1 (this

175

Lamp1-based fusion protein aims to induce anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity by targeting viral

176

protein fragments to the MHC Class I and II antigen presentation pathways

177

Transfection of these mRNAs into HEK293 cells (Fig. 4) resulted in expression of Spike

178

at the cell surface but also at internal organelles (shown elsewhere to be lysosomes

boost), and day 42 (2nd boost). Blood (0.1 mL) was collected on days 14, 35, 56, 70 and

188

84. On day 84 the animals were sacrificed to obtain tissue samples for histological

189

analysis and splenocytes for blood cell studies. Using ELISA kits adapted for the detection

190

of mouse antibodies, we observed that vaccinated animals displayed a dose-dependent

191

antibody response to both the SARS-CoV-2 N protein and S protein. These antibody

192

reactions were not particularly robust but they were long-lasting, persisting to 7 weeks

193

after the final boost with little evidence of decline. It should be noted that the modest

194

antibody production was expected in the case of the N protein, as the LSNME mRNA is

195

designed to stimulate cellular immune responses rather than the production of anti-N

196

antibodies.

197
198

LSNME/SW1 vaccination induces cellular immune responses to N and S

199

Vaccinated and control animals were also interrogated for the presence of antigen-

200

reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. This was carried out by collecting splenocytes at the

201

completion of the trial (day 84) using a CFSE proliferation assay in the presence or

202

absence of recombinant N and S proteins. These experiments revealed that vaccination

203

had induced a significant increase in the percentages of CD4+ T-cells and CD8+ T-cells

204

that proliferated in response to addition of either recombinant N protein or recombinant S

205

protein to the culture media (Fig. 6A-D). These vaccine-specific, antigen-induced

206

proliferative responses demonstrate that the LSNME/SW1 vaccine achieved its primary

207

goal, which was to prime the cellular arm of the immune system to generate N-reactive

208

CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and also S-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. In additional

209

experiments, we stained antigen-induced T-cells cells for the expression of interferon

gamma (IFNg) and interleukin 4 (IL4). These experiments revealed that the S-reactive

211

CD4+ T-cell population displayed elevated expression of the Th1-associated cytokine

212

IFNg, and to a lesser extent, the Th2-associated cytokine IL4 (Fig 7). In contrast, N-

213

reactive T-cells failed to display an N-induced expression of either IFNg or IL4.

214
215

Absence of vaccine-induced adverse reactions

216

Control and vaccinated animals were examined regularly for overall appearance, general

217

behavior, and injection site inflammation (redness, swelling). No vaccine-related

218

differences were observed in any of these variables, and animals from all groups

219

displayed similar age-related increases in body mass (supplemental figure 1).

220

Vaccination also had no discernable effect on blood cell counts (supplemental figure 2).

221

Histological analyses were performed on all animals at the conclusion of the study by an

222

independent histology service, which reported that vaccinated animals showed no

223

difference in overall appearance of any of the tissues that were examined. Representative

224

images are presented for brain, lung, heart, liver, spleen, kidney, and side of injection

225

skeletal muscle in an animal from each of the trial groups (Fig. 8).

Discussion

229

Exosomes are natural products of human cells that are more ‘self’ than ‘non-self’. Immune

230

systems are tolerant of the high levels of exosomes that are continuously present in all

231

biofluids (e.g. blood, lymph, cerebrospinal fluid, vitreous, interstitial fluids, etc.)

232

Furthermore, there is no evidence of adverse effects of allogeneic exosome transfer,

233

whether of purified exosomes (from amniotic fluid, blood, etc.) or of inadvertent exosome

234

transfer during tissue transplantation, blood transfusion, plasma injection, etc. In this

235

context, the fact that exosomes normally participate in pathways of vesicle-mediated,

236

intercellular RNA traffic

237

RNA delivery. The data presented here support this hypothesis by showing that that

238

exosome-mRNA formulations can support the in vivo, functional expression of proteins

239

as diverse as soluble cytoplasmic enzymes, viral structural proteins, and synthetic fusion

240

proteins.

59-61

.

indicates that exosomes may be an ideal vehicle for clinical

241
242

Our findings are also relevant to the ongoing battle against SARS-CoV-2. Current vaccine

243

strategies are all centered on inducing immunity to Spike, but Spike-only vaccines are

244

susceptible to escape effects whenever and antigenically shifted Spike variants starts to

245

spread in susceptible populations. While we are developing strategies designed to

246

address this challenge by improved design of expression-dependent Spike vaccines, we

247

are also working to address it by generating a multiplexed mRNA vaccine that delivers

248

two or more mRNAs, one encoding Spike and the others encoding Nucleocapsid and

249

perhaps fragments of other proteins as well. One limitation of this approach is that

250

Nucleocapsid is a cytoplasmic protein rather than a surface antigen, a topology that limits

12

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.06.371419; this version posted March 8, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

251

its efficacy in vaccination studies. However, this limitation can be overcome by expressing

252

Nucleocapsid as part of a fusion with the lysosomal resident protein Lamp1, which places

253

Nucleocapsid protein in the correct compartments for Class I and Class II antigen

254

presentation (ER and lysosome/MHC Class II compartment, respectively). This approach

255

was realized in our LSNME/SW1 vaccine, which elicited strong cellular immune responses

256

to Nucleocapsid as well as to Spike. Vaccinated animals displayed antigen-induced CD4+

257

and CD8+ T-cell responses to both Nucleocapsid and to Spike that persisted for nearly

258

two months after immunization. Furthermore, when these cell populations were

259

interrogated for antigen-induced expression of the cytokines IFNg and IL4, we detected

260

elevated expression of IFNg in CD4+ T-cells exposed to exogenous Spike protein, as well

261

as a more modest Spike-induced expression of IL4. These results raise the possibility

262

that the exosome-based LSNME/SW1 vaccine induces the kind of Th1-skewed cellular

263

immune response desired for an anti-viral vaccine. Vaccinated animals also developed

264

durable antibody responses to the Nucleocapsid and the Spike proteins that were

265

sustained at relatively constant levels over the 7 weeks following immunization. This

266

multi-antigen immune response bodes well for this approach in the next generation of

267

SARS-CoV-2 vaccines that will be needed to protect against the emerging array of

268

antigenically distinct SARS-CoV-2 viral strains and their ever-increasing spectrum of

269

Spike protein mutations.

270
271

In conclusion, the results presented in this study validate the use of multiplexed exosome-

272

mRNA formulations for functional delivery of mRNAs both in cultured cells and in live

273

animals. The successful use of exosomes to deliver Antares2 mRNA opens the door to

follow-on studies aimed at optimizing exosome-RNA formulation conditions, as well as

275

for characterizing the time-dependence of Antares2 expression, biodistribution of

276

exosome-mediated RNA expression, injection site effects, and exosome-mediated tissue

277

tropism. As for the future development of exosome-based SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines,

278

we anticipate that follow-on studies will demonstrate multiple advantages of exosome-

279

based delivery, improved antigen designed, and most importantly, improved protective

280

effects that arise from immunization with multiple viral antigens, and particularly

281

Nucleocapsid, which is a main target of anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunity in COVID-19 patients

fact that exosomes can be deployed at high concentrations without adverse effects on

284

cells or animals bodes well for their future use in dosing regimens that require higher-

Methods

289
290

Cell culture

291

293F cells (Gibco, Cat.# 51-0029) were tested for pathogens and found to be free of viral

292

(cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus I and II, Epstein Barr virus, hepatitis B

293

virus, and parvovirus B19), and bacterial (Mycoplasma) contaminants. Cells were

294

maintained in FreeStyle 293 Expression Medium (Gibco, #12338-018) and incubated at

295

37°C in 8% CO2. For exosome production, 293F cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 x

296

10^6 cells/ml in shaker flasks in a volume of ~1/4 the flask volume and grown at a shaking

297

speed of 110 rpm. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium

298

supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.

299
300

Exosome purification

301

293F cells were grown in shaker cultures for a period of three days. Cells and large cell

302

debris were removed by centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 minutes followed by 3000 x g for

303

15 minutes. The resulting supernatant was passed through a 0.22 µm sterile filtration filter

304

unit (Thermo Fisher, #566-0020) to generate a clarified tissue culture supernatant

305

(CTCS). The CTCS was concentrated by centrifugal filtration (Centricon Plus-70, Ultracel-

306

PL Membrane, 100 kDa size exclusion, Millipore Sigma # UFC710008), with ~120 mLs

307

CTCS concentrated to ~0.5 mLs. Concentrated CTCS was then purified by size exclusion

308

chromatography (SEC) in 1x PBS (qEV original columns/35 nm: Izon Science, #SP5),

309

with the exosomes present in each 0.5 mL starting sample eluting in three 0.5 mL

310

fractions. Purified exosomes were reconcentrated using Amicon® Ultra-4 100 kDa cutoff

311

spin columns (#UFC810024). This process yielded a population of exosomes/small EVs

312

that have the expected ultrastructure and size distribution profile of human exosomes and

313

contain the exosomal marker proteins CD9 and CD63 (Fig. 8), at a concentrating effect

314

of ~500-fold, to a final concentration of ~2 x 1012 exosomes/ml, representing an average

315

recovery of 35%.

316
317

Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA)

318

Vesicle concentrations and size distribution profiles of exosome preparations were

319

measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) using a NanoSight NS300 (Malvern

320

Panalytical, United Kingdom) in 1x PBS clarified by filtration through a 0.22 µm sterile

321

filtration unit. Measurements were carried out in triplicates at ambient temperature with

322

fixed camera settings (level of 14, screen gain of 10, detection threshold 3, and

323

temperature of 21.7-22.2 °C). Immunostaining nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) was

324

performed using fluorescently labeled antibody conjugate directed against human CD63

325

(AlexaFluor488-conjugated clone 460305; R&D Systems (Minneapolis, USA)). The

326

fluorescently labeled anti-CD63-antibody (1 µl) was incubated with exosomes (9 µl) for 2

327

hours at room temperature in the dark, then diluted by addition of 1 ml of sterile-filtered

328

PBS (Thermo Fisher, USA) and examined for exosome abundance, size, and CD63

329

immunoreactivity using a Particle Metrix ZetaView® TWIN device. Samples were

330

visualized in scatter mode using the 488 nm laser and standard instrument settings

331

(sensitivity: 80, shutter: 100, min. brightness: 30; min. area: 10; max. area: 1000) in

brightness: 25; min. area: 10; max. area: 1000). The resulting videos were analysed with

334

the ZetaView® software 8.05.10 (Particle Metrix, Germany).

335
336

Immunoblots

337

Exosome and cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE using pre-cast, 4-15% gradient

338

gels (Bio-Rad 4561086) and transferred to PVDF membranes (ThermoFisher, #88518).

339

Membranes were blocked, probed with antibodies directed against CD9 (clone HI9a;

340

BioLegend), CD63 (MX-49.129.5), CD81 (555675; BD Pharmingen), or HSP90 (sc-

341

13119; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), then washed, exposed to HRP-conjugates of goat

342

secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch), washed, and processed for

343

chemiluminescent imaging using HRP-activated chemiluminescence detection solution

344

(Amersham ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents; cat# RPN2106), and imaged

345

using a GE Amersham Imager 600. Images were exported as JPEG files, analyzed using

346

ImageJ software, and processed using Photoshop (Adobe).

347
348

Electron Microscopy and light microscopy

349

Exosomes were fixed by addition of formaldehyde to a final concentration of 4%. Carbon-

350

coated grids were placed on top of a drop of the exosome suspension. Next, grids were

351

placed directly on top of a drop of 2% uranyl acetate. The resulting samples were

352

examined with a Tecnai-12 G2 Spirit Biotwin transmission electron microscope (John

353

Hopkins University, USA). Fluorescence micrographs of Antares2 expression in

354

transfected HEK293 cells were captured as PNG files using an EVOS M7000 microscope

355

equipped with an Olympus UPlanSAPo 40x/0.95 objective.

357

Production of mRNA-loaded exosomes and LNPs

358

mRNAs were obtained from a commercial provider (Trilink). mRNAs were purified using

359

RNeasy columns (Qiagen) and resuspended in DNase-free, RNase-free water using

360

nuclease-free tips and tubes. Purified mRNAs were pre-incubated with a coating of

361

polycationic lipids and then mixed with equal amounts of either purified exosomes or

362

LNPs (DOTAP/DOPE, #F50102, FormuMAx Scientific Inc) at 4oC for 10 minutes.

363

Formulations were either used immediately or frozen at -80oC and thawed rapidly prior to

364

use.

365
366

Luciferase measurements and bioluminescent imaging

367

HEK293 cells were incubated with exosome-mRNA formulations overnight under

368

standard culture conditions. Antares2 luciferase activity was measured by Live cell

369

bioluminescence was collected after incubating with substrate diphenylterazine (MCE,

370

HY-111382) at final concentration of 50 µM for 3 minutes. Readings were collected using

371

a SpectraMax i3x (Molecular Devices). For in vivo studies, thirteen months-old, female

372

Balb/c mice (Jackson Laboratory) housed under pathogen-free conditions at the Cedars-

373

Sinai Medical Center animal facility were used to study the expression of Exosome-

374

Anteres2 mRNA expression 24 hours after injection. Intramuscular injections were at a

375

volume of 50 µls per mouse containing 5 ug mRNA. After 24 hours the animals were

376

imaged using an IVIS Spectrum imager (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) (All animal

377

experimentation was performed following institutional guidelines for animal care and were

Animal experimentation

381

All animal experimentation was performed following institutional guidelines for animal

382

care and were approved by the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center IACUC (#8602). All

383

injections were at a volume of 50 µls. Experiments involved injection of exosomes, LNPS,

384

and Antares2 mRNA-loaded exosomes were performed with BALB/c mice (Jackson

385

Laboratory). Immunization with mRNA-loaded exosomes were performed on thirteen

386

weeks-old, male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory) housed under pathogen-free

387

conditions at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center animal facility. Blood (~0.1 mL) was

388

collected periodically from the orbital vein. At day 84, mice were deeply anesthetized

389

using isoflurane, euthanized by cervical dislocation, and processed using standard

390

surgical procedures to obtain spleen, lung, brain, heart, liver, kidney, muscle, and other

391

tissues. Spleens were processed for splenocyte analysis, and all tissues were processed

392

for histological analysis by fixation in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Histological analysis

393

was performed by the service arm of the HIC/Comparative Pathology Program of the

394

University of Washington.

396

ELISA for SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific antibody responses

397

Mouse IgG antibody production against SARS-CoV-2 antigens was measured by

398

enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). For antigens S1 (RBD) and N, pre-

399

coated ELISA plates from RayBiotech were utilized (IEQ-CoV S RBD-IgG; IEQ-CoVN-

400

coated wells in duplicates and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 2 hours on a

403

shaker (200 rpm). The plates were washed 4 times with wash buffer followed by blocking

404

for 2 hours at RT with 1% BSA in PBS. Mouse antibodies bound to the antigens coated

405

on the ELISA plates were detected using HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary

406

antibodies (Jackson Immuno Research Inc.) Plates were washed 4 times with washing

407

buffer, and developed using TMB substrate (RayBiotech). Microplate Reader was used

408

to measure the absorbance at 650 nm (SpectraMaxID3, Molecular Devices, with SoftMax

409

Pro7 software).

411

Single cell splenocyte preparation

412

After terminal blood collection, mice were euthanized, and part of fresh spleens were

413

harvested. Single cell splenocyte preparation was obtained by machinal passage through

414

a 40 µm nylon cell strainer (BD Falcon, #352340). Erythrocytes were depleted using
