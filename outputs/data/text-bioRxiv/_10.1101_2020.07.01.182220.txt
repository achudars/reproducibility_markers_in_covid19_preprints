Abstract

28

Introduction: Commercially available SARS-CoV-2 serological assays based on

29

different viral antigens have been approved for the qualitative determination of anti-

30

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. However, there is limited published data associating the

31

results from commercial assays with neutralizing antibodies.

32

Methods: 67 specimens from 48 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and a

33

positive result by the Roche Elecsys SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, or

34

EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and 5 control specimens were analyzed for

35

the presence of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Correlation, concordance,

36

positive percent agreement (PPA), and negative percent agreement (NPA) were

37

calculated at several cutoffs. Results were compared in patients categorized by clinical

38

outcomes.

39

Results: The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer (EC50) and the Roche,

40

Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays was 0.29, 0.47, and 0.46 respectively. At an EC50

41

of 1:32, the concordance kappa with Roche was 0.49 (95% CI; 0.23-0.75), with Abbott

42

was 0.52 (0.28-0.77), and with EUROIMMUN was 0.61 (0.4-0.82). At the same

43

neutralizing titer, the PPA and NPA for the Roche was 100% (94-100) & 56% (30-80);

44

Abbott was 96% (88-99) & 69% (44-86); and EUROIMMUN was 91% (80-96) & 81%

45

(57-93) for distinguishing neutralizing antibodies. Patients who died, were intubated,

46

or had a cardiac injury from COVID-19 infection had significantly higher neutralizing

47

titers relative to those with mild symptoms.

48

Conclusion: COVID-19 patients generate an antibody response to multiple viral

49

proteins such that the calibrator ratios on the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN assays

50

are all associated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Nevertheless, commercial

serological assays have poor NPA for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, making them

52

imperfect proxies for neutralization.

INTRODUCTION

55

Host cell infections by the recently-emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome

56

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) begin when the viral spike (S) protein engages the host

57

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (1). The humoral immune response

58

can block infection through neutralizing antibodies, which bind the virus in a manner

59

that prevents host cell infection (2). For SARS-CoV-2, this may be achieved by

60

interfering with the spike -ACE2 receptor interaction, or by disrupting the fusion

61

mechanisms the virus uses to enter host cell cytoplasm (2).

62
63

In the absence of a vaccine, there is considerable interest in identifying high-affinity

64

neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to assess immune status and to evaluate

65

vaccine responses. We previously demonstrated that passive transfer of monoclonal

66

antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 S protein reduced viral titers and pathology in the

67

lungs in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 (3). Monoclonal antibodies engineered from

68

neutralizing antibodies, initially identified from convalescent COVID-19 patients, have

69

been advanced as potential antiviral therapeutics (4-6), and early results from

70

convalescent plasma use in patients indicate a protective effect of antibodies against

71

SARS-CoV-2 (7-10). While early results are promising, the antibody titer conferring

72

protection remains unclear and the role of neutralizing antibodies in protection has not

73

been fully elucidated (11).

75

Despite widespread interest in neutralizing antibodies, methods for their detection and

76

quantification are relatively low-throughput and limited to Biosafety Level 3-equipped

77

research laboratories. While high-throughput methods have emerged, most rely on

78

recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Viruses (VSV) engineered to express a portion of the

79

SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein, and their subsequent entry into cell lines (12-14).

80

Commercially available serological assays are high-throughput, relatively inexpensive,

81

and use readily available instrumentation. The use of automated serological SARS-

82

CoV-2 assays as a surrogate for neutralizing titers is therefore an attractive option. To

83

date, limited data are available correlating commercially available assays with the

84

presence of neutralizing antibodies.

85
86

We previously compared the clinical performance of three commercial serological

87

assays (15, 16). Here, we further assess the ability of these assays to predict the presence

88

of neutralizing antibodies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

91
92

Specimens: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Washington

93

University in St. Louis. Residual plasma from physician-ordered complete blood count

94

were utilized. Specimens were obtained from patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19

95

and at least one previously positive SARS-CoV-2 serological result. A subset of pre-

96

pandemic samples obtained in 2015 and stored at -80 ºC were used as negative controls.

97
98

Clinical information: Duration from symptom onset was obtained from two

99

independent assessors by review of the electronic medical record (EMR) and inferred

from physician encounter notes. Symptoms included cough, fever, shortness of breath,

101

loss of taste or smell, sore throat, and headache (17). The EMR also was used to collect

102

data on outcomes for each patient. Mortality and intubation were determined by

103

physician encounter notes, acute kidney injury (AKI) was defined using RIFLE criteria

104

of 2-fold increase in serum creatinine and urine output less than 5 mL/kg/hr, cardiac

105

injury was defined as a troponin I concentration > 0.03 ng/mL (Abbott Diagnostics).

106
107

INSTRUMENTATION: Specimens were analyzed on three commercially available

108

immunoassays and reported previously (15, 16). The Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-

109

2 assay was performed on an a Cobas e 601. The Roche assay detects total antibodies

110

(IgG, IgA, IgM) against an epitope of the viral nucleocapsid protein. The Abbott SARS-

111

CoV-2 IgG assay was performed on an i2000 Abbott Architect (Abbott Diagnostics)

112

and detects IgG antibodies against the viral nucleocapsid protein. The EUROIMMUN

113

(EI) SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay was performed on a QUANTA-Lyser 240 (Inova

114

Diagnostics) assay and detects anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG directed against the S1 domain

115

of viral spike protein. All three assays use an assay-specific calibrator to report the ratio

116

of the signal from the specimen to the signal of the calibrator. The results are interpreted

117

as positive or negative relative to a threshold value. For the Roche assay, a positive is

118

a cutoff index (COI) ³1; for the Abbott assay, a signal to cut-off (S/CO) ³1.4 is positive

119

and <1.4 is negative; for the EI assay, a ratio

120

indeterminate, and < 0.8 is negative. The cutoff of 1.2 was used as a positive result for

121

the EI. All three assays specify a positive result as the signal of the sample/the signal

122

of a calibrator, therefore all results are reported here as a ratio.

FOCUS REDUCTION NEUTRALIZATION ASSAYS: Neutralization assays were

125

performed as previously described (18). Briefly, SARS-CoV-2 strain 2019 n-

126

CoV/USA_WA1/2020 was obtained from the Centers of Disease Control and passaged

127

in Vero E6 cells with DMEM (Corning) supplemented with glucose, L-glutamine,

128

sodium pyruvate, and 10% FBS. Indicated dilutions of plasma were incubated with 102

129

focus forming units (FFU) of SARS-CoV-2 for 1h at 37°C before addition of the

130

antibody virus complex to Vero E6 monolayers at 37°C for 1h. Cells were overlaid with

131

a 1% w/v methylcellulose in MEM supplemented with 2% FBS and harvested 30h later.

132

Methylcellulose overlays were removed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS

133

at room temperature. Plates were then washed and incubated with 1 µg/mL anti-S

134

antibody (CR3022) (19) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-Human IgG. Cells infected by

135

SARS-CoV-2 were visualized using TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL) and cell foci

136

were quantified using an ImmunoSpot microanalyzer (Cellular Technologies). For each

137

specimen, a minimum of 8 dilutions of human plasma were performed in duplicate and

138

a standard curve generated. The 1/Log10 plasma dilution (EC50) is the dilution at which

139

50% of the cells were infected with virus and formed foci (Supplemental Figure 1).

140
141

STATISTICS: Correlation between clinical assays and neutralizing titers were

142

calculated using linear regression. Concordance between the assays was calculated

143

using Cohen’s Kappa. Area under the curve (AUC) for receiver operator characteristic

144

(ROC) curves were calculated using the Wilson/Brown method. Kappa, positive

145

percent agreement (PPA), and negative percent agreement (NPA) analysis were

146

performed using multiple cutoffs for neutralizing titers owing to a lack of consensus

147

regarding the relevant protective titer. Differences between antibody and neutralizing

148

titers categorized by outcomes were calculated using unpaired T-tests. For outcome

RESULTS

153

40/42 specimens from PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients with positive antibody

154

results from commercial SARS-CoV-2 assays had neutralizing titers >1:20 by d14 post-

155

symptom onset (Figure 1A). The mean neutralizing titer by d21 was 1:250 (95% CI;

156

1:149- 1:436). In contrast, pre-pandemic control samples were not neutralizing at a titer

157

of 1:20. Neutralizing titers increased subsequently with days post-symptom onset

158

(Supplemental Figure 2). A subset of patients with serial measurements demonstrated

159

a rapid rise in neutralizing titers between d5-15 that plateaued ~1:250 and remained

160

elevated through the time course tested (Figure 1B).

161
162

The correlation of the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing titer with the ratio reported by the

163

Roche, Abbott, and EI assays was 0.29, 0.47, and 0.46 respectively (Figure 2A-C).

164

Higher neutralizing titers were generally associated with a higher ratio as measured by

165

all three assays. At a cutoff of 1:32 for the neutralizing assay, the concordance kappa

166

with Roche was 0.61 (95% CI; 0.35-0.86), with Abbott was 0.65 (0.42-0.88), and with

167

EI was 0.69 (0.49-0.89). For all three assays, the concordance decreased with an

168

increased threshold for neutralizing titers.

169
170

ROC curves to determine the PPA and NPA of a positive antibody result on commercial

171

assays for neutralizing titers ≥ 1:32 revealed an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI; 0.88-1.0), 0.89

172

(0.79-0.99), and 0.93 (0.87-0.99) for the Roche, Abbott and EI assays respectively

173

(Figure 3A). For both the Roche and Abbott assays, the ratio established by the

manufacturers produced maximum PPA with decreased NPA for neutralizing

175

antibodies. Lowering the cutoff for EI increased the PPA without negatively impacting

176

NPA. When evaluated for a neutralizing titer of 1:128, the AUC of the Roche assay

177

was 0.86 (95% CI;0.77-0.95), for the Abbott was 0.82 (0.71-0.94), and for the EI was

178

0.9 (0.83-0.97) (Figure 3B). At this neutralizing titer, the manufacturers’ ratios for a

179

positive result for all three assays maximized PPA while reducing NPA for anti-SARS-

180

CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies.

181
182

At a neutralizing titer of 1:32, the PPA and NPA for the Roche assay was 100% (95%

183

CI; 94-100) and 56% (30-80) at a ratio of 1.0 (Table 1). The ratio for each assay that

184

improved the NPA while minimally affecting the PPA was assessed. The NPA

185

improved to 81% (54-96) with the same PPA if the ratio for a positive result on the

186

Roche was increased to 2.1. For the Abbott assay, the PPA was 96% (88-99) and the

187

NPA was 69% (44-86) at a ratio of 1.4. The PPA and NPA for the Abbott changed to

188

95% (85-99) and 88% (65-96) respectively if the ratio for a positive result was adjusted

189

to 2.2. For the EI assay, the PPA was 91% (80-96) and the NPA was 81% (57-93) at a

190

cutoff of 1.2. By decreasing the ratio for a positive result to 0.72, the PPA improved to

191

96% (88-99) without effecting the NPA. NPA decreased for all three assays with

192

increasing cutoff for a protective titer. To achieve an NPA >70% for all three assays at

193

a neutralizing titer of 1:128, the ratio for a positive result would be 13.0 for the Roche,

194

4.8 for the Abbott, and 2.4 for the EI assays. PPA remained above 80% for all assays

195

at these cutoffs.

196
197

Patients that died as a result of COVID-19 had higher neutralizing antibody titers

198

(mean, 1:576) compared to patients that survived (mean, 1:162) (Figure 4A). In

contrast, no significant difference in ratio was observed between patients that died from

200

COVID-19 compared to those that survived using the Roche, Abbott, or EI assays.

201

Increased neutralizing antibody titers were also higher in patients that were intubated,

202

had cardiac injury, or AKI relative to those with milder COVID-19 symptoms (Figure

203

4B-D). In contrast, no significant differences were noted between the groups regardless

204

of outcomes when using the Roche, Abbott, and EI assays. However, similar non-

205

significant trends (i.e., increase in ratio) were observed in patients who were intubated,

206

had cardiac injury, or AKI with the EI assay. Neutralizing titers trended higher in male

207

patients and patients >60 years old, although this was not statistically significant.

208

Similar trends were observed with the serology assay ratios as well (Supplemental

209

Figure 3). If categorized by low (<1:256) or high neutralizing titers (>1:256), there

210

were no significant differences in outcomes between patients. However, there was an

211

increase in the ratio observed in high neutralizing titer patients (6.3, 95% CI; 5.7-6.9)

212

compared to low titer patients (5.1, 95% CI; 4.1-6.1) on the Abbott assay and the EI

213

assay (8.2, 7.1-9.2 vs. 6.1, 4.6-7.6) (Supplemental Table 1). A similar, but non-

214

significant trend was observed with the Roche assay.

DISCUSSION

217

The emergence of commercially available serological assays for the detection of

218

antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 has outpaced scientific understanding of their

219

immunological meaning and their value in clinical decision making. Here, we assessed

220

the utility of three commercially available clinical assays for correlation with

221

neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We observed modest correlation, but poor

222

concordance and NPA between the Roche, Abbott and EI SARS-CoV-2 assays for the

223

detection of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Interestingly, the three commercial

Tang 10
224

assays demonstrated similar performance with modest correlation but poor

225

concordance and NPA for the detection of neutralizing antibody titers. Several studies

226

have demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies are primarily against the S1, S2, and

227

RBD domains of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (3, 4). As a result, clinical assays

228

targeting these regions have been hypothesized to better predict neutralizing titers.

229

However, our findings indicate that the Roche (nucleocapsid), Abbott (nucleocapsid),

230

and EI (S1) assays have similar performance for identifying patients with neutralizing

231

antibodies. This implies that patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop a broad-

232

based antibody repertoire against multiple proteins and epitopes, with a relatively fixed

233

proportion of those acting as neutralizing antibodies.

234
235

While the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control

236

(CDC) have advised against associating immunity with seropositivity (20, 21), some

237

have proposed that this warning is unnecessarily conservative (22). Our findings

238

suggest that SARS-CoV-2 serological assays should be interpreted with caution. While

239

the majority of patients with antibodies detected by commercial assays had neutralizing

240

antibodies present by d14 post-onset of symptoms, ~10% of patients past d14 had titers

241

that were <1:32. This implies that some patients with previous SARS-CoV-2 infections

242

and positive antibody results by commercial assays may have neutralizing antibodies

243

near the cutoff for a positive result. Although further studies are warranted, these low

244

titers may be inadequate for protection, particularly if neutralizing antibodies are the

245

primary therapeutic benefit of convalescent plasma. While higher reported ratios from

246

all three commercial assays correlated with higher neutralizing titers, this was not

247

universally true. Consistent with this, the correlation between neutralizing titers and

248

serological results were <0.5 on all three commercial assays. These findings are

249

consistent with a previous study demonstrating modest linear correlation between

250

neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 titers with anti-RBD IgG or anti-S IgG using laboratory

251

developed ELISAs (23). Nonetheless, we found that higher ratios reported by all three

252

commercial assays was associated with higher neutralizing titers. Importantly, all three

253

serological assays used in this study currently have Emergency Use Authorization

254

(EUA) to qualitatively determine the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.

255

While a negative result on SARS-CoV-2 serological assays is likely to be associated

256

with the absence of neutralizing antibody titers, a positive result is not reliable for

257

predicting the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Furthermore, since these assays are

258

under the EUA, they cannot be modified by the laboratory to report quantitative units.

259

Our results argue for a potential utility in reporting the ratio calculated for commercially

260

available assays relative to the calibrator. We, along with others, have previously

261

suggested that commercially available serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 may have

262

utility for identifying convalescent plasma donors (24, 25). To this end, reporting

263

quantitative units is more likely to identify convalescent patients with higher

264

neutralizing antibody titers than qualitative cutoffs. Furthermore, if neutralizing

265

antibodies are shown to confer protection to SARS-CoV-2, quantitative serological

266

assays may assist in identifying neutralizing titers in mildly symptomatic and

267

asymptomatic populations. However, further studies are needed to demonstrate the

268

clinical benefit of this approach, especially by characterizing this association in a more

269

diverse patient population.

270
271

While the NPA for neutralizing antibodies was >90% for all three commercial assays,

272

this was only when a 1:20 neutralizing titer was used as a cutoff. It is important to note

273

that this is far below the FDA recommended neutralizing titer for convalescent plasma

Tang 12
274

donors (≥1:160) (26). At a similar cutoff of 1:128, the NPA for neutralizing titers was

275

below 60% for all three of the assays. Furthermore, while it is expected that neutralizing

276

antibodies confer some protection against SARS-CoV-2, the titer required for this

277

protective effect has not been established (11). Due to the low sensitivity of serological

278

assays for diagnosing early SARS-CoV-2 infection (15, 27), some studies have

279

suggested lowering the assay cutoff ratios to improve sensitivity (28, 29). However, if

280

the intended utility of serology is to determine the presence of neutralizing antibodies,

281

our ROC analyses suggest that the assay cutoff should be increased to improve the

282

NPA. Interestingly, some manufacturers are now associating positive serological

283

results with neutralizing antibodies in their validation studies. For instance, the

284

LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay claims high agreement with neutralizing

285

antibodies. However, the cutoff titer used for the neutralizing assay was 1:40; far below

286

that recommended by FDA for convalescent plasma therapy (13). If neutralizing

287

antibodies >1:256 are required for protection, then commercial assays at the current

288

cutoffs may have limited utility for identifying patients with protective antibodies; with

289

NPA between 18-40% for the assays tested in this study.

290
291

Here, we observed that higher neutralizing titers are associated with worse clinical

292

outcomes, a finding that was not observed with commercial serological assays. While

293

seemingly counterintuitive, it is consistent with previous literature and may be a result

294

of higher antigen burdens or hyperactive immune responses among other reasons (30-

295

34). A study of service members in the US Navy with predominantly mild symptoms

296

revealed that ~40% of those with a positive ELISA by the CDC assay had no

297

neutralizing titers at a cutoff of 1:40 (35). Similarly, a recent study demonstrated

298

neutralizing titers at <1:50 in 33% of recovered patients and below 1:1000 in 79% of

patients (23). Our findings are also consistent with a study assessing the agreement

300

between the EI IgG result and neutralizing titers on predominantly non-hospitalized

301

convalescent plasma donors (33). The authors demonstrated that at a neutralizing titer

302

of 1:320, the PPA and NPA were 96% and 32% respectively and that neutralizing titers

303

were higher in a small cohort of hospitalized patients. Similarly, we demonstrate higher

304

neutralizing titers among patients with worse outcomes in an almost entirely

305

hospitalized cohort. Unique to this study, we also compare commercial tests head-to-

306

head and, by extension, compare serologies to two different protein antigens with

307

similar results. Taken together, previous studies coupled with the findings presented

308

here are consistent with the notion that neutralizing antibodies, while an important

309

component of the immune response, (3, 4) are unlikely to be the only mechanism of

310

SARS-CoV-2 clearance and protection. Other immune responses such as cellular

311

immunity, T cells, antibody mediated cellular immunity and antibody mediated

312

complement fixation likely play a pivotal role in protection from SARS-CoV-2.

313
314

Due to both heavy marketing and misunderstanding of their utility, patients have sought

315

antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 to determine if they had been previously infected

316

and for peace-of-mind, assuming that they may have some level of protection (the

317

concept of an “immunity passport”). At our institution, ~85% of the SARS-CoV-2

318

serological tests are performed in the outpatient setting. This implies that the vast

319

majority of these tests may be performed on mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic

320

populations. Therefore, it is crucial that future studies address the correlation between

321

neutralizing titers and commercial assays in the mildly symptomatic and the

322

asymptomatic COVID-19 population. If symptomatic and severely ill patients have the

323

highest titers of neutralizing antibodies, low concordance demonstrated here may be

exacerbated by including asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients. Furthermore,

325

while neutralizing titers appear to persist in the small group of patients with longitudinal

326

specimens, the duration of follow up in our study was too short to determine the

327

durability of neutralizing antibodies. Nonetheless, previous studies have demonstrated

328

a reduction in neutralizing titers after 8 weeks post-hospital discharge (31).

329
330

There are several limitations associated with this study. The true sensitivity and

331

specificity of neutralizing titers in PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients

332

could not be accurately determined because specimens were pre-selected for serological

333

positivity by commercially available immunoassays. This approach was chosen given

334

the highly manual nature of testing for neutralizing antibodies and the primary goal of

335

comparing neutralizing antibody titers to commercial assays. Furthermore, while the

336

neutralizing assay utilized is robust and reproducible, it has not been validated for

337

clinical use. In contrast to other studies, this assay uses an infectious strain of SARS-

338

CoV-2 as opposed to pseudotyped rhabodoviruses or lentiviruses that heterologously

339

express the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Furthermore, the relatively small number of

340

patients tested means that potentially subtle differences in PPA, NPA, and concordance

341

between the three assays could not be distinguished as a result of wide, overlapping

342

confidence intervals. Finally, while others have demonstrated that neutralizing titers

343

appear as early as d10 post-onset of symptoms, it is possible that assessing patients at

344

later time points (i.e., d28) would reveal a higher concordance. While the majority of

345

patients tested serially had neutralizing titers that peaked by d14-15, future studies are

346

needed at later timepoints to correlation with commercial assays at later timepoints.

347

This includes several months after infection, when other studies have demonstrated the

348

neutralizing response beginning to diminish.

In conclusion, our findings suggest that positive serological results by three

351

commercially available assays that measure antibodies against the viral spike or

352

nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 have modest correlation with neutralizing

353

antibody titers. COVID-19 patients generate an antibody response to multiple viral

354

proteins such that the quantitative ratios on the Roche, Abbott, and EUROIMMUN

355

assays have comparable associations with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Nevertheless,

356

commercial serological assays have poor NPA for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, making

357

them imperfect proxies for neutralization.
