Abstract.

20

Coiled-coil (CC) dimer-forming peptides are attractive designable modules for mediating protein association.

21

Highly stable CCs are desired for biological activity regulation and assay. Here, we report the design and versatile

22

applications of orthogonal CC dimer-forming peptides with a dissociation constant in the low nanomolar range.

23

In vitro stability and specificity was confirmed in mammalian cells by enzyme reconstitution, transcriptional

24

activation using a combination of DNA-binding and a transcriptional activation domain, and cellular-enzyme-

25

activity regulation based on externally-added peptides. In addition to cellular regulation, coiled-coil-mediated

26

reporter reconstitution was used for the detection of cell fusion mediated by the interaction between the spike

27

protein of pandemic SARS-CoV2 and the ACE2 receptor. This assay can be used to investigate the mechanism

28

and screen inhibition of viral spike protein-mediated fusion under the biosafety level 1conditions.

Introduction

2

The coiled-coil (CC) motif, ubiquitous in natural proteins, is characterized by the relatively well-defined assembly

3

and specificity rules and is highly attractive as a building block for designing and developing novel polypeptide

4

scaffolds 1, functional proteins 2–5, and as a regulator of protein-protein interactions 6–8. CC protein origami (CCPO)

5

cages 9,10, polymer–peptide hydrogels, nanoparticles, and peptide fibers 11 are fine demonstrations of the utility of

6

CCs for engineering new polypeptide nanostructures. The specificity of CC pairs has been harnessed in order to

7

develop logic circuits and controllers, as well as mammalian cell engineering 4,12, however different applications,

8

require different CC stabilities 13–18.

9
10

Since the stabilities of several previously-designed four-heptad long CC pairs either had low orthogonality to other

11

proteins (e.g., E/K pair 13) or were only moderately stable 16,19, we sought to design a set of highly stable orthogonal

12

parallel heterodimeric CCs that could improve the sensitivity and increase the range of existing or prospective

13

biological applications.

14
15

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is currently among the most acute problems of

16

humanity20, and investigation of its function and discovery of inhibitors command the attention of many scientists.

17

The enveloped SARS-CoV-2 viruses require fusion of viral and cellular membranes in order to infect host cells21.

18

The membrane fusion process is assisted by viral fusion proteins located at the viral envelope. After binding of

19

viral fusion proteins to the receptor at the host cell membrane, a structural rearrangement of the viral fusion protein

20

lowers the energetic barrier of the coalescence of the two biological membranes and the introduction of the viral

21

genome into the cytosol occurs 22. Multiple methods are used for the evaluation of the viral entry and alternative

22

steps of this process 23, from active virus to pseudotyped virus (a.k.a. pseudovirus) infection, which require BSL-

23

2 or BSL-3 labs in order to prevent the danger of infection. Alternatively, cell-cell fusion assays can be used,

24

based on the formation of syncytia between cells that express viral fusion (spike) proteins and the cellular receptors

25

(ACE2) on other cells, offering a safer, virus-free alternative for viral entry studies and the development of antiviral

26

drugs. Syncytium formation has been traditionally analyzed by slow and semi-quantifiable microscopy

27

Generation of a signal, which occurs only after the fusion between donor and acceptor cells 27, provides a good

28

basis for this sensitive method to monitor syncytium formation. Therefore, split fluorescence or luminescence

29

proteins linked to synthetic dimerization domains that form very stable dimers would be a prime choice as

30

reporters.

24–26

.

31
32

In order to generate a set of CC heterodimers with the high thermodynamic stability necessary for new biological

33

applications, we built on a previously published orthogonal NICP CC set 17 but increased the stability of the peptide

34

pairs by reducing the number of asparagine (Asn, N) residues

35

16

noncontact b, c, and f positions . CC pairs were able to reconstitute a split reporter enzyme, and we additionally

36

demonstrate that their activity could be regulated externally by the addition of peptides to cells. Similar to the split

28,29

and modifying amino-acid residues at the

1

reporter reconstitution, we also demonstrated reconstitution of a CC split transcription factor. Moreover, we sought

2

to employ the designed CC pairs in monitoring membrane fusion based on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2

3

spike protein and ACE2 receptor interactions. This sensitive syncytium formation assay can be used to monitor

4

the fusion process and screen for inhibitors in a safe and easy-to-employ way.

De novo designed orthogonal heterodimeric CC pairs with high stability

N5–N8) expected to form two orthogonal CC pairs in a parallel orientation with a high binding affinity (Table 1,

10

N-variants; a CC N7:N8 structural model is depicted in Fig S1A). While Asparagine–Asparagine (Asn–Asn)

11

pairing at the a positions is important for ensuring interaction specificity and peptide orientation 13, it contributes

12

unfavorably to the affinity 28,30. Therefore, in order to increase the affinity of the NICP set, we maintained only a

13

single Asn–Asn interaction per CC pair. The Asn (N) residue was placed at the a position in the third heptad for

14

peptides N5 and N6 and in the second heptad for peptides N7 and N8 to ensure their mutual orthogonality. All

15

other a positions were occupied by isoleucine (Ile, I), whereas leucine (Leu, L) was placed at the d position in all

16

heptad repeats. Given that the residues at the surface-exposed positions do not contribute to the pairing interactions

17

18

helical propensity and, consequently, increase CC stability. In order to ensure orthogonality, lysine (Lys, K) and

19

glutamic acid (Glu, E) were positioned at the e and g positions, obtaining peptide pairs with a unique electrostatic

20

motif that should promote the formation of two CC heterodimers named N5:N6 and N7:N8—both in parallel

21

orientations. The electrostatic motifs of these N-type peptides were kept similar to those of the previously

22

published NICP P-type peptides (P5–P8) 17 (Table 1, Table S1). The interaction pattern of the designed set was

23

evaluated by the scoring function 31, supporting the favorable formation of N5:N6 and N7:N8 CCs (Fig S1B).

Following peptide design, thermal stability and orthogonality of synthetic N-type peptides were analyzed. The

2

secondary structure and stability of peptides were probed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The designed

3

peptide pairs, N5:N6 and N7:N8, were orthogonal to each other (Fig 1E), with the characteristic α-helical CD

4

spectra, Tm above 70 ºC (Fig 1A), and a dissociation constant determined by the ITC (KdITC) in the low nanomolar

5

range (1–15 nM; Fig 1B). In addition, size-exclusion chromatography coupled to static light scattering (SEC-

6

MALS) analysis showed that the equimolar mixture of peptides preferentially formed heterodimers (Fig S2B);

7

however, all four individual N-peptides were α-helical at 20 ºC (Fig S2A). The melting curves of peptides were

8

sigmoidal with a Tm midpoint between 37 ºC and 55 ºC (Fig 1A). Analysis by SEC-MALS confirmed the

9

homodimeric formation of all peptides in solution (Fig S2B).

10
11

In order to tune the stability of designed CCs and avoid homodimerization, we designed additional PA peptide

12

pairs. The Ile residues at the a positions of the first or fourth heptad were replaced with Asn, resulting in peptide

13

variants named P5A:P6A and P7A:P8A (PA peptides), respectively (Table 1; the structural model of P7A:P8A is

14

depicted in Fig S1A). While the inclusion of an additional Asn residue destabilized the hydrophobic core 28–30, it

15

also led to a decrease in the predicted helicity; thus, negatively contributing to the CC formation as confirmed

16

experimentally. The CD spectra and thermal denaturation scans of the individual peptides showed that the second

17

Asn within the PA peptide decreased their α-helical and thermal stability (Fig S2C). Furthermore, in contrast to

18

the N variants, the individual PA peptides were present in solution in a monomeric state and formed dimers only

19

when mixed with their cognate peptide, as shown by SEC-MALS analysis (Fig S2D). The Tm values of the

20

P7A:P8A and P5A:P6A CC pairs were 64 ºC and 57 ºC, respectively (Fig 1C). The ITC-measured Kd value was

21

in the nanomolar range (Fig 1D). The orthogonality of PA peptides was confirmed by measuring the stability of

22

all combinations of PA and N-type peptides (Fig S2E). The expected cognate peptide pairs exhibited higher Tm

23

values than any other combination of peptides, indicating the preference of the peptides to bind to their designated

24

partners.

26

Heterodimeric CC pairs in mammalian cells for reconstitution of enzymatic activity

27

Characterization of CC pairs in vitro provided essential information about their stability. Next, the impact of a

28

cellular environment on the formation of CCs between the cognate peptides was tested by the reconstitution of a

29

split luciferase reporter in mammalian cells (scheme Fig 1F). The N- and C-terminal segments of split luciferase

30

(henceforth, nLuc and cLuc, respectively) were genetically tethered to the N- and C- termini of the N8 and N7

31

peptides, respectively. All four combinations of CC–split luciferase reconstituted enzymatic activity in HEK293

32

cells (Fig 1G, Fig S3A). The highest activity was measured for the CC–split luciferases linked to the N-termini of

33

cognate CC peptides; therefore, this setup was used for further experiments.

34
35

After establishing the most efficient setup of the CC-split luciferase, we analyzed the efficiency of CC formation

36

for newly designed N-peptides (N5:N6 and N7:N8) and compared those with the PA-peptides (P5A:P6A and

P7A:P8A; Fig 1H, Fig 1I). Both the N- and PA-peptide pairs reconstituted the CC-split luciferase; however,

2

reconstitution of the PA-CC-split luciferases was less effective than the N-CC-split luciferase, which corroborated

3

the in vitro stability results of the CC peptides’ stability, regardless of the homodimerization propensity of the N

4

peptides. The orthogonality of all eight peptides was also tested in mammalian cells. In accordance with in vitro

5

results, the nLuc:N6 paired only with cLuc:N5 or P5A but not with cLuc:N7 or P7A, and nLuc:N8 paired with

6

cLuc:N7 and P7A (Fig 1J). The reconstitution of N-CC-split luciferase was more efficient compared to PA-CC-

7

split luciferase, as reflected by the in vitro thermal stability of N- and PA-CCs, which makes N-type peptides very

8

suitable for biological applications. While CD-based thermal denaturation and SEC-MALS cannot discriminate

9

between the homo- and hetero-dimeric CCs, the reconstitution of CC–split proteins depends on the formation of

10

CC heterodimers 3 and, therefore, confirms the heterodimerization of CC pairs.

Tunable stability of CC pairs for biological applications

6

We have previously designed and reported an orthogonal, parallel NICP set of CC heterodimers 17 that contain the

7

same electrostatic motifs as the N- and PA-peptides. Pairing CC-forming peptides with complementary

8

electrostatic motifs (EKEK:KEKE and EKKE:KEEK at e and g positions) but different helical propensities at non-

9

interacting b, c, and f heptad positions allows for facile fine-tuning of the stability of the resulting CC combinations

10

16

11

of pairs with different stabilities. Using the CC-split luciferase assay described above (Fig 1F), we analyzed the

12

formation of N-peptides in combination with the P-peptides with a complementary electrostatic motif. NLuc was

13

genetically tethered to the N-termini of the N8 or N6 peptide, and cLuc to N7, P7A, P7, P7SN, N5, P5A, P5, or

14

P5SN peptide (Fig 2A, Fig 2B). The interaction matrix of all electrostatically complementary peptide

15

combinations predicted the formation of CCs with a range of stability profiles, which were validated

16

experimentally by thermal denaturation scans (Fig S4A, Fig S4B). The stability of CCs formed with the cognate

17

N- and P-peptide pairs (Tm 43–68 ºC) was lower compared to the N-type (Tm > 70 ºC). We also investigated

18

whether the stability of the cognate CC peptides with different helical propensities, determined in vitro, correlated

19

with the reconstitution efficacy of CC-split luciferase in mammalian cells. The highest luciferase activity was

20

determined for the combination of nLuc:N8 with cLuc:N7 and nLuc:N6 with cLuc:N5 (Fig 2A, Fig 2B; for CC-

21

split luciferase see Fig S3B). In contrast, the CC-split luciferase combination, nLuc:N with cLuc:PSN pairs,

22

generated the weakest signal. The results indicate that CC–split luciferase, as a reporter of CC stability in cells,

23

adequately reflects the CC stability determined in vitro. As predicted, only orthogonal peptide variants with

24

complementary electrostatic motifs reconstituted the functional luciferase (Fig 2C, Fig 2D). Furthermore, the wide

25

range of CC stabilities obtained for all the pairs enables the use of different CC-dimerizing elements to fine tune

26

the enzymatic activity.

. Consequently, pairing N-peptide variants with P variants (Table S1 sequences) can create an extended range

Regulation of split luciferase activity in cells by a displacer peptide

11

The stability of CCs and their formation in mammalian cells can be tuned by combining CC-forming peptide pairs

12

with different helical propensities. Thus, we examined whether the electrostatically cognate CC-forming peptide

13

(CC–displacer peptide), with a higher helical propensity, could displace the weaker interacting peptide within CC

14

in mammalian cells (scheme Fig 3A). CC–split luciferase was used as a reporter, and non-labeled peptides were

15

used as competitors. Initially, we tested whether co-expressed CC–displacer peptide, N7, could compete with CC

16

peptides tethered to the split luciferase (Fig 3B). Co-expression of the N7 CC–displacer peptide attenuated

17

reconstitution of the split luciferase tethered to peptides N8:P7SN, N8:P7, or N8:P7A (displacer peptide N5

18

attenuated N6:P5 split luciferase activity; Fig S5A) but, as expected, failed to effectively compete with the

19

immensely stable, N8:N7 CC (Fig 3C).

20
21

Since the externally added peptide provides a more direct and potentially therapeutically relevant way to

22

manipulate the activity of split proteins than co-expression of the CC–displacer peptide, we tested the efficacy of

23

strand displacement by adding synthetic CC–displacer peptide to cells expressing reconstituted CC–split luciferase

24

(Fig 3D). Three CC–displacer peptides with a cognate electrostatic motif (N7, P7A, and P7) were tested on four

25

combinations of CC–split luciferase: N8:N7, N8:P7A, N8:P7, and N8:P7SN (Fig 3E, Fig S5B). As predicted, N7

displacer peptide, with its high-helical propensity, debilitated CC-split luciferase assembly most efficiently only 2

2

hrs after the addition of a synthetic displacer peptide (Fig 3E). The P7A, P7, and P7SN peptides, for which the

3

midpoint Tm of N-P-CCs was more than 10 ºC lower than N-CCs, failed to displace the cognate peptide from the

4

N8:N7 split luciferase as efficiently (Fig S5B). Additionally, the N5 peptide effectively displaced cLuc:P5 from

5

the N6:P5 split luciferase (Fig S5C).

6
7

Moreover, the CC-displacer peptide with mismatched electrostatic motif failed to displace the cognate CC peptide

8

pair and, therefore, failed to attenuate the luciferase activity (Fig 3G, Fig S5D). Taken together, the results indicate

9

that the formation and disruption of CC-mediated pairs can be regulated by competition with an electrostatically

10

cognate peptide that forms stronger interactions.

Transcriptional regulation by the strong CC dimers

In order to further test the utility of the designed coiled-coil set, we prepared CC-regulated transcriptional

10

regulators. The transcription activator-like effector A (TALE-A) DNA-binding domain was fused to the N

11

terminus of a cognate CC pair. VP16 activation domain

domain; KRAB) 36, on the other hand, were fused to the C terminus of a CC-forming peptides (scheme Fig 4A,

repressor was reconstituted by combining TALE-A:CC with CC:VP16 and/or CC:KRAB. The reconstitution of

17

the TALE-A DNA-binding domain and VP16 activation domain via CC heterodimeric interaction was determined

18

by the expression of a reporter gene firefly luciferase.

19
20

Initially, we tested a reconstitution of TALE-A:N8 or TALE-A:N6 with CC:VP16 (Fig 4B, Fig S6A). The highest

21

expression of reporter luciferase under TALE promoter was detected for the combination of TALE-A:N8 with

22

N7:VP16 and TALE-A:N6 with N5:VP16 (Fig 4B). As expected, VP16 tethered to a PA peptide variant with

23

lower helical propensity resulted in a weaker transcription of the reporter. The efficiency of the reconstituted

24

transcription factor was more dependent on the amount of the transcriptional activation-domain-(CC:VP16)-

25

encoding plasmid than on DNA binding domain (TALE-A:CC), which can saturate the binding sites (Fig 4B, Fig

26

S6A). Only the cognate CC peptide pairs (TALE-A:N6 with N5:VP16 and TALE-A:N8 with N7:VP16) triggered

27

transcription of the reporter (Fig S6B). The results show that CC peptides with different stabilities can mediate the

28

efficiency of transcriptional activation, with expression reflecting the stability of the CC pairs.

29
30

Orthogonal CC peptides provide a very effective means of constructing multifunctional proteins. In addition to

31

genetically fused TALE-A to a single CC-peptide, we also created a construct, where the DNA binding domain

32

was fused to two consecutive orthogonal CC-peptides (N6 and N8; scheme Fig 4C). In order to demonstrate the

33

usability of orthogonal peptides, the TALE-A:N6:N8 was co-expressed with the CC:VP16 activator and/or

34

CC:KRAB repressor domain. While the combination of TALE-A:CC with CC:VP16 acted as a transcriptional

35

activator, the addition of CC:KRAB suppressed transcription (Fig 4C). Addition of the KRAB repressor tethered

36

to CC N5, P5A, P5, or P5SN peptides (CC:KRAB), with different affinities to N6 of the reconstituted TALE-

37

A:N6:N8 with N7:VP16, effectively suppressed transcription, correspondingly with their CC stability (Fig 4D). A

38

relatively low amount of co-transfected CC:KRAB plasmid was required for the effective suppression of the

transcription activator. Even when VP16 was replaced with the VPR activation domain, which is regarded as a

2

stronger domain 39, the co-expressed CC:KRAB domain nevertheless suppressed the transcription (scheme Fig

3

S6D, Fig S6E). The stability of CC formed between the CC:KRAB peptide and TALE-A:N6 determined the

4

degree of transcription suppression, with P5SN:KRAB being the weakest suppressor. Therefore, the same DNA

5

binding protein could be active, whether up- or down-regulated, which also represents a Boolean logic function

8

The activity of the multifunctional transcription factor, TALE-A:CC, could be regulated by CC:VP16 and

9

CC:KRAB association as well as by the addition of a CC-displacer peptide. The same strategy of the CC-displacer

10

peptide used for CC-split luciferase (Fig 3) could be used to regulate the repressor activity of TALE:N6:N8 with

11

N7:VP16 (scheme Fig 4E) and P5:KRAB (scheme Fig 4G). The reconstitution of the CC–split transcription factor,

12

similar to that of CC-split luciferase, was attenuated by co-expressed CC–displacer peptide tagged with a nuclear

13

localization signal (NLS). The degree of attenuation reflected the stability of CC within the CC-transcription factor

14

and CC-displacer peptide (Fig 4F, Fig S6C). As predicted, the N7 displacer peptide weakened the transcription

15

activator assembly most efficiently. P7A and P7, with a weaker affinity toward N8, failed to prevent the

16

reconstitution of a functional transcription as efficiently (Fig S6D). Besides, through the addition of increasing

17

amounts of N5NLS peptide (cognate to N6), we were able to displace the KRAB suppressor domain and regain

18

transcriptional activity (Fig 4G, 4H). Altogether, we demonstrated that the array of orthogonal CC peptide pairs

19

that form CCs with various ranges of stability represents an effective tool for rapid and effective regulation of

20

biological activity, likely transferrable to other enzymes, assemblies, and processes.

CC-mediated reporters for viral fusion protein-mediated syncytium formation

2

We realized that the high affinity between CC domains could be used to monitor the fusion of cells for the

3

syncytium formation. SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is mediated by a viral spike (S) protein, which binds to

4

the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a viral entry receptor

5

binding of the S1 domain of spike protein to the ACE2 receptor, which facilitates viral attachment to the surface

6

of target cells. Virus entry also requires the processing of the spike protein by the host transmembrane serine

7

protease 2 (TMPRSS2), which exposes the S fusion peptide. This process enables the fusion of the viral and

8

cellular membranes, a process driven by the spike protein’s S2 subunit 24,41. Monitoring membrane fusion triggered

9

by the binding of a viral fusion protein to the receptor represents an important assay for monitoring this key process

10

in viral infections. Many inhibitors, as well as vaccines, target viral attachment to host cells and the fusion process.

11

Experiments using active viruses or pseudoviruses are labor-intensive, slow, and require specific safety measures.

12

Fluorescent proteins and transcriptional activation in target cells have been used to monitor fusion triggered by the

13

S protein of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 receptor 40. An assay was prepared based on the fusion of cells expressing

14

ACE2 receptor protein (acceptor cells) and cells expressing the S protein (donor cells) at their surfaces. Formation

15

of cell fusion was detected by co-transfection of two cell groups with split luciferase reporters (cLuc:P7A and

16

nLuc:P8A or cLuc:N7 and nLuc:N8) with ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 S protein, respectively (Fig 5A). Mixing of

17

donor and acceptor cells resulted in a rapid reconstitution of the reporter in fused cells. The addition of CCs to a

18

split luciferase reporter acts as a strong dimerization domain, generating a high signal following cell fusion, but

19

only for cell combinations that expressed S protein and hACE2 (Fig 5B).

. Viral entry depends on the

In addition to a CC-split luciferase reporter, we set out to design a CC-split green fluorescent protein (GFP)

cytometry. The fusion of CC peptides to the split GFP improves the efficiency of the reporter reconstitution and

24

enables the detection of syncytia. We designed GFP1-10 genetically fused to the N7 or P7 peptide (GFP1-10:N7,

25

GFP1-10:P7) and GFP11 fused to N8 or P8 peptide (N8:GFP11, P8:GFP11; Fig 5C). The donor cells expressed S

26

protein, iRFP or mCherry, and CC-split GFP (GFP1-10:N7 or GFP1-10:P7). The acceptor cells expressed ACE2

27

receptor, BFP, and CC-split protein. Using CC-split GFP, we were able to detect cell-cell fusion both utilizing a

28

confocal microscope and via flow cytometry (Fig 5D, 5E). All syncytia also expressed iRFP and BFP. In order to

29

increase the sensitivity of flow cytometry for syncytium detection, a construct with linked three repeats of

30

N8:GFP11 (3×(N8:GFP11)) was designed (Fig 5D), which enables three molecules of GFP to reconstitute in a

31

fluorescent reporter. Indeed, this kind of reporter proved to be even more effective compared to the construct

32

containing only a single CC-forming peptide (Fig 5E).

The S protein-/ACE-mediated fusion process could, thus, be monitored at different stages, and inhibitor

the presence of TMPRSS2 protease (Fig S7A); however, a strong signal increase was observed upon the co-

Discussion/Conclusion

18

In this study, we designed and explored the potential of CC–peptide pairs with high stability as a tool for biological

19

applications. We expanded the validated orthogonal set of CC dimer-forming peptides 9 with two de novo designed

20

orthogonal CC–peptide pairs that exhibit low nanomolar Kd values and a Tm around 70 ºC. This improved stability

21

was achieved by increasing the helical propensity at noncontact positions and by addition of a single Asn residue

22

at a position. Since the modifications did not alter the dimerization interface, pairing specificity remained

23

unaffected 9. A single Asn residue (per peptide) that supports the desired orientation was positioned at the first or

24

fourth heptad. Although a previous study by Fletcher et al.

25

end of the heptad had a minor impact on stability, we determined that the peptide pairs, P7A:P8A and P5A:P6A,

26

with two Asn residues per peptide, had lower stability but still in the nanomolar range, and the Tm values were

27

reduced by at least 10 ºC. Contrastingly, the introduction of an additional Asn residue at the a position of N-type

28

CC peptides prevented homodimerization in the P7A:P8A pair and reduced the helical content of individual

29

peptides.

28

showed that a single Asn residue positioned at the

The application of newly designed CCs in a cellular environment confirmed their high affinity in the cellular milieu

3

and enabled regulation of activity of enzymes and transcriptional activation through genetic fusion with the CC-

4

forming peptides. The described peptide set enabled fine-tuning of the affinity by varying the helical propensity

5

of cognate peptide pairs while maintaining the electrostatic pattern. In comparison to the previously used set in

6

mammalian cells2, new pairs are more stable and were used to demonstrate new modalities of regulation through

7

the displacement of the weaker peptide from the existing CC pair, enabling up- or down-regulation with a wide,

8

dynamic range with the same promoter. Genetic fusion of two orthogonal CCs to the DNA binding domain enabled

9

transcription repressor and activator design within a single molecule. Transcriptional activity of the TALE-A:CC

10

DNA-binding domain and CC:VP16 was suppressed by the addition of a CC:KRAB domain. Also, externally

11

added peptides could regulate activity within cells.

12
13

Finally, high-affinity CC pairs were used to set up the assay for monitoring cell fusion. Genetic fusion to protein

14

interaction domains can guide protein complex formation 46, and strong affinities are needed for a robust output in

15

comparison to relying solely on the reconstitution of split GFP 43. We established an assay to monitor the SARS-

16

CoV-2 spike-protein-mediated cell-cell fusion, which allowed for quantitation by reconstitution of a CC-split

17

luciferase reporter or visualization of syncytia by the reconstituted CC-split GFP. The split luciferase reporter

18

genetically fused to CCs produced a robust response upon syncytia formation, guided by the interaction between

19

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and ACE2 receptor. Addition of the TMPRSS2 inhibitor, Camostat, or RBD, which

20

targets different steps in the fusion process, inhibited syncytia formation, validating the proteinase in S protein

21

processing and binding to ACE2 receptor as targets for viral entry. The strategy of self-reconstituted split GFP

22

previously described by Kamiyama et al.

23

could detect formed syncytia upon mixing donor and acceptor cells, enabling better visualization and flow

24

cytometric analysis. This rapid (~ 3hrs), sensitive assay enables screening of the inhibitors of this process as

25

potential drugs to prevent viral infection. In conclusion, high-affinity CC dimers represent valuable tools for

26

inquiring and regulating many biological processes.

Methods
Peptides, plasmids, and cell lines.
The peptides used in this study (Proteogenix, France) were protected at the N- and C-termini by acetylation and
amidation, respectively. All peptides were dissolved in a stock concentration of approximately 1 mg/ml in
deionized water, except for the water-insoluble N1 peptide, which was dissolved in 10 % (w/v) ammonium
bicarbonate. The exact peptide concentrations were determined based on absorbance at 280 nm, and the extinction
coefficients were calculated by the ProtParam web tool (https://web.expasy.org/cgi-bin/protparam/protparam). All
plasmids (listed in Table S4) were constructed using the Gibson assembly method. A human embryonic kidney
cell line, HEK293T (ATCC CRL-3216), was cultured in complete media (DMEM; 1 g/l glucose, 2 mM Lglutamine, 10 % heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco)) with 5 % CO2 at 37 ºC. We used plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to
express CCs and its fusions with split enzymes. Renilla luciferase (phRL-TK, Promega) was used as a transfection
control in all experiments in mammalian cells.
Immunoblotting.
HEK293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates (Techno Plastic Products) at 2.5 × 104 cells per well (1 ml). The next
day, the cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing CCs or CC-split luciferases. The total amount
of DNA for each transfection was 2.5 µg. Then, 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed with 1 ml PBS and
lysed in 100 µL of lysis buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mM EDTA, 2 % Triton X-100, 274 mM NaCl with a
cocktail of protease inhibitors (Roche)). Cells were incubated on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged for 15 min at
17,400 rpm at 4 ºC to remove cell debris. The total protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using
a BCA assay. Proteins from the supernatant were separated on 15 % SDS–PAGE gels (120 V, 60 min) and
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (350 mA, 30 min). Membrane blocking, antibody binding, and membrane
washing were performed with an iBind Flex Western device (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The primary antibodies were mouse anti-Myc (Cell signaling technologies; diluted 1:2,000), rabbit antiHA (Sigma H6908; diluted 1:2,000), and mouse anti-β-actin (Cell Signaling 3700; diluted 1:2,000). The secondary
antibodies were HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Abcam ab6721; diluted 1:3,000) and HRP-conjugated goat
anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz, sc2005; diluted 1:3,000). The secondary antibodies were detected with Pico or Femto
Western blotting detection reagent (Super Signal West Femto; Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
CD spectroscopy.
CD measurements were performed with a ChiraScan instrument (Applied Photophysics, UK) equipped with a
Peltier thermal control block (Melcor, NJ, Laird Technologies). The final concentrations of individual peptides
were 40 μM in Tris buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM TCEP). The mixture also contained
a 20 μM concentration of each peptide. All experiments were performed in a quartz cuvette (Hellma, Germany)
with a path length of 1 mm. CD spectra were measured every 1 nm from 200–280 nm with a bandwidth of 1 nm
and 0.5 s integration time. The results are the average of three scans. Temperature denaturation scans were
performed by measuring the CD signal at 222 nm from 0 to 95 ºC in 1 ºC increments at a rate of 1 ºC/min. The
actual sample temperatures were measured directly in the cuvette using a temperature probe. The CD spectrum
was measured at 95 ºC and at 20 ºC after rapid cooling. For all peptides, the spectra after refolding matched the
ones taken before the temperature scan.
SEC-MALS.
A Waters e2695 HPLC system coupled with a 2489 UV detector (Waters, MA) and a Dawn 8+ multiple-angle
light scattering detector (Wyatt, CA) was used for SEC-MALS experiments. Peptides (200 μM in 50 mM TrisHCl with a pH of 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 10 % glycerol) were filtered using Durapore 0.1 μm centrifuge filters
(Merck Millipore, Ireland) before being injected onto the Biosep SEC-S2000 column (Phenomenex, CA), with the
exception of the peptide N2, which was injected in a Superdex 30 increase column (GE, IL). The mobile phases
used for the separations were 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM
NaCl for the Biosep SEC-S2000 column and the Superdex 30 increase column, respectively. The injection volume
was 50 μl, and the flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. Data analysis was carried out with Astra 7.0 software (Wyatt, CA)
utilizing the theoretical extinction coefficient calculated by ProtParam.

ITC.
MicroCal VP-ITC (Microcal, Northampton, MA) was used to measure the equilibrium dissociation constant (K D)
of orthogonal CC pairs. A 280-µL syringe was filled with the peptide solution (10 µM in 50 mM Tris-HCl with a
pH of 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM TCEP). The samples were injected into an ITC cell (volume 1.3862 ml) filled
with a complimentary peptide (1 µM) in a matching buffer through a 27-step process. The injection volumes were
10 µl and were spaced 600 s apart, with the exception of the first priming injection of 2 µl with 3200 s spacing.
Before each ITC experiment, the sample and buffer solutions were degassed in an ultrasonic water bath. The
integration of heat pulses and model-fitting were performed with Origin 7.0 using a single-site binding model.
Modeling CC interactions and structures.
To evaluate the orthogonality of the designed CC sets, the interactions between all possible peptide pairs were
predicted by the scoring function introduced by Potapov et al. 31. For each peptide pair, the interaction score was
calculated for three different relative alignments of the peptide chain. The amino acid sequences were either
completely aligned or staggered by one heptad in the reverse or forward direction. The lowest score was taken as
the interaction score of the peptide pair.
The Potapov scoring function ignores the contribution of amino acids at the b, c, and f positions and, therefore,
cannot be used to predict the impact of mutations in these positions on CC stability. The scoring function
introduced by Drobnak et al. 16 was used to evaluate the effect of b, c, and f mutations on CC stability. The melting
temperatures for all peptide pairs were calculated using the following equation:
𝑇𝑚 = 0.349𝑇𝑚𝑏𝐶𝐼𝑃𝐴 − 1.1𝐶𝑃 + 0.305𝐻𝑒𝑙 + 20.5,
𝐵𝐶𝐼𝑃𝐴
where 𝑇𝑚
is the melting temperature predicted by bCIPA 47; CP is the peptide pair charge product; and Hel
is the number of residues in a peptide pair with helicity above 0.05, as predicted by Agadir 32.
The model structures of designed CCs were built using the ISAMBARD modeling package 48. Structural
parameters (superhelix radius, pitch, and Crick angle) were optimized using a genetic algorithm. The following
space of parameters was searched: superhelix radius 5 ± 1 Å, pitch 200 ± 60 Å, Crick angle at a position 26 ± 27º.
The relative shift along the superhelical axis was assumed to be zero. The internal energy was evaluated using the
BUDE force field 49.
Split luciferase and split transcription factor reconstitution.
HEK293T cells were seeded in 96-well plates (Corning) at 2.5 × 104 cells per well (0.1 ml). The next day, cells
were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing CCs fused to split luciferase or plasmids expressing CCsplit transcription factor (sequences are shown in Table S4), and phRL-TK (Promega) constitutively expressing
Renilla luciferase (5 ng per well, for normalization of transfection efficiency) using the PEI transfection reagent.
The total amount of DNA for each transfection was kept constant by adding appropriate amounts of the control
plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen).
For displacement of CCs by peptides, the HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing N- and Cterminal segments of split luciferase (nLuc and cLuc) fused to CC-forming peptides or CC-split transcription
factors, plasmids expressing CC-displacer peptides under cytomegalovirus (CMV), and phRL-TK (Promega)
constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase (5 ng per well) using the PEI transfection reagent Synthetic peptides
were transfected into cells using DOTAP transfection reagent according to manufacturer instructions. Briefly, 48h
after plasmid transfection, peptides were diluted in Hepes buffer to the working concentration of 100µM and then
further diluted to final concentrations used on cells. DOTAP transfection reagent was added to peptide solution
and, after 15-minute incubation, transferred to cell media. Two hours later, the media was removed, cells were
washed with PBS to remove any additional peptides in media and lysed using 1x Passive lysis buffer.
Viral fusion protein-mediated syncytium formation –Luciferase assay.

Syncytia is formed by the fusion of cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein on the cell surface with
neighboring cells expressing ACE2 receptor leading to the formation of multi-nucleate enlarged cells.
For fusion assay, the spike expressing (donor) cells and ACE2 receptor-expressing (acceptor) cells were
mixed in 1:1 ratio. HEK293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates (Corning) at 5 × 104 cells per well (2 ml). The
next day, cells were transiently transfected with plasmids. The acceptor group was transfected with plasmids
encoding cLuc:CC, ACE-2 receptor, and TMPRSS-2. The donor group was transfected with nLuc:CC and SARS-

CoV-2 S protein using the PEI transfection reagent. The total amount of DNA for each transfection was kept
constant by adding appropriate amounts of the control plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). 24h after transfection, cells
were detached from 6 well plates using a solution of PBS, EDTA (2,5mM). Wells were additionally washed with
DMEM, 10% FBS. Cells were then centrifugated (5min, 1500rpm), resuspended in 1ml DMEM, 10%FBS, and
counted using the automated cell counter, Countess. Both groups of resuspended cells were diluted to a final
concentration of 1×105 cells/ml, mixed in ratio 1:1, and seeded to 96-well plates. TMPRSS2 inhibitor Camostat
mesylate (1-5µM) or RBD (10-100µg/ml) were added to diluted cells expressing ACE2 receptor before mixing
them with cells expressing S protein.
Three hours after mixing both cell groups, luciferase activity was measured as previously described 3, 10 µl of
0.5mM luciferase substrate luciferin and 2.5mM ATP was added per well before luciferase activity was measured
with Orion II microplate reader, Berthold Technologies.
Viral fusion protein-mediated syncytium formation- Flow cytometry.
For flow cytometer analysis, the cells were seeded in a 12-well plate (Costar) (1 ml, 2.5 × 105 cells/ml). At 70%
confluency, the donor HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing S protein, fluorescent protein,
iRFPNLS, and syncytia reporter split fluorescent protein, GFP1-10 (GFP1-10:N7, GFP1-10:P7 or GFP1-10). Acceptor
cells were transfected with plasmids expressing a fluorescent protein, BFPNLS, ACE2 receptor, and syncytia
reporter split protein, GFP11 (N8:GFP11, 3×(N8:GFP11), P8:GFP11 )using PEI transfection reagent. Plasmid
pcDNA3 was used to adjust the amount of plasmid DNA. Eighteen hours post-transfection, the spike expressing
cells were detached from the surface using PBS, EDTA (2.5mM). Wells were additionally washed with DMEM,
10% FBS. Donor cells were then added to the ACE2 acceptor cells in 1:1 ratio. Syncytia were analyzed 3 h later.
For inhibition of syncytium formation, soluble RBD (50-100µg/ml) or Camostat (50-100µM) was added to the
cells at the same time as a mixture of cells was formed.
Syncytia formation was analyzed using the spectral flow cytometer Aurora with the blue, violet, and red lasers
(Cytek). The cells gated positive for iRFP and BFP were examined for fluorescence intensity of reconstituted split
GFP. The fluorescence intensity is presented as the median value. Data were analyzed using FlowJo (TreeStar,
Ashland, OR, USA) and SpectroFlo (Cytek) software.
Viral fusion protein-mediated syncytium formation-confocal microscopy.
For confocal microscopy, acceptor cells were seeded in an 8-well tissue culture chamber (µ-Slide 8 well, Ibidi
Integrated BioDiagnostics, Martinsried München, Germany) (0.2 ml, 2.5 × 105 cells/ml), and acceptor cells were
seeded in 24- well plates. At 70% confluency, the donor HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing
S protein, syncytia reporter split fluorescent protein GFP1-10 (GFP1-10:N7, GFP1-10:P7 or GFP1-10) and fluorescent
protein mCherryNLS, and the acceptor cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the ACE2 receptor, syncytia
reporter split protein GFP11 (N8:GFP11, 3×(N8:GFP11), P8:GFP11 ), and fluorescent protein BFP using PEI
transfection reagent. Plasmid pcDNA3 was used to adjust the amount of plasmid DNA. Eighteen hours posttransfection, the spike expressing cells were detached from the surface using EDTA (2,5mM) and added to the
ACE2 acceptor cells in 1:1 ratio. Syncytia were analyzed 3 h later.
Microscopic images were acquired using the Leica TCS SP5 inverted laser-scanning microscope on a Leica DMI
6000 CS module equipped with an HCX Plane-Apochromat lambda blue 63 × oil-immersion objectives with NA
1.4 (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). A 488-nm laser line of a 100-mW argon laser with 10% laser power
was used for split GFP excitation, and the emitted light was detected between 500 and 540 nm. A 1-mW 543-nm
HeNe laser was used for mCherry:N6:NLS transfection control excitation and emitted light was detected between
580 and 620 nm. A 50-mW 405-nm diode laser was used for BFP transfection control, and emitted light was
detected between 420 and 460 nm. The images were processed with LAS AF software (Leica Microsystems) and
ImageJ software (National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).
Dual-luciferase assays.
At indicated time points, the cells were lysed in Passive Lysis 1× Buffer (Promega) and analyzed with a dualluciferase reporter assay to determine the firefly luciferase and the Renilla luciferase activities (Orion II microplate
reader, Berthold Technologies). Relative luciferase units (RLU) were calculated by normalizing the firefly
luciferase value to the constitutive Renilla luciferase value in each sample. Normalized RLU values (nRLU) were
