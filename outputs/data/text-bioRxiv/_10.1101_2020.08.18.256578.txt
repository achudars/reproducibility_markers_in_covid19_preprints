ABSTRACT

32

There is an urgent need for a safe and protective vaccine to control the global spread of

33

SARS-CoV-2 and prevent COVID-19. Here, we report the immunogenicity and

34

protective efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) produced from

35

the full-length SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein stabilized in the prefusion

36

conformation. Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) immunized with NVX-

37

CoV2373 and the saponin-based Matrix-M adjuvant induced anti-S antibody that was

38

neutralizing and blocked binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2

39

(hACE2) receptor. Following intranasal and intratracheal challenge with SARS-CoV-2,

40

immunized macaques were protected against upper and lower infection and pulmonary

41

disease. These results support ongoing phase 1/2 clinical studies of the safety and

42

immunogenicity of NVX-CoV2327 vaccine (NCT04368988).

1. INTRODUCTION

46

There is an urgent need for a safe and effective severe acute respiratory syndrome

47

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).

48

We have developed a recombinant nanoparticle vaccine constructed from the

49

full-length, wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (GenBank gene sequence

50

MN908947, nucleotides 21563-25384) optimized for the baculovirus-Spodoptera

51

frugiperda (Sf9) insect cell expression system [1]. In mice and nonhuman primates

52

(NHP), NVX-CoV2373 with a Matrix-M1 saponin-based adjuvant induced high titer anti-

53

spike IgG that blocks binding to the hACE2 receptor, neutralize wild type virus, and

54

protects mice against SARS-CoV-2 challenge with no evidence of vaccine-associated

55

enhanced respiratory disease. NVX-CoV2373 vaccine also induces polyfunctional CD4+

56

T-cell responses of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α biased towards a Th1 phenotype, and

57

generates antigen-specific germinal center B cells in the spleen. Safety and

58

immunogenicity NVX-CoV2327 vaccine is currently under evaluation in humans

59

(NCT04368988) and primary safety and immunogenicity outcomes described [2]. We

60

evaluate in the current study NVX-CoV2373 vaccine immunogenicity, induction of

61

receptor blocking, and neutralizing antibodies compared to levels in human COVID-19

62

convalescent sera. And in a nonhuman primate challenge model, protection against

63

upper and lower virus replication and pulmonary disease.

2.4. Cynomolgus macaque immunization

91

Cynomolgus macaques >3 years old (n=4/group) at study initiation received 5 or

92

25 μg NVX-CoV2327 with 50 μg Matrix-M1 (Novavax AB, Uppsala, Sweden)

93

administered in 500 μL in the thigh muscle in two doses spaced 21 days apart. A

94

separate group was immunized with a factional dose (2.5 μg) NVX-CoV2373 with 25 μg

95

Matrix-M1 in two doses spaced 21 days apart and a placebo group received formulation

96

buffer. Serum was collected before immunization on Day 0, Day 21 just prior to the

97

second immunization, and Day 33.

98

Anti-spike (S) IgG ELISA

99

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein IgG ELISA titers were measured as described

100

[1]. Anti-S IgG EC50 titers were calculated by 4-parameter fitting using SoftMax Pro

101

6.5.1 GxP software. Individual animal anti-S IgG EC50 titers, group geometric mean

102

titers (GMT) were plotted using GraphPad Prism 7.05 software.

103

2.5. Inhibition of hACE2 receptor binding and neutralization

104

Antibodies that block binding of hACE2 receptor to the S-protein and neutralize in a

105

cytopathic effect assay (CPE) in Vero E6 cells were measured as described previously

106

as the serum titer that blocks 100% CPE [1]. Serum antibody titer at 50% binding

107

inhibition (IC50) of hACE2 to SARS-CoV-2 S protein was determined in the SoftMax Pro

108

program. Individual animal hACE2 receptor inhibiting titers, mean titers, and SEM were

109

plotted using GraphPad Prism 7.05 software. Neutralizing antibody titers were

determined as the dilution of serum that inhibited 100% of CPE (CPE100) at 3 days post

111

infection of Vero E6 cells in a 96 well plate format.

112

2.6. SARS-CoV-2 challenge procedure

113

The virus challenge study was done at BIOQUAL, Inc. within a BSL-3 containment

114

facility. SARS-CoV-2 generated from isolate 2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020 was received

115

from BEI Resources (NR-52281; lot # 70033175) and expanded in Vero E6 cells for

116

challenge stock generation. Animals were sedated and challenged with a targeted total

117

dose of 1.04 x 104 pfu SARS-CoV-2 by intranasal (IN) and intratracheal (IT) in a volume

118

of 0.25 mL each route. BAL and nasal swabs were collected 2- and 4-days post

119

challenge. Necropsy was performed 7 days following challenge and lung tissues

120

collected for histopathology.

121

2.7. RNA subgenomic RT-PCR

122

The subgenomic viral mRNA (sgRNA) was measured in macaque bronchoalveolar

123

lavage (BAL) and nasal swabs collected 2- and 4-days post challenge using RT-PCR as

124

described [4]. To generate a standard curve, the SARS-CoV-2 E gene sgRNA was

125

cloned into a pcDNA3.1 expression plasmid. The insert was transcribed using an

126

AmpliCap-Max T7 High Yield Message Maker Kit (Cellscript, Madison, WI) to obtain

127

RNA for standards. Prior to RT-PCR, samples collected from challenged animals or

128

standards were reverse-transcribed using Superscript III VILO (Invitrogen) according to

129

the manufacturer’s instructions. A Taqman custom gene expression assay

130

(ThermoFisher Scientific, Rockville, MD) was designed using the sequences targeting

131

the E gene sgRNA. Reactions were carried out on a Quant Studio 6 and 7 Flex Real-

Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the

133

manufacturer’s specifications. Standard curves were used to calculate sgRNA in copies

134

per mL. The quantitative assay was sensitive to 50 copies per mL.

135

2.8. Human COVID-19 convalescent serum

136

Convalescent serum samples (n=32) were provided by Dr. Pedro A Piedra (Baylor

137

College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA). Samples were collected from COVID-19

138

individuals 18-79 years of age 4-6 weeks after testing positive for SARS CoV-2.

139

Symptoms ranged from asymptomatic, mild to moderate symptoms, to severe

140

symptoms requiring hospitalization. Sera were analyzed for anti-SARS-CoV-2 S IgG,

141

hACE2 receptor inhibition, and virus neutralizing antibody titers.

142

2.9. Histopathology

143

Animals were euthanized 7-days following SARS-CoV-2 challenge (Day 42) and

144

lung tissues collected. Tissue were prepared for histologic examination by Experimental

145

Pathology Laboratories, Inc. (EPL, Sterling, VA). The lungs were fixed with 10%

146

formalin, paraffin embedded, and sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for

147

histological examination. Slides were examined for total inflammation, periarteriolar, and

148

peribronchiolar inflammation and epithelial cell denuding.

induced anti-S IgG (EC50) antibodies at Day 21 after a single dose (GMT = 7,810,

155

22,386 and 21,472, respectively). Two weeks following a booster immunization, anti-S

156

IgG EC50 titers increased to GMT EC50 = 163,036, 335,017 and 469,739, respectively

157

(Figure 1A). In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 anti-S antibody in convalescent human sera was

158

6.9- to 14.2-fold less with at GMT EC50 of 23,614 (Figure 1B). And, hACE2 receptor

159

inhibition titers of 649, 1,410, and 1,320 in 2.5, 5, and 25 µg NVX-CoV2373 dose groups

160

respectively were 5.2 – 11.2-fold higher than in convalescent sera (Figure 1C). Finally,

161

SARS-CoV-2 GMT neutralization antibody titers of 17,920 - 23,040 CPE100 in

162

immunized macaques, were 7.9 – 10.1-fold higher than in convalescent sera (Figure

163

164

3.2. Viral load in nasal swabs and BAL

165

To evaluate the potential efficacy of NVX-CoV2373 vaccine, macaques were

166

challenged with SARS-CoV-2 virus in upper and lower airways. Macaques in the

167

placebo group had 9,131 sgRNA copies/mL in the BAL at 2 days post challenge and

168

remained elevated at day 4 except for one animal. In contrast, immunized animals had

169

no detectable sgRNA in BAL fluid other than one animal in the low dose group at day 2

170

which cleared replicating virus RNA by day 4 (Figure 1E). Half of the controls had ~4

171

log10 of virus sgRNA copies in nasal swabs and in contrast, no detectable sgRNA was

172

in the nose of NVX-CoV2373 vaccinated animals (Figure 1F).

previous reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques [5-10] placebo control

177

animals had moderate to severe inflammation that involved the mucosa of the bronchi,

178

perivascular mononuclear infiltrate with mixed infiltrates of macrophages and

179

neutrophils within the alveoli. In contrast, there was little, or no inflammation observed in

180

the lungs of macaques immunized with NVX-CoV2373 vaccine 7 days post challenge

181

(Figure 2). These findings were consistent the absence of sgRNA in BAL fluids and

182

183

Discussion

184

Here, we report the immunogenicity and the protective efficacy of a prefusion,

185

stabilized, full-length SARS-CoV-2 S vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) in the cynomolgus

186

macaque model permissive to infection [11]. Prime and booster immunization with NVX-

187

CoV2373 vaccine with Matrix1-M adjuvant induced high levels of anti-S IgG and

188

antibodies that blocked SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to the hACE2 receptor and

189

neutralized the virus. Importantly, vaccinated nonhuman primates had little or no

190

detectable replicating virus (sgRNA) in either upper or lower respiratory tracks. These

191

results demonstrate a potential of NVX-CoV2373 vaccine to protect the lower

192

respiratory track against pulmonary disease and upper respiratory track against virus

193

replication thus helping to establish herd immunity and to halt the COVID-19 pandemic

194

and its devastating global impact.

Figure 2. Representative histopathology of lungs from NVX-CoV2373 vaccinated
cynomolgus macaques challenged with SARS-CoV-2 (WA1 strain). Histological
findings of representative placebo treated animals included eosinophils expanding the
mucosa of the bronchi, perivascular mononuclear infiltrate, with mixed macrophages
and neutrophils within the alveoli at 7 days post infection. In the 5 μg dose group, one
animal had mild to moderate perivascular infiltrate while other animals had no
remarkable findings. There were no remarkable histological changes in the bronchial,
vascular or alveoli in animals vaccinated with 50 μg NVX-CoV2373. There was no
evidence of exacerbated lung inflammation in NVX-CoV2373 immunized animals.
