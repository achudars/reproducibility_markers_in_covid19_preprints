Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 enters into human airway epithelial cells via membrane fusion or endocytosis,
and this process is dependent on ACE2, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L. In this study, we
examined the expression profiles of the three SARS-CoV-2 entry-related genes in primary
human airway epithelial cells isolated from donors with different physiological and
pathological backgrounds such as smoking, COPD, asthma, lung cancer, allergic rhinitis,
cystic fibrosis, or viral infections. By reanalyzing 54 GEO datasets comprising transcriptomic
data of 3428 samples, this study revealed that i) smoking is associated with an increased
expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and a decreased expression of cathepsin L; ii) infection of
rhinovirus as well as poly(I:C) stimulation leads to high expression of all three SARS-CoV-2
entry-related genes; iii) expression of ACE2 and cathepsin L in nasal epithelial cells are
decreased in patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis. In conclusion, this study implicates
that infection of respiratory viruses, cigarette smoking and allergic respiratory diseases might
affect the susceptibility to and the development of COVID-19.

Introduction
In December 2019, a cluster of viral pneumonia cases which is featured by pulmonary
parenchymal opacities at chest radiography was reported in Wuhan, China 1. Analysis of
lower respiratory tract samples from patients identified a novel beta-coronavirus termed
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as the casual pathogen for
the pneumonia 2. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic 3. As of June 29, 2020, there have been
over ten million laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID19 worldwide with more than a half
million deaths 4. SARS-CoV-2 shares approximately 80% sequence identify to SARS-CoV
and both viruses use the same cell entry receptor, namely angiotensin converting enzyme 2
(ACE2)

5, 6

. As the receptor of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 mediates the viral entry

via two major pathways, cathpesine L-dependent endocytosis and transmembrane serine
protease 2 (TMPRSS2) dependent membrane fusion

7-9

. Since COVID-19 is an acute disease

resulted from respiratory tract infection of SARS-CoV-2, the interaction between the spike
protein (S protein) of the virus and the ACE2 on human airway epithelial cells is a crucial step
for the development of the disease.

Although SARS-CoV-2 can infect individuals of any age, most of the severe cases have been
reported in older adults or patients with significant comorbidities including chronic
respiratory diseases

10

. For example, it has been demonstrated that Chronic Obstructive

Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is associated with a significant, roughly five-fold increased risk
for the development of severe COVID-19 infections

11, 12

. Understanding the molecular

mechanisms behind the increased risk for severe COVID-19 in patients with chronic
respiratory diseases would provide clues toward their pathophysiology and the identification
of therapeutic targets. Since ACE2 might play an important role in protecting the host against
lung injury

13

, one hypothesis is that the expression of ACE2 in airway epithelial cells of

patients with chronic respiratory diseases might be upregulated, which enhances the infection
of SARS-CoV-2. This notion is partially supported by a recent study, in which Leung et al.
reported that smokers and patients with COPD show a higher levels ACE-2 than healthy nonsmokers 14.

Here, our objective is to draw a complete picture of the expression of three genes essentially
involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry, namely ACE2, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin L in human airway
epithelial cells under both physiological and pathological conditions. To reach this aim, we
retrieved previously published transcriptomic datasets of human airway epithelial cells of
healthy subjects with different status of cigarette smoking as well as patients with various
respiratory diseases, including COPD, asthma, allergic rhinitis, lung cancer, cystic fibrosis
and viral infection.

Results
Study selection and data retrieval

A search of the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with the key word “Airway
epithelial cells” resulted in 5065 hits. In the next step, 642 non-human items, 4099 non-series
items, and 153 items of non-gene expression array were filtered out. Subsequent assessment
further excluded 117 items which were transcriptomic data of cell lines, redundant data, or
datasets containing only one group or less than 5 samples per group. Finally, 54 GEO datasets
comprising 3428 transcriptomic data of human airway epithelial cells were identified (Fig. 1,
Supplementary Fig. 1). Microarray data of each dataset were retrieved from the GEO database.
After combining datasets generated by same research group with identical platforms, 28
transcriptomic datasets were generated and used for further analysis (Supplementary table 1).

After background correction and normalization of each transcriptomic dataset, expression
levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L were used for further analysis.

Cigarette smoking affects expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L in human airway
epithelial cells

To examine the expression of the three genes in airway epithelial cells under physiological
conditions, we performed comparisons among healthy individuals according to their status of
cigarette smoking. The first comparison was performed between current smokers and never
smokers. In total, 12 comparisons were performed, with 594 current smokers and 329 never
smokers

15-31

. As shown in Fig. 2a, mean values of expression levels of AEC2 in current

smoker were consistently higher than those in never smokers in all 12 comparisons, and
differences in 6 out of 12 were statistically significant. Meta-analysis for the standardised
mean difference (SMD) showed a moderate effect of smoking on ACE2 expression
(SMD=0.70, P<0.001) (Fig. 2b). Similar to ACE2 expression, the expression of TMPRSS2
was also significantly increased in airway epithelial cells of current smoker as compared to
never smokers (SMD=0.64, P=0.001) (Fig.2 a,b). By contrast, smoking affected the
expression of cathepsin L in the opposite direction. As compared to never smokers, current
smokers expressed significantly lower levels of cathepsin L (SMD=-0.43, P<0.001) (Fig.
2a,b).

We next investigated whether the effect of cigarette smoking on the three genes reflects a
chronic or an acute response of the tissue. Six datasets which contain expression data of
former smokers and current smokers were recruited for this comparison 16, 23, 29, 32-34. Notably,
the differences in the expression of the three genes between current smokers and former
smokers follow the same pattern observed between current smokers and never smokers. As
compared to former smokers, current smokers showed a moderate increased expression levels
of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which was found to be significant only for the latter protein

(ACE2;SMD=0.58, P=0.11 and TMPRSS2; SMD=0.27, P=0.003, respectively). By contrast,
decreased levels were seen for cathepsin L (SMD=-0.31, P=0.046) (Supplementary Fig. 2). In
line with this observation, a comparison between never smokers and former smokers

16, 23, 29

revealed no significant differences between these group with regard to the expression of this
genes (Supplementary Fig. 3). Thus, these results suggest that the effect of cigarette smoking
on expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L is more likely an acute reaction than a
chronic alteration of the tissue.
The acute effect of cigarette smoking on ACE2 was confirmed in a further dataset 35. In this
study, current smokers were asked to refrain from cigarette smoking for at least 2 days and
then subjected to acute smoking exposure. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, the acute
smoking exposure increased the expression of ACE2, but showed no effect on TMPRSS2 or
cathepsin L.

Expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L in COPD, lung cancer and cystic fibrosis

Consequently, we compared in the next step expression profiles of the three SARS-CoV-2
entry-related genes of epithelial cells derived from none-diseased subjects with those of
patients with different respiratory disorders. Since smoking has a major impact on the
expression of these genes, we focused on COPD as a smoking-related disease in a first
approach.

Three datasets were recruited to compare never smoker control and COPD patients

15, 17-21, 25,

26, 28, 31, 36

. Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were found to be increased, while the

expression of cathepsin L was decreased in COPD patients as compared to never smoker
controls (Fig. 3a-b). Meta-analysis revealed a strong effect of COPD on ACE2 expression

(SMD=0.82, P<0.0001), a moderate effect on TMPRSS2 (SMD=0.57, P<0.0001), and no
significant effect on cathepsin L.

Since most the COPD patients were smokers, we next determined whether the effect of COPD
on expression of our target genes is due to cigarette smoking by comparing COPD patients
with healthy smokers

15, 17-21, 25, 26, 28, 31, 34, 37

. As shown in Fig. 3c-d, expression levels of

ACE2 and cathepsin L are similar between both groups. The only difference between the two
groups could be assigned to the expression of TMPRSS2, where COPD patients showed
moderately higher RNA levels than healthy smokers (SMD=0.31, P<0.001). According to
these results, the observed difference in the expression of the three SARS-CoV-2 entry-related
genes between COPD patients and healthy controls is mainly due to cigarette smoking but not
to disease manifestation.

To substantiate these findings, we examined the relationship between the lung function of
COPD patients and gene expression by data from a further study in which lung function
parameters were included 34. , Expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L were
not correlated with the first second of forced expiration (FEV1) or FEV1/FVC (Forced vital
capacity) suggesting that the impairment of lung function does not affect the expression
SARS-CoV-2 entry related genes (Supplementary Fig. 5).

Cigarette smoking does not only promote COPD but represents also a main cause for lung
cancer. Therefore, we evaluated next the expression the three genes in patients with lung
cancer and in corresponding healthy controls. In total, 7 datasets were recruited for the
comparison, including 1003 patients and 540 healthy controls

29, 32, 38-42

. Of note, healthy

control subjects and patients in each dataset were identical in smoking status, either never
smokers, former smokers or current smokers. Meta-analysis showed that lung cancer is
associated with a very mild effect on modulation of expression of ACE2 (SMD=-0.16,
P=0.0038) and cathepsin L (SMD=-0.18, P=0.0011) (Supplementary Fig. 6).

To include a chronic respiratory disease which induction is independent of smoking we
analyzed one dataset derived from patients with cystic fibrosis 43. Since ACE2 expression was
not analyzed here, we could only compare the expression of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L
between patients and healthy controls. With five subjects in each group, no significant
difference in the expression of the two genes was observed between patients and controls
(Supplementary Fig. 7).

Expression of ACE2 and cathepsin L is decreased in nasal epithelial cells in asthma and
allergic rhinitis

In the next step we determined the expression profile of the three genes in two chronic
allergic respiratory diseases, allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis. The comparison between
patients with allergic rhinitis and healthy subjects involved 3 comparisons, including two with
bronchial epithelial cells and one with nasal epithelial cells

44, 45

. Meta-analysis revealed a

moderate decreasing effect of asthma on ACE2 (SMD=-0.76, P=0.0015) and cathepsin L
(SMD=-0.62, P=0.039) expression. Moreover, this effect was seen more prominent on nasal
epithelial cells than on bronchial epithelial cells (Supplementary Fig. 8a,b). A decreased
expression of cathepsin L was also observed in patients with asthma as compared to healthy
controls (SMD=-0.52, P=0.0049)

30, 44-46

. Comparable to samples derived from rhinitis

patients, the effect was drastically stronger on nasal epithelial cells than bronchial epithelial
cells (Supplementary Fig. 8c,d).

Since both asthma and rhinitis are allergic respiratory diseases, we combined the two diseases
to examine their effect on nasal epithelial cells. As expected, the meta-analysis revealed that
the two diseases are associated with a strong effect on decreasing expression of ACE2 (SMD=
-1.25, P<0.001) and cathepsin L (SMD=-0.77, P=0.0034) (Fig. 4).

Viral infection increases significantly the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L

Finally, we examined the effect of viral infection, including experimental infection with
rhinovirus in vivo and stimulation with rhinovirus in vitro 47-49, on the expression of the three
SARS-CoV-2 entry related genes in airway epithelial cells.

As shown in Fig. 5, in vivo experimental infection with rhinovirus increased expression levels
of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L 48 h after infection. In line with this result, in vitro
stimulation of primary human airway epithelial cells isolated from healthy subjects or asthma
patients with rhinovirus increased the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (Fig. 5).

The stimulatory effect of viral infection on the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry
associated genes was further confirmed in a dataset of human primary airway epithelial cells
stimulated by poly(I:C)

50

, a ligand of TLR3 which recognizes viral double-stranded RNA.

After the stimulation, both primary epithelial cells from healthy subjects and patients with
asthma expressed significantly higher levels of all three genes (Fig. 5).

Since it has been recently reported that ACE2 expression in airway epithelial cells is
positively regulated by interferons

51

, we speculated that this may reflect the mechanism

underlying the effect of viral infection. To this end, we further examined the expression of
IFNs in the datasets analyzed priviously. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 9, experimental
viral infection, in vitro viral stimulation, and the poly(I:C) stimulation all resulted in an
significantly increased expression of IFN-β supporting our notion.

In this study, we examined expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L in human
airway epithelial cells derived from donors with different various physiological and
pathological background. By comprehensive analysis, we generated a complete picture of
expression profiling of the three SARS-CoV-2 entry related genes.

In our current study we can demonstrate that current smokers show a highly significant
increase in ACE2 expression as compared to never smokers, which is in line with previous
findings 14. Moreover, our study extends the analysis to two other SARS-CoV-2 entry-related
genes, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. Unexpectedly, smoking exerts antagonistic effects on the
expression of TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L in airway epithelial cells by increasing the
expression of the former but decreasing the latter. In several recent meta-analysis it was
reported that smoking is associated with an approximately 2 fold increase in the risk of
developing severe COVID-19

12, 52, 53

, and it has been hypothesized that this increase may be

caused by an elevated expression of ACE2 in smoking subjects14. However, our data
implicate that the disease-promoting effect of smoking cannot be explained by a simple upregulation of genes identified to be relevant for the virus entry. First of all, the difference
between never-smokers and current smokers appears with a 20% elevation in ACE2 mRNA
expression in the latter group as rather low and is unclear, whether this minor disparity has
any pathophysiological consequence. Moreover, smoking increases the expression of
TMPRSS2 but decreases the expression of cathepsin L. Accordingly, it is conceivable that
smoking might enhance the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via membrane fusion but decrease the
entry via endocytosis. Since it remains unknown whether the viral entry via the two ways
make difference for SARS-CoV-2 infection 7, 54, the mechanisms of smoking on SARS-CoV2 infection remain to be elucidated.

Irrespective of the unclear pathomechanism of smoking on SARS-CoV-2 infection, our study
uncovered an unexpected difference in the expression of the three genes between current
smokers and former smokers, but not between former smokers and never smokers. This result

indicates an enormous acute effect of smoking on the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entryassociated genes. In contrast to many chronic and irreversible changes in the lung, smoking
cessation could be effective to reduce the potential risk emanating from the alternation of the
viral entry associated genes.

According to our findings, COPD, a chronic respiratory disease mainly caused by cigarette
smoking, is also associated with an increased expression of ACE2 in human airway epthelial
cells. However, the effect seems largely related to smoking rather than the disease itself since
i) the differences of the gene expression become visible only between COPD patients and
never-smoker healthy controls, but do not appear between COPD patients and healthy smoker
controls, ii) the variations in the expression of the three genes between COPD patients and
never smoker controls follow the same pattern as that between healthy smokers and never
smokers, and iii) lung function is not correlated with the expression of the three genes.

Similar to COPD, patients with lung cancer also do not show high levels of the three SARSCoV-2 related genes than healthy smoker controls. In addition, those genes are also not
upregulated airway epithelial cells of three other respiratory diseases, namely asthma, allergic
rhinitis and cystic fibrosis. Taken together, these results do not support the hypothesis that the
high susceptibility to severe COVID-19 in patients with chronic respiratory diseases could be
explained by a higher expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes in those patients as compared
to controls.

Notably, the expression of ACE2 and cathepsin L is significantly and considerably decreased
in nasal epithelial cells of patients with allergic respiratory disease, including both allergic
asthma and allergic rhinitis, compared with healthy controls. This observation is in line with
findings in recent two studies in which ACE2 expression in airway epithelial cells in patient
with asthma and healthy subjects were reported 55, 56. Taken together, this suggests that type 2
inflammatory processes might modulate the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry related genes.

Accordingly, it is conceivable that patients with allergic respiratory diseases might be less
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, this speculation needs to be verified by
investigating the prevalence of COVID-19 in those populations. Also, further exploration of
the role of type 2 immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection could help to control the
pandemic.

The most striking effect on the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L was observed
in rhinovirus infection. Both experimental infection with rhinovirus in vivo and stimulation
with virus in vitro led to a dramatic upregulation of the ACE2 expression. Moreover, poly(I:C)
which mimics the viral stimulation also shows a similar effect. Recently, Ziegler et al.
demonstrated that ACE2 is an interferon stimulated gene in human airway epithelial cells 51.
The current study also demonstrates that the expression of IFN-ß in airway epithelial cells is
highly upregulated after rhinovirus infection or poly(I:C) stimulation, supporting that ACE2,
as well as TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L are interferon stimulated genes. Since rhinoviruses are
major pathogens of common colds 57, it will be interesting to determine the effect of common
cold on the susceptibility and severity of COVID-19.

In conclusion, this study provides an overview of the expression profile of SARS-CoV-2
entry associated genes in human airway epithelial cells under various physiological and
pathological conditions. The results from this study implicate that respiratory viral infection,
cigarette smoking and allergic respiratory diseases might affect the entry of the SARS-CoV-2
and consequent development of COVID-19.

Methods
Data retrieval
An

exhaustive

search

of

the

Gene

Expression

Omnibus

(GEO)

database

( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) was performed to identify eligible data on 1st June 2020.
The procedure of identification of eligible data is shown in Figure 1. First of all, the key word
“Airway epithelial cells” was used for the search without any limitations. In a second step,
non-human datasets, non-series datasets and non-gene expression array datasets were filtered
out. Finally, datasets from step two were reviewed carefully, and the following datasets were
excluded: (a) datasets of cell line(s), (b) redundant dataset, (c) datasets containing only one
group and (d) datasets containing less than 5 samples per group.
Data correction, normalization
For affymetrix microarrays, CEL files were uploaded into RStudio (Version 1.3.959, based on
R version 4.0.1) using package “affy”

58

. Subsequently, background correction and

normalization were applied to the raw data using “Robust Multichip Average (RMA)” method
59

. For agilent microarray data, raw expression profiling files were uploaded into RStudio

using package “limma”

60

. By using the “limma” package, background correction and

normalization were performed using “normexp” and “quantile” methods, respectively.
Background corrected, normalized and log2 transformed signal intensities of ACE2,
TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L were outputted and used for further analysis.
Meta analysis

All meta-analysis were performed using “meta” package in RStudio. Standardised mean
difference (SMD) was utilized to assess the effect size of a factor on the expression of
targeted genes, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of SMD was calculated

61

. According to

the guideline proposed by Cohen62, the magnitude of the SMD is interpreted as below: small,
SMD = 0.2; medium, SMD = 0.5; and large, SMD = 0.8. Fixed or random effect model was

applied to pool the effect size depending on the heterogeneity across the datasets determined
by inconsistency (I2) statistics and Cochrane's Q test. random effect model was applied when
there was significant heterogeneity among datasets (I2 value > 50% or P value of Q test
< 0.05), otherwise fixed effect model was utilized 63, 64.

Statistics
All statistical analyses were conducted using RStudio. Statistical significance between two
groups was calculated using paired or unpaired Student’s t test depending on the samples. For
the study containing two categorical factors, we utilized two-way ANOVA to determine the
statistical difference followed by Tukey’s test for post hoc analysis. Multiple linear regression
model was generated to evaluate the correlation of lung function index of COPD patients and
healthy controls with gene expression of ACE2. A P value<0.05 was considered as statistical
significance.
