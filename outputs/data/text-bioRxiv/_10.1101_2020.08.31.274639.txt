Abstract
There is an urgent need for anti-viral agents that treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. The shortest path to clinical
use is repurposing of drugs that have an established safety profile in humans. Here, we first screened a
library of 1,900 clinically safe drugs for inhibiting replication of OC43, a human beta-coronavirus that
causes the common-cold and is a relative of SARS-CoV-2, and identified 108 effective drugs. We further
evaluated the top 26 hits and determined their ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, as well as other pathogenic
RNA viruses. 20 of the 26 drugs significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells (A549
epithelial cell line), with EC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 8 micromolar. We investigated the mechanism
of action for these and found that masitinib, a drug originally developed as a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor
for cancer treatment, strongly inhibited the activity of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease 3CLpro. X-ray
crystallography revealed that masitinib directly binds to the active site of 3CLpro, thereby blocking its
enzymatic activity. Mastinib also inhibited the related viral protease of picornaviruses and blocked
picornaviruses replication. Thus, our results show that masitinib has broad anti-viral activity against two
distinct beta-coronaviruses and multiple picornaviruses that cause human disease and is a strong
candidate for clinical trials to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Introduction
On January 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was identified as the causative agent of a new respiratory syndrome that
was later named Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19)1. The virus has rapidly spread throughout the world,
causing an ongoing pandemic, with over 25 million confirmed cases and over 850,000 deaths (as of August
30th 2020)2. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of Coronaviridae, a family of enveloped, single-strand, positive-sense
RNA viruses with a relatively large genome3. This family includes both human and animal pathogens,
including two other emerging human pathogens (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) as well four endemic human
viruses that are the second most common cause of the common cold (HCoV-OC43, 229E, NL63 and
HKU1)4.
Upon entry into the host cell cytoplasm, the viral genome is translated into a polyprotein that
must be cleaved into the individual viral proteins for infection to proceed. This cleavage is mediated by
two virally encoded proteases: the main viral protease, known as Mpro, 3CLpro or non-structural protein
5 (nsp5) and a second protease known as the papain-like protease, PLpro, a domain within nsp33. There
is much interest in developing de-novo inhibitors to target these proteases5–10 but the full clinical
development of such drugs is a time-consuming process, usually requiring several years.

While several promising vaccine candidates have entered human clinical trials11, their success is
not guaranteed. Moreover, even if some are approved, it will be some time until both production and
vaccination efforts can reach the levels needed to control this global outbreak. Therefore, there is a need
for new treatment options for COVID-19. While the antiviral remdesivir, an RNA-dependent RNApolymerase inhibitor originally developed to treat Hepatitis C virus and later repurposed for Ebola, did
receive an emergency use authorization from the FDA due to its ability to shorten COVID-19
hospitalization times12, there are currently no FDA-approved specific antivirals for treating SARS-CoV-2
infection and the introduction of additional antivirals would help to reduce morbidity and mortality.
One obvious way to speed up drug discovery is through the use of drug-repurposing screens,
looking to identify safe-in-human drugs with potential anti-coronavirus properties9,13,14. Here, we
employed a three-tiered approach for drug repurposing, to identify potential broad-spectrum anticoronavirus drugs that specifically target the viral main protease, 3CLpro. We first screened a library of
1,900 safe-in-human drugs for their ability to inhibit HCoV-OC43 infection. HCoV-OC43 is a biosafety level
2 (BSL2) agent and a relatively safe model organism that enables the study of coronavirus infections
outside of high biocontainment facilities. We then validated the anti-viral properties of the top hits against
SARS-CoV-2, and finally investigated the drugs’ ability to inhibit the enzymatic activity of the main SARSCoV-2 protease 3CLpro.
We report here on the identification of 20 safe-in-human drugs that are able to inhibit SARS-CoV2 infection in human lung cells and on the mechanism of action of one of these, masitinib (a tyrosinekinase inhibitor) - which we find to be a bone-fide 3CLpro inhibitor with broad anti coronaviruses and
picornaviruses activity.
Results
A drug repurposing screen against the human beta coronavirus OC43 identifies multiple drugs that are
effective against SARS-CoV-2
We began by screening a library of 1,900 clinically used drugs, either approved for human use or with
extensive safety data in humans (Phase 2 or 3 clinical trials), for their ability to inhibit OC43 infection of
the human lung epithelial cell line A549 (expressing an H2B-mRuby nuclear reporter). One day after
plating, cells were infected at an MOI of 0.3, incubated at 33oC for 1 hour and drugs were added to a final
concentration of 10µM. Cells were then incubated at 33oC for 4 days, fixed and stained for the presence

of the viral nucleoprotein (Fig. 1A). We imaged the cells at day 0 (following drug addition) and day 4 (after
staining) to determine the drugs effect on cell growth and OC43 infection.
We repeated the screen twice and identified 108 drugs that significantly reduced OC43 infection
without significant cellular toxicity (Fig. 1B, Fig. S1, Table S1). Of our top hits, we selected 29 drugs for
further validation. We determined the EC50 values (drug concentration required to reduce infection by
50%) of these drugs against OC43 infection (Fig. 1C, Fig. S2). All of the drugs except erythromycin inhibited
OC43 infection in a dose-dependent manner, with EC50 values ranging from 0.04-7µM. The most potent
drugs in inhibiting OC43 infection were amphotericin B (an anti-fungal drug, EC50=0.04µM), elbasvir (an
anti-viral against HCV, EC50=0.17µM), cediranib (an EGFR inhibitor, EC50=0.52µM) and cepharanthine (an
anti-inflammatory drug, EC50=0.77µM). Remdesivir inhibited OC43 infection in the same cells with an
EC50 value of 0.9µM.
We proceeded to determine the EC50 values for 26 of these drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In a high biocontainment (BSL3) facility, A549 cells over-expressing the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) receptor were treated with the drugs for 2 hours, infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.5,
incubated for 2 days, fixed, and stained for the viral spike protein (as a marker of SARS-CoV-2 infection).
After staining, the cells were imaged under a microscope to quantify the fraction of infected cells. Of the
26 drugs tested, 20 (77%) inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 2A, Fig. S3).
Interestingly, the most potent drugs against OC43 infection (amphotericin B and elbavir) did not inhibit
SARS-CoV-2 infection. The pleiotropic drug cepharanthine was the most potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2
infection (EC50=0.13µM), followed by flupenthixol (an anti-psychotic, EC50=0.56µM) and desloratidine
(an anti-histamine, EC50=0.9µM). In comparison, remdesivir inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection with an EC50
value of 0.1µM. A comparison of the EC50 values obtained against OC43 and SARS-CoV-2, as well as the
chemical structures of the drugs, is shown in Table S2. Many of the identified drugs are anti-psychotic and
anti-allergic drugs that share a similar tricyclic structure, in agreement with the previous identification of
olanzapine (a tricyclic anti-depressant) as an anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug13.
We further evaluated the effect of several drugs on the production of viable progeny viruses. Cells
were treated with 10µM of the drugs for 2 hours, infected at an MOI of 0.5 and the supernatant collected
2 days after for titration (Fig. 2B). Cepharanthine, azelastine, and masitinib completely eliminated SARSCoV-2 progeny production (>5-logs decrease), while flupenthixol and desloratidine reduced viral titers by
about 2-logs. Ultimately, our screen identified 20 safe-in-human drugs that are able to inhibit both OC43
and SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.

Masitinib is a bone-fide 3CLpro inhibitor
We next examined the drugs ability to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (also known as 3CLpro, Mpro
and nsp5). 3CLpro is an attractive target for anti-viral drugs, as it indispensable for the viral replication
cycle and is well conserved among coronaviruses15. We first tested the ability of 20 drugs that inhibited
both SARS-CoV-2 and OC43 infection to inhibit 3CLpro activity in 293T cells transfected with a FlipGFP
reporter system16 at a single concentration of 10µM. In this assay, 3CLpro cleavage of the FlipGFP reporter
is needed to produce GFP fluorescence, and thus the level of GFP+ cells reports on 3CLpro activity. 8 drugs
showed a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of GFP-expressing cells - retapamulin,
conivaptan, bafetinib, raloxifene, imatinib, lapatinib, vilazodone and masitinib (Fig. 3A, Fig. S4). Standing
out among these was masitinib, a c-kit/PDGFR inhibitor in multiple phase 3 clinical trials, which completely
inhibited 3CLpro activity. Masitinib preferentially binds and inhibits the mutant form of c-kit17 and has
been approved for treatment of mast-cell tumors in dogs18. Masitinib was also evaluated in phase 2 and
3 clinical trials in humans for the treatment of cancer19, asthma20, Alzheimer’s21, multiple sclerosis22 and
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis23.
Therefore, we proceeded to determine the IC50 value (the drug concentration that causes a 50%
reduction in enzymatic activity) of masitinib inhibition of 3CLpro activity in two distinct cellular assays; the
same FlipGFP reporter assay described above (Fig. 3B), as well as a luciferase reporter assay adapted for
SARS-CoV-224 (Fig. 3C). These assays, performed independently at the University of Chicago and Duke
University, determined the IC50 value to be 2.5µM (Fig. 3B,C), similar to the EC50 values determined
against OC43 (2.1µM, Fig. 1C) and SARS-CoV-2 (3.2µM, Fig. 2A) infections, suggesting that masitinib
inhibition of coronavirus infection is achieved by inhibiting 3CLpro activity.
We additionally evaluated the IC50 value of masitinib using a novel cell-free assay with purified
3CLpro and a methyl-amino coumarin (AMC)-tagged peptide, whose fluorescent signal is uncaged upon
3CLpro proteolytic activity (Fig. 3D, IC50 = 35 µM. See Methods for complete description of the assay).
While this assay determined a higher IC50 value than the cell-based assays, it strongly suggested that
direct interaction of masitinib with the viral protease is responsible for its effects on SARS-CoV-2
replication.
Masitinib inhibits 3CLpro by directly binding to its active site
To obtain further mechanistic understating of the mode of 3CLpro inhibition by masitinib we determined
the high-resolution structure of masitinib-bound 3CLpro using X-ray crystallography (Fig. 4). The structure

indicates that masitinib binds non-covalently into the shallow, elongated grove between domains I and II
of 3CLpro and is crossing the 3CLpro active site. The enzyme is a dimer and both active sites are occupied
by masitinib. Specifically, masitinib’s pyridine ring packs into the S1 substrate pocket of 3CLpro peptide
recognition site25. In addition to hydrophobic and Van der Waals interactions between the ring and its
surrounding pocket-forming residues, it forms a hydrogen bond with His163, located at the bottom of the
S1 pocket. Masitinib’s aminothiazole ring forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of His164 and interacts
directly with the key catalytic residue - Cys145. The second catalytic residue, His41, forms a nearly perfect
π-π stacking with masitinib’s hydrophobic toluene ring that occupies the S2 binding pocket. These three
active groups (pyridine, aminothiazole and toluene rings) contribute the majority of interactions between
masitinib and 3CLpro, bind the key active site residues and effectively block the peptide substrate access
to the protease catalytic dyad26, thus preventing polyprotein cleavage.
Taken together, our results show that masitinib, originally designed as a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor
and considered for treatment of a number of human diseases, harbors potent anti-coronavirus activity
through its direct binding to and inhibition of the virus main protease.
Masitinib blocks the replication of picornaviruses through the inhibition of their 3C protease
Since masitinib directly binds and inhibits the coronaviruses 3CL protease, we asked if it is also effective
against the 3C protease of picornaviruses (human pathogens that cause a range of diseases including
meningitis, hepatitis, and poliomyelitis) given the extensive structural homology and substrate specificity
shared between these viral proteases27. Using a luciferase reporter assay28, we indeed found that
masitinib significantly inhibited the activity of the 3C protease in cells (Fig. 5A). Masitinib was also effective
in blocking the replication of multiple picornaviruses (Fig. 5B) but not of other RNA viruses (Fig. S5). Thus,
we conclude that masitinib is a relatively broad-spectrum anti-viral, able to inhibit multiple corona- and
picorna- viruses, but not other RNA viruses that do not rely on a 3CL-like protease to complete their life
cycle.
Discussion
In conclusion, we have shown that OC43, a BSL-2 pathogen that can be readily studied in most virological
labs, is a good model system to screen potential anti-viral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infection, since most
drugs that inhibited OC43 replication also inhibited SARS-CoV-2 in our measurements. We identified 20
safe-in-human drugs that should be considered for advancement for clinical trials and identified masitinib
as a direct anti-viral agent that binds and inhibits 3CLpro.

While masitinib binds to 3CLpro in a non-covalent manner, it shows better efficacy against SARSCoV-2 replication in vitro than the recently reported covalent, pre-clinical, 3CLpro inhibitor 13b29. While
masitinib’s EC50 value is higher than that of two other, pre-clinical, covalent inhibitors, 11a and 11b10, it
showed superior inhibition of progeny production at 10µM (over 5-logs for masitinib, compared to 2-logs
for 11a and 11b).
It is important to note that in addition to the direct anti-viral effect we have uncovered here,
masitinib has been shown to decrease airway inflammation and improve lung functions in a feline model
of asthma30. Given that a main pathology of SARS-CoV-2 is ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome),
the combined anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties of masitinib might prove highly beneficial for
treating COVID-19.
Though here we highlighted masitinib, given its direct inhibitory effect on the viral main protease,
we emphasize that the other drugs we identified as SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors should also be investigated
more. Topical drugs in particular represent an interesting class of drugs for further exploration. These
drugs could be considered for use as prophylactics in high risk populations, such as healthcare workers,
due to their ease of use, favorable safety profile, and local delivery of high doses to areas of viral
replication. In addition to azelastine (a nasally administered antihistamine used to treat rhinitis), which
we have shown inhibits both OC43 (Fig. 1C) and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2), several of the identified hits in our
primary screen against OC43 are also administered topically to either the nose or lungs (Table S1). These
include salmeterol, budesonide, beclomethasone, fluticasone, and xylometazoline.
Future efforts should evaluate the efficacy of the identified drugs in preventing or treating
COVID19 patients as well as decipher the mechanism by which these drugs are able to inhibit betacoronaviruses replication. While any single agent anti-viral therapy is likely to cause viral adaption and the
emergence of resistance mutants, a previous work suggested that CoVs that escape 3CLpro inhibition by
mutating the protease show decreased replication and pathogensis31. The identification of direct antivirals that target multiple distinct aspects of the viral life cycle (such as the polymerase, proteases, helicase
etc.) will allow the design of combination therapies that have proven highly beneficial against other RNA
viruses, such as HIV and HCV.

Methods
Cells
A549 expressing H2B-mRuby were generated by first infecting A549 cells (ATCC CCL-185) with a lentivirus
(carrying H2B-mRuby), and FACS-sorting mRuby+ cells. They were maintained as a polyclonal population
and grown in DMEM+10% BCS (Bovine Calf Serum). These cells were used for all OC43 infections. Ace2A54932 cells were used for SARS-CoV-2 infections and were a kind gift of Benjamin TenOever, Mt Sinai
Icahn School of Medicine. They were maintained in DMEM + 10% FBS. African green monkey kidney cells
(Vero E6), kindly provided by J.L. Whitton, were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1%
penicillin-streptomycin and 1% HEPES. We used Huh7 cells for picornaviruses infections. MDCK-SIAT1TMPRSS2 cells, obtained from Jesse Bloom, were used for IAV infections. A549 cells maintained in 50:50
DMEM:F-12 media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin were used for LCMV
infections.
Viruses
OC43 was obtained from ATCC (VR-1558) grown and titrated on A549-mRuby cells. SARS-CoV-2
(nCoV/Washington/1/2020) was provided by the National Biocontainment Laboratory, Galveston, TX.
VeroE6 cells were used to propagate and titer SARS-CoV-2. CVB3 (Nancy strain), HRV 2, 14, and 16 were
derived from full-length infectious clones and generated in Vero cells (NR-10385, BEI Resources, NIAID,
NIH). Rhinovirus infectious clones were provided by Dr. Bill Jackson. Recombinant LCMV based on the
Armstrong 53b strain was generated as previously described33,34. Working stocks were generated in Vero
E6 cells, and the same cells were used to measure virus titers. The Measles Virus used was derived from
the molecular cDNA clone of the Moraten/Schwartz vaccine strain35. The recombinant Measles virus was
engineered to express firefly luciferase as previously described36.
Drug screening
A549-mRuby cells were seeded (3,000 cells per well) in nine 384-well plates using Multidrop combi. Cells
were seeded in a final volume of 30ul with DMEM+10% BCS. The following day, 20ul of OC43 were added
(MOI 0.3) and incubated at 33°C, 5% CO2 for 1 hour. 50nl from the Selleck FDA-approved drug library (cat
#L1300, Selleck) were added (1:1,000 dilution). Two columns (32 wells) were left uninfected and two
columns were treated with DMSO and virus (no drug control). Cells were imaged using the IncuCyte S3 to
measure cell numbers at day 0. Cells were incubated for 4 days at 33°C, 5% CO2 and were stained for
OC43 nucleoprotein. All the following steps were performed at room temperature. Cells were fixed in 50ul

4% PFA/PBS for 15 min, blocked with 50ul 10% BSA+0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 minutes, stained with
50ul anti-OC43 (cat # MAB9013, Milipore) diluted 1:2,000 in 2% BSA+0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 hour,
washed with 50ul PBS three times, stained with anti-mouse-AlexaFluor488 diluted 1:1,000 in 2%
BSA+0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 hour, washed with 50ul PBS three times and imaged on the IncuCyte
S3 (day 4). The screen was performed twice.
The following parameters were extracted from the images: number of cells at day 0, number of
cells at ay 4 and total OC43 staining intensity at day 4. For analysis, OC43 staining intensity was normalized
to the number of cells in the well and further normalized to the mean of the no drug controls, which was
set to 100. We removed from analysis compounds that showed significant effect on cell growth. For each
plate, we considered a drug as a putative hit if it reduced OC43 staining by over 3 standard deviations
from the mean of the no drug controls. Drugs were considered hits if they were not toxic and reduced
OC43 staining by over 3 standard deviations in both repeats. The full list of screened drugs, as well as their
effect on cell growth and OC43 staining is summarized in Table S1.
Dose-response analysis for OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 infection
Dose-response analysis of OC43 infection was done similarly to the drug screening, except cells were
seeded at a concentration of 5,000 cells per well and the media contained 2% BCS instead of 10% BCS.
OC43 staining was performed 2 days after infection and analyzed similarly to what was described for the
drug screening. A sigmoid fit was used to extract EC50 values using Matlab. In a few cases we were unable
to fit a sigmoid curve to the data and EC50 values were estimated from the graphs (these are denoted by
~ in Fig. S2).
All SARS-CoV-2 infections were performed in biosafety level 3 conditions at the Howard T. Ricketts
Regional Biocontainment Laboratory. Ace2-A549 cells in DMEM +2% FBS were treated with drugs for 2
hours with 2-fold dilutions beginning at 10M in triplicate for each assay. Cells were infected with an MOI
of 0.5 in media containing the appropriate concentration of drugs. After 48 hours, the cells were fixed
using 3.7% formalin, blocked and probed with mouse anti-Spike antibody (GTX632604, GeneTex) diluted
1:1,000 for 4 hours, rinsed and probed with anti-mouse-HRP for 1 hour, washed, then developed with

1.25% methylcellulose DMEM solution was added to the cells and incubated for 3 days. Plates were fixed
in 1:10 formalin for 1 hour, stained with crystal violet for 1 hour and were counted to determine plaque
forming units (PFU)/ml.
FlipGFP SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro Assay
293T cells were seeded 24 hours before transfection on poly-lysine treated plates. The next day, SARSCoV-2 3CLpro plasmid, FlipGFP coronavirus reporter plasmid, Opti-MEM, and TransIT-LT (Mirus) were
combined and incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes before being added to the cells. Drugs were
applied to the cells at the indicated concentrations at the time of transfection. 24 hours after transfection,
cells were fixed with 2% PFA at room temperature for 20 minutes and were incubated in 1:10,000 Hoescht
33342 (Life Technologies) in PBS at 4°C overnight. Quantification was performed by using the CellInsight
CX5 (Thermo Scientific) equipment.

3CLpro luciferase reporter assay
Approximately 16 hours before transfection, 293T cells were plated in 96-well plates and grown to 7080% confluency overnight. The next day, we transfected the cells with 37.5 ng pGlo-30F-VRLQS, 37.5 ng
SARS-CoV2 3CLpro, and 2.5 ng pRL-TK (Promega) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) using
manufacture’s recommendations. After 18 hours, masitinib (0-10µM) was added to the cells and
incubated for an additional 6 hours before luciferase readout on a Biotek Synergy plate reader as
previously described24. Briefly, 40 µL growth media was removed from every well and then 40 µL firefly
assay buffer (Triton Lysis Buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 75 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.25% Triton X-100)
containing 5 mM DTT, 0.2 mM coenzyme A, 0.15 mM ATP, and 1.4 mg/mL D-luciferin) was added to lyse
the cells, and to provide the substrate for firefly luciferase. Firefly luminescence was read 10 minutes later
and 40 µL Renilla assay buffer (45 mM EDTA, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1.4 M NaCl, 0.02 mM PTC124,
0.003 mM coelentrazine h (CTZ-h)) was added to stop firefly luciferase activity and provide the substrate
for Renilla luciferase. Renilla luminescence was read 2-3 minutes after addition of the buffer. Firefly
luciferase luminescence was normalized to the corresponding Renilla luciferase luminescence to generate
normalized luminescence.

3CLpro kinetic assay
The cell-free inhibition assay was done in triplicates at 25°C using 96-well plates. Reactions containing the
different concentrations of masitinib (0-1,000 µM) and 3CLpro enzyme (0.4 µM) in Tris-HCl pH 7.3, 1 mM
EDTA were incubated for approximately five minutes. Reactions were then initiated with Ac-TVLQ-AMC

probe substrate (40 µM), shaken linearly for 5 seconds. Fluorescence emission intensity (excitation λ: 364
nm; emission λ: 440 nm) was measured continuously (Synergy Neo2 Hybrid). Data were fit using a sigmoid
curve fit in Matlab.

Gene cloning, protein over-expression and purification
Cloning of 3CLpro from SARS CoV-2 was based upon the original cloning of SARS-CoV 3CLpro37. The gene
coding for 3CLpro from SARS CoV-2 was cloned between an upstream MBP and a downstream sequence
of GPHHHHHH. Detailed cloning of pCSGID-Mpro carrying 3CLpro from SARS CoV-2 is described in Kneller
et al26.
pCSGID-Mpro was transformed into 100 ml of E. coli BL21(DE3)-Gold (Strategene) under selection
of ampicillin (150mg/L) and grewn overnight at 37°C. The starter was then transferred to 4 L of LB-Miller,
culture and was grown at 37°C with constant shaking (190 rpm). After reaching an OD600 of ~1, the shaker
was set to 4°C. When temperature reached 18°C, IPTG and K2HPO4 was added to 0.2 mM and 40 mM
respectively and the culture was marinated at 18°C. The cells were spun down at 4000g, resuspended in
lysis buffer (500 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 20 mM imidazole pH 8.0, 1mM TCEP)
and kept frozen at -80°C.
Bacterial cells were lysed by sonication and debris were removed by centrifugation at 25,400 × g
for 60 min at 4oC. The clarified supernatant was mixed with 3 ml of Ni2+ Sepharose (GE Healthcare Life
Sciences) equilibrated with lysis buffer. The suspension was applied to a Flex-Column (420400-2510)
which was connected to a Vac-Man vacuum manifold. Unbound protein was washed out using controlled
suction lysis buffer (160 ml). 3CLpro was eluted using 15 ml of buffer containing 500 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v)
glycerol, 50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 500 mM imidazole pH 8.0 and 1mM TCEP. The fractions containing 3CLpro
were pooled, and rhinovirus 3C His6 tagged protease was added at a 1:25 protease:protein ratio and
incubated at 4 °C overnight to cleave the C-terminal His6 tag, resulting in a 3CLpro with an authentic N
and C-termini. 10 kDa MWCO filter (Amicon-Millipore) was used to concentrate the protein solution,
which was subsequently applied to Superdex 75 column, pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. The fractions
containing 3CLpro were pooled together and run through 2 ml of Ni resin. We collected the flow through
and replaced the lysis buffer with crystallization buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT
(1,4-Dithiothreitol, Roche, Basel, Switzerland)) using a 10 kDa MWCO filter. 3CLpro solution was
concentrated to 49 mg/ml, was aliquoted, frozen and stored at -80oC.

Crystallization of Masitinib with SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro
Crystallization were carried out using previous protocols38. 3CLpro was mixed with 0.2M masitinib solution
in DMSO. The final protein concentration was 6.25 mg/ml and inhibitor concentration was 8 times higher.
This mixture was incubated for 1 hour (at room temperature) and spun down at 12,000 x g to remove
precipitation. For crystallization, we utilized the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method via a Mosquito liquid
dispenser (TTP LabTech, Royston, UK) in 96-well CrystalQuick plates (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC, USA)
using a protein-to-matrix ratio of 1:1. ProPlex, PACT premier (Molecular dimensions, Cambridge, UK), and
TOP96 (Anatrace, Maumee, OH, USA) screens were used for crystallization at 16°C. The first thin-plate
crystals (obtained one day later in several conditions) were applied as seeding. The best crystals appeared
in PACT B7 (0.2M Sodium Chloride, 0.1MES pH 6.0, 20% PEG 6000), TOP96 H8 (0.1M Ammonium Acetate,
0.1M Bis-Tris pH 5.5, 17% PEG 10000) and Top96 F11 (0.1M Bis-Tris pH6.5; 25% PEG 3350). Crystals
selected for data collection were treated in their crystallization buffers supplemented with 10-18%
glycerol and were subsequently flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen.
X-ray data collection and structure determination
Cryo-cooled crystals (100 K) were measured using single-wavelength X-ray diffraction experiments at the
19-ID beamline of the Structural Biology Center, Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory
(we used the SBCcollect program). We integrated, scaled and merged intensities of each data set (HKL3000 program suite was used39). The structure of 3CLpro in complex with masitinib was determined using
the molecular replacement method40 with an apo form of 3CLpro (PDB code: 7JFQ) as a search template.
In the difference Fourier maps, extra electron densities were observed in the substrate binding site of
3CLpro and were subsequently identified as the contribution of masitinib. One data set with a resolution
limit up to 1.60 Å was selected for further model rebuilding, including building masitinib into extra
densities using the program Coot41 and refinement using the program phenix.refine42 (Table 1). We used
MOLPROBITY43 to validate the stereochemistry of the structure (Table 1).

Synthesis of fluorogenic peptide of 3CLpro kinetics assay
General
We performed low resolution mass spectral and liquid chromatography analyses using the Advion
Expression-L mass spectrometer (Ithaca, NY), which was coupled to an Agilent 1220 Infinity LC System.
Synthetic protocols

1. 7-methyl-4-amino coumarin (AMC) (0.5 g, 2.85 mmol, 1.0 eq) was dissolved in dry DMF (10 mL) in a 25
mL round-bottom flask. Boc-glutamine (1.4 g, 5.7 mmol, 2 eq.) was added, followed by DIPEA (1 mL, 5.7
mmol, 2 eq.), Oxyma (0.811 g, 5.7 mmol, 2 eq.) and DIC (530 μL, 3.4 mmol, 1.2 eq.). The reaction mixture
was stirred at room temperature for 4 hours and then heated to 50°C. After stirring overnight, the reaction
was cooled and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification by column chromatography (0-5%
methanol in DCM) yielded 1 (0.552 g, 48%). LRMS-ESI(+): Calculated for C20H25N3O6 [M+H+] 403.17, found
403.2

2. L-leucine methyl ester (0.30 grams, 1.65 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL) and,
following addition of DIPEA (431 μL, 2.48 mmol, 1.5 eq.) the reaction was cooled to 0°C. In a separate
flask, Boc-valine (0.716 g, 3.3 mmol, 2 eq.) and Oxyma (0.352 g, 2.48 mmol, 1.5 eq.) were dissolved in
DCM and stirred for 5 minutes, after which DIC (384 μL, 2.48 mmol, 1.5 eq.) was added. This solution was
then added to the reaction mixture and stirred for two hours while the solution warmed to room
temperature. The solution was then diluted with DCM, washed with brine, and dried over magnesium
sulfate. Purification by column chromatography (0-40% EtOAc in hexanes) yielded 2 (0.445 g, 78%). LRMSESI(+): Calculated for C17H32N2O5 [M+H+] 344.23, found 344.5.

Picornaviruses infection
Prior to infection, Huh7 cells were pretreated for two hours. Virus was diluted using serum-free DMEM
(SFM) to achieve an MOI of 0.01. Cell supernatants (collected at 24 hrs post infection) were dilutions in
SFM and used to inoculate Vero cells for 10-15 min at 37⁰C. Cells were incubated for 2 days at 37⁰C after
overlaying them DMEM containing 2% NBCS and 0.8% agarose. Cells were then fixed with 4% formalin
and revealed with crystal violet solution (10% crystal violet; Sigma-Aldrich). The number of plaque
forming units (PFU/per milliliter) were then calculated.
3C protease activity assay
Huh7 cells were transfected with LipoD293 (SignaGen Laboratories) with 3C substrate, 3C protease
(derived from CVV3) and a Renilla transfection control plasmid (siCheck). Protease and target constructs
were generated using protocols previously described28. The cells were combined with firefly substrate
(Bright-Glo; Promega) followed by subsequent Renilla (Stop and Glo; Promega) luciferase substrate 24
hours post transfection. Assays were performed using the manufacturer’s recommendations (Promega)
and a Veritas Microplate Luminometer (Turner BioSystems) was used to quantify the results.

Influenza A infection
MDCK-SIAT1-TMPRSS2 cells were infected with Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) at an MOI of 0.01
TCID50/cell. Following a 1 hour adsorption, virus was removed and the cells were washed. Viral growth
medium was added with either masitinib or DMSO to a final concentration of 10µM. We harvested and
clarified supernatants at 20 hours post infection. We titrated the supernatants using TCID on MDCKSIAT1-TMPRSS2 cells.
LCMV infection
One day prior to infection, A549 cells were seeded in 12 well dishes (80,000 cells per well). Cells were
infected with rLCMV at an MOI of 0.01 for one hour at 37°C. The inoculum was removed and cells were
overlaid with 1 ml of complete media containing masitinib or DMSO only control. Supernatants were
harvested at 48 hours after infection, were clarified and titrated by a previously described immunofocus assay44,45, using a mouse anti-LCMV nucleoprotein antibody (1-1.3, kindly provided by M.
Buchmeier) and a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (SeraCare).
Measles Virus Inhibition assay
Vero cells were infected with a luciferase-expressing Measles virus at an MOI of 0.01 for 90 minutes. We
removed the inoculum and added fresh medium containing masitinib or DMSO to the cells for further
culture. Three days later, firefly luciferase activity was measured by adding 0.5mM of D-Luciferin to each
well and was quantified with an Infinite M200 Pro multimode microplate reader.
Statistical analyses
For all experiment described, the size of the sample (n) refers to independent biological samples tested.
All analyses were performed in Matlab. Multiple-comparison corrections was performed using the FDR
method.
