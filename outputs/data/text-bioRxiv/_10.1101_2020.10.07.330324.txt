The world is faced with a pandemic disease, COVID-19, caused by the emergence and global

often caused by pulmonary problems associated with severe respiratory symptoms, this virus continues
treatment. While the causative agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, is similar to other coronaviruses that
infect humans and animals, many molecular details of this virus's macromolecular structures and

functions remain unknown. Immunological approaches to neutralize the virus, using both passive (e.g.

injection of antibodies into patients) or active (e.g., injection of DNA, mRNA or protein that generates a

neutralizing immune response) immunity are being pursued by scientists in both the private and public
sectors. Since it is unclear whether any of these methods will succeed, it is prudent to explore other

approaches to treat this disease, including drug therapy. Small molecule drug therapy has been highly
successful in controlling HIV-1 infections and curing infections of hepatitis C virus 4-7. Creating small

novel strategies to combat this disease as well as potentially new emerging viruses that use similar

Here, we characterize the nucleotidyl transferase activity in SARS-CoV-2 replicase proteins by the

residues that were critical in EAV nsp9 nucleotidyl transferase activity, as well as mutation of the

59

(Nidovirus RdRP associated nucleotidyltransferase) that is also conserved in SARS-CoV-2 1-3 . Mutation of
corresponding residues in SARS-CoV nsp12, eliminated viral propagation 3. However, there has been no
definitive direct chemical analysis of the bond covalently linking the nucleotides to the protein, nor the
exact chemical structure of the modification and the amino acids in which it occurs.

In order to utilize mass spectrometric technologies to provide definitive chemical data on the

60

nucleotidylation event in nidoviruses, we first confirmed the earlier report of nucleotidyl transferase

62

(Mr~25,200), which binds nsp9 and plays an important role in viral propagation10,11. Nucleotidyated

61

activity in EAV. We incubated nsp9 (Mr~76,800) together with Î±-32P-GTP and a 2-4 molar excess of nsp7

63

products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining and autoradiography (Fig. 1). The

convention, the numbering of nonstructural proteins that comprise the RdRP of EAV is independent of
that in SARS-CoV-2 and reflects their position within the viral polyprotein, not their function). The

proteins were kept at low temperatures and neutral pH to stabilize labile, phosphoramide linkages
between GMP and protein (Extended Data Fig. 1) 3,12,13. Although EAV nsp9 alone was sufficient to

observe protein nucleotidylation3, the addition of nsp7 resulted in higher levels of radionucleotide

71

incorporation into both proteins (Fig. 1, Extended Data Fig. 2). In contrast, full length SARS-CoV-2 nsp12

In our assay, a mutation of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 that replaced a basic amino acid with a neutral amino

acid, i.e. K73A, abolished all incorporation of radioactivity in nsp7 and nsp8, further demonstrating the

central role of this nsp12 RdRP protein in nucleotidyation. Promiscuous labeling of a non-relevant

exhibits substrate specificity, possibly through close localization of proteins within the macromolecular

We next utilized heavy isotope incorporation and the high mass accuracy of a tribrid Orbitrap

82

based mass spectrometer to confirm that the transfer of radioactivity to the nsp proteins was a result of

84

of natural GTP or, alternatively, GTP containing the heavy isotopes 15N or 13C. This allowed us to identify

83

85

nucleotidylation. We performed nucleotidylation reactions in the absence of nucleotide, in the presence
GMP-labeled peptide peaks using LC-MS alone, independent of MS/MS spectrum acquisition and

86

matching. Unlabeled nsp peptides that were present in all sample injections ran at similar retention

88

identified by two criteria (Fig. 2b): (1) their absence in unlabeled sample injections, and (2) the presence

87
89

90

times (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 3). LC-MS peaks that corresponded to GMP-labeled peptides were

of appropriately mass-shifted peptides at the same retention time in samples that were labeled with 15N-

and 13C-GTP. Although a typical SARS-CoV-2 sample had ~13,000 different LC-MS peaks, only three peaks

91

were found that met the above criteria of GMP-labeled peptides (Extended Data Fig. 4, Supplementary

93

peaks satisfied the specified criteria as GMP modified candidates (Extended Data Fig.5, Supplementary

92

Tables 1 and 2). Similarly, the sample set for EAV nsp proteins contained ~91,000 peaks, but only 50

For the next step of analysis, candidate peaks were subjected to MS/MS analysis in the tribrid

algorithm (also see Supplementary Table 4)

18,19.

In SARS-CoV-2, we could only verify a single GMP-

101

modified site by MS/MS located at ser-2 of the nsp7 recombinant protein, which is the N-terminal ser-1

103

identified. For EAV, five total sites were identified in nsp proteins. This included nucleotidyation of nsp7

102

104

105

107

residue in the nsp7 protein produced by the virus. Multiple forms of this same modified peptide were

lys-143, which was observed in multiple peptides, and one site in nsp9. All GMP linkages in the EAV nsp
proteins occurred via a phosphoramidite (P-N) bond rather than the O-linked GMP found in SARS CoV-2
(Table 1).

Compared to HCD, EThcD spectra provided clean, higher-quality, and more interpretable data that

108

had improved spectrum matching scores (Xcorrelation scores) and that contained both N-terminal and C-

110

- 9). Preservation of the GMP attachment allowed us to determine the modification site. However, some

113

114

115

terminal fragment ions (c- ion series and z-,y- ion series, respectively) (Fig. 2c, Fig. 3, Extended Data Fig. 6
loss of the GMP modification during fragmentation was observed. One example is the 1438.73035 ion in
Figure 2c that corresponds to the z13+ fragment that lost the GMP modification. If not for the presence of
the y13+ ion at 1798.78857, it would be easy to assign the GMP attachment site to the N-terminal glycine
residue instead.

The most prominent feature in HCD spectra was the fragmentation of the GMP moiety itself that,

116

in every instance, leaves a characteristic and dominant guanine (C5N5OH6) tracer ion (Table 1, Fig. 3, and

versions of GMP are 152.0572, 157.0740 or 157.0424, respectively. Peptide ions that do not contain the
modification were prominent in these HCD spectra. For example, when the modification was located

closer to the N-terminus, the y-ion series is easily identified, and the b-ion series is missing (Fig. 3a, b).

Similarly, when the modification is closer to the C-terminus, the b-ion series is prominent, and the y-ion

962.95 and 953.95 ions m/z in Figure 3c.

Until now, successful MS identification for GMP-peptide adducts has not been demonstrated. The

130

results reported here allow a more systematic and high-throughput method to find such sites. We show

that EThcD fragmentation is favorable over HCD fragmentation because both sets of the N- and C-

fragmentation causes destruction of the GMP molecule, similar to what occurs with glycan PTMs in the

collisional-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation technique that is comparable to HCD 20,21. However,
HCD can be a powerful diagnostic tool used to locate peptides that are GMP-modified because, without

exception, the dominant MS/MS ion is always a guanine at a m/z of 152.0572. AMP-peptide adducts have

been examined by MS/MS using CID 22. These spectra also featured destruction and loss of the nucleotide
modification that could make peptide identification difficult. However, fragmentation of the AMP moiety

left diagnostic ions at 136.1 and 250.1 that could be used to locate modified peptides in complex mixtures.
We failed to identify GMP-modified sites in SARS-CoV-2 nsp8, even though the proteins were

141

clearly labeled with radioactivity in the gel-based assay. Although we utilized a variety of proteases to

examine our samples by LC-MS, it is possible that the modified peptides could not easily be isolated

to produce a strong MS signal. GMP-modification added hydrophobicity to some peptides as they eluted

with higher organic solvent on a reverse phase column compared to their unmodified counterparts (Fig.
2a vs 2b). It is also possible that the stability of GMP attachment is dependent on the chemical

environment provided by neighboring amino acids. Additionally, attachment to amides through the

formation of phosphoramide bonds is known to be unstable in acid conditions used in LC-MS (Extended

nsp7 in the mass spectrometer could be the manifestation of a lys-3 GMP-modification via a

residue during the sample handling. It should be noted that non-canonical phosphorylation on basic

amino acids, which uses identical phosphoramidate chemistry (i.e., the P-N bond versus P-O in S, T and Y
amino acids) for the GMP linkage, is beginning to emerge as an important component of signaling

systems in nature 16,23. These phosphoramidate bonds are more labile under the conditions commonly

used in analytical instrumentation such as HPLC and mass spectrometry and are therefore understudied.

This highlights the need for more comprehensive studies that examine the impact of additional factors on
their in vivo and in vitro lability, such as the specific local chemical environment provided by unique
amino acid sequences on either side of the modified residue.

Nucleotidyl transferase activity plays a role in diverse biological processes in bacteria, viruses and

161

eukaryotes. The addition of AMP (AMPylation or adenylation) was first described as a mechanism to

163

and viral RNA synthesis 32 where nucleotides are stably attached to serine,

threonine or tyrosine resides 33,34. AMP and GMP adducts are also formed as intermediates in RNA

capping 12,35,36, DNA ligation 37,38, SUMOylation and ubiquitinylation 39-43 as well as other enzymatic
reactions 44,45. In these cases, as with non-canonical phosphorylation of lysine and histidine, the

nucleotide forms less stable linkages with amine (lysine or histidine) or carboxyl groups that promote its
transfer to substrate.

Here we have demonstrated nucleotidylation activity of SARS-CoV-2 proteins that is hypothesized

171

to be critical for viral propagation 3. Mutation of nsp12 K73 caused a loss of transferase activity, which

Importantly, the NiRAN domain (residues 1-250) is distant from the RNA polymerase active site

172

indicates the N-terminal NiRAN domain is necessary for formation of GMP adducts on nsp7 and nsp8.

foundation for future studies defining the exact mechanistic and functional purposes of this novel

nucleotidylation activity in SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses. The translational utility of this

information for discovering and/or designing new inhibitors of the process that function to thwart

COVID-19 is an important future goal for research on SARS-CoV-2 as well as unknown but potentially

Figure 2. Detection of a GMP-modified SARS-CoV-2 peptide using LC-MS/MS. a,
Extracted Ion chromatograms at the indicated m/z (+/- 5 ppm) show the precursor peptide
MS1 signals versus retention time for the SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 peptide 1-14 with a charge of +2.
Signals are shown for samples that were incubated without GTP (no nucleotide), with GTP, or
with a mixture of GTP, 15N-GTP and 13C-GTP (top, middle and lower panels, respectively). b,
MS1 signals at the m/z of 928.4078 for the same samples are shown (left panel). This mass
corresponds to the GMP-modified version of the same peptide with a charge state of +2. The
average mass spectrum across these peaks is shown from the m/z range of 927 â 938 in
order to visualize the presence or absence of the isotopic mass envelops for the GMP-labeled
peptide and the corresponding 15N- and 13C-labeled GMP peptides (right panel). For the
unlabeled sample, average mass spectrum for retention times of ~45.68 â 45.78 is shown.
The inset indicates the mass added to any peptide modified by GMP, 15N-GMP and 13C-GMP
as well as the mass differences between the GMP-labeled and the heavy-labeled GMP peptides for the specified charge states (z). c,The top-scoring EThcD peptide spectrum match for
same GMP-labeled peptide is shown with labeling of main fragment ions. Inset shows an
abbreviated list of expected peptide mass fragments, which are colored red or blue if they
were matched in the spectrum within an error of 0.04 Daltons. Note that not all matched ions
are labeled in the spectrum.

Figure 3. MS/MS spectra of GMP, 15N-GMP and 13C-GMP modified peptides fragmented with
HCD. Examples of top-scoring HCD peptide spectrum matches from two EAV nsp7 peptides are
shown that are either labeled closer to the N-terminus (a, b) or the C-terminus (c). Each spectrum
represents a peptide modified with either GMP, 15N-GMP or 13C-GMP as indicated. Inset lists expected fragment ions in an identical manner as in Figure 2c. Spectra are additionally labeled with guanine fragment ions and dominant peptide fragments that have lost the GMP modified plus one or two
H2O molecules. Note that Sequest HT assigned the GMP modification site for the spectrum in panel
c to R17, instead of the correct site at K16.

Methods

Expression and purification of the EAV and SARS-CoV-2 proteins

DNA for SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 encompassing the a.a. 1-932 and EAV nsp9 1-693 was synthesized

with codon optimization (Genscript) and cloned into pFastBac with an N-terminal MG addition and C-

terminal TEV protease site and two Strep tags. Expression was performed by transducing

recombinant baculoviruses into Sf21 insect cells (Expression Systems). Cells were harvested by

centrifugation and resuspended in 25 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 300 mM sodium chloride, 1 mM magnesium

chloride, and 2 mM dithiothreitol. The resuspended cells were then lysed using a microfluidizer,

clarified by centrifugation at 25,000 Ã g for 30 min and filtered using a 0.45 Î¼m filter. Nsp12 was

purified using Streptactin Agarose (IBA) eluting with 2 mM desthiobiotin. Eluted protein was further
purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex200 column (GE Life Sciences) in 25 mM

HEPES pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM magnesium chloride, and 2 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine.

Full-length, codon-optimized nsp7 and nsp8 genes were cloned into pET46 for expression in E. coli.
The N-terminal tags for SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 are MAHHHHHHVDDDDKMENLYFQG and for

EAV nsp7 is MAHHHHHHVGTENLYFQ. The TEV protease cleavage sites (ENLYFQ|G) were positioned
to leave N-terminal glycines on SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 and no additional amino acids on EAV

nsp7. Proteins were expressed in Rosetta2 pLysS E. coli (Novagen). Bacterial cultures were grown to
an OD600 of 0.8 at 37 Â°C, and then the expression was induced with a final concentration of 0.5 mM of

isopropylÎ²-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside and the growth temperature was reduced to16 Â°C for 14â16 h.
Cells were harvested by centrifugation and were resuspended in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 300 mM

sodium chloride, 30 mM imidazole, and 2 mM dithiothreitol. Resuspended cells were lysed using a
microfluidizer. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 25,000 Ã g for 30 min and then filtered
using a 0.45 Î¼m filter. Protein was purified using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) eluting with 300 mM

imidazole. Eluted proteins were digested with 1% (w/w) TEV protease. TEV protease-digested

proteins were passed over Ni-NTA agarose to remove uncleaved proteins and then further purified

by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex200 column (GE Life Sciences) in 25 mM HEPES
pH 7.4, 300 mM sodium chloride, 0.1 mM magnesium chloride, and 2 mM dithiothreitol.
Nucleotidylation assay
Nucleotidylation assays were performed similarly to as previously described 1. The EAV nsp9
or SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 RdRP proteins were incubated with a 2 â 4 molar excess of EAV nsp7 or
SARS-CoV-2 nsp7 and nsp8 proteins, respectively, in following buffer: 50 mM Tris pH 8.5, 6 mM
MnCl2, 1 mM DTT, 25 mM NaCl and 2% glycerol. Labeling reactions were initiated by the addition of
GTP and were incubated for 30 minutes at 30Â°C. Radioactivity assays employed 0.5 â 5 ÂµCi Î±-32PGTP (Perkin Elmer) with total GTP concentration of 0.17 ÂµM, whereas mass spectrometry assays
used 0.2 â 1 mM GTP, 15N-GTP (Sigma), or 13C-GTP (Sigma).

SDS-PAGE and autoradiography
Samples were mixed with 4x LDS loading dye (Thermo) containing 200 mM DTT and analyzed
on Bolt Bis-Tris Plus gels (Thermo) according to manufacturerâs instructions. Gels were either stained
with GelCodeTM Blue Protein Stain (Fisher Scientific) or prepared for autoradiography by incubation in
a 10% polyethyleneglycol 8000 (Sigma) solution for 30 minutes and gel drying at 70Â°C for 45 minutes
using a Hoefer gel drier, Savant condenser unit and an TRIVAC pump (Leybolt). Gels were exposed
to phosphor screens for 2 to 48 hours and developed with a Molecular Dynamics Storm 850 imager.
Gel images were examined using ImageJ opensource software.

Nucleotidylation reactions were brought to 6.7 M Urea in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 5
mM DTT and incubated at 42Â°C for 15 minutes. Cysteines were alkylated by the addition of 15 mM
iodoacetamide for 30 minutes at room temperature. Following the neutralization of unreacted
iodoacetamide with 15 mM DTT, nsp proteins were diluted to a final concentration if 1M urea and
digested overnight with either Trypsin/LysC mix, Chymotrypsin, or GluC (Promega) according to
manufacturerâs instructions. The resulting peptides were desalted using OMIX C18 pipette tips
(Agilent Technologies) or 1 mL C18 Sep Pak cartridges (Waters) in 10 mM ammonium formate at pH
7.0, eluted in 75% acetonitrile, and dried to completion with a vacuum centrifuge.
For LC-MS/MS analysis, each digested sample was suspended in 0.1% formic acid and
maintained at 7Â°C until analysis within 12 hours. Samples were loaded onto Thermo Scientific
Easyspray C4 or C18 nanocolumn and eluted with a gradient to 80% acetonitrile / 0.1% formic acid at
300 nL/min at room temperature using an Ultimate 3000 series liquid chromatography system. Eluted
peptides were ionized in-line with a Thermo Scientific Easy Spray source for direct analysis with a
Thermo Scientific Fusion Lumos Orbitrap mass spectrometer and subjected to a targeted or datadependent MS/MS acquisition scheme that collected both HCD and EThcD spectra in the high
resolution orbitrap.
LC-MS peaks were defined by analyzing the data with the feature mapping and precursor
quantification nodes in Proteome Discoverer 2.4 that determined the retention time, charge state, and
abundance of every peak in each searched file. The data were filtered and exported to Microsoft
Excel to search for peaks that 1) were not present in unlabeled samples and 2) that possessed two
peaks with the same charge state at a similar retention time (+/- 0.5 minute) and were mass-shifted
by 4.9852 or 10.0336 amu [MH+ ion masses] for 15N- or 13C-GMP labeling, respectively, within a +/1.5 ppm error limit (Extended Data Figure 4, Extended Data Figure 5). Supplementary Table 1,
Supplementary Table 2, and Supplementary Table 3 are the Microsoft Excel worksheets used to
perform these searches once the data was exported.

To identify peptide spectrum matches, data were searched with the Sequest HT algorithm
through Proteome Discoverer 2.4 and matched with a mass error tolerance of 0.04 Da for MS/MS
fragment ions 2. GMP adducts were assigned by allowing a dynamic modification for the mass
addition of 345.0474 (and 350.0326 or 355.0810 for 15N and 13C labeled GMP) to H, S, T, Y, K or R,
based on known phosphodiester or phosphoramide attachment chemistry 3-5, although all possible
sites were considered in initial, preliminary searches. For the SARS-CoV-2 GMP localization on nsp7,
initial searches assigned the modification site to the N-terminal glycine at peptide position 1, but the
modification site was manually determined to be located at ser-2 (ser-1 in natural nsp7) because of
the presence of the y13+ ion (ser-2) at an m/z of 1798.78857 that contained the GMP moiety. For each
unique peptide m/z, the top-scoring peptide spectrum matches for both EThcD and HCD are
presented in Supplementary Table 4 along with GMP-attachment site assignments and additional
information. The top-scoring, overall match for each peptide is presented in Table 1 along with the
corresponding attachment site assignment. All matches had a precursor mass error of +/- 1.5 ppm or
less and were validated with a target-decoy search using a cut-off false discover rate value of 1%.
Only peptides with a top spectrum match Xcorrelation score of 2.5 or greater were reported.
Extracted ion chromatograms and spectra were generated using Freestyle software (Thermo
Scientific). Note that for EAV reactions, not all GMP-modified candidate peaks were examined in MS2,
because all EAV data was acquired prior to data analysis and MS2 was performed in a datadependent acquisition scheme. Though a single site was found in SARS-CoV-2, additional
phosphoramidate linked GMP sites likely exist that may not have been observed because of the
lability of the GMP attachment in the acidic conditions used for LC-MS/MS (Extended Data Figure 1).

Supplementary Information Guide:
Supplementary Table 1: Data analysis of LC-MS peaks for a single SARS-CoV-2 chymotrypsindigested sample that contained peptides labeled with GMP, 15N-GMP and 13C-GMP. âSearch set upâ
tab shows formulas and criteria to search each LC-MS peak against all others (âindex to searchâ tab).
Two additional tabs show search results and filtered results.

Supplementary Table 2: Data analysis of LC-MS peaks for a single SARS-CoV-2 GluC-digested
sample that contained peptides labeled with GMP, 15N-GMP and 13C-GMP. âSearch set upâ tab
shows formulas and criteria to search each LC-MS peak against all others (âindex to searchâ tab).
Two additional tabs show search results and filtered results.

Supplementary Table 3: Data analysis of LC-MS peaks for EAV trypsin-digested samples that were
not labeled with GMP or were labeled with either GMP, 15N-GMP or 13C-GMP. Peaks unique to two
labeled, replicate injections (GMP-, 15N-GMP or 13C-GMP-labeled) were exported and searched
against all others (âindex to searchâ tab). Three tabs total.

Supplementary Table 4: Summary of all MS/MS peptide spectrum matches containing a GMP, 15NGMP, or 13C-GMP adduct. Top scoring hits for each peptide mass (m/z) and for each fragmentation
method (HCD or EThcD) are shown along with peptide sequence, Xcorrelation score, precursor mass
error, raw data file name, scan number, and other relevant information.
