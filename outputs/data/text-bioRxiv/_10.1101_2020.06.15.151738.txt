Summary
Positive strand, single strand RNA viruses ((+)ssRNA viruses) are viruses with an RNA genome
that have broad impacts on a wide range of hosts, including SARS-CoV-2 human respiratory
infections. Their replication and gene expression are driven by RNA dependent RNA
polymerases (RdRp). Detecting active RNA synthesis by RdRp is critical for assessing the
infectivity and pathogenicity of (+)ssRNA viruses. Current approaches rely on viral RNA
detection, which cannot distinguish viral titer from RdRp activity. Precision Run-On sequencing
(PRO-seq) is a nuclear run-on based nascent RNA sequencing method, widely used to map
eukaryotic RNA polymerases by using labeled nucleotide analogues. Here we provide evidence
that PRO-seq also detects RdRp activity and can serve as a highly sensitive RdRp mapping
method. Coupled to PRO-seq in human blood samples, we propose to use PRO-seq as a single
package method to detect (+)ssRNA virus RdRp activity and its interaction with host immune
response through transcriptome-wide profiling of leukocyte gene expressions at once.

Brief Communication
Positive strand, single strand RNA viruses ((+)ssRNA viruses) are viruses with an RNA genome
that have broad impacts on a wide range of hosts, including coronaviruses in human respiratory
infections​1,2​. Their replication and gene expression are driven by RNA dependent RNA
polymerases (RdRp)​3,4​. Detecting active RNA synthesis by RdRp is critical for assessing the
infectivity and pathogenicity of (+)ssRNA viruses. Current approaches rely on viral RNA
detection, which cannot distinguish viral titer from RdRp activity​5​. For example, immune cell
tropism of coronavirus is a factor related to the severity of the disease outcome currently under
debate​6,7​, and it will be critical to distinguish the simple presence of viruses in blood from active
viral expression inside blood cells.
PRO-seq is a nuclear run-on based nascent RNA sequencing method, widely used to map
eukaryotic RNA polymerases (RNAP) by using labeled nucleotide analogs​8,9​. Here we provide
evidence that PRO-seq can also detect RdRp activity, and propose that PRO-seq can serve as
a highly sensitive RdRp mapping method. Coupled to PRO-seq in human samples, we
anticipate the detection of RNA viruses and their activities through RdRp mapping. PRO-seq in
blood samples of (+)-strand ssRNA virus infected patients will further define if there is immune
cell tropism of the virus, and host-virus interactions: if the virus interferes with expression levels
of the host factors, and if host immune gene expression affects the severity of the infection.
Drosophila A virus (DAV) is a (+)-strand ssRNA virus with low pathogenicity, infecting up to 30%
of natural Drosophila populations​10​. We previously found that it is also transmitted in
experimental Drosophila cell lines such as Snyder-2 (S2) cells. DAV is among the picornavirus
family that encodes RdRp as the replicating and transcribing RNA polymerase​11​. Drosophila S2
cells were among the first cells to which PRO-seq methods were implemented to map RNAP in
high resolution​8​. We reanalyzed the PRO-seq data in S2 cells, and investigated whether any of
the PRO-seq reads were derived from non-Drosophila sequences. In the PRO-seq data with all
4 biotin-NTPs supplied in the Run-On reaction, 9.21 million reads were sequenced, 7.22 million
reads (78%) were aligned at least once to the Drosophila melanogaster genome (Dm6), and
1.99 million reads were not mapped to the Dm6 genome. We re-aligned these unmapped reads
to the collection of NCBI all virus sequences (12,442 virus refseq sequences), and 39,624 reads
mapped to at least once virus sequence (2.0% of unmapped reads). 31,417 of those reads
mapped to the DAV genome (NC_012958; 79% of viral sequences), indicating that PRO-seq
reads from viral origin in S2 cells are predominantly from DAV. The PRO-seq reads from DAV
covered the entire span of the DAV genome mostly on the plus strand (​Figure 1A​).
While PRO-seq is highly specific for nascent, biotin-labeled RNAs, it is also possible that DAV
PRO-seq reads may have derived from the mature DAV RNA genome that contaminated the
sample in small frequencies. The referenced PRO-seq study is originally designed to rule out
this possibility by including Run-On libraries with one type of biotin-NTP supplied at once
without the presence of any other NTP substrates. For example, PRO-seq biotin-CTP library is
produced after washing out other NTP pools and supplying only the biotin-CTP in the Run-On

reaction. This allows only the incorporation of biotin-CTP at the active site of the RNA
polymerases if the RNA polymerase is positioned at the C base, because no other NTP
substrates are available for the Run-On reaction. Therefore, 3′ ends of the PRO-seq RNA reads
should predominantly be the C base (​Figure 1B​). In the original analysis, up to 90% of all reads
ended with the supplied biotin-NTP base (A), supporting that PRO-seq detects nascent RNA
transcribed by RNA polymerase. We performed the last base composition analysis on the
PRO-seq reads aligned to the DAV genome (​Figure 1C​). Overall, 65-70% of the PRO-seq
reads mapped to the DAV genome ended with the same base as the run-on base. If the reads
were derived from RNA molecules in viral particles, the base composition would have been the
same as the DAV genome composition (A:C:G:U = 29:24:24:24), which is not observed. This
indicates that RdRp can incorporate biotin-NTPs similarly to nuclear run-ons, and the majority of
PRO-seq reads from the DAV genome are the products of RdRp activity.
While all 4 single base run-ons show expected last base frequencies, the absolute amount of
reads mapped to the DAV genome differs between each single base run-on (​Table 1​, ​Figure
1A​). Biotin-CTP and biotin-UTP PRO-seq libraries show up to 10 times more reads mapped to
the DAV genome than biotin-ATP and biotin-GTP libraries. This suggests that RdRp may be
less efficient in using biotin-purine NTPs, and that biotin-pyrimidine NTPs (biotin-CTP and
biotin-UTP) are the preferred substrates. This is different from Drosophila RNA Polymerase II,
which appears to have comparable substrate specificity for all 4 biotin-NTPs.
The PRO-seq reads cover the entire DAV genome, but some regions show increased PRO-seq
densities suggestive of RdRp stalling or pausing. For example, there are increased read
densities 100-200 bases downstream of the open reading frame (ORF) of RdRp (positions
200-300) and capsid protein of DAV (positions 3,500-3,700), reminiscent of promoter proximal
pausing in eukaryotes. There are also read accumulations near the end of the ORFs (positions
4,500-4,600).
The ORF-proximal accumulation coincides with quadruplet rich regions of the template-strand of
the DAV genome (​Figure 1D​). For example, C-quadruplets are more frequent in ORF-proximal
PRO-seq peaks at 200-300 base regions (​Figure 1E​). This suggests the complementary
G-quadruplets on the template strand are associated with RdRp stalling. G-quadruplets are
known to form stable secondary RNA structures, and may provide physical barriers to RdRp
elongation. Therefore, sequence features of the DAV genome can play a critical role in RdRp
processivity, and these RNA sequence features can become therapeutic targets for clinical
ssRNA virus infections.
We then examined if PRO-seq can be used to detect RdRp activity in human samples. We
previously developed a PRO-seq procedure for a small amount of peripheral whole blood, which
will detect the transcriptional landscape of nucleated leukocytes. This procedure uses
biotin-CTP in the presence of 4 other NTPs as the substrates, and should be compatible with
RdRp. One of the hypotheses on ssRNA virus infections is that they may drive immune cell
response to aggravate symptoms of infection, possibly by directly infecting the immune cells.

For example, a recent study suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect T cells and induce
T cell exhaustion​6​. PRO-seq in peripheral blood cells can not only test such hypotheses on viral
activity by detecting RdRp, but also can provide comprehensive profiles of gene expression and
transcriptional enhancer activities at the same time. This will allow us to examine host-ssRNA
virus interactions with quantitative measures.
We analyzed 13 peripheral blood Chromatin Run-On (pChRO-seq) datasets, a modified version
of PRO-seq, using 0.5 - 1.0 ml blood samples from 10 de-identified individuals, whose
conditions regarding any viral infection were unknown. We collected PRO-seq reads that did not
map to the Hg38 genome, and aligned them to the NCBI all virus database as described above.
From this data, we did not detect significant PRO-seq sequences from (+)ssRNA viral genomes,
indicating that none of the individuals had direct viral infections in the blood immune cells. For
example, unlike the S2 cell data, we did not find any sequences specific to Drosophila A virus
genome. This can serve as a baseline for evaluating human samples with active (+)ssRNA virus
infections.
Viral infections lead to a diverse range of severity in clinical symptoms, and gene expression in
immune cells such as cytokine response is an important factor in host-virus interaction. Our
PRO-seq data show expression levels of immune-response related genes from human
peripheral blood leukocytes. Out of 3,299 “immune” related genes classified by Gene Ontology,
we found 990 differentially expressed genes in at least 1 individual (false discovery rate < 0.05,
DESeq). Typically, PRO-seq levels are two or more fold higher in one or more individuals in
these differentially expressed genes (​Figure 2A​). These expression patterns form clusters of
immune related genes and clusters of individuals (​Figure 2B)​. The co-clustering of biologically
replicated data from one individual (P1, P1n, P1nh) shows the reproducibility of PRO-seq in
peripheral leukocytes (pChRO). The gene expression patterns suggest that individuals can be
classified into groups with different immunity patterns if PRO-seq in peripheral leukocytes were
conducted on a larger scale.
Overall, PRO-seq can serve as an extremely efficient method to both map RdRp activity and
evaluate host immunity at once in human samples. The transcription/replication landscape of
the (+)ssRNA viruses, as we report in DAV by PRO-seq, will provide a mechanistic basis of
initiation and elongation by RdRp that can be directly applied to viruses that infect humans, such
as SARS-CoV-2. RdRp is the direct target of the only approved drug for SARS-CoV-2 infection,
Remdesivir, a chain terminating nucleoside analogue of RdRp. Identifying RdRp initiation and
pausing sites in addition to defining sequence elements that regulate RdRp initiation and
elongation can play a critical role in developing SARS-CoV-2 and other (+)ssRNA virus
therapeutics.
Transcription/replication of the DAV genome by RdRp is not completely uniform throughout the
whole genome, and there appear to be sites of RdRp slowdown, pausing, premature
termination, and internal re-initiation. PRO-seq and 5′ end cap analysis of PRO-seq (PRO-cap)
can precisely define these sites and sequence elements on the viral genome. Antisense RNA

that interferes with these elements would be a straightforward therapeutic option that can
synergize with nucleoside analog inhibitors such as Remdesivir. In addition, host factors that
contribute to post-translational modification of eukaryotic transcription, replication, or RNA
processing machinery can also play a role in RdRp processivity on the viral genome. Testing
known small molecules using PRO-seq on a human cell based system, and directly measuring
specific stages of RdRp initiation and elongation, will provide detailed information to identify
drug candidates to be used in combination with other RdRp inhibitors. For example, secondary
structures of the RNA genome may cause RdRp stalling as we observed in DAV, and drugs
stabilizing RNA structures or inhibiting RNA helicases may also inhibit RdRp elongation. Such
synergisms targeting RdRp from multiple mechanistic aspects will increase the efficiency of
existing drugs such as Remdesivir and allow the use of lower tolerable doses in combinatorial
therapies.
Finally, PRO-seq can provide measures of the expression levels of host factors while also
measuring viral activity. While many (+)ssRNA viruses manifest as respiratory tract infections,
there has been strong suspicion that severe cases may affect immune cells, either directly or
indirectly. The versatility of PRO-seq to use blood leukocytes from untreated whole blood
samples provides us with an opportunity to inspect the presence of actively infecting viruses in
immune cells, and immune gene expression profiles that interact with viral infections at
systematic levels at the same time. PRO-seq has the advantage of distinguishing inactive viral
nucleic acids from actively transcribing and replicating viral genomes. Therefore, we propose to
repurpose PRO-seq as an efficient strategy to map RdRp activities along with host gene
expression profile to evaluate host-virus interactions simultaneously with high genomic
resolution.

Methods
Identifying Drosophila A Virus (DAV) transcription from PRO-seq data
Drosophila PRO-seq sample sequences from a dataset included in Kwak et al, 2013 Science
was retrieved from NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under the accession GSE42117.
The samples are located in the Sequence Read Archive SRX203291. The four runs
(SRR611824, SRR611825, SRR611826, SRR611827) were downloaded, adaptor sequences
were removed using cutadapt, and the trimmed sequences were mapped to the reference
Drosophila genome sequence (dm6) using STAR aligner. We aligned unmapped reads to the
DAV sequence retrieved from the NCBI virus repository using the bwa bwa aligned.
Human peripheral blood cell PRO-seq and analysis
Peripheral blood cell PRO-seq was performed as described previously​12​. Briefly, frozen blood
sample is thawed and lysed in NUN buffer (0.3M NaCl, 1M Urea, 1% NP-40, 20mM HEPES, pH
7.5, 7.5mM MgCl2, 0.2mM EDTA, 1x protease inhibitor cocktail, 1 mM DTT, 4 u/ml RNase
inhibitor) and chromatin is pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 20 min, 4°C. Pelleted
chromatin was washed and used for the ultrashort PRO-seq procedure (uPRO). ​Chromatin or
cells were incubated in the nuclear run-on reaction condition with biotin-NTPs and rNTPs supplied
for 5 min at 37°C. Run-On RNA was extracted using TRIzol, and fragmented. 3′ RNA adaptors are
ligated followed by 2 consecutive streptavidin bead bindings and extractions. Extracted RNA is
converted to cDNA using template switch reverse transcription. After a SPRI bead clean-up, the
cDNA is PCR amplified using primers compatible with Illumina Small RNA sequencing. Downstream
analyses were performed as described previously​12​.

genome. Both the plus (red) and minus (blue) strand reads are normalized to the same
sequencing depths in all PRO-seq 5 libraries. Biotin labeled NTPs are listed along the left side
of the figure, and position in bases is shown across the top of the figure. Red bars on the
shaded top panel reflect ORFs for the RdRp and the Capsid proteins. Note that the PRO-seq
reads from DAV cover the DAV genome on the positive strand almost entirely. ​B.​ Schematics of
single-NTP PRO-seq (example of CTP). This image describes the process of labeling and
sequencing biotin-labeled RNA transcripts, using CTP as an example. This process was
repeated with ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP. The first graphic (left) shows how in isolated nuclei,
nascent RNAs are transcribed by the polymerase. The second graphic (middle) shows how
biotin-CTP is introduced and incorporated into the nascent RNA to create biotin-labeled nascent
RNA at which point transcription ends. The third graphic (right) shows how biotin-labeled RNA
transcripts are sequenced from the 3’ end. ​C.​ Base frequency of DAV mapped reads in
single-NTP PRO-seq libraries. The last base frequency is indicated along the left side of the
figure, and the specific biotin labeled NTP is indicated along the bottom of the figure. The green
portions indicate A as the last base, blue portions indicate C as the last base, yellow portions
indicate G as the last base, red portions indicate U as the last base, and gray portions indicate
N as the last base. In each case, approximately 65-70% of the PRO-seq reads that were
mapped to the DAV genome ended with the same base as the run-on base. This indicates that
most of the PRO-seq reads originating from the DAV genome are a result of RdRp activity.
However, absolute mapped read numbers are higher in biotin-CTP and biotin-UTP libraries. ​D.
PRO-seq density on DAV genome and base-quadruplet counts.The read count is indicated
along the left side of each graph. The read densities for the PRO-seq data are much higher
(some in the thousands) than the quadruplet read densities (less than ten). The first graph
contains PRO-seq density data in red. The second graph shows A-quadruplet density data in
green. The third graph shows C-quadruplet density data in blue. The position in bases is
indicated along the bottom of each graph. Regions that show increased densities of PRO-seq
are indicative of RdRp pausing. This can be seen at positions 200-300, 3,500-3,700, and
4,500-4,600. ​E.​ Enrichment analysis of template strand G-quadruplets on high PRO-seq density
regions. G-quadruplets on the template strand are associated with RdRp stalling because
C-quadruplets are more frequent in ORF-proximal PRO-seq peaks at the 200-300 base regions.
The left side of each graph indicates read density. The bottom of the figure indicates the rank of
each position by read density. In the bottom graph, G-quadruplet positions are mapped. Density
score is 0.0 in the red region, -1.0 in the yellow region, and -2.0 in the blue region, as indicated
by the key on the right-hand side. The enrichment score is graphed in the top graph in green,
with a p-value of 0.021 indicating a significant difference in densities.
