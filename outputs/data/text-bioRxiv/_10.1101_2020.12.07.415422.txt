ABSTRACT

2
3

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) encoded by DNA genomes have been identified across host and

4

pathogen species as parts of the transcriptome. Accumulating evidences indicate that circRNAs

5

play critical roles in autoimmune diseases and viral pathogenesis. Here we report that RNA viruses

6

of the Betacoronavirus genus of Coronaviridae, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV,

7

encode a novel type of circRNAs. Through de novo circRNA analyses of publicly available

8

coronavirus-infection related deep RNA-Sequencing data, we identified 351, 224 and 2,764

9

circRNAs derived from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and

10

characterized two major back-splice events shared by these viruses. Coronavirus-derived

11

circRNAs are more abundant and longer compared to host genome-derived circRNAs. Using a

12

systematic strategy to amplify and identify back-splice junction sequences, we experimentally

13

identified over 100 viral circRNAs from SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero E6 cells. This collection of

14

circRNAs provided the first line of evidence for the abundance and diversity of coronavirus-

15

derived circRNAs and suggested possible mechanisms driving circRNA biogenesis from RNA

16

genomes. Our findings highlight circRNAs as an important component of the coronavirus

17

transcriptome.

18
19

Summary: We report for the first time that abundant and diverse circRNAs are generated by

20

SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and represent a novel type of circRNAs that differ

21

from circRNAs encoded by DNA genomes.

INTRODUCTION

25

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a single strand and positive

26

sense RNA virus and belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus of the family of Coronaviridae (CoVs).

27

It is responsible for the ongoing global pandemic of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 shares ~80%

28

homology with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and is more closely

29

related with Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) than other four

30

commonly circulated human coronaviruses (1, 2). SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV,

31

emerged within last two decades and have posed major challenges to global health. However, we

32

still have very limited understanding of their pathogenicity factors. The transcriptional regulation

33

of CoV gene expression is complex due to the large size of the genome (~30kb). The first open

34

reading frame (ORF), ORF1a/1b, is translated from the positive-strand genomic RNA (gRNA) as

35

a polyprotein, which is cleaved proteolytically into non-structural proteins. ORFs located towards

36

the 3’ side of the genome encode conserved structural proteins, including S (spike protein), E

37

(envelope protein), M (membrane protein) and N (nucleocapsid protein), and accessory proteins.

38

These proteins are translated from a set of sub-genomic RNAs (sgRNA) generated through TRS-

39

L and TRS-B (transcription-regulating sequences from the leader and body) mediated

40

discontinuous RNA synthesis (3). It is recently revealed that the transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 is

41

even more complex with numerous non-canonical discontinuous transcripts produced and

42

potentially encoding unknown ORFs through fusion, deletion, truncation and/or frameshift of

43

existing ORFs (4). It is unclear if additional components exist in the transcriptome of SARS-CoV-

44

2 and other CoVs.

45

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of single-stranded noncoding RNA species with a

46

covalent closed circular configuration. CircRNAs are formed either through back-splicing of exons

3

47

or from intron lariat by escaping debranching (5). CircRNAs are resistant to exonuclease-mediated

48

degradation and are more stable than linear RNA (6). They may encode proteins (7) or function as

49

miRNA and protein sponges (8). Recent studies have revealed circRNAs as important pathological

50

biomarkers for cancers (9), neurological diseases (10) and autoimmune diseases (11). Furthermore,

51

viral-derived circRNAs have been identified from several DNA viruses, including Epstein-Barr

52

Virus (12-14), Kaposi Sarcoma Virus (15-17) and human papillomaviruses (18), and are

53

implicated with a role in pathogenesis (18).

54

In this study, we report the bioinformatical identification and characterization of SARS-

55

CoV-2-, SARS-CoV- and MERS-CoV-derived circRNAs as a novel type of circRNAs using

56

publicly available deep RNA-Seq data. We also present the first systematic approach to validation

57

circRNAs expressed by SARS-CoV-2. We experimentally identified over 100 circRNAs, which

58

supports the major findings from our bioinformatic analyses. Our results demonstrate the

59

abundance and diversity of circRNAs derived from RNA viral genomes of beta-coronaviruses,

60

providing insights into the biogenesis and functions of circRNAs during viral infection.

RESULTS

63

Identification of SARS-CoV-2-, SARS-CoV- and MERS-CoV-derived circRNAs and

64

characterization of back-splice junction hotspots using CIRI2

65

It is recommended that bioinformatic analyses of circRNAs are performed on datasets with at least

66

30 million 100-bp raw reads generated from cDNA libraries prepared from rRNA-depleted total

67

RNA (19). To look for circRNAs derived from CoV genomes, we identified SARS-CoV-2-,

68

SARS-CoV- and MERS-CoV-infection-related deep RNA-Seq datasets in the NCBI Gene

69

Expression Omnibus database. Considering the replication kinetics and tropism of CoVs (20), we

70

chose datasets from GSE153940 (21), GSE56193, and GSE139516 (22), with 24 hours post

71

infection (hpi) as the timepoint, Vero E6 (African green monkey kidney) cells as the host for

72

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and Calu-3 (human lung adenocarcinoma) cells as the host for

73

MERS-CoV. A circRNA enrichment step was included during cDNA preparation for the MERS-

74

CoV datasets (22), rendering the MERS-CoV datasets more sensitive for circRNA detection.

75

CoVs use an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) to generate genomic RNA and

76

sgRNA transcripts in the cytoplasm of host cells. We thus reasoned that CoV circRNAs, if existed,

77

are likely to circularize independent of splicing, which occurs in the nucleus. Several circRNA

78

prediction algorithms have been developed to identify BSJ reads from RNA-Seq data and to

79

predict the 5’ and 3’ breakpoints (23). CIRI2 (23) is the only tool that adopts an MLE-based

80

algorithm to unbiasedly identify back-splice junction (BSJ) reads independent of a circRNA

81

reference annotation file. It is more sensitive and accurate than two other de novo circRNA

82

identification tools (23). Therefore, we used the recommended CIRI2 pipeline (24) to perform de

83

novo circRNA discovery and assembly.

84

To improve the assembly accuracy and to simplify follow-up comparison, we combined

85

reads of biological triplicates into single datasets. After mapping with BWA-MEM (25), we

86

obtained 1,216,403,242 total reads from the SARS-CoV-2 dataset with 36.6% mapped to SARS-

87

CoV-2. The MERS-CoV dataset had a similar percentage (30.2% of 316,893,928 total reads)

88

mapped to the viral genome. And 87.0% of the 1,127,121,362 total reads from the SARS-CoV

89

dataset was mapped to SARS-CoV. The SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV datasets showed sharp

90

peaks at the 5’ leader sequence and high coverage towards the 3’ end of the genome (Figure 1A

91

and 1B). Genome coverage of the MERS-CoV dataset was substantially lower due to the removal

92

of linear RNAs by RNase R (Figure1A and 1B). We observed above-threshold coverage in the last

93

5,000 nucleotides (nt) of the MERS-CoV genome, corresponding to E, N, ORF8b and the 3’UTR.

94

CIRI2 identifies circRNAs by aligning chimeric reads to the 3’ donor sequence and the 5’

95

acceptor sequence and determining the exact breakpoints of the BSJ (Figure 1C). By this definition,

96

we identified 351 SARS-CoV-2 circRNAs, 224 SARS-CoV circRNAs and 2,764 MERS-CoV

97

circRNAs. The larger number of circRNAs identified from MERS-CoV genome compared to

98

SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV demonstrates the efficiency of circRNA enrichment with RNase R

99

digestion. While the majority of CoV-derived circRNAs had very low (<10) BSJ-spanning reads,

100

14 SARS-CoV-2 circRNAs (4%), 3 SARS-CoV circRNAs (1%) and 68 MERS-CoV circRNAs

101

(2%) had over 1,000 BSJ-spanning reads (Figure 1D-1F and S1F). An additional 3-6% of the

102

identified circRNAs had 300-1,000 BSJ-spanning reads (Figure 1D-1F). In fact, the most abundant

103

circRNA identified in each CoV dataset had >10,000 BSJ-spanning reads (SARS-CoV-

104

2_29122|29262: 10,763; SARS-CoV_28136|28606: 13,690; MERS-CoV_1503|29952: 29,467).

105

While more circRNAs were identified from the host genomes (monkey: 10,291; human: 43357),

106

the overall expression level of host circRNAs is much lower compared to CoV circRNAs (Figure

107

S1F).

108

To examine the circRNA landscape, we mapped all identified circRNAs by the 5’ and 3’

109

breakpoints of the BSJs to their respective genomic locations and estimated the back-splicing

110

frequency by counting the reads spanning the BSJs (Figure 1D-1F). We identified two major types

111

of back-splicing events shared by all three CoVs: 1) long-distance back-splicing between the 3’

112

end of the genome and the 5’ end of the genomes; 2) local back-splicing in regions corresponding

113

to the N gene of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and the 3’UTR of MERS-CoV). We also noticed

114

back-splicing events that specifically occur in SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV. Local back-splicing

115

around position 1500-2500 (Nsp2), 5500-6500nt (Nsp3) and 22000-23000nt (S) of the MERS-

116

CoV genome occurred at high frequency (Figure 1F), whereas middle-distance back-splicing from

117

SARS-CoV-2 genomic region 7501-8000 (Nsp3) to 1-500 (5’UTR) and from 27501-28000

118

(ORF7a/ORF7b) to 22001-22500nt (S) was observed at high frequency (Figure 1D).

119

Next, we performed de novo reconstruction and quantification of full-length SARS-CoV-

120

2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV circRNAs using the CIRI-full (24) algorithm. We got 300

121

reconstructed SARS-CoV-2 circRNAs, of which 127 (42.3%) were full-length. Of 201 assembled

122

SARS-CoV circRNAs, 122 (60.7%) were full-length. We also got 1,024 reconstructed MERS-

123

CoV circRNAs, with 81.6% were fully assembled, suggesting that RNase R treatment improves

124

circRNA reconstruction. De novo assembly of host circRNAs resulted in 4,815 (49.9%) full-length

125

monkey circRNAs and 31,808 (100%) full-length human circRNAs.

126

Furthermore, we compared the features of circRNAs derived from CoVs with those from

127

the host genomes. The length of nuclear genome-derived circRNAs (nu-circRNAs) is highly

128

conserved across species with the majority ranging from 250 to 500 nt (24). We observed similar

129

length distribution in full-length monkey and human genome-derived circRNAs (Figure 2A). CoV

130

circRNAs shared a different length distribution pattern (Figure 2B). The average length of SARS-

131

CoV-2 and MERS-CoV circRNAs was over 150 nt longer than that of the host circRNAs (Figure

132

2A and 2B). And more SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV circRNAs were over 1,000 nt long whereas

133

host circRNAs are rarely over 750 nt in length. Since CoV have both positive and negative

134

genomic and subgenomic RNAs, we examined the strandness of CoV circRNAs. CircRNAs

135

generated by both host genomes showed no strand preference (Vero: 51.9% positive-stranded;

136

Calu-3: 51.0% positive-stranded). In contrast, 59.5% of SARS-CoV-2 circRNAs, 56.3% of SARS-

7

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.07.415422; this version posted December 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

137

CoV circRNAs, and 85.1% of MERS-CoV circRNAs were negative-stranded (Figure 2A). This

138

result suggests that CoV circRNAs have a preference for negative strand.

139

Nu-circRNAs with the same BSJ often have a diverse number of forward-splicing junctions

140

(FSJs) and circRNA exons due to alternative intron retention (24). sgRNA with canonical and non-

141

canonical FSJs have been observed in CoVs (3, 4), suggesting that CoV circRNAs may also have

142

FSJs and circRNA isoforms. We examined the number of FSJs in full-length host and CoV

143

circRNAs. While circRNA without FSJ only represent 6% of host circRNAs, the majority of CoV

144

circRNAs had no FSJ (SARS-CoV-2: 64.6%; SARS-CoV: 82%; MERS-CoV: 83.3%).

145

Additionally, only 1 FSJ could be detected in predicted full-length CoV circRNAs, whereas about

146

50% of host circRNAs had at least 2 FSJs (Figure 2D). Next, we looked for predicted full-length

147

CoV circRNAs that share the same BSJ breakpoints but differ in length. We found that MERS-

148

CoV circRNA 1262|29148 produces two isoforms, both of which contain one FSJ. The longer

149

isoform (1,051nt) has the FSJ 2223|29060, whereas the shorter isoform (155nt) has the FSJ

150

1316|29049. This result shows that very few CoV circRNAs could have isoforms.

151

In conclusion, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV related deep RNA-

152

Seq datasets, and identified a large amount of CoV circRNAs. The circRNAs of CoV origin have

153

features in common and can be distinguished from circRNAs derived from the human and monkey

154

host genomes. We have shown that CoV circRNAs are expressed at higher level and longer in

155

length than host circRNAs and tends to be negative stranded. We identified BSJ hotspots for

156

circRNAs derived from each CoV, and found that distant back-splicing from the tail of the genome

157

to the head of the genome and local back-splicing in regions corresponding to the N gene and the

158

3’UTR occur at the highest frequency.

160

Experimental detection and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 circRNAs

161

We extracted total RNA from Vero E6 cells mock-treated or infected with SARS-CoV-2 at 24 hpi.

162

Forward and reverse divergent primers were designed to maximize the chances of amplifying BSJ

163

sequences (Figure 3A and 3B). To validate the two major back-splicing events, we performed

164

inverse RT-PCR with primer pairs that targeting either the distant BSJ hotspot 29001-29903|1~500

165

or the local BSJ hotspots 28501~29500|27501~28500 (Figure S2A-S2C). We also performed

166

inverse RT-PCR with divergent primer sets targeting the most abundant SARS-CoV-2 circRNAs

167

predicted by CIRI2 (Figure 3C). Majority of the inverse RT-PCR reactions using the infected

168

sample as template resulted in products ranging from 200bp to 800bp, whereas no amplification

169

was seen from the mock samples. Notably, many candidate inverse RT-PCR products were more

170

abundant than that of circHIPK3, a known highly expressed human circRNA that served as a

171

positive control (Figure 3C, S2A and S2B). We gel-purified candidate PCR products based on the

172

size, subcloned by TA cloning, and Sanger-sequenced at least 8 colonies for each candidate BSJ

173

sequence. The sequencing results revealed the surprising diversity of SARS-CoV-2 circRNAs and

174

support our predictions from the bioinformatic analyses. First, all gel-purified bands represent

175

more than one PCR product of the same size. While highly expressed circRNAs, such as

176

29194|27797 and 28853|28467, represent over 50% of the confirmed clones (29194|27797: 5/7

177

with 29083-F and 27893-R; 28853|28467: 4/8 with 28809-F and 28494-R; Figure 3D and 3F),

178

most other purified bands contain a variety of circRNAs (data not shown). Secondly, we confirmed

179

that the breakpoints of a given circRNA is surprisingly flexible. For example, PCR products

180

amplified by 29668-F/29572-F and 51-R contain a distant BSJ. However, the 3’ breakpoint ranges

181

from genomic location 29,080nt to 29,767nt, and the 5’ breakpoint was between genomic location

182

7nt and 19nt (Figure S3B). When a deviation of 10nt was considered for the breakpoints, the

9

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.07.415422; this version posted December 8, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

183

predicted BSJ 29758|8 represent 8 out of the 13 BSJs confirmed by sequencing. Thirdly, both the

184

distant and the local back-splicing events were validated by multiple BSJs. We detected distant

185

fusion from ORF6, N, ORF10 and the 3’UTR to the 5’ UTR (data not shown). We also detected

186

local fusion within N, and from N to ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF8 (data not shown). In summary,

187

our RT-PCR and sequencing results validated the diversity of SARS2 circRNAs at the genome

188

level and at the circRNA level.

189

While the inverse RT-PCR was designed to amplify sequences around the BSJs, we

190

successfully assembled the full-length sequence of circRNA 29122|28295, of 828nt in length,

191

using a combination of primer sets (29045-F/28443-R, 28486-F/28341-R, 28809-F/28494-R and

192

28642-F/28553-R). The successful detection of circRNA 29122|28295 with multiple primer pairs

193

(Figure 3C, 3E, 3G and 3F) and the high rate of detection in subclones (data not shown) indicate

194

the overwhelming abundance of this circRNA. In fact, this circRNA corresponds to the most

195

abundant SARS-CoV-2 circRNA 29122|29262 predicted by CIRI2. This result demonstrates the

196

accuracy of our bioinformatic analysis.

197

To better understand the consistency of SARS-CoV-2 circRNA expression, we probed

198

SARS-CoV_29122|28295 in biological replicates of uninfected and infected samples at 8hpi and

199

24hpi with two divergent primer sets. RT-PCR with a convergent primer pair targeting the N gene

200

confirmed that the viral titer was comparable among the infected samples (Figure S3A). We found

201

that the bands (red arrowheads) corresponding to circRNA 29122|28295 were strong in all the

202

samples except for infected-24hpi-rep2, which is still detectable but significantly lower (Figure

203

3I). Interestingly, we found that the abundance of others candidate BSJ products (green arrows)

204

amplified by these primer sets was different between 8hpi and 24hpi samples. This result suggests

205

that circRNA expression level and pattern could change over the course of infection.

206

We also confirmed a few features of CoV circRNAs characterized bioinformatically. First,

207

we detected a variety of FSJs in SARS-CoV-2 circRNAs. The major type of FSJ was accompanied

208

with a long-distance back-splicing to the 5’UTR to create sgRNA-like circRNAs. We found 5

209

circRNAs that contained FSJ 75|28266 and 4 circRNAs that contained FSJ 76|26480 (data not

210

shown), suggesting TRS-mediated fusion of the leader sequence with N and M gene, respectively.

211

Interestingly, the BSJs in sgRNA-like circRNAs were more flexible. The 3’ breakpoints ranges

212

from 28465 to 2927, and the 5’ breakpoint ranges from 3 to 40 (Figure S3B). It is likely that these

213

circRNAs used sgRNAs as template for synthesis. We also detected FSJs that represent

214

noncanonical “splicing” events. 6066|29068 and 15466|28579 are long-range TRS-L-independent

215

distant fusion, whereas 28353|28408, 28353|28471, and 28666|28729 represent noncanonical local

216

fusions in the N genes, all of which are consistent with recent finding of noncanonical fusion in

217

the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome (4). Secondly, we confirmed alternative back-splicing events in

218

SARS-CoV2 circRNAs either with shared 5’ breakpoints or shared 3’ breakpoints. Distant back-

219

splicing from various loci in the N gene share the same 5’ breakpoints in the 5’UTR, such as

220

28465|40 and 29273|40. Fusion from the 3’ end of the M gene (genomic location 27282nt) to either

221

the TRS-L (47nt) or TRS-B (26484,) was observed.

222

Two circRNAs with unexpected repetitive back-splicing caught our attention. One had two

223

different distant back-splicing events (28465|40 and 28526|1) followed by the same TRS-L

224

dependent fusion, 75|28266 (Figure S3C). The other had two rounds of fusion from 28465 to 28320

225

followed by a third fusion from 28467 to 28282 (Figure S3D). Since the BSJs within the same

226

circRNAs were slightly different, it is unlikely to be an artifact of the rolling-cycle amplification

227

of circRNAs by RT. These two cases suggest that SARS-CoV-2 circRNAs form BSJs independent

228

of splicing. It is likely that SARS-CoV-2 circRNA are generated through the template-switching

229

mechanism that drives the formation of discontinuous transcripts. In support of this hypothesis,

230

we found that the upstream sequences of the acceptors were homologous to the donor sequence

231

(Figure 3D-H, data not shown). TRS-dependent FSJs in SARS-CoV-2 circRNAs had 11-12

232

homologous nucleotides between the leader and the body sequence. Also, BSJs with 3-6

233

nucleotides homology around the breakpoint was frequently observed.

234
235

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 produces a surprising diversity of
circRNAs that are abundantly present in the infected Vero E6 cells.

DISCUSSION

238

CircRNAs are a recently discovered and recognized type of RNA with important roles in

239

diseases. While some studies have been conducted in the context of viral infection, the focus was

240

on how host circRNAs respond to infection. So far, only limited viral circRNAs have been

241

identified from viruses, mostly from large DNA viruses of the family of herpesviridae, and the

242

circular RNA genome of the hepatitis delta virus is the only known closed circRNAs produced

243

by an RNA virus (26). Here we provide the first line of evidence that RNA genomes of beta-

244

coronaviruses encode a novel type of circRNAs, which differ from those encoded by DNA

245

genomes. In this study, we took two approaches: 1) bioinformatically profiling of the circRNA

246

landscape in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as their human and African

247

green monkey hosts by de novo circRNA identification and assembly of public available deep

248

RNA-Seq datasets using CIRI2; 2) experimentally profiling of the circRNA landscape in SARS-

249

CoV-2 by systematic capturing and identifying viral circRNAs produced from the predicted BSJ

250

hotspots.

251

We bioinformatically identified 351, 224 and 2,764 circRNAs derived from SARS-CoV-

252

2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively (Figure 1D-1F), and experimentally identified more

253

than 100 SARS-CoV-2 circRNAs (data not shown). Comparing the BSJ landscapes and

254

frequency among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV revealed two major circularization

255

events shared by all the three CoVs: 1) distant fusion between RNA located at the tail and the

256

head of the genome; 2) local fusion in the conserved N gene (Figure 1D-1F). These events were

257

confirmed by experimentally identified circRNAs (Figure 3C-H and S3B). What distinguishes

258

CoV circRNAs from host circRNAs are the expression level (Figure S1F), the length (Figure 2A

259

and 2B), the strand preference (Figure 2C), and the circRNA exon number (Figure 2D).

260

The collection of experimentally identified SARS-CoV-2 circRNAs further distinguishes

261

CoV circRNAs from Nu-circRNAs. First, we observed striking flexibility in the breakpoints of

262

SARS-CoV-2 circRNAs. Analysis of sequences around the 3’ and 5’ breakpoints of

263

experimentally identified SARS-CoV circRNAs suggest that homology-mediated inaccurate

264

fusion drives the back-splicing event (data not shown), whereas nu-circRNAs tend to splice

265

accurately on the AGGT splicing signal. Secondly, we found two cases where multiple back-

266

splicing events occurred in the same circRNAs (Figure S3C and S3D), suggesting back-splicing

267

occurs as the RNA is synthesized. It further suggests that the RNA configuration could create

268

BSJ hotspots that enable repetitive back-splicing.

269

As we wrote this manuscript, another group reported the first bioinformatic identification

270

of circRNAs in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (27). Interestingly, they came to

271

several opposing conclusions about CoV circRNAs, including the abundance, the strandness and

272

the expression level. It is likely due to the datasets they used and the circRNA analysis pipeline

273

and strategy they adopted. First, we chose SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV datasets with higher

13

274

sequencing depth and pooled biological triplicates before the analysis. As a result, we identified

275

240 circRNAs shared by CIRI2 and finc_circ (Figure S1E), twice the number they found. Since

276

CoV circRNA does not form BSJs through splicing, AG|GT signal-base algorithms are likely to

277

have an extreme high false discovery rate, which could lead to their opposing conclusion on

278

strand-preference. Secondly, we chose BSJ-spanning read counts as the indication of abundance

279

and made comparison between the host and the viral circRNAs of the same dataset. We have

280

shown that many CoV circRNAs were spliced tail-to-head. Using transcript per million (TPM) as

281

the index would greatly underestimate the abundance of CoV circRNAs. Similarly, they

282

considered the span between the 5’ and 3’ breakpoints of the BSJ is the length of the circRNA,

283

assuming that CoV circRNAs do not have FSJs, is an unreasonable way to analyze the data. For

284

our analysis, we only quantified fully assembled circRNAs predicted by CIRI2-full, rendering

285

our length analysis more reliable. Lastly, the group claimed that the number of circRNA

286

identified by their pipeline increased over the course of infection. However, our experimental

287

results suggest that the most abundant SARS-CoV-2 circRNA, 29122|28295, was highly

288

expressed at 8 hpi and was likely to down-regulated at 24 hpi (Figure 3I). Considering the

289

flexibility of circRNA BSJs, we have observed experimentally and the inaccuracy of

290

bioinformatic algorithms in calling circRNAs. We believe using a systematic approach to

291

examine circRNA expression diversity and abundance at different stages of infection is needed

292

before any conclusion could be drawn.

293

Taken together, we have demonstrated with bioinformatic analyses and experimental

294

evidence that a novel class of circRNAs are generated from SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and

295

MERS-CoV genomes. The CoV circRNA are highly diverse and abundant, comprising an

296

important part of the CoV transcriptome. Our study provide insight into the biogenesis of CoV

Cell culture, plasmid DNA transfection and SARS-CoV-2 infection

402

Vero cells (ATCC, CCL-81) and HEK 293T(ATCC® CRL-1573™) were purchased from ATCC. The

403

cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf

404

serum (FCS) and penicillin (100 IU/ml)-streptomycin (100 ug/ml) and amphotericin B (2.5 ug/ml) (33).

405

The plasmid, pCAG-nCoV-N-FLAG (34) expresses nucleocapsid (N) gene and was transfected into

406

HEK 293T cells by transfection reagent, Lipofectamine 3000 (cat# L3000015, Scientific Fisher, USA)

407

according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

408

The SARS-CoV-2 infection experiment was performed in BSL3 labs as described previously (35).

409

Eight T75 flasks of Vero E6 cells (ATCC No. CRL-1586) formed 90-100% confluency were used. After

410

washing with DMEM (Life Technologies) twice, four flasks of cell monolayers were inoculated with

411

SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain (BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH), which has been passaged one time in

412

Vero E6 cells after we received it from BEI Resources, diluted in 15 mL of DMEM supplemented with 2%

413

of heat inactivated (56°C for 30min) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 100 units penicillin/mL, 100 µg

414

streptomycin/mL, and 0.25 μg amphotericin B/mL (Sigma). We used a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of

415

0.3 based on 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50). The other four flasks were incubated with

416

medium only as mock. At 8 hours post-inoculation (hpi) and 24 hpi, we stopped incubating half of the virus-

417

inoculated and mock flasks by gently pipetting out the culture supernatant. Then we added 5 mL TRIzol™

(Invitrogen) into each flask and gently rocked the flasks to distribute the Trizol solution evenly. After

419

pipetting several times to remove all cells, we transferred the lysates to chloroform-resistance tubes. After

420

keeping the tubes in room temperature for 5 min to fully lysis the cells, we took 100 µL/sample for

421

inactivation test by performing two rounds of virus isolation in Vero E6 cells. The rest of the samples were

422

stored at -80°C. After the validation of virus inactivation, the samples were moved out of BSL3 facility for

423

circRNA analyses in BSL2 laboratories.

424
425

Experimental detection and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 circRNAs

426

Detection and analysis of SARS-CoV-2 circRNAs was performed as previously described (36). Total RNA

427

was isolated using TRizol (ThermoFisher) and Direct-zol RNA miniprep kit (Zymo) from mock-treated

428

and SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells at 8hpi and 24 hpi. RNase R (Lecigen) treatment and follow-up

429

purification (RNA Clean and Concentrator, Zymo) was performed as described in (36). If RNase R

430

treatment is opted out, 500ng total RNA was used for reverse transcription (Superscript IV, ThermoFisher)

431

with random hexamer primers (ThermoFisher). Divergent and convergent primers used in this study are

432

summarized in Table S1. PCR was performed with GoTaq Master Mix (Promega) with 1ul cDNA template

433

at 1:20 dilution. Following agarose gel (2%) electrophoresis, candidate circRNA PCR products were size-

434

selected and gel-purified (Gel purification kit, Zymo) and subcloned with TA cloning kit (ThermoFisher).

435

At least 8 colonies were checked for insertion of candidate PCR products by PCR with M13 universal

436

primers. Amplified insertions were PCR purified (DNA purification kit, Zymo) and subjected to Sanger

437

sequencing by MCLAB, CA. Sequencing results were blasted against SARS-CoV-2 reference genome

438

(NC_045512.2). 5’ and 3’ breakpoints of BSJs and FSJs were manually curated. All commercial reagents

439

were used according to manufacturer instruction.
