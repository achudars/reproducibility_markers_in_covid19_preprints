ABSTRACT
COVID-19 represents a real
threat to the global population, and
understanding the biological features of
the causative virus (SARS-CoV-2) is
imperative to aid in mitigating this threat.
Analyses of proteins such as primary
receptors and co-receptors (co-factors)
that are involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry
into host cells will provide important
clues to help control the virus. Here, we
identified host cell membrane protein
candidates that were present in proximity
to the attachment sites of SARS-CoV-2
spike proteins through the use of
proximity labeling and proteomics
analysis.
The
identified
proteins
represent candidate key factors that may
be required for viral entry. Our results
indicated that a number of membrane
proteins, including DPP4, Cadherin-17,
and CD133, were identified to
co-localize with cell membrane-bound
SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins in Caco-2
cells that were used to expand the
SARS-CoV-2 virion. We anticipate that
the information regarding these protein
candidates will be utilized for the future

INTRODUCTION
COVID-19, caused by the
SARS-CoV-2 virus, was first reported in
Wuhan, China, and now represents a
threat
to
numerous
individuals
world-wide. SARS-CoV-2 is a member
of Coronaviridae, and many of these
coronaviruses have long been known to
cause severe respiratory failure (1). It
can therefore be inferred that cells within
the respiratory organs are the growth
sites for SARS-CoV-2 virions, and the
analyses of virus receptors within these
host cells have been performed. In
addition to its ability to infect respiratory
organs, SARS-CoV-2 can also infect
vascular endothelium and the intestinal
tract (2, 3), suggesting that these viral
receptors are diverse. In SARS-CoV-1 (4,
5) and MERS-CoV (6), certain protease
family proteins within host cells have
been identified to act as primary
receptors or co-receptor (co-factors) for

tyramide; approx. 20 nm (22)), as the
generated radicals immediately react
with surrounding water molecules and
disappear close to HRP. The labeled
proteins can subsequently be analyzed
using an antibody array and/or a typical
proteome strategy (23). The EMARS
method has been applied for various
studies of molecular complexes on the
cell membrane (24–31).
Proximity labeling typically
analyzes
intracellular
molecular
interactions to allow for observations of
the proximity between free proteins. In
contrast, EMARS is a tool for analyzing
proximity molecules on the cell surface
proteins, and using this method, it is
highly possible that the key factor
proteins located in proximity to the viral
protein bound to the cell membrane at
the initial stage of virus infection can be
labeled. We therefore speculated that this
method would provide a useful tool for
identifying candidate molecules as a key
factor of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Here, we identified protein
candidates that existed in close proximity
to virus spike proteins bound to host
cells in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2
infection by using the EMARS method
and proteomics technology. The EMARS
reaction was performed using the
HRP-conjugated
recombinant
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1-RBD) in
A549 lung cancer cells and Caco2 cells.
Caco2 cells are a commonly used
cultured cell type that allow for efficient
replication of SARS-CoV-2 virions. The
labeled proteins identified as candidate
membrane proteins were analyzed using
proteomics technology.

these viruses, and in particular ACE2 has
been studied as a dominant candidate (7).
Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 has been
reported to target ACE2 and other cell
surface proteins (8).
Other
membrane
proteins
involved in virus entry should also be
noted. The chemokine receptors CCR5
and CXCR4 have been reported as
co-receptors
involved
in
human
immunodeficiency virus infection (9–11),
and HLA class II receptors function as
co-receptors in Epstein-Barr virus
infection (12). The fields of vaccine and
antiviral development are of interest in
regard to viral co-receptors (co-factors)
in addition to primary receptors (13).
Therefore, host cell membrane proteins
involved in SARS-CoV-2 attachment
and entry should be broadly considered
as the important key factors and therapy
targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the
case of SARS-CoV-2, various host cell
membrane proteins other than ACE2
have also been reported as factors that
mediate viral entry (14, 15); however,
the detailed mechanisms underlying their
functions remain unknown. It is
speculated that these factors are
membrane proteins located in proximity
to the viral attachment point (binding site
of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein) in the
host cell membrane.
The proximity labeling method
(16–19) has recently been used as a
method to analyze physiological protein
interactions. We developed a simple
physiological method termed the
Enzyme-Mediated Activation of Radical
Source (EMARS) method (20) that uses
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-induced
radicals derived from arylazide or
tyramide compounds (21). The EMARS
radicals attack and form covalent bonds
with the proteins in the proximity to the
HRP (e.g. radicals from arylazide;
approximately 200–300 nm (20), from

To perform an EMARS reaction,
an EMARS probe that possesses HRP
that is conjugated to a given molecule
that recognizes a target molecule is
required (20). The HRP-conjugated
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein corresponds
to an EMARS probe in this study (Fig.
1A). The spike protein used in this study
was a receptor-binding domain (RBD)
that is present in the S1 protein of
SARS-CoV-2 that possesses a mouse
immunoglobulin Fc region (mFc) at the
C-terminus (total 457 a. a.). We used the
mFc sequence to conjugate HRP. We
initially examined if the spike protein
binds to host cells using Caco-2 and
A549 cells. Caco-2 cells were treated
with Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescent
dye-conjugated
monovalent
spike
proteins created using a commercial
labeling kit, and labeling was then
observed using a fluorescent microscope.
We simultaneously prepared the sample
that was created through incubation with
intact spike protein-mFc followed by
incubation with anti-mouse IgG-Alexa
Fluor 488. Both samples exhibited
binding of spike protein-mFc to the cells;
however, the latter two-step staining
procedure was found to be more
effective (Fig. 1B). When each cell was
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and
then stained, the binding of spike
proteins was considerably weakened
(data not shown). Based on these results,
a method for EMARS in this study was
adopted in which the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein was directly applied to living
cells that were then treated with
HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. Similar
results were obtained using A549 cells;
however,
the
binding
of
the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was weaker
than that observed using Caco-2 cells
(Fig. 1B).
EMARS

and

proteomic

revealed a number of candidate
proteins
As ACE2 is listed as the primary
receptor for SARS-CoV-2, we examined
the expression of ACE2 in Caco-2 and
A549 cells. From western blot analyses,
a clear band was observed at a molecular
weight of approximately 100,000 Da in
Caco-2 cells; however, this signal was
faint in A549 cells (Fig. 2A). The cells
also exhibited positive staining for ACE2
antibody, demonstrating that ACE2
could be observed in both cells; however
Caco-2 cells appeared to exhibit higher
expression (Fig. 2B). Additionally,
Caco-2 cells exhibited strong staining of
portions of the cell membrane, while
A549 cells possessed a homogeneous
staining pattern (Fig. 2B).
The EMARS reaction was
performed in these cells using the
EMARS probe described above.
Following the EMARS reaction, the
labeled molecules were subjected to
SDS-PAGE. The gels used for
electrophoresis can be analyzed directly
using a fluorescence image analyzer
when the labeled molecules are present
in large amounts; however, the bands for
the EMARS sample using the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could not be
clearly detected (Data not shown). The
labeled molecules were therefore
observed by western blot analysis using
the anti-fluorescein antibody. The
EMARS reaction was first performed in
Caco-2 cells using HRP-conjugated
cholera toxin subunit B as a positive
control, as this conjugate is known to
bind to a lipid raft structure on the cell
membrane and can subsequently label
numerous cell surface proteins (Fig. 2C).
Using the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,
we performed the EMARS reaction in
conjunction with some negative control
experiments. Although weak bands were
observed in the negative control (treated

with anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody only;
hereinafter referred to as spike [-]
sample), the combination of both
SARS-CoV-2
spike
protein
and
anti-mouse
IgG-HRP
antibody
(hereinafter referred to as spike [+]
sample) yielded significant bands (Fig.
2C). As the signal was weaker compared
to that obtained using the cholera toxin
probe, it was possible that certain
specific cell membrane proteins were
labeled in a limited manner in the
samples using the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein probe. For A549 cells, a number
of labeled proteins were detected in the
spike [+] sample; however, the band
pattern was different compared to that
obtained from Caco-2 cells (Fig. 2D).
These labeled proteins were
subjected to proteomic analysis. There
was a possibility that identification could
not be sufficiently achieved using mass
spectrometry, as the amount of labeled
molecules was likely smaller than that
obtained using the CTxB-HRP probe.
Multiple independent experiments were
therefore performed (twice for Caco-2
cells and three times for A549 cell), and
the results were then combined and used
for the analysis.
Spike [+] samples and spike [-]
samples (as a negative control) were both
prepared from each cell. For shotgun
analysis using mass spectrometry, the
labeled molecules were purified by
immunoprecipitation with an
anti-fluorescein antibody. A total of 181
proteins were detected in the spike [+]
samples from Caco-2 cells, and 59
proteins were detected from the spike [-]
samples (raw data; Supporting tables 1
and 2). A total of 184 proteins were
detected in the spike [+] samples from
A549 cells, and 186 proteins were
detected from the spike [-] samples (raw
data; Supporting tables 3 and 4). The
molecules detected in the spike [-]

sample may be proteins that were
non-specifically adsorbed during the
purification process. In particular, for
unknown reasons, spike [-] sample from
A549 cells contained many suspected
non-specific binding proteins. Of the
proteins in the spike [+] sample list,
membrane proteins that were not present
in the spike [-] sample list for each cell
were preferentially specified as the most
likely candidates in this study. In Caco-2
cells, 15 types of membrane proteins and
partially cell surface proteins such as
Cadherin 17 were listed as candidates
(Table 1), and in A549 cells, 10 types of
membrane proteins such as CD44 were
listed.
The identified membrane proteins
co-localized with the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein
We next examined if the
identified membrane proteins
co-localized with the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein bound to the Caco-2 cell
membrane. Caco-2 cells were treated
with SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, and
this was followed by staining with
antibodies recognizing the above
candidates. Representative images of
ACE2, CD133, Cadherin 17, and DPP4
were summarized in Fig. 3. It was found
that all of these proteins (red signals)
were at least expressed in Caco2 cells
and co-localized with the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein (green signals).
Interestingly, it was observed that the
co-localized area was limited at specific
membrane sites, despite the observation
that these proteins were expressed
abundantly.
DISCUSSION
To date, the possibility for the
host cell proteins involved in
SARS-CoV-2 replication to be used as

therapy targets has been reported
according to proteomics-based analysis
(32). However, as viral infection first
occurs through the host cell membrane, it
is also considered to be important to
focus on membrane proteins such as the
primary viral receptor. In particular,
previous virus studies have suggested
that lipid rafts, which are assembly
structures consisting of several
membrane proteins, are important for
viral entry (33). Previous studies have
demonstrated that the EMARS reaction
used in this study is effective for
identifying proximity proteins, including
this lipid raft structure (34). It was
therefore speculated that EMARS is
suitable for investigating crucial
membrane proteins located in the
proximity region of the cell
membrane-bound SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein involved in virus entry.
It has been reported that
SARS-CoV-2 easily expands in Caco-2
cells compared to expansion in A549
cells (8, 35). One of the reasons for these
differences has been speculated to
involve the differences in ACE2
expression levels observed in these cells.
In the current study, ACE2 expression
was clearly observed in CaCo-2 cells
compared to observations in A549 cells
(Fig. 2B), thus supporting the binding
capacity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein in this study. In contrast, it has
been also reported that the expression
level of ACE2 in A549 cells is relatively
high (36) and that virus attachment could
occur even if the replication ability was
low (35). Regardless, as the binding of
the spike protein to A549 cells was
observed in this study, it was concluded
that the experiment could be performed
in both Caco-2 and A549 cells.
For preparation of the EMARS
probe, the binding capacity of the
SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the cell

membrane was assayed. We expected to
observe clear spike protein staining in
Caco-2 cells due to the high ACE2
expression in this cell line. However,
only a portion of the cell population was
able to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein, and the other cells did not
exhibit clear binding (Fig. 1B). Previous
studies examining SARS-CoV-2
infection have suggested that even in
homogeneous cell lines, the specimens
were divided into infected and
non-infected cells (2, 35). Even in HeLa
cells that overexpress ACE2, not all cells
were observed to be infected (37). This
may reflect the events observed in this
study, indicating that the cytological
images of spike protein used in this study
were similar to those of SARS-CoV-2
infection reported by other studies. The
distinction of the binding among cultured
cells is presumed to be due to the
condition of each cell population (e.g.
cell cycle, expression levels of
co-receptor [co-factors] membrane
proteins); however, the actual cause
remains unknown.
The staining experiments implied
that the amount of membrane proteins
labeled by the EMARS reaction may be
small. The labeling of molecules by
EMARS was confirmed in both Caco-2
cells and A549 cells (Fig. 2C and 2D);
however, the amount of labeled
molecules was smaller than expected and
could only be detected at the Western
blot level. Considering the loss of the
labeled protein in the purification
process and the sensitivity of shotgun
analysis by mass spectrometry, it was
necessary to combine multiple samples
obtained through multiple independent
experiments despite the non-specific
adsorption that occurs during the
purification process. In A549 cells, a
number of proteins that were expected to
be non-specific adsorbed proteins were

a regulator of B cell development
according to a knockout mouse study
(38). It has been also reported that
Cadherin 17 can influence the
progression of certain cancers (39, 40);
however there have been almost no
reports on the relationship between
Cadherin 17 and viral infection. Neither
Prominin-1 (CD133) (41) nor Glypican-3
(42) has at least been reported to be
related to viral infection, including
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Transferrin has
been reported as a co-receptor for the
hepatitis C virus (43), but its relationship
to SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been
reported. In contrast, it has been reported
that DPP4 (44) and Heterogeneous
nuclear ribonucleoprotein (45) affect
SARS-CoV-1 and/or SARS-CoV-2
infections (46, 47). In A549 cells, CD44
(48), Contactin1 (49), Cadherin-1 (50),
and Reticulon-4 receptor-like 2 (51) have
not yet been reported to exhibit any
relationship to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In contrast, it has been reported that
integrin families act as co-receptors for
other viruses (52, 53), and it has
subsequently been noted that these
proteins exhibit a relationship to
SARS-CoV-2 infection (54, 55).
Interestingly, while carcinoembryonic
antigen-related cell adhesion molecule
(CEACAM) (56, 57) has been
speculated to act as a primary receptor of
mouse coronavirus (58), a recent
network perturbation analysis suggested
a very specific influence of this molecule
in SARS-CoV-2 infection (59). Our
findings obtained in this study, including
those regarding CEACAM, and the
observed concordance of our study
results with those of previous studies
indicate that potent candidate proteins
can be obtained through the use of our
method.
The results of the confocal
microscopy experiment (Fig. 3) revealed

detected in the negative control sample
and were not subjected to the EMARS
reaction (spike [-]). We therefore decided
to select the candidate membrane
proteins using a subtraction method that
incorporated the membrane proteins
present in the samples subjected to the
EMARS reaction (spike [+]) in both cells
(Table 1). Although there was a
difference in the candidate proteins
between Caco-2 cells and A549 cells, it
was speculated that the membrane
proteins that act as co-factors for
SARS-CoV-2 entry were dependent
upon cell origin. As SARS-CoV-2 is
known to infect multiple cell types (2, 3,
35), these differences appear to be events
that must to be considered in
SARS-CoV-2 studies. In contrast, a
number of identical proteins between
Caco-2 and A549 cells, including the
transferrin receptor protein and other
(Table 1), were detected. These are
ubiquitous proteins; however, they may
still play an important role by acting as a
common target against SARS-CoV-2
infection. However, it should also be
considered that ubiquitous and highly
expressed cell membrane proteins are
more likely to be detected in proteomics.
Another factor is that ACE2 could not be
detected as a candidate protein in this
study. This raises the issue of labeling
efficiency for ACE2 by EMARS or of
fluorescein covalent binding to ACE2.
The latter is a possible issue to the
observation that the binding of certain
fluorophores can interfere with
proteomic analyses.
Cadherin 17, which exhibited the
highest score in Caco-2 cells, is a
member of the cadherin superfamily that
mediates Ca2+-dependent cell–cell
adhesion without the connection to a
cytoskeleton molecule. The
physiological functions of Cadherin 17
include the ability of this protein to act as

with PBS three times the cells were

plasma membranes, and the samples

subjected to SDS-PAGE as described
above.

that the candidate proteins co-localized
with the spike protein however, the
co-localization was not identical. It is
possible that this is attributable to the
contribution of multiple factors (e.g.
influence of the plasma membrane
environment) other than the identified
candidate proteins. It is unclear if the
strength of spike protein binding is
directly associated with SARS-CoV-2
infection efficiency.
In conclusion, the candidate
target proteins identified in this study
were partially consistent with the results
obtained by previous SARS-CoV-2
studies. Our method is therefore
considered to be effective as a tool for
identifying the host cell membrane
proteins involved in virus infection.
Additionally, it is necessary to examine
in detail if the candidate proteins newly
identified in this study are the factors
that control SARS-CoV-2 infection. We
hope that the results of this study will
help to elucidate the viral entry
mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and to
develop novel therapeutic agents in
future.

HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (mouse HRP). The EMARS products were subsequently subjected to
Western blot analysis to detect fluorescein-labeled proteins as protein neighbors. In Caco-2 cells,
HRP-conjugated Cholera Toxin B Subunit B (CTxB-HRP) was also used for the EMARS reaction as a
positive control. For loading controls, the PVDF membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue
solution (right column)

Fig. 3 Co-localization of identified proteins with cell membrane-bound SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins
Representative images of co-localization with SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and the identified membrane
proteins. Caco-2 cells were co-stained for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (green; middle column) and the
antibodies recognizing ACE2, CD133, Cadherin 17, and DPP4, respectively (Red; left column). Then, the
resulting specimens were stained with appropriate secondary antibodies and subsequently observed using
confocal microscopy (x20 objective). Co-localization was indicated as yellow in the “Merge” images (right
column).
