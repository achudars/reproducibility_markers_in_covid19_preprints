Long and complex chains of sugars, called glycans, often coat both the cell and protein surface. Glycans both modulate specific interactions and protect cells. On the
cell surface, these sugars form a cushion known as the glycocalyx. Here, we show
that Heparan Sulfate (HS) chains – part of the glycocalyx – and other glycans – expressed on the surface of both host and virus proteins – have a critical role in modulating both attractive and repulsive potentials during viral infection. We analyse the
SARS-CoV-2 virus, modelling its spike proteins binding to HS chains and two key entry receptors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We include the volume exclusion effect imposed
on the HS chains impose during virus insertion into glycocalyx and the steric repulsion caused by changes in the conformation of the ACE2 glycans involved in binding
to the spike. We then combine all these interactions, showing that the interplay of
all these components is critical to the behaviour of the virus. We show that the virus
tropism depends on the combinatorial expression of both HS chains and receptors.
Finally, we demonstrate that when both HS chains and entry receptors express at
high density, steric effects dominate the interaction, preventing infection.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), has caused over 124 million infections and over 3 million deaths worldwide
(World Health Organisation, WHO). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus of the
coronaviridae family, the same as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV), and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), two well established pathogens which emerged in the middle east in 2012 and the south of China in 2003,
respectively [1] These outbreaks have demonstrated that coronaviruses have a high zoonotic
potential, and therefore, understanding their mechanism of infection is necessary to improve
our therapeutical approach and lessen the burden on our healthcare systems[2].
The virus life cycle involves a game of multivalency to enable binding to and infection of the
host cell (Figure 1) [3]. Viruses recognise and bind to multiple cell surface receptors, either
via protein/protein or protein/glycan interaction. Different viruses target different receptors
– receptors which may have diverse sequences, structures, and cellular functions[4]. Viruses
prefer the membrane proteins involved in cell adhesion [5]. Nature tightly regulates the single
viral protein/receptor interaction or affinity and, moreover, their combination into multivalent
and multiplexed association profiles which lead to sharp response to gradients of receptors
density and give rise to the so-called super-selective binding [6].
Most human cells, particularly those that comprise biological barriers such as endothelial
and epithelial cells, have a membrane coated by a dense and complex mixture of long polysaccharides, knows as glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. These chains bind to specific proteins
forming compounds called proteoglycans. This chemical cushion, known as the glycocalyx,
has several functions, including protecting cells from chemical injury and hindering the entry
of pathogens. Several viruses have evolved to exploit these glycans, using them as an attachment factor to facilitate infection [7, 8]. SARS-CoV-2 is an example of this, binding to Heparan
Sulfate (HS), one of the most abundant components of the glycocalyx [9, 10, 11]. Additionally,
it has been shown that Heparin – a Heparan Sulfate analogue and widely used anticoagulant,
antithrombotic, and blood-thinning drug – inhibits infection in-vitro [9, 12, 11]. Several clinical reports have also suggested the therapeutic effect of heparin in both moderate and severe
COVID-19, and there are currently over 90 current clinical trials ongoing investigating this [13].
As shown in Figure 1, the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike glycoprotein interacts with the Heparan
Sulfate (HS) chains expressed by proteoglycans[14]. There are two families of proteoglycans,
Syndecans (from 1 to 4) and Glypicans (from 1 to 6); in Figure 1, we show the structure of the
most common Syndecan-1 and -4 and Glypican-1. The affinity between the virus spike and
the HS chains is dependent on the HS sequence[11]. Once the virus reaches the cell membrane, the specific binding of the receptor-binding-domain (RBD) of the spike glycoprotein (S)
to the cellular-entry receptors (R) takes place (Figure 1). Different entry receptors have been
identified for SARS-CoV-2, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or ACE2 (HCoV-NL63,
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) [15], TMPSRSS2, [15], SRB1 [16], neuropilin-1 [17]. The expression
and tissue distribution of entry receptors influence viral tropism and pathogenicity, but the cell
glycocalyx composition also plays a key role. In this paper, we present an analytical and predictive model for viral host tropism, based on the components of the cell-virus interaction during
viral attachment.

A simple model for Viral Tropism
The specificity of infection for certain viruses to hosts and host tissues, viral-host tropism, can
be described in terms of the number of viruses bound to a given combination of receptors,
or phenotype. The binding to the cell surface can be estimated using an Langmuir isotherm.
We define two surface coverages, the glycocalyx surface coverage, θG , which represents the
fraction of the glycocalyx occupied by virions, and the receptor surface coverage, θR , which
represents the fraction of the cell-surface occupied by viruses,[18, 6, 19] equal to
θG =

where ρ is the bulk viral titre (the number of virus copies per unit volume or viral load), ρG is the
viral titre in the glycocalyx, vB is the binding volume, and QR and QG are the grand canonical
partition functions for the virus in the receptors and the glycocalyx surface, respectively. The
surface coverage, θ, effectively normalises the virus binding: θ = 0 indicates no interaction and
θ = 1 indicates full saturation of the available binding sites on the surface considered. Such an
approach allows us to assess the nonlinear nature of viral binding and how it changes from zero
to saturation for very small changes of the cell’s receptor/HS composition and the spike affinities
towards them, viral size, spike number and initial viral load. The grand canonical partition functions, QG and QR , can be broken down into the product of the component partition functions
arising from all the possible binding and steric potentials acting on the virus. We can divide this

As shown in Figure 1, during the insertion into the glycocalyx, coronaviruses bind to Heparan Sulfate. Each Heparan Sulfate chain, consists of a variably sulfated repeating disaccharide
unit (Figure 2a). Only a fraction of these units bind to the virion spike proteins, normally 8
to 10 monomers or binding motifs [20]. Therefore, the total binding energy between a single
HS-chain and the virus, ϵHS , (Supporting Information) is dependent on the number of binding
motifs, NL . The more binding motifs the higher the attractive energy (Figure 2b). This energy also increases with the number of HS chains, proportional to the density of proteoglycans

(Figure 2b). The repulsive energy generated by the insertion of the virus into the HS, qHS
(Supporting Information) increases dramatically with the number of monomers per chain and
the number of chains (proteoglycan density) (Figure 2c).
Once a virus has inserted into the glycocalyx, it can bind to the ACE2 receptor via the RBD of
the spike glycoprotein (Figure 1). Upon binding, glycans at the binding site are compressed,
inducing a repulsive component to this interaction (Figure 1 (lower right panel), Figure 3a,b,
Supporting Information). The composition of these glycans can vary widely between species,
with human glycans being particularly large and complex[21]. Both host-cell proteins and viral
proteins are glycosylated, and this post-translational glycosylation process is known to play a
major role in infection virulence and interaction with the host immune system [22]. In SARSCoV-2, the spike protein typically contains 22 N-glycans [23, 24] and 2 O-glycans [23]. The
spike protein glycans shield the virus from the immune system[25], but also seems to regulate
the opening and closing of the RBD domain[26].

In Figure 3 we also analyse the influence of the trapped glycans on the dissociation constant (KD ) of the ACE2-spike protein complex. Both the number of branches and branch length
(number of monomers) decreases the KD of the complex. Our analysis explains why the same
spike proteins interacting with the same receptors are reported by several studies in human

cells with different dissociation constants; proteins expressed in HEK293T-gave a KD = 44.8 nM
[27], FreeStyle293F KD = 34.6 nM [28], while proteins expressed in insect Sf9 cells, reported
KD = 4nM [29]. Recently, Allen et al. [30] attempted to understand the influence of ACE2 glycosylation on the binding of the RBD domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The authors
chemically modified various glycan positions involved in the binding and measured the binding affinity using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The predominant type of glycan observed
across all five ACE2 glycosylated sites were fucosylated with two or three branches complextype glycans which lack galactose and sialic acid. They found that ACE2 treated with sialidase
has a higher affinity for SARS-CoV-2 compared to WT ACE2, KD 30% lower. The presence
or absence of fucose or the presence of a single N-acetylglucosamine residue did not impact
ACE2 binding to a significant extent. But when all N-linked glycans on ACE2 were converted to
oligomannose-type glycans (predominantly Man9GlcNAc2) the KD increases by 50%, corresponding to a decrease in binding. These differences, though subtle, are in perfect agreement
with our model. In Figure 3c,d we observe that the increasing glycan complexity (branching
and number of monomers per branch) increases the ACE2-RBD KD , due to the steric potential
generated by the glycan compression in the binding site. The difference between an insect glycan (Figure 3c) and a more complex glycan (human-like) with 3 to 4 branches is nearly 20 nM
(∼17.7 kT, for one glycan trapped in the binding region). According to our model, differences
in KD can be as high as 50 nM (∼16.8 kT) between a single-branched short glycan and multiplebranched long glycan, like the ones found in the human lungs (Figure 3b) [31]. Single chemical
modification does not seem to have a major role in the complex binding affinity, as glycans have
a steric role rather than a binding role. Therefore, the steric repulsion aids the dissociation of the
complex – the shorter the glycan the higher the binding energy and the lower the KD . Additionally, we also performed out-of-equilibrium simulations of the RBD-ACE2 complex dissociation,
using three different types of glycans: insect-like, high-mannose and complex. Our simulations
reveal how the force needed to break the complexes decreases when the glycan complexity
increases (Figure S1).

Viral Tropism in a nutshell
The attractive/repulsive interactions described above defines the viral tropism, via the grand
canonical partition function, QHS/R . In our model, different cell phenotypes are characterised
by the expression of proteoglycans (proteoglycan density, µm2 ) and the entry receptors (receptor density, µm2 ). Likewise, a virus can be described by the binding affinity of its spike protein
to HS and the entry receptors. In Figure 4a, we see how the HS density and the virus spike-HS
KD affects θ for cells with a specific proteoglycan density, where above a certain proteoglycan density the virus-cell interaction is switched off – this is known as range selectivity[18]. This
change from bound to unbound occurs within a very narrow range of HS densities. We can
use the experimental data collected for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV binding with
Heparin [10], to show that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher affinity toward HS: this allows SARS-CoV-2
to bind to higher HS densities, compared to the other coronavirus (Figure 4a). By analysing
the proteoglycan expression on the different tissues and cells found on the human upper and
lower airways, Figure 4b, we found that the upper airways have a proteoglycan density which
favours the attachment of SARS-CoV-2, but not SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
The ideal location for attachment of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is in regions with lower proteoglycans densities, such as the lower airways, while SARS-CoV-2 can attach and replicate in
the epithelium of the upper airways. This mean SARS-CoV-2 can infect the upper respiratory
tract and can navigate the airways more easily, as reported by virological assessment of SARSCoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV patients [32, 33]. Moreover, we can observe in Figure 4c that
the affinity of the virus for HS determines the initial viral titre require for successful attachment.
At low HS densities, Figure 4d, very low initial titres result in full surface coverage for SARSCoV-2 (Figure 4d, left) and MERS-CoV (Figure 4d, middle), while SARS-CoV needs at least 103
copies/ml in bulk to have 50% surface coverage. At medium HS densities, Figure 4e, SARS-CoV
needs at least 109 copies/ml to achieve 50% surface coverage (Figure 4e, left) and MERS-CoV
requires 105 copies/ml (Figure 4e, middle). At high HS densities, Figure 4f, MERS-CoV and
SARS-CoV, cannot bind under any condition, while SARS-CoV-2 binds for initial viral titres above

tients with mild and severe COVID-19 symptoms revealed viral titres in between 103 and 109
copies/ml [12].
Several receptors have been found responsible for SARS-CoV-2 entry and while our analysis can be expanded to all of them, we focus on the most widely discussed elements in the
SARS-CoV-2 infection, the receptors ACE2 and TMPRSS2[34]. In Figure 5a we observe how
successful viral attachment occurs when the receptors act in a synergistic manner. Cells for
which the number of ACE2 receptors account for less 40 % of the total receptor density per
µm2 , like the olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) [35, 36], have low cell surface coverage for any
percentage of TMPRSS2, therefore, low viral titre on the surface. While for cell expressing high
densities of ACE2, >60%, even moderate values of TMPRSS2 are enough to obtain high cell surface coverage values, as is the case for many cells from the human airways [37, 36], including
olfactory epithelial sustentacular cells. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection of non-neuronal
cell types leads to olfactory dysfunction (anosmia) in patients with COVID-19.

Mutations of the RBD domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are worrying due to the
higher transmissibility of these variants, especially the Brazilian (P1., K417T, E484K, N501Y),
South African (B.1.351, K417N, E484K, N501Y) and British variants (B.1.1.7, N501Y) [39, 40,
41, 42, 43, 44]. This is related to the ability of these mutations to hide the virus from antibodies [39, 42, 44] and cause reinfection [41]. The N501Y mutation shared by all three variants

also increases the binding affinity of the RBD-domain towards the ACE2, decreasing its KD [40].
However, for an optimum ratio of receptors (ACE2, TMPRSS2) densities, our model does not
predict major changes in cell surface coverage with decreasing ACE2-RBD-domain KD (Figure
5b). For high ACE2 KD values (low binding affinity) on the other hand, changes in the affinity
towards TMPRSS2 might lead to a decrease in viral titre on the cell surface according to our
model (Figure 5b).
Finally, we found that both the virion morphology and the number of available RBD-domains
in open conformation available for binding to the ACE2 affects virus titre on the cell surface.
Smaller virions ∼40 nm radius are able to attach to the host cell with fewer spikes proteins
available for binding to the entry receptors, while a bigger virus with same number of spikes
available for binding would less successful in this case and the virus titre on the cell surface will
be lower Figure 5c. Cryogenic electron microscopy on SARS-CoV-2 virions populations have
revealed an average radius of ∼45 nm with a standard deviation of ∼ 10nm, with individual
virions containing 24 ± 9 spike proteins not uniformly distributed and highly flexible [45, 38].
There is a very nonlinear response with the morphology of the virus, as shown in Figure 5c, and
a virus with a radius larger than 45 nm is less effective at attaching to cell. According to our
model, for larger virions to be as effective as viruses with a radius of 45 nm, they require more
spike proteins on their surface. By fitting the measurements provided by Ke et al. [38](Figure
5d) we observe that for all three preparations there is a clear distribution of size, but the number
of spikes per virion distributions are very broad, indicating that the size of the virus is the critical
parameter for viral attachment.

Conclusions
Overall, our model can explain the viral tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in terms of interactions with the
various host-cell components. We find that viruses are extremely selective, not only in terms of
entry receptors distribution on the host cell but also on the spike protein affinity towards the
key elements of the cell phenotype. Additionally, we find that Heparan Sulfate plays a major
role in viral infection, as the repulsion potential can dramatically decrease the number of viral
particles that can interact with the entry receptors – this increases the viral load threshold required for infection. We have also shown that the role of the glycans on the entry receptors
is not enthalpic but entropic, decreasing the binding affinity of the RBD-ACE2 complex at increasing morphological complexity. Finally, we have shown how the size of the viral particle is
a critical parameter with a nonlinear response, and therefore, induces a selection of the optimal
viral size for infection.

Methods
Out-of-equilibrium molecular dynamics . The ACE2-RDB SARS-CoV2 complex was extracted
from the cryo-em pdb structure 6M17[46]. The protein complex presented no mutations or
structural gaps. Two different systems (different glycan types) were generated by adding glycans using the Glycam web server Glycoprotein Builder tool[47], the insect-like system (DManpa13[DManpa1-6]DManpb1-4DGlcpNAcb1-4 DGlcpNAcb1-OH) and high mannose (DManpa1-6[DManpa13]DManpa1-6[DManpa1-3] DManpb1-4DGlcpNAcb1-4DGlcpNAcb1-OH). The two systems were

protein, glycans and ions force field. The final simulated systems consisted of 240K atoms, resulting in a cubic box simulation cell of 12nmx12nmx17nm. All simulations were performed
with Gromacs v2019.2 [50] with a 2fs integration step. We performed 2000 steps of minimization (steepest descent algorithm), followed by 5000 steps of isotropic NPT at 300K, using the
velocity-rescaling thermostat[51] and Parrinello-Rahman barostat[52]. After 50000 steps of NVT
the system was fully equilibrated and ready for production, which was performed in the NVT
ensemble for 100 ns. A hundred steered molecular dynamics simulations were performed for
each system using PLUMED2.6[53, 54] .
Synthetic data generation . In Table 1 we specify the model parameters fixed to generate
the data for each of the figures displayed in this article.

Theoretical Model

As discussed in the main text, binding between coronaviruses and the host cells proceeds in
a two step process. First, the virus binds to Heperan Sulfate, the long-chain sugars that coat
the cell surface. After binding to the Heperan Sulfate, the virus then can form bonds with the
receptors on the surface, particularly ACE2 and TMPRSS2.
We will define the glycocalyx surface coverage, θG , as the probability that a virus will be
bound to a HS chain at a given site, and the cell-surface coverage, θR , as the probability that a
virus will be bound to a receptor at a given site. In equation 1 in the main text, we give the general form of the surface coverage, derived from the Langmiur isotherm, which we will specialise
to deal with each case, giving
θG =

where the binding volume, vB , is determined from the viral radius, R, and the spike length, d, as
vB = π((R + d)3 − π3 R3 ) and ρ is the viral bulk concentration, and ρG is the viral concentration in
the glycocalyx. The cell-surface coverage can be linked to the glycocalyx surface coverage as
ρG = vθG
, however, in order to limit the complexity for our calculation, we treat ρG as a parameter,
B
effectively decoupling the system.
The partition functions, QG and QR , contains information about the possible states of the
system when the virus is bound to either the surface or the HS chains respectively. We can calculate the partition function taking the product of the individual contributions to the respective
partition function.

It should be noted that qinsertion

in more detail in the following subsections.

HS Binding

Each HS chain contains multiple sites to which the spike can bind. The number of these binding
sites, NL is some fraction of the number of units, Np . The number of units can be calculated from
2
the HS chain length, dHS and HS Kuhn length, bHS as Np = (dHS bHS ) .
Only a single bond can form between a given HS chain and the virus. This is likely due to the
mechanical properties of the HS chain, suggesting the entropic cost of forming an additional
bond is too high. We can, therefore, state the partition function for a single HS chain binding to
the virus in terms of the number of spikes available for binding, NS , and the HS-spike binding
energy in solution ϵHS :

HS Repulsion

As multiple HS chains will bind to a single proteoglycan, we expect the density of the HS chains
to be non-uniformly distributed, with areas of locally high density around each proteoglycan.
This means when the virus is bound only to HS chains, there will be effectively a high local
density then when the virus is bound to the receptors.
We, therefore, have to consider two cases for the steric repulsion. First, when the virus is
bound only to HS chains, and the second when the virus is bound to the receptors. For the
receptor binding case, we will take the global HS density as ρHS , while for the HS binding case
we will take the higher local density.
We can then calculate the energy of insertion in terms of the density of chains, the inserted
volume, Vµ (z), and the insertion parameter,δ This gives

From this expression, we can calculate the partition function as qinsertion = exp − finsertion

The inserted volume can be calculated geometrically by considering the distance from the
surface, z, as

Insertion Parameter
The insertion parameter quantifies how far into the brush the virus has penetrated, and is given
as the ratio between the brush length and the distance between the virus and surface. It can
be expressed in terms of the HS chain length, dHS , the distance between the virus and the cell
surface, z, and the receptor tether length, dr , as
δp =

dr + dHS

(11)

In the presence of receptor-spike binding, the cell-virus distance will be equal to the receptor
tether length, dr . However, in the absence of receptor-spike binding, situation is more complex.
We will number the binding sites of a HS chain, from n = 1, ..., NL , where n = 1 is the site
farthest from the cell surface. We can then define the distance between two sites, n and n+1, as
dn . It is not possible to identify each distance between sites, so we will assume that the distances
can be approximated by the average distance, an assumption that holds for long chain lengths
with roughly equal distribution of sites. We can then express the inter-site distance as
√
b NP
dn = dn =

(12)
(NL + 1)
The virus-cell distance can then be expressed as a function of the closest binding site to the
surface, nmax ;
{

z=
(13)
dr + dHS − nmax d otherwise.
Mean Field Approximation
As we cannot know the distance of each virus from the cell surface, we will apply a mean field
approximation, treating the repulsion as the repulsion at the average distance.
To do this, we must find the probability that a given site, n, is the closest bound site to the
surface on a given chain. This can be expressed in terms of the probability that no bonds are
formed on any HS chain at a given site, pκ = (1 − κ)NHS , where κ is the probability a given
site is bound (which can be calculated from the binding energy of a given site as described in
equation (19))
pL (n) = (1 − pκ )pκNL −n .

Receptor Interaction

As there are multiple possible receptors that the spike can bind to, we need to take a different
but equivalent approach for calculating the receptor-spike partition function. First, we define
the partition function as
(
)
freceptor
qreceptor = exp −
− 1.
(16)
kB T
Then, we can define the energy of binding in terms of the probability that a given site is
unbound, pi .

The probability of a linker being unbound can be cacluated by closure (i.e. all probabilities
must sum to 1). Defining pij as the probability linker i is bound to linker j, we have
∑
pi +
pij = 1.
(18)
j

477
478
479

Finally, we can calculate pij can be defined as the product of the probability that both i and j
are unbound and the probability that a bond will form, which is given by the Boltzmann factor
– the negative exponential of the binding energy. This gives the expression

Receptor-Spike Binding Energy

486
487

The binding energy between the spike and a given receptor has both an attractive component,
arising from the binding interaction, and a repulsive component, arising from the steric repulsion caused by trapped glycans, as discussed in the main body.
As the spike may have multiple binding sites for a given receptor, we can calculate the
receptor-spike binding energy in terms of the number of binding sites, NSite , the binding energy for a single site, ϵR , and the repulsive contribution uR , as
fR−Spike = NSite (ϵR + uR ) .

For TMPRSS2 we have only a single binding site, and we do not see the presence of glyT M P RSS2
cans upon binding. Therefore, the TMPRSS2-Spike binding energy simplifies to fR−Spike
=
T M P RSS2
ϵR
. ACE2, meanwhile, has three binding sites, and we expect to see the presence of
glycans upon binding. Therefore we need to calculate the repulsive contribution form.
We start by considering the Kuhn length of the glycans, bG ; the unit size at which each unit
can freely move, and orient in any direction. All details of chemical arrangements, bond rotation constraints, monomer-monomer interaction and monomer interaction with its local environment, are described by this parameter. A larger Kuhn length corresponds to a more rigid,
and therefore less coiled, chain.
The mean squared end-to-end distance of a coiled polymer is then given by
r20 = NG b2G ,

498

(20)

(21)

while the length of a fully extended chain is given by rmax = NG bG .
