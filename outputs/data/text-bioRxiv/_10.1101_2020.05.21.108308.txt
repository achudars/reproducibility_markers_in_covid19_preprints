Abstract
Background. Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) causes an acute illness termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Humoral immune responses likely play an important role in containing SARS-CoV-2,
however, the determinants of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses are unclear.
Methods. Using immunoassays specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we
determined SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G
(IgG) in sera and mucosal fluids of two cohorts, including patients with quantitative
reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection (n = 56; median age 61 years) with mild versus severe COVID-19, and SARSCoV-2-exposed healthcare workers (n = 109; median age 36 years) with or without
symptoms and tested negative or positive by RT-qPCR.
Findings. On average, SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgA titers in mild COVID-19
cases became positive eight days after symptom onset and were often transient, whereas
serum IgG levels remained negative or reached positive values 9–10 days after
symptom onset. Conversely, patients with severe COVID-19 showed a highly
significant increase of SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgA and IgG titers as a function of
duration since symptom onset, independent of patient age and comorbidities. Very high
levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgA correlated with severe acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS). Interestingly, some of the SARS-CoV-2-exposed
healthcare workers with negative SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG serum titers had
detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA antibodies in their nasal fluids and tears.
Moreover, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA levels in nasal fluids of these healthcare workers
were inversely correlated with patient age.

Interpretation. These data show that systemic IgA and IgG production against SARSCoV-2 develops mainly in severe COVID-19, with very high IgA levels seen in patients
with severe ARDS, whereas mild disease may be associated with transient serum titers
of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies but stimulate mucosal SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA
secretion. The findings suggest four grades of antibody responses dependent on
COVID-19 severity.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent
of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a betacoronavirus related to severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV).1-4 The zoonotic introduction of MERS-CoV and SARSCoV into the human population resulted in limited outbreaks, whereas the appearance
of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a rapidly spreading pandemic. As of May 21, 2020, COVID19 had affected about 5 million confirmed cases worldwide in more than 213 countries
and caused an estimated 330,000 deaths. Several characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 have
likely contributed to its rapid spread. These include the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to
efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract mucosa of humans,5 its variable
incubation time of about 3–14 days, and the presence of many asymptomatic and
presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals producing sufficient amounts of
virus for human-to-human transmission.6-8 Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection is frequently
unrecognized.
When symptomatic, COVID-19 can range from a mild flu-like illness in about
81% to a severe and critical disease in about 14% and 5% of affected patients,
respectively.9,10 Mild COVID-19 is characterized by fatigue, fever, sore throat, cough,
and mild pneumonia. Severe disease features dyspnea, hypoxia and radiographic
evidence of lung involvement of 50% and more. And critical COVID-19 results in acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with respiratory failure, multiorgan dysfunction,
and shock. The World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a classification of
symptomatic COVID-19 into (i) mild illness, (ii) mild pneumonia, (iii) severe
pneumonia, (iv) ARDS (based on the Berlin definition of ARDS)11, and (v) sepsis and
septic shock.12

Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as a cell entry receptor
for SARS-CoV-2. Pneumocytes and other host cells expressing ACE2 are therefore
particularly susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2
binds to ACE2 via the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of its surface
spike (S) glycoprotein.3,13 Thus, humoral immunity targeting the S protein could
interfere with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as evidenced from serological studies.14,15
As with other coronaviruses, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 disease causes an
acute infection with activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems. The former
leads to the release of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6,
whereas other anti-viral cytokines, such as the type I and III interferon pathways, are
hampered

by

coronaviruses,

including

SARS-CoV

and

SARS-CoV-2.16-18

Subsequently, B and T cells become activated, resulting in the production of SARSCoV-2-specific antibodies, comprising immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin A
(IgA), and immunoglobulin G (IgG). Whereas coronavirus-specific IgM production is
transient and leads to isotype switch to IgA and IgG, these latter antibody subtypes can
persist for extended periods in the serum and in nasal fluids.19 Whether SARS-CoV-2specific IgG antibodies correlate with virus control is a matter of intense
discussions.14,15,20
Unlike the internal nucleocapsid protein (NC) of SARS-CoV-2, that shares
about 90% amino acid sequence homology with the NC of SARS-CoV, the S1 subunit
shares only 64% amino acid sequence homology and shows limited homology with
other human coronaviruses, such as 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1, which use
different viral entry receptors.3,21 Thus, antibodies generated to previous coronavirus
infections are unlikely to cross-react with the S1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 and should
therefore not significantly account for any seroreactivity toward the S1 subunit.21

Despite intensive research efforts, several determinants of SARS-CoV-2specific antibody production remain ill-defined, such as its relation to COVID-19
severity, disease duration, patient age, and comorbidities. There is also a paucity of
knowledge on SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG antibodies at mucosal sites and how
their levels correlate with COVID-19 parameters. And, finally, it is unclear whether
tissue-associated IgA and IgG secretion, rather than their systemic production, might
be evident in SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals undergoing mild disease.

Methods
Human subjects and patient characteristics
Following written informed consent, patients and healthcare workers were recruited for
sampling of blood and mucosal secretions. We studied two cohorts, including patients
with quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 56; median age 61 years) with mild versus
severe COVID-19, and healthcare workers possibly exposed to SARS-CoV-2-infected
patients (termed HCW cohort; n = 109; median age 36 years) with or without symptoms
who tested negative or positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR. Possibly exposed was
defined as a contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient for more than 15 minutes, at
less than 2 meters, and without adequate safety measures. Because of pre-existing
comorbidities, seven patients were under immunosuppressive treatments, which
comprised corticosteroids at stable doses, whereas patients taking B cell-depleting
agents, such as rituximab,22 were excluded. For longitudinal analyses of serum and
mucosal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses two subjects with mild COVID-19
were sampled repeatedly during their disease course. Our COVID-19 patients were
classified according to the WHO criteria12 into (a) mild cases, comprising mild illness
and mild pneumonia, versus (b) severe cases, including severe pneumonia and ARDS;
our cohort did not contain any patients with sepsis or septic shock. The study was
approved by the Cantonal Ethics Committee of Zurich (BASEC #2016-01440).

Collection of serum, tears, nasal fluid and saliva
A subgroup of the HCW cohort (termed HCW mucosal subgroup; n = 33) volunteered
to be sampled for blood as well as, simultaneously, tears, nasal fluid, and saliva. Venous
blood samples were collected in BD Vacutainer CAT serum tubes (Becton Dickinson).

Tears were sampled using filter paper produced for Schirmer tear tests (HS Clement
Clarke Ophtalmic). Nasal fluids were collected by inserting a dry soft tissue into the
nasal cavities for 5 minutes. Unstimulated saliva was collected for 5 minutes.

IgA and IgG immunoassays
A commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specific for the S1 protein
of SARS-CoV-2 was used according to manufacturer's instructions (Euroimmun
SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG immunoassay) and validated by using serum samples of
hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 as positive controls and serum samples
collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic as negative controls. The results showed a
specificity for anti-S1 IgA of >95% and anti-S1 IgG >99%, which is in accordance with
recently published data.23 Serum samples were analyzed at a 1:100 dilution and mucosal
samples at a 1:5 dilution. For serum IgA, optical density (OD) ratios of 1.1–2.0 were
considered borderline positive and values above 2.0 positive. For serum IgG, OD ratios
of 0.8–1.1 were considered borderline positive and values above 1.1 positive.
Furthermore, we assessed the samples of the HCW mucosal subgroup using an
in-house immunoassay for IgA and IgG against S protein extracellular domain (ECD),
RBD, and NC. Mucosal samples were pre-diluted 1:2 in sample buffer (PBS Tween-20
0.1%, 1% milk) and serum was pre-diluted 1:20 in sample buffer and transferred to
antigen-coated 1536-well assay plates using acoustic dispensing technology (Labcyte
ECHO 555) with serial dilutions ranging from 1:5–1:640 (mucosal samples) and 1:50–
1:6400 (serum). Following a two-hour incubation at room temperature, plates were
washed 5 times with PBS Tween-20, 0.1%, and HRP-conjugated antibody (peroxidase
AffiniPure goat anti-human IgG, Fcγ fragment specific, Jackson) was added in sample
buffer. Plates were washed three times with PBS Tween-20, 0.1%, the chromogenic

substrate was added and the reaction was stopped with sulphuric acid after three
minutes of incubation. ODs were measured at 450 nm in a multimode plate reader
(Perkin Elmer EnVision), followed by fitting with a logistic regression and
determination of the inflection point of the sigmoidal curve (-log(EC50)). Negative
values were depicted as 0.

Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)
Nasopharyngeal swabs were subjected to RT-qPCR using the TaqMan SARS-CoV-2
Assay Kit v2 (Thermo Fischer), the 2019-nCoV CDC qPCR Probe Assay (2019-nCov
CDC EUA Kit; Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.), or the Roche Cobas SARS-CoV2 Test CE-IVD (Roche) according to manufacturers' instructions. The cycle threshold
(Ct) values for the different SARS-CoV-2 PCR targets were compounded and reported
as averages.

Statistics
Descriptive statistics for the cohort of patients (stratified by mild versus severe disease)
and the HCW cohort are presented as median and interquartile ranges for continuous
variables, as well as numbers and percentages of total for categorical variables. For the
comparison of location parameters in two independent groups, the Wilcoxon's rank sum
test was used, in a version accounting for ties.24 For the comparison of more than two
independent groups, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used. Multiple linear
regression models were used to quantify the association between log-transformed IgA
and IgG levels as outcomes as well as a set of pre-defined independent variables. These
included disease severity, age, duration of symptoms (days) and patient comorbidities.

Generalized additive models were used to evaluate potential non-linear relationships of
disease duration with the two outcomes, as described above.
Statistical analysis were performed with R (version 3.6.1) and using the
packages "coin" and "mgcv". Graph-Pad Prism was used for visualizations. P-values
were adjusted for multiple testing, using the method proposed by BenjaminiHochberg.25 Adjusted p-values were considered statistically significant if smaller than
the significance level of  = 0.05. In the HCW mucosal subgroup evidence was
quantified on a continuous scale, and these results were considered exploratory.

Results
COVID-19 severity, disease duration, and patient age influence SARS-CoV-2specific serum IgA and IgG secretion.
Serum samples of 56 RT-qPCR-confirmed mild (n = 19) and severe (n = 37) COVID19 cases (Table 1) were assessed for IgA and IgG antibodies toward the SARS-CoV-2
S1 protein by using highly-specific immunoassays. The mean period between reported
symptom onset and serum collection were 16.4 days (median 13 days) in the mild
COVID-19 group and 20.9 days (median 16 days) in the severe COVID-19 group of
patients, respectively, which was not significantly different between these two groups
(p = 0.17; Supplementary Figure S1A). In comparison to mild COVID-19, patients
with severe disease had on average higher serum titers of S1-specific IgA (p = 0.0006)
and IgG (p = 0.0009) (Figure 1A). In mild COVID-19 cases, serum titers of S1-specific
IgA increased slightly as a function of disease duration (p = 0.003), as calculated from
symptom onset to the time of serum sampling (Figure 1B). Likewise, serum titers of
S1-specific IgG increased moderately (p = 0.055) in mild cases (Figure 1B). These
antibody responses revealed no significant pattern associated with patient age (p =
0.067 for IgA, and p = 0.18 for IgG) (Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S1B),
gender (Supplementary Figure S1C and S1D), pre-existing comorbidities, including
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lung disease,
kidney disease, and malignancy, or immunosuppressive treatment (Supplementary
Figure S2 and Table 2).
On average, positive S1-specific serum IgA titers became evident in mild
COVID-19 cases eight days after symptom onset (Figure 1B). S1-specific serum IgA
levels peaked in samples drawn at around three weeks from symptom onset, whereas
in subjects tested later S1-specific serum IgA tended to be lower. As for S1-specific

serum IgG concentrations, these remained negative or reached positive values in mild
COVID-19 patients on average 9–10 days after symptom onset (Figure 1B).
In stark contrast to mild cases, patients suffering from severe COVID-19
showed a strong correlation of serum titers of S1-specific IgA with disease duration (p
= 0.001), which was even more pronounced for serum titers of S1-specific IgG (p =
0.0002) (Figure 1B). These antibody responses became positive on average in samples
obtained on day 3–4 for IgA and day 4–5 for IgG, and they appeared to be independent
of patient age (p = 0.80 for IgA, and p = 0.72 for IgG), gender, and comorbidities
(Figure 1B and 1C, Supplementary Figure S1B, S1C and S2, and Table 2).
When grouped according to level of care into outpatient care and
hospitalization, we observed in cases with mild COVID-19 that S1-specific serum IgA
levels did not show any discernible pattern (Figure 2A). Contrarily, S1-specific serum
IgG titers clustered according to level of care with hospitalized patients showing higher
IgG titers than outpatient cases (Figure 2A), likely reflecting disease severity. Thus,
we next assessed disease severity, grouping the patients according to the WHO
classification criteria into mild illness without pneumonia, mild pneumonia, severe
pneumonia, mild ARDS, moderate ARDS, and severe ARDS. As expected, younger
patients tended to have milder disease, and older patients more severe manifestations
(Supplementary Figure S3). There was no time-dependent pattern visible for S1specific serum IgA, whereas S1-specific serum IgG titers showed a stronger increase
over time in mild pneumonia cases versus those with mild illness (Figure 2B).
Strikingly, very high levels (>25 optical density [OD] ratio) of SARS-CoV-2-specific
serum IgA, but not serum IgG, correlated with severe ARDS (Figure 2B and
Supplementary Figure S4). In a multiple linear model on all patients, there was strong
evidence for an association of severe disease and days after symptom onset with an

increase of S1-specific serum IgA and IgG responses. Immunosuppressive therapy was
weakly associated with decreased of S1-specific serum IgG levels (Table 2).
In summary, these data show that disease severity influences S1-specific serum
IgA and IgG titers, and S1-specific serum IgA of 25 OD ratio and higher might serve
as a biomarker of severe ARDS. Furthermore, the data suggest that S1-specific IgA
responses might occur transiently in patients with mild disease. To evaluate this latter
hypothesis, we conducted a longitudinal study in two selected patients with mild
COVID-19, as presented below.

S1-specific antibody responses can be transient and delayed in mild COVID-19.
We followed up two adults (a 42-year old woman and a 42-year old man, living together
as a couple) with mild, RT-qPCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. He (patient
COV2-A0013) developed fatigue and cough from day 0 on, followed by fever on day
1 and dysosmia on days 9–16. She (patient COV2-A0014) showed signs of fatigue and
sore throat from day 0 on, fever between days 2–5, and cough on day 3 (Figure 3A).
The RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values at detection were low on days 1–20
for patient COV2-A0013 and day 7 for patient COV2-A0014, indicating the presence
of high amounts of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their nasal swabs (Figure 3B). On day 30
for patient COV2-A0013 and from day 17 on for patient COV2-A0014, the Ct values
increased to 40 and more, thus indicating that the amount of virus RNA had dropped
below the detection limit (Figure 3B).
Patient COV2-A0013 showed S1-specific serum IgA titers that were negative
on day 7, rose to borderline values on day 10, became positive on day 14 at a titer of
3.8 OD ratio where they remained on day 20 and further increased to a titer of 8.5 OD
ratio on day 30; his S1-specific serum IgG titers remained negative on days 7–14,

became borderline positive on day 20 and clearly positive at an OD ratio of 4.5 on day
30 (Figure 3C). Conversely, S1-specific serum IgA titers in patient COV2-A0014 were
borderline on day 4, became positive on days 7 and 11, followed by a drop to borderline
values on days 17 and 28; her S1-specific serum IgG levels were negative on days 4–
7, became borderline on day 11 and weakly positive at an OD ratio of 1.1 on day 17
and remained weakly positive at an OD ratio of 1.8 on day 28 (Figure 3C). We
compared these results to longitudinal analyses of S1-specific serum IgA and IgG
values in two different situations. In asymptomatic control healthcare workers, S1specific serum IgA and IgG remained negative throughout the period of assessment,
whereas both antibodies showed a rapid increase from day 4–5 on in severe COVID19 cases (Supplementary Figure S5).
Together with our aforementioned results of the 19 RT-qPCR-confirmed mild
COVID-19 cases these longitudinal data in two mild COVID-19 cases demonstrate that
S1-specific serum IgA production can be transient, whereas S1-specific serum IgG
production occurs late, usually 17–20 days after onset of symptoms or can remain
negative. Thus, collectively, these findings show that the amount of S1-specific SARSCoV-2 IgG serum levels correlate with the severity of clinical symptoms.

Individuals with possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure show virus-specific IgA at
mucosal sites without evidence of virus-specific antibodies in serum.
Having observed that in mild COVID-19 cases, S1-specific serum IgA and IgG
production can be transient, delayed or even absent, we assessed serum S1-specific
antibody responses in a well-defined cohort of healthcare workers possibly exposed to
SARS-CoV-2 (n = 109; termed HCW cohort). These healthcare workers either did or
did not have clinical symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, and they either tested

negative or positive for SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory secretions by RT-qPCR. We
grouped them as follows (Figure 4): (i) asymptomatic, RT-qPCR negative
(Asymp/PCR-; n = 17); (ii) symptomatic, RT-qPCR negative (Symp/PCR-; n = 71);
and (iii) symptomatic, RT-qPCR positive (Symp/PCR+; n = 21).
The Asymp/PCR- group contained very few S1-specific serum IgA-positive and
no IgG-positive subjects (Figure 5A). Conversely, there were four out of 71 (6%)
participants with positive IgA and IgG values found in the Symp/PCR- group, which
likely represented individuals that had had a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 5A).
As expected, the Symp/PCR+ group contained more seropositive individuals, with 8
out of 21 (38%) subjects having positive IgA and IgG titers for S1 of SARS-CoV-2 at
the time of sampling (Figure 5A).
To investigate S1-specific IgA and IgG levels at mucosal sites, we analyzed
tears, nasal fluids, and saliva in a subset of the HCW cohort, termed HCW mucosal
subgroup (Figure 4). This subgroup also recorded self-reported clinical symptoms
related to their possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure (Table 3). When assessing the
Symp/PCR+ members of the HCW mucosal subgroup, a clear correlation was evident
between positivity of S1-specific IgA and IgG in serum (Figure 5B) with the
corresponding values in nasal secretions (Figure 5C). Thus, for S1-specific IgG,
Symp/PCR+ members with positive serum titers also showed elevated levels of S1specific IgG in nasal secretions (Figure 5B and 5C), possibly indicating transfer of S1specific IgG from serum to the nasal mucosa. Conversely, the relationship of serum
versus nasal fluid in Symp/PCR+ members was more variable for S1-specific IgA
(Figure 5B and 5C).
To further investigate these findings, we adapted and used our two SARS-CoV2 S protein-specific immunoassays (Supplementary Figure S6 and S7) to assess the

subjects in the HCW mucosal subgroup that tested negative for SARS-CoV-2-specific
IgA or IgG in serum. Firstly, we ruled out an influence by sampling time since symptom
onset or total amount of detectable polyspecific IgA and IgG in our samples. Time of
sampling since symptom onset was 26.5 days for both Symp/PCR- and Symp/PCR+
groups of the HCW mucosal subgroup, whereas the Asymp/PCR- group was tested
more than 11 days after exposure. Total polyspecific IgA and IgG levels were
comparable in serum samples as well as tear, nasal fluid and saliva samples of all three
groups of participants (Supplementary Figure S8). Notably, whereas total
polyspecific IgG levels were measurable in nasal fluids, they were very low in tear fluid
and saliva (Supplementary Figure S8). Analyzing S protein-specific IgA and IgG in
our mucosal samples, we observed a reliable correlation between our two
immunoassays for serum IgA and IgG, tear fluid IgA, and nasal fluid IgA, whereas the
other measurements were not consistent and were thus not considered for our
conclusions (Supplementary Figure S7).
Interestingly, we were able to detect S protein-specific IgA in the mucosal
samples of several subjects in the absence of seropositivity. Analyzing individual
participants, we found that subjects COV2-M0033, COV2-M0061, and COV2-M0103
showed high S1-specific, ECD-specific and RBD-specific IgA values in their nasal
fluids, whereas total IgA values were average in nasal fluids of these individuals
(Figure 5D–5F and Supplementary Figure S8). Moreover, the nasal fluid of subject
COV2-M0015 contained high S1-specific and RBD-specific IgA values, in the
presence of average total IgA values (Figure 5D–5F and Supplementary Figure S8).
When measuring their tear fluids, subjects COV2-M0015 and COV2-M0033 presented
with high S1-specific, ECD-specific or RBD-specific IgA values (Figure 5G–5I).

Additionally, a few other individuals also had detectable S protein-specific IgG in their
nasal fluids despite being IgG seronegative (Figure 5D–5F).
In contrast to total IgA values, assessing S protein-specific IgA values in nasal
fluid versus age in seronegative healthcare workers, we found an inverse correlation (p
= 0.037) (Figure 5J and 5K). The same analysis with S protein-specific IgA titers in
serum versus age, however, did not reveal a correlation (p = 0.58) (Figure 5L).
Collectively, these data suggest that mucosal SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific
IgG antibody levels are related to systemic titers of these antibodies. Interestingly, in
15–20% of S protein-seronegative individuals, we were able to detect S protein-specific
IgA antibodies at several mucosal sites. Furthermore, mucosal S protein-specific IgA
levels inversely correlated with patient age, suggesting increased mucosal antibody
responses in younger SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals.

Discussion
In severe cases of COVID-19, we found that SARS-CoV-2 S protein-specific serum
IgA and IgG titers became positive in samples obtained on average 3–5 days after
symptom onset, which is in agreement with earlier publications.14 These antibody
responses showed a strong correlation with disease duration, but they were independent
of patient age, gender, and pre-existing comorbidities. Strikingly, very high serum titers
of S protein-specific IgA, but not IgG, correlated with severe ARDS, thus warranting
further studies evaluating the role of IgA in SARS-CoV-2-associated severe ARDS.
Conversely, in mild cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, S protein-specific serum
IgA production was transient, delayed or even absent, accompanied by an S proteinspecific serum IgG response that occurred late or remained negative. Interestingly,
however, we found evidence of S protein-specific IgA and IgG at mucosal sites of
individuals with mild COVID-19. There, mucosal S protein-specific IgG levels
appeared to mirror the systemic, i.e. serum, titers of these antibodies. Mucosal S
protein-specific IgA levels, however, were even detectable at several mucosal sites of
about 15–20% S protein-seronegative individuals. Interestingly, mucosal S proteinspecific IgA levels correlated inversely with patient age.
We think these findings suggest a model where the extent and duration of
SARS-CoV-2-related clinical symptoms, which likely correlates with virus replication,
dictates the level of virus-specific humoral immunity. This hypothesis is consistent with
previous publications demonstrating that the magnitude of the humoral response toward
SARS-CoV-2 is dependent on the duration and magnitude of viral antigen exposure.26,27
Low antigen exposure will elicit mucosal IgA-mediated responses, which can be
accompanied by systemic IgA production; however, systemic virus-specific IgA
responses can also be absent, transient or delayed. This type of "mucosal IgA" antibody

response seemed to be particularly prevalent in younger individuals with mild SARSCoV-2 infection without evidence of pneumonia. These projected longitudinal
relationships from cross-sectional evaluations need confirmation in longitudinal
studies. Notably, of our two longitudinal subjects, patient COV2-A0014 showed milder
and shorter clinical symptoms and more rapid virus clearance, which was associated
with transient S protein-specific IgA and delayed IgG production, but high levels of S
protein-specific IgA in her nasal fluid (Supplementary Figure S9).
These data might be a reflection of increased mucosal immunity in the young
or decreased mucosal immunity in the old. Along these lines, previous data on
coronavirus seroprevalence of HKU1-specific IgG showed an absence of systemic
HKU1-specific antibodies in individuals younger than 20 years of age, with increasing
seroprevalence with increasing age.28 Extrapolating this model to comprise also
children and infants, it is conceivable that children and infants have primed mucosal
innate and IgA antibody responses due to their frequent upper respiratory tract
infections and, therefore, respond preferentially in this manner to SARS-CoV-2
infection. This hypothesis might also explain why children rarely present with
symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Looking at the other end of the age sprectrum,
previous studies have shown that the kinetics and strength of antiviral immune
responses, including T cell activation and proliferation, becomes slower with increasing
age.29,30 The elucidation of these questions and the confirmation of our findings will
require larger studies. However, due to the transient nature of S protein-specific
antibody responses in oligosymptomatic patients, large scale measurement of systemic
SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG levels in asymptomatic patients will reveal limited
epidemiological information. In addition to serum, mucosal measurements of SARSCoV-2-specific IgA should be considered.

With increased SARS-CoV-2-related clinical symptoms, and hence antigen
exposure, we observed a "systemic IgA and IgG" type of antibody response,
characterized by S protein-specific IgA that may be transient or delayed and the
presence of S protein-specific IgG. With even further increasing clinical severity, we
found high to very high serum IgA and high IgG responses in severe cases and ARDS.
Thus, our findings suggest four grades of antibody responses dependent on COVID-19
severity with (i) oligosymptomatic disease and mucosal antibody responses in the
absence of systemic antibody production, (ii) mild-to-moderate disease and transient or
delayed systemic IgA and IgG production, (iii) severe cases with high serum IgA and
high IgG responses, and (iv) very severe cases, including severe ARDS, with very high
serum IgA and high IgG titers.
Whether these S protein-specific antibody responses confer immunity to a
secondary infection with SARS-CoV-2 is a matter of intense debate. Previous
publications indicated that S protein-specific serum IgG antibodies correlated with
virus neutralization in vitro,14,15 although some publications questioned the efficacy of
neutralization by these antibody responses.20 Based on correlative data from the SARS
outbreak and preclinical SARS infection models,31 there has been discussion on a
contribution of the humoral immune response to immune pathology,32,33 potentially by
augmenting the proinflammatory monocyte response in the lungs. However, trials with
convalescent serum treatments have shown promising results during the current
COVID-19 pandemic and also in SARS.34 Another caveat relates to the durability of
protective humoral immunity. Whether S protein-specific mucosal IgA responses
confer immunity to a secondary infection with SARS-CoV-2 remains to be seen. We
are currently assessing S protein-specific mucosal IgA antibodies in virus neutralization
assays as well as following-up our patient cohort longitudinally to address these issues.

109). Dashed lines indicate borders between positive (red), borderline (gray) and
negative (blue) values, with gray shaded area highlighting borderline values.
(B) S protein-specific IgA (top) and IgG (bottom) serum levels of the Symp/PCR+
group (n = 11) in the HCW mucosal subgroup. Comparison of healthcare workers with
negative, borderline, and positive values.
(C) S protein-specific IgA (top) and IgG (bottom) nasal fluid levels of the Symp/PCR+
group (n = 11) in the HCW mucosal subgroup. Comparison of healthcare workers with
negative, borderline, and positive values.
(D–F) S protein-specific IgA (top) and IgG (bottom) levels in nasal fluid, including S1specific IgA and IgG (D), SARS-CoV-2 S protein extracellular domain (ECD)-specific
IgA and IgG (E), SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific
IgA and IgG (F) of S1 protein-seronegative individuals of the HCW mucosal subgroup.
Comparison of Asymp/PCR-, Symp/PCR- and Symp/PCR+ HCW is shown. Four PCR
negative healthcare workers with negative S protein-specific IgA values in serum, but
increased S protein-specific IgA levels in nasal fluids are labeled with their
corresponding study code.
(G–I) S protein-specific IgA (top) and IgG (bottom) levels in tear fluid, including S1specific IgA and IgG (G), ECD-specific IgA and IgG (H), RBD-specific IgA and IgG
(I) of S1 protein-seronegative individuals of the HCW mucosal subgroup.
(J–L) Linear modeling of total polyspecific IgA in nasal fluids (J) and S1 proteinspecific IgA in nasal fluids (K), and of S1 protein-specific IgA serum levels (L), all as
