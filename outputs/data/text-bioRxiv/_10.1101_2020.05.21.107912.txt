Abstract
The COVID-19 respiratory disease is caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2,
which uses the enzyme ACE2 to entry human cells. This disease is characterized by
important damages at multi-organ level, partially due to the abundant expression of
ACE2 in practically all human tissues. However, not every organ in which ACE2 is
abundant is aﬀected by SARS CoV-2, which suggests the existence of other multi-organ
routes for transmitting the perturbations produced by the virus. We consider here
diﬀusive processes through the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of proteins
targeted by SARS CoV-2 as such alternative route. We found a subdiﬀusive regime
that allows the propagation of virus perturbations through the PPI network at a
significant rate. By following the main subdiﬀusive routes across the PPI network we
identify proteins mainly expressed in the heart, cerebral cortex, thymus, testis, lymph
node, kidney, among others of the organs reported to be aﬀected by COVID-19.

Introduction

Since December 2019 a new coronavirus designated SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) (1 ) has produced an outbreak of pulmonary
disease which has soon became a global pandemic (2 , 3 ). The new coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) is characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations
(4 , 5 ), with an important implication of multi-organ and systemic dysfunctions
(6 , 7 ), which include heart failure, renal failure, liver damage, shock and multiorgan failure. The new coronavirus shares about 82% of its genome with the one
which produced the 2003 outbreak (SARS CoV) (8 ). Both coronaviruses share
the same cellular receptor, which is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
receptor (8 , 9 , 10 ). ACE2 receptors are enriched in several tissues across the
organs, such as in alveolar epithelial type II cells of lung tissues, in the heart,
endothelium, kidneys and intestines. Therefore, ACE2 has been hypothesized
as a potential cause of the major complications of the COVID-19 (11 , 12 ).

1 Introduction

However, it has been found that ACE2 has abundant expression on endothelia
and smooth muscle cells of virtually all organs (13 ). Therefore, it should be
expected that after SARS CoV-2 is present in circulation, it can be spread
across all organs. In contrast, both SARS CoV and SARS CoV-2 are found
specifically in some organs but not in others, as shown by in situ hybridization
studies for SARS CoV [13]. This was already remarked by Hamming et al.
(13 ) by stressing that it “is remarkable that so few organs become viruspositive,
despite the presence of ACE2 on the endothelia of all organs and SARS-CoV in
blood plasma of infected individuals”.
Recently Gordon et al. (14 ) identified human proteins that interact physically with those of the SARS CoV-2 forming a high confidence SARS-CoV-2human protein-protein interactions (PPIs) system. Using this information Gysi
et al. (15 ) discovered that 208 of the human proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2
forms a connected component inside the human PPI network. That is, these 208
are not randomly distributed across the human proteome but they are closely
interconnected by short routes that allow moving from one to another in just
a few steps. These interdependencies of protein-protein interactions are known
to enable that perturbations on one interaction propagates across the network
and aﬀect other interactions (16 , 17 , 18 , 19 ). In fact, it has been signified that
diseases are a consequence of such perturbation propagation (20 , 21 , 22 ). It
has been stressed that the protein-protein interaction process requires diﬀusion
in their initial stages (23 ). The diﬀusive processes occur when proteins, possibly
guided by electrostatic interactions, need to encounter each other many times
before forming an intermediate (24 ). Not surprisingly, diﬀusive processes have
guided several biologically oriented searches in PPI networks (25 , 26 ). Therefore, we assume here that perturbations produced by SARS CoV-2 proteins on
human PPI network are propagated by means of diﬀusive processes. However,
due to the crowded nature of the intra-cell space and the presence in it of spatial barriers, subdiﬀusive processes more than normal diﬀusion are expected for
these protein-protein encounters (27 , 28 , 29 ). This creates another diﬃculty,
as remarked by Batada et al. (23 ), which is that such (sub)diﬀusive processes
along are not suﬃcient for carrying out cellular processes at a significant rate
in cells.
Here we propose the use of a time-fractional diﬀusion model on the PPI
network of proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2. The goal is to model the propagation of the perturbations produced by the interactions of human proteins
with those of SARS CoV-2 through the whole PPI. The subdiﬀusive process
emerging from the application of this model to the SARS-CoV-2-human PPIs
has a very small rate of convergence to the steady state. However, this process
produces dramatic increment of the probability that certain proteins are perturbed at very short times. This kind of shock wave eﬀect of the transmission
of perturbations occurs at much earlier times in the subdiﬀusive regime than
at the normal diﬀusion one. Therefore, we propose here a switch and restart
process in which a subdiﬀusive process starts at a given protein of the PPI,
perturbs a few others, which then become the starting point of a new subdiﬀusive processm and so on. Using this approach we then analyze how the initial

interaction of the SARS CoV-2 Spike protein with a human protein propagates
across the whole network. We discover some potential routes of propagation
of these perturbations from proteins mainly expressed in the lungs to proteins
mainly expressed in other diﬀerent tissues, such as the heart, cerebral cortex,
thymus, lymph node, testis, prostate, liver, small intestine, duodenum, kidney,
among others.

Time-fractional diﬀusion model on networks

In this work we always consider Γ = (V, E) to be an undirected finite network
with vertices V representing proteins and edges E which represent the interaction between pairs of proteins. Let us consider 0 < α ≤ 1 and a function
u : [0, ∞) → R, then we denote by Dtα u the fractional Caputo derivative of u of
order α, which is given by (31 )
∫
Dtα u (t) =

t

g1−α (t − τ ) u′ (τ ) dτ := (g1−α ∗ u′ ) (t) ,

t > 0,

0
γ−1

where ∗ denotes the classical convolution product on (0, ∞) and gγ (t) := tΓ(γ) ,
for γ > 0. Observe that the previous fractional derivative has sense whenever
the function is derivable and the convolution is defined (for example if u′ is
locally integrable). The notation gγ is very useful in the fractional calculus
theory, mainly by the property gγ ∗ gδ = gγ+δ for all γ, δ > 0.
Here we propose to consider the time-fractional diﬀusion (TFD) equation on
the network as
Dtα x (t) = −CLx (t) ,
(1)
with initial condition x (0) = x0 , where xi (t) is the probability that protein i is
perturbed at time t, C is the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of the network, which we will
set hereafter to unity, and L is the graph Laplacian, i.e., L = K − A, where K
is a diagonal matrix of node degrees and A is the adjacency matrix. This model
was previously studied in distributed coordination algorithms for the consensus
of multi-agent systems (32 , 33 , 34 ). The use of fractional calculus in the context
of physical anomalous diﬀusion has been reviewed by Metzler and Klafter (30 ).
The solution of this TFD equation is given by:
x (t) = Eα,1 (−tα L) x0 .

This result indicates that in an undirected and connected network, the diﬀusive
process controlled by the TFD equation always reaches a steady state which
consists of the average of the values of the initial condition. Also, because the
network is connected µ2 makes the largest contribution to Eα,1 (−tα L) among
all the nontrivial eigenvalues of L. Therefore, it dictates the rate of convergence of the diﬀusion process. We remark that in practice the steady state
limt→∞ ∥xv (t) − xw (t)∥ = 0, ∀v, w ∈ V is very diﬃcult to achieve. Therefore,
we use a threshold ε, e.g., ε = 10−3 , such that limt→∞ ∥xv (t) − xw (t)∥ = ε is
achieved in relatively small simulation time.
Due to its importance in this work we remark the structural meaning of the
Mittag-Leﬄer function of the Laplacian matrix appearing in the solution of the
TFD equation. That is, Eα,1 (−tα L) is a matrix function, which is defined as
Eα,1 (−tα L) =

where Γ (·) is the Euler gamma function. We remark that for α = 1 we recover
the diﬀusion equation on the network: dx (t) /dt = −Lx (t) and its solution
E1,1 (−tα L) = exp (−tCL) is the well-known heat kernel of the graph.

2.2

Time-fractional diﬀusion distance

We define here a generalization of the diﬀusion distance studied by Coifman
and Lafon (35 ). We start by defining
Dvw = f (τ L)vv + f (τ L)ww − 2f (τ L)vw

(8)

where f (τ L) = Eα,1 (−t L) . In the Supplementary Note 2 we prove that Dvw
is a square Euclidean distance between the nodes v and w. Let µj be the jth
eigenvalue and ψju the uth entry of the jth eigenvector of the Laplacian matrix.
Then, we can write the time-fractional diﬀusion distance as
α

Dvw =

It is evident that when α = 1, Dvw is exactly the diﬀusion distance previously
studied by Coifman and Lafon (35 ). The fractional-time diﬀusion distance
between every pair of nodes in a network can be represented in a matrix form
as follow:
(
)◦1/2
T
Σ (τ ) = ⃗s (τ ) ⃗1T + ⃗1⃗s (τ ) − 2f (τ L)
,

(10)

where ⃗s = [f (τ L)11 , f (τ L)22 , · · · , f (τ L)nn ] is a vector whose entries are the
main diagonal terms of the Mittag-Leﬄer matrix function, ⃗1 is an all-ones vector
and ◦ indicates an entrywise operation. Using this matrix we can build the
diﬀusion distance-weighted adjacency matrix of the network:
W (τ ) = A ◦ Σ (τ ) = Σ (τ ) ◦ A.

(11)

The shortest diﬀusion path between two nodes is then the shortest weighted
path in W (τ ). Let us consider each of the terms forming the definition of the
time-fractional diﬀusion distance and apply the limit of the very small −tα .
That is,
lim f (τ L)vv = lim

Therefore, lim Dvw (τ ) = 2. Consequently, lim W (τ ) = 2A, which immediately

implies that the time-fractional shortest diﬀusion path is identical to the shortest
(topological) one in the limit of very small τ = −tα .

Network of proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2

The proteins of SARS CoV-2 and their interactions with human proteins were
determined experimentally by Gordon et al. (14 ). Gysi et al. (15 ) constructed
an interaction network of all 239 human proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2. In
this network the nodes represent human proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2 and
two nodes are connected if the corresponding proteins have been determined to
interact with each other. Obviously, this network of proteins targeted by SARS
CoV-2 is a subgraph of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of humans.
One of the surprising findings of Gysi et al. (15 ) is the fact that this subgraph

is not formed by proteins randomly distributed across the human PPI, but
they form a main cluster of 208 proteins and a few small isolated components.
Hereafter, we will always consider this connected component of human proteins
targeted by SARS CoV-2. This network is formed by 193 proteins which are
significantly expressed in the lungs. Gysi et al. (15 ) reported a protein as being
significantly expressed in the lungs if its GTEx median value is larger than 5.
GTEx (36 ) is a database containing the median gene expression from RNA-seq
in diﬀerent tissues. The other 15 proteins are mainly expressed in other tissues.
However, in reporting here the tissues were proteins are mainly expressed we
use the information reported in The Human Protein Atlas (37 ) were we use
information not only from GTEx but also from HPA (see details at the Human
Protein Atlas webpage) and FANTOM5 (38 ) datasets.

Results
Global characteristics of the fractional diﬀusion

The PPI network of human proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2 is very sparse,
having 360 edges, i.e., its edge density is 0.0167, 30% of nodes have degree
(number of connections per protein) equal to one and the maximum degree of
a protein is 14. The second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix of this
network is very small, i.e., µ2 = 0.0647. Therefore, the rate of convergence to
the steady state of the diﬀusion processes taking place on this PPI are very
slow. We start by analyzing the eﬀects of the fractional coeﬃcient α on these
diﬀusive dynamics. We use the normal diﬀusion α = 1 as the reference system.
To analyze the eﬀects of changing α over the diﬀusive dynamics on the PPI
network we consider the solution of the TFD equation for processes starting at a
protein with a large degree, i.e., PRKACA, degree 14, and a protein with a low
degree, i.e., MRPS5, degree 3. That is, the initial condition vector consists of a
vector having one at the entry corresponding to either PRKACA or MRPS5 ans
zeroes elsewhere. In Fig. 1 we display the changes of the probability with the
shortest path distance from the protein where the process starts. This distance
corresponds to the number of steps that the perturbation needs to traverse
to visit other proteins. For α = 1.0 the shape of the curves in Fig. 1 are
the characteristic ones for the Gaussian decay of the probability with distance.
However, for α < 1 we observe that such decay diﬀers from that typical shape
showing a faster initial decay followed by a slower one. In order to observe this
eﬀect in a better way we zoomed the region of distances from 2 to 4 (see 1 (b)
and (d)). As can be seen for distances below 3 the curve for α = 1.0 is on top of
those for α < 1 indicating a slower decay of the probability. After this distance,
there is an inversion and the normal diﬀusion occurs at much faster rate than
the other two for the longer distances. This is a characteristic signature of
subdiﬀusive processes, which starts at much faster rates than a normal diﬀusive
process and then continue at much slower rates. Therefore, here we observe
that the subdiﬀusive dynamics are much faster at earlier times of the process,
which is when the perturbation occurs to close nearest neighbors to the initial

point of perturbation.
To further investigate these characteristic eﬀects of the subdiﬀusive dynamics
we study the time evolution of a perturbation occurring at a given protein and
its propagation across the whole PPI network. In Fig. 2 we illustrate these
results for α = 1.0 (a), α = 0.75 (a), α = 0.5 (c). As can be seen in the
main plots of this Figure the rate of convergence of the processes to the steady
state is much faster in the normal diﬀusion (a) than in the subdiﬀusive one (b)
and (c). However, at very earlier times (see insets in Fig. 2) there is a shock
wave increase of the perturbation at a set of nodes. Such kind of shock waves
have been previously analyzed in other contexts as a way of propagating eﬀects
across PPI networks (17 ). The remarkable finding here is however the fact that
such shock wave occurs at much earlier times in the subdiﬀusive regimes than
at the normal diﬀusion. That is, while for α = 1.0 these perturbations occur
at t ≈ 0.1 − 0.3, for α = 0.75 they occur at t ≈ 0.0 − 0.2, and for α = 0.5 at
t ≈ 0.0 − 0.1. Seeing this phenomenon in the light of what we have observed in
the previous paragraph is not strange due to the observation that such processes
go at much faster rate at earlier times, and at short distances, than the normal
diﬀusion. In fact, this is a consequence of the existence of a positive scalar T
for which Eα,1 (−γtα ) decreases faster than exp (−γt) for t ∈ (0, T ) for γ ∈ R+
and α ∈ R+ (see Theorem 4.1 in (32 )). Hereafter, we will consider the value
of α = 0.75 for our experiments due to the fact that it reveals a subdiﬀusive
regime, but the shoch waves observed before are not occurring in an almost
instantaneous way like when α = 0.5 , which would be diﬃcult from a biological
perspective.
The previous results put us in a crossroad. First, the subdiﬀusive processes
which are expected due to the crowded nature of the intra-cellular space, are
very slow for carrying out cellular processes at a significant rate in cells. However, the perturbation shocks occurring at earlier times of these processes are
significantly faster than in normal diﬀusion. To sort out these diﬃculties we
propose a switching back and restart subdiﬀusive process occurring in the PPI
network. That is, a subdiﬀusive process starts at a give protein, which is directly
perturbed by a protein of SARS CoV-2. It produces a shock wave increase of
the perturbation in close neighbors of that proteins. Then, a second subdiﬀusive
process starts at these newly perturbed proteins, which will perturb their nearest neighbors. The process is repeated until the whole PPI network is perturbed.
This kind of “switch and restart processes” have been proposed for engineering consensus protocols in multiagent systems (40 ) as a way to accelerate the
algorithms using subdiﬀusive regimes.

3.2

Diﬀusion from SARS CoV-2 Spike protein

The so-called Spike protein (S-protein) of the SARS CoV-2 interacts with only
two proteins in the human hosts, namely ZDHHC5 and GOLGA7. The first
protein, ZDHHC5, is not in the main connected component of the PPI network
of SARS CoV-2 targets. Therefore, we will consider here how a perturbation
produced by the interaction of the virus S-protein with GOLGA7 is propagated

through the whole PPI network of SARS CoV-2 targets. GOLGA7 has degree
one in this network and its diﬀusion is mainly to close neighbors, namely to
proteins separated by 2-3 edges. When starting the diﬀusion process at the
protein GOLGA7 the main increase in the probability of perturbing another
protein is reached for protein GOLGA3, which increases its probability up to
0.15 at t = 0.2, followed by PRKAR2A, with a small increase in its probability, 0.0081. Then, the process switch and restarts at GOLGA3, which mainly
triggers the probability of the protein PRKAR2A–a major hub of the network.
Once we start the process at PRKAR2A, practically the whole network is perturbed with probabilities larger than 0.1 for 19 proteins apart from GOLGA3.
These proteins are, in decreasing order of their probability of being perturbed:
AKAP8, PRKAR2B, CEP350, MIB1, CDK5RAP2, CEP135, AKAP9, CEP250,
PCNT, CEP43, PDE4DIP, PRKACA, TUB6CP3, TUB6CP2, CEP68, CLIP4,
CNTRL, PLEKHA5, and NINL. Notice that the number of proteins perturbed
is significantly larger than the degree of the activator, indicating that not only
nearest neighbors are activated.
An important criterion for revealing the important role of the protein PRKAR2A
as a main propagator in the network of proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2 is
its average diﬀusion path length. This is the average number of steps that a
diﬀusive process starting at this protein needs to perturb all the proteins in the
network. We have calculated this number to be 3.6250, which is only slightly
larger than the average (topological) path length, which is 3.5673. That is, in
least than 4 steps the whole network of proteins is activated by a diﬀusive process starting at PRKAR2A. Also remarkable, the average shortest diﬀusive path
length is almost identical to the shortest (topological) one. This means that this
protein mainly uses shortest (topological) paths in perturbing other proteins in
the PPI. In other words, it is highly eﬃcient in conducting such perturbations.
We will analyze this characteristics of the PPI of human proteins targeted by
SARS CoV-2 in a further section of this work.
At this time almost any protein in the PPI network is already perturbed.
Therefore we can switch and restart the subdiﬀusion from practically any protein at the PPI network. We then investigate which are the proteins with the
higher capacity of activating other proteins which are involved in human diseases. Here we use the database SiGeNet (39 ), which is one of the largest
publicly available collections of genes and variants associated to human diseases. We identified 38 proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2 for which there are
“definitive” or “strong” evidence of being involved in a human disease or syndrome (see Supplementary Table 1). These proteins participate in 70 diﬀerent
human diseases or syndromes as given in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3. We
performed an analysis in which a diﬀusive process starts at any protein of the
network and we calculated the average probability that all the proteins involved
in human diseases are then perturbed. For instance, for a subdiﬀusive process
starting at the protein ARF6 we summed the probabilities that the 38 proteins
involved in diseases are perturbed at an early time of the process t = 0.2. Then,
we obtain a global perturbation probability of 0.874. By repeating this process
for every protein as an initiator we obtained the top disease activators. We have

found that none of the 20 top activators is involved itself in any of the human
diseases or syndromes considered here. They are, however, proteins which are
important not because of their direct involvement in diseases or syndromes but
because they propagate perturbations in a very eﬀective way to those directly
involved in such diseases/syndromes. Among the top activators we have found:
ARF6, ECSIT, RETREG3, STOM, HDAC2, EXOSC5, THTPA, among others
shown in Fig. 4, where we illustrate the PPI network of the proteins targeted
by SARS CoV-2 remarking the top 20 disease activators.

3.3

Diﬀusion from the lungs to other organs

We now consider how a perturbation produced by SARS CoV-2 on a protein
mainly expressed in the lungs can be propagated to proteins mainly located in
other tissues (see Supplementary Table 4) by a subdiﬀusive process. That is,
we start the subdiﬀusive process by perturbing a given protein which is mainly
expressed in the lungs. Then, we observe the evolution of the perturbation at
every of the proteins mainly expressed in other tissues. We repeat this process
for all the 193 proteins mainly expressed in the lungs. In every case we record
those proteins outside the lungs which are perturbed at very early times of the
subdiﬀusive process. For instance, in Fig. 3 we illustrate one example in which
the initiator is the protein GOLGA2, which triggers a shock wave on proteins
RBM41, TL5 and PKP2, that are expressed mainly outside the lungs. We
consider such perturbations only if they occur at t < 1.
Not every one of the proteins expressed outside the lungs is triggered by such
shock waves at very early time of the diﬀusion. For instance, proteins MARK1
and SLC27A2are perturbed in very slow processes, and do not produce the
characteristics high peaks in the probability at very short times. On the other
hand, there are proteins expressed outside the lungs which are triggered by more
than one protein from the lungs. The case of GOLGA2 is an example of a protein
triggered by 3 ones in the lungs. In Table 1 we list some of the proteins expressed
mainly in tissues outside the lungs which are heavily perturbed by proteins in the
lungs. The complete list of the perturbing proteins is given in the Supplementary
Table 5. We give three indicators of the importance of the perturbation of these
proteins. They are: Act., which is the number of proteins in the lungs that
activate each of them; ptot , which is the sum of the probabilities of finding
the diﬀusive particle at this protein for diﬀusive processes that have started
in the their activators; tmean , which is the average time required by activators
to perturb the corresponding protein. For instance, PKP2 is perturbed by 21
proteins in the lungs, which indicates that this protein, mainly expressed in
the heart muscle, has a large chance of being perturbed by diﬀusive processes
starting in proteins mainly located at the lungs. Protein PRIM2 is activated
by 5 proteins in the lungs, but if all these proteins were acting at the same
time, the probability that PRIM2 is perturbed will be very high, ptot ≈ 0.536.
Finally, protein TLE5 is perturbed by 13 proteins in the lungs, which needs as
average tmean ≈ 0.24 to perturb TLE5. These proteins do not form a connected

between them is 5.286 with a maximum shortest subdiﬀusion path of 10. As
average they are almost equidistant from the rest of the proteins in the network
as among themselves. That is, the average shortest subdiﬀusion path between
these proteins expressed outside the lungs and the rest of the proteins in the
network is 5.106. Therefore, these proteins can be reached from other proteins
outside the lungs in no more than 6 steps in subdiﬀusive processes like the ones
considered here.

Subdiﬀusion paths

Finally we study here how the diﬀusive process determines the paths that the
perturbation follows when diﬀusing from a protein to another not directly connected to it. The most eﬃcient way of propagating a perturbation between the
nodes of a network is through the shortest (topological) paths that connect them.
The problem for a (sub)diﬀusive perturbation propagating between the nodes of
a network is that it does not have complete information about the topology of
the network as to know its shortest (topological) paths. The network formed by
the proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2 is very sparse and this indeed facilitates
that the perturbations occurs by following the shortest (topological) paths most
of the time. Think for instance in a tree, which has the lowest possible edge
density among all connected networks. In this case, the perturbation will always
use the shortest (topological) paths connecting pairs of nodes. However, in the
case of the PPI network studied here a normal diﬀusive process, i.e., α = 1, not
always uses the shortest (topological) paths. In this case, there are 1294 pairs
of proteins for which the diﬀusive particle uses a shortest diﬀusive path which
is one edge longer than the corresponding shortest (topological) path. This represents 6.11% of all total pairs of proteins that are interconnected by a path
in the PPI network of proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2. However, when we
have a subdiﬀusive process, i.e., α = 0.75, this number is reduced to 437, which
represents only 2.06% of all pairs of proteins. Therefore, the subdiﬀusion process studied here through the PPI network of proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2
has an eﬃciency of 97.9% relative to a process that always uses the shortest
(topological) paths in hopping between proteins. In Fig. 5 we illustrate the frequency with which proteins not in the shortest (topological) paths are perturbed
as a consequence that they are in the shortest subdiﬀusive paths between other
proteins. For instance, the following is a shortest diﬀusive path between the
two endpoints: RHOA-PRKACA-PRKAR2A-CEP43-RAB7A-ATP6AP1. The
corresponding shortest (topological) path is: RHOA-MARK2-AP2M1-RAB7AATP6AP1, which is one edge smaller. The proteins PRKACA, PRKAR2A and
CEP43 are those in the diﬀusive path which are not in the topological one.
Repeating this selection process for all the diﬀusive paths that diﬀers from the
topological ones we obtained the results illustrated in Fig. 5. As can be seen
there are 36 proteins visited by the shortest diﬀusive paths which are not visited
by the corresponding topological ones. The average degree of these proteins is
7.28 and there is only a small positive trend between the degree of the proteins
and the frequency with which they appear in these paths, e.g., the Pearson

Discussion

We have presented a methodology that allow the study of diﬀusive processes
in (PPI) networks varying from normal to subdiﬀusive regimes. Here we have
studied the particular case in which the time-fractional diﬀusion equation produces a subdiﬀusive regime, with the use of α = 3/4 in the network of human
proteins targeted by SARS CoV-2. A characteristic feature of this PPI network is that the second smallest eigenvalue is very small, i.e., µ2 = 0.0647.
As this eigenvalue determines the rate of convergence to the steady state, the
subdiﬀusive process converges very slowly to that state. What it has been surprising is that even in these conditions of very small convergence to the steady
state, there is a very early increase of the probability in those proteins closely
connected to the initiator of the diﬀusive process. That is, in a subdiﬀusive
process on a network, the time at which a perturbation is transmitted from the
initiator to any of its nearest neighbors occurs at an earlier time than for the
normal diﬀusion. This is a consequence of the fact that Eα,1 (−γtα ) decreases
very fast at small values of tα , which implies that the perturbation occurring
at a protein i at t = 0 is transmitted almost instantaneously to the proteins
closely connected to i. This eﬀect may be responsible for the explanation about
why subdiﬀusive processes, which are so globally slow, can carry out cellular
processes at a significant rate in cells. We have considered here a mechanism
consisting in switching and restarting several times during the global cellular
process. For instance, a subdiﬀusive process starting at the protein i perturbs
its nearest neighbors at very early times, among which we can find the protein
j. Then, a new subdiﬀusive process can be restarted again at the node j, and
so on.
One of the important findings of using the current model for the study of the
PIN of proteins aﬀected by SARS CoV-2 is the identification of those proteins
which are expressed outside the lungs that can be more eﬃciently perturbed
by those expressed in the lungs (see 1). For instance, the protein with the
largest number of activators, PKP2, appears mainly in the heart muscle. It has
been observed that the elevation of cardiac biomarkers is a prominent feature of
COVID-19, which in general is associated with a worse prognosis (41 ). Myocardial damage and heart failure are responsible for 40% of death in the Wuhan
cohort (see references in (41 )). Although the exact mechanism involving the
heart injury is not known the hypothesis of direct myocardial infection by SARS
CoV-2 is a possibility, which act along or in combination with the increased cardiac stress due to respiratory failure and hypoxemia, and or with indirect injury
from the systemic inflammatory response (41 , 42 , 43 , 44 ). As can be seen in
n Table 1 testis is the tissue where several of the proteins targeted by SARS
CoV-2 are mainly expressed, e.g., CEP43, TLE5, PRIM2, MIPOL1, REEP6,
HOOK1, CENPF, TRIM59, and MARK1. Currently there is not conclusive
evidence about testis damage by SARS CoV-2 (45 , 46 , 47 , 48 ). However, the

previous SARS CoV that appeared in 2003 and which shares 82% of proteins
with the current one, produced testis damage and spermatogenesis, and it was
concluded that orchitis was a complication of that previous SARS disease (45 ).
We also detect a few proteins mainly expressed in diﬀerent brain tissues, such
as CEP135, PRIM2, TRIM59, and MARK1. The implication of SARS CoV-2
and cerebrovascular diseases has been reported, including neurological manifestations as well as cerebrovascular disease, such as ischemic stroke, cerebral
venous thrombosis, and cerebral hemorrhage (49 , 50 , 51 ).
Kidney damage in SARS CoV-2 patients has been reported (52 , 53 , 54 ),
which includes signs of kidney dysfunctions, proteinuria, hematuria, increased
levels of blood urea nitrogen, and increased levels of serum creatinine. As much
as 25% of acute kidney injury has been reported in clinical setting of SARS CoV2 patients. One of the potential mechanisms for kidney damage is the organ
crosstalk (52 ), as can be the mechanism of diﬀusion from proteins in the lungs
to proteins in the urinary tract and kidney proposed here. A very interesting
observation from Table 1 is the existence of several proteins expressed mainly
in the thymus and T-cells, such as: TLE5, RETREG3, RBM41, CENPF, and
TRIM59. It has been reported that many of the patients aﬀected by SARS CoV2 in Wuhan displayed significant decrease of T-cells (55 ). Thymus is an organ
which displays a progressive decline with age with reduction of the order of 3-5%
a year until approximately 30-40 years of age and of about 1% per year after that
age. Consequently, it was proposed that the role of thymus should be taken into
account in order to explain why COVID-19 appears to be so mild in children
(55 ). The protein TLE5 is also expressed significantly in the lymph nodes. It
was found by Feng et al. (56 ) that SARS CoV-2 induces lymph follicle depletion,
splenic nodule atrophy, histiocyte hyperplasia and lymphocyte reductions. The
proteins HOOK1 and MIPOL1 are significantly expressed in the pituitary gland.
There has been some evidence and concerns that COVID-19 may also damage
the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis has been expressed by Pal (57 ), which
may be connected with the participation of the before mentioned proteins.
Another surprising finding of the current work is the elevated number of
subdiﬀusive shortest paths that coincide with the shortest (topological) paths
connecting pairs of proteins in the PPI of human proteins targeted by SARS
CoV-2. This means that the eﬃciency of the diﬀusive paths connecting pairs of
nodes in this PPI is almost 98% in relation to a hypothetical process which uses
the shortest (topological) paths in propagating perturbations between pairs of
proteins. The 437 shortest diﬀusive paths reported here contain one more edge
than the corresponding shortest (topological) paths. The proteins appearing in
these paths would never be visited in the paths connecting two other proteins
if only the shortest (topological) paths were used. What it is interesting is to
note that 6 out of the 15 proteins which are mainly expressed outside the lungs
are among the ones “crossed” by these paths. They are: TLE5 (thymus, lymph
node, testis), PKP2 (heart muscle), CEP135 (skeletal muscle, heart muscle,
cerebral cortex, cerebellum), CEP43 (testis), RBM41 (pancreas, T-cells, testis,
retina) and RETREG3 (prostate, thymus). This means that the perturbation
of these proteins occurs not only through the diﬀusion from other proteins in

the lungs directly to them, but also through some “accidental” diﬀusive paths
between pairs of proteins which are both located in the lungs.
All in all, the use of time-fractional diﬀusive models to study the propagation of perturbations on PPI networks seems a very promising approach. The
model is not only biologically sounded but it also allows us to discover interesting hidden patterns of the interactions between proteins and the propagation of
perturbations among them. In the case of the PIN of human proteins targeted
by SARS CoV-2 our current finding may help to understand potential molecular mechanisms for the multi-organs and systemic failures occurring in many
patients.

Tab. 1: Multi-organ propagation of perturbations. Protein mainly expressed outside the lungs which are significantly perturbed during diffusive processes started at other proteins expressed in the lungs. Act.,
is the number of lungs proteins activators; ptot , is the sum of the probabilities of finding the diﬀusive particle at this protein; tmean , is the
average time of activation (see text for explanations). The tissues of
main expression are selected among the ones with the highest Consensus Normalized eXpression (NX) levels by combining the data from the
three transcriptomics datasets (HPA, GTEx and FANTOM5) using the
internal normalization pipeline (37 ).

Supplementary Information

Supplementary Note 1
We first prove that the solution of the FTD equation is given by x (t) =
Eα,1 (−tα L) x0 , where Eα,1 (M ) is the Mittag-Leﬄer matrix function of M . We
−1
use the
[ spectral
] decomposition of the network Laplacian L = U ΛU , where
⃗1 · · · ψ
⃗n and Λ = diag (µr ). Then we can write
U= ψ
Dtα x (t) = −U ΛU −1 x (t) .

(14)

Let us define y (t) = U −1 x (t), such that Dtα x (t) = −U Λy (t) and we have
U −1 Dtα x (t) = −Λy (t)
Dtα y (t) = −Λy (t) .

(15)

As Λ is a diagonal matrix we can write
Dtα yi (t) = −µi yi (t) ,

(16)

yi (t) = Eα,1 (−tα µi ) yi (0) .

(17)

which has the solution

We can replace yi (t) = U −1 xi (t) to have
U −1 xi (t) = Eα,1 (−tα µi ) U −1 xi (0)
xi (t) = U Eα,1 (−tα µi ) U −1 xi (0) ,

(18)

which finally gives the result in matrix-vector when written for all the nodes,
x (t) = Eα,1 (−tα L) x0 .

(19)

Supplementary Note 2
In this Note we prove that the function Dvw = f (τ L)vv +f (τ L)ww −2f (τ L)vw ,
where f (τ L) = Eα,1 (−tα L) is a Euclidean distance between the corresponding
pair of nodes in the network. The matrix function f (τ L) can be written as
T
f (τ L) = U f (τ Λ) U −1 . Let φ
⃗ u = [ψ1,u , ψ2,u , · · · , ψn,u ] . Then,
T

Dvw = (⃗
φv − φ
⃗ w ) f (τ Λ) (⃗
φv − φ
⃗ w ).
Therefore, because f (τ L) is positive defined we can write

= ∥⃗xv (τ ) − ⃗xw (τ )∥ ,
where ⃗xv (τ ) = f 1/2 (τ Λ) φ
⃗ v . Consequently, Dvw is a square Euclidean distance between v and w. In this sense the vector ⃗xv (τ ) = f 1/2 (τ Λ) φ
⃗ v is
the position vector of the node v in the diﬀusion Euclidean space. Because
E1,1 (−tα L) = exp (−tα L) we have that Dvw generalizes the diﬀusion distance
studied by Coifman and Lafon, which is the particular case when α = 1.
