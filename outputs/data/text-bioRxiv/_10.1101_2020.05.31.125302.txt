Abstract
Widely-available LC-MS instruments and methods allow users to acquire
glycoproteomics data. Complex glycans, however, add a dimension of complexity to
the data analysis workflow.

In a sense, complex glycans are post-translationally

modified post-translational modifications, reflecting a series of biosynthetic reactions
in the secretory pathway that are spatially and temporally regulated. One problem is
that complex glycan is micro-heterogeneous, multiplying the complexity of the
proteome. Another is that glycopeptide glycans undergo dissociation during tandem
MS that must be considered for tandem MS interpretation algorithms and quantitative
tools. Fortunately, there are a number of algorithmic tools available for analysis of
glycoproteomics LC-MS data. We summarize the principles for glycopeptide data

Glycopeptide LC-MS algorithms

Introduction
The analysis of glycopeptides from glycoprotein digests using liquid chromatographymass spectrometry (LC-MS) is well established [1-9]. As with many protein posttranslational modifications, the depth and sensitivity of glycopeptide analysis is highest
when an enrichment step is used [5, 6, 10-22]. Glycopeptide LC-MS methods provide
maximal dynamic range but require specialized processing steps (Figure 1) to account
for glycopeptide heterogeneity and glycosidic bond dissociation [23, 24]. In this review,
we summarize bioinformatics methods for processing glycopeptide LC-MS data.

Glycopeptide deconvolution
In proteomics, in order to assign the neutral mass of a molecule, it is necessary to
convert the raw data from the m/z space to the neutral mass space. For unmodified
peptides, the elemental composition is approximated using an average amino acid
(averagine) to allow estimation of the protein composition [25]. For glycopeptides, it is
necessary to adjust the averagine value to include glycosylation. Tryptic glycopeptides
tend to be observed over a larger m/z and charge state range (2+ to 9+) than typical
tryptic peptides (2+ to 4+). In addition, as shown in Figure 2, glycosylation skews the
isotopic distribution relative

to

unmodified

peptides. Therefore,

deconvolution algorithms are required for glycoproteomics data.

spectral data [30] used the pParse algorithm [31], developed by the same group, for
deconvolution of precursor and product ions. The GlycoPAT glycoproteomics analysis
toolbox [32, 33] deconvolves precursor ions but not product ions. The glyXtool(MS)
open-source pipeline for semi-automated analysis of glycopeptide mass spectral data
[34] uses an OpenMS Feature Finder [35] to calculate precursor ion masses. The
GlycReSoft suite of tools for glycomics and glycoproteomics uses an LC-scale
deisotoping and charge state deconvolution algorithm for precursor and product ions
[36] .

Glycopeptide database searching
Glycopeptide identification algorithms use peptide-centric, glycan-centric or complete
approaches. The peptide-centric method focusses on identifying the peptide backbone
sequence, may use peptide + Y ions, but do not control for the false discovery rate of
the glycan [37]. By contrast, glycan-centric methods [38, 39] identify the attached
glycan but do not use peptide backbone dissociation to assign the peptide sequence.
Combined methods [40-42] employ a single score that includes both peptide and
glycan components and controls the total uncertainty but not the uncertainty of the
separate components. Complete methods [43-45] control the uncertainty of glycan
and peptide components separately and combined. Some methods use oxonium ions
to constrain the range of glycopeptide glycans in a manner that complements use of
peptide + Y ions for assigning glycan composition. These approaches assume that
there is no ion co-isolation of more than one glycopeptide ion.
A glycoproteomics database search engine includes functions for (i) search space
construction, (ii) mass spectrum pre-processing, (iii) a scoring model that evaluates

the match between a spectrum and a search space structure, and (iv) a model that
evaluates the identification uncertainty for estimation of false discovery rates of
glycopeptide sequence matches. The search space uses an input protein list to
calculate proteolytic peptides with a list of constant and variable modification rules that
include glycosylation. The input protein list may be derived from a FASTA file, an
annotated protein sequence format, or an exported proteomics search mzIdentML file.
The advantage to using a well-annotated proteome is that the extent of combinatorial
expansion of the search space due to inclusion of glycosylation is minimized. There is
a degree of subjectivity regarding the makeup of the glycan search space used to
construct theoretical glycopeptides. The best practice is to use a measured glycome
for this purpose, but this is not always practical. While glycan databases such as
GlyTouCan [46] can be used, care must be taken to use the subset of glycans
appropriate for the biological system in question. Approaches for estimating glycan
search spaces have been described using biosynthetic simulation [47, 48], manual
curation [43, 49, 50], and combinatorial expansion [41, 51]. The SweetNET algorithm
used a small combinatorial glycan list to extrapolate the set of N-glycans, O-glycans,
and GAG linker saccharides using a spectral network to infer monosaccharide
gain/loss in networks of spectra [26].
Glycopeptide tandem MS scoring models depend on the dissociation method and
glycopeptide size, meaning that there is no one optimal model that applies to all
tandem MS data. For collisional dissociation, collision energy strongly influences the
appearance and informational value of glycopeptide tandem mass spectra. As shown
in Figure 3, glycopeptide tandem mass spectra contain low m/z oxonium ions that act
as signatures for glycosylation and high m/z ions from loss of monosaccharide units
from the precursor ion. Peptide backbone product ions are typically observed only for

elevated collision energies. Therefore, use of stepped collision energy has become
popular for glycopeptide studies [49]. While electron activated dissociation methods
generally favor peptide backbone dissociation over glycosidic bond dissociation, the
degree to which vibrational excitation is observed is technique and instrument
dependent [52-57].
As with proteomics of unmodified peptides, empirical models are used to estimate false
discovery rate (FDR) for glycopeptides. As in proteomics, glycopeptide data are
searched using target decoy analysis [58-60] whereby targets and decoys compete for
spectral matching.

Some published methods for glycopeptides use structural

properties to optimize model performance [30, 33, 44] or employ hierarchical filters [26,
37, 47, 49] to optimize results. For HCD, stepped collision energies most consistently
produce peptide+Y ions and peptide bn and yn ions that characterize the glycopeptide
glycan and peptide backbone independently [49, 61, 62].
Glycoproteomics of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S)
Whole pathogenic organism vaccines work well against viruses the life cycles of
which do not require evasion from the host immune system, including measles, polio,
and small pox [63]. By contrast, viruses that have life cycles that depend on the
ability to evade the host immune system and have evolved mechanisms that result in
suboptimal antibody responses. Immune evasion by molecular mimicry and glycan
shielding has been observed and characterized for spike proteins of viruses including
HIV-1 envelop protein [64], influenza hemagglutinin [65], Lassa virus glycoprotein
complex [66], and corona virus S protein [67].
Glycosylation of the HIV envelope trimer corresponds to about half of its total mass
[68]. The dense glycan shield limits the extent of biosynthetic processing, resulting in

primarily high mannose N-glycans that are thought to interfere with proteolytic
processing of envelope peptides for presentation to the major histocompatibility
complex [69, 70]. Although studies have identified broadly neutralizing antibodies
that recognize the HIV envelope glycan shield, it has not been possible to induces
such antibodies in response to vaccine challenge [64]. By contrast, glycosylation of
influenza A virus hemagglutinin reflects a balance of immune evasion versus receptor
binding. If hemagglutinin glycosylation becomes too dense, it interferes with receptor
bniding and/or membrane fusion [71-73].
Four respiratory coronaviruses cause mild, cold-like, symptoms in humans. While
most adults have antibodies against these coronaviruses, they have circulated in the
human population for centuries [74]. The severe acute respiratory syndrome corona
virus (SARS-CoV) zoonotic outbreak in humans was contained within three months
after its discovery in 2002. The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)
coronavirus has spread zoonotically to humans repeatedly but has so far had limited
human-to-human spread [75]. By contrast, the SARS-CoV-2 virus jumped from
animals to humans in 2019 and caused a global pandemic with incalculable damage
to human culture world-wide.
Glycosylation of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is of interest for development of antiviral
strategies that target the virus-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor
recognition [76]. The S protein is composed of the amino-terminal receptor binding
S1 and carboxy-terminal S2 membrane fusion subunit [77]. Proteolytic cleavage
between S1 and S2 is required for receptor binding and membrane fusion [74].
Because antibodies against S1 receptor binding domain have the potential to

neutralize the virus, there is interest in using S protein constituents as vaccine
candidates [74, 78].
The use of glycan masking and molecular mimicry has been described for human
respiratory coronavirus HCoV-NL63 and other coronaviruses [77, 79]. The
coronavirus glycan shield was observed to be less dense than that of HIV envelop
protein. The most pathogenic coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS and SARS-CoV-2)
appear to have S protein trimers able to adopt open and closed conformations [80].
S Protein glycosylation is therefore an important factor to characterize from the point
of view of its influences on virus-receptor recognition.
We chose to analyze a published LC-MS data set on SARS-CoV-2 recombinant S
protein [81] using our publicly available, open-source GlycReSoft program [36]. We
show how any biomedical scientist with access to a Windows desktop computer can
query publicly available data for S protein site-specific glycosylation.
Experimental
The site-specific glycosylation of recombinant S protein expressed in human cells
was characterized using glycoproteomics liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry
[81]. The authors expressed the pre-fusion S domain with two proline substitutions
were used to stabilize the trimer [82]. A “GSAS” substitution at the furin cleavage site
and a C-terminal trimerization motif were used to facilitate maintenance of quaternary
architecture during glycan processing [83]. They digested separate samples using
trypsin, chymotrypsin and alpha-lytic protease, respectively, in order to map
glycosylation at all 22 sequons. Size fractionated, reduced, and alkylated S protein
was digested with protease and the resulting peptides analyzed using 75 µm internal
diameter, 75 cm length reversed phase LC-MS with a 275 min linear gradient. The

scan range was 400-1600 and HCD collision energy set to 50%. The instrument was
set for top-N data dependent acquisition. A single raw LC-MS data file for each
proteolytic enzyme was posted publicly to the MassIVE Database [84].
Glycopeptides were assigned using the GlycReSoft graphical user interface [36]
available at http://www.bumc.bu.edu/msr/glycresoft/. Raw files were converted to
mzML format using ProteoWizard MSConvert [85] and deconvoluted/deisotoped
using the GlycReSoft preprocessing algorithm. A glycan search space was
constructed by combining an N-glycan biosynthesis simulation combined with up to
one sulfate per glycan composition. A glycopeptide search space was built for each
protease using the corresponding mzIdentML or FASTA file and the glycomics
search space. Glycopeptides were identified using 0-1 ammonium adducts, with a
precursor mass error tolerance of 10 ppm, a product mass error tolerance of 10 ppm.
The complete GlycReSoft HTML reports are included as Supplemental Files.
Results
Total ion chromatograms for the tryptic, chymotryptic and alpha lytic protease digests
are shown in Figure 4. The use of a long LC gradient combined with a single HCD
collision energy value of 50% maximized the number of glycopeptides that were
selected for tandem MS. The proteomics search of the tryptic digest of S protein
identified a total of 888 proteins, the top 20 most abundant of which are shown in
Figure 5. The S protein was approximately 10-fold more abundant than the next
most abundant protein. In order to determine the effect of host proteins on the ability
to assign glycopeptides, we compared the GlycReSoft results for a search space
constructed using all proteins identified versus that using only SARS-CoV-2 S
protein. The results showed that a similar number of glycopeptides were mapped

using the complete proteome versus that for the S protein only proteome. This
indicated that host proteins did not interfere significantly with the identification of S
protein glycosites. We next compared results using no ion adduction versus 0-1
ammonium adduct and 0-1 sodium adduct together. Because the number of
glycopeptides identified was similar in both cases, the results demonstrated that
there was a low degree ion adduction in the LC-MS runs.
While the glycopeptide tandem mass spectrum shown in Figure 3 was acquired using
stepped collision energy, the S protein tandem MS data were acquired using HCD
set at 50%. Under these conditions, glycopeptides were extensively fragmented and
the abundances of peptide + Yn ions was very low, skewing tandem MS scores to the
lower range (see for example Figure 6B). The peptide sequence is identified
unambiguously but the lack of peptide+Yn ions limited glycan characterization to
intact mass and oxonium ions, leaving core structure unknown. As a balancing factor,
it is possible to dissociate more precursor ions when a single collision energy is
specified that with stepped collision energy.
We processed LC-MS runs acquired for three proteolytic digests, trypsin,
chymotrypsin and alpha lytic protease. The trypsin and alpha-lytic protease search
parameters were set to specify one site of glycosylation peptide using a desktop
computer using 5 processors. The chymotryptic digest was first considered using
only one site of glycosylation per peptide, but the set of identified glycans from that
search were used to re-generate the search space allowing up to two sites of
glycosylation per peptide for the final reported results, searched on with a shared
high performance computing cluster utilizing 16 processors. The glycoforms identified
for each glycopeptide are shown Figure 6-Figure 19. The results shown correspond

to the enzyme digest that produced the highest glycopeptide abundances for a given
glycosite. Overall, the abundances of high mannose, hybrid, and complex N-glycan
compositions is consistent with those in the original publication [81].
N-Glycan sulfation is a topic of interest for influenza A virus because this modification
influences viral replication, receptor binding, antigenicity and interactions with lectins
of the innate immune system [86, 87]. In influenza A virus, the virus neuraminidase
enzyme removes all or nearly all of the sialic acid residues from hemagglutinin Nglycans. Sulfation has been identified on C-3 of Gal and C-6 of GlcNAc residues of
N-glycans as a biosynthetic event taking place in the trans-Golgi network [88].
Researchers investigated several influenza vaccine preparations and found sulfation
at several N-glycan sites for H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N9 and influenza B [89].
In contrast to influenza hemagglutinin, both sialylated and asialo N-glycans of S
protein are abundant. We therefore included sulfation as a modification to the Nglycan search space we used for our analyses. We found position 74 to carry
abundant sulfated tri-antennary and tetra-antennary N-glycans (Figure 6A). A total of
144 glycan compositions were identified at this position from the chymotryptic digest.
An example annotated glycopeptide tandem mass spectrum is shown in Figure 6B.
As shown in Figure 6C, 6 of the 30 most abundant glycan compositions at site 74 are
sulfated. These abundant sulfated glycans range in composition Fuc0-2 Hex3-4
HexNAc5-6 NeuAc0-2, indicating that sulfation is likely placed on a non-reducing end
HexNAc residue. Sulfation was also detected at trace levels for sites 1074 (Figure
17), 1098 (Figure 18) and 1194 (Figure 19).
As expected, each glycosite reflects a distribution of glycan compositions, consistent
with the existence of populations of mature S glycoprotein molecules differing by

glycosylation. As shown in Figure 6-Figure 19, glycans at sites 234, 709, 717, 801
are occupied primarily by high mannose N-glycans with minimal processing to
complex type compositions. Note that sites 709 and 717 were identified in the same
chymotryptic peptide (Figure 15) and we assumed one glycan per site. Glycans at
sites 122, 165, 801, and 1074 display an abundant Hex2HexNAc5 composition,
indicating processing by mannosidases, along with hybrid, complex biantennary and
complex triantennary compositions, indicating that the S protein population
undergoes a range from low to high degree of Golgi-mediated biosynthetic
processing at these sites. Sites 74, 149, 282, 331, 343, 657, 1098, and 1194
contain extensively processed bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary compositions, consistent
with high degree of accessibility to biosynthetic enzymes at these sites.

Conclusion
GlycReSoft is an open-source, publicly available software program that can used to
analyze glycoproteomics LC-MS data. The program allows the user to specify glycan
modifications including sulfation. We show an example of the use of GlycReSoft to
assign SARS-CoV-2 S protein glycosylation from a published data set in which we
identify sulfated N-glycans not identified in the original manuscript.
