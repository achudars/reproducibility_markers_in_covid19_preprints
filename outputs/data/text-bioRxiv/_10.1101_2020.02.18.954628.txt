Abstract
The outbreak of 2019-nCoV pneumonia (COVID-19) in the city of Wuhan, China has
resulted in more than 70,000 laboratory confirmed cases, and recent studies showed
that 2019-nCoV (SARS-CoV-2) could be of bat origin but involve other potential
intermediate hosts. In this study, we assembled the genomes of coronaviruses
identified in sick pangolins. The molecular and phylogenetic analyses showed that
pangolin Coronaviruses (pangolin-CoV) are genetically related to both the
2019-nCoV and bat Coronaviruses but do not support the 2019-nCoV arose directly
from the pangolin-CoV. Our study also suggested that pangolin be natural host of
Betacoronavirus, with a potential to infect humans. Large surveillance of
coronaviruses in pangolins could improve our understanding of the spectrum of
coronaviruses in pangolins. Conservation of wildlife and limits of the exposures of
humans to wildlife will be important to minimize the spillover risks of coronaviruses
from wild animals to humans.

Introduction
In December 2019, there was an outbreak of pneumonia with an unknown cause
in Wuhan, Hubei province in China, with an epidemiological link to the Huanan
Seafood Wholesale Market, which is a live animal and seafood market. Clinical
presentations of this disease greatly resembled viral pneumonia. Through deep
sequencing on the lower respiratory tract samples of patients, a novel coronavirus
named the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified [1]. Within less than 2
months, the viruses have spread to all provinces across China and 23 additional
countries. As of February 19, 2020, the epidemic has resulted in 72,532 laboratory
confirmed cases, 1,872 of which were fatal. With nearly three weeks of locking down
Wuhan (and followed by many other cities across China), the toll of new cases and
deaths are still rising.
To effectively control the diseases and prevent new spillovers, it is critical to
identify the animal origin of this newly emerging coronavirus. In this wet market of
Wuhan, high viral loads were reported in the environmental samples. However,
variety of animals, including some wildlife, were sold on this market, and the number
and species were very dynamics. It remains unclear which animal initiated the first
infections.
Coronaviruses cause respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections and are
genetically classified into four major genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus,
Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. The former two genera primarily infect
mammals, whereas the latter two predominantly infect birds [2]. In addition to the
2019-nCoV, Betacoronavirus caused the 2003 SARS (severe acute respiratory

syndrome) outbreaks and the 2012 MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome)
outbreaks in humans [3, 4]. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are of bat origin, but
palm civets were shown to be an intermediate host for SARS-CoV [5] and dromedary
camels for MERS-CoV [6].
Approximate 30-thousand-base genome of coronavirus codes up to 11 proteins,
and the surface glycoprotein S protein binds to receptors on the host cell, initiating
virus infection. Different coronaviruses can use distinct host receptors due to
structural variations in the receptor binding domains of the virus S protein.
SARS-CoV uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as one of the main
receptors [7] with CD209L as an alternative receptor [8], whereas MERS-CoV uses
dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) as the primary receptor.
Computational modeling analyses suggested that, similar to SARS-CoV, the
2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as the receptor [9].
Not soon after the release of the 2019-nCoV genome, a scientist released a full
genome of a coronavirus, Bat-CoV-RaTG13, from bat (Rhinolophus sinicus), which is
colonized in Yunan province, nearly 2,000 km away from Wuhan. Bat-CoV-RaTG13
was 96% identical at the whole genome level to the 2019-nCoV, suggesting the
2019-nCoV, could be of bat origin [10]. However, with rare direct contacts between
such bats and humans, similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it seems to be more
likely that the spillover of 2019-nCoV to humans from another intermediate host
rather than directly from bats.
The goal of this study is to determine the genetic relationship between a

coronavirus from two groups of sick pangolins and the 2019-nCoV and to assess
whether pangolins could be a potential intermediate host for the 2019-nCoV.

Results
In March of 2019, we detected Betacoronavirus in three animals from two sets of
smuggling Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) (n=26) intercepts by Guangdong
customs [11]. All three animals suffered from serious respiratory diseases and failed
to be rescued by the Guangdong Wildlife Rescue Center [11] (Table S2). Through
metagenomic sequencing and de novo assembling, we recovered 38 contigs ranging
from 380 to 3,377 nucleotides, and the nucleotide sequence identities among the
contigs from these three samples were 99.54%. Thus, we pooled sequences from three
samples and assembled the draft genome of this pangolin origin coronavirus, so called
pangolin-CoV-2020 (Accession No.: GWHABKW00000000), which was
approximately 29,380 nucleotides, with approximately 84% coverage of the virus
genome (Figure 1a).
Strikingly, genomic analyses suggested the pangolin-CoV-2020 has a high
identity with both 2019-nCoV and Bat-CoV-RaTG13, the proposed origin of the
2019-nCoV [10] (Figure 1b; Figure 1c). The nucleotide sequence identity between
pangolin-CoV-2020 and 2019-nCoV was 90.23% whereas the protein sequence
identities for individual proteins can be up to 100% (Table S3; Table S4). The
nucleotide sequence between pangolin-CoV-2020 and Bat-CoV-RaTG13 was 90.15%
whereas that for the corresponding regions between 2019-nCoV and

Bat-CoV-RaTG13 was 96.12% (Table 1).
The nucleotide sequence identities of the surface glycoprotein Spike (S) protein
genes between pangolin-CoV-2020 and 2019-nCoV was 82.21%, and the
Bat-CoV-RaTG13 and 2019-nCoV shared the highest sequence identity of 92.59%
(Table 1). There was a low similarity of 72.63% between the S genes of
pangolin-CoV-2020 and SARS-CoV. Nucleotide sequence analyses suggested the S
gene was relatively more genetic diverse in the S1 region than the S2 region (Figure
2a). Furthermore, the S proteins of pangolin-CoV-2020 and 2019-nCoV had a
sequence identity of 89.78% (Table 2), sharing a very conserved receptor binding
motif (RBM) (Figure S1), which is more conserved than in Bat-CoV-RaTG13. These
results support that pangolin-CoV-2020 and 2019-nCoV, and SARS-CoV could all
share the same receptor ACE2. The presence of highly identical RBMs in
pangolin-CoV-2020 and 2019-nCoV means that this motif was likely already present
in the virus before jumping to humans. However, it is interesting that both
pangolin-CoV-2020 and Bat-CoV-RaTG13 lack a S1/S2 cleavage site (~680-690 aa)
whereas 2019-nCoV possess (Figure S1).
Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the S genes of pangolin-CoV-2020,
2019-nCoV and three bat origin coronaviruses (Bat-CoV-RaTG13,
Bat-CoV-CVZXC21, and Bat-Cov-CVZC45) were genetically more similar to each
other than other viruses in the same family (Figure 2b). The S gene of
Bat-CoV-RaTG13 was genetically closer to each other than pangolin-CoV-2020,
Bat-CoV-CVZXC21, and Bat-Cov-CVZC45. Similar tree topologies were observed

for the RdRp gene and other genes (Figure 3a-d; Figure S2a-h). At the whole genomic
level, the 2019-nCoV is also genetically closer to Bat-CoV-RaTG13 than
pangolin-CoV-2020 (Figure 1c).

Discussion
In this study, we assembled the genomes of coronaviruses identified in sick
pangolins and our results showed that a pangolin coronavirus (pangolin-CoV-2020) is
genetically associated with both 2019-nCoV and a group of bat coronaviruses. There
is a high sequence similarity between pangolin-CoV-2020 and 2019-nCoV. However,
phylogenetic analyses did not support the 2019-nCoV arose directly from the
pangolin-CoV-2020.
It is of interest that the genomic sequences for coronaviruses detected from two
batches of pangolins intercepted by two different customs at different dates were all
be associated with bat coronaviruses. The reads from the third pangolin acquired in
July of 2019 were relatively less abundant than the two from the first two pangolin
samples acquired in March of 2019. Although we are unclear whether these two
batches of smuggling and exotic pangolins were from the same origin, our results
indicated that pangolin be a natural host for Betacoronaviruses, which could be
enzootic in pangolins. All three exotic pangolins detected with Betacoronaviruses in
this study were very sick with serious respiratory diseases and failed to be rescued.
However, these pangolins were very stressful in the transportation freight when being
intercepted by the customs. It is unclear whether this coronavirusis a common virus

flora in the respiratory tracts of pangolins. Nevertheless, the pathogenesis of this
coronavirus to pangolin remains to be studied.
Compared to the genomic sequence of pangolin-CoV-2020 we assembled in this
study, phylogenetic trees suggested that a bat origin coronavirus (i.e.,
Bat-CoV-RaTG13) was more genetically close to the 2019-nCoV at both individual
gene and genomic sequence level. Interestingly, the cleavage site between S1 and S2
at the 2019-nCoV had multiple insertions (i.e. PRRA), compared to that of
Bat-CoV-RaTG13 and pangolin-CoV-2020, which were similar. Thus, although it is
clear that 2019-nCoV is of bat origin, it is likely another intermediate host could be
involved in emergence of the 2019-nCoV.
The S protein of coronaviruses bind to host receptors via receptor-binding
domains (RBDs), and plays an essential role in initiating virus infection and
determines host tropism [2]. A prior study suggested that the 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV,
and Bat-CoV-RaTG13 had similar RBDs, suggested all of them use the same receptor
ACE2 [9]. Our analyses showed that pangolin-CoV-2020 had a very conserved RBD
to these three viruses rather than MERS-CoV, suggesting that pangolin-CoV is very
likely to use ACE2 as its receptor. On the other hand, ACE2 receptor is present in
pangolins with a high sequence conservation with those in the gene homolog in
humans. However, the zoonosis of this pangolin-CoV-2020 remains unclear.
The host range of animal origin coronaviruses was promiscuous [12]. It is critical
to determine the natural reservoir and the host range of coronaviruses, especially their
potential of causing zoonosis. In the last two decades, besides the 2019-nCoV, SARS

and MERS caused serious outbreaks in humans, lead to thousands of deaths [3, 4, 13,
14]. Although all of three zoonotic coronaviruses were shown to be of bat origin, they
seemed to use different intermediate hosts. For example, farmed palm civets were
suggested to be an intermediate host for SARS to be spilled over to humans although
the details on how to link bat and farmed palm civets are unclear [15, 16, 17]. Most
recently, dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia were shown to harbor three different
coronavirus species, including a dominant MERS-CoV lineage that was responsible
for the outbreaks in the Middle East and South Korea during 2015 [18]. Although this
present study does not support pangolins would be an intermediate host for the
emergence of the 2019-nCoV, our results do not prevent the possibility that other
CoVs could be circulating in pangolins. Thus, large surveillance of coronaviruses in
the pangolins could improve our understanding the spectrum of coronaviruses in the
pangolins. Conservation of wildlife and limits of the exposures of humans to wildlife
will be important to minimize the spillover risks coronaviruses from wild animals to
humans.
In summary, this study suggested pangolins be a natural host of Betacoronavirus,
with an unknown potential to infect humans. However, our data do not support the
2019-nCoV evolved directly from the pangolin-CoV.

Materials and Methods
Data selection. During our routine wildlife rescue efforts, one of the goals was to

identify pathogens causing wildlife diseases. In 2019, we were involved in two events
of pangolin rescues, one involved with 21 smuggling pangolins in March and the
second with 6 smuggling pangolins in July. From those pangolins failed to be rescued,
we collected samples from different tissues and subjected for metagenomic analyses.
Through viral metagenomics analyses of lower respiratory tract samples from these
pangolins, we detected coronavirus in three individual animals [11]. Two of these
animals were from the first batch of Malayan pangolins intercepted by Meizhou,
Yangjiang, and Jiangmen customs, and the third one was from the second batch in a
freight being transported from Qingyuan to Heyuan. The RNA samples from these
three individuals were subjected to deep sequencing. To determine the read abundance
of coronaviruses in each sample, we mapped clean reads without ribosomes and host
sequences to an in-house virus reference data separated from the GenBank
non-redundant nucleotide database.

Genomic assembly and sequence analyses. After examining the high similarity
among the samples from three animals, to maximize the coverage of the virus genome,
clean reads from three animals were pooled together and de novo assembled using
MEGAHIT v1.2.9 [19]. The assembled contigs were used as references for mapping
those the rest unmapped reads using Salmon v0.14.1 [20], and multiple rounds were
implemented to maximize the mapping (Table S2).
A total of 38 contigs were identified to be highly similar to the 2019-nCoV
genome (accession MN908947.3) using BLASTn and tBLASTx. GapFiller v1.10 and

SSPACE v3.0 were used to fill gaps and draft pangolin-CoV-2020 genome was
constructed with ABACAS v1.3.1 (http://abacas.sourceforge.net/) [21, 22, 23].
Multiple sequence alignments were conducted using CLUSTAL Ov1.2.4 [24].
Simplot analyses were conducted with SimPlot v3.5.1 to determine the sequence
similarity among 2019-nCoV (MN908947.3), pangolin-CoV-2020, Bat-CoV-RaTG13
(MN996532.1), and SARS-CoV (AY395003.1) at both the genomic sequence level
and at individual gene level [25]. Sequence identity was calculated utilizing
p-diatance in MEGA v10.1.7 [26].

Phylogenetic analyses. We downloaded 44 full-length genome sequences of
coronaviruses isolated from different hosts from the public database (Table S1).
Phylogenetic analyses were performed based on their whole genome sequences,
encoding ORFs of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp gene), the receptor
binding protein spike protein (S gene), small envelope protein (E gene), as well as all
other gene sequences were conducted utilizing Mrbayes [27] with 50,000,000
generations and the 25% of the generations as burnin. Best models were determined
by jModeltest v2.1.7 [28]. Then, all the trees were visualized and exported as vector
diagrams with FigTree v1.4.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).
