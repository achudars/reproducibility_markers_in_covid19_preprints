Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 has intricate mechanisms for initiating infection, immune evasion/suppression, and
replication, which depend on the structure and dynamics of its constituent proteins. Many protein
structures have been solved, but far less is known about their relevant conformational changes.
To address this challenge, over a million citizen scientists banded together through the
Folding@home distributed computing project to create the first exascale computer and simulate
an unprecedented 0.1 seconds of the viral proteome. Our simulations capture dramatic opening
of the apo Spike complex, far beyond that seen experimentally, which explains and successfully
predicts the existence of ‘cryptic’ epitopes. Different Spike homologues modulate the
probabilities of open versus closed structures, balancing receptor binding and immune evasion.
We also observe dramatic conformational changes across the proteome, which reveal over 50
‘cryptic’ pockets that expand targeting options for the design of antivirals. All data and models
are freely available online, providing a quantitative structural atlas.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that
poses an imminent threat to global human health and socioeconomic stability.1 With estimates of
the basic reproduction number at ~3-4 and a case fatality rate for coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) ranging from ~0.1-12% (high temporal variation), SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 has
spread quickly and currently endangers the global population.2-6 As of September 12th, 2020,
there have been over 29 million confirmed cases and over 925,000 fatalities, globally.
Quarantines and social distancing are effective at slowing the rate of transmission; however, they
cause significant social and economic disruption. Taken together, it is crucial that we find
immediate therapeutic interventions.
A structural understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins could accelerate the discovery of
new therapeutics by enabling the use of rational design.7 Towards this end, the structural biology
community has made heroic efforts to rapidly build models of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and the
complexes they form. However, it is well established that a protein’s function is dictated by the
full range of conformations it can access; many of which remain hidden to experimental
methods. Mapping these conformations for SARS-CoV-2 proteins will provide a clearer picture
of how they enable the virus to perform diverse functions, such as infecting cells, evading a
host’s immune system, and replicating. Such maps may also present new therapeutic
opportunities, such as ‘cryptic’ pockets that are absent in experimental snapshots but provide
novel targets for drug discovery.
Molecular dynamics simulations have the ability to capture the full ensemble of
structures a protein adopts but require significant computational resources. Such simulations
capture an all-atom representation of the range of motions a protein undergoes. Modern datasets
often consist of a few microseconds of simulation for a single protein, with a few noteworthy
examples reaching millisecond timescales.8,9 However, many important processes occur on
slower timescales. Moreover, simulating every protein that is relevant to SARS-CoV-2 for
biologically relevant timescales would require compute resources on an unprecedented scale.
To overcome this challenge, more than a million citizen scientists from around the world
have donated their computer resources to simulate SARS-CoV-2 proteins. This massive
collaboration was enabled by the Folding@home distributed computing platform, which has
crossed the exascale computing barrier and is now the world’s largest supercomputer. Using this
resource, we constructed quantitative maps of the structural ensembles of over two dozen
proteins and complexes that pertain to SARS-CoV-2. Together, we have run an unprecedented
0.1 s of simulation. Our data uncover the mechanisms of conformational changes that are
essential for SARS-CoV-2’s replication cycle and reveal a multitude of new therapeutic
opportunities. The data are supported by a variety of experimental observations and are being
made publicly available (https://covid.molssi.org/ and https://osf.io/fs2yv/) in accordance with
open science principles to accelerate the discovery of new therapeutics.10,11
To the Exascale and beyond!
Folding@home (http://foldingathome.org) is a community of citizen scientists, researchers, and
tech organizations dedicated to applying their collective computational and intellectual resources
to understand the role of proteins’ dynamics in their function and dysfunction, and to aid in the
design of new proteins and therapeutics. The project was founded in the year 2000 with the
intent of understanding how proteins fold.12 At the time, simulating the folding of even small
proteins could easily take thousands of years on a single computer. To overcome this challenge,

researchers developed algorithms for dividing these seemingly intractable problems into smaller
simulations that could be performed completely independently of one another. They then created
the Folding@home project to enable anyone with a computer and an internet connection to
volunteer to run these small chunks of simulation, called “work units”.
Over the years, the applications of Folding@home have been generalized to address
many aspects of protein dynamics, and the algorithms have developed significantly. The
Folding@home Consortium now involves eight laboratories around the world studying various
aspects of disease from cancer to antimicrobial resistance to membrane protein dysfunction
diseases (https://foldingathome.org/about/the-foldinghome-consortium/). The project has
provided insight into diverse topics, ranging from signaling mechanisms.13-15 to the connection
between phenotype and genotype.16-18 Translational applications have included new means to
combat antimicrobial resistance, Ebola virus, and SFTS virus.19-21

response to COVID-19. The cumulative number of users is shown in blue and COVID-19 cases are shown in
orange. B) Global distribution of Folding@home users. Each yellow dot represents a unique IP address contributing

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Folding@home quickly pivoted to focus on
SARS-CoV-2 and the host factors it interacts with. Many people found the opportunity to take
action at a time when they were otherwise feeling helpless alluring. In less than three months, the
project grew from ~30,000 active devices to over a million devices around the globe (Fig. 1A
and 1B).
Estimating the aggregate compute power of Folding@home is non-trivial due to factors
like hardware heterogeneity, measures to maintain volunteers’ anonymity, and the fact that

volunteers can turn their machines on and off at-will. Furthermore, volunteers’ machines only
communicate with the Folding@home servers at the beginning and end of a work unit, with the
intervening time taking anywhere from tens of minutes to a few days depending on the
volunteer’s hardware and the protein to simulate. Therefore, we chose to estimate the
performance by counting the number of GPUs and CPUs that participated in Folding@home
during a three-day window and making a conservative assumption about the computational
performance of each device (see Methods for details). We note that a larger time window has
been used on our website for historical reasons.
Given the above, we conservatively estimate the peak performance of Folding@home hit
1.01 exaFLOPS. This performance was achieved at a point when ~280,000 GPUs and 4.8 million
CPU cores were performing simulations. As explained in the Methods, to be conservative about
our claims, we assume that each GPU/CPU has worse performance than a card released before
2015. For reference, the aggregate 1 exaFLOPS performance we report for Folding@home is 5fold greater than the peak performance of the world’s fastest traditional supercomputer, called
Summit (Fig. 1C). It is also more than the top 100 supercomputers combined. Prior to
Folding@home, the first exascale supercomputer was not scheduled to come online until the end
of 2021.
Extensive spike opening reveals cryptic epitopes
The Spike complex (S) is a prominent vaccine target that is known to undergo substantial
conformational changes as part of its function.22-24 Structurally, S is composed of three
interlocking proteins, with each chain having a cleavage site separating an S1 and S2 fragment. S
resides on the virion surface, where it waits to engage with an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) receptor on a host cell to trigger infection.25,26 The fact that S is exposed on the virion
surface makes it an appealing vaccine target. However, it has a number of effective defense
strategies. First, S is decorated extensively with glycans that aid in immune evasion by shielding
potential antigens.27,28 S also uses a conformational masking strategy, wherein it predominantly
adopts a closed conformation (often called the down state) that buries the receptor-binding
domains (RBDs) to evade immune surveillance mechanisms. To engage with ACE2, S must
somehow expose the conserved binding interface of the RBDs. Characterizing the full range of S
opening is important for understanding pathogenesis and could provide insights into novel
therapeutic options.
To capture S opening, we employed our goal-oriented adaptive sampling algorithm,
FAST, in conjunction with Folding@home. The FAST method iterates between running a batch
of simulations, building a map called a Markov state model (MSM), ranking the conformational
states of this MSM based on how likely starting a new simulation from that state is to yield
useful data, and starting a new batch of simulations from the top ranked states.29,30 The ranking
function is designed to balance between favoring structures with a desired geometric feature (in
this case opening of S) and broad exploration of conformational space. By balancing explorationexploitation tradeoffs, FAST often captures conformational changes with orders of magnitude
less simulation time than alternative methods. Broadly distributed structures from our FAST
simulations were then used as starting points for extensive Folding@home simulations, totaling
over 1 ms of data for SARS-CoV-2 S, enabling us to obtain a statistically sound final model.

cryptic epitopes that are buried in the up and down cryoEM structures. The fraction of residues within different

epitopes that are exposed to a 0.5 nm radius probe for the down structure (blue), up structure (yellow), the ensemble
average from our simulations (green), and the maximum value we observe in our simulations (red). Epitopes are
determined as the residues that contact the specified antibody, and are clustered by their binding location on the
RBD.36

Our SARS-CoV-2 S protein simulations capture opening of S and substantial
conformational heterogeneity in the open state with full atomistic detail (Fig. 2). Capturing
opening of S is an impressive technical feat. Other large-scale simulations have provided
valuable insight into aspects of S, but were unable to capture this essential event for the initiation
of infection.28,31,32 We successfully captured this rare event for both glycosylated and
unglycosylated S and found that glycosylation slightly increases the population of the open state,
but is qualitatively very similar to the unglycosylated ensemble (Fig. S1). The closed state is
more probable than the open state, explaining the experimental observation that full-length S has
a lower affinity for ACE2 than an isolated RBD.40 Intriguingly, we find that opening occurs only
for a single RBD at a time, akin to the up state observed in cryoEM structures.33 Moreover, we
find that the scale of S opening is often substantially larger than has been observed in
experimental snapshots in the absence of binding partners (Fig. S2). The dramatic opening we
observe explains the observation that antibodies, and other therapeutics, can bind to regions of
the RBD that are deeply buried and seemingly inaccessible in existing experimental snapshots.3437
For example, the cryptic epitope for the antibody CR3022 is buried in up and down cryoEM
structures, but is clearly exposed in our conformational ensemble (Fig. 2C). Indeed, our
ensemble captures the exposure of many known epitopes, despite their occlusion in apo
experimental snapshots (Fig. 2D). Our models also provide a quantitative estimate of the
probability that different epitopes are exposed, is consistent with experimental measures of
dynamics, and can be used to determine the most suitable regions for the design of neutralizing
antibodies.
To understand the potential role of conformational masking in determining the lethality
and infectivity of different coronaviruses, we also simulated the opening of S proteins from two
related viruses: SARS-CoV-1 and HCoV-NL63. These viruses were selected because they also
bind the ACE2 receptor but are associated with varying mortality rates. SARS-CoV-1 caused an
outbreak in 2003 with a high case fatality rate but has not become a pandemic.38 NL63 was
discovered the following year and continues to spread around the globe, although it is
significantly less lethal than either SARS virus.39 We hypothesized that these phenotypic
differences may be partially explained by changes to the S conformational ensemble.
Specifically, we propose mutations or other perturbations can increase the S-ACE2 affinity by
increasing the probability that S adopts an open conformation or by increasing the affinity
between an exposed RBD and ACE2. In contrast, the affinity of S for ACE2 (or antibodies that
bind cryptic epitopes) can be reduced by stabilizing the closed state.
As expected, the three S complexes have very different propensities to adopt an open
state and bind ACE2. Structures from each ensemble were classified as competent to bind ACE2
if superimposing an ACE2-RBD structure on S did not result in any steric clashes between
ACE2 and the rest of the S complex. We find that SARS-CoV-1 has the highest population of
conformations that can bind to ACE2 without steric clashes, followed by SARS-CoV-2, while
opening of NL63 is sufficiently rare that we did not observe ACE2-binding competent
conformations in our simulations (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, S proteins that are more likely to adopt
structures that are competent to bind ACE2 are also more likely to adopt highly open structures
(Fig 2C).

Figure 3: Effects of glycan shielding and conformational masking on the accessibility of different parts of the
Spike to potential therapeutics. A) The probability that a residue is exposed to potential therapeutics, as
determined from our structural ensemble. Red indicates a high probability of being exposed and blue indicates a low
probability of being exposed. B) Exposure probabilities colored on the surface of the Spike protein. Exposed patches
are circled in orange. Red residues have a higher probability of being exposed, whereas blue residues have a lower
probability of being exposed. Green atoms denote glycans. C) Sequence conservation score colored onto the Spike
protein. A conserved patch on the protein is circled in orange. Red residues have higher conservation, whereas blue
residues have lower conservation. D) The difference in the probability that each residue is exposed between the
ACE2-binding competent conformations and the entire ensemble. Red residues have a higher probability of being
exposed upon opening, whereas blue residues have a lower probability of being exposed.

We also observe a number of interesting correlations between conformational masking,
lethality, and infectivity of different coronaviruses. First, more deadly coronaviruses have S
proteins with less conformational masking. Second, there is an inverse correlation between S
opening and the affinity of an isolated RBD for ACE2 (RBD-ACE2 affinities of ~35 nM, ~44
nM, and ~185 nM for HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-1, respectively).41,42
These observations suggest a tradeoff wherein greater conformational masking enables
immune evasion but requires a higher affinity between an exposed RBD and ACE2 to
successfully infect a host cell. We propose that the NL63 S complex is probably best at evading
immune detection but is not as infectious as the SARS viruses because strong conformational
masking reduces the overall affinity for ACE2. In contrast, the SARS-CoV-1 S complex adopts
open conformations more readily but is also more readily detected by immune surveillance
mechanisms. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 balances conformational masking and the RBD-ACE2
affinity in a manner that allows it to evade an immune response while maintaining its ability to
infect a host cell. Based on this model, we predict that mutations that increase the probability that
the SARS-CoV-2 S complex adopts open conformations may be more lethal but spread less
readily.
Our atomically detailed model of S can facilitate structure-based vaccine antigen design
through identification of regions minimally protected by conformational masking or the glycan
shield.43 To identify these potential epitopes, we calculated the probability that each residue in S
could be exposed to therapeutics (e.g. not shielded by a glycan or buried by conformational
masking), as shown in Fig. 3A. Visualizing these values on the protein reveals a few patches of
protein surface that are exposed through the glycan shielding (Fig. 3B). However, another
important factor when targeting an antigen is picking a region with a conserved sequence to yield
broader and longer lasting efficacy. Not surprisingly, many of the exposed regions do not have a
strongly conserved sequence. Promisingly, though, we do find a conserved area with a larger
degree of solvent exposure (Fig. 3C). This region was recently found to be an effective site for
neutralizing antibodies.44 Another possibility for antigen design is to exploit the opening motion.
A number of residues surrounding the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the RBD show an
increase in exposure by ~30% in ACE2 binding competent structures (Fig. 3C). Consistent with
immunoassays and cryoEM structures, these regions are hotspots for neutralizing antibody
binding.34,45,46
Cryptic pockets and functional dynamics are present throughout the proteome
Every protein in SARS-CoV-2 remains a potential drug target. So, to understand their role in
disease and help progress the design of antivirals, we unleashed the full power of Folding@home
to simulate dozens of systems related to pathogenesis. While we are interested in all aspects of a
proteins’ functional dynamics, expanding on the number of antiviral targets is of immediate

value. Towards this end, we seeded Folding@home simulations from our FAST-pockets
adaptive sampling to aid in the discovery of cryptic pockets. We briefly discuss two illustrative
examples, out of 36 datasets.
Nonstructural protein number 5 (NSP5, also named the main protease, 3CLpro, or as we
will refer to it, Mpro) is an essential protein in the lifecycle of coronaviruses, cleaving polyprotein
1a into functional proteins, and is a major target for the design of antivirals.47 It is highly
conserved between coronaviruses and shares 96% sequence identity with SARS-CoV-1 Mpro; it
cleaves polyprotein 1a at no fewer than 11 distinct sites, placing significant evolutionary
constraint on its active site. Mpro is only active as a dimer, however it exists in a monomer-dimer
equilibrium with estimates of its dissociation constant in the low μM range.48 Small molecules
targeting this protein to inhibit enzymatic activity, either by altering its active site or favoring the
inactive monomer state, would be promising broad-spectrum antiviral candidates.49
Our simulations reveal two novel cryptic pockets on Mpro that expand our current
therapeutic options. These are shown in Fig. 4A, which projects states from our MSM onto the
solvent exposure of residues that make up the pockets. The first cryptic pocket is an expansion of
NSP5’s catalytic site. We find that the loop bridging domains II and III is highly dynamic and
can fully undock from the rest of the protein. This motion may impact catalysis—i.e. by
sterically regulating substrate binding—and is similar to motions we have observed previously
for the enzyme β-lactamase.50 Owing to its location, a small molecule bound in this pocket is
likely to prevent catalysis by obstructing polypeptide association with catalytic residues. The
second pocket is a large opening between domains I/II and domain III. Located at the
dimerization interface, this pocket offers the possibility to find small molecules or peptides that
favor the inactive monomer state.
In addition to cryptic pockets, our data captures many potentially functionally relevant
motions within the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. We illustrate this with the SARS-CoV-2
nucleoprotein. The nucleoprotein is a multifunctional protein responsible for major lifecycle
events such as viral packaging, transcription, and physically linking RNA to the envelope.51,52 As
such, we expect the protein to accomplish these goals through a highly dynamic and rich
conformational ensemble, akin to context-dependent regulatory modules observed in Ebola virus
nucleoprotein.53,54 Investigating the RNA-binding domain, we observe both cryptic pockets and
an incredibly dynamic beta-hairpin, which hosts the RNA binding site, referred to as a “positive
finger” (Fig. 4C-D). Our observed conformational heterogeneity of the positive finger is
consistent with a structural ensemble determined using solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy.55 Our simulations also capture numerous states of the putative RNA
binding pose, where the positive finger curls up to form a cradle for RNA. These states can
provide a structural basis for the design of small molecules that would compete with RNA
binding, preventing viral assembly.

Mpro (monomeric) highlighting cryptic pockets near the active site (AS) and domain interface (DI). Conformational
states (black circles) are projected onto the solvent accessible surface areas (SASAs) of residues surrounding either
the active-site or dimerization interface. The starting structure for simulations (6Y2E) is shown as a red dot.
Representative structures are depicted with cartoon and transparent surface. Domains I and II are colored cyan and
domain III is colored gray. The loop of domain III, which covers the active-site residues and is seen to be highly
dynamic, is colored red. C-D) The conformational ensemble from our simulations of nucleoprotein is similar to the

simulations. Table 1 is a comprehensive list of the systems we have simulated. Systems span

and preventative treatments. To accelerate the discovery of new therapeutics and promote open

Discussion
The Folding@home community has created one of the largest computational resources in the
world to tackle a global threat. Over a million citizen scientists have pooled their computer
resources to help understand and combat COVID-19, generating more than 0.1 seconds of
simulation data. The unprecedented scale of these simulations has helped to characterize crucial
stages of infection. We find that Spike proteins have a strong trade-off between making ACE2
binding interfaces accessible to infiltrate cells and conformationally masking epitopes to subvert
immune responses. SARS-CoV-2 represents a more optimal tradeoff than related coronaviruses,
which may explain its success in spreading globally. Our simulations also provide an atomically
detailed roadmap for designing vaccines and antivirals. For example, we have made a
comprehensive atlas and repository of cryptic pockets hosted online to accelerate the
development of novel therapeutics. Many groups are already using our data, such as the COVID
Moonshot,59 an international collaboration between multiple computational and experimental
groups working to develop a patent-free inhibitor of the main protease.
Beyond SAR S-CoV-2, we expect this work to aid in a better understanding of the roles
of proteins in the coronaviridae family. Coronaviruses have been around for millennia, yet many
of their proteins are still poorly understood. Because climate change has made zoonotic
transmission events more commonplace, it is imperative that we continue to perform basic
research on these viruses to better protect us from future pandemics. For each protein system in
Table 1, an extraordinary amount of sampling has led to the generation of a quantitative map of
its conformational landscape. There is still much to learn about coronavirus function and these
conformational ensembles contain a wealth of information to pull from.
While we have aggressively targeted research on SARS-CoV-2, Folding@home is a
general platform for running molecular dynamics simulations at scale. Before the COVID-19
pandemic, Folding@home was already generating datasets that were orders of magnitude greater
than from conventional means. With our explosive growth, our compute power has increased
around 100-fold. Our work here highlights the incredible utility this compute power has to
rapidly understand health and disease, providing a rich source of structural data for accelerating
the design of therapeutics. With the continued support of the citizen scientists that have made
this work possible, we have the opportunity to make a profound impact on other global health
crises such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and antibiotic resistance.
Methods
System preparation
All simulations were prepared using Gromacs 2020.60 Initial structures were placed in a
dodecahedral box that extends 1.0 nm beyond the protein in any dimension. Systems were then
solvated and energy minimized with a steepest descents algorithm until the maximum force fell
below 100 kJ/mol/nm using a step size of 0.01 nm and a cutoff distance of 1.2 nm for the

neighbor list, Coulomb interactions, and van der Waals interactions. The AMBER03 force field
was used for all systems except Spike protein with glycans, which used CHARMM36.61,62 All
simulations were simulated with explicit TIP3P solvent.63
Systems were then equilibrated for 1.0 ns, where all bonds were constrained with the
LINCS algorithm and virtual sites were used to allow a 4 fs time step.64 Cutoffs of 1.1 nm were
used for the neighbor list with 0.9 for Coulomb and van der Waals interactions. The particle
mesh ewald method was employed for treatment of long-range interactions with a fourier
spacing of 0.12 nm. The Verlet cutoff scheme was used for the neighbor list. The stochastic
velocity rescaling (v-rescale) thermostat was used to hold the temperature at 300 K.65
Adaptive sampling simulations
The FAST algorithm was employed for each protein in Table 1 to enhance conformational
sampling and quickly explore dominant motions. The procedure for FAST simulations is as
follows: 1) run initial simulations, 2) build MSM, 3) rank states based on FAST ranking, 4)
restart simulations from the top ranked states, 5) repeat steps 2-4 until ranking is optimized. For
each system, MSMs were generated after each round of sampling using a k-centers clustering
algorithm based on the RMSD between select atoms. Clustering continued until the maximum
distance of a frame to a cluster center fell within a predefined cutoff. In addition to the FAST
ranking, a similarity penalty was added to promote conformational diversity in starting
structures, as has been described previously.66
FAST-distance simulations of all Spike proteins were run at 310 K on the Microsoft
Azure cloud computing platform. The FAST-distance ranking favored states with greater RBD
openings using a set of distances between atoms. Each round of sampling was performed with 22
independent simulations that were 40 ns in length (0.88 μs aggregate sampling per round), where
the number of rounds totaled 13 (11.44 μs), 22 (19.36 μs), and 17 (14.96 μs), for SARS-CoV-1,
SARS-CoV-2, and HCoV-NL63, respectively.
For all other proteins, FAST-pocket simulations were run at 300 K for 6 rounds, with 10
simulations per round, where each simulation was 40 ns in length (2.4 μs aggregate simulation).
The FAST-pocket ranking function favored restarting simulations from states with large pocket
openings. Pocket volumes were calculated using the LIGSITE algorithm.67
Folding@home simulations
For each adaptive sampling run, a conformationally diverse set of structures was selected to be
run on Folding@home. Structures came from the final k-centers clustering of adaptive sampling,
as is described above. Simulations were deployed using a simulation core based on either
GROMACS 5.0.4 or OpenMM 7.4.1.60,68
To estimate the performance of Folding@home, we make the conservative assumption
that each CPU core performs at 0.0127 TFLOPS and each GPU at 1.672 native TFLOPS (or 3.53
X86-equivalent TFLOPS), as explained in our long-standing performance estimate
(https://stats.foldingathome.org/os). For reference, a GTX 980 (which was released in 2014) can
achieve 5 native TFLOPS (or 10.56 X86-equivalent TFLOPS). An Intel Core i7 4770K (released
in 2013) can achieve 0.046 TFLOPS/core. We report x86-equivalent FLOPS.
Markov state models
A Markov state model is a network representation of a free energy landscape and is a key tool for
making sense of molecular dynamics simulations.69 All MSMs were built using our python

package, enspara.70 Each system was clustered with the combined FAST and Folding@home
datasets. In the case of Spike proteins, states were defined geometrically based on the RMSD
between backbone Cɑ coordinates. States were generated as the top 3000 centers from a k-centers
clustering algorithm. All other proteins were clustered based on the Euclidean distance between
the solvent accessible surface area of residues, as is described previously.50 Systems generated
either 2500, 5000, 7500, or 10000 cluster centers from a k-centers clustering algorithm. Select
systems were refined with 1-10 k-medoid sweeps. Transition probability matrices were produced
by counting transitions between states, adding a prior count of 1/𝑛$%&%'$ , and row-normalizing,
as is described previously.71 Equilibrium populations were calculated as the eigenvector of the
transition probability matrix with an eigenvalue of one.
Spike/ACE2 binding competency
To determine Spike protein binding competency to ACE2 the following structures of the RBD
bound to ACE2 were used: 3D0G, 6M0J, and 3KBH, for SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and
HCoV-NL63, respectively. The RBD of the bound complex was superimposed onto each RBD
for structures in our MSM. Steric clashes were then determined between backbone atoms on the
ACE2 molecule and the rest of the spike protein. If any of the structures had a superposition that
resulted in no clashes, it was deemed binding competent.
Cryptic pockets and solvent accessible surface area
For ease of detecting cryptic pockets and other functional motions, we employed our exposon
analysis method.50 This method correlates the solvent exposure between residues to find
concerted motions that tend to represent cryptic pocket openings. Solvent accessible surface area
calculations were computed using the Shrake-Rupley algorithm as implemented in the python
package MDTraj.72 For all proteins and complexes, a solvent probe radius of 0.28 nm was used,
which has been shown to produce a reasonable clustering and exposon map.50
Spike protein solvent accessible surface areas for SARS-CoV-2 were computed with
glycan chains modeled onto each cluster center. Multiple glycan rotamers were sampled for each
state and accessible surface areas for each residue were weighted based on MSM equilibrium
populations.
Sequence conservation
Sequence conservation of spike proteins was calculated using the Uniprot database.73 Sequences
between 30% - 90% were pulled and aligned with the Muscle algorithm.74 The entropy at each
position was calculated to quantify variability of amino acids. Conservation was defined as one
minus the entropy.

Figure S1: Distribution of SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD opening. The probability that the center of mass of an RBD

deviates from its position in the closed (or down) state for SARS-CoV-2 spike with glycans (gray) and without
glycans (black).

Figure S2: Simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike complex reveal the existence of an “open” state. For reference, three
Spike complex snapshots are shown: the “down” state (6VXX), the “up” state (6VSB), and an “open” state from our simulations.
Structures are depicted with a cartoon backbone, transparent surface for sidechains, and sticks for glycans. Each chain in the
complex has a unique color, orange, purple, or teal, and glycans are colored green.
