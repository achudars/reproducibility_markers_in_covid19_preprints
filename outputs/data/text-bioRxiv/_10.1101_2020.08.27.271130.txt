Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replicates throughout

51

human airways. The polarized human airway epithelium (HAE) cultured at an airway-liquid

52

interface (HAE-ALI) is an in vitro model mimicking the in vivo human mucociliary airway

53

epithelium and supports the replication of SARS-CoV-2. However, previous studies only

54

characterized short-period SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE. In this study, continuously monitoring

55

the SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE-ALI cultures for a long period of up to 51 days revealed that

56

SARS-CoV-2 infection was long lasting with recurrent replication peaks appearing between an

57

interval of approximately 7-10 days, which was consistent in all the tested HAE-ALI cultures

58

derived from 4 lung bronchi of independent donors. We also identified that SARS-CoV-2 does

59

not infect HAE from the basolateral side, and the dominant SARS-CoV-2 permissive epithelial

60

cells are ciliated cells and goblet cells, whereas virus replication in basal cells and club cells

61

was not detectable. Notably, virus infection immediately damaged the HAE, which is

62

demonstrated by dispersed Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression without clear tight junctions

63

and partial loss of cilia. Importantly, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 productive infection of HAE

64

requires a high viral load of 2.5 × 105 virions per cm2 of epithelium. Thus, our studies highlight

65

the importance of a high viral load and that epithelial renewal initiates and maintains a recurrent

66

infection of HAE with SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

76

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an acute respiratory tract infection that emerged

77

in late 2019, is caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

78

(SARS-CoV-2) 1-5. It is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, and belongs to

79

the genus Betacoronavirus of the family Coronaviridae 1-3, 6. The clinical syndrome of COVID-19

80

is characterized with a varying degree of severity, ranging from a mild upper respiratory illness 7

81

to severe interstitial pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a life-

82

threatening lung injury that allows fluid to leak into the lung 5, 8-10. Compared to ~34% fatality of

83

the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) and ~10% of the severe acute respiratory

84

syndrome (SARS) 11, COVID-19 has a lower fatality rate, ranging from 0.7% to 5.7% in the

85

United States 12, however, it spreads more efficiently than SARS and MERS 13, 14, making it

86

difficult to contain. COVID-19 has become a pandemic 15, which has led to over 24.5 million

87

confirmed cases and >834,000 fatalities worldwide as of August 27, 2020.

88

While SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA can be detected in nasal swabs, nasopharyngeal

89

aspirates, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids throughout the airways 1-3, 16, 17, how the virus

90

infects epithelial cells at different levels of the respiratory tree and the underlying pathogenesis

91

remain unclear. Thus, a comprehensive understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 replicates and

92

causes pathogenesis in its native host, the epithelial cells lining different levels of the airways, is

93

essential to devising therapeutic and prevention strategies to counteract COVID-19. Primary

94

human nasal, trachea, and bronchial epithelial cells can be cultured and differentiated at an air-

95

liquid interface (ALI), forming a pseudostratified mucociliary airway epithelium that is composed

96

of ciliated cells, goblet cells, club cells and basal cells with an arrangement closely reflective of

97

an in vivo cellular organization 18, 19. This in vitro model of human airway epithelium (HAE)

98

cultured at an ALI (HAE-ALI) closely recapitulates many important characteristics of respiratory

99

virus-host cell interactions seen in the infected upper and lower airways in vivo, and has been

100

used to study many human respiratory viruses 20-29, including SARS-CoV 30, 31. Primary HAE-ALI

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.27.271130; this version posted August 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

101

can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 32, 33 resulting in epithelial damage 34, and they can be used for

102

virus isolation 1, 16. Notably, differentiation at an ALI results in a drastic increase in expression

103

and the polar presentation of the viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 2, 35 on

104

the apical membrane 30, 31. Thus, the differentiation/polarization of the epithelial cells is an

105

optimal cell culture model to study SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.

106

In this study, we generated HAE-ALI cultures directly from primary bronchial epithelial

107

cells without propagation prior to differentiation at an ALI and we used these cultures to model

108

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies were carried out for a long period of up to 51 days and focused

109

on the viral replication kinetics, the dose dependency of viral infection, epithelial damage and

110

the permissive subpopulation of the epithelial cell types. The polar infection of SARS-CoV-2 in

111

HAE-ALI was confirmed. While SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected HAE-ALI through the apical

112

side at a viral load as low as a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.002 plaque forming units (pfu)

113

per cell, at an MOI lower than this threshold the viral replication was undetectable. Notably,

114

SARS-CoV-2 infection presented as an enduring infection in HAE-ALI with recurrent peaks of

115

virus released from the infected ciliated and goblet cells while the airway basal cells and club

116

cells are non-permissive.

117
118

Results

119

SARS-CoV-2 infection of human airway epithelia presents a long-lasting infection and

120

causes epithelial damage.

121

SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects human airway epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and

122

lung of COVID-19 patients 36, 37. SARS-CoV-2 infections in the in vitro model of well-

123

differentiated HAE-ALI or as organoids have been reported 34, 36, 38, 39. However, these studies

124

were focused on short-term virus replication and cytopathic effects as they were carried out in a

125

timeframe of less than one-week post-infection. Since airway epithelia capably repair,

126

regenerate, and remodel themselves 40, we hypothesized that a long-term monitoring of SARS-

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.27.271130; this version posted August 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

127

CoV-2 infection in HAE-ALI might reveal unknown important features that were missed in prior

128

studies.

129

To this end, we first chose two HAE-ALI cultures, B4-20 and B9-20 (HAE-ALIB4-20 and

130

HAE-ALIB9-20), which were respectively generated from primary bronchial epithelial cells freshly

131

isolated from two donors. The initial study was performed with the infection of SARS-CoV-2 at

132

an MOI of 2 pfu/cell. We collected the apical washes on a daily base for continued monitoring of

133

the virus replication through titration for infectious virions with plaque assay in Vero-E6 cells. We

134

also periodically performed confocal microscopy analysis of the infected HAE with

135

immunofluorescent assays. As expected, we observed rapid virus release from the infected

136

HAE-ALI cultures, which reached a peak of 9 × 105 pfu/ml at 2 days post-infection (dpi). The

137

apical virus release from HAE-ALIB4-20 remained at the peak for 3 days, then decreased to a

138

level less than 800 pfu/ml at 7 dpi (Fig. 1, B4-20). The infection of HAE-ALIB9-20 presented a

139

similar trend with the peak at 7.5 × 105 pfu/ml from 2-6 dpi, which dropped to 3 × 103 pfu/ml at 9

140

dpi (Fig. 1, B9-20). However, at later time points, continued study revealed a virus release

141

kinetics with at least two peaks during the course of 3 weeks from both infections. In the

142

infection of HAE-ALIB4-20, the virus release started to increase again from 8 dpi and reached a

143

peak of 7.6 × 105 pfu/ml at 12 dpi. The apical release of virus then dropped to 3 × 104 pfu/ml at

144

14 dpi, followed by another peak of 7 × 105 pfu/ml at 17 dpi. (Fig. 1, B4-20). Notably, while the

145

decrease of the virus released from the 1st peak of infected HAE-ALIB9-20 lagged behind that of

146

the infected HAE-ALIB4-20 by 2 days, it demonstrated the second peak at 11-13 dpi (Fig. 1, B9-

147

20), which contained viral shedding at 7.6 × 105 pfu/ml. We reasoned that this was due to the

148

donor variation, which affects the extent of differentiation and the ratio of the subpopulation of

149

epithelial cell types, but not the properties permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. To address this,

150

we infected the HAE-ALI B3-20, which was derived from another donor, with a 10-fold reduced

151

virus inoculum (MOI of 0.2 pfu/cell). We observed similar replication kinetics with two virus

152

release peaks (SFig. 1A). Of note, even though a reduced MOI was applied to HAE-ALI B3-20, we

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.27.271130; this version posted August 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

153

recorded a higher viral shedding in the 1st peak (4 × 106 pfu/ml) than that from HAE-ALIB4-20 and

154

HAE-ALIB9-20, while those in the 2nd peaks of the infections in the three cultures were

155

approximately at a similar level (5 × 105 pfu/ml). SARS-CoV-2 infection of HAE-ALIB3-20

156

significantly reduced the TEER values starting at 1 dpi (SFig. 1B), caused dispersed ZO-1

157

expression and loss the cilia (SFig. 1C&D), which will be further discussed below.

158

SARS-CoV2-infection in HAE-ALI was visualized by immunostaining for the expression

159

of viral nucleocapsid protein (NP) in the infected cells. The analyses revealed the relative

160

increases of NP-positive (NP+) cells, aligned roughly with the apical virus release kinetics (Fig.

161

2 and SFig. 2, NP). Of note, infected HAE-ALI showed a poor staining of zonula occludens

162

(ZO)-1, which started at 1 dpi and remained throughout the infection, indicating rapid epithelial

163

damage caused by the infection as the tight junctions of the epithelia were destroyed (Fig. 2A,

164

SFig. 1C and SFig. 2A, ZO-1). The Infected HAE-ALI also showed a partial loss of the cilia,

165

indicated by immunostaining with anti-β-tubulin IV, which also started at 1 dpi and remained at a

166

similar level throughout the course of infection (Fig. 2B, SFig. 1D, and SFig. 2B, β-tubulin IV).

167

To observe the infected epithelia in a greater detail, we performed Z-stacked imaging of the

168

infected HAE-ALIB9-20 at 15 dpi. The images showed a percentage of ~10% NP+ cells, broken

169

tight junctions (Fig. 3A, SARS-CoV2/ZO-1), and an approximate loss of half of the cilia (Fig. 3B,

170

SARS-CoV2/Tubulin), compared with the mock-infected HAE (Fig. 3B, Mock). Of note, most of

171

the NP+ cells remained β-tubulin IV stained, suggesting that ciliated cells represent the major

172

cell type in HAE permissive to SARS-CoV-2. We also noticed that there were less cells present

173

in the area where NP1 staining were positive, compared to the mock infection, as determined by

174

the number of the nuclei in the imaged area, indicating cell loss (death) of the infected epithelia

175

(Fig. 3, DAPI, SARS-CoV-2 vs Mock).

176
177

Taken all together, these results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection of HAE-ALI
represents a long-lasting process with multiple peaks of virus infections (apical virus release

178

and NP-expressing cells), and that the infection deteriorates two hallmarks of the airway

179

epithelia: the tight junctions and ciliary expression.

180
181
182

SARS-CoV-2 infection of HAE presents multiple peaks and requires a high viral load.
To further examine the recurrent peaks of virus release from the infections and the

183

barrier dysfunction of SARS-CoV-2 infected HAE, we performed a longer monitoring period of

184

31 days for the infection of HAE-ALIB4-20 (Fig. 4&5) at an MOI from 0.2 to 0.00002 and 51 days

185

for HAE-ALIL209 that was polarized on the large MilliCell™ insert at an MOI 0f 0.2 (SFig. 3&4). At

186

an MOI of 0.2 pfu/cell, the infection of HAE-ALIB4-20 clearly displayed three peaks at 4, 15, and

187

31 dpi (Fig. 4A), and the infection of HAE-ALIL209 displayed 5-6 peaks at 3, 14, 23, 31, and 41

188

dpi (SFig. 3A). There were significant numbers of infected cells (NP+) at 31 and 51 dpi in HAE-

189

ALIB4-20 and HAE-ALIL209, respectively (Fig. 5, MOI=0.2 and SFig. 4). Again, the barrier function

190

of the infected HAE-ALI was diminished, as determined by the TEER measurement, begun at 1

191

dpi (Fig. 4B&D and SFig. 3B), as well as by the dispersed ZO-1 staining (Fig. 5A, MOI=0.2,

192

and SFig. 4A). We also consistently observed drastic loss of the cilia (Fig. 5B, MOI=0.2, and

193

SFig. 4B).

194

Viral shedding to the culture medium in the basolateral chamber across the supportive

195

membrane was also continuously monitored in the experiments. The infectious virions in the

196

medium were detectable in the early time points after the infection was initiated, but at a level of

197

two to three orders of magnitude less than that in the apical washes (Fig. 4A, SFig. 1A, and

198

SFig. 3A), suggesting the that the progeny of the SARS-CoV-2 are predominately released from

199

the apical membrane of the infected HAE. We concluded that the trace of detectable viruses in

200

the basolateral medium must come from the leakage of the apically secreted viruses across the

201

supportive semipermeable membrane due to epithelial damage caused from SARS-CoV-2

202

infection. Interestingly, no infectious virions were found in the basal medium when the peaks of

203

the viral progeny in the apical washes reappeared at the late time points, even though virus

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.27.271130; this version posted August 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

204

burdens were at similar levels at these peaks (Fig. 4A&C, SFig. 1A). These observations

205

suggest the regeneration of the destructive mucosal lesions occur during the SARS-CoV-2

206

infection and that such repair is sufficient to prevent the viral shedding to the basolateral

207

chamber, although the repair did not lead to the recovery of the TEER of the infected HAE (Fig.

208

4B&D). Different observation was from the infection of HAE-ALIL209, in which the epithelial cells

209

from donor L209 were cultured and polarized in the large Millicell™ inserts (1.1 cm2). Traces of

210

viral shedding in the basal medium were also found at the late time points and their levels

211

changed responding to each peak of the virus replication (SFig. 3A). We reasoned that this is

212

due to the inefficient epithelium repair in the infected HAE-ALIL209, which was affected by either

213

donor variation or different culture format.

214

The recurrent peaks of virus progeny released during the course of infection were further

215

displayed in infections of HAE-ALIB4-20 at lower MOIs of 0.02 and 0.002 (Fig. 4C), which show

216

three almost identical peaks at 3, 13, and 26 dpi over the course of 30 days. Of note, the 3rd

217

peak became obvious at 26 dpi from these low MOI infections, compared to 30 dpi for the

218

higher MOI of 0.2, but the amounts of infectious virions released from those peaks remained at

219

roughly the same level (~1 × 106 pfu/ml). The epithelial damage was indicated by the decrease

220

of TEER beginning at 2 and 3 dpi, respectively (Fig. 4D), and also revealed by the dispersed

221

ZO-1 expression and loss of cilia (Fig. 5, MOIs=0.02 and 0.002).

222

We then further carried out the infection at much lower MOIs, 0.0002 and 0.00002,

223

receptively, over a course of 3 weeks. Surprisingly, we found that HAE-ALIB4-20 cultures were

224

not infected by SARS-CoV-2, as evidenced by no NP+ cells at 30 dpi. (Fig. 5, MOI=0.0002 and

225

0.00002) and no infectious virions released from the apical side were detectable. To verify this

226

result, we performed infections in HAE-ALIB9-20 at MOIs of 0.0002 and 0.00002, which

227

reproduced the same observations of no productive infection in the cultures derived from a

228

different lung donor (SFig. 5). At MOIs of 0.0002 and 0.00002, we did not observe an obvious

229

loss of cilia in both infected HAE-ALIB4-20 and HAE-ALIB9-20 (Fig. 5B and SFig. 5B); however, we

230

observed a cytoplasmic expression and a weak junction expression of ZO-1 at 30 dpi (Fig. 5A)

231

and 21 dpi (SFig. 5A) for infected HAE-ALIB4-20 and HAE-ALIB9-20, respectively. These results

232

demonstrate that a high viral load (at least >100 pfu (~8.2 ×104 vgc) to an epithelium of 0.33

233

cm2, which contains with ~5 ×105 epithelial cells, is necessary to initiate a productive infection.

234
235

Ciliated and goblet cells are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 but not the basal and club cells.

236

We next examined SARS-CoV-2 infection in which the inoculation of a high MOI of 2

237

was applied to the basolateral side in HAE-ALIB4-20. The results showed there were no

238

detectable infectious virions released from both the apical and basolateral sides (Fig. 6A). The

239

TEER of the infected HAE displayed no significant changes over the course of 24 days (Fig.

240

6B), which was also evidenced for the well-preserved tight junctions (Fig. 6C), as well as the

241

rich cilia expression (Fig. 6D). Importantly, NP+ cells were not detected for as long as 23 dpi.

242

Similar results were verified in infection of HAE-ALIB9-20 over an infection course of 3 weeks.

243

These results demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 does not infect epithelial cells from the basolateral

244

side.

245

To determine the permissive epithelial cell types in the infected HAE-ALI, we carefully

246

examined the infected cells by immunofluorescent assays using various epithelial cell markers.

247

Cells were dissociated from the supportive membrane of the infected Transwell® inserts and

248

cytospun onto slides for imaging. Co-staining of a specific cell marker and the viral NP

249

expression visualized the cell types permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results, as the

250

representative images shown in Fig. 7, demonstrated that the majority of cell populations in the

251

HAE-ALI were basal cells, which expressed cytokeratin 5 (CKRT5+) 41, and ciliated cells with

252

positive anti-β-tubulin IV staining. Consistent with previous imaging results (Fig. 3), most of the

253

NP+ cells were also positive with anti-β-tubulin IV staining (Fig. 7A), whereas almost all the

254

CKRT5+ basal were negative for anti-NP staining (Fig. 7C). Probing secretoglobin family 1A

255

member 1 (SCGB1A1) expression for club cells and mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) expression for

256

goblet cells 41 revealed that the secretory cells were less abundant sub-populations in the

257

infected HAE-ALI cultures. While we could not locate any club cells stained positively for NP

258

expression (Fig. 7D), we found some NP+/MUC5AC+ goblet cells (Fig. 7B). Importantly, we

259

observed that in the infected HAE-ALI, a subset of CYKT5+ basal cells are found associated

260

with the expression of Ki67; however, in the mock-infected HAE-ALI, we did not found the cells

261

co-expressing both Ki67 and CYKT5 (Fig. 8B). As Ki67 is a marker of cell proliferation 42, this

262

result suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infection activates basal cells towards proliferation.

263

Taking these lines of evidence together, our results confirmed SARS-CoV-2 mainly

264

infects ciliated cells of HAE, as well as the goblet cells, despite its lower abundance in HAE-ALI

265

cultures. Our study suggests that basal and club cells are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2.

266
267

Discussion

268

In this study, we modeled SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE-ALI cultures generated from

269

primary bronchial epithelial cells directly isolated from 4 lungs of independent donors without

270

cell expansion. The infections were conducted at various MOIs, from both apical and basolateral

271

sides, and for a long period from 21-51 days. Our studies demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2

272

infection of HAE results in multiple replication peaks of virus progeny at MOIs from 2 to as low

273

as 0.002, although the length of peak emergence time varied from ~7-10 days. The most

274

striking result we obtained is the resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection at an MOI of 0.0002 (~300

275

pfu/cm2 of epithelium). Our studies also revealed that the basal (CKRT5+) cells and club

276

(SCGB1A1+) cells are not infected, whereas ciliated cells (β-tubulin IV+) and goblet

277

(MUC5AC+) cells are the primary body of the infected cells in the SARS-CoV-2-infected HAE.

Whole-mount immunohistochemistry of SARS-CoV-2 infected HAE cultures revealed

279

that ciliated cells were the cell type predominately infected 38. With the single epithelia cell

280

suspension recovered from the infected inserts, we prepared the cytospins to investigate in

281

detail the cell types permissive to the infection. It is very interesting that secretory goblet and

282

club cells behave oppositely to SARS-CoV-2 infection, since both of these two cell types are the

283

surface epithelial cells accessible on the airway lumen 38. The permissibility of goblet cells to

284

SARS-CoV-2 infection was previously reported by immunochemistry staining of biopsy airway

285

section specimens from patients of COVID-19 36, as well as being supported by a recent in vitro

286

modeling of HAE 34. Club cells express the viral receptor ACE2, but at a less abundant level

287

than goblet cells and ciliated cells 43. The finding of club cell’s failure to establish productive

288

SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests a possible lack of the expression of the entry essential serine

289

protease TMPRSS-2 in this cell type 44, 45. Of note, club cells are non-ciliated epithelial cells and

290

they are restricted to just the small airways in humans 46. While club cells are recognized as

291

secretory cells of major importance to the epithelium, they also act as a stem cell, multiplying

292

and differentiating into ciliated cells and goblet cells to regenerate the bronchiolar epithelium 47.

293

In mouse trachea, the club cells exist as a transiently amplifying population, and their capacity

294

for self-renewal and multilineage differentiation is enhanced after injury 48. Taking together with

295

the fact that the basal cells are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection but the basal cell

296

proliferation was activated after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 8B), the basal and possibly also the

297

club cell types should play an important role in repairing the epithelium lesions caused by viral

298

infection.

299

Our observation that SARS-CoV-2 was unable to infect epithelial cells from the

300

basolateral side supports that the viral entry receptor ACE2 is polarly expressed at the apical

301

side 30, 31. We believe the finding that CKRT5+ basal cells are largely not infected by SARS-

302

CoV-2 is important to understand the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE. The airway basal

303

cells are the epithelial cell type not presenting on the surface of the airway lumen, thus, they are

304

not usually accessible to the virus on the apical side. However, when the infection commences

305

and the epithelial damage occurs, the destructive mucosal lesions (and the death of the infected

306

ciliated and goblet cells) would allow the virus to get access the basal cells (Fig. 8C). Indeed,

307

the detectable virus shedding to the basolateral chamber (Fig. 4A&C, SFig. 1A and SFig. 3A)

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.27.271130; this version posted August 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

308

indicates a possible window to expose the basal cells to SARS-CoV-2. Notably, these time

309

points also represent the peaks of the release of virus progeny. However, none of the CKRT5+

310

cells that was also NP-positive was found from the cytospins prepared from SARS-COV-2

311

infected HAE at 9 dpi when the infection appeared at the lowest level. We hypothesize that the

312

non-permissive nature of basal cells to SARS-CoV-2 is due to the negligible expression of

313

ACE2 49 or TMPRESS-2 43.

314

The epithelial cell lining of the airways provides an efficient barrier against microbes and

315

aggressive molecules through interdependent functions, including mechanical clearance of the

316

mucus executed by movements of the cilia, a cellular barrier function by means of intercellular

317

epithelial junctions formed by a set of tight junction associated proteins such as ZO1, and

318

homeostasis of ion transport 40. At the airway epithelial cellular level, the tight junction–

319

associated proteins, such as ZO1, occludin, and claudins, play a central part in the epithelial

320

cytoprotection by maintaining a physical selective barrier between external and internal

321

environments. The tight junction proteins are highly labile structures whose formation and

322

structure may be very rapidly altered after airway injury, for example, airway inflammation.

323

Proinflammatory cytokines have a drastic effect on tight junction expression and barrier

324

functions, which significantly alter the epithelial barrier permeability 50-52. SARS-CoV-2 infection

325

distorted the ZO-1 expression, and thereafter causes barrier dysfunction (TEER decrease). The

326

infection not only alters the ZO-1 expression of infected (NP1+ cells) but also uninfected cells

327

(NP- cells) (Fig. 3). This is also true for the cilia loss. We believe that SARS-CoV-2 infection

328

produces inflammatory cytokines as an innate immunity response upon virus infection 53, which

329

either disturbs ZO-1 and tubulin expression or alters their structures. The innate immunity

330

response also limits virus infection at the front line. In fact, SARS-CoV-2 requires a high viral

331

load (>300 pfu/cm2 of HAE) to initiate a productive infection (Fig. 4). Of note, the infectious titer

332

(pfu) was determined by plaque assay in Vero-E6 cells, which are interferon-deficient 54. We

333

determined that 1 pfu of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cells has a particle (viral genome copy)

334

number of 820, suggesting that a load of 2.46 x 105 particles is required to productively infect 1

335

cm2 of the airway epithelium, which is much higher than the small DNA virus parvovirus human

336

bocavirus 1 (HBoV1) we studied 55. HBoV1 can infect HAE at an MOI of as low as 0.001

337

genome copies per cell, which equals 1.5 x 103 particles per 1 cm2 of the airway epithelium.

338

Epithelial regeneration involves migration of the basal cells that neighbor the acute

339

injured area (e.g., virus-infected area), active dividing and squamous metaplasia, rapid

340

redifferentiation to preciliated cells, and finally ciliogenesis towards a complete pseudostratified

341

mucociliary epithelium 56. Airway epithelium repair is critical for the maintenance of the barrier

342

function and the limitation of airway hyperreactivity. In a biopsy study of fresh tracheas and

343

lungs from five deceased COVID-19 patients, it was found that the epithelium was severely

344

damaged in some parts of the trachea, and extensive basal cell proliferation was observed in

345

the trachea, where ciliated cells were damaged, as well as in the intrapulmonary airways 37.

346

These data support our conclusion that basal cells are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2. As a

347

response to these previous findings, our study observed that a subset of proliferating basal cells

348

in the SARS-CoV-2 infected HAE-ALI, but not in the mock infected HAE-ALI (Fig. 8B). Thus, we

349

hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces basal cell proliferation, which accounts for the

350

observed long-lasting infections with recurrent peaks of viral replication, which warrants future

351

investigation.

352

Overall, we propose a model of SARS-CoV-2-infection of HAE (Fig. 8C): SARS-CoV-2

353

selectively infects ciliated and goblet cells on the surface of the airway lumen (the apical side of

354

HAE). Upon invading these cells, SARS-CoV-2 replicates and produces infectious virions, and

355

eventually leads to the cell death and epithelial damage. Upon the destructive lesions, airway

356

epithelium has the capacity to progressively repair and regenerate itself. Thus, basal cells

357

(possibly also including club cells) proliferate and differentiate to ciliated cells or goblet cells to

358

fill up the areas that have lost ciliated or goblet cells. Then, the virus released from the last

359

round of infection infects newly regenerated ciliated or goblet cells (repaired epithelia), followed

360

by the second round of active replication and virus production. Therefore, the airway epithelial

361

regeneration confers a persistent, cyclically peaked infection of SARS-CoV-2 in human

362

epithelia.

The primary HAE-ALI cultures HAE-ALIB3-20, HAE-ALIB4-20, and HAE-ALIB9-20 were

389

provided by the Cells and Tissue Core of the Center for Gene Therapy, University of Iowa 18, 57-

59

391

isolated human bronchial epithelial cells from the donor tissues were seeded onto collagen-

392

coated, semipermeable polycarbonate membrane inserts (0.33 cm2, 0.4 μm pore size, Costar

393

Transwell®, Cat #3413, Corning, New York), and grown at an ALI as previously described 60.

394

The cultures were maintained in USG medium containing 2% Ultroser G (USG) serum

395

substitute (Pall BioSepra, France). After 3-4 weeks of culture at an ALI, the polarized culture

396

was fully differentiated. The polarity of the HAE was determined for the transepithelial electrical

397

resistance (TEER) using an epithelial Volt-Ohm Meter (Millipore). A value of 1,000 Ω.cm2 or

398

higher was chosen for SARS-CoV-2 infection as we previously used for HBoV1 infection 52, 61.

399

HAE-ALIL209 cultures on 1.1 cm2 Millicell™-PCF (Millipore, Billerica, MA) were provided by Dr.

400

Matthias Salathe, which were generated following a published method 62 using primary airway

Virus infection, sample collection and titration:
Virus infection: For apical infection, well-differentiated primary HAE-ALI in Transwell®

405

inserts (0.33 cm2; Costar) or in Millicell™ inserts (1.1 cm2; Millipore) were inoculated with 100 µl

406

or 300 µl of SARS-CoV-2 at various MOIs, as indicated in each figure legend, applied to the

apical chamber. For basolateral infection, HAE-ALI cultures in Transwell® inserts were

408

inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 diluted in 500 µl of USG medium added to the basolateral

409

chamber. The infected HAE-ALI cultures were incubated at 37°C 5% CO2 for 1 h followed by

410

aspiration of the virus from the apical or basolateral chamber and washing of the cells with D-

411

PBS three times (the last wash was saved and used for plaque assay, which was presented as

412

the virus residue right after infection at the day 0 post infection (0 dpi)). The HAE-ALI cultures

413

were then further cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2.

414

Viral sample collection: Viral samples were collected from both the apical wash of the

415

epithelium surface and the culture medium in basolateral chamber at multiple time points. In

416

brief, 100 μl (or 300 μl) of D-PBS was added to the apical chamber for a short incubation of 30

417

min at 37ºC and 5% CO2. Thereafter, this apical wash was recovered carefully from the apical

418

chamber without disturbing the culture. To quantitate the viruses released from the basal

419

membrane to the culture medium, 100 µl of medium were collected from each basolateral

420

chamber. The infectious titers in the collected samples were determined by plaque assays in

421

Vero-E6 cells.
Plaque assays: Vero-E6 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of ~0.5 ×106

422
423

cells and grown to confluence the second day. Virus (apical washes or basolateral media) were

424

serially diluted at 10-fold in D-PBS. 200 µl of the diluent were added to each well and incubated

425

for 1 h on a rocking rotator. After removing the virus diluent, ~0.5 ml of overlay media (1%

426

methylcellulose (Sigma, M0387) in DMEM with 5% FBS) were added to each well. The plates

427

were incubated at 37°C under 5% CO2 for 4 days. After removing the methylcellulose overlays,

428

cells were fixed using the 10% formaldehyde solution for 30 min and stained with 1% crystal

429

violet solution followed by extensive washing using distilled water. Plaques in each well were

430

manually counted and multiplied by the dilution factor to determine the virus titer at the unit of

431

pfu/ml.

432

RT-qPCR: To eliminate free viral RNA in the samples, 25 units of Benzonase (Sigma)

433

was added to 100 µl of the virus samples for 30 min 63. The nuclease-treated samples were

434

used for viral RNA extraction using the Viral RNA extraction kit (Quick-RNA Viral Kit, R1035,

435

Zymo Research) following the manufacturer’s instructions. M-MLV reverse transcriptase

436

(#M368A, Promega) was used to reverse transcribe viral RNA with the reverse PCR primer

437

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 2.5 μl of the cDNA was quantified by TaqMan

qPCR in a reaction of 25 µl to determine the number of viral genome copies (vgc) using the

439

CDC 2019-nCoV_N1 set of primers and probe, which were synthesized at IDT (Coralville,

440

Iowa). The plasmid pcDNA6B-(SARS-CoV-2)N, which contains the SARS-CoV-2 NP gene (nt

441

998-2,244), was used as reference control (1 vgc = 7 × 10-12 μg) to establish a standard curve

Immunofluorescent confocal microscopy:
Immunofluorescent assay: For analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the HAE

446

grown on the supportive membrane of the Transwell® inserts, we cut off the membrane from the

447

inserts and fixed them with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4°C overnight. The fixed membrane

448

was washed in PBS for 5 mins three times and then split into 4 (for 0.33 cm2 membrane) or 8

449

(for 1.01 cm2 membrane) pieces for whole-mount immunostaining. For cell marker analysis, we

450

dissociated the cells off the supportive membrane of the Transwell® inserts by incubation with

451

Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies, Inc. San Diego, CA). After incubation for 1h at 37°C,

452

cells were completely detached from the membrane and well separated. Cells were collected

453

and then cytocentrifuged at 18,000 rom for 3 min onto slides using a Shandon Cytospin 3

454

cytocentrifuge. After cytospun, the slides were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C.

455

The fixed HAE or dissociated cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min

456

at room temperature. Then, the slide was incubated with primary antibody in PBS with 2% FBS

457

for 1 h at 37ºC. After washing, the membrane was incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-

458

and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies, followed by staining of the nuclei with DAPI

459

(4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole).

460

Confocal microscopy: The cells were then visualized using a Leica TCS SPE confocal

461

microscope at the Confocal Core Facility of the University of Kansas Medical Center. Images

462

were processed with the Leica Application Suite X software.

807

(A) HAE-ALI model: Epithelial cells are taken from bronchia of the lung of healthy

808

donors and plated onto Transwell® inserts at an air-liquid interface (ALI) for four weeks. Four

809

major types of the epithelial cells in the well differentiated polarized HAE cultures: basal,

810

ciliated, goblet, and club cells are diagrammed in the Transwell® insert, and their expression

811

makers are indicated. (B) Basal cells in proliferation. Epithelial cells of the mock- and SARS-

812

CoV-2-infected HAE-ALIB9-20 cultures at 9 dpi (MOI=0.2) were dissociated from the Transwell®

813

insert and cytospun onto slides. The cells on the slides were fixed, permeabilized, and

814

immunostained with anti-Ki67 and together with anti-CYKT5. Confocal images were taken at a

815

magnification of 63 ×. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). (C) Model of airway cell

816

regeneration model of SARS-CoV-2 recurrent infections. SARS-CoV-2 infects apical ciliated

817

and goblet cells, in which it replicates to produce infectious progeny and causes the death of the

818

infected cells. The destructive lesion of epithelium induces basal cell proliferation and

819

differentiation to regenerate ciliated and goblet cells, which are readily infected by SARS-CoV-2

820

in the next cycle of the recurrent infections.
