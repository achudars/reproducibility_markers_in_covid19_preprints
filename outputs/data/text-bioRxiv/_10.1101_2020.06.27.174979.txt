Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virions are surrounded by a
lipid bilayer from which spike (S) protein trimers protrude. Heavily glycosylated S trimers
bind the ACE2 receptor and mediate entry of virions into target cells. S exhibits extensive
conformational flexibility: it modulates the exposure of its receptor binding site and later
undergoes complete structural rearrangement to drive fusion of viral and cellular
membranes. The structures and conformations of soluble, overexpressed, purified S
proteins have been studied in detail using cryo-electron microscopy. The structure and
distribution of S on the virion surface, however, has not been characterised. Here we
applied cryo-electron microscopy and tomography to image intact SARS-CoV-2 virions,
determining the high-resolution structure, conformational flexibility and distributions of S
trimers in situ on the virion surface. These results provide a basis for understanding the
conformations of S present on the virion, and for studying their interactions with
neutralizing antibodies.
Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a betacoronavirus (1,2), an
enveloped virus containing a large nucleoprotein (N)-encapsidated positive sense RNA
genome (3). Three transmembrane proteins are incorporated into the viral lipid envelope:
spike protein (S) and two smaller proteins, membrane protein (M) and envelope protein (E)
(3,4). When imaged by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), betacoronaviruses appear as
approximately spherical particles, with variable diameters centered around 100 nm,
containing a dense viroplasm, and bounded by a lipid bilayer from which prominent S
trimers protrude (5,6). S trimers of SARS-CoV-2 identify and bind to the receptor, ACE2, on
the surface of target cells and mediate subsequent viral uptake and fusion (7–11). In doing
so it undergoes a dramatic structural rearrangement from the prefusion form to the
postfusion form (12). The overall architectures of both pre and postfusion forms are well
conserved among coronaviruses (12–14).
During infection, S protein production takes place in an abnormal cellular environment.
Coronaviruses extensively remodel the internal membrane organisation of the cell,
generating viral replication organelles in which replication takes place (15–17). The S
protein, together with the other membrane protein M, and E, are inserted into membranes
of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and traffic to the ER Golgi intermediate compartment
(ERGIC). The encapsidated genome buds into the ERGIC to form virions which are then
trafficked to the plasma membrane and released (15–17).
The prefusion structure of S from coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 has been extensively
studied using ectopic expression of a soluble, secreted form of S, followed by purification
combined with cryo-EM and single particle reconstruction (7,8,18–20). In the prefusion
form, the receptor binding domain (RBD) sits at the top of a broad, trimeric spike, above the
fusion core. Three copies of the RBD are surrounded by three copies of the N-terminal
domain (NTD) which show some mobility (7,8,12,18). In the closed prefusion conformation
all three copies of the RBD lay flat on the spike surface, largely occluding the receptor
binding site, while in the open prefusion conformation one or multiple RBDs can lift up to

expose the receptor binding site (7,8,18,19). The surface of the trimer is extensively
glycosylated with 22 potential N-linked glycosylation sites on each monomer (7,8,21). After
receptor binding, structural transition of the prefusion to the postfusion form brings the
fusion peptide and the transmembrane domain together at one end of a long, needle-like
structure centered around a three-helix bundle (12). Five N-linked glycans are regularly
spaced along the length of the postfusion spike (12).
Obtaining a full understanding of how S proteins function and how they interact with the
immune system, requires knowledge of the structures, conformations and distributions of S
trimers within virions. Here we have applied cryo-EM methods to study the structure,
conformations and distributions of S trimers in situ on the virion surface.
Results and discussion
In order to avoid artefacts associated with virus concentration or purification, we aimed to
image SARS-CoV-2 virions from the supernatant of infected cells without virus concentration
or purification. VeroE6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (isolate
Germany/BavPat1/2020) (22). At 48 h post-infection, supernatant was clarified, inactivated
by fixation with formaldehyde and stored at -80°C. Western blot revealed that
approximately 40 % of S protein on virions has been cleaved at the multibasic cleavage site
into S1 and S2 (Fig. 1A). Fixed supernatant was vitrified by plunge freezing and imaged by
cryo-EM. As expected, given the concentration of virus in cellular supernatants (around 107
plaque forming units/ml), small numbers of individual virions were found scattered around
the grid – these were imaged by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) (Fig. 1B).
Virions were approximately spherical with a diameter to the outside of the lipid bilayer of 91
± 11 nm (n=179) (Fig. S1A). They contain granular densities corresponding to the viral
nucleoprotein, and are studded with S trimers (Fig. 1B,C). These features are generally
consistent with those of other coronaviruses imaged by cryo-EM (4–6). S trimers protruding
from the viral surface had two morphologies – a minority were extended thin structures
reminiscent of the postfusion form, while the majority are wider structures reminiscent of
the prefusion form. This observation contrasts with a recent preprint showing cryo-EM
images of purified SARS-CoV-2 virions inactivated with the nucleic acid modifier βpropiolactone in which only thin protrusions were seen on the viral surface (23), and is
consistent with in situ observations of virus assembly (16).
We also collected tomograms of SARS-CoV-2 virions produced by infection of Calu-3 cells, a
human lung carcinoma cell line that supports virus production to a titre comparable to Vero
cells. The morphology of the virions and the appearance of the S trimers on the surface was
consistent with that seen for virions produced from VeroE6 cells (Fig. S2).
Individual virions contained 25 ± 9 S trimers (Fig. S1B). A small sub-population of virions
contained only few S trimers while larger virions contained more S trimers (Fig. S1B). We
identified 4377 wide S trimers and 116 thin S trimers from 179 virions and subjected them
to subtomogram averaging. The averaged structures, at 9 and 22 Å resolution, respectively,
correspond very well to published structures of purified S trimers in the pre- and postfusion
forms (7,8,12) (Fig. 2A). Overall, approximately 97 % of S trimers are in the prefusion form,

and 3 % in the postfusion form. Pre- and postfusion forms appear to be distributed evenly
among virions.
To assess whether S trimers are present in open and/or closed conformations, we subjected
the RBD regions of individual monomers within the trimers to classification. Three kinds of
classes were found, those with the RBD in the closed position, those with the RBD in the
open position, and those where the RBD was predominantly in the closed position, but with
some weakening of the density, suggesting the presence of more mobile conformations (Fig.
S3). Considering the classes to which each monomer was assigned, we derived structures of
fully closed trimers, and of trimers where one RBD is open, both of which occur
approximately equally frequently (~41% and ~45% of 4377 prefusion trimers) (Fig. 2B, Fig.
S4). We also identified a small number of trimers (~13 % of 4377 prefusion trimers) in which
two RBDs are in the open conformation (Fig. 2B). These observations confirm that the
stochastic opening of the RBD observed in recombinant S trimers also takes place on the
virus surface.
The trimers do not all protrude straight from the viral surface, but can tilt by up to 60°
towards the membrane (Fig. S1C). We grouped trimers according to their orientation
relative to the membrane, and averaged these groups independently. The averaged
structures reveal that the membrane-proximal stalk region acts as a hinge with sufficient
flexibility to allow tilting in all directions (Fig. 2C).
We generated models of individual virus particles, with S trimers located at the position,
orientation and conformation that were determined by subtomogram averaging (Fig. 2D). S
trimers appear to be distributed randomly on the viral surface, with no obvious clustering
and no obvious relationship between location, orientation, and conformation. There is
approximately one trimer per 500 nm2 of membrane surface compared to approximately
one per 100 nm2 for influenza A (24). The sparse distribution of S, together with the
predominantly closed state, suggests that receptor binding may be less dependent on
avidity effects than is the case for pandemic influenza viruses (25).
The very low concentration of particles in cell supernatant makes it challenging to perform
high-resolution structure determination. We therefore concentrated the virus by pelleting
through a sucrose cushion. After concentration, the virus particles deviate from spherical
morphology (Fig. S5), but overall features are preserved. We performed cryo-ET and
subtomogram averaging on the particles, and saw predominantly prefusion S trimers, with
occasional postfusion S trimers. Upon classification of the prefusion S we were only able to
identify the RBD in the closed position, and monomers in which a weak RBD density is
observed (Fig. S3C).
Virions in the supernatant of infected cells show primarily prefusion S trimers which are in
either closed or open prefusion conformations. Virions concentrated through a sucrose
cushion continue to show prefusion conformations, but the open conformation is no longer
observed. Other studies have shown that virions fixed with β-propiolactone are primarily in
a postfusion state (23). We note that S trimers purified from membranes were found only in
the closed prefusion and postfusion conformations (12), while other studies have suggested
that the open RBD in soluble S protein trimers is found in a continuum of different positions

(26). These observations suggest that the open prefusion conformations of the spike protein
we observe in situ, but not after concentration, are fragile and may be affected by
purification procedures, which has implications for vaccination strategies.
We next imaged the concentrated virus in 2D by cryo-EM and performed single-particle
analysis on those prefusion S trimers that protruded from the sides of the virus particles as
identified by a neural network picking algorithm, generating a consensus structure of the
prefusion trimer at 3.7 Å resolution. Focussed classification with partial signal subtraction
on individual RBD monomers led to two classes (Fig. S5). Consistent with the observations
from cryo-ET, we observed 66% of the monomers in which the RBD is in the closed
conformation and 34% of the monomers in which density for the RBD is weaker. We then
refined the structures of S trimers in which all three RBDs are in the closed conformation,
and those in which one RBD is weak, to resolutions of 3.9 Å and 4.3 Å, respectively (Fig. 3A,
Fig. S6). The two structures are highly similar, differing only in the density levels for one
RBD. We therefore used the structure with three closed RBDs to build and refine an atomic
model. In this way we obtained an in situ structure for the S protein trimer on the viral
surface.
The positions of glycans on the surface of S are well resolved in our structure with strong
density at 17 of the 22 predicted N-glycosylation sites (Fig. 3B). The other 5 glycosylation
sites are in disordered NTD loops or in the stalk region not resolved at high resolution. In
particular at the base of the trimer a clear ring of glycans forms a collar above the stalk
region. The density for the stalk region extends by 2 helical turns compared to published
structures of soluble ectodomain and further at lower resolution before fading out due to
stalk flexibility (Fig. 3C). In contrast with the dense packing of haemagluttinin on influenza
virions (27), SARS-CoV-2 S trimers are sparsely distributed and can be highly tilted towards
the membrane. Epitopes at the base of the head domain, and in the stalk region, would
therefore be accessible to antibodies where they are not protected by the extensive glycan
shell.
We compared the in situ structure of the S trimer to those previously obtained using
exogenously expressed purified protein. A recent preprint described the structure of fulllength trimeric S solubilized in detergent micelles (12). The study identified two features not
present in most structures of soluble trimers of the S ectodomain: ordering of a loop
between residues 833 and 853 (that is also ordered in the structure of the “locked”
conformation of the ectodomain (18); and further ordering of the N-terminal residues to
lock the RBDs in position. We observe weak density for N-terminal residues, and do not
observe folded structure for the 833-853 region. The Germany/BavPat1/2020 SARS-CoV-2
strain we have imaged contains the widely circulating D614G substitution (28), this
mutation abolishes a salt bridge to K854 (Fig. 3D). We did not observe any additional density
that would correspond to bound lipids such as those described in a recent preprint (19), or
other bound co-factors. These may be present sub-stoichiometrically or in rare
conformations but are not a general feature of the S trimer in situ. Overall, our structure is
very similar to that previously published for the soluble trimeric ectodomain in the closed
prefusion form stabilized by a double proline mutation (Fig. S7) (7,8). This provides an
important validation of the use of recombinant, purified S protein trimers for research,
diagnostics and vaccination. By determining the structure of S protein trimers to 3.7 Å

resolution on the virion surface (Fig. 3), we demonstrate the potential of cryo-EM to allow
the study of antibody binding to S in the context of the viral surface. This will be essential to
understand how neutralizing antibodies, in particular against S2 and the stalk region, block
virus infection, thus informing the design of prophylactic vaccines.

Materials and methods
Cells and Virus
VeroE6 cells were obtained from ATCC and were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle
medium (DMEM, Life Technologies) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin,
100 µg/mL streptomycin and 1% non-essential amino acids (complete medium). The
Germany/BavPat1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 was isolated by Prof. Christian Drosten, Charité, Berlin,
and distributed by the European Virology Archive (Ref-SKU: 026V-03883) at passage 2 (P2). A
stock of SARS-CoV-2 was obtained by passaging the virus once in VeroE6 cells (P3). To produce
SARS-CoV-2 virions, VeroE6 cells grown on 75 cm2 side-bottom tissue culture flasks were
infected with SARS-CoV-2 (P3) at MOI of 0.5. Culture media from infected cells were
harvested at 48 h postinfection, clarified by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min, cleared
through a 0.45-µm nitrocellulose filter and fixed with 4% FA for 30 min at RT. Culture medium
was supplemented with 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2) prior to fixation. Virus-containing medium
was subsequently aliquoted and stored at −80°C. Infectious supernatants containing SARSCoV-2 virions were obtained from Calu-3 cells infected with P3 virus at an MOI = 5 for 48 h
and processed as described above.
To obtain SARS-CoV-2 virions at high concentration, infection and harvest of VeroE6 culture
medium were performed as above, followed by concentration of fixation-inactivated virions
from media by ultracentrifugation through a 20% (wt/wt) sucrose cushion (120 min at 27,000
rpm in a Beckman SW32 rotor; Beckman Coulter Life Sciences). Pelleted particles were
resuspended in PBS and stored in aliquots at −80°C.
Western blot
VeroE6 or Calu-3 cells mock infected or infected for 48 h with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 5) were
washed twice in PBS, scraped, pelleted at 700 x g for 5min and lysed in PBS pH 7.4,
containing 1% Triton-X 100 and protease inhibitors (Merck) for 30 min at 4°C. Samples were
centrifuged at 4°C for 30 min and supernatants were collected. Total protein concentration
was calculated using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit (Biorad). Purified viruses were prepared
for western blot by centrifugation of 32 ml of virus containing supernatants on a 10%
sucrose cushion in a Beckmann J25 centrifuge. Centrifugation was performed at 10,000 x g
for 4 h at 4°C. Supernatants were discarded and purified virus pellet were resuspended in
500 µl of PBS. For western blotting, 10 µg of total cell lysates and 5 µl of purified viruses
were diluted in Laemmli buffer and loaded on a pre-casted Criterion XT 4-12% gradient gel
(Biorad). Gels were transfered to PVDF membrane using a wet-electroblotting chamber
system (Biorad) in Towbin buffer containing 10% methanol. Transfer was performed
overnight at 4°C. Membranes were washed in PBS and blocked with 10% milk in PBS
containing 0.2% tween-20 (PBS-T) for 1h. Membranes were incubated for 1 h at RT with
primary antibody specific for spike (Abcam, cat# ab252690) or N-protein (Sino Biological,
cat# 40143-MM05) both diluted at 1:1,000 in PBS-T. Next, the membranes were washed 3
times in PBS-T, incubated with HRP conjugated anti-mouse antibodies for 1 h, washed again
3 times in PBS-T, incubated with western Lightning Plus-ECL reagent (Perkin Elmer;
Waltham, MA) and imaged using an Intas ChemoCam Imager 3.2 (Intas, Göttingen).

Total RNA was isolated from infected VeroE6 cells 48 h after infection with
Germany/BavPat1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 (passage 2). Spike cDNA was produced from the total
RNA using superscript iii (ThermoFisher) with specific RT-primers
(CAATTGTGAAGATTCTCATA). The cDNA was amplified by PCR using specific primers (Fwrd –
ATGTTTGTTTTTCTTGTTTTATT; rev – TTATGTGTAATGTAATTTGA) and the resulting amplicon
was sent for Sanger sequencing. Sequences were compared to the Germany/BatPat1/2020
SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence (Ref-SKU: 026V-03883) and found to be identical. Specific
sequencing primers: Fwrd1 - ATGTTTGTTTTTCTTGTTTTATT; Fwrd2 –
GGTTGGACAGCTGGTGCT; Fwrd3 – CCAACCATACAGAGTAGTAGTA; Rev1 –
GTAGCAGCAAGATTAGCAGAA; Rev2 – TTATGTGTAATGTAATTTGA.
Cryo-EM sample preparation.
Virus samples from the supernatant of infected cells without any concentrations step
(unconc) or concentrated by pelleting through a sucrose cushion (conc) were prepared,
imaged, and processed in parallel. The virus suspension was mixed with 10-nm colloidal gold
(in PBS solution) in 10:1 ratio. Then 3 µl of the solution was added to a glow-discharged
copper grid (C-Flat 2/2, Protochips). Grids were plunge frozen into liquid ethane by backside blotting using a LeicaGP cryo plunger (Leica) and stored in liquid nitrogen until imaging.
Cryo-electron tomography.
Cryo-ET data collection was performed essentially as described previously (29). Cryo-grids
were loaded into an FEI Titan Krios transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV
and images were recorded on a Gatan K2 Summit direct detection camera in counting mode
with a 20 eV energy slit in zero-loss mode. Tomographic tilt series between −60° and +60°
were collected using SerialEM-3.8.0 software (30) in a dose-symmetric scheme (31) with a
3° angular increment. A total dose of 120 e-/A2 per tilt series was distributed evenly among
41 tilt images. The nominal magnification was 81,000 X, giving a pixel size of 1.532 Å on the
specimen. The defocus range was between -2 µm and -6 µm and 10 frames were saved for
each tilt angle. All data acquisition parameters are listed in Table S1.
Frames were motion-corrected in IMOD-4.10.30 (32) and images were dose-filtered using
the alignframes function in IMOD 4.10.30. Exposure filtering was implemented according to
the cumulative dose per tilt as described elsewhere (33). The contrast transfer function
(CTF) was measured using non-dose-filtered images using the ctfplotter package within
IMOD (34). Tilt series stacks were sorted using IMOD newstack function and fiducialalignment of all tilt series was performed in IMOD/etomo. Tomograms with less than three
trackable gold fiducials were discarded. Motion-corrected and dose-filtered tilt stacks were
CTF-corrected by CTF multiplication and tomograms were reconstructed by weighted backprojected in novaCTF (35). Tomograms were low-pass filtered to 50 Å for better visualization
in EMAN2.2 (36) and tomographic slices were visualized with IMOD.
Extraction of S trimers from tomograms
The initial steps of subtomogram alignment and averaging were implemented using
MATLAB (MathWorks) scripts derived from the TOM (37) and AV3 (38) packages as
described previously (39,40). The missing wedge was modelled as the summed amplitude
spectrum of background subtomograms for each tomogram, and was applied during
alignment and averaging.

To generate an initial template model of the spike protein from the viral surface, 68 spikes
were manually picked from four virions of tomograms that were down-scaled by 4x binning
of the voxels. The 68 spikes’ initial Euler angles (2 out of 3) were determined based on the
vector between two points, one on the head of the spike and one the membrane where the
spike anchors, respectively. The 68 spikes were iteratively aligned to one another for four
iterations applying three-fold symmetry to generate a low-resolution template that
resembled a prefusion conformation of the spike. This template was used as an alignment
reference for all virions (below). All postfusion spike proteins were manually identified and
picked and initial Euler angles were assigned in the same manner.
The center of each virion was then marked manually using the Volume Tracer function in
UCSF Chimera (41) and the radius of the virion was determined centered at the membrane
using the Pick Particle Chimera Plugin (42). An oversampled spherical grid of points was
generated on the virion surface with ~9 nm spacing, and subtomograms were extracted for
all grid points with a box size of 96 pixels (approximately 60 nm) centered at a radius 14 nm
above these grid positions (approximately the radius of the expected center of the spike).
Initial Euler angles were assigned to each subtomogram based on the orientation of the
normal vectors relative to the sphere surface.
Subtomograms were aligned against the low resolution template using subTOM software.
During this alignment, subtomogram positions converged onto clusters at the true spike
positions. One subtomogram position was kept for each cluster, excluding particles within a
distance of 10 pixels and removing particles with cross-correlation coefficients (CCC) below
0.09. Visual inspection of the tomograms using the Place Object Chimera Plugin (42)
confirmed that the subtomograms selected in this manner corresponded to S trimers on the
viral surface.
Subtomogram averaging
Subsequent processing was performed in RELION (43). For this purpose, subtomograms
were reconstructed from the original tilt series images after motion correction using the
relion_reconstruct program. Using dedicated python scripts, the S trimer positions
in the 3D tomograms from the subTOM procedure outlined above were converted into 2D
positions and defocus values in the corresponding tilt series images, as well as Euler angles
in the RELION convention. Individual sub-tomograms were reconstructed at a 2x downscaled pixel size of 3.064 Å, by 3D insertion of Fourier slices of the cropped regions of the tilt
series images, each multiplied by their corresponding CTF, which included the dose filter.
Similarly, 3D-CTF volumes were generated by 3D insertion of the corresponding CTF2 slices.
Subtomograms were reconstructed in a box size of 128 voxels for prefusion trimers and a
box size of 192 voxels for postfusion trimers.
In order to deal with the CTF pre-multiplied sub-tomograms, as well as the multiplicity of
each 3D voxel in the tilt series and the, a modified version of RELION was used for
subtomogram refinement and classification (details to be described elsewhere). Standard
3D auto-refinement was performed with C3 symmetry and a soft-edged mask around the
trimers, using a 30 Å low-pass filtered map generated from subTOM alignment parameters

as initial reference. Using 4377 subtomograms, a 9 Å consensus map was calculated for the
prefusion trimers; 116 postfusion trimers led to a 22 Å map.
Next, we performed symmetry expansion (44), followed by focused classification without
alignment and with partial signal subtraction, while keeping the orientations from the
consensus refinement fixed. The mask used for focused classification was generated
manually and enclosed the RBD of one monomer, including the closest NTD of the
neighbouring monomer. Classification of the primary dataset (unconc1) led to three
different RBD states: closed (50% of the monomers); open (25%) and with weak density
(25%) (Fig. S3A). Classification of a second, smaller data set of virus particles in supernatant
(unconc2), comprising 1566 trimers yielded 39% closed RBD, 24% open RBD and 38% weak
RBD, in general agreement with the unconc1 results (Fig. S3B). Classification of a dataset of
virus particles after concentration through a sucrose cushion (conc), comprising 3392
trimers, yielded 66% of the monomers corresponding to closed RBDs and 34% to RBDs with
weak density. For this data set, no RBDs in the open conformation were identified (Fig S3C).
The classification of the RBDs as closed, open or with weaker density was used to divide the
unconc1 dataset into three subsets: 41% (1789 trimers) have no open RBDs; 45% (1977
trimers) have one RBD in the open state; and 13% (572 trimers) have two open RBDs. The
remaining 39 trimers have three RBDs in the open state and not further processed. In the
class with weaker density, the RBD appears to be predominantly in the closed state and was
treated as closed for this assignment. For each of the three subsets, reconstruction of the
two independently refined half sets was performed using the orientations from the
consensus refinement that gave the 9 Å consensus map described above. Subsequent
standard post-processing procedures for resolution estimation, map sharpening and localresolution filtering in RELION led to three final maps. The subset with no open RBDs gave a
reconstruction with C3 symmetry in which all three RBDs were closed at 9.5 Å resolution.
The other two subsets yielded structures with C1 symmetry and either one or two open
RBDs, with resolutions of 9.3 Å and 10 Å, respectively (Figs. S3 and S4).
Averages of tilted spikes were generated by grouping according to the tilt and rotation of
the subtomogram away from the normal vector to the membrane. Subtomograms were
included in a group for averaging if they were within 15° of the displayed tilt (0°, 25° and
50°) and rotation (0°, 60°).
Single particle Cryo-EM sample preparation and image acquisition
Virus solution concentrated through a 20% (wt/wt) sucrose cushion was frozen on C-Flat 2/2
3C grids (Protochips) following the same procedure as for cryo-ET, but without adding gold
fiducials. Grids were imaged on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Titan Krios transmission electron
microscope that was operated at 300 kV, using a Gatan K3 direct electron detector and a
Gatan BioQuantum energy filter with a 20 eV energy slit. Movies with 48 frames and an
accumulated dose of 50 electrons/Å2 were acquired in counting mode using SerialEM-3.8.0
(30) at a nominal magnification of 81,000 X, corresponding to a calibrated pixel size of 1.098
Å/pixel. Detailed data acquisition parameters are summarized in Table S2.

The Scheduler functionality in RELION-3.1 was used for fully automated real-time processing
during data collection (18,45). Movies were motion-corrected and dose-weighted using
RELION's implementation of the MotionCor2 algorithm (46). Subsequently, dose-weighted
sums were used to estimate the contrast transfer function (CTF) in CTFFIND-4.1.13 (47). S
trimers that were extending from the sides of virus particles were picked manually (973
particles from the first 100 micrographs) and then used as a training set for optimisation of
the convolutional neural network in the automated particle picking software Topaz (48).
Extracted particles were subjected to 3D classification using a previously determined
structure of the S trimer (18), lowpass-filtered to 30 Å, as initial 3D reference. The selected
286,407 particles that contributed to 3D classes corresponding to S trimers were submitted
to Bayesian polishing to correct for per-particle beam-induced motions and a second round
of 3D classification to select the 55,159 particles that contributed to the best class. This final
consensus set of particles was subjected to CTF refinement of per-particle defocus, permicrograph astigmatism and beam tilt, followed by a second round of Bayesian polishing. 3D
auto-refinements were performed with the selected particles after each round of 3D
classification, CTF refinement or Bayesian polishing. The consensus structure had a
resolution of 3.7 Å.
Subsequently, symmetry expansion (44), followed by focused 3D classification with partial
signal subtraction (49) was performed. Using a mask on a single RBD to focus classification
into six classes, while keeping the orientations of the last consensus refinement fixed,
resulted in the identification of two RBD states: closed or with weak density. S trimers with
all three RBDs in the closed state were refined separately from S trimers with one RBD with
weak density, resulting in two final maps with resolutions. Standard RELION post-processing
was used for resolution estimation, map sharpening and local-resolution filtering. The C3
symmetric map with three closed RBD had an estimated overall resolution of 3.9 Å; the C1
map with one weaker RBD extended to 4.3 Å resolution.
Single particle Cryo-EM model building and refinement
The SARS-CoV-2 S trimer structure (PDBID: 6VXX) was used as an initial model for building
into the model with three closed RBDs (Fig S6, middle). Residues were adjusted manually in
Coot 0.9 (50). Steric clash and sidechain rotamer conformations were improved using the
Namdinator web server. After further iterations of manual adjustment, the structure was
refined in PHENIX-1.18.2 (51). The geometry and statistics are given in Table S2. The
unmasked model-to-map FSC was calculated in PHENIX for the refined model against the full
reconstruction.
3D model building of spikes on authentic virions.
In order to visualize the spike protein on the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virions, the coordinates,
orientations and conformational classes determined by subtomogram averaging were
converted into a format compatible with Maxon Cinema 4D, and imported together with
the 3D models of the different conformational states determined by subtomogram
averaging. The HR2 region was modeled as a cylinder. Images of individual virions from the
dataset were rendered into Adobe Photoshop to generate images for presentation.

from individual asymmetric units from the S trimer (red dashed circle) were locally classified to
sort different conformations of RBD. S trimers with all three RBDs in the closed state were further
refined with C3 symmetry. S trimers where one RBD had weak density (red arrowhead) were
refined with C1 symmetry. For further details see materials and methods.
