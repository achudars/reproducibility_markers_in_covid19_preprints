ABSTRACT

36

Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) is associated with respiratory disease and is

37

prevalent worldwide, but in vitro model for virus replication is lacking. Interaction between the

38

coronaviral spike (S) protein and its receptor is the major determinant of virus tissue and host

39

specificity, but virus entry is a complex process requiring a concerted action of multiple cellular

40

elements. Here, we show that KLK13 is required for the infection of the human respiratory

41

epithelium and is sufficient to mediate the entry of HCoV-HKU1 to non-permissive RD cells.

42

We also demonstrated HCoV-HKU1 S protein cleavage by KLK13 in the S1/S2 region, proving

43

that KLK13 is the priming enzyme for this virus. Summarizing, we show for the first time that

44

protease distribution and specificity predetermines the tissue and cell specificity of the virus

45

and may also regulate interspecies transmission. It is also of importance that presented data may

46

be relevant for the emerging coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and may help to understand

47

the differences in their zoonotic potential.

INTRODUCTION

49

Coronaviruses are the largest group within the order Nidovirales. Mainly, they cause

50

respiratory and enteric diseases in humans and animals, but some can cause more serious

51

conditions such as hepatitis, peritonitis, or neurological disease. Seven coronaviruses infect

52

humans, four of which (human coronavirus [HCoV]-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and

53

HCoV-HKU1) cause relatively mild upper and lower respiratory tract disease and two (SARS-

54

CoV and MERS-CoV) are associated with severe, life-threatening respiratory infections and

55

multiorgan failure (1-6). Furthermore, in December 2019 a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2

56

emerged in Hubei province, China, causing pneumonia. To date, almost 90,000 cases were

57

identified and 3,000 patients died worldwide.

58

Coronaviral infection is initiated by interaction between the trimeric spike (S) protein

59

and its receptor, which is expressed on the surface of the susceptible cell. A number of adhesion

60

and entry receptors have been described for coronaviruses. For example, HCoV-229E (similar

61

to many other alphacoronaviruses) utilizes aminopeptidase N (APN) as the primary entry port

62

(7). Surprisingly, its cousin HCoV-NL63 shares receptor specificity with the evolutionarily

63

distant SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2: all hijack angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (8-

64

11). HCoV-NL63 was also shown to use heparan sulfate as a primary attachment site (12-14).

65

A very different receptor is recognized by MERS-CoV, which binds to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4

66

(DPP4) (9, 15, 16). Another betacoronavirus, HCoV-OC43, binds to N-acetyl-9-O-

67

acetylneuraminic acid (17, 18). HCoV-HKU1 remains the great unknown because its cellular

68

receptor has not been identified and all efforts to culture the virus in vitro have failed.

69

HCoV-HKU1 was identified in Hong Kong in 2004. The virus was present in a sample

70

obtained from an elderly patient with severe pneumonia (19). Epidemiological studies show a

71

high prevalence of the pathogen in humans; this is because the majority of children seroconvert

72

before the age of 6 years (20, 21). While it is not possible to culture HCoV-HKU1 in vitro, we

Page 3 of 45

73

and others reported that ex vivo fully differentiated human airway epithelium (HAE) and human

74

alveolar type II cells support the infection (22-25). A thorough study by Huang X et al.

75

demonstrated that HCoV-HKU1 binds to target cells via O-acetylated sialic acids on the cell

76

surface; however, this interaction is not sufficient for the infection. The study also showed that

77

the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein of HCoV-HKU1 exhibits sialate-O-acetylesterase

78

activity and may act as a receptor-destroying enzyme, thereby facilitating the release of viral

79

progeny (26). Bakkers et al. proposed that, in order to adapt to the sialoglycome of the human

80

respiratory tract over the evolutionary timescale, HCoV-HKU1 lost the ability to bind to

81

attachment receptors via the HE protein (27). Recently, Hulswit et al. mapped the virus binding

82

site to O-acetylated sialic acids, demonstrating that the S1 domain A is responsible for binding

83

to the attachment receptor (28).

84

The S protein is the main player during coronavirus entry, and its characteristics

85

determine the host range. Coronaviral S proteins are class I fusion proteins comprising a large

86

N-terminal ectodomain, a hydrophobic trans-membrane region, and a small C-terminal

87

endodomain. The ectodomain is highly glycosylated and is composed of S1 and S2 domains.

88

The globular S1 domain is highly variable and carries the receptor-binding site, whereas the

89

more conserved rod-like S2 domain undergoes structural rearrangement during entry, which

90

brings the cellular and viral membranes into close proximity. Such a structural switch may be

91

triggered by different stimuli, including receptor binding, proteolytic cleavage of the S protein,

92

and/or a reduction in pH. Because different species require different stimuli, coronaviruses enter

93

cells at different subcellular sites. Some coronaviruses fuse at the plasma membrane, whereas

94

others are believed to enter the cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis, followed by fusion

95

deep within the endosomal compartments (29-35). Furthermore, recent reports show that the

Page 4 of 45

96

entry portal may vary depending on tissue/cell characteristics. These differences may affect the

97

host range, pathogenicity, and cell/tissue specificity (1).

98

Host proteases prime coronaviral S proteins. For example, trypsin-mediated cleavage in

99

the small intestine is required for entry of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (36), while a number

100

of coronaviruses from different genera (including HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, murine

101

hepatitis virus [MHV], MERS-CoV, and infectious bronchitis virus [IBV]) possess a furin

102

cleavage site (37-41). Kam et al. showed that SARS-CoV S protein can be cleaved by plasmin;

103

however, there is almost no biological evidence for its role in vivo (42). Cathepsins may also

104

act as S protein-activating enzymes. Indeed, cathepsin L processes the S proteins of SARS-

105

CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, and MHV-2 (43-46). However, recent reports show that, in

106

vivo, respiratory coronaviruses may be activated by the TMPRSS2 protease, which enables

107

endocytosis-independent internalization, thereby re-shaping the entry process (45, 47-50).

108

While laboratory strains require priming by cathepsins, S proteins of clinical isolates (e.g.,

109

HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) undergo TMPRSS2-mediated cleavage at the cell surface,

110

which enables them to fuse with the cell membrane on the cell surface (51). A recent study by

111

Shirato et al. demonstrates that coronaviruses may lose their ability to infect naturally

112

permissive HAE cultures during cell culture adaptation because the S gene evolves and adjusts

113

to the proteolytic landscape of the immortalized cells (51).

114

Here, we identified a protease belonging to the tissue kallikrein (KLK) family as a new

115

player essential for HCoV-HKU1 entry to the target cell. The KLK family comprises 15 closely

116

related serine proteases with trypsin- or chymotrypsin-like specificity. The expression of these

117

enzymes is tightly regulated, and each tissue has its own unique KLK expression profile. These

118

enzymes play a role in a diverse range of processes during embryonic development to adulthood

119

(52-56), and some have been linked to human cancers (57-60). The function of some KLKs

120

remains to be elucidated, but obtained results suggest that protease distribution may be an

important factor pre-determining the cell and tissue specificity of the virus, but also regulating

122

the interspecies transfers.

123

Further, the data presented herein bring us a step closer to developing a convenient

124

in vitro culture model and possibly identifying the cellular receptor for this virus. It is also of

125

importance that presented data may be relevant for the emerging coronaviruses and may help

126

to understand the differences in their zoonotic potential.

RESULTS

128

Several KLKs are upregulated after infection of HAE with HCoV-HKU1

129

First, we asked whether HCoV-HKU1 infection modulates the expression of human

130

KLKs. HAE cultures were infected with HCoV-HKU1 or mock-inoculated. At 120 h post-

131

inoculation (p.i.), cells were collected and the expression of mRNAs encoding KLKs was

132

analyzed. We detected the expression of KLK7, KLK8, KLK10, KLK11, and KLK13 in

133

non-infected fully differentiated cultures. However, the pattern in HCoV-HKU1-infected cells

134

was different: we detected an upregulation of KLK7, KLK8, KLK10, KLK11 and KLK13.

135

Further, KLK1, KLK5, KLK6, KLK9, KLK12 and KLK14 were expressed in the infected cells.

136

KLK2, KLK3, and KLK15 were not expressed (Fig. 1).

137
138

KLK13 is essential for HCoV-HKU1 infection

139

S protein priming is a prerequisite for coronavirus entry; therefore, we tested whether

140

KLKs take part in this process by culturing cells in the presence/absence of KLK inhibitors (

141

Table 1) (61). For this, HAE cultures were pre-incubated with each inhibitor (10 µM) or with

142

vehicle control (DMSO) and mock-inoculated or inoculated with the virus (106 RNA copies per

143

ml) in the presence of the inhibitor. Apical washes were collected each day for analysis of virus

144

replication. Subsequently, viral RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed (RT), and the HCoV-

145

HKU1 yield was determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The results showed that

146

HCoV-HKU1 replication was inhibited in the presence of a KLK13 inhibitor; this was not the

147

case for cells treated with DMSO or with inhibitors specific for KLK7 or KLK8 (Fig. 2A).

148

Next, we analyzed HCoV-HKU1 replication in the presence of a family-specific KLK

149

inhibitor SPINK6 at a concentration of 10 µg/ml (62, 63) or 100 µM camostat (a broad inhibitor

150

of serine proteases, also a potent inhibitor of KLK13) (34, 64). We noted inhibition of

151

HCoV-HKU1 replication in the presence of both inhibitors (Fig. 2B). All inhibitors were used

152

at non-toxic concentrations (Fig. 2C).

153

The experiments conducted so far suggested that KLK13 is required for virus infection.

154

However, one may question the specificity of the KLK13 protease inhibitors. To ensure that

155

KLK13 is indeed the priming enzyme during HCoV-HKU1 infection, we developed HAE

156

cultures by transforming cells with lentiviral vectors encoding shRNAs targeting KLK13

157

mRNA. We then confirmed that the expression of the protease was silenced (HAE_shKLK13).

158

Non-modified HAE cultures (HAE_ctrl), cultures modified using a lentiviral vector to express

159

the GFP protein (HAE_GFP), and HAE cultures transduced with an empty lentiviral vector

160

(HAE_vector) were used as controls. Following transduction and differentiation, expression of

161

KLK13 mRNA in HAE_shKLK13 was almost undetectable, in contrast to the control cultures

162

(Fig. 3A). Importantly, HAE_shKLK13 cells continued to differentiate and formed

163

pseudostratified cultures (Fig. 3B). Next, we infected HAE_ctrl, HAE_GFP, HAE_vector, and

164

HAE_shKLK13 with HCoV-HKU1 (106 RNA copies per ml) and incubated them for 2 h at

165

32°C with the viral stock solution. Cultures were maintained at 32°C for 5 days at an air-liquid

166

interface. Apical washes were collected, and virus yield was determined by RT-qPCR. We

167

found that, in contrast to that in control cultures, replication of virus in HAE_shKLK13 was

168

abolished (Fig. 3C). Overall, these data suggest that silencing the KLK13 gene in HAE inhibits

169

virus infection, indicating that KLK13 is necessary for HCoV-HKU1 infection.

170
171

KLK13 enables entry of HCoV-HKU1 pseudoviruses

172

We determined that KLK13 is essential for efficient HCoV-HKU1 infection in HAE

173

cultures and we started to wonder whether this enzyme may be a determinant of the cell and

174

tissue specificity of the virus. Previous studies showed that RD cells support virus attachment

175

via sialic acids, but this does not allow for the virus entry (26). To test whether cell surface

176

proteases my render RD cells permissive, we generated RD cells expressing human KLK13 or

177

TMPRSS2 proteases. RD cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors harboring the KLK13

178

gene (RD_KLK13), control vector (RD_ctrl), or TMPRSS2 (RD_TMPRSS2). Due to the lack

179

of KLK13 specific antibodies, we verified its presence based on RT-PCR (Fig. 4A). The

180

presence of TMPRSS2 in RD_TMPRSS2 cells was confirmed using Western blot. The

181

TMPRSS2 band in RD cells was observed at 25 kDa, which corresponds to one of the naturally

182

occurring splicing variants (Fig. 4B). Subsequently, we transduced RD_ctrl, RD_KLK13 and

183

RD_TMPRSS2 cells with HIV particles pseudotyped with HCoV-HKU1 S glycoprotein

184

(S-HKU1), control VSV G protein (VSV-G) or lacking the fusion protein (ΔEnv). After 3 day

185

culture at 37°C, pseudovirus entry was quantified by measurement of the luciferase activity. As

186

shown in Fig. 4C, all cultures were effectively transduced with control VSV-G vectors, while

187

only RD_KLK13 cells were permissive to S-HKU1 pseudoviruses. This clearly showed that

188

KLK13, and not TMPRSS2 is involved in HCoV-HKU1 entry. Furthermore, S-HKU1,d VSV-

189

G and ΔEnv pseudoviruses were overlaid onto fully differentiated HAE cultures in the presence

190

of KLK13 inhibitor (10 µM) or DMSO. After 3 day culture at 37°C pseudovirus entry was

191

quantified by measurement of the luciferase activity. Despite low transduction efficiency in

192

HAE, we observed an increase in luciferase activity in cultures treated with S-HKU1

193

pseudoviruses, compared to ΔEnv, which was completely abolished in the presence of KLK13

194

inhibitor (Fig 4D). Overall, these data demonstrated that KLK13 activity drives HCoV-HKU1

195

entry into cells.

196
197

KLK13 enables the replication of HCoV-HKU1 in RD cells

198

Obtained results showed that KLK13 expression on RD cells was sufficient for HCoV-

199

HKU1 pseudovirus entry. Here, we aimed to test whether KLK13 presence renders RD cells

200

permissive for HCoV-HKU1 infection. For this, we infected RD_ctrl and RD_KLK13 cells

201

with HCoV-HKU1 (108 RNA copies per ml) and incubated the culture for 7 days at 32°C in the

202

presence or absence of a KLK13 inhibitor (10 µM) or DMSO. Next, cellular RNA was isolated

203

and the presence of HCoV-HKU1 N subgenomic mRNA (N sg mRNA), which is considered

204

to be a hallmark of coronaviral infection, was assessed (14). sg mRNA appeared in RD_KLK13

205

cells, while no signal was detected in cultures supplemented with the KLK13 inhibitor nor in

206

RD_ctrl cells (Fig. 5A).

207

To further confirm the role of KLK13 during HCoV-HKU1 infection RD cells were

208

supplemented with purified human KLK13 or KLK14 (61). The latter was used as a negative

209

control. Virus stock was incubated for 2 h at 32°C with 200 nM KLK13, KLK14, or trypsin or

210

control (PBS). Next, RD cells were incubated for 7 days at 32°C with the virus (diluted 10-fold

211

in DMEM) or mock samples (in DMEM), after which cellular RNA was isolated and

212

HCoV-HKU1 infection was analyzed by means of N sg mRNA detection. Again, we found that

213

N sg mRNA was produced only in the presence of KLK13 (Fig. 5B). Further, we passaged

214

HCoV-HKU1 twice in RD cells. Briefly, 1 ml of cell culture supernatant from the first

215

experiment was transferred to fresh RD cells and fresh enzymes were added (final concentration

216

200 nM). Cultures were then incubated at 32°C for 7 days. Cellular RNA was isolated and

217

HCoV-HKU1 infection was monitored by detecting N sg mRNA. The infection occurred only

218

in the presence of KLK13 (Fig. 5B). However, we observed no cytopathic effects (CPEs), and

219

replication levels were very low (no significant increase over control levels on RT-qPCR; data

220

not shown). To further test the effect of KLK13 on replication of HCoV-HKU1 in RD cells, the

221

virus stock was incubated with purified KLK13 (200 nM) and incubated in the presence or

222

absence of a KLK13 inhibitor (10 µM) or DMSO. After 2 h at 32°C pre-treated virus stock was

223

diluted in media as described above and overlaid on RD cells. After 7 days at 32°C we evaluated

224

the presence of the HCoV-HKU1 N sg mRNA. The virus replicated only after treatment with

225

KLK13, and supplementation with the inhibitor blocked this effect infection (Fig. 5C).

226
227

KLK13 primes the HCoV-HKU1 S protein

228

Expression of KLK13 by cells previously resistant to HCoV-HKU1 renders them

229

susceptible; therefore, we asked whether this is due to proteolytic activation of the S protein.

230

We tested this using the CleavEx method, in which a peptide of interest is exposed in the

231

N-terminal region of the proteolytically-resistant HmuY carrier protein. Briefly, two-hybrid

232

His-tagged CleavEx proteins were prepared, both harboring 8-amino acid peptide sequences of

233

the HCoV-HKU1 S protein. The first peptide contained the S1/S2 cleavage site (amino acids

234

757–764), which in some coronaviruses is activated during protein biosynthesis, during virus

235

exocytosis, or after receptor engagement. The second harbored the S2/S2’ cleavage site (amino

236

acids 901–908), which is an additional region prone to proteolytic cleavage (25, 38). Proteins

237

were purified and further incubated for 3 h at 37°C with increasing concentrations of purified

238

KLK13. Subsequently, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by western blotting

239

with antibodies specific for His-tagged proteins. The analysis showed that, in the presence of

240

500 nM KLK13, the CleavEx protein harboring the S1/S2 cleavage site was degraded; however,

241

the CleavEx protein harboring the S2/S2’ site remained intact. Because KLKs are produced as

242

pro-forms that undergo self-activation, an additional band of His-tagged purified pro-KLK13

243

(HisTag-pro-KLK13) was observed after treatment with 500 nM KLK13 (Fig. 6A). The product

244

of the S1/S2 cleavage was further sequenced by N-terminal Edman degradation showing the

245

following sequence: R↓SISA, which corresponds to the S1/S2 site. This result shows clearly

246

that the S1/S2 region of the HCoV-HKU1 S protein is prone to KLK13-mediated cleavage.

247

Furthermore, we aimed to confirm the cleavage using a full-length Spike protein of

248

HCoV-HKU1 (HKU1-S). For this, we expressed the HKU1-S in 293T cells, purified the protein

249

using 6 × His tag, and incubated for 3 h at 37°C with increasing concentrations of purified

250

KLK13. Subsequently, HKU-S or mock proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by

251

western blotting with antibodies specific to the tag. The analysis showed that in the presence of

252

1 µM KLK13 the HKU1-S was degraded (Figure 6B). The S protein was observed at

253

~150 kDa, which is consistent with the migration speed reported for these highly glycosylated

254

proteins (1).

DISCUSSION

257

Receptor recognition is the first, essential step of the virus infection process. The

258

coronaviral S protein mediates virus entry into host cells by binding to a specific receptor. A

259

combination of stimuli, e.g., receptor binding, proteolytic cleavage, and exposure to low pH

260

results in rearrangement of the S protein and, consequently, to membrane fusion and virus entry

261

(1). Although the structure of both the HCoV-HKU1 S ectodomain and the receptor-binding

262

domain has been resolved, the receptor determinant remains unknown (28, 38, 65). In a previous

263

study, we showed that HCoV-HKU1 utilizes O-acetylated sialic acids on host cells as an

264

attachment receptor (26). Here, we present data demonstrating that the protease KLK13 is

265

required for HCoV-HKU1 infection of the respiratory epithelium.

266

Human KLKs take part in multiple physiological processes, including skin

267

desquamation, tooth enamel formation, kidney and brain function, and synaptic neural plasticity

268

(66-75). Also, recent studies demonstrate a role for some KLKs during viral infections. For

269

instance, KLK8 plays a role in the proteolytic activation of the human papillomavirus capsid

270

protein, thereby mediating virus entry into host cells (76). Also, KLK5 and KLK12 are secreted

271

into the respiratory tract, where they support replication of the influenza A virus by cleaving

272

the hemagglutinin protein (77, 78); however, these proteins belong to a large pool of cell surface

273

proteases, the orchestrated action of which promotes virus replication.

274

Here, we found that the yield of HCoV-HKU1 from HAE fell in the presence of SPINK6

275

(inhibitor of KLK13) (62, 63) and camostat (a broad range inhibitor of serine proteases).

276

However, the first compound also inhibits other KLKs (63), while the second block the activity

277

of a wide range of serine proteases and was used previously to demonstrate the role of

278

TMPRSS2/4 proteases during viral infection (34, 45, 51, 64, 79, 80). The relatively low

279

inhibition of HCoV-HKU1 replication in the presence of SPINK6 possibly results from non-

280

optimal compound concentration at the HAE cultures, and cytotoxicity at higher

281

concentrations(63). Broad spectrum protease inhibitors are now used widely for virus research,

282

although their non-specific activity makes the results equivocal. For example, Matsuyama et al.

283

showed recently that the furin inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK interferes with the activity of several

284

proteases, and that its previously described inhibitory activity during MERS-CoV infection is

285

not specific to furin; instead, its activity is due to non-specific inhibition of cathepsin L and

286

TMPRSS2 (81). We tried to use specific KLK inhibitors developed in our laboratory (61).

287

Considering the small arsenal of tools available to researchers studying KLKs, only three

288

compounds were readily available. Treating HAE cultures with these inhibitors revealed that

289

only compounds designed to inhibit KLK13 hampered HCoV-HKU1 replication. However, the

290

great similarity between different KLKs makes one doubt the specificity of these inhibitors,

291

despite their performance in biochemical assays. Therefore, we decided to silence KLK13 in

292

HAE cultures. This abolished virus replication ex vivo, thereby confirming the importance of

293

KLK13 during infection. KLK13 is thought to be secreted and membrane-bound(82, 83).

294

This study showed that HCoV-HKU1 infection in HAE modulates the expression of

295

different KLKs, including KLK13. In our study, KLKs expression was tested using semi-

296

quantitative PCR, and for that reason, we were unable to show the level of KLKs modulation

297

after HCoV-HKU1. However, the pattern of virus-induced expression of several KLKs could

298

be observed. KLK mechanism of activation is a complex process and until now it has only

299

been proven that most KLK genes are regulated by steroids and other hormones (84). It is also

300

important to remember, that KLK expression is regulated in a similar manner, and the induction

301

of a single gene usually results in overexpression of the whole cluster (85, 86). While one may

302

assume that the virus stimulates KLK13 production to promote the infection, this up-regulation

303

is likely a natural response of the damaged tissue, as KLKs were previously reported to take

304

part also in tissue regeneration (87-89). Further, increased expression of KLKs may be the

305

response to the inflammatory process, as Seliga et al demonstrated that KLK-kinin system is a

306

potent modulator of innate immune responses (90).

307

The experiments performed herein show the importance of KLK13 for virus entry into

308

susceptible cells; therefore, we speculated that scattered distribution of different KLKs in

309

different tissues may be one of the determinants of the HCoV-HKU1 tropism (53, 91). We

310

tested the purified enzyme expressed in the eukaryotic cells; however, we also developed a cell

311

line constitutively expressing the enzyme. As an in vitro model for our studies, we used RD

312

cells previously reported to carry attachment receptors for the virus (26). Here, using

313

pseudoviruses decorated with S-HKU1 proteins we showed that KLK13 presence on RD cells

314

is sufficient for virus entry and renders these cells permissive. Our experiments also showed

315

that in contrast to previous reports, TMPRSS2 is not involved in this process(51). Furthermore,

316

we observed that RD cells supported the replication of the virus in the presence of KLK13 and

317

that this effect was reversed in the presence of the specific KLK13 inhibitor. We were, however,

318

not able to culture the virus to high yields. HCoV-HKU1 replication in KLK13-expressing RD

319

cells remained inefficient and RTqPCR assessment did not reveal significant increases in the

320

amounts of viral RNA. For that reason, we are only able to detect viral sg mRNAs, which are

321

considered to be the hallmark of coronaviral replication.We believe that this may be due to

322

non-optimal infection conditions, which may include inappropriate KLK13 concentrations or

323

low density of the entry receptor. Also, it is possible that RD cells may not support efficient

324

replication of the virus due to factors unrelated to the entry process. Nonetheless, our results

325

show that the HCoV-HKU1 entry receptor is present on RD cells, and we were able to trigger

326

virus entry and replication; these findings warrant further exploration.

327

Most coronaviral S proteins are processed into S1 and S2 subunits by host proteases,

328

which allows conformational changes in the S protein and leads to fusion of the viral and

329

cellular membranes (1, 92). As shown in the recent work by Kirchdoerfer et al., the

Page 15 of 45

330

HCoV-HKU1 S protein has two regions that are prone to proteolytic activation: the S1/S2 furin

331

cleavage site and a secondary cleavage site termed S2’, which is adjacent to a potential fusion

332

peptide (38). While the S1/S2 site is believed to be processed by furin during protein

333

biosynthesis, the S2/S2’ site is expected to be cleaved during virus entry. As we already knew

334

that KLK13 is sufficient for HCoV-HKU1 infection of naturally non-permissive RD cells, we

335

aimed to investigate whether this was the direct result of KLK13-mediated proteolytic cleavage

336

of the S protein. For this, we employed the CleavEx method, in which peptide of interest is

337

coupled to the carrier HmuY protein and then undergoes proteolytic cleavage by the enzyme

338

being tested. We found that the S1/S2 site was efficiently cleaved by KLK13, whereas the

339

S2/S2’ region remained intact. As CleavEx technique is a convenient surrogate system allowing

340

for precise mapping of the cleavage site, it has some limitations. To ensure the reliability of

341

results, purified full-length HCoV-HKU1 S protein was subjected to the proteolytic cleavage.

342

Also here we observed efficient cleavage of the HCoV-HKU1 S protein by KLK13.

343

While the results presented here show that KLK13 is able to process the HCoV-HKU1

344

S protein, one may question whether the cleavage is sufficient for HCoV-HKU1 entry. It was

345

previously presented for MERS-CoV that two consecutive enzymatic scissions are required for

346

activation of the S protein. In this scenario, KLK13 would prime the HCoV-HKU1 S at S1-S2

347

site, enabling scission at S2-S2’ site by the TMPRSS2 or another host protease (38, 40, 93).

348

This may be one of the factors limiting the HCoV-HKU1 replication in RD_KLK13 cells, as

349

only minimal replication is observable.

350

Summarizing, we show that KLK13 is a key determinant of HCoV-HKU1 tropism. This

351

may explain why, since its first identification in 2004, all efforts to culture HCoV-HKU1 in

352

standard cell lines have failed. We believe that this study increases our knowledge of HCoV-

353

HKU1 and may promote the future in-depth investigation of coronaviruses. Considering the

354

increasing number and diversity of coronaviruses, and the proven propensity of coronaviruses

355

to cross the species barrier and cause severe diseases in humans, further research on the role of

356

different proteases in coronaviral infections is necessary.

360

cells. Each PCR product was cloned into pWPI plasmid for lentivirus production and sequence

361

verified. pLKO.1-TRC cloning vector was a gift from David Root (Addgene plasmid #

362

10878)(94). Oligonucleotides for the generation of shRNA against KLK13 (3 different shRNAs

363

targeting the exons encoding the active site) were hybridized and cloned into pLKO.1-TRC

364

vector. The full-length HKU1-S gene was amplified by PCR using pCAGGS/HKU1-S plasmid

365

that was a gift from Xingchuan Huang. The PCR product was cloned into pSecTag2 cloning

366

vector and sequence verified. Primer sequences are provided in Table 2.

Cell culture

369

RD (Homo sapiens muscle rhabdomyosarcoma; ATCC: CCL-135) and 293T (Homo

370

sapiens kidney epithelial; ATCC: CRL-3216) cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s MEM (Thermo

371

Fisher Scientific, Poland) supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum (heat-inactivated; Thermo

372

Fisher Scientific, Poland) and antibiotics: penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and

373

ciprofloxacin (5 μg/ml). Cells were maintained at 37°C under 5% CO2.

374
375

Human airway epithelium (HAE) cultures

376

Human epithelial cells were isolated from conductive airways resected from transplant

377

patients. The study was approved by the Bioethical Committee of the Medical University of

378

Silesia in Katowice, Poland (approval no: KNW/0022/KB1/17/10 dated 16.02.2010). Written

379

consent was obtained from all patients. Cells were dislodged by protease treatment, and later

380

mechanically detached from the connective tissue. Resulting primary cells were first cultured

381

in the selective media to proliferate in the presence of the Rho-associated protein kinase

(ROCK) inhibitor (Y-27632, 10 µg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, Poland) (95). Further, cells were

383

trypsinized and transferred onto permeable Transwell insert supports ( = 6.5 mm). Cell

384

differentiation was stimulated by the media additives and removal of media from the apical side

385

after the cells reached confluence. Cells were cultured for 4-6 weeks to form well-differentiated,

386

pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium (96). All experiments were performed in accordance

387

with relevant guidelines and regulations.

389

Cell viability assay

390

HAE cultures were prepared as described above. Cell viability assay was performed by

391

using the XTT Cell Viability Assay (Biological Industries, Israel), according to the

392

manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, on the day of the assay 100 μl of the 1 × PBS with the

393

30 μl of the activated XTT solution was added to each well/culture insert. Following 2 h

394

incubation at 37°C, the solution was transferred onto a 96-well plate and the signal was

395

measured at λ = 490 nm using the colorimeter (Spectra MAX 250, Molecular Devices). The

396

obtained results were further normalized to the control sample, where cell viability was set to

397

100%.

399

Virus infection

400

HAE cultures were washed thrice with 100 μl of 1 × PBS, following inoculation with

401

HCoV-HKU1 (strain Caen 1) or mock (cell lysate). After 2 h incubation at 32°C unbound

402

virions were removed by washing with 100 μl of 1 × PBS and HAE cultures were cultured at

403

air-liquid interphase until the end of the experiment. Due to the lack of a permissive cell line it

404

was not possible to titrate the virus stock for infection experiments and therefore the inoculum

405

was quantified using RT-qPCR.

milk / TBS-Tween (0.1%). The signal was developed using the Pierce ECL Western blotting

508

substrate (Thermo Scientific, Poland) and visualized using the ChemiDoc Imaging System

509

(Bio-Rad, Poland).

511

Expression and purification of KLK13 and KLK14

512

The proKLK13 gene was amplified using cDNA obtained from HAE cultures and

513

specific primers. The codon-optimized proKLK14 gene was custom-synthesized (Thermo

514

Scientific, Poland). The products were cloned into the pLEXSY_I-blecherry3 plasmid (Jena

515

Bioscience, Germany) and the resulting constructs were verified by sequencing. All

516

preparations for transfection, selection, and expression of the host Leishmania tarentolae strain

517

T7-TR were performed according to the Jena Bioscience protocol for inducible expression of

518

recombinant proteins secreted to medium (LEXSinduce Expression kit, Jena Bioscience,

519

Germany). Expression of proKLK13 and proKLK14 was induced with 15 µg/ml of tetracycline

520

(BioShop, Canada) and carried out for 3 consecutive days. Culture media were collected and

521

precipitated with 80% ammonium sulfate, spun down at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. Pellets

522

were suspended in 10mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5 and dialyzed overnight at 4°C into 10mM

523

sodium phosphate pH 7.5. The KLKs were isolated via the 6 × His tag using nickel resin (GE

524

Healthcare, Poland) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Obtained fractions were

525

analyzed by SDS PAGE in reducing conditions and fractions containing proKLK13 or

526

proKLK14 were concentrated with Vivaspin® 2 (Sartorius, Germany) and further purified

527

using size exclusion chromatography (Superdex s75 pg; GE Healthcare, Poland). Fractions

528

containing proKLK13 or proKLK14 were concentrated and the buffer was changed to 50mM

529

Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl. After purification and self-activation at 37°C for 24 h, activity of

proteases was assessed by serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 6 (SPINK6) titration, as

531

described previously (63).

Cloning of HmuY-based CleavEx fusion proteins

534

The fusion constructs were based on positions 26-216 of the Porphyromonas gingivalis

535

HmuY protein-encoding gene (accession number ABL74281.1), employed as a carrier protein.

536

The gene was amplified using Phusion DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific, Poland) and

537

specific primers (forward: 5’– ATATGCGGCCGCAGACGAGCCGAACCAACCCTCCA –

538

3’ and reverse: 5’ – ATACTCGAGTTATTTAACGGGGTATGTATAAGCGAAAGTGA –

539

3’) from whole-genomic DNA isolated from Porphyromonas gingivalis strain W83. PCR

540

conditions were as follows: 98°C for 30s, followed by denaturation at 98°C for 10s, annealing

541

at 68°C for 40s and extension at 72°C for 30s/kb over 35 cycles with a final extension at 72°C

542

for 7 min. Then, the HmuY gene was further amplified in the three consecutive PCR reactions

543

with primers specific to the 5’ HmuY fragment and 3’-specific primer introducing additional

544

nucleotides dependent on the designed sequence (proKLK13 primers, Table 4). The reaction

545

was ligated into a modified pETDuet plasmid (potential tryptic cleavage sites were removed

546

from the MCS) using Quick Change mutagenesis using Phusion DNA polymerase (Thermo

547

Scientific, Poland). Alternatively, the designed fusion protein-encoding sequences were

548

produced using Phusion Site-Directed Mutagenesis (Thermo Scientific, Poland), via sequence

549

exchange of the previously prepared CleavEx construct (HKU1-S primers, Table 4). The final

550

product was transformed into competent E. coli T10 cells and further purified and sequenced.

551
552

Expression and purification of CleavEx fusion proteins

553

Protein expression was performed in E. coli BL21 and was induced by the addition of

554

0.5 mM IPTG to the bacterial culture (OD600 0.5-0.6), followed by shaking for 3h at 37°C.

555

Then, the bacteria were spun down and the pellet was suspended in buffer A (10 mM sodium

556

phosphate, 500 mM NaCl and 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.4). The pellet suspension was then

557

sonicated and spun down. Soluble proteins were purified using HisTrapTM Excel (GE

558

Healthcare, Poland) column in buffer A with a linear gradient of 0-100% of 1 M imidazole in

559

buffer A in 20 column volumes. Fractions containing protein of interest were pooled together

560

and the buffer was exchanged to 50 mM Tris pH 7.5. Lastly, the protein of interest was purified

561

by ion-exchange chromatography using MonoQ 4.6/100 PE column (GE Healthcare, Poland)

562

with a linear gradient of 0-100% 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1M NaCl in 15 column volumes.

563
564

Expression and purification of the HCoV-HKU1 Spike protein

565

293T cells were seeded on 60 cm2 dishes, cultured for 24 h at 37°C with 5% CO2 and

566

transfected with 25 μg of pSecTag2-HKU-S plasmid per dish using polyethyleneimine (Sigma

567

Aldrich, Poland). Cells were further cultured for 72 h at 37°C with 5% CO2 and collected for

568

HKU1-S purification. Cell pellets were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl,

569

1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.5) in the presence of Viscolase

570

(1250 U/ml; A&A Biotechnology, Poland), clarified by centrifugation, and filtered (0.45 µm

571

syringe PES filter). Supernatant containing 6 × His tagged S protein was mixed in 1:2 ratio with

572

binding buffer (20 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH = 7.4) and purified

573

using a fast performance liquid chromatography system (FPLC; AKTA, GE Healthcare,

574

Poland) with a Ni2+ HiTrap IMAC (2 × 1 ml) column (GE Healthcare, Poland) preequilibrated

575

with the binding buffer. The 6 × His tagged S protein was eluted with elution buffer (20 mM

576

NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, pH = 6.9). The control sample from mock-

577

transfected cells was prepared in the same manner. Fractions containing 6 × His tagged

578

S protein or the respective fractions from control purification were pooled and dialyzed against

579

phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 5% glycerol.

CleavEx screening assay and HKU1-S cleavage

582

A total of 15 ng of each CleavEx protein was incubated with 50, 250 and 500 nM

583

KLK13, respectively in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5. For the full-length Spike protein, fractions

584

containing purified HKU1-S or mock samples were incubated with 0.5, 1.0 or 5.0 μM KLK13,

585

respectively in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5. Samples were incubated at 37°C for 3 hours and

586

immediately halted with the addition of 50 mM DTT-supplemented SDS sample buffer (1:1),

587

boiled for 5 min, cooled on ice, and separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels alongside dual-color

588

Page Ruler Prestained Protein size markers (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Poland). The separated

589

proteins were then transferred onto a Westran S PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare, Poland) by

590

wet blotting (Bio-Rad, Poland) for 1 h, 100 Volts in transfer buffer: 25 mM Tris, 192 mM

591

glycine, 20% methanol at 4°C. The membranes were then blocked by overnight incubation (at

592

4°C) in TBS-Tween (0.1%) buffer supplemented with 5% skimmed milk (BioShop, Canada).

593

A horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-His tag antibody (1:25000 dilution; Sigma-Aldrich,

594

Poland) diluted in 5% skimmed milk / TBS-Tween (0.1%) was used to detect the His-tagged

595

HmuY proteins. The signal was developed using the Pierce ECL Western blotting substrate

596

(Thermo Scientific, Poland) and visualized using the ChemiDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad,

597

Identification of the cleavage site

600

A total of 10 µg S1/S2 CleavEx protein was incubated with 500 nM of KLK13 at 37°C

601

for 5 h. Next, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 mM DTT-supplemented SDS

602

sample buffer (1:1) and samples were immediately boiled for 5 min. The samples were then

603

separated on 10% polyacrylamide gel alongside the dual-color Page Ruler Prestained Protein

separated proteins were then electrotransferred onto a Western S PVDF membrane (GE

606

Healthcare, Poland) using the Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad, Poland). The

607

transfer was performed for 30 min at 15 V in transfer buffer (10 mM N-cyclohexyl-3-

608

aminopropanesulfonic acid , 10% methanol, pH 11). Following the transfer, the membrane was

609

stained with 0.025% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (BioShop, Poland) and the bands

610

of interest were sequenced via Edman degradation using a PPSQ-31A automatic protein

Figure 1. Up-regulation of several KLKs after HCoV-HKU1 infection in HAE.
HAE cultures were infected with HCoV-HKU1 (106 RNA copies per ml) or mock for 2 h at
32°C and cultured for 5 days. Cellular RNA was isolated, treated with DNase, reverse
transcribed and each KLKs mRNA was amplified using specific primers. The analysis was
performed two times using cells obtained from different donors, each time in triplicate. (A)
Amplified PCR products were resolved and detected in 1.5% (w:v) agarose gel in 1 × TAE
buffer. (B) The expression of each KLK comparing to β-actin control was assessed semiquantitively by densitometry and is presented as a log change of signal specific for KLKs
mRNA in HCoV-HKU1-infected cells, compared to the mock-infected cells. The experiment
was performed three times using cells from different donors, each time with three biological
replicates. For comparisons by Student’s t-test, *Indicates P < 0.05; ns, not significant.

Figure 4. RD cells expressing KLK13 are permissive for the HCoV-HKU1
pseudoviruses.
(A) RD cells were transduced with lentiviral vectors harboring the KLK13 gene (KLK13) or
empty vector (ctrl). The presence of KLK13 mRNA was evaluated in RD cells after blasticidin
selection; β-actin was used as an internal control. (B) RD cells were transduced with lentiviral
vectors harboring the TMPRSS2 gene (TMPRSS2) or empty vector (ctrl). After blasticidin
selection, cells were lysed and proteins were analyzed with SDS-PAGE. TMPRSS2 was
detected in RD cell lysates (50 μg of protein per lane) and HAE cultures lysate (25 μg of protein
per lane) using the specific antibody. (C) RD control (RD_ctrl), TMPRSS2-expressing
(RD_TMPRSS2) or KLK13-expressing (RD_KLK13) cells were transduced with HIV
pseudoviruses decorated with VSV-G protein (VSV-G), S-HKU1 glycoprotein (S-HKU1) or
control viruses without the fusion protein (ΔEnv). After 72 h at 37°C, the entry of pseudoviruses
was measured by means of luminescence signal in cell lysates. The assay was performed twice,
each time in triplicate, and average values with standard errors are presented. For comparisons
by Student’s t-test, **Indicates P < 0.005. (D) HAE cultures were inoculated with HIV
pseudoviruses harboring VSV-G control protein, S-HKU1 or control viruses without the fusion
protein (ΔEnv) in the presence of KLK13 inhibitor (10 μM) or DMSO. After 72 h at 37°C the
entry of pseudoviruses was measured by means of luminescence signal in cell lysates (RLUs
per ml of lysate sample). The assay was performed in duplicate, and average values with
standard errors are presented. Statistical significance was assessed with the Student’s t-test, and
the asterisk indicates P < 0.05.
