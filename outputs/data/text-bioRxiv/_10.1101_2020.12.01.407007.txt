Abstract

35

Sex differences in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been controversial and the

36

underlying mechanisms of COVID-19 sexual dimorphism remain understudied. Here we

37

inspected sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 positivity, hospitalization, admission to the

38

intensive care unit (ICU), sera immune profiling, and two single-cell RNA-sequencing

39

(snRNA-seq) profiles from nasal tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells

40

(PBMCs) of COVID-19 patients with varying degrees of disease severity. Our propensity

41

score-matching observations revealed that male individuals have a 29% increased

42

likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 positivity, with a hazard ration (HR) 1.32 (95% confidence

43

interval [CI] 1.18-1.48) for hospitalization and HR 1.51 (95% CI 1.24-1.84) for admission

44

to ICU. Sera from male patients at hospital admission had decreased lymphocyte count

45

and elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and neutrophils).

46

We found that SARS-CoV-2 entry factors, including ACE2, TMPRSS2, FURIN and

47

NRP1, have elevated expression in nasal squamous cells from males with moderate

48

and severe COVID-19. Cell-cell network proximity analysis suggests possible

49

epithelium-immune cell interactions and immune vulnerability underlying a higher

50

mortality in males with COVID-19. Monocyte-elevated expression of Toll like receptor 7

51

(TLR7) and Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is associated with severe outcomes in males

52

with COVID-19. These findings provide basis for understanding immune responses

53

underlying sex differences, and designing sex-specific targeted treatments and patient

54

care for COVID-19.

Introduction

57

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory

58

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), is a complex disorder with multisystem

59

involvement across different organs1-3. SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 9 million

60

people and 253,769 people have died in the United States (US) since December, 2019

61

(Johns Hopkins data on November 20, 2020). Approximately 14% of COVID-19 positive

62

patients show severe symptoms associated with advanced age1, sex4, genetics5,6,

63

disease comorbidities1, 7, and other risk factors. Yet, the mechanisms at the cellular and

64

molecular level underlying these risk factors remain unclear, especially for sex

65

differences impacting disease severity.

66

Sex differences in outcomes have been manifested in multiple infectious diseases,

67

such as influenza8, hepatitis A and C9 viruses, and human immunodeficiency virus 1

68

[HIV1]10, 11. In addition, HIV1 and hepatitis C virus generally show a higher viral loads in

69

men compared to women12. Moreover, women may mount higher immune responses to

70

viral infections and vaccination13. An epidemiologic survey from 1965 through 1997 in

71

the U.S. revealed that 80% of cases across 24 autoimmune diseases occurred in

72

women14. Furthermore, in healthy populations, males have an elevated abundance of

73

CD8+ T cells, whereas women have higher proportions of CD4+ T cells and B cells in

74

blood15, 16. These studies support the concept that sex differences in immune responses

75

may play crucial roles in the incidence, progression, and outcomes of some human

76

diseases, including COVID-194.

77
78

During the COVID-19 pandemic, men have shown higher rates of critical cases,
with a 6.6% increased mortality rate compare to women in the U.S. based on a report of

79

114,411 COVID-19-assosiatied deaths by the National Vital Statistics System from May

80

1 to August 31, 202017. Similar observations were also made in United Kingdom, where

81

males have a 1.78 hazard ratio of COVID-19-related deaths compared to females1.

82

Moreover, male COVID-19 patients have a higher percentage of non-classical

83

monocytes and elevated IL-8 and IL-18 levels in plasma4. Owing to heterogeneity of

84

immune cells in the human body, the detailed genetic basis and molecular mechanism

85

of sex differences that can explain the sex-specific risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and

86

disease severity remains unknown. Sex differences in immune responses in COVID-19

87

have a direct impact on the efficacy of vaccination and immune-related treatments.

88

Hence, there is a pressing need to better understand the sex-specific heterogeneity of

89

cell subpopulations of the human immune systems and its role in the severity of COVID-

90

19.

91

In this study, we investigated sex differences in COVID-19 outcomes by

92

combining observations from large-scale patient data from a COVID-19 registry and

93

multimodal single-cell omics analysis of COVID-19 patient samples with varying

94

degrees of disease severity. We identified that male patients have a higher susceptibility

95

to severe COVID-19 using Propensity Score (PS)-adjusted observational analyses. By

96

analysis of available laboratory testing data, we found that male patients had a lower

97

level of circulating lymphocytes and elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein,

98

procalcitonin, and neutrophils) compared to female patients with COVID-19. We further

99

performed multimodal single-cell omics data analysis of nasal tissues and peripheral

100

blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from COVID-19 patient blood to identify

101

differential cell subpopulations contributing to sex differences of human immune

102

responses. In summary, this study provides novel immunological mechanisms for the

103

observed male bias in COVID-19 severity, which may offer individualized approaches

104

for the prevention and treatment of male and female patients with COVID-19 in a sex-

105

specific manner.

Results

108

Sex differences of COVID-19 outcomes influenced by age

109

In total, 27,659 individuals (8,361 COVID-19 positive) were tested between March 8 and

110

July 27, 2020 within the Cleveland Clinic Health System in Ohio and Florida (Table 1).

111

We observed that demographic factors (including age and race) were significantly

112

different between females and males in the total cohort of the COVID-19 positive

113

subgroup (Table 1). We found that female and male individuals have different

114

percentage of comorbidities relevant to proven severity of COVID-191, 7, including

115

smoking (p < 0.001, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test), diabetes (p < 0.001), hypertension (p

116

< 0.001 ), and coronary artery disease (p < 0.001). Interestingly, the fraction of COVID-

117

19 positive females (n = 4,680, 56.0%) was higher than males (n = 3,681, 44.0%, p <

118

0.001, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test). We found that the sex difference in the occurrence

119

of SARS-CoV-2 tested positive differed by age. For example, the prevalence of COVID-

120

19 positivity greater in females than in males only in the age groups older than 80 years

121

(80-90 years p = 0.006 and > 90 years p = 0.029, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test,

122

Supplementary Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). One possible explanation of

123

overall high incidence of COVID-19 positive patients in female individuals (56.0%)

124

compared to male individuals (44.0%) is that females have longer lifespan than males18.

125

We found that 26% of male patients (n = 957, p < 0.001, two-tailed Fisher’s exact

126

test) compared to 19% (n=889) females were hospitalized for COVID-19; 9.9% (n =

127

365, p < 0.001, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test) of male patients compared to 5.2% (245)

128

females were in intensive care units (ICU); and 4.7% (n=174, p < 0.001, two-tailed

129

Fisher’s exact test) of male patients versus 2.1% (n=99) of females had to be

130

mechanically ventilated in the ICU. Specifically, the male-predominant risks of

131

hospitalization and ICU stay occurred in COVID-19 patients aged 50 to 90 years. The

132

male predominance in COVID-19 disease severity is underscored further by the female

133

predominance of COVID-19 infections over the age of 79 (Supplementary Fig. 1a and

134

Supplementary Table 1).

135
136

Sex is significantly associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes

137

We used an adjusted odds ratio (OR) to evaluate the associations between sex

138

differences and COVID-19 outcomes after adjusting confounding factors using a

139

propensity score matching approach. In total, we investigated four types of COVID-19

140

outcomes: (i) the SARS-CoV-2 positive rate by real-time reverse transcription

141

polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), ii) hospitalization, iii) ICU admission, and (iv)

142

whether the patients had to use mechanical ventilation in the ICU setting. To reduce risk

143

of confounding factors, we adjusted for age, race, smoking, and four types of disease

144

comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] &

145

emphysema, and coronary artery disease) based on our sizeable efforts, using the PS

146

matching method (see Methods). We found that male individuals were significantly

147

associated with an increased likelihood of a positive laboratory test results by RT-PCR

148

for SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18 – 1.41, Fig. 1a), COVID-

149

19-related hospitalization (OR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.32 – 1.85), ICU admission (OR = 1.98,

150

95% CI 1.47 – 2.68), and requirement for mechanical ventilation (OR = 1.75, 95% CI

151

1.15 – 2.66) after adjusting for potential confounding factors. These observations

152

together suggest that male individuals have an elevated incidence of SARS-CoV-2

153

infection and a higher likelihood of severe COVID-19 outcomes compared to females.

154

To better evaluate the hazard of sex differences on COVID-19 clinical outcomes,

155

we performed Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate the cumulative hazard between males

156

and females for admission to hospital and ICU (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1b).

157

Male patients who tested positive for COVID-19 had a higher cumulative hazard for

158

hospitalization than female patients using both PS-matching (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.32,

159

95% CI 1.18 – 1.48, p < 1.5 x10-6, Log-rank, Fig 1b) and non-PS-matching methods

160

(HR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.10 – 1.56, p < 1.9 x10-14, Log-rank, Supplementary Fig. 1b). We

161

found male patients had a longer duration of hospitalization than female patients (mean

162

[±SD], 7.6 [±7.8] days versus [vs.] 6.2 [±6.7] days, p = 0.012, Kolmogorov–Smirnov

163

[KS] test, Fig 1c). More specifically, males with COVID-19 also have a higher

164

cumulative hazard for ICU admission compared to females (HR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.24-

165

1.84, p < 2.0 x10-16, PS-matching Log-rank test, Fig 1b). The average duration of ICU

166

stays for male patients was 8.2 (SD = ±8.9) days, which is significantly longer than 6.2

167

(SD = ± 7.2) days for female patients (p = 0.015, Fig 1c). Altogether, our analysis

168

suggests that male individuals are significantly associated with severe COVID-19

169

outcomes compared to female individuals.

171

Sex-biased COVID-19 severity is associated with immune responses

172

Hyperinflammation has been reported as a major factor predisposing to a higher

173

mortality in severe COVID-19 patients19 and there is a well-established sex difference in

174

immune responses13. We next interrogated sex differences in inflammation-related

175

clinical variables available in the COVID-19 registry. We found that the peripheral

176

lymphocyte count was significantly lower in hospitalized male patients (p = 1.3x10-7,

177

Kolmogorov–Smirnov [KS] test, Fig 1d) than in hospitalized females. In contrast, the

178

circulating neutrophil levels in hospitalized male patients were higher than that of female

179

patients (p = 0.039, Fig 1d). In addition, two other inflammatory parameters, C-reactive

180

protein and procalcitonin, were significantly elevated in hospitalized males compare to

181

females (p = 8.3x10-9 and 2.5x10-8, Fig 1d). Together, these observations reveal that

182

the male-biased inflammatory responses are potentially associated with severe COVID-

183

19. Yet, the underlying mechanisms of male-biased inflammatory responses for COVID-

184

19 patients remain unknown. We therefore turned our attention to investigate this

185

COVID-19 sexual-dimorphism in human immune systems using multimodal single-cell

186

omics analysis.

187
188

Sex-biased cell subpopulations in nasal tissues of critical COVID-19 cases

189

We investigated the single-cell RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) profiles of nasal tissues

190

in the upper airway from COVID-19 positive patients vs. healthy donors (Fig. 2a). The

191

samples comprised 11 critical COVID-19 patients, 8 moderate COVID-19 patients, and

192

5 healthy donors (Supplementary Table 2), as described in a previous study20. The

193

snRNA-seq dataset contains 135,600 cells (Fig. 2a) across 22 annotated cell types

194

within two main cell populations: epithelial cells (9 cell types) and immune cells (13 cell

195

types, Fig. 2b).

196

From the analysis of relative proportions of each cell type, we observed that cell

197

populations are significantly different between male and female patients with COVID-19

198

(Fig. 2b). Compared to the female patients with critical COVID-19, male patients with

199

critical COVID-19 have a significantly elevated abundances across five epithelial cell

200

types: the ciliated-diff (ciliated-differentiating, p < 2.0 x 10-16, Fisher test), FOXN4 (p =

201

6.1 x 10-5), secretory (p < 2.0 x 10-16), secretory-diff (secretory-differentiating, p < 2.0 x

202

10-16), and squamous cells (p < 2.0 x 10-16). For immune cells, male patients with critical

203

COVID-19 have elevated abundances of CTL (Cytotoxic T cell, p < 2.0 x 10-16) and

204

nrMa (non-resident macrophage, p < 2.0 x 10-16) compared to female patients (Fig. 2b).

205

In contrast, the abundances of Treg (regulatory T cell, p < 2.0 x 10-16), NK (natural killer,

206

p = 1.2 x 10-7), pDC (plasmacytoid dendritic cell, p < 2.0 x 10-16), and rMa (resident

207

macrophage, p < 2.0 x 10-16) were decreased in critically ill male patients compared to

208

critically ill females. These observations suggest that the differential epithelial and

209

immune cell subpopulations between males and females may provide a possible

210

explanation for the observed male-biased higher mortality in COVID-19 critical patients.

211
212

Male-biased transcriptional networks in nasal tissues of critical COVID-19

213

We next sought to identify gene expression changes in sex-biased cell subpopulations

214

from nasal tissues with varying degrees of COVID-19 severity. In each cell type, we

215

defined the over-expressed genes between males vs. females (fold change [FC] > 1,

216

FDR < 0.05, Supplementary Fig 2a) as the male-biased gene set; the female-biased

217

gene set is the down-regulated genes in males vs. females (FC < 1, FDR < 0.05). We

218

used the gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to evaluate the 22 immune pathways at

219

single-cell levels (Supplementary Fig 2a, see Method). We defined a cell type that has

220

sex-biased differentially expressed genes enriched in at least one immune pathway

221

(FDR > 0.05, Supplementary Table 3) as a sex-biased, immune perturbing cell type

222

(Fig 2c). We found heterogeneous immune perturbing cell types for female patients

223

across healthy donors, moderate and critical COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2c). Yet, we only

224

found the elevated immune perturbing cell types for male patients with moderate and

225

critical COVID-19 patients, but not for healthy donors. Compared to female patients, we

226

identified 9 male-biased immune perturbing cell types for critical COVID-19, including

227

squamous, ciliated-diff, secretory-diff, pDC, Treg, rMa, B cell, Neu and NK. Specifically,

228

we found that 86% (19/22) of immune pathways were significantly enriched in sex-

229

biased differentially expressed genes of rMa cells (FDR< 0.05) in male patients with

230

critical COVID-19, including the IL-17 signaling pathway, cytokines and growth factors,

231

antigen processing and presentation, Th17 cell differentiation, and Th1 and Th2 cell

232

differentiation (Fig. 2c).

233

We further inspected network-based relationships of different immune cell types for

234

sex-biased differentially expressed genes using network proximity measures, as

235

described in our previous studies21, 22. We quantified network-based relationships using

236

z-scores for sex-biased differentially expressed genes under the human protein-protein

237

interactome network model for different immune cell types. We found spare cell-cell

238

interaction networks for sex-biased differentially expressed genes in healthy donors

239

between males and females (Fig. 2d). However, dense cell-cell interaction networks

240

were observed for both male- and female-biased genes in moderate COVID-19

241

patients. Yet, we found much denser cell-cell interaction networks for male-biased

242

differentially expressed genes in critical COVID-19 compared to female patients (Fig.

243

2d). In particular, we found that rMa and Treg were highly connected with several

244

epithelial cell types, including squamous, secretory-diff, and ciliated-diff cell types,

245

suggesting possible epithelium-immune cell interactions underlying sex differences of

246

COVID-19. Taken together, both bioinformatics and network-based analysis revealed

247

cell type-specific, male-biased transcriptional network activities for COVID-19 severity,

248

such as epithelium-immune cell interactions.

249
250

Activated squamous cells in males upon SARS-CoV-2 infection

251

Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells depends on the expression level of the surface

252

receptor ACE2 as well as S protein priming proteases23, including TMPRSS224,

253

FURIN25 and NPR126. Yet, the expression levels of ACE2 with either one of the S-

254

priming proteases were unclear at single-cell levels between male and female

255

individuals. We found that the epithelial cells had a higher expression of ACE2 than

256

immune cells in both males and females (Supplementary Fig 3a). We found that

257

ACE2, as well as TMPRSS2 and FURIN, have an elevated expression levels in

258

squamous cells from males than from female patients with both moderate and critical

259

COVID-19 (Fig 3a and Supplementary Fig 3b). Fig 3b shows that ACE2 is

260

significantly co-expressed with TMPRSS2 (p < 2.0x10-16), FURIN (p < 2.0x10-16) and

261

NPR1 (p = 2.3x10-6) in squamous cells from male patients with critical COVID-19

compared to female critical patients (Fig 3b).

263

We further performed GSEA analysis for male-biased gene set of squamous cells

264

from patients with critical COVID19. We found that squamous cells from critically ill male

265

patients were significantly enriched for 3 immune pathways (Fig 2c), including the IL-17

266

signaling pathway (FDR = 0.001), cytokines and growth factors (FDR = 0.001), as well

267

as antigen processing and presentation (FDR = 0.047). We next turned to identify

268

network modules (defined by the largest connect component [LCC] in the human

269

interactome) for the male-biased immune gene set (up-regulated immune genes in

270

males compared to females) of squamous cells. We found that male-biased immune

271

genes significantly formed LCC (p = 0.04, permutation test, Fig 3c) in the human

272

protein-protein interactome network. From the male-specific immune network of

273

squamous cells, the sub-network of the IL-17 signaling pathway (red nodes) was highly

274

connected to other immunological pathways. The proteins in the IL-17 signaling

275

pathway were highly connected to the proteins in the antigen processing and

276

presentation pathway through JUN, which was a male-biased transcription factor

277

reported in Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database27. TAB3 is an activator of

278

JUN in the IL-17 signaling pathway, and the RNA expression levels of TAB3 (q =

279

7.5x10-9) is increased in squamous in male patients with critical COVID-19 (Fig 3c-d).

280

We found that TAB3 is an X chromosome-link (X-link) inactivated gene27, and 93% of

281

TAB3 expression are inactivated by XCI (X chromosome inactivation) in females28.

282

These findings suggest that random X chromosome activation may explain some of the

283

sex differences of COVID-19 disease severity in male and female individuals.

284
285

Notably, JUN and NFKB1 were enriched among male-biased genes in the GTEx
database revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing in promoter regions27.

286

Compared to the female patients, JUN and NFKB1 were highly expressed, with a

287

broader distribution in squamous cells of male patients compared to females with critical

288

COVID-19 (Fig 3d and Supplementary Fig3c). JUN and NFKB1 were found to induce

289

the expression of multiple proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and their receptors in

290

male squamous, including IFNGR1, IFNGR2, TGFB2, CXCL2 and IL18 (Fig 3c-d and

291

Supplementary Fig 3c). We also found that the increased proinflammatory cytokines

292

(IFNGR1, IFNGR2 and TGFB2) were significantly co-expressed with ACE2 in male

293

squamous cells from critically ill COVID-19 patients (Fig 3e). Altogether, these

294

observations suggest that squamous cells play crucial roles in male-biased mortality for

295

critical COVID-19 patients. Further independent cohort validation and functional

296

observations are highly warranted.

297
298

Male-biased immune cell subpopulations in PBMCs from severe COVID-19 cases

299

To understand the sex-specific host immune responses at the single-cell level, we

300

utilized PBMC single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets from COVID-19 patients (n = 9) and

301

healthy donors (n = 4, Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 2). In total, we re-analyzed

302

49,054 cells and clustered them to 13 annotated cell types based on well-defined maker

303

genes (Supplementary Fig 4) and 3 un-annotated cell types (see Methods) from a

304

recent study (see Methods).

305

We identified multiple, sex-specific differential immune cell types from PBMCs

306

across healthy controls, mild and severe COVID-19 patients (Fig 2b and 4b).

307

Compared to female COVID-19 patients, the male patients with severe and mild

308

COVID-19 had significantly elevated abundances of monocytes-nC (non-classic

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.01.407007; this version posted December 1, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

309

monocytes, p < 2.0 x 10-16 [mild] and p = 3.7 x 10-5 [severe], Fig 4b). In parallel, we

310

found that male patients in the severe COVID-19 group have higher abundances of B

311

cells (lgG- [lgG non-expressed B cell], p = 4.7 x 10-11 and lgG+ [lgG expressed B cell], p

312

= 1.7 x 10-9) and CD4-T EM (effector memory like CD4 T cells, p = 1.3 x 10-9) but lower

313

abundances of CD4-T nEM cells (non-effector memory like CD4 T cells, p = 1.1 x 10-7)

314

and DC cells (p = 0.016).

315

We further used the GSEA method to evaluate the immune pathway activities

316

based on male/female-biased gene sets identified from snRNA-seq data of PBMCs

317

(Supplementary Fig 2a and Supplementary Table 4). We found that more cell types

318

were significantly enriched by immune pathways in PBMCs from male patients with

319

severe COVID-19 compared to females (Fig. 4c). Yet, fewer cell types were enriched

320

by immune pathways in PBMCs of male healthy donors compared to healthy females

321

(DC, monocyte, monocyte-nC, CD4-T cell nEM/EM, CD8-T cell EM, B cell lgG-/+ and

322

NK). These results suggest that male patients may have more significant immune

323

responses than females after SARS-CoV-2 infection. It should be pointed out that 14

324

immune pathways were significantly enriched in monocytes (FDR< 0.05) from male

325

patients with severe COVID-19 (Fig. 4c), such as Toll-like receptor signaling pathways,

326

RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, cytokines and growth factors, and the IL-17

327

signaling pathway. Yet, in female severe COVID-19 patients, only the complement and

328

coagulation pathways were significantly enriched in the monocytes (FDR = 0.003).

329

We next inspected the cell-cell network relationships of PBMCs from both male

330

and female patients across healthy controls, mild and severe COVID-19 patients. Using

331

network proximity measure, we found a similar cell-cell interaction network for female

332

patients with mild and severe COVID-19 (Fig 4d and Supplementary Fig 5a). Yet,

333

male patients with severe COVID-19 significantly have the elevated immune cell-cell

334

interactions compared to males with mild COVID-19, revealing possible immune

335

vulnerability associated with male-biased high mortality in severe COVID-19. For

336

example, monocyte-activated immune responses were predominantly observed in cell-

337

cell interaction networks of male-derived PBMCs with severe COVID-19 compared to

338

female patients (Fig 4d). In summary, both bioinformatics and network analyses

339

suggest that immune vulnerability may be associated with male-biased morbidity and

340

mortality in severe COVID-19, such as elevated monocyte-related immune responses.

341
342

Elevated monocyte immune responses in male patients with severe COVID-19

343

We further performed human protein-protein interactome network analysis to investigate

344

the immune characteristics of monocytes in male patients with severe COVID-19. We

345

found that the male-biased gene set (up-regulated genes in male monocytes vs. female

346

monocytes) formed the significant network module (Fig 5a, p < 0.001, Permutation test)

347

in the human interactome. This male-biased, monocyte-specific protein-protein

348

interaction network was significantly enriched by several key immune pathways,

349

including Toll-like receptor pathway (gold), IL-17 signaling pathway (red), cytokines and

350

growth factors (blue), and antigen processing and presentation (green) (Fig 5a).

351

Several hub genes (including JUN, NFKB1, CCR1 and SATA1) are highly connected

352

among different immune pathways. Specifically, the expression level of JUN and

353

NFKB1 in monocytes is significantly increased in male patients with severe COVID-19

354

patients compared to females (q < 2.0 x 10-16).

355

We next selected genes using subject matter expertise based on a combination of

356

factors: a) sex-biased expression in GETx, b) available eQTL data, c) well-annotated

357

immune genes from KEGG database29, and d) available evidences of X-link genes.

358

Applying these criteria resulted in two top-predicted sex-based genes, including Toll-like

359

receptor 7 (TLR7) and Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), which may explain the disease

360

severity of COVID-19. Both TLR7 and BTK are X-link inactive genes. Specifically, 84%

361

of TLR7 and 98% BTK expression are inactivated by XCI in females28. A recently study

362

found that BTK was associated with one SNP rs2071223 in male lymphocytes (p =

363

0.005)27. In a case series of 4 young men with severe COVID-19, rare putative loss-of-

364

function variant (c.2129_2132del) of TLR7 were reported to be associated with impaired

365

type I and II IFN responses30. We found that TLR7 (q = 8.9x10-8) and BTK expression (q

366

= 0.001) in monocytes are significantly increased in male patients with severe COVID-

367

19 compared to females (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, the downstream factors of TLR7 and

368

BTK in Toll-like receptor pathway, such as MYD88, IRF7, NFKB1, JUN, and cytokines

369

TNF, IL1B, IL18 were also found to be significantly increased in male patients with

370

severe COVID-19 (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig 5b). Altogether, monocyte-specific

371

expression of TLR7 and BTK may provide potential explanations for the male-biased

372

disease severity in COVID-19.

Discussion

376

In this study, we comprehensively investigated the sex differences in disease severity

377

and mortality between male and female individuals using an integrative approach that

378

integrates large-scale COVID-19 patient registry, multimodal analysis of snRNA-seq

379

profiles, and human protein-protein interactome network analysis. We identified that

380

male patients with COVID-19 had a higher rate of hospitalization and ICU admission,

381

and a longer stay time in hospital or ICU, compared to female individuals (Fig. 1). Our

382

finding is consistent with an observational study using 17 million COVID-19 tested

383

populations: males individuals had 1.78 hazard for COVID-19 related death compared

384

to female individuals1.

385

Via analysis of laboratory testing data in the COVID-19 patient registry database, we

386

found that serum of male patients has elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive

387

protein, procalcitonin, and neutrophil) compared to female patients with COVID-19,

388

suggesting sex-specific immune responses underlying sex differences between male

389

and female individuals with COVID-19. We further performed multimodal analysis of

390

single-cell RNA-sequencing data from both nasal tissues and PBMCs with varying

391

degrees of COVID-19 pathology. We identified several sex-biased, differential immune

392

cell types and gene transcriptional networks that may provide explanations for the

393

higher mortality in male patients with severe COVID-19. For example, network proximity

394

analysis of sex-biased, differentially expressed genes in the human protein-protein

395

interactome show potential epithelium-immune cell interactions from nasal tissues and

396

immune vulnerability from PBMCs underlying male-biased high mortality for COVID-19.

397

ACE2, a key SARS-CoV-2 receptor in host cells23, 31, together with the S-protein

398

priming proteases TMPRSS2, FURIN and NPR1, facilitate viral entry into the human

399

upper respiratory tract24-26. High expression levels of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and FURIN is

400

predicted to results in an enhanced efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 infection and greater

401

severity of COVID-1920. Aligned with the observation of COVID-19 severity, we found

402

that several SARS-CoV-2 entry factors, including ACE2, TMPRSS2, FURIN and NRP1,

403

have elevated expression in nasal squamous cells of male individuals with both

404

moderate and severe COVID-19, but not in females (Fig 3 and Supplementary Fig

405

3b). This finding may provide a possible explanation for the 29% increased likelihood of

406

SARS-CoV-2 infection in men vs. women in our COVID-19 registry (Fig. 1a). In

407

addition, we found that ACE2 was significantly co-expressed with multiple innate

408

immune genes (including JUN, IFNGR1, TGFB2, CXCL2, IL18, and IL23A) in

409

nasal/respiratory squamous cells from male patients with severe COVID-19. All these

410

findings imply that sex-biased, differential epithelium cell subpopulations (Figs 2b and

411

4b) and transcriptional network changes (Figs 2d and 4d) may contribute to higher

412

incidence in male patients with severe COVID-19 compared to female individuals.

413

A recent study showed that the myeloid cell dysregulation was a marker for severe

414

COVID-19 diaease32, 33. In our current study, we found that differential transcriptomes in

415

the rMa of nasal tissue and PBMCs were significantly enriched in multiple immune

416

pathways (Fig. 2c and Fig. 4c) in male patients with severe COVID-19. These findings

417

provide a potential explanation as so why that male COVID-19 patients often have a

418

stronger likelihood of increased morbidity (1.32 HR in hospital and 1.51 HR in ICU, Fig1

419

b) and a higher mortality than female patients.

420

TLR7 and BTK are male-biased, differentially expressed genes in peripheral

421

monocytes of male patients with severe COVID-19. TLR7 escapes the XCI in female B

422

cell, resulting in the higher expression levels in women than in men34. Young men with

423

severe COVID-19 were found to carry the 4-nucleotide deletion in TLR7

424

(c.2129_2132del; pGln710Argfs*18), while the affected family members carried only

425

one missense variant on TLR7 (c.2383G>T; pVal795Phe)30. This evidence supports the

426

potential role of TLR7 in the male-associated higher mortality seen in severe COVID-19

427

patients (Fig. 5b). BTK, a tyrosine kinase, was identified as a top male-biased,

428

differentially expressed gene in monocytes of severe COVID-19 patients. BTK is an X-

429

linked gene and 98% of its expression is inactivated by XCI28 in females. By analyzing

430

gene expression profiles of 838 subjects from the GETx database, we found that an

431

eQTL SNP (rs2071223) on BTK in male-derived lymphocytes (p = 0.005)27 but not

432

female, further supporting the male-specific role of BTK in COVID-19. Several BTK

433

inhibitors (e.g., acalabrutinib and ibruitinib, which blocks TLR7-dependent NF-κB

434

activation in monocytes), have been shown to be potentially promising in treatment of

435

patients with severe COVID-19. Altogether, these observations emphasize that sex is a

436

key biological variable which should be considered in predicting the efficacy of

437

pharmacologic treatments (such as BTK inhibitors) in people diagnosed with COVID-19.

438

We acknowledge several potential limitations of our study. Samples sizes of

439

snRNA-seq datasets analyzed in this study are relatively small; and the smaller number

440

of female patients compared to males may influence the findings of differential cell

441

subpopulation analysis. Thus, the sex-biased cell types and transcriptional networks we

442

identified should be validated further in prospective large-scale cohorts with varying

443

degrees of COVID-19 pathology, including asymptomatic patients. In addition, we

444

observed that the male patients aged between 30 to 80 years have a greater risk of

445

infection by SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig 1a), but in the group of females aged 80

446

years or older females had a higher prevalence of confirmed SARS-COV-2 infections.

447

Exploring the sex differences and underlying immune mechanisms in younger COVID-

448

19 patients, including the pediatric population, may provide more actionable biomarkers

449

and immune targets for disease prevention and vaccine development35, 36. Finally,

450

genetic basis of sex differences should be investigated in the future using the genetic

451

datasets from the growing COVID-19 population, such as the genome-wide association

452

studies from COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative37 (https://www.covid19hg.org/).

453

Taken together, our analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the

454

clinical characteristics and immune mechanisms underlying sex differences in COVID-

455

19. We found that male individuals with COVID-19 have significantly elevated rates of

456

hospitalization and ICU admission, and longer stay times in hospital or ICU. Laboratory

457

testing variable observation, bioinformatics and network-based analyses of single-cell

458

data from nasal tissues and PBMCs provide possible immunological explanations for

459

the identified male-biased severity and higher mortality in COVID-19. If broadly applied,

460

these findings will offer a path toward sex-specific molecularly targeted therapeutic

461

development for COVID-19, which will be essential against the COVID-19 pandemic

462

and future pandemics from other emerging pathogens.

27,659 individuals (8,274 positive) tested during March to July, 2020 from the Cleveland

469

Clinic Health System in Florida and Ohio. All tested samples were pooled

470

nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens. Then the infection with SARS-

471

CoV-2 was confirmed by RT-PCR in the Cleveland Clinic Robert J. Tomsich Pathology

472

and Laboratory Medicine Institute. All SARS-CoV-2 testing was authorized by the Food

473

and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization and accord with the

474

guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

475

The data in COVID-19 registry include COVID-19 test results, baseline

476

demographic information, medications, and all recorded disease conditions and others.

477

We conducted a series of retrospective studies to test the sex difference with four

478

COVID-19 outcomes, COVID-19 test positive. Data were extracted from electronic

479

health records (EPIC Systems) and were manually checked by a study team trained on

480

uniform sources for the study variables. We collected and managed all patient data

481

using REDCap electronic data capture tools. The statistical analysis for smoking,

482

diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] & emphysema

483

and coronary artery disease were calculated after missing value deletion.

outcomes: i) COVID-19 positive outcome: COVID-19 positive patients (n = 8361) were

489

Hospitalization outcome: hospitalized patients (n = 1,846) were matched to non-

490

hospitalized patients (n = 6,515) in COVID-19 positive patients; iii) ICU admission

491

outcome: the patients of ICU admission (n = 610) were matched to non-ICU admission

492

patients (n = 1,236) but they were in hospital due to COVID-19; iv) ICU mechanical

493

ventilator: the COVID-19 patients used mechanical ventilator (n = 273) were matched to

494

non- mechanical ventilator user (n = 337) in ICU. To reduce the bias from confounding

495

factors, all PS-matched patients were adjusted for age, race, smoking, presence of

496

diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] & emphysema

497

and coronary artery disease. The PS-matched groups were used to the next clinical

498

analysis. The PS-matching analyses were conducted by matchit package in the R

499

v3.6.3 platform.

500
501

Clinical outcome analysis

502

The odds ratio (OR) was used to measure the association between the COVDI-19

503

outcomes and sex based on logistic regression model. An OR > 1 means that male sex

504

is associated with a higher likelihood of the outcome. The Kaplan-Meier method was

505

used to estimate cumulative hazard of hospitalization and ICU-admission of COVID-19

506

positive patients by sex. And Cox proportional regression model was used to quantified

507

the hazard of sex for COVID-19 outcomes. For hospitalization outcome, the time was

508

calculated from the start date of COVID-19 symptom onset to hospital admission date.

509

For ICU admission outcome, the time was calculated from the date of patients admitted

510

to hospital to the date of ICU admission. Log-rank test was used for comparison among

511

different sex with BH (Benjamini & Hochberg) adjustment38. All the cumulative hazard

512

analyses were performed using the Survival and Survminer packages in R 3.6.0

513

(https://www.r-project.org).

Single-cell RNA-seq data analysis

517

In this study we used two single-cell datasets of COVID-19 patients versus healthy

518

control20 (Supplementary Table 2). i) Dataset-1 (European Genome-phenome Archive

519

repository: EGAS00001004481), it was collected nasopharyngeal and pharyngeal

520

tissues from COVID-19 positive patients (11 severe patients with 3:8 female vs. male

521

ratio, and 8 mild patients with 1:7 female vs. male ratio) and healthy control (5 healthy

522

donors with 3:2 female vs. male ratio). The dataset contains 135,600 cells with cell type

523

annotated. Therefore, all analysis in dataset-1 were based on their cell type annotation.

524

ii) Dataset-2 (GSE149689)39 was downloaded from the NCBI GEO database. This data

525

set included three groups, patients infected influenza A, COVID-19 and healthy controls.

526

But we only focus on COVID-19 and healthy control population in this study. For the

527

COVID-19 group, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) samples were

528

collected from 4 severe patients (1:1 female vs. male ratio) and 5 mild patients (3:2

529

female vs. male ratio). In addition, 4 donors in healthy control group with 3:1 ratio in

530

female vs. male. In total, 49,053 cells were used to next analysis. Qualifying cells based

531

on the criteria from the original paper were used for the single cell analysis. We used

532

the cell type gene markers from a previous study39 (CD3E, CD4, CCR7, CD8A, NCAM1,

533

CD14, FCGR3A, NR4A1, CD19, FCER1A, PPBP and HBB, Supplementary Fig. 4b).

534

All single-cell data analyses and visualizations were performed with the R package

535

Seurat v3.1.4 40. “NormalizeData” was used to normalize the data.

536

“FindIntegrationAnchors” and “IntegrateData” functions were used to integrate cells from

537

different samples. tSNE was used as the dimension reduction method for visualization.

Sex specific differences in gene expression by cell types

542

The sex specific expressed gene sets were defined as the differentially expressed

543

genes in each cell type of of male vs. female. edgeR41 v 3.12 was used to computing

544

the differential expression genes in different cell types based on R platform 4.0. Male

545

specific gene sets of each cell type were defined as significantly up-regulated genes of

546

males vs. females (log2 fold change > 0 and FDR < 0.05, Supplementary Fig 2a), and

547

female specific gene sets in each cell type were defined as the significantly down-

548

regulated genes in males vs. females (log2 fold change < 0 and FDR < 0.05).

549
550

Immune gene set enrichment analysis

551

To evaluated the immune pathway activity in female and male, GSEA was conducted as

552

described in previous work42. The immune gene profiles were retrieved from KEGG

553

database29. We selected 22 immune related pathways and 1241 genes from KEGG

554

belonging to the immune system subtype. The normalized enrichment score (NES,

555

Equation 1) was calculated for 22 immune pathways in male and female specific gene

556

sets (Supplementary Fig 2a). The equation is shown as follows:

557

"#

NES = $%&'("#) &+&,')- &.. /%0$1-&-12') 23 4&-&)%-)

(1)

558

where ES42 denotes enrichment score. Through normalizing the enrichment score,

559

GSEA avoid the differences in gene set size and in correlations between gene sets and

560

the expression dataset. For male gene sets of this study, we only selected NES > 0 and

561

FDR < 0.05 pathways as male activated immune pathways. For female gene sets, we

562

only selected NES < 0 and FDR < 0.05 pathways as the female activated immune

563

pathways. Permutation test (1000 times) was performed to evaluate the significance. All

564

analyses were performed with the prerank function in GSEApy package

565

(https://gseapy.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html) on Python 3.7 platform.

566
567

Functional enrichment analysis

568

We performed KEGG enrichment analyses to reveal the biological relevance and

569

functional pathways. All functional enrichment analyses were performed using Enrichr43.

570

And the FDR < 0.05 as significantly enriched pathways.

572

Building the human protein-protein interactome

573

To build a comprehensive human interactome, we assembled in total 18 bioinformatics

574

and systems biology databases to collect PPIs with five types of experimental

575

evidences: (1) literature-curated PPIs identified by affinity purification followed by mass

576

spectrometry (AP-MS), Y2H, literature-derived low-throughput experiments, or protein

577

three-dimensional structures from BioGRID44,IntAct45, Instruct46, MINT47, PINA v2.048

578

and InnateDB49; (2) binary PPIs tested by high-throughput yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H)

579

systems from two public available high-quality Y2H datasets50, 51 and one in-house

580

dataset52; (3) kinase-substrate interactions by literature-derived low-throughput or high-

581

throughput experiments from Kinome NetworkX53, Human Protein Resource Database

582

(HPRD)54, PhosphositePlus55, PhosphoNetworks56, Phospho.ELM57 and DbPTM 3.058;

583

(4) signaling network by literature-derived low-throughput experiments from SignaLink

584

2.059; and (5) protein complexes data identified by a robust affinity purification-mass

585

spectrometry methodology collected from BioPlex v2.060. The final human protein-

586

protein interactome used in this study included 351,444 unique PPIs (edges or links)

587

connecting 17,706 proteins (nodes). The detailed description for building human

588

protein-protein interactome are provided in our recent studies21, 22, 61.

589
590

Cell-cell proximity measure

591

We used the “shortest” network proximity metric to evaluate the cell-cell interactions in

592

male and female. First, we generated the sex specific gene set, which defined as

593

significant differential expression genes by male vs. female in each cell type (FDR <

594

0.05, Supplementary Fig 2a). Since the sizes of the gene sets vary largely, we

595

selected the top 200 differentially expressed genes based on the fold change for the

596

gene sets that have more than 200 genes. Next, for two gene sets 𝐴 and 𝐵, their

597

“shortest” network proximity 𝑑9: was calculated as:

598

<

𝑑9: = ‖9‖×‖:‖ ∑&∈9,D∈: 𝑑(𝑎, 𝑏)

(2)

599

where 𝑑 (𝑎, 𝑏) is the shortest distance of 𝑎 and 𝑏 in the human interactome. To evaluate

600

the significance of the proximity, we performed a permutation test repeated 1,000 times

601

using semi-randomly selected genes/proteins that have similar degree distributions to

602

the two gene sets being evaluated. We then calculated the Z score as:

603

𝑍4FG =

604
605

𝑑9: − III
𝑑0
𝜎0

(3)

where III
𝑑0 and 𝜎0 were the mean and standard deviation of the permutation test.

Identification of cell type-specific, sex-biased immune gene networks

607

We picked the overlap genes between sex specific differential genes set and 1241

608

immune genes (22 immune pathway from KEGG) as sex-biased immune gene set for

609

each cell type. In addition, we identified some immune genes as highly confidential sex-

610

bias genes based on the following criteria: 1) the genes were X-chromosome linked

611

genes from GTEx and public literature. 2) Sex-biased transcription factors and other

612

genes in specific tissues or cell types from GTEx database. 3) the genes were

613

significantly associated with sex-biased eQTL in specific tissues or cell types (the solid

614

tissues which majority cell type are epithelial cell, blood and lymphocytes). Thereafter,

615

we picked largest connected component from sex-biased immune gene set based on

616

PPIs as final sex-biased immune gene module in specific cell type. This step was

617

performed with the NetworkX package (https://networkx.github.io/) on Python 3.7

618

platform.

619
620

Statistical analysis and network visualization

621

Statistical tests for assessing categorical data through 𝜒2 was performed by SciPy 1.2.1

622

(https://www.scipy.org/). The one-way ANOVA was used to compare the difference of

623

continuous clinical variable by sex. All statistical analyses with the significance level set

624

at p < 0.05 were used. Networks were visualized using Cytoscape.
