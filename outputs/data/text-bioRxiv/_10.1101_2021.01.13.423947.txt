Abstract:
Background:

The current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for new and

fast methods to identify novel or repurposed therapeutic drugs. Here we present a method
for untargeted phenotypic drug screening of virus-infected cells, combining Cell Painting
with antibody-based detection of viral infection in a single assay. We designed an image
analysis pipeline for segmentation and classification of virus-infected and non-infected
cells, followed by extraction of morphological properties.

Results:

We show that the methodology can successfully capture virus-induced

phenotypic signatures of MRC-5 human lung fibroblasts infected with Human coronavirus
229E (CoV-229E). Moreover, we demonstrate that our method can be used in phenotypic
drug screening using a panel of nine host- and virus-targeting antivirals. Treatment with
effective antiviral compounds reversed the morphological profile of the host cells towards
a non-infected state.

Conclusions: The method can be used in drug discovery for morphological profiling of
novel antiviral compounds on both infected and non-infected cells.

Background
In the light of the current Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the development of new therapies
against emerging viruses is of high priority. Understanding how viruses affect the host cells is key
to identify potential targets for treatment. RNA viruses are characterized by their fast mutation
rate resulting in resilience against antiviral drugs, as well as heavy reliance on host pathways for
replication (1,2). In this context, coronaviruses are an exception to this norm given the existing
RNA proofreading machinery within their genome, but nevertheless develop treatment escape
mutants (3). Therefore, host targeting- as well as combination- therapies might be advantageous
to battle current and future virus outbreaks. Hence, new methods to profile cellular responses
during virus infection that can be used for drug screening are greatly needed.
Image-based morphological profiling of cells, or phenomics, combines high-content imaging with
multiparametric analysis of single-cells to study biological and chemical perturbations (4). The
Cell Painting assay is a high-content image-based method for morphological profiling that uses
six multiplexed fluorescent dyes imaged in five channels. These dyes reveal eight relevant cellular
components that can be used to simultaneously interrogate numerous biological pathways upon
a given perturbation (5). The resulting images can be analyzed using traditional image analysis
techniques to provide information-rich profiles of individual cells, as well as serve as input for
machine or deep learning approaches (6). This method has been successfully applied to study
compound toxicity, predict cell health indicators, detect morphological disease signatures, and
give insights into the mechanism of action (MoA) of both existing and novel compounds (7–12).
In contrast to target-based screens, where only a limited number of features are quantified to
select for a known cellular phenotype, morphological profiling combined with statistical analysis
can unravel subtle morphological patterns and provide insights into new pathways or mechanisms
(5). While morphological profiling is gaining ground in the field of pharmacology and toxicology,
its employment in the field of virology has been limited (13). However, with the increased
momentum in virology research caused by the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, morphological profiling
is progressively being implemented as a strategy for the selection and optimization of drugs, and
drug combinations, as potential antiviral therapies (14–16).

Immunofluorescence-based antiviral screening methods commonly rely on the use of specific
antibodies for the visualisation and quantification of virus-infected cells. These methods have
been proven successful for identifying drugs that directly affect cell survival and infectability of the
virus, but lack the depth to provide detailed information about the effect on the host cell (17,18).
Here we describe a novel phenomics approach, combining morphological profiling with antibodybased detection of virus infection in a single assay using Human coronavirus 229E (CoV-229E)
infected MRC-5 primary lung fibroblasts, in the absence or presence of several known and novel
antiviral compounds. We developed an automated image analysis pipeline for the identification of
infected and non-infected cells, generating hundreds of morphological measurements to study
host-cell biology at a single-cell level. We used the resulting morphological profiles to capture a
virus-induced phenotypic signature, we show how these profiles can be used to screen for
antivirals that reverse the cellular phenotype from an “infected”- towards a “non-infected” status,
and to potentially identify the MoA of novel antiviral compounds.

Results
Cell Painting features capture effects of viral infection
In order to investigate how viral infection affects the host cells, the original morphological profiling
protocol known as Cell Painting (5) was modified and combined with antibody-based staining.
Incorporation of an antibody against virus nucleoprotein (NP) allowed for the identification of virus
infection at a single-cell level. In parallel, hundreds of parameters were measured from the
infected cells using five of the Cell Painting dyes. Specifically, the dyes consisted of Hoechst
(DNA), SYTO 14 (nucleoli and cytoplasmic RNA), Phalloidin (F-actin), Concanavalin A (mannose
residues of glycoproteins, especially Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)), and Wheat Germ Agglutinin
(sialic acid and N-acetylglucosamine moieties of glycoproteins, especially plasma membrane and
Golgi) (Fig. 1A and Table 1). Upon CoV-229E infection, MRC-5 cells were stained using our
modified Cell Painting assay combined with a coronavirus NP-specific antibody.
A CellProfiler image analysis pipeline was designed to distinguish between infected and noninfected cells using the coronavirus NP-specific antibody signal in the perinuclear space as a
measure (Fig. 1B). Using this pipeline, a total of 1441 features corresponding to the five
fluorescent dyes were extracted at single cell level, subsequently the cells were labelled according
to their infection state based on the NP antibody. After pre-processing, the centred and
normalized features were visualized using a heatmap. Clustering of the features highlighted the

distinct morphological signature between non-infected and infected cells (Fig. 1C). Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce redundancy and correlation of the features and
to facilitate interpretation. PCA analysis revealed a clear separation between infected and noninfected cells on the first principal component, based on the Cell Painting dyes only (Fig. 1D). A
gradually increasing separation between non-infected and infected cells coincided with an equally
increasing NP antibody signal Fig. 1D).
To explore what features contributed most to the virus-induced phenotype, we applied Partial
Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) using the antibody signal as a label. The PLS-DA
model could predict viral infection with substantial accuracy (R2 = 0.73) (Fig. 1E). The PLS-DA
loadings were used to indicate important feature classes associated with the virus-induced
phenotype. The virus-induced morphology was characterized by changes in a wide variety of
features, distributed over various cell compartments and stains. The most prominent feature
groups related to viral infection, corresponded to the Concanavalin A and SYTO14 staining (An
overview of the importance of each of the feature classes, grouped by module, cell compartment,
and stain if applicable is provided in Fig. 1F and G, and Suppl. Table 1). Overall, our analysis
demonstrated the strength of phenomics profiling to identify morphological changes exclusive of
virus-infected cells.
A novel phenomics approach for the identification of antiviral compounds
To assess if Cell Painting combined with NP-antibody staining could be leveraged as a tool to
profile or screen for antiviral drugs, we designed a phenomics approach including viral infection,
compound treatment, cytochemistry protocol, image analysis pipeline, and finally data analysis
and visualization (Fig. 2, Suppl. Fig. 1). This new method is designed to capture in-depth
morphological profiles of the host cells induced by virus infection as well as treatment with
potential antiviral compounds.
For the first experimental section (Fig. 2A-1), cells are seeded in multiwell plates and allowed to
attach overnight, this is followed by virus infection for one hour. Subsequently, virus-containing
media is removed and compounds are added and incubated for 24 or 48h followed by fixation.
Next, cells are permeabilized and blocked before the primary antibody against virus NP is applied.
After incubation with the primary antibody, a cocktail of Cell Painting dyes and the secondary
antibody is added to the cells.

For the second section of the method (Fig. 2A-2), high-content imaging is used to capture multiple
fields of interest covering the wells. A CellProfiler image analysis pipeline is built to extract singlecell features from all the acquired images. The pipeline includes quality control of the images, preprocessing and feature extraction, and is universal, requiring only minor adjustments for accurate
segmentation and determination of thresholds when applied on different cell lines and viruses.
For the third and final section of the method (Fig. 2A-3), a data analysis and data visualisation
pipeline is built. Given that data analysis and representation can be subject to own-interpretation,
the work presented here doesn’t provide a specific data analysis pipeline but provides an example
of how the data can be analyzed and visualized.
An antibody-based method identifies Remdesivir and E-64d as potent antiviral
compounds.
To compare our phenomics approach to one of the traditional methods for antiviral drugs
screening, we first explored the antiviral efficacy of a set of 9 compounds using an NP-specific
antibody. The compounds included two direct-acting drugs targeting viral RNA polymerase
(Remdesivir and Favipiravir), and seven host-targeting antiviral compounds (E-64d, Camostat,
Cathepsin L inhibitor and Bafilomycin A1), including three novel in-house developed broadspectrum antiviral compounds TH3289, TH6744 and TH5487 (Suppl. Fig. 2A) (19, 20). MRC-5
cells were either not infected or infected with CoV-229E and were then exposed to the compounds
at three different concentrations (Suppl. Fig. 2A). We determined cell survival by nuclei count
and infection rate by the number of anti-coronavirus nucleoprotein positive cells, both in respect
to DMSO (Fig. 3A). Antiviral activity with no cellular toxicity was observed upon Remdesivir and
E-64d treatment. Treatment with clinically utilized Remdesivir reduced infection by 75% at 0.1µM
and 99% at 1µM and 8µM concentrations. At the same time, E-64d treatment resulted in a
reduction in viral infection of 31%, 82% or 92% compared to DMSO at 1, 10 or 30 µM
concentrations, respectively (Fig. 3A). Neither FDA-approved Favipiravir nor pre-clinical
compounds Camostat or Cathepsin L inhibitor reduced the number of infected cells, while
Bafilomycin A1 was toxic at all tested concentrations regardless of the presence of the virus
(Suppl. Fig 2B). Exposure to the broadly active host-targeting antiviral compounds TH3289,
TH6744 and TH5487 showed 62%, 56% and 56% reduction in the levels of infected cells, upon
10 µM treatments, respectively (Fig. 3A). The antiviral effect was also confirmed by a decrease
in the anti-NP antibody signal (Fig. 3B and C), which was evidently lost for the compounds that
displayed toxicity.

Identification of antiviral drugs that reverse infected morphological profiles
In order to demonstrate the use of our approach for drug screening, we assessed the antiviral
activity of the aforementioned compounds solely by morphological profiling of the host cell, in the
absence of the NP-antibody. We used unsupervised hierarchical clustering to map similarities
between the morphological profiles according to their proximity in feature space on all conditions
with a survival of 80% or higher. Hierarchical clustering using the Euclidean metric resulted in two
main clusters (Fig. 4A). The first cluster included both infected cells and infected cells treated
with non-effective antivirals (Favipiravir, Camostat and Cathepsin L inhibitor). The second cluster
contained both non-infected conditions (control- and compound- treated), as well as infected cells
treated with potent antiviral compounds, Remdesivir, E-64d, and the in-house developed TH3289,
TH6744 and TH5487, suggesting a rescue or reversion of the virus-induced phenotypic profile
(Fig. 4A).
PCA was used to study the effects of every single compound and dose in more detail. In
accordance with the hierarchical clustering, Remdesivir and E-64d treated cells grouped together
with non-infected control conditions at all tested doses (Fig. 4B and C). Compounds, TH3289,
TH6744 and TH5487 showed a dose-dependent response, where treatment with the middle (10
µM) doses showed a trend towards the non-infected cluster, low doses (1 µM) clustered with the
infected cells, and high doses (30 µM) formed separate clusters (Fig. 4D, E and F). Treatment
with the compounds Camostat, Favipiravir and Cathepsin L inhibitor, which did not reduce the
number of infected cells, clustered all with the infected cells in PCA space (Fig. 4G and Suppl.
Fig. 4A, B).
The morphological features also provided information on the effect of the compound on the host
cells, as illustrated by the morphological profiles in absence of virus (Suppl. Fig. 3). The
morphological profiles of TH3289, TH6744 and TH5487, which are structural analogues, clustered
closely together as indicated by the dendrogram (Fig. 4A). Similarly, the TMPRSS family protease
inhibitor Camostat clustered together with the protease inhibitor E-64d in the absence of the virus
(Fig. 4A). Bafilomycin A1 treatment, which was toxic to the cells, as well as cytotoxic doses of the
TH compounds, formed clusters separate from both infected and noninfected controls (Suppl.
Fig. 4C). In summary, these results demonstrate the suitability of our phenomics approach to
identify antiviral drugs by reverting virus-induced phenotypic signatures and by providing
information on compounds' effect on the host cells.

Discussion
Traditional targeted screens for antiviral drugs often focus on known proteins in the replication
cycle of the virus, neglecting the effects of both the virus and the compound on the host cell. On
the contrary, morphological cell profiling enables an untargeted approach for the characterization
of cellular responses of infected cells with a high spatiotemporal resolution, high throughput, and
on a single-cell level. Here, we present a method utilizing Cell Painting combined with a virusspecific antibody to profile host cell responses upon virus infection and demonstrate its potential
to serve as a platform for finding effective antiviral compounds.
By adapting the Cell Painting protocol, we were able to detect a distinct virus-induced phenotype
for MRC-5 cells infected with CoV-229E (Fig. 2C). The induced phenotype was characterized by
changes distributed over various cell compartments and stains, of which the most prominent were
observed for Concanavalin A and the SYTO14. The replication cycle of RNA viruses, including
Coronaviruses is closely associated with ER and Golgi networks, ensuring close proximity of
replication factors, viral protein processing and ultimately viable virus progeny (21). Given that
Concanavalin A specifically binds to mannose-rich residues of glycoproteins, which are
predominantly present in the ER, the increased intensity of ER signal detected in CoV-229E
infected cells can be explained by innate sensing of viral proteins by host ER stress pathways or
increased viral glycoprotein content (22). It should be noted that Cell Painting dyes such as
Concanavalin A (23) and SYTO-14 are likely to bind to certain viral-induced or viral-derived
targets in the host cell, which could in turn contribute to the generated morphological profiles.
Antibody-based screening methods for antivirals have been successfully used in the past to
identify potential candidate treatments (24). We used this method to benchmark our phenomics
approach. According to their antiviral activity, Remdesivir and E64d, which have been previously
shown to ameliorate coronavirus infections (25,26), significantly reduced the percentage of
infected cells. Similarly, but with less efficacy, the broad-spectrum antiviral compounds TH3289,
TH6744 and TH5487, reduced the number of infected cells, albeit with accompanying toxicity. On
the other hand, under our tested conditions, we could not reproduce the previously reported
antiviral activities from Favipiravir, Camostat, Cathepsin L inhibitor or Bafilomycin A1 (25–29).
These results may be explained by cell-dependent effects, the timing, or the selected doses of
treatment, which could be addressed by optimisation of the experimental conditions in future
studies.

Despite the fact that antibody-based screening could identify antiviral compounds, it did not
provide further information about the host cells beyond viability. Utilizing our phenomics method,
we identified antiviral compounds that could reverse the virus-induced morphological profile
towards a healthy state. In particular, treatment with Remdesivir, E-64d, TH3289, TH6744 and
TH5487 induced morphological profiles that were more similar to non-infected than to infected
conditions. Interestingly, as indicated by unsupervised hierarchical clustering, the morphological
profiles of TH3289, TH6744 and TH5487, clustered together with drugs that possess much more
antiviral efficacy (Fig. 4A). Accordingly, this time visualised using PCA, the antiviral activity of
Remdesivir and E-64d and the three in-house-developed antivirals was reflected by their
clustering close to the control non-infected condition, which indicates a potential rescue of the
virus-induced phenotype. Altogether, this points to the fact that based solely on the results of the
antibody-based method, the in-house developed compounds would have likely been discarded
as antivirals given their toxicity. However, according to the results of our phenomics approach
these compounds might have a more potent antiviral efficacy than anticipated, which opens up
the possibility for their further development.
A substantial advantage of using morphological profiling to screen for antiviral drugs is the indepth analysis of the host cell status upon infection as well as upon compound treatment. Thus,
despite not being able to recapitulate the antiviral activities of all the tested compounds, we have
obtained valuable information that can be used to further understand their biological effect. For
instance, in line with several previous studies showing that compounds with similar MoA result in
similar phenotypic profiles (4,30,31), for novel compounds such as the ones we tested, the
comparison of their morphological profiles against the ones of a reference set could aid at the
identification of their MoA. In fact, the unsupervised clustering of the morphological profiles (Fig.
4A) seems to indicate that, in the presence of the virus, TH3289, TH5487, and to a lesser extent
TH6744, induce a similar signature to E-64d, which despite the need for validation, could suggest
that these novel antiviral compounds also have protease inhibitory activity. Despite the very
limited number of compounds used in our study, this highlights the use of our method not only to
identify opportunities for drugs repurposing but also for the actual discovery of novel antiviral
compounds.
A challenge of morphological profiling is the large amount of data generated, which is accentuated
when using single-cell measurements. The analysis strategy of such rich data is open to its own

interpretation, and might require specific computational and analytical skills. In the case of the
work presented here, the statistical and analysis tools used were tailored to our application.
However, a comprehensive and detailed guide and toolset on how to analyse morphological
profiling data have been previously published (6,11).
Given the increasing implementation of morphological profiling, the biological interpretation of the
morphological changes induced by a given perturbation is a subject of active research (4,11).
Consequently, the results of this study will benefit from a better understanding of the link between
phenomics signatures and the underlying biological mechanism. Interestingly, our results suggest
that Cell Painting alone could potentially be used as a phenotypic screening readout to distinguish
infected from non-infected cells, and thus be utilized for antiviral screens without the need for an
additional virus-specific antibody.

Conclusions
Our novel phenomics method provides an untargeted readout for the screening of antiviral drugs,
in a single assay, at the single-cell level. The morphological signatures obtained using our method
can be utilized to identify the potential MoA of novel compounds by comparing them to those of
annotated reference drugs, highlighting the use of this method in drug discovery. Morphological
profiling provides high adaptability and scalability to study different cell lines and perturbations.
Accordingly, we anticipate that our untargeted approach, with only minor adjustments of the image
analysis pipeline, will enable other applications using diverse (human-derived) cell lines, as well
as different viruses. Overall, we demonstrated that our phenomics approach can be utilized for
the unbiased study of virus-induced effects on host cells that can be leveraged for drug
repurposing, as well as for the discovery of novel antiviral compounds.

Methods
Biosafety
All experiments in presence of infectious virus were performed under respective biosafety
laboratory (BSL) conditions according to Swedish Work and Health Authorities. Experiments
using CoV-229E were performed at BSL2 at Karolinska Institutet.
Cell culture
MRC-5 cells (from ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in Minimum Essential Media
supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA), 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA). The cells were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and the cell culture was routinely tested
for Mycoplasma using a luminescence-based MycoAlert kit (Lonza).
Virus production
CoV-229E (VR-740; from ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) stocks were amplified in Huh7 cells. Virus
titers were determined in Huh7 cells by end-point dilution assay combined with high-throughput
immunofluorescence imaging of viral protein staining as previously described (19).
Compounds
Remdesivir and Favipiravir were purchased from Carbosynth. TH6744, TH3289 and TH5487
were in-house produced and recently described (19,20). Compounds Camostat (SML0057), E64d (E8640), Cathepsin L inhibitor (SCP0110), Bafilomycin A (B1793) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Cell painting positive and negative controls included Etoposide (E1383),
Fenbendazole (F5396), Metoclopramide (M0763), Sorbitol (S1876) and DMSO (D2438) (Sigma
Aldrich).
Virus infection and compound treatments
Antiviral compounds and cell painting positive controls were dissolved in DMSO to 10mM
solutions, and dispersed in 96-well source plates at 500✕ of the final concentration using the
D300e Digital Dispenser (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) and stored at －20 °C until use.
Compound and virus infection conditions were randomized within the plates and multiple plate
layouts were used to compensate for systematic effects related to the well position. To further
avoid plate and edge-effects, the outer wells were excluded from experimentation. Three doses
were chosen for each antiviral compound (final concentration; DMSO 0.3% v/v). A total of 2500
MRC-5 cells per well were seeded in black 96 multiwell plates 24 hours before infection (Costar

kept at room temperature for 20 minutes to aid homogeneous spreading in the wells and
incubated overnight at 37 ℃ at 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were infected with a MOI 10 or 15 in
50 μL culture medium for one hour and at least four wells per plate were left uninfected as a mock
control. Virus-containing medium was removed, replaced with 80 μL culture medium and 20 µL
compound-containing medium in at least two technical duplicates, reaching 1✕ of the final
compound concentration. Cells were incubated for 24 or 48 hours. Cells were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in PBS (Gibco, USA) for 20
minutes, washed twice with PBS and stored at 4℃ prior to further processing.
Cell Painting and antibody detection
To profile morphological features of virus-infected cells an adapted version of the cell painting
assay was used (5). Specific fluorescent probes or fluorophore-conjugated small molecules were
used for the detection of various cellular components (Table 1). To accommodate virus-specific
antibody detection in parallel to Cell Painting, the dye specific to mitochondria (MitoTracker) from
the original cell Painting protocol was replaced with a coronavirus-nucleoprotein specific antibody.
Compared to the original cell painting assay consisting of six dyes targeting eight components/
cell organelles, here five dyes and a virus-specific antibody were used to target virus
nucleoprotein in parallel to seven cell organelles and cell components in a single multiplexed
staining assay (Table 1). Representative images of each of the stains can be found in Fig 1A.
Coronavirus pan monoclonal antibody (FIPV3-70, Invitrogen) was combined with a secondary
antibody using Alexa Fluor 647 fluorophore (10739374, Invitrogen), chosen for its narrow
emission and excitation spectra to limit interference with the other channels. To avoid fading of
the chemical stains, in our experience, the secondary antibody is best added together with the
chemical dyes, but can also be applied sequentially. Concentrations of secondary antibodies need
to be adjusted for a good signal-to-noise ratio in the multiplexed assay. In Table 1, working
concentrations and specifications for the stains and antibodies are presented.
Fixed cells were washed twice (BioTek, 405 LS washer) and permeabilized by incubation with 80
μl of 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 minutes at room temperature, followed by two washes with 1X PBS.
Then, 80 μl of 0.2% BSA (A8022) in PBS was added and incubated for 30 minutes. Next, the
plates were washed twice with 1X PBS and 50μl primary antibody was added. The primary
antibody was incubated for four hours at room temperature after which the plates were washed

three times for five minutes. A staining solution of Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen, cat.no H3570),
SYTO 14 green (Invitrogen, cat.no S7576), Concanavalin A/Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen, cat.no
C11252), Wheat Germ Agglutinin/Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, cat.no W32464) and
Phalloidin/Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen, cat.no A12380) was prepared in PBS in addition to Goat
anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen Catalog
# A-21235). 50 μl of staining mixture was added to each well and incubated for 30 minutes, after
which the plates were washed a final three times for five minutes. Plates were either imaged
immediately or sealed and kept at 4 °C to be imaged later. All washing steps were performed
using a Biotek 405 LS washer, dispensing was done using the Biotek Multiflo FX, multimode
dispenser. Plates were protected from light as much as possible.
Imaging
Fluorescent images were acquired using an Image Xpress Micro XLS (Molecular Devices)
microscope with a 20X objective using laser-based autofocus. In total, 9 sites per well were
captured using 5 fluorescence channels (DAPI, Cy5, TexasRed, Cy3 and FITC). To avoid
photobleaching, the channels were imaged in order of decreasing excitation wavelength (except
DAPI) (Table 1). Examples of images from the different channels are shown in Figure 1A.
Image Analysis pipeline
Image Quality control and preprocessing
Images were processed and analysed with the open-source image analysis software CellProfiler
(available at https://cellprofiler.org/), version 4.0.6 (32). Prior to analysis, a quality control (QC)
pipeline was run on the raw images to detect images with artefacts, which may corrupt the data
with false values (6). We computed various measures to represent a variety of artefacts and used
statistical analysis to detect outliers. Images deviating more than 5 standard deviations from the
median of FocusScore, MaxIntensity, MeanIntensity, PercentMaximal, PowerLogLogSlope and
StdIntensity were flagged, inspected and removed if necessary. To remove blurred images, the
PercentMaximal score and PowerLogLogSlope was computer and images with percentMaximal
values higher than 0.25, or PowerLogLogSlope values lower than -2.3 were removed from the
dataset. The QC detected 95 images as outliers, as indicated by one or multiple of the control
measures. To assess the reproducibility of the assay and detect possible plate and drift effects
across multiple plates the various quality measures were visualized and inspected (Supp. Fig.
5).

In addition, we used cell-level quality control based on the Hoechst staining to detect bright
artefacts and clumped cells. Bright artefacts in the DAPI channel were identified using the Identify
Primary Object module in CellProfiler, artefacts and surrounding pixels were masked to avoid
interference with segmentation.
To correct for uneven illumination in the images, the polynomial illumination correction function
was calculated for each plate and each image channel across all cycles resulting in one
illumination correction image per channel. The illumination functions were then used in the
analysis pipelines to correct each image by dividing by the respective illumination correction
image.
Segmentation
Segmentation based on the DAPI channel was performed by applying a gaussian blur followed
by Otsu thresholding to segment the outlines of each nucleus. The cell objects were segmented
using Watershed segmentation using minimum Cross-entropy of the cytoplasmic RNA stain,
using the nuclei as a seed. The cytoplasm cell compartment was defined as the cell object
subtracted from the nuclei. Segmentation of the perinuclear cell compartment was accomplished
by the expansion of 20 pixels in the concanavalin A channel and subtraction of the nuclei. Minor
adjustments of the parameters are needed to be used between different experimental setups and
on different cell lines.
Feature extraction
After identification of the four cell compartments, phenotypic characteristics were measured using
the AreaShape, Correlation, Intensity, Granularity, Location, Neighbors, and RadialDistribution
modules as provided by CellProfiler (32). A total of 1441 features were extracted from each object
which were exported into csv format for downstream analysis.
Classification
To classify the cells for infection state, we used a virus NP-specific antibody. The classification
module by CellProfiler Analyst was used to find highly indicative features associated with infection
by manual annotation of infected and noninfected cells. Accordingly, the mean intensity of the
antibody signal in the perinuclear cell compartment was selected for classification of MRC-5 cells
infected with CoV-229E. The threshold for infection was defined as the mean plus three standard
deviations from the virus NP-specific antibody intensity in the blank control. The set-off was

determined on a plate-to-plate basis to avoid bias by batch-effects and was checked for accuracy
by checking for false positives in non-infected wells.
Antiviral dose-response and cytotoxicity
Nuclei count was used to determine the toxicity induced by compounds alone, as well as
compound and virus combined. Averaged nuclei count per condition were normalised to the
DMSO controls. To capture relevant cellular phenotypes, cytotoxic compounds resulting in less
than 80% survival, were removed from the analysis. Antiviral efficacy was calculated as the
percentage of virus-positive cells per well and was normalized to DMSO+virus control which was
set to 100%.
Statistics
All experiments were performed in two separate biological replicates, each consisting of duplicate
conditions. Where indicated, plots represent mean +/- SD of the biological replicates. Statistical
analysis was done using GraphPad Prism version 9.0 (GraphPad Software Inc). One- or Twoway-ANOVA was performed for all the datasets that required comparison among multiple data
points within a given experimental condition. Dunnet was applied for the correction of multiple
comparisons, and the family-wise alpha threshold and confidence level were 0.05
(95%confidence interval).
Feature analysis
In order to facilitate the broad use of our phenomics approach, an image analysis pipeline is
provided with the paper, which is tailored to the application here presented, and once executed
will provide the necessary input for subsequent analysis. Downstream analysis of the feature data
was performed using Python 3. Prior analysis, the data was cleaned from images with artefacts
as identified by the QC pipeline described above. Next, the feature values were centred and
normalized. Normalization was done across all plates. Invariant features, features with extreme
variation (>15 standard deviations) and features with missing data were removed. The features
relating to the virus antibody were removed prior analysis of virus-induced morphological profiles.
To compare morphological profiles, the features were presented as cluster maps. Features were
scaled using the sklearn StandardScaler method, by subtracting the mean and scaling to unit
variance. This ensured that each feature (clustermap column) has a mean of 0 and variance of 1.
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering on the morphological profiles was computed using the

Euclidean metric, and the clustering algorithm using Ward's method and visualized using the
seaborn data visualization library (version 0.11.0).
Visualization of the high dimensional data was done using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
on the centered and normalized features. The image-level feature data was averaged to simplify
visualization. Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was used to model the virus
infection and select features associated with viral infection. Q2 and R2 values were calculated for
the PLS-DA model, which were estimated by five-fold cross-validation. The absolute mean of
PLS-DA loadings were calculated and were grouped by Cell Profiler module (AreaShape,
Correlation, Intensity, Granularity, Location, Neighbors, RadialDistribution), cell compartment
(nuclei, perinuclear space, cytoplasm, cell) and by stain (Hoechst, Concanavalin A, SYTO14,
WGA and phalloidin).
