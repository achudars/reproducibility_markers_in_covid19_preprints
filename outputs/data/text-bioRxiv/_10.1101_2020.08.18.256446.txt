Abstract

16

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectious disease

17

(COVID-19) has been threatening the world because of severe symptoms and relatively high

18

mortality. To develop vaccines and antiviral drugs for COVID-19, an animal model of SARS-CoV-2

19

infection is required to evaluate the efficacy of prophylactics and therapeutics in vivo. Therefore, we

20

examined the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in cynomolgus macaques until 28 days after virus

21

inoculation in the present study. Cynomolgus macaques showed body temperature rises after

22

infection and X-ray radiographic viral pneumonia was observed in one of three macaques. However,

23

none of the macaques showed life-threatening clinical signs of disease corresponding that

24

approximately 80% of human patients did not show a critical disease in COVID-19. A neutralizing

25

antibody against SARS-CoV-2 and T-lymphocytes that produced interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin

26

(IL)-2 specifically for SARS-CoV-2 N protein were detected on day 14 in the macaque that showed

27

viral pneumonia. On the other hand, in the other macaques, in which a neutralizing antibody was

28

not detected, T-lymphocytes that produced IFN-γ specifically for SARS-CoV-2 N protein increased

29

on day 7 to day 14 prior to an increase in the number of T-lymphocytes that produced IL-2. These

30

results suggest that not only a neutralizing antibody but also cellular immunity augmented by IFN-γ

31

has a role in the elimination of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, because of the mild clinical signs of disease and

32

low/no antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 in two thirds of the macaques, cynomolgus

33

macaques are appropriate to extrapolate human responses in vaccine and drug development.

Author Summary

36

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectious disease (COVID-19)

37

has been threatening the world. To develop vaccines and antiviral drugs for COVID-19, an animal

38

model of SARS-CoV-2 infection is required to evaluate their efficacy in vivo. Therefore, we

39

examined the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in a non-human primate model until 28 days after

40

virus inoculation. Cynomolgus macaques showed a fever after infection and X-ray radiographic

41

viral pneumonia was observed in one of three macaques. However, none of the macaques showed

42

life-threatening symptoms. A neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 and T-lymphocytes that

43

produced interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-2 specifically for SARS-CoV-2 protein were

44

detected on day 14 in the macaque that showed viral pneumonia. In the other macaques, in which a

45

neutralizing antibody was not detected, T-lymphocytes that produced IFN-γ specifically for

46

SARS-CoV-2 N protein increased on day 7 to day 14. These results suggest that not only a

47

neutralizing antibody but also cellular immunity augmented by IFN-γ has a role in the elimination

48

of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, because of the mild symptoms and low/no antibody responses against

49

SARS-CoV-2 in two thirds of the macaques, cynomolgus macaques are appropriate to extrapolate

50

human responses in vaccine and drug development.

Introduction

53

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (COVID-19)

54

has been spreading around the world since late 2019 [1], and WHO declared a pandemic on March

55

11, 2020. Accumulating reports indicate varying degrees of illness including asymptomatic patients,

56

patients with mild respiratory symptoms, and patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome

57

(ARDS) requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) [2-4]. In addition to the development

58

of vaccines and antiviral drugs specific for SARS-CoV-2, determination of the pathogenicity in

59

patients with severe clinical signs of disease and development of therapeutics for severe cases are

60

urgent issues.

61

For the development of prophylactics and therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infection, not

62

only in vitro studies but also in vivo studies are required for evaluation of their efficacy, especially

63

estimation of in vivo efficacy, for which assessments are difficult in clinical trials. Therefore, animal

64

models that show pathogenicity similar to that in humans are necessary for research and

65

development of vaccines and antiviral drugs [5]. The results of several studies on the experimental

66

infection of SARS-CoV-2 in animals have been reported. In a mouse model, SARS-CoV-2

67

propagated in the lungs of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) transgenic mice but not

68

the lungs of wild-type mice, and the virus caused interstitial pneumonia in the ACE2 transgenic

69

mice [6]. However, co-expression of human ACE2 and endogenous mouse ACE2 may change the

70

disease progression to recapitulate COVID-19. Wild-type Syrian hamsters are sensitive to

71

SARS-CoV-2, which propagated in the lungs to cause viral pneumonia, indicating a useful small

72

animal model [7, 8]. However, since the viral pneumonia was resolved within 2 weeks in Syrian

73

hamsters and antibodies that react to hamster molecules are not available in order to examine

74

immune responses, another model is required to examine the pathogenicity of severe COVID-19.

75

SARS-CoV-2 also propagated and caused lung inflammation and pneumonia in rhesus and

76

cynomolgus macaques [9-13]. The pathogenicity in the macaques was examined until 21 days after

77

virus infection in most of the studies except one study [13], in which the reason that the prolonged

78

detection of viral genes in patients and virus-antigen specific T-lymphocyte responses were not

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.18.256446; this version posted August 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

79

revealed [14]. Therefore, in the present study, we observed cynomolgus macaques infected with

80

SARS-CoV-2 for 4 weeks and examined T-lymphocyte responses specific for SARS-CoV-2 antigen

81

peptides.

82

The macaque model, of which immune responses and metabolism resemble those of

83

humans, is useful to extrapolate the efficacy of vaccines and antiviral drugs in humans against

84

SARS-CoV-2. In our previous studies on influenza virus infection, various influenza viruses

85

including pandemic and avian influenza viruses propagated in cynomolgus macaques that showed

86

clinical signs of disease similar to human symptoms [15, 16]. In addition, we detected influenza

87

viruses that were less sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors in treated macaques, indicating a useful

88

model for predicting the emergence of a drug-resistant virus [17, 18]. Therefore, we have used the

89

cynomolgus macaque model to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines and antiviral drugs in influenza

90

virus infection [19-23]. In the present study, we have expanded our experimental system to establish

91

a SARS-CoV-2 infection model in cynomolgus macaques for preclinical studies.

92

We revealed the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in the cynomolgus macaques.

93

SARS-CoV-2 propagated in respiratory tissues and caused body temperature rises in all of the

94

macaques. However, viral pneumonia in X-ray radiographs was confirmed in one third of the

95

macaques, in which a neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in plasma was detected. We also

96

found a thrombus in the lung of a macaque infected with SARS-CoV-2 as reported in human cases

97

[24]. These results are similar to observations in human patients with COVID-19 [1]. Compared to

98

influenza virus infection, the rate of detection of a neutralizing antibody was low in macaques

99

infected with SARS-CoV-2 [19, 25]. In addition, interferon (IFN)-γ responses with delayed

100

interleukin (IL)-2 responses might be related to virus elimination without a neutralizing antibody.

101

Thus, cynomolgus macaques are an appropriate animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection for the

102

development of vaccines and antiviral drugs.

Results

105

SARS-CoV-2 propagation predominantly in the nasal and oral cavities of cynomolgus

106

macaques

107

We inoculated the SARS-CoV-2 JPN/TY/WK-521/2020 (WK-521) strain [26] into the

108

conjunctiva, nasal cavity, oral cavity, and trachea of cynomolgus macaques to examine the

109

pathogenicity of the strain. We collected swab samples to examined virus propagation in the

110

macaques. The virus was detected in swab samples of the conjunctiva, nasal cavity, oral cavity, and

111

trachea of three macaques on day 1 (the next day after virus inoculation) (Table 1). The virus was

112

detected in nasal and oral swab samples of two macaques, CE0202M and CE0324F, until day 7. No

113

virus was detected in swab samples after day 10 or in homogenized tissue samples collected on day

114

28 at autopsy (listed in Table S1).

116
117

Clinical signs of disease in macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2
Cynomolgus macaques showed clinical signs of disease after infection with SARS-CoV-2

118

WK-521. All of the macaques showed rises in body temperature after virus inoculation (day 1 to

119

day 2) (Fig. 1). Body temperatures of two macaques (CE0324F and CE1242F) on day 1 were higher

120

than 39.5oC, whereas CE0202M showed a rise in body temperature only at night from day 1 to day

121

2. Body weight of CE0324F decreased by 10% until day 28 due to loss of appetite (Fig. S1A). No

122

macaques showed clinical scores that reached a humane endpoint (Table S2). Therefore, infection

123

with WK-521 induced mild clinical signs of disease that were varied in the macaques.

124
125
126

Viral pneumonia in macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2
Viral pneumonia and/or bronchopneumonia was observed in cynomolgus macaques infected with

127

SARS-CoV-2. Chest X-ray radiographs revealed a ground glass appearance in the lung, especially

128

in the peripheral pulmonary areas, of CE0324F from day 3 to day 7 but not after day 10 (Fig. 2A-C).

129

Saturation of percutaneous oxygen (SpO2) values in infected macaques at each sampling were

130

higher than 90% during the study (Fig. S1B). At autopsy on day 28, gross lesions were observed on

131

the surfaces of lungs including dark red and brown lesions in CE0324F, bright redness in CE0202M,

132

and small red areas in CE1242F (Fig. 2D-F).

133

Histological pneumonia was observed in all of the macaques infected with WK-521. Thickened

134

alveolar walls with infiltration of macrophages were observed in the lung with the macroscopic

135

lesions in CE0324F, indicating a regenerative tissue (Fig. 3A). A larger number of

136

bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues (BALT) were formed in the lung tissues of CE0324F (Fig.

137

3B) and CE1242F (Fig. S2A) than in those of CE0202M (Fig S2B). In CE0202M, congestion and a

138

thrombus in the lung blood vessels were detected (Fig. 3D, E) and bronchopneumonia was detected

139

in CE1242F (Fig. 3F). Lymphoid infiltration was detected in tissues other than respiratory organs.

140

Focal lymphoid accumulation was seen in the submandibular gland of CE0324F (Fig. 3C). Thus,

141

although no virus was detected on day 28, lymphoid responses continued until day 28 after virus

142

inoculation.

144

Biochemical analysis of blood in macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2

145

Organ functions after infection with SARS-CoV-2 were biochemically analyzed. Levels

146

of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in the plasma of CE0324F and

147

CE1242F were increased after virus infection, but their levels including total bilirubin were within

148

normal ranges, indicating minimal damage of the liver (Fig. 4A-C). No increase in the level of

149

blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or creatinine was detected, indicating normal kidney function after virus

150

infection (Fig. 4D, E). In CE0324F, the level of plasma amylase was temporally increased on day 1

151

(Fig. 4F).

152
153
154

Blood cell population in macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2
The blood cell population in macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 was examined. The

155

numbers of total white blood cells and granulocytes in CE0202M and CD1242F were increased

156

temporally on day 1, but the number of total white blood cells in CE0324F was decreased on days 1

157

and 3 and it was increased after day 14 (Fig. 5A, B). The numbers of lymphocytes in the blood of

158

CE0324F and CE1242F were decreased on day 1 and returned to the levels before infection on day

159

7 to day 10 (Fig. 5C), whereas the numbers of monocytes in CE0324F and CE1242F were increased

160

on day 7 and day 3, respectively (Fig. 5D). The numbers of platelets in CE0324F and CE1242F

161

were decreased on day 3. Thus, two of three macaques (CE0324F and CE1242F) showed apparent

162

changes in the population of blood cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

163
164

Immune responses in macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.18.256446; this version posted August 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

165

Immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in the cynomolgus macaques were examined. CE0324F

166

showed marked changes in plasma cytokine levels after infection (Fig. 6). The levels of the

167

inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) together with levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-1

168

(MCP-1) and IL-10 on day 1 were higher than those before infection. Levels of the Th2 cytokines

169

IL-4 and IL-13, Th17 cytokine IL-17, and chemokines MIP-1α were increased 10 days after virus

170

infection and the level of IL-8 was increased 21 days after virus infection, although the changes in

171

IL-17 and MIP-1α were small. Levels of the Th1 cytokines interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and IL-12 were

172

increased on day 1 after infection. IL-2 and TNF-α was detected in the plasma of CE0324F before

173

infection (day 0). CE1242F showed low cytokine responses in IL-6, MCP-1, IL-10, IL-4, IL-13,

174

MIP-1α, IFN-γ, and IL-12 compared with those in CE0324F. In CE0202M, levels of IL-8 and IL-12

175

on day 3 and levels of IL-13 from day 10 to day 17 were transiently increased, but no apparent

176

changes in other cytokines were detected during the study.

177

The neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 was detected in one macaque. A low titer of the

178

neutralizing antibody against WK-521 was detected in CE0324F on day 10 after virus inoculation,

179

but no neutralizing antibody was detected in the two other macaques until day 28 (Table 2). An IgG

180

response against SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins was detected in the plasma of CE0324F and

181

CE1242F after day 14 and day 21, respectively, using an available antibody detection kit for human

182

IgG/IgM (Fig. S3). No antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 was detected in CE0202M, in

183

which the number of BALTs was smaller than those in CE0324F and CE1242F, indicating a

184

relationship between IgG responses and BALT formation.

185
186

T lymphocyte responses specific for SARS-CoV-2 N protein were examined. In CE0324F, in
which the neutralizing antibody was detected, increases in the number of IL-2 and IFN-γ-producing

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.18.256446; this version posted August 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

187

cells specific for SARS-CoV-2 N protein were seen on day 14 after virus inoculation (Fig. 7). In

188

CE0202M, increases in the number of IFN-γ-producing cells and IL-2-producing cells were

189

detected on day 14 and day 21, respectively. In CE1242F, increases in the number of

190

IFN-γ -producing cells and IL-2-producing cells were detected on day 7 and day 14, respectively. In

191

the two latter monkeys, the increase in the number of IL-2-producing cells followed that of

192

IFN-γ -producing cells and the stimulation indices of IFN-γ-producing cells were higher than those

193

of IL-2-producing cells.

194
195
196

Discussion
We revealed the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in cynomolgus macaques to establish an

197

animal model for the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs. SARS-CoV-2 was detected

198

predominantly in the nasal cavity and oral cavity of cynomolgus macaques for one week, and

199

infection with SARS-CoV-2 caused a body temperature rise in all of the cynomolgus macaques

200

examined. However, radiographic viral pneumonia was observed in one third of macaques, in which

201

the neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 was detected. Histologically, pneumonia in the

202

repairing phase and/or bronchopneumonia were observed in all of the macaques and a thrombus in a

203

pulmonary blood vessel was detected [24]. Mild clinical signs of disease and virus propagation in

204

the respiratory tissue of cynomolgus macaques in the present study are consistent with the results of

205

previous studies using cynomolgus macaques and rhesus macaques [11, 12] and with the results of a

206

clinical study showing that approximately 80% of human patients with COVID-19 did not show

207

critical disease [27].

208

No neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2 was detected 28 days after virus

209

inoculation in two macaques in which body temperature increased and the virus propagated. On the

210

other hand, antibody responses specific for SARS-CoV-2 antigens were detected in most of the

211

macaques on day 14 after infection in previous studies [11, 12]. Our results are consistent with

212

results of studies showing delayed IgM and IgG responses in human patients with COVID-19

213

[28-30]. The results of the present study indicate that delayed antibody responses would occur in

214

patients without severe symptoms and complications. The results also suggested that the lack of an

215

antibody against SARS-CoV-2 does not necessarily mean evidence of uninfected individuals.

216

We also examined T-lymphocyte responses specific for SARS-CoV-2 N protein peptides.

217

In macaque CE0324F, in which the neutralizing antibody was detected, the number of cells

218

producing IFN-γ and IL-2 specific for SARS-CoV-2 N protein was increased 2 weeks after virus

219

inoculation. On the other hand, in CE0202M and CE1242F, in which no neutralizing antibody was

220

detected, an increase in the number of cells producing IL-2 specific for SARS-CoV-2 N protein

221

followed an increase in the number of cells producing IFN-γ. The results indicate that an IFN-γ

222

response with a low IL-2 response is not sufficient for induction of a neutralizing antibody. In

223

addition, the IFN-γ response (Th1 response) that helps so-called ‘cellular immunity’ might

224

contribute to elimination of SARS-CoV-2 without a neutralizing antibody. Another possibility is

225

that the early IFN-γ response in CE1242F was induced by memory Th1 cells, suggesting previous

226

exposure to the other coronaviruses. The effects of immunity against the common cold coronavirus

227

on SARS-CoV-2 infection will be analyzed using the macaque model in the future [31].

228

The level of amylase in the plasma of CE0324F was temporally increased. It has been

229

reported that blood amylase was released from the injured pancreas in patients with COVID-19

230

pneumonia [32, 33]. However, we did not detect inflammation or necrosis in the pancreas of

231

macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 at autopsy in the present study (data not shown). On the other

232

hand, lymphoid infiltration in the submandibular gland of CE0324F might be related to the increase

233

of plasma amylase [34], indicating that plasma amylase was derived from infected salivary glands

234

and that the virus detection in oral swab samples was due to virus propagation in the salivary glands

235

[35].

236

In the present study, we revealed that SARS-CoV-2 propagated in the respiratory tissues

237

of cynomolgus macaques and that SARS-CoV-2 caused clinical signs of disease, indicating that the

238

cynomolgus macaque model is useful for the evaluation of vaccination and therapies. In addition,

239

delayed and low antibody responses in the macaque model suggest that vaccination against

240

SARS-CoV-2 requires high immunogenicity of vaccines and multiple immunizations in humans.

enrichment under controlled conditions of humidity (39% - 61%), temperature (24 – 26°C), and

266

light (12-h light/12-h dark cycle, lights on at 8:00 a.m.). Two weeks before virus inoculation, a

267

telemetry probe (M00, Data Sciences International, St. Paul, MN) was implanted in the peritoneal

268

cavity or subcutaneous tissue of each macaque under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia followed by

269

isoflurane inhalation to monitor body temperature. The macaques used in the present study were

270

free from herpes B virus, hepatitis E virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Shigella spp., Salmonella

271

spp., and Entamoeba histolytica.

272

Under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia, two cotton sticks (Eiken Chemical, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan)

273

were used to collect fluid samples from the conjunctivas, nasal cavities, oral cavities and tracheas,

274

and the sticks were subsequently immersed in 1 mL of minimal essential medium (MEM, Nacalai

275

Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and antibiotics. A

276

bronchoscope (MEV-2560; Machida Endoscope Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and cytology brushes

277

(BC-203D-2006; Olympus Co., Tokyo, Japan) were used to obtain bronchial samples. Samples

278

were collected on indicated days.

279

Chest X-ray radiographs were taken using the I-PACS system (Konica Minolta Inc., Tokyo,

280

Japan) and PX-20BT mini (Kenko Tokina Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). SpO2 was measured with a

281

pulse oximeter (NellcorTM, Medtronic plc, Dublin, Ireland).

282
283

Virus and cells

284

SARS-CoV-2 JP/TY/WK-521/2020 was used as a challenge strain (GenBank Sequence

285

Accession: LC522975, kindly provided by Drs. Masayuki Saijo and Masaaki Sato, National

286

Institute of Infectious Disease (NIID) ) [26]. The virus was propagated twice in NIID and once at

287

the Shiga University of Medical Science using VeroE6 (American Type Culture Collection,

288

Manassas, VA) in the presence of BIOMYC-3 (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel).

289

The macaques were challenged with the WK-521 virus (2.2 × 106 TCID50) inoculated into the

290

conjunctiva (0.05 mL × 2), nostrils (0.5 mL × 2), oral cavity (0.9 mL), and trachea (5 mL) with

291

pipettes and catheters under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Experiments using the virus were

292

performed in the biosafety level 3 facility of the Research Center for Animal Life Science, Shiga

293

University of Medical Science.

294

VeroE6 cells were grown in MEM supplemented with 10% inactivated fetal bovine serum

295

(Capricorn Scientific GmbH), penicillin (100 units/mL), and streptomycin (100 µg/mL) (Nacalai

296

Tesque). To assess virus replication, serial dilutions of swab samples and tissue homogenate

297

samples (10% w/v) were inoculated onto confluent VeroE6 cells. The VeroE6 cells were cultured in

298

MEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA, penicillin, streptomycin, gentamycin (50 μg/mL) (Fuji Film,

299

Tokyo, Japan), and trypsin (5 μg/mL) (Nacalai Tesque). Cytopathic effects were examined under a

300

microscope 6 days later.

301
302

Histopathological examination

303

For histopathological examination, tissues obtained at autopsy were immersed in 10% neutral

304

buffered formalin for fixation, embedded in paraffin, and cut to 3-μm-thick sections on glass slides.

305

The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) and observed under a light

306

microscope.

307
308

Blood cytokine and biochemical analyses

309

Levels of cytokines/chemokines in macaque plasma were measured using the Milliplex MAP

310

non-human primate cytokine panel and Luminex 200 (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA) following the

311

manufacturer’s instructions. Blood biochemical analysis and blood cell counts were performed

312

using VetScan VS2 and HM2, respectively (Abaxis, Inc., Union City, CA).

313
314

Virus neutralization assay

315

Plasma samples were pretreated with a receptor-destroying enzyme (RDEII, Denka Seiken,

316

Tokyo, Japan) at 37°C overnight and then inactivated at 56°C for 1 h. The diluted samples were

317

mixed with 100 TCID50/well of the WK-521 strain for 30 min. Then the mixture was added onto a

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.18.256446; this version posted August 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

318

VeroE6 monolayer in 96-well plates. After 1-h incubation, the cells were cultured in MEM

319

containing 0.1% BSA and 5 μg/mL trypsin. After incubation at 37°C for 6 days, the number of wells

320

with cytopathic effects was counted in quadruplicate culture. Neutralization titers were expressed as

321

the dilution in which cytopathic effects were observed in 50% of the wells.

322
323

Detection of an antibody against SARS-CoV-2

324

Plasma were collected on indicated days. A COVID-19 IgG/IgM immunodetection kit (Novus

325

Biologicals USA, Centennial, CO) was used for detection of IgG and IgM specific for SARS-CoV-2

326

S and N proteins. Monkey IgM seemed not to react to the human IgM detection system.

327
328

Detection of cytokine-producing cells in ELISPOT

329

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells after separation from red blood cells were stored at -80°C

330

until use. Thawed cells (5 × 105/well) were cultured with a peptide pool of SARS-CoV-2 N protein

331

(0.6 nmol/mL) (PepTivator, Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) in the presence of

332

anti-CD28 antibody (0.1 µg/mL) overnight in ELISPOT plates coated with anti-IFN-γ and IL-2

333

antibodies (Cellular Technology Limited, Shaker Heights, OH). The number of cytokine-producing

334

cells was counted according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Peripheral blood cells collected from macaques (A) CE0202M, (B) CE0324F, and (C) CE1242F on the
indicated days were cultured for 24 h with peptides derived from SARS-CoV-2 N protein. The numbers
of IFN-γ-positive and IL-2-positive cells were counted using an ELISPOT analyzer. Peptide-specific
responses were indicated as a stimulation index = number of spots in the culture with peptides/number of
spots in the culture without peptides. Left y-axis: stimulation index of IFN-γ, right y-axis: stimulation
index of IL-2. Blue and red dotted lines indicate stimulation indexes 2 in IFN-γ and IL-2, respectively.
Stimulation indexes higher than 2 are thought as responses specific for peptide antigens.
