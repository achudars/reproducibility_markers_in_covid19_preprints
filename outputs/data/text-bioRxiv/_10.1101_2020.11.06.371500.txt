Abstract
The leukotriene receptor antagonist Montelukast (MTK) is an approved medication for the
treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis. The existing marketed tablet forms of MTK exhibit
inconsistent uptake and bioavailability, which partially explains the presence of a significant
proportion of MTK low- and non-responders in the population. Besides that, tablets are
suboptimal formulations for patients suffering of dysphagia, for example seen in COVID-19
patients or in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease. The
increasing interest in repurposing of MTK for the treatment of such patients and the need for an
improved bioavailability triggered us to reformulate MTK. The aim was to develop a
mucoadhesive MTK film with a good safety and improved pharmacological, i.e. improved
bioavailability, profile in humans as well as in a mouse model of Alzheimer´s Disease.
We tested dissolution of the mucoadhesive film containing MTK in saliva buffer and assessed
pharmacoexposure and –kinetics after acute and chronic oral application in mice. Furthermore,
we performed a Phase I safety / bioavailability / pharmacokinetic analysis in healthy volunteers.
The latter included a comparison with the marketed tablet form as well as a quantitative analysis
of the MTK levels in the cerebrospinal fluid.
The novel MTK film demonstrated significantly improved bioavailability compared to the
marketed tablet in the clinical phase 1a study in healthy humans. Furthermore, there were
measurable amounts of MTK present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at the 3.0 and 7.0 hour
time points post drug administration in humans. In mice, MTK was detected in serum and CSF
after acute and chronic exposure in a dose-dependent manner.
The developed mucoadhesive film of MTK represents a promising alternative for the tablet
delivery. The oral film might lower the non-responder rate in patients with asthma and might be
an interesting product for repurposing of MTK in other diseases. As we demonstrate BBB
penetrance in a preclinical model as well as in a clinical study, the oral film of MTK might find its
use as a therapeutic for acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as dementias and
stroke.

Introduction
Montelukast (MTK) is a leukotriene receptor antagonist commonly used to treat patients
suffering from chronic asthma as well as seasonal allergies and allergic rhinitis. MTK binds to
the cysteinyl-leukotriene receptor 1 and to the leukotriene receptor GPR17 with high affinity and
selectivity, thereby blocking the leukotriene signaling pathway1,2. It reduces leukotriene-mediated
respiratory inflammation reaction such as vasoconstriction and relieves asthma symptoms3.
Currently, MTK is marketed under the brand name Singulair® and in several generic products in
oral tablet and other pharmaceutical forms such as oral granules. The available forms present a
number of limitations such as inconsistent solubility, uptake, and bioavailability, for several
reasons. Although MTK is freely soluble in water, its solubility increases significantly above pH
7.5 and drastically reduces under acidic conditions normally found in the gastrointestinal tract, in
particular in the stomach4. This has led to relatively slow and inconsistent absorption into the
blood stream, with maximum concentrations occurring between 2-4 hours following
consumption, thereby limiting its use to chronic applications rather than for rapid acute
treatment. Uptake and bioavailability of MTK is further determined by pharmacogenetics (for
review see 5). For example, more than 20% of the population is not responding to MTK with a
clinical benefit 6. Among the various genetic reasons are variations in the SLCO2B1 gene coding
for the organic anion transporting OATP2B1, which has been associated with altered absorption
of MTK7. Uptake of MTK was further modified by the intake of citrus juice8. Besides the physicochemical and genetic basis for the insufficient uptake and bioavailability of MTK in its current
tablet form, a further drawback is the inadequateness of the MTK tablets for patients suffering
from dysphagia such as elderly patient, for patients with dementias, and for patients that require
intubation or ventilation. In summary, the tablet form of MTK represent a number of limitations,
and in consequence, there is an increasing interest in developing improved strategies for the
delivery of MTK aiming for increased bioavailability9.
Oral mucoadhesive application has several advantages, such as the relatively easy and
convenient accessibility of the oral cavity, the limiting of first-pass effects and degradation during
the gastro-intestinal transit and the rapid drug absorption due to high blood circulation in the
mucosa (as reviewed in

10,11

). In general, buccal films are seen as a promising alternative

application route for drugs as they combine several features, like better patient compliance (no
swallowing and the possibility to modify the taste) and increased bioavailability (reviewed in 12).
We developed a novel MTK oral mucoadhesive film to circumvent the limitations of MTK in its
tablet form, tested its stability and dissolution, and performed a Phase I bioavailability and safety
study in healthy volunteers, where we assessed MTK pharmacokinetics in serum and

cerebrospinal fluid. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate the possibility of repurposing MTK in
form of the novel oral film for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). To test its suitability for a pre-clinical
efficacy study of MTK in AD we assessed pharmacokinetics and tested the effects of acute and
chronic application on pharmacoexposure in an animal model of AD, the 5xFAD mouse model.

Materials and Methods
Film Preparation
The mucoadhesive films were produced by a solvent-casting technique. For that, excipients and
active pharmacological ingredient (API) in a range from 0 – 30.00 % (w/w) were mixed and
dissolved/suspended in water. The resulting wet blend was spread to a thickness less than 1
mm onto a release liner. The wet film was dried in an oven for 60-75 minutes at 65°C. The dried
film sheet was cut into film strips containing 10 mg of MTK. The composition of the film is
depicted in table 1.
In vitro dissolution test
Dissolution studies were carried out in a paddle type apparatus at 50 rpm and 37°C. Dissolution
of MTK tablet, MTK mucoadhesive film and pre-solubilized MTK oral film was assessed in 900
mL of phosphate based saliva buffer (pH 6.8), For the dissolution test of pre-solubilized MTK
film, a single film unit was mixed with 2 mL of saliva buffer pH 6.8 for 5 min and directly injected
into the dissolution chamber. Aliquots of the release medium (8 mL) were collected at the
following time points: 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45 minutes and analyzed by HPLC UV at 255
nm as specify in the USP.
Mechanical properties
To determine potential impact of cold temperature during transport films containing 10 mg MTK
were placed at -20°C for 15 and 30 days, respectively and were compared to a control product
unexposed to cold temperature. The mechanical properties were evaluated by testing 3 films for
folding endurance, and 8 films for elongation and tensile strength. A Mecmesin Multitest 1-d
force testing system (SN 09-1004-11), including a Mecmesin Advanced Force Gauge 50N (SN
09-0071-11), was used to perform the tests. The flexibility of a film was assessed by repeatedly
folding the film at the same place until cracking or breakage. The number of times the film was
folded without breaking was recorded as the folding endurance value. A film strip was fixed at
half-length on the bottom grip of the instrument, and then folded 10 times in both directions.
Elongation at break was measured by stretching the film to its maximum deformation until it torn
apart. The test was carried out by affixing a film by its ends to the grips of a Mecmesin Multitest
1-d instrument and stretched at a constant speed of 10 mm/min until it cracked or broke. The
length of the film section was measured before and after stretching. Elongation is defined as the
ratio between the increase in film length as result of stretching, and the initial length of the film,
expressed as a percentage of the initial length. Tensile strength was determined simultaneously

with the elongation test and is defined as the maximum force applied to the film area being
stretched. All tests were performed in a room with controlled temperature and humidity.
Clinical Study – Subjects and Study Design
To determine the bioequivalence of MTK 10 mg mucoadhesive film (test drug - treatment A) and
Singulair® 10 mg film-coated tablet (Merck Sharp &Dome) (reference drug – treatment B) a
single-dose, randomized, Open-Label, Two Way Crossover comparative bioavailability pilot
study was conducted in volunteers under fasting conditions (ethical approvement number

MOD00167465). The clinic study was performed by BioPharma Services Inc (BPSI) (Toronto,
Canada) and included 8 healthy non-smokers (for at least 6 months prior to first drug
administration) male and non-pregnant female volunteers, with 18 years of age or older and a
body mass index (BMI) within 18.5-29.9 kg/m2. To assess clinical health of the participants

.

several laboratory tests were performed Screenings included demographic data, medical and
medication histories, physical examinations, body measurements, vital signs (seated blood
pressure [BP], heart rate [HR], respiratory rate [RR] and temperature), electrocardiogram (ECG),
hematology, biochemistry, serology, urinalysis, urine screening for drugs of abuse and cotinine,
alcohol test and serum pregnancy test (for full list of clinical laboratory assessment see
supplementary table 1). Clinical laboratory values needed to be within BPSI’s acceptable range.
A single dose of 10 mg MTK of either formulation was administered under fasting conditions.
Blood sampling (4 mL) was performed 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, 3.25, 3.5, 3.75, 4, 4.25, 4.5,
5, 5.5, 6, 8,12 and 24 hours after dosing using a K2EDTA Vacutainer®. Additionally, CSF
samples were taken 3.0 and 7.0 hours post-dose in study period 1. Participants were housed at
least 10 hours prior to dosing and until 12 hours post-dose. The confinement period lasted in
total at least 22 hours for each study period, with occurrence of adverse effects being closed
monitored during this period. An investigator was present from approximately 30 minutes prior to
dosing and until at least 12 hours (study period 1) or 4 hours (study period 2) after the last
subject was dosed. The investigator remained on-call throughout the duration of the study. For
safety, in each study period, vital signs (blood pressure [BP] and heart rate [HR]) were
monitored before dosing and 3 and 24 hours post-dosing. The study lasted for at least 2 weeks
from the study period 1 check-in, compromising a washout interval of minimum 7 days between
the two clinical phases.
Animals
Acute exposure experiment: Two-month old C57BL6 female mice (n=10) were treated with a
single dose of MTK mucoadhesive film. One group (n= 5) received a dose of 3,3 mg/kg/d of

MTK and another group (n=5) received 10 mg/kg/d of MTK. The respective films were punched
out of an initial film into circular films using punch pliers with 3 mm diameter, which results in an
area of 7 mm2 per film. Based on the area of the film punch we had calculated the different
concentrations of MTK in the initial film to reach 3.3 mg/kg/d and 10 mg/kg/d respectively in a 25
g mouse with one 7mm2 film. For oral treatment mice were hold in the mouse grip and the film
was placed on the oral mucosa using riffled forceps with a 0.5 diameter at the tip.
To assess serum levels of MTK blood samples were collected one, three and seven hours after
the beginning of treatment (Fig 4A). For the first two time points blood was taken from the medial
saphenous vein and for the last one by cardiac puncture. Mice were housed at the Paracelsus
Medical University Salzburg in groups under standard conditions at a temperature of 22 °C and
a 12 h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to standard food and water. This study was
approved by local Austrian ethical authorities (BMBWF-66.019/0019-V/3b/2018).

, which have three mutations in the

gene for APP695 [APP K670N/M671L (Swedish), I716V (Florida), V717I (London)] and two
mutations in the gene for PS1 [M146L, L286V] under the expression of the Thy1 promotor, were
used for this experiment Mice were housed at the animal facility of QPS Austria in groups under
standard conditions with constant 12 h light/dark cycle, at a room temperature of 24°C , relative
humidity of 40-70% and ad libitum access to standard rodent chow (altrumin) and water. The
experiment was approved by local ethical committees (ABT13-14688/2018-4) and conducted at
QPS. In this study, 5-months old animals (n=44) were treated daily with MTK mucoadhesive film
for 13 weeks (Fig 4B). The film was placed on the mice buccal mucosa and the two different
doses were used 3.3 mg/kg/d MTK (referred to as low dose) or 10 mg/kg/d MTK (referred to as
high dose). As a control, animals received vehicle treatment (film without API).

Quantitative assessment of MTK in –plasma and CSF human samples
Serum and CSF was prepared as described in our previous work

14

. Samples were analyzed

using an Agilent 1290 Infinity binary pump and autosampler with detection by an Agilent 6550
iFunnel QTof mass spectrometer (MS) (Agilent) using electrospray ionisation. The protonated
molecules for MTK and tolbutamide (m/z 586.2177 and m/z 271.1116) were extracted with ±15
ppm mass windows to generate chromatograms with suitable combinations of specificity and
signal/noise. Sample aliquots (5 µL) were injected into a mobile phase initially of 98% water /
0.1% formic acid (Channel A) and 2% acetonitrile / 0.1% formic acid (Channel B) delivered at 0.4
mL /min to an Acquity BEH C18 50 x 2.1mm, 1.7 µm column. The column was maintained at
50°C in an Agilent Infinity column oven. The mobile phase composition was programmed to

change linearly from 2% Channel B at 0.30 min post-injection up to 95% at 1.10 min, maintained
at 95% until 1.75 min, and then returning to initial composition at 1.8 min. Column effluent was
diverted to waste for the first 0.8 min post-injection to minimise source contamination. Data
processing: MassHunter software (v B.05.01, Agilent UK). Calibration curves were fitted using
the simplest regression model to minimize back-calculated calibration standard concentration
residuals over the range of study sample concentrations.
Quantitative assessment of MTK in –serum and CSF mouse samples (HPLC-MS/MS)
The LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of montelukast in serum and CSF was described
earlier15 with a modified sample preparation as used in16. Briefly, sample preparation consisted
of a simple protein precipitation protocol. Therefore, 12.5 μL 100% FA were added to 50 μL of
serum or CSF, vortexed briefly before the addition of 150 μL 100% ACN containing MTK-d6 as
internal standard. After vortexing for two minutes, all samples were centrifuged at 10 500 x g for
10 minutes at 4°C. For serum samples, 20 μL of the clear supernatant were added to 40 μL of
mobile phase A (1 mM ammonium formate in water containing 0.1% FA). The supernatants (180

μL) of CSF extraction were dried under a constant nitrogen flow at 45°C. Completely dried
samples were reconstituted with 60 μL 1 mM ammonium formate in 25/75 (vol/vol)
acetonitrile/water containing 0.1% FA. Chromatographic separation was carried out on an
Agilent 1200 series quaternary HPLC system using a Chromolith Performance RP18-e column
(100x3 mm) from Merck operated a temperature of 45°C with 1 mM ammonium formate in water
containing 0.1% FA as mobile phase A and 1 mM ammonium formate in 95/5 (vol/vol)
acetonitrile/water containing 0.1% FA as mobile phase B. Gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.5
mL/min started from 25.0% to 95.0% B in 10.0 min, followed by a flushing step with 95.0% B for
0.8 min followed by an re-equilibration step with 25.0% B for 3.2 min. Total time for a single
chromatographic run was 14.0 min. Injection volumes of 20 μL for serum and 30 μL for CSF
samples were chosen. Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) measurements for MTK as well as
for the d6-internal standard in obtained samples were performed on an API 4000 LC-MS/MS
triple quadrupole system in positive ionisation mode. The quantifier ion transitions of MS/MS
detection were m/z 586.2 to 568.2 for MTK and m/z 592.2 to 574.4 for MTK-d6. Calibration
curves were derived from ratios of the peak areas of MTK and the internal standard using 1/χweighted linear least-squares regression of the area ratio versus the concentration of the
corresponding internal standard MTK-d6. Analyst software 1.6.2 was used for detection, analysis
and quantification of data.
Statistical Analysis

For statistical analysis of the human data, analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used for lntransformed AUCt, AUCinf and Cmax, and untransformed Tmax, λ and T1/2. Tmax was also
analyzed using an additional nonparametric test (Wilcoxon test). The 90% confidence intervals
(CI) for the Test/Reference ratios of geometric means for AUCt, AUCinf and Cmax were
calculated based on the least square means (LSMEANS) and ESTIMATE of the ANOVA.
For statistical analysis of the animal data, Prism 8 software (GraphPad) was used. The data
were tested for normal distribution with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For comparison of two
groups an unpaired t test was performed, whereas for comparison of more than two groups,
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used with Tukey’s or Bonferroni’s multiple
comparison test as a post-hoc test. The data were depicted as mean and standard error of the
mean (SEM) or standard deviation (SD) with a 95% confidence interval as indicated in the
respective figure legends. P values of p < 0.0001 and p < 0.001 were considered extremely
significant (**** or ***), p < 0.01 very significant (**) and p < 0.05 significant (*).

Results
Composition, preparation, physical and mechanical properties of the MTK mucoadhesive film
Besides the active pharmacological ingredient, the general composition of the film blend
includes 60.0 – 85.0 %w/w wet of water as solvent and 5.0 -15.0 %w/w wet mucoadhesive
polymer to form the film. Furthermore, it includes gum to modify viscosity, stabilizers to prevent
degradation, plasticizers to tune mechanical properties, permeation enhancers to increase
absorption and colorant and flavor for patient compliance (table 1).
The film was prepared using a solvent-casting technique, where excipients and active
pharmacological ingredient (API) were mixed, dissolved in water and spread out to a thin layer
that was dried and then cut into strips with a concentration of 10 mg of MTK per strip.
To assess the impact of exposure to freezing conditions on the mechanical properties of 10 mg
MTK film, films were tested for folding endurance, elongation and tensile strength at T0 as well
as after 15 and 30 days at -20°C (table 2). Results of folding endurance testing showed that
films from all three conditions can be folded at least 10 times without tearing and therefore meet
the acceptance criteria of the folding test. A one-way ANOVA analysis was performed to
compare the elongation mean values of the three conditions. At a α=0.05 significance level the
elongation data from films exposed to freezing conditions are not significantly different to the

initial product (T0). A similar statistical analysis was applied to the tensile strength data and also
revealed no significant differences between the three stability conditions.
These results show that the 10 mg MTK film has stable mechanical properties under freezing
conditions for at least 30 days. Therefore, the integrity and quality of the film product are
maintained in case to exposure to low temperatures during air transport of the films from the
manufacturing site to the location where the clinical study would take place.

Dissolution
Release of MTK from films was compared to Singulair® tablets using a USP grade dissolution
apparatus (Fig 1, table 3). In general, the dissolution experiments were conducted using a 10 mg
dosage unit of either film or tablet. In these experiments, MTK release from coated tablets is
compared to that from the mucoadhesive film and pre-solubilized film. The use of a “presolubilized” form of film simulated the condition in which the film, after applied in the oral
mucosa, starts to slowly dissolve in saliva and is swallowed.
With MTK-film 80% of the API was released after approximately 6 minutes, while with the tablets
an equivalent release was only achieved after 10 minutes. This highlights the rapid oral
disintegration advantage of the film based platform. However, the most significant improvement
using the film technology is observed when comparing the tablet to the pre-solubilized MTK-film.
This experiment is particularly informative as it is a direct comparison of how API is released
from swallowed MTK-tablets versus swallowed dissolved oral films under the same
environmental conditions. This is important, as we cannot exclude that some patients, instead of
placing the film on the mouth mucosa, might swallow the film. As a result, the pre-solubilized
MTK-film reaches 80% released API in only approximately 1 minute, whereas the tablet reaches
80% released API after 10 minutes. This clearly demonstrates how the orally pre-solubilized
MTK-film platform releases API more quickly than the MTK-tablet dosage in the stomach.
Improved MTK bioavailability in human plasma and CSF in MTK mucoadhesive film
We have performed a phase 1 clinical study in healthy human subjects to determine the
pharmacokinetics of MTK administered in form of an oral film product compared to the marketed
reference product Singulair® which both contained 10 mg MTK free base (Fig 2). Enrolled
subjects had a mean age of 44 years and a mean BMI of 26 kg/m2 (table 4). Pharmacokinetic
parameters of MTK in plasma were collected for each subject individually and are summarized in
table 5.

The area under the concentration-time curve (AUCt), measured from timepoint zero until the last
sampling timepoint at 24 h, was significantly higher after the film (AUCt = 3673 ng*h/ml) than
after the tablet (AUCt = 2409 ng*h/ml). The calculated film to tablet geometric mean ratio was
152.46% demonstrating a significantly higher extent of absorption after the film compared to the
tablet. Similar results were obtained for the AUCinf, measured from timepoint zero to infinity,
calculated as AUCt + Clast/λ, where Clast is the last measurable concentration of MTK. The ratio
of film to tablet was 153.15 %, again demonstrating significant higher extent of absorption of the
film. Mean pharmacokinetic plasma profiles of MTK for both products over time are shown in
figure 3. The geometric mean of Cmax was 338 ng/ml after treatment with Singulair® and 554
ng/ml after treatment with the film (Fig 3). Tmax was reached at 3.63 hrs after Singulair® and at
2.63 hrs after the film (Fig 3). These results indicate that the MTK film has approximately 1.5
times the Cmax and AUC (area under the curve) values compared to the Singulair® reference.
This indicates that using equivalent API loading, the MTK mucoadhesive film exhibits
significantly improved bioavailability. Furthermore, treatment with the film had a one hour earlier
Tmax than the tablet.
Leukotriene blockers (i.e., leukotriene receptor antagonists and leukotriene synthesis inhibitors)
can function to improve cognitive impairment by reducing the neuroinflammatory response within
the brain (reviewed in

17-19

). Leukotriene blockers, such as MTK, must therefore cross the blood-

brain barrier and accumulate in the CSF. To investigate the ability of MTK to cross of the bloodbrain barrier in humans, CSF levels of MTK were measured 3 and 7 hours after dosing with the
MTK mucoadhesive film. Measurable amounts, ranging from 3.2 – 4.7 ng/ml of MTK in the CSF
were detected at both time points (table 6). A comparison of the mean concentrations of MTK in
the CSF three hours (3.6 ng/ml) and seven hours (4.2 ng/ml) after application reveals a slower
and different pharmacokinetic profile in the CSF than in the serum, where Cmax was reached
after approximately 2.7 hours after application. Although, compared to serum levels the
concentration of MTK in the CSF is lower, but could be more stable over time. As the mean
concentration is slightly higher after seven hours than after three hours we might not have
reached Cmax after seven hours. However, further studies with longer periods of observation
are needed to monitor the temporal profile of MTK pharmacokinetics in the CSF in more detail.
Clinical safety
Six mild adverse effects (AEs), including somnolence, headache, pruritus, mechanical urticaria
and back pain, were experienced by the subjects after taking MTK mucoadhesive film (table 7),
four of which (pruritus, mechanical urticaria, headache and backpain) were classified as

unrelated or unlikely related to drug (table 8). The mild AEs that were classified as possibly
related to the drug were somnolence reported by two subjects. No AEs were reported by the
subjects after taking the reference product (table 7). No serious adverse events were reported
during the conduct of this study (table 8).
Pharmacoexposure and -kinetics of MTK in WT and in 5xFAD mice
As outlined in the introduction, there is a current interest in repurposing of MTK for the treatment
of patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia patients
patients

22,23

17,20,21

, and of COVID-19

. Both show dysphagia, and therefore, a mucoadhesive film might have certain

advantages. Especially for repurposing of MTK in neurodegenerative diseases, preclinical
evidence of efficacy in rodent models is typically required. Therefore, we tested the MTK buccal
mucoadhesive film in the context of the present study for its pharmacoexposure and –kinetic
profile in mice, healthy WT mice and 5-FAD mice, a mouse model of genetic AD. We first briefly
assessed the serum pharmacokinetics of the buccal MTK film in 2 months old female C57bl6
wildtype (WT) mice. In a short-term pharmacokinetic experiment, WT animals received one dose
of film (Fig 4A) with either 3.3 mg/kg/d (referred to as low dose) or 10 mg/kg/d (referred to as
high dose) of MTK (Fig 4B). Regardless of the dose, the highest MTK concentration in serum
was detected 1 hour post-dosing, whereas measurements 3 and 7 hours after the film
application showed decreased MTK serum concentrations with time (Fig 5A). The animals
receiving the high dose treatment showed, in general, higher MTK serum concentrations (Fig
5A). Next, we analyzed MTK serum concentration in 5 months old 5xFAD animals after chronic
exposure. For that, animals were treated daily for 13 weeks with vehicle, low or high dose of
MTK (Fig 4C), and serum MTK levels were assessed 7 hours after the last dose (Fig 5B). MTK
serum levels were dose-dependent, with animals in the higher dose treatment group showing
significantly higher serum concentrations compared to the animals in the lower dose treatment
group (low dose: 103.7 ± 15.51 ng/ml, high dose 360.9± 67.5 ng/ml) (Fig 5B). As expected, in
the vehicle treated group no MTK was detected in the serum (Fig 5B). Interestingly, MTK serum
levels after chronic exposure were significantly higher in comparison with the serum
concentrations determined 7-hours after a single dose administration (acute pharmacoexposure)
(Fig 5C).
As a proof of concept we also analyzed MTK concentration in the CSF after chronic exposure
and detected higher levels in the high-dose group than in the low dose group and no MTK in the
vehicle group (Fig 5D), demonstrating again the ability of MTK to cross the BBB.
Safety and general health in mice

General health status of the animals was monitored during the chronic exposure study by weekly
bodyweight assessment. Mean bodyweight was stable through the experiment (Fig 6A), with
individual bodyweight fluctuating less than approximately 10 % of the initial bodyweight from
week to week (Fig 6B). Mean bodyweight did not significantly differ between treatment groups
(Fig 6C). Furthermore, the fecal motility of the animals was monitored for 20 minutes. There was
no significant difference in the number of fecal boli between the groups (Fig 6D) showing no
effect of the new formulation of MTK on fecal motility in 5xFAD mice. In summary, we conclude
that prolonged treatment with low and high dose of MTK did not negatively affect general health
of mice and no adverse events have occurred in mice.
Discussion
Montelukast is an approved anti-allergic and anti-asthmatic drug which is commercialized only
as solid dosage forms, in particular tablets. The limited number of MTK dosage forms available
is associated to its physico-chemical properties and sensitivity to light, humidity, temperature
and oxidation9. The commercialization of MTK in tablet forms might compromise patient
adhesion to treatment among groups with swallowing difficulties such as elderly and children, or
patients which require intubation / ventilation such as severe COVID-19 patients. Oral
mucoadhesive films circumvent some of the limitations of solid tablets, like swallowing problems,
and could be a promising alternative for MTK treatment with an improved patient compliance. In
the present study we used for the first time a novel formulation of MTK, i.e. a mucoadhesive film,
designed to be applied in the oral mucosa, in human and mice.
First, we compared the bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profile of MTK mucoadhesive relative
to the reference formulation, Singulair® tablets. For equivalent drug loadings (10mg), MTK
mucoadhesive film exhibits 50% better bioavailability compared to MTK tablets. The superior
bioavailability of the MTK mucoadhesive film might be related to (1) sublingual MTK absorption,
and/or (2) improved drug release. When applied in the oral mucosa, MTK mucoadhesive film
releases the drug into the oral cavity, where it can be absorbed sublingually. By favoring pregastric absorption, MTK mucoadhesive film might limit first pass effects resulting in an increased
bioavailability 9.Furthermore, as we show in vitro, the mucoadhesive film releases MTK twice as
fast as the tablets, which could as well contribute to an increased MTK bioavailability. Alongside
to its potential to improve patient compliance, this new formulation opens possibilities for the
development of films containing a lower drug loading bioequivalent to the current reference
formulation, Singulair® tablets. Additionally, as MTK mucoadhesive film shows earlier Tmax and
greater Cmax compared to tablets, it might receive new indications, such as the treatment of
acute allergic symptoms, in which a quick drug release and onset of action are desired.

As evidence arises from animal experiments and from case reports that MTK might be a
valuable therapeutic in the field of neurodegenerative diseases18-21,24, we found it relevant to
investigate whether MTK can be detected in human CSF, as a proof of concept that MTK can
pass the blood-brain barrier in humans. After a single dose treatment with MTK mucoadhesive
film we detected MTK in the CSF of healthy subjects in a pharmacological relevant dose in the
range of the IC50 (MTK IC50 < 5nM

25

). The initial results indicate that Tmax could in fact be

delayed in comparison to the plasma level results. This may indicate that MTK accumulates in
the CSF faster than its clearance. This is significant as it would allow a once a day dosing to
maintain therapeutic CSF concentrations rather than multiple times in a single day, thereby
improving patient compliance. Further clinical studies are needed to determine the
pharmacokinetics of CSF accumulation and clearance of MTK, as, due to its invasiveness, CSF
sampling was limited to two time points.
Montelukast was approved in 1998 for the treatment of chronic asthma and is generally well
tolerated. In the safety meta-analysis of the 11 multicentre, randomized, controlled studies
conducted by Storms et. al., (2001) a total of 3,386 adult patients (aged > 15 years) and 336
pediatric patients (6 to 14 years) were enrolled. From the total adult population 1,955 patients
received montelukast and the remaining 1,431 were on placebo or an active comparator (inhaled
beclomethasone). In the meta-analysis, discontinuation as a result of Adverse Events (AE)
occurred in 3.7% (73 out of 1,955) adult patients treated with montelukast and 5.2% (61 out of
1,180) receiving placebo. It was also noted that there were no notable clinical differences in the
frequency of reported AEs between patients receiving montelukast from those receiving placebo.
The most common and frequently reported AE in the montelukast and placebo groups were
upper respiratory infection, asthma, and headache. In total, the incidence of patients reporting
an AE was 66.5% (1,300) with montelukast and 71.3% (841) with placebo. In 2 of 4 extension
studies in the pooled analysis, no increase in treatment discontinuation or frequency of clinical or
laboratory AEs were seen in patients receiving montelukast at substantially higher doses than
the marketed 10-mg dose. In these 2 studies, patients received montelukast at 200 mg for 22
weeks, 100 mg for 12 weeks and 50 mg for 28 weeks with no observed change in the safety or
tolerability profile. In all 4 extension studies, the total continuous exposure to montelukast for the
adults was 698 patients for up to 6 months, 525 patients for at least 1 year, 152 patients for at
least 2 years and 25 for up to 3 years, providing an overall exposure of 734 patient years26. In
the study presented herein six adverse events were documented occurring after taking the MTK
film. Two study subjects experienced somnolence, which was possibly related to MTK. The other
adverse events were classified as unlikely related and unrelated to MTK. Sleep disturbances,

especially nightmares, have been reported after the use of MTK in asthma patients in children,
but also in adults (reviewed in 27), but they stop shortly after discontinuation of the treatment28. A
retrospective study analyzing adverse reactions of MTK reported to the Netherlands
Pharmacovigilance Center Lareb and the WHO Global database, VigiBase® identified
aggression, nightmares and suicidal ideations as the most common reported adverse drug
reactions and highlighted the importance of informing patients and parents of the possibility of
neuropsychiatric side effects in the clinics 29. Of course, these neuropsychiatric side effects need
to be considered in future clinical studies, although they demonstrate possible effects of MTK on
the brain.
Secondly, we analyzed pharmacokinetics of MTK in a transgenic mouse model of AD, because
recently it was shown that pharmacological inhibition of leukotriene signaling had beneficial
effects in several mouse models of AD30-34. The leukotriene receptor antagonist MTK has been
proposed as an interesting candidate for drug repurposing in AD patients20,21,24, due to its
potential to modulate neuroinflammation and improve memory in animal models of stroke35,
epilepsy36,37 and lewy body dementia38. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms
underlying MTK action on CNS remain yet poorly understood and pre-clinical experiments are
needed to shade light onto its efficacy to modulate cognitive function. Here, we evaluated the
pharmacokinetics of MTK mucoadhesive film in rodents, after acute and chronic treatment
following different dosing and observed dose dependent MTK serum levels after acute and longterm treatment. Interestingly, MTK serum levels 7 hours post dosing were significantly lower
after a single dose of 10 mg/kg/d compared to MTK serum levels after 3 months of daily
treatment with the same dose. This suggest that MTK accumulates in the body during long-term
treatment, which might stabilize and/or prolong effects of MTK. However, as acute

pharmacoexposure experiments were performed in transgenic 5xFAD mice, we cannot
discharge the hypothesis, that the observed differences MTK pharmacokinetics are related to
the different genetic background of the mouse models used.
Interestingly, we could detect dose dependent concentrations of MTK in the CSF of 5xFAD mice
after chronic treatment. This constitutes an important prerequisite for future pre-clinical efficacy
studies of MTK and shows the relevance of the 5xFAD mouse model as a tool to better
understand the effects of MTK chronic treatment in AD. Overall, the results here presented, from
both human and mice studies, pave the way for larger clinical phase 2 study to determine the
efficacy of MTK to improve cognitive function in patients suffering from Alzheimer´s disease or to

alleviate symptoms seen in COVID-19 patients, which includes also neurological and cognitive
deficits39 (reviewed in 40) .
Conclusion
In summary we have demonstrated safety, convenience and improved bioavailability of MTK in
form of the mucoadhesive film compared to the coated tablet in humans. Furthermore, we
demonstrate BBB penetrance in a clinical study in human healthy subjects as well as in a
preclinical mouse model for Alzheimer`s disease. This paves the way for potential therapeutic
use of the oral mucoadhesive MTK film in acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases such
as Alzheimer´s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, stroke, spinal cord injuries, and other
diseases such as COVID-19.

AUCt: Area under the concentration-time curve from time zero until the last measurable
concentration or last sampling time t, whichever occurs first. AUCt is estimated using the
trapezoidal method. AUCt/AUCinf: The proportion of AUCinf covered by the actual sample
schedule. AUCinf: Area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity, calculated
as AUCt + Clast/λ, where Clast is the last measurable concentration. Cmax: The maximal
observed plasma concentration. Tmax: Time when the maximal plasma concentration is
observed.
