No evidence for basigin/CD147 as a direct SARS-CoV-2 spike binding receptor

Abstract
The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is known to enable viral invasion into human cells
through direct binding to host receptors including ACE2. An alternate entry receptor for the virus
was recently proposed to be basigin/CD147. These early studies have already prompted a
clinical trial and multiple published hypotheses of the role of this host receptor in viral infection
and pathogenesis. We sought to independently characterize the basigin-spike protein
interaction. After conducting several lines of experiments, we report that we are unable to find
evidence supporting the role of basigin as a putative spike-binding receptor. Recombinant forms
of both the entire ectodomain and S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that directly bind
ACE2 do not interact with basigin expressed on the surface of human cells. Using specialized
assays tailored to detect receptor interactions as weak or weaker than the proposed
basigin-spike binding, we report no evidence for direct binding of the viral spike to either of the
two common isoforms of basigin. Given the pressing need for clarity on which targets of
SARS-CoV-2 may lead to promising therapeutics, we present these findings to allow more
informed decisions about the translational relevance of this putative mechanism in the race to
understand and treat COVID-19.

Introduction
The sudden emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 has demanded extensive research
be directed to resolve the many unknown aspects of this previously-unknown virus. One
essential question is what host factors the virus uses to recognize and invade human cells.
SARS-CoV-2, as with other members of the coronavirus family, invades host cells using the
large trimeric spike proteins on their surfaces. A series of studies published within the first
months of the COVID-19 pandemic independently confirmed that the same
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor that was found to mediate SARS spike
binding to human cells also mediates SARS-CoV-2 binding to human cells​1–3​. However, for
previous coronaviruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 including SARS and MERS, multiple
different host receptors have been described with roles facilitating viral invasion​4–7​, making it
plausible that additional interaction partners for the SARS-CoV-2 spike may remain
undiscovered. Among the most prominent claims for an alternate SARS-CoV-2 host receptor
comes from a report identifying basigin (CD147) as a binding partner for the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein with functional significance in viral invasion​9​. Based on a previously-published indirect
interaction between the SARS spike protein and cyclophilin A for which basigin appeared to be
involved, basigin was subsequently found to directly bind the spike SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
with reasonably high affinity (185 nM, compared to 5-20 nM reported for the similarly
high-affinity spike-ACE2 binding​2,10​). Direct binding between the SARS-CoV-2 spike

“receptor-binding region” of the S1 domain and basigin was demonstrated in those reports by
co-immunoprecipitation, surface plasmon resonance, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assays (ELISAs).
Notably, the original finding that basigin is a possible alternative SARS-CoV-2 receptor
has already translated into an open-label clinical trial of a humanized therapeutic monoclonal
antibody against basigin, meplazumab, which reported striking improvements in COVID-19
patients treated with antibody​8​. Basigin represents an attractive medical target because
therapeutic agents have already been developed that target basigin based on basigin’s
previously-established role as an essential host receptor for invasion of the malaria parasite
Plasmodium falciparum11,12​
​ . The claim that basigin acts as a host receptor for SARS-CoV-2 has
already featured in published articles discussing the prioritization of therapeutics​13​, and has
been the subject of published analyses looking at basigin expression on the assumption that it
serves as a viral entry factor​14–16​.
We sought to validate the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and
human basigin after observing that the result had not yet been reproduced despite intense
interest in the interaction’s proposed consequences. Using a variety of sensitive approaches for
detecting binding interactions and validated reagents, we were unable to find any supporting
evidence for a direct interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with basigin. Based on our
findings, we encourage caution in approaches aimed at addressing the current pandemic
caused by SARS-CoV-2 which are rooted in the assumption that basigin acts as a viral
recognition receptor without further evidence.

Results
We first investigated whether basigin (BSG) expressed on the surface of human cell
lines could bind the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The previous reports of this interaction had
not performed any binding experiments on full-length basigin displayed on the surface of cells​9​.
First, we synthesized constructs to recombinantly express the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. We
emulated the published designs of spike constructs previously determined to be folded and
functional​17​. Using a mammalian HEK293 expression system to increase the chances that
preserve structurally-critical post-translational modifications would be preserved​18​, we produced
both the full extracellular domain of the spike protein, and the S1 domain of the spike that
mediates all known receptor binding events (Figure 1A). When HEK293 cells were transiently
transfected with cDNA overexpression plasmids for ACE2, the transfected cells became strongly
stained by fluorescent tetramers of spike protein in either S1 and full forms (Figure 1B).
However, no similar gain of binding was observed with HEK293 cells transfected with BSG
cDNA. We also noted that these HEK293 cell lines express BSG at high levels even without
cDNA overexpression (Figure 1C), yet despite this spike protein tetramers had no detectable
background staining of our HEK293 cells without ACE2 in either our experiment or similar
experiments reported with SARS-CoV-2 and HEK293 cells​19–21​.

Next, we sought to leverage the high sensitivity of direct biochemical binding assays to
determine if these methods could detect any traces of basigin binding. We have previously
expressed the ectodomain of the basigin receptor in a functionally active form and used it to
discover pathogen ligands including ​Plasmodium falciparum RH5​11,22–23​. In a HEK293 human
cell line, we expressed recombinant forms of the extracellular domains of both the canonical
isoforms of basigin (BSG) that contains two Ig-like domains and the alternate isoform which
contains an additional Ig-like domain (BSG-long) (Figure 2A). To confirm our recombinant
constructs were folded and biochemically active, we probed the basigin constructs with three
different monoclonal antibodies known to bind native basigin at the cell surface​12,25 in
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). All antibodies specifically bound to both of our
recombinant basigin isoforms but not a negative control construct of recombinant rat Cd4 tag
(Figure 2B). The protein epitopes recognized by these antibodies retained their conformation in
recombinant basigin but less so in basigin that is denatured by heat and reducing agent
treatment, with each antibody having between 2-fold to >10-fold reduced immunoreactivity after
treatment (Figure 2C). To determine significance we fit log-logistic dose-response models to
each protein and antibody combination that had at least 2 replicates​26​, with Bonferroni-corrected
p-values ranging from 0.02 (BSG and MEM-M6/1) to < 0.0001 (all others) when comparing
denatured and control curves by F-tests.

With the functionality of our constructs quality-tested, we performed a plate-based
binding assay​27 that uses the avidity gains of multimerized proteins to detect even highly
transient protein-protein interactions​28​. The SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and ACE2 gave clear
binding signals in both binding orientations as plate-bound baits and reporter-linked preys, yet
no signals were observed for either BSG isoform against either spike construct (Figure 3A). By
contrast the known interaction between BSG and ​Plasmodium falciparum RH5 was readily
detected, as was a control low-affinity interaction between human CD200 and CD200R. Notably
these interactions have similar or even weaker affinity than reported for the BSG-spike
interaction​11,29​. Finally, in response to recent reports of a mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 spike that
is rapidly displacing the reference sequence​30,31​, we also checked whether the D614G variant of
the spike could bind BSG; again, we could not detect any interaction (Figure 3B). In all
configurations the signal from BSG binding spike protein was indistinguishable from the
background of non-interacting protein pairs and significantly below the known interaction pairs
(Welch’s t-test of ACE2-spike interactions vs BSG-spike interactions p = 0.0002) (Figure 3C).

Discussion
Identifying the host receptors which a virus can recognize is an important step in
mechanistically explaining viral infection, and can offer insight in a virus’ cellular tropism and
factors influencing susceptibility. Despite the importance of determining precisely which entry
receptors SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect human cells, there remains considerable uncertainty amid
multiple claimed viral receptors with variable qualities of data behind them​9,32–35​. We investigated
one of the most prominent claims among these, that human BSG acts as an alternate receptor
for the virus to interact with, which has been the topic of several studies, news and review
articles, and a clinical trial​8,14,15,36–39​. Our access to established tools and reagents from previous
work studying BSG’s role as a host receptor in ​Plasmodium i​ nfection allowed us to rapidly
investigate BSG as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Despite validating the functionality of all our
reagents, we were unable to detect any binding in biochemical or cell-based assays for either
common BSG isoform or either configuration or allele of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
BSG is highly expressed on many cell types throughout the body, including activated
lymphocytes and red blood cells, forming the basis of the Ok blood grouping system​41​. Notably,
SARS-CoV-2 has not been found to enter red blood cells​42​. However, the possibility that BSG
could act as an accessory binding receptor for the virus has been speculated in several
publications to possibly explain in part the link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and
hematological symptoms in patients​38,39,43,44​. Our data suggest this hypothesis should be treated
cautiously. Similarly, if our negative findings are replicated, it would necessitate a
re-interpretation of the clinical trial involving injections of anti-BSG monoclonal antibodies, as
any patient benefit would be more likely explained by alternative hypotheses such as immune
modulation as opposed to direct blockage of viral invasion through BSG. Hypotheses relying on
BSG binding to explain viral tropism may also need closer reconsideration​14​.
Although our findings were negative, they nevertheless carry important potential
implications to both our understanding of the basic biology of SARS-CoV-2 and efforts to
translate knowledge of the virus’ host receptors into therapeutics. We encourage greater study
in confirming the mechanisms that have been proposed, not just for BSG but also for the
multiple other putative viral receptors, so as to resolve the uncertainty around whether
SARS-CoV-2 utilizes any receptors beyond ACE2 during infection.

Materials and Methods
Expression construct design
cDNA expression constructs were taken from a previously-assembled library of full-length
human cDNAs in human expression vectors​24​. The BSG construct was cloned from a copy
(Origene #RG203894) of the canonical 2-domain isoform of BSG (NM_198589.1), while the
ACE2 cDNA (NM_021804.2) was expressed from a similar expression vector utilizing a CMV
promoter (Geneocopia #EX-U1285-M02). The recombinant human BSG ectodomain constructs
have been previously described​11,23 and span from M1-L206 (BSG) or M1-L322 (BSG-long). The
extracellular domain truncations for the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins have also been previously
published​17​. The S1 domain was defined as spanning Q14-Y647, while the full spike ectomain
spanned Q14-K1211. The endogenous viral signal peptide was replaced with an efficient mouse
antibody signal peptide​45​. As previously described, the full spike ectodomain was mutated at its
polybasic protease cleavage site (682-685 RRAR to SGAG), had a proline stabilizing mutation
introduced (986-987 KV to PP), and to mimic the natural trimerized structure of the spike had a
foldon trimerization domain introduced at its C-terminus. The ACE2 ectodomain spanned
M1-S740, retaining its endogenous signal peptide.
Recombinant protein expression and purification
Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293E cells were transiently transfected with polyethylenimine
as previously described​46,47​. Per 100 mL of cells, 50 µg of plasmid was transfected along with 1
µg of a plasmid encoding the biotin-ligase BirA to direct biotinylation of the recombinant
proteins​48​. Cells were grown in Freestyle Media (Life Technologies #12338018) supplemented
with 100 µM D-biotin (Sigma #2031). Human proteins were incubated for 120 hours at 37°C,
while spike proteins were shifted to 34°C and supplemented with 0.5% (m/v) tryptone N1
(OrganoTechnie #19553) 24 hours post-transfection and incubated a further 96 hours based on
a published spike-specific optimized protocol​49​. After incubation, cell culture supernatants were
harvested and passed through 0.22 µm filters. Purification was done using nickel-nitrilotriacetic
acid (Ni-NTA) resins (Thermo Scientific #88221) that were pre-washed for 10 minutes in 2
washes of 25 mM imidazole (Sigma #I2399) phosphate buffer. Supernatants were mixed with
pre-washed Ni-NTA resin overnight at 4°C, then washed three times with 25 mM imidazole
phosphate buffer before eluting in 200 mM imidazole buffer. Purified proteins were analyzed on
4-12% gradient Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen #NP0329) following denaturation for 10 minutes at
80°C in NuPAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen #NP0007, #NP0004). Across experimental
replicates, independent batches of protein were used, with the exception of BSG and BSG-long
for which a single batch was quality-tested and used in all subsequent experiments.
Flow cytometry and tetramer binding assays
To generate transfected cells overexpressing cell-surface receptors, human embryonic kidney
(HEK)-293E cells were seeded one day prior to transfection at a density of 2.5x10​5 cells per mL
in Freestyle Media (Life Technologies #12338018) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated

fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cells were transiently transfected with polyethylenimine as previously
described​39,4​, except with double the ratio of DNA to cells. Then 48 hours after transfection, cells
had culture media aspirated and were resuspended in 1 μM DAPI (Biolegend #422801) and
incubated on ice for 5 minutes. Cells were then stained in u-bottom 96-well plates (Greiner
#650161) with recombinant protein tetramers conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE). Tetramers were
prepared by mixing 1 or 5 pmol of biotinylated protein monomer with 0.25 to 1.25 pmol of
streptavidin-PE (Biolegend #405245) respectively and incubating for 2 hours at room
temperature. Cells were spun down and resuspended in 100 μL of tetramer in a solution of 1%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) and phosphate buffered-saline (PBS) supplemented with calcium
and magnesium ions (Gibco #14040133). Cells and tetramers were incubated on ice for 45
minutes, washed in cold PBS, and stained for viability with DAPI (Invitrogen #D1306), and finally
resuspended in the same 1% BSA PBS solution. Antibody staining was performed with a similar
procedure, except during the first 30 minutes on ice cells were incubated with 30 μg/mL of
monoclonal Ab-1 anti-BSG antibody​12​, then resuspended in 1:500 anti-human IgG antibody
conjugated to Cy3 (Sigma #C2571). Fluorescence staining was measured by a BD Fortessa
flow cytometer.
Monoclonal antibody ELISAs
Streptavidin-coated 96-well plates (Nunc #436014) were pre-washed in 175 μL hepes-buffered
saline (HBS) with 0.1% tween-20 (HBS-T), then blocked in 2% (m/v) bovine serum albumin
(BSA, Sigma #A9647) in HBS for 1 hour at room temperature. In a separate 96-well plate, a 1:4
dilution series of biotinylated BSG or control protein was prepared in 2% BSA HBS, then 100 μL
of the protein dilution transferred to the blocked streptavidin-coated 96-well plate. In the
experiments to determine the protein’s sensitivity to heat and reduction treatment, one half of
the protein sample was denatured by heating at 80°C for 10 minutes in the presence of 5%
beta-mercaptoethanol. After capturing protein for 1 hour at room temperature, plates were
washed three times with 150 μL HSB-T. Anti-human basigin monoclonal antibodies were added
at the following concentrations: 1.7 μg/mL Ab-1 (Zenonos et al., formerly known as ch6D9)​12​,
2.2 μg/mL M
​ EM-M6/1 ​(Abcam #ab666), and 1.3 μg/mL MEM-M6/6 (Abcam #ab119114)​25​. A
control mouse anti-rat Cd4 domain 3+4 monoclonal antibody (OX68) against the tags of our
recombinant proteins was used at a 1.6 μg/mL concentration. After 1 hour of incubation with the
primary antibody and three HBS-T washes, secondary antibody was added as 1:7000 donkey
anti-human IgG (Abcam #ab102407) for ch6D9 and for all other antibodies as 1:3500 goat
anti-mouse IgG (Sigma #A9316). Both secondary antibodies were conjugated to alkaline
phosphatase. After 45 minutes of incubation with the secondary antibody, the plates were
washed again three times with HBS-T. A substrate of 60 μL 2 mg/mL
para-Nitrophenylphosphate (Sigma #P4744) in diethanolamine buffer was added to each well to
develop signal over 30 minutes. Absorbance was measured on a Tecan plate reader at 405 nm.
Avidity-based binding assays
Biotinylated recombinant proteins were tetramerized around streptavidin-HRP (Pierce #21130)
for 1 hour at room temperature to form reporter-linked preys. Per well of the assay plate, 0.1

pmol of recombinant monomer were added to 0.025 pmol of streptavidin to create a highly avid
binding reagent. Streptavidin-coated 96-well plates (Nunc #436014) were pre-washed in 175 μL
hepes-buffered saline (HBS) with 0.1% tween-20 (HBS-T), then blocked in 2% (m/v) bovine
serum albumin (BSA, Sigma #A9647) in HBS for 1 hour at room temperature. Biotinylated baits
were captured by adding 0.1 pmol of purified protein diluted in 2% BSA to each well of the plate.
After incubating the baits for 2 hours at 4°C, plates were washed three times with 150 μL
HBS-T. The pre-formed tetrameric preys were then added and the plate incubated for 1 hour at
room temperature. The plate was finally washed twice in 150 μL HBS-T and once in 150 μL
HBS before adding 60 μL 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Sigma #T0440). After
developing signal for 15 minutes at room temperature, the reaction was halted by the addition of
0.25 M HCl. Absorbance was measured on a Tecan plate reader at 405 nm.
Data processing
For flow cytometry experiments, measurement events for analysis were gated on live singlet
cells (based on DAPI and forward and side scatter profiles) using FlowJo version 9. No
compensation was done because only a single fluorochrome was used for cell staining.
Cytometry data was visualized using the CytoML package​50 in R version 3.6.1. For plate-based
experiments, raw absorbance values had background subtracted. Background for ELISAs was
defined as the minimum absorbance of any well on the measured plate, and background for
binding assays was defined as the median absorbance of each respective tetrameric prey. For
better comparing replicates, these corrected absorbances were rescaled by min-max
normalization so that the maximum absorbance on that replicate’s entire plate is defined as 1.
Statistics on binding assay data were calculated using the t.test function in the R base stats
package (version 3.6.1). Statistics on ELISA data were calculated by performing an F-test
comparing a two-parameter log-logistic dose response model fitted to the ELISA data to a null
model where both the denatured and control protein conditions were assumed to be identical.
Model fitting and statistical procedures were done using the drc package in R as previously
described​26​.
