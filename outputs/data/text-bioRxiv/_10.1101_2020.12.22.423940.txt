Abstract

12

Vaccines are essential to control the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-

13

2 (SARS-CoV-2) and to protect the vulnerable population. However, one safety concern of

14

vaccination is the possible development of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of SARS-

15

CoV-2 infection. The potential infection of Fc receptor bearing cells such as macrophages,

16

would support continued virus replication and inflammatory responses, and thereby potentially

17

worsen the clinical outcome of COVID-19. Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-

18

CoV-1 neither infect human monocyte-derived macrophages nor induce inflammatory

19

cytokines in these cells, in sharp contrast to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)

20

coronavirus and the common cold human coronavirus 229E. Furthermore, serum from

21

convalescent COVID-19 patients neither induced enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection nor

22

innate immune response in human macrophages. These results support the view that ADE may

23

not be involved in the immunopathological processes associated with COVID-19, however,

24

more studies are necessary to understand the potential contribution of antibodies-virus

25

complexes with other cells expressing FcR receptors.

1 Introduction

29

Since the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in

30

December 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the virus has spread globally causing the

31

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The high morbidity and severity of COVID-

32

19 in some of the affected patients have jeopardized the public health system of affected

33

countries. In addition, the public health measures that have been implemented to control the

34

pandemic have affected the life and economy of millions of people around the world.

35

In the current situation, there is no preexisting immunity to SARS-CoV-2, which allows the

36

virus to spread rapidly in the human population. A global vaccination campaign may have the

37

potential to finally control the pandemic and vaccination programs have started recently.

38

However, a concern is the possibility that vaccination could promote antibody-dependent

39

enhancement (ADE) of SARS-CoV-2 infection which could be associated with enhancement

40

of the disease (Lee, Wheatley, Kent, & DeKosky, 2020)

41

The undergoing mechanism of ADE of infection is based on the interaction between virion-

42

antibody complexes and Fc gamma receptors (FcùõæR) that are expressed by cells of the immune

43

system such as macrophages. The binding of virion-antibody complexes to Fc receptors could

44

result in their uptake into the cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis leading to potential

45

infection of the cells (Taylor et al., 2015). Despite speculation and alarming about this

46

possibility at the time of initiation of our work, no data were published specifically addressing

47

ADE of SARS-CoV-2 (Lee et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020). With this in mind, the present

48

study aimed to investigate whether immune sera from convalescent COVID-19 patients would

49

enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection and promote secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines

50

production by human macrophages. To this end we performed a comparative study on the

51

susceptibility of human macrophages to infection with human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E),

52

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

53

and the inflammatory cytokine response of these cells. Potential ADE of infections by SARS-

54

CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were studied using immune sera from convalescent COVID-19

55

patients. 2 Material and Methods

56

2.1 Ethics Statement

57

Buffy coats from anonymous healthy blood donors were obtained from the regional transfusion

58

blood service of the Swiss Red Cross (SRC) (Bern, Switzerland). The use of buffy coats was

59

approved by the SRC review board. All serum samples employed in this study were collected

60

following the guidance of the Act on Medical Devices (MPG guideline 98/79/EC) for the

61

collection of human residual material to evaluate suitability of an in vitro diagnostic medical

62

device (¬ß24). For this study an informed consent and ethical approval was not needed because

63

only leftovers of serum samples for diagnostic laboratory procedures were used.

64

2.2 Cells

65

Vero cells (E6 and B4 lineages, African Green monkey kidney epithelial cells) and Huh-7 cells

66

(human hepatocellular carcinoma cells) were cultured in Dulbecco‚Äôs minimal essential medium

67

(DMEM; Life Technologies), supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS), non-essential

68

amino acids (Life Technologies), penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) and HEPES (Gibco).

69

For the production of human monocyte derived macrophages (hMDM), peripheral blood

70

mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from buffy coats by density gradient centrifugation

71

on Ficoll-Paque‚Ñ¢ PLUS (1.077 g/L; GE healthcare). Then, monocytes were sorted using anti-

72

CD14 beads as proposed by the manufacturer (Miltenyi Biotech GmbH), and seeded in 24 well

73

plates at 2.5 x 105 cells/well in 500 ¬µl of Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium

74

(Gibco) and kept at 37 ¬∞C and 5% CO2 atmosphere for one hour. Non-adherent cells were

75

removed and 500 ¬µl of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% of FBS (Gibco), GlutaMAX

76

(Gibco), penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) and human M-CSF (100 ng/ml; Miltenyi Biotec) were

77

added. The cells were cultured for six days at 37 ¬∞C and 5% CO2. The full medium

78

complemented with M-CSF was replaced every 48 to 72 hours.

79

2.3 Viruses

80

A collection of different coronaviruses was employed for the experiments of the present study

81

including the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-299E; (Thiel, Herold, Schelle, & Siddell,

82

2001)), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, strain EMC/2012; (van

83

Boheemen et al., 2012)), SARS-CoV (Frankfurt-1; (Thiel et al., 2003)) and SARS-CoV-2

84

(SARS-CoV-2/M√ºnchen-1.1/2020/929) kindly provided by Daniela Niemeyer, Marcel M√ºller,

85

and Christian Drosten (Charit√©, Berlin, Germany). HCoV-299E was propagated in Huh-7 cells

86

in DMEM supplemented with 5% of FBS and non-essential amino acids at 33¬∞C. MERS-CoV

87

was propagated in Vero B4 cells in MEM supplemented with 2% of FBS and non-essential

88

amino acids at 37¬∞C. For the propagation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Vero E6 cells in

89

MEM supplemented with 2% of FBS and non-essential amino acids at 37¬∞C was employed. All

90

viral titrations were performed taking advantage of the virus-induced cytopathic effects that

91

were apparent 56 to 72 hours post infection. Virus titers were expressed as 50% tissue culture

92

infective dose per ml (TCID50/ml).

93

2.4 Infection of hMDM

94

Human MDM were incubated for 1.5 h at 39¬∞C or 37¬∞C with the respective virus using a

95

multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 TCID50 per cell, including mock control. Subsequently, the

96

virus inoculum was removed, the cells washed three times with warm phosphate buffered saline

97

(PBS), and RPMI medium supplemented with 2% FBS was added to the cells. As a positive

98

control for the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines either 1 ¬µg/ml of lipopolysaccharide

99

(LPS; Sigma-Aldrich) or 10 Œºg/ml of polyinosinic-polycytidytic acid (poly I:C, Sigma-Aldrich)

100

were added to the cell culture medium. After 24 h, supernatants were collected and stored at -

101

70¬∞C. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature,washed with

102

PBS, and permeabilised with 0.3% saponin (PanReac AppliChem). The permeabilisation was

103

performed for 20 min on ice in the presence of J2 monoclonal antibody direceted to dsRNA

104

(English and Scientific Consulting). Subsequently, the cells were washed with 0.1% saponin,

105

and cells were incubated for 20 min on ice with Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated anti-mouse IgG2a

106

(ThermoFisher Scientific) in 0.3% saponin. Cells were washed once with PBS prior incubation

107

for 5 min at 37 ¬∞C with 4‚Ä≤,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma). Finally, the percentage

108

of infected hMDM was determined by by enumeratingof dsRNA positive cells in 10 fields/well

109

using an Axio Observer Z1 inverted microscope equipped with a Zeiss Colibri Illuminator

110

(CarlZeiss) and digital imaging Zeiss software (AxioVision, v4). All generated images were

111

analyzed using ImageJ software.

112

2.5 Antibody-Dependent Enhancement of Infection

113

A collection of sera from COVID-19 convalescent patients from a previously published work

114

was employed for the present study (Zettl et al., 2020). This included sera with a broad range

115

of neutralization titers against SARS-CoV-2 (ND50 <1:10; 1:20; 1:160; 1:240 and 1:2560). In

116

order to test the ADE potential of these sera, different serum dilutions (1:10; 1:100; 1:1000 and

117

1:10000) were incubated for 30 min at 37 ¬∞C with an equal volume of viral suspension (SARS-

118

CoV or SARS-CoV-2) corresponding to a MOI of 1 TCID50/cell. Thereafter, the virus/serum

119

mixtures were added to human macrophages or Vero E6 cells and incubated for 30 min at 37

120

¬∞C and 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells were washed three times with PBS before fresh medium

121

was added. Following an incubation period of 24 h, macrophages and Vero E6 cells were

122

analyzed by flow cytometry for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein

123

expression. The cells were harvested using TrypLETMSelect (Gibco) for 20 min at room

124

temperature and fixed with 4% (w/v) formaldehyde. Thereafter the cells were washed and

125

permeabilized/stained for 20 min on ice with 0.3% (w/v) saponin in PBS in the presence of a

126

rabbit antibody directed to the SARS-CoV N protein (Rockland-inc). The cells were

127

subsequently washed, incubated for 10 min with anti-rabbit Alexa 488 fluochrome conjugate

128

(ThermoFisher Scientific), and analysed by flow cytometry using a FACSCantoII (Becton

129

Dickinson). For analysis, Flowjo V.9.1 software (Treestars, Inc.) was used. Dead cells were

130

excluded by electronic gating in forward/side scatter plots, followed by exclusion of doublets.

131

2.6 Cytokines Measurement

132

Cytokines in the supernatants in this study including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interferon

133

beta (IFN-Œ≤), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-1Œ≤ were quantified by ELISA (R&D Systems)

134

following the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. Detection limits were 30 pg/ml for TNF, 10 pg/ml

135

for IFN-Œ≤, 4 pg/ml for IL-1Œ≤ and 9 pg/ml for IL-6.

136

2.7 Statistics

137

For the generation of figures and data analyses the GraphPad Prism 8 Software (GraphPad

138

Software, Inc.) was employed. All experiments were independently performed 3 to 6 times with

139

cells from different donors, and each experiment was run in triplicates. For viral titrations,

140

differences between groups were assessed using a Kruskal‚ÄìWallis test, and for individual

141

differences the Mann‚ÄìWhitney U-test with Bonferroni correction as post hoc was employed.

142

For group differences in the percentages of infected cells and levels of cytokines expression

143

comparisons, a one-way ANOVA test with Bonferroni correction as post hoc was performed.

144

Correlation analysis between infected cells, viral titers, and expressed cytokines were calculated

145

by Spearman's Rho analysis; a correlation between two different factors was considered

146

relevant with R2 > 0.5. A p value lower than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for

147

every analyzed data. In figure 1, different superscript letters indicate a significant difference (p

148

< 0.05) between the conditions. For the table 2 * indicates p < 0.05, **p ‚â§ 0.002, ***p ‚â§ 0.001

149

and ****p ‚â§ 0.0001.

152

Infection of hMDM with HCoV-299E, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 at MOI of

153

1 TCID50/cell demonstrated high susceptibility to infection with the common cold virus HCoV-

154

229E, low susceptibility to infection with the highly pathogenic coronavirus MERS-CoV, and

155

resistance to infection by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, all assessed by immunofluorescence

156

analysis using an anti-dsRNA marker (Figure 1A and B). When we quantified the number of

157

infectious virus particles in the cell culture supernatants we observed that only HCoV-229E and

158

MERS-CoV replicated efficiently in hMDM (Figure 1C). Although HCoV-229E showed higher

159

percentages of infected hMDM (32.79% ¬±18.79 SD) the highest virus titers were found in the

160

cell culture supernatant of macrophages infected with MERS-CoV (Figure 1C). Nevertheless,

161

it has to be taken into consideration that all experiments were performed at 37¬∞C although the

162

optimal temperature for HCoV-229E is 33¬∞C (Dijkman et al., 2013). Viral titers of SARS-CoV

163

and SARS-CoV-2 were not statistically significant compared to the mock control. In

164

conclusion, these results indicate that neither SARS-CoV nor SARS-CoV-2 are able to infect

165

hMDM.

166

3.2 Human MDM only produce cytokines after HCoV-229E infection

167

Human MDM infected by HCoV-229E, but not MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2,

168

secreted TNF, IFN-Œ≤ and low levels of IL-6 (Figure 1D-F). None of the tested coronaviruses

169

induced secretion of IL-1Œ≤. Taking into consideration that viral RNA might induce innate

170

immune responses, we tested the correlation between the percentage of dsRNA positive cells,

171

viral titers and level of secreted cytokines. The results found a clear association between the

172

percentage of infected cells and the secreted cytokines but not with the viral titers (Table 1).

173

3.3 Antibodies from convalescent COVID-19 patients neither induce antibody-dependent

174

enhancement of infection of hMDM with SARS-COV-2 nor promote cytokine responses.

175

In order to control the experimental conditions for testing ADE, selected COVID-19 sera with

176

a neutralization titer below 1:10 and with a neutralization titer of 1:240, were diluted serially

177

from 1:10 to 1:1000, mixed with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and then added to Vero E6

178

cells. Both sera demonstrated a dilution-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In

179

addition, a cross-reactivity of COVID-19 convalescent patient sera with SARS-CoV-1 was

180

observed, confirming previous reports (Zettl et al., 2020) (Table 2).

181

Using the same approach, a larger collection of sera from COVID-19 convalescent patients with

182

neutralization titers ranging from <10 to 1:2560 was incubated at different concentrations with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.22.423940; this version posted December 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this

183

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and added to hMDM. Importantly, with none of the tested serum

184

dilutions which went up to1:10‚Äô000 infection of hMDM was observed. Moreover, hMDM

185

exposed to virus-antibodies complexes did not secrete any detectable pro-inflammatory

186

cytokines (Table 2). These results indicate that the potential uptake of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-

187

CoV-2 via FcR does not result in infection and activation of human macrophages.

188

4 Discussion

189

A first observation of the present study was that in contrast to the common cold virus hCoV-

190

229E and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were unable to infect hMDM. The

191

receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) typically expressed on

192

ciliated epithelial cells, goblet cells, type II alveolar pneumocytes as well as other cells from

193

different organs as enterocytes (Sungnak et al., 2020). However, there are conflicting reports

194

on the infection of human macrophages by SARS-CoV. While one study described very limited

195

ACE2 expression by macrophages (Sungnak et al., 2020), another report postulated that the

196

receptor is expressed on tissue resident macrophages (Song et al., 2020). In COVID-19 patients,

197

the viral nucleoprotein N has been detected in macrophages from lymphoid organs of COVID-

198

19 patients (Park, 2020), but it is not clear whether this was caused by direct infection or as a

199

consequence of phagocytosis of infected cells.

200

The infection of hMDM by HCoV-229E is in line with the expression by these cells of

201

aminopeptidase N (CD13), the cellular receptor for HCoV-229E (Yeager et al., 1992). It is also

202

in agreement with previous reports describing the infection of alveolar macrophages by HCoV-

203

229E (Funk et al., 2012). The cellular receptor for MERS-CoV dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP4

204

also known as CD26) is expressed at low levels by human monocytes and macrophages of

205

healthy donors (Rao et al., 2018; Rao et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2013; Zhong et al., 2013), which

206

could explain MERS-CoV infection of hMDM in our experiments.

207

Our results are also in line with a previous report demonstrating that following infection with

208

HCoV-229E human macrophages strongly secrete TNF, but also produce IL-6 and some IFN-

209

Œ≤ (Funk et al., 2012). Finally, we also noticed a poor innate immune response of macrophages

210

following infection with MERS-CoV, confirming a previous report (Zhou et al., 2014).

211

While writing the present manuscript contradictory data were published claiming that SARS-

212

CoV-2 induces an immune activation of hMDM (Zheng et al., 2020). These conflicting results

213

might be the consequence of different methodologies used. While we employed purified

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.22.423940; this version posted December 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this

214

monocytes to generate macrophages in six days, Zheng and collaborators kept PBMC with M-

215

CSF for four days and then for another 10 days when the cells became adherent (Zheng et al.,

216

2020). Another important methodological difference is that our study used ELISA to detect

217

cytokines while Zheng and collaborators analyzed mRNA by RT-PCR. As the levels of mRNA

218

induction found were rather low (fold change increase below 0.3), it is possible that protein

219

detection by ELISA would have been below the detection limit as well. We are therefore

220

proposing that hMDM generated from pure monocytes are not permissive to SARS-CoV-2

221

infection and do not mount inflammatory responses. This is in contrast to HCoV-229E and the

222

TLR ligand controls. While future studies expanding to tissue macrophages are important, our

223

results indicate that proinflammatory responses observed during COVID-19 may not be the

224

result of macrophage infection but rather originate from other innate immune cells or a complex

225

interaction between different immune cells which could include macrophages. Therefore, to

226

understand these events more immune cells such as plasmacytoid dendritic cells that are at the

227

frontline of the antiviral cytokine responses should be investigated.

228

In view of a potential link between ADE and inflammation during COVID-19 in the presence

229

of antibodies, we tested this hypothesis using hMDM. With the selected sera from convalescent

230

COVID-19 patients and the described conditions, even at very high serum dilutions and with

231

sera that had low levels of neutralizing antibodies, we did not find evidence for antibody

232

mediated enhancement of macrophage infection or pro-inflammatory cytokine responses.

233

Interestingly, sera of COVID-19 convalescent patients showed cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV

234

(Zettl et al., 2020) but did not enhance infection by this virus of macrophages SARS-CoV,

235

although having cross-reactivity. This is in line with a previous report showing that the presence

236

of cross-reacting antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, originating from previous endemic

237

coronavirus infections, were not linked with more severe COVID-19 (Ng et al., 2020).

238

Furthermore, in vaccination/challenge experiments carried out in macaques no signs of

239

enhanced disease were detected (Gao et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020). Finally, COVID-19 patients

240

treated with plasma transfusion from convalescent patients did not show signs of disease

241

aggravation (Casadevall & Pirofski, 2020; Joyner et al., 2020). Altogether, these data are in line

242

with our findings, demonstrating that hMDM are not infected or activated by SARS-CoV-2

243

neither by direct contact nor mediated by antibodies from convalescent COVID-19 patients.

244

Although the lack of hMDM infection by SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 provides evidence of

245

a lack of ADE, our study cannot exclude ADE effects on other FcR-expressing cells as well as

246

a possible role of the complement system or T-cell mediated inflammation.

cells washed, and fresh medium added. At 24 hours post infection, dsRNA in the cells was

258

detected with a specific antibody and nuclei were stained with DAPI (A). The percentage of

259

dsRNA-positive hMDM was calculated for 10 fields per condition (B). Virus titers (C), TNF-

260

ÔÅ° (D), IFN-Œ≤ (E) and IL-6 (F) were determined in the cell culture supernatants. The data from

261

three independent experiments run in triplicates are shown. Different superscript letters indicate

262

a significant difference (p < 0.05) between the conditions.
