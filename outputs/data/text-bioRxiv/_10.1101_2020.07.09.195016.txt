Abstract

Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), caused by a genetic mutant of feline enteric coronavirus

29

known as FIPV, is a highly fatal disease of cats with no currently available vaccine or FDA-

30

approved cure. Dissemination of FIPV in affected cats results in a range of clinical signs

31

including cavitary effusions, anorexia, fever and lesions of pyogranulomatous vasculitis and

32

peri-vasculitis with or without central nervous system and/or ocular involvement. There is a

33

critical need for effective and approved antiviral therapies against coronaviruses including FIPV

34

and zoonotic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19. With regards to SARS-

35

CoV-2, preliminary evidence suggests that there may be potential clinical and pathological

36

overlap with feline coronaviral disease including enteric and neurological involvement in some

cases. We have screened 89 putative antiviral compounds and have identified 25 compounds

38

with antiviral activity against FIPV, representing a variety of drug classes and mechanisms of

39

antiviral action. Based upon successful combination treatment strategies for human patients

40

with HIV or hepatitis C virus infections, we have identified combinations of drugs targeting

41

different steps of the FIPV life cycle resulting in synergistic antiviral effect. Translationally, we

42

suggest that a combined anticoronaviral therapy (cACT) with multiple mechanisms of action

43

and penetration of all potential anatomic sites of viral infection should be applied towards

44

other challenging to treat coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV-2.

Author summary

47

We have screened 89 compounds in vitro for antiviral activity against FIPV. The putative

48

antiviral activity of these compounds was either purported to be a direct effect on viral proteins

49

involved in viral replication or an indirect inhibitory effect on normal cellular pathways usurped

50

by FIPV to aid viral replication. Twenty-five of these compounds were found to have significant

51

antiviral activity. Certain combinations of these compounds were determined to be superior to

52

monotherapy alone.

Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) is a highly fatal disease of cats with no effective vaccine or

61

FDA-approved treatment. Although the pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated, FIP is

62

generally understood to develop as the result of specific mutations in the viral genome of the

63

minimally pathogenic and ubiquitous feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), creating the virulent FIP

64

virus (FIPV)[1–3]. These FECV mutations result in a virus-host cell tropism switch from intestinal

65

enterocytes to peritoneal-type macrophages. Productive macrophage infection by FIPV,

66

targeted widespread anatomic dissemination, and immune-mediated perivasculitis results in

67

the highly fatal systemic inflammatory disease, FIP[4]. As a result of viral dissemination, FIP may

68

present with clinical signs reflecting inflammation in a variety of anatomic sites potentially

69

including the abdominal cavity and viscera, thoracic cavity, central nervous system and/or

70

eye[5–8]. FIP remains a devastating viral disease of cats due to its high mortality rate,

71

challenges in establishing a precise etiologic diagnosis, and the current lack of available and

72

effective treatment options[7, 9]. The development of an effective vaccine for FIP has been

73

complicated by the role of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in FIP disease

74

pathogenesis, where the presence of non-neutralizing anti-coronaviral antibodies have been

75

shown to exacerbate FIP disease[10–12].

76
77

Mammalian coronaviruses infect and generally cause disease in either the intestinal tract

78

or respiratory system of their infected vertebrate hosts[13]. However, FIP often manifests as a

79

multisystemic inflammatory disease syndrome as a result of the widespread dissemination of

80

FIPV-infected macrophages. The recent pandemic emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in

81

variable disease syndromes in infected human patients, collectively referred to as COVID-19.

82

Although SARS CoV-2 has an apparent tropism for respiratory epithelium resulting in interstitial

83

pneumonia, recent evidence indicates that COVID-19 can also present as alimentary disease,

84

manifesting clinically as diarrhea[14, 15]. Tropism for these tissues reflects membrane

85

expression of the ACE2 protein, the cellular target of SARS-CoV-2[16]. SARS-CoV-2 further

86

appears to be capable of infecting and causing inflammatory disease in tissues external to

87

intestinal tract and respiratory systems, including the brain, eye, reproductive tract, and cardiac

88

myocardium[17–21]. Brainstem neuroinvasion and subsequent encephalitis by SARS CoV-2 may

89

contribute to respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients[20, 22]. Experimentally, SARS CoV-2 is

90

also able to establish a productive infection in cats[23]. Therefore, FIPV infection of cats and

91

SARS CoV-2 infection of human patients bear more resemblance than may have been initially

92

perceived.

93
94

There is an immediate and critical need for available and effective antiviral therapies to treat

95

these coronaviral diseases. FIPV-infected cats could serve as a translational model and provide

96

useful guidance for SARS CoV-2 patients with COVID-19. Recent antiviral clinical trials in both

97

experimentally and naturally FIPV-infected cats have shown promise in treating and curing FIP

98

through the use of GS-441524, a nucleoside analog and metabolite of the prodrug Remdesivir

99

(Gilead Sciences), or GC-376, a 3C-like protease inhibitor of FIPV (Anavive)[24–26]. The GS-

100

441524 prodrug Remdesivir has recently shown promise in treating human patients infected

101

with SARS CoV-2[27, 28]. Despite these recent clinical successes, these antiviral compounds

102

have yet to be approved and are currently unavailable for clinical veterinary use in cats with

103

FIP.

104
105

The identification and development of effective antiviral therapies can be both costly and time

106

consuming. The targeted screening and repurposing of drugs previously FDA-approved or

107

approved for research use can play an efficient role in drug discovery. Using a slate of putative

108

antiviral compounds selected based on their proven efficacy in treating other RNA-viruses, we

109

identified a subset of compounds with strong anti-FIPV activity and characterized their safety

110

and efficacy profiles in vitro. Based upon the great success of combined anti-retroviral therapy

111

(cART) against HIV-1 and combination therapies against hepatitis C virus[29], we have

112

developed methods to identify effective combinational therapies against FIPV. Initial

113

monotherapies against HIV-1, such as azidothymidine (AZT), often resulted in viral escape

114

mutations. The use of multiple antiviral compounds concurrently appears to block this adaptive

115

viral evolutionary mechanism as HIV-1 evolution is effectively halted by modern day cART[30].

116

The success of cART is thought to be the result of pharmacologically targeting the virus lifecycle

117

at multiple stages simultaneously, collectively achieving a synergistic antiviral effect[31].

118
119

Given the impressive success of cART, it would seem feasible that concurrently targeting FIPV

120

at different steps of the virus lifecycle with a combined anti-coronaviral therapy (cACT) may

121

offer a greater level of sustained and more complete success than has been achieved with

122

monotherapies alone. The inclusion of an antiviral agent in cACT capable of penetrating the

123

blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and eye and achieving pharmacologically relevant tissue

124

concentrations may facilitate system-wide FIPV eradication. Here we describe a set of in vitro

125

assays facilitating the rapid screening and identification of effective anti-coronaviral

126

compounds. Efficacious antiviral agents with different mechanisms of action and predicted

127

body distribution were combined into cACT and tested for compound synergy. We

128

hypothesized that the combinatorial use of two or more effective antiviral monotherapies with

129

differing mechanisms of action will facilitate the identification of synergistic combinations

130

providing superior anti-coronaviral efficacy compared to their use as sole agents. The

131

identification of successful cACT may also provide guidance towards the treatment of other

132

emerging viral diseases, such as SARS-CoV-2.

135

Compound Screening

136

In order to identify compounds with anti-FIPV activity, a compilation of 89 compounds

137

(Supplementary Table 1) from differing drug classes and with a variety of putative mechanisms

138

of action were screened for anti-coronaviral activity in in vitro assays. Compounds screened

139

included nucleoside polymerase inhibitors (NPIs), non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors

140

(NNPIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), NS5A inhibitors, a set of novel anti-helicase chemical

141

“fragments”, and a set of compounds with undetermined mechanisms of action. From this

142

group of 89 compounds, a total of 25 different compounds were determined to possess

143

antiviral activity against FIPV including NPIs, PIs, NS5A inhibitors and two compounds with

144

undetermined mechanisms of action (termed “other”, Fig 1). These successful antiviral

145

compounds included toremifene citrate, daclatasvir, elbasvir, lopinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir

146

mesylate, K777/K11777, grazoprevir, amodiaquine, EIDD 1931, EIDD 2801, and GS-441524

nucleoside analog compounds provided by Gilead Sciences structurally related to the

nucleoside analogs GS-441524 and Remdesivir for their antiviral properties and found several

150

with potential (included in the above reported 25 identified compounds) but did not pursue

151

these agents further. As a result, the total number of antiviral agents carried forward for

152

further analyses was 13. This total includes the previously identified 3-C protease inhibitor, GC-

Determining antiviral efficacy

The antiviral efficacy (EC50) was determined for 10 antiviral compounds. For these compounds,

176

the EC50 ranged from 0.04 M to 13.47 M (Table 1, Fig. 3). One of the antiviral agents,

testing. GS-441524 sourced from China (MedChemExpress, HY-103586) was shown to have a

Cytotoxicity Safety Profiles

189

Cytotoxicity Safety Profiles (CSP) were determined for ten different antiviral compounds in

CRFK cells. At 5 M, seven of the tested compounds demonstrated essentially no cytotoxicity

191

while two of the antivirals, amodiaquine and toremifene had 11 and 12% cytotoxicity,

192

respectively (Fig. 4; Table 2). The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) for GC376 has been

193

reported previously as > 150 M [32]. Interestingly, based on the Promega CellToxTM Green

194

Cytotoxicity Assay, the cytotoxicity of both EIDD compounds was essentially undetectable up to

195

100 M. However, visual inspection of the EIDD treated wells just prior to fluorescent dye

196

application and plate readings revealed differences in cell morphology (cytopathic effect)

197

between untreated CRFK cells and treated cells. The untreated CRFK cells were characterized by

198

adherent spindled morphology in a single monolayer, while the EIDD-treated wells

demonstrated a clear decrease in confluency by comparison with variable cell morphology

including rounding up of cells (cytopathic effect). The inconsistency between subjective visual

201

assessment of EIDD-treated wells and the fluorescence assay is enigmatic. It is possible that the

overall decreased cell number in EIDD-treated wells resulted in loss and degradation of nucleic

Quantification of compound inhibition of viral RNA production with monotherapy

214

A real-time RT PCR assay was utilized to measure each antiviral compounds’ ability to inhibit

215

coronaviral replication as monotherapy (viral RNA knock-down assay). Compounds

216

demonstrating the greatest inhibition of FIPV RNA production were GC376, a 3C-like

217

coronavirus protease inhibitor, GS-441524, EIDD-1931 and EIDD-2801, the latter three all being

218

nucleoside analogs (Fig. 5, Table 3). Those with the least inhibitory effect on viral RNA

219

production include elbasvir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir. Ritonavir, a protease inhibitor, is used in

220

combination with lopinavir to treat HIV-1 infection (Kaletra, AbbVie). Lopinavir monotherapy

221

has poor oral bioavailability in people, however, when used in combination, Ritonavir has been

222

demonstrated to markedly improve lopinavir’s plasma concentration[33]. Therefore, despite

223

the relatively minimal FIPV inhibition identified with ritonavir as monotherapy, this compound

224

was carried forward for additional testing, including combined anticoronaviral assessment.

Quantification of compound inhibition of viral RNA production with cACT

248

In order to identify drug combinations with synergistic antiviral activity over monotherapy,

249

combinations of two or more drug compounds were selected based upon (i) established

250

combinations utilized for other viral infections like HIV-1 and HCV, (ii) drugs with different

251

mechanisms of action, (iii) potential variations in systemic distribution of the compound (e.g.

252

chemical class-based ability to penetrate the blood-brain or blood-ocular barriers), and (iv)

253

minimal cytotoxicity (based on the CSP). For each cACT, any resulting decrease in FIPV copy

254

number over the calculated additive effect for each drug used as monotherapy was considered

255

to be synergistic (Table 4). The combination of antiviral agents with the greatest total fold

256

reduction in viral RNA as well as greatest synergistic effect was determined to be GC376 and

257

amodiaquine with a 76-fold decrease in viral RNA over the additive effect (Fig 6). This particular

258

synergistic combination was one of the more interesting results given that amodiaquine alone

259

demonstrated limited inhibition of FIPV viral RNA copies determined by qRT-PCR.

Due to pronounced anti-FIPV activity of GC-376 as well as its potential availability for moving

262

forward into in vivo pharmacokinetic studies, clinical trials, and hopeful use in an established

263

cACT application, this compound was focused on in a series of mono- and combined therapy

264

“viral RNA knock-down” assays (Fig 7). Overall, GC376 demonstrated superior anti-FIPV activity

265

at 20 M both as monotherapy and in combinatorial therapies in vitro. The most marked

266

reduction in FIPV RNA occurred with combinations of GC376 at 20 M, in particular with

267

amodiaquine at 10 M. The experiment combining GC376 with amodiaquine was repeated and

Discussion

294

As there is no currently effective vaccine for FIP, there is a strong clinical and world-wide need

295

for effective antiviral treatment options for FIPV-infected cats. Here we describe the screening

296

of 89 compounds, resulting in the identification of 25 antiviral agents with antiviral efficacy and

297

strong safety profiles against the feline coronavirus, FIPV. We also identified combinations of

298

antiviral agents (cACT) that resulted in superior efficacy, or synergism, over monotherapy alone.

299

Particularly interesting was a finding relating to the use of elbasvir, which repeatedly

300

demonstrated excellent CRFK protection from FIPV-induced CPE at less than 1 M based on

301

multiple plaquing assays (EC50 of 0.16 M). However, essentially no difference was detected in

302

the viral RNA copy number between infected cells treated with or without elbasvir. Further

303

visual analysis of FIPV infected CRFK cells that were treated with elbasvir revealed an atypical

304

cell morphology relative to the uninfected cells characterized by variable swelling, rounding of

305

cells and scattered partial cell detachment (cytopathic effect). These “atypical cells” sparsely

306

detached from the culture plate and as a result, the absorbance values acquired in the plaquing

307

assay were comparable to uninfected control wells. This dichotomous result between the

16

308

plaque assay and viral RNA knock-down assay suggests that the antiviral effect of elbasvir may

309

be downstream of viral replication, and as a result, elbasvir may not protect cells from the

310

accumulation of viral RNA. Elbasvir has been utilized for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV)

311

infected patients and is thought to target the HCV NS5A protein preventing replication and also

312

virion assembly[34]. Although an NS5A homolog is not identified for FIPV, it is possible that

313

elbasvir exerts a similar antiviral effect by preventing FIPV virion assembly without blocking viral

314

RNA synthesis in CRFK cells. Additional assessment of FIPV-infected and treated CRFK cells

315

using transmission electron microscopy may provide clarity of elbasvir’s effect on CRFK

316

protection from FIPV-associated cellular injury and death.

317
318

The coadministration of ritonavir with lopinavir has been shown to markedly enhance the

319

plasma concentration of lopinavir in rats, dogs, and humans[33]. Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor

320

of CYP3A, which is the primary enzyme responsible for the metabolism of protease inhibitors,

321

hence, its coadministration with other protease inhibitors results in enhanced systemic

322

concentrations of the co-administered protease inhibitor, such as lopinavir[38, 39]. Ritonavir-

323

associated augmentation of the antiviral effect of lopinavir was relatively minimal in the viral

324

RNA knock-down assays with only a 10-fold FIPV inhibition over additive effect. This may be the

325

result of an in vitro artifact of testing in a feline renal cell line (i.e. CRFK cells) lacking the CYP3

326

enzyme, an enzyme typically seen in sites of high protease inhibitor first-pass metabolism (i.e.,

327

enterocytes and hepatocytes)[39]. These results suggest that in vitro assays alone may not fully

328

predict the effect of antiviral agents in FIPV infected cats in vivo.

330

Grazoprevir, an NS3/4 serine protease inhibitor, has been used in combination with elbasvir, an

331

NS5A inhibitor, to treat patients infected with HCV (Zepatier, Merck)[40]. Here we have

332

demonstrated that grazoprevir possesses anti-FIPV activity when used as monotherapy. The

333

cysteine protease inhibitor K777/K11777 has been investigated for its ability to block

334

coronavirus entry (MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1) and ebolavirus and was found to fully inhibit

335

coronavirus infection but only in target cell lines lacking virus-activating serine proteases[41].

336

For other cell lines, K777 inhibited coronavirus cell entry when combined with a serine protease

337

inhibitor[41]. It is possible that K777’s limited inhibition of FIPV RNA production could be

338

augmented if combined with a serine protease inhibitor.

339
340

Amodiaquine is an antimalarial drug and member of the 4-aminoquinoline drug class.

341

Amodiaquine, along with related 4-aminoquinolines such as chloroquine and

342

hydroxychloroquine, was originally developed for the treatment of malaria[42], and like

343

chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, possesses widespread anatomical volume of distribution,

344

including eyes and brain[43–49]. Antiviral compound penetrance into the CNS and/or ocular

345

compartments is particularly relevant in the case of FIPV-infected cats with neurologic and/or

346

ocular involvement. While several investigations have defined the antiviral properties of

347

chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine[28, 50, 51], the antiviral activity of amodiaquine has also

348

been investigated with the identification of antiviral activity against dengue virus, Ebola virus,

349

and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus[52–55]. The mechanism of

350

action of amodiaquine may involve an increase of cytoplasmic lysosomal and/or endosomal pH,

351

preventing the release of viable virions into the cytoplasm[56]. Given its unique drug class

18

352

status and purported ability to cross the blood-brain-barrier[57] amodiaquine holds promise as

353

a component of combinatorial therapy for the treatment of neurologic and/or ocular FIP.

354
355

Toremifene citrate, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), has been used for the

356

treatment of metastatic breast cancer in human patients. More recently, toremifene has been

357

evaluated for its antiviral properties and has demonstrated anticoronaviral activity against the

358

zoonotic coronaviruses Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and

359

SARS-CoV-1[58]. Toremifene has also demonstrated activity against the Ebola virus (EBOV)[59,

360

60]. While the exact mechanism of antiviral action has not been defined, toremifene’s antiviral

361

action against EBOV appears to be due to destabilization of the EBOV glycoprotein[59].

362
363

Interestingly, GC376 demonstrated perplexing differences between dosing at 10 M versus 20

364

M in combination therapy. When used in combination at 10 M with other compounds, there

365

was absent synergism and in some cases a decrease in antiviral effect with fold over additive

366

values ranging from 0.03 to 1.6 (Table 4). When used at 20 M there were still instances where

367

combining with another compound resulted in a decreased antiviral effect compared to GC376

368

used as monotherapy at 20 M. However, there was much more variation with combinations at

369

20 M with fold over additive values ranging from 0.13 to 76 (Table 4). One particular example

370

is the contrast between GC376 at 20 M compared with GC376 at 10 M combined with

371

amodiaquine at 10 M. The former resulted in the greatest viral RNA inhibition as well as the

372

greatest fold over additive (synergistic) effect, while the latter nearly lost synergism with a fold

373

over additive value of 1.6.

374
375

The identification of effective antiviral strategies for treating FIPV-infected cats holds

376

translational implications for the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. FIPV-infection in cats is

377

reminiscent of coronavirus infection in ferrets [61, 62] and has been compared to the

378

pathogenesis of other chronic, macrophage-dependent diseases such as tuberculosis[63]. As

379

the clinical and pathogenic details of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people continues to emerge,

380

there appears to be some overlap with FIPV in anatomic distribution, clinical manifestation, and

381

likely, response to certain antiviral therapies. In cats, the feline enteric coronavirus biotype

382

(FECV) is restricted to the alimentary tract as a result of an enterocyte tropism. Clinical signs in

383

cats infected with FECV range from mild gastrointestinal disease (diarrhea) to absent. The

384

mutated feline coronavirus biotype FIPV acquires a macrophage tropism and preferentially

385

targets serosal surfaces of the abdominal and thoracic cavities with a subset of cats

386

demonstrating CNS or ocular involvement[7]. Similarly, for COVID-19 patients there are reports

387

of diarrhea and a subset of patients with CNS-involvement[14]. Although the cellular receptor

388

for SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as ACE2[64], the cellular receptor for serotype I FIPV has yet

389

to be determined. The cellular receptor for the less clinically relevant FIPV serotype II has been

390

identified as feline aminopeptidase peptidase (fAPN)[4]. A study utilizing RNAseq to evaluate

391

gene expression profiles of ascites cells obtained from cats with FIP did not identify expression

392

of ACE2, suggesting that ACE2 is unlikely to be the serotype I FIPV receptor[63]. More

393

investigation into the identity of the serotype I FIPV receptor is warranted.

395

Past clinical successes using GS-441524 or GC-376 in cats with experimental and naturally

396

occurring FIP demonstrate that an effective cure for FIP is possible, however, challenges in

397

treating non-effusive (granulomatous), neurological and ocular FIP remain. The 3C-like protease

398

inhibitor, GC-376, appears to be relatively effective in the treatment of effusive FIPV infection

399

confined to body cavities but may be less effective in treating the neurological or ocular forms

400

of the disease[24]. These differing outcomes may be the result of inefficient penetration of the

401

blood-brain and blood-eye barriers, making GC-376 a promising candidate for combined

402

therapy with a CNS-penetrating antiviral drug.

FIPV inoculum for in vitro experiments

407

Crandell-Reese feline kidney cells (CRFK, ATCC) were cultured in T150 flasks (Corning),

408

inoculated with serotype II FIPV (WSU-79-1146, GenBank DQ010921) and propagated in 50 mL

409

of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) with 4.5g/L glucose (Corning) and 10% fetal

410

bovine serum (Gemini Biotec). After 72 hours of incubation at 37˚C, extensive cytopathic effect

411

(CPE) and large areas of cell clearing/detachment were noted. Flasks were then flash frozen at -

412

70˚C for 8 minutes, thawed briefly at room temperature and the cells and supernatant were

413

then centrifuged at 1500g for 5 minutes followed by a second centrifugation step at 4000g for 5

414

minutes in order to isolate cell-free viral stocks. Supernatant containing the viral stock was

415

divided into 0.5- and 1.0-ml aliquots in 1.5 ml cryotubes (Nalgene) and archived at -70˚C. After

freezing, a single tube was thawed, and the viral titer established using both bioassay (TCID50)

417

and real-time RT PCR methods (below).

418
419

The tissue culture infectious dose-50 (TCID50) was determined using a viral plaquing assay.

420

CRFK cells were grown in a 96-well tissue culture plate (Genesee Scientific) until the CRFK cells

421

achieved approximately 75-85% confluency. Serial 10-fold dilutions were made of FIPV stock

422

and 200 L samples of each dilution were added to 10-well replicates. At 72 hours post-

423

infection, the cells were fixed with methanol and stained with crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich).

424

Individual wells were evaluated visually for virus-induced CPE, scored as CPE positive or

425

negative, and the TCID50 was determined based upon the equation log10TCID50 = [total # wells

426

CPE positive/# replicates] + 0.5 to reflect infectious virions per milliliter of supernatant[68].

427
428

Quantification of FIPV by qRT-PCR

429

Cell-free viral RNA was isolated from the viral stock using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit

430

(Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The isolated RNA was DNase treated

431

(Turbo DNase, Invitrogen) and subsequently reverse transcribed using the High-Capacity RNA-

432

to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturers’ protocols. The copy number of

433

FIPV and feline GAPDH cDNA were determined using Applied Biosystems’ QuantStudio 3 Real-

434

Time PCR System and PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix, following the manufacturer’s protocol

435

for a 10 L reaction. Each PCR reaction was performed in triplicate with water template as a

436

negative control and plasmid DNA as a positive control. A control reaction excluding reverse

437

transcriptase was included in each real-time PCR assay set. cDNA templates were amplified

using the FIPV forward primer, 5’-GGAAGTTTAGATTTGATTTGGCAATGCTAG, and the FIP reverse

439

primer, 5’-AACAATCACTAGATCCAGACGTTAGCT (terminal portion of the FIPV 7b gene)[25].

440

Real-time PCR for the feline GAPDH housekeeping gene was performed concurrently using the

441

primers, 5 GAPDH, 5’-AAATTCCACGGCACAGTCAAG, and 3 GAPDH, 5’-

442

TGATGGGCTTTCCATTGATGA. Cycling conditions for both FIPV and GAPDH amplicons were as

443

follows: 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 58°C for 30 s,

444

72°C for 1 min. The final step included a dissociation curve to evaluate specificity of primer

445

binding. FIPV and GAPDH copy number was calculated based on standard curves generated in

446

our laboratory. Copies of FIPV cDNA determined via real-time RT PCR were normalized per 106

447

copies of feline GAPDH cDNA.

Development of anti-helicase chemical fragments

450

In general, the drugs examined and described in this study were preexisting antiviral agents. In

451

contrast, the helicase enzyme of FIPV was cloned, expressed and utilized as a target for

452

coronavirus and enzyme specific viral discovery. Target DNA sequence of AviTag-FIP Helicase-

453

HisTag was optimized and synthesized. The synthesized sequence was cloned (Adeyemi

454

Adedeji) into vector pET30a with Avi-His tag for protein expression in E. coli. E. coli strain

455

BL21(DE3) was transformed with recombinant plasmid. A single colony was inoculated into 1 L

456

of auto-induced medium containing antibiotic and culture was incubated at 37C at 200rpm.

457

When the OD600 reached about 3, cell culture was temperature was changed to 15C for 16

458

hours. Cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended with lysis buffer

459

followed by sonication. The precipitate after centrifugation was dissolved using denaturing

agent. Target protein was obtained by one-step purification using Ni column. Target protein

461

was sterilized by 0.22um filter. Yield was 7.2 mg at 0.90 mg/mL, and was stored in PBS, 10%

462

glycerol, 0.5mM L-arginine, pH 7.4. The concentration was determined by Bradford protein

463

assay with BSA as standard. The protein purity and molecular weight were determined by SDS-

464

PAGE with Western blot confirmation.

465
466

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) fragment screening was performed on a ForteBio Pioneer FE

467

SPR platform. A HisCap sensor chip, which contains a NTA surface matrix was used. Channels 1

468

and 3 were charged with 100uM NiCl2, followed by injection of 50ug/mL FIP protein. Channel 2

469

was left free of protein, as well as NiCl2, as a reference. Channel 1 was immobilized to a

470

density of ~8000 RU, while channel 3 contained about 12,000 RU. Channel 1 was used. The

471

buffer used for immobilization was 10mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20.

472

For the assay, DMSO was added to a final concentration of 4%. The proprietary compound

473

library was diluted into the same buffer without DMSO, to a final DMSO concentration of 4%

474

DMSO. Library compounds were screened at a concentration of 100uM using the OneStep

475

gradient injection method. Hits were selected based upon RU and kinetics and utilized for cell-

476

based screening.

In order to screen compounds for antiviral activity, infected CRFK cells were treated with

compounds in six well replicates and compared to positive control wells (infected cells),

effective antiviral compound) run concurrently on each tissue culture plate. CRFK cells were

483

grown in 96-well tissue culture plates (Genesee Scientific) containing 200 L culture media. At

484

~75-85% cell confluency, the media in the uninfected control wells was aspirated and replaced

485

with 200 L of fresh media. The media in the infected wells was aspirated and replaced with

486

media inoculated with FIPV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.004 infectious virions per

487

cell. The tissue culture plate was incubated for 1 hour with periodic gentle agitation (“figure

488

eight” manipulations) performed every 15 minutes to facilitate virus-cell interaction. At 1-hour

489

post-infection, each putative antiviral compound was added to six FIPV-infected wells (to assess

490

compound antiviral efficacy) and six uninfected control wells (to screen for compound

491

cytotoxicity in CRFK cells). All compounds were initially screened at 10 M, except for the

492

“chemical fragment” compounds supplied by M. Olsen (Midwestern University) which were

493

assessed at 50 M. The tissue culture plates were incubated for 72 hours at 37°C and

494

subsequently fixed with methanol and stained with crystal violet. Plates were scanned for

495

absorbance at 620 nm using an ELISA plate reader (FilterMax F3, Molecular Devices; Softmax

496

Pro, Molecular Devices). The individual well absorbance values along with the average

497

absorbance value and standard error of the mean for the 6 well experimental replicates were

498

recorded for each treatment condition.

For agents that demonstrated antiviral efficacy in the initial screening at 10 or 50 M

(protected from virus-associated CPE), the EC50 was determined by performing a progressive 2-

were grown in 96-well tissue culture plates similarly to that performed for the antiviral

screening assay. Aside from the uninfected control wells, all remaining wells were infected with

505

the FIPV as described above. The 2-fold dilution series ranged from 20 M down to 0 M and

506

each concentration performed in six well replicates. The number of dilution steps ranged from

507

6 to 14 and was compound dependent. Six well replicates of uninfected CRFK cells served as a

508

control for normal CRFK cells; six well replicates of CRFK cells infected with FIPV served as

509

untreated, FIPV-infected control wells; and six well replicates of FIPV-infected CRFK cells

510

treated with GS-441524 served as control wells for protection against virus-induced cell death

511

based on published data regarding the efficacy of GS-441524 use in vitro in CRFK cells[26].

Viral RNA knock-down assay

521

Real time RT-PCR assays were used to quantify compound inhibition of viral RNA production.

522

CRFK cells were cultured in a 6-well tissue culture plate (Genesee Biotek). At approximately 75-

523

85% cellular confluency, the culture media was replaced with fresh media and the cells were

524

infected with FIPV serotype II at a MOI of 0.2 (MOI based upon the TCID50 bioassay/pfu). Plates

525

were incubated for one hour, with periodic gentle agitation every 15 minutes. FIPV-infected

526

wells were treated with one (monotherapy), two or three (combined anticoronaviral therapy)

527

antiviral compounds; each experimental treatment was performed in triplicate. Compound

528

dosage was based upon the compounds’ EC50 and ranged from 0.001-20 M. For each

529

experimental set, three culture wells with FIPV-infected and untreated CRFK cells acted as

530

virus-infected controls. The infected cell cultures were subsequently incubated for 24 hours and

531

cell-associated total RNA was isolated using the PureLink™ RNA mini kit (Invitrogen). The RNA

532

was treated with DNAse (TurboDNAse, Ambion), reverse transcribed to cDNA using the High-

533

Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems) and FIPV cDNA and feline GAPDH cDNA were

534

measured using real time qRT-PCR, as described above. Fold reduction in viral titer was

535

determined by dividing the normalized average FIPV RNA copy number for untreated, FIPV-

536

infected CRFK cells, into the normalized average FIPV RNA copy number for treated CRFK cells

537

with the compound(s) of interest. The expected additive effect was determined by adding the

538

fold reduction for each monotherapy treatment used in combination. Fold over additive effect

539

was determined by dividing the predicted additive effect into the combined fold reduction

540

value for the particular combined therapy of interest.

541
542

Determination of Cytotoxicity Safety Profiles (CSP)

543

Compound cytotoxicity in feline cells was assessed using the commercially available kit (CellTox

544

Green Cytotoxicity Assay, Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Untreated

545

CRFK cells were used as negative controls and cells treated with a cytotoxic solution provided

546

by the manufacturer was used as the positive toxicity control. Briefly, in addition to the control

547

wells, CRFK cells were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates (Genesee Scientific) in four well

548

replicates with 5, 10, 25, 50, or 100 M concentrations of the compound of interest and were

549

incubated for 72 hours. After 72 hours, the kit DNA binding dye was applied to all wells,

550

incubated at 37˚C shielded from light for 15 minutes and the fluorescence intensity at 485-

551

500nmEx/520-530nmEm, was subsequently determined using a plate reader (FilterMax F3,

552

Molecular Devices; Softmax Pro, Molecular Devices). Compound cytotoxicity at a particular

553

concentration was assumed to be proportional to the intensity of fluorescence based on the

554

selective penetration and binding of the dye to the DNA of degenerate, apoptotic or necrotic

555

cells. The cytotoxicity range was determined by setting the fluorescence value for cells treated

556

with the positive control reagent as 100% and the untreated feline cells as 0% cytotoxicity. The

557

mean fluorescence value for the four wells containing each compound concentration were then

558

interpolated as a percentage (percent cytotoxicity) ranging from 0-100%.
