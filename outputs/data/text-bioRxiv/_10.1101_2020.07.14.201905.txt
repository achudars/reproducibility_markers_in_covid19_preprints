Abstract:

20

With the exponential spread of the COVID-19 pandemic across the world within the

21

twelve months, SARS-CoV-2 strains are continuously trying to adapt themselves in the host

22

environment by random mutations. While doing so, some variants with evolutionary advantages

23

such as better human to human transmissibility potential might get naturally selected. This short

24

communication demonstrates how the mutation frequency patterns are evolving in 2,457 SAR-

25

CoV-2 strains isolated from COVID-19 patients across diverse Indian states. We have identified

26

19 such variants showing contrasting mutational probabilities in the span of seven months. Out

27

of these, 14 variants are showing increasing mutational probabilities suggesting their propagation

28

with time due to their unexplored evolutionary advantages. Whereas mutational probabilities of

29

five variants have significantly decreased in June onwards as compared to March/April,

30

suggesting their termination with time. Further in-depth investigation of these identified variants

31

will provide valuable knowledge about the evolution, infection strategies, transmission rates, and

32

epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction:

35

Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the infection

36

has spread at a menacing rate throughout the world. As of today, over 70 million active cases of

37

COVID-19 and 1.5 million deaths are telling the horror story of this debilitating virus. Since the

38

whole genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan Hu-1 strain earlier this year, more than

39

250,000 genome sequences

40

NCBI Virus, etc. Consortiums such as Nextstrain are providing valuable, unprecedented insights

41

into the demography and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 strains along with information to

42

supervise drug/vaccine design and discovery.

1–3

have been deposited in open-source platforms such as GISAID,

43

Coronaviruses encode a 3 -5 exoribonuclease (Nsp14) that proofreads RNA 4, which tries

44

to maintain genome fidelity and control variations, although even with this, mutation rates

45

amongst these viruses are very high. However, during the past twelve months of the ongoing

46

COVID-19 pandemic, worldwide human-to-human transmission has enabled SARS-CoV-2 to

47

accumulate numerous genetic variations 5. Several mutations among these are non-significant

48

while other mutations could be beneficial for the survival of the virus, its infecting capability,

49

and transmission

50

populations, studying SARS-CoV-2 genomic variants and their tracking with time might help us

51

in understanding viral evolution, behavior, and infection trajectory.

′

′

6–9

. Given that beneficial mutations could be naturally selected in wider

52

In this study, we have tracked and identified several mutational sites for month-wise

53

(March to September; seven months) separated SARS-CoV-2 genome datasets isolated from

54

Indian COVID-19 patients to distinguish which variants are getting naturally selected to

55

propagate further and the ones which are being dismissed from the population.

Methods:

59

2,457 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Indian patients till September 30,

60

2020, were extracted from GISAID on November 1, 2020 (Table S1). From September 30 to

61

date, only eight Indian SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been submitted to GISAID, owing

62

to this, we have not used genome data after September month in this study. Based on the sample

63

collection date of each strain, we distributed them into seven categories: ‘March’ (this included

64

the strains collected in January, February, and March), April, May, June, July, August, and

65

September. The genome of the hCoV-19/Wuhan/WH01/2019 strain (EPI_ISL_406798) was used

66

as a reference throughout this analysis 3. For each category, we generated multiple sequence

67

alignment and identified the percentage of all four nucleotides (along with gap (-) and other non-

68

standard nucleotides) at each site. Sites having >2% gaps or non-standard nucleotides were not

69

considered in the analysis. The frequency of each nucleotide in the alignment was calculated and

70

a ratio was determined with the frequency of the nucleotide in the reference genome. Mutation

71

frequency/probability was defined as the ratio of the frequency of the nucleotide at any site to the

72

frequency of the nucleotide present in the reference sequence at the same aligned site. A

73

hierarchical clustering based heatmap of each nucleotide loci was generated using mutational

74

probabilities within each category using the hclust function in R. Simultaneously, trend plots

75

were also generated for all identified clusters using ggplot.

Results:

78

All 2,457 SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from the diverse landscape of India during

79

March-September 2020 were categorized into month categories (Table S1) and aligned with the

80

reference WH01 genome. This study recognized 268 sites with mutation probability ranging

81

from 2 to 97.99% in at least one month. We identified that in most of these sites, there were

82

negligible variations (>2% and <4%) amongst different month categories. Therefore, to identify

83

the critical variations in our downstream analysis, we used a 4% minimum mutational probability

84

score in at least one-month category and found 118 sites encompassing this criterion.

85

Accordingly, we identified 36, 33, 32, 36, 37, 37, and 50 highly mutating sites amongst the

86

March, April, May, June, July, August, September categories, respectively. Of these, 11 sites

87

were showing significant mutation probabilities in all seven months, 3 in six of the months, 8 in

88

four of the months, 11 in three categories, 16 in two, and 69 were unique in just a single month

89

category. Finally, the mutational probabilities of these 118 sites across all time points (month-

90

wise) were visualized using a clustered heatmap where six clusters were obtained with 4, 3, 2, 5,

91

5, and 99 sites per cluster (Figure 1AB, Table S2). The largest cluster with 99 sites did not show

92

an upward or downward longitudinal trend, therefore, it might be classified as a “neutral” cluster

93

(Figure 1AB), whereas 19 sites distributed in other five clusters showed significant variations,

94

which are discussed below.

95

Cluster one included four loci where the mutational probabilities were lowest in March

96

(2-35%) with a radical increase to >90% in June and onwards, indicative of positive selection in

97

the population (Figure 1AB, Table S2). The first site, C3037T is in the nsp3 protein-coding

98

region of the orf1a gene, C14408T is in RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) protein-

99

coding region within the orf1ab gene, the third site (A23403G) is in the spike protein-coding

100

gene, and the fourth site (C241T) is in the noncoding 5' UTR region. C3037T is a synonymous

101

mutation (F106F in nsp3 protein) and does not lead to any major changes in protein structure and

102

function. On the other hand, we noticed that C14408T mutation causes a nonsynonymous change

103

(corresponding to P125L in RdRp) which has also been observed in genomes isolated from

104

different continents suggested to change the rigidify of RdRp structure

105

A23403G, is well known to cause a D614G mutation in the spike protein, which interferes in

106

domain S1-S2 interaction. This has been suggested to cause substantial conformational shifts in

10

. The third site,

107

spike protein that in turn enhance SARS-CoV-2 infectivity while retaining sensitivity to

108

antibodies that target the receptor-binding domain

109

started showing mutations in April and in each month their frequency is expanding, reaching up

110

to 60-80% of the total population in August/September. This cluster consists of three sites, of

111

which one is synonymous mutations (Table S2) while the other two are non-synonymous and

112

worth exploring further. All three sites G28881A, G28882A, and G28883C are located

113

consecutively in the nucleocapsid gene and lead to changes in amino acids R203K, R203R, and

114

G204R, respectively.

6,7

. Sites identified in the second cluster

115

Cluster three shows a trend like cluster two however the increase in percentage

116

representation is slow and goes up to 35-60% as compared to 60-80% in the latter. It consists of

117

two sites only i.e., a synonymous mutation in C313T [nsp1 in ORF1a; L16L] and a non-

118

synonymous mutation in C5700A [nsp3 in ORF1a; A994D]. The fourth cluster consists of five

119

sites that had high mutational probabilities during early infection months, i.e., March and April,

120

and decreased mutational probabilities in May and June, and further decreasing to zero in August

121

and September, indicating that these variants are not being selected for further propagation. Two

122

out of these sites, C13730T [which results in an A4489V change in ORF1ab (A97V in RdRp

123

protein)] and C23929T [which results in a Y789Y change in spike protein], either maintain the

124

general chemical nature of the amino acid (Alanine to Valine change) or are fully synonymous.

125

However, the other three sites, C6312A, G11083T, and C28311T, result in non-synonymous

126

changes in the nsp3 region (T1198K) of the ORF1a (T2016K), the nsp6 region (L37F) of ORF1a

127

(L3606F), and the nucleocapsid (P13L) protein, respectively. Based on trends, we can

128

hypothesize that the later three non-synonymous mutations were not selected by the virus

129

population for further propagation on account of their putative lesser efficiency in infection or

130

other types of fitness disadvantages.

131

The fifth cluster consists of five sites where the mutational probabilities were making a

132

bell-shaped curve across all month-wise datasets meaning that in March and April along with

133

August and September, the mutational frequencies were in the range of 2-10%, however, we

134

could see >30% mutational representation in June and July months. G25563T site is a part of the

135

orf3a gene and leads to Q57H non-synonymous mutation. Similarly, another non-synonymous

136

mutation was identified in C28854T that leads to S194L variation in Nucleocapsid protein.

137

Other loci include synonymous mutations at C18877T [nsp14], C22444T [S], and C26735T [M],

138

which cause insignificant variations as indicated by L280L, D294D, and Y71Y, respectively.

139

Most of the sixth cluster sites have small variations ranging from 0-10% mutational

140

representations in one of the months. However, in a few sporadic sites, the representation was

141

10-40% in only one of the months and in other categories, the representation was non-significant

142

suggesting the absence of any pattern. Finally, considering the ongoing trends of these variants,

143

we hypothesize that sites identified in clusters 1, 2, and 3 must be getting selected for

144

propagation owing to some unknown fitness advantages. Similarly, as the representation of sites

145

identified in clusters 4 and 5 was higher earlier and at its lowest in the end months, we argue that

146

these sites are not getting preferred during viral population selection.

147

To counter evolutionary pressure, viruses, akin to other living beings, continuously

148

mutate their genetic material to improve their infection strategies, resistance potential to antiviral

149

therapies, and transmission rate

150

functionally insignificant. However, a few non-synonymous mutations might give an extra

151

advantage to the virus in its faster transmission, additional infection severity, or higher resistance

152

against antiviral vaccines/treatments along with other fitness advantages. Overall, this study

153

suggests that all identified mutations are not evenly distributed across the virus population during

154

different timeframes; however, some loci are more prone to propagate and some get terminated

155

with time. As several variants in clusters 1, 2, and 3 have higher mutational probability in

156

August/September as compared to March/April, understanding the consequences of those

157

propagating variants in terms of infection and epidemiology will be of great importance.

158

Exploring and recognizing this information might prove helpful for drug and vaccine

159

development. Some reports have already shown the rapid increase of a non-synonymous

160

(D614G) variant across the globe that might have facilitated increased human-to-human

161

transmission

162

insights into the evolution and fitness advantages acquired by SARS-CoV-2.

. Most of these random mutations are synonymous or

. In-depth investigations of variants identified in this study will provide newer
