ABSTRACT

29

Patients with IBD are considered immunosuppressed, but do not seem more vulnerable for COVID-19.

30

Nevertheless, intestinal inflammation has shown an important risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and

31

prognosis. Therefore, we investigated the effect of intestinal inflammation on the viral intestinal entry

32

mechanisms, including ACE2, in IBD.

33

We collected (un)inflamed mucosal biopsies from CD (n=193) and UC (n=158) patients, and 51 matched

34

non-IBD controls for RNA sequencing, differential gene expression and co-expression analysis. Organoids

35

from UC patients were subjected to an inflammatory mix and processed for RNA sequencing. Transmural

36

ileal biopsies were processed for single-cell (sc) sequencing. Publicly available colonic sc-RNA sequencing

37

data, and microarrays from tissue pre/post anti-TNF therapy, were analyzed.

38

In inflamed CD ileum, ACE2 was significantly decreased compared to control ileum (p=4.6E-07), whereas

39

colonic ACE2 expression was higher in inflamed colon of CD/UC compared to control (p=8.3E-03; p=1.9E-

40

03). Sc-RNA sequencing confirmed this ACE2 dysregulation, and exclusive epithelial ACE2 expression.

41

Network analyses highlighted HNF4A as key regulator of ileal ACE2, while pro-inflammatory cytokines and

42

interferon regulating factors regulated colonic ACE2. Inflammatory stimuli upregulated ACE2 in UC

43

organoids (p=1.7E-02), not in non-IBD controls (p=9.1E-01). Anti-TNF therapy restored colonic ACE2

44

dysregulation in responders.

45

Intestinal inflammation alters SARS-CoV-2 coreceptors in the intestine, with opposing effects in ileum and

46

colon. HNF4A, an IBD susceptibility gene, is an important upstream regulator of ACE2 in ileum, whereas

47

interferon signaling dominates in colon. Our data support the importance of adequate control of IBD in order

48

to reduce risk of (complicated) COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION

54

Since the novel betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in the province of Wuhan, China, at the

55

end of 2019, the virus has spread over more than 200 countries, causing more than 8.9 million infections,

56

including almost 470.000 death globally.1 Despite being primarily a respiratory virus, coronavirus disease

57

2019 (COVID-19) can also present with non-respiratory signs, including digestive symptoms as diarrhea,

58

nausea and ageusia.2, 3, 4

59
60

Although it is thought that SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects the lungs with transmission via the respiratory

61

route, the gastro-intestinal tract can be an alternative viral target organ. Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor

62

angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed on differentiated enterocytes, with strong

63

induction of generic viral response programs upon viral binding.5, 6 The cellular entry of coronaviruses

64

depends on the binding of the spike (S) protein to a specific receptor, followed by an S protein priming by

65

proteases, with key players ACE2 (receptor for the S protein) and TMPRSS2 (protease) in case of COVID-

66

19.6, 7, 8 Furthermore, based on protein crystal structures, data predicted that the Middle East respiratory

67

syndrome (MERS)-CoV receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP4) might act as a candidate binding target or

68

co-receptor of SARS-CoV-2.9, 10 In line, proteomic studies in COVID-19 patients suggested a prognostic

69

role for DDP4.11 Upon cellular entry in nasal goblet secretory cells, lung type II pneumocytes and ileal

70

absorptive enterocytes, an interferon-driven mechanism is initiated, including the upregulation of ACE2

71

which further enhances infection.7

72
73

Why ACE2, the S protein receptor, is abundantly expressed on intestinal epithelium, is not entirely

74

understood. Recent studies have addressed the homeostatic role of ACE2 on intestinal epithelial cells

75

demonstrating defective intestinal amino acid absorption in ACE2 deficient mice.12 Mechanistically, ACE2

76

independently of its role on the renin angiotensin system (RAS), is essential for regulating epithelial

77

tryptophan absorption, expression of antimicrobial peptides, and consequently regulating the ecology of the

78

gut microbiome promoting homeostasis and preventing intestinal inflammation.13 Thus, ACE2 regulation

79

could be link to the pathogenesis of IBD, playing a role as modulator of epithelial immune homeostatic

80

functions.

82
83

Individual susceptibility to COVID-19 may correlate with the expression of these designated (co)receptors.

84

In this respect, it is unknown how inflammation affects ACE2, TMPRSS2 and/or DDP4 expression in ileum

85

and colon. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a prototype gastrointestinal disease characterized by a

86

chronic relapsing inflammatory infiltrate of the small and/or large bowel. So far, data on COVID-19 in

87

patients with IBD are rather limited,14,

88

ulcerative colitis [UC] (as opposed to Crohn’s disease [CD]) and increasing disease activity are linked with

89

a more severe course of COVID-19. In contrast, anti-inflammatory IBD therapy has not yet been associated

90

with COVID-19 risk. Using a combination of bulk and single cell transcriptomics and organoid cultures, we

91

studied the intestinal expression of several SARS-CoV-2 co-receptors in the healthy gut and in IBD and

92

investigated whether inflammation alters co-receptor expression.

98

Hospitals Leuven, Belgium (B322201213950/S53684 and B322201110724/S52544). Endoscopy-derived

99

(un)inflamed mucosal biopsies were obtained cross-sectionally from IBD patients requiring colonoscopy

100

during routine care (Supplementary Table S1). Samples from individuals undergoing colonoscopy for

101

polyp detection were included as controls. Transmural ileal biopsies, derived during right hemicolectomy

Bulk transcriptomics

111

Inflamed biopsies were taken at the most affected site at the edge of an ulcerative surface, whereas

112

uninflamed biopsies were taken randomly in macroscopic unaffected areas. All were stored in RNALater

113

buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) and preserved at -80°C. As described previously,20 RNA from biopsies

114

was isolated using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and RNA libraries were

115

prepared using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA protocol (Illumina, San Diego, USA). RNA from organoids was

116

extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and libraries were constructed by the Lexogen QuantSeq 3’

117

mRNA-Seq Library Kit FWD (Lexogen, Vienna, Austria).19 All RNA libraries were sequenced by the Illumina

118

HiSeq4000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Raw sequencing data were aligned to the reference genome

122

The module eigengene was defined as the first principal component summarizing the expression patterns

123

of all genes into a single expression profile within a given module. Genes showing the highest correlation

124

with the module eigengene were referred to as hub genes. Pathway and upstream regulator analyses were

125

performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA, QIAGEN, Aarhus, Denmark), with network visualization

126

via Cytoscape (v3.8.0).28 Publicly available microarray datasets of ileal and colonic biopsies (GEO

Statistical analysis

173

Statistical analysis was performed using R 3.6.2 (The R foundation, Vienna, Austria). Pearson correlation

174

coefficients were computed to assess the correlation between individual genes. Multivariate analysis was

175

performed using the R package “lm.beta”. Continuous variables on graphs were expressed as median and

176

interquartile range (IQR). ACE2, DPP4 and TMPRSS2 comparisons were done using two sample t-tests or

177

Wilcoxon tests, as appropriate. In case of hypothesis-free comparisons, ie. genome-wide differential gene

178

expression analyses, multiple testing correction was applied (adjusted p [adj. p], Benjamini-Hochberg

RESULTS

182

Intestinal ACE2, TMPRSS2 and DPP4 expression in IBD patients versus non-IBD controls

183

First, we studied the expression patterns of ACE2, DPP4 and TMPRSS2 in ileum and colon biopsies from

184

351 IBD patients (193 CD, 158 UC) and 51 non-IBD controls based on bulk RNA sequencing.

185
186

In non-IBD controls, ACE2 and DPP4 expression levels were strongly increased in ileum compared to colon

187

(fold change (FC) =32.0, p=6.3E-13; FC=16.5, p=6.3E-13) (Figure 1A-B). In contrast, ileal TMPRSS2 was

188

lower compared to colon (FC=-2.9, p=6.3E-13) (Figure 1C).

189
190

When turning to tissue from IBD patients, ACE2 and DPP4 levels in uninflamed IBD ileum were similar to

191

those observed in matched control ileum (p=1.6E-01; p=8.0E-01) (Figure 1A-B). TMPRSS2 however, was

192

significantly upregulated compared to control ileum (FC=1.2, p=3.4E-02) (Figure 1C). In uninflamed IBD

193

colon, expression levels of ACE2, DDP4 and TMPRSS2 did not differ from control colon (p=2.0E-01;

194

p=3.3E-01; 2.2E-01) (Figure 1A-C).

195
196

In inflamed CD ileum, ACE2 and DPP4 expression was significantly decreased compared to control ileum

197

(FC=-2.8, p=4.4E-07; FC=-2.5, p=1.4E-06) (Figure 1A-B). TMPRSS2 behaved opposite, with a significant

198

upregulation in inflamed ileum versus control ileum (FC=1.4, p=1.8E-03) (Figure 1C). At colonic level,

199

ACE2 expression was higher in inflamed CD and UC colon than in control colon (FC=1.4, p=2.5E-02;

200

FC=1.4, p=2.0E-02 respectively) (Figure 1A). Except for a decrease in DPP4 expression in inflamed CD

201

colon versus control colon (FC=1.3, p=4.6E-02), no dysregulations were observed for colonic DPP4 and

202

TMPRSS2 (p=1.8E-01; p≤3.4E-01) (Figure 1B-C).

203
204

Despite ACE2 being X-linked, multivariate analysis did not reveal any contribution of sex to mucosal ACE2

205

expression (p=5.1E-01), nor of age (p=1.4E-01), diagnosis (p=5.6E-01) or disease duration (p=5.2E-01).

206

Intestinal ACE2 expression was significantly affected by biopsy location (p=2.8E-34) and inflammatory state

207

(p=4.2E-12).

208
209

Gene co-expression analysis of the ACE2-, DPP4- and TMPRSS2-related networks

210

To get a better understanding of the biological network of ACE2, DPP4 and TMPRSS2, we performed

211

WGCNA on all mucosal biopsies.

212
213

At ileal level, we identified 18 co-expression modules (clusters) ranging in size from 106 to 1465 genes

214

(Figure 2A). One module contained both ACE2 and DPP4 (module “blue”; 1134 genes) (Supplementary

215

Table S2). The strongest correlation with the eigengene (i.e. the principal component) of this ACE2/DPP4-

216

module was found for hub genes MMP5 (r=0.94, p=8.6E-74), ZNF664 (r=0.94, p=3.7E-71) and DPP4

217

(r=0.93, p=1.2E-68) (Figure 2A). Moreover, ACE2 also seemed to have a central role in this co-expression

218

network with a correlation value of r=0.86 (p=4.6E-45) (Figure 2A). Pathway analysis of the ACE2/DPP4-

219

module found enrichment for epithelium-related metabolic pathways such as Xenobiotic Metabolism

220

Signaling, Nicotine Degradation II and Melatonin Degradation (p<1.0E-08). Predicted upstream analysis

221

(using curated datasets in IPA) highlighted the transcription regulator HNF4A, an IBD susceptibility gene,

222

as the most likely upstream regulator of the ACE2/DPP4-module (p=1.2E-11).

223

TMPRSS2 belonged to a separate module “yellow” (1126 genes) with hub gene COA3 (r=0.92, p=4.7E-61)

224

(Figure 2A, Supplementary Table S3). Genes within this module were mainly related to mitochondrial

225

functions (eg. Oxidative Phosphorylation, Mitochondrial dysfunction and Sirtuin Signaling, p<1.6E-29), and

226

their top upstream regulator was again HNF4A (p=1.5E-27).

227
228

At colonic level, 24 co-expression modules were present ranging in size from 128 to 2267 genes (Figure

229

2B). In contrast to the ileum, colonic ACE2 and DPP4 were not co-expressed (Supplementary Tables S3),

230

with ACE2 being part of module “green” (797 genes). Here, ACE2 co-clustered with TMPRSS2. The ACE2-

231

module with top hub gene TMEM63B (r=0.89, p=5.8E-81) did not show significant enrichment for specific

232

pathways. Upstream analysis of this module ranked TNF and again HNF4A as the top regulators (p=7.7E-

233

06; p=9.4E-03).

234
235

Lastly, we studied the relationship between mucosal ACE2 and HNF4A expression levels. Ileal ACE2

236

expression strongly correlated with ileal HNF4A expression (r=0.69, p<2.2E-16), whereas colonic levels

237

showed limited correlation (r=0.2, p=1.3E-03) (Supplementary Figure S1).

238
239

Single nucleotide polymorphisms in HNF4A linked to ACE2 expression in ileum but not in

240

colon

241

As the expression of ACE2-modules was found to be driven by the IBD susceptibility locus, HNF4A, we

242

next studied the genetic variability in rs6017342 (i.e. the causal IBD variant in this locus,

243

relationship with ACE2 and HNF4A expression, both in inflamed ileum and colon. Ileal ACE2 levels were

244

lower in patients carrying the HNF4A-AA genotype, compared to patients carrying the C-allele, i.e. HNF4A-

245

Decrease of ACE2/TMPRSS2 double positive cells in inflamed ileum, but not in colon

250

ACE2 expression in the gastrointestinal tract is primarily found in absorptive enterocytes,7, 37 which could

251

indirectly be confirmed through the significant correlation (p<2.2E-16) between mucosal ACE2 and several

252

epithelial marker genes (APOA1, SI, FABP6, ENPEP) (Supplementary Figure S2). To further examine

253

the expression of genes associated with risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in IBD patients, we employed sc-

254

RNA seq to profile transmural biopsies of (un)inflamed regions of resected tissue from six CD patients

255

undergoing ileocaecal resection. Unaffected ileal tissue from five patients with CRC undergoing right

256

hemicolectomy was used as control. A total of 78,722 cells were used for downstream analyses containing

257

a similar number of cells from each type of tissue (inflamed CD, uninflamed CD and healthy tissue)

258

(Supplementary Figure S3B). Sixty-one cell clusters belonging to epithelial, immune and stromal cells

259

were obtained using unsupervised clustering (Figure 4A, Supplementary Figure S3A). Cell clusters were

260

annotated by correlating the cluster gene expression profiles with Human Cell Atlas using SingleR, as

261

previously described.38 ACE2 expression was found exclusively in epithelial cell clusters (Figure 4B-C),

262

which could also be confirmed using immunofluorescence staining (Figure 5). To define the epithelial cell

263

subtypes expressing ACE2 at deeper resolution, clusters annotated as epithelial cells by SingleR were

264

extracted and re-clustered (Figure 4D). The re-clustered epithelial cell subtypes were annotated using a

265

marker panel designed based on previous reports (Supplementary Figure S3C).39 Three enterocyte

266

clusters were identified, out of which two clusters co-expressed ACE2, TMPRSS2 and DPP4. Most

267

prominent ACE2 expression was observed in the ACE2/TMPRSS2 Enterocytes 1 cluster (Figure 4G-I,

268

Supplementary Figure S3D).

269
270

Next, we asked whether ACE2 expression varied across ileal tissue with inflammatory state, as observed

271

in our bulk transcriptomic data (Figure 1A). ACE2 expression and frequency of ACE2 positive cells were

272

clearly reduced in ileum of patients with active CD, compared to uninflamed or healthy tissue (Figure 4E-

273

F, Supplementary Figure S3E). A similar reduction of DPP4 expression was observed in the inflamed

274

samples in the ACE2/TMPRSS2 Enterocytes 1 and ACE2/TMPRSS2 Enterocytes 2 clusters (Figure 4E).

275

In line, reduction of ACE2 expression in inflamed ileum compared to healthy tissue was also confirmed with

276

confocal imaging (Figure 5).

278

To define ACE2 expression in healthy and inflamed colon, we visualized publicly available colonic sc-RNA

279

seq data containing 366,650 cells from colonic mucosa obtained in 18 (in)active UC patients and 12 healthy

280

individuals (Single Cell Portal, SCP 259) (Supplementary Figure S4A-C).31 As for the ileum, ACE2 was

281

solely expressed in colonic epithelium, mainly in a subset of enterocyte (Figure 6A-B, Supplementary

282

Figure S4D). As in the ileum, the ACE2 positive colonic enterocyte cluster co-expressed TMPRSS2 and

283

DPP4 (Figure 6B, 6E-G). However, in contrast to ileum, colonic ACE2 expression was mainly restricted to

284

enterocytes isolated form patient with active UC, while undetectable in colonic enterocytes isolated from

285

the mucosa of healthy subjects. (Figure 6C-D, Supplementary Figure S4E)

286
287
288

To compare expression and regulation of ACE2 between colon and ileum, we performed an integrated

289

analysis of epithelial cells from colon and ileum (Supplementary Figure S5A-B). In colonic ACE2 positive

290

epithelial cells, ACE2 expression was lower compared levels in ileal ACE2 positive epithelial cells (Figure

291

6H). Furthermore, using SCENIC we performed genomic regulatory networks analysis of the epithelial cells

292

to identify specific transcription programs in ACE2 expressing enterocytes, both in ileum and colon. As

293

demonstrated using bulk RNA analysis, we found a relatively higher HNF4A regulon activation in ileal ACE2

294

positive cells, compared to colonic ACE2 enterocytes (Figure 6I). Differently, colonic ACE2 expressing

295

enterocytes were found to have increased regulon activity of interferon responsive factors, such as IRF6

296

and IRF7, when compared to ileum (Figure 6I).

Ileum and colon: different key regulators in ACE2 positive cells

300

We then asked whether particular expression patterns within ACE2 positive cells depend on the tissue

301

and/or inflammatory state, and studied which upstream regulators were linked to these changes. When

302

comparing expression profiles of ACE2 positive cells from inflamed CD ileum with control ileum, we found

303

56 differentially expressed genes (adj. p<0.05, FC>2.0). Predicted upstream regulators of these genes were

304

HNF4A (inhibited, p=2.3E-04) and IFNγ (activated, p=5.2E-05). At the colonic level, we identified 54

305

differentially expressed genes in ACE2 positive cells from inflamed colon, as compared to control tissue.

Inflammatory stimuli result in upregulation of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in organoids from IBD

310

patients but not from healthy individuals

311

Because of the clear upregulation of ACE2 in inflamed colonic mucosa (Figure 1A) and the prediction of

312

TNF as key regulator in ACE2 positive cells, we investigated the effect of an inflammatory stimulus on ACE2

313

expression in an ex vivo organoid model. In organoids derived from controls, inflammatory stimuli did not

314

affect ACE2 expression (p=9.1E-01) (Figure 7A). Strikingly, in organoids derived from inflamed or

315

uninflamed colonic biopsies from UC patients, addition of an inflammatory stimulus did significantly

316

upregulate ACE2 (FC=2.4, p=1.7E-02; FC=2.0, p=2.9E-02) (Figure 7A). No significant effect on DPP4

317

expression could be observed (p=7.4E-02; p=7.9E-01), whereas TMPRSS2 was significantly upregulated

318

after inflammatory stimulation (FC=2.6, p=5.1E-14; FC=2.8, p=1.5E-30) (Figure 7B-C).

322

Given the ex vivo model clearly confirmed the effect of a pro-inflammatory mix, including TNF, on epithelial

323

ACE2 expression, we subsequently studied the effect of neutralizing TNF (through administration of

324

infliximab) on intestinal ACE2 expression in IBD patients with active endoscopic disease. Paired

325

transcriptomic data, generated prior to first infliximab administration and 4-6 weeks after treatment initiation,

326

confirmed a significant downregulation of colonic ACE2 in endoscopic remitters, but not in non-remitters

327

(p=1.8E-04, p=6.5E-01 respectively) (Supplementary Figure S6). In contrast, infliximab therapy did not

328

significantly affect ileal ACE2 expression in remitters and non-remitters (p=7.8E-02, p=2.25E-01

329

respectively).

DISCUSSION

332

Many patients with IBD have long-term exposure to corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate, small

333

molecules and/or biological agents, classifying them as high-risk patients because of their

334

immunosuppression. In addition, intestinal inflammation has shown to be an important risk factor for SARS-

335

CoV-2 infection and prognosis in IBD.14, 15, 16, 17, 18 However, emerging evidence now suggests that IBD

336

patients do not seem more vulnerable for COVID-19. To reconcile these observations, we investigated the

337

role of intestinal inflammation on the potential viral intestinal entry mechanisms through bulk and single cell

338

transcriptomics, immunofluorescence and ex vivo organoid cultures in patients with IBD.

339
340

In contrast to previous bulk data,40 we observed significant alterations in intestinal ACE2 expression

341

depending on the location and inflammatory state, both at tissue and single cell mRNA level, as at protein

342

level. ACE2 expression was limited exclusively to epithelial cells, both in ileum and colon. Hence, ACE2

343

dysregulation in bulk transcriptomics as a result of massive influx of immunocytes at the site of inflammation

344

could be excluded.

345
346

It is conceived that SARS-CoV-2 infects epithelial cells, causing cytokine and chemokine release, resulting

347

in acute intestinal inflammation characterized by infiltration of neutrophils, macrophages and T cells,41 with

348

associated shedding of faecal calprotectin and increased systemic IL-6 response,42 and IFN signaling.7

349

Similar to recent data,43, 44, 45 we found a significant downregulation of ACE2 in inflamed ileum and a

350

significant ACE2 upregulation in inflamed colon. This opposing effect of inflammation on intestinal ACE2

351

expression in small and large intestine was striking, which could be attributed - based on sc-RNA data - to

352

different key transcription factors active between ileal and colonic ACE2 positive cells.

353
354

Being an IBD susceptibility locus,46 epithelial HNF4A plays a protective role in IBD by consolidating the

355

epithelial barrier,47 especially in small intestine.48 As it appears to be a transcriptional sensor of

356

inflammation,49 and because of its key role as transcription factor in the regulation of angiotensinogen

357

metabolism,50 the decrease in ACE2 in inflamed ileum does therefore not come as a surprise. In individuals

358

carrying the minor AA genotype at the IBD HNF4A susceptibility locus, ileal ACE2 expression was even

359

further downregulated, without any effect on colonic ACE2. Of note, our sc-RNAseq data showing ACE2

360

downregulation in enterocytes from inflamed CD ileum further suggest an intrinsic regulation of ACE2. In

361

addition, as we observed significant correlations between enterocyte markers and ileal ACE2 as well as an

362

overall decrease in number of cells expressing ACE2 in inflamed CD ileum, a loss of enterocytes might also

363

explain lower ACE2 levels.

364
365

Remarkably, a very recent GWAS study identified 3p21.31 as a genetic locus being associated with COVID-

366

19–induced respiratory failure.51 This locus covers a cluster of 6 genes (SLC6A20, LZTFL1, CCR9, FYCO1,

367

CXCR6, and XCR1), with the identified risk allele (i.e. worse COVID-19 outcome) being associated with

368

increased SCL6A20 expression. Strikingly, SCL6A20 is known to be regulated by HNF4A.52

369
370

Although the colonic ACE2 co-expression cluster in bulk tissue was also enriched for HNF4A as upstream

371

transcriptional regulator, single cell data revealed that colonic ACE2 expression seems primarily driven by

372

interferon regulator factors. Upstream regulating analysis further supported that pro-inflammatory

373

cytokines, including TNF, IFNγ and IL-1β contribute to colonic ACE2 upregulation. Elevated colonic ACE2

374

levels in patients with active inflammation may thus promote viral entry and, in theory, could promote

375

COVID-19 disease severity. One can question this hypothesis as downregulated ACE2 in inflamed ileum

376

remains much higher than in normal and IBD colon. However, ACE2 expression is the most abundant in

377

the small intestine, followed by the large intestine, whereas its expression is limited in the respiratory

378

system.53, 54 While there is yet no direct evidence that altered expression of intestinal ACE2 directly impacts

379

SARS-CoV-2 intestinal entry and tropisms to different intestinal sites,55 using ex vivo organoid models we

380

confirmed that pro-inflammatory cytokines can upregulate colonic epithelial ACE2 expression in IBD

381

patients, but not in healthy individuals. Different genetic susceptibility and/or microbial composition may be

382

responsible for difference in response to inflammatory stimuli observed in controls and IBD. Indeed, it has

383

already been demonstrated that organoids from UC patients maintain some inherent differences as

384

compared to non-IBD tissue,19, 56 presumably reflecting inherent genetic factors which could result in a more

385

sensitive epithelium.

386
387

Being the key example of a complex immune-mediated entity where environmental and microbial factors

388

modulate the immune response in a genetically susceptible host,57 the differences in ACE2 expression

389

upon inflammatory stimuli between colon and ileum in patients with IBD may also be attributed to

390

differences in the intestinal microbiome. Lipopolysaccharides, comprising the wall of gram-negative

391

bacteria, was indeed identified as one of the key drivers of the ACE2 gene cluster in colon, but not in ileum.

392

However, blind use of antibiotics or probiotics for COVID-19 is not recommended until a better

393

understanding of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on gut microbiota is obtained.58

394
395

In line with our findings, national and international registries suggest active IBD as a risk factor for

396

(complicated) COVID-19.14,

397

intestinal inflammation, therefore seems key in preventing IBD patients from COVID-19. Because of the

398

significant ACE2 upregulation in colon, one might consider that active UC patients and/or CD patients with

399

colonic involvement could be at higher risk for (complicated) COVID-19, compared to ileal CD. Although

400

international registries did not yet report any outcome data split by disease location, our data would suggest

401

an increased risk for complicated COVID-19 depending on disease location and disease activity.

15, 16, 17, 18

Adequate disease management, by appropriate dampening of

402
403

Of note, several key cytokines implicated in IBD pathogenesis,57, 59 and also key drivers of ACE2 colonic

404

expression in this study, are currently under investigation as potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19,

405

including TNF, IFNγ, IL-1β and IL-6.60 Although further evidence is warranted if these anti-cytokine

406

therapies can dampen the observed cytokine storm in COVID-19, we demonstrated that anti-TNF therapy

407

does restore intestinal ACE2 dysregulation in a subset of IBD patients.

408
409

Although we acknowledge the lack of data on SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, a sequencing depth not

410

enabling to look for HNF4A alternative splicing and isoforms with pro- and anti-inflammatory effects,61 and

411

the lack of additional functional validation experiments, the replication of our findings on several levels

412

(tissue and single cell gene expression, protein expression and ex vivo models) highlights the impact of our

413

observations for the management of IBD patients in the current COVID-19 crisis. Current guidelines do not

414

promote stopping of immunosuppressive and biological drugs in IBD patients without symptoms suggestive

415

of COVID-19. On the contrary, immunosuppressive and biological drugs may protect against the

416

development of severe forms of COVID-19 infection.62

417
418

In conclusion, using bulk and single cell transcriptomic datasets, as well as ex vivo organoid cultures, we

419

demonstrated that intestinal inflammation could alter SARS-CoV-2 entry mechanisms in the intestinal

epithelium, with opposing effects seen in ileum and colon. HNF4A, an IBD susceptibility gene and

421

transcriptional regulator of one of the key Covid-19 GWAS loci, is an important upstream regulator of ACE2

422

expression in ileal tissue. In contrast, colonic ACE2 expression depends on interferon regulating factors

423

and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Overall, our translational data provide further evidence for the clinical

424

recommendation to pursue adequate disease control in patients with IBD to reduce the risk of (complicated)

COVID-19.
