Abstract

30

The dire need of effective preventive measures and treatment approaches against SARS-

31

CoV-2 virus, causing COVID-19 pandemic, calls for an in-depth understanding of its

32

evolutionary dynamics with attention to specific geographic locations, since lockdown and

33

social distancing to prevent the virus spread could lead to distinct localized dynamics of virus

34

evolution within and between countries owing to different environmental and host-specific

35

selection pressures. To decipher any correlation between SARS-CoV-2 evolution and its

36

epidemiology in India, we studied the mutational diversity of spike glycoprotein, the key

37

player for the attachment, fusion and entry of virus to the host cell. For this, we analyzed the

38

sequences of 630 Indian isolates as available in GISAID database till June 07, 2020, and

39

detected the spike protein variants to emerge from two major ancestors – Wuhan-Hu-1/2019

40

and its D614G variant. Average stability of the docked spike protein – host receptor (S-R)

41

complexes for these variants correlated strongly (R2=0.96) with the fatality rates across

42

Indian states. However, while more than half of the variants were found unique to India, 67%

43

of all variants showed lower stability of S-R complex than the respective ancestral variants,

44

indicating a possible fitness loss in recently emerged variants, despite a continuous increase

45

in mutation rate. These results conform to the sharply declining fatality rate countrywide (>7-

46

fold during April 11 – June 28, 2020). Altogether, while we propose the potential of S-R

47

complex stability to track disease severity, we urge an immediate need to explore if SARS-

48

CoV-2 is approaching mutational meltdown in India.

Author summary

55

Epidemiological features are intricately linked to evolutionary diversity of rapidly evolving

56

pathogens, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. Our work suggests the potential of average

57

stability of complexes formed by the circulating spike mutational variants and the human host

58

receptor to track the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a given region. In India, the

59

stability of these complexes for recent variants tend to decrease relative to their ancestral

60

ones, following countrywide declining fatality rate, in contrast to an increasing mutation rate.

61

We hypothesize such a scenario as nascent footprints of Muller’s ratchet, proposing large-

62

scale population genomics study for its validation, since this understanding could lead to

63

therapeutic approaches for facilitating mutational meltdown of SARS-CoV-2, as experienced

64

earlier for influenza A virus.

Introduction

80

The emergence and rapid global spread of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome

81

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-

82

19), has led to an unprecedented worldwide public health crisis, crossing the species barrier

83

and disseminating rapidly through the global population [1]. Like any other rapidly evolving

84

emerging pathogens, effective preventive measures and treatment approaches call for an in-

85

depth understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and its association with

86

the epidemiological data [2, 3], especially with distinct attention to specific geographic

87

regions. Nature and strength of selection pressures acting on the pathogen can vary across

88

different ethnicities, countries, or even among specific administrative regions (such as states

89

or provinces) within a country like India, China, USA, largely because of the implementation

90

of social distancing via lockdown as a preventive measure against the geographic spread of

91

the pathogen between and within countries.

92

The transmembrane spike glycoprotein protrudes from the viral surface and is

93

responsible for viral attachment, fusion and entrance into the host cells, thereby establishing

94

the infection [4, 5]. The two most notable genetic features of this protein are (a) the binding

95

of its surface unit (S1) to the human cellular receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2

96

(hACE2), and (b) the fusion of viral membrane with a host cell membrane via its

97

transmembrane unit (S2). The S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domains (RBD)

98

supporting the stabilization of the membrane-anchored state of the S2 subunit along with its

99

fusion machinery [6-11]. Some previous works have acknowledged that extensive and

100

irreversible conformational changes stimulate the cleavage of spike protein, thereby

101

activating it for membrane fusion [11-17]. Though it is not yet confirmed if the differences

102

owing to conformational changes are aiding to the expansion of SAR-CoV2 varieties

103

increasing or decreasing its infectivity or transmissibility, but the researchers confirmed the

4

104

spike proteins to be the key pathogenic determinant that differentiates SAR-CoV2 from other

105

SARS-related coronaviruses [17]. It is predicted that mutations in the spike protein increases

106

or decreases protein glycosylation, thereby enhancing or reducing the viral uptake by host

107

cells [18-22]. Although the RBD in the spike protein is known as the most important player

108

to recognize the host receptor, it is highly likely that the region outside of this C-terminal

109

domain in S1 subunit as well as the domains of S2 subunit also influence the host-receptor

110

binding allosterically.

111

The present study analyses spike protein variants from Indian isolates to understand

112

the evolutionary patterns and driving forces behind the emerging SARS-CoV-2 infection and

113

its potential epidemiological footprints in India. We detected a strong correlation between the

114

average stability of complexes formed by the circulating spike protein variants with the host

115

receptor (S-R complex) and the disease severity of a given location, suggesting the S-R

116

complex stability as a potential marker to assess the severity of the disease. Importantly,

117

majority of the emerging variants showed decreased stability, indicating accumulation of

118

deleterious mutations in the spike protein. This conforms to the declining fatality rates of the

119

disease countrywide. Could the fixation of these deleterious mutations in the population lead

120

to mutational meltdown, following Muller’s ratchet dynamics of evolution?

Methods

124

Analysis of sequence diversity and reconstruction of phylogeny

125

The average pairwise nucleotide diversity (π) and the rates of synonymous (dS) and

126

nonsynonymous (dN) mutations for the spike protein-coding genes were calculated using

127

MEGA version X [23]. TimeZone software [24] was used to reconstruct the maximum-

128

likelihood based phylogeny to map the protein variants and identify convergent amino acid

129

changes (i.e. repeated independent or phylogenetically unlinked mutations at the same amino

130

acid positions). The spike gene sequence from Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 genome was used as

131

reference to detect the orthologs in the sequenced Indian genomes based on a threshold value

132

of 95% for both nucleotide sequence diversity and gene length coverage.

133
134

Identification of spike protein variants unique to India

135

All 17529 spike protein sequences from worldwide isolates available till May 9, 2020

136

in the GISAID database (https://www.gisaid.org/) were downloaded. We implemented CD-

137

HIT Suite [25, 26] to cluster all the spike protein sequences considering 100% amino acid

138

sequence identity as ortholog clustering criteria, and detected a total of 3706 clusters. Of

139

these clusters, we considered 3577 clusters matching the complete length of spike protein

140

(1273 amino acids), using the sequence from Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 (GenBank accession number

141

MN908947) as reference. These 3577 spike protein sequences were aligned using ClustalW

142

program [27, 28]. The resulting alignment was compared with Indian mutational variants

143

mapped in the previous step to distinguish the variants unique to Indian isolates.

144
145

Analysis of state-wise diversity of spike protein variants

146

For each Indian state, we computed the number of spike protein variants and the

147

frequency of each of those variants. The state-wise calculation of variant diversity was

148

performed using Simpson’s index [29].

149
150

Modeling of spike protein – hACE2 complex variants

151

Variants of the ancestral spike protein (Wuhan-Hu-1/2019) were built by homology

152

modeling using Swiss modeler [30] with the aid of available templates (residue range: 27-

153

1147) using Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 isolate as reference [17, 31]. X-ray crystal structure of the

154

human ACE2 was used from the complex of receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein

155

with hACE2 (PDB code: 6lzg) [32]. We docked the RBD (residue range: 331-524) of spike

156

protein (residue range: 27-1147) mutants to the binding site of hACE2 using HADDOCK

157

webserver [33, 34] by providing binding site information [31, 35]. HADDOCK score (often

158

mentioned as docking score in the text), with some arbitrary unit, signifies a measure

159

determined by weighted sum of intermolecular interactions, such as electrostatic and van der

160

Waals interactions between protein and ligand, desolvation energy, restraint violation energy

161

and the buried surface area upon binding. For each docked complex HADDOCK score was

162

estimated and VMD [36] was used to visualize the structures.

165

Results

166

Two major ancestors circulating in India lead to a burst of spike protein variants.

167

We identified a total of 630 isolates with complete gene sequences encoding the spike

168

protein based on the submissions of Indian SARS CoV-2 genome sequences to GISAID till

169

June 7, 2020 (S1 Table). The samples analyzed were isolated from 17 states and 2 union

170

territories of India, collectively called as ‘states’ hereafter. We found a countrywide average

171

pairwise nucleotide diversity (π) of 0.048±0.02%. The rates of synonymous (or silent) and

172

nonsynonymous (or amino acid replacement) mutations were found to be 0.097±0.05% and

173

0.033±0.02% respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed the Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 variant of

174

the spike protein as the most ancestral one, as expected, while the D614G variant emerged

175

from the Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 variant appeared to be another stable variant circulating in the

176

Indian population. Since both these variants have established themselves in the worldwide

177

population as two major ancestors of SARS CoV-2 spike protein variants, we here onwards

178

will refer the Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 and D614G variants as ancestor 1 and ancestor 2

179

respectively.

180

Apart from giving rise to ancestor 2, the ancestor 1 led to a total of 20 variants (Fig 1

181

and S2 Table). Of these, the variant K77M evolved further to yield three more variants

182

isolated from three different states (Bihar, Tamil Nadu and Telengana), suggesting the

183

emergence of K77M as another stable variant. On the other hand, the ancestor 2 showed

184

about twice more diversity by giving rise to 47 variants (Fig 1 and S2 Table). In this ancestor

185

2 clade, several variants (L5F, T22I, L54F, G261S, T572I, E583D, Q677H, A706S, H1083Q)

186

indicated their stability in the population via mutating further, giving rise to additional

187

variants. Besides, although the ancestral variants were predominant in the population

188

circulating in India, we detected a total of 16 variants of spike proteins that were represented

189

by multiple isolates (Fig 1), from 2 to as many as 9 isolates, indicating the possible fixation

190

of some of these variants in the population irrespective of the stability of S-R complex. Of

191

these, an array of mutations in 8 variants (at positions 5, 54, 78, 558, 574, 583, 677, 1243)

192

showed their convergent nature, where those mutations at the same positions were

193

phylogenetically unlinked, i.e. repeated independently (S2 Table). Interestingly, 53% of the

194

total set of variants detected in Indian population was found unique, i.e. not found in 17529

195

worldwide genomic isolates analyzed from the GISAID database till May 09, 2020 (S2

196

Table). We believe that this considerable level of uniqueness could be an expected scenario

197

in almost all geographical regions where a newly emerging, rapidly evolving viral pathogen

198

tries to adapt to a new host, and many of these variants might be detrimental to the fitness of

199

the organism. However, specific positive selection pressures could also play a role in this

200

mutational pattern which needs to be studied separately in some greater depth.

206

lower stability index respectively of the S-R complex for each variant than the major

207

ancestral variant it emerged from (either Ancestor 1 or Ancestor 2). The black arrows lead to

208

the variants for which the docking scores could not be determined either because of the

209

presence of at least one variation outside the available template region for docking [17, 31],

210

or due to non-existing isolate in the lone hypothetical node with H1083Q mutation denoted

211

by black color. This black node signifies a variant with no available isolate in our dataset,

212

while it gives rise to two derived variants, H1083Q:R78M and H1083Q:E583D, for which

213

representative isolates were available.

The average stability index of S-R complex correlates strongly with the fatality rates in

216

a given location.

217

We next looked into the distribution of these spike protein variants across Indian

218

states (S3 Table). As we computed the diversity based on both richness and evenness of spike

219

variants, some of the states like Maharashtra, Odisha, West Bengal and Gujarat demonstrated

220

significantly higher (P<0.05) diversity of circulating variants than most of the remaining

221

states. However, while we had 196, 97, 75 and 73 sequenced isolates from Gujarat,

222

Telengana, Delhi and Maharashtra respectively, the remaining states were represented by

223

even lower sample size (ranging from 1 to 48 isolates. Of these, Delhi variants showed lowest

224

diversity, significantly different from both Maharashtra (P=0.0002) and Gujarat (P=0.0006),

225

though not from Telengana (P=0.16). On the other hand, Maharashtra variants presented

226

much higher diversity than Telengana (P=0.017) or Gujarat (P=0.21).

227

It is expected that these variations might be in response to strong selection pressures

228

acting on the spike protein, especially its S1 subunit which, being a major immunogenic

229

target for the host, plays the pivotal role to evade the host immune response and to offer a

230

successful viral entry. Therefore, the mutational variations in spike proteins can essentially

231

affect the stability of the S-R complex. To assess this, we modeled each of the spike protein

232

variants, and then docked to the binding site of host receptor, hACE2, using HADDOCK

233

webserver [33, 34] of data-driven docking algorithm by providing binding site information as

234

the same was already established from the crystal structure [32, 35]. In the circulating

235

variants, we detected a significant excess (P=0.035) of mutations in the S1 subunit (with 41

236

mutations) compared to the S2 subunit (with 22 mutations). The mutation positions in the

237

secondary structures of the analyzed variants are detailed in the S1 Dataset in supporting

238

information.

239

The docking score (HADDOCK score) of each variant on hACE2 is hereafter

240

designated as the stability index of S-R complex. More negative is the docking (HADDOCK)

241

score, higher is the stability of the S-R complex [37]. Under the assumption that better

242

stability would lead to better invasion of the virus into the host, we hypothesize that such a

243

stability index of a given spike protein variant could be linked to the severity of viral

244

pathogenicity. To test this hypothesis, we measured the severity as the ‘fatality rate’

245

calculated simply as the ratio of the number of deceased people to the number of recovered in

246

a given state (available from the Government of India website: www.mygov.in/corona-

247

data/covid19-statewise-status/).

248

While we aimed to estimate an average stability index of a given state based on the

249

stability indices of circulating variants in that location, we were handicapped with the

250

available sample size and the information of collection diversity. Considering this issue, we

251

restricted our study to the states having 50 or more sequenced samples for analysis.

10

252

Therefore, we could assess the association of average stability index with fatality rates for

253

three states and one union territory (Maharashtra, Gujarat, Telengana and Delhi) which

254

qualified our sample size threshold. Importantly, these four regions harbored 70% of all

255

samples analyzed across 19 states, while their variant diversity ranged from the highest to one

256

of the lowest (S3 Table).

257

We detected a strong exponential correlation (R2=0.96) between the average stability

258

index of circulating spike variants of the region with the fatality rate in that region (Fig 2).

259

While Telengana and Delhi showed comparable average stability index values with ~7%

260

fatality rates, Maharashtra and Gujarat had exponentially higher stability index values (i.e.,

261

more negative docking or HADDOCK scores) with 8% and 9% fatality rates respectively. It

262

is highly plausible that the spike protein, as the primary controller of both the attachment to

263

the host cell surface and the initiation of infection by fusing the viral and the host cell

264

membranes, would be represented by variants with varying efficiency of the virus to enter

265

human cells, and to get transmitted among people [17]. However, our conclusions based on

266

the available initial data are premature due to low sample size per location and lack of direct

267

evidence for the correlation between spike protein variant’s docking score and the pathogen’s

268

contribution to host fatality, thereby warranting population-level robust association analysis

269

and experimental validations.

277

The emerging spike protein variants showing reduced stability of S-R complex are

278

significantly abundant.

279

Of 630 isolates analyzed, Ancestors 1 and 2 were represented by 253 and 248 isolates,

280

suggesting their steady circulation across India. However, the remaining ones, i.e. more than

281

20% isolates represented relatively recently emerged variants out of two ancestral variants.

282

Interestingly, a quick look at Fig 1 showed that, for majority of the variants derived from the

283

Ancestor 1 and Ancestor 2, the stability was reduced (having less negative stability index

284

values) relative to their respective ancestors. We therefore plotted the trend of those emerging

285

variants with reference to their ancestral backgrounds (Fig 3). Significant majority (χ2

286

P=0.03) of the variants that emerged from the two ancestral variants showed reduced stability

287

(having less negative docking scores) from their respective ancestors. This picture got even

288

more prominent (χ2 P=0.009) when we looked into exclusively the variants which were

289

detected multiple times in the dataset, i.e. represented by more than one isolate (sometimes

290

collected from different states), thereby suggesting possible fixation of those variants in the

291

population (S2 Table). Interestingly, 13 of these variants with multiple occurrences

292

accumulated mutations exclusively in S1 subunit, while only 3 variants showed all mutations

293

in S2 subunit, which might be suggesting an increased selection pressure in the S1 subunit

294

because of its key role in the viral entry and the presence of the receptor binding domain.

302
303

At this point, we can propose that the relatively recent variants emerging from the

304

ancestors in India are losing their ability on an average to form a stable complex with the

305

human receptor as compared with their ancestors, which could possibly result in lower

306

countrywide fatality rate, if we combine our earlier observation of the direct correlation

307

between average stability index and fatality rate. Conforming to this proposal, we found that,

308

after an initial steady increase of fatality rate for the first four weeks, the fatality rate reached

309

a peak at 38.2% on April 11, 2020, followed by a continuous sharp decline at 5.3% on June

310

312

was found to be increasing during the three-month period from March till May 2020 during

(i.e. amino acid replacement) mutation rate (from 0.027% in March to 0.033% in May 2020)

315

was detected to be about 14% higher than the increase in synonymous mutation rate (from

316

0.091% in March to 0.097% in May 2020), suggesting a stronger selection pressure for amino

acid changes in the spike protein.

Could Muller’s ratchet be a player in shaping SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary dynamics in

327

India?

328

In evolutionary genetics, Muller’s ratchet signifies accumulation of deleterious

329

mutation in a population leading to ‘mutational meltdown’, leading to a gradual extinction of

330

that population [38]. In general, genetic mutations that provide adaptive advantages are fixed

331

in the population by natural selection whereas deleterious ones are wiped off from the

332

population. However, an accelerated mutation rate puts huge mutational pressure, and natural

333

selection is unable to wash out these deleterious mutations, retaining the newly formed

334

variants within the population and thereby leading to their fixation. This irretrievable

335

evolutionary mechanism is coined as Muller’s ratchet by evolutionary biologists [39]. When

336

more and more deleterious mutations are accumulated and become permanent in the

337

population, this results in ‘mutational meltdown’ or ultimate loss of the population [40, 41].

338

It is known that the apparent tendency to directly correlate the high mutation rate of

339

virus with its infectivity and transmissibility is without merit [42]. On the other side, it has

340

been suggested that Muller’s ratchet, via mutational meltdown, could be a key player in

341

leading the SARS-CoV-2 population to gradual extinction due to accumulation and fixation

342

of deleterious mutations in future [40, 43]. On one hand, we observed that the stability of S-R

343

complex is directly linked to the fatality rates, while the continuous emergence of variants

344

from the ancestral ones were found to be less stable compared to their ancestors. As we

345

combine these findings with the countrywide data of a sharp decline in the fatality rate over

346

time, we propose the possibility of mutational meltdown in action for SARS-CoV-2 in India,

347

indicating Muller’s ratchet as a plausible game-changer for COVID-19 scenario here in near

348

future.

349

We understand that, only in three months, we cannot expect a radical increase in the

350

mutation rate to give rise to any significant accumulation of deleterious mutations that could

351

have offered a prominent picture of mutational meltdown. However, our results altogether

352

point toward the trend, thereby suggesting the potential of future studies in this otherwise

353

overlooked domain of microbial dynamics, which could in turn lead to a possibility of a

354

successful therapeutic approach [40, 43].

Discussion

358

Our work has combined genetic and epidemiological data of SARS-CoV2 in India to

359

decipher a direct correlation between the average stability of S-R complexes for the

360

circulating spike protein variants and the fatality rate of a geographic region. The docking

361

score of S-R complex, designated here as the stability index, is estimated by protein-protein

362

docking based on intermolecular interactions, such as electrostatic and van der Waals

363

interactions, desolvation and restraint violation energies along with buried surface area upon

364

binding via detection of the correct binding pose. This score, in essence, quantifies the

365

stability of the docked complex by optimizing global minimum energy conformation of the

366

complex [44, 45]. On the other side, while it is probable that a better stability of S-R complex

367

could lead to an increased viral load and maybe an increased infectivity, previous works

368

showed that the spike protein – hACE2 complex is crucial for viral pathogenesis by causing

369

acute lung damage [46, 47], which suggests a direct link between S-R complex stability and

370

fatality rate. However, the robustness of the potential of S-R complex stability index for the

371

spike protein variants as a tracker of fatality rate or disease severity needs to be studied in

372

greater depths with more structured region-specific patient data (that are primarily available

373

to selected government/non-government agencies) in connection with larger population-level

374

sequence datasets for the given locations.

375

As expected for any fast-moving pathogen outbreaks [42], we find an increasing rate

376

of mutations, while the extent of increase is much higher for the nonsynonymous (amino acid

377

replacement) changes. Interestingly, the S-R complex of a significant majority of variants

378

tend to lose stability relative to their two most stable ancestral variants. Alongside, the

379

countrywide data show a continuous sharp decline in the fatality rate after an initial surge.

380

Therefore, keeping in mind the observed correlation between the S-R complex stability and

381

fatality rate across Indian states, here we pose an open question for future research: Does the

382

phylodynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in India indicate any nascent action of Muller’s ratchet

383

where the otherwise deleterious mutations tend to get fixed in the population as natural

384

selection remains unable to purge them due to excessive mutational pressures? If so, there

385

lies an immense potential of using therapeutics that could facilitate such a process of

386

mutational meltdown, as was demonstrated earlier for influenza A virus [48, 49]. Therefore,

387

future large-scale population genomics analysis supported by epidemiological information is

388

of high importance to explore this question for India as well as for other countries across the

389

globe to develop efficient analytical methods, thereby guiding better surveillance programs,

390

prevention and treatment management of COVID-19.

Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the diversity of spike protein variants circulating in India, using
maximum likelihood-based phylogeny reconstruction. Each node represents a specific spike protein
variant, while the node-size and the number inside depict the frequency of that variant. The red or green
color of each arrow indicates the higher or lower stability index respectively of the S-R complex for each
variant than the major ancestral variant it emerged from (either Ancestor 1 or Ancestor 2). The black arrows
lead to the variants for which the docking scores could not be determined either because of the presence of
at least one variation outside the available template region for docking(18, 42), or due to non-existing
isolate in the lone hypothetical node with H1083Q mutation denoted by black color. This black node
signifies a variant with no available isolate in our dataset, while it gives rise to two derived variants,
H1083Q:R78M and H1083Q:E583D, for which representative isolates were available.

Fig. 2. Heat map distribution across four Indian states with >50 sequenced isolates based on average
stability index. The average stability index for a particular state denotes the averaged value of docking
scores / HADDOCK scores of S-R complexes for all circulating variants. The values of average stability
index and fatality rate in Indian states are plotted to fit an exponential function (R2=0.96).
