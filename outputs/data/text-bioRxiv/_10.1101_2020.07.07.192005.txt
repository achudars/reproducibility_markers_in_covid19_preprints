Abstract
The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emergence in
2003 introduced the first serious human coronavirus pathogen to an unprepared world.
To control emerging viruses, existing successful anti(retro)viral therapies can inspire
antiviral strategies, as conserved viral enzymes (eg., viral proteases and RNAdependent RNA polymerases) represent targets of choice. Since 2003, much effort
has been expended in the characterization of the SARS-CoV replication/transcription
machinery. Until recently, a pure and highly active preparation of SARS-CoV
recombinant RNA synthesis machinery was not available, impeding target-based high
throughput screening of drug candidates against this viral family. The current Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic revealed a new
pathogen whose RNA synthesis machinery is highly (>96% aa identity) homologous to
SARS-CoV. This phylogenetic relatedness highlights the potential use of conserved
replication enzymes to discover inhibitors against this significant pathogen, which in
turn, contributes to scientific preparedness against emerging viruses. Here, we report
the use of a purified and highly active SARS-CoV replication/transcription complex
(RTC) to set-up a high-throughput screening of Coronavirus RNA synthesis inhibitors.
The screening of a small (1,520 compounds) chemical library of FDA-approved drugs
demonstrates the robustness of our assay and will allow to speed-up drug repositioning
or novel drug discovery against the SARS-CoV-2.

1.Introduction
The current worldwide Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis highlights the
urgent need of cost-effective drugs able to control the SARS-CoV-2 at the earliest
stage of infection (Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). Such a drug would find its
usefulness immediately after a patient's positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, to help
quarantine effectiveness and acceptance, control clusters of cases, reduce potentially
severe outcomes, and ultimately curb the epidemics. A huge effort is being pursued
across the world to find drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Towards this endeavor,
one of the most potentially rapid ways is to screen chemical libraries of FDA-approved
compounds. Under favorable conditions, an approved drug can be compatible with its
novel antiviral indication, and thus go under accelerated clinical evaluation (Cheng et
al., 2019).
Antiviral drug discovery can be conducted through several screening methods, each
having its advantages and drawbacks. Phenotypic screening makes use of virus
infected cells which are rescued when a compound prevents or dampens the
consequences of the infection, as judged by cytopathic effect or virus production readouts. In this type of process, the target of the identified hit is not known, and thus, hit
expansion is conducted in a somewhat blind manner. Several methods exist to
determine the viral or cellular target, allowing potential rapid hit-to-lead development
implemented in conjunction with structural biology techniques and functional assays.
Amongst the advantages of this method, drug uptake by the cell, metabolic
activation/decay, and primary bioavailability and toxicity features are included in the
screening process.
Target-based screening generally proposes to select ligands or inhibitors through the
use of the purified target known to play a critical role for pathogen propagation. Besides
the insurance of knowing the actual inhibitor target, the immediate advantage is that
screening can be performed in standard BSL-1 or 2 laboratories, and hit expansion is
immediately and greatly facilitated by functional assays, often guided by available
structural data on the target of interest. Obvious disadvantages are that an excellent
inhibitor may never cross cellular membranes nor reach its target in the cell.
Clearly, both types of screening methods are required, and even more importantly,
they are complementary to expedite drug design, from discovery to hit-to-lead
optimization.
Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) represent an extremely attractive
target for antiviral drugs due to their high level of sequence and structural conservation
and vital role in viral replication (Venkataraman et al., 2018). Furthermore, they do not
have any cellular homologues in the eukaryotic cell, which means that virus specific
inhibition and drug selectivity can be achieved. This has been beautifully demonstrated
by, amongst others, the design of Sofosbuvir, a nucleotide analogue occupying the
foremost position in the fight against the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The later virus has
been the subject of intense antiviral research due to its prevalence worldwide, and an
expected flourishing market for antiviral drugs concomitant to various difficulties
around vaccine design (Ji et al., 2019).
The situation is blatantly different for SARS-CoV, whose drug market has remained
difficult to evaluate after its emergence in 2002 and subsequent vanishing in the middle
of year 2003 (Pruijssers and Denison, 2019). Another reason for the lagging research
of SARS-CoV is its sophisticated and multi-subunit RNA synthesis machinery (Snijder
et al., 2003). It was only in 2014 that nsp7 and nsp8 were identified as co-factors of

the RdRp core nsp12 and shown to confer full activity and processivity to nsp12
(Subissi et al., 2014).
These finding were corroborated by the Cryo-EM structure determination of the nsp78-12 SARS-CoV RNA synthesis complex in 2019, followed by that of SARS-CoV-2 in
2020 (Gao et al., 2020; Kirchdoerfer and Ward, 2019). The structure shows the nsp12
RdRp core bound to one molecule of nsp7 and two molecules of nsp8. Furthermore,
the structure described by Hillen et al. suggest that nsp8 acts as a “sliding pole” for
processivity of RNA synthesis (Hillen et al., 2020). Although it is not known if this
represent one of the biologically relevant form(s) of the SARS-CoV Replication
Transcription Complex (RTC), it does suggest that there is both biochemical and
functional relevance to consider the nsp7-8-12 complex as the minimum RTC required
for synthesis of the coronavirus ~30,000 nt RNA genome.
The SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses are highly homologous, with a 79% overall
amino acid sequence identity along the genome (Wang et al., 2020). Remarkably, the
SARS-CoV nsp12 amino acid sequence is 96 % identical to that of SARS-CoV-2, and
amino acid polymorphisms involve conservative changes. The genome is translated
into two large polyproteins originating from Orf1a and Orf1b, the latter being expressed
from a ribosomal frameshift occurring at the end of Orf1a. Orf1b codes for a set of five
conserved replication proteins, among which nsp12 carries the polymerase activity
when supplemented with Orf1a products nsp7 and nsp8. In the core polymerase
domain, amino acid differences between SARS-CoV-1 and 2 map to the surface of the
protein, not onto any of the conserved motif A to G, indicating that SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis properties should be nearly identical (Shannon et al.,
2020).
In this paper, we use the nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 proteins of the SARS-CoV to
assemble a highly active RNA synthesis complex. We optimize reaction conditions to
set-up a non-radioactive nucleotide polymerization assay with a signal-to-noise ratio
appropriate for a robotized high-throughput screening (HTS) assay. We validate this
HTS assay through a screening campaign using the Prestwick Chemical Library® of
1,520 FDA-EMA approved compounds, and report detailed inhibition profiles of two
series of hits.

2.3 Setting up of the RTC activity experimental conditions based on a fluorescent
readout
2.3.1 Determination of the Poly(A) template concentration
Picogreen kinetic assay was based on polymerase activity of SARS nsp12 in complex
with nsp7L8, which catalyzed the reaction using a poly (A) template and uridine
triphosphate (UTP). The reaction (160 µl) was carried out at 30oC in 50 mM Hepes pH
8, 10 mM DTT, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 500 µM UTP and 150 nM nsp12
as final concentrations. The final Poly(A) concentration varied from 5 nM to 500 nM.
To reconstitute an active replicase, nsp7L8 was used in a 10-fold molar concentration
excess compared to nsp12 as described. Nsp12 and nsp7L8 were incubated for 5 min
in the presence of Poly(A) before starting the reaction with UTP addition.
30 µl of Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) 100 mM were added into each well of
a 96 wells black flat bottom plate (Greiner Bio-One ref 675076). At each time interval
(5;7.5;10;15;20;30 and 45 min), 20 µl of reaction was added into wells on the plate with
EDTA to stop the reaction. The plate was then incubated 5 minutes in the dark with
1/800 Picogreen® in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5). The plate was
read on Tecan Safire II using software Magellan 6 (excited light at 480 nm, emitted
light at 530 nm, optimal gain).
The assay was done in triplicate. Velocity values of each condition were determined
using the Prism software by calculating the slope of the linear phase and then plotted
against the Poly(A) template concentration to determine the Km (Poly(A)) and Vmax
values by using Michaelis-Menten fitting.
2.3.2 Optimizing UTP concentration
UTP variation assay was performed in the same conditions as described above, with
the defined Poly(A) optimum concentration of 350 nM, except for the final UTP
concentration, which varied from 50 µM to 1 mM. At each time interval (5;7.5;10;15;20;
30 and 45 min), 20 µl of reaction was added into wells on the plate with EDTA to stop
the reaction. The assay was experimented three times., Velocity values of each
condition were determined using the Prism software by calculating the slope of the
linear phase and then plotted against the UTP concentration to determine the apparent
Km app (UTP) value by using Michaelis-Menten fitting or Hill fitting.
2.3.3 Optimizing enzyme concentration
Enzyme variation assays were performed in the same conditions as described above
(Poly(A) 350 nM, UTP 500 µM) except for the final enzyme concentration, which varied
from 20 nM to 250 nM. Background and optimal gain values (given by TecanSafire 2)
of each assay were determined and analyzed, using Prism software, to obtain the final
best condition.
2.3.4 Time course of the SARS-COV RTC assay
To assess the optimized conditions of the polymerase activity of the SARS nsp12nsp7L8 complex, a reaction time course was performed using 350 nM poly (A)
template, 500 µM UTP and 150 nM nsp12 enzyme, testing nsp12 alone, nsp7L8 alone
or the nsp12/nsp7L8 complex. Nsp7L8 is in a 10-fold molar concentration excess
compared to nsp12 concentration. Nsp12 and nsp7L8 were incubated at room
temperature for 5 min in the presence of Poly (A) before starting the reaction by the
addition of UTP. As a comparison, the assay was performed with the DV-2 polymerase
(100 nM Poly (U) template, 300 µM ATP, 10 nM Enzyme as already described

(Benmansour et al., 2016). Experiments, performed in triplicate, were analyzed using
the Prism 5 software.
2.4 Robotization of the RTC assay.
The assay was performed in 96-well Nunc plates. The chemical library is from
Prestwick Chemical. The 1520 compounds are distributed in 19 plates, with 80
compounds per plate and the first and 12th columns with DMSO. Each of the 80
compounds were added to the reaction mix using a BioMek I5 workstation (Beckman)
to a final concentration of 20 µM in 5% DMSO. Reactions were conducted in 40 μL
final volume. The enzyme mix containing both nsp12, nsp7L8 and the Poly (A)
template was incubated 5 min at room temperature to form the active complex. For
each assay, 20 μL of this enzyme mix was distributed in wells using a Biomek 4000
(Beckman), containing 2 μL of the compounds. Reactions were initiated by addition of
18 μL of the nucleotide mix (500 μM UTP) and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. Assays
were stopped by the addition of 20 μL of EDTA (100 mM). Reaction mixes were
transferred to a Greiner plate using a Biomek I5 Automate (Beckman). Picogreen
fluorescent reagent was diluted to 1/800 in TE buffer according to manufacturer’s data,
and 60 μL of reagent was distributed into each well of the Greiner plate. The plate was
incubated for 5 min in the dark at room temperature, and the fluorescence signal was
read at 480 nm (excitation) and 530 nm (emission) using a TecanSafire2.
Positive and negative controls consisted respectively of a reaction mix with 5% DMSO
final concentration or EDTA 100 mM or Hinokiflavone 10 µM instead of compounds.
For each compound, the percentage of inhibition was calculated as follows: Inhibition
% = 100 (raw_data_of_compound − av(pos)/(av(neg) − av(pos)).
Compounds leading to a 30% inhibition or more at 20 µM were selected to further
investigations.
The Z’ factor is calculated using the following equation: Z’ = 1 – [3(SD of max) + 3(min
SD)] /[(mean max signal) - (mean min signal)], where SD is the standard deviation.
2.5 IC50 determination based on the fluorescent Picogreen® assay
The compound’s concentration leading to a 50% inhibition of polymerase mediated
RNA synthesis was determined in IC50 buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 10 mM KCl, 2
mM MnCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT) containing 350 nM of Poly(A) template, 150 nM
of nsp12 in complex with 1.5 µM nsp7L8 using 7 different concentrations of compound.
Five ranges of inhibitor concentration were available (0,01 to 5 µM / 0,1 to 50 µM / 0,5
to 50 µM / 1 to 100 µM / 5 to 400 µM). According to the inhibitory potency of the
compound tested, a range was selected to determine the IC50. Reactions were
conducted in 40 µL on a 96-well Nunc plate. All experiments were robotized by using
a BioMek 4000 automate (Beckman). 2 µl of each diluted compound in 100% DMSO
were added in wells to the chosen concentration (5% DMSO final concentration). For
each assay, the enzyme mix was distributed in wells after a 5 min incubation at room
temperature to form the active complex. Reactions were started by the addition of the
UTP mix and were incubated at 30°C for 20 min. Reaction assays were stopped by
the addition of 20 µl EDTA 100 mM. Positive and negative controls consisted
respectively of a reaction mix with 5% DMSO final concentration or EDTA 100 mM
instead of compounds. Reaction mixes were then transferred to Greiner plate using a
Biomek I5 automate (Beckman). Picogreen® fluorescent reagent was diluted to 1/800°
in TE buffer according to the data manufacturer and 60 µl of reagent were distributed
into each well of the Greiner plate. The plate was incubated 5 min in the dark at room

temperature and the fluorescence signal was then read at 480 nm (excitation) and 530
nm (emission) using a TecanSafire2.
IC50 was determined using the equation: % of active enzyme = 100/(1+(I)2/IC50), where
I is the concentration of inhibitor and 100% of activity is the fluorescence intensity
without inhibitor. IC50 was determined from curve-fitting using Prism software. For each
value, results were obtained using triplicate in a single experiment.
3. Results
3.1 Determination of the experimental conditions of the SARS-CoV RTC fluorescent
assay
The nsp12 RdRp activity is dependent on the presence of the nsp7 and nsp8 proteins
(Subissi et al., 2014). We made use of a 1:10 ratio of nsp12:nsp7L8 which provides
appropriate levels of RdRp activity. A HTS assay was developed with a non-radioactive
readout. We used conditions similar to the HTS Dengue Virus (DV) polymerase assay
previously developed on our platform. Briefly, the homo-polymeric NTP template was
incubated with nsp12:nsp7L8, and the polymerase activity is detected through a
fluorescent dye which intercalates upon the synthesis of double stranded RNA
(dsRNA). Nsp12 protein and nsp7L8 complex were expressed and purified separately
(Fig S1).
We first evaluated the effect of the poly(A) concentration. Maximal SARS-CoV RTC
activity was obtained with a Poly(A) concentration of 350 nM, allowing a stable and
reproducible signal (Fig. 1A). To define the optimal UTP concentration, the velocity of
the RTC was assessed at different UTP concentrations. We observed a non MichaelisMenten curve with a significant lag-phase (Fig. 1B, full line), and therefore it was not
possible to caculate a reliable Km concentration for the robotized assay using standard
kinetic modeling. Using a Hill equation fit, we observed an allosteric cooperation with
a Hill coefficient of 1.72 (Fig. 1B, dotted line). The UTP concentration to be used was
defined at 500 µM, as it corresponds to the beginning of the saturation phase. Finally,
to reach 80% of the maximum activity, the nsp12 concentration was set to 150 nM (Fig.
1C).
Using the conditions established above (350 nM poly(A) template, 500 µM UTP with
150 nM nsp12 and 1.5 µM nsp7L8) a time course up to 60 min was performed (Fig. 2).
In contrast to the DV2 polymerase, the SARS-CoV RTC complex exhibits a significant
lag phase (Fig. 2). To obtain sufficient levels of activity, a reaction time of 20 min. was
determined to be suitable for inhibitor screening. As expected, nsp12 alone, or nsp7L8
alone, in the same conditions, did not exhibit any polymerase activity (Fig. 2).
3.2 IC50 determination of reference inhibitors of the SARS-CoV RTC
To develop the HTS of the SARS-CoV RTC, reference inhibitors had to be selected.
In absence of specific inhibitors of the SARS-CoV RTC we first tested a nucleotide
analogue (NA), 3’dUTP, along with a large spectrum of non-specific RNA synthesis
inhibitors: Hinokiflavone, Amentoflavone, Quercetin and Apigenin (Coulerie et al.,
2012). IC50s values range from 0.95 µM for Hinokiflavone to 96 µM for Apigenin (Fig.
3), demonstrating the discriminating capacity of the HTS assay. The 3’dUTP IC50 is
measured at 6.7 µM under our experimental conditions.
3.3 High-throughput screening

The total of 1,520 compounds from the Prestwick Chemical Library® (PCL) were tested
using the SARS-CoV-RTC assay. The Prestwick Chemical Library ® is a unique
collection of small molecules, mostly approved drugs (FDA, EMA and other agencies)
selected by a team of medicinal chemists and pharmacists for their high chemical and
pharmacological diversity as well as for their known bioavailability and safety in
humans.
The Z’ value was calculated based on the ten control wells on each microplate,
resulting in an overall Z’-score of 0,8 +/-0,06 for all the chemical library used in the
screen. The screening was performed using 20 µM of compounds in 5% DMSO in a
single assay. Based on a cut-off of 30% inhibition, the calculated hit rate is 3.02% (46
hits) and the repartition of identified compounds according their percentage of inhibition
was indicated in Figure 4. Based on these results, three main families of molecules
were identified: anthracyclines, tetracyclines and detergents, the two first of which were
further investigated (Tables A1 and A2).
3.4 IC50 determination
Eight anthracyclins were identified with inhibitory potential from zero to 100% at 20 µM
(S table 1). Regarding the five determined IC50s, they perfectly correlated with the
calculated percentage of inhibition at 20 µM of the HTS. Four of the five anthracyclins
tested were in the same range of IC50s (from 15 to 44 µM). The remaining one, Prestw385, exhibited a sub-micromolar IC50 (0.34 µM ± 0.05) which was in the same range
than Hinokiflavone, the inhibitor control (Fig. 5A).
Ten tetracyclins were identified in the PCL, with inhibitory potential up to 74% at 20 µM
(S table 2). Again, the calculated IC50 values for these compounds was found to
perfectly correlate to the percentage of inhibition at 20 µM. Three tetracyclins showed
IC50s of 20 µM or higher (Prestw-1000; Prestw-145; Prestw-140) while Prestw-456 and
Prestw-1799 exhibited lower IC50s of 3.2 and 5.7 µM respectively (Figure 5B).
4. Discussion
In this study we have established a robust HTS assay with a fluorescent readout for
the SARS-CoV RTC. The overall hit rate for the PCL screen is ~3%, with a cut-off of
30% of inhibition. Obviously, at this stage the identified hits are active only on the
SARS-CoV RTC and have by no means been deemed suitable for medication.
Regarding the selected two families of molecules, the anthracyclins and the
tetracyclins, the number of identified molecules did not allow Structure Activity
Relationship (SAR) studies. Rather, it is important to outline the accuracy of the IC50s
of the primary screening, as well as the reproducibility of the IC50s regarding the
calculated standard errors. With the exception of the anthracyclins, which have been
described as potential intercalating molecules, it is not known at this stage if these
compounds are indeed intercalating, denaturing, or low specificity agents having a
mechanism of action suitable for advanced drug design. Preliminary testing in SARSCoV-2 infected cells indicate that none of the compounds described here show
significant antiviral activity (data not shown).
In summary, this work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first description of a robust
HTS assay based on a SARS-CoV RTC. It provides a new strategy for the rapid
identification of potential anti-SARS inhibitors. The next steps already under
development include increasing the output by scaling up the assay to 384 and
potentially 1536 wells plates. Furthermore, the screening of large chemical libraries

derived from innovative approaches as virtual screenings or Protein Protein Interaction
inhibitors (iPPI) will broaden the scope of potential antivirals and constitute a key step
to speed up these objectives. Identification of candidate anti-coronavirus drugs, based
on a diversity of chemical libraries, should expedite drug discovery and design, and
constitute an invaluable help to confirm the target of hits identified during cell-based or
phenotypic screens.

(A)Poly(A) template variation with SARS nsp12 in complex with nsp7L8
Velocity values of SARS nsp12 (150 nM) in complex with nsp7L8 (1.5 µM) was
measured for various concentrations in Poly (A) template (5; 10; 20; 40; 60; 80; 100;
150; 200; 350; 500 nM). Using the Prism software, velocity values of each condition
were determined by calculating the slope of the linear phase of the kinetic and then
plotted against the Poly(A) template concentration by using Michaelis-Menten fitting.
Data were the results of three independent experiments.
(B) Nucleotide variation with SARS nsp12 in complex with nsp7L8
Velocity values of SARS nsp12 (150 nM) in complex with nsp7L8 (1.5 µM) was
measured for various concentrations in UTP (50;80;100;150;200;350;500 ;650;800
and 1000 nM). Using the Prism software, velocity values of each condition were
determined by calculating the slope of the linear phase of the kinetic and then plotted
against the UTP concentration by using Michaelis-Menten equation (full line) or Hill
equation (dot line) to determine the apparent Km (UTP) of the SARS-CoV-RTC. Data
were the results of three independent experiments.
(C) Variation in SARS nsp12 in complex with nsp7L8
Velocity values obtained during a time course with 350 nM Poly (A) and 500 µM UTP
were plotted against different concentrations in SARS nsp12 in complex with nsp7L8.
The concentration ratio nsp12:nsp7L8 was conserved at 1:10. Curve was fitted
according the Hill equation.

The polymerase activity of 100 nM DV2-NS5 pol (●), 150 nM ns12 in complex with 1.5
µM nsp7L8 (▲) , 150 nM nsp12 alone (Δ) or 1.5 µM nsp7L8 alone (□) were measured
in a time course (0;2;5;7.5;10;20;30 and 60 min). The produced doubled strand RNA
was detected by adding an intercalant reagent (Picogreen®) and by measuring the
fluorescence emission at 530 nM. Each assay was performed three times (mean value

Fig. 4
Number of compounds from PCL on the screening of SARS-CoV RTC, according
to their inhibitory potential.

Based on their efficiency on the SARS-CoV RTC assay, the number of compounds
with more of 30%; 40%; 50%; 60%; 70%; 80%; 90% and 100% inhibition were
evaluated. The exact value was indicated in white above each bar graph. (Only
compounds with more 30% inhibition of the polymerase activity in the assay were
represented. Frequent Hitter and fluorescent compounds were excluded). The Z’ value
was calculated based on the ten control wells on each microplate, resulting in an
overall Z’ score of 0,8 ± 0,06.
