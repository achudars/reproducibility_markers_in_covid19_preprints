Abstract (69 words)

47

The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demands rapid identification of immunogenic

48

targets for the design of efficient vaccines and serological detection tools. In this

49

report, using pools of overlapping linear peptides and functional assays, we present

50

two immunodominant regions on the spike glycoprotein that were highly recognized

51

by neutralizing antibodies in the sera of COVID-19 convalescent patients. One is

52

highly specific to SARS-CoV-2, and the other is a potential pan-coronavirus target.

Main

54

In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology was reported

55

in the city of Wuhan in the province of Hubei. The previously unidentified pathogen,

56

which induces symptoms resembling an infection by the Severe Acute Respiratory

57

Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was later identified as a novel coronavirus,

58

SARS-CoV-2 [1]. Within a span of four months, there are more than 750,000

59

laboratory-confirmed cases of human Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), with

60

over 35,000 deaths across 199 countries and territories (For up to date information

61

consult https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-

62

reports/). After being declared a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on

63

11th March 2020, there is a compelling need to understand and develop effective

64

therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2.

65

SARS-CoV-2 uses the spike (S) glycoprotein to bind to the angiotensin-

66

converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor with a better affinity than SARS-CoV S

67

glycoprotein for entry [2]. Thus, blocking the binding to ACE2, or blocking host

68

protease cleavage to release the fusion peptide is an efficient strategy to prevent

69

coronavirus entry [3-5]. To date, one study has assessed the immunogenicity of

70

structural domains of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein [6]. At the time of writing,

71

findings on SARS-CoV-2 linear epitopes remain limited to bioinformatics prediction of

72

human B and T-cell epitopes using SARS-CoV as a model [7-9]. Five regions on the

73

S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV (residues 274-306, 510-586, 587-628, 784-803 and

74

870-893) were predicted to be associated with a robust immune response [7], while

75

other studies reported candidate epitopes [8, 9] that require validation with human

76

patient samples.

77

In this brief communication, we report the antibody profiles of COVID-19

78

patients, and the identification of two immunodominant linear B-cell epitopes on the

79

S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 that are crucial in controlling infection. A total of 25

80

convalescence serum samples collected during the current COVID-19 outbreak in

81

Singapore were screened at 1:1000 dilution for neutralizing antibodies against a

82

pseudotyped lentivirus expressing SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein tagged with a

83

luciferase reporter (Figure 1a). Of the 25 patients tested, six patients (2, 4, 6, 7, 11,

84

20) with sufficient amount of serum samples that displayed a good neutralizing

85

activity were selected for further functional characterization. Sera from all patients

86

showed similar IC50, ranging from a titre of 694 to 836, except patient 20, who

87

showed the strongest neutralizing activity with an IC50 of 1603 (Figure 1b).

88

Next, we assessed the antigenic targets of these sera using a linear B-cell

89

peptide library spanning the entire S protein of either SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2

90

with pools of five overlapping peptides (Figure 1c, Supplementary Figure 1b).

91

Interestingly, two distinct peptide pools from SARS-CoV-2 S library, pools S14 and

92

S21, were strongly detected by sera from COVID-19 patients, and not by recovered

93

SARS patients (17 years post disease recovery) (Figure 1c, Supplementary Figure

94

1b). Sera from recalled SARS patients could neutralize SARS-CoV, but not the

95

SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentiviruses (Supplementary Figure 1c). Moreover,

96

COVID-19 patients sera could strongly detect SARS-CoV S library pool S51, which

97

partially overlaps with SARS-CoV-2 pool S21 (Figure 1c, Supplementary Figure 1b).

98

This region encompasses the fusion peptide, which is highly conserved among

99

coronaviruses [10, 11], suggesting a potential pan-coronavirus epitope at this

100

location. Interestingly, targeting this region was also demonstrated to neutralize

101

infection with a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor peptide [12]. Surprisingly, no linear

102

epitope was identified in the receptor binding domain (RBD) which suggest that

103

antibodies targeting that region are mostly conformational epitopes. Further

104

assessment of individual peptides within pools S14 and S21 narrowed down the

105

specific region of interest to peptides S14P5 and S21P2, respectively (Figure 1d).

106

Recognition of these regions was stronger for the peptides of SARS-CoV-2 than

107

SARS-CoV (Figure 1e). Together, these findings suggest that these linear B-cell

108

epitopes are dominant antigenic regions, which corroborated previous bioinformatics

109

predictions [7].

110

Using a recently published structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in prefusion

111

conformation [2], peptide S14P5 is localized in proximity to the RBD (Figure 2a). As

112

such, it is plausible that antibodies binding to this region may sterically hinder binding

113

to ACE2 receptor, thereby abolishing virus infection [13]. Another possibility could be

114

an allosteric effect on ACE2 binding. Similarly, peptide S21P2 contains a part of the

115

fusion peptide sequence, which may potentially affect virus fusion (Figure 2b). In

116

order to assess the importance of these regions in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection,

117

antibody depletion assays were performed against S14P5 and S21P2 (Figure 2c).

118

Depletion efficiency and specificity was validated by ELISA, showing that only

119

antibodies against the respective peptides were depleted but not other unrelated

120

antibodies (Figure 2d). Interestingly, sera that were depleted for antibodies targeting

121

either peptides S14P5, S21P2, or S14P5+S21P2 led to a significantly reduced ability

122

to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection, as compared to the non-depleted

123

sera controls (Figure 2e).

124

Our results demonstrate that the two B-cell linear epitopes identified in this

125

study are immunodominant. Depletion assays functionally validated that antibodies

126

targeting S14P5 and S21P2 peptides possess significant neutralizing roles against

127

SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped lentiviruses. Importantly, we also assessed the potential

128

presence of mutations in the peptide regions and found a low rate of mutations for

129

S14P5 and S21P2 with low to moderate impact on the viral sequence (2 and 24

130

mutations out of 2596 viral genome sequences respectively, supplementary table 3)

131

[14]. These results are essential to guide the design and evaluation of efficient and

132

specific serological assays, as well as help prioritize vaccine target designs during

133

this unprecedented crisis.

SARS-CoV (pools S32-62) in duplicates. Sera of pooled healthy donors (n=13) were carried out in parallel. Data were
normalized against healthy controls and the subtracted OD values are presented in a heat-map. Blue and pink indicate
low and high OD values, respectively. (d-e) Determination of SARS-CoV-2 specific and pan-CoV linear B cell epitopes
on S protein. (d) Sera of COVID-19 patients (n=6) were subjected to peptide-based ELISA for IgG detection using
individual peptides of SARS-CoV-2 S peptide pools 14 and 21. The z-score values of patient were calculated using the
formula [value – average (OD value of patient) / standard deviation (OD value of patient)]. Data shown are from two
independent experiments and presented as mean. (e) Peptide binding response of COVID-19 patients on SARS-CoV-2
peptides S14P5 and S21P2, and the corresponding regions on SARS-CoV peptides S45P3 and S51P5, respectively.
Statistical analysis was carried out with paired parametric two-tailed t-test (*p<0.05).

Figure 2. Antibodies against S14P5 and S21P2 linear B-cell epitopes neutralize SARS-CoV-2. (a-b) Localization
and sequences of (a) SAR-CoV-2 specific S14P5 and (b) pan-CoV S21P2 epitopes on spike (S) protein (PDB: 6VSB)
are shown. Each S monomer is denoted as either pink, blue or orange. (c-e) Pooled sera of COVID-19 patients (n=6)
were added to plates coated with the corresponding peptides to deplete specific antibodies. (c) Non-depleted and
peptide-specific antibody-depleted sera were then subjected to peptide-based ELISA of the peptide (d) or were crossassayed. Data of depleted sera (white) were normalized to percentages of the non-depleted sera (black). Signal from
pooled healthy donor sera were displayed as black dotted lines and data are shown as mean ± SD. (e) Non-depleted
and peptide-specific antibody-depleted pooled sera were then mixed with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus before incubating
with CHO-ACE2 cells for 48 h. The percentage of neutralization against pseudovirus infection, relative to the nondepleted sera, are shown. Data are presented as mean ± SD, and signal from pooled healthy donor sera were
displayed as black dotted lines. Statistical analysis was carried out with one-sample t test (*p<0.05, **p<0.01).
