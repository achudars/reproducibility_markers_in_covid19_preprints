Abstract
Upstream of the 3’-untranslated region in the SARS-CoV-2 genome is ORF10 which has
been proposed to encode for the ORF10 protein. Current research is still unclear on whether
this protein is synthesized, but further investigations are still warranted. Herein, this study uses
multiple bioinformatic tools to biochemically and functionally characterize the ORF10 protein,
along with predicting its tertiary structure. Results indicate a highly ordered, hydrophobic, and
thermally stable protein that contains at least one transmembrane region. This protein also
possesses high residue protein-binding propensity, primarily in the N-terminal half. An assessment
of forty-one missense mutations reveal slight changes in residue flexibility, mainly in the C-terminal
half. However, these same mutations do not inflict significant changes on protein stability and other
biochemical features. The predicted model suggests the ORF10 protein contains a β-α-β motif with
a β-molecular recognition feature occurring in the first β-strand. Functionally, the ORF10 protein
could be a membrane protein. A single pocket was identified in this protein but found to possess
low druggability. The ORF10 itself consists of two distinct lineages: the SARS-CoV lineage and
the SARS-CoV-2 lineage. Evidence of positive selection and purifying selection were found to be
occurring within the SARS-CoV-2 lineage and SARS-CoV lineage, respectively. Collectively,
these results continue to assess the biological relevance of ORF10 and its putatively encoded
protein, thereby aiding in diagnostic and possibly vaccine development.

1. Introduction
An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China has resulted in a
global pandemic causing, at the time this manuscript was prepared, well over 70,475,000 cases
and 1,599,000 deaths.1 The virus responsible for causing COVID-19, severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), contains an individual copy of a single-stranded
positive-sense RNA genome that is ~29.8 kilobases in length.2 In particular, the 3’-terminus
encompasses multiple open reading frames (ORFs) that encode four main structural proteins: the
spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins.2 In addition, shorter
length ORFs have been detected and proposed to encode for approximately nine different
accessory proteins (3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8, 9b, 9c, 10) in the SARS-CoV-2 genome.2,3 Past research
indicates these accessory proteins are dispensable for viral growth in vitro; however, the genes
encoding for these proteins are maintained in the coronavirus (CoV) genome, suggesting they
might play important roles within the environment of the infected host.4
To some degree, all of these accessory proteins have been structurally and/or functionally
characterized. For example, the 3a protein was shown to induce apoptosis whereas the 9b
and 9c (i.e. ORF14) proteins were suggested to be involved within membrane interactions during
virion assembly and host-virus interactions, respectively.5,6 Prior work has detected expression
of RNA transcripts corresponding to these proteins in SARS-CoV-2; however, RNA transcripts
belonging to ORF10 have not been observed in large amounts.3,7 Pancer et al. 2020 had also
identified several SARS-CoV-2 variants with prematurely terminated ORF10 sequences, finding
that disease was not attenuated, transmission was not hindered, and replication proceeded
similarly to strains possessing intact ORF10 sequences.8 In light of these findings, there is some

uncertainty regarding the biological relevance of ORF10 in SARS-CoV-2, with suggestions that its
genome annotation should be amended. As an unintended consequence, this putatively encoded
protein in SARS-CoV-2 has remained somewhat understudied.
Found upstream of the 3’-untranslated region (3’-UTR), ORF10 (117 nt long) encodes for
a protein that is 38 amino acids in length.9 Although there exists sequences homologous to
the ORF10 protein in other closely related bat and pangolin CoVs, there are no experimentally
derived crystallographic structures for the ORF10 protein.10,11 Studies attempting to predict the
secondary structural elements of this protein indicate one α-helix and, depending on the study,
two β-strands.12,13 The ORF10 protein also lacks significant levels of disorder; however, a short
molecular recognition feature (MoRF) likely spans residues 3-7.12 This protein is hydrophobic with
the α-helix having been identified as a possible transmembrane (TM) helix as well.14
The exact implications are unclear, but the ORF10 protein contains high numbers of
promiscuous cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes, primarily on the α-helix.12,15 A recent study
by Liu et al. 2020 found that in severe cases of COVID-19, the ORF10 was overexpressed when
compared against ORF10 expression levels in moderate cases.16 If the ORF10 protein is
synthesized, this may help to partially explain the nature behind severe cases of COVID-19. The
large number of CTL epitopes in conjunction with the overproduction of the ORF10 protein could
result in elevated immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2, leading to some potentially fatal
immunopathological outcomes.
The ORF10 protein was shown to associate with the CUL2ZYG11B complex by interacting
with the substrate adapter ZYG11B, thereby overtaking the complex to modulate aspects of
ubiquitination and enhance viral pathogenesis.13 However, the mechanisms and residues involved

in this interaction have not been described in detail. Alternatively, ORF10 may act itself or serve as
a precursor for other RNAs in regulating gene expression/replication, translation efficiency, or
interfering with cellular antiviral pathways.7
Two lineages for the ORF10 have been observed. The SARS-CoV lineage consists of
sequences interrupted by a stop codon (TAA) encoding for a truncated protein and was found to be
undergoing neutral evolution (dN/dS = 1.18).14 The SARS-CoV-2 lineage consists entirely
of uninterrupted sequences encoding for a complete protein and was found to be undergoing strong
positive selection (dN/dS = 3.82) without relaxed constraints.14 This has led to the possibility
that the ORF10 in SARS-CoV-2 and closely related CoVs might encode a conserved and
functional protein. Furthermore, the ORF10 present in SARS-CoV-2 and closely related CoVs is
thought to have evolved from a mutation occurring within the ancestral stop codon originally found
in the SARS-CoV lineage at nucleotide position 76.17
Collectively, there still remains few efforts spent on investigating the ORF10 protein
within SARS-CoV-2. Herein, this current study uses a bioinformatic approach to characterize this
protein, along with providing an updated phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis. This study also
further examines the structural and biochemical effects of mutations found in this protein, along
with assessing its potential as an antiviral drug target.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Sequence, Phylogenetic, and Evolutionary Analysis
The nucleotide (NC_045512.2) and protein (YP_009725255.1) reference sequences
for ORF10 in SARS-CoV-2 were acquired from the NCBI RefSeq Database. BLASTn was used
to collect additional sequences from both distantly and closely related CoVs (Table S1). Sequence
alignments were performed using MUSCLE on the MEGA-X v10.1.7 software.18,19 Alignment
reliability and total similarity were determined by overall mean distance and calculated using
the p-distance substitution model. If the p-distance was found to be ≤ 0.7 then the alignment was
considered reliable and suitable for subsequent analyses.20
A single phylogenetic gene tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method and
visualized on MEGA-X.21 Uniform rates among sites and complete deletion were used. The
phylogeny was tested using the bootstrap method.
The average nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution (dN/dS) rate was calculated using
the single-likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC) method.22 To determine either relaxed (k < 1) or
intensified (k > 1) selection, the RELAX method was utilized.23 Both methods were performed
using the datamonkey webtool (http://datamonkey.org/). Wu-Kabat variability coefficients were

calculated using the protein variability server (http://imed.med.ucm.es/PVS/).24

2.2 Protein Characterization and Secondary Structure Prediction
Per-residue disorder scores were determined using several online tools as previously
described.25 Scores were averaged to calculate overall protein disorder. To detect phosphorylation
sites, the DEPP server (http://www.pondr.com/cgi-bin/depp.cgi) was used. A hydrophobicity plot

was generated using ProtScale.26 The grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY), aliphatic index,

and instability index were determined using ProtParam.26 The propensity of residues involved in
protein-binding were evaluated by SCRIBER.27 Secondary structural elements were predicted
using PSIPRED v4.0.28 TM regions were predicted using TMPred.29
2.3 Protein Modeling and Evaluation
The webserver IntFOLD was employed to make use of an ab initio modeling approach
in constructing the ORF10 protein.30 Models were evaluated based on quality and confidence
scoring. The best model was then refined using the 3Drefine webserver.31 Of the models generated
post-refinement, the one with a higher qualitative model energy analysis (QMEAN) global Z-score
was viewed as most favorable.32 This final model was evaluated by PROCHECK and ERRAT on
the SAVES v6.0 webtool (https://saves.mbi.ucla.edu/).33-35 This theoretical structure was deposited

in ModelArchive (https://modelarchive.org/) and given the ID: ma-9yzbf. Global and local quality

comparisons against two previously constructed models were also performed.36,37
The ProFunc server predicted the function of the ORF10 protein based on the newly
produced model.38 The online web server DoGSiteScorer was used to predict and describe pockets
within the ORF10 protein.39 A druggability score was returned between 0 and 1. The higher the
score, the more druggable the pocket was estimated to be. UCSF Chimera v1.15 was used to
visualize the model.40 Electrostatic surfaces were generated based on the AMBER ff14SB charge
model. Hydrophobicity surfaces were produced according to the Kyte-Doolittle scale.
2.4 Mutation Analysis
Using forty-one ORF10 protein variants, the effect these mutations had on protein stability
and other biochemical features were determined. The same methods that were used to determine
the GRAVY, instability index, aliphatic index, and per-residue disorder scores were used to

evaluate the effects of these mutations. The effect each mutation had on protein stability was
determined using the I-MUTANT v2.0 webtool.41 The free energy change value (DDG) predictor
was used to assess changes in stability brought on by each mutation. If a negative value is returned,
then the stability of the protein decreases. If a positive value is returned, then the stability of the
protein increases. The designated temperature and pH used were 25℃ and 7, respectively.

3. Results
3.1 Sequence, Phylogenetic, and Evolutionary Analysis
The whole nucleotide alignment (p-distance = 0.08) had 92% similarity. The phylogenetic
gene tree revealed two lineages (Figure 1a). The SARS-CoV lineage (p-distance = 0.04) had 96%
similarity whereas the SARS-CoV-2 lineage (p-distance = 0.08) had 92% similarity. An alignment
of protein sequences taken from the SARS-CoV-2 lineage revealed a total of thirty-one conserved
sites (Figure 1b). A Wu-Kabat plot displayed higher variability coefficients in the C-terminal
half (20-38) rather than the N-terminal half (1-19) of the ORF10 protein, with amino acid position
twenty-five presenting the highest variability coefficient in the lineage (Figure 1c).
The SARS-CoV lineage had a dN/dS = 0.713 to indicate purifying selection. Oppositely,
the SARS-CoV-2 lineage had a dN/dS = 4.01 (Figure 1a). To determine if this dN/dS ratio was
either the result of positive or relaxed purifying selection, the RELAX method was used. In doing
so, a k = 6.79 was obtained; therefore, the hypothesis of a relaxed constraint was rejected in favor
of strictly positive selection acting upon the SARS-CoV-2 lineage.
3.2 Protein Characterization and Secondary Structure Prediction
A per-residue disorder plot for the ORF10 protein in SARS-CoV-2 showed that residues
within both termini held the highest disorder scores whereas moving inwards resulted in gradually
decreasing scores (Figure 2). The average disorder score for the ORF10 protein was 0.095, which
indicates a highly ordered protein. No specific phosphorylation sites had been detected within this
protein (Table S2). The GRAVY score was 0.637 to indicate a very hydrophobic protein. The
aliphatic and instability indices were 107.03 and 16.06, respectively. Both of these values suggest a
thermally stable protein. The hydrophobicity plot uncovered two hydrophobic regions covering

residues 3-19 and 28-36, along with a hydrophilic region covering residues 20-27 (Figure 3a). As
for protein-binding propensity, residues in the N-terminal half had a tendency to possess greater
scores than residues found in the C-terminal half (Figure 3b). In particular, residues 1-14 presented
with a stretch of relatively high propensity scores to implicate this region's possible involvement
in protein-binding (Figure 3b).
Secondary structure prediction suggests there exists a single α-helix (residues 11-21) and
two β-strands (residues 4-8 & 26-34) in the ORF10 protein (Table S3). Furthermore, a TM region
was predicted to span residues 3-19, corresponding to one of the hydrophobic regions that was
shown in the hydrophobicity plot (Figure 3a).
3.3 Protein Modeling and Predictive Function
IntFOLD produced five different ORF10 protein models (Table S4). The model having the
lowest p-value (3.33e-03) and highest quality score (0.3714) was subjected to refinement. Of
the five protein models generated post-refinement, the model with a QMEAN Z-score of -0.66 was
selected as most favorable (Table S5). This final model had an ERRAT score of 93.333 and
a Ramachandran plot indicated that 94% of residues (32 total) existed in the most favorable region
while only 6% of residues (2 total) existed in the additional allowed region (Figure S1). Functional
analysis results by ProFunc have been summarized (Table 1). The predicted ontological terms were

based on “long shot” hits using a reverse template comparison against known Protein Data Bank

structures; therefore, these functional characteristics should not be viewed as definitive.
Structurally, the model presented with a β-α-β motif spanning residues 3-31, along with
a 3/10-helix spanning residues 34-37 (Figure 4a). An electrostatic surface map revealed two
regions of positive charge and one region of negative charge (Figure 4c). Electropositive regions

were influenced by R20 and R24 whereas the electronegative region was influenced by D31. As
expected, a majority of the protein’s surface was hydrophobic; however, hydrophilic regions did
appear (Figure 4d). For example, residues spanning 20-27 presented with surface coloring that
reflected hydrophilic character, as was shown in the hydrophobicity plot (Figure 3a).

A single hydrophobic pocket was detected using DoGSiteScorer (Figure 4b). This pocket

had a volume of 78.14 Å³, a surface area of 221.79 Å², and a depth of 5.31 Å. This pocket had a

total of 19 hydrophobic interactions, followed by 8 hydrogen bond acceptors and 3 hydrogen bond

donors. The druggability score for this pocket was 0.14 and interpreted as a poor drug target.

Prior to this study, two ORF10 protein models were built using different methods. The first

model was constructed using the QUARK web server whereas the second model was built using

the I-TASSER web server.36,37 Both models were different in terms of secondary structure and

topology (Figure S2). The QMEAN global Z-scores (QUARK: −3.88 / I-TASSER: −2.63) for

both models were lower, suggesting that the model produced in this study had higher global, and

also local, quality (Figure S3).
3.4 Mutation Analysis
One missense mutation per variant was observed. The longest conserved region only
spanned residues 15-16 (Figure 5). Per-residue disorder scores in the N-terminus did not fluctuate
as much when compared to per-residue disorder scores in the C-terminus (Figure 2). Regardless,
the average disorder for each variant indicated highly ordered proteins. The predicted effects that
each missense mutation had on protein structure, stability, and other biochemical features have
been summarized (Table 2).

4. Discussion
In this study, the evolutionary history for ORF10 is similar to the history previously
described by Cagliani et al. 2020.14 Currently, there exists two distinct and conserved lineages for
the ORF10 in CoVs: the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Both lineages are easily
distinguishable based upon whether they encode for either a truncated (SARS-CoV lineage) or
full-length (SARS-CoV-2 lineage) protein. The SARS-CoV lineage is undergoing purifying
selection whereas the SARS-CoV-2 lineage is undergoing positive selection without any relaxed
constraints. A bat-CoV (SARS-related-CoV Rc-o319) isolated from Japan in 2013 possessed an
uninterrupted ORF10 sequence with approximately 95% nucleotide and 87% amino acid similarity
to ORF10 in SARS-CoV-2.10 Following the addition of this new sequence, this study provides an
updated phylogenetic and evolutionary look at ORF10 and continues to reinforce the current
hypothesis that positive selection is occurring within the SARS-CoV-2 lineage. These data also
suggest that ORF10 might encode a functional and conserved protein in SARS-CoV-2 and other
closely related bat and pangolin CoVs. In addition, this lineage has greater amino acid variations in
the C-terminal; however, the cause behind this remains unclear.
The prediction of secondary structural elements for the ORF10 protein describe the
presence of one α-helix and two β-strands. When compared to the structural assignment of residues
in the ORF10 protein model, only 76% of residues match. One significant difference was the
model contained a 3/10-helix at the C-terminus. Since this model is predicative and no
experimentally derived structure yet exists for the ORF10 protein, this 3/10-helice’s existence along
with its structural and functional role is unclear. The local scoring for residues in this structure were
also lowest in comparison to the rest of the model. According to Hassan et al. 2020, a MoRF was

12

predicted to occur in residues 3-7.12 A unique feature associated with MoRFs is their ability to exist
in semi-disordered (i.e. flexible) states until binding, after which they can assume designated
secondary structures.42 Therefore, residues 3-7 (or 3-8) might function as a β-MoRF that upon
binding to a corresponding protein ligand, will assume the structure of a β-strand. Residues in this
region associate with a predicted β-strand, and have disorder scores reflecting residues that possess
moderate flexibility to accommodate slight changes in structure.
Protein disorder predictions show the ORF10 protein in SARS-CoV-2 is highly ordered. It
is only near each terminus that residues begin to indicate some degree of flexibility. These results
contradict those by Hassan et al. 2020.12 Their study indicates more flexible residues, including
several disordered residues within the C-terminus, exist in the ORF10 protein.12 This disagreement
is likely attributed to the method of prediction, as this study used multiple prediction algorithms to
evaluate disorder.12 In doing so, per-residue disorder scores were not over estimated by a single
algorithm; therefore, more conservative but reliable predictions were achieved.25 The data in this
study also indicates mutations in the C-terminus instill changes in residue flexibility; however, these
changes did not result in shifts towards complete disorder. Conversely, mutations in the N-terminus
caused minimal differences in residue flexibility, but as noted in the C-terminus, these did not result
in shifts towards complete disorder. Overall, the forty-one mutations analyzed in this study do not
pose significant changes on the average disorder for the ORF10 protein in SARS-CoV-2.
An overwhelming number of missense mutations in the ORF10 protein decrease protein
stability; however they do not result in a completely unstable protein according to the instability
and aliphatic indices as determined by ProtParam. As such, these mutations are not likely to have
major effects on structure or function; however, Hassan et al. 2020 does assert that some mutations

13

are deleterious and may decrease the protein’s structural integrity.12 Modeling of these mutations
could help determine if they would negatively impact structure of the ORF10 protein.
The ORF10 protein in SARS-CoV-2 might be a membrane protein. Whether this protein is
integrated within or peripheral to the membrane remains unclear, but given the extent of nonpolar
residues it is reasonable to consider this protein as integrated. Furthermore, the TM predictions
suggest residues 3-19 span the membrane with the N-terminus exposed to the extracellular space
or, if within an organelle, the cytoplasmic space. With additional evidence coming from ProFunc
and the hydrophobicity plot, it appears residues 3-19 might compose a TM region in the ORF10
protein. Residues 28-36 might be another TM region; however, TMPred did not implicate these
residues. Scores for those residues in the hydrophobicity plot were also closer to the threshold.
In particular, CoVs encode multiple viroporins.43 For example, in SARS-CoV the 8a
protein oligomerizes to form ion channels inside mitochondrial membranes that induce apoptosis
by depolarizing membrane potential.14,43-45 The ORF10 protein in SARS-CoV-2 may oligomerize
in such a way that polar and electrically charged residues coat the inside of a pore that facilitates
the transport of ions or small molecules for viral replication, virulence, and/or pathogenicity. Based
on the ORF10 protein model, it consists almost entirely of one β-α-β motif. Furthermore, these
motifs are usually found in proteins associated with porins. A prior study found the ORF10 protein
colocalized with accessory proteins 7b and 8 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER); however, its role
in the ER was not described.46 In this case, the ORF10 protein could associate with ER membranes
as a means to assist in viral replication and/or processing of other viral proteins. Experimental work
is necessary to further evaluate this finding. Alternatively, the ORF10 protein could interact with
another protein. As previously stated, the ORF10 protein was suggested to associate with the

substrate adapter ZYG11B.13 This interaction is likely mediated by residues in the N-terminal half
on account of the β-MoRF and high protein-binding propensity scores occurring throughout
residues 1-14. Altogether, it is tempting to think the ORF10 protein may be multifunctional;
however, further studies are necessary to explore this idea.
A major limitation to this study is the quality of sequences due to the varying methods used
to acquire them. Although unlikely, there is always the possibility of errors and missing information
that may affect the results obtained herein. In addition, with only six sequences used, the evidence
of positive selection should not be regarded as conclusive but as additional support for
the hypothesis that positive selection is acting on the SARS-CoV-2 lineage for ORF10. Additional
sequences of good quality from other closely related CoVs can help to resolve this matter. It is also
important to note that mutations analyzed in this study are likely present in other geographic
locations; therefore, the list of locations in this study should not be viewed as exhaustive.
Overexpression of ORF10 has been shown to occur in severe cases of COVID-19 whereas
in milder cases its expression seems to be minimal.16 Therefore, knowing the structure and
biochemical characteristics associated with the ORF10 protein might aid in developing diagnostic
tests that detect for the ORF10 protein, thereby helping to determine the likely progression the
disease may take in patients.16 In addition, based on results by DoGSiteScorer the ORF10 protein
would not make for a suitable drug target. Despite not serving as a likely drug target, the predicted
structure for the ORF10 protein may be useful in further computational analyses detailing events in
viral pathogenesis or virulence. Hopefully, this study can also provide a foundation that drives
further work assessing the biological relevance of ORF10 and its putatively encoded protein
in SARS-CoV-2, thereby aiding in diagnostic and possibly vaccine development.

Table 2. Forty-one ORF10 protein variants from SARS-CoV-2, along with their location, corresponding mutations, and predicted
structural and biochemical effects. NP - Nonpolar; P - Polar.

Figure 1. (A) Phylogenetic analysis of ORF10 sequences. The SARS-CoV lineage has branches shown in red whereas
the SARS-CoV-2 lineage has branches shown in blue. Their corresponding dN/dS ratios calculated by SLAC are also shown. The
phylogeny was inferred using the Jukes-Cantor method. The sum of branch lengths was 0.192 and the tree was produced out
of 1,000 replicates. The bootstrap values are not shown. (B) Screen capture of the MUSCLE alignment for ORF10 proteins in
the SARS-CoV-2 lineage. Conserved positions are indicated with an asterisk. (C) Wu-Kabat plot highlighting amino acid variations
found in the ORF10 protein taken from the SARS-CoV-2 lineage. The consensus sequence was utilized as the reference sequence in
generating this plot.

Figure 2. Per-residue disorder plot for the ORF10 protein in SARS-CoV-2, along with twenty-two variants. Scores ≥ 0.5 indicate
disorder whereas scores between 0.25 and 0.5 indicate highly flexible residues. Any score that exists between 0.1 and 0.25 suggests
moderate flexibility. Scores ≤ 0.1 indicate rigidity.

Figure 3. (A) Hydrophobicity plot for the SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 protein. In generating this plot, scores were normalized on
a 0-1 scale and a 5-residue window was used. The red line displays the threshold where values above this line indicate
hydrophobic regions and values below this line indicate hydrophilic regions. Residues 1-2 and 37-38 are not shown on this
plot. (B) Protein-binding propensity scores for amino acids within the SARS-CoV-2 ORF10 protein. The value of each score
is shown above its corresponding box. As a general rule, a higher score reflects an increased likelihood that a specific
residue is going to engage in a protein-binding interaction.

location of the pocket identified by DoGSiteScorer (yellow). (C) Electrostatic surface map of the ORF10 protein. Red indicates
regions having negative charge whereas blue indicates regions having positive charge. White indicates regions having neutral
charge. (D) Hydrophobicity surface map of the ORF10 protein. Blue indicates regions of hydrophilic character and orange-red
indicates regions of hydrophobic character. White indicates regions of amphipathic character.
