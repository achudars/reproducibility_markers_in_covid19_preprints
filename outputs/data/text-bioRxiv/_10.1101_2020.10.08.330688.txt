Abstract
Characterization of the T cell response in individuals who recover from SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical to
understanding its contribution to protective immunity. A multiplexed peptide-MHC tetramer approach was
used to screen 408 SARS-CoV-2 candidate epitopes for CD8+ T cell recognition in a cross-sectional
sample of 30 COVID-19 convalescent individuals. T cells were evaluated using a 28-marker phenotypic
panel, and findings were modelled against time from diagnosis, humoral and inflammatory responses. 132
distinct SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitope responses across six different HLAs were detected,
corresponding to 52 unique reactivities. T cell responses were directed against several structural and nonstructural virus proteins. Modelling demonstrated a coordinated and dynamic immune response
characterized by a decrease in inflammation, increase in neutralizing antibody titer, and differentiation of a
specific CD8+ T cell response. Overall, T cells exhibited distinct differentiation into stem-cell and
transitional memory states, subsets, which may be key to developing durable protection.

Introduction
The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly evolved
into a global pandemic. To date, over 35 million cases spanning 188 countries or territories have been
reported with more than one million deaths attributed to coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The clinical
spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection is highly variable, spanning from asymptomatic or subclinical infection,
to severe or fatal disease

1,2

. Characterization of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed

in order to better inform more effective treatment strategies, including antivirals and rationally designed
vaccines.

Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to be heterogenous, whereby male sex, advanced
age and hospitalization status are associated with higher titers of antibodies 3. Low or even undetectable
neutralizing antibodies in some individuals with rapid decline in circulating antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 after
resolution of symptoms underscores the need to assess the role of the cellular immune response 4.
Multiple studies suggest that T cells are important in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2, and may
mediate long-term protection against the virus

5–9

.

To date, studies that have evaluated SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in convalescent individuals have focused
on either characterization of responses to selected, well-defined SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, or broad
assessment of T cell reactivity against overlapping peptide libraries

6–10

. The assessment of the complete

SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cell pool in the circulation remains challenging, and there is still much to be learned
from capturing both the breadth (number of epitopes recognized) and depth of T cell response
(comprehensive phenotype) to natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. A study by Peng et al. indicated that the
majority of those who recover from COVID-19 exhibit robust and broad SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell
responses 8. Further, those who manifest mild symptoms displayed a greater proportion of polyfunctional
CD8+ T cell responses compared with severely diseased cases, suggesting a role of CD8+ T cells in
ameliorating disease severity.

Many current COVID-19 vaccine candidates primarily incorporate the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to elicit
humoral immunity

11–13

. However, whether these approaches will induce protection against SARS-CoV-2

infection, or COVID-19 remain unknown. Gaining insight into the immune response that is induced by
natural SARS-CoV-2 infection will be key to advancing vaccine design. Specifically, there is a need to
identify what T cells are targeting in the viral proteome, their functional characteristics, and how these might
correlate with disease outcomes. In this study, our analytical strategy progressed beyond these earlier
findings by identifying dozens of epitopes recognized by CD8+ T cells that spanned different viral proteins
in COVID-19 convalescent subjects, and simultaneously revealed the unmanipulated phenotypic profiles of
these cells. These new findings can be exploited to further guide epitope selection for rationally designed
vaccine candidates and vaccine assessment strategies.

Results
SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell response in COVID-19 convalescent donors is broad and targets
the whole virus proteome
To study the SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T cell repertoire in COVID-19 convalescent donors, a mass
cytometry-based multiplexed tetramer staining approach was employed to identify and characterize (i.e.
phenotype) SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells ex vivo (Figure 1A). A total of 30 convalescent plasma donors
(confirmed by PCR at time of infection) with HLA-A*01:01, HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A03:01, HLA-A*11:01, HLAA*24:02 and HLA-B*07:02 alleles were evaluated 3. The individuals included 18 males and 12 females
ranging between 19 and 77 years old, and were a median of 42.5 days (interquartile range 37.5-48.0) from
initial diagnosis (Table S1). The population was grouped into tertiles according to their overall anti-SARSCoV-2 IgG titers, based on semi-quantitative ELISA results against SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Table S2).
Additional plasma-derived parameters such as neutralizing antibody titers, inflammatory cytokines and
chemokines were used to associate the cellular SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response with the humoral and
inflammatory response (Figure 1A). There was a strong correlation between the donors’ anti-S IgG levels
and the neutralizing antibody activity (Fig S1A). Levels of some inflammatory mediators were associated
with age, sex, neutralizing antibody activity and neutralizing antibody titers (Fig S1B-D).

Hundreds of candidate epitopes spanning the complete SARS-CoV-2 genome were recently identified as
potential targets for a CD8+ T cell response to SARS-CoV-2

tetramer staining approach was used to screen 408 potential epitopes for recognition by T cell responses
across 6 different HLA alleles: HLA-A*01:01, HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A03:01, HLA-A*11:01, HLA-A*24:02 and
HLA-B*07:02

. In addition, CD8+ T cells were probed for reactivity against up to 20 different SARS-

CoV-2-unrelated control peptides per HLA for each sample (CMV-, EBV-, Influenza-, Adenovirus-, and
MART-1-derived epitopes; Table S3). The detection of bona fide antigen-specific T cells was based on the
assessment of several objective criteria such as signal versus noise, consistency between two technical
replicates, and detection threshold. In this study, an average limit of detection of 0.0024% (bootstrapping
confidence interval of 0.0017 and 0.005 under a confidence level of 95%) was achieved for antigen-specific
T cells. Depending on the individual’s HLA allele repertoire, between 48 and 220 peptides were
simultaneously screened per participant.

Figure 1B shows an example of the identification of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in a COVID-19
convalescent donor screened for a total of 145 SARS-CoV-2 antigen candidates and 32 common (SARSCoV-2 unrelated) control antigens across two HLA alleles. CD8+ T cells reactive to six different SARSCoV-2 epitopes and eight control antigens were detected, including peptides derived from Influenza (FLU),
Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), and Cytomegalovirus (CMV). In parallel, commercially obtained healthy donor
PBMCs were run and similar common virus antigen specificities were identified. Notably, SARS-CoV-2
specific CD8+ T cells were not detected in any of the healthy donors recruited before the official SARSCoV-2 pandemic (n=4).

Amongst all 408 SARS-CoV-2 peptide candidates tested, 52 unique peptide reactivities (hits) were
detected which were distributed across a total of 132 SARS-CoV-2 peptide epitopes (Fig. 2A). Almost all
individuals screened demonstrated a CD8+ T cell response against SARS-CoV-2 (29/30), and individual
hits ranged from 0 to 13 with >40% of all individuals showing more than five different SARS-CoV-2
specificities. The frequency of these cells ranged from 0.001% to 0.471% of total CD8+ T cells (Table S4).
In addition, a total of 130 T cell hits against common control peptides were detected in these donor
samples (0.001%.to 1.074% of total CD8+ T cells) (Table S4). Interestingly, the majority of unique T cell
hits were directed against epitopes associated with non-structural proteins such as nsp, PLP and ORF3a
(Fig 2B). Of all the hits that were detected in the cross-sectional sample, the most common reactivities
were against spike (structural, 23.02%) and ORF3a (non-structural, 19.42%). By contrast, nucleocapsid-

specific CD8+ T cells had significantly higher frequencies as compared to spike- or non-structural proteinspecific T cells (Fig. 2C). The total number of recognized epitopes was distributed differently across the
individual HLA alleles that were tested (Fig 2D and Fig S2), whereby T cell responses were identified
against six to 14 different epitopes per allele (Fig 2E). For the purpose of the study, events detected in at
least three donor samples or in more than 35% of donors for each allele group were defined as SARS-CoV2 high-prevalence epitope hit responses.

Based on these criteria, at least two peptides per HLA allele were defined as high-prevalence response hits
(Fig 2E). Of note, the frequencies of high-prevalence SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were significantly higher
as compared to their low-prevalence counterparts (Fig 2F). Frequencies of high-prevalence SARS-CoV-2specific T cells were similar to those of FLU-specific T cells detected in the same cross-sectional sample,
but significantly lower than frequencies of T cells reactive for EBV or CMV peptides (Fig 2F). In summary,
these data show a reliable detection of multiple SARS-CoV-2 T cell hits and indicate a broad recognition of
epitopes by CD8+ T cell responses against the SARS-CoV-2 proteome during recovery from COVID-19.

SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells exhibit a unique phenotype and can be classified into different
memory subsets
Our multiplexed tetramer staining approach enables deep phenotypic characterization of antigen-specific T
cells. By using a panel comprising 28 markers that were dedicated to T cell identification and profiling,
including several markers indicative of T cell differentiation (Table S5), the phenotypic profiles of all SARSCoV-2-specific T cells detected in this cross-sectional sample were further analysed.

To compare the phenotypes of antigen-specific T cells targeting different SARS-CoV-2 proteins, the
frequencies of T cells expressing all markers were determined (Fig 3A). Despite some phenotypic
heterogeneity, the majority of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells grouped together and were distinct from T cells
that were specific for CMV-, EBV-, or FLU-derived epitopes detected in the same samples; the same
outcome was reached when displaying the data as a two-dimensional UMAP plot (Fig 3B). SARS-CoV-2
specific T cells showed an intermediate phenotype between MART-1-specific T cells, which are
predominantly naïve (CCR7 high and CD45RA high), and memory FLU-specific T cells 18.

An early differentiated memory phenotype has recently been described for SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells 9.
SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were separated into subpopulations based on the stages of T cell
differentiation, further split into high- and low-prevalence response hits as earlier defined, and their
frequencies compared with one another, as well as with total CD8+ T cells. Likewise, these were compared
with the differentiation profiles of T cells reactive against common virus antigens and MART-1. The
classification into functionally different T cell subsets following antigen encounter is based on the
expression of different marker combinations, which describe a progressive T cell differentiation and allow to
delineate a dynamic transition between memory and effector cell function

19

(Fig 3C and S3). When

compared to the total CD8+ T cell population, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were significantly enriched for
cells with stem-cell memory (SCM) and transitional memory cells 2 (TM2) phenotypes. More specifically,
high-prevalence SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were skewed toward a phenotype that is typical of terminal
effector memory cells re-expressing CD45RA (TEMRA), effector memory cells (EM) and TM2 cells, while
their low-prevalence counterparts were enriched with SCM and central memory (CM) cells. In contrast,
MART-1-specific T cells were naïve, FLU-specific T cells were predominantly of a TM2 phenotype, EBVspecific T cells were largely characterized by TM1 and CM phenotypes, and CMV-specific T cells were
more differentiated as reflected by a strong effector component.

Expansion of highly differentiated SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells in convalescent donors
To gain further insight into the phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells, the expression of all the
phenotypic markers were compared between T cells exhibiting high- with those exhibiting low-prevalence
epitope responses. Similar to our findings in the total pool of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells, a
heterogenous marker expression was detected across these cells, but no specific clustering with respect to
the epitope response prevalence (Fig S4A). To further compare the phenotypes of T cells from high- vs.
low-prevalence epitope response categories, the high-dimensionality of the dataset was reduced and the
phenotypic information plotted from Figure S4A using principal component analysis (PCA) (Fig S4B). The
PCA displayed a skewing of high-prevalence SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells towards late T cell differentiation
(CD57 and CD161), in contrast to the low-prevalence response hits characterized by early differentiation
markers (CD27, CD28, CCR7). In order to quantify this spatial distribution, the individual expression of all
markers was evaluated and the frequencies for each marker compared between the high- and lowprevalence response hits. Significantly higher frequencies of T cells expressing CD57 and Granzyme B

were detected amongst high-prevalence SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, while the frequencies of CCR7expressing cells were substantially higher amongst the low-prevalence hit responses (Fig 4A). These
findings were further confirmed when overlaying the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells on a two-dimensional
UMAP plot created based on the full phenotypic panel (Fig 4B). The majority of T cells that had been
categorized as high-prevalence response hits were associated with the expression of CD57 and Granzyme
B, while their low-frequency counterparts detected in the same donors were characterized by a high CCR7
expression.

High-prevalence SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detected at a higher frequency (Fig 2F) as compared to
their low-prevalence counterparts. Therefore, assessment of the magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T
cell response was also correlated with their phenotypes. Interestingly, a negative correlation between the
frequency of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T cells and the expression of markers associated with early T cell
differentiation was observed (CD28, CCR7, CD127, CD27, CD38, and CXCR3) (Fig. 4C and 4D). In
contrast, the level of expression of markers that are associated with late stage T cell differentiation (CD244,
CD57, Granzyme B, and KLRG1) correlated positively with increasing frequencies of SARS-CoV-2 specific
CD8+ T cells.

Time-dependent evolution of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell response, inflammation and humoral
immune response
To examine the relationship between inflammation, humoral immunity, and the T cell response, the
frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells were evaluated against their IgG to Spike titer and
neutralizing antibody activity (measured by NT AUC) (Fig 5A). Interestingly, although the phenotypic
clustering of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells was not associated with IgG titer tertiles (Fig S4A), NT
AUC correlated negatively with expression of markers associated with an immature or early differentiated
phenotype (CCR7, CD28, CD45RA, CD127, CXCR3), while correlating positively with CD57 and CD161
(Fig 5A-B). Next, assessment of the association between inflammatory molecules and SARS-CoV-2specific T cells was conducted. Inflammation can indirectly regulate the persistence of antigen-specific T
cells in the absence of TCR stimulation or during chronic infection by modulating the homeostatic cytokine
profile

20,21

. Overall, the correlation between inflammatory mediators and the expression of individual

markers on SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, or the T cell frequency, remained weak (Fig 5A). Finally, the

evolution of the SARS-CoV-2-directed T cell response against time based on the last detection of SARSCoV-2 specific mRNA was modeled in each donor (Table S1). Interestingly, an increase in the breadth of
the specific CD8+ T cell response was observed during the resolution phase of the disease, peaking at
approximately six weeks (Fig S5). Longer recovery time was associated with higher frequencies of cells
expressing markers of terminal T cell differentiation (CD57, CD244 and KLRG-1) and activation (HLA-DR),
indicating a positive correlation between recovery time and T cell maturation (Fig 5A and 5C). Plasma
levels of several cytokines (IL-18, TARC, MCP-1, VEGF) also decreased over time suggesting a negative
correlation between recovery time and inflammation (Fig S1A).
These data suggest that during early recovery from COVID-19, an overall, time-dependent decrease in
inflammation is associated with sustained and effective antibody neutralizing activity with progressive
differentiation of a broad and functional SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell response (Fig S6).

Discussion
An improved understanding of natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is needed to advance development of
prevention strategies and/or treatment options for COVID-19. Recent findings suggest that T cells confer
protection, whereby virus-specific memory T cell responses have been demonstrated in the majority of
those who recover from COVID-19 even in the absence of detectable circulating antibodies 9. Moreover,
the detection of T cells that are specific for the original SARS-CoV nucleoprotein in patients years after
infection highlights the potential role of T cells in generating long lasting immunity against the virus 7. A
mass cytometry based peptide-MHC-tetramer staining strategy

17

was applied, whereby 408 SARS-CoV-2

candidate epitopes were screened spanning 6 different HLA alleles. This enabled an ex vivo identification
and true phenotypic characterization of virus-specific T cells in COVID-19 convalescent individuals without
an in-vitro culture or stimulation bias which could affect the cellular phenotype, in contrast to prior studies
using overlapping peptide pools

6–8

. The high detection rate of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells across

these COVID-19 convalescent donors is consistent with previous reports

6–8

. In addition to the detection of

epitopes previously described by others, over a third (i.e. 35%) of the antigen-specific T cells identified here
have not been previously reported (Table S6), thereby highlighting the sensitivity of the adopted screening
approach

8,9,22–27

. However, given the low frequencies of many of these CD8 T+ cells, it is possible that

these were below the detection threshold since T cell counts are very low in acutely infected patient
samples

28

. The T cell response in our study was directed against the full SARS-CoV-2 proteome with the

majority of CD8+ T cells targeting epitopes derived from internal and/or non-structural virus proteins, which
is in agreement with the recent findings by others 8. Moreover, half of the high-prevalence response hits
identified for each HLA comprised antigens derived from non-structural proteins. In total, 12 highlyprevalent SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T cell responses were identified, several of which overlapped with
the immunodominant peptides detected by others 8, while some differed by the HLA type or the viral
proteins that were assessed. The overall breadth and magnitude of the SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell
response may depend on the viral load, the severity of the disease and the intensity of the priming during
the acute phase of the disease. Therefore, our collective findings support inclusion of a broad repertoire of
SARS-CoV-2 epitopes in future vaccine designs 8.A unique phenotype for SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells was
observed that was distinct from other common virus-specific T cells detected in the same cross-sectional
sample. In particular, an enrichment in cells with a stem-cell and transitional memory phenotype was
observed as compared to total and other virus-specific T cells. The inclusion of CD27, CD28 and CD95 in
the evaluation of T cell differentiation states facilitates a granular characterization of T cell progression and
reveals memory and effector capabilities of these cells. In addition, we observed a broad expression of
CD127 across all hits detected, inferring proliferative functionality. A similar early differentiated memory
phenotype has recently been described for SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, and was further characterized by
polyfunctionality and proliferative capacity

9,29

. The potential of TSCM to differentiate into various T cell

memory subsets might contribute to durable protection against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 convalescent
donors. However, Kared et al., recently showed that an alteration in the Wnt signaling affects the
differentiation capabilities of TSCM in older patients 30.
In the current study, no significant impact of age was observed on the quantity or quality of SARS-CoV-2specific T cells. The potential role of TSCM in SARS-CoV-2 immune protection remains to be assessed in
larger cohorts with longitudinal follow-up studies. Higher T cell frequencies were observed in highprevalence epitope responses, and an increased expression of late differentiation markers (CD57,
Granzyme B) vs. early differentiation markers (CCR7) was observed in high- versus low-prevalence epitope
responses, respectively. Overall, the increased expression of markers associated with T cell differentiation
correlated with the frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells detected in this cross-sectional sample. The

evolving profiles of epitope-specific responses during the resolution phase of the disease suggest a
continuous proliferation and dynamic differentiation of TSCM into effector memory CD8+ T cells. Previous
studies described an activated phenotype across SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells during acute COVID-19
infection 9, which was not consistently observed in our cross-sectional sample. The quiescent phenotype
observed in our study may be a consequence of down-regulated activation after viral clearance,
homeostatic proliferation associated with the resolution of inflammation, or a combination of both. Indeed,
while there was a decrease in inflammation in this cross-sectional sample over time, the expansion and
progressive differentiation of a broad and functional SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response correlated with
the neutralizing antibody activity and donor recovery time. Our findings bring new insights into the viral
targets and dynamics of the SARS-COV-2-specific CD8+ T cell response. Nevertheless, it remains to be
investigated whether a T cell response to a broad diversity of epitopes is relevant at the early and acute
stages of the disease, and whether they have a protective role at the primary site of infection, as observed
in influenza virus induced respiratory disease

31

. Likewise, it will be important to better understand the

phenotypic kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells and their contribution to long-term protection.
This study has limitations. Foremost is the relatively small sample size. The need to generate a well
characterized sample set, limited the number of subjects that could be included. Second, the study is
confined to a sampling of COVID-19 convalescent individuals from the greater Baltimore/Washington DC
area. As such, this is a geographically restricted population and may not be broadly representative. Third, a
low proportion of those who were evaluated had been hospitalized. While this limited our ability to
investigate T cell responses in those who were severely ill, it has afforded insight into those with milder
disease, which is a more commonly encountered form of COVID-19 and could alternatively be considered a
strength of our study. Fourth, while the HLA types which were included account for ~73% of the continental
US population, the technology was restricted to only six HLA types. Lastly, the study was cross-sectional
and restricted to a relatively narrow time period. Specifically, individuals were evaluated 27-62 days postsymptom resolution. At a minimum, they needed to be at least 28 days post-resolution to donate samples.
This limits the conclusions with respect to earlier and/or later in the convalescent period. Of note, even
within the period that was evaluated, changes in the T cell and cytokine responses were observed over
time. For example, those later in the convalescent period exhibited T cell maturation with effector cells

remaining, possibly to clear residual infection. This is consistent with the cytokine data, demonstrating a
time effect since diagnosis.
To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive and precise characterization of SARS-CoV-2-specific
CD8+ T cell epitope recognition and corresponding ex vivo T cell phenotypes in COVID-19 convalescent
subjects to date. The discovery of hitherto undescribed SARS-CoV-2 T cell specificities, their unbiased
phenotypic evaluation, and their correlation with the overall inflammation greatly extends the current
understanding about natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Knowing the combination of epitope targets and T
cell profiles capable of differentiating into long-term mediators of protection may be pivotal for triggering a
durable immune response. Based on these findings, it seems prudent to include several internal and nonstructural viral proteins in the rational design of a second-generation multivalent vaccine.

Methods
Sample selection, antibody titers, HLA typing and cytokine testing
The study samples were collected from individuals who were at least 18 years old, who had recovered from
COVID-19, and expressed a willingness to donate COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP). In order to
qualify for CCP donation, individuals had to have a history of COVID-19 as confirmed by a molecular test
(e.g. nasopharyngeal swab) for SARS-CoV-2 and meet all eligibility criteria for community blood donation
(e.g. not having been pregnant within the six weeks prior to donation, no history or socio-behavioural risk
factors for the major transfusion transmissible infections e.g. HIV, hepatitis B and C) 3. Eligible individuals
were enrolled in the study under full, written informed consent, after which whole blood (25 mL) samples
were collected. The samples were separated into plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
within 12 hours of blood collection. Aliquots of plasma and PBMC were stored at -80˚C until further
processing.

A subset of convalescent individuals was selected for evaluating SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T cells using
highly multiplexed mass cytometry. Among the first 118 eligible CCP donors, there were 87 individuals with
at least four vials of PBMCs collected (each vial contains at least 5 million PBMCs). These individuals were
grouped into tertiles (high, medium and low IgG titers) according to overall anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers
based on EuroImmun ELISA results against SARS-CoV-2

(Table S2). Fifteen individuals were randomly

selected from each tertile for HLA typing using the donor PMBC samples. HLA-A and -B loci were tested
from genomic DNA by next generation sequencing using the TruSight HLA v1 Sequencing Panel,
CareDx®, South San Francisco, CA. Individuals matched for ≥2 HLA-A or B alleles (HLA-A*01:01, HLAA*02:01, HLA-A*03:01, HLA-A*11:01, HLA-A*24:02 and HLA-B*07:02) were included in the subsequent
analyses. The remainder of individuals matched for one HLA-A or B allele were randomly selected so that
each tertile group comprised ten different donors (total n=30).

The 30 donor samples were transferred to ImmunoScape from JHU in the form of cryopreserved PBMCs.
Each sample consisted of either one or two aliquots with an average cell number of 12.15 million cells and
a viability above 95% per donor. Samples were thawed at 37°C and immediately transferred into complete
RPMI medium (10% hiFCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine, 10mM HEPES, 55µM 2-mercaptoethanol
(2-ME) supplemented with 50 U/ml Benzonase (Sigma). Aliquots derived from the same donors were
combined and all samples were enriched for T cells by removing CD14 and CD19 expressing cells using a
column-based magnetic depletion approach according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Miltenyi).
Healthy donor PBMCs (STEMCELL) matched for at least one of the donor HLA alleles were included in
each experiment as control for specific T cell identification.

SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (nAbs) titers against 100 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50)
per 100 uL were determined using a microneutralization (NT) assay, as previously described 3. The nAb
titer was calculated as the highest plasma dilution that prevented cytopathic effect (CPE) in 50% of the
wells tested. nAb area under the curve (AUC) values were estimated using the exact number of wells
protected from infection at every plasma dilution.

Highly sensitive, multiplexed sandwich immunoassays using MULTI-ARRAY® electrochemiluminescence
detection technology (MesoScale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) were used
for the quantitative evaluation of 35 different human cytokines and chemokines in plasma samples from
eligible CCP donors [IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, TNF-α, GM-CSF, IL-1α, IL-5,
IL-7, IL-12/IL23p40, IL-15, IL-16, IL-17A, TNF-β, VEGF-A, Eotaxin, MIP-1β, Eotaxin-3, TARC, IP-10, MIP1α, MCP-1, MDC, MCP-4, IL-18, IL-1RA, G-CSF (CSF3), IFN-α2a, IL-33 and IL-21]. Cytokine and
chemokine concentrations were calculated per manufacturer protocol (MSD DISCOVERY WORKBENCH®

analysis software) and were considered “detectable” if both runs of each sample had a signal greater than
the analyte- and plate-specific lower limit of detection (LLOD) (i.e., 2.5 standard deviations of the platespecific blank). Cytokine and chemokine concentrations (pg/mL) from both runs of each analyte were
averaged.

Peptides
A total of 408 unique SARS-CoV2 candidate peptide epitopes spanning six HLAs (HLA-A*01:01, HLAA*02:01, HLA-A*03:01, HLA-A*11:01, HLA-A*24:02 and HLA-B*07:02) were selected based on recent
predictions

14,15

(Table S3). For each of the HLA alleles tested, up to 20 different control peptides (SARS-

CoV-2 unrelated epitopes) were also included into the screenings (Table S3). All peptides were ordered
from Genscript (China) or Mimotopes, (Australia) with a purity above 85% by HPLC purification and mass
spectrometry. Lyophilized peptides were reconstituted at a stock concentration of 10 mM in DMSO.

Antibody staining panel setup
Purified antibodies lacking carrier proteins (100 μg/antibody) were conjugated to DN3 MAXPAR chelating
polymers loaded with heavy metal isotopes following the recommended labelling procedure (Fluidigm). A
specific staining panel was set up consisting of 28 antibodies addressing lineage, phenotypic and functional
markers (Table S5). All labelled antibodies were titrated and tested by assessing relative marker
expression intensities on relevant immune cell subsets in PBMCs from healthy donors (STEMCELL).
Antibody mixtures were prepared freshly and filtered using a 0.1 mM filter (Millipore) before staining.

Tetramer multiplexing setup
To screen for SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells we set up a three-metal combinatorial tetramer staining
approach as described previously 17,32. Briefly, specific peptide-MHC class I complexes were generated by
incubating biotinylated UV-cleavable peptide HLA monomers in the presence of individual antigen
candidates. For the generation of a triple-coded tetramer staining mixture recombinant streptavidin was
conjugated to heavy metal loaded DN3 polymers

17

and three out of 12 differently labelled streptavidin

molecules were randomly combined by using an automated pipetting device (TECAN) resulting in a total of
220 unique possible combinations to encode single peptide candidates. Peptide exchange was performed
at 100μg/mL of HLA monomer in PBS with 50μM peptides of interest in a 96-well plate. Peptides with

similar sequences were assigned the same triple code to avoid multiple signals through potential T cell
cross-reactivity. According to the donors’ HLA genotypes, total epitope screenings ranged from 49 to 220
peptides for individual samples, including SARS-CoV-2 unrelated control peptides. For tetramerization,
each triple coded streptavidin mixture was added in three steps to their corresponding exchanged peptide–
MHC complexes to reach a final molar ratio of 1:4 (total streptavidin:peptide–MHC). The tetramerized
peptide–MHC complexes were incubated with 10μM of free biotin (SIGMA) to saturate remaining unbound
streptavidins. All tetramers were combined and concentrated (10 kDa cutoff filter) in cytometry buffer (PBS,
2% fetal calf serum, 2 mM EDTA, 0.05% sodium azide) before staining the cells. As internal control and to
facilitate the detection of bona fide antigen-specific T cells we generated a second tetramer staining
configuration for each experiment using a completely different coding scheme for each peptide 17.

Sample staining and acquisition
T cell enriched donor samples and healthy donor PBMCs were split into two fractions and seeded at equal
numbers in two wells of a 96 well plate. Cells were washed and each well was then stained with 100ul of
either one of the two tetramer configurations for 1h at RT. After 30 mins a unique metal (Cd-111 and Cd113) labelled anti-CD45 antibody was added into each of the wells to further barcode the cells that were
stained with the different tetramer configurations. Cells were then washed twice and the two wells per
sample were combined and stained with the heavy metal labelled antibody mixtures for 30 mins on ice and
200 μM cisplatin during the last 5 mins for the discrimination of live and dead cells. Cells were washed and
fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4°C. For intracellular staining, cells were incubated in 1x
permeabilization buffer (Biolegend) for 5 min on ice and incubated with metal conjugated anti-GranzymeB
antibodies for 30 min on ice. Samples from different donors were barcoded with a unique dual combination
of bromoacetamidobenzyl-EDTA (Dojindo)-linked metal barcodes (Pd-102, Pd-104, PD106 and PD108,
and Pd-110) for 30 min on ice. Cells were then washed and resuspended in 250 nM iridium DNA
intercalator (Fuidigm) in 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS at RT. Cells were washed, pooled together and
adjusted to 0.5 million cells per ml H2O together with 1% equilibration beads (EQ Four element calibration
beads, Fluidigm) for acquisition on a HELIOS mass cytometer (CyTOF, Fluidigm).

After mass cytometry acquisition, signals for each parameter were normalized based on EQ beads
(Fluidigm) added to each sample

33

and any zero values were randomized using a custom Rscript that

uniformly distributes values between minus-one and zero. Each sample was manually de-barcoded
followed by gating on live CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (CD45+ DNA+ cisplatin- CD3+ cells) from either staining
configuration after gating out residual monocytes (CD14) and B cells (CD19) using FlowJo (Tree Star Inc)
software. Antigen-specific triple tetramer positive cells (hits) were identified by an automated peptide-MHC
gating method 17 and each hit was confirmed and refined using manual gating. The designation of bona fide
antigen-specific T cells was further dependent on (i) the detection cut-off threshold (≥2 events to be
detected in each staining configuration), (ii) the frequency correspondence between the two tetramer
staining configurations (ratio between the frequencies of a hit in either staining configuration to be ≤2) and
(iii) the background noise (frequencies of specific CD8 T+ cell events must be greater than events from the
corresponding CD4 T cell population), as unbiased objective criteria for antigen-specificity assessment

16

.

Bulk T cells and true hits from both staining configurations were combined for assessing frequencies,
phenotypic and statistical analysis.
Frequency values were calculated based on the percentage of the parent immune cell population.
Phenotypic markers were gated individually for each sample and calculated as % of positive cells. Highdimensional phenotypic profiles and sample distributions were shown using uniform manifold approximation
and projection

and Phenograph for automated cell clustering

. Data analysis was performed using

CYTOGRAPHER®, immunosCAPE’s cloud based analytical software, custom R-scripts, GraphPad Prism
and Flowjo software.

Statistical analysis
Comparative analyses of frequencies of cell subsets and marker expression between samples were done
using Wilcoxon rank sum tests, extended to Kruskall-Wallis tests by ranks for more than 2 levels in a
grouping variable; resulting p-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg
method to control the false discovery rate. Correlations were calculated with the Spearman’s rank-order
test. A correlation matrix was calculated comparing phenotypic and serological marker variables in a
pairwise fashion, using the corr.test function from the psych CRAN package; the corrplot package was
subsequently used to graphically display the correlation matrix. Resulting p-values were adjusted for
multiple testing using the Bonferroni method. Spearman’s correlation coefficients were indicated by a heat

convalescent donors. A) Visualization and schematic overview of the experimental workflow. SARS-CoV2-specific CD8+ T cells were identified and simultaneously characterized in PBMCs from convalescent
donors by screening a total of 408 SARS-CoV-2 candidate epitopes across six HLAs using a mass
cytometry based highly multiplexed tetramer staining approach. Frequencies and phenotypic profiles of
SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were associated and correlated with the cross-sectional sample-specific
humoral response and inflammation parameters. B) Representative staining and screening example for
SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells from a convalescent donor sample. Shown is a screen probing for 145
SARS-CoV-2 candidate antigens (HLA-A02 and HLA01) and 31 SARS-CoV-2 unrelated control antigens.
Healthy donor PBMCs were run in parallel. Red boxes indicate SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell hits. Screening
