Abstract—word count:150
Mink, on a farm with about 15,000 animals, became infected with SARS-CoV-2. Over

25

75% of tested animals were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in throat swabs and 100% of tested

26

animals were seropositive. The virus responsible had a deletion of nucleotides encoding residues

27

H69 and V70 within the spike protein gene. The infected mink recovered and after free-testing of

28

the mink, the animals remained seropositive. During follow-up studies, after a period of more

29

than 2 months without virus detection, over 75% of tested animals scored positive again for

30

SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Whole genome sequencing showed that the virus circulating during this re-

31

infection was most closely related to the virus identified in the first outbreak on this farm but

32

additional sequence changes had occurred. Animals had much higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2

33

antibodies after re-infection than at free-testing. Thus, following recovery from an initial

34

infection, seropositive mink rapidly became susceptible to re-infection by SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

38

The SARS-CoV-2 has caused a pandemic and contributed to the deaths of over 2 million

39

people (1). Farmed mink (Neovison vison) are also highly susceptible to infection by SARS-

40

CoV-2 (2, 3). As in humans, the infection in mink can cause respiratory distress and, in some

41

cases, mortality. However, often the proportion of infected mink that show clinical disease is

42

low. Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in farmed mink were initially observed in the Netherlands

43

(NL), in April 2020 (3), and then independently in Denmark (DK) in June 2020 (note, different

44

clades of the virus were involved, see (2)). Outbreaks have continued and about 70 farms in the

45

NL have been infected (4) while 290 farms out of about 1200 mink farms in DK were positive

for the virus (5). All mink (>15,000,000) have now been culled in DK (6). Similarly, the

47

termination of mink farming in the NL was brought forward by 3 years from the previously

48

planned date of 1st January 2024 (4). The routes of transmission of the virus between mink farms

49

are not fully understood (5) but it has become apparent that spread of the virus can occur not

50

only from humans to mink but also from mink to humans (2, 7).

51

After the initial cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mink in DK, on Farms 1-3 in Northern

52

Jutland (as described in (2)), a regular screening program was established to test dead mink from

53

all Danish mink farms for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, every 3rd week (6). Infection of mink on

54

Farm 4 was identified through this Early Warning (EW) program but, in contrast to Farms 1-3,

55

the mink were not culled and the seropositive animals apparently cleared the infection. This

56

allowed an evaluation of the duration and efficacy of the immune response in mink to protect

57

against re-infection.

Results

59

Infection of mink on Farm 4

60

Farm 4 (with about 2400 adult mink and 12600 kits housed in 24 open sheds), was

61

located near Hjørring (also in Northern Jutland) and was tested as part of the EW screening

62

program. On 20th July 2020, as part of this system, 5 dead mink from this farm were tested for

63

the virus and all were RT-qPCR negative. However, on 11th August, a further 5 dead mink were

64

tested and all were positive in this assay (Table 1). In follow-up testing, on 13th August, 23 of 30

65

live mink tested (16 adults and 14 kits) were positive. A further 7 (of 10) dead mink also tested

66

positive. All live mink tested (30 kits and 30 adults) were also strongly seropositive on 19th

67

August, but a reduced proportion of the mink (13 of these 60 mink tested) were positive for

68

SARS-CoV-2 RNA. However, throat swab samples from 21 dead mink were all positive for viral

69

RNA. Furthermore, on 31st August, 7 out of 24 dead mink also tested positive by RT-qPCR. The

70

mink on the farm were not culled but closely followed and, from 15th September onwards, no

71

virus was detected by RT-qPCR among the mink. For “free-testing”, 300 animals were tested (in

72

60 pools of 5 samples) on 30th September (Table 1) with negative results. This testing strategy

73

was designed to detect, with 95% confidence, a 1% prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive

74

animals. Hence, the infection had apparently disappeared among the mink on this farm.

75

Surveillance of the farm continued and, in early October, 60 live mink were tested and

76

were again all found negative by RT-qPCR but all these mink remained seropositive (Table 1).

77

Thus, no animals tested positive by RT-qPCR in September and October but there was a very

78

high (100%) prevalence of antibodies against anti-SARS-CoV-2. However, unexpectedly, 1 of 2

79

pools of 5 dead mink tested, as part of the continuing EW program, on both 2nd and 4th

80

November were found to be positive by RT-qPCR (Table 1). Consequently, a further 30 animals

81

were tested on 6th November and 23 (77%) were found SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive while 100%

82

of these animals remained seropositive, as observed one month previously. In addition, 3 out of 5

83

additional dead mink were found positive by RT-qPCR. The Ct values for 15 of the 23 samples

84

that were found positive for viral RNA were below 30. No specific clinical signs of respiratory

85

disease were apparent on the farm, however the farmer had noticed reduced feed intake and some

86

cases of diarrhea in the mink.

87

Titration, in the ELISA, of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in seropositive serum

88

samples collected from August onwards showed that much higher levels of these antibodies were

89

present in the mink in November, following the second round of infection than in August or

90

October (see Figure 1A) although the seroprevalence in the mink had been high throughout. In

August, the median antibody titre observed (from 16 animals tested) was 800 (with values

92

ranging from 100 to 3200), with just a single animal having the highest titre. In early October (at

93

free-testing), the titres in 15 sera tested were higher (ranging from 800 to 12800, with 4 of the

94

sera having titres of ≥6400, the median titre was 3200). However, in November, following the

95

reappearance of RT-qPCR positive animals, from 22 sera tested, 16 of them had titres ≥6400 and

96

12 had titres of 25600, see Figure 1A). Thus, it is clear that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody

97

levels, as measured by the ELISA, in the mink were greatly enhanced following the re-infection.

98

It was apparent that in some individual animals no change in antibody levels were apparent in

99

November, presumably because not all the animals had been re-infected.

100

101

Assessment of neutralizing antibodies
To assess whether the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the mink that were detected by

102

ELISA were capable of neutralizing virus infectivity, the same serum samples were also tested in

103

virus neutralization assays using a human SARS-CoV-2 isolate that had the same amino acid

104

changes in the spike protein as the viruses identified initially on Farm 4 (as used previously (8)).

105

The results (see Figure 1B) showed a similar pattern of antibody development as observed in the

106

ELISA. All the ELISA positive sera tested had neutralization activity but the levels of these

107

antibodies were greatly elevated after the second round of infection (sera collected in

108

November). There was a high degree of correspondence between the levels of antibodies

109

detected in the two different types of assay (for all samples, the Spearman correlation co-

110

efficient r= 0.793, p <0.0001).

The complete genome sequences of the viruses, from multiple samples, from infected
mink on Farm 4 in August and in November were determined. The viruses present on Farm 4 in

114

August were all from clade 20B and were very closely related to the viruses that were identified

115

on Farms 1, 2 and 3 (2) (Table 2 and Figure 2) and appeared to be part of the same transmission

116

chain. In particular, they each had the mutation A22920T in the spike protein coding sequence,

117

resulting in the amino acid substitution Y453F, which is a hallmark of most viruses that have

118

infected mink in DK. This change was also detected on farm NB02, one of four farms initially

119

infected in NL, however, this was within a different virus clade (see (2, 3)). However, in

120

addition to this change, the spike protein gene in the viruses on Farm 4 also had a deletion of 6 nt

121

(Δ21766-21771). This deletion affects 3 separate codons, changing GCT.ATA.CAT.GTC.TCT to

122

GCT.ATC.TCT, the encoded amino acid sequence is changed from A-I-H69-V70-S to A-I-S thus

123

residues H69 and V70 in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein are lost. This

124

deletion had not been identified previously in mink or in humans in combination with the Y453F

125

substitution (see Table 2) but the deletion of these residues is shared with the SARS CoV-2

126

variant of concern (VOC) 202012/01 (9). Two other deletions in the ORF1a coding sequence

127

(Δ517-519 and Δ6510-6512) and two other amino acid substitutions (P3395S in ORF1a and

128

S2430I in ORF1b) were also observed in some of the viruses present in the mink during this

129

initial infection in August. The viruses present on Farm 4 in November were most closely

130

related to those seen previously on Farm 4, over 2 months earlier (Figure 2). It should be noted

131

that, by November 2020, over 200 farms in DK had been identified as having infected mink (5)

132

and a number of different variants had been observed in the animals (6). The viruses on Farms 1-

133

3 were closely related to each other and also to the viruses present in August on Farm 4, but the

134

latter viruses had some additional changes (e.g. the deletion of residues H69 and V70 in the spike

135

protein, see Table 2), which persisted throughout the rest of the outbreaks in farmed mink. Thus,

136

viruses in farms infected after Farm 4 (identified on August 11th) were nearly all derived from

137

those first detected on Farm 4. As indicated above, the November viruses from Farm 4 had the

138

A22920T mutation and the deletions in the S and ORF1a coding sequences. However, the

139

November viruses had additional changes across the genome, both within and outside of the S

140

gene, compared to the viruses in Farms 2 and 3 (Table 2). It is noteworthy that the Farm 4

141

sequences in November had changes at nt 10448 (encoding the substitution P3395S in ORF1a)

142

and 20756 (encoding S2430I in ORF1b) that had only been seen in a subset of the August

143

sequences from Farm 4 (samples Farm4_18_13-08-2020 and Farm4_19_13-08-2020, see Figure

144

2). These changes act as a fingerprint and strongly suggest that it was not an entirely new

145

introduction of virus into the farm from elsewhere. Furthermore, the viruses on Farm 4 in

146

November also all shared changes at nt 3792 (resulting in A1176V), 5167, 10887 (resulting in

147

G3541E), 21727 and 23815 (the latter two silent changes are in the S gene) that were not present

148

in any of the Farm 4 sequences in August (Table 2). The presence of these additional sequence

149

changes indicates that the virus had been replicating in hosts with close connection to this farm

150

between August and November but does not prove that the virus has continued to replicate in

151

mink during this time.

152

Phylogenetic analysis clearly showed that all viruses from Farm 4 were very closely

153

related to each other, including the viruses from both August and November (Figure 2). As

154

described above, two of the early Farm 4 viruses (Farm4_18_13-08-2020 and Farm4_19_13-08-

155

2020) shared additional changes at nt 10448 and 20756 (see Table 2) and the November viruses

156

formed their own distinct branch from these (Figure 2), due to the presence of the further

157

sequence changes (Table 2).

SARS-CoV-2 can readily infect humans and mink. In addition, certain other species, e.g.

160

cats, dogs and ferrets, can also be infected following direct inoculation under experimental

161

conditions (10, 11). Furthermore, some cases of transmission from infected people to their cats

162

and dogs have occurred but it does not seem to happen more generally. Both cellular and

163

humoral immune responses occur within SARS-CoV-2-infected people and animals (12, 13) and

164

it is common for both humans and animals to be both seropositive and RT-qPCR positive

165

simultaneously (see (2, 14)). However, as people and animals recover, the levels of virus subside

166

but antibody levels persist, or increase, at least for some time.

167

Farm 4 was the only Danish mink farm, where the animals were allowed to recover and

168

were tested with the purpose of documenting freedom from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, Farm

169

4 gave a unique opportunity to follow the maintenance of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies over an

170

extended period and the resistance of the animals to reinfection. As observed on other mink

171

farms in DK (5), very widespread infection of the mink on Farm 4 by SARS-CoV-2 occurred in

172

the first wave of infection, with 100 % of the tested animals being seropositive. As indicated

173

above, the mink on Farm 4 were not culled after the detection of infection in August but during

174

the following period of over 2 months, the animals were repeatedly screened and found to be

175

negative by RT-qPCR, while the 100% seroprevalence remained. However, in November, it was

176

observed that the mink had become infected again. A high proportion (>75%) of the animals

177

tested had been re-infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1). The virus responsible for the second

178

round of infection was most closely related to the virus found almost 3 months earlier on this

179

farm, with distinctive differences from the viruses responsible for the initial infections observed

180

in mink on Farms 1-3 (2). Notably, specific deletions were present within the spike protein gene

181

and within the ORF1a gene in the virus responsible for the initial infection in August and in the

182

later re-infection (Table 2). The virus acquired additional sequence changes during the period

183

between the infections recognized in August and November, indicative of continued replication,

184

rather than simply having been preserved in an infectious form. Since the virus present on Farm

185

4 in November was most closely related to virus present on the same farm in August, it seems

186

most likely that re-infection of the mink from within the farm had occurred. It cannot be

187

established, however, whether the virus had continued to replicate in a small number of mink on

188

the farm, but with very restricted spread, or if it had replicated in an alternative host, linked to

189

the farm, during this time and had then been re-introduced into the seropositive mink. It has been

190

demonstrated, in both DK and the NL, that transmission between humans and mink can occur in

191

both directions (2, 6). Transmission to, and from, other hosts is theoretically possible (but not

192

described previously; some cats were found to be infected on mink farms in DK and in the NL

193

but they do not seem to spread the virus). It has been found that there was a cluster of

194

occurrences of SARS-CoV-2 with the ΔH69/N70 and Y453F changes (as in Farm 4) in the local

195

human population in August. Furthermore, a virus containing these changes plus the additional

196

mutations (i.e. C3792T, C5167T, G10887A, C21727T and T23815C, see Table 2), which were

197

present in the mink viruses from Farm 4 in November, was found in one person in the first half

198

of November (data not shown). It seems likely that these human cases were infections derived

199

from the mink.

200

A high proportion of the sequence changes observed in mink (see Table 2), which

201

occurred in the viruses from Farm 4 between August and November (and also between the clade

202

20B viruses and the Wuhan virus, see (2)), involved C to T changes (in cDNA) that correspond

203

to C to U changes in the viral RNA. Several of these nt changes are synonymous, i.e., they do not

204

result in amino acid sequence changes. It has been suggested that such changes reflect host

205

immune pressure via RNA editing systems (e.g. by APOBEC) rather than selection for increased

206

transmissibility in particular hosts (15, 16, 17). However, this process of RNA editing is not

207

relevant to the key mutation in the S gene (A22920T), which seems to be an adaptation that

208

occurred during the initial infection of mink (2), or to the generation of deletions. The loss of

209

residues H69 and V70 in the spike protein, seen in mink for the first time on Farm 4, and in

210

certain variants from people, has been reported to double the infectivity of pseudoviruses

211

displaying the mutant spike protein compared to the wild type particles (18).

212

The sampling of the mink on Farm 4 tested, at most, 300 animals on any particular date,

213

out of a population of about 15,000 animals. The free-testing strategy was designed to detect 1%

214

prevalence with high (95%) confidence. It is clearly possible that a small number of infected

215

animals were missed although the repeated follow-up screening makes this unlikely. However,

216

the level of seroprevalence prior to the second round of infection had remained very high (100%)

217

in the animals tested. Thus, it is not clear why so many animals (77% of 30 animals tested) were

218

susceptible to a second round of infection. It has been considered whether the seropositivity

219

detected in kits in August may be a consequence of maternally derived antibodies that could

220

potentially decline more rapidly than antibodies generated from the infection in each animal.

221

However, it seems difficult to reconcile this with the fact that >80% of throat swabs from mink

222

kits tested clearly positive by RT-qPCR in August, which indicated a high level of infection

223

amongst the kits in the first wave also.

224

The measurements of antibody responses were made using an ELISA that targets the

225

receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike

226

protein were present in up to 100% of the infected mink. The antibody titres, measured in this

227

assay, increased to very high levels during the period of re-infection (see Figure 1A). In studies

228

on human sera, samples testing clearly positive (10 x cut-off) in this ELISA all had neutralizing

229

antibodies (19). Indeed, assessment of the same samples of mink sera as tested by ELISA in

230

virus neutralization tests indicated a high correspondence between these two types of assay.

231

Thus, the ELISA positive mink sera neutralized the virus and, furthermore, the sera collected in

232

November, after reinfection, had much higher levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as

measured in each assay (Figure 1B).
It appears that the virus responsible for the infections in November was not antigenically

234

235

distinct from the virus in August since there were no non-synonymous changes within the spike

236

protein gene during this time, although some silent sequence changes (i.e. C21727T and

237

T23815C) had occurred, as well as changes elsewhere, within the virus genome, as usually

238

occurs.

239

The most plausible conclusion is that infection of farmed mink with SARS-CoV-2 does

240

not induce long-term protection against the virus. This should be compared with the situation in

241

rhesus macaques where primary infection did protect against reinfection at about 1 month post-

242

initial infection (13, 20) and in humans where protection from reinfection may last at least eight

243

months (12, 21). However, some cases of re-infection have been reported in health care workers

244

in Brazil (22), although this seems to have occurred in people who only developed a weak

245

immune response during the initial infection. Furthermore, only about 50% of people in DK,

246

who were over 65 years of age and had been infected with SARS-CoV-2, were found to be

247

protected against re-infection (23). On a mink farm, a large number of animals live in close

248

proximity to each other and, potentially, once the infection occurs in some animals then there can

249

be a rapid increase in virus production and a strong challenge to neighbouring animals. Perhaps

250

this is sufficient to overcome the immune response. It is notable that greatly enhanced levels of

251

anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in the mink following the second round of infection

252

(Figure 1), but this was also observed following challenge of previously infected rhesus

253

macaques which did not become re-infected (13, 20). Currently, there are no “correlates of

254

protection” that can be used to evaluate the immune responses in mink.

255

Methods

256

Blood and throat-swab samples were collected from mink (adults and kits) as indicated in

257

Table 1. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was determined by RT-qPCR (2). The SARS-CoV-

258

2 Ab ELISA (Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise, Beijing, China) was performed as

259

described by the manufacturer, with the addition of an extra titration of positive samples.

260

Antibody titres are presented as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of the serum giving a

261

positive result. Neutralising antibody titres were determined as described previously (8). SARS-

262

CoV-2 positive RNA samples were sequenced as described (2) and SARS-CoV-2 sequences

263

were aligned using MAFFT (24). Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the Maximum

264

Likelihood method with the General-Time-Reversible model (25).

1: Note the same additional sequence change was also present in 4 other samples (Farm4_16_13-08-2020, Farm4_20_13-08-2020,
Farm4_22_13-08-2020 and Farm4_4_19-08-2020). N.B. All the mink viruses, together with the EPI_ISL455326 clade 20B representative
sequence, shown here were from clade 20B and had G28881A, G28882A and G28883C changes compared to the Wuhan strain. In addition, the
mink viruses from Farm 4 also lacked nt 517-519 and nt 6510-6512. Other nt changes from the Wuhan reference sequence are highlighted in
yellow while nt changes from the representative clade 20B virus are shown in red type. Shared additional changes that occurred in viruses on
Farm 4 between August and November 2020 are indicated with colour codes, encoded amino acid changes, where applicable, are shown in
parenthesis.
