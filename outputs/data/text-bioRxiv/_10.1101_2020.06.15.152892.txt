Abstract
A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) that initially originates from Wuhan province in
China has emerged as a global pandemic, an outbreak that started at the end of 2019 which claims
431,192 (Date: 15th June 2020 (https://covid19.who.in) life till now. Since then scientists all over
the world are engaged in developing new vaccines, antibodies, or drug molecules to combat this
new threat. Here in this work, we performed an in-silico analysis on the protein-protein interactions
between the receptor-binding (RBD) domain of viral SPIKE protein and human angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor to highlight the key alteration that happened from SARSCoV to SARS-CoV-2. We analyzed and compared the molecular differences between these two
viruses by using various computational approaches such as binding affinity calculations,
computational alanine, and molecular dynamics simulations. The binding affinity calculations
show SARS-CoV-2 binds little more firmly to the hACE2 receptor than that of SARS-CoV.
Analysis of simulation trajectories reveals that enhanced hydrophobic contacts or the van der
Waals interaction play a major role in stabilizing the protein-protein interface. The major finding
obtained from molecular dynamics simulations is that the RBD-ACE2 interface is populated with
water molecules and interacts strongly with both RBD and ACE2 interfacial residues during the
simulation periods. We also emphasize that the interfacial water molecules play a critical role in
binding and maintaining the stability of the RBD/hACE2 complex. The water-mediated hydrogen
bond by the bridge water molecules is crucial for stabilizing the RBD and ACE2 domains. The
structural and dynamical features presented here may serve as a guide for developing new drug
molecules, vaccines, or antibodies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

1. Introduction
The novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) has
emerged as a global pandemic by taking more than 431,192 (Date: 15th June 2020
(https://covid19.who.in) life all over the world. The rapid spread and high mortality rate (3 to
5%)1–3 of this virus pose a serious global health emergency4,5. The general symptoms are
headache, high fever, severe respiratory illness, pneumonia. So far no suitable vaccine or drug
molecule is available to stop this virus from spreading. The new SARS-CoV-2 is characterized
as a new member of the bat coronavirus genome and closely related to the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)4. SARS-CoV is a similar kind of virus that already created
a pandemic in the year 2002. But the magnitude of fatalitity caused by SARS-CoV-2 surpasses
all the previous SARS-like viruses in terms of cost to human life. Both the coronaviruses, SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2, use the homotrimer spike glycoprotein (comprising of S1 and S2
subunit) or SPIKE protein to bind the cellular receptors and induce the dissociation of S1 and S2
subunit. This also triggers a cascade of events such as the transition of S2 from a metastable
prefusion state to a more stable post-fusion state, the fusion between a cell and viral membrane,
etc6–8. S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that binds to the peptidase domain
(PD) of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)9. The recognition of SPIKE protein
with the ACE2 enzyme is the first step of the virus lifecycle and entry to the host cell. These are
the reasons the CoV SPIKE protein is a key target for developing new vaccines, therapeutic
antibodies, and new drug molecules. Recent in vitro studies also indicate that the RBD domain
of the S1 subunit plays a key functional role for the binding of SARS-CoV by ACE210. The
crystal as well as cryo-EM structures of the complexes (SPIKE/hACE2) reveal key information
about the interactions between the RBDs and the hACE2 receptor6,9,11. Superposition of RBD
domains of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 shows very similar structural fold with a root mean
square deviation (RMSD) of 0.68 Å of 139 pairs of Cα atoms12. Knowing that binding to the
ACE2 receptor triggers the virial lifecycle, it is also important to understand how the binding
affinity of SARS-CoV-2 differs from the SARS-CoV. Experimental results reveal that the
binding affinity values for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with hACE2 fall in a similar range12.
Specifically, the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) shows a slightly higher value (15.2 nm)
of SARS-CoV-2 than that of SARS-CoV (15 nM)13. However, a recent publication shows a 203

fold increased binding affinity between trimeric SPIKE protein with ACE2 receptor of SARSCoV-2 than that of SARS-CoV6. Nevertheless, it is now well established that SARS-CoV-2 has
a slightly better binding affinity towards hACE2 than the SARS-CoV. The high binding affinity
suggests that this novel coronavirus is evolved towards being a better binder to the same human
ACE2 receptor. Thus, a comparison of both the RBD domains of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
is of utmost importance and it migh t give us a clue why SARS-CoV-2 is so deadlier than SARSCoV.
Similar to the experiments, several computational studies are performed on the binding affinity
of the RBDs of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with hACE214,15. Most of the earlier results are
based on the homology modeled structure of the SARS-CoV-2, where the global fold of the
SPIKE protein was correct but the atomic level scoring function for predicting the binding
affinity was not accurate. Thus the earlier results predicted lower binding affinity of SARS-CoV214,15. This also implies that the side-chain packing of the modeled structure was not accurate
enough. Recent binding free energy calculations performed on the crystal structure of
RBD/hACE2 of SARS-CoV-2 predicts high binding affinity than SARS-CoV16. Another study
uses Rosetta Interface Analyzer17 and concludes that both these viruses have a similar binding
affinity18. Thus, from in-silico perspective, it is still not fully understood why SARS-CoV-2 is
better binder than SARS-CoV-2 and the results are inconclusive. Hence, atomistic-level
comparison is needed between these two viruses. A recent study found that the hydrogen bonding
network and the hydrophobic interactions are major dominating forces that are responsible for
enhanced binding in SARS-CoV-219. Till now most of the studies focus on the search for new
vaccines and drug molecules against COVID-19. There is very little attention paid to the
atomistic label description and dynamics of the interfacial domain of SPIKE protein with the
hACE2 receptor. The dynamic interactions between the RBD and the hACE2 may reveal some
crucial points that are not accessible from only the crystal structures.
In this work, we first assess the atomistic level description of RBDs of SPIKE protein with
hACE2 receptor from the crystal structures. We identify the key contact residues that are
responsible for the binding of the RBD domain and hACE2. We also critically analyze the
differences in the interfacial residues between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Further the
binding affinity of these two domains of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Next, all-atom molecular
dynamics simulations of RBD domains of SPIKE protein complexed with the human ACE2

receptor of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are performed to extract the dynamics of these
complexes. We focus our study at the interfacial region of RBDs and hACE2 and provide an
atomistic picture of the interactions. The importance of contact residues is also highlighted and
a thorough comparison was made between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Till now, most of
the in-silico work on SPIKE-ACE2 complex is done to design new antibodies or drug molecules,
whereas little attention is paid to the atomistic level description and the dynamics of the SPIKEACE2 complex. Hence, our study focuses on the interfacial region of RBD and ACE2 domains.
Our simulation results reveal that the interfacial water molecules play an important role regarding
the binding of RBDs and ACE2 domain, particularly, the bridge water connecting the two
domains of SPIKE protein and the hACE2.

The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 -RBD/ACE2 (PDB ID: 6VW1) and SARS-CoV-RBD/ACE
(PDB ID: 2AJF) are taken from the protein database and subjected to MD simulations. The two
protein-protein complexes contain some notable structural elements for which special care was
taken while preparing the system, like N-glycosylation of various asparagine residues, disulfide
bridges between various pairs of cysteine, presence of zinc finger and other amino acids which
require proper protonation states. The systems are prepared using the CHARMM-GUI web

server20 and parameter files and equilibration files are taken from the server. All the simulations
were performed using the software GROMACS version 2019.421,22 using the CHARMM-36 forcefield23. Each system is solvated in TIP3P24 water and KCl salt were added to neutralize the systems
to a salt concentration of 150 mM. Each system is solvated in a rectangular box of dimensions
Lx=138 Å, Ly=138 Å, and Lz=138 Å, the distance is appropriate to avoid all finite-size effects due
to long-range electrostatic interactions among neighboring simulation boxes. Simulation for both
the complexes is carried out at 310K and 1 atm pressure. To treat long-range electrostatic
interactions, Particle Mesh Ewald (PME)25 method is used with a cut-off of 12 Å, and to constrain
hydrogen bond, the LINCS algorithm26 was applied. Each system is minimized with 5000 steps of
the steepest descent algorithm to eliminate the bad contacts in the system. After minimization
equilibration simulation is performed for in NVT ensemble at 310 K. After NVT simulation, NPT
equilibration is performed for 5 ns at 1 atm pressure, and the temperature is maintained at 310 K.
During the equilibration period, the position restrained is applied to the heavy atoms of the protein.
Velocity rescale thermostat and Parinnello-Rahman Barostat27 are applied to maintain the
temperature and the pressure respectively. For the protein-protein binding affinity calculations,
FoldX software28 is used. Different visualizing and trajectory analysis software packages UCSF
Chimera29 and VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) 30 were used and QZyme Workbench™31 an
in-house enzyme engineering platform was used for all calculations performed and discussed in
results.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Structure and Energetics Comparison between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
Earlier published results highlighted the differences between the RBD domains of two SPIKE
proteins. The SPIKE protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share 75% sequence similarity
and their structural fold are almost identical. Whereas the RBD domains have a sequence
similarity of 73.7%4. Figure 1 shows the superposition of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and
in the inset, we highlight the key residues that have changed from SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2.
In the crystal structure of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, there are significant protein-protein
contacts that can be seen and we identified some of the key residues that are important for the

stabilization of SPIKE protein and hACE2 receptor. In Figure S1 of Supporting Information,
we displayed the residues that are in the interfacial region of the RBD domain bound to the ACE2
domain. With a distance cut-off 4 Å there are 16 residues of RBD that are in contact with 20
residues of ACE2 domain. A similar analysis of SARS-CoV-2 shows 18 residues of RBD that
are in contact with 21 residues of the ACE2 receptor. Among the 21 ACE2 residues that are
interacting with two RBDs, 17 are found to be common residues. Most of the interacting residues
of the ACE2 receptor are located near the N-terminal helix. The above analysis manifests that
the surface area of the interfacial domain of ACE2 and RBDS is almost the same. This also
corroborates earlier findings where the surface area is 1,687 Å2 and 1,699 Å2 for SARS-CoV-2
and SARS-CoV32. Within this 4 Å cut-off there are 4 hydrophobic residues (Leu455, Phe456,
Ala475, and Phe486) and 14 hydrophilic (i.e. not hydrophobic) residues (Arg408, Thr415,
Tyr449, Tyr453, Gly476, Asn487, Tyr489, Gln493, Gly496, Gln498, Thr500, Asn501, Gly502,
and Tyr505) are there near the interface of SPIKE protein of SARS-CoV-2. Whereas there are 3
hydrophobic residues (Leu443, Leu472, and Ile489) and 13 hydrophilic residues (Arg426,
Tyr436, Tyr440, Tyr442, Asn473, Tyr475, Asn479, Gly482, Tyr484, Thr486, Thr487, Gly488,
Tyr491) are present near the interface of SPIKE protein of SARS-CoV. It is interesting to note
that the interface of RBD domain is enriched with tyrosine and glycine residues for SARS-CoV2 (4 tyrosine and 3 glycine out of 14 residues) as well as SARS-CoV (6 tyrosine and 2 glycine
out of 16 residues). Further, we counted the residues with a cut-off value of 8 Å to get an
estimation of the buried residues of both the RBD domains. We found that 53 and 51 residues
are coming in contact with the ACE2 domain for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 respectively
(Table S1, Supporting Information). To see the effect of the interfacial residues on the overall
binding affinity with hACE2, we performed computational alanine scanning on these interfacial
residues to see the extent of the impact on the binding affinity due to alanine substitution.
Further, the crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 has 13 hydrogen bonds between the RBD domain
and the ACE2 domain. However, SARS-CoV has a lesser number of hydrogen bonds between
the RBD and the ACE2 domain for SARS-CoV. It has only 5 hydrogen bonds between the two
domains. As there are fewer hydrogen bonds in SARS-CoV, we expect that the RBD/ACE2
complex of SARS-CoV-2 is more stable than SARS-CoV. Further, we calculate the binding free
energy of the SPIKE/hACE2 complex from the PRODIGY web server33 as well as from FoldX
software28. The binding free energy is calculated on the crystal structures of the dimer and the

values are -10.8 and -11.7 kcal/mol for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 respectively. While the
FoldX calculations show binding energy -4.49 and -9.87 kcal/mol for SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 respectively. Though the values obtained from PRODIGY and FoldX are not in the same
range, the trend suggests that SARS-CoV-2 binds more effectively to hACE2 and evolved as a
better binder to the human receptor.

3.2 In Silico-Alanine Scanning of Interfacial Residues of RBD Domain
As we discussed in the previous section about the interfacial residues of the RBD domain is
critical for stabilizing the protein-protein complex, we performed computational alanine

represents the space or the interfacial region in bewteen the ACE2 and the RBD domain of the SPIKE
protein.

scanning on the contact residues of the RBD domain to highlight the importance of those
residues. We mutated the interfacial residues to alanine and then calculate the binding free
energy with the ACE2 domain. Alanine scanning is performed to identify the residues that make
a significant contribution to the binding affinity with hACE2. The result reveals that (Figure 3)
most of the residues lower the binding affinity when mutated with alanine except N501 where
a slight increase in binding affinity is observed for SARS-CoV-2. A decrease in binding affinity
suggests that both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have optimized its RBD domain to bind with
the human ACE2 receptor. From the alanine scanning results, we observe that Y449, L455,
8

F486, Y498, G502, and V503 are found to be critical for stabilizing the overall complex.
Compared to SARS-CoV-2, the alanine mutation doesn’t lower the binding affinity for all the
residues of SARS-CoV. This result points to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 optimized its interfacial
residues in such a manner that binding to hACE2 is more enhanced. In this context, we would
like to discuss a few changes that happened between the SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2. Few
mutations like Tyr484→Gln498, Thr487→Asn501, Tyr442→Leu455, Leu443→Phe456,
Leu472→Phe486 Asn479→Gln493 show significant changes in binding affinity when the
particular position is mutated with alanine. It is to be noted that Gln474 and Gly485 inserted
near the interfacial domain of RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Though these two residues are not directly
interacting with the ACE2, they form intramolecular hydrogen bonds two give the stability of
the loop. Like Gln474 interacts with Gly476 and Gly484 interacts with Cys488. The alanine
mutation of these two residues does not change the binding affinity significantly.

scanning is performed on the residues of RBD domain that are coming in contact ACE2 receptor (cutoff value 4.0 Å).

Next section we discuss the results obtained from molecular dynamics simulations.

3.3 Energy components between RBD domains and hACE2 receptor: Hydrophobic
interaction plays a major role
During 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations, both the adducts (SPIKE/hACE2) of SARS-CoV
and SARS-CoV-2 are found to be stable. In Figure S2 of Supporting Information, we have shown
the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of Cα atoms ACE2 and RBD domains of SARS-CoV
and SARS-CoV-2. From the RMSD plots and also visual inspections confirm the SPIKE/hACE2
complexes are fairly stable during the 100 ns simulations. Next section we compare the
interaction energy and binding energy of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2.

From the molecular dynamics simulation trajectories, we extracted different components
of interaction energy i.e. electrostatics and van-der-Waals (vdW) interaction terms between the
RBD of SPIKE protein and the hACE2 receptor. In Figure 4, the probability of different

components of interaction energies are shown between the SPIKE protein and the hACE2
receptor of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The interaction energy plot reveals key features of
how SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 complexes gain stability. Overall, the RBD domain of SARSCoV-2 shows slightly enhance interaction energy with hACE2 than SARS-CoV. The result is in
good agreement with the recently published experimental results where it shows SPIKE protein
on SARS-CoV-2 has a higher binding affinity toward hACE2 than SARS-CoV6. The increased
interaction energy between SARS-CoV-2 is due to an increase in van-der-Waals interactions or
the hydrophobic interactions between the RBD domain and the ACE2 receptor and there is a
small decrease in electrostatic interactions. This also signifies that the substitution in the RBD
domain facilitates the hydrophobic interactions, not the electrostatic interactions. One key
hydrophobic residue Phe486 (Leu472 in SARS-CoV) which placed in a hydrophobic pocket
created by the residues Leu79, Met82, and Tyr83 of hACE2 receptor. In the case of the SARSCoV, the Leu472 is not exactly sitting in between the hydrophobic residues but juts oriented in
outward-facing orientation (Figure S2 of Supporting Information). This also signifies that the
mutation that happened in SARS-CoV-2 increases the protein-protein hydrophobic contacts.
This observation is very important as hydrophobic interaction may lead to a decrease in the
number of water molecules near the receptor-binding domain. Also, it is a very common
phenomenon found in many protein-protein and protein-DNA interfaces that water molecules
play a crucial for stabilizing the binary complexes. A more in-depth analysis is given in Section
3.4 where we discussed the role of interfacial water molecules in RBD/hACE2 complex.

Earlier we computed the binding free energy for the crystal structures where SARS-CoV2 has higher binding energy as compared to the SARS-CoV. Now, we calculate the binding
affinity from simulation trajectories to see how the dynamics of these two domains affect the
binding affinity. From 100 ns trajectory files, we extracted 1000 frames and calculate the binding
free energy. The values that we got are -4.20± 0.62 kcal/ and -3.45±0.51 kcal/mol for SARSCoV-2 and SARS-CoV. The dynamical picture obtained from the simulations signifies that the
binding affinity of these two viruses is almost the same with hACE2 or slightly higher than
SARS-CoV. Compared to the static picture, the dynamic picture indicates, fluctuation of both
RBD and the hACE2 has significance on the overall binding affinity of the protein-protein
interaction.

A key observation that was made from the simulation trajectories is that the minimum
distance between the Cα atoms of RBD and the ACE2 domain varies significantly for SARSCoV and SARS-CoV2 (Figure 5 (a)). The minimum Cα distance gives an idea of the relative
separation between the two domains. It is observed that the average Cα distance for SARS-CoV
is 5.16±02 Å and for SARS-CoV-2 the average distance between the two domains is 4.15±0.2
Å. The results signify that the SPIKE domain of SARS-CoV is staying ~1.0 Å far away from the
hACE2 domain as that of SARS-CoV-2.

simulations. (b) Number of hydrogen bonds between the RBD and the hACE2 receptor during the 100 ns MD
simulations.

The reason for this may the poor binding of the RBD domain of SPIKE protein with hACE2.
Besides, due to the substitution of four out of five proline-rich domain (472-483) for SARS-CoV2 give more flexibility to the RBD that enhances the protein-protein interaction and the two
domain remains in close proximity. Also, we have calculated the number of hydrogen bonds
formed between the SPIKE domain and the hACE2 domain. In the crystal structure, there are 13
hydrogen bonds present in between SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID: 6VWI), whereas it can be seen that
the number of hydrogen bonds gradually decreases during the MD simulation and the average
number of hydrogen bond is 6.7±2.1. In the case of SARS-CoV, the average hydrogen bond is 6
in the crystal structure whereas the average number of hydrogen bonds in the MD simulation is
found to be 5.26±1.36 (see Figure 5(b)). This result was surprising, as the number of hydrogen
bond is greatly reduced during the MD simulation for SARS-COV-2. Though the two domain
remains in close proximity, the reduction in inter-domain hydrogen bonds signifies the enhanced
hydrophobic interaction in SARS-CoV-2.

molecules that are found 3.5 Å from both the RBD of SPIKE protein and hACE2 receptor. The above results are
shown for the SARS-CoV-2. A similar result is obtained also for the SARS-CoV.

3.4 Role of Interfacial Water Molecules

It is well known that water-mediated interactions are one of the major driving forces of protein
folding and protein-drug recognition processes34–37. In the previous section we observed the there
is almost a 4-5 Å gap in between the SPIK/hACE2 protein-protein complex. There is a possibility
that this interfacial domain or the gap region is hydrated with water molecules and those interfacial
water molecules might play a significant role in stabilizing SPIKE protein and the hACE2 receptor.

Indeed, from our simulations, we observed that water molecules gradually populate the interfacial
domain of SPIKE protein and hACE2 receptors. During the 100 ns simulation period, we
observed that the interfacial domain forms a rich hydrogen-bonded network and stabilize the
overall protein-protein complex.

molecules that are 3.5 Å away from the hACE2 and the RBD domain respectively. The snapshots
are shown here only for the SARS-CoV-2, though a similar kind of results is also obtained for
SARS-CoV.

The fluctuation in the number of water molecules in the interfacial region of the ACE2 domain
shows high water content for SARS-CoV than SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 7(a)). The average water
molecules near the ACE2 domain are 214.2±8.68 and 242.7±10.04 for SARS-CoV-2 and SARSCoV respectively Though the ACE2 interface is almost the same for SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2, there is a higher number of water molecules near the ACE2 interfaces. The probability
plot ( Figure 7 (b)) shows a clear difference in the number of water molecules between SARSCoV and SARS-CoV-2. A similar result can be observed for the RBD domain of SPIKE protein.
A greater number of water molecules can be seen near the SARS-CoV SPIKE domain than that
of the SARS-CoV-2 SPIKE domain (Figure 8(a) and (b)). The high occupancy near the
interfacial domain of SARS-CoV can be attributed to the fluctuation of the RBD and the hACE2
domain and larger gap in between these two domains.

Finally, we calculated the bridge-water molecules that are hydrogen-bonded with both ACE2
and RBD domains at the same time. We calculate the number of water molecules that are
simultaneously forming hydrogen bonds with RBD and the ACE2 domain. In Figure 9 (a) we
display the number of bridge water molecules during 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations and
in Figure 9 (b) we show one bridge water molecule that is hydrogen-bonded to RBD (Gln493) as
well as ACE2(Glu35) domain at the same time. From the simulation trajectories, several multiwater bridge water molecules can be observed in RBD and hACE2 domains. The bridge water
molecules It can be seen that there is a slightly higher number of bridge water molecules (~2) for
SARS-CoV-2 than that of SARS-CoV. These bridging water molecules play a significant role in
stabilizing the two domains of the complex. We expect that these bridge water molecules play a
significant role in stabilizing SPIKE/ACE2 domain. Here we want to highlight one key point that
in the crystal structure (SARS-CoV-2) the Gln493 is engaged in a hydrogen bond with the Glu35,
whereas from MD simulation we observed that water molecules enter into the interfacial region
and connected these two residues.
3.5 Energy Contribution from Interfacial Water Molecules
To have an idea about how the RBD and ACE2 domains are interacting with water molecules,
we calculate the water-mediated hydrogen bonds with RBD and hACE2 domains. In the case of
hACE2, the interfacial residues are making almost the same number of hydrogen bonds with

the water molecules for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. This is expected as the ACE2 receptor
is the same in both the viruses and small changes can be attributed to the fluctuation of the hACE2
domain. In Figure 10 (a), the probability of the number of hydrogen bonds with hACE2 is shown.
The average number of hydrogen bonds formed between the water molecules and the hACE2
domain are 113.9±6.4 and 113.2±6.9 for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 respectively. The
significant changes can be seen near to RBD domain in between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
(Figure 10(b)). The average number of hydrogen bonds that are formed between the interfacial
residues of RBD and water molecules are 115.02±6.4 and109.5±6.22 for SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2. The lesser number of hydrogen bonds for SARS-CoV-2 is the manifestation of mutation
that occurred near the binding domain that enhances the hydrophobic nature at the interfacial
domain.

Finally, we calculated the interaction energy (electrostatic+ van der Waals) between the interfacial
RBD and ACE2 domain with water molecules (Figure 11(a),(b)). We observe that the interaction

energy between the water molecules and the hACE2 domain of both the viruses has almost the
same that means the surface topology of hACE2 are behaves similarly during the MD simulations
for both these viruses. The difference can be seen between the RBD of SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2. Interaction with water molecules is more preferred with SARS-CoV than SARS-CoV-2 as
the water molecules make a greater number of hydrogen bonds with the RBD domain. Enhanced
water interaction with the RBD of SARS-CoV reduces the direct interaction with the hACE2
receptor.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we elucidate the similarities and differences between the SARS-CoV and SARSCoV-2 by using molecular dynamics simulation approaches. From the structural point of view, the
RBD of SPIKE protein shares a significant similarity in terms of the three-dimensional structure
and the fold. However, significant differences are observed in how these two viruses bind to the
hACE2 receptor. We found that improvement in hydrophobic contacts that leads to enhanced van
der Waals interactions between the RBD and the hACE2 receptor affects the high binding affinity
for the SARS-CoV-2. The most important information we found from the study is that involvement
of water molecules at the interfacial domain of the RBD and ACE2 receptor. We observed that for
both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 the interfacial domain is spontaneously hydrated and a
significant number of water molecules populate the gap in between RBD and ACE2 domain. It is
found that bridge water molecules play a significant role in stabilizing the protein-protein binary
complex. This kind of water-mediated interaction for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 did not
observe in the previous study. The present study unravels the many structural and dynamical
features of this protein-protein dimer complexes that help us to understand how this virus interacts
with the human cell.
