Abstract: (184 words)
A significant surge in cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C, also called Pediatric
Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome - PIMS) has been observed amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. MIS-C shares
many clinical features with Kawasaki disease (KD), although clinical course and outcomes are divergent. We
analyzed whole blood RNA sequences, serum cytokines, and formalin fixed heart tissues from these patients
using a computational toolbox of two gene signatures, i.e., the 166-gene viral pandemic (ViP) signature, and its
20-gene severe (s)ViP subset that were developed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection and a 13-transcript
signature previously demonstrated to be diagnostic for KD. Our analyses revealed that KD and MIS-C are on
the same continuum of the host immune response as COVID-19 but diverge with two different cardiac
phenotypes. The ViP signatures helped unravel the nature of the host immune response (IL15-centric) in MIS-C
and KD, reveal unique targetable cytokine pathways in MIS-C, place MIS-C farther along in the spectrum in
severity compared to KD and pinpoint key clinical (reduced cardiac function) and laboratory (thrombocytopenia
and eosinopenia) parameters that can be useful to monitor severity.

INTRODUCTION
Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children

1

(MIS-C; initially named Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem

Syndrome Temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2, PIMS-TS)2 is a rare but severe condition that occurs in
children and adolescents ~4–6 weeks after exposure to SARS-CoV-2. First reported in April 2020 in a cluster of
children in the United Kingdom3, followed by other regions of the world 4, the syndrome is characterized by fever,
and variously accompanied by rash, conjunctival injection, gastrointestinal symptoms, shock, and elevated
markers of inflammation and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in the majority of patients. Myocardial dysfunction and
coronary arterial dilation may resemble those seen in another uncommon childhood condition, Kawasaki Disease
(KD). KD is an acute inflammatory disorder predominantly seen in young children. Since it was first described in
Japan5 in 1967, KD has emerged as the most common cause of pediatric acquired heart disease in the
developed world6. Little is known about the definitive triggers of KD; what is most widely accepted is that KD is
largely an immune response to a plethora of infectious or environmental stimuli including viruses, fungi (e.g.,
Candida sp.), and bacteria

. The host genetic background appears to shape this idiosyncratic inflammatory

7-9

response to an environmental antigen exposure9.
On May 14, 2020, the CDC published an online Health Advisory that christened this condition as
Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and outlined a case definition10. Since then, as the
COVID-19 pandemic spread across many countries, cases of MIS-C soared, with features of shock and cardiac
involvement requiring ionotropic support [in the critical care setting]. But distinguishing MIS-C from KD, KD
shock syndrome11, and other severe infectious or inflammatory conditions remains a challenge. The need for
early diagnostic and prognostic markers of disease severity remains unmet; such markers could objectively guide
decisions regarding the appropriateness of the level of care and the timing of initiation of life-saving supportive
and therapeutic measures.
We recently showed that a 166-gene signature is conserved in all viral pandemics (ViP), including
COVID-19, and a subset of 20-genes within that signature that classifies disease severity12. These properties
inspired the nomenclatures ViP and severe-ViP (sViP) signatures, respectively. Here we used the ViP
signatures as a starting computational framework to navigate the uncharted territory that is MIS-C and to
interrogate the shared and unique features in MIS-C and KD.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A gene signature seen in viral pandemics like COVID-19 is also induced in KD.
We sought to define the host immune response in KD and compare that to COVID-19 using an artificial
intelligence (AI)-based approach. To this end, we took advantage of a recently identified analysis of the host
immune response in COVID-19 in which over 45,000 transcriptomic datasets of viral pandemics were analyzed
to extract a 166-gene signature12 (Figure 1A). Because publicly available transcriptomic datasets from SARSCoV-2-infected patients are still relatively few, the rigor of analysis was increased through the use of an
informatics approach, i.e., Boolean Equivalent Correlated Clusters (BECC13; Figure 1A) that can identify
fundamental invariant (universal) gene expression relationships underlying any biological domain; in this case,
the biological domain of ‘respiratory viral pandemics’ was selected. The 166-gene signature was conserved in
all viral pandemics and outbreaks, reflected host immune response to multiple infectious triggers (Figure 1B),
defined the invariant nature of the host immune response as predominantly IL15/IL15RA-centric, and enabled
the formulation of precise therapeutic goals and measurement of therapeutic efficacy12. At a molecular level,
the ViP signatures were distinct from interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs49,50), in that, they revealed the broader
nature of the host immune response, which included some tell-tale expected (Type I Interferon and cytokine
signaling) and some unique (cellular senescence, exhaustion, chromatin silencing, regulation of apoptosis)
pathway enrichments12. Consequently, the ViP signatures, but not ISGs, were prognostic of disease severity in
cohorts of COVID-19 datasets12.
We used these ViP signatures as quantitative and qualitative framework for measuring the immune
response in publicly available historic cohorts of KD predating COVID-19. Both ViP and sViP signatures were
upregulated in blood and tissue samples derived from patients with KD compared to healthy controls (ROC AUC
for classification of KD vs healthy ranged from 0.8-1.00 across 7 independent cohorts; Figure 1C, left), and that
such induction was limited to the acute phase of KD and downregulated during convalescence (ROC AUC for
classification of KD vs healthy ranged from 0.6-0.8 for ViP and 0.8-1.00 for sViP across 4 independent cohorts;
Figure 1C, middle).
The strength of association between ViP/sViP signatures and acute KD was also preserved in datasets
comprised of KD samples prospectively collected before and after IVIG treatment, and treatment response was
annotated as responder (R) or non-responder (NR) (Figure 1C, right). First, sex had no impact on the induction
of signatures (ROC AUC 0.6 in Males vs Females). Second, although the ViP/sViP signatures did not predict
treatment response to IVIG (ROC AUC 0.5-0.6 in pre-treatment samples R vs NR; GSE63881 and GSE9864),
they were reduced in all responders compared to non-responders (ROC AUC 0.8-0.9 in post-treatment samples
R vs NR; GSE18606). Finally, in a study15 in which the intervention was a combination of IVIG with the
intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP), both ViP signatures were reduced post-Rx (ROC AUC 0.9; GSE16797),
and the signatures performed equally well in both pre-treatment and post-treatment samples in differentiating
responders from non-responders (ROC AUC 0.7-0.8). These findings suggest that while the IVIG-IVMP
combination regimen reduced the signatures effectively among all patients (n = 17), responders induced the ViP

signatures to a lesser extent than non-responders. The 20-gene sViP signature consistently outperformed the
166-gene ViP signature in its ability to classify samples across all cohorts tested (Figure 1C).
We next confirmed that both the ViP signatures are induced in acute KD compared to convalescent KD
in a large new cohort of consecutive patients (n=105) who were diagnosed with the disease prior to the onset of
the COVID-19 pandemic (Cohort 1; Supplementary Table 1) (Figure 1D). Again, the sViP signature
outperformed the ViP signature in sample classification (ROC AUC 0.91 vs. 0.74). In an independent cohort
(Cohort 2, n=20, Supplementary Table 1; Figure 1E) prospectively enrolled in the current study after the onset
of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ViP signatures could differentiate the acute from subacute KD samples. As
before, the 20-gene sViP signature outperformed the 166-gene ViP signature.
Finally, we tested the association between sViP signatures and markers of disease severity. Because
CAA diameter is a predictor of coronary sequelae (thrombosis, stenosis, and obstruction)22,23 and subsequent
major adverse cardiac events (unstable angina, myocardial infarction, and death19), we used the development
of coronary artery aneurysms (CAA) as a marker of disease severity. We found that both ViP signatures
differentiated acute KD with giant CAAs (defined as a z-score of ≥10 or a diameter of ≥8 mm19,20) from
convalescent KD samples (ROC AUC 0.95 and 0.97 for ViP/sViP signatures, respectively; Figure 1F). Such an
analysis was not possible in Cohort #2 (Supplementary Table 1;) because of the smaller cohort size and
absence of subjects with giant CAAs.
We conclude that ViP signatures are induced in acute KD like that seen in COVID-1912. Because ViP
signatures represent the host immune response to diverse pathogens (Figure 1B), upregulation of ViP
signatures in KD is consistent with the hypothesis that KD is triggered by multiple infectious triggers 7,21,22, some
of which may be viral in nature23-25.

Comparison of patients with MIS-C and Kawasaki disease
Ten children were included who met the CDC definitions for MIS-C, with detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid IgG antibodies [Abbott Architect™] and undetectable virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR;
see Figure 2). The MIS-C and KD cohorts had notable differences. Although sex and ethnicity were not different,
the median age was higher (8.8 years) in the MIS-C cohort than in KD (Figure 2A-B), which is in keeping with
our original report describing this syndrome in June 20202. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was reduced
in the MIS-C cohort (p = 0.006), consistent with multiple prior reports26-28. While all patients had evidence of a
marked inflammatory state, the MIS-C cohort had significant cytopenias, including low total WBC, absolute
lymphocyte, absolute eosinophil, and platelet counts, with elevation of C-reactive protein level significantly above
those observed in the KD cohort (Figure 2B). Most patients (90%) received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)

and 70% were treated with intravenous corticosteroids. One patient received anakinra, and three received
infliximab. All patients made a full recovery.
ViP/sViP signatures place MIS-C and KD on the same host immune continuum, but MIS-C as farther
along the spectrum than KD.
We next analyzed whole blood-derived transcriptome and serum cytokine arrays in the current cohort of subjects
with KD (Cohorts 2 and 4) and MIS-C (Figure 3A). Both ViP (Figure 3B) and sViP (Figure 3C) signatures were
induced at significantly higher levels in MIS-C samples compared to acute KD. Heatmaps of patterns of
expression (Figure 3D-E) demonstrate that most of the individual genes contributed to the elevated ViP and
sViP signatures observed in MIS-C samples. These genes included IL15 and IL15RA (highlighted in red; Figure
3D), both components within an invariant cytokine pathway that was previously demonstrated to be elevated in
the lungs of patients with fatal COVID-19 and in SARS-CoV-2 challenged hamsters12.
Taken together, these analyses led to two key conclusions: (i) that the host immune response, as
detected in a qualitative manner using the ViP signatures, is similar in KD and MIS-C and has a IL15/IL15RA
invariant component; (ii) that the degree of such host immune response, as measured quantitatively using the
ViP signature scores, is more intense in MIS-C than KD. These findings are consistent with the fact that MIS-C
is a host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and we previously showed that the interaction of viral
spike protein with the host entry receptor, ACE2 is critical for the induction of ViP signatures12.
A KD-specific signature independently confirms that KD and MIS-C are syndromes on the same host
immune response continuum. To circumvent an over-reliance on one set of signatures (i.e., ViP/sViP), we
next analyzed a KD-specific 13 transcript signature29 that was previously shown to be effective in distinguishing
children with KD from all other febrile conditions. During validation, the 13-transcript signature mirrored the
certainty of clinical diagnosis, i.e., it differentiated definite, highly probable, and possible KD from non-KD with
ROC AUCs of 98.1% (95% CI, 94.5%-100%), 96.3% (95% CI, 93.3%-99.4%), and 70.0% (95% CI, 53.4%86.6%), respectively (Figure 3F). Unlike the ViP signatures, which has a typical enrichment of interferon and
cytokine pathways with a prominent presence of IL15/IL15RA, the KD-signature is comprised of a set of nonoverlapping genes, some of which relate to major central hubs within the tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) and
interleukin 6 (IL6) pathways29. When we applied this signature to the historic cohort (Figure 3G) and to our
current cohort (Cohort 2; Figure 3H), we found that the KD-specific 13 transcript signature could not distinguish
between MIS-C and KD. Furthermore, a correlation test demonstrated that the two non-overlapping signatures,
sViP and KD-13, both of which are significantly induced in KD and MIS-C (Figure 3C) are independent of each
other (Figure S1). The two signatures reflect two fundamentally distinct and unrelated biological domains within
the host immune response, tempting us to speculate that their diagnostic/prognostic abilities may have an
additive benefit.

The similar extent to which KD and MIS- C induced the signature in two independent cohorts further
supports our observation with ViP/sViP signatures (Figure 2) that KD and MIS-C share fundamental aspects of
host immune response with each other, as well as with COVID-19. All three diseases appear to be distinct clinical
states on the same host immune response continuum.
Cytokine panels and whole blood transcriptomes reveal subtle differences between MIS-C and KD
We next analyzed a set of 10 serum cytokines using Meso Scale Discovery Electrochemiluminescence (MSDECL) Ultra-Sensitive Biomarker Assay. A panel of 10 target cytokines was prioritized based on a review of the
literature for the reported presence and/or relevance of each in either KD and/or MIS-C. An unsupervised
clustering of just these 10 cytokines was sufficient to differentiate acute KD and MIS-C from one-year
convalescent KD samples (Figure 4A; Cohorts #2 and #3, Supplementary Table 1); the convalescent samples
served as baseline ‘healthy’ controls in this case. Regardless of their degree of elevation in the acute setting, all
cytokines were virtually undetectable in convalescent samples (Figure S2B). While most cytokines were induced
indistinguishably in acute KD and MIS-C (Figure 4A; Figure S2A, top), notable exceptions were TNFα, IFNγ,
IL10, IL8 and IL1β, all of which were elevated to a greater extent in MIS-C compared to KD (Figure 4B; Figure
S2A, bottom), either significantly (TNFα, IFNγ; Figure 4B) or trended similarly, but failed to reach statistical
significance (IL10, IL1β, IL8). Gene set enrichment analysis on the transcriptomic dataset for each of the
differentially expressed cytokines (Figure 4C) showed that the gene sets for those pathways were also induced
in MIS-C at levels significantly higher than KD (Figure 4D-G).
Taken together, these findings suggest that FDA-approved therapeutics targeting TNFα and IL1β
pathways may be beneficial to treat MIS-C. The IL-1 receptor is expressed in nearly all tissues and its
antagonism by anakinra, a recombinant form of IL-1Ra30, prevents receptor binding of either IL-1α or IL-1β.
Similarly, infliximab, a chimeric antibody to TNFα, has been repurposed for COVID-1931-33, and our analyses
suggest that this agent holds promise as a treatment for MIS-C.
Integrated analyses of ViP/sViP signatures, cytokine profile, and clinical laboratory parameters reveal
unique features of MIS-C and indicators of disease severity. We next sought to understand how similar host
cytokine responses can trigger two distinct clinical syndromes, and how such responses may drive features of
clinical severity. To this end, we first carried out an agglomerative hierarchical clustering of the MIS-C and acute
KD samples using both cytokine profiling (MSD) and clinical/laboratory parameters. This analysis, coupled with
correlation tests (Figure S3) revealed several intriguing observations: (i) visualization by heatmap showed that
compared to KD, MIS-C patients had higher cytokine levels and more severe pancytopenia (Figure 5A); (ii)
although platelet counts (PLT), but not absolute eosinophil counts (AEC) were significantly reduced in MIS-C
compared to KD (Figure 5B), there was a strong positive correlation between PLT and AEC in MIS-C, but not
KD (Figure 5C; left) and strong negative correlations of PLT with IL15 in both KD and MIS-C (Figure 5C; right)
and with MIP1α in MIS-C, but not KD (Figure 5D); (iii) this is consistent with the fact that IL15 and MIP1α were

found to have a strong positive correlation in MIS-C, but not KD (Figure 5E). These findings suggest that MISC has key distinguishing features of thrombocytopenia and low eosinophil counts, and that both features are
negatively correlated with the serum levels of IL15, a key invariant feature of the ViP signature. These findings
also held true when we analyzed the two clinical parameters, PLT and AEC, against ViP/sViP signatures, as well
as a specific IL15/IL15RA composite transcript score from whole blood RNA Seq dataset. We found that PLT
and AEC negatively correlated with ViP (Figure 5F; top), sViP (Figure 5F; middle) and a IL15/IL15RA composite
score (Figure 5F; bottom) in MIS-C, but such correlations were restricted only to PLT in acute KD. These findings
indicate that MIS-C, but not KD, has at least two distinct and interrelated clinical features, thrombocytopenia and
eosinopenia, that appear to be related to the degree of induction of ViP signatures and a IL15-predominant
cytokine induction. Findings also suggest that MIP1α is a key contributor to the immune response in MIS-C and
that its levels are closely and positively related to the levels of IL15.
These findings reveal key similarities and differences among MIS-C, KD and COVID-19.
Thrombocytopenia, which was more pronounced in MIS-C and correlated significantly with IL15 and IL15/IL15
composite transcript score in both KD and MIS-C, has also been reported in COVID-19 and postulated because
of various mechanisms34-38. In the case of KD, thrombocytopenia has been found to be associated with disease
severity40. Similarly, in the case of COVID-19, a large meta-analysis confirmed that approximately 12% of
hospitalized patients have thrombocytopenia, which represents a sign of disease severity and poor outcomes34.
Thrombocytopenia carried a 3-fold enhanced risk of a composite outcome of intensive care unit admission,
progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome, and mortality (odds ratio [OR], 3.49; 95% CI, 1.57–7.78),
and a subgroup analysis confirmed a significant association with mortality (OR, 7.37; 95% CI, 2.08–26.14).
Eosinopenia appears to be a notable shared feature between MIS-C and COVID-1941, but not KD. As in the case
of thrombocytopenia, persistent eosinopenia after admission correlated with COVID-19 severity and low rates of
recovery41.
ViP/sViP signatures track the severity of two distinct cardiac phenotypes in MIS-C and KD.
We next analyzed the relationship between ViP signatures and the prominent and unique cardiac phenotype in
MIS-C reported by others26-28 and observed also in our cohort (Figure 6A), i.e., a significantly reduced LVEF that
can present with cardiogenic shock necessitating ionotropic support. We found that sViP signature scores, but
not ViP or IL15/IL15RA composite scores correlate significantly with LVEF (Figure 6B-D), indicating that LVEF
may belong to the domain of clinical indicators of disease severity in MIS-C (alongside platelets and AEC), but
it may not be directly related to the IL15-centric cytokine signaling. In KD, the ViP and sViP signatures were
tested earlier (Figure 1F) and found to distinguish patients with giant CAA from convalescent samples with ROC
AUC > 0.95. A IL15/IL15RA composite score performed similarly in distinguishing those samples (Figure 6E).
We hypothesized that the ViP signatures may be related to two distinct cardiac phenotypes in severe disease:
the signatures in KD may signify the nature of the vasculitis that drives the formation of CAAs, whereas the same
signature in MIS-C may signify the degree of cardiomyopathy that impairs contractility (Figure 6F). Because we
were unable to acquire cardiac tissues from MIS-C-related autopsies, we carried out immunohistochemical

analyses on cardiac tissues from a case of fatal KD. We found that both IL15 and IL15RA were expressed in the
cardiomyocytes and coronary arterioles amidst extensive fibrosis, as detected using Masson’s trichrome stain
(Figure 6G).
Together, these findings suggest that the IL15/IL15RA induction we see in COVID-19, KD and MIS-C
may have distinct sources and/or target end organs: We previously showed prominent induction of IL15/IL15RA
in the lung alveoli of fatal COVID-19 patients12, and here we show it in the coronary arteries and cardiomyocytes
in KD. Because cardiomyopathy and enteropathy are the commonest presenting features of MIS-C, it is tempting
to speculate that cardiac muscle and various regions of the gastrointestinal tract may be the site of IL15/IL15RA
induction in MIS-C.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Using a combination of publicly available KD datasets and newly recruited cohorts of KD and MIS-C subjects
(summarized in Figure 7A) and a set of gene signatures we report an unexpected discovery regarding the host
immune response in these diagnoses. Our findings show that two distinct clinical syndromes, KD, which predates
the current pandemic by 6 decades, and the novel COVID-19, share a similar profile of host immune response.
The same host immune response is seen also in MIS-C, a new disease that co-emerged with COVID-19, which
has some overlapping features with KD (i.e., clinical presentation, pediatric, etc.), and yet is an immune response
to the virus that causes COVID-19 (Figure 7B-C). We assessed the quality and intensity of the host immune
response in these syndromes with a powerful and unbiased computational tool, the ViP signatures12. Previously
we had demonstrated the usefulness of the ViP signatures to define and measure the host immune response in
COVID-19, identify the site/source of the cytokine storm, track disease severity, objectively formulate therapeutic
goals and track the effectiveness of emerging drugs/biologics12. We now show that the same ViP signatures can
objectively demonstrate the shared immunophenotypes between all three syndromes, which features an
invariant upregulation of the IL15/IL15RA pathway. That a 13 transcript KD-specific signature that was previously
shown to distinguish KD from other non-KD febrile illnesses29 failed to distinguish KD from MIS-C, further
confirmed that KD and MIS-C share identical molecular markers of disease and hence, are fundamentally similar
at the molecular level (summarized in Figure 7B).
Despite the high-level broad similarities, the ViP signatures also helped identify key differences in
clinical/laboratory parameters that may help distinguish MIS-C from KD. First, although the ViP signatures placed
KD and MIS-C on the same host immune continuum, the degree of host immune response in MIS-C is
significantly higher than KD. Higher ViP signatures in MIS-C tracked three major clinical and/or laboratory
parameters (see Figure 7B): (i) degree of thrombocytopenia in severe cases (all three diseases), (ii) eosinopenia
(in COVID-19 and MIS-C, but not KD) and (iii) impaired cardiac contractility (unique to MIS-C, but not KD). An
integrated analysis of serum cytokines and transcriptomics revealed that the proinflammatory MIP1α, TNFα and
IL1 pathways are significantly induced in MIS-C compared to KD. In light of these findings, a rational approach

to MIS-C treatment would be to combine the FDA-approved drugs anakinra30 and infliximab31-33. In fact, during
the preparation of this manuscript a new study has already shown favorable outcome in MIS-C with the use of
Infliximab43.
Finally, our findings reveal a pattern of MIS-C-defining molecular features (IL15/IL15RA, MIP1α, TNFα
and IL1 pathways) and clinical and laboratory parameters (thrombocytopenia, eosinopenia, and reduced
myocardial function). IL15/IL15RA, eosinopenia and thrombocytopenia may be inter-related phenomena in the
setting of infection and inflammation (Figure 7C). Platelets, besides their role in hemostasis, they are known to
participate in the interaction between pathogens and host defense46-48. Persistent thrombocytopenia carried
higher mortality in sepsis42,43, and in COVID-1944,45. Our analysis revealed a direct and unusually strong
correlation between thrombocytopenia and eosinopenia in MIS-C. Eosinophils, on the other hand, as reviewed
elsewhere51, have important antiviral properties, attributed to their granular proteins (e.g., eosinophil-derived
neurotoxin, cationic protein) that display antiviral activities against single-stranded RNA viruses. Eosinophils can
also support viral clearance52. Eosinopenia, in the setting of acute infection, has been found to be a direct
response to infectious stimuli53, TLR4 ligands and chemotactic factors54, and has been considered a reliable
diagnostic marker of infection55 in critically ill patients and a predictor of mortality53-55. It is possible that the two
related clinical/laboratory parameters (low PLT and AEC) may be useful indicators of disease severity and
prognosis in MIS-C and may guide decision-making in therapy and level of care in the hospital setting.

A. Violin plots display the left ventricular ejection functions (LVEF) in KD and MIS-C patients. Significance was
determined by t-test; * = p < 0.05. B-D. Correlation tests between LVEF (Y axis) and gene signature scores on
the X axis [either ViP (B), sViP (C) or a IL15/IL15RA composite (D)] are displayed as a scatter plot and
significance was calculated and displayed as in 5F. The confidence interval around the regression line is
indicated with shades. E. Bar and violin plots show how a IL15/IL15RA compositive score varies between KD
samples. The score classifies KD-AV with giant CAAs from control (KD-CV) samples with a ROC AUC 0.95.
Welch’s two sample unpaired t-test is performed on the composite gene signature score to compute the p values.
In multi-group setting each group is compared to the first control group and only significant p values are
displayed. F. Schematic summarizes how sViP signature classifies two distinct cardiac phenotypes, CAA and
reduced pump function in KD and MIS-C, respectively. G. Consecutive sections from formalin fixed paraffinembedded (FFPE) cardiac tissue collected at autopsy from a child with severe debilitating cardiac complications
of KD were stained for masson’s trichrome, H&E and IL15/IL15RA antigens (left). Healthy heart sections from

and more specifically, the IL15/IL15RA specific gene induction are shared between patients in all three diagnostic
groups. While these signatures are known to be associated with diffuse alveolar damage in the lungs of patients
with COVID-1912, it is associated with CAA in KD and with reduction in cardiac muscle contractility in MIS-C.
