Abstract

Antiviral therapies are urgently needed to treat and limit the development of severe COVID-19
disease. Ivermectin, a broad-spectrum anti-parasitic agent, has been shown to have anti-SARSCoV-2 activity in Vero cells at a concentration of 5 µM. These in vitro results triggered the
investigation of ivermectin as a treatment option to alleviate COVID-19 disease. In April 2021,
the World Health Organization stated, however, the following: “the current evidence on the use
of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 patients is inconclusive”. It is speculated that the in vivo
concentration of ivermectin is too low to exert a strong antiviral effect. Here, we performed a
head-to head comparison of the antiviral activity of ivermectin and a structurally related, but
metabolically more stable, moxidectin in multiple in vitro models of SARS-CoV-2 infection,
including physiologically relevant human respiratory epithelial cells. Both moxidectin and
ivermectin exhibited antiviral activity in Vero E6 cells. Subsequent experiments revealed that
the compounds predominantly act on a step after virus cell entry. Surprisingly, however, in
human airway-derived cell models, moxidectin and ivermectin failed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2
infection, even at a concentration of 10 µM. These disappointing results calls for a word of
caution in the interpretation of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of drugs solely based on Vero cells.
Altogether, these findings suggest that, even by using a high-dose regimen of ivermectin or
switching to another drug in the same class are unlikely to be useful for treatment against SARSCoV-2 in humans.

1. Introduction
Within less than 1.5 year, the pandemic SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over
153 million individuals and resulted in over 3.2 million deaths worldwide (Sohrabi et al., 2020;
WHO, 2021a; Zhou et al., 2020). The social and economic burden of this still ongoing pandemic
is staggering and besides vaccine development, it is of utmost importance to develop therapeutic
interventions to reduce disease symptoms. To date, multiple compounds have been shown to
exert SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity in vitro and several compounds have reached clinical trials
(Chan et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine were thought to be
effective early in the pandemic but after a careful evaluation in an interim solidarity trial, the
WHO released a conditional yet strong recommendation against the usage of these drugs as no
impact on overall mortality was observed (Consortium et al., 2021). Corticosteroids is currently
(April 29th, 2021) the only therapeutic agent strongly recommended by the WHO for the
treatment of severe and critical COVID-19 patients (Siemieniuk et al., 2020). These guidelines,
however, differ from National Institute of Health (NIH) guidelines which recommend antiSARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies for selective patients with mild to moderate disease and
remdesivir, dexamethasone and tocilizumab either individually or in combination based on the
disease severity (NIH, 2021).
Ivermectin, a macrocyclic lactone of the avermectin subfamily, is a broad-spectrum antiparasitic agent approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and
European Medicines Agency (EMA) for prophylactic and therapeutic usage in some animal
species and for selective treatments in humans (EMA, 2009, 2017; Makhani et al., 2019;
Prichard et al., 2012). In recent years, ivermectin has also been shown to have antiviral activity
in vitro towards several viruses including Zika virus (ZIKV) and dengue virus (DENV) (Gotz
et al., 2016; Lundberg et al., 2013; Tay et al., 2013; Varghese et al., 2016; Wagstaff et al.,
2012). In addition, Caly and colleagues (Caly et al., 2020) showed that ivermectin effectively

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.17.444467; this version posted May 17, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero/hSALM cells. The success of ivermectin as an antiviral
agent in vitro has, however, been proven difficult to translate to in vivo settings. For example,
ivermectin failed to protect against lethal ZIKV challenge in mice (Ketkar et al., 2019) and did
not reduce DENV viremia in phase III clinical trials (Yamasmith et al., 2018). It is speculated
that the in vivo concentration of ivermectin is too low to exert its antiviral effect (Bray et al.,
2020; Momekov and Momekova, 2020). Notably, despite the known limitation in achieving
high ivermectin concentrations in humans (Pena-Silva et al., 2020; Schmith et al., 2020) and
the limited in vitro proof of anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity (Caly et al., 2020), 65 ivermectin clinical
trials (April 29th, 2021) are registered as treatment intervention against COVID-19
(clinicaltrials.gov, 2021). Recently, upon review of the latest trail results, many regulatory
authorities including WHO issued a recommendation stating “to not use ivermectin in patients
with COVID-19 except in the context of a clinical trial” as the available evidence to support its
usage is uncertain (Chaccour et al., 2021; Gonzalez et al., 2021; Lopez-Medina et al., 2021;
WHO, 2021b).
Moxidectin, a macrocyclic lactone belonging to the milbemycin subfamily and structurally
related to ivermectin, is a broad-spectrum anti-parasitic used in veterinary medicine. In
addition, it has recently been approved for human use for the prevention of river blindness, a
disease caused by the parasite Onchocerca volvulus (Cobb and Boeckh, 2009; Milton et al.,
2020; Prichard and Geary, 2019). Importantly, moxidectin has been shown to have superior
drug disposition properties to ivermectin such as a longer half-life and higher efficacy in
animals and humans (Opoku et al., 2018; Prichard and Geary, 2019). To date, antiviral potential
of moxidectin towards SARS-CoV-2 has not been evaluated and no clinical trials are registered
for moxidectin as COVID-19 treatment.
In this study, we evaluated the antiviral activity of moxidectin in direct comparison with
ivermectin towards SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. We utilized the commonly used African

green monkey kidney (Vero E6) cells to compare the effective antiviral concentrations and to
evaluate the longevity and mechanistic properties of the compounds. To verify the results in a
physiological more relevant model system we subsequently tested the antiviral activity of both
drugs in the human lung epithelial cells (Calu-3) and in primary human bronchial epithelial
cells (PBECs) grown under air-liquid interface (ALI) culture conditions (Leist et al., 2020).

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Chemicals and reagents
Ivermectin (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) and moxidectin (European pharmacopeia reference
standard, Strasbourg, France) were dissolved in absolute ethanol (EtOH) (Sigma-Aldrich, MO,
USA) to a final concentration of 5 mM and stored at -20 °C. The maximum final EtOH
concentration corresponded to 0.2% in all experiments.
2.2. Virus stock and titration
SARS-CoV-2 strain /NL/2020 (European Virus archive global (EVAg), 010V-03903) was
produced in Vero E6 cells. The cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and
48 hours post-infection (hpi) supernatants containing progeny virions were harvested,
centrifuged, aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. The obtained virus was passaged twice prior to
usage for experiments. The infectious virus titer was determined by a plaque assay on Vero E6
cells. Briefly, Vero E6 cells were infected for 2 h with 10-fold serial dilutions of samples
following, which, cells were overlaid with 1:1 mixture of 2% agarose (Lonza, Basel,
Switzerland) and 2X MEM medium. At 72 hpi, the plaques were fixed using 10% formaldehyde
(Alfa Aesar, Kandel, Germany) and stained using crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA).
Infectious titers are stated as plaque forming units (PFU) per ml. One plaque in 10-fold dilution
corresponds to 150 PFU/ml and was set as the threshold of detection for all experiments.
2.3. Cell culture
The African green monkey Vero E6 cell line (ATCC CRL-1586), kindly provided by Gorben
Pijlman (Wageningen University, Wageningen, the Netherlands) was maintained in Dulbecco’s
minimal essential medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Paiskey, UK), high glucose supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland), penicillin (100 U/mL), and
streptomycin (100 U/mL) (Gibco, Paiskey, UK). The human lung epithelial cell line Calu-3

(ATCC HTB-55) was maintained in DMEM F-12 (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented
with 10% FBS, 1% Glutamax (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), 1% nonessential amino acid (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), penicillin (100
U/mL), and streptomycin (100 U/mL). All cells were mycoplasma negative and maintained at
37 °C under 5% CO2. Primary human bronchial epithelial cells (PBECs) were cultured from
bronchial brushing obtained by fibreoptic bronchoscopy performed using a standardized
protocol during conscious sedation (Heijink et al., 2007; Vieira Braga et al., 2019). The medical
ethics committee of the University Medical Center Groningen approved the study (METC
2019/338), and all subjects gave their written informed consent. The donors were 3 male and 2
female non-smoking healthy control volunteers, with a normal lung function (FEV/FVC > 70%,
FEV1 > 90% predicted) and absence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine (PC20
methacholine > 8 mg/ml). PBECs were cultured and fully differentiated under ALI conditions
in transwell inserts, as previously described (Heijink et al., 2010).
2.4. Cytotoxicity assays
2.4.1. MTS assay
MTS assay, to determine cytotoxicity, was performed using the CellTiter 96 ® AQueous One
Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit using manufacturer’s instructions from Promega
(Madison, WI, USA). Vero E6 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 10,000
cells/well. Following day, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of moxidectin or
ivermectin ranging from 0 to 80 µM for 8 h or with 10 µM of both compounds for 60 h along
with an equivalent volume of EtOH. Thereafter, 20 µl of the MTS/PMS reagent was added to
each well and the cells were further incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, 10% SDS solution
was added to stop the reaction and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm using a microplate
reader (BioTek, Winnooski, VT). Calu-3 cells were seeded in 96-well plate at a density of
40,000 cells/well. Cells were treated with 5 and 10 µM moxidectin, ivermectin or an equivalent

volume of EtOH for 8 h. Same steps were followed as described above for Vero E6 cells.
Cytotoxicity was determined based on the following formula:

% 𝑐𝑦𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑥𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 =

(𝑎𝑏𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒 − 𝑎𝑏𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑏𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑘)
∗ 100
(𝑎𝑏𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑛𝑒𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑜𝑙 − 𝑎𝑏𝑠𝑜𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑏𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑘)

2.4.2. LDH cytotoxicity assay
LDH assay was performed using the CyQUANT™ LDH Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). PBECs cultured under ALI conditions were
treated with 10 µM moxidectin, ivermectin or an equivalent volume of EtOH at the basolateral
side for 48 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, LDH release was determined at the apical side. Hereto, 200
µL of OptiMEM (Gibco, Paiskey, UK) was added to the apical side 30 min prior to the harvest.
The apical harvest was clarified by centrifuging at 2000 x g at 4 °C. Levels of LDH were
determined according to manufacturer’s instructions in all experimental conditions. The
absorbance was measured at 490 and 680 nm using a microplate reader (BioTek, Winnooski,
VT). Absorbance at 680 nm was subtracted from the absorbance at 490 nm and cytotoxicity
was calculated as described below:
% 𝑐𝑦𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑜𝑥𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 =

( 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑 𝑡𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝐿𝐷𝐻 𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦−𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑜𝑢𝑠 𝐿𝐷𝐻 𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦)
( 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑖𝑚𝑢𝑚 𝐿𝐷𝐻 𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦−𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑜𝑢𝑠 𝐿𝐷𝐻 𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦)

∗100

2.4.3. Live/dead staining and flow cytometry
PBECs cultured under ALI conditions were treated with 10 µM moxidectin, ivermectin or an
equivalent volume of EtOH at the basolateral side for 48 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, cells were
harvested by trypsinization and stained with fixable viability dye eFluor780 (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) for 20 min at 4 °C. Next, cells were washed with FACS buffer (1X PBS, 2% FBS,
1% EDTA), centrifuged and fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min at 4 °C. After fixation, cells were
washed, centrifuged and resuspended in FACS buffer. Flow cytometry analyses was performed

using the LSR-2 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and data was further
analyzed using Kaluza analysis software, version 2.1 (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA).
2.5. Antiviral assay in Vero E6 and Calu-3
Vero E6 cells were seeded at a density of 1.3 x105 cells/well in 12-well plates. Next day, the
medium was replaced with 0.25 mL of DMEM (2% FBS) medium containing the virus
inoculum (MOI 1) and in presence of increasing concentration of compounds or the equivalent
volume of EtOH. Following 2 h adsorption at 37 °C, the virus inoculum was removed, after
which the cells were washed twice and fresh DMEM media (10% FBS) containing the
compounds or EtOH was added. At 8 hpi, cell supernatants were harvested and titrated using
plaque assay. For the durability assay, Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI
0.01 and treated with 10 µM of moxidectin, ivermectin or the equivalent volume of EtOH.
Supernatants were collected at 16, 24, 40 and 60 hpi. A lower MOI was used to allow multiple
rounds of infection. Samples were titrated using plaque assay. Calu-3 cells were seeded at a
density of 2 x105 cells/well in 24-well plates. At 48 h post-seeding, infection was performed in
0.2 mL of DMEM (2% FBS) medium containing virus inoculum (MOI 1) and 5 or 10 µM of
moxidectin, ivermectin or the corresponding volume of EtOH. Cell supernatants were harvested
at 8 hpi and titrated using plaque assay.
2.6. Antiviral assay in primary bronchial epithelial cells
Following 3 weeks of ALI culture, human primary bronchial epithelial cells (PBECs) were
washed twice with OptiMEM to remove excess mucus. At the time of infection, 10 µM
moxidectin, ivermectin or the equivalent volume of EtOH was added at the basolateral side of
the insert (12-well). The apical side was inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 5. At 2 hpi, cells
were washed twice with OptiMEM and left on air at 37 °C until collection. Thirty minutes prior
to collection (12, 24 and 48 hpi), 150 µL of OptiMEM was added to the apical side of the ALI

cultures and virus was harvested by incubating for 30 min at 37 °C. Infectious virus titers were
determined using plaque assay.
2.7. Virucidal assay
SARS-CoV-2 particles (2.5 x105 PFUs) were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 µM
moxidectin, ivermectin or the equivalent volume of EtOH for 2 h at 37 °C in 300 µl of DMEM
media (2% FBS). Infectious virus titers were determined using plaque assay.
2.8. Time-of-drug-addition assay
For the time-of-drug-addition experiments, Vero E6 cells were treated with 10 µM moxidectin,
ivermectin or the corresponding volume of EtOH either pre, during, or post-inoculation
conditions (Fig. 2B). For pre-treatment, cells were incubated with the compounds for 2 h prior
to infection. At the time of infection, cells were washed three times and infected with SARSCoV-2 at MOI 1 for 2 h. At 2 hpi, cells were washed three times with plain DMEM, and media
was replaced with DMEM 10% FBS, and incubation was continued until collection. For the
“during” condition, the compounds were present together with the virus inoculum, thus only
during the 2 h infection time. For the post-inoculation conditions, the compounds were added
to the cell culture medium at 2, 4, and 6 h post-inoculation. All supernatants were collected at
8 hpi, clarified by centrifugation and used to quantify the infectious particle titers using plaque
assay.
2.9. Statistical analysis
The concentration at which moxidectin and ivermectin reduced virus particle production by 50
and 90% is referred to as EC50 and EC90, respectively. Dose-response curves were fitted by
non-linear regression analysis employing a sigmoidal model. All data were analyzed in
GraphPad Prism software (La Jolla, CA, USA). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Student T
test was used to evaluate statistical differences between treated samples and a p value ≤ 0.05

was considered significant with * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01 and *** p ≤ 0.001 and ns as nonsignificant.

3. Results
3.1 Moxidectin and ivermectin inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells
First, we assessed the antiviral activity of moxidectin towards SARS-CoV-2 in the African
green monkey kidney epithelial Vero E6 cell line and compared that to the efficacy of
ivermectin. Vero E6 is highly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Matsuyama et al., 2020)
and thus commonly used in studies investigating virus-host interactions and potential antiviral
drugs. Prior to assessing the antiviral efficacy, we determined the cellular cytotoxicity of
moxidectin and ivermectin in Vero E6 cells. A clear dose-dependent cytotoxicity was observed
(Fig. S1). The highest non-toxic dose was set at 10 µM for subsequent experiments. At this
concentration, the cell viability was above 90% for both moxidectin (Fig. S1A) and ivermectin
(Fig. S1B). Next, Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection
(MOI) of 1 in presence of 10 µM moxidectin and ivermectin or the equivalent volume of EtOH
and virus progeny was determined at 8 hpi. This time point corresponds to 1 cycle of replication
(Ogando et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 infection under non-treated (NT) conditions led to a
production of 4.9 ± 0.8 x105 PFU/mL (Fig. 1A). A comparable titer was observed for the EtOH
control (4.3 ± 0.7 x105 PFU/mL), indicating that the solvent does not influence infectious virus
particle production. In line with previous results (Caly et al., 2020), ivermectin was found to
exert significant antiviral activity towards SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells (Fig.1). In presence
of 10 µM ivermectin, infectious virus particle production was reduced to 1.9 ± 0.8 x102
PFU/mL, which corresponds to a reduction of more than 99.9% when compared to the EtOH
control (Fig. 1A). In presence of 10 µM of moxidectin, the infectious virus titer was reduced to

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.17.444467; this version posted May 17, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

4.3 ± 2.0 x102 PFU/mL which also corresponds to a reduction of 99.9% when compared to the
EtOH control (Fig. 1A). Next, we performed a dose-response analysis to determine the EC50
and EC90 values (i.e. a reduction of 50% and 90% in viral titer, respectively). To this end, Vero
E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of both
moxidectin, ivermectin, and the corresponding amount of EtOH. Moxidectin and ivermectin
showed a dose-dependent antiviral activity in Vero E6 (Fig. 1B), with an EC50 and EC90 of
4.5 µM and 7.2 µM for moxidectin and 1.9 µM and 5.8 µM for ivermectin, respectively (Fig.
1B). The observed EC50 for ivermectin is in line with the previously published value of ~ 2µM
(Caly et al., 2020). Thus, both compounds exhibit potent antiviral effects towards SARS-CoV2, ivermectin being slightly more potent than moxidectin in this experimental set-up.
Given the known increased stability of moxidectin over ivermectin we next evaluated the
durability of the antiviral effect for both compounds. To this end, Vero E6 cells were infected
with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 0.01 in presence of 10 µM of moxidectin, ivermectin or
corresponding amount of EtOH and the cell supernatants were harvested at 16, 24, 40 and 60
hpi. These time points roughly correspond to 2, 3, 5 and 7 SARS-CoV-2 replication cycles,
respectively (Ogando et al., 2020). Importantly, the prolonged incubation of the cells with
moxidectin and ivermectin did not influence cell viability as measured with the MTS assay
(Fig. S1C).

At 40 hpi, 3.5 ± 0.4 x107 PFU/mL were produced at non-treated infection

conditions and at this time point virus particle production reached its plateau (Fig. 1C).
Comparable titers were observed over time for the EtOH control (3.4 ± 0.2 x107 PFU/mL at 40
hpi), indicating that EtOH had no effect on virus progeny production. More than 100-fold
reduction in virus particle production was observed at 16, 24 and 40 hpi following infection in
presence of moxidectin or ivermectin (Fig. 1C). At 60 hpi, ivermectin, showed antiviral activity
for 2 experiments, yet there was a considerable variation between the other 2 experiments and
therefore no significant antiviral effect was seen. In contrast, a moderate but consistent antiviral

effect of moxidectin was seen at 60 hpi. At this time point the titer reduced from 9.9 ± 2.9 x106
PFU/mL (EtOH control) to 1.5 ± 1.0 x106 PFU/mL, which corresponds to a reduction of 84.8%.
Taken together, a single 10 µM dose of both compounds controlled SARS-CoV-2 replication
for at least 5 replication cycles. For moxidectin, a more consistent antiviral effect is observed
lasting until 7 replication cycles.

cells. Vero E6 cells were treated with 10 μM moxidectin or ivermectin in the presence of SARSCoV-2 at MOI 1. At 2 h post-infection (hpi), cells were washed twice with plain DMEM
medium and new cell culture medium containing the compound was added and incubation was
continued for another 6 h. At 8 hpi, cell supernatants were harvested and number of produced
infectious virus particles were determined by plaque assay. (B) Vero E6 cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of moxidectin or ivermectin and infection was continued as described
above (A). The EC50 and EC90 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism software. (C)

Antiviral effect of 10 µM moxidectin or ivermectin or the corresponding volume of EtOH at
16, 24, 40 and 60 hpi. The dotted lines indicate the detection limit of plaque assay. Each dot
represents data from a single independent experiment. Data are represented as mean ± SEM of
at least three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was carried out by comparing treated
samples with the EtOH control using Student’s t-test *** p < 0.001, ** p< 0.01, * p <0.05 and
ns as non-significant.

3.2 Moxidectin and ivermectin interfere with SARS-CoV-2 replication
To delineate the mode-of-action of the drug, we first investigated whether moxidectin and
ivermectin exhibit a direct virucidal effect. To this end, 10 µM of moxidectin, ivermectin or the
corresponding amount of EtOH control was incubated with 2.5 x105 SARS-CoV-2 particles at
37 °C for 2 h and the infectious titer was determined by plaque assay. The highest concentration
in the diluted sample corresponded to 1 µM compound and at this concentration no antiviral
effect in Vero E6 cells was observed (Fig. 1B) and therefore the plaque assay can be used as
readout. Importantly, no differences in viral titer were observed between the moxidectin or
ivermectin-treated samples and the EtOH control (Fig. 2A), indicating that these compounds
do not exhibit virucidal activity to SARS-CoV-2 particles. Next, we performed a time-of-drugaddition assay. Here, 10 µM of moxidectin or ivermectin was administered either prior to virus
inoculation, during virus inoculation, or post-virus inoculation (Fig. 2B). Cells were infected
with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 1 and supernatants were collected at 8 hpi to determine
progeny infectious virus particle production. Each treatment included a corresponding EtOH
control. No effect on the viral titers were observed when the compounds were added prior to
inoculation. For the ‘during’ condition, no significant effect was seen for moxidectin and a
significant albeit limited effect was observed for ivermectin. A strong reduction in viral titer
was seen when the compounds were added at 2 hpi (Fig. 2C). For moxidectin, the infectious
virus titer was reduced to 1.5 ± 1.0 x103 PFU/mL corresponding to a reduction of 98.6% and
for ivermectin, the titer was reduced to 1.5 ± 0.8 x102 (99.9% reduction) when compared to the

corresponding EtOH control. No significant effect was seen when moxidectin or ivermectin
were added at 4 or 6 hpi when compared to EtOH control (Fig. S2). Collectively, these results
indicate that both moxidectin and ivermectin directly interfere with the viral infectious
replication cycle in cells. This shows that the compounds either act at the early stages of RNA
replication/translation (within 2-4 h post-infection) or that the compounds interfere with late
stages of virus assembly/secretion (i.e. needs to be present for more than 4 h to exert its antiviral
effect).

3.3 Moxidectin and ivermectin do not exhibit anti- SARS-CoV-2 activity in
Calu-3 and primary human bronchial epithelial cells
We next sought to validate the antiviral potential of moxidectin and ivermectin in the human
lung epithelial Calu-3 cells, cells which have previously been shown to support SARS-CoV-2
replication (Chu et al., 2020). Prior to infectivity assays, the cellular cytotoxicity of both
compounds at 5 and 10 µM was determined using the MTS assay. At these concentrations, no
cytotoxicity was observed (Fig. S3). Accordingly, we proceeded by infecting Calu-3 cells with
SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 1 in the presence or absence of 5 µM and 10 µM of moxidectin or
ivermectin. In the absence of the drugs (NT condition), infection led to a release of on average,
1.5 ± 2.3 x104 PFU/mL at 8 hpi (Fig. 3A). A comparable titer was observed for the EtOH control
(1.7 ± 2.5 x104 PFU/mL). To our surprise, however, no significant reduction in viral titers was
observed following infection in presence of moxidectin and ivermectin, indicating that at these
experimental conditions, the compounds did not exhibit an antiviral effect in Calu-3 cells.
As the human respiratory tract represents the primary site of virus infection (Jonsdottir and
Dijkman, 2016), we decided to further verify the antiviral activity of moxidectin and ivermectin
in a human-based cell system. Hereto, we used PBECs cultured under ALI culture system. Cells
grown under ALI conditions undergo cellular differentiation, thus mimicking crucial
physiological properties similar to that found in vivo (Cao et al., 2020; Jia et al., 2005; Sims et
al., 2008). Prior to performing the antiviral assays in this model system, we first assessed the
cytotoxicity of 10 µM moxidectin and ivermectin at 48 h of treatment using live-death staining
and a LDH release assay. Both assays showed a viability above 90% compared to EtOH control
(Fig. S4). ALI-cultured PBECs were incubated with 10 µM of moxidectin or ivermectin at the
basolateral side and infected with SARS-CoV-2 at MOI 5 at the apical side as indicated in the
schematics (Fig. 3B). Supernatants were harvested from the apical side at 12, 24 and 48 hpi and
titers were determined using plaque assay. Importantly, despite the strong antiviral effect in
Vero E6 cells, no significant antiviral activity was seen in the apical washes of moxidectin or

ivermectin treated PBECs when compared to the EtOH control at all-time points tested (Fig.
3C). Next to moxidectin and ivermectin, we also tested antiviral activity of resveratrol in the
same donors and observed a potent antiviral effect in this model system thereby confirming the
validity of the experimental settings (Ellen et al., 2020).

4. Discussion
We confirm previously published antiviral activity of ivermectin (Caly et al., 2020) in Vero E6
cells and showed an antiviral effect of moxidectin against SARS-CoV-2 in these cells. Further
in-depth mode-of-action experiments revealed that moxidectin and ivermectin actively interfere
with virus replication. Unfortunately, despite the promising antiviral properties of moxidectin
and ivermectin in Vero E6 cells, the drugs did not show any antiviral activity in human airwayderived cell models. Collectively, the data show that the potency of moxidectin and ivermectin
are species or cell-type specific and provide an explanation for the discordant findings in
literature where positive effects were found in Vero cells, but no clinically relevant patient
outcomes could be demonstrated in human studies.
To demonstrate which steps of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle are affected by moxidectin
or ivermectin in Vero E6 cells, we performed a time-of-drug-addition experiments. The
strongest effect was seen when moxidectin or ivermectin are added after the onset of infection
suggesting the compounds do not interfere with processes related to viral entry like virus-cell
binding, internalization or membrane fusion. We hypothesize that the compounds either directly

interfere with early stages of RNA translation/replication or indirectly at late stages of the virus
replication cycle (due to prolonged incubation). Other studies revealed that ivermectin blocks
replication of HIV-1 and DENV viruses (Tay et al., 2013; Wagstaff et al., 2012), by binding
and inhibiting cellular importin (IMP) α/β- mediated transport of viral proteins to the nucleus
(Wagstaff et al., 2011; Wagstaff et al., 2012). Ivermectin has also been shown to inhibit NS3
helicase activity thereby inhibiting flavivirus replication (Mastrangelo et al., 2012). Our
findings hint towards a mechanism where both drugs restrict SARS-CoV-2 replication by
modulating cellular factors or processes, which control replication in Vero E6 cells but are
absent in human-derived Calu-3 and PBECs.
Currently (April 29th, 2021), 65 clinical trials are registered that evaluate the efficacy of
ivermectin as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug and 21 of these are completed
(clinicaltrials.gov, 2021). Many of these trials have serious limitations such as small sample
size, lack of binding, lack of pre-registration for some trials and therefore carries a risk of bias
(Ahmed et al., 2021; Chaccour et al., 2021; Chowdhury et al., 2020; Elgazzar et al., 2020;
Hashim et al., 2020; Okumuş et al., 2021; Podder et al., 2020; Rajter et al., 2021; Soto-Becerra
et al., 2020; WHO, 2021b). Apart from the problem of bias, only five trials (April 29, 2021),
directly compared ivermectin with standard of care and reported clinically crucial outcomes
such as mortality (Gonzalez et al., 2021; Lopez-Medina et al., 2021; Mohan et al., 2021; Niaee
et al., 2020; Ravikirti. et al., 2021). The WHO recently stated: “the current evidence of effect
of ivermectin on mortality, mechanical ventilation, hospital admission and duration of
hospitalization remains uncertain” (WHO, 2021b). Yet, many clinical trials are still ongoing.
The observed lack of antiviral activity of ivermectin in the biologically relevant PBECs model
reported here together with the poor pharmacological properties of ivermectin (Momekov and
Momekova, 2020; Pena-Silva et al., 2020; Schmith et al., 2020) do not forecast a success of the
ongoing clinical trials for its usage in COVID-19 patients.

SARS-CoV-2 can also infect several economically important livestock such as cats, dogs,
minks, lions and tigers (Lam et al., 2020; McAloose et al., 2020; Oreshkova et al., 2020;
Patterson et al., 2020; Sharun et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020). Inhibition of virus replication in
these animals could thus offer an effective strategy to control virus dissemination. Both drugs
inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in African green monkey-derived kidney epithelial (Vero E6)
cells. Since both the compounds have already been FDA-approved for the use in animals
(Gonzalez Canga et al., 2009; Nolan and Lok, 2012), our results in Vero E6, warrant follow-up
studies in relevant animal cell systems to assess their potential as antivirals in economically
important livestock.
In conclusion, we elucidated that while both moxidectin and ivermectin exhibit antiviral
activity in Vero E6, they do not reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication in human airway-derived cell
models. While immortalized cells lines such as Vero E6 may be useful in a primary screening
of inhibitors, it is important to determine true relevance of the inhibitors in a biological relevant
model. In humans, airway epithelium is the main target for SARS-CoV-2 (de Melo et al., 2020;
Leist et al., 2020) and therefore PBECs grown under ALI conditions, but not Vero cells, mimic
crucial physiological properties similar to that found in vivo (Cao et al., 2020; Jia et al., 2005;
Sims et al., 2008). We therefore advocate more rigorous antiviral drug testing in relevant
systems prior to evaluating their efficacy in clinical trials.
