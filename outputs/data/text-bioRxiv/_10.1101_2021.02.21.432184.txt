Abstract

19

Tracking evolution of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)

20

within infected individuals will help elucidate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

21

pathogenesis and inform use of antiviral interventions. In this study, we developed an approach

22

for sequencing the region encoding the SARS-CoV-2 virion surface proteins from large numbers

23

of individual virus RNA genomes per sample. We applied this approach to the WA-1 reference

24

clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 passaged in vitro and to upper respiratory samples from 7 study

25

participants with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from cell culture were diverse, including

26

18 haplotypes with non-synonymous mutations clustered in the spike NH2-terminal domain

27

(NTD) and furin cleavage site regions. By contrast, cross-sectional analysis of samples from

28

participants with COVID-19 showed fewer virus variants, without structural clustering of

29

mutations. However, longitudinal analysis in one individual revealed 4 virus haplotypes bearing

30

3 independent mutations in a spike NTD epitope targeted by autologous antibodies. These

31

mutations arose coincident with a 6.2-fold rise in serum binding to spike and a transient increase

32

in virus burden. We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a capacity for rapid genetic adaptation

33

that becomes detectable in vivo with the onset of humoral immunity, with the potential to

34

contribute to delayed virologic clearance in the acute setting.

Author Summary

36

Mutant sequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) arising

37

during any individual case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could theoretically enable

38

the virus to evade immune responses or antiviral therapies that target the predominant infecting

39

virus sequence. However, commonly used sequencing technologies are not optimally designed to

40

detect variant virus sequences within each sample. To address this issue, we developed novel

41

technology for sequencing large numbers of individual SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA molecules

42

across the region encoding the virus surface proteins. This technology revealed extensive genetic

43

diversity in cultured viruses from a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2, but lower diversity in

44

samples from 7 individuals with COVID-19. Importantly, concurrent analysis of paired serum

45

samples in selected individuals revealed relatively low levels of antibody binding to the SARS-

46

CoV-2 spike protein at the time of initial sequencing. With increased serum binding to spike

47

protein, we detected multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants bearing independent mutations in a single

48

epitope, as well as a transient increase in virus burden. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2

49

replication creates sufficient virus genetic diversity to allow immune-mediated selection of

50

variants within the time frame of acute COVID-19. Large-scale studies of SARS-CoV-2

51

variation and specific immune responses will help define the contributions of intra-individual

52

SARS-CoV-2 evolution to COVID-19 clinical outcomes and antiviral drug susceptibility.

Introduction

54

Although SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversification was initially slow as the virus spread around the

55

world (1), the extent and implications of intra-individual virus evolution during COVID-19 are

56

still being explored. Close genetic relationships among single-person SARS-CoV-2 consensus

57

sequences do not rule out intra-individual evolution because virus burden and transmissibility

58

peak shortly after acquisition (2-4), before the development of adaptive immune responses that

59

could select transmissible virus variants. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 evolution has been detected

60

in people with compromised immunity, with shifts in virus consensus sequences detected during

61

prolonged shedding (5-9). In early infection, however, analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences has

62

not routinely demonstrated directional genetic change. Sites in the virus genome showing

63

significant intra-individual variation have been found in cross-sectional data (10-14), with one

64

study linking the number of variant sites to disease severity at the time of study (15).

65

Nonetheless, studies in clinically diverse cohorts have found that SARS-CoV-2 consensus

66

sequences (16) and minor variants (14) remain stable in most people over time. These findings

67

would suggest that immune responses against transmitted virus strains should continue to target

68

replicating viruses throughout the course of each individual’s infection.

69

An important obstacle to understanding intra-individual evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is that

70

standard sequencing and analytical procedures yield a single consensus sequence for each sample,

71

rather than multiple sequences representing virus quasispecies diversity. Standard procedures

72

typically either amplify virus RNA in fragments spanning the genome or produce meta-

73

transcriptome libraries of fragments from the entire sample (17), followed by short-read deep

74

sequencing, read alignment or assembly, and virus genome consensus determination. These

75

approaches readily cover nearly the entire 30-kilobase length of the SARS-CoV-2 genome for

76

samples from hundreds or thousands of people at a time, helping to define inter-individual virus

77

variation on a global scale (1). However, combined amplification from multiple genomes and the

78

“shotgun” sequencing of long regions in small fragments can both disrupt genetic linkage and

79

prevent error correction at the level of individual haplotypes. Analysis of intra-individual

80

variation within resulting data is thus largely limited to the detection of genome positions at

81

which variation occurs at levels exceeding the background variation that invariably arises from

82

sample amplification and sequencing errors. As a result, standard methods could miss important

83

patterns of intra-individual SARS-CoV-2 diversity and evolution due to insufficient

84

discrimination of true signal from technical noise.

85

In this report we use a single-genome amplification and sequencing (SGS) approach to

86

investigate the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in samples from people with COVID-19. Our

87

approach is conceptually similar to conventional SGS procedures, which amplify single

88

molecules at limiting dilution for Sanger sequencing (18, 19). However, to obtain a broad view

89

of the SARS-CoV-2 variant pool, we developed a high-throughput SGS (HT-SGS) strategy

90

employing long-read deep sequencing of the surface protein gene region from large numbers of

91

individual virus genomes. Our results demonstrate the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 genetic

92

variants under host immune pressure during acute infection.

Validation of HT-SGS for SARS-CoV-2 Surface Protein Gene Sequencing

95

We developed an HT-SGS approach for sequencing individual virus RNA genomes within each

96

sample across the spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), and membrane (M) protein genes. This

97

approach employs unique molecular identifier (UMI) tags added to the virus genome

98

complementary DNA (cDNA) during reverse transcription (Fig 1A and S1 Fig), and incorporates

99

several layers of error correction in a custom bioinformatic pipeline (Fig 1A and S2 Fig). These

100

include (i) consensus formation from reads with matching UMIs to remove PCR errors and those

101

sequencing errors not addressed by circular consensus sequence (CCS) correction (20), (ii) initial

102

removal of UMI bins with outlying low read counts by inflection point filtering (S2B Fig), (iii)

103

network-based filtering to exclude false UMI bins arising from PCR or sequencing errors in the

104

UMI (see Materials and Methods), and (iv) stringent removal of UMI bins with low read counts

105

by knee point filtering (S2C Fig). Reverse transcription error is then addressed by (v) flagging

106

unique and potentially spurious insertions/deletions (indels) and other rare mutations by variant

107

calling, for reversion to the sample consensus, and (vi) exclusion of sequence haplotypes

108

occurring in only 1 UMI bin (i.e., unique SGS).

109

To validate our method, we applied it to clonal RNA transcripts representing the USA/WA-1

110

sequence (wt) or a double-mutant (2M) sequence that included two scrambled 20-base sections

111

at the ends of the target region (Fig 1B). Using UMI bin consensus sequences obtained after knee

112

point filtering, we calculated error rates of 0.00024/base for the wt target and 0.00025/base for

113

the 2M target. No inter-template recombinants were detected. Putative errors included both

114

single-nucleotide substitutions and short indels, and likely represented a combination of reverse

115

transcription, PCR, sequencing errors as well as in vitro transcription errors and plasmid

mutations. After a completed analysis including variant calling, rare mutation reversion, and

117

exclusion of unique SGS, we found that all remaining sequences exactly matched their

118

corresponding references, with quantitative recovery of the two targets from a dilution series

(Table I). These results support the high accuracy of our data generation and analytical approach.

HT-SGS Analysis of a Cultured Clinical Isolate of SARS-CoV-2

124

To begin evaluating intra-sample diversity of SARS-CoV-2, we applied our HT-SGS process to

125

a 4th-passage Vero cell culture of the WA-1 reference clinical isolate. As shown in Figure 2A,

126

the consensus of all HT-SGS sequences from this sample exactly matched the WA-1 reference

127

sequence, consistent with the high accuracy of the method. However, data analysis at the single-

128

genome level revealed 18 unique SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes detected in between 3 and 174

129

individual virus genomes per haplotype, with each single-genome consensus supported by >500

130

sequence reads (Fig 2A-B). More than half (57.6%) of all SGS differed from the reference

131

consensus sequence at one or more nucleotide positions (Fig 2A). All 17 mutations detected in

7

132

variant virus genomes were non-synonymous, suggesting selective pressure on the virus.

133

Structurally, mutations were clustered almost exclusively in the spike NTD and furin cleavage

134

site regions. The NTD mutations included 9 distinct single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 2

135

distinct insertions that added positively-charged or removed negatively-charged amino acid

136

residues at the NTD outer surface (Fig 2A and 2C), consistent with observed selection patterns in

137

other virus envelope proteins during cell culture adaptation (21, 22). Mutations in the area of the

138

furin cleavage site included 3 SNVs and one deletion of 12 amino acids (Fig 2A and 2C), and

139

were consistent with mutations observed in this region after in vitro passage in other studies (23).

140

The remaining 2 mutations encoded a T307I substitution in spike, linked with R682L at the furin

141

cleavage site, and a T7I substitution in the M gene found both in isolation and linked with 2

142

different spike NTD mutations (Fig 2A). Overall, these results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2

143

can accumulate considerable genetic diversity, as revealed by analysis of HT-SGS data at the

144

single-genome level.

145

HT-SGS Performance in Direct Ex Vivo Sequencing of SARS-CoV-2

146

We anticipated that, compared to high-quality RNA preparations from cultured virus, human

147

respiratory samples would contain variable levels of intact SARS-CoV-2 genomes, and that

148

contaminants and inhibitors of steps in the HT-SGS process might also be present. We therefore

149

evaluated the performance of HT-SGS using upper respiratory samples from 7 people with

150

COVID-19 (S1 Table). Using droplet-digital reverse-transcription PCR (ddRT-PCR) to quantify

151

two regions within the SARS-CoV-2 N gene, we detected virus loads in these samples ranging

152

from 314 to >3 million RNA copies/mL. By comparison, our recovery of cDNA encompassing

153

the S, E, and M gene region in HT-SGS was considerably lower (Table II). This discrepancy was

154

consistent with multiple differences between the two measurements, including the presence of

155

subgenomic RNAs containing ddRT-PCR target but lacking intact HT-SGS target sequences;

156

lower efficiency of cDNA synthesis across our 6.1-kilobase HT-SGS target region than across

157

short ddRT-PCR targets; and some degree of RNA degradation preferentially affecting HT-SGS.

158

Similarly, yields of single-genome consensus sequences recovered by HT-SGS ranged from 8.8%

159

to 26.0% of input cDNA copy numbers (Table II), likely due to a combination of cDNA

160

degradation and loss; failure of some cDNA molecules to amplify during PCR; and highly

161

stringent read count cutoffs that we employed in the bioinformatic analysis in an effort to ensure

162

accuracy of all reported sequences. Despite these considerations, however, yields at each step of

163

the process were correlated with sample virus loads (S3 Fig), with recovery of between 12 and

164

1,276 single-genome consensus sequences for the samples studied (Table II). Moreover,

165

although we sequenced these samples to a high depth (7,499-462,919 raw reads/sample), we

166

observed that detection of distinct virus haplotypes was highly reproducible in random

167

subsamples down to a level of 5% (S4 Fig). This indicates that multiple samples can be

168

combined in individual HT-SGS sequencing runs while still achieving sufficient depth to detect

169

minor variant sequences.

Cross-sectional analysis of SARS-CoV-2 diversity and humoral immunity during acute

176

Because the mutations we detected in cultured virus resembled those described for SARS-CoV-2

177

and other viruses during culture adaptation, we interpreted the extensive diversity observed as

178

evidence of virus diversification in vitro rather than in the source patient. We therefore analyzed

179

the diversity of HT-SGS sequences obtained from the 7 study participants in S1 Table. In

180

samples taken between 8 and 17 days since the onset of clinical illness (each representing the

181

earliest available sample for the individual), we detected only a single virus haplotype in

182

participants 1, 2, and 6 (range of SGS counts, 31-1276/participant) and 2-3 haplotypes in each of

183

the remaining 4 participants (range of SGS counts, 13-1210/participant; Fig 3). In addition, we

184

noted no clear structural signature among the 7 mutations that defined intra-individual variant

185

haplotypes, with 1 SNV in the downstream region of the spike gene, 4 SNVs in the non-

186

structural ORF3 and ORF6 genes, and 2 synonymous SNVs (Fig 3). Overall, therefore, cross-

187

sectional HT-SGS analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences in 7 individuals was notable for relative

188

sequence homogeneity, as compared to results from cultured virus.

189

To reconcile the extensive diversity among SARS-CoV-2 genomes in vitro with the lesser

190

diversity detected in ex vivo samples, we hypothesized a relationship between virus diversity and

191

host antibody responses arising after the establishment of infection. To investigate this, we used

192

biolayer interferometry (BLI) to analyze antibody profiles in participants from whom

193

longitudinal serum samples were available (i.e., participants 1 and 3). In these individuals, we

194

observed a marked rise in autologous serum binding to spike protein between the earliest

195

available timepoint (participant 1, day 9 and participant 3, day 17) and later timepoints

196

(participant 1, days 16 and 19 and participant 3, day 27; Fig 4). The increase in total serum

197

binding to spike was 6.2-fold between days 12 and 16 in participant 1 and 5.75-fold between

198

days 17 and 27 in participant 3. Using monoclonal antibody (mAb) competition to map domain-

199

specific responses, we detected serum binding to NTD, receptor-binding domain (RBD), and S2

200

domain in both participants (Fig 4). We also observed a continued increase in serum binding not

201

competed by any tested mAb panel in participant 1 (Fig 4A, days 16 and 19, grey bars),

202

suggesting progressive broadening of the binding response. Taken together, these findings

203

indicated that samples with low levels of SARS-CoV-2 variation had been taken before full

204

development of circulating antibody responses to the virus spike.

205

Intra-individual SARS-CoV-2 evolution during acute infection

206

We next investigated the relationship between mounting spike-directed antibody responses and

207

the levels and sequences of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory secretions from participant 1. We

208

found that the burden of SARS-CoV-2 RNA declined substantially but irregularly between days

209

9 and 17 (Fig 5A). Between days 9 and 13, virus RNA declined by nearly 4 orders of magnitude,

from 2.83 x 106 (N2) – 3.0 x 106 (N1) copies/mL to 3.14 x 102 (N1) – 3.86 x 102 (N2) copies/mL.

211

However, virus RNA subsequently increased to 1.11 x 104 (N2) – 1.35 x 104 (N1) copies/mL on

212

day 15, before declining again on day 17. This pattern was associated with the emergence of 2

213

minor variant SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes on day 11 and 4 minor variant haplotypes on day 15 (Fig

214

5B). Strikingly, these variants together bore 3 independent non-synonymous mutations within a

215

single NTD epitope. On day 11, a C-to-T transition causing an H-to-Y change at amino acid

216

residue 146 was found in 10/882 (1.1%) genomes sequenced. After a low virus RNA burden on

217

day 13 with detection of only the consensus virus variant, sequencing on day 15 revealed

218

deletions of either residues 141-144LGVY or residue 144Y alone. These mutations were found

219

in 3 different haplotypes that accounted for 70/284 (26.1%) genomes sequenced on day 15 (Fig

220

5B, bar graph). Structural modeling onto the spike trimer (Fig 5C) indicated that these mutations

221

were located in a supersite of vulnerability targeted by potent neutralizing antibody 4A8 (24),

222

where similar mutations have been observed in case reports of persistent infections (5, 6) and a

223

larger study of recurrently deleted regions (9). Therefore, we performed additional serum

224

antibody mapping studies with this mAb and found that before the NTD mutations had emerged

225

in autologous viruses, autologous serum antibodies against NTD predominantly recognized the

226

4A8 epitope (Fig 5D). Taken together, these results demonstrated a close temporal relationship

227

between the development of SARS-CoV-2 spike NTD-specific antibodies in serum, the

228

independent emergence of multiple mutations in a region of the NTD targeted by these

229

antibodies, and a transient delay in virus clearance.

Discussion

231

Here we developed and validated a novel method that accurately sequences the 6.1-kilobase

232

SARS-CoV-2 surface protein gene region from large numbers of individual virus genomes.

233

Using this method, we analyzed virus genetic diversity both in vitro and in respiratory secretions

234

from people with COVID-19. In contrast to in vitro passaged viruses, which exhibited extensive

235

diversity fitting patterns associated with culture adaptation (21-23), we initially found relatively

236

low intra-individual SARS-CoV-2 diversity ex vivo. These results appeared consistent with the

237

slow evolution among worldwide virus sequences during the early months of the pandemic (1).

238

Nevertheless, our relatively homogeneous cross-sectional sequencing findings in people with

239

COVID-19 were not due entirely to intrinsic limitations on SARS-CoV-2 diversity. Instead,

240

longitudinal analysis during the second and early third weeks of illness in one person revealed a

241

transient increase in virus burden and multiple new virus variants in which 3 different mutations

242

in an epitope of the spike NTD had arisen independently. The mutated epitope was previously

243

shown to be a neutralizing antibody target (24), and was identified herein as a major target for

244

antibodies in the autologous serum. Our results therefore suggest selection of SARS-CoV-2

245

spike variants by mounting antibody responses in the acute setting.

246

Mutational evasion of adaptive immune responses by SARS-CoV-2 during acute COVID-19 has

247

not been clearly documented previously. This relationship may have been overlooked in part due

248

to the emphasis on tracking new mutations on a global scale, with a predominance of cross-

249

sectional rather than longitudinal analyses of infected individuals. The early peak of SARS-CoV-

250

2 RNA in respiratory secretions may also favor high-quality data acquisition in very early

251

infection, leading to overrepresentation of individuals in whom virus populations have not yet

252

been subjected to adaptive immune pressure. Another important consideration is the sequencing

253

method used. Our method was specifically developed for high-throughput analysis of single

254

virus RNA molecules, and incorporates several layers of error correction that aid in

255

distinguishing true variation from technical errors. This allowed groups of important virus

256

variants to be detected even though each variant individually accounted for a small proportion of

257

all sequences in each sample. Finally, we cannot rule out that our distinctive findings might

258

relate to our longitudinal study participant’s history of stem cell transplantation. It is possible

259

that immune suppression can lead to higher levels of virus replication and thus an unusually

260

rapid accumulation of “total-body” virus diversity in vivo. However, we noted that our

261

longitudinal participant was no longer receiving immune suppressive medication at the time of

262

COVID-19 diagnosis, and measurements of virus burden in respiratory secretions were

263

consistent with previous studies in immunocompetent participants (25, 26). Wider application of

264

our combined virological and immunological approach in diverse clinical cohorts will aid in

265

defining circumstances under which SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants may emerge under immune-

266

mediated pressure.

267

Tracking intra-individual virus evolution is of great interest in understanding SARS-CoV-2

268

pathogenesis and treatment. As our longitudinal study participant recovered clinically, spike

269

variants detected by HT-SGS were replaced by unmutated sequences even though the variant

270

sequences might have avoided neutralization by 4A8-like antibodies in vivo. This was likely due

271

to a broadly-targeted antiviral response, including innate defenses, antiviral T cells, and multiple

272

antibody specificities, each potentially with distinct kinetics during the transition from acute

273

infection to convalescence. The absence of spike RBD variants in our longitudinal sequencing

274

despite strong RBD-directed serum binding suggests limitations on SARS-CoV-2 escape from

275

polyclonal responses, perhaps especially in genome regions less tolerant of indel mutations (9).

276

Nevertheless, recent findings made with spike variants from second wave pandemic spread

277

demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 can sometimes overcome genetic barriers to broader immune

278

escape (27-30). At the same time, the diversity of clinical outcomes in COVID-19 may relate in

279

part to control of the virus, with slower virologic clearance linked to disease severity (25, 31-33).

280

It will be important to examine whether this reflects a “tipping point” in early infection at which

281

SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity can occasionally allow sustained replication through the evasion

282

of immune recognition. Immunity induced by prior infection, vaccination, or passive

283

immunization could reduce the potential for escape by controlling initial levels of virus

284

replication quickly. Our results also emphasize that early antiviral therapy or combinations of

285

antivirals with distinct targets could have markedly higher virologic efficacy than monotherapy

286

administered later in the disease course.

Ethics Statement

289

Individuals admitted as hospital inpatients at the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)

290

Clinical Center who had positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled consecutively for

291

combined virological and immunological analysis during the period of March-May 2020 (S1

310

Extracted RNA from the 4th Vero cell passage of the SARS-CoV-2 WA-1 clinical isolate was

311

obtained from the BEI Resource (catalog #NR-52285). Nasopharygneal or oropharyngeal swabs

312

from study participants were collected in viral transport medium and cryopreserved until

313

processing for HT-SGS or SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification.

314

SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification

315

Total RNA was extracted from oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swab specimens using the

316

QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) according to the

317

manufacturer’s protocols. The QX200 AutoDG Droplet Digital PCR System (Bio-Rad, Hercules,

318

CA, USA) was used to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 RNA using the SARS-CoV-2 Droplet

319

Digital PCR Kit (Bio-Rad), which contains a triplex assay of primers/probes aligned to the CDC

320

markers for SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 genes and human RPP30 gene. 96-well plates were

321

prepared with technical replicates containing 5.5 µL RNA per well. Microdroplet generation was

322

performed on the QX200 Automated Droplet Generator (Bio-Rad), and plates were sealed with

323

the PX1 PCR Plate Sealer (Bio-Rad) before proceeding with RT-PCR on the C1000 Touch

324

Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plates were read on the

325

QX200 Droplet Reader (Bio-Rad) and analyzed using the freely available QuantaSoft Analysis

326

Pro Software (Bio-Rad) to quantify copies of N1, N2, and RP genes per well, which was then

327

normalized to mL of sample input.

HT-SGS Sample Preparation and Sequencing

329

Nasopharygneal or oropharyngeal swab fluids were thawed and centrifuged at 1,150 x g for 15

min at room temperature to pellet cells and debris. Supernatants were transferred to separate

331

tubes, and supernatant and pellet fractions were processed in parallel, although SGS derived

332

from these two fractions were subsequently found to be similar and were thus pooled for each

333

sample in the final analysis. Nucleic acids were extracted from supernatants and pellets using the

334

QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (52906, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

335

Sample RNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScriptTM IV Reverse Transcriptase (18090010,

336

ThermoFisher Scientific) using a reverse transcription (RT) primer binding within the SARS-

337

CoV-2 ORF6 gene (TCTCCATTGGTTGCTCTTCATCT, WA-1 reference positions 27,357-

338

27,379). The RT primer also included an 8-base UMI (NNNNNNNN) and an outer reverse

339

primer binding site for PCR amplification (CCGCTCCGTCCGACGACTCACTATA; see S1 Fig

340

and S1 Table). Virus cDNA was treated with proteinase K for 25 min at 55°C with continuous

341

shaking to remove residual protein (35), followed by purification with a 2.2:1 volumetric ratio of

342

RNAClean XP solid phase reverse immobilization (SPRI) beads (A63987, Beckman Coulter).

343

Copy numbers of resulting cDNAs were determined by limiting-dilution PCR using

344

fluorescence-assisted clonal amplification (FCA) (36) and a gene-specific primer pair detecting a

345

region upstream of the S gene (S2 Table). Subsequently, cDNA molecules were amplified using

346

the Advantage 2 PCR kit (639206, Takara Bio) with initial denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min,

347

followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 sec, annealing at 64 °C for 30 sec, and

348

extension at 68 °C for 7 min, followed by one final extension at 68 °C for 10 min. Each PCR

349

reaction was run in a 20 µL volume with final primer concentration of 400 nM. Primers included

350

the outer reverse primer and one of two different forward primers (S2 Table). Amplified DNA

351

was quantified on a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermofisher Scientific) and analyzed by

352

electrophoresis with precast 1% agarose gel (Embi Tec) or the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA kit

353

(5067-4626, Agilent). Amplified DNA products spanning the 6.1-kilobase virion surface protein

354

gene region of SARS-CoV-2 with single-genome UMI-based tagging were incorporated into

sequencing libraries using the SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit 2.0 (100-938-900, Pacific

357

sample multiplexing. Libraries were prepared for sequencing by primer annealing and

358

polymerase binding using the Sequel II Binding Kit 2.0 and Int Ctrl 1.0 (101-842-900, Pacific

359

360

Sequel II system 2.0 (Pacific Biosciences) with a 30-hour movie time under circular consensus

361

sequencing (CCS) mode.

362

HT-SGS Initial Data Processing

363

Circular consensus sequences (CCS) were generated from SMRT sequencing data with

364

minimum predicted accuracy of 0.99 and minimum number of passes of 3 in Pacific Biosciences

365

SMRT Link (v8.0) using Arrow modeling framework (37). CCS reads were then demultiplexed

366

using Pacific Biosciences barcode demultiplexer (lima) to identify barcode sequences. The

367

resulting FASTA files were reoriented into 5’-3’ direction using the usearch -orient command in

368

USEARCH (v8.1.1861) (38). Cutadapt (v2.7) (39) was used to trim forward and reverse primers.

369

Length filtering was performed to remove reads shorter than 90% or longer than 130% of the

370

reference sequence length. Appropriately-sized reads were then binned using 8-base UMI

371

sequences. The read count in each UMI bin was plotted against the rank of that UMI bin (on log

372

scale) within the sample, and the inflection point (i.e., point of concavity change) was calculated

373

(S2B Fig). UMI bins with read counts less than the inflection point were discarded, leaving UMI

374

bins with higher counts. Cutadapt (v2.7) was used to remove the RT primer and UMI sequences

375

from each UMI bin consensus to obtain the SARS-CoV-2 insert sequence for that bin. Consensus

376

sequences were generated for each bin using the usearch-cluster_fast command based on 99%

377

identity to obtain high-confidence single-molecule sequences. Consensus sequences were then

were discarded.

380

Determining SGS in HT-SGS Data

381

The probability that two independent UMI sequences differ by a single nucleotide substitution

382

(i.e., have an edit distance of 1 base) can be estimated using binomial distribution with

383

parameters

384

probability that a base differs between two UMIs. Therefore, the probability of any two

385

independent UMIs having edit distance one is

386

to assume that two UMI sequences having edit distance 1 could represent a scenario where one

387

of the UMIs is derived from the other through PCR and/or sequencing error. To identify and

388

remove potential false UMI bins, we utilized a UMI network method (40). In this network, each

389

UMI sequence is represented by a node. Given two distinct nodes  and  with read counts

390

and  , respectively (assume

391

distance 1 and satisfy the following count criterion:

392

formed above, we applied the adjacency method (40). According to this method, the node with

393

the largest count was selected and all connected nodes were removed. Next, the node with the

394

second largest count was selected and all connected nodes were removed. This process was

395

repeated until no more edges remained in the network. The adjacency method allowed resolution

396

of a complex network to a single node. To further reduce the likelihood of including false UMI

397

bins in downstream analysis, we combined our network adjacency approach with a “knee point”

398

(the point of maximum curvature) filter (S2C Fig) to ensure that UMIs with large total counts

399

were preserved. Inflection and knee points can both be considered as separations between the

400

high and low count UMI bins, and both depend on the shape of the count distribution. The knee

401

point is more conservative in comparison to the inflection point. We used the knee rather than

402

the inflection point at this stage in order to provide a more stringent threshold for removing false

403

bins. To identify virus haplotypes defined by the data, we took the consensus sequences of all

404

UMI bins and collapsed non-unique sequences. We considered the unique sequences bearing

405

different combination of mutations as individual haplotypes. Finally, we manually inspected

406

alignments of remaining UMI bin consensus sequences and removed any sequence that

407

represented a SARS-CoV-2 haplotype observed in only one UMI bin for the sample in which it

408

was found.

409

UMI Collision Estimates

410

We investigated the possibility of UMI collision (two distinct molecules labeled with the same

411

UMI) based on the assumption of uniformly distributed UMIs. As described by Fu et al. (41), the

412


expected number of unique UMIs captured is k = 1    ⁄  , where n is the number of

413

molecules and m is the size of UMI pool. Therefore,

414

observed unique UMIs in a particular sample and UMI pool of size 4  65000 , we estimated

415

the number of molecules and calculated the number of UMI collisions, (n-k), for each sample.

416

This number was observed to be small, and the probability of collision in each sample was at

417

most 4%, with an average 1.8% across all samples. We also note that, in the event of a UMI

418

collision between two distinct sequences, the clustering and consensus formation for each UMI

419

bin described above and in S2 Fig results in preservation of the sequence cluster with higher read

420

abundance and removal of the sequence cluster with lower read abundance.

422

Despite high single molecule read accuracy (>99.9%) of Pacific Bioscience HiFi reads, some

423

sequencing errors – particularly small insertions and deletions – may persist in the reads after

424

applying CCS read correction. These errors and those that may arise during RNA reverse

425

transcription may not be identified by our extensive UMI-based error correction method. To

426

distinguish such errors from real biological variation, we used ‘Map Long reads to reference’

427

tool in ‘Long read support’ plugin in the CLC Genomics Workbench v.20.0.4 (GWB) with

428

default settings. This tool utilizes Minimap2 to map long reads (42). We used the WA-1

429

reference sequence (GenBank accession: MN985325.1) as a reference during mapping. We

430

employed the Low Frequency variant caller in the GWB with the following settings:

431

Ignore broken pairs= None

432

Minimum coverage = 5

433

Minimum count = 4

434

Minimum frequency (%) = 0.0

435
436

We also applied a filtering criterion to remove variants in homopolymer regions with minimum

437

length of 2 and a frequency less than or equal to 20%. We did not consider quality or direction

438

and position filters typically used in analyzing paired-end, short-read data as these do not apply

439

to long-read amplicon sequencing. We then manually inspected the mutation list to remove

440

presumptive artifacts that were missed by the variant callers. The positions identified in our high-

441

confidence variants list were then masked in the read mapping and bases in all other positions

442

were reverted to the reference base, where applicable, using an in-house python script.

ectodomain containing 2 proline stabilization mutations (S-2P) (43) were performed using a

446

fortéBio Octet HTX instrument and His1K (anti-penta His) biosensors at 30°C with agitation set

447

to 1,000 rpm. Biosensors were first equilibrated for 600 seconds in PBS supplemented with 1%

448

BSA, 0.01% Tween-20, and 0.02% sodium azide (PBS-BSA). Purified S-2P (10 µg/mL in PBS-

449

BSA) was immobilized on equilibrated His1K sensors for 600 s. S-2P protein loading onto to the

450

sensors was between 0.9 and 1.3 nm shift. Following S-2P immobilization, biosensors were

451

equilibrated in PBS-BSA for 60 s. S-2P coated biosensors were submerged in either S-2P

452

binding-domain specific competitor monoclonal antibodies (mAb) or negative control antibody,

453

each at 10 µg/mL in PBS-BSA, for 600 s. At 600 s, the binding of all S-2P binding antibodies

454

was saturating. Competitor mAbs were divided into three separate groups, each targeting a

455

binding domain of S-2P: RBD, NTD, and S2 domain. Monoclonal antibodies included were

456

composed of human IgG RBD-specific antibodies LY-CoV-555 (44), S309 (45), CR3022 (46),

457

and CB6 (47), NTD-specific antibodies S652-118 (48), 4-8 (49) and 4A8 (24) and S2-specific

458

antibody S652-112 (48). Following saturating competitor mAb association, biosensors were

459

equilibrated in PBS-BSA for 60 s and then submerged in serum samples diluted 100-fold in

460

PBS-BSA for 3600 s. Raw sensorgrams datapoints were aligned to Y (nm) = 0 in at the

serum samples reached saturation (4001.2 s). Pie charts depict each binding domain’s relative

(A) SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA (gRNA) is reverse-transcribed to include an 8-nucleotide

500

unique molecular identifier (UMI; multicolored bar), followed by PCR amplification and Pacific

501

Biosciences single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing of the 6.1-kilobase region

502

encompassing spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), and membrane (M) protein genes. After quality

503

control and trimming, sequence reads are compiled into bins that share a UMI sequence, and bins

504

with low read counts are removed according to the inflection point of the read count distribution

505

(see S2B Fig). Presumptive false bins arising from errors in the UMI are then identified and

506

removed by the network adjacency method, followed by further removal of bins with the lowest

507

read counts using a more conservative knee point cutoff (see S2C Fig). Variant calling is then

508

used to identify presumptive erroneous mutations based on rarity and pattern (ex., single-base

509

insertions adjacent to homopolymers), and these are reverted to the sample consensus. Finally,

510

SGS that correspond to haplotypes occurring only once in each sample are excluded (not

511

pictured). (B) To validate data generation and analysis procedures, clonal RNAs transcribed in

512

vitro from USA/WA-1 and double mutant sequences were mixed at varying ratios and subjected

513

to HT-SGS. Results are described in Results and Table I.
