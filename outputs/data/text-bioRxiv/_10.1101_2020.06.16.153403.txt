Abstract:
The ongoing pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), necessitates strategies to identify prophylactic and therapeutic drug candidates for rapid clinical
deployment. A high-throughput, high-content imaging assay of human HeLa cells expressing the SARSCoV-2 receptor ACE2 was used to screen ReFRAME, a best-in-class drug repurposing library. From
nearly 12,000 compounds, we identified 66 compounds capable of selectively inhibiting SARS-CoV-2
replication in human cells. Twenty-four of these drugs show additive activity in combination with the
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor remdesivir and may afford increased in vivo efficacy. We
also identified synergistic interaction of the nucleoside analog riboprine and a folate antagonist 10deazaaminopterin with remdesivir. Overall, seven clinically approved drugs (halofantrine, amiodarone,
nelfinavir, simeprevir, manidipine, ozanimod, osimertinib) and 19 compounds in other stages of
development may have the potential to be repurposed as SARS-CoV-2 oral therapeutics based on their
potency, pharmacokinetic and human safety profiles.

Main Text:
In early December of 2019 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
was identified as the cause of rapidly increasing numbers of severe pneumonia-like symptoms termed
COVID-19 1. Since then, SARS-CoV-2 has rightfully been given its pandemic status by the World
Health Organization (WHO). As of May 4, SARS-CoV-2 has spread throughout the world causing a
combined total of more than 3,407,000 confirmed infections and more than 238,000 reported deaths in
215 different countries 2. Antiviral treatment options for COVID-19 are extremely limited. Many
compounds, such as ribavirin, interferon, lopinavir-ritonavir, and corticosteroids that had been used in

patients with SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, remain unvalidated for the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 3.
Remdesivir, a nucleotide analog prodrug with broad antiviral activity that works as an RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase inhibitor, has been reported to be effective against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1
infections in animal models 4-6. Repositioning of remdesivir as a treatment against SARS-CoV-2
infection has recently demonstrated positive clinical endpoints in a Phase 3 Adaptive COVID-19
Treatment Trial (median time to recovery shortened from 15 to 11 days) 7 that justified emergency use
authorization of remdesivir by the US Food & Drug Administration for treatment of hospitalized
COVID-19 patients 8. The effectiveness of the repurposed drug remdesivir, with the current formulation
requiring administration by IV infusion, both highlights the importance of investigating pre-existing
drugs to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections, and the need for discovery of new or supplemental therapies
that result in greater clinical improvements and can be administered outside of a hospital setting (i.e.
orally). The ReFRAME (Repurposing, Focused Rescue, and Accelerated Medchem) drug collection is
an extensive drug repurposing library containing nearly 12,000 small-molecule drugs shown to be
appropriate for direct use in humans 9 and provides a rich resource to discover new treatments that may
be used as additional monotherapies or even in combination with remdesivir to further enhance efficacy
and reduce drug resistance potential.
High-throughput cell-based phenotypic assay against SARS-CoV-2
To identify compounds that could inhibit entry or replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human cells, we
developed a high-content imaging (HCI) 384-well format assay using HeLa cells expressing the human
SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, or ACE2 (HeLa-ACE2). In this assay
HeLa-ACE2 cells are infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus in the presence of compounds of interest, and
viral infection is quantified 24 hours later (Fig. 1A). The assay relies on immunofluorescent detection of
SARS-CoV-2 proteins with sera purified from patients exposed to the virus, which together with host
cell nuclear staining allows for quantification of the percent infected cells in each well (Fig. 1B).
We validated the assay using compounds with reported activity against Ebola and suspected or
previously verified activity against SARS-CoV-2: remdesivir (GS-5734) 10 (EC50 = 194 ± 20 nM;
average ± sem of 5 independent experiments) and the PIKfyve inhibitor apilimod (EC50 = 50 ± 11 nM,
average ± sem of 4 independent experiments) (Fig. 1B). Remdesivir at elevated concentrations was able
to eliminate infected cells almost completely (Fig. 1C) and we used it at a concentration of 2.5 µM as a
positive control, with data normalized to it and neutral DMSO control wells. While apilimod was more
potent than remdesivir, it had a fractionally lower maximal efficacy (85-90% of uninfected cells at the
highest effective concentrations) compared to remdesivir. Additionally, we assessed compound toxicity
in the context of infection by quantifying the total cell numbers per well, with cytotoxic protein
synthesis inhibitor puromycin as a positive control (average EC50 = 547 ± 27 nM, average ± sem of 5
independent experiments; HeLa-ACE2 CC50 = 2.45 ± 0.23 µM, average ± sem of 5 independent
experiments). Notably, a concomitant increase in cell numbers coincided with the antiviral activity of
remdesivir and apilimod, likely due to reduction in proliferation of infected cells (Fig. 1B-E). Altering
the multiplicity of infection had modest effects on the potency of control compounds in the same
experiment, with a 2.7-fold increase in remdesivir’s EC50 from MOI=1 to MOI=26, and a 3.7-fold
increase in apilimod’s EC50, but not that of puromycin (Fig. S1).
Using the developed assay, we ran a pilot screen to assess the activity of 148 small molecules
with suspected therapeutic potential against coronavirus infections mined from the available literature 11
(RZ’ = 0.84). We identified 19 compounds with an EC50 < 9.6 µM and, based on data obtained from an
uninfected HeLa-ACE2 24-hour live/dead assay, 10 of these were selective (uninfected HeLa-ACE2

CC50/SARS-CoV-2 EC50 > 10 or uninfected HeLa-ACE2 CC50 > 40 µM) (Table S1). This included
library/screening lots of apilimod (EC50 = 184 nM, CC50 > 40 µM) and remdesivir (EC50 = 300 nM CC50
> 40 µM) that were “rediscovered” in the assay. The higher EC50 of apilimod and remdesivir are likely
due to slight degradation over time in the screening deck compared to freshly prepared control powder
stock.
Screening ReFRAME, a best-in-class drug repurposing library
Next, we screened the 12,000-compound ReFRAME repurposing library at a final concentration
of 1.9 µM and 9.6 µM. Assay quality was maintained throughout both screens (RZ’ of 0.87 and 0.72,
respectively) (Table 1) and a clear distinction was apparent in the activity profiles of DMSO vehicle(neutral control), remdesivir- (positive control), apilimod-, and puromycin- (toxicity control)-treated
wells (Fig. 1D, 1E). Hits were selected based on demonstration of >50% reduction in the number of
infected cells per well (<-50% activity normalized to neutral controls minus inhibitors) and <40%
toxicity based on the total cell number per well (>-40% activity normalized to compound activities,
including 10 µM puromycin) (Fig, 1E, 1F) identifying 61 primary hits at 1.9 µM and 266 primary hits at
9.6 µM screening concentrations (hit rates of 0.51 and 2.24%, respectively), with a total of 311 hits.
The hit rate for the primary screen of the ReFRAME library was high (2.75%), but not
unexpected for this collection of bioactive small molecules, many of which are approved drugs or in
clinical phases of development and used for a wide assortment of indications (Fig. 2A). To reconfirm
and assess potency and selectivity of the primary hits we tested 310 of the available compounds in a 10point 1:3 dilution dose response format with a top concentration of 9.6 µM. Of these, 225 (72.6%)
demonstrated activity with EC50 < 9.6 µM against SARS-CoV-2. However, many of the primary screen
hits were also cytotoxic, with an unacceptably low selectivity ratio as determined in uninfected HeLaACE2 cells (uninfected CC50/EC50 < 10) (Table 2, Fig. 2B). Because viruses rely on host machinery for
replication, it was not unexpected that many of the compounds with antiviral activity also affected vital
host processes. Interestingly, this toxicity was sometimes masked in infected cells, as reduction of viral
infection by compounds like the protein synthesis inhibitor puromycin and even hydroxychloroquine
provided a benefit to cell health in the context of infection but not in uninfected cells (Fig. 2C, Table
S1).
Between the small pilot and the ReFRAME screen, and not including remdesivir, we identified
67 (66 unique as two different lots of GW-803430 were identified) potent (EC50 < 9.6 µM) and selective
(CC50/EC50 >10 or CC50 > 39.8 µM) compounds (Fig. 2B, D, Table S1). The top four classes of potent
and selective compounds were oncolytic compounds, ion channel modulators, anti-psychotics and
receptor binding compounds (Fig. 2D). A fifth of potent and selective hits could be classified as
oncolytic drugs, further reflecting the reliance of the virus on host cell processes present in rapidly
proliferating cells. The identification of compounds belonging to anti-psychotic, cardiovascular, and
even anti-parasitic (neglected tropical diseases) classes may reflect the cationic amphiphilic nature of
some of these molecules and their ability to accumulate in and impact acidic intracellular compartments
(e.g. late endosomes/lysosomes). Resultant dysregulation of the endo-lysosomal pathway and lipid
homeostasis has been suggested to impair viral entry and/or replication 12 and this mode of action has
been speculated for amiodarone and hydroxychloroquine, both identified here as potent and selective
hits against SARS-CoV-2 in our screen (Table 2, Table S1). We also identified two selective estrogen
receptor modulators (bazedoxifene, EC50 = 3.47 µM and raloxifene EC50 = 4.13 µM); a class of
compounds previously found to inhibit Ebola virus infection 13.

Out of the identified hits, of highest interest were the newly identified approved oral drugs
halofantrine HCl, amiodarone, nelfinavir mesylate, simperevir, manidipine, ozanimod andosimertinib,
due to their relatively high exposures or a long history of use as therapeutic agents and therefore
potential to be quickly repurposed as COVID-19 treatments following further efficacy vetting in animal
models. The viral protease inhibitors nelfinavir and simeprevir have good exposures and based on their
described mode of action we speculate that they inhibit SARS-CoV-2 directly. The selective
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P1) receptor modulator ozanimod is also intriguing as a potential COVID19 therapy. Selective S1P1 agonists have been shown to provide significant protection against influenza
virus infection in murine models by reducing inflammation at the site of infection (reducing release of
cytokines by pulmonary endothelial cells and infiltration of lymphocytes into the lungs) 14, and thus
ozanimod may serve as a good combination partner for a direct-acting antiviral drug. The approved
calcium-channel blocker manidipine has low exposure but may have the potential to improve COVID19 disease outcomes for patients. Interestingly, amiodarone has previously been identified as having
broad-spectrum antiviral activity in an in vitro screen 15. Nineteen other compounds in various stages of
development such as apilimod (assay control that may inhibit viral entry through disruption of endolysosomal trafficking, as found for filoviruses16), the protease inhibitors NCO 700 (cathepsin B) and
dutacatib (cathepsin K), which may also impact viral entry, all have the potential to show efficacy due to
their potency or pharmacokinetic profiles (Table 2). Most of these, except for the very potent apilimod,
had modest EC50s > 1 µM that did not surpass the potency of remdesivir. However, remdesivir’s
requirement for intravenous administration and potentially limited efficacy warrants further
investigation into alternative or supplemental therapies. Therefore, we investigated whether the hits
identified in our screen would be suitable as partners for a combination therapy with remdesivir.
Combination therapies
Combination therapies have the potential to increase efficacy of treatment while reducing drug
dose of either or both combinations partners, and thus prevent side effects that may be associated with
administration of higher doses. Drug combinations can also slow the acquisition of drug resistance. Drug
synergy, the increase in activity of the combination therapy beyond what is expected of an additive
interaction is rare, yet additive effects themselves have the potential to improve therapy regimens.
Conversely, antagonism, the inhibition of activity of the overall combination beyond what would be
expected if the compounds acted independently, is an undesirable property. To identify synergistic,
additive, and antagonistic interactions between remdesivir and ReFRAME hits, we performed synergy
interactions studies in a checkerboard experiment, comparing full dose response of remdesivir against
the dose responses of 24 hits with attractive safety and pharmacokinetic profiles in a 10 × 10 matrix
(Fig. 2E). We used the synergyfinder package 17 in R to assess the interactions between the tested
compounds using the Zero Interaction Potency Model (ZIP) 18, where a δ score > 10 indicates likely
synergy, δ < -10 indicates antagonism, and δ between -10 and 10 suggests an additive interaction. We
found no genuine synergy between remdesivir and the compounds tested; however, the combinations
were additive, including that of nelfinavir with remdesivir (Fig. 3A, Table 1, Table S1), suggesting these
drugs, if they were to prove efficacious in vivo, could potentially be co-administered with remdesivir to
increase the overall safety and efficacy of treatment, while limiting the evolution of drug resistance.
To identify compounds that interact synergistically with remdesivir we carried out a second
unbiased ReFRAME screen in the presence of low concentrations (80 nM) of remdesivir. The activity of
novel hits from this screen were assessed in the presence and absence of remdesivir. Based on a
perceived shift in activity in the presence of remdesivir, compounds were tested in a checkerboard

synergy matrix and we identified the nucleoside analog riboprine (N6-isopentenyladenosine, previously
investigated as an antineoplastic agent, for treatment of nausea and surgical site infections, and a
component of CitraNatal 90 DHA, a prescription prenatal/postnatal multivitamin/mineral tablet) and a
folate antagonist 10-deazaaminopterin (an antineoplastic compound currently in Phase II stage of
development) as having activities that synergized with those of remdesivir. The synergistic effects for
both compounds were observed across specific concentrations, signified as peaks within the 3dimensional synergy score landscape (Figure 3B, 3C), prompting closer scrutiny of activity of each
compound. Riboprine achieved maximal (100%) efficacy over the range of concentrations tested, but
addition of EC2 of remdesivir shifted its EC50 from 12 µM to 3.6 µM, and addition of EC24 of remdesivir
increased its potency further to EC50 = 1.6 µM (Figure 3B). 10-deazaaminopterin showed only 40%
maximal efficacy over the range of concentrations tested, but the addition of EC2 of remdesivir caused
an increase of maximal efficacy from 40% to nearly 65% (where a shift of 2% would be expected) and
addition of EC24 of remdesivir increased maximal efficacy of the combination from 40% to >80%
(Figure 3C). The mechanism of action behind the observed synergies remains to be determined.
Riboprine has been reported to block uridine and cytidine import19 and through inhibition of protein
prenylation to inhibit autophagy20 which could impact RNA catabolism21 whereas 10-deazaaminopterin
has been suggested to inhibit folate dependent enzymes of the purine biosynthesis pathway19-22.
Therefore, treatment with either riboprine or 10-deazaminopterin may result in reduced intracellular
nucleoside pools and in this way synergize with RdRp inhibition by the adenosine nucleoside analog
remdesivir. However, another or more direct and specific interaction cannot be excluded and remains to
be elucidated. While these findings indicate a promising avenue for further investigation of combination
therapies for treatment of COVID-19, the adverse effects of these agents (e.g. inhibition of immunity by
10-deazaaminopterin) would need to be carefully considered in the design and dose selection of in vivo
validation experiments.
In summary, by screening the high-value repurposing ReFRAME library we identified 75 unique
known drugs or preclinical molecules with activity against SARS-CoV-2 in human cells, 24 of which
were tested and showed an additive interaction in combination with the antiviral compound remdesivir
recently granted emergency approval for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also identified a
synergistic interaction between remdesivir and both 10-deazaaminopterin and riboprine. Our data
support the advancement of the identified compounds for further profiling in in vivo models to assess
their utility (alone or in combination with remdesivir) in combating the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods
Virus generation
Vero E6 cells (ATCC CRL-1586) were plated in a T225 flask with complete DMEM (Corning 15-013CV) containing 10% FBS, 1×PenStrep (Corning 20-002-CL), 2 mM L-Glutamine (Corning 25-005-CL)
overnight at 37 5% CO2. The media in the flask was removed and 2 mL of SARS-CoV-2 strain USAWA1/2020 (BEI Resources NR-52281) in complete DMEM was added to the flask at an MOI of 0.5 and
was allowed to incubate for 30 minutes at 34 5% CO2. After incubation, 30 mL of complete DMEM
was added to the flask. The flask was then placed in a 34 incubator at 5% CO2 for 5 days. On day 5
post infection the supernatant was harvested and centrifuged at 1,000×g for 5 minutes. The supernatant
was filtered through a 0.22 µM filter and stored at -80 .

The ReFRAME library collection consists of nearly 12,000 high-purity compounds (>95%) dissolved in
high-quality dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Compound quality control was performed by liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry and/or 1H-NMR when required. The library was prepared at two
concentrations, 2 and 10 mM, to support low-concentration (2–10 µM) and high-concentration (10–50
µM) screening formats. Echo-qualified 384-well low dead volume plus microplates (LP-0200-BC;
Labcyte Inc.) were used as the library source plates to support acoustic transfer with an Echo 555 Liquid
Handler (Labcyte Inc.). Compounds not soluble in DMSO were plated in water (129 compounds);
compounds lacking long-term solubility in DMSO were suspended just before dispensing to avoid
precipitation (71 compounds). Additional details available at https://reframedb.org/about.
Associated compound annotation are supported by three widely used commercial drug competitive
intelligence databases: Clarivate Integrity, GVK Excelra GoStar, and Citeline Pharmaprojects. As
available, annotation data may include status of clinical development and highest stage of development
achieved, mechanism of action, drug indication(s), and route of administration.
In accordance with ReFRAME data policies, open access to these data are assured and have been
expedited for immediate disclosure at https://reframedb.org/.
HeLa-ACE2 stable cell line
HeLa-ACE2 cells were generated through transduction of human ACE2 lentivirus. The lentivirus was
created by co-transfection of HEK293T cells with pBOB-hACE2 construct and lentiviral packaging
plasmids pMDL, pREV, and pVSV-G (Addgene) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
11668019). Supernatant was collected 48 h after transfection then used to transduce pre-seeded HeLa
cells. 12 h after transduction stable cell lines were collected, scaled up and stored. Cells were maintained
in DMEM (Gibco, 11965-092) with 10% FBS (Gibco, 10438026) and 1× sodium pyruvate (Gibco,
11360070) at 37 5% CO2.
SARS-CoV-2/HeLa-ACE2 high-content screening assay
Compounds were acoustically transferred into 384-well µclear-bottom plates (Greiner, Part. No.
781090-2B). HeLa-ACE2 cells were seeded in 13 µL DMEM with 2% FBS at a density of 1.0×103 cells
per well. Plated cells were transported to the BSL3 facility where 13 µL of SARS-CoV-2 diluted in
assay media was added per well at a concentration of 2.0×106 PFU/mL (assay multiplicity of infection
(MOI) = 2.2). Plates were incubated for 24 h at 34 5% CO2, and then fixed with 25 µL of 8%
formaldehyde for 1 h at 34 5% CO2. Plates were washed with 1xPBS 0.05% Tween 20 in between
fixation and subsequent primary and secondary antibody staining. Human polyclonal sera diluted 1:500
in Perm/Wash buffer (BD Biosciences 554723) was added to the plate and incubated at RT for 2 h. Six
µg/mL of goat anti-human H+L conjugated Alexa 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific A11013) together with
8 µM of antifade-46-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Thermo Fisher Scientific D1306) in SuperBlock
T20 (PBS) buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific 37515) was added to the plate and incubated at RT for 1 h
in the dark. Plates were imaged using the ImageXpress Micro Confocal High-Content Imaging System
(Molecular Devices) with a 10× objective, with 4 fields imaged per well. Images were analyzed using
the Multi-Wavelength Cell Scoring Application Module (MetaXpress), with DAPI staining identifying
the host-cell nuclei (the total number of cells in the images) and the SARS-CoV-2 immunofluorescence
signal leading to identification of infected cells.

Compounds were acoustically transferred into 1,536-well µclear plates (Greiner Part. No. 789091).
HeLa-ACE2 cells were maintained as described for the infection assay and seeded in the assay-ready
plates at 400 cells/well in DMEM with 2% FBS and plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37 5% CO2.
To assess cell viability, the Image-iT DEAD green reagent (Thermo Fisher) was used according to
manufacturer instructions. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and counterstained with DAPI.
Fixed cells were imaged using the ImageXpress Micro Confocal High-Content Imaging System
(Molecular Devices) with a 10× objective, and total live cells per well quantified in the acquired images
using the Live Dead Application Module (MetaXpress).
Data analysis
Image analysis was carried out with MetaXpress (version 6.5.4.532). Primary in vitro screen and the
host cell cytotoxicity counter screen data were uploaded to Genedata Screener, Version 16.0.3-Standard.
Data were normalized to neutral (DMSO) minus inhibitor controls (2.5 µM remdesivir for antiviral
effect and 10 µM puromycin for infected host cell toxicity). For the uninfected host cell cytotoxicity
counter screen 40 µM puromycin (Sigma) was used as the positive control. For dose response
experiments compounds were tested in technical triplicates on different assay plates and dose curves
were fitted with the four parameter Hill Equation. Technical replicate data were analyzed using median
condensing. The synergyfinder package17 in R (version 3.6.3) was used for synergy analysis.
Data availability
All data are available in the main text or the supplementary materials. Results from the screen of the
ReFRAME library have been deposited to the reframedb.org data portal.
