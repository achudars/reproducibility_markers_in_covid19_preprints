Abstract

38

SARS-CoV-2 infection induces a T cell response that most likely contributes to virus control

39

in COVID-19 patients, but may also induce immunopathology. Until now, the cytotoxic T cell

40

response has not been very well characterized in COVID-19 patients.

41

Here, we analyzed the differentiation and cytotoxic profile of T cells in 30 cases of mild

42

COVID-19 during acute infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced a cytotoxic response of

43

CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, characterized by the simultaneous production of

44

granzyme A and B, as well as perforin within different effector CD8+ T cell subsets. PD-1

45

expressing CD8+ T cells also produced cytotoxic molecules during acute infection indicating

46

that they were not functionally exhausted. However, in COVID-19 patients over the age of 80

47

years the cytotoxic T cell potential was diminished, especially in effector memory and

48

terminally differentiated effector CD8+ cells, showing that elderly patients have impaired

49

cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2.

50

Our data provides valuable information about T cell responses in COVID-19 patients that

51

may also have important implications for vaccine development.

52
53

Importance

54

Cytotoxic T cells are responsible for the elimination of infected cells and are key players for

55

the control of viruses. CD8+ T cells with an effector phenotype express cytotoxic molecules

56

and are able to perform target cell killing. COVID-19 patients with a mild disease course were

57

analyzed for the differentiation status and cytotoxic profile of CD8+ T cells. SARS-CoV-2

58

infection induced a vigorous cytotoxic CD8+ T cell response. However, this cytotoxic profile

59

of T cells was not detected in COVID-19 patients over the age of 80 years. Thus, the

60

absence of a cytotoxic response in elderly patients might be a possible reason for the more

61

frequent severity of COVID-19 in this age group in comparison to younger patients.

Introduction

63

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly virulent

64

sarbecovirus currently causing a global pandemic with millions of cases and hundred

65

thousands of fatalities. Virus replication in the lung epithelium and the corresponding

66

pneumonia are the main reasons for symptomatic COVID-19 cases, although other tissues

67

and organs such as the kidney are also affected (1). Elderly people are predisposed to

68

severe COVID-19 and the mortality increases dramatically with age (1-3) . In particular,

69

individuals over 80 years of age show the highest hazard ratio (8.93-13.77) in terms of

70

hospital admissions (1) and have the highest case fatality rate (4).

71

There is growing evidence that adaptive immune responses are necessary for the control

72

and subsequent elimination of the virus (5). Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are a specialized

73

population of immune cells which is able to selectively kill infected cells and consequently

74

eliminate viruses. Usually, CD8+ T lymphocytes mediate adaptive cytotoxic T cell responses.

75

Additionally, a fraction of the CD4+ T cell population is able to differentiate into cells with

76

cytotoxic properties (6). Both populations of cytotoxic cells can contribute to virus control by

77

eliminating infected cells. T cells responding to viral antigens expand and differentiate from

78

cells with a naïve phenotype into subpopulations of terminally differentiated cytotoxic effector

79

T cells or cells with an effector memory phenotype. Both effector cell subpopulations are

80

abundant during the acute phase of antiviral immune responses (7). Accordingly, the number

81

of cells with these phenotypes rises during the acute immune responses against several

82

respiratory viral infections (8). The SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a reduction of

83

CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (9, 10). One prominent cause of lymphopenia may be an enhanced

84

migration of T cells into infected compartments (11, 12). Despite the lymphopenia, expanded

85

virus-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells can be detected in COVID-19 patients (13, 14). The

86

CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are specific towards several proteins of SARS-CoV-2 as has been

87

recently shown (15-17). During the early phase of the immune response, CD8+ and CD4+ T

88

cells reacted against the spike, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins (15, 16). The T

89

lymphocytes of convalescent patients responded to structural proteins or nonstructural

90

proteins which provides evidence of the development of memory to different viral proteins

91

after infection (17, 18). Interestingly, some individuals who were not infected with SARS-

92

CoV-2 also responded to the antigens of this virus which have a low homology with “common

93

cold” human coronaviruses (17, 18).

94

The detection of these virus-specific cells was possible after the in vitro stimulation of T cells

95

with viral peptides. This method allows for the definition of the specificity of analyzed T cells,

96

but has a modulating impact on the T cell phenotype and functionality. Moreover, the

97

stimulation of activated effector T cells in vitro can lead to restimulation-induced cell death

98

(RICD) (19). In our study, we have characterized lymphocytes without any treatment and

99

performed ex vivo multiparameter analyses of T cells.

100

A key mechanism of functional CTLs is the elimination of virus-infected cells through the

101

induction of apoptosis of target cells after cell-to-cell contact with effector CD8+ T cells. To

102

perform cytotoxic functions, CTLs produce and accumulate effector molecules like the serine

103

proteases granzymes (Gzm) and the pore-forming protein perforin in cytotoxic granules.

104

Additionally, the release of Gzms from activated T cells contributes to the development of

105

inflammation in infected organs. Gzms also change the intracellular matrix and support the

106

migration of lymphocytes, while perforin is necessary for the entry of Gzms into target cells.

107

After the formation of an immunological synapse and the degranulation of cytotoxic granules,

108

Gzms enter into target cells where they initiate multiple pathways leading to the cell death of

109

the infected cell, terminating intracellular virus replication through the loss of the host cell.

110

Thus, the expression of different cytotoxic molecules in T cell subpopulations is an important

111

hallmark for the existence of lymphocytes with a cytotoxic potential known to be necessary

112

for virus control (20). Besides their beneficial role, the elimination of virus-infected cells by

113

cytotoxic T cells can also be associated with a damage of infected organs resulting in severe

114

immunopathology. Therefore, they are tightly controlled by multiple checkpoints of the

115

immune system (21). Accordingly, the contribution of T cells to the pathology seen in COVID-

116

19

117

Immune senescence is an age-associated change of the immune system related to thymus

118

involution and reduced frequencies of naïve CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (23). The senescent

119

immune system exhibits a reduced plasticity and adaptive effector potential to respond

120

against viral infections (12). In the current study, we characterized the differentiation status of

121

T lymphocytes and their production of cytotoxic molecules in 30 COVID-19 patients with a

122

mild disease course. CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, developed a cytotoxic phenotype

123

during early SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed reduced frequencies of T cells producing

124

cytotoxic molecules in elderly patients. The ability to simultaneously produce Gzms and

125

perforin was significantly impaired in aged patients.

126

Results

127

To characterize the cytotoxic profile of T cells upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, we analyzed the

128

blood of 30 COVID-19 patients with a mild disease course by multi-parameter flow cytometry.

129

All analyses were performed directly ex vivo from blood cells to determine the in

130

vivo phenotype of T cells in COVID-19 patients excluding changes that are inevitably induced

131

by re-stimulation protocols in vitro. Usually, patients were hospitalized one week after the first

132

onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Most frequently patients were hospitalized due to dyspnea.

134

pneumonia. Nine patients did not need oxygen supplementation, but all others received

135

oxygen during their stay. All patients received empiric antimicrobial treatment except four

136

patients. Four patients were treated additionally with oral Oseltamivir until a negative

137

influenza test was available. The median length of hospitalization was 8 (3-108) days. The

138

median age of patients was high (71 years), consistent with the fact that symptomatic

139

COVID-19 disease and hospital admissions are more prevalent in the elderly. Peripheral

140

blood was drawn immediately after hospitalization to analyze T cell responses during acute

141

infection. The laboratory parameters of the patients are depicted in Table 1 (Sup. Tab. 1). All

142

SARS-CoV-2 infections were unequivocally confirmed by certified diagnostic RT-PCRs.

143
144

CD4+ T cells are not cytotoxic during SARS-CoV-2 infection

145

CD4+ T cells usually function as helper cells, but have been shown to be capable of

146

cytotoxicity after several virus infections, including those with coronaviruses (6, 24).

147

Therefore, we analyzed the production of cytotoxic molecules in CD4+ T cells upon SARS-

148

CoV-2 infection without any additional stimulation of lymphocytes. First, we determined the

149

numbers of CD4+ T cells in the blood of COVID-19 patients and stratified the patients into

150

age groups of 29-79 (median 62) and 80-96 (median 86) years. CD4+ T cell counts were

151

reduced compared to normal clinical references: in the 29-79 age group, the median was 333

152

CD4+ T cells per µl vs. 555-1460 CD4+ T cells per µl in healthy donors, and in the 80-96

153

age group, the median was 319 CD4+ T cells per µl vs 540-720 CD4+ T cells per µl in age-

154

matched control individuals (25) (Fig. 1A). No difference in CD4+ T cell counts between the

155

analyzed age groups was observed. Next, we determined the differentiation status of all

156

CD3+CD4+ T cells according to the expression of CD45RO, CCR7, and CD28 and stratified

157

CD4+ T cells into naïve (N, CD45RO- CCR7+ CD28+), central memory (CM, CD45RO+

158

CCR7+ CD28+), transitional memory (TM, CD45RO+ CCR7- CD28+), effector memory (EM,

159

CD45RO+ CCR7- CD28-), and terminally differentiated effector (E, CD45RO- CCR7- CD28-)

160

subpopulations (Fig. 1B). The gating strategy is shown in Figure S1. Subsequently, we

161

compared the distribution of subpopulations between COVID-19 patients and age-matched

162

healthy controls, again stratified according to age. No obvious differences between COVID-

163

19 patients and healthy controls were found for any of the CD4+ T cell subtypes (Fig. 1C). To

164

characterize their cytotoxic profile, we stained total CD4+ T cells directly ex vivo without re-

165

stimulation for the cytotoxic molecules GzmA, GzmB, and perforin and compared the two

166

age groups between COVID-19 patients and age-matched healthy controls (Fig. 1C-F).

167

Again, we did not find clear differences between groups, except that the frequency of GzmB-

168

producing cells was slightly increased in the 29-79 year group of COVID-19 patients

169

compared to healthy controls, yet with largely overlapping confidence intervals (Fig. 1C, E).

170

Conversely, perforin responses were reduced in the older age group of COVID-19 patients

171

(Fig. 1C, F). The overall data failed to reveal a meaningful cytotoxic response of CD4+ T

172

cells early after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and we did not further analyze CD4+ cells in the

173

current study.

174
175

Expansion of CD8+ T cells with a cytotoxic profile upon SARS-CoV-2 infection

176

CD8+ T cell are also named cytotoxic T cells and constitute the main T cell population that

177

can kill virus-infected cells. Therefore, we analyzed the production of cytotoxic molecules in

178

CD8+ T cells in a cohort of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals.

179

We first determined CD8+ T cell numbers in the blood of COVID-19 patients in the two age

180

groups. CD8+ T cell counts were clearly reduced in both groups compared to the numbers

181

reported in the literature (25), and an additional significant reduction was found for COVID-19

182

patients over 80 years of age (Fig. 2A). When calculating the Pearson correlation, we found

183

an inverse association between CD8+ T cell counts in peripheral blood and patient age (Fig.

184

2B). Next, we determined the distribution of different CD8+ T cell subsets (defined parallel to

185

the criteria for CD4+ T cells described above) and compared COVID-19 patients with age-

186

matched healthy controls, again in two age groups. The gating strategy is shown in Figure

187

S2. Differences were found for the 29-79 year group in which the frequency of naïve CD8+ T

188

cells was clearly reduced in COVID-19 patients, whereas percentages of effector, effector

189

memory, and transitional memory cells were enhanced compared to healthy individuals,

190

suggesting an ongoing CD8+ T cell response in COVID-19 patients (Fig. 2C). Interestingly,

191

this difference was almost absent in the older age group, most likely because the pool of

192

naïve CD8+ T cells largely disappears in elderly individuals (23). To characterize the profile

193

of CD8+ T cells, we stained CD8+ cells for cytotoxic molecules and compared the two age

194

groups from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls (Fig. 3A). Cells were analyzed directly

195

ex vivo without any re-stimulation. We found a significant difference between the patients

196

and controls in the younger age group. COVID-19 patients had higher frequencies of CD8+ T

197

cells producing the cytotoxic molecules GzmA and GzmB as well as perforin compared to

198

healthy controls (Fig. 3A-D). Thus, a clear cytotoxic profile could be detected at an early

199

stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the 80-96 age group, an enhanced production of cytotoxic

200

molecules in CD8+ T cells was not evident after infection, most likely because the CD8+ T

201

cells of elderly non-infected individuals already express high background levels of cytotoxic

202

molecules (23). However, if these cells still mediate cytotoxic functions remains elusive.

203

Some studies on T cell responses in COVID-19 patients reported that CD8+ T cells may

204

already become functionally exhausted during acute infection (26). This hypothesis was

205

based on the analysis of PD-1 expression by T cells during early COVID-19. In functional

206

terms, PD-1, in conjunction with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, exerts potent immune-

207

inhibitory activities. However, its expression is induced by T cell receptor (TCR) activation

208

(27) and TCR downstream NFAT signaling (28). PD-1 expression is a hallmark of recent

209

TCR-based recognition of MHC-presented antigens that is often up-regulated on cytotoxic

210

effector T cells during acute infections (29, 30). We found that about 20% of total CD8+ T

211

cells expressed PD-1 in healthy controls, as well as in COVID-19 patients (Fig. 4A). Most of

212

these cells expressed GzmA with no apparent differences between the groups (Fig. 4B).

213

However, for GzmB and perforin, we found a higher frequency of positive cells among PD-1+

214

CD8+ T cells in the group of younger COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. This

215

difference was absent for the older age group (Fig. 4C, D). Our data indicate that PD-1+

216

CD8+ T cells express cytotoxic molecules and should not be misclassified as functionally

217

exhausted T cells during the early SARS-CoV-2 infection.

218

Here, we clearly demonstrate a cytotoxic profile in CD8+ T cells upon SARS-CoV-2 infection,

219

which was also found in CD8+ T cells expressing PD-1.

220
221

The frequency of CD8+ T cells with a cytotoxic profile in COVID-19 is reduced with

222

patients’ age

223

Individual subpopulations of CD8+ T cells differ in their ability to produce cytotoxic molecules,

224

with the highest potency for effector T cell populations. To investigate which CD8+ T cell

225

subpopulation dominates the cytotoxic profile of CD8+ T cells in mild COVID-19 patients, we

226

analyzed the expression of Gzms and perforin in all five T cell subpopulations.

227

The representative histogram shows that GzmA was produced by transitional memory,

228

effector memory, and effector cells, whereas GzmB and perforin were only found in the latter

229

two populations in our ex vivo analysis (Fig. 5A). Next, we assessed whether the production

230

of cytotoxic molecules by effector CD8+ T cell subpopulations is influenced by the age of

231

COVID-19 patients. For a precise analysis of age effects on the expression of cytotoxic

232

molecules we stratified the COVID-19 patients into 3 age groups (29-66 (median 56); 70-76

233

(median 73); 80-96 years (median 86)). Interestingly, for effector and effector memory cells,

234

the percentages of GzmA- as well as perforin-positive cells were significantly reduced in the

235

80-96 age group compared to the 29-69 age group (Fig. 5E, G, H, G). For transitional

236

memory cells, this was only the case for GzmA (Fig. 5B). This suggests a functional

237

impairment of the cytotoxic program in the CD8+ T cells of elderly COVID-19 patients.

238

The simultaneous expression of different cytotoxic molecules is a feature of effector cells

239

with a strong cytolytic potential. Therefore, we also performed single-cell analysis of CD8+ T

240

cells from COVID-19 patients to determine the expression profiles of cytotoxic molecules for

241

the different subpopulations of CD8+ T cells. For transitional memory cells, most cells with a

242

cytotoxic profile produced only GzmA and there was no obvious difference between the age

243

groups (Fig. 6A-C). Surprisingly, the vast majority of effector and effector memory cells

244

produced all three cytotoxic molecules simultaneously (Fig. 6D-I). While all patients from the

245

youngest age group had multifunctional effector cells, some individual patients from the older

246

age groups showed reduced multifunctional responses (Fig. 6E, F, H, I). Interestingly, a

247

comparison of effector CD8+ T cells from age-matched healthy controls and COVID-19

248

patients revealed that uninfected individuals had two dominating effector cell populations:

249

GzmA and GzmB double-positive as well as GzmA, GzmB and perforin triple-positive cells,

250

whereas in COVID-19 patients, the triple-positive cells unanimously dominated the response

251

(Fig. S3). It remains to be elucidated whether CD8+ T cells that produce multiple cytotoxic

252

molecules are critical for SARS-CoV2 control or the virus-induced immunopathology, or both.

253

However, since our analysis was focused on COVID-19 patients who had a mild disease

254

course without signs of immunopathology, a protective role appears more likely.

255
256

Discussion

257

Cytotoxicity of T cells is the decisive factor for the elimination of virus-infected cells during

258

different acute infections. The CTL-mediated elimination of the virus can also lead to damage

259

of infected organs and to the progression of virus-mediated diseases. A viral infection usually

260

induces a polyclonal activation and expansion of T cells which leads to lymphocytosis in the

261

peripheral blood and a local or systemic lymphadenopathy. Some expanded T cells later

262

differentiate into effector CTLs. In the case of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, the frequency of all

263

lymphocytes in the blood and especially the frequencies of CD8+T cells are strongly reduced

264

in COVID-19 patients (3, 31). In the case of a mild disease course, this reduction was not as

265

pronounced as in the case of severe diseases (31). Interestingly, the recovery during

266

COVID-19 is associated with the reappearance of circulating effector T cells in the blood

267

(32). We analyzed only mild COVID-19 cases here and also found that the frequencies of T

268

cells in the blood were not greatly reduced, except in the older patient group. Our ex vivo

269

study indicates that COVID-19 patients show a cytotoxic response dominated by CD8+ T cell

270

in contrast to CD4+ T cells during the early period of infection. It is very likely that this CD8+

271

T cell response contributes to virus control and its subsequent elimination as it has been

272

shown in other viral infections affecting the respiratory tract (33-35). However, no cytotoxic

273

CD4+ T cell response could be demonstrated during SARS-CoV-2 infection, which may not

274

be too surprising since these cells were mainly found in chronic and not in acute self-limiting

275

viral infections (36). Interestingly, PD-1-positive CD8+ T cells show a clear profile of

276

cytotoxicity, indicating that they are most likely not functionally exhausted during acute

277

SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is in clear contrast to suggestions by other groups (26) but in

278

line with previous findings made by us and others indicating that PD-1 is a marker for

279

activation rather than for exhaustion during early phases of infections (30) and is especially

280

up-regulated on T cell subsets that produce cytotoxic molecules such as Gzms and perforin.

281

PD-1 expression is induced upon T cell activation and TCR signaling and only sets the stage

282

for subsequent immune checkpoint control post-acute infection. This is then strongly

influenced by the presence of the PD-1 ligands on virus-infected target cells (21). The control

284

of cytotoxic cells is necessary during later phases of the immune response, where

285

immunopathology rather than viral replication may become the greatest danger.

286

In contrast to the younger age group, no clear cytotoxic CD8+ T cell response in the blood

287

could be demonstrated in the age group of over 80 year old patients. Two main points

288

influence this finding: the age-dependent reduction of CD8+ T cell frequencies in the blood of

289

COVID-19 patients (25) and the previously reported high baseline expression levels of Gzms

290

and perforin being a feature of senescent CD8+ T cells from elderly individuals (37).

291

For an aged immune system, the reduction of T lymphocytes and processes of immune

292

senescence are characteristic (37). However, the nature of the progressive loss of circulating

293

CD8+ T cells in elderly COVID-19 patients is not completely understood. One possible

294

explanation may be an enhanced migration of T cells from the blood into the infected tissue.

295

Usually, the accumulation of T lymphocytes leads to a progressive inflammation in the

296

infected organs. SARS-CoV-2 infects lung epithelial cells, which might recruit cytotoxic T

297

cells into the lung. In the early phase of infection, which we analyzed here, they most like

298

contribute to virus control in the lung. However, sustained T cell cytotoxicity might also

299

contribute to organ damage. Thus, the precise recognition and elimination of infected cells

300

without the induction of too much inflammation and tissue destruction is necessary for the

301

survival of infected patients. This delicate balance of two opposing processes is very

302

important for survival. Here, multifunctional T cells, producing both perforin and Gzms at the

303

same time may be very important, as it has been shown that perforin is a critical enabler of

304

the apoptotic effects mediated by Gzms. Cells producing perforin and Gzms are necessary

305

for the efficient control of virus infections (20). We found many T cells producing Gzms and

306

perforin in our COVID-19 patient cohort, although their frequencies were reduced in elderly

307

patients. They might have contributed to efficient virus control, since all our patients showed

308

only mild symptoms and fully recovered from COVID-19. Multifunctional cytotoxic T cells

309

often express PD-1 (38), not because they are functionally impaired during acute infection,

310

but as an important negative switch to shut them down when responses are either too strong

311

or maintained for too long.

312

The cytotoxic molecules analyzed here share some overlapping functions but also elicit non-

313

redundant features. The critical effector molecule for target cell killing is perforin, as it

314

promotes the entry of Gzms into target cells and in this way enables the cytotoxic

315

functionality of Gzms (20). Thus, CTLs producing Gzms without perforin can induce severe

316

inflammation triggered by the aimless release of Gzms and inflammatory cytokines. Once

317

Gzms enter infected target cells in the presence of perforin, they mediate apoptosis of these

318

cells. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the herein identified age-associated reduction of

319

CTLs expressing perforin may be an additional factor in COVID-19 progression, as it might

320

support lung inflammation.

321

Our current data support the concept that cytotoxic CD8+ T cells play an important role in the

322

control of early SARS-CoV-2 infections, but may also be a factor of immune pathogenesis

323

and COVID-19 progression during later periods of infection. Thus, it will be important to

324

carefully balance therapeutic measures either supporting or suppressing T cell responses in

325

future COVID-19 therapy. Recent suggestions to therapeutically administer checkpoint

326

inhibitors, which are efficiently used for tumor immune therapy, for the treatment of COVID-

327

19 patients (39) should be reevaluated, since we did not find functionally exhausted CD8+ T

328

cells in our patients. In agreement with our previous findings based on acute virus infection

329

models in mice (30, 38), our clinical study suggests that a checkpoint therapy might enhance

330

the functionality of the PD-1-expressing cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients and

331

improve virus control, but with a potential to exaggerate the immunopathology in the lung and

332

other organs, which might actually accelerate decompensation.

333

Material and Methods

334
335

Study population and design. For this study, 30 patients with mild COVID-19 cases were

336

recruited directly after hospitalization, which occurred approximately one week after symptom

337

onset and at least one positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR result was available (SARS-CoV-2 test,

338

Altona Diagnostics, Hamburg). Written consent was obtained from each of the study

339

participants. The study was approved by the University Hospital Essen’s ethical committee

340

(ethics vote 20-9216-BO). Clinical characteristics of all patients are shown in Table 1.Two

341

groups of age-matched healthy individuals were used as controls: 10 individuals (6F/4M),

342

median age 50.3 years, median BMI 24.3, no diabetes and 8 individuals (3F/5M), median

343

age 85.2 years, median BMI 25.0, including 3 with diabetes. Otherwise no medical conditions

344

were reported for the control group.

Preparation of PBMCs. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from

347

peripheral blood by gradient centrifugation. Blood was collected in EDTA S-monovettes

348

(Sarstedt). Collected blood was pre-diluted with RPMI-1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and

349

overlaid onto 15 mL Pancoll separating solution (PAN-Biotech). The tubes were centrifuged

350

at 1600 rcf for 15 min at room temperature with deceleration of the centrifuge set to low.

351

Isolated PBMCs were washed twice with RPMI-1640.

352
353

Cell surface and intracellular staining by flow cytometry. Surface and intracellular

354

staining were performed as described previously (40). For the surface staining of human

355

cells, specific antibodies against human CD3 (OKT3, BioLegend), CD4 (OKT4, BioLegend),

356

CD8 (BW135/80, Miltenyi Biotec), CD45RO (UCHL1, BioLegend), CCR7 (G043H7,

357

BioLegend), CD28 (CD28.2, BioLegend), and PD-1 (EH12.2 H7, BioLegend) were used. For

358

intracellular staining antibodies against human GzmA (CB9, BioLegend), GzmB (QA16A02,

359

BioLegend) and perforin (B-D48, BioLegend) were used. Dead cells were determined by

360

Fixable Viability Dye (Thermo Fisher) staining and excluded from analysis. The numbers of

361

CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ T cells in the blood were calculated from lymphocytes counts

362

measured in a certified clinical laboratory for every patient.

363

Data were acquired on a LSR II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) from 250,000-300,000

364

lymphocyte-gated events per sample. Analyses were done using FACSDiva software

365

(Becton Dickinson) and FlowJo software (Becton Dickinson).

366
367

Statistical Analysis. Statistics comparing two groups were done using the unpaired non-

368

parametric t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. A Pearson correlation coefficient was used for the

369

definition of correlation. (GraphPad Prism software; GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego,

370

USA). When more than two groups were compared, a Dunn test with the Benjamini–

371

Hochberg correction for multiple testing was performed (R-package dunn.test, version 1.3.4).
