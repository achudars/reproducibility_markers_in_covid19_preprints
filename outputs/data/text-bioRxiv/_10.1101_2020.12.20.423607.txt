Abstract

16

Engineered red blood cells (RBCs) expressing viral receptors could be used therapeutically as

17

viral traps as RBCs lack nuclei and other organelles required for viral replication. Here we

18

show that the combination of a powerful erythroid-specific expression system and transgene

19

codon optimization yields high expression levels of the HIV-1 receptors CD4 and CCR5, as

20

well as a CD4-glycophorin A (CD4-GpA) fusion protein on enucleated RBCs. Engineered

21

RBCs expressing CD4 and CCR5 were efficiently infected by HIV-1, but CD4 or CD4-GpA

22

expression in the absence of CCR5 was sufficient to potently neutralize HIV-1 in vitro. To

23

facilitate continuous large-scale production of engineered RBCs, we generated erythroblast

24

cell lines stably expressing CD4-GpA or ACE2-GpA fusion proteins, which produced potent

25

RBC viral traps against HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Our results suggest that this approach

26

warrants further investigation as a potential treatment against viral infections.

Introduction

30

Red blood cells (RBCs) exhibit unique properties that can be exploited for therapeutic

31

applications: they are the most abundant cell type, permeate all tissues, and have a lifespan of

32

120 days, making them attractive carriers for the delivery of therapeutic cargoes1,2. Moreover,

33

RBCs do not express class I major histocompatibility complex molecules3, thus therapeutic

34

RBCs from type O-negative blood could be universally administered to patients.

35

Engineered RBCs have been proposed as ideal candidates for the design of viral traps, as

36

they lack nuclei and other organelles required for viral replication4-7. Viruses could be lured

37

into attaching to and infecting RBCs that present viral receptors, thereby leading the virus to

38

a dead end and protecting viral target cells from infection. This approach has the potential to

39

prevent viral escape, as viruses must retain the ability to bind their receptors. However,

40

expression of viral receptors on RBCs is difficult to achieve since mature erythrocytes lack

41

the cellular machinery to synthesize proteins. Hence erythroid progenitor cells need to be

42

genetically-engineered to express the viral receptors and then be differentiated into

43

enucleated RBCs. During the erythroid differentiation process, transgene expression is

44

restricted through transcriptional silencing8, translational control mechanisms9 and

45

degradation of proteins that are not normally present in RBCs10.

46

Here we show that the combination of a powerful erythroid-specific expression system and

47

transgene codon optimization yields high expression levels of the HIV-1 receptors CD4 and

48

CCR5 on enucleated RBCs to generate viral traps that potently inhibit HIV-1 infection in

49

vitro. We then applied these engineering strategies to generate erythroblast cell lines that can

50

continuously produce potent RBC viral traps against HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.

Results

52

Enucleated RBCs express HIV-1 receptors

53

We used an in vitro differentiation protocol11 to differentiate human CD34+ hematopoietic

54

stem cells (HSCs) into reticulocytes, an immature form of enucleated RBC that still contains

55

ribosomal RNA (Fig. 1a). At the end of the proliferation phase, erythroid progenitor cells

56

were transduced using lentiviral vectors carrying CD4 or CCR5 transgenes by spinoculation

57

(Fig. 1a; Supplementary Fig. 1a). We also evaluated expression of a CD4-glycophorin A

58

(CD4-GpA) fusion protein that contained the extracellular CD4 D1D2 domains fused to the

59

N-terminus of GpA, an abundantly-expressed RBC protein. This strategy enabled expression

60

of single-domain antibodies in RBCs11, but is applicable only to CD4, a single-pass

61

transmembrane protein, but not to CCR5, a multi-pass transmembrane protein. Three days

62

post-transduction, transgene expression was evaluated by flow cytometry. Expression was

63

low for transgenes when the CMV promoter or alternative ubiquitous promoters were used

64

(Fig. 1b; Supplementary Fig. 1b). CD4-GpA expressed only marginally better than CD4,

65

suggesting that additional strategies are required to achieve robust expression of viral

66

receptors.

67

To evaluate whether transcriptional silencing can be prevented by using an erythroid-specific

68

promoter, transgenes were subcloned into the CCL-βAS3-FB lentiviral vector12, which

69

contains regulatory elements that support the high expression levels of β-globin during

70

erythroid development (vectors β-CD4, β-CD4-GpA, and β-CCR5) (Supplementary Fig. 1a).

71

CD4 expression was greatly enhanced by this expression system, CCR5 expression increased

72

to a lesser extent, but CD4-GPA expression was not improved (Fig. 1b). We hypothesized

73

that the limited availability of ribosomes and transfer RNAs restricted transgene expression

74

in differentiating erythroid cells and therefore codon-optimized transgene cDNA sequences

75

(β-CD4opt, β-CD4-GpAopt, and β-CCR5opt), resulting in greatly enhanced expression for all

76

transgenes (Fig. 1b).

77

Genetically-engineered CD4+/CCR5+ erythroid progenitor cells differentiated efficiently

78

into enucleated RBCs (Fig. 1c). After differentiation, almost all cells expressed GpA, of

79

which >80% did not stain for Hoechst nuclear dye, and May-Grunwald-Giemsa staining

80

confirmed that the majority of cells were enucleated RBCs (Fig. 1c,d). Approximately 1/3 of

81

enucleated RBCs expressed CD4 and CCR5 (Fig. 1e) at levels comparable to a CD4+ T-cell

82

line (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Engineered RBCs efficiently entrap and neutralize HIV-1

95

To evaluate the efficacy of RBC viral traps against HIV-1, we generated RBCs that expressed

96

CD4+/-CCR5 or CD4-GpA+/-CCR5 (Fig. 2a) and used the β-lactamase (BlaM) fusion

97

assay13 to evaluate if HIV-1 can infect RBC viral traps. RBCs were incubated with a CCR5-

98

tropic HIV-1YU2 pseudovirus carrying a BlaM-Vpr fusion protein that enters cells upon

99

infection. When infected cells are exposed to the fluorescence resonance energy transfer

100

(FRET) substrate CCF2-AM, BlaM cleaves the β-lactam ring in CCF2-AM resulting in a

101

shift of its emission spectrum from green (520 nm) to blue (447 nm) 13. Whereas infectious

102

events were ≤0.3% in control RBCs and CD4-RBCs, 6.1% of CD4-CCR5-RBCs were

103

infected (Fig. 2b). Since only 1/3 of these RBCs expressed both receptors (Fig. 1e), this

104

corresponds to infection of almost 20% of CD4-CCR5-RBCs. Higher infection rates were

105

observed for RBCs that co-expressed CD4 and CXCR4 after incubation with a CXCR4-

106

tropic HIV-1 HxBc2 pseudovirus (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). However, RBCs that co-

107

expressed the CD4-GpA fusion protein and CCR5 or CXCR4 were infected at lower

108

frequencies (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Fig. 3b). Addition of the CD4 D3D4 domains to CD4-

109

GpA did not improve infection rates (Supplementary Fig. 3c). Unlike CD4, GpA does not

110

localize to lipid raft subdomains14, thus we speculate that low infection resulted from a lack

111

of co-localization between CD4-GpA and the CCR5 and CXCR4 co-receptors.

112
113

We assessed the therapeutic potential of RBC viral traps using a modified version of the

114

HIV-1 TZM-bl neutralization assay15 (Fig. 2c). After incubating RBCs with HIV-1YU2

115

pseudovirus, samples were centrifuged to remove RBCs and virions that attached to or

116

infected RBCs. Supernatants containing free virions that had not been captured by RBCs

117

were transferred to 96-well plates and TZM-bl cells were added to measure infectivity. CD4-

118

GpA-RBCs neutralized HIV-1YU2 most potently at a half-maximal inhibitory concentration

119

(IC50) of 1.7x106 RBCs/mL (Fig. 2d). This concentration is equivalent to 0.03% of the RBC

120

concentration of human blood (~5x109 RBCs/mL), suggesting that it is feasible to achieve

121

therapeutic concentrations in vivo. CD4-GpA-RBCs were ~4-fold more potent than CD4-

122

RBCs, likely due to higher expression levels (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. 4). Surprisingly,

123

co-expression of CCR5 lowered the neutralization activity of CD4-GpA-CCR5-RBCs and

124

CD4-CCR5-RBCs by ~2-3-fold, respectively (Fig. 2d), implying that HIV-1 infection of

125

RBC viral traps is not required for potent neutralization. CCR5 co-expression slightly

126

lowered CD4-GpA and CD4 expression levels (Fig. 2a), potentially explaining the observed

127

drop in potency. However, these results do not exclude the possibility that CCR5 expression

128

on RBC viral traps has beneficial effects in vivo.

129

We previously showed that virus-like nanoparticles presenting clusters of CD4 (CD4-VLPs)

130

that formed high-avidity interactions with trimeric HIV-1 Env spikes on virions potently

131

neutralized a diverse panel of HIV-1 strains and prevented viral escape in vitro16. To confirm

132

that RBC viral traps can also form high-avidity interactions with Env, we evaluated

133

neutralization against a mutant HIV-1YU2 Env G471R pseudovirus that was resistant to

134

monomeric soluble CD4, but was sensitive to CD4-VLPs16. CD4-GpA-RBCs potently

135

neutralized the HIV-1YU2 G471R pseudovirus (IC50=1.0x107 RBCs/mL) (Fig. 2e), suggesting

136

that RBC viral traps and CD4-VLPs would be similarly effective in preventing viral escape

137

through formation of high-avidity interactions with HIV-1 Env spikes.

156

Erythroblast cell lines stably express viral receptors and continuously produce RBC

157

viral traps against HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2

158

To generate a renewable source of RBC viral traps, we engineered the immortalized BEL-A

159

erythroblast cell line17 to stably express high levels of CD4-GpA (Fig. 3a). The CD4-GpA–

160

BEL-A cells efficiently differentiated into enucleated RBCs, as >50% of CD71-expressing

161

cells did not stain for the nuclear marker DRAQ5 (Fig. 3b). After differentiation,

162

CD71+/DRAQ5- RBCs were purified using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The

163

majority of RBCs still expressed CD4-GpA (Fig. 3c) and potently neutralized HIV-1YU2

164

(IC50=2.1x107 RBCs/mL) (Fig. 3d).

165

To evaluate if RBC viral traps could be effective against other viruses, we generated a BEL-

166

A cell line that continuously produces RBC viral traps against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that

167

caused the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic18. BEL-A cells were transduced to stably express a

168

chimeric ACE2-GpA protein containing the extracellular domain of the SARS-CoV-2

169

receptor ACE218 fused to GpA (Fig. 3e). Differentiation efficiency and transgene expression

170

on sorted CD71+/DRAQ5- RBCs was comparable to the CD4-GpA cell line (Fig. 3f,g).

171

Importantly, lentivirus-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus19 was highly susceptible to ACE2-

172

GpA-RBC neutralization (IC50=7x105 RBCs/mL) (Fig. 3h) suggesting that RBC viral traps

173

have the potential to become powerful anti-viral agents against a range of viruses.

Discussion

194

In summary, we described engineering strategies that facilitate efficient and continuous

195

production of potent RBC viral traps against HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Engineered RBCs

196

expressing HIV-1 receptors were efficiently infected by HIV-1 and potently neutralized the

197

virus in vitro, thus demonstrating the desired properties of a viral trap. Expression of CD4 or

198

the CD4-GpA fusion protein in the absence of CCR5 was sufficient to potently neutralize

199

HIV-1 due to the formation of high-avidity interactions between clusters of CD4 or CD4-

200

GpA on the RBC surface and trimeric HIV-1 Env spikes on virions. We have previously

201

shown that such high-avidity interactions enhanced the potency of CD4-VLPs by >10,000-

202

fold in comparison to conventional CD4-based inhibitors such as soluble CD4 and CD4-Ig,

203

and HIV-1 was unable to escape against CD4-VLPs in vitro16. In contrast to CD4-VLPs,

204

RBC viral traps would persist in vivo for months, implying the RBC approach has the

205

potential to provide sustained control of HIV-1 infection.

206

Engineered RBCs expressing the ACE2-GpA fusion protein potently neutralized SARS-CoV-

207

2 suggesting that RBC viral traps could be an effective treatment against a diverse range of

208

viruses. Since cell lines that generate RBC viral traps could be rapidly developed once a host

209

receptor has been identified, RBC viral traps could also become a rapid-response treatment

210

strategy for future viral outbreaks. Our results suggest that this approach warrants further

211

investigation as a potential treatment against viral infections.

Methods

214

In vitro CD34+ HSC differentiation

215

Human cord blood or mobilized peripheral blood CD34+ HSCs (StemCell Technologies)

216

were differentiated into enucleated RBCs using a modified version of a previously-described

217

protocol11. Briefly, CD34+ HSCs were cultured in expansion medium (100 ng/mL rhFlt3,

218

100 ng/mL rhSCF, 20 ng/mL rhIL-6, 20 ng/mL rhIL-3, and 100 nM dexamethasone in

219

StemSpan II medium) at a density of 105 cells/mL for 4 days. Cells were then placed in

220

differentiation 1-2 medium (2% human AB plasma, 3% human AB serum, 3 U/mL heparin,

221

10 ng/mL rhSCF, 1 ng/mL rhIL-3, and 3 U/mL erythropoietin in StemSpan II medium) at a

222

density of 105 cells/mL for 3 days and at 2 x 105 cells/mL for an additional 3 days. The cells

223

were then passaged into differentiation 3 medium (2% human AB plasma, 3% human AB

224

serum, 3 U/mL heparin, 10 ng/mL rhSCF, and 1 U/mL erythropoietin in StemSpan II

225

medium) at a density of 2 x 105 cells/mL for 4 days. To induce RBC maturation, cells were

226

cultured in differentiation 4 medium (2% human AB plasma, 3% human AB serum, 3 U/mL

227

heparin, 0.1 U/mL erythropoietin, and 200 μg/mL holo-transferrin in StemSpan II medium) at

228

a density of 106 cells/mL for 4 days, and in differentiation 5 medium (2% human AB plasma,

229

3% human AB serum, 3 U/mL heparin, and 200 μg/mL holo-transferrin in StemSpan II

230

medium) at a density of 5 x 106 cells/mL for an additional 3 days. For morphological

231

analysis, cells were spun onto glass slides by cytocentrifugation, stained with May-

232

Grünwald-Giemsa reagents (Sigma-Aldrich), and examined under an LSM800 laser scanning

233

confocal microscope (Zeiss).

Transgenes and codon optimization

238

Human CD4, CCR5, CXCR4, ACE2 and glycophorin A (GpA) cDNA sequences were

239

obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The CD4-GpA fusion

240

construct encoded the CD4 signal peptide and D1D2 domains fused to the N-terminus of

241

GpA with a 9-residue linker (Glu-Pro-Lys-Thr-Pro-Lys-Pro-Gln-Pro). The ACE2-GpA

242

fusion protein construct encoded the extracellular domain of human ACE2 (residues 1-614)

243

fused to the N-terminus of GpA with the 9-residue linker. Transgenes were cloned into the

244

lentiviral backbone plasmids pHAGE-IRES-ZsGreen (PlasmID Repository, Harvard Medical

245

School) for expression under ubiquitous promoters (CMV, EF1α, UBC, and CASI promoters)

246

and pCCL-FB12 (provided by Dr. Donald Kohn, UCLA) for erythroid-specific expression.

247

Codon optimization of transgene cDNA sequences was performed using the GeneArt

248

GeneOptimizer software (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

249
250

Lentiviral transduction

251

VSV-G-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors were produced by co-transfecting HEK293T cells

252

with lentiviral backbone plasmids and packaging plasmids (pHDM-Hgpm2, pHDM-tat1b,

253

pRC/CMV-rev1b, pHDM-G) using Fugene HD (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s

254

protocol. Supernatants were collected after 48 and 72 hours, and lentiviral vectors were

255

concentrated 50-fold using Lenti-X concentrator solution (Takara) according to the

256

manufacturer’s protocol. On day 10 of the differentiation protocol, erythroid progenitor cells

257

were seeded at a density of 106 cells/mL in 12-well plates in the presence of 10 μg/mL

258

polybrene. 20 μL of concentrated lentiviral vector was added per well and plates were spun

259

for 1.5 hours at 850 x g at 30°C. Plates were then incubated for 3 hours at 37°C before

260

passaging the transduced cells into differentiation 3 medium. For cells that were co-

261

transduced to express two transgenes, 20 μL of each lentiviral vector was added per well. To

generate large numbers of engineered RBCs for neutralization assays, two transductions steps

Transgene expression and RBC maturation efficiency were analyzed by flow cytometry

267

(MACSQuant, Miltenyi Biotec). 2-3 x 105 cells were collected for each condition and

268

samples were stained with the following antibodies: APC-conjugated anti-human CD4

269

(Invitrogen), FITC-conjugated anti-human CD4 (BD Bioscience), FITC-conjugated anti-

270

human CCR5 (BioLegend), PE-conjugated anti-human CXCR4 (Invitrogen), FITC-

271

conjugated anti-human ACE2 (R&D Systems), APC-conjugated anti-CD235ab (BioLegend),

272

and Brilliant Violet 421-conjugated anti-human CD71 (BioLegend). The percentage of

273

enucleated RBCs was measured by double staining cells with APC-conjugated anti-CD235ab

274

and the nuclear stain Hoechst (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Enucleated RBCs were defined as

275

CD235ab+/Hoechst- cells. The percentage of enucleated RBCs that expressed transgenes was

276

measured by triple-staining cells with APC-conjugated anti-human CD4, FITC-conjugated

277

anti-human CCR5, and Hoechst nuclear stain.

279

β-lactamase fusion assay

280

The ability of engineered RBCs to be infected by HIV-1 was evaluated using a modified

281

version of the β-lactamase (BlaM) assay13. R5-tropic HIV-1YU2 and X4-tropic HIV-1HxBc2

282

pseudovirus were produced by co-transfecting a confluent T75 flask of HEK293T cells with

283

the PSG3∆Env backbone plasmid (8 μg), the YU2 or HxBc2 Env expression plasmid (4 μg),

284

and a plasmid expressing a BlaM-Vpr fusion protein20 (4 μg; provided by Dr. Wesley

Sundquist, University of Utah). The supernatant was collected after 72 hours and

286

concentrated by centrifugal filtration. 5 x 104 RBCs were seeded in 100 μL differentiation 5

287

medium in 96-well plates in the presence of 10 μg/mL polybrene. 20 μL of concentrated

288

YU2-BlaM-Vpr or HxBc2-BlaM-Vpr pseudovirus were added and plates were spun at 1,000

289

x g for 1 hour at 30°C. Plates were then incubated at 37°C overnight. On the next day, freshly

290

prepared 6X CCF2-AM labeling solution was added, and cells were stained for 2 hours at

291

room temperature in the dark. After two washes with PBS, the cells were analyzed by flow

292

cytometry (MACSQuant, Miltenyi Biotec).

293
294

HIV-1 neutralization assays

295

The ability of engineered RBCs to inhibit HIV-1 infection of target cells was tested by using

296

a modified version of the HIV-1 pseudovirus-based TZM-bl assay15. Briefly, serial dilutions

297

of control and engineered RBCs were seeded in 400 μL TZM-bl media in 48-well plates and

298

incubated with 0.4 μL HIV-1YU2 pseudovirus (TCID50 = 3.2 x 105 IU/mL) for 4 hours on an

299

orbital shaker (400 rpm) at 37°C in the presence of 10 μg/mL of polybrene. Cells were then

300

spun down at 500 x g for 10 min and 155 μL of the supernatants were transferred to 96-well

301

plates. TZM-bl reporter cells (NIH AIDS Reagents Program) were added, and luminescence

302

was measured after 48 hours.

303
304

SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays

305

Lentivirus-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was generated by transfecting HEK293T cells

306

with a luciferase-expressing lentiviral backbone plasmid, accessory plasmids (pHDM-

307

Hgpm2, pHDM-tat1b, pRC/CMV-rev1b), and a plasmid encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike

308

protein with a 21-residue cytoplasmic tail deletion (Wuhan Hu-1 strain; GenBank

309

NC_045512). The neutralization activity of ACE2-GpA RBCs was measured using a

310

modified version of a recently-reported protocol19. 1.25 x 104 293T-ACE2 cells (provided by

311

Dr. Jesse Bloom, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center) were seeded per well on poly-L-

312

Lysine-coated 96-well plates (Corning) 18 hours before infection. Serial dilutions of control

313

and ACE2-GpA-RBCs were seeded in 400 μL media (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS

314

and Pen-Strep) and incubated with 3 μL of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the SARS-

315

CoV-2 Spike protein (5.5x107 RLU/mL) for 4 hours on an orbital shaker (400 rpm) at 37°C

316

in the presence of 10 μg/mL of polybrene. The lentiviral backbone of this SARS-CoV-2

317

pseudovirus system expresses luciferase to enable detection of infected cells. RBCs were

318

spun down at 500 x g for 10 min and 100 μL supernatant was transferred to the 96-well plate

319

with the seeded 293T-ACE2 cells. Luminescence was measured after 48 hours using a plate

320

reader (Tecan).

322

Generation of stable erythroblast cell lines

323

Immortalized BEL-A erythroblast cells17 (provided by Dr. Jan Frayne, University of Bristol)

324

were transduced with VSV-G–pseudotyped lentiviral vectors carrying the CD4-GpA or

325

ACE2-GpA transgenes in the erythroid-specific pCCL-FB expression cassette. To allow

326

positive selection of cells that stably expressed the transgenes, the puromycin-N-

327

acetyltransferase gene was added downstream of the transgene and a P2A cleavage peptide 21.

328

Stable BEL-A / CD4-GpA and BEL-A / ACE2-GpA cell lines were generated by growing the

329

transduced cells in expansion media (50 ng/mL rhSCF, 3 U/mL erythropoietin, 1 µM

330

dexamethasone, and 1 µg/mL doxycycline in StemSpan II medium) in the presence of 0.25

331

µg/mL puromycin for 3-4 weeks. Differentiation of BEL-A cells was initiated as described17

332

by transferring the cells into primary media (3% human AB serum, 2% FBS, 3 U/mL

333

heparin, 10 ng/mL rhSCF, 1 ng/mL rhIL-3, 3 U/mL erythropoietin, 200 µg/mL holo16

334

transferrin, and 1 µg/mL doxycycline in StemSpan II medium) for 3-4 days at a density of 2 x

335

105 cells/mL. To induce RBC maturation, cells were moved into tertiary media (3% human

336

AB serum, 2% FBS, 3 U/mL heparin, 3 U/mL erythropoietin, 500 µg/mL holo-transferrin,

337

and 1 U/mL Pen-Strep in StemSpan II medium) for 4 days at a density of 1 x 106 cells/mL.

338
339

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)

340

Enucleated RBCs were purified by FACS on day 7 of the BEL-A differentiation protocol.

341

Brilliant Violet 421-conjugated anti-human CD71 antibody (BioLegend) and the nuclear

342

stain DRAQ5 (Abcam) were diluted 1:100 and 1:1,000 in PBS+ (PBS supplemented with 2%

343

FBS). Cells were stained at a concentration of 2.5 x 107 cells/mL for 30 min at room

344

temperature in the dark. After two washes in PBS+, cells were resuspended in PBS+ at a

345

concentration of 1 x 107 cells/mL. Enucleated RBCs were defined as CD71+/DRAQ5- cells

346

and this cell population was purified using a SONY SH800 cell sorter (Sony Biotechnology).
