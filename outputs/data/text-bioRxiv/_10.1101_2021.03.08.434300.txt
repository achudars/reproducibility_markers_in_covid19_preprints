At a Glance Commentary
Scientific Knowledge on the Subject
There is now a growing body of evidence that children are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2
infection compared to adults and if infected, children are more likely to develop an
asymptomatic infection. The reasons for this remain unclear. In particular, the role of the
pediatric nasal epithelium, the primary point of viral entry into the human host, in this
differential susceptibility has yet to be investigated.
What This Study Adds to the Field
Our study indicates that pediatric nasal epithelial cells produce a more vigorous anti-viral and
pro-inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 compared to adult cells. This is associated with
reduced SARS-CoV-2, but not influenza virus, replication in pediatric epithelial cells. We
also show that on a protein level SARS-CoV-2 receptor expression on nasal epithelial cells is
not significantly different between children and adults. These data provide an important
insight into pediatric infections with SARS-CoV-2.

Abstract:
Rationale: Young children (typically those <10 years old) are less susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection and symptoms compared to adults. However, the mechanisms that underlie these
age-dependent differences remain to be determined and could inform future therapeutics for
adults.
Objective: To contrast the infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in primary nasal epithelial
cells from adults and children.
Methods: Viral replication was quantified by plaque assay. The cellular transcriptome of
infected and uninfected cells was assessed by RNA-seq. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein
expression were quantified by Western Blot.
Measurements and Main Results: We report significantly higher SARS-CoV-2
replication in adult compared to pediatric nasal epithelial cells. This was restricted to SARSCoV-2 infection, as the same phenomenon was not observed with influenza virus infection. The
differentiational SARS-CoV-2 replication dynamics were associated with an elevated type I
and III interferon response, and a more pronounced inflammatory response in pediatric cells.
No significant difference between the two age groups was observed in the protein levels of
ACE2 and TMPRSS2.
Conclusions: Our data suggest that the innate immune response of pediatric nasal epithelial
cells, and not differential receptor expression, may contribute to the reported reduced SARSCOV-2 infection and symptoms reported amongst children.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of COVID-19) causes a broad range of clinical symptoms,
ranging from asymptomatic infection to potentially fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS). Children typically experience mild symptoms of COVID-19 when compared to adults
(1). However, there is now a growing body of evidence that children may also be less
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specifically, a low rate of pediatric SARS-CoV-2
infections has been observed in multiple countries including China (2), Italy (3), the U.S.A (4),
Spain (5, 6) and Poland (6, 7). However, this may be underrepresented since SARS-CoV-2
infections in children are frequently asymptomatic and may therefore go undetected in
screening studies of symptomatic individuals (8). To overcome this potential confounder, an
Icelandic study tested 5069 healthy adults and 433 healthy children (or those with only a mild
cold) for SARS-CoV-2 (9). Whilst more adults were tested than children, positive infection in
children was lower compared to adults (9). These data are in line with those from Vo’, Italy
(10). Here, all age groups were homogenously sampled, yet no children tested positive for
SARS-CoV-2 infection, despite the fact that at least 13 of these children lived together with
infected family members (10). Similarly, in a meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 household
transmission clusters, children were significantly less likely to contract SARS-CoV-2 from
infected family members compared to adult members of the household (11). These findings
have been echoed in multiple single site studies where, both within and outside of households,
the infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 amongst children <10 years old is significantly lower than
that of adults (12). Reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission is also observed in
juvenile ferrets compared to their older counterparts (13).
The reasons for less frequent SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptoms in children remain
unclear and may be influenced by a multitude of factors. Pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV2 (likely derived from seasonal coronaviruses) may offer some form of cross-protection from

infection in children (14). SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein reactive antibodies in SARS-CoV2 uninfected individuals are more prevalent amongst children and adolescents (14). It is also
striking to note that this differential susceptibility is somewhat unique to SARS-CoV-2. For
example, children have been identified as having the highest influenza virus infection rate of
any age group and pay a major role in the spread of the virus (15).
It is possible that pediatric nasal epithelial cells (NECs) (the initial target of SARS-CoV2 infection) are fundamentally different from those of adults. Gene expression studies from the
nasal epithelium of healthy individuals suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, is
expressed at lower levels in the nasal cavity of children compared to adults (16). However, this
has yet to be validated on a protein level. Moreover, this does not appear to be the case in all
patient cohorts (17, 18). Following binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein to ACE2, the
host surface protease TMPRSS2 cleaves the full-length S protein at its S2' site, facilitating the
fusion of viral and cellular membranes to deliver the viral RNA into the cytosol (19). Low levels
of TMPRSS2 trigger viral entry via a less efficient pathway, that is dependent on endosomes
and cathepsin mediated spike cleavage (20). The nasal cavities of children express less
TMPRSS2 than those of adults, which may explain the less frequent pediatric infections with
SARS-CoV-2 (21). However, this has also yet to be confirmed at a protein level.
In addition to differential receptor expression, pediatric and adult NECs may also mount
fundamentally different innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2. The induction of type I and
III interferon (IFNs) in the respiratory tract is essential for protection against viral disease (22).
SARS-CoV-2 is a poor inducer of the type I and III interferon response (23), and the
significance of interferons in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection is best demonstrated by the
fact that the presence of neutralising anti-type I IFNs antibodies increases the risk of severe
COVID-19 (24). Recent RNA sequencing of the whole epithelium from pediatric and adult
proximal airways suggest that there is a higher expression of genes associated with interferon

alpha and gamma responses in children compared to adults (25). However, whether this results
in reduced replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the nasal epithelium of children remains to be
determined.
Here, we use primary NECs, differentiated at an air-liquid interface, to investigate
differential infection kinetics and antiviral responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and
adults.

Methods
Cell collection and ethics statement
Primary NECs were collected from healthy individuals by placing a sterile nasal mucosal
curette (Arlington Scientific Inc., USA) in the mid-inferior portion of the inferior turbinate.

described (27). Fully differentiated adult and pediatric NECs were infected with mock (PBS),
SARS-CoV-2 or Auckland/09 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3 for each virus.
Additional detail is provided in the online supplement.
Quantification of infectious virus
SARS-CoV-2 titres in cell culture supernatants were determined by plaque assay on Vero cells,
as described previously (28). Influenza virus titers in cell culture supernatants were determined
by plaque assay on MDCK cells, as described previously (29).
Histology
Fixed cells on a transwell membrane were routine processed and embedded in paraffin,
sectioned at 5μm and subsequently stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Sections were
assessed for cellular morphology by a veterinary pathologist (H.B.) blinded to the experimental
design.
RNA extraction and quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR)
RNA was extracted from NECs and transcribed into cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Real time PCR was performed with SYBER Green (Invitrogen) and gene expression was
normalized relative to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression.

hallmark gene sets (version 7.2) (32). Gene Ontology enrichment analysis was performed using
the R package GOseq. Additional detail is provided in the online supplement.
Statistical analysis
Unless otherwise indicated, outliers of continual variables were removed using ROUT’s test
(Q = 1%). Data were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Where data were
normally distributed, data was analyzed using an unpaired two-tailed student’s t-test. Where
data were not normally distributed, data was analyzed using a Mann-Whitney U test.
Significance was set at p<0.05.

Results
Pediatric nasal epithelial cells are phenotypically different to adult nasal epithelial cells
To investigate the role of NECs in SARS-CoV-2 infection, adult and pediatric NECs were
differentiated at an air-liquid interface. The phenotype and transcriptome of these cells at
baseline (prior to infection) was then assessed. Adult NECs grew as a pseudostratified columnar
epithelium with scattered goblet cells and ciliated epithelial cells (Figure 1A). Pediatric NECs
also grew as a pseudostratified columnar epithelium with ciliated epithelial cells and goblet
cells. However, scattered cells with pyknotic nucleus and condensed cytoplasm were also
observed, leaving pseudocysts in the epithelium (Figure 1A). This is potentially indicative of
higher cell turn-over and metabolic rate in the pediatric epithelial cells (33, 34). To characterize
the transcriptional difference between these cells, RNASeq was performed. Principle
component analysis suggested that pediatric and adult NECs formed distinct groups based on
their transcriptome (Figure 1B). DEGs of naive pediatric NECs compared to adult cells were
identified and listed in Table E1 in the online data supplement (Fig. 1C). Numerous gene
signatures associated with metabolism (e.g., Ox Phos, MTORC1, glycolysis) and cell

replication (e.g., MYC targetsand DNA repair) were upregulated in pediatric cells, consistent
with the observed morphology. Moreover, relative to adult cells, pediatric epithelial cells
upregulated genes associated with pro-inflammatory pathways such as tumor necrosis factor
alpha (TNF-α) signaling via NFkB, Complement, IFN alpha response and IFN gamma response
(Figure 1D and Figure E1 in the online data supplement). Together, these data indicate that
even in the absence of a viral infection, pediatric NECs in vitro have a different and more proinflammatory transcriptome compared to adult NECs.

list). For pathways with a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05, normalized enrichment scores are shown.

Pediatric and adult nasal epithelial cells produce similar amounts of ACE2 and TMPRSS2
protein
Previous mRNA expression studies suggest that pediatric NECs express lower levels of ACE2
and TMPRSS2 compared to their adult counterparts (16, 21). However, these findings remains
controversial (18). Indeed, our RNASeq data showed that there was no significant difference
the expression level of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (p value > 0.05; data not shown). To investigate
the levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein between adult and pediatric NECs Western blots
were performed on uninfected cells (Figure 2). Whilst some donor-to-donor variation was
observed there was no significant difference in the protein levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2
between adult and pediatric donors (p = 0.2 and p = 0.5 respectively).

Pediatric nasal epithelial cells are less permissive to SARS-CoV-2 replication
Given the enhanced inflammatory response of nasal epithelial cells, and despite the absence of
differential ACE2 and TMPRSS2 levels, we next sought to determine if pediatric epithelial
cells were less susceptible than adult cells to SARS-COV-2 replication. Strikingly, significantly
reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication was observed in pediatric NECs at 24 and 72 h.p.i (Figure
3A). Reduced western blot signal for SARS-CoV-2 NP was also observed in pediatric NECs at
72 hours post-infection, although this did not reach significance (p = 0.07; Figure 3B and C,
Figure E2 in the online data supplement).To determine if decreased viral replication was
specific to SARS-CoV-2, these experiments were repeated using influenza A virus, which is
known to be highly transmissible amongst children (15, 35).

Strikingly, there was a trend

Pediatric nasal epithelial cells mount a strong anti-viral response to SARS-CoV-2
To gain a further insight into the anti-viral response of pediatric NECs to SARS-CoV-2, RNA
Seq was performed on adult and pediatric cells 72 hours post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. A global
analysis of the transcriptome of infected cells (independent of donors’ age) suggested that
infection was associated with the expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) (Online data
supplement Figure E3 and Table E3). However, there was no clear clustering of infected and
uninfected cells by PCA (Figure E3). In contrast, when DGEs (Table E4 in the online data
supplement.) in infected cells was analyzed by controlling for the effect of the age group, adult
and pediatric cells formed distinct clusters by PCA (Figure 4A). Relative to infected adult cells,
infected pediatric cells upregulated numerous pathways associated with the inflammatory
response, including complement and inflammatory response (Figure 4B & C). Strikingly, gene
ontology (GO) enrichment analysis (Figure 4D) demonstrated a strong interferon response in
infected pediatric cells, with GO terms such as ‘viral process’, ‘type I interferon signaling’,
‘response to virus’, ‘regulation of defense response to virus’, ‘negative regulation of viral
genome replication’, ‘defense response to virus’ and ‘cellular response to interferon alpha’
being significantly upregulated in infected pediatric epithelial cells. None of these GO terms
were identified amongst top differentially expressed GO terms in adult cells infected with
SARS-CoV-2 (Online data supplement Figure E5).
To determine if this interferon response was specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the
expression of three ISGs (IFIT1, CXCL10, ISG15; identified as DEG in RNA Seq analysis) was
assessed in pediatric and adult NECs infected with either SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus by
qPCR (Figure 4E). Globally, there was a reduced IFN response to SARS-CoV-2 compared to
influenza virus, in line with previous reports (36) (Figure 4E). Consistent with our RNA-seq
data, IFIT1 and ISG15 were significantly upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected pediatric NECs
compared to adult cells at 48 hours post-infection. Akin to the situation with SARS-CoV-2,

pediatric epithelial cells infected with influenza A virus had increased expression of CXCL10
(24- and 48-hours post-infection) and ISG15 (24 hours post-infection).

Discussion
Large clinical data sets and systematic reviews suggest that children are less often infected with
SARS-CoV-2 than adults (11, 37-39). However, the mechanisms driving these observations
have been unclear. Here, we have provided the first evidence that the innate immune response
of pediatric nasal epithelium may play an important role in reducing the susceptibility of
children to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Previous studies have suggested that the reduced susceptibility of children to SARS-CoV2 infection is due to reduced expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA. Specifically, it has
been hypothesized that the lower level of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in pediatric upper airways
epithelial cells limits viral infectivity in children (16), although this has remained somewhat
controversial (17, 18). In the present study we showed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein
expression level were not modulated with age. These data suggest that mRNA expression does
not always correlate to protein expression and it is important to quantify protein level expression
across a broader number of studies.
Despite similar expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, we observed a significant reduced
replication decrease of SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric nasal cells compared to those of adults.
Given that the nasal epithelium is the first site of SARS-CoV-2 infection these data are
consistent with the reduced number of SARS-CoV-2 infected children recorded in
epidemiological studies (40, 41). There have been previous suggestions that nasopharyngeal
SARS-CoV-2 titers in children and adolescents are equivalent to those of adults (42, 43).
However, reanalysis of the aforementioned studies have shown that young children (<10
years old) did indeed have a significantly lower viral load (44), or that the comparison was
being performed between children in the first 2 days of symptoms and hospitalized adults
with severe disease (45) or that the dataset included few children younger than 16 years (46).
Other such studies (47) have been questioned in relation to the unusually low cycle threshold

(Ct) values recorded (48, 49). Moreover, decreased viral replication in pediatric epithelial
cells is consistent with experimental studies in ferrets where aged ferrets showed higher viral
load and longer nasal virus shedding (50). Therefore, it is currently difficult to ascertain if
there is or is not an age-dependent difference in SARS-CoV-2 nasal titres in infected
individuals.
Consistent with reduced SARS-CoV-2 replication in the nasal epithelium of children,
pediatric epithelial cells had a more pronounced pro-inflammatory response (compared to adult
cells) prior to and following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, a pronounced interferon
response and the expression of ISGs was detected in infected pediatric, but not adult NECs.
Increased ISG expression, and the subsequent anti-viral response may contribute to the reduced
viral replication observed in pediatric cells. These findings are consistent with those of
Maughan et al, who analysed transcriptional profile of airway (tracheobronchial) epithelium
and observed upregulated type I and II IFNs associated genes expression levels in children (25).
Similarly, in the nasal fluid of children and adults presenting to the Emergency Department
with SARS-CoV-2 there were significantly higher levels of IFN-a2 in the fluid derived from
children. Increased interferon signaling was also recorded in the nasopharyngeal transcriptome
of children compared to that of adults (17). The question remains as to why pediatric epithelial
cells mount a stronger inflammatory and anti-viral response to SARS-CoV-2 compared to adult
cells. This may represent an adaptation to the increased antigenic challenge observed in
childhood. Alternatively, it is possible that increased antigenic exposure in childhood ‘trains’
nasal epithelia in children to mount a stronger pro-inflammatory response to any antigenic
challenge. Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that any metabolic differences between
pediatric and NECs (as potentially suggested by the different morphologies of the cells) could
alter gene expression. It is also important to recognize that these data may not be applicable to

all patient populations as previous studies of children and adults hospitalized with COVID-19
did not find an age dependent difference in the interferon response (51).
A pronounced pro-inflammatory and anti-viral response in pediatric cells was not
restricted to SARS-CoV-2 infection and a similar result was observed following influenza
virus infection. However, influenza virus replicated equally as well (if not better) in pediatric
cells compared to adults. These data are consistent with the high sensitivity of children to
influenza virus infection (35). These data are also seemingly discordant with the increased
inflammatory response of pediatric cells. However, SARS-CoV-2 is highly sensitive to
interferon treatment, more so than influenza A virus (23, 52). Therefore, we speculate that
whilst the differential interferon response between children and adults is sufficient to inhibit
SARS-CoV-2 replication, it is not sufficient to inhibit influenza virus replication.
These data potentially have important clinical implications. Specifically, the use of
recombinant IFNs as a treatment in SARS has been identified as a promising therapeutic
candidate (53). The data presented here support this notion. Further investigation as to the
clinical efficacy of interferon therapy in COVID-19 is warranted.
Finally, it is important to recognize the limitations of this study. Due to the difficulties
associated with obtaining NECs from children only a limited number of donors could be used.
However, as donors were not selected on susceptibility to respiratory viral infection their
responses should be broadly representative of other healthy children. Furthermore, our data
focused on the role of nasal epithelial cells in age-dependent differences in SARS-CoV-2
infection. However, there can be a number of other mechanisms to explain the reduced
susceptibility of children to SARS-CoV-2 infection that were not measured in the present study.
For example, children and adolescents have much higher titres of preexisting antibodies to
SARS-CoV-2 compared to adults (14, 54). This study is unable to ascertain if this plays a more
significant role than the nasal epithelium in protecting children from infection in vivo. Finally,

it is important to recognize that these in vitro studies were performed with an early SARS-CoV2 isolate and therefore did not represent the viral mutations that are currently circulating in the
community. This remains an area of ongoing research in our laboratory.
In sum, the data presented here suggest that the nasal epithelium of children is distinct and
that it may afford children some level of protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection.
