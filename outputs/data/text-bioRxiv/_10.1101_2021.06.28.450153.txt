Abstract

30

The emergence of mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains associated with an increased risk of COVID-19-

31

related death necessitates better understanding of the early viral dynamics, host responses and

32

immunopathology. While studies have reported immune profiling using single cell RNA

33

sequencing in terminal human COVID-19 patients, performing longitudinal immune cell

34

dynamics in humans is challenging. Macaques are a suitable model of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

35

We performed longitudinal single-cell RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell

36

suspensions from adult rhesus macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 (n=6) to delineate the

37

early dynamics of immune cells changes. The bronchoalveolar compartment exhibited dynamic

38

changes in transcriptional landscape 3 days post- SARS-CoV-2-infection (3dpi) (peak viremia),

39

relative to 14-17dpi (recovery phase) and pre-infection (baseline). We observed the

40

accumulation of distinct populations of both macrophages and T-lymphocytes expressing strong

41

interferon-driven inflammatory gene signature at 3dpi. Type I IFN response was highly induced

42

in the plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The presence of a distinct HLADR+CD68+CD163+SIGLEC1+

43

macrophage population exhibiting higher angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression

44

was also observed. These macrophages were significantly recruited to the lungs of macaques

45

at 3dpi and harbored SARS-CoV-2, while expressing a strong interferon-driven innate anti-viral

46

gene signature. The accumulation of these responses correlated with decline in viremia and

47

recovery. The recruitment of a myeloid cell-mediated Type I IFN response is associated with the

48

rapid clearance of SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaques.

Introduction

56

The underlying immune mechanisms that drive disease versus protection during the

57

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are not well understood.

58

transcriptomic responses can be extremely useful in identifying features of protection and

59

pinpoint the host immune processes involved in the control of infection and drivers of pathology

60

1,2

61

mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of COVID-19 patients show distinct host inflammatory cytokine

62

profiles, suggesting that excessive cytokine release is associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis

63

3

64

the excessive cytokine storm at that time is a representation of an exacerbated viral infection

65

and associated immune dysregulation. We recently developed a nonhuman primate (NHP)

66

model of SARS-CoV-2 infection4, where NHPs develop signs of COVID-19 disease including

67

characteristic ground glass opacities in lungs, coinciding with a cytokine storm and a myeloid

68

cell influx, followed by clearance of the virus and recovery4. Using RNAseq, we showed that

69

Interferon (IFN) signaling, neutrophil degranulation and innate immune pathways were

70

significantly induced in the SARS-CoV-2-infected lungs of NHPs, while pathways associated

71

with collagen formation were downregulated

72

naturally, our results point to the importance of early innate immune responses and cytokine

73

signaling, particularly Type I IFN signaling, in protecting against COVID-19. One limitation of the

74

above study was that it was conducted in terminal lung samples and thus may not represent the

75

dynamic

76

transcriptomics was studied using bulk-RNAseq, thus averaging the overall contributions of

77

various cell types and pathways at play.

78

The use of single-cell technologies such as RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) allows unbiased and

79

significantly more in-depth profiling of immune cell populations in animal models and humans in

80

both healthy and diseased states. Because scRNAseq can define the transcriptomic

81

heterogeneity of a complex community of cells and assign unbiased identity classifications to

82

cell populations, it is optimally suited for the study of complex inflammatory states such as the

83

one engendered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. ScRNAseq has recently identified initial cellular

84

targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection in model organisms

85

peripheral and local immune responses in severe COVID-19

86

associated with a cytokine storm and increased neutrophil accumulation. However, the human

87

studies have mostly been performed in peripheral blood samples14, BAL9 and tissues8,15 from a

88

limited number of moderate or severe COVID-19 patients within limited age ranges. To

89

overcome the limitations associated with longitudinal early immune profiling in human subjects

90

and to get more in-depth understanding of the early dynamics of transcriptional changes during

91

COVID-19, we characterized the transcriptional signatures at the single cell level in the broncho-

92

alveolar compartment of rhesus macaques at pre-infection collected 7 days before infection (-

93

7dpi), at early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection (3dpi) and at endpoint of the study (14-17dpi).

94

Thus, the immune landscape in the broncho-alveolar compartment of SARS-CoV-2 infected

95

adult rhesus macaques serves as a surrogate of early immune dynamics of protective immune

96

responses in lungs after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We observed the appearance of distinct

97

macrophage and T-lymphocyte populations exhibiting IFN-driven inflammatory gene signatures

98

at 3dpi. The IFN responsive macrophage populations upregulated ACE2 expression and were

99

infected by SARS-CoV-2. Further analysis of upregulated genes in the macrophages revealed

100

IFN-driven innate antiviral defense and negative regulation of viral genome replication,

101

suggesting a prominent role of macrophages driven innate immunity in resolution of SARS-CoV-

107

To understand the early immune responses generated by SARS-CoV-2 in NHP model of

COVID-19, we analyzed cryopreserved single cells isolated from BAL of young rhesus

macaques infected by SARS-CoV-2

7dpi), three days post infection (3dpi), endpoint (14-17dpi) (Fig 1a). These time points were

111

validated to represent distinct phases of viral dynamics in vivo covering baseline, the peak of

112

acute viral infection (3dpi) and at the time that infection had resolved (endpoint) (Fig 1b) 4.

at the following time points: 7 days prior to infection (-

114

We subjected single cells isolated from BAL of the SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus macaques to 3’

115

10x Genomics based scRNAseq processing and analysis pipeline with rigorous QC threshold

116

(Fig S1) at -7dpi (n = 6), 3dpi (n = 6), and 14-17dpi (n = 6). Sequencing yielded a total of

117

170078 cells ranging from 1543-16608 cells per sample. The mean number of cells per sample

118

in -7dpi was 8484, 3dpi was 9840 and 14-17dpi was 10021. Majority of the cells were

119

immunocytes (Fig 1c) distributed across all time points (Fig 1d) and animals (Fig 1c, Fig S2).

120

Consistent with the prior reports on cellular composition of BAL in rhesus macaques, myeloid

121

were abundant comprising 77% of total cell than lymphoid compartment with 22% cells across

122

all time points. The populations were homogenously distributed across all animals and across

123

timepoints (Fig S2b). We identified 19 distinct cell clusters spanning varied cell types based on

124

expression of canonical genes- T cells: Cluster of differentiation (CD) 3D+; Natural Killer (NK)

132

distinctively marked by appearance of cell population expressing distinct IFN responsive gene

137

Synthetase (OAS) 1, OAS2, OAS3 (Figure 2b). Although IFN-α and ACE2 transcripts were not

138

abundantly present in the scRNAseq dataset, confocal analysis validated strong upregulation of

139

IFN-α and ACE-2 in lungs of macaques on 3dpi compared to healthy or 14-17dpi (Fig 2c,d).

140

Confocal analyses also validated higher expression IFN responsive transcripts like MX1 (Fig2e),

141

MX2 (Fig2f) and ISG15 (Fig2g) in lung tissues isolated from rhesus macaques at 3dpi (Fig 2c)

142

when compared to 14-17dpi and healthy macaques.

143

As described previously, in BAL, SARS-CoV-2 vRNA levels were detected in of 5/6 macaques

144

at 3dpi by RT-qPCR. Virtually no BAL vRNA was detected at the endpoint suggesting that the

145

rhesus macaques cleared the virus, from the BAL compartment 4. vRNA in Nasal Swabs (NS)

146

could be detected in only 4 animals at Day 3, while all animals recorded vRNA at Day 9, and

147

only 3 at the endpoints. vRNA was detected in the lungs of 3 macaques at necropsy (14-17dpi)

148

while no SARS CoV-2 subgenomic RNA (correlate for infectious/replicating virus) was detected

149

in any rhesus macaque lungs at Endpoints 4. No vRNA was detected in any plasma samples or

150

in randomly selected urine samples. Based on vRNA persistence in the lungs of

151

immunocompetent young macaques and the absence of replicative virus, it was concluded that

152

that macaques efficiently control SARS-CoV-2 infection in a duration of two weeks 4. In lieu of

153

the absence of replicating virus in lungs at endpoint and peak viremia in 3dpi BAL, in vivo

154

pathology was also found to peak around 3dpi and subsided thereafter as shown by chest x-ray

155

scores. Furthermore, tissue pathologies were observed in lungs at endpoints suggesting viral

156

antigen triggered immune response by persisting antigen. Along with the absence of replicating

157

virus in lungs at endpoint pathological observations were found as shown by histological

158

analyses endpoint 4. Our previous immunological analyses of BAL cells by flow cytometry had

159

revealed a massive infiltration of immunocytes mainly comprising of T cells, interstitial

160

macrophages, neutrophils and plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells 4. Appearance of these populations

161

also correlated strongly with the viral loads 4. When combined with these previously reported

162

findings, our new results clearly establish influx of myeloid cells and induction of a fully

163

functional IFN driven innate immune response in macrophages against SARS-CoV-2 in the

164

lungs of rhesus macaques. Our scRNA-seq based deep cellular phenotyping analysis clearly

165

establishes the induction of a robust and targeted innate immune response mainly driven by

166

macrophages as opposed to dysregulated immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 in the early

167

phase of infection.

169

Myeloid bronchoalveolar landscape

170

A total of 129280 myeloid cells were analyzed across all timepoints which distributed into 17

171

distinct clusters across the 3 timepoints studied (Fig 3A-B, Fig S3a). The populations were

172

homogenously distributed across all animals at all timepoints (Fig S3b). We noted distinctive

173

cluster alignment of all myeloid populations based on key myeloid phenotype markers (Fig 3c-d)

174

that differed between different conditions (Figure 3d).

175

As expected, due to limitation of the 10x Genomics scRNAseq pipeline to detect neutrophils17,

176

this population was not detected in our analysis. As reported earlier in various NHP studies

183

Receptor Expressed On Myeloid Cells (TREM) 2 gene expression (Fig 4a). For reference, we

184

annotated the most abundant IFN-responsive macrophage population as Mac_IFN_1, second

185

IFN responsive macrophage population was annotated Mac_IFN_2 and the third IFN responsive

186

macrophages with a TREM2 expression module were annotated Mac_TREM2_IFN (Fig 4a).

187

pDCs are considered the chief drivers and source of Type I IFN signature. Our prior data

188

suggested a significant influx of pDCs in BAL compartment and lungs of SARS-CoV-2 infected

189

macaques4. The pDC cluster in our current scRNAseq data was identified by expression of

190

classic pDC markers like IL3RA/CD123, CLEC4C and Transcription Factor (TCF) 4. This cluster

191

was only modestly increased at 3dpi. However, the pDC cluster contained genes associated

192

with innate response to viral pathogens like Toll-like receptors (TLR)7, TLR9 etc. along with

193

induction of Type I IFN response like Interferon Regulatory Factor (IRF) 1, IRF3, IRF7, IRF8,

194

IRF9, Derlin (DERL) 3, Solute Carrier Family 15 Member 4 (SLC15A4), with significant induction

195

in expression levels. In addition, expression of an IFN responsive transcriptional signature

196

(MX1, MX2, ISG15, ISG20, IFI6, IFI16, IFI27) was also significantly elevated in this pDC cluster

197

(Fig 4c, d). Multilabel confocal microscopy analysis validated the higher expression of IFN-α by

198

pDCs in lung tissues isolated from infected macaques at 3dpi (Fig 4e) when compared to 14-

199

17dpi and healthy macaques (Fig4e, S4).

200

Among macrophage subclusters, mac_IFN_1 was the most abundant population found in 3dpi

201

BAL samples, comprising 70 percent of myeloid cells; this population was completely absent in

202

pre-infection and during resolution at endpoint. IFN-responsive gene signature was strongly

203

upregulated in this population and the key genes which were most differentially upregulated in

204

this population were MX1, MX2, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFIT5, IFI6, IFI16, IFI44, ISG15, HERC5,

205

SIGLEC1, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3 etc. (Fig 4a). MX1 encodes a guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-

210

encode IFN-induced antiviral proteins which acts as an inhibitor of cellular as well as viral

211

processes, cell migration, proliferation, signaling, and viral replication24,25. IFI6 is one of the

212

earliest identified IFN induced gene encoding the IFN-α -inducible protein 6 which has been

213

shown to exert antiviral activity towards viruses by inhibiting the EGFR signaling pathway26-29.

214

IFI16 gene encodes the Interferon Gamma Inducible Protein 16 which has been shown to be

215

involved in the sensing of intracellular DNA and inducing death of virus infected cells30-33. IFI44

216

encodes the Interferon-Induced Protein 44 which is induced by Type 1 but not Type II IFNs and

217

has been reported to suppress viral transcription

218

(Interferon Induced proteins with Tetratricopeptide repeats) which confer antiviral state in a cell

219

by either directly binding to the viral RNA or by binding to eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) and

220

preventing eIF3 from initiating viral translational processes

221

IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3 and IFIT5 were upregulated in the mac_IFN_1 population (Fig 4a). ISG15

study has established that human macrophages and monocytes can be infected by SARS-CoV-

259

healthy macaques and switched to an IFN-responsive phenotype on 3dpi which was then

260

restored at the endpoint (Fig 3d). Mac_TREM2 cluster observed at pre-infection baseline and

261

then replenished to normal levels at endpoint (Fig 3d) demonstrated enriched expression for

266

upregulation of IFN-responsive gene signature comprising of SIGLEC1, MX, IFIT, IFI, ISG and

267

OAS genes (Fig 4a), suggesting defense response to virus as significantly enriched geneset

268

(Fig5i). In vivo validation in lungs of macaques confirmed abundance of TREM2 macrophages

269

with IFN-responsive phenotype on 3dpi (Fig 5j, S12).\

270

Mac_FOS cluster was abundant in BAL at baseline and constituted ~40-50% of myeloid cells.

271

However, this cluster was depleted at 3dpi and not restored at the endpoint tested. Mac_FOS

272

expressed high CXCL8 expression along with FOS, FOSB, NFKBIA, NFKBIZ AHR, lysozyme

273

(LYZ) and CD69. GSEA revealed that this subset expressed an inflammatory and neutrophil

274

chemotactic nature (Fig S13a), even in absence of infection in healthy macaques.

275

Mac_S100A8 cluster constituted 10% of the myeloid cells at pre-infection baseline, but was

276

absent on 3dpi and abundantly represented at the endpoint suggesting a potential role for these

277

cells in SARS-CoV-2 mediated pathology (Fig 3d). The key genes upregulated in this cluster

278

were S100 Calcium Binding Protein (S100) A4, S100A6, S100A8, S100A9, Cathelicidin

279

Antimicrobial Peptide (CAMP), Carboxypeptidase Vitellogenic Like (CPVL) (Fig4a) which

280

represent innate inflammatory immune responses, neutrophil aggregation and chemotaxis

A total of 38160 lymphoid cells were analyzed across all timepoints which distributed into 13

316

distinct clusters across the 3 timepoints studied (Fig 7a, Fig S14a,b). The populations were

317

homogenously distributed across all animals at each timepoint (Fig S14c). We noted distinctive

318

cluster alignment of all lymphoid populations based on key lymphocyte phenotype markers (Fig

319

7a,b) that differed between different conditions (Figure 7c,d). The only distinct lymphocyte

320

cluster found to be upregulated at Day 3 post infection was a T cell cluster with IFN responsive

gene signature spanning MX1, MX2, ISG15, ISG20, IFI27, IFI44, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFIT5,

322

OAS1, OAS2, HERC5 HERC6 genes and was annotated T_IFN (Fig 7d,e). Confocal analysis in

rescue TRegs from Type I IFN induced contraction

DISCUSSION

336

A thorough understanding of the host inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection is

337

needed both the identification of correlates of protection versus pathology. Such information is

338

also critical in order to identify pathways which can be precisely modulated to limit inflammation

339

without affecting protective mechanisms. Recognition of viral infections by innate immune

340

sensors activates both the Type I and Type III IFN responses. Elevated levels of IFNs have

341

been reported to correlate with and contribute to severe COVID-195,65-73. It is possible that

342

severe infection drives an uncontrolled expression of the Type I IFN response leading to

343

pathology instead of viral containment. However, inborn errors of Type I IFN in COVID-19

344

patients have been associated with life threatening conditions67,68. Similar life threatening

345

manifestation of COVID-19 has also been attributed to patients having autoantibodies against

346

type I IFNs73. It is possible that delayed or inadequate IFN responses lead to inflammation

347

mediated damage during later phases of disease. Increased induction of early Type I IFN

348

signaling pathways in SARS-CoV-2 infected macaques suggest a role for IFN signaling in

349

protection rather than disease progression4. This is further supported by the increased induction

350

of Type I IFN signaling in the cohort of young relative to geriatric macaques5, suggesting that

351

IFN induction may be compromised in older or immunocompromised hosts5,74. Thus, it is not

352

fully clear if Type I IFNs are protective or pathological in COVID-19

353

paradox to resolve, as it could lead to better therapeutic approaches for COVID-19 as well as

354

for long-term persistent COVID-19 sequelae. Elegant approaches are available to modulate the

355

signaling of this pathway in macaques75. Our studies lay the foundation of Type I IFN depletion

356

studies in this model to better understand the role of this pathway in the early control of SARS-

74

. This is an important

357

CoV-2 infection and in limiting inflammation. Further testing the protective versus pathological

358

roles of IFNs in different phases of COVID-19 in the macaque model with the availability of

359

IFNAR blocking reagents should further clarify the specific role of IFN pathways in COVID-19.

360
361

Our results unequivocally show that in protected, immunocompetent hosts, SARS-CoV-2

362

infection is characterized by an acute inflammatory response leading to a myeloid cell influx into

363

the lung compartment4 and a strong Type I IFN response5. Using state-of-the-art scRNAseq

364

approach in longitudinal BAL samples, we now demonstrate that the robust Type I IFN and

365

related cytokine response observed in the lungs of infected macaques is mediated by myeloid

366

cell subpopulations that are alveolar rather than tissue-resident in nature. In particular,

367

macrophage subpopulations Mac_IFN_1, Mac_IFN_2 and Mac_TREM2_IFN subpopulations

368

expressed high levels of IFN downstream genes both in magnitude and frequency (Fig 2). Our

369

results clearly show that induction of a robust IFN response in macrophages strongly correlates

370

with viremia (Fig S16a,b) and subsequent clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from the airways of

371

macaques (Fig S16c,d).

(Biolife Solutions, USA) at -70ºC and then used for downstream processing of scRNAseq.

513

Single cell RNA: Library generation and sequencing. scRNAseq was done according to the

514

manufacturer instructions (10x genomics) and as previously described

515

thawing the frozen BAL single cell suspension in water bath, 2X106 cells were taken for

516

downstream processing. BAL single cell suspensions were subjected to droplet-based

517

massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing using Chromium Single Cell 3’ (v3.1) Reagent Kit

518

in the BSL-3 laboratory as per manufacturer’s instructions (10x Genomics). Briefly, cell

519

suspensions were loaded at 1,000 cells/μL with the aim to capture 10,000 cells/lane. The 10x

520

Chromium Controller generated GEM droplets, where each cell was labeled with a specific

521

barcode, and each transcript labeled with a unique molecular identifier

522

transcription. The barcoded cDNA was isolated and removed from the BSL-3 space for library

523

generation. The cDNA underwent 11 cycles of amplification, followed by fragmentation, end

524

repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation, and sample index PCR as per the manufacturer’s instructions.

525

Libraries were sequenced on a NovaSeq S4 (200 cycle) flow cell, targeting 30,000 read

526

pairs/cell.

527

Single cell RNAseq: data processing. The Cell Ranger Single-Cell Software 3.0 available at

528

10x website was used to perform sample demultiplexing. We aligned resulting fastq files on

529

mmul10 genome (Genebank, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF _003339765.1/), with

530

addition of Ensembl mmul8 mitochondrial genes for GTF file with cellranger count. For each

531

sample the recovered-cells parameter was set to 10,000 cells that we expected to recover for

532

each individual library.

533

We used R package Seurat 3

534

output from cellranger count77. We filtered cells that (1) had more than 10% of mitochondrial

79

77

. Briefly, after quickly

78

during reverse

for downstream analysis of count matrixes that we got as

gene content and

536

factor of 104. The most variable genes were detected by the FindVariableFeatures function and

537

used for subsequent analysis. Latent variables (number of UMI’s and mitochondrial content)

538

were regressed out using a negative binomial model (function ScaleData). Principle component

539

analysis

540

performed on the scaled matrix (with most variable genes only) using the first 20 PCA

541

components to obtain a two-dimensional representation of the cell states. For clustering, we

542

used the functions FindNeighbors (20 PCA) and FindClusters (resolution 0.5). Identified clusters

543

were split into 2 cell groups: myeloid and lymphoid - and ran through reclustering pipeline

544

individually. For both cell subsets reclustering we performed clustering on first 20 PCA

545

component. We used clustering resolution 0.35 for myeloid and lymphoid cells reclustering. To

546

identify marker genes, we used FindAllMarkers to compare cluster against all other clusters,

547

and FindMarkers to compare selected clusters. For each cluster, only genes that were

548

expressed in more than 15% of cells with at least 0.15-fold difference were considered.

549

Heatmap representations were generated as described earlier with Phantasus software

550

(https://artyomovlab.wustl.edu/phantasus/)

551

each cluster for each sample was used.

552

Circos Plots

553

Circos plots depicting possible cell interactions were created using SingleCellSignalR 81.

554

Immunohistochemistry and Confocal Imaging:

555

To validate the findings of BAL single cell sequencing, multilabel immuno-histochemistry was

556

performed on Naïve and SARS CoV-2 infected Rhesus macaque lungs at Day 3 and Day 14

557

post infection as described 4. The lung sections were stained for macrophages with anti-CD68

558

antibody, SIGLEC1 with anti-CD169 antibody, Mac_IFN_1 signature markers with anti-MX1,

559

MX2 and ISG15 antibodies; Mac-TREM2 with anti C1q-FITC conjugated antibody and pDCs

560

with anti-HLA-DR and anti-CD123 antibodies to validate the in-vivo expression of these markers

561

in SARS CoV-2 infected lung tissue (Table S2). SARS CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody was used

562

to detect SARS CoV-2 and ACE-2 expression was confirmed using human anti-ACE2 antibody.

563

DAPI was used for nuclear staining. Images were captured using Ziess LSM-800 confocal

564

microscope.

565

Statistical Analysis:

566

Graphs were prepared and statistical comparisons were applied using GraphPad Prism

567

v8.4.3. Statistical comparisons were performed as outlined in respective methods. One-

568

way repeated measure ANOVA with Geisser Greenhouse correction for sphericity and

569

Tukey post hoc correction for multiple testing (GraphPad Prism 8.4.3) was applied for

570

statistical comparison of population clusters across timepoints as described in the figure

571

legends. For correlation analysis, Spearman’s rank tests were applied. Statistical

572

differences between groups were reported to be significant when the P value was less

573

than or equal to 0.05. Data are presented as mean + standard error of mean (SEM).
