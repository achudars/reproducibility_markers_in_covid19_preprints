Abstract
Genome-wide association studies of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have highlighted
the importance of variants associated with genes expressed by the innate immune system in
determining risk for AD. Recently, we and others have shown that genes associated with
variants that confer risk for AD are significantly enriched in transcriptional networks
expressed by amyloid-responsive microglia. This allowed us to predict new risk genes for
AD, including the interferon-responsive oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1). However, the
function of OAS1 within microglia and its genetic pathway are not known. Using genotyping
from 1,313 individuals with sporadic AD and 1,234 control individuals, we confirm that the
OAS1 variant, rs1131454, is associated with increased risk for AD and decreased OAS1
expression. Moreover, we note that the same locus was recently associated with critical
illness in response to COVID-19, linking variants that are associated with AD and a severe
response to COVID-19. By analysing single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of
isolated microglia from APPNL-G-F knock-in and wild-type C57BL/6J mice, we identify a
transcriptional network that is significantly upregulated with age and amyloid deposition, and
contains the mouse orthologue Oas1a, providing evidence that Oas1a plays an age-dependent
function in the innate immune system. We identify a similar interferon-related transcriptional
network containing OAS1 by analysing scRNA-seq data from human microglia isolated from
individuals with AD. Finally, using human iPSC-derived microglial cells (h-iPSC-Mg), we
see that OAS1 is required to limit the pro-inflammatory response of microglia. When
stimulated with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), we note that cells with lower OAS1 expression
show an exaggerated pro-inflammatory response, with increased expression and secretion of
TNF-α. Collectively, our data support a link between genetic risk for AD and susceptibility to
critical illness with COVID-19 centred on OAS1 and interferon signalling, a finding with
potential implications for future treatments of both AD and COVID-19, and the development
of biomarkers to track disease progression.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is not only characterised by extracellular amyloid-β deposits, tau
tangles and neuronal death, but also extensive neuroinflammatory changes, that may push
amyloid pathology to form tau tangles (Edwards, 2019; Ising et al., 2019; Leyns et al., 2019;
Yuan et al., 2016). Genetic studies have revealed the importance of gene variants that alter
risk for AD and are expressed by the innate immune system, including APOE, TREM2, CD33
and PLCG2 (Efthymiou and Goate, 2017; Hardy and Escott-Price, 2019; Sims et al., 2017).
Integrating genetic variants with RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and single-cell RNAsequencing (scRNA-seq) approaches has begun to provide important new insights into the
heterogeneous microglial activity changes in AD progression, particularly in the
identification of ‘disease-associated microglia’ (DAM) or ‘amyloid-responsive microglia’
(ARM) (Keren-Shaul et al., 2017; Sala Frigerio et al., 2019). This work generally postulates
that many AD risk genes, including APOE, TREM2, CD33 and PLCG2, serve in a related
pathway to allow microglia to respond to amyloid-β deposition, altered synaptic activity or
damaged phospholipid membranes to activate phagocytosis via the complement system
(Edwards, 2019; Hardy and Escott-Price, 2019; Hong et al., 2016; Parhizkar et al., 2019).
However, RNA-seq has also identified a parallel trajectory for activated microglia, distinct
from DAM/ARM, the so-called ‘interferon-response microglia’ (IRM) (Ellwanger et al.,
2021; Friedman et al., 2018; Sala Frigerio et al., 2019; Salih et al., 2019). The number of
IRM increases during normal ageing, and increases even further in response to amyloid
pathology (Friedman et al., 2018; Sala Frigerio et al., 2019). However, the mechanisms of
action of IRM in both settings are not well understood.

Interferons (IFN) are cytokines that trigger a key response to mainly viral pathogens, and
consist of three classes: type I (including IFN-α and IFN-β), type II (IFN-γ), and type III
(IFN-λ). Interferon signalling is upregulated by an amplification loop in the presence of
viruses such as influenza, hepatitis and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), leading to the restriction of viral spread, by eliciting a number of molecular
effectors to inhibit transcription of viral nucleic acids, digest viral RNA, block translation and
modify protein function (Sadler and Williams, 2008). The microglial interferon response has
recently been implicated in neuroinflammation and synapse loss in AD, however it is unclear
how interferon signalling and anti-viral immune response pathways in microglia contribute to
AD pathogenesis (Heuer et al., 2020; Mathys et al., 2019; Olah et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2020;

Sala Frigerio et al., 2019; Sebastian Monasor et al., 2020). It has been proposed that nucleic
acid-containing amyloid fibrils induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes in ADassociated mouse models, promoting the upregulation of pro-inflammatory markers and
complement cascade-dependent synaptic elimination (Di Domizio et al., 2012; Roy et al.,
2020). Another potential contributor to interferon signalling is the DNA-sensing receptor
cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) and its downstream mediator STimulator of INterferon
Genes (STING; cGAS-STING pathway), which respond to not only pathogen-derived nucleic
acids but also mitochondrial and genomic nucleic acids derived from stressed, senescent or
dying cells in the CNS (Motwani et al., 2019; Paul et al., 2020). While type I interferon
signalling was reported to be associated with microglial activation patterns and AD, there are
implications that type II interferon signalling also contributes to neuroinflammation and AD
pathogenesis (Deczkowska et al., 2016; Majoros et al., 2017; Taylor et al., 2018).

The molecular machinery that drives anti-viral responses includes interferon receptors
(IFNAR and IFNGR), tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), IFN-stimulated protein of 15 kDa (ISG15,
involved in an ubiquitin-like pathway), Mx GTPases (myxovirus resistance), protein kinase R
(PKR; also known as eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 2, EIF2αK2), and
the 2’,5’-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-regulated ribonuclease L. Stimulation of interferon
receptors leads to JAK-STAT signalling and induction of expression of interferon-stimulated
genes, including OAS1 from IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) in their promoters,
resulting in the activation of RNase L which in turn degrades cellular and viral RNA
(Donovan et al., 2013; Silverman, 2007). It has recently become apparent that the OAS
proteins may also have additional functions that are independent of RNase L activity
(Kristiansen et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2019; Li et al., 2016). It has also been shown that OAS1 is
involved in the regulation of cytokine expression (Lee et al., 2019). We recently identified
OAS1 as a putative new risk gene for AD, by integrating DNA sequence variation at the
gene-level from human genome-wide association studies (GWAS), associated with AD and a
high-resolution RNA-seq transcriptome network expressed by mouse amyloid-responsive
microglia (Salih et al., 2019). The amyloid-responsive microglial transcriptome contains
several genes involved in interferon signalling, including other Oas genes, the interferon
receptor Ifnar2 and the coiled-coil alpha-helical rod protein 1, Cchcr1. In parallel work,
recent GWAS studies have shown that several genes including OAS1, IFNAR2 and CCHCR
involved in interferon signalling also contribute to the genetic risk associated with critical

outcomes of COVID-19 and requirement for intensive care (Pairo-Castineira et al., 2021;
Schmiedel et al., 2020). Deleterious gene variants have also been described in a number of
genes involved in interferon signalling, including IFNAR1, IFNAR2 and IRF7 in patients with
life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia in an independent study (Zhang et al., 2020). Indeed,
neutralising autoantibodies against interferons have been identified in individuals with lifethreatening COVID-19, where these antibodies dampen the interferon response (Bastard et
al., 2020). These findings implicate the significance of interferon signalling pathways that
could exacerbate the progression of AD and the severity of COVID-19.

Similar to neurological manifestations caused by other respiratory viruses including influenza
virus and human respiratory syncytial virus (Bohmwald et al., 2018), the latest reports state
that as many as 36-78% of people hospitalised with COVID-19 display neurological
symptoms including encephalopathy, acute ischaemic cerebrovascular syndrome and
neuropsychiatric manifestations (Mao et al., 2020; Paterson et al., 2020; Romero-Sánchez et
al., 2020; Woo et al., 2020). Although it is controversial whether SARS-CoV-2 is detectable
in the CSF, the virus uses the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a key receptor for
entry that is expressed by the endothelium of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), epithelial cells of
the choroid plexus, and at a lower level by astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and nerve terminals
(such as those of the olfactory system, which may allow retrograde spread) (Butowt and von
Bartheld, 2020; Chen et al., 2020b; Desforges et al., 2014; Paniz-Mondolfi et al., 2020).
There is accumulating evidence that these brain structures and cells are infected with SARSCoV-2 and are altering the cytokine profile of the brain (Matschke et al., 2020; Yang et al.,
2020). Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumour necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 in severe COVID-19 patients (Chen et al., 2020a;
Chevrier et al., 2021; Hadjadj et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Keddie et al., 2020; Lee et al.,
2020; Qin et al., 2020), trigger an inflammatory cascade leading to cell death. Consequently,
a blunted response by the interferon signalling pathway against pathogens implicates a higher
risk for developing AD and severe COVID-19. Thus, it is clear that investigating interferon
pathways involved in anti-viral responses will: (i) benefit our understanding of pathways
involved in the progression of AD and infectious diseases like COVID-19, and (ii) may
provide new information for therapeutic approaches and identification of biomarkers to
follow disease progression.

In this study, our genotyping analysis confirms that the single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) rs1131454 within OAS1 is significantly associated with AD. We find that SNPs within
OAS1 associated with AD also show linkage disequilibrium (LD) with SNP variants
associated with critical illness in COVID-19. Additionally, investigating the transcriptome
expressed by microglia, we find a genetic co-expression network consisting of genes in
interferon response pathways including OAS1 and the mouse orthologue Oas1a are expressed
in ageing mice, in mice with amyloid pathology, and in humans with AD and mild cognitive
impairment (MCI). Finally, we see that reducing the expression of OAS1 using siRNA in
human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) cells differentiated to microglia, results in an
exaggerated pro-inflammatory response when stimulated with IFN-γ. Understanding the
mechanisms by which OAS1 pathways bridge interferon and pro-inflammatory signalling in
innate immune cells will be important to gain new insights into the progression of AD and
severe/critical outcomes associated with COVID-19, and how to treat and track these
diseases.

Materials and Methods
Genotyping
DNA samples (n=2,547) were kindly obtained from six research institutes in the United
Kingdom that are part of the Alzheimer's Research UK (ARUK) Network. The ARUK series
of samples included here are from Bristol, Leeds, Manchester, Nottingham, Oxford and
Southampton (further details are given in the Acknowledgements). This ARUK series has not
been included in the IGAP consortium study and consisted of confirmed or probable AD
diagnosis (n=1,313) and controls (n=1,234). Demographics for these samples are in Table 1.
Since all demographic variables were found to be significantly different between the cases
and controls (p<0.0001), they were included as covariates in the subsequent analyses. The
effects of covariates between cases and controls were tested for age (using a Student’s t-test),
and APOE status and sex (using chi-squared tests). Samples were genotyped in-house using a
TaqMan genotyping assay for rs1131454 following standard protocols (Applied Biosystems);
the genotyping rate for the samples was 69.7%. Association of the SNP with AD was
conducted using logistic regression correcting for the covariates with the statistical analysis
program PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007).

SNPs in the locus containing OAS1 associated with AD (Salih et al., 2018, 2019), and
COVID (Pairo-Castineira et al., 2021), were illustrated with LocusZoom (Pruim et al., 2010).
Allele frequencies and LD between these SNPs were investigated using the 1000Genomes
Phase 3 data (European populations, CEU and GBR; Auton et al., 2015), and LDlink
(Machiela and Chanock, 2015; Myers et al., 2020), where the LD between SNPs was
calculated with the LDpair tool (available at https://ldlink.nci.nih.gov/?tab=ldpair using data
from European populations, CEU, TSI and GBR).

RNA-seq data pre-processing
The scRNA-seq datasets were generated from microglia isolated from: i) hippocampi of 3, 6,
12, and 21 month old APPNL-G-F and WT mice (Sala Frigerio et al., (2019), denoted SF data;
non-hippocampal samples were removed), and, ii) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of human
individuals with AD or MCI (Olah et al., (2020), denoted OL data; epilepsy samples and
clusters of cells identified by the authors to express high levels of non-microglial or

dissociation-induced genes were removed). Data were filtered to remove cells which
appeared either unhealthy (>5% ratio of mitochondrial to total unique molecular identifiers
(UMIs) for both datasets; <30,000 UMIs or <1,000 genes detected for SF data; <1,000 UMIs
or < 700 genes detected for OL data), or potential doublets (>1,000,000 UMIs for SF data;
>100,000 UMIs for OL data) using Seurat’s subset function (Stuart et al., 2019). Counts were
normalised using Seurat’s SCTransform function with the method set to glmGamPoi, while
regressing out batch effects between sequencing plates with the vars.to.regress argument
(Hafemeister and Satija, 2019), returning both log-normalised corrected counts and corrected
Pearson’s residuals. Genes not reliably detected were removed (zero log-normalised
corrected counts in >95% of cells in every cluster of cells assigned by the original authors).
Finally, genes showing low variation in expression between cells (coefficient of variation for
Pearson’s residuals <15%) were removed, as they are not informative for co-expression
analysis.

Bulk RNA-seq datasets generated from microglia isolated from aged and adult wild-type
mice (O’Neil et al., 2018), or wild-type and PSEN2/APP mice (PS2APP line; Friedman et al.,
2018), were normalised using DeSeq2’s estimatesizefactors function and transformed by
log2(normalised counts+1) (Love et al., 2014). Genes with an average detection level <1.5
normalised counts were removed.

Co-expression network analysis
Co-expression analysis was performed on pre-processed Pearson’s residuals of the scRNAseq data from Sala Frigerio et al. (2019), and Olah et al. (2020), using CoExpNets’
getDownstreamNetwork function. CoExpNets is an optimisation of the popular weighted
gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) package (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008),
which uses an additional k-means clustering step to reassign genes to more appropriate
modules, producing more biologically relevant and reproducible modules (Botía et al., 2017).
The expression of the interferon-response modules was represented by averaging expression
of the 60 most central module genes in microglia isolated from aged versus young adult wildtype mice, and PSEN2/APP versus wild-type mice, and by applying Student’s t-test (the 60
most central module genes were ranked by module membership scores calculated by

al. (2018) datasets, respectively.

Pseudotime analysis
To infer Pseudotime trajectories of microglial activation, we followed the standard workflow
of the Monocle 2 R package (Qiu et al., 2017; Trapnell et al., 2014), to calculate single-cell
trajectories by ordering cells by their expression of the 1,000 genes most significantly
differentially expressed between cell clusters (ranked by qvalue), previously identified by
Sala Frigerio et al. (2019).

Cell culture
Human iPSC-derived microglia cells (h-iPSC-Mg) were generated from the BIONi010-C
human iPSC line (EBiSC), originating from a non-demented, normal male (15-19 years old).
Differentiation to h-iPSC-Mg was essentially as described by Xiang et al. (2018). Briefly, the
protocol was as follows: embryoid body differentiation media for 2 days (consisted of
Essential 8, 50 ng/ml BMP-4, 50 ng/ml VEGF, 20 ng/ml SCF, and 10 µM Y-27632), then
myeloid differentiation media for 30 days (consisted of X-VIVO 15 medium (Lonza),
Glutamax (Life Technologies), 100 U/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin (Life Technologies), 50
µM β-mercaptoethanol (Life Technologies), 100 ng/ml MCSF (Peprotech), and 25 ng/ml IL3 (Cell Guidance Systems)). These myeloid cells were seeded at a density of 5x105 cells/well
in 6-well plates, followed by microglial differentiation media for 13 days (consisted of:
DMEM/F12 HEPES no phenol red, 2% ITS-G (Life Technologies), 1% N2 supplement (Life
Technologies), 200 µM monothioglycerol (Sigma), Glutamax, NEAA (Life Technologies), 5
µg/ml Insulin (Sigma), 100 ng/ml IL-34 (Peprotech), 25 ng/ml MCSF and 5 ng/ml TGFβ-1
(Peprotech)) and finally, microglia maturation media for 4 days (consisted of: microglial
differentiation media plus 100 ng/ml CD200 (Generon), and 100 ng/ml CX3CL1
(Peprotech)).

siRNA transfection
H-iPSC-Mg were treated with 125 μl Opti-MEM containing 3.75 μl lipofectamine

efficiency of 70-95% for OAS1 knockdown in h-iPSC-Mg. OAS1 siRNA-1: sense 5’

to microglial maturation media. Cells were harvested for RNA extraction 24±1 hr after
transfection.

Interferon-γ treatment
H-iPSC-Mg were treated with 33 ng/ml human IFN-γ (#AF-300-02, PeproTech), at 4 hr
following siRNA transfection.

RNA extraction & cDNA synthesis
Prior to lysis, h-iPSC-Mg cells were washed with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline
(DPBS). Total RNA was extracted using the Monarch Total RNA Miniprep Kit (#T2010S,
NEB), following the manufacturer’s guidelines. The total RNA quantity and purity (A260/A280
ratio) were assessed with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For
further reduction of contaminating genomic DNA, equal amounts of RNA were treated with
DNase I amplification grade (#18068015, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and RNaseOUT
recombinant ribonuclease inhibitor (#10777019, Thermo Fisher Scientific). All RNA samples
were reverse transcribed using the LunaScript™ RT supermix kit (#E3010L, NEB),
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In parallel, negative controls were generated with
the same procedure except the reverse transcriptase was omitted from the master mix (RTnegative control).

Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
Primers for genes of interest were designed using Primer-BLAST (NCBI) to test their
specificity against the whole human transcriptome. Primers were tested in two-steps. The first
step was to resolve the products of a standard PCR on a 3% agarose gel in Tris-acetate-EDTA

gel stained with SYBR safe (Thermo Fisher Scientific), to assess the correct product size and
presence of only one product. The second step was to test the primers with RT-qPCR using
SYBR green to check the linearity range of a dilution series of cDNA template, to test primer
efficiency (90-105%), and to confirm primer specificity using a melt curve. Primers with
good efficiency were selected (Table S1).

Each RT-qPCR reaction had 1.5 µl of cDNA, 0.25 μM forward and reverse primers, 5 µl of
Luna® universal qPCR master mix (#M3003L, NEB), and 3 µl of nuclease-free water. The
reactions of each sample across the different conditions were loaded in triplicates with a RTnegative control sample. The reactions were run in 384-well plates on a LightCycler® 480
real-time PCR system (Roche) with cycling conditions of 95◦C for 5 min (preincubation), 45
cycles of [95◦C for 10 sec, 60◦C for 30 sec] (amplification), 95◦C for 5 sec, 65◦C for 1 min,
raised to 97◦C (ramp rate 0.11◦C per sec) (melting curve). The product specificity of all
reactions was confirmed by the melt-curve analysis, where samples gave only a single peak
and RT-negative control samples gave no signal. For normalisation of gene expression levels,
the stability of internal control reference genes was tested to ensure the reference genes used
were stable across siRNA and IFN-γ treatment. The highest stability was seen with the
geometric mean of Ct values of RPS18, GAPDH, and HPRT1. Gene expression analyses were
performed by following the GeNorm method (Salih et al., 2012; Vandesompele et al., 2002).

ELISA of TNF-α secreted by h-iPSC-Mg
For ELISA analyses, supernatants from h-iPSC-Mg cultures were collected, centrifuged to
remove cell debris and stored at -20°C. TNF-α levels were quantified using the Quantikine
human TNF-α ELISA kit (DTA00D, R&D Systems), following the manufacturer's
instructions. In general, equal volumes of cell supernatants, together with the provided buffer,
were loaded in duplicates to the ELISA microplate and incubated for 2 hr at RT. Following
four washes, wells were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated human TNFα antibody for another 2 hr at RT. The microplate was washed again and incubated with a
substrate solution prepared with chromogen (TMB) and hydrogen peroxide for 30 min before
addition of a stop solution with sulphuric acid. Then the colour intensity was measured at 450
nm, and 540 nm to assess the background signal, using a FLUOstar Omega microplate reader

Statistical analyses for cell culture experiments
All statistical analyses were conducted on GraphPad Prism 9. For experiments with h-iPSCMg under basal conditions, comparisons between multiple groups were analysed by using
repeated-measures one-way ANOVA (repeated for wells treated with different siRNA in the
same plate) followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons tests comparing every test group
with the negative control group. For experiments with h-iPSC-Mg in response to IFN-γ
treatment and siRNA treatments, comparisons between factors were tested with two-way
ANOVA followed with Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests to compare all possible
permutations of sample groups. Significant differences were indicated as follows: *p<0.05,

Results
SNPs associated with OAS1 are linked to risk for AD and critical illness with COVID-19
Our recent work overlapping the mouse amyloid-associated transcriptome network (bulk
RNA-seq) with human gene-level-aggregated AD risk variants, identified a microglial coexpression network, whose eigengene strongly correlated with the level of amyloid-β
pathology and contained the mouse orthologues of many known human GWAS loci
(including TREM2 and APOE) (Salih et al., 2019). Our recent work also predicted the
importance of several previously unidentified risk genes, including OAS1, and demonstrated
a colocalisation between AD risk loci and eQTLs regulating OAS1 expression in: (i) human
iPSC-derived macrophages stimulated with a combination of IFN-γ and salmonella, and (ii)
human monocytes stimulated with LPS or 5′-triphosphate double-stranded RNA (Alasoo et
al., 2018; Kim-Hellmuth et al., 2017; Salih et al., 2019). To further evaluate AD-associated
genetic variation in OAS1, we genotyped the top SNP, rs1131454, identified by our genelevel analysis of the Lambert et al. GWAS (Lambert et al., 2013). SNP rs1131454 was
genotyped in 1,313 individuals with sporadic AD and 1,234 control individuals that were not
included in the original cohort from Lambert et al. (2013). We found a significant association
of rs1131454 with AD in this independent cohort of AD and control individuals (Table 1).

To determine whether AD-associated SNPs in close proximity to OAS1 were in LD with
recently identified SNPs related to critical outcomes with COVID-19 (Pairo-Castineira et al.,
2021), we used the 1000Genomes Phase 3 database (CEU and GBR populations; Auton et al.,
2015) (Fig. 1A and 1B). We saw a strong LD (r2=0.63-0.99 and D’=0.91-1.0) between our
two top SNPs adjacent to OAS1, rs1131454 (identified using data from Lambert et al.
(2013)), and rs4766676 (identified using data from Kunkle et al. (2019)), and two SNPs
associated with severe COVID-19 responses, rs6489867 and rs10735079 (Pairo-Castineira et
al., 2021) using LDpair. This suggests that four risk alleles adjacent to the OAS1 and OAS3
genes may form a haplotype that contributes to both risk for AD and a severe response with
COVID-19. Together with results from our previous AD-associated colocalisation analyses
(Salih et al., 2019), the recent transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) for critically ill
COVID-19 patients, suggests that there may be complex or pleiotropic variant(s) within the
OAS gene cluster that modulates risk for both diseases potentially via regulation of OAS1 or
OAS3 expression (Pairo-Castineira et al., 2021; Salih et al., 2019; Schmiedel et al., 2020).

Genetic co-expression network involving interferon response genes is increased with
ageing and amyloid plaques
To understand how the expression of OAS1 relates to microglial activation states, we initially
assessed the expression of its mouse orthologue, Oas1a, in microglia isolated from APPNL-G-F
knock-in and wild-type C57BL/6J mice at 3 to 21 months of age, profiled by scRNA-seq
(Sala Frigerio et al., 2019). We identified a co-expression transcriptomic network containing
Oas1a by utilising a modified version of WGCNA, which produces more biologically
relevant co-expression networks (Fig. 2A). The module containing Oas1a displayed many
interferon-responsive genes (Ifit1, Ifit2, Ifit3, Ifitm3, Stat1, Stat2, Usp18 and Mx1), as
expected, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Tnf) (Table S2). We then generated a twobranched diffusion trajectory by semi-supervised pseudotime analysis, to visualise two
different activation states ARM and IRM derived from homeostatic microglia (Fig. 2B). This
revealed that Oas1a and the interferon response module were upregulated in microglia that
transition along one branch of this trajectory towards the IRM state (Fig. 2C). This module
showed increased expression in microglia isolated and pooled (bulk RNA-seq) from aged
wild-type mice compared to young mice (Fig. 2D). Moreover, this interferon module showed
increased expression in microglial isolated and pooled from PSEN2/APP mice relative to
wild-type mice (Fig. 2E). Importantly, performing similar analyses in microglia isolated from
human brains with AD (Olah et al., 2020), we identified a related IRM network containing
OAS1 and other interferon responsive genes (overlap with mouse IRM network p=3.7e-13,
Fisher’s Exact test) (Fig. 2F) (Table S3). These findings suggest that a discrete population of
interferon-responsive microglia defined by co-expression of OAS1 and pro-inflammatory
cytokines may play a role in amyloidosis, as well as ageing, the major risk factor for AD and
COVID-19 (Guerreiro and Bras, 2015; Ou et al., 2020).

OAS1 coordinates the pro-inflammatory response of human iPSC derived microglia
To study the function of OAS1 in human microglia, we used siRNA to knockdown expression
of OAS1 in h-iPSC-Mg. We obtained knockdown of OAS1 expression to around 30-40% of
endogenous levels under non-stimulated conditions (Fig. S1). Under these basal conditions,
the expression profiles of commonly used markers covering various microglial functions
including homeostasis, phagocytosis, pro- and anti-inflammatory signalling, and genes from
the interferon-responsive networks, generally remained unchanged by OAS1 knockdown in hiPSC-Mg. In response to IFN-γ treatment, OAS1 expression increased by around 3.5-fold, and

OAS1 knockdown with siRNA was still effective in the presence of IFN-γ (Fig. 3A).
Treatment with IFN-γ also induced the expression of pro-inflammatory marker TNF by
around 30-fold in h-iPSC-Mg, but with OAS1 knockdown the induction of TNF was further
significantly increased to around 45-fold compared to control cells treated with non-targeting
siRNA (Fig. 3B). We confirmed the increased secretion of TNF-α into the h-iPSC-Mg culture
media in samples with OAS1 knockdown in the presence of IFN-γ compared to cells treated
with non-targeting siRNA and IFN-γ (Fig. 3C). At the same time, C1QA expression showed a
significant but modest increase with OAS1 knockdown (Fig. 3D). Treatment with IFN-γ
resulted in increased expression of TGFB1, CD68, P2RY12, IFITM3 and STAT1, decreased
expression of TREM2, and had no effect on IL1B, ITGAM and CD163 expression, with OAS1
knockdown not altering the expression of these genes (Fig. S2). Therefore, OAS1 appeared to
dampen the pro-inflammatory response involving TNF-α following IFN-γ stimulation, with a
modest effect on dampening the expression of C1QA complement.

Discussion
GWAS studies have revealed the importance of innate immune cells in moderating the risk of
AD, with the discovery of variants in genes such as TREM2, CD33 and PLCG2. A number of
studies have shown that several of these genes are likely involved in the same signalling
pathway or functioning in the same sub-population of microglia to control their activation to
a so-called DAM or ARM state (Griciuc et al., 2019; Keren-Shaul et al., 2017; Krasemann et
al., 2017; Sala Frigerio et al., 2019). These DAM or ARM cells are thought to regulate
complement-dependent phagocytosis of synapses, which may be dependent on phospholipid
signals presented on damaged cell membranes (Edwards, 2019; Györffy et al., 2018; Hardy
and Escott-Price, 2019; Hong et al., 2016; Scott-Hewitt et al., 2020). Emerging data is also
indicating that other sub-populations of microglia play a significant role in AD and ageing,
particularly the IRM cells, and may also express genes that confer risk for AD (Friedman et
al., 2018; Olah et al., 2020; Sala Frigerio et al., 2019; Salih et al., 2019). We recently
identified the interferon-responsive gene OAS1 as a putative risk gene for AD by combining
transcriptional changes in the presence of amyloid plaques and gene-level variation from
GWAS data (Salih et al., 2019). Here, we confirm that rs1131454 within OAS1 is associated
with AD when we genotype an independent cohort of 1,313 individuals with AD and 1,234
control individuals. Additionally, we show that rs1131454 is in LD with newly identified
SNPs associated with critical illness due to COVID-19, suggesting that the same locus
regulates the risk for both AD and severe outcomes with COVID-19. Furthermore, by
building genetic transcriptome networks using scRNA-seq of isolated mouse microglia, we
show that an interferon response pathway containing the mouse orthologue of Oas1a exhibits
increased expression during ageing in microglia. This indicates that the expression of the
interferon pathway occurs within a specific sub-population of innate immune cells and
contributes to age-dependent changes that may predispose or protect some people in the
population against these age-related diseases. We identify a related network of interferonresponsive genes containing OAS1 in human microglia isolated post-mortem from individuals
with AD. Finally, with functional experiments using h-iPSC-Mg, we show that OAS1 levels
moderate the pro-inflammatory response of myeloid cells in response to elevated interferon
levels. Thus, individuals with lower levels of OAS1 due to eQTL variants can be more likely
to show a strong pro-inflammatory response to AD-associated pathology and COVID-19,
triggering damage and cell death in neighbouring cells such as neurons and alveolar cells, by
initiating a ‘cytokine storm.’

The data presented here provide support for OAS1 linking AD and critical illness with
COVID-19 by controlling the pro-inflammatory output of myeloid cells. OAS1 is an
oligoadenylate synthetase enzyme that binds dsRNA and changes conformation to generate
oligoadenylates and activate RNase L to digest RNA (Schwartz and Conn, 2019; Schwartz et
al., 2020). It has also been proposed that OAS1 may also have RNase-independent roles
(Kristiansen et al., 2010; Li et al., 2016). OAS1 is expressed by multiple cell types in the
myeloid lineage including monocytes, macrophages, natural killer cells and microglia
(Alasoo et al., 2018; Kim-Hellmuth et al., 2017; Schmiedel et al., 2018, 2020). Here, we
show that rs1131454 within OAS1 is associated with AD, and previously we showed that this
locus acts as an eQTL regulating the expression of OAS1 in monocytes and iPSCmacrophages stimulated with 5’-triphosphate dsRNA and a combination of IFN-γ and
salmonella, respectively (Salih et al., 2019). Also in that locus is OAS2, which was
independently shown to be associated with AD (Broce et al., 2019; Kuksa et al., 2020).
Recent work has identified other SNPs close to this locus associated with severe responses to
COVID-19 that also act as eQTLs and regulate the expression of OAS1, OAS3 and other
distal genes such as DTX1 (Pairo-Castineira et al., 2021; Schmiedel et al., 2020). Indeed, a
series of different variants have been identified within OAS1 that modify susceptibility to
infection with SARS-CoV-2, other viruses such as hepatitis C, developing type 1 diabetes,
and multiple sclerosis; these variants have been proposed to cause amino acid changes,
altered splicing (spliceQTLs) and altered expression (eQTLs) (Bonnevie-Nielsen et al., 2005;
Cagliani et al., 2012; He et al., 2006; Klaassen et al., 2020; Randolph et al., 2020; Tessier et
al., 2006; Zeberg and Pääbo, 2021). A recent study has identified a haplotype of
approximately 75 kb centred around the OAS locus inherited from Neandertals that is
protective against COVID-19 (Zeberg and Pääbo, 2021), suggesting that there has been
genetic selection at this locus during European history. Given the variety of SNPs associated
with OAS1 and their influence on diseases related to innate immune function, this suggests
that these SNPs tag a complex and/or pleiotropic genetic variant that alters the expression of
OAS1, as opposed to a variant that alters OAS1 enzyme activity. The different SNPs tagging
the OAS1 variant may be in different chromosomal positions in different people, with
different effect sizes. It is also possible that varying LD in individuals within different studies
and populations result in the true causal variant being tagged by different SNPs in different
people and studies. Several studies described here show altered expression of OAS1

associated with these SNPs. Another possibility that has been proposed is that different SNPs
within this locus differentially regulate the expression of genes within this cluster in different
immune cells based on chromatin conformation (Schmiedel et al., 2020), although further
work needs to be done to test the effects of different variants in other immune cell types
including microglia and other tissue-specific macrophages, such as alveolar macrophages.

Lowering the expression of OAS1 using siRNA to mimic the effects of an eQTL
demonstrated that OAS1 is required to dampen the expression and release of proinflammatory marker TNF-α when the levels of IFN-γ increase. Thus, individuals with eQTL
variants that result in lower levels of OAS1 expression may show more severe disease
phenotypes associated with both AD and COVID-19, as a result of increased TNF-α and
other pro-inflammatory cytokines. TNF-α and IFN-γ have been shown to have a synergistic
effect on cell death (Karki et al., 2020), and so could damage nearby neurons and alveolar
cells. TNF-α with C1Q complement (which also shows elevated expression in our h-iPSCMg system in response to OAS1 knockdown), has been shown to induce the activation of
reactive astrocytes, which contribute to synaptic damage, phagocytosis, and death of neurons
and oligodendrocytes (Liddelow et al., 2017). Previously, we and others have shown that proinflammatory signals also suppress the expression of Trem2 via TLR4 receptors (Liu et al.,
2020; Owens et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2019). Our data is consistent with
the suppression of TREM2 expression as a response to IFN-γ and TNF-α in h-iPSC-Mg.
Given that TREM2 is likely to have a protective role in AD and slow disease progression,
elevated pro-inflammatory signals could increase the risk and progression of AD by
suppressing this protective signal. TNF-α also activates PKR/ EIF2αK2, which is downstream
of interferon signalling via TLR4, and consequently the protein activator of the IFN-inducible
protein kinase (PRKRA) leading to apoptosis (Moradi Majd et al., 2020; Sadler and
Williams, 2008). Altogether, chronic elevation of IFN signalling and subsequent TNF-α
release could contribute to the development of dementia.

Pseudotime and network analysis of microglia isolated from APPNL-G-F and wild-type
C57BL/6J mice across a variety of ages identified that Oas1a was upregulated alongside a
co-expression network associated with interferon and pro-inflammatory responses expressed
by a distinct sub-population of microglia transitioning to the interferon-related IRM state.

This network contained Oas1a (the mouse orthologue of OAS1 with 68% identity at the
protein level), other Oas family members, Mx1, Stat1/2, Ifit3, Ifitm3 and Usp18 as hub genes.
The expression of this network of genes was increased with age in wild-type mice. This
finding suggests that the upregulation of interferon-responsive genes with age might mitigate
the age-related damage by limiting pro-inflammatory signalling. Any dysfunction due to
genetic variants in interferon signalling could result in persistent pro-inflammatory signalling
and/or suppression of protective genes such as TREM2 which could lead to dementia or
severe COVID-19. Age is one of the strongest risk factors for severe COVID-19 responses
and AD (Guerreiro and Bras, 2015; Ou et al., 2020), and so understanding the function of this
genetic network will be important to attenuate the age-dependent contribution to these
diseases.

The interferon-responsive genes seen in aged mice, and mice with amyloid plaques, were also
expressed in a specific sub-population of microglia that are present in brains from people
with AD (Olah et al. 2020). The genetic network we identified in human brains with AD
containing OAS1 and other interferon-responsive genes, identified IFITM3, CD163, and
ISG15 as hub genes. CD163 is a marker of a subset of border‐associated macrophages
(BAMs), that are present at the borders of the brain, including the meninges and choroid
plexus, and is thought to represent an anti-inflammatory state in these cells, indicating the
resolution of inflammation (Dvir-Szternfeld et al., 2021; Pey et al., 2014; De Schepper et al.,
2020; Zhang et al., 2011). Indeed, emerging evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is able to
infect the brain vasculature, meninges, and choroid plexus (Yang et al., 2020), which would
result in activation of BAMs and alter the cytokine environment around the brain leading to
BBB breakdown, infiltration of immune cells into the brain, activation of astrocytes and
phagocytosis of neurons. Coupling these findings with the high incidence of neurological
problems in people showing a severe COVID-19 response (Mao et al., 2020; Paterson et al.,
2020; Romero-Sánchez et al., 2020; Woo et al., 2020), emphasises the urgency with which
we need to understand the mechanisms underlying the changes to cytokine signalling
regulated by interferon signalling, particularly to anticipate the long-term neurological
consequences of COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2020a). In addition to COVID-19, a SNP within
OAS1 was also associated with type 1 diabetes and so OAS1 may integrate multiple risk
factors that contribute to critical outcomes with COVID-19 (Tessier et al., 2006).

Surveying the genetic network we have identified containing OAS1, there are a number of
secreted factors that may be useful as a readout of the state of these specialised innate
immune cells in blood or CSF. The secreted genes include: CXCL14, EGFL7, F13A1, ISG15,
SCRG1, TGFBI and TNFSF13B. The identification of OAS1 and OAS3 as genes that
coordinate the response to amyloid-β plaques and COVID-19 infection poses the use of
phosphodiesterase 12 (PDE12) inhibitors to increase the activity of OAS enzymes for these
diseases, since PDE12 degrades the oligoadenylate activator of the OAS/RNase L system
(Wood et al., 2015). PDE12 inhibitor compounds or PDE12 knockout increase the anti-viral
activity of cells. Furthermore, administration of interferons with correct timing may also help
to dampen the pro-inflammatory response of innate immune cells, as in the treatment of
multiple sclerosis (Davoudi-Monfared et al., 2020; Kingwell et al., 2019; Lee and Shin, 2020;
Wang et al., 2020b).

In conclusion, our data show that OAS1 is required to limit the pro-inflammatory response of
myeloid cells when stimulated with IFN-γ. We also identify a SNP within OAS1 associated
with AD in the same locus that predisposes to critical illness with COVID-19. This SNP acts
as an eQTL, and is common in the population, and so may contribute to the high incidence of
AD or critical illness with COVID-19 in the population. Further investigation of the function
of OAS1 in innate immune cells and the genetic network engaged by OAS1 will provide
better molecular targets to track disease progression and treat AD, as well as COVID-19 and
potentially its long-term sequelae.

Sample demographic and association result for the genotyping carried out on SNP rs1131454
within the OAS1 gene using the IGAP independent samples from the ARUK DNA bank.
*Covariates for AD including age at death (AAD), sex and presence of APOE E4 alleles were
found to be significantly different between cases and controls (P<0.0001). $The association of
the G allele for a protective effect was significant after controlling for covariates.

FIGURE 1. The genomic position of four SNPs on 12q24: rs1131454 and rs4766676
(associated with AD) and rs10735079 and rs6489867 (associated with critical illness with
COVID-19) relative to OAS1. (A) We have confirmed rs1131454 is associated with AD
(Table 1) following our analysis of AD GWAS data (our data is given in Salih et al. (2018),
which was derived from further analysis of the GWAS data in Lambert et al. (2013)). We
identified the association of rs4766676 with AD (our data is given in Salih et al. (2019),
which was derived from further analysis of the GWAS data in Kunkle et al. (2019)). SNPs
rs10735079 and rs6489867 are associated with severe illness with COVID-19 (PairoCastineira et al., 2020). The R2 scale indicates LD between rs1131454 (the reference SNP,
purple), compared to the other three SNPs. Drawn with LocusZoom (Pruim et al., 2010). (B)
Strong correlation between the SNPs associated with AD and COVID-19 suggesting they
might form part of a haplotype group. Allele frequency at these SNPs was investigated using
the 1000Genomes Phase 3 data (CEU and GBR populations; Auton et al., 2015) and LDlink
(Machiela and Chanock, 2015; Myers et al., 2020).

FIGURE 2. An interferon-response associated gene module is present along a distinct
microglial activation trajectory upregulated in aged mice, mice with amyloid pathology
and in humans with AD. A) The genetic network containing Oas1a from microglial cells
isolated from wild-type and APPNL-G-F KI mice at 3, 6, 12 and 21 months of age analysed by
scRNA-seq (Sala Frigerio et al., 2019). The 50 genes showing the highest connectivity are
plotted, and Oas1a is highlighted. Green nodes represent genes, edge lines represent coexpression connections, and the central large red nodes are the hub genes (full network given
in Table S2). (B) Semi-supervised pseudotime ordering of microglial cells isolated from
wild-type and APPNL-G-F KI mice as above based on expression (Sala Frigerio et al., 2019),
with Monocle 2, shows homeostatic cells as the root state, and ARM and IRM as the
endpoints of distinct activation trajectories. C) The gene module containing Oas1a is
upregulated along the IRM-associated activation trajectory. The expression of this module is
relatively absent from both the root homeostatic state and the ARM trajectory. D) Mean
normalised expression of the 60 most central genes in the interferon response module is
greater in microglia isolated from aged wild-type relative to young adult mice (6-8-weeks
versus 16-18-months of age; N=6 mice per group. Data shown as mean ± SEM. Student’s ttest; **p<0.01. Further analysis of data from O’Neil et al. (2018)). E) Mean normalised
expression of the 60 most central genes in the interferon response module is greater in
microglia isolated from PSEN2/APP relative to wild-type mice at 14-15-months of age (N=69 mice per group. Data shown as mean ± SEM. Student’s t-test; ****p<0.0001. Further
analysis of data from Friedman et al. (2018)). F) Genetic network plot of an interferonresponse associated module detected in microglial cells isolated from human AD patients and
individuals with MCI (Olah et al., 2020). This module shows a significant overlap with the
interferon-response module detected in mice (see panel A) (full network given in Table S3).
The hub gene of this module is CD163, and a number of other macrophage marker genes are
prominent within this module (MSR1, TGFB1, F13A1, LY6E and LYZ), indicating that
expression of OAS1 and other interferon-response genes in the human AD patient brain are
either associated with a population of CNS border-associated or invading macrophages, or
potentially a microglial subpopulation which upregulates anti-inflammatory genes. OAS1 is
highlighted.

ANOVA with significant main effects of IFN-γ treatment (p<0.01), and siRNA treatment
(p<0.001) indicated as horizontal and vertical red lines, respectively, with a significant
interaction (p<0.001). (B) TNF expression, as a marker of the pro-inflammatory response,
showed significant up-regulation in response to IFN-γ application, and accentuated
expression with OAS1 knockdown. Two-way ANOVA with significant main effects of IFN-γ
treatment (p<0.001), and siRNA treatment (p=0.015) indicated as horizontal and vertical red
lines, respectively, with a significant interaction (p=0.023). (C) ELISA of TNF-α levels in the
conditioned h-iPSC-Mg media. TNF-α levels were normalised to the geometric mean of
GAPDH, HPRT1 and RPS18 assessed by RT-qPCR. Note: TNF-α protein was not detectable
in the media of h-iPSC-Mg not treated with IFN-γ. N=5 independent plates. Data shown as
mean ± SEM. Paired Student’s t-test (paired for wells on same plate); * p<0.05. (D) C1QA
expression was increased with OAS1 knockdown. Two-way ANOVA with significant main
effect of only siRNA treatment (p=0.029), not IFN-γ treatment (p>0.05), indicated as a
vertical red line, with no significant interaction (p>0.05). Gene expression levels were
normalised to the geometric mean of GAPDH, HPRT1 and RPS18, then calculated as fold
change relative to the non-targeting siRNA control (vehicle control) without IFN-γ treatment
in each individual culture preparation. N=5 independent plates. Data shown as mean ± SEM.
Two-way ANOVA; significant main effects of IFN-γ treatment and OAS1-knockdown
indicated by red lines. When a significant interaction was seen between IFN-γ treatment and
siRNA treatment, Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests were then performed to test for
pairwise significance of all groups; * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** p<0.001, **** p<0.0001.
