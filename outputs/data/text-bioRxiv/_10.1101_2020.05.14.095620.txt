ABSTRACT
Starting in Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 epidemics quickly propagated worldwide in less than
three months, geographically sorting genomic variants in newly established propagules of
infections. Stochasticity in transmission within and between countries and/or actual advantage
in virus transmissibility could explain the high frequency reached by some genomic variants
during the course of the outbreak.
Using a suite of statistical, population genetics, and theoretical approaches, we show that the
globally most represented spike protein variant (​i.e.​, the G clade, A → G nucleotide change at
genomic position 23,403; D → G amino acid change at spike protein position 614) ​i) underwent
a significant demographic expansion in most countries not explained by stochastic effects or
enhanced pathogenicity; ​ii) affects the spike S1/S2 furin-like site increasing its conformational
plasticity (short range effect), and ​iii) modifies the internal motion of the receptor-binding
domain affecting its cross-connection with other functional domains (long-range effect).
Our study unambiguously links the spread of the G614 with a non-random process, and we
hypothesize that this process is related to the selective advantage produced by a specific
structural modification of the spike protein. We conclude that the different conformation of the
S1/S2 proteolytic site is at the basis of the higher transmission rate of this invasive
SARS-CoV-2 variant, and provide structural information to guide the design of selective and
efficient drugs.

INTRODUCTION
After appearing in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou et al 2020, WHO 2020a), a
highly contagious (Liu et al 2020, D’Arienzo and Coniglio 2020) coronavirus (CoV) causing
severe acute respiratory syndrome COVID-19, spread worldwide and rapidly emerged as a
dramatic pandemic, officially acknowledged on March 11 2020 (WHO 2020a). As of the 12th of
May 2020, about 290,000 deaths related to COVID-19 have been recorded, mainly in the US,
UK, Italy, Spain and France, while the global number of infected people far exceeded four
million (WHO 2020b).
All CoVs encode a spike glycoprotein presented on the surface of the viral particle as
a trimer where each monomer is composed by two subunits (S1 and S2). After cleavage by
host proteases, S1 and S2 subunits remain non-covalently bonded. The S1 subunit contains a
N-terminal domain (NTD), a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that drives host cell tropism and a
C-terminal domain further subdivided in domains SD1 and SD2, while the S2 subunit mainly
consists of heptad repeat (HR) regions involved in membrane fusion (Belouzard et al 2012, Liu
et al 2004, Li 2016; Fig. 1A-B). Spike protein monomers can exist in two main metastable
conformations: down, with the RBD tightly packed against the NTD, and up (Song et al 2018;
Walls et al 2020; Wrapp et al 2020). The up conformation represents the active form of the
spike protein, corresponding to the receptor-accessible configuration (Berry et al 2004, Pak et
al 2009, Walls et al 2017, Wrapp et al 2020). In the cryo-EM structure of the spike protein only
one monomer is found in the up configuration and expected to contact the human
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2; Walls et al 2020, Zhou et al 2020), mediating host
cell invasion.
Coronavirus spike proteins must be primed before they can be triggered to induce
fusion between the viral and the host cellular membranes (Simmons et al 2013, Hoffmann et al
2020a). Priming involves a proteolytic event at a cleavage site (S2’), mediated by the cellular
serine protease TMPRSS2, which converts the protein from a fusion-incompetent to a
fusion-competent state (White & Whittaker 2016). One of the evolutionary innovations in
SARS-CoV-2, which has been suggested to enhance its infectivity (Andersen et al 2020,
Coutard et al 2020), is the presence in the spike of a novel and peculiar furin-like cleavage
site (S1/S2) in the form of an exposed loop harbouring multiple arginine residues (PRRAR/S
amino acid sequence cleaved at the ‘/’ symbol; Walls et al 2020; Wrapp et al 2020; Fig. 1B-C).
This site has been observed, though with different amino acid sequences, in distantly related
CoVs, like MERS-CoV and HKU1-CoV, but not in those viruses that are the most closely
related to SARS-CoV-2 (Coutard et al 2020, Andersen et al 2020, Xiao et al 2020).
The SARS-CoV-2 spike is then activated by a two-step process: a priming cleavage by
furin-like protease at the S1/S2 site and an activating TMPRSS2-mediated cleavage at the S2’
site during membrane fusions (Ou et al 2020, Hoffmann et al 2020b). The S1/S2 cleavage site
is also involved in cell-cell transmission via syncytium formation in SARS-CoV-2 as well as in
MERS-CoV (Qian et al 2013, Ou et al 2020), a more efficient spreading within the host than
cell-free aqueous diffusion (Mothes et al 2010). In laboratory experiments, deletion of the
S1/S2 motif resulted in a spike protein that was no longer able to induce syncytium formation
whereas modification of the S1/S2 motif with a more efficient one (alanine-to-lysine
substitution: RRAR -> RRKR) strongly increased syncytium formation potentially enhancing
pathogenicity (Hoffmann et al 2020b).
A novel spike variant of the spike was discovered in Bavaria, Germany
(EPI_ISL_406862,) and Shanghai, China (EPI_ISL_422425, 416327, 416334) in late January
2020. Only a few weeks later, this variant emerged as the most abundant clade in Europe

(Becerra-Flores and Cardozo 2020, Brufsky 2020, Laha et al 2020, Pachetti et al 2020,
Chiara et al 2020, GISAID’s EpiFlu Database), and in April it was acknowledged as the
prevailing variant worldwide (Korber et al 2020, GISAID’s EpiFlu Database). This SARS-CoV-2
variant is characterized by a nucleotidic transition A → G at the genomic position 23,403,
(Wuhan reference genome; Wu et al 2020), changing an aspartic acid at the spike position
614 into a glycine (hereafter G614, whereas the ancestral state is indicated as D614; reported
in yellow in Fig. 1).
As G614 prevails in every region where it seeded the epidemic and also where it
invaded a region long after the alternative D614, a selective advantage for this novel variant,
and/or its linkage group (Pachetti et al 2020), has been suggested (Korber et al 2020,
Vasilarou et al 2020). However, stochastic processes such as founder effect (​i.e., G614 is
frequent because G614 carriers from a common epidemiological source seeded the epidemic
in different countries) or shared genetic drift (​i.e., ​common random fluctuations in local
populations connected by abundant gene flow) may be responsible for the observed
frequency increase of G614 (Chiara et al 2020). In fact, assessing the adaptive significance of
any genetic change requires a combined approach based on epidemiological data,
population genomics, and a functional explanation of the hypothetical selection advantage.
The molecular bases for the putative G614 selective advantage are not yet
understood. The D → G amino acid substitution may affect the activity of a nearby epitope
potentially involved in antibody-dependent enhancement, as observed in SARS and
MERS-CoV infections (Wang et al 2014, Wan et al 2020). Alternatively, this substitution could
affect the molecular interactions in its proximity, facilitating the separation of S1 from S2 when
the latter is attached to the cell membrane, or have long-range effects on RBD-ACE2 binding
(Korber et al 2020). Detailed analysis of the molecular dynamics of the two alternative spike
variants is therefore crucial to identify the molecular changes which could be responsible for
the rampaging global diffusion of the G614 and plan specific ​in vitro​ and ​in vivo​ assays.
Here, we first demonstrate that the prevalence of the G614 cannot be explained by
shared drift and connectivity among epidemics in different geographic areas. Then, we show
that the mutation of residue 614 has both short- and long-range effects on the dynamics of the
spike protein, affecting both the S1/S2 furin-like cleavage site and the RBD spatial
conformation. In particular, in the G614 variant, the multibasic furin-like domain is much more
exposed than in the D614 variant, and the position of the cleavage residue R685 ​more
strongly stabilized by the electrostatic interaction with D663, likely facilitating the recognition
by the protease. In addition, in the G614 variant, the RBD assumes a more open conformation,
which, we propose, may facilitate the interaction with ACE2. The general similarity of
observed trends in the relative frequencies of the two alternative variants in the genomic
samples and in the actual populations as reconstructed by coalescent-based inference
suggest that the G614 molecular features that we identified are more likely boosting
transmission rate rather than pathogenicity.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Global spread of G614 is not due to random genetic drift
We investigated whether the previously reported frequency increase of the G614 (Korber et al
2020) variant can be attributed to random genetic drift by fitting a generalized mixed model
(GLMM) with binomial error structure.
We modeled the probability that a sampled viral genomic sequence has a G at spike
amino acid position 614 as a function of time, including random intercepts and slopes for
political/administrative units (countries, except for USA States and Chinese provinces,
hereafter "territories") and covariance matrices based on the genetic similarity between viral
samples from each pair of territories. The rationale for this model structure is that territories
serve as reasonable approximations of genetic drift units (demes) and that ​F​ST between two
populations can be seen as the correlation of randomly drawn alleles within each population
​
relative to the total. Hence, we used in the model a correlation matrix based on pairwise ​FST
between populations to account for the shared drift among connected territories. Under these
assumptions, our fixed effect of sampling day represents the change in frequency that is not
explained by genetic drift within territories or is not explained by connectivity among
territories.
Our statistical analysis (considering 5,773 sequences from the 24 territories with at
least 30 sequences each) confirmed that the observed increase in the relative frequency of
the G614 allele is not explained by random drift or connectivity (GLMM: logistic slope per day
= 0.096, SE = 0.017, full/null model ​LR = 22.8, ​df = 1, ​P < 0.001). Similar results are obtained
when ​F​ST ​is calculated only for sequences carrying the G614 allele (GLMM: logistic slope per
day = 0.091, SE = 0.017, full/null model ​LR = 14.0, ​df = 1, ​P < 0.001), in order to account for
events of gene flow which introduce this variant at low frequency in one of the two
populations, or time is aligned around the midpoint of each population, to control for the
correlation between beginning of the epidemics and frequency of G, i.e. the intercept (GLMM:
logistic slope per day = 0.085, SE = 0.017, full/null model ​LR = 13.4, ​df = 1, ​P < 0.001). Note that
the similarity in slope and intercept between population is not correlated with viral population
​ , further suggesting that migration between viral populations
relationships measured as ​FST​
across different territories is not responsible for the widespread increase in the G614 allele
over time (Mantel test ​p​ = 0.96 and ​p​ = 0.70, for intercept and slope, respectively).
By plotting the random effects for each territory (Fig. 2A), we observed that, although
the fitted slope varies among territories, Iceland’s is the only sample to show a decreasing
trend in the relative frequency of the G allele (Fig. 2A) over the sampled time window (March,
1-28 2020). At present, we did not collect data allowing us to test whether this idiosyncratic
trend in Iceland's sample can be attributed to any special feature of this country's epidemic.
However, we note that Iceland has recorded one of the world's lowest fatality rates (ca. 0.5%)
estimated through a detailed tracking of the epidemics (covid.is/english).

non-coding region before the ORF1a and C3037T is a synonymous change within the ORF1a.
On the other hand, C14408T is a non-synonymous change in the ​nsp12 gene coding for the
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and could influence replication efficiency or fidelity
(Pachetti et al 2020). The structural and functional differences between the ancestral and
derived variants of C14408T were not yet thoroughly investigated.
Considering that the genomic samples available through the GISAID EpiFlu Database
are mostly coming from hospitalized patients or from patients showing COVID-19 symptoms,
the apparent selective advantage of the G614 variant could result from more severe COVID-19
outcomes associated to G614 (​i.e.​, increased pathogenicity), which would increase the
prevalence of this variant in the non-random samples of patients seeking treatment. Korber et
al (2020) found no association between G614 and symptom severity in a group of patients
from a single UK hospital. To generalize this result, supporting enhanced transmission rate
over increased pathogenicity in the G614 spread, we used an independent coalescent-based
approach to test for the actual dominance of the G614 in different populations (Australia,
Belgium, England, Iceland, Netherlands, Spain, Wales, USA-WA, USA-NY, and USA-WI).
By comparing the fitted logistic growth of G614 in each territory with the relative
dynamics of the two spike variants in the population as reconstructed by a coalescent-based
demographic inference (Bayesian Skyline plots - BSP; Drummond et al 2005), we observe a
similar trend of the G614 in the genomic samples as well as in the overall population (Fig. 2B)
excluding higher pathogenicity as a potential explanation of the G614 prevalence in the
genomic samples and, instead, further supporting the hypothesis of its higher transmission
rate. Although the pattern is clear in all territories (​i.e., similar general trend in the genomic
sample and in the population), in Iceland and Netherlands, the BSP reconstructions show a
lower prevalence of the G variant in the population than in the hospitalized samples. We note
again that Iceland is the only territory showing a clear decline in the relative frequency of
G614 in the sample, which is also tracked by the BSP, but the case of Netherlands (one of the
countries contributing the most to virus sequencing from the very beginning of the outbreak;
GISAID Database) is more difficult to explain. Even taking into account these differences, we
conclude that increased pathogenicity is an unlikely explanation for the overrepresentation of
G614 in late COVID-19 samples.
G614 enhances virus performance making the furin-like cleavage site more accessible
We investigated the selective advantage of G614 by means of molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations. The time evolution of D614 and G614 variants was followed for 0.5 ​µ​s (for a
total of 1 ​µ​s) to identify the impact of this mutation on the spike structure​. The substitution of
an aspartic acid (D) with a glycine (G) at position 614 modifies the whole fluctuation profile of
the spike trimers (Fig. S2A), in particular in the region downstream of the mutation (residues
622-642): interestingly, in chain A, where the RBD is in the up conformation, this amino acid
substitution increases the fluctuations, while in chains B and C, bearing the RBD in the down
conformations, it has an opposite effect, reducing the fluctuations (Fig. S2B). The altered
profile of the fluctuation extends farther downstream, toward residues 675-692 (Fig. S2B),
comprising the furin-like domain. Of note, the increased mobility of the furin-like domain
appears only in chain A with the activated RBD could have a functional meaning.
The increased flexibility in residues 675-692 makes the furin-like domain more
solvent exposed, with an increase of the accessible surface (SAS) area of ~1.0 ​±0.7 ​nm​2 ​in

G614 as compared to D614 (Fig. 3A) In D614 this domain is tightly bound to the protein
surface, whereas the loop samples a larger conformational space in G614. The loop can
detach from the protein and protrude towards the solvent, thus increasing its accessibility (Fig.
3B). This broader movement can be appreciated by plotting the distance between residue
S680, placed at the tip of the loop and flanking the furin-like domain, and S940, located on
the HR1 domain: this distance significantly increases in the G614 variant reaching a mean
value of 2.1 ±
​ 3 ​nm (Fig. 3C-D).
In addition, as a consequence of this displacement of the loop, R685, the residue of
the furin-like domain directly targeted by the protease is fixed by an electrostatic interaction
formed with D663 (Fig. 3D). This salt bridge is present in the G614 variant and detected for
70% of the time, while it is never observed in the D614 variant (Fig. 3E). Finally, we detect an
increase in the volume of the cavity formed by the multibasic loop and the surrounding
structural elements. At 0.5 ​µ​s of the simulation (i.e. at the end of the simulation) we measured
a volume of 1.46 nm​3 and 1.7 nm​3 for the D614 and G614 variants respectively (Fig. 3F). The
opening of the loop in the furin-like domain, indeed, increases the size of the channel at the
interface with the HR1 domain where the protease can be accommodated.
Taken together, these data indicate that the presence of a glycine in position 614 has
a direct effect on the dynamics of the furin-like domain when the RBD is in the active up
conformation (​i.e., in the active state). The increased mobility of the loop harboring the
multibasic proteolytic site increases the accessibility of the furin-like domain to the solvent
and fixes the position of R686. This likely facilitates the site recognition by the protease and
promotes the subsequent cleavage, leading to an increased rate of spike protein priming. As
the furin-like cleavage site an evolutionary novelty in SARS-CoV-2 as compared to its close
CoVs relative (Andersen et al 2020, Xiao et al 2020), and given its crucial role for efficient
cell-cell transmission (Hoffman et al 2020a and 2020b), our results argue for a refined
efficiency of this infection mechanism in the G614 variant.

The D614G substitution has a long-range effect on the RBD dynamics
To filter out the noise given by minor movements that could hamper the analyses of the main
motions that dictate the large conformational movement of a protein/domain (D’Annessa et al
2018, 2019), we decomposed the whole protein motion in its principal components (PCA) and
discuss the most relevant motions described by the first three eigenvectors. The two variants
of the spike display clear differences in the amplitude of the conformational space sampled by
the RBD in the up conformation along the first three eigenvectors (Fig. 4A and Fig. S3),
together describing more than 50% of the total motion, whereas the essential dynamics is
largely similar between the two variants for the chains with the RBD in down conformation
(data not shown). In general, the motion of the whole S1 subdomain, including the RBD, is
more spread in D614, while the same region in G614 has a more confined motion. However,
the receptor-binding motif (RBM residues 435-506), the apical region of the RBD directly
deputed to bind the ACE2 receptor, shows a larger movement, also allowing it to move far
apart from the NTD, as evidenced by the increase in the distance between these two domains
in G614 (Fig. 4B). Conversely, even if the NTD and RBD in D614 appear to sample a larger
space, their relative position is fixed along the simulation (Fig. 4B).
The differences in the inter-domains coordination can be better highlighted by plotting
the matrix reporting the distance fluctuation (DF) between pairs or residues (Fig. 4C). In this
way we can filter out the regions that are connected dynamically and functionally by following
the variation in the relative distance among selected residues (Morra et al 2012, D’Annessa et
al 2019). Basically, a variation in the pairs distance is an index of low dynamical connection
between the two residues in the pair. In D614 the dynamical connection between the NTD
and the RBD is low (Fig. 4C, left panel, red rectangle), as well as that between the RBD and
the S2 domain (Fig. 4C, left panel, green rectangle). On the contrary, the NTD-RBD connection
becomes stronger in the G614 variant, once again evidencing that the two domains are
dynamically and functionally more connected (Fig. 4C, right panel, red rectangle). In this case,
a very strong connection also appears between the RBD and the S2 domain (Fig. 4C, right
panel, green rectangle), highlighting a stronger functional inter-domains connection in the
G614 variant. Interestingly, in G614 residues 675-692 are poorly connected with the rest of the
protein, when compared to D614 (Fig. 4C, yellow rectangles), once again confirming the
peculiar motion of the furin-like domain in the G614 variant.
The dynamics of the RBD domain is therefore different in the two 614 variants, with the
domain in G614 exploring a more open conformation, suggesting a long range effect of the D
to G substitution that likely increases the efficient interaction of RBD with the ACE2 receptor.
This is in line with the recent cryo-EM structure of the cognate SARS-Cov spike protein bound
to ACE2 provided by Song et al. (Song et al. 2018) where the ACE2-bound RBD is shown as
more open when compared to the ACE2-free RBD in the up conformation. This increased
opening of the RBD domain with respect to the vertical axis of the trimer is a prerequisite for
allowing the proper interaction with the receptor and for further transition from pre- to
post-fusion conformation.

CONCLUSIONS
The G614 spike variant rose to high frequency in the genomic samples from the vast majority
of countries in the world (Korber et al 2020). By statistically controlling for random genetic
drift within geographical areas and for migration among different areas, we confirmed that
the available data are compatible with a selective advantage of G614. Moreover, the
increasing frequencies in the genomic samples are mirrored by similar trends in the actual
virus populations reconstructed by a coalescent-based approach, which argues against a
sampling bias in favor of G614 due to enhanced severity of the COVID-19 symptoms.
The structural analysis of the spike protein revealed the crucial role of position 614 in
interacting with both the S1/S2 furin-like and the receptor-binding domain. The substitution in
this position of an aspartic acid (D), carrying a negatively charged side chain, with a glycine (G)
strongly affects the dynamics of the spike functional domains at a short- and long-range,
making it sample novel structural conformations, responsible for the higher fitness of this
SARS-Cov-2 variant. In particular, the long-range effect of the D614G substitution influences
the internal dynamics of the RBD and its relative orientation, allowing it to acquire a more
open conformation which is particularly suitable for the interaction with the host ACE2

receptor. Nevertheless, the stronger dynamical connection of the RBD with the S2 domain
could allow to remove the steric restraints on helix linker 2, which would better trigger the
release of the S1 subunits, allowing the extension of pre-fusion S2 helixes to form the
postfusion S2 long helix bundle (Song et al 2018).
Finally, compared with the ancestral form D614, the G614 variant shows a marked
conformational plasticity of the furin-like domain, also increasing the volume of the cavity
surrounding the cleavage site. These two structural and dynamical features possibly favor the
furin-like domain recognition by the protease and improve the efficiency of the proteolytic
cleavage, a crucial step for host cell infection. However, what seems to be the evolutionary
strength of the virus in terms of invasiveness can be transformed in its weakness, in the fight
against COVID-19. Indeed, the peculiar properties of the furin-like domain, as the widening of
the cavity, can be exploited to trigger the rational design of drug molecules able to bind it and
compete for the interaction of the spike with the protease, thus specifically blocking the
invasiveness of this highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 variant.
Methods
Models of temporal variation of G614 in the genomic samples.
We tested whether the frequency increase of the G614 spike protein variant can be attributed
to random genetic drift by fitting a generalized mixed model (GLMM) with binomial error
structure. The allele at genomic position 23,403 (G/A), corresponding to amino acid
substitution D → G in residue 614 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, was the binomial
response. The fixed effect was the sampling day. We included random intercepts and slopes
for “territories” (countries, except for USA states and Chinese provinces) and a covariance
​ values between viral samples from each pair of territories. Our
structure represented by ​FST
model structure assumes that random slopes of sampling day within “territories” captures the
random component of allele frequency change (drift) within each territory and that ​F​ST values
capture the relative amount of drift that is shared between pairs of territories (due to
migration, ​i.e. exchange of viral lineages). We fitted the GLMM using the function ​fitme ​from
R package "spaMM" v3.2.0 (Rousset & Ferdy, 2014) on data from territories with at least 30
sequences (​N territories = 24, ​N sequences = 5,773). ​F​ST values were calculated using the
function ​pairwise.fst (​R package “hierfstat” v0.04-22, Goudet, 2005) and including all
sequences available for each territory. Note that the latter choice is conservative, as a
common increase in G614 or D614 variants due to selection in two populations would also
result in a lower distance between them compared to others.
Coalescent-based inference of A/G614 variants diffusion in the population.
Complete high-coverage whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from European, US,
Australian and Chinese isolates were downloaded from the GISAID EpiFlu™ Database on 24
Apr and 6 May 2020. A total of 6,655 sequences were aligned to the Wuhan-Hu-1
SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence (MN908947.3; Wu et al 2020) using mafft (Katoh and Toh
2008). Alignment was checked by eye in Aliview (Larsson 2014) to remove indels, and then
parsed using a custom ​python script to trim sequences before position 150 and after position
29150, and discard sequences with more than 500 missing bases.
Sequences were grouped according to the nucleotidic allele at position 23,403
(whether A or G, corresponding to the D614 and G614 variants, respectively) and then by
territory, resulting in two alignments per territory. Only pairs of alignments with at least 30
sequences for each of the two alleles were retained for downstream analyses (Australia,

Belgium, England, Iceland, Netherlands, Spain, USA-NY, USA-WA, USA-WI, and Wales). The
maximum number of sequences to be used in the coalescent-based analysis was limited to
250, which were randomly selected when needed. Three independent replicates of randomly
selectected sequences were run and checked for consistency of the results.
The demographic history of the D/G614 SARS-CoV-2 variants in each territory was
reconstructed using the Bayesian Skyline plot analyses as implemented in Beast v2.6
(Bouckaert et al 2019). For each alignment we prepared the input file by setting the tips dates
as days before the most recent sequence (available as “Collection date” in the GISAID
metadata), a HKY substitution model, a strict clock model, a coalescent Bayesian Skyline as
tree model and 100,000,000 iterations for the MCMC chain. We ran three replicates for each
alignment and checked their convergence in Tracer 1.8 (Rambaut et al 2018). Bayesian Skyline
plot analyses (Drummond et al 2005) were run in Tracer and results exported as tabular
values. We then calculated the relative frequency through time of the G614 variant in the
population by dividing the median values of the estimated effective population size of the
G614 by the sum of the median values of the estimated effective population sizes of A and
G614 (​Ne​​ (A) and ​N​e​(G), respectively). The confidence intervals of the estimated relative
frequency of the G614 were calculated as follows: for the upper boundary = 97.5% ​N​e​(G) /
(97.5% ​N​e​(G) + 2.5% ​N​e​(A)); lower boundary = 2.5% ​N​e​(G) / (2.5% ​Ne​​ (G) + 97.5% ​N​e​(A)). Plots
were drawn in ​R​ and ​python​ using standard plotting functions and libraries.
Molecular Dynamics Simulations of D614 and G614 variants
The starting structure of the Spike trimeric complex with one RBD in up and two in down
conformation was taken from the structure deposited in the protein data bank with code
6VSB (Wrapp et al 2020). Missing residues, mainly belonging to loops regions, were
reconstructed using the SwissModel web server (​https://swissmodel.expasy.org/​). Because of
the lack of a reliable template to model the 3D arrangement of the HR2 segment with respect
to the rest of the protein, and thus to model the transmembrane region, the model covers
residue 27-1146. All the N-acetylGlucosamine residues present in the cryo EM structure bound
to asparagines residues were retained in the system. The D to G mutation in position 614 was
introduced with the Chimera program (Pettersen et al 2004) and the structure obtained was
further minimized. Topologies of the two systems were built using tleap with the AMBER14
force field (Case at al 2014). Each protein was then placed in a triclinic simulative box filled
with TIP3P water molecules (Jorgensen et al 1983). Addition of sodium counterions rendered
the systems electroneutral; each system consisted of ~555.000 atoms.
The simulations were carried out with amber14 using pmemd.CUDA (Case et al 2014).
The systems were first minimized with 10000 steps of steepest descent followed by 10000
steps of conjugate gradient. Relaxation of water molecules and thermalization of the system
in NPT environment were run for 1.2 ns at 1 fs time-step. In detail, 6 runs of 200 ps each were
carried out by increasing the temperature of 50 K at each step, starting from 50 K to 300 K.
The systems were then simulated with a 2 fs time-step for 500ns each in periodic boundary
conditions, using a cut-off of 8 Å for the evaluation of short-range non-bonded interactions
and the Particle Mesh Ewald method (Cheatham et al 1995) for the long-range electrostatic
interactions. The temperature was kept constant at 300 K with Langevin dynamics (Ceriotti et
al 2009) and pressure fixed at 1 Atmosphere through the Langevin piston method (Feler et al
1995). The bond lengths of solute and water molecules were restrained with the SHAKE
Ryckaert et al 1977) and SETTLE algorithms (Miyamoto and Kollman 1992), respectively. As
stated before, the transmembrane region is lacking. In order to mimic the binding of the spike
trimer on the viral membrane, we applied a force of 1000 kj on the last four residues

(1143-1146) to anchor the protein. Analyses were carried out using Gromacs 5 package (Hess
et al 2008) or with VMD (Humphrey et al 1996) and custom code.
As reported in supplementary figure S2 (panels C and D), both proteins largely deviate
from their starting conformation, reaching a Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) value of ​~0.4
nm​. This was however expected and due to the fact that the starting configuration used to
carry out the simulations comes from cryoEM and was solved at a resolution of 3.46 Å. It is
then reasonable that once hydrated, the proteins undergo sudden conformational changes to
relax the structure. However, the RMSD in both cases reaches a plateau at around 0.15 ​µ​s,
meaning that the two proteins find the stability, and for this reason all analyses reported here
have been performed on the last 0.35 ​µ​s of simulative time.
Volumes were computed using POVME (Wagner et al 2017​)​. An inclusion sphere with
a radius of 11 Å was manually placed between the furinic loop and the near S2 domain after
careful optimization in VMD (Humphrey et al 1996).
Principal component analysis (PCA) for the bound and unbound trajectories was
carried out on the 3N×3N Cartesian displacement matrix whose elements are calculated as:
C​ij​ = 〈r​i​2​q​i​q​j​〉
N being the number of Cα atoms and q​i the (mass-weighted) displacement of the i-th Cα
atoms from the reference value (after removal of rotational and translational degrees of
freedom).
The matrix of the distance fluctuations DF was computed as​:
DF​ij​ = 〈(d​ij​ - 〈d​ij​〉)​2 ​〉
being ​d​ij the (time-dependent) distance of the ​Cα atoms between amino acids ​i and ​j and 〈 〉
the time-average over the trajectory. DF is independent upon translations and rotations of the
molecules and thus on the choice of a protein reference structure.

Figure S3. Essential Dynamics. ​Cumulative percentage of the weight of the single
eigenvectors on the total motion of chain A in D614 ​A and G614 ​B​. For the sake of clarity, both
plots report only the cumulative sum of the first 30 eigenvectors. The lower panels show the
projection of the motion along the second and third eigenvector for D614 (A) and G614 (B).
The grey box highlights the first three eigenvectors that together describe more than 50% of
total motion in both chains A and for this reason have been considered for discussion.
