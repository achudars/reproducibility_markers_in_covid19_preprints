Abstract
We recently discovered a superantigen-like motif, similar to Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB),
near the S1/S2 cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, which might explain the
multisystem-inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) observed in children and cytokine storm in severe
COVID-19 patients. We show here that an anti-SEB monoclonal antibody (mAb), 6D3, can bind
this viral motif, and in particular its PRRA insert, to inhibit infection by blocking the access of
host cell proteases, TMPRSS2 or furin, to the cleavage site. The high affinity of 6D3 for the
furin-cleavage site originates from a poly-acidic segment at its heavy chain CDR2, a feature
shared with SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing mAb 4A8. The affinity of 6D3 and 4A8 for this site points
to their potential utility as therapeutics for treating COVID-19, MIS-C, or common cold caused
by human coronaviruses (HCoVs) that possess a furin-like cleavage site.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause severe interstitial
pneumonia with hyperinflammation1,2, as well as many extrapulmonary manifestations3.
Furthermore, a novel multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS), reported in both children (MISC) and adults (MIS-A), has been observed in patients that either tested positive for, or had

and

hyperinflammation with multi-organ system involvement4-7. The clinical similarity between MISC or severe COVID-19 and the toxic shock syndrome (TSS) caused by bacterial superantigens
(SAg) led to the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 might possess a SAg-like motif that acts acutely
or via an autoimmune-like mechanism to trigger hyperinflammation8,9. Comparison with bacterial
toxins revealed a motif in the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein whose sequence and structure are
highly similar to a segment of a bacterial SAg, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). T cell
receptor (TCR) skewing observed in severe COVID-19 patients further supported the SAg-like
character of the S protein8.

The position of this putative SAg-like motif on the SARS-CoV-2 S structure is worthy of
attention. SARS-CoV-2 S is a homotrimer, belonging to the family of human coronaviruses
(HCoVs). This family includes SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), as
well as the common cold HCoVs, NL63, 229E, OC43 and HKU1, that cause mild to moderate
upper respiratory diseases10-12. Each HCoV-2 protomer is composed of two subunits, S1 and
S2, playing different roles in viral infection. S1 contains the receptor-binding domain that binds
to the receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and
HCoV-NL63) on the host cell13-19; S2 contains the fusion peptide required for viral entry10-12. The
SAg-like motif lies at the C-terminus of S1 (residues E661-R685)8, at the boundary with S2.
Membrane fusion requires two successive cleavages by host cell proteases, one at the S1/S2
interface (peptide bond R685-S686), and the other at S2’ (R815-S816)10,13-18. Thus, the SAg-like
region overlaps with the S1/S2 cleavage site on the surface of the S glycoprotein (Fig 1a-b).

Another even more interesting feature near the S1/S2 cleavage site is the existence of a unique
insertion,

681PRRA684

(shortly PRRA) also taking part in the SAg-like motif and immediately

neighboring the cleavage site R685-S686 (Fig 1a). SARS-CoV-2 is the only βCoV that has
such an insertion, despite its high sequence similarity with other members of this genus (e.g. >
80% with SARS-CoV) (Fig 1b). Interestingly, MERS and common cold HCoVs HKU1 and OC43
S proteins also have a similar insertion at that position, despite their low (30-40%) overall
sequence identity (Fig 1b). The PRRA insert is highly flexible, and together with the adjacent

arginine,

681PRRAR685

forms a highly reactive site. The insert is known to play a role in

recognizing and binding the host cell proteases transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2)
and furin, whose cleavage activity is essential to S protein priming14-17. More recent studies
further showed its role in facilitating SARS-CoV-2 entry and potentiating infectivity upon binding
to the host cell co-receptor neuropilin-129,30; and our simulations also pointed to its propensity to
bind host cell TCRs8.

We hypothesized that such a polybasic site,

681PRRAR685,

implicated in key interactions with

host cell proteins, could serve as a target for SARS-CoV-2 S-neutralizing antibodies (Abs).
Most, if not all, SARS-CoV-2 S Abs currently under investigation are designed/developed to
target the RBD (and some, the N-terminal domain, NTD)24,26,27,31-34. Fig. 1c illustrates the Sprotein epitopes (colored surfaces) that have been observed by cryo-EM to bind mAbs and
ACE2 molecules. These studies show that the Abs used as immunogens exhibit distinctive
binding poses/sites favored by up (open) or down (closed) states of the RBDs (see Table 1).
However, it is important to note that these cryo-EM studies were conducted in the presence of
amino acid substitutions at the polybasic segment 682RRAR685. The ability, if any, of the wild type
(wt) S protein to bind an Ab near the PRRA insert or the S1/S2 cleavage may thus have eluded
these experiments.
We focus here on this polybasic site unique to SARS-CoV-2 among SARS-family βCoVs, as a
target for mAb binding. In view of the recently detected sequence- and structure-similarity
between the PRRA-insert-enclosing SAg-like motif and the bacterial enterotoxin SEB, we
hypothesize that previously generated anti-SEB monoclonal Abs (mAbs) may potentially bind
the viral SAg-like motif, and in particular the segment 682RRAR685, and may thus block access to
the S1/S2 cleavage site. We therefore examined in silico the possible interactions of known antiSEB mAbs35 with SARS-CoV-2 S. Our study revealed the high affinity of SEB-specific mAb 6D3
for binding to the S1/S2 site. We also generated structural models for the interaction of the Sprotein with TMPRSS2 and furin to demonstrate that the 6D3 binding site overlaps with those of
these proteases, suggesting that 6D3 might interfere with viral entry. Experiments conducted
with live viruses showed that 6D3 indeed inhibited viral entry to the host cell. Given that this site
does not overlap with those observed to bind Abs (Fig. 1c), our study suggests that 6D3 might
be used in combination with other neutralizing Abs that target the RBD or other non-overlapping
sites to increase the efficacy of mAbs in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry.

Furthermore, we performed an in silico screening of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAbs (Table 1),
to probe their ability to bind near the PRRA insert, or the furin-like cleavage site. The latter

revealed that 4A826 may also bind the same site and as a result obstruct the S1/S2 site.
Therefore, 4A8 and 6D3 may potentially serve as scaffold for designing wide-spectrum Abs for
reducing the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and even other HCoVs that harbor a furin-like cleavage
site (see Fig. 1b).

Results
TMPRSS2 and/or furin-bound to the S1/S2 site in close association with the PRRA insert

Host cell proteases cleave SARS-CoV-2 S at the S1/S2 site and induce a conformational
change required for S protein priming for cell fusion and viral entry14-18. To assess whether Abs
that might target the PRRA site would also hinder the access of proteases to the S1/S2 site, we
first examined in silico the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the proteases
TMPRSS2 and furin. The resulting structural models are presented in the respective panels a
and b of Fig. 2, and more details are reported in the Extended Data Figs 1 and 2. We used the
available structural data14,15,37 for the three proteins, and the protein-protein docking software
ClusPro38 and protocols outlined in the Supplemental Methods. An ensemble of structural
models were generated for each complex, and those conformers satisfying the criteria for
potential cleavage at the S1/S2 site, mainly close-positioning (within 3-7 Å atom-atom distance)
of catalytic residues near the S1/S2 site, were selected for further refinement and energetic
evaluation using PRODIGY39.

TMPRSS2 catalytic residues (H296, D345 and S441) were observed to bind near the S1/S2
cleavage region

of SARS-CoV-2 S in 7.5% of the generated models (Extended

Data Fig. 1b). The corresponding binding affinities were calculated to vary from -14.1 to -11.3
kcal/mol with an average of -12.7 ± 2.0 kcal/mol. Fig. 2a displays the most energeticallyfavorable model where the three arginines in 681PRRARS686 penetrate in the TMPRSS2 catalytic
cavity (Fig. 2a, right). Three arginines make salt bridges with acid residues (enclosed in
ellipses): R682 forms one with TMPRSS2 residue D435, R683 inserts into a pocket containing

the TMPRSS2 catalytic aspartate D345, and cleavage site arginine R685 with E299, positioning
the scissile bond (spheres) near TMPRSS2 catalytic residues S441 and H296.

In the case of furin binding, in contrast to TMPRSS2, 70% of the generated structural models
showed the catalytic residues (D153, H194 and S368) stabilized in close proximity of the S1/S2
cleavage region 681PRRARS686 (see Extended Data Fig. 2), indicating that binding of furin to the
cleavage site was entropically more favorable than that of TMPRSS2. The corresponding
binding affinities varied from -16.4 to -11.8 kcal/mol with an average of -14.1±2.3 kcal/mol. The
best pose with the catalytic residues facing the S1/S2 site is shown in Fig. 2b (and Extended
Data Fig. 2a), and reveals a number of tight interactions, mostly with S1/S2 loop residues R682
and R683 inserting into negatively charged pockets of furin to enable the cleavage of the SARSCoV-2 S.

Overall, our analysis shows that either TMPRSS2 or furin can bind the S1/S2 cleavage site and
engage in tight intermolecular interactions, in which the basic residues R682 and R683 on the
PRRA insert reach out to the catalytic residues of either protease. Binding of either enzyme is
accommodated by changes in the local conformations near the cleavage region. However, in
silico models also suggest that furin binds to the S protein S1/S2 site with higher potency and
probability, favored both enthalpically and entropically, compared to TMPRSS2.

In silico screening identifies 4A8 as a potential antibody blocking the S1/S2 cleavage site
SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein is the major target of neutralizing mAbs24,26,27,31-34. As listed in
Table 1, cryo-EM studies of antibody-, nanobody- or Fab-bound SARS-CoV-2 S, have been
carried out upon substituting the polybasic segment

by GSAS or SGAG

for

practical purposes. These mutations would not affect the binding of the Abs that target the RBD
(or NTD); but would affect the binding, if any, to the S1/S2 site, as the mutant S lacks the unique
character of the highly reactive polybasic segment

682RRAR685.

We hypothesized that in silico

analyses conducted for the wt S protein might capture features that could have been overlooked
in the studies carried out with mutants. Therefore, we generated structural models for the intact
S as well as its GSAS-mutant using SWISS-MODEL20 based on the cryo-EM structures of the
dominant conformational states (PDB: 6VSB15 and 6VXX14); and we tested in silico the binding
properties of the mAbs listed in Table 1 to both structures using ClusPro38, to examine the
possible binding of the Abs near the S1/S2 cleavage site.

Simulations conducted for the GSAS-substituted mutants showed that, not surprisingly, none of
the mAbs listed in Table 1 bound with high affinity to the S1/S2 region, consistent with cryo-EM
studies. Multiple binding sites were observed within the RBD and NTD of S1, as well as subunit
S2, pointing to possible alternative binding regions, but the vicinity of the mutation site did not
attract the mAbs. In contrast, simulations repeated with the wt S protein showed that

682RRAR685

would bind with high affinity the SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing mAb 4A8, and potentially block the
S1/S2 cleavage site. 4A8 was identified by cryo-EM to bind to the NTD of the S protein26, near
residues H145-S150 and G245-R256 (Fig. 3a). Notably, our docking simulations also showed
that the S epitope and 4A8 paratope observed in cryo-EM indeed engaged in tight interactions
(Fig. 3b). However, the SAg-like motif E661-R685 also emerged as another equally favorable
site in our simulations (Fig. 3c). Remarkably, a close overlap between the site occupied by 4A8
and the (otherwise) binding pose of TMPRSS2 or furin was noted, as illustrated for TMPRSS2 in
Fig. 3d, suggesting that 4A8 might compete with the proteases for binding this site.

To better assess the ability of 4A8 to possibly compete with host cell proteases to bind the
S1/S2 site, we evaluated the binding affinity of 4A8 to the S protein in comparison to those of
TMPRSS2 and furin. The calculated affinity of 4A8 to bind the S1/S2 site varied from -15.8 to 11.0 kcal/mol with an average of -13.4±2.4 kcal/mol; and its affinity to the NTD site identified by
cryo-EM (PDB: 7C2L) varied from -13.8 to -11.2 kcal/mol with an average of -12.5±1.3 kcal/mol.
Notably, the affinity of 4A8 to bind the S1/S2 cleavage site is comparable to that of TMPRSS2,
and slightly weaker than that of furin. Interestingly, the equilibrium dissociation constants
(Kd) measured by biolayer interferometry for the complexes that 4A8 formed with S and with
subunit S1 were less than 2.14 nM, and 92.7 nM, respectively26. The binding energies (ΔG)
based on these respective Kd values would be -12.3 and -9.6 kcal/mol at 298 K. The computed
binding energies show therefore good agreement with the measured Kd for the S protein-4A8
complex. It is interesting to note that binding to S1 was less favorable than that to S protein26.
This could be attributed to an increased disorder at the “PRRAR” region in the absence of the
scaffold provided by the intact S protein, as well as the lack of the contribution of adjoining S2
residues (e.g. S686) to intermolecular association.

Previous studies demonstrated that the mAb 4A8 has strong neutralizing capacities against both
authentic and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-226. While we do not exclude the existence of
neutralizing effects due to its binding to the NTD site observed in cryo-EM (PDB:7C2L)26, our

findings suggest that interfering with the access of proteases to the cleavage site S1/S2 could
also contribute to its neutralizing effects. Furthermore, the comparable binding affinities of
TMPRSS2 and 4A8 mAb competing for the S1/S2 site suggest that mAb blocking of the
cleavage site is possible with a sufficiently high-affinity mAb. We next proceed to the
identification of more specific, high affinity mAbs that bind the 681PRRARS686 motif.
Anti-SEB antibody 6D3 is distinguished by its high affinity to bind SARS-CoV-2 S SAglike region

Because the S residues E661-R685 that enclose the polybasic segment

681PRRAR685

are

sequentially and structurally similar to the segment T150-D161 of SEB , we examined if mAbs
specific to SEB35, could be used for neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 S protein as well. The close
proximity of the viral SAg-like region to the S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site (685R-S686 peptide
bond), suggests that an anti-SEB mAb that cross-reacts with SARS-CoV-2 would have the
added potential to block the cleavage site essential to viral entry, apart from its potential
modulation of SAg-mediated hyperinflammatory cytokine storm41.

Three SEB-associated mAbs, 14G8, 6D3, and 20B1, have been generated as effective blockers
of the SAg activity of SEB in an animal model of TSS35. Examination of the corresponding
crystal structures shows that these antibodies bind different sites on SEB35, as illustrated in Fig.
4a. Notably, only 6D3 targets the SEB polybasic segment T150-D161 that is sequentially and
structurally similar to the SARS-CoV-2 S SAg-like motif. A closeup view shows the tight
interaction between the acidic residues E50, D52 and D55 of mAb 6D3 heavy chain and four
basic residues of SEB (Fig. 4b).

As expected, docking simulations with S protein and these anti-SEB mAbs also showed that
only 6D3 was able to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 S SAg motif (Fig. 4c-e), consistent with 6D3
binding to the precise SEB fragment that aligns with the spike SAg-like motif. Our computational
analysis further predicted the 6D3 Ab to have a greater affinity for binding this polybasic region
compared to TMPRSS2, and an affinity comparable to that of furin. The 6D3 binding affinity was
-14.2 ± 2.3 kcal/mol based on a cluster of conformers that exhibited similar binding features
(see Supplemental Methods). Notably, acidic residues E50, D52 and D55 from the heavy chain
of 6D3 were again found to interact with polybasic insert PRRA in SARS-CoV-2 S, with R682
and R683 playing a central role as will be elaborated below; but interfacial contacts were quite

distributed, involving other SARS-CoV-2 S amino acids such as E654, N603 and N679
interacting with either the heavy or light chains of 6D3 (Fig. 4e). Among those 6D3-interacting
S residues, N603 has been identified as an N-linked glycan site by site-specific glycan analysis
of SARS-CoV-2 S42. To further investigate if glycan sequons may interfere with Ab 6D3 binding,
we aligned our spike-6D3 complex model against the glycosylated spike43; no steric overlap was
observed between Ab 6D3 and glycan sequons. The N603-linked glycan might even be involved
in the recognition by 6D3 rather than obstructing its binding.

Based on these results, we proposed that 6D3 may have the capacity to attenuate, if not
completely block, SARS-CoV-2 infection upon effectively competing with the host cell proteases
TMPRSS2 and furin to bind to the cleavage site, and thus prevent the proteolytic cleavage of
the S protein monomers that is essential to S protein priming for viral entry.

Anti-SEB antibody, 6D3, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection

Our in silico analyses led to the identification of two mAbs (4A8 and 6D3) that may potentially
block SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 cleavage site. 4A8 has been demonstrated in previous work to
possess strong neutralizing capacities against both authentic and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-226.
We investigated here whether the anti-SEB antibody 6D3 also had a similar capacity. To this
end, we tested the ability of 6D3 to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in an in vitro cell culture
infection system. Antibodies were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour and then added to
plated Vero-E6 cells. At 48 hours post infection, we analyzed viral infection by
immunofluorescence using antibodies against dsRNA or SARS-CoV-2 S protein. (Fig. 5 and
Extended Data Fig. 3). We found that 6D3 significantly inhibited viral infection, as measured by
the percentage of dsRNA positive cells, at concentrations of 0.8, 4 and 20 μg/ml of antibody
(Fig. 5a-b and Extended Data Fig. 3a). Furthermore, in an independent set of experiments, we
found that 6D3 significantly inhibited viral infection, as measured by the percentage of spike
positive cells, at concentrations of 4, 20 and 40 μg/ml of antibody, while there was a trend for
inhibition at 0.16 and 0.8 μg/ml of antibody (Fig. 5c-d and Extended Data Fig. 3b).
Combined with in silico modeling, these results indicate that 6D3 can block the protease
cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 Spike to prevent viral entry in a concentration dependent manner,
and confirm our previous finding that SARS-CoV-2 Spike possesses a SAg-like structure similar
to SEB. 6D3 may therefore have a dual potential to block SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as SAg-

mediated T cell activation and hyperinflammation, with implications for treating cytokine storm
during severe COVID-19 and MIS-C/A diseases.

An acidic residue cluster at VH CDR2 is the hallmark of Abs targeting the furin-like
cleavage site

Our study pointed to the distinctive ability of two mAbs, 6D3 and 4A8, to bind the S1/S2
cleavage site, while other mAbs (in Table 1) did not show such a binding propensity. We
investigated which sequence/structure features distinguish these two mAbs from all others. Abs
target viruses mainly through their three complementarity determining regions (CDR1-3) in the
variable domains, especially those in the heavy chains44. Fig. 6a compares the sequences of
the variable heavy (VH) chains of SARS-CoV-2 S-associated mAbs, as well as those of the
three mAbs associated with SEB. CDR3s exhibit the largest sequence variation, in accord with
their role in conferring specificity. However, comparison of the sequences reveals a unique
feature that distinguishes 6D3 and 4A8, mainly a poly-acidic cluster at their CDR2. Specifically,
the 6D3 CDR2 possesses three acidic residues E50, D52, and D55, already noted above to
enable binding to not only the SAg-like motif of SEB and SARS-CoV-2, but also the precise
cleavage-site on the S protein. Likewise, mAb 4A8 has four acidic residues D52, E54, D55 and
D57, compared to none in the majority of the RBD-targeting mAbs (Fig. 6a).

A poly-acidic CDR2 at the VH chain thus emerges as a hallmark of the mAbs that target the
polybasic furin-like cleavage site. As shown in Fig. 6b and c, these acidic residues facilitate Abspike complexation through salt bridges formed with the basic residues (R682, R683 and R685)
in the

680SPRRARSV687

segment, the central component of a typical furin-cleavage site36, thus

blocking the access of proteases to the S1/S2 cleavage site.

As shown in Fig. 1b, the polybasic insertion of SARS-CoV-2 is not shared by other SARS-family
βCoVs, but is found in common cold HCoVs HKu1 and OC43, and in MERS. Present findings
strongly suggest that mAbs 6D3 and 4A8 may also target these other HCoVs that encode a
furin- cleavage site. To test this hypothesis, we generated a structural model for HCoV-OC43 S
protein based on the cryo-EM structure resolved for OC43 (PDB: 6NZK)45 using SWISSMODEL20. We then investigated the binding properties of the Abs 6D3 and 4A8 to that structure
with docking simulations. The most stable (highest binding affinity) poses resulting from our
simulations are presented in Fig. 6d. Both 6D3 and 4A8 are therefore predicted to bind the

S1/S2 furin cleavage site of HCoV-OC43 S. Again, poly-acidic residues in CDR2 play a primary
role in binding to the cleavage site of HCoV-OC43 S. These findings underscore the potential
effectiveness of Abs that target the S protein S1/S2 cleavage site, and their cross-reactivity
between the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and other selected HCoVs.

Discussion
A new strategy for combatting SARS-CoV-2: repurposing of antibodies that target the
S1/S2 cleavage site

There is an urgent need to design effective therapeutics that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and
suppress the hyperinflammatory cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 and MIS-C/A patients. The
most effective measure against SARS-CoV-2 is vaccination, and multiple SARS-CoV-2
vaccines are about to be released following several successful phase III trials46. However, the
duration of the immune protection, their ability to protect special populations across all age
groups, as well as the capacity to produce sufficient doses of safe and effective vaccines remain
to be determined46, highlighting further the urgent need to discover effective therapeutics.

SARS-CoV-2 S is the main determinant of cell entry and the major target of neutralizing
Abs24,26,27,31-34. Binding to receptor ACE2 is an essential first step in establishing infection;
therefore the majority of COVID-19 Ab therapies under investigation are designed to target the
S protein RBD, while other potential neutralizing epitopes have also been found23,24,26,27,31-34.
Given the high glycosylation and antigenic variability of SARS-CoV-2 S47, a combination of
mAbs that target multiple sites and multiple conformations of SARS-CoV-2 S, is likely the most
effective strategy. Besides blocking ACE2 binding, distinct neutralizing mechanisms have been
proposed, including Ab-dependent cell cytotoxicity and phagocytosis24 and restraining the
conformational changes of SARS-CoV-2 Spike26.

Proteolytic cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 S is the second critical step, succeeding ACE2 binding, in
the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Host proteases shown to prime the SARS-CoV-2 S include cell
surface TMPRSS2, furin, and endosomal cathepsins16,48. TMPRSS2 and furin inhibitors have
been found to block cell entry of SARS-CoV-216,49. Unlike TMPRSS2, furin is a ubiquitous
proprotein convertase and is required for normal development and function50. Thus, repurposing

of Abs that block the S1/S2 cleavage site is an attractive alternative solution that avoids effects
on the (other) biological activities of TMPRSS2 and furin.

It is well known that the SARS-CoV-2 spike is heavily glycosylated, and the possible
interference of glycans with Ab binding is a plausible consideration. Notably, 6D3- or 4A8binding did not give rise to steric clash with the N-linked glycan sequons near the S1/S2 site
(e.g. N603, or N657/N658 as reported42). In addition SARS-CoV-2 S was predicted to be Oglycosylated at S673, T678 and S686 near the S1/S2 cleavage site51, yet to be confirmed by
experiments42,52. Therefore, mAbs may possibly escape the glycan shields and target directly
the S1/S2 site of SARS-CoV-2 S as the host proteases do.

The ability of the polybasic insert to bind antibodies may have escaped prior cryo-EM
studies with mutant S protein

The detailed atomic structure of the S1/S2 cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 S is yet to be
determined. It has been a challenge to resolve this region in cryo-EM studies of HCoV S
proteins. First, pre-activation of HCoV S during protein preparation results in a mixture of
cleaved and un-cleaved spikes53. Second, local conformational changes near the S1/S2 region
may differ between cleaved and intact structures, as observed in influenza viruses54. Third,
multiple conformations, if not a disordered state, may exist near that region, as indicated by
microseconds molecular dynamics simulations and ab initio modeling55. Therefore, it has been
difficult to resolve that region, and the majority of cryo-EM studies of SARS-CoV-2 S protein
complexed with Abs have resorted to mutant S proteins where the

682RRAR685

segment has

been replaced by GSAS or SGAG22-28,40 (Table 1). These ‘mutant spikes’ may have precluded
the discovery of binding of Abs to the S1/S2 site. Molecular modeling and simulations provided
insights into the interactions at this region, including those with proteases and other
receptors8,55,56. We undertook such modeling studies (Figs 2, 3, 4c-e and 6), and performed
live-virus experiments (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 3) to investigate the Abs that possibly
interfere with the binding of host cell proteases TMPRSS2 and furin. To our knowledge, we
identified the first two antibodies (6D3 and 4A8) that may block the S1/S2 cleavage site in
SARS-CoV-2 S protein.

6D3 is a repurposable anti-SEB mAb that targets the S1/S2 site and inhibits viral infection

6D3 is an antibody originally discovered for neutralizing the superantigenic bacterial toxin SEB.
Here we are proposing its use as repurposable antibody against SARS-CoV-2 S protein, by
virtue of its ability to bind a sequence motif shared between SEB and S protein. Our recent
study indeed revealed the high sequential and structural similarity between SARS-CoV-2 S
amino acids E661-R685

and SEB amino acids T150-D161, which may contribute to

hyperinflammation and MIS-C/A pathogenesis through a SAg-induced immune activation8. This
view was supported by the observations that the clinical and laboratory features observed in
MIS-C and severe COVID-19 patients were similar to those of toxic shock syndrome (TSS)
caused by bacterial toxins such as SEB9; and adult patients with severe Covid-19 displayed
TCR skewing typical of SAg-induced immune response8. Therefore, we hypothesized that mAbs
that target the homologous segment of SEB, if any, could be repurposed as SARS-CoV-2 Abs.
Among the three mAbs discovered against SEB35, 6D3 was the only one specific to the region
of interest (Fig. 4a-b), and computations and experiments corroborated our hypothesis that this
anti-SEB mAb could bind the SARS-CoV-2 S protein.

It remains to be seen if 6D3 can effectively interfere with the superantigenic activity of the S
protein and possibly suppress the hyperinflammation and cytokine storm associated with MISC/A. However, one other feature that caught our attention was the fact that this SAg-like
segment (that binds 6D3) also overlapped with the S1/S2 cleavage site, a furin-like cleavage
site characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 (and MERS and HCovs HKU1 and OC43; see Fig. 1b).
Furin-cleavage sites usually involve ~20 residues, with eight residues in the vicinity of the
cleavage site playing a central role36. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the segment
680SPRRAR↑SV687

forms this central component of the furin cleavage site at the S protein.

Simulations indeed showed strong interactions (salt bridges) formed between 6D3 VH CDR2
(distinguished by a stretch of acidic residues) and the polybasic segment

682RRAR685

of the S

protein (Figs 4c-e and 6b), and in vitro assays confirmed that 6D3 inhibited viral entry (Fig. 5
and Extended Data Fig. 3).
Notably, 4A8, previously shown to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection26, also possesses the same
polyacidic properties at its VH CDR2 (Fig. 6a and c), which distinguishes 6D3 and 4A8 from all
other SARS-CoV-2-S-associated mAbs. These results suggest that the effectiveness of 4A8

may have originated from its high affinity to bind the polybasic insert at the furin-like cleavage
site (alongside possible binding to NTD observed in cryo-EM26). Structural characterization of
the wt S protein complexed with 4A8 could shed light onto this possibility.

mAbs containing a cluster of acidic residues at their VH CDR2 may mitigate viral
infections caused by CoVs that contain furin-like cleavage sites

HCoVs include three highly pathogenic viruses, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS, and four
circulating endemic viruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HKU1) which cause
mild to moderate upper respiratory diseases10-12. Interestingly, many individuals who have not
been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 possess SARS-CoV-2 Spike reactive T cells, due to crossreaction of immune responses generated against other HCoV strains57,58. Cross-reactive
antibodies between human βCoV strains have also been identified, including those between
SARS and SARS-CoV-259,60. Indeed, SARS monoclonal antibody S309 can potently neutralize
both SARS and SARS-CoV-224. Furthermore, the effectiveness of IVIG4-6, may, in part, be due
to the presence of cross-reactive antibodies against other HCoV stains. These findings raise the
exciting possibility of designing wide spectrum Abs with cross-reactivity among HCoVs. The
two Abs (6D3 and 4A8) identified in this study to bind the PRRAR insert and cleavage site may
potentially act as wide spectrum Abs to block S1/S2 cleavage site in HCoVs that encode furinlike cleavage sites (Fig. 6), providing benefit beyond the current pandemic. Previous work also
showed the role of CDR2-binding in neutralizing a toxin61. The hallmark poly-acidic residues in
the CDR2 of VH may be exploited as a benchmark to sort out mAbs able to target the SARSCoV-2 furin cleavage site.

Alternative strategies targeting the S1/S2 site in the light of these repurposable mAbs

Based on the scaffold of 6D3 or 4A8 heavy chain, mini-proteins may be designed to target
SARS-CoV-2, MERS, HCoV-OC43 or HKU1, to block CoV entry. Notably, designed de novo
mini-proteins have been shown to block ACE2 binding, based on the scaffold of ACE262. Very
recently, neuropilin-1 (NRP1) has been identified as a host factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection,
bound to the

681RRAR685

segment30. Remarkably, blockade of this interaction by RNAi or mAb

against NRP1 significantly reduced in vitro SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry29,30. We anticipate that
6D3 or 4A8 can effectively block the binding of NRP1. At present, no clinical treatments or
prevention strategies are available for HCoVs12. Our work may lead to an improved

understanding of coronavirus immunity, facilitating future studies to understand mechanisms of
antibody recognition and neutralization, and help screen SARS-CoV-2 Abs for treatment of
COVID-19. These findings also raise exciting possibilities of designing novel therapeutic
approaches using a combination treatment of Abs 6D3 or 4A8 to treat severe COVID-19 and
MIS-C/A patients. Likewise, cocktail treatment including furin-like cleavage site-targeting Abs
with RBD-targeting neutralization Abs may provide complementary protection against SARSCoV-2 pathogenesis.
