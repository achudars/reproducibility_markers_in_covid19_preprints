Abstract
An initial outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China has resulted
in a massive global pandemic causing well over 16,500,000 cases and 650,000 deaths
worldwide. The virus responsible, SARS-CoV-2, has been found to possess a very close
association with Bat-CoV RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoV MP789. The nucleocapsid protein can
serve as a decent model for determining phylogenetic, evolutionary, and structural relationships
between coronaviruses. Therefore, this study uses the nucleocapsid gene and protein to further
investigate the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and closely related bat and pangolin
coronaviruses. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses have revealed the nucleocapsid gene and
protein in SARS-CoV-2 are both closely related to those found in Bat-CoV RaTG13
and Pangolin-CoV MP789. Evidence of recombination was detected within the N gene, along with
the presence of a double amino acid insertion found in the N-terminal region. Homology modeling
for the N-Terminal Domain revealed similar structures but distinct electrostatic surfaces
and topological variations in the β-hairpin that likely reflect specific adaptive functions. In respect
to SARS-CoV-2, two amino acids (S37 and A267) were found to exist only in its N protein, along
with an extended β-hairpin that bends towards the nucleotide binding site. Collectively, this study
strengthens the relationship among SARS-CoV-2, Bat-CoV RaTG13, and Pangolin-CoV MP789,
providing additional insights into the structure and adaptive nature of the nucleocapsid protein
found in these coronaviruses. Furthermore, these data will enhance our understanding of the
complete history behind SARS-CoV-2 and help assist in antiviral and vaccine development.

Introduction
In December 2019, an outbreak of an unknown disease occurred in Wuhan, China.1 Soon
after, this illness was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and defined as a respiratory
infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with patients
displaying symptoms that manifested as mild or severe cases of pneumonia.1,2 Initial cases showed
very close associations with the local animal market in Wuhan, which contained both live
and dead animals, suggesting a spillover event occurred from an unidentified animal source into
the human population.2 Following its emergence in China, SARS-CoV-2 has managed to spread
across six continents and result in over 16,500,000 confirmed cases and 650,000 deaths
worldwide.3 As of now, there is still no available vaccine to combat the disease, and while the
number of cases and deaths continue to grow, there is a huge need to continue research that studies
every aspect of the virus, including its phylogeny and evolution.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are diverse single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses with
genomes ~30 kilobases in length and belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae in the
family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales. Furthermore, there are four recognized and
distinct genera in Coronavirinae: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus,
and Gammacoronavirus.4 Additionally, these four genera then split into a variety of distinct
subgenera (https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/). Officially, SARS-CoV-2 has been ranked
within the genus Betacoronavirus and the subgenus Sarbecovirus, which are the same groups
that contain severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).5 An overall 96%
genome identity revealed the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 was Bat-CoV RaTG13, followed
by an 88% genome identity with bat-SL-CoVC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21.6 In relation
to SARS-CoV, only 79% genome identity was found to indicate a more genetically distant
relationship exists between each virus.6,7 Recently, CoVs that were isolated from pangolins
were found to have a 90-91% genome identity with SARS-CoV-2.8,9 In the spike protein, the
receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 held greater similarity with pangolin CoVs in
six key RBD residues unlike in Bat-CoV RaTG13 which only shares a single residue.10 Therefore,
it has been hypothesized that recombination occurred during the evolution of pangolin CoVs
and Bat-CoV RaTG13, contributing to the development of SARS-CoV-2.8,9,10 Additionally,
these particular CoVs tend to form a separate clade in the Sarbecovirus subgenus when viewed on

either genome-based or gene-based phylogenetic trees, furthering the likelihood of a shared
ancestry that is more distinct from other distantly related CoVs.8,11,12
Although phylogeny for SARS-CoV-2 is largely established, the complete evolutionary
history for the virus is still in question. A recent investigation that focused on the molecular
evolution of SARS-CoV-2 indicated majority of the open-reading frames undergo purifying
selection, and there exists little evidence of positive selection.13 Furthermore, bats are natural
reservoirs that possess a variety of CoVs.14,15 With greatest similarity to Bat-CoV RaTG13 found
in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus affinis), SARS-CoV-2 likely has its origin in bats as well. While
bats serve as the natural reservoir, the identity of an intermediate host is largely unresolved. A
range of conflicting studies have come out to suggest, but not definitely prove, that snakes, turtles,
yaks, and/or Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) could potentially be the intermediate host(s) for
the virus.8,9,16-18 Even if one of these animals is the intermediate host, SARS-CoV-2 has yet to
be isolated from any of them.19 Nonetheless, many CoVs go through an intermediate host prior
to reaching their intended host; therefore, it seems unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 would fail to possess
an intermediate host of some kind.15,19
In the remaining one-third of all CoV genomes, there are several open-reading frames near
the 3’-terminus that encode four main structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M),
envelope (E), and spike (S) proteins.4,20 The N protein is multifunctional and involved in a variety
of processes such as genome encapsidation and circularization, transcription, RNA packaging,
genome transport to viral budding sites, repressing interferon production, cell cycle inhibition, and
blocking RNA interference.20-23 Furthermore, the N protein is also highly immunogenic
and largely overexpressed during replication, thereby capable of inducing large-scale immune
responses against CoVs.24,25 Overall, the N protein possesses two highly conserved domains:
the N-Terminal Domain (NTD) and C-Terminal Domain (CTD).23,26 Between each domain is an
intrinsically disordered but flexible region known as the Linker Region (LKR) that is rich in serine
and arginine residues.26 There are two additional intrinsically disordered regions located at each
terminus: the N-Terminal Region (NTR) and C-Terminal Region (CTR).26 Each disordered region
can interact with either the genome or viral proteins following the phosphorylation of residues that
induce conformational changes to promote high affinity binding.26,27 In particular, the NTD is
divergent in sequence and length; however, it has a β-sheet core along with a highly electropositive

groove and β-hairpin extension that binds RNA to neutralize negative charges found within
the phosphate-sugar backbone.26 For majority of CoVs their NTDs are structurally similar;
nevertheless, multiple electrostatic surface comparisons have revealed uniquely arranged charge
distributions, suggesting that CoV NTDs utilize distinct modes of RNA-binding.26,28 In terms of
function, the NTD serves as scaffolding to assist in genome packaging and virion assembly.28,29
From an evolutionary standpoint, the N gene in SARS-CoV-2 was found to be under strong
selective pressure and displayed higher genetic diversity, increased host adaptation, and was prone
to natural selection.30 The structure of the dimerization domain in the SARS-CoV N protein has
also helped to provide a link between Coronaviridae and Arteriviridae, highlighting the importance
of structural data in assessing the relationship between different viruses.31 Since the N protein is
largely conserved and found to be evolving faster than other CoV proteins, it can serve as a
model for establishing phylogenetic relationships, assessing mutations, calculating divergence
times, and determining if recombination events occurred among specific CoVs.14,30
Currently, there is a limited amount of research focusing exclusively on the N protein
in SARS-CoV-2. Herein, this study relies on a strictly bioinformatic and homology modeling
approach in which both N gene and protein sequences are used to further investigate the
characteristics shared between SARS-CoV-2 and a set of closely related bat and pangolin CoVs.

Materials and Methods
1. Sequence Acquisition and Identity Analysis
Nucleocapsid gene and protein sequences in SARS-CoV-2, pangolin CoVs, and bat CoVs
were retrieved from the NCBI RefSeq, Nucleotide, and Protein databases. Percent identity was
calculated by MatGAT v2.01 to determine the shared identity for each sequence type.32 For
nucleotide identity, the first gap and extending gap penalties were set at 16 and 4, respectively. As
for amino acid identity, a PAM250 scoring matrix was used along with the first gap and extending
gap penalties set at 12 and 2, respectively.
2. Phylogenetic and Recombination Analysis
Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE on the MEGA-X v10.1.7 software.33,34 The
default alignment settings were retained, except clustering methods which were both changed to
neighbor joining. In addition, nucleotide sequences were aligned by codons. An individual gene
tree and protein tree were constructed using different maximum likelihood methods and visualized
on MEGA-X.35 While constructing both trees, uniform rates and partial deletion were used. The
heuristic model was nearest-neighbored-interchange and the initial tree was automatically
made with the default option NJ/BioNJ. These trees were not rooted with an outgroup.
Based on the protein tree, one sequence was chosen from each split. Using those sequences,
nucleotide and amino acid identities for the NTD and CTD were calculated by MatGAT v2.01 to
evaluate the identity shared among each domain. Individual gene and protein trees were also
constructed for each domain in the same manner as previously described. Gene sequences were
aligned using MUSCLE, after which the alignment was used by SimPlot v3.5.1 to generate a
nucleotide similarity plot in detecting for potential recombination events.36 The similarity plot was
computed with a Kimura (2-parameter) distance model and similarity scores were calculated using
a 250 bp sliding window and step of 10 bp, along with a 50% consensus threshold.
3. Disorder and Phosphorylation Site Predictions
Calculated predictions for protein disorder were determined using PrDOS, IUPred2,
ANCHOR2, DISOPRED3, and PONDR.37-40 PrDOS was run using the standard 5.0% false
positive rate. IUPred2 and ANCHOR2 were both run using the long sequence option with default

settings. DISOPRED3 was run using default settings. PONDR was run using default settings and
the VLXT results were obtained. Predictions for disorder were normalized on a 0.0-1.0 scale for
each program, with values greater than 0.5 to indicate residues with a tendency to be considered
disordered. This prediction method is similar to one previously described; therefore, it is important
to note this method provides a conservative estimate of disorder and prevents the possibility of
over-estimating the disorder for any specific residue.41
To determine which residues are most likely to be phosphorylated, the DEEP online server
was used (http://www.pondr.com/cgi-bin/depp.cgi). Phosphorylation predictions were normalized
on a 0.0-1.0 scale, with values greater than 0.5 to indicate residues having the potential of being
phosphorylated. This method does not guarantee phosphorylation occurs but provides scoring for
the likelihood that phosphorylation would occur for any given serine, threonine, and/or tyrosine
residue within a protein.
4. Homology Modeling
Homology models were built using the NTD in SARS-CoV (PDB: 2OFZ) and carried
out using the MODELLER v9.23 software.42,43 Ten models were built for each sequence and the
model presenting with the lowest discrete optimized protein energy (DOPE) was chosen. Models
were then evaluated using Verify-3D, ERRAT, and PROCHECK on the SAVES v5.0 online
sever (https://servicesn.mbi.ucla.edu/SAVES/). Verify-3D measures the compatibility between
a model and its own amino acid sequence, calculating scores ≥ 80% to indicate ideal
compatibility.44,45 ERRAT measures the quality of non-bonded interactions between atoms,
producing scores ≥ 90 to indicate ideal quality.46 PROCHECK generates a Ramachandran plot to
verify torsion angles and determines if residues are properly built; furthermore, at least ≥ 90% of
these residues should fall within the favorable region.47,48
To ensure a model had the most stable conformation, regions that presented with either low
or moderate scoring were subjected to energy minimization using UCSF Chimera.49 First,
hydrogen atoms were added. Then, charges were assigned using the parameters designated for
standard residues in the AMBER ff14SB option. Lastly, the steepest descent and conjugate
gradient technique was employed with 100 and 10 steps, respectively. The stereochemical quality

of the model was determined again with Verify-3D, ERRAT, and PROCHECK. The model was
reliable if it presented with improved values than previously determined by each program.
5. Comparing Models
Once NTD models were constructed, they were superimposed on UCSF Chimera to
determine root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values.50 Parameters used for superimposition
were defined by the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and a BLOSUM62 scoring matrix, along with
a residue-residue distance cut-off of 5.0 Å. The gap open and extension penalties were 12 and 1,
respectively. All other default settings were maintained. If the RMSD between two models was
low, they were viewed as structurally similar. The structural distance measure (SDM) and Q-Score
were used to evaluate the entire structural similarity among all the NTD models.51,52 Topological
variations within secondary structures, motifs, loops, and/or coils were considered as well. Lastly,
electrostatic surface maps were determined by UCSF Chimera and visualized according to the
default columbic surface coloring schemes.

Results
A total of 10 nucleocapsid gene and protein sequences were used in this study. Among
these sequences, six were from pangolin CoVs, three were from bat CoVs, and the remaining one
was from SARS-CoV-2 (Table S1). To ensure clarity and specificity, the isolate name was used to
differentiate between the multiple pangolin and bat CoVs in the sequence dataset. Notably, five of
the six pangolin CoVs were isolated between 2017-2018.
The SARS-CoV-2 N gene shares a high sequence identity with Bat-CoV RaTG13 (97%)
and Pangolin-CoV MP789 (96%); furthermore, N genes found in pangolin CoVs isolated
between 2017-2018, along with bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45, were found to share
lower identities at 90-91% (Table S2). Similarly, the SARS-CoV-2 N protein shares a high
sequence identity with Bat-CoV RaTG13 (99%) and Pangolin-CoV MP789 (97%). Moreover,
the N proteins in pangolin CoVs isolated between 2017-2018, along with bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and
bat-SL-CoVZC45, were also found to share lower identities at 93-94% (Table S2).
In particular, the alignment revealed that within the N-terminal region of the N proteins
in SARS-CoV-2, Pangolin-CoV MP789, and Bat-CoV RaTG13, each presented with a double
amino acid insertion consisting of arginine and asparagine (Figure 1; Figure S1). This insertion
was observed in bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45; however, bat-SL-CoVZXC21 had
two serine residues while bat-SL-CoVZC45 had arginine and serine. In addition, residues
shared between pangolin and bat CoVs (P37 and Q267) were mutated to S37 and A267
in SARS-CoV-2. Six amino acids (G25, S26, P80, N345, Q349, and T379) were shared only
among N proteins found in SARS-CoV-2, Bat-CoV RaTG13, and Pangolin-CoV MP789;
meanwhile, two additional residues (K65 and D128) were also found but shared only
between Bat-CoV RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2. For pangolin CoVs isolated between 2017–2018,
many conserved amino acid groups were detected throughout the alignment (Figure S1). Lastly,
no sites were found shared only between Pangolin-CoV MP789 and SARS-CoV-2.
Phylogenetic analysis suggests the N gene in SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer
to the N gene found in Bat-CoV RaTG13, followed by a more distant relationship to the N gene
found in Pangolin-CoV MP789 (Figure 2A). In addition, the N genes found in pangolin CoVs
that were isolated between 2017-2018 formed a polytomy while bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and

bat-SL-CoVZC45 functioned as sister taxa that were distant from all other N genes in the
tree (Figure 2A). Phylogenetic analysis of the N protein revealed the same groupings of CoVs
as presented in the gene tree; however, the topology is different (Figure 2B). The protein tree
shows bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and bat-SL-CoVZC45 in closer relation to SARS-CoV-2, whereas
both CoVs in the gene tree held a lesser relationship to SARS-CoV-2. Conversely, the
gene tree has pangolin CoVs isolated between 2017-2018 in closer relation to SARS-CoV-2,
unlike the protein tree where they have a lesser relation to SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2).
Based on the phylogenetic positions of each N protein, one representative sequence
was selected from each split in the tree for additional analysis. From this, N proteins that
belonged to SARS-CoV-2, Bat-CoV RaTG13, Pangolin-CoV MP789, bat-SL-CoVZXC21,
and Pangolin-CoV GX-P5L were chosen. It was found that the NTD in SARS-CoV-2 is 100%
identical to the NTD in Bat-CoV RaTG13 while the CTD in SARS-CoV-2 is 99% identical to
the CTD in Bat-CoV RaTG13 (Table 1). The N protein domains in Pangolin-CoV MP789 shared
a very high identity with SARS-CoV-2 at 98% for the NTD and CTD as well (Table 1). In fact, all
of the selected N protein sequences expressed high levels of identity for the NTD and CTD with
the lowest values being only 94% and 96%, respectively (Table 1). Nucleotide sequences
corresponding to each domain followed similar trends as well; however, it is interesting that
the NTD holds noticeably higher nucleotide identities than does the CTD (Table 1). Furthermore,
phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences revealed the NTD in SARS-CoV-2 is genetically
similar to the NTDs found in Bat-CoV RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoV MP789, whereas the analysis
of amino acid sequences revealed the NTD in SARS-CoV-2 is closer in relation to the NTD found
in Bat-CoV RaTG13 (Figure S2 A,B). Conversely, phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences
revealed the CTD in SARS-CoV-2, Bat-CoV RaTG13, and Pangolin-CoV MP789 are genetically
similar, with the same topology observed in the protein tree as well (Figure S2 C,D). In regard to
both Pangolin-CoV GX-P5L and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, they either formed phylogenetically distinct
sister taxa or independent lineages based on their NTDs and CTDs (Figure S2).
A similarity plot reveals that sequence identities are not homogenous among N genes
found within SARS-CoV-2, Bat-CoV RaTG13, Pangolin-CoV MP789, bat-SL-CoVZXC21,
and Pangolin-CoV GX-P5L. The complete span of the N gene found in Bat-CoV RaTG13 shares
higher nucleotide identity with Pangolin-CoV MP789 and SARS-CoV-2 than with either

bat-SL-CoVZXC21 or Pangolin-CoV GX-P5L (Figure 3). However, nucleotides 485-565 found
in Pangolin-CoV MP789, bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and Bat-CoV RaTG13 share nearly the
same identity to each other and with SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3). Interestingly, that same region does
not possess any shared identity alongside Pangolin-CoV GX-P5L. As with percent identities, this
similarity plot also reveals how the NTD and CTD in Bat-CoV RaTG13 is most similar to
the domains in SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3).
Disorder predictions for the N protein revealed nearly identical values of disorder for each
residue (Table S3). Higher values of disorder were observed in the NTR, LKR, and CTR; however,
slight variations were observed for these regions (Figure 4). As for the NTD and CTD, both
domains presented with values that were either below or near the disorder threshold; however, the
beginning of the CTD showed higher values of disorder that gradually decreased when moving
further into the domain (Figure 4). The detection of phosphorylation sites presented similar
scoring among each N protein; however, residues with scores suggesting phosphorylation existed
mainly within the NTR, LKR, and CTR (Table S4; Figure 5). Interestingly, residues found in
the LKR had nearly identical scores whereas residues in the NTR and CTR presented with
more varied amounts of scoring (Figure 5).
Once homology models were constructed, they were refined and validated to meet
appropriate energy and stereochemical parameters (Table S5). Models were then superimposed
to yield RMSD values (Figure 4A; Table 2). From this, the NTDs in Pangolin-CoV MP789
and Bat-CoV RaTG13 were structurally similar to the NTD found in SARS-CoV-2; furthermore,
the NTDs found in Pangolin-CoV GX-P5L and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 each showed greater structural
similarity towards the NTD found in Pangolin-CoV MP789. The overall RMSD was 0.385, along
with a calculated SDM and Q-score of 7.686 and 0.984, respectively. These values indicate that
there is a significantly high structural similarity among all the constructed CoV NTDs.
In looking at specific motifs, the β-hairpin (amino acids 93–102) is where a majority of
topological diversity can be observed (Figure 6B). The variations in this motif were largely present
in the loop connecting both β-sheets; however, the β-sheets found in Bat-CoV RaTG13 present
with a slightly different topology in comparison with the other CoV NTDs. Visually, the β-hairpin
region in SARS-CoV-2 extends furthest from the protein core while also bending closest towards
the nucleotide binding site. Oppositely, the β-hairpin region in Pangolin-CoV GX-P5L extends the

shortest distance from the protein core. Additionally, the β-hairpin region in Bat-CoV RaTG13
appears as an intermediate that does not extend as far or as short when compared with those
in SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV GX-P5L. As for β-hairpin regions in Pangolin-CoV MP789
and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, they expressed the greatest similarity. Interestingly, the β-hairpin motif
ultimately varies topologically despite homogeneity in amino identity, except at residue 94
in Pangolin-CoV GX-P5L which is valine instead of isoleucine (Figure S1). As a result of these
differences, the surface features of the β-hairpin are varied, thereby presenting with differences in
the distribution of positive charge as well (Figure S3).
Three other variations were observed. First, residues 123-125 in Pangolin-CoV MP789
showed a relaxed loop; however, it is not clear why this region is different as amino acids within
this region are the same when compared to the CoV NTDs that do not present with this
feature (Figure 6C; Figure S1). Second, residues 128-129 in Bat-CoV RaTG13 showed another
relaxed loop. At residue position 128, the amino acid found was aspartic acid and is shared only
with SARS-CoV-2 while the other CoV NTDs possess glutamic acid (Figure S1). Even though
amino acid identity for this region is shared with SARS-CoV-2, only Bat-CoV RaTG13 displayed
this relaxed loop (Figure 6D). Third, in the NTD for Pangolin-CoV MP789 residues 135-138
presented with a relaxed coil (Figure 6E). At residue 135, all other CoV NTDs have threonine
while Pangolin-CoV MP789 possesses asparagine (Figure S1). Besides this difference, the
remainder of this region holds the same amino acid identity for all NTDs.
Electrostatic potential maps revealed similar but innately visible differences in electrostatic
surface patterns for each CoV NTD model (Figure S3). As expected, the positive charge was
consolidated primarily throughout the β-hairpin region and upper binding groove. Interestingly,
residue 80 within the 3/10-helices of the NTDs in both Pangolin-CoV GX-P5L and
bat-SL-CoVZXC21 is lysine (Figure S1). Because of this extra positively charged amino acid, a
small region of positive charge is visible on the top portion of their NTDs (Figure S3). This was
not observed in other models; however, other NTDs that were not built presented with lysine at
this site (Figure S1). The likely function and possible advantage of this residue was not determined
in this study, but an investigation looking further into this residue is warranted.

Discussion
Based on nucleotide and amino acid identity, the N gene and protein in SARS-CoV-2
share highest identity with the N gene and protein in Bat-CoV RaTG13; although, the N gene and
protein found in Pangolin-CoV MP789 share nearly identical values. Each phylogenetic tree
has Pangolin-CoV MP789 diverging prior to the SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-CoV RaTG13 sister
group. This does not imply SARS-CoV-2 rose directly from either Pangolin-CoV MP789
or Bat-CoV RaTG13, but this is evidence of a close phylogenetic relationship. Additionally, it is
unknown whether or not the common ancestors which gave rise to these lineages of CoVs are still
in existence. At most, these data suggest a naturally intermingled bat and pangolin origin
for SARS-CoV-2; however, the scope of this relationship is largely unclear. Both the N genes and
proteins found among pangolin CoVs isolated between 2017-2018, bat-SL-CoVZXC21,
and bat-SL-CoVZC45 expressed lower identities suggesting a slightly weaker relation
to SARS-CoV-2. Perhaps these groups of viruses served as precursors that contributed to the
evolutionary development of the SARS-CoV-2, Bat-CoV RaTG13, and Pangolin-CoV MP789
lineages. Alternatively, there is possibly an unsampled and circulating CoV in nature that is
a missing link in the evolutionary history for SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the NTD and CTD in
the SARS-CoV-2 N protein share highest identity with Bat-CoV RaTG13, followed by close
identity with Pangolin-CoV MP789 as well. Slightly higher amino acid conservation than
nucleotide conservation was observed for the entire N protein and both domains. Even though
shared nucleotide identities were not extremely lower, this does suggest enough time has passed
for silent mutations and/or genetic drift to begin taking minor effects on the N gene. In addition,
the obvious redundancy in the genetic code likely contributes to this feature as well. Nucleotide
data suggests the NTD is more conserved within the N gene. The NTD might be facing different
selective pressures that are working to maintain less variability in nucleotide identity.
At the start of the N protein in SARS-CoV-2, Pangolin-CoV MP789, Bat-CoV RaTG13,
bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and bat-SL-CoVZC45 all present with a double amino acid insertion. Though
naturally occurring mutations are still possible, a recombination event could have occurred in
these CoVs. Even so, sequences used in this study provide little evidence as to how this would
have occurred. As previously suggested, perhaps an unsampled and widely circulating CoV in
nature is responsible for introducing this type of insertion. Nonetheless, this feature reinforces a

shared evolutionary history among these CoVs. In respect to the entire N protein, the NTR is
disordered and functions in RNA-binding.26 The advantage of this insertion within the NTR is not
clear, but it might help to further promote effective RNA-binding. For example, the insertions
found within SARS-CoV-2, Pangolin-CoV MP789, Bat-CoV RaTG13, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21
possess arginine which is a positively charged amino acid that likely interacts with RNA. If so,
this could have greater implications on the pathogenicity of CoVs possessing this insertion, such
as in SARS-CoV-2. Experimental analysis could be an essential tool in determining the relative
importance of this double insertion.
As for the amino acid residues specific to SARS-CoV-2, a prior study identified A267 as
a positively selected site on an exposed loop within the CTD and is thought to evolve in a manner
that might establish, maintain, or avoid binding of different host molecules.13 However, it appears
little has been discussed about S37 which is found in the N-terminal region. According to the
protein alignment, this residue is flanked by arginine and lysine residues. If a purpose for this
mutation exists, it most likely associates with RNA binding. This serine could be phosphorylated,
yielding a conformational change that allows flanking electropositive amino acids to bind with
an RNA molecule. Although majority of phosphorylation sites are within the LKR region, a prior
study investigating the SARS-CoV N protein found additional sites elsewhere, including
the N-terminal region.26,53 Therefore, it is possible S37 could undergo phosphorylation to promote
effective and high affinity RNA-binding. In support of this function, the prediction method that
detected for residues likely to undergo phosphorylation indicated that S37 (score: 0.766) has a high
potential of being phosphorylated. Experimental analysis is absolutely necessary to confirm this
hypothesis. Alternatively, S37 lacks any functional role and is just the result of a random
non-deleterious mutation. Lastly, both residues (S37 and A267) in SARS-CoV-2 were originally
found by Zhang et al. 2020; therefore, sequence data in this study corroborates their findings.
Recombination analysis resulted in minimal evidence that recombination has occurred in
the N gene. However, the N genes in Pangolin-CoV MP789 and Bat-CoV RaTG13 might be
composed of a small fragment originally found in bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Considering that
bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and Bat-CoV RaTG13 circulate among Rhinolophus affinis, perhaps a
recombination event originated in that species and then made way into Manis javanica, resulting
in a second recombination event between bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and Pangolin-CoV MP789. With

bat-SL-CoVZXC21 serving as the source, this path of recombination is possible given the N gene
is more conserved among Pangolin-CoV MP789 and Bat-CoV RaTG13. A recent study
of the S gene in Pangolin-CoV MP789 suggested this specific gene was constructed by fragments
found in either bat-SL-CoVZXC21 or bat-SL-CoVZC45, and from Bat-CoV RaTG13.8 Therefore,
evidence of these CoVs having undergone recombination at some point is apparent and that
nucleotides 485–565 for the N gene in SARS-CoV-2 was introduced from potential recombination
events among Pangolin-CoV MP789, Bat-CoV RaTG13, and bat-SL-CoVZXC21.
Structurally, the NTD in Pangolin-CoV MP789 and Bat-CoV RaTG13 are similar to
the NTD in SARS-CoV-2. This structural data reinforces the sequence-based phylogeny that
reveals a shared evolutionary history for these CoVs. Among these NTDs, the region which
displays the greatest topological variation is the β-hairpin motif. A recent study performed
by Kang et al. 2020 elucidated the crystal structure for the NTD in SARS-CoV-2, and researchers
discovered that when compared to the NTDs found in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43,
the β-hairpin presented structural and topological variations.54 From this, it is understood these
differences likely result in adaptive features that determine how specific CoV N proteins will
bind to their own RNA genomes. Varying electrostatic surface potentials help support this
concept. With varying distributions of positive charge, the mode of binding for the NTD will vary
among N proteins. These differences in binding were also noted by Kang et al. 2020 in which
they found the NTD in SARS-CoV-2 employs a unique binding pattern for ribonucleotides when
compared to binding patterns for domains in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-OC43.54 For
the NTDs found in SARS-CoV-2, Pangolin-CoV MP789, and Bat-CoV RaTG13 a structural
relationship exists. However, electrostatic surfaces suggest unique modes of RNA-binding. Given
that structures for the NTDs in Bat-CoV RaTG13 and Pangolin-CoV MP789 share greater
similarity to the NTD in SARS-CoV-2 than with each other, it is likely these CoVs influenced the
evolution leading up to the structural features observed in the SARS-CoV-2 NTD and how it
binds to the genome. Also, an extended β-hairpin in SARS-CoV-2 might allow for a larger binding
pocket that can accommodate RNA possessing higher ordered structure. Moreover, bending closer
towards the binding site could permit a potentially tighter interaction with the genome. Discussed
by Kang et al. 2020, they describe the N-terminal tail in the NTD as flexible and extending
outward; therefore, this feature and the β-hairpin region might function together in allowing for a
binding site that contains RNA of higher ordered structure.54 This could have further implications

on how the genome is packaged when forming a helical nucleocapsid to make a complete
virion. In addition, the topological variations observed in the β-hairpin region are likely not the
result of intrinsic disorder. According to the disorder plot, this region presents with values that are
slightly above the set threshold; however, these values are minimal enough that it is more likely
residues comprising the β-hairpin region are ordered but perhaps moderately flexible in terms
of accomplishing the most effective means of RNA-binding. Altogether, variations in β-hairpin
topology could reflect how an N protein’s NTD interacts with a specified RNA genome.
Another recent study that identified epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 N protein found
the N protein in pangolin CoV failed to align with two of those epitope sequences.55 From this, the
authors claim separations exist between functional adaptation and molecular evolution. There are
variations between NTDs in SARS-CoV-2 and Pangolin-CoV MP789; despite their N proteins
having a close evolutionary history. These differences in the NTD are likely reflective of
adaptive functions in each N protein; therefore, it is likely there are features inherent only to
the SARS-CoV-2 N protein that require further investigation. An example of such a specific
feature would be the attributes associated with the β-hairpin motif. Given the N protein is
immunogenic, knowing the sequence and structural differences can be useful for developing
antigens in serological detection, antiviral medications, and vaccine candidates.11,55
In regard to the flexible loops and coil in Pangolin-CoV MP789 and Bat-CoV RaTG13,
these features might also be inherent to their respective NTDs. Based on the data used to verify
homology models, it seems these features are not errors as each model presented with ideal
values for energy and stereochemical quality. For example, only asparagine is found at residue 135
in Pangolin-CoV MP789; therefore, this could affect spatial arrangements of subsequent amino
acids and cause a looser coil to form (Figure S1). Though data is not shown, attempts at correcting
these regions were done but resulted in lower stereochemical quality. In order to preserve a valid
structure these flexible coils were not tampered with and kept as they were. Experimentally
derived crystal structures for the NTD in these CoVs could help corroborate these findings.
It is clear CoVs originate in bats and can spillover into the human population through an
intermediate host, such as with palm civets transmitting SARS-CoV.13,14 Unfortunately, this study
does not provide evidence that pangolins are intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 nor provide
many insights into the chain of events leading up to the human spillover event. A major setback

of this study is the lack of sequence data. With few sequences available from CoVs that are closely
related to SARS-CoV-2, understanding the viruses’ origin is more difficult. However, by using
the N gene and protein, this study was able to reinforce the existence of a close phylogenetic
relationship among SARS-CoV-2, Bat-CoV RaTG13, and Pangolin-CoV MP789. Although the
evolutionary history is similar, the N proteins in these CoVs seem to possess structural features
that reflect upon adaptive functions specific to the CoVs they associate with. By continuing the
surveillance of CoVs in bats and pangolins, it can help collect additional sequence information
that can make greater sense of the relationship occurring between these CoVs. Ultimately, this
would allow us to better understand the history of SARS-CoV-2 and what it could imply for the
future should another novel CoV emerge causing a disease more dangerous than COVID-19.
