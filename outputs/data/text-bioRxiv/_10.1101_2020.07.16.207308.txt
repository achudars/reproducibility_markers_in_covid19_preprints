Abstract
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many life scientists are focused on SARS-CoV-2. To
help them use available structural data, we systematically modeled all viral proteins using all
related 3D structures, generating 872 models that provide detail not available elsewhere. To
organise these models, we created a structural coverage map: a novel, one-stop visualization
summarizing what is — and is not — known about the 3D structure of the viral proteome. The
map highlights structural evidence for viral protein interactions, mimicry, and hijacking; it also
helps researchers find 3D models of interest, which can then be mapped with UniProt,
PredictProtein,
or
CATH
features.
The
resulting
Aquaria-COVID
resource
(​https://aquaria.ws/covid​) helps scientists understand molecular mechanisms underlying
coronavirus infection. Based on insights gained using our resource, we propose mechanisms by
which the virus may enter immune cells, sense the cell type, then switch focus from viral
reproduction to disrupting host immune responses.

Significance
Currently, much of the COVID-19 viral proteome has unknown molecular structure. To improve
this, we generated ~1,000 structural models, designed to capture multiple states for each viral
protein. To organise these models, we created a structure coverage map: a novel, one-stop
visualization summarizing what is — and is not — known about viral protein structure. We used
these data to create an online resource, designed to help COVID-19 researchers gain insight
into the key molecular processes that drive infection. Based on insights gained using our
resource, we speculate that the virus may sense the type of cells it infects and, within certain
cells, it may switch from reproduction to disruption of the immune system.

Introduction
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many life scientists have recently switched focus towards
SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2). This includes structural
biologists, who have so far determined ~300 Protein Data Bank (PDB) entries (1) for the 27 viral
proteins.
These structures are, in turn, driving molecular modeling studies, most focused on the spike
glycoprotein (2). Some modelling studies focus on breadth of coverage, predicting 3D structures
for the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome; this has been done using AlphaFold (3), C-I-TASSER (4),
Rosetta (5), and SwissModel (6). Unfortunately, these predictions vary greatly (7), raising
accuracy concerns; additionally, these approaches derive few structural states for each viral
protein, thereby producing moderate total numbers of models (e.g., 24 for AlphaFold and 116
for SwissModel).
We aim to address these limitations via a depth-based strategy that models multiple states for
each viral protein, using all related 3D structures in the PDB — thus leveraging structures
determined for other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV, BtCoV-HKU4 (bat coronavirus HKU4),
FCoV (feline coronavirus), IBV (avian infectious bronchitis virus), and MHV-A59 (mouse
hepatitis virus A59), as well as distant viruses, such as CHIKV (Chikungunya virus) and FMDV
(foot-and-mouth disease virus).
Combining breadth and depth of coverage requires modeling methods with low computational
cost; here, we use only sequence profile comparisons (8) to align viral sequences onto
experimentally derived 3D structures (9). This generates what we call minimal models, in which
3D coordinates are not modified, but are mapped onto SARS-CoV-2 sequences using coloring
that indicates model quality (10).
Minimal models have benefits: it is easy to understand how they were derived, helping assess
the validity of insights gained. Thus, minimal models are broadly useful, even for researchers
who are not modelling experts. Conversely, models generated by more sophisticated methods
(3) can be more accurate, but require more time and expertise to assess their accuracy (7) and
the validity of insights gained; this often limits their usefulness.
Large numbers of models can be generated by such minimal strategies, raising a new problem:
how to visually organize such complex datasets to be usable. We consider this one instance of
a critical issue impeding not just COVID-19 research, but all life sciences (11). Thus, we
introduce a novel concept: a one-stop visualization summarizing what is known - and not known
- about the 3D structure of the viral proteome. This tailored visualization — called the
SARS-CoV-2 structural coverage map — helps researchers find structural models related to
specific research questions.
Once a structural model of interest is found, it can be used to explore the spatial arrangement of
sequence features — i.e., residue-based annotations, such as nonsynonymous mutations or
post-translational modifications. Here, we integrated SARS-CoV-2 models into Aquaria (9), a
molecular graphics system designed to simplify feature mapping and make minimal models

broadly accessible to researchers who are not modelling experts. Previously, Aquaria could only
map features from UniProt (12); for this work, we added >32,000 SARS-CoV-2 features from
additional sources, and we also refactored Aquaria to improve performance.
The resulting Aquaria-COVID resource (​https://aquaria.ws/covid​) comprises a large set of
SARS-CoV-2 structural information not readily available elsewhere. The resource also identifies
structurally dark regions of the proteome, i.e., regions with no significant sequence similarity to
any protein region observed by experimental structure determination (13). Clearly identifying
such regions helps direct future research to reveal viral protein functions that are currently
unknown.
Below, we describe the resource and systematically review insights it provides for each viral
protein. We then discuss how these insights, taken together, reveal how viral proteins
self-assemble, and how they may mimic (14) host proteins and hijack (15) host processes,
including innate and adaptive immunity, nonsense-mediated decay, ubiquitination, and
regulation of chromatin and telomeres.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Aquaria-COVID resource aims to fulfil a vital role by
helping scientists more rapidly explore and assess evidence for the molecular mechanisms that
underlie coronavirus infection — and to keep abreast of emerging knowledge, as new 3D
structures and sequence features become available.

Results
Our study was based on 14 UniProt (12) sequences that comprise the SARS-CoV-2 proteome
(Table S1). We matched these against sequences of all available 3D structures in the PDB (1)
— using profiles made with HHblits (8) — resulting in 872 minimal models (Tables S2-S4) that
we incorporated into Aquaria (9), where they can be mapped with >32,000 features from
UniProt, CATH (16), SNAP2 (17), and PredictProtein (18). These features include
residue-based prediction scores for conservation, disorder, domains, flexibility, mutational
propensity, subcellular location, and transmembrane helices (see Methods for details). To help
other researchers use these models and features, we extensively refactored Aquaria to improve
cross-platform performance, and created a matrix layout giving access to models for the 14 viral
sequences (​https://aquaria.ws/covid#matrix​). We also created a structural coverage map (Figs.
1 & 2; ​https://aquaria.ws/covid​) — a novel visual layout based on the viral genome organization.
The coverage map summarizes key results obtained, including evidence for viral mimicry (Fig.
3) or hijacking of host proteins (Fig. 4), as well as viral protein interactions (Fig. 5). For each of
the structural states shown in Fig. 2, a representative minimal model is specified via its Aquaria
identifier in Table S5. In the following three sections of the Results, we systematically present
key findings from structural models associated with three key regions of the viral genome; these
sections are intended to be read with close reference to Fig. 2.

Polyprotein 1a
Polyprotein 1a (a.k.a. PP1a) derives from polyprotein 1ab (a.k.a. PP1ab), and is cleaved into 10
proteins (NSP1–NSP10) that modify viral proteins, disable host defenses, and support viral
replication.
NSP1 derives from residues 1–180 of PP1a and is thought to interact with the ribosome,
suppressing translation of host mRNAs and promoting their degradation (19). We found two
structures matching most of the NSP1 sequence (Fig. 1), both determined for NSP1 from
SARS-CoV, which had 85% pairwise sequence identity to the matched region of NSP1 from
SARS-CoV-2. These sequence-to-structure alignments were generated using HHblits sequence
profiles (8), and had a significance score (E-value) of 10​-20​, giving an estimated ≥ 97% likelihood
that NSP1 from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 adopt similar structures (9). The more recent
structure (with Aquaria identifier ​P0DTC1/2gdt​) was selected for the representative image (Figs.
1 & 2), which was colored to convey alignment quality (10). Unfortunately, neither structure
showed interactions with other proteins or RNA and — unusually — they provided few functional
insights (20), partly because they had a unique fold with no matches in CATH (16). NSP1 also
had two short dark regions resulting from alignment gaps (Figs. 1 & 2); the N-terminal dark
region may be accounted for by high flexibility (average predicted B-value = 60; see Methods).
NSP2 (PP1a 181–818) may disrupt intracellular signaling by interacting with host proteins (21).
Unfortunately, these interactions are not captured in the single matching structure (Figs. 1 & 2)
derived for NSP2 from IBV, a remote homolog with 11% pairwise sequence identity to the
matched region of PP1a (residues 104–562). However, the HHblits E-value was 10​-32​, giving
≥ 98.5% likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 NSP2 adopts a similar structure — a stronger prediction
than for NSP1 (above), largely because the matched region was much longer. Interestingly, the
matched region partly overlapped NSP1 (PP1a 104–180). NSP2 also had multiple short dark
regions, resulting from alignment gaps, plus a long C-terminal dark region (Figs. 1 & 2). The
Aquaria webpage for this matching structure showed that — unusually — there is no scientific
publication associated with this 10 year-old dataset (Table S5). Thus, while it may be of some
use for researchers focused on NSP2, for most researchers this structure should probably be
excluded, making NSP2 an entirely dark protein.
NSP3 (PP1a 819–2763) is a large, multidomain protein thought to perform many functions,
including anchoring the viral replication complex to double-membrane vesicles derived from the
endoplasmic reticulum (22). NSP3 had 188 matching structures clustered in nine distinct
sequence regions.
NSP3 region 1 (a.k.a. Ubl1; PP1a 819–929) was the least conserved NSP3 region (average
ConSurf score = 3.7; see Methods), suggesting it adapts to host-specific defenses. Ubl1 is
thought to bind single-stranded RNA and the viral nucleocapsid protein (22). Unfortunately,
these interactions are not shown in the three matching structures found, which all adopt a
ubiquitin-like topology (CATH ​3.10.20.350​). Although it has distinct structural differences, Ubl1
may mimic host ubiquitin (22); however, we found no matches to structures of human ubiquitin,
undermining the mimicry hypothesis. For the representative image (Fig. 2), we used the
top-ranked matching structure provided in the Aquaria interface; further details about this and all
models mentioned below are given in Table S5.

NSP3 region 2 (PP1a 930–1026) had no matches in CATH and no matching structures. This
was the NSP3 region with lowest predicted sensitivity to mutation (median sensitivity 0%; see
Methods), highest predicted flexibility (average B-factor = 55), highest fraction of disordered
residues (47%), and highest fraction of residues predicted to be solvent-accessible (99%). We
speculate that this region acts as a flexible linker and may contain post-translational
modification sites hijacking host signalling, as are often found in viral disordered regions (15).
NSP3 region 3 (PP1a 1027–1193) has a macro domain (CATH ​3.40.220.10​) that may
counteract innate immunity via interfering with ADP-ribose (ADPr) modification (22). This was
the second least conserved NSP3 region (ConSurf = 3.9) and had the highest fraction of
mutationally sensitive residues (29%), suggesting it is well adapted to specific hosts. This region
had 144 matching structures (Fig. 2; Table S5). Of the matching structures, 47 were of human
proteins (Figs. 2 & 3A), suggesting these host proteins may be mimicked by the virus. The
potentially mimicked human proteins were: GDAP2, MACROD1, MACROD2, MACROH2A1,
MACROH2A2, OARD1, PARP9, PARP14, and PARP15. An additional 56 structures matched to
viral proteins, two in complex with RNA. For brevity here and in Fig. 2, we have omitted the
remaining 41 matching structures derived from other host organisms (Table S2).
NSP3 region 4 (PP1a 1027–1368) comprised a disordered region plus a macro-like domain
called SUD-N (CATH ​3.40.220.30​) that may bind RNA (22). This region had no matching
structures.
NSP3 region 5 (PP1a 1389–1493) comprised another macro-like domain called SUD-M (CATH
3.40.220.20​) that may bind both RNA and host proteins, and take part in viral replication (22).
However, no interactions are shown in the seven matching structures found. Comparing these
with structures matching NSP3 region 3, we see considerable differences and no evidence of
mimicry of host macro domains (Fig. 2).
NSP3 region 6 (PP1a 1494–1562) comprised a domain called SUD-C (CATH ​2.30.30.590​) and
had two matching structures, one of which also spanned NSP3 region 7. Using these structures,
Lei et al. speculated that this region may bind metal ions and induce oxidative stress (22).
NSP3 region 7 (PP1a 1563–1878) comprises a papain-like protease (a.k.a. PL-Pro), made up of
three domains (CATH ​3.10.20.540​, ​1.10.8.1190​, and ​3.90.70.90​) thought to cleave
NSP1–NSP3 from the polyprotein and to cleave ubiquitin-like modifications from host proteins
(Fig. 4A), thereby undermining interferon-induced antiviral activity (22). PL-Pro had 38 matching
structures, of which 11 show binding to human ubiquitin-like proteins (Figs. 2 & 4A): four
showed binding to ISG15; two showed binding to UBA52; two showed binding to UBB; one
showed binding to UBC, and one showed binding to both UBB and UBC. Two additional
matching structures showed the PL-Pro region in complex with inhibitory peptides.
NSP3 region 8 (PP1a 1879–2020) comprises a nucleic-acid binding domain (a.k.a. NAB)
thought to bind single-stranded RNA and to unwind double-stranded DNA (22). NAB had only
one matching structure with a fold not seen in any other PDB structure (CATH ​3.40.50.11020​).
NSP3 region 9 (PP1a 2021–2763) may anchor NSP3 to double-membrane vesicles (22). This
was the most conserved NSP3 region (ConSurf = 4.9), suggesting it is less adapted to specific
hosts. This region had no CATH matches and no matching structures.
NSP4 (PP1a 2764–3263) may act with NSP3 and NSP6 to create the double-membrane
vesicles required for viral replication (23). NSP4 mostly comprised a dark region (PP1a

2764–3172) with no CATH matches, no disorder, and multiple transmembrane helices. The
C-terminal region (PP1a 3173–3263) comprised a domain called NSP4C (CATH ​1.10.150.420​)
that had three matching structures; all were homodimers, although NSP4C is thought to act as a
monomer (24).
NSP5 (a.k.a. 3CL-Pro; PP1a 3264–3569) is a two-domain protein (CATH ​2.40.10.10 and
1.10.1840.10​) thought to cleave the viral polyprotein at 11 sites, resulting in NSP5–NSP16.
NSP5 had 256 matching structures — more than any other viral protein — of which, 15 showed
binding to inhibitory peptides.
NSP6 (PP1a 3570–3859) is a transmembrane protein thought to act with NSP3 and NSP4 to
create double-membrane vesicles (23). Of the 15 PP1ab proteins, NSP6 was the only
completely dark protein and was the least conserved (ConSurf = 2.9). NSP6 also had no CATH
matches and no disordered regions.
NSP7 (PP1a 3860–3942) may support viral genome replication (25); it had 15 matching
structures, some showing interactions with other viral proteins (Figs. 2 & 5A). In two structures,
NSP7 occurred as a monomer, while the remaining 13 structures showed NSP7 bound to
NSP8. Six of these structures also showed binding to NSP12; two of these six structures also
showed binding to RNA. NSP7 comprises an antiparallel helical bundle (CATH ​1.10.8.370​) that
adopts distinct substates, depending on its interaction partners (Fig. 5A).
NSP8 (PP1a 3943–4140) is also thought to support viral genome replication (25). It features a
highly conserved (ConSurf = 7.3) ‘tail’ segment (PP1a 3943–4041), predominantly helical with
some disordered residues and no CATH matches, followed by a less conserved (ConSurf = 5.7)
‘head’ domain (PP1a 4042–4140), with a beta barrel fold (CATH ​2.40.10.290​). NSP8 had 14
matching structures, all showing interactions to other viral proteins (Figs. 2 & 5A). One structure
showed binding to NSP12 only, while the remaining 13 structures all showed binding to NSP7.
Six of these 13 structures also showed binding to NSP12, and two of these six showed binding
to RNA as well.
NSP9 (PP1a 4141–4253) may bind single-stranded RNA and take part in genome replication
(26). NSP9 had 14 matching structures, all with beta barrel architecture (CATH ​2.40.10.250​)
and mostly homodimers — thought to be the functional state (26).
NSP10 (P
​ P1a 4254–4392) is thought to act with NSP14 and NSP16 to cap and proofread RNA
during genome replication (27). NSP10 had no CATH matches, yet had 33 matching structures,
some showing interactions to other viral proteins (Figs. 2 & 5B). In one matching structure,
NSP10 was monomeric, while in two structures, NSP10 was a homododecamer that formed a
hollow sphere (Fig. 1). Four matching structures showed binding to NSP14, while the remaining
26 structures showed binding to NSP16.

Polyprotein 1b
Polyprotein 1b (a.k.a. PP1b) is cleaved by 3CL-Pro into five proteins (NSP12–NSP16) that drive
replication of viral RNA. These proteins were predicted to have no disordered regions, no
transmembrane helices, very few dark regions, and to be highly conserved (ConSurf = 5.3–6.6),
compared with PP1a proteins (ConSurf = 2.9–5.6).

NSP12 (PP1ab 4393–5324) is an RNA-directed RNA polymerase (a.k.a. RdRp) thought to drive
viral genome replication (28). NSP12 was the second most conserved PP1ab protein
(ConSurf = 6.5), and had 47 matching structures, many showing interactions to other viral
proteins (Figs. 2 & 5A). One structure showed binding to NSP8, while four structures showed
binding to both NSP8 and NSP7; two of these four also showed binding to RNA. An additional
15 structures showed binding to RNA only, while one structure showed binding to both RNA and
DNA.
NSP13 (PP1ab 5325–5925) is a multi-functional helicase thought to unwind double-stranded
RNA and DNA, and to be a core component of the viral replication complex (29). The N-terminal
half of NSP13 (PP1ab 5325–5577) had no matches in CATH, while the C-terminal half
contained two Rossman fold domains (CATH ​3.40.50.300​). NSP13 had 64 matching structures,
of which 23 showed potential mimicry of four human helicase proteins (Figs. 2 & 3B). Two of
these structures showed matching between PIF1 and the first Rossman fold domain (PP1ab
5597–5733). A further 11 structures showed matching between AQR and the second Rossman
fold domain plus part of the first; of these structures, 10 showed AQR bound to the spliceosome.
The remaining 10 structures matched to both Rossman fold domains: eight of these structures
showed mimicry of UPF1, of which two structures also showed binding to UPF2; finally, two
structures showed mimicry of IGHMBP2, of which one structure also showed binding with RNA.
A further 41 structures showed matches to viral proteins, of which four structures also showed
binding to DNA.
NSP14 (PP1ab 5926–6452) is a proofreading exoribonuclease thought to remove 3'-terminal
nucleotides from RNA, thereby reducing mutations during viral genome replication (30). NSP14
had no matches in CATH, but had four matching structures, all in complex with NSP10 (Figs. 2
& 5B).
NSP15 (PP1ab 6453–6798) is a uridylate-specific endoribonuclease thought to support viral
genome replication (31). The N-terminal region of NSP15 had two domains (CATH ​2.20.25.360
and ​3.40.50.11580​), while the C-terminal region (PP1ab 6642–6798) had none. NSP15 had 19
matching structures, none showing matching to — or interactions with — human proteins, or
with other viral proteins (Fig. 2).
NSP16 (PP1ab 6799–7096) may methylate viral mRNA caps, following replication, which is
thought to be important for evading host immune defenses (32). This was also the most
conserved PP1ab protein (ConSurf = 6.6). NSP16 had a Rossman fold domain (CATH
3.40.50.150​) that had 26 matching structures, all showing binding to NSP10 (Figs. 2 & 5B).

Virion and Accessory Proteins
The 3’ end of the genome encodes 12 proteins, many involved in virion assembly. Remarkably,
our analysis found no interactions between these proteins.
Spike glycoprotein binds host receptors, thereby initiating membrane fusion and viral entry (33).
This protein has four UniProt domains, of which one (S1-CTD; residues 334–527) binds to host
receptors (Fig. 4B). Aquaria found 136 matching structures clustered in two regions (Fig. 2).
One was a heptad repeat region (HR2), with 15 matching structures, of which four structures
showed binding to antibodies. The second region had 121 matching structures, of which 68
showed binding to antibodies and two structures showed binding to inhibitory peptides. Of the

remaining structures, 18 showed interaction with human proteins (Figs. 2 & 4B): 15 showed
binding to ACE2, of which one structure also showed binding to SLC6A19; finally, three
structures showed binding to DPP4.
ORF3a may act as a homotetramer, forming an ion channel in host cell membranes that helps
with virion release (34). ORF3a had no matching structures.
The envelope protein (a.k.a. E protein) matched two structures; one was a monomer while the
other was a pentamer, forming an ion channel thought to span the viral envelope (35).
The matrix glycoprotein (a.k.a. M protein) is also thought to be part of the viral envelope (36).
The matrix glycoprotein had no matching structures.
ORF6 may block expression of interferon stimulated genes (e.g., ISG15) that have antiviral
activity (37). ORF6 had no matching structures.
ORF7a may interfere with the host cell surface protein BST2, preventing it from tethering virions
(38). ORF7a had three matching structures.
ORF7b is an integral membrane protein thought to localize to the Golgi compartment and the
virion envelope (39). ORF7b had no matching structures.
ORF8 is thought to inhibit type 1 interferon signaling (40); it is also very different to proteins from
other coronaviruses. ORF8 had no matching structures.
The nucleocapsid protein (a.k.a. N protein) is thought to package the viral genome during virion
assembly through interaction with the matrix glycoprotein, and also to become ADP-ribosylated
(41). Depending on its phosphorylation state, this protein may also switch function, translocating
to the nucleus and interacting with the host genome (42). This protein had 35 matching
structures clustered in two regions: the N-terminal region had 24 matching structures, of which
one was a tetramer, five were dimers, and the rest were monomers; the C-terminal region had
13 matching structures, all dimers.
ORF9b is a lipid-binding protein thought to interact with mitochondrial proteins, thereby
suppressing interferon-driven innate immunity responses (43). ORF9b matched two structures
that showed binding to a lipid analog (44).
ORF9c (a.k.a. ORF14) is currently uncharacterized experimentally; it is predicted to have a
single-pass transmembrane helix. ORF9c had no matching structures.
ORF10 is a predicted protein that currently has limited evidence of translation (45), has no
reported similarity to other coronavirus proteins, and has no matching structures.

Discussion
The 872 models derived in this study capture essentially all structural states of SARS-CoV-2
proteins with supporting experimental evidence. We used these states to create a structural

3D structure of the viral proteome. Remarkably, we found so few states showing viral
self-assembly (Fig. 5), mimicry (Fig. 3), or hijacking (Fig. 4) that — excluding non-human host
proteins — all states could be included in the coverage map via several simple graphs. This
may indicate that host interactions are rarely used in COVID-19 infection, consistent with the
notion that viral activity is largely shielded from the host. However, other experimental
techniques have found many more interactions between viral proteins (46), and with host
proteins (45). Thus, the small number of interactions found in this work likely indicates
limitations in current structural data.
Using the current structural data (Fig. 2), we can divide the 27 SARS-CoV-2 proteins into four
categories: mimics, hijackers, teams, and suspects — below, we highlight insights derived in
this work for each of these categories.

Mimics
We found structural evidence for mimicry of human proteins for only two SARS-CoV-2 proteins:
NSP3 and NSP13 (Figs. 2 & 3; Table S6).
NSP3 may mimic host proteins containing macro domains, interfering with ADP-ribose (ADPr)
modification and thereby suppressing host innate immunity (22). We found nine potentially
mimicked proteins (Fig. 3A); the top ranked matches (MACROD2 and MACROD1) remove
ADPr from proteins (47), reversing the effect of ADPr writers (e.g., PARP9, PARP14, and
PARP15 in lymphoid tissues), and affecting ADPr readers (e.g., the core histone proteins
MACROH2A1, and MACROH2A2, found in most cells). Thus we speculate that, in infected
cells, ADPr erasure by NSP3 may influence epigenetic regulation of chromatin state (48),
potentially contributing to variation in COVID-19 patient outcomes. Furthermore, in infected
macrophages, activation by PARP9 and PARP14 may be undermined by NSP3’s erasure of
ADPr, resulting in vascular disorders (49), as seen in COVID-19 (50).
NSP13 may mimic four human helicases, based on stronger alignment evidence than for
mimicry by NSP3 (Fig. 3). Three of these helicases are associated with DNA repair and
recombination, thus we speculate mimicry of these proteins could either recruit host proteins to
assist in viral recombination (51), or alternatively, could dysregulate recombination of host DNA.
However, we found no evidence for mimicry of the ~100 other human helicases (52), many also
involved in recombination, suggesting that mimicry may hijack more specific functions
performed by the four helicases. The top ranked helicase was IGHMBP2 (a.k.a. SMBP2), which
acts in the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus, where it interacts with single-stranded DNA in the
class switching region of the genome (53), close to ​IGMH​, the gene coding the constant region
of immunoglobulin heavy chains. We speculate that mimicry of IGHMBP2 may explain the
dysregulation of immunoglobulin-class switching observed clinically (54). The second ranked
helicase was UPF1 (a.k.a. regulator of nonsense transcripts 1, or RENT1), which acts in the
cytoplasm as part of the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway, known to counteract
coronavirus infection (55); we speculate that mimicry of UPF1 may hijack this pathway, thus
impeding host defenses. UPF1 also acts in the nucleus, interacting with telomeres — as does
the helicase PIF1; we speculate that mimicry of UPF1 or PIF1 may be implicated to the
connection seen between COVID-19 severity, age, and telomere length (56). In summary, we
propose that (as mentioned above for nucleocapsid protein) NSP13 may sometimes switch from

its key role in viral replication to a state focused on host genome interactions that undermine
host immunity.

Hijackers
We found direct structural evidence for hijacking of human proteins for only two SARS-CoV-2
proteins: NSP3 and spike glycoprotein (Figs. 2 & 4; Table S6).
NSP3 is believed to cleave ubiquitin from host proteins, thereby suppressing innate immune
response and disrupting proteasome-mediated degradation (22). We found six structures
showing NSP3 PL-Pro bound to ubiquitin domains from UBB, UBC, or UBA52 (a.k.a.
ubiquitin-60S ribosomal protein L40). Four additional structures showed binding to the
ubiquitin-like domains of ISG15 (a.k.a. interferon stimulated gene 15), which attaches to newly
synthesized proteins; ISGylation does not induce degradation but likely disturbs virion assembly
(22). Together, these 10 structures show in detail how NSP3 reverses either ubiquitination or
ISGylation (Fig. 4B); a further two structures show how NSP3 may be blocked with inhibitors
(Fig. 2).
Spike glycoprotein is known to bind receptors on the host cell membrane, thereby initiating
membrane fusion and viral entry (33). We found 16 matching structures showing hijacking of
ACE2, a carboxypeptidase that cleaves vasoactive peptides. One of these structures also
shows binding to SLC6A19 (a.k.a. B​0​AT1), an amino acid transporter reported to act with ACE2
(57). Most structures show only short fragments of this protein; however, by consolidating
several structures and sequence features, we created an integrated view showing the cellular
context of the pre-fusion event, when spike first binds the ACE + SLC6A19 complex (Fig. 4B).
Three further matching structures showed interactions between spike and host membrane
receptor DPP4 (a.k.a. CD26), an aminopeptidase that SARS-CoV-2 may use to enter host
immune cells (58). If so, DPP4 and ACE2 may interact with spike at distinct but overlapping
binding sites (Fig. 4B) that may be useful as therapeutic targets. Some reports suggest that,
although DPP4 may not be involved (59), SARS-CoV-2 directly infects some immune cells (60);
if so, it may switch to a non-reproductive mode, leading to immune dysregulation (61) and
apoptosis — as reported for SARS-CoV (62) and MERS-CoV (63) — thereby contributing to
lymphopenia (64) and necrosis of lymphoid tissue (65) seen in severe COVID-19. We speculate
that this cell-type-dependent state switching may be driven by NSP3 modifications of either ADP
ribosylation, ubiquitination, or ISGlyation, and may involve the state switches noted above for
NSP13 and nucleocapsid protein.

Teams
We found structural evidence for interaction between only six SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Figs. 2 &
5); they divided into two distinct teams, each with three proteins.
Team 1 comprised NSP7, NSP8, and NSP12, all members of the viral RNA replication complex
(Fig. 5A). NSP12 alone can replicate RNA, as can NSP7 + NSP8 acting together (25). However,
replication is greatly stimulated by cooperative interactions between these proteins (66). Most
combinations of these proteins were seen amongst the 60 matching structures found (Fig. 5A),
although all models for NSP12 alone or with RNA derived from very remote viruses (e.g.,
enterovirus). The matrix of combinations (Fig. 5A) gives insight into how the complex may
assemble, and shows that several proteins that may be involved in genome replication (29) are

missing (NSP3, NSP9, NSP10, NSP13, NSP14, and NSP16). These outcomes demonstrate the
value of modelling all available structural states, rather than only one or few states per protein.
Team 2 comprised NSP10, NSP14, and NSP16 (Fig. 5B). All matching structures found for
NSP14 and NSP16 showed binding with NSP10, consistent with the belief that NSP10 is
required for NSP16 RNA-cap methyltransferase activity (67), and also for NSP14
methyltransferase and exoribonuclease activities (68). In addition, NSP10 was found to form a
homododecamer; however, these three oligomeric states of NSP10 share a common binding
region (69) (Fig. 5B). This suggests NSP10, NSP14, and NSP16 interact competitively — in
contrast to cooperative interactions seen in team 1. We speculate that NSP10 is produced at
higher abundance than NSP14 or NSP16, or may be rate limiting for viral replication.
Finally, it is noteworthy that no interactions were found between the 12 virion or accessory
proteins (Fig. 1, bottom third). This, again, highlights limitations in currently available structural
data.

Suspects
This leaves 18 of the 27 viral proteins in a final category we call suspects: these are proteins
thought to play key roles in infection, but having no structural evidence of interaction with RNA,
DNA, or other proteins (viral or human). We divided the suspects into two groups, based on
matching structures.
Group 1 proteins were those with at least one matching structure: NSP1, NSP2, NSP4, NSP9,
NSP15, E, ORF7a, and ORF9a. Some of these have been well studied (e.g., NSP5 had 256
matching structures). Yet none of these proteins had significant similarity to any experimentally
determined 3D structure involving human proteins, or to any structure showing interactions
between viral proteins — based on the methods used in this work.
Group 2 proteins were those with no matching structures: NSP6, ORF3a, matrix glycoprotein,
ORF6, ORF8, and ORF9c, and ORF10. As noted previously, NSP2 could, arguably, be included
in this group. These are structurally dark proteins (13), meaning not only is their structure
unknown, but also that they have no significant sequence similarity to any experimentally
determined 3D structure — based on the methods used in this work. These proteins are ripe
candidates for advanced modelling strategies, e.g., using predicted residue contacts combined
with deep learning (3).

Conclusions
We have assembled a wealth of structural data, not available elsewhere, about the viral
proteome. We used these data to construct a structural coverage map summarizing what is
known — and not known — about the 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The coverage map
also summarizes structural evidence for viral protein interaction teams and for mimicry and
hijacking of host proteins — and identifies suspect viral proteins, with no evidence of
interactions to other macromolecules. The map can be used by researchers to help find 3D
models of interest, which can then be mapped with a large set of sequence features to provide
insights into protein function. The resulting Aquaria-COVID resource (​https://aquaria.ws/covid​)
aims to fulfil a vital role during the COVID-19 pandemic, helping scientists use emerging
structural data to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying coronavirus infection.

Based on insights gained using our resource, we propose mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2
may sense the type of cells it infects (via posttranslational modifications by NSP3) and, in
certain cells, may switch focus from viral reproduction to disruption of host immunity (via
hijacking by NSP13). Our resource lets researchers easily explore and assess the evidence for
these mechanisms — or for others they may propose themselves — thereby helping direct
future research.

Materials and Methods
SARS-CoV-2 Sequences
This study was based on the 14 protein sequences provided in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot version
2020_03 (released April 22, 2020; ​https://www.uniprot.org/statistics/​) as comprising the
SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Swiss-Prot provides polyproteins 1a and 1ab (a.k.a. PP1a and PP1ab)
as two separate entries, both identical for the first 4401 residues; PP1a then has four additional
residues (‘GFAV’) not in PP1ab, which has 2695 additional residues not in PP1a. Swiss-Prot
also indicates residue positions at which the polyproteins become cleaved into protein
fragments, named NSP1 though NSP16. The NSP11 fragment comprises the last 13 residues
of PP1a (4393–4405). The first 9 residues of NSP12 are identical to the first nine of NSP11, but
the rest of that 919 residue long protein continues with a different sequence due to a functionally
important frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b (70). Thus, following cleavage, the proteome
comprises a final total of 27 separate proteins.

Sequence-to-Structure Alignments
The 14 SARS-CoV-2 sequences were then systematically compared with sequences derived
from all known 3D structures from all organisms, based on PDB released on May 30, 2020.
These comparisons used the latest version of HHblits (8) — an alignment method employing
iterative comparisons of hidden Markov models (HMMs) — and using the processing pipeline
defined previously (9), accepting all sequence-to-structure alignments with a significance
threshold of E ≤ 10​-10​. The result is a database of protein sequence-to-structure homologies
called PSSH2, which is used in the Aquaria web resource (9).
HHblits has been substantially updated since we last assessed the specificity and sensitivity of
PSSH2 (9), therefore we repeated our assessment of resulting alignments, this time using
CATH (16) for the determination of accuracy and precision. Our test data set comprised 23,028
sequences from the CATH nr40 data set. We built individual sequence profiles against
UniClust30 and used these profiles to search against “PDB_full”, a database of HMMs for all
PDB sequences. We then evaluated how many false positives were retrieved at an E-value
lower than 10​-10​, where a false positive was seen to be a structure with a different CATH code at
the level of homologous superfamily (H) or topology (T). We compared the ratio of false
positives received with HH-suite3 and UniClust30 with a similar analysis for data produced in
2017 with HH-suite2 and UniProt20, and found that in both cases the false positive rate was at
2.5% at the homology level (H), and 1.9% at the topology level (T). The recovery rate, i.e. the
ratio of proteins from the CATH nr40 data (with less than 40% sequence identity) found by our

method that have the same CATH code, was slightly higher with HH-suite3 (8) (20.8% vs.
19.4%).
For each sequence-to-structure alignment derived from HHblits, the Aquaria interface shows the
pairwise sequence identity score, thus providing an intuitive indication of how closely related the
given region of SARS-CoV-2 is to the sequence of the matched structure. However, to more
accurately assess the quality of the match, Aquaria also gives an E-value, calculated by
comparing two HMMs, one generated for each of these two sequences.

PredictProtein Features
To facilitate analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences, we enhanced the Aquaria resource to include
PredictProtein features (18), thus providing a very rich set of predicted features for all
Swiss-Protein sequences. The four PredictProtein feature sets used in this work were fetched
via:
https://api.predictprotein.org/v1/results/molart/:uniprot_id

Conservation. The first PredictProtein feature set is generated by ConSurf (71) and gives, for
each residue, a score between 1 and 9, corresponding to very low and very high conservation,
respectively. These scores estimate the evolutionary rate in protein families, based on
evolutionary relatedness between the query protein and its homologues from UniProt using
empirical Bayesian methods (72).
Disorder. This feature set gives consensus predictions generated by Meta-Disorder (73), which
combines outputs of several structure-based disorder predictors to classify each residue as
either disordered or not disordered.
Flexibility. This feature set predicts, for each residue, normalized B-factor values ​expected to be
observed in an X-ray-derived structure, generated by PROFbval (73). For each residue,
PROFbval provides a score between 0 and 100; a score of 50 indicates average flexibility, while
≥71 indicates highly flexible residues.
Topology. This feature set is generated by TMSEG (74), a machine learning model that uses
evolutionary-derived information to predict regions of a protein that traverse membranes, as well
as the subcellular locations of complementary (non-transmembrane) regions.

SNAP2 Features
We further enhanced Aquaria to include SNAP2 (17) features, which provide information on the
mutational propensities for each residue position. In Aquaria, two SNAP2 features sets are
fetched via:
https://rostlab.org/services/aquaria/snap4aquaria/json.php?uniprotAcc=:uniprot_id

Mutational Sensitivity. T
​ he first SNAP2 feature set provides, for each residue position, a list of
20 scores that indicate the predicted functional consequences of the position being occupied by
each of the 20 standard amino acids. Large, positive scores (up to 100) indicate substitutions
likely to have deleterious changes, while negative scores (down to -100) indicate no likely
functional change. From these 20 values, a single summary score is calculated based on the
total fraction of substitutions predicted to have deleterious effect, taken to be those with a score
14

> 40. The summary scores are used to generate a red to blue color map, indicating residues
with highest to least functional importance, respectively.
Mutational Score. ​The second SNAP2 feature set is based on the same 20 scores above, but
calculates the single summary score for each residue as the average of the individual scores for
each of the 20 standard amino acids.

UniProt Features
UniProt features are curated annotations, and therefore largely complement the automatically
generated PredictProtein features. In Aquaria, for each protein sequence, the UniProt feature
collection is fetched via:
https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/:uniprot_id.xml

CATH Features
For this work, we further enhanced Aquaria to include CATH domain annotations (16). For most
protein sequences, Aquaria fetches two CATH feature sets via APIs given at:
https://github.com/UCLOrengoGroup/cath-api-docs

For SARS-CoV-2 proteins, however, CATH annotations are not yet fully available via the above
APIs. In this work, we used a pre-release version of these annotations, derived by scanning the
UniProt pre-release sequences against the CATH-Gene3D v4.3 FunFams HMM library (75)​.
Domain assignments were obtained using cath-resolve-hits and curated manually (75). For the
SARS-CoV-2 sequences, Aquaria fetches two CATH feature sets via:
https://aquaria.ws/covid19cath/P0DTC2

Superfamilies. The first CATH feature set identifies regions of protein sequences across a wide
variety of organisms that are expected to have very similar 3D structures and to have general
biological functions in common.
Functional Families. ​Also known as FunFams, this feature set partitions each superfamily into
subsets expected to have more specific biological functions in common (75).
When examining a specific superfamily or functional family domain in Aquaria, the browser uses
additional CATH API endpoints (via the link above) to create compact, interactive data
visualizations that give access to detailed information on the biological function and
phylogenetic distribution of proteins containing that domain.

Average Feature Scores
In the results, we include average scores for some of the above feature sets. The average
scores given for NSP3 regions were calculated using features provided for the PP1a sequence;
however, the average whole-protein scores given for each of the 15 PP1ab proteins were
calculated using features provided for the PP1ab sequence.

Aquaria Core
For this work, the Aquaria core codebase has been substantially refactored. We changed all
client-server data exchanges to use get requests, instead of sockets as used previously (9).
This allowed us to further implement both server- and client-side caching, resulting in greatly
improved performance. Another major change was to the user interface, where we removed the

previously used Java applet (9), and replaced it with Jolecule, a JavaScript-based molecular
graphics component (​https://jolecule.com/​), that we further augmented to enable feature
mapping. In this work, Jolecule was used to determine the set of residues comprising
intermolecular contacts by selecting all residues for one protein, then applying Jolecule’s
‘Neighbours’ function. This highlights all residues in which any atom is within 5 Å.

Structure Coverage Matrix
We created a web page featuring a matrix view of the 14 UniProt sequence, and showing the
total number of matching structures found. This page allows navigation to the corresponding
Aquaria page for each protein sequence, from where all matching structures can be seen and
mapped with sequence features.

Structural Coverage Map
We created an additional web page using a layout derived from the organization of the viral
genome. For each contiguous region of the viral proteome that had matching structures, we
selected a single representative structure (Fig. 2), primarily based on identity to the
SARS-CoV-2 sequence. However, in some cases, representatives were chosen that best
illustrated the consensus biological assembly seen across all matching structures, or showed
the simplest assembly. Under the name of each viral protein, the total number of matching
structures found in PSSH2 (9) is indicated. Below each structure, a tree graph is drawn where
there is structural evidence of mimicry (i.e., where the viral sequence aligns onto human
proteins), hijacking (i.e., where the matching structures show binding between viral and human
proteins, or with DNA, RNA, antibodies, or inhibitory factors), or physical interaction with other
viral proteins. When these tree graphs are missing, none of the matching structures meet these
criteria.

Figures

Fig. 1. Graphical elements of the structural coverage map
The ruler (top) indicates sequence residue numbering. Dark sequence regions indicate either alignment gaps, or
regions that do not match any experimentally-determined 3D structure. Regions with matching structure are
indicated in green, and with a representative 3D structure position below, using dark gray coloring to indicate
amino acid substitutions, using light gray to indicate alignment insertions, and using secondary structure coloring
to indicate identical residues in the alignment. The coloring scheme makes it clear that the NSP1 model is similar in
sequence to SARS-CoV-2, while the NSP2 model is remote. However, a better measure of model significance is the
HHblits E-value, calculated by aligning sequence profiles for SARS-CoV-2 onto profiles for each 3D structure. The
NSP2 model is more significant as it has a longer alignment.

Fig. 2. SARS-CoV-2 structural coverage map
Integrated visual summary of 3D structural evidence about viral protein states. Proteins are shown as arrows,
scaled by sequence length, ordered by genomic location, and divided into three groups: (1) polyprotein 1a (top);
(2) polyprotein 1b (middle); and (3) virion and accessory proteins (bottom). Dark coloring indicates sequence
regions that do not match any experimentally-determined 3D structure. Regions with matching structure are
indicated in green, and with representative 3D structures positioned below (Fig. 1), all at about the same physical
scale. NSP3 (macro domain) and NSP13 may mimic the human proteins shown as orange nodes connected by solid
lines (Fig. 3). NSP3 (PL-Pro domain) and spike glycoprotein may hijack the human proteins shown as gray nodes
connected by dotted lines (Fig. 4). Interactions between viral proteins are shown using green colored nodes
connected by dotted lines; these interactions occur in two disjoint teams: (1) NSP7, NSP8, and NSP12; and (2)
NSP10, NSP14, and NSP16. For the remaining 18 viral proteins (‘suspects’), there was no structural evidence for
interactions with other viral proteins, or for mimicry or hijacking of human proteins. Seven of the 18 are
structurally dark proteins: NSP6, ORF3a, matrix glycoprotein, ORF6, ORF8, ORF9c, and ORF10. Details on the
models found for each protein are presented in the Results, and in Table S5.

Fig. 3. Viral mimicry of human proteins
(A) Lists domain topology for nine human proteins potentially mimicked by NSP3 (macro domain). The list was ranked by alignment
significance, and includes a summary of potentially mimicked functions. Each macro domain is numbered to indicate its CATH functional family.
The top ranked proteins (MACROD2 and MACROD1) remove ADPr from proteins, reversing the effect of ADPr writers (PARP14, PARP15, and
PARP9), and affecting ADPr readers (GDAP2, MACROH2A2, and MACROH2A1).
(B) Lists four human helicase proteins potentially mimicked by NSP13. The list was ranked by alignment significance, and includes a summary
of potentially mimicked functions. There is stronger evidence (i.e., lower E value) for mimicry by NSP13 than by NSP3. For the two top ranked
proteins, we show 3D structures of the human proteins, colored to indicate the region of alignment (Fig. 1) to NSP13. For IGHMBP2
(​P0DTD1/4b3g​), we see that RNA binds to the region matched by NSP13, suggesting that NSP13 binds RNA. For UPF1 (​P0DTD1/2wjv​), we see
that UPF2 binds to a region not matched by NSP13, suggesting that NSP13 does not bind UPF2. For AQR and PIF1, we show a structure of NSP13
(​P0DTD1/6jyt​), colored to indicate regions matching AQR and PIF1.

Fig. 4​. ​Viral hijacking of human proteins

(A) NSP3 (PL-Pro region) has three domains (yellow,
green, and blue) that form two binding sites for
ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domains (gray). In most matching
structures, a single Ubl domain occupies the primary
binding site (dark gray), with its C-terminal LRLRGG motif
(red) positioned between the PL-Pro thumb and palm
domains, and ending at the proteolytic cleavage site (red).
The LRLRGG motif can attach to other proteins, including
other copies of ubiquitin. PL-Pro cleaves this attachment,
reversing mono- or poly-ubiquitination. One matching
structure showed binding of two ubiquitin domains (UBB
and UBC), with UBB occupying the secondary site (light
gray). Other structures showed binding to the N- and
C-terminal Ubl domains of ISG15 (interferon stimulated
gene 15) at the secondary and primary sites, respectively.
(B) The spike trimer structure (top left; ​P0DTC2/6acg​)
shows the pre-fusion state after cleavage at the S1/S2
boundary, and with one S1-CTD domain (green) bound to
the extracellular region of the carboxypeptidase ACE2
(purple). Below that, we have manually aligned a second
structure (​P0DTC2/6m17​) showing S1-CTD in complex with
ACE2 and the amino acid transporter SLC6A19. By
integrating sequence features (top and bottom) with 3D
structures, the resulting figure shows the cellular context
of the pre-fusion event, when spike first binds the
ACE​ + ​SLC6A19 complex. The insert highlights S1-CTD
residues that contact ACE2 (magenta). These are
compared to residues that contact the N-terminal
dipeptide peptidase DPP4 in a structure from BtCoV-HKU4
(​P0DTC2/4qzv​). DPP4 may also be targeted by SARS-CoV-2
(76)​; if so, our analysis shows that the S1-CTD​ + ​DPP4
binding site may partly overlap the S1-CTD​ + ​ACE2 binding
site.

Fig. 5. Viral protein
interactions
(A) Summarizes all structural
states observed for NSP7 (red),
NSP8 (blue), and NSP12 (yellow).
NSP12 alone (top row, left) can
replicate RNA (top row, right);
however, all matching structures
were from distantly related viruses
(pairwise identity ≤ 18%), such as
EV71 (enterovirus). NSP8 binds
NSP12 at two sites: (1) at the
NSP12 core (2nd row, left); and (2)
via NSP7-mediated cooperative
interactions
at
the
NSP12
periphery (bottom row, center),
greatly enhancing RNA replication
(bottom
row,
right).
By
themselves, NSP7 + NSP8 (bottom
row, left) can also replicate RNA
(25). Six of the matching structures
showed NSP7 + NSP8 as a dimer;
however, one structure showed a
tetramer and one other showed a
hexadecamer (​P0DTD1/3ub0 and
P0DTD1/2ahm​, respectively).
(B) Summarizes all structural
states observed for NSP10, NSP14,
and NSP16 (Team 2). One
matching structure showed an
NSP10 monomer (top), while two
structures showed NSP10 as a
dodecamer (bottom, left). All
structures
matching
NSP14
showed a heterodimer with NSP10
(bottom, middle). All structures
matching NSP16 showed a
heterodimer with NSP10 (bottom,
right). Nine NSP10 residues (shown
in red on the monomer) were
common intermolecular contacts
in all three oligomers. Each
oligomer also had specific NSP10
contacts (blue); but most NSP10
contacts were shared with at least
one other oligomer (shown in red
on each oligomer). This suggests
that NSP10, NSP14, and NSP16
interact competitively.
