Abstract:

42

The spike (S) glycoprotein in the envelope of SARS-CoV-2 is densely glycosylated but the

43

functions of its glycosylation are unknown. Here we demonstrate that S is recognized in a

44

glycan-dependent manner by multiple innate immune receptors including the mannose

45

receptor MR/CD206, DC-SIGN/CD209, L-SIGN/CD209L, and MGL/CLEC10A/CD301.

46

Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses indicate that such receptors are highly expressed in

47

innate immune cells in tissues susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Binding of the above

48

receptors to S is characterized by affinities in the picomolar range and consistent with S

49

glycosylation analysis demonstrating a variety of N- and O-glycans as receptor ligands.

50

These results indicate multiple routes for SARS-CoV-2 to interact with human cells and

51

suggest alternative strategies for therapeutic intervention.

Introduction:

54

SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense RNA enveloped virus characterized by a surface Spike (S)

55

glycoprotein1. During host cell invasion, S binds to receptors on cell membranes, such as

56

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)1, 2, 3. However, the nature and function of the S

57

glycosylation is not fully understood.

58

Densely glycosylated with multiple Asn-linked (N-glycans) and a few Ser/Thr-linked (O-

59

glycans)4, 5, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 potentially presents ligands for a variety of innate

60

immune receptors, including C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), that are known to bind specific

61

glycans mostly in a Ca2+-dependent manner6, 7. CLRs such as DC-SIGN/CD209, L-

62

SIGN/CD209L/CLEC4M, mannose receptor/MR/MRC1/CD206, MGL/CLEC10A/CD301,

63

and Dectin-2/CLEC6A, are highly expressed within the human immune system including

64

monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages, functioning as the first-line of defense against

65

invading viruses and pathogens8, 9. As known pattern-recognition receptors, CLRs, especially

66

DC-SIGN, can direct host immune responses against numerous pathogens in a glycan-

67

specific manner by modulating Toll-like receptor-induced activation 10.

68

Evidence implicates innate immune cells in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Over 80% of

69

patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection present with lymphopenia and an increased neutrophil-

70

lymphocyte ratio11. Patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit hyperactive macrophages in the

71

bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and oropharyngeal swab12. Likewise, increased

72

infiltration and activation of macrophages is observed in biopsy or autopsy specimens from

73

COVID-19 patients13. Previous studies of the closely-related SARS-CoV demonstrated that

74

primary human monocytes and dendritic cells can be infected14, 15, and SARS-CoV S can

75

bind DC-SIGN and L-SIGN16, 17, 18, 19. Eight glycosylation sites of SARS-CoV S were

76

identified to be involved in their interactions20, 21, among which six are conserved in SARS-

77

CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig. 1). However, it is not known whether SARS-CoV-2 interacts

78

with a variety of CLRs.

79

Here, we demonstrate that many different CLRs directly bind in a glycan-dependent manner

80

to the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 with picomolar affinities. Binding of DC-SIGN can

81

trigger the internalization of S in 3T3-DC-SIGN+ cells, which implies the potential

82

involvement in viral entry. Furthermore, we dissect the N- and O-glycan sequences on the

83

recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S, and identify glycan features that are crucial for interactions

84

with these CLRs. The analyses of open accessible single-cell RNA sequencing data confirm

85

that various human tissues and their resident immune cells differentially express CLRs,

86

including MR, MGL and DC-SIGN in bronchoalveolar macrophages in patients with SARS-

87

CoV-2. This is in direct contrast to the absence of ACE2 expression within the same cell

88

types across the tissues. Our study identifies new SARS-CoV-2 binding receptors expressed

89

on innate immune cells, particularly on macrophages and dendritic cells, which could

90

accentuate severe pathological inflammation along with cytokine release syndrome. The

91

results suggest potential additional routes for viral infection and new anti-viral strategies.

92
93

Results:

94

Multiple CLRs bind SARS-CoV-2 S in a glycan-dependent manner

95

Multiple CLRs including DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, MR (C-type lectin domains 4-7) and MGL

96

exhibited strong binding to the recombinant full-length S produced in human embryonic

97

kidney HEK293 cells (Fig. 1a-c & e). HEK293 cells are known to present a spectrum of

98

human glycosylation reflective of the kidney and other epithelial tissues22. DC-SIGN, L-

99

SIGN and MGL also bound to recombinant S1, the subunit involved in ACE2 recognition. By

100

contrast, another CLR, Dectin-2, did not bind S or S1, but bound the positive control, a yeast

101

extract (EBY-100) containing mannan-type ligands (Fig. 1d). Binding of DC-SIGN, L-SIGN,

102

MR and MGL was glycan-dependent, as it was sensitive to treatment with sequence-specific

103

glycosidases (Fig. 1f). Binding of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN was attenuated by Endoglycosidase

104

H (Endo H, oligomannose and hybrid type N-glycan-targeting) and eliminated by PNGase F

105

(N-glycan-targeting), suggesting that the two CLRs bind to S via both oligomannose and

106

complex N-glycans. MR binding was abolished by both Endo H and PNGase F (Fig. 1c),

107

suggesting that oligomannose N-glycans are the ligands. A profound reduction in MGL

108

binding was observed by exposure to PNGase F, indicating that MGL ligands reside

109

primarily on N-glycans. Sialic acid appeared to mask some of the MGL ligands as

110

neuraminidase (Neu) treatment slightly increased the binding (Fig. 1e), which was similar to

111

the effect on bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) with abundant O-glycans comprised of

112

sialylated N-acetylgalactosamine (STn antigen). The effects of glycosidase treatment were

113

confirmed by loss or gain of binding by glycan-binding lectins GNA, ConA and VVA

114

(Supplementary Fig. 2a, b & d). Interestingly, neither DC-SIGN nor L-SIGN bound

115

recombinant S2 (Supplementary Fig. 2e-h), the subunit mediating cell fusion. In all cases

116

CLR binding to S and S1 was Ca2+-dependent as expected (Supplementary Fig. 2i-l).

117

Taken together, our results demonstrate that DC-SIGN and L-SIGN bind the recombinant S

118

via high-mannose and complex N-glycans, while MR recognizes S via its high-mannose

119

moieties only. MGL binding can be largely attributed to N-glycans, but O-glycans could also

120

be partly involved in its recognition.

121
122

CLRs interact with the SARS-CoV-2 S with high affinity

123

Earlier study showed DC-SIGN and MGL at 1 µg/ml can bind the recombinant receptor

124

binding domain (RBD) of S by ELISA assay23. Here, using a native-like trimeric SARS-

125

CoV-2 S protein, we sought to measure the binding affinities of DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, MR and

126

MGL, and the canonical SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2. The results indicate that the

127

CLRs and ACE2 all bind S in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1g-k). While ACE2 showed the

128

highest affinity with Kd = 4 pM, binding of DC-SIGN, MGL and MR was strong, with Kd =

129

192, 312 and 317 pM, respectively. L-SIGN showed moderate affinity with Kd = 986 pM.

130
131

SARS-CoV-2 S glycoforms mediate interactions with CLRs

132

To directly characterize the nature of S glycans that interact with these CLRs, we performed

133

in-depth N-glycan and O-glycopeptide analyses (Fig. 2). A similar set of N-glycans,

134

including oligomannose- and complex-type, was detected in the recombinant full-length S,

135

the S1 and S2, but the relative abundance of each individual glycan varies between samples

136

(Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 1). Oligomannose N-glycans were mainly

137

detected in the full-length S, with the major component being Man5GlcNAc2, serving

138

potential ligand for DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, and MR24, 25. Major epitopes on the complex N-

139

glycans were revealed by MALDI-TOF-MS/MS analysis (Supplementary Fig. 4). Most

140

complex N-glycans contained core Fuc, and a large proportion were neutral and terminated

141

with either GlcNAc or LacNAc (Gal-GlcNAc) (Fig. 2). Notably, our N-glycan microarray

142

analysis revealed that although certain GlcNAc-terminating N-glycans can be bound by DC-

143

SIGN and L-SIGN, the binding was greatly attenuated by the presence of core Fuc (#5 and #7

144

vs #1 and #3, Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 2). Thus, they are unlikely

145

to be the binding partners of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN. Moreover, MS/MS confirmed the

146

presence of Lewis A/X and LacdiNAc epitopes (GalNAc-GlcNAc) (Supplementary Fig. 4a

147

& b). The former was relatively high in the full-length S and the S1, potentially serving as

148

ligands of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN26, 27. The latter was particularly abundant in S1 and S2,

149

potentially supporting the binding of MGL28. The higher molecular-weight region is

150

dominated by multi-antennary N-glycans with various degrees of sialylation

151

(Supplementary Fig. 3), which are not known ligands for those CLRs.

152

In an O-glycopeptide-centered analysis of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S, we identified four

153

new O-glycosylation sites (Tyr28-Arg34, Thr678, Ser 686 and Thr1160) in addition to the

154

previous reported site (Thr323) in the RBD4, 5 (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 6 and

155

Supplementary Table 3). All sites except Thr323 were partially occupied. Major glycan

156

epitopes identified on these sites include non-, mono- and disialylated core 1 (Galβ1-

157

3GalNAc-R) and core 2 [GlcNAcβ1-6(Galβ1-3)GalNAc-R]. Importantly, Tn antigen

158

(GalNAc), which is a binding determinant for MGL, was only partially present on Thr323.

159

This is in line with our conclusion that MGL mainly binds N-glycans.

160

Among the four newly discovered O-glycosylation sites, two reside in the furin cleavage site

161

between S1/S2 (Thr678 and Ser686) which are unique to SARS-CoV-2. Although there has

162

not yet been evidence that O-glycosylation plays a role in protease cleavage of S1, 29, further

163

investigation is warranted as O-glycosylation does affect protease susceptibility in other

164

systems, as well as antibody recognition30, 31.

165

In summary, our glycomics, glycoproteomics analyses, and glycan microarray analysis

166

confirmed that the glycans on SARS-CoV-2 S could serve as ligands for DC-SIGN, L-SIGN,

167

MR and MGL.

168
169

DC-SIGN and L-SIGN on the cell surface bind SARS-CoV-2 S resulting in its

170

internalization

171

In order to investigate whether S interacts with the CLRs expressed on cell surfaces, we

172

performed flow cytometry using transduced fibroblast-derived 3T3 cells expressing DC-

173

SIGN and L-SIGN, although the latter had only a L-SIGN+ subpopulation (Supplementary

174

Fig. 7). The parental 3T3 cells lacked expression of DC-SIGN or L-SIGN. In accordance

175

with the western blot results, the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S trimer was strongly bound by

176

DC-SIGN+ cells (Fig. 3a & b) and to a lesser extent by L-SIGN+ cells (Fig. 3c & d). Ten

177

minutes after incubation, DC-SIGN+ cells presented signs of S internalization which was

178

significantly higher than the parental cells after 30 mins (Fig. 3e). Thus, our results indicate

179

that SARS-CoV-2 S can be recognized and captured by cells expressing these CLRs, which

180

can lead to internalization of the virus.

181
182

CLRs bind S produced by SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells

183

To further explore interactions of a native viral S protein with CLRs, we performed western

184

blot using lysates of SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells (Fig. 3f-j). Twenty-four hours post

185

infection, SARS-CoV-2 S can be robustly detected in the cell lysates by monoclonal antibody

186

1A9 (Fig. 3f), which binds the recombinant full-length S but not S1 of SARS-CoV-2

187

(Supplementary Fig. 7e). No band was detected in the virus-containing culture supernatant

188

(SN), even at a higher loading amounts (20×).

189

Among the CLRs, DC-SIGN and L-SIGN recognized a band with identical mobility to the

190

full-length S in the lysates of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (red arrow, Fig. 3g & h). This was

191

not present in the mock-infected cells. MR also exhibited positive binding in the SARS-CoV-

192

2-infected cells, and in addition, in the SN (red arrows, Fig 3i). By contrast, MGL, although

193

strongly bound to the recombinant S produced in HEK293 cells, did not appear to bind to S in

194

the Vero E6 cell lysates or in the SN (Fig. 3j). These results indicate that the glycosylation

195

status of S is influenced by the source of glycosylation, either in infected cells or the

196

recombinant expression system.

197

Taken together, our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero E6 cells produce S

198

protein which can be bound by DC-SIGN, L-SIGN and MR, suggesting that the virus could

199

be captured by host cells expressing these CLRs via their unique carbohydrate recognition.

200
201

CLRs are expressed on innate immune cells in tissues susceptible to SARS-CoV-2

202

infection

203

To characterize the distribution of DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, MR and MGL, we surveyed their

204

expression patterns together with ACE2 in multiple human tissues using public available

205

single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 8 & 9).

206

Consistent with previous results32, ACE2 expression was generally low in all analyzed

207

datasets, including human lung and upper airway, thymus, pancreas, spleen, ileum, liver and

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.29.227462; this version posted July 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

208

colon (Fig. 4a & b and Supplementary Fig. 8). In comparison, expression levels of MR and

209

MGL were higher, particularly in cells of the lung and upper airway (Fig. 4a). Their

210

expression was mainly restricted to resident immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic

211

cells, which was also the major cell types producing DC-SIGN, although to a lower extent. L-

212

SIGN was mainly expressed in endothelial cells in liver and pancreas, in lymphatic tissues in

213

ileum, as well as in immune cells, but at much lower levels (Fig. 4a & b and Supplementary

214

Fig. 8).

215

Emerging evidence showed a strong pathological inflammation in patients with COVID-19,

216

correlated with the presence of monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells33, 34. Therefore,

217

we examined the expression of DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, MR and MGL in available dataset of

218

BALF cells of healthy controls (HC), and patients with moderate (M) and severe (S) COVID-

219

19 (3, 6 and 3 cases, respectively, Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 9). Consistent with the

220

original report12, unbiased clustering identified over 30 distinct cell clusters, with the majority

221

of cells being macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 9a). Expression of ACE2 was mainly

222

restricted to epithelial cells of severe patients (Fig. 4c). In comparison, MR was

223

predominantly expressed in almost all macrophages and dendritic cells from the three donor

224

groups. Of note, the expression levels of DC-SIGN and MGL were increased in severe

225

COVID-19 patients with elevated amount of proinflammatory monocyte-derived

226

macrophages and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, TNF, CXCL10,

227

CXCL8, IL-1B, CCL2 and CCL3 (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 9). The resulting

228

increased systemic cytokine production from activated macrophages may contribute to the

229

pathophysiology of severe COVID-19.

230

Our analyses confirm the expression of CLRs and absence of ACE2 in bronchoalveolar and

231

other innate immune cells, indicating that DC-SIGN, MR and MGL might serve as

232

alternative receptors and entry routes in these cells for SARS-CoV-2.

233
234

Discussion:

235

Our results demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S can engage in a glycan-dependent manner

236

with multiple CLRs including DC-SIGN, L-SIGN, MR, and MGL, which are highly

237

expressed in innate immune cells and lymphoid organs, as confirmed by scRNA-seq analysis.

238

The observed interactions with picomolar affinities can initiate receptor-dependent

239

internalization of S as exemplified by DC-SIGN, and potentially provide routes for virus to

240

enter macrophages and dendritic cells. Our scRNA-seq analyses confirmed the co-expression

241

of the CLRs such as DC-SIGN, MR and MGL, and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines

242

in hyperactive macrophages and dendritic cells in patients with COVID-19. This is consistent

243

with the altered cytokine production in SARS-CoV-infected macrophages and dendritic cells,

244

albeit lack productive viral replication14, 15. Our results offer a possible explanation to how

245

SARS-CoV-2 spreads to extrapulmonary tissues within the host35, 36, 37, as the innate immune

246

cells lacking ACE2 expression can still interalize the virus via those CLRs.

247

Glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 S is obviously complex and dependent on the nature of the

248

protein and the glycosylation machinery of infected host cells. Our results indicate that

249

glycosylation potentially determines the immune receptors with which SARS-CoV-2 interact.

250

This variation may lead to virus clearance or on the contrary, results in spread of the virus to

251

other organs, or even other hosts. Interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with CLRs and subsequent

252

internalization suggests a possibility that resident innate immune cells in the lung may lessen

253

the available titer of free virus by endocytosis, thus slowing the onset of symptoms and

254

contributing to asymptomatic or presymptomatic patients38, 39. Notably, DC-SIGN and L-

255

SIGN can promote “trans” viral transmission, particularly exemplified in HIV-140. Early

256

studies confirmed that DC-SIGN and L-SIGN-expressing cells were able to transfer SARS-

257

CoV to susceptible target cells17, 18. Further research is warranted to explore whether this

258

could occur with SARS-CoV-2. A recent proteomics study discovered strong association

259

between the level of DC-SIGN and variants in the ABO locus, the glycosyltransferases

260

required for blood group synthesis, a known genetic risk factor for respiratory failure in

261

COVID-19 41. Given that SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia is detected, particularly in patients with

262

severe disease38, 42, it is tempting to speculate that subsequent to CLR-dependent

263

internalization, SARS-CoV-2 could be conveyed by CLR-expressing innate immune cells,

264

and redistributed to permissive tissues where more damage could occur43. In accord with this

265

hypothesis, a recent study revealed that SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid can be detected in

266

spleens and lymph nodes44.

267

The results here suggest several diagnostic and therapeutic directions. Inhibition of the CLRs

268

that bind virus or inhibition of the glycan-CLR interactions by small molecules might lessen

269

the distribution of virus in COVID-19 patients and potentially limit immune cell

270

(hyper)activation. Analysis of patients for polymorphisms in the genes encoding CLRs might

271

reveal associations with disease severity, as have been found for L-SIGN in SARS-CoV19.

272

Finally, defining the differences in glycosylation of S and the variant glycoforms might

273
274

provide insights into disease severity and spread of the virus in COVID-19 patients.

Fig. 2. Major N-glycans and O-glycopeptides identified in the recombinant full-length
SARS-CoV-2 S. Schematic representation of SARS-CoV-2 S shown in the middle. The
positions of N-glycosylation sites are shown on top. Protein domains in the illustration are:
N-terminal domain (NTD), receptor-binding domain (RBD), fusion peptide (FP), heptad
repeat 1 (HR1), central helix (CH), connector domain (CD), and transmembrane domain
(TM). The cleavage sites of S1/S2 and S2’ are labelled. Major N-glycan structures detected
by mass spectrometry were categorized by their epitopes on the non-reducing terminal and
shown on top. Cartoon symbols above a curly parenthesis indicates sequences corresponding
to these compositions cannot be unequivocally defined. The structures presented are only the
major glycans on the recombinant full-length S, S1, and S2. A full list of glycans can be
found in Supplementary Table 1. The O-glycopeptides detected in the full-length S protein
are presented at the bottom. The identified O-glycosylation sites are marked on the protein
and the O-glycans on each specific site are listed below each site. The LC-MS/MS spectrum
of each O-glycopeptide can be found in Supplementary Fig. 6. Labelled with asterisk were
those found only after neuraminidase treatment.

Methods:

489

Recombinant proteins

490

Recombinant S1 (His-tag), S2 (His-tag), full-length S protein (with mutations R683A and

491

R685A, His-tag), S protein trimer (with mutations R683A and R685A, His-tag), human

492

ACE2 (Fc-tag) were all purchased from Acrobiosystems (S1N-C52H3, S2N-C52H5, SPN-

493

C52H4, SPN-C52H8, AC2-H5257, respectively). The trimeric conformation of the full-

494

length S protein was validated by the vender using size exclusion chromatography under

495

detection with multi angle light scattering. Human DC-SIGN (Fc-tag), DC-SIGNR (Fc-tag),

496

MGL (Fc-tag) were purchased from Sino Biological (10200-H01H, 10559-H01H, 10821-

497

H01H, respectively). Anti-Spike protein antibody (1A9), which was a mouse monoclonal

498

antibody (IgG1) detecting the spike proteins of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through

499

S2 subunit, was purchased from GeneTex (GTX632604).

500

Human IgG Fc-tagged MR (MR-Fc), containing the murine C-type lectin domains 4-7 fused

501

to a human IgG Fc-portion, was produced in house. HEK293T cells were transfected with

502

MR-Fc DNA (kind gift from L. Martinez Pomares). Transfection was performed with

503

Lipofectamine LTX with Plus Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) conform with the

504

manufacturer´s guidelines. The cells were incubated with Lipofectamine complex at 37°C in

505

a CO2 incubator for 24 h, and the medium refreshed after 24 h. After 9 days the supernatant

506

containing the produced MR-Fc was collected and purified. MR-Fc was purified from cell

507

culture supernatant using Protein A-agarose beads (Roche). For ELISA experiments, the MR-

508

Fc was purified over mannan-agarose beads (Sigma) and protein A-agarose beads. MR-Fc

509

was quantified by Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at -20°C until further use.

(ATCC CRL-1586) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 50

519

units/ml penicillin, 50 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FBS. Infection studies were performed

520

in cell culture medium supplemented with 2% FBS.

521

The Saccharomyces strain EBY-100 was purchased from ATCC and cultured under the

522

recommended condition by the vendor. The EBY-100 cell extracts were prepared with the

523

lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, pH 7.6).

524

The protein concentration was quantified by Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher

525

Scientific).

526
527

Preparation of SARS-CoV-2

528

All work with infectious SARS-CoV-2, isolate USA_WA1/2020 was performed at the

529

National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories, Boston University under Biosafety

530

Level 4. Vero E6 cells seeded in 6-well plates were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at a

531

multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 or mock infected. After 1 h of virus adsorption at 37°C in

532

5% CO2, the inocula were removed and replaced with DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS.

533

Twenty-four hours post-infection, cell supernatants were removed, the cells were scraped and

534

pelleted by low-speed centrifugation. Cell pellets were washed once with PBS and

535

resuspended in 270 µl Cell Extraction Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A 900 µl aliquot of

536

a SARS-CoV-2 stock (Titer: 1.58 x107 TCID50 units/ml) was also used for analysis. Both the

537

cell lysates and the viral stock were inactivated by addition of SDS (1 % final concentration)

538

and boiling for 10 minutes prior to removal from the Biosafety Level 4 facility. The

539

inactivated cell lysates and virus stock were aliquoted and stored at -80°C until further use.

540

The protein concentration was quantified by Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher

541

Scientific).

542
543

Western Blot and Lectin Blot

544

The recombinant S, S1 and S2 proteins, together with controls were subject to enzymatic

545

digestion by PNGase F (P0708L, New England Biolabs), Endo H (P0702L, New England

546

Biolabs), neuraminidase (10269611001, Roche) or mock treatment before loading onto the

547

SDS-PAGE gel. The enzymatic digestion was following the protocols recommended by the

548

venders. Recombinant S, S1 and S2 protein and BSM were used at 1µg/lane, while the EBY-

549

100 extract was used at 15 µg/lane. The reaction mixture was directly loaded on the 4-20%

550

SDS-PAGE gel (GenScript) following addition of 4× laemmli loading buffer. The cell

551

extracts either from SARS-CoV-2 infected or mock infected Vero E6 cells (both at 50 µg

552

protein/lane), together with the culture supernatant (at 12 µg (2×) and 120 µg (20×)

553

protein/lane), were loaded on the SDS-PAGE gel following addition of 4× laemmli loading

554

buffer and 10 min heating. The gels were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or

555

Colloidal Blue (both from Thermo Fisher Scientific) to visualize the proteins, or transferred

556

to a PVDF membrane (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for Western blots.

557
558

The Western blot and lectin blot analysis were performed following the protocols published

559

previously46. The proteins were under the following concentrations: DC-SIGN, L-SIGN,

560

Dectin-2, MGL all at 1 µg/ml, MR at 2.5 µg/ml, biotinylated plant lectins GNA and VVA

561

both at 1 µg/ml, Con A at 0.1 µg/ml, or antibodies mAb100 at 1 µg/ml and anti-spike

562

antibody 1A9 at 0.5 µg/ml. The CLRs were prepared either in BSA-TTBS buffer [1% BSA in

563

20 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl2, 2 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4, with 0.05% Tween-20] or

564

BSA-TTBS-EDTA [1% BSA in 20 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) with

565

0.05% Tween-20 (TTBS)] to check the calcium dependence. HRP-labelled secondary

566

reagents including goat anti-human IgG-HRP, goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Jackson

567

ImmunoResearch Laboratories) or streptavidin-HRP (Vector Laboratories) are all used in

568

1:10,000 dilution.

569
570

ELISA

571

The ELISA assay was performed following the protocols published previously46. The S-

572

protein trimer was immobilized in a 96-well plate (0.2 µg/well) overnight at 4°C. The

573

proteins were serial diluted (1:2) and applied to each well. HRP-labeled goat anti-human IgG

574

was used at 1:1,000 dilution and the color development was with TMB ELISA Substrate

575

(Abcam, ab171523) The experiment was performed in duplicate and the background

576

subtraction was done by subtracting the corresponding binding signals obtained with BSA-

577

immobilized wells. Affinity constant was calculated with GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad

578

Software, Inc.).

579
580

Flow cytometry

581

For cell surface binding assay, the cultured 3T3, 3T3-DC-SIGN and 3T3-L-SIGN cells were

582

collected and washed with cold PBS once. The cells were incubated with full-length S protein

583

trimer (20 µg/ml) or the monoclonal antibody against DC-SIGN, #120507 (2 µg/ml) and L-

584

SIGN, #120604 (2 µg/ml), or buffer only (negative control) on ice for 30 minutes. Binding of

585

the full-length S protein was detected by mouse anti-His IgG (Invitrogen MA121315, 2

586

µg/ml) and Alexa Fluor-488-labelled goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen A11001, 1:500).

587

Binding of anti-DC-SIGN and anti-L-SIGN were detected directly with Alexa Fluor 488-

588

labelled goat anti-mouse IgG. The results shown were from three independent experiments

589

analyzed by FlowJo software.

590
591

Internalization assay

592

To measure internalization, the cells were suspended and incubated with S protein trimer on

593

ice as stated above. The cells were then centrifuged and fixed in 0.5% paraformaldehyde (T0)

594

in binding buffer or allowed for further incubation at 37 °C for 10 or 30 min (Tn) and ended

595

with 0.5% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were stained with mouse anti-His IgG and Alexa

596

Fluor-488-labelled goat anti-mouse IgG as indicated above for residual S trimer detection.

597

Internalization rate (%) was calculated by the formula: [gMFI of S trimer(T0)-gMFI of S

598

trimer (Tn)]/gMFI of S trimer (T0) × 100. The results shown were from five independent

599

experiments with comparable results.

600
601

Microarray analysis

602

Microarray analyses on the complex N-glycan array were conducted as reported previously47.

603

The microarray slides were probed with Fc-tagged DC-SIGN and L-SIGN at 10 µg/ml

604

diluted in 1% BSA (TSM with 0.05% Tween) and binding was detected with Alexa Fluor 488

605

labelled goat anti-human IgG (H+L) (Invitrogen) at 5 µg/ml.

606
607

Glycomics analysis

608

The full length S, S1 and S2 proteins were subjected to N-glycomics analysis following the

609

protocols published previously48 with some modifications. Briefly, 20 µg each of the

610

recombinant proteins were lyophilized and digested with PNGase F (P0701S, New England

611

Biolabs Inc.) according to the manufacture’s instruction. Post digestion, the glycans were

612

purified by Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (WAT054955, Waters Corp.) and subjected to

613

permethylation. The permethylated glycans were purified by chloroform extraction and Sep-

614

Pak C18 cartridges prior to mass spectrometric analysis.

615

MALDI-TOF MS and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS analysis of the permethylated glycans

616

were performed with the UltrafleXreme mass spectrometer (Bruker Corp.) equipped with a

617

Smartbeam II laser. Spectrum between mass-to-charge (m/z) 1000 and 5500 was acquired

618

under reflectron positive mode. Selective peaks were subject to MS/MS analysis. Each MS

619

spectrum presented an accumulation of 20,000 laser shots.

620
621

O-glycan LC-MS analysis

622

Three microgram of full-length S protein were treated with PNGase F (NEB) for N-glycan

623

release according to the manufacture’s instruction, followed by optional sialic acid removal

624

using 0.02 U sialidase (Roche), prior to in-gel trypsin treatment49. After overnight trypsin

625

treatment an optional AspN (Roche) digestion was performed in 1:25 ratio (enzyme:protein).

626

The samples were dried down in a speed vac concentrator, reconstituted in Cal and further

627

diluted in 0.1 % FA for subsequent LC-MS analysis. All samples were prepared in triplicates.

628

LC-MS was performed using an Ultimate 3000 nano LC coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion

629

Lumos mass spectrometer (both from Thermo Fisher). Three microliters of each sample were

630

loaded onto a C18 precolumn (C18 PepMap 100, 300 µm x 5 mm, 5 µm, 100 Å, Thermo

631

Fisher Scientific) with 15 µL/min solvent A (0.1% FA in H2O) for 3 min and separated on a

632

C18 analytical column (picofrit 75 µm ID x 150 mm, 3 µm, New Objective) using a linear

633

gradient of 2 % to 45 % solvent B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% FA) over 106 min at 400 nL/min.

634

The ion source was set at 2100 V spray voltage and 200 °C ion transfer tube temperature. MS

635

scans were performed in the orbitrap at a resolution of 60000 within a scan range of m/z 600

636

– m/z 1600, a RF lens of 30%, AGC target of 1e5 for a maximum injection time of 50 ms.

637

The top 15 precursors were selected for MS2 in a data dependent manner, within a mass

638

range of m/z 600 – 1600 and a minimum intensity threshold of 5e4 and an isolation width of

639

1.5 m/z. HCD was performed at 27 % collision energy and detected in the orbitrap with a

640

resolution of 30000 with the first mass at m/z 120, an AGC target of 2e5 and a maximum

641

injection of 250 ms.

642

EThcD spectra were acquired in a product ion-dependent manner ([HexNAc+H]+-ion) based

643

on the method above. Precursor isolation width was set to 1.2 m/z. Calibrated charge-

644

dependent ETD parameters were used with supplemental activation collision energy of 25%,

645

an AGC target of 2e5 and a maximum injection time of 350 ms.

646

Glycopeptide identification was performed using Byonic version 3.5 (Protein Metrics Inc.).

647

Trypsin and/or AspN were set as proteases with a maximum of two missed cleavage sites.

648

Mass tolerance for the precursor and HCD fragments was 10 ppm and for EThcD 20 ppm.

649

The glycan database was “O-glycan 78 mammalian”. The following modifications were

650

allowed: carbamidomethyl (Cys; fixed), oxidation (Met; variable common 2), pyroglutamine

651

on N-term (Gln, variable, rare 1), acetylation N-term (variable rare1), deamidation (Asn,

652

variable common 2), formylation N-term (variable rare1). Glycopeptides with a score above

653

250 were selected and further manually inspected.

654
655

scRNA-sequencing

656

For the expression of ACE2 and receptor genes across different tissues, datasets were

657

retrieved from published datasets in multiple human tissues, including lung and upper

658

airway50, 51, ileum52, colon53, pancreas54, spleen55 and thymus56. These datasets are available

659

and can be visualized and assessed through a website portal (www.covid19cellatlas.org)32.

660

The processed .h5ad files were loaded by “read_h5ad” and violin plots were illustrated by

661

“pl.stacked_violin” in scanpy 1.5.1, which is a model for single cell analysis in Python57. For

662

the single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of bronchoalveolar immune cells in patients with

663

SARS-CoV-2, dataset was retrieved from Liao et al.12 and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)

664

under the accession number GSE145926, which contains 6 severe and 3 moderate SARS-

665

CoV-2 patients and 3 healthy controls12.

666

The raw data with .h5 format was loaded for analysis through R package Seurat v358, 59. For

667

each sample, cells were filtered out if they contain genes less than 200 or more than 6000, or

668

if their UMI is less than 1000, or mitochondrial gene percentage larger than 0.1. The

669

remaining cells were integrated into a gene-barcode matrix and then normalized and log-

670

transformed. We identified 2000 highly variable genes by ‘vst’ method for the downstream

671

PCA analysis. RNA count and the percent of mitochondrial genes were regressed out in the

672

scaling step. We chose the top 50 principal components for the UMAP and graph-based

673

clustering. The cell type identity was referred to Liao et al.12 and feature genes were

674

demonstrated by “DimPlot”.
