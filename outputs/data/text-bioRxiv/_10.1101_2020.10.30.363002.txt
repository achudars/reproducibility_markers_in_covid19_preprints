Abstract
Intraviral protein-protein interactions are crucial for replication, pathogenicity, and viral
assembly. Among these, virus assembly is a critical step as it regulates the arrangements of viral
structural proteins and helps in the encapsulation of genomic material. SARS-CoV-2 structural
proteins play an essential role in the self-rearrangement, RNA encapsulation, and mature virus
particle formation. In SARS-CoV, the membrane protein interacts with the envelope and spike
protein in Endoplasmic Reticulum Golgi Intermediate Complex (ERGIC) to form an assembly in
the lipid bilayer, followed by membrane-ribonucleoprotein (nucleocapsid) interaction. In this
study, using protein-protein docking, we tried to understand the interaction of membrane
protein's interaction with envelope, spike and nucleocapsid proteins. Further, simulation studies
performed up to 100ns agreed that protein complexes M-E, M-S, and M-N were stable.
Moreover, the calculated free binding energy and dissociation constant values support the protein
complex formation. The interaction identified in the study will be of great importance, as it
provides valuable insight into the protein complex, which could be the potential drug targets for
future studies.

Introduction
Seven types of coronaviruses infect humans, among which severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS-CoV), middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 viruses are
primarily focused [1–3]. The coronaviruses structural proteins make up the viral symmetry and
enclose the positive-sense single-stranded RNA of ∼30-kb size [1]. The S protein consists of S1
and S2 subunit, which recognizes the human receptor ACE-2 and mediates the viral membrane
fusion with the host plasma membrane [4,5]. Whereas the N protein is phosphorylated and highly
basic, which primarily function is associated with the packaging of viral genomic RNA [6,7].
The CoV N protein contains two RNA-binding domains: the N-terminal domain and the Cterminal domain, linked by a serine/arginine-rich domain (SRD) [8–11]. The role of SRD is vital
for effective virus replication [12]. The M protein is a transmembrane protein consisting of Nterminal ectodomain and a C-terminal endodomain [13–15].
Viruses use Protein-Protein interactions (PPI) to reach out and hijack its host cellular network
[16,17]. The virus-host PPI map is invaluable, as it provides insight into the virus behavior and
its mode of action [18–20]. Recently, targeting of virus (SARS-CoV-2)-host PPI shows 66
druggable human proteins/host factors targeted by 69 compounds [16]. Experimental techniques
such as biomolecular fluorescence complementation, co-immunoprecipitation, and yeast twohybrid have extensive use to detect virus-host PPI, which also shed light on the intraviral PPI
[21–24]. The M protein expressed in higher propensity during infection interacts with N protein
and plays a vital role in assembling virus particles [25–27]. The M-M interaction occurs by the
transmembrane domain [28]. Further, the C-terminal endodomain is the hotspot for proteinprotein interaction with N and S proteins [27,29–32]. Besides the role of M protein's C-terminal
in M-N interactions, multiple regions of M protein are responsible for M-E and M-S interactions
[26]. In SARS-CoV, the amino acids 168–208 in the N protein are essential for oligomerization
and N-M interactions [25]. PPI plays a critical role in stabilizing N protein-RNA interactions
[33]. However, the N protein interaction with the C terminal of M protein involves multiple M
endodomain regions [28]. But it is not known in the case of SARS-CoV-2 whether these regions
interact or not?
On the other side, computational techniques such as protein-protein interaction networks based
on phylogeny methods and structure-based protein-protein docking are now very impactful and

faster to identify the interaction sites in protein [34,35]. In this context, we propose to study the
protein-protein interaction of M-E, M-S, and M-N of SARS-CoV-2 with protein-protein docking
and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) methods. The primary goal to perform docking is to
reveal interaction sites and the generation of protein-protein complexes. Further, atomic-level
MD simulations help to characterize the structure and dynamics of protein-protein complexes
[36]. In this study, MD allows us to understand the association-dissociation propensity of protein
complex during a single trajectory. Moreover, the study's outcome will highlight the mechanistic
details, i.e., intermediates and transition state, along with the protein complex's associationdissociation, which could be used as a potential drug target to counter the pathogenicity
associated with SARS-CoV-2.
Material and Methods
Protein structure modeling and preparation: Many SARS-CoV-2 proteins structure, i.e.,
spike, protease, and RdRp, reported by X-ray crystallography or Cryo-EM techniques [37–39].
However, several other proteins, such as full-length nucleocapsid, envelope, and membrane, do
not have structure available yet. Therefore, we have utilized the structure models of the
envelope, and membrane proteins, generated by the Zhang lab using the I-Tasser web server
[40]. Here we also built the model for the full-length 3D structure of S protein and used for
protein-protein docking. Firstly, the protein structures prepared using the protein preparation
wizard and docked using Schrodinger LLC using our previously defined protocols [41,42].
Protein-protein docking
The PIPER program embedded in the BioLuminate module of Schrodinger for protein-protein
docking was implemented to docking M protein with E, S, and N proteins [43,44]. A detailed
methodology has been given in our previous report [41]. PIPER performs a global search with
Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) approach and reduces the false-positive results. Among 1000
conformations of input structures, the top 50 clusters were selected with a cluster radius of 9 Å.
The docking outcomes based on cluster size were evaluated. With the most massive cluster size,
the docked complex out of 5 complexes was selected for molecular dynamics simulation. A total
of 70,000 rotations were allowed to generate five docked complexes for all setups.
MD Simulations of protein-protein complexes

For MD simulation of docked protein-protein complex, three setups were generated for M-E, MN, and M-S proteins. The binding and their interacting stability were observed for a 100 ns
timescale. Simulation of these complexes carried in the Desmond simulation package, which
utilizes OPLS 2005 forcefield to calculate bonded and non-bonded parameters and energy
parameters [45,46]. Previously, the C-terminal region of SARS-CoV M protein was found to
interact with N protein [26]. Therefore, in our study, simulation of the M-N protein complex was
provided with a lipid bilayer (POPE; 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine)
environment around M's transmembrane regions. All systems fed up with the TIP4P water
model, 0.15 M NaCl salt, neutralizing counterions, and minimized for 5000 iterations using the
steepest descent method. Final production run carried out at an average temperature of 310K, and
1 bar pressure maintained using Noose-Hover chain thermostat and Martyna-Tobias-Klein
barostat methods.
Binding energy calculation
PRODIGY (PROtein binDIng enerGY) webserver used to calculate the binding free energy (ΔG)
and to predict the dissociation constant (Kd) of the protein-protein complexes [47].
Results
Membrane-Envelope interaction
As shown in figure 1A, the protein-protein complex of M and E proteins have been formed by
multiple aromatic hydrogen bonds and a pi-pi stacking through N-terminal residues Cys33,
Phe37, Tyr39, and His125 of Membrane protein (figure 1A, Table 1). The binding energy
calculated for M-E docked complex from the PRODIGY server was -10.1 kcal/mol. Further, the
complex was subjected to MD simulations for 100 ns and analyzed for its stability
(Supplementary movie 1). We have also calculated the simulated frames' binding energy at
every 25ns of the trajectory (Table 2). From figure 1B, the M-E complex was relatively stable
with RMSD at ~6Å up to half simulation time and showed upward fluctuation up to 9Å. The
mean changes of M and E protein residues within the interaction site were less compared to the
non-interacting region. Similarly, the number of hydrogen bonds found increased between both
proteins throughout the simulation period, with an average of ~5.

The S protein interacts with M in ERGIC; therefore, these two proteins' docked complex show
promising interactions viz. multiple aromatic hydrogen bonds, pi-cation, and pi-pi stacking
(figure 2A). The interacting residues of S proteins are at C-terminal, which are represented and
tabulated in table 1. The binding energy of the M-S docked complex was -18.4 kcal/mol.
Further, we have investigated the M-S complex's binding stability through MD simulations upto
100 ns (Supplementary movie 2). The RMSD values from MD simulation trajectory were
trending upward from 5 to 20Å up to 40ns but stabilized till the rest of the simulation period. The
RMSF plot of the loosely packed S protein model with 1273 residues showed massive
fluctuations near 400th-500th residues up to 40Å (figure 2B). However, the changes in interacting
site residues of S protein's C-terminal is relatively less around 8Å. The binding free energy from

Membrane-Nucleocapsid interaction
The protein-protein docking of M-N complex showed a total of three residues of N protein viz.
Arg107, Lys256, and Tyr268 are interacting with residues Trp58, Asp163, and Ser184 of M
protein (Figure 3A, Table 1). The docked complex M-N has attained the binding energy of -8.3
kcal/mol. Based on simulation analysis, the M-N protein-protein complex was found stable
(Supplementary movie 3) with an average RMSD of approx. 6.8 Å (Figure 3B). The number of
intermediate hydrogen bonds formed within the simulation setup was ~ 7 up to 100ns timescale.
However, there was a fluctuating trend in RMSF values throughout the simulation from 2Å to
6Å in N protein residues. These fluctuations may be due to high disorder propensity in N protein.
The RMSF values of interacting residues of M protein were 1.7 Å (Trp58), 1.2 Å (Arg107), 2.1
Å (Asp163) and for N protein 4.9 Å (Lys256), 2.2 Å (Ser184), and 2.9 Å (Tyr268) for 100ns
simulation period (Figure 3B). The binding free energy of complexes from the simulation
trajectory was higher than the complex obtained from protein-protein docking (-8.3 to 11.3
kcal/mol, Table 2).

Discussion
Intraviral Protein-Protein interactions play an essential role in the coronavirus life cycle,,
specifically during the replicating complex formation as elucidated from several structural
ral
studies [48–50]. The RNA dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12) of SARS-CoV interacts with
ith
nsp7 and nsp8 and increases the RNA-synthesizing activity [48]. The nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 also
lso
associate with the nsp14 (proofreading enzyme) [48]. The cryo-EM studies showed that the nsp7
p7
and nsp8 heterodimers stabilize RNA binding regions of nsp12, while the second subunit of nsp8
p8
plays a vital role in polymerase activity [49]. Further, structural studies showed that nsp10
10
interacts with the N-terminal domain of nsp14 to stabilize it and stimulate its activity [50].
Similarly, the SARS-CoV structural proteins have been reported to interact with each other and
nd
play an essential role in virus assembly [6,15,28]. Therefore, in this study, we report the
he

intraviral PPI among structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, where we have computationally shown
that the M proteins interact with other structural proteins to form complexes of M-E, M-S, and
M-N, which responsible for the proper virus assembly. We have performed protein-protein
docking to identify the regions and residues which interact during these bindings. We have
investigated these in membrane protein with several interacting structural proteins such as
envelope, spike, and nucleocapsid proteins, respectively. Previously, in SARS-CoV, mutationbased studies showed that M protein is vital for virus assembly and interact with other structural
proteins [26]. The entire C-terminus domain of M proteins was found to interact with N protein
[26,29,31]. Similarly, two transmembrane domains and the cytoplasmic domain of M protein
were reported to interact with E protein [26]. There are multiple regions of M protein that
interact with spike glycoprotein [26]. Therefore, we have considered the M protein as a receptor
and S, E, and N proteins as protein ligands, in this study. The M protein is a triple spanning
membrane protein, and cytosolic side region is solely responsible for the interaction of M-N;
therefore, in the case of M-N docking, cytosolic part of M protein was targeted for interaction
with N protein.
To understand the stability of docked complexes and formed interactions, we have performed
long MD simulations. The simulation studies showed resilience in docked protein complexes of
M-E, M-S, and M-N. The binding energy was found in good agreement with the results and
allowed good binding of intraviral structural proteins. Our computational studies agree with
previous reports, where particle assembly occurs in the Endoplasmic Reticulum-Golgi
intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and finally trafficked for release via exocytosis [51]

Conclusion
Despite the small genome of viruses, they are highly pathogenic/infectious, and their genomee
integrity allows them to hijack the cellular machinery. Viruses for rapid infection and replication
on
follow multiple pathways. In between regulating host cellular system, it is essential to co-ordinates among own proteins for proper assembly and genome encapsulation. Here, PPI plays
ys
an important role in coronaviruses where structural protein interacts with each other, encapsulate
ate
the genome, and forms mature viruses. It could be a great interest to study these PPIs in drug
ug
targeting, as disruption of virus assembly will lead to immature virion formation. In this context,
xt,
the present study may help to design the mutation-based study to understand PPI in SARS-CoV-2. Further, it is still an open question of how these structural proteins interact specifically in the
he
presence of several host proteins? What are the driving forces which lead to the formation of
proteins assembly and virus particle formations? Additional studies on binding mechanism and
nd
energy favorable interaction of structural protein could help us develop new strategies against

protein-protein inhibition.
