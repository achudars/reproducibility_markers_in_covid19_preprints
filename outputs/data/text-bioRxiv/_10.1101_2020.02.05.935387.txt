Abstract
Since December 2019, the outbreak of a new coronavirus, named 2019nCoV, has greatly threatened the public health in China and raised great
concerns worldwide. No specific treatment for this infection is currently
available. We previously reported that teicoplanin, a glycopeptide
antibiotic which has routinely been used in the clinic to treat bacterial
infection with low toxicity, significantly inhibits the invasion of cells by
Ebola virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, via specifically inhibiting the
activity of cathepsin L. Here, we tested the efficacy of teicoplanin against
2019-nCoV virus infection and found that teicoplanin potently prevents the
entrance of 2019-nCoV-Spike-pseudoviruses into the cytoplasm, with an
IC50 of 1.66 μM. Although the inhibitory effect upon the replication of
wildtype viruses ex vivo and in vivo remains to be determined, our
preliminary result indicates that the potential antiviral activity of
teicoplanin could be applied for the treatment of 2019-nCoV virus
infection.

Introduction
The coronaviruses are enveloped, positive sense single-stranded RNA
viruses

1,2

. The well-known examples, which have emerged as important

human pathogens, include severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARSCoV) in China in 2003 and middle east respiratory syndrome CoV (MERSCoV) in the Arabian Peninsula since 20123-9. Recently a novel coronavirus
outbreaks in December 2019 as the pathogenic agent that causes series of
pneumonia cases in Wuhan of China has quickly raised intense attention
not only in China but also internationally

10-14

. This novel coronavirus,

named as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), belongs to the betacoronavirus according to the sequence released13,15. Evolutionary analyses
have shown that the 2019-nCoV shares 79% homology with SARS-CoV
and 50% with MERS-CoV 15-17. Given the high infectious rate and the lack
of effective treatment for 2019-nCoV, it is quite urgent to develop an
efficient antiviral drug for 2019-nCoV.
The spike glycoprotein (S protein) is the leading mediator of viral
entry, and the important determinant of host range of coronaviruses 18. The
infection of SARS virus is initiated by the attachment of S protein to the
receptor ACE219, followed by cleavage with host cell protease TMPRSS2
20-22

. The viruses are then transported through the early and late endosomes,

subsequently endo/lysosomes, during which host protein extracellular
proteases including cathepsin L mediates the further cleavage of S protein

in endocytic vesicles23-26. The activated S protein will then activate the
fusion between viral and cell membranes and release the genome of SARSCoV into cytoplasm.
In 2016, our team had found that teicoplanin, a routinely-used clinical
glycopeptide antibiotics, significantly inhibited the cellular entry of Ebola
virus, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV27. Further mechanistic studies showed
that teicoplanin blocked virus entry by specifically inhibiting the activity
of cathepsin L, opening a novel avenue for the development of
glycopeptides as potential inhibitors of cathepsin L-dependent viruses. In
this study, we have compared the cleavage site of cathepsin L in 2019nCoV with that in SARS-CoV and found it is well conserved. Furthermore,
we identified that teicoplanin also potently inhibited the entry of 2019nCoV pseudovirus, which provide a possible strategy to the prophylaxis
and treatment for2019-nCoV infection.

Materials and methods
Cell culture and recombinant viruses.
The plasmid containing spike (S) gene of 2019-nCoV was purchased
from Generay Biotech company (Shanghai, China) and inserted into
pcDNA3.1 vector. HIV-1/2019-nCoV-S/ pseudoviruses were produced
by the co-transfection of pHIV-luciferase, psPAX2, and plasmids
expressing different envelope or S proteins into HEK293T cells as

previously described 27. Briefly, the pseudoviruses including HIVluc/2019-nCoV-S, HIV-luc/SARS-CoV-S and HIV-luc/VSV-G were
harvested from supernatants after 48 hours post transfection and filtered
through a 0.45-μm pore-size filter and stored at -80 °C. HEK293T, A549
and Huh7 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (Gibco) with 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco), 100 units/ml
penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Gibco) at 37 °C and 5% CO2.
IC50 determination.
IC50 determination was carried out by luciferase assay from the infected
cells in the presence of various concentrations (2-fold dilutions) of the
teicoplanin. The IC50 curve was determined by using software from
GraphPad (San Diego).
siRNA transfection, RNA isolation, and RT-PCR.
Sequences of siRNA against cathepsin Lor TMPRSS2 were predesigned
by Ribobio Company (Guangzhou, China). A549 cells were seeded in 105
cells per ml in each well of 12-well-microtiter plates and transiently
transfected with siRNA (10–20 pmol/well) using lipofectinRNAimax
reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions in serum-free
medium with suitable scrambled siRNA control. Twenty-four hours later,
total RNAs from the transfected cells were extracted for knocking out
efficiency detection by qRT-PCR.
Sequence data collection and alignment

The genome sequences of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV were collected
from the GenBank database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/).
The sequences of SARS-CoV circulating in 2003 contain 6 strains
(accession number: AY278488, AY545918, AY545917, AY394977,
AY394978, AY394979). The sequences of 2019-nCoV include 9 from
Wuhan (MN908947, NC_045512, MN988668, MN988669, MN996527,
MN996528, MN996529, MN996530, MN996531), 2 from Shenzhen
(MN975262, MN938384) and 5 from USA (MN985325, MN988713,
MN994467, MN994468, MN997409). The S gene sequences were
obtained from the genome of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV according the
annotation in the GenBank database. The sequence datasets were aligned
using the ClustalW program implemented in MEGA X software28.
Consensus sequences were created using the BioEdit software
(http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html) based on the multiple
alignment of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV, respectively. The amino acid
sequence logos generated by using WebLogo29.
Statistics
Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 7. For data with
a normal distribution, we used a Student’s t test. For multiple
comparisons a one-way or two-way ANOVA (for parametric data)
followed by Bonferroni’s correction (only two groups were compared)
were used. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Cathepsin L is required for the cell entry of 2019-nCoV.
The proteolytic processing of the SARS-CoV S protein is essential for the
virus entry and fusion. Many cleavage sites of the relevant exogenous
protease including cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 involved in the proteolytic
processing of the SARS-CoV S protein have been experimentally
validated 20,30,31. Because cathepsin L has been identified as a target of
teicoplanin, it is important to identify whether the cleavage site of
cathepsin L exists on the 2019-nCOV S protein. After alignment, we
found that the cleavage site of cathepsin L is well conserved between the
SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV S protein (Figure 1A), suggesting that
cathepsin L could participant in the 2019-nCoV entry and fusion26,31,32.
Moreover, the cleavage site of cathepsin L was consistent among the
epidemic strains of 2019-nCoV retrieved from the GenBank database,
including 9 from Wuhan, 2 from Shenzhen, and 5 from USA (Figure 1B).
As such, we hypothesized that cathepsin L could be an important target
for the entry of 2019-nCoV. Accordingly, we infected the cells with
SARS-CoV-, or 2019- nCoV -S- pseudotyped HIV-1 viruses after
siRNA-mediated knockdown of the expression of cathepsin L and
TMPRSS2 and found that both cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 depletion
impaired the cell entry of pseudoviruses (Figure 1C), indicating that both

cathepsin L and TMPRSS2 are required for 2019- nCoV cell entry.

Teicoplanin specifically inhibits the entry of 2019-nCoV.
Based on our previous reported, we generated the HIV-luc/2019-nCoV-S
pseudoviruses (Figure 2A)27. The resulting viruses were then used to infect
A549 cells in the presence of teicoplanin. To exclude the possibility that
the drug inhibited the early events of HIV-1 life cycle, HIV-luc/VSV-G
pseudoviruses bearing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoproteins were
set up for a negative control group while pseudoviruses bearing the SARSCoV-S were used a positive control27. Here, we identified that teicoplanin
acted specifically as a 2019-nCoV entry inhibitor in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 2B). It demonstrated an IC50 of 1.66 uM for its inhibitory
effect on HIV-luc/2019-nCoV-S pseudoviruses (Figure. 2C).

Teicoplanin and dalbavancin repress the entry of 2019-nCoV in
different cell types.
Considering that ACE2 is a major receptor of 2019-nCoV, we have
further analyzed the expression of ACE2 in different cell types from the
GEO Profiles database and it was important to examine whether
teicoplanin could repress the entry of 2019-nCoV viruses into different
types of cells. The data showed that teicoplanin also effectively repressed
virus entrance into HEK293T cells (Figure. 3A), and Huh7 cells (Figure

3B). As we have previously demonstrated that several glycopeptide
antibiotics, including teicoplanin and dalbavancin, exhibited specific
inhibitory effects on cathepsin L, we therefore hypothesized that
teicoplanin and its homologs could also inhibit the entry of 2019-nCoV.
The data illustrated that the dalbavancin also repressed the entry of 2019nCoV in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3C). However, vancomycin,
another routinely-used antibiotics, did not inhibit the 2019-nCoV entry
(Figure. 3D). There results were consistent with the previous inhibitory
effect of several glycopeptide antibiotics on SARS-CoV and MERSCoV27.

Discussion
Host cell entry is the first step of viral life cycle and is an ideal drug
target for viral infection. In this study, we identified that teicoplanin
could inhibit the entry of HIV-1-2019-nCoV-S pseudoviruses with the
IC50 value of 1.66 uM. During the invasion phase, 2019-nCoV first binds
to the receptor ACE2 on the surface of host cells. The interaction between
RBD domain of S protein and ACE2 triggers conformational changes
within S protein, which render the S protein susceptible to activation by
host cell protease TMPRSS220,30,33. Subsequently, the 2019-nCoV virus
enters the early endosome of the cell through endocytosis or
macropinocytosis. During the early endosome maturation process, the

endosome gradually acidifies, which has an important impact on the entry
of virus into cells. The inhibitory effect of chloroquine on 2019-nCoV
support this hypothesis17,34. The cysteine proteases cathepsin L in the
endosome can further cleave the S protein, and activate the membrane
fusion. It has been proposed that sequential cleavages of SARS-CoV S
protein by TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L are necessary for fully exposure of
fusion peptide at S2 region to the late endosome/lysosome membrane35.
Our work indicates that both TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L are required for
2019-nCoV entrance, and teicoplanin potently prevents the 2019-nCoV S
protein activation by directly inhibiting the enzymatic activity of
cathepsin L (Figure 4)27.
Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic, which is mainly used for
serious infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria such as
staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus 36-38. As a routinely-used clinical
antibiotics, teicoplanin is well known for its much low toxic and side
effects, long half-life in blood plasma, convenient administration, and
high safety when used in combination with other antibiotics. The
recommended plasma concentration of teicoplanin for clinical use to
inhibit Gram-positive bacteria is 15 mg / L, or 8.78 μM, and the
commonly used dose is 400 mg / day. Here we found the IC50 inhibition
of 2019-nCOV was only 1.66 uΜ, which is much lower than the routine
clinical drug concentration. Therefore, the routinely-used dose (400 mg /

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.05.935387; this version posted February 13, 2020. The copyright holder for this

day) could be considered for patients with 2019-nCOV infection. If the
effect is not significant, dose could be optimized because of its low
toxicity. The doses such as 800 mg / day or 1200 mg / day could be
considered to improve the drug efficiency. Given that the principle of
antiviral therapy is to prevent virus infection and amplification at a stage
as early as possible, it is reasonable to recommend the use of teicoplanin
for 2019-nCoV in the early stage. Alternatively, it could substitute
vancomycin or other antibiotics to treat the co-infection with Grampositive bacteria at a proper time. As such, teicoplanin could function as a
dual inhibitor for both the 2019-nCOV infection and co-infection with
Gram-positive bacteria.
