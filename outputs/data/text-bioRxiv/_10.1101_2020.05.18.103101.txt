Abstract

2

Cells use sophisticated molecular circuits to interpret and respond to extracellular signal

3

factors, such as hormones and cytokines, which are often released in a temporally varying fashion.

4

In this study, we focus on type I interferon (IFN) signaling in human epithelial cells and combine

5

microfluidics, time-lapse microscopy, and computational modeling to investigate how the IFN-

6

responsive regulatory network operates in single cells to process repetitive IFN stimulation. We

7

found that IFN-a pretreatments lead to opposite effects, priming versus desensitization,

8

depending on the input durations. These effects are governed by a regulatory network composed

9

of a fast-acting positive feedback loop and a delayed negative feedback loop, mediated by

10

upregulation of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18). We further revealed that USP18

11

upregulation can only be initiated at the G1 and early S phases of cell cycle upon the treatment

12

onset, resulting in heterogeneous and delayed induction kinetics in single cells. This cell cycle

13

gating provides a temporal compartmentalization of feedback control processes, enabling

14

duration-dependent desensitization to repetitive stimulations. Moreover, our results, highlighting

15

the importance of IFN dynamics, may suggest time-based strategies for enhancing the

16

effectiveness of IFN pretreatment in clinical applications against viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

2

Under physiological conditions, cells often encounter environmental cues that change

3

over time. Many hormones, cytokines, and signal factors are released in a temporally varying

4

fashion. Increasing evidence demonstrated that cells can use complex signaling networks to

5

interpret the dynamic patterns of these inputs and initiate appropriate cellular responses [1, 2].

6

For example, the mitogen-activated protein kinase Hog1 pathway in the yeast S. cerevisiae

7

responds to the various frequencies of oscillating osmotic stress and differentially control the

8

growth rate under stress [3-5]. Moreover, the gene regulatory program mediated by the yeast

9

general stress responsive transcription factors (TFs) Msn2 and Msn4 can decode various input

10

pulses and induce differential gene expression [6-9]. In mammalian systems, it has been shown

11

that the nuclear factor kB (NFkB) pathway can process the pulsatile stimulation of tumor necrosis

12

factor-a (TNF-a) to determine the timing and specificity of downstream gene expression [10-12].

13

Similarly, the p53 tumor suppressor differentially regulates target genes and cell fates by

14

processing temporal patterns of DNA damage cues [13-15]. Intriguingly, many of these studies

15

observed that individual cells exhibit widely different behaviors even to the same stimuli, and, as

16

a result, population-based measurements may obscure the actual response dynamics of

17

individual cells, leading to inaccurate interpretation of the data. Furthermore, these observed cell-

18

to-cell variabilities play important roles in enhancing the diversity of physiological behaviors and

19

biological functions [16-20]. In this study, we focus on interferon (IFN)-a signaling in human

20

epithelial cells and investigate how the IFN-driven gene regulatory network operates in single

21

cells to decode various signal dynamics.

22

IFN-a is a member of the type I IFN family of cytokines, which are synthesized and

23

secreted in mammals upon pathogen infection and initiate innate immune responses to limit

24

pathogen spread via reducing protein production, upregulating antiproliferative and antiviral

25

genes, and programmed cell death [21, 22]. IFN-a has also been clinically used in treatments of

26

a variety of diseases, such as hepatitis B and C infection, HIV infection, melanoma, kidney cancer,

27

leukemia and lymphoma [23, 24]. IFN-a exerts its anti-pathogenic and anti-proliferative effects by

28

activating the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway,

29

leading to the expression of over 300 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) [21, 25]. IFN-a binds to a

30

heterodimeric transmembrane receptor, the IFN-a receptor (IFNAR), triggering the activation of

31

receptor-associated kinases Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), which in turn

32

phosphorylate transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and

33

STAT2. The phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 dimerize and associate with IFN-regulatory factor

9 (IRF9) to form IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex. ISGF3 then translocates to the

2

nucleus and binds to the DNA consensus sequences, known as IFN-stimulated response element

3

(ISRE), activating the transcription of ISGs [26, 27]. The duration and strength of the IFN-

4

mediated inflammatory responses are tightly controlled in mammals. A response that is too short

5

or too weak will fail to limit pathogen spread, whereas a response that is too prolonged or too

6

strong will result in tissue damage, organ failure, and carcinogenesis [28-30]. In many epidemics,

7

uncontrolled inflammatory responses to infection have led to the cytokine storm and high mortality

8

[31, 32].

9

Although the molecular components of the JAK-STAT pathway have been well

10

characterized, how they are regulated to generate appropriate responses to dynamic IFN-a inputs

11

remains largely elusive. In particular, during chronic inflammation, cells receive varying IFN

12

signals from neighboring cells [33-35]. However, previous studies have reported opposing results

13

regarding the effect of IFN-a pretreatment. In some studies, a prior exposure to IFN-a accelerates

14

cells’ responses to the second IFN input, enabling a “priming” effect [36-39]. In other studies,

15

however, a pretreatment with IFN-a diminishes the responses to the following stimulation,

16

resulting in a “desensitization” effect [40-42]. To resolve this paradox, we combined time-lapse

17

imaging, microfluidics, and computational modeling to track and quantify JAK-STAT signaling and

18

downstream gene expression in single human epithelial cells. We revealed that a cell cycle-gated

19

negative feedback loop functions to decode IFN pretreatments with different durations and induce

20

differential single-cell responses, reconciling the opposing results from previous studies. A

21

number of recent studies have shown that type I IFN pretreatment could be an effective preventive

22

strategy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection [43-

23

45], which causes the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings unravel the important role of the

24

dynamics of IFN pretreatments on modulating cellular responses, suggesting that optimizing

25

administration timing may help boosting the effectiveness of IFN treatment against SARS-CoV-2.

IFNs. To monitor the dynamics of JAK-STAT signaling at the single cell level, we constructed a

2

reporter cell line in HeLa cells, in which STAT1 was C-terminally tagged with mCherry at its native

3

locus using CRISPR/Cas9. In addition, to monitor downstream gene expression, we inserted a

4

yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) under the endogenous promoter of a representative ISG IRF9

5

(PIRF9), with a translational skip spacer (P2A) between the reporter and the IRF9 coding region

6

(Fig.1A; Fig. S1, A-C). Using this reporter cell line and time-lapse microscopy, we were able to

7

simultaneously track nuclear translocation of STAT1 and downstream gene expression in a large

8

number of single cells (Fig. 1B). We observed a rapid nuclear translocation (within ~0.5 hours) of

9

STAT1 followed by a gradual increase in PIRF9-driven gene expression in response to IFN-a

10

stimulation (Fig. 1B and 1C; Movie S1), consistent with traditional western blotting results (Fig.

11

S2, D). For each single cell, we quantified the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio of STAT1, which

12

resembles STAT1 activation, and the rate of increase in YFP fluorescence (dYFP/dt) to reflect

13

the PIRF9-driven transcriptional activity. STAT1 nuclear translocation correlated temporally with the

14

increase in downstream transcriptional activity (Fig. 1C). We examined single-cell responses to

15

various doses of IFN-a (Fig. S2) and chose 100 ng/ml (10000 IU/ml), a sub-saturating and

16

clinically relevant [51] concentration, for the following analyses.

17

To examine the responses to repetitive IFN-a stimulation, we employed a previously

18

reported microfluidic device designed for mammalian cell culturing [52]. The device features rapid

19

cell loading by on-chip vacuum and long-term cell culturing in chambers that are isolated from

20

shear stress. In this study, we modified the device to enable constant flows for medium refreshing

21

and computer-programmed dynamic control of IFN inputs (Fig. 1D). Using this device, we first

22

exposed the cells to a pulse of IFN-a pretreatment with different durations, followed by an 8-hour

23

break time with the normal medium. We then imposed a second 10-hour IFN-a treatment and

24

evaluated single-cell responses. The device was integrated with time-lapse microscopy to allow

25

tracking of a large number of single cells throughout the experiments (Fig. 1D). We found that a

26

2- or 10-hour pretreatment accelerated and enhanced the transcriptional response to the second

27

IFN-a input, as indicated by increased induction rates and levels of the PIRF9-driven reporter,

28

compared to the control without pretreatment (Fig. 1, E and F; compare green and blue

29

curves/bars with black ones). Intriguingly, a 24-hour pretreatment, however, dramatically

30

decreased the transcriptional response to the second input (Fig. 1, E and F; compare red

31

curves/bars with black ones). Therefore, a pretreatment of IFN-a, depending on its duration, could

32

lead to opposite effects on the responses to the subsequent input. A short pretreatment induces

33

a priming effect, whereas a prolonged pretreatment triggers desensitization. We also examined

34

how changing the dose of IFN pretreatment impacts the effect on the response to the second

input and found that a dose higher than 10 ng/ml is required for desensitization in 24-hour

2

pretreatment (Fig. S3, A-C).

3
4

USP18 is responsible for desensitization induced by the prolonged IFN-a pretreatment

5

We next considered the mechanisms underlying the opposite effects induced by IFN

6

pretreatments. Previous studies have demonstrated that the priming effect can be attributed to

7

the expression induction of IRF9, STAT1 and STAT2, which are components of ISGF3

8

transcriptional complex that mediates IFN-driven gene expression [53], and IFN-induced

9

chromatin modifications [54]. To determine the mechanism of desensitization caused by the

10

prolonged pretreatment, we use a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to knock-down the expression of

11

ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (USP18), a major negative regulator of JAK-STAT signaling that

12

we identified previously [55-58], in the reporter cell line (Fig. S4, USP18-KD). USP18 is

13

transcriptionally upregulated by IFN treatment and exerts inhibition of IFN-a signaling at the

14

receptor level, forming a negative feedback loop [41, 59-61].

15

We found that a 24-hour IFN-a pretreatment substantially diminished STAT1 nuclear

16

translocation in WT cells upon the second IFN input, whereas 2-hour or 10-hour pretreatment

17

shows a modest effect (Fig. 2A, “WT”). However, this desensitization effect was abolished when

18

USP18 expression was knocked down (Fig. 2A, “USP18-KD”). Furthermore, in accord with STAT1

19

nuclear translocation, IFN-a pretreatments boosted the transcriptional responses in USP18-KD

20

cells upon the second input, exhibiting priming effects independent of their durations or doses

21

(Fig. 2, B and C; Fig. S3, D-F). These results indicate that desensitization is primarily mediated

22

by USP18. We also examined the role of suppressors of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), another

23

negative regulator of JAK-STAT signaling [62]. In contrast to USP18-KD, knocking down SOCS1

24

(SOCS1-KD) did not affect the desensitization of STAT1 nuclear translocation by the prolonged

25

IFN pretreatment (Fig. S5). Moreover, to determine how USP18-mediated desensitization

26

influences the antiviral effect of IFN-a treatment, we examined viral replication upon IFN-a

27

pretreatments with different durations. While a 10-hour pretreatment to WT cells resulted in a

28

substantial repression of viral replication, extending the pretreatment to 24 hours only furthered

29

the repression modestly. In contrast, the 24-hour pretreatment, in USP18-KD, induced a much

30

more dramatic repression of viral replication (Fig. S6). These results indicated that USP18-

31

mediated desensitization attenuates the antiviral effect of prolonged IFN-a pretreatment.

Computational modeling suggests a delayed negative feedback loop through USP18

1

Based on our experimental results, we postulated that the opposite effects induced by

2

short versus prolonged pretreatment inputs might be caused by different expression kinetics of

3

ISGF3 components and USP18: a short input is sufficient to trigger ISGF3 expression and thereby

4

the priming effect, whereas a prolonged input is required to induce USP18 expression and hence

5

desensitization. To test this hypothesis in silico, we devised a simple computational model, which

6

is composed of two ordinary differential equations that govern the expression of IRF9, an ISGF3

7

component, and USP18. In this model, IRF9 and USP18 act as the positive and the negative

8

feedback regulators of the JAK-STAT pathway, respectively. Another major difference is that, as

9

we proposed above, the upregulation of USP18 expression features a delayed kinetics and hence

10

requires a continuous IFN stimulation that lasts longer than the delay time t, whereas the

11

upregulation of IRF9 initiates immediately upon the IFN treatment (Fig. 3A; see Materials and

12

Methods for details).

13

This model was able to reproduce the results from pretreatment experiments, where the

14

priming effect dominates for the short pretreatments (2 and 10-hour pretreatments) and the

15

desensitization effect dominates when the pretreatment duration increases to 24 hours (Fig. 1, E

16

and F). To investigate the effect of the delay in USP18 upregulation, we altered the delay time

17

from 1 to 20 hours while keeping all the other parameters free. By fitting the model to the data for

18

each assigned delay time, we found that the fitting error (between simulations and data) reaches

19

the minimum when the delay time is 8 hours (Fig. 3, B and C). Based on this 8-hour delay time in

20

USP18 upregulation, the model further predicted that repetitive IFN input pulses, with the duration

21

less than 8 hours, could not trigger the USP18-mediated negative feedback loop and hence could

22

lead to a higher transcriptional response than that induced by a prolonged input with the same

23

total treatment time. For example, pulsatile inputs with 5 x 8-hour pulses could produce a higher

24

transcriptional response than that induced by a 40-hour sustained input, and the difference should

25

be USP18-dependent (Fig. 3, D and E). This prediction was tested experimentally and a higher

26

transcriptional response, indicated by the PIRF9-driven reporter, was observed when 5 x 8-hour

27

IFN pulses were given, compared to that induced by a single 40-hour treatment. Furthermore,

28

this difference caused by different input dynamics was abolished in USP18-KD cells (Fig. 3F; Fig.

29

S7).

30

In summary, our modeling results suggest that a prolonged input is required to initiate

31

USP18 upregulation. Therefore, when the input duration is short, the ISGF3-mediated positive

32

feedback loop dominates the regulation of JAK-STAT pathway, conferring the priming effect to

33

subsequent stimulation. Once the input duration is prolonged enough to induce USP18

upregulation, the negative regulation by USP18 overrides the positive regulation by ISGF3,

2

resulting in desensitization.

3
4

The kinetics of USP18 upregulation by IFN is heterogeneous in single cells

5

To test our model directly, we set out to compare the expression kinetics of IRF9 and

6

USP18 in living cells. To this end, we built upon the dual reporter cell line constructed in Fig. 1A

7

and inserted a cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) under the

8

endogenous USP18 promoter (PUSP18) with a P2A spacer between the reporter and the USP18

9

coding region (Fig. 4A; Fig. S8). This cell line enabled us to simultaneously track the kinetics of

10

PIRF9 and PUSP18 -driven gene expression in the same cells.

11

To evaluate the temporal difference in IRF9 and USP18 upregulation, we measured and

12

quantified, in each individual cell, the induction kinetics of PIRF9 and PUSP18 -driven gene expression

13

upon IFN stimulation. We defined the time needed for induction to initiate as “activation time” and

14

the difference between the activation times of IRF9 and USP18 as “delay time” (Fig. 4B). We

15

found that, consistent with our model results, IRF9 and USP18, although induced by the same

16

upstream JAK-STAT signaling, exhibited strikingly different activation times. PIRF9-driven

17

expression was induced with a fast and relatively uniform kinetics among cells; in contrast, PUSP18-

18

driven expression exhibited a slow and heterogeneous kinetics (Fig. 4C). Intriguingly, we

19

quantified the delay times of UPS18 induction, relative to that of IRF9, in single cells and observed

20

a bimodal distribution: about 83.3% of cells showed modest delays in induction (< 10 hours),

21

whereas the other 16.7% cells exhibited more prolonged delays (> 10 hours). We classified these

22

two subpopulations as “Group 1” and “Group 2”, respectively (Fig. 4D).

23

To determine the source of this clonal heterogeneity in USP18 induction, we considered

24

the contribution of the cell cycle stage at IFN treatment onset, as the cell cycle progression has

25

been shown as a major factor that coordinates gene expression [63]. To this end, we quantified

26

the extent of cell cycle progression in each single cell at IFN treatment onset (“% of cell cycle

27

progression”) and examined its relationship with the USP18 delay time in the same cell. We found

28

that cells showed modest delays if the treatment was added at the early phase of their cell cycles

29

(0 – 35% of the cell cycle). In contrast, in those cells that progressed beyond this phase, the IFN

30

treatment could not initiate USP18 induction until the next cell cycle, resulting in sharply extended

31

delay times (Fig. 4E). These results suggest that the cell-to-cell variability in USP18 delay times

32

may stem from different cell cycle stages among cells at the treatment onset.

33
34

Cell cycle phases differentially regulate USP18 expression

1

Our results in Fig. 4E suggest that the early phase of cell cycle (0 – 35% of the cell cycle

2

time), likely the G1 and early S stages, may provide a time window that allows immediate USP18

3

induction without significant delays. To directly test that, we imposed chemical perturbations to

4

arrest cells in G1 or G1/S stage and monitored the delay times of USP18 induction, relative to

5

that of IRF9. Specifically, we treated cells with serum starvation [64], lovastatin [65, 66], and

6

roscovitine [67], all of which arrested cells in G1 or G1/S stage, prior to the IFN-a treatment. As

7

expected, we observed that cell cycle synchronization substantially reduced the fraction of cells

8

with prolonged delays of USP18 induction (Fig. 5A).

9

Furthermore, to explicitly determine the cell cycle stages of individual cells at the treatment

10

onset and their relationships with USP18 induction delays, we generated another reporter cell line

11

in which we stably integrated a cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activity reporter [68], allowing

12

us to infer the cell cycle stages based on the dynamics of DNA helicase B (DHB) nuclear

13

translocation (Fig. 5B). In the same cell line, PUSP18-driven fluorescent reporter was introduced as

14

described in Fig. 4A. Using this cell line, we classified cells into three groups, G1, S, and G2 cells,

15

based on their cell cycle stages at the IFN treatment onset (Fig. 5C, left). We found that G1 and

16

S cells showed relatively fast USP18 activation times, whereas a large fraction of G2 cells

17

exhibited a substantial delay in USP18 induction (Fig. 5C, right). We also employed another cell

18

cycle reporter system called fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) [69] and

19

observed similar patterns to those obtained using the CDK2 activity reporter (Fig. S9). These

20

results, together with the cell cycle inhibitor data in Fig. 5A, confirmed the influence of cell cycle

21

stages on USP18 induction. The G1/S stages allow rapid induction of expression induction, but

22

the G2 stage restrains the initiation of gene induction, resulting in a prolonged delay in USP18

23

expression.

24

What is the mechanism underlying the effects of cell cycle stages on USP18 expression?

25

Previous studies revealed global variations of epigenetic modifications during cell cycle. For

26

instance, DNA methylation decreases in G1 and increases during S and G2 phases [70-72]. We

27

postulated that cell cycle progression might influence USP18 expression through variations in

28

DNA methylation. To test this possibility, we first searched the genome-wide DNA methylation

29

profiles of various human cell types. Intriguingly, the promoter of USP18 contains a large number

30

of CpG sites, which are highly methylated in all the cell types examined. In contrast, the IRF9

31

promoter contains less CpG sites and is less methylated [73] (Fig. S10). To determine whether

32

the promoter methylation influences USP18 expression, we treated cells with decitabine (also

33

known as 5-Aza-2’deoxycytidine), a commonly-used DNA methyltransferase inhibitor [74, 75]. We

34

observed that the fraction of cells with prolonged delay times in USP18 induction were

1

dramatically reduced, indicating that the promoter methylation inhibits USP18 induction (Fig. 5D).

2

This result is consistent with a previous study showing that a decreased promoter methylation

3

leads to increased USP18 expression in breast cancer [76]. We note that decitabine also leads

4

to cell cycle arrest in G2 stage [77]. Since USP18 induction is largely delayed in G2 (Fig. 5C), the

5

accelerating effect of decitabine on USP18 expression should be via inhibition of methylation

6

rather than cell cycle arrest. In summary, our results suggested that the cell cycle stages may

7

impact the initiation of USP18 upregulation through modulating the promoter methylation level.

9

Cell cycle-gated feedback control shapes single-cell responses to repetitive IFN inputs

10

Finally, we incorporated the cell cycle-gated regulation into our model, in replace of the

11

arbitrary delay time, to test whether it is sufficient to account for the experimentally-observed

12

delays in USP18 induction and, consequently, desensitization, at the single cell level. Based on

13

our experimental results (Figs. 4 and 5), we assumed that USP18 can be induced immediately if

14

the IFN input starts within a fixed time window (G1 and early S phases) of a cell cycle. However,

15

if the input starts outside of the window, cells will have to wait until the open window of the next

16

cell cycle with the delay time equals to the waiting time. We also assumed that the IFN input onset

17

time is uniformly distributed within a cell cycle. The length of a full cell cycle was estimated to be

18

21.82 hours based on the single-cell time trace measurements (Fig. S4D). The model was fit to

19

the experimentally-determined distribution of USP18 delay times within a cell cycle (Fig. 6B; the

20

data from Fig. 4E) and we obtained an estimate of the open window length to be 7.3 hours (~33%

21

of 21.82 hours). Using these experimentally-constrained parameters, we then performed

22

stochastic simulations of single-cell responses to different pretreatment experiments, by

23

introducing noise to gene expression reactions. We observed that the 24-hour pretreatment

24

effectively induced UPS18 upregulation, to a much higher extent than those upon 2-hour and 10-

25

hour pretreatments. Importantly, as shown in Fig. 6C, the higher levels of USP18 expression by

26

the prolonged pretreatment lead to reduced IRF9 induction upon the second stimulation at the

27

single-cell level, consistent with our experimental data (Fig.6D).

28

Taken together, our experimental and modeling results suggest that the cell cycle gating

29

can give rise to the delay in USP18 upregulation and USP18-mediated negative feedback loop,

30

wherein the delay time is largely determined by the length of the open window in the cell cycle (a

31

longer open window results in a shorter delay time). When the duration of pretreatment is shorter

32

than or close to the delay time (e.g. 2 or 10-hour pretreatment), USP18 can only be partially

33

induced in some cells so that the fast-acting positive feedback loop and the priming effect

34

dominate. In contrast, the 24-hour pretreatment, with a duration longer than the entire length of a

cell cycle, can fully induce USP18-mediated negative feedback in most cells regardless of their

2

cell cycle stages at treatment onset, resulting in desensitization to subsequent stimulation. In this

3

way, key regulatory processes can be compartmentalized temporally by the cell cycle to decode

dynamically-varying signals.

Discussion

7

IFN signaling is vital in initiating the innate immune response and providing the first line of

8

cellular defense against infection. Although much progress has been made in identifying

9

molecular components that mediate the IFN responses, what remains missing is an

10

understanding about how these components interact and operate dynamically to process varying

11

signals and fine-tune the extent and duration of responses. For example, how cells respond to

12

repetitive IFN stimulation remains puzzling, as previous studies led to opposing conclusions [37,

13

38, 41, 42]. In this study, we used microfluidics and time-lapse imaging to track the responses to

14

repetitive IFN inputs in single human epithelial cells. We found that the effects of IFN

15

pretreatments are governed by a gene regulatory network comprised of a fast-acting positive

16

feedback loop, in part through upregulation of ISGF3 components, and a delayed negative

17

feedback loop mediated by upregulation of USP18. A short pretreatment input can only induce

18

the positive feedback loop, leading to the priming effect to following stimulation, whereas a

19

prolonged pretreatment activates the negative feedback loop that desensitizes the pathway. Our

20

study reconciled the opposing results from previous studies and revealed that the effects of IFN

21

pretreatments depend on their input durations. This dynamics-based regulation stems from

22

coupled feedback loops that act with different kinetics. Regulatory circuits with coupled negative

23

and positive feedback loops have been discovered in many biological processes, and, depending

24

on the specific mechanisms and kinetics, can give rise to various dynamic behaviors, such as

25

sustained oscillations [78, 79] and excitable gene expression [80-82]. In this study, the coupled

26

feedback system in the JAK-STAT pathway enables a new function of this well-studied network

27

architecture: it serves as a timer that measures the initial input duration and coordinate the

28

temporal order of regulatory processes with opposing effects, leading to differential cellular

29

responses to subsequent stimuli.

30

Moreover, through a closer investigation of the delayed negative feedback, we found that

31

cell cycle phases at IFN treatment onset differentially influence USP18 upregulation, resulting in

32

heterogeneous delays in the induction of this signaling suppressor. More specifically, the G1 and

33

early S phases enable an open window for immediate USP18 upregulation upon the IFN

34

treatment. If cells are exposed to IFN when they pass the G1/S phases, the IFN treatment cannot

1

initiate USP18 induction until the G1 phase of the next cell cycle, causing a dramatic delay in the

2

induction kinetics. In this way, individual cells exhibit substantial cell-to-cell variability in their

3

USP18 induction delay times, as observed experimentally (Fig. 4D), which arises from their

4

different cell cycle phases at IFN treatment onset. Delays in the expression of key regulatory

5

factors have been widely observed in signal-dependent transcriptional responses and have been

6

found important for ensuring proper execution of biological functions [83-85]. Common

7

mechanisms underlying these delays include extensive nucleosome occupancy at the promoter

8

regions [86, 87] and cascades in gene expression programs [88]. The cell cycle gating revealed

9

in this study represents a new mechanism that leads to delayed induction of specific genes upon

10

stimulation. Distinct from other mechanisms, in this scenario, the cell cycle serves as a control

11

hub that connects the expression of key pathway regulators with extracellular and intracellular

12

conditions, enabling potential cross-regulation of IFN signaling by various factors. For example,

13

external serum or nutrient conditions, which influence cell cycle progression, could thereby

14

modulate USP18 expression and impact IFN responsiveness. This mode of regulation may also

15

provide a link between cell cycle stages and the effects of IFNs on cancer cells. For instance, the

16

resistance of cancer stem cells to IFN treatments may be attributed partially to the fact that they

17

spend the majority of time in G0/G1 [89], resulting in high USP18 expression and low IFN

18

responsiveness. Along the same line, a recent report showed that IFN in combination with an

19

G2/M inhibitor increased necroptosis in cancer cells [90], possibly due to delayed USP18

20

induction.

21

We acknowledge that our study only considered the control of specific ISGs, STAT1, IRF9,

22

and USP18, which play crucial regulatory roles in IFN-driven signaling. There are other

23

mechanisms that also contribute to priming or desensitization of the JAK-STAT pathway. For

24

instance, it has been recently shown that acquisition of histone H3 methylation upon IFN

25

pretreatment accelerates the recruitment of RNA polymerase II and transcription factors, leading

26

to primed transcriptional responses to re-stimulation [54]. For desensitization, the family of SOCS

27

proteins represses JAK-STAT signaling at multiple layers via various mechanisms [91],

28

constituting negative feedback loops in addition to that mediated by USP18. The coupled ISGF3-

29

USP18 feedback system revealed in this study may function together with all the other

30

mechanisms to maintain homeostasis in the responses to varying IFN signals. Further work will

31

be needed to evaluate the relative contributions of different mechanisms and how they coordinate

32

to fine-tune the IFN responsiveness.

33

Future studies will also be needed to determine the detailed mechanisms underlying the

34

cell cycle-gated regulation of USP18. Our results suggest that DNA methylation at the promoter

12

1

region may be involved in mediating the effects of cell cycle on gene expression (Fig. 5D).

2

However, more experiments will be required to directly monitor DNA methylation level over time

3

and measure its effects on chromatin modifications and the recruitments of transcription factors

4

and RNA polymerase II. Intriguingly, ISGs have a wide range of CpG site numbers, and potentially

5

methylation levels, in their promoters. Among the 278 ISGs examined, 114 genes, besides USP18,

6

have more than 100 CpG sites in their promoters (Fig. S10, A). It would be interesting to perform

7

a genome-wide analysis to see whether the cell cycle-gated regulation can be more generally

8

observed in other ISGs and how this regulatory scheme contributes to the innate immune

9

response at a global level. Furthermore, IFN-a induces proinflammatory and antiviral responses

10

in many types of cells. As our current study has focused only on epithelial cells, it would be

11

interesting for future studies to examine and compare the dynamics and regulation of IFN-driven

12

signaling and gene expression responses in other cell types, such as macrophages, dendritic

13

cells, natural killer cells, and T cells, all of which are important players in mounting innate and

14

adaptive immune responses. With specialized physiologies and functions, these cells may exhibit

15

largely distinct response dynamics and modes of regulation. A careful investigation along this

16

direction will advance our understanding about how various types of cells utilize the same set of

17

molecular pathways with different kinetics to communicate with one another and coordinate their

18

responses to infection. In addition, our study, and many recent single-cell analyses from other

19

groups [92], highlight the presence of substantial clonal heterogeneity in cellular responses to

20

signals. An open question that deserves extensive further exploration is how these cell-to-cell

21

variabilities contribute to biological functions, in vitro, and more importantly, in vivo, under

22

physiological contexts. Ongoing and future technological advances will enable us to tackle the

23

emerging questions and challenges in single-cell biology, providing a more comprehensive,

24

quantitative, and dynamic view of biological systems.

25

Finally, due to the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, there is an urgency in

26

understanding the basic biology of host response to viral infection, which may help the

27

development of clinical strategies against the disease. Latest research revealed that SARS-CoV-

28

2 is especially sensitive to type I IFNs, compared to other coronaviruses, making IFN pretreatment

29

a potential strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection [43-45]. Our findings suggested possible

30

ways to enhance the effectiveness of IFNs for future clinical use. For example, repetitive short-

31

term administrations of IFN may lead to less desensitization and a more dramatic effect than

32

prolonged treatments. Alternatively, the combined use of USP18 inhibitors with type I IFNs may

33

substantially boost the effectiveness of IFNs against SARS-CoV-2. Further studies in animal

Materials and Methods

Cell cultures

6

HeLa and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dullbecco minimal essential medium (DMEM:

7

Thermo Scientific HyClone #SH30022FS) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mM L-

8

glutamine, 100 I.U./ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin at 37°C, 5% CO2 and 90% humidity. The

9

imaging media is phenol red free DMEM (Life Technology-GibcoÒ) with identical supplements as the

10

culture medium. The transfections were performed with 1 µg DNA: 2 µl Fugene HD (Promega E2311)

11

ratio. Cells were seeded at 300,000 cells/well in 6-well plate for 18 hours before transfection. Two

12

days after transfection puromycin was added to the medium at 1 µg/ml, and cells were selected for 2

13

days. Survival cells were grown for another 7 days before sorted with FACS into 96-well and

14

expanded into monoclonal cell lines.

15
16

Drug treatments

17

Cells were treated with 100 ng/mL recombinant human IFN-a 1a (Prospec: cyt-520).

18

Lovastatin (Selleck Chemicals, S2061) was used at 5 µM and Roscovitine (Sigma-Aldrich, R7772)

19

was used at 5 µM. Decitabine (Sigma-Aldrich, A3656) was used at 100 µM.

21

Cell line construction

22

We followed the CRISPR/Cas9 protocol [93] to construct the reporter cell line. In general, the

23

gRNAs were designed by online CRISPR tool (http://crispr.mit.edu) and the DNA oligos were ordered

24

from Eurofins Genomics, annealed and cloned into pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (Addgene #48139) vector

25

plasmids. gRNA plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells and tested for gRNA efficiency using

26

the T7 endonuclease assay. Only the most efficient gRNA was used with the donor DNA. The donor

27

plasmids were constructed using Gibson assembly method. We used site-directed in-vitro

28

mutagenesis to make synonymous substitution in the donor plasmids to avoid gRNA recognition and

29

Cas9 cutting of the linearized donor.

30

In more detail, we first developed a nuclear marker cell line by inserting the nuclear localization

31

signal followed by two copies of infrared fluorescent protein (NLS-2xiRFP) [94] under the endogenous

32

actin promoter followed by a P2A spacer in HeLa cells. This cell line ensured a constitutive expression

33

without introducing exogeneous strong constitutive promoter and greatly assisted cell segmentation

and tracking. Briefly, the gRNA and the linearized donor DNA were transfected into HeLa cells and

2

the transfected cells were screened with 1 µg/ml puromycin for 2 days. The cells were allowed to

3

grow for additional 5 days before sorted by FACS. The fluorescently positive cells were sorted as

4

single cell into 96-well plate. We collected at least 500 single cells. We grew the cells for additional 3

5

weeks to obtain homogenous clones. On average, about 30% of cells formed colonies and all were

6

screen for fluorescent signal with the microscope. A minimal of 10 clones were then genotyped and

7

checked for homozygosity and correct integration using at least 3 pairs of primers and confirmed with

8

sequencing. Positive clones were further validated with western blot to ensure correct protein

9

expression. After construction and validation, the engineered single-clonal cell line was assigned a

10

unique identification number, entered in our electronic database, and stored in liquid nitrogen with a

11

cryoprotectant. The same procedure was performed for CRISPR-based tagging the additional genes,

12

STAT1, IRF9 and USP18 sequentially.

13

The knockdown of USP18 by shRNA was done using retrovirus transduction. We screened

14

the transfected cells with 1 µg/ml puromycin for 5 days and confirmed the presence of the construct

15

in the cells with PCR and confirmed the knock-down of USP18 with western blotting. Similarly, the

16

knockdown of SOCS1 by shRNA was done using lentivirus transduction, screened and validated with

17

PCR and qPCR.

18

For the cell cycle reporter cell lines, we transfected USP18 CRISPR constructs into the nuclear

19

marker cell line and screened for a correct and homogenous monoclonal clone. We then used

20

lentivirus to stably integrate pCMV-DHB-mCherry or pCMV-mCherry-Geminin(1-110)-P2A-mCitrine-

21

Cdt1(30-120) in pLenti-Puro (Addgene: 39481). Cells were screened with puromycin and sorted by

22

FACS to generate monoclonal cell lines.

Microfluidic and cell culture setup for time-lapse microscopy

27

Fabrication of the microfluidic device was conducted as described previously [52]. For setting

28

up the microfluidic experiments, HeLa cells were washed with dPBS and detached from the culture

29

dish with 0.25% trypsin EDTA, centrifuged at 200 rcf for 3 minutes and resuspended with the complete

30

imaging medium at a density of 7-10 million cells per mL. The suspension was loaded into the

31

microfluidic device and allow the cells to adhere for at least 36 hours in the standard incubator (37°C,

32

5% CO2 and 90% humidity). The detail of the loading protocol is described previously [52]. The device

33

was set up in a customized chamber with 5% CO2 and 37°C. The flow of the media was 1 ml/hour

34

and the control of the valves were done with customized Arduino board.

For experiment performed on 24-well tissue culture plate, cells were seeded at 25,000

Image acquisition

6

Time-lapse images were acquired using a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope equipped with

7

integrated Perfect-Focus (PFS), Nikon Plan Apochromat Lambda objective lens, and Evolveâ 512

8

EMCCD camera (Teledyne Photometrics). Time-lapse imaging was performed with an on-stage

9

incubator equipped with temperature control and humidified 5% CO2. Images were taken every 5

10

minutes for phase, Cy5.5 and mCherry channel and every 20 min for YFP and 30 min for CFP using

11

Nikon NES element software.

Image analysis and single-cell tracking

14

Background correction was performed using ImageJ “rolling ball” background subtraction

15

algorithm with 50-pixel radius. Nuclear segmentation was done using the nuclear marker iRFP

16

reporter and then refined by marker-based watershed and the mask was generated. The phase

17

images were used to generate masks for whole-cell segmentation. The masks were applied to other

18

channels to quantify fluorescent intensity. Single-cell segmentation, tracking and quantification were

19

performed using a custom MATLAB code developed in our lab, as described previously [95, 96].

20
21

Cell cycle phase inference

22

From the single-cell time traces, we used nuclear and cell morphology changes as markers to

23

identify each cell division, since HeLa cells become rounded and non-adherent when dividing. For

24

CDK2 activity reporter, within one cell cycle G1, S and G2 were identified based on the intensity and

25

dynamics of nuclear DHB-mCherry. Similarly, for the FUCCI reporter, G1 phase was classified as the

26

phase between the end of cell division and the time the YFP-Cdt1 signal reaches maximum. S phase

27

began as YFP-Cdt1 signal starts to decline until it intersects with mCherry-Gem1 signal. The rest of

28

the cell cycle was considered the G2 phase.

Viral replication assay

31

Cells were pretreated with 100 ng/ml IFN-a for 0, 10 or 24 hours and washed with PBS 3 times

32

followed by 8 hours of normal medium. Cells were infected by adding normal medium containing 2500

33

plaque forming units (PFU) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which corresponds to a multiplicity of

34

infection (MOI) of ~0.01. Two hours after infection, medium was replaced again with normal medium.

Computational modeling

8

Deterministic model: The simplified kinetic model of the gene regulatory network consists of two

9

species, IRF9 and USP18, and they impose positive and negative regulation to gene expression,

10

respectively. The positive regulation by IRF9 is represented by the function 𝑝𝑓:

11
12

𝑝𝑓 = 𝑘% ∙

𝐼𝑅𝐹9
𝑘+ + 𝐼𝑅𝐹9

13
14

and the negative regulation by USP18 is represented by the function 𝑛𝑓:

15
16

𝑛𝑓 =

𝑘.
𝑘. + 𝑈𝑆𝑃18

17
18

The expression of IRF9 and USP18 are both regulated by interferon (IFN) input and a combination

19

of these two functions, and are governed by the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) below:

20
21

𝑑
𝐼𝑅𝐹9 = 𝐼(𝑡) ∙ (𝑘8 + 𝑝𝑓) ∙ 𝑛𝑓
𝑑𝑡

22

𝑑
𝑈𝑆𝑃18 = 𝐼(𝑡) ∙ 𝑆9 ∙ (𝑘: + 𝑝𝑓) ∙ 𝑛𝑓
𝑑𝑡

23
24

where I(t) is the IFN input, taking either 0 or 1. 𝑆9 is a stepwise function that generates a delay in

25

USP18 upregulation:

26
27

𝑆9 = <

0, when the IFN input time < 𝜏
1, when the IFN input time ≥ 𝜏

28
29

where 𝜏 is the delay time of USP18 production.

1

Because the protein decay observed during the time scale of our experiments was very

2

modest, we considered only protein production, but not decay, to keep our model simple. We

3

used the model to quantitatively analyze the USP18 delay time. To this end, we systematically

4

assigned the value of 𝜏 to be from 1 to 20 hours, while keeping all the other parameters free. We

5

fit the model to the data for each assigned value of 𝜏. The ODEs were solved using custom

6

MATLAB code based on the basic Euler’s method with dt=0.001. Fitting was done using MATLAB

7

built-in function, lsqcurvefit. The time trace data of PIRF9-YFP reporter fluorescence under

8

sustained IFN-𝛼 stimulation (Fig. 1C) and the data from pretreatment experiments (Fig. 1F) were

9

used for the fitting. We found that the fitting error (between simulations and data) reaches the

10

minimum when 𝜏 is 8 hours (Fig. 3, B and C). The best-fit parameters are summarized in the

11

Table S4.

12

We further used the model to predict the responses to repetitive versus sustained IFN

13

inputs. In particular, we simulated the responses to a 5 x 8-hour input and a 40-hour sustained

14

input. We found that the 5 x 8-hour input induced a higher expression of IRF9 than that induced

15

by the 40-hour input, and this difference is USP18-dependent (Fig. 3, D and E). This prediction

16

was validated by experiments, as shown in Fig. 3F.

17
18

Incorporation of cell cycle regulation in the model: As described in the main text, based on

19

the experimental results in Figs. 4 and 5, we assumed that USP18 expression can be induced

20

immediately if the IFN input starts within an open window of a cell cycle and the delay time would

21

be 0. However, if the input misses the window, the cell will have to wait until the open window of

22

the next cell cycle and the delay time will equal to the waiting time. The length of a full cell cycle

23

was estimated to be 21.82 hours based on the experimental data (Fig. S4D). The model was fit

24

to the experimentally-determined distribution of USP18 delay times within a cell cycle (Fig. 6B;

25

the data from Fig. 4E) to obtain an estimate of the open window length as 7.3 hours. The

26

stochastic simulation was performed with the stochastic differential equations:

27
28

𝑑
𝐼𝑅𝐹9 = 𝐼(𝑡) ∙ (𝑘8 + 𝑝𝑓) ∙ 𝑛𝑓 + 𝜉PQRS
𝑑𝑡

29

𝑑
𝑈𝑆𝑃18 = 𝐼(𝑡) ∙ 𝑆9 (𝑘: + 𝑝𝑓) ∙ 𝑛𝑓 + 𝜉TUV%W
𝑑𝑡

30
31

in which, 𝜉PQRS and 𝜉TUV%W are white noise terms, representing expression noise for the two

32

species. Both of the two terms are Gaussian random variables with a mean of zero and the

33

standard deviations set to be 250 and 1000, respectively. The input onset times of single cells

within a cell cycle are random numbers uniformly distributed within a cell cycle between 0 to 21.82

2

hours. 𝑆9 is no longer a deterministic stepwise function with a fixed delay 𝜏, instead it is a

3

stochastic stepwise function, where the delay 𝜏 varies depending on the IFN treatment onset

4

within a cell cycle, as described above. Other parameters are the same as those listed in Table

5

S4. We simulated the single-cell responses of the pretreatment experiments with different input

6

durations. For each pretreatment condition, we performed 400 simulations where each simulation

7

represented a single cell exposed to the IFN inputs. Our simulated results were plotted as scatter
