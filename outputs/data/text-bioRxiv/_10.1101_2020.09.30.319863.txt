ABSTRACT

24

Enveloped viruses, including influenza A viruses (IAVs) and coronaviruses (CoVs), utilize the

25

host cell secretory pathway to synthesize viral glycoproteins and direct them to sites of assembly.

26

Using an image-based high-content screen, we identified two thiopurines, 6-thioguanine (6-TG)

27

and 6-thioguanosine (6-TGo), that selectively disrupted the processing and accumulation of IAV

28

glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Selective disruption of IAV

29

glycoprotein processing and accumulation by 6-TG and 6-TGo correlated with unfolded protein

30

response (UPR) activation and HA accumulation could be partially restored by the chemical

31

chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA). Chemical inhibition of the integrated stress response (ISR)

32

restored accumulation of NA monomers in the presence of 6-TG or 6-TGo, but did not restore

33

NA glycosylation or oligomerization. Thiopurines inhibited replication of the human coronavirus

34

OC43 (HCoV-OC43), which also correlated with UPR/ISR activation and diminished

35

accumulation of ORF1ab and nucleocapsid (N) mRNAs and N protein, which suggests broader

36

disruption of coronavirus gene expression in ER-derived cytoplasmic compartments. The

37

chemically similar thiopurine 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) had little effect on the UPR and did not

38

affect IAV or HCoV-OC43 replication. Consistent with reports on other CoV Spike (S) proteins,

39

ectopic expression of SARS-CoV-2 S protein caused UPR activation. 6-TG treatment inhibited

40

accumulation of full length S0 or furin-cleaved S2 fusion proteins, but spared the S1 ectodomain.

41

DBeQ, which inhibits the p97 AAA-ATPase required for retrotranslocation of ubiquitinated

42

misfolded proteins during ER-associated degradation (ERAD) restored accumulation of S0 and

43

S2 proteins in the presence of 6-TG, suggesting that 6-TG induced UPR accelerates ERAD-

44

mediated turnover of membrane-anchored S0 and S2 glycoproteins. Taken together, these data

45

indicate that 6-TG and 6-TGo are effective host-targeted antivirals that trigger the UPR and

46

disrupt accumulation of viral glycoproteins. Importantly, our data demonstrate for the first time

47

the efficacy of these thiopurines in limiting IAV and HCoV-OC43 replication in cell culture

48

models.

IMPORTANCE

51

Secreted and transmembrane proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where

52

they are folded and modified prior to transport. During infection, many viruses burden the ER with

53

the task of creating and processing viral glycoproteins that will ultimately be incorporated into

54

viral envelopes. Some viruses refashion the ER into replication compartments where viral gene

55

expression and genome replication take place. This viral burden on the ER can trigger the cellular

56

unfolded protein response (UPR), which attempts to increase the protein folding and processing

57

capacity of the ER to match the protein load. Much remains to be learned about how viruses co-

58

opt the UPR to ensure efficient synthesis of viral glycoproteins. Here, we show that two FDA-

59

approved thiopurine drugs, 6-TG and 6-TGo, induce the UPR in a manner that impedes viral

60

glycoprotein accumulation for enveloped influenza viruses and coronaviruses. These drugs may

61

impede the replication of viruses that require precise tuning of the UPR to support viral

62

glycoprotein synthesis for the successful completion of a replication cycle.

INTRODUCTION

65

Enveloped viruses encode integral membrane proteins that are synthesized and post-

66

translationally modified in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) prior to transport to sites of virion

67

assembly. When ER protein folding capacity is exceeded, the accumulation of unfolded proteins

68

in the ER causes activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) whereby activating

69

transcription factor-6 (ATF6), inositol requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1) and PKR-like endoplasmic

70

reticulum kinase (PERK) sense ER stress and trigger the synthesis of basic leucine zipper (bZIP)

71

transcription factors that initiate a transcriptional response (1). UPR gene expression causes the

72

accumulation of proteins that attempt to restore ER proteostasis by expanding ER folding capacity

73

and stimulating catabolic activities like ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (2). ERAD ensures

74

that integral membrane proteins that fail to be properly folded are ubiquitinated and

75

retrotranslocated out of the ER for degradation in the 26S proteasome. There is accumulating

76

evidence that bursts of viral glycoprotein synthesis can burden ER protein folding machinery, and

77

that enveloped viruses subvert the UPR to promote efficient viral replication (3, 4).

78

Influenza A viruses (IAVs) encode three integral membrane proteins: hemagglutinin (HA)

79

neuraminidase (NA) and matrix protein 2 (M2). HA adopts a type I transmembrane topology in

80

the ER, followed by addition of N-linked glycans, disulfide bond formation, and trimerization prior

81

to transport to the Golgi and further processing by proteases and glycosyltransferases (5–11); NA

82

adopts a type II transmembrane topology in the ER, is similarly processed by glycosyltransferases

83

and protein disulfide isomerases, and assembles into tetramers prior to traversing the secretory

84

pathway to the cell surface (12, 13). The small M2 protein also forms disulfide-linked tetramers in

85

the ER, which is a prerequisite for viroporin activity (14–16). IAV replication causes selective

86

activation of the UPR; IRE1 is activated, but PERK and ATF6 are not (17), although the precise

87

mechanisms of regulation remain unknown. Furthermore, chemical chaperones and selective

88

chemical inhibition of IRE1 activity inhibit IAV replication, suggesting that IRE1 has pro-viral

89

effects. HA is sufficient to activate the UPR (18) and is subject to ERAD-mediated degradation

90

(19). By contrast, little is known about how NA and M2 proteins affect the UPR.

91

Several coronaviruses (CoVs) have been shown to activate the UPR, including infectious

92

bronchitis virus (IBV) (20, 21), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (22), transmissible gastroenteritis

93

virus (TGEV) (23), human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43 (24) and SARS-CoV-1 (25–27). However,

94

proximal UPR sensor activation does not always elicit downstream UPR transcription responses

95

during CoV replication (28), which suggests complex regulation of the UPR by certain CoVs. The

96

coronavirus structural proteins Spike (S), Envelope (E) and Membrane (M) are synthesized in the

97

ER as transmembrane glycoproteins (29). S is heavily modified by N-glycosylation in the ER,

98

which promotes proper folding and trimerization (30). Ectopic expression of S proteins from MHV

99

(22), HCoV-HKU1 (31) and SARS-CoV-1 (26, 31) have all been shown to be sufficient for UPR

100

activation in cell culture. Additional transmembrane CoV proteins have been shown to be

101

sufficient to induce the UPR, including SARS-CoV-1 non-structural protein 6 (nsp6) (32), ORF3a

102

(33) and ORF8ab (34) proteins. CoVs rearrange ER membranes into a complex reticulovesicular

103

network that includes double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) (35). Precise roles for these

104

compartments remain incompletely understood, but multispanning transmembrane proteins nsp3,

105

nsp4 and nsp6 are thought to physically anchor CoV replication/transcription complexes (RTCs)

106

to these membranes (36, 37), and the N-glycosylation of nsp3 and nsp4 indicates the ER origin of

107

DMVs. The observation of UPR gene products ER degradation-enhancing alpha-mannosidase-like

108

protein 1 (EDEM1) and osteosarcoma amplified 9 (OS-9) in DMVs provides additional linkage

109

between CoV RTCs and ER proteostasis mechanisms (38). Following replication, CoVs complete

110

the assembly and egress process by budding into the ER-Golgi Intermediate Compartment

111

(ERGIC) and traversing the secretory pathway. Thus, multiple stages of CoV infection are

112

dependent on the ER.

113

Viral mRNAs are decoded by the host protein synthesis machinery, which could make

114

them vulnerable to stress-induced regulation of protein synthesis. In addition to ER stress-mediated

115

activation of PERK, three other sentinel kinases (protein kinase R (PKR); heme-regulated

116

translation inhibitor (HRI); general control non-derepressible-2 (GCN2)) respond to diverse

117

stresses by phosphorylating eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha (eIF2) and enforcing

118

a translation initiation checkpoint (39). The assembly of the ternary complex, comprised of eIF2,

119

GTP and tRNAimet is essential for incorporation of tRNAimet into the 40S ribosomal subunit during

120

translation initiation. Phosphorylated eIF2 binds to the eIF2B guanine nucleotide exchange factor

121

and prevents it from exchanging GTP for GDP and recharging the ternary complex (40). This

122

integrated stress response (ISR) stalls bulk protein synthesis at the initiation step and causes the

123

accumulation of 48S preinitiation complexes and associated mRNAs that are bound by

124

aggregation-prone RNA-binding proteins, including Ras-GAP SH3 domain-binding protein

125

(G3BP), T-cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1), and TIA-1 related protein (TIAR). These

126

complexes nucleate cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs), sites where stalled messenger

127

ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes are triaged until stress is resolved and protein synthesis can

128

resume (41, 42). Thus, ISR activation threatens efficient viral protein synthesis and causes the

129

formation of antiviral SGs that impede efficient viral replication. Many viruses have acquired the

130

means to prevent translation arrest and SG formation, and thereby limit the negative impact of ISR

131

on viral protein synthesis.

132

We previously demonstrated that IAV suppresses SG formation in infected cells (43) and

133

encodes three proteins with SG-suppressing activity; non-structural protein 1 (NS1), nucleoprotein

134

(NP) and polymerase acidic X (PA-X) (43, 44). Treatment of IAV infected cells with protein

135

synthesis inhibitors Pateamine A and Silvestrol caused SG formation and impeded IAV replication

136

by inhibiting accumulation of viral proteins and downstream viral genome replication (44, 45).

137

However, these inhibitors triggered SG formation and cytotoxic effects in uninfected cells as well,

138

limiting their potential utility as antivirals. Because SG formation correlates with antiviral activity,

139

we conducted an image-based high-content screen to identify molecules that selectively induce

140

SG formation in IAV infected cells. We identified two FDA-approved thiopurine analogs, 6-

141

thioguanine (6-TG) and 6-thioguanosine (6-TGo), that blocked IAV and HCoV-OC43 replication

142

in a dose-dependent manner. Unlike Pateamine A and Silvestrol, these thiopurines selectively

143

disrupted the processing and accumulation of viral glycoproteins, which correlated with UPR

144

activation. Synthesis of viral glycoproteins could be partially restored in 6-TG treated cells by the

145

chemical inhibition of the UPR or ISR. Our data suggest that UPR-inducing molecules could be

146

effective host-targeted antivirals against viruses that depend on ER processes to support efficient

147

replication. Induction of UPR by 6-TG and 6-TGo represents a novel host-directed antiviral

148

mechanism triggered by these drugs and reveals a previously unrecognized unique mechanism of

149

action that distinguishes them from other closely related thiopurines and nucleoside analogues.

152

Thiopurine analogs 6-TG and 6-TGo selectively induce SGs in IAV infected cells.

153

To identify molecules that selectively induce antiviral SG formation in IAV infected cells

154

without inducing SGs in uninfected cells, we developed an image-based high-content screen.

155

Clonal A549[EGFP-G3BP1] cells (43) that stably express the core SG protein G3BP1 fused to

156

enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were selected because they display rapid and uniform

157

SG formation in response to known SG-inducing molecules (e.g. Silvestrol). We screened >50,000

158

small molecules from the Prestwick, Sigma LOPAC, and Chembridge DiverSet collections. After

159

seeding on 96-well plates overnight, cells were infected with IAV strain A/Udorn/1972(H3N2)

160

(IAV-Udorn) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. At 4 hours post-infection (hpi) cells were

161

treated with small molecules for four additional hours prior to fixation and staining with Hoechst

162

33342 to label nuclei. Images were automatically acquired from two channels (to detect Hoechst

163

and EGFP-G3BP) per field and 15 fields per well of each 96-well plate using a Cellomics Array

164

Scan VTI microscope and processed to yield values for punctate EGFP-G3BP1 intensity that

165

reflected SG formation.

166

Through this screen, we identified two thiopurines, 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and 6-

167

thioguanosine (6-TGo) (Fig. 1A), that triggered dose-dependent SG formation in IAV-infected

168

cells (Fig. 1B). Specifically, SGs formed in approximately 10 % of 6-TG-treated or 6-TGo-treated

169

infected cells; no SGs were detected in mock infected cells treated with either drug at the highest

170

concentration (Fig. 1B). These findings were confirmed in parental A549 cells infected with IAV

171

strain A/California/07/2009 (H1N1; IAV-CA/07); 6-TG treated cells displayed the formation of

172

foci that contained SG constituent proteins G3BP1 and poly A binding protein (PABP) (Fig. 1C).

173

These foci also contained canonical SG proteins TIAR and eIF3A (Fig. 1D), supporting their

174

identity as bona fide SGs.

175

Thiopurine analogs inhibit IAV replication

176

Next, we wanted to determine whether thiopurine-mediated SG formation indicated a

177

disruption of viral replication. A549 cells were infected with IAV strain A/PuertoRico/8/1934

178

(H1N1; IAV-PR8) and treated with 6-TG, 6-TGo or controls at 1 hpi. Cell supernatants were

179

harvested at 24 hpi and infectious virions enumerated by plaque assay. Despite SG induction in

180

only a fraction of virus-infected cells, we observed a sharp dose-dependent decrease in virion

181

production following treatment with either thiopurine analog. Treatment with 2 M 6-TG reduced

182

virion production by ~10-fold, whereas 2 M 6-TGo reduced virion production by ~100-fold (Fig.
6

183

2A). Furthermore, treatment of IAV infected cells with 10 µM concentrations of either 6-TG or 6-

184

TGo led to even greater inhibition of IAV production (Fig. 2A). This suggests that SG formation

185

correlates with the disruption of the viral replication cycle. However, the sharp decrease in

186

infectious virion production in 6-TG/6-TGo-treated cells suggests that SG formation is not

187

required for their antiviral effect. The nucleoside analog 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) had no effect on

188

IAV replication at 2 M and 10 M doses (Fig. 2A). Using an alamarBlue assay, we observed a

189

~30% reduction in A549 cell viability in the presence of 10 M doses of 6-TG/6-TGo (Fig. 2B).

190

Compared to SG-inducing translation inhibitor Silvestrol, which causes apoptosis in A549 cells

191

upon prolonged exposure, we did not observe significant disruption of cell monolayer by 6-TG

192

treatment (Fig. 2C) or induction of apoptosis as measured by PARP cleavage (Fig. 2D). This is

193

consistent with a recent report of 6-TG-mediated cytostatic rather than cytotoxic effects on A549

194

cells (46). In Vero cells, 6-TG treatment partially protected cellular monolayers from IAV-induced

195

cell death over 72-h incubation (Fig. 2E). Taken together, our data suggest that 6-TG and 6-TGo

196

elicit a broad dose-dependent antiviral effect against IAV that was not shared by the nucleoside

197

analog 5-FU.

198

6-TG treatment inhibits HA and NA glycoprotein processing and accumulation without

199

affecting viral transcription

200

Next, we compared accumulation of viral proteins in control cells and cells treated with

201

thiopurines and 5-FU (Fig. 3A). We previously observed that SG-inducing eIF4A inhibitors

202

broadly affected synthesis of IAV proteins and blocked progression through the replication cycle

203

by preventing the ‘switch’ of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) from transcription to

204

genome replication (45). By contrast, treatment of IAV-PR8 infected cells with 6-TG and 6-TGo

205

selectively blocked the processing and accumulation of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase

206

(NA) glycoproteins without affecting the accumulation of nucleoprotein (NP). Accumulation of

207

matrix protein 1 (M1) was affected by higher doses of 6-TG and 6-TGo, but to a much lesser extent

208

than HA and NA (Fig. 3A). For NA, 6-TG and 6-TGo caused a dose-dependent accumulation of

209

faster-migrating species, reminiscent of treatment with the inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation,

210

tunicamycin (TM). For HA, 6-TG and 6-TGo likewise caused dose-dependent accumulation of

211

faster-migrating, presumably un-glycosylated species, but these were difficult to visualize as they

212

migrated to the same position as NP on immunoblots probed with polyclonal anti-IAV antibodies

213

that concurrently detect NP, M1 and HA. 5-FU, which had no effect on viral replication over the

214

24 h time course in these cells (Fig. 2A), likewise had no effect on the accumulation of these IAV

215

proteins (Fig. 3A). Consistent with the notion of selective inhibition of IAV glycoprotein synthesis

216

and maturation, we observed that 6-TG had no effect on the accumulation of IAV-PR8 HA or NA

217

transcripts or function of the RdRp in genome replication, as 6-TG had little effect on the

218

accumulation of HA and NA genome segments (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these data support a

219

novel mechanism of action for thiopurine analogs in selectively inhibiting processing and

220

accumulation of IAV glycoproteins and significantly impairing IAV replication.

221

6-TG and 6-TGo activate the UPR and chemical mitigation of ER stress restores synthesis of

222

HA glycoproteins

223

By inhibiting N-linked glycosylation, TM impedes proper processing of secreted and

224

transmembrane proteins in the lumen of the ER, which elicits ER stress and activates the UPR

225

(47). Indeed, we observed that TM treatment of A549 cells caused accumulation of XBP1s and

226

the ER chaperone binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) (Fig. 4A). BiP upregulation is an

227

excellent measure for UPR activation because it requires both ATF6(N)-dependent transcription

228

of BiP and PERK-mediated activation of the ISR and uORF-skipping-dependent translation (1).

229

We observed that both 6-TG and 6-TGo caused BiP and XBP1s accumulation in A549 cells,

230

whereas the chemically similar thiopurine 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) did not. Nucleoside analogs

231

5-FU and ribavirin also did not affect BiP or XBP1s levels (Fig. 4A). These data demonstrate that

232

6-TG and 6-TGo, but not all thiopurines, activate the UPR in A549 cells.

233

To determine whether thiopurines could activate the UPR during IAV infection, A549 cells

234

infected with IAV-PR8 were treated with 6-TG. We observed that 6-TG caused strong

235

accumulation of BiP which coincided with diminished accumulation of HA (Fig. 4B). By contrast,

236

co-administration of 6-TG and the chemical chaperone 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) (48) diminished

237

accumulation of BiP and partially restored HA levels in infected cells, without affecting levels of

238

NP and M1 proteins. This suggests that thiopurine-mediated activation of the UPR/ISR is at least

239

partially responsible for the diminished accumulation of HA glycoproteins in infected cells.

240

To corroborate our observation of 6-TG-mediated UPR activation, A549 cells were mock

241

infected or IAV-PR8 infected, and treated with 6-TG, 6-MP, or TM for 24 h before harvesting

242

RNA for RT-qPCR analysis of UPR gene expression. We analyzed transcripts produced from

243

target genes linked to each arm of the UPR; ATF4 target gene CHOP, XBP1s target genes EDEM1

244

and ERdj4, and ATF6(N) target genes BiP and HERPUD1. As expected, TM treatment caused

245

strong induction of all 3 arms of the UPR and increased transcription of all five target genes in

246

mock-infected cells and infected cells alike (Fig. 4C). This strong and consistent transcriptional

247

output between mock-infected and infected cells suggests that the UPR remains largely intact

248

during IAV-PR8 infection. Treatment with 6-MP had little effect on UPR gene expression (Fig.

249

4C). By contrast, 6-TG treatment caused statistically significant increases in transcription from all

250

five UPR target genes (Fig. 4C). These observations confirm that 6-TG activates all three arms of

251

the UPR, whereas the chemically similar thiopurine 6-MP does not.

252

Inhibition of the integrated stress response does not restore NA processing and

253

oligomerization in 6-TG treated cells

254

IAV glycoproteins are translocated into the ER, where they are modified with N-linked

255

glycans and organize into oligomeric complexes. Upon synthesis in the ER, the type II

256

transmembrane protein NA is glycosylated and forms dimers linked by intermolecular disulfide

257

bonds in the stalk region (13) that then assemble into tetramers (49). We investigated the effect of

258

6-TG on NA processing and oligomerization using SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting procedures in the

259

presence or absence of the disulfide bond reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT). Since NA tetramers

260

are known to dissociate into dimers during electrophoresis (12, 50) we annotated the ~120 kDa

261

band as dimers/tetramers (Fig. 5A). We observed intact glycosylated NA dimers/tetramers and

262

monomers in mock-treated IAV-PR8-infected cells, which were resolved into ~60 kDa

263

glycosylated NA monomers in the presence of DTT (Fig. 5A). Unglycosylated NA monomers

264

were undetectable in mock-treated cells at steady state, confirming that N-glycosylation is a rapid

265

initial step in NA processing in the ER. TM treatment eliminated NA dimers/tetramers, leaving a

266

minor fraction of unglycosylated NA monomers. The 6-TG treatment diminished accumulation of

267

all forms of NA, yielding a distinct residual band that migrated closer to the size of the

268

unglycosylated NA monomers from TM-treated cells; this suggests that 6-TG treatment interferes

269

with proper N-glycosylation of nascent NA. Treatment with Integrated Stress Response Inhibitor

270

(ISRIB), which prevents ISR-mediated translation arrest by maintaining eIF2B activity (51, 52),

271

rescued accumulation of NA monomers in both TM- and 6-TG-treated cells. However, ISRIB was

272

not able to restore NA glycosylation and oligomerization. These data provide further evidence that

273

6-TG inhibits IAV glycoprotein accumulation via UPR/ISR activation and extends our

274

understanding by demonstrating that ISR suppression does not fully reverse these effects. This is

275

further supported by our observations that administration of ISRIB alone had no impact on IAV

276

replication while co-administration of ISRIB with TM- or 6-TG failed to restore virion production

277

in single-cycle infection assays (Fig. 5B).

278

6-TG and 6-TGo inhibit HCoV-OC43 replication

279

In vitro studies have shown that thiopurines 6-TG and 6-MP can reversibly inhibit SARS-

280

CoV-1 and MERS-CoV papain-like cysteine proteases PL(pro) (53–55); however, whether these

281

thiopurines could inhibit viral replication was not assessed. Our observations of UPR activation

282

and selective inhibition of IAV HA and NA processing and accumulation by low micromolar doses

283

of 6-TG and 6TGo, but not 6-MP, suggest a distinct antiviral mechanism of action for these

284

thiopurines. If true, the antiviral activity of 6-TG and 6-TGo may be broadly applicable to other

285

viruses with envelope glycoproteins like coronaviruses. To test this directly, we performed HCoV-

286

OC43 replication assays in human colorectal tumor-8 (HCT-8) cells in the presence of 2 M and

287

10 M doses of 6-TG, 6-TGo and 6-MP, with TM serving as a strong UPR-inducing positive

288

control. At 24 h, cell-free and cell-associated virus was collected and combined and titered by

289

TCID50 in Baby Hamster Kidney-21 (BHK-21) cells. We observed strong, dose-dependent

290

inhibition of HCoV-OC43 replication in the presence of 6-TG and 6-TGo resulting in a >10-fold

291

reduction in viral titre, whereas 6-MP had minimal effects (Fig. 6A). As expected, TM also

292

potently inhibited HCoV-OC43 replication. Similar to A549 cells, HCT-8 cell viability was

293

minimally affected by the thiopurines at concentrations at or below 10 µM (Fig. 6B). Consistent

294

with the strong effect on infectious virion production, we also observed significant, dose-

295

dependent reductions in viral protein accumulation due to 6-TG and 6-TGo treatment in HCoV-

296

OC43-infected HCT-8 cells (Fig. 6C, the main band recognized by the anti-OC43 antibody is

297

consistent with the size of the nucleocapsid N protein). Treatment with higher dose of 6-MP caused

298

detectable decline in N protein levels in HCoV-OC43-infected cells, but not to the levels observed

299

with 6-TG or 6-TGo treatment (Fig. 6C). In HCoV-OC43-infected HCT-8 cells, BiP and CHOP

300

expression was upregulated following thiopurine treatment (Fig. 6C). This is consistent with the

301

significant induction of BiP proten and CHOP mRNA levels that was observed in thiopurine-

302

treated A549 cells (Fig. 4C). To test the effects of 6-TG on CoV replication, we analysed HCoV-

303

OC43 mRNA synthesis by harvesting RNA from infected cells treated with 6-TG or vehicle

304

control. We observed that 6-TG treatment caused significant decreases in steady-state levels of (+)

305

genomic RNA (ORF1ab) as well as (+) subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) that encodes N (Fig. 6D).

306

Thus, despite the previously reported effects of 6-TG and 6-MP on HCoV cysteine protease

307

activity in vitro, we observed that 6-MP had only modest effects on HCoV-OC43 replication

308

whereas 6-TG and 6-TGo had clear antiviral effects similar to our previous observations of

309

inhibition of IAV replication. Thiopurine antiviral activity in our HCoV-OC43 infection assays

310

correlated with UPR activation and hampered viral genome synthesis and viral protein production.

311

6-TG inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein accumulation via UPR activation

312

Because 6-TG activates the UPR/ISR and inhibits the processing and accumulation of IAV

313

glycoproteins, we reasoned that coronavirus glycoproteins would be similarly affected by 6-TG

314

treatment. Due to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, numerous reagents and constructs have

315

been rapidly developed to study this virus, including expression plasmids. We therefore sought to

316

determine if SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein is sensitive to 6-TG in ectopic expression experiments.

317

S is first translated as full-length S0 proprotein, before cleavage to S1 and S2 domains by cellular

318

proprotein convertases like furin (56). We observed that the S protein co-localised with the ER

319

marker calnexin when expressed alone or co-expressed with M protein (Fig. 7A). M also caused

320

some of the S protein to accumulate in distinct regions of the cytoplasm proximal to, but not

321

overlapping with, calnexin-stained ER, which likely represents the ERGIC (Fig. 7A). Ectopic

322

expression of S led to accumulation of ~230 kDa full-length N-glycosylated S0 monomers;

323

detection of ~110 kDa S1 ectodomains demonstrated efficient S N-glycosylation and trimerization

324

in the ER and transport to the Golgi for furin cleavage (Fig. 7B). We observed that ectopic S

325

expression was sufficient to activate the UPR/ISR, as indicated by accumulation of BiP (Fig. 7B),

326

consistent with previous reports of SARS-CoV-1 S (26, 31). 6-TG causes a loss of membrane-

327

bound S0 and S2, but spared the cleaved S1 subunit (Fig 7B). Co-expression of S with M altered

328

S processing leading to different accumulation of S1 protein species, possibly due to altered S

329

trafficking by M and retention at the ERGIC compartment (57). PNGase F treatment of the lysates

330

to remove N-glycosylations confirmed that M and 6-TG altered glycosylation of S, but did not

331

affect cleavage (Fig. 7C). Treatment with either the chemical chaperone 4PBA or DBeQ, a

332

selective chemical inhibitor of the p97 AAA-ATPase, led to partial restoration of S0 and S2 (Fig

333

7D). Together, these observations suggest that like IAV glycoproteins, SARS-CoV-2 S

glycoprotein is vulnerable to 6-TG mediated activation of the UPR/ISR and suggest a mechanism

335

involving accelerated turnover of membrane-anchored S0 and S2 proteins by ERAD.

336
337

DISCUSSION

338

Compared to current direct-acting antiviral drugs, effective host-targeting antivirals may

339

provide a higher barrier to the emergence of antiviral drug-resistant viruses. However, it remains

340

challenging to identify cellular pathways that can be targeted to disrupt viral replication without

341

causing adverse effects on bystander uninfected cells. Here, we report that two chemically similar

342

FDA-approved thiopurine analogues, 6-TG and 6-TGo, have broad antiviral effects that result

343

from activation of UPR and disruption of viral glycoprotein synthesis and maturation. Importantly,

344

our data demonstrate for the first time that 6-TG and 6-TGo are effective antivirals against

345

influenza virus and coronavirus and may be effective against other glycoprotein-containing

346

viruses. 6-TG is currently used in clinical settings to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia and other

347

hematologic malignancies, with the main mechanism of action involving conversion into

348

thioguanine nucleotides and subsequent incorporation into cellular DNA, which preferentially kills

349

cycling cancer cells (58, 59). Furthermore, the active 6-TG metabolite, 6-thioguanosine 5′-

350

triphosphate, was shown to inhibit small GTPase Rac1 (60), which is believed to be largely

351

responsible for anti-inflammatory effects of 6-TG in treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)

352

(61). Finally, 6-TG and closely related thiopurine 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) were demonstrated to

353

have in vitro effects against SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV as reversible, slow-binding inhibitors

354

of papain-like cysteine protease PL(pro) (53–55). Here, we demonstrate for the first time that 6-

355

TG and 6-TGo, but not 6-MP or other nucleoside analogues (5-FU, ribavirin), induce the UPR in

356

human cell lines. Selective disruption of viral glycoprotein accumulation in IAV-infected cells

357

with minimal effects on other viral proteins suggests that UPR induction by 6-TG and 6-TGo is

358

the main antiviral mechanism. Indeed, chemical chaperones and the ISR inhibitor ISRIB partially

359

restored IAV HA, NA, and SARS-CoV-2 S protein accumulation in cells treated with 6-TG.

360

Inhibition of the ERAD pathway with DBeQ also restored accumulation of ER membrane-

361

anchored subunits of SARS-CoV-2 S protein (uncleaved precursor S0 and cleaved S2) in 6-TG-

362

treated cells. This indicates that the 6-TG-induced UPR causes both the phospho-eIF2a dependent

363

decrease in viral glycoprotein mRNA translation and the ERAD-mediated degradation of newly

364

synthesized ER-anchored proteins. In the case of IAV which replicates in the nucleus of infected

365

cells, depletion of viral envelope glycoproteins blocks infectious virion production but minimally

366

affects replication of viral nucleic acids. By contrast, synthesis of coronavirus genomic RNA is

367

inhibited by thiopurine-induced UPR. This reduction could be due to inhibition of PL(pro) activity

368

as previously suggested (53–55); however, we suggest that thiopurines likely inhibit viral

369

replication due to its occurrence on the multivesicular network generated from virus-rearranged

370

ER membranes which may be highly sensitive to UPR-induced alterations.

371

Our analyses of IAV-infected cells did not detect induction of UPR when high levels of

372

viral glycoproteins HA and NA accumulated at later times post-infection. Many viruses have

373

mechanisms to interfere with different arms of the UPR, presumably to maximize the production

374

and trafficking of viral glycoproteins, and IAV was shown to inhibit activation of PERK and ATF6

375

(17). Downstream, IAV blocks new host mRNA processing and protein synthesis through host

376

shutoff mechanisms mediated by viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and polymerase acidic X

377

(PA-X) proteins. Despite these viral mechanisms of suppression of host stress responses, 6-TG

378

treatment elicited similar levels of UPR in both infected and uninfected cells, as measured by

379

transcriptional induction of genes downstream of all three arms of UPR and accumulation of BiP

380

protein. Thus, in our system it appears that 6-TG circumvents viral mechanisms of UPR

381

suppression.

382

Despite multiple mechanisms deployed by IAV to block SG formation, 6-TG and 6-TGo

383

treatment induced SGs in infected cells, which allowed us to identify these molecules in our image-

384

based screen. We previously reported that in A549 cells, IAV inhibited SG formation triggered by

385

treatment with thapsigargin, a potent inducer of ER stress, with only 9% of infected cells forming

386

SGs compared to 35% of mock-infected cells (44). Thus, induction of SGs in approximately 10%

387

of infected cells by 6-TG and 6-TGo treatment appears consistent with our previous observations.

388

However, unlike thapsigargin, 6-TG and 6-TGo did not trigger SG formation in uninfected cells.

389

The levels of UPR induction by these drugs were similar between infected and uninfected cells,

390

highlighting that in IAV-infected cells SG formation may not be triggered exclusively by ER stress

391

and PERK activation and may only partially contribute to antiviral effects of thiopurines. Indeed,

392

SGs formed in a fraction of infected cells while accumulation of viral glycoproteins HA and NA

393

was nearly completely blocked by 6-TG and 6-TGo.

394

Consistent with previous reports, ectopic expression of SARS-CoV-2 S protein was

395

enhanced during M co-expression and S alone was sufficient to trigger ER stress. In this system,

396

6-TG treatment further potentiated UPR responses, as measured by increased BiP accumulation.

397

Our data also highlight the sensitivity of membrane anchored viral proteins to 6-TG treatment. It

398

is currently unknown if host glycoproteins will be similarly affected by 6-TG treatment, but this

399

is an important question to answer due to the prevalent use of thiopurines clinically. While we

400

suspect that 6-TG and 6-TGo will be effective against a wide-range of enveloped viruses, our

401

future studies will investigate if SARS-CoV-2 replication can be negatively impacted following

402

thiopurine treatment. In the midst of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, repurposing FDA-

403

approved medications as host-targeted antivirals has the potential to positively impact our

404

treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). However, further studies in cell culture

405

models of SARS-CoV-2 infection are necessary prior to considering clinical studies.

406

What is the mechanism of UPR induction by 6-TG and 6-TGo? Our results suggest that

407

the effects are unlikely to be mediated through DNA or RNA incorporation of 6-TG because 1)

408

replicative stress does not specifically induce UPR; 2) among viral proteins, glycoprotein

409

accumulation and processing was preferentially disrupted; 3) messenger RNA levels of HA and

410

NA were not affected. Furthermore, the closely related thiopurine 6-MP that can be converted

411

into 6-thioguanosine triphosphate and incorporated into nucleic acids did not induce UPR and

412

had no effect on IAV glycoproteins or OC43 replication. Another nucleoside analogue, 5-FU,

413

that is also incorporated into nucleic acids and can even trigger SG formation upon prolonged

414

48-hour incubation (62), was similarly inactive in our assays. The second previously described

415

antiviral mechanism of action of 6-TG and 6-MP that involves direct inhibition of viral cysteine

416

proteases is similarly unlikely to have major contribution to the observed phenotypes because

417

UPR induction was triggered in both infected and uninfected cells and because, as mentioned

418

above, 6-MP was not active in our assays. Thus, by process of elimination, we speculate that the

419

mechanism of UPR induction by 6-TG and 6-TGo could involve GTPase inhibition. Numerous

420

GTPases regulate ER homeostasis, including Rab GTPases that govern vesicular trafficking

421

events and dynamin-like GTPases that regulate homotypic ER membrane fusion events required

422

for the maintenance of branched tubular networks (63). Future studies will focus on identifying

423

specific molecular targets of these UPR-inducing thiopurines using orthogonal biochemical and

424

genetic screens.

Human coronavirus infections and quantitation

460

Stocks of human coronavirus OC43 (hCoV-OC43; ATCC, VR-1558) were propagated in Vero

461

cells. To generate OC43 stocks, Vero cells were infected at a MOI of 0.05 for 1 h at 33°C in serum-

462

free DMEM. After 1 h, the inoculum was removed, and the infected cells were maintained in

463

DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin/100 µg/mL of streptomycin, and 2

464

mM L-glutamine (hCoV infection medium) for five days at 33°C. Upon harvest, the culture

465

supernatant was centrifuged at 1000 x g for 5 min at 4°C, aliquoted, and stored at -80°C. Viral

466

titers were enumerated by median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) in BHK-21 cells.

467

To test the effect of the indicated compounds on hCoV-OC43 replication, HCT-8 cells

468

were infected with hCoV-OC43 at a MOI of 0.1 for 1 h at 33°C with the virus diluted in serum-

469

free DMEM. After 1 h, the inoculum was removed, replaced with hCoV infection medium

470

supplemented with DMSO or drug at the indicated concentration where indicated, and maintained

471

at 33°C. At 24 hours post-infection, the infected cells were scraped into the culture medium and

472

stored at -70°C. The samples were thawed on ice and mixed thoroughly by pipetting. To titre

473

hCoV-OC43, TCID50 assays in BHK-21 cells were used. 50 µL of serially diluted inoculums were

474

added to BHK-21 cells seeded into 96-well plates for 1 h at 37°C. Inoculums were removed and

475

replaced with 200 uL of hCoV infection medium and incubated for five days at 37°C. After five

476

days, the culture medium was removed, the cells washed once with PBS, fixed with 100%

Fig 4. 6-TG and 6-TGo activate the UPR and chemical mitigation of ER stress
restores synthesis of HA glycoproteins. (A) A549 cells were treated with 6-thioguanine
(6-TG), 6-thioguanosine (6-TGo), 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or
ribavirin at the indicated concentrations for 6 h (XBP1s) or 24 h (BiP) prior to harvesting
lysates for immunoblotting. 5 µg/ml tunicamycin (TM) served as positive control for UPR
activation, whereas DMSO was mock treatment. Membranes were probed with anti-BiP
and anti-XBP1s antibodies to measure UPR activation. -actin served as a loading control.
(B) A549 cells were mock-infected or infected with IAV-PR8 at MOI of 1. After 1 h, cells
were washed and incubated with 20 µM 6-TG or vehicle control, with or without 10 mM
4PBA, a chemical chaperone. At 20 hpi, cell lysates were harvested and probed with
antibodies for the indicated target proteins. Western blots are representative of 3
independent experiments. (C) A549 cells were infected with IAV-PR8 at MOI of 1, washed
and overlaid with media containing 6-MP, 6-TG, or TM. Cell lysates were collected at 24
hpi and RNA was isolated and processed for RT-qPCR. Changes in CHOP, BiP, EDEM1,
ERdj4, and HERPUD1 mRNA levels were calculated by the ΔΔCt method and normalized
using 18S rRNA as a reference gene and standardized to mock. Error bars represent the
standard deviation between biological replicates (N=3); Circles represent biological
replicates; Lines represents the average value. Statistical significance was calculated via a
two-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett multiple comparisons test.

Fig. 7. 6TG causes loss of membrane-bound SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein via ERAD.
(A) 293T cells seeded on coverglass and transfected with SARS-CoV-2 Spike or 2x-streptagged Membrane (M-Strep) or empty vector. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
the following day and stained as indicated. Images captured on Leica SP8, maximum
intensity projections are depicted. (B) 293T cells were transfected as in (A) then treated
with 10 µM of 6TG 6 h after transfection. 18 after 6TG treatment, lysates were harvested
and probed by western blot as indicated. (C) Samples from A were treated with PNGase F
to remove N-linked oligosaccharides. (D) 293T were transfected as in (B) and then treated
with 10 µM 6TG, 10 µM 6MP, or vehicle control and co-treated 10 mM 4PBA or 10 µM
DBeQ. 18h after treatment, lysates were harvested and probed by western blot as
indicated.
