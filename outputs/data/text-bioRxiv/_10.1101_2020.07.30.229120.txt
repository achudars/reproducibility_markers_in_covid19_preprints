Abstract

24

A successful SARS-CoV-2 vaccine must be not only safe and protective but must also meet the demand

25

on a global scale at low cost. Using the current influenza virus vaccine production capacity to

26

manufacture an egg-based inactivated Newcastle disease virus (NDV)/SARS-CoV-2 vaccine would meet

27

that challenge. Here, we report pre-clinical evaluations of an inactivated NDV chimera stably expressing

28

the membrane-anchored form of the spike (NDV-S) as a potent COVID-19 vaccine in mice and hamsters.

29

The inactivated NDV-S vaccine was immunogenic, inducing strong binding and/or neutralizing

30

antibodies in both animal models. More importantly, the inactivated NDV-S vaccine protected animals

31

from SARS-CoV-2 infections or significantly attenuated SARS-CoV-2 induced disease. In the presence

32

of an adjuvant, antigen-sparing could be achieved, which would further reduce the cost while maintaining

33

the protective efficacy of the vaccine.

Introduction

41

A severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine is urgently needed to mitigate

42

the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic worldwide. Numerous vaccine approaches

43

are being developed (1-4), however, many of them are not likely to be cost-effective and affordable by

44

low-income countries and under-insured populations. This could be of concern in the long run, as it is

45

crucial to vaccinate a larger population than the high-income minority to establish herd immunity and

46

effectively contain the spread of the virus. Among all the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates, an inactivated

47

vaccine might have the advantage over live vaccines of having a better safety profile in vulnerable

48

individuals. In addition, inactivated vaccines could be combined with an adjuvant for better protective

49

efficacy and dose-sparing to meet the large global demand. However, the current platform to produce the

50

inactivated whole virion SARS-CoV-2 vaccine requires the propagation of the virus in cell culture under

51

BSL-3 conditions (3) and only very few BSL-3 vaccine production facilities exist, limiting the scaling.

52

Excessive inactivation procedures might have to be implemented to ensure the complete inactivation of

53

the virus, at the risk of losing antigenicity of the vaccine. Many viral vector vaccines against

54

coronaviruses have been developed, but they can only be tested as live vaccines (4-9). In addition, the

55

efficacy of certain viral vectors could be dampened by pre-existing immunity to the viral backbone in the

56

human population. Most recombinant protein vaccines require cumbersome manufacturing procedures

57

that would be difficult for their inexpensive mass manufacturing. Genetic vaccines (mRNA and DNA

58

vaccines) have a great promise, but as they have been developed only recently, their performance in

59

humans is uncertain.

60
61

We have previously reported the construction of Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-based viral vectors

62

expressing a pre-fusion spike protein, whose transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail were replaced

63

with those from the NDV fusion (F) protein (S-F chimera) (10). We have shown that these NDV vector

64

vaccines grow well in embryonated chicken eggs, and that the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) proteins are

65

abundantly incorporated into the NDV virions. The NDV vector, based on a vaccine virus strain against

66

an avian pathogen, overcomes the abovementioned limitation for viral vector vaccines and allows the

67

manufacturing of the vaccine prior to its inactivation under BSL-2 conditions. In this study, we

68

investigated an attenuated recombinant NDV expressing the membrane-anchored S-F chimera (NDV-S)

69

as an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate with and without an adjuvant in mice and hamsters. We

70

found that the S-F chimera expressed by the NDV vector is very stable with no antigenicity loss after 3

71

weeks of 4°C storage in allantoic fluid. The beta-propiolactone (BPL) inactivated NDV-S vaccine is

72

immunogenic, inducing high titers of S-specific antibodies in both animal models. Furthermore, the

73

effects of a clinical-stage investigational liposomal suspension adjuvant (R-enantiomer of the cationic

74

lipid DOTAP, R-DOTAP) (11-14), as well as an MF-59 like oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant (AddaVax)

75

were also evaluated in mice. Both adjuvants were shown to achieve dose sparing (>10 fold) in mice. The

76

vaccinated animals were protected from SARS-CoV-2 infection or SARS-CoV-2 induced disease. This is

77

encouraging as the existing global egg-based production capacity for inactivated influenza virus vaccines

78

could be utilized immediately to rapidly produce egg-based NDV-S vaccine with minimal modifications

79

to their production pipelines. Most importantly, this class of products is amenable to large-scale

80

production at low cost and has an excellent safety profile in infants, pregnant women and the elderly (15-

81

17). Alternatively, the NDV-S and other chimeric NDV vaccines can also be manufactured in cultured

82

cells such as Vero cells (18).

Materials and Methods

85

Plasmids

86

The construction of NDV_LS/L289A_S-F rescue plasmid has been described in a previous study (10).

87

Briefly, the sequence of the ectodomain of the S without the polybasic cleavage site (682RRAR685 to A)

88

was amplified from pCAGGS plasmid (19) encoding the codon-optimized nucleotide sequence of the S

89

gene (GenBank: MN908947.3) of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate (Wuhan-Hu-1/2020) by polymerase chain

90

reaction (PCR), using primers containing the gene end (GE), gene start (GS) and a Kozak sequences at

91

the 5’ end (20). The nucleotide sequence of the transmembrane domain (TM) and the cytoplasmic tail

92

(CT) of the NDV_LaSota fusion (F) protein was codon-optimized for mammalian cells and synthesized

93

by IDT (gBlock). The amplified S ectodomain was fused to the TM/CT of F through a GS linker

94

(GGGGS). Additional nucleotides were added at the 3’ end to follow the “rule of six” of paramyxovirus

95

genome. The S-F gene was inserted between the P and M gene of pNDV_LaSota (LS) L289A mutant

96

(NDV_LS/L289A) antigenomic cDNA by in-Fusion cloning (Clontech). The recombination product was

97

transformed into NEB® Stable Competent E. coli (New England Biolabs, Inc.) to generate the

98

NDV_LS/L289A_S-F rescue plasmid. The plasmid was purified using PureLinkTM HiPure Plasmid

99

Maxiprep Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Rescue of NDV LaSota expressing the spike of SARS-CoV-2

115

To rescue NDV_LS/L289A_S-F, six-well plates of BSRT7 cells were seeded 3 x 105 cells per well the

116

day before transfection. The next day, 4 µg of pNDV_LS/L289A_S-F, 2 µg of pTM1-NP, 1 µg of pTM1-

117

P, 1 µg of pTM1-L and 2 µg of pCI-T7opt were re-suspended in 250 µl of Opti-MEM (Gibco). The

118

plasmid cocktail was then gently mixed with 30 µL of TransIT LT1 transfection reagent (Mirus). The

119

mixture was incubated at room temperature (RT) for 30 min. Toward the end of the incubation, the

120

growth medium of each well was replaced with 1 ml of Opti-MEM. The transfection complex was added

121

dropwise to each well and the plates were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2. The supernatant and the cells

122

from transfected wells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection, and briefly homogenized by several

123

strokes using an insulin syringe. Two hundred microliters of the homogenized mixture were injected into

124

the allantoic cavity of 8- to 10-day old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs. The eggs

125

were incubated at 37°C for 3 days before being cooled at 4°C overnight. The allantoic fluid was collected

126

and clarified by centrifugation. The rescue of NDV was determined by hemagglutination (HA) assay

127

using 0.5% chicken or turkey red blood cells. The RNA of the positive samples was extracted and treated

128

with DNase I (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was

129

performed to amplify the transgene. The sequences of the transgenes were confirmed by Sanger

130

Sequencing (Genewiz). Recombinant DNA experiments were performed in accordance with protocols

131

approved by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC).

135

Before concentrating the virus, allantoic fluids were clarified by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm using a

136

Sorvall Legend RT Plus Refrigerated Benchtop Centrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4°C for 30 min

137

to remove debris. Live virus in the allantoic fluid was pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion in NTE

138

buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) by ultra-centrifugation in a Beckman L7-

139

65 ultracentrifuge at 25,000 rpm for two hours at 4°C using a Beckman SW28 rotor (Beckman Coulter,

140

Brea, CA, USA). Supernatants were aspirated off and the pellets were re-suspended in PBS (pH 7.4). The

141

protein content was determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To

142

prepare inactivated concentrated viruses, 1 part of 0.5 M disodium phosphate (DSP) was mixed with 38

143

parts of the allantoic fluid to stabilize the pH. One part of 2% beta-propiolactone (BPL) was added

144

dropwise to the mixture during shaking, which gave a final concentration of 0.05% BPL. The treated

145

allantoic fluid was mixed thoroughly and incubated on ice for 30 min. The mixture was then placed in a

146

37 °C water bath for two hours shaken every 15 min. The inactivated allantoic fluid was clarified by

147

centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 30 minutes. The loss of infectivity was confirmed by the lack of growth

148

(determined by HA assay) of the virus from 10-day old embryonated chicken eggs that were inoculated

149

with inactivated virus preparations. The inactivated viruses were concentrated as described above.

150
151

Evaluation of stability of the S-F in the allantoic fluid

152

The allantoic fluid containing the NDV_LS/L289A_S-F virus was harvested and clarified by

153

centrifugation. The clarified allantoic fluid was aliquoted into 15 ml volumes. Week (wk) 0 allantoic fluid

154

was concentrated immediately after centrifugation as described above through a 20% sucrose cushion.

155

The pelleted virus was re-suspended in 300 µL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and stored at -80°C. The

156

other three aliquots of the allantoic fluid were maintained at 4°C to test the stability of the S-F construct.

157

Wk 1, 2 and 3 samples were collected consecutively on a weekly basis, and concentrated virus was

158

prepared in 300 µL PBS using the same method. The protein content of the concentrated virus from wk 0,

159

1, 2, and 3 was determined using BCA assay after one free-thaw from -80°C. One microgram of each

160

concentrated virus preparation was resolved on a 4-20% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel

161

electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, Bio-Rad) and the S-F protein and the NDV hemagglutinin-neuraminidase

162

(HN) protein were detected by Western blot.

169

(ThermoFisher Scientific) as the protein marker. To perform Western blots, proteins were transferred

170

onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (GE healthcare). The membrane was blocked with

171

5% non-fat dry milk in PBS containing 0.1% v/v Tween 20 (PBST) for 1 h at room temperature (RT).

172

The membrane was washed with PBST on a shaker three times (10 min at RT each time) and incubated

173

with an S-specific mouse monoclonal antibody 2B3E5 (provided by Dr. Thomas Moran at ISMMS) or an

174

HN-specific mouse monoclonal antibody 8H2 (MCA2822, Biorad) diluted in PBST containing 1%

175

bovine serum albumin (BSA), overnight at 4°C. The membranes were then washed with PBST on a

176

shaker 3 times (10 min at RT each time) and incubated with secondary sheep anti-mouse IgG linked with

177

horseradish peroxidase (HRP) diluted (1:2,000) in PBST containing 5% non-fat dry milk. The secondary

178

antibody was discarded and the membranes were washed with PBST on a shaker three times (10 min at

179

RT each time). Pierce™ ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to the

180

membrane, the blots were imaged using the Bio-Rad Universal Hood Ii Molecular imager (Bio-Rad) and

181

processed by Image Lab Software (Bio-Rad).

Immunization and challenge study in BALB/c mice

184

Seven-week old female BALB/cJ mice (Jackson Laboratories) were used in this study. Experiments were

185

performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai

186

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Mice were divided into 10 groups (n=5)

187

receiving the inactivated virus without or with an adjuvant at three different doses intramuscularly. The

188

vaccination followed a prime-boost regimen in a 2-week interval. Specifically, group 1, group 2 and

189

group 3 received 5 µg, 10 µg and 20 µg inactivated NDV-S vaccine (total protein) without the adjuvant,

190

respectively; Group 4, group 5 and group 6 received low doses of 0.2 µg, 1 µg and 5 µg of inactivated

191

NDV-S vaccine, respectively, combined with 300 µg/mouse of R-DOTAP (PDS Biotechnology); Group

192

7, group 8 and group 9 mice received 0.2 µg, 1 µg and 5 µg of inactivated NDV-S vaccine, respectively,

193

with 50 µl/mouse of AddaVax (Invivogen) as the adjuvant. Group 10 received 20 µg inactivated WT

194

NDV as the vector-only control. The SARS-CoV-2 challenge was performed at the University of North

195

Carolina by Dr. Ralph Baric’s group in a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) facility. Mice were intranasally (i.n

196

challenged 19 days after the boost using a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain (1, 21) at 7.5 x 104 plaque

203

vaccines were given intramuscularly following a prime-boost regimen in a 2-week interval. Group 1

204

received 10 µg of inactivated NDV-S vaccine; group 2 received 5 µg of inactivated NDV-S vaccine

205

combined with 50 µl of AddaVax per hamster; group 3 hamsters received 10 µg of inactivated WT NDV

206

as vector-only control. A healthy control group receiving no vaccine was also included. Twenty-four days

207

after the boost, hamsters were challenged intranasally with 104 PFU of the USA-WA1/2020 SARS-CoV-2

208

strain in a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) facility. Weight loss was monitored for 5 days.

209
210

Lung titers

211

Lung lobes of mice were collected and homogenized in PBS. A plaque assay was performed to measure

212

viral titer in the lung homogenates as described previously (1, 21). Geometric mean titers of plaque

213

forming units (PFU) per lobe were calculated using GraphPad Prism 7.0.

214
215

Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs)

216

Mice were bled pre-boost and 11 days after the boost. Hamsters were bled pre-boost and 26 days after the

217

boost. Sera were isolated by low-speed centrifugation. ELISAs were performed as described previously

218

(19). Briefly, Immulon 4 HBX 96-well ELISA plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were coated with 2

219

µg/ml of recombinant trimeric S protein (50ul per well) in coating buffer (SeraCare Life Sciences Inc.)

220

overnight at 4°C. The next day, all plates were washed 3 times with 220 µL PBS containing 0.1% (v/v)

221

Tween-20 (PBST) and blocked in 220 µL blocking solution (3% goat serum, 0.5% non-fat dried milk

222

powder, 96.5% PBST) for 1 h at RT. Both mouse sera and hamster sera were 3-fold serially diluted in

223

blocking solution starting at 1:30 followed by a 2 h incubation at RT. ELISA plates were washed 3 times

224

with PBST and incubated in 50 µL per well of sheep anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP)

225

conjugated antibody (GE Healthcare) or goat anti-hamster IgG-HRP conjugated antibody (Invitrogen)

226

diluted (1:3,000) in blocking solution. Plates were washed 3 times with PBST and 100 µL of o-

227

phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (SigmaFast OPD, Sigma) substrate was added per well. After

228

developing the plates for 10 min, 50 µL of 3 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) was added to each well to stop

229

the reactions. The optical density (OD) was measured at 492 nm on a Synergy 4 plate reader (BioTek) or

230

equivalents. An average of OD values for blank wells plus three standard deviations was used to set a

231

cutoff for plate blank outliers. A cutoff value was established for each plate that was used for calculating

232

the endpoint titers. The endpoint titers of serum IgG responses was graphed using GraphPad Prism 7.0.

233
234

Micro-neutralization assay

235

All neutralization assays were performed in the biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility following institutional

236

guidelines as described previously (19, 22). Briefly, serum samples were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 60

237

minutes prior to use. Vero E6 cells were maintained in culture using DMEM supplemented with 10%

238

fetal bovine serum (FBS). Twenty-thousands cells per well were seeded in a 96-well cell culture plate the

239

night before the assay. Pooled sera in technical duplicates were serially diluted by 3-fold starting at 1:20

240

in a 96-well cell culture plate and each dilution was mixed with 600 times the 50% tissue culture

241

infectious dose (TCID50) of SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020, BEI Resources NR-52281). Serum-virus

242

mixture was incubated for 1 h at RT before being added to the cells for another hour of incubation in a

243

37°C incubator. The virus-serum mixture was removed and the corresponding serum dilution was added

244

to the cells. The cells were incubated for 2 days and fixed with 100 µL 10% formaldehyde per well for 24

245

h before taken out of the BSL-3 facility. The staining of the cells was performed in a BSL-2 biosafety

246

cabinet. The formaldehyde was carefully removed from the cells. Cells were washed with 200 µL PBS

247

once before being permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at RT. Cells were

248

washed with PBS and blocked in PBS containing 3% dry milk for 1h at RT. Cells were then stained with

249

100 µL per well of a mouse monoclonal anti-NP antibody (1C7), kindly provided by Dr. Thomas Moran

250

at ISMMS, at 1µg/ml for 1h at RT. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 100 µL per well anti-

251

mouse IgG HRP (Rockland) secondary antibody at 1:3,000 dilution in PBS containing 1% dry milk for 1h

252

at RT. Finally, cells were washed twice with PBS and the plates were developed using 100 µL of

253

SigmaFast OPD substrate. Ten minutes later, the reactions were stopped using 50 µL per well of 3M HCI.

254

The OD 492 nm was measured on a Biotek SynergyH1 Microplate Reader. Non-linear regression curve

255

fit analysis (The top and bottom constraints were set at 100% and 0%) over the dilution curve was

256

performed to calculate 50% of inhibitory dilution (ID50) of the serum using GraphPad Prism 7.0.

which NDV vectors expressing the S-F chimera (10) showed higher abundance of the spike protein in the

263

NDV particles than the NDV vector expressing just the wild type (WT) S protein. The final construct also

264

had a mutation (L289A) in the F protein of NDV which was shown to facilitate HN-independent fusion of

265

the virus (Fig. 1A). To develop an NDV-based inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the existing global

266

influenza virus vaccine production capacity could be employed as both influenza virus and NDV grow to

267

high titers in embryonated chicken eggs. With minor modifications to the manufacturing process of

268

inactivated influenza virus vaccines, NDV-S vaccine can be purified by zonal sucrose density

269

centrifugation. Egg-grown influenza virus vaccines are inactivated by formalin or beta-propiolactone

270

(BPL) treatment. For the inactivated NDV-S vaccine we chose BPL inactivation because it is believed to

271

be a less disrupting inactivation process. Such inactivated NDV-S vaccines will display SARS-CoV-2

272

spike proteins together with HN and F NDV proteins on the surface of the whole inactivated virion. Due

273

to the large size, the spike proteins are likely immunodominant relative to the HN and F proteins. The

274

inactivated NDV-S vaccine could be administered intramuscularly, with an adjuvant for dose sparing.

275

This approach should be suited to safely induce spike-specific protective antibodies (Fig. 1B).

276
277

The spike protein expressed on NDV virions is stable in allantoic fluid

278

The stability of the antigen could be of concern as the vaccine needs to be purified and inactivated

279

through a temperature-controlled (~4°C) process. The final product is often formulated and stored in

280

liquid buffer at 4°C. To examine the stability of the S-F protein, allantoic fluid containing the NDV-S live

281

virus was aliquoted into equal volumes (15 ml), and stored at 4°C. Samples were collected weekly (wk 0,

282

1, 2, 3) and concentrated through a 20% sucrose cushion. The concentrated virus was re-suspended in

283

equal amounts of PBS. The total protein content of the 4 aliquots was comparable among the preparations

284

(wk 0: 0.94 mg/ml; wk 1: 1.04 mg/ml; wk 2: 0.9 mg/ml; wk 3: 1.08 mg/ml). The cold stability of the S-F

285

construct was evaluated by Western blot with the anti-S monoclonal antibody, 2B3E5. As compared to

286

the stability of the NDV HN protein, the Spike protein remained stable when kept in allanotic fluid at

287

4 °C (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the inactivation procedure using 0.05% BPL did not cause any loss of

288

antigenicity of the S-F, as evaluated by Western blot (Fig. 2B). These observations demonstrate that the

289

membrane anchored S-F chimera expressed by the NDV vector is very stable without degradation at 4°C

290

for 3 weeks or when treated with BPL for inactivation.

291
292

Inactivated NDV-S vaccine induced high titers of binding and neutralizing antibodies in mice

293

For a pre-clinical evaluation of the inactivated NDV-S vaccine, immunogenicity as well as the dose

294

sparing ability of the adjuvants were investigated in mice. The vaccines were administered

295

intramuscularly, following a prime-boost regimen in a 2-week interval. Specifically, for the three

296

unadjuvanted groups, mice were intramuscularly immunized with increasing doses of inactivated NDV-S

297

vaccine at 5 µg, 10 µg or 20 µg per mouse. Two adjuvants were tested here, a clinical-stage adjuvant,

298

liposomal suspension of the pure R-enantiomer of the cationic lipid DOTAP (R-DOTAP) and the MF59-

299

like oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant AddaVax. Each adjuvant was combined with low doses of NDV-S

300

vaccines at 0.2 µg, 1 µg and 5 µg. Mice receiving 20 µg of inactivated WT NDV were used as vector-only

301

(negative) controls (Fig. 3A). Mice were bled pre-boost (2 weeks after prime) and 11 days post-boost to

302

examine antibody responses by ELISA using a trimeric full-length S protein as the substrate (19), and

303

micro-neutralization assay using the USA-WA1/2020 strain of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.3A). After one

304

immunization, all vaccination groups developed S-specific antibodies. The boost greatly increased the

305

antibody titers of all NDV-S immunization groups. Immunization with R-DOTAP combined with 5 µg of

306

vaccine induced the highest antibody titer. Immunization with one microgram of vaccine formulated with

307

R-DOTAP or AddaVax and 5 µg of vaccine with AddaVax induced comparable levels of binding

308

antibody, which is also similar to the titers induced by 20 µg of vaccine without an adjuvant. As expected,

309

immunization with the inactivated wild type NDV virus did not induce S-specific antibody responses

310

(Fig. 3B). We performed microneutralization assays to determine the neutralizing activity of serum

311

antibodies collected from vaccinated mice. Except for mice immunized with the WT NDV, sera from all

312

mice immunized with NDV-S vaccine showed neutralizing activity against the SARS-CoV-2 USA-

313

WA1/2020 strain. The neutralization titers induced by immunization with of 1 µg of vaccine with R-

314

DOTAP (ID50 of ~476) and 5 µg of vaccine with AddaVax groups (ID50 of ~515) appeared to be the

315

highest and were comparable to each other. These titer levels are also in the higher range of human

316

convalescent serum neutralization titers as measured in our previous studies (19, 23). Interestingly,

317

although the group receiving 5 µg of vaccine with R-DOTAP developed the most abundant binding

318

antibodies detected by ELISA, these sera were not the most neutralizing ones suggesting R-DOTAP

319

might have a different impact on immunogenicity compared to AddaVax. R-DOTAP is an immune

320

modulator, that induces the production of important cytokines and chemokines and enhances cytolytic T

321

cells when combined with proteins. It is possible that with more antigen, the immune responses were

322

skewed towards the induction of non-neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 3C). In any case, these results

323

demonstrated that inactivated NDV-S vaccine expressing the membrane anchored S-F was immunogenic

324

inducing potent binding and neutralizing antibodies. Importantly, at least 10-fold dose sparing was

325

achieved with an adjuvant in mice.

326
327

The inactivated NDV-S vaccine protects mice from infection by a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2

328

To evaluate vaccine-induced protection, mice were challenged 19 days post-boost using a mouse-adapted

329

SARS-CoV-2 virus (1, 21) (Fig. 3A). Weight loss was monitored for 4 days post infection, at which point

330

the mice were euthanized to assess pulmonary virus titers. Only the negative control group receiving the

331

WT NDV was observed to lose notable weight (~10%) by day 4 post-infection, while all the vaccinated

332

groups showed no weight loss (Fig.4A). Viral titers in the lung at 4 days post challenge were also

333

measured. As expected, the negative control group given the WT NDV exhibited the highest viral titer

334

of >104 PFU/lobe. Groups receiving 5 µg of unadjuvanted vaccine or 0.2 µg of vaccine with R-DOTAP

335

showed detectable but low viral titers in the lung, while all the other groups were fully protected showing

336

no viral loads (Fig. 4B). These results are encouraging as immunization with 0.2 µg of vaccine adjuvanted

337

with AddaVax conferred a level of protection that was equal to that induced by immunization with 10 µg

338

of vaccine without an adjuvant. Although 0.2 µg of vaccine with R-DOTAP did not induce sterilizing

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.30.229120; this version posted July 31, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

339

immunity, approximately a 1000-fold reduction of viral titer in the lungs was achieved. To conclude, the

340

inactivated NDV-S exhibits great potential as a cost-effective vaccine as it induces protective immunity

341

against the SARS-CoV-2 at very low doses with an adjuvant.

342
343

The inactivated NDV-S vaccine confers protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in a hamster

344

model

345

Golden Syrian hamsters have been characterized as a useful small animal model for COVID-19 as they

346

are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infections and manifest SARS-CoV-2 induced diseases (24, 25). Here,

347

we conducted a pilot study that assessed the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the inactivated

348

NDV-S vaccine in hamsters. Female golden Syrian hamsters were immunized by a prime-boost regimen

349

in a 2-week interval via the intramuscular administration route. Twenty-four days after the booster

350

immunization, hamsters were intranasally infected with 104 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020)

351

virus. Four groups of hamsters were included in this pilot study. Group 1 was immunized with 10 µg of

352

inactivated NDV-S vaccine per animal without adjuvants. Group 2 received 5 µg of inactivated NDV-S

353

vaccine with AddaVax as an adjuvant. Group 3 was immunized with 10 µg of inactivated WT NDV as

354

the vector-only negative control group. Group 4, which was not vaccinated and was mock-challenged

355

with PBS, was included as the healthy control group (Fig. 5A). Serum IgG titers sampled prior to the

356

booster immunization and at 2 days post-infection (dpi) were measured by ELISA. One immunization

357

with NDV-S vaccine with or without the adjuvant successfully induced spike-specific antibodies. Since

358

there was no seroconversion from infection at 2 dpi indicated by baseline level of the WT NDV sera, the

359

increase in titers at 2 dpi as compared to titers after vaccine priming most likely represent vaccine-

360

induced antibody levels after the boost. As expected, the boost substantially increased the antibody titers

361

in the NDV-S vaccination groups, whereas the WT NDV sera showed negligible binding signals (Fig.

362

5B). Nevertheless, we cannot exclude a contribution from a rapid production of S antibodies by vaccine-

363

induced memory B cells after exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Hamsters were challenged and weight loss was

364

monitored for 5 days. The WT NDV group lost up to 15% of weight by 5 dpi. Animals receiving 10 µg

365

of inactivated NDV-S vaccine lost ~10% of weight by 3 dpi, at which point body weights started to

366

recover. Animals receiving 5 µg of inactivated NDV-S vaccine with AddaVax only lost weight by 2 dpi,

367

at which point body weights started to recover (Fig. 5C). These data suggested inactivated NDV-S

368

vaccine could effectively attenuate the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 induced diseases in hamsters.

369
370

Discussion

371

We have previously reported NDV-based SARS-CoV-2 live vaccines expressing two forms of spike

372

protein (S and S-F)(10). Since the S-F showed superior incorporation into NDV particles, we investigated

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.30.229120; this version posted July 31, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

373

its potential of being used as an inactivated vaccine in this study. The NDV-S was found to be very stable

374

when stored at 4°C for 3 weeks with no loss of antigenicity of the S-F protein. In mice, we have shown a

375

total amount of inactivated NDV-S vaccine as low as 0.2 µg could significantly reduce viral titers in the

376

lung when combined with R-DOTAP, by approximately a factor of 1000, while the adjuvant AddaVax

377

conferred even better protection. NDV-S vaccine at 1 µg with either adjuvant elicited potent neutralizing

378

antibodies and resulted in undetectable viral titers in the lung after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. These pre-

379

clinical results demonstrate that antigen-sparing greater than 10-fold can be achieved in a mouse model,

380

providing valuable input for clinical trials in humans. In a pilot hamster experiment, the inactivated NDV-

381

S vaccine is also immunogenic inducing high titers of spike-specific antibodies. Since hamsters are much

382

more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the group receiving the WT NDV lost up to 15% of weight

383

by day 5, while both NDV-S vaccinated groups with or without the adjuvant greatly attenuated SARS-

384

CoV-2 induced disease determined by the weight loss. The AddaVax adjuvant again enhanced vaccine-

385

induced protection, resulting in weight loss only on 2 dpi of the group. We did not evaluate the adjuvant

386

R-DOTAP, as the dosing was not well determined for this model by the time of this study. However, R-

387

DOTAP as well as additional adjuvants will be evaluated in combination with the inactivated NDV-S

388

vaccine in future studies. In addition, we will examine other outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 induced disease

389

in hamsters, such as viral titers in nasal washes or lungs.

390
391

We have shown promising protection by immunization with inactivated NDV-S in both the mouse and

392

the hamster models. Even though sterilizing immunity might not always be induced, the trade-off for

393

having an affordable and widely available effective vaccine that reduces the symptoms of COVID-19

394

should be much preferred over a high-cost vaccine that is limited to high income populations. Most

395

importantly, the egg-based production of NDV-S vaccine only requires only minor modifications to the

396

current inactivated influenza virus vaccine manufacturing process. The cost of goods should be similar to

397

that of a monovalent inactivated influenza virus vaccine (a fraction of the cost of a quadrivalent seasonal

398

influenza virus vaccine), or even lower due to dose sparing with an adjuvant that is inexpensive to

399

manufacture.

Figure 1. Design and concept of an inactivated NDV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine

528

(A) Design of the NDV-S vaccine. The sequence of the S-F chimera (green: ectodomain of S; black: the

529

transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of NDV F protein) was inserted between the P and M gene

530

of the NDV LaSota (NDV_LS) strain L289A mutant (NDV_LS/L289A). NDV-S: NDV_LS/L289A_S-F.

531

The polybasic cleavage site of the S was removed (682RRAR685 to A). (B) The concept overview of an

532

inactivated NDV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The NDV-S vaccine could be produced using current

533

global influenza virus vaccine production capacity. Such an NDV-S vaccine displays abundant S protein

534

on the surface of the virions. The NDV-S vaccine will be inactivated by beta-propiolactone (BPL). The

535

NDV-S vaccine will be administered intramuscularly (i.m.) to elicit protective antibody responses in

536

humans.

(A) Stability of the S-F chimera. Allantoic fluid containing the NDV-S virus was aliquoted into equal

540

amounts (15 ml) and stored at 4°C. Virus from each aliquot was concentrated through a 20% sucrose

541

cushion, re-suspended in equal amount of PBS, and then stored at - 80°C for several weeks (wk 0, wk 1,

wk 2, wk 3). One microgram of each concentrated virus was resolved onto 4-20% SDS-PAGE. Protein

543

degradation was evaluated by Western blot using a S-specific mouse monoclonal antibody 2B3E5. HN

544

protein of NDV was used as an NDV protein control. (B) Antigenicity of the S-F before and after BPL

545

inactivation. Live or inactivated (using 0.05% BPL) NDV-S virus was concentrated through a 20%

546

sucrose cushion as described previously. Two micrograms of live or BPL inactivated virus were loaded

547

onto 4-20% SDS-PAGE. Antigenicity loss of the S-F was evaluated by western blot as described in A.

(A) Immunization regimen and groups. BALB/c mice were given two immunizations via intramuscular

551

administration route with a 2-week interval. Mice were bled pre-boost and 11 days after the boost for in

552

vitro serological assays. Mice were challenged with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain 19 days after

553

the boost. Ten groups described in the table were included in this study. Group 1, 2 and 3 were

554

immunized with 5µg, 10 µg and 20 µg of vaccine, respectively; group 4, 5 and 6 were immunized with

555

0.2 µg, 1 µg and 5 µg of vaccine formulated with R-DOTAP, respectively; group 7, 8 and 9 were

556

immunized with 0.2 µg, 1 µg and 5 µg of vaccine combined with AddaVax, respectively; group 10 was

557

immunized with 20 µg of WT NDV virus as the vector-only control. (B) Spike-specific serum IgG titers.

558

Serum IgG titers from animals after prime (pattern bars) and boost (solid bars) toward the recombinant

559

trimeric spike protein was measured by ELISA. Endpoint titers were shown as the readout for ELISA. (C)

Neutralization titers of serum antibodies. Microneutralization assays were performed to determine the

561

neutralizing activities of serum antibodies from animals after the boost (D26) using the USA-WA1/2020

562

SARS-CoV-2 strain. The ID50 of serum samples showing no neutralizing activity (WT NDV) is set as 10.

WT NDV was included as vector-only (negative) control. Group 4 receiving no vaccine were mock

578

challenged with PBS as healthy controls. (B) Spike-specific serum IgG titers. Hamsters were bled pre-

579

boost and a subset of hamsters were terminally bled at 2 dpi. Vaccine-induced serum IgG titers towards

580

the trimeric spike protein were determined by ELISA. Endpoint titers were shown as the readout for

581

ELISA. (C) Weight loss of hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2. Weight loss of SARS-CoV-2
