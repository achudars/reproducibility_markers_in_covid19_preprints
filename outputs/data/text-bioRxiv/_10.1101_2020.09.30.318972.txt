Short title: LY-CoV555 provides protection against SARS-CoV-2
Abstract:
SARS-CoV-2 poses a public health threat for which therapeutic agents are urgently needed. Herein, we
report that high-throughput microfluidic screening of antigen-specific B-cells led to the identification of
LY-CoV555, a potent anti-spike neutralizing antibody from a convalescent COVID-19 patient.
Biochemical, structural, and functional characterization revealed high-affinity binding to the receptorbinding domain, ACE2 binding inhibition, and potent neutralizing activity. In a rhesus macaque challenge
model, prophylaxis doses as low as 2.5 mg/kg reduced viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory
tract. These data demonstrate that high-throughput screening can lead to the identification of a potent
antiviral antibody that protects against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

LY-CoV555, an anti-spike antibody derived from a convalescent COVID-19 patient, potently neutralizes
SARS-CoV-2 and protects the upper and lower airways of non-human primates against SARS-CoV-2
infection.

Main Text:
The global COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread rapidly with substantial health, economic, and
societal impact.(1) Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel
coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 disease, can induce acute respiratory distress syndrome and a
wide spectrum of symptoms leading to substantial morbidity and mortality.(2) Neutralizing antibodies
represent an important class of therapeutics which could provide immediate benefit in treatment or as
passive prophylaxis until vaccines are widely available. Passive prophylaxis could be an alternative to
vaccination in populations where vaccines have been found to be less efficacious.(3, 4)
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody discovery efforts have focused on targeting the multi-domain surface
spike protein, a trimeric class I fusion protein that mediates viral entry. Spike protein-dependent viral
entry is initiated by upward movement of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) at the apex of the protein
allowing access to bind the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptor.(5-8) Upon
receptor engagement, coordinated proteolytic cleavage, shedding of the S1 subunit, and conformational
rearrangement of the S2 subunit, leads to viral fusion with the cell and transfer of genetic material. Given
the critical nature of the RBD interaction with ACE2 for viral entry, antibodies that bind the RBD and
interfere with ACE2 binding can have potent neutralizing activity.(9-11)
To test the potential for neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in
vivo, we used the rhesus macaque challenge model. While rhesus macaques do not exhibit the severe
pulmonary symptoms sometimes associated with human COVID-19 disease, the model allows assessment
of viral replication in the upper and lower airways.(12-16) Of particular interest, recent studies in this

model have shown that prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2 or administration of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine are
sufficient to prevent infection upon subsequent challenge.(15, 17) Protecting non-human primates (NHPs)
from SARS-CoV-2 infection may inform the clinical development of medical countermeasures for
COVID-19.(14, 18)
In this study, we report a strategy for high-throughput screening, which allowed for the rapid
identification and subsequent characterization of anti-spike neutralizing antibodies. An RBD-specific
antibody (LY-CoV555) was discovered that can bind the RBD in the up (active) or down (resting)
conformation and potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Passive immunization by infusion of LYCoV555 protected both upper and lower airways from SARS-CoV-2 infection in a rhesus macaque
model. These data supported the progression of LY-CoV555 into clinical evaluation.

Identification and characterization of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies
To identify potential therapeutic antibodies from a convalescent COVID-19 patient, a novel highthroughput screening approach was used to identify relevant anti-spike mAbs (Fig. 1, Fig. S1A).
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained approximately 20 days post onset of
symptoms. Two screening assays were utilized: (1) a multiplexed bead-based assay using opticallyencoded microbeads, each conjugated to either soluble prefusion-stabilized trimeric SARS-CoV-2 or
SARS-CoV spike protein and (2) a live cell-based assay using mammalian cells that transiently express
full-length membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Fig. S1A). In total, 5.8 million PBMCs were
screened over three days, and machine learning (ML)-based analysis pipelines were used to automatically
select and rank > 4,500 antibody “hits” (0.08% frequency), of which 2,238 single antibody-secreting cells
were chosen for recovery. Next-generation sequencing libraries of antibody genes from selected single Bcells were generated and sequenced, and a custom bioinformatics pipeline with ML-based sequence
curation was used to identify paired-chain antibody sequences, resulting in 440 unique high-confidence
paired heavy and light chain sequences (Fig. 1). The sequences belonged to 394 clonal families and used

a diverse set of 39 VH genes, with the VH3 family of genes representing 57% of total diversity (Fig.
S1B), similar to other reports.(19) Among these, the VH3-30 gene was the most common (39%) (Fig.
S1B). Of the 440 unique antibodies identified, 4% were cross-reactive to both full-length SARS-CoV-2
and SARS-CoV spike proteins. The mean sequence identity to germline was high (98% and 99% for
heavy and light chains respectively; Fig. S1B), likely due to sample collection early in the immune
response.
From the set of 440 antibodies, we used an internally developed informatics and data visualization
software package, CeliumTM, to select 187 antibodies for rapid cloning and expression. Preference was
given to antibodies observed at high frequency across the dataset, especially those discovered in both
multiplexed soluble protein and live-cell assays. The selection also maximized the diversity of VH genes
and CDR3 sequences, and limited CDR3 sequence liabilities. A total of 175 sequences were successfully
cloned into expression vectors to generate recombinant antibodies with immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)
backbones for more detailed characterization. Subsequent characterization included high-throughput
biophysical analysis (Fig. S2A), validation of soluble and cell-associated spike protein binding, cross
reactivity to other coronavirus spike proteins and three circulating SARS-CoV-2 spike variants (Fig.
S2B), apparent binding affinity to soluble spike by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (Fig. 2A), and
functional screening in a high-throughput pseudotyped lentivirus reporter neutralization assay (Fig. 2C).
High-throughput SPR experiments were used to characterize the epitope coverage of the 175 antibodies:
these experiments included antibody pairing, isolated domain binding, and binding competition with
ACE2 (Fig. 2). Benchmark antibodies with known binding to S1 subunit, N-terminal domain, RBD, and
S2 subunit epitopes of the SARS-CoV spike protein and cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
were included to mark epitope identity. Antibody cross-blocking results are summarized in the
competition plot (Fig. 2B), as well as in the heat map (Fig. S3). In total, 95 unique bins (including
controls) were identified, and a clear divide between S1- and S2-specific antibodies as inferred by

benchmark competition was seen (Fig. 2B, Fig. S3), suggesting that these antibodies possessed a broad
epitope diversity. Only approximately 10% of the antibodies tested exhibited ACE2 competition.
Antibodies with ACE2 binding inhibition properties had the greatest neutralizing activity based on
pseudotyped lentivirus reporter neutralization (Fig. 2C), although antibodies to other domains also had
detectable neutralizing activity.
A lead panel of 24 antibodies (Table S1) was selected using the Celium TM software, based on the
following criteria: (1) binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in either the multiplexed bead-based or the
live cell-based validation assay, (2) >30% pseudovirus neutralizing activity at any of the concentrations
tested (10, 1, 0.1, or 0.01 μg/mL), (3) dose-dependent neutralization profile, (4) RBD competition, (5)
ACE2 blocking activity, and (6) acceptable biophysical profile (melting temperature, solubility, and
polydispersity). The selected antibodies were then produced at larger scale for further functional testing,
epitope mapping, and structural analysis (summarized in Table S2, Table S3, Fig. S4, Fig. S5).
The selected antibodies had a broad range of neutralizing activity in multiple in vitro assays including
pseudovirus (Table S4) and various full virus assay formats (Fig. 2). Using a replication-competent
SARS-CoV-2 molecular clone modified with a nano-luciferase reporter virus, (Fig. 2D), half maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) neutralizing activity values spanning nearly three orders of magnitude
were observed (Table S4). For a smaller number of antibodies, viral neutralization was further
characterized in a Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) format against two different clinical
SARS-CoV-2 isolates (Fig. 2 E, F), the Italian INMI-1 isolate (clade 19A) and the USA/Wa-1/2020
isolate (clade 19B), representing the two major clades of SARS-CoV-2 (www.gisaid.com). Interestingly,
it was observed that some non-RBD binding antibodies, for example Ab82, Ab89, and Ab130, exhibited
greater neutralizing activity in some of the live virus SARS-CoV-2 assays compared to pseudovirus
assays (Table S4). Notably, the neutralization potency of one mAb, Ab169 (designated LY-CoV555), an

RBD binder and ACE2 blocker, was consistently and substantially greater than the rest and was selected
for further development.
LY-CoV555 possessed greater neutralization potency relative to other identified RBD-binding and
ACE2-blocking antibodies (e.g. Ab128 and Ab133), despite similar apparent binding affinities (Table
S2), suggesting a distinct binding mode of recognition. Structural analysis using X-ray crystallography
and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) demonstrated that two of the RBD-binding mAbs (Ab128 and
Ab133) bind in a nearly identical fashion to one another (Fig. S5), and in a similar fashion to the
previously described mAb CB6.(10) LY-CoV555 was observed to bind to an epitope overlapping the
ACE2 binding site (Fig. 3A, B, and C); specifically, 7 of the approximate 25 sidechains in the RBD
observed to form contact with ACE2.(5, 20, 21) Based on the crystal structure, the LY-CoV555 epitope
was predicted to be fully accessible on both the up and down conformations of the RBD. This was
confirmed by high resolution cryo-EM imaging of LY-CoV555 Fab complexes in which the LY-CoV555
Fab was observed to bind the spike protein RBD in both up and down conformations (Fig. 3D). This
unique property is analogous to the binding of the Ebola mAb114 that binds the GP receptor-binding
domain in both the pre-activation and activated states.(22) mAb114 was subsequently shown to
effectively treat Ebola disease as monotherapy.(23) This may indicate an advantage for mAbs that can
bind critical functional domains of class I fusion proteins at multiple stages of the entry process.

LY-CoV555 provides protection from infection and viral replication in an NHP model of SARSCoV-2 infection
To assess the ability of LY-CoV555 to protect from viral challenge, rhesus macaques were dosed
intravenously (IV) with 1, 2.5, 15 or 50 mg/kg of LY-CoV555 or 50 mg/kg of a control IgG1 antibody 24
hours prior to virus challenge. LY-CoV555 doses were chosen to provide a range of serum antibody
concentrations and inform subsequent clinical dosing. Macaques were inoculated intranasally and
intratracheally with a total of 1.1x105 pfu of SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1/2020) and were monitored by

twice daily cage-side observations and respiratory exams throughout the study. Respiratory and clinical
signs of disease in the macaques were limited, and generally mild lobar congestion and hyperemia were
observed macroscopically across control and treated groups suggestive of either interstitial or
bronchopneumonia. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, nasal and throat swabs were collected on Days
1, 3, and 6 after viral challenge (study Day 0). Viral genomes (gRNA) and subgenomic RNA (sgRNA),
indicative of active viral replication (12), were detectable in BAL, throat swabs, and nasal swabs for all
control animals following intranasal and intratracheal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5).
Prophylactic treatment with LY-CoV555 resulted in significant decreases in viral load (gRNA) and viral
replication (sgRNA) in the lower respiratory tract following SARS-CoV2 inoculation, based on
determinations in BAL and lung tissue (Fig. 4, Table S6). In the BAL, reductions of 10 2 to 105 in viral
replication and load were observed compared to controls across Days 1, 3 and 6, with significant
reductions in viral replication (1, 2.5, and 15 mg/kg doses; q<0.05) and load (15 mg/kg dose) on Day 1
and at all dose levels on Day 3 (Fig. 4A, C). In LY-CoV555-treated animals, viral replication in BAL was
undetectable by Day 3 at all dose levels (Fig. 4A). Consistent with BAL on Day 6, no viral replication
was observed in lung tissue harvested at necropsy in the 2.5, 15, and 50 mg/kg dose groups,
demonstrating a significant reduction (q-value<0.05) compared to control (Fig. 4B, Table S6). Viral loads
in the BAL and lung on Day 6 were significantly reduced (q-value<0.05) at the 2.5, 15, and 50 mg/kg
doses (Fig. 4C, D, Table S6).
LY-CoV555 also provided protection in the upper respiratory tract, with a significant reduction in gRNA
(q-value <0.05) at the 2.5, 15, and 50 mg/kg doses in the throat on Day 1 and the nose on Days 3 and 6
(Fig. 5C, D, Table S6). Most importantly, viral replication was significantly reduced in the nose (1, 2.5,
50 mg/kg doses) and throat (1, 2.5, 15, and 50 mg/kg doses) on Day 1 (q-value<0.05) and by Day 3, was
undetectable in the nose (<50 copies/swab) at the 2.5, 15, and 50 mg/kg dose levels (Fig. 5A, B, Table
S6).

Our results demonstrate that treatment with LY-CoV555 provides substantial upper respiratory tract
protection and indicate the potential for reduced viral shedding and transmission following treatment with
a neutralizing antibody. Given the robust nature and route of administration of the viral inoculum in this
model, we hypothesize that modest doses of LY-CoV555 could provide substantial clinical efficacy. To
this point, in a recent study of several prototype SARS-CoV-2 DNA vaccines, administration of a 10-fold
lower inoculum following immunization still resulted in detectable levels of sgRNA in the nose of most
immunized rhesus macaques.(15) Overall, we show dose-related reductions in gRNA and sgRNA in the
upper and lower respiratory tracts with maximal protection observed at doses of 2.5 mg/kg and above.
LY-CoV555 administration resulted in sustained serum concentrations after IV dosing, consistent with
expected pharmacokinetics for human IgG in a NHP model (Table S5). Mean serum concentrations of
LY-CoV555 on the day of viral challenge were 15 ±3, 38 ±14, 276 ±37 and 679 ±101 µg/mL at the 1, 2.5,
15, and 50 mg/kg dose levels, respectively. The dose responsive concentrations of serum LY-CoV555
were consistent with the dose-related reductions in viral loads in the lungs, throat, and nasal passages .
Importantly, serum concentrations of LY-CoV555 at doses of 2.5 mg/kg and higher were associated with
maximal protection in this rhesus infection model. The delayed impact on viral loads in nasal swabs could
reflect slower distribution of antibody into the nasal epithelial lining fluid versus the lung or throat.
This study describes the isolation and characterization of a potent anti-spike neutralizing antibody, LYCoV555, derived from a convalescent COVID-19 patient. LY-CoV555 was found to have RBD binding
and ACE2 blocking properties and displayed high affinity and potency due to its unique SARS-CoV-2
spike protein-binding properties. In both in vitro assays with full virus and an NHP model of SARS-CoV2 infection, LY-CoV555 displayed high protection potency supporting its development as a therapeutic
for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. This study also provides evidence that neutralizing
antibodies have potential as an important countermeasure to preventing and treating SARS-CoV-2
infection and reduce virus replication in the upper airway that may decrease transmission efficiency. LY9

CoV555 is presently under clinical evaluation for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19
(NCT04411628; NCT04427501; NCT04497987; NCT04501978).
The importance of prototype pathogen preparedness was demonstrated by the ability to rapidly design and
produce protein for B-cell probes based on prior work defining the structure and stabilization strategy for
the betacoronavirus spike protein.(24) The resulting speed at which this drug discovery and development
effort progressed, with achievement of first-in-human dose in only 90 days after the initiation of antibody
screening, is a testament to the advanced discovery and characterization platforms and pre-established
public-private partnership. Overall, the identification and characterization of LY-CoV555 points to the
feasibility of strategies to rapidly identify neutralizing human mAbs as part of an initial response to an
evolving pandemic that can complement population-scale vaccination, provide immediate passive
immunity, and provide protection for vulnerable populations.
