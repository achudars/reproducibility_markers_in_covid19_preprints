Abstract
The 2013-2016 West Africa EBOV epidemic was the biggest EBOV outbreak
to date. An analysis of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in 30 survivors
showed that 26 of those individuals had a CD8+ response to at least one EBOV
protein. The dominant response (25/26 subjects) was specific to the EBOV
nucleocapsid protein (NP). It has been suggested that epitopes on the EBOV
NP could form an important part of an effective T-cell vaccine for Ebola Zaire.
We show that a 9-amino-acid peptide NP44-52 (YQVNNLEEI) located in a
conserved region of EBOV NP provides protection against morbidity and mortality after mouse adapted EBOV challenge. A single vaccination in a C57BL/6

mouse using an adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine formulation containing
NP44-52 is enough to confer immunity in mice. Our work suggests that a peptide vaccine based on CD8+ T-cell immunity in EBOV survivors is conceptually
sound and feasible. Nucleocapsid proteins within SARS-CoV-2 contain multiple
class I epitopes with predicted HLA restrictions consistent with broad population coverage. A similar approach to a CTL vaccine design may be possible for
that virus.

1. Introduction
Development of safe and effective vaccines for some viruses such as HIV and
EBOV has been challenging [19]. Although vaccine development has been almost exclusively focused on eliciting a humoral immune response in the host
5

through inoculation with whole protein antigen [51][69][59][29], CTL peptide
vaccines producing a T-cell response may offer an important alternative approach [23]. For HIV and EBOV and influenza in particular, the potential
of CTL vaccines has been discussed [21][7][56]. Although computational prediction alone has been used for T-cell vaccine design [2][14], we saw a unique

10

opportunity to see if a preventative EBOV T-cell vaccine could be successfully
designed based on the specific epitopes targeted by survivors of documented
EBOV infection.
The notion of HLA restricted HIV control has been described [58]. PereyraHeckerman conducted an analysis of virus-specific CD8+ T-cell immunity in

15

individuals living with HIV [43]. They reported that HIV controllers, individuals
living with HIV not undergoing treatment who do not progress to AIDS, have
CD8+ cells targeting different HLA restricted class I epitopes on HIV compared
with progressors, individuals with HIV who progress to AIDS in the absence of
therapy. Pereyra-Heckerman suggested that this observation could guide the

20

in-silico development of a CTL vaccine for HIV and other diseases.

Acquired immunity has been documented after EBOV infection [4]. Antibody as well as T-cell responses have been described [44]. Sakebe et al. have
shown that of 30 subjects surviving the 2013-2016 EBOV outbreak in West
Africa, CD8+ T-cells from 26 of those survivors responded to at least one
25

EBOV antigen, with 25 of the 26 responders targeting epitopes on EBOV NP
[50]. One of the most commonly targeted EBOV eptitopes on EBOV NP in
the survivor group (targeted by CD8+ cells from four survivors) was NP41-60
(IPVYQVNNLEEICQLIIQAF). They also suggested that a CTL vaccine could
be designed using epitopes targeted by CD8+ T-cells identified in these EBOV

30

controllers.
Human pathogen-derived peptide antigens that are also recognized by C57BL/6
T-cells have been previously described. These include peptides from vesicular
stomatitis virus (VSV) RGYVYQGL [68], and human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) RGPGRAFVTI [5]. The existence of such epitopes makes a range of pre-

35

clinical vaccine experiments possible without having to rely on non-human primates and expensive and complex-to-manage humanized mouse models. Wilson
et al. showed that the EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) is an immunogen that provides protective, CTL-mediated immunity against EBOV in a C57BL/6 mouse
model and that this protection was conferred by a peptide sequence within Ebola

40

Zaire: NP43-53 (VYQVNNLEEIC) [73]. Wilson et al. came to this conclusion
based on studying splenocytes harvested from mice vaccinated with Ebola Zaire
NP using a Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) vector. Their experiments
showed that splenocytes from the vaccinated mice re-stimulated with NP43-53
had high levels of cytotoxic activity against target cells loaded with the EBOV

45

NP peptide. Remarkably, NP43-53 also happens to be an 11 amino acid subsequence of the epitope identified by Sakebe et al. as most commonly favored
for T-cell attack by survivors of the 2013-2016 EBOV outbreak in West Africa.
We set out to see if we could drive CTL expansion directed against NP43-53
to occur after vaccinating C57BL/6 mice with Ebola Zaire NP43-53 (VYQVNNLEEIC),

50

and to subsequently conduct an in-vivo EBOV challenge study to see if this peptide was protective.

We fabricated adjuvanted microspheres for this study as a room temperature
stable dry powder using the Flow Focusing process to be 11µM in diameter so
as to prevent more than one microsphere from being phagocytosed by any given
55

antigen presenting cell (APC) at the same time [37]. By loading only one peptide
sequence per microsphere, we maximized the peptide payload and mitigated the
possibility of multiple, different peptide sequences being delivered to the APC
simultaneously, which could possibly result in competitive inhibition at the motif
which could interfere with antigen presentation and subsequent T-cell expansion

60

(Supplementary Material Section 1).
We also set out to see if a similar approach to a CTL vaccine design for SARSCoV-2 would be feasible based on an analysis of the HLA binding characteristics
of peptide sequences on SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid.

2. Results
65

We used a previously described biodegradable dry powder, PLGA microsphere, synthetic vaccine platform adjuvanted with TLR-4 and TLR-9 agonists
for this study [48]. In that article, we showed that the TLR-4 and TLR-9 agonists given together with a peptide in a mouse model did not produce T-cell
expansion by ELISPOT and that microencapsulation of the peptide and the

70

TLR-9 ligand, with the TLR-4 ligand in the injectate solution, was required to
elicit an immune response to the delivered peptide antigen as determined by
ELISPOT. That study also demonstrated that the microencapsulated peptides
alone were insufficient to induce an adequate immune response without the presence of the TLR-4 and TLR-9 agonists administered as described. The TLR

75

agonists used for this vaccine formulation are used in FDA approved vaccines
and can be sourced as non-GMP or GMP material for pre-clinical and clinical
studies.
We show here that the H2-Db restricted epitopes VSV (RGYVYQGL) and
OVA (SIINFEKL), when administered to C57BL/6 mice, each produce a CD8+

80

ELISPOT response to the administered peptide antigen with no statistically

significant CD4+ response measurable by ELISPOT as shown in Figure 2c, and
Figure 2d.
We used this adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine platform to immunize
C57BL/6 mice with NP43-53, the CTL+ class I peptide antigen from the Ebola
85

Ziare NP protein identified as protective by Wilson et al. [73]. Microspheres
containing NP43-53 and CpG were prepared as a dry powder formulation and
suspended before use in a PBS injectate solution containing MPLA, and administered intradermally via injection at the base of the tail into mice as described
in a previous publication [48]. As illustrated in Figure 1c, there was no statisti-

90

cally significant difference between the ELISPOT data for the vaccinated mice
versus the response seen in the negative ELISPOT controls.
Wilson reported that protection seen in her experiment was due to a peptide sequence within NP-43-53. We hypothesized that the NP43-53 epitope
was inefficiently processed into MHC binding sub-sequences during antigen pre-

95

sentation. In order to explore possible H2-Db matches for peptide sequences
contained within Ebola Zaire NP43-53 (VYQVNNLEEIC), we prepared three
peptide vaccine formulations, each containing one of the three possible 9mer
sub-sequences within NP43-53. These sequences are shown in Table 1. We
then vaccinated, via intradermal (tail) injection, three groups of mice with mi-

100

crospheres containing one of the three 9mer sub-sequences of NP43-53 (6 per
group). ELISPOT analysis was performed, stimulating harvested splenocytes
with the three possible 9mer sub-sequences. Splenocytes from mice receiving
the NP44-52 sub-sequence had a statistically higher ELISPOT response than
mice vaccinated with the other two possible sub-sequence 9mers (P < 0.0001)

105

as shown in Figure 1a. This is consistent with the predicted H2-Db binding
affinity of YQVNNLEEI as shown in Supplementary Material Table 3.
We then loaded one population of adjuvanted microspheres with NP44-52
and a second population of adjuvanted microspheres loaded with VG19 from
EBOV Zaire NP 273-291 (VKNEVNSFKAALSSLAKHG), a Class II epitope

predicted to be relevant to NP43-53 based on the TEPITOPE algorithm using

a technique described by Cunha-Neto at al [14]. This peptide has a predicted
favorable H2-Ib binding affinity as shown in Supplementary Material Table 5.
We showed that vaccination of 6 mice with the adjuvanted microsphere vaccine loaded with VG19 and NP44-52 showed an ELISPOT response to NP44-52
115

whereas 6 mice vaccinated with adjuvanted microspheres not loaded with peptide did not (Figure 1d).
We also showed that mice vaccinated with VG19 alone did not show an
ELISPOT response to NP44-52 (Figure 2a) and, conversely, mice vaccinated
with NP44-52 did not show a response to VG19 (Figure 2b).

120

We conducted a pilot study demonstrating that intraperitoneal injection of
the adjuvanted microsphere vaccine produced a statistically superior immune
response by ELISPOT compared with the same dose delivered by intradermal
tail or intramuscular injection in C57BL/6 mice (Supplementary Material Section 2). Based on the data from that study, and the fact that the volume of

125

the intraperitoneal space would allow larger amounts of microsphere suspension
to be delivered, we chose to proceed with intraperitoneal administration for the
challenge portion of this study delivering 20mg of microspheres per dose.
We dosed three groups of mice, ten mice per group, with the adjuvanted mi-

crosphere vaccine formulation containing NP44-52 and VG-19, with each peptide

in a distinct microsphere population, and challenged these mice 14 days after
vaccine administration with escalating IP administered doses of mouse adapted
EBOV (maEBOV) (Group 3 - 100 PFU, Group 5 - 1000 PFU and Group 7 10,000 PFU). The composition of the vaccine used for the exposure study is
described in Supplementary Material Section 3. A second set of three control

135

groups of mice (groups 2, 4 and 6), ten mice per group (mock groups), received
PBS buffer solution alone and served as control animals for the study and were
similarly challenged with maEBOV. Group 1 animals served as study controls
and received no PBS buffer, vaccine or maEBOV injections. All mice were
sourced from Jackson Labs and were 6-8 weeks of age and 15-25 grams at the

140

time of vaccination. The dosing regimen is outlined in Table 2.
Peak mortality across all groups tested was seen in mice challenged with
1,000 PFU maEBOV versus PBS buffer control as shown in the survival curve in
Figure 3a. Clinical observation data shown in Figure 3b and Figure 3c and daily
weight data shown in Figure 3d and Figure 3e show protection from morbidity

145

in all active vaccinated mice exposed to 1,000 PFU maEBOV.
PBS buffer mock-vaccinated mice showed mortality increasing from the 100
PFU to 1,000 PFU as shown in Figure 4a and Figure 3a. We saw a paradoxical
effect in control animals with survival increasing between 1,000PFU (Figure 3a)
and 10,000 PFU (Figure 5a). We believe this was caused by innate immunity

150

triggered by the very large maEBOV challenge. All mice in all vaccinated
groups across both experiments survived and showed no morbidity by clinical
observation scores and weight data.
For each of the three challenge levels, the difference between the number of
survivors in the vaccinated group versus the PBS control group was statistically

155

significant by chi square (100 PFU P = 0.001; 1000 PFU P = 0.0003; 10,000
PFU P = 0.003).
We saw what appears to be an innate immune response at the 10,000 PFU
EBOV exposure level. It has been suggested that EBOV can mediate an innate
immunity response through stimulation of TLR-4 [33]. Because the adjuvanted

160

microsphere vaccine used in this experiment incorporates a TLR-4 agonist, we
dosed 10 mice with adjuvanted microspheres without peptides and found the
level of protection after exposure to 100 PFU EBOV to be statistically no different from that seen in PBS buffer controls (Supplementary Material Figure
1). We conclude that level of protection conferred by the adjuvanted vaccine de-

165

scribed in this study is dependant on delivering peptides with the microspheres.
The data in Supplementary Material Figure 1 also shows, in two separate experiments conducted months apart with the same 100 PFU maEBOV challenge
dose and the same (active) vaccine formulation, that the vaccinated animals in
both active groups had 100% survival and no morbidity by clinical observation.

170

This provides some evidence that the protective effect of vaccination using this
adjuvanted microsphere vaccine is reproducible.
Serum samples from sacrificed animals exposed to EBOV who did not receive
vaccine were quantitatively assayed for various cytokines using BioPlex plates.
Animals having unwitnessed demise did not have serum samples collected. A

175

Pearson Correlation Analysis was performed to assess relationships between
specific cytokine levels and survival. The results are shown in Table 3.
We observed low levels of IL-6 in surviving mice. NHPs infected with EBOV
have been determined by other researchers to have elevated levels of IL-6 in
plasma and serum [27][17]. EBOV infected humans have also shown elevated IL-

180

6 levels and these elevated levels have been associated with increased mortality
[71].
Similarly, we observed low levels of MCP-1, IL-9 and GM-CSF in survivors.
Increased serum and plasma levels of MCP-1 have been observed in EBOV
infected NHPs [22][27][17] and elevated levels of MCP-1 were associated with

185

fatalities in EBOV infected human subjects [71]. Human survivors of EBOV
have been found to have very low levels of circulating cytokines IL-9 and elevated
levels of GM-CSF have been associated with fatality in humans exposed to
EBOV [71].
We saw increased levels of IF N − γ in survivors. Other vaccine studies have

190

associated IF N − γ with protection [70][38].

We achieved protection against maEBOV challenge with a single injection
of an adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine loaded with a class I peptide in a
region on EBOV nucleocapsid favored for CD8+ attack by survivors of the 20132016 West Africa EBOV outbreak. There is evidence that a CTL response could
195

be beneficial in the context of a coronavirus infection. [13][41][64][11][28][36]
Peng et al. have found survivors of the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak who had circulating T-cells targeting SARS-CoV-1 nucleocapsid two years after initial infection. [42] We decided to investigate the feasibility of designing a SARS-CoV-2
peptide vaccine targeting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid.

200

All available SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences were obtained from the NCBI
viral genomes resource within GenBank, an NIH genetic sequence database [8].
Retrieved sequences were processed using multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
via Clustal for the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein [34]. The nucleocapsid phosphoprotein sequences were trimmed down to every possible peptide sequence

205

9 amino acids in length. 9mers were chosen because they typically represent
the optimal length for binding to the vast majority of HLA [1][18][3]. The resulting peptides were compared to the MSA to ensure than these sequences are
conserved within all of the sequencing samples available and not affected by
an amino acid variant that could complicate subsequent analysis, specifically

210

the calculation of population coverage. A selection of HLA were selected to
encompass the vast majority of the worlds population at over 97% coverage.
Peptides were run through artificial intelligence algorithms, netMHC and
netMHCpan which were developed using training data from in-vitro binding
studies. The pan variant of netMHC is able to integrate in-vitro data from a

215

variety of HLA to allow for predictions to be made if limited in-vitro data is
available for the specified target HLA [30][1]. This in-silico analysis utilizes the
neural networks ability to learn from the in-vitro data and report back predicted values based on the imputed SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein
peptides. Peptides with a predicted HLA IC50 binding affinity of 500nm or less

220

in either of the algorithms, were included in the candidate list of targets for the
vaccine [30][1][40].

A subset of these SARS-CoV-2 peptide sequences are present on SARSCoV-1 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and as a result had in-vitro binding data in

previous outbreak [65]. Predicted values of these peptides were cross referenced
with actual in-vitro binding measurements from identical 9mer peptides when
that data was available.

3. Summary and Discussion
Most preventative vaccines are designed to elicit a humoral immune response,
230

typically via the administration of whole protein from a pathogen. Antibody
vaccines typically do not produce a robust T-cell response. [72] A T-cell vaccine
is meant to elicit a cellular immune response directing CD8+ cells to expand
and attack cells presenting the HLA Class I restricted pathogen-derived peptide
antigen. [47] Difficulty in obtaining a reliable immune response from peptide

235

antigens and the HLA restricted nature of CTL vaccines have limited their utility to protect individuals from infectious disease [77]. However, observations
derived from individuals able to control HIV infection [43] and EBOV infection
[50] demonstrating that control may be associated with specific CTL targeting
behavior, suggest that there may be an important role for HLA-restricted pep-

240

tide vaccines for protection against infectious disease for which development of
an effective traditional whole protein vaccine has proved to be difficult. The
adjuvanted microsphere peptide vaccine platform described here incorporates
unmodified peptides making possible rapid manufacture and deployment to respond to a new viral threat.

NP44-52 is located within one of the EBOV nucleocapsid proteins considered
essential for virus replication. This epitope resides in a sequence conserved
across multiple EBOV strains as shown in Supplementary Material Figure 6.
 structure for NP and VP24 is shown for context in Figure 6a [67]. A
A 7.3A
 resolution structure rendering for EBOV NP shown in Figure 6b illustrates

250

that NP44-52 is a buried structural loop, which is likely to be important to the
structural integrity of the EBOV NP protein [16]. This structural role of NP4452 likely explains its conservation across EBOV strains.
CTL targeting of the EBOV NP protein has been described [42][64][28]
[49][24]. Nucleocapisid proteins are essential for EBOV replication [61]. Re-

255

cent advances in T-cell based vaccines have focused on avoiding all variable
viral epitopes and incorporating only conserved regions [7][25]. EBOV NP may
be more conserved than nucleocapsid proteins VP35 and VP24 making it more
suitable as a CTL vaccine target [9][73]. The nucleocapsid proteins in SARSCoV-1 are also essential for that virus to function normally [10]. This suggests

260

that a CTL vaccine targeting coronavirus nucleocapsid could be effective against
SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2.
We have shown that an H2-Db restricted Class I peptide exists within the
NP41-60 epitope identified by Sakebe et al. as the most commonly favored NP
epitope for CD8+ attack by survivors of the 2013-1016 EBOV outbreak in West

265

Africa. We have demonstrated, when delivered in conjunction with a predicted11

EBOV can cause severe pulmonary problems in exposed subjects [39]. These
problems can be especially severe when the virus is delivered by aerosol [15][31].
Interaction of EBOV specific antibody, NHP lung tissue and EBOV delivered
to NHPs via aerosol can produce a more lethal effect than in NHPs without

275

circulating anti-EBOV antibody exposed to aerosolized EBOV (unpublished
conference presentation). This suggests that a CTL vaccine may be more effective for prophylaxis against filovirus protection than an antibody vaccine if the
anticipated route of EBOV exposure is via aerosol.
Sakebe et al. identified A*30:01:01 as the only HLA type common to all

280

four survivors in their study with CD8+ targeting of NP41-60. The A*30 supertype is relatively common in West Africa: 13.3% for Mali, 15.4% for Kenya,
16.3% for Uganda, and 23.9% for Mozambique [32]. Although peptide vaccines
are by their nature HLA restricted, it may be possible to create a CTL vaccine
directed against EBOV for use alone or in conjunction with a whole protein vac-

285

cine to produce an antibody response in tandem, by incorporating additional
Class I peptides from epitopes targeted by controllers to broaden the HLA coverage of the vaccine. MHC binding algorithms hosted by the IEDB predict that
YQVNNLEEI will bind strongly to the MHC of HLA-A*02:06, HLA-A*02:03
and HLA-A*02:01 individuals (Supplementary Material Table 2) [65]. HLA-

population (Supplementary Material Table 4) [65]. Taken together, a peptide
vaccine based on YQVNNLEEI and VKNEVNSFKAALSSLAKHG could produce a cellular immune response in about 50% of the population of the Sudan

and about 30% of the population of North America.
The internal proteins located within influenza virus, in contrast to the gly12

coproteins present on the surface, show a high degree of conservation. Epitopes
within these internal proteins often stimulate T-cell-mediated immune responses
[57]. As a result, vaccines stimulating influenza specific T-cell immunity have
300

been considered as candidates for a universal influenza vaccine [66].
SARS-CoV-1 infection survivors have been found to have a persistent CTL
response to SARS-CoV-1 nucleocapsid two years after infection. [42] This suggests that the same approach could be applied to SARS-CoV-2 which has conserved regions in nucleocapsid which is located within the virus (see multiple

305

sequence alignment in Supplementary Material Figure 7 and Supplementary
Material Figure 8). Antigenic escape allows a virus to retain fitness despite
an immune response to vaccination [20]. Picking conserved regions for vaccine
targeting is an important part of mitigating this problem. Coronavirus spike
protein, for example, may be particularly susceptible to mutation meaning that

310

antigenic escape would be likely if the spike protein was targeted by a coronavirus vaccine, making it difficult to achieve durable protection. [74] A recent
paper conducted a population genetic analysis of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes
showing that the virus has evolved into two major types: L and S, with changes
in their relative frequency after the outbreak possibly due to human intervention

315

resulting in selection pressure [62].
We took all possible 424 9mer peptide sequences from the SARS-CoV-2
nucleocapsid protein sequences available and evaluated each peptide for HLA
restriction using NetMHC 4.0 and NetMHCpan 4.0 [65][30][1]. We analyzed
9mer peptide sequences because these are often associated with superior MHC

320

binding properties than class I peptides of other lengths [63][18]. We found
53 unique peptides with predicted binding below 500nM from NetMHC 4.0
and/or NetMHCpan 4.0. These results are shown in Supplementary Material
Table 6, Supplementary Material Table 7, Supplementary Material Table 8 and
Supplementary Material Table 9.

325

We proceeded to determine the predicted HLA population coverage of a
vaccine incorporating all 53 peptides using median values of the ANN, SMM,
NetMHC 4.0 and NetMHCpan 4.0 algorithms hosted by IEDB [65]. These 53

peptides, taken together, had predicted HLA coverage of greater than 97% of
the world’s population as shown in Supplementary Material Table 10. We also
330

calculated HLA coverage based on alleles specific to populations in China and
found that coverage across those individuals could be expected to be within
3% percent of the world wide coverage estimate as shown in Supplementary
Material Table 11. This same population coverage could be achieved with 16 of
the 53 unique peptides as shown in Table 4.

335

Seven of the 53 peptides with a predicted HLA match have been tested
in-vitro for HLA binding affinity by various researchers [65]. These binding
affinity assays were originally performed with the SARS virus during a previous
outbreak. Specific literature references for these in-vitro assays for each peptide sequence are as follows: ASAFFGMSR, LSPRWYFYY, QQQGQTVTK:

340

[53], FPRGQGVPI: [53][26][46][60], GMSRIGMEV: [26][64][13][41][12], KTFPPTEPK: [53][26][45][60][6] and LLLDRLNQL: [41][13][12][64][78]. These seven
peptides are shown in red in Supplementary Material Table 6 and Supplementary Material Table 7.
The remaining 46 SARS-CoV-2 peptides listed in could also be further qual-

345

ified as potential vaccine candidates by confirming MHC binding predictions by
in-vitro binding affinity and/or binding stability studies [54][52][26]. Another
approach to evaluating the 53 SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccine peptides though
in-vitro testing is also possible.
As we have shown in this paper, a peptide targeted by EBOV controllers

350

could form the basis of a preventative vaccine for EBOV. ELISPOT analysis of
PBMCs taken from the peripheral blood of COVID-19 controllers and progressors to assess the presence of a differential response to the 53 peptides could lead
to a broadly applicable protective CTL vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 by incorporating peptides into the vaccine that are more commonly targeted for CD8+

355

attack by the controllers versus the progressors. A peptide vaccine for SARSCoV-2, unlike a typical antibody vaccine, is not limited to virus surface antigen
targets. This provides opportunities to attack other targets on SARS-CoV-2
besides spike which may be prone to mutation [74].

In addition, a peptide vaccine mitigates the risk of Antibody Disease En360

hancement (ADE) seen in the context of a non-neutralizing antibody response to
a whole protein vaccine [75][55]. Also, neutralizing antibodies directed against
spike protein in SARS-CoV-1 patients have been associated with an increased
risk of Acute Lung Injury (ALI)[35]. Specifically, patients succumbing to SARSCoV-1 were found to develop a neutralizing antibody (NAb) response to spike

365

protein faster than survivors after the onset of symptoms and the NAb titers
were higher in the patients who died compared with those who recovered[76]. To
the extent to which antibody vaccines producing an antibody response against
the spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 could increase the risk of ALI, this risk could
also be mitigated by a using peptide vaccine as an alternative approach.

370

The extent of the COVID-19 outbreak should allow many more controllers
to be identified than the thirty individuals studied by Sakabe and the seven
individuals identified in the Peng study [42][50]. Furthermore, Sakebe and Peng
did not report progressor data perhaps because of the difficulty in obtaining
blood samples from those patients. If researchers act now during the COVID-

375

19 outbreak, perhaps controller and progressor blood samples could be collected
and prospectively analyzed, quickly creating a database of optimal candidate
class I peptides for inclusion into a CTL vaccine with potentially broad HLA
coverage for subsequent rapid manufacture and deployment. It would be interesting to see the extent to which the peptides favored by controllers appear

380

on SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, making SARS-CoV-2 a second example, across
two different viruses, of controllers exhibiting CTL attack preferentially on the
nucleocapsid protein.

mice were vaccinated (2mg adjuvanted microspheres via ID tail injection) with a different
9mer peptide sub-sequence of NP43-53. ELISPOT data showed NP44-52 produced the best
immune response (1a). Mice vaccinated (2mg adjuvanted microspheres via ID tail injection)
with the NP43-53 11mer produced the same immune response as ELISPOT plate negative
control (1c). The same active formulation administered to mice for the challenge study (20mg

compared with both adjuvanted microsphere and ELISPOT plate controls (1d). (n.s. = not

ELISPOT responses evaluating total, CD8, and CD4 cell populations after vaccination (2mg

For both peptides, the immune response by 31
