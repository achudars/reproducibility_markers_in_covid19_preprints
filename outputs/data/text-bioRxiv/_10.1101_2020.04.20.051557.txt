Abstract
Background: To date, no specific vaccine or drug has been proven to be effective for SARS-CoV-2
infection. Therefore, we implemented immunoinformatics approach to design an efficient multi-epitopes
vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
Results: The designed vaccine construct has several immunodominant epitopes from structural proteins of
Spike, Nucleocapsid, Membrane and Envelope. These peptides promote cellular and humoral immunity
and Interferon gamma responses. In addition, these epitopes have antigenicity ability and no allergenicity
probability. To enhance the vaccine immunogenicity, we used three potent adjuvants; Flagellin, a driven
peptide from high mobility group box 1 as HP-91 and human beta defensin 3 protein. The
physicochemical and immunological properties of the vaccine structure were evaluated. Tertiary structure
of the vaccine protein was predicted and refined by I-Tasser and galaxi refine and validated using
Rampage and ERRAT. Results of Ellipro showed 242 residues from vaccine might be conformational B
cell epitopes. Docking of vaccine with Toll-Like Receptors 3, 5 and 8 proved an appropriate interaction
between the vaccine and receptor proteins. In silico cloning demonstrated that the vaccine can be
efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli.
Conclusions: The designed multi epitope vaccine is potentially antigenic in nature and has the ability to
induce humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. This vaccine can interact
appropriately with the TLR3, 5, and 8. Also, this vaccine has high quality structure and suitable
characteristics such as high stability and potential for expression in Escherichia coli.
Key words: SARS-CoV-2, multi-epitope vaccine, structural proteins, humoral immunity, cellular

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which the cause of COVID-19 disease,
was first reported as a pneumonia epidemic in the Chinese city of Wuhan (Hubei province) in December
31, 2019 belongs to the Beta coronavirus genus[1-3]. Coronaviruses are positive-sense single-stranded
RNA viruses. They belong to the order of Nidovirales and superfamily of orthocoronaviridae. This
superfamily has four genus including: alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronaviruses. Gamma and delta
coronaviruses infect birds, while alpha and beta coronaviruses generally infect mammals such as human.
In immunocompetent individuals, they generally cause mild respiratory infections, such as common cold,
while in some humans coronavirus infections cause serious disease, such as SARS (Severe Acute
Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) epidemics.
The SARS-CoV-2, the viral cause of COVID-19, has a large mRNA genome, 26 to 32 kb in length,
meaning a 5' cap cover structure and a 3' polyadenylated. This encodes several structural and
nonstructural proteins. Among structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and
nucleocapsid (N) proteins are important in inducing immune responses [3-5].Protein S is the main tool for
virus entry into the cell, which interacts with host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
ACE2 is a metallopeptidase expressed in variant tissues, including alveolar epithelial cells, fibroblasts,
endothelial cells, and enterocytes. [6-10].The N protein is an essential RNA-binding protein for
transcription and replication of the viral RNA. It has the significant roles in forming of the helical
ribonucleoproteins during packaging the RNA genome, regulating of viral RNA synthesis during
replication, transcription and modulating of metabolism in the infected cells [11-14]. T cell responses
against the S and N proteins of SARS-CoV virus are most dominant and long-lived than other structural
proteins[15]. protein E has an important role in the assembly of the viral genome[16, 17].The M protein
plays a pivotal role in virus assembly,budding and replication of virus particles in the host cells[18].
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted quickly and causes considerable fatality rate, so that World Health
Organization (WHO) reported over 2 114 269 confirmed cases globally and at least 145 144 deaths
because of this disease until April 17, 2020[19]. There is currently no vaccine or approved treatment for

this disease. One of the major challenges for scientists in dealing with the new coronavirus pandemic will
be to get a useful and effective vaccine. For this reason, trying to develop an effective vaccine to control
the virus has been the subject of research by many scientists around the world [4, 20-22]. However,
achieving such a vaccine with conventional methods is very time consuming and expensive. As such, in
silico prediction of the vaccine targets is very important because the targets can be selected with a more
open eye in a limited time and resources. Bioinformatic approaches are very helpful to identify the
effective epitopes and developing vaccine. Several vaccines for virus diseases were designed based on
these approaches that include effective vaccines on Human papilloma viridea (HPV) [23],Ebola [24],
Zika[25]and MERS[26, 27]viruses. There are also few reports of a vaccine candidate for COVID19[28,
29]. These vaccines contained multiple cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and B cell epitopes against
several proteins of SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, those vaccines didn’t protect against all structural
immunodominant proteins of virus. Therefore, to overwhelm these limitations, we designed a multiepitope peptide vaccine consisted of S, M, N, and E viral proteins. The vaccine has appropriate
physicochemical properties such as stability at room temperature, antigenic capability, and no possibility
of allergy. This multi-epitope vaccine consists of three epitopes from S protein and one epitope from each
of M, N, and E proteins, respectively. Each of the epitopes has a high ability to stimulate humoral and
cellular immune responses, especially the proper production of Interferon gamma (IFN-γ). In addition, we
used appropriate adjuvants in the vaccine structure to potentiate the immunogenicity of the antigens.
Therefore, we incorporated the potent adjuvants of N and C terminus of Flagellin as a toll like receptor
(TLR) 5, a driven peptide from high mobility group box1 (HMGB1) as HP-91 and human beta defensin

(HBD-3) in the construct of the vaccine. The vaccine segments were connected to each other by
appropriate linkers. Physicochemical properties, structural stability, and immunological characterizations
of the vaccine were evaluated. Modeling, refinement, and validation were performed to access a high
quality three dimensional (3D) structure of the vaccine protein. Docking evaluation showed an
appropriate interaction between the vaccine and TLRs 3, 5 and 8. In silico cloning showed that the

vaccine could be effectively expressed in E.coli. Totally, a potential vaccine candidate with proper
immunological and stable physicochemical properties against SARS-CoV-2 was designed. It is expected
the vaccine could be capable to protect humans from COVID19 disease.
2. Methodology
2.1 Protein sequence retrieval
The protein sequences of spike glycoprotein (accession number of QIC53213.1), nucleocapsid

(QHU79211.1),

membrane

glycoprotein

(QIC53207.1)

and

(QIC53215.1) were driven using NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) databases and saved in FASTA
format for subsequent analysis.
2.2 Screening of potential epitopes
2.2.1 Screening of Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) epitopes
MHC-I humans alleles with 9 mer length were selected using IEDB (www.iedb.org) database through
IEDB

recommended

online

server

(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHC/).IEDB (Instructor/Evaluator Database) is a repository of webbased tools which predicts and analysis of immune epitopes. It uses a consensus method based on
artificial neural network (ANN), stabilized matrix method (SMM), and Combinatorial Peptide Libraries
(CombLib), if any corresponding predictor is available for the peptide sequence [30-48]. NetMHC 4.0
software is a free server for the prediction of peptide-MHCI binding affinity by gapped sequence
alignment. Prediction methods of this server are based on alignments that include insertions and deletions
and

have significantly higher performance than methods based on peptides of single lengths

methods[32].
2.2.2 Screening of Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes

Prediction of CTL epitopes was done by an online server CTL Pred. This method is based on quantitative
matrix (QM) and machine learning techniques for example, artificial neural network (ANN) and support
vector machine (SVM).The server also uses the consensus and combined prediction approaches. The
consensus and combined prediction approaches are more specific and sensitive, respectively, in
comparison with individual approaches such as ANN and SVM[49].
2.2.3 Screening of Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-II epitopes
IEDB database (IEDB recommended 2.22 method) [40, 50-53] (www.iedb.org) and RANKPEP online
server (http://imed.med.ucm.es/Tools/rankpep.html) were employed for screening of HLA-II epitope. The
database of IEDB was described previously. The RANKPEP server predicts MHC-II binding epitope by
position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) that are structurally consistent with the binding mode of
MHC-II ligands [54].
2.2.4 Screening of Linear B cell epitopes
Prediction of linear B cell epitope was done by IEDB[55] (Emini surface accessibility method) and
BepiPred software. BepiPred 2.0 predicts the location of linear B-cell epitopes by a combination of a
hidden Markov model and a propensity scale method. The epitope Threshold of this server was selected
0.5[56].
2.3 Selection of the epitope segments
The results of all the above predictions were pooled and compared together, and the regions with the
highest overlaps were determined. These immunodominant regions were employed for future analyses to
finally select the most appropriate epitope domains for vaccine construct.
2.4 In silico analyzing of IFN-γ inducing epitopes
IFN epitope server (http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/ifnepitope) was employed for determining the induce
IFN-γ production ability in the selected epitopes. This web server classifies MHC binder epitopes into

IFN-γ inducing (positive numbers) and non-inducing IFN-γ (negative numbers) using several methods
such as; motifs-based search, machine learning technique and a hybrid approach. Accuracy of Best
prediction based on hybrid approach in this software is 82.10%[57].
2.5 Evaluation of antigenicity
Antigencity of epitopes was assessed by ANTIGENpro (http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu/) and
VaxiJen v2.0 (http://www.ddg-pharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.html) servers. Web server of
ANTIGENpro is the first sequence-based, alignment-free, and pathogen independent predictor, using
protein antigenicity microarray data for predicting the protein antigenicity[58]. VaxiJen is also the first
server for prediction of antigens. This server applies a new alignment-independent approach that is based
on auto-cross covariance (ACC) transformation of protein sequences into uniform vectors of principal
amino acid properties. Depending on the target organism (bacteria, virus or tumor) accuracy of this server
varies from 70% to 89%. The Threshold of this server was selected 0.5[59, 60].
2.6 Allergenicity assessment of predicted epitopes
For predicting protein allergenicity with a high accuracy, the software of AllergenFP v.1.0 (http://ddgpharmfac.net/AllergenFP/) was used. This is an online server that identifies allergens based on amino acid
principle properties such as hydrophobicity, helix and β-strand forming with accuracy about 88% [40].
2.7 Vaccine engineering, evaluation of physicochemical properties, antigenicity and allergenicity
According to the results of the previous steps, four epitopes from S protein, two epitope from N protein
and one epitope from E protein were selected to be incorporated in the vaccine construction. The whole
construction was designed using joining these epitopes to two adjuvant sequences of N and C terminals of
Flagellin and the synthesis peptide of HP-91.Various segments of the designed-vaccine connected to each
other by suitable linkers.

After designing the vaccine, Several physicochemical parameters including molecular weight, theoretical
isoelectric point (pI), total number of positive and negative residues, extinction coefficient,
Instability index, half-life, aliphatic index, and grand average hydropathy (GRAVY) were computed
using Expasy's ProtParam at http://us.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html [61]. Antigenicity of the final
vaccine construct was evaluated using vaxijen v2.0 and ANTIGENpro and allergenicity was assayed by
AllergenFP v.1.0 server.

using

the I-TASSER

software

(https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/) [61].This server showed five models as a result of the
prediction. This model was accepted as a vaccine structure with the highest reliability score (c-sore) and
was refined using Galaxy Refine web services. It successfully tested in CASP10 (Critical assessment of
techniques for protein structure prediction) experiments. This server refines the whole protein with gentle
and aggressive relaxation methods. This first reconstructs all side-chain conformations and repeatedly
relaxes the structure with short molecular dynamics simulations after side-chain repacking perturbations
[62].Finally, Galaxy Refine showed five structures as refined models of vaccine structure. The
RAMPAGE

(http://mordred.bioc.cam.ac.uk/~rapper/rampage.php),

and

ERRAT

(http://services.mbi.ucla.edu/ERRAT/) servers were used to validate the refined 3D structures obtained
from Galaxy Refine web service. [63, 64]. Finally, the refined and high-quality 3D structure of the
vaccine was observed by PyMOL software v2.1.1.PyMOL is an open-source that widely used for
bimolecular function[65].
2.9 Prediction of discontinuous B cell epitope
Discontinuous B-cell epitopes were predicted from the 3D vaccine structure using Ellipro in IEDB
database (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/tools/ElliPro).ElliPro is a useful research tool for identifying
immunoepitopes in protein antigens which implements Thornton's method and with a residue clustering

algorithm.The MODELLER program and the Jmol viewer allow the prediction and visualization of
immunoepitopes in a given protein sequence or structure. In comparison with six other structure-based
methods that are using for epitope prediction, ElliPro performs the best prediction and gave an AUC
value of 0.732, when the most significant prediction is considered for each protein. [66].
2.10 Molecular docking with TLR- 3, 5 and 8
The first, tertiary structure of the human TLR-3, 5, and 8 was obtained from PDB database
(www.rcsb.org) with codes of 3J0A, 5GS0 and 3w3g, respectively. Next, protein-protein docking of the
vaccine structure (as ligand) and each TLR (as receptor) was performed by CLUSPRO 2.0 online server
(cluspro.bu.edu/login.php). CLUSPRO 2.0 is a fully automated and fast rigid-body protein–protein
docking server. This server evaluates docking of two interacting proteins based on three techniques: first,
the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) correlation approach, second, clustering of the best energy
conformations, third, refining the obtained model using short Monte Carlo simulations and the
medium‐range optimization method SDU [67-69].
2.11 Codon optimization and in silico cloning
The reverse translation of the designed-vaccine gene sequence was performed by Sequence Manipulation
Suite (https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/rev_trans.html) to prepare a suitable vaccine sequence for
cloning and expression in an appropriate expression system. The properties of sequence gene such as
Codon Adaptation Index (CAI), GC content, and Codon Frequency and Distribution (CFD) have the key
roles in attaining a high-level of protein expression in the host were evaluated using GenScript online
server (https://www.genscript.com/tools/rare-codon-analysis)[24]. Finally, the restriction sites of XhoI
and EcoRV were respectively added to the N- and C-terminus of the vaccine DNA sequence using CLC
Sequence viewer v8.0 (http://www.cacbio.com) to facilitate the cloning in E. coli expression system.

Protein S, M, N, and E were used to predict HLA-І binding epitopes (HLA-A, B, and C) using IEDB and
NetMHC 4. CTL Pred server was used to predict CTL epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins.
HLA-II binding epitope (DP, DQ, and DR) from these proteins were predicted using RANKEP and IEDB
servers. Prediction of linear B cell epitopes was performed by BepiPred and IEDB. Finally, the obtained
epitopes from the comparison of above analyses were applied to future selection (Table.1).
3.2. Antigenic protein screening and avoid allerginicity
All selected peptides were submitted to the IFNepitope server for evaluation their ability to induce IFN-γ.
Allergenicity probability of epitopes evaluated by AllergenFPE valuation of epitope antigenicity was
performed by ANTIGEN pro and VaxiJen v2.0.The six epitopes (three from S and one from each of E, M,
N proteins) that had the highest ability in IFN-γ induction, low allergenicity and potent antigenic ability
were chosen to be used in the vaccine structure (Table 1).
3.3 Designing a multi-epitopes vaccine construct
Six epitopes with high score which selected to be incorporated in the final vaccine construct were the
sequences of 20-49, 418-446, and 505-534 from S, 51-71 from E, 360-388 from N and 198-214 from M
protein. In addition, three immunopotent adjuvants Flagellin, HP-91, and HBD-3 were also added to the
vaccine structure. The vaccine pieces were linked to each other by using a short linker sequence of LE
dipeptide repeats. The final multi epitope peptide vaccine was 473 amino acid residues (Fig.1).
4.3 Immunological and physicochemical properties of the vaccine structure
To evaluate antigenicity of the whole protein vaccine, the ‘‘virus’’ option was chosen as a target
organism. The antigenicity of 0.5319 (probable antigen) was estimated at 0.5% threshold for the virus
model. Assessment of antigenicity by Antigen pro showed this vaccine is high antigenic with antigenicity
of 0.941411. AllergenFP showed that the T cell epitomes in the vaccine protein are non-allergen. The
molecular weight (MW) and theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of the vaccine protein were computed as
51.916kDa and 7.45, respectively. The predicted half-lives were calculated as 30 hour (h) (mammalian

reticulocytes, in vitro), 20 h (yeast, in vivo), and 10 h (E. coli, in vivo). The instability index was 35.77,
indicating that the protein vaccine was stable enough (Table.2)
5.3 Tertiary structure modeling, refinement, and validation
The primary 3D model of the protein vaccine construct was predicted using I-TASSER. The server
suggested the top five models for the protein vaccine with C scores ranging from -5 to +2. The C score of
the selected model was 2.97, which was the highest score of C. Then, selected I-TASSER model was
refined by GalaxyRefine software. The quality of the designed-vaccine was evaluated using the
Ramachandran plot in the RAMPAGE server and characteristic atomic interaction in the ERRAT server.
The RAMPAGE results of the final model showed that the majority of residues (89.6%) are located in the
favored region and 6.4% are in allowed, and only 4% of residues are the outlier. The ERRAT result
showed that the refined model has the ERRAT score 87.955 (Fig.2). The outputs of the Ramachandran
plot and ERRAT indicated that the refined 3D structure is good and therefore, can be utilized as a reliable
model for further evaluations.
6.3 Conformational B-cell epitope Identification
Tertiary structure of the designed vaccine was used as an input for conformational (discontinuous) B cell
epitope prediction via Ellipro in IEDB. From 472 amino acid residues, 247 were defined as discontinues
B cell epitope.
7.3 Identifying binding sites and protein–protein docking.
ClusPro server has been used to perform the docking of the vaccine with TLR3, 5, and 8 molecules.
Cluspro generated thirty models for each of interaction. The docked model was selected based on most
atoms interacted in the vaccine and each of receptors (Figures 3 to 5).
8.3 In silico codon optimisation of the vaccine construct

The reverse translation of the protein vaccine into a nucleotide sequence was performed simultaneously
using the Seipence Manipulation Suite server to express high-level protein in E. coli. Codon Adaptation
Index (CAI), GC content and Codon Frequency and Distribution (CFD) were evaluated using GenScript
online server. A CAI of the vaccine optimized nucleotide sequence was 1. The GC content of the
structure was in the ideal range of 55.78% (30-70%), and CFD100 indicating the effective expression of
the protein in the host. To clone the gene into E. coli vectors, XhoI and EcoRV restriction sites were
added into the N- and C-terminals of the sequence using CLC Sequence viewer v.8. Finally, the vaccine
gene was inserted into the PET-28 vector (Fig.6).
4. Discussion:
To date, there remains an utmost need to design efficient vaccines in order to halt the inexorable spread of
COVID19. In light of recent advances in bioinformatics approaches, we can identify immunodominant T
and B cell epitopes and design a potential vaccine to prevent the disease. We used an in silico analysis to
design a potent multi-epitope peptide vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine contains 472 amino
acids which constructed from three specific epitopes from S (receptor-binding domain) and one epitope
from each of the structural proteins of E, M, and N. These proteins have essential roles in infection of host
cells and host immune modulation. Therefore, it is expected that the vaccine will have a high ability to
induce the production of neutralizing antibodies by B lymphocytes and the production of IFN-γ by (T
helper) Th and CTL cells.
Adjuvants are essential components of multi-epitope vaccines, because they increase immunologic
properties of the vaccine structures. We used Flagellin, a TLR5 agonist, in two N and C terminous of the
vaccine construct. Flagellin induces innate immune effectors such as cytokines and nitric oxide[70, 71],
activate of TLR5-positive DCs, neutrophils and epithelial cells[72-75] and stimulate the activation of
adaptive immune responses mainly Th2-type and IgA production [72, 73, 76-79]. Intranasal
administration of Flagellin stimulates the signaling of TLR5 in lung epithelial cells and pneumonocytes
[80]. It was used broadly as adjuvant in vaccine structure designed against viral infections such as

influenza [79, 81, 82] and HPV[23, 83]. In addition, we incorporated HP-91 and HBD-3 in the final
vaccine construct. The peptide of HP-91 derived from B-box domain amino acids of 89-108 from
HMGB1 protein. This peptide induces high levels of IL-2 and IL-15, increases secretion of IL-12 and
IFN-α in human DCs and augmented T cell activation[84]. Also, It activates (Dendritic cells) DCs
independent of TLR2, 4, and 9, and MyD88 pathways[85].This is a potent immune adjuvant for inducing
cellular and humoral immune responses and used in vaccines against viral infection such as HIV and
HPV [84-87]. HBD-3 is the third adjuvant in our vaccine, used as adjuvant to viruses such as influenza
and MERS-CoV [26, 88]. This peptide blocks viral fusion using creating a protective barricade of
immobilized surface proteins[88]. It activates APCs via TLR1 and TLR2[89] and induces IL-22[90],
TGF-α[91, 92] and IFN-γ[93, 94]. It has been implicated in the chemotaxis of immature DCs and T cells
via its interaction with chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) and the chemotaxis of monocytes via interaction
with CCR2[95], As well as this peptide activates NK cells , promotes and activates myeloid DCs directly
and dependent Natural killer (NK) activity[89, 94]. For linking the different pieces of the vaccine, a
repeated of a dipeptide linker of LE was used. This linker improves the expression of vaccine protein via
decreasing the pI [96, 97].
An efficient vaccine should not only have stimulating ability immune response but also possess good
physicochemical properties during production, formulation, storage and consumption. According to the
results of bioinformatics predictions, the designed vaccine was stable with a stability index of 35.77 and
had pI of 7.45. Conformational B cell epitopes have a central role in induction humoral responses. The
accessible of a significant number of B cell epitopes in the vaccine molecule indicates the high capability
of this structure in the stimulation of B lymphocytes. The binding affinity of the vaccine with immune
receptor (TLR3, 5 and 8) is necessary to effectively transport vaccine protein into antigen presenting
cells. The results of docking analysis showed the vaccine protein properly interact with TLR3, 5, and 8.

In this study, using a variety of bioinformatics methods, we developed a multi-epitope subunit vaccine
against the SARS-Cov-2 virus. The results of this study showed that it could be possible to predict
vaccine candidates against new emerging viral diseases such as COVID-19 with the help of reverse
vaccinology. The present study, with its effective vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2, showed that
bioinformatics approaches could help to develop effective treatments for other emerging infectious
diseases in a short time and at low cost. However, the in silico results of this study need to be verified
using laboratory and animal models.

Fig.6. Evaluation of the three important parameters of the codon-optimized gene to express high level
protein in E.coli. A) CAI of the gene sequence was 1. It is noted that a CAI of > 0.8 will be considered as
good for expression in the selected host. B) Average GC content of the sequence was 55.78%. C) Codon
frequency distribution (CFD) value of the gene sequence is 100. A CFD equal to100 supports maximum
protein expression in the desired host. D) Insertion of the vaccine gene in the PET28 vector by restriction
enzymes of XhoI and EcoRV.
