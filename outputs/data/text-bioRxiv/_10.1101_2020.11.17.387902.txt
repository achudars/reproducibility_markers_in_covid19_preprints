Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections have resulted in a number
of severe cases of COVID-19 and deaths worldwide. However, knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infection,
diseases and therapy remains limited, underlining the urgency of fundamental studies and drug
development. Studies have shown that induction of autophagy and hijacking of autophagic machinery
are essential for infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2; however, the mechanism of this manipulation
and function of autophagy during SARS-CoV-2 infection remain unclear. In the present study, we
identified ORF3 as an inducer of autophagy and revealed that ORF3 localizes to the ER and induces
FAM134B-related ERphagy through the HMGB1-Beclin1 pathway. As a consequence, ORF3 induces ER
stress and inflammatory responses through ERphagy and sensitizes cells to ER stress-induced cell death,
suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3 hijacks ERphagy and then harms ER homeostasis to induce
inflammatory responses through excessive ER stress. These findings reveal a sequential induction of
ERphagy, ER stress and acute inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide
therapeutic potential for ERphagy and ER stress-related drugs for COVID-19 treatment and prevention.

Importance
SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication require autophagosome-like double-membrane vacuoles.
Inhibition of autophagy suppresses viral replication, indicating the essential role of autophagy in SARSCoV-2 infection. However, how SARS-CoV-2 hijacks autophagy and the function of autophagy in the
disease progression remain unknown. Here, we reveal that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3 induces ERphagy and
consequently induces ER stress to trigger acute inflammatory responses and enhance sensitivity to ER
stress-induced apoptosis. Our studies uncover ERphagy-induced inflammatory responses during SARSCoV-2 infection and provide a promising therapeutic approach for treating SARS-CoV-2 infection and
inflammatory responses in COVID-19 by manipulating autophagy and ER stress.

Introduction
The pandemic COVID-19 outbreak has infected more than fifty million people and killed more than one
million people worldwide, and the number of patients and deaths are still rapidly increasing. Effective
treatments and therapy are still far from satisfactory; the development of specific drugs, therapy and
vaccines is quite urgent. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative
agent of COVID-19. As an emerging severe coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 is highly homologous to two other
severe coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, which have caused two pandemic outbreaks in the
past twenty years1, 2. SARS-CoV-2 infection in high-risk populations, such as older persons and persons
with underlying diseases, often causes severe respiratory failure, sepsis and even multiple organ failure,
accompanied by severe acute inflammation and excessive cytokine release known as a “cytokine storm”
3-5.

To date, knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease remains very limited.

Autophagy is a conserved physiological process in eukaryotic cells that separates and wraps intracellular
waste, damaged organelles and invasive microorganisms into double-membrane vacuoles and
eventually degrades them through lysosomes

6, 7.

It is finely regulated through many core autophagy-

related genes and several upstream signal cascades that are primarily initiated from amino acid and
glucose deprivation, extracellular stimuli, intracellular damage and so on 6. Autophagy plays essential
roles in cell activities and behaviors, mainly maintaining intracellular homeostasis, removing intracellular
threats, repairing organelle damage and protecting cells from death

8, 9.

However, excessive autophagy

also hastens cell death 10, 11. While autophagy has exhibited great therapeutic potential in many diseases
12,

safe and effective approaches in clinical applications still require prolonged development.

Autophagy usually eliminates invading viral infection and promotes antiviral responses; however,
autophagy can also be hijacked by viruses to facilitate infection, replication and pathogenesis 13, 14. Many
enveloped viruses often enter, replicate, mature and transport through autophagy-related vesicles

15-17.

Thus, autophagy inhibition by genetic approaches or inhibitors effectively suppresses viral infection and
diseases

18, 19.

Therefore, autophagy has become a promising therapeutic target for viral infectious

diseases.
Coronaviruses differentially regulate autophagy through distinct mechanisms. For example, several viral
proteins of SARS-CoV-1 and MHV induce autophagy for viral infection and replication
MERS-CoV Nsp6 inhibits autophagy

22

20-23

, whereas

. However, autophagy inhibition by different drugs and inhibitors

effectively blocks their infection and replication, and coronaviruses likely require low levels of basic
autophagy for viral entry and incomplete autophagy for virion assembly and maturation.
Previous studies have shown that the autophagy inhibitors CQ and HCQ significantly suppress SARSCoV-2 infection and replication

24, 25,

leading to hopes that COVID-19 might be defeated by modulating

autophagy. However, ineffectiveness or no observed benefit of CQ and its derivatives has been confirmed
in clinical trials of COVID-19 therapies

26-28,

indicating that autophagy-related therapeutic strategies are

still far from clinical application. Importantly, the infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 requires
activation of autophagy, and autophagy-like double-membrane vesicles are employed for viral RNA

. Therefore, elucidating the fine regulation of autophagy by SARS-CoV-2

and its function during infection and replication is quite urgent for understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection
and pathogenesis and for developing autophagy-related therapies and drugs for COVID-19 treatment.
In the present study, we performed systemic screening and found that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3 induces
ERphagy through the HMGB1-Beclin1 axis, consequently activating ER stress and inflammatory
responses through ERphagy and sensitizing cells to ER stress-related cell death. Our findings reveal a
novel induction of autophagy, ER stress and inflammatory responses by SARS-CoV-2 and provide a
potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 treatment and drug development.

Results
A systemic screening identified that ORF3 induces autophagy
To investigate how SARS-CoV-2 regulates autophagy, systemic screening of a viral protein-expressing
library was performed using the Gaussia luciferase-based autophagy reporter actin-LC3-DN, which
detects the cleavage of pro-LC3, a key precursor of the autophagic protein LC3/ATG8 30. After two rounds
of screening, we identified several viral proteins that may decrease autophagy-dependent pro-LC3
cleavage; comparatively, ORF3 increases autophagy-dependent pro-LC3 cleavage in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure S1). To confirm that ORF3 serves as an inducer of autophagy, an ORF3-expressing
plasmid was transfected into cells without or followed by HBSS starvation. The shift of LC3-I to LC3-II
was obviously enhanced, while the p62 level was decreased by ORF3 expression; both were augmented
under HBSS starvation (Figure 1A). Furthermore, we detected the activation of one key kinase, Akt, which
negatively regulates autophagy, and found that Akt phosphorylation was greatly decreased by ORF3
expression, similar to HBSS starvation (Figure 1B). To further visualize the autophagosome in the
absence or presence of ORF3 expression, the ORF3-expressing plasmid was cotransfected with GFPLC3- or ptfLC3-expressing plasmid. Increased GFP-LC3 puncta were observed in the presence of ORF3
expression compared with empty vector transfection (Figure 1C), and the formation of LC3-positive
autophagosomes (yellow puncta) and the maturation of autolysosomes (red puncta) were similarly
enhanced by ORF3 expression (Figure 1D). Similarly, by electron microscopy, increased doublemembrane vacuoles of autophagy were observed in ORF3-expressing cells compared with few
autophagic vacuoles in empty vector-transfected cells (Figure 1E). These results suggest that ORF3
overexpression significantly induced autophagy.

ORF3 localizes to the ER and induces FAM134B-mediated ERphagy
To investigate the type of autophagy induced by ORF3, the subcellular location of ORF3 was
determined by immunofluorescence. We found that OFR3 colocalized with ER membrane protein
reticulon 3 (RTN3) around the nuclei (Figure 2A) and low colocalization levels with the autophagosome
marker LC3 was observed, suggesting that ORF3 localizes to the ER but not in autophagic vacuoles.
Alternatively, low colocalization levels of ORF3 with lysosomal red dye LysoTracker was observed (Figure
2B). Then, we presumed that ORF3 regulates ER-related autophagy, and the receptor of ERphagy
FAM134B was determined in the absence or presence of ORF3 overexpression. The expression of
FAM134B was not affected by ORF3 expression (Figure S2), while colocalization of ORF3 and FAM134B
was observed (Figure 2C). Interestingly, FAM134B puncta were induced in the presence of ORF3
expression compared with the few FAM134B puncta observed in cells in the absence of ORF3 expression
(Figure 2C). These results suggest that ORF3 promotes FAM134B-related ERphagy.

ORF3 interacts with HMGB1 and induces Beclin-1-dependent autophagy
To investigate how ORF3 induces autophagy, we investigated public SARS-CoV-2 viral protein-binding

protein network resources and found that several ORF3-binding proteins are involved in autophagy
regulation

31

. Five proteins were depleted by shRNA, and the effect on ORF3-induced autophagy was

carefully detected. Depletion of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1)
greatly suppressed the ability of ORF3 to induce autophagy, whereas VPS11 and VPS39 depletion only
weakly affected autophagy induction (Figure 3A and Figure S3A). As expected, the level of LC3-I-to-LC3II shift induced by ORF3 was greatly decreased by HMGB1 shRNA in a dose-dependent manner (Figure
3B), confirming that HMGB1 is required for ORF3-induced autophagy. Furthermore, the interaction
between ORF3 and HMGB1 was observed when both were transiently overexpressed in cells (Figure
3C). HMGB1 is associated with Beclin1 to enhance autophagy

32, 33

, and the increased interaction of

ORF3 with HMGB1 enhanced the association of Beclin1 with HMGB1 (Figure 3D), suggesting that ORF3
interacts with HMGB1 to enhance the HMGB1-Beclin1 association and subsequently induce autophagy.
In addition, ORF3 interacts with HMOX1, and depletion of HMOX1 moderately attenuates the LC3-I to
LC3-II shift in the presence of ORF3 expression (Figure S3B and S3C), indicating that HMOX1 may be
involved in ORF3 induction in autophagy. Given that HMOX1 contributes to oxidative stress and HMGB1
acts as a key regulator of autophagy under oxidative stress, HMOX1 and HMGB1 may cooperate in the
regulation of autophagy under oxidative stress in the presence of ORF3 expression.
To further detect the role of Beclin1 in ORF3 regulation in autophagy, wild-type or Beclin1-deficient cells
(Beclin1-KO) were transfected with ORF3-expressing plasmid, ORF3-induced increase of LC3-II/LC3-I
shift and decrease of p62 level was completely attenuated in Beclin1-KO cells compared with that in wildtype cells (Figure 3E). These results suggest that ORF3 induces Beclin1-dependent autophagy through
the HMGB1-Beclin1 pathway.

ORF3 induces ER stress and inflammatory responses through ERphagy
To further investigate the function of ORF3-induced autophagy, the transcriptome of ORF3-expressing
A549 cells was analyzed by RNA-sequencing analysis. The differentially expressed gene (DEG) clusters
were enriched by GSEA analysis. ORF3-induced enriched DEGs shared high similarity to the DEGs in
SARS-COV-2- and MERS-CoV-infected cells (Figure S4A). Interestingly, ER stress-related genes (Figure
4A, top) and innate immune and inflammatory genes (Figure 4A, middle and bottom) were enriched in
the presence of ORF3 expression, indicating that ORF3 activates both ER stress and inflammatory
responses. Alternatively, 97 DEGs were upregulated in both SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and ORF3expressing cells (Figure S4B), and a cluster of genes involved in ER stress and immune and inflammatory
responses were highly upregulated by both ORF3 expression and SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure S4C),
suggesting that ORF3 plays a critical role in the induction of ER stress and inflammatory responses during
SARS-CoV-2 infection.
To confirm that ER stress was induced by ORF3 expression, ER stress-related gene expression was
detected in ORF3-expressing cells. The expression of BIP/Grp78 and CHOP gradually increased
following increasing ORF3 expression, and the phosphorylation of eIF2α was similarly increased by

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.17.387902; this version posted November 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this

ORF3 expression (Figure 4B). Notably, the induction of ER stress by ORF3 expression requires
autophagy, and the increased BIP/Grp78 and CHOP expression and eIF2α phosphorylation were
completely abolished in Beclin1-KO cells compared to wild-type cells (Figure 4C). However, depletion of
the ER stress-related gene CHOP barely affected autophagy induction by ORF3 expression (Figure 4D),
indicating that ORF3 induces autophagy independent of ER stress. These results suggest that ORF3
induces ER stress through autophagy induction, probably because ORF3-induced excessive ERphagy
reprograms or disrupts ER homeostasis.
ER dysfunction often triggers innate immune and inflammatory responses; thus, the expression of key
cytokines and the proinflammatory factors IFNβ, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα were induced by ORF3 expression.
The induction of these factors was dependent on autophagy because Beclin1 deficiency in Beclin1-KO
cells abolished the increased expression of these cytokines compared with that in wild-type cells (Figure
4E). Similarly, depletion of CHOP expression also greatly attenuated their increased expression in the
presence of ORF3 expression (Figure 4F). These results suggest that ORF3 induces ER stress and
subsequent inflammatory responses through ERphagy.

ORF3-induced ERphagy and ER stress sensitize cells to ER apoptotic cell death
Considering that ORF3 induces ER stress, we presumed that ORF3 disrupts ER function and promotes
cell death under ER dysfunction. ORF3-expressing A549 cells were treated with tunicamycin, an inducer
of ER stress that causes an unfolded protein response and induces ER stress by inhibiting the N-linked
glycosylation of GlcNAc phosphotransferase. Under tunicamycin treatment, the phosphorylation of the
stress-related kinases p38-MAPK and SAPK/JNK was increased in the presence of ORF3 expression as
well as c-Jun phosphorylation (Figure 5A, top). Importantly, the cleavage of ER-specific caspase-12 was
increased by ORF3 expression under tunicamycin treatment (Figure 5A, bottom). These results suggest
that ORF3 enhances ER apoptotic cell death under ER stress.
To confirm that the increased cell death is responsible for ERphagy and ER stress, ER apoptotic cell
death was further investigated under deficiency of autophagy or ER stress in Beclin1-KO or CHOP
depleted cells, respectively. ORF3-induced phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK and cleavage of caspase-12
were greatly eliminated when ERphagy was blocked in Beclin1-KO cells (Figure 5B), indicating that
ERphagy was required for ORF3-induced ER-related apoptosis. Similarly, the blockade of ER stress by
CHOP depletion also eliminated ER-related apoptosis in ORF3-expressing cells (Figure 5C). Altogether,
our results suggest that ORF3 overexpression triggers ER stress and ER abnormalities through ERphagy
and consequently enhances the sensitivity of apoptosis to ER stress-related drugs.

Discussion
Studies have confirmed that autophagy plays essential roles in the infection and replication of
coronaviruses 34, 35; inhibition by genetic approaches and chemical inhibitors effectively suppresses their
infection and might offer a promising therapeutic strategy for treating these infectious diseases. As an
emerging severe coronavirus, the modulation and function of autophagy in SARS-CoV-2 infection and
diseases remain unclear. By systemic screening, we revealed that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3 localizes to the
ER compartment and induces FAM134B-mediated ERphagy through the HMGB1-Beclin1 pathway,
subsequently contributing to ER stress and activating proinflammatory responses through ERphagy and
ER functional reprogramming (Figure 6). As a consequence, sensitivity to ER stress-related drugs and
ER apoptotic cell death are greatly enhanced in ORF3-expressing cells. This improves the therapeutic
potential of autophagy- and ER stress-related drugs in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and
COVID-19 disease for suppressing severe inflammatory responses and inducing cell death in SARSCoV-2-infected cells.

The autophagy inhibitor chloroquine and its derivative suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication
24, 25,

raising important hopes in therapeutic COVID-19 treatment and prevention. Although poor

effectiveness and benefit have been concluded in clinical trials

26, 27,

autophagy is confirmed to play

essential roles in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. First, coronaviruses enter cells through endocytosis

36

and

egress through lysosomes37, which require a fine control of autophagy and lysosomal degradation.
Second, a recent study showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication require autophagosome-like
double-membrane vacuoles for RNA export and replication

29,

indicating the essential requirement of

autophagy and autophagic machinery for viral replication and assembly. Finally, the maturation and
transport of virions of SARS-CoV-2 might also require autophagy or autophagic vacuoles like other RNA
viruses

16.

However, excessive autophagy is not beneficial to either cells or viruses because killing

infected cells or clearing intracellular viral infection by strong autophagy induction is an effective antiviral
defense. Therefore, autophagic processes are finely regulated to limit the appropriate strength and
duration for facilitating cell survival and viral replication. Inhibitory viral proteins or other products of
autophagy must exist during SARS-CoV-2 infection, as indicated in our preliminary screening; i.e., several
viral proteins can suppress autophagy (Figure S1). In fact, several viral proteins of coronaviruses induce
incomplete autophagy, and replication of coronaviruses utilizes the autophagic machinery while not
requiring the complete genes and pathways of autophagy 23, 38. Thus, more viral regulation of autophagy
and its function in SARS-CoV-2 infection require further investigation.

Our findings reveal that ORF3-induced ERphagy reprograms ER homeostasis and activates ER stress,
probably to tolerate and adapt to the accumulation of viral proteins and recover ER function under virusinduced stresses. Many viral proteins of coronavirus rush to the ER

39

and form double-membrane

vacuoles from the ER for viral replication 16, 29. We confirmed that ORF3 localizes to the ER and induces

FAM134B-mediated ERphagy. Consequently, ORF3 induces ER stress through Beclin1-dependent
autophagy, and Beclin1 deficiency abolishes the activation of ER stress in the presence of ORF3
expression, representing a novel induction of adaptive ER stress through ERphagy during SARS-CoV-2
infection. Therefore, ERphagy and ER stress are activated by SARS-CoV-2 through ORF3 to restrict the
appropriate overload of viral proteins in the ER membrane and lumen, recycle overloaded viral proteins
or repair ER damage.

As a consequence, ERphagy and ER stress induced by ORF3 reprogram ER function and activate
inflammatory responses. Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection in diverse cells induces ER
stress and activates proinflammatory responses 40, 41. Our studies confirmed that inflammatory responses
are mainly induced by ORF3 through ERphagy-mediated ER stress, and blockade of ERphagy by Beclin1
KO or ER stress by CHOP depletion greatly eliminates the induction of key cytokines and inflammatory
factors. This provides evidence that ERphagy and ER stress are the key upstream modulators of
inflammatory responses during SARV-CoV-2 infection and may act as first-line precipitating factors of
cytokine storms in COVID-19 patients, offering a novel target and approach to alleviating acute
inflammatory responses during early SARS-CoV-2 infection through suppression of autophagy and ER
stress.

Finally, considering that ER stress is activated and ER function is reprogrammed by ORF3 expression,
we presumed that ORF3 may enhance the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells to ER stress-related
drugs. Indeed, ORF3-expressing cells are sensitive to ER stress-drug tunicamycin treatment. The stressrelated kinases p38-MAPK and SAPK/JNK were activated and ER apoptotic caspase-12 cleavage was
enhanced by ORF3 in the presence of tunicamycin treatment. Correspondingly, they were abolished in
Beclin1-deficient cells or CHOP-depleted cells separately, indicating that ORF3 enhances ER apoptotic
cell death through excessive ERphagy and ER stress. These findings also support the therapeutic
potential of ERphagy and ER stress in COVID-19 treatment, consistent with a hypothesis that ER stress
is increased in COVID-19 patients and may benefit treatment 42-44.

In summary, our studies identified a novel viral inducer of autophagy during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We
found that ORF3 localizes to the ER and triggers ERphagy through the HMGB1-Beclin1 pathway,
consequently inducing ER stress and inflammatory responses. Our findings revealed a sequential
induction of ERphagy, ER stress and inflammatory responses by SARS-CoV-2 ORF3 expression,
facilitate insight into the hijacking of autophagy, reprogramming of ER function and activation of acute
inflammatory responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis, and offer a novel therapeutic
target for COVID-19 treatment by suppressing autophagy and modulating ER stress.

Real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed using HiScript® III
RT SuperMix (Vazyme). Real-time PCR was performed with a SYBR Green I Master Mix kit (Roche) and
LightCycler® 480 system. The primer pairs are listed in supplementary Table S1.

Immunofluorescence staining
The cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min,
permeabilized with methanol for 10 min, and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min.
Then, the cells were incubated with primary antibody overnight. After three washes with PBS containing
0.1% Triton X-100, the cells were incubated with Alexa 488- or 555-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibodies
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 1 h. The cells were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO) followed by three additional washes. The cells were mounted in antifade agent
on glass slides and visualized with a confocal fluorescence microscope (Zeiss LSM800 microscopy with
a 64× NA oil-immersion objective).
Luciferase assays
A Gaussia luciferase-based reporter to detect pre-LC3 cleavage was used for the detection of
autophagy activation30. Briefly, the Actin-LC3-DN reporter was transfected into HEK293T cells with either
empty vector or Flag-ORF3-expressing plasmid in a 96-well plate. Twenty-four hours later, the cell
supernatants were collected, and the secretion of Gaussia luciferase was measured using the reagent
for the measurement of Renilla luciferase activity in a TriStar multimode reader. For each analysis, three
independent experiments were performed in triplicate, and the mean ± SD was calculated.

Electron microscopy
Flag-ORF3-expressing or control HEK293T cells were scraped, resuspended in DMEM and centrifuged
in 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes. The medium was removed, and the cell pellets were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde
overnight at 4°C. The pellets were gently collected and placed in a specimen bottle containing 3%
glutaraldehyde for fixation for another 24 h. After the fixed solution was discarded, the cells were rinsed
with 0.1 M phosphate buffer for 1 h, washed 3-4 times, and fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h. This
was followed by another 3×10 min washes in 0.1 M phosphate buffer for 1 h. After dehydration through a
series of ethanol washes from 30% to 2 washes in 100%, the cells were incubated in a mixture of Epon
and propylene oxide (3:1 in v/v) for 90 min, embedded in a mold of 100% plastic, placed in a 70℃ oven
and allowed to harden overnight (Epon 812). The cells were cut using a diamond knife to obtain ultrathin
slices; the slices were placed on a hexadecimal copper grid (Electron Microscopy Science, H200-Cu).

RNA sequencing analysis and data availability
A549 cells were transfected with Flag-ORF3 or empty vector for 36 h, and total RNA was extracted
with TRIzol following manufacturer procedures. Approximately 5 μg of total RNA was subjected to deep
RNA sequencing. Libraries were constructed and sequenced on an Illumina platform, and 150 bp pairedend reads were generated. Data analysis was performed with Molecule Annotation System 3.0 (Annoroad
Gene Technology Co., Beijing, China). The raw sequencing datasets generated in this study are available
on the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) server under the accession number GSE158484. The
RNA-sequencing data of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells were downloaded under the accession number
GSE147507 from previously published analysis45.

GSEA analysis
Gene

set enrichment analysis was

performed

using

GSEA software (https://www.gsea-

msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp) with number of permutations = 1000, permutation type = gene_set,
enrichment statistic = weighted and metric for ranking genes = Signal2Noise. Enrichment outputs were
considered significant and selected when NES ≥ 1, p < 0.05 and FDR < 0.25.

Figure 6. Diagram of ORF3-induced ERphagy, ER stress and inflammatory responses
During SARS-CoV-2 infection, ORF3 interacts with HMGB1 and enhances the association between
HMGB1 and Beclin1 to initiate FAM134B-mediated ERphagy. Consequently, ER stress is induced by
ORF3 through ERphagy to trigger proinflammatory responses and enhance the sensitivity of cells to
caspase-12-mediated ER apoptotic cell death.
