Abstract

22

SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in the human breast milk of infected mothers, raising

23

concerns regarding the safety of breastfeeding upon infection. We here show that holder

24

pasteurization inactivates SARS-CoV-2 and provides an alternative and safe option for

25

infected mothers to continue feeding breast milk to their infants.

Introduction

27

The current coronavirus pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome

28

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), raises unprecedented questions regarding virus transmission

29

and risks for pregnant or breastfeeding women. We and others recently described that SARS-

30

CoV-2 is detectable in breast milk of infected mothers

31

multiple breast milk samples of mothers suffering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-

32

19). In two cases where the mother continued breastfeeding, the newborns were also tested

33

positive for SARS-CoV-2 and one infant developed severe respiratory disease

34

the origin of the infections of the newborns remained unclear and raises concerns of possible

35

virus transmission via breast milk.

36

The safety and feasibility of breastfeeding is of high importance as breast milk contains

37

nutrients, hormones, and immunoprotective entities that are essential for the development,

38

health, and protection of the neonate from infections 6. So far, the World Health Organization

39

(WHO) recommends to continue breastfeeding upon SARS-CoV-2 infection of the mother

40

while taking measures of strict hygiene and wearing masks to protect the child from droplets

41

or aerosols 7. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that the decision

42

for breastfeeding lays with the mother, family and health care providers 8. Generally, stopping

43

breastfeeding is not advised, however, given the recent detection of SARS-CoV-2 in breast

44

milk samples, a possible transmission of the virus via breastfeeding cannot be ruled out.

45

Therefore, measures to provide safety of infants are urgently required. Thus, we here explored

46

the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in human milk by holder pasteurization (heating to 63°C for

47

30 minutes) to reduce the risk of a possible virus transmission while preserving many of

48

milk’s beneficial properties.

Results

51

To test if SARS-CoV-2 retains infectivity in human breast milk and to explore holder

52

pasteurization as a possible inactivation method, we spiked five different SARS-CoV-2

53

isolates from Germany, France and the Netherlands into five individual breast milk samples,

54

and incubated them for 30 minutes at room temperature or 63°C. Samples where then titrated

55

Netherlands/01) remained infectious in the milk samples that were incubated for 30 minutes at

58

room temperature, with infectious titers of 0.09 to 1.2 × 105 TCID50/mL (Figure 1A, B). Of

59

note, in each milk sample, we detected a 40.9 – 92.8% decrease of viral titers compared to the

60

medium control. This was independent of the viral strain, suggesting that this partial

61

inactivation of virus is an intrinsic property of human milk, as previously described for many

62

enveloped viruses including hepatitis C and Zika virus

63

no residual infectivity was detected in any of the samples (Figure 1A, B). Thus, human breast

milk containing infectious SARS-CoV-2 can be efficiently inactivated using standard holder

Discussion

68

Breastfeeding provides many health benefits and is therefore recommended as the optimal

69

feeding option for infants. Currently, the WHO recommends that SARS-CoV-2 infected

70

mothers continue breastfeeding while taking measures of strict hygiene to protect the child

71

from droplets or aerosols 7. As initial reports failed to detect the presence of viral RNA in

72

milk samples of infected mothers 12,13, the risk of transmission via breastfeeding was deemed

73

to be very low. Recent reports, however, demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected

74

in breast milk samples after virus infection, associated with at least one newborn with severe

75

respiratory disease

1–5

. These findings raise the concern of safety during breastfeeding and a

76

possible alternative or additional way of virus transmission to the infant. Holder

77

pasteurization (heating to 63°C for 30 minutes) has been used for a long time to inactivate

78

viral and bacterial agents, while at the same time preserving the many beneficial and

79

protective effects of human breast milk 6. Here, we evaluated holder pasteurization as an easy

80

and inexpensive methods to inactivate infectious SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk. Our data show

81

that independent of the tested SARS-CoV-2 isolates or the breast milk sample, viral

82

infectivity is completely eliminated by this treatment. Thus, holder pasteurization provides

83

safety for the infant and reassurance for the mother, who might consider discontinuing

84

breastfeeding and substituting for infant formula milk that lacks many of the human milk’s

85

important components. In conclusion, we here provide a safe and feasible option, when in

86

doubt, to continue feeding of the infant with breast milk upon symptomatic SARS-CoV-2

87

infection of the mother.

Methods

90

Cell culture. Vero E6 (Cercopithecus aethiops derived epithelial kidney) cells were grown in

91

Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco) which was supplemented with 2.5%

92

heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, 2

93

mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 1x non-essential amino acids (DMEM

94

complete). Caco-2 (human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma) cells were grown in DMEM

95

complete but with supplementation of 10% FCS. All cells were grown at 37°C in a 5% CO2

96

humidified incubator.

97

Virus strains and virus propagation. Viral isolate BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020 and

98

BetaCoV/Netherlands/01 were obtained through the European Virus Archive global. The viral

99

isolates BetaCoV/Germany/Ulm/01/2020, BetaCoV/Germany/Ulm/02/2020 and UKEssen

100

were obtained from patient samples. Virus was propagated by inoculation of 70% confluent

101

Vero E6 cells in 75 cm² cell culture flasks with 100 µl SARS-CoV-2 isolates in 3.5 ml serum-

102

free medium containing 1 µg/mL trypsin. Cells were incubated for 2 h at 37°C, before adding

103

20 ml medium containing 15 mM HEPES. Supernatant was harvested at day 3 post

104

inoculation when a strong cytopathic effect (CPE) was visible. Supernatants were centrifuged

105

for 5 min at 1,000 × g to remove cellular debris, and then aliquoted and stored at -80°C as

106

virus stocks. Infectious virus titer was determined as plaque forming units or TCID50/mL.

107

Milk samples. Milk samples were obtained from five healthy human donors after ethical

108

approval by the ethics commission of Hanover Medical School, Hanover, Germany and the

109

ethics committee of Ulm University. All mothers provided written informed consent for the

110

collection of samples and subsequent analysis. Milk was collected freshly and stored at -80°C

111

until further use as anonymized samples.

112

TCID50 endpoint titration. To determine the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50),

113

virus stocks or samples were serially diluted and used to inoculate Vero E6 or Caco-2 cells.

114

To this end, 20,000 cells were seeded per well in 96 flat bottom well plates and incubated

115

over night. Cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 in serial dilutions and incubated for 3-6

116

days and monitored for CPE. TCID50/mL was calculated according to Spearman-Karber.
