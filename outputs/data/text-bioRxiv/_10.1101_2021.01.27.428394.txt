Abstract
SARS-COV-2 has become a leading cause of illness, hospitalizations, and deaths worldwide yet
heterogeneity in disease morbidity remains a conundrum. In this study, we analyzed publicly
available single-cell RNA-seq data from 75076 cells sequenced from clinically staged COVID-19
patients using a network approach and identified lysosomal-immune axis as a factor
significantly associated with disease severity. Our results suggest modulation of lysosomalimmune pathways may present a novel drug-targeting strategy to attenuate SARS-Cov-2
infections.

Main Text
Since the first cases of COVID-19 were identified in late 2019, infections have spread worldwide
leading to over 100 million documented cases and more than 2.15 million deaths as of January
2020 [1]. Persistent long-term symptoms, and irreversible damage to vital organs have been
increasingly reported among patients with critical as well as seemingly less severe illness [2, 3].
While several vaccines are now available, some experts have suggested that longer-term
endemic levels of infection may persist, with intermittent waves of resurgence when circulating
strains acquire new pathogenic mutations evading vaccine-stimulated immunity [4]. An effective
COVID-19 response will therefore likely require not only widespread vaccine distribution, but also

a more complete picture of SARS-Cov-2 pathogenic mechanisms in order to proactively develop
and advance new treatments to address current and future challenges in terms of therapy.
Recently, single-cell RNA-seq data obtained from clinically staged COVID-19 patients was
published [5]. Whereas previous analyses of this data set have focused on identification and
characterization of immune cell types [5-8], we took advantage of this data to further profile
COVID-19 responses and identify pathway activities associated with moderate versus severe
clinical phenotypes. Data used for this analysis were single-cell RNAseq data obtained from cells
in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from Healthy Controls (HC; n = 3 patients; 20991
cells) and from COVID-19 patients clinically staged as either Moderate (M; n = 3 patients; 8084
cells) or Severe (S; n = 6 patients; 46001 cells) [5]. Using R packages Seurat [9] and WGCNA [10],
we performed transcriptomic profiling to identify broad cell types involved in infection response
and identified gene co-expression network disease- and severity-associated modules by WGCNA
(Fig.1A). Interestingly, we found that lysosomal-immune axis signaling is significantly associated
with COVID-19 severity. We also identified a protein interactome for cytokine signaling
associated with severe COVID-19 cases. Our results suggest distinctive transcriptomic profiles for
moderate versus severe COVID-19 and that the lysosomal-immune system pathways in COVID19 pathogenesis may offer novel drug targets.
The analysis workflow is shown in Fig. 1A. Broad cell type annotation identified numerous
macrophages along with other immune cell types in all samples, with disease severity-associated
macrophage populations in Severe samples (Fig. 1A). WGCNA applied to the gene-gene coexpression matrix generated from the normalized cell-gene arrays from the integrated Seurat
object identified 17 discrete co-expression modules across integrated sample cells (Fig. 1A).
Pearson correlation between module eigenvectors and dummy-encoded disease severity was
then calculated to examine whether any of these modules might be significantly correlated with
disease severity. Two of the identified modules were strongly and significantly positively
correlated with Severe disease; these were the Green and Pink modules (correlation coefficient
= 0.63, p = 0.00e+00 and correlation coefficient = 0.55, p = 0.00e+00, respectively). A separate
Brown module identified by this analysis was significantly positively correlated with Healthy

Control status (correlation coefficient = 0.71, p = 0.00e+00) and strongly negatively correlated
with Severe disease status (correlation coefficient = -0.72, p = 0.00e+00).
Positive module correlation indicates that module genes are co-expressed more actively among
cells from a particular clinical group, while negative correlation suggests suppression of the
module co-expression patterns. We then hypothesized that module co-expression patterns
might relate to infection response mechanisms contributing to variable clinical phenotypes. To
profile module functional biology, we generated protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks for
module genes and performed pathway enrichment analyses for the Brown, Green, and Pink
module PPI networks (Fig. 1B). PPI networks were generated for each module using the
NetworkAnalyst tool [11] and pathway enrichments were queried using Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis (IPA) [12] and Enrichr [13]. A number of immune system-lysosomal pathway
intersections were found to be prominently associated with these COVID-19 severity-linked
modules.
The Brown module, comprised of genes whose co-expression pattern is positively associated with
healthy control status, is enriched for antigen presentation, phagosome formation, and
cholesterol metabolism functions (Fig. 1B), with gene ontology cellular-component analysis
further revealing enrichment for genes whose expression is linked with early endosomal,
phagosomal and lysosomal compartments (Fig. 1B and Extended Fig. 1). Downregulated coexpression of Brown module genes in cells from severe COVID-19 patients has immune response
implications. Endo-/lysosome function is necessary for antigen processing and binding to major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II complex, and it is notable that the Brown module is
also found to be enriched for MHC II antigen processing and presentation functions (Fig. 1B,
Extended Fig. 1 3).
PPI network analysis for the Brown module identifies hub genes which provide further insights
into the immune-lysosomal axis activity of this module (Fig. 1B). The PPI network hub protein Cell
Division Control protein 42 (CDC42) is known to not only play a role in endo-/lysosomal pathway
regulation but has also been shown to be used by RNA viruses for entry into the cell [14].
Inactivation of Cdc42 is necessary for depolymerization of the phagosomal cytoskeleton,

subsequent phagosome maturation [14-17], and antigen acquisition and processing [18].
Another hub gene for brown module, Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma
(PPARG) is a regulator of cholesterol metabolism in alveolar immune cells [19] and has been
shown to regulate MHC II gene expression [20, 21]. MHC II machinery is integral for antigen
presentation and is required for immunity against RNA viruses [22]. Downregulation of MHC class
II machinery genes transcription is a common strategy exploited by viruses to deceive, hide from,
and bypass host immune responses [23]; this same strategy is also exploited by SARS-COV2 [24].
The downregulation of Brown module genes in severe COVID-19 patients confirms via clinical
evidence that these pathways are mechanisms by which SARS-Cov2 evades immune system
control, as we find this downregulation to be significantly associated with severe COVID-19.
In contrast to suppression of Brown module linked pathways, the Green and Pink modules
identified by WGCNA are strongly and significantly correlated with severe disease state (Fig. 1A),
indicating upregulation of pathways linked with these modules among critically ill patients. The
Green module eigengene has correlation 0.63 with Severe disease state (p = 0.00e+00), but
negligible correlation with Moderate disease state (correlation = 0.051). Genes in the PPI network
associated with the Green module are enriched for pathways involved in aberrant cytokine
responses and hypercytokinemia, the so-called “cytokine storm.” These findings suggest that the
Green module and its PPI network identify pathways uniquely activated in the severe disease.
Abnormal cytokine release has been implicated as a main source of lung damage in severely ill
COVID-19 patients [25, 26]. The PPI network for the Green module shows STAT3, STAT1, JUN and
FOS as hubs (Fig. 1B). Aberrant STAT pathway activity has been shown to be central in the
pathogenesis of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and STAT3 is central to cytokine
storm response in COVID-19 [27]. As an additional note, STAT3 also has been shown to associate
with vacuolar H+-ATPase to regulate cytosolic and lysosomal pH [28], an activity which might
further be exploited by SARS-COV-2 to deacidify the lysosome for egress of multiplying virus from
the cell.
Alongside the Green module, the Pink module was also found to be positively correlated with
disease severity. Genes in the Pink module are highly enriched for chemokine signaling, IL17
signaling, and lysosomal compartment (Fig. 1B, Extended Fig 1). Pink module PPI network analysis

reveals hub genes for the module (Fig. 1B). Macrophages from the severe patients showed the
greatest upregulation of Pink module genes. One of the hub gene, Cyclin Dependent Kinase
Inhibitor 1A (CDKI1A, p21, CIP1) is a known cell cycle and apoptosis regulator. CDKI1A can be
exploited by RNA viruses in macrophages to inhibit their apoptosis and turn them into reservoir
for their unchecked replication without detection from host immune system [29]. CDKI1A is a key
player in macrophage activation and reprogramming crucial for proper host response against
viruses [30]. The enrichment of the module genes for chemokine signaling and lysosomal
compartment suggests an intricate crosstalk between the two systems that has been shown to
regulate the magnitude and duration of the chemokine response that is central to the ARDS or
the cytokine [31, 32].
From the heatmap shown in Fig. 2B, we can see that Brown module gene expression is highest
among macrophage cells in healthy controls. Green module expression is increased in severe case
macrophage and neutrophil cells. Pink module gene expression is most increased among severe
case macrophage cells. These module expression patterns corroborate earlier findings showing
that alveolar macrophage may be the main driver of ‘cytokine storm’ in the severe patients [25,
26] and the observation suggests that macrophage specific drugs targets could be crucial for an
effective therapy for COVID19.
Ghosh et al. [33] previously have shown using mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) that β-coronaviruses
do not use biosynthetic secretory pathways for egress as do other enveloped viruses. Rather, βcoronaviruses hijack lysosomal machinery for this purpose: deacidifying these vessels to
inactivate proteolytic enzymes and repurposing them as a novel egress passage with the help of
Arf-like small GTPase Arl8b, Hspa5, and Rab7 proteins. Notably, greater expression of each of
these genes ARL8B (Green Module PPI), HSPA5 (Brown Module PPI) and RAB7A (Brown Module
PPI) was found to be significantly associated with disease stage among the COVID-19 cells, as can
be seen by mosaic plots with chi-square test p-values in Fig. 2A. The intricate communication
between endo/lysosomal and immune system is critical for proper antigen presentation and an
efficient and optimum host immune response [34, 35]. MHC Class II presentation has been shown
to be controlled by the lysosomal ARL8B [36] and ARL8B is likely also to be used by SARS-COV-2
for egress via lysosome, deceiving the host immune system [33].

An additional finding in the Brown module is enrichment for cholesterol metabolism pathways,
which is consistent with growing evidence for participation of cholesterol in immune response
pathways. Late Endosomal/Lysosomal cholesterol accumulation has been shown to be a
protective mechanism among host cells for inhibiting the endosomal escape of viruses [37].
Cholesterol content is also crucial for proper antigen presentation via MHC II machinery [38]. Our
findings, downregulation of several cholesterol metabolism genes in brown module in the severe
patients, aligning with the findings from CRISPR screen from Daniloski et al. [39], indicate that
SARS-COV2 may be benefited by the downregulated cholesterol levels in the endo/lysosomal
compartment leading to an undetected and unchecked escape from the compartment evading
the protective mechanism. Corroborating with the existence of mechanisms for down-regulated
cholesterol in viral infection response, we found in our analysis that cholesterol metabolism
genes contained in the Brown module are most heavily down-regulated in severe COVID-19
patients (Fig. 2C). Cholesterol regulation is crucial for proper antigen presentation via MHC II
machinery [38], and these observed expression differences invite questions about whether and
how manipulating cholesterol levels in the endo-/lysosomal compartment might offer new
therapeutic strategies against COVID-19.
CRISPR screens performed by Daniloski et al. [39] to identify genes required as host factors for
SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells provide further insight into SARS-Cov-2 exploitation of the
endo/lysosomal compartment. Comparison of results from our analysis with genes identified in
these CRISPR screens further validates the centrality of the immune-lysosomal axis as a
significant factor in COVID-19 pathogenesis. In particular, the identified CRISPR screen- genes
were found to significantly overlap with the Brown module (p = 7.681e-04) (Fig. 2D). A majority
of the genes identified in these CRISPR experiments, including RAB7A, are localized to the endo/lysosomal compartment. Together, the results provide further support for endo/lysosomal
compartment biology as a potential key element in the SARS-CoV-2 viral life circle.
Although the lysosome typically functions as a command-and-control center in the host immune
response against viruses [40], growing evidence suggests that SARS‐CoV‐2 hijacks this
compartment for replication, making it possible for the virus to not only evade but impair initial
host immune responses [33]. Yet SARS-COV-2 also requires intact lysosomal function for its life

cycle [16, 33, 40], revealing potential vulnerability along the crucial lysosomal-immune axis, as
well. Our findings provide new support and clinical validation for these observations, and we
identify new gene co-expression and PPI networks which may mediate disease severity. These
findings have implications for the new drug development and existing drug repurposing against
COVID19.

Sample Integration, Clustering, and Broad Cell Types Integration in Seurat
For quality control, cells with nFeature between 200 - 6500 and mitochondrial genes percent less
than 10% were retained. Each gene-cell expression matrix was first normalized using
‘NormalizeData’ methods in Seurat v3 with default parameters, then ‘vst’ as the selection
method for the FindVariableFeatures function was applied to identify the top 2000 variable
genes. Samples were split by disease severity and integrated using the FindIntergrationAnchors
function using standard Seurat workflows and 1000 anchors for canonical correlation analysis
(CCA)-based integration. Cells were clustered with FindClusters function with 10 principal
components and 0.6 resolution.
Weighted Gene Co-expression Analysis (WGCNA)
WGCNA was performed in R using the ‘WGCNA’ package (v1.69) [10]. A gene-gene co-expression
matrix was first generated from the normalized cell-gene arrays extracted from the Seurat data
object containing all samples. Following WGCNA protocol, a scale free-topology fit index was
plotted as a function of potential values for the soft thresholding power, and a soft threshold
power of 6 was selected empirically for transformation of the co-expression similarity matrix into
a topological overlap matrix (TOM). The TOM matrix reflects relationships of topological
similarity between genes. The dissimilarity matrix (1 – TOM) is used to represent dissimilarity.
This dissimilarity matrix is then used to cluster groups of genes into co-expression modules.

Statistics and Reproducibility
Data used in this study is publicly available. Statistical methods are presented here in the context
of their use and interpretation
Hypergeometric Test for Set Overlap Enrichment
Statistical comparison of module overlaps was performed in R using the Hypergeometric test
function phyper().
Pearson’s Chi-Square Test
For each gene, we defined three expression levels based on median (MD) and median absolute
deviation (MAD). Normal level of a gene expressed in a cell is (0, MD+MAD); high level is
[MD+MAD, MD+2*MAD); Very high level is (MD+2*MAD, INF). Therefore, a contingence table
was able to be established for a gene with two categorical variables (Severity, Expression Level)
and three factor levels each (Health Control, Moderate, Severe; Normal, High, Very High). In this
case, we can determine whether Severity and Expression Level are independent for a specific
gene by applying function chisq.test() in R. To better visualize a contingence table, Pearson
residuals, and test result P-value, mosaic() in R package ‘vcd’ was used to make plots Figure 2A.

(WGCNA). Schematic of the workflow showing single cell data from Healthy Control
(HC), Moderate (M), and Severe (COVID-19) cases used for broad cell types clustering and
WGCNA to identify modules significantly correlated with disease severity. Also, note the change
in clustering and separation of macrophage portion in Severe cases. (A). PPI networks and
pathway functional enrichments for genes in highly correlated modules are shown for Brown,
Green, and Pink modules (B).
Fig. 2 | COVID-19 Severity-Associated Genes. Chi-squared testing of independence shows
significant associations between COVID-19 severity and expression of ARL8B, RAB7A, and HSPA5
(A). Module gene expression heatmaps for Brown, Green, and Pink modules confirm differential
expression by clinical stage and cell type (B). Dotplot shows expression of cholesterol metabolism
genes from Brown module (C). Brown module PPI network is significantly enriched for genes
implicated in COVID-19 pathogenesis (D).
