Abstract:
Introduction:
The ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) has affected millions of people worldwide and with notable heterogeneity in its clinical
presentation. Probability of contracting this highly contagious infection is similar across age
groups but disease severity and fatality among aged patients with or without comorbidities are
higher. We hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 infection may augment aging-related gene
expression alterations resulting in severe outcomes in elderly patients.
Methodology:
We performed a comparative analysis of publicly available transcriptome data from Broncho
Alveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF)/lung/blood of healthy aging group with i) COVID-19 patients;
and ii) data of host genes interacting with SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
Results:
We observed i) a significant overlap of gene expression profiles of patients’ BALF and blood
with lung and blood of the healthy group respectively; ii) a more pronounced overlap in blood
compared to lung; and iii) a similar overlap between host genes interacting with SARS-CoV-2
and aging blood transcriptome.
Conclusions:
Pathway enrichment analysis of overlapping gene sets suggests that infection alters expression
of genes already dysregulated in the elderly, which together may lead to poor prognosis. eQTLs
in these genes may also confer poor outcome in young patients worsening with age and comorbidities. Furthermore, the pronounced overlap observed in blood may explain clinical
symptoms including blood clots, strokes, heart attack, multi-organ failure etc. in severe cases.
This model based on a limited patient dataset seems robust and holds promise for testing larger
tissue specific datasets from patients with varied severity and across populations.
Introduction:
In December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel
coronavirus was first reported as a zoonotic pathogen, that causes COVID-19 in humans and
is capable of human-to-human transmission1. Since then it has spread rapidly across the world
and thus has been classified as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization2. As of
June 10, 2020, there have been 7.04 million confirmed COVID-19 cases with 404000 deaths
reported worldwide (https://ourworldindata.org) with continuing trend of sharp rise in both
these categories in many countries/regions. The disease is highly heterogenous in its clinical
presentation with the respiratory system being most commonly attacked and showing
symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and fatigue. In addition, myalgia,
neurological symptoms (headache, dizziness, and altered consciousness), ischaemic and
haemorrhagic strokes, muscle injury and gastrointestinal symptoms without respiratory
symptoms or fever are also reported in a subset of patients3. Furthermore, in COVID-19
patients other clinical complications such as hypercoagulable state with increased risk of
venous thromboembolism4 and in some cases, a 'cytokine storm' comprised of tumor necrosis
factor α (TNF-α), interleukins (IL) 6, 1β, 8,12, interferon-gamma inducible protein (IP10),
macrophage inflammatory protein 1A (MIP1A), and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1
(MCP1)5 has been observed. Several clinical trials are ongoing but as of date, no drugs or other
therapeutics have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prevent
or treat COVID-196 and thus, treatment being provided is only empirical. On the other hand,
clinical management includes infection prevention with control measures and supportive care
including supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilatory support when indicated6. Efforts to

combat COVID-19 are severely hampered by grossly inadequate knowledge of several
important aspects of the illness ranging from pathogen biology to host response, disease
biology, target tissues and consequently treatment options. Therefore, there is an urgent need
for a deeper understanding of the host–pathogen interaction biology of SARS-CoV-2, which
in turn may offer important insights into general/personalized treatment strategies and
management of the disease as well as development of new therapies.
Probability of contracting this highly contagious infection has been reported to be similar
across age groups but the clinical manifestations in the elderly patients appear to be more
severe7–10. Besides, increased mortality has been reported in COVID-19 patients with
comorbidities such as cancer, hypertension, diabetes etc10,11. However, the reported global
case-fatality rate (CFR) among aged patients with or without comorbidities are notably higher7–
10
. Collectively, these observations suggest that there may be a comparatively stronger
association between age and poor prognosis of COVID-19, but this may well be multifactorial.
Therefore, uncovering mechanism(s) underlying poor prognosis to SARS-CoV-2 infection
among the affected elderly might be insightful for effective patient management and treatment.
It is reasonably argued that with the aging process, elderly population may be susceptible to
various disorders such as lung infection, pneumonia, cardiovascular disorder, cancer or general
age-related health problems12–15. Several reports also suggest that dysregulation of cellular
oxidant/antioxidant systems and higher baseline levels of proinflammatory mediators, such as
C-reactive protein, TNF-α, IL−1β and IL−6 as well as decrease in several stem and progenitor
cell populations (that provide the lung with a remarkable regenerative capacity upon injury)
occur in elderly people that might overlap with viral mediated dysregulation15–18.
Based on this limited understanding, we hypothesize that expression of genes that changes
during aging, might get further augmented on SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to severe
outcome in elderly patient. We attempted to explore this possibility by performing comparative
transcriptomics using available data from two target tissues namely lung and blood in healthy
aging group and COVID-19 patients. We also compared transcriptomic profile of aging lung
and blood with host genes interacting with SARS-CoV-2 protein. We observed a significant
overlap between gene expression profile in both lung and blood of healthy aging group and
COVID-19 patients; which was much more pronounced in blood. Furthermore, there was a
significant overlap between host genes interacting SARS-CoV-2 proteins in aging blood but
not in lungs. These observations support previous reports that SARS-COV-2, primarily affects
the respiratory system but its effects may manifest in blood leading to multiorgan failure in
severe cases of COVID-195,19.

Study Design:
Identification of candidate genes
In order to identify genes that determine poor prognosis in the elderly COVID-19 patients, we
performed a comparative analysis of gene expression data collected from Broncho Alveolar
Lavage Fluid (BALF)/lung/blood from COVID-19 patients and healthy aging group; and data
of host genes interacting with SARS-COV-2 proteins with transcription profile of aging lung
and blood (resources are mentioned below). Overlaps between the following groups were
documented: i) Patients’ BALF with healthy aging lung; ii) Patients’ PBMCs with healthy
aging blood; iii) Host genes interacting with viral proteins with healthy aging lung and blood.
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance of these overlaps, if any, were tested using hypergeometric test
(http://nemates.org/MA/progs/overlap_stats_prog.html). Basic equation to find probability of
finding an overlap of genes using the above-mentioned program is provided in supplementary
text.
Pathway analysis
Pathway enrichment of the significantly overlapping genes identified above, was done using
EnrichR20,21 which is an integrative web-based and mobile software application that currently
includes 180184 annotated gene sets from 102 gene set libraries and various interactive
visualization approaches to display enrichment results using the JavaScrit library, Data Driven
Documents.
eQTL analysis
eQTL variants of genes from significantly overlapping gene-sets for respective tissues (lung
and blood) were obtained from GTEx version 8 (https://gtexportal.org). With a view to obtain
a universally applicable biomarker, a comparable minor allele frequency of the markers would
be ideal and such a suitability was tested using FST or fixation index. This was done using
1000 genome phase 1 data with the help of an online tool SPSmart (http://spsmart.cesga.es)
with FST i) 0 to 0.05 representing low; (ii) 0.05 to 0.15 - moderate; iii) 0.15 to 0.25 – high; and
(iv) >0.25 - very high, genetic differentiation.
Identification of druggable targets
Finally, these genes identified above were screened for their druggability with FDA approved
drugs using DGIdb website (http://dgidb.org).
Resources:
A. Age associated genes:
i)
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in lung and blood tissue identified by a
recently published study using RNA-Seq based transcriptome profiles from human
donors of various ages from GTEx22 were obtained.
ii)
DEGs from two stage transcriptomic study performed in blood, based on metaanalysis data from six different studies (n=7,074 samples) in the discovery phase
and 7,909 additional whole-blood samples in the replication phase23 were obtained.
These two datasets for blood transcriptomics were merged and all the protein coding genes
(and not any small RNAs such as miRNA, lncRNA etc) that are reported in either study were
considered. All genes showing a different direction of expression change were removed from
the analysis. A total of 2877 and 2283 protein coding genes were found to be up and down
regulated respectively in blood from healthy aging group. Similarly, a total of 363 and 592

protein coding genes were found be up and down regulated respectively in aging lung. These
genes have been subsequently referred to as “age-associated DEGs”.
B.1. SARS-CoV-2 associated genes:
DEGs in COVID-19 positive patients, henceforth referred to as “SARS-CoV2-associated
DEGs” were obtained from two recent studies:
i)
DEGs in BALFs identified comparing laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients
(SARS2) (n = 8, median age 50.5 years) with healthy controls without known
respiratory diseases (healthy) (n = 20)24.
ii)
DEGs in PBMCs and BALF identified by comparing three COVID-19 patients
(median age 37 years) and three healthy donors25.
BALF transcriptomics from these two datasets for were merged and all the protein coding
genes (and not any small RNAs such miRNA, lncRNA etc) that are reported in either study
were considered. All genes showing a different direction of expression change were removed
from the analysis.
B.2. Host genes interacting with SARS-CoV-2 proteins
Host genes that were found to be interacting with SARS-COV-2 viral proteins henceforth
referred as “SARS-CoV2-interacting genes” were collected from recent studies mentioned
below.
i)
332 high-confidence SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs) were
obtained by analyzing the data generated by expressing 26 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2
proteins in HEK293 cells in a recent study26.
ii)
Computation based interactome data consisting of 125 proteins (94 host proteins)
and 200 unique interactions which were generated using available sequences for
viral protein candidates (wS, wORF3a, wE, wM, wORF6, wORF7a, wORF7b,
wORF8, wN, and wORF10) as well as literature based mining27.
Results:
A comparative analysis of DEGs in the different sample sets described under study design
(Figure 2), revealed significant overlaps between them (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1) and
are briefly presented below. The most notable findings include i) significant overlap (p<1.4E04) between the up regulated SARS-CoV-2 associated DEGs in patients’ BALF and up
regulated age associated DEGs in healthy aging; ii) significant overlap (p<6.53E-07) between
the up regulated SARS-CoV-2 associated DEGs in patients’ PBMCs and up regulated age
associated DEGs in healthy aging blood; iii) nominally significant overlap (p<0.03) between
the down regulated SARS-CoV-2 associated DEGs in patients’ PBMCs and down regulated
age associated DEGs in healthy aging blood and iv) significant overlap between the SARSCoV-2 interacting genes and up (p<0.002)/down (p<1.04E-06) regulated age associated DEGs
in healthy aging blood (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1).

Pathway enrichment:
As the number of genes in each gene-set was very small to identify the enriched pathways, if
any, all the genes from significant gene-sets and showing change in same direction were
considered together for pathway enrichment analysis. Cytokine genes that are frequently found
to be upregulated in patients and which overlapped with healthy aging expression profiles were
also included. Six of the 21 up-regulated cytokine genes in patients, overlapped with aging
related genes in the blood but none with aging lung. Up regulated genes in the healthy aging
group that overlap with SARS CoV-2 associated genes and SARS-CoV-2 interacting genes
were seen to be enriched in a range of signaling pathways including p53, chemokine and
cytokine mediated inflammation, EGF receptor, TGF-beta, AGE-RAGE, Toll-like receptor
mediated, NF-kappa B, VEGFA-VEGFR2 and genes involved in ROS in triggering vascular
inflammation, oxidoreductive damage, T cell polarization, lung fibrosis, Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disorder (COPD), local acute inflammatory response (representative pictures at
Figure 3; Supplementary Table 2). Down regulated genes in the healthy aging group that
overlap SARS CoV-2 associated and SARS-CoV-2 interacting genes were seen to be enriched
in pathways such as PI3K-Akt-mTOR-signaling, membrane trafficking, HIV and influenza
RNA transport, ISG15 antiviral mechanism, cellular export machinery that interacts with
NEP/NS2 (representative pictures at Figure 4; Supplementary Table 3).

eQTL analysis:
eQTL variants in genes from significantly overlapping gene-sets from the respective tissue
namely lung and blood were identified (Table 2, Supplementary Table 4). Fst test were
performed to identify variants with low genetic differentiation among different population. A
large number of eQTL variants with Fst<0.05 were found in each group (Table 2,
Supplementary Table 4). Further analysis of these may enable identification of variant(s) which
could be used as a biomarker(s).

Identification of druggable gene targets:
It may be mentioned that SARS-CoV-2 interacting genes were excluded from this analysis
since they have already been reported previously26. Efforts to identify novel druggable targets
for FDA approved drugs from among 259 genes from significantly overlapping gene sets
between different groups shown above (Table 1), yielded a total of 48 druggable genes mostly
from the immune system related pathways. A total of 205 FDA approved drugs could
potentially target them (Supplementary Table 5).
Discussion:
COVID-19, the recent pandemic has affected individuals of all age groups as well as all
ethnicities. However, poor prognosis has been witnessed in the elderly effected group with or
without comorbidities7–10. The overall CFR for cases with age 70 to 79 years is 8.0% and for
cases with age 80 years and above it is 14.8%; which is strikingly higher compared to 0.4% in
cases below 50 years of age, based on a study that included 72314 cases from China28. It is
well known that with aging there is a notable increase in circulating pro-inflammatory
cytokines even in the absence of an immunological threat and also a reduction in proteins that
maintain homeostasis of the immune system, thus entailing a greater risk for many diseases
(cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders, COPD, lung cancer, interstitial lung
disease etc)14,15,29,30. Thus, we reasoned that comparing naturally occurring, age-dependent
transcriptional changes with those observed in COVID19 patients and/or known SARS-COV2 interacting proteins may provide insights into the age-associated poor prognosis in COVID19.

Three noteworthy findings emerged from our study: i) a significant overlap was witnessed
between DEGs in patients’ BALF/blood and in aging lung and blood; ii) this overlap was more
pronounced in blood compared to lung; and iii) a similar overlap between SARS-CoV-2
interacting proteins and DEGs in aging blood but not in lung (Table 1) and warranting
discussion. These overlaps suggest a cumulative effect of aging and COVID-19 infection on
expression of important genes which may be conferring poor prognosis in the elderly. Results
of pathway enrichment analysis in both up-regulated and down-regulated genes (Figures 3,4;
Supplementary Tables 2,3) lend good support to this interpretation. We observed that genes
involved in pathways such as pro-inflammatory, apoptotic, T cell polarization were upregulated and those involved in viral replication suppression or the first barrier to viral infection
remained downregulated in the elderly (Figures 3, 4; Supplementary Tables 2,3). Based on this,
it may be proposed that on SARS-CoV-2 infection, expression of these genes changes further,
thus causing lowered immunity, enhanced pro-inflammatory response and apoptosis which in
turn may lead to poor prognosis.
As for the second novel observation, the higher extent of overlap between SARS-CoV-2
associated/SARS-CoV-2 interacting genes and DEGs in blood among the heathy aging group,
may explain the range of clinical symptoms including high prevalence of blood clots, strokes
and heart attack as well as multi-organ failure in a subset of severe patients reported early on
during this pandemic3,4. Our observations are corroborated by a recent report of SARS-CoV-2
mediated damage to endothelial cells lining the blood vessels probably leading to blood
clotting, strokes and heart attacks19. Furthermore, our observations suggest an over activation
of T cell polarization and TGF-beta pathways in affected elderly patients (Figure 3), which can
cause functional exhaustion of T cells31,32. A recent study suggests T cell counts are reduced
significantly in COVID-19 patients, and the surviving T cells appear functionally exhausted in
severe cases33.
Taken together these observations, eQTLs in the genes identified in our study (Table 2,
Supplementary Table 4) may also confer poor prognosis in young patients but this may worsen
with age and co-morbidities. However, their utility as prognostic biomarkers across different
populations may be assessed only when more patient data become available and these genes
are characterized in COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, variants with Fst>0.05 may be
tested for correlation with population specific severity. Additionally, identification of genes
involved in influenza and HIV infection in our study (Figure 3,4; Supplementary Table 2,3)
may be of considerable relevance for drug repurposing for treatment of COVID-19 patients.
In summary, our analysis i) identified probable candidate genes for poor prognosis among the
affected elderly group; ii) identified potential druggable targets as well as FDA approved drugs
opening the possibility of drug repurposing; and iii) seems to provide early explanation for
manifestation of blood related symptoms and probably multiorgan damage. Finally, though
these leads are preliminary based on a very limited patient dataset, the model holds promise to
be tested as and when more tissue specific patient derived data from different age groups and/or
from different populations become available.
Limitation: Our study is limited by non-availability of large tissue specific transcriptomic
datasets of COVID19 patients across age groups, and with varying severity and from different
populations to validate the hypothesis.
