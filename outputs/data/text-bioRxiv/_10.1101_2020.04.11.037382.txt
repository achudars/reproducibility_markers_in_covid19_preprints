ABSTRACT

25

SARS-CoV-2 emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and has since infected over 1.5

26

million people, of which over 107,000 have died. As SARS-CoV-2 spreads across the planet,

27

speculations remain about the range of human cells that can be infected by SARS-CoV-2. In this

28

study, we report the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from two COVID-19 patients in Toronto, Canada.

29

We determined the genomic sequences of the two isolates and identified single nucleotide

30

changes in representative populations of our virus stocks. More importantly, we tested a wide

31

range of human immune cells for productive infection with SARS-CoV-2. Here we confirm that

32

human primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are not permissive to SARS-CoV-

33

2. As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, it is essential to monitor small nucleotide

34

polymorphisms in the virus and to continue to isolate circulating viruses to determine cell

35

susceptibility and pathogenicity using in vitro and in vivo infection models.

TEXT

38

A new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in

39

December 2019 in Wuhan, China (1). SARS-CoV-2 has since spread to 185 countries and

40

infected over 1.7 million people, of which over 107,000 have died (2). The first case of COVID-

41

19 was detected in Toronto, Canada on January 23, 2020 (3). Multiple cases have since been

42

identified across Canada. As SARS-CoV-2 spreads globally, the virus is likely to adapt and

43

evolve. It is critical to isolate SARS-CoV-2 viruses to characterize their ability to infect and

44

replicate in multiple human cell types and to determine if the virus is evolving in its ability to

45

infect human cells and cause severe disease. Isolating the virus also provides us with the

46

opportunity to share the virus with other researchers to facilitate the development and testing of

47

diagnostics, drugs and vaccines.

48
49

In this study, we describe how we isolated and determined the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-

50

2 from two Toronto COVID-19 patients (SARS-CoV-2/SB2 and SARS-CoV-2/SB3-TYAGNC).

51

In addition, we studied the replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2/SB3-TYAGNC in human

52

structural and immune cells. Importantly, we report that although a human lung cell line

53

supported SARS-CoV-2 replication, the virus did not propagate in any of the tested immune cell

54

lines or primary human immune cells. Interestingly, although we did not observe a productive

55

infection in CD4+ primary T cells, we observed virus-like particles in these cells by electron

56

microscopy. Our data shed light on a wider range of human cells that may or may not be

57

permissive for SARS-CoV-2 replication and our studies strongly suggest that a broad range of

58

human immune cells are unlikely to support SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients.

METHODS

60

Cells

61

Vero E6 cells (African green monkey cells; ATCC, https://www.atcc.org) were maintained in

62

Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s media (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;

63

Sigma-Aldrich, https://www.sigmaaldrich.com), 1x L-Glutamine and Penicillin/Streptomycin

(Pen/Strep; Corning, https://ca.vwr.com). Calu-3 cells (human lung adenocarcinoma derived;

65

ATCC, https://www.atcc.org) were cultured as previously mentioned (4). THF cells (human

66

telomerase life-extended cells) were cultured as previously mentioned (5). THP-1 cells

67

Penicillin/streptomycin and 0.05 mM beta-mercaptoethanol. THP-1 cells were differentiated into

70

macrophages and dendritic cells using 50 ng/ml GM-CSF (R&D Systems,

71

https://www.rndsystems.com) + 50 ng/ml M-CSF (R&D Systems, https://www.rndsystems.com)

72

and 50 ng/ml GM-CSF + 500 U/ml IL-4 (Biolegend, https://www.biolegend.com), respectively.

73

PBMCs from healthy donors (n=2; OM8066 and OM8067) were purified into CD4+, CD8+,

74

CD19+, monocytes and others (CD4- CD8- CD19- cells) using CD4 negative selection kit

75

(STEMCELL Technologies, https://www.stemcell.com), CD8 positive selection kit

76

(STEMCELL Technologies, https://www.stemcell.com), PE positive selection kit (STEMCELL

77

Technologies, https://www.stemcell.com) and Monocyte negative selection kit (STEMCELL

78

Technologies, https://www.stemcell.com), respectively. For purity of cell types, see

79

supplementary figure 1. CD4+, CD8+, CD19+ and CD4- CD8- CD19- cells were resuspended in

80

R-10 media (RPMI + 2 mM L-glutamine + 10% FBS + Penicillin/streptomycin) + 20 U/ml IL-2

81

(Biolegend, https://www.biolegend.com). Primary monocytes were resuspended in R-10 media.

82

Work with PBMCs was approved by the Research Ethics Boards of St. Michael’s Hospital and

83

the University of Toronto (REB 20-044).

84

Virus isolation and quantification

85

Vero E6 cells were seeded at a concentration of 3x105 cells/well in a 6-well plate. Next day,

86

200 µl of mid-turbinate swabs, collected from two COVID-19 patients in viral transport media

87

was mixed with 200 µl of DMEM containing 16 µg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin. The cells were

88

infected with the inoculum for 1 hr. Next, the inoculum was replaced with DMEM containing

89

2% FBS and 8 µg/ml TPCK-treated trypsin. The cells were observed daily under a light

90

microscope. Supernatant from the cells were used to determine virus titres (TCID50/ml) using

91

Spearman and Karber’s method (6, 7) as outlined previously (8).

Quantitative real time PCR

93

To detect SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture supernatant, 140 uL of supernatant was removed and

94

detection of viral nucleic acids was performed by RT-PCR using an adaptation of Corman et

95

al.’s protocol (9). Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from infected cells using QIAamp viral RNA

96

kit (Qiagen, https://www.qiagen.com) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The RT-PCR

97

reactions were carried out using Luna Universal qPCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs,

98

https://www.neb.ca) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Two separate gene targets were

99

used for detection, the 5’ untranslated region (UTR) and the envelope (E) gene. Primers and

100

probes used were: 5’-UTR For: GTTGCAGCCGATCATCAGC; 5’-UTR Rev:

101

GACAAGGCTCTCCATCTTACC; 5’-UTR probe: FAM-

104

E-gene probe: CAL Fluor Orange 560-ACACTAGCCATCCTTACTGCGCTTCG-BHQ-1. The

105

cycling conditions were: 1 cycle of denaturation at 60°C for 10 minutes then 95°C for 2 minutes

106

followed by 44 amplification cycles of 95°C for 10s and 60°C for 15s. Analysis was performed

107

using the Rotor-Gene Q software (Qiagen, https://www.qiagen.com) to determine cycle

108

thresholds (Ct).

109

Electron Microscopy

110

Samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Sigma-Aldrich,

111

https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/) for 1 hr. Pellets were washed with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH

112

7.0) and post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) for 1 hr.

113

Pellets were washed with distilled water and en-bloc stained with 2% uranyl acetate in distilled

114

water for 2 hrs. Pellets were washed with distilled water and dehydrated in an ethanol series.

115

Pellets were infiltrated with Embed 812/Araldite resin and cured at 65 degrees for 48 hrs. Resin

116

blocks were trimmed, polished and 90 nm thin sections were ultramicrotomed (Leica Reichert

117

Ultracut E, https://www.leica-microsystems.com) and mounted on TEM grids. Thin sections

118

were stained with 5% uranyl acetate and 5% lead citrate. Sections were imaged using

119

Transmission Electron Microscopy (ThermoFisher Scientific Talos L120C,

120

https://www.thermofisher.com) using a LaB6 filament at 120kV. 10 fields per cell type were

121

scanned. Each field was imaged with different magnifications at 2600x, 8500x, 17500x and

122

36000x.

123

Flowcytometry

124

100µL (400,000 cells) of primary CD4+, CD8+, CD19+ and monocytes were washed with 1 ml of

125

phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and spun at 500 g for 5 minutes. The cells were resuspended in

126

100 µL of Live/Dead Violet (ThermoFisher Scientific, https://www.thermofisher.com) as per

127

manufacturer’s recommendation and diluted 1:1000 in PBS. Cells were incubated at 4°C for 30

128

minutes. Next, cells were washed with 1 ml of FACS buffer (in-house reagent) and spun at 500 g

129

for 5 minutes. Cells were then stained with 100 µL of their respective stains (aCD4-FITC,

130

aCD8-FITC, aCD19-FITC, aCD14-APC; Biolegend, https://www.biolegend.com) at a

131

concentration of 1µg/mL for 30 min at 4°C. After staining, the cells were washed with 1mL of

132

FACS Buffer and spun at 500 g for 5 minutes. Extra aliquots of cells were left unstained, which

133

were also spun at 500g for 5 minutes. The pellets were resuspended in 100 µL of 1%

134

paraformaldehyde (PFA; ThermoFisher Scientific, https://www.thermofisher.com) and analyzed.

135

Samples were run on the BD LSR Fortessa X20 (BD, https://www.bdbiosciences.com). Cells

136

were gated on Live/Dead negative to exclude debris and dead cells and were then gated on their

137

respective cell surface markers to assess purity.

Sequencing

139

RNA was extracted from the supernatant of Vero E6 cells that were inoculated with clinical

140

specimens after 1 passage using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen,

141

https://www.qiagen.com/us/) without addition of carrier RNA. dsDNA for sequencing library

142

preparation was synthesized using the Liverpool SARS-CoV-2 amplification protocol (10). Two

143

100 µM primer pools were prepared by combining primer pairs in an alternating fashion to

144

prevent amplification of overlapping regions in a single reaction. In a PCR tube, 1µL Random

145

Primer Mix (ProtoScript II First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit, New England Biolabs,

146

https://www.neb.ca) was added to 7 µL extracted RNA and denatured on SimpliAmp thermal

147

cycler (ThermoFisher Scientific, https://www.thermofisher.com) at 65°C for 5 min and then

148

incubated on ice. 10 µL 2X ProtoScript II Reaction Mix and 2 µL 10X ProtoScript II Enzyme

149

Mix were then added to the denatured sample and cDNA synthesis performed using the

150

following conditions: 25°C for 5 min, 48°C for 15 min and 80°C for 5 min. After cDNA

151

synthesis, in a new PCR tube 2.5 µL cDNA was combined with 12.5 µL Q5 High-Fidelity 2X

152

Master Mix (NEB, Ipswich, USA), 8.8 µL nuclease free water (ThermoFisher Scientific,

153

https://www.thermofisher.com), and 1.125 µL of 100 µM primer pool #1 or #2. PCR cycling was

154

then performed as follows: 98°C for 30 sec followed by 40 cycles of 98°C for 15 sec and 65°C

155

for 5 min.

156
157

All PCR reactions were purified using RNAClean XP (Beckman Coulter,

158

https://www.beckmancoulter.com) at 1.8x bead to amplicon ratio and eluted in 30 µL. 2 µL of

159

amplified material was quantified using a Qubit 1X dsDNA (ThermoFisher Scientific,

161

libraries were prepared using Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep Kit and Nextera DNA CD Indexes

162

(Illumina, https://www.illumina.com) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Paired-end 150

163

bp sequencing was performed for each library on a MiniSeq with the 300-cycle mid-output

164

reagent kit (Illumina, https://www.illumina.com), multiplexed with targeted sampling of ~40,000

165

clusters per library. Sequencing reads from pool #1 and pool #2 were combined (as R1 and R2),

166

amplification primer sequences removed using cutadapt (version 1.18) (11), and Illumina adapter

167

sequences were removed and low quality sequences trimmed or removed using Trimmomatic

168

(version 0.36) (12). Final sequence quality and confirmation of adapter/primer trimming were

169

confirmed by FASTQC (version 0.11.5) (13). SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were assembled

170

using UniCycler (version 0.4.8; default settings, except for --mode conservative) (14) and

171

assembly statistics generated by QUAST (version 5.0.2) (15). Sequencing depth and

172

completeness of coverage of the assembled genomes was additionally assessed by Bowtie2

173

(version 2.3.4.1) (16) alignment of the sequencing reads against the assembled contigs and

174

stastistics generated by ngsCAT (version 0.1) (17). Sequence variation in the assembled genomes

175

was assessed by BLASTN against SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences available in GenBank as

176

well as BreSeq (version 0.35.0) (18) analysis relative to GenBank entry MN908947.3 (first

177

genome sequence reported from the original Wuhan outbreak, China).

RESULTS

180

To facilitate virus isolation, we collected mid-turbinate swabs from two COVID-19 patients in

181

Toronto, Canada and transported the swabs in viral transport media to a high containment level 3

182

facility. We inoculated Vero E6 cells with the samples and observed for cytopathic effects (CPE)

183

daily. Seventy-two hours post infection (hpi), cells inoculated with both samples displayed

184

extensive CPE, relative to mock inoculated cells (Figure 1, panel A). We collected 200 uL of cell

185

culture supernatant and re-infected a fresh layer of Vero E6 cells. Twenty-four hours post

186

infection, both wells containing cells that were re-inoculated displayed extensive CPE (Figure 1,

187

panel B). We extracted viral RNA from the supernatant and confirmed the presence of SARS-

188

CoV-2 using a diagnostic quantitative real-time PCR assay (qPCR; Figure 1, panel C). We also

189

confirmed the presence of coronavirus-like particles in infected Vero E6 cells by electron

190

microscopy (Figure 1, panel D).

191
192

Next, we performed genome sequencing of both isolates, generating nearly complete genome

193

sequences with 7500-8000 fold coverage and ~94% completeness, with only ~260 bp and ~200

194

bp at the 5’ and 3’ termini undetermined (Table 1). Both shared synonymous and non-

195

synonymous substitutions with those independently observed in direct sequencing of clinical

196

isolates (Table 1; Mubareka & McArthur, unpublished). SARS-CoV-2/SB2 additionally

197

contained a non-synonymous substitution at position 2832 (K856R in ORF1ab polyprotein) and

198

three regions with mutations or a deletion supported by a minority of sequencing reads, while

199

SARS-CoV-2/SB3-TYAGNC only had an additional synonymous substitution in ORF1ab

200

polyprotein (Y925Y) plus a minority of sequencing reads supporting another synonymous

201

substitution in the ORF3a protein (I7I). As such, SARS-CoV-2/SB3-TYAGNC was used for

202

subsequent studies as best representative of patient infections. Raw sequencing reads for each

203

isolate are available in NCBI BioProject PRJNA624792. Only sequencing reads that aligned by

204

Bowtie2 to the MN908947.3 SARS-CoV-2 genome were included in the deposited sequence

205

files.

207

To determine the replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in human structural and immune cells, we

208

infected Calu-3 (lung adenocarcinoma epithelial), THF (telomerase life extended human

209

fibroblasts), Vero E6 (African green monkey kidney epithelial), THP-1 (monocytes and

210

differentiated macrophages and dendritic cells) and primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells

211

(PBMCs) from healthy human donors (CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, monocytes and other PBMCs;

212

Supplementary Figure S1) with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. We monitored virus

213

replication over a period of 72 hours in the cell lines (Figure 2). We also determined virus

214

replication in PBMCs from healthy donors over a period of 48 hours (Figure 2). SARS-CoV-2

215

propagated to high titres in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells (Figure 2). SARS-CoV-2 did not replicate

216

efficiently in THF cells (Figure 2). Interestingly, human immune cell lines and primary PBMCs

217

from healthy donors did not support SARS-CoV-2 replication (Figure 2)

218
219

To further support virus replication data, we imaged infected human structural and immune cells

220

using electron microscopy (Figure 3). We scanned 10 different fields per cell type, each using

221

four different magnifications of 2600x, 8500x, 17500x and 36000x to determine if the cell

222

populations contained virus-like particles. Virus-like particles were detected in 7/10 fields in

223

Vero E6 cells and 8/10 fields in Calu-3 cells (Figure 3, panels A and B). Interestingly, we also

224

detected virus-like particles in 2/10 fields in primary CD4+ T cells (Figure 3, panel C). We did

225

not observe any virus-like particles in other human immune cells that were experimentally

226

infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3, panels D-J).

229

In this study, we report the isolation of two replication competent SARS-CoV-2 isolates from

230

COVID-19 patients in Canada. Although we used TPCK-treated trypsin to enhance infection

231

using clinical specimens (Figure 1, panel A), subsequent infection and virus replication did not

232

require any additional TPCK-treated trypsin (Figure 1, panel B). We sequenced both isolates to

233

confirm that they were reflective of isolates infecting patients worldwide, selecting SARS-CoV-

234

2/ SB3-TYAGNC for experimental investigation as its sequencing produced less minority

235

sequencing reads (Table 1).

236
237

SARS-CoV caused the 2004 pandemic of SARS. SARS-CoV can infect structural (19) and

238

immune cell lines (20) from humans in vitro. We infected a wide range of human cell

239

populations with SARS-CoV-2/SB3-TYAGNC to identify cell types that can support productive

240

infection of SARS-CoV-2. Both Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells supported virus replication to high

241

titres (Figure 2), as reported in other recent studies (21, 22). hTERT life-extended human

242

fibroblast cells (THF) did not support virus replication (Figure 2). In addition, human immune

243

cell populations, including cell lines (THP-1) and primary cells (PBMCs) did not support

244

productive SARS-CoV-2 replication (Figure 2). Interestingly, although primary CD4+ T cells did

245

not support productive virus replication, we observed virus-like particles in these cells by

246

electron microscopy (Figure 3, panel C). This is consistent with a recent report by Wang and

247

colleagues where they demonstrated that human T cell lines could be infected with SARS-CoV-2

248

(23). However, the study by Wang et al. did not quantify virus titres in the supernatant from

249

infected cells. In our study, we could not detect any replication competent virus in the

250

supernatant that was collected from SARS-CoV-2 infected CD4+ T cells (Figure 3).

252

In this study, we show that primary human T cells (CD4+ and CD8+) do not support productive

253

virus replication. However, our electron micrographs demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 likely

254

replicates in CD4+ T cells, but the replication cycle is likely terminated prior to virus maturation

255

and egress. Thus, more work is needed to fully identify the susceptibility and permissivity of

256

CD4+ T cells to SARS-CoV-2.
