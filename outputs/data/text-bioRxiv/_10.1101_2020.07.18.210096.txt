Evaluation of diversity levels in HIV-1 virus integrase gene sequences,
supporting the lack of target specificity of ivermectin versus the
integrase-importin complex in SARS-CoV-2 infection

Summary

Therapies with new drugs have been appearing in tests worldwide as potential
inhibitors of sars-cov-2 virus replication. Recently, one of these drugs, Ivermectin,
was reported as an inhibitor of the nuclear import of HIV-1 proteins in vitro, soon
becoming the target of an international prospecting work (not yet published), with
patients tested for COVID-19. However, understanding the evolutionary aspects
of the biological components involved in the complex drug-nuclear import helps
in understanding how these relationships exist in the deactivation of viral
infections. Thus, 153 sequences of the HIV-1 integrase gene were analyzed for
their genetic structure and molecular diversity and the presence of two distinct
groups for the Gene and not only one, was detected; As well as different degrees
of structuring for each of these groups. These results support the interpretation
of the lack of conservation of the HIV-1 gene and that the number of existing
polymorphisms, only for this structure of the complex, implies the non-efficiency
of a drug at population levels. Thus, the molecular diversity found in HIV-1 can
be extrapolated to other viruses, such as Including, sars-cov-2 and the
functionality of the drug, interacting with the integrase-importin complex, can be
further decreased.

1. INTRODUCTION

As a flattening measure of the growth curve of the number of cases of
COVID-19 in Brazil, the recommendations of the Ministry of Health continue to
be limited to the monitoring and containment of the virus as well as to those of
maintaining social distancing, the use of face protection masks and constant hand
washing. These recommendations, which follow the recommendations of all the
world's health agencies, seem to be the most effective to inhibit the outbreak of
this pandemic, which, as a direct consequence of non-control, would result in the
breakdown of our health system (MINISTÉRIO DA SAÚDE, 2020).
However, a number of therapies are in tests worldwide and these range
from vaccines to the use of some drugs (WHO, 2020). With regard to the new
drugs tested to combat COVID-19, a not-so-new one (for other treatments) called
IVERMECTIN, figured as an alternative for its power to inhibit the replication of
the SARS-CoV-2 virus in vitro. Ivermectin, a pre-tested food and drug
administration (FDA) for antiparasitic use, demonstrated broad-spectrum antiviral
activity in vitro for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and even two hours after infection was
able to reduce the amount of viral RNA by approximately 5,000 times after 48
hours. This made ivermectin a candidate for in-depth investigations for possible
human benefits (CALY, L. et al., 2020).
Even thinking about the "in vitro" characteristics of the study with
ivermectin, its usefulness and potentiality as therapy did not reach exhaustion.
Contrary to some drugs such as Chloroquine and hydroxichloroquine, discarded
by who and many health agencies and research centers around the world, it
ended up becoming a target in an international, multicenter and observational
prospecting work, controlled on a case-by-case basis, using data collected from
patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1 and March 31, 2020.
These patients were exposed to doses of Ivermectin compared to patients with
COVID-19 who received medical treatment without ivermectin. In this study (in
vivo) and not yet published, the researchers assume that, in addition to being
safe for use, the administration of ivermectin in patients hospitalized with COVID19 was directly associated with the fact that a lower mortality and a shorter length
of hospital stay, making the difference in the survival of hospitalized patients
(PATEL A.N. et al., 2020).

The question then became the understanding of how ivermectin acted in
the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, since as an antiparasitic agent the issue
of its antiviral activity was still unknown. In some studies (BOLDESCU et al, 2017;
CALY et al, 2020; FRIEMAN et al, 2007; CAO et al., 2020; GREIN et al., 2020;
FERNER et al., 2020; CRUMP et al., 2017), ivermectin had been reported as an
inhibitor of the nuclear import of viral proteins, as the non-structural protein of the
tumor antigen of the ape virus SV40 (an old known molecular biology as cloning
vector in ancient techniques of recombinant DNA technology), and also acting in
the limitation of infections of other RNA viruses such as viruses of types 1 to 4 of
dengue, West Nile, Venezuelan equine encephalitis and influenza. Until, in
studies with the HIV-1 virus (human immunodeficiency virus type 1), it was finally
associated with the breakdown of the interaction between the ENZYME
INTEGRASE of the HIV-1 virus and the heterodimer α / β1 of IMPORTIN, which
is the protein responsible for the nuclear import of the INTEGRASE itself.
Since the decade of 1990, the role of integrase as an inhibitor of HIV
replication has been suggested by scientists as a promising opportunity in the
treatment of viral infections because it is a highly conserved enzyme from an
evolutionary point of view and therefore with less genetic variability (SPRINZ, E.
2016). Because it is very conserved, it has greater difficulty in selecting mutations
associated with resistance, besides presenting potential synergism with other
RNA viruses, including those viruses that had resistance to reverse transcriptase
inhibitors. (PURAS L. et al, 1995); (ROBINSON, W.E., 1998) (BEALE K.K.,
ROBINSON W.E. JR. 2000); (REINKE R, STEFFEN N.R., ROBINSON W.E. JR.
2001)
Although it has been tested in humans for three decades (SMART, T.
1996), its development has been quite "truncated" by the high cost of production
and its pharmacokinetic limitations (such as low selectivity due to integrase,
difficulties encountered in its injectable use and short half-life time) preventing its
clinical use (SPRINZ, E. 2016). However, understanding the evolutionary aspects
of this enzyme can help the scientific community understand what possible
relationships exist between it and the drugs that interact in its connection with
IMPORTIN, especially in the role of destabilization of the import complex that
disables viral infections, such as ivermectin.

Thinking like this, the team of the Laboratory of Population Genetics and
Computational Evolutionary Biology (LaBECom-UNIVISA) designed a study of
phylogeny and molecular variance analysis to evaluate the possible levels of
genetic diversity and polymorphisms existing in a PopSet of the integrase gene
of human immunodeficiency virus 1collected in a Russian population of
Kyrgyzstan and available at GENBANK.

2. OBJECTIVE

Evaluate the possible levels of genetic diversity and polymorphisms
existing in 153 sequences of the integrase gene of human immunodeficiency
virus 1 in the Kyrgyzstan population.

3. METHODOLOGY

3.1.

DATABANK: The 153 gene sequences of the integrase gene of
human immunodeficiency virus 1 were collected from GENBANK
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/popset/?term=MN888087.1

and

participate in a PopSet dipped by Totmenin and collaborators on
March 25, 2020 (Popset:1822236350).

3.2.

PHYLOGENETICS ANALYSES: For phylogenetic analyses, the
previously described nucleotide sequences were used. The
sequences were aligned using the MEGA X program (TAMURA et
al., 2018) and gaps were extracted for the construction of
phylogenetic trees.

3.3.

GENETIC STRUCTURING ANALYSES: Paired FST estimators
were obtained with the software Arlequin v. 3.5 (EXCOFFIER et al.,
2005) using 1000 random permutations. The FST matrix generated
by the software was used in the construction of a dendrogram
based on the UPGMA distance method with the MEGA X software
(TAMURA et al., 2018) and the FST and geographic distance
matrices were not compared.

4. RESULTS

4.1. General properties of integrase gene sequences of the HIV-1 human
virus

Of the 153 sequences of the gene segment of the integrase gene of human
immunodeficiency virus 1 with 882 bp of extension, the analyses revealed the
presence of 343 polymorphic sites and of these, 70 sites were parsimoniously
informative. The graphical representation of these sites could be seen in a logo
built with the WEBLOGO 3 program (CROOKS et al., 2004), where the size of
each nucleotide is proportional to its frequency for certain sites. (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Graphic representation of 70 parsimonious-informative sites of the integrase gene of
human immunodeficiency virus 1.

Using the UPGMA method, based on the 70 parsimony-informative sites,
it was possible to understand that the 153 haplotypes comprised two distinct
groups, here called Bishkek and Osh, in reference to their collection origin and
no haplotype sharing was observed between the two groups (Figure 2).

estimated pairs using the Tamura 3 parameter model, and then selecting the topology with a
higher log probability value. This analysis involved 153 nucleotide sequences. There was a total
of 70 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were performed on MEGA X [2].

4.2. Genetic Distance Analysis
Analyses based on FST values also confirmed the presence of two distinct
genetic entities, with a component of variation greater than 36% and with p value
lower than 0.05 with significant evolutionary divergences within the groups (table

comprised the Oshi group, as well as a greater evolutionary divergence between
the sequences that comprised the Bishkek group (table 2); (table 3).

4.3. Molecular Variance Analysis (AMOVA)
Molecular variation analyses of the 153 sequences of the integrase gene
of human immunodeficiency virus 1 revealed very significant FST values (FST =
0.36) when analyzed as distinct and even more significant groups when their
internal differences were analyzed (in both groups) (Table 4).

4.4. Molecular diversity analyses
Molecular diversity analyses estimated by θ reflected a significant level of
mutations among all haplotypes (transitions and transversions). Indel mutations
(insertions or deletions) were not found in either of the two groups studied. The
D tests of Tajima and Fs de Fu showed disagreements between the estimates of
general θ and π, but with negative and highly significant values, indicating an
absence of population expansion. The irregularity index (R= Raggedness) with
parametric bootstrap simulated new values θ for before and after a supposed
demographic expansion and in this case assumed a value equal to zero for the
groups (Table 6); (Table 7).

5. DISCUSSION
As

methodologies had not yet been used in this PopSet, in this study it was possible
to detect the existence of these two distinct groups for the integrase gene of
human immunodeficiency virus 1 in the Kyrgyz region.
The groups described here seem to correspond to two HIV-1
subpopulations that co-exist in the same locality and that had their genetic
distances supported by FST analyses using the marker in question and its
structure sufficiently significant for such interpretation. Different degrees of
structuring were detected for each group, being essentially smaller among one of
them (Bishkek). These data suggest that the high degree of structuring present
in Oshi may be related to a loss of intermediate haplotypes over the generations,
possibly associated with an absence of gene flow.
These levels of structuring were also supported by simple phylogenetic
pairing methodologies such as UPGMA, which in this case, with a discontinuous
pattern of genetic divergence between the groups (supporting the occurrence of
geographic undercalculations resulting from past fragmentation events), was
observed a large number of branches with many mutational steps. These
mutations possibly settled by drift due to the founding effect, which accompanies
the dispersal behavior and/or loss of intermediate haplotypes over the
generations. The values found for genetic distance support the presence of this
discontinuous pattern of divergence between the studied groups, since they
considered important the minimum differences between the groups, when the
haplotypes between them were exchanged, as well as the inference of values
greater than or equal to that observed in the proportion of these permutations,
including the p value of the test.
The discrimination of the two genetic entities in the same locality was also
perceived when the inter-haplotypic variations were hierarchized in all covariance
components: by their intra and interindividual differences or by their intra- and
intergroup differences, generating dendrograms that supported the idea that the
significant differences found in the Bishkek group, for example, can even be

shared in their form, but not in their number, since the result of estimates of the
mean evolutionary divergence within the Oshi group were so low.
Since no relationship between genetic distance and geographic distance
was made in this study, the lack of gene flow (observed by non-haplotypic
sharing) should be supported by the presence of geographic barriers. The
estimators θ, although being extremely sensitive to any form of molecular
variation (Fu, 1997), supported the uniformity between the results found by all the
methodologies employed, and can be interpreted as a phylogenetic confirmation
that there is no consensus in the conservation of the gene of human
immunodeficiency virus integrase 1 in samples from the same geographical
region, being therefore safe to state that the large number of polymorphisms
existing , should be reflected, including, in its protein product (integrase enzyme).
This consideration provides certainty that an efficient response of drugs that
destabilize the integrase-importin link such as ivermectin should not be expected
for all HIV1 viruses from humans, whether they come from the same geographic
region (as this study shows), or even more from samples from geographically
distinct regions and thus, by extrapolating the levels of polymorphism and
molecular diversity found in the samples of this study , for other RNA viruses,
such as Sars-Cov-2, the integrase-importin relationship may be even more
diverse, and may bring less and less functionality to drugs that interact with it in
the role of destabilizing the integrase-importin complex, which in turn inhibit or
reduce the infectious potential of any RNA virus.
