Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we investigated
the interaction of this new coronavirus with Vero cells using high resolution scanning
electron microscopy. Surface morphology, the interior of infected cells and the distribution of
viral particles in both environments were observed 2 and 48 hours after infection. We showed
areas of viral processing, details of vacuole contents, and viral interactions with the cell
surface. Intercellular connections were also approached, and viral particles were adhered to
these extensions suggesting direct cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Keywords: SARS-CoV-2 morphogenesis; viral-host interactions; high resolution scanning
electron microscopy

1. Introduction
COVID-19 is an acute respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2—a novel
coronavirus identified during this pandemic [1]. The outbreak started at Wuhan in Hubei
province, China, in December 2019 [2]. Since then, the world has seen a rapid spread of the
virus with an increasing number of infected people—around 6 million cases and close to
400,000 deaths [3]. In the first four months, the outbreak has led to more than 28,000 deaths
in Brazil [4]. There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19. Patients
attendance is mainly based on supportive and symptomatic care. Therefore, a treatment
capable of inhibiting viral infection and/or replication is urgent.
SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense RNA beta-Coronavirus belonging to the
Coronaviridae family. The genome is packaged inside a helix capsid formed by the
nucleocapsid protein (N). Three other structural proteins are associated with the viral
envelope: membrane (M), envelope (E), and glycoprotein spike (S). Cellular entry of SARSCoV-2 depends on the binding of the S protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2
(ACE2)—a specific cellular receptor located on the surface of the host cell [5,6]. This is a
common receptor for SARS-CoV as well [7,8] (Li et al., 2003; 2005); this receptor facilitates
zoonotic transfer because these viruses can engage ACE2 from different animal species [9].
Beta-coronaviruses replicate in the cytoplasm; cellular compartments like the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi apparatus intermediate
compartiment (ERGIC) go through intense remodeling. This implies the contribution of host
membranes and organelles for viral replication. Therefore, remodeling of intracellular
membranes due to coronavirus infection is also observed for many RNA viruses [10].
After internalization and RNA release into the cytoplasm, a set of proteins is
synthesized triggering the formation of vesicles that become a viral platform ensuring
efficient replication and transcription of the RNA [11,12].

New coronavirus particles are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi
complex. Membrane budding between these compartments was reported in association with
N protein and genomic RNA along with M, E, and S proteins. The complete virions are
delivered to the extracellular environment following a conventional secretory route [13-15].
The research community has sought to better understand the genetic makeup of the
virus and thus discover how to effectively treat it. Social isolation for 14 days is the main way
to prevent the disease from spreading. Quarantine and lockdowns were implemented in cities
with high rates of infection and mortality [3]. Death is common in patients with severe
symptoms including shortness of breathing, fever, lethargy, respiratory failure, and/or
thrombosis [16,17].
Understanding the virus-cell interactions is key to vaccines, treatments, and
diagnoses. Most microscopic studies of SARS-CoV-2 were performed with transmission
electron microscopy. Here, we used high resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to
study inner cellular structures. The results offer evidence of infection-induced cellular
remodeling and the formation of a specialized region for viral morphogenesis. We also show
intercellular extensions for viral cell surfing. These observations offer new insights into the
transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

2. Material and Methods
Cells and Virus
SARS-CoV-2 isolate (HIAE-02: SARS-CoV-2/SP02/human/2020/BRA (GenBank accession
number MT126808.1) was used in this work. The virus was grown in Vero cells in the
Laboratory of Molecular Virology, at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Vero cells
were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) at 37 °C

and 5% CO2. All work involving infectious SARS-CoV2 was performed in a biosafety level
(BSL)-3 containment laboratory.
Infection assays
Semi-confluent (70%) cells were grown on sterile glass coverslips in 24-well tissue
culture plates infected with MOI (multiplicity of infection) values of 0.01, 0.1, or 1 using
SARS-CoV-2 in free-serum medium. Fresh medium containing 5% FBS was added after an
absorption period of 1.5 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were processed for electron
microscopy 2 or 48 hours post-infection (hpi).
High Resolution Scanning Electron Microscopy
After 2 or 48 hours post-infection (hpi), samples were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde
in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 2 h. The coverslips were washed with 0.1 M sodium
cacodylate buffer and post-fixed for 40 min in 1% OsO4 with 0.8% potassium ferrocyanide.
After another washing cycle, the samples were dehydrated through a series of increasing
concentration (30%–100%) of ethanol. The samples were critical-point-dried in liquid CO2 in
a Balzers CPD apparatus before monolayer scraping with Scotch tape™ as previously
described [18]. They were then sputtered with a 5-nm thick platinum coat in a Balzers
apparatus. Samples were observed using an Auriga ZEISS microscope operated between 1.0
and 1.8 Kv with resolution of 3072-2304 and aperture size of 20 µm.

3. Results
To identify alterations on the surface of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, we compared
their morphology and the occurrence of surface projections (SP). While we did not detect any
significant alteration in cell shape, the presence of SP increased on the surface of infected

cells at 2 hpi (Fig. 1A-C). However, no viral particles were adhered to the cell surface or
beneath these projections (Fig. 1D). At 48 hpi, we compared the surfaces of mock and
infected cells (MOI of 0.1) to highlight the presence of viral particles adhered to the smooth
cell surface and to the SP (Fig. 1E-F).
At the same time, and with a MOI of 1, viruses that egressed from a previous cycle of
infection were observed during the process of attachment to the cell plasma membrane (Fig.
2A). The corona-like features of the SARS-CoV-2 particles were discernible via SEM (Fig.
2B), and the measurements showed sizes of approximately 80 nm in diameter (Fig. 2C).
Removal of the host cell plasma membrane before platinum sputtering exposed the
interior of the mock and infected cells. While mock cells displayed a diffuse distribution of
organelles (Fig. 2D), infected cells exhibited a more polarized disposition of organelles and
pit-coated vesicles approximately 100 nm in diameter (Fig. 2E-F). With a MOI of 1, cells at
48 hpi showed a plethora of vacuoles (0.4 to 1 µm; Fig. 3A). These were translocated to the
cell plasma membrane presumably to perform exocytosis of viral particles (Fig. 3B). Some of
these vacuoles had their content revealed and were filled with immature viruses, amorphous
materials, or a hemocyte-like format (Fig. 3C-E). Although no virus-like particles could be
distinguished in the ER, bordering vesicles were observed on the vacuoles (Fig. 3D).
Cells at 48 hpi also had viral particles near the cell surface membrane ruffles (Fig.
4A) and a filopodium-like structure (Fig. 4B). Other viral particles were wrapped with thin (
70 nm) cellular projections that resemble nanotubes (Fig. 4C). Membrane bridges that
connect two cells showed the presence of virus particles on their surface (Figs. 4D-E).

4. Discussion

Part of the challenge in controlling COVID-19 is the innovative features of this
coronavirus. New knowledge on virus genetics and morphology needs to be analyzed
concurrently with viral “behavior” within the host cell as well as the dynamics that determine
the fate of the particle. To approach SARS-CoV-2/cell interactions, we investigate several
steps of virus infection at 2 and 48 hpi by SEM. This microscopic approach detailed virusinduced changes in the cell.
Our assays were performed using three MOIs (0.01; 0.1 and 1), and we could discern
the MOI of 0.1 as the more adequate for this type of study. This MOI allowed the best cell
conditions and distribution and also allowed visualization of virions through the cell surface
into the cell interior.
The absence of virions adhered to the cells surface at 2 hpi corroborates recent studies
performed by Belhaouari et al. [19] in which SARS-CoV-2 particles were only observed at
these loci after 12 hpi. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found lying on the cellular
surface at 48 hpi between surface projections and adhered to them. We also observed
probable viral particles inside vacuoles suggesting a secretion route. These aggregates of cell
organelles and components (Fig. 2F) may reflect the polarized release of virus previously
described for SARS-CoV [20].
All viruses measured by SEM display a spiky round shape with a size of around 70-85
nm in diameter considering a platinum coating of 5 nm. This agrees with the dimensions
described in recent studies [1,21,22].

4.1 Viral particles adhered to smooth surface and microvilli-like surface projetions
The effects on the surface morphology of infected cells varies among viruses.
Infection by several viruses including HTLV-IIIB leads to a loss of cell SP that are then

replaced by blebs [23]. Microvilli induction or increases were reported in several cases of
DNA or RNA viral infection [24,25]. For RNA viruses that egress by budding, e.g.,
influenza, the increase in SP of infected cells coincides with higher budding rates [26].
Similar to prior studies on SARS-CoV infection of Vero cells [27], we also observed
a ruffled host cell and thickened edges displaying a layered shape. These sites were
appropriate to register the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 particles (Fig. 2A) similar to
transmission electron microscopy images of the same early step of SARS-CoV infection of
Vero cells [28].
Likewise, the proliferation of SP on the infected cells, especially at the apical region
of these cells, is similar to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the abundance of
SARS-CoV-2 particles held on SP may facilitate the speed of viral propagation in the
epithelium of conducting airways from the lumen of the respiratory superior tract because
this environment is colonized by ciliated cells.

4.2 Vacuoles containing viral particles
Cell scraping is a very useful expedient that is occasionally used in studies of host
cell/parasite interactions [29,30]. Infected cells are artificially devoid of plasma membranes
and exposed to a myriad of vacuoles (Fig. 3A). Drastic vacuolization due to viral infection
was previously described for other RNA viruses including SARS-CoV [20,31]. Similar sites
were recently reported as virus morphogenesis matrix vesicae (VMMV) [19]. The particles
observed in the interior of these VMMVs (Fig. 3C-E) were previously described as doughnutlike particles when observed by electron microscopy [32,19]. SARS-CoV immature particles
are presumed to bud into vesicles as part of the assembly process, and thus the observed
particles were probably immature viruses devoid of the representative (corona) spikes of this
virion. Bordering vesicles were found in close association with the vacuoles (Fig. 3D), and

thus we speculate that their role in viral pre-components leads to discharge into the
compartments.
Studies with other coronaviruses identified large virion-containing vacuoles (LVCVs)
where the complete particle would bud. There is correlation between these structures as
observed by transmission electron microscopy and our data suggesting the occurrence of both
phenomena.

4.3 Translocation of vacuoles towards the plasma membrane
Coronaviruses infection leads to massive remodeling of cell membranes [33,34]; the
more condensed area depicted in the cytoplasm at 48 hpi (Fig. 2F) may correspond to the
main locus of viral morphogenesis. The proposed mechanism for the export of viruses to the
extracellular space is via fusion of the transport compartment membrane with the cell plasma
membrane [20].
The size of the vacuoles we observed in the cell periphery was not compatible with
the identified clathrin-coated pits because the vacuoles measure approximately 1 µm;
clathrin-coated pits measure near 200 nm in diameter. The presence of these endocytosisassociated players was recently reported in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. They are likely
receptacles to the nucleocapsid after the incoming virus is uncoated [19].
Thus, our observations suggest that a boost in vacuoles is restricted only to a specific
and more condensed part of the cytoplasm. This suggests translocation to the plasma
membrane is required for release the viral particles by a fusion mechanism.

4.4 Cellular bridges containing viral particles
Viral particles adhered to cell surface protrusions that were shown to connect two
cells. This observation suggests viral “cell surfing” previously described by other enveloped

viruses such as HIV and human metapneumovirus [35,36]. This mechanism is presumed to
allow the in vivo penetration of virus in mucosal surfaces that display microvilli-rich cells.
Actin filaments play a fundamental role in viral extrusion by the cell for both RNA
and DNA viruses. Actin offers the strength to discharge the progeny virus particles to the
extracellular medium, as occurs to some viruses that leave the cell by budding, including
Fowlpox and West Nile viruses [37,38]. Other examples include actin comets—these are an
efficient form of poxvirus dissemination and cell-to-cell HIV spreading, which involves the
direct engagement of GAG proteins and F-actin [39,40].
Previous studies have shown that the cytoskeleton network plays an important role in
the maturation and, possibly, in the replication process of SARS-CoV [27]. Communication
between the two cells in Fig. 4C-D suggests the occurrence of a thin (< 0.7 µm) strand of Factin containing tunneling nanotube (TNT). These intercellular membranous connections may
provide the transference of molecular information especially viruses [41]. Similarly, virus
cell surfing was shown on SARS-CoV-2 infection, which offers new insights into cell-to-cell
propagation and virus transmission.

Figure 1. Effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on host cell surface at 2 and 48 hpi. At 2hpi,
mock-infected cells exhibited smooth surfaces (A), while infected cells presented a discreet
increment in the number of SP with the MOIs of 0.01 (B) and 1(C). No viral particles were
observed on the surface of infected cells at 2hpi, even with the MOI of 1 (D). (E) Mockinfected cell surface at 48 h. (F) Virus adhesion to the cell surface and SP (arrowheads)
became more evident with the MOI of 0.1 (F). Bars: (A,C) 2 µm; (B) 10 µm; (D) 1µm; (E-F)
200 nm.
Figure 2. Morphology of cells surface and interior at 48 hpi. (A) With the MOI of 1, virus
attachment (arrowheads) was frequent. (B) Spikes of SARS-CoV-2 particles (arrows)
observed on the cell surface (cs) were discernible (MOI of 0.1). Viruses were observed laid
on cell surface and adhered (arrow) to SP (mv) of infected cells. They exhibited a size
between 70 and 85 nm (B-C) at MOIs of 0.01 and 0.1 respectively. Scraping of cells plasma
membrane (D) revealed a homogeneous distribution of organelles in mock-infected samples,
Infected cells exhibited coated pits vesicles of  100 nm (arrows) at perinuclear sites (E). A
polarized disposal at the infected cells cytosol (E) represented as a condensed area (ca) in the
infected ones (MOI of 0.1). (n): nucleus; Bars: (A, C, E) 100 nm; (B) 20 nm; (D) 2 µm.

Figure 3. Inspection of the condensed areas of cells at 48 hpi. (A) Profusion of vacuoles
(arrowheads) in cells infected with the MOI of 1. The possible route of the vacuoles was
indicated by arrows in (B). Scraped vacuoles had at least part of their content exposed.
Vacuoles in (C) and (D) presented doughnut-like particles (arrows). In (D), borderinng
vesicles (arrowheads) could be recognized next the vacuole membrane. Vacuoles shown in
(E) display doughnut-like particles (arrow) and immature viral-like particles (arrowhead) too.
MOIs: (B-D) 0.1; (E) 0.01; Bars: (A-B) 1 µm; (C-D) 200 nm.
Figure 4. Fate of the SARS-CoV-2 particles adhered to the cell surface at 48 hpi. (A-B)
Cell membrane ruffles about to wrap several viral particles (arrows). Viruses could also be
observed on the edge of membrane ruffles (arrowheads) (A) and phyllopodium-like
extensions (B). In (C) a viral particle could be seen adhered to the edge of the microvilli-like
structure (arrow) next to membrane ruffles (long arrow) surrounding SARS-CoV-2 particles
(arrowheads). (D) Communications between two infected cells are indicated with
arrowheads. One of the bridges between the cells was depicted in the rectangle. A higher
magnification of this area is shown in (E) and displays viral particles (arrows) on their
surface. Aggregates of SARS-CoV-2 particles (arrowheads) were also observed on the
surface of both cells. MOI = 0.1; Bars: (A-C, E) 200 nm; (D) 1 µm.
