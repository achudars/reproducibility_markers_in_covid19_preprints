Abstract

25

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome

26

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major public health issue. To screen for antiviral

27

drugs for COVID-19 treatment, we constructed a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) pseudovirus

28

system using an HIV-1-based lentiviral vector with a luciferase reporter gene to

29

screen 188 small potential antiviral compounds. Using this system, we identified nine

30

compounds, specifically, bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, that potently inhibited

31

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry, with EC50 values of 0.1–10 μM. Mechanistic studies

32

showed that these compounds, reported as calcium channel blockers (CCBs),

33

inhibited Ca2+-mediated membrane fusion and consequently suppressed coronavirus

34

entry. These candidate drugs showed broad-spectrum efficacy against the entry of

35

several coronavirus pseudotypes (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 [S-D614

36

and S-G614]) in different cell lines (293T, Calu-3, and A549). Antiviral tests using

37

native SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells confirmed that four of the drugs

38

(SC9/cepharanthine, SC161/hernandezine, SC171, and SC185/neferine) reduced

39

cytopathic effect and supernatant viral RNA load. Among them, cepharanthine

40

showed the strongest anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Collectively, this study offers new

41

lead compounds for coronavirus antiviral drug discovery.

Introduction

44

The novel coronavirus reported in 2019 (2019-nCoV), officially named severe acute

45

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a new type of coronavirus

46

belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus. It is a single-stranded RNA virus with a

47

genome of approximately 29 Kb and with a high pathogenicity and high infectivity.1-3

48

As of 8 December 2020, there were nearly 68 million confirmed cases of coronavirus

49

disease 2019 (COVID-19) globally, including more than 1.5 million confirmed deaths,

50

and the number of countries, areas, or territories with cases had reached 220.4

51

Although some countries have contained the pandemic, the number of confirmed

52

cases and deaths is expected to rise globally. Currently, no licensed specific antiviral

53

drugs are available to combat the infection. The development of effective viral

54

inhibitors and antibody-based therapeutics for COVID-19 is a high global priority.

55

The SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome encodes 29 structural and non-structural

56

proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) proteins,

57

and the ORF1a/b polyprotein.5 The S glycoprotein embedded as a trimer in the virus

58

envelope is a key structural protein that mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells.6

59

SARS-CoV-2 S protein comprises two functional subunits, of which S1 is responsible

60

for binding to host-cell receptors and S2 mediates the fusion of viral and cell

61

membranes. Binding of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) located in the S1 subunit

62

of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is

63

crucial for viral entry into cells.7-9 Blockade of SARS-CoV-2 entry has become an

64

attractive therapeutic strategy as it prevents the initiation of any steps towards viral

65

replication. To date, antibodies blocking S–ACE2 interaction have proven to be the

66

most effective for COVID-19 treatment.10-12 However, their high cost limits their

67

broad application. Thus, small molecule-based drugs targeting virus entry steps are

68

highly anticipated.

69

Efforts to find SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors have led to the identification of

70

several drug candidates. Lipopeptides targeting the HR1 domain in S2 significantly

71

inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry.13-15 Host proteases furin, TMPRSS2, and cathepsin B/L

72

help cleave S, thus facilitating the entry process. Inhibition of their activities by

73

small-molecule inhibitors such as camostat or E-64d blocks SARS-CoV-2

74

infection.16-18 Apilimod, an inhibitor of the lipid kinase PIKfyve, inhibits viral

75

infection by preventing the release of viral contents from endosomes.19 Although

76

some progress has been made toward SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors, there is still more

77

work to be done.

78

In this study, we successfully constructed a high-titer SARS-CoV-2 S

79

pseudovirus system using an HIV-1-based lentiviral vector with a luciferase reporter

80

gene for the screening of specific viral entry inhibitors. Based on this classic

81

pseudovirus model, a small potential antiviral compound library was screened. We

82

identified several compounds, especially, bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, that

83

potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry, with EC50 values of 0.1–10 μM.

84

Subsequently, we preliminarily explored the underlying mechanisms of the hit

85

compounds, and their antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in Vero

86

E6 cells with authentic virus. We identified compounds with effective antiviral

87

activity, thereby providing new lead compounds for coronavirus antiviral drug

88

discovery.

Screening of SARS-CoV-2 S-G614 entry inhibitors in 293T-ACE2 cells

92

The S protein variant D614G (a single change in the genetic code; D = aspartic acid,

93

G = glycine) carrying the amino acid mutation D614G has become the most prevalent

94

form in the global pandemic and has been associated with increased infectivity of

95

SARS-CoV-2.20-22 Using a luciferase-expressing pseudovirus encoding SARS-CoV-2

96

S (G614) protein, a library of 188 chemical compounds (Supplementary Table S1,

97

most were natural compounds) was screened in 293T-ACE2 cells to find novel

98

anti-SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors. A workflow chart of screening is shown in Fig. 1a.

99

293T-ACE2 cells were pretreated with 20 μM of each compound for 1 h and then, a

100

SARS-CoV-2 S-G614 pseudovirus (3.8 × 104 copies) mixture containing 20 μM of

101

each compound was added to the cells. A known entry inhibitor, E-64d (targeting host

102

cathepsin B/L), was used as a positive control and DMSO as a negative control.

103

Luciferase activity was measured to assess the inhibitory effect of the 188 compounds

104

on S-G614 pseudovirus entry 72 h post-infection. After a preliminary screening, 41

105

compounds associated with a relative infection rate <30% (Fig. 1b) were identified.

106

Half of these displayed cytotoxicity at 20 μM. We selected 19 compounds with low

107

cytotoxicity for further testing. The chemical structures of the 19 compounds are

108

shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. The selectivity index values in terms of cytotoxicity

109

were greater than 2, suggesting that they may be safe in vivo. As the S-G614

110

pseudovirus was generated in the envelope-defective HIV-1 backbone, vesicular

111

stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudovirus was used as a control to exclude compounds that

112

have anti-HIV activities. Through a filtering strategy, we identified nine compounds

(SC9, SC161, SC171, SC182, SC183, SC184, SC185, SC186, and SC187) that

114

specifically inhibited S-G614 pseudovirus entry. Except SC171, all these compounds

115

were bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. The EC50 values of the nine compounds

against S-G614 pseudovirus were below 10

119

Investigation of the treatment timing and antiviral efficacy in different cell lines

120

Next, we analyzed the relationship between the antiviral efficacy of the nine selected

121

compounds against S-G614 pseudovirus and the timing of treatment. We divided the

122

S-G614 pseudovirus entry into three stages: pretreatment, pseudovirus entry, and

123

pseudovirus post-entry. In total, nine experimental groups were set up for each

124

compound, including eight treatment groups (A–G) and a control group (Fig. 2a).

125

Importantly, pretreatment with each compound (group B in Fig. 2) significantly

126

inhibited S-G614 pseudovirus infection. In the pseudovirus entry stage (group C in

127

Fig. 2), the compounds exerted similar suppressive effects. However, in the

128

pseudovirus post-entry stage (group D in Fig. 2), none of the compounds showed any

129

inhibitory effect. These results indicated that all nine candidates blocked pseudovirus

130

infection by targeting host factors at the entry stage.

131

Hoffmann et al. highlight that cell lines mimicking important aspects of

132

respiratory epithelial cells should be used when analyzing the anti-SARS-CoV-2

133

activity.23 Hence, we determined their EC50 values against S-G614 pseudovirus in

134

Calu3, A549, and 293T-ACE2 cells (Fig. 3a–i). As shown in Fig. 3, the EC50 values of

135

SC9 (Fig. 3a), SC161 (Fig. 3b), SC171 (Fig. 3c), SC182 (Fig. 3d), and SC185 (Fig.

136

3g) were below 5 μM in all three cell lines. Unfortunately, the EC50 values of SC183

137

(Fig. 3e), SC184 (Fig. 3f), SC186 (Fig. 3h), and SC187 (Fig. 3i) did not reach the

138

threshold we had set and thus were excluded from subsequent experiments.

139
140

Inhibition of entry of pseudovirus bearing coronavirus S protein by the

141

candidate compounds

142

Considering that SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV all belong to the genus

143

Betacoronavirus, we next determined whether the remaining compounds have

144

broad-spectrum antiviral effects against these coronaviruses, using pseudovirus-based

145

inhibition assays. We constructed S-D614, S-SARS, and S-MERS pseudoviruses

146

using the same lentiviral system as S-G614, and then determined the EC50 values of

147

SC9 (cepharanthine, Fig. 4a), SC161 (hernandezine, Fig. 4b), SC171 (Fig. 4c), SC182

148

(tetrandrine, Fig. 4d), and SC185 (neferine, Fig. 4e) against these pseudoviruses in

149

293T cells expressing ACE2 or DPP4. Interestingly, SC9, SC161, SC171, and SC185

150

exhibited highly potent pan-inhibitory activity against coronavirus S-pseudotyped

151

viruses. The EC50 values of the five compounds are shown in Fig. 4f. As SARS-CoV

152

and SARS-CoV-2 have been reported to enter host cells via binding to ACE2, and

153

while DPP4 is critical for MERS-CoV entry, it could be ruled out that the five

154

compounds interfere with ACE2 to block pseudovirus entry.

Interaction between the target compounds and the SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain

157

Next, we used competitive ELISAs and thermal shift assays to determine whether

158

these five compounds interact with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain. SBP1, one of the

159

recombinant ACE2 polypeptides, exhibited a weak ability to inhibit the entry of

160

S-G614 pseudovirus and a weak RBD-binding ability (Fig. 5a, 5b), whereas the

161

interaction between SC9, SC161, SC171, or SC185 and RBD was negligible (Fig. 5b).

162

Thermal shift assay results showed that the ΔTM values of SC161, SC185, and SBP1

163

were 0 °C, 0.6 °C, and 1.3 °C, respectively (Fig. 5c–d), indicating that SC161 and

164

SC185 could not stabilize the RBD domain. Thus, the blockade of virus entry by these

165

candidate compounds is not related to interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD

166

domain.

167
168

Depletion of Ca2+ blocks the entry of SARS-CoV-2 S-G614 pseudovirus

169

Our data indicated that the above five compounds may target host cells to inhibit

170

SARS-CoV-2 entry. Therefore, we explored host factors via which these five

171

compounds inhibit virus entry in 293T-ACE2 cells. We examined whether these

172

compounds perturb cell fusion mediated by SARS-CoV-2 S protein, the initiation

173

process for virus entry. Compared to DMSO, SC9, SC161, SC182, and SC185 at 5

174

μM potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated membrane fusion of 293T cells, and

175

the cell-cell fusion rate in the SC171 treatment group was 40% (Fig. 6a, 6b). Previous

176

studies have shown that the calcium ion (Ca2+) plays a critical role in SARS-CoV or

177

MERS-CoV S-mediated fusion to host cell entry.24,25 Supplementation of the culture

178

medium with 2 mM CaCl2 enhanced S-G614 pseudovirus entry ability by 2-fold

179

compared with calcium-free medium (Fig. 6c). In contrast, the entry-blocking effect

180

of the compounds sharply decreased in calcium-depleted medium (Fig. 6d–e).

181

Moreover, treatment with 20 μM of BAPTA-AM, a calcium-chelating agent used to

182

deplete intracellular Ca2+, significantly decreased the entry capacity of S-G614

183

pseudovirus by 70% (Fig. 6f and 6g). More importantly, when cells were pretreated

184

with 20 μM BAPTA-AM in combination with one of the four compounds, among

185

which three bi-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids have been reported as calcium channel

186

blockers (CCBs),26-30 the EC50 values of these compounds against S-G614

187

pseudovirus decreased by more than 10-fold (Fig. 6h–i). Intracellular cholesterol

188

levels increase upon CCB treatment,31,32 and upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis

189

results in blockade of SARS-CoV-2 infection.33 Consistent herewith, intracellular

190

cholesterol levels increased in 293T-ACE2 cells pretreated with 5 μM SC9, SC161,

191

SC171, and SC185 (Fig. 6j). These data indicated that blockade of S-G614

192

pseudovirus entry by SC9, SC161, SC171, and SC185 mainly depends on calcium

homeostasis.

Discussion

213

Viral entry into host cells is one of the most critical steps in the life cycle of a virus.

214

Since blockade of the entry process is a promising therapeutic option for COVID-19,

215

research attention has been focused on the discovery of viral entry inhibitors. To block

216

the entry of SARS-CoV-2, the RBD–ACE2 interaction or viral fusion must be

217

abrogated. To date, a few entry inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 have been

218

reported.19,34-37 ACE2 is the key host receptor mediating SARS-CoV-2 entry. Host

219

factors including HMGB1 (an ACE2 expression regulator), calcium channel, and

220

vacuolar ATPases have also been reported to contribute to the infectivity of

221

SARS-CoV-2.33,38,39 Pharmacological inhibition of these crucial host factors provides

222

another potential therapeutic approach. Although entry SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor

223

development is very attractive, no candidates have progressed into clinical trials.

224

To address this need, we screened 188 compounds to identify SARS-CoV-2

225

(S-G614) entry inhibitors in 293T-ACE2 cells. Nineteen compounds, including 11

226

bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (SC9, SC161, SC180-188) and an analog of VE607

227

(SC171) were identified. VE607, previously reported as a SARS entry inhibitor with

228

an IC50 of 3 μM,40 did not block SARS-CoV-2 entry at 20 μM in our assay. Among the

229

19 hits, nine compounds (SC9, SC161, SC171, SC182–187) with relatively high

230

activity, low cytotoxicity, and good specificity were selected for subsequent analyses.

231

The efficacy of the nine compounds in different SARS-CoV-2 entry stages was

232

examined to clarify whether they interfere with S-ACE2 interaction by targeting S or

233

host factors. The compounds showed effective entry blockade only in the pretreatment

234

stage, and did not bind to the S RBD, indicating that they target host factors.

235

SARS-CoV-2 enters TMPRSS2-negative 293T-ACE2 cells via endocytosis, and

236

TMPRSS2 inhibitors do not block SARS-CoV-2 infection in this cell line.17 Besides

237

in 293T cells, our hits also inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in the TMPRSS2-positive

238

lung epithelial cell lines Calu-3 and A549, indicating that they do not target

239

TMPRSS2.

240

ACE2 is the common host receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, whereas

241

MERS-CoV infection relies on DPP4.41,42 Interestingly, our findings demonstrated

242

that bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (SC9/cepharanthine, SC161/hernandezine,

243

SC182/tetrandrine, and SC185/neferine) and the VE607 analog SC171 could potently

244

block infection by SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV pseudoviruses.

245

Therefore, our compounds do not target ACE2 or DPP4 and thus may target some

reduced infection by these viruses.24,25,43-45 We noted that the identified

251

bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids had been reported as CCBs26-29. CCBs, originally

252

used to treat cardiovascular diseases, are supposed to have a high potential to treat

253

SARS-CoV-2 infections46. In this study, the bis-benzylisoquinoline CCBs abolished

254

S–ACE2-mediated membrane fusion in 293T-ACE2 cells. Calcium-free medium or

255

intracellular Ca2+ chelation significantly diminished SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus

256

infection, suggesting that Ca2+ is required for SARS-CoV-2 entry. Upon pretreatment

257

with BAPTA-AM, the bis-benzylisoquinoline CCBs had >10-fold higher EC50 values

258

than those without BAPTA-AM pretreatment. These results corroborated that the

259

efficacy of these inhibitors depends on cellular calcium homeostasis. Additionally,

260

upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis has been revealed as a common mechanism

261

underlying viral resistance. Perturbation of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway with

262

the

263

bis-benzylisoquinoline CCBs upregulated intracellular cholesterol, which likely

contributes to infection inhibition.

In conclusion, we reported a set of bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids as

Compound screening

370

For pseudovirus-based inhibition assay, 188 compounds were screened via luciferase

371

activity. HEK 293T cells cultured in 96-well plate (2x104 cells/well) were incubated

372

with each compound (20 μM) for 1 hour and were infected with the same amount of

373

pseudovirus (3.8 × 104 copies in 50 μL). The cells were replaced to fresh DMEM

374

medium 8 h post-infection. Cells were lysed by 30 μl lysis buffer (Promega, Madison,

375

WI, USA) at 72 h post-infection to measure RLU with luciferase assay reagent

376

(Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the product description. All data were

377

performed at least three times and expressed as means ± standard deviations (SDs).

with compounds or DMSO as control for another 16h. Subsequently, the effector cells

385

were overlaid on target cells at a ratio of approximately one S-expressing cell to two

386

receptor-expressing cells with about 90% confluent. After a 4-hour coculture, images

387

of syncytia were captured with an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon eclipse Ti,

388

Melville, NY).

389

For quantification of cell-cell fusion, three fields were randomly selected in each

390

well to count the fused and unfused cells. The fused cells were at least twice as large

391

as the unfused cells, and the fluorescence intensity was weaker in fused cells since

392

GFP diffusion from one effector cell to target cells. The percentage of cell-cell fusion

393

was calculated as: [(number of the fused cells/number of the total cells) × 100%].

Differential scanning fluorimetry

409

Briefly, purified His-RBD was diluted to 200 μg/mL in PBS buffer containing Sypro

410

Orange 5× (ThermoFisher) in a 96-well white PCR plate. Compounds and ACE2

411

derived peptide SBP1 were added at a final concentration of 20 μM. All samples were

412

tested in triplicate with a Bio-Rad RT-PCR system. The samples were first

413

equilibrated at 25 °C for 3 min, then heated from 25 °C to 85 °C with a step of 1 °C

414

per 1 min, and the fluorescence signals were continuously collected using CFX

415

Maestro. Tm values were calculated as previously described48.

Functional analysis of Ca2+ in pseudovirus infectivity

418

293T-ACE2 cells were seeded in 96-well plate (2x104 cells/well) and incubated at

419

37 °C for 8h. For extracellular calcium depletion assays, cells were washed three

420

times using PBS with or without Ca2+. Calcium-free medium with or without 2 mM

421

calcium chloride and 5 μM compounds were added and incubated for 1h at 37°C.

422

Next, S-G614 pseudovirus was added to the cells for 8 h at 37°C. For intracellular

423

calcium depletion assays, cells were washed three times using PBS with or without

424

Ca2+, DMEM with BAPTA-AM (20 μM) or DMSO and gradient concentrations of

425

compounds were added and incubated for 2 h at 37°C. In the following, S-G614

Cellular cholesterol measurement

431

Cellular cholesterol was measured using the Cholesterol/Cholesterol Ester-Glo™

432

Assay (J3190, Promega, USA) according to the product’s description. In short, HEK

433

293T-ACE2 cells were assigned to 96-well plates (4x104 cells/well) and cultured for

434

24 hours at 37 °C with 5 μM compounds. DMSO was used as negative control. The

435

medium in the 96-well plate was removed and cells was washed twice with 200 µl

436

PBS. Then, 50 µl of cholesterol lysis solution was added, shaking the plate carefully

437

and incubating for 30 minutes at 37°C. Following, 50 µl of cholesterol detection

438

reagent was added with esterase or without esterase to all wells and the plate was
