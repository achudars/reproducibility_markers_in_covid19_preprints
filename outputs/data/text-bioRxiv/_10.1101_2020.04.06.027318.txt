Abstract
The literature reports several symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 in humans such as fever,
cough, fatigue, pneumonia, and headache. Furthermore, patients infected with
similar strains (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) suffered testis, liver, or thyroid damage.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as an entry point into cells for some
strains of coronavirus (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2). Our hypothesis was
that as ACE2 is essential to the SARS-CoV-2 virus invasion, then brain regions
where ACE2 is the most expressed are more likely to be disturbed by the infection.
Thus, the expression of other genes which are also over-expressed in those
damaged areas could be affected. We used mRNA expression levels data of genes
provided by the Allen Human Brain Atlas (ABA), and computed spatial correlations
with the LinkRbrain platform. Genes whose co-expression is spatially correlated to
that of ACE2 were then clustered into 16 groups, depending on the organ in which
they are the most expressed (as described by the NCBI genes database). The list of
organs where genes sharing local over-expression with the ACE2 gene are the most
expressed is astonishingly similar to the organs affected by Covid-19.

Introduction
The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (previously named 2019-nCoV) first emerged in
Wuhan, China, in late 2019. The disease then massively spread to Europe and other
continents. It causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and results in
significant morbidity and mortality.
The most widely reported symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 in humans are fever, cough,
fatigue, pneumonia, headache, hemoptysis, and dyspnea [1]. According to Huang et
al. [2], 63% of patients also suffered from lymphopenia. All 41 patients developed
pneumonia, with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute
respiratory distress syndrome (29%), RNAaemia (15%), acute cardiac injury (12%),
and secondary infection (10%). Furthermore, Chen et al. [3] included other
symptoms like confusion (9%) and diarrhea (2% of patients).
This new form of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) shares a very high similarity with the
severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory
syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), both in terms of RNA sequence and infection pathway
[4,5].
Moreover, growing evidence reveals that coronaviruses can also invade the central
nervous system (CNS), causing neurological symptoms. SARS-CoV infection is not
always restricted to the respiratory tract, as it has been reported in the brains of
patients and laboratory animals, where the brain stem was densely infected [6,7,8].
In 2002 and 2003, studies on SARS patients established the presence of SARS-CoV
particles in the brain, found in both neurons and gliocytes [9,10,11]. Based on
experimental studies on transgenic mice, Netland et al. and Li et al. [12,13]
concluded that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is likely to enter the brain through
olfactory nerves when administered intranasally. From there, viruses would promptly
spread other areas of the brain, including thalamus and the brain stem. It should be
noted that in mice infected with low inoculum doses of MERS-CoV, particles have
been exclusively found in the brain, but not in the lungs. This indicates that the CNS
infection was more decisive in the high mortality detected in infected mice [13].

It was reported that Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the main receptor
for SARS-CoV and MERS-Cov [12,14]. Recently, Baig et al. [15] demonstrated that
SARS-CoV-2 also uses ACE2 to target the central nervous system (CNS).
As ACE2 membrane proteins are the entry point for several strains of coronavirus
into human cells, we can assume that brain regions where the gene coding for ACE2
is expressed the most are also the regions that get the most infected by the virus.
Therefore, biological functions handled by other genes expressed in these regions
are likely to be affected by the infection.
To detect the most expressed genes in the regions where ACE2 is over expressed,
we used ABA [15], the only atlas covering mRNA expressions in the whole human
brain. All the mRNA expressions were integrated in LinkRbrain platform [17]. Based
on the over-expression of these mRNA, LinkRbrain performed topographical
correlations between the genes.
The aim of this study is to understand the potential impact of a SARS-CoV-2
infection in the brain. Hypotheses were drawn using the 20,789 mRNA expressions
of the genetic base of Allen Institute for Brain [15], and on spatial correlations
provided by the platform LinkRbrain [17], we identified the gene networks correlated
to ACE2. Finally, we discovered a strong relationship between these gene networks
and the symptoms registered in patients with coronavirus.

Results and discussion
In this study we explored the topographical network of genes that are overexpressed in the same regions as ACE2.
Our first objective was to topographically localize the mRNA expressions of ACE2.
Consequently, we explored the topographical network of genes with the highest
mRNA expressions in the same brain regions.
Thanks to the topographical distance calculation [17], LinkRbrain computed
correlations between regions where ACE2 has the highest expression levels, and the
coordinates of the over-expressions of each of the 20,788 other genes. From this
calculation, 100 genes in particular (from a model of 20,789 genes) showed a

significant increase in concentration of their mRNAs in the same regions where
ACE2 mRNA levels are the highest. NCBI and GenesCards platforms were used to
explore the other organs where these 100 genes are most expressed.
All these results can be observed interactively on LinkRbrain platform via the link
http://authorized2019.linkrbrain.org/query/#5937, or in the generated file referenced
as supplementary material (SM) 1. The 100 most correlated genes to ACE2 are
listed, and we found information on 75 genes about the organs where they are the
most expressed (see the list in SM2).
Analyzing the biological functions of these 75 genes allowed us to categorize them
into 16 groups (see Table 1). The first group concerns olfactory receptors (which can
be the entry point for the virus into the brain), but also genes that are most
expressed in the organs related to the symptoms reported in the literature, such as
the lymph nodes (for immunity), testis, spleen, liver, and intestines. Ding et al. [9]
reported that the coronavirus was detected in some organs like lungs or intestine,
However, no trace of this virus was detected in damaged organs such asSARS-CoVdamaged organs like oesophagus, thyroid, spleen, lymph node, bone marrow, testis,
ovary, uterus, or heart.
In summary, the list of organs where genes sharing local over-expression with the
ACE2 gene are the most expressed is astonishingly similar to that of the organs
affected by Covid-19.
Olfactory group:
By calculating correlations based on geometric distance, we identified three genes
coding for olfactory receptors (OR10H1, OR52B6, OR8S1). Netland et al. [12]
demonstrated that the brain of transgenic mice was a target organ for infection in
SARS-CoV (human angiotensin-2 converting enzyme). Besides, they presented the
olfactory bulb as the main entrance for the virus to reach the mouse brain. Our
results showing genes corresponding to olfactory receptors in this topographical
network are in agreement with these conclusions. Anosmia (loss of the ability to
detect smells) has recently been identified as a distinctive symptom of the SARSCov-2 infection by several observations from clinicians and patients.

Testis, prostate, and kidney:
Another group includes eighteen genes (see the complete list in table 1) which play
important roles in testes, kidneys, and the urinary tract, such as ALOX15B, LYZL6,
CCDC70, and COL4A3 [18,19,20].
In several studies [2,3,21], SARS-CoV2 patients with abnormal kidney function or
even kidney damage in addition to respiratory injuries have been mentioned, and the
corresponding mechanism is unknown.
Small intestine, appendix, colon, endometrium, and liver:
In addition to common respiratory symptoms such as cough and fever, some
patients may also experience other symptoms like diarrhea and liver damage
[22,23], further challenging the patient’s recovery. Based on our topographical
network of highly correlated mRNA expression with ACE2, we obtained a third
category of 10 genes, which are strongly involved in the digestive system, such as
BMF, C3AR1, FXYD3, and SLC7A3 (see the complete list in table 1) [24,25].
In the animal model, Yang et al. [26] presented the intestine as a target of SARSCoV invasion. Furthermore, Xiao et al. [27] showed a human gastrointestinal
infection of SARS-CoV-2.
Lymph node, spleen, and bone marrow:
One essential group detected within this topographical network is strongly linked to
the immune system. Indeed, we have distinguished seven genes such as KLRF1,
LILRB5, BKL and PHC3 (see the complete list in table 1), which are linked to the
ACE2 topographical network and expressed in lymph node, spleen, and bone
marrow [28,29,30,31].
In most SARS autopsies, both extensive necrosis of the spleen and atrophy of the
white pulp with severe lymphocyte depletion have been found [32, 33]. Furthermore,
several anomalies appeared in lymph nodes, such as atrophy [10] or necrotic
inflammation [34].
Thyroid gland:

From the 75 studied genes, we found four genes with a mRNA expression highly
geometrically correlated to the ACE2 mRNA expression that are expressed in the
thyroid [35,36].
In their work Gu & Korteweg [37] reported, in the thyroid glands of five SARS
autopsies, the destruction of epithelial cells with significant changes in the follicular
architecture.

Table 1: Genes co-expressed with ACE2 clustered by dominant biological
function
Conclusion
Genes co-expressed with ACE2 in the brain reflect the pathogenic and even
symptomatic picture of SARS-CoV-2 in an astonishing way. This could imply that
when SARS-CoV-2 is linked to ACE2, the topographical network of genes
overexpressed in the same regions are impacted.

Our results seem to be a serious hypothesis to explain the impact of SARS-CoV on
affected patient’s organs like oesophagus, thyroid, spleen, lymph node, bone
marrow, testis, ovary, uterus, and heart.

Material and methods
We computed spatial correlations between the brain areas where mRNA of ACE2 is
overexpressed, and the localized over expressions of 20,789 identified mRNA, using
the genetic database provided by the Allen Institute for Brain [15]. We used ABA
because it is the only atlas covering mRNA expressions in the whole human brain.
Transcriptomic map provided by Allen Human Brain Atlas:
ABA is a transcriptomic map of the whole human brain created by the Allen Institute
[15]. RNAs were extracted from each brain to implement 58,693 complementary
RNA hybridization probes, thus providing a RNA profile for the given subject.
The brain was then split into 946 samples, their coordinates being determined in
MNI-space. The complementary RNA probes were used to assess the concentration
of every fragment in each one of the samples, using RNA chips, thus providing the
mRNA expression level of 20,789 genes in 946 known points of the MNI-space.
Each one of the 946 is by the concentration value of 20,789.
To ensure the reproducibility of the data obtained, two different brains were ensured
[38].
These results have enabled a thorough study of the human genome expression at
the cortical and sub-cortical levels.
Analysis from LinkRbrain platform:
LinkRbrain (www.linkrbrain.org) is an open-access web platform for multi-scale
integration and visualization of knowledge on the brain. It integrates anatomical,
functional, and genetic knowledge, provided by the scientific community. Genetic
data were extracted from post-mortem studies, performed on brains from healthy
subjects by the Allen Institute.

LinkRbrain allows the comparison of new results (set of coordinates) with previously
published articles. Thus, the insertion of gene names in the platform allows their
visualization as a new set of coordinates, although it establishes correlations with
other genes whose level of expression is already identified at the same location.
The scoring algorithm described by Mesmoudi et al. [17] has been used to evaluate
spatial correlations between the level of expression of ACE2 and each of the 20,789
genes present in the database.
In order to calculate the correlation between the inserted gene linked to the SARSCoV, each set of coordinates, and the level of transcription relative to the 20,789
ABA genes present in LinkRbrain library, we used the platform internal topographical
distance already defined in [17] (See the detail of this distance in SM3).
Results viewing:
Thanks to the visualization tools available on LinkRbrain we obtained:


2D and 3D visualizations: these allow to envision the coordinates of the
different transcription levels of ACE2 mRNA.



Topographical proximity graph: this graph illustrates the 25 most closely
correlated mRNA expressions.



List of genes: based on the same scoring algorithm, LinkRbrain provides,
among 20,789 mRNA gene expressions, a list of mRNAs which share the
highest co-expression with the ACE2 mRNA.

Functional genes study:
We

used

NCBI

(https//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/)

[39]

and

GeneCards

(https://www.genecards.org/) to conduct a functional study and the organ target of
each considered gene. Indeed, we focused on the genes coding the mRNAs with the
highest concentration at the coordinates where the highest expressions of the ACE2
gene were found.
