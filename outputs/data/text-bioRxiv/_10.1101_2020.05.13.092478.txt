Abstract
The immediate call for translational research in the field of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic,
needs new and unexplored angles to support and contribute to this important worldwide health problem.
The aim of this study is to better understand the pathogenic mechanisms underlying COVID-19,
deciphering the carbohydrate-mediated interactions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We studied the
carbohydrate-binding receptors that could be important for viral entry and for immune-modulatory
responses, and we studied the interactions of the spike protein with the host lung microbiota. Exploring
solid-phase immunoassays, we evaluated the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and a
library of 12 different human carbohydrate-binding proteins (C-type lectins and Siglecs) involved in
binding, triggering and modulation of innate and adaptive immune-responses. We revealed a specific
binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the receptors DC-SIGN, MGL, Siglec-9 and Siglec-10 that are all
expressed on myeloid immune cells. In addition, because the lung microbiota can promote or modulate
viral infection, we studied the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and a library of
Streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharides, as well as other bacterial glyco-conjugates. We show
specific binding of the spike protein to different S. pneumoniae capsular polysaccharides (serotypes 19F
and 23F but not to serotype 14). Moreover we demonstrated a specific binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein to the lipopolysaccharide from the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one
of the leading cause of acute nosocomial infections and pneumonia. Interestingly, we identified
rhamnosylated epitopes as one of the discriminating structures in lung microbiota to bind SARS-CoV-2
spike protein. In conclusion, we revealed novel ACE2-independent carbohydrate-mediated interactions
with immune modulating lectins expressed on myeloid cells, as well as host lung microbiota glycoconjugates. Our results identified new molecular pathways using host lectins and signalling, that may
contribute to viral infection and subsequent immune exacerbation. Moreover we identified specific
rhamnosylated epitopes in lung microbiota to bind SARS-CoV-2, providing a hypothetical link between the
presence of specific lung microbiota and SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity.

Main Text
Viral infections constitute a serious public health and social problem worldwide, especially during
the recent COVID-19 pandemic caused by the betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 [1]. This virus utilizes
a glycosylated spike protein to bind to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and
TMPRSS2 [2,3]. During the initial and crucial infection steps, different carbohydrate-mediated
interactions are playing key roles at the host-pathogen interface, as shown for many viruses such
as HIV-1, Influenza viruses, Ebolavirus and SARS-CoV [4,5]. The viral proteins, often highly
glycosylated, can be recognized by different carbohydrate-binding proteins from the host,
triggering simultaneously immune-responses that can facilitate or inhibit viral entry or
dissemination [5]. In contrast to other pathogens and, with rare exceptions, viruses do not have
a glycosylation machinery and exploit the host intracellular glycosylation machinery, during the
viral intracellular replication. Due to the high evolutionary pressure, the glycosylation profiles of
various human-infecting viruses are very different from a classic host-glycosylated protein as
described for example for surface proteins of HIV-1, Ebolavirus, MERS, SARS-CoV and SIV [5,6].
The glycans on viral proteins are important for proper folding and for modulating accessibility to
host proteases and neutralizing antibodies [4]. Virus have exploited the host-glycosylation
machinery as camouflage strategy, hiding hypothetical immunogenic epitopes, as well as using
the host carbohydrate binding receptors as entry mechanisms as, for example, described for
Ebolavirus [7] and HIV-1 [8]. In addition, low affinity antibodies against some viral glycoproteins
have been reported to increase the viral infection [4]. In this scenario, the glycosylation profiles
of the spike glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 have been recently described [9,10,11]. Nglycosylation profile of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein expressed in human embryonic kidney 293
cells (HEK293) showed a combination of high mannoses and complex-type oligosaccharides,
including highly processed sialylated complex-type glycans and fucosylated glycans on different
glycosylation sites [9,10,11]. Interestingly, the N-glycosylation profile of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein shows also some difference compared with the SARS-CoV spike protein [11]. In addition,
O-linked glycan residues have been predicted [12] and described [10]. Apparently three adjacent
predicted O-linked glycans seem to be unique for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
The host-immune system has an evolutionary conserved class of carbohydrate-binding proteins
(lectins) able to sense these different glycan-epitopes, triggering innate responses in a
carbohydrate-dependent manner [13]. In this frame, the C-type lectins dendritic cell-specific
intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) and Langerin have been
described as well-known receptor on dendritic cells used by many viruses as entry mechanism
such as HIV-1 [14,15] and Ebolavirus [7]. The macrophage galactose binding lectin (MGL) and the
mannose receptor (MR) play a role in Influenza A virus infection [16], and sialic acid-binding
immunoglobulin-type lectins (Siglecs)-1 has been involved in HIV-1 trans infection and Ebolavirus
uptake [17,18].

In the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we investigated the interactions between the
glycosylated viral spike protein expressed in HEK293 cells and the host immune lectins via solidphase immunoassays. We screened a library of different human C-type lectins expressed on
myeloid cells such as the antigen-presenting cells like dendritic cells and macrophages (DC-SIGN,
Langerin, MGL, MR, Dectin-1 and the macrophage inducible calcium dependent lectin receptor
Mincle) or soluble (MBL), to bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein used as coating agent in ELISA
experiments. Figure 1 clearly shows binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human lectin
receptors DC-SIGN and MGL. The binding to DC-SIGN (but not to Langerin, MR and MBL) suggests
the interactions with specific fucosylated glycans present at N343 (core α1,6 fucose, or with LeX
type of structures) [9] or a particular conformation of the high-mannoses able to discriminate
between DC-SIGN and Langerin. The binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to MGL fits with the
presence of O-glycans at Thr323 or Ser325 on the spike protein [10], as the specificity of MGL has
been described for α or β Gal/GalNAc containing glyco-conjugates [19]. Surprisingly both MGL
and DC-SIGN are receptors found on tolerogenic macrophages/dendritic cells and their
carbohydrate-binding have been shown to hijack myeloid function keeping macrophages
immune-silent by the induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines and induction of T cell
apoptosis/exhaustion [20]. Although the oligomannosides-content of the spike protein has been
reported to be around 30% and Man5GlcNAc2 has been described to be the predominant
oligomannose-type glycan (N234 and N709) [9], we did not see binding to Langerin, MR and MBL
being bona fide lectins able to recognize mannosides. Despite the fact that the MR mannosebinding evolved separately from the other C-type lectins, MBL and MR have close similarity in
their mannose-binding profiles [21]. However, these human lectins were able to bind the positive
controls of our experiment, illustrating sensitivity of the assay for these lectins to bind their
carbohydrate structures (see Figure S1). The specific binding to DC-SIGN but not to Langerin has
been shown also for Marburg virus (MARV) [22], while viruses like HIV-1 binds both receptors
[15]. The fact that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds DC-SIGN but not Langerin nor MR or MBL, may
indicate that the high-mannoses are not accessible or that there is a preferential specificity for
the different fucosylated residues in the context of core fucosylation or terminal Lewis antigens
on the spike protein. This is line with our finding that both lectins do not bind to the spike protein
confirming poor accessibility of the spike protein high-mannoses to the immune system. As
expected, the lectin Mincle and Dectin-1, recognising mostly mycobacterial glycolipids and betaglucans respectively, were used as control and did not bind to the spike protein. As full figure
with all the positive controls is shown in Figure S1.

Figure 1: Binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human C-type lectins. Human C-type lectins
ELISA results: wells were coated with the viral spike protein and the binding to different C-type
lectins was evaluated in a calcium-containing buffer. The experiment has been performed three
times in duplicate with similar results, and data were normalized over signal from BSA-coated
wells. Error bars indicate standard deviations. OD: Optical density.
Since the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been described to express highly processed sialylated
complex-glycans at N165, N282, N801, N1074 and N1098 [10] we investigated whether these
glycans could be a signature for the sialic-acid binding lectins (Siglecs), a family of carbohydrate
receptors with immune-receptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) and known immune
inhibitory signaling properties [23]. Using our solid-phase immunoassay screening-system, a
library of different Siglecs (Siglec-3, Siglec-5, Siglec-7, Siglec-9 and Siglec-10) was explored for
binding activity to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Siglecs can be expressed on almost all immune cells,
including B and T cells, monocytes, eosinophils, and macrophages [23]. Although Siglecs are bona
fide Sialic-acids binding proteins, the literature is not consistent in assigning a specific sialylated
pattern to each Siglec. Notwithstanding this, human Siglec-3 and Siglec-10 have a prevalence to
interact with α2,6 linked sialic acids while Siglec-9 has a prevalence to interact with α2,3 linked
sialic acids (in the context, in most of the cases, of fucosylated or sulfated oligosaccharides).
Siglec-3 is highly expressed on macrophages and monocytes; Siglec-9 on monocytes, neutrophils,
conventional dendritic cells, NK and T cells; Siglec-10 on B cells, monocytes and eosinophils [24].
Different Siglecs have been implicated in T cell-mediated tolerance, alter B cell function and the
inhibitory Siglec-9 and Siglec-10 were upregulated on tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
contributing to exhaustion of tumor T cell responses [23].
As shown in Figure 2 we observed a specific interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with
Siglec-3, Siglec-9 and Siglec-10. Our results clearly suggest the presence of α2,6 and α2,3 linked
sialic acids on the viral spike protein, as well as the roles of immunomodulatory Siglecs during
SARS-CoV-2 infection, probably by altering and modulating the B-cells, neutrophil, eosinophils,

Figure 2: Binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to human Siglecs. Human Siglecs ELISA results:
wells were coated with the viral spike protein and the binding to different Siglces was evaluated.

These data illustrate that the heterogeneous glycan-repertoire expressed on the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein modulate the binding to different carbohydrate-binding receptors expressed on
host immune cells. In particular we speculate that the spike protein could target a repertoire of
immune inhibiting glycan binding receptors, such as DC-SIGN, MGL, Siglec-3, Siglec-9 and Siglec10. This also illustrates the enormous potential of SARS-CoV-2 to modulate the host immune
system on multiple levels.
We next explored a different angle of carbohydrate-mediated interactions of SARS-CoV-2
studying the interactions with lung microbiota components that may contribute to the disease
severity. Various viruses such as Influenza viruses, HIV-1, coronavirus OC43 and MERS, have been
described to interact with the host sialic-acids containing structures [25, 26] or to interact with
sulfated glycosaminoglycans, suggesting a carbohydrate-recognition activity for different viral
proteins [27]. In this context, recently the glycosaminoglycan heparin has been described to
interact with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein inducing conformation changes [28] and heparan
sulfate showed binding to the spike protein in a length dependent manner [29]. Starting from
these evidences, we chose to study the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with different
glyco-conjugates from the lung microbiota. The mechanism underlying the interactions between
the lung microbiota and viruses are currently not fully understood. It is known that the lung
resident microbiota modulates viral infections yielding beneficial outcomes, conferring

protection against viral infection, or harmful outcomes since virus can use the resident bacteria
to spread in the host by direct or indirect mechanisms [30,31,32,33]. Moreover, viruses can
perturb the integrity of the commensal microbiota (modified by viral infections, age, and smoke),
that in turn influences virus infectivity and morbidity [31]. Looking closely to all the bacteria
occupying the lung and upper-respiratory microbiota, they are covered by an extremely complex
library of glyco-conjugates mostly in the form of bacterial capsular-polysaccharides (CPS) and
lipopolysaccharides (LPS). This outer layer may contribute to the intimate interactions between
SARS-CoV-2 and the lung microbiota, and could help not only in understanding mechanistically
the viral entry, but also in supporting therapies and prognosis/diagnosis markers. From a clinical
perspective, few data suggest that the microbiota composition of the upper-respiratory tract
during acute respiratory syncytial virus infection differs from that of healthy controls [34]. During
the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other past viral outbreaks, respiratory viral infections are
associated with co-infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp). As recently reported, 50% of
COVID-19 patients who have died, also showed secondary bacterial infections, and fungal coinfections [35].
Thus, as a proof-of-concept, we designed a solid-phase immunoassay coating the plates with a
library of seven structurally different CPS from S. pneumoniae (the seven most abundant
serotypes worldwide as well as the ones included in pneumococcal conjugate-vaccines, PCV: Sp1,
Sp5, Sp06B, Sp14, Sp18C, Sp19F and Sp23F) and determined the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein as Fc-construct in our assay to quantify potential interactions. Surprisingly, when
analyzing the binding of the spike protein to the structurally different Sp CPS with our assay, we
observed a strong binding of the spike protein to Sp19F and Sp23F (Figure 3). The spike protein
was able to strongly recognize the CPS from Sp19F and Sp23F, while a somewhat weaker
interaction was observed with Sp18C and Sp06B. The CPS from Sp1 and Sp5 poorly bound SARSCoV-2 spike protein, while the CSP from Sp14 was not recognized. Looking for a structural
rationale, Sp19F, Sp23F and Sp18C, Sp06B have in common the presence of the following glycan
epitope: Glc (or Gal) 1,2 (1,3 or 1,4) linked to Rham (where Rha stands for Rhamnose, Glc for
Glucose and Gal for Galactose). Interestingly, Sp1, Sp5 and Sp14 have no rhamnose in their
structures. Rhamnose is a deoxy sugar not present in humans but highly abundant for example
in bacteria and mycobacteria. Bacterial rhamnosylated glyco-conjugates have evolutionary
conserved patterns that co-evolved with the host immune system, triggering for example, in
mammals a conserved and abundant class on naturally-acquired anti-rhamnose antibodies [36].
Despite the fact that we see differential binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to these
different capsules, we are sure that an equal amounts is coated in the plates: increase of the
concentrations of the different a CPS showed no improvement of the binding, and different
monoclonal antibodies against the reported CPS have been tested in these experimental
conditions showed equal coating of the different CPS.

Figure 3: Binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to different S. pneumoniae CPS. Wells were coated
with different S. pneumoniae CPS and the binding to the viral spike protein was evaluated
exploiting the mouse-Fc tag on the recombinant chimera spike protein. The experiment has been
performed three times in duplicate with similar results, and data were normalized over signal
from blocking buffer-coated wells. Error bars indicate standard deviations. OD: Optical density.
Following the observation of the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to different Sp CPS, we
aimed at studying also the interactions between other lung microbiota glyco-conjugates. We
designed another ELISA experiment to prove the spike protein binding to different LPS expressed
as surface antigens from different Gram-negative bacteria. A small library of different LPS
(Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella flexneri) was tested in an ELISA
assay against the spike protein. P. aeruginosa is a typical and widespread human opportunistic
pathogen, it can cause severe and often deadly lung infections, particularly in
immunocompromised patients, and increasingly resistant to a large number of antibiotics [37].
We chose to compare P. aeruginosa to two bacteria not interesting the lungs, namely S.
typhimurium [38] and S. flexneri [39], enteric pathogens both capable of invading and
disseminating the intestinal epithelium. The specific interaction between the spike protein and
the LPS from P. aeruginosa, when compared to the LPS from the gut-associated pathogens S.
typhimurium and S. flexneri, is indeed clear and showed in Figure 4. The same structural
considerations mentioned for the Sp CPS might be here done , that is the LPS from the intestinal
pathogens here tested (Salmonella and Shigella) do not express rhamnosylated-epitopes, while
the P. aeruginosa strain here analysed. In addition to be an opportunistic pathogen able to

occupy the lung ecosystem, P. aeruginosa expresses a LPS containing in its core-antigen the Glc
1,2-Rha epitope [40]. Also in this case, we proved with different parallel experiments (lectins
binding) that the three tested LPS are coating the ELISA wells in a similar way.
All together our results on bacterial glyco-conjugates suggest, in the context of SARS-CoV-2
infection, that some bacteria (and serotypes) in the lung, that harbor a rhamnosylated-epitopes,
could facilitate the binding of the virus to the epithelial cells and its subsequent dissemination.
These observations could trigger the design of new therapeutic approaches for the bacterial coinfections in COVID-19 patients. These unreported results indicate that lung microbiota CPS and
LPS, can play a role in accelerating the viral infection. In addition, due to the very high prevalence
of bacterial pneumonia in COVID-19 patients, these results could also help in evaluating the
impact of PCV vaccination on COVID-19 patients (as already suggested of other viral infections
[41]), as well as to identify specific Sp serotypes able to modulate the viral infection.

In conclusion, we identified different carbohydrate-mediated interactions of the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein. These interactions could impact and drive the infection severity and the
corresponding uncontrolled immune responses and inflammation processes [42].
Here we proved that the glycan-heterogeneity on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is the cause of
the multiple interactions with the host lectins. We showed that the spike protein is recognized
specifically by C-type lectins (DC-SIGN and MGL) and by different Siglecs (Siglec-3, Siglec-9 and
Siglec-10). Interestingly this connects to new, ACE2 independent, infection pathways, with the
hypothetical immune suppression of monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and B cells. The
binding to DC-SIGN, MGL, Siglec-9 and Siglec-10, indicates the presence and accessibility of the
immune system, to fucosylated and sialylated structures as well as the clear presence of Oglycans on the spike glycoprotein.
We also proved a totally unexplored behavior for viral proteins, showing the specific binding of
the SARS-CoV-2 to different glyco-conjugates expressed by the bacteria able to colonize the
lungs. These results may have implications to control and understand the bacterial co-infections,
to have a better understanding on the disease severity and to add risk factors in COVID-19
patients.
Together these data aim at adding different carbohydrate-mediated interactions in the complex
and holistic picture of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and its implications.

after max 15 min incubation at room temperature the reaction was stopped with 50 µL of H2SO4
(0.8 M) and the optical density (OD) was measured at 450 nm in an ELISA reader. The experiment
was performed three times with similar results, in duplicate and data were normalized over the
signal at 450 nm from the carbo-free blocking solution-containing wells. Polyacrylamide polymers
(PAA), functionalized with different glycans were purchased from Lectinity, MW approx. 20 KDa,

2 spike protein mice-Fc chimera (2019-nCoV Spike Protein RBD, Fc Tag, purchased from
Sinobiological) at 2 µg/mL in carbo-free buffer were added to the wells. After 1h at room
temperature, the wells were washed with PBS (2x150µL) and then 100 µL of anti-mouse
horseradish peroxidase (1 µg/mL, Goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP from JacksonImmuno) were added.
After 30 min at room temperature, the wells were washed with PBS (2x150µL). Finally, 100 µL of
substrate solution (3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine, TMB, in citric/acetate buffer, pH=4, and H2O2)
