Introduction

52

Since the end of last year, a new species of coronavirus, a contagious agent

53

capable of causing acute and severe respiratory infection and pneumonia through

54

airborne transmission, has rapidly caused global public concern and even popular

55

panic (1-3); the specific coronavirus was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health

56

Organization (WHO) (4). Updated data have reported more than 3 million infection

57

cases in the adult age group (5), with a death rate of approximately 2-10%, mostly in

58

the elderly population (6, 7). With its high pathogenicity and infectivity and its spread

59

in 200 countries and areas in a short time (8-10), not only multiple measures for

60

clinical treatment and cure and public isolation but also vaccine development are

61

urgently needed, and vaccine development could play a proactive role in controlling

62

this epidemic (11). However, as SARS-CoV-2 is a new viral agent with an unknown

63

infection mechanism and an unclear interaction with the immune system, vaccine

64

development should first answer some basic questions, including characterization of

65

antigenic

66

protective immunity elicited by the viral antigen via certain immune processes; and

67

whether the process of eliciting immunity to a viral antigen may be associated with

68

immunopathogenesis

69

antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) (12, 13). Based on these considerations,

70

the work here raised the following inferential idea: the fact that SARS-CoV-2 infects

71

cells through its spike (S) protein undergoing membrane binding with angiotensin

72

80

these N-specific antibodies should be considered with the S-specific antibodies to be

81

related to ADEs, which might exist in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals (12). Our work

82

describes a SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine developed based on the above deduction

83

and suggests a characterized immune response capable of defending against viral

84

attack in rhesus macaques immunized with this vaccine, while the possible ADEs

The virus proliferated in Vero cells (ATCC, Manassas, USA) and was purified by plaque
