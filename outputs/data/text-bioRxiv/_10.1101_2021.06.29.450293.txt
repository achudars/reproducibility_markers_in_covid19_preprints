Abstract (words 249)

43

Background: Antibodies and T cells cooperate to control virus infections. The definition of the

44

correlates of protection necessary to manage the COVID‐19 pandemic, require both immune

45

parameters but the complexity of traditional tests limits virus‐specific T cell measurements.

46
47

Methods: We test the sensitivity and performance of a simple and rapid SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike‐specific T

48

cell test based on stimulation of whole blood with peptides covering the SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike protein

49

followed by cytokine (IFN‐γ, IL‐2) measurement in different cohorts including BNT162b2 vaccinated

50

(n=112; 201 samples), convalescent asymptomatic (n=62; 62 samples) and symptomatic (n=68; 115

51

samples) COVID‐19 patients and SARS‐CoV‐1 convalescent individuals (n=12; 12 samples).

52
53

Results: The sensitivity of the rapid cytokine whole blood test equates traditional methods of T cell

54

analysis (ELISPOT, Activation Induced Markers). Utilizing this test we observed that Spike‐specific T

55

cells in vaccinated preferentially target the S2 region of Spike and that their mean magnitude is similar

56

between them and SARS‐CoV‐2 convalescents at 3 months after vaccine or virus priming respectively.

57

However, a wide heterogeneity of Spike‐specific T cell magnitude characterizes the individual

58

responses irrespective of the time of analysis. No correlation between neutralizing antibody levels

59

and Spike‐specific T cell magnitude were found.

60
61

Conclusions: Rapid measurement of cytokine production in whole blood after peptide activation

62

revealed a wide dynamic range of Spike‐specific T cell response after vaccination that cannot be

63

predicted from neutralizing antibody quantities. Both Spike‐specific humoral and cellular immunity

64

should be tested after vaccination to define the correlates of protection necessary to evaluate current

65

vaccine strategies.

Introduction

70

SARS coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), has

71

spread worldwide resulting in a global health and economic crisis that mass vaccinations are trying to

72

resolve. The host’s capacity to be protected from viral infection or from the development of severe

73

diseases requires a coordinated activation of different components of the immune system that

74

ultimately lead to the production of neutralizing and antigen binding antibodies and antiviral T cells.

75

Evidence that antibodies and T cells are required for protection have been generated in monkeys

76

challenged with SARS‐CoV‐2 (1). Similarly, antibodies and T cells are present in the majority of SARS‐

77

CoV‐2 infected individuals who control infection without severe symptoms (2‐6) and a robust CD8 T

78

cells response is associated with mild disease in oncological patients with humoral defects (7).

79
80

Recently developed SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines that protect more than 90% of the vaccinated individuals

81

from severe COVID‐19 can induce Spike‐specific antibodies and T cells (8, 9, 10). However, it is not

82

fully clear which level of antibodies and/or T cells is necessary to exert such protection and whether

83

differences do exist in antibody and T cell levels in vaccinated subjects. Efforts to define the protective

84

threshold of antibodies through mathematical modelling (11) have shed some light on this issue but

85

such work on T cell responses have so far been absent. While experimental data has shown that high

86

levels of neutralizing antibodies can be sufficient to protect from experimental infection, lower levels

87

require the presence of T cells (1). The level of neutralizing antibody titers are however extremely

88

heterogeneous after natural infection(12) and while most of the new SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines induce

89

high neutralizing antibody levels (13), their persistence over time needs to be evaluated. Instead,

90

virus‐specific T cells appear to persist for a long time after viral clearance (i.e. 17 years after SARS‐CoV‐

91

1 infection) and detection of SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific T cells in COVID‐19 patients with waning antibody

92

titers have been reported by different groups (5, 4, 14, 15). Furthermore, the protective role of Spike‐

93

specific T cells in vaccinated individuals has also been highlighted by recent analysis of the early profile

94

of Spike‐specific immunity (16).

95
96

We think that the correlates of protection induced by vaccinations should therefore be derived from

97

large prospective studies where both antibody and T cell levels are measured. However, while tests

98

for antibodies are routinely performed, the technical complexity of SARS‐CoV‐2 T cell measurements

99

have so far limited, with some exceptions (17), this analysis to few individuals characterized in few

100

specialized laboratories. This is due to the fact that T cells specific for a defined pathogen are a

101

minuscule fraction of the total T cells (often less than 1‐3%) present in blood and can be distinguished

102

mainly by complex functional assays that preserve the viability of the T cells during the assay. In

103

addition, methods that are technically simple and do not require complex laboratory equipment, like

104

ELISPOT, need to be performed in cells that have been purified from whole blood. This introduces

105

into the assay the lengthy and technically demanding processes of peripheral blood mononuclear cell

106

(PBMC) separation. Other assays that can directly measure the frequency and function of virus‐

107

specific T cells through expression of activation markers or cytokine production necessitate more

108

complex equipment (i.e. Flow cytometer) and highly specialized personnel which might not be

109

available in every routine diagnostic laboratory.

110
111

A possible rapid and simple alternative to these methods is the direct addition of stimulatory antigens

112

or peptides to whole blood that results in the secretion of cytokines (usually IFN‐γ) in plasma that is

113

subsequently quantified. This assay is routinely applied for the diagnosis of active Tuberculosis (18)

114

and it has also been shown to measure the presence of SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific T cells in asymptomatic

115

(5) and symptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 infected patients (19, 20). However, to our knowledge, its accuracy

116

and validation have not been properly analyzed over time in individuals who have been vaccinated

117

against SARS‐CoV‐2, and only responses immediately after vaccination have been tested (16).

118

Therefore, herein we utilized a range of cellular methods to measure SARS‐CoV‐2 T cell responses in

119

individuals vaccinated with the prefusion stabilized, full‐length SARS‐CoV‐2 S protein (BNT162b2) or

120

naturally infected with SARS‐CoV‐2. We demonstrated that detection and relative quantification of

121

Spike‐specific T cells in vaccinated individuals can be easily and rapidly achieved through simple

122

addition of Spike peptide pools to whole blood. Utilization of different peptide pools to stimulate

123

whole blood provides the flexibility to derive rapid information about the kinetics and magnitude of

124

Spike‐specific T cell responses induced by vaccination and compare it with the one present in

125

convalescent individuals.

Results

129

Rapid quantification of SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike‐specific T cells by direct peptide stimulation of whole

130

peripheral blood

131

We characterized the initial kinetics of Spike‐specific T cells induced by two doses of mRNA vaccine

132

(BNT162b2) over a 51 day period with different methods of antigen‐specific T cell analysis in fresh

133

blood and in cryopreserved PBMC. Whole blood of 6 healthy individuals was collected before (Day 0)

134

and 7, 10 and 20 days after the prime and 7, 10, 20 and 30 days after the boost dose. Whole fresh

135

blood (2‐6 hours from collection) was either directly stimulated with peptides for a cytokine release

136

assay (CRA) or processed to isolated PBMCs by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation (Figure 1A).

137

PBMCs were either used fresh in an IFN‐γ ELISPOT assay (Figure 1A) or cryopreserved for further

138

analysis. Fresh blood and fresh PBMCs were stimulated with the SpG peptide pool containing 55 15‐

139

mer peptides (Supplementary Table 1) covering Spike‐specific T cell epitopes that are immunogenic in

140

95% of SARS‐CoV‐2 infected individuals(5). Two negative controls consisting of the vehicle control

141

with identical DMSO concentration present in the SpG peptide pool and a peptide pool covering SARS‐

142

CoV‐2 nucleoprotein (NP; 41 peptides covering the C‐terminal half of nucleoprotein; Supplementary

143

Table 1) were used. Levels of IFN‐γ and IL‐2 were measured in the whole blood after 14‐18 hours of

144

incubation while the numbers of spots were also enumerated in the ELISPOT assay after overnight

145

incubation.

146
147

Figure 1B shows that the two different assays detected a predominant Spike‐specific response in all

148

the individuals and defined a matching profile of Spike‐specific T cell response after the prime and

149

boost vaccination doses. The number of IFN‐γ spots detected after boost vaccination matches that

150

observed in the phase 1/2 trial of individuals vaccinated with BNT162b2 (13) and with a similar

151

preparation consisting of the trimerized secreted version of the Spike receptor‐binding domain

152

(BNT162b1) (10), including a trial conducted in Chinese individuals vaccinated with BNT162b1 (21).

153

While stimulation with the NP‐specific peptide pool remained largely negative, the IFN‐γ quantities in

154

blood and the number of IFN‐γ spots showed identical peak responses that occurred 7‐10 days after

155

the first dose in individuals V4 and V5, and 7‐10 days after the second dose in individuals V1, V3 and

156

V6. There were however some minor discrepancies. CRA did not detect the boost of Spike‐specific T

157

cells induced by the second vaccine dose in subjects V4 and V5, perhaps in relation to the transient

158

lymphopenia induced by mRNA vaccination (13). IL‐2 cytokine measurement (Figure 1C) depicted an

159

equivalent pattern of Spike‐specific T cell response with that obtained through IFN‐γ release.

160

However, IL‐2 levels exceed the level of IFN‐γ in all the individuals 21 days after the first and second

161

dose of vaccination. Overall a very strong correlation between IL‐2 and IFN‐γ secretion with the

162

number of IFN‐γ spots was evident (Figure 1D), which allowed a precise estimation of the quantity of

163

IFN‐γ producing cells related to the quantity of cytokines detected in whole blood (Figure 1E).

164
165

Assessing the Spike‐specific T cell response directly from fresh whole blood yields comparable

166

results to classical T cell assays

167

Since T cell analysis is often performed in a single centralized laboratory using cryopreserved samples

168

collected at different sites, we also analyzed the Spike‐specific T cell response after vaccination using

169

ELISPOT and activation induced cellular markers (AIM) assay performed using cryopreserved samples

170

stimulated with SpG peptide pool and compared the results obtained with that from ELISPOT and CRA

171

performed using the corresponding fresh whole blood. As already shown (22), the quantity of Spike‐

172

specific spots detected by ELISPOT in cryopreserved PBMCs was reduced in comparison to the ones

173

detected in freshly isolated PBMCs (Supplementary Figure 1A), but the dynamics of the Spike‐specific

174

response remained consistent with fresh PBMCs (Supplementary Figure 1A) as also evidenced from

175

the high correlation between the ELISPOT results from the differently processed samples (Figure 2A;

176

Supplementary Figure 1B). The AIM assay in our hands was less precise in detecting the dynamic

177

expansion and contraction pattern of the Spike‐specific T cell response (Supplementary Figure 1C and

178

D) likely due to the negative impact of cryopreserving PBMCs. Nevertheless, the AIM ability to

179

differentiate between CD4 and CD8 T cell response represent an asset that should not be discounted.

180
181

We then assessed whether whole blood CRA results could reflect the results obtained using other

182

assays (Figure 2A and B). We correlated the results obtained in all the different assays of Spike‐specific

183

T cells in cryopreserved and fresh PBMC samples with the results of the whole blood CRA. Cytokines

184

in whole blood remained well correlated with ELISPOT assays that used cryopreserved or fresh PBMC

185

samples, while its correlation with AIM assay results were generally weaker (Figure 2A and B). These

186

results indicate that the CRA which utilizes freshly collected whole blood is a robust method that can

187

reliably quantify Spike‐specific T cell responses with results that are comparable to well‐established

188

assays used to analyze T cell responses.

189
190

Determining fine specificity of Spike‐specific T cell responses through whole blood CRA

191

We next tested whether the whole blood CRA can be used to rapidly define T cell immunogenic regions

192

of the whole Spike protein in vaccinated individuals. 15‐mer peptides with an overlap of 10 AA

193

covering the whole 1273 AA long Spike protein were organized in distinct pools of ~40 peptides that

194

cover the following 7 Spike regions: Pool 1 (1‐180), Pool 2 (171‐345), Pool 3 (336‐510), Pool 4 (501‐

195

705), Pool 5 (696‐895), Pool 6 (886‐1085), Pool 7 (1076‐1273). A schematic representation of the

196

localization of peptide pools 1 to 7 in relation to the S1 (N‐terminal), RBD and S2 (C‐terminal) regions

197

of Spike is displayed in Figure 3A. These different Spike peptide pools were used in the whole blood

198

CRA and ELISPOT with freshly isolated PBMCs. The results of these different assays performed at the

199

indicated time points is first shown in two representative vaccine recipients (Figure 3B) while the

200

results obtained in all the 6 different individuals are represented as a heat map displayed in Figure 3C.

201

The three different measurements (IFN‐γ and IL‐2 CRA, and IFN‐γ ELISPOT) provided very similar

202

information in relation to the T cell response induced by BNT162b2 in healthy individuals. Even though

203

some differences can be noted, like in individual V3, in whom the dominant IFN‐γ response (CRA and

204

ELISPOT) was induced by Pool 3 while Pool 7 induced the dominant IL‐2 response, overall all the assays

205

were largely equivalent. Consistent across the three different measurements, Spike‐specific T cells

206

preferentially targeted the S2 chain of Spike (covered by Pools 5, 6, and 7 spanning Spike 700‐1273

207

AA) with responses in all the 6 individuals tested at different time points. Whole blood CRA and

208

ELISPOT also showed that the region 501‐705 AA contained in Pool 4 is the least immunogenic with

209

only 1 out of the 6 vaccine recipients displaying a response at different time points (Figure 3B and C).

210

Interestingly, analysis of individuals who recovered from SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (23) and in mRNA

211

vaccine recipients (24) showed a similar reduced frequency of response in the Spike region 500‐700

212

AA for CD4 T cells assayed through AIM detection. Taken together, these data show that direct

213

analysis of cytokines secreted in whole blood pulsed with different peptides constitute a reliable

214

method to gauge the presence and magnitude of functional T cells specific for epitopes covered by

215

the utilized peptides.

216
217

Total Spike‐specific T cell response is accurately represented by the T cells specific for the SpG

218

peptide pool

219

While whole blood CRA using the 7 overlapping peptide pools of the Spike protein could give us

220

information on the immunogenicity of the different regions of Spike and the total Spike‐specific T cell

221

response, the feasibility of assessing the response in larger numbers of individuals requires a more

222

streamlined approach. As such, we analyzed the relation between the total Spike‐specific T cell

223

response and the response against our selected SpG peptide pool. A schematic representation of the

224

localization of the peptides contained in the SpG peptide pool is displayed in Figure 4A. By correlating

225

the results obtained from 3 different assays (IFN‐γ and IL‐2 CRA, and IFN‐γ ELISPOT) where both the

226

total Spike protein and SpG peptide pool ‐specific T cell response was determined in the same sample

227

through stimulation with the corresponding peptide pools, we observed a strong positive linear

228

relationship indicating that the T cell response against the SpG peptide pool is highly representative

229

of the total Spike T cell response (Figure 4B). In fact, the SpG peptide pool‐specific T cell response

230

constitutes ~60‐80% of the total T cell response against the entire Spike protein (Figure 4C). Hence,

231

we proceeded to analyze the Spike‐specific T cell response in a larger cohort of BNT162b2 vaccinated

232

individuals and in individuals who have recovered from SARS‐CoV‐2 and SARS‐CoV‐1 infection using

233

the whole blood CRA with SpG peptide pool as a stimulant.

234
235

T cell response to Spike after vaccination or after natural infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 or SARS‐CoV‐1

236

A total of 112 BNT162b2 vaccinated individuals (201 samples), 62 and 68 individuals who recovered

237

from symptomatic (115 samples) and asymptomatic (62 samples) SARS‐CoV‐2 infection respectively,

238

and 12 individuals who recovered from SARS‐CoV‐1 infection 18 years ago (12 samples) were studied

239

longitudinally using the whole blood CRA with SpG peptide pool and measuring both IFN‐γ and IL‐2.

240
241

Firstly, we analyzed samples collected ≥3 months post boost vaccination (3 months) or SARS‐CoV‐2

242

infection clearance (3‐12 months) to understand if the whole blood CRA remains reliable in quantifying

243

the Spike‐specific T cell responses at later time points beyond that tracked in Figure 1 (Supplementary

244

Figure 3). Linear regression analysis of IFN‐γ and IL‐2 secretion from whole blood CRA and the

245

corresponding frequency of IFN‐γ spots in ELISPOT showed a good correlation across all subject groups

246

at time points 3 months and beyond (Supplementary Figure 3). This indicates that whole blood CRA

247

can quantify Spike‐specific T cell responses accurately in vaccinated and infected individuals within 3

248

and 12 months after boost vaccination or infection resolution respectively.

249
250

Analyzing all the time points studied, we observed that vaccinated individuals exhibited a pronounced

251

Spike‐specific T cell response at the earliest analyzed timepoint (~14 days) after the boost vaccination

252

dose which gradually declined and started to stabilize above the positivity threshold at 2‐3 months

253

(34/35 IFN‐γ positive at 3 months), consistent with an initial T cell clonal expansion induced by

254

vaccination and subsequent normalization (Figure 5A; Supplementary Figure 4). Similar kinetics were

255

observed in natural SARS‐CoV‐2 infection where Spike‐specific T cell responses were high around 1

256

month after infection clearance which gradually declined and stabilized above the positivity threshold

257

(Asymp.: 23/27 positive; Symp.: 46/55 IFN‐γ positive at 9‐12 months) regardless of the symptomatic

258

presentation during infection (Figure 5A; Supplementary Figure 4). Even in individuals who recovered

259

from SARS‐CoV‐1 infection 17 years ago, T cells specific for SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike protein also remained

260

detectable (8/12 IFN‐γ positive) similar to the nucleoprotein‐specific T cells described previously (25),

261

despite the low AA conservation of the SpG peptides between the two viruses (Figure 5A). Clearly,

262

whether T cells induced by vaccines will be maintained as the ones induced by natural infection

263

beyond the 3 months period will have to be analyzed.

264
265

We also assessed whether differences in the magnitude of the response were present between the

266

different groups. We compared the Spike‐specific T cell response detected at similar time points 2‐3

267

months post vaccine boost or viral clearance. Unlike reports of higher quantities of neutralizing

268

antibodies in vaccinees (13), individuals with symptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and vaccinees mount

269

an equivalent magnitude of Spike‐specific T cell response (both IFN‐γ and IL‐2 secretion) while higher

270

levels of IFN‐γ secretion were only detected in individuals who had an asymptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2

271

infection (Figure 5B). The latter observation is in line with previous analysis of asymptomatic and

272

symptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 infected individuals within 1 month of viral clearance where the former

273

showed increased cytokine production with comparable frequencies of virus‐specific T cells (5).

274

Subtle qualitative differences in the Spike‐specific T cell response were also observed in the different

275

groups. Upon vaccination, Spike peptide induced IFN‐γ and IL‐2 secretion was comparable, but

276

gradually diverged with time leading to higher levels of detectable IL‐2 2‐3 months post boost

277

vaccination (Figure 5C). Symptomatic individuals also produced significantly more IL‐2 than IFN‐γ >6

278

months after viral clearance while this difference was less pronounced in asymptomatic individuals

279

even at the latest time points tested (9‐12 months post viral clearance) which did not reach statistical

280

significance (Figure 5C). In individuals with previous SARS‐CoV‐1 infection, whole blood CRA also

281

detected higher IL‐2 secreting Spike‐specific T cell responses 18 years after resolution of infection

282

(Figure 5A). Hence, quantifying IL‐2 secretion provides better sensitivity over IFN‐γ in the detection

283

of individuals with a long‐term Spike‐specific memory T cell response.

284
285

Whole blood CRA detects the wide dynamic range and heterogeneous function of Spike‐specific T

286

cell responses in vaccinated individuals

287

In addition to evaluating the kinetics, quantitative and qualitative differences in the T cell response,

288

the whole blood CRA also detected a wide range of Spike‐specific T cell response in vaccinated

289

individuals. Figure 6A shows the paired longitudinal samples of 27 vaccinees at ~14 and 90 days post

290

boost vaccination. Secreted IFN‐γ and IL‐2 amounts in whole blood CRA differed between the two

291

time points and among individuals. Interestingly, the quantity of cytokines detected two weeks after

292

boost dose vaccination does not always predict the level of Spike‐specific T cell response measurable

293

at day 90. Some individuals exhibit >20‐fold reduction at day 90 after boost vaccination, while in

294

others, particularly for IL‐2, the level was more stable (Figure 6). Indeed some individuals have a more

Spike‐specific T cell responses do not correlate with neutralizing antibody quantities

Lastly, since the quantification of serum neutralizing antibodies is the mainstay of SARS‐CoV‐2

quantity of neutralizing antibodies and Spike‐specific T cell responses.

symptomatic COVID‐19 patients quantified through whole blood CRA (both IFN‐γ and IL‐2) with the

serum neutralizing antibody quantities assessed through RBD‐hACE2 binding inhibition assay (Figure

305

306

previously in convalescent {PhD:2021bm} and in vaccinated individuals (26), serum neutralizing

307

antibody quantities cannot predict the corresponding Spike‐specific T cell responses in an individual

308

and this further stresses how T cell response information from the whole blood CRA complements

309

existing antibody assessments.

Discussion

314

The complexity of virus‐specific T cell characterization relegates their analysis to studies performed in

315

selected laboratories accustomed with the complex methods of T cell analysis. The rapidity, simplicity

316

and accuracy of the cytokine release assay (CRA) in whole blood can allow a routine measurement of

317

SARS‐CoV‐2 T cells in large populations and thus help in understanding the role of antiviral T cells

318

during the current COVID‐19 pandemic. It is important to note that cytokine release in the stimulated

319

whole blood does not detect the mere presence of T cells but also their functionality. This is an

320

important feature of the assay that differentiates the CRA (and other assays like ELISPOT and AIM)

321

from the recently developed test (T‐Detect COVID, Adaptive Biotechnologies), which uses next

322

generation sequencing of T cell receptors (TCR) to determine the presence/absence of cellular

323

immunity to SARS‐CoV‐2 (27). We think that the ability to measure the wide dynamic range of

324

functional Spike‐specific T cells and not only their presence will be an important asset that will more

325

precisely evaluate the protective ability of T cells after infection or vaccination.

326
327

In this work, by sequentially testing vaccinated and SARS‐CoV‐2 convalescent individuals, we show

328

that IL‐2 and IFN‐γ quantification in whole blood measured Spike‐specific T cell response with an

329

accuracy equivalent to ELISPOT assays performed in freshly purified PBMC. Minor discrepancies

330

between the magnitudes of T cells were detected only at early time points when CRA was able to

331

detect a signal in the absence of ELISPOT results. Furthermore, analysis at 2 and 3 months after

332

vaccination showed, on average, a better sensitivity of IL‐2 over IFN‐γ in the detection of subjects with

333

Spike‐specific T cell responses. The superior ability of IL‐2 to detect long‐term memory Spike‐specific

334

T cells was also supported by the analysis of SARS‐CoV‐2 convalescent individuals 12 months after

335

infection and also 17 years after infection in the case of SARS‐CoV‐1 infected individuals. Interestingly,

336

this difference in sensitivity is less pronounced in convalescent COVID‐19 patients with asymptomatic

337

infection. Though speculative at the moment, this lack of difference between IFN‐γ and IL‐2 secretion

338

could reflect a better functionality of Spike‐specific T cell response and hence plausibly contribute to

339

the benign disease trajectory in these individuals.

340
341

The ability of CRA to measure the dynamic range of Spike‐specific T cell responses allowed us to study

342

a wide group of vaccinated and COVID‐19 convalescent individuals. We observed that despite the

343

homogeneous cohort of vaccinated adults (21‐60 years of age, healthy and SARS‐CoV‐2 naive

344

individuals), the Spike‐specific T cell response was quantitatively different immediately after both the

345

prime and vaccination doses (~14 days after vaccination) and after 3 months, similar to what was

346

detected in a more heterogeneous population of COVID‐19 convalescent individuals with mild or

11

347

asymptomatic disease. In the vaccinated cohort, we first observed that half of the vaccinated

348

individuals showed a peak of their Spike‐specific T cell response ~14 days after the prime dose while

349

half reached their peak response after the boost dose. These data were derived from a very limited

350

sample size since we studied only 6 individuals at multiple time points after vaccination. However,

351

the inability of the second vaccine dose to boost Spike‐specific T (and antibody) responses in some

352

individuals has been observed so far only after vaccination of SARS‐CoV‐2 convalescents and not, like

353

in our study, in SARS‐CoV‐2 naïve. A possibility is that the pre‐existing Spike‐specific T cells primed by

354

other coronaviruses could have influenced this different kinetic.

355
356

The analysis of a much larger cohort of vaccinated individuals (n=112) studied with less frequent

357

sampling up to 3 months upon completion of vaccination further confirmed the heterogeneity of the

358

magnitude of the induced Spike‐specific cellular response. The quantity and the kinetics of decline of

359

the Spike‐specific cellular responses diverged among the vaccinated individuals with CRA IFN‐γ and IL‐

360

2 concentrations that spans from 10‐500pg/ml and 40‐500pg/ml respectively. Interestingly, some

361

individuals have a constant cytokine secretion level over the observation period while in others, the

362

cytokines quantity drops precipitously. In addition, the longitudinal quantification of two cytokines

363

further increased the heterogeneity of the vaccine‐induced immunity in different individuals as IFN‐γ

364

and IL‐2 quantities did not decrease in parallel in all the individuals. Some vaccinated individuals

365

displayed a stable IL‐2 production associated with a profound decrease of IFN‐γ, while others showed

366

exactly the opposite. Whether these differences can be attributed to the presence of different

367

populations of effector/memory T cells or different ratios of CD4 and CD8 T cells and whether such

368

differences have an impact on protection will need to be analyzed in a large clinical study. In addition,

369

it will be important to continue monitoring the Spike‐specific T cell response beyond the 3 months

370

observation period to understand whether the Spike‐specific T cell response induced by vaccines will

371

behave like the one observed after natural infection. Importantly, the rapid cytokine assay was able

372

to detect Spike‐specific T cells in ~84% of SARS‐CoV‐2 individuals 1 year after infection and also in 8

373

out of 12 SARS‐CoV‐1 patients 18 years after infection.

374
375

Another important observation that further supports the concept of marked heterogeneity of the

376

immune response induced by the BNT162b2 vaccination was the lack of correlation between the

377

magnitude of humoral and cellular immunity. The substantial independence of different components

378

of the immune system after the initial induction phase has been demonstrated in COVID‐19

379

convalescents (28, 29) and can be explained by recent data showing that neutralizing antibodies can

380

be produced without follicular T cell help (30). The CRA also reveals a similar profile both in COVID‐

12

381

19 convalescent and vaccinated individuals where an independence of the neutralizing antibody titers

382

and the magnitude of cytokines secreted was detected. COVID‐19 convalescents were studied over 1

383

year after infection and displayed different levels of neutralizing antibodies, while vaccinated

384

individuals mostly displayed a consistently high neutralizing antibody titers with little variations

385

among the tested individuals 3 months after vaccination. In other studies, antibody persistence was

386

still observed up to 6 months post mRNA vaccination at the time of writing(31). We do not know

387

whether antibodies induced by vaccination will show a similar rate of decline as observed after natural

388

infection beyond the 6 months follow up till date, which can make the analysis of cellular immunity

389

even more important. Our data at the moment show that three months after vaccination, the levels

390

of neutralizing antibodies cannot be used as a surrogate of Spike‐specific cellular immunity induced

391

by vaccination.

392
393

This quantitative heterogeneity was however not mirrored by the regions of Spike protein targeted by

394

T cells induced by BNT162b2 vaccination. We observed a substantial similarity of immunodominance

395

among the different vaccinated individuals, with large part of the T cell response directed towards the

396

Spike 2 chain and with an almost complete lack of T cell determinants within the N terminal region of

397

S1 (region 501‐705AA). A reduced presence of T cell epitopes in this region was already observed in

398

SARS‐CoV‐2 convalescents (23). It will be interesting to test whether this documented profile of Spike‐

399

T cell specificity will also occur in individuals vaccinated with different products where subtle

400

differences of codon usage, signal peptide and amino acid modifications (pre‐fusion conformation

401

stabilization and furin cleavage site mutations) were introduced(32) (33‐35).

402
403

In conclusion, we show here that the rapid measurement of cytokine production in whole blood after

404

peptide specific activation is a quick and simple assay that can reliably detect the wide dynamic range

405

of functionally heterogeneous Spike‐specific T cell response induced after vaccination or infection in

406

different individuals. Even though T cells cannot prevent infection in the absence of antibodies, their

407

pivotal role in the protection from disease severity has been shown in natural infection of normal (2)

408

(3), oncological patients (7) and in vaccinated individuals (16). As such, since the quantity of Spike‐

409

specific T cells cannot be predicted by the simple measurement of antibodies, this higher throughput

410

and simple assay represents a feasible approach to implement in routine testing to complement

411

existing antibody measurements and thus help to define the correlates of protection necessary for the

412

design of current vaccine strategies.

Subject details

418

Individuals who have recovered from SARS‐CoV‐2 infection (Asymptomatic: n=62; Symptomatic:

419

n=68), vaccinated with BNT162b2 (n=112) or had SARS‐CoV‐1 infection 17 years ago (n=12) were

420

enrolled in this work as part of the PROTECT study (National Healthcare Group Domain Specific Review

421

Board, NHG DSRB ref. 2012/00917), Healthcare Worker Vaccination study (SingHealth Centralised

422

Institutional Review Board, CIRB ref. 2021/2014), Novel Pathogens study (CIRB ref. 2018/3045) and

423

SARS Recall study (NHG DSRB ref. 2020/00091). All participants provided written informed consent.

424

Vaccinated individuals were between 21‐60 years of age, healthy and SARS‐CoV‐2 infection naïve.

425

Whole blood and serum samples were collected at the indicated intervals for serological and T cell

426

response analysis.

428

Peptides

429

15‐mer peptides that are overlapping by 10 amino acids (AA) spanning the entire SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike

430

protein (GISAID EPI_ISL_410713) were synthesized (Genscript) and pooled into 7 pools of

431

approximately 40 peptides in each pool (Supplementary Table 1). 55 Spike peptides covering the

432

immunogenic regions of the SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike protein that represents 40.5% of the whole Spike

433

protein forms the SpG peptide pool as described previously (5).

434
435

Cytokine release assay (CRA) from whole peripheral blood stimulated with SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike peptide

436

pools

437

320 μl of whole blood drawn on the same day were mixed with 80 μl RPMI and stimulated with the

438

indicated SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike peptide pools (Supplementary Table 1) at 2 μg/ml or with DMSO as a

439

control. After 16 hours of culture, the culture supernatant (plasma) was collected and stored at −80ºC.

440

Cytokine concentrations in the plasma were quantified using an Ella machine with microfluidic

441

multiplex cartridges measuring IFN‐γ and IL‐2 following the manufacturer’s instructions

442

(ProteinSimple). The level of cytokines present in the plasma of DMSO controls was subtracted from

443

the corresponding peptide pool stimulated samples. The positivity threshold was set at 10x times the

444

lower limit of quantification of each cytokine (IFN‐γ = 1.7pg/ml; IL‐2 = 5.4pg/ml) after DMSO

445

background subtraction.

448

Peripheral blood of all individuals was collected in heparin containing tubes and peripheral blood

449

mononuclear cells from all collected blood samples were isolated by Ficoll‐Paque density gradient

450

centrifugation.

451
452

SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike‐specific T cell quantification

453

The frequency of SARS‐CoV‐2 Spike‐specific T cells was quantified as described previously (5).Briefly,

454

freshly isolated or cryopreserved PBMC (as indicated) were stimulated with SpG peptide pool in an

455

IFN‐γ ELISPOT assay. ELISPOT plates (Millipore) were coated with human IFN‐γ antibody overnight at

456

4°C. 400,000 PBMC were seeded per well and stimulated for 18h with the SpG peptide pool at 2 μg/ml.

457

The plates were then incubated with human biotinylated IFN‐γ detection antibody, followed by

458

Streptavidin‐AP and developed using the KPL BCIP/NBT Phosphatase Substrate. To quantify positive

459

peptide‐specific responses, 2x mean spots of the unstimulated wells were subtracted from the

460

peptide‐stimulated wells, and the results expressed as spot forming cells (SFC)/106 PBMC. Results

461

were excluded if negative control wells had >30 SFC/106 PBMC or if positive control wells

462

(PMA/Ionomycin) were negative.

464

RBD‐hACE2 binding inhibition assay

465

Antibodies inhibiting virus binding to host cell was measured using a commercial RBD‐human

466

angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) binding inhibition assay called cPASS™ (GenScript). As per

467

manufacturer’s instructions, serum was diluted 1:10 in the kit sample buffer and mixed 1:1 with HRP‐

468

conjugated RBD and incubated for 30 mins at 37°C. RBD‐antibody mixtures were then transferred and

469

incubated for 15 mins at 37°C in enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates coated with

470

recombinant hACE2 receptor. Following incubation, plates were washed with the kit wash solution,

471

incubated with TMB substrate for 15 mins and reaction stopped with stop solution. Absorbance was

472

measured at OD450 nm. Percent inhibition of RBD‐hACE2 binding was computed using the following

473

equation: % inhibition=(1‐[(OD of serum+RBD)/(OD of negative control+RBD)])×100. As described by

474

the cPASS™ kit, a cutoff of 20% and above was used to determine positive RBD‐hACE2 inhibition.

475
476

Activation induced cell marker assay

477

Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed and stimulated for 24 hr at 37⁰C with the SpG peptide pool

478

(2µg/ml) in AIM‐V media supplemented with 2% AB serum. Cells were then stained with the Fixable

479

Near‐IR Live/Dead fixable cell stain kit (Invitrogen) followed with surface markers as previously

480

described (16): anti‐CD3, anti‐CD4, anti‐CD8, anti‐CD69, anti‐CD134 (OX40) and anti‐CD137 (4‐1BB).

blood from vaccinated individuals. A) Comparative schematic representation of the workflow for the

596

direct peptide stimulation of whole peripheral blood and the subsequent detection of cytokine

597

secretion, and a standard IFN‐γ ELISPOT assay. B) 6 healthy individuals were vaccinated with 2 doses

598

of BNT162b2 according to the recommended schedule (21 days apart) and whole blood samples were

599

longitudinally analyzed at 7, 10, 20 and 30 days after each dose. The collected whole blood was either

600

directly stimulated for 16hrs with peptide pools specific for the Spike (line) or NP protein (shaded

601

area), or immediately processed with Ficoll‐density gradient centrifugation to isolate PBMCs. A

602

standard IFN‐γ ELISPOT assay using the SpG‐ or NP‐specific peptide pools was then setup using the

603

freshly isolated PBMCs. The quantity of secreted IFN‐γ in stimulated whole blood (red line) was

604

compared to the frequency of peptide reactive PBMCs quantified by IFN‐γ ELISPOT (black line). C) The
