Abstract
A recent genetic association study (Ellinghaus et al. 2020) identified a gene cluster on chromosome 3
as a risk locus for respiratory failure in SARS-CoV-2. Recent data comprising 3,199 hospitalized
COVID-19 patients and controls reproduce this and find that it is the major genetic risk factor for
severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalization (COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative). Here, we
show that the risk is conferred by a genomic segment of ~50 kb that is inherited from Neandertals and
occurs at a frequency of ~30% in south Asia and ~8% in Europe.

Main text
The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused considerable morbidity and mortality, claiming
the lives of more than half a million people to date (WHO 2020). The disease caused by the virus,
COVID-19, is characterized by a wide spectrum of severity of clinical manifestations, ranging from
asymptomatic virus carriers to individuals experiencing rapid progression to respiratory failure (Vetter
et al. 2020). Early in the pandemic it became clear that advanced age is a major risk factor, as well as
male sex and some co-morbidities (Zhou et al. 2020). These risk factors, however, do not fully
explain why some have no or mild symptoms while others become seriously ill. Thus, genetic risk
factors are being investigated. An early study (Ellinghaus et al. 2020) identified two genomic regions
associated with severe COVID-19: one region on chromosome 3 containing six genes and one region
on chromosome 9 that determines the ABO blood group. A recently released dataset from the
COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative finds that the region on chromosome 3 is the only region
significantly associated with severe COVID-19 at the genome-wide level (Fig. 1A) while the signal
from the region determining ABO-blood group is not replicated (The COVID-19 Host Genetics
Initiative 2020).
The genetic variants which are associated with severe COVID-19 on chromosome 3 (chr3:
45,859,651-45,909,024, hg19) are all in high linkage disequilibrium (LD), i.e. they are all strongly
associated with each other in the population (r 2>0.99), and span 49.4 thousand bases (kb) (Fig. 1B). A
haplotype of such length could be due to positive selection, to an unusually low recombination rate in
the region, or to that the haplotype entered the human population by gene flow from Neandertals or
Denisovans that occurred some 40,000 to 60,000 years ago (Sankararaman et al. 2012). Positive
selection seems unlikely at least under current conditions when the odds ratio for respiratory
insufficiency upon SARS-CoV-2 for heterozygous carriers of the haplotype is 1.70 (95% CI, 1.27 to
2.26, Ellinghaus et al. 2020). The recombination rate in the region is not unusually low (0.53 cM/mb,
Kong et al. 2002). We therefore investigated whether the haplotype may have come from Neandertals
or Denisovans.
The previously identified lead risk insertion variant (rs11385942) (Ellinghaus et al. 2020) is present in
all 33 DNA fragments covering this this position in the Vindija 33.19 Neandertal, a ~50,000-old-old
Neandertal from Croatia in southern Europe (Prüfer et al. 2017). Of 14 single nucleotide variants in
the 1000 Genomes Project that are in high LD (r 2>0.99) with the insertion risk variant in Eurasian
populations, 12 occur in a homozygous form in the Vindija 33.19 Neandertal (Fig. 1B). Four of these
variants occur the “Altai” as well as in the Chagyrskaya 8 Neandertals, both of whom come from the
Altai Mountains in southern Siberia and are ~120,000 and ~50,000 years old, respectively (Table S1)
while none occur in the Denisovan genome. Thus, the risk haplotype is similar to the corresponding
genomic region in the Neandertal from Croatia and less similar to the Neandertals from Siberia.

We next investigated whether the risk haplotype of 49.4 kb might be inherited by both Neandertals
and present-day people from the common ancestors of the two groups that lived in the order of
500,000 years ago (Prüfer et al. 2014). The longer a present-day haplotype that shared with
Neandertals is, the less likely this is to be the case as recombination in each generations will tend to
break up haplotypes into smaller segments. Assuming a generational time of 29 years (Langergraber
et al. 2012), the local recombination rate (0.53 cM/Mb), a split between Neandertals and modern
humans of 550,000 years (Prüfer et al. 2014), and interbreeding between the two groups ~50,000
years ago, and using a published equation (Huerta-Sánchez et al. 2020), we exclude that the
Neandertal-like haplotype derives from the common ancestor (p = 0.0009). It thus entered the
modern human population from Neandertals. Its close relationship to the Croatian Vindija 33.19
Neandertal is compatible with that this Neandertal has been shown to be closer to the majority of the
Neandertals who contributed DNA to present-day people than the other two Neandertals (Mafessoni
et al. 2020).
A Neandertal DNA haplotype present in the genomes of people living today is expected to be more
similar to a Neandertal genome than to other haplotypes in the current human population. To
investigate the relationships of the 49.4 kb-haplotype to Neandertal and to other human haplotypes we
analysed all 5,008 genomes in the 1000 Genome Project for this genomic region. We included all
positions which are called in the Neandertal genomes and excluded variants found on only one
chromosome and haplotypes seen only once in the 1000 Genomes data. This resulted in 253 presentday haplotypes containing 450 variable positions. Figure 2 shows a phylogenetic tree relating such
haplotypes found more than 10 times (see Fig. S1 for all haplotypes). We find that all risk haplotypes
associated with the risk for severe COVID-19 form a clade with the three high-coverage Neandertal
genomes. Within this clade, they are most closely related to the Vindija 33.19 Neandertal.
Among the individuals in the 1000 Genome Project, the Neanderthal-derived risk haplotypes is almost
completely absent in Africa, consistent with that gene flow from Neandertals into African populations
was limited and probably indirect (Chen et al. 2020). The Neandertal haplotype occurs in South Asia
at a frequency of 30%, in Europa at 8%, among admixed Americans at 4% and at lower frequencies in
East Asia. The highest frequency occurs in Bangladesh, where more than half the population (63%)
carries at least one copy of the Neandertal risk variant and 13% is homozygous for the variant. The
Neandertal variant may thus be a substantial contributor to COVID-19 risk in certain populations.
Currently it is not known what feature in the Neandertal-derived region confers risk for severe
COVID-19 and if the effects of any such feature is specific to current coronaviruses or indeed to any
other pathogens. Once this is elucidated, it may be possible to speculate about the susceptibility of
Neandertals to relevant pathogens. However, in the current pandemic, it is clear that gene flow from
Neandertals has tragic consequences.
