SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerged coronavirus responsible for the current COVID19 pandemic that has resulted in more than one million infections and 73,000
deaths1,2. Vaccine and therapeutic discovery efforts are paramount to curb the
pandemic spread of this zoonotic virus. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein
promotes entry into host cells and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies.
Here we describe multiple monoclonal antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 S
identified from memory B cells of a SARS survivor infected in 2003. One
antibody, named S309, potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV
pseudoviruses as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2 by engaging the S receptorbinding domain. Using cryo-electron microscopy and binding assays, we show
that S309 recognizes a glycan-containing epitope that is conserved within the
sarbecovirus subgenus, without competing with receptor attachment. Antibody
cocktails including S309 along with other antibodies identified here further
enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and may limit the emergence of
neutralization-escape mutants. These results pave the way for using S309 and
S309-containing antibody cocktails for prophylaxis in individuals at high risk of
exposure or as a post-exposure therapy to limit or treat severe disease.

41

Coronavirus entry into host cells is mediated by the transmembrane spike (S)

42

glycoprotein that forms homotrimers protruding from the viral surface3. The S

43

glycoprotein comprises two functional subunits: S1 (divided into A, B, C and D domains)

44

that is responsible for binding to host cell receptors and S2 that promotes fusion of the

45

viral and cellular membranes4,5. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV belong to the

46

sarbecovirus subgenus and their S glycoproteins share 80% amino acid sequence

47

identity6. SARS-CoV-2 S is closely related to the bat SARS-related CoV (SARSr-CoV)

48

RaTG13 with which it shares 97.2% amino acid sequence identity1. We and others

49

recently demonstrated that human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) is a

50

functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as is the case for SARS-CoV1,6-8. The S domain

51

B (SB) is the receptor binding domain (RBD) and binds to hACE2 with high-affinity,

52

possibly contributing to the current rapid SARS-CoV-2 transmission in humans6,9, as

53

previously proposed for SARS-CoV10.

54

As the coronavirus S glycoprotein mediates entry into host cells, it is the main

55

target of neutralizing antibodies and the focus of therapeutic and vaccine design

56

efforts3. The S trimers are extensively decorated with N-linked glycans that are

57

important for protein folding11 and modulate accessibility to host proteases and

58

neutralizing antibodies12-15. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) structures of SARS-

59

CoV-2 S in two distinct functional states6,9 along with cryoEM and crystal structures of

60

SARS-CoV-2 SB in complex with hACE216-18 revealed dynamic states of SB domains,

61

providing a blueprint for the design of vaccines and inhibitors of viral entry.

62

Passive administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could have a major

63

impact on controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic by providing immediate protection,

64

complementing the development of prophylactic vaccines. Accelerated development

65

of mAbs in a pandemic setting could be reduced to 5-6 months compared to the

66

traditional timeline of 10-12 months (Kelley B., Developing monoclonal antibodies at

67

pandemic speed, Nat Biotechnol, in press). The recent finding that ansuvimab

68

(mAb114) is a safe and effective treatment for symptomatic Ebola virus infection is a

69

striking example of the successful use of mAb therapy during an infectious disease

70

outbreak19,20. We previously isolated potently neutralizing human mAbs from memory

71

B cells of individuals infected with SARS-CoV21 or MERS-CoV22. Passive transfer of

72

these mAbs protected animals challenged with various SARS-CoV isolates and SARS-

73

related CoV (SARSr-CoV)21,23,24, as well as with MERS-CoV22. Structural

74

75

S provided molecular-level information on the mechanisms of viral neutralization14. In

76

particular, while both mAbs blocked SB attachment to the host receptor, the SARS-

77

CoV-neutralizing S230 mAb acted by functionally mimicking receptor-attachment and

78

promoting S fusogenic conformational rearrangements14. Another mechanism of

79

SARS-CoV neutralization was recently described for mAb CR3022, which bound a

80

cryptic epitope only accessible when at least two out of the three SB domains of a S

81

trimer were in the open conformation25,26. However, none of these mAbs neutralize

82

SARS-CoV-2.

83
84

Identification of a potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAb from a SARS survivor

85

We previously identified a set of human neutralizing mAbs from an individual

86

infected with SARS-CoV in 2003 that potently inhibited both human and zoonotic

87

SARS-CoV isolates21,23,27. To characterize the potential cross-reactivity of these

88

antibodies with SARS-CoV-2, we performed a new memory B cell screening using

89

peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected in 2013 from the same patient. We

90

describe here nineteen mAbs from the initial screen (2004 blood draw)21,23 and six

91

mAbs from the new screen (2013 blood draw). The identified mAbs had a broad V

92

gene usage and were not clonally related (Table 1). Eight out of the twenty five mAbs

93

bound to SARS-CoV-2 S and SARS-CoV S transfected CHO cells with EC50 values

94

ranging between 1.4 and 6,100 ng/ml, and 0.8 and 254 ng/ml, respectively (Fig. 1a-

95

b). MAbs were further evaluated for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV SB

96

domains as well as to the prefusion-stabilized OC43 S28, MERS-CoV S29,30, SARS-

97

CoV S30 and SARS-CoV-2 S6 ectodomain trimers. None of the mAbs studied bound to

98

prefusion OC43 S or MERS-CoV S ectodomain trimers, indicating a lack of cross-

99

reactivity outside the sarbecovirus subgenus (Extended Data Fig.1). MAbs S303,

100

S304, S309 and S315 recognized the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs. In

101

particular, S309 bound with nanomolar affinity to both SB domains, as determined by

102

biolayer interferometry (Fig. 1c-d, Extended Data Fig. 2). Unexpectedly, S306 and

103

S310 stained cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S at higher levels than those expressing

104

SARS-CoV S, yet it did not interact with SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV S ectodomain

105

trimers and RBD constructs by ELISA. These results suggest that they may recognize

106

post-fusion SARS-CoV-2 S, which was recently proposed to be abundant on the

107

surface of authentic SARS-CoV-2 viruses31 (Fig. 1a-b and Extended Data Fig.3).

108

To evaluate the neutralization potency of the SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive

109

mAbs, we carried out pseudovirus neutralization assays using a murine leukemia virus

110

(MLV) pseudotyping system32. S309 showed comparable neutralization potencies

111

against both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses, whereas S303 neutralized

112

SARS-CoV-MLV but not SARS-CoV-2-MLV. S304 and S315 weakly neutralized

113

SARS-CoV-MLV and SARS-CoV-2-MLV (Extended Data Fig.4). In addition, S309

114

neutralized SARS-CoV-MLVs from isolates of the 3 phases of the 2002-2003 epidemic

115

with IC50 values comprised between 120 and 180 ng/ml and partially neutralized the

116

SARSr-CoV33 WIV-1 (Fig. 1e). Finally, mAb S309 potently neutralized authentic

117

SARS-CoV-2 (2019n-CoV/USA_WA1/2020) with an IC50 of 69 ng/ml (Fig. 1f).

118
119

Structural basis of S309 cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV

120

To study the mechanisms of S309-mediated neutralization, we characterized

121

the complex between the S309 Fab fragment and a prefusion stabilized SARS-CoV-2

122

S ectodomain trimer6 using single-particle cryoEM. Similar to our previous study of apo

123

SARS-CoV-2 S6, 3D classification of the cryoEM data enabled identification of two

124

structural states: a trimer with one SB domain open and a closed trimer. We determined

125

3D reconstructions of the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain trimer with a single open SB

126

domain and in a closed state (applying 3-fold symmetry), both with three S309 Fabs

127

bound, at 3.7 Å and 3.3 Å resolution, respectively (Fig. 2a-c, Extended Data Fig. 5

128

and Table 2). In parallel, we also determined a crystal structure of the S309 Fab at 3.3

129

Å resolution to assist model building (Table 3). The S309 Fab bound to the open SB

130

domain is weakly resolved in the cryoEM map, due to marked conformational variability

131

of the upward pointing SB domain, and was not modeled in density. The analysis below

132

is based on the closed state structure.

133

S309 recognizes a protein/glycan epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 SB, distinct from

134

the receptor-binding motif. The epitope is accessible in both the open and closed S

135

states, explaining the stoichiometric binding of Fab to the S trimer (Fig. 2a-c). The

136

S309 paratope is composed of all six CDR loops that burie a surface area of ~1,050Å2

137

at the interface with SB through electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic contacts.

138

The 20-residue long CDRH3 sits atop the SB helix comprising residues 337-344 and

139

also contacts the edge of the SB five-stranded b-sheet (residues 356-361), overall

140

accounting for ~50% of the buried surface area (Fig. 2d-e). CDRL1 and CDRL2 extend

141

the epitope by interacting with the helix spanning residues 440-444 that is located near

142

the S 3-fold molecular axis. CDRH3 and CDRL2 sandwich the SARS-CoV-2 S glycan

143

at position N343 through contacts with the core fucose moiety (in agreement with the

144

detection of SARS-CoV-2 N343 core-fucosylated peptides by mass-spectrometry34)

145

and to a lesser extent with the core N-acetyl-glucosamine (Fig. 2d). These latter

146

interactions bury an average surface of ~170 Å2 and stabilize the N343 oligosaccharide

147

which is resolved to a much larger extent than in the apo SARS-CoV-2 S structures6,9.

148

The structural data explain the S309 cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and

149

SARS-CoV as 19 out of 24 residues of the epitope are strictly conserved (Fig. 2f and

150

Extended Data Fig. 6a-b). R346SARS-CoV-2, R357SARS-CoV-2, N354SARS-CoV-2 and

151

L441SARS-CoV-2 are conservatively substituted to K333SARS-CoV, K344SARS-CoV (except for

152

SARS-CoV isolate GZ02 where it is R444SARS-CoV), E341SARS-CoV and I428SARS-CoV

153

whereas K444SARS-CoV-2 is semi-conservatively substituted to T431SARS-CoV, in

154

agreement with the comparable binding affinities to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S

155

(Fig. 1c). The oligosaccharide at position N343 is also conserved in both viruses and

156

corresponds to SARS-CoV N330, for which we previously detected core-fucosylated

157

glycopeptides by mass spectrometry14 which would allow for similar interactions with

158

the S309 Fab. Analysis of the S glycoprotein sequences of the 2,229 SARS-CoV-2

159

isolates reported to date indicates that several mutations have occurred with variable

160

frequency on the SARS-CoV-2 S ectodomain (Extended Data Fig. 7a-b) but no

161

mutations arose within the epitope recognized by S309 mAb. Finally, S309 contact

162

residues showed a high degree of conservation across clade 1, 2 and 3 sarbecovirus

163

human and animal isolates35 (Extended Data Fig. 7c). Collectively, the structural data

164

indicate that S309 could neutralize all SARS-CoV-2 isolates circulating to date and

165

possibly most other zoonotic sarbecoviruses.

166
167

Mechanism of S309-mediated neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV

168

The cryoEM structure of S309 bound to SARS-CoV-2 S presented here

169

combined with the structures of SARS-CoV-2 SB and SARS-CoV SB in complex with

170

ACE216-18,36 indicate that the Fab engages an epitope distinct from the receptor-binding

171

motif and would not clash with ACE2 upon binding to S (Figure 3a-b). Biolayer

172

interferometry analysis of S309 Fab or IgG binding to the SARS-CoV-2 SB domain or

173

the S ectodomain trimer confirmed the absence of competition between the mAb and

174

ACE2 for binding to SARS-CoV-2 S (Figure 3c and Extended Data Fig. 8).

175

To further investigate the mechanism of S309-mediated neutralization, we

176

compared side-by-side transduction of SARS-CoV-2-MLV in the presence of either

177

S309 Fab or S309 IgG. Both experiments yielded comparable IC50 values (3.8 and 3.5

178

nM, respectively), indicating similar potencies for IgG and Fab (Fig. 3d). However, The

179

S309 IgG reached 100% neutralization, whereas the S309 Fab plateaued at ~80%

180

neutralization (Fig. 3d). This result indicates that one or more IgG-specific bivalent

181

mechanisms, such as S trimer cross-linking, steric hindrance or aggregation of

182

virions37, may contribute to the ability to fully neutralize pseudovirions.

183

Fc-dependent effector mechanisms, such as NK-mediated antibody-dependent

184

cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) can

185

contribute to viral control in infected individuals. We observed efficient S309- and

186

S306-mediated ADCC of SARS-CoV-2 S-transfected cells, whereas the other mAbs

187

tested showed limited or no activity (Fig. 3e and Extended Data Fig. 9a). These

188

findings might be related to distinct binding orientations and/or positioning of the mAb

189

Fc fragment relative to the FcgRIIIa receptors. ADCC was observed only using NK

190

(effector) cells expressing the high-affinity FcgRIIIa variant (V158) but not the low-

191

affinity variant (F158) (Fig. 3e). These results, which we confirmed using a FcgRIIIa

192

cell reporter assay (Fig. 3f), suggest that S309 Fc engineering could potentially

193

enhance activation of NK cells with the low-affinity FcgRIIIa variant (F158)38.

194

Macrophage or dendritic cell-mediated ADCP can contribute to viral control by clearing

195

virus and infected cells and by stimulating T cell response via presentation of viral

196

antigens39,40. Similar to the ADCC results, mAbs S309 and S306 showed the strongest

197

ADCP response (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 8b). FcgRIIa signaling, however,

198

was only observed for S309 (Fig. 3h). These findings suggest that ADCP by

199

monocytes was dependent on both FcgRIIIa and FcgRIIa engagement. Collectively,

200

these results demonstrate that in addition to potent in vitro neutralization, S309 may

201

leverage additional protective mechanisms in vivo, as previously shown for other

202

antiviral antibodies41,42.

208

CoV and SARS-CoV-2 SB domains (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig.10). This analysis

209

identified at least four antigenic sites within the SB domain of SARS-CoV targeted by

210

our panel of mAbs. The receptor-binding motif, which is targeted by S230, S227 and

211

S110, is termed site I. Sites II and III are defined by S315 and S124, respectively, and

212

the two sites were bridged by mAb S304. Site IV is defined by S309, S109, and S303

213

mAbs. Given the lower number of mAbs cross-reacting with SARS-CoV-2, we were

214

able to identify sites IV targeted by S309 and S303, and site II-III targeted by S304 and

215

S315 (Fig. 4b).

216

Based on the above findings, we evaluated the neutralization potency of the site

217

IV S309 mAb in combination with either the site II S315 mAb or site II-III S304 mAb.

218

Although S304 and S315 alone were weakly neutralizing, the combination of either of

219

these mAbs with S309 resulted in an enhanced neutralization potency, compared to

220

single mAbs, against both SARS-CoV-2-MLV and authentic SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4c-d

221

and Fig. 1e). A synergistic effect between two non-competing anti-RBD mAbs has

222

been already reported for SARS-CoV43 and our data extend this observation to SARS-

223

CoV-2, providing a proof-of-concept for the use of mAbs combinations to prevent or

224

control SARS-CoV-2.

225

In summary, our study identifies S309 as a human mAb with broad neutralizing

226

activity against multiple sarbecoviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, via recognition of a

227

highly conserved epitope in the SB domain comprising the N343-glycan (N330 in

228

SARS-CoV S). Furthermore, S309 can recruit effector mechanisms and synergizes

229

with weakly neutralizing mAbs, which may mitigate the risk of viral escape. Our data

230

indicate the potential to discover potently neutralizing pan-sarbecovirus mAbs,

231

highlight antigenic sites to include in vaccine design, and pave the way to support

232

preparedness for future sarbecovirus outbreaks. As S309 bears the promise to be an

233

effective countermeasure to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2,

234

Fc variants of S309 with increased half-life and effector functions have entered an

235

accelerated development path towards clinical trials.

Measurement of Fc-effector functions

343

ADCC assays were performed using ExpiCHO-S cells transient transfected with

344

SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 S as targets. Target cells were incubated with titrated

345

concentrations of mAbs and after 10 minutes incubated with primary human NK cells

346

as effector cells at an effector:target ratio of 9:1. NK cells were isolated from fresh

347

blood of healthy donors using the MACSxpress NK Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat.

348

Nr.: 130-098-185). ADCC was measured using LDH release assay (Cytotoxicity

349

Detection Kit (LDH) (Roche; Cat. Nr.: 11644793001) after 4 hours of incubation at

350

37°C.

351

ADCP assays were performed using ExpiCHO-S target cells transiently transfected

352

with SARS-CoV-2 S and fluorescently labeled with PKH67 Fluorescent Cell Linker Kits

353

(Sigma Aldrich, Cat. Nr.: MINI67) as targets. Target cells were incubated with titrated

354

412

(ThermoFisher Scientific) with cells grown to a density of 106 cells per mL and

413

cultivated for three days. The supernatant was harvested and cells were resuspended

414

for another three days, yielding two harvests. Clarified supernatants were purified

415

using a 5mL Cobalt affinity column (Takara). Purified protein was filtered or

416

concentrated and flash frozen in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 150 mM

417

441

images were extracted with a box size of 800 binned to 400 yielding a pixel size of 1.05

442

Å. For each data set two rounds of reference-free 2D classification were performed

443

using cryoSPARC 50 to select well-defined particle images. Subsequently, two rounds

444

of 3D classification with 50 iterations each (angular sampling 7.5˚ for 25 iterations and

445

1.8˚ with local search for 25 iterations), using our previously reported closed SARS-

446

CoV-2 S structure6 as initial model, were carried out using Relion

447

symmetry to separate distinct SARS-CoV-2 S conformations. 3D refinements were

448

carried out using non-uniform refinement along with per-particle defocus refinement in

449

cryoSPARC50. Particle images were subjected to Bayesian polishing

450

performing another round of non-uniform refinement in cryoSPARC 50 followed by per-

451

particle defocus refinement and again non-uniform refinement. Reported resolutions

452

are based on the gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (FSC) of 0.143 criterion and

Sequence alignment

480

SARS-CoV-2 genomics sequences were downloaded from GISAID on March

481

29th 2020, using the “complete (>29,000 bp)” and “low coverage exclusion” filters. Bat

482

and pangolin sequences were removed to yield human-only sequences. The spike

483

ORF was localized by performing reference protein (YP_009724390.1)-genome

484

alignments with GeneWise2. Incomplete matches and indel-containing ORFs were

485

rescued and included in downstream analysis. Nucleotide sequences were

486

translated in silico using seqkit. Sequences with more than 10% undetermined

487

aminoacids (due to N basecalls) were removed. Multiple sequence alignment was

488

performed using MAFFT. Variants were determined by comparison of aligned

489

sequences (n=2,229) to the reference sequence using the R/Bioconductor package

490

Biostrings. A similar strategy was used to extract and translate spike protein

491

sequences from SARS-CoV genomes sourced from ViPR (search criteria: SARS-

492

related coronavirus, full-length genomes, human host, deposited before December

493

2019 to exclude SARS-CoV-2, n=53). Sourced SARS-CoV genome sequences

494

comprised all the major published strains, such as Urbani, Tor2, TW1, P2, Frankfurt1,

495

among others. Pangolin sequences as shown by Tsan-Yuk Lam et al68 were sourced

496

from GISAID. Bat sequences from the three clades of sarbecoviruses as shown by Lu
