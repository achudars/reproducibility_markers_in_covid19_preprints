ABSTRACT
Single-cell transcriptomic studies that require intracellular protein staining, rare cell sorting, or
inactivation of infectious pathogens are severely limited because current high-throughput RNA
sequencing methods are incompatible with paraformaldehyde treatment, a common tissue and cell
fixation and preservation technique. Here we present FD-seq, a high-throughput method for
droplet-based RNA sequencing of paraformaldehyde-fixed, stained and sorted single-cells. We
show that FD-seq preserves the mRNA integrity and relative abundances during fixation and
subsequent cell retrieval. Furthermore, FD-seq detects a higher number of genes and transcripts
than methanol fixation. We applied FD-seq to investigate two important questions in Virology.

First, by analyzing a rare population of cells supporting lytic reactivation of the human tumor virus
KSHV, we identified TMEM119 as a host factor that mediates viral reactivation. Second, we found
that upon infection with the betacoronavirus OC43, which causes the common cold and is a close
relative of SARS-CoV-2, pro-inflammatory pathways are primarily upregulated in lowly-infected
cells that are exposed to the virus but fail to express high levels of viral genes. FD-seq thus enables
integrating phenotypic with transcriptomic information in rare cell populations, and preserving and
inactivating pathogenic samples that cannot be handled under regular biosafety measures.

INTRODUCTION
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has found important biological applications, from
discovery of new cell types1 to mapping the transcriptional landscape of human embryonic stem
cells2. Droplet-based scRNA-seq technologies, such as Drop-seq3 and 10X Chromium4, are
particularly powerful due to their high throughput: thousands of single cells can be analyzed in a
single experiment. However, even with these high-throughput techniques, analyzing rare cell
populations remains a challenging task, often requiring protein-based enrichment for the cell
population of interest before scRNA-seq5,6.
Many cell types require intracellular protein staining to be enriched. For example, Foxp3
is an intracellular marker of regulatory T cells7, and Oct4 and Nanog are intracellular
reprogramming markers of induced pluripotent stem cells8. Intracellular protein staining requires
cell fixation, which is most commonly achieved with paraformaldehyde (PFA) or methanol
fixation. Drop-seq and 10X Chromium have been shown to be compatible with methanol-fixed
cells9,10, but not with PFA fixation. In many applications, PFA fixation is preferred over methanol

fixation due to its better signal-to-noise ratio for intracellular staining11,12, and the improved
preservation of fluorescent protein activity. scRNA-seq of PFA-fixed cells has only been achieved
with a low throughput plate-based method5, severely limiting the applicability of this method to a
wide range of problems that search for rare phenotypes in broad cellular populations. A highthroughput scRNA-seq method of PFA-fixed cells would enable the application of single cell
analysis for many problems in signaling, immunity, development, stem cells, and infectious
diseases.
Here we describe FD-seq (Fixed Droplet RNA sequencing), a droplet-based highthroughput RNA sequencing of PFA-fixed, stained and sorted single cells. We show that FD-seq
preserves the RNA integrity and relative transcripts abundances compared to standard Drop-seq
for live cells. We also show that FD-seq is superior to the methanol fixation protocol, yielding a
higher number of detected genes and transcripts.
As a proof-of-concept, we applied FD-seq to study two important problems in Virology.
First, we studied the low-level reactivation of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV)
in tumor cells. KSHV, also known as human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8), is a human
gammaherpesvirus that causes a number of malignancies such as Kaposi's sarcoma, primary
effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman's disease13,14. There is a considerable interest in
unraveling the molecular details of the host factors that modulate KSHV latency and reactivation,
because both latency and low-level reactivation are known to contribute to viral tumorigenesis15,
and therapeutic induction of reactivation could sensitize latently-infected cells to currently
available anti-herpesvirus drugs16. Detailed analysis of KSHV reactivation, however, is currently
limited by this restricted reactivation: only a small proportion of latently-infected cells typically
undergoes reactivation, even when treated with known chemical inducing agents such as sodium

butyrate (NaBut) and tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA)13. We hypothesized that the differences
in the abundance of specific host factors between individual cells contribute to the propensity of
latently KSHV-infected cells to enter lytic reactivation. Using FD-seq, we present the first singlecell transcriptomic analysis of human primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells undergoing
reactivation. We found that in reactivated cells, the expression levels of viral genes were extremely
heterogeneous, with some cells expressing moderate levels of viral transcripts (below 50% of all
detected transcripts) and other cells up to 95%. Additionally, we identified four host genes, CDH1,
CORO1C, ISCU and TMEM119, whose expression levels strongly correlated with the extent of
viral reactivation. Through overexpression and silencing studies, we show that TMEM119, a gene
with unknown functions, plays an important direct role in promoting KSHV reactivation.
Second, the ability to fixate infected cells or patient-derived materials greatly facilitates the
study of virus infected cells outside high-containment BSL-3 facilities that are often not readily
available. To demonstrate a potential application of FD-seq in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,
we applied it to study the infection of OC43, a human betacoronavirus and a close relative of
SARS-CoV-2, at the single-cell level. OC43 is a human pathogen that causes the common cold,
and we have successfully used to it discover drugs that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro17.
Using FD-seq, we show that instead of the infected cells, bystander cells that express a low level
of viral genes are the actual drivers of pro-inflammatory gene expression during coronavirus
infection18.
Thus, FD-seq is a valuable tool for studying rare cell populations, and provides flexibility
in choosing the cell fixation or pathogen inactivation method for researchers.

RESULTS
Development of FD-seq for sequencing of PFA fixed single cells
In the standard Drop-seq protocol, single cells are partitioned with uniquely barcoded ceramic
beads inside nanoliter droplets in oil, using a microfluidic device3. The cells are individually lysed
inside the droplets, and their mRNAs are captured by the oligonucleotides on the beads. Next, the
droplets are broken to recover the beads, and the beads are extensively washed to remove
uncaptured mRNAs. After pooling the beads, the captured mRNAs undergo reverse transcription,
exonuclease I digestion of free oligonucleotides on the beads, and whole transcriptome
amplification. Finally, the barcoded and amplified cDNAs are tagmented and sequenced.
PFA fixation of cells induces crosslinking between nucleic acids and proteins. To extract
RNA from PFA-fixed cells, a cross-link reversal step is therefore required. First, we tested
different heating conditions for the cross-link reversal step at bulk level, followed by lysing the
uncross-linked cells with Drop-seq lysis buffer, and total RNA extraction using a commercial kit
(Fig. 1a and S1, see Methods). We found that a 1-hour incubation at 56oC in the standard Dropseq lysis buffer efficiently reversed PFA cross-linking, in agreement with previous literature5. The
RNA yield was further improved by the addition of proteinase K to the lysis buffer at an optimal
concentration of 40 units/mL (Fig. 1a, Fig. S1a). Whereas proteinase K treatment did not
significantly affect the RNA quality at any of the tested concentrations, consistently resulting in
high quality total RNA demonstrated by high (above 8.0) RNA integrity numbers (Fig. S1b,c), we
observed that increasing the proteinase K concentration above 40 units/mL resulted in a reduction
in the overall RNA yield (Fig. S1a).

and FD-seq. The multiplet rate for live cells and fixed cells were ~0.5% and ~1%, respectively.
For Drop-seq experiment, live human BC3 cells were combined with live mouse 3T3 cells and

cells were fixed separately, then pooled and processed with the modified FD-seq protocol. (c)

Next, we compared the extent of inter-droplet RNA contamination between the standard
Drop-seq protocol on live cells and the FD-seq method on PFA-fixed cells by performing ‘species6

mixing’ experiments. We either used the standard Drop-seq protocol to analyze a 1-to-1 mixture
of live BC3 cells, a human PEL cell line, and mouse 3T3 cells, or used FD-seq to analyze BC3
and 3T3 cells that were fixed with 4% PFA and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X separately
before combining them at a 1-to-1 ratio. The RNA-seq results were aligned to a combined humanmouse reference genome, and the number of human and mouse transcripts per single cell barcode
was then calculated. The rate of cell barcodes having both mouse and human transcripts, which
indicates cross-droplet contamination and/or multiple cells captured in the same droplet, were very
similar and only minimally observed in both live and fixed cell experiments (~0.5% and ~1% for
live and fixed cells, respectively, Fig. 1b). This indicates that the modifications of FD-seq did not
affect the single-cell capture efficiency of Drop-seq.
These experiments also showed that the number of genes detected in fixed cells using was
comparable to that of live cells across species (median of 640 genes in fixed cells compared to 675
genes in live cells for human cells, and median of 734 genes compared to 724 genes for mouse
cells) (Fig. 1c). The relative expression levels of the detected genes were well correlated between
live and fixed cells (Fig. 1d), even though fewer transcripts were detected in fixed cells than in
live cells on average (Fig. 1b, Fig. S2a). Finally, live and fixed cells showed a similar percentage
of reads mapped to introns and exons (Fig. S2b).
Taken together, these results demonstrate that FD-seq is a reliable method for whole
transcriptome analysis of PFA-fixed single cells. The performance of single-cell sequencing is
maintained with fixed cells when FD-Seq is utilized, and FD-seq shows comparable performance
to the standard Drop-seq protocol used for live (unfixed) cells. Reliable sequencing of PFA fixed
cells with high transcript recovery can be very useful for single cell studies.

PFA fixation detects a higher number of genes and transcripts compared to methanol
fixation in single cells
We next investigated how the effects of PFA fixation in FD-seq compare to methanol (MeOH)
fixation. Methanol fixation has recently been shown to be compatible with Drop-seq9 by
introducing a suitable rehydration step before droplet generation. Here we fixed A549 cells, a
human lung epithelial cell line, with either PFA or methanol, and then analyzed the single-cell
transcriptomes by RNA-seq using the FD-seq or Drop-seq protocol, respectively (see Methods).

Figure 2. Comparison between PFA and methanol fixation shows higher gene and transcript
recovery with FD-seq. (a) Violin and box plots of the number of UMIs, the number of genes and
the percentage of mitochondrial genes detected in single A549 cells for each fixation method. The
numbers by the violin plot indicate the median values. The middle line inside the box indicates the
median, the upper and lower edges of the box indicate the first and third quartiles, and the whiskers
extend to 1.5× the interquartile range beyond first and third quartiles. (b) The effects of sequencing
depth on the number of detected UMIs and genes per cell. (c) The distribution of mapped reads to
different genomic regions. (d) Correlation of the log-normalized average expression level of each
gene between the two fixation methods. The plot also shows the Pearson’s correlation coefficient
ρ. The red line indicates the y=x line. (e) Technical variance of each gene estimated by the gene’s
mean and squared coefficient of variation (CV2).
We found that PFA fixation resulted in a higher number of detected transcripts, or UMIs,
(median 8,083 compared to 6,194 transcripts) and genes (median 3,049 compared to 2,856 genes),
and a lower percentage of mitochondrial genes (median 6.2% compared to 11.9%) than methanol
fixation (Fig. 2a). To determine the effect of sequencing depth on the number of UMIs and genes,
we randomly sub-sampled the sequencing reads and found that PFA fixation still returned a higher
number of UMIs and genes (Fig. 2b). The effect of sequencing depth on the number of transcripts
is much more pronounced: the difference between the two fixation techniques could reach almost
2,000 UMIs. This could be because a higher proportion of reads in methanol-fixed cells mapped
to the intronic and intergenic regions (Fig. 2c). Despite this, the average gene expression levels
were well correlated between the two fixation methods (Pearson’s correlation coefficient was
approximately 0.90, Fig. 2d). Lastly, we estimated the technical variance of each method by
calculating the gene-level coefficient of variation (CV)19. As expected, for both fixation methods,
low- and high-abundance genes had higher and lower variance, respectively. In addition, both
methods exhibited very similar technical variance. In summary, FD-seq was able to recover more
genes and transcripts than methanol fixation, and both PFA- and methanol-fixed cells showed
similar average gene expression levels and technical variance.

FD-seq reveals heterogeneity in KSHV reactivated single tumor cells
Having established the validity of FD-seq for the single-cell transcriptome analysis of PFA-fixed
cells, we applied FD-seq to test the hypothesis that the heterogeneity in specific host genes
contributed to the restricted KSHV reactivation, and to identify those genes.

To identify lytically reactivated cells, we measured expression of the intracellular viral

did not observe any appreciable K8.1 expression in untreated BC3 cells (Fig. S3a). However,
treatment with NaBut or TPA to induce KSHV reactivation resulted in a small fraction of cells
expressing K8.1 (~8% vs ~2.1%, respectively) (Fig. S3b). To enrich for reactivated cells, TPAtreated BC3 cells were fixed and sorted by FACS based on the expression level of the K8.1 protein
(Fig. S4), followed by single-cell transcriptome analysis with FD-seq. We obtained high-quality
transcriptome information for 1,035 K8.1+ (reactivated) single cells and 286 K8.1- (latent, nonreactivated) cells. High dimensional clustering and visualization showed clear separation between
reactivated and non-reactivated cells (Fig. 3a), and analysis of the K8.1 mRNA level confirmed
the enrichment of the K8.1+ cell population of interest (Fig. 3b). Moreover, the high proportion
of viral transcripts in the K8.1+ population, 69% on average, compared to only 4% viral transcript
in the K8.1- population confirmed that the sorted population was indeed composed of reactivated
cells (Fig. 3c,d).
Herpesvirus reactivation involves the highly regulated, sequential expression of
immediate-early, early, and late viral genes20 that was recapitulated in our FD-seq results. By
ordering the cells by the percentage of viral genes relative to the total transcript content, we found
that the relative abundance of immediate-early viral genes increased with total viral gene content,
then plateaued after the total viral transcript abundance reached 50% (Fig. 3e-g). Early viral
transcripts also increased early and monotonically with the abundance of total viral transcripts,
without plateauing like the immediate-early genes. On the other hand, late viral transcripts were
only detected in cells with more than 25% total viral transcripts, and increased strongly with higher
total viral transcript abundance. Thus, FD-seq’s results are in agreement with the expected kinetics
of viral gene expression obtained from population-averaged measurements, and suggest that the
percentage of viral transcript content is a good indicator of the stage of KSHV reactivation.

Interestingly, we found that the K8.1+ population was highly heterogeneous in viral
transcript expression: the relative abundance of viral transcripts varied from below 50% to over
90% (Fig. 3d), and the correlation between the expression levels of viral genes was very low, even
between viral genes that have the same kinetics (Fig. 3h and Fig. S5a). This agrees with two recent
studies that showed heterogeneity in host cell factor abundance at the single-cell level in herpes
simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection21, and low correlation in expression of viral genes in a
murine gammaherpesvirus infection model22. This may partially be caused by the fact that the
K8.1+ cells were at different stages of reactivation. Indeed, flow cytometry analysis showed that
K8.1 protein abundance within the positive population varied over one order of magnitude (Fig.
S4). However, this alone could not sufficiently explain the poor correlation between viral genes,
because we also observed low correlation coefficients among cells with similar viral transcript
abundance that are thought to be in the same stages of reactivation (Fig. S5b).
In short, we used FD-seq to successfully characterize KSHV-infected cells undergoing
reactivation from latency, revealing the highly heterogeneous nature of this process.

TMEM119 facilitates KSHV reactivation
Next, we sought to identify host genes that facilitate KSHV reactivation by looking for
differentially expressed host genes that are positively correlated with viral transcript abundance.
We only looked for passively correlated host genes in our analysis because the majority of
differentially expressed genes were negatively correlated with the relative abundance of viral
transcripts (Fig. S6a). While this could suggest that their expression inhibits KSHV reactivation23
(and therefore cells with lower expression are more prone to reactivate), this type of analysis may

be confounded by the high proportion of viral transcripts in the K8.1+ population (up to 96%, Fig.
3d) that prevents reliable determination of host transcript levels in these cells.
We found four host genes whose expression positively correlated with the abundance of
KSHV transcripts: ISCU, CDH1, CORO1C and TMEM119 (q-value < 10-100 for all four genes).
We observed that the expression of ISCU was relatively low in non-reactivated cells, and increased
significantly with the abundance of viral transcripts (Fig. 4a). On the other hand, CDH1, CORO1C
and TMEM119 were mostly undetectable in non-reactivated cells, and increased by 1-2 orders of
magnitude in cells expressing high levels of KSHV. We also confirmed the upregulation of ISCU,
CORO1C and TMEM119 following KSHV reactivation in bulk cell samples by qPCR (Fig. S6b,c).

To determine whether the strong correlation between these host transcripts and KSHV gene
expression means that these genes modulate KSHV reactivation induction and/or efficiency, we
next tested the effect of their overexpression on KSHV reactivation. To this end, we used live-cell
imaging to monitor KSHV reactivation in HEK293T.rKSHV219 cells (which are HEK293T cells
latently infected with the recombinant KSHV.219 virus strain that constitutively expresses GFP
and further encodes RFP under control of the viral lytic PAN promoter24) following exogenous
expression of CDH1, CORO1C, ISCU, or TMEM119. Whereas overexpression of CDH1,
CORO1C, or ISCU had no significant effect on KSHV reactivation efficiency, we observed a clear
increase in RFP expression, which is indicative of viral reactivation, upon ectopic expression of
TMEM119 relative to a GFP-encoding control vector (Fig. 4b, Fig. S7a-c). Conversely, silencing
of endogenous TMEM119 significantly reduced the level of TPA-induced KSHV reactivation (Fig.
4c, Fig S7b,c). These results were corroborated by qRT-qPCR analysis of KSHV lytic gene
expression, which showed that TMEM119 overexpression enhanced KSHV Orf74 expression
compared to the GFP control (Fig. 4d), while TMEM119 silencing led to a reduction in KSHV

Orf50, Orf57, and Orf74 expression (Fig. 4e). Together, these results show that TMEM119
positively modulates KSHV reactivation efficiency.
Not much is known about the function of TMEM119, which has been previously
characterized as a marker for microglia in the human brain25. To determine the potential
mechanism by which TMEM119 enhances KSHV reactivation, we performed bulk transcriptome
analysis of HEK293T cells with and without ectopic expression of TMEM119. We found that in
HEK293T cells, 202 genes were significantly upregulated upon TMEM119 overexpression (Fig.
S8a and Supplementary File 1). KEGG pathway analysis26 showed that these genes were highly
enriched for the MAPK signaling pathway (Fig. S8b). This finding is interesting, as previous
works have implicated the MAPK pathway in KSHV reactivation27,28. Together with this, our data
suggests that TMEM119 promotes viral reactivation via activation of the MAPK signaling
pathway.

FD-seq reveals a pro-inflammatory subpopulation in OC43 infected cells
We next applied FD-seq to study the infection of the betacoronavirus OC43 in single human lung
cells. OC43 is a human pathogen that causes the common cold, and is a close relative of SARSCoV-2. We have recently shown that many drugs that inhibit the replication of OC43 also inhibit
SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro17, suggesting that OC43 is a good model system for SARS-CoV2 infection.
First, we infected A549 cells with OC43 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, fixed the
cells with PFA, and performed FD-seq on mock- and OC43-infected cells. We obtained 1,167 and
1,924 high-quality single cells from mock-infected and OC43-infected cells, respectively. After

regressing out the effects of cell cycle variations (Fig. S9a, b), high dimensional clustering yielded
three main clusters of cells (Fig. 5a). Cluster 0 mainly contained the mock-infected cell, while
clusters 1 and 2 mainly contained OC43-infected cells (Fig. 5b). At an MOI of 1, more than 70%
of the cells showed some level of viral gene expression (Fig. 5c). Interestingly, this infected
population consisted of two subpopulations based, clearly separated by the number of viral
transcripts detected: a larger subpopulation containing a low number of viral transcripts (below
100 UMIs, median 2 UMIs) and a smaller subpopulation containing a much higher number of viral
transcripts (above 100 UMIs, median 428 UMIs) (Fig. 5d). This small subpopulation of highly
infected cells corresponded to cluster 2 (Fig. 5e and Fig. S9c, d).
Next, we sought to investigate the expression profile of OC43 viral genes as a function of
total viral gene level within cluster 2’s cells. Gene N (which encodes the viral nucleocapsid
protein29) was uniformly highly expressed (Fig. 5f). The expression of the remaining viral genes
was more heterogeneous, with ORF1ab, M (membrane gene) and S (spike gene) being more highly
expressed overall. These patterns of viral gene expression level were also true when looking at all
infected cells (Fig. S10).

The vertical dashed line indicates P-value = 0.05.

Cluster 1 consisted of cells that were exposed to the virus but failed to express high levels
of viral genes (Fig. 5d and Fig. S8c, d), and were thus either abortively-infected or uninfected
bystander cells. We found that these bystander cells were enriched in pro-inflammatory genes,
such as CXCL1, CXCL5, CCL2 and NFKBIA (Fig. 5g, Fig. S11, and Supplementary File 2).
CXCL1 and CXCL5 encode the protein ligands of the CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), and
are crucial to neutrophil recruitment30. CCL2 encodes a different chemokine that is responsible for
monocyte recruitment from the bone marrow31. NFKBIA encodes the inhibitor IκBα to the
transcription factor NF-κB, which is an important regulator of the immune response32. KEGG
pathway analysis showed that cluster 1 was enriched for three main pro-inflammatory pathways:
TNF, IL-17 and NF-κB signaling pathways (Fig. 5h). On the other hand, the ribosome biogenesis
pathway is enriched in the upregulated genes of cluster 2, suggesting an increased need for protein
biogenesis during OC43 replication.
In short, FD-seq revealed that the majority of cells did not express a high level of viral
genes after exposure to OC43, and that these cells upregulated pro-inflammatory genes. These
findings are in agreement with our previous characterization of HSV-1 infection at the single-cell
level21, which showed that most HSV-1 infected cells did not express high levels of viral genes,
and that these abortively-infected cells were the main producers of antiviral gene transcripts and
the initiators of the type I interferon signaling.

DISCUSSION
Here we present FD-seq, a novel method for high-throughput droplet-based RNA sequencing of
PFA-fixed single cells. FD-seq is particularly useful for sequencing rare subpopulations of cells
that require intracellular staining and FACS-enrichment, and for rendering infectious samples safe
for handling. Drop-seq has only been shown to work with methanol fixation9, and we demonstrated
that FD-seq performed better than methanol fixation, with the former detecting more genes and
transcripts. FD-seq will increase the flexibility for researchers in using high throughput scRNAseq, because PFA fixation has also shown to provide a better signal-to-background ratio for certain
intracellular staining targets11,12, and because PFA is a very commonly used alternative to
methanol fixation.
We applied FD-seq to study the process of KSHV lytic reactivation at the single-cell level,
and found that reactivation is very heterogeneous, and that the expression levels of viral genes
correlated poorly with one another. We found four host factors, namely CDH1, CORO1C, ISCU
and TMEM119, to be significantly positively correlated with viral reactivation. Using live-cell
imaging and time-course study, we found TMEM119 to have the most pronounced effect among
the four genes in enhancing the degree of viral reactivation. Bulk RNA-seq suggested that this
effect of TMEM119 could be mediated through the MAPK signaling pathway, in agreement with
previous studies 27,28. More studies are required to investigate in details the mechanisms by which
TMEM119 affects the MAPK signaling pathway and modulates the increase in KSHV reactivation.
Furthermore, we demonstrated a potential application of FD-seq in the COVID-19
pandemic, by using FD-seq to study the host response of human lung cells to OC43, a
betacoronavirus, infection, and the subsequent expression of viral genes at the single-cell level.
First, we infected the cells with the virus, then fixed with PFA, thereby inactivating the virus for

safer sample handling, before analyzing the cells with FD-seq. We showed that most OC43infected cells were unable to support high level of viral gene expression, and instead upregulated
pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. Therefore, these lowly-infected cells are the main producers
of pro-inflammatory gene products, such as cytokines, during OC43 infection in vitro. It would be
very interesting to examine whether a similar phenomenon is observed for SARS-CoV-2 infected
cells, both in vitro and in patient samples. FD-seq would allow researchers to inactivate this
infectious virus with PFA so that they can safely study it in BSL-2 facilities.
Taken together, these biological application of FD-seq show that this method is a valuable
tool for integrating protein activity with transcriptome information. Transcription factor
expression levels and phosphorylation can be integrated with whole transcriptome analysis by
combining intracellular protein staining with FD-seq. Furthermore, FD-seq is compatible with
RNA velocity analysis, which relies on detection of unspliced mRNA molecules33 (Fig. S12). In
future studies, FD-seq could serve as a basis for developing a method for sequencing formalinfixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, due to the similarity between PFA fixation and FFPE.
Such an achievement of which would enable high-throughput single-cell sequencing of readily
available samples in tissue banks.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Microfluidic device fabrication
The microfluidic device was fabricated based on the AutoCAD file provided in Macosko et al.3
The mold was made from SU8-3050 photoresist of 100 µm height. Then, polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS, Momentive RTV615) was cast on the mold to form the microfluidic devices. Plasma
bonding was used to bond the PDMS device to a glass slide, and the microfluidic channels were
coated with Aquapel.
Cell culture
HEK293T (ATCC) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM GlutaMAX (Gibco), and 1% (v/v)
penicillin-streptomycin (P/S, Gibco). HEK293T.rKSHV.219 cells were generated by infecting
HEK293T cells with rKSHV.21924, and selecting with 1 µg/mL puromycin. The KSHV-positive
human PEL cell line BC3 was cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) supplemented
with 20% (v/v) FBS, 2 mM GlutaMAX, and 1% (v/v) P/S. A549 cells (ATCC) or A549 cells with
H2B-Ruby fusion were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, without antibiotics.
The 3T3 cells (p65-/- 3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cells expressing p65-DsRed and H2B-GFP
nucleus marker32) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine calf serum
(HyClone), 1% (v/v) GlutaMAX and 1x P/S.
Optimization of RNA extraction condition for fixed and permeabilized cells
BC3 cells were harvested, centrifuged at 300g for 3 min to remove the cell media, and washed
once with PBS and 1% BSA (molecular biology grade, Gemini Bio-Products). To fix the cells, 4%
PFA in PBS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the cells and incubated at room temperature

for 15 minutes. Next, the paraformaldehyde was discarded, and the cells was washed once with
wash buffer (PBS with 1% BSA and 40 units/ml of RNase inhibitor, murine (NEB)). To
permeabilize the cells, 0.1% Triton X-100 (molecular biology grade, Acros Organics) diluted in
the wash buffer was added to the cells, and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Then,
after adding the wash buffer, cells were pelleted, the supernatant was discarded, and the cells were
wash once more with the wash buffer. To mimic the condition of antibody staining, cells were
resuspended in wash buffer and incubated on ice for 1 hour, washed twice with the wash buffer
and finally kept on ice in the wash buffer before RNA extraction.
To serve as a positive control, RNA from bulk live cells was extracted using the RNeasy
Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen). Cells were first suspended in a combination of the standard Drop-seq lysis
buffer with PBS at equal volume ratio (to make the lysis buffer’s final concentration the same as
that in nanoliter droplets), incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes, and placed on ice for at
least 5 minutes. Next, the cell lysate was combined with 350 µl of RLT plus buffer from the
RNeasy kit, and processed according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
To extract RNA from bulk fixed cells, fixed and permeabilized cells (as described above)
were suspended in a combination of Drop-seq lysis buffer spiked in with various concentrations
of proteinase K (NEB), and PBS at equal volume ratio. Next, the sample was at 56oC for 1 hour,
left at room temperature for 10 minutes, and placed on ice for at least 5 minutes. Finally, the cell
lysate was combined with 350 µl of RLT plus buffer, and processed according to the RNeasy Plus
Mini Kit’s protocol.

Treatment of BC3 cells, flow cytometry and FACS-sorting of reactivated cells
BC3 cells were mock-treated or treated with a final concentration of 20 ng/mL tetradecanoyl
phorbol acetate (TPA, Millipore Sigma) for 36 hours to induce KSHV reactivation. Cells were
pelleted by centrifugation at 300g for 3 min and fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 15 min at room
temperature followed by permeabilization with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS with 1% (w/v)
BSA for 15 min at room temperature. After washing and blocking the cells in PBS supplemented
with 4% BSA, staining was performed with an anti-KSHV K8.1 antibody (sc-65446, Santa Cruz,
1:50 dilution) and an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat-anti-mouse secondary antibody (A10667,
Life Technologies, 1:4000 dilution) in PBS/1% BSA supplemented with RNase inhibitor, murine
(NEB). K8.1-positive and negative cell populations were analyzed on an LSRFortessa flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences) and/or sorted on a FACSAriaIIIu cell sorter (BD Biosciences).
Infection of A549 cells
OC43 (ATCC) were grown and titrated on A549 cells. For FD-seq experiments, A549 cells were
seeded in 6-well plates and infected with OC43 at an MOI of 1 the following day. Cells were
incubated at 33C for 4 days and were subsequently harvested for FD-seq.
FD-seq protocol
The protocol for FD-seq is based on the McCaroll lab’s online Drop-seq protocol3. In summary,
there are only two significant differences: 40 units/ml proteinase K was added to the Drop-seq
lysis, and a heating step was added between the droplet generation and droplet breakage steps.
First, the barcoded beads were suspended at 120,000 beads/ml in a modified Drop-seq lysis buffer:
200 mM Tris pH 7.5, 6% Ficoll type 400, 0.2% Sarkosyl, 20 mM EDTA, 50 mM DTT and 40
units/ml proteinase K (NEB). Cells were suspended in PBS with 0.01% BSA at 100,000 cells/ml.

For droplet generation, the cells, beads and oil were injected at flow rates of 3, 3 and 12 ml/h,
respectively, using syringe pumps. After droplet generation, the droplets were heated on a heat
block at 56oC for 1 hour to reverse the PFA cross-links, then incubated at room temperature for 10
minutes and kept on ice for at least 5 minutes. After this, the droplets were broken, the beads were
collected, washed, and subjected to reverse transcription and exonuclease I digestion as per
standard Drop-seq protocol.
For whole transcriptome amplification (WTA), the beads were distributed into a 96-well
plate such that each well contained 5,000 beads. A 50 ul PCR reaction was set up in each well (1X
KAPA HiFi Hotstart Readymix, 0.8 uM TSO_PCR primer) using the following thermal cycle
program: 95C 3 min; 4 cycles of 98C 20s, 65C 45s, 72C 3 min; 10 cycles of 98C 20s, 67C 20s,
72C 3 min; 72C 5 min; 4C hold. After PCR finishes, the WTA products were cleaned up with 0.6X
Ampure XP beads (Beckman Coulter), pooled and quantified with TapeStation (Agilent).
To prepare the sequencing library, 450pg of WTA products were used for each
tagmentation reaction (Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit, Illumina). First, the WTA products
were incubated with the tagment enzyme at 55C for 5 min. Next, the neutralization buffer was
added, and the sample was incubated at room temperature for 5 min, in order to neutralize the
enzyme. After this, the Nextera PCR Master Mix and custom primers P5-TSO_Hybrid and
Nextera_N70X were added, and the sample was thermocycled as following: 95C 30s; 12 cycles of
95C 10s, 55C 30s, 72C 30s; 72C 5 min; 4C hold. Finally, the tagmentation products were cleaned
up with 0.6X Ampure XP beads and quantified with TapeStation. The sequences of the primers
are given in Table S1.

Methanol fixation experiment
A549 cells were harvested and split into 2 samples of approximately 1 million cells each, one for
PFA fixation and FD-seq, and one for methanol fixation and Drop-seq. PFA fixation was
performed as above. For methanol fixation9, cells were washed once with 1 ml of 1% BSA, then
resuspended in 200 ul of ice-cold PBS. Next, ice-cold 100% methanol was added dropwise into
the cells while gently vortexing the tube, and the cells were incubated on ice for 15 minutes. The
cells were then rehydrated by centrifuging the cells at 1000g for 5 minutes, then discarding the
methanol and washing twice with 1 ml of 0.01% BSA. The rehydrated cells were then counted and
processed according to the standard Drop-seq protocol.
Plasmids and transfections

Reverse transcription and real-time PCR (RT-qPCR)
Total RNA was extracted by using the HP Total RNA Kit (OMEGA Bio-Tek) using
manufacturer’s instructions. RT-qPCR was performed using either a one-step or a two-step
protocol. For the one-step protocol, RT-qPCR were performed with equal amounts (25-500 ng) of
RNA using the SuperScript III Platinum One-Step qRT-PCR kit with ROX (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) on a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR Machine (Applied Biosystems). Premixed master mixes
containing TaqMan primers and probes for each individual gene were purchased from IDT
(GAPDH, TMEM119, CORO1C, ISCU, and CDH1) or Applied Biosystems (18S). For the twostep protocol, reverse transcription was performed using the ProtoScript II First Strand cDNA
Synthesis Kit (NEB) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The kit’s oligo-dT primer was used
as the primer in this step. Next, the RT products were diluted by 20-fold in water, and used as the
input for qPCR (Luna Universal qPCR Master Mix, NEB). The primers’ sequences are given in
Table S2. Relative expression level of each target gene was calculated by normalizing for GAPDH
or 18S levels using the Comparative Ct Method (ΔΔCt Method) and presented relative to the
control sample.
Live-cell imaging experiments
HEK293T.rKSHV were seeded in 24-well plates and transfected with plasmids for overexpression or siRNA for knock-down experiments. Cells were then imaged on a Nikon Ti-Eclipse
containing an environmental chamber (37C, 100% humidity, 5% CO2). Images were acquired
every 4 hours for 4 days.

Total RNA was extracted from cells with the HP Total RNA Kit as above and quantified using
NanoDrop. mRNA was isolated from 100 ng of total RNA per sample using oligo dT magnetic
beads (NEB) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The isolated mRNA was then used to
prepare sequencing libraries using NEBNext Ultra II Non-directional RNA Library Prep Kit for
Illumina and NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina (Index sets 1 and 2) (NEB). Next, the
sequencing libraries were quantified using High Sensitivity Fragment Analyzer (Agilent),
normalized to 30 nM, pooled at equimolar, and sequenced with NextSeq High-output kit (singleread 75 bp).
Sequencing and alignment
Drop-seq and FD-seq libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq 550 machine with the following read
distribution: 20 bp for read 1, 60 bp for read 2, and 8 bp for index 1 read. The custom read 1
sequencing primer Read1CustomSeqB was used in place of Illumina’s read 1 primer (Table S1).
Alignment was performed using Picard version 2.21.8 (https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard)
and Drop-seq tools version 1.13 or version 2.3. The valid cell barcodes were chosen using the
“knee plot” method. Bulk RNA-seq libraries were sequenced on a NextSeq 550 machine with the
following read distribution: 75 bp for read 1, and 6 bp for index 1 read. Alignment was performed
using STAR aligner (version 2.7.3a) and counted using featureCounts. Alignment was performed
to a concatenated version of the human genome GRCh38 and OC43 genome NC_006213.129.
Read subsampling and read mapping
In the FD-seq and methanol fixation comparison experiment, we used samtools view command34
to subsample the output BAM file from Drop-seq tools version 2.3 DetectBeadSynthesisErrors

scRNA-seq data analysis
Data analysis was done using R packages Monocle 235–37q and Seurat 338,39. Data visualization was
done using R and Python. For species mixing data, a cell is classified as human or mouse if more
than 90% of the detected transcripts are mapped to human or mouse, respectively. dropEst
pipeline40 was used with argument –L eiEIBA to annotate reads mapping to exon, intron or
exon/intron spanning regions.
For the FD-seq and methanol fixation comparison experiment, we first discarded cells with
lower than 1,000 UMIs and genes detected in fewer than 5 cells. We then used Seurat 3 to lognormalize and scale the data. To calculate the technical variance, we normalized the UMI count
by converting it to UMIs per million, then randomly chose 400 cells from each fixation method
and used the 1,000 most highly expressed non-mitochondrial genes to calculate the mean and
squared coefficient of variation.
For the KSHV reactivation experiment, we first discarded cells with more than 3,000 genes
detected, and cells with fewer than 1,000 UMIs or more than 10,000 UMIs. Then we discarded
genes detected in fewer than 5 cells. To find the relative expression of each gene, we first
normalized the cells using Monocle 2. To cluster the cells, we first performed dimension reduction
with t-SNE using the first 4 principal components, then clustered the cells by setting rho_threshold
= 17 and delta_threshold = 11. We then set the percentage of viral transcripts as the pseudotime

parameter, and performed a “pseudotime analysis” in order to find genes correlated with the
abundance of viral transcripts.
For the OC43 infection experiment, we discarded cells with fewer than 1,000 UMIs or
more than 20,000 UMIs. We then discarded genes detected in fewer than 5 cells. We then used
Seurat 3 to remove the cell cycle effects, normalize and scale the data. To cluster the cells, we used
the first 10 principal components for the FindNeighbors and RunTSNE functions, and
resolution=0.2 for the FindClusters function. To find the cluster markers, we used min.pct=0.25
and logfc.threshold=0.25 for the FindAllMarkers function.
Bulk RNA-seq data analysis
Bulk RNA-seq data was analyzed using the R package DESeq241. To find the enriched KEGG
pathways, we uploaded the list of genes that were upregulated in TMEM119 overexpression versus
GFP overexpression (log2 fold change > 1, FDR < 0.05) to g:Profiler26.
RNA velocity analysis
The output files of Drop-seq tools DetectBeadSynthesisErrors function were processed with the
dropEst pipeline40 to tag spliced and unspliced transcripts, and the results were analyzed with
Python velocyto package33.
Data availability
The raw data, metadata and count data are deposited in NBCI’s Gene Expression Omnibus
(accession number GSE156988).
