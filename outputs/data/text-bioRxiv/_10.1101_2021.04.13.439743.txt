Abstract
Structural and biochemical studies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike complexes with highly potent
antibodies have revealed multiple conformation-dependent epitopes and a broad range of
recognition modes linked to different neutralization responses In this study, we combined
atomistic simulations with mutational and perturbation-based scanning approaches to perform
in silico profiling of binding and allosteric propensities of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
residues in complexes with B38, P2B-2F6, EY6A and S304 antibodies representing

three

different classes. Conformational dynamics analysis revealed that binding-induced modulation
of soft modes can elicit the unique protein response to different classes of antibodies. Mutational
scanning heatmaps and sensitivity analysis revealed the binding energy hotspots for different
classes of antibodies that are consistent with the experimental deep mutagenesis, showing that
differences in the binding affinity caused by global circulating variants in spike positions K417,
E484 and N501 are relatively moderate and may not fully account for the observed antibody
resistance effects. Through functional dynamics analysis and perturbation-response scanning of
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein residues in the unbound form and antibody-bound forms, we
examine how antibody binding can modulate allosteric propensities of spike protein residues
and determine allosteric hotspots that control signal transmission and global conformational
changes. These results show that residues K417, E484, and N501 targeted by circulating
mutations

correspond to a group of versatile allosteric centers in which small perturbations

can modulate collective motions, alter

the global allosteric response and elicit binding

resistance. We suggest that SARS-CoV-2 S protein may exploit plasticity of specific allosteric
hotspots to

generate escape mutants that

alter response to antibody binding without

compromising activity of the spike protein.

Introduction
The structural and biochemical studies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoproteins and
complexes with highly potent antibodies

have revealed

multiple conformation-dependent

epitopes highlighting the link between conformational plasticity of spike proteins and capacity
for eliciting specific binding and broad neutralization responses.1-7 The potent antibodies often
compete and interfere with the mechanism of virus infection
conformational transformations of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein

that features spontaneous
between closed “down” and

open “up” forms of the receptor-binding domain (RBD).7-9 A general mechanism of population
shifts between different functional states of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimers suggested that RBD
epitopes can become stochastically exposed to the interactions with the host receptor ACE,
leading to the increased population of open S-RBD states priming spike protein for fusion
activation.10-16 The initial structure of SARS-CoV-RBD complex with a neutralizing antibody
80R showed that the epitope on the S1 RBD overlapped closely with the ACE2-binding site,
suggesting that a direct interference mechanism

may be responsible for the neutralizing

However, several SARS-CoV–specific neutralizing antibodies such as m396, 80R,

and F26G19 that block the RBM motif in the open S conformation did not exhibit a strong
neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 protein.
antibodies

A wide spectrum

of SARS-CoV-2

can be divided into several main classes of which class I and class II antibodies

target epitopes that target the receptor binding motif (RBM) region of the RBD.4-6

Class I is

the largest group of structurally characterized monoclonal antibodies against the SARSCoV-2 SRBD that exhibit a significant overlap with the ACE2 epitope and bind when the RBD is in
the open “up” state. Structural and biochemical studies characterized the binding epitopes and
molecular mechanisms for a number of

class I SARS-CoV-2 antibodies

demonstrated

SARS-CoV-2 antibodies B38 and H4

can bind simultaneously to different epitopes on RBD such that both antibodies together confer
a stronger neutralizing effect than either antibody individually. Structural analysis showed that
B38 binding

epitope

spans 36 residues on the RBD of which 15 are conserved between

SARS-Cov-2 and SARS-CoV and reside within the ACE2 binding interface.19 Some of the
known escaping mutations are within the epitopes for the neutralizing antibody B38 (K458R,
D405V).24

A new SARS-CoV-2 lineage (501Y.V2) first detected in South Africa is

characterized by 21 mutations with 8 lineage-defining mutations in the S protein, including
three at important RBD residues (K417N, E484K and N501Y) that have functional significance
and often induce significant immune escape.25,26 The latest analysis of 17 class I antibody
structures confirmed conservation of their conformational epitopes centered on RBD residue
K417 which is one of three substitutions in the RBD of the circulating mutation of 501Y.V2
lineage.27
pseudovirus

The antibodies potently neutralized the original lineage, but not the 501Y.V2
revealing a strong dependence on the K417 residue.

Class II neutralizing

antibodies P2B-2F628, BD-368-222, CV07-270,29 S2H1330, and C1216 revealed the epitopes that
only partially overlap with the ACE2 binding site and, as a result, these antibodies can bind to
the S-RBD in both up and down conformation.

The potential neutralization mechanisms for

class II are more diverse and can include blocking ACE2 from binding and also inducing S1
domain shedding by trapping the RBDs in the up state. Structural comparison of 15 class II
antibodies revealed key interactions with residue E484, showing most of these antibodies can
be evaded by 501Y.V2 RBD variant that prominently featured E484K mutation.27 Crystal

structure of the S-RBD complex with P2B-2F6 revealed only moderate steric hindrance with
the ACE2 binding site and partial interference with viral engagement with ACE2 recepotor.28
Of 12 RBM contacts, only four residues (N448, G447, Y449, and N450) are conserved in
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV proteins while the only common residues recognized by both
P2B-2F6 and ACE2 are G446 and Y449. Despite a small number of key overlapping residues,
similar high binding affinities of P2B-2F6 and ACE2 binding suggest that they compete for the
RBD interactions.28 Recently, the crystal structures of several other related antibodies P2C-1F11
and P2C-1A3 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD were determined, showing instructive differences
in the angles of antibody approach the RBD and highlighting common and unique binding
residues on the S-RBD.31 Of special interest, one antibody, P2C-1F11 that most closely mimics
binding of receptor ACE2, displays the most potent neutralizing activity in vitro and
demonstrates the highest binding affinity to RBD. Functional studies showed that F490L, V483A
an L452R mutations can reduce considerably sensitivity to P2B2F6 antibody.24 Analysis of the
molecular determinants and mechanisms of mutational escape showed that SARS-CoV-2 virus
rapidly escapes from individual antibodies but doesn’t easily escape from the cocktail due to
stronger evolutionary constraints on RBD-ACE2 interaction and RBD protein folding.32
Class III antibodies including CR302233-35 EY6A36, and S30430 bind to the opposite face of
the RBD targeting the cryptic epitope that is only accessible when at least two RBDs are in the
up state.

Structural and surface plasmon resonance studies confirmed that CR3022 binds the

RBD of SARS-CoV-2

displaying strong neutralization by allosterically perturbing the

interactions between the RBD regions and ACE2 receptor.34

The neutralization mechanism of

SARS-CoV-2 through destabilization of the prefusion S conformation can provide a resistance
mechanism to virus escape

which can be contrasted with class I antibodies

for the ACE2-binding site and often susceptible to immune evasion. EY6A

antibody binds to the same cryptic epitope as CR3022 but exploit a different orientation with
respect to the S-RBD corresponding to a 73° rotation around an axis perpendicular to the RBD
α3-helix.36 Interestingly, EY6A binding to the isolated RBD is an order of magnitude better
than CR3022 and the unique binding mode allows three EY6A molecules

to bind

simultaneously around the central axis of the S protein.36 The antibodies isolated from 10
convalescent COVID-19 patients showed neutralizing activities against authentic SARS-CoV-2,
with 4A8 antibody binding to the NTD of the S protein conformation with one RBD in “up”
conformation and the other two RBDs in “down” conformation.37 Potent neutralizing antibodies
from COVID-19 patients examined through electron microscopy studies confirmed that the
SARS-CoV-2 S protein features multiple distinct antigenic sites, including RBD-based and
non-RBD epitopes.38 Cryo–EM characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 S trimer in complex with
the H014 Fab fragment revealed a new conformational epitope that is accessible only when the
RBD is in the up conformation.39 Biochemical and virological studies demonstrated that H014
prevents attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to the host cell receptors and can exhibit broad crossneutralization activities by leveraging conserved nature of the RBD epitope and a partial overlap
with ACE2-binding region. The recently reported S309 antibody potently neutralizes both
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV through binding to a conserved RBD epitope which is distinct
from the RBM region and accessible in both open and closed states, so that there is no
completion between S309 and ACE2 for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein.40 Two ultrapotent Abs S2M11 and S2E12 targeting the overlapping RBD epitopes were recently reported,
revealing antibody-specific modulation

and adaptation of different

functional states for the S trimer.41 Cryo-EM structures showed that S2M11 can recognize and

stabilize S protein in the closed conformation by binding to a quaternary epitope spanning two
RBDs of the adjacent protomers in the S trimer, while S2E12 binds to a tertiary epitope
contained within one S protomer and shifts the conformational equilibrium towards a fully open
S trimer conformation.

The emerging body of studies suggested that properly designed

antibody cocktails can provide a broad and efficient cross- neutralization effects

through

synergistic targeting of conserved and more variable SARS-CoV-2 RBD epitopes, thereby
offering a robust strategy to combat virus resistance. These studies also suggested that several
potent antibodies may function by allosterically interfering with the host receptor binding and
causing conformational changes in the S protein that can obstruct other epitopes and block
virus infection without directly interfering with ACE2 recognition.
Biochemical and functional studies

using a protein engineering and deep mutagenesis have

quantified binding mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 interactions with the host receptor.42,43 Deep
mutational scanning of SARS-CoV-2 RBD revealed mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 interactions
with the host receptor showing that many mutations of the RBD residues can be well tolerated
with respect to both folding and binding. A number of amino acid modifications could even
improve ACE2 binding, including important binding interface positions that enhance RBD
expression (V367F and G502D) or enhance ACE2 affinity (N501F, N501T, and Q498Y).42
Functional studies

characterized the key amino acid residues of the RBD for binding with

human ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies, revealing two groups of amino acid residues that
modulate binding, where the SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations in positions N439, L452, T470,
E484, Q498 and N501 can result in the enhanced binding affinity for ACE2.44

Interestingly,

residues E484 and F486 in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD were identified as important sites for the
recognition and differential binding ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies, indicating that structural

plasticity of

the RBM residues may

induce mutational escape

from the RBD-targeting

neutralizing antibodies. Functional mapping of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD using
deep mutational scanning showed that escape sites from antibodies can be constrained to ensure
proper expression of the folded RBD, suggesting that escape-resistant antibody cocktails can
compete for binding to the same RBD

region but have different escape mutations.45

Comprehensive mapping of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralization assay
experiments indicated that E484 modifications can reduce the neutralization potency by some
antibodies by >10 fold.47-51 REGN10933 and REGN10987 are escaped by different mutations as
mutation at F486 escaped neutralization only by REGN10933, whereas mutations at K444
escaped neutralization only by REGN10987, while only a single mutation E406W escaped the
REGN-COV2 cocktail (REG10987+REG10933).49,50 These studies indicated that mutations in
the epitope centered around E484 position (G485, F486, F490) or in the 443–455 loop (K444,
V445, L455, F456 sites) strongly affected neutralization for different classes of antibodies. By
combining biophysical experiments with crystallographic studies, the binding epitopes for 80
monoclonal antibodies that bind the RBD was determined.52 The resulting map shows the
antibody footprints forming five major epitopes by cluster analysis, particularly highlighting the
role residues E484–F486

that bridge the epitopes and are accessible

to antibodies from

different approaching angles of attack. Notably, mutations in these positions E484K and F486L
were identified as recurrent mutations identified in the B.1.351 and P.1 lineages.53,54

increases ACE2 binding affinity, and may impact the collective dynamics of the ACE2-RBD
complex while mutations K417N and E484K reduce the ACE2-binding affinity.68
In this study, we combined MD simulations with mutational and perturbation-based scanning
approaches to perform a

comprehensive structural profiling of binding and allosteric

propensities of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD residues in complexes with three different classes of
antibodies. We investigated dynamics, energetics and allosteric potential of the S-RBD protein
in complexes with B38, P2B-2F6, EY6A and S304 antibodies. The mutational scanning-based
heatmaps reveal the binding energy hotspots for different classes of antibodies indicating that
differences in the binding affinity caused by global variants are moderate and are unlikely

to

fully account for the antibody resistance effects. Through functional dynamics analysis and
perturbation-response scanning of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD in the unbound form and antibodybound forms, we characterize allosteric propensities of spike protein residues and determine
regulatory sites that may function as allosteric hotspots of long-range communications. These
results

show

that

residues K417, E484, and N501 targeted by circulating mutations

correspond to a group of allosteric centers involved in a coordinated cross-talk to enable
antibody-induced modulation of the spike activity. Using different classes of antibodies, we
show that

mutational variants constrained by the requirements for preservation of the RBD

stability may preferentially target a group of structurally adaptable allosteric centers in which
small perturbations can modulate functional motions, alter the global allosteric response and
elicit binding resistance. We suggest that SARS-CoV-2 S protein may exploit plasticity of
specific allosteric hotspots to generate escape mutants that alter response to antibody binding
without compromising activity of the spike protein.

MD Simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD Complexes with Antibodies
All-atom MD simulations were performed for an N, P, T ensemble in explicit solvent using
NAMD 2.13 package77 with CHARMM36 force field.78 Long-range non-bonded van der Waals
interactions were computed using an atom-based cutoff of 12 Å with switching van der Waals
potential beginning at 10 Å. Long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the
particle mesh Ewald method79 with a real space cut-off of 1.0 nm and a fourth order (cubic)
interpolation. SHAKE method was used to constrain all bonds associated with hydrogen atoms.
Simulations were run using a leap-frog integrator with a 2 fs integration time step. Energy
minimization after addition of solvent and ions was carried out using the steepest descent method
for 100,000 steps. All atoms of the complex were first restrained at their crystal structure
positions with a force constant of 10 Kcal mol-1 Å-2. Equilibration was done in steps by gradually
increasing the system temperature in steps of 20K starting from 10K until 310 K and at each step
1ns equilibration was done keeping a restraint of 10 Kcal mol-1 Å-2 on the protein Cα atoms.
After the restrains on the protein atoms were removed, the system was equilibrated for
additional 10 ns. An NPT production simulation was run on the equilibrated structures for 500
ns keeping the temperature at 310 K and constant pressure (1 atm). In simulations, the Nose–
Hoover thermostat80 and isotropic Martyna–Tobias–Klein barostat81 were used to maintain the
temperature at 310 K and pressure at 1 atm respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) of

surface area (SASA) of that residue observed in a given structure and the maximum attainable
value of the solvent-exposed surface area for this residue using web server GetArea. 83

Distance Fluctuations Stability Analysis
Using a protein mechanics-based approach84,85 we employed distance fluctuation analysis of
the simulation trajectories to profile antibody-induced modulation of stability for the SARSCoV-2 S-RBD residues. We computed the fluctuations of the mean distance between each atom
within a given residue and the atoms that belong to the remaining residues of the protein. The
fluctuations of the mean distance between a given residue and all other residues in the ensemble
were converted into distance fluctuation stability indexes that measure the energy cost of
residue deformation during simulations.

the

The high values of distance fluctuation indexes are

associated with stable residues that display small fluctuations in their distances to all other
residues, while small values of this stability parameter would point to more flexible sites that
experience large deviations of their inter-residue distances. The distance fluctuation stability
index for each residue is calculated by averaging the distances between the residues over the
simulation trajectory using the following expression:

denotes an average taken over the MD simulation trajectory and di = dij

j*

is

the average distance from residue i to all other atoms j in the protein (the sum over j* implies
the exclusion of the atoms that belong to the residue i ). The interactions between the Cα atom
of residue i and the Cα atom of the neighboring residues i -1 and i +1 are excluded in the
calculation since the corresponding distances are nearly constant.

The inverse of these

fluctuations yields an effective force constant ki that describes the ease of moving an atom with
respect to the protein structure.

Mutational Scanning
To compute protein stability changes in the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD complexes, we conducted
mutational sensitivity scanning of protein residues by systematically exploring all possible
substitutions.

BeAtMuSiC

approach was employed that is based on statistical potentials

describing the pairwise inter-residue distances, backbone torsion angles and solvent
accessibilities, and considers the effect of the mutation on the strength of the interactions at the
interface and on the overall stability of the complex.86

The binding free energy of protein-

protein complex can be expressed as the difference in the folding free energy of the complex
and folding free energies of the two protein binding partners:

We leveraged rapid calculations

based on statistical potentials to compute the ensemble-

averaged binding free energy changes using equilibrium samples from MD trajectories. The
binding free energy changes were computed by averaging the results over 1,000 equilibrium
samples for each of the studied systems.

Perturbation Response Scanning
Perturbation Response Scanning (PRS) approach87-89 follows the protocol originally proposed by
Bahar and colleagues90,91

and was described in detail in our previous studies.92,93 In brief,

through monitoring the response to forces on the protein residues, the PRS approach can
quantify allosteric couplings and determine the protein response in functional movements. In
this approach, it 3N × 3N Hessian matrix 𝑯𝑯 whose elements represent second derivatives of the
potential at the local minimum connect the perturbation forces to the residue displacements. The
3N-dimensional vector 𝚫𝚫𝑹𝑹 of node displacements in response to 3N-dimensional perturbation

force follows Hooke’s law 𝑭𝑭 = 𝑯𝑯 ∗ 𝜟𝜟𝜟𝜟. A perturbation force is applied to one residue at a time,
and the response of the protein system is measured by the displacement vector ∆𝑹𝑹(𝑖𝑖) = 𝑯𝑯−𝟏𝟏 𝑭𝑭(𝒊𝒊)

that is then translated into N×N PRS matrix. The second derivatives matrix 𝑯𝑯 is obtained from
simulation trajectories for each protein structure, with residues represented by 𝐶𝐶𝛼𝛼 atoms and the

deviation of each residue from an average structure was calculated by ∆𝐑𝐑𝑗𝑗 (𝑡𝑡) = 𝐑𝐑𝑗𝑗 (𝑡𝑡) −
〈𝐑𝐑𝑗𝑗 (𝑡𝑡)〉, and corresponding covariance matrix C was then calculated by ∆𝐑𝐑∆𝐑𝐑𝑇𝑇 .

We

sequentially perturbed each residue in the SARS-CoV-2 spike structures by applying a total of
250 random forces to each residue to mimic a sphere of randomly selected directions.62 The
displacement changes, ∆𝑹𝑹𝒊𝒊 is a 3N-dimensional vector describing the linear response of the
protein and deformation of all the residues.

Using the residue displacements upon multiple external force perturbations, we compute the
magnitude of the response of residue k as

ΔR (ik )

averaged over multiple perturbation forces

F(i), yielding the ikth element of the N×N PRS matrix. The average effect of the perturbed
effector site 𝑖𝑖 on all other residues is computed by averaging over all sensors (receivers) residues

of a given residue node on the perturbations in other protein residues and can be used as proxy

of the PRS matrix describes the sensitivity profile of sensor residue j in response to
perturbations of all residues and its average is denoted as 〈(∆𝑹𝑹𝒊𝒊 )2 〉𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 .

The sensor profile

Results and Discussion
Dynamic Signatures of the SARS-CoV-2 S RBD

Are Uniquely Modulated by Different

Classes of Antibodies
Using MD simulations, we examined how SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can exploit plasticity of
the RBD regions to modulate specific dynamic responses to antibody binding. MD simulations of
the RBD-antibody complexes revealed functionally important modulation of the conformational
dynamics and appreciable redistribution of the S-RBD stability profiles. The RBD core remained
stable during while mobility of some flexible regions could be significant altered (Figure 2).
Instructively, the largest binding-induced dynamic changes were seen in the S-RBD complex
with B38, exemplified by significant stabilization of flexible residues around K417 site (Figure
2A). An appreciable modulation of the S-RBD mobility was also seen in the loop region

(residues 457-480) and RBM ridge (residues 490-505) that display moderate thermal fluctuations
in the complex (Figure 2A). The strategic functional positions K417 and N501 are stabilized in
the RBD-B38 complex, but residues around E484 position are noticeably more flexible (Figure
2A).

The distribution of the distinct inter-molecular residue pairs revealed antibody contacts

with a wide range of residues including D420, K417, Y421, K458, G476, D427, F486, Y489,
Q498,

N501, Y505 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Supporting Information, Figure S1A). In

particular, K417 forms hydrophilic interactions with Y33, N92, Y52, Y58 and Y97 of B38.
Another important site N501 is involved in multiple interactions with various B38 residues of
the light chain (Q27, S30, G28,Q 27, I29). Notably, most interactions at the RBD-B38
interface are hydrophilic formed by K417, D403, D420, K458, and Q498 residues. A number of
the inter-residue contact pairs are mediated through interactions of hydrophobic hotspots F456,
F486, and Y489 (Supporting Information, Figure S1A). A similar dynamic pattern was detected
in the S-RBD complex with class II P2B-2F6 antibody that binds to the RBM region using a
different recognition angle with the binding epitope centered on G446/Y449 and E484/F490
residues (Figure 2B). These key epitope residues showed modest thermal fluctuations and were
stabilized in the complex, but the overall mobility of the S-RBD was greater as compared the
RBD-B38 complex. The inter-residue interaction pairs are formed with V445, G446, and Y449
site (Supporting Information, Figure S2B). In particular Y449 residue is involved in numerous
contacts with Y27, V104, G32, S31, Y33, and G102 of heavy chain of B38. Of special notice
also a number of the inter-residue pair contacts made by E484, F486, and F490 residues
(Supporting Information, Figure S1B). E484 forms hydrogen bonds with N33 and Y34 of the
P2B-2F6 light chain and with R112 of the P2B-2F6 heavy chain.

The class III antibodies EY6A and S304

bind to the cryptic epitope and exhibited a

characteristic dynamics profile showing a considerable stabilization of the antibody-interacting
residues and further rigidification of the RBD core (Figure 2C,D). In comparison, one
moderately flexible region corresponded to the 444–451 and 456-460 loops, and another peak
of

the distribution was in the exposed region (residues 480-486) from the tip of the RBM

loop (Figure 2C,D).
In this context, it is worth noting that mutations in the epitope centered around E484 position
(G485, F486, F490) or in the 443–455 loop (K444, V445, L455, F456) can strongly affect
neutralization and trigger resistance for

various classes of antibodies, but are less detrimental

for binding of EY6A and S304 antibodies where such mutations may be more

readily

accommodated.36 Notably, this class of antibodies may not only promote further stabilization of
the RBD core but could also modulate mobility of the RBM region. As a result, even though
EY6A binding does not impose steric hindrance on interactions with ACE2 (Figure 1F), by
differentially modulating stability of the RBM residues EY6A may

allosterically induce a

weak inhibitory effect on binding with the host receptor.36
A similar distribution of the inter-residue pairs can be mediated by EY6A and S304 antibodies.
For EY6A, the large numbers of contacts are established by G381, V382, S383, P384, T385,
and K386 residues that form the core of the binding epitope (Supporting Information, Figure
S1C). A less dense network of contacts is maintained by S304 antibody in the complex,
featuring C379, G381, V382, and S383 RBD residues forming contacts with distinct positions
on both heavy and light chains (Supporting Information, Figure S1D).

We compared profiles for the unbound SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD form with the respective
distributions in the antibody-bound states to determine how binding modulates conformational
mobility of the S-RBD residues. Using the ensemble-based distance fluctuations analysis of the
unbound SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD we first identified intrinsically structurally stable regions and
characterize dynamic signatures of the binding epitopes (Supporting Information, Figure S2).
The analysis highlighted several important “islands” of structural stability that are primarily
located in the RBD core. The distribution showed clear peaks corresponding to the conserved
RBD core consisting of antiparallel β strands (β1 to β4 and β7) (residues 354-358, 376-380,
394-403, 431-438, 507-516). Noticeably, the

β-sheets β5 and β6 (residues 451-454 and 492-

495) that anchor the RBM region to the central core also featured high values of the stability
index. A number of structurally stable RBD residues corresponded to evolutionary conserved
positions including C336, R355, C361, F374, F377, C379, L387, C391, D398, G413, N422,
Y423, L425, F429, C432, and W436 (Supporting Information, Figure S2).

The distance

fluctuation stability profile suggested a moderate stability of K417 site, while E484 and N501
positions featured very small index values indicative of high mobility in the free form. By
mapping the binding epitope residues for studied antibodies onto distance fluctuation profile of
the S-RBD, we evaluated the intrinsic dynamic preferences of the binding interfaces (Supporting
Information, Figure S2). The large binding epitope for B38 featured stable segments (residues
403-421, 453-460) as well as more flexible region (residues 473-480) (Supporting Information,
Figure S2A). Interestingly, the binding epitopes for EY6A and S304 antibodies targeting the
conserved RBD core

included moderately stable RBD residues, and only residues F377 and

F429 were aligned with the

local maxima of the profile (Supporting Information, Figure

S2C,D).

The distance fluctuation stability profiles for the S-RBD complexes with antibodies revealed
how binding can induce changes in the distribution of rigid and flexible regions (Figure 3). In the
complex with B38 antibody, one could notice a significant stabilization of the RBM residues
involved in the binding interactions (Figure 3A). In particular, functional sites K417 and N501
become considerably more stable while E484 residue retained relatively high mobility present in
the unbound RBD form. Despite the overlap of the binding epitopes for B38 and P2B-2F6
antibodies that target the RBM region, the stability profiles for these complexes featured several
specific signatures (Figure 3B).

The distance fluctuation profile for the P2B-2F6 complex

pointed to a moderate mobility of K417 and N501 sites, while revealing a markedly increased
stabilization of highly mobile region centered on E484 in the RBM region (Figure 3B). The
distributions for class III EY6A and S304 antibodies were quite similar due to very similar
binding mode and interactions targeting the cryptic binding site (Figure 3C,D). Of particular
notice are pronounced and sharp peaks associated with the conserved residues in the RBD core
that become largely rigid in the complexes. On the other hand, these antibodies induced a more
significant mobility in the RBM regions (residues 470-490). Notably, functional sites K417,
E484 and N501 displayed relatively low values of the stability index (Figure 3C,D). In addition,
we noticed a more radical segregation of highly stable and flexible regions in these complexes
where the rigidity of the RBD core residues can be contrasted with mobility of the RBM
residues. Overall, this analysis indicated that different classes of antibodies could differentially
modulate stability of the S-RBD residues. Moreover, binding of these antibodies can uniquely
specify dynamic signatures of functional regions targeted by global mutational variants.

We specifically mapped stable spike residues that

form local modular clusters

in the

structures of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD complexes with antibodies (Figure 4). These structurally
stable residues in the complex with class I B38 antibody connect the peripheral spike regions
through the RBD core to the binding interface (Figure 4A). Moreover, the functional sites
K417, N501 and E484 appeared to form a network of intermolecular bridges that link the
stable RBD core with the antibody. Interestingly, although P2B-2F6 interactions with S-RBD
are centered on E484 site, these interactions are fairly isolated and separated from the dense
clusters of stable residues of the RBD core (Figure 4B). In this complex, N501 residue provided
the link between stable RBD clusters and the inter-molecular interface. For class III antibody
EY6A, the binding interface is linked with the stable RBD core, illustrating the observed
rigidification of these regions (Figure 4C). Functional centers of K417 and N501 are directly
linked to these stable clusters suggesting that these positions could sense the antibody-induced
signal and alter their dynamics as a part of protein response.
To enhance this dynamics-based analysis, we also employed the conformational ensemble to
compute the relative solvent accessibility (RSA) ratio in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD complexes.
This parameter

was obtained by averaging the SASA computations over the simulation

trajectories (Figure 5).

Of particular interest were the average RSA values for functional sites

K417, E484, and N501 that are residues targeted by circulating mutations. Interestingly, B38 and
P2B-2F6 antibodies yielded a different pattern of RSA for these sites. For B38-RBD complex,
we observed that K417 and N501 positions are buried featuring RSA < 10% (Figure 5A), while
E484 position is largely solvent-exposed.

In the complex with P2B-2F6, both N501 and

especially E484 become > 80% buried (RSA< 20%) while K417 site remained partly exposed
to solvent (Figure 5B).

This class of antibodies revealed key interactions with residue E484, showing most of these
antibodies

can be evaded by 501Y.V2 RBD variant

that prominently featured E484K

mutation.27 Because EY6A and S304 antibodies target the cryptic site located away from the
RBD regions, the functional sites K417 and E484 were mostly exposed with N501 only
moderately buried (Figure 5C,D). It should be pointed out that surrounding residues in this RBM
ridge (T500, V503, G504, and T505) are completely exposed featuring RSA values between
65% and 80% . Hence, different classes of antibodies may induce distinct patterns of solvent
accessibility in the functional positions subjected to circulating mutations.

Binding-Induced Modulation of

Soft Collective Modes Determines Unique Protein

Responses to Different Antibody Classes
We also characterized collective motions for the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD complexes averaged
over low frequency modes using principal component analysis (PCA) of the MD trajectories
(Figure 6). It is worth noting that the local minima along these profiles are typically aligned
with the immobilized in global motions hinge centers, while the maxima correspond to the
moving regions undergoing concerted movements leading to global changes in structure.95 The
low-frequency ‘soft modes’ are characterized by their cooperativity, functional significance and
robustness whereby there is a strong relationship between allosterically-driven conformational
changes and the ‘soft’ modes of motions intrinsically accessible to folded structures.95.96 It is
well established that allosteric responses in proteins can be efficiently triggered when external
stimuli (such as mutations, ligand or antibody binding) can exploit the intrinsic protein
propensities for energetically favorable movement along the slow modes.96 In general, allosteric
effects often arise when the pre-existing slow modes can be altered upon ligand binding. As a

result, when antibody binding to the S-RBD protein target flexible regions near E484 and N501
positions, this may elicit functionally relevant and cooperative allosteric response and change
functional motions of the spike protein. Our analysis is particularly instructive when the slow
mode profiles of the S-RBD are compared between the unbound and bound spike forms. In the
unbound S-RBD form the profile featured a very pronounced

density peak centered on

E484/F486 residues and a next peak around position N501 (Figure 6). At the same time, another
functional site K417 was located near a relatively shallow maximum along this profile. This
suggested that sites of circulating mutations belong to the functional regions

undergoing

concerted motions along pre-existing slow modes of the spike protein. Interestingly, none of the
functional positions targeted by novel mutational variants that promote infectivity and antibody
resistance (K417, E484, and N501) corresponded to hinge positions in the unbound RBD form.
Hence, targeting

these regions by antibodies could potentially change the spectrum of slow

modes and induce specific functional motions characteristic for different antibody classes.

Indeed, for the class I B38 antibody whose binding mode is centered on K417 region, the global
mobility distribution was markedly altered, showing how binding can shifty the location of
major hinge sites (Figure 6A). We noted that B38 binding did not affect hinge residues in the
RBD core as residues Y351, F374, and G404 were aligned with the local minima of the profile.
At the same time, the slow mode profile for the complex revealed local minima near K417,
E484 and N501 residues (Figure 6A). Moreover, the entire moving region of the unbound from
(residues 472-486) becomes mostly restricted in the global dynamics of the complexed SARSCoV-2 RBD (Figure 6A).

This indicated a substantial redistribution of stable hinge site

positions where all three sites targeted by circulating mutations become recruited to the pool of

hinge sites and regulatory centers in the S-RBD protein. As a result, these functional positions
may be involved in a cooperative cross-talk with each other and other conserved hinges located
away from the ACE2 binding site. We argue that B38-induced changes in collective dynamics
could strengthen both binding interactions and allosteric communications in the complex. On the
flipped side, mutations in the triad K417/E484/N401 may not only affect local binding
interactions but would also alter the allosteric response of moving positions that are sensitive
to the specific perturbation, leading to changes in global dynamics and compromising antibodyinduced allosteric response. In this context it is particularly interesting to compare our
observations with functional studies

showing that E484K/N501Y/K417N mutations in the

501Y.V2 lineage confer neutralization escape from class I of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.27

In the complex with class II antibody P2B-2F6,
E484 and S494 residues (Figure 6B).

the hinge sites are aligned with Y449, S469,

A deep global minimum is centered on Y449 residue

which is the key position of the P2B-2F6 binding epitope within the crevice formed by the
RBM-hairpin. Moreover, E484 residue is now aligned with a local hinge position and K417
belongs to a shallow minimum, while N501 peak is aligned with the respective peak in the
unbound state (Figure 6B). Our analysis indicated that G446, Y449 and E484 anchoring
positions are critical for functional motions in the complex and mutations in these sites could
alter binding to P2B-2F6 antibody. Unlike sites of circulating mutations, modifications in
positions G446, Y4459 could compromise binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with both ACE2 and
the antibody. At the same time, mutations in E484 would likely have severe effect on antibody
recognition and functional motions.

A completely different pattern was seen in the collective dynamics profiles of SARS-CoV-2
RBD complexes with EY6A and S304 antibodies targeting the cryptic site (Figure 6C,D). The
hinge centers in the RBD core that are intrinsic for the unbound form were prominently present
in the profiles of these complexes, particularly pointing to cluster of residues 381-386 and 427432. These stable RBD core positions become immobilized due to additional stabilizing contacts
and form the regulatory control center of functional movements in the complexes (Figure 6C,D).
Interestingly, the slow mode profiles for these complexes are very similar to the distributions
seen for the unbound S-RBD, suggesting that binding to the cryptic site may only moderately
affect functional motions of the spike protein. Furthermore, the positions of functional sites
K417, E484 and N501 on the slow mode profiles remained similar in the unbound and bound
forms aligned with the moving regions in collective dynamics (Figure 6C,D). Moreover,
binding of these may preserve or amplify mobility of the key regions surrounding E484 and
N501 residues. This may allow for simultaneous
experimentally detected faster

binding of ACE2 albeit prone to the

dynamic exchange and dissociation.36 According to the

experiments, attachment of preincubated RBD and EY6A to immobilized ACE2 indicated that
the off-rate from ACE2 was increased by the presence of EY6A, suggesting a crosstalk between
the binding of ACE2 and EY6A antibodies.36

could potentially act as

dramatically altering collective motions and allosteric protein response but rather fine-tune

allosteric couplings between ACE2-binding site and cryptic binding site, arguably facilitating a

Mutational Scanning Heatmaps Identify Binding Energy Hotspots and

Interaction

Propensities of Functional Sites in the SARS-CoV-2 Complexes with Antibodies
To provide further comparison between the computational and experimental data, we performed
mutational sensitivity analysis and constructed mutational heatmaps for SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD
binding (Figure 7). The binding epitope of the class I antibody B38 has a considerable overlap
with the ACE2 binding site (Figure 1). In fact, 21 residues of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD are
shared between epitope residues bound by B38 and ACE2.

The unique epitope residues that

interact with the B38 antibody include D405, E406, T415, G416, D420, Y421, N460, Y473,
A475, E484, and G496 (Figure 7A). However, only several of these positions (Y421, Y473,
A475 residues) corresponded to the binding hotspots (Figure 7A). The computed mutational
scanning map for the S-RBD binding with B38
N487, Q493,

and Y505

pointed to sites K417, Y421, Y453, F456,

as the most dominant binding energy hotspots, displaying large

destabilization loss in these positions for all substitutions (Figure 7A). These results are in good
agreement with deep mutational scanning analysis.19,42,45

A considerably smaller binding

footprint was found for class II antibody P2B-2F6 binding where major binding hotspots
corresponded to the residue cluster surrounding key anchoring position of Y449 (Figure 7B). All
mutations in this position produced large destabilization changes. A similar mutational scanning
signature was observed in positions G447, N450, L452, V483, E484, G485, and F490 (Figure
7B). Notably, the most prominent binding energy hotspots corresponded to G447, Y449,
E484, and F490 residues. The computed mutational maps reproduced the experimental data by
identifying important epitope residues in the cryptic binding site targeted by EY6A and S304
(Figure 7C).

Mutational scanning of EY6A binding with the S-RBD revealed a dense cluster of binding
energy hotspots corresponding to Y369, F377, K378, C379, Y380, G381, V382, S383, P384,
T385, K386 and F390 residues that form the core of the binding epitope (Figure 7C). Several
other hotspots were aligned with positions P412, G413, Q414. Class III antibodies EY6A and
S304 bind to the same cryptic site and share very similar binding epitopes with CR3022. In
silico mutational scanning is consistent with complete mapping of antibody-escaping RBD
mutations for this class where antibody recognition can be evaded by mutations of the RBD
core residues F374, G381, V382, S383, and F392.42,45
Despite a number of local interaction contacts formed by B38 with functional sites K417, E484
and N501 only K417 featured as an appreciable energetic hotspot. Comparison of predicted
ΔΔGs shows that a number of mutations at K417 site, particularly K417A/G/D/T resulted in a
large destabilization effect (Figure 8A).

In contrast, very minor changes are triggered by

modifications of E484 where some mutations such as E484F and E484W may yield moderate
stabilization largely due to the enhanced structural stability of this flexible region (Figure 8B).
Mutations of N501 residues are generally moderately detrimental to binding with B38 with the
exception of N501A and N501Y modifications that caused a more significant loss of binding
(Figure 8C). We found that circulating mutations K417N (Figure 8A) and N501Y (Figure 8C)
could compromise S-RBD binding to the B38 antibody, producing the destabilization effect that
can be compounded by simultaneous substitutions in these positions.

The results of in silico mutational screening that are based on knowledge-based mean force
potentials are consistent with more detailed and laborious quantum chemical-based fragment
molecular orbital (FMO) evaluation of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein binding with the B38 Fab
antibody.97,98 By analyzing FMO-based interaction energies98,

a range of residues critical for

molecular recognition with B38 Fab antibody was identified that also included R403, Q409,
K458, G476, N501, G502, V503, G504, and Y505 sites.
In some contrast, K417 and N501 positions are not involved in significant contacts with P2B2F6 and located on fringes of the binding epitope. The computed free energy values upon
mutations in these positions largely reflected changes in the protein stability that are very small
and generally destabilizing (Figure 8D,F). Despite somewhat less dramatic destabilization
changes, all mutations in E484 position showed a consistent and appreciable loss of binding
affinity, including the E484K circulating mutation (Figure 8E).

This implied that binding for

this class of antibodies could be highly sensitive to mutations in E484 position and trigger
resistance to the E484K variant. This is consistent with functional studies showing that
E484K/N501Y/K417N mutations in the 501Y.V2 lineage confer a strong neutralization escape
from classes I and II of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.27

The results also suggested that antibodies

from class I (B38) and II (P2B-2F6) can be vulnerable to distinct and non-overlapping
variants as confirmed in biochemical studies99 According to the latest experiments, the B.1.351
(501Y.V2) variant that emerged in South Africa is resistant to neutralization by multiple
monoclonal antibodies targeting the RBM of the S-RBD which is mostly due to a mutation
causing an E484K substitution.99 These functional studies indicated that E484K mutation could
trigger antibody escape for class I and II antibodies.

By combining

mutational scanning

analysis with the results of functional dynamics profiling, one could notice that mutations in

the E484 position may alter allosteric protein response for both classes of antibodies, even
though binding affinity losses appeared to be significant only for the class II antibodies. This
highlighted the relevance of both local and global factors induced by the mutational variants
on antibody binding, where the ultimate functional response may be often affected by a nontrivial combination of binding and allosteric effects.
Functional sites K417, E484 and N501 positions are located outside of the cryptic epitope and
not involved in any interactions with EY6A and S304 antibodies (Figure 7C). Mutational
sensitivity profiles in these positions in the complexes with EY6A (Figure 8G-I) reflected
minor changes associated with protein stability variations. Interestingly, some of these changes
corresponded to the improved stability of the S-RBD, particularly for mutations in E484 and
N501 sites. This indicated that functional sites E484 and N501 retain a considerable degree of
structural and energetic

plasticity

in complexes with EY6A and S304,

suggesting that

circulating mutations in these positions would not confer escape from class III of SARS-CoV-2
antibodies but may modulate simultaneous binding of ACE2 and allosteric interactions between
the binding sites.
To compare

the free energy changes

induced by mutations of the binding epitope we

specifically examined the alanine mutation scanning profiles residues in different complexes
(Supporting Information, Figure S3). By mapping positions of the binding epitopes onto these
distributions, we observed high destabilization changes for RBM sites involved in interactions
with B38 (Supporting Information, Figure S3A). Noticeably, binding free energy loss upon
alanine mutations of K417 and N501 sites were quite appreciable, confirming that K417 is one of
the central epitope residues for B38. A narrower spectrum of the binding epitope residues is
evident in the complex with class II P2B-2F6 antibody (Supporting Information, Figure S3B).

Alanine scanning of only several epitope residues (Y449, L452, E484) produced large
destabilization changes. The distribution also highlighted that the RBM residues near Y449 and
E484 contribute appreciably to binding affinity by forming two small hotspot clusters
(Supporting Information, Figure S3B).

Alanine modifications in K417 and N501 produced

only small changes with this class of antibodies.

Consistent with the experimental deep

mutagenesis, we observed a wide spectrum of large destabilization changes caused by alanine
substitutions of the binding epitope residues in the complex with class III EY6A antibody
(Supporting Information, Figure S3C). A particularly strong hotspot cluster is formed near
conserved rigid positions F377, C379, Y380 and V382. The large destabilization changes in
these sites are largely determined by the loss of protein stability upon alanine modifications of
these hydrophobic residues. It should be noted that alanine mutations of K417, E484 and N501
yielded only very minor changes as these sites retain a considerable degree of mobility in the
complexes with this class of antibodies (Supporting Information, Figure S3C). In general, these
distributions highlighted the diversity of the binding energy hotspots, particularly indicating
relatively moderate contribution of

variants that displayed a fair amount of structural and energetic plasticity.
antibody P2B-2F6
classes of antibodies

Only for class II

E484 emerged as an important binding energy hotspot, while for other
single mutations in these functional positions typically incurred only

relatively moderate destabilization changes. Nonetheless, a compounded effect of circulating
mutations K417N and N501Y could be more significant for binding with class I B38 antibody.
We argue that escape mutations constrained by the requirements for host cell binding and RBD
stability may select energetically adaptable sites that compromise antibody recognition through
modulation of global motions and allosteric protein responses.

Perturbation-Based Scanning of Spike Residues in the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD Complexes
with Antibodies : Allosteric Duality of Functional Centers Targeted by Global Variants
Using the PRS method we probed the allosteric effector and sensor potential of the S-RBD
residues in complexes with studied antibodies. In the perturbation-based scanning model, the
effector profiles evaluate allosteric propensity of protein residues to efficiently propagate signals
over long-range in response to systematically applied external perturbations. Accordingly, the
local maxima along the effector profile may serve as an indicator of allosteric hotspots that can
influence dynamic changes in other residues and may control signal transmission in the system.
The sensor profile and respective distribution peaks highlight residues that have a strong
propensity to sense signals and produce allosteric response through altered dynamics. We
compared the PRS effector profile for the unbound S-RBD form and antibody-bound forms
(Figure 9). In the complex with B38, several effector peaks corresponding to structurally stable
RBD regions (residues 348-352, 400-406) are preserved in the bound form (Figure 9A). Due to
B38-induced modulation of the effector profile, K417 and N501 positions become aligned with
the notable peaks, suggesting that these residues acquire a strong allosteric potential in the
complex and correspond to the stable effector hotspots (Figure 9A). On the other hand, the
effector potential value for the E484 site remained largely unchanged as compared to the
unbound form.

The PRS sensor profile for the RBD-B38 complex (Figure 10A) indicated

that none of the functional sites of circulating mutations are mapped onto distribution peaks. As a
result, allosteric communication in this complex may be highly dependent mostly on two
functional positions K417 and N501.

These observations complemented collective dynamics analysis showing that K417 and N501
residues become aligned with the hinge sites and allosteric effector centers that coordinate longrange communication between S-RBD and B38 molecules. While modifications of K417 and
N501 residues appeared to trigger moderate changes in the binding affinity, the perturbations
inflicted on these sites would have a significant effect on dynamics in other regions and
allosteric signaling in the complex. In other words, allosteric hotspots may be energetically
adaptable and not necessarily correspond to the structurally stable binding energy hotspots.
These results support the recent studies suggesting that functional plasticity is central to
allosteric regulation where allosteric hotspots may often correspond to structurally adaptable
and moderately conserved protein positions.100
In the S-RBD complex with the class II antibody P2B-2F6, the effector profile was similar to the
unbound form, but featured notable changes near E484 and N501 positions (Figure 9B).

The

allosteric effector propensities were markedly increased for E484 residue revealing a strong
peak of the distribution, while the effector potential for N501 residue was clearly reduced
(Figure 9B). Hence, antibody-induced stabilization of Y449 and E484 sites could lead to
modulation of its allosteric propensities. As a result, these sites are not only important binding
energy hotspots but also acquire significant allosteric potential in the complex. Although the
sensor profile for this complex is similar to the one obtained for RBD-B38 complex, we noticed
the increased sensor potential for K417 and N501 positions (Figure 10B). This suggested that
functional sites may be engaged in an allosteric cross-talk of effector and sensor centers, where
the binding signal induced by the P2B-2F6 antibody can be transmitted to other RBD regions.
In general, our findings suggested that class II antibody binding exemplified by P2B-2F6 may
exhibit strong

dependence on Y449 and E484 sites as mutations in these positions could

significantly compromise both binding affinity and antibody-induced allosteric signaling. This
may be an example where

antibody binding recruits structurally adaptable E484 site and

significantly alters the pattern of collective motions and communications in the spike protein.
These results are consistent with the experimental evidence according to which E484 and F486
play a central role in this epitope.32
A different pattern of the effector and sensor centers emerged from the analysis of the S-RBD
binding with EY6A and S304 antibodies. For both these III antibodies, the effector profiles
were very similar and generally followed the distribution shape of the unbound S-RBD form
(Figure 9C,D). We noticed a markedly increased effector peaks in the structurally stable regions
of the RBD core that are further rigidified by EY6A and S304 binding.

We capitalized on the

deep mutational screening of CR3022 antibody45 that features exactly the same footprint as
EY6A and S304. The sites of maximum escape for this class III antibodies correspond to C361,
V362, K378, V382, S383, F392, T430, I434, A435 residues that are aligned with the effector
peaks of the PRS distribution (Figure 9C,D). Accordingly, these sites could feature a significant
allosteric potential and correspond also to the allosteric control centers in the complexes.
Notably, none of the functional sites of circulating mutations were among effector centers.
Moreover, the effector potential for these residues was relatively low, owing in part to the
flexible nature of these regions that are solvent-exposed in complexes with EY6A and S304
(Figure 9C,D). The PRS sensor profiles for EY6A and S304 bound complexes showed strong
peaks for K417, E484, and N501 residues (Figure 10C,D). Of notice is the dominant peak in the
region centered on E484 and F486 residues. It implies that these positions correspond to the
dominant sensor centers that can effectively “absorb” signals sent from the RBD core and
execute protein response by altering collective dynamics in flexible regions.

In the PRS approach, the effector and sensor centers may act cooperatively to elicit long-range
protein response

to antibody binding and propagate allosteric signal through the protein.

Together with the conformational dynamics analysis, our results also showed that class III
antibodies may induce rigidification of the RBD core that is accompanied by the increased
flexibility of the RBM region, which is a manifestation of dynamics-driven allosteric changes.
This may explain the experimental results according to which

even though EY6A cannot

prevent ACE2 binding it can substantially increase the dissociation rate between ACE2 and
RBD.36 This may reflect the increased mobility of the RBM residues and localization of key
sensor hotspots in the regions interacting with the host receptor. Hence, functional sites K417,
E484 and N501 can be involved as either effector or sensor hotspots in the complexes with
different classes of antibodies. Hence, structurally and functionally adaptable allosteric centers
may be targeted by mutational variants because even small perturbations in these positions
would propagate over long-range allowing for modulation of antibody-induced protein response.
Our findings showed that

E484 site may be a critical effector hotspot for binding of class II

antibodies, while serving as a dominant sensor center in response to binding of class III
antibodies. Allosteric duality of this functional site could make it vulnerable to mutations
which may alter collective dynamics and potentially be a driver of antibody resistance to the
antibody classes I and II . Indeed, mutations in the epitope centered around E484 position (F486,
F490) were shown to strongly affect neutralization for different classes of antibodies.49,50
Collectively, our findings suggested that SARS-CoV-2 S protein may exploit plasticity of
specific allosteric hotspots to generate escape mutants that alter response to antibody binding
without compromising activity of the spike protein.

Conclusions
We combined MD simulations with mutational and perturbation-based scanning approaches to
perform a comprehensive structural profiling of binding and allosteric propensities of the SARSCoV-2 S-RBD residues in complexes with three different classes of antibodies. Our analysis
indicated that different classes of antibodies can uniquely change the spectrum of slow modes
and induce specific functional motions. The EY6A and S304 antibodies targeting the cryptic
binding site can modulate conformational dynamics without dramatically altering allosteric
protein response but rather fine-tune dynamic changes at the ACE2-binding site. Consistent with
deep mutational scanning experiments, in silico mutational profiling highlighted the diversity of
the binding energy hotspots induced by different classes of antibodies. Mutational analysis of
K417, E484 and N501 positions implicated in circulating variants showed that these residues
correspond to the

interacting centers with a significant degree of structural and energetic

plasticity. Only for class II antibody P2B-2F6

one of these sites E484 is a prominent binding

energy hotspot, while for other classes of antibodies

single mutations in these functional

positions typically incurred relatively moderate destabilization changes.

Using perturbation-

based scanning approach we probed allosteric propensity of spike residues and determined the
allosteric hotspots involved in regulation of signaling. The results showed that sites of circulating
mutations K417, E484 and N501 correspond to energetically adaptable allosteric hotspots that
regulate functional motions and allosteric protein response to different classes of antibodies.
This study provides a useful atomistic insight into allosteric regulatory mechanisms of SARSCoV-2 S proteins, suggesting that circulating mutational variants are likely to emerge in
structurally and evolutionary adaptable regulatory switch positions to elicit a differential protein
response to the host cell receptor while evading antibody binding.
