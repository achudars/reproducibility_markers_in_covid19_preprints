Abstract
Background: COVID-19 vaccines are approved, vaccination campaigns are launched,
and worldwide return to normality seems within close reach. Nevertheless, concerns
about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines arose, due to their fast emergency approval. In
fact, the problem of antibody-dependent enhancement was raised in the context of
COVID-19 vaccines.
Methods and findings: We introduce a complex extension of the model underlying
the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim 1.1 (http://covidsim.eu/) to optimize
vaccination strategies with regard to the onset of campaigns, vaccination coverage,
vaccination schedules, vaccination rates, and efficiency of vaccines. Vaccines are not
assumed to immunize perfectly. Some individuals fail to immunize, some reach only
partial immunity, and – importantly – some develop antibody-dependent enhancement,
which increases the likelihood of developing symptomatic and severe episodes
(associated with higher case fatality) upon infection. Only a fraction of the population
will be vaccinated, reflecting vaccination hesitancy or contraindications.
We parameterized the model to reflect the situation in Germany and predict
increasing incidence (and prevalence) in early 2021 followed by a decline by summer.
Assuming contact reductions (curfews, social distancing, etc.) to be lifted in summer,
disease incidence will peak again. Fast vaccine deployment contributes to reduce disease
incidence in the first quarter of 2021, and delay the epidemic outbreak after the summer
season. Higher vaccination coverage results in a delayed and reduced epidemic peak. A
coverage of 75% − 80% is necessary to prevent an epidemic peak without further drastic
contact reductions.
Conclusions: With the vaccine becoming available, compliance with contact
reductions is likely to fade. To prevent further economic damage from COVID-19, high
levels of immunization need to be reached before next year’s flu season, and vaccination
strategies and disease management need to be flexibly adjusted. The predictive model
can serve as a refined decision support tool for COVID-19 management.

Introduction

1

Interventions such as curfews, lockdowns, cancellations of mass events, in response to
the COVID-19 pandemic caused massive losses in revenue for whole economic
sectors [1], [2]. They were justified as legitimate measures to delay the epidemic to
increase healthcare capacities, develop effective treatments, and vaccines to immunize
the population. Despite all efforts, the spread of COVID-19 since fall 2020 drives
healthcare systems to their limits in Europe and North America, underlining the urge
for an effective and safe vaccine.
Governments across the globe were ambitious in facilitating SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
development, by large-scale programs such as Operation Warp Speed launched by the
US Government [3]. Currently, more than 227 vaccine-development projects against
SARS-CoV-2 are ongoing [4]. There are four major vaccination platforms to stimulate
antibody production triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein: (i) viral vectors fused
with a gene that encodes for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein; (ii) inactivated
SARS-CoV-2 variants; (iii) protein subunits of SARS-CoV-2 antigens; and (iv) a rather
new technique, where lipid nanoparticles encapsulate nucleoside-modified mRNA
(modRNA) encoding mutated forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The most
promising candidates typically follow a 2-3 week vaccination schedule, after whose
completion the protective effect is reached within 2-3 weeks [5], [6].
Russia was ambitious to release the world’s first SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
Gam-COVID-Vac. In homage named Sputnik V, the vaccine is based on two human
adenovirus (common cold) vectors [7], costs less than 20 USD per dose, and is highly
controversial due to its fast emergency use authorization (EUA) without a phase III
study [8]. Nevertheless, mass vaccination started in Russia on December 5, 2020. The
modified chimpanzee adenovirus vector-based candidate from AstraZeneca, AZD1222, is
currently under phase III study, will cost only 4 USD per dose, and has a capacity of
400 million doses for Europe and 300 million doses for the USA.
China gave EUA to two vaccines that trigger an immune response by inactivated
SARS-CoV-2 variants. BBIBP-CorV has a capacity of 1 billion doses for China in 2021
at a cost of less than 75 USD per dose and was fully approved, while CoronaVac costs
30 USD per dose. Covaxin (BBV152) is a cheap vaccine (1.36 USD per dose) currently
under EUA developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research, based on inactivated
SARS-CoV-2 variants.
NVX-CoV2373 by Novavax, seeking approval in Mexico, is a vaccine that uses
SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike protein nanoparticles with adjuvants to trigger an
immune response [9].
Two modRNA-based candidates are currently in phase III studies, which either seek
approval or were granted EUA. Tozinameran (BNT162b2) by BioNTech (20 USD per
dose), was approved in Canada and Europe, and received EUA in the UK and the USA.
A second modRNA-based candidate, mRNA-1273 by Moderna, is currently in phase III
trials, and received EUA in Canada and the USA.
Vaccination campaigns aim for herd immunity. There is an ongoing debate on the
optimal deployment of the vaccine. Some countries have ambitious deployment
strategies, e.g., Morocco plans to immunize up to 80% of the population. Globally the
trend is to deploy vaccines voluntarily and free of charge, with a general agreement to
prioritize vulnerable risk groups (e.g., senior citizens, people with co-morbidities, etc.)
and people of systemic importance (e.g., healthcare workers, police, public services)
before making the vaccine available to the general public [10]. Incentives for getting
voluntary vaccines have been proposed, e.g., recently Qantas airlines announced to make
the vaccine mandatory for their passengers [11, 12].
Nevertheless, skepticism about vaccines and their potential side effects are
widespread, resulting in vaccine hesitancy [13]. One of the potentially negative effects of

a vaccine is the occurrence of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) or, more general,
enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) [14, 15]. ADE is best understood in Dengue fever
and was observed also in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV both in vitro and in vivo [16]. In
SARS-CoV-2, ADE occurs most likely via enhanced immune activation [17]. Here,
sub-optimal antibodies form immune complexes with the virus that deposit into airway
tissues and activate cytokine and complement pathways. This triggers inflammation,
airway obstruction, and even acute respiratory distress syndrome [17]. By this
mechanism, vaccines could potentially result in more severe symptoms upon infection
with SARS-CoV-2.
Here, we employ predictive modelling to explore the outcome of vaccination
strategies on the COVID-19 pandemic. We explore the influence of (i) the vaccination
coverage reflecting vaccine hesitancy, the commonness of contraindications, and access
to the vaccine; (ii) the vaccination rate, reflecting supply and infrastructure; and (iii)
the immunizing effect on disease incidence, prevalence, and mortality. We further
investigate the impact of the launch of the vaccination campaign relative to the
epidemic peak. Intentionally, our model accounts for the occurrence of ADE, ERD, and
other deleterious side effects of the vaccine – subsumed here as ADE. By this approach,
we seek to address the following questions: What is the benefit of launching the
vaccination campaign early (at full scale) to substantially reduce disease incidence? Can
side effects of the vaccine result in overall higher mortality than the virus itself? How
fast should the vaccine be deployed? Which vaccination coverage should be aimed at?
We use an extension of the SEIR model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool
CovidSim 1.1 [18] to predict the outcome of vaccination campaigns. The model
incorporates general contact reduction (hard and soft lockdowns, social distancing, etc.)
and case isolation in a time-dependent manner. Unvaccinable persons, summarizing
anti-vaxxers, individuals with contraindications, and individuals that do not have access
to the vaccine, are properly addressed. Furthermore, immunization after receiving the
vaccine does not occur instantaneously, reflecting vaccination schedules and
immunogenicity. Importantly, our model allows individuals to be vaccinated during the
infection (if it is asymptomatic and undetected) and to be infected before the outcome
of the vaccination manifests. As an example, we use model parameters that reflect the
situation in the Federal Republic of Germany. In the main text, we present only a
verbal description of the model and refer to S1 Appendix for a concise formal
description, dedicated to readers interested in the technical aspects of the model.

We model the occurrence of ADE during vaccination campaigns in the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic by an extended SEIR model. More precisely, we generalize the
compartmental model underlying the pandemic preparedness tool CovidSim (cf. [18]),
which is formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations. Modelling ADE
requires a substantial extension of the original model. We describe it verbally in a
simplified form here and refer readers interested in a concise description to S1 Appendix.

We divide a population of size N into susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals,
each of which is subdivided into numerous compartments. During the course of the
infection (Fig 1), individuals pass through the (i) latent phase (no symptoms, not yet
infectious); (ii) prodromal phase (no symptoms, infectious but not yet to the fullest
extent); (iii) fully infectious phase (symptoms might start, infectious to the fullest
extent); (iv) late infectious phase (infectiousness is reduced). The fully infectious and

late infectious phases can be asymptomatic or symptomatic with mild or severe
symptoms. At the beginning of the fully infectious phase a fraction of infections
becomes symptomatic (mild or severe symptoms), whereas the remaining fraction
remains asymptomatic. At the end of the late infectious phase individuals either recover
and obtain full immunity or they die. Only symptomatic infections can result in death,
asymptomatic infections are not lethal (except individuals get vaccinated during the
infection and this results in complications).

invective and potentially symptomatic.

Susceptible individuals

108

Susceptible individuals are sub-divided (see Fig 2) into those that are: (i) not vaccinable
because they do not have access, refuse to be vaccinated, or cannot be vaccinated for
medical reasons (e.g., allergies, or the vaccine is not approved for them); (ii) waiting to
be vaccinated; (iii) already vaccinated, but the outcome of the vaccination is still
pending; (iv) already vaccinated, but only partially immunized; (v) vaccinated, but the
vaccination completely failed to immunize; (vi) vaccinated, but the vaccine caused ADE.
Vaccinable susceptibles have to wait before being vaccinated. The outcome of the
vaccination does not occur immediately but after some waiting time (pending outcome).
Vaccination either results in (i) full immunity, (ii) partial immunity, (iii) no immunity
(the vaccine had no effect), or (iv) ADE (the vaccine had a deleterious effect). Partial
immunity gives some protection from infection and manifests in a lower likelihood to
develop symptoms upon infection. ADE also protects partially from infections, but
upon infection increases the likelihood of severe disease (and death).

Fig 2. Groups of susceptible and immunized individuals. Schematic representation of different compartments of
susceptible individuals. Unvaccinated susceptibles are either unvaccinable (NV) or wait to be vaccinated (U). Vaccinated
susceptibles (V) remain susceptible immediately after vaccination. After the vaccination outcome manifested, they remain
susceptible at different levels if immunization failed (NI), only partial immunization was achieved (PI), or they developed
ADE. Individuals that are successfully immunized are no longer susceptible (R). Arrows show how individuals move between
groups. All susceptibles can be infected (not indicated).

Effect of vaccination

122

Individuals are vaccinated only once (one vaccination cycle, subsuming all necessary
doses). The waiting time during which immunization is pending reflects the waiting
time for the vaccination cycle to be completed (it can be one or several doses). In the
model we need to distinguish between infections of individuals that are (i) partially
immunized, (ii) not immunized or unvaccinable, (iii) developed ADE, and (iv)
vaccinable, but still waiting to be vaccinated. Vaccinable individuals (those that wait
for vaccination) can also be vaccinated when they are already infected (i.e., during the
latent, and prodromal phases, and during the fully infectious and late infectious phases
if the infections remain asymptomatic and undetected; see Figure 3). After some
waiting period (during which the effect of the vaccination is pending) these individuals
are either successfully, partially, or not immunized, or they might be affected by ADE.
The likelihood of these outcomes depends on the phase of the infection. Particular
consideration is given to individuals that are vaccinated during the fully infectious or
late infectious phase. Namely, when the disease has already progressed, the effect of the
vaccine potentially changes.

Fig 3. Simplified model flow. Susceptible individuals are infected and ultimately recover or die. Individuals are infected
either after or before the outcome of the vaccination is determined. In the latter case the outcome of the vaccine is not
determined upon infection (they might get vaccinated before or during the infection), or they are not vaccinated before or
during the infection (this includes unvaccinable individuals that get infected).

Case isolation

138

A fraction of symptomatic infections seeks medical help and will be isolated in
quarantine wards, until the wards are full, in which case they are sent in home isolation.
Quarantine wards guarantee perfect isolation, whereas home isolation does not eliminate
all infectious contacts with the isolated individuals.

General contact reduction

140
141
142

143

During designated time intervals general contact reduction (curfews, social distancing,
cancellation of mass events, etc.) is sustained. These phases reduce the number of
contacts between individuals in the population. These contact reductions are time
dependent. For the simulations here we assume an initial “hard lockdown” followed by a
phase of relief, a “soft lockdown”, a second “hard lockdown”, and a final relief phase
before contact reductions are lifted.

Susceptible individuals get infected by random contacts with infected individuals that
can transmit the disease and are not isolated. The contact rates are mediated by general
contact reduction. The basic reproductive number R0 is assumed to fluctuate seasonally.

Results

158

Here, we study the effectiveness of different hypothetical vaccination
programs/strategies to immunize the population in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in
terms of disease incidence (or prevalence) and overall mortality. Vaccination campaigns
differ in (i) their onset and vaccination rate reflecting the available infrastructure
(availability of the vaccine and medical infrastructure); (ii) the vaccination coverage,
reflecting the willingness of the population to get vaccinated and access to medical care;
and (iii) vaccination schedules, immunogenicity, and efficacy/effectiveness summarizing
vaccine-specific properties. The ultimate goal of any vaccination campaign is to reach
herd immunity, mitigate SARS-CoV-2, and “return to normality” as soon as possible.
We explore how fast herd immunity is reached assuming that contact reductions cannot
be sustained for too long. The approach is conservative, as we focus on the potential
negative effects of the vaccine.
We report disease incidence and prevalence. Disease prevalence is defined as the sum
of all infected individuals (in the latent, prodromal, fully infectious, and late infectious
phases). Incidence, i.e., the number of new cases per time interval, is notoriously
difficult to define in an SEIR-type model since individual infections are not modelled
explicitly. We approximated incidence as prevalence divided by the duration of an

average disease episode during which the infection is detectable. More concretely, we
defined incidence as prevalence divided by 10 days. Hence, incidence and prevalence
differ only by a multiplicative factor here an can be used synonymously. Both are
reported for the readers convenience to facilitate comparison with publicly accessible
data.
Regarding the results, we use model parameters reflecting the situation in the
Federal Republic of Germany that so far intervened successfully in the COVID-19
pandemic. The parameters used are listed in S1 Table - S5 Table. The population size
of Germany was set to N = 83 million. We assumed the first COVID-19 cases were
introduced in late February 2020 (corresponding to t = 0). A basic yearly average
reproductive number of R̄0 = 3.5 was assumed, which fluctuates seasonally by 43% with
a peak in late December (tR0max = 300). The average durations for the latent,
prodromal, fully infectious and late infectious phases were set to DE = 3.7, DP = 1,
DI = 5, DL = 5 days, respectively. Individuals in the prodromal and late infectious
phases were half as infectious as in the fully infectious phase (cP = cL = 0.5). If
individuals developed only partial immunity or ADE, they were assumed to be half as
susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 than unimmunized individuals (pPI = pADE = 0.5). A
percentage fSick = 58% of infections became symptomatic if immunity was not mediated
by the vaccine. This percentage decreased for partially immunized individuals and
increased for those that developed ADE (see S4 Table). Regarding general contact
reduction, we assumed a “hard lockdown” from late March (tDist1 = 21) to early May
2020 (tDist2 = 75) that reduced pDist1 = 70% of all contacts, followed by a period of
relaxation until the end of October (tDist3 = 246) during which pDist2 = 48% of the
contacts were avoided. The first “soft lockdown” from late October was sustained until
the end of December (tDist4 = 300) with a contact reduction of pDist3 = 60%. This was
followed by a second “hard lockdown” from late December until late January
(tDist5 = 330) and a phase of relief resulting in a pDist4 = 60% contact reduction
sustained until June 2021 (tDist6 = 450), after which all general contact reductions are
lifted reflecting the worst-case scenario, in which compliance with social distancing can
no longer be sustained in the face of the vaccine becoming available.
The simulation results until late December (t = 300) match the disease incidence in
Germany. Notably, only the number of confirmed, not of actual cases is known. The
true incidence (which is modelled) is obviously unobservable and might be substantially
higher than the confirmed incidence (true incidence multiplied with the probability of
detection). Consequently, the incidences in Figs 4-9 exceed the number of reported cases
in Germany - however, the numbers are plausible and match in the order of magnitude.
Regarding the vaccination campaigns, we use the following reference scenario: 60% of
the population will get vaccinated, a vaccination rate of 1/180 (i.e., an average time of
180 days to get vaccinated), a launch of the campaign in early January 2021 (t = 300),
and a vaccination schedule of 28 days (the vaccine becomes effective after 28 days).

We consider the situation in which no vaccination campaign (VC) is launched as a
reference case for comparisons. Figs 4A-D show disease incidence, which matches the
reported numbers in Germany. The base reproductive number is at the seasonal
maximum at times t = 300 and t = 665. Although R0 declines after t = 300, the end of
the second “hard lockdown” in late January (t = 330) leads to an increase in incidence.
In fact, it will more than double by the end of March 2021 (t = 390), after which it will
decline due to seasonal reductions in R0 . After contact reductions are lifted at time
t = 450, disease incidence would increase drastically and the epidemic peak would be
reached around t = 590 (late October 2021) with almost 40% of the population being
infected at this time point. This is a hypothetical worst-case scenario.

Onset of vaccination campaigns

227

The onset of the vaccination campaign (VC) has a profound effect on disease incidence
(see Fig 4). The earlier the onset of the VC, the earlier and the stronger the reduction in
incidence after the second “hard lockdown”. Even if the VC starts at t = 300 incidence
will increase after the second “hard lockdown”. However, the increase is less than half of
that observed without a VC. Launching the campaign in March 2021 (t = 360) hardly
leads to a reduction in disease incidence until summer 2021 (Figs 4A, C). (The launch
of the VC has to be interpreted as the time when it becomes fully effective.)
A much stronger effect of the VC’s onset manifests after contact reduction is no
longer sustained. High epidemic peaks will emerge at the end of 2021 or in early 2022.
Later launches of the VC result in earlier and higher epidemic peaks (Figs 4B, D). The
differences in height of the epidemic peaks are substantial in comparison to disease
incidence in 2020. In any case, the benefit of the VCs is clear. The epidemic peaks will
be substantially lower compared to the situation without a VC. The earlier the
vaccination campaign starts, the higher the reduction in mortality. Indeed the
differences by the end of June 2021 (t = 450) are visible (Fig 4E). The reduction in
mortality by the end of March 2022 is substantial (Fig 4F).

Also, the proportion of the population being vaccinated has a profound effect on disease
incidence and mortality. Even if only 25% of the population gets vaccinated, there is a
substantial decrease in incidence by time t = 450 (June 2021). The higher the
proportion of individuals being vaccinated, the stronger the reduction in incidence (Figs
5A, C). Incidence will not substantially decrease further if the proportion of the
population being vaccinated exceeds 80%. This directly translates into mortality (Figs
5E, F).
It takes a vaccination coverage of about 70% to avoid a high epidemic peak after the
contact reductions are lifted. The lower the proportion of the population being
vaccinated, the earlier and higher will the epidemic peak be (Fig 5B). If 75% of the
population gets vaccinated, an epidemic peak emerges in spring 2022 (t = 750) - notice
this prediction assumes that no contact reducing interventions are in place after summer
2021 (t = 450). This peak will exceed the one in early 2021. If 80% of the population is
vaccinated, a pandemic peak that is in between the first and second wave of 2020
emerges. This peak will be avoided if 85% of the population gets vaccinated.
Mortality substantially decreases as the proportion of the population getting
vaccinated increases (Figs 5C, D). The reduction occurs in a nonlinear fashion and
shrinks with higher proportions of the population being vaccinated.
Note that vaccination coverage is not the same as the herd immunity threshold. The
latter is the percentage of the population that needs to be immune for the disease to
vanish. The vaccination coverage is the the percentage of the population that will be
vaccinated throughout the epidemic. A higher coverage reflects faster deployment of the

Rate of vaccination

268

Not surprisingly, the faster the population is vaccinated the better. Assuming a realistic
average waiting time to be vaccinated ranging between 180 - 300 days and 60%
vaccination coverage, the effects are immediately visible in the short term (from t = 300
to t = 450, see Figs 6A, C). The benefit of vaccinating the population fast becomes
substantial in the long term. In fact, the epidemic peak that emerges at around
generation t = 700 (early 2022) is twice as high if the waiting time to get vaccinated is
300 days rather than 180 days on average (see Figs 6B, D). This translates directly into
mortality (see Figs 6E, F).

to get vaccinated.

Vaccination schedule and immunogenicity

277

Another important factor in VCs is the time until immunization is reached, as
determined by the vaccination schedule and immunogenicity. There is a visible effect if
the time to immunization is increased from 28 days to 42 days. However, the effect is
not as strong as that of the rate of infection or the proportion being vaccinated. In
relative terms, the short-term effect is more pronounced (cf. Figs 7A with B and C with
D). The reason is that the number of infections is rising at the onset of the vaccination
campaign. During this period early immunization reduces the spread of COVID-19.
Once incidence is low, the time to immunization is not as important until the final
epidemic peak emerges. This will emerge earlier and will be higher if the time to
immunization is longer (see Figs 7B, D). Again, incidence directly translates into
mortality (see Figs 7E, F). The long-term effect on mortality of longer times to
immunization is by far less pronounced than those of the vaccination rate and
proportion of vaccinated individuals.

Effectiveness of the vaccine

291

The better the immunizing effect of the vaccine, the more effective is the VC. We
compared four scenarios summarized in Table 1, one being a worst-case scenario which
is unrealistic and just used as a comparison. When effectiveness increases from 78%
(low) to 95% (high) full immunization there will be a clear drop in disease incidence and
mortality in the long run (see Figs 8B, D, F). The short-term effects are not as
pronounced (see Figs 8A, C, E). The hypothetical worst-case scenario, in which the
effectiveness is only 50%, leads to substantially higher infections and deaths.

Severity of ADE

299

By default, we assumed that ADE manifests in a higher probability of developing
(ADE)
symptomatic infections, i.e., fSick = 92% vs. fSick = 58%. Additionally, we
investigated the effect of higher mortality of symptomatic infections in individuals that
developed ADE. Figs 4-8 contrast the situations with and without ADE-induced
(ADE)
(ADE)
increased mortality (fDead = 20% vs. fDead = fDead = 7%). This increased mortality
does not change incidence. For a vaccine with high effectiveness, the impact of
ADE-induced increased mortality is marginal. If effectiveness is low, the effect is visible.
This is not surprising, because the occurrence of ADE and vaccine effectiveness are not
independent, namely, ADE occurs only if the vaccine fails to immunize properly. Fig 9
shows the effect of different amounts of mortality induced by ADE for different
vaccination coverage. The effects are not immediate and only visible in the long run.
The lower the vaccination coverage, the higher the increase in mortality. This is not
surprising: if a higher proportion of the population is immunized, it is less likely that
individuals that developed ADE get infected. Thus, the deleterious effects of ADE
cannot manifest.

With COVID-19 vaccines being approved swift and efficient action is required to
immunize populations around the globe to further contain health and economic
damages caused by the pandemic. Vaccination strategies need likely to be adjusted
flexibly in response to the current status of the pandemic, feasibility of logistics, further
vaccines becoming available, potential contraindications, side and long-term effects that
were not recognized during ongoing phase III clinical studies, and the willingness in the
population to get vaccinated. The purpose of this study was to tailor predictive
modelling to optimize vaccination strategies for COVID-19 management and
eradication. More precisely, we developed a realistic pandemic-preparedness model to
study the influence of the onset of vaccination campaigns, the vaccination rate (i.e., the
average time to get vaccinated), the vaccination coverage (the fraction of the population

that can get vaccinated), vaccination schedules, effectiveness of the vaccine, and adverse
side effects, particularly ADE. The model is a complex extension of the model
underlying CovidSim 1.1 http://covidsim.eu/ [18]. We parameterized the model to
reflect the situation in the Federal Republic of Germany, where vaccination campaigns
started in late December 2020. Notably, although the results reported reflect the
situation in Germany, the results apply qualitatively to any other country. Although,
the model itself can be adapted to other countries to obtain quantitative results, their
appropriateness needs to be taken with caution. Namely, the model neglects an explicit
age-structure. Therefore, it is applicable to industrial nations with demographics similar
to Germany. Adaptations will be necessary for low and middle-income countries with a
large young population. These adaptations can be done similarly as in CovidSim 2.0
http://covidsim.eu/.
The impact of the vaccination in terms of incidence and mortality depends on the
contact-reducing interventions in place. Here, it was assumed that a “hard lockdown”
will be sustained until the end of January 2020 followed by a “relief period” still with
relatively strong contact reduction, until summer 2021. Afterwards no contact reduction
was assumed. These assumptions are obviously questionable. The rationale behind
them was that case numbers in 2021 will first require action to reduce disease incidence
by sustaining contact reduction. Once people get vaccinated and incidence is decreasing,
compliance with distancing measures will fade after the summer season. As soon as
attendance of cultural events (e.g., concerts, museums, sports events, etc.) and
unrestricted air travel will be possible and mandatory wearing of facial masks will be
lifted for vaccinated individuals, it will be difficult to control distancing interventions in
the population. Notably, we assume that case isolation (quarantine and home isolation
of confirmed cases) is further sustained.
Our simulations adequately reflect the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in
Germany in 2020. The future predictions, however, depend on assumptions regarding
COVID-19 management. The model parameters need to be dynamically updated as
COVID-19 management interventions are altered. Particularly, parameters concerning
vaccination campaigns are likely to vary over time and can be modelled in a
time-dependent fashion. This is a straightforward generalization. Here, we decided to
simulate a plausible range of fixed parameters to quantify their effects, rather than
making assumptions on time-dependence that would be purely speculative. According
to our predictions, vaccination campaigns will have a strong impact on the reduction in
disease incidence. In the short term, a swift onset of the vaccination campaign
contributes to a substantial reduction in incidence and mortality in the first quarter of
2021. The later mass vaccination starts, the smaller the reduction in incidence or
mortality. The onset of the campaign mainly depends on the logistics to initially
distribute the vaccine efficiently.
The vaccination schedule also has a substantial impact on incidence and mortality.
Our simulations showed a substantial improvement if the time to immunization is
shortened from 42 to 28 days. This depends on the vaccination schedule, which requires
typically two doses with a waiting time of two to three weeks between them. After that,
the immunizing effect is reached within about 14 days. Efficient logistic planning and
properly scheduling appointments to receive the two required doses can help to
minimize the time to immunization.
Not surprisingly, the higher the vaccination rate (i.e., the faster the population is
vaccinated), the stronger the benefit. The vaccination rate depends crucially on the
available infrastructure. The modRNA-based vaccine of BioNTech (cf. Introduction)
requires storage between −60 to −80◦ C [20]. Therefore, it needs to be distributed
through a specific infrastructure (vaccination centers/units) limiting the vaccination
rate. The achievable vaccination rate hence depends on the approval and availability of

competing vaccines. Vaccine efficiency differs across competing products and has a
strong effect on incidence and mortality. In the simulations, by default, we assumed an
ambitious vaccination rate, with an average waiting time of 180 days to get vaccinated.
With two doses per person vaccinating 60% of the German population within one year
requires a capacity of 270 000 injections per day. With around 400 vaccination centers
that have been established, this requires a daily average capacity of 680 injections per
center. While the capacity is realistic, also the willingness to get vaccinated must be
high to efficiently utilize the capacities.
Another important factor is vaccination coverage. Our simulations suggest that a
vaccination coverage of 75% − 80% is necessary to mitigate the epidemic by summer
2021, without further strong lockdowns and contact restrictions. The reason is that a
sufficiently high level of immunity needs to be reached by the onset of the 2021 flu
season in order to prevent another epidemic outbreak. Such an outbreak might be more
difficult to control as interventions will be a balancing act between restrictions tolerable
by the vaccinated part and necessary to protect the unvaccinated part of the population.
Notably, even if the herd immunity threshold to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak is
substantially lower than 75%, this threshold must be reached on time. Importantly, the
vaccination coverage in our predictions also reflects the propensity to get vaccinated
early. Furthermore, vaccination does not lead to immunization in all cases, a fact that
was addressed in our model. In particular, we studied the consequences of varying
vaccine efficiencies, which have a substantial effect. According to clinical trials, efficacy
varies between 78% − 95% among the most promising vaccines [21–24]. With lower
efficiency vaccination coverage must increase to reach herd immunity, i.e, to reach
immunization in 60% if the population 63% needs to be vaccinated if efficiency is 95%,
while 77% need to be vaccinated if efficiency is just 78%.
Our predictions are conservative in as far as negative side effects of the vaccine were
considered. In particular, we incorporated ADE or more generally ERD. These are well
known in corona viruses and it has been explicitly warned about ADE in the context of
vaccination campaigns [17]. The effects of ADE are notoriously difficult to predict [25].
Here, we assumed that a fraction of vaccinated individuals develops ADE, which results
in a higher likelihood to develop symptomatic infections and higher mortality. Although
we assumed mortality to be substantially increased (20% rather than 7% mortality in
symptomatic infections), the overall effect was minor. More precisely, the reduction in
mortality due to immunization achieved through vaccination always outweighs increased
mortality due to ADE. This is an encouraging result that justifies neglecting ADE in
future models. In fact, our model can be substantially simplified if ADE is neglected.
While our predictions adequately reflect disease incidence, the predictions for
mortality have to be interpreted with caution. Namely, vaccination campaigns will
target risk groups suffering from elevated mortality first. In fact, 50% of
COVID-19-related deaths occur in long-term care facilities (LTCFs), although less than
1% of the German populations live inside such a facility. The spread of COVID-19 inside
LTCFs can be efficiently maintained by regularly testing employees [26]. Concerning the
interpretations of our results, mortality has to be understood qualitatively rather than
quantitatively. However, adequate quantitative predictions can be easily deduced from
our simulations by multiplying mortality with an adjustment factor. The relative effect
of model parameters remains unaffected by an increase or decrease in mortality.
In conclusion, vaccination campaigns should be launched as early as possible.
Logistics should be well planned to utilize the maximum capacity of the vaccination
infrastructure. Failure to immunize a sufficient part of the population by the beginning
of the flu season in 2021 will result in a high endemic peak, by far exceeding current
levels of incidence. Adverse effects of the vaccine such as ADE are by far outweighed by
the benefits of the vaccine. In fact, the higher vaccination coverage, the lower the risks

associated with ADE. We predict that vaccination coverage of 80% would result in
sufficiently high levels of herd immunity to allow a return to normality by summer 2021.
Nevertheless, it is important to sustain the vaccination campaign until the herd
immunity threshold is actually reached. This will require sustained incentives to get
vaccinated after disease incidence drops, e.g., through general contact reduction
measures being tight to vaccination coverage.
