Abstract
COVID-19 patients display a wide range of disease severity, ranging from asymptomatic to critical
symptoms with high mortality risk. Our ability to understand the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 infected
cells within the lung, and of protective or dysfunctional immune responses to the virus, is critical to
effectively treat these patients. Currently, our understanding of cell-cell interactions across different
disease states, and how such interactions may drive pathogenic outcomes, is incomplete. Here, we
developed a generalizable workflow for identifying cells that are differentially interacting across
COVID-19 patients with distinct disease outcomes and use it to examine five public single-cell RNAseq datasets with a total of 85 individual samples. By characterizing the cell-cell interaction patterns
across epithelial and immune cells in lung tissues for patients with varying disease severity, we
illustrate diverse communication patterns across individuals, and discover heterogeneous
communication patterns among moderate and severe patients. We further illustrate patterns derived
from cell-cell interactions are potential signatures for discriminating between moderate and severe
patients.

Introduction
Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 and is driving the ongoing pandemic impacting the
global population. The respiratory system is the primary route of infection for SARS-CoV-2, due to a
combination of airborne transmission (1) and the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 in
human airways (2–4). SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a spectrum of symptoms. Patients can be
asymptomatic, exhibit mild symptoms, or develop severe disease with increased risk of death (5, 6).
Disease outcome is dictated by a combination of direct viral effects on patient tissues (7), protective
antiviral immunity (8) and overexuberant antiviral or inflammatory immune responses driving tissue

damage (9, 10). However, it is not clear why some patients experience mild symptoms while others
succumb to the illness, and how communication between host compartments controls the disease
progression.

On inoculation, SARS-CoV-2 can infect cells in the oral/nasal mucosa (11) and nasopharynx
expressing low levels of ACE2 (12), with the virus descending to the lower airways in some patients to
infect ACE2+ type II alveolar epithelial cells (13). In more severe disease, SARS-CoV-2 infected cells
likely enhance or alter their communication networks to recruit additional immune support, in part
through excessive local innate immune engagement (14) which can then recruit neutrophil and T cells
from the blood which further escalate the inflammatory cascades leading to a “cytokine storm” in
patients with severe disease (15), (16). This vicious cycle eventually drives pathological inflammatory
cell and fluid accumulation and extensive tissue damage, leading to lung stiffness, impaired O2/CO2
exchange (together called acute respiratory distress syndrome; ARDS), and death. Paradoxically, many
patients do exhibit lower airway infection/inflammation yet experience only mild disease, and it is
unclear why these patients avoid critical disease.

To define the cellular transcriptional responses involved in COVID-19 severity, single-cell RNA-seq
has been performed on patient samples, including peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs),
bronchoalveolar lavage. These studies further reinforce the notion that excessive inflammation
correlates with negative disease outcome (17, 18). Beyond cell identification (19), single-cell analysis
can also be used to infer cell-cell interactions (20–22) and these approaches can help inform disease
mechanisms.

In this study, we harness collections of single-cell COVID-19 data sets available to evaluate the
molecular patterns associated with disease severity. Recognizing the importance of cell-cell

communication networks within the infected lung, we develop a generalizable workflow to explore
cell-cell interactions. We then apply our novel workflow to analyze the cell-cell communication
networks from patients with varying disease severity and pinpoint critical cell types and cell-cell
communication channels that mark healthy network communication as well as discriminate disease
severity.

Results
Generalizable workflow to identify and measure cell-cell communication in individuals
We develop a generalizable workflow based on statistical learning strategies that allow us to visualize,
identify and characterize cell-cell interaction patterns (Fig. 1A). The workflow begins with joint
classification using scClassify (19) based on four reference datasets (see Material and Methods) to
refine cell type annotations. Next, to partition cell heterogeneity, unsupervised clustering is performed
on each annotated cell type to further define subgroups of cells with the potential to identify cellular
subtypes associated with different disease progression. Cluster merging (23) is used here to prevent
overclustering. Finally, we calculate a cell-cell interaction score/measure for each individual COVID19 sample between different cellular subtypes. Applying this workflow to single-cell data with
multiple individuals will generate a large matrix for each individual sample with columns representing
cell types and rows representing ligand-receptor pairs (Fig. 1A). Each ligand-receptor pair is further
grouped into different pathways to facilitate interpretation. Details of this workflow are described in
the Materials and Methods section.

We examined five publicly available single-cell RNA-seq datasets from COVID-19 patients with
different degrees of severity, using samples from nasopharyngeal (NS), bronchoalveolar lavage fluid
(BALF), and PBMCs, including a total of 415,856 cells from 24 healthy controls, 30 moderate and 31
severe samples (Fig. 1B). In NS and BALF tissues (24, 25), we re-annotated the cells using four

healthy human lung scRNA-seq datasets (4, 26, 27) including 189,967 cells and 44 cell types. For the
Chua dataset with 5 healthy controls, 14 moderate and 13 severe samples (Supplementary Fig. 1A-B),
scClassify is able to identify additional cell types and provide further refinement as illustrated in Fig.
1C. For example, the original “outliers epithelial” cluster was refined to “ciliated cells”, and
“secretory” cells to “goblet” cells. By accounting for such refinement, the new annotation recapitulates
78% of the original published analysis. The classified cell types are clearly identified by known
markers (Supplementary Fig. 1C), and further clustering of the Chua dataset generates 50 subclusters.
Similar reannotation is applied to the Liao dataset (Supplementary Fig. 2A-B) resulting in 15 cell types
and 52 subclusters.

Cell-cell interactions are significantly different in patients with COVID-19 compared to healthy
individuals
To identify cell-cell interaction (CCI) differences with respect to disease severity in each dataset, we
calculate the CCI scores that represent the communication probabilities among all pairs of subclusters
across all ligand-receptor pairs (see Materials and Methods for details). Our group-specific CCI scores
(CCIgroup ) aggregate the scores across all different pathways between each major cell type pair for
different disease severity groups, represented as a network graph with thicker edges indicating stronger
cell-cell interaction. Our results highlight that in healthy controls, most cell-cell interactions are
between basal, ciliated, and goblet cells of the lung epithelium, with dendritic cells providing immune
surveillance (Fig. 2A). As disease severity increases, cell-cell interactions become dominated by
interactions between the lung epithelium and proinflammatory players within the immune
compartment (Fig. 2A-C, Supplementary Fig. 3A-E). Overall, we observe significantly less
communication (fewer edges in Fig. 2A) in healthy individuals compared to moderate (Fig. 2B) and
severe patients (Fig. 2C).

We next study the cell-cell interaction in all three datasets (18, 28, 29). Applying our developed
workflow, we unified the annotation across all three datasets (Supplementary Fig. 4A). We used the
Wilk dataset (with 44,721 cells and 20 cell types) as a reference (28) to reannotate the cell types for the
Zhang dataset and the Arunachalam dataset. Cells with the same annotation were well integrated with
scMerge (30) (Supplementary Fig. 4A), indicating that similar cell types exist in the three studies. We
observe distinct cell type compositions of these three studies, potentially due to different sampling or
cell isolation procedures (Supplementary Fig. 4B). In all three PBMC studies, we observe that in
monocyte-related interactions, COVID-19 patients generally have more cell-cell interactions than
healthy controls (Supplementary Fig. 5A-C). The results across all five datasets suggest that cell type
composition alone from single-cell experiments may not sufficiently discriminate between patients
with different disease severity. This, along with the varying cell-cell interaction patterns across disease
groups supports the further examination of the association between cell-cell interaction with disease
outcomes and progression.

Reduced T cell interactions and increased monocyte interactions in severe COVID-19 patients
across different compartments
Focusing on immune cell interactions in the upper airway, we observe different cell type interaction
patterns across patients with different disease severity (Fig. 2D, Supplementary Fig. 3F) in the Chua
dataset. Compared to moderate patients, severe patients have less T cell to T cell interaction (illustrated
by the thick blue edge on the T cell node in Fig. 2D) and more macrophage to macrophage interaction
(marked by thick red edge on the macrophage node in Fig. 2D). Between different cell types, we see
higher interactions between monocyte/macrophage or T cells towards neutrophils in severe patients,
consistent with previous findings (31). Similar patterns are observed in the Liao dataset where T cell to

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.30.424641; this version posted December 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

T cell interaction was higher in moderate patients, while interactions involving neutrophils and
monocytes increased in severe patients (Supplementary Fig. 2C).

The enrichment of monocyte dominated interactions in severe patients is also observed in all three
PBMC datasets (Supplementary Fig. 5D-F). Interestingly, two of the PBMC datasets (Zhang and
Arunachalam) illustrate that severe patients have a decrease in CD8 memory T cell interactions. The
lack of T cell interactions in severe patients suggests potential T cell depletion, a finding supported by
previous studies that lymphopenia is associated with severe disease (32–34). Together, these data
provide validation that our workflow can confirm known mechanisms and highlight new biology for
further investigation.

Monocyte/macrophage and neutrophil interaction in severe patients are dominated by CXCL,
IL1 and other inflammation pathways
Focusing on individual pathways, Fig. 3A illustrates that all pathways can be broadly grouped into six
large clusters. In particular, two of these pathway-clusters (pathway-cluster 2 marked by orange and
pathway-cluster 4 marked by pink) are dominated by inflammatory pathways and these have
significantly higher interaction between monocytes and neutrophils in severe patients compared to
moderate (Fig. 3A-B). This is consistent with findings that in the productive immune response to
SARS-CoV-2 infection, alveolar macrophages recognize and phagocytize apoptotic cells; however,
under a dysfunctional immune response, excessive activation and accumulation of
monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils leads to the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines which
then damages the lung and other organs (35, 36).

To further delineate differences between moderate and severe patients observed in Fig. 2D (shown by
thick red edges between monocytes and neutrophils), we investigated which subpopulations of

monocytes actively interact with neutrophils (Supplementary Fig. 6A-B). The two inflammatory
pathway-clusters mentioned above show that different cellular subtypes of monocytes in severe
patients have significantly higher interaction scores in different pathways (Fig. 3B). More specifically,
we found that in severe patients, cellular subtype “monocyte 1” interacts with neutrophils through IL1,
and CCL pathways, whereas interactions in moderate patients are dominated instead by TNF.
Supplementary Fig. 6C-D shows that “monocyte 1” is marked by genes IL1B, IL1RN, IL8,
TNFRSF1B and CCL4 and characterized by gene ontology terms “regulation of inflammatory
response” as well as “regulation of apoptotic signaling pathways”. The cellular subtype “monocyte 2”
(marked by highly expressed IFI27), interacts primarily with neutrophils through pathways ANNEXIN
and GALECTIN, which could suggest a role for this cluster in phagocytizing dying neutrophils. The
cellular subtype “monocyte 3” expressing IFIT2, IFIT3, CCL8, CXCL10, and CXCL11 shows strong
signatures of type 1 interferon cell-cell signaling (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. 6C), suggesting
equal support for antiviral immunity in moderate and severe patients. Alternatively, proinflammatory
signaling via CXCL interactions is mainly through cellular subtype “monocyte 4”, which highly
expresses CCL2, CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL5 (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. 6C).

Similar patterns are observed in the monocyte-neutrophil interaction in BALF (24) tissues where
patient samples with neutrophils have higher interaction signaling from monocytes through pathways
CXCL, IL1, GALECTIN, ANNEXIN, and CCL (Fig. 3D) demonstrating the consistency of our cellcell interaction results across nasopharyngeal and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples. The impact of
CXCL and IL1 are also found among the four sets of longitudinal samples in the Chua dataset under
different disease progression, suggesting an increase in interactions of signaling pathways CXCL, IL1
over time (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, ANNEXIN downregulates across time in severe patients, but
increases in moderate patients (Fig. 3C).

Interaction from goblet cells to immune cells are heterogeneous in moderate patients and severe
patients
We observe heterogeneous interaction patterns from goblet cells to immune cells across patients and
pathways (Fig. 4A). Goblet cells are found to express high levels of genes associated with innate and
antiviral immune functions indicating that the nasal epithelial cells interacting with immune cells may
play an important role in reducing early viral load and this is also consistent with recent literature (37).
We observe one subgroup of severe patients (n = 3; including one deceased patient) showing clear
differences in cell-cell interaction within the pathway-cluster 1 compared to moderate patients. In
particular, they show a lack of interaction in the collection of pathways which includes immune
signaling and costimulation pathways such as CD40, CD80, CD23 and CD86 inflammatory pathways
IL6, IFN-II, and Th2 cytokines IL-4/IL10 (Fig. 4A). Another subgroup of severe patients (n = 6) show
clusters with a small subgroup of moderate patients that has low cell-cell interaction for antigen
presentation (MHC-II), signaling pathways PTN and NPR2, and this subgroup is also lacking the Th2
cytokine IL-4 and the B cell activating factor BAFF (Fig. 4A). Together, these results point to cohort
heterogeneity within severe patients implicating immune costimulation or T cell polarizing pathways
may contribute to disease severity with context.

Focusing on a specific cellular subtype of epithelial cells (goblet 5), we observe a number of increased
activities in moderate patients in the ANNEXIN pathway. This is most evident between cellular
subtypes “goblet 5” and “monocyte 5”. This epithelial to immune cell interaction within the
ANNEXIN pathway also shows an increase in patients under moderate conditions (Fig. 4B). Annexin
plays a role in phagocytic uptake of dying cells, can drive neutrophil detachment and apoptosis, and
plays a predominant role in immune resolution (38). Remarkably, glucocorticoids, which are effective
at treating COVID-19 patients, act via upregulating Annexin I (39), suggesting that natural moderate
symptoms for COVID-19 may be linked to effective endogenous immune management, or that patients

that respond to glucocorticoid drugs elevate Annexin cell communication pathways that then limit
further inflammation, and this response is detectable via single-cell analysis. We have developed and
provide an interactive resource (http://shiny.maths.usyd.edu.au/CovidCellInteraction/) to enable further
investigation of cell-cell interaction at different resolutions from aggregate interaction between two
major cell types to visualize expression values for specific ligand-receptor pairs.

Cell-cell interaction patterns have the potential to discriminate between moderate and severe
patients
Finally, we found that information from cell-cell interactions provides a discriminating signal for
patients with different disease progression. Fig. 4C shows the principal components of the cell-cell
interaction matrix for the Chua dataset with samples from healthy controls, moderate and severe
patients highlighted. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) shows that based on accuracy, ligandreceptor features selected based on interaction from epithelial (ciliated and goblet) cells to immune
cells (LOOCV = 0.8) has a higher discriminating power than using cell type proportion (LOOCV =
0.4) or ligand and receptor gene expression alone (LOOCV = 0.6). Examples of top selected pathways
are THBS, BMP and EGF from pathway-cluster 1, and MHC-II and COMPLEMENT from pathwaycluster 2 (pathway-cluster defined in Fig. 4A). This result is consistent regardless of the statistical
machine learning methods employed (Supplementary Table 1). The accuracy rate of leave-one-out
cross-validation (LOOCV) based on the first three PCs using k nearest neighbor classification (k = 3)
is 84.4%, highlighting the ability of cell-cell interaction features to predict the degree of severity of
patients. By repeating our workflow on the three PBMC datasets, we further demonstrate that using
CCI features can achieve higher LOOCV accuracy rate than using cell type composition as features.
Despite the limited samples, repeating our workflow on a smaller dataset within BALF tissues in the
Liao dataset demonstrates similar findings that cell-cell communication patterns between goblet cells
to immune cells has potential discriminating power.

Discussion
A better understanding of virus and host cell interaction at the cellular level is an important component
in understanding infectious disease progression and is critical for developing a treatment for the
disease. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive workflow to integrate and examine multiple
COVID-19 single-cell RNA-seq datasets to identify differential cell-cell interaction (CCI) pathways
with respect to disease. Our initial results in upper airway tissues show strong intra-epithelial
communication in the healthy lung, whereas the immune system then dominates communication
pathways during COVID-19. We then discover that despite a higher cell-cell interaction (tCCI score)
in severe patients compared to moderate patients between immune and neutrophil cells, the CCI scores
between epithelial and immune cells are heterogeneous among severe patients, with a subpopulation
illustrating lower CCI score when compared to moderate patients. Furthermore, features extracted from
cell-cell interactions are potential signatures for discriminating between moderate and severe patients.

In most multi-omics profiling in patients with COVID-19, strong acute inflammatory responses are
commonly found in most of the cell types as expected. Since the airway epithelium is the primary site
of infection for SARS-CoV-2 causing disease, investigating how epithelial cells interact with immune
cells differentially leads to a better understanding of the initial host reaction to viral infection.
Therefore, examining cell-cell communication offers an analytical approach to characterize specific
cell type interaction and identify potential immune response drivers that results in different degrees of
disease severity.

The importance of using a workflow that accounts for cohort heterogeneity in examining severe and
moderate patients is clearly illustrated when we examine the interaction pattern between nasal
epithelium as a ligand and various receptors in immune cells. This is a different approach to the one

taken by Chua and colleagues (25), where they measure the overall/aggregate interaction between
epithelial and immune cells and found a higher overall/aggregate interaction between epithelial and
immune cells in severe patients. Here, when we examine the cell-cell interaction relationships at the
individual sample level, we observe clear cohort heterogeneity among severe patients, and we are able
to discover a subgroup of the moderate patients with higher interaction between epithelial and immune
cells.

In this study, we focus on the cell communication within COVID-19 patients via ligand-receptor
signaling. Several methods have been developed recently to infer such cell-cell interaction from
scRNA-seq data, such as CellPhoneDB, SingleCellSignalR, NicheNet and CellChat (20–22, 40). Most
of these methods aim to identify the significant ligand and receptor gene pair between two cell
populations with the most recent method CellChat (22) that accounts for additional signaling factors.
In addition, CellChat systematically categorizes the ligand-receptor pairs based on their signaling
pathways, providing a comprehensive interpretation of cell-cell communication from single-cell RNAseq. There are also other types of cell communication like physical cell interaction that can be further
investigated. Technology to sequence physically interacting cells like PIC-seq has been used to
investigate epithelial–immune interaction and infectious disease in mice (41). Application of such
technology in COVID-19 research will potentially allow characterization of differential physical
intercellular interaction at high resolution.

Our analysis suggests the heterogeneity of cell-cell interaction patterns within patients, even if they
have similar degrees of symptoms. One key variability is the sampling time since the onset of
symptoms, as this may not fully capture the true underlying disease progression within each individual.
Other potential factors that lead to the variability include age, gender, comorbidities and viral load.
Currently, with the limited number of samples from patients with similar clinical characteristics,

accounting for these uncertainties in modelling is challenging. Towards the future, as more large
single-cell profiling resources in COVID-19 become publicly available, integrative analysis and metaanalysis of these studies by incorporating patient diversity to our workflow will provide a more
comprehensive characterization of cell-cell interaction patterns in COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless,
using the current databases our workflow supports that cell-cell interactions provide more meaningful
predictions of disease progression (Figure 4C).

In summary, our novel workflow enables integrative analysis of five different COVID-19 scRNA-seq
data sets with a total of 415,856 cells and 85 samples. This generalizable workflow was built on the
latest single-cell analytical methods and enables the identification of differential cell-cell interaction
across disease progression. We discover clear cohort heterogeneity among the severe patients in the
interaction between epithelial and immune cells, with signatures that can be linked with patient
outcome. Together we provide a validated workflow for integration and analysis of diverse single-cell
sequencing data to pinpoint communication networks that control disease outcome.

data contains 6 healthy controls, 3 moderate patients and 4 severe patients.
[D] Arunachalam dataset - The raw count matrices of single-cell RNA-seq data from PBMC and the
clinical information were downloaded from GEO under accession number GSE155673. This data has 5

mitochondrial proportion and UMI count greater than 50,000 are removed from the downstream
analysis.
[E] Zhang dataset - The raw sequence files of single-cell RNA-seq data from PBMC are downloaded
from the Genome Sequence Archive of the Beijing Institute of Genomics (BIG) Data Center, BIG,
Chinese Academy of Science using the accession code HRA000150 (18). Cell Ranger (v3.0.2) with
human reference version GRCh38 were used to generate the raw count matrices. The data includes 5
healthy controls, 7 moderate patients and 4 severe patients. Only the cells retained from the original
study are used.

Processing: For each dataset, we performed size factor standardization and log transformation on the
raw count expression matrices using the logNormCount function in the R package scater (version
1.16.2) and generated log transformed gene expression matrices for analysis.

Computational workflow
Step 1 - Cell type annotation - For a given dataset, we perform a cell type identification using the
scClassify framework (19). Specifically, to identify the cell types from the Chua dataset and the Liao
dataset, we performed a modified version of the joint classification from scClassify that incorporates

the concept of iterative supervised learning. The initial model is built from four reference datasets
including annotated cell information from healthy human lungs (4, 26, 27). The final cell type labels
were determined by the majority vote from individual classification labels using each single reference.
An additional scClassify model based on the assigned cells was then built to predict the cells that are
classified as “intermediate” or “unassigned” in the previous step. To identify cell types from the
PBMC datasets, we used the Wilk dataset as a reference (28) to build the model and use it to predict
the cell types for the Zhang dataset and the Arunachalam dataset.

Step 2 - Unsupervised clustering for subpopulation identification - We performed unsupervised
clustering on each classified cell type to identify the cellular subtypes in the Chua dataset and the Liao
dataset. For each cell type, we first calculate the deviance across cells within each sample using the
function devianceFeatureSelection implemented in the R package scry (version 1.0.0) .
Next, we select features that are among the top 1000 largest deviances in more than 50% of the
samples. We then performed negative binomial generalized principal component analysis (GLM-PCA)
on the UMI matrix with the selected features (number of components is set to 30) (42). A shared
nearest neighbor graph is then built based on the GLM-PCA low-dimensional space and used as an
input for Louvain clustering to identify subclusters, considering each of them as a refined cellular
subtype.

To prevent over clustering, we follow a similar workflow described in clusterExperiment to collapse
the identified subclusters (23). Hierarchical clustering is first performed on the aggregated average
expression of each subcluster to construct a cluster hierarchy, and then from the bottom to top, the

that are inconsistently annotated between the original Chua dataset and scClassify (classified as goblet
cells). In this instance, based on marker expression, we manually reannotated these two cell types
using the original annotation for the downstream analysis.

Step 3 - Calculating cell-cell interaction (CCI)
For a given individual sample and a pair of subclusters (i.e. cellular subtypes) obtained in Step 2, we
calculate the aggregated ligand-receptor interaction score based on CellChat (22) for each signaling
pathway. This represents the communication probabilities among all pairs of subclusters across all
ligand-receptor pairs. The CellChat algorithm aims to identify the significant ligand-receptor gene
pairs between two cell populations while accounting for important signaling factors, including the
expression of soluble agonists, antagonists, and stimulatory and inhibitory membrane-bound coreceptors. Finally, the communication probability of a signaling pathway is defined as the sum of the
probabilities of its ligand-receptor pairs.

The implementation is available as R code stored at the GitHub,
https://github.com/SydneyBioX/COVID_CCI_analysis and as a web shiny application at
http://shiny.maths.usyd.edu.au/CovidCellInteraction/.

Statistical formulation
The output of the cell-cell interaction analysis can be considered as a three-dimensional array
representing the cell-cell interaction (CCI) score. Let 𝑥!"# denote the cell-cell interaction (CCI) score
generated from the computational workflow for a pair of cellular subtypes 𝑐, where 𝑐 ∈ 𝐶 (defined
below as a set consisting of all pairs of cellular subtypes), pathway 𝑝 with 𝑝 = 1, . . . , 𝑃, and individual

sample 𝑘 with 𝑘 = 1, . . . , 𝐾. In general, an individual sample 𝑘 represents the sample from one
individual collected at a specific time point.

For 𝑁 major cell types, we denote them by the sets 𝑀$ , 𝑀% , . . . , 𝑀& and within a given major cell type
𝑀' consisting of 𝑛' cellular subtypes 𝑚'$ , 𝑚'% , . . . , 𝑚'(! we can write 𝑀' = {𝑚') |𝑢 = 1, . . . 𝑚, 𝑛' }. We
can represent a pair of cellular subtypes as 𝑐 = 6𝑚') , 𝑚*+ 7, where 𝑖, 𝑗 = 1, . . . , 𝑁; 𝑢 = 1 , . . , 𝑛' and
𝑣 = 1, . . . , 𝑛* . Here, we consider 𝑚') as the sender cellular subtype within major cell type 𝑀' and 𝑚*+
as the receiver cellular subtype from major cell type 𝑀* . The collection of all pairs of cellular subtypes
is written as 𝐶 = <6𝑚'), 𝑚*+ 7|𝑖, 𝑗 = 1, . . . , 𝑁; 𝑢 = 1, . . . , 𝑛' ; 𝑣 = 1, . . . , 𝑛* =. We further denote 𝐶-! ,-" as
a subset of 𝐶 containing only pairs of cellular subtypes from major cell type 𝑀' to 𝑀* which is
represented as 𝐶-! ,-" = <6𝑚') , 𝑚*+ 7|𝑚') ∈ 𝑀' ; 𝑚*+ ∈ 𝑀* =.
For a given sample 𝑘, the following measures of interest are explored:
● Subtype cell-cell interaction (sCCI) between a pair of cellular subtypes 𝑐 for an individual
sample 𝑘 is calculated as sCCI (𝑐, 𝑘)= @" 𝑥!"# . This measure totals the cell-cell interaction
score across all pathways. Calculating this score for each pair of cellular subtypes and each
individual sample is the same as totaling the array 𝑋 across the pathways resulting in a |𝐶| × 𝐾
two-dimensional matrix.
● Pathway specific cell-cell interaction (pCCI) from the major cell type 𝑀' to the major cell type
𝑀* for a pathway 𝑝 and an individual sample 𝑘 is pCCI 6𝑀' , 𝑀* , 𝑝, 𝑘7 = @!∈/

𝐶-! ,-" is defined as above. This is a measure that sums the cell-cell interaction scores across all
cellular subtypes between any two major cell types. For each pair of (𝑀' , 𝑀* ), calculating this
statistic for each pathway 𝑝 and individual sample 𝑘 results in a 𝑃 × 𝐾 matrix (see Figure 3A).

defined as above. This is a measure that sums the cell-cell interaction scores across all cellular
subtypes between two major cell types and across all pathways. For each individual sample 𝑘,
calculating the tCCI statistic for each pair of (𝑀' , 𝑀* ) will result in a 𝑁 × 𝑁 matrix that can be
visualized as a heatmap or network graph.
● Suppose 𝒫 represents a set of pathways belonging to the same cluster termed as a pathwaycluster (see Clustering in Methods). The pathway-cluster cell-cell interaction for an individual
$

sample 𝑘 between a pair of cellular subtypes is defined as psCCI(𝑐, 𝒫, 𝑘)= |𝒫| @"∈𝒫 𝑥!"# .

Association analysis for CCI
We calculate a group specific cell-cell interaction (CCIgroup ) between two cellular subtypes where
groups represent any treatment of interest. Here it refers to control and disease progression such as
moderate and severe patients. Let 𝒦group denote a set of individual samples under the same condition
of interest, where |𝒦group | indicates the size of the set. For example, the total number of samples
having moderate response to COVID-19 in the dataset (see Fig. 2 A-C). The CCIgroup from the major
cell types 𝑀' to the major cell types 𝑀* can be calculated by
CCIgroup 6𝑀' , 𝑀* , 𝒦group 7= |𝒦

scaling function to scale between individual samples. In practice, the differential CCI from 𝑀'
to 𝑀* between moderate (CCImoderate ) and severe (CCIsevere ) patients can be calculated by CCIsevere −
CCImoderate measuring the differential patterns of the cell-cell interaction across different disease
severity (see Figure 2D).

The pathway-cluster cell-cell interaction (used in Figure 3B) for a group of individuals ℒ between a
pair of cellular subtypes is simply the sums of psCCI across individual with a group ℒ and can be
written as <𝒦

∑#∈𝒦group psCCI(𝑐, 𝒫, 𝑘). For a pair of cellular

subtypes 𝑐, calculating this statistic results in a |𝒫| × |𝒦group | matrix.

Statistical analysis of longitudinal data
Suppose we have multiple samples collected from the same individual at different time points, say
𝑘early and 𝑘late then the cell-cell interaction across disease progression is the log-ratio of cell-cell
interaction (illustrated in Fig. 3C) between these two time points for a given pair of cell types (sender
cell type 𝑀' , receiver cell types 𝑀* within a pathway 𝑝 is log SpCCI6𝑀', 𝑀* , 𝑘late 7/pCCI6𝑀', 𝑀* , 𝑘early 7T.

Clustering
We group various pathways based on the similarity of intercellular communication patterns using
hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance and ward.D2 agglomerative method implemented in the
function hclust in R.

PMBC data integration
We integrate the three PBMC datasets using a modified version of scMerge (30). Here, cell types
annotated by scClassify are used as an input to scMerge to construct pseudo-bulk expression profiles.
The resulting profiles are used to identify mutual nearest subgroups as pseudo-replicates and to
estimate parameters of the scMerge model.

Machine learning for discrimination
To select the cell-cell interaction features that discriminate across samples under different conditions,
we performed a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test on pathway-specific cell-cell interaction (pCCI) to select
the pathways that are significantly different across samples from healthy controls, moderate patients
and severe patients. Feature selection is based on pCCI features with an adjusted p-value less than 0.1
for the Chua dataset, less than 0.2 for the Wilk and Zhang datasets and less than 0.4 for the
Arunachalam dataset, we termed these selected features as “Top CCI”. For the Chua dataset, we also
selected the top pCCI from the cell-cell interaction between the two major epithelial cell types (Goblet
and Ciliated) and the immune cell types (B cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes and T cells),
termed as “Epi-Immune CCI”. We further considered cell type proportion as another type of feature.
The classification model to predict the samples’ condition is built with linear discriminant analysis
(LDA) and random forest (RF) on the selected features (Top CCI, Epi-Immune CCI, and cell type
proportion) as well as k nearest neighbor classification (with k = 1, 3) using the first 3 principal
components of the pCCI matrix. The classification performance was determined by leave-one-out
cross-validation.

Gene Ontology analysis
Differential gene expressions were identified using moderated t-statistics implemented in the R
package limma (version 3.44.3). The gene set over-representation analysis for the significant DE
genes (top 100 genes selected) with biological process (BP) gene ontology is measured using the
“enrichGO” function in the R package clusterProfiler (version 3.16.0) (43). Significant GO
term is defined by q-value < 0.1.

To facilitate the interpretation of the complex data set, we have created an online interactive tool which
allows researchers to explore different parts of the data. The first tab of the tool contains four columns.
The first column allows the user to select two groups (or individual samples) to compare and it
displays the associated cell-cell interaction network. The second column shows the difference between
the two selected groups (or samples) in a heatmap and network form. Selecting a cell type pair from
the heatmap dissects the interaction into individual pathways and sub-cell types, displayed in the third
column. Selecting a pathway on this heatmap further dissects the activity into individual ligandreceptor pairs, displayed in the fourth column. The second tab of the tool allows the user to select a
gene and its mean expression is shown for each cell type and sample. The user can also select a ligand
cell type and a receptor cell type and the activity of all pathways between these cell types and
involving the selected gene are shown.

LOOCV accuracy rate for four datasets using four classification methods: KNN (K = 1), KNN (K = 3),
linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and random forest (RF). The row “Top CCI” refers to
classification results based on features selected by Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test on pathway-specific
cell-cell interaction (pCCI) (See Material and Methods section for more details). The row “EpiImmune CCI” refers to classification results based on features selected from the cell-cell interaction
between the two major epithelial cell types (Goblet and Ciliated) and the immune cell types (B cells,
dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes and T cells). The row “cell type proportion” refers to
classification results based on the cell type proportion. The highlighted cells indicated the best
performing signature(s) for each of the classification methods.
