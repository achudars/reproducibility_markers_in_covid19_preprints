Abstract
Background: Immune system conditions of the patient is a key factor in COVID-19 infection survival. A
growing number of studies have focused on immunological determinants to develop better biomarkers for
therapies.
Aim: The dynamics of the insurgence of immunity is at the core of the both SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
development and therapies. This paper addresses a fundamental question in the management of the infection:
can we describe the insurgence (and the span) of immunity in COVID-19? The in-silico model developed here
answers this question at individual (personalized) and population levels.
We simulate the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and analyze the impact of infecting viral load, affinity
to the ACE2 receptor and age in the artificially infected population on the course of the disease.
Methods: We use a stochastic agent-based immune simulation platform to construct a virtual cohort of
infected individuals with age-dependent varying degree of immune competence. We use a parameter setting
to reproduce known inter-patient variability and general epidemiological statistics.
Results: We reproduce in-silico a number of clinical observations and we identify critical factors in the
statistical evolution of the infection. In particular we evidence the importance of the humoral response over

the cytotoxic response and find that the antibody titers measured after day 25 from the infection is a prognostic
factor for determining the clinical outcome of the infection.
Our modeling framework uses COVID-19 infection to demonstrate the actionable effectiveness of
simulating the immune response at individual and population levels. The model developed is able to explain
and interpret observed patterns of infection and makes verifiable temporal predictions.
Within the limitations imposed by the simulated environment, this work proposes in a quantitative way
that the great variability observed in the patient outcomes in real life can be the mere result of subtle variability
in the infecting viral load and immune competence in the population.
In this work we i) show the power of model predictions, ii) identify the clinical end points that could be
more suitable for computational modeling of COVID-19 immune response, iii) define the resolution and
amount of data required to empower this class of models for translational medicine purposes and, iv) we
exemplify how computational modeling of immune response provides an important view to discuss hypothesis
and design new experiments, in particular paving the way to further investigations about the duration of
vaccine-elicited immunity especially in the view of the blundering effect of immunesenescence.

1 Introduction
The global pandemic set up by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the
early months of the year 2020 has reached considerable proportions and, to date, does not show signs of
slowdown when considered globally. In fact, as of 9:45am CET, 19 December 2020, there have been
73,996,237

confirmed

cases

of

COVID-19,

including

1,663,474

deaths,

reported

to

WHO

(https://covid19.who.int).
The mortality rates, of the SARS-CoV-2 greatly differ across the globe, ranging from 0.5 to 13% (Johns
Hopkins University, https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality), as a result of many
factors including the ability to react to the pandemic by the various national health systems.
The COVID-19 disease has a quite variable clinical presentation: while the majority of individuals present
with a very mild disease, often asymptomatic, a few patients develop a life-threatening disease requiring
intensive care. The strongest determinant of disease severity is age, with children presenting almost exclusively
with mild disease, while individuals over 70 years of age are much more likely to develop severe COVID-19
(Reference?). This variation is likely due to both host and pathogen factors. Host factors may include
differences in the immune response due to genetic determinants and immunological history. On the other hand,
pathogen factors include transmission, entry and spread within the host, cell tropism, virus virulence and
consequent disease mechanisms.
To better understand what impact these factors may have in the differences observed in the host response
to SARS-CoV-2, we set up the analysis of the dynamics generated by a computer model that considers both,

the magnitude of the viral harm, and the subsequent innate and adaptive response set up to attempt achieving
control of the infection. Thus we used computer simulations to create a virtual cohort of infected individuals
to study the effects on the pathogenesis of both host and pathogen factors. Note that this approach goes beyond
the machine learning paradigm as the knowledge is generated through a set of equations/algorithms confirmed
by the scientific literature and by past models. The simulation allows systems-level, multi evidence analyses
to simultaneously capture the dynamics of the major immune cell populations and the many protein mediators
by which cells communicate, in order to sort out the determinants of disease severity.

2 Simulating SARS-CoV-2 course of events in the host
The simulation model that we used in this study, C-IMMSIM, is a derivation of an established software
system for the simulation of the immune response to generic pathogens [1]. It is equipped with a fundamental
innate immune response consisting in macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer cells, and represents the
adaptive immunity by B lymphocytes, plasma B antibody-producing lymphocytes, CD4 T helper and CD8
cytotoxic T lymphocytes. It is a polyclonal model as it embodies the primary sequences of binding sites of Bcell receptors (BCRs) and T-cell receptors (TCR), as well as the peptides and epitopes of the infectious agent
(i.e., the SARS-CoV-2 in this case).

resulting from the infection by the SARS-CoV-2, provides a varying degree of efficiency of the immune
response which, as it turns out, correlates with the parameters defining both the immunological competence
(IC) of the virtual host and the virus definition.

It represents a portion of, i) primary lymphatic organs where lymphocytes are formed and mature (i.e.,
mainly the red bone marrow and the thymus gland), ii) secondary lymphoid organs (e.g., a lymph node), which
filters lymph, and where naïve B and T-cells are presented to antigens, and, iii) peripheral tissue which is
dependent on the pathogen considered (in this case the lung).
While primary organs are just the source of lymphocytes equipped with a randomly generated receptor
(actually only its complementarity-determining region, CDR), the secondary organs and the tissue are mapped
onto a three-dimensional Cartesian lattice. The thymus is implicitly represented by the positive and negative
selection of immature thymocytes [2] before they enter the lymphatic system [3], while the bone marrow
generates already immunocompetent B lymphocytes.
C-IMMSIM incorporates several working assumptions or immunological theories, most of which are
regarded as established mechanisms, including the clonal selection theory of Burnet [4], [5], the clonal deletion
theory (e.g., thymus education of T lymphocytes) [2], [6], the hypermutation of antibodies [7]–[9], the
replicative senescence of T-cells, or the Hayflick limit (i.e., a limit in the number of cell divisions) [10], [11],
T-cell anergy [12], [13] and Ag-dose induced tolerance in B-cells [14], [15], the danger theory [16]–[18], the
(generally unused) idiotypic network theory [19], [20].
Being more a general-purpose modeling platform rather than just a model, C-IMMSIM lend itself to
characterise the role of the immune response in different human pathologies such as viral infections (e.g., HIV
or EBV [21], [22]), cancer immuno-prevention [23], [24], type 1 hypersensitivity [25] and the chronic
inflammation associated to type 2 diabetes [26] as well as specific aspects of the immune dynamics such as
lymphocytes homing in lymph nodes [27], the gene regulation leading to cell differentiation [28], clonal
dominance in heterologous immune responses [29] and also vaccination-eliciting fish immunity [30]. Relevant
to the present study, the model has recently being used to simulate the response to a multi-epitope vaccine
against SARS-CoV-2 [31], [32].
In C-IMMSIM each simulated time step corresponds to eight hours of real life. Cells diffuse randomly in
the represented volume and interact among them. Upon specific recognition through receptor bindings, they
perform actions which determine their functional behaviour. These actions are coded as probabilistic rules and
define the transition of the interacting cell entities from one “condition” to another. In fact, each rule is
executed only if the parts involved are in specific states (e.g., naïve, active, resting, antigen-presenting).
Besides cell-cell interaction and cooperation, this model simulates the intra-cellular processes of antigen
uptake and presentation. Endogenous antigens are fragmented and combined with MHC class I molecules for
presentation on the cell surface to CTLs’ receptors (this is the cytosolic pathway), whereas exogenous antigens
are degraded into small pieces, which are then bound to MHC class II molecules for presentation to T helpers’
receptors (this is the endocytic pathway).
The stochastic execution of the algorithms coding for the dynamical rules, results in a sequence of
cause/effect events culminating in the production of effector immune cells and setup of immunological

memory. The starting point of this series of events is the injection of an antigen which, here, consists of the
virus. This may take place any time after the simulation starts (the sequence of events of the SARS-CoV-2
simulation is reported in Appendix A). Initially the system is “naïve” in the sense that there are neither T and
B memory cells nor plasma cells and antibodies. Moreover, the system is designed to maintain a steady state
of the global population of cells (homeostasis), if no infection take place.
Besides the parameters defining the characteristics of the virus related to attachment, penetration,
replication and assembly (i.e., its fitness), the SARS-CoV-2 virus in this model is defined as a set of B-cell
epitopes and T-cell peptides consisting of amino acid 9-mers and defining its antigenicity. If the infection is
stopped or becomes persistent or even kills the virtual patient it depends on the dose of the virus, its fitness,
and the strength of the immune response aroused. All of these variables determine if, and to what degree, the
success of the immune system requires the cooperation of both the cellular and the humoral branch, as shown
in past simulation studies [33].
With respect to previous version of the model described in [34] the most important difference is that to
improve the peptide-prediction performance, rather than using position-specific-score-matrices (PSSM) to
weight the binding contribution of the amino-acids composing the protein segments in the bounds [35], [36],
we resort to pre-computed ranked lists of T-cell epitopes calculated with the original neural network
NetMHCpan method [37]–[39]. This feature, which is described below, follows the choice of a definite HLA
set.

2.1 Selecting the HLA haplotype
The C-IMMSIM model accounts for differences in the HLA haplotype when determining which peptides
are presented by antigen presenting cells. To this end, it takes in input a list of such peptides for each HLA
molecule considered together with a propensity of each peptide to bind to it. This list is computed by using
third party immunoinformatics tools as described in the next section 2.2.
The

“HLA

haplotype

search”

in

the

“Allele

Frequency

Net

Database”

(http://www.allelefrequencies.net) was used in order to select two HLA-A, two HLA-B and
two DRB alleles which are most prevalent in US population [40]. The result pointed to the following alleles:
HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*24:02, HLA-B*35:01, HLA-B*40:02, DRB1*07:01 and DRB1*15:01.

2.2 Computing the peptide immunogenicity
The strain of SARS-CoV-2 used in this study corresponds to the reference sequence NCBI Reference
Sequence: NC_045512.2. The primary structure of these proteins have been used to identify cytotoxic T
peptides (CTL peptides) and helper T peptides (HTL peptides). To this aim we have employed two
immunoinformatics tools. In particular, for the definition of CTL epitopes, the “ANN 4.0 prediction method”

was used for the prediction of 9-mer long CTL peptides which had an affinity for the chosen set of HLA class
I alleles (i.e., HLA-A*02:01, HLA-A*24:02, HLA-B*35:01 and HLA-B*40:02) [41]–[43]. The peptides were
classified as strong, moderate and weak binders based on the peptide percentile rank and IC50 value. Peptides
with IC50 values <50 nM were considered to have high affinity, <500 nM intermediate affinity and <5000 nM
low affinity towards a particular HLA allele. Also, lower the percentile rank, greater is meant the affinity [41]–
[43]. The list of peptides is reported in the Appendix B.

The predicted peptides were classified as strong, intermediate and non-binders based on the concept of
percentile rank as given by NetMHCII pan 3.2 server with a threshold value set at 2, 10 and >10% ,
respectively. In other words, peptides with percentile rank ≤2 were considered as strong binders whereas a
percentile rank between 2 and 10% designate moderate binders; peptides with percentile score >10 are
considered to be non-binders [44]. The list of CTL and HTL peptides and the relative affinity score is reported
in the Appendix C.

2.3 Quantifying the immunological competence
It is widely accepted that ageing is accompanied by remodelling of the immune system. With time, there
is a decline in overall immune efficacy, which manifests itself as an increased vulnerability to infectious
diseases, a diminished responses to antigens (including vaccines), and a susceptibility to inflammatory
diseases. The most important age-associated immune alteration is the reduction in the number of peripheral
blood naïve cells, accompanied by a relative increase in the frequency of memory cells. These two alterations,
are extensively reported in the literature and account for the immune repertoire reduction [45], [46]. Along
with the process called "inflamm-aging", the reduction of immune repertoire is considered the hallmark of
immunesenescence [47].
To model the reduction of immune efficacy we first defined the parameter “immunological competence”
IC∈(0,1] and assumed it in a simple linear relationship with the age. Specifically we set 𝐼𝐶 ≡ 𝐼𝐶(𝑎𝑔𝑒) = −𝛼 ∙
𝑎𝑔𝑒 + 1 with the value of the parameter 𝛼 = 45 ∙ 10!" determined using epidemiological data as described
below. Given the age, the parameter IC is then used to modulate both innate and adaptive immunity as follows:
i) the phagocytic activity of macrophages and dendritic cells, represented by a probability to capture a viral
particle, is rescaled respectively as 𝑝# = 𝐼𝐶 ∙ 𝑢 and 𝑝$% = 𝐼𝐶 ∙ 𝑣, where 𝑢~𝑈[',)] and 𝑣~𝑈[+×',+×)] are two
random variables uniformly distributed in the ranges [𝑎, 𝑏] and [5 ∙ 𝑎, 5 ∙ 𝑏] with 𝑎 = 25 × 10!" and 𝑏 =
10!- ; ii) as for the adaptive immunity it is adjusted according to the immunological competence parameter IC

by decreasing the lymphocyte counts (hence B, Th and Tc) to reflect a reduction in the repertoire of “naïve”
cells with immunological history due to accumulation of memory cells filling the immunological compartment.
In particular, the number of white blood cells 𝑁 is computed as 𝑁~𝐼𝐶 ∙ 𝒩(𝜇, 𝜎 - ) = 𝒩(𝐼𝐶 ∙ 𝜇, 𝐼𝐶 - ∙ 𝜎 - ) where
𝒩(𝜇, 𝜎 - ) is a normal distribution with average 𝜇 and standard deviation 𝜎 (for each lymphocyte type B, Th
and Tc) chosen to reflect the reference leukocyte formula for an average healthy human adult (see Figure 2)
[48].

Figure 2 Modified lymphocytes counts by age class. Given the chosen value of 𝛼, the immunological
competence is less than one, therefore by increasing the age, the cell numbers are drawn by a normal
distribution with reduced mean value 𝜇 ∙ 𝐼𝐶(𝑎𝑔𝑒) and reduced variance (𝜎 ∙ 𝐼𝐶(𝑎𝑔𝑒))! .

2.4 Adapting the model to SARS-CoV-2 characteristics
The infection and the dynamical features of the SARS-CoV-2 viral strain has been characterised by two
parameters: i) 𝑉. corresponding to the infectious viral load at time zero, and, ii) the affinity of the virus spike
protein to the ACE2 receptor on target cells, called 𝑝/ . In particular, 𝑉. ~𝑈[0! ,1! ] has been taken randomly in
the interval [𝑐2 = 5, 𝑑2 = 5 ∙ 10+ ], while 𝑝/ ~𝑈[0" ,1" ] in the interval [𝑐- = 10!3 , 𝑑- = 10!2 ].
Upon choice of the age class determining the immunocompetence value IC(age) hence p and p

as well

as the lymphocyte counts, the simulations depict the immune-virus competition eventually culminating in a
successful, or not, virus-clearing response controlling its growth. Sometimes this control is not perfectly
efficient. In those cases the result is a longer viral persistence possibly going much beyond the length of the
observation period of 30 days (cf. Figure 4).
The sequence of events from viral infection leading to a full fledged immune response is detailed in the
Appendix A. At each time step of the simulation C-IMMSIM dumps all variables allowing for a detailed analysis
of the dynamics. A full output example of a simulation is reported and described in the Appendix D.

3 Modeling a representative cohort of infected individuals
We have simulated a large number of infections by varying the parameters identifying both the viral
characteristics and the individual immunological competences. The seven age classes considered were 0-9,
10-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79 and 80+. As already mentioned, the age class determines the
immunocompetence parameter 𝐼𝐶 which, in turn, sets 𝑝# and 𝑝$% as well as the lymphocytes counts in the
in-silico individual, we can characterize each simulation by the set of parameters (𝐼𝐶(𝑎𝑔𝑒), 𝑉. , 𝑝/ ).
Moreover, due to the stochasticity of the model depending on the random number realisations, each simulation
corresponds to a different trajectory in the space of the variables. It follows that each simulation coincides with
an in-silico patient with variable immunological characteristics (𝐼𝐶) and, at the same time, infected by a
slightly different viral burden (𝑉. and 𝑝/ ).
The intervals within which these parameters vary have been chosen to reproduce the age-class incidence
of disease severity of infected individuals. The age-class incidence varies wildly among regions mostly due to
a different definition of COVID-19 related deaths. Moreover, due to the lack of confirmation of the causes of
death in many cases in periods of high emergency as that of March/April 2020 in Italy, these rates should not
be considered strictly but rather indicative of the negative exponential-like relationship of the death incidence
with age. Reference values we used were the fatality rates from the the Chinese Center for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) as of 17th February, the Spanish Ministry of Health as of 24th March, the Korea Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) as of 24th March, and the Italian National Institute of Health, as
presented in the paper by Onder et al. (2020) as of 17th March [49], [50].
To reproduce this age-related incidence of in-silico cases we linked the simulated viral load at a certain
time to the clinical status (clinical endpoint). This has been done according to the rationale that a patient whose
viral load is still quite high after thirty days from infection can be considered at very high risk of death. In fact
in most mild cases, the clinical signs and symptoms (mostly fever and cough) have been reported to resolve
within 3 weeks from the diagnosis (which translates in approximately 30 days from infection). Instead after 3
weeks several authors have described severe cases with progressive deteriorating multi-organ dysfunction with
severe acute respiratory dyspnea syndrome, refractory shock, anuric acute kidney injury, coagulopathy,
thrombocytopenia, and death [51].

3.1 Stratifying the in-silico cohort of patients
The analogy of some simulation variable to a realistic clinical endpoint allow us to stratify the in-silico
patients for a more concrete interpretation of the results. We were able to classify the virtual patients on the
basis of the viral load observed at day thirty (indicated by 𝑉3. ) and a threshold 𝜃 in one of the three classes:
•

Critical: if 𝑉3. > 𝜃, namely, the viral load at day 30 is still high; this class includes weak and late

responders;

•

Partially recovered: those who are still positive but have a low viral load, meaning that the immune

response is controlling the viral replication (i.e., 0 < 𝑉3. ≤ 𝜃); note that this class includes the asymptomatic;
Fully recovered (or just Recovered): those who have cleared the virus (i.e., 𝑉3. = 0).

•

According to this definition by choosing the cutoff 𝜃 =120 viral particles per micro-litre of simulated
volume, we obtain the stratification of the virtual individuals shown in panel A of Figure 3. Altogether, i.e., of
all in-silico individuals, we get 4.3% of critical cases (broken down in age-classes in panel A), 46.8% of
partially recovered (panel B), and 48.8% recovered cases (panel C). These figures sound very much in line
with current epidemiological statistics when considering that the recovered cases here simulated include
asymptomatics [50].

cases are in agreement with [50].

This results shows an interesting and surprisingly high fraction of in-silico patients in the partially
recovered class. This class, in fact, includes patients that, at the end of the simulated period of thirty days, are
still positive albeit manifesting an active immune response, regardless being asymptomatic or not. This
question is discussed below.

These special cases can be better examined in Figure 4, which shows four distinct exemplifying runs with
different outcomes. In the panel A the viremia is shown as a function of time. Red lines correspond to
individuals who reach the critical condition 𝑉3. > 𝜃 thus falling in the class critical. The green line corresponds
to a viral clearance corresponding to a fully recovered case, and the blue line shows a situation in which the
virus is not completely cleared but stays below the threshold value 𝜃. This case corresponds to one of what we
call partially recovered as it represents virtual individuals that produce an immune response (cf. same figure,
panel B showing the corresponding antibody titers) which turns out to be insufficient to clear the virus. These
“unresolved infections” include asymptomatic cases and are worth the further analysis described below.
To note that the two examples of critical outcome (red curves) originate from a quite different initial viral
load. Also to note that the fully recovered (green) case starts with a viral load that is higher than one critical
case, still the immune response manage to control the infection. The blue curve shows a partially recovered
case which greatly decrease the viral load (inset plot of panel A) but does not clear it completely.

3.2 How the model explains symptoms
It is worth to clarify that the term “symptom” has no meaning in the in-silico framework until we specify
the link between model variables and possible clinical endpoints. Also we should note that we have no concept
of comorbodity here that would help in defining the “status” of the virtual patient. To overcome this limitation,
besides the viral load at day 30, we think up the following quantities (or variables) as clinical endpoints: (a)
the damage in the epithelial compartment, namely, percent of virus-target cells that are dead at the time of
observation as surrogate marker of vascular permeability; (b) the concentration of pyrogenic cytokines as a
surrogate marker of fever, i.e., Prostaglandins TNFa, IL-1 and IL-6 causes fever people get varying degree of
severity with COVID-19.

Figure 5 Distribution of epithelial damage 𝜙 of the cohort cases classified in critical and non-critical. A
delimiting value 𝜙" = 0.63 separates well the two classes.

Of these two potential surrogate marker of criticality, the first appear more appropriate. In fact, while the
amount of pyrogenic cytokines (surrogate clinical endpoint b.) correlates with the severity of the disease, the
most striking difference in the critical cases versus the non critical (i.e., recovered plus partially recovered) is
seen when comparing the accumulated damage in the epithelial compartments (𝜙) computed as the fraction of
depleted epithelial cells due to the immune cytotoxicity of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells during the whole
observation period (surrogate clinical endpoint a.),

where 𝐸(𝑡) is the epithelial count per micro litre of simulated volume and T is the time horizon of 30 days
(note that 𝜙 ∈ [0,1]). Indeed, when we plot the distribution of 𝜙 for the cases in the critical and non critical
(i.e., partially recovered plus fully recovered) classes separately we obtain what shown in Figure 5. The plot
clearly shows that for critical in-silico patient the damage is much more pronounced than for non critical ones.
This prompt us to use the threshold 𝜙0 = 0.63 to set apart patients which have mild infections (about 80% as
in reality [52]–[54]) to those having severe disease (15% with dyspnoea, hypoxia, lung changes on images
[55]) or critical illness (5%, respiratory failure, shock, multi organi dysfunction, cytokine storm syndrome
[56]), that is, we label patients with 𝜙 ≥ 𝜙0 as symptomatic while those with 𝜙 < 𝜙0 asymptomatic.
According to this further stratification patients who are still positive (i.e., 0 ≤ 𝑉3. < 𝜃) and have no symptoms
(i.e., 𝜙 < 𝜙0 ) account for about 44% of the simulations which is in line with current estimates of asymptomatic
incidence

3.3 A high viral load carries a serious risk
We tested the correlation between the antigen abundance (or infective viral load V ) and the severity of the
0

infection. The Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) test shows significant (i.e., p-value< 10!3 ) difference
between infecting viral load V in the three classes critical, partially recovered, recovered. In particular we
0

find that a higher V is a strong correlate of disease severity [57]. Of interest is the fact that there is no
0

significant difference among age groups, that is, V is not predictive of the disease severity with respect to the
0

age [58] (MWW test p-value>0.05).

3.4 IL-6 correlates with disease severity but youngers generate more
Significantly, in most critically ill patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a severe clinical
inflammatory picture based on a severe cytokine storm that is mainly characterised by elevated plasma
concentrations of interleukin 6 [59]. In this scenario, it seems that IL-6 owns an important driving role on the
cytokine storm, leading to lung damage and reduced survival [60].

Figure 6 IL-6 concentration (log-scale) correlates positively with the viral load measured at the peak (i.e.,

recovered and recovered with no significant difference in the degree of correlation.

The simulation agrees on this finding as the plot in Figure 6 shows. Plotting the peak value of the viral
load (i.e., the maximum value attained in the observed period) versus the logarithm of the integral of IL-6 over
the whole period (cf. eq(2) in next section 3.5), we see a positive correlation no matter the outcome (recovered,
partially recovered, critical).

For all age-classes, a critical clinical course is associated to a significantly higher concentration of proinflammatory cytokine IL-6. Panel B of Figure 7 shows the same information for all age-classes lumped
together and the difference is statistically significant. The cytokine concentration on the y-axis is calculated as
the integral over the whole simulated period (definition in eq(2) of section 3.5). The positive correlation
between inflammation and severity of the clinical course is a consequence of the struggle of the immune system
to cope with the infection. However what panel A of Figure 6 reports is a generic higher production of IL-6 in
younger individuals compared to elders. The explanation of this outcome becomes visible following the line
of consequences starting from a stronger cytotoxic activity (see panel B of Figure 12 below) that killing
infected cells cause a stronger release of danger signal to which macrophages respond by secreting IL-6. Since
younger have a higher immunological competence (IC), they respond with both stronger cytotoxic response
and better innate (i.e., macrophage) activity. The result is the somehow counterintuitive observation that while
younger individuals are more inflammed, they have a smaller propensity to experience severity of the disease.

section 3.5.

3.5 Younger individuals deal with the virus producing more
cytokines
What observed in the production of IL-6 in younger individuals extends to all cytokines produced during
the response to the inflammation. In fact we find that, in general, cytokines’ cumulative production during the
whole simulated period correlates inversely with the age. Calling 𝑐5 the concentration of cytokines x in the
simulated volume, where x is one of IL-6, D, IFNg and IL-12, we define

the cumulative value of cytokines in the whole observation period. Figure 8 shows 𝜎678 , 𝜎$ , 𝜎69:; , and 𝜎672with respect to age. What Figure 8 shows is that there is a clear reduction of cytokines’ production with age.
This, similarly to what discussed in the previous section, is due to the reduced immune activity which indeed
is determined by a reduced immunological competence with the age [62]. To justify the apparent contrast of
this finding with the fact that elder acute infected individuals are more prone to experience a cytokine storm
we should openly regard to one of the limitation of the model, namely, the lack of further cytokine feedbacks
that are activated during the course of an extended pneumonia.

Figure 9 Severe cases are associated to a lower concentration of IFNg. IFNg is measured as the area
under the curve (i.e., the integral in the simulation time window).

The inverse correlation of interferon-gamma (IFNg) with disease severity is observed in all age groups
(panel A and also in panel C when summing all ages-classes). Interestingly, recovered and partially recvovered
do not show a meaningful difference when compared to the critical cases (panel C).
IFNg is released by natural killer (NK) cells upon bystander stimulation by danger signals (Rule n.5 in
Appendix A) which, in turn, is released by infected/injured epithelial cells upon viral infection (Rule n.3) and
when killed by cytotoxic cells (Rule n.18). This analysis lead us to state that a prompt activation of NK cells
in younger individuals due to a higher immunological competence, and a stronger cytoxic response killing
infected cells, controls the “acute” production of danger signal impacting on the production of IFNg.

3.7 Cytokine storm goes with symptoms
If we use the cumulative value of inflammatory cytokines as variable, namely, 𝜎69:< + 𝜎678 + 𝐷 + 𝜎4:9'
(i.e., the sum of the integrals) and we use the accumulated damage in the epithelial compartments, that is, the
fraction of depleted epithelial cells due to the immune cytotoxicity 𝜙 defined in eq(1) (cf. section 3.2) as the
discriminating criteria between symptomatic and asymptomatic, we observe what is shown in Figure 10.

Figure 10 Compare the “cytokine storm” in the two groups asymptomatic 𝜙 < 𝜙" and symptomatic 𝜙 ≥ 𝜙" .
Panel A shows the histogram, panel B compares the wiskers. The difference is statistically significant (pvalue< 10#$ ).

Compared with asymptomatic cases, the symptomatic ones more frequently have a markedly higher levels
of inflammatory cytokines. The difference of the virtual patients in the two classes is statistically significant
(MWW test, p-value< 10!3 ), which is in line with the clinical finding that show higher inflammatory level in
severe disease progressions [63]. This result seems to contrast what stated in section 3.5, namely that younger
individuals produce more cytokines but have a less-severe course of the disease. However the explanation
provided by the simulation is that those who deal with the infection more rapidly (those including
asymptomatics) produce, overall, a smaller amount of cytokines, thus are at lower risk of having a “cytokine
storm”. On the other hand, an inconclusive immune response chronicisizing the inflammation results in
pronounced symptoms (e.g., extended epithelial damage) and ultimately in a cytokine storm.

3.8 Why the immune response is quicker in younger individuals
It has been suggested that in younger individuals several factors contribute to the lower numbers of patients
obseved with severe disease, namely: lower number of ACE receptors, overlapping immunity against
coronaviruses and a more efficient intact immune system.

Figure 11 Panel A shows for each age class, the days elapsed from infection until the viral load starts to
decrease. This is indicated as 𝑡 %!"# = max{𝑉(𝑡)} since it means the distribution of the time when the antigen
&

reaches the peak. It is a measure of how quick the immune defences are mobilised, hence its speed. Panel B
shows the corresponding distribution of 𝑡' = min{𝑉(𝑡) ≤ 𝜃}, namely the time it takes for the immune response
&

to bring the viral load to fall below 𝜃. It is a measure of the efficiency of the immune response in clearing the
infection.

Indeed Figure 11 shows that the immune response is quicker in younger virtual individuals compared to
elder ones. The speed of the immune response is calculated in terms of the time (in days) the viral load 𝑉(𝑡)
reaches its maximum (indicated 𝑡𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥 where 𝑡: 𝑉(𝑡) = 𝑉 ()* and 𝑉 ()* = max 𝑉(𝑡)) and starts to decline due to
&

𝑉𝑚𝑎𝑥

the immune response. Panel A of Figure 11 shows the distribution of 𝑡

for each age class. Clearly, younger

individuals develop a faster response and consequently the virus is cleared earlier. This is shown in panel B
which plots the distribution of the time (in days) it takes the immune response to decrease the viral load below
the threshold 𝜃 whenever this happen (the cases for which 𝑉(𝑡) > 𝜃, ∀𝑡, are not counted in this statistics).
Panel B is in line with the fact that younger individuals mount a quicker immune response that is generally
more efficient than those in elder people thus eradicating the virus in a shorter time.

3.9 The key role of the humoral response
Figure 12 shows that younger individuals have a higher production of antibodies when compared to elder
individuals. This is evidente for both critical and recovered (partial or fully recovered) individuals. However
the most striking observation when considering the difference between recovered and critical cases is the gap
in antibody titers present in virtually all age classes (panel A). This indicates a strong protective role of the
humoral response making a split between recovered and critical patients.
Panel B of Figure 12 shows the corresponding statistics for the cytotoxic T cell (peak value) count per ageclass and critical status. This plot consistently evidences that youngers have a stronger response than elders.

Interestingly, in contrast to the humoral response, in all age classes the cytotoxic response in critical individuals
is higher than in recovered ones revealing the attempt of the immune system to counterbalance the unefficacy

Figure 12 The relationship between magnitude of the immune response and age is maintained also when
looking at antibodies and cytotoxic cells. Panel A shows the antibody titers for all age classes comparing
recovered with critical patients. Panel B panel shows cytotoxic cell (Tc) counts (peak values).

Moreover, a further view at the antibody titers reveals that its peak value (i.e., 𝑉 @'5 = max 𝑉(𝑡))
A

correlates inversely with the clearance time (𝑡? ), that is, faster response are obtained with a lower production
of antibodies (cf. Figure 13). This is in line with the hypothesis that asymptomatic individuals develop a rapid
but mild response which clears the infection [64].

It should be noted, however, that there are still substantial uncertainties on the data available due to the
variable diagnostic accuracy of different serological tests for COVID-19, therefore more well designed large
clinical studies are warranted to address this matter ([65], [66]). Interestingly, the same can not be said when
cosidering peak values of Tc counts, that is, the cytotoxic response does not correlate, either positively or
negatively, with time-to-clearance (not shown).

4 Discussion and conclusions
The immunological correlates of COVID-19 are far from being clearly elucidated in clinical studies.
Simulation studies can help disentangling the importance of factors such as a reduced ability to mount an
efficient (i.e., not off target) immune response due to age or the infective viral load determining the initial viral
burden.
We have set up a computational model that simulates the infection with a varying dosage of the virus and
with a slightly different affinity to the ACE2 receptor of target cells, in individuals with different
immunological competence.
The results of a large number of simulations that we call virtual or in-silico cohort, demonstrates that the
great variability observed in the real pandemic can be the mere result of such diversity in both viral and human
characteristics.
The computational model used is able to explain a number of clinical observations of SARS-CoV-2
infection and to evidence the importance of the humoral response in discriminating an efficient from a poor
immune response failing to completely clearing the infection and, in some cases, bringing the viral load down
below a threshold value and, at the same time, without showing markers of symptoms.
The model has been tuned for parameters able to reproduce the relationship of age with the disease severity
(cf. Figure 3). Starting from that, any other observation revealed an emergent property of such complex
simulation environment. In particular we observe the correlations among infective viral load 𝑉. and severity,
among immunological (in)competence (thus age) and severity, among the overall cytokine levels and
symptoms (i.e., a virtual cytokine storm), and, finally, the key role of the humoral response in clearing the
infection yet sustained by the cytotoxic activity (cf. Figure 12). Importantly, we have identified day 25 after
infection (which we can roughly associate to about day 15th-18th after the appearance of the symptoms) as the
time for a predictive measurements of the antibody response to assess the risk of developing a severe form of
the diseases. Before that time, our data suggest that the prediction is not statistically meaningful.
The model is restricted in a number of aspects. It simplifies reality and works with a limited number of
mechanisms and a reduced diversity. Moreover, it does not reproduce diverse organs and tissues and therefore

we cannot observe site-specific pathological problems, including the spatial extension of pneumonia.
Nevertheless the analysis conducted in the present work accounts for such limitations and the results obtained
can be reasonably considered independent of such restrictions.
Of course there are some cases reported in the literature in which the course of infection has been extremely
long, expecially in severly immunocompromised patients. However, the very complex and lenghty dynamics
taking place in those cases are beyond the scope of this study, which instead represent at large the majority of
observed cases.
Finally, we should consider that the clinical ground of observation inevitably starts much later than in our
model, as people ask for medical attention only after developing symptoms or after knowing of accidentally
having been in contact with patients/carriers. Therefore the window of observation we consider in this paper
is recapitulating more precisely the infection dynamics of the early days.
Potential study directions should cover the duration of immunity, either natural or induced by the vaccine,
including ways to indirectly verify it, the impact of immunesenescence on the elicited immunity or the
combined effect of monoclonal antibody and vaccines in potential future terapies.
Despite the extraordinary complexity of the immune system dynamics, the progress of simulation
platforms suggests that a more intense interaction between clinicians and researchers in computational model
could bring these models to the desidered quality for deployment in the medical field.

Appendices
Appendix A. The sequence of events from virus infection to immune
response
The system is in a stable state (apart from random flucuations due to natural cell death/birth of cells) until
an antigen is injected. In this case the virus SARS-CoV-2 is applied at day 0. It follows a sequence of stochastic
events promoting cells duplication, cytokine secretion and eventually culminating in the humoral and cellular
immune response. Due to the high degree of details of the angorithms enacting such events, an agent-based
model is not described by means of mathematical formulas but rather by Rules expressed in natural language
without sacrifycing rigor. The Rules of the automaton accounting for the main part of the C-IMMSIM ABM of
the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 are listed below. Each rule corresponds to a more-or-less complex
algorithm whose details are here neglected because less relevant to the purpose of the present article (more can
be found in previous publications of the model).
1. Infection: An infection dose V(0)=V is injected into the simulated volume
0
2. Endocytosis: the virus enters epithelial cells (EP)
3. Biosynthesis: the viral RNA and viral proteins are made and assembled into new virions that are released by
budding (exocytosis) from infected cells (SARS-CoV-2 follows a lysogenic cycle, that is, it does not kill the host).
At this stage, infected/injured EP
•

DAMPs release: release danger signal (D) (generally indicating interferon, cytokines, DAMPs = damage
associated molecular patterns)

•

Inflammation: release IL-6

•

Endocytic presentation: process the viral proteins leading to their presentation on class I HLA molecules

4. B phagocytosis: B cells phagocyte, internalise, process and present viral peptides on class II HLA
5. Response to Danger:
•

NK response: Natural killer cells (NKs) release IFNg upon bystander stimulation by danger

•

M response: Macrophages (M) respond to danger (e.g., DAMPs) via TLR4 releasing TNFa and IL-6

6. M activation: macrophages become activated by IFNg (activated M have a greater phagocytic activity)
7. Active M

•

M phagocytosis: M internalise, process and present viral peptides on class II HLA; in presence of IFNg they
release IL-12; they also release TNFa

•

DC activation: M release TNFa which activate dendritic cells (DC)

8. DC phagocytosis & endocytosys: DC phagocyte, internalise, process and present viral peptides on class II HLA
(exocytic pathway) but also on class I HLA (endocytic pathway)
9. Th activation: in presence of danger signal, resting T helper lymphocytes are activated by interaction with peptidebound HLAs on professional antigen presenting cells (M and DC, mainly DC) surface by means of specific
interaction with their T-cell receptors (TCR); if no danger is present, the Th cells becomes anergic upon interaction
of its TCR with the HLApepide complex
10. Th stimulation by APCs: activated Th interacting with antigen presenting cells (M, DC)

Th duplication: start clone expansion; part of the clones become memory cells

•

Th cells release IL-2

•

M release IL-6

•

Th1 release IFNg

and IL23, active T helper cells undergo class switch into Th1 and Th2
13. B differentiation: B cells differentiate to antibody-secreting plasma B cells (PLB)
14. Isotype switch: B cells perform immunoglobulin class switching, that is, change production of immunoglobulin
from the isotype IgM to the isotype IgG
15. Antibodies production: Plasma cells secrete antibodies

16. Humoral response: antibodies inhibit viral particles by opsonization; the result are the immuno-complexes that are
eventually cleared by macrophages
17. Tc activation: in presence of IL-2, resting cytotoxic T cells (Tc) are activated by the interaction of their TCR with
DC presenting on class I HLA the viral peptides but only in presence of IL-2
18. Tc duplication: activated Tc interact with infected EP cells presenting viral peptides on class I HLA molecule
•

Cytotoxic response: kill infected EP (this will further release danger signal)

•

Tc start duplication

Appendix B. HLA class I peptide list
Each column reports the peptides relative to the allele indicated in the first row. Each entry of the table
shows the peptide, the rank score and the relative amino acid position. The relative rank score is used to directly
compute the probability to successful bind the peptide to the HLA molecule thus presenting the HLA-peptide
complex to the cell surface.

Each column reports the peptides relative to the HLA indicated in the first row. Each entry of the table
shows the peptide and the relative rank score. The relative rank score is used to directly compute the probability
to successful bind the peptide to the HLA molecule thus presenting the HLA-peptide complex to the cell

Appendix D. Example readout of a simulation
Figure 15 shows in panel A how the viral load 𝑉(𝑡) (both soluble, meaning outside infected cells, and
proviral, meaning inside infected cells, and the sum of the two), varies with time: the viral particles of SARSCov-2 injected at day 0, peaking at about day 5 and start to decline after that and in correspondance to the
appearance of antibody producing plasma cells (panel B of Figure 16). In the same panel the immunoglobulins
titers are plotted (split in IgM and IgG, further split in IgG1 and IgG2) together with the immunocomplexes
(IC) that are antibodies bound to viruses (i.e., opsonised viruses). This plots shows a humoral response surging

at abouty day 12 and clearing the virus in about five days. It also shows that the antibody levels remains high
for some time after the simulation ends at day 30.
Panel (B) plots in arbitrary scale the cytokine concentrations for interleukins, interferon and danger signal
(inset plot of the same panel). In particular this run shows a high level of IFNg, IL-6, IL-2 and IL-12 elicited
by the infection besides a moderate production of danger signal (D, in the inset plot of panel B). Release of
cytokines follows from the dynamical rules characterising the agent’s behaviour reported in Appendix A.

Figure 15 Viral load 𝑉(𝑡), immunoglobulins (IgM and IgG) and the immunocomplexes (IC) are shown in
panel A. The same panel shows the viral particles of SARS-Cov-2 injected at day 0, peaking at about day 5
and start to decline after that and in correspondance to the appearance of antibody producing plasma cells
(panel B of Figure 16). Panel B shows the cytokines generated during the immune response (see text for
details).

Panel A of Figure 16 shows the total counts of the B-cells in all phenotypes, that is, memory and not
memory, and the three isotypes IgM, IgG1 and IgG2 (i.e., cells that will become plasma B cells producing IgM
or IgG antibodies).
Panel B shows the count of antibody-generating plasma cells subdivided in the three classes IgM, IgG1
and IgG2.
Panel C gets into the details of the ABM simulation model by showing the counts of B-cells subdivided
according to the internal state assemed. Worth to note that the cells enter the duplication state only after day
10 and until day 20 because besides presenting the viral peptides on their HLA molecules, they need to be
stimulated by stimulated cognate helper T cells bearing the “correct” cell receptor (panel D of same Figure
16). Note also that upon clearance of the virus (cf. panel A of Figure 15) the B-cell population switches back
to the “active” state and terminates the presentation of the viral proteins.
Panel D shows cell counts for CD4 T-cell population (total number, memory cells, not memory). Some
days after the infection and upon successful interaction with antigen presenting cells, T helper lymphocytes
start to duplicate and differentiate into memory. They also foster cytotoxicity (cf. panel A and B of Figure 17)
and humoral response (cf. panel B of Figure 16) through secretion of cytokines (panel B of Figure 15). As for

B cells in panel A, panel E shows Th counts specifying the internal state of the lymphocyte thus revealing the
“activation” phase starting quite soon before day 5 and the duplication phase starting immediately after and
ending at about day 20. Of note, some cell become anergic around day 15 for lack of “danger” (second) signal

Panel A of Figure 17 plots the cell counts for CD8 T-cell population (total number, memory cells, not
memory). Panel B shows the counts per internal cell state revealing a limited number of anergic cells (numbers
on the y2-axis), the early activation of a large number from day 3 (and corresponding decrease of resting cells)
entering a duplication phase peaking ad day 5 but progressing through about day 18.
Panels C and D show the total number and the breakout counts for antigen presenting cells DC (denritic
cells in panel C) and MA (that we also indicated as M, macrophages, in panel D). In particular the presentation
activity following the internalization of the virus by macrophages terminates at about day 20. Similar behaviour
is shown in panel E for dendritic cells. Interestingly more macrophages are activated following Rule n.6 (in
Appendix A) due to the high level of IFNg released by natural killer cells (cf. Rule n.5 in Appendix A) upon
bystander stimulation by danger signals (or damage associated molecules, cf. panel B of Figure 15) segreted
by infected cells.
