Abstract
To interfere with the biology of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic,
we focused on restoring the transcriptional response induced by infection. Utilizing expression
patterns of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, we identified a region in gene expression space that
was unique to virus infection and inversely proportional to the transcriptional footprint of known
compounds characterized in the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures. Here
we demonstrate the successful identification of compounds that display efficacy in blocking
SARS-CoV-2 replication based on their ability to counteract the virus-induced transcriptional
landscape.

These compounds were found to potently reduce viral load despite having no

impact on viral entry or modulation of the host antiviral response in the absence of virus. RNASeq profiling implicated the induction of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway as the underlying
mechanism of inhibition and suggested that targeting this aspect of host biology may
significantly reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load.

Introduction
A zoonotic transmission of an airborne virus capable of rapid spread has always been a
potentially devastating threat to human society; this risk has only increased with globalization.
Indeed, the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has proved an unprecedented global challenge.
As the scientific community works fastidiously to learn more about the biology of the virus and
develop a vaccine, there is a pressing need to identify therapeutics to reduce morbidity and
mortality. To better understand the basis of the disease, initial efforts have focused on
determining how different cell types and tissues respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Blanco-Melo
et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Ziegler et al., 2020). These efforts have generated a high-level
understanding of how virus replication correlates with induction of the antiviral response and the
changes in cellular processes. In general, a viral infection results in the production of numerous
inflammatory triggers which can include aberrant RNA, misfolded proteins, and/or damage to
the cell (Devarkar et al., 2016). In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the virus appears to mask aberrant
RNA to prevent a robust induction of the cellular antiviral response. However, the processes of
SARS-CoV-2 replication still result in a unique transcriptional footprint that presumably
accommodates the virus life cycle (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020). Here we attempt to leverage this
information to predict compounds that counter these conditions by inverting transcriptional
signatures.
Ideally, in the face of a pandemic we would be able to deploy a pan-antiviral that universally
targets a transcriptional footprint common to all viruses. As viruses are obligate parasites, they
almost exclusively require host machinery to effectively replicate and spread, making it difficult
to develop an antiviral nontoxic to the host. Adding to this challenge is the fact that every human
pathogen antagonizes some portion of the cellular antiviral response making each
transcriptional landscape unique (García-Sastre, 2017). While development of family-specific
antivirals has had success with viruses such as orthomyxoviridae (Krammer et al., 2018). and
human immunodeficiency virus (Gulick and Flexner, 2019), such antivirals still do not exist for
the coronavirus family. In the absence of a pan-specific coronavirus drug, or a SARS-CoV-2
vaccine, the next most useful tool would be the effective repurposing of FDA-approved drugs.
As this expansive list of compounds has been characterized in humans for toxicity and delivery,
identified compounds could be immediately deployed should they show beneficial effects. So
far, most drug repurposing efforts involve computational predictions via structural biology,
network analysis, or in vitro drug screens (Gordon et al., 2020). Until now, these drug screens
have produced low overlap (Kuleshov et al., 2020), a phenomenon likely due to many variables

including the screen’s readout or the choice of cell platform. There is underutilized opportunity to
understand the global molecular changes these drugs induce by using available sequencing
data from diverse models and cell types.
The library of integrated network-based cellular signatures (LINCS) is an NIH consortium
working to define multi-omics footprints for pre-clinical and approved drugs (Keenan et al., 2018;
Subramanian et al., 2017). This resource serves as a promising computational method to find
compounds which may counter or mimic the gene expression changes induced by a given
perturbation. By comparing changes in gene expression before and after drug treatment, and/or
viral infection, we can identify transcriptional irregularities that are inversely correlated between
these two groups. Applied here, such an approach may methodically identify antivirals whose
mechanisms of action are based in returning cells to homeostasis while impairing virus
replication.

As past efforts successfully utilized the LINCS resource to identify drugs that

attenuate Ebola virus in cell-based assays (Duan et al., 2016), here we applied this approach to
identify antivirals for SARS-CoV-2. By analyzing expression profiling of SARS-CoV-2 infected
cells, we identified a high-dimensional region in expression space unique to this virus, namely
cholesterol biosynthesis, whose perturbation interferes with virus biology. These drugs were
validated in multiple cell-based assays including SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells, A549ACE2
cells, and in human organoids. In all, these efforts identified four promising drug candidates:
amlodipine, loperamide, terfenadine and berbamine which each inhibit the virus independent of
viral entry.

Results
In a recent study (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020), we applied gene expression profiling to generate
transcriptional signatures from lung cultures infected with SARS-CoV-2. Those analyses
revealed that virus infection resulted in robust replication and a strong cellular response. As a
follow up, we used the RNA-seq data collected from these studies and processed them using
BioJupies (Torre et al., 2018) to create differential expression signatures (see methods). These
signatures were then used as queries against the LINCS L1000 dataset, a collection of gene
expression profiles generated following the administration of >20,000 bioactive compounds
including >1,000 FDA-approved drugs to human cell lines at a variety of different times and
concentrations (Subramanian et al., 2017) With L1000FWD (Wang et al., 2018), we could
identify reciprocal transcriptional signatures generated between SARS-CoV-2 infection and a
given compound. Specifically, we identified a common region in the L1000FWD expression

amlodipine, RS-504393, and chlorpromazine as having potential therapeutic value against
SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1A). In support of these findings, it is noteworthy that loperamide,
berbamine, and trifluoperazine were recently reported as hits in an independent drug screen for
compounds that block SARS-CoV-2 infection in African Green Monkey kidney (Vero-E6) cells
(Jeon et al., 2020).
The transcriptional signature implicating the aforementioned compounds include 50 genes
down-regulated by the virus that are consistently up-regulated by these drugs (22 out of 50/50,
p-value<2.1e-46, Fisher exact test; and 5 out of 50/50/50, p-value<1.7e-20, empirical
simulations) (Figure 1B). Overall, based on the L1000 data, these seven compounds influence
the same pharmacological high-dimensional gene expression signature space and are predicted
to disrupt key cellular processes that are modulated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Moreover, the expression signatures induced by all seven drugs across multiple cell-line
contexts are highly correlated (Figure S1A). In addition to leveraging the L1000 data, we also
examined the top 100 genes co-expressed with ACE2, the established receptor of SARS-CoV-2
(Hoffmann et al., 2020), based on correlations computed across thousands of diverse RNA-seq
datasets (Lachmann et al., 2018). We then searched for FDA-approved compounds that induce
or suppress the expression of these genes using drug signatures extracted from other
independent transcriptome studies (Wang et al., 2016). This approach identified one additional
compound, quercetin, as an effector of these ACE2 co-expressed genes (Figure S1B). Hence,
all together, eight drugs were selected to be tested for efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Next, we examined whether these eight drugs influenced SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero-E6
cells by applying them at the same concentration used in the L1000 experiments (10μM) with
the exception of quercetin (40μM), which was determined based on the concentration used in
the top matching signatures extracted from GEO (Mutch et al., 2006). Out of the eight drugs,
seven drugs completely abolished the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid when
administered one hour prior to infection (Figure 2A). Quercetin was the only drug where the viral
nucleocapsid remained present, while chlorpromazine induced cytotoxicity and therefore was
not characterized further (Figure S2A). We next tested the remaining seven drugs in more
relevant

cell-based

models.

adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial (A549) cell line that constitutively expresses
ACE2 (herein referred to as A549ACE2). We next pre-treated these cells with terfenadine,
loperamide, berbamine, trifluoperazine, amlodipine, and RS-504393 and infected cells with
SARS-CoV-2. In agreement with our Vero-E6 results, these data demonstrated that all six
drugs successfully blocked virus replication (Figure S2B). These results could be further
corroborated at an RNA level by performing quantitative RT-PCR based on the 5’ transcriptionregulatory sequence (TRS) and the 3’ end of the N open reading frame which confirmed the
effect of the six remaining drugs in both Vero-E6 (Figure S2C) and in A549ACE2 cells (Figure 2B).
Lastly, to assess how these compounds impact viral growth, we performed plaque assay from
the supernatant of treated A549ACE2 cells and found that terfenadine and berbamine completely
inhibited the production of progeny virions below the limit of detection whereas loperamide,
trifluoperazine, amlodipine, and RS-504393 all significantly reduced viral output by 2-3 orders of
magnitude (Figure 2C). To determine if inhibition was mediated by a block in viral entry, we
tested each compound for the capacity to block Renilla luciferase activity delivered by a
recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 Spike.

These data

found that entry was not impacted in response to any of the tested compounds (Figure 2D).
To further understand the molecular basis for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, we next
administered the drugs to A549ACE2 cells both in the absence and presence of virus and
measured genome-wide gene expression with RNA-seq under all these conditions. As
expected, in the absence of virus we observe that the six drugs induce expression signatures
comparable to those generated by processing the L1000 data (Figure 3A, Figure S3A, and
Tables S1-13). STRING annotation prediction software of differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
demonstrated overlapping annotations between different drug treatments including the induction
of cholesterol biosynthesis (GO:0006695), amino acid biosynthesis (GO:1901607), protein
metabolism (GO: 1903364), and a downregulation of cell cycle (GO: 0007049) (Figure 3C).
These transcriptional changes are also evident in the presence of virus infection and can be
viewed individually on the corresponding volcano plots (Figure 3C-I). These data agree with
qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis (Figure 2 and Figure S2). Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 viral
reads per million reads (RPM) in the RNA-seq data are 3 magnitudes lower in the six drugtreated compared to DMSO-treated A549ACE2 populations (Figure 3B). Taken together, these
annotation signatures implicate cholesterol biosynthesis and cell cycle as the two most
prominent pathways modulated by the administration of these compounds. However, as there
are thousands of other L1000 compounds known to impact cell cycle, these data would

implicate cholesterol biosynthesis as the predominant mode of action in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2
in these assays.
To further assess the global effects of these drugs, we next applied them to human pluripotent
stem cell-derived pancreatic endocrine organoid cultures, previously shown to support robust
SARS-CoV-2 replication (Yang et al., 2020). In addition to testing the drugs for their ability to
attenuate infection, we also performed genome-wide RNA-seq profiling to examine the effect of
these drugs on the human pancreatic organoid cultures. Principal component analysis of
infected organoids found that all these samples formed three major clusters in this
transcriptional space defined by variance one and two (Figure 4A). These data demonstrate
that PCA-1 could be largely defined as an uninfected vs. infected signature. One exception to
this was berbamine, which formed a unique cluster for both variance one and two. When this
same data was mapped on variance two and three, one could observe greater separation
between the non-berbamine drug treatment and DMSO – reflecting the changes to cholesterol
biosynthesis (Figure S4A).
Aligning captured reads to a SARS-CoV-2 reference genome, we find that while trifluoperazine
and RS-504393 demonstrated only modest reduction of viral load, loperamide, terfenadine,
amlodipine, and berbamine all successfully reduced virus transcription by approximately three
orders of magnitude (Figure 4B). While genes involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway
are still upregulated in DEG analysis (Figure 4D-I, Tables S14-20), the most upregulated GO
annotation in amlodipine and terfenadine is the type I interferon signaling pathway, and in
berbamine treated human organoids is the regulation of signal transduction (Figure 4C),
indicating a more nuanced mechanism of action in this more biologically relevant tissue model.
Trifluoperazine and RS-504393 treated organoids’ lack of enrichment is reflected in decreased
efficacy to lower viral reads (Figure 4B).
Taken together, these data suggest that the small molecules capable of reversing the
transcriptional landscape induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a bona fide means of
identifying novel antiviral therapeutics.

While additional in vivo testing will be required to

ascertain whether amlodipine, berbamine, loperamide, and/or terfenadine represent effective
antivirals against SARS-CoV-2, the findings outlined here also provide us with a greater
understanding of virus-host interactions.

Discussion
Here we identified several potential drug repurposing candidates based on analysis of published
RNA-seq and L1000 gene expression data. Specifically, we identified a region in the
pharmacological gene expression space that regulates cholesterol biosynthesis that appears to
negatively impact virus replication. This led us to predict seven drugs as potential SARS-CoV-2
inhibitor candidates: terfenadine, loperamide, berbamine, trifluoperazine, amlodipine, RS504393, and chlorpromazine. Loperamide is an over the counter approved drug used to treat
diarrhea which is one of the symptoms of COVID-19. Berbamine is an experimental drug
extracted from a shrub native to Japan, Korea, and parts of China (Greathouse and Rigler,
1940). It is an alkaloid and a channel blocker that was previously shown to display anti-lungcancer (Duan et al., 2010) and anti-inflammatory activity (Jia et al., 2017). Trifluoperazine was
shown to block Epstein-Barr virus (Nemerow and Cooper, 1984), while amlodipine is an
approved drug for blood pressure and chest pain (angina) (Chahine et al., 1993). Amlodipine
was recently reported to improve the outcome of patients with COVID-19 (Solaimanzadeh,
2020; Zhang et al., 2020). The preclinical drug RS-504393 is a known CCR2 antagonist that
blocks CCL2 signaling in sepsis (Souto et al., 2011). Hence, its modulation of the immune
response may interfere with SARS-CoV-2 host interactions. Terfenadine was withdrawn from
the market in 1997 after 12 years due to evidence for cardiac toxicity via the binding to the
hERG channel yet may still provide short term benefit as a SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic or acute
treatment (Roy et al., 1996). Chlorpromazine was shown to block Epstein-Barr virus (Nemerow
and Cooper, 1984) and influenza A virus (Krizanova et al., 1982) and very recently was found to
be effective against SARS-CoV-2 in multiple in-vitro assays (Plaze et al., 2020), although we
ruled it out early due to cellular toxicity.
These seven drugs were first tested in Vero cells by two independent cell-based assays with six
of them showing positive results. The six most promising compounds were then tested in
A549ACE2 cells and in pancreatic endocrine human organoids. The six drugs significantly
diminished SARS-CoV-2 infection in A549ACE2 cells, and four out of six of these drugs also
inhibited the virus in the human organoid model. RNA-seq profiling of A549ACE2 cells and the
organoids in the presence of these drugs showed that berbamine displays quite different
transcriptional effects compared with the other compounds. It has a more pronounced effect that
is opposite in expression space, bringing the tissue closer to its normal uninfected state. It
should be noted that the module of genes that are up regulated by the identified compounds is
known to be targeted by commonly used cholesterol lowering drugs. It was suggested that

statins may be considered as a potential treatment (Castiglione et al., 2020), but there is some
evidence that statins may increase COVID-19 infection (Shrestha, 2020). While such effects
need to be further determined, our analysis suggests that the same pathways are likely involved
in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and have potential for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition. In this regard it is
noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 replication demands extensive intracellular membranes (Snijder et
al., 2020) which would be impacted by changes to cholesterol biogenesis, as is the case for
Hepatitis C Virus, another positive sense RNA virus (Paul et al., 2013; Stoeck et al., 2018).
While we demonstrated here the efficacy for several promising repurposed drugs as potential
COVID-19 treatments in multiple cell-based assays, it remains to be determined whether these
drugs will show any benefit to patients. The next step will be to test these compounds in an
animal model before initiating clinical trials. Furthermore, with varying efficacy in different cell
culture models and tentative value as therapeutics, all six aforementioned drugs clearly inhibit
SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. Should animal models prove these drugs to be ineffective,
these data would still be of value as they can be used to study the biology of SARS-CoV-2 as it
pertains to cholesterol biosynthesis.

Methods
Cell Culture: Human adenocarcinomic alveolar basal epithelial (A549) cells (ATCC, CCL-185),
African green monkey kidney epithelial Vero-E6 cells (ATCC, CRL-1586) were maintained at
37°C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with
10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Corning). A549ACE2 heterogeneous cell population was
generated by transducing A549 cells with lentivirus without selection. All drug treatments were
administered to plated cells and cell cultures 1 hour prior to infection.
Viruses: SARS-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Isolate USA-WA1/2020 (NR-52281) was
deposited by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and obtained through BEI
Resources, NIAID, NIH. SARS-CoV-2 was propagated in Vero-E6 cells in DMEM supplemented
with 2% FBS, 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 4 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM Non-Essential Amino Acids, 1 mM
Sodium Pyruvate and 10 mM HEPES. Infectious titers of SARS-CoV-2 were determined by
plaque assay in Vero E6 cells in Minimum Essential Media supplemented with 4 mM Lglutamine, 0.2% BSA, 10 mM HEPES and 0.12% NaHCO3 and 0.7% agar. All work involving
live SARS-CoV-2 was performed in the CDC/USDA-approved BSL-3 facility of the Global Health
and Emerging Pathogens Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in accordance
with institutional biosafety requirements.
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis: RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using
SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher) with oligo d(T) primers. Quantitative realtime PCRs were performed using KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix Kit (Kapa Biosystems)
on a LightCycler 480 Instrument II (Roche). Primers specific for the leader sequence and

quantified by normalizing vRNA delta-Ct values to alpha-tubulin and calculating log(2)fold
reduction normalized to DMSO-treated and infected samples. Significance was determined
using an unpaired two-tailed student’s t-test.
Western blot analysis: Protein was extracted from cells using Radioimmunoprecipitation assay
(RIPA) lysis buffer containing 1X cOmplete Protease InhibitorCocktail (Roche) and 1X
Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma Aldrich) prior to removal from the BSL-3 facility. Samples

5000006) and run by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes and blocked in 5% milk in PBS. Proteins were detected using mouse monoclonal
anti-SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid [1C7C7] protein (a kind gift by Dr. T. Moran, Center for
Therapeutic Antibody Discovery at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai) and rabbit
monoclonal anti-vinculin (Abcam, ab129002). Primary antibodies were detected by IRDye 680
Goat anti-Mouse IgG secondary antibody (926-68070) and IRDye 800 Goat anti-Rabbit
secondary antibody (926-32211) (Li-Cor) and visualized using a Li-Cor Odyssey CLx imaging
system (Li-Cor).
Cell viability: A549 cells were treated with drugs resuspended in DMSO at a concentration of
10µM. 24h post treatment, cells were washed in 1 x PBS and cell viability was assessed using
CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). Luminescence read-out was
normalized to signal from vehicle treated cells and represented as percentage of viable cells
compared to vehicle. Values are an average of triplicate samples and error bars indicate
standard deviation.
RNA-Seq of viral infections and drug treatments: Approximately 1 × 106 A549 cells were
infected with SARS-CoV-2. Infections with IAV were performed at a multiplicity of infection of 5
for 9 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.3% BSA, 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 4 mM L-glutamine and 1
µg/ml TPCK-trypsin. Infections with SARS-CoV-2 were performed at an MOI of 0.2 for 24 h in
DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 4.5 g/L D-glucose, 4 mM L-glutamine, 10 mM NonEssential Amino Acids, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate and 10 mM HEPES. Total RNA from infected
and mock infected cells was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and Direct-zol RNA
Miniprep kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and treated with
DNase I. RNA-seq libraries of polyadenylated RNA were prepared using the TruSeq RNA
Library Prep Kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA-seq libraries for
total ribosomal RNA-depleted RNA were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA
Library Prep Gold (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA libraries were
sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq 500 platform.
Bioinformatics analyses: Raw reads were aligned to the human genome (hg19) using the
RNA-Seq Alignment App on Basespace (Illumina, CA). The top 2000 gene counts with the
highest variance were log transformed and Z-score normalized. PCA analysis was performed on
the normalized matrix. Differential expression analysis was performed with the Characteristic
Direction method on the normalized matrix or with limma on the original count matrix filtered
using the method described in (Chen et al., 2016). All differentially expressed genes were

submitted for analysis with L1000FWD and Enrichr. Jupyter notebooks from previously
published RNA-seq data were generated with BioJupies.
Consensus analysis was performed by counting gene overlap in the top 50 up or down
differentially expressed genes based on the consensus L1000FWD and RNA-seq signatures
generated from the A549-ACE2 cells. Consensus L1000FWD genes for the drugs were created
by enumerating all up and down signatures present in the L1000FWD database associated with
those drugs. First the instances of genes appearing in the up or down gene sets were counted,
and the cdf of the Z-scored counts was computed to quantify the probability of a given gene
being an essential member of signatures for a given drug. Finally, the down probabilities were
subtracted from the up probabilities and summed for all drugs resulting in genes ranked by their
probable essentiality across all drugs. The top 50 positive (mostly up regulated) and negative
(mostly down regulated) genes were taken to represent the consensus genes for these drugs.
The RNA-seq signatures from the A549-ACE2 cells were computed by differential expression
analysis with limma on the filtered count matrix. The top 50 up and down regulated genes were
taken as the signature.
To generate the figure that compares the L1000 differential expression signatures, we obtained
all the signatures for the drugs RS-504393, trifluoperazine, chlorpromazine, amlodipine,
berbamine, loperamide, and terfenadine from the L1000FWD processed data. Drugs are tested
in different cell lines and batches, resulting in 11, 60, 32, 21, 12, 26, and 21 signatures,
respectively. We then calculated a representative signature for each drug by averaging the
differential expression per gene across the replicates. We then calculated the representative
signature for all 4,941 unique drugs contained within the L1000FWD database. We calculated
the pairwise similarity between the representative signatures by Pearson correlation. The t-test
was applied to compare the pairwise correlation distribution between the 7 candidate drugs and
the distribution of all pairwise correlation scores.
iPSC-derived organoids: Undifferentiated human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) were
maintained in feeder-free conditions. Briefly, hPSCs were cultured on Matrigel-coated 6-well
plates in commercial StemFlex™ Medium (ThermoFisher). The medium was changed every
day, and cells were passaged every ∼4 days using ReLeSR™ (STEM Technologies). In all
normal hPSC cultures, 5 μM Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 was only
added into the culture media when passaging or thawing hPSCs. For pancreatic endocrine
organoid differentiation, we adapted previous published protocols (Yang et al., 2020).

Micro-neutralization assays: 293T producer cells were transfected to overexpress SARSCoV-2, VSV-G, or NiV glycoproteins. Approximately 8 hours post transfection, cells were
infected with the VSV∆G-rLuc reporter virus for 2 hours, then washed with DPBS. Two days
post infection, supernatants were collected and clarified by centrifugation at 1250 rpm for 5mins.
Upon collection, a small batch of VSV∆G-rLuc particles bearing the CoV2pp were then treated
with TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma) at room temperature for 15 minutes prior to inhibition with
soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI). Particles were aliquoted prior to storage in -80ºC to avoid
multiple freeze-thaws. To titer these pseudoviruses, 20,000 Vero-CCL81 cells were seeded in a
96 well plate 20-24hrs prior to infection. At 18-22 hours post infection, the infected cells were
washed with DPBS, lysed with a passive lysis buffer, and processed for detection of Renilla
luciferase. The Cytation3 (BioTek) was used to read luminescence.

computed from a signature created from SARS-CoV-2 uninfected vs. infected A549ACE2 cells
from GSE74235. Significance overlap is observed for the intersection between the consensus
up genes from the RNA-seq and L1000 drug only sets (22 genes, p-value<2.1e-46, Fisher exact
test), and between the consensus up genes from the RNA-seq, L1000 drug only sets, and the
top 50 down genes from the A549-ACE2 infected cells (5 genes, p-value<5.1e-101, empirical
sampling fitted to a Poisson distribution). These 5 genes are listed above their associated bar.
