SUMMARY. The rapid and escalating spread of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
poses an immediate public health emergency. The viral spike protein S binds ACE2
on host cells to initiate molecular events that release the viral genome
intracellularly. Soluble ACE2 inhibits entry of both SARS and SARS-2 coronaviruses
by acting as a decoy for S binding sites, and is a candidate for therapeutic,
prophylactic and diagnostic development. Using deep mutagenesis, variants of ACE2
are identified with increased binding to the receptor binding domain of S. Mutations
are found across the interface, in the N90-glycosylation motif, and at buried sites
where they are predicted to enhance local folding and presentation of the interaction
epitope. When single substitutions are combined, large increases in binding can be
achieved. The mutational landscape offers a blueprint for engineering high affinity
proteins and peptides that block receptor binding sites on S to meet this
unprecedented challenge.

In December, 2019, a novel zoonotic betacoronavirus closely related to bat coronaviruses
spilled over to humans, possibly at the Huanan Seafood Market in the Chinese city of
Wuhan (1, 2). The virus, called SARS-CoV-2 due to its similarities with the severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus responsible for a smaller outbreak nearly two
decades prior (3, 4), has since spread human-to-human rapidly across the world,
precipitating extraordinary containment measures from governments (5). These events
are unlike any experienced in generations. Symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) range from mild to dry cough, fever, pneumonia and death, and SARS-CoV-2 is
devastating among the elderly and other vulnerable groups (6, 7).

The S spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on
host cells (2, 8-13). S is a trimeric class I viral fusion protein that is proteolytically
processed into S1 and S2 subunits that remain noncovalently associated in a prefusion
state (8, 11, 14). Upon engagement of ACE2 by a receptor binding domain (RBD) in S1 (15),
conformational rearrangements occur that cause S1 shedding, cleavage of S2 by host
proteases, and exposure of a fusion peptide adjacent to the S2' proteolysis site (14, 16-18).
Favorable folding of S to a post-fusion conformation is coupled to host cell/virus
membrane fusion and cytosolic release of viral RNA. Atomic contacts with the RBD are
restricted to the protease domain of ACE2 (19, 20), and soluble ACE2 (sACE2) in which the
transmembrane domain is removed is sufficient for binding S and neutralizing infection
(12, 21-24). In principle, the virus has limited potential to escape sACE2-mediated
neutralization without simultaneously decreasing affinity for native ACE2 receptors,
thereby attenuating virulence. Furthermore, fusion of sACE2 to the Fc region of human

immunoglobulin can provide an avidity boost while recruiting immune effector functions
and increasing serum stability, an especially desirable quality if intended for prophylaxis
(23, 25), and sACE2 has proven safe in healthy human subjects (26) and patients with lung
disease (27). Recombinant sACE2 is being evaluated in a European phase II clinical trial for
COVID-19 managed by Apeiron Biologics, and peptide derivatives of ACE2 are also being
explored as cell entry inhibitors (28).

Since human ACE2 has not evolved to recognize SARS-CoV-2 S, it was hypothesized that
mutations may be found that increase affinity for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.
The coding sequence of full length ACE2 with an N-terminal c-myc epitope tag was
diversified to create a library containing all possible single amino acid substitutions at 117
sites spanning the entire interface with S and lining the substrate-binding cavity. S binding
is independent of ACE2 catalytic activity (23) and occurs on the outer surface of ACE2 (19,
20), whereas angiotensin substrates bind within a deep cleft that houses the active site
(29). Substitutions within the substrate-binding cleft of ACE2 therefore act as controls that
are anticipated to have minimal impact on S interactions, yet may be useful for engineering
out substrate affinity to enhance in vivo safety. However, it is important to note that
catalytically active protein may have desirable effects for replenishing lost ACE2 activity in
COVID-19 patients in respiratory distress (30, 31).

The ACE2 library was transiently expressed in human Expi293F cells under conditions that
typically yield no more than one coding variant per cell, providing a tight link between
genotype and phenotype (32, 33). Cells were then incubated with a subsaturating dilution
of medium containing the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 fused C-terminally to superfolder GFP
(sfGFP: (34)) (Fig. 1A). Levels of bound RBD-sfGFP correlate with surface expression levels
of myc-tagged ACE2 measured by dual color flow cytometry. Compared to cells expressing
wild type ACE2 (Fig. 1C), many variants in the ACE2 library fail to bind RBD, while there
appeared to be a smaller number of ACE2 variants with higher binding signals (Fig. 1D).
Cells expressing ACE2 variants with high or low binding to RBD were collected by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), referred to as "nCoV-S-High" and "nCoV-S-Low"
sorted populations, respectively. During FACS, fluorescence signal for bound RBD-sfGFP
continuously declined, requiring the collection gates to be regularly updated to 'chase' the
relevant populations. This is consistent with RBD dissociating over hours during the
experiment.

(A) Media from Expi293F cells secreting the SARS-CoV-2 RBD fused to sfGFP was collected
and incubated at different dilutions with Expi293F cells expressing myc-tagged ACE2. Bound
RBD-sfGFP was measured by flow cytometry. The dilutions of RBD-sfGFP-containing medium
used for FACS selections are indicated by arrows.
(B-C) Expi293F cells were transfected with wild type ACE2 plasmid diluted with a large excess
of carrier DNA. It has been previously shown that under these conditions, cells typically acquire
no more than one coding plasmid and most cells are negative. Cells were incubated with RBDsfGFP-containing medium and co-stained with fluorescent anti-myc to detect surface ACE2 by
flow cytometry. During analysis, the top 67% (magenta gate) were chosen from the ACE2positive population (purple gate) (B). Bound RBD was subsequently measured relative to
surface ACE2 expression (C).
(D) Expi293F cells were transfected with an ACE2 single site-saturation mutagenesis library and
analyzed as in B. During FACS, the top 15% of cells with bound RBD relative to ACE2
expression were collected (nCoV-S-High sort, green gate) and the bottom 20% were collected
separately (nCoV-S-Low sort, blue gate).

Transcripts in the sorted populations were deep sequenced, and frequencies of variants
were compared to the naive plasmid library to calculate the enrichment or depletion of all
2,340 coding mutations in the library (Fig. 2). This approach of tracking an in vitro
selection or evolution by deep sequencing is known as deep mutagenesis (35). Enrichment
ratios (Fig. 3A and 3B) and residue conservation scores (Fig. 3D and 3E) closely agree
between two independent sort experiments, giving confidence in the data. For the most
part, enrichment ratios (Fig. 3C) and conservation scores (Fig. 3F) in the nCoV-S-High sorts
are anticorrelated with the nCoV-S-Low sorts, with the exception of nonsense mutations
which were appropriately depleted from both gates. This indicates that most, but not all,
nonsynonymous mutations in ACE2 did not eliminate surface expression. The library is
biased towards solvent-exposed residues and has few substitutions of buried hydrophobics
that might have bigger effects on plasma membrane trafficking (33).

Mapping the experimental conservation scores from the nCoV-S-High sorts to the structure
of RBD-bound ACE2 (19) shows that residues buried in the interface tend to be conserved,
whereas residues at the interface periphery or in the substrate-binding cleft are
mutationally tolerant (Fig. 4A). The region of ACE2 surrounding the C-terminal end of the
ACE2 α1 helix and β3-β4 strands has a weak tolerance of polar residues, while amino acids
at the N-terminal end of α1 and the C-terminal end of α2 prefer hydrophobics (Fig. 4B),
likely in part to preserve hydrophobic packing between α1-α2. These discrete patches
contact the globular RBD fold and a long protruding loop of the RBD, respectively.

Two ACE2 residues, N90 and T92 that together form a consensus N-glycosylation motif, are
notable hot spots for enriched mutations (Fig. 2 and 4A). Indeed, all substitutions of N90
and T92, with the exception of T92S which maintains the N-glycan, are highly favorable for
RBD binding, and the N90-glycan is thus predicted to partially hinder S/ACE2 interaction.
This result may be dependent on the chemical nature of glycan moieties attached in
different cell types.

Mining the data identifies many ACE2 mutations that are enriched for RBD binding. For
instance, there are 122 mutations to 35 positions in the library that have log2 enrichment
ratios >1.5 in the nCoV-S-High sort. By comparing the mutational landscape with human
genetic diversity, it has been proposed that ACE2 polymorphisms are relevant to COVID-19
pathogenesis and transmission (36, 37), although this will require further validation. At
least a dozen ACE2 mutations at the structurally characterized interface enhance RBD
binding, and will be useful for engineering highly specific and tight protein or peptide
binders of SARS-CoV-2 S. The molecular basis for how some of these mutations enhance
RBD binding can be rationalized from the RBD-bound cryo-EM structure (Fig. 4C):
hydrophobic substitutions of ACE2-T27 increase hydrophobic packing with aromatic
residues of S, ACE2-D30E extends an acidic side chain to reach S-K417, and aromatic
substitutions of ACE2-K31 contribute to an interfacial cluster of aromatics. A search for
affinity-enhancing mutations in ACE2 using targeted mutagenesis recently identified D30E
(38), providing independent confirmation of the methods used here.

Attention was also drawn to mutations in the second shell and farther from the interface
that do not directly contact S but instead have putative structural roles. For example,
proline substitutions were enriched at five library positions (S19, L91, T92, T324 and
Q325) where they might entropically stabilize the first turns of helices. Proline was also
enriched at H34, where it may enforce the central bulge in α1. Multiple mutations were
also enriched at buried positions where they will change local packing (e.g. A25V, L29F,
W69V, F72Y and L351F). The selection of ACE2 variants for high binding signal therefore
not only reports on affinity, but also on presentation at the membrane of folded structure
recognized by SARS-CoV-2 S. Whether these mutations selectively stabilize a virusrecognized local structure in ACE2 versus the global protein fold is unclear.

Thirty single substitutions highly enriched in the nCoV-S-High sort were validated by
targeted mutagenesis (Fig. 5). Binding of RBD-sfGFP to full length ACE2 mutants increased
compared to wild type, yet improvements were small and most apparent on cells
expressing low ACE2 levels (Fig. 5A). Differences in ACE2 expression between the mutants
also correlated with total levels of bound RBD-sfGFP (Fig. 5C). To rapidly assess mutations
in a format more relevant to therapeutic and diagnostic development, the soluble ACE2
protease domain was fused to sfGFP. Expression levels of sACE2-sfGFP were qualitatively

evaluated by fluorescence of the transfected cultures (Fig. 6A), and binding of sACE2-sfGFP
to full length S expressed at the plasma membrane was measured by flow cytometry (Fig.
6B). A single substitution (T92Q) that eliminates the N90 glycan gave a small increase in
binding signal (Fig. 6B). Focusing on the most highly enriched substitutions in the selection
for S binding that were also spatially segregated to minimize negative epistasis (39),
combinations of mutations in sACE2 gave large increases in S binding (Table 1 and Fig. 6B).
While this assay only provides relative differences, the combinatorial mutants have
enhanced binding by at least an order of magnitude. Unexplored combinations of mutations
may have even greater effects.

Figure 5. Single amino acid substitutions in ACE2 predicted from the deep mutational
scan to increase RBD binding have small effects.
(A) Expi293F cells expressing full length ACE2 were stained with RBD-sfGFP-containing
medium and analyzed by flow cytometry. Data are compared between wild type ACE2 (black)
and a single mutant (L79T, red). Increased RBD binding is most discernable in cells expressing
low levels of ACE2 (blue gate). In this experiment, ACE2 has an extracellular N-terminal myc
tag upstream of residue S19 that is used to detect surface expression.
(B) RBD-sfGFP binding was measured for 30 single amino acid substitutions in ACE2. Data are
GFP mean fluorescence in the low expression gate (blue gate in panel A) with background
fluorescence subtracted.
(C) RBD-sfGFP binding measured for the total ACE2-positive population (green gate in panel A)
is shown in the upper graph, while the lower graph plots ACE2 expression measured by
detection of the extracellular myc tag. Total RBD-sfGFP binding correlates with total ACE2
expression, and differences in binding between the mutants are therefore most apparent only
after controlling for expression levels as in panel A.

A single variant, sACE2.v2, was chosen for purification and further characterization (Fig. 7).
This variant was selected because it was well expressed fused to sfGFP and maintains the
N90-glycan, and will therefore present a surface that more closely matches native sACE2 to
minimize immunogenicity. The yield of sACE2.v2 was lower than the wild type protein
when purified as an 8his-tagged protein (20% lower) or as an IgG1-Fc fusion (60% lower),
and by analytical size exclusion chromatography (SEC) a small fraction of sACE2.v2 was
found to aggregate after incubation at 37 °C for 40 h (Fig. 7D). Otherwise, sACE2.v2 was
indistinguishable from wild type by SEC (Fig. 7C).

In flow cytometry experiments using purified 8his-tagged sACE2, only sACE2.v2-8h was
found to bind strongly to full length S at the cell surface, suggestive that wild type sACE2
has a high off-rate that causes dissociation during sample washing (Fig. 8A and 9).
Differences between wild type and the variant were less pronounced in the context of an
IgG1-Fc fusion (Fig. 8A and 9), indicating that avidity masks gains in binding of the mutant,
again suggestive that there are off-rate differences between wild type and variant sACE2.
Soluble ACE2.v2-8h outcompetes wild type sACE2-IgG1 for binding to S-expressing cells,
yet wild type sACE2-8h does not outcompete sACE2-IgG1 even at 10-fold higher
concentrations (Fig. 8B). These results align with a study showing that while wild type
sACE2 is highly effective at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell lines and organoids,
extremely high concentrations are required (24). Cell experiments were supported by
biolayer interferometry (BLI), in which IgG1-Fc fused RBD was captured on a biosensor
surface and the association and dissociation kinetics of 8his-tagged sACE2 were
determined. The KD of wild type sACE2-8h for the RBD was 140 to 150 nM (Fig. 8C and
10F), slightly higher than the KD values reported by others that range from 1 to 50 nM (8,
10)(40). Variant sACE2.v2 had 65-fold tighter affinity for the RBD, almost entirely due to a
slower off-rate (Fig. 8D). Across all experiments, whether ACE2 is purified as a 8his-tagged
protein or used as a sfGFP-fusion in expression medium, and whether full-length S is
expressed on the plasma membrane or the isolated RBD is immobilized on a biosensor
surface, the characterized sACE2.v2 variant consistently shows one to two orders of
magnitude tighter binding. These experiments support the key discovery from deep
mutagenesis that mutations in human ACE2 exist that increase binding to S of SARS-CoV-2.

To address the decreased expression of sACE2.v2, it was hypothesized that the mutational
load is too high. Each of the four mutations in sACE2.v2 was reverted back to the wild type
identity (Table 1), and binding to full length S at the cell surface was found to remain tight
using rapid screening of sACE2-sfGFP-containing expression medium (Fig. 10A).
Expression was rescued to varying degrees (Fig. 10B), and one of the variants (sACE2.v2.4
with mutations T27Y, L79T and N330Y) was purified with higher yields than wild type
(20% and 80% higher for 8his and IgG1-Fc tagged proteins, respectively), although some
protein remained aggregated after storage at 37 °C for 60 h (Figure 10D and 10E). A
second reversion variant (sACE2.v2.2 with mutations T27Y, N330Y and A386L) has a more
hydrophobic surface and higher propensity to partially aggregate after storage at 37 °C,
and therefore the partial storage instability may be intrinsically linked to increased
hydrophobicity of the mutated ACE2 surface. By BLI, sACE2.v2.4 displayed tight nanomolar
binding to the RBD (Fig. 10G), demonstrating that high affinity can be achieved without
compromising protein expression and purification. Further sequence optimization focused
on whether to include the ACE2 neck domain for stable dimer formation is warranted.

While deep mutagenesis of viral proteins in replicating viruses has been extensively
pursued to understand escape mechanisms from drugs and antibodies, the work here
shows how deep mutagenesis can be directly applicable to anti-viral protein design when
the selection method is decoupled from virus replication and focused on host factors.

Plasmids. The mature polypeptide (a.a. 19-805) of human ACE2 (GenBank NM_021804.1)
was cloned in to the NheI-XhoI sites of pCEP4 (Invitrogen) with a N-terminal HA leader
(MKTIIALSYIFCLVFA), myc-tag, and linker (GSPGGA). Soluble ACE2 fused to superfolder
GFP (34) was constructed by genetically joining the protease domain (a.a. 1-615) of ACE2
to sfGFP (GenBank ASL68970) via a gly/ser-rich linker (GSGGSGSGG), and pasting between
the NheI-XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). Equivalent sACE2 constructs were cloned
with a GSG linker and 8 histidine tag, or a GS linker and the Fc region of IgG1 (a.a. D221K447). A synthetic human codon-optimized gene fragment (Integrated DNA Technologies)
for the RBD (a.a. 333-529) of SARS-CoV-2 S (GenBank YP_009724390.1) was N-terminally
fused to a HA leader and C-terminally fused to either superfolder GFP, the Fc region of IgG1
or a 8 histidine tag. Assembled DNA fragments were ligated in to the NheI-XhoI sites of
pcDNA3.1(+). Human codon-optimized full length S was subcloned from pUC57-2019nCoV-S(Human) (Molecular Cloud), both untagged (a.a. 1-1273) and with a N-terminal HA
leader (MKTIIALSYIFCLVFA), myc-tag and linker (GSPGGA) upstream of the mature
polypeptide (a.a. 16-1273).

Tissue Culture. Expi293F cells (ThermoFisher) were cultured in Expi293 Expression
Medium (ThermoFisher) at 125 rpm, 8 % CO2, 37 °C. For production of RBD-sfGFP, RBDIgG1, sACE2-8h and sACE2-IgG1, cells were prepared to 2 × 106 / ml. Per ml of culture, 500
ng of plasmid and 3 µg of polyethylenimine (MW 25,000; Polysciences) were mixed in 100
µl of OptiMEM (Gibco), incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature, and added to cells.
Transfection Enhancers (ThermoFisher) were added 18-23 h post-transfection, and cells
were cultured for 4-5 days. Cells were removed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 minutes
and medium was stored at -20 °C. After thawing and immediately prior to use, remaining
cell debris and precipitates were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 minutes.
Plasmids for expression of sACE2-sfGFP protein were transfected in to Expi293F cells using
Expifectamine (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer's directions, with
Transfection Enhancers added 22-1/2 h post-transfection, and medium supernatant
harvested after 60 h.

Deep mutagenesis. 117 residues within the protease domain of ACE2 were diversified by
overlap extension PCR (41) using primers with degenerate NNK codons. The plasmid
library was transfected in to Expi293F cells using Expifectamine under conditions
previously shown to typically give no more than a single coding variant per cell (32, 33); 1
ng coding plasmid was diluted with 1,500 ng pCEP4-ΔCMV carrier plasmid per ml of cell
culture at 2 × 106 / ml, and the medium was replaced 2 h post-transfection. The cells were
collected after 24 h, washed with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 0.2 % bovine serum
albumin (PBS-BSA), and incubated for 30 minutes on ice with a 1/20 (replicate 1) or 1/40
(replicate 2) dilution of medium containing RBD-sfGFP into PBS-BSA. Cells were co-stained

with anti-myc Alexa 647 (clone 9B11, 1/250 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology). Cells
were washed twice with PBS-BSA, and sorted on a BD FACS Aria II at the Roy J. Carver
Biotechnology Center. The main cell population was gated by forward/side scattering to
remove debris and doublets, and DAPI was added to the sample to exclude dead cells. Of
the myc-positive (Alexa 647) population, the top 67% were gated (Fig. 1B). Of these, the 15
% of cells with the highest and 20% of cells with the lowest GFP fluorescence were
collected (Fig. 1D) in tubes coated overnight with fetal bovine serum and containing
Expi293 Expression Medium. Total RNA was extracted from the collected cells using a
GeneJET RNA purification kit (Thermo Scientific), and cDNA was reverse transcribed with
high fidelity Accuscript (Agilent) primed with gene-specific oligonucleotides. Diversified
regions of ACE2 were PCR amplified as 5 fragments. Flanking sequences on the primers
added adapters to the ends of the products for annealing to Illumina sequencing primers,
unique barcoding, and for binding the flow cell. Amplicons were sequenced on an Illumina
NovaSeq 6000 using a 2×250 nt paired end protocol. Data were analyzed using Enrich (42),
and commands are provided in the GEO deposit. Briefly, the frequencies of ACE2 variants in
the transcripts of the sorted populations were compared to their frequencies in the naive
plasmid library to calculate a log2 enrichment ratio and then normalized by the same
calculation for wild type. Wild type sequences were neither substantially enriched or
depleted, and had log2 enrichment ratios of -0.2 to +0.2.

Flow Cytometry Analysis of ACE2-S Binding. Expi293F cells were transfected with
pcDNA3-myc-ACE2, pcDNA3-myc-S or pcDNA3-S plasmids (500 ng DNA per ml of culture
at 2 × 106 / ml) using Expifectamine (ThermoFisher). Cells were analyzed by flow
cytometry 24 h post-transfection. To analyze binding of RBD-sfGFP to full length mycACE2, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS-BSA, and incubated for 30 minutes on ice with a
1/30 dilution of medium containing RBD-sfGFP and a 1/240 dilution of anti-myc Alexa 647
(clone 9B11, Cell Signaling Technology). Cells were washed twice with PBS-BSA and
analyzed on a BD LSR II. To analyze binding of sACE2-sfGFP to full length myc-S, cells were
washed with PBS-BSA, and incubated for 30 minutes on ice with a serial dilution of medium
containing sACE2-sfGFP and a 1/240 dilution of anti-myc Alexa 647 (clone 9B11, Cell
Signaling Technology). Cells were washed twice with PBS-BSA and analyzed on a BD
Accuri C6, with the entire Alexa 647-positive population gated for analysis. To measure
binding of sACE2-IgG1 or sACE2-8h, myc-S or S transfected cells were washed with PBSBSA and incubated for 30 minutes with the indicated concentrations of purified sACE2 in
PBS-BSA. Cells were washed twice, incubated with secondary antibody (1/100 dilution of
chicken anti-HIS-FITC polyclonal from Immunology Consultants Laboratory; or 1/250 antihuman IgG-APC clone HP6017 from BioLegend) for 30 minutes on ice, washed twice again,
and fluorescence of the total population after gating by FSC-SSC to exclude debris was
measured on a BD Accuri C6. Data were processed with FCS Express (De Novo Software)
or BD Accuri C6 Software.
