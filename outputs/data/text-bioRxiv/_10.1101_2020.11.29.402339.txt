Abstract
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to infect
people globally. The increased COVID-19 cases and no licensed vaccines highlight the need to
develop safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multiple vaccines candidates
are under pre-clinical or clinical trails with different strengths and weaknesses. Here we developed
a pilot scale production of a recombinant subunit vaccine (RBD-Fc Vacc) with the Receptor Binding
Domain of SARS-CoV-2 S protein fused with the Fc domain of human IgG1. RBD-Fc Vacc induced
SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies in non-human primates and human ACE2 transgenic
mice. The antibodies induced in macaca fascicularis neutralized three divergent SARS-CoV2 strains,
suggesting a broader neutralizing ability. Three times immunizations protected Macaca fascicularis
(20ug or 40ug per dose) and mice (10ug or 20ug per dose) from SARS-CoV-2 infection respectively.
These data support clinical development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for humans. RBD-Fc Vacc is
currently being assessed in randomized controlled phase 1/II human clinical trails.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has infected more
than 60 million individuals and killed more than 1.4 million people globally1. Because of the high
prevalence, longer incubation, no preexisting immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in human and even no
effective treatment or drugs currently available, it is urgent to develop safe and efficient vaccines to
control and prevent the further dissemination of SARS-CoV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 showed similar but distinct genome composition of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV,
another two coronaviruses in the genus Beta coronavirus with zoonotic origin. So, by the knowledge
from SARS and MERS vaccines development path, several vaccine candidates, such as DNA
vaccines, RNA vaccines, viral vector vaccines, recombinant subunit protein vaccines, inactivated
virus vaccines are all developed 2,3 and at least three inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are in phase
III clinical trials4. Compared with other vaccines, recombinant subunit protein vaccine shows many
advantages such as safety, higher cost efficiency and easy to be handled3. The main concern about
the recombinant protein vaccine is that whether it can induce enough neutralizing antibodies and
provide protection. Fortunately, recombinant subunit vaccine targeting SARS-CoV-2 RBD induced
higher neutralizing antibodies without evident antibody dependent enhancement effects (ADE)

and may protect animals from SARS-CoV-2 attack 6,7.
SARS-CoV-2, homologous to SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus, also contains four structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M),
and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Among them, S protein plays the most important role in viral
attachment, fusion and entry, and induces neutralizing antibodies with virus infection, so serves as
a target for development of vaccines. The immunogenicity of SRAS-CoV-2 RBD, lies in S1 subunit
by binding to the receptor ACE2 and is crucial in mediating viral entry into host cells, has been
studied to induce neutralizing antibodies, which has been verified in samples from patients
recovered from COVID-198. These data indicate that RBD-based subunit proteins vaccine is a
competitive candidate.
The Fc fusion protein is recently used as an important backbone for drug development, owing
to its advantages including an expedient for rapid purification, longer half-life, increasing
immunogenicity of target antigens and eliciting neutralizing antibody response9 .In addition, Fc

promote the correct folding of fusion protein and to enhance binding to antigen-presenting cells
(APCs) and cell lines expressing Fc receptors (FcR)10,11 . For example, Enbrel, TNF Receptor-Fc
fusion protein used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis or other human diseases, is a therapeutic
biological drug without any known side-effect 12. We have previously developed Fc-fused protein
vaccines against MERS, SARS-CoV and H5N1 influenza, and found that Fc fused protein is more
immunogenic than those lacking fused Fc13-15.
In this study, we designed a similar recombinant subunit vaccine (RBD-Fc Vacc) with the
Receptor Binding Domain of SARS-CoV-2 S protein fused the Fc domain of human IgG1. The
RBD-Fc Vacc showed immunogenicity and protective efficacy in non-human primate and human
ACE2 transgenic (hACE2 Tg) mice with broader neutralizing ability against divergent SARS-CoV2 virus strains. This novel COVID-19 subunit vaccine is currently being evaluated in phase I/II
clinical trials. And for our best knowledge, this is the first Fc fusion protein-based vaccine tested in
clinical trials.

Results
Construction and antigenicity of RBD-Fc Vacc
Here a dimer-based RBD-Fc Vacc against SARS-CoV-2 was developed by fusing RBD (aa331-524)
with human IgG1 Fc. The predicted dimer structure is shown in Fig 1a (left panel) by protein
structure prediction server version 3.016: Two RBD domains are fused through Fc fragment to form
the Y-shaped structure. The RBD-Fc fusion protein was expressed in mammalian CHO cells and the
antigenicity and the dimer conformation were identified by western blot analysis using anti-serum
from COVID-19 recovered patients and commercial antibody respectively. (Fig.1a right panel). The
expressed protein is about 120 kDa under non-reduced condition and 60 kDa after reduced. The
calculated molecular weight of RBD-Fc protein is about 95.9 kDa while the purified recombinant
protein appears to be 120kDa on the western blot owning to protein glycosylation. Three Nglycosylation sites on asparagine, one O-glycosylation on serine and one O-glycosylation on
threonine were identified using mass spectrum (Fig.1b up panel). These identified glycosylation
sites were further mapped on the complex structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Fc bound to ACE2
predicted by ZDOCK server17. The glycosylation sites were located on the RBD core subdomain

and were found to be distant from the area bound to ACE2 (Fig.1b down panel), indicating that the
decorated glycopeptides may not interfere with receptor recognition.
The binding of RBD-Fc protein with ACE2 was then confirmed via surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) Biacore and potent interactions were observed in concordance with a previous study7. Results
from the SPR assay demonstrated that RBD-Fc protein bound to receptor hACE2 with much higher
avidity compared with RBD-His monomer (74.13nM vs. 8.26nM), indicating the better
conformation of our RBD-Fc protein (Fig.1c). The immunogenicities of RBD-Fc or RBD-His
protein were tested in BALB/c mice after two immunizations using aluminum as the adjuvant.
Compare to those from RBD-His vaccinated mice, serum from RBD-Fc vaccinated mice showed
significantly higher RBD specific IgG antibody titers (with median peak of 1/40765 vs 1/7845) and
live virus neutralizing antibody titers (with median peak of 1/61.8 vs. 1/24.4) (Fig.1d&e). These
data suggested that RBD-Fc fusion protein is more antigenic than monomer RBD protein.
The immunogenicity of RBD-Fc Vacc in Macaca fascicularis and hACE2-Tg mice
We evaluated the immunogenicity of RBD-Fc Vacc in 3-year-old Macaca fascicularis, a non-human
primate model that was susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection18-20. Two groups of Macaca
fascicularis (n=5/each group) were immunized with 20ug or 40ug of RBD-Fc Vacc via
intramuscular administration at 0 days(prime),14 days (1st boost) and 28 days (2nd boost) and the
equal number of macaques (n=5) received PBS injection as the sham control. No inflammation or
other adverse effects were observed during the observation period. Serum were collected at each
time point as shown in Fig.2a to examine RBD specific antibodies as well as neutralizing antibodies
using ELISA or neutralization assay. High level of RBD- specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) were
induced quickly in the serum of RBD-Fc Vacc immunized Macaca fascicularis up to a median peak
of 1/17399 in 20ug group and of 1/41900 in 40ug group at day 28 (two weeks post 1st boost) (Fig.2b).
Although there is a moderate increase for RBD- specific IgG titers in serum collected at day 42
compare to those at day 28 (Fig.2b), there is a much higher NT50 in sera from three dose-RBDFc Vacc-immunized macaca fascicularis (day 42, boost twice) compare to those from two doseRBD-Fc Vacc-immunized animals (d28, boost once) (Fig.2c), which indicated that three dose of
immunization may induce a much better protective response. The variability in immunogenicity in
this study facilitated an analysis of correlations of different examining methods. NAb titers

measured by live virus neutralization assay correlated with RBD specific IgG titers (Fig.2d).
Because of the novel epidemic SARS-CoV-2 strains with specific mutations was recorded 20,21, we
further tested whether Macaca fascicularis sera post RBD-Fc vaccination could cross neutralize
different epidemic strains of SARS-CoV-2. Here three epidemic strains BJ08, BJ05 and BJ01, which
shared the same RBD sequence as our RBD-Fc vaccine22, were used to test the cross neutralization
effects. All the sera from RBD-Fc Vacc immunized Macaca fascicularis showed similar neutralizing
capability against three SARS-CoV-2 epidemic strains, and there was no significant difference in
NT50 titers (Fig.2e). In addition, the NT50 in sera from non-human primates receiving RBD-Fc
Vacc immunization was comparable to those from 23 COVID-19 convalescent patients’ serum.
(Fig.S1). Our results demonstrated that three immunization of RBD-Fc Vacc have induced high
levels of antibodies with broad neutralizing capabilities against SARS-CoV-2 in non-human
primates.
The immunogenicity of RBD-Fc Vacc was also confirmed in hACE2 Tg (n=8). The
immunizing schedule in mice was in accordance with Macaca fascicularis. RBD-specific
immunoglobulin G (IgG) and the neutralizing antibodies developed quickly in the serum of
vaccinated hACE2-Tg mice. And no significant difference was found between 10ug and 20ug RBDFc Vacc induced humoral immune response (Fig. S2).
To compare the cellular immune response, IFN-g ELISPOT assay and flow cytometry (d42)
were performed in Macaca fascicularis at 2 weeks post 2nd boost. There are comparable S1 or RBD
specific IFN-g response among splenocytes from non-vaccinated or from RBD-Fc Vacc vaccinated
macaca fascicularis (Fig. S3a) ,and the percentages of S1-specific IL-4+CD4+ T cells, IL-4+CD8+ T
cells; TNF-a+CD4+T cells, TNF-a+CD8+ T cells were at the same level (Fig. S3b), suggesting that
RBD-Fc Vacc mainly induces humoral immune response in vaccinated animals.
Protective efficiency against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in Macaca fascicularis and in hACE2-Tg
mice
We next evaluated whether RBD-Fc Vacc induces protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in
Macaca fascicularis. Four weeks after the third injection of 40ug RBD-Fc Vacc (d56), macaques
were challenged with 106 TCID50/mL SARS-CoV-2 as follows: 2 mL inoculation by the
intratracheal route, 1 mL by the intranasal route and 0.2 mL by the intraocular route. The substantial

fraction of viral RNA which represent input challenge virus in Nasal, throat and anal swabs were
examined at different times following challenge by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR
(qRT-PCR). Peak viral loads occurred variably following challenge. All control Macaca fascicularis
showed excessive copies of viral genomic RNA in the nasal, throat, anal and lung by day 2-6 post
inoculation (Fig.3a, b and Table S1) and severer interstitial pneumonia (Fig.3c). By contrast, all
vaccinated Macaca fascicularis were largely protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection with much
lower or absence of viral RNA copies and very mild histopathological changes in a few lobes of
lung. These data demonstrated that RBD-Fc Vacc induced potent immune response and efficiency
protected Macaca fascicularis from SARS-CoV-2 attack.
The protective efficiency of RBD-Fc Vacc against SARS-CoV-2 was also confirmed in
hACE2-Tg mice. Four weeks after the second boost immunization, mice were challenged
intranasally with 1.8 x 107 PFU/ml SARS-CoV-2. Five days following challenge, viral RNA levels
in lung were assessed by RT-PCR. RBD-Fc Vacc immunization in hACE2-Tg mice lead to a median
reduction of 2.10 Log10RNA copies/g and 2.13 in 10ug and 20ug group respectively (Fig.S4a). In
addition, all vaccinated animals were largely protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection with very
mild histopathological changes in the vaccinated animals, while moderate interstitial pneumonia in
sham group. (Fig.S4b).
Immune correlates of vaccine-induced protection
The variability in protective efficiency in this study facilitated an analysis of immune correlations
of protection. The live virus neutralization antibody titers at day49 inversely correlated with viral
RNA in lung of hACE2-Tg mice (Fig. 4a). In addition, the pseudovirus neutralization antibody
titers and the IgG titers at day 49 also indicated inversely correlation with viral RNA in lung of
hACE2-Tg mice (Fig. 4b&c). The vaccine induced immune response and protection also showed
some inverse correlation in Macaca fascicularis, however, due to the limitation of sample
numbers，the data cannot be statistically analyzed. These data demonstrated that serum IgG titers
and neutralization antibody titers elicited by RBD-Fc may be immune correlates of protection
against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The data also suggested that these parameters would be simple
and useful benchmark for clinical development of SRAS-CoV-2 vaccine.

Discussion:
The serious pandemic of current COVID-19 and the increasing numbers of death worldwide
necessitate the urgent development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The safety and efficiency are
essential for vaccine development at both stages of preclinical studies and clinical trials. In this
study, we generated a new recombinant vaccine by fusioning SARS-CoV-2 RBD with the Fc
domain of human IgG1 and assessed the protective efficacy against SARS CoV-2 challenge in nonhuman primates (macaca fascicularis) and hACE2-Tg mice respectively. Compared to the excessive
copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and severe lung damage in non-immunized sham groups, all
vaccinated macaca fascicularis were largely protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection with absence
or much lower of viral RNA copies and non- or very mild histopathological changes in a few lobes
of lung. It is also encouraging that our candidate RBD-Fc vaccine candidate induce effective
neutralizing activity in hACE2-Tg mice. Most importantly, serum from vaccinated macaca
fascicularis can neutralize different SARS-CoV-2 strains, demonstrating the wide spectrum of
neutralizing activity induced by RBD-Fc Vacc.
By the knowledge and vaccine platform from SARS and MERS, several vaccines have been
developed rapidly within a very short time. Inactivated vaccine is a traditional vaccine platform with
rapid development and conceptual safety, but demands more strict and precise process in
manufacturing which may determine a disease outbreak3. The new-generation vaccines, including
vector-based vaccines and recombinant protein vaccines, are a relatively safety profile because of
the selection of a specific antigen or antigens instead of the whole pathogen23. In addition to the
concerns that viral genome may integrate into host genome3, scaling-up of viral production capacity
is also a bottleneck of viral vector manufacturing24. Therefore, the current challenges of virus vectorbased vaccines still lie in a good balance between high recovery yield and impurity clearance and
the reduction of cost25 . Other vector based vaccine including DNA and mRNA vaccines are facing
challenges such as integration of foreign DNA into the host genome may cause abnormalities in the
cell3 and maintaining of vaccines in a harsh cold chain26,27. Recombinant protein vaccine expressed
in CHO system can maintain the right glycosylation and is an economic way to make enough
vaccines for a large-scale population. Especially recombinant subunit protein vaccine is the most
safety way as it does not have any live component of the viral particle3.

The most effective way to identify and deploy efficacious SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with
acceptable safety profiles is through carefully designed. SARS-CoV-2 virus is homologous to
SARS-CoV and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, which have been studied for
years. Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS, S protein of SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as a key
component triggering protective immunity. Previous studies in SARS-CoV vaccine development,
liver damage was observed in the animal model when the full length S protein was used as the
vaccine antigen28. Therefore, using S protein fragment, such as the receptor-binding domain (RBD),
as vaccine antigen might be a safer choice for COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Sequencing data have
showed that RBD is highly conserved among ten pandemic SARS-CoV-2 strains worldwide. Our
data showed that serum from RBD-Fc Vacc immunized Macaca fascicularis neutralized three
representative SARS-CoC-2 strains in microneutralization assay (Fig.3d). RBD-Fc-Vacc-elicited
serum IgG titers and NAb titers also correlates negatively with the virus copies of immunized
hACE2-Tg mice, demonstrating IgG and NAb titers as an immune correlate of protection. These
data suggested that RBD is an excellent target for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
The antibody mediated enhancement effects (ADE) is the most important safety concerns in
the development of vaccines. A recent report also showed that nonhuman primates infected with
SARS-CoV-2 are protected from reinfection with the virus29, which indicated that virus infection
induced a protective immune response. Reports showed that non-neutralizing antibodies is likely to
promote more efficient ADE than neutralizing antibodies30. It has been noted that non-neutralizing
coronavirus antibodies may cause ADE in feline infectious peritonitis. Such efforts have prompted
investigators to focus on the RBD as a lead vaccine candidate while remove potential ADEpromoting S protein epitopes outside the RBD13,31. Indeed, a recent data showed that RBD of SARSCoV-2 raised potently neutralizing antisera in immunized rats and these sera without ADE5. Our
reports showed that RBD-Fc Vacc immunized macaca fascicularis and mice were protected from
SARS-CoV-2 attack without evident side effects, which suggested that RBD is a safe and efficient
target for vaccine use.
Fusion proteins based on immunoglobulin Fc domain have received considerable attention
over the past two decades because of its capability to promote protein expression, purification, and
improve the immunogenicity of the fused proteins. Many therapeutic biological drugs based on Fc

protein fragment had been used for treatment of human diseases32. The application of Fc-fusion
protein as vaccine delivery platform was first reported in 1989 in which gp120-Fc was used as a
potential candidate for AIDS therapy33. Although there is no FDA approved Fc-fusion vaccine in
clinic, the explosion of vaccine development fused with Fc is active and ongoing. A number of
studies have been initiated on the development of vaccines against Ebola34, HIV35, influenza36,
SARS-CoV13, tuberculosis37 as well as RSV38, HNV39. Currently, although other options, such as
IgG3, IgA, and IgM are being explored, all commercial therapeutics use the Fc domain from human
IgG140. In addition, the ability of Fc to improve immune response has been confirmed in the studies
of vaccine designation fused with RBD of H5N1, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV13,14,41. Here, we
found that Fc fragment enhances the immunogenicity of RBD as RBD-Fc induced much higher titer
of S1 protein specific IgG antibodies and neutralization antibodies than RBD-His (Fig.1d&e), which
further demonstrated that Fc-fusion protein is a promising vaccine delivery platform.
In summary, our data demonstrated that RBD-Fc Vacc, with adjuvant of aluminum, induced a
robust humoral immune response and protected non-human primate and hACE2 Tg mice from
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, our data demonstrate the immune correlates of protection and
protective efficacy and support the immunogenicity of the RBD-Fc Vacc candidate in clinical use.
For the best of our knowledge, this is the first Fc fusion protein-based vaccine tested in clinical trials.
Further research will need to address the important questions of the durability of protective
immunity and the optimal vaccine strategy for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for humans.

The coding sequence for RBD-Fc region, which fused residues 331-524 from the spike protein of
the SARS-CoV-2 and human IgG1-Fc together, were synthesized by Beijing JOINN Bilogic
co.Ltd (Beijing, China) and then conducted into the GS expression vector ZY-CDMO. For protein
expression, the plasmid was first transfected into CHO-K1 cells and then stable clones were
isolated by the limiting dilution method in the presence of 50 μM of Methionine Sulfoximine
(MSX). The cell culture supernatants were collected and analyzed by western blot analysis using a
commercial antibody (Sino Biological Inc. Beijing, China) against SARS-CoV-2 RBD.
Mass spectroscopy (MS) analysis to identify glycosylation sites
The recombinant RBD-Fc protein was purified using affinity chromatography and anion exchange
chromatography. The purified RBD-Fc protein was then reduced by incubation with 10 mM Tris
(2-carboxymethyl) phosphine for 20 min at 45℃ in denaturation buffer (6 M guanidine
hydrochloride, 20 mM Tris, 0.1 mM Na2-EDTA, pH 7.50). After cooling to room temperature,
iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 60 mM and reaction was allowed to occur in
the dark for 15 min. The protein was digested with Endoproteinase Lys-C (1:20 w/w) at 37℃
overnight after buffer be replaced with the digestion buffer(20 mM Tris, pH 7.50）. The digestion
was stopped by formic acid solution and stored at 2~8℃ until injection into the column.
The digested Peptide mixture was then separated on an Advance Bio Peptide Mapping column
(2.1×150mm, 2.7μm) with flow rate of 0.2 mL/min and 75-min gradient (2–45% B) at 55℃. The
mobile phase A was 0.1% formic acid in water, while mobile phase B contained 0.1% formic acid
in acetonitrile. Liquid Chromatography (LC)-eluted peptides were detected by MS with an
alternating low collision energy (4 V) and elevated collision energy (ramping from 25 to 40 V)
ESI+ acquisition mode to obtain the precursor ions (MS) and their fragmentation data (MSE),
respectively. A capillary voltage of 3.0 kV, source temperature of 120℃, cone voltage of 40 V,
cone gas flow of 50 L/h were maintained during the analyses. The collected LC-MS data were
processed by UNIFI software. Glycan structures were set as variable modifications. The mass
tolerance for both precursors and fragments were set to less than 10 ppm.
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis
SPR-based measurements were performed by Biacore T200 (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden), as
described previously 16. Human ACE2-Avidin was captured to ~100RU on Sensor Chip Super

Streptavidin. For kinetic analysis, RBD-Fc or RBD-his (Sino Biological Inc, Beijing, China)
protein was run across the chip in a 2-fold dilution series (125, 62.5, 31.3, 15.6, 7.8nM), with
another channel set as control. Each sample bound across the antigen surface was dissociated by
HBS-EP (GE Healthcare) + running buffer for 300 s at a flow rate of 30 μL/min. Regeneration of
the sensor chips was performed for 60 s using regeneration buffer (10mM Glycine-HCl pH 2.1).
The association and dissociation rate constants ka and kd were monitored respectively and
the avidity value KD was determined.

with 40 μL of BetaCoV(BJ05). All mice or Macaca fascicularis were observed daily. On day 5 post
infection (for mice), or on day 7 post infection (for Macaca fascicularis), eight mice in each group
and four Macaca fascicularis in each group were sacrificed, and their lungs were removed for
detection of viral load or were embedded for pathological analysis as described below.
ELISA.
ELISA was performed to detect SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S1-specific IgG antibodies in the
immunized mouse or Macaca fascicularis sera. Briefly, ELISA plates were precoated with SARSCoV-2 S1 or RBD protein (2.0μg/ml) overnight at 4℃ and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 2 h at
37℃. Serially diluted sera were added to the plates and incubated for 45 min at 37℃. After four
washes, the bound antibodies were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated anti-mouse IgG or anti-Macaca fascicularis IgG antibody (1:5,000, Thermo Fisher
Scientific) for 30 min at 37℃. The reaction was visualized by addition of substrate 3,3’,5,5’Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and stopped by H2SO4 (1N). The absorbance
at 450 nm was measured by a microtiter plate reader (Tecan, San Jose, CA).
SARS-CoV-2 Pseudovirus based neutralization assay.
The SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus based neutralization assay was performed as described previously42.
In brief, mice or Macaca fascicularis sera at 3-fold serial dilutions were incubated with 650 TCID50
of the pseudovirus for 1 hour at 37 °C, and then 20000 Huh7 cells were added into each well. DMEM
was used as negative control. After 24h incubation in 37℃, the supernatant was then removed and
luciferase substrate was added to each well followed by incubation for 2 minutes in darkness at
room temperature. Luciferase activity was then measured using GloMax® 96 Microplate
Luminometer (Promega). The 50% neutralization titer (NT50) was defined as the serum dilution at
which the relative light units (RLUs) were reduced by 50% compared with the virus control wells.
SARS-CoV-2 wild type virus neutralization assay.
A micro-neutralization assay was carried out to detect neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2
infection. Briefly, mouse or Macaca fascicularis sera at 2-fold serial dilutions were incubated with
SARS-CoV-2 (BetaCoV/BJ01); 100 TCID50) for 1 h at 37℃ and added to Vero cells. The cells
were observed daily for the presence or absence of virus-induced Cytopathic Effect (CPE）and
recorded at 72 h. Neutralizing antibody titers were determined as the highest dilution of sera that

can completely inhibit virus-induced CPE in at least 50% of the wells (NT50).
Measurement of viral RNA.
Tissue homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 6 min, and the supernatants
were collected. Viral RNA (vRNA) was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. vRNA quantification in each sample was performed by
quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) targeting the S gene of SARS-CoV-2. RT-qPCR
was performed using One Step PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (Takara, Japan) with the following primers
and

probes:

CoV-F3

(5‘-TCCTGGTGATTCTTCTTCAGGT-3’);

CoV-R3

(5‘-

TCTGAGAGAGGGTCAAGTGC-3’); and CoV-P3 (5‘-FAM-AGCTGCAGCACCAGCTGTCCABHQ1 -3’)
IFN-g ELISpot.
PBMCs were collected from Macaca fascicularis and suspended in RPMI1640 media supplemented
with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin and processed into single cell suspensions. ELISpot
assays were performed using the Macaca fascicularis IFN-g ELISpot PLUS plates (MABTECH).
96-well ELISpot plates precoated with capture antibody were blocked with RPMI1640 medium
overnight at 4 °C. 8 x 105 PBMCs were plated into each well and stimulated for 48 h-72 h with S1
or RBD-his protein. The spots were developed based on manufacturer’s instructions. Medium and
anti-CD3, anti-CD28 antibody were used for negative and positive controls, respectively. Spots were
scanned and quantified by ImmunoSpot CTL reader. Spot-forming unit (SFU) per million cells was
calculated by subtracting the negative control wells.
Intracellular cytokine staining.
Intracellular production of the cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), and
interleukin-4 (IL-4) was examined by flow cytometry. Briefly, PBMCs were harvested from Macaca
fascicularis and stimulated with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein for 6 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Then cells
were first stained with Percp conjugated anti-monkey CD4 (RM4-5, BD, 561115), Percp conjugated
anti-monkey CD8a (RPA-T8, BD, 560662), at 4°C for 25 min. PE conjugated anti-monkey IL-4
(8D4-8, BD, 551774), and PE conjugated anti-monkey TNF-a (MAb11, BD, 557068) using the
Cytofix/Cytoperm fixation/permeabilization solution kit (BD) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Cell events were acquired using an FACS CANTO (BD), followed by FlowJo software

(FlowJo LLC, Ashland, OR) analysis.
Histopathological analysis.
Five- or seven-days post virus challenge, animals were sacrificed and lung tissues were obtained,
and paraffin-embedded in accordance with the standard procedure. Sections at 5 μm thickness were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and examined by light microscopy. Lung tissue lesions
were assessed according to the extent of denatured and collapsed bronchiole epithelial cells,
degeneration of alveoli pneumocytes, infiltration of inflammatory cells, edema, hemorrhage,
exudation and expansion of parenchymal wall. The semi-quantitative assessment was scored for the
severity of lung damage according to the above criteria (0, normal; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, marked).
The cumulative scores of the severity provided the total score per animal, and the average of six to
eight animals from each group was taken as the total score for that group.
Statistical analysis.
Statistical analyses were carried out using Prism software (GraphPad). All data are presented as
means ± standard error of the means (SEM). Statistical significance among
different groups were calculated using the Student’s t test, Fisher’s Exact test, two-sided Spearman
rank-correlation test，or Mann-Whitney test. *, **, and *** indicate P < 0.05, P < 0.01, and P <
0.001, respectively.

Fig.S4. Protective efficacy of RBD-Fc Vacc in hACE2-Tg mice. hACE2-Tg Mice were
immunized three times as described in the materials and methods (n=8). a) Viral loads in lung
tissue from the inoculated mice at day 5 post infection were measured. All data presented as mean
+ SEM from four independent experiments. The dashed lines indicate the detection limit of the
assay. b) Histopathological examinations in lungs from all the inoculated mice at day 5 post
injection. Semi-quantitative analysis of histopathological changes of lung tissues. Data are
presented as means ± SEM (n=6).
