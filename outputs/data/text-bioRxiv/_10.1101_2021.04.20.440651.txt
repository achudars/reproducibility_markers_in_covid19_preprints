Abstract

39

SARS-CoV-2 enters the body at mucosal surfaces, such as the nose and lungs. These

40

events involve a small number of virions at these mucosal barriers and are therefore a

41

strategic point to stop a COVID-19 infection before it starts. Despite this, most vaccines

42

against COVID-19 are being injected into the muscle where they will not generate the

43

highest levels of mucosal protection. The vaccines that are approved for use in humans

44

are all replication-defective (RD) mRNA, DNA, or adenovirus (Ad) vaccines that do not

45

amplify antigen transgenes. We developed single cycle adenovirus (SC-Ad) vectors that

46

replicate antigen genes up to 10,000-fold in human cells, but that are disabled from

47

producing infectious Ad particles. We show here that SC-Ad expressing the full-length

48

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein produces 100-fold more spike protein than a matched RD-Ad-

49

Spike vector. When Ad-permissive hamsters were immunized with these vaccines by

50

intranasal (IN) or intramuscular (IM) routes, SC-Ad produced significantly stronger

51

antibody responses as compared to RD-Ad against the spike protein that rose over 14

52

weeks after one immunization. Single IN or IM immunizations generated significant

53

antibody responses in serum and in bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs). IN priming, but not

54

IM priming, generated HLA-restricted CD8 T cell responses in BALs. SC-Ad-Spike

55

generated antibodies that retain binding to spike receptor binding domains (RBDs) with

56

mutations from new viral variants. These data suggest empowering the genomes of gene-

57

based vaccines with the ability to amplify antigen genes can increase potency. This may

58

be particularly advantageous when applying mucosal vaccines to combat mucosal

59

pathogens like SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

67

In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases were identified in Wuhan, China, which

68

were later found to be caused by a novel coronavirus: severe acute respiratory syndrome

69

coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Li & al., 2020) (Gralinski & Menachery, 2020). As of April

70

2021, there have been over 130,000,000 cases and nearly 3,000,000 deaths world-wide

71

(Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center).

72

Nearly every vaccine technology has been deployed to combat this pandemic (reviewed

73

in (1)). mRNA vaccines advanced through the development and regulatory processes

74

most quickly and have been given emergency authorization from the FDA and other

75

international regulators. Replication-defective adenovirus (RD-Ad) gene-based vaccines

76

have also been advanced by several countries and companies, including chimpanzee Ad,

77

human Ad serotype 5 (Ad5), human Ad serotype 26 (Ad26), and others. Each of these

78

vaccines has their strengths and weaknesses, and most will not be revealed until human

79

studies are completed.

80

While many of the advanced vaccines have great promise, they perhaps miss out on two

81

opportunities to combat SARS-CoV-2 and other mucosal pathogens. First, most COVID3

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.20.440651; this version posted April 20, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

82

19 vaccines are administered intramuscularly (IM) and not at the site of SARS-CoV-2

83

entry into the body. Second, most COVID-19 vaccines do not harness the power of

84

transgene replication to amplify antigen production and immune responses.

85

Most Ad vaccines are RD-Ads (reviewed in (2, 3)). For example, the Johnson & Johnson

86

human Ad26 vaccine (4), the ChAdOx1 vaccine from Oxford/AstraZeneca (5), the

87

Russian Sputnik V Ad26 and Ad5 vaccines (6), and most others are RD-Ad vaccines.

88

Converting a wild replication-competent Ad to an RD-Ad is achieved by deleting the

89

adenovirus’ pivotal master regulator gene, E1, to prevent them from causing Ad

90

infections. An RD-Ad can efficiently deliver vaccine genes into cells to transcribe and

91

translate vaccine antigens. However, after gene delivery, the DNA genome of an RD-Ad

92

is not replicated (reviewed in (2, 3)). Therefore, one incoming RD-Ad vaccine antigen

93

gene remains one gene. This gene can be very efficiently expressed, but it is not

94

amplified.

95

By contrast, an E1-intact replication-competent adenovirus (RC-Ad) vector will infect a

96

human cell and replicate an antigen gene DNA up to 10,000-fold in each infected cell (7-

97

18). While RC-Ad vaccines are documented to be more potent than benchmark RD-Ad

98

vectors, RC-Ads can cause actual adenovirus infections in vaccinees (19).

99

We developed single-cycle Ad (SC-Ad) vectors to take advantage of DNA replication

100

while disabling the production of infectious progeny viruses (20-23). SC-Ads retain E1

101

genes and replicate their DNA just as well as RC-Ads, but are deleted for the gene for

102

Ad’s pIIIa capsid cement protein, so that they produce empty defective particles (20). SC-

103

Ads appear able to generate more robust and persistent immune responses than RD-Ads

(21, 24) and have shown promise as vaccines against influenza (24), Ebola virus, HIV-1

105

(25-27), and against Clostridium difficile after single immunization (22, 28).

106

In this work, we generated RD-Ad and SC-Ad vectors expressing the wild-type original

107

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Here, we compare the ability of RD-Ad and SC-Ad to produce

108

the spike protein and generate immune responses in small animals. We also compare

109

the ability of mucosal intranasal (IN) immunization relative to systemic intramuscular (IM)

110

immunization to generate immune responses in systemic and mucosal compartments.

148

accredited facilities and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use

149

Committee (IACUC). Mice and hamsters were housed in the Mayo Clinic Animal Facility.

150

Immunizations. Mice and hamsters were anesthetized with isoflurane prior to

151

immunizations by the indicated routes: intramuscular (IM), intranasal (IN), sublingual

152

(Sub). For intramuscular immunization, 50µL of a solution of virus diluted in PBS was

153

injected into each flank for a total volume of 100µL per animal. Intranasal immunization

154

was performed by pipetting 40µL of a solution of virus diluted in PBS dropwise into the

155

nostrils of each animal. Each animal received a total volume of 40µL, alternating pipetting

156

between nostrils.

157

Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL). BALs were performed as described in (29). Mice were

158

euthanized via CO2 gas, then sterilized with 70% ethanol. Scissors were used to open

159

the chest cavity up to the chin and to expose the trachea. A razor was used to puncture

160

the trachea, and 1mL PBS was pipetted into and out of the lungs. This was repeated 2

161

additional times, giving a total volume of 3mL. Cells were then pelleted out of the

162

bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by centrifugation. The cells were used to run flow cytometry,

163

and the supernatant fluid was used to run ELISA.

program Lung_02. All tubes were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 250 xg, and the contents

171

were transferred to a 50 mL conical tube via a 70 µm mesh. 2.5 mL RPMI with 10% fetal

172

bovine serum was added to the gentleMACS tubes and poured over the mesh to wash.

173

50 mL conical tubes were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 250 xg, and the supernatant was

174

aspirated and discarded. Cell pellets were resuspended in 2 mL ammonium-chloride-

175

potassium lysis buffer and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 350 xg. Supernatants from this

176

reaction were discarded and the cell pellet was washed by resuspending in 2 mL PBS

177

and was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 350 xg. Supernatants were extracted and discarded.

178

The cell pellet was resuspended in desired volume RPMI and analyzed by flow cytometry.

179

Sample Collections. At indicated time points, the animals were anesthetized with

180

isoflurane and serum was collected by cheek bleed in mice or from jugular veins in

181

hamsters. In addition, for bronchoalveolar lavage, the mice were euthanized via CO2 and

182

bronchoalveolar lavage was performed according to the procedure described.

183

Antibody ELISAs. Binding IgG and IgA antibody responses in mouse serum, hamster

184

serum, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were measured by ELISA against spike S1

185

protein and SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain variants. Flat-bottom plates

186

(ThermoFisher) were coated with 10 ng/well of spike S1 antigen in 100 µl PBS or 100

187

ng/well SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain variant antigen in 100 µl PBS, including a

188

triplicate of negative control wells, which received no protein antigen. The protein antigen

189

used for most SARS-CoV-2 ELISAs was recombinant SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) spike

195

S1s with the single D614G and K417N, E484K, N501Y were also tested.

196

Plates were left overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed with 200 µl 1X PBS 2 times,

197

followed by adding 200 µl per well of blocking buffer, consisting of 5% milk powder in

198

TBST, for 2 hours at room temperature. Plates were washed with 200 µl 1X PBS 2 times.

199

All samples were run in triplicate, including a triplicate of positive and negative control

200

wells in each plate. Samples were serially diluted in blocking buffer and were transferred

201

to the assay plate and incubated for 3 hours at room temperature. For the positive control

202

wells, SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody [1A9] (GeneTex) was used as the primary antibody.

203

Plates were washed with 200 µl 1X PBS 4 times, followed by addition of the secondary

204

antibody. For hamster samples, the secondary antibodies used were: Peroxidase

205

Conjugated Affinity Purified Anti-Golden Syrian Hamster IgG (H&L) Goat (Rockland Inc.),

206

and Rabbit Anti-Hamster IgA (Brookwood Biomedical). For mouse samples, the

207

secondary antibodies used were: GOXMO HRP HIGH XADS (Invitrogen), and HRP-Goat

208

Anti-Mouse IgA (Invitrogen). The secondary antibody for the positive controls was Purified

µl 1X PBS 4 times. 50 µl 1-StepTM Ultra TMB-ELISA was added to each well and left at

212

room temperature for 30 minutes, then 50 µl 2M sulfuric acid was added to each well.

213

Plates were read at 450nm in a Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek). All statistical

214

analyses were done by one-way ANOVA.

Neutralization Assays. Pseudo-neutralization assays were performed on hamster

216

serum using the cPassTM Neutralization Antibody Detection kit (GenScript).

217

ELISPOT Assay for Detecting Antigen-specific IFN-γ producing Cells. Freshly-

218

isolated splenocytes were stimulated with spike S1 or S2 subunit protein (1 µg/mL) to

219

determine the numbers of IFN-γ-producing cells by the Enzyme Linked Immuno Spot

220

(ELISPOT) assay using the methodology reported previously (30). Briefly, splenocytes

221

were plated at 2.5 × 105 cells per well in triplicate in 96-well plates. Cells were incubated

222

at 37 °C with medium alone, human papilloma virus E7 peptide (negative control), SARS-

223

CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (1 µg/ml), SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S2 subunit (1

224

µg/ml), tetanus toxoid (TT, negative control, 100ng/ml)), or concanavalin A (Con A),

225

positive control, 10ng/ml. After 24 h, cells were transferred to nitrocellulose plates, coated

226

with anti-IFN-γ antibody, and incubated for 24 more hours. Plates were then washed and

227

incubated with biotinylated anti-IFN-γ antibody, streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase, and

228

colorimetric substrate, with washes between each step. After drying overnight, the plates

229

were read on an AID ELIspot reader (San Diego, CA). Antigen-specific T cells were

230

defined as the average number of spots elicited by the antigen of interest minus the

231

average number of spots elicited when cells were incubated with culture medium alone,

232

without the addition of any peptides.

233

Flow Cytometry. Bronchoalveolar lavage samples were centrifuged at 1500rpm for 5

234

minutes, and the supernatant BAL fluid was removed. The cell pellet was resuspended

235

in 200 µl T-Cell Media (IMDM with 10% FBS, Pen/Strep, and 2-ME), and was then added

236

to a 96-well plate. 2 µl of stimulating mix (500 µg/mL ionomycin, 50 µg/mL PMA, and 445

237

µl T-Cell Media) was added to each well to be stimulated, and was incubated overnight

238

at 37°C. 100 µl of a GolgiPlug Mix (1 µl GolgiPlug/1mL T-Cell Media) was added to each

239

well and thoroughly mixed by pipetting before incubating for 4-6 hours at 37°C. Cells

240

were centrifuged at 1500rpm for 5 minutes and supernatant was removed. Cell surface

241

antibodies were added in 50 µl total volume in FACS Buffer, then incubated 30 minutes

242

on ice. Plates were washed twice with FACS buffer, resuspending cells in FACS Buffer

243

and centrifuging for 5 minutes at 1500rpm to remove supernatant. The cells were then

244

pelleted by centrifugation at 1500rpm for 5 minutes. Cell pellet was resuspended in 100

245

µl of Fix/Perm Solution for 20 minutes at 4°C before being washed twice with 1X BD

246

Perm/Wash Buffer, then centrifuging at 1500rpm for 5 minutes to pellet. Intracellular

247

cytokine antibodies were diluted in 50 µl 1X BD Perm/Wash Buffer and added to each

248

well. Plate was then incubated 30 minutes on ice. Plates were washed twice with 1X BD

249

Perm/Wash Buffer, resuspending cells in 1X BD Perm/Wash Buffer and centrifuging for

250

5 minutes at 1500rpm to remove supernatant. Cells were resuspended in 500 µl 1% PFA

251

and left at 4°C overnight before flow cytometry analysis.

modifications such as proline mutations to alter spike structure (4, 5, 31). This cDNA was

259

inserted into a cytomegalovirus (CMV) expression cassette and was used to generate

260

human adenovirus serotype 6 (HAdV-C6, Ad6) vectors RD-Ad6-spike and SC-Ad6-spike,

261

respectively (Fig. 1A). These vectors were tested for spike protein expression by infection

262

of human A549 lung cells at varied multiplicities of infection (MOI) (Fig. 1B). Western blot

263

on cells harvested 24 hours after infection demonstrated that both vectors produced spike

264

protein; however, RD-Ad-Spike only generated detectable protein with 104 virus particles

265

(vp) per cell, but not with 100 vp/cell. In contrast, SC-Ad-Spike produced protein with 100

or more vp/cell with higher expression than RD-Ad at each dose.

Unfortunately, mice do not support the full life cycle or replication of human adenoviruses

271

(34). Therefore, the administration of SC-Ad to mice may underrepresent the effect of

transgene amplification that would be observed in humans and model organisms that are

273

permissive to human adenovirus infection. In contrast to mice, Syrian hamsters are

274

partially permissive for human adenoviruses (34) and their cells allow 350-fold replication

275

of Ad6 DNA after infection (24). Immunization by RD-Ad and SC-Ad-Spike were therefore

276

compared in Ad6-permissive Syrian hamsters to allow at least partial DNA replication to

277

occur.

278

109 vp of RD-Ad-Spike and SC-Ad-Spike were used to immunize male Syrian hamsters

279

by IN and IM routes. These were compared to negative control RD- and SC-Ad

280

expressing GFP-Luciferase (GL). Animals were immunized a single time and sera were

281

collected at varied times thereafter (Fig. 2). Under these conditions, SC-Ad-Spike

282

generated significantly higher spike antibody levels than RD-Ad-GL or SC-Ad-GL

283

expressing GFP-Luciferase or when compared to RD-Ad-Spike at a fixed dilution

284

(1/1,000) of sera. SC-Ad-Spike delivered by the intramuscular route generated higher IgG

285

at all time points through 6 months after single immunization (p < 0.0001 by ANOVA)

286

(Figs. 2 and 3C and D). SC-Ad-Spike by the intranasal route generated significantly

287

higher IgG in sera at 6 weeks and 14 weeks, but not at 2 weeks and 6 months after single

288

immunization (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.001 at 6 and 14 weeks). Serial dilution of these sera

289

samples revealed reciprocal endpoint spike binding titers of 100 for RD-Ad-Spike by both

290

routes (Fig. 3A). In contrast, SC-Ad-Spike by IN route had reciprocal binding titers of

291

1,000 (p < 0.05). SC-Ad-Spike by the IM route had reciprocal titers of 1,000 or greater (p

292

< 0.0001). This experiment was repeated in female Syrian hamsters with similar results

293

(Supplemental Figs. 2 and 3).

294

Varied dilutions of 6-week sera were assayed for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization antibodies

295

with the cPassTM Neutralization Antibody Detection kit that assays antibodies that block

296

binding of spike receptor binding domain (RBD) to ACE2. Under these conditions, RD-Ad

297

vaccinated hamsters failed to generate significant spike RBD inhibition at any dilution. In

298

contrast, animals immunized with SC-Ad-Spike by the IN and IM route had significantly

299

higher inhibition at all dilutions than RD-Ads within 6 weeks of single immunization (Fig.

300

3B).

301

Antibody Binding to Spike Variants. SARS-CoV-2 has undergone rampant viral

302

evolution as it has infected millions of humans. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variant

303

B.1.1.7 in the UK, B.1.351 in South Africa, P.1 in Brazil, and a rash of other new variants

304

raise significant concerns about the ability of vaccines to protect against them (35-37).

305

These mutations are particularly concerning when they affect antibodies that bind to the

306

ACE2 receptor binding domain, RBD, of spike. The SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 contains

307

H69del, V70del, Y144del, N501Y, A570D, D614G, and P681H mutations. The B.1.351

308

has K417N, E484K, N501Y, and D614G mutations. The P.1 variant bears K417T, E484K,

309

and N501Y mutations (35-37). Mutations in the RBD domain are of most concern

310

considering that they can impact the ability of neutralizing antibodies to block binding of

311

the spike protein to ACE2.

312

Given concerns about these variants, week 14 sera from hamsters immunized IM with

313

the negative control vaccine SC-Ad-GL and SC-Ad-Spike (Fig. 2 and 3) were compared

314

for their ability to bind spike RBD (amino acids 319 to 541) and S1 variants (amino acids

315

16 to 685)(Fig. 4 and Supplemental Fig. 3). The RBD from the original SARS virus was

316

also included as a reference. ELISAs performed at 1/1,000 dilutions demonstrated

317

significant binding by samples from SC-Ad-Spike immunized animals to all the variant

318

RBDs and S1 proteins when compared to SC-Ad-GL samples (p < 0.0001 by one-way

319

ANOVA). SC-Ad-Spike bound the RBD from the original SARS-1 virus, but this did not

320

reach significance at 1/1,000. When the samples were tested at 1/10,000 dilutions binding

321

remained significant with p values remaining less than 0.0001 for all samples except the

322

RBD with combined K417N, E484K, N501Y, which fell to a p value of less than 0.01.

323

ELISA binding to the single E484K RBD was higher at this dilution than to other RBDs,

14

324

suggesting some difference in structure or an artifact. When further 1/20,000 dilutions

325

were tested, binding to all variants was still significantly different between SC-Ad-Spike

326

and SC-Ad-GL samples (p < 0.05 to 0.0001), except for K417N, E484K, N501Y RBD,

327

which was no longer significantly different. While binding to the K417N, E484K, N501Y

328

RBD was lost, binding to the larger S1 protein with K417N, E484K, N501Y, and D614G

329

mutations remained significant (p < 0.01). This was not unexpected, since the larger spike

330

S1 protein has many more epitopes for polyclonal antibody binding.

331

Comparison of the Routes of Immunization by SC-Ad-Spike in Mice. Mice were

332

utilized to evaluate the effects of the route of immunization of SC-Ad-Spike, since few

333

immunological reagents exist to evaluate these responses in hamsters. BALB/c mice

334

were immunized by IN and IM routes with PBS, 1010 vp of SC-Ad expressing Zika E

335

protein, or 1010 vp of SC-Ad-Spike, and antibody responses were evaluated. This 10-fold

336

higher dose was used to compensate for the lack of SC-Ad-Spike DNA replication in the

337

mouse model. Under these conditions, mice immunized with SC-Ad-Spike generated

338

robust IgG antibody responses within 2 weeks of immunization (p < 0.0001 by one-way

339

ANOVA by both routes, Fig. 5).

340

Effects of the Routes of Immunization on Mucosal Antibody Responses in the

341

Lungs. Five animals from selected groups in Fig. 5 were sacrificed 8 weeks after single

342

immunization and bronchoalveolar lavages (BALs) were performed to collect mucosal

343

antibodies and immune cells from the lungs. The 3 mL BAL washes were diluted 1/500

344

and were used to detect anti-spike IgG and IgA antibodies by ELISA. By 8 weeks after

345

single immunization, the mice had significant levels of IgG antibodies in their BALs (p <

15

346

0.01 and 0.001, Fig. 6A). Notably, significant anti-spike IgA antibodies were only

347

observed in IN-immunized mice (p < 0.01). When BAL samples were tested for RBD

348

neutralizing activity, both the IN and IM-immunized mice had significant activities (p <

349

0.01 and 0.05, respectively, Fig. 6B).

350

Effects of the Routes of Immunization on Mucosal T Cell Responses in the Lungs.

351

BAL samples were also examined for the presence of T cells in the lung. The small

352

number of cells obtained and an absence of known spike T cell epitopes for BALB/c mice

353

precluded testing for spike-specific responses; however, when flow cytometry was

354

performed, IFN-g and IL-4-expressing CD4 and CD8 T cells were detected in BAL

355

samples (Fig. 7). These analyses revealed no significant increases in CD4 or CD8 T cells

356

in BAL samples after IM immunization. In contrast, there were significant increases in

357

CD8+ IFN-g+, CD4+ IFN-g+, and CD4+ IL-4+ T cells in the BALs of animals immunized

358

intranasally with either SC-Ad-Zika E or SC-Ad-Spike.

359

Effects of the Routes of Immunization on Systemic T Cell Responses. Splenocytes

360

from the animals in Fig. 7 were assayed for IFN-g, IL-17, and IL-4-expression by ELISPOT

361

after stimulation with spike S1 whole protein subunit (Supplemental Fig. 4). These data

362

demonstrated higher splenocyte IFN-g, IL-17, and IL-4 responses in the BALB/c mice after

363

IN immunization than after IM immunization.

364

DISCUSSION

365

The purpose of this study was to compare RD- and SC-Ad vaccines expressing the

366

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and to evaluate whether mucosal immunization may have

16

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.20.440651; this version posted April 20, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

367

utility when considering vaccines against a mucosal pathogen like SARS-CoV-2. These

368

data suggest that vaccines that retain the ability to replicate their DNA can drive more

369

potent and long-lasting immune responses than non-replicating vaccines. These data

370

also suggest that there may be advantages to delivering vaccines at mucosal sites by

371

single immunization or as a prime followed by later boost.

372

Consistent with previous comparisons, SC-Ad expressed higher levels of antigen than

373

matched RD-Ad vector. This higher expression by SC-Ad-Spike translated into higher

374

serum antibody responses than RD-Ad-Spike in adenovirus-permissive Syrian hamsters

375

after single immunization by either the IM or IN route. The levels of antibodies in sera

376

were higher in animals immunized by the intramuscular route than the intranasal route.

377

In all the animal models, antibody titers were higher in ELISA assays than in varied

378

neutralization assays, as expected. This may reflect, in part, the use of the wild-type spike

379

protein sequence rather than modified spikes locked in the “up” position (4). Use of such

380

a modified spike would likely increase neutralization by SC-Ad.

381

SC-Ad-Spike generated antibodies from these hamsters were able to cross-react in

382

ELISA assays against several single point mutant RBD variants, including those observed

383

in the U.K. B.1.1.7 strain and the South African B.1.351 strain. These antibodies were

384

also able to bind K417N, E484K, N501Y RBD at 1/1,000 and 1/10,000 dilutions in ELISA,

385

but were insignificant at 1/20,000 dilutions. This was not surprising given that the

386

presence of three separate mutations have been shown to affect the ability of Pfizer,

387

Moderna, and other vaccines to recognize these new variants.

388

The single-cycle replication “engine” can be applied to any adenovirus serotype. This

389

increased potency could be utilized in two ways. In one, SC-Ad is delivered at the same

390

virus particle doses as current RD-Ad COVID-19 vaccines to garner stronger immune

391

responses. In the second, SC-Ad is used at a lower dose, perhaps 10 to 100-fold lower,

392

to deliver equal potency to RD-Ad vaccines, but allowing 10 to 100 times more vaccine

393

doses from the same size of a GMP vaccine production run. This could be pivotal for

394

expanding access to vaccines for this pandemic or the next to vaccinate people in rich

395

and poorer countries.

396

Species C human Ad6 was used to test proof of concept since it is equal to or is more

397

robust than species C Ad5 as a vaccine or as an oncolytic (32, 38-42). Species C Ad5

398

and Ad6 also appear to be more robust as gene-based vaccines than lower seroprevalent

399

viruses like species D Ad26 and species E ChAdOx1 (38, 39, 43, 44).

400

Another interesting aspect of this work was examining if there is utility in applying these

401

gene-based vaccines at mucosal surfaces. Hamsters have few immune reagents, so this

402

was examined in more detail in mouse models. In mice, we show that intranasal

403

immunization generated equal IgG antibodies in the lungs of mice, but higher IgA and

404

CD4 and CD8 T cells in BAL samples. Intramuscular immunization was able to generate

405

IgG antibodies in BAL fluid. However, the IM route reduce markedly low IgA antibodies

406

than the IN route. Likewise, IM immunization failed to traffic CD4 or CD8 T cells to the

407

lumen of the lung in contrast to IN mucosal immunization. These data suggest that IN

408

mucosal routes of immunization may do a better job at placing effector antibody and T

409

cells at the sites of earliest exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

410

These observations are consistent with our previous observations testing IN and IM

411

prime-boosts with SC-Ad expressing HIV envelope in rhesus macaques (26). Animals

412

immunized with SC-Ad by only the IM route had lower HIV-1 antibody-dependent cellular

413

cytotoxicity (ADCC) antibody activity and lower levels of peripheral T follicular helper

414

(pTfh) cells in their lymph nodes. Conversely, animals immunized with SC-Ad by the IN

415

route had higher ADCC, higher Tfh cell counts in lymph nodes, and lower SHIV viral loads

416

in their gastrointestinal tracts after rectal SHIV challenge (26). These data suggest that

417

there may be benefits in priming the immune system at mucosal sites when immunizing

418

against pathogens that also enter at these sites.

419

Mucosal immunization may also have utility to impact vaccine safety. There are concerns

420

with observations of thrombotic thrombocytopenia in a small number of people who have

421

received the Ad26 and ChAdOx1 COVID-19 (45, 46). These vaccines were delivered by

422

the intramuscular route. Adenoviruses do not naturally infect the muscle. Ads naturally

423

infect humans at some mucosal site (reviewed in (47)). Injection of anything into the

424

muscle can breach blood vessels and allow leak into the bloodstream. For an

425

intramuscular Ad vaccine, this can cause adenovirus to be absorbed by liver Kupffer cells,

426

liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and to productively infect liver hepatocytes, spleen, or

427

lungs. It is therefore possible that injecting Ads into the muscle by this unnatural route

428

may elevate the risk of side effects. It is possible that delivering adenovirus vaccines by

429

intranasal vaccination may avoid some of these new risks. That having been said, it

430

should be noted that intranasal immunization has its own possible side effects including

431

retrograde transport into the olfactory bulb and Bell’s palsy.

432

Another consideration is the use of adenoviruses that are low seroprevalent in humans.

433

The primary advantage of Ad26 and ChAdOx1 is that few people have been exposed

434

them naturally and so most people do not have neutralizing antibodies against these

435

vaccines. While that is true, it also means that there is less experience with how these

436

viruses behave in humans and what side effects may be observed.

437

In contrast, 27 to 100% of humans are immune to Ad5 (43). Ad6 is lower seroprevalent

438

than Ad5, with 4 to 22% of humans having already been exposed to Ad6 (48, 49). In both

439

cases, these humans have experienced these species C Ads after mucosal exposure

440

without obvious connections to side effects associated with COVID-19 vaccines. One

441

might say that both Ad5 and Ad6 have been field tested as mucosal vaccines in as many

442

as a billion humans. Conversely, no humans have been naturally exposed to Ad5, Ad6,

443

Ad26, or ChAdOx1 by intramuscular exposure.

444

While these common human adenoviruses may have some ironic safety value, it is still

445

possible that arming any adenovirus or any gene-based vaccine with the SARS-CoV-2

446

spike protein may by itself play a role in the observed thrombotic side effects by

447

intramuscular or mucosal routes of vaccination.

448

These concepts need to be explored further. Regardless, this study suggests that

449

mucosal immunization may have value when combating SARS-CoV-2 and other mucosal

450

pathogens. This work also suggests that giving adenovirus vaccines the ability to replicate

451

via single-cycle modifications may have value in increasing per virus potency or by

452

allowing more doses to be produced by using fewer virions per person.
