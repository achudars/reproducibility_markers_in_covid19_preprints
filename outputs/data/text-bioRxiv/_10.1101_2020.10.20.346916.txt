Abstract

25

The coronavirus spike glycoprotein, located on the virion surface, is the key mediator

26

of cell entry. As such, it is an attractive target for the development of protective

27

antibodies and vaccines. Here we describe two human monoclonal antibodies, 1.6C7

28

and 28D9, that display a remarkable cross-reactivity against distinct species from three

29

Betacoronavirus subgenera, capable of binding the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and

30

SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and the endemic human coronavirus HCoV-OC43. Both

31

antibodies, derived from immunized transgenic mice carrying a human immunoglobulin

32

repertoire, blocked MERS-CoV infection in cells, whereas 28D9 also showed weak

33

cross-neutralizing potential against HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in a

34

neutralization-sensitive virus pseudotyping system, but not against authentic virus.

35

Both cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies were found to target the stem helix in the

36

spike protein S2 fusion subunit which, in the prefusion conformation of trimeric spike,

37

forms a surface exposed membrane-proximal helical bundle, that is antibody-

38

accessible. We demonstrate that administration of these antibodies in mice protects

39

from a lethal MERS-CoV challenge in both prophylactic and/or therapeutic models.

40

Collectively, these antibodies delineate a conserved, immunogenic and vulnerabe site

41

on the spike protein which spurs the development of broad-range diagnostic,

42

preventive and therapeutic measures against coronaviruses.

Introduction

45

The Coronavrius Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by the severe acute

46

respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which emerged in China, in late

47

2019 1. The virus belongs to the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus

48

within the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae 2. Two other zoonotic coronaviruses emerged

49

in the last 20 years and cause severe acute respiratory disease in humans, similar to

50

that seen with SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV, which also belongs to the subgenus

51

Sarbecovirus and is closely related to SARS-CoV-2, crossed species barriers to

52

humans in China in 2002, and caused worldwide ~8000 cases with a 10% mortality

53

rate before it was contained in 2003 3. Ten years later in 2012, the Middle East

54

respiratory

55

Betacoronavirus) surfaced in Saudi Arabia. This virus is recurrently introduced in the

56

human population from a dromedary camel reservoir with limited human-to-human

57

spread and has led to ~2500 cases with approximately 35% of reported patients

58

succumbing to the infection 4. In addition, four endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs)

59

circulate in humans, including HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 (genus Alphacoronavirus)

60

and HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (subgenus Embecovirus, genus Betacoronavirus).

61

While these viruses are typically associated with mild respiratory illnesses (common

colds)

84

Coronavirus neutralizing antibodies target the trimeric spike (S) glycoproteins on

85

the viral surface that mediate virus attachment and entry into the host cell. Several

86

cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of trimeric spikes have been

87

determined, with each comprising three S1 receptor binding subunits that collectively

88

cap the trimeric S2 fusion subunit 22-32. Most antibodies neutralize coronavirus infection

89

by binding to the receptor-binding subdomain of S1 and blocking receptor interactions.

90

These antibodies are highly species specific and often strain specific due to a high

91

sequence diversity in the receptor binding sites among coronaviruses, even for those

92

that engage the same receptor (e.g. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2)

93

targeting monoclonal antibodies have been identified that bind regions distal to the

94

receptor binding site and that cross-neutralize coronaviruses within the Sarbecovirus

95

subgenus 21, 34-40 with in vivo protective efficacy 40, 41, providing potential new leads for

96

development of a pan-sarbecovirus vaccine. Neutralizing antibodies that broadly target

97

coronaviruses from distinct (sub)genera are less likely to be found as the overall

98

sequence identity among all coronaviruses spike proteins is low. Relative to the S1

99

subunit, the membrane-anchored S2 subunit, which mediates fusion of the viral and

100

cellular membrane through receptor-induced conformational rearrangements, exhibits

101

a higher level of protein sequence conservation across coronavirus spike proteins.

Structural studies show exposed sites on the S2 base of the spike trimer that might be

Cross-reactivity of human monoclonal antibodies 28D9 and 1.6C7 to spike

113

Five out of seven coronaviruses that are currently known to cause disease in humans

114

belong to the Betacoronavirus genus, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2

115

(subgenus Sarbecovirus), MERS-CoV (subgenus Merbecovirus), and the endemic

116

human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 (subgenus Embecovirus). To

117

elicit and isolate betacoronavirus spike-targeting antibodies with cross-species

118

specificity, we earlier immunized mice with trimeric spike ectodomains (Secto) of three

119

human infecting betacoronaviruses from different subgenera (HCoV-OC43, SARS-

120

143

stronger binding to SARS-Secto, SARS2-Secto and MHV-Secto (Fig. 1a). Both antibodies

144

reacted to S2 ectodomains (S2ecto) of MERS and MHV, indicating that their epitopes

145

were located on the S2 fusion subunit of CoV spike proteins.

146

Biolayer interferometry was used to characterize the binding kinetics and affinity

147

of the cross-reactive antibodies to CoV Secto trimers immobilized on the surface of

148

biosensors. The 1.6C7 mAb bound to the Secto of MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, SARS-

149

CoV and SARS-CoV-2 with equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of 0.58, 5.28 nM

150

and 25.22 and 26.18 μM, respectively, whereas KD’s of the 28D9 mAb with these spike

151

proteins were 0.72, 7.45, 3.17 and 5.96 nM, respectively (Suppl. Fig. 2).

152

To assess whether the 1.6C7 and 28D9 antibodies could bind the full-length (i.c.

153

membrane-anchored) version of spike proteins, we tested their reactivity to cells

154

transiently

155

immunofluoresence microscopy and flow cytometry. Binding of 1.6C7 was observed

156

both in permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells expressing the spike proteins of

157

HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV and MHV, whereas 28D9 additionally bound to cells

158

expressing the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1b, Suppl. Fig. 3

159

and Suppl. Table 1). No reactivity was seen for both antibodies to cells expressing

160

the HCoV-HKU1 spike protein. These data demonstrate that both antibodies can react

161

with full length spike proteins, with specificities that are consistent with the CoV Secto

Next neutralizing activity by both antibodies against the targeted human coronaviruses

166

was assessed. The 1.6C7 and 28D9 antibodies neutralize infection of MERS-S

167

pseudotyped VSV (IC50 values of 0.39 and 0.13 μg/ml, respectively) as well as of

168

authentic MERS-CoV (IC50: 0.083 and 0.93 μg/ml, respectively) (Fig. 2a and b). No

169

neutralization was seen against authentic SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 by either of

170

these antibodies, yet 28D9 displayed low levels of cross-neutralizing activity in the

171

neutralization-sensitive pseudovirus system. 28D9 inhibited OC43-S, SARS-S and

172

SARS2-S pseudotyped VSV infection with IC50 values of 68.4, 60.5 and 45.3 μg/ml,

173

respectively (Fig. 2a).

To understand the mechanism of virus neutralization, we assessed antibody

with our earlier observations for 1.6C7 43, we found that 28D9 inhibits MERS-S driven

181

mAbs 1.6C7 and 28D9 target a linear epitope located in the stem region of the S2

182

183

Both antibodies were tested for competitive binding to MERS-Secto using biolayer

184

interferometry. MERS-Secto binding by 1.6C7 antibody compelety prevented binding of

185

28D9, and vice versa, suggesting that the antibodies target overlapping epitopes (Fig.

186

3a). To assess the epitope conformational specificity, we compared the ELISA

187

reactivity of 1.6C7 and 28D9 to untreated MERS-CoV Secto antigen versus antigen that

188

was heat-denatured in the presence of SDS and DTT. Both antibodies reacted equally

189

well with non-denatured and denatured proteins, unlike a MERS-S1 targeting antibody

190

7.7G6 43 that only reacted with non-denatured antigen. These data indicate that 1.6C7

191

and 28D9 likely bind a linear, contiguous sequence of amino acids in MERS-S (Fig.

192

3b).

193

As both antibodies may bind a linear epitope, we aimed to map their epitope

194

location by ELISA using an array of overlapping synthetic peptides (30-mer peptides

195

with an overlap of 15 residues) covering the conserved C-terminal part of the MERS-

196

S2ecto (residues 869-1,288). Both antibodies appeared to bind a 15-residue-long region

197

(MERS-S residues 1,229-1,243) positioned just upstream of the heptad repeat 2 (HR2)

198

region in the MERS-S2 fusion subunit (Fig. 3c). Analysis of 1.6C7/28D9 antibody

199

binding to N- and C-terminally truncated versions of the 15-mer peptide fragment

200

designated the D1233ELDEFFK1240 MERS-S protein segment as the minimal epitope

201

region still affording some binding by both antibodies (Fig. 3d).

To map residues critical for binding by the 1.6C7/28D9 antibodies, we performed

206

ELISA-based epitope alanine scanning mutagenesis on the 15-mer spike peptide

207

fragment comprising the linear epitope. The alanine scanning analysis of the 15-mer

208

peptide fragment defined three residues (D1236, F1238 and F1239) as critical to binding by

209

both antibodies (Fig. 4a and Suppl. Fig. 4), with another four residues (D1233, E1234,

210

L1235 and E1237) that contribute to binding by 28D9 and - to a lesser extent - by 1.6C7.

211

To corroborate the epitope alanine scanning data, we assessed ELISA reactivity of the

212

1.6C7/28D9 antibodies to single site MERS-Secto mutants containing alanine

213

substitutions in the core epitope region. Consistent to the peptide alanine scanning,

214

alanine substitution of the three residues D1236, F1238 and F1239 abrogated MERS-Secto

215

binding by both antibodies, but not that of the anti-MERS-S1 control antibody 7.7G6

216

(Fig. 4c).

217

To assess the individual contribution to antibody binding of identified residues in

218

the context of the membrane-anchored full-length spike protein, a flow cytometry-

219

based assay was performed measuring antibody binding to cell-surface expressed

220

MERS-S mutants (Fig. 4d). The anti-MERS-S1 7.7G6 antibody was used to control

221

cell surface expression levels of the single-site mutants. With the exception of the

222

L1235A mutant, all mutant spike proteins displayed surface expression levels similar to

223

wildtype. Alanine substitutions of residues in the MERS-S core epitope region

224

(D1233ELDEFFK1240) reduced binding by both antibodies to a varying extent, although

225

analysis of binding data for the L1235A mutant was compromised by reduced cell

226

surface expression level. Consistent with the ELISA-based analysis (Fig. 4a and c),

227

mutation of D1236, F1238 and F1239 most strongly affected binding by both antibodies.

228

Both antibodies showed similar binding patterns in all three antigen binding assays

229

(Fig. 4a, c-d and Suppl. Fig. 4), yet subtle differences in the reactivities were observed

230

that may rationalize differences between these two antibodies and their cross-spike

231

binding properties.

232

The identified residues in the spike epitope region (D1233ELDEFFK1240 in MERS-

233

S) contributing to 1.6C7/28D9 binding are not fully conserved in the targeted

234

betacoronavirus spike proteins, with variations found in three residues (D1233, D1236 and

235

F1238 in MERS-S) that are key to binding by both cross-reactive antibodies (Fig. 4b).

236

To assess contribution of these amino acid variations to antibody reactivity, single site

237

substitutions were made in MERS-S. Soluble and full-length D1233S, D1233E, D1236S,

238

F1238W and F1238Y MERS-S mutants were tested for antibody binding by respectively

239

ELISA (Fig. 4c) and flow cytometry (Fig. 4d), as described above. Substitution of D1233

240

in MERS-S to serine (S, found in HKU1-S) or glutamic acid (E, found in SARS-,

241

SARS2-, OC43- and MHV-S) still allowed efficient binding by both antibodies. In

242

addition, but contrary to the MERS-S F1238A mutant, the MERS-S mutants in which

243

F1238 was replaced by a tryptophan (W, found in HKU1-, OC43- and MHV-S) or tyrosine

244

(Y, found in SARS- and SARS2-S) maintained antibody binding reactivity. These data

245

indicate a degree of sequence variability that is allowed in the epitope region without

246

compromising antibody binding. Particularly, different aromatic residues (Phe, Trp and

247

Tyr) seem to be permitted at residue position 1238. Conversely, the D1236S substitution

248

in MERS-S (found in HKU1-S) fully abrogated binding by both antibodies. The

249

reciprocal S1236D substitution in HKU1-S was sufficient to rescue binding by 28D9, and

250

to a lesser extend by 1.6C7 (Suppl. Fig. 5). These data rationalize the ability of both

251

antibodies to bind spike proteins of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-

252

OC43 and MHV as well as the inability of both antibodies to bind the HCoV-HKU1 spike

253

protein. Evidently, epitope mapping of the two antibodies raised in two different animal

254

immunization experiment revealed that they target the same epitope. We identified a

255

third cross-reactive monoclonal antibody from an independent mouse immunization

256

experiment (DNA+protein immunization), that targets the same site on betacoronavirus

257

spike proteins (mAb 18H2, Suppl. Fig. 6), indicating that this epitope is immunogenic

258

and efficient in the induction of cross-reactive antibodies.

259

Sequence analysis of the variable regions of the 1.6C7, 28D9 and 18H2

260

antibodies identified that their heavy and light chains were derived from the IGHV6-1

261

and IGKV4-1 germline precursor, respectively. Six somatic hypermutation were found

262

in the VH region for 28D9, and five for 1.6C7. Seven somatic hypermutation were found

263

in the VL region for 28D9, and two for 1.6C7 (Suppl. Fig. 7).

264

Glycans on antigens are frequently found to be a determinant for antibody binding.

265

We found that antigen deglycosylation resulted in lower binding of 28D9 to OC43-Secto,

266

MHV-Secto and SARS-Secto using western blotting (Supl. Fig. 8a), in contrast to 1.6C7.

267

We tested the involvement of an N-linked glycan located one residue downstream of

268

the core epitope region (D1233ELDEFFK1240) in MERS-S. This N-glycosylation sequon

270

Deletion of the N1241 glycosylation site in MERS-Secto did not impair binding by both

271

antibodies in ELISA (Suppl. Fig. 8b). In contrast, deletion of the orthologous

272

glycosylation site (N1241) in OC43-Secto fully abrogated ELISA-reactivity of 28D9,

273

whereas that of 1.6C7 was virtually unchanged. These data collectively indicate that

274

epitope features required for 28D9 binding varied among the betacoronavirus spike

275

proteins, with differential involvement of an N-linked glycan in antigen binding.

Although the 28D9/1.6C7 epitope region was present in five betacoronavirus spike

four dromedary camel MERS-CoV-positive sera on 905 overlapping peptides covering

the entire spike protein ectodomain (MERS-S residues 1-1,296) identified sixteen

Antibody mediated protection of mice challenged with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV

317

To assess the in vivo protection capacity of antibodies targeting the stem-helix epitope,

318

we tested the prophylactic and therapeutic activity of the 1.6C7 mAb against lethal

319

MERS-CoV challenge using the K18-hDPP4 transgenic mouse model expressing

320

human DPP4 46. 20-30-week-old mice were injected with 50 μg of antibody (equivalent

321

to 1.8 mg mAb per kg body weight) by intraperitoneal injection 24 hours before (pre-)

322

or 24 hours after infection (post-) with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV. A highly potent

323

MERS-CoV neutralizing antibody 7.7G6, and an irrelevant IgG1 isotype control

antibody

325

weight change was monitored daily for 10 days. In isotype control pre- and post-

326

treated mice, MERS-CoV causes lethal disease with 100% lethality between 8 and 10

327

days and showed significant weight loss. In contrast, both pre- and post- treatment of

328

1.6C7 protected mice from death, and that of 7.7G6 protect 80-100% of mice from

329

death. Relative to isotype control treated mice, mice treated with either 7.7G6 or 1.6C7

330

showed reduced weight loss (Fig. 7a).

To investigate the reduction in pathology and viral loads, lungs of mice were

332

harvested on day 3 (3 animals) and 8-10 (5 animals) post infection. In isotype control

333

treated mice, no obvious difference of viral RNA was observed compared to non-

334

antibody treated (Mock-treated) mice. However, mice treated with 1.6C7 before or after

335

virus challenge, demonstrated 1-2 log reduction in viral RNA titers on day 3 post

336

exposure, whereas a 2-3 log reduction was seen at 8-10 dpi (Suppl. Fig. 11a). A

337

similar reduction was seen for the isolation of infectious virus at day 3, whereas at day

338

8-10 post exposure no infectious virus could be isolated from the lungs of the 1.6C7

339

pre- and post-exposure treated mice (Suppl. Fig. 11a). Mice treated with 1.6C7 before

340

and after infection showed greatly reduced lung pathology and inflammation following

341

MERS-CoV infection at day 3 and 8-10, consistent with viral RNA levels and virus titers

Discussion

353

We report two human monoclonal antibodies that are able to bind the spike proteins of

354

betacoronaviruses from three different subgenera. Both antibodies were found to

355

target a conserved and immunogenic epitope in membrane-proximal stem region on

356

the S2 fusion subunit, that is also recognized by the immune system during natural

357

infection. Antibodies targeting this antigenic site prevented mortality and disease in

358

mice upon MERS-CoV infection, demonstrating the relevance of the epitope for

359

providing protection.

360

The observed antibody cross-reactivities are remarkable since the spike protein

361

sequences of the five targeted betacoronaviruses (MHV, HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV,

362

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) are highly divergent and share only about 15% overall

363

protein sequence identity with 26% identity across the more conserved S2 fusion

364

subunit. Three residues in the stem helix epitope region appeared to be critical for

365

antibody binding. Two of those appeared fully conserved in the targeted

366

betacoronavirus spike sequences (D1236 and F1239 in MERS-S), whereas only aromatic

367

amino acids residues were found at the third position (F1238 in MERS-S), indicative of

368

functional conservation. Location of the epitope was corroborated by the gain-of-

369

function binding for the HCoV-HKU1 spike protein upon serine substitution at MERS-

370

S equivalent position D1236. The small number of (functionally) conserved key residues

371

targeted by both antibodies and the involvement of a conserved N-linked glycan may

372

rationalize their binding to these highly divergent antigens 47, 48.

373

We showed that the stem-helix targeting antibodies effectively blocked MERS-

374

CoV infection in cultured cells and provided prophylactic and therapeutic protection to

375

mice against a lethal dose MERS-CoV challenge. This epitope was hitherto not

376

described as a target of neutralizing antibodies, although monoclonal antibodies with

377

neutralizing activity were found to target the sequences flanking the stem-helix epitope,

378

including the downstream HR2 region

379

mediated through extensive conformational rearrangements, particularly in the epitope

49-51

. Membrane fusion by the S2 subunit is

380

containing region. Elucidation of pre- and post-fusion spike structures reveals that

381

dissociation of the three epitope-containing stem-helices in the prefusion spike trimer

382

is required for formation of the highly stable postfusion structure 31, 45, 52, 53. Though the

383

precise mechanism of neutralization by these two antibodies remains to be defined, at

384

least two mechanisms of neutralization are conceivable: the binding of antibodies may

385

destabilize the bundle of stem helices in the prefusion spike protein initiating premature

386

spike activation. Alternatively, antibody binding may obstruct six-helix bundle formation

387

of the spike protein during fusion 54. Intriguingly, despite having different conformations

388

resulting from the structural rearrangement during fusion, the epitope in pre- and post-

389

fusion spike conformation could still be bound by both antibodies, suggesting either

390

epitope recognition of the structurally conserved part of the epitope in the two spike

391

conformations, or through an ‘induced fit’ mechanism at the binding interface 55.

392

Neutralization of authentic human-infecting coronaviruses, other than MERS-CoV,

393

was not observed by these two antibodies, although weak cross-neutralizing capacity

394

against pseudotyped viruses was seen for 28D9. This monoclonal antibody displayed

395

high ELISA-reactivity to the spike proteins of HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2.

396

The lack of robust cross-neutralization by 28D9 may result from the approximately 5-

397

to 10-fold higher equilibrium dissociation constants towards these spike proteins,

398

relative to MERS-S, inferred by subtle differences in epitope composition. Structural

399

insight into the 28D9 antibody binding mode to the stem helix epitope of targeted CoV

400

spike proteins may guide antibody affinity improvement by structure-based design to

401

increase breadth of neutralization.

402

The conserved stem helix epitope appears to be highly immunogenic. This is

403

demonstrated by the independent isolation of three cross-reactive antibodies (28D9,

404

1.6C7 and 18H2) all targeting the stem-helix epitope from three independent mouse

405

immunization experiments. In addition, antibodies towards this epitope are also elicited

406

during natural infection, as demonstrated by the spike protein peptide microarray

407

analysis using MERS-CoV-positive human and dromedary camel sera. Moreover,

408

recent spike protein peptide microarray analyses by Li et al. 56 revealed that the SARS-

409

CoV-2 peptide F1148KEELDKYFKNH1159 encompassing the 28D9/1.6C7 targeted stem

410

helix epitope (underlined in sequence) was recognized by serum antibodies in ~90%

411

of COVID-19 patients, whereas Ladner et al.

413

- as the most widely-recognized SARS-CoV-2 linear epitope target in convalescent

414

donors. It is tempting to speculate that the exceptionally high seroprevalence of stem-

415

epitope targeting antibodies in COVID-19 patients is due to boosting of pre-existing

416

immune response towards this conserved epitope resulting from earlier encounters

417

with betacoronaviruses such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 that are endemic in

418

humans

other conserved spike epitopes play a role in cross-protection or enhanced disease

21

. Whether cross-reactive antibodies in humans towards the stem-helix or

421

Together, the isolated cross-reactive antibodies define a conserved, immunogenic

422

and vulnerabe site on the coronavirus spike protein. The discovery of eptiopes on viral

423

glycoproteins targeted by cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies has fueled the design

424

of broad range therapeutics and vaccines for other RNA viruses that display antigenic

425

variation or show zoonotic potential, such as HIV-1 and influenza viruses 13, 15, 58-60. We

426

made a first step into the identification of conserved sites among antigenically highly

427

divergent coronavirus spike proteins. These efforts may enable the new generation of

428

broadly protective vaccines and therapeutics, that can mitigate the potential risk of

429

antigenic drift upon continuous circulation of coronaviruses in the population, as well

430

as the looming threat of novel coronavirus emergence in humans.

439

accession number: P11224) fused with a C-terminal T4/GCN4 trimerization motif, a

440

thrombin cleavage site and a Strep-tag purification tag were cloned in-frame into

441

pMT\Bip\V5\His expression vector. The furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 junction was

449

752–1262; strain EMC; GB: YP_009047204.1) were cloned in-frame between the HBM

450

secretion signal peptide and a triple Strep-tag for purification in the pFastBac transfer

451

vector. Generation of bacmid DNA and recombinant baculovirus was performed

452

according to protocols from the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). All secreted proteins

453

were purified from culture supernatant using streptactin beads (IBA) following the

454

manufacturer's protocol. All variants were generated using Q5® High-Fidelity DNA

455

Polymerase (NEB)-based site-directed mutagenesis.

457

Generation of cross-reactive H2L2 mAbs. Six H2L2 mice were sequentially

458

immunized in two weeks intervals with purified spike ectodomains of different CoVs in

459

CoV and MERS-CoV. Antigens were injected at 20-25 μg/mouse using Stimune

461

Adjuvant (Prionics) freshly prepared according to the manufacturer’s instruction for the

462

first injection, while boosting was done using Ribi (Sigma) adjuvant. Injections were

463

done subcutaneously into the left and right groin each (50 μl) and 100 μl

464

intraperitoneally. Four days after the last injection, spleen and lymph nodes were

465

harvested, and hybridomas made by standard method using SP 2/0 myeloma cell line

466

(ATCC #CRL-1581) as a fusion partner. Hybridomas were screened in an antigen-

467

specific ELISA and positives selected for further development, subcloned and

468

produced on a small scale (100 ml of medium). For this purpose, hybridomas were

469

cultured in serum- and protein-free medium for hybridoma culturing (PFHM-II (1X),

470

Gibco) with addition of non-essential amino acids (100X NEAA, Biowhittaker Lonza,

471

cat. no. BE13-114E). H2L2 antibodies were purified from hybridoma culture

472

supernatants using Protein-G affinity chromatography. Purified antibodies were stored

473

at 4oC for further use. DNA immunizations of H2L2 mice were done in two weekly

474

intervals with spike protein expression plasmids in the following order: pCAGGS-

475

OC43-S, pCAGGS-SARS-S and pCAGGS-MERS-S. During the procedure that

476

involved shaving of the lower back, intradermal DNA injection (40-50 μg of DNA per

477

mouse in 20-30 μl volume) and electroporation, mice were anesthetized.

478

Electroporation was done according to instructions of manufacturer of the

479

electroporation apparatus (Agile plus ID in vivo delivery system, BTX). In short,

483

Blood samples will be taken after the 4th DNA injectiion/electroporation. Five mice that

484

developed satisfactory ELISA titres for all 3 antigens after DNA priming were

485

additionally injected subcutaneously in two weeks intervals with 25 μg of each of the

486

soluble trimeric spike proteins with Ribi adjuvant. 3-5 days after the last injection, mice

487

were sacrificed and spleens and lymph nodes used to make a single cell suspension

recombinant human antibodies using HEK-293T was described previously

495

the variable heavy (VH) and light (VL) chain sequences were amplified from cDNA and

separately cloned into the expression plasmids with human IgG1 heavy chain and

497

kappa chain constant regions, respectively (Invivogen). Both plasmids contain the

498

interleukin-2 signal sequence to enable efficient secretion of recombinant antibodies.

499

Recombinant human antibodies were expressed in HEK-293T cells following transient

500

transfection with pairs of the IgG1 heavy and light chain expression plasmids according

501

to protocols from Invivogen. Recombinant antibodies were purified using Protein A

502

sepharose (IBA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. mAb 1.6C7 and 7.7G6

503

used in the animal experiments were produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells

504

as previously described 61. The VH and VL sequences were synthesized by GeneArt,

505

ThermoFisher and cloned into OriP-containing expression vectors, suitable for IgG1

506

production 62. A 20 L cell culture in a disposable rocking bioreactor was subsequently

551

Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 5 mM EDTA and 0.02% NaN3 in PBS) were centrifuged at

552

400×g for 10 min. Cells were then treated with/without 0.1% Triton-100 after fixation in

553

3.7% paraformaldehyde. After a washing step in PBS, cells were blocked using 10%

554

Normal Goat Serum (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, the Netherlands) diluted in PBS

555

for 45 min at RT. Staining of spike proteins was performed by incubation of the cells

556

with primary antibody (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at RT. They were then incubated with 1:200

557

diluted Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated goat anti-human IgG secondary antibody

558

(Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 45 min at RT and subjected to flow cytometric

559

analysis with a CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman). The results were analysed by

560

FlowJo (version 10) and percentage of GFP+Alexa Fluor 594+ cells over GFP+ cells

561

were calculated.

563

Antibody binding kinetics and affinity measurement. The measurement of binding

564

kinetics and affinity of antibodies to CoV spike ectodomains was performed using

565

biolayer interferometry (Octet RED384 machine) as described before

566

human antibodies with optimal concentration (44 nM) which showed the desired

567

loading curve characteristics and high signal in the association step were loaded onto

568

Protein A biosensors for 10 min. Binding of CoV spikes was performed by incubating

569

the biosensor with various concentrations of recombinant spike ectodomain (1600-

570

800-400-200-100-50-25-12.5-6.25 nM) for 10 min followed by the dissociation step

571

which was run long enough (60 min) to observe the decrease of the binding response.

reporter gene at a MOI of 1. Twenty-four hours later, supernatant was harvested and

585

filtered through 0.45 μm membrane. Pseudotyped VSV virus were titrated on

586

monolayer African green monkey kidney VeroCCL81 cells (MERS-S pseudotyped

587

VSV), VeroE6 cells (SARS-S and SARS2-S pseudotyped VSV) or on HRT-18 cells

588

(OC43-S pseudotyped VSV). In the virus neutralization assay, serially diluted mAbs

589

were pre-incubated with an equal volume of virus at RT for 1 h, and then inoculated on

590

Vero/HRT-18 cells, and further incubated at 37℃. After 20 h, cells were washed once

591

with PBS and lysed with cell lysis buffer (Promega). The expression of firefly luciferase

592

was measured on a Berthold Centro LB 960 plate luminometer using D-luciferin as a

593

substrate (Promega). The percentage of infectivity was calculated as the ratio of

594

luciferase readout in the presence of mAbs normalized to luciferase readout in the

595

absence of mAb. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were determined

596

using 4-parameter logistic regression (GraphPad Prism v7.0).

597
598

Authentic virus neutralization assay. Neutralization of authentic MERS-CoV, SARS-

599

CoV and SARS-CoV-2 was performed using a plaque reduction neutralization test

600

(PRNT) as described earlier, with some modifications 65, 66. In brief, mAbs were serially

601

diluted and mixed with MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 for 1 hour. The mixture

602

was then added to Huh-7 cells (MERS-CoV) or VeroE6 cells (SARS-CoV and SARS-

603

CoV-2) and incubated for 1 hr, after which the cells were washed and further incubated

604

in medium for 8 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed, fixed, permeabilized and the

605

infection was detected using immunofluorescent staining using antibodies specific for

606

the viruses used. The signal was developed using a precipitate forming TMB substrate

607

(True Blue, KPL) and the number of infected cells per well were counted using the

608

ImmunoSpot® Image analyzer (CTL Europe GmbH). The half maximal inhibitory

609

concentrations (IC50) were determined using 4-parameter logistic regression

618

at RT. The mixture was added to the plate for 1 h at RT, after which plates were washed

619

three times. Binding of MERS-CoV S ectodomain to DPP4 was detected using 1:1000

620

diluted HRP-conjugated anti-StrepMAb (IBA) that recognizes the Strep-tag affinity tag

621

on the MERS-CoV S ectodomain. Detection of HRP activity was performed as

622

described above (ELISA section).

623
624

Fusion inhibition assay. Fusion inhibition assay was perfomed as described 43, with

625

some adaptations. Huh-7 cells were seeded one day before reaching a confluency of

626

70-80%. Cells were transfected with pCAGGS expression plasmid encoding full-length

627

MERS-S C-terminally fused with a GFP-tag using Lipofectamine 2000. The furin

628

cleavage site R747SVR751 at S1/S2 junction was mutated to KSVR to avoid the

629

cleavage by endogenous proteases. At 48 h post transfection, cells were pre-treated

630

with DMEM only or DMEM with 20 μg/ml mAbs for 1 h and subsequently treated with

631

DMEM with 20 μg/ml of exogenous trypsin to activate the spike fusion function at 37˚C

632

for 2 h. Cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde after observation of the syncytia

633

formation. 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to stain the nuclei. The

634

expression of MERS-S was confirmed based on the GFP signal, and the cell-cell fusion

635

was monitored by large GFP-fluorescent muti-nucleated syncytia. The fluorescence

636

images were recorded using the EVOS FL fluorescence microscope (Thermo Fisher

637

Scientific, the Netherlands).

639

Antibody binding competition assay. Antibody binding competition was performed

640

using biolayer interferometry (Octet Green; ForteBio), as described previously

641

brief, MERS-CoV spike antigen 50 μg/ml was immobilized onto the anti-strep mAb-

642

coated protein A biosensor. After a brief washing step, the biosensor tips were

643

immersed into a well containing primary mAb at a concentration of 50 μg/ml for 15 min

644

and subsequently into a well containing the competing mAb (secondary mAb) at a

645

concentration of 50 μg/ml for 15 min. A 5-min washing step in PBS was included in

646

between steps.

652

one or two residues. Order of these peptides was randomized, when synthesized on

653

mini-cards. ELISA reactivity of 5 human (H1 to H5) and 4 dromedary camel (D1 to D4)

654

MERS-positive sera was assessed, as well as a MERS-negative serum from human

655

(H-CTRL) or camel (D-CTRL). The binding of antibody to each of the synthesized

656

peptides was tested in a PEPSCAN-based ELISA. The peptide arrays were incubated

657

with the primary antibody solution (overnight at 4°C). After washing, the peptide arrays

658

were incubated with a 1/1000 dilution of an appropriate antibody peroxidase conjugate

659

(goat anti-human HRP conjugate, Southern Biotech, cat. no.: 2010-05 or goat anti-

660

lama HRP conjugate, Abcore, cat. no. AC15-0354) for 1 h at 25°C. After washing, the

661

peroxidase substrate 2,2’-azino-di-3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate (ABTS) and 20

662

μl/ml of 3% H2O2 was added. After 1 h, the color development was measured and

663

quantified with a charge coupled device (CCD) - camera and an image processing

664

system. The values obtained from the CCD camera range from 0 to 3000 mAU.

665

Samples were scaled per serum sample using a cut-off of twice the mean absorbance

666

obtained for each serum. The use of human materials was approved by the local

667

medical ethical committee (MEC approval: 2014-414).

668

To map the epitopes of the monoclonal antibodies, 30-amino acid long peptides

669

(with 15-a.a. overlap) were synthesized (Genscript) covering the conserved C-terminal

670

part of the MERS-S2 ectodomain (residues 869-1,288). 100 ng/well of each peptide

671

was coated onto 96-well NUNC Maxisorb plate at 4°C overnight. Followed by three

672

washing steps with PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween-20), plates were blocked with 5%

673

milk (Protifar, Nutricia) in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 at RT for 3 h. Antibodies were

674

allowed to bind to the plates at 4-fold serial dilutions, starting at 10 μg/ml, at RT for 1

675

h. Antibody binding to the peptides was determined using a goat anti-human IgG HRP

676

conjugate (ITK Southern Biotech) for 1 h at RT and tetramethylbenzidine substrate

677

(BioFX). Readout for binding was done as described in the ELISA section. To identify

678

critical residues for mAb binding, a single alanine mutation was introduced on the 15-

679

mer spike peptide fragment that comprises the linear epitope. Reactivity of antibodies

680

with peptides with a single alanine substitution was measured by ELISA according to

681

the method described above.

CoV 46. Groups of 8 mice, 20-30 weeks old, were given 50 μg of 1.6C7 (equivalent to

687

1.8 mg of the antibody per kg) by intraperitoneal injection, 24 hours before or after

688

intranasal infection with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV (EMC isolate; 5 x 103 PFU/mouse).

689

The potent neutralizing anti-MERS-S1 control antibody 7.7G6

690

matched negative control mAb were taken along as controls. In a second experiment,

691

the prophylactic efficacy of mAb 28D9 was tested against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV

692

infection in the K18 TghDpp4 mouse model. Groups of 16-20-week old mice (n=5),

693

were given 50 or 200 μg 28D9 or isotype control antibody (equivalent to 1.8 or 7.2 mg

694

of the antibody per kg, respectively) by intraperitoneal injection, 24 h before intranasal

695

infection with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV (EMC isolate; 5 × 103 PFU/mouse) or mouse

696

adapted SARS-CoV (strain SARS-CoV-MA15-WT-M2; 1 × 105 PFU/mouse). Animal

697

protection studies were done under the animal permit PROEX-199/19, approved by

698

the Community of Madrid (Spain), and performed in biosafety level 3 facilities at CISA-

700

MERS-CoV titers and lung histopathology were tested as described earlier 65. To

701

analyze MERS-CoV titers, one fourth of the right lung was homogenized using a MACS

702

homogenizer (Miltenyi Biotec) according to manufacturer’s protocols. Virus titrations

703

were performed on Huh-7 cells following standard procedures. In brief, cells were

704

overlaid with DMEM containing 0.6% low-melting agarose and 2% FBS, fixed with 10%

705

formaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet at 72 h post infection. The left lung

706

of infected mice was fixed in 10% zinc formalin for 24 h at 4ºC and paraffin embedded

707

for lung histopathological examination. Serial longitudinal 5 µm-sections of formaling

708

were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and subjected to histopathological

709

examination with a ZEISS Axiophot fluorescence microscope. Samples were obtained

710

using a systematic uniform random procedure, consisting in serial parallel slices made

711

at a constant thickness interval of 50 µm.
