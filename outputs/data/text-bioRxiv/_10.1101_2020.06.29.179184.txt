ABSTRACT (250/250)

29
30

Background

31

RT-PCR testing is crucial in the diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The use of reliable and

32

comparable PCR assays is a cornerstone to allow use of different PCR assays depending on

33

the local equipment. In this work, we provide a comparison of the Cobas® (Roche) and the

34

RealStar® assay (Altona).

35

Methods

36

Assessment of the two assays was performed prospectively in three reference Parisians

37

hospitals, using 170 clinical samples. They were tested with the Cobas® assay, selected to

38

obtain a distribution of cycle threshold (Ct) as large as possible, and tested with the RealStar

39

assay with three largely available extraction platforms: QIAsymphony (Qiagen), MagNAPure

40

(Roche) and NucliSENS-easyMag (BioMérieux).

41

Results

42

Overall, the agreement (positive for at least one gene) was 76%. This rate differed

43

considerably depending on the Cobas Ct values for gene E: below 35 (n = 91), the

44

concordance was 99%. Regarding the positive Ct values, linear regression analysis showed a

45

determination correlation (R2) of 0.88 and the Deming regression line revealed a strong

46

correlation with a slope of 1.023 and an intercept of -3.9. Bland-Altman analysis showed that

47

the mean difference (Cobas® minus RealStar®) was + 3.3 Ct, with a SD of + 2.3 Ct.

48

Conclusions

49

In this comparison, both RealStar® and Cobas® assays provided comparable qualitative

50

results and a high correlation when both tests were positive. Discrepancies exist after 35 Ct

51

and varied depending on the extraction system used for the RealStar® assay, probably due to

52

a low viral load close to the detection limit of both assays.

INTRODUCTION (2104/3000)

54

The SARS-CoV-2 is the new coronavirus, a member of the subgenus Sarbecovirus (beta-

55

Coronavirus lineage B), responsible for the ongoing pandemic of infectious respiratory

56

disease called COVID-19 (1, 2). This epidemic, declared a Public Health Emergency of

57

International Concern on 30 January 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO), has

58

spread rapidly around the world and has caused many infections and deaths worldwide (3). To

59

control the outbreaks, many countries have implemented confinement instructions and have

60

closed places of groupings with heavy economic consequences. As recommended by WHO,

61

diagnostic tests by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) via respiratory

62

samples, should be performed widely to detect infected patients, to follow the pandemic

63

evolution and to help stopping the spread of the clusters (4). RT-PCR testing is also a

64

cornerstone to allow a gradual deconfinement in good sanitary conditions and early detect any

65

viral resurgence. To meet the high demand for these tests and to face the supply difficulties

66

worldwide, the laboratories had to adapt using the different systems available depending on

67

the PCR and nucleic acid extraction equipment already present in their establishment (5–10).

68

Manufacturer-independent evaluation data are still scarce. These tests can be a single-use

69

cartridge, reagent kits for batch testing used with different instruments for the extraction and

70

amplification stages, or fully automated molecular testing platforms. These are real-time RT-

71

PCR which target two or three different regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and provide a

72

cycle threshold (Ct) value inversely proportional to the amount of virus. Pre-analytical

73

processing of respiratory samples can be also used to neutralize the virus before testing, and

74

the sample input volume used varies depending on the test performed. All these differences in

75

the pre-analytical and analytical process can have an impact on the sensitivity of the test and

76

the concordance of their results has to be evaluated.

In this study, we compared two different widely used tests in three major Parisian university

79

hospital laboratories. These are the RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit 1.0 (Altona

80

diagnostics, France) which can be associated to different extraction and amplification devices,

81

and the Cobas® SARS-CoV-2 kit used on the Cobas® 6800 system (Cobas 6800; Roche

82

Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).

84

METHODS

85

Samples

86

In April 2020, 140 patients were included in this prospective study performed in 3 virological

87

laboratories located in Paris (Saint Louis hospital (n=45), Bichat hospital (n=49) and La Pitié-

88

Salpêtrière hospital (n=46)). Then, each laboratory selected 45 to 49 samples firstly detected

89

using the Cobas 6800 with a stratification according to the Ct of the E gene Cobas results,

90

allowing to cover the whole linear range of the assays. Thus, three categories were retained:

91

Ct < 25, Ct between 25 and 34 and with a Ct > 35. Rapidly, in the same day or within 48

92

hours, the leftover samples stored at +4°C were tested with the RealStar assay. Thirty

93

nasopharyngeal swab samples collected in 2019 (in the pre-epidemic Covid 19 period) were

94

also tested with both techniques (10 in each laboratory).

95
96

Cobas 6800 SARS-CoV-2 test

97

The Cobas® SARS-CoV-2 test is a single-well dual target assay, which targets the non-

98

structural ORF1a/b region specific of SARS-CoV-2 and the structural protein envelope E

99

gene for pan-sarbecovirus detection. The test used RNA internal control for sample extraction

100

and PCR amplification process control. To take into account the available sample volume and

101

the security conditions required for this virus before loading on the Cobas 6800 system, the

102

pre-analytical protocol has been adapted as recommended by the manufacturer as follows:

103

400 μl of each sample were transferred at room temperature into barcoded secondary tubes

104

containing 400 μl of Cobas lysis buffer for the SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Then, the tube

105

was loaded on the Cobas 6800 where 400 μl from those 800 μl were used for RNA extraction,

106

and eluted in 50 μl of which 27 µl were used for the RT-PCR. The test was performed in

107

batches, including one negative and positive control each. According to the manufacturer’s

108

instructions, a tested sample was considered SARS-CoV-2 positive if Cobas 6800 showed

109

positive results either for both ORF1a/b and E genes or for the ORF1a/b gene only. In the

110

case of single E gene positivity, the result should be reported as SARS-CoV-2 presumptive

111

positive and repeated, but were considered as positive for this study.

112
113

RealStar SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR

114

The RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit 1.0 assay targets the E gene specific for

115

sarbecoviruses, and the S gene specific for SARS-CoV-2. It includes a heterologous

116

amplification system (Internal Control) to identify possible RT-PCR inhibition and to confirm

117

the integrity of the kit reagents. This kit contains only reagents for the SARS-CoV-2 real-time

118

RT-PCR step, extraction and amplification can be performed with various equipment listed in

119

the kit insert. In this study, RNA extraction was performed with MagNA Pure LC 2.0 System

120

(Roche) (Bichat hospital), QIAsymphony (Qiagen) (Saint Louis hospital) and NucliSENS®

121

EasyMag® (bioMérieux) (Saint Louis hospital and Pitié Salpêtrière hospital) according to

122

manufacturer’s protocol. In each cases, 200 µl of nasopharyngal samples were diluted in 2 ml

123

of lysis buffer and eluted in 50 µl. Ten µl of extracted RNA was used to perform the real-time

124

RT-PCR with the LightCycler® 480 (Roche) in Pitié Salpêtrière hospital or the ABI Prism®

125

7500 SDS (Applied Biosystems) in the two other laboratories. All these instruments are listed

126

into the RealStar assay instructions. The sample was considered as positive if at least one of

127

both targets was detected.

128
129

Statistical analysis

130

Statistical analyses were performed on GraphPad Prism version 6.0. The negative results

131

obtained with the RealStar test were excluded from the analyses. All tests were two-sided,

132

with p values of <0.05 denoting statistical significance. The Ct values obtained with both

133

assays were compared in Wilcoxon tests, and we presented correlation curves with the

coefficient of determination, R2. Bland-Altman analysis was used to represent the degree of

135

agreement between the Cobas 6800 System and the RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR based

136

on the mean difference and standard deviation (SD) of the positive results. The comparison

137

between the EasyMag and QIAsymphony extraction was done with a paired-samples Student

138

test.

RESULTS

140

Comparison of the Cobas® 6800 System with the RealStar® kit

141

A total of 170 patient samples were included in this study: 30 collected in 2019, before the

142

French epidemic period, and 140 with a positive detection for SARS-CoV-2 with the Cobas

143

6800. All the 30 samples collected in 2019 before the epidemic period were negative with

144

both Cobas 6800 and RealStar assays. The qualitative results of the 140 selected samples are

145

summarized in Table 1. Overall, the agreement (positive with the two tests regardless of the

146

gene detected) was 76%. Of note, 3 samples positive in gene E with the COBAS 6800 were

147

negative in gene E but positive in gene S with the RealStar assay. However, this rate differed

148

considerably depending on the Cobas 6800 E Ct: below 35 (n = 91), the concordance was

149

99%. Only one sample with a Cobas 6800 E Ct at 34.3 was negative in RealStar assay with an

150

EasyMag extraction. For samples with a Cobas 6800 E Ct ≥ 35 (n = 49) only 14/49 was

151

positive in both techniques with a concordance of 29%.

152

For the gene E Ct < 35 obtained with Cobas® 6800, the median of the value obtained with

153

RealStar® assay was 23.5, 23.4 and 18.6 with EasyMag, QIAsymphony and MagNA Pure,

154

respectively. Moreover, for samples with a Ct > 35 with Cobas 6800 (n=49), the detection rate

155

observed with the RealStar assay differed depending on the extraction system, 1/13 with

156

EasyMag, 1/15 with the QIAsymphony and 13/21 with MagNA Pure.

157

Regarding the positive Ct values of gene E (n=104), linear regression analysis revealed a R2

158

of 0.88 and the Deming regression line revealed a strong correlation with a slope of 1.023 and

159

an intercept of -3.9 (Fig. 1a). The Bland Altman plot showed higher Ct values for the Cobas

160

6800 with a homogeneous distribution up to Ct 35 with a mean difference (Cobas 6800 minus

161

RealStar) of + 3.3 Ct and a SD of + 2.3 Ct (Fig. 1b).

163

Comparison of the RealStar results after extraction with EasyMag and QIAsymphony

164

systems

165

In Saint Louis hospital, 45 samples previously detected with the Cobas 6800 (15 with a Ct <

166

25, 15 with a Ct between 25 and 34 and 15 with a Ct > 35) were extracted both with the

167

EasyMag kit and the QIAsymphony kit before RealStar testing. All the samples with a Ct <

168

35 (n=30) were positive regardless of the extraction system. Among the 15 samples with a

169

Cobas 6800 Ct > 35, all were negative after EasyMag extraction while 2 samples were

170

positive after QIAsymphony extraction (Ct: 34.9 and Ct: 38.8). We found a R2 of 0.99 and the

171

Deming regression revealed a strong correlation with a slope of 0.99 and an intercept of -0.81

172

(Fig. 2a). Bland-Altman analysis showed that the mean difference (QIAsymphony minus

173

EasyMag) was + 1.1 Ct, with a SD of - 0.70 Ct (Fig. 2b). Two differences exceeded 5 Ct

174

corresponding to the 2 samples positive using QIAsymphony and negative with EasyMag.

175

Although there was no significant difference in Ct values for the gene E (p=0.21), we have a

176

significant difference in Ct values for the gene S (p<0.0001, mean Ct gene S=1.19, 95% CI:

177

1.95 to 1.63) in favor of EasyMag.

178
179

Comparison of the detection of gene E and ORF for Cobas 6800

180

Amplification of gene E (139/140, 99.3%) was more frequently positive compared to

181

amplification of gene ORF (115/140, 82.1%). A R2 of 0.84 and the Deming regression line

182

revealed a good correlation with a slope of 1.22 and an intercept of -6.3.

183
184

Comparison of the detection of gene E and S for RealStar® RT-PCR

185

Amplification of gene E (104/140, 74.3%) and amplification of gene S (115/140, 82.1%)

186

seem to be equivalent. A R2 of 0.93 and the Deming regression line revealed a strong

187

correlation with a slope of 1.01 and an intercept of -0.4.

DISCUSSION

189

In this study, two very different assays were compared: the RealStar assay used with various

190

extraction equipment, allowing a use in a wide range of PCR laboratories, and the Cobas 6800

191

kit used with the fully automated Cobas 6800 platform, allowing more intensive workflows.

192

As all other SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostic tests, both assays are qualitative but yield a Ct

193

value inversely proportional to the amount of virus. In our work, below a Cobas 6800 Ct

194

value of 35, the qualitative results are highly concordant and the Ct values have a high

195

correlation even though the values of RealStar are lower than those of the Cobas 6800. Above

196

a Cobas 6800 value Ct of 35, the RealStar failed to detect about one third of the SARS-CoV-2

197

genes while COBAS 6800 detected at least one of both targets. However, this observation is

198

impacted by the extraction method in use, as demonstrated by the slightly lower Ct values and

199

higher positivity rate observed with the MagNA Pure system among samples showing E gene

200

Ct >35 with the COBAS 6800. This suggests a better extraction process with the MagNA

201

Pure system. The comparison, from same samples, between EasyMag and QIAsymphony

202

systems showed a slight improvement for the SARS-CoV-2 detection with QIAsymphony.

203

Among samples with Ct values above 35, the E target is mostly the only gene detected with

204

the Cobas 6800 assay. This is in accordance with the Cobas 6800 insert information reporting

205

a higher sensitivity for the E gene detection than for the ORF1/a, and also a drop in the

206

positivity rate above 35 Ct for the E target. This may explain why the RealStar test yielded

207

many negative results in such cases as both tests probably reached their detection limits. This

208

is a limitation of our study as we did not assessed comparatively the limit of detection of the

209

two methods but the reliability of their Ct values among COBAS 6800 positive samples,

210

excluding those that could be negative with COBAS 6800 and positive with RealStar in this

211

range of low viral loads. Our work highlights the impact of the extraction system on the

212

sensitivity of the RealStar assay.

213
214

Overall, we demonstrated the good performances and concordance between the two assays, at

215

least for viral loads above the detection limit of both assays. This concordance allows to

216

reliably compare Ct values obtained from both methods. However, the variations observed

217

between the Ct values of the two assays, evaluated here as about 3.5 additional Ct with the

218

Cobas 6800 assay, has to be taken into account for Ct values follow-up done for the most

219

severe patients in case of successive use of the two methods, depending of reagent and

220

analyser availability.
