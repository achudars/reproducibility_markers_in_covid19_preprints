SUMMARY
Acute lung immunity to inhaled pathogens elicits defensive pneumonitis that may convert to the
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), causing high mortality. Mechanisms underlying the
conversion are not understood, but are of intense interest because of the ARDS-induced mortality
in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Here, by optical imaging of live lungs we show that key to the
lethality is the functional status of mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering across the mitochondrial Ca2+
uniporter (MCU) in the lung’s alveolar type 2 cells (AT2), which protect alveolar stability. In mice
subjected to ARDS by airway exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or to Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
there was marked loss of MCU expression in AT2. The ability of mice to survive ARDS depended
on the extent to which the MCU expression recovered, indicating that the viability of Ca2+ buffering
by AT2 mitochondria critically determines ARDS severity. Mitochondrial transfer to enhance AT2
MCU expression might protect against ARDS.

INTRODUCTION
The acute immune response at environment-facing epithelial barriers provides rapid systemic protection
against ambient pathogens. The lung, which is particularly prone to challenge by inhaled pathogens,
develops brisk immunity to clear the pathogens and protect barrier properties of the alveolar epithelium,
the site of blood oxygenation. Pneumonia due to non-resolving inflammation causes barrier injury and
pulmonary edema, impairing oxygenation, and setting the stage for the Acute Respiratory Distress
Syndrome (ARDS), a condition associated with high mortality (Bellani et al., 2016). Mechanistic
understanding is lacking as to how benign pneumonias lead to life-threatening ARDS.
The mortality risk in pneumonia is due not only to the infectious load of the inhaled organism, but also to
the injurious host response that involves failure of the alveolar epithelial fluid barrier, which causes the
characteristic pulmonary edema of ARDS (Bhattacharya and Matthay, 2013). The epithelium consists of
structural type 1 cells that form the alveolar wall, and the metabolically significant type 2 cells (hereafter,
AT2). AT2 are particularly important for barrier maintenance, since they secrete surfactant that stabilizes
alveolar patency and protect against pulmonary edema (Mora et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2020). However,
immunity-induced mechanisms that impair the secretion are not well understood.
AT2 mitochondria are important in this regard, since they provide ATP to support surfactant secretion
(Islam et al., 2014). Although not shown directly for AT2, mitochondrial calcium (mCa2+) buffering
modulates the cytosolic Ca2+ (cCa2+), unchecked increases in which cause barrier weakening (Hough et
al., 2019). Indirect support for a mitochondrial role in lung immune injury comes from findings that
replenishment of the immune-challenged alveolar epithelium with exogenous mitochondria protects
against lung injury (Islam et al., 2012). However, the role of mitochondrial buffering in this protection
remains unclear.
Mitochondrial buffering involves Ca2+ flux from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix across the
mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) (Baughman et al., 2011; De Stefani et al., 2011). The flux is
regulated by MCU-associated proteins (Kamer and Mootha, 2015), as well as by oxidative (Dong et al.,
2017) and transcriptional (Favaro et al., 2019; Shanmughapriya et al., 2015) mechanisms. Studies in
mice involving global (Pan et al., 2013) or tissue-specific MCU deletion (Kwong et al., 2015), or
overexpression of dominant-negative MCU (Rasmussen et al., 2015) reveal a determining role of the
MCU in multiple aspects of organ function, inlcuding body size determination (Pan et al., 2013), exercise
tolerance (Gherardi et al., 2019; Kwong et al., 2018; Pan et al., 2013), myocardieal infarction (Kwong et
al., 2015; Luongo et al., 2015), pulmonary fibrosis (Gu et al., 2019), insulin secretion (Georgiadou et al.,
2020), fibroblast differentiation (Lombardi et al., 2019), and hepatic lipidosis (Tomar et al., 2019).
Despite this extensive evidence for MCU involvement in organ function, the reported data rely on a priori
genetic modifications that do not replicate natural pathogenesis. Understanding is therefore lacking as to
whether disease processes modify the MCU to exacerbate pathophysiology.
Here, we address this issue in LPS and bacterial models of lung infection, using a novel in situ assay of
mitochondrial buffering in AT2 of live alveoli by means of real-time confocal microscopy (Islam et al.,
2012). We could thereby, determine the first dynamic Ca2+ responses in the cytosol and mitochondria in
relation to the progression of acute immunity. Our findings indicate that by the first post-infection day,
there was marked depletion of both message and protein levels of AT2 MCU, together with loss of
buffering. Unexpectedly, sustained MCU depletion promoted mortality, which could be mitigated by
MCU repletion, revealing for the first time the critical role of AT2 MCU in immune alveolar injury.

RESULTS
The MCU and alveolar homeostasis
For in situ assay of MCU function in AT2, we quantified mitochondrial buffering and its effect on
surfactant secretion. We identified AT2 as cells that stained for surfactant-containing lamellar bodies
(LBs) and for surfactant protein B (Figure S1A) ((Islam et al., 2014). By live confocal microscopy in
conjunction with alveolar microinfusion, we loaded the alveolar epithelium with the dyes, rhod2 and
fluo4 to quantify mCa2+ and cCa2+, respectively. To confirm compartmental distribution of the dyes, we
gave alveolar microinfusion of a mild detergent, which released fluo4, but not rhod2 from the epithelium,
affirming that fluo4 was localized to the cytosol and rhod2 to the mitochondrial matrix (Ichimura et al.,
2003) (Figure S1B,C). Alveolar stretch due to a 15-second lung hyperinflation induced transient cCa2+
oscillations in AT2, but no increase of mean cCa2+ (Figure 1A,B). Concomitantly, both the mean and the
oscillation amplitude of mitochondrial Ca2+ (mCa2+) increased (Figure 1A,B and Supplemental video 1).
These responses affirmed that the mitochondrial buffering in AT2 protected against increases of the mean
cCa2+.
We tested these responses in MCUF/F:SPC-cre mice (AEMCU-) in which we induced by pre-partum cre
recombination in the alveolar epithelium (AE) (Perl et al., 2002; Westphalen et al., 2014) (Figure S1D).
We evaluated MCU function in AT2, since mitochondrial function in these cells determines surfactant
secretion (Islam et al., 2012). The stretch-induced mitochondrial responses were inhibited
pharmacologically by alveolar treatment with the MCU blocker, ruthenium red and they were absent in
AEMCU- mice (Figures S1E and 1B), confirming the MCU role in the buffering. Further, loss of buffering
caused the expected increase of mean cCa2+ (Figure 1B). The inhibitor of store Ca2+ release,
xestospongin C blocked the all Ca2+ increases (Figure S1E), consistent with the notion that MCUdependent mCa2+ increases were due to mitochondrial entry of store-released Ca2+. Surfactant secretion
in intact alveoli is assayed by labeling LBs in AT2, then detecting the time-dependent loss of the
fluorescence to a secretion stimulus such as alveolar stretch (Islam et al., 2012; Islam et al., 2014)
(Figures S1F-H and 1C). However, this response was absent in AEMCU- mice (Figure 1C), as also in mice
treated with ruthenium red, indicating that blocking mitochondrial Ca2+ entry blocked surfactant secretion
(Figure S1G,H). These findings indicated that the AT2 MCU is a major determinant of surfactant
secretion, hence of alveolar homeostasis.
Lung immunity causes MCU loss
Since it is not known whether the acute immune response modifies MCU expression, we determined time
dependent responses of AT2 mitochondria in the LPS model of pneumonitis at different doses of
intranasal LPS instillation (Islam et al., 2012; Westphalen et al., 2014). LPS doses for different mouse
strains are described in Table 2. An intranasal sub-lethal dose of LPS caused marked increase of
leukocyte counts in the bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) within Day 1 (Figure S2A). This brisk immune
response recovered to baseline by Day 3 (Figure S2A). Alveolar homeostasis was destabilized on Day1
as indicated by abrogation of surfactant secretion, and increase of extravascular lung water, a measure of
pulmonary edema (Figure S2B). Thus, the LPS-induced alveolar injury was transient, providing an
opportunity to evaluate early and late mitochondrial responses.
In lungs derived from these LPS-treated mice, the AT2 physiological responses, namely mCa2+ increase
and surfactant secretion, were present at 4h post-LPS, but not at 24h (Figure 2A,B), indicating that a
single instillation of LPS deteriorated alveolar mitochondrial buffering by Day 1. To rule out the
possibility that alveolar inflammation may have interfered with alveolar expansion, thereby nonspecifically blocking stretch-induced effects, we applied an optogenetic approach to increase cCa2+ (Lin

et al., 2009). We expressed the light sensitive, cation channel, channelrhodhopsin-2 (ChR2) in the
alveolar epithelium (Figure S2C). Excitation of ChR2 by blue light increased AT2 mitochondrial Ca2+ in
PBS-, but not in LPS-treated lungs (Figures S2D,E and 2C). Hence, the stretch and optogenetics
approaches together denoted loss of MCU-induced buffering in AT2 following LPS treatment.
To determine whether the loss of buffering reflected changes in MCU expression, we carried out
immunoblots on mitochondria isolated from extracted AT2. MCU protein levels were unchanged from
baseline for upto 8h post-LPS. Subsequently, the expression progressively decreased to 25% of baseline
by 16h and was undetectable by 24h (Figure 2D). Further, as compared with corresponding PBS lungs,
MCU RNA was higher in lungs extracted 4h after LPS, than in those extracted at 24h (Figure 2E).
However, despite the MCU loss at Day 1 post-LPS, the mitochondrial outer membrane proteins, TOM-20
and VDAC, and the matrix protein HSP60 were well expressed (Figure S2F,G). The proteins of the
mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) were also well expressed and their activities were not
diminished (except for a small decrease in Complex II activity) (Figure S2H,I). Therefore, the MCU loss
was not due to a non-specific loss of mitochondrial proteins.
The mitochondrial membrane potential informs mitochondrial fitness. Mitochondrial depolarization
stabilizes PINK1 on the outer membrane. PINK1 recruits the E3-ubiquitin ligase, parkin, which initiates
mitophagy (Matsuda et al., 2010). To determine whether the MCU impacted mitochondrial potential, we
loaded the alveolar epithelium with the potentiometric dye, TMRE, fluorescence of which decreases with
mitochondrial depolarization (Hough et al., 2019; Ichimura et al., 2003). Our findings indicate that
despite the loss of the MCU, TMRE fluorescence was unchanged (Figure S2J,K), indicating that the AT2
mitochondria were not depolarized, hence they were unlikely to be mitophagy targets of the PINK1parkin mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we carried out immunoblots on mitochondria derived from
AT2 24h after LPS treatment. These studies failed to reveal association of parkin (Figure S2L),
suggesting that the MCU loss did not induce a mitophagy signal.
To evaluate the effect of inflammation severity, we exposed mice to intranasal LPS at sublethal or lethal
doses (Table 2) (Islam et al., 2012). For the sublethal dose, the MCU loss on Day1 was followed by
recovery of MCU expression (Figure 2F). By contrast, for the lethal dose the expression did not recover
(Figure 2F). Similarly, although both doses caused loss of body weight by Day 1, the weight recovered
for the sublethal, but not the lethal dose (Figure 2G). These findings suggested that adequacy of AT2
MCU expression was a determinant of survival. To further evaluate this question, we instilled LPS in
AEMCU- mice. Unexpectedly, mortality was markedly higher in AEMCU- mice than in littermate floxed
controls (Figure 2H), indicating that loss of MCU function in AT2 mitochondria was of systemic
significance. Taking our findings together, we interpret that loss of buffering due to MCU depletion in
AT2 resulted in failed surfactant secretion, the systemic consequence of which was increased mortality.
Since the effects of purified LPS might not be entirely representative of those induced by Gram-negative
bacteria, we infected lungs by intranasal instillation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) at a high and a low
dose to induce dose dependent increases of leukocyte counts in the bronchioalveolar lavage by Day 1
(Figure S2M). Concomitantly, the loss of AT2 MCU expression was also dose dependent (Figure 2I).
These findings indicated that the lung’s immune response caused a dose dependent loss of AT2 MCU
expression.
LPS-induced mitochondrial H2O2 degrades MCU of AT2 mitochondria
To determine the role of mitochondrial H2O2 production in these responses (Carneiro et al., 2018; Ip et
al., 2017), we expressed the matrix-targeted, H2O2 sensor roGFP (Waypa et al., 2010). Transfection of
roGFP by intranasal delivery of liposomal plasmid avoids potential difficulties due to mitochondrial

uptake of diffusible H2O2 sensing dyes (Polster et al., 2014). Intranasal LPS instillation progressively
increased H2O2 in AT2 mitochondria (Figures S3A and 3A). To block this response, we expressed
catalase in AT2 mitochondria by crossing inducible SPC-Cre mice with mice expressing mitochondriatargeted human catalase downstream of a floxed STOP codon (Schriner et al., 2005). Post-partum
induction of SPC-Cre caused catalase expression in AT2 mitochondria of these mice (AT2CAT), as
confirmed by alveolar immunofluorescence and immunoblot (Figure S3B,C). LPS treatment of AT2CAT
mice failed to increase mitochondrial H2O2, or induce loss of AT2 MCU (Figure 3B,C). Accordingly,
MCU function was retained (Figure 3D,E), alveolar inflammation was mitigated (Figure 3F), and
mortality was reduced (Figure 3G). Mice pre-treated with the mitochondria-specific anti-oxidant, MitoQ
were also protected from the MCU loss (Figures S3D), indicating efficacy of pharmacalogic intervention.
Together, these findings indicated that LPS-induced increase in AT2 mitochondrial H2O2 was a critical
mediator of the MCU loss.
We considered the possibility that mitochondrial H2O2 might induce mitochondrial fragmentation, and
thereby impair mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake (Wang et al., 2017). Mitochondrial H2O2 can activate the
fragmentation inducer, dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1) (Gomes and Scorrano, 2013; Preau et al., 2016).
Since mitochondrial distribution has not been determined in intact systems, we imaged AT2 in intact
alveoli of PhAM floxed:E2a-Cre mice that globally express the mitochondria-targeted fluorescent protein,
Dendra-2 (Luchsinger et al., 2016) (Figures S4A and 4A). AT2 mitochondria aggregated at peri-nuclear
poles, co-existing with surfactant-containing lamellar bodies. However, this polarized aggregation was
lost by Day 1 after LPS, as fragmented mitochondria distributed throughout the cytosol (Figure 4A,B).
However, following intranasal delivery of the Drp1 inhibitor, Mdivi-1 (Manczak et al., 2019), LPS failed
to disrupt the polarized mitochondrial distribution (Figure 4A,B). Thus, Drp1 inhibition blocked LPSinduced mitochondrial disaggregation.
We confirmed that Drp1 was activated, as revealed by Drp1 phosphorylation at Ser-616 through
immunoblots of AT2 mitochondria with a specific antibody (Simula et al., 2018) (Figure 4C).
Immunoblots also revealed Drp1 localization to mitochondria in floxed littermate controls, but not in
AT2CAT mice (Figure 4D). Thus Drp1 activation was H2O2 dependent. To evaluate this mechanism
further, we induced AT2-specific Drp1 deletion through post-partum cre recombination in Drp1F/F:SPCcre mice (AT2Drp1-). We confirmed the deletion by immunoblot of isolated AT2 (Figure S4B). In AT2Drpmice, there was no LPS-induced MCU loss (Figure 5A). The MCU loss was also inhibited in mice with
AT2 expression of a Drp1 mutant that lacks GTPase activity (Cereghetti et al., 2010; Smirnova et al.,
2001) (Figure 5B), or after pre-treatment with Mdivi-1 (Figure S4C). These findings indicated that
Drp1activation caused the MCU loss.
Since MCU loss inhibited surfactant secretion, we evaluated the secretion in LPS-treated AT2Drp1- mice.
Since MCU was not lost in these mice, surfactant secretion was robust (Figure 5C). Since H2O2
production was upsteam of the Drp1 activation, the LPS-induced H2O2 increase was present in AT2Drp1mice (Figure 5D). Thus, we show that LPS exposure induced a chain of events in AT2 mitochondria, in
which H2O2-induced Drp1 activation caused mitochondrial fragmentation and loss of MCU. The
resulting impairment of surfactant secretion likely contributed to the dysfunctional lung fluid balance
underlying ARDS.
Factors contributing to mitochondrial responses in AT2
In LPS-treated lungs episodic AT2 cCa2+ increases occur because of Ca2+ conduction through connexin
43 (Cx43)-containing gap junctions (GJs) in the alveolar epithelium (AE) (Ashino et al., 2000; Ichimura
et al., 2006). Cx43F/F:SPC-cre mice lack Cx43 in the AT2 (AT2Cx43-) (Figure S5A). As opposed to floxed

littermate controls, in AT2Cx43- mice LPS failed to decrease MCU (Figure 6A) and mitochondrial
buffering was robust (Figure 6B). These findings indicated that the presence of AE GJs supported the
MCU loss.
It is proposed that LPS-induced activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR4) translocates the TLR-signaling
adaptor molecule, TRAF6 to mitochondria (Kopp et al., 1999). TRAF6 forms a complex with Complex I
assembly factor, ECSIT (evolutionarily conserved signaling intermediate in Toll pathways), augmenting
mitochondrial H2O2 formation (West et al., 2011). We tested this possibility in mice with heterozygous
knockout of ECSIT (ECSIT+/-) in which ECSIT expression is 50% of wild type (West et al., 2011). In
ECSIT+/- mice, the LPS-induced MCU loss was markedly mitigated (Figure 6C). Taken together, our
findings indicate that Cx43-containing AT2 GJs and mitochondrial ECSIT contributed to the MCU loss.
Rescue of AT2 MCU protects against LPS-induced mortality
To further evaluate the MCU role, we replenished MCU in in mice globally lacking the MCU (MCU-/-)
through intranasal instillation of a lentiviral vector for MCU transduction (Pan et al., 2013). The viral
transduction increased MCU expression in AT2 (Figure S6A,B). Although LPS-induced mortality in
MCU-/- mice was two times above control (Figure 7A), MCU transduction markedly abrogated the
mortality (Figure 7A), affirming the protective effect of the MCU replenishment.
To determine the effects of MCU overexpression in wild-type mice, we instilled liposome-complexed
MCU plasmid, then confirmed that 48h after transfection, AT2 MCU expression was two times above
baseline (Figure S6C,D). Subsequently, as expected from our findings above, LPS decreased the MCU
expression in LPS-24 lungs (Figure 7B). However, despite this decrease, the expression remained
sufficiently high (60% of baseline) that buffering was retained (Figure 7B,C). Although LPS caused the
expected decrease of ATP in controls (Islam et al., 2012), MCU-transfection protected ATP production
(Figure 7D), surfactant secretion (Figure 7E), and survival (Figure 7F). Together, these studies indicated
that in LPS-induced ARDS, MCU overexpression ensured adequate protection of AT2 MCU function,
thereby protecting survival.
As a possible therapeutic approach for enriching AT2 MCU in ARDS, we considered a mitochondrial
transfer strategy. Mitochondrial transfer from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs)
to the alveolar epithelium protects against ARDS (Islam et al., 2012). However, the protective
mechanisms are not understood. To determine the role of the AT2 MCU in this protection, we transfected
BMSCs with plasmids encoding GFP-tagged, wild-type MCU (MCUwt) (Figure S7A), or a mutant MCU
(MCUmt) that inhibits mitochondrial Ca2+ entry (Raffaello et al., 2013) (Figure S7B). We intranasally
instilled BMSCs expressing the MCU plasmids 4h after instilling LPS. In LPS-24 lungs of these mice,
we confirmed that BMSC mitochondria were transferred to AT2 (Figure S7C,D), and that the transfer
increased MCU expression in AT2 (Figure 8A). Overexpression of MCUwt protected MCU function and
abrogated inflammation, increasing survival (Figure 8B-E). Overexpression of MCUmt failed to achieve
the protections. Taking our findings together, we conclude that primary lack of the AT2 MCU was
sufficient to tilt the inflammatory outcome towards ARDS, and that rescue of MCU function by
mitochondrial transfer protected inflammation resolution and survival.

DISCUSSION
We report here our finding that viability of MCU function in the alveolar epithelium determines ARDS
severity. Direct evidence of this was obtained by genetic deletion studies, showing that tissue-specific
knockout of the MCU in the alveolar epithelium markedly exacerbated LPS-induced mortality. The MCU

loss in the alveolar epithelium occurred as part of the innate immune response, since exposing mice to a
sub-lethal LPS dose, or to P, aeruginosa progressively decreased the MCU expression. Importantly,
survival depended on spontaneous or experimental replenishment of the MCU expression. MCU
reinstatement restored mitochondrial buffering in AT2, re-establishing surfactant secretion, mitigating
inflammation and abrogating mortality. Thus, alveolar MCU was revealed to be critical for survival
during immune stress.
Treating mice with a sub-lethal LPS dose enabled recognition of mitochondrial responses in a timedependent manner. The time course of the MCU expression was unchanged from baseline for about 8h
post-LPS. Subsequently however, the expression progressively decreased until it was undetectable by
Day 1. These time courses tallied with indices of MCU function, which were intact early after LPS
exposure, despite the onset of a robust immune response. Notably however, both MCU expression and
MCU function failed by Day 1. Concomitantly, mitochondrial H2O2 production progressively increased.
Expression of AT2-specific catalase blocked the MCU loss, implicating mitochondrial H2O2 as a
determinant of MCU expression.
Increase of mitochondrial H2O2 in AT2 can occur as a result of Complex 1 instability induced by binding
of TRAF6 to ECSIT (Kopp et al., 1999; West et al., 2011), or by Ca2+ communication across Cx43containing GJs in the AE (Ashino et al., 2000; Ichimura et al., 2003). We affirmed these mechanisms, in
that heterozygous ECSIT knockout, or AT2-specific Cx43 knockout each markedly abrogated the LPSinduced MCU loss. These mechanisms may have operated in tandem, the cCa2+-induced effect operating
in the early phase of the immune response when mitochondrial buffering was present. In the later phase,
as buffering failed, the ECSIT-induced effect may have dominated. Together, these mechanisms may
have established the MCU-degrading, sustained H2O2 increase.
The H2O2 production activated Drp1, an effect that was inhibited by expression of mitochondrial catalase.
Importantly, MCU loss was blocked in mice lacking Drp1 in AT2. Taking these findings together, we
conclude that H2O2-activation of Drp1 was the critical mechanism underlying the LPS-induced MCU
loss. We speculate that during immune challenge, the cell decreases MCU expression as negative
feedback against further mCa2+-induced oxidant production.
Drp1 activation, resulting from exposure to viruses, bacteria and other inflammogens (Cui et al., 2018;
Jain et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2014; Park et al., 2018) is implicated in the mitochondrial fragmentation that
precedes mitophagy, a process by which the cell eliminates dysfunctional mitochondria (Gomes and
Scorrano, 2013). Here, LPS caused mitochondrial fragmentation as indicated by a loss of their polarized
aggregated formations, and to absence of fusion-fission activity. However, contents of several proteins of
the mitochondrial inner and outer membranes, as well as the mitochondrial membrane potential, a
measure of mitochondrial fitness, were unchanged. Further, parkin localization to mitochondria, a marker
of mitophagy initiation (Cereghetti et al., 2010; Matsuda et al., 2010), was undetectable. Hence, we
interpret that the fragmentation did not cause loss of AT2 mitochondria, and that the LPS-induced MCU
loss was not due to Drp1-activated mitophagy of AT2. In unstressed lungs, AT2 mitochondria clustered
with LBs, suggesting that the close LB-mitochondria proximity facilitated transfer of mitochondrial ATP
to LBs to activate surfactant secretion. Diminished ATP transfer following mitochondrial disaggregation
might account for inhibition of LPS-induced inhibition of surfactant secretion.
In conclusion, our findings attest to the critical role played by the AT2 MCU in protecting mitochondrial
buffering for the maintenance of alveolar stability. Evidently, the unprotected cCa2+ increases that
occurred in the buffering-compromised alveolar epithelium, accounted for two major injury mechanisms.
First, there was compromise of the epithelial fluid barrier, as evident in the increases of the extravascular

lung water content. The barrier loss might be have been due cCa2+-induced actin depolymerization,
(Hough et al., 2019). Second, MCU deficiency inhibited mCa2+-induced ATP increases required for
surfactant secretion. These injury mechanisms likely induced the pulmonary edema that exacerbated
mortality. We propose that restoration of AT2 MCU function by mitochondrial replenishment therapy
might provide a strategy for the prevention and reversal of ARDS.

CONTACT FOR REAGENTS AND RESOURCE SHARING
Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by
the Lead Contact, Dr. Jahar Bhattacharya (jb39@cumc.columbia.edu). MTAs were obtained for the
transfer of MCUF/F, MCU-/-, mCATF/F, Drp1F/F and SPC-Cre mice.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Animal methods. Animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. All animals were cared for
according to the NIH guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Mice were socially housed
under a 12h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and food. Age and sex matched animals were
randomly assigned to experimental groups by investigators. Investigators were blinded for the all survival
and BAL leukocyte count studies.
Bacterial culture. We cultured single colonies of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (strain K, provided by A.
Prince, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA), overnight in 4 ml of Luria–Bertani (LB) medium at
37oC and 250 rpm (Innova42, New Brunswick Scientific). P. aeruginosa were selected with
Carbenicillin (300 µg/ml). On the day of the experiment, overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 in fresh
LB and grown in a shaking incubator to optical density (OD) 0.5 at 600 nm (SPECTRAmax Plus,
Molecular Devices).
In vivo bacterial instillation. For intranasal instillations in mice, 1 ml bacterial culture was centrifuged
and resuspended in 10 ml sterile PBS. In anesthetized (ketamine-100 mg/kg and xylazine 5 mg/kg, i.p.)
animals, we airway instilled 50 µl suspension to deliver “high” inoculum (1 x 106 CFU) per mouse. For
“low” inoculum instillation, we diluted (x10) the “high” inoculum suspension, then airway instilled 50 µl
suspension to deliver 1 x 105 CFU per mouse.
Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) methods. ARDS was induced in anesthetized (ketamine100 mg/kg and xylazine 5 mg/kg, i.p.) animals by airway instillation of LPS (E.coli 0111.B4) in sterile
PBS. Control animals were instilled an equal volume of sterile PBS. Since multiple mouse strains were
used, and since the lung injury-causing LPS dose varies between mouse strains, we gave different LPS
doses to simulate sublethal, moderate and lethal ARDS-inducing that caused mortality of 0, 30 and 80%,
respectively, in control groups (Table 2). The strains are indicated.

Bone marrow-derived stromal cell (BMSC) isolation, purification and culture. We isolated mouse
BMSCs according to our reported methods (Islam et al., 2012). Briefly, in anesthetized animals, bone
lumens of excised femurs and tibia were infused with MSC growth medium to recover marrow. Three
days after marrow plating on tissue culture flasks, the supernatant was rejected and adherent BMSCs were
incubated (37oC) under subconfluent conditions to prevent cell differentiation. BMSCs from passages 5
to 12 were used in this study. In accordance with established criteria (Dominici et al., 2006), BMSCs
were characterized as we reported (Islam et al., 2012). BMSCs were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37°C in
DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% of an antibiotic mixture.

METHOD DETAILS
Isolated, blood-perfused lungs. Using our reported methods (Islam et al., 2012; Westphalen et al., 2014),
lungs were excised from anesthetized mice (i.p., Ketamine 80-100 mg/kg, Xylazine 1-5 mg/kg), then
perfused with autologous blood through cannulas in the pulmonary artery and left atrium. The blood was
diluted in 4% dextran (70 kDa), 1% fetal bovine serum and buffer (150 mmol/l Na+, 5 mmol/l K+, 1.0
mmol/l Ca2+, 1 mmol/l Mg2+, and 20 mmol/l HEPES at pH 7.4). The perfusion flow rate was 0.5 ml/min
at 37°C at osmolarity of 300 mosM (Fiske Micro-Osmometer, Fiske® Associates, Norwood, MA), and
hematocrit 10%. The lung was inflated through a tracheal cannula with a gas mixture (30% O2, 6% CO2,
balance N2). Vascular (artery and vein at 10 and 3 cmH2O) and airway (5 cmH2O) pressures were held
constant during microscopy.
Alveolar microinfusion and imaging. To load the alveolar epithelium with fluorescent dyes or antibodies,
we micropunctured single alveoli with glass micropipettes (tip diameter 3-5 µm) and microinfused ~10
neighboring alveoli (Lindert et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2001). After the microinfusions, the free liquid in
the alveolar lumen drained in seconds re-establishing air-filled alveoli (Wang et al., 2001). This rapid
clearance indicates that the micropuncture does not rupture the alveolar wall, and that the micropunctured
membrane rapidly reseals as reported for other cells (Steinhardt et al., 1994). Nevertheless, we selected
non-micropunctured alveoli for imaging. To determine whether the fluorescence detected in the
epithelium was intracellular or extracellular, in some experiments we microinfused alveoli for 10 minutes
with trypan blue (0.01% w/v), which eliminates extracellular fluorescence (Rowlands et al., 2011). In all
experiments in which we infused multiple dyes, we confirmed absence of bleed-through between
fluorescence emission channels. We imaged intact alveoli of live lungs with laser scanning microscopy
(LSM 510 META, Zeiss and TCS SP8, Leica)
Alveolar immunofluorescence. We used our reported methods to detect intracellular immunofluorescence
in live alveoli (Islam et al., 2014; Westphalen et al., 2014). Briefly, we gave alveoli successive 20-minute
microinfusions of 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% triton X-100. Then, we microinfused fluorescenceconjugated antibodies (40 ng/ml) for 10 minutes. In some experiments, microinfusion of antibodies were
followed by microinfusion of fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies (40 ng/ml). To washout
20

unbound fluorescence, we microinfused buffer for 10 minutes and commenced imaging after a further 10
minutes.
AT2 isolation by flow cytometry. We isolated AT2 by our reported methods (Islam et al., 2012). Briefly,
isolated lungs were buffer perfused through vascular cannulas to clear blood, then we exposed the lungs
to intratracheal dispase (0.2 U/ml, 2ml, 45 minutes) at room temperature. The tissue was suspended in
PBS and sieved and the sieved sample was then centrifuged (300g x 5 min). The pellet was resuspended
and incubated together with the AT2 localizing dye, lysotracker red (LTR) (Ashino et al., 2000), the
nuclear dye, Hoechst 33342 and fluorescence Allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated Ab against the
leukocyte antigen, CD45. The suspension was then subjected to cell sorting (Influx cell sorter) to recover
AT2.
Mitochondria isolation. We used a commercially available isolation kit (Rowlands et al., 2011) (Thermo
Scientific). Briefly, we homogenized lungs and AT2 (Tissue Tearor; Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK),
on ice with buffers provided in the kit. The buffers were supplemented with protease and phosphatase
inhibitors. We centrifuged the homogenate (800g x 10 min) and collected the supernatants, which were
further centrifuged at 17000g for 15 min at 4oC. The pellets and the supernatants contained respectively,
the mitochondrial and the cytosolic fractions. Purity of cell fractionation was determined by
immunoblotting for voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) in mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions.
Immunoblotting/Immunoprecipitation. For immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, mitochondrial
fractions were lysed in 2% SDS. For immunoprecipitation, lysates containing 2 mg total protein were
precleared with appropriate control IgG for 30 minutes at 4°C with 20 µl of prewashed protein A/G and
processed as previously described (Islam et al., 2012). Equal amounts (100 µg) of protein from lysates
were separated by SDS-PAGE, electro-transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane overnight at 4°C and
blocked in Starting Block Blocking Buffer (Pierce) for 1h then subjected to immunoblotting.
Densitometry was performed using ImageJ software.
RNA determination. RNA was extracted from isolated AT2 using the RNeasy Micro Kit. The purity of
the RNA was assessed by absorbance at 260 and 280 nm using a Thermo Scientific NanoDrop
spectrophotometer. Using RNA with a 260/280 ratio of > 1.8, cDNA was synthesized using oligo (dT)
and Superscript II. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using a 7500 Real-Time PCR system (Applied
Biosystems) and SYBR Green Master Mix.
siRNA and plasmid transfection in mice. We purchased siRNA against MCU and RISP. For knockdown
experiments, we intranasally instilled mice with 50µg siRNA complexed with freshly extruded liposomes
as previously described (Rowlands et al., 2011; Westphalen et al., 2014). Stock solutions of plasmids
(2.5 µg/µl) were similarly complexed with freshly extruded unilamellar liposomes (20 µg/µl, 100 nm pore
size) in sterile PBS to a final concentration of 1µg oligonucleotide/µl. Mice were intranasally instilled
(50-75 µl) the nucleic acid-liposome mixture. Lungs from transfected animals were excised 48h later.
Protein expression or knockdown was confirmed by immunoblotting.
Lentivirus cloning and production. From the pMCUwt plasmid, we PCR amplified the cmv-MCU-GFP
sequence with following primers: 5’-TACGTAACCATGGCGGCCGCCGCAGGTAG-3’ and 5’TCATTCCTTTTCTCCGATCTGTCGGAGGCTCGAG-3'. Thus, we introduced Snabl and Xhol
restriction sites introduced in them. We used the PCR product for TA cloning. From the TA clone, the
cmv-MCU-GFP sequence was excised using Snabl and Xhol. After the restriction digest, the excised
sequence was ligated with the pGipz vector. The resulting clone was confirmed by restriction digest and
sequencing. To make the virus, the lentiviral plasmid was co-transfected with envelop (pMD2.G) and
packaging (pCMV-dR8.9) plasmids. Viral supernatants were harvested 48h after transfection, centrifuged,
21

and filtered through a 0.45-mm filter (Millipore). Viral particles were pelleted at 50,000g x 2h at 4oC,
resuspended in DMEM, aliquoted, and stored at -80oC. Viral titers were determined by Lenti-X qRT-PCR
Titration Kit. Anesthetized animals were intranasally administered with 100µl viral suspension with a
titer of 1x107 pfu. Lungs were excised 21d after infection and MCU expression confirmed by
immunoblotting and alveolar imaging.
Channelrhodopsin activation. To activate ChR2 in the alveolar epithelium, imaged alveolar fields were
excited by mercury lamp illumination directed through an FITC (470±10 nm) filter. The duration of field
excitation was 10-seconds.
Mitochondrial complex activity assay. We used a reported method to determine complex I-IV activities
(Rera et al., 2011). Briefly, purified mitochondria were resuspended in complexes I-IV activity assay
buffers. Activity of complexes I and II were measured as the rate of decrease in absorbance at 600nm.
Whereas, activity of complexes III and IV were measured respectively, as the rate of increase and
decrease in absorbance at 550nm. For each assay, absorbance was measured at the given wavelength
every 10 sec for 30 min at 25°C using a SpectraMax microplate spectrophotometer. Enzymatic activities
were normalized to protein concentrations. Complex I activity was calculated as the difference between
activities measured when samples were incubated with 2µM Rotenone or ethanol.
Extravascular lung water. We determined blood-free lung water content by our reported method
(Bhattacharya et al., 1989; Safdar et al., 2003). Briefly, we determined the wet and dry weights of excised
lungs and quantified hemoglobin concentrations in lung homogenates to correct for blood water content in
the wet/dry ratio.
Lung ATP determination. We used our reported colorimetric methods for lung ATP determination (Islam
et al., 2012).
Bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophil count. Exsanguinated animals were tracheally cannulated.
BAL fluid was obtained by intratracheal instillations with 1 ml ice-cold sterile PBS. The recovered lavage
fluid was centrifuged at 400g x 5 min at 4°C, and the pellet was resuspended in PBS supplemented with
1% BSA. Following erythrolysis, BAL cell numbers were counted using a Neubauer chamber.
Neutrophils in the chamber were identified by fluorescence-tagged Ly-6G antibody.

QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All major groups comprised a minimum of 3 mice each. Mean and SEM were calculated on a per-lung
basis. We analyzed paired comparisons by the paired t-test and multiple comparisons by ANOVA with
Bonferroni’s post-hoc analysis. Survival comparisons were analyzed by the Logrank test. All data are
mean±SE. Significance was accepted at P<0.05.

(A) Confocal images show AT2 in situ at low (i) and high (ii-iv) magnifications for the
indicated region (arrow in i). Alveoli (alv) were stained with the lamellar body localizing dye,
lysotracker red (LTR) and fluorescent surfactant protein B (BODIPY-SPB). Alveolar margins
are delineated by dotted lines. Green and red channel renditions show individual lamellar
bodies stained with SPB and LTR. Scale bars, 30µm (i) and 5µm (ii-iv).
(B) Two-photon image (0.5 µm optical section) shows an alveolar septum with rhod-2 loaded
mitochondria (arrows, orange), fluo-4 loaded cytosol (green) and cell nuclei (white).
(C) Tracings show alveolar microinfusion of saponin selectively decreases the fluorescence of
the cytosolic (fluo-4) but not the mitochondrial dye (rhod-2).
(D) We crossed MCU floxed mice with mice expressing an inducible Cre driven by a
surfactant protect C promoter (SPC-Cre). Pre-partum SPC-Cre induction by doxycycline
caused epithelial MCU deletion in these mice (AEMCU-), as confirmed by MCU immunoblots in
AT2 mitochondria derived from MCUF/F littermates and in alveolar MCU-null (AEMCU-) mice.
Group data are quantification of MCU/VDAC band densities. VDAC, voltage dependent anion
channel. n=3 mice for each bar, *p<0.05 versus MCUF/F.
(E) Data are alveolar Ca2+ responses to alveolar stretch following indicated treatments. By

(A) Confocal image sequence shows changes in mitochondrial matrix-targeted roGFP
(roGFPmatx) fluorescence following indicated alveolar microinfusions. By alveolar
microinfusion, the reducing agent, dithiothreitol (DTT, 2mM) and oxidizing agent, hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2, 100µM) were added to obtain respectively, the maximum (fully reduced) and
minimum (fully oxidized) fluorescence of the expressed probe. As a metric of mitochondrial
H2O2, we determined roGFP oxidation (roGFPox) by the relation: roGFPox = (1- [F/FDTT]),
where F and FDTT are roGFP fluorescence values for the experiment and after exposure to the
reducing agent, DTT.

indicated treatments. Wild-type mice were intranasally instilled for 3 days at 12h intervals with
30 mg/kg of the selective Drp1 inhibitor, Mdivi-1 or vehicle (DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide)
followed 24h later by intranasal instillations of LPS at a sublethal dose. Lungs were excised
and AT2 mitochondria isolated 24h after LPS instillations. n=3 lungs for each bar. *p<0.05
versus corresponding DMSO.

Group data are mean SEM.

(A) We crossed connexin 43 (Cx43) floxed mice (Cx43F/F) with mice expressing an inducible
Cre driven by a surfactant protect C promoter (SPC-Cre). Post-partum SPC-Cre induction by
doxycycline caused AT2 Cx43 deletion in these mice (AT2Cx43-), as confirmed by Cx43
immunoblots in AT2 homogenates derived from mice of indicated genotype..

s-Figure 6. MCU overexpression in intact alveoli
(A and B) Live confocal images (A) and MCU immunoblots (B) show, respectively, alveolar
(alv) fluorescence of the expressed MCU protein (GFP) and MCU protein in AT2 mitochondria
derived from MCU-null (MCU-/-) or MCU-/- with MCU add-back (MCUadd) mice. Epithelial
mitochondria and AT2 were stained respectively, with alveolar microinfusions of mitotracker
deep red (MTDR) and lysotracker red (LTR). Scale bar, 10µm.
(C) Images show alveolar (alv) fluorescence of GFP-pMCUwt overexpression (left) and
immunofluorescence of the expressed GFP (right). To elicit immunofluorescence, anti GFP
mouse Ab tagged with AlexaFluor-633 (anti-GFP-Alexa633) was microinfused into fixed and
permeabilized alveoli. pMCUwt, plasmid encoding for full length MCU. Scale bar, 10µm.
(D) Immunoblots for MCU in AT2 mitochondria derived after intranasal instillations of empty

s-Figure 7. BMSCs expressing pMCUwt protect against LPS inflammation
(A) Live confocal image shows a single bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell
(BMSC) expressing GFP-tagged pMCUwt. pMCUwt, plasmid encoding for full length MCU.
Scale bar, 3 µm.
(B) Tracings from a single experiment and group data show AT2 Ca2+ responses to alveolar
stretch (arrow). Liposome-complexed pMCUmt plasmid (plasmid encoding for a mutant MCU)
was given by intranasal instillation. Lungs were removed 48h after plasmid instillations. EV,
empty vector. n=4 mice per group, *p<0.05 versus EV.
(C) Live confocal image of an LPS-24 lung shows AT2 (LTR, red) and instilled BMSCs
(arrows and arrowhead) expressing GFP-pMCUwt (green). Mice were given intranasal LPS
instillations at a sublethal dose. BMSCs expressing pMCUwt were instilled 4h after LPS
instillation. Lungs were excised and imaged 24h after LPS instillation. White lines represent
alveolar (alv) margin. Scale bar, 15µm.
(D) Magnified images of a single AT2 (arrowhead in C) show in green and red renditions
respectively, fluorescence of BMSC-pMCUwt (green, left) and LTR (red, middle). Scale bar,
5µm.
Group data are mean SEM.

Supplementary Video 1. Alveolar stretch causes mCa2+ entry.
The movie is divided in three segments. In the first segment, image sequences show baseline
fluorescence of a single AT2 (cuboidal cell in the left) in a live alveolus stained with the
mitochondrial Ca2+-sensing dye, rhod-2. The second segment shows dark images
corresponding to the alveolar stretch procedure. The third segment shows mages from the poststretch phase where rhod-2 fluorescence increases denoting increase of mitochondrial Ca2+.
