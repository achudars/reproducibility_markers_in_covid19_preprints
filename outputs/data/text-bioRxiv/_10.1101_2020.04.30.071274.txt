Abstract
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a
widespread outbreak of highly pathogenic COVID-19. It is therefore important and
timely to characterize interactions between the virus and host cell at the molecular level
to understand its disease pathogenesis. To gain insights, we performed high-throughput
sequencing that generated time-series data simultaneously for bioinformatics analysis
of virus genomes and host transcriptomes implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our
analysis results showed that the rapid growth of the virus was accompanied by an early
intensive response of host genes. We also systematically compared the molecular
footprints of the host cells in response to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Upon infection, SARS-CoV-2 induced hundreds of up-regulated host genes hallmarked
by a significant cytokine production followed by virus-specific host antiviral responses.
While the cytokine and antiviral responses triggered by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
were only observed during the late stage of infection, the host antiviral responses during
the SARS-CoV-2 infection were gradually enhanced lagging behind the production of
cytokine. The early rapid host responses were potentially attributed to the high
efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, underscored by evidence of a
remarkably up-regulated gene expression of TPRMSS2 soon after infection. Taken
together, our findings provide novel molecular insights into the mechanisms underlying
the infectivity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) triggered by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently affecting global health. The SARSCoV-2 is the third highly pathogenic coronavirus following SARS-CoV and MERSCoV that cause severe accurate respiratory symptoms in humans. Since December 2019,
this virus has caused more than 80 thousand COVID-19 cases in China. Nowadays, the
number of infections in countries outside China is growing rapidly. The most
remarkable feature of the SARS-CoV-2 incidences and epidemiology is its great
capacity for human-to-human transmission[1]. Clinically, the majority of COVID-19
patients have mild and moderate symptoms, and the elderly appear to have severe
symptoms [2]. Based on the analysis of China data, the COVID-19 case-fatality rate
was estimated as around 4.0% (3,341deaths over 82,249 confirmed cases of SARSCoV-2 infection)[3], lower than those of SARS and MERS[4]. However, due to the
large-scale infected population, the SARS-CoV-2 has already caused more than ninety
thousand deaths as of April 11th 2020, sowing great social panic around the world.
While recent efforts have been focused on transcriptome analysis of host responses to
SARS-CoV-2 infection at a certain time point in certain cell lines[5, 6], the
transcriptional dynamics of host responses to the virus infection has remained largely
unexplored. Generally, once the virus enters the cell, the host innate immune responses,
such as the interferon-mediated antiviral responses and cytokine production, have a
pivotal role in suppressing the virus replication, which, if inadequate, might contribute
to the viral pathogenesis. This hypothesis has been supported by our previous study,

which has shown that the high pathogenicity of avian influenza virus is associated with
abnormal coordination between interferon-mediated antiviral responses and cytokine
production in host cells [7]. Similar to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which induce
the overactivation of cytokines [8], increased cytokine levels are also observed in
patients hospitalized with COVID-19 [9]. Transcriptome analysis of in vitro host cells
shows that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV elicit distinct responses to the expression of
the host genes [10]. Until now, the time-series gene-expression profiling of the host
response to SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown and thus is urgently needed uncovering its
pathogenesis.
In this study, we used the SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated from patients[11] to infect in
vitro Calu-3 cells, and performed RNA sequencing to determine the time-series
transcriptome profiling data of the host. We established the host response patterns for
SARS-CoV-2 by comprehensive analysis of the transcriptomic profiles from SARSCoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. These results provide profound new insights into
the pathogenesis and progression of the COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2,
illuminating new strategies for the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission
and eventually leading to a cure of the COVID-19 disease.

Materials and Methods
Cells and virus. Calu-3 human airway epithelial cells(ATCC, HTB-55) were cultured
in minimum essential media (MEM, HyClone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum(FBS), 1% MEM NEAA, and 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin solution (Gibco,

Grand Island, USA) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% (v/v) CO2. Vero cells
(ATCC, CCL-81) were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM,

Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) in the atmosphere with 5% CO2. SARSCoV-2 strain BetaCoV/Wuhan/IVDC-HB-01/2019 (C-Tan-HB01, GISAID accession
no. EPI_ISL_402119) was isolated from a human patient [11]. Viruses were harvested
and viral titrations were performed in Vero cells using plaque assay.

Calu-3 cell infections and RNA isolation. All experiments involving infectious virus
were performed in approved biosafety level 3 (BSL) laboratories at National Institute
for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, China CDC. Cells were washed with MEM
and inoculated with viruses at an multiplicity of infectious of infection (MOI) of 5 or
mock-diluted in MEM for 2 h at 37°C. Following inoculation, cells were washed 3
times with MEM and fresh medium was added to signify zero hour. Triplicate samples
of mock-infected and virus-infected Calu-3 cells were harvested at different times
between 0 and 24 hour post-infection (hpi). Calu-3 cells were cultured for RNA
isolation using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol.

Library Construction and Sequencing. A total amount of 50 ng RNA per sample was
used as input material for the Total RNA Library Construction and host rRNA removal
according to the instructions of the Trio RNA-Seq kit (Nugen, 0506-32). Total RNA
libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Novaseq using the 2×150bp paired-end read
setting.

Data analysis. Raw reads were filtered to obtain clean data by Trimmomatic (v0.35)
(With parameters ‘ILLUMINACLIP:adapter.fa:2:30:10 HEADCROP:10 LEADING:3
TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:36’)[12]. The cleaned data were
mapped to the human GRCh38 reference genome using STAR aligner (v2.7.2a)[13].
The htseq-count command was used to count reads mapped to each gene [14]. The R
package DESeq2 was applied to further identify Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs)
(FDR<0.05, |log2FC|>=1) [15]. The unmapped reads against the entire human genome
were further aligned to the reference genome of SARS-CoV-2 (EPI_ISL_402119).
Virus genome annotation was based on our previous work[16]. GO enrichment analysis
was performed by Fisher’s exact test with the 19932 human protein-coding genes as a
background in R. For analysis of microarray data of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV,
normalization and identification of DEGs (FDR<0.05, |log2FC|>=1) were conducted
using the R package limma [17].

Results
Transcriptome profiling of virus-host interactions following SARS-CoV-2
infection
We carried out in time-course experiments to identify dynamic changes in transcripts
in response to SARS-CoV-2 based on the infected and mock-infected groups across
four time points (0, 7, 12 and 24 hpi), in which three biologically independent replicates
for each treatment group were used for constructing cDNA libraries. The Calu-3 human

airway epithelial cell line, a model of human respiratory disease [16], was used as the
host cell of SARS-CoV-2, subjected to the same MOI and host cell used in the previous
analyses of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. After the total RNA isolation and
sequencing, we obtained the host transcriptomes, as well as the genomes and transcripts
of viruses. The high-throughput sequencing resulted in an average of 49 million pairedend reads per sample, and the sequencing quality was high with a mean mapping rate
of unique reads at approximately 72% among mock samples (Supplementary Table 1).
The quality control of all samples was assessed by the PCA analysis based on
normalized counts from DESeq2, which indicated that high quality was achieved given
that the majority of samples were well clustered except only one sample from the
infection group at 24 hpi that was removed before further analysis (Figure 1A).

Rapid growth of SARS-CoV-2 accompanied by dynamic changes of host genes
To evaluate the growth rate of SARS-CoV-2, we calculated the RNA level of the virus
represented by unique reads mapping rates at different time points. Our results showed
that in general the virus reads increased sharply from 1.4% to 61.2% while reads
mapped to the host genome dropped rapidly from 67.2% to 11.4% (Figure 1B),
suggesting a rapid replication of the virus within 24 hours. From the results, at the
earliest time point (0 hpi), virus produced high-levels of viral genome RNA as
evidenced by relatively even coverage depth across the whole genome (Figure 1C).
Interestingly, we found that there was a significantly active transcription of the 3’ end
of SARS-CoV-2 at 7 hpi, especially for the M, 6, 7a, 7b, 8b and N genes (Figure 1C)

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.30.071274; this version posted May 1, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

which could play important roles in the antagonism with host immune response[18, 19].
After that, the relatively even depth distribution of reads along viral genome was again
observed at panels of 12 and 24 hpi. This time-dependent patterns of virus replication
and transcription was most likely to play critical roles in the pathology of SARS-CoV2.
To elucidate the global changes of host gene expression along with virus growth, we
identified the overall up- and down-regulated DEGs during SARS-CoV-2 infection
(Figure 1D and Supplementary Table 2). As shown in Figure 1D, during the early stage
of infection before 7 hpi, there were many more up-regulated genes than downregulated genes (498 vs 212 at 0 hpi, 71 vs 11 at 7 hpi), soon after, the number of downregulated genes significantly exceeds that of up-regulated genes (924 vs 1501 at 12 hpi,
2473 vs 3611 at 24 hpi). Most importantly, most of DEGs at 0 hpi were suppressed at 7
hpi, which simultaneously occurred with active transcription of the 3’ end of SARSCoV-2 genome, demonstrating the critical role of the 3’ end in antagonizing host
immune response. The suppression of host responses were not likely due to sequencing
bias because the three samples from the infected group at 7 hpi were clustered with
mock samples (Figure 1A). Interestingly, there seem to be some correlated between the
decrease in the levels of the host transcriptome (compared to the total RNA level of
SARS-CoV-2) and the relative number of up-regulated genes (compared to downregulated genes) (Supplementary Figure 1). This may indicate the complex molecular
behavior of the host cell in response to the virus infection.

Comparison of host transcriptome responses to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV
To investigate specific host responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection, we performed a
comparative transcriptome analysis by integrating two public host transcriptomes of
SARS-CoV (GSE33267)[20] and MERS-CoV (GSE45042)[10] infected in the same
cell line with the same MOI. Overall, a huge divergence was presented in time-specific
DEG patterns among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 1D). For
SARS-CoV-2, 710 DEGs (498 up-regulated and 212 down-regulated) were
immediately induced at the very early stage (0 hpi), and many more DEGs were
gradually observed at the late stages (12 and 24 hpi). In contrast, SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV infected cells exhibited far fewer DEGs (0, 4 and 3 for SARS-CoV and 0,
6 and 54 for MERS-CoV) at the early stages (0, 7 and 12 hpi). However, more DEGs
were clearly detected at 24 hpi during SARS-CoV and especially MERS-CoV infection
(268 and 4302 respectively). This distinct DEG patterns indicated that SARS-CoV-2
actually induced earlier host responses compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
To further delineate differential perturbation of pathways among three viruses, we
conducted GO-enrichment analysis based on their respective DEGs. Overall,
substantially enriched pathways, such as inflammation, apoptosis, antiviral response,
transcription, translation and mitochondrion-related pathways, were detected at various
time points during SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 3). At 0
hpi, the up-regulated DEGs were mostly enriched in the pathways related to
inflammation-related pathways including the NF-kB signaling and cytokine-mediated

signaling pathways, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could induce inflammatory
responses at the very early stage of infection. At the same time, SARS-CoV-2 also
triggered the cellular apoptosis signaling pathway, implying that early onset cell death
happened along with inflammation response. Beginning at 7 hpi, our results showed a
significant enrichment in antivirus response-related pathways until 24 hpi (Figure 2).
At the late stages (12 and 24 hpi), down-regulated DEGs were exclusively enriched in
fundamental host pathways responsible for RNA processing and transcription, protein
translation and mitochondrial activity (Figure 2). Different from SARS-CoV-2, at the
late stage of SARS-CoV infection (24 hpi), the highly enriched genes were identified
to be involved in antivirus-related pathways, whereas no significantly enriched
pathways were found for MERS-CoV infection despite numerous DEGs existing at 24
hpi (Figure 2). Taken together, the above results indicated that the etiology mechanism
of SARS-CoV-2 was different from that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as implicated
by the overall differential patterns of the host response against infection.

Quantification of the capacity for host antiviral immunity and cytokine
production for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections
As mentioned above, SRAR-CoV-2 induced specific patterns of host antiviral and
inflammation responses compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. To quantify host
antiviral capacity and inflammation responses during infection of the three viruses, two
sets of genes were used as their indicators. First, we used a set of 45 early induced genes
in interferon- treated Calu-3 cell [7] as antiviral indicators to quantify the level of host

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.30.071274; this version posted May 1, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

antiviral capacity against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections. Our
analysis showed that, the antiviral capacity of the host against SARS-CoV-2 was
gradually increased over the time course of infection (Figure 3A). In contrast, the host
antiviral capacities against both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were nearly zero at least
during the initial stages of infection (between 0h and 12 hpi), followed by a marginal
increase at 24 hpi. The antiviral capacity in SARS-CoV and especially MERS-CoV
infected cells were much lower than that in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, which might
underpin the disparity in mortality between the three viruses. Despite the observation
of the potent early-induced host antiviral activity during SARS-CoV-2 infection as
compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection, our results clearly showed that
most of the genes (25/45) were significantly induced among infections of the three
viruses (Figure 3B). In addition, a list of the virus-specific antiviral-related genes was
identified, including PARP10[21] and CMPK2[22] for SARS-CoV-2, BST2[23],
ITITM1 and USP41 for SARS, and PARP4[24] for MERS-CoV (Figure 3B).
Secondly, we further used a set of 113 human cytokines to quantify host inflammation
responses between three viruses. The 113 cytokines from the CytoReg database were
often cited by various publications and play a primary role in the immune system[25].
Our results showed that, for SARS-CoV-2, the level of cytokine production was highly
induced at 0 hpi, decreased at 7 hpi, and then slowly recovered thereafter (Figure 3C).
Relatively high levels of cytokine expression only occurred at 24 hpi for SARS-CoV
and MERS-CoV. Our analysis also provided evidence that SARS-CoV-2 had more
cytokines in common with SARS-CoV than with MERS-CoV (Figure 3D). Unlike the

other two viruses, MERS-CoV specifically induced the expression of dozens of
cytokines, such as LTA, IL19, CXCL13 and CCL3, at 24 hpi, which were not observed
in the case of the other two viruses. Interestingly, among the 28 up-regulated cytokines
at the very early stage (0 hpi) during SARS-CoV-2 infection, eight cytokines including
IL-6 (IL6), IL-1b (IL1B), IL-8 (CXCL8), G-CSF (CSF3), GM-CSF (CSF2), IP10
(CXCL10), MCP1 (CCL2) and TNF were reported to exhibit substantially elevated
serum levels [9, 26, 27], which indicated that early induction of cytokines played
critical roles in the pathology of SARS-CoV-2. While most of the eight cytokines were
moderately up-regulated at the late stage during SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections,
up-regulation were not observed at the early stage. Collectively, SARS-CoV-2 induced
distinct patterns of host antiviral response and cytokine production.

Regulation of key genes from cell entry to type-Ⅰ interferon production
Next, to gain possible explanations for the distinct patterns in host antiviral capacity
and cytokine production during SARS-CoV-2 infection, dynamic expression of four
types of key genes were evaluated, including virus receptors for cell entry, pathogen
recognition receptors (PRRs) for an innate immune startup, regulator genes for
induction of antiviral-related genes and interferon production (Figure 4). For the three
cell entry related genes (ACE2 as the receptor of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [28,
29], DPP4 as the receptor of MERS-CoV [30] and protease TMPRSS2 for S protein
priming of SARS-CoV-2 [27]), we observed the dramatic changes in TMPRSS2
expression with very early induction during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the slightly

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.30.071274; this version posted May 1, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

down-regulated expression of ACE2 in cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 and SARSCoV, whereas DPP4 was more up-regulated in MERS-CoV (Figure 4). For the two
PRRs, DDX58 is a canonical RIG-I-like receptor for RNA virus recognition[31], and
TLR3 is a Toll-like receptor playing important roles in initiating a protective innate
immune response to highly pathogenic coronavirus infections[32]. We observed that all
three viruses had a notably up-regulated expression of DDX58 while only MERS-CoV
had a suppressed TLR3 at the 24 hpi (Figure 4), which is consistent with the fact that
decreased expression of TLR3 contributes to the pathology of highly pathogenic
coronavirus infections[32]. Among the four regulator genes, IRF7 is responsible for the
expression of most IFN-α subtypes and the type I IFN amplification loop[33], and IRF9,
STAT1 and STAT2 form the ISGF3 complex that binds to interferon-stimulated
response elements and thereby induces the expression of interferon-stimulated
genes[34]. As expected, gradually up-regulation of the four primary regulator genes
was observed for all three viruses (Figure 4). At last, we found a significant difference
in the expression of IFNB1 between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV,
indicating that IFNB1 likely accounted for the observed variations of the host antiviral
capacities among three viruses (Figure 4). Taken together, early induction of TMPRSS2
and gradually increased expression level of IFNB1 were likely responsible for the
distinct host immune response patterns of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Conclusion
Using time-series profiling of the virus genome and host transcriptome at the same time

during SARS-CoV-2 infection coupled with comparative transcriptome analysis, we
found that, compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 induces strong host
cell responses at the very early stage of infection that not only favor its high infectivity
to host cells but also restrict its pathogenesis.

Discussion
Here we sequenced the transcriptomes of SARS-CoV-2 and virus-infected host cells
simultaneously during the early stages of infection, providing a robust reference dataset
to speculate the antagonistic pattern between pathogen and host cells. To summarize,
our findings showed that SARS-CoV-2 induced the significantly high expression of the
cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 at 0 hpi to help the entry of viral particles into
cells[28] (Figure 4). At the same time, host cell initiated an immediate response for the
invasion of SARS-CoV-2 virus (Figure 1D). Then, the virus successfully suppressed
the acute response of host cells for fast proliferation by increasing the transcripts of its
3’ genome end, including M, 6, 7a, 7b, 8 and N genes which were consistent with their
reported regulations to host immune response[18, 19]. As a response from hosts cell, a
number of antiviral pathways and cytokine productions were up-regulated to resist the
virus infection (Figures 2 and 3). In particular, several metabolism-associated pathways
were down-regulated at 12hpi and 24 hpi (Figure 2). After the antagonistic cycle, a
dramatic proliferation of viral particles was detected in the early infection of host cells
(Figure 1B), which could possibly be an explanation for the fast spread of SARS-CoV-

2 in humans.

As SARS-CoV-2 was reported a relatively low risk of mortality[3] compared to the
other two serious human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, we compared and
contrasted the host transcriptomes in response to the viral infections. We found that
some cytokines in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells were markedly up-regulated at a very
early stage, which was not observed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and even less
frequently observed for other viruses. The unusual high expression of cytokines at 0 hpi
possibly explains why patients with severe clinical symptoms rapidly deteriorated.
Although the number of infected cases was very high, the majority of infections
displayed mild symptoms which are partly explained by a gradual increase in host
antiviral capability from 7 to 24 hpi. In contrast to SARS-CoV-2, both SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV were able to inhibit the antiviral capability of the host significantly, which
could explain their observed relatively high mortalities. MERS was associated with a
higher mortality than SARS, which could be in part attributed to the higher expression
of cytokines suppressing the antiviral responses.

Recently, Blanco-Melo et al. [5] have published transcriptome data of host responses
to SARS-CoV-2 from in vitro cell lines including A549 (MOI of 0.2) and NHBE (MOI
of 2) at 24 hpi. This previously published data is complemented by our study designed
to investigate the early response phase of cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-2. While
the previous work did not observe the elevated levels of IFNB1, IFNL1 and IFNL3, our

findings show that not only IFNB1 but also IFNL1 and IFNL3 expressions are upregulated between 7 and 24 hpi (Figure 3D). Also, they did not detect gene expression
of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 at 24 hpi, while we observed that ACE2 is down-regulated at
24 hpi and TMPRSS2 is only up-regulated at 0 hpi before returning to the normal levels
(Figure 4). Our time-series sampling revealed distinct early-response features of SARSCoV-2, which provided a possible explanation for some clinical observations. For
example, a recent clinical study [35] found that SARS-CoV-2 could replicate effectively
in upper respiratory tract tissues, and that the viral loads appeared earlier (before day 5)
and were substantially more than expected. Findings from the present study have
confirmed that, at 7 hpi, the 3’ end of SARS-CoV-2 genome start to express densely,
reducing the effectiveness of host immune surveillance, which possibly enables the
rapid replication of SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory tract tissues.

In spite of the fact that several studies have already demonstrated a consistent
correlation between gene expression measured by RNA-Seq and by microarray [36-38],
we still need to exclude the possibility of bias resulting from different methodologies.
First, because RNA-Seq can potentially detect more genes than microarrays, we only
considered protein-coding genes for the analysis of RNA-Seq results. For SARS-CoV2, the microarray analysis identified more than 90% of the 6800 DEGs, including 6514
DEGs of SARS-CoV and 6198 DEGs of MERS-CoV. Secondly, expressions of the
6800 DEGs were distributed over the four time points from low to high, not only in
SARS-CoV-2 but also in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Supplementary Figures 2 and

3), indicating that the silent early host responses to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV
appeared not to be due to technological biases. Lastly, when extending the infection
time from 24 hpi to 72hpi (GSE33267), thousands of DEGs (minimum 1022 and
maximum 2017 genes) , which had been inhibited at the early stages, were actually
induced (Supplementary Figure 4).
