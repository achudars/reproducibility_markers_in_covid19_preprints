Abstract:
SARS-CoV-2 is a unique event, having emerged suddenly as a highly infectious viral pathogen
for human populations. Previous phylogenetic analyses show its closest known evolutionary
relative to be a virus detected in bats (RaTG13), with a common assumption that SARS-CoV-2
evolved from a zoonotic ancestor via recent genetic changes (likely in the Spike protein receptor
binding domain – or RBD) that enabled it to infect humans. We used detailed phylogenetic
analysis, ancestral sequence reconstruction, and in situ molecular dynamics simulations to examine
the Spike-RBD’s functional evolution, finding that the common ancestral virus with RaTG13,
dating to at least 2013, possessed high binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor. This suggests
that SARS-CoV-2 likely possessed a latent capacity to bind to human cellular targets (though this
may not have been sufficient for successful infection) and emphasizes the importance to expand
the cataloging and monitoring of viruses circulating in both human and non-human populations.

Main Text:
Introduction:
Viral pathogens are a continuous and evolving challenge for human populations.1,2 Most known
viruses maintain species-specific infectivity, often co-evolving with their host to mirror animal
species trees.3,4 While less common, the emergence of novel viral pathogens is of particular interest
because they often exhibit abnormal degrees of infectivity and/or virulence,5 having not evolved
to a natural selection balance with their new host.6 Viruses of animal origin include periodic Ebola
outbreaks,7 the 1918 “Spanish Flu”,8 and most recently, SARS-CoV-2, the viral agent that causes
COVID-19.9 In these cases, viruses spread through human populations after evolving to “cross the
species barrier”.10 Yet, many questions remain for viruses of non-human origin: How do they
acquire the ability to infect humans? Is it wholly dependent on “recognition” (a function typically
mediated by protein-protein binding between viral capsid and target host cell), or must there be
changes in other viral replication mechanisms as well? And specifically focusing on SARS-Cov2, did it evolve to infect humans via many evolutionary changes or only a few? Was it dependent
on a key functional shift in its ability to bind human cells, or is there evidence that other genomic
changes were needed for it to acquire its strikingly high degree of infectivity? Answering these
questions is critical if we are to understand both the origin of specific viruses, such as SARS-CoV2, as well as the capacity of animal viruses to evolve human infectivity.
SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 201911 and has high infectivity, spreading rapidly around the world,
causing a global health emergency.12 A member of the Coronaviridae family of polymorphic,
enveloped, single stranded RNA viruses,13 it is thought that SARS-CoV-2 evolved from a zoonotic
origin,14,15 owing to its clear evolutionary relationship with coronaviruses that have been isolated
from animals16 (its closest known evolutionary relative is the bat coronavirus, RaTG1317–20 and
the second-closest known relative is a pangolin coronavirus, Pangolin-CoV).21 While most of the
SARS-CoV-2 genome mirrors the RaTG13 genome, some genomic regions, including the Spike
glycoprotein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) (which mediates viral entry into host cells), have
greater sequence similarity to the Pangolin-CoV homolog,22 prompting some to suggest SARSCoV-2 may be the product of recombination during co-infection.21–24
The Spike protein is a key component of the SARS-CoV-2 infection pathway.25 Knockout and
overexpression studies have demonstrated that binding of the Spike-RBD to human angiotensin
converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) mediates cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2.26–30 The SARS-CoV-2
Spike protein binds the hACE2 receptor with greater affinity than the SARS-CoV-1 homolog,
suggesting as a possible explanation for its greater infectivity.29 As a result, it has been suggested
that high affinity for hACE2 is a recently acquired trait for the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD.32–34
Given this, a critical question remains to be answered: How and when did the SARS-CoV-2 Spike
protein evolve its relatively higher affinity for the hACE2?
With this question in mind, we set out to robustly characterize the evolutionary changes that
accompanied the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, and that distinguish it from its closest zoonotic
relatives. We focused on the evolution of the Spike-RBD by leveraging its known evolutionary
relationships to other animal and human viruses and employed ancestral sequence reconstruction
in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations to identify biochemical and biophysical
changes that enhanced Spike binding to the hACE2 receptor.
Results/Discussion:
Our initial phylogenetic analysis, performed to provide context, utilized whole viral genomic data,
and generally supports prior studies’ conclusions, finding similar levels of nucleotide identity to
the RaTG13 genome (96.0% sequence identity) and the Guangxi Pangolin-CoV genome (90.0%

sequence identity) (Supplementary Figure 1).21,29 Next, we sought to investigate the evolution of
SARS-CoV-2 infectivity by performing ancestral sequence reconstruction for the Spike-RBD
amino acid sequence (Figure 1A). While cross-species protein sequence comparisons have been
used to investigate critical amino acid changes in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein,37 leveraging the
phylogenetic relationships allows us to infer the most likely ancestral sequences for this protein
allows us to focus on the subset of genetic changes that are specific to its recent evolution.38 We
inferred statistically well-supported reconstructions of the Spike-RBD sequence for both the
common ancestor of all human SARS-CoV-2 cases (labelled “N1”, Figure 1A,C) and the its
common ancestor with the closest animal virus (labelled “N0”, Figure 1A,C). N1 is identical to
the Spike-RBD in the SARS-CoV-2 reference sequence, as expected, while the N0 Spike-RBD
sequence is, to our knowledge, unique, reflecting the uniqueness of SARS-CoV-2’s viral
origin.21,39 N0 differs from N1 at 4 positions (346, 372, 498, and 519 – Figure 1B). The
reconstruction of N1 for each of those positions is statistically well-supported, with a posterior
probability (P.P.) of 1 obtained from two independent calculations (Supplemental Table 1;
Supplementary Methods). The reconstruction for N0 has high statistical support for positions
346, 372, and 519 (P.P. > 0.94), while position 498 was ambiguously reconstructed, with two
alternate states comparably probable (Supplemental Table 1). All other positions were
reconstructed with high confidence (P.P.>0.85). Together, these four changes (t346R, t372A,
h/y498Q, and n519H) differentiate the evolved SARS-Cov-2 Spike protein from the most recent
common ancestor with animal viruses (Figure 1). As such, this ancestral virus must have existed
at least as early as 2013 (as one of its descendants – RaTG13 – was isolated in that year), meaning
that the branch between the N0 and N1 ancestors covers at least 7 years of molecular evolution
(Figure 1A).
To quantify functional differences between the N0 ancestor and the Spike-RBD sequences, we
conducted 10 ns molecular dynamics simulations (see Supplementary Methods) of the Spike
Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in complex with hACE2 (starting point for each simulation was
modelled off crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD/hACE2 complex),27 which we
used to calculate the free energy contributions from electrostatics, polar solvation, van Der Waals
interactions, and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) to infer the free energy of binding
between those two proteins.40,41 We quantified the root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) of the
portion of the RBD closest to the hACE2 receptor (residues 397 to 512) for each of our replicates
to confirm complex stability (Supplementary Figure 2). Contrary to our expectations, the free
energy of binding between the Spike-RBD and the hACE2 appears to have decreased between N0
and N1. In fact, each of the 4 changes either reduced or did not significantly change the free energy
of binding (Figure 2A) (this is true for both alternate reconstructions of position 498 in N0). While
overall these four historical changes reduced binding affinity to hACE2, they did not do so equally:
t346R and h/y498Q showed the largest decreases in affinity (Figure 2B). Additionally, there was
no evidence of an epistatic relationship among the four substitutions (see Supplementary
Methods).
Somewhat surprised by these reductions in binding energy between the N0 and N1 state, we set
out to confirm that our observations were not an outcome of oversimplifications in the MD
forcefield. We compared standardized changes in binding energy in our MD data and recently
released in vitro data 42 and saw remarkably similar changes in binding energy (p = 0.042,
Equivalence Test for Means) (Supplemental Table 3). In particular, both alternative reconstructed
states for position 498 in N0 clearly improve hACE2 binding affinity in both our simulations and
in in vitro functional measurements (Figure 2; Supplemental Table 3).42 There was a discrepancy

between the two datasets at position 372 and future in vitro experiments are required to determine
the combined effects of this mutation with the other substitutions (Figure 2; Supplemental Table
3).
Nonetheless, these results demonstrate that, contrary to expectations, evolutionary changes since
2013 did not improve the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD’s binding with hACE2. While there are other
animal coronaviruses known to bind to the hACE2 receptor,43 to our knowledge, this is the first
demonstration that the SARS-CoV-2’s common ancestor with the RaTG13 lineage may have been
capable of binding to hACE2. This has important implications for our understanding of how
SARS-CoV-2 evolved to infect humans. First, it suggests that the binding affinity between the
Spike-RBD and hACE2 may not be a critical driver of the high degree of infectivity that has been
observed during its recent outbreak. Instead, it suggests that tight hACE2 binding may be a latent
property of this virus, and that high infectivity may instead have emerged via a distinct set of
molecular changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Second, it calls into question the presumption of
a recent zoonotic origin for this disease; while other molecular components of the current SARSCoV-2 virus may have acquired recent evolutionary changes that promoted its infectivity in
humans, it appears that the high affinity for hACE2 was not among them.
If this is the case – that this viral lineage possessed the ability to bind hACE2 with high affinity
for at least the past 7 years (Figure 1B) – then why did it not emerge as a public health issue until
recently? One possibility is that binding hACE2 by the Spike-RBD is not sufficient, on its own, to
infect humans, and that other molecular components first needed to acquire new functions to do
so. A second possibility is that this virus may have been capable of infecting human cells for a
longer period of time in the past, but that its ancestral form either presented with far fewer
symptoms (making it less disruptive and/or noticeable to those infected), or that it was far less
infectious (thereby impacting only a small number of people), in either case escaping the notice of
public health monitoring (Figure 3). To test this, a broad and concerted effort to sequence the
range of coronaviruses across human populations would need to be conducted, in order to test
whether a closely related virus may also be circulating.44–46
Naturally, as an in silico study, these results should be interpreted with some caution. Insofar as
they can be validated, however, they are largely consistent with direct functional measurements in
the lab.42 Ideally, combinatorial libraries could be constructed47,48 and functionally screened48 in
order to glean more detailed insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the recent
evolution of this virus.
Conclusion:
Predicting the emergence of highly infectious and virulent diseases, while difficult, is vital for
human population health.50 To do so, however, we must take steps to understand how pandemic
diseases – such as SARS-CoV-2 – emerged as they did, and to understand if and when they
acquired the novel molecular functions that enabled their infectivity. In this case, it appears that
the SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD did not recently evolve binding affinity to a human-specific protein.
Instead, that function appears to have been latent, making it clear that the evolution of this disease
– along with so many other aspects of its etiology – is more complex than expected.
Materials and Methods:
To confirm SARS-CoV-2 etiology we constructed a phylogenetic tree using PhyML 3.0 of 26
known enzootic and endemic viruses aligned using MAFFT version 7. We then obtained the amino
acid spike glycoprotein sequences from the coronaviruses in our phylogeny and 479 SARS-CoV2 samples, by either downloading the sequences from NCBI – if available, or through extraction

using nBLASTx. Spike sequences were then aligned, and ancestral sequence reconstruction was
performed using two software packages (RaxML and GRASP).
Next, we performed in silico mutagenesis of x-ray crystallography structures for the SARS-CoV2 spike protein RBD-hACE2 complex to create a library of mutational differences between the
current SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and our inferred ancestor. Molecular interactions for each
structure in the library were then characterized through 10 ns MD simulations run in GROMACS.
Binding energy between residues 397 to 512 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and the hACE2
receptor in the MD simulations were calculated using g_mmpbsa and genetic effects were
measured for these energies.
Finally, MD energy outputs were compared to existing in vitro data using standard statistical
methods.

Supplementary Methods
Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 etiology
A phylogenetic analysis of 26 viral genomes was performed to confirm known SARS-CoV-2
ancestors. 24 known enzootic and endemic viruses and the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome and
the Pangolin-CoV genome were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI)51 and Lam et al.21 respectfully. Selected sequences were aligned using the
Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform Version 7 (MAFFT) FFT-NS-2 algorithm. 52,53
MAFFT default parameters were used in our alignment, meaning gap penalties were assigned a
value of 1.53. PhyML 3.0 was employed to construct a phylogeny of aligned genomes. 54,55 Bayes
values ≥ 0.90 were considered statistically significant. The output tree was visualized using the
online tool, Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL), and statistically significant clades were examined to
validate current knowledge surrounding SARS-CoV-2 evolution.56
Construction of spike glycoprotein ancestral sequence:
nBLASTx, run using a BLOSUM 62 matrix, a gap opening penalty of 11 and a gap extension
penalty of 1, was employed to extract the Spike glycoprotein from the 479 SARS-CoV-2
sequences obtained from GISAID58,59 selecting for one sequence per day per country from
December 30, 2019 to March 25, 2020, and the Pangolin-CoV genome.57 Additional, Spike
sequences, including the RaTG13 Spike protein, were obtained directly from NCBI.51 Protein
sequences were initially aligned using the Multiple Sequence Alignment by Log-Expectation
(MUSCLE) program.60 The optimal parameters for phylogenetic reconstruction analysis were
taken from the best-fit evolutionary model selected using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
implemented in the PROTTEST3 software,61 and were inferred to be the Jones-Taylor-Thornton
(JTT) model62 with gamma-distributed among-site rate variation and empirical state frequencies.
Phylogeny was inferred from these alignments using the RaXML v8.2.9 software63 and results
were visualized using FigTree v1.4.4 (https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases). Ancestral
sequence reconstruction was performed with the FastML software64 and further validated
independently using the Graphical Representation of Ancestral Sequence Predictions (GRASP)
software.65 Statistical confidence in each position’s reconstructed state for each ancestor
determined from posterior probability; any reconstructed positions with less than 95% posterior
probability was considered ambiguous, and alternate states were also tested.
Mutagenesis of ancestral proteins:
To understand the evolutionary importance of sequence changes observed between ancestral,
zoonotic, and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences, in silico mutagenesis and binding energy
studies were performed. A previously constructed x-ray crystallography structure for the
complex between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the
human hACE2 receptor were obtained from RCSB (accession number 6M0J). Utilizing PyMOL
mutagenesis wizard, 66 the four missense mutations (R346t, A372t, Q498h or Q498y, H519n)
identified between the N0 and N1 sequences were introduced into the SARS-CoV-2 RBD
sequence, replicating the sequence of the putative ancestral zoonotic (N0) sequence. In addition
to the N1 and N0 structures, additional structures were developed in a similar fashion, selectively
including each of the 4 mutations to represent all of the possible combinations that these
mutations may have existed throughout evolutionary time

Molecular interactions were characterized with molecular dynamics simulations using
GROMACS, TIP3P waters and CHARM07 force-field parameters for proteins. For each
condition, three replicate 10 ns simulations were run, starting from crystal structures or structural
models. Historical mutations were introduced and energy-minimized before MD simulation. Each
system was solvated in a cubic box with a 10 Å margin, then neutralized and brought to 150 mM
ionic strength with sodium and chloride ions. This was followed by energy minimization to
remove clashes, assignment of initial velocities from a Maxwell distribution, and 1 ns of solvent
equilibration in which the positions of heavy protein and DNA atoms were restrained. Production
runs were 50 ns, with the initial 10 ns excluded as burn-in. The trajectory time step was 2 fs, and
final analyses were performed on frames taken every 12.5 ps. We used TIP3P waters and the
CHARM07 FF03 parameters for proteins, as implemented in GROMACS 4.5.5.67 Analyses were
performed using VMD 1.9.1.68 GROMACS output was uploaded into Visual Molecular Dynamics
(VMD) for Root-Mean Squared Deviation (RMSD) Analysis using the RMSD trajectory tool (ref).
After discovering large deviations in RMSD values for the full RBD, which we attributed to noise
at the ends of the RBD, we isolated our analysis to residues 397 to 512 of the RBD.
Measurement of binding energies:
Next, we measured the binding energies between residues 397 to 512 and the ACE2 receptor using
g_mmpbsa, a program which employs Molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface area
(MMPBSA) calculations to determine binding energy. Van der Waal forces, polar solvation
energy, apolar solvation energy and SASA energy were calculated every 0.25 ns using a gridspace
of 0.5 and a solute dielectric constant of 2. The output of the three replicates was amalgamated and
binding energy was calculated using the bootstrap analysis (n = 2000 bootstraps) published by
Kumari et al.40,41 We then characterize the genetic effect of each mutation (on average) and
assessed whether there were any statistically significant epistatic interactions using established
methods.46,47
Comparison to in vitro data:
In vitro changes in binding energy for the four mutation were obtained from Starr et al. 42. These
data and our binding energies for the N1, 346_372_498, 346_372_519, 346_498_519 and
372_498_519 were each standardized using Z-scores. Changes in binding energy to the N1 state
for each standardized score was calculated by subtracting the N1 energy from the mutant energy.
An equivalence test for means (TOST) test was performed on the standardized changes in binding
energy.

Table of MM/PBSA binding energies between receptor binding domains of SARS-CoV-2
evolutionary constructs and hACE2 receptor (note that lower energy indicates tighter binding).
Blue cells indicate the presence of the ancestral (N0) state and green cells (with an “x”) indicate
the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 state (N1) at a given position. Two values are present for
constructs with an ancestral (N0) state at position 498 (which reflect the ambiguity of its
ancestral reconstruction), corresponding to h498 and y498 from left to right. Energies are shown
as the mean of three replicate simulations with SEM indicated in parenthesis. B. Relative effect
of changes in SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain from ancestral (N0) to SARS-CoV-2 (N1)
state on MM/PBSA binding energies. Size of spheres indicate the relative magnitude, with red
spheres indicating decreased binding affinity and blue indicating increased binding affinity.
Values are averaged for h498 and y498 states (both raw values shown in parentheses). C.
Comparison of molecular dynamics and in vitro z-score normalized changes in binding energy
for each mutation from N0 to N1. Changes are shown relative to the z-score normalized current
(N1) binding energy. D. Box plot illustrating the range of z-score normalized changes in binding
energy for the in vitro and molecular dynamics data. An equivalence test for means (p = 0.042)
suggests that the molecular dynamics simulation reflects in vitro data.

Figure 3. Schematic of two possible evolutionary scenarios stemming from the observed
evolutionary SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD function. In Scenario 1, it is postulated that a zoonotic
ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain possessed the ability to effectively bind hACE2 but was unable to
effectively enter human cells, requiring the presence of subsequent mutations to infect
humans. In Scenario 2, an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain was actively infecting humans prior to
the outbreak at low levels, thus escaping public health detection until subsequent mutations
lead to increased infectivity and/or severity.

Supplementary Figure 2: RMSD of simulation data used for energy calculations. Rootmean-square deviation (RMSD) is shown for simulation window that was used to calculate
complex binding energy. Note that the Spike-RBD maintains a consistent stable configuration at
the interface with hACE2, suggesting our energy calculations can be safely compared across
simulations and that higher random stochasticity should not be a confounding factor.

Supplementary Figure 3: Maximum Parsimony Reconstruction of hACE2 binding by
Spike-RBD. While weak evidence on its own, a reconstruction by maximum parsimony of
Spike-RBD ability to bind hACE2 for the closest relatives of SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with our
ancestral reconstruction here in suggesting that the common ancestor with RaTG13 possessed
high binding affinity for hACE2.

Supplemental Table 1: Statistical confidence of ancestral sequence reconstructions for
positions that vary between N0 and N1. Ancestral sequence reconstruction was assessed via
computed posterior probability for each reconstructed state at each position in the sequence. The
posterior probability for each reconstructed state at the four key positions that vary between N0
and N1 is shown, as calculated by two independent software packages (FastML and GRASP).

Supplementary Table 3. Results of an equivalence test for means. Equivalence test compares
z-score standardized molecular dynamics data to z-score standardized in vitro data. Test
illustrates that the molecular dynamics simulation reflects in vitro SARS-CoV-2 binding energies
(p = 0.042).
