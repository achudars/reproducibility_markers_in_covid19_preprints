Abstract

12

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread closure of schools and universities. These institutions

13

have turned to distance learning to provide educational continuity. Schools now face the challenge of how to

14

reopen safely and resume in-class learning. However, there is little empirical evidence to guide decision-

15

makers on how this can be achieved. Here, we show that selectively deploying e-learning for larger classes is

16

highly effective at decreasing campus-wide opportunities for student-to-student contact, while allowing most

17

in-class learning to continue uninterrupted. We conducted a natural experiment at a large university that

18

implemented a series of e-learning interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak. Analyses of >24 million

19

student connections to the university Wi-Fi network revealed that population size can be manipulated by e-

20

learning in a targeted manner according to class size characteristics. Student mixing showed accelerated growth

21

with population size according to a power law distribution. Therefore, a small e-learning dependent decrease in

22

population size resulted in a large reduction in student clustering behaviour. Our results show that e-learning

23

interventions can decrease potential for disease transmission while minimizing disruption to university

24

operations. Universities should consider targeted e-learning a viable strategy for providing educational

25

continuity during early or late stages of a disease outbreak.

Main
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had enormous socioeconomic impact1. In 5 months, 5.5

29

million COVID-19 cases have been confirmed, resulting in 350,000 deaths across 188 countries2. The severe

30

acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is primarily spread when an

31

infected person sneezes or coughs3. The spread of infection can be slowed by public health measures that

32

reduce person-to-person contact. Nonpharmaceutical interventions that include restricted travel, staying at

33

home, and physical distancing can delay and flatten the peak of COVID-19 cases to avoid the overwhelming of

34

medical services4-6. Nonpharmaceutical interventions therefore play a critical role in controlling the spread of

35

disease until effective vaccines or drugs are available7.

36

School closure is a key strategy for controlling the spread of infectious diseases7-9. Empirical and

37

modelling studies show that closing schools and universities can suppress COVID-19 transmission when

38

combined with other nonpharmaceutical interventions5,6,10. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an

39

unprecedented number of school and university closures, affecting over 1.2 billion learners worldwide11.

40

Consequently, a massive shift from classroom learning to distance learning has occurred12. This has created

41

great strain on educational institutions which function not only as places of learning, but also as major

42

employers and drivers of local economies. It is therefore important to consider less disruptive interventions to

43

ensure educational continuity13. However, there is a major knowledge gap in how student mixing patterns on

44

campus are affected by school policies enacted during the disease outbreak. Evidence-based solutions are

45

needed for schools and universities to re-open safely as soon as possible.

46

We conducted a natural experiment to evaluate the impact of implementing e-learning measures on

47

student population dynamics at the National University of Singapore (NUS) during the COVID-19 outbreak.

48

NUS is the largest university in Singapore, with about 24,000 undergraduate students per year enrolled in

49

course modules with in-class learning (Extended Data Table 1). In line with the national public health

50

response, NUS adopted nonpharmaceutical interventions that aimed to reduce risk of SARS-CoV-2

51

transmission (Extended Data Table 2). Normal in-class learning took place during the first 4 weeks of the

52

semester, coinciding with the first imported case of COVID-19 (Fig. 1a). Shortly afterward the first local

53

transmission of COVID-19 was identified. This escalated the nationwide pandemic response and prompted

54

NUS to implement e-learning over the next several weeks for all classes with >50 students. As the number of

55

COVID-19 cases continued to climb in Singapore and globally as a pandemic, NUS implemented e-learning

56

for all classes with >25 students. One week later, nationwide ‘enhanced circuit-breaker’ measures were

57

announced, which led to the suspension of all in-class learning.

58

The multi-phased transition to e-learning during the COVID-19 outbreak provided a unique opportunity

59

to investigate student mixing patterns on campus. Social interactions and their products show super-linear

60

growth with population size14-18. Hence, interventions that reduce the number of students by a small amount

61

would be expected to decrease substantially the potential for person-to-person contact and disease

62

transmission. We predicted that the shift to e-learning would result in a moderate drop in the number of

63

students on campus due to fewer students having to attend in-class sessions. We further predicted that this

64

would result in a large drop in opportunities for student mixing. These predictions were tested by

65

analysing >24 million student connections to the NUS Wi-Fi network, comprising several thousand Wi-Fi

66

access points across campus. Each time that a student connected to the Wi-Fi network, the time and location

67

data were recorded. These data were used to investigate students’ spatiotemporal mixing patterns before and

68

during the disease outbreak.

69

In the early part of the semester, there were about 16,500 students per school day who connected to the

70

NUS Wi-Fi network (Fig. 1b). The only notable exception was the eve of the Chinese New Year holiday, in

71

which the number of students detected by Wi-Fi dropped by about half. After the transition to e-learning for

72

classes with >50 students, there was a 30% decrease in the number of students detected on campus. Wi-Fi

73

connections decreased sharply in lecture theatres and moderately in classrooms and non-teaching facilities

74

(Fig. 1c). The number of students detected by Wi-Fi dropped by an additional 25% after e-learning was

75

implemented for classes with >25 students. These findings contrast with results from the previous academic

76

year in which the daily number of students detected by Wi-Fi on school days was stable across the semester

77

(Extended Data Fig. 1).

78

Effects of e-learning on the number of students on campus were determined by students’ class sizes and

79

schedules. The transition to e-learning for classes with >50 or >25 students impacted a small proportion of total

80

classes (9% and 19%, respectively) but these classes had high student enrolment (Extended Data Fig. 2).

81

Therefore, most students had at least one class that was converted to e-learning. On a typical school day, nearly

82

18,000 students had a scheduled class compared with 6,000 students with no class (Extended Data Fig. 2).

83

Due to heterogeneity in students’ timetables, the transition to e-learning resulted in a subset of students each

84

day with classes delivered only by e-learning (Fig. 1d). These students were detected on campus at about the

85

same rate as those who had no class (about 35-40%). In contrast, students with in-class learning were detected

86

at nearly twice the rate as those students with e-learning only or no class (about 60-80%). Linear regression

87

analysis showed that 90% of the variance in the daily number of students detected on campus was explained by

88

the number of students with in-class learning (Extended Data Fig. 3).

89

Next, we evaluated the impact of e-learning on student clustering behaviour. A student cluster was

90

defined as >25 students connected to the same Wi-Fi access point. We surveyed several thousand Wi-Fi access

91

points to determine the number of sites with student clustering and the duration of clustering at each of these

92

sites (Extended Data Fig. 4). There were several hundred Wi-Fi access points where clustering occurred, with

93

20% of these sites accounting for about 80% of the total duration of clustering behaviour over the semester

94

(Extended Data Fig. 5). The daily rhythm in number of students on campus drove the pattern of clustering

95

behaviour (Fig. 2a). In the early part of the semester, student clustering tracked the timing of lectures, whereas

96

this pattern was flattened with e-learning (Fig 2b).

97

During normal in-class learning, there were about 150 Wi-Fi access points per day where a student

98

cluster was detected (Fig. 2c), contributing to about 300 hours of clustering behaviour (Fig. 2d). The transition

99

to e-learning for classes with >50 students was associated with a 70% decrease in the number of sites with a

100

student cluster, as well as the duration of clustering at these sites. These findings differ from the prior academic

101

year, in which student clustering behaviour on school days changed little over the semester (Fig. 2c-d). The

102

transition to e-learning for classes with >25 students effectively eliminated student clustering. These findings

103

were further visualised by plotting the data on university map to identify hot spots of clustering activity (Fig.

104

2e). After e-learning, there was a marked reduction in student clustering in buildings where students usually

105

converged for classes and social activities.

106

Each e-learning transition was associated with a decrease in the number of unique pairs of students with

107

spatiotemporal overlap (Fig. 3a). Over a typical day, nearly half a million unique pairs of students showed Wi-

108

Fi connection overlap. This number was cut in half after e-learning was implemented for classes with >50

109

students, and it dropped further as more restrictive e-learning policies were enacted. We then examined the

110

degree of overlap for individual students (i.e., the number of unique pairs formed by a student), focusing on the

111

top 100 students per day with the greatest amount of spatiotemporal overlap with their peers (Fig. 3b). Each e-

112

learning transition was associated with a decrease in the degree of student overlap, with network plots

113

demonstrating weakening of the spatiotemporal student network (Fig. 3c).

114

Next, we investigated scaling properties of student mixing patterns with the number of students

115

detected on campus. The number of Wi-Fi access points with student clustering increased with student

116

population size according to a power law distribution (Fig. 4a). The relationship was super-linear whereby

117

growth in the number of student clusters accelerated with larger numbers of students on campus. Similar results

118

were observed for the daily duration of student clustering (Fig. 4b). These findings were reproducible using

119

data from the prior academic year, demonstrating that scaling properties of student clustering behaviour with

120

population size were generalisable and not related to the COVID-19 pandemic or implementation of e-learning

121

(Extended Data Fig. 6). Power law scaling of student clustering behaviour was also observed for different

122

types of locations on campus including teaching and non-teaching facilities (Extended Data Fig. 7).

123

Moreover, power law scaling was observed when alternative definitions of cluster size were tested, ranging

124

from >5 to >50 students detected at the same Wi-Fi access point (Extended Data Fig. 8). These analyses

125

showed that larger clusters of students were more sensitive to changes in population size (i.e., the exponent of

126

the power law function was greater), and that e-learning resulted in a marked decrease in the frequency and

127

duration of clustering behaviour for all cluster sizes. In line with these observations, the number of unique pairs

128

of students with spatiotemporal overlap exhibited super-linear scaling with daily population size (Fig. 4c), as

129

did the degree of overlap for ‘highly-connected’ individual students with their peers (Fig. 4d).

130

The scaling properties of student mixing patterns have important implications for strategies that seek to

131

minimize person-to-person contact during a disease outbreak. We showed that a small decrease in student

132

population size resulted in a large reduction in student clustering behaviour. Hence, an important goal for

133

reducing risk of disease transmission is to decrease the number of students on campus. This can be achieved in

134

a predictable manner by implementing e-learning for all classes that exceed a given class size. It is more

135

practical to focus on larger classes because they are often conducted in a lecture format that can be converted

136

easily to e-learning (e.g., video lecture), and they are a main driver of student clustering behaviour on campus.

137

The power law scaling we observed is consistent with prior work demonstrating accelerated growth of

138

human interactions with city population size14-18. Epidemiological models indicate that these scaling

139

relationships drive super-linear growth of disease transmission rates as cities get bigger15,17,18. Like cities,

140

universities are complex systems composed of different infrastructural and social elements whose hierarchical

141

structures give rise to scaling laws14,19. However, we found that the growth rates of student mixing patterns on

142

campus (determined by the exponent of the power law scaling function) were greater compared with studies on

143

scaling of human interactions with city size. This may be related to differences in student network dynamics

144

and university infrastructural components compared with cities in which they reside. Earlier work examined

145

social connectivity patterns derived from mobile phone call records and internet interactions16-18. Such methods

146

capture information about social networks but not the potential for physical contact between individuals. By

147

comparison, Wi-Fi connection data provide information on student proximity patterns, which is more relevant

148

for assessing disease transmission risk.

149
150

Our study is the first to measure campus-wide spatiotemporal mixing of students using the university’s
Wi-Fi network. At its core, this method requires counting of students connected to different Wi-Fi access

151

points. Students are only detected if they have a Wi-Fi enabled device that is actively scanning for a Wi-Fi

152

access point. The location where a student is connected also depends on the proximity and range of the nearest

153

Wi-Fi access point. Despite these limitations, prior studies have shown that Wi-Fi connections are as accurate

154

as dedicated physical sensors (e.g., infrared beam-break or thermal sensors) for estimating student occupancy

155

of university rooms and buildings20,21. The daily pattern of student Wi-Fi connections also conforms to

156

expectations for different sites on campus including teaching spaces, libraries, food courts, and residential

157

buildings20,22-24. An important limitation of our study is that we did not investigate student mixing with

158

university staff or visitors because we only had Wi-Fi data for students. In future work, it will be important to

159

evaluate the scaling properties of clustering behaviour while considering all persons on campus. Here, we took

160

advantage of the university’s existing Wi-Fi network infrastructure to collect data from students without the

161

need for their active participation. This approach can be adopted for continual monitoring of students’ Wi-Fi

162

connection patterns and clustering behaviour, and it can be extended to include all other users of the Wi-Fi

163

network.

164

In conclusion, e-learning is an intervention that universities can use to provide educational continuity

165

while decreasing student-to-student contact during a disease outbreak. We recommend that e-learning be

166

incorporated into each university’s pandemic preparedness plan. First, universities should evaluate their class

167

size distribution to determine the impact of a given e-learning policy on the daily number of students with in-

168

class learning. This information makes it possible to achieve a targeted reduction in student population size

169

because the number of students on campus is dependent on the proportion of students with in-class learning.

170

Second, universities should develop the capacity to count the number of students on campus because

171

population size is a main driver of student clustering behaviour and mixing patterns. This can be achieved

172

using existing Wi-Fi network infrastructure, and the data can be used to derive scaling properties of student

173

mixing with population size. Third, universities should periodically perform e-learning exercises during normal

174

operations. This can be used to measure the impact of e-learning on student mixing, and to test infrastructure

175

required for campus-wide e-learning during an epidemic25. Fourth, universities should consider how to

176

implement e-learning in view of the local and nationwide health response to a disease outbreak. A partial

177

transition to e-learning may be most appropriate before widespread community spread has occurred, or during

178

recovery to normal school operations. A full transition to e-learning may be required near the peak of an

179

epidemic. Taken together, our study establishes a roadmap that universities can follow for making evidence-

180

based decisions on students’ learning and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic and future disease outbreaks.

183

Student data and ethics statement

184

Our study was performed using university archived data managed by the NUS Institute for Applied

185

Learning Sciences and Educational Technology (ALSET). The ALSET Data Lake stores and links deidentified

186

student data across different university units for the purpose of conducting educational analytics research26.

187

Data tables in the ALSET Data Lake are anonymised by student tokens which map identifiable data to a hash

188

string using a one-way function that does not allow recovery of the original data. The same student-specific

189

tokens are represented across tables, allowing different types of data to be combined without knowing students’

190

identities. The data types used in our study included basic demographic information (age, sex, ethnicity,

191

citizenship, year of matriculation), class enrolment information, and Wi-Fi connection metadata. Students

192

included in our study provided informed consent to the NUS Student Data Protection Policy, which explains

193

that student data may be used for research and evaluating university policies. Research analyses were approved

194

by the NUS Learning Analytics Committee on Ethics.

Timeline of COVID-19 cases and university policies
The timeline of COVID-19 cases in Singapore was determined using daily situation reports published

204

Student timetables and class size characteristics
Student data were analysed in the second semester of the 2018/19 and 2019/20 school years. This

205

allowed us to compare student behaviour before and during the COVID-19 outbreak over an equivalent period

206

(from January to May). Students’ class schedules and class sizes were derived from student enrolment data

207

provided by the NUS Registrar’s Office. At NUS, students enrol in course modules, many of which are further

208

divided into different lectures, class groups, tutorials, or laboratory sessions. We analysed data in students

209

taking at least one module that required in-class learning (23,668 and 23,993 students in 2018/19 and 2019/20

210

school years). Data were excluded from students taking only fieldwork or project-based modules with no in-

211

class component (2,722 and 3,240 students). Class size was defined as the number of students who were

212

scheduled to meet in the same place for a given course module. The timing and location of classes were

213

retrieved using the NUSMods application programming interface (https://api.nusmods.com/v2/). Timetable

214

data were sorted for each school day of the semester to identify students with scheduled in-class learning.

215

These data were also used to determine which classes were converted to e-learning based on class size. This

216

allowed us to calculate the daily number of students with in-class learning, e-learning only, or no class.

219

Wi-Fi connection data
Connections to the NUS Wi-Fi network are continually monitored by NUS Information Technology to

220

evaluate and improve services provided to the university. The campus-wide wireless network comprises

221

several thousand Wi-Fi access points and deploys different types of routers (Cisco Aironet 1142, 2702I and

222

2802I) and wireless protocols (802.11n 2.4 GHz, 802.11n 5 GHz, and 802.11ac 5 GHz). Each time that a

223

person’s Wi-Fi enabled device associates with the NUS wireless network the transmission data are logged.

224

Students’ Wi-Fi connection metadata were added daily to the ALSET Data Lake by a data pipeline managed by

NUS Information Technology. Each data point included the tokenized student identity, the anonymized media

226

access control (MAC) address used to identify the Wi-Fi enabled device of the student (e.g., smartphone,

227

tablet, or laptop), the name and location descriptor of the Wi-Fi access point, and the start and end time of each

228

Wi-Fi connection. The name and location descriptor usually carried information about the room or building in

229

which the Wi-Fi access point was located. By cross-referencing these data with the known timing and location

230

of classes, we categorised Wi-Fi access points into teaching facilities (lecture theatres or classrooms) and non-

231

teaching facilities.

232
233
234

Analyses of student mixing patterns
The Wi-Fi dataset comprised more than 24 million student connections to the wireless network over 2

235

semesters. Students’ connection data were binned in 15-min intervals to reduce the size of the data, resulting in

236

11,328 epochs that spanned 118 days in each semester. In instances where students were connected to more

237

than one Wi-Fi access point in the same epoch, they were assigned to the access point in which their Wi-Fi

238

enabled device received the greatest volume of data (i.e., based on megabytes of data received). The resulting

239

table of Wi-Fi connections and access points was used to derive time and location information for each student

240

over the semester. This enabled us to count the daily number of students who connected to the Wi-Fi network,

241

and the number of students who were connected to the same Wi-Fi access point within a 15-min epoch. The

242

latter was used to examine student clustering behaviour. We defined a cluster as >25 students connected to the

243

same Wi-Fi access point because of the high potential for student-to-student contact, and it aligned with the

244

university’s e-learning policy prior to suspension of in-class learning (i.e., e-learning for class size >25). The

245

duration of student clustering at each Wi-Fi access point was calculated as the sum of 15-min epochs with >25

246

students. Data were analysed using R statistical software (version 3.6.3)31.

247

Geospatial clustering was visualised by plotting students’ data on a map of the NUS campus. The

248

researchers did not have access to the geospatial coordinates for Wi-Fi access points. Therefore, general

249

location information provided in the Wi-Fi metadata (e.g., name of the building or room) was used to

determine manually the building locations. Using sources that included the official NUS campus map and

251

venues listed on class timetables, we confirmed the geospatial coordinates for 80% of Wi-Fi access points.

252

Georeferencing was performed by mapping Wi-Fi access points to vector point shapefiles representing

253

individual buildings. The ESRI shapefiles required for mapping were obtained from the OpenStreetMap

254

geodatabase for the region of Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei (map tiles in the OpenStreetMap are licensed

255

under CC BY-SA www.openstreetmap.org/copyright, © OpenStreetMap contributor). We used QGIS software

256

(version 3.12.1) to edit the vector points and to insert names of Wi-Fi access points to the attribute table.

257

Student clustering within each building was determined by pooling the duration of clustering across all Wi-Fi

258

access points within the building. Subsequently, we merged the clustering duration data with the ESRI

259

shapefiles using the “sf” package (version 0.9-0)32 in the R software environment. The QGIS platform was then

260

used to visualise student clustering for 124 buildings across the NUS campus. Buildings with incomplete Wi-Fi

261

data and student hostels were excluded from the analysis.

262

The number of unique pairs of students with spatiotemporal overlap in their Wi-Fi connections was

263

determined for 4 representative weeks of the semester (weeks 4, 5, 11, 12). These time intervals captured the

264

transition from normal in-class learning to e-learning for classes with >50 students (week 4 to 5), and the

265

transition from e-learning for classes with >25 students to e-learning for all classes (week 11 to 12). The

266

decision to focus on these temporal windows was driven by practical reasons related to computing resources

267

required to analyse the data. In each student, the degree of Wi-Fi connection overlap was determined by

268

counting the number of unique students with whom he/she shared a Wi-Fi connection. Our analyses focused on

269

the top 100 students per day with the greatest degree of overlap with their peers because we expected this

270

group would illustrate best the impact of e-learning on individual student networks. This student group size

271

was also practical for visualising effects of e-learning on student network structure, which was performed using

272

the “igraph” package33 (version 1.2.5) with the force-directed layout algorithm (layout_with_fr) in the R

273

software environment.

Student clustering behaviour on school days was modelled as a function of daily student population size
using a power law scaling equation: 𝑦𝑦 = 𝑎𝑎𝑁𝑁𝛽𝛽 . In this equation, 𝑦𝑦 is the measure of student mixing (e.g.,

number of Wi-Fi access points with a student cluster, duration of student clustering, or pairs of students with

278

Wi-Fi connection overlap); 𝑎𝑎 is a constant; 𝑁𝑁 is the daily population size estimated by the number of students

279

who connected to the NUS Wi-Fi network; and the exponent 𝛽𝛽 reflects the underlying dynamics (e.g.,

hierarchical structure, social networks, and infrastructure) of the university ecosystem. We considered other

280

mathematical functions, including exponential and hyperbolic equations, but they did not fit as well to the data.

281

Variables that show power law scaling are linearly related when each variable is logarithmically transformed.

282

We therefore took the natural logarithm of each pair of variables (i.e., the student mixing variable and daily

283

population size) and performed linear regression to confirm the expected linear relationship. The coefficient of

284

determination (R2 value) was used to evaluate goodness-of-fit for the regression model. Modelling and

285

regression analyses were performed using Sigmaplot software (Version 14; Systat Software, Inc) and R

286

statistical software.

Fig. 1. E-learning interventions decreased the number of students detected on campus during the COVID-19
outbreak. (a) The timeline of COVID-19 cases in Singapore is shown for the second semester of the 2019/20 school
year at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Each e-learning intervention was associated with a decrease in the
daily number of students who connected to the NUS Wi-Fi network, assessed (b) campus-wide and (c) for different types
of locations on campus. (d) The daily percentage of students detected by Wi-Fi was about two-fold greater in students
with at least one class conducted by in-class learning, as compared with students with e-learning only or no scheduled
class. In panels c and d, open circles indicate non-class days. COVID-19, Coronavirus Disease 2019; WHO, World

Fig. 2. E-learning interventions reduced student clustering during the COVID-19 outbreak. Each e-learning
intervention was associated with (a) a decrease in the daily rhythm in students detected on campus, and (b) a flattening in
the daily time course of locations with >25 students connected to the same Wi-Fi access point. E-learning measures
during the disease outbreak (2019/20 school year) were effective at decreasing (c) the daily number of Wi-Fi locations
with a student cluster, and (d) the duration of clustering at these sites, as compared with the prior academic year with
normal in-class learning (2018/19 school year). (e) The daily duration of student clustering in campus buildings
decreased as more stringent e-learning policies were implemented. In panels a and b, the daily mean ± 95% CI is shown
for different parts of the semester. In panels c and d, open circles indicate non-class days. In panel e, buildings are colorcoded by the daily average of clustering duration. Buildings with missing or incomplete Wi-Fi data are coloured grey.

Fig. 3. E-learning interventions reduced the number of pairs of students with spatiotemporal overlap during the
COVID-19 outbreak. (a) Each e-learning intervention was associated with a decrease in the daily number of unique
pairs of students who connected simultaneously to the same Wi-Fi access point. In the top 100 students per day with the
greatest degree of Wi-Fi connection overlap with their peers, e-learning interventions were associated with (b) a decrease
in the number of students with whom they shared overlap, and (c) a sparser student network structure. In panels a and b,
results are plotted for different durations of Wi-Fi connection overlap between students. In panel b, the mean ± 95% CI is
shown for each group of 100 students. In panel c, the size of each circle relates to the daily duration of time connected to
Wi-Fi. The thickness of the orange lines corresponds to the duration of spatiotemporal overlap between pairs of students.
Data in the network plots correspond to Mondays for each of the representative weeks with different e-learning policies.

Fig. 4. Student clustering showed power law scaling with the number of students on campus. Student mixing
showed accelerated growth with daily population size, including (a) the number of Wi-Fi locations with a student cluster,
(b) the duration of student clustering, (c) the number of unique pairs of students who connected to the same Wi-Fi access
point, and (d) the degree of spatiotemporal overlap among the top 100 students per day who overlapped most with their
peers. Data are shown for the second semester of the 2019/20 school year during the COVID-19 outbreak. Each dataset
was fitted with a power law function, with β representing the scaling exponent. Insets show results for linear regression
after taking the natural logarithm of each variable. Circle colours correspond to different parts of the semester with
normal in-class learning (green), e-learning for classes with >50 students (red), e-learning for classes with >25 students
(blue), and e-learning for all classes (orange). In panels a and b, open circles indicate non-class days.

Extended Data Fig. 1

Extended Data Fig. 1. Students detected on campus during normal university operations. Data are shown for the
second semester of the 2018/19 school year at the National University of Singapore (NUS), assessed one year before the
COVID-19 outbreak. The number of students per day who connected to the NUS Wi-Fi network is shown for (a) the
entire campus and (b) different types of locations on campus. (c) The daily percentage of students detected by Wi-Fi was
about two-fold greater in students with in-class learning versus no scheduled class. In panels b and c, open circles
indicate non-class days.

Extended Data Fig. 2. Class size characteristics at the National University of Singapore (NUS). (a) The distribution
of class sizes is shown for the second semester of the 2019/20 school year in which the COVID-19 outbreak occurred.
Class sizes were categorized as small (green; ≤25 students), medium (blue; >25 to ≤50 students), or large (red; >50
students). (b) The combined student enrolment in medium and large classes was greater than enrolment in small classes.
(c) The cumulative distribution plot shows the number of students whose smallest class of the day exceeded a given class
size threshold. The black trace with shaded grey lines shows the daily mean and range. The red dropline shows that the
transition to e-learning for classes with >50 students resulted in about 5,000 students per day who had classes delivered
only by e-learning. The blue dropline shows that the transition to e-learning for classes with >25 students resulted in
about 9,000 students per day who had classes delivered only by e-learning. When all classes were shifted to e-learning
there were about 18,000 students per day taking their classes online.

Extended Data Fig. 3. The daily number of students detected on campus was predicted by the number of students
with in-class learning. Data are shown for the second semester of the 2019/20 school year at the National University of
Singapore (NUS) during the COVID-19 outbreak. The number of students per day who connected to the NUS Wi-Fi
network is plotted against the daily number of students who had at least one class session that took place on campus.
Circle colours correspond to different parts of the semester with normal in-class learning (green), e-learning for classes
with >50 students (red), e-learning for classes with >25 students (blue), and e-learning for all classes (orange). The solid
black trace shows the best-fit linear regression model, and the dashed black trace is the unity line.

Extended Data Fig. 4. Campus-wide detection of students at different Wi-Fi access points at the National
University of Singapore (NUS). The daily peak in the number of students who connected to each Wi-Fi access point is
shown for (a) the second semester of the 2018/19 school year, and (b) the second semester of the 2019/20 school year in
which the COVID-19 outbreak occurred. Each peak value corresponds to largest number of students per day detected at a
given Wi-Fi access point over a 15-min period. Each row in the heat map represents a different Wi-Fi access point with
green and magenta colours indicating the number of students who were detected.

Extended Data Fig. 5. Distribution of student clustering across Wi-Fi access points at the National University of
Singapore (NUS). The cumulative duration of student clustering (>25 students connected to the same Wi-Fi access
point) is shown for (a) the second semester of the 2018/19 school year, and (b) the second semester of the 2019/20
school year in which the COVID-19 outbreak occurred. Data are plotted for Wi-Fi access points with at least one student
cluster detected during the semester (785 out of 6,573 locations in 2018/19; 564 out of 6,313 locations in 2019/20). Wi-Fi
access points in each plot are ordered from left to right by the cumulative duration of student clustering over the entire
semester.

Extended Data Fig. 6

Extended Data Fig. 6. Student clustering showed power law scaling with the number of students on campus.
Students’ Wi-Fi connection data were analysed for the second semester of the 2018/19 school year and compared with
the second semester of the 2019/20 school year in which the COVID-19 outbreak occurred. In both semesters, student
clustering behaviour showed accelerated growth with increasing number of students detected on campus, including (a)
the number of Wi-Fi locations with a student cluster (>25 students connected to the same Wi-Fi access point), and (b) the
duration of student clustering at these locations. Each dataset was fitted with a power law function, with β representing
the scaling exponent. Insets show results for linear regression after taking the natural logarithm of each variable for the
2018/19 school year. Filled circles show school days and open circles indicate non-class days.

Extended Data Fig. 7. Student clustering at different campus locations showed power law scaling with the number
of students detected on campus. Data are shown for the second semester of the 2019/20 school year at the National
University of Singapore (NUS) during the COVID-19 outbreak. In both (a) teaching facilities and (b) non-teaching
facilities, the number of Wi-Fi locations with >25 students (left panels) and the duration of clustering behaviour (right
panels) showed accelerated growth with increasing number of students detected on campus. Each dataset was fitted with
a power law function, with β representing the scaling exponent. Insets show results for linear regression after taking the
natural logarithm of each variable. Circle colours correspond to different parts of the semester with normal in-class
learning (green), e-learning for classes with >50 students (red), e-learning for classes with >25 students (blue), and elearning for all classes (orange). Open circles indicate non-class days.

Extended Data Fig. 8. Power law scaling of different student cluster sizes with number of students detected on
campus. Data are shown for the second semester of the 2019/20 school year at the National University of Singapore
(NUS) during the COVID-19 outbreak. Different definitions of a student cluster were tested ranging from >5 to >50
students detected at the same Wi-Fi access point. For all cluster sizes, student clustering behaviour showed accelerated
growth with increasing number of students detected on campus, including (a) the number of Wi-Fi locations with a
student cluster, and (b) the duration of student clustering at these locations. Each dataset was fitted with a power law
function, with β representing the scaling exponent. Insets show results for linear regression after taking the natural
