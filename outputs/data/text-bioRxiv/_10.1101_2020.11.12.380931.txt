Abstract

24

The unprecedented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by

25

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a serious threat to

26

global public health. Development of effective therapies against SARS-CoV-2 is

27

urgently needed. Here, we evaluated the antiviral activity of a remdesivir parent

28

nucleotide analog, GS441524, which targets the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA

29

polymerase enzyme, and a feline coronavirus prodrug, GC376, which targets its main

30

protease, using a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 infected mouse model. Our results

31

showed that GS441524 effectively blocked the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in the

32

mouse upper and lower respiratory tracts via combined intranasal (i.n.) and

33

intramuscular (i.m.) treatment. However, the ability of high-dose GC376 (i.m. or i.n.

34

and i.m.) was weaker than GS441524. Notably, low-dose combined application of

35

GS441524 with GC376 could effectively protect mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection

36

via i.n. or i.n. and i.m. treatment. Moreover, we found that the pharmacokinetic

37

properties of GS441524 is better than GC376, and combined application of GC376

38

and GS441524 had a synergistic effect. Our findings support the further evaluation of

39

the combined application of GC376 and GS441524 in future clinical studies.

for the first time. Our results showed that low-dose combined application of GC376

and GS441524 could effectively protect mice from HRB26M infection in the upper

Introduction

51

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes

52

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which spread rapidly to more than 235

53

countries. The number of infections has exceeded 40 million, and more than 1 million

54

deaths

55

(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019).

56

Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global health emergency.

57

Multiple vaccine candidates and therapeutics are in clinical trials (1-6), and effective

58

treatments or cures for COVID-19 are still urgently needed.

59

Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses, and

60

their genomic RNA is approximately 30 kb and contains at least 6 open reading

61

frames (ORFs) (7). The first ORF (ORF 1a/b) encodes two polyproteins, pp1a and

62

pp1ab, and these polyproteins are processed via a main protease (Mpro, also known as

63

the 3C-like protease) and one or two papain-like proteases (PLPs) into 16

64

nonstructural proteins (nsps) (8, 9). These nsps engage in the production of

65

subgenomic RNAs that encode four main structural proteins [envelope (E), membrane

66

(M), spike (S), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins] and other accessory proteins (8, 9).

67

Among these nsps, Mpro and nsp12 (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 are functionally and

68

structurally conserved among these viruses and essential for viral replication; they are

69

considered a potential target for the design of antiviral drugs (10-16).

70

GC376, a dipeptidyl bisulfite adduct salt, exerts strong inhibitory effects on

71

picornaviruses and coronaviruses (11, 14, 15, 17). The latest research has shown that

72

GC376 can also inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells (12, 13, 16).

73

Moreover, antiviral treatment with GC376 led to a full recovery in laboratory cats

74

with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) caused by feline coronavirus (FIPV) (18).

75

Currently, no studies have evaluated the ability of GC376 to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in

76

animals. In addition, remdesivir (RDV) and its parent nucleoside analog GS-441524

77

inhibit CoVs and other viruses (19-22). The latest research also suggests that RDV

78

inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in vivo and in vitro (10, 23-27). However, recent research

79

showed that RDV was not intended for lung-specific delivery, and GS-441524 is the

80

predominant metabolite that reaches the lungs, which suggests that GS-441524 is

81

superior to RDV for COVID-19 treatment (28, 29).

82

Because GC376 and GS441524 target the key proteases Mpro and RdRp of

83

SARS-CoV-2 replication, respectively, their combined application may be more

84

effective in the treatment of COVID-19. The combined application of GC376 with

85

RDV produced additive sterilizing additive effects against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6

86

cells (13). However, the efficacy of the combined application of GC376 and

87

GS441524 in the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication was not investigated in vivo

88

and in vitro. Our team generated a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (HRB26M) that

efficiently replicates in the upper and lower respiratory tract in BALB/c mice (4, 30).

90

Hence, we assessed the antiviral efficacy of GC376 and GS441524 in an

91

HRB26M-infected BALB/c mouse model. Our results showed that GC376, which

92

effectively inhibited the virus at the cellular level, was less effective in vivo. The

93

ability of GS441524 to block the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 was significantly

94

higher than GC376 in mice. Notably, the low-dose combined application of GC376

95

and GS441524 could effectively block SARS-CoV-2 infection in the mouse upper and

96

lower respiratory tract.

Results and Discussion

98

Structural analysis of GC376 and GS441524 targeting SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and

99

nsp12 (RdRp)

100

In this study, we first analyzed the mechanism by which GC376 and GS441524

101

inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication through structural biology methods. GC376 (Fig. 1a)

102

is a preclinical inhibitor against feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) (31) that has

103

become a broad-spectrum prodrug targeting coronavirus Mpro (14, 32, 33). We

104

determined the high-resolution crystal complex structure of Mpro with GC376 at a

105

resolution of 2.35 Ã… (Table S1). The crystal of Mpro-GC376 belongs to the space

106

group P1211, and an asymmetric unit contains two molecules (designated protomer A

107

and protomer B) (Fig. 1b). The structure of each protomer contains three domains

108

with the substrate-binding site comprised of a His41-Cys145 dyad located in the cleft

109

between domain I and II (Supplementary Fig. 1). The electron density map clearly

110

showed compound GC376 in the substrate binding pocket of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro,

111

and details of the interaction are shown in Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1. GC376

112

interacts with His41, Phe140, Leu141, Asn142, Ser144, Cys145, His163, His164,

113

Met165, Glu166, His172, Asp187, Arg188 and Gln189 through many hydrogen bonds

114

and hydrophobic interactions, and binds stably in the groove formed by domain I and

115

domain II. Moreover, we found that GC376 is covalently attached to Cys145 as a

116

hemithioacetal (Fig. 1c), which prevents the binding and processing of Mpro to the

117

substrate (12, 16, 32). Additionally, GS441524 is the parent nucleoside of RDV (Fig.

118

1d and Supplementary Fig. 2a), and has shown broad-spectrum inhibition of the

119

replication of various coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (28, 34, 35). Since the

120

mechanism by which GS441524 inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication is similar to that of

121

RDV (28, 34), we showed the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) ternary structure

122

of the complex with RDV (PDB: 7BV2) (10). Previous studies have shown that RDV,

123

like many nucleotide analog prodrugs, inhibits viral RdRp activity through

124

nonobligate RNA chain termination (10, 36, 37). Moreover, we observed that RDV

125

stably bound nsp12 through hydrophobic interactions with Arg555, Asp623, Ser682,

126

Thr687 and Asp760 (Fig. 1e, f and Supplementary Fig. 2b).

127

Combined application of GC376 and GS441524 has an enhanced ability to

128

inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells

129

We evaluated the inhibitory efficacy of GC376, GS441524 and the combined

130

application of GC376 and GS441524 (molar ratio: 1:1) (GC376+GS441524) on the

131

replication of live virus (SARS-CoV-2: HRB26 and HRB26M) in Vero E6 cells. We

132

first tested the cellular cytotoxicity of these compounds in vitro. GC376 and

133

GS441524 did not produce obvious cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 250 Î¼M in

134

Vero E6 cells (CC50ï¹¥250 Î¼M; Supplementary Fig. 3). Our results showed that

135

GC376 and GS441524 were efficacious against HRB26, with 50% inhibitory

136

concentration (EC50) values of 0.643Â±0.085 Î¼M and 5.188Â±2.476 Î¼M, respectively

137

(Fig. 2a, b). GC376 and GS441524 were also efficacious against HRB26M, with

138

EC50 values of 0.881Â±0.109 Î¼M and 5.047Â±2.116 Î¼M, respectively (Fig. 2d, e). Our

139

results showed that the ability of GC376 to inhibit viral (HRB26 and HRB26M)

140

replication was better than GS441524 when the agents were applied alone. We

141

observed that the GC376+GS441524 more effectively inhibited HRB26 and

142

HRB26M replication than single treatment, with EC50 values of 0.531Â±0.162 Î¼M and

143

0.369Â±0.068 Î¼M, respectively (Fig. 2c, f). In the replication process of coronavirus,

144

Mpro is one of the first nsps processed by the polyprotein, and other replication-related

145

proteins, such as RdRp, can be produced with the participation of Mpro and PLP

146

proteases (8, 9). This phenomenon may be the reason why GC376 is better than

147

GS441524, and their combined application may result in a synergistic effect because

148

these agents target different proteins involved in virus replication.

149

Low-dose GC376+GS441524 could effectively protect mice from HRB26M

150

infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts

151

The potential toxicity of GC376, GS441524 and GC376+GS441524 were

152

evaluated in healthy specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice at 4-6 weeks. The mice were

153

intramuscularly (i.m.) administered GC376 (40 mM/l, 100 Âµl), GS441524 (40 mM/l,

154

100 Âµl) and GC376+GS441524 (20 mM/l, 100 Âµl) for 15 days, and they were

155

observed daily for adverse effects. During the study period, there were no clinically

156

significant changes in vital signs or clinical laboratory parameters (Supplementary

157

Fig. 4), indicating that the dose and administration route of GC376, GS441524 and

158

GC376+GS441524 were suitable for the in vivo efficacy study.

159

We assessed the antiviral efficacy of i.m. administered GC376 (40 or 8 mM/l,

160

100 Âµl), GS441524 (40 or 8 mM/l, 100 Âµl) and GC376+GS441524 (20 or 4 mM/l, 100

161

Âµl) against SARS-CoV-2 in mice. In the compound-treated group, the viral RNA and

162

viral titer were detected in the nasal turbinates and lungs on days 3 and 5

163

post-inoculation (p.i.); the viral RNA loads and viral titer in the nasal turbinates were

164

not significantly decreased compared with those in the mock-treated mice on day 3 p.i

165

(Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). Although no significant decreases in

166

viral RNA loads were observed, high-dose GC376+GS441524 significantly inhibited

167

the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the turbinate on day 5 p.i. (Fig. 3c, d and

168

Supplementary Fig. 5c, d). Our results showed that high-dose GS441524 and

169

GC376+GS441524 completely inhibited the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in mouse

170

lungs on days 3 and 5 p.i. (Fig. 3e, f, g, h and Supplementary Fig. 6). Besides, the

171

virus yields in the lungs of the high-dose GC376-treated group were significantly

172

reduced compared to mock-treated mice on day 5 p.i., but it could not completely

173

block the viral proliferation (Fig. 3h and Supplementary Fig. 6d). Additionally, the

174

ability of the low-dose compound-treated group to inhibit viral replication was lower

175

than the high-dose group in the lungs (Fig. 3e, f, g, h and Supplementary Fig. 6).

Similar to RDV (30), high-dose GS441524 and GC376+GS441524 completely

177

blocked the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in mouse lungs, but these agents failed to

178

block virus proliferation in the upper respiratory turbinate on day 5 p.i. These data

179

indicated that high-dose i.m. compound treatment (excluding GC376) efficiently

180

inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs, but not in the nasal turbinates

181

of BALB/c mice.

182

Furthermore, we assessed whether intranasal (i.n.) administration would improve

183

the efficacy of GC376 and GS441524 to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the

184

upper respiratory tract. Mice were treated with GC376 (i.n. and i.n.+i.m.), GS441524

185

(i.n. and i.n.+i.m.) and GC376+GS441524 (i.n. and i.n.+i.m.). Our results showed that

186

GS441524 and GC376+GS441524 markedly inhibited viral replication in nasal

187

turbinates on days 3 and 5 p.i. (Fig. 4b, d and Supplementary Fig. 7b, d). Only

188

slightly infectious virus was detected on day 5 p.i., although viral RNA was detected

189

in 2 of the 3 mice in the GS441524-treated group (Fig. 4c, d and Supplementary Fig.

190

7c, d). However, i.n. administration of GS441524 did not significantly inhibit viral

191

replication in the lungs compared to that of the mock-treated group on day 5 p.i (Fig.

192

4g, h and Supplementary Fig. 8c, d). Notably, we observed that i.n. administration

193

of GC376+GS441524 blocked viral replication in the lungs on day 5 p.i., although

194

viral RNA was detected in 1 of the 3 mice (Fig. 4 g, h and Supplementary Fig. 8 c,

195

d). GS441524 treatment via i.n. and i.m. routes completely blocked viral replication

196

in the nasal turbinates and lungs, although viral RNAs were detected from the nasal

197

turbinates of 2 of the 3 mice on day 3 p.i (reduced approximately 700-fold compared

198

to that of the mock-treated group) (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8).

199

Similarly, low-dose GC376+GS441524 treatment (i.n.+ i.m.) also completely blocked

200

viral replication in the nasal turbinates and lungs, although viral RNAs were detected

201

from the nasal turbinates of 2 of the 3 mice on day 3 p.i. and 5 p.i. (reduced

202

approximately 1500-fold and 263-fold compared to that of the mock-treated group,

203

respectively) (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). Although GC376 treatment

204

via the i.n. or combined i.n. and i.m. routes reduced the level of virus replication on

205

day 5 p.i (Supplementary Figs. 7d and 8d), it did not completely blocked viral

206

replication in nasal turbinates and lungs (Fig. 4).

207

Pharmacokinetics study of GC376 and GS441524 alone or in combination

208

To further examine the potential of GC376 and GS441524, we evaluated their

209

pharmacokinetic (PK) properties in SPF SD rats following i.m. administration of

210

GC376 (111 mg/kg), GS441524 (67 mg/kg) and GC376+GS441524 (55.5+33.5

211

mg/kg), which are the same doses used in mice according to weight. The PK results

212

showed that GC376 and GS441524 were rapidly absorbed after i.m. administration,

213

and the peak plasma level was reached 1.30Â±0.60 h and 2.00Â±1.10 h after injection,

214

respectively (Fig. 5 and Table 1). Our results are consistent with the previously

215

reported Tmax of GS441524 in patients (29) and GC376 in cats (18). We found that the

216

maximum detected plasma drug concentration (Cmax) of GC376 (12.56Â±1.90 Î¼g/ml)

217

was approximately 2.5-fold lower than GS441524 (30.96Â±8.40 Î¼g/ml) (Table 1). The

218

value of the area under the curve (AUC0-t) of GS441524 (AUC0-t=183.33Â±64.36) was

219

approximately 2.0-fold higher than GC376 (AUC0-t=92.14Â±9.99). However, the i.m.

220

administered dose of GC376 was approximately 1.7-fold that of GS441524. We

221

observed that the clearance rate of GC376 (CL/F, 1208Â±122 ml/h/kg) in plasma was

222

approximately 2.9-fold that of GS441524 (CL/F, 423Â±186 ml/h/kg) (Table 1). These

223

results indicated that the utilization efficiency of GS441524 in vivo is significantly

224

higher than that of GC376. This finding may be one of the reasons for the poor ability

225

of GC376 to inhibit SARS-CV-2 in vivo. In addition, current research has shown that

226

GC376 can effectively eliminate FIPV in cats (18). However, this drug could not

227

effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the upper and lower respiratory tracts in mice. One

228

possible explanation is that GC376 may have difficulty reaching the mouse nasal

229

turbinates and lungs, and the specific mechanism needs further study.

230

Furthermore, we found that the combined application of GC376 and GS441524

231

had a synergistic effect and extended T1/2 from 3.80Â±1.17 h to 5.13Â±2.56 h, Tmax from

232

2.00Â±1.10 h to 3.40Â±1.20 h and the residence time of GS441524 (MRT0-t from

233

4.50Â±1.11 h to 6.03Â±1.37 h) (Fig. 5c and Table 1). However, the injection dose was

234

halved because the clearance rate was not changed, and the MRT0-t of GC376

235

decreased from 5.80Â±0.74 h to 2.97Â±0.41 h. The PK study results showed that GC376

236

reached Cmax earlier (Tmax=1.40Â±0.49) than GS441524 (Tmax=3.40Â±1.20 h) to produce

237

a synergistic effect (Fig. 5c). When these agents were combined, GC376 was the first

238

drug to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. After the plasma concentration of GC376

239

decreased, GS441524 reached its Cmax (Fig. 5c and Table1) to produce a continuous

242

and GS441524 was better than single application alone. In addition, the difference in

243

the pharmacokinetics of GC376 and GS441524 between the upper and lower

244

respiratory tract needs to be further evaluated.

245

In summary, we assessed the efficacy of GC376 and GS441524 to inhibit

246

SARS-CoV-2 replication using a mouse-adapted virus infection model. Importantly,

247

we found that intranasal administration of GS441524 and GC376+GS441524

248

significantly prevents the replication of virus in the upper respiratory tract, and the

249

efficacy of GC376+GS441524 to inhibit the viral replication in the lower respiratory

250

tract significantly better than that of GS441524. Combined i.n. and i.m. administration

251

of GS441524 and GC376+GS441524 effectively protected mice against HRB26M

252

infection in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, but GC376 alone failed to block

253

the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 in mice. Compared with GC376 and GS441524

254

alone, the dosage of GC376+GS441524 is halved, these results showed an additive

255

effect of the combined application of the Mpro and RdRp inhibitors, so it should be

256

developed and considered for future clinic practice.

281

were cultured at 37Â°C in LB medium containing 50 Î¼g/ml ampicillin. Protein

282

expression was induced with 0.8 mM isopropyl Î²-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)

283

when the culture density reached an OD600 of 0.8, and cell growth continued for an

284

additional 16 h at 18Â°C. Protein purification was performed as described previously

287

elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl and 500 mM imidazole, pH 7.4).

288

Then, the harvested protein was concentrated to approximately 2.0 ml and filtered

289

using a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer

290

(20 mM Tris-HCl and 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). For crystallization, the purified protein

291

was concentrated to approximately 8 mg/ml, flash frozen with liquid nitrogen, and

292

stored at -80Â°C. The concentration of purified SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was determined by

293

the absorbance at 280 nm (A280) using a NanoDrop 2000c UV-Vis spectrophotometer

294

(Thermo Fisher Scientific).

295

Crystallization, data collection and structure determination

296

GC376 and Mpro (8 mg/ml) were incubated at room temperature for 1 h (molar

297

ratio: 1:2), and the complex was crystallized by the hanging drop vapor diffusion

298

method at 20Â°C. The best crystallization conditions for the complex were in hanging

299

drops consisting of 2 Î¼l of reservoir solution (0.1 M sodium malonate pH 6.0, 12%

300

w/v polyethylene glycol 3,350) and 2 Î¼l of the complex in 20 mM Tris-HCl and 200

301

mM NaCl, pH 7.4, followed by incubation at 20Â°C for 3 days. Then, the crystals were

302

flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen in a cryoprotectant solution containing 30% ethylene

303

glycol and 70% reservoir solution (0.1 M sodium malonate pH 6.0, 14% w/v

304

polyethylene glycol 3,350). Data collection was performed at the research associates

305

at Center for Protein Research (CPR), Huazhong Agricultural University (wavelength

306

= 1.5418 Ã…, temperature = 100 K). Reflections were integrated, merged, and scaled

Evaluation of antiviral activity in Vero E6 cells

314

Cell viability was determined using the Cell Titer-Glo kit (Promega, Madison,

315

WI, USA) following the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Briefly, Vero E6 cells were

316

seeded in 96-well plates with opaque walls. After 12 to 16 h, the indicated

317

concentrations of GC376 (0, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 ÂµM), GS441524 (0, 1, 5, 10, 50,

318

100, 500 ÂµM) and GC376+GS441524 (0, 0.5, 2.5, 5, 25, 50, 250ÂµM) were added for

319

24h. Cell Titer-Glo reagent was added to each well, and luminescence was measured

320

using a GloMax 96 Microplate Luminometer (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).

321

Antiviral activity experiment was determined following a previous method (30).

322

Briefly, Vero E6 cells were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of GC376 (0,

323

0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ÂµM), GS441524 (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ÂµM) and

324

GC376+GS441524 (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ÂµM) or with vehicle solution (12%

325

sulfobutylether-Î²-cyclodextrin, pH 3.5) alone for 1 h. The cells were then infected

326

with HRB26 or HRB26M at an MOI of 0.005 and incubated for 1 h at 37Â°C. The cells

327

were washed with PBS, and virus growth medium containing the indicated amounts

328

of GC376, GS441524 and GC376+GS441524 or vehicle solution alone was added.

329

The supernatants were collected at 24 h p.i. for viral titration by a PFU assay in Vero

333

independent experiments.

334

In vivo toxicity study of GC376 and GS441524

335

The toxicity studies were performed in 4- to 6-week-old female BALB/c mice.

336

BALB/c mice were assigned to four groups (five mice per group), one mock group

337

(i.m. administration of solvent) and three i.m. administered groups: GC376 (40 mM/l,

338

100 Âµl), GS441524 (40 mM/l, 100 Âµl) and GC376+GS441524 (20 mM/l, 100 Âµl),

339

respectively. Mice in the mock and experimental groups were weighed daily for 15

340

days. In addition, blood samples were collected at 0, 5, 10 and 15 days after

341

administration. Various blood chemistry values or blood cell counts were performed at

342

Wuhan Servicebio Biological Technology Co., Ltd. The data were analyzed using

343

GraphPad Prism 7.0.

344

In vivo antiviral study of GC376 and GS441524

345

Firstly, groups of six 4- to 6-week-old female mice were treated i.m. with a

346

loading dose of GC376 (40 or 8 mM/l, 100 Âµl), GS441524 (40 or 8 mM/l, 100 Âµl) and

347

GC376+GS441524 (20 or 4 mM/l, 100 Âµl), followed by a daily maintenance dose.

348

Alternatively, mice were treated intranasally with a single treatment (GC376, 20 mM/l,

349

50 Âµl; GS441524, 20 mM/l, 50 Âµl; GC376+GS441524, 10 mM/l, 50 Âµl) or a

350

combination of GC376 (20 mM/l, 50 Âµl, i.n. and 40 mM/l, 100 Âµl, i.m.), GS441524

351

(20 mM/l, 50 Âµl, i.n. and 40 mM/l, 100 Âµl, i.m.) and GC376+GS441524 (10 mM/l,

352

50Âµl, i.n. and 20 mM/l, 100 Âµl, i.m.), followed by a daily maintenance dose. As a

control, mice were administered vehicle solution (12% sulfobutylether-Î²-cyclodextrin,

354

pH 3.5) daily. One hour after administration of the loading dose of GC376, GS441524

355

and GC376+GS441524 or vehicle solution, each mouse was inoculated intranasally

356

with103.6 PFU of HRB26M in 50 Î¼l. Three mice from each group were euthanized on

357

days 3 and 5 p.i. The nasal turbinates and lungs were collected for viral detection by

358

qPCR and PFU assay according to previously described methods (4, 30). The amount

359

of vRNA for the target SARS-CoV-2 N gene was normalized to the standard curve

360

from a plasmid (pBluescript II SK-N, 4,221 bp) containing the full-length cDNA of

361

the SARS-CoV-2 N gene. The assay sensitivity was 1000 copies/ml. The data were

362

analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2016 and GraphPad Prism 7.0.

363

Pharmacokinetics study of GC376 and GS441524 in SD rats

364

Five healthy SPF SD rats of 4-6 weeks were used in a single-dose PK study. At

365

time point zero, the SD rats of groups A, B and C received i.m. injections of GC376

366

(111 mg/kg), GS441524 (67 mg/kg) and GC376+GS441524 (55.5+33.5 mg/kg),

367

which are the same doses used in mice according to weight. Approximately 200Âµl of

368

blood was collected at 0, 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h from the tail vein

369

and placed in a precooled polypropylene centrifuge tube containing 3.0 Âµl of 40%

370

EDTAK2. Then, the whole blood was centrifuged at 7800 g/min for 10 min at 4â„ƒ.

371

Plasma was collected and stored in a freezer at -80Â°C. Plasma drug concentration was

372

analyzed

373

Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using WinNonlin software (version 6.4),

374

and a non-atrioventricular model was used for data fitting. The data were analyzed
