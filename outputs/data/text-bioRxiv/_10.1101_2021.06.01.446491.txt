Abstract

Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have shown efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, it is
unclear if they can also protect against other coronaviruses that may infect
humans in the future. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in humans
elicits cross-reactive antibodies against other coronaviruses. Our studies in mice
demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 vaccination protects against a common cold
coronavirus, and that SARS-CoV-1 vaccination protects against SARS-CoV-2.
Similarly, infection with a common cold coronavirus also conferred enhanced
protection from subsequent infections with other coronaviruses. Mechanistically,
both T cells and antibodies mediated cross-protection. This is the first direct
demonstration that coronavirus-specific immunity can confer heterologous
protection in vivo, providing a rationale for universal coronavirus vaccines.

Introduction

Coronaviruses have garnered attention for their potential to cause pandemics. In
less than 20 years, there have been outbreaks from at least three
betacoronaviruses: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome associated coronavirus
(SARS-CoV-1), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS), and
recently, SARS-CoV-2. Multiple SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have shown efficacy at
preventing COVID-19, but whether they confer protection to other coronaviruses
is unknown. It also remains unclear if infection with endemic coronaviruses
confers protection against other coronaviruses. To answer these questions, we
evaluated cross-protective immunity following coronavirus vaccination and
coronavirus infection.

SARS-CoV-2 vaccines induce cross-reactive antibody responses against
other coronaviruses in humans

We first measured antibody responses following vaccination of humans with
SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (Pfizer/BioNTek, Moderna and J&J). Plasma samples
from human volunteers were obtained before vaccination, and at several time
points after vaccination. As expected, vaccination of humans with SARS-CoV-2
vaccines resulted in increase in SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies (Fig. 1A).
Importantly, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines also induced an increase in SARS-CoV-1
spike-specific antibody (Fig. 1B). We also quantified antibody responses against
the spike protein of OC43, which is an endemic coronavirus that causes common
colds in humans. All patients had high levels of pre-existing antibody titers
against OC43, but SARS-CoV-2 vaccination increased antibody titers against this
endemic coronavirus (Fig. 1C). We then segregated our data, separating people
who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 prior to vaccination from those who were
not previously infected. Consistent with prior reports1,2, a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine
prime induced a substantial increase in SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody in people
who were previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1D). A similar pattern was
observed for SARS-CoV-1-specific antibody (Fig. 1E). Antibody responses to the
more distant OC43 coronavirus were not increased further by the booster
vaccine in unexposed individuals, and were higher in people who were previously
infected (Fig. 1F). Taken together, these data showed that SARS-CoV-2

vaccination elicited cross-reactive antibody responses that were specific to other
coronaviruses besides SARS-CoV-2.

COVID-19 patients show cross-reactive antibody responses against other
coronaviruses

We then interrogated if cross-reactive antibodies could also be observed in
COVID-19 patients. We compared antibody responses in plasma from PCRconfirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to the Northwestern Memorial Hospital,
as well as healthy control plasma harvested before 2019. COVID-19 patients
showed higher levels of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies (Fig. 2A), as well
as SARS-CoV-1 spike-specific (Fig. 2B) and OC43-specific (Fig. 2C) antibodies,
relative to control individuals. These data demonstrate that COVID-19 patients
develop cross-reactive antibody responses that recognize other coronaviruses.

Characterization of cross-reactive antibody responses with multiple SARSCoV-2 vaccine modalities

Our experiments above showed that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines induce antibody
responses against heterologous coronaviruses in humans. We then interrogated
whether this effect was generalizable to other vaccine platforms that have been
used in humans. We primed C57BL/6 mice intramuscularly with various SARSCoV-2 vaccines, including adenovirus-based, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)

based, mRNA-based, RBD protein-based, spike protein-based, and inactivated
virus-based vaccines. We boosted mice at approximately 3 weeks, and
evaluated antibody responses at 2 weeks post-boost.

Consistent with our data in humans, vaccination of mice with an adenovirus
vector expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (Ad5-SARS-2 spike) resulted in potent
antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, and a more modest
but statistically significant increase in antibody responses against more distant
coronaviruses, including OC43 and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-1) (Fig. 3A).
Cross-reactive antibody responses were also elicited by VSV-based, mRNAbased, RBD protein-based, spike protein-based, and inactivated virus-based
vaccines (Fig. 3B-3F). Altogether, these data showed that multiple SARS-CoV-2
vaccine platforms are able to elicit cross-reactive antibody responses.

We then interrogated whether a vaccine against a different SARS coronavirus
spike protein could also induce cross-reactive antibodies. Similarly, crossreactive antibodies were also observed with an experimental SARS-CoV-1 spike
vaccine developed in 2004, based on modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA-SARS-1
spike), which was previously shown to protect mice and macaques against a
SARS-CoV-1 challenge3,4 (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, sera from MVA-SARS-1vaccinated mice partially neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in vitro (Fig. 4B4D). These data show that immunization with a SARS-CoV-1 vaccine elicits

Following a viral infection, viral control is facilitated by CD8 T cells. To measure
cross-reactive CD8 T cell responses, we harvested splenocytes from mice that
received the SARS-CoV-1 vaccine, and stimulated these cells with SARS-CoV-2
spike peptides (Table S1) for 5 hr, followed by intracellular cytokine stain (ICS) to
detect cross-reactive (SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific) CD8 T cells. Interestingly, the
SARS-CoV-1 vaccine elicited SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8 T cell responses (Fig.
4E), suggesting the presence of conserved CD8 T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-1
and SARS-CoV-2. To identify cross-reactive CD8 T cell epitopes, we performed
sequence alignment (fig. S1) followed by epitope mapping. We identified two
highly conserved epitopes in the spike protein, in particular the VVLSFELL and
VNFNFNGL epitopes, which are highly conserved among other SARS-like
coronaviruses (fig. S1). These two epitopes were previously identified in a prior
study in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice5. The VNFNFNGL CD8 T cell response has
also been reported to be elicited after SARS-CoV-1 infection in C57BL/6 mice6,
and we show that it is also immunodominant after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination (fig.
S2A). Both VVLSFELL and VNFNFNGL were predicted to bind Kb by MHC-I
epitope prediction algorithms (see Materials and Methods).

We reasoned that Kb VNFNFNGL tetramers could be used to track cross-reactive
CD8 T cells following SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. The protein

vaccines and the inactivated vaccine did not generate a Kb VNFNFNGL (Kb VL8)
CD8 T cell responses (not shown), likely because CD8 T cell priming is
dependent on intracellular protein expression. However, Kb VL8 CD8 T cell
responses were observed after vaccination with MVA-based, adenovirus-based,
mRNA-based and VSV-based SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (Fig.
4F). In particular, adenovirus-based and MVA-based vaccines seemed to
generate the greatest Kb VL8 CD8 T cell response (Fig. 4F-4G).

We then performed single cell TCR-seq analyses to interrogate whether the
conserved Kb VL8 response exhibited a biased TCR usage. We show that most
of this conserved response contained a TCR composed of Vα7/Vβ11 (fig. S2BS2D). We are currently using this single cell TCR sequencing information to
develop a TCR transgenic mouse that could be used to study cross-reactive CD8
T cells among different sarbecovirus infections. Altogether, our data showed that
a SARS-CoV-1 vaccine also generates antibody and T cell responses that
recognize other coronaviruses. These data suggested that a SARS-CoV-1
vaccine could protect against heterologous coronavirus challenges, including
SARS-CoV-2.

A SARS-CoV-1 vaccine protects against a SARS-CoV-2 challenge

There are concerns about emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and whether they
could escape vaccine-elicited protection7. There are also worries that SARS-

CoV-1 may spill over again in the human population. Thus, a critical question is
whether SARS-CoV-2 vaccines could also protect against SARS-CoV-1, as well
as other coronaviruses. To answer this simple question, we performed challenge
experiments to evaluate whether coronavirus vaccines could protect against
different coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-1 is a select agent, so we were not able to
challenge SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated animals with SARS-CoV-1 in our BL3
facilities. Instead, we evaluated whether a SARS-CoV-1 vaccine could protect
against a SARS-CoV-2 challenge. We immunized mice with a SARS-CoV-1
spike vaccine (MVA-SARS-1 spike), and then challenged mice intranasally with
SARS-CoV-2. At day 5 post-challenge, we harvested lungs and measured viral
loads by PCR. Strikingly, the SARS-CoV-1 vaccine conferred a 282-fold
protection following a SARS-CoV-2 challenge (Fig. 5A). Improved control of
SARS-CoV-2 was also observed at an earlier time post-challenge (day 3) (Fig.
5A). These data demonstrate that a SARS vaccine with only a 76% matched
spike sequence could still confer robust immune protection.

Humans are constantly exposed to endemic coronaviruses. Our next question
was whether a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could confer protection against an endemic
coronavirus (OC43), which shares less than 40% identity with SARS-CoV-2. We
first immunized mice with a SARS-CoV-2 spike or nucleocapsid vaccine (both
Ad5-based), and then challenged mice intranasally with OC43. At day 5 postchallenge, we harvested lungs and measured viral loads by PCR. The SARSCoV-2 nucleocapsid vaccine (38% matched) conferred a 3.7-fold protection

following this common cold coronavirus challenge (Fig. 5B). No significant
heterologous protection was observed with the spike-based vaccine (37%
matched) (Fig. 5B). Collectively, these data demonstrate that a SARS-CoV-2
coronavirus vaccine based on the nucleocapsid antigen can confer partial
protection against a distant coronavirus challenge. In particular, the degree of
heterologous protection appeared to be proportional to the genetic similarity
between the vaccine antigen and the challenge antigen (Fig. 5A-5B).

Prior coronavirus infections confer heterologous protection against
different coronaviruses

Similar to our data with COVID-19 patients, coronavirus infections in mice also
induced cross-reactive antibody responses. In particular, a common cold
coronavirus infection elicited cross-reactive antibodies against SARS-CoV-2,
SARS-CoV-1 and MHV-1 (fig. S3A). Cross-reactive antibody was also generated
after an MHV-1 infection (fig S3B). We interrogated whether mice that had prior
coronavirus infections were protected following heterologous coronavirus
challenges. In our first model, we infected mice with the common cold
coronavirus OC43, and after 4 weeks, we challenged these mice with MHV-1
(64% spike identity; 84% complete sequence identity). Importantly, OC43immune mice exhibited a 321-fold protection against a heterologous MHV-1
challenge (Fig. 5C).

In our second model, we infected mice with MHV-1, and after 4 weeks, we
challenged them with MHV-A59. Although these 2 coronaviruses have similar
names, they are genetically distinct (81% spike identity; 92% complete sequence
identity). Interestingly, MHV-1-immune mice exhibited sterilizing immune
protection against a heterologous MHV-A59 challenge (Fig. 5D). These data
demonstrate that coronavirus infections can confer partial or full protection
against future infections with other coronaviruses. We also observed a pattern in
which the degree of heterologous protection appeared to be proportional to the
genetic similarity between the initial coronavirus and the subsequent coronavirus
infection (Fig. 5C-5D).

Mechanism: Both T cells and antibodies contribute to cross-protection

So far, we have shown that coronavirus vaccines and coronavirus infections
induce cross-reactive immune responses in mice and humans. In addition, we
showed that coronavirus vaccines and coronavirus infections confer protection
against heterologous coronavirus challenges in mice. To analyze the specific
contribution of T cells and antibody responses in cross-protection following
heterologous coronavirus challenges, we performed challenge studies that
allowed us to dissect the specific role of T cells and antibodies.

To assess the specific role of T cells, we immunized mice with a dendritic cell
(DC)-based vaccine that induces SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in the

absence of antibody responses. This DC-based vaccine was prepared by coating
DCs with short linear peptide pools derived from the SARS-CoV-2 spike,
envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid proteins (DC-SARS-2 SEMN). After a
week, mice were boosted with splenocytes coated with these same peptide
pools, followed by a heterologous MHV-1 challenge to evaluate cross-protection
(fig. S4A). This DC vaccine containing short linear peptides generated CD8 T cell
responses (fig. S4B-S4C), but not antibody responses (fig. S4D). Interestingly,
this SARS-CoV-2 T cell-based vaccine conferred robust protection against a
heterologous MHV-A59 challenge (fig. S4E).

To evaluate the specific role of antibodies, we immunized mice with a SARSCoV-1 spike vaccine, and then we harvested immune sera for adoptive transfer
studies into naïve mice, followed by MHV-A59 challenge (fig. S5A). Although
SARS-CoV-1 and MHV-A59 share only 30% identity in their spike proteins,
SARS-CoV-1 spike-immune sera conferred partial protection in wild type
recipient mice (fig. S5B) or Ifnar1-/- recipient mice (fig. S5C), which are highly
susceptible to MHV-A59. In summary, our data showed that both T cell and
antibody responses elicited by SARS coronavirus vaccination confer crossprotection against distant coronavirus challenges.

DISCUSSION

SARS-CoV-2 has caused a major pandemic resulting in numerous deaths.
Several SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been deployed for human use, but it is
unknown if these vaccines could also protect against other viruses, including
pandemic or endemic coronaviruses. In this study, we show that SARS-CoV-2
vaccination in humans elicits cross-reactive antibody against SARS-CoV-1 and
common cold coronavirus OC43. Our subsequent studies in mice demonstrate
that a SARS-CoV-1 vaccine protects against a SARS-CoV-2 challenge, and that
prior coronavirus infections can protect against subsequent infections with other
coronaviruses. In our challenge models, both T cells and antibodies were able to
mediate cross-protection.

Coronavirus vaccines has been previously shown to elicit cross-reactive
antibodies8-10, but our study is the first to show in vivo heterologous protection by
coronavirus vaccines. Our study suggests that cross-protection is proportional to
the level of genetic conservation. For example, vaccination with a SARS-CoV-1
spike vaccine confers robust protection against a SARS-CoV-2 challenge (76%
antigen-matched). On the other hand, vaccination with a SARS-CoV-2 spike
vaccine did not confer significant protection against an OC43 challenge (only
37% antigen-matched). Similarly, a positive correlation between genetic similarity
and heterologous protection were observed in the context of heterologous
coronavirus infections. Therefore, our results partly mitigate concerns that current

14

SARS-CoV-2 vaccines could become ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 variants,
which are still 99% identical to the original SARS-CoV-2.

Moreover, our data suggest that infection may confer more robust crossprotective immunity than vaccination (Fig. 5). This could be explained by the high
number of conserved antigens that are presented during a natural viral infection.
However, most coronavirus vaccines are based only on the spike antigen, which
is the least conserved protein of coronaviruses. It is possible that incorporation of
other viral antigens may be necessary to develop universal vaccines with broad
immune coverage.

Immune cross-reactivity in the context of coronavirus vaccination or coronavirus
infection is based on genetic conservation of antigen sequences. A recent study
showed that the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein contains highly conserved
amino acid sequences11. In particular, the PRWYFYYLGTGPEAGLPYG
sequence is nearly identical in bat coronaviruses, human coronaviruses (e.g.
OC43), and murine coronaviruses (e.g. MHV-A59 and MHV-1)11. Long linear
stretches of conserved amino acid sequences may facilitate the priming of crossreactive T cell responses. Additionally, the nucleocapsid is the most abundant
structural protein in the coronavirus lifecycle, which may facilitate early detection
by T cells

12-14

. These peculiar features of the nucleocapsid protein may render it

an optimal target for universal coronavirus vaccines, and may explain why in our
studies a SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid-based vaccine, but not a spike-based

vaccine, conferred partial protection against an OC43 challenge. Interestingly,
vaccination with “whole” spike protein induced higher levels of cross-reactive
antibody, relative to vaccination with RBD protein (Fig. 3D-3E). This is likely due
to the high number of conserved epitopes in the “whole” spike protein.

Prior studies have shown that recent endemic coronavirus infections in humans
are associated with less severe COVID-1915. In particular, young individuals
show higher pre-existing immunity against seasonal coronaviruses, and this has
been proposed to explain their improved clinical outcomes following SARS-CoV2 infection16-20. However, other studies have shown contradicting results8. Such
discrepancy can be explained by the heterogeneity of immune histories and preexisting conditions in humans, which can influence COVID-19 susceptibility, and
the fact that those human studies were retrospective. Our study brings more
clarity to this issue of heterologous protection mediated by prior coronavirus
infections, as we utilize well-controlled mouse models with known immune
histories. A limitation of our study is that we only evaluated heterologous immune
protection at an early time post-vaccination or post-infection, and it is possible
that cross-protective immunity declines over time. Future studies will determine
whether cross-reactive antibodies are produced by plasma cells, or short-lived
plasmablasts, which tend to be highly mutated and cross-reactive21,22. In
summary, we show that coronavirus vaccines and coronavirus infections can
confer protection against other coronaviruses. These findings provide a
framework for the rational design of universal coronavirus vaccines, and present

Materials and Methods

Human Subjects
All protocols used for subject recruitment, enrollment, blood collection, sample
processing and immunological assays with human samples were approved by
the Northwestern University Institutional review board (STU00212583). All
participants voluntarily enrolled in the study by signing an informed consent form
after receiving detailed information of the clinical study.

Inclusion criteria

consisted of being 18 years of age or greater, a SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or a
scheduled vaccination for COVID-19, and ability and willingness to provide
informed consent. Exclusion criteria consisted of less than 18 years of age or
unwillingness or inability to provide informed consent. Enrollment started on
August 2020 and is expected to be completed by August 2022. Subject
population consisted of patients admitted to Northwestern Memorial Hospital and
of residents across the Chicago area. Adults of different ages, races and
ethnicities were included in the study. Subjects were de-identified by assigning a
4-letter study code, which will be used for the duration of the study. Hospital
admitted patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection by polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) assay. Participants considered as exposed before vaccination
had a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 any time prior to vaccination. Blood was
collected by phlebotomy using BD Vacutainer 10mL tubes containing sodium
heparin. Anticoagulated blood was added to LeucoSep tubes (Greiner Bio) and

Mice, vaccinations, infections and challenges
6-8-week-old C57BL/6, BALB/c, A/J, Ifnar1-/- mice (on a C57BL/6 background)
were used. For VSV-SARS-2 spike vaccinations, k18-hACE2 mice were used.
Mice were purchased from Jackson laboratories (approximately half males and
half females) and housed at the Northwestern University Center for Comparative
Medicine (CCM) or the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Mice were
immunized intramuscularly (50 µl per quadriceps) with: adenovirus serotype 5
expressing SARS-CoV-2-spike protein (Ad5-SARS-2 spike; 109 PFU), vesicular
stomatitis virus expressing SARS-CoV-2-spike protein (VSV-SARS-2-spike; 107
PFU), mRNA-based vaccine encoding SARS-CoV-2-spike protein (mRNASARS-2 spike; 5 µg), SARS-CoV-2 “whole spike” protein (SARS-2 spike; 100
µg), SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein (SARS-2 RBD protein; 100 µg), gamma-irradiated
SARS-CoV-2 (inactivated SARS-2; 2.5x105 PFU), and modified vaccinia Ankara
expressing SARS-CoV-1 spike protein (MVA-SARS-1 spike; 107 PFU).

We obtained Ad5-SARS-2 spike from the University of Iowa viral vector core
(VVC-U-7643); VSV-SARS-2 spike from Dr. Sean Whelan (Washington
University in St. Louis); and MVA-SARS-1 spike from the NIH Biodefense and
Emerging Infections Research Resources Repository, NIAID, NIH (NR-623,
originally developed by Dr. Bernard Moss3).

We synthesized mRNA vaccines encoding for the codon-optimized SARS-CoV-2
Spike protein from strain USA-WA1/2020. Constructs were purchased from
Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) and contained a T7 promoter site for in vitro
transcription of mRNA, 5’ UTR and 3’ UTRs. The sequence of the 5’ and 3’ UTRs
were identical to previous publications with a Dengue virus mRNA vaccine23.
mRNA was synthesized from linearized DNA with T7 in vitro transcription kits
from CellScript and following manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was generated with
pseudouridine in place of uridine with the Incognito mRNA synthesis kit (Cat# CICTY110510). 5’ cap-1 structure and 3’ poly-A tail were enzymatically added.
mRNA was encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles using the PNI Nanosystems
NanoAssemblr Benchtop system. mRNA was dissolved in PNI Formulation
Buffer (Cat# NWW0043) and was run through a laminar flow cartridge with
GenVoy ILM (Cat# NWW0041) encapsulation lipids at a flow ratio of 3:1 (RNA in
PNI Buffer : Genvoy ILM) at total flow rate of 12 mL/min to produce mRNA-LNPs.
These mRNA-LNPs were characterized for encapsulation efficiency and mRNA
concentration via RiboGreen Assay using Invitrogen's Quant-iT Ribogreen RNA
Assay Kit (Cat# R11490).

SARS-CoV-2 spike and RBD proteins used for vaccinations were produced at
the Northwestern Recombinant Protein Production Core by Dr. Sergii

vaccines were administered with 1:10 AdjuPhos (Invivogen).

Inactivated SARS-CoV-2 was obtained from BEI resources, NIAID (SARS-related
Coronavirus 2, isolate USA-WA1/2020, gamma-irradiated, NR-52287). MHV-1
was purchased from ATCC (VR-261) and OC43 was received from BEI (NR52725). MHV-A59 was a kind gift from Dr. Susan Weiss (University of
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA).

OC43 and MHV challenges: Mice were infected intranasally (25 µl per nostril)
with OC43 (2x106 PFU) or mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-1/MHV-A59; 106 PFU). All
mouse experiments with BL2 agents were performed with approval from the
Northwestern University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

SARS-CoV-2 challenges: Mouse adapted SARS-CoV-2 (MA10) was kindly
provided by Dr. Ralph Baric24. SARS-CoV-2 (MA10) was propagated and tittered
on Vero-E6 cells. BALB/c mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and challenged
via intranasal inoculation with 8x103 FFU of SARS-CoV-2 (MA10). Lungs were
isolated from mice at 5 days post infection and homogenized in PBS. RNA was
extracted from lung homogenate using a Zymo Research Quick-RNA 96 Kit
(R1052). Viral genomes were quantified via qPCR with N1 primer/probe kit from
IDT (Cat. # 10006713). SARS-CoV-2 infections were performed at the University

Protein-specific ELISA (SARS-CoV-2 spike, RBD, nucleocapsid; SARS-CoV1 spike; OC43 spike)
Antigen-specific total antibody titers were measured by ELISA as described
previously (Dangi et al., 2020; Palacio et al., 2020). Briefly, 96-well flat-bottom
MaxiSorp plates (Thermo Scientific) were coated with 1 µg/ml of respective
protein, for 48 hr at 4°C. Plates were washed three times with wash buffer (PBS
+ 0.05% Tween 20). Blocking was performed with blocking solution (200 µl of
PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 + 2% bovine serum albumin), for 4 hr at room
temperature. 6 µl of sera were added to 144 µl of blocking solution in the first
column of the plate, 1:3 serial dilutions were performed until row 12 for each
sample, and plates were incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Plates were
washed three times with wash buffer followed by addition of secondary antibody
conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, goat anti-mouse IgG (Southern Biotech)
diluted in blocking solution (1:1000) at 100 µl/well were added and incubated for
60 min at room temperature. For the ELISAs with human sera samples, goat
anti-human IgG (H + L) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson
ImmunoResearch) was used. After washing plates three times with wash buffer,
100 µl/well of Sure Blue substrate (SeraCare) was added for 1 min. Reaction was
stopped using 100 µl/well of KPL TMB Stop Solution (SeraCare). Absorbance
was measured at 450 nm using a Spectramax Plus 384 (Molecular Devices).

Virus propagation
OC43 was propagated in an 80-90% confluent monolayer of HCT-8 cells
(ATCC® CCL-244™) in T175 flasks at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01
diluted in 5 mL of RPMI supplemented with 2% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin,
and 1% L-glutamine. Infected cells were incubated at 33°C for 2 hr in a
humidified 5% CO2 incubator. After incubation, flasks were supplemented with
20 ml of 2% RPMI and incubated for 5 days at 33°C in a CO2 incubator. MHVA59 and MHV-1 were expanded in 17CL-1 cells following a prior protocol27.

OC43 and MHV quantification by plaque assay
For MHV quantification, L2 cells (106 cells per well) were seeded into 6-well
plates in 10% DMEM (10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and L-glutamine).
After 2 days, when cells reached ~100% confluency, media were removed. 10fold serial dilutions of viral stock or homogenized lung were prepared in 1%

DMEM (1% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and L-glutamine), added to wells,
and incubated at 37°C for 1 hr, gently rocking plates every 10 minutes. After
incubation, 3.5 mL of 1% agarose diluted 1:1 with 20% 2X-199 media (2X-199
media supplemented with 20% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and L-glutamine)
was overlaid onto the monolayer and the plates were incubated at 37°C 5% CO2
for 2 days. On day 2, the agar overlay was removed gently and the monolayer
was stained with 1% crystal violet for 15 minutes. After staining, the crystal violet
was aspirated, plates were washed once with 2 ml water per well, and then dried
to visualize plaques. Quantification of OC43 stocks for challenge studies was
similar to the quantification of MHV-A5927 except that 5 ml of agar overlay was
added on an infected monolayer of L2 cells and incubated at 33°C in CO2
incubator for 5-6 days. Monolayer was stained with 1% crystal violet and plaques
quantified by manual counting. For viral load quantification in lung, tissue was
collected in round-bottom 14-ml tubes (Falcon) containing 2 ml of 1% FBS
DMEM. Tissues were ruptured using a Tissue Ruptor homogenizer (Qiagen).
Homogenized tissues were clarified using a 100-µm strainer (Scientific Inc.) to
remove debris, and clarified tissue lysates were used for plaque assay.

using OC43-nucleocapsid specific TaqMan primers and a probe 18 fluorescentlabelled with a 5’-FAM reporter dye and 3’-BHQ quencher (IDT) and AgPath-ID™
One-Step RT-PCR kit (AgPath AM1005, Applied Biosystems) on an ABI
QuantStudio 3 platform (Thermo Fisher). Each sample was tested in duplicates
in 25 µl reactions containing 12.5 µl of a 2X RT-PCR buffer, 1 µl of 25X RT-PCR
enzyme mix provided with the AgPath kit, 0.5 µl (450 nM) forward primer, 0.5 µl
(450 nM) reverse primer, 0.5 µl (100 nM) of probe, and 10 µl RNA. In parallel,
each sample was also tested for beta-actin gene as an internal control to verify
RNA extraction quality using mouse beta-actin-specific Taqman primers/probe
labelled with 5’-FAM and 3’-BHQ (IDT). Thermal cycling involved reverse
transcription at 45°C for 10 min, denaturation at 95°C for 15 min, followed by 45
cycles of amplification (15 sec at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C.) To avoid crosscontamination, single use aliquots were prepared for all reagents including

from lung homogenate using a Zymo Research Quick-RNA 96 Kit (R1052). Viral
genomes were quantified via RT-qPCR with the TaqMan RNA-to-Ct 1-step kit
(ThermoFisher, Cat # 4392653) and primer/probe sets with the following
sequences: Forward 5’ GAC CCC AAA ATC AGC GAA AT 3’, Reverse 5’ TCT

TGG ACC 3’ (Integrated DNA Technologies, Cat # 10006713). A SARS CoV-2
copy number control was obtained from BEI (NR-52358) and used to quantify
SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

Dendritic cell (DC) vaccination
We followed a protocol similar to that from a prior publication28, but using DC2.4
cells instead of BMDCs. In brief, after thawing DC2.4 cells were passaged 3
times in 10% RPMI (10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, and L-glutamine). When
the monolayer reached ~70% confluency, the DCs were stimulated with LPS
(100 ng/ml; Sigma Aldrich) and incubated for 1 day in a 5% CO2 incubator at
37°C. The next day, a cocktail of overlapping peptide pools (SARS-CoV-2 spike,
envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid: SARS-2-SEMN) was added to the DCs
for 2 hr (1 µM/peptide). DCs were washed 5x with PBS, and 106 DCs were
injected into C57BL/6 mice intravenously via the lateral vein. At day 7 post-prime,
splenocytes from a naïve mouse were coated with the same peptide pools and
incubated for 2 hr, followed by washing 5x with PBS. Mice were then boosted
with 20x106 peptide-coated splenocytes intraperitoneally. DMSO (vehicle) coated
DCs and spleen cells were used as controls.

The SARS-CoV-2 spike overlapping peptide pools were obtained from BEI
resources, NIH (NR-52402). The SARS-CoV-2 envelope overlapping peptide
pools were obtained from BEI resources, NIH (NR-52405). The SARS-CoV-2
membrane overlapping peptide pools were obtained from BEI resources, NIH

(NR-52403). The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid overlapping peptide pools were
obtained from BEI resources, NIH (NR-52404).

Reagents, flow cytometry, and equipment
Dead cells were gated out using Live/Dead fixable dead cell stain (Invitrogen).
The SARS-CoV-2 spike overlapping peptide pools obtained from BEI resources,
NIH (NR-52402) were used for intracellular cytokine staining. Biotinylated MHC
class I monomers (Kb VNFNFNGL, abbreviated as Kb VL8) were obtained from
the NIH tetramer facility at Emory University. Cells were stained with
fluorescently-labelled antibodies against CD44 (IM7 on Pacific Blue), CD8α (536.7 on PerCP-Cy5.5), IFNγ (XMG1.2 on APC). Fluorescently-labelled antibodies
were purchased from BD Pharmingen, except for anti-CD44 (which was from
Biolegend). Flow cytometry samples were acquired with a Becton Dickinson
Canto II or an LSRII and analyzed using FlowJo (Treestar).

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assays
A SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was generated by transfection of HEK-293T cells
with a pCAGGS vector expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (BEI
resources, NIAID, NIH: NR-52310). 24 hr later, transfected cells were infected
with VSV∆G*G-GFP at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. After 24 hr, GFP
foci were visualized, and the supernatant was harvested and passed through a
0.45 µM filter. This SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was concentrated using an Amicon
Ultra-15 filter (UFC910024, Sigma-Aldrich), and then stored at −80°C. Titers

were measured by infecting HEK-293T-hACE2 cells and counting GFP foci under
a fluorescence microscope after 24 hr.

The SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay was performed by mixing
serial dilutions of MVA-SARS-CoV-1 immune mice sera (or naïve sera) with 200
FFU of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in a 96-well plate and incubating for 2 hr. After
incubation, 100 µl of the sera-virus mixture was transferred to a half area 96-well
plate containing HEK-293T-hACE2 cells. The next day, GFP foci were counted in
each well under a fluorescent microscope.

MHC-I binding predictions
The MHC-I binding predictions were made on 5/17/2021 using the IEDB analysis
resource NetMHCpan (ver. 4.1) tool29, at http://tools.iedb.org/mhci/.

Single cell TCR-Seq Data Acquisition and Analysis
C57BL/6 mice were immunized intramuscularly with 109 PFU of Ad5-SARS-2
spike, and at day 28, splenic CD8 T cells were MACS-sorted using negative
selection (STEMCELL). Purified CD8 T cells were stained with Kb VL8, Live/Dead
stain, and flow cytometry antibodies for CD8 and CD44. Live, CD8+, CD44+, Kb
VL8+ cells were FACS-sorted to ~99% purity on a FACS Aria cytometer (BD
Biosciences) and delivered to the Northwestern University NU-Seq core for
scTCR-seq using Chromium NextGem 5’ v2 kit (10X Genomics). Once the library
was sequenced, the output file in BCL format was converted to fastq files and

aligned to mouse genome in order to generate a matrix file using the Cell Ranger
pipeline. These upstream QC steps were performed by Drs. Ching Man Wai and
Matthew Schipma at the Northwestern University NUSeq core. TCR analyses
were performed using the scRepertoire package30. Only cells expressing both
TCRα and TCRβ chains were selected. For cells with more than 2 TCR chains,
only the top 2 expressed chains were used.

Statistical analyses
Most statistical analyses used the Mann-Whitney test, unless specified otherwise
in the figure legend. Dashed lines in ELISA/plaque assay figures represent the
limit of detection. Data were analyzed using Prism (Graphpad).
