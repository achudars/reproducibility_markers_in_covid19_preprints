ABSTRACT
COVID-19 has caused over 900,000 deaths worldwide as of September 2020, and effective
medicines are urgently needed. Lopinavir was identified as an inhibitor of the HIV protease,
and a lopinavir-ritonavir combination therapy was reported to be beneficial for the treatment
of SARS and MERS. However, recent clinical tests could not prove that lopinavir-ritonavir
therapy was an effective treatment for COVID-19. In this report, we examined the effect of
lopinavir and ritonavir to the activity of the purified main protease (Mpro) protein of SARSCoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19. Unexpectedly, lopinavir and ritonavir did not inhibit
Mpro activity. These results will aid the drug candidate selection for ongoing and future
COVID-19 clinical trials.

1. Introduction
Lopinavir is an approved drug for treatment against human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)
and works by inhibiting the HIV-1 protease [1]. The approved drug ritonavir increases the
plasma level of lopinavir dramatically by inhibiting cytochrome p450 [1]. When severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in the 2000s, lopinavir was identified as a candidate
drug to treat SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2]. Lopinavir showed an inhibitory effect
against SARS-CoV in in vitro studies, and clinical tests with the lopinavir-ritonavir
combination showed a reduced risk of SARS-CoV infection [3, 4]. Lopinavir-ritonavir
treatment was also beneficial to treat Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV) [5, 6]. SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the current COVID-19 outbreak, is closely
related to and shows high sequence homology with SARS-CoV and, to a slightly lesser extent,
MERS-CoV coronaviruses [7]. For this reason, several clinical tests for COVID-19 were
performed with lopinavir-ritonavir, however the clinical results have not proved that lopinavirritonavir treatment was beneficial to treat COVID-19 [8, 9].
Lopinavir is known to be an inhibitor of the SARS-CoV main protease (Mpro, also known as
3CL protease), and recent bioinformatics studies showed that lopinavir may interact with Mpro
of SARS-CoV-2 [10, 11]. For this reason, lopinavir was assumed to inhibit Mpro of SARSCoV-2, however no evidence of this has been presented. In light of the recent COVID-19
clinical tests with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment, we attempted to evaluate the inhibitory activity
of lopinavir for Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. Using an in vitro protease assay with the purified Mpro
protein demonstrated that lopinavir as well as ritonavir, we found that two drugs did not have
any inhibitory activity against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. This study highlights differences
between the highly related SARS, MERS and COVID-19-causing coronaviruses, and will be
helpful in the selection of drug candidates for current and future COVID-19 clinical tests.

2. Material and methods
2. 1. Reagents. Lopinavir (SML1222, purity ≥ 98 %), ritonavir (SML0491, purity ≥ 98 %), and
(−)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (E4134, purity ≥ 95 %) were purchased from SigmaAldrich (Saint Louis, MO).
2.2. Protease assay for SARS-COV-2 Mpro. Preparation of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was described
previously [12]. Briefly, the nucleotide sequence of SARS-CoV-Mpro was chemically
synthesized and His-tagged Mpro was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells, and soluble Mpro
proteins were purified with an Ni-NTA resin (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. A FRET-based protease assay was used to measure
Mpro activity [12, 13]. Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans was chemically synthesized
(Anygen, Gwangju, South Korea) and used for SARS-COV-2 Mpro substrate. The protease
activity was performed using Mpro and FRET peptide in the reaction buffer (20 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 1 % DMSO) for 5 h. For the inhibition
assay, the purified Mpro protein was incubated with the chemicals for 1 h before the addition
of substrate. Relative protease activity was calculated as the difference between the protease
activity with Mpro and the activity without Mpro at the indicated time.

3. Results
Lopinavir/ritonavir treatment is currently being studied in several clinical trials for COVID-19,
and, in light of these studies, we attempted to measure the effect of lopinavir/ritonavir on
SARS-CoV-2. First, we set up the Mpro protease assay system with purified Mpro protein from
bacteria (Figure 1B and 1C). Next, Mpro protein was mixed with various concentration of
lopinavir, and the protease activity of Mpro was measured. Although high concentrations of
lopinavir up to 100 μg/ml were used, we did not observe any significant decrease of Mpro
activity (Figure 1D). Because lopinavir and ritonavir combination therapy is commonly used
for the clinical trials, we also examined the inhibitory activity of lopinavir and ritonavir
combinations. However, the lopinavir-ritonavir combination treatment also did not show any
significant decrease of Mpro activity (Figure 1E). As a positive control for MPro activity, we
used the compound EGCG [12] which showed significant inhibition of Mpro activity (Figure
1F). These results indicate that lopinavir and ritonavir did not have an inhibitory effect on Mpro
activity of SARS-CoV-2.

4. Discussion
Lopinavir-ritonavir is a candidate medicine for COVID-19, however clinical trials with
lopinavir-ritonavir did not prove that these medicines are beneficial for COVID-19 patients [8].
Here, we examined the inhibitory effect of lopinavir-ritonavir on SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease
activity and found that lopinavir-ritonavir is not effective to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro activity.
Lopinavir was reported to inhibit SARS-CoV Mpro with an IC50 of 25~50 μM [2]. However,
lopinavir nor combinations of lopinavir and ritonavir were not effective to inhibit SARS-CoV2 Mpro at any of the concentrations we tested. These results may explain the difference in drug
response on SARS and COVID-19 patients in the clinical trials.
Since lopinavir responds differently to SARS-CoV Mpro and SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, we
wondered if structural differences between the two Mpro proteins could account for the
disparity. Previous computational analysis studies listed the potential amino acid residues
responsible for the interaction between Mpro and lopinavir [10, 14-16]. Because SARS-CoV2 Mpro shares 96.08% identity with SARS-CoV Mpro, most of the listed amino acids are
identical [12]. Among the potential amino acids responsible for the interaction with lopinavir,
we found just one amino acid difference. Serine residue 46 of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is one of the
candidate amino acids for the interaction with lopinavir [10], however both SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV bear an alanine residue at that site in their Mpro protein sequences. Although the
sequence differences are not substantial, these trivial sequence differences may contribute to
the disparity in Mpro response to lopinavir. Further structural study will be required to reveal
the significance of these amino acid changes.
Because a remedy for COVID-19 is very urgent, many clinical trials for COVID-19 are under
way. Conducting clinical trials consumes tremendous time, effort and resource, target drug
information including in vitro data such as those presented here will be very important for the

success of the clinical trials. In this report, we demonstrated that lopinavir-ritonavir is not
effective to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and this information will be useful to choose the right
drug for SARS-CoV-2 clinical trials.
