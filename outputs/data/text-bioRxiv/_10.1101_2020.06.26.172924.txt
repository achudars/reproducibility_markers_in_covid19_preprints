Abstract
Effective systems for the analysis of molecular data are of fundamental importance for
real-time monitoring of the spread of infectious diseases and the study of pathogen
evolution. While the Nextstrain and GISAID portals offer widely used systems for the
classification of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, both present relevant limitations. Here we propose
a highly reproducible method for the systematic classification of SARS-CoV-2 viral types. To
demonstrate the validity of our approach, we conduct an extensive comparative genomic
analysis of more than 20,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Our classification system delineates
12 clusters and 4 super-clusters in SARS-CoV-2, with a highly biased spatio-temporal
distribution worldwide, and provides important observations concerning the evolutionary
processes associated with the emergence of novel viral types. Based on the estimates of
SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate and genetic distances of genomes of the early pandemic
phase, we infer that SARS-CoV-2 could have been circulating in humans since
August-November 2019. The observed pattern of genomic variability is remarkably similar
between all clusters and super-clusters, being UTRs and the s2m element, a highly
conserved secondary structure element, the most variable genomic regions. While several
polymorphic sites that are specific to one or more clusters were predicted to be under
positive or negative selection, overall, our analyses also suggest that the emergence of
novel genome types is unlikely to be driven by widespread convergent evolution and
independent fixation of advantageous substitutions. While, in the absence of rigorous
experimental validation, several questions concerning the evolutionary processes and the
phenotypic characteristics (increased/decreased virulence) remain open, we believe that the
approach outlined in this study can be of relevance for the tracking and functional
characterization of different types of SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

Introduction
The ongoing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic [1] poses the greatest global
health and socioeconomic threat

since

world war II. The first case of COVID-19 was

reported in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, in late December 2019 [2], although
retrospective analyses have placed the onset as early as December 1st.
The most common symptoms include fever, dry-cough and a general sense of fatigue, while
some patients also experience muscle pain, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, or
diarrhoea [3-4]. In a minority of the patients the infection may cause pneumonia, severe
acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death [5-6]. Symptoms are usually mild
in children and young adults , while elderly, immunosuppressed, and individuals affected by
a cardiac disease or diabetes are at higher risk of developing severe symptoms [7].
COVID-19 is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact
routes [8], although some recent studies suggest that airborne transmission might also be
possible [9-10]. The incubation period typically ranges between 2 and 14 days, although
longer incubation times have been also reported [11]. Notwithstanding the development of
several promising therapeutic approaches [12], at present no universally approved
therapeutic strategy is available for the treatment of COVID-19.
At the time of writing, COVID-19 has affected more than 200 countries worldwide, with more
than 9 Million confirmed individual infections and a death toll in excess of 480 thousand. The
limited availability of diagnostic kits in several countries, varying criteria for reporting
COVID-19-related deaths, and the fact that very mild or asymptomatic infections can often
go undetected [13], suggest that both these figures are likely to represent substantial
underestimates of the worldwide impact of SARS-CoV-2. The first complete genomic
sequences of the viral pathogen were determined in early January 2020 by Next Generation
Sequencing metatranscriptomics [14], allowing the rapid development of diagnostic tests
(Corman et al., 2020) and the development of molecular monitoring strategies [15-16].
The genome is approximately 30.000 nt in size and shows high similarity (~79%) with
SARS-CoV [17], a beta-coronavirus of the subgenus Sarbecovirus, and the causal agent of
a large scale epidemic of viral pneumonia (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, SARS)
that hit China and other 25 countries in 2003 and 2004 [18]. The International Committee
on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has designated the novel pathogen as SARS-CoV-2.
Phylogenetic analyses of conserved protein domains of more than 2500 coronaviruses have
been used to assign SARS-CoV-2 to the group of the Severe acute respiratory

syndrome-related coronavirus species (SARSr-CoV), where it forms a relatively distant sister
group to SARS-CoV, interleaved with various SARSr-CoV isolated from non-human
mammalian species [19].
SARS-CoV-2 shows the highest levels of genome identity (96%) with a bat SARS-related
(SARS-r) CoV denoted RaTG13, isolated in the Yunnan province [20]. Despite this
sequence similarity, SARS-CoV-2 differs from RaTG13 in several key features. Arguably, the
most important is the presence of a polybasic furin cleavage site insertion (residues PRRA)
at the junction of the S1 and S2 subunits of the Spike protein [21]. This insertion, which may
increase the infectivity of the virus, is not present in related beta-coronaviruses, although
similar polybasic insertions are observed in other human coronaviruses, including
HCoV-HKU1, as well as in highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza virus [22].
Additionally, the RBD (Recognition Binding Domain) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is
significantly more similar (97% identity) to that of SARSr-CoVs isolated from specimens of
Malayan pangolins (​Manis javanica​) illegally imported into southern China (Guangdong and
Guangxi provinces) than to the RDB of RaTG13 (​89% identity​). This data suggest the
possibility that pangolins or other mammalian species could have acted as “intermediate” or
“amplifying” hosts for human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [23-24].
As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, the number of viral isolates for which a
genomic sequence is available has increased substantially. Currently, in the excess of
50.000 viral genomes are publicly available in dedicated repositories [25]. As expected,
considering the recent ancestry, and reportedly low mutation rates of coronaviruses [26],
SARS-CoV-2 genomes are highly similar (average identity 99.99% ) and show reduced
genetic diversity. This low diversity notwithstanding, the availability of a considerable number
of genomic sequences, with worldwide sampling, allows the identification of phylogenetically
distinct clusters of SARS-CoV-2 sequences [27-32]. Interestingly, several of these clusters
show highly biased geographic distributions, and in many independent studies, the genomic
signatures of different clusters have been tentatively linked to increased/decreased virulence
or possible adaptation to human hosts [33-35].
While it should be stressed that, in the absence of careful experimental validation, it is
extremely difficult to determine if the identified SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants have
increased/decreased virulence and reflect adaptive evolution or genetic drift and founder
effects, the importance of establishing a simple and reproducible system for the delineation
of genomic diversity of human pathogens is universally acknowledged [36-37]. Indeed such
a classification system could be extremely useful for the rapid identification of new emerging
types and, more importantly, for a fine grained monitoring of the diffusion of pathogens in

different geographic contexts over time.
Currently, the most widely used models for the classification of SARS-CoV-2 viral types are
those provided by the curators of

the GISAID [38] and Netxstrain portals [39], which

incorporate the most complete and accurate resources for comparative genomics of
SARS-CoV-2, Providing extensive databases of more than 40000 viral sequences with
associated metadata, including date and place of isolation, as well as information concerning
health and background data of the patients. GISAID also provides tools for comparative
genomic and phylogenetic analyses to facilitate the annotation of the genomes, their
classification in types/groups and the functional interpretation of the data. Similarly,
Nexstrain collects a selection of publicly available genomes and associated metadata, to
provide informative analyses and graphical representation of the spread of SARS-CoV-2
over time as well as detailed and curated phylogenetic analyses for the classification of
genome types. Although both platforms constitute invaluable resources for the SARS-CoV-2
research community, the associated

classification systems suffer from some inherent

limitations. The most important is that the criteria used to establish the clusters/types of
SARS-CoV-2 are not set out clearly, and

that the delineation of clusters is based on

arbitrary manual annotation of phylogenetic trees, rather than on inherent genomic features
of SARS-CoV-2, limiting the reproducibility of results. Furthermore, Nextstrain provides
classification only for a restricted selection of the available viral genomes (currently less than
4000).

Finally, limited variability and the recurrent events of recombination observed in

Sarbecovirus [40-41] may hinder the validity of classification systems based purely on
phylogenetic analyses and manual annotation.
In the light of these considerations, in the present work we propose a simple set of rules,
which could serve as an operational classification system of SARS-CoV-2 genomic
sequences.

The proposed classification system is inspired by MultiLocus Strain Typing

(MLST), a classification approach normally used for microbes [​42]​. Thus, for a given dataset
of available SARS-CoV-2 genomes, it combines the empirical study of genomic variability
with the analyses of the high frequency variant sites that are fixed in the extant viral
population. In this way our approach derives a simple but effective set of rules for a
systematic and highly reproducible delineation of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, that are therefore
grouped in clusters and superclusters.
To demonstrate the validity of our approach, we conducted an extensive comparative
genomic analysis of more than 20,000 SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes. By applying the
proposed classification system we derived important observations concerning different types

of SARS-CoV-2, their evolutionary pattern and geographic distribution, and the mechanisms
associated with the emergence of possible novel types.

Materials and methods
A collection of 20,521 putatively complete high coverage SARS-CoV-2 genomes and
associated metadata was retrieved from the GISAID EpicoV [38] platform on 28th May
2020. A total of 13 SARSr-CoV genomic sequences isolated from non-human hosts,
including bats and pangolins [23-24], were also retrieved from the GISAID EpiCoV portal at
the same date. SARS-CoV-2 sequence comparisons were performed using the reference
Refseq [43] assembly NC_045512.2, collected on 26th December 2019 and identical to the
sequence of the oldest SARS-CoV-2 isolates, dating back to 24th December 2019
(EPI_ISL_402123).
SARS-CoV-2 genomes were aligned to the 29,903 nt-long reference assembly of
SARS-CoV-2 by means of the ​nucmer program [44]. Custom Perl scripts were used to infer
the size of each genomic assembly and the number of uncalled bases/gaps (denoted by N in
the genomic sequence). Then, we analysed only the 11,633 high quality complete genomes,
defined as those longer than 29,850 nt and including less than 150 ambiguous sites.
Variant sites, including substitutions and small insertion and deletions, were identified by
using the ​show-snps utility of the ​nucmer package. Output files were processed by the
means of a custom Perl script, and converted into a phenetic matrix, with variable positions
on the rows and viral isolates in the columns. Values of 1 and 0 were respectively used to
indicate presence or absence of a variant.
Genetic distances between genomic sequences were established from this phenetic matrix
using the ​dist function of the R ​stat package with default parameters (Euclidean distances)
[45-46]. Clusters were established by means of hierarchical clustering algorithms, with
complete linkage as implemented in the ​hclust R standard libraries function. The ​cutree
function was used to separate distinct clusters at the desired level of divergence (2 distinct
variant sites).
Functional effects of genetic variants, as identified from genome alignments, were predicted
by means of a custom Perl script, based on the annotation of the NC_045512.2
SARS-CoV-2 reference assembly.

Identification of sites possibly under selection was performed by applying the MEME and
FEL methods, as implemented in the ​Hyphy package[47], on the concatenated alignment of
protein coding sequences of all the 11,633 previously identified high quality complete
SARS-CoV-2 genomes. A p-value of 0.05 was considered for the significance threshold.
A total of 68 viral genomes of the SARS 2003 outbreak were retrieved from the NCBI virus
database [48]. Classification/association of strains to the 3 (early/middle/late) phases of the
SARS 2003 epidemic are according to Song et al 2005 [49].
Calculation of evolutionary rates of SARS-CoV-2 and estimation of times of divergence were
performed according to the formula described in Zhao et al ​[50]​, based on genetic distances
as determined in this study.
Analyses of prevalence of allele frequency over time were executed based on the collection
dates of individual genomes as reported in the GISAID metadata table. The collection date
of the reference genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 in GISAID (26th December 2020), was
set as time 0. Consecutive, non-overlapped intervals of 10 by 10 days were considered. A
total of 1381 genomic sequences, for which collection dates were not reported in GISAID,
were excluded from these analyses.
Comparison of levels of variability of “early” and “late” clusters of SARS-CoV-2 genomes
were established by 100 random resampling of 150 genomes (batch), matched by date of
collection, from each defined cluster (see below). The total number of distinct variant sites
was calculated for each random batch of genomes, in order to derive a distribution of
genomic variability. Significance between distributions of genomic diversity were established
by means of the Wilcoxon, Sum and Rank test as implemented in the standard R libraries
[45].
Variability with respect to the reference NC_045512.2 SARS-CoV-2 genome was computed
on sliding windows of 100 bp, overlapped by 50 bp, by counting the proportion of variable
sites contained in each window (number of variable sites in the window, divided by the total
number of variable sites in the entire genome) with a custom Perl script. A Fisher-exact test,
contrasting the local variability in a window with the average variability in the genome, was

its Minimum Folding Energy (MFE) calculation were estimated with the RNAfold program
[51] of the Vienna package [52], by artificially implanting each of the possible 129
substitutions in the 43 nt-long s2m sequence identified in the reference SARS-CoV-2
genome and in the presumably ancestral sequence of s2m, as observed in the genome of
the RatG13 SARSr-CoV-2.
Prediction of the consensus co-folding structure of s2m in SARS-CoV-2 was obtained by
applying the R-scape[53] program to the alignment of all s2m sequences found in the
collection of the 11,633 high quality complete genome analysed in this study.
Consensus secondary structure of the s2m element of Coronaviruses was as in the model

Results
Genomic features and evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2
We retrieved 20,521 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences labeled as

high coverage and

putatively complete, covering 86 countries in 5 continents from the GISAID EpiCoV portal.
Surprisingly, we observed that a considerable number (6462) of the reportedly complete
genomic assemblies of SARS-CoV-2 presented incomplete 3’ or 5’ UTRs (median size
29782 nts; reference genome size of 29,903 nts, including a polyA tail of 33 nts).
Additionally, 4310 genomes contained a large number of gaps and/or uncalled bases ranging from 151 to 3500. Stringent criteria were used to retain only sequences which were
more likely to represent a nearly complete assembly of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (more than
29,850 nts in size) and contained only a limited number of missing positions (less than 150
Ns). A total of 11,633 genomes were therefore selected and analysed (Supplementary Table
S1).
Comparative analysis of genetic distances between these SARS-CoV-2 genomes (see

Materials and methods) showed an average number of 0.64 variant sites per nearest
neighbor pair. The equivalent figure for late-phase isolates of SARS-CoV from the SARS
2003-2004 epidemics [49] was slightly higher (0.78 polymorphic sites per nearest neighbor
pair). Consistent with these observations, estimates of mutation rates, according to the
formula described in Zhao et al [50] are marginally lower for SARS-CoV-2 (1.84 x 10​-3
substitutions per site per year) compared to SARS-CoV (2.38 x 10​-3 substitutions per site per
year). Interestingly, we notice that 6384 (54.87%) of the high quality SARS-CoV-2 genomes
here analysed have a perfect sequence identity (0 polymorphic sites) with respect to their
closest neighbor. All in all these observations are consistent with the reportedly low mutation
rate of coronaviruses with respect to other single strand RNA viruses [26,50].
A total of 6319 distinct variant sites were observed between the 11,633 high quality
genomes included in these analyses (Supplementary Table S2). 99.22% of these sites have
an allele frequency below 1%, the threshold above which a variant is often considered fixed
in a natural population [54]. This value is not surprising, consideringly the relatively recent
ancestry and the low mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, only 50 variant positions (0.88%)
show an allele frequency of 1% or greater (Table 1).
Importantly, when the entire collection of 20,521 SARS-CoV-2 genomes considered in this
study is taken into account, the total number of variant sites is significantly increased (9398
sites,Supplementary Table S2), but the number and type of high (≥ 1%) frequency variant
sites remains relatively constant (46), suggesting a robust estimate of allele frequencies for
these sites. Of note, of the 4 sites that show an apparent reduction in prevalence, 3 are
located in the 200 nt of the 3’ terminal end of the genome, while one is positioned within the
first 36 nt of the 5’ end (Table 1). This suggests that the apparent reduction in allele
frequency at these 4 sites is most probably due to an incomplete representation of the
terminal ends of the genomes.
Functional annotation of the complete collection of variant sites identified in this study,
shows a similar proportion of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions among the
6319 low frequency (<1%) variants (50.73% and 49.27% respectively). Conversely, the
proportion of non synonymous substitutions is increased to 66.6% (OR=1.31, Fisher p-value
0.159) in the 42 high frequency (≥1%) polymorphic sites associated with protein coding
genes (Table 1).
The MEME and FEL methods [47] were applied to the concatenated alignments of protein
coding genes of the 11,633 high quality complete genomes to identify signals of adaptive

evolution. A total of 194 sites were associated (p-value ≤ 0.05) with signatures of selection
according to at least one method (Supplementary Table S3). Of these, 118 sites were
associated with positive selection, while 76 sites were deemed to be under negative
selection.
Strikingly, a highly significant over-representation of both sites under negative and positive
selection is observed among the 42 high frequency polymorphic sites of protein coding
genes (Table 1). In particular, 8 of these sites (OR=8.65, Fisher p-value 4.41e-07) are
highlighted as evolving under positive selection, while 11 sites (OR=17.82, Fisher p-value
1.95e-12) were predicted to be under negative selection.

An operational classification of SARS-CoV-2 genomes
An ideal classification system based on molecular data should consider evolutionary
features of the species under study to identify the minimum level of divergence required to
delineate different types of genomic sequences. Moreover, to avoid excessive-fragmentation
each cluster should incorporate a relevant proportion of population. Finally the system
should be easy to implement and allow the rapid classification of novel specimens as they
become available. Although the classification systems proposed by GISAID and Nextstrain
are widely used, we observe that both systems suffer from several limitations, including:
1. Low reproducibility​: the rules used to establish different clades of genomes are not
set out clearly and in a systematic manner. Hence neither existing classification
systems can be reproduced/re-applied in full and do not allow the automatic
classification of novel strains;
2. Presence of polyphyletic groups: although both systems are based on
phylogenetic approaches, both the Nextstrain and GISAID proposed classification of
SARS-CoV-2 incorporate polyphyletic groups/clusters of genomes (Supplementary
Figure S1: see Group G of GISAID; Groups 19A and 20A of Nextstrain);
3. Bias towards highly abundant genome types: both in GISAID and Nextstrain
groups of genome are established visually based on the relative abundance of
groups that populate the phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2. Since sampling of viral
genomes is not guaranteed to be uniform across countries, and is indeed biased
even between countries with reportedly similar numbers of affected individuals (i.e
see for example Italy and UK,Supplementary Table S1) this could result in a
over-fragmentation of genome types for which a large number of representative

sequences are available, but also - and more important - to mis-classification of the
types of genomes which, for the time being are less represented in the phylogenetic
tree. This is exemplified by the fact that at present, more than 1500 genomes are not
assigned to a type according to GISAID.
As outlined in the previous section currently available genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2
show a limited level of variability and a low number of high frequency polymorphic sites.
Moreover, a relatively high proportion of these sites may evolve under adaptive selection,
possibly consistent with functional consequences of variants. Based on these observations,
we propose a simple set of empirical rules for the operational classification of SARS-CoV-2
genomes:
1. Similar to approaches used for Multi Locus Strain typing [42], classification of
SARS-CoV-2 genomes should be based on variants that are shared by a relevant
proportion of viral population. Since a prevalence of 1% is normally considered to
identify genetic variants that have reached fixation in a population [54], we propose to
use this cut-off as the natural threshold for identifying high frequency variants .
2. In the light of the fact that closely related genomes show an average of 0.64
polymorphic sites, we suggest that distinct clusters/types should differ at least for 2
high frequency polymorphic sites
3. To avoid an excessive fragmentation, each cluster/type should incorporate at least
100 distinct genomes.
4. Since the variability of SARS-CoV-2 is limited, clusters/types that share one or more
high frequency polymorphic sites should form groups of higher order (super-cluster).
To evaluate the validity of the proposed clustering approach, we applied the criteria defined
above for clustering both the 11,633 high quality genomes (high quality set), as defined by
our stringent criteria, and the entire collection of 20,521 genomes (extended set).
Considerations regarding the apparent reduction in allele frequency of polymorphic sites at
the ends of the genome (see above), prompted us to exclude these sites from the analyses
of the extended set.
Irrespective of the dataset considered (Figure 1A, Supplementary Figure S2A), our criteria
consistently identified 12 clusters (C1-C12) and 4 super-clusters (SC1-SC4) (Table
2,Supplementary Table S1). As outlined in Figure 1B (and Supplementary Figure S2B), each
cluster and supercluster is defined by a characteristic molecular signature consisting of
states at 2 to 9 high frequency variable sites. Cluster 1 is the only exception in this respect,

since it is formed by genomes that are highly similar to the reference.
A comparison of our proposed clustering systems with the current classifications of
Nexstrain and GISAID (Table 2), shows that our method recapitulates all of the major groups
of genomes defined by GISAID and Nextstrain, as well as identifies additional clusters
undescribed by only one (clusters 9 and 10) or both (clusters 11 and 12) other classification
methods. Importantly, although the novel clusters defined in this study are formed by a
relatively limited number of genomes (243 and 315 respectively for cluster 11 and 12), they
show a similar genetic distance from the reference genome as all the other previously
defined larger clusters (Figure 1B). Notably, a heatmap of worldwide prevalence of
SARS-CoV-2 types (Figure 2) shows that cluster 12 represents more than 40% of the
genomes isolated in India, but shows only a very modest prevalence in all other countries
worldwide. To facilitate the classification of newly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes an
automated software package that implements the criteria devised in the present study has is
made publicly available at ​https://github.com/matteo14c/assign_CL_SARS-CoV-2​ .
Of the 50 high frequency polymorphic sites included in our analyses 35 reach complete, or
nearly complete fixation (relative AF ≥ 0.9) in at least one cluster (Table 1, Figure 1B). Of
these 35, only three variants (11083G->T; 14805C->T; 28311C->T) show an allele frequency
≥ 0.01 in more than one super-cluster, while the remaining 32 have an AF≥0.01 in only one
super-cluster, and can be therefore considered super-cluster “specific”. These observations
strongly support our hypothesis that high frequency variable sites, as defined here, are
highly effective for the discrimination/classification of distinct types of SARS-CoV-2.
Strikingly,

15 of the 35 sites that are fixed in and specific to at least one cluster are

predicted to be under positive (8) or negative (7) selection according to FEL or MEME (Table
1). Although this observation might be suggestive of distinct phenotypic features/properties
for the different SARS-CoV-2 types, as previously suggested by other authors [33-35], we
remark that in the absence of experimental validations, these data should be interpreted very
carefully.
As shown in Figure 3 and consistently with previous reports, we observe a highly biased
geographic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 genome types worldwide [27-32]. Indeed, while
relatively similar proportions of each cluster/supercluster are observed in Asia, the majority
of all viral genomes observed in other continents are assigned to super-cluster 3 (SC3,
consisting of C5 to C8). Importantly, from Figure 2 we notice that

there is a modest

prevalence of SC3 in China, the country that is currently considered the origin of the
outbreak, where it accounts for only 5.1 % of all the genome types therein observed.

Spatio-temporal distribution of SARS-CoV-2 genome types and emergence of
new types
Phylogeographic analyses show a highly biased distribution of SARS-CoV-2 genomes
worldwide (Figure 3). However, representatives of each super-cluster are already observed
in different geographic regions of China - the presumed country of origin of the outbreakwithin 25 days of the report of the first case of COVID19 in Wuhan (Supplementary Figure
S3A). During the same time period, 3 distinct clusters of genomes, each belonging to a
different super-cluster (SC1, SC2 and SC4), are already observed in Wuhan (Supplementary
Figure S3B). Assuming a constant evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2, and based on the
average genetic distances of 52 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated in China during the early
phases of the pandemic (prior to January 20th), we calculated that SARS-Cov-2 might have
been circulating undetected in humans at least since August-November 2019, that is 82.3 ​±
40.4 days before 26th December 2019, the collection date of the reference SARS-Cov-2

genome (​Supplementary Table S4​). Strikingly, we notice that, among the 50 high frequency
variants of SARS-CoV-2, 12 are also present in one or more genomes of SARSr-CoV-2
isolated from bat and/or pangolin specimens (Supplementary Figure S4). This last
observation suggests the presence of a much higher unexplored diversity shared by
SARS-CoV-2 and SARSr-CoV-2 viral genomes.
To investigate possible scenarios of emergence of novel genome types, the frequency
distribution of the 50 high prevalence alleles (AF ≥ 0.01) was calculated at intervals of 10
days since 26th Dec 2019 (the collection date of the reference genome) separately for each
of the 4 super-clusters and for the 12 clusters. Within clusters, distributions of allele
frequency are highly stable and do not change over time (Supplementary Figures S5, S6,
S7). On the contrary 27 alleles show a rapid emergence and an almost immediate fixation in
each viral super-cluster (Figure 4 Supplementary Table S5 Supplementary Table S6). The
most notable examples of this pattern are genomic positions 1059, 25563 and 14408 in SC3
and 17747, and 17858 in SC2. Strikingly, 23 out of the 27 alleles rapidly emerging/fixed in
super-clusters correspond with polymorphic sites specific to and completely fixed (AF >0.9)
within one or more clusters (Supplementary Table S6). This suggests that the early
emergence of novel clusters of virus could be used to detect changes of allele prevalence in
the whole viral population.
Strikingly, several clusters of SARS-CoV-2 genomes are not observed during the initial

phases of the pandemics and seem to emerge at a later time (Supplementary figures S5,
S6, S7). Using an arbitrary threshold of time ≥60 days after the collection of the reference
genome (26th Dec 2019), clusters have been divided in "late" (C3, C4, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10,
C12: appearing after 60 days) and "early" (C1, C2, C5, C11: appearing before 60 days)
(Table 3). We found that "early" clusters have a probable origin in China, as observed in the
comparison of the phenetic patterns and the localities of the first 50 isolates (in terms of
date) of each cluster (see Supplementary Figure S8). Interestingly, 6 of the 8 "late" clusters
are likely to have originally emerged outside China (C4, C6, C7, C8, C10, C12) (Figure 2,
Supplementary Figure S9). Overall, the low levels of variability of SARS-CoV-2, the
emergence of novel genome types at different times during the pandemic, and the highly
biased phylogeographic distribution (Figure 2), suggest that novel genome types of the “late”
pandemic phases likely derived from the fixation of novel alleles in “early” pre-existent types.
We speculate that

several possible alternative evolutionary processes can explain this

pattern of rapid allele fixation, including genetic drift and founder effects [55-56], convergent
evolution, and/or rapid selection of standing variation for the adaptation to a novel
environment [57]. To discriminate between these scenarios, we reasoned that while founder
effects and selection should be associated with an overall reduction in genomic diversity of
relevant viral sub-populations population, convergent evolution should not alter the
underlying allele frequency distribution of the population (except at the sites under selection).
We then compared the overall allele diversity between batches of genomes from all the
clusters forming the super-clusters SC2 and SC3, batches equivalent both in number and
timescale (see Materials and Methods) (Figure 5A). SC1 was not considered due to being
composed of a single cluster, while considerations regarding the limited availability of
genomes matched by collection date prompted us to exclude SC4 from these analyses. The
results show a statistically significant (p-value Wilcoxon 1.3e-07 for C3, 1.5e-07 for C4 and
9.21e-08, 1.21e-07 and 1.13e-07 for C6, C7 and C8 respectively) reduction of genetic
diversity for late clusters (i.e. clusters emerging after ≥60 days) compared to early clusters.
Importantly (Figure 5B, Table3), we observe that evolutionary rates are highly homogeneous
and do not show detectable changes between clusters, suggesting that reduced diversity of
late clusters is not associated

with a reduction of evolutionary rates. According to our

starting hypothesis, and in the light of the strong phylogeographic bias, these results suggest
that the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 genome types is unlikely to be driven by
widespread convergent evolution and independent fixation of advantageous substitutions.
Remarkably, our analyses do not support an increased genomic diversity for clusters

included in SC3 (Figure 5A), although their common molecular signature, i.e., the prevalent
polymorphic site at position 14408 in the nsp12 gene (RdRp), was previously described as
associated with an increased genomic variability (​Pachetti et al. [33]​). We speculate that
biased/incomplete sampling of SC3 during the early phase of the pandemic, and the fact that
Pachetti et al compared raw non-normalized genetic distances (instead of normalized
evolutionary rates) are the most likely explanation for this discrepancy.

Distribution of variable sites along the SARS-Cov-2 genome
Patterns of genomic variability were established on sliding windows of 100 bp in size and
overlapping by 50 bp, for all the clusters and super-clusters defined in this study. As shown
in Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure S10 , the observed patterns are remarkably similar
between all the clusters and super-clusters, suggesting common patterns of variation.
Density of polymorphic sites is significantly enriched (Adjusted Fisher test p-value ≤1e-15
and ≤1e-12 respectively) in both the 5’ and 3’ UTR regions, while protein coding loci (CDS)
show less variability. Strikingly, a single genomic region in the 3’ UTR accumulates ~10x
more mutations than any CDS, ~ 2x more than any other UTR region, and is the single most
variable region in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 7A). This highly variable genomic
region is associated with a conserved secondary structure (Figure 7A), already known in
literature and referred to as s2m.
S2m is a 41-nucleotide genetic element with a highly conserved secondary - as well as
primary and tertiary - structure, and has been described in several families of
single-stranded RNA viruses, including Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae and
Coronaviridae [58]. The molecular function of this potentially mobile structural element is not
well understood. Current hypotheses include hijacking of host protein synthesis through
interactions with ribosomal proteins [59], and RNA interference (RNAi) via processing of the
s2m elements into a mature microRNA [60]. In coronaviruses, the highly conserved nature
s2m has also allowed the development of a PCR-based virus discovery strategy [61].
As outlined in Figure 7B, compared to the consensus secondary structure of s2m described
in the Rfam database, the reference genome of SARS-CoV-2 harbors a nucleotide
substitution at a highly conserved and structurally important position, with possible impacts
on structural stability (the T at the SARS-CoV-2 genomic position 29,758, indicated by an
arrow in Figure 7A). Secondary structure predictions, based on the Vienna RNAfold
program, suggest that of all the secondary structures obtained by the possible 129 single
nucleotide substitutions in the presumably ancestral sequence of s2m as observed in the

genome of RaTG13 SARSr-CoV-2, this would be the second less stable structure in terms
of reduction of structural stability (Supplementary Table S7). Based on this observation and
on the high levels of variation of the entire s2m region, it is tempting to speculate that s2m
could be under diversifying selection in SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, we observe that the G->T
substitution at 29,742, which is a hallmark of cluster C11, would result in a substantially
increased stability of s2m (Supplementary Table S7), with an MFE that becomes
substantially lower than that of the s2m structure of the reference genome. Conversely, other
2 recurrent substitutions in s2m, 29,742 G->A and 29,734 G->T, which do not reach fixation
according to our criteria (having allele frequency ≤ 0.01) and are not associated with a
specific cluster of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, are predicted to result only in a marginal decrease
of the MFE of the s2m secondary structure (Supplementary Table S7). Interestingly, we
notice (​Figure 7C​) that the same consideration applies to the majority of the nucleotide
substitutions that are observed in the SARS-CoV-2 s2m element. Indeed, with respect to the
background of all possible nucleotide substitutions that could occur in s2m of the
SARS-CoV-2 reference genome, the set of variants that is actually found in extant
SARS-CoV-2 genomes seems to produce a less stable secondary structure.
A co-folding analysis of all distinct variants of the s2m elements found in the 11,633
complete and high quality genomes - according to the criteria defined in this study - suggest
a very degenerate secondary structure of s2m in SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 7D).
Notably while a substitution that restores the presumably ancestral state of s2m (i.e., the
secondary structure of RaTG13 SARSr-CoV-2) is observed (29753 T->G), this substitution is
associated only with a very limited number of genomes (AF=0.0012).

Discussion
Development of effective methods for the study of molecular data and the characterization of
pathogens genomic sequences and their evolution are of fundamental importance for
monitoring the spread and evolution of pathogens. The GISAID and Nextstrain portals
currently represent two invaluable resources for the sharing of genomic data of
SARS-CoV-2. Although both GISAID and Nexstrain incorporate methods for the
classification of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences, these systems are not ideal, since they
lack transparent and systematic sets of rules and can not easily be applied for the
systematic classification of novel genomic sequences.

In the current study we propose a rational and highly reproducible approach for the
classification of SARS-CoV-2 genomes, inspired by Multi Locus Strain Typing (MLST), a
molecular approach commonly used for the classification of pathogens [42]. Building on a
highly informative set of variable sites, which show high prevalence in the viral population,
our system is conceptually simple and represents a general and robust alternative to
methods based on phylogenetic analyses. Applying our system to the entire collection of
genomic sequences, as available on 28th May 2020, we derive interesting observations
concerning evolutionary patterns of SARS-CoV-2.
By comparison of more than 20,000 complete or nearly complete genomic sequences we
observe a reduced level of variability and a relatively low mutation rate (1.84 sites per 10​-3 nt
per year) in SARS-CoV-2.

Although this is consistent with previous reports of low

evolutionary rates in coronaviruses and SARSr-CoVs [26-50], considerations regarding the
rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, and possible biases in sampling of genomes from different
areas of the world, suggest that this estimate should be treated carefully, especially since it
is not known whether evolutionary rates are expected to remain stable in the event of a rapid
expansions of the viral population. This notwithstanding, the presence of different types of
SARS-CoV-2 genomes during the early phases of the pandemic (within 25 days of the report
of the first case of COVID19 in Wuhan) in several distinct geographic regions of China,
coupled with low levels of genomic variability, is suggestive of an early circulation of
SARS-CoV-2 in humans, probably well before the major outbreak of COVID19 in Wuhan.
The evolutionary rates estimated in this study, coupled with the number of observed
polymorphic sites would retrospectively date the spillover of SARS-CoV-2 in humans to
August-November 2019, an estimate that is consistent with other recent studies [62].
Careful monitoring of the evolutionary rates of SARS-CoV-2 over a longer period of time,
and ideally also on an unbiased/matched number of genomes isolated from different
geographic areas, are required to confirm these findings.
In this respect, the fact that a relevant number of SARS-CoV-2 high frequency polymorphic
sites are observed even in viral strains isolated from pangolins and bats specimens
highlights an unexplored diversity shared by SARS-CoV-2 and

SARSr-CoV-2 viral

genomes. This suggests that additional sampling of a larger number of non-human
specimens is required to reconstruct a more complete phylogeny and to possibly trace back
the “original” spillover event.

Indeed, notwithstanding

the high levels of similarity to

SARS-CoV-2 (in the order of 97%), RaTG13, the most closely related viral genome isolated
from a bat specimen, is supposed to have diverged from SARS-CoV-2 more than 25 to 40

years ago [63].
Our classification system, based on 50 high frequency polymorphic sites, identifies a total of
12 distinct clusters and 4 super-clusters of SARS-CoV-2 genome types, all having a highly
biased phylogeographic distribution (Figure 2-3). We note that several polymorphic sites that
are specifically associated (completely fixed) with clusters and super-clusters are predicted
to be either under positive or negative selection according to state of the art methods for the
study of evolutionary constraints in protein coding genes (Table 1). Interestingly, several of
these sites have been previously highlighted by other studies and tentatively associated with
increased virulence and/or increased mutation rates of SARS-CoV-2 [33-35].
While fixation of advantageous variants has previously been proposed as an effective and
widespread mechanism for the rapid increase of the fitness of a viral population [64], it
should be stressed that in the absence of extensive experimental validation, the functional
relevance of these genomic variants remains unclear at present. Especially, since reduced
levels of variability, high levels of recombination and, particularly, biased sampling of
genomic sequences, could impair the accuracy of methods based on phylogenetic
reconstruction of ancestral states for the identification of possible evolutionary signatures
[65-66].

In this respect, it should be stressed that our observation of reduced genetic

variability of “late” viral clusters belonging to SC3 and SC4 (Figure 5A), coupled with the
highly biased phylogeographic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 genome types (Figure 2-3), are
more consistent with genetic drift and founder effects rather than ongoing adaptive selection.
However,

the hypothesis that genetic drift accounts for a great part of SARS-CoV-2

variability does not exclude selection having driven a small number of fixed substitutions, so

Notably, we observe a highly consistent pattern of nucleotide substitution in SARS-CoV-2
genomes between all clusters and superclusters, characterized by an increased variability at
UTRs, in spite of the fact that a significant proportion of genomic assemblies annotated as
“full-length” in GISAID are incomplete at the terminal ends. Although this incomplete
representation of genomic sequences does not affect the classification system proposed in
this study, it might result in an inaccurate/incomplete representation of ongoing evolution of
SARS-CoV-2. This is exemplified by the s2m element, a highly conserved secondary
structure element located in the 3’ UTR which carries a substitution in the reference genome
of SARS-CoV-2 that destabilizes the secondary structure and is possibly deleterious. In the
absence of clear data on a function to be experimentally tested, it is very difficult to

speculate whether the s2m of SARS-CoV-2 maintains the same functional activity. However,
the substantial increase of genomic variability observed in the s2m locus, compared with the
rest of the genome, suggests that this element might be subject to ongoing widespread
diversifying selection in SARS-CoV-2, or at least have lost significant purifying constraints.
Patterns of single nucleotide substitutions in s2m provide contrasting evidence concerning
the evolutionary patterns of this secondary structure element in SARS-CoV-2, as the most
prevalent substitutions (29,742 G->T) seems to be associated with a considerable increase
in secondary structure stability, but the majority of the substitutions observed in extant
SARS-CoV-2 genomes are not optimal in terms of the recovery of a highly stable secondary
structure.
In conclusion several questions concerning the mechanisms of evolution and the phenotypic
characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 (increased/decreased virulence) remain open, in the
absence of rigorous experimental validations. However, by allowing a rapid and systematic
classification of

SARS-CoV-2

genome types, the approach here presented can be

extremely useful for a fine grained monitoring of the prevalence of different types of
SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, but also for the study of the molecular processes that underlie the
emergence of novel viral types

super-cluster SC4, calculated at different and non-overlapped intervals of 10 days (“T_”, with
time 0 = 26th December 2019, i.e., the collection date of the reference genome). Color
codes according to Figure 1. The barplots on the top indicate the number of genomes of
each super-cluster observed at each time interval considered.
Supplementary Figure S8: Phenetic patterns and geographic area of the first 50
genomes for each “early” cluster. ​Each heatmap displays presence/absence of the 50
high frequency polymorphic sites (AF >0.01, identified in the 11,633 “high quality” complete
SARS-CoV-2 genomes) in the first 50 genomes, in terms of date, of each early cluster​.
Genomic coordinates are represented on the X axis. Pink indicates a reference allele, red an
alternative allele for that site. Early cluster as defined in Table 3. Panels on the left indicate
continents: yellow=Asia, blue=Europe, pink=Africa, green=North America, orange=South
America, purple=Oceania. Country and date of collection are reported on the rows.
Supplementary Figure S9: Phenetic patterns and geographic area of the first 50
genomes for each “late” cluster. ​Each heatmap displays presence/absence of the 50 high
frequency polymorphic sites (AF >0.01,

identified in 11,633 “high quality” complete

SARS-CoV-2 genomes) in the first 50 genomes, in terms of date, of each late cluster.
Genomic coordinates are represented on the X axis. Pink indicates a reference allele, red an
alternative allele for that site.

Panels on the left indicate continents: yellow=Asia,

blue=Europe, pink=Africa, green=North America, orange=South America, purple=Oceania.
Country and date of collection are reported on the rows.
Supplementary Figure S10: ​Plot of genomic variability, calculated as the proportion of
variable sites identified in overlapping genomic windows of 100 bp in the twelve clusters
C1-C12​. Genomic coordinates are represented on the X axis, number of variable sites per
window on the Y axis. Color codes according to Figure 1.
