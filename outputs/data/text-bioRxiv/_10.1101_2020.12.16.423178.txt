Abstract

22

Since the first identification of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-

23

2) in China in late December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread fast

24

around the world. RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, have higher gene mutations than

25

DNA viruses during virus replication. Variations in SARS-CoV-2 genome could contribute to

26

efficiency of viral spread and severity of COVID-19. In this study, we analyzed the locations

27

of genomic mutations to investigate the genetic diversity among isolates of SARS-CoV-2 in

28

Gwangju. We detected non-synonymous and frameshift mutations in various parts of SARS-

29

CoV-2 genome. The phylogenetic analysis for whole genome showed that SARS-CoV-2

30

genomes in Gwangju isolates are clustered within clade V and G. Our findings not only

31

provide a glimpse into changes of prevalent virus clades in Gwangju, South Korea, but also

32

support genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 to aid in the development of efficient

33

therapeutic antibodies and vaccines against COVID-19.

Introduction

36

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a newly emerged virus, named

37

severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1, 2). Since its first

38

reporting on December 2019 in Hubei Province, China, COVID-19 has rapidly spread

39

globally, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic on March 11,

40

2020 (3). As of April 20, 2020, 2,995,758 human confirmed cases of COVID-19, including

41

204,987 deaths, have been reported from 213 countries (4). The first case in South Korea, a

42

Chinese visitor from Wuhan, was identified on January 20, 2020 (5, 6). On February 3, 2020,

43

the first case in the city of Gwangju, South Korea, was reported, and as of mid-July 2020, a

44

total of 171 confirmed cases have been identified.

45

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus (7). The SARS-

46

CoV-2 genome encodes 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) involved in virus replication and

47

four structural proteins, including envelope (E), matrix (M) and nucleocapsid (N) and spike

48

(S) (8). RNA viruses have higher mutation rates than DNA viruses (9). Mutations in the

49

SARS-CoV-2 genome are being continuously reported (10, 11), and these mutations may

50

affect pathogenesis. Therefore, it is critically important to monitor the genome evolution of

51

SARS-CoV-2. Investigation of the viral genomic variations is necessary to provide

52

epidemiological information on SARS-CoV-2 and for the development of therapeutics and

53

vaccines.

54

In this study, we isolated SARS-CoV-2 virus from COVID-19 patients in the city of Gwangju,

55

South Korea, and we investigated genomic mutations resulting in amino acid changes. To this

56

end, we performed full-genome sequencing using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) tool

57

and analyzed point mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We phylogenetically analyzed and

58

classified virus strains from confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients in the southwestern

59

region of Korea.

Welfare (MOHW). Clinical specimens were collected as oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal

66

swabs in viral transport medium or sputum from symptomatic patients with COVID-19. All

67

clinical samples were handled in biosafety cabinets. Viral RNA was extracted from the

68

samples using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The RNA was

69

quantified by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) method and

70

using a PowerChek 2019-nCoV Real-time Kit (Kogene Biotech, Seoul, South Korea).

71
72

Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)

73

RT-qPCR assays targeted the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and E genes.

74

Sequence information for the primers and probes used to detect these two genes is presented

75

in Table 1 (12). PCRs were run in 25-μL reaction mixtures containing 12.5 μL of 2X RT-PCR

76

buffer, 1 μL of 25X RT-PCR enzyme mixture included in AgPath-ID One-step RT-PCR

77

Reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 5 μL of RNA, and 1 μL of each primer/probe. The

78

PowerChek 2019-nCoV Real-time PCR Kit includes a primer/probe mixture (for RdRp and

79

E), a positive control template (for RdRp and E), and RT-qPCR premix. Sequences of the

80

primers and probe are not disclosed. The RT-qPCR master mix consists of 11 μL of RT-qPCR

81

premix, 4 μL of each primer/probe mixture, and 5 μL of RNA. The thermal cycling program

82

was as follows: reverse transcription at 50°C for 30 min, followed by inactivation of the

83

reverse transcription at 95°C for 10 min, and then 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1

84

min (7500 instrument; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). All samples were tested

85

in duplicate.

SARS-CoV-2 isolation from Vero cells

88

To isolate SARS-CoV-2 from Vero cells, the cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 2×104

89

cells/well and cultured in modified Eagle’s medium (MEM; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific,

90

USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) for 48 h.

91

Then, the medium was replaced with medium with a lower FBS concentration, and the cells

92

were further incubated for 24–48 h. Before inoculation onto the Vero cells, patient specimens

93

were diluted with viral transport medium containing penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) at a 1:4

94

ratio, incubated at 4°C 1 h with vortexing every 15 min, and then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm

95

for 30 min. Inoculated monolayers of Vero cells were incubated in MEM supplemented with

96

2% FBS at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO2. For seven days post inoculation, the cells were

97

observed for cytopathic effects (CPE) daily. When CPE were observed, the cells were scraped

98

with a micropipette tip and subjected to total nucleic acid extraction.

99
100

Next-generation sequencing

101

Ten cell supernatants containing viral particles and six clinical samples with a threshold cycle

102

(Ct) value of 10 or lower were used for genome analysis. Viral RNA was isolated using the

103

QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit and subjected to whole-genome sequencing. NGS libraries

104

were prepared and sequenced using Barcode-Tagged Sequencing (BTSeq) technology

105

(Celemics Inc., Seoul, Korea) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Complete genome

106

sequencing was conducted using the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA),

107

producing 150-bp pair-end reads per sample.

Phylogenetic analysis

110

Forty complete viral genome sequences were downloaded from the Global Initiative on

111

Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID; https://www.gisaid.org/) database, with

112

acknowledgment. Multiple alignment of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes was carried out using

113

Multiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation (MUSCLE). A phylogenetic tree was

114

generated by the neighbor-joining method using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis

115

across Computing Platforms (MEGA X) using the Kimura 2-parameter model, and the tree

116

evaluated using 1,000 bootstrap replicates.

117
118

Mutation analysis

119

A reference SARS-CoV-2 genome (hCoV-19/Wuhan-Hu-1/2019) of 29,903 nucleotides long

120

was obtained from the GISAID database and was used to identify mutations in the protein-

121

coding sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes of the Gwangju isolates. We analyzed 12

122

protein-coding sequences (ORF1a, ORF1b, S, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8,

123

N, and ORF10). The amino acid sequence was created by using hCoV-19/Wuhan-Hu-1/2019

124

annotated open reading frames (ORFs). Based on the protein annotations, amino acid codon

125

variants were converted from the nucleotide variants for alignments. Each protein domain

126

was aligned with the reference genome of SARS-CoV-2 using NCBI protein alignments.

130

For virus isolation, SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical specimens were inoculated into Vero cell

131

cultures. We observed CPE at 24-h intervals for 7 days post inoculation. CPE were first

132

observed and evident in Vero cells at 72–84 h after inoculation. When >80% of total cells

133

showed CPE, the cells were collected (day 6), and viral RNA was extracted.

134

For the detection of SARS-CoV-2, the RdRp and E genes were detected using RT-qPCR. A

135

positive RT-qPCR result was defined as a Ct value <37 for both genes. We successfully

136

isolated SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples collected from 10 COVID-19 patients in

137

Gwangju. The virus isolates were named hCoV-19/Gwangju/IHC_sample number/2020

138

(Table 2).

139
140

Phylogenetic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes

141

We performed phylogenetic analyses of 16 distinct SARS-CoV-2 sequences of isolates from

142

Gwangju and 40 sequences deposited in the GISAID database up to March 31, 2020 (Fig. 1).

143

According to GISAID data, three major clades of SARS-CoV-2, including S, V, and G, can be

144

identified (13). These three clades are determined by the amino acid substitutions present:

145

ORF8-L84S (S), ORF3a-G251V (V), and S-D614G (G).

146

In accordance with the above classification, we identified three clades (GH, GR, and V) on

147

the basis of the point mutations identified in the Gwangju sequences (Fig. 1). Clade V

148

included seven isolates from Gwangju. Five of these isolates (indicated in purple in Fig. 1,

149

IHC597, 610, 614, 685, and 719) were associated with the Shincheonji religious group, and

150

the remaining two (Fig. 1, IHC1215, and 1217) were related to another church in Gwangju.

151

As revealed by the epidemiologic information, the five isolates from this clade were related

152

to the spread during the early COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea. Specifically, in February

153

2020, the COVID-19 outbreak started in the city of Daegu, South Korea, and SARS-CoV-2

154

had rapidly spread within the religious group named the Shincheonji church of Jesus (14).

155

The G clade comprised nine of the 16 isolates (labeled green in Fig. 1). We identified two

156

subclades within clade G: GH, with seven isolates, and GR, with one isolate. Of the seven

157

confirmed cases related to the seven GH isolates, six were linked to cluster secondary

158

infections from door-to-door sales businesses at Geumyang Building (Fig. 1, IHC17695,

159

18094, 18561, 18670, 18755 and 20065). A Geumyang Building case led to a cluster outbreak

160

in Gwangju from late June to mid-July and further led to additional cases at the

161

Gwangneuksa temple, church, and at work. The remaining one case appeared to be associated

162

with international travel-related exposures (Fig. 1, IHC2681). The case related to the one

163

isolate in clade GR had a known international travel history (Fig. 1, IHC3486). Taken

164

together, these results reveal that the V clade of SARS-CoV-2 was the major clade type in

165

Gwangju during the early pandemic in South Korea, and as of mid-July, clade GH is the

166

predominant type in the southwestern region of South Korea.

167
168

Mutations identified in the sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes

169

We aimed to classify the distinct clades of SARS-CoV-2 and investigate the mutations in the

170

16 SARS-CoV-2 genomes of the Gwangju isolates. To this end, we analyzed 12 protein-

171

coding regions (ORF1a, ORF1b, S, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, N, and

172

ORF10). NGS revealed 21 non-synonymous mutations and 1 frameshift deletion compared to

173

the reference genome from a Wuhan isolate (NCBI GenBank: NC_045512). Mutation events

174

observed in the sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes are summarized in Table 3.

175

Clades V (ORF3a-G251V) and G (S-D614G) comprised seven and nine out of the 16

176

sequences of Gwangju isolates, respectively (Table 4). ORF8-L84S, representative of clade S,

177

was not observed in any of the 16 genomes. In addition to the G251V mutation in ORF3a and

178

the D614G mutation in S, we analyzed 19 additional point mutations in ORF1a, ORF1b,

179

ORF3a, ORF7a, S, and N. For these 19 genetic mutations, 11 mutation sites were found in

180

ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode nsp1–16, occupying two-thirds of the entire genome (Fig.

181

2).

182

We first analyzed the mutations in ORF1a/b, and we identified six mutation types in ORF1a

183

(Table 3). Among them, the most common mutations were ORF1a-T265I (in seven samples,

184

IHC2681, 17695, 18094, 18561, 18670, 18755, and 20065), ORF1a-L3606F (in seven

185

samples, IHC597, 610, 614, 685, 719, 1215, and 1217) and ORF1a-S3884L (in six samples,

186

IHC17695, 18094, 18561, 18670, 18755, and 20065). In particular, we found that ORF1a-

187

L3606F co-occurred with ORF3a-G251V, which determines clade V (Table 3). Further,

188

M1769I, A968V, and L2609F occurred in nsp3 within ORF1a. Mutations within nsp2 and

189

nsp3 may play a role in differentiating infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV (15). In

190

addition, we detected five mutations in ORF1b. P323L in nsp12 and Q2412L were observed

191

in nine (IHC2681, 3127, 3486, 17695, 18094, 18561, 18670, 18755, and 20065) and six

192

(IHC17695, 18094, 18561, 18670, 18755, and 20065) genome sequences, respectively. We

193

also identified A449V and M633V in nsp12 and A1652V. The Nsp12 gene of SARS-CoV-2

194

encodes the RdRp protein essential for the virus replication machinery.

195

The remaining eight point mutations were found in ORF3a, ORF7a, S, and N. Four mutations,

196

R195K, R203K, G204R, and T366I, were detected in the N protein, which participates in

197

viral RNA genome packaging and viral particle release (16). Among them, G204R was

198

observed together with ORF1b-P323L in the genome sequence of hCoV-

199

19/Gwangju/IHC3486/2020 (Table 3). Based on GISAID data, two subclades, GR and GH,

200

belonging clade G, were determined by two mutations (N-G204R and ORF1b-P323L) and

201

one mutation (ORF3a-Q57H), respectively. This indicates that isolate hCoV-

202

19/Gwangju/IHC3486/2020 can be classified into clade GR. Apart from the ORF3a-G251V

203

and S-D614G substitutions, the single point mutations of Q57H in ORF3a and P589S in S

204

were detected. In particular, ORF3a-Q57H, the signature of the GH clade, was detected in

205

seven Gwangju genomes. In the ORF7a region, we confirmed two mutations; ORF7a-G26D

206

and ORF7a-P84S.

207

In addition to the above 19 point mutations, we identified a 92-nucleotide deletion in ORF7a

208

of hCoV-19/Gwangju/IHC3127/2020, resulting in out-of-frame deletion. The SARS-CoV

209

ORF7a ortholog is an inhibitor of bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST-2), which is capable

210

of restricting virus release from cells and induces apoptosis (17). According to this previous

211

study, our observation implies that the deletion in ORF7a might affect the SARS-CoV-2

212

pathogenesis. However, further studies are needed to characterize the mechanisms underlying

213

ORF7a functional alteration.

214
215

Conclusions

216

We for the first time successfully isolated SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 patients in the

217

southwestern region of South Korea. According to viral clade classification based on GISAID

218

data, SARS-CoV-2 in Gwangju mainly belong to the V and G clades. More specifically,

219

during the initial breakout in February 2020, the V clade was major clade type, mainly due to

220

spread in the Shincheonji religious group. Since July 2020, the GH clade, related to door-to10

221

door sales, became the prevalent type. In addition, we identified 21 non-synonymous

222

mutations and one frameshift deletion. This study provided the first genomic mutation

223

analysis in SARS-CoV-2 isolated from patients in Gwangju, South Korea. It is important to

224

analyze and share the genome characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 for interpreting alterations in

225

infectivity, pathogenicity, and host-virus interactions by continuous monitoring of the genetic

226

mutations. Future studies including additional genome sequences are needed to define the

227

further evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Gwangju.

Fig 1. Phylogenetic analysis of 56 representative SARS-CoV-2 genomes, including sequences

302

of viruses collected in the city of Gwangju, South Korea (green and purple). Clades S, V, and

303

G were determined based on significant amino acid mutations (ORF8-L84S, ORF3a-G251V,

304

and S-D614G, respectively). The G clade was classified into a GR clade, a GH clade, and

305

other strains. Multiple sequence alignment was achieved using MUSCLE. The phylogenetic

306

tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method using MEGA X and the Kimura 2-

307

parameter model. The best tree was found by performing 1,000 bootstrap replicates.
