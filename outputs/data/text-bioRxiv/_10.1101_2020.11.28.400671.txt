Abstract
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic infection
that emerged in the Middle East in 2012. Symptoms range from mild to severe and
include both respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses. The virus is mainly present in
camel populations with occasional spill overs into humans. The severity of infection
in humans is influenced by numerous factors and similar to severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) underlying health complications can play a
major role. Currently, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are co-incident in the Middle
East and a rapid way is required of sequencing MERS-CoV to derive genotype
information for molecular epidemiology. Additionally, complicating factors in MERSCoV infections are co-infections that require clinical management. The ability to
rapidly characterise these infections would be advantageous. To rapidly sequence
MERS-CoV, we developed an amplicon-based approach coupled to Oxford
Nanopore long read length sequencing. The advantage of this approach is that
insertions and deletions can be identified – which are the major drivers of genotype
change in coronaviruses. This and a metagenomic approach were evaluated on
clinical samples from patients with MERS. The data illustrated that whole genome or
near whole genome information on MERS-CoV could be rapidly obtained. This
approach provided data on both consensus genomes and the presence of minor
variants including deletion mutants. Whereas, the metagenomic analysis provided
information of the background microbiome.

Introduction
Coronaviruses were once described as the backwater of virology as they did not
cause extensive disease in humans. However, with the emergence of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in China in 2003, Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and now
SARS-CoV-2 originating in 2019 in China, this is clearly not the case. These viruses
cause respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses and share similar genome
architectures and disease profiles. Severe infection in humans is typified by cytokine
storms1,2, pneumonia and kidney failure. MERS-CoV has been identified by the
WHO as a prioritised disease and is on their list of pathogens for research and
development in emergency contexts. With the advent of SARS-CoV-2 there is an
urgent and unmet healthcare need to develop generic medical countermeasures to
combat these infections and mitigate future outbreaks, particularly in contact tracing
and understanding transmission dynamics. As a consequence, these viruses cripple
national infrastructure, trigger city-wide transport curfews and disrupt international
travel and commerce. Many countries are at risk for both SARS-CoV-2 and MERSCoV.

There are striking parallels between the emergence of all three of these viruses. For
example, one of the major concerns with MERS-CoV is the potential spread of the
virus and other pathogens during Hajj3. This is an annual Islamic pilgrimage to
Mecca in Saudi Arabia, involving some 2 million of the world’s population, and
approximately 0.5 million Saudi residents. There are constant spill over events from
camels into humans, and the geographical distribution of MERS-CoV in dromedaries
is increasing either through spread and/or increased surveillance. Currently no
antiviral therapies or vaccines are licensed for treatment or prevention of coronavirus
infection

in

humans.

Several

countermeasures for MERS-coronavirus infection. These have included compounds
already in use in the clinic, such as combination of interferon-α2b and ribavirin4. A
phase 1 DNA vaccine, based on the viral spike glycoprotein, funded by US
Department of the Army, has been recently evaluated in a human trial 5 and also in
dromedary camels6. Additionally, a Phase 1 clinical trial has started in humans in

Saudi Arabia assessing the safety and tolerability of a vaccine based on the
ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine7,8. The sporadic nature of the outbreaks and the lack of
suitable animal models has hindered research.

Given the lack of medical counter measures, shutting down transmission changes is
essential in bringing such outbreaks under control 9, and sequencing the genomes of
viruses can aid in this through molecular epidemiology, as was demonstrated with
SARS-CoV in Singapore10,11. This approach can also be used to identify properties
of the virus relevant to health authorities, including the rate of virus evolution and
whether targets of medical counter measures remain stable and valid. During the
2013-2016 West African Ebola virus outbreak, high resolution sequencing using
Illumina12 and then long-read length/MinION13 based sequencing was used to
provide measures of virus evolution 12. The data also showed the origin of the
outbreak was a single zoonotic transmission event and was spread through
subsequent human to human transmission in Guinea and to surrounding
countries12,14. The utility of the portable MinION based approach for rapid contact
tracing was demonstrated in the West African outbreak through shutting down
transmission chains arising from sexual contact 15. Likewise, MinION based
sequencing proved crucial in the 2018 Nigerian Lassa fever outbreak to show that
independent transmission events from rodents rather than human to human contact
was responsible for the spread of the outbreak16. MinION sequencing is also used
for deriving consensus genomes for SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples17,18.

Thus, providing sequence information of the genomes of viruses (or pathogens in
general), is informative for health authorities, but only if the data is provided in real or
near real time. Also, geopolitical considerations must be taken into consideration in
terms of sample ownership and data sharing19, especially given the Helsinki
Declaration. MERS-CoV is highly transmissible20 and sporadic outbreaks are
ongoing in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and surrounding regions. Working with
clinical specimens can prove challenging, particularly in understanding the pathology
of MERS-CoV in how viral load and which co-infections influence outcome and the
severity of this infectious disease. In order to aid in the diagnosis of MERS-CoV, and
to rapidly generate viral genome sequence, the application of an amplicon-based
and metagenomic MinION sequencing approach was to sequence viral RNA. During

replication of coronaviruses the approximately 30 kb positive sense RNA genome, a
nested set of subgenomic mRNAs are synthesized. Subgenomic mRNAs located
toward the 3’ end of the genome are generally more abundant than transcripts
nearer the 5’ end21,22. The data demonstrated that whole genome or near whole
genome information on MERS-CoV could be rapidly obtained from samples taken
from infected patients and sequenced using the amplicon approach. Further, the
amplicon-based sequencing approach provided data on both consensus genomes
and the presence of minor variants including deletion mutants. Metagenomic
analysis provided information of the background microbiome and how this was
associated with outcome. Real time analysis of the microbiome in patients and the
identification of antibiotic resistance markers may provide better chemotherapeutic
approaches to manage co-infections.

Methods
Ethics statement
Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board no 18-102, King
Fahad Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Informed consent to participant was not
required since only remaining left-over samples were used for this study.

Sample collection and processing
Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA), oropharyngeal, tracheal aspirates, throat swabs
were collected from MERS-CoV positive patients (25–70 years old) admitted to
different hospitals within Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV diagnosis was confirmed by
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Biomerieux diagnostics).
For this study, the NPAs with a confirmed MERS-CoV diagnosis from the Ministry of
Health

(MOH)

Saudi

Arabia,

had

no

identifying

information.

The

NPA,

oropharyngeal, tracheal aspirates, throat swabs sampling were carried out as per the
MOH’s guidelines. Samples were stored at −80 oC until use. RNA from the NPA was
extracted using EZ1 Virus Mini Kit v2 (Qiagen [955134]). The RNA concentration
was measured by the Qubit RNA BA assay (Qiagen [32852]). Information on
samples from patients use in this study is included in Table 1. This includes the sex,
age, hospital, specimen type, Ct value of the E gene and ORF1AB, comorbidities,
outcome and whether the patient was in an intensive care unit.
Virus stock generation and infection
To prepare RNA from virus infected cells as a control for amplification, the MRC-5
cell lines was infected with MERS-CoV (ERASMUS strain) at a MOI of 5. Total RNA
was purified using the Trizol method.

DNase Treatment of RNA
RNA samples were treated with Turbo DNase (Invitrogen), by adding 1 l of TURBO
DNase with 5 l 10x buffer in a 56 l reaction. The reaction was incubated at 37 oC
for 30 minutes. 5 l of inactivating agent was added and incubated at room
temperature for 2 minutes. The reaction was centrifuged at 10,000g for 90s and the
RNA supernatant was transferred into a new tube.

Primer design and synthesis
Primers for the generation of overlapping amplicons were designed using the
Primer3Plus platform and re-checked again by Primer Blast (NCBI) to avoid primers
with a high self-complementary score. Primers were synthesized by Eurofins
Genomics (the sequence of the primers is shown Table 2). The stock concentration
was 100 M, and primers were diluted in DNase/RNase free H 2O to make a 10 M
working concentration.

cDNA synthesis and PCR
Superscript IV reverse transcriptase (Thermofisher [18090010]) and random
hexamers (2.5 M) were used to generate cDNA templates from RNA. cDNA was
amplified using Q5-high fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB [M0491]).
Amplicon analysis and sequencing
PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer to confirm the presence
of amplicons. The amplicons generated from an individual patient were pooled and
cleaned using AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter [A63882]) following the
manufacturer’s instructions before preparing the sequencing library with the Ligation
Sequencing Kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies [SQK-LSK109]). The sequencing
library was added to a Flow cell connected to a MinIT and sequencing was initiated
through MinKNOW. An initial rapid base calling setting was used.

SISPA
RNA was reverse-transcribed with SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen)
using Sol-PrimerA (5′-GTTTCCCACTGGAGGATA-N9-3′), followed by second-strand
DNA synthesis with Klenow (NEB). Reaction conditions for Round A were as follows:
1 μL of SolPrimerA (40 pmol/μL) was added to 4 μL of sample RNA, heated at 65 °C
for 5 min, then cooled on ice for 5 min. Then 7 μL of SuperScript Master Mix (4ul
5XSSIV Buffer, 1ul 100mM DTT, 1ul RNaseOUT(Invitrogen) and 1ul SuperScriptTM
IV Reverse Transcriptase (200U/ul) was added and incubated at 23 °C for 10
minutes, then 50°C for 10 minutes. Reaction was inactivated by incubating at 80°C
for 10 minutes. For second strand synthesis, Klenow Fragment (NEB) as in
Chrzastek et al. (2017) was used. The cDNA from each reaction was purified using a

1:1 ratio of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, USA). 5ml cDNA was amplified
with Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB) according to manufacturer’s
instructions with Primer Sol-B. Cycling conditions were as follows; 98 °C for 30 s,
followed by 30 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, with a
final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. All amplified cDNA was purified using a 1:1 ratio
of AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, USA), and resuspended in 25 ml. Purified
cDNA was quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS assay (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer's instruction.
Bioinformatics
Fast5 files were base called again using Guppy to mitigate for the lower accuracy
associated with the rapid base calling setting initially used on the MinIT. To
investigate deletions in the MERS-CoV genome, library reads were filtered by
expected amplicon size and then aligned to the NCBI MERS reference
NC_019843.3 using minimap2 as per the artic pipeline and SVIM was used to
identify deletions18.

In addition, samtools was used to sort and index the alignment files, picard was used
to remove amplification duplicates then a custom perl script was used count the
nucleotides at each position on the reference genome, when the mapping quality
was above 10. Data was visualised using R studio using the ggplot2. To consider the
minor variation, the nucleotide depth at a single position with less than 20 counts
was not taken forward into analysis to mitigate for random sequencing errors.

For rapid assessment of the meta-transcriptome approach, Fastq files were
uploaded to Oxford Nanopore Technology’s (ONT's) cloud-based pipeline EPI2ME
(Fastq Antimicrobial Resistance; WIMP (rev. 3.4.0), ARMA CARD (rev. 1.1.6))
workflow to retrieve taxonomy classification and antimicrobial resistance information
from MERS-CoV clinical samples.

In addition, meta-transcriptomic reads were assessed with Kraken2. Host removal
was carried out to remove human reads. The Human genome assembly
GRCh38.p13 was used as a reference. The Human genome assembly was indexed
with minimap2 using the parameter “-ax map-ont”23. The quality-controlled Oxford

Nanopore fastq reads were mapped to the indexed human genome assembly with
minimap2 using default parameters. The resulting sam file was sorted and converted
to bam with the command “samtools sort”24. A fastq file with unmapped reads was
produced with the “samtools fastq” command with the parameter “-f 4”24
The quality controlled, host removed reads were classified using Kraken2 25. The
standard kraken output and sample report output files were produced with the
options “--output” and “--report” respectively. The database used during Kraken
classification consisted of the “bacteria” and “viral” kraken2 reference libraries (built
23rd April 2020). Visualisation of the Kraken2 output was carried out with Pavian,
utilising

Kraken-biom

(https://github.com/smdabdoub/kraken-biom) was used to generate a biom table
which was then read into R studio with Phyloseq to plot alpha diversity and
abundance of species identified in the clinical samples at the genus level 27. DESeq2
was used to compare the difference in abundance of species between fatal (n=7)
and non-fatal (n=7) MERS-CoV infections28.

Results and Discussion
Coronaviruses encode several proteins that are involved in proof reading during
virus replication29,30, therefore using nucleotide divergence for contact tracing may
be problematic. Recombination and resulting deletions (and potentially insertions)
may account for the wide genome diversity observed in some strains of
coronaviruses31-33. These recombination events can led to new strains of
coronaviruses34 or potentially affect vaccine strategies35,36. In order to identify these
genome changes with sequencing, rapid long read length approaches offered by
Oxford Nanopore were advantageous. Sample quality can also inform design of
sequencing strategies and a RT-PCR approach was used to recover viral
genome/transcript information. Rather than designing very short amplicons, longer
amplicons were selected through selection of appropriate primer pairs along the
MERS-CoV genome (Fig. 1).

Primer design
Twenty MERS-CoV genome sequences were aligned with a reference sequence
(NC_019843.3 – the ‘Erasmus Medical Centre (EMC)’ sequence). These sequences
represented viruses collected in regions of Saudi Arabia and countries that reported
cases including South Korea. Primer binding sites were chosen from conserved
regions after alignment, so that a minimum of roughly 1000 bp sequential amplicons
would be generated with an approximately 200 bp overlapping region at each
terminus. This resulted in the selection of thirty sets of primer pairs (Table 2) that
could be used to walk across the MERS-CoV genome with overlap between each
generated amplicon. Alternatively, primer pairs can be selected that allowed the
generation of larger amplicons that spanned more of the genome in contiguous
reads (Fig. 1).

Validation of primers and generation of amplicons using total RNA purified
from MERS-CoV infected cells
To evaluate the utility of the selected primers for the amplification of viral RNA under
controlled conditions, RNA was purified from MRC-5 cells that had been infected
with the EMC strain of MERS-CoV at a MOI of 5. Infection was carried out under
CL3+ conditions and total RNA purified from these infected MRC5-cells at 16 hrs

post-infection. This RNA was used as a template to prime cDNA synthesis using
random hexamers. Primer pairs (Table 2) were tested by gradient PCR to determine
the optimum annealing temperature (data not shown). This resulted in amplification
conditions (Table 3) such that the MERS-CoV genome was amplified using either 30
amplicons (Fig. 2A), 15 amplicons (Fig. 2B) or 8 amplicons (Fig. 2C), using the same
set of conditions for each set of amplicons (Table 2). The rationale being that using
the same amplification conditions across all primer pairs would be more efficient if
large scale sample analysis was required. The data indicated that for the 30amplicon approach, PCR products were observed that spanned the MERS-CoV
genome. For the 15 and 8 amplicon approach products were also observed that
spanned the MERS-CoV genome. However, amplification of these products varied in
efficiency.
Generation of amplicons from patients infected with MERS-CoV and derivation
of consensus genome sequence
The 30, 15 and 8 amplicon approach was evaluated to generate PCR products from
MERS-CoV RNA extracted from nasal aspirates taken from patients with MERS. The
rationale for MERS-CoV genome coverage using different size amplicons was to
provide maximum versatility for walking across the genome to obtain sequence
information. Note that this approach would also use the nested set of subgenomic
mRNAs to capture sequence information. The data indicated that the 30 and 15
approach could be used to generate fragments from clinical samples (Fig. 3A and
3B, respectively). The 8-amplicon approach was not sufficient for obtaining coverage
across the MERS-CoV from a clinical sample (data not shown). The PCR products
generated in the 30 and 15 amplicon approach (from separate patients) were
combined for each patient, barcoded and sequenced on separate flow cells for each
patient. Sequencing reads generated by the MinION were aligned to a reference
sequence. The analysis showed that complete genome sequence could be obtained
from the 30 amplicon (Fig. 4A) and 15 amplicon approach (Fig. 4B). Consensus
sequence was generated using the ARTIC bioinformatic pipeline. A custom perl
script was used to count the number of each nucleotide against the reference
sequence (NC_019843.3), to identify the viral genome sequence that dominated the
population. This sequence was used to generate a bespoke consensus genome for
an individual patient.

Analysis of the minor variant population within patients
The nucleotide substitution rate can drive the selection of genotypic and phenotypic
variants of MERS-CoV. Whilst variation and potential functional changes in
consensus genomes have been compared between patients, the ability to monitor
minor variants and their frequency and how these contribute to the overall viral
phenotype within a patient is unknown. The minor variant population in infection has
been shown to influence the kinetics of virus replication and be associated with
patient outcome37. Therefore, methodologies were developed that could be used to
assess the minor variant frequency within a sample from a patient. The custom perl
script used to call the consensus also revealed the nucleotide depth and the counts
of each nucleotide at each position (Fig. 5). The depth was used to normalise the
mutation frequency into a proportion instead of a raw count, allowing comparison for
samples of different read depth. Nucleotides that had a count less than 20 were
removed from analysis. As proof of principle, this approach was applied to the
sequencing data obtained from patients 10 and 115. Patient 10 appeared to have
more base changes in comparison to patient 115 (Fig. 6). Transitions (A>G, G>A,
C>U, U>C) were more frequently observed and C>U seemed more prominent than
other mutations. This is consistent with mRNA editing by APOBEC. APOBEC3 family
members have been shown to be involved in restricting the growth of human
coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63)38 and identified as potential drivers of C to U
transitions in SARS-CoV-239. We would note that assessing minor variant
populations using data from MinION sequencing may be problematic due to the
higher error rate in sequencing than for example Illumina based approaches13.
However, with sufficient read depth in a sample, an overview of the minor variant
frequency/population can still be obtained.
Identification and analysis of deletions in the viral genome in samples from
patients
Sequencing data from patients 10 and 115 were interrogated for deletions using
SVIM. Table 4 shows deletions identified with more than 5 supporting reads. Patient
10 had five deletions in Orf1ab and a deletion spanning N. Patient 115 was
sequenced with the 15-amplicon approach and therefore generated amplicons over
2kb in length. A deletion of 77 bases that spans the orf4b and orf5 gene was
identified in patient 115. Deletions in this region may have implications on virus

pathogenesis, ORF4A is able to inhibit early antiviral responses (IFN α/β) in the
host40, likewise ORF5 has been characterised to reduce inflammation responses 41.
This finding was consistent in both bioinformatic pipelines that were used. Several
deletion candidates were identified in patient 10 in Orf1ab and N.
Identification of bacterial and viral sequences in samples from patients and
antibiotic resistance markers
RNA was extracted from respiratory samples taken from 15 patients with severe
MERS, including combined nasal and oropharyngeal swabs (n=9), throat swab
(n=1), nasal swabs (n=4), and tracheal aspirate (n=1). Metagenomic approaches
have been used to identify the microbiome in samples from patients and correlate
these with patient outcome42. SISPA was used to identify bacterial and viral
transcripts present within the clinical samples. This was assessed using the real-time
analysis pipelines Epi2Me with AMR or Kraken and Phyloseq packages. Species
such as Acinetobacter baumanni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus
pneumoniae were identified, all of which can be associated with bacterial
pneumonia. Fig. 9 illustrates the top 20 species identified across all 15 samples.
Although detection of RNA does not always infer active infection, it provides insight
of the potential causative agent for a bacterial pneumonia if one was to emerge.

Patients with Acinetobacter transcripts identified were associated with fatal outcome
of disease (Fig. 9). Acinetobacter infections are often exclusive to healthcare
settings, especially in patients who have received ventilation support. Acinetobacter
species are considered as a serious multidrug resistant pathogen and is
encompassed in the “ESKAPE” acronym, referring to Enterococcus faecium,
Staphylococcus

aureus,

Klebsiella

pneumoniae,

Acinetobacter

baumannii,

Pseudomonas aerginosa and Enterbacter spp43. Evidence for antibiotic resistant
genes were identified in patient 6 within Klebsiella pneumoniae (TEM-4) and
Acinetobacter baumannii species (LpxC, adeI, adeJ, mexT, adeN, adeK, ADC-2)
(Table 5). This patient died from a severe MERS infection; the impact of the potential
co-infection is not known. Several groups have suggested that the widespread of
antibiotics as part of the management of patients with COVUD-19 may effect
antimicrobial resistance (AMR)44. Metagenomic analysis of samples from patients
with severe coronavirus infection, as illustrated in this study, can be used to track

these markers.

Human alphaherpesvirus 1 transcripts were identified in patient 5

through this approach. Ongoing research throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic
suggests that coronaviruses may be able to reactivate herpes simplex virus and
cytomegalovirus during severe disease44.

The abundance of bacteria was compared between fatal cases and non-fatal cases
using DESeq2 (Fig. 10). In general, bacteria from the Proteobacteria phyla were in
higher abundance in the fatal cases in comparison to non-fatal, including species
from the Acinetobacter and Klebsiella genera. Previous studies have suggested
interactions between viral infections and bacterial communities. An increase in
abundance of Proteobacteria was observed following an experimental rhinovirus
infection in COPD patients45. Patients with 2009 influenza A H1N1 infections and
pneumonia, were found to have an expansion of Proteobacteria in comparison to
non-viral pneumonias46-48. The data indicated that an amplicon-based approach
could be used to rapidly sequence MERS-CoV from clinical samples and provide
information on genetic diversity and insertions/deletions. This was complemented
with a metagenomic approach that was able to resolve the microbiome present in the
clinical sample. This analysis identified bacteria associated with ventilation and also
antibiotic resistance markers. Overall, the research demonstrates the utility of rapid
long read length sequence to characterise MERS-CoV infection in samples from
humans with MERS.

Table 5: Antimicrobial resistant genes identified in bacteria from patients with MERS-CoV infection. A Sequence-Independent,
Single Primer Amplification (SISPA) method was used to identify viral and bacterial transcripts within clinical samples. Fastq files
were uploaded to Oxford Nanopore Technology’s (ONT's) cloud-based pipeline EPI2ME (Fastq Antimicrobial Resistance; WIMP
(rev. 3.4.0), ARMA CARD (rev. 1.1.6)) workflow to retrieve taxonomy classification and antimicrobial resistance information from
MERS-CoV clinical samples. Antimicrobial resistant gene candidates with more than 5 alignments and an average accuracy of
more than 90% are presented.

Fig. 6. The sequencing reads were mapped to the patient consensus viral genome
sequence. The custom script counted the number of each base at each genome
position with a quality score >10. Positions with a depth <20 were removed from the
analysis. This figure shows the proportion of base changes observed in comparison
to the patient’s dominant consensus reference genome. Overall, transitions were
observed more frequently than transversions, where C>U is the most observed
base-change. We hypothesise that although transitions are more common, that
APOBEC may have an influence on the MERS-CoV genome. Patient 10; dark grey,
Patient 115; light grey, outliers not visualised.

Fig. 9: The top 20 species categorised into genus from 15 patients with severe
MERS infection. Human reads were removed from sequencing libraries, and viral
and bacterial transcripts were identified using Kraken2. Kraken2 outputs were
converted into biom format before importing into R with Phyloseq. Relative
abundance of each species is plotted for each patient. (+) MERS-CoV reads
detected, (-) MERS-CoV reads not detected.

Fig. 10: Up and down regulated abundance of bacteria in fatal cases of MERS-CoV
infections in comparison to non-fatal cases. Phyloseq object was converted into a
DESeq2 object and a contrast between fatal and non-fatal outcome was used to
calculate log2 fold change, values with an FDR <0.01 were plotted.

X axis

represents the genus of identified transcripts, unassigned refers to transcripts that
cannot be assigned at the genus level, however, colour illustrates the phyla.
