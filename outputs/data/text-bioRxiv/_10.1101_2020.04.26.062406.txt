How did SARS-CoV-19 spread in India from Italy, Iran and China? Genetic surveillance
of early cases and virus demography

Abstract

32

SARS-CoV-19 after emerging from Wuhan, drastically devastated all sectors of human life by

33

crushing down the global economy and increased psychological burden on public, government,

34

and healthcare professionals. We manifested by analyzing 35 early coronavirus cases of India,

35

that virus introduction in India, occurred from Italy, Iran and China and population demography

36

apparently revealed a rapid population expansion after the outbreak with a present steady growth.

37

We depicted nucleotide substitutions in structural genes, drove for the adaptive selection and

38

plead for sequencing more genomes to facilitate identification of new emerged mutants, genetic

39

evolution and disease transmission caused by coronavirus.

Introduction

43

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged at Wuhan city

44

of China in the early December of 2019 [1], resulted out high fatality and incapacitated health

45

systems by causing respiratory illness in human [2]. The virus spread rapidly after the outbreak

46

and took a heavy toll on human life, by causing 187 705 deaths over 213 Countries, areas or

47

territories till dated 25th April 2020 [3]. World Health Organization (WHO) declared SARS-

48

CoV-2 as a global pandemic and issued guidelines to develop cost effective candidate

49

therapeutics for diagnosis of coronavirus. The SARS-CoV-2, being zoonotic in nature, originated

50

from bats [4] and transmitted to human through pangolins as possible intermediate host [1].

51

Study suggests that East Asian populations plausibly contained different susceptibility to

52

coronavirus due to relatively higher ACE2 expression in tissues, a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [5].

53

Due to severe havoc caused by coronavirus, scientists across the globe started analyzing viral

54

genomes to address evolutionary history [6], phylogenetic relationship [7, 8], virus evolution [9]

55

and entry routes in different countries [10, 11]. In this context, the Global Initiative on Sharing

56

Avian Influenza Data (GISAID; https://www.gisaid.org/), founded in 2006, developed a

57

dedicated coronavirus repository in December 2019.

58

In India, the very first case was reported from a medical student of Thrissur, Kerala

59

having travel history of returning to India from Wuhan on 24th January, 2020. The second and

60

third cases were also reported from Kerala with Wuhan travel history [12]. Eventually, many

61

incidences emerged from different parts of the country with an official record of 19868 active

62

cases, 5803 cured with 824 deaths over 32 States/ Union Territories of India till 26th April 2020,

63

08:00 GMT+5:30 (https://www.mygov.in/covid-19/?cbps=1). We aimed to investigate the first

64

few possible waves of coronavirus introduced to India, by assigning the early cases to their

65

source of origin and investigate virus demography and adaptive potential by mapping nucleotide

66

substitutions in their structural proteins.

67

Materials and methods

68

Data mining

69

We downloaded 35 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 available from India, one each of bat

70

and pangolin SARS-related coronavirus, SARSr-CoV (EPI_ISL_402131 and EPI_ISL_410721)

71

from the GISAID database (table S1). These sequences also include the first two cases of SARS-

72

CoV-2 (EPI_ISL_413522 and EPI_ ISL_413523) identified from Kerala. In addition, we

73

included the first Wuhan 1 reference sequence, (henceforth, Wuhan-Hu-1; GenBank ID-

74

MN908947.3), three of the first 16 cases observed in Italy (EPI_ISL_417447, EPI_ISL_417445,

75

EPI_ISL_417446) and a reference genome from Iran (EPI_ISL_424349). All sequences were

76

aligned using MUSCLE v3.8.31, with the Wuhan-Hu-1 [13].

77

Genetic diversity, phylogenetic relationship and network analyses

78

Genetic diversity estimates i.e. number of polymorphic sites (P), mean number of pairwise

79

nucleotide differences (K), haplotype (Hd) and nucleotide diversity (π) were calculated using

80

DnaSP v6.12 [14]. Bayesian based phylogenetic analysis was performed using BEAST v1.10.4

81

[15] with strict clock following HKY substitution model and 107 MCMC simulations. Median-

82

joining network [16] was obtained using NETWORK v4.5.1.0 to study distribution and

83

relationship among the haplotypes with default values for the epsilon parameter (epsilon = 0).

84

Demography assessment

85

Parameters like mismatch distribution test, Harpending’s raggedness index (Rg) and Sum of

86

Squared Deviations (SSD) were calculated to test for demographic expansion using Arlequin

87

v3.5 [17]. Neutrality tests, Tajima’s D [18] and Fu’s Fs [19], to evaluate demographic effects

88

were carried out using DnaSP v6.12 [14]. To date changes in the effective population size over

89

time, we used Coalescent Bayesian Skyline Plot (BSP) analysis as implemented in BEAST v.

90

2.5 [20] with 8 × 10^-4 subs per site per year substitution rate [8, 21]. Markov chains were run for

91

2.5 × 107 generations and sampled at every 1000 generations, with the first 1000 samples

92

discarded as burn-in. Other parameters were set as default values and output was visualized in

93

the TRACER v. 1.6 [27].

94

Mapping nucleotide substitutions in Structural proteins

95

We mapped mutations occurred in the Spike protein, considered imperative for the adaptive

96

selection [9, 28] using a dedicated, Coronavirus Typing tool of Genome Detective v.1.13 [29],

97

which also maps genetic diversity and mutations with respect to the query sequence. This tool

98

takes in to account Blast and Phylogenetic methods to characterize genomes and corresponding

99

genotypes and identifies both protein and codon mutations in each gene. We classified nucleotide

100

substitutions (dN/dS ratio) in all sequences, with bat RaTG13, Pangolin- SARSr-CoV, SARS

101

and MERS using synonymous nonsynonymous analysis programme, SNAP v.2.1.1 [30]. The

102

dN/dS ratio evaluates the selection pressure, rate of genetic adaptation between structural genes

103

of the diverged species of coronaviruses. If, natural selection promotes and drives for virus

104

mutation by means of fixing non-synonymous change in the protein, the dN/dS ratio is expected

105

to be greater than one, if it suppresses the mutation is expected to be eliminated by purifying

106

selection; the ratio is expected to be less than one.

107

Results and discussion

108

Genetic polymorphism, phylogeny and network analyses

109

We obtained 24 haplotypes, 77 polymorphic sites, average nucleotide difference of 10.62 with

110

0.937 haplotype diversity and 0.00036 nucleotide diversity (table S2). The high haplotype

111

diversity with low nucleotide diversity suggests a recent divergence and high evolutionary

112

potential in coronavirus. Bayesian tree showed the first novel Wuhan-Hu-1 clustered with the

113

first two coronavirus cases reported from Kerala (figure 1a). The phylogenetic tree showed a

114

recent divergence of SARS-CoV-2 from bat SARSr-CoV (divergence time -26.62; 95% CI-

115

24.96-28.33) and Network analysis grouped 24 haplotypes into three major clusters- A, B and C

116

(figure 1b). The cluster A represented by six haplotypes, assigned with three reference genomes

117

of Italy (H_26 to H_28) and cluster B represented by 14 haplotypes assigned with the reference

118

genome of Iran (H_29). Further, the cluster C which represented by only the two haplotypes,

119

H_9 (EPI ISL 413522) and H_10 (EPI ISL 413523), directly linked with the Wuhan-Hu-1,

120

(H_1). Thus, early cases reported from India were genetically assigned in accordance to the

121

patient travel history from Italy, Iran and China (figure 1 a &b). The H_9 was the first

122

coronavirus case reported in India from Thrissur, Kerala and the patient travelled to Kochi, from

123

Kunming via Calcutta on January 24th, and diagnosed positive for SARS-Cov-2 on January 30th

124

2020 [12]. The H_10 was the third case of Coronavirus in India, with similar travel history [12].

125

On diagnosis these cases, about 3,400 suspects came in contact with them were put in quarantine

126

to contain the outbreak, however, no further track records available that, how many of them

127

developed coronavirus at later stages. Interestingly, H_12 which had travel history from Iran,

128

genetically assigned with the cluster A, also indicating forward introduction of virus from Italy

129

to Iran. The network tree being monophyletic in nature provides pragmatic evidences to

130

demonstrate that Wuhan, China has been the first source of silent contriver of SARS-Cov-2 to

131

India and thereafter multiple invasion of SARS-CoV-2 occurred in India from Italy, Iran and

132

possibly from many other countries.

133

Demography of SARS-CoV-2 in India

134

We obtained a multimodal pattern of mismatch distribution curve, supporting SARS-CoV-2 is

135

under demographic equilibrium after following a recent expansion (figure 2b). The estimate of

136

Tajima’s D was significant (-1.55132; P <0.5), and also suggested that the population has

137

experienced a recent expansion. The multimodal curve of the mismatch distribution of pairwise

138

genetic differences did not fit a model of sudden expansion in effective population size (SSD

139

0.02728, P= 0.270). Further multimodal mismatch distribution with a non-significant raggedness

140

index (Rg 0.02728, P= 0.560), suggested population has maintained a relatively long-term

141

demographic stability after the expansion events (table S2). The BSP revealed a rapid expansion

142

in the effective population size during the last 0.10 to 0.25 year which however became stable

143

and showed a present steady growth (figure 2a).

144

Mutation in Spike protein and dN/dS ratio in Structural protein

145

We found seven unique non-synonymous mutations in the Spike protein to form three clusters,

146

coinciding with Network findings. The cluster A showed a common mutation, D614G

147

(23403A>G) present in all sequences. While, only one genome, EPI_ISL_421671 of cluster B

148

showed a non-synonymous mutation, V622I (23426G>A) in the Spike protein. The cluster C

149

revealed two unique non-synonymous mutations (table S3).

150

Comparative analysis of dN/dS ratio showed that MERS-CoV was the most diverged and

151

Bat SARSr-CoV was the closest relative to SARS-CoV-2 (table S4). Further, the dN /dS ratio of

152

the envelop (0.318), membrane (0.01) and nucleocapsid (0.198) genes of SARS-CoV-2 with

153

other coronavirus suggested that the changes in the protein sequences was responsible to drive

154

purifying selection [26]. The dN/dS ratio of the Spike gene was the largest (0.663), signifying

155

this region to be under adaptive selection and plausibly helping virus in transmission

156

(supplementary table S4). Interestingly, the dN/dS ratio from a set of conspecific sequences of a

157

single population, may not essentially be greater than one as synonymous mutation often

158

eliminate deleterious mutation to fix the adaptive selection [27]. The mutation of D614G

159

(23403A>G) observed in Spike protein of genomes with travel history to Italy was also reported

160

as a prevalent mutation in the viral isolates from Europe [28], corroborating the source

161

assignment.

162

We demonstrated, by analyzing 35 high quality genomes that early introduction of the

163

virus in India and its spread was through the cases having travel history from Italy, Iran and

164

China by corroborating the case history, phylogeny and network analysis. The study exhibited, a

165

present steady growth of the virus in India, which indicates virus is still operating and several

166

new corona cases may appear in the near future. Till 26th April 2020, 08:00 GMT+5:30, 26495

167

coronavirus cases were reported from India and unfortunately only 35 complete genomes of the

168

total database of 12,268 virus sequences were available from India on the growing GISAID

169

database. We plead authorities to kindly issue permits and grant funds to the research institutes/

170

labs and appeal scientists to populate more genomes of SARS-CoV-2 of the country in the public

171

database. This will provide scientific fraternity a common platform to analyze, collaborate and

172

understand genetic evolution of the virus to emerge into new structural mutants, transmission

173

rate as well as in-time development of diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines and antivirals.
