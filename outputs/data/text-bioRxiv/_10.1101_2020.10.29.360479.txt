INTRODUCTION

Dysfunctional immune response in the COVID-19 patients is a recurrent theme impacting
symptoms and mortality, yet the detailed understanding of pertinent immune cells is not
complete. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing to 284 samples from 205 COVID-19
patients and controls to create a comprehensive immune landscape. Lymphopenia and
active T and B cell responses were found to coexist and associated with age, sex and their
interactions with COVID-19. Diverse epithelial and immune cell types were observed to be
virus-positive and showed dramatic transcriptomic changes. Elevation of ANXA1 and
S100A9 in virus-positive squamous epithelial cells may enable the initiation of neutrophil
and macrophage responses via the ANXA1-FPR1 and S100A8/9-TLR4 axes. Systemic upregulation of S100A8/A9, mainly by megakaryocytes and monocytes in the peripheral blood,
may contribute to the cytokine storms frequently observed in severe patients. Our data
provide a rich resource for understanding the pathogenesis and designing effective
therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing pandemic infectious disease,
caused with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Currently,
it has caused with around 29 million infections and close to 1 million deaths according to
the statistics of World Health Organization until September 15, 2020, with the fatality rate as
high as ~10% in specific regions. Although many COVID-19 patients experience
asymptomatic, mild or moderate symptoms, some patients progress to severe conditions
and even death. It is thus of paramount importance to understand the disease mechanisms

and the underlying factors associated with vulnerabilities, which are critical for controlling
the pandemic and alleviating the global crisis. It is also critical to systematically investigate
differences between clinical presentations (mild/moderate and severe), or between
treatment outcomes (disease progression and convalescence) of patients, as they can
provide important guidance to the development of effective therapeutics and vaccines.

Integrated analysis of the COVID-19 scRNA-seq data

Multiple studies have suggested the alterations of immune responses as one of the key
mechanisms for severe symptoms (Guo et al., 2020a; Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020;
Silvin et al., 2020a; Wen et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020a; Zhang et al., 2020b). Patients
with severe COVID-19 might have a cytokine storm syndrome accompanying the hyperinflammatory response, which is a major cause of disease severity and death (Cao, 2020;
Del Valle et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020; Liao et al., 2020; Mehta et al., 2020; Zhou et al.,
2020a). During the inflammatory responding process, pathogenic T cells and inflammatory
monocytes produced inflammatory cytokines (Zhou et al., 2020b) such as G-CSF (CostelaRuiz et al., 2020; Du et al., 2020), TNF-α (Jamilloux et al., 2020; Vabret et al., 2020), IL-6
and IL-1 (Abbasifard and Khorramdelazad, 2020; Costela-Ruiz et al., 2020; Del Valle et al.,
2020; Liao et al., 2020; Mehta et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020), and drove downstream
hyper-inflammation. In contrast, some studies have argued against the presence of
cytokine storms (Kox et al., 2020; Wilk et al., 2020). Thus, the detailed immune responses
in COVID-19 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection need to be more thoroughly investigated.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is powerful at dissecting the immune responses
under various conditions at the finest resolution, and has been applied to COVID-19 studies
on limited scales (Chua et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2020a; He et al., 2020; Liao et al., 2020;
Wilk et al., 2020; Xie et al., 2020). While the current single cell studies of COVID-19 have
provided certain details of the cellular and molecular changes of patients after SARS-CoV-2
infection and even during convalescence (Mathew et al., 2020a), the small sample sizes of
such studies have raised concerns over the robustness and the generalization of such
findings. Here we applied scRNA-seq to a large cohort with 205 individuals, including
hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate or severe disease, and patients in the
convalescent stage, as well as healthy controls. With high-quality transcriptomics data of
~1.5 million single cells, we reveal that SARS-CoV-2 could infect a wider range of cell types
than previous understanding, and induce distinct phenotypic changes in those infected cells.
Such heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 infection has important immunological implications as
such cells exhibit distinct interaction potentials with innate and adaptive immune cells. We
also observed critical changes in the peripheral blood discriminating mild/moderate from
severe COVID-19 patients in the disease progression or convalescence stages, and found
their association with patient sex and age. Further, our large cohort analysis provides a
unique opportunity to reveal the characteristics of cytokine storms in patients, and to further
illustrate the cell subpopulations that might contribute to the inflammatory responses and
the hyper-inflammatory genomic signatures under SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings may
have important implications to the research, treatment, control and prevention of COVID-19.

To systematically characterize the immune properties at single-cell resolution in the COVID19 patients, we formed a Single Cell Consortium for COVID-19 in China (SC4), which
consisted of researchers from 36 research institutes or hospitals from different regions of
China. Members of SC4 contributed COVID-19 related scRNA-seq data, mostly still

unpublished, for a total of 205 individuals, including 25 patients with mild/moderate
symptoms, 63 hospitalized patients with severe symptoms, and 92 recovered convalescent
persons, as well as 25 healthy controls (Figure 1A and Table S1). While most previous
studies did not discriminate whether convalescent individuals recovered from mild/moderate
or severe symptoms, we divided the convalescent group into two subgroups, 54 recovered
from mild/moderate symptoms and 38 recovered from severe symptoms, to investigate the
effects of disease severity on the immune status of recovered individuals. This cohort
covered a wide age range (from 6 to 92 years old), with the mild/moderate and severe
groups having significant age differences (Figure S1A), consistent with the epidemiological
observations that aged patients are prone to severe symptoms (Guo et al., 2020a; Hadjadj
et al., 2020; Silvin et al., 2020b; Wilk et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020). Additionally, no
significant difference was noted in the sex composition between the mild/moderate and
severe groups (Figure S1B).
A total of 284 samples were collected for scRNA-seq, of which 249 were from peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and 35 from the respiratory system, which was further
composed of 12 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples, 22 sputum samples, and 1
sample for pleural fluid mononuclear cells. Some patients had multiple samples collected,
including seven patients with matching BALF and PBMC. Most samples were subjected to
scRNA-seq based on the 10X Genomics 5’ sequencing platform to generate both the gene
expression and T cell receptor (TCR) or B cell receptor (BCR) data. The scRNA-seq raw
data were analyzed by a unified analysis pipeline, including the kallisto and bustools
programs (Bray et al., 2016; Melsted et al., 2019), to obtain the gene expression data of
individual cells and by the CellRanger program to obtain TCR and BCR sequences.
We applied a common set of stringent quality control criteria to ensure that the selected
data were from single and live cells and that their transcriptomic phenotypes were
comprehensively characterized. A total of 1,462,702 high-quality single cells were ultimately
obtained, with an average of 4,835 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), representing 1,587
genes (Figures S1D and S1E). With the large-scale of data, we obtained 64 cell clusters,
covering diverse epithelial cells in the respiratory system, megakaryocytes, mast cells,
myeloid cells, and NK/T/B cells (Figure 1B). Such an information-rich resource (available at
http://covid19.cancer-pku.cn/ for quick browsing) enabled accurate annotation and analysis
of these cell clusters at different resolutions (Figure 1C, Figure S1F-J and Table S2), which
allow the elucidation of potential molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the
pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and differences of human immune responses for
patients with distinct symptoms.
Notable differences could be observed in the immune compositions of healthy controls and
COVID-19 patients with mild/moderate or severe symptoms (Figure 1D) or between the
disease progression stages and convalescence (Figure 1E) based on the t-distributed
stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) projection. The tissue preference of each cluster
was illustrated based on the ratio of observed to randomly expected cell numbers (Ro/e,
Figure 1F), partially reflecting the validity of cell clustering. Notably, various clusters of
proliferating CD8+ and CD4+ T, and plasma B cells were more enriched in BALF than
PBMCs, indicating activated adaptive immune responses in the lung (Figure 1F).
We first analyzed the compositional changes of the broad categories of immune cells for
PBMCs in different COVID-19 patient groups. Notably, the percentages of megakaryocytes
and monocytes in PBMCs were elevated, particularly in severe COVID-19 patients during

the disease progression stage (Figure 2A) (Guo et al., 2020a; Zhang et al., 2020b). While
NK cells did not show significant changes among the different patient groups (Figure 2A), B
cells were significantly increased in severe COVID-19 patients (Figure 2A)(Guo et al.,
2020a; Mathew et al., 2020b; Zhang et al., 2020b). By contrast, T cells and DCs were
decreased in severe COVID-19 patients (Figure 2A). These findings are consistent with
previous reports that lymphopenia is frequently observed in COVID-19 patients and that
impaired adaptive immunity may occur (Gao et al., 2020; Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al.,
2020; Kuri-Cervantes et al., 2020; Ni et al., 2020a; Yu et al., 2020).

Elevated plasma B cells in COVID-19 patients
As single-cell dissection can provide the finest resolution to investigate the compositional
changes among different COVID-19 patient groups, we then examined the heterogeneity of
sub-clusters within each major immune cell type. For B cells, XBP1+ plasma cells (B_c05MZB1-XBP1) showed the most significant compositional increases in PBMCs. For some
severe COVID-19 patients, the percentage of plasma cells could even reach 15% of CD45+
cells in PBMCs, but the levels in other COVID-19 patients and healthy controls were less
than 3% (Figure 2B). These cells highly expressed the genes encoding the constant
regions of IgA1, IgA2, IgG1 or IgG2 (Figure 2B), indicating their functions to secrete
antigen-specific antibodies to combat viral infection. This observation is consistent with the
recent report that the serum of severe COVID-19 patients had high titers of SARS-CoV-2specific antibodies (Tan et al., 2020b; Zhang et al., 2020c).
The increased plasma B cells in peripheral blood appeared to be derived from active
proliferation of plasmablasts and transitions from memory B cells based on the paired BCR
sequencing analyses. Both the extent of BCR clonal expansion and the diversity of the total
BCR repertoire of these cells were significantly increased in severe COVID-19 patients
(Figure 2C). Plasmablast cells (B_c06_MKI67), characterized by high expression of MKI67
and thus indicating a proliferative state, were elevated in the peripheral blood of severe
COVID-19 patients (Figure S2A) and shared the most clonotypes with plasma cells (Figure
2D). The memory B cell cluster expressing high levels of CD27, CD80, AIM2, GRIP2, and
COCH (B_c03-CD27-AIM2) was the second major source of plasma B cells in the
peripheral blood, which shared a large proportion of clonotypes with plasma cells and
plasmablasts (Figure 2D). Distinct from plasma cells and plasmablasts which were mainly
composed of IgAs and IgGs, B_c03-CD27-AIM2 had a higher proportion of IgMs (Figure
2E), indicating a precursor state.
We applied analysis of variance (ANOVA) to dissect the associations of compositional
changes of plasma B cells with disease severity, stage (progression or convalescence), age,
sex, or the interactions of these factors. We found that plasma B cells in blood were
specifically associated with the disease severity of COVID-19, and then disease stage, but
had no associations with age or sex observed (Figure 2F) (Takahashi et al., 2020). In fact,
for the mild/moderate disease, convalescent patients harbored higher levels of plasma B
cells than those in the disease progression stage. By contrast, the plasma B cell levels in
convalescent patients who recovered from severe disease were significantly lower than
those in the disease progression stage (Figure 2B). Interestingly, the precursors of plasma
B cells, i.e., cells of B_c03-CD27-AIM2, appeared to be associated with sex differences
(Figure 2G). In females, the percentage of B_c03-CD27-AIM2 cells was significantly higher
than that of males (Figure 2G). Almost all B cell clusters were associated with disease
stages, implying the importance of humoral immune response changes between disease
progression and convalescence (Figure S2B and Table S3).

In summary, plasma B cells appeared to be significantly elevated in the peripheral blood
regarding either the composition, proliferation, or developmental transition from memory B
cells, and were more associated with disease severity. While their precursor cells were also
elevated, they were more prone to be influenced by sex differences, providing a plausible
explanation for the epidemiological observations on sex differences of COVID-19. Taken
together with the observation that plasma B cells were more enriched in BALF (Figure 1F),
these observations may suggest that humoral immune responses were actively initiated to
combat SARS-CoV-2 infection and contributed to disease severity.

Elevated proliferative T cells in COVID-19 patients
Similar to plasma B cells, proliferative CD8+ and CD4+ T cell clusters also showed an
enrichment in BALF (Figure 1F) and elevation in PBMCs of COVID-19 patients albeit with a
decrease of total T cells (Figures 2A and 3A) (Liao et al., 2020). A total of three proliferative
CD8+ T cell clusters identified in this study, including T_CD8_c10-MKI67-GZMK,
T_CD8_c11-MKI67-FOS, and T_CD8_c12-MKI67-TYROBP, were all increased in COVID19 patients but with different characteristics. T_CD8_c10-MKI67-GZMK, a proliferative
effector memory CD8+ T cell group characterized by high expression of STMN1, HMGB2,
MKI67, and GZMK, was increased in the convalescent stage of severe COVID-19 patients
(Figure 3B). Similarly, T_CD8_c11-MKI67-FOS also highly expressed STMN1, HMGB2,
and MKI67, but exhibited low levels of GZMK instead and high levels of FOS. This cluster
was increased in the disease progression stage of severe patients but not in convalescence
(Figure 3B). T_CD8_c12-MKI67-TYROBP was characterized by high expression of STMN1,
HMGB2, MKI67, and a NK cell marker gene TYROBP. This cluster was specifically
increased in mild/moderate patients during the disease progression stage but deceased in
the convalescence to a normal level as in healthy controls (Figure 3B). These observations
were consistent with the activation of T cell responses in the peripheral blood of COVID-19
patients as previously reported using flow cytometry or CyTOF techniques (Mathew et al.,
2020a; Sekine et al., 2020). However, the variations of proliferative CD8+ T cell clusters in
different severity and stages have not been noticed before, which may indicate the
complexity of T cell responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in different patients.
Moreover, in contrast to plasma B cells that accounted for 6.39% of total B cells, each
proliferative CD8+ T cell cluster accounted for a much smaller proportion of the total CD8+
T cells (<1.63%) (Guo et al., 2020a; Liao et al., 2020; Mathew et al., 2020a).
Two proliferative CD4+ T cell clusters were also identified, with T_CD4_c13-MKI67CCL5lowcharacterized by high expression of SELL and low CCL5 and T_CD4_c14-MKI67CCL5high characterized by low SELL and high CCL5. The counts of T_CD4_c14-MKI67CCL5high in PBMCs did not show significant differences among different COVID-19 patients.
By contrast, the T_CD4_c13-MKI67-CCL5low counts were elevated in COVID-19 patients,
particularly in severe patients during the disease progression stage (Figure 3C). Similar to
plasma B cells, the diversity and clonality of this cluster were both increased in severe
patients with disease progression (Figure 3D), indicating an expanded TCR repertoire and
developmental transitions from other clusters. Unlike plasma B cells whose source cluster
B_c03-CD27-AIM2 was increased in peripheral blood (Figure S2C), the major source
cluster of proliferative CD4+ T cells T_c04_CD4−ANXA2 was decreased in COVID-19
patients, particularly in severe patients during the disease progression stage (Figures 3E
and 3F). This may partially explain the dichotomous and incomplete adaptive immunity
previously observed in COVID-19 patients (Catanzaro et al., 2020). ANOVA analyses
revealed that different from T_CD4_c13-MKI67-CCL5low (Figure 3G), the percentage of

T_CD4_c04−ANXA2 was associated with disease severity, progression/convalescence,
and sex (Figure 3H). In particular, female patients generally had higher levels of
T_CD4_c04−ANXA2 than males (Figure 3H), indicating the sex differences of T cell
responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Takahashi et al., 2020).
In contrast to proliferative T cells that were elevated in PBMCs, other T cell clusters showed
decrease in COVID-19 patients albeit with varied magnitudes, consistent with the
lymphopenia that has been frequently observed in COVID-19 patients (GiamarellosBourboulis et al., 2020; Kuri-Cervantes et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020). The most significantly
decreased T cell clusters included γδT cells (T_c14_gdT-TRDV2), MAIT cells (T_CD8_c09SLC4A10), a CD8+ T cell cluster highly expressing TYROBP, KLRF1, CD247 and IL2RB
(T_CD8_c08-IL2RB), and three CD4+ T cell clusters showing effector memory
characteristics (T_CD4_c09-GZMK-FOSlow, T_CD4_c11-GNLY, and T_CD4_c04-ANXA2).
ANOVA analysis suggested that these clusters were mainly associated with disease
severity rather than age or sex (Figures S2D and S2E and Table S3), implicating their
critical roles in the disease progression of COVID-19. In particular, decreases of γδT cells
and MAIT cells in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients (Figures S2F and Figure S2G)
have been supported by flow cytometry-based analyses, suggesting their potent
antimicrobial functions (Jouan et al., 2020).
While the decrease of γδT cells, MAIT cells, and effector memory T cells abovementioned
were primarily associated with disease severity, the decreases of naive and central memory
T cells were associated with the age but not sex difference of patients (Figure S2D and S2E
and Table S3). Such clusters included the naive CD8+ cluster T_CD8_c01-LEF1, the CD8+
central memory cluster T_CD8_c02-GPR183, the naive CD4+ cluster T_CD4_c01-LEF1,
and two CD69+ CD4+ clusters T_CD4_c06-NR4A2 and T_CD4_c05-FOS.
In summary, our scRNA-seq study recapitulated the lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients
frequently observed in previous studies (Dhama et al., 2020; Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al.,
2020; Kuri-Cervantes et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2020a; Yan et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020). We
further confirmed the activation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in PBMCs
recently found by flow cytometry-based immune profiling (Mathew et al., 2020a; Sekine et
al., 2020). With the high resolution provided by scRNA-seq, we revealed the existence of
distinct proliferative T cell clusters for both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in COVID-19 patients,
and implicated their different roles in patients of different groups and stages. Our large
cohort also enabled us to dissect the impact of age and sex on the immune responses of
COVID-19 patients. We found that, rather than associated with T cell proliferation, age and
sex are more likely associated with the abundance of naive/central memory T cells and the
precursor cells of proliferative T cells, respectively, highlighting the complexity of human T
cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

TCR/BCR usage patterns by COVID-19 patients
Our scRNA-seq data also coupled with TCR/BCR repertoire sequencing and thus provided
a rich resource to investigate the TCR/BCR usage of COVID-19 patients, which is
instructive for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics and vaccines. We first
examined whether identical TCRs or BCRs could be identified across COVID-19 patients.
We found that only a few TCRs or BCRs were shared between two patients, and no
identical TCRs or BCRs were shared beyond three patients. No TCRs or BCRs had
identical amino acid sequences in more than three patients for the complementarity
determining regions 3 (CDR3s) of chains of TCRs or heavy chains of BCRs. We further

examined whether the amino acid sequences of CDR3s of published SARS-CoV-2-reacting
antibodies could be identified in the BCR repertoire of this cohort. We found that only one
non-clonal BCR had identical CDR3 in its heavy chain with a comprehensive compendium
containing 1,505 SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies (Cao et al., 2020). Such scarcity of
common TCRs or BCRs was in contrast with previous studies on severe patients recovered
from enterovirus A71 infection and influenza vaccination (Chen et al., 2017; Jiang et al.,
2013), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection might not impose dramatic selective pressure
on the somatic evolution of TCRs and BCRs.
Although no identical BCRs were found, we noticed that the BCR repertoire of COVID-19
patients had biased VDJ usage compared with that of healthy controls. We trained a
random forest classifier with the VDJ usage frequencies to discriminate COVID-19 patients
with mild/moderate or severe symptoms from healthy controls and found that the
classification accuracy measured by the values of area under curve (AUC) could reach as
high as 0.85. The most important VDJ combinations selected by the random forest
classifiers also had significant overlaps with those of experimentally verified SARS-CoV-2reacting antibodies (Figure S2H). Among the top 20 VDJ combinations important to
discriminate severe COVID-19 patients from healthy controls selected by random forests,
14 had identical VDJ usage with experimentally verified neutralizing antibodies. Of note, the
VDJ usage of the currently known SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies was biased towards
IGHV3 and IGHV1. In particular, more than 40 neutralizing antibodies used IGHV3−53.
Such observations are important to the development of effective diagnostics to trace human
infection history and the further refinement of the current neutralizing antibodies.
The diversity of TCR or BCR repertoires of various T and B clusters might also be
influenced by age, sex, COVID-19 severity, and disease stages. While age was mainly
associated with the abundance of only naive and central memory T cells in PBMC, ANOVA
analysis revealed that age might influence the decrease of TCR diversity in a wider range of
T cells, including naive, central memory, and diverse effector memory T cells (Figure S2I-J).
By contrast, sex differences were mainly associated with the BCR diversity of naive and
memory B cells (B_c01-TCL1A, B_c02-MS4A1-CD27, and B_c04-SOX5-TNFRSF1B) and
the TCR diversity of a subset of effector memory CD4+ T cells (T_CD4_c08-GZMK-FOShigh)
(Figure S2I-K). After correcting the effects of age and sex, the decrease of diversity in MAIT
cells, naive B and CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, effector memory CD8+ T cells (T_CD8_c03GZMK and T_CD8_c04-COTL1), and a few CD69+ CD4+ T cell clusters (T_CD4_c03ITGA4, T_CD4_c04-ANXA2) remained independently associated with COVID-19 severity
(Figure S2I-K), highlighting the importance of these cells in COVID-19. Importantly, the
TCR diversity of one proliferative CD8+ T cell cluster, i.e., T_CD8_c11-MKI67-FOS, was
associated with the triad interaction by disease severity, age, and sex (Figure S2J),
indicating the impacts of age and sex on disease severity. Similarly, the clonal expansion of
a central memory CD4+ T cell cluster highly expressing AQP3 (T_CD4_c02-AQP3) was
also associated with the triad interaction by disease severity, age, and sex (Table S3),
indicating that age and sex might impact the COVID-19 disease via multiple mechanisms.
Taken together, our data suggested that SARS-CoV-2 might not impose dramatic selective
pressure on the somatic evolution of TCRs or BCRs for COVID-19 patients, thus resulting
in few identical TCRs and BCRs across patients. However, preferential VDJ usage were
identified, which highly overlapped with the sequences of some known SARS-CoV-2neutralizing antibodies. The diversity of TCR and BCR repertoires of various T and B
clusters might be shaped by age, sex, disease severity, and stages together, although the

influences of these factors were heterogeneous on different cell types. In particular, triad
interactions among age, sex and disease severity were indicated for specific CD8+ and
CD4+ clusters, underscoring the complex T cell responses of COVID-19 patients and
providing important clues for future studies.

SARS-CoV-2 detected in multiple epithelial and immune cell types with
interferon response phenotypes
The enrichment of plasma B and proliferative T cells in BALF and the elevation of these
cells in PBMCs of COVID-19 patients highlighted the roles of these cells in combating
SARS-CoV-2 infection. To explore potential interactions between these cells and SARSCoV-2 infected cells, we examined the characteristics of cell types that harbored SARSCoV-2 sequences in our dataset. From the BALF samples of severe COVID-19 patients in
the disease progression stage, we identified viral RNAs of SARS-CoV-2 in three epithelial
cell types including ciliated, secretory, and squamous epithelial cells and a diverse set of
immune cells including neutrophils, macrophages, plasma B cells, T cells, and NK cells
(Figure 4A). The cell identities of these SARS-CoV-2-positive cells were well confirmed by
their corresponding molecular markers (Figure 4B), excluding the possibility of artefacts
caused by doublets during scRNA-seq. Because ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have been
recognized to play critical roles in mediating viral entry into the host cells for SARS-CoV-2,
we examined their expression levels in these cells (Figure 4C) (Netea et al., 2020). We
found that at least a subset of those epithelial cells expressed ACE2 and TMPRSS2,
consistent with the notion that SARS-CoV-2 employs ACE2 and TMPRSS2 to invade these
cells. Interestingly, those immune cells, which did not express ACE2 or TMPRSS2,
harbored even more viral RNA sequences than the epithelial cells (Figure 4D). The high
viral load reassured that the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in these immune cells was
unlikely caused by experimental contamination. Consistently, an independent scRNA-seq
study of COVID-19 patients also identified SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in neutrophils and
macrophages from the respiratory samples of COVID-19 patients (Bost et al., 2020).
Since interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are typically activated in virus-infected cells
(Schoggins and Rice, 2011), we next examined the expression of ISGs in these cells
(Figure 4E and Table S4). Because IFIT1/2/3 and IFITM1/2/3 are frequently observed to
increase after various viral infections (Zhang et al., 2016), the high expression of these
genes in these immune cells, particularly neutrophils and macrophages, may indicate ISG
activation in these cells. Compared with matched cell types in PBMC, almost all these ISG
genes exhibited elevated expression in these virus+ immune cells (Figures 4F and S3B and
Table S5). Compared with virus-negative immune cells of the same types in the BALF,
SARS-CoV-2+ epithelial cells, including ciliated, secretory, and squamous cells, as well as
those virus-positive neutrophils, exhibited higher levels of ISG expression (Figure 4F and
Table S5). Positive correlations between the viral loads estimated by the abundance of viral
RNAs and the ISG expression levels were observed for squamous epithelial cells but not
ciliated or secretory epithelial cells (Figures 4G and S3C). For immune cells, virus-positive
neutrophils exclusively demonstrated positive correlations between viral loads and ISG
levels (Figure 4G), but this phenomenon did not exist in other immune cell types. These
observations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might be able to infect human cells beyond
traditionally assumed respiratory epithelial cells and could induce interferon responses.
In BALF from mild/moderate COVID-19 patients, fewer cells were obtained and no SARSCoV-2 RNAs were detected in cells from such samples, suggesting that the respiratory tract

of mild/moderate patients might be more intact and the viral titer was lower than those from
severe patients. Although type II alveolar (AT2) cells were reported vulnerable to SARSCoV-2 infection (Hou et al., 2020), our study revealed few AT2 cells in the BALF and no
detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in AT2 cells, which is consistent with the previous finding
that lower respiratory tract cells had lower potential to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 than
those from nasal and upper respiratory tract (Hou et al., 2020; Sungnak et al., 2020).

Distinct transcriptomic changes of ciliated, secretory, and squamous
epithelial cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection
SARS-CoV-2 infection in different epithelial cells resulted in not only distinct interferon
responses, but also significant transcriptomic changes. For squamous epithelial cells,
SARS-COV-2+ cells exhibited elevated expression of a diverse set of genes such as NT5E,
CLCA4, and SULT2B1 (Figure 5A). These genes were enriched in pathways such as
“response to virus”, “response to type I interferon” and “response to hypoxia”, consistent
with viral infection and the subsequent respiratory distress, reflecting the host immune
response via type I interferons (Figure 5B). By contrast, the numbers of genes with
significant changes after SARS-CoV-2 infection for ciliated and secretory epithelial cells
were much smaller than squamous cells, and few genes showed consistent changes in all
the three epithelial cell types (Figure 5C).
We next explored the impact of the above transcriptomic changes, especially on their
interaction potentials with immune cells. Annexin A1 (ANXA1), up-regulated in virus+
squamous epithelial cells (Figure 5D), is known to regulate the functions of neutrophils in
inflammation via its interactions with formyl peptide receptors (Sugimoto et al., 2016). This
prompted us to investigate the cellular interaction changes of epithelial cells with each other
and with immune cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on CSOmap that estimates cellcell interactions in three-dimensional space via ligand-receptor (LR) mediated cell selforganization and competition (Ren et al., 2020), we estimated the cellular interaction
potentials in a computationally constructed pseudo-space and found that ciliated, secretory,
and squamous epithelial cells exhibited distinct interaction potentials after SARS-CoV-2
infection.
Ciliated epithelial cells exhibited lower interaction potentials with themselves and other cells
after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and thus would disperse in the outer compartment of the
pseudo-space (Figures 5E, S4A and S4B), consistent with the pathological phenomenon of
epithelial denudation of coronavirus infection in respiratory tract (Lee et al., 2003; Nicholls
et al., 2003). By contrast, squamous epithelial cells significantly enhanced their interacting
potentials with themselves after SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with those squamous
cells with no viral detection (Figure S4C). Such changes were consistent across COVID-19
patients (Figure 5F). Comparison across ciliated, secretory, and squamous epithelial cells
infected by SARS-CoV-2 also highlighted the dispersing tendency of ciliated cells and the
interacting potentials among squamous cells themselves (Figures 5G and 5H).
Such interaction distinctions not only existed among epithelial cells, but also impacted their
interactions with immune cells. Consistent with the dispersing nature of ciliated cells in the
outer compartment of the pseudo-space, no significant interactions were observed between
virus+ ciliated cells and immune cells. By contrast, virus+ secretory epithelial cells showed
significant interactions with neutrophils and macrophages in mild/moderate COVID-19
patients via the SCGB3A1-MARCO axis (Figures S4D and S4E), but such interactions were
subdued in severe COVID-19 patients due to the down-regulation of MARCO in neutrophils

and macrophages (Figure S4F). In severe patients, virus+ squamous cells showed
significant interactions with neutrophils and macrophages via the ANXA1-FPR1 and
S100A9/A8-TLR4 axes (Figure 5I). Neutrophils and macrophages exhibiting high interacting
potentials with virus+ squamous epithelial cells were also prone to be SARS-CoV-2 infected
(Figure 5J). As ANXA1-FPR1 and S100A9/A8-TLR4 interactions have been reported to
play critical roles in the recruitment of immune cells and inflammatory cascade under
various conditions including sepsis and tumor (Gavins et al., 2012; Laouedj et al., 2017;
Osei-Owusu et al., 2019; Vogl et al., 2007), they might also play important roles in the
pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In contrast to innate immune cells such as
neutrophils and macrophages, T and B cells did not show significant interactions with any of
the three types of virus+ epithelial cells (Figure S4G), implying a compromised adaptive
immune response. It is noteworthy that plasma B cells in BALF also tended to be SARSCoV-2-positive and displayed close interactions with virus+ neutrophils and squamous
epithelial cells via the S100A9/A8-TLR4 axes (Figure 5L).
We then investigated the cell types expressing ANXA1, FPR1, S100A9, S100A8, and TLR4
in both BALF and PBMC across COVID-19 patients to evaluate the possible inflammatory
cascade mediated by these LR pairs. It was evident that ANXA1 was highly expressed in a
wide range of immune cells except B cells and naive T cells (Figures S5A and S5B) and its
receptor FPR1 was highly expressed in neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes (Figures
S5A and S5B). Interestingly, for most immune cell clusters in BALF, the expression levels
of ANXA1 and FPR1 were down-regulated in severe COVID-19 patients compared with
those of mild/moderate COVID-19 patients (Figure S5A). But in PBMCs, except for MAIT
cells (T_CD8_c09-SLC4A10) and γδT cells (T_gdT_c14-TRDV2), ANXA1 and FPR1 were
significantly up-regulated in many cell types in severe COVID-19 patients compared with
those of mild/moderate COVID-19 patients (Figure S5B). S100A9 and S100A8 were highly
expressed in neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes in COVID-19 patients with
mild/moderate symptoms and had no expression in T, B, NK, or dendritic cells (Figures
S4H and S5B). However, for severe COVID-19 patients in the disease progression stage,
S100A9 and S100A8 were significantly up-regulated in almost all cell clusters for both
BALF and PBMCs (Figures S4H and S5B). In particular, T, B, NK, and dendritic cells had
no or minimal levels of S100A9 and S100A8 expression in mild/moderate COVID-19
patients (Figures S4H and S5B). By contrast, in severe COVID-19 patients, the levels of
S100A9 and S100A8 were significantly up-regulated in T, B, NK, and dendritic cells
(Figures S4H and S5B), indicating a systemic inflammatory response. TLR4 did not exhibit
significant differences in PBMCs between severe and mild/moderate COVID-19 patients but
was significantly down-regulated in certain BALF monocyte and macrophage subsets
(Figure S5B).
In summary, our data indicated that SARS-CoV-2 infection in different types of epithelial
cells might trigger different transcriptomic changes and thus could modulate their
interactions with themselves and with immune cells. In particular, squamous epithelial cells
could up-regulate ANXA1 and S100A8/A9 after SARS-CoV-2 infection, enhancing their
interactions with neutrophils and macrophages via the axes of ANXA1-FPR1 and
S100A8/A9-TLR4. The systemic up-regulation of ANXA1, FPR1, and S100A8/A9 in
immune cells from peripheral blood may indicate, at least partially, the molecular
mechanism of aberrant inflammation in severe COVID-19 patients. This hypothesis is
supported by a preliminary finding that small molecules targeting S100A8/A9 could inhibit
SARS-CoV-2-induced aberrant inflammation in mice (Guo et al., 2020b). Thus, S100A8/A9
should be further evaluated as therapeutic targets. Compared to innate immune cells,

adoptive immune cells including T and B cells did not show significant interactions with
SARS-CoV-2-positive epithelial cells in BALF by computational simulation, consistent with
previous findings (Chua et al., 2020; Wauters et al., 2020). These might suggest a
compromised adaptive immune response in severe patients. Furthermore, the
megakaryocytes in PBMCs, followed by monocytes, exhibited higher interaction potentials
with epithelial and immune cells in BALF than adaptive immune cells (Figure S4I),
suggesting the critical roles of these cells in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

Each of the hyper-inflammatory subtypes highly expressed several cytokine genes that are
known to be involved in the inflammatory storm, such as CCL3, IL1B, CXCL8, CCL4, CCL6,
IL32, LTB and TGFB1, but with different patterns (Figure 6B), suggesting divergent
genomic signatures of these cells. We then investigated the proportion of each of the 7 cell
subtypes in every patient and found that these hyper-inflammatory cell subtypes were in
general slightly more frequent in patients at severe stage (Figure. S6C). When we clustered
these cell subtypes with each individual patient based on the proportions of the hyperinflammatory cell subtype in PBMCs, we found distinct enrichment of these cell subtypes in
different groups of patients (Figure 6C). Mono_c1-CD14-CCL3, known be associated with
tocilizumab-responding cytokine storm (Guo et al., 2020a), was highly enriched in a
subpopulation of severe onset patients likely to be accompanied by inflammatory storm
(Figures 6C and 6D). The proportion of Mono_c1-CD14-CCL3 subtype was also correlated
with the age of the corresponding patients (Figure. 6E). The hyper-inflammatory
megakaryocytes were enriched in another batch of severe onset patients, which could also
be under excessive inflammatory response (Figure. 6C and 6D).

By contrast, Mono_c2-CD14-HLA-DPB1 and Mono_c3-CD14-VCAN subtypes were widely
distributed in every disease stage, and the hyper-inflammatory T cells showed decreased
proportions in patients at the severe onset stage such as T_CD4_c08-GZMK-FOShigh
subtype (Figures 6C, 6D and S6B), although both of these two monocyte subtypes
exhibited increased proportions in elder convalescent patients (Figure 6E). Taken together,
these results suggest that Mono_c1-CD14-CCL3 and megakaryocytes were the major

Megakaryocytes and monocyte subsets as critical peripheral sources of
cytokine storms
With our large scale scRNA-seq dataset, we next sought to investigate whether any crucial
cell subtypes in peripheral blood contribute to the bulk of inflammatory cytokine production.
We first defined a cytokine score and inflammatory score for each cell based on the
expressions of the collected cytokine genes and reported inflammatory response genes
(Liberzon et al., 2015) (Table S6), respectively, and used these two scores as indicators to
evaluate the levels of inflammatory cytokine storm for each cell. We found apparent
elevated expression of cytokine and inflammatory genes in patients, especially at the
severe progression stage (Figures 6A and S6A), indicating the existence of inflammatory
cytokine storm after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seven cell subtypes, including three subtypes
of monocytes (Mono_c1-CD14-CCL3, Mono_c2-CD14-HLA-DPB1 and Mono_c3-CD14VCAN), three subtypes of T cells (T_CD4_c08-GZMK-FOShigh, T_CD8_c06-TNF and
T_CD8_c09-SLC4A10) and one subtype of megakaryocytes was detected with significantly
higher cytokine and inflammatory scores (Figure. S9B, Table S2, P < 0.0001), indicating
that these cells might be major sources of inflammatory storm. Interestingly,
megakaryocytes, which have not been reported in the inflammatory response in COVID-19
patients, may affect the functions of platelets at the disease stage, in consistent to a
previous study (Manne et al., 2020).

sources triggering cytokine inflammatory storm, with both elevated cell ratios and
inflammatory scores in the severe onset patients. On the other hand, although the severity
of COVID-19 is correlated with lymphopenia, partially reflected by reduced T cells in PBMC
(Dhama et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2020a; Yan et al., 2020), certain T cell subtypes might
actually contribute to the inflammatory storm by enhanced expressing of proinflammatory
cytokines.

Next, we investigated the inflammatory signatures for each hyper-inflammatory cell subtype
and found unique pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expressions in each cell subtype (Figure
6F), suggesting diverse mechanisms by which these cell subtypes may contribute to the
cytokine storm. The hyper-inflammatory Mono_c1-CD14-CCL3 and megakaryocytes largely
expressed more cytokines, suggesting central roles of the two cell types in driving the
inflammatory storm. Specifically, Mono_c1-CD14-CCL3 highly expressed CXCL8, TNF,
IL1RN, IL1B, and CCL3, which we also detected with significantly higher levels in serum
from patients at the severe stage, especially those critically ill patients (Figures 6F and
S6D). Although the inflammatory megakaryocytes highly expressed the cell type identity
marker genes such as PPBP (Zhang et al., 1997), the expression level of these genes was
significantly decreased in patients compared to healthy controls, indicating a loss of
function of these cells after inflammatory activation (Figures 6F and 6G). Notably, the
T_CD8_c06-TNF subtype specifically and highly expressed IFNG, a pro-inflammatory
cytokine highly enriched in patients at the severe onset stage also confirmed by serum
cytokine detection (Figures 6F, G and S6D). Moreover, pro-inflammatory cytokines CXCL8
and IFNG showed significant age-dependent expressions in patients with disease
progression, while no significance was observed in healthy controls (Figure 6H). PPBP
showed no correlation with the age in either patients or healthy controls, suggesting that the
loss of function of megakaryocytes might not be age-dependent (Figure 6H). To assess the
dynamic changes of cytokines in COVID-19 patients with different periods, we compared
them with healthy controls for these seven hyper-inflammatory subtypes, and found that
IFNG, IL6, CCL3, TNF, CXCL2, CXCL8, IL1RN, etc, were highly expressed in cells of
severe patients with disease progression (Figure S6E).

We also observed eight cell subtypes with significantly higher cytokine scores even though
their inflammatory scores showed no difference to other cell clusters (Figure S6B, Table S7,
p < 0.0001). These cell subtypes exhibited uniform and relatively low expressions of
cytokine genes such as IGF1, TXLNA, SCYL1, CCL5 and IL16 (Figure 6F), likely not
involved in the cytokine storm. No significant differences were observed at the serum level
for these cytokines between the different groups of patients (Figure S6F). These genes
specific for hyper-inflammatory cells may serve as signatures for the inflammatory storm
and be helpful in deepening the understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.

Interactions of hyper-inflammatory cell subtypes in lung and peripheral
blood
The dysregulated cytokine responses associated with the inflammatory cytokine storm may
cause immunopathological injury to the lung, and large amount of infiltrating inflammatory
immune cells have been demonstrated in the pulmonary tissue of COVID-19 patient
(Bhaskar et al., 2020; Cao, 2020; Sun et al., 2020). We analyzed the expressions of
cytokines and inflammatory genes for each cell from the BALF samples, and compared the
inflammatory and cytokine scores among all the cell subtypes captured in BALF. No
enrichment of cytokine genes was observed from the epithelial cells, while subtypes of
macrophages and monocytes had the highest cytokine and inflammatory scores in the

severe onset samples (Figure 7A). Similar to our analysis on PBMCs, we identified five
hyper-inflammatory cell subtypes, including Macro_c2-CCL3L1, the three subtypes of
monocytes and the neutrophils (Figure 7B), suggesting that these cell subtypes might be
the major sources driving inflammatory storm in the lung tissue. Neither CD4+ nor CD8+ T
cells were detected with an elevated inflammatory score or the cytokine score in BALF
samples, which was different from those in PBMCs. Each hyper-inflammatory subtype
highly expressed specific cytokines; for example, Macro_c2-CCL3L1 specifically expressed
CCL8, CXCL10/11, and IL6. Mono_c1-CD14-CCL3, as one of the most notable
proinflammatory cell types in both peripheral blood and BALF, uniquely expressed high
expression levels of IL1B, CCL20, CXCL2, CXCL3, CCL3, CCL4, HBEGF and TNF. The
neutrophils also showed many uniquely expressed cytokines including TNFSF13B, CXCL8,
FTH1, CXCL16 (Figure 7C).

To examine how hyper-inflammatory cells interacted with each other in driving the
inflammatory cytokine storm, we analyzed the ligand-receptor pairing patterns among
hyper-inflammatory cell subtypes in severe and moderate samples within PBMC and BALF
respectively (Figure S7). The interactions between PBMCs and BALF cells appeared to
show significant alterations (Figure 7D). Our data revealed elevated ligand-receptor
interactions of hyper-inflammatory cells in patients at severe compared to moderate stage.
Interestingly, cells in the peripheral blood of severe patients showed much lower
interactions with each other compared to those in BALF (Figure. S7A), except for the
megakaryocytes, which secreted IL1B and stimulated Mono_c1-CD14-CCL3 cells.
Mono_c1-CD14-CCL3 cells in BALF expressed CCR5, which could receive multiple
cytokine stimulations secreted by other cell types in both the lung tissue and the peripheral
blood. By contrast, the interactions of Macro_c2-CCL3L1 cells mainly relied on CCR2 and
IL1R2. Collectively, these findings illustrated the molecular basis for the potential cell-cell
interactions at the pulmonary interface in an inflamed state, leading to a better
understanding of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

DISCUSSION
Our SC4 alliance members generated scRNA-seq data for 284 clinical samples from 205
COVID-19 patients and healthy controls in China, and constructed an information-rich data
resource for dissecting the immune responses of COVID-19 patients at the single-cell
resolution. We observed a significant reduction of total T cells in the peripheral blood of
COVID-19 patients but no notable changes of NK cells, consistent with previous
observations (Liao et al., 2020). However, we did not observe a decrease of total B cells,
but instead noted elevation in some patients, particularly those with severe symptoms. This
contradicts previous studies based on flow cytometry (Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020),
which may reflect sampling fluctuation in small cohorts instead of technology bias, although
this has yet to be confirmed. Our findings indicate that T cell changes may be a major
cause of the lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients. Despite the overall reduction of total T
cells in the peripheral blood, proliferative CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were actually elevated in
peripheral blood and were enriched in lung samples, indicating activated cellular immune
responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similarly, despite the conflicting reports on total B cell
levels, plasma B cells were consistently elevated in patient lung samples and blood,
supporting an activated humoral response (Gudbjartsson et al., 2020; Ni et al., 2020b). The
complex patterns of T and B cell subtype changes indicate that additional investigations are
needed to understand the detailed mechanism by which the cellular and humoral immune
responses are activated and compromised in COVID-19 patients.

Previous clinical and epidemiological studies have revealed obvious sex and age biases in
infection rates and disease severity of COVID-19 patients. Our data, covering a wide age
range and a sex-balanced COVID-19 cohort, proved to be powerful at dissecting the
associations of age and sex in the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data
revealed an apparent involvement of age and sex in the diverse human immune responses
via multiple mechanisms, at least partially reflected at the immune cell sub-cluster level. In
general, plasma B and proliferative T cells were associated with disease severity, while
compositional differences of the precursor cells of these adaptive immune cell types were
more prone to be influenced by sex and age seemed to impact more on naive and central
memory cells. Of note, age and sex also seemed to impact the diversity of TCR/BCR
repertoires for a wide range of T and B cells, which may have clinical implications.
The single-cell resolution of our data also enabled us to examine the in vivo potential host
cells of SARS-CoV-2 and the transcriptomic changes caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. We
observed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in multiple epithelial cell types in the human
respiratory tract, including ciliated, secretory, and squamous cells. Although prominent type
I interferon responses could be identified in these cells, distinct transcriptomic changes
appeared to be caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such distinctions were exhibited not only
in the correlations of interferon responses and viral load, but also in the genes of specific
immune relevance, including those encoding LR interactions which are pivotal to cell-cell
communications. Of hundreds of immune-relevant LR pairs, ANXA1-FPR1 and S100A8/A9TLR4 seemed to be critical in mediating the interactions of virus+ squamous epithelial cells
and neutrophils and macrophages. Although S100A8/A9 were not expressed in lymphoid
cells in mild/moderate COVID-19 patients, they were highly expressed in the T, B, and NK
cells of severe patients, likely contributing to the aberrant inflammation of these patients.
Coincidentally, small molecule inhibitors of S100A8/A9 could reduce the aberrant
inflammation and SARA-CoV-2 replication in mice (Guo et al., 2020b), supporting our
findings. Both S100A8/9 and FPR1 should be evaluated further as targets for modulating
the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to epithelial cells, RNAs of SARS-CoV-2 were also identified in various immune
cell types, including neutrophils, macrophages, plasma B cells, T and NK cells, often with
even higher levels than those in epithelial cells. The viral infection status of these cells
could also be supported by the prominent interferon responses in these cells. It is still not
clear how such immune cells would acquire viral sequences in the absence of either ACE2
or TMPRSS2, but it is evident that the pattern of SARS-CoV-2 infection is more complicated
than initial understanding. Such complexity needs to be thoroughly addressed before this
dreadful infectious disease can be effectively controlled.
The rich information of our data also allowed us to dissect the cellular origins of potential
cytokine storms. We found that megakaryocytes and a few monocyte subsets might be key
sources of a diverse set of cytokines highly elevated in COVID-19 patients with severe
disease progression. We suspect that in severe patients, infected epithelial cells would
secrete cytokines such as IL1RN into the peripheral, and monocytes expressing IL1R2
could be stimulated and in turn produce multiple proinflammatory cytokines such as CXCL8,
IL6, IL1B, and TNF (Figure 7E). Through IL1R2, these hyperactive monocytes could also
interact with dysfunctional megakaryocytes producing TGFB1, TNFSF4, PF4 and FTH1.
Meanwhile, the T cells in the blood go through lymphopenia, while the residual ones are
hyperactive in secreting many inflammatory cytokines such as IFNG and TNFSF8. Such
proinflammatory cytokines secreted by the cells in the blood could also infiltrate into the

neutrophils for further cytokine production. We acknowledge that this is only one of many
possible scenarios where an inflammatory storm could form, although our data revealed
key actors in the final cytokine screenplay.

Sample collection
Blood samples that were not immediately processed for cell encapsulation were mixed with
Whole Blood Cell Stabilizer (Cytodelics) and stored at −80 °C freezer. The peripheral blood
mononuclear cell (PBMCs) were isolated using standard density gradient centrifugation and
then used for 10x single-cell RNA-seq. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were
collected from COVID-19 patients and processed with 2h according to WHO guidance.
BALF was passed through 100-μm nylon cell strainer to obtain single cell suspensions with
cooled RPMI 1640 complete medium. Cells in the BALF were freshly used for 10x singlecell RNA-seq. Sputum samples were collected from COVID-19 patients using an
oropharyngeal swab or hypertonic saline induction. To reduce squamous cell contamination,
subjects were asked to rinse their mouth with water and clear their throat. Samples were
incubated in Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline (DPBS) with agitation for 15 minutes
and filtered through 40-micron strainers. Cells in the sputum were freshly used for 10x
single-cell RNA-seq.

Single-cell RNA-seq data processing

Cell suspensions were barcoded through the 10x Chromium Single Cell platform using
Chromium Single Cell 5′ Library, Chromium Single Cell 3′ Library, Gel Bead and Multiplex
Kit, and Chip Kit (10x Genomics). The loaded cell numbers range from 300-500,000 aiming
for 300-14,000 single cells per reaction. Single-cell RNA libraries were prepared using the
Chromium Single Cell 3′ v2 Reagent (10x Genomics; PN-120237, PN-120236 and PN120262), Chromium Single Cell 3′ v3 Reagent (10x Genomics; PN-1000075, PN-1000073
and PN-120262) the Chromium Single Cell 5′ v2 Reagent (10x Genomics, 120237), and
Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Reagent kits (10x Genomics, PN-1000006, PN-1000014, PN1000020, PN-1000005) was used to prepare single-cell RNA libraries according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Each sequencing library was generated with a unique sample
index. The libraries were sequenced using either DIPSEQ, BGISEQ or Illumina platforms.

Single-cell sequencing data were aligned and quantified using kallisto/bustools (KB, v0.24.4)
(Bray et al., 2016) against the GRCh38 human reference genome downloaded from 10x
Genomics official website. Preliminary counts were then used for downstream analysis.

counts, number of detected genes and proportion of mitochondrial gene counts per cell.
Specifically, cells with less than 1000 UMI counts and 500 detected genes were filtered, as
well as cells with more than 10% mitochondrial gene counts. To remove potential doublets,
for PBMC samples, cells with UMI counts above 25,000 and detected genes above 5,000
are filtered out. For other tissues, cells with UMI counts above 70,000 and detected genes
above 7,500 are filtered out. Additionally, we applied Scrublet (Wolock et al., 2019) to
identify potential doublets. The doublet score for each single cell and the threshold based
on the bimodal distribution was calculated using default parameters. The expected doublet
rate was set to be 0.08, and cells predicted to be doublets or with doubletScore larger than
0.25 were filtered. After quality control, a total of 1,598,708 cells were remained. We
normalized the UMI counts with the deconvolution strategy implemented in the R package
scran (Lun et al., 2016). Specifically, cell-specific size factors were computed by
computeSumFactors function and further used to scale the counts for each cell. Then the
logarithmic normalized counts were used for the downstream analysis.

Detection and processing of cells with viral RNA

To integrate cells into a shared space from different datasets for unsupervised clustering,
we used the harmony algorithm (Korsunsky et al., 2019) to do batch effect correction. To
detect the most variable genes used for harmony algorithm, we performed variable gene
selection separately for each sample. A consensus list of 1,500 variable genes was then
formed by selecting the genes with the greatest recovery rates across samples, with ties
broken by random sampling. All ribosomal, mitochondrial and immunoglobulin genes were
then removed from the list. Next, we calculate a PCA matrix with 20 components using
such informative genes and then feed this PCA matrix into HarmonyMatrix() function
implemented in R package Harmony. We set sample and dataset as two technical
covariates for correction with theta set as 2.5 and 1.5, respectively. The resulting batchcorrected matrix was used to build nearest neighbor graph using scanpy (Wolf et al., 2018).
Such nearest neighbor graph was then used to find clusters by Louvain algorithm (Traag et
al., 2019). The cluster-specific marker genes were identified using the rank_genes_groups
function.
The first round of clustering (resolution = 0.3) identified six major cell types including T cells,
NK cells, B cells, plasma B cells, myeloid cells and epithelial cells. To identify clusters
within each major cell type, we performed a second round of clustering on T/NK, B/plasma
B, myeloid and epithelial cells separately. The procedure of the second round of clustering
is the same as first round, starting from low-rank harmony output (30 components) on the
highly variable genes chosen as described above, with resolution ranging from 0.3 to 1.5.
Each sub cluster was restrained to have at least 30 significantly highly expressed genes
(FDR < 0.01, logFC > 0.25, t test) compared with other cells. Annotation of the resulting
clusters to cell types was based on the known markers. Meanwhile, single cells expressing
two sets of well-studied canonical markers of major cell types were labeled as doublets and
excluded from the following analysis. Also, cells highly expressed HBA, HBB and HBD,
which are the markers for erythrocytes, were also excluded. 136,006 cells were removed
and a total of 1,462,702 cells were retained for downstream analysis.

To identify single cells with viral infection, we aligned raw scRNA-seq reads using
kallisto/bustools(KB) against a customized reference genome, in which the SARS-CoV-2
genome (Refseq-ID:NC_045512) was added as an additional chromosome to the human

TCR and BCR analysis

The remaining cells were then used for dimension reduction and unsupervised clustering
using Python package scanpy (Wolf et al., 2018) In brief, the top 500 genes with the highest
variance were selected and the dimensionality of the data was reduced by principal
component analysis (PCA) (30 components) first and then with t-SNE, followed by Louvain
clustering (Traag et al., 2019) performed on the 30 principal components (resolution = 1).
For t-SNE visualization, we directly fit the PCA matrix into the scanpy.api.tl.tsne function
with perplexity of 30. To identify cell-type-specific gene markers, we selected genes that
were differentially expressed across different cell types (FDR < 0.01, log fold change > 0.5)
using the rank_genes_groups function. Clusters were annotated based on the expression
of known marker genes.

TCR/BCR sequences were assembled and quantified following Cell Ranger (v.3.0.2) vdj
protocol against GRCh38 reference genome. Assembled contigs labeled as low-confidence,
non-productive or with UMIs < 2 were discarded.
To identify TCR clonotype for each T cell, only cells with at least one TCR α-chain (TRA)
and one TCR β-chain (TRB) were remained. For a given T cell, if there are two or more α or
β chains assembled, the highest expression level (UMI or reads) α or β chains was
regarded as the dominated α or β chain in the cell. Each unique dominated α-β pair (CDR3
nucleotide sequences and rearranged VDJ genes included) was defined as a clonotype. T
cells with exactly the same clonotype constituted a T cell clone.
BCR clonotypes were identified similar to TCR. Only cells with at least one heavy chain
(IGH) and one light chain (IGL or IGK) were kept. For a given B cell, if there are two or
more IGH or IGL/IGK assembled, the highest expression level (UMI or reads) IGH or
IGL/IGK was defined as the dominated IGH or IGL/IGK in the cell. Each unique dominated
IGH-IGL/IGK pair (CDR3 nucleotide sequences and rearranged VDJ genes) was defined as
a clonotype. B cells with exactly the same clonotype constituted a B cell clone.
220,968 T cells with TCR information and 282,464 B cells with BCR information were used
to perform the STARTRAC analysis as we previously described (Zhang et al.,
2018).STARTRAC-expa was used to quantified the potential clonal expansion level.
TCR/BCR diversity was calculated as Shannon’s entropy shown below:

Comparing immune cell proportion
For samples from PBMC and BALF tissue, we calculated immune cell proportions for each
major cell type and underlying cell subsets. In order to avoid bias caused by samples
dominated by few cell types, we filtered samples containing FACS-sorted B/T cells and
retained those samples with CD45+ cells > 1000. For each sample, cell type proportion was
calculated by number of cells in certain cell type divided by total number of CD45+ cells. To

Inflammatory and cytokine score related subtypes analysis.

To further assess how different patients’ phenotypes and their potential interactions
influence cell type proportions, we performed multivariate ANOVA on cell type proportions
and on diversity of BCR/TCR based on different patient phenotypes, including disease
severity, disease progression stage, sex and age. All interactions between these variables
were included in the models. To convert age into a categorical variable, we binned patient
age into four groups: young (<18 years old), middle-age (18-50 years old), old-age (50-70
years old) and the elderly (70+ years old). Interactions between variables were regarded as
significantly associated with cell type proportions when FDR < 0.05.

To investigate the impact of virus infection on epithelial cells, we identify differential
expressed genes by performing two-sided unpaired Wilcoxon tests on all the expressed
genes (expressed in at least 10% cells in either group of cells). P values were adjusted
following Benjamini & Hochberg protocol. Top 100 highly expressed genes of each group
were shown in the volcano plots. Based on these genes, enriched GO terms were then
acquired for each group of cells using R package clusterProfiler (Yu et al., 2012).

To illustrate the cell-cell interaction potential of cells with viral detection, we first created a
set of datasets by joining 7 BALF samples with the virus+ dataset separately. Then, we
used CSOmap (Ren et al., 2020) to construct a 3D pseudo space and calculate the
significant interaction for each dataset. To investigate the interaction potentials of the cell
types, we used two indexes, distances within cell type and normalized connection. Distance
within each cell type is calculated based on the aforementioned 3D coordinates. The
shorter the distance, the closer the cells are located in the 3D space, which indicates that
they are more likely to interact with each other. To further investigate the interaction
between different cell types, we made use of the CSOmap output connection matrix. For a
cluster pair, normalized connection was calculated by dividing its corresponding connection
value by the product of their respective cell numbers. Normalized connections were then
multiplied by 10,000. Meanwhile, to highlight the key ligand-receptor pairs function in the
interaction, we also examine the contribution output by CSOmap.
In addition, normalized connections were also calculated on another set of cohorts where
we combined virus+ dataset with samples with paired PBMC and BALF tissues, in order to
investigate the interaction potential between cells from two tissues, PBMC and BALF.

Briefly, we firstly filtered out samples with less than 1000 cells. For PBMC, only subtypes
with more than 1000 cells were included in the subsequent analysis. For BALF data
analysis, we removed major cell types with less than 500 cells. To define inflammatory and

collected cytokine genes based on these references (see Table S1). Cytokine and
inflammatory score were evaluated with the AddModuleScore function built in the Seurat
(PMID: 31178118). To select the most promising hyper-inflammatory cell types, we
performed Mann-Whitney rank test (single-tail) for each subtype’s score versus all the other
subtypes' score. Seven subtypes (Mono_c1-CD14-CCL3, Mono_c2-CD14-HLA-DPB1,
Mono_c3-CD14-VCAN, T_CD4_c08-GZMK-FOShigh, T_CD8_c06-TNF, T_CD8_c09SLC4A10 and Mega) in PBMC were defined as hyper-inflammatory cell types with
significantly statistical parameters (P < 0.0001) in both cytokine and inflammatory score. In
addition, we defined 8 subtypes (T_CD8_c08-IL2RB, T_CD4_c11-GNLY, NK_c01-FCGR3A,
T_CD8_c05-ZNF683, T_CD8_c04-COTL1, T_CD8_c07-TYROBP, T_CD8_c03-GZMK and
T_gdT_c14-TRDV2) with significantly statistical parameters (P < 0.0001) only in cytokine
score. For subtypes in BALF, we defined 5 subtypes (Macro_c2-CCL3L1, Mono_c1-CD14CCL3, Mono_c2-CD14-HLA-DPB1, Mono_c3-CD14-VCAN, Neu) as hyper-inflammatory
types with the same standard threshold as PBMC (P < 0.0001).

Cytokine analysis of serum by using multiplex bead-based immunoassay

To explore whether there are state-specific of COVID-19 patients enriched subtypes, we
performed hierarchical clustering with setting standard scale (0-1) for 7 hyper-inflammatory
and 8 cytokine subtypes respectively. Then, we used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to
calculate the significance of cell proportion of each subtype in states (moderate
convalescent, moderate progression, severe convalescent, severe progression) compared
with healthy control. We also applied the ordinary least square method to calculate the
correlation between age and cell proportion in different states of COVID-19 patients. For the
significance of cytokine expression level with state and age, we performed Wilcoxon ranksum test and ordinary least square to assess the P values.

To identify and visualize the possible cell-cell interactions in terms of cytokine storm
between the highly inflammation-correlated cell types evaluated by the inflammation score
within each tissue and the crosstalk between lung and circulating blood, we employed an R
package iTALK introduced by Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2019, bioRxiv,
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/507871v1). Cytokine/chemokine category (n = 320)
in the ligand-receptor database was selectively used for our purpose. Wilcoxon rank sum
test was used to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between severe onset
and moderate onset patient groups for each cell type. DEGs were then matched and paired
against the ligand-receptor database to construct a putative cell-cell communication
network. An interaction score defined as the product of the log fold change of ligand and
receptor was used to rank these interactions. In addition, the expression level of both ligand
and receptor were also considered. We defined severe gained interaction if a ligand gene
was upregulated in severe onset group and its paired gene upregulated or remains no
change. We defined severe lost interaction if a ligand(receptor) gene was downregulated in
severe onset group regardless of the expression level of its paired gene.

Figure 1. Single-cell atlas of multiple tissue types from healthy individuals and
COVID-19 patients

Sample preparation
Whole blood from COVID-19 patients and healthy controls were drawn into collection tubes
containing anticoagulant. Centrifugation the tubes at 1,000 x g for 15 min at 4°C and
transfer the serum to a clean polyprophylene tube, followed by another centrifugation at
10,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C to completely remove platelets and precipitates. Dilute
samples fourfold (1:4) by adding 1 volume of sample to 3 volumes of Bio-Plex sample
diluent. Fifty microliter of each sample were used to assay.
Preparation of oupled beads
Coupled beads were diluted to a 1x concentration according to the instruction. Required
volume of Bio-Plex assay buffer was added to a 15 ml polypropylene tube. Vortex the stock
coupled beads at medium speed for 30 sec. Carefully open the cap and pipet any liquid
trapped in the cap back into the tube. Dilute coupled beads to 1x by pipetting the required
volume into the 15 ml tube and vortex. Protect the beads from light with aluminum foil and
equilibrate to room temperature prior to use.
Assay running
Add coupled beads, standards and samples to each well of the assay plate. Cover plate
with a new sheet of sealing tape and protect from light with aluminum foil. Incubate on
shaker at 850 50 rpm at room temperature (RT). While the samples were incubating,
calculate and prepare the volume of detection antibodies and detection antibody diluent
needed. After washing the plate three times with 100 µl wash buffer, transfer 25 µl detection
antibodies to each well using a multichannel pipet. Cover plate with a new sheet of sealing
tape and protect from light with aluminum foil. Incubate on shaker at 850
50 rpm for 30
min at room temperature.

(A) Dot plots showing the expression of ANXA1 (top), FPR1 (middle) and TLR4 (bottom) in
PBMC samples.
(B) Dot plots showing the expression of ANXA1 (first panel), FPR1 (second panel) S100A9
(third panel), S100A8 (fourth panel) and TLR4 (bottom panel) in BALF samples.
Each dot is colored by the means of the expression and sized by the scaled means (Z
scores).

(A) t-SNE plots of PBMC cells colored by cytokine score (top panel) and inflammatory score
(bottom panel).
(B) The proportion of subtypes from healthy controls (color, n=20), severe onset (color,
n=38) and average of all samples (n=159) (top panel); the inflammatory score (middle panel)
and cytokine score (bottom panel) of subtypes from healthy controls (n=20), moderate
convalescent (n=48), moderate onset (n=18), severe convalescent (n=35) and severe onset
(n=38) patients. Significance was evaluated with Mann-Whitney rank test for each subtype
versus all the other subtypes. **** P < 0.0001.
(C) Barplots of subtypes’ (seven hyper-inflammatory cell types, eight cytokine cell types and
others) frequencies across each individual samples from healthy controls (n=20), moderate
convalescent (n=48), moderate onset (n=18), severe convalescent (n=35) and severe onset
(n=38) patients.
(D) Bar graphs showing cytokine concentration at the serum levels of CCL3, IFNG, IL1RN
and TNF from healthy controls (n=5), convalescent (n=7), non-severe (n=4), severe (n=4),
death case (n=7) patients. Shown are P values by student t-test.
(E) The differential expression distribution of cytokines for severe onset (n=38), moderate
onset (n=18) and convalescent (n=48+35) versus healthy control (n=20). The triangle
represents severe onset versus healthy controls. Circle stands for moderate onset versus
healthy controls. The square stands for convalescent versus healthy controls. All rings in
the plot from the inside to the outside represent the range of P value, which are P > 0.05,
0.01< P 0.05, 0.001< P 0.01, 0.0001< P 0.001 and P < 0.0001 respectively. Red
indicates positive and blue indicates negative. Size for the triangle, circle and square
means log2 (fold change). Two-sided unpaired t test. HC, healthy control.
(F) Bar graphs showing cytokine concentration at the serum levels of CCL5 and IL16 from
healthy controls (n=5), convalescent (n=7), non-severe (n=4), severe (n=4), death case
(n=7) patients. Kruskal-Wallis H-test between non-severe, severe and death case.
In panel (D) and panel (F), all points are shown and bars represent mean with the 95%
confidence intervals. DC, dendritic cells. Mega, megakaryocytes. Mono, monocytes.

Figure S7. Intercellular interaction alterations among cell types between
severe and moderate onset sample groups.
(A). Circos plot showing the prioritized interactions mediated by ligand-receptor pairs
between inflammation-related cell subtypes for each tissue, namely, PBMC (left panel) and
BALF (right panel). The outer ring displays color coded cell types and the inner ring
represents the involved ligand-receptor interacting pairs. The line width and arrow width are
proportional to the log fold change between severe onset and moderate onset patient
