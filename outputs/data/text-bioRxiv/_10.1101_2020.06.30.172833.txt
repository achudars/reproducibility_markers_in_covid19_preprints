Abstract:

28

The ongoing spread of pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute

29

Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In the lack of specific drugs or vaccines for

30

SARS-CoV-2, demands rapid diagnosis and management are crucial for controlling the outbreak

31

in the community. Here we report the development of the first rapid-colorimetric assay capable of

32

detecting SARS-CoV-2 in the human nasopharyngeal RNA sample in less than 30 minutes. We

33

utilized a nanomaterial-based optical sensing platform to detect RNA-dependent RNA

34

polymerase (RdRp) gene of SARS-CoV-2, where the formation of oligo probe-target hybrid led to

35

salt-induced aggregation and changes in gold-colloid color from pink to blue in visible range.

36

Accordingly, we found a change in colloid color from pink to blue in assay containing

37

nasopharyngeal RNA sample from the subject with clinically diagnosed COVID-19. The colloid

38

retained pink color when the test includes samples from COVID-19 negative subjects or human

39

papillomavirus (HPV) infected women. The results were validated using nasopharangeal RNA

40

samples from suspected COVID-19 subjects (n=136). Using RT-PCR as gold standard, the assay

41

was found to have 85.29% sensitivity and 94.12% specificity. The optimized method has detection

42

limit as little as 0.5 ng of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Overall, the developed assay rapidly detects SARS-

43

CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples in a cost-effective manner and would be useful in pandemic

44

management by facilitating mass screening.

Introduction:

50

Coronavirus disease is rapidly spreading across the world and raising severe global health

51

concerns. In December 2019, China reported the first disease case in its Hubei Province. Based

52

on the phylogenetic analysis, the identified novel coronavirus is named as Severe Acute

53

Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease spread by SARS-CoV-2

54

is known as “COVID-19”, declared as a pandemic by World Health Organization

55

(WHO)(https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-

56

2019?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-u-Pz9vW6QIVUyUrCh0kjAlOEAAYASAAEgJ0pvD_BwERemuzzi).

57

Despite global massive efforts to control the outbreak of COVID-19, this pandemic is still on the

58

rise. To date, lack of approved medicine or vaccine impede escalated the management of the

59

COVID-19 epidemic. In the absence of an effective treatment strategy, developing affordable

60

screening for rapid diagnosis is critically required in the management of COVID-19 (Udugama et

61

al. 2020). According to the WHO, the immediate priority is the development of point-of-care tests

62

for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 at an early stage with improved sensitivity(Report of the WHO-

63

China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19); WHO 2017).

64

Currently, the COVID-19 diagnostic test falls into two categories: antibody and nucleic acid-based

65

detection systems. The Developed immunoassay is rapid but inefficient for the detection of the

66

pathogen at an early stage of infection.(Udugama et al. 2020) Besides, WHO does not currently

67

recommend the use of antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests for patient care, but encourages the

68

related research to improve their performance and potential diagnostic utility (Division of Viral

69

Diseases. CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel;

70

Division of Viral Diseases 2020).

71

Among the nucleic acid-based detection systems, the WHO considered a Real-time polymerase

72

chain reaction (RT-PCR) based method as a gold standard for COVID-19 testing (Division of Viral

73

Diseases. CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel;

74

Division of Viral Diseases 2020). The sample-to-result time of the quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-

75

PCR) was initially >4 hrs; however, constant efforts are underway to improve the turn-around time

76

through automation. Besides, time-consuming process PCR based tests are expensive; they

77

require sophisticated instruments and expertise (Udugama et al. 2020). Thus, other technologies,

78

such as reverse transcription- loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) (Kashir and

79

Yaqinuddin 2020) and Genome-editing (Broughton et al. 2020), are being explored. These are

80

promising technologies; however, the expected turn-around time would still be around 1 hour and

81

may not be economical for mass screening, especially for the developing countries.

82

Nanomaterials based sensing platforms hold promise to develop rapid disease diagnostics.

83

However, their limited use in the clinical setting is due to the need for sophisticated equipment

84

(Chen et al. 2020; Qiu et al. 2020). A recent attempt to use antisense-nucleotide capped gold

85

nanoparticles for N-gene based, COVID-19 detection could be a game changer (Moitra et al.

86

2020). Whereas, WHO suggested that N-gene has a relatively weak analytical capability,

87

compared to the RdRp gene, to detect COVID-19 infection (Corman et al. 2020). Moreover, the

88

authors have demonstrated COVID-19 detection in a cellular-model system, and application in

89

human samples has yet to be shown.

90

In this study, we report for the first time gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) based rapid colorimetric assay

91

for visual eye detection of COVID-19 RNA in human samples designed to target RdRp specific

92

gene target in very cost-effective manner with wide application of mass screening in field. We

93

utilized the surface plasmon resonance property of AuNPs to detect unamplified COVID-19 RNA

94

in human samples. The ability of AuNPs to preferentially adsorb ssRNA/ssDNA over

95

dsDNA/dsRNA is the crucial concept of this assay. The single and double-stranded

96

oligonucleotides have different electrostatic properties, which provide stability (via retaining

97

natural color) and aggregation (which causes color change) of AuNPs in solution, respectively

98

(Jain et al. 2006).

Materials and Methods

101

Chemicals:

102

Citrate buffer stabilized AuNPs (10 nm diameter) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (Thermo Fisher

103

Scientific India Private Limited). Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS pH 7.0) and NaCl were procured

104

from Sigma Aldrich.

105

Clinical samples:

106

Nasopharyngeal RNA sample from subjects suspected have COVID-19 infectioon (n=136) were

107

used. The COVID-19 testing of these subjects were done in the Indian Council of Medical

108

Research (ICMR, India) approved diagnostic laboratory using Taqman-based RT-PCR kit

109

(Labgun, lab, Genomics.co. Ltd, Republic of Korea). The study protocol to use clinical samples

110

was approved by Institutional Human Ethics Committee SGPGIMS, Lucknow (Ref N.

111

PGI/BE/327/2020). The cervical DNA samples from human papilloma virus (HPV) infected woman

112

(n=2) was used as non-specific target control. The clinical Samples (cervical smear) for the HPV

113

DNA test were processed using HPV Test Hybrid Capture® 2 protocol (QIAGEN). Samples with

114

relative light units (RLU) /Cutoff Value ratios > 1.0 were considered as HPV positive and < 1.0

115

were considered as HPV negative. Only HPV positive DNA samples were used during validation

116

experiments.

117

In Vitro transcription (IVT) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA:

118

The RNA (5ng) from confirmed COVID-19 positive human sample were first reverse transcribed

119

with modified oligo dT primer having a T7 promoter sequence at its 5’ end, and the resulting single

120

stranded cDNA was further In-vitro transcribed (IVT) using HiScribe T7 Quick High Yield RNA

121

Synthesis Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (New England BioLabs Inc, NEB #E2050).

122

The amplified RNA was than purified using Monarch RNA Cleanup Kit (New England BioLabs

123

Inc.) and quantified by RNA HS reagent using Qubit system (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Colorimetric assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA:

125

For colorimetric assay, reaction was set up in 10 µL of reaction volume in sterile PCR tubes,

126

containing (a) hybridization buffer containing 80mM NaCl), (b) 0.5 µM oligo probe for RdRp genes,

127

and (c) target RNA from positive patients or IVT RNA. The RdRp oligo probe (5’-

128

GTGATATGGTCATGTGTGGCGG-3’) was used to specifically detect the presence of SARS-

129

CoV-2

130

from different source such nasopharyngeal RNA from COVID negative subjects and HPV DNA

131

from cervical cancer positive samples were used as negative controls. Similarly, non-template

132

control (NTC) was also included to measure the background reactivity. In addition, to confirm the

133

working principle of the assay, a different RNA template (isolated from pancreas) and pancreas

The final reaction mixture with above combinations was then denatured at 95°C for 30

137

seconds, annealed at 60°C for 60 seconds and then cooled to room temperature for 10 minutes.

138

Subsequently, 10 nM colloidal AuNPs (~10 nm) were added to the assay mixture and allowed to

139

develop color for 1-2 minute.

140

Spectral studies and measurement of sensitivity:

141

Absorption spectrum of the assay mixture was recorded in the range of 300 -700 nm. The peak

142

shift from 520 nm (known as red-shift) and peak broadening after 520 nm were measured as a

143

characteristic feature of the salt induced aggregation. Using various combinations of positive and

144

negative controls (as discussed in the previous section) the specificity of reaction and aggregation

145

were compared. Assay sensitivity was determined by serially diluting the input SARS-CoV-2 RNA

146

from both the IVT synthesized and, synthetic SARS-CoV-2 control (nCov19 control kit by Applied

147

Biosystems) ranging from 5- 0.1ng and 1-0.1ng concentrations respectively.

Statistical Analysis:

149

Diagnostic accuracy of the new colour test was calculated by assuming RT-PCR as gold standard

150

method. Sensitivity (True Positive rate), Specificity (True Negative rate) and overall accuracy

151

(True positive and true negative rate) were calculated with 95% confidence interval. Likelihood

152

ratio positive (sensitivity / false positive rate), Likelihood ratio negative (false negative rate /

153

specificity), Positive predictive value (True positive value / Total positive results predicted by

154

colour test), Negative predictive value (True negative value / Total negativeresults predicted by

155

colour test) were also calculated. Measured accuracy was considered statistically significant

156

(p<0.05) when 50% did not falling within the confidence limit for values given in % whereas LR

157

are considered significant when 1 was falling within confidence limit. Statistical analyses were

158

performed using software MedCalc for Windows (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium).

Result and discussion:

160

In this study, we report for the first time the development of a rapid and affordable RNA-based

161

assay for the visual detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in human samples. Using RT-PCR as

162

gold standard, the developed assay was found to have a sensitivity of 85.29% and sepcififcity of

164

nanoparticles/colloids (AuNP) and targeted the RdRp specific gene sequence of SARS-CoV-

165

2. RdRp is essential for viral replication and has higher analytical power than E (envelope protein)

166

and N (nucleocapsid protein) genes of SARS-CoV-2 (Corman et al. 2020). Our current

167

established assay, salt-induced aggregation and color change of the gold colloids occurs

168

after RdRp oligo probe hybridizes with its specific target RNA of SARS-CoV-2. With the current

169

escalated demand of cost effective, easy and sensitive diagnostic for COVID-19, the test was

170

developed using commercially available nCoV19 synthetic DNA and validated further using

171

clinical samples from COVID-19 subjects (as confirmed using Taqman based RT-PCR method,

172

Table S1). In our study, we demonstrated a visual change in gold colloid color from pink to blue

with RdRp oligo probe. Simultaneously, the color remained pink in SARS-CoV-2 negative

175

samples due to the absence of hybridization.

176

In the study, out of 136 samples, 50% samples (n=68) were true positive (COVID-19 Positive)

177

and 50% samples (n=68) true negative (Free from COVID-19 disease) confirmed by gold standard

178

diagnostic test RT-PCR. These true positive and negative samples were again tested by New

179

Colour test to assess the diagnostic accuracy of our new test (Table 1). Result showed that

180

sensitivity (true positive rate) of the new test was 85.29% (58/68) and specificity (true negative

181

rate) of 94.12% (64/68) with statistically significant (each p value<0.05). Overall diagnostic

182

accuracy of the new colour test was 89.71% (122/136) with statistically significant (p<0.05).

183

Likelihood ratio positive indicated that new colour test has 14.50 times more chances to detect

184

true positive rate (w.r.t. false positive rate) and Likelihood ratio negative of 0.16 i.enew colour test

185

has 6.25 times more chances to detect true negative rate (w.r.t. false negative rate).(each

186

p<0.05).

187

prediction of true positive results from its own positive predicted results would be 93.55% and

188

Negative predictive value (NPV) of 86.49% showed that probability to the correct prediction of

189

true negative results from its own negative predicted results would be 86.49% (each p<0.05)

190

(Table 2).

191

Figure 1 illustrates the sequential schematics of process of the developed test. The color of the

192

gold colloid solution is dependent on the aggregation property of AuNPs in suspension (Hunter

193

1991; Lazarides and Schatz 2000). The aggregation-induced color change can be visually

194

monitored (by the naked eye) and quantitated through absorption spectroscopy.

195

aqueous solution, gold colloids remain stabilized by the coating of negatively charged citrate ions

196

(Grabar et al. 1995) and have visible appearance of pink color (Figure 1). In solution, individual

197

particle exhibits a surface plasmon resonance peak (λmax) at 520 nm (Figure 2a, Green curve).

198

The oligonucleotide probe preferentially adsorbs on AuNPs and provides additional stability due

199

to the addition of negative charges (Li and Rothberg 2004). The same phenomenon was observed

Positive predicted value (PPV) of 93.55% showed that probability to the correct

200

in our experiments when RdRp oligo probe adsorbed and protected the salt-induced aggregation

201

of colloid in the absence of target RNA (NTC) (Figure 2a, Grey curve). Except for the reduced

202

intensity of the absorption spectrum, which was due to dilution of the colloid (Figure 2a, Grey

203

curve), NTC and AuNP assays showed no change? A pure colloid is pink in color (Inset of Figure

204

2a left vial), which turns into light pink when it reacts with hybridization buffer containing oligo

205

probe in equal volume (without target) (Inset of Figure 2a right vial). Unlike dsDNA, inherent

206

structural flexibility of ssDNA/RNA to partially uncoil its bases, exposing them to AuNPs,

207

generates the attractive electrostatic forces causing them to allow over colloids and giving

208

protection against electrostatic interaction causing salt-induced aggregation (Li and Rothberg

209

2004).

210

In this assay, SARS-CoV-2 RNA from human patients or IVT synthesized RNA was added into

211

hybridization buffer (containing oligo probe), followed by denaturation and annealing at 95°C (30s)

212

and 60°C (60s), respectively. After cooling at room temperature, the gold colloid was added into

213

the above reaction mixture. The colloid color changes in visible range from pink to blue, indicate

214

the formation of hybridized product (Figure 2b-c, and Figure 3). Broadening of the peak with red-

215

shift (~30 nm) was observed in the spectrum of aggregated colloids than non-aggregated,

216

confirms the success of developed assay for detection of an unamplified target with unmodified

217

colloids in a quick and facile way. The principle of binding oligo probe to its specific target leading

218

to change in color of the solution was independently verified using a different template RNA

219

(isolated from pancreas tissue) and pancreas specific gene REG3 oligo probe in a separate

220

assay. This assay also resulted in a similar change in color and absorption spectra as optimized

221

earlier for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and RdRp oligo probe. It established the working principle and

222

specificity of the test (Figure S1).

223

We determined the cross-reactivity using a cervical-DNA sample from women diagnosed with

224

HPV infection (non-specific target control). No color change of gold colloids was observed with

225

HPV DNA, indicating no hybridization, and specificity of the developed assay (Figure 3 b, right

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.30.172833; this version posted December 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

226

vial). Contrary to HPV DNA-negative control and NTC, a positive control sample shows

227

development of blue color (Figure 3 b, middle vial). Absorption spectrum (of colloids) with HPV

228

DNA-negative control exhibited characteristics similar to that of NTC, and no red-shift or peak

229

broadening as found with positive samples (Figure 3a). Cross-reactivity of the developed assay

230

with other respiratory viruses is warranted. However, we do not anticipate the same as the test

231

utilizes the detection of the RdRp gene of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The oligo probe sequence used

232

in our assay is not complementary to any human mRNAs and other members of the SARS family,

233

as verified by BLAST using the NCBI database.

234

IVT synthesized SARS-CoV-2 RNA was used to test the sensitivity of the developed assay. RNA

235

ranging from 0.1 to 5ng resulted in a gradual change in colloid color from light pink to blue (Figure

236

4b). The color difference at 0.1 ng, compared to NTC, is barely visible with naked eyes (Figure 4

237

b extreme left vial). However, the absorption spectra of colloids show a clear red-shift with peak

238

broadening up till 0.5 ng target RNA (Figure 4a).

239

We also determined the assay sensitivity using different dilutions (1-0.1ng) of PCR-amplified

240

synthetic DNA (positive control, with nCoV19 control kit). Similar to IVT synthesized RNA, a

241

decreasing amount of DNA (from 1 to 0.1 ng) show a gradual change in colloid color from blue to

242

light pink (left to right, Fig. 4d). A clear red-shift with peak broadening reflects in the absorption

243

spectra of colloids recorded with control DNA, compared to NTC (Fig. 4c). Accordingly, positive

244

control showed a clear visual demarcation up to 0.5 ng amount, compared to NTC (Fig. 4d). A

245

similar recent approach utilizes thiol capped gold nanoparticles to detect N-gene of the SARS-

246

CoV-2 gene in a cellular system (Moitra et al. 2020). However, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2

247

RNA in human samples, the N-gene has reportedly inferior analytical power than the RdRp gene

248

(Corman et al. 2020). Thus, it would be essential to know the assay's performance, developed by

249

Moitra et al., with clinical samples.

251

Conclusions:

252

We have successfully developed an affordable gold nanoparticles-based colorimetric test for the

253

rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in humans. The assay can detect up to 0.5 ng of SARS-

254

CoV-2 RNA. The turnaround time of our assay is less than 30 minutes. Moreover, the developed

255

test will be helpful for mass screening, as it does not require sophisticated equipment. However,

256

while analyzing the clinical samples we observed the assay works best with the freshly isolated

257

RNA samples. In addition, pH and salt concentration in the elution buffer, used for RNA isolation,

258

may affect the result and hence optimization may be needed when using a different kit for RNA

259

isolation.

Figure 1. Schematic representation of the assay for the visual detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA
Schematic illustrates the assay flow to detect RdRp (RNA dependent RNA polymerase) gene sequence
of SARS-CoV-2 in the nasopharyngeal RNA sample from subject clinically diagnosed with nCOVID
infection (positive control). Hybridization buffer with RdRp oligo probe (forward) was mixed with
RNA sample. The reaction mixture was denatured at 95°C for 30 seconds, followed by annealing at
60° C for 60 seconds. After annealing, the tube was kept at room temperature for 10 minutes before
colloidal AuNPs were added. A pure colloid is pink in color. It turns blue in the vial containing RNA
sample from positive control due to salt-induced aggregation upon successful hybridization between
oligo probe and target RNA. The color remained pink in the absence of target RNA, or the presence
of a non-specific target.

Figure 2. Colorimetric assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
(a) Comparative absorption spectra of unmodified AuNPs (Green curve) and oligo probe stabilized AuNPs i.e.,
NTC (Grey curve). Both spectra are exhibiting characteristics absorption peak at λmax 520 nm, however, the
reduced peak intensity in NTC is due to dilution of colloid solution. In NTC, no red-shift in peak position, approve
the stabilizing property of single-stranded oligo probe, Optical images of gold colloids (left vial) and NTC (right
vial) are shown in the inset. (b) Comparative absorption spectra of NTC (Grey curve) and positive control i.e.,
nasopharyngeal RNA sample from subject clinically diagnosed with nCOVID infection (Brown curve).
Broadening of the peak as well as red-shift in peak position confirm the salt-induced aggregation of AuNP due
to successful hybrid formation in control. Optical images shown in inset demonstrate the evident change in the
color of the solution from pink to blue in the control vial (right) while no change in color of NTC vial (left). (c)
representative absorption spectra, and in the inset shows optical images comparing assay performed with NTC
(Grey curves, left vial), RNA from clinically diagnosed nCOVID infected subjects (Brown curve, middle vial), and
RNA from subjects without nCOVID infection (Yellow curve, right vial). Samples from a total of eighteen infected
and eighteen uninfected individuals were analyzed (optical images were attached as supplimentry figure S2).

Figure 3. Specificity of developed assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
Nasopharyngeal-RNA from nCOVID infected subject (positive control), and a cervical DNA sample from
Human papillomavirus (HPV, non-specific target control) infected women were tested. (a) Comparative
absorption spectra for no target control (NTC, Grey curve), positive control (Brown curve), and non-specific
target control (HPV, Yellow curve). In the positive control, the broadening of the peak and red-shift in peak
position (Brown curve) confirmed the salt-induced aggregation upon successful hybrid
formation. (b) Optical pictures demonstrate that the colloid color from pink to blue changes only in the
vial with the positive control (middle vial), while the color remained pink in the vial with NTC (left vial) or
HPV (right vial).
