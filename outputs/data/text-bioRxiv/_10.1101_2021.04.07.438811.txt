Summary
SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for COVID-19, a human disease that has caused over 2 million deaths,
stretched health systems to near-breaking point and endangered the economies of countries and
families around the world. Antiviral treatments to combat COVID-19 are currently lacking. Remdesivir,
the only antiviral drug approved for the treatment of COVID-19, can affect disease severity, but better
treatments are needed. SARS-CoV-2 encodes 16 non-structural proteins (nsp) that possess different
enzymatic activities with important roles in viral genome replication, transcription and host immune
evasion. One key aspect of host immune evasion is performed by the uridine-directed
endoribonuclease activity of nsp15. Here we describe the expression and purification of nsp15
recombinant protein. We have developed biochemical assays to follow its activity, and we have found
evidence for allosteric behaviour. We screened a custom chemical library of over 5000 compounds to
identify nsp15 endoribonuclease inhibitors, and we identified and validated NSC95397 as an inhibitor
of nsp15 endoribonuclease in vitro. Although NSC95397 did not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 growth in VERO
E6 cells, further studies will be required to determine the effect of nsp15 inhibition on host immune
evasion.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 (severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome coronavirus-2) is the coronavirus that causes the
human coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [1, 2]. SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV caused severe
diseases in 2003 and 2012, respectively, and, although their consequences in terms of worldwide loss
of human life cannot be compared to the devastating health and economic crisis caused by COVID-19
pandemic, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 indicates a pattern of recurrent coronavirus diseases with
relevance for human health [3, 4]. Some features of SARS-CoV-2 have been pinpointed as key to
explain the catastrophic consequences of COVID-19; an easy air-transmissibility, a large percentage
of asymptomatic infections, and the ability of the virus to infect multiple cell types and organs and
deregulate the immune system [5-9].
In a major international effort, multiple vaccines are being developed and several are already being
administered. It is still uncertain whether vaccines will fully prevent future infections or lead to milder
COVID-19 infections [10]. Most vaccines are being developed against the spike protein of the virus, a
structural protein that evolves rapidly and, therefore, might not be a long-term solution to COVID-19

and, moreover, is unlikely to provide a pan-coronavirus solution [11, 12]. There is currently a lack of
antiviral treatments that efficiently combat coronavirus infections. Remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue
chain terminator proven to reduce viral growth, is the only antiviral approved for the treatment of
COVID-19 [13]. However, a WHO-funded clinical trial recently failed to demonstrate a reduction in
deaths amongst patients treated with remdesivir [14]. Therefore, the further development of efficient
antiviral treatments to combat diverse coronavirus infections will remain important for health systems
worldwide to face present and future coronavirus pandemics.
SARS-CoV-2 is a (+) single-strand RNA virus that belongs to the family Coronaviridae of the order
Nidovirales, which includes viruses with the largest known RNA genomes [15-17]. The first two-thirds
of the genome encode two open-reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, that are directly translated from
the viral genome producing two large polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) that contain the 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) of the virus. These polyproteins are cleaved by the proteolytic activities of
nsp3 and nsp5, which therefore modulate the activity of the rest of the enzymes and promote the
formation of active protein complexes including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(nsp12/nsp7/nsp8), the RNA helicase (nsp13), the RNA exoribonuclease (nsp14/nsp10), the RNA
endoribonuclease (nsp15) and the RNA Cap methyltransferases (nsp14 and nsp16/nsp10), which
together support proliferation of the virus. Therefore, coronaviruses contain a wide variety of enzymes
that are potential targets for the development of novel antivirals, by comparison with many other
viruses.
nsp15 contains a C-terminal ‘EndoU’ domain (endoribonuclease uridylate-specific) that is able to
cleave the 3’ end of pyrimidines, preferentially uridylates, in the context of single and double stranded
RNA molecules [18-21]. Purified nsp15 can exist as an inactive monomer or trimer, or an active
hexamer [22, 23]. Oligomerisation relies on N-terminal residues of nsp15 and activity is dependent on
the presence of divalent metal ions, with a preference for Mn2+ [19, 23, 24]. The EndoU activity of
nsp15 is dispensable for replication of viral RNA genome [20, 25]. Instead, nsp15 EndoU activity
appears to mediate the evasion of host recognition of viral dsRNA, and growth of EndoU-deficient
viruses is severely affected in mouse models and primary immune cells such as macrophages [21,
26, 27]. Therefore, nsp15 EndoU inhibitors might be useful to potentiate the host immune response to
SARS-CoV-2.

In March 2020, we initiated a large project to identify inhibitors of multiple SARS-CoV-2 enzymes from
a custom chemical library containing over 5000 compounds. Here we describe the results of a screen
for nsp15 endoribonuclease inhibitors.

Results
Purified SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 has uridylate-specific endoribonuclease activity in vitro
We expressed and purified a series of N-terminally tagged versions of nsp15 from bacteria and insect
cells (Figure 1A). Nsp15 eluted as a high molecular weight complex during size-exclusion
chromatography, consistent with nsp15 existing as a hexamer [22, 23] (Supplementary Figure S1A).
Removal of the affinity tags with proteases was generally inefficient, consistent with a recent structural
study that showed that the N-terminus of nsp15 is not on the surface of the nsp15 hexamer [28]. After
partial digestion of 14His-SUMO-nsp15 with Ulp1 SUMO protease, untagged nsp15 eluted much later
during size-exclusion chromatography, suggesting the untagged protein was primarily present in a
smaller complex or as a monomer (Supplementary Figure S1A and S1B).
To evaluate nsp15 endoribonuclease activity, we used a 16 nt single stranded RNA substrate labelled
with a Cy3 fluorophore, which contained a single uridine near the centre (Figure 1B). N-terminal MBP, 14His-SUMO-, 6His- and 3xFLAG-6His- tagged versions of nsp15 were able to cleave this substrate,
whereas the nsp15-2A mutant in which two key Histidine residues (H234A H249A) were replaced with
alanine, did not [29] (Figure 1C). Notably, untagged nsp15 generated from the digestion of 14HisSUMO-nsp15, was inactive as an endoribonuclease consistent with the idea that only the hexameric
form of nsp15 is active [22, 23, 30]. We selected 6His-nsp15 for use in subsequent screening and
validation assays. Whilst this enzyme was active on the uridylate-containing substrate, it had no
detectable activity on a substrate in which the single uridine was substituted for cytidine (Figure 1D).
Taken together, these results show that the purified 6His-nsp15 possesses uridylate-specific
endoribonuclease activity, consistent with previous data [22, 23, 30].
Assay to study kinetic SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 endoribonuclease activity in solution
To perform a high-throughput screen for inhibitors of nsp15, we first developed an assay to quantify
nsp15 endoribonuclease activity in solution without the need to visualise products in a gel. We used a
short (6 nt) single stranded RNA oligonucleotide containing a single uridine and a 5’ Cy5 that was
quenched by proximity to a 3’ BBQ-650 quencher. This substrate only exhibits fluorescence upon

cleavage by nsp15, when the Cy5 is no longer in proximity to the quencher (Figure 2A). We found that
nsp15 was able to cleave the 16 nt (Figure 2B, top) and 6 nt (Figure 2B, bottom) substrates at similar
enzyme concentrations. As expected, fluorescent signal from the 3 nt cleavage product was only
detectable upon substrate cleavage. The uridylate specificity of nsp15 was confirmed again by its lack
of activity on a 6 nt substrate containing cytidine in place of uridine (Figure 2C).
Prior to performing the screen to identify inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 nsp15, we adapted the in-solution
fluorescent biochemical assay to a multi-well plate format. We first performed a titration of nsp15 and
were able to detect Cy5 fluorescence on a plate reader in a time and enzyme concentrationdependent manner (Figure 2D). As seen in gel-based assays, nsp15 exhibited reduced endonuclease
activity toward the C substrate when using the plate reader (Figure 2E) and, accordingly, the nsp152A catalytically inactive mutant did not produce fluorescent signal on either substrate (Figure 2F). In
parallel, the nuclease RNase A showed efficient cleavage of both substrates (Figure 2G). As the
compounds in the chemical library to be used for the screen were stored in DMSO, we also tested
nsp15 activity in the presence of DMSO and found DMSO at concentrations up to 5% had only a
slight inhibitory effect on enzyme activity (Figure 2H).
Fluorescent biochemical kinetic screen for SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 inhibitors
We next used this assay to determine the effect of substrate concentration on initial reaction
velocities. We found that, in contrast to all of the other enzymes we have examined in this series of
papers (see accompanying manuscripts), reaction rates did not plateau at higher substrate
concentrations but instead continued to increase non-linearly, indicating that nsp15 endoribonuclease
behaves as an allosteric enzyme towards the 6 nt U substrate, with a Khalf of 2140 nM (Figure 3A and
Supplementary Figure S2A).
We performed the screen with 75 nM nsp15 enzyme and 500 nM substrate, which produced reactions
that were linear over the 15 min of reaction monitoring, against a library of over 5000 commercial
compounds. These compounds were dispensed in DMSO over 24 384-well plates, and we tested two
concentrations: 1.25 µM (low) and 3.75 µM (high). For the screen, we dispensed the nsp15 enzyme
and incubated it with the drugs at room temperature (RT) for 10 min, after which we dispensed the
substrate and started monitoring Cy5 fluorescence every minute for 15 minutes (Figure 3B and
Supplementary Figure S2B). We included extra wells in every plate to control for any change in
enzyme kinetics that could affect the identification of inhibitors (Supplementary Figure S2B). The Z’

factor was calculated for each plate, and the average Z’ factor for the whole screen was 0.8 indicating
a high-quality screen (Supplementary Figure S2C). One plate of the high compound concentration
had a Z’ factor <0.5 and was omitted from analysis.
Reaction slopes in the presence of each compound were calculated and normalised to the DMSOcontaining positive controls (control reactions) on each plate (Figure 3C and Supplementary Figure
S2B). We did not find any inhibitors that showed residual activities <0.7 in both concentrations, which
was surprising given the results of similar screens from our accompanying manuscripts. Therefore,
we considered compounds that had residual activities <0.9 and had a Z-score <-4 (Figure 3E and
Supplementary Figure S2D). We also considered hits that decreased activity further in the high
concentration than the low concentration, even if both residual activities were not below our cut-offs.
Validation of Hits
We selected 17 compounds of the top hits from the screen for further analysis (Supplementary Table
S3). We performed a test to determine if any of the 17 compounds quenched Cy5 fluorescence. Four
compounds (in red) quenched Cy5 fluorescence in a concentration-dependent manner
(Supplementary Figure S3). We then assessed inhibition of nsp15 endoribonuclease activity with the
12 remaining compounds using the plate reader (Supplementary Figure S4). Only NSC95397 and
BMS-1166 compounds were able to inhibit nsp15 endoribonuclease activity at 10 µM (Figure 4A and
Supplementary Figure S4). To explore inhibition by the top hit compounds further, we returned to the
gel-based assay and assessed nsp15 endoribonuclease activity using the 16 nt substrate (Figure 4B).
Again, NSC95397 (drug 10) inhibited nsp15 endoribonuclease. BMS-1166 did not inhibit the enzyme
even at 100 µM in the gel-based assays. GNF-PF-3777 (drug 6) had been chosen for its high score
as a putative activator of nsp15 (Supplementary Table S3) but had no effect even at 100 µM in the
gel-based assays (Figure 4B). WEHI-539 hydrochloride (drug 1), selected from the screen as a
putative nsp15 inhibitor and later found to quench Cy5 fluorescence (Supplementary Figure S3),
enhanced nsp15 endoribonuclease activity in the gel-based assay (Figure 4B).
To study the specificity of NSC95397 towards nsp15, we tested whether RNase A and benzonase
activities were inhibited by NSC95397. Again, NSC95397 inhibited nsp15 endoribonuclease activity,
but did not inhibit RNase A or benzonase, indicating that NSC95397 is not a general nuclease
inhibitor (Figure 4C).

To determine the range of concentration of NSC95397 able to inhibit nsp15 endoribonuclease, we
titrated NSC95397 and estimated the IC50 (43 µM) of NSC95397 inhibition of nsp15 endoribonuclease
(Figure 4D and 4E).
Effects of NSC95397 on SARS-CoV-2 growth in VERO E6 cells
Previous work has suggested that nsp15 activity plays a role in host recognition and response and is
dispensable for viral replication and growth [21, 25, 27]. However, another study found that nsp15
inhibitors reduced SARS-CoV-1 viral growth in VERO E6 cells [31]. The compounds they used
inhibited nsp15 endoribonuclease activity in vitro, but they also inhibited other ribonucleases. So,
these results could be explained by inhibition of nsp15 or other viral or host RNases. Since the
compound from our screen, NSC95397, selectively inhibited nsp15 and not RNase A or benzonase,
we used NSC95397 to determine whether specific inhibition of nsp15 reduces SARS-CoV-2 viral
growth in VERO E6 cells.
We infected VERO E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of a range of concentrations of
NSC95397 and quantified viral infected area (Figure 5A and 5B). NSC95397 killed VERO E6 cells at
concentrations above 10 μM, consistent with previous reports that NSC95397 is an inhibitor of the
Cdc25 protein phosphatase and multiple protein kinases [32-35]. This made it more difficult to assess
viral growth. With the aim of finding a concentration of NSC95397 that inhibited viral growth without
killing the cells, we performed a second titration at lower NSC95397 concentrations (Figure 5C and
5D). Cell survival was much less impacted, but viral growth was not inhibited by NSC95397 (Figure
5C and 5D).
Mutation of the exoribonuclease activity of nsp14 has been shown to sensitise SARS-CoV-1 to the
antiviral agent remdesivir [36]. To explore if inhibition of the nsp15 endoribonuclease activity also
synergised with remdesivir antiviral activity, we performed infectivity assays in the presence of both
NSC95397 and remdesivir. However, we did not observe any additive effect of these two drugs on
SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in VERO E6 cells (Figure 5E and 5F).

Discussion
We have purified SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 enzyme and optimised fluorescent biochemical
endoribonuclease (EndoU) assays to screen a custom chemical library containing over 5000
characterised commercial compounds. We identified NSC95397 as a novel nsp15 EndoU inhibitor in

vitro. The role of nsp15 endoribonuclease during SARS-CoV-2 proliferation is still unclear [18, 20, 21,
25, 37]. Coronaviruses with mutated nsp15 are viable in viral replication assays yet have severe
growth defects in immune specialised cell models such as macrophages and in immune proficient
mouse models, indicating an essential role for nsp15 in mediating the evasion of the host immune
system [21, 26, 27, 38, 39]. Indeed, nsp15 has been shown to antagonise the production of interferon
beta, and thus its inhibition might also lead to increased interferon production [40]. Macrophages and
other immune cells can become infected with SARS-CoV-2 in human patients, and lung macrophage
dysfunction has been associated with severe COVID-19, consistent with a key role for macrophages
in the early immune response to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections [41-43]. Therefore, the use of nsp15
inhibitors would appear to be an attractive strategy to boost immune recognition of the virus at early
stages of infection.
Although NSC95397 inhibited nsp15 activity in vitro, it did not impair the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2
in VERO E6 cells, which are a commonly used host cell for viral growth under laboratory conditions.
However, VERO E6 are derived from the Green Monkey Chlorocebus sabaeus, and it will be
important in future studies to establish better cellular models with which to assess the importance of
nsp15 for the evasion of host immune responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection of appropriate human
cells.
Being an endoribonuclease, unrestricted nsp15 activity might lead to unwanted cleavage of the viral
genome, so regulation of its activity is likely to be important for balancing its immune evasion function
with viral genome integrity. One level of regulation of nsp15 activity is at the substrate level where
nsp15 shows differential activity towards sequences surrounding the targeted uridylate, as well as
RNA secondary structures and modifications such as 2’-O-methyl groups [18, 44]. The formation of
the nsp15 active hexamer could be another level of regulation [45]. Because nsp15 is only active as a
hexamer, it is likely that nsp15 activity is restricted to later steps of infection when enough nsp15 has
been translated to support hexamer formation. Our results show that nsp15 activity is stimulated at
high substrate concentrations, indicating that nsp15 is an allosteric enzyme, which confirms
predictions based on structural cryo-EM studies of the SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 hexamer [23] (Figure 2,
3A and Supplementary Figure S2A). This allosteric behaviour might serve as an additional control to
limit nsp15 EndoU activity and locally protect the viral RNA. Thus, nsp15 activation might occur at
later times post infection, where the virus has produced enough nsp15 protein and substrate.

Accordingly, in our screen we used high enzyme and substrate concentrations (75 nM nsp15 and 500
nM substrate). However, this high enzyme concentration combined with high substrate competition
(for potential competitive inhibitors) might explain why we did not detect many compounds able to
inhibit nsp15 EndoU activity and our hit compounds only reduced nsp15 activity by 10-20% in the
original conditions of the screen. We and our colleagues were able to detect hits for the other SARSCoV-2 enzymes using the same drug library and general screening strategy (see accompanying
manuscripts) and, therefore, it would be advisable for future studies to use higher compound to
enzyme or substrate ratios to improve detection of nsp15 inhibitors.
We found that NSC95397 is an inhibitor of nsp15 but not a general nuclease inhibitor in vitro. We
looked for compounds previously shown or predicted to inhibit nsp15 in our library and found that,
although none passed our cut-off, some of them also inhibited nsp15 to some degree in our screen
(Supplementary Table S4) [31, 46-48]. Previous studies have found nsp15 to be sensitive to RNase A
inhibitors [31], so, interestingly, our data would suggest that NSC95397 inhibits nsp15 through a
different mechanism (Figure 4C). In addition, though our infectivity assays using VERO E6 cells did
not find NSC95397 to be effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 viral growth, RNase A inhibitors did
reduce SARS-CoV-1 viral growth in VERO cells [31]. This could be due to RNase A inhibitors also
inhibiting the other nuclease in coronaviruses, nsp14, or it could be that the higher viral load and later
timepoint of infection used in that study compared to our infectivity assays could have been more
sensitive to nsp15 inhibition. In agreement with a late infection role for nsp15, nsp15 can specifically
cleave the polyuridine tracks of the later transcribed negative-strand RNA strand of the virus, which
could lead to reducing the activation of cytosolic immune sensors [38]. Future studies could assess
the effects of NSC95397 with late infection conditions, in appropriate human immune cells or in
mouse models, which, as discussed above, are sensitive to nsp15 mutations. In addition, our assays
showed high host cell toxicity in response to NSC95397, so it would also be interesting to test
fluorinated and hydroxylated derivatives of NSC95397, which have been proposed to be less toxic
[49].
Because of its role in immune evasion, treatment with nsp15 inhibitors could be useful early in SARSCoV-2 infection to help elicit a robust immune response to clear the virus. As an alternative strategy,
nsp15 inhibitors could be tested in combination with other treatments to screen for synthetic anti-viral
effects. Our colleagues have identified other SARS-CoV-2 enzyme inhibitors (see accompanying

manuscripts), and it would be interesting to test multiple compounds in a “cocktail” approach to
treating COVID-19.

Experimental Procedures
Expression constructs
We constructed 4 plasmids to express different tagging combinations of nsp15 in Escherichia coli
(E.coli) (Supplementary Table S1 and S2). SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 was codon optimised for bacterial
expression (Genbank MN908947.3) and cloned into BamHI-NotI MCS of pMEXCb vector
(https://mrcppu-covid.bio/cdna-clones/134146) to create plasmid SARS-CoV-2 MBP-nsp15
(DU67734). Plasmid SARS-CoV-2 14His-SUMO-nsp15 (DU70489) was built by PCR with oligos
9142/9143 from DU67734 and Gibson assembly into K27SUMO vector [50]. Plasmid SARS-CoV-2
6His-nsp15 (DU70490) was built by PCR with oligos 9156/9157 from DU67734 followed by PCR
digestion with NcoI and XhoI and ligation into pET28C. Plasmid SARS-CoV-2 His-nsp15 (H234A
H249A) (DU70491) was built by PCR with oligos 9150/9151 from DU70490.
Expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 in E. coli
Rosetta™ (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen) (F- ompT hsdSB (rB- mB-) gal dcm (DE3) pLysSRARE
(CamR) were transformed with plasmid DU70490 to express 6His-nsp15. Transformant colonies were
inoculated into a 400 ml LB / chloramphenicol (35 µg/ml) / kanamycin (50 µg/ml) and grown overnight
at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm. The next morning, the culture was mixed with 3600 ml of LB /
chloramphenicol (35 µg/ml) / kanamycin (50 µg/ml) and further grown at 37°C until OD600 reached 0.8.
Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.4 mM IPTG, and the culture was shaken overnight at
16°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min in a JLA-9.1000 rotor (Beckman).
The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 20 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.5 M NaCl, 10
mM imidazole, 0.5 mM TCEP, Roche protease inhibitor tablets) with 500 µg / ml lysozyme, then
incubated at 4°C for 0.5 h with rotation. Subsequently, the sample was sonicated twice for 90 s (15 s
on, 30 s off) at 40% on a Branson Digital Sonifier. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4°C for 0.5 h in
an JA-30.50 rotor (Beckman), the obtained soluble extract was mixed with 2 ml slurry Ni-NTA beads
(30210, QIAGEN), incubated at 4°C for 2 h with rotation. Beads were recovered in a disposable
gravity flow column and washed with 150 ml of lysis buffer then 20 ml lysis buffer containing 10 mM
MgCl2 and 2 mM ATP (to remove bacterial chaperones) then 20 ml lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted

with 5 ml lysis buffer containing 0.4 M imidazole. The eluate was loaded onto a 120 ml Superdex 200
column in Gel filtration buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.15 M NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP). Nsp15-containing
fractions were pooled, concentrated to 0.6 mg/ml by ultrafiltration using Amicon Ultra centrifugal unit
(30 k MWCO; MERCK), aliquoted and snap frozen.
The 6His-tagged H234A H249A nsp15 mutant was purified as described above. 14His-SUMO-nsp15
was purified as for 6His-nsp15, except that we attempted to remove the 14His-SUMO tag by
overnight Ulp1 cleavage at 4°C before the gel filtration step. Proteolytic cleavage was partial, and the
resultant untagged nsp15 was subsequently separated from 14His-SUMO-nsp15 on a 120 ml
Superdex 200 column equilibrated in gel filtration buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.15 M NaCl, 0.5
mM TCEP).
For purification of MBP-nsp15, Rosetta™ (DE3) pLysS cells were transformed with plasmid DU67734
(pMEX3Cb SARS-CoV2 (2019-nCoV) NSP15). Transformant colonies were inoculated into 200 ml LB
/ chloramphenicol (35 µg/ml) / ampicillin (100 µg/ml) and grown at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm. After
~10 h growth, 100 ml of the culture was mixed with 900 ml of LB / chloramphenicol (35 µg/ml) /
ampicillin (100 µg/ml) and grown at 37°C until OD600 reached 0.8. The protein expression was
induced by addition of 0.2 mM IPTG, and the culture was shaken overnight at 18°C. Cells were
harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min in a JLA-9.1000 rotor (Beckman). The bacterial
pellet was resuspended in 20 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP,
Roche protease inhibitor tablets) and lysed as described for 6His-nsp15. The clarified extract was
mixed with 2 ml amylose beads and incubated at 4°C for 2 h with rotation. Beads were recovered and
washed as for 6His-nsp15. Proteins were eluted with 5 ml lysis buffer containing 10 mM maltose. The
eluate was loaded onto a 120 ml Superdex 200 column in Gel filtration buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8),
0.15 M NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP). Nsp15-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration
using Amicon Ultra centrifugal unit (30 k MWCO; MERCK), aliquoted and snap frozen.
Expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 in insect cells
The plasmid SARS-CoV-2 3xFlag-His-nsp5CS-nsp15 (Addgene ID: 169166) was used to express
3xFlag-His-nsp5CS-nsp15 in baculovirus-infected insect cells (Supplementary Table S1 and S2). The
coding sequence of SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 (NCBI reference sequence NC_045512.2) was codonoptimised for S. frugiperda and synthesised (GeneArt, Thermo Fisher Scientific) (codon optimised
sequence can be found in supplementary information). Nsp15 was subcloned into a modified biGBac

pBIG1a vector containing a pLIB-derived polyhedrin expression cassette [51] to contain an N-terminal
3xFlag-His6 tag (sequence: MDYKDHDGDYKDHDIDYKDDDDKGSHHHHHHSAVLQ-nsp15).
Baculoviruses were generated and amplified in Sf9 cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the EMBacY
baculoviral genome (Trowitzsch et al., J Struct Biol, 2010). For protein expression Sf9 cells were
infected with baculovirus, collected 48 hours after infection, flash-frozen, and stored at -70°C.Cell
pellets were resuspended in pulldown buffer (30 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 250 mM sodium chloride, 5 mM
magnesium acetate, 10% glycerol, 0.02% NP-40 substitute, 1 mM DTT) supplemented with protease
inhibitors (Roche Complete Ultra tablets, 1 mM AEBSF, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and
lysed with a dounce homogenizer. The protein was purified from the cleared lysate by affinity to AntiFLAG M2 Affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) and eluted with pulldown buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml 3xFlag
peptide. Eluate was further purified by gel filtration as described for the bacterially expressed proteins.
SARS-CoV-2 nsp15 endoribonuclease assays
A 16 nt 5’ Cy3-single stranded RNA (ssRNA) substrate (16 nt substrate) was used to monitor the
nsp15 uridine-dependent endoribonuclease activity in gel-based assays (Supplementary Table S2). A
6 nt 5’ Cy5 and 3’ BHQ650 quencher ssRNA substrate (6 nt substrate) was used to quantify nsp15
uridine-dependent endoribonuclease activity in gel-based assays (Figure 2B and 2C) and in solution
using a Spark Multimode microplate reader (Tecan).
The assay, with either substrate, was performed by incubating the enzyme and the substrate at room
temperature in total 20 µl in nsp15 reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM
MnCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.02 % Tween-20, 10 % glycerol and 0.5 mM TCEP). Specific
enzyme and substrate concentrations as well as duration of the reaction is indicated in the figure
legends for each experiment.
High-throughput kinetic endoribonuclease screen
High-throughput screen was performed using a custom collection of over 5000 compounds from
commercial sources (Sigma, Selleck, Enzo, Tocris, Calbiochem, and Symansis). 2.5 or 7.5 nl of a 10
mM stock of the compounds dissolved in DMSO were arrayed and dispensed into square flat-bottom
black 384-well plates containing 1 µl DMSO / well using an Echo 550 (Labcyte), before being sealed
and stored at -80°C.

The day of the screen, plates were initially moved from -80ºC to 4ºC, then moved to room
temperature for at least 30 min prior to the screen. Plates were centrifuged and desealed just prior to
dispensing 10 µl of 2X enzyme mix (150 nM nsp15, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM
MnCl2, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 0.02% Tween20, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM TCEP) using a XRD-384
Reagent Dispenser (FluidX Ltd.) or hand-pippetting control columns (Figure 3B and Supplementary
Figure S2B). After 10 min, 10 µl of 2x substrate mix (1000 nM 6 nt U substrate in same buffer as
enzyme mix) was dispensed and plates were centrifuged. 2 min after dispensing substrate mix, plates
were read with a Spark Multimode microplate reader (Tecan) with the following settings: Excitation
645 nm (+/-10), Emission 675 nm (+/-10), Gain 125, 10 flashes, Z position of 17500, every min for 15
min.
Screen data analysis
The slope of each reaction was determined by linear regression. Residual activity was then calculated
by dividing residual activity in the presence of each compound by the median of the control wells
without drugs of each plate. Z-scores were calculated using the standard deviation and median of
residual activities for each concentration. Plate 24 of the high concentration was omitted from
analysis. Z’ factors were calculated for each plate to determine screen quality according to Zhang et
al. [52].
KM and IC50 calculation
First, we calculated the slope of the reaction in the presence of 75 nM nsp15 and a titration of the 6 nt
U substrate (0 – 1000 nM) considering the first 10 min of the reactions by linear regression. Slopes
were then used to calculate Khalf and VMAX by non-linear fitting to an Allosteric sigmoidal equation
using GraphPad Prism.
Similarly, we calculated the slope of the reaction in the presence of 75 nM nsp15, 6 nt U substrate
(500 nM) and a titration of NSC95397 considering the first 15 min of the reactions by linear
regression. Slopes were then used to calculate percentage of activity relative to the slope obtained
with 0 µM NSC95397. Percent activity for each log10 of the concentration of NSC95397 (µM) were
then used to estimate the IC50 and Hill slopes of NSC95397 for nsp15 endoribonuclease using
GraphPad Prism.

SARS-CoV-2 infectivity assays
Infectivity assays were performed as in the accompanying manuscripts. Briefly, VERO E6 cells were
grown in 96 well imaging plates and transfected with individual gapmers at 0.5 µM using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermofisher). 6 h post transfection, the media was replaced and infected with
SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.5 PFU/cell and, simultaneously, a titration of NSC95397 was added to
different wells with or without the addition of 0.5 µM remdesivir. 22 h post-infection, cells were fixed,
permeabilised and stained for SARS-CoV-2 N-protein using Alexa488-labelled-CR3009 antibody [53]
and nuclei using DRAQ5 (647 nm wavelength). Imaging was performed using a 5x lens in an Opera
Phenix high content screening microscope (Perkin Elmer) equipped with the Harmony software. The
whole well area was delineated, and area of Alexa488/N protein and DRAQ5/DNA signals were
determined for each well. The Alexa488/N intensities were normalised to DRAQ5/DNA and to vehicle
treated samples.

Figure 2. Development of a fluorescent biochemical nsp15 endoribonuclease assay.
A. A 6 nt ssRNA containing a 5’ Cy5 fluorophore quenched by a 3’ BBQ-650 quencher (6 nt U
substrate) was used to assess the activity of nsp15 in gels-based assays and in solution. Upon
addition of the nsp15 endoribonuclease, cleavage of the oligo at its only uridine (U) releases the
quencher, leading to Cy5 fluorescence. A version of this substrate with a cytidine in place of the
uridine (6 nt C substrate) is used to test the uridine specificity of nsp15 cleavage. B. Titration of nsp15
enzyme in the presence of 1 µM of the 16 nt U substrate (upper gel) or 1 µM of the 6 nt U substrate

performed for 30 min at 30°C and resolved in a denaturing TBE-urea denaturing polyacrylamide gel.
Fluorescence of the 6 nt substrate was only observed upon cleavage by nsp15. Appearance of a
fluorescent band above the 3 nt suggests that nsp15 can cleave the 6 nt substrate at more than one
residue. C. The “U” and “C” version of the 6 nt substrate (1 µM) were incubated with different
