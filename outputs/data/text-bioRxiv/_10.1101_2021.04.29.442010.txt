Abstract
Antivirals are urgently needed to combat the global SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic,

22

supplement existing vaccine efforts, and target emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

23

Small molecules that interfere with binding of the viral spike receptor binding domain (RBD) to

24

the host ACE2 receptor may be effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Here we screened

25

512 pure compounds derived from natural products using a high-throughput RBD/ACE2 binding

26

assay and identified (–)-hopeaphenol, a resveratrol tetramer, in addition to vatalbinoside A and

27

vaticanol B, as potent and selective inhibitors of RBD/ACE2 binding and viral entry. For

28

example, (–)-hopeaphenol disrupted RBD/ACE2 binding with a 50% inhibitory concentration

29

(IC50) of 0.11 μM in contrast to an IC50 of 28.3 μM against the unrelated host ligand/receptor

30

binding pair PD-1/PD-L1 (selectivity index = 257.3). When assessed against the USA-

31

WA1/2020 variant, (–)-hopeaphenol also inhibited entry of a VSVΔG-GFP reporter pseudovirus

32

expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike into ACE2-expressing Vero-E6 cells and in vitro replication of

33

infectious virus in cytopathic effect assays (IC50 = 10.2 μM) without cytotoxicity. Notably, (–)-

34

hopeaphenol also inhibited two emerging variants of concern originating from the United

35

Kingdom (B.1.1.7) and South Africa (B.1.351) in both cytopathic effect and spike-containing

36

pseudovirus assays with similar (B.1.1.7) or improved (B.1.351) efficacies over the USA-

37

WA1/2020 variant. These results identify (–)-hopeaphenol and related stilbenoid analogues as

38

potent and selective inhibitors of viral entry across multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants including

39

those with increased infectivity and/or reduced susceptibility to existing vaccines.

42

SARS-CoV-2 antivirals are needed to supplement existing vaccine efforts and target

43

emerging viral variants with increased infectivity or reduced susceptibility to existing vaccines.

44

Here we show that (–)-hopeaphenol, a naturally-occurring stilbenoid compound, in addition to its

45

analogues vatalbinoside A and vaticanol B, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 by blocking the interaction of

46

the viral spike protein with the cellular ACE2 entry receptor. Importantly, in addition to

47

inhibiting the early USA-WA1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 variant, hopeaphenol also inhibits emerging

48

variants of concern including B.1.1.7 (“United Kingdom variant”) and B.1.351 (“South Africa

49

variant”), with improved efficacy against B.1.351. (–)-Hopeaphenol therefore represents a new

50

antiviral lead against infection from multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of

53

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since crossing into humans in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2

54

has continued to cause substantial human morbidity and mortality worldwide. While SARS-

55

CoV-2 vaccines are in development with several approved for emergency use, access to these

56

vaccines remains limited, particularly in low and middle-income countries. Moreover, vaccine

57

hesitancy and ongoing mutation of SARS-CoV-2 increase the risk of vaccine resistance. Finally,

58

no reliable therapeutics are currently available to combat SARS-CoV-2 in those that have

59

already developed COVID-19 or to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 spread to exposed individuals. Thus,

60

SARS-CoV-2 antivirals are urgently needed to complement ongoing vaccination efforts.

61

One attractive therapeutic target of SARS-CoV-2 replication is its binding and entry into

62

host cells, which is induced by the trimeric viral spike glycoprotein (1). A primary cellular

63

receptor of SARS-CoV-2 entry is the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) protein. Viral

64

entry is mediated by the receptor biding domain (RBD) of the S1 segment of spike, which

65

directly interacts with ACE2, while S2 mediates membrane fusion (2-3). Following RBD/ACE2

66

binding, SARS-CoV-2 gains entry to host cells through both an endosomal, clathrin-dependent

67

pathway as well as a clathrin-independent pathway which involves spike protein cleavage by

68

furin, TMPRSS2, and other host proteases (1-2). Antagonism of the RBD/ACE2 interaction

69

would therefore be expected to block SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication.

70

Since its worldwide outbreak in early 2020, SARS-CoV-2 variants have acquired

71

mutations within Spike that enhance binding to ACE2 and increase infectivity, as first detected

72

by the emergence of a D614G mutation which has since spread worldwide (4). More recently,

73

additional variants have emerged with further spike sequence divergence; these include B.1.1.7,

74

which originated in the United Kingdom, and B.1.351 (also called 501Y.V2) from South Africa

75

(5). The B.1.1.7 variant contains an additional N501Y mutation within the RBD that causes

76

reduced antibody neutralization by both convalescent and vaccine sera in vitro (6). Concerningly,

77

the B.1.351 variant, which along with N501Y has also acquired mutations E484K and K417N

78

within the RBD, has further reduced susceptibility to, or escape from, neutralizing antibodies as

79

well as sera from convalescent and vaccine-treated patients and immunized mice (7-8). As these

80

observations may raise future concerns about the long-term efficacy of existing vaccines,

81

additional countermeasures with the potential to target emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants are

82

essential.

83

Pure compounds derived from natural products are a rich source of antivirals including

84

against coronaviruses (9). However, outside of computational studies, few natural products to

85

date have been demonstrated to act on SARS-CoV-2 replication (10). To identify natural

86

product-derived compounds that may inhibit entry across multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants, we

87

developed an AlphaScreen-based RBD/ACE2 interaction assay to screen a pure compound

88

library containing 512 natural products and derivatives sourced predominantly from plants,

89

mushrooms and marine invertebrates of Australia, Papua New Guinea, and neighboring regions

90

(11-12). The top hits from this screen, which included the plant stilbenoids (–)-hopeaphenol,

91

vatalbinoside A, and vaticanol B (Figure 1), were then assessed for in vitro mechanisms of

92

action using SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses and antiviral efficacy using infectious SARS-CoV-2

93

variants encompassing parental and B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants.

97

To identify potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 entry, we used AlphaScreen technology

98

(13) to develop a high-throughput, 384 well plate-based assay to monitor the interaction of

99

SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD with host ACE2 (Figure 2A). Briefly, a SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein

100

derived from USA-WA1/2020 and containing a C-terminal His tag, in addition to a full-length

101

ACE2 peptide with a C-terminal Fc tag, were pre-bound to respective acceptor and donor beads

102

and co-incubated for 3 hours at room temperature. When a ligand/receptor binding event occurs,

103

excitation at 680 nm results in a singlet oxygen transfer between donor and receptor beads,

104

which results in luminescence at 615 nm. Compounds that inhibit binding of RBD to ACE2

105

should therefore inhibit luminescence. In the absence of compounds, we observed that

106

luminescence was highly dependent on concentrations of both RBD and ACE2 (Figure 2A) with

107

a > 200-fold signal to noise ratio and high reproducibility across experiments (Z’ > 0.8) (14).

108

Using this assay, we then screened 512 pure compounds obtained from natural products

109

and semisynthetic derivatives available from Compounds Australia at Griffith University at 1

110

μM, where 9 (1.8%) inhibited > 75% of fluorescence observed in the absence of compounds.

111

Activities of top compounds were then assessed for dose-response profiles, where the three most

112

active hits were a series of stilbenoid resveratrol tetramers including (–)-hopeaphenol,

113

vatalbinoside A, and vaticanol B (Figure 1; Figure 2B). These stilbenoids, exemplified by

114

hopeaphenol, are tetramers of resveratrol available from multiple plant sources (15). Using the

115

RBD/ACE2 AlphaScreen assay described above, dose-response profiles from 5 independent

116

experiments were obtained to calculate 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of 0.11, 0.24, and

117

0.067 μM for hopeaphenol, vatalbinoside A, and vaticanol B, respectively (Table 1). In contrast,

118

almost no activity was observed in this assay by the resveratrol monomer (IC50 > 100 μM;

119

Figure 2B), indicating that inhibition requires a multimeric structure.

120

To confirm selectivity of hopeaphenol and analogues to disrupt the RBD/ACE2

121

interaction, we next assessed their ability to interfere with the unrelated host PD-1/PD-L1

122

ligand/receptor pair using a comparable and previously-described experimental approach (16),

123

where we observed a > 100-fold signal to noise ratio and Z’ > 0.75 (Figure 2C). In this assay,

124

the control PD-1/PD-L1 antagonist BMS-1166 (17) disrupted bead proximity-based fluorescence

125

with an IC50 of 0.0040 μM (Figure 2D) but had no activity against the RBD/ACE2 interaction

126

(IC50 > 100 μM; data not shown). Conversely, hopeaphenol, vatalbinoside A, and vaticinol B

127

were all substantially less effective in disrupting PD-1/PD-L1, with IC50s of 28.3, 23.3, and 16.6

128

μM, respectively (Figures 2D; Table 1). From these two assays, the selectivity indices of

129

hopeaphenol, vatalbinoside A, and vaticanol B [i.e., IC50 (PD-1/PD-L1) / IC50 (RBD/ACE2)]

130

were calculated to be 257.3, 92.9, and 247.8, respectively, indicating high selectivity of these

131

compounds for disrupting the viral RBD/host ACE2 interaction over an unrelated host

132

ligand/receptor pair.

135

Stilbenoids are weak inhibitors of viral main protease
A recent high-throughput virtual screening study proposed that hopeaphenol may act as

136

an inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) by interfering with its active site (18),

137

thereby raising the possibility of hopeaphenol acting on multiple viral targets. To test this

138

possibility, we also developed an Mpro enzymatic assay using an Mpro peptide substrate

139

resembling those described previously (19), where a C-terminal 5-((2-

140

aminoethyl)amino)naphthalele-1-sulfonic acid (EDANS) fluorescent tag is quenched by an N-

141

terminal 4-((4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)azo)benzoic acid (DABCYL) tag. Following incubation

142

with recombinant Mpro, the cleaved substrate affords separation of the EDANS tag from the

143

DABCYL quencher and detection of fluorescence at 490 nm. Compounds that inhibit Mpro

144

activity are therefore expected to inhibit fluorescence. This assay also exhibited a > 10-fold

145

signal to noise ratio and Z’ > 0.6 (Figure 3A) and was adaptable to 384-well screening format.

146

Using this assay, we observed that the control Mpro inhibitor GC-376 blocked enzymatic

147

activity with an IC50 of 0.0052 μM, consistent with previous observations (Figure 3B) (19-20).

148

In contrast, we observed that hopeaphenol, vatalbinoside A, and vaticanol B inhibited Mpro

149

activity with IC50s of 42.5, 68.7 and 47.6 μM, respectively (Figure 3B; Table 1), suggesting

150

that these stilbenoids, while potentially capable of targeting Mpro, are to a first approximation

151

more effective against RBD binding to ACE2.

152
153

Stilbenoids inhibit SARS-CoV-2 spike-dependent viral entry

154

To assess whether hopeaphenol and analogues inhibit viral entry within a cellular

155

context, we generated a single-cycle pseudovirus consisting of a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)

156

backbone lacking the G fusion protein and expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and green

157

fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter (VSVΔG-S-GFP) (21). In our initial experiments, we

158

generated pseudovirus with spike from the USA-WA1/2020 variant. Pseudovirus was then

159

incubated with cells in the presence or absence of stilbenoids. High-content imaging was then

160

used to count total live and infected cells in each culture, as determined by Hoechst-stained

161

nuclei and cellular GFP fluorescence, respectively. Consistent with previous observations (22-

162

23), VSVΔG-S-GFP pseudovirus infected ACE2-expressing cells like Vero-E6 (Figure 4A) (24)

163

but not cell lines lacking ACE2 like BHK-21 cells (data not shown). In this assay, we observed

164

an average of 2.5 ± 0.1% GFP-positive cells (mean ± s.e.m.) following 24 hours’ incubation with

165

pseudovirus and 0.1% DMSO vehicle control (Figure 4A) with no major changes in number of

8

166

cell nuclei relative to uninfected cells (Figure 4B). Additionally, no major changes in total cell

167

nuclei were observed in the presence of up to 50 μM of any compound, indicating no overt

168

effects on cell viability, with the exception of 50 μM resveratrol which resulted in cultures with

169

60.3 ± 7.0% of nuclei observed in untreated, infected cells (Figure 4B).

170

However, when Vero-E6 cells were infected with pseudovirus in the presence of 50 μM

171

hopeaphenol, GFP fluorescence was present in only 28.4 ± 2.1% of infected cells treated with

172

0.1% DMSO (Figure 4A, C). Similar results were observed when infected cells were co-treated

173

with 50 μM vatalbinoside A, where 38.5 ± 14.8% of GFP-positive cells were observed relative to

174

infected, vehicle-treated cells (Figure 4C). In contrast, 50 μM vaticanol B resulted in GFP

175

expression in 84.8 ± 9.7% of cells, indicating that the potent anti-RBD/ACE2 activity observed

176

by AlphaScreen assay was not reproduced in the pseudotype assay. As expected, 50 μM

177

resveratrol had no effect on GFP-positive cells (96.4 ± 13.3% GFP expression of infected,

178

vehicle-treated cells; Figure 4C). However, no compound inhibited GFP expression when

179

incubated with infected cells at 15 μM (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate

180

that at least a subset of stilbenoids can inhibit entry of pseudoviruses expressing SARS-CoV-2

181

spike protein in vitro, consistent with AlphaScreen assay results, although this occurs at much

182

higher concentrations.

183
184

Stilbenoids inhibit infectious SARS-CoV-2 replication

185

To confirm cellular antiviral activity of hopeaphenol and analogues, we next used a

186

cytopathic effect (CPE)-based assay with infectious virus in Vero-E6 cells (25-26). Briefly,

187

Vero-E6 cells were treated with compounds for 2 hours in 8-fold replicates in 96-well format

188

before infection with 50x median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of SARS-CoV-2

189

(USA-WA1/2020 variant). Cells were then incubated for 4 days with daily scoring of CPE across

190

all wells by a user blinded to experimental conditions. Using this approach, we observed the

191

presence of CPE by 2 days post infection, as characterized by extensive cell rounding and

192

cellular debris that were observable by light microscopy (Figure 5A, arrows). By 4 days post-

193

infection, this CPE was widespread across the cell culture and clearly distinguishable from

194

uninfected cell controls (Figure 5A). When low micromolar concentrations of either the control

195

nucleoside analog remdesivir or the Mpro inhibitor GC-376 (27-28) were added 2 hours before

196

infection, CPE was completely inhibited in these cultures after 4 days (Figure 5B, top and

197

middle), with calculated EC50s of 2.5 and 3.9 μM for remdesivir and GC-376, respectively

198

(Figure 5C; Table 1). Moreover, comparable activity was observed in the presence of

199

hopeaphenol (Figure 5B, bottom), which blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication after 4 days with a

200

calculated EC50 of 10.2 μM (Figure 5C; Table 1). Notably, while similar antiviral activity was

201

observed with vatalbinoside A (EC50 = 13.8 μM), we observed substantially less efficacy by

202

vaticanol B (EC50 = 37.0 μM; Figure 5C; Table 1), consistent with its reduced efficacy in

203

pseudovirus assays (Figure 4C). In contrast, no antiviral activity was observed by up to 100 μM

204

resveratrol (Figure 5C). We also observed no evidence of cytotoxicity by these compounds, as

205

measured by resazurin staining following 4 days treatment of uninfected Vero-E6 cells (Figure

206

5D). These results indicate that hopeaphenol and vatalbinoside A, and to a lesser extent vaticanol

207

B, inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro, with efficacy of hopeaphenol at the same order of

208

magnitude as control SARS-CoV-2 antivirals remdesivir and GC-376.

209
210

(–)-Hopeaphenol inhibits SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with improved efficacy against

211

B.1.351.

212

To determine if hopeaphenol maintained activity against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants

213

with accumulated mutations in the spike RBD, we repeated the CPE assay using two SARS-

214

CoV-2 variants of concern including B.1.1.7 (England/204820464/2020; “UK variant”) and

215

B.1.351 (KRISP-K005325/2020; “South Africa variant”) (Figure 6). Similar to our previous

216

observations, infection of Vero-E6 cells with either strain resulted in widespread CPE across

217

cultures after 4 days (Figure 6A, top), which was completely abolished by pre-treatment with 3

218

μM remdesivir (Figure 6A, middle). We also observed dose-dependent inhibition of these two

219

variants by remdesivir, with calculated EC50s of 1.5 and 1.4 μM for B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 strains,

220

respectively (Figure 6B), which also approximated observations with USA-WA1/2020 virus

221

(EC50 = 2.5 μM; Table 1). Notably, 15 μM hopeaphenol also completely abrogated CPE by both

222

variants (Figure 6A, bottom). When assessed for dose-response profiles, we observed that

223

B.1.1.7 was inhibited by hopeaphenol with an EC50 of 14.8 μM (Figure 6C), which

224

approximated hopeaphenol’s efficacy against USA-WA1/2020 (IC50 = 10.2 μM; Table 1). In

225

contrast, B.1.351 was inhibited by hopeaphenol with an IC50 of 2.3 μM (Figure 6C), indicating

226

4.5-fold improved efficacy over USA-WA1/2020 (Table 1).

227

To confirm that the antiviral activities of hopephanol against these variants of concern

228

corresponded to inhibition of viral entry, we generated VSVΔG-S-GFP-based pseudoviruses

229

containing B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 spike sequences and infected Vero-E6 cells in the absence or

230

presence of 50 μM hopeaphenol (Figure 7). Similar to previous observations (Figure 4B), no

231

major changes in total cell nuclei number were observed under any experimental condition (data

232

not shown). Also broadly consistent with previous observations with our original pseudovirus,

233

we observed an average of 8.2 ± 2.9 and 6.0 ± 0.5% GFP-positive cells following 24 hours’

234

incubation with pseudovirus containing B.1.1.7 or B.1.351 spike, respectively (Figure 7A, top).

235

Furthermore, infection of both pseudoviruses continued to be inhibited by 50 μM hopeaphenol

236

(Figure 7A, bottom). For example, pseudovirus containing B.1.1.7 spike was observed in only

237

22.9 ± 7.6% of cells relative to infected, vehicle-treated cells treated with 0.1% DMSO (Figure

238

7B), similar to results from pseudovirus plus USA-WA1/2020 spike (28.4 ± 2.1%). In contrast,

239

pseudovirus containing B.1.351 spike was present in only 15.3 ± 1.3% of infected, vehicle-

240

treated cells when compared to infected cells without 50 μM hopeaphenol treatment (Figure

241

7B), indicating a 1.9-fold improved efficacy over USA-WA1/2020 spike-containing pseudovirus.

242

Taken together, these results indicate that hopeaphenol inhibits both replication of

243

infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in vitro and entry of pseudoviruses containing

244

divergent SARS-CoV-2 spike sequences as well as improved efficacy against the B.1.351

245

variant.

Discussion

248

Antivirals that act across multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants are needed worldwide to

249

supplement emerging vaccine efforts. Here we investigated a library of pure compounds derived

250

from 512 pure natural products and derivatives and identified three stilbenoids, exemplified by (–

251

viral entry of spike-containing pseudoviruses, and antagonize infectious SARS-CoV-2

replication without cytotoxicity in vitro. Importantly, hopeaphenol also inhibits two emerging

254

variants of concern (B.1.1.7 and B.1.351) which have acquired sequence variations that enhance

255

SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and/or promote reduced susceptibility or escape from neutralizing

antibodies. Hopeaphenol and other stilbenoid analogues are therefore promising leads for

257

developing broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors, potentially for use as monotherapies

258

or in combination with antiviral leads against other viral targets.

259

(–)-Hopeaphenol, vatalbinoside A, vaticanol B, and related stilbenoids and their

260

stereoisomers have been isolated from a variety of plant sources including Hopea, Vitis, Shorea,

261

Anisoptera, and Vatica species, among others (29-37). These compounds have been reported to

262

exhibit several in vitro properties including antiproliferative (32-33, 37-38), antibacterial

263

(through inhibition of the type III secretion system of Gram-negative bacteria) (30, 39),

264

antifungal (40), anti-influenza and herpes simplex virus (41-42), and anti-inflammatory (34, 43)

265

activities, among others. Notably, hopeaphenol is additionally reported to inhibit plasma

266

triglyceride elevation in olive oil-treated mice and reduce plasma glucose in sucrose-loaded mice

267

at 200 mg/kg (44-45). It also exhibited hepatoprotective effects against LPS-induced liver injury

268

in mice at 100 mg/kg (34). These initial in vivo efficacy studies, which indicate tolerability at

269

high concentrations, support near-term in vivo studies of anti-SARS-CoV-2 efficacy by (–)-

270

hopeaphenol.

271

More recently, stilbenoids have been proposed as potential disruptors of SARS-CoV-2

272

spike protein with ACE2 in molecular docking studies (46). Another stilbenoid, kobophenol A,

273

was also recently reported to inhibit binding of RBD with ACE2 (IC50 = 1.8 μM) and SARS-

274

CoV-2 replication (EC50 = 71.6 μM) (47), and our data are consistent with these observations.

275

However, we observed no antiviral activity by resveratrol at up to 100 μM, which contrasts with

276

another recent study reporting an EC50 of 10.7 μM in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero-E6 cells

277

(BetaCov isolate) (48). However, this latter study measured supernatant viral RNA levels by

278

quantitative PCR after 48 hours’ infection, and so disparate results could reflect differences in

279

sensitivity between quantitative PCR and CPE-based assays. Another consideration is that the

13

280

three hit stilbenoid compounds, as polyphenolics, represent a structure class that has been given a

281

PAINS (Pan Assay Interference compoundS) designation (49). Although we observed that these

282

compounds selectively disrupted RBD/ACE2 binding over an unrelated PD-1/PD-L1

283

ligand/receptor pair, for example with 257.3-fold selectivity for hopeaphenol, caution must still

284

be taken when considering these compounds for further therapeutic development. However,

285

generation or isolation of stilbenoid analogues with potentially improved selectivity as well as

286

assessment of chemical leads in primary cell models remain warranted.

287

While the three stilbenoids identified here selectively disrupted RBD/ACE2 interactions

288

at sub-micromolar concentrations over an unrelated PD-1/PD-L1 ligand/receptor pair, and we

289

observed efficacy at low micromolar concentrations in CPE assays, inhibitory activity against

290

spike-containing pseudoviruses occurred only at 50 μM. These observations could partially

291

reflect reduced stability of these stilbenoids in vitro and/or reduced efficacy against VSV-

292

backbone pseudoviruses in particular. Stilbenoids are also sensitive to oxidation due to the

293

presence of the phenolic moieties and their ability to delocalize an unpaired electron (50) They

294

are also unstable to factors including oxygen, heat, light and pH changes (51-52). Consistent

295

with the potential for reduced stability, vaticanol B, while consistently the most potent disruptor

296

of RBD/ACE2 interactions by AlphaScreen, was ~3-fold less effective than hopeaphenol and

297

vatalbinoside A in both pseudovirus and CPE assays (Table 1). Assessment of additional

298

analogues and derivatives may also mitigate this concern.

299

A recent report also describes use of a virtual screening approach which identified

300

hopeaphenol as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by interacting within its active site

301

(18). In contrast, we observed only weak inhibitory activity of hopeaphenol and analogues

302

against Mpro (e.g., IC50s = ~40 – 70 μM, compared to 0.0052 μM for GC-376; Table 1). While

14

303

our studies do not rule out modest inhibition of Mpro by hopeaphenol, this activity is unlikely to

304

confer the primary antiviral activity observed in vitro (e.g. hopeaphenol EC50s = 2.3 – 10.2 μM

305

in CPE assays; Table 1). Support for this hypothesis also comes from our observations that

306

hopeaphenol has similarly improved activity against the B.1.351 variant in both CPE and

307

pseudovirus assays, indicating that hopeaphenol’s efficacy is dependent on spike sequence.

308

Nevertheless, these combined results do raise the intriguing possibility of identifying stilbenoid

309

derivatives that target both SARS-CoV-2 entry and Mpro, which in turn may improve antiviral

310

efficacy and/or reduce the risk of eventual viral drug resistance.

311

There are currently no licensed antivirals that reliably protect against COVID-19. Recent

312

reports of SARS-CoV-2 variants with accumulated spike mutations and reduced susceptibility or

313

escape from neutralizing sera from convalescent and vaccine-treated patients (7-8) also raise the

314

concern of emerging variants with resistance to existing vaccines. In contrast, we observe that

315

hopeaphenol, despite acting as an inhibitor of spike-mediated viral entry, inhibits CPE of both an

316

early SARS-CoV-2 isolate (USA-WA1/2020) as well as two recently emerging variants of

317

concern (B.1.1.7 and B.1.351), with improved efficacy against the antibody escape variant

318

B.1.351. These results suggest that spike mutations that promote vaccine-induced viral escape

319

may be distinct from those that might arise from ongoing treatment with hopeaphenol and

320

potentially other stilbenoid-based entry inhibitors. Although further studies are clearly needed,

321

this possibility, in turn, raises the possibility of natural product-based entry inhibitors that

322

function as effective antiviral countermeasures in the absence of available second-generation

323

vaccines.

Chemical libraries and hit compounds
The Davis Open Access Natural Product-Based Library consists of 512 distinct

328

compounds, the majority (53%) of which are natural products obtained primarily from Australian

329

fungal, plant, and marine invertebrate sources (11-12), as well as semi-synthetic natural product

330

analogues (28%) and known commercial drugs or synthetic compounds inspired by natural

331

products (19%). All compounds evaluated in this study were analyzed for purity prior to testing

332

and shown to be > 95% pure. Compounds were initially provided by Compounds Australia at

333

Griffith University in 5 mM stock solutions dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Millipore,

334

Burlington, MA, USA); as such, DMSO was used as the vehicle control in this study. The three

335

hit compounds identified following library screening, which are all known stilbenoids (30), were

336

re-supplied as dry powders for confirmation studies and further biological evaluation.

Protein-protein interaction assays

357

SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD binding to ACE2 was determined using AlphaScreen

358

technology. 2 nM of ACE2-Fc (Sino Biological, Chesterbrook, PA, USA) was incubated with 5

359

nM HIS-tagged SARS-CoV-2 Spike-RBD (Sino Biological) in the presence of 5 μg/mL nickel

360

chelate donor bead in a total of 10 μL of 20 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mM KCl, and 0.05% CHAPS

361

in white, opaque, low-volume 384-well plates. Test compounds were diluted to 100x final

362

concentration in 100% DMSO. 5 μL of ACE2-Fc/Protein A acceptor bead was first added to the

363

plate, followed by 100 nL of test compounds and then 5 μL of CoV-Spike-RBD-HIS/Nickel

364

chelate donor beads. Test compounds were added to each well using a Janus Nanohead

365

(PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). For each experiment, all conditions were performed in

366

duplicate. Following 2 h incubation at room temperature, AlphaScreen fluorescent signals were

367

measured using a ClarioStar plate reader (BMG Labtech, Cary, NC, USA). Data were

368

normalized to percent inhibition, where 100% equaled the AlphaScreen signal in the absence of

369

SARS-CoV-2-Spike-RBD-His and 0% equaled AlphaScreen signal in the presence of both

370

proteins and DMSO alone.

371

PD-1 binding to PD-L1 was also determined using AlphaScreen technology. 0.5 nM of

372

human PD-L1-Fc (Sino Biological) was incubated with 5 nM HIS-tagged human PD-1 (Sino

373

Biological) in the presence of 5 μg/mL protein A AlphaScreen acceptor bead and 5 μg/mL nickel

374

chelate donor bead in a total volume of 10 μL of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, and

375

0.005% Tween in white, opaque low-volume 384-well plates. 5 μL of PD-L1-Fc/protein A

376

acceptor bead was first added to the plate, followed by 100 nL of test compound prepared as

377

described above, followed by 5 μL of PD-1-His/nickel chelate donor bead. For each experiment,

378

all conditions were performed in duplicate. Following 2 h incubation at room temperature, data

379

were collected as described above and normalized to percent inhibition, where 100% equaled the

Generation of Mpro protein
The codon-optimized gene for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (or 3CLpro) (GenBank: QHD43415.1

385

aa 3264-3567) from strain BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 was ordered from IDT (Coralville, IA,

386

USA) and cloned into a HIS-SUMO expression vector (a modified pET-DUET; Novagen,

387

Madison, WI, USA). After transformation into BL21(DE3), the HIS-SUMO-Mpro fusion protein

388

was expressed using the autoinduction method (53) with 500 mL cultures at 22 °C overnight.

389

Cell pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris pH 8.5, 20 mM imidazole 200

390

mM NaCl, 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol and lysed using sonication and lysozyme and centrifuged at

391

high speed. The supernatant was applied to a Ni-NTA (nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid) column at 4

392

°C and washed with the resuspension buffer. The fusion protein was then eluted using a buffer

393

300 mM imidazole, 200 mM NaCl and 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol, concentrated and applied to a

gel filtration column (HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75; Cytiva, Marlborough, MA) and equilibrated

395

with the resuspension buffer. Fractions with > 90% purity were pooled and incubated with

396

SUMO protease at 4 °C overnight. After cleavage, the digested protein solution was applied

397

twice to a 5 mL HIS-TRAP Ni-NTA column (Cytiva) to remove the HIS-SUMO and SUMO

398

protease, and the flow-through was collected. Finally, the protein was concentrated and applied

399

to a second gel filtration column (HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 75; Cytiva) equilibrated with 25 mM

400

HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM TCEP. Purity (> 95%) was confirmed using an SDS-

Mpro enzymatic assays
Protease activity of recombinant Mpro was measured using the quenched fluorogenic

405

substrate {DABCYL}-Lys-Thr- Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-Ser-Gly-Phe-Arg-Lys-Met-Glu-

406

(EDANS)-NH2 (Bachem, Vista, CA, USA). 5 μL of 25 nM Mpro diluted in assay buffer [25 mM

407

HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 0.005% Tween) was dispensed into black, low-

408

volume 384-well plates. Test compounds were serially diluted into 100% DMSO, and 0.1 μL

409

was added to the assay using a Janus MDT Nanohead (PerkinElmer). Assays were initiated by

410

addition of 5 μL of 5 μM fluorogenic substrate, and fluorescence at 355 nm excitation and 460

411

nm emission was monitored every 5 minutes for 50 minutes using an Envision plate reader

412

(PerkinElmer). Rate of substrate cleavage was determined using linear regression of the raw data

413

values obtained during the time course. Slopes of these progress curves were then normalized to

414

percent inhibition, where 100% equaled rate in the absence of Mpro (which was typically 0), and

415

0% equaled rate of cleavage in the presence of Mpro and 0.1% DMSO.

Generation of VSVΔG-S-GFP pseudoviruses
SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 cDNA was obtained as a gift from Dr. Stephen J.

419

Elledge. B.1.1.7 spike cDNA was generated from USA-WA1/2020 spike cDNA by standard

420

PCR mutagenesis, and B.1.351 spike cDNA was synthesized (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ, USA).

421

Pseudoviruses were generated in BHK-21/WI-2 cells using a pseudotyped ΔG-GFP (G*ΔG-

422

GFP) rVSV (Kerafast, Boston, MA, USA) in addition to spike sequences cloned into the paT7-

423

Spike plasmid as described previously (21). 2 hours following chemical transfection of spike

424

plasmid, cells were infected with ΔG-GFP (G*ΔG-GFP) rVSV. Following 24 hours incubation,

425

supernatants were harvested, aliquoted, and stored at -80 °C.

426
427

Pseudovirus-based infectivity assays

428

12,500 Vero-E6 cells resuspended 12.5 μL D10+ were plated in 384 μL plates, followed

429

by addition of 6.25 μL of test agents diluted in D10+ at 4X desired final concentration plus 6.25

430

μL of undiluted pseudovirus stock (total 25 μL reaction volumes). All experimental conditions

431

with test agents were performed in duplicate, and control cells with or without pseudovirus in the

432

presence of 0.1% DMSO vehicle control were tested 4-fold. Cells were incubated at 37 °C and

433

5% CO2 for 24 hours. Cells were then stained with 25 μL of 5 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 (Sigma

434

Aldrich), incubated for 20 minutes, and fixed with paraformaldehyde to 2% final concentration.

435

High content imaging was then performed using a Nikon Eclipse Ti Inverted Microscope and

436

Nikon NIS Elements AR Software Version 5.30.02 (Nikon Americas Inc., Melville, NY, USA).

437

For each image, cell nuclei and GFP-positive cells were counted, with GFP positive cells

438

reported as percent of total nuclei within each image.

Resazurin cell viability assay
20,000 Vero-E6 cells were plated in 96-well plates and incubated overnight before

442

addition of compounds at defined concentrations. 0.1% DMSO vehicle control was added to

443

wells in the absence of test compounds. All experimental conditions were performed in

444

duplicate. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4 days before addition of resazurin

445

(Sigma Aldrich) to a final concentration of 20 μg/mL. Cells were incubated for an additional 4

446

hours before fluorescence intensity was measured using a ClarioStar plate reader (BMG

Generation of SARS-CoV-2 viruses
3 x 106 Vero-E6 cells were incubated in 15 mL of D10+ media for 24 hours. Cells were

452

then washed and replaced with 10 mL of D10+ containing virus at a multiplicity of infection

453

MOI of 0.001. Cells were incubated for 5 – 7 days until clear CPE was observed throughout the

454

flask. Media was harvested and split into 250 μL aliquots for storage at -80 °C.

455

To titer virus stocks, Vero-E6 cells were first plated to 20,000 cells per well in 96-well

456

format in D10+ media and incubated for 24 hours. Following incubation, cells were incubated in

457

fresh D10+ containing 5-fold serial dilutions of a thawed virus aliquot (8 total dilutions, 5-fold

458

replicates) and incubated for an additional 4 days. Wells were then scored for the presence of
