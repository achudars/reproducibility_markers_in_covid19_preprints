Abstract
In January of 2020, COVID-19 became a worldwide pandemic. As many industries shutdown to
comply with social distancing measures, the cannabis industry was deemed an essential business
in most U.S. jurisdictions. Cannabis is manually farmed, trimmed and packaged. Employees and
trimmers in cannabis grows have been reported to test qPCR positive for SARs-CoV-2 and as a
result cannabis flower can be a potential inhaled SARs-CoV-2 fomite. Many of the comorbidities
described in COVID-19 are also qualifying conditions for medical cannabis access. Bat guano
has been identified as a rich source for novel coronavirus discovery and it is also a common
fertilizer in the cannabis field. To better assess cannabis fomite risk we developed a SARs-CoV2 quantitative PCR assay optimized to operate with a hemp flower background matrix. This
assay was utilized to estimate the stability of gamma irradiated SARs-CoV-2 as a hemp flower
fomite.
Introduction
A HIV pandemic altered the landscape of medical cannabis legislation in California in 1996.
Dennis Peron (a medical cannabis and HIV activist) authored Proposition 215 (The
Compassionate Use Act) which legalized medical cannabis in California. Twenty years later, in
2016, Cannabis was still federally illegal in all states. Colorado, Washington and many other
states have since legalized recreational use at the state level. In many ways, viruses like HIV,
proliferated the medical cannabis initiatives and while these laws have been successful for many
patients it is not without side effects.
The cannabis industry recently experienced a respiratory illness. E-cigarette vaping associated
lung injury (EVALI) presented itself in 2019 as a “vape pen” related illness believed to be
associated with Vitamin E Acetate, commonly used as a solvent for some clandestine
vaporization pens (Bhat et al. 2020; Lal et al. 2020). The epidemic also involved a lower
percentage of nicotine pens. 78% of patients were using untested black-market pens, some
sourced from China (Control 2020). This disease resulted in 2,807 hospitalizations and 68
fatalities and began to tail off in November of 2019 just as the COVID-19 epidemic was
beginning to spread. This disease, while not believed to be contagious, shares symptomatology
with COVID-19. Respiratory stress, pneumonia and abnormal ground-glass opacities in chest CT
scans are common in both diseases and it is unknown to what extent these diseases exacerbate
each other (Henry et al. 2019).
In 2020, Cannabis dispensaries are finding themselves to be in an unexpected class of “essential”
businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is presumably due to the high number of
patients served by cannabis dispensaries and the increased demand on scarce pandemic hospital
capacity that could occur with a cannabis dispensary shutdown.
Annual cannabis use varies by country and is estimated to be over 15% in the United States as of
2017 (Breckenridge et al. 2019). Use rates have climbed since legalization most notably in the
older population (Han and Palamar 2018). States that have medical cannabis access have shown

decreased Medicare expenditure and decreased opiate overdoses (Bachhuber et al. 2014;
Bradford and Bradford 2016a; Bradford and Bradford 2016b; Bradford and Bradford 2017;
Bachhuber et al. 2018a; Bachhuber et al. 2018b; Wing et al. 2020).
86%-99% of COVID-19 deaths are comorbid with diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disorder (COPD), and cancer (Franki 2020; Guan et al. 2020). Many cannabis
patients are treating these conditions directly or palliatively with cannabinoids (Pratt et al. 2019).
While few states list all of these conditions as approved medical conditions for cannabinoids,
many patients point to anecdotal cases of cannabinoid use for cancer and HIV symptom relief. A
double-blind placebo controlled trial exists for cannabinoids and diabetes (Jadoon et al. 2016)
and a randomized placebo controlled trial for HIV-associated sensory neuropathy (Abrams et al.
2007). Various other studies exist for cannabinoid use in many autoimmune and reactive oxygen
species (ROS) related diseases (Russo 2018; Hill 2020). Cannabinoid use is also common in
febrile epilepsy and has sparked concern with COVID-19 as it is unclear if cannabinoids will
dull the immune response or limit cytokine storms.
Many of the complications of COVID-19 include cytokine storms, clots and strokes. There is
preliminary evidence for the endocannabinoid system’s involvement in these conditions, but
there are no double blind placebo controlled trials to guide any prescriptive use (Klein et al.
2000; Coetzee et al. 2007; Nagarkatti et al. 2009; Choi et al. 2019). The antiviral properties of
cannabinoids have been studied in other RNA viruses like HCV; however, there is currently no
data to support COVID-19 treatment with cannabinoids (Lowe et al. 2017). A few cannabis
derived compounds (CannabisinA and Quercetin) have been computationally predicted to be
potent SARs-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors, but these compounds are not currently tracked or
quantitated in cannabis flower and no in-vitro data exists for these molecules applied to SARsCoV-2 (Ngo 2020). Byrareddy et. al. suggest Cannabinoids could be used to reduced lung
inflammation in SARs-CoV-2 patients (Byrareddy and Mohan 2020) and Wang et al report some
cannabinoid extracts modulating ACE2 expression in COVID-19 gateway tissues (Wang 2020),
but these are also preliminary findings and require further exploration to understand prescriptive
use.
Comorbid COVID-19 patients are also prone to secondary infections from Aspergillus fumigatus,
Aspergillus flavus, Candida glabrata, Candida albicans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus
aureus (Blaize et al. 2020; Chen et al. 2020; Duployez et al. 2020; Huttner et al. 2020; Koehler et
al. 2020). Fifty percent of COVID patients die with secondary infections (Zhou et al. 2020).
Many of these pathogens are cannabis endophytes or epiphytes and are the targets of existing
cannabis testing regulation (Feeney and Punja 2015; McKernan et al. 2015; McKernan et al.
2016; Thompson et al. 2017; Punja et al. 2019; Vujanovic et al. 2020). The primary infection of
SARs-CoV-2 is currently not being screened for in the cannabis supply chain.
In 2020, Cannabis growers also began to report employees testing positive for SARs-CoV-2
(Adams 2020). Concurrently, novel coronaviruses are being discovered in bat guano, a fertilizer
commonly used in the cannabis industry (Valitutto et al. 2020). Given cannabis flower is an
inhaled product that requires manual contact to grow and trim, we developed tools to detect
SARs-CoV-2 RNA within the background cannabis matrix. We describe a modified CDC/EUA
based quantitative PCR assay for detection of SARs-CoV-2 RNA that contains an additional

cannabis internal control amplicon. This amplicon helps to address false negatives and false
positives that might arise due to the complex cannabis flower matrix.
With prevalent cannabis use and surges in cannabis sales during lockdowns, it is safe to assume
that Cannabinoid use and COVID-19 will intersect. There is no evidence to suggest cannabis is a
replicative host for SARs-CoV-2, and the cannabis lighting and curing process may sterilize the
plant from becoming a productive fomite; however, human contact, sneezing or even breathing
after curing may still present elevated fomite risk for oral or vaporized routes of administration
(Judson et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020; Rubens et al. 2020).
Studies investigating the viability of SARs-CoV-2 on various surfaces and indoor environments
imply stability on certain surfaces for up to 7 days (van Doremalen et al. 2020). These studies
utilized 1 million - 100,000 copies tissue-culture infectious dose [TCID50] per milliliter and
witnessed a greater reduction in viability on copper surfaces than plastic surfaces. It is important
to note that the viability dropped 3 orders of magnitude in 72 hours on plastic. It is unknown if
dried cannabis (rich in antioxidants, 10-20% by weight THCA and CBDA) is more or less stable
as a fomite, but the plastic cannabis is often stored in ranks as one of the more stable fomites.
To address fomite stability, gamma irradiated virus was inoculated into hemp flower and
extracted and quantitated with qPCR across 7 days (Figure 12.)
Given this intersection, we believe it is imperative and preemptive to survey the cannabis supply
chain for SARs-CoV-2 RNA to prevent other modes of disease transmission. Given the
unexpected “essential” classification of cannabis dispensaries, we believe it is better to be
proactive rather than reactive to potential risks that could change this status abruptly.
Methods
We describe a single tube (Eppendorf) and 96 well plate format for processing samples. The 96
well method samples 5-fold less homogenate than the Eppendorf method due to volume
restrictions on the 96 well plate (200 μL). This results in lower sensitivity for higher throughput
methods but this smaller sampling volume can be compensated for by increasing the volume of
the qPCR reaction or it can be addressed by using purifications of multiple 96 well preparations.
DNA Purification
1-gram of USDA compliant (<0.3% (THC + 0.87 * THCA)) hemp flower (Spartan Hempworks,
Massachusetts) is homogenized in 14.2mL of Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) in a Nasco Whirlpak bag.
1mL of homogenate is removed and lysed with 50 μL MGC lysis buffer (Figure 1). This lysis
buffer is known to effectively lyse open M13 Phage (Hawkins et al. 1997). Samples are vortexed
and briefly spun with a table-top centrifuge. SARs-CoV-2 positive control DNA (IDT) was
spiked in at various dilutions (200,000 copies, 20,000 copies, 2,000 copies, 200 copies).
96 well format
200 μL of lysate is purified using MGC nucleic acid SenSATIVAx purification system (SKU420001). Samples are eluted in 25 μL of ddH20 and 8 μL of DNA is utilized in qPCR.

Eppendorf format:
1 mL of homogenate is removed from the WhirlPak bag from the back side of the 300 um mesh
filter and placed into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. 50 μL of MGC lysis buffer is added, vortexed
briefly and spun down in a benchtop microcentrifuge (Figure 2). The supernatant is aspirated and
placed into two separate Eppendorf tubes and 500 μL of MGC binding buffer is added, vortexed,
incubated for 5 minutes and magnetically separated using a Magnetic Separation Rack (NEB
#S1509S). Three 1 mL 70% ethanol washes are performed on the Eppendorf tubes. The resulting
beads are dried for 20 minutes at RT and eluted in 25 μL ddH20 with a brief vortex. The 25 μL
are combined into a single tube free of magnetic beads. For higher sensitivity, 21.5 μL of this
eluent can be used in a 50 μL qPCR reaction.
Each format offers different throughput and different sampling. 20-100% of the 1 mL lysate is
purified (96 well vs Eppendorf tubes). 96 well format is eluting in 25ul and utilizing 8.6ul in
qPCR. This is results in 34% of the purified volume being placed into qPCR. 20% of the
homogenate with 34% of the DNA sampled in qPCR results in 6.8% of the total 1 mL being
assayed. This format offers lower sensitivity but higher throughput.
The Eppendorf format purifies the full 1 mL and utilizes up to 40% of the DNA with a 50 μL
qPCR reaction. This approach is less automation friendly but offers over 6X higher sensitivity.
Simply purifying more 96 wells per sample could increase the total homogenate volume assayed
while still affording automated magnetic separation and washing. Variations of these two
methods may find a more optimal compromise of cost, sensitivity and throughput. Failure to dry
all of the ethanol out of the larger extractions can lead to failures that will be evident by the delay
or lack of hemp internal control signal. Homogenized hemp samples usually produce 22-25 Cq.
RNase viability proxy assay
Infectious SARs-CoV-2 must be handled in a bio-level 3 containment facility. SARs-CoV-2
DNA and RNA can be handled in bio-level 1 facilities and gamma irradiated virus requires biolevel 2 facilities. This places constraints on measuring viral “viability” that is traditionally
assayed by counting plaques on Vero cell lawns. To estimate this without utilizing live cultures
that replicate the virus, we emulated a live-dead assay from the microbial testing field that
utilizes DNase to digest free circulating DNA while leaving genomic DNA inside a cell
membrane intact (Medicinal Genomics part #420145). We hypothesized that RNases could
achieve the same result with SARs-CoV-2 as RNase A shouldn’t traverse the nuclease protective
envelope protein and only digest uncoated viral RNA.
To assay this, 100 μL of TSB cannabis homogenate is aspirated and split into 50 μL RNase
negative and 50 μL RNase positive fractions. 4 μL of 20 mg/mL RNase A (New England
Biolabs #T3018L) is added to the RNase positive aliquot of non-lysed TSB from 1-gram
cannabis flower homogenate. The digestion is held at 37 °C for 30 minutes. Samples are purified
using 50 μL of SenSATIVAx, magnetic separation, three 70% ethanol washes, and eluted in 25
μL ul of ddH20 and 2 μL of RNase blocker. Both RNase + and RNase- samples are compared in
qPCR.

Results
DNA purification of cannabis homogenate (Figure 1) was explored in 96 well and single tube
(1.5 mL Eppendorf) format (Figure 2 and 3). The N2 amplicons multiplexed with Cannabis
internal control amplicons showed linearity from 500,000 copies down to 5 copies with SARsCoV-2 DNA positive controls (Figure 4). The addition of the cannabis internal control assists in
identifying DNA purification or sampling related false negatives (Figure 5,6). When assayed in
the presence of subsampled hemp background this sensitivity decays from 5 copies to 50 copies
(Figure 7,8) presumably due to competition with the multiplexed internal control. The N2
amplicon performs better than N1 amplicon (data not shown) with the added multiplexed internal
control. Gradient qPCR and altered primer concentrations were explored to rescue the
multiplexed N1-internal hemp control amplicon without success. Assay robustness was explored
with varying lysis buffer concentrations (Figure 9) to ensure full lysis of the virus.

Two additional SARs-CoV-2 positive controls were tested. A RNA whole genome control and a
gamma irradiated attenuated virus were tested (ATCC-1986D & BEI Resources- 52267) (Figure
10). The gamma irradiated reagent was deposited by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and was obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: SARS-Related Coronavirus
2, Isolate USA-WA1/2020, Gamma-Irradiated, NR-52287. Both controls showed equivalent
amplification to plasmid DNA based controls and the lysis buffer was confirmed to be effective
at lysing SARs-CoV-2 virus particles.
The assay sensitivity in cannabis matrix is affected by subsampling. One seventh to one tenth of
the homogenate is purified (10-14 mL homogenate) and 30%-40% of the purified DNA is
assayed in qPCR without the use of an enrichment step. This is equivalent to FDA approved
assay from Roche on nasopharyngeal swabs where 1/5th of the homogenate (0.2 mL/1 mL)is
purified and 25% of the DNA assayed in qPCR (Diagnostic 2020).
In most jurisdictions a 1-gram sample of dried cannabis flower is required for pathogen testing. It
is difficult to homogenize the entire 1-gram volume of cannabis (Figure 11) into a PCR assay.
The 10 mL to 14.2 mL volumes assayed for cannabis are much larger than the 1 mL
nasopharyngeal swabs used in human SARs-CoV-2 testing. DNA purification that elutes in a
smaller volume than the homogenate concentrates the sample and can compensate for some of
these expanded volumes required for cannabis sampling. Likewise, viral enrichment may
overcome the sampling bias, but viral enrichment requires culturing the virus in the presence of
Vero cells (BL3) and may not be advised given the risk to the testing lab employees (Colson et
al. 2020; La Scola et al. 2020). Differential centrifugation techniques or antibody enrichment
may improve virion sampling, but these may require itemization of packaged versus inactive
RNA with RNase A as described.
Gamma-irradiated SARs-CoV-2 is stable on non-sterile cannabis flowers for at least 7 days with
the inoculations used in this study (Figure 12). The Cq shift from Day 0 to Day 7 represents a
120 fold decrease in RNA. This study only evaluated irradiated virus. Further work (BL3) is
required to assess infectious versus non-infectious virus on cannabis. Hemp microbial
regulations in the US are less stringent than medical cannabis microbial regulations. The high
background total aerobic count on these samples may alter viability of the virus and should be
repeated with samples sterilized more aggressively for medical cannabis use. Gamma-irradiated
virus may have a shorter shelf life than infective virus and the infectability of gamma-irradiated
virus is intentionally attenuated.
To assess the “live-dead” status of the virus we RNase treated the viral RNA genome, viral DNA
genome, and the gamma-irradiated genome to ascertain if the gamma-irradiated viral RNA still
had protection from exogenous RNases (Figure 13). As expected, the RNase had no impact on
the gDNA but showed considerable decay in qPCR Cq of the gamma-irradiated virus suggesting
the viral envelop is not fully intact. The RNA genome was fully degraded suggesting the
gamma-irradiated virus has a minimal amount of RNase protected genome. A Cq to PFU
calibration with SARs-CoV-2 inoculated Vero cells (BL3 laboratory) is required to draw
conclusive estimates of viral infectability on cannabis.

Discussion
The infective dose of SARs-CoV-2 virus particles is not currently known; however, superspreader events are believed to present higher viral load and result in more patients that progress
to symptomatic disease (Wong et al. 2015). Aerosol and surface stability of SARs-CoV-2 has
been measured on various surfaces (Doremalen). These studies evaluated thousands to millions
of copies of the virus. Many described human SARs-CoV-2 LAMP and qPCR tests report
similar sensitivity in the 10-100 copy range (Lau et al. 2003; Bruce 2020; Park 2020; SchmidBurgk 2020). Digital PCR technologies have been proposed to enhance the sensitivity of qPCR
as the sampling approaches single molecule levels, but these methods add significant costs and
may not address the fundamental problems of low volume PCR reactions surveying and
subsampling larger volumes of biological fluids (Dong 2020).
One limitation to this study is the use of cured cannabis samples. The polymerase utilized in this
study has reverse transcriptase (RT) activity and will amplify both DNA and RNA. Non cured
samples are likely to have higher RNA levels which may favor amplification of the cannabis
internal control over the viral target. Experiments with DNAse treatment of these hemp samples
demonstrated major shifts (5-8 Cq shift) in Cq suggesting very little contribution from Cannabis
RNA but this may need further investigation for testing un-cured cannabis or different cannabis
tissues.
To date, SARs-CoV-2 has never been detected on cannabis and cannabis is not believed to be a
corona virus replicative host. It is possible for manually curated cannabis flower to become a
fomite. It is doubtful virions will survive extraction or pyrolysis of cannabis flower but
vaporization of cannabis flower and cannabis pre-rolls are documented microbial vectors
(Remington et al. 2015; Shapiro Bb Md et al. 2018). Sterilization of SARs-CoV-2 requires 65 °C
treatment for 30 minutes (ATCC part # 1986HK). Cannabis vaporization is usually performed
over 130 °C but with a few seconds of duration. It is not yet known if this process will properly
sterilize cannabis of SARs-CoV-2, but it has failed to sterilize cannabis of Aspergillus spores and
resulted in clinical cases of Cannabis derived aspergillosis.
While chances of cannabis supply chain contamination with SARs-CoV-2 are remote, the RNA
of the virus is stable on unsterilized cannabis flower for over 7 days and may inform personal
protective gear protocols or sterilization techniques to ensure a virus free production process. A
published SARs-CoV-2 surveillance method can greatly aid community preparedness and supply
chain management. The sensitivity of this test is in line with the sensitivities being reported in
nasopharyngeal swabs and other early SARs-CoV-2 amplification assays. More work is required
to validate this on larger sample numbers and more diverse cannabis cultivars. This study
evaluated DNA, RNA and gamma irradiated positive controls and primer sequences published in
most EUA approved kits. Since there is no current evidence of SARs-CoV-2 detected on
Cannabis, this study should not be interpreted as a justification to limit patient access to
cannabis. The current COVID epidemic is a reminder of the importance of pre-emptive testing
readiness and we believe these methods can contribute towards such goals.

Figure 4: Assay LOD without Hemp Matrix. 10-fold serial dilutions of SARs-CoV-2 plasmid
DNA (100,000, 10,000, 1,000, 100, 10, 5 copies of positive control). Lowest dilution equates to
80 copies in the original 1mL sample. The LOD of this assay is limited by sampling bias and
would benefit from an internal PCR control to ensure the DNA purification and sampling was
done correctly. As a result, we targeted a Cannabis DNA sequence that should amplify at higher
copy number in every sample.

(Blue/FAM) decays with 10-fold dilutions. This encouraged the reduction of the cannabis control
amplicon primer concentrations to achieve even amplification efficiencies at low target
