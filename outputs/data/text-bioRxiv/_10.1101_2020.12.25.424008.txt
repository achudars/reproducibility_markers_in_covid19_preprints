Within the last two decades, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses 1 and
2 (SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2) have caused two major outbreaks. For reasons yet to be
fully understood the COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been significantly more
widespread than the 2003 SARS epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-1, despite striking similarities between the two viruses. One of the most variable genes differentiating SARS-CoV-1
and SARS-CoV-2 is the S gene that encodes the spike glycoprotein. This protein mediates
a crucial step in the infection, i.e., host cell recognition and viral entry, which starts with
binding to the host cell angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein for both viruses.
Recent structural and functional studies have shed light on the differential binding behavior of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. In particular, cryogenic electron
microscopy (cryo-EM) studies show that ACE2 binding is preceded by a large-scale conformational change in the spike protein to expose the receptor binding domain (RBD) to its
binding partner. Unfortunately, these studies do not provide detailed information on the
dynamics of this activation process. Here, we have used an extensive set of unbiased and biased microsecond-timescale all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of SARS-CoV-1

and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein ectodomains in explicit solvent to determine the differential
behavior of spike protein activation in the two viruses. Our results based on nearly 50 microseconds of equilibrium and nonequilibrium MD simulations indicate that the active form
of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is considerably more stable than the active SARS-CoV-1
spike protein. Unlike the active SARS-CoV-2 spike, the active SARS-CoV-1 spike spontaneously undergoes a large-scale conformational transition to a pseudo-inactive state, which
occurs in part due to interactions between the N-terminal domain (NTD) and RBD that are
absent in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Steered MD (SMD) simulations indicate that the
energy barriers between active and inactive states are comparatively lower for the SARSCoV-1 spike protein. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the greater propensity of
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to remain in the active conformation contributes to the higher
transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV-1. These results strongly suggest that the differential binding behavior of the active SARS-CoV-1 and 2 spike proteins is
not merely due to differences in their RBDs as other domains of the spike protein such as
the NTD could play a crucial role in the effective binding process, which involves the prebinding activation. Therefore, our hypothesis predicts that mutations in regions such as the
NTD, which is not directly involved in binding, may lead to a change in the effective binding
behavior of the coronavirus.

Introduction

The etiological agent for the COVID-19 pandemic is SARS-CoV-2, a lineage B Betacoronavirus
that originated in China towards the end of 2019

1–5

. This coronavirus has continued to spread

across the world, with millions of confirmed cases and over a million deaths only within a year.
Studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is more easily transmissible between humans in comparison
to SARS-CoV-1 6–9 , another lineage B Betacoronavirus that caused the 2003 SARS epidemic 10–12 .
The differential transmissibility of SARS-CoV-1 and 2 may partially explain the difference in the
scale of the SARS epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, given the striking similarity
of the two viruses, the molecular-level explanation of their differential transmissibility is largely
missing and has an important implication in developing effective therapeutic agents and vaccines
for COVID-19 with long-term efficacy.

SARS-CoV-2 shares several highly conserved structural and functional features with SARSCoV-1 1, 13, 14 . The homotrimeric spike (S) glycoprotein is possibly the most important of these and
plays a definitive role in the viral infection process by mediating recognition of the host cell receptors 13, 15–17 . For this reason, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the primary target of several ongoing
structure-based drug and vaccine design studies 18–20 . The SARS-CoV-1 (CoV-1) and SARS-CoV2 (CoV-2) spike proteins have a high sequence identity of approximately 79% 1 . The receptorbinding domains (RBDs) of both spike proteins interact with the human angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor in order to commence the host-cell infection process 6, 16, 17, 21–25 . Studies have shown that several regions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are susceptible to mutations,

with the RBD being particularly vulnerable in this regard 26–29 . It is possible that therapeutic agents
targeting only the RBD-ACE2 interaction might eventually be rendered ineffective due to the appearance of novel mutant strains. Therefore, diversifying the hot spots of the protein being targeted
by therapeutics and vaccines is essential in increasing their long-term efficacy. The current study
provides a rational framework for such directions by systematically studying the differential behavior of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, highlighting significant regions of the
protein that are involved in the activation process of the prefusion spike protein, a process which
occurs prior to ACE2 binding.

Recently, several cryo-EM and computational studies have shed light on the differential receptor binding behavior of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins

6, 17, 21, 30, 31

. The

spike RBD undergoes a large-scale conformational transition from an inactive “down” position to
an active “up” position in order to access the ACE2 receptors on the host-cell surface

6, 17, 21, 32

.

Experimental studies investigating the binding affinity of the spike RBD for the ACE2-peptidase
domain (PD) have produced varying results. Wrapp et al.

21

and Tai et. al.

17

have reported that

the SARS-CoV-2 RBD has a reasonably higher binding affinity for ACE2-PD than the SARSCoV-1 RBD, using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and flow cytometry techniques, respectively.
For instance, the SPR-based assay showed that the dissociation constant of the SARS-CoV-2
spike protein (Kd ≈ 14.7 nM ) is 10-20 times lower than that of the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein 21, 33 . Another study used biolayer interferometry to show that the CoV-2 dissociation constant
(Kd ≈ 1.2 nM ) is only 4 times lower than that of the CoV-1 and stated that the binding affinities
were ”comparable” 6 . Such quantitative inconsistencies emphasize the need to improve our under4

standing of the mechanistic aspects of the RBD-ACE2 interaction. A disadvantage of experimental
techniques like SPR and biolayer interferometry is that they require the protein to be immobilized
prior to measuring the binding affinity 34, 35 . This introduces a level of bias into these experimental
assays, particularly if the binding behavior of a protein is conformation-dependent, as is the case
for the coronavirus spike proteins. The imposed protein immobilization thus causes the loss of
valuable information regarding the conformational changes that lead to spike activation. One may
argue, many studies so far have neglected the fact that the binding process involves not only the
RBD-ACE2 interaction but also the spike protein activation, a large-scale conformational change
with a potentially significant contribution to the differential binding behavior of SARS-CoV-1 and
2. Therefore, to gain a clearer understanding of the enhanced infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, “effective binding” involving both the RBD-ACE2 interaction and the spike activation/inactivation
process needs to be investigated. Here, we focus on the latter, which has received less attention in
the recent literature.

Cryo-EM studies have successfully resolved structures of both spike proteins in the inactive
state, active unbound state and active ACE2-bound state

6, 21, 25, 32, 36

. However, cryo-EM and X-

ray crystallography studies essentially capture static pictures of specific protein conformations and
do not provide detailed information on the dynamic behavior that drives major conformational
transitions 37–39 . Therefore, in this study, we investigate the differential conformational dynamics
of the CoV-1 and CoV-2 spike proteins using extensive microsecond-level unbiased and biased
MD simulations.

Our all-atom equilibrium MD simulations show that the active SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
is more stable than the active SARS-CoV-1 spike protein. We also report that the active CoV-1
spike RBD undergoes a spontaneous conformational transition to a pseudo-inactive state characterized by the interaction of the NTD and RBD. Electrostatic interaction analyses reveal that unique
salt-bridge interactions between the CoV-1 spike NTD and RBD are involved in this major conformational transition. No large-scale conformational changes occur in the active CoV-2 active spike
or inactive CoV-1/CoV-2 spike simulations within the timescale of our unbiased simulations (5
µs). In order to investigate the longer timescale conformational dynamics inaccessible to unbiased
simulations 40 , we have also employed extensive steered MD (SMD) simulations. The SMD simulations shed light on the energetics of the conformational change associated with the activation
and inactivation processes. The results obtained from these biased simulations strongly suggest
that the energy barriers for such conformational transitions, particularly inactivation, are significantly lower for the CoV-1 spike protein and that conformational changes occur more slowly for
the CoV-2 spike protein. This provides an explanation for the conformational plasticity displayed
by the active CoV-1 spike protein in our simulations as well as the relative conformational stability
of the active CoV-2 spike protein. The consistency of results from our equilibrium and nonequilibrium simulations thus provides a realistic picture of the long timescale conformational dynamics
of the Cov-1 and 2 spike proteins. The propensity of the active CoV-2 spike protein to maintain the
“up” RBD conformation might explain why it has a higher binding affinity for the ACE2 receptor,
which in turn could be directly linked to its comparatively high human-to-human transmissibility.

Results

Recent cryo-EM studies have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 spike glycoproteins
undergo large-scale conformational changes resulting in the exposure of the spike RBD to the
host ACE2 receptors

6, 32

. However, cryo-EM studies do not provide detailed information on the

dynamic behavior of the proteins 37 . Therefore, we have used a combination of biased and unbiased
microsecond-level all-atom MD simulations to shed light on the dynamics of the spike activation
process.

We have performed 4 unbiased all-atom MD simulations of the following models for 5 µs
each – inactive and active states of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 spike proteins. The active
state simulations for both CoV-1 and CoV-2 spike proteins were also repeated additionally twice
for another 5 µs each. We have thus generated 40 µs of equilibrium simulation trajectories in
aggregate. In addition, we have performed 80 independent SMD simulations of the CoV-1 and
2 spike proteins, each for 100 ns, to compare the long-term conformational dynamics of these
proteins that is otherwise inaccessible to unbiased MD.

The active SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is more stable than the active SARS-CoV-1 spike protein Visual inspection of the unbiased simulation trajectories reveals that the active SARS-CoV-2
spike protein is more stable than the active SARS-CoV-1 spike protein (Figure 1). The inactive
forms of both CoV-2 and CoV-1 spike proteins do not undergo any major conformational transitions during our 5 µs equilibrium simulations, with the RBDs remaining in the “down” position
relative to the NTD and S2 trimer (Figure 1A)

. On the other hand, a spontaneous large-scale

conformational change clearly occurs in the active CoV-1 spike simulation (Figure 1B), with the
RBD moving from an active “up” position to a pseudo-inactive conformation that is distinctly different from the conformation observed in the inactive state simulation and cryo-EM structure

32

.

This spontaneous conformational transition appears to occur due to interactions between the NTD
and RBD of the CoV-1 spike (Figure 1B). Unlike the active CoV-1 spike, the active CoV-2 spike
does not undergo any large-scale conformational transitions and remains relatively stable over 5 µs
(Figure 1B). The RBD of the active CoV-2 spike remains in the well-characterized “up” position
(Figure 1B)

6, 32

. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) (Figure S1) and root mean square fluctu-

ation (RMSF) (Figure S2) analyses demonstrate the relative stability of the active SARS-CoV-2
spike protein. A comparison of individual protomer RMSDs from all 3 replicas of the active CoV1 and CoV-2 spike trajectories, clearly shows that the active CoV-1 spike protein is relatively less
stable overall than the active CoV-2 spike protein (Figure S1). Similarly, RMSF analysis indicates
that the RBD and NTD regions of the active CoV-1 spike are more flexible than the corresponding
regions of the active CoV-2 spike protein (Figure S2).

In order to quantify the spontaneous conformational transition that occurs in the active CoV1 spike, we measured the center-of-mass distance between the receptor-binding motif (RBM) of
protomer A and the S2 trimer of the spike protein (Figure 1C). The RBM-S2 distance remains
stable for both inactive states at approximately 85 Å over 5 µs. For both the CoV-1 and CoV-2
active states, the RBM-S2 distance is initially around 100 Å but decreases to approximately 85 Å
for CoV-1 after 2 µs (Figure 1C). This analysis clearly demonstrates that the final conformation
adopted by the active CoV-1 spike RBD is similar to the inactive state RBD conformations of

both CoV-1 and CoV-2, in terms of the RBM-S2 trimer distance (Figure 1C). On other hand, the
RBM-S2 trimer distance for the active CoV-2 spike remains relatively unchanged over 5 µs (Figure
1C),thus recapitulating the observations gleaned from visual inspection of the trajectories (Figure
1A-B). Similarly, the angle between the RBM of protomer A and the S2 trimer remains relatively
unchanged for the CoV-2 active state, while the CoV-1 active state behaves like the inactive state
proteins during the last 3 µs of the simulation (Figure 1D).

We also calculated the minimum distance between the RBD and NTD of protomer A for
each system (Figure 1E), which quantifies the motion and position of the RBD relative to the
NTD. While the RBM-S2 distance and angle calculations indicate that the behavior of the CoV1 active state eventually resembles that of both inactive systems (Figure 1C-D), the NTD-RBD
distance calculation showcases the unique behavior of the active CoV-1 spike protein. The NTDRBD distance of the active protomer in CoV-1 fluctuates considerably over the first 2 µs of the
trajectory, after which it decreases sharply to settle down between 1-2 Å (Figure 1E). This clearly
demonstrates that the active CoV-1 spike RBD is in close proximity to the NTD as observed during
a visual inspection of the trajectories (Figure 1B). This is not observed for the active CoV-2 spike
or either of the inactive spike proteins (Figure 1A-B, 1E), thus indicating that the pseudo-inactive
conformation adopted by the active CoV-1 spike protein is unique. Additionally, a probability
density map was generated for water molecules within 5 Å of the RBM during the last 500 ns
of simulation (Figure 1F). The water molecule count for the CoV-1 active state is lower than that
of the CoV-2 active state and is comparable to the counts for the CoV-1/2 inactive states, further
confirming that the active CoV-1 spike protein undergoes a large-scale conformational transition

(Figure 1F).

Principal component analysis (PCA) and dynamic network analysis (DNA) provide evidence
of the conformational stability of the active CoV-2 spike protein We performed principal component analysis (PCA) to verify our claim that the active form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
is more stable than the active CoV-1 spike protein and to provide insight into the mechanistic aspects of the spike activation-inactivation process. When the individual protomer trajectories (see
Methods section) from the CoV-1/CoV-2 active (Set 1) and inactive simulations are projected onto
the space of their first two principal components (PC1 and PC2), it clearly demonstrates that the
CoV-1 active protomer A samples a much larger region in the PC1 space than CoV-2 active protomer A (Figure 2A, 2C). This is further evidence of the relative stability of the active CoV-2 spike
in comparison to the active CoV-1 spike.

A visual representation of PC1 for all protomers from the CoV-1 spike simulations shows
that the RBD undergoes the most pronounced motions directed inward towards the NTD (Figure
2B). On the other hand, a visual representation of PC1 for the CoV-2 spike shows that the RBD
and NTD tend to move away from each other slightly and that the fluctuations are significantly
smaller than in the CoV-1 spike. (Figure 2D). The most pronounced collective motion in each
system (PC1) describes the distinct motions associated with the RBD, that play key roles in the
inactivation of the active CoV-1 spike and maintenance of the active conformation of the CoV2 spike (Figure 1). This highlights the differential dynamic behavior of the active CoV-1 spike
protein.

PC2 describes the relative motions of the NTD and RBD, showing that the NTD motion is
more pronounced in CoV-1 (Figure S3). The motions associated with PC2 are roughly the opposite
of those associated with PC1 in terms of direction. PC2 also shows that the CoV-1 spike protein has
more regions outside the NTD and RBD that show high variance (Figure S3). Similar trends are
observed in Sets 2 and 3 of the active state simulations (Figure S4). While different protomers are
involved, the active CoV-1 spike protein still undergoes more pronounced motions in both PC1 and
PC2 compared to the active CoV-2 spike (Figure S4). These observations are in agreement with
our claim that the active CoV-2 spike is relatively stable and that the active CoV-1 spike transitions
spontaneously to a pseudo-inactive conformation.

The inferences drawn from PCA are also supported by dynamic network analysis (DNA).
Differential behavior of the active CoV-1 and CoV-2 spike proteins manifests in the correlation of
motions between the various domains in individual protomers.

In Figure 3A, correlation heat maps of active CoV-1 protomer A (Set 1) and inactive CoV1 protomer C are presented, along with the difference between the active state and the reference
structure (inactive protomer C). The heat map for active Cov-1 protomer A shows regions of high
correlation and anticorrelation between several domains of the protomer. The NTD correlates
strongly with itself while anticorrelating with the RBD and parts of the S2 region. The reference
protomer, inactive CoV-1 protomer C, shows a general reduction in correlation across all regions
(Figure 3A). The NTD does correlate with itself, but not as strongly as in the active CoV-1 protomer
A. Similarly, the NTD-RBD anticorrelations were reduced. The ∆ matrix of differences between

active CoV-1 protomer A and inactive protomer C identified the regions where the correlations
were most different. Correlations between S1-C and the NTD/RBD changed significantly, as did
correlations between the RBD and S2 region (Figure 3A).

The correlations and anti-correlations observed for active CoV-2 protomer A (Set 1) were
not as strong as those observed for active CoV-1 protomer A (Figure 3B). Similar to CoV-1, anticorrelation occurs between the NTD and RBD but is not as pronounced. Very low correlation was
observed between the NTD and S1-C/S2 regions, also differentiating CoV-2 from CoV-1. The
active CoV-2 protomer A is closer to the stable inactive CoV-2 protomer C, as shown in the ∆
matrix (Figure 3B). DNA correlation heat maps for all protomers in Set 1 of the CoV-1/CoV-2
active state simulations may be found in the supporting information (Figure S5-S6). Similar trends
were observed in Set 2 and Set 3 of the CoV-1 and CoV-2 active state simulations, shown in Figure
S7 and S8 respectively. These observations thus provide further evidence of the relative stability
of the active CoV-2 spike protein.

The concerted movements of each protomer relative to the rest of the trimer also highlight the
differences between the active CoV-1 and CoV-2 spike proteins. Heat maps showing correlations
between NTD regions of different protomers are presented in Figure 4A. Stronger correlations and
anticorrelations occurred in Sets 2 and 3 of the active CoV-1 simulations (Figure 4A). Set 2 showed
moderately strong anticorrelations between NTDs A-C and NTDs B-C. Stronger anti-correlations
between NTDs A-B and NTDs B-C occurred in Set 3, with moderate correlations between NTDs
A-C. The active CoV-2 simulations showed similar correlations across all three simulation sets,

with slightly increased values in Set 3 (Figure 4A). These observations are consistent with a more
stable conformation for the active CoV-2 spike protein.

Figure 4B shows a similar trend with correlations between the NTD and RBD regions of different protomers. Sets 2 and 3 of the active CoV-1 spike trajectories showed stronger correlations
between the NTD and RBD regions than the corresponding CoV-2 trajectories (Figure 4B). In particular, RBD C of Sets 2 and 3 had strong correlations or anticorrelations with the NTDs of all
protomers (Figure 4B). The CoV-2 simulations displayed lower correlations for all the NTD-RBD
combinations, with similar results for both active state and inactive state trajectories (Figure 4B).
This recapitulates our other observations of greater conformational stability of the active CoV-2
spike protein relative to the active CoV-1 spike protein (Figure 1-3).

Inter-domain electrostatic interactions between the NTD and RBD drive the inactivation of
the active CoV-1 spike protein As described previously, the active CoV-1 spike undergoes a
spontaneous large-scale conformational transition and essentially becomes inactivated (Figure 1AF). The RBD of the active protomer A moves towards and gets very close to the NTD, which
does not occur in the CoV-2 active and CoV-1/2 inactive trajectories (Figure 5A-B). The driving
force behind this conformational transition is a set of salt-bridge interactions that are unique to the
active CoV-1 spike. Residues D23 and D24 in the NTD interact with K365 in the RBD, forming
stable salt bridges in the active CoV-1 spike but not in the inactive state (Figure 5C-D). These
fairly stable salt-bridges form around the 1 µs mark (Figure 5C-D), prior to the final movement of
the RBD towards the NTD which happens after 2 µs (Figure 5A). Residues D23 and D24 are not

conserved in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

Differential behavior is also observed for two sets of residues that are conserved in both CoV1 and CoV-2 spike proteins (Figure S9). R328 and D578 form a stable salt bridge in both active and
inactive CoV-2 spike proteins while R315 and D564 do not form a salt-bridge in the CoV-1 spike
proteins (Figure S9A). Similarly, R273 and D290 form a stable salt bridge in the both active and
inactive CoV-2 spike proteins while K258 and D277 do not form a salt-bridge in the CoV-1 spike
proteins (Figure S9B). Additionally, a conserved pair of residues form an intra-RBD hydrogen
bond in the active/inactive CoV-2 spike (Y396-E516) and the inactive CoV-1 spike (Y383-E502),
but not in the active CoV-1 spike (Y383-E502) (Figure S10A-B). These electrostatic interactions
thus potentially contribute to the relative stability of the active SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These
observations are in agreement with the results obtained through visual inspection of the trajectories
as well as the other analyses described previously (Figure 1-4).

The propensity of the active CoV-1 spike protein to deviate from its ”RBD-up” conformation
is in marked contrast to the stability displayed by the active CoV-2 spike protein in our unbiased
microsecond-level simulations. The active SARS-CoV-1 spike protein consistently exhibits a differential dynamic behavior that could potentially explain why SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible
than SARS-Cov-1 8, 9 .

SMD simulations indicate that the SARS-Cov-2 spike has larger energy barriers to largescale conformational changes than the CoV-1 spike Steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations were performed to quantify and characterize the energetics of the activation-inactivation

process for the SARS CoV-1 and CoV-2 spike proteins. To induce the activation or inactivation of
individual protomers, we used collective variables based on the Cα RMSD of each protomer. 10
sets of 100 ns SMD simulations were performed for each system. The conformational transition of
an inactive receptor-binding domain to the active “up” position was accompanied by a decrease in
the RBM-S2 angle and an increase in the RBM-S2 distance (Figure 6A-B). Similarly, the inactivation of an active protomer was characterized by an increase in the RBM-S2 angle and a decrease
in the RBM-S2 distance (Figure 6A-B).

Without performing strict free-energy calculations, we have used non-equilibrium work measurements to compare the thermodynamics and kinetics of the CoV-1 and CoV-2 spike activationinactivation process in a semi-quantitative manner. We have previously used similar methods to
investigate conformational transitions of other biomolecular systems 41–44 . The accumulated nonequilibrium work measured during the inactivation of an active CoV-2 protomer or the activation of
an inactive CoV-2 protomer, is significantly larger than the work measured during the inactivation
or activation of a CoV-1 protomer (Figure 6C-D). Similarly, the change in the associated Jarzynski average is also much higher for the CoV-2 protomers (Figure 6C-D). These results strongly
suggest that the CoV-2 spike protein has slower kinetics in both directions and that the conformational change associated with activation or inactivation proceeds more slowly than in the Cov-1
spike protein. This is in very good agreement with our observations on the relative conformational
stability of the active CoV-2 spike protein from the unbiased simulations.

Additionally, the change in Jarzynski average with respect to the difference in RMSD be-

tween inactive and active states, is relatively higher for the CoV-2 spike protein (Figure 6E-F). The
Jarzynksi average associated with inactivation of the active CoV-1 spike is much lower than the
Jarzynski average associated with the other conformational transitions (Figure 6E). This indicates
that the inactivation process is much easier for the CoV-1 spike in comparison to the CoV-2 spike
and explains why we were able to observe a spontaneous conformational transition in the unbiased
active CoV-1 trajectory within 5 µs. On the other hand, there are considerable energy barriers to
the activation process for both CoV-1 and Cov-2 spike proteins (Figure 6F), explaining the fact that
the inactive forms of both spike proteins remain extremely stable during our unbiased simulations.
These results from our biased SMD simulations are thus very consistent with the results from our
unbiased equilibrium simulations, highlighting the stability of the active CoV-2 spike protein and
the relative conformational plasticity of the active CoV-1 spike protein.

Our SMD simulations thus conclusively show that it is relatively difficult for the CoV-2 spike
protein to undergo a large-scale conformational transition between active and inactive states, when
compared to the CoV-1 spike protein. These SMD simulations involved single protomers and were
also repeated with all 3 protomers (Figure S11). We observed similar behavioral trends in the multiprotomer SMD simulations (Figure S11). Our results indicate that the energy barriers to these
conformational changes are larger in the CoV-2 spike protein and that the activation-inactivation
mechanism might be more energetically favorable in the CoV-1 spike protein. This provides a
rationale for the spontaneous conformational transition observed in the active CoV-1 spike equilibrium simulation and the absence of similar conformational changes in the corresponding CoV-2
spike simulation (Figure 1).

Discussion

Using microsecond-timescale unbiased and biased simulations, we have demonstrated that the active SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 spike proteins exhibit differential dynamic behavior. The active CoV-2 spike protein remains relatively stable over 5 µs, whereas the active CoV-1 spike protein
spontaneously adopts a pseudo-inactive conformation that is distinct from the well-characterized
inactive “RBD-down” conformation 32 . An interesting feature of this unique CoV-1 spike conformation is the interaction between the RBD and NTD, which is not observed in the normal inactive
conformation

32

. As shown by PCA analysis, the RBD of the active state CoV-1 spike moves

inward towards the NTD. This pronounced motion of the RBD enables the formation of unique
salt-bridge interactions between the NTD and RBD, which drive the conformational transition.
We have also identified stabilizing salt-bridge and hydrogen-bond interactions between conserved
residue pairs, that form in the CoV-2 spike but not in the CoV-1 spike.

In general, our PCA analysis indicates that the active CoV-1 spike protein shows more pronounced motions over the course of the simulations. This is corroborated by dynamic network
analysis, which illustrates that the active CoV-2 spike has markedly weaker intra-protomer and
inter-protomer correlations and anticorrelations than the active CoV-1 spike. These observations
are consistent with the relative conformational stability of the active CoV-2 spike protein. An investigation of the energetics of the activation-inactivation process using SMD simulations revealed
that it is relatively difficult for the CoV-2 spike protein to undergo a major conformational transition
from the active state to the inactive state or vice-versa. Non-equilibrium work measurements indi-

cate that large-scale conformational transitions occur relatively slowly in the CoV-2 spike protein,
which complements our observations on the relative conformational stability of the active CoV-2
spike from the equilibrium simulations. We also found that the energy barriers involved in the inactivation of the CoV-1 spike protein are quite low, thus explaining the spontaneous conformational
transition observed in the active CoV-1 equilibrium trajectory. The results from our equilibrium
and non-equilibrium simulations are thus very consistent and provide extensive insights into the
long-term dynamics of the CoV-1 and CoV-2 spike proteins. A recent computational study has
shown that the CoV-2 spike RBD has greater mechanical stability than the CoV-1 spike RBD

45

,

which validates our observations on the conformational stability of the active CoV-2 spike protein.

Recently, Anand et al. proposed that the SARS-CoV-1 spike protein needs to overcome comparatively higher energy barriers to adopt the active conformation 46 , which is the opposite of what
we observe in our simulations. However, their proposed energy landscape is based on inferences
drawn from cryo-EM data and does not take the inherently dynamic nature of the proteins into account 46 . Unlike X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, MD simulations are able to provide detailed
information on the dynamic behavior of proteins and other biomolecules 38, 39 .

Our simulations thus provide valuable insight into the dynamic behavior of the CoV-1 and
CoV-2 spike proteins. An improved understanding of the conformational changes leading to activation or inactivation of the spike proteins, is critical to the effective development of novel therapeutics and vaccines using a structure-based drug design framework. As discussed earlier, investigation of the ”effective binding” process involving both receptor interaction and spike activation

will provide deeper insights into the enhanced infectivity of SARS-Cov-2. Several studies have
investigated RBD-ACE2 binding for both SARS CoV-1 47–53 and SARS-CoV-2 6, 17, 21, 30, 31 , while
ignoring the conformational dynamics of spike activation and inactivation. For the first time, our
microsecond-level unbiased and biased simulations provide insights into the differential activation
and inactivation processes of the SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2 spike proteins. Therefore, we propose
that the ”effective binding” process is different in CoV-1 and 2 spike proteins, not only because of
the variability of the RBD but also due to the contribution of other regions like the NTD (as seen
in the spontaneous conformational change involving the active CoV-1 spike). Our simulations
strongly suggest that the differential conformational dynamics associated with inactivation and activation might contribute to the increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. However, additional
experimental and computational studies are needed to fully investigate this possibility.

A recent study has shown that glycosylation of the spike proteins might play an important
role in the conformational dynamics of the RBD 54 . At this stage, We have not simulated the glycosylated spike proteins due to the difficulty of modeling the correct glycan chains. Additionally,
it would be quite difficult to determine whether conformational changes occur as a result of the
intrinsic protein dynamics or the differential glycosylation patterns of the CoV-1 and CoV-2 spike
proteins. In order to further validate our results, we do plan to eventually repeat our simulations
using the fully glycosylated forms of both spike proteins.

Methods

All-atom equilibrium MD simulations We have used all-atom equilibrium MD simulations to
characterize the conformational dynamics of the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 and SARSCoV-1. Our simulations were based on cryo-EM structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
in the active (PDB entry:6VYB) 6 and inactive (PDB entry:6VXX) 6 states and the SARS-CoV-1
spike protein in the active (PDB entry:5X5B) 32 and inactive (PDB entry:5X58) 32 states. Missing
residues and loop regions for all 4 models were generated using Modeller 55 . A Monte Carlo algorithm was used to iteratively minimize the energy of the system 55 . 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations
were used to generate the initial models for the equilibrium simulations. CHARMM-GUI 56, 57 was
then used to build the simulation systems. Engineered residues (P986, P987)

33, 58

in the SARS-

CoV-2 spike protein were mutated back to the wildtype residues (K986, V987). The protein was
solvated in a box of TIP3P waters, and 0.15 M NaCl (in addition to the counterions used to neutralize the protein) using CHARMM-GUI 56, 57 . The box size for the CoV-2 active model was 198
x 198 x 198 Å3 with 730937 atoms. The box size for the CoV-2 inactive model was 183 x 183 x
183 Å3 with 577927 atoms. The box size for the CoV-1 active model was 193 x 193 x 193 Å3 with
680615 atoms. The box size for the CoV-1 inactive model was 169 x 169 x 169 Å3 with 454608
atoms.
All simulations were performed using the NAMD 2.13 59 simulation package with the CHARMM36
all-atom additive force field 60 . The input files for energy minimization and production were generated using CHARMM-GUI

56, 57

. Initially, we energy-minimized each system for 10,000 steps

using the conjugate gradient algorithm 61 . Then, we relaxed the systems using restrained MD sim26

ulations in a stepwise manner using the standard CHARMM-GUI protocol 56, 57 (”relaxation step”).
In the next step, backbone and sidechain restraints were used for 10 ns with a force constant of
50 kcal/mol.Å2 (”restraining step”). The systems were then equilibrated with no bias for another
10 ns (”equilibration step”). The initial relaxation was performed in an NVT ensemble while the
rest of the simulations were performed in an NPT ensemble. Simulations were carried out using a 2-fs time step at 310 K using a Langevin integrator with a damping coefficient of γ = 0.5
ps− 1. The pressure was maintained at 1 atm using the Nose-Hoover Langevin piston method 61, 62 .
The smoothed cutoff distance for non-bonded interactions was set at 10 to 12 Å and long-range
electrostatic interactions were computed with the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method 63 .

These initial simulations were executed on TACC Longhorn. The production run for each
model was then extended to 5 µs on Anton2 64 , with a timestep of 2.5 fs. Conformations were collected every 240 picoseconds. Initial processing of the Anton2 simulation trajectories was carried
out on Kollman 64 . Two additional µs simulations were performed for both the CoV-2 and CoV-1
active models on Anton2 (referred to as Set 2 and Set 3 in the manuscript). The initial production
runs for these models on TACC Longhorn were extended twice by 0.5 ns in order to generate the
starting conformations for the repeat simulations. 40 µs of simulation data was generated in aggregate – 15 µs each for the Cov-1/Cov-2 active spike proteins and 5 µs each for the inactive spike
proteins.

RBM-S2 distance and angle calculations To quantify the RBM-S2 distance, we defined centers
of mass based on residues that form a beta-sheet in the RBM region of each RBD (CoV-1: RBM
residues 439 to 441, 479 to 481; CoV-2: RBM residues 452 to 454, 492 to 494) and residues that

encompass the S2 trimer (CoV-1: S2 residues 672 to 1104; CoV-2: S2 residues 690 to 1147). We
then measured the vector distance between the two centers of mass and used the vector magnitude
to quantify the overall distance.

For the RBM-S2 angle, we chose residues at the top and bottom of the straightest region of
the S2 Trimer (alpha-helical regions in CoV-1: residues 970 and 1016; CoV-2: residues 914 and
987). Similarly, we also chose residues from the beta-sheet region of the RBM and one at the
bottom of the RBD (CoV-1: residues 348 and 478; CoV-2: residues 391 and 493). We then defined
a vector direction using the vector subtraction of the two chosen residues in the S2 region and the
residues of the RBD region, which were defined as v1 and v2 . The vector angle between the RBD

subtracted from 180◦ . An angle above ≈60◦ would indicate an RBD in the inactive conformation
with respect to S2, and 0-40◦ would indicate an RBD in the active conformation.

NTD-RBD distance calculations and water count To characterize conformational changes in
the active and inactive states of both CoV-1 and CoV-2 spike proteins, we calculated the minimum
distance between every residue of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the N-terminal domain
(NTD). We measured the distance between each residue pair in these regions (maximum distance
cut off was 20 Å) as a function of time. The domains were defined as follows: CoV-2 RBD
(residues 330 to 515); CoV-2 NTD (residues 60 to 270); CoV-1 RBD (residues 330 to 550); CoV-1
NTD (residues 35 to 255).

The amount of solvent around the receptor binding motif (RBM) was quantified using a

VMD65 script. We calculated the number of water molecules within 5 Å of the RBM for every
frame of the last 500 ns of each trajectory and also plotted probability density maps for each water
count.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Principal component analysis (PCA) performed with ProDy
66

was used to quantify the persistent conformational changes and relative motions of the active

and inactive states. Only the position of the C-α atoms of the spike protein was considered when
building the covariance matrix of atomic positions, in order to focus on the large conformational
changes and ignore side chain fluctuations.

The CoV-1/CoV-2 active state (Set 1) and CoV-1/CoV-2 inactive state trajectories were
stripped down to trajectories of the individual protomers from each simulation. The individual
protomers were then analyzed together to compare and quantify the relative motions of the active and inactive states. Through eigenvalue decomposition, the top twenty principal components
(PCs) were calculated for each protomer. The top two PCs for each protomer have been plotted to
identify the major motions of the protein.

Each trajectory was aligned with the positions from the cryo-EM structure before analysis,
with only the C-α atoms considered.

Dynamic Network Analysis (DNA) Dynamic network analysis (DNA) of the correlated motions
of the protein provided further quantitative information on the concerted motions of the C-alpha
atoms of the protein. MD-TASK 67 , a software suite of MD analysis tools, was used to calculate
the correlation coefficient for the motion of each C-α atom relative to the other C-α atoms. A

correlation matrix M was generated for each of the three protomers in all the simulated trajectories.
Additionally, a correlation matrix for the entire trimer was calculated for each simulation to explore
correlations between structures of different protomers. A step size of four frames was used during
the correlation calculations to reduce the processing times, given the large number of residues.

To quantify the differences in correlation between a protomer and some reference, a difference matrix, ∆ was calculated,
∆ = |Mi − MRef. |,

(1)

where Mi is the correlation matrix of interest, and MRef is the correlation matrix of a reference
conformation. In this work, the difference between a protomer in an active conformation and an
inactive conformation was of interest. For this reason, the protomers in the active simulations were
compared with Protomer C in the inactive simulation, which displayed relatively little motion.

Electrostatic interaction analysis To identify interactions that contribute to the stability of the
Cov-2 spike protein or play key roles in the CoV-1 active conformational transition, we performed salt-bridge and hydrogen-bond analysis for all SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 systems.
Salt bridges were identified using the VMD Timeline plugin 68 at a cutoff distance of 4.0 Å. The
salt-bridge cutoff distance is defined as the distance between the oxygen atom of the participating
acidic residue and the nitrogen atom of the basic residue. The VMD HBond plugin

68

was used

for hydrogen bond analysis. The donor-acceptor distance and angle cutoffs used were 3.5 Å) and
30 degrees respectively. We report salt-bridge and hydrogen-bond interactions that illustrate the
differential behavior of the SARS-CoV-2 and CoV-1 spike proteins.

Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) Simulations To induce activation/inactivation of a protomer initially in the inactive/active conformation, we defined collective variables based on the the
Cα RMSD of each protomer in the CoV-1 and CoV-2 systems. Reference coordinates were taken
from the corresponding active/inactive structure for both CoV-1 and CoV-2 protomers. The atoms
chosen were based on the total number of resolved and modeled residues in the CoV-2 structures.
Structural analysis of CoV-1 and CoV-2 was employed to ensure that equivalent Cα atoms were
steered in all simulation sets. 1037 atoms were steered for any given protomer and the following
residue range was used: 27 to 239, 244 to 315, 322 to 662, 673 to 809, and 831 to 1104. These
atoms span the entire protomer, starting from the NTD and ending approximately at the C-terminus
of the S2 region. A force constant of 250 kcal/mol/Å2 was used for SMD simulations involving a
single protomer and a force constant of 750 kcal/mol/Å2 was used for SMD simulations involving
all three protomers.

The systems used for each simulation were taken from the outcome of the ”equilibration
step” (see Initial Preparation in Methods) as explained in the equilibrium simulation methods.
Utilizing the multi-copy capabilities of NAMD, we performed 10 sets of 100 ns RMSD steering
for each system - 8µs of simulation time in aggregate.

For all SMD time series analyses, each data point was averaged for the 10 sets and standard
deviation was calculated. Each analysis was plotted with 100 points and error bars were derived
from the standard deviation. The RBM-S2 distance and angle calculations were performed as
described previously.

Using the Jarzynski relation 69 we calculate the Jarzynski average at time t during the activation or inactivation process as −kB T ln

constant and the temperature, respectively and Wi is the work accumulated from the beginning
of the SMD simulation i up to time t. The above average would converge to the free energy
for large number of trajectories (N → ∞). For N = 10, the above average simply provides a
semi-quantitative measure for relative energetic comparisons 41–44 .

All RMSD calculations are represented as the ∆RMSD. The ∆RMSD represents the RMSD
with respect to the inactive conformation minus the RMSD with respect to the active conformation
for all systems. Using the ∆RMSD, we binned each point with respect to the associated work for
a given simulation set. Approximately 100 bins were used. Using that work, we converted it to the
approximate free energy using the Jarzynski relation. Standard error of the work from all 10 sets
for a given system was used for the error bars.
