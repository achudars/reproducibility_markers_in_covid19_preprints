For purposes of genomic epidemiology, a consensus genome
sequence is derived from each sample but deep sequencing
data invariably reveal some level of within-host variation (3)
and minor alleles are commonly filtered out prior to phylogenetic analysis (4). It has been suggested that SARS-CoV-2,
like SARS-CoV-1 evolves within an infected host as a quasispecies, with many mutations (within-host variants) arising
which may be beneficial for the virus (3, 5, 6). Although
there have been several previous reports on the within-host
diversity of SARS-CoV-2 (3, 7, 8) a number of key questions
remain to be resolved. Examples of underexplored questions include understanding the extent of sequencing artefacts
among within-host variants, the mutational processes dominating SARS-CoV-2 evolution, the action of selection on
within-host variants and the extent to which superinfection
or co-transmission of multiple lineages confound within-host
diversity analyses (9). Better understanding of these questions can shed light on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and
could inform efforts to reconstruct transmission chains with
genomic data.

Monitoring the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reconstructing
transmission chains has become a major public health focus
for many governments around the world. The modest mutation rate and rapid transmission of SARS-CoV-2 prevents the
reconstruction of transmission chains from consensus genome
sequences, but within-host genetic diversity could theoretically
help identify close contacts. Here we describe the patterns of
within-host diversity in 1,181 SARS-CoV-2 samples sequenced
to high depth in duplicate. 95% of samples show within-host
mutations at detectable allele frequencies. Analyses of the mutational spectra revealed strong strand asymmetries suggestive
of damage or RNA editing of the plus strand, rather than replication errors, dominating the accumulation of mutations during
the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Within and between host diversity
show strong purifying selection, particularly against nonsense
mutations. Recurrent within-host mutations, many of which
coincide with known phylogenetic homoplasies, display a spectrum and patterns of purifying selection more suggestive of mutational hotspots than recombination or convergent evolution.
While allele frequencies suggest that most samples result from
infection by a single lineage, we identify multiple putative examples of co-infection. Integrating these results into an epidemiological inference framework, we find that while sharing
of within-host variants between samples could help the reconstruction of transmission chains, mutational hotspots and rare
cases of superinfection can confound these analyses.

Introduction
The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused global disruption and
more than one million deaths (1). Genomic analysis has
yielded important insights into the origins and spread of the
pandemic, and has been an integral part of efforts to monitor viral transmission in the UK, with over 100,000 viral
genomes sequenced as of December 2020 by the COVID-19

To address these questions, we performed Illumina deep sequencing of over a thousand SARS-CoV-2 samples collected
in March and April 2020 in the East of England. Two libraries were sequenced for each sample with separate reverse
transcription (RT), PCR amplification and library preparation
steps in order to evaluate the quality and reproducibility of
within-host variant calls. To develop reliable methods for
analysing within-host variation in the context of ongoing genomic epidemiological studies, we used the ARTIC protocol
which is a common method used for SARS-CoV-2 genome
sequencing by many labs around the world (10). Analyses of
the data provided insights into the extent of within-host diversity, the patterns of mutagenesis and the extent of selection,
and suggested that amplification biases, hypermutable sites

for epidemiological purposes.

due to low sensitivity to within-host variants at lower allele
frequencies and due to the stringent requirement that a variant
is detected as significant in both replicates.

Results
The mutational spectra reveal strong strand asymmetries. Analysis of the mutational spectrum can yield in-

1,181 samples in duplicate at a median sequencing coverage
ranging from 998 to 49,025 read depth per replicate sample (Supplementary Figure 1; Supplementary Table 1). To
study variable sites within an individual, including errors
and within-host mutations, for each sample we first identified all variable sites with variant allele frequency > 0.5%
and at least 5 supporting reads. Comparison of calls between
replicates revealed that, while some samples showed highlyconcordant variants between replicates, others showed high
discordance (Supplementary Figure 2). The discordance between some replicates suggested that a small number of
molecules may be disproportionately amplified in some samples, amplifying both RT/PCR errors and rare within-host
mutations to high allele frequencies. We quantified the discordance between replicates using a beta-binomial model
(Methods) and correlated this with the diagnostic qPCR Ct
values, which are inversely related to the number of viral
molecules within the samples. Samples with Ct≥ 24 showed
considerable discordance in allele frequencies between replicates (Supplementary Figure 3) but the vast majority of samples with Ct< 24 showed good concordance between replicates. This indicated that as the viral loads decrease, amplification biases and artefacts are common and can impact within-host diversity analyses using RT-PCR protocols.
For all subsequent analyses we used only those within-host
variants that were statistically supported by both replicates
(Methods). To reliably detect within-host variants with the
ARTIC protocol, we used ShearwaterML, an algorithm designed to detect variants at low allele frequencies using a
site-specific error model learned from a collection of reference samples (11, 12) (Methods). Two samples were excluded, as they had an unusually high number of minor variant calls unlikely to be of biological origin, leaving 1,179
samples for analysis, comprising 1,121 infected individuals
of whom 49 had multiple samples. Within each sample,
we classified variant calls into major variants (≥ 95% allele frequency) and within-host variants (< 95%). In total,
we identified 18,888 putative variants (Supplementary Table
2), including 7,190 major variants (affecting 948 sites) and
11,698 within-host variants (affecting 5,625 sites). Withinhost variants included 7,561 single-nucleotide substitutions,
3,235 small deletions, 548 small insertions and 354 putative
multi-nucleotide variants (Methods). The allele frequency
spectrum was dominated by fixed mutations that were common to all viral RNA molecules in a sample, and a tail of
mostly low frequency variants, as previously described (Lythgoe et al. 2020) (Figure 1A-C). The mean and median allele
frequencies of within-host variants was 7.2% and 1.9%, respectively. Overall, within-host variants were detected in the
vast majority of samples (95.2%), with a median of 8 withinhost variants per sample. This is likely to be an underestimate

sights into the dominant mutational mechanisms underlying
the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic. Consistent with previous reports (13), the mutational spectrum
of within-host variant closely resembles that of major variants (Figure 2). The spectrum shows two striking features:
a dominance of C>U and G>U changes with weak extended
sequence context, and a large asymmetry between the plus
and minus strands, inferred from the high C>U/G>A and
G>U/C>A ratios when mutations are mapped to the reference (plus) strand. C>U mutations account for 47% of all
within-host point mutations compared to 5.9% for G>A mutations (C>U mutations in the minus strand), and G>U mutations for 14.5% of mutations compared to 2.2% of C>A
mutations (Methods). Normalised for sequence composition,
the plus/minus strand ratios of the rates of C>U and G>U are
9.9-fold and 8.2-fold, respectively.
These asymmetries appear difficult to explain if mutations
were direct replication errors. Since any given viral RNA
molecule has undergone the same number of plus-to-minus
and minus-to-plus replication steps, replication errors are
only expected to cause these asymmetries if both steps have
very different error rates. For example, if the polymerase had
a high C>U error rate in both strands, we would expect a symmetric number of C>U and G>A mutations in the plus strand,
as C>Us would be introduced at equal rates when copying the
plus or the minus strands (Figure 2E). Within a cell, the fact
that minus templates are copied many times could theoretically lead to a viral population with fewer G>A mutations
but at higher frequencies (14, 15). However, the fact that
the same asymmetries are observed for major variants, which
typically represent the fixation of a single genotype, makes
this an unlikely factor. Thus, unless the error rates of the
RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase in SARS-CoV-2 are very
different on both strands, which may be possible given its
multisubunit structure (16), replication errors seem unlikely
to explain the observed asymmetries.
The strong strand asymmetries observed may be more consistent with RNA damage or RNA editing of the plus strand
dominating the accumulation of mutations in SARS-CoV-2.
The plus strand is the infectious genome, exported from the
replication organelles, where minus molecules reside, into
the cytoplasm (17), translated, packaged into particles and
transmitted between cells and hosts. The plus strand is also
present within cells in much larger numbers than the minus
strand (14). Thus, the plus strand may be expected to accumulate higher rates of damage or editing, which would
manifest as strand asymmetries. If we accept this hypothesis, the dominance of C>U over G>A and G>U over C>A,
when mapped to the plus strand, suggests that the dominant
forms of RNA editing or damage are C>U and G>U.

single-stranded DNA and RNA molecules and are known
anti-viral mechanisms (18, 19). Two families of RNA-editing
enzymes in particular have been speculated to contribute to
the mutational spectrum of SARS-CoV-2, APOBEC cytosine deaminase enzymes causing cytosine to uracil transitions
and ADAR enzymes causing adenosine-to-inosine changes
(A>G/U>C mutations) (19). While we see a high rate of C>U
changes in the SARS-CoV-2 spectra, we see much lower
rates of A>G/U>C mutations than previously suggested (20).
While the mutational spectrum induced by all APOBEC enzymes is not fully understood, the activity of the betterunderstood APOBEC3A and 3B enzymes in human cancers
is distinctly characterised by a strong sequence context, leadTonkin-Hill et al.

This contrasts with the weak context dependence observed
in the SARS-CoV-2 spectrum. While RNA-editing enzymes
may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 mutagenesis, direct damage
of cytosine and guanine bases could also be consistent with
the observed spectrum. For example, spontaneous cytosine
deamination would cause C>U transitions while oxidation of
guanine bases could explain G>U transversions (22). Both
forms of damage are common mutagenic processes in human
cells (23).
Having described the mutational spectrum, we can also derive approximate estimates of the average number of withinhost mutations per viral genome in a sample. Since the albioRχiv

uses a Poisson framework allowing for complex substitution models including context dependence, strand asymmetry, non-equilibrium of substitutions and estimation of dN/dS
ratios for missense and nonsense mutations separately. This
model is particularly suitable for datasets with low mutation
density in lowly- or non-recombining populations, as it is the
case in SARS-CoV-2 genomic data (28).
As expected, dN/dS ratios for major variants are under clear
purifying selection (Figure 4A), with particularly strong selection against nonsense mutations. Within-host variants
reaching moderately high allele frequencies (VAF>10%) display similarly strong purifying selection against missense
and nonsense mutations as major variants (Figure 4A), while
within-host variants at low allele frequencies appear to be under more relaxed purifying selection, as it may be expected.
Purifying selection against nonsense mutations can also be
observed at the level of allele frequencies (Figure 4B). Overall, the similarity of dN/dS ratios for major and moderateVAF within-host variants suggests that selection within hosts,
rather than during transmission, may explain a considerable
fraction of the extent of purifying selection observed in consensus sequences.

Many recurrently mutated sites appear to represent
mutational hotspots. Some sites across the SARS-CoV-

2 genome appear to have mutated independently multiple
times, resulting in homoplasic sites across the viral phylogeny (30). Some of these sites have also been reported
to recurrently appear as within-host variants, although it remains unclear to what extent these events represent recurrent
sequencing errors, contamination between samples, coinfection of a sample by multiple lineages, recombination, mutational hotspots or convergent positive selection (3, 13, 30).
Coinfection by multiple lineages could possibly arise from
superinfection, where an individual acquires infection from
multiple sources, or by co-transmission of multiple lineages
from host to host following an episode of superinfection.
Figure 4C represents the distribution of recurrent within-host
variants across the genome. 190 sites are observed as withinhost variants in at least 5 (0.4%) of our samples. Sequencing
or PCR errors are unlikely to contribute substantially to the
recurrent variants observed in our dataset thanks to the use of
replicates and the ShearwaterML algorithm. One mechanism
by which the same within-host variant can be observed across
multiple closely-related samples is transmission of withinhost variants between contacts, when a population of virions
is transmitted between hosts. Under this scenario, sharing of
within-host variants will be expected between samples with
identical major variants, as the preservation of a within-host
variant is incompatible with the simultaneous fixation of new
major variants (the within-host allele would either be purged
or hitchhike and become fixed). Instead, we find that most
recurrent within-host variants occur across lineages, independently of the genomic background of major variants present
in a sample (Figure 4E). This pattern is suggestive of recurrent mutation, although it could also be consistent with complex histories of superinfection and recombination.

lele frequency of a mutation represents the fraction of viral
RNA molecules in a sample carrying a mutation, we can estimate the mean within-host mutation load by summing the
allele frequencies of all observed within-host variants in a
sample (12). Importantly, this is an approximation as it assumes that each RNA molecule sequenced, originated from
the entire viral genome which is not always the case given
the abundance of viral sgRNAs (24, 25). These estimates
are also likely to be a conservative lower-bound as they only
include mutations at detectable allele fractions in both replicates. Across samples, we found a mean within-host mutation load per viral genome of 0.72 mutations (median 0.37)
(Figure 1D). Phylogenetic studies estimate a mutation rate
in SARS-CoV-2 of 0.001 mutations/bp/year (26), or 0.082
mutations/genome/day. Thus, the observed within-host mutation load would be consistent with the expected acquisition
of mutations during a relatively short span of several days.
To investigate the possible accumulation of de novo mutations during the course of an infection, we studied 43 individuals for whom we had multiple samples collected at different
timepoints (Figure 3A, Supplementary Figure 4). Overall the
number of within-host variants tended to increase over time
and this trend was significant using a Poisson mixed model
to control for host-specific effects (p=0.007; Figure 3B). To
put this finding in context, there was considerable variation
in the observed number of within-host variants among samples from the same individual, even if taken on the same day,
possibly as a result of bottlenecks caused by the different
sampling methods which included sputum, swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage (Supplementary Figure 5). High variability between longitudinal samples has also been observed in
six out of nine hospitalised patients in Austria (13). Using
data from nine patients with longitudinal samples, the authors
found that the divergence in variant frequencies between serial samples from the same patient was on average greater
than that between donor-recipient transmission pairs. The authors observed multiple instances of the fixation of a variant
over the course of an infection. In contrast, we observed no
change in the consensus genome sequence in any of the individuals from whom multiple samples were collected. It is
possible that the accumulation of within-host mutations could
in future be used to estimate time since infection. However,
determining if a consistent signal could be observed given
the extensive variation observed between repeated samples
on the same day would require analysis of time-series data
in a larger number of individuals with high quality epidemiological data.

Within-host variants display strong purifying selection
against nonsense mutations. To study the extent of se-

lection acting on within-host variants and major variants, we
calculated dN/dS ratios using the dNdScv package (Methods). Most commonly-used software to calculate dN/dS use
simple substitution models (often using a single transitiontransversion ratio), which can lead to considerable biases and
false signals of selection under neutrality (28, 29). dNdScv

If we accept the hypothesis of recurrent mutation, there remains the question of whether this is caused by mutational
hotspots or convergent positive selection. We observed that
25% (51/205) of recurrent (n ≥ 5) within-host variants are
predicted to cause synonymous mutations and estimates of
the dN/dS ratio corrected for the trinucleotide sequence context indicate that, as a group, these recurrent variants are
under some purifying selection (Figure 4A). This suggests
that most recurrent within-host variants are likely to represent hypermutable sites rather than convergent positive selection. Their mutational spectrum suggests an enrichment for
C>U changes, particularly at sites preceded by a pyrimidine,
but the mechanisms behind their apparent hypermutability
remain unclear (Supplementary Figure 6). Still, this analysis does not rule out the possibility that a minority of recurrent within-host variants are the result of convergent positive selection. A plausible example is the spike glycoprotein
mutation D614G, which has rapidly increased in frequency
throughout the world: this appears as a within-host variant in 12 of our samples, and typically with a higher allele
frequency than other recurrent within-host variants (median
VAF 0.56 vs 0.036, Wilcoxon test P=3.98e-4).

by geographical location.
To explore the relationship between within-host variants and
the consensus phylogeny, we identified within-host variants
that are shared between samples, as illustrated by links between the tips of the phylogenetic tree in Figure 5B. This
confirmed that within-host variants are often shared between
samples that are distant on the consensus phylogeny. Both a
high level of recombination and a large transmission bottleneck would be required for within-host variants to be maintained across long transmission chains in order to explain the
simultaneous preservation of some within-host variants with
the fixation of others. While, recent studies have suggested
that the bottleneck in SARS-CoV-2 transmission can be on
the order of 102 -103 virions, they also identified substantial
overlaps in the fraction of shared minority variants between
samples unrelated by close transmission (13, 31). The sharing of within-host variants between consensus genomes as divergent as 10 SNPs, indicating multiple months of separation
between the samples suggests that a more likely explanation
is that many of these shared within-host variants are the result
of recurrent mutation or co-infection (Fig 6D).
To further investigate the correspondence between shared
within-host variants and transmission, we used the transcluster algorithm to infer the probability distribution of
the number of intermediate hosts that separate each pair of
samples(32). This pairwise approach accounts for the serial
interval of the virus as well as its evolutionary rate using the
difference in the number of SNPs between each pair of consensus genomes. Fig 6B illustrates the relationship between
the mean number of shared within-host variants and the probability that the respective infections were a result of direct
transmission. A weak correlation with transmission probability was found for shared within-host variants of high allele
frequency, but not for those of low allele frequency.

Extensive sharing of minority variants across a
diverse genomic background suggests caution is
needed when using within-host variants for the inference of transmission. In order to investigate the genetic

background of our samples we generated a maximum likelihood phylogeny of all consensus genomes produced by the
COG-UK consortium by the end of May 2020, including
those for the samples on our dataset (Figure 5A). This showed
that our samples represent a broad range of the SARS-CoV-2
genetic diversity found in the UK at that time, and that the diversity observed among our samples was not primarily driven

Co-infections correlate with the consensus phylogeny
consistent with cases of superinfection induced
by population structure. It has been proposed that co-

infection by different lineages is a significant source of
within-host variation in SARS-CoV-2 (3). Co-infection by
multiple lineages would result in the allele frequencies of divergent bases to appear as within-host variants and reflect
the proportions of either haplotype. Detecting instances of
co-infection is important in the context of both transmission
and to accurately characterise the within-host mutation rate
(9, 33). To identify possible co-infected samples we compared the site frequency spectrum for each of our samples
with all of the consensus genomes in the COG-UK dataset
at the end of May 2020. A linear model was used to identify mixtures of two consensus genomes that could explain
the allele frequencies of variants within a sample better than
a single consensus genome. Additional mixtures were considered if two consensus genomes could explain at least two
additional within-host variants over that of a single consensus
genome. In this case the additional consensus genome was
restricted to have at most one variant that was not found in
the sample. Samples identified by the model as being a posTonkin-Hill et al.

with a representative example shown in Figure 6A. The frequencies of within-host variants of all 36 samples, along with
consensus genomes that comprise the putative mixture, are
shown in Supplementary Figure 7. To determine the potential impact of co-infections on transmission inference we excluded all 36 samples and re-ran the pairwise transmission
analysis using the transcluster algorithm on the remaining
samples. Figure 6C indicates that the remaining within-host
variants no longer correlate as well with the probability of
direct transmission, suggesting that much of the correlation
observed previously was potentially driven by co-infections.
It has been suggested that correlations between co-infections

and the consensus phylogeny could be driven by the cotransmission of multiple strains (3). However, as the transmission signal in the minority variants in the remaining
samples has reduced; a more likely explanation is that coinfection of certain strains is driven by multiple episodes
of superinfection (co-infection from two different infection
sources). As these samples and those from the Lythgoe study
were acquired from hospitalised patients, the correspondence
with the consensus phylogeny could then be driven by structured superinfection within hospital COVID-19 wards. The
prevalence of infection within hospitals, particularly during
the first ‘wave’ of the COVID-19 pandemic was often considerably higher than in the community with up to 50% of the

Discussion

D

RA

We find a considerable amount of genetic diversity within individual SARS-CoV-2 infections that cannot be explained by
technical artefacts. This is consistent with the quasispecies
population structure typically found in RNA viruses (5, 37),
including related betacoranaviruses SARS-CoV-1 and MERS
(38, 39). By analysing the frequency of variants within individual samples, we estimate that each viral genome has an
average of 0.72 variants relative to the consensus genome sequence for that sample. Since most of these samples were
probably collected more than a week after the time of infection, and since the SARS-CoV-2 genome is known to acquire
approximately one mutation every two weeks, these findings
are broadly consistent with the hypothesis that within-host
variation is largely due to the accumulation of de novo mutations within the host. Further support for this hypothesis
comes from our analysis of hosts sampled at multiple timepoints, showing that the number of within-host variants tends
to increase during the course of an infection. Increased numbers of within-host variants have also been observed in immunocompromised patients: consistent with the acquisition
of de novo mutations within the host (40).
These data show that within-host variants have a similar
mutational spectrum to major variants that define betweenhost variation. Both are characterised by clear purifying
selection, as would be expected if virions with disadvantageous mutations failed to survive or propagate within the
host. Strikingly, the mutational spectrum of SARS-CoV-2
exhibits a near complete asymmetry between the plus and minus strands, and is dominated by C>U and G>U mutations.
This seems consistent with RNA-damage or RNA-editing of
the plus strand. Whilst mutagenesis by APOBEC enzymes
could play a role, the spectrum we observe is very different
to that seen in human cells. Instead, direct damage of cytosine and guanine bases could also be consistent with the
observed spectrum. Many of the within-host variants that we
have identified are shared between infected individuals located on distant branches of the consensus phylogeny, and
this is congruent with previous reports that the SARS-CoV-

2 consensus phylogeny has many homoplasies that also appear as within-host variants (3). It appears likely that this is
largely due to recurrent mutation although co-infection between lineages could also be a relevant factor in high transmission settings. The vast majority of our samples appear
to comprise a single lineage but we find evidence of putative co-infection by multiple lineages in approximately 3-4%
of samples, which is likely an underestimate of the extent of
co-infection in our dataset.
In other viral and bacterial diseases, within-host variants
provide a valuable source of information for the inference
of transmission chains (33, 41–43) and have been shown
to improve the accuracy of inferences based on consensus
genomes (44–47). In the case of SARS-CoV-2, Lythgoe and
colleagues have reported a geographical structure to the sharing of within-host variants, and have proposed that this might
be explained by localised episodes of superinfection (where
an individual acquires infection from multiple sources) and
subsequent co-transmission of multiple lineages and their recombinants through the local host population (3). We find
some evidence of a correlation between sharing of withinhost variants and the probability of direct transmission, a signal that we find is partially driven by co-infection, but the
current dataset lacks the epidemiological resolution to evaluate the utility of this in reconstructing transmission chains,
which might depend on the prevalence of infection and other
local circumstances such as superinfection within COVID-19
hospital wards.
In summary, these data show that much of the genetic diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 viral population resides within individual hosts. Within-host diversity is generated by the accumulation of de novo mutations during the course of infection
but can also result from co-infection with different lineages.
Analysis of within-host variation could potentially be used
to improve the inference of transmission chains, but this approach requires caution because of the confounding effects of
recurrent mutation and unrelated episodes of superinfection.
More detailed studies are required to evaluate the transmission bottlenecks that govern the propagation of within-host
variants from host to host, and to examine the patterns of
within-host variation associated with different epidemiological circumstances.

approximately 6% of the UK population had been infected
with SARS-CoV-2 by the end of June, 2020 (35). Within
hospital transmission was also common in the early stages of
the outbreak in Wuhan with 41% of 138 patients were found
to have contracted SARS-CoV-2 in hospital (36). While it
is not possible to rule out cross-contamination between samples, this contamination would have to be structured to explain the correlations between the inferred co-infections and
the consensus phylogeny. Batch effects were carefully controlled for by Lythgoe et al., and as we identified a similar
signal using an independent dataset with samples sequenced
in replicate, structured superinfection provides a better explanation. In cases of higher prevalence, repeated episodes
of superinfection rather than co-transmission could complicate the use of within-host minority variants in transmission
inference (Figure 6D).

Methods
Sample selection and ethics. The 1,181 samples were

taken as a random subset from a larger prospective study into
SARS-CoV-2 infections at Cambridge University Hospitals
National Health Service Foundation Trust (CUH; Cambridge,
UK), a secondary care provider and tertiary referral centre in
the East of England (4, 48). This study was done as part of
surveillance for COVID-19 under the auspices of Section 251
of the National Health Service Act 2006. It therefore did not
require individual patient consent or ethical approval. The
COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) study protocol was approved by the Public Health England Research Ethics Governance Group.

waterML, which is available as part of the deepSNV R package (11, 12). In order to create a base-specific error model for
the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we randomly selected sequencing
data from 100 samples (50 from each set of duplicates) from
the 468 samples that met the following criteria: (1) ρ value
from beta-binomial model ≤ 0.02; (2) proportion of genome
with at least 500× coverage ≥ 0.9 for both duplicates; (3)
absolute difference in median coverage between replicates
≤ 20, 000; and (4) only one sample sequenced from a given

were set as uninformative (i.e. depth for all base types were
set to 0) in order to enable calling of recurrent, high VAF
mutations. However, two sites (11074 and 25202) were effectively excluded from variant calling as they were set as
uninformative for all samples in the normal panel.
Variants were called separately for each set of duplicates.

Mutational spectrum. The mutational spectra shown in

Figure 1 were generated assuming that the allele in
the reference sequence (SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1,

mutation rates (r) for each of the 192 possible changes (j) in
a trinucleotide context were calculated as:
rj =

P

Where nj is the total number of mutations observed for a
trinucleotide change j, and Lj is the total number of times
that the corresponding trinucleotide is present in the reference genome (MN908947.3). When observing the same mutation in multiple samples, it is not always straightforward
to determine the number of independent mutational events
that this represents. For major variants, this can be better estimated using a phylogeny, although recurrent hotspots can
cause errors in the phylogenetic reconstruction. For simplicity, mutations observed across samples as major variants were
counted only once for the estimation of nj . For within-host
variants, a more relaxed approach was used since, based on
our results, multiple instances of the same within-host variant across samples are more likely to represent independent
events. Within-host variants observed in more than 5 samples
were only counted 5 times for the calculation of nj , to avoid
a small number of highly-recurrent hotspots from dominating
the trinucleotide spectrum.

tify the level of discordance in the allele frequencies between
technical replicates, for each pair replicates we first identified a set of variable sites, which are expected to contain both
artefacts and within-host mutations. All non-reference variable sites with coverage in both replicates > 100x and mean
VAF from both replicates higher than 1% and lower than 90%
were considered for the beta-binomial modelling. In Illumina sequencing protocols where adapters are ligated before
amplification and PCR duplicates can be removed computationally, VAFs may be expected to show binomial variation
between technical replicates. However, amplicon sequencing can lead to preferential amplification of some molecules
leading to higher variation in VAFs. We quantified the extent
of variation above binomial sampling in the VAFs of variable
sites between replicates by fitting a beta-binomial model to
the allele counts of variable sites, obtaining a maximum likelihood estimate of the ρ (overdispersion) parameter for each
pair of replicate samples. Let x1,j and x2,j be the alternative
(non-reference) allele counts of variable site j in replicates
1 and 2 of a given sample, and n1,j and n2,j be the local
coverages at the site. We can calculate an approximate likelihood for the beta-binomial model using the following equation, where P depicts the beta-binomial density function:

Selection analysis. Analyses of selection were carried out

using the dNdScv package (28). In contrast to traditional implementations of dN/dS developed for divergent sequences,
which rely on Markov-chain codon substitution models (49),
dNdScv was developed for comparisons of closely related
genomes. Under low divergence rates, such as those in the
densely sampled SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny, observed changes
typically represent individual mutational events, which can
be modelled using a Poisson framework instead of Markovchain substitution models. This enables the use of more
complex and realistic substitution models, including context
dependence, strand asymmetry, non-equilibrium sequence
composition and separate estimation of dN/dS ratios for missense and nonsense mutations. These changes can be important to avoid false signals of negative or positive selection
under neutrality when using simplistic substitution models
(28). Here we used the default substitution model in dNdScv, which uses 192 rate parameters to model all possible
mutations in both strands separately in a trinucleotide context, as well as two ω parameters to estimate dN/dS ratios for

genomes for each replicate were generated using the
ARCTIC SARS-CoV-2 bioinformatics pipeline. A multiple
sequence alignment was generated using MAFFTv7.464 and
any sites that were discordant between replicates were set to
be ambiguous (52). Sites that have previously been identified
to create difficulties in generating phylogenies were masked
using bedtools v2.29.2 using the VCF described in De Maio
et al, 2020 (30, 53). Fasttree v2.1.11 was used to generate a
maximum likelihood phylogeny (54).

were only considered if both replicates produced high quality consensus genomes. When multiple samples from the
same host were available the earliest sample was used. Pairwise SNP distances were generated between the consensus
genomes using pairsnp v0.2.0 (55). The distribution of the
underlying number of intermediate transmission events between each pair of samples was then inferred using an implementation of the transcluster algorithm (32, 56). The serial
interval and evolutionary rate were set to 5 days and 1e-3
substitutions/site/year (26, 57).

time dependent (50), providing weaker signals of selection
for more recent changes, and because dN/dS ratios can behave non-monotonically with respect to selection coefficients
under idealised conditions of free recombination when using nucleotide diversity within a population (51). The latter
can result from strong positive selection causing a reduction
in the effective population size (and in nucleotide diversity)
of non-synonymous sites under free recombination. However, the potential loss of monotonicity should not be a concern in our analyses of SARS-CoV-2 data. This is both because free recombination between adjacent sites is unrealistic
for SARS-CoV-2 and because collections of mutations were
identified by comparison of derived sequences to an ancestral
reference genome, instead of by comparison of two derived
sequences at any one time.

Identification of potential mixed infections. Potential
mixed infections were identified using a linear model by testing whether the allele frequencies in a sample could be better
explained by the inclusion of an additional consensus genome
from the COG-UK dataset of the 29th May 2020. Additional
samples mixtures were considered if the addition of a COGUK consensus genome could explain at least 2 iSNVs and
have at most 1 variant that was not found in the alleles of
the sample. This identified 54 putative mixtures which were
then screened manually to obtain 36 potentially mixed samples. The code used to run this analysis is available in the
supplementary materials.
