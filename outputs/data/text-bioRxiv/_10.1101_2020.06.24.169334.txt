Summary
Heparan sulfate (HS) is a cell surface polysaccharide recently identified as a co-receptor with the
ACE2 protein for recognition of the S1 spike protein on SARS-CoV-2 virus, providing a tractable
new target for therapeutic intervention. Clinically-used heparins demonstrate inhibitory activity,
but world supplies are limited, necessitating alternative solutions. Synthetic HS mimetic pixatimod
is a drug candidate for cancer with immunomodulatory and heparanase-inhibiting properties. Here
we show that pixatimod binds to and destabilizes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding
domain (S1-RBD), and directly inhibits its binding to human ACE2, consistent with molecular
modelling identification of multiple molecular contacts and overlapping pixatimod and ACE2
binding sites. Assays with multiple clinical isolates of live SARS-CoV-2 virus show that pixatimod
potently inhibits infection of monkey Vero E6 and human bronchial epithelial cells at
concentrations within its safe therapeutic dose range. Furthermore, in a K18-hACE2 mouse model
pixatimod demonstrates that pixatimod markedly attenuates SARS-CoV-2 viral titer and COVID19-like symptoms. This demonstration of potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity establishes proof-ofconcept for targeting the HS-Spike protein-ACE2 axis with synthetic HS mimetics. Together with
other known activities of pixatimod our data provides a strong rationale for its clinical investigation
as a potential multimodal therapeutic to address the COVID-19 pandemic.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has according to the World Health Organisation recently
surpassed 110 million cases and 2.4 million deaths world-wide. Although vaccines against COVID19 are currently being developed and deployed, given the severe pathophysiology induced by
SARS-CoV-2 (1), there is a clear need for therapeutic alternatives to alleviate and stop the COVID19 epidemic that complement vaccination campaigns. Heparan sulfate (HS) is a highly sulfated
glycosaminoglycan found on the surface of most mammalian cells which is used by many viruses
as an entry receptor or co-receptor (2), including coronaviruses (3). Various compounds that mimic
cellular HS such as clinically-used heparins have been investigated and have been shown to block
infectivity and cell-to-cell spread in a multitude of different viruses, including SARS-associated
coronavirus strain HSR1 (4). The glycosylated spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates host cell
infection via binding to a receptor protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (5). Analysis
of the sequence and experimentally determined structures of the S protein reveals that the receptor
binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit contains a HS binding site. Recent studies have clearly
demonstrated binding of heparin and HS to S1 RBD (6-9), including induction of significant
conformational change in the S1 RBD structure (6), and also revealed that HS is a co-receptor with
ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 (10). Collectively these data strongly suggest that blocking these

interactions with heparins and HS mimetics has potential as an effective strategy for COVID-19
therapy. Although heparins have major potential for repurposing for such applications, limitations
in the global supply of natural product heparins will greatly restrict its availability (11), highlighting
an urgent need to find synthetic alternatives.

Pixatimod (PG545) is a clinical-stage HS mimetic with potent anti-cancer (12,13), and antiinflammatory properties (14). However, significant antiviral and virucidal activity for pixatimod
has also been reported against a number of viruses that use HS as an entry receptor with EC50’s
ranging from 0.06 to 14 µg/mL. This includes HSV-2 (15), HIV (16), RSV (17), Ross River,
Barmah Forest, Asian CHIK and chikungunya viruses (18), and Dengue virus (19). In vivo efficacy
has been confirmed in a prophylactic mouse HSV-2 genital infection model (15), a prophylactic
Ross River virus mouse model (18) and a therapeutic Dengue virus mouse model (19). Pixatimod
has been evaluated in a Phase Ia clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumours where it
demonstrated a tolerable safety profile and some evidence of disease control (13). It has been safely
administered to over 80 cancer patients in Phase I studies as a monotherapy or in combination with
nivolumab (NCT02042781 and ACTRN12617001573347), prompting us to examine its anti-viral
activity against SARS-CoV-2.

Here we provide evidence of a direct and destabilizing interaction of pixatimod with the S1 spike
protein RBD, supported by molecular modelling data. Additionally, pixatimod was able to inhibit
the interaction of S1-RBD with ACE2 and also Vero cells which are known to express the ACE2
receptor, indicating a direct mechanism of action. We established that pixatimod is a potent
inhibitor of attachment and invasion of Vero cells and human bronchial epithelial cells by multiple
clinical isolates of live SARS-CoV-2 virus, and reduces its cytopathic effect, at concentrations
within the known therapeutic range of this drug. Finally, we observed marked attenuation of SARSCoV-2 viral RNA load and COVID-19-like symptoms in the K18-hACE2 mouse model of
infection. Our data demonstrate that synthetic HS mimetics can target the HS-Spike protein-ACE2
axis to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. They provide strong support for clinical investigation of the
potential of pixatimod as a novel therapeutic intervention for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID19, and have implications for wider applications against other HS-binding viruses and emerging
global viral threats.

Modelling of pixatimod-spike protein interactions
We initially used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to map the potential binding sites of
pixatimod (Fig 1A) on the S1 RBD surface (Fig 1B) of monomeric spike. A total of 24 unique
residues of RBD are known to interact with ACE2 based on the X-ray structures (Fig 1B).
Interestingly, a few of these residues (Tyr489, Phe456, Leu455, Ala475) are also predicted to be
involved in binding to pixatimod. Amino acids making significant interactions with pixatimod were
identified on the basis of their individual contributions to the total interaction energy, considering
only the residues that contribute less than -1.0 kcal/mol. The decomposition approach was helpful
for locating residues of the RBD domain such as Lys458, Ser459, Lys462 and Asn481 that
transiently interact to form hydrogen bonds or ionic interactions with the sulfated tetrasaccharide
moiety of pixatimod (Fig 1D). The free energy of binding is -10 kcal/mol, wherein van der Waals
energies make the major favourable contribution to the total free energy. The cholestanol residue
also formed stabilizing interactions with Tyr489, Phe456, Tyr473, Ala475, Gln474 and Leu455
(Fig 1E). Furthermore, the standard deviation of backbone RMSD around residues Leu455-Pro491
and the N-terminal of RBD (Thr333-Thr345) among the four repeated MD trajectories were
approximately 2Å, indicating significant conformational change in the region. RMSF calculations
of main-chain atoms showed significant atomic fluctuations (≥1.5 Å) for Lys458, Asn460, Lys462,
Arg466, Ser477 and Asn481 upon binding to the ligand pixatimod. These results indicate that a
conformational change may be induced by binding of pixatimod to S1 RBD (Fig 1C).

An alternate heparin binding site is reported around residues Arg403, Arg406, Arg408, Gln409,
Lys417, Gln493, Gln498 (8). One of the replicates indicated a second binding mode wherein the
tetrasaccharide of pixatimod was found to interact around this region (Supplementary Materials,
Fig S1), however, the free energy of binding was > +13 kcal/mol indicating much less favourable
binding to this site. Overall, our modelling data strongly support the notion of direct binding of
pixatimod via multiple amino acid contacts in S1 RBD, potentially resulting in induction of a
conformational change and interference with binding to ACE2.

Pixatimod interacts with spike protein
Spectroscopic studies with circular dichroism (CD) were undertaken to investigate direct binding
of pixatimod to recombinant spike protein receptor binding domain (S1 RBD) (Fig 2A,B), the
region which interacts with the ACE2 receptor on human cells. CD spectroscopy in the far UV
region (λ = 190 - 260 nm) detects conformational changes in protein secondary structure that occur
in solution and can infer binding by an added ligand. Such secondary structural changes can be
quantified using spectral deconvolution. SARS-CoV-2 EcS1-RBD (produced in E. coli, see
Methods) underwent conformational change in the presence of either pixatimod or heparin as a
comparator sulfated molecule known to bind the RBD (6-10), consisting of decreased α-helical
content for pixatimod and increased α-helical content for heparin (Fig 2C). A decrease in global βsheet content is observed for both pixatimod and heparin, along with increases in turn structure (Fig
2C).

We explored the effects of pixatimod on protein stability using differential scanning fluorimetry
(DSF) in which the thermal denaturation of a protein is monitored in the presence of a hydrophobic
fluorescent dye (20). Binding of pixatimod induced a notably large reduction in melting temperature
(DTm) of 9.1oC (Fig 2D; p=0.0001), indicating major destabilisation of the mammalian expressed
S1-RBD (mS1 RBD) protein. In contrast, heparin at an equivalent dose only partially destabilised
the RBD protein, evidenced by a small side peak shifted by ~5-6oC indicating populations of RBD
in a bound and unbound state (Fig 2D).
The observed changes demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD interacts with pixatimod in
aqueous conditions of physiological relevance. Notably, the conformational changes and
destabilization observed were distinct for pixatimod compared to heparin, suggesting distinct
interactions (Fig 2). Consistent with the modelling results, these data confirm direct interactions of
pixatimod with S1 RBD, resulting in induction of a conformational change, consistent with the
notion that HS mimetics such as pixatimod have the potential to interfere with S1-RBD interactions
with ACE2.

Pixatimod inhibits S1-RBD cell-binding
We next evaluated inhibition of binding of His-tagged EcS1-RBD to monkey Vero cells (which are
known to express both HS proteoglycans (HSPGs) and the ACE2 protein receptor required for
SARS-CoV-2 attachment and cell invasion). Fixed cells were exposed to His-tagged S1 RBD for
1hr, in the presence or absence of additional compounds, with subsequent washing and detection
using a fluorescently-labelled anti-His tag antibody. A clear dose response was noted for both
pixatimod and heparin as a comparator compound (Fig 2E), with 32% and 51% inhibition achieved
at 100 µg/mL respectively. These data confirm that pixatimod can interfere with binding of S1RBD to cells containing HSPGs and ACE2 protein receptors.
Pixatimod directly inhibits S1-RBD binding to ACE2
To further evaluate the mechanism of action of pixatimod its direct effects on the interaction of S1RBD with the ACE2 protein receptor was measured using a competitive ELISA assay. Inhibition
of binding of mS1-RBD preincubated with various concentrations of inhibitor compounds was
measured by detection with an anti-RBD antibody. A dose response was observed with pixatimod
showing an IC50 of 10.1 µg/ml (Fig 2F). In comparison heparin also demonstrated inhibitory
activity but with lower potency (24.6 µg/ml; Fig 2F). Importantly, this data confirms a direct
mechanism of action of pixatimod via inhibition of S1-RBD binding to the ACE2 protein receptor.

Pixatimod inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection
The effect of pixatimod on SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cells was examined using a standard
plaque reduction neutralisation assay. Pixatimod was pre-incubated with the SARS-CoV-2 clinical
isolate from Victoria, Australia (VIC01) for 1 hr before infecting the cells. Significant decreases
were observed in the number of PFU after pixatimod treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 3A). Analysis
of multiple dose response curves yielded an EC50 for pixatimod in the range of 2.4-13.8 µg/mL
(mean 8.1 µg/ml; n=3 assays) (Table 1). In comparison, an EC50 of ~10 µg/ml has been observed
for unfractionated heparin with a SARS-CoV-2 Italy UniSR1/2020 isolate (8) and 20-64 µg/ml for
the SARS-CoV-2 VIC01 isolate (21).

To establish that these antiviral effects were relevant for wider clinical viral isolates, assays were
conducted with the isolate DE-Gbg20 from Sweden in a plaque reduction assay. Pixatimod
inhibited infectivity of the DE-Gbg20 isolate with an EC50 value of 2.7 µg/mL (Fig 3B), similar to
that found in experiments with the VIC01 isolate. Analysis of pixatimod cytotoxicity for Vero cells
using a tetrazolium-based assay revealed that pixatimod decreased by 50% (CC50) the viability of
Vero cells at concentration >236 µg/mL, i.e., well above the EC50 values observed in the plaque
reduction assay (Fig. 3B; Table 1). Selectivity index (SI) values for pixatimod ranged from >17 to
>98 for these assays.

In addition to the plaque reduction assays pixatimod inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was
assessed using assays that measured the cytopathic effects of the virus as an endpoint. Using the
Swedish DE-Gbg20 isolate, and two Australian isolates from Queensland (QLD02 and QLD935),
the EC50 values for pixatimod inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity were determined to be 0.811.6, 13.2 and 0.9 µg/mL, respectively (Table 1), values comparable with those observed for the
plaque reduction assays (Table 1). We also noted that a pixatimod analogue octyl b-maltotetraoside
tridecasulfate (without the steroid side-chain) (Fig S2) lacked efficacy for both QLD02 and
QLD935 isolates (Fig 3C), demonstrating the importance of the steroid side-chain for activity, and
supporting the notion of the sterol moiety promoting RBD switching position and enhancing
availability of the heparin binding site. Notably, both DE-Gbg20 and QLD935 isolates contain the
D614G mutation of the spike protein commonly present in recent isolates (Table S1) (22). The
QLD935 isolate exhibited lower cytopathicity, which could partially contribute to the observed
lower EC50 for pixatimod against this isolate.
To provide evidence of antiviral properties of pixatimod in a more physiologically relevant model
for infection of human cells, we used a bronchial airway epithelial in vitro system of SARS-CoV2 infection and replication. The hTERT transformed bronchial epithelial cell line BCi-NS1.1
differentiates into airway multi-ciliated cells when grown in Transwells at the air-liquid interface
(ALI) cultures which show robust infection with SARS-CoV-2 when harvested 72 h after
inoculation (23,24). To validate this model we firstly infected ALI bronchial cultures by adding
SARS-CoV-2 (VIC01, MOI=0.2) on the apical side of the culture system and measured up to 1000

fold increase in viral RNA between 2h and 72h post-infection, measured by RT-PCR of viral RNA
using primers for N2/N3 regions of the N gene of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig S3, panel A). To determine
if pixatimod has inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in this model, the virus
was preincubated with 0.4, 4 or 40 µg/ml of pixatimod (or HBSS for untreated) for 1 hr at 37oC
before the inoculum was added to the apical side of the cells. We examined infectious virus in the
apical wash from BCI ALI cultures by plaque assay on Vero E6 cells. Viral shedding of ALI
cultures infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of 0.4 and 4 µg/ml pixatimod was completely
abolished in comparison to the cells infected with the untreated virus as a control (Fig 3D), whereas
at 40 µg/ml pixatimod resulted in >40 fold reduction in PFU/ml (Fig 3D). To corroborate these
findings viral shedding from the apical side of the culture and viral load in the infected cells was
also measured by RT-PCR. Incubation of SARS-CoV-2 with different concentrations of pixatimod
reduced SARS-CoV-2 shedding from ALI cells into the apical phase by > 98%, and reduced SARSCoV-2 RNA within the cells by >97% at 72hr at all pixatimod doses, compared to untreated infected
cells (Fig S3, panels A & B). Notably, efficacy at 0.4 and 4 µg/ml was >99% in both cases
indicating high potency of pixatimod in inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection of human bronchial
cells. Overall, these data in a physiologically-relevant human bronchial cell model show that
pixatimod is a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 in terms of both lowering viral shedding in the
apical compartment and viral load in the cell layer.

Pixatimod inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo
The potential efficacy of pixatimod in vivo was explored with an established SARS-CoV-2 lethal
infection model using hACE2 transgenic mice wherein hACE2 is expressed behind a keratin 18
promoter (25-28). Virus was inoculated in 50 µl via the intranasal route into the lungs (25-27). A
single prophylactic treatment of 16 mg/kg of pixatimod was given to K18-hACE2 mice one day
before intranasal infection with SARS-CoV-2. Two control groups were included, K18-hACE2
mice that were treated with saline and infected with virus, and C57BL/6J mice given pixatimod but
no virus. Mice were weighed daily and euthanized on day 5 when weight loss approached 20%,
the ethically defined endpoint. As reported previously in other preclinical models of infectious
disease (18,19), pixatimod led to an initial bodyweight loss of 8%. Weight loss was thus presented
relative to day 1 post-infection in order to focus on infection-induced weight loss (Fig. 4A), which
generally occurs after day 3 (26). The mean weight loss for saline-treated K18-hACE2 mice was
significantly higher than for pixatimod treated K18-ACE2 mice (p=0.043, repeat measures
ANOVA including data from days 4 and 5), with the latter showing no significant infectionassociated weight loss (Fig. 4A).

Tissue viral loads were assessed on day 5 post infection, with pixatimod-treated animals showing
a significant 3.1 log10 fold reduction in viral titers in nasal turbinates (p=0.037, Kolmogorov
Smirnov test, non-parametric data distribution), and a 4.6 log10 fold reduction in viral titers in brain,
which approached significance (p=0.0588, t test, parametric data distribution). Viral titers in the
lungs were not significantly affected by pixatimod treatment (Fig 4B). In view of the robust nature
of this model, with rapid effects such as massive weight loss and high level of lethality, these data
indicate a remarkable prophylactic anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of pixatimod.

Discussion
The current COVID-19 pandemic illustrates the critical need to develop both effective vaccines and
therapeutics for emerging viruses; established antiviral agents appear to have limited utility against
SARS-CoV-2. Owing to their use as a means of cell attachment by many viruses, HS represents an
ideal broad-spectrum antiviral target (2). Binding of a viral protein to cell-surface HS is often the
first step in a cascade of interactions that is required for viral entry and the initiation of infection
(29). As HS and heparin contain the same saccharide building blocks and HS-binding proteins also
interact with heparin, this drug is gaining attention beyond its anticoagulant properties in COVID19 treatment (29). Here we demonstrate a direct mechanism of action of pixatimod on attenuating
S1-RBD binding to ACE2. These data are supported by recent studies on heparin using native mass
spectrometry (30), and also reveal for the first time the ability of HS mimetics to inhibit S1-RBD
binding to ACE2.

Heparin has been shown to inhibit binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to a human cell line (31),
and to inhibit entry into human cells of pseudovirus carrying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
(10,32). However, the question of whether therapeutic doses of heparins are effective for COVID19 patients as an antiviral treatment awaits the outcome of clinical trials; bleeding complications
are possible (33), though non-anticoagulant heparin or HS preparations could be deployed that
reduce cell binding and infectivity without a risk of causing bleeding (9,10). However, HS mimetics
offer additional advantages in comparison to heparin beyond simply reducing anticoagulant activity
(9), most notably their ready availability at scale via synthetic chemistry production that addresses
the well-known fragility of the heparin supply chain (11). As a clinical-stage HS mimetic,
pixatimod provides better control over structure, molecular weight diversity (a single molecular
entity), sulfation, purity and stability. Herein, we reveal a direct interaction of the clinical candidate
pixatimod with the S1 spike protein RBD, supported by molecular modelling data. Pixatimod also
inhibited the interaction of S1 RBD with Vero cells which express the ACE2 receptor. Moreover,
infectivity assays, of two types (plaque reduction and cytopathic effect, Table 1) confirm pixatimod
is a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero cells, at concentrations ranging from 0.8 to

13.8 µg/mL which are well within its known therapeutic range. Interestingly, we noted that the
lipophilic steroid side chain of pixatimod was critical for its potency and is predicted from
modelling to interact with S1-RBD. This unique feature, making it an unusual amphiphilic HS
mimetic, has also been shown to confer virucidal activity against Herpes Simplex virus by
disruption of the viral lipid envelope (15).

Pixatimod has only mild anti-coagulant activity, and has been administered i.v. to over 80 cancer
patients, being well tolerated with predictable pharmacokinetics (PK) and no reports of heparininduced thrombocytopenia (12). Further, cytotoxicity in vitro is low; we observed a CC50 >100
µM (>236 µg/mL) in Vero cells, consistent with cytotoxicity data on human cells (34). Importantly,
the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of pixatimod following a single treatment of 100 mg
in cancer patients is 29.5 µg/mL with a Cmin of 2.7 µg/mL measured one week following treatment
(12), indicating that an equivalent dosing regimen should be sufficient to achieve antiviral activity
in human subjects. The low anticoagulant activity of pixatimod is an advantage since it could be
used as a direct antiviral agent in combination therapies with heparins, which are being used to treat
coagulopathies observed in COVID-19 patients (35). It was also encouraging that pixatimod
inhibition of multiple clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 was noted, demonstrating potential for
widespread effectiveness. The presence of multiple binding sites for pixatimod in the Spike protein
would suggest robustness against mutations that may arise later in pandemic and/or in the following
coronavirus outbreaks. While recent widespread isolates with D614G spike mutants appear to be
2-3 fold more sensitive to the antiviral activity of pixatimod, caution needs to be taken in
interpreting the data of the cytopathicity assay used to determine this activity as G614 isolates (at
least QLD935) exhibited lower cytopathicity than D614 isolates.

Since SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly a respiratory infection, our data from human bronchial cells
are directly supportive of high potency of pixatimod against infection of clinically relevant human
cells. Further, the potential efficacy in humans is supported by our initial data from the established
K18 hACE2 transgenic mouse model which demonstrated the ability to rescue the dramatic weight
loss phenotype observed. Given the half-life of pixatimod in mice is 38h (34), compared to 141h in
human (13), future studies should adopt repeat-dose schedules to identify the optimal schedule in
models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also suggest that direct intranasal delivery of pixatimod
would be worth investigation, in view of recent positive data on the delivery of nebulized heparin
for treatment of ARDS (36) which has significance for potential application of heparin in COVID19 treatment (21).

Why Pixatimod should have such a dramatic effect in nasal turbinates and brain, but not lungs in
the K18 hACE2 model is unclear but may reflect very high lung (supra-physiological) K18-driven
hACE2 receptor expression in the lungs in this model (27) and/or pharmacokinetics (34).
Nevertheless the results are encouraging, as the initial infection in humans occurs in the upper
respiratory tract, with ARDS developing only after infection has over time spread down into the
lungs (37). This progression is not recapitulated in the mouse model where fulminant lung infection
requires direct inoculation of virus into the lungs via the intranasal route. Infection of the brain
may occur via the olfactory epithelium (38) so the reduced infection of brain may reflect the reduced
infection of nasal turbinates. Although CNS involvement in COVID-19 in humans is now well

It is notable that there are multiple potential mechanisms of action of pixatimod against SARSCoV-2 (summarised in Fig 5), including direct inhibition of HS-Spike-ACE2 interactions via
complex and multiple interactions with amino acids in RBD. Notably, the latter contrasts with the
more restricted epitopes typical of antibodies which are observed to be subject to mutational escape
potentially requiring vaccine redesign or use of multivalent strategies (39). In this respect we
speculate that heparin mimetics like pixatimod may prove important therapeutic tools for initial
responses to escape variants. Beyond this. pixatimod also has immunomodulatory effects which
may alleviate some of the immunopathologies associated with moderate-severe COVID-19 disease.
Pixatimod also inhibits the pro-inflammatory enzyme heparanase (34) and has been demonstrated
to suppress IL-6 in inflammatory (pancreatitis) and viral (Ross River virus) animal models (14, 18).
Moreover, it blocks the heparanase-dependent invasion of macrophages into tumours in mouse
cancer models (35) which may be relevant to invasion of monocytes and macrophages into the
lungs associated with severe COVID-19 disease (40). Vaccinia virus has recently been shown to
rely on host heparanase to degrade HS in order to spread to distant sites (41), revealing a role for
heparanase in the progression of disease that may also apply for SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19.
Notably, increased plasma heparanase activity is associated with COVID-19 (42). Thus multiple
additional beneficial effects of pixatimod might be anticipated from its heparanase inhibitory
properties.

Based on the data presented here, pixatimod has potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 at
therapeutically relevant concentrations both in vitro and in vivo, and against relevant human
bronchial cells. These activities are in addition to the known heparanase-inhibitory and
immunomodulatory properties of pixatimod which may further support the host response to
COVID-19 infection. Collectively this provides a strong rationale to justify entry of pixatimod into
clinical trials for COVID-19. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the first proof-of-concept for
employing HS mimetics against SARS-CoV-2 with implications for wider future applications of
this class of broad-spectrum antivirals, potentially against SARS-CoV-2 escape variants, other HSbinding viruses and also those that may emerge as future global threats.

Figure 5: Proposed multi-modal mechanisms of pixatimod activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. The
principal mode of action demonstrated here is that pixatimod acts as a decoy receptor1, blocking S1-RBD binding to
HS co-receptors and inhibiting viral attachment to host cells, thus blocking viral infection. Additional potential modes
of action include: [2] virucidal activity of pixatimod, dependent upon the cholestanol moiety15, which may lead to
degradation and permanent inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 virus particles; [3] suppression of IL-6 secretion by antigen
presenting cells, primarily macrophages14; and [4] blocking viral escape from host cells by inhibiting heparanase which
otherwise promotes viral escape by cleaving HS receptors41,42.

Materials and Methods
Computational methods: The crystal structure of the RBD-ACE2 complex (PDB ID: 6LZG) was
retrieved from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. Structures were stripped of water molecules, ACE2
chain and any cofactors and/or ligands present. UCSF Chimera was used to edit the structure and
for visualisation. Without prior knowledge of the pixatimod binding site, one molecule of the ligand
was placed in the simulation system containing the protein, solvent and ions and molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations were performed for 600 ns using the AMBER16 package. Such
unguided simulations, as reviewed before (43), have been used to predict the binding sites on a
protein’s surface and drive the design of new ligands. All the MD simulations were carried out
using the pmemd.cuda module (44) of the AMBER 16 molecular dynamics package and the
analyses were performed using the cpptraj module of AmberTools16 (45). Simulation systems were
set up by placing the spike RBD domain at the centre of the octahedral simulation box (with an
extension of at least 12 Å from each side). Pixatimod was randomly placed in the box. This was
followed by addition of TIP3P water (46) and Na+ ions for neutralising the charge of the system.
Proteins were parameterized using the Amber99SB-ildn force field (47) whereas Glycam-06

(version j) (48) and Lipid14 (49) force fields were used for the sulfated tetrasaccharide and
cholestanol moieties of pixatimod, respectively. Four replicates of the unguided simulations were
performed (4 × 600 ns). Periodic boundary conditions were applied, and the time step was set to 2
fs. The electrostatic energy was calculated with the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method. SHAKE
constraints were applied on the bonds involving hydrogen. A cut-off of 12 Å was applied to the
Lennard-Jones and direct space electrostatic interactions with a uniform density approximation
included to correct for the long-range van der Waals interactions.
The system was first minimized without electrostatics for 500 steps, then with a restraint of 25
kcal/(mol Å2) applied on the protein and pixatimod. This minimization was followed by 100‐ps
MD simulation with 25 kcal/(mol Å2) positional restraints applied on the protein and ligand, and
the temperature was slowly increased from 0 to 300 K. Then, followed by 500 steps of steepest
descent cycles followed by 500 steps of conjugate gradient minimization, and 50‐ps equilibrations
with a restraint force constant of 5 kcal/(mol Å2) in the protein and ligand, followed by final 2 ns
equilibration without restraints to equilibrate the density. The first few steps were all carried out at
constant volume followed by at least 600 ns production MD simulation at 300 K (Langevin
dynamics, collision frequency: 5/ps) with 1‐atm constant pressure. Trajectories were collected and
data analyses such as RMSD, RMSF and free energy of binding were performed on the last 30000
frames. The binding free energy and pairwise residue contributions (50) were calculated using the
Molecular mechanics-Generalized Born (GB) equation (MM/GBSA) procedure implemented in
AmberTools16. The details of this method have been extensively reviewed (51). The polar
solvation energy contribution was calculated by using GBOBC II (igb= 5) (52). The value of the
implicit solvent dielectric constant and the solute dielectric constant for GB calculations was set to
80 and 1, respectively. The solvent probe radius was set to 1.4 Å as default. The entropy calculation
is computationally expensive and therefore not performed for the purposes of this study.
Expression of His-tagged recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD in E. coli: Residues 330−583 of
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (GenBank: MN908947) were cloned upstream of a N-terminal

Austin. Briefly, 100 mL of HEK293-6E cells were seeded at a cell density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml
24hr before transfection with polyethyleneimine (PEI). For transfection, 100 μg of the ACE2
plasmid and 300 μg of PEI (1:3 ratio) were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Transfected
cells were cultured for 48 hr and fed with 100 mL fresh media for additional 48 hr before harvest.
RBD-SD1was puriﬁed by HiTrap Protein G HP column (GE Healthcare, US) pre-equilibrated in
PBS and eluted with 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.7). Purity of proteins was evaluated by Coomassie staining
of SDS-PAGE gels, and proteins were quantiﬁed by BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc).
Secondary structure determination of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD by circular dichroism spectroscopy:
The circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD in PBS was recorded using a
J-1500 Jasco CD spectrometer (Jasco, UK), Spectral Manager II software (JASCO, UK) using a
0.2 mm path length, quartz cuvette (Hellma, USA). All spectra were obtained using a scanning of
100 nm/min, with 1 nm resolution throughout the range λ = 190 - 260 nm and are presented as the
the mean of five independent scans, following instrument calibration with camphorsulfonic acid.
SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD was buffer-exchanged (prior to spectral analysis) using a 10 kDa Vivaspin
centrifugal filter (Sartorius, Germany) at 12,000 g, thrice and CD spectra were collected using 21
μL of a 0.6 mg/mL solution in PBS, pH 7.4. Spectra of heparin (unfractionated porcine mucosal
heparin, Celsus) were collected in the same buffer at approximately comparable concentrations,
since this is a polydisperse material. Collected data were analysed with Spectral Manager II
software prior to processing with GraphPad Prism 7, using second order polynomial smoothing
through 21 neighbours. Secondary structural prediction was calculated using the BeStSel analysis
server (53).
To ensure that the CD spectral change of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD in the presence of pixatimod did
not arise from the addition of the compound alone, a difference spectrum was analysed. The
theoretical CD spectrum that resulted from the arithmetic addition of the CD spectrum of the SARSCoV-2 S1 RBD and that of pixatimod differed from the observed experimental CD spectrum of
SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD mixed with compound alone. This demonstrates that the change in the CD
spectrum arose from a conformational change following binding to pixatimod (Supplementary
Materials, Fig S3).
Differential scanning fluorimetry: Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) was conducted on
mammalian expressed mS1-RBD (1 μg) in PBS pH 7.6 and 1.25 X Sypro Orange (Invitrogen) to
a total well volume of 40 μL in 96-well qPCR plates (AB Biosystems). Unfractionated porcine
mucosal heparin (Celsus) or pixatimod (10 μg) were introduced to determine the effect on the
thermal stability of, mS1-RBD using an AB biosystems StepOne plus qPCR machine, employing
the TAMRA filter setting. Melt curve experiments were performed following a 2-minute initial
incubation at 25 °C, with succeeding 0.5 °C increments every 30 s up to a final temperature of
90°C. Control wells containing H2O, heparin or pixatimod (10 μg) without mS1-RBD (1 μg) also
employed to ensure a change in the melt curve was solely a result of protein-ligand interactions and
interactions with Sypro Orange. Smoothed first derivative plots (9 neighbours, 2nd-order
polynomial, Savitxky-Golay) were constructed using Prism 8 (GraphPad). Tm values were
calculated using MatLab softaware (R20018a, MathWorks) and DTm values determined from the
difference between the Tm of RBD alone or in the presence of heparin or pixatimod.

Cell binding of S1 RBD: African green monkey Vero kidney epithelial cells (Vero E6) were
purchased from ATCC. Cells were maintained at 50-75% confluence in DMEM supplemented
with 10% foetal bovine serum, 20 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin-G and 100 U/mL
streptomycin sulfate (all purchased from Gibco/ThermoFisher, UK). Cells were maintained at 37
o
C, in 5% CO2 and plated into 96-well cell culture plates at 1000 cells/well in 100 µL of
maintenance medium. Cells were allowed to adhere overnight. Medium was aspirated and wells
were washed 3x with 200 µL calcium, magnesium-free PBS (CMF-PBS, Lonza, UK). Cells were
fixed with 100 µL 10% neutral buffered Formalin (Thermofisher, UK) for 10 minutes at room
temperature, then washed 3x with 200 µL CMF-PBS. 100 µL CMF-PBS was added to each well
and plates were stored at 4 °C until use. Before use, wells were blocked with 200 µL CMF-PBS +
1% BSA (Sigma-Roche, UK) for 1 hour at room temperature, and washed 3x with 200 µL CMFPBS + 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST, Sigma-Roche, UK) followed by 2x with 200 µL CMF-PBS.
His-tagged S1-RBD (50 µg/mL) and compounds at indicated concentrations were added to each
well in 25 µL PBST + 0.1% BSA as indicated. Wells were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature
with rocking. Wells were washed 3x with 200 µL PBST and 2x with 200 µL CMF-PBS. Binding
of His-tagged S1-RBD was detected with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-his tag antibody (clone J095G46,
Biolegend, UK) 1:5000 in 25 µL PBST + 0.1% BSA per well. Wells were incubated in the dark
for 1 hour at room temperature with rocking. Wells were washed 3x with 200 µL PBST and 2x
with 200 µL CMF-PBS. Fluorescence was read at Ex. 485:Em 535 on a Tecan Infinite M200Pro
plate reader. Results are presented as normalized mean (where 0 is the fluorescence without added
S1-RBD, and 1 is the fluorescence with 50 μg/mL S1-RBD; ± %CV, n=3).

Competition ELISA for S1 RBD binding to ACE2: High binding 96 well plates (Greiner) were
coated with 3 μg/mL streptavidin (Fisher) in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer pH 9.6 (50 μL/ well)
for 1 hour at 37 oC. Plates were washed 3 times with 300 μL PBS, 0.2% Brij35 (PBSB) and blocked
with 300 μL PBSB + 1% casein for 1 hour at 37 oC. Plates were washed a further 3 times with 300
μL PBSB prior to the addition of 100 ng/mL BiotinylatedACE2 (Sino Biological) in PBSB + 1%
casein (50 μL/ well) and incubated for 1 hour at 37 oC. Plates were again washed 3 times with 300
μL PBSB prior to the addition of 50 μL/well mS1-RBD (5μg/mL) in PBSB + 1% casein, which had
been pre-incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with or without varying concentrations of
heparin or pixatimod (100- 0.7 μg/mL) in separate tubes. Plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37 oC
to allow for mS1-RBD-ACE2 binding and were subsequently washed with 300 μL/well PBSB.
Bound mS1-RBD was detected by incubation with 0.5 μg/mL Rabbit-SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV)
Spike RBD Antibody (Stratech) in PBSB + 1% casein (50 μL/well) for 1 hour at 37 oC. Following
a further 3 washes with PBSB plates were incubated for 30 minutes at 37 oC with horseradish
peroxidase conjugated Donkey anti-Rabbit IgG diluted 1:1000, v/v in PBSB + 1% casein
(Bioledgend). Plates were washed a final 5 times with 300 μL PBSB before being developed for 10
minutes with 3,3',5,5'- tetramethylbenzidine prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Fisher). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 μL 2M HsSO4 and plates were read at λ =450
nm using a Tecan Infinate M200 Pro mulit-well plate reader (Tecan Group). Control wells
containing no biotinylated ACE2 were employed to ensure binding was specific.

Live SARS-CoV-2 virus assays: SARS-CoV-2 Victoria isolate (GISAID accession,
EPI_ISL_406844): a plaque reduction assay was performed with the SARS-CoV-2
Victoria/01/2020 (passage 3) isolate, generously provided by The Doherty Institute, Melbourne,
Australia at P1, was diluted to a concentration of 1.4 x 103 pfu/mL (70 pfu/50µL) in minimal
essential media (MEM) (Life Technologies, California, USA) containing 1% (v/v) foetal calf serum
(FCS) (Life Technologies) and 25 mM HEPES buffer (Sigma) and mixed 50:50 with pixatimod
dilutions, in a 96-well V-bottomed plate. The plate was incubated at 37 °C in a humidified box for
1 hour to allow the virus to be exposed to pixatimod. The virus-compound mixture was transferred
onto the wells of a washed 24-well plate that had been seeded with Vero E6 cells
[ECACC 85020206] the previous day at 1.5 x 105 cells/well. The virus-compound mixture was left
to adsorb for an hour at 37°C, then plaque assay overlay media was applied (MEM containing 1.5%
carboxymethylcellulose (Sigma, Dorset, UK), 4% (v/v) FCS and 25 mM HEPES buffer). After
incubation at 37 °C in a humidified box, for 5 days, plates were fixed overnight with 20% (v/v)
formalin/PBS, washed with tap water and then stained with methyl crystal violet solution (0.2%
v/v) (Sigma) and plaques were counted. Compound dilutions were performed in either duplicate or
quadruplicate. Compound dilutions and cells only were run in duplicate, to determine if there was
any cell cytotoxicity. A mid-point probit analysis (written in R programming language for statistical
computing and graphics) was used to determine the amount (μg/mL) required to reduce SARSCoV-2 viral plaques by 50% (PRNT50) compared with the virus only control (n=5). An internal
positive control for the PRNT assay was run in triplicate using a sample of heat-inactivated human
MERS convalescent serum known to neutralise SARS-CoV-2 (National Institute for Biological
Standards and Control, UK).

SARS-CoV-2 DE-Gbg20 isolate (GISAID accession under application): Plaque reduction assay
for SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate DE-Gbg20 from Sweden was performed in a similar manner,
except for the virus and the pixatimod (fivefold decreasing concentrations at a range 100-0.16
µg/ml) were diluted in DMEM supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated FCS, and 100 U of penicillin
and 60 µg/ml of streptomycin (DMEM-S). The virus (100 PFU) and pixatimod (fivefold decreasing
concentrations at a range 100 – 0.16 µg/ml) were mixed and incubated for 30 min in humidified
atmosphere comprising 5% CO2 (CO2 incubator). The mixtures were then transferred to Vero cells
(ATCC CCL-81) and following incubation with cells for 90 min in the CO2 incubator, the
methylcellulose overlay was added. Three separate experiments each with duplicates were
performed.
A cytopathic effect assay was performed with the SARS-CoV-2 DE-Gbg20 isolate and Vero cells
(ATCC) plated at 2 x 104 per well in 96-well plates the day prior to the experiment. Serial fivefold
dilutions of pixatimod in DMEM supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated FCS, and 100 U of
penicillin and 60 µg/mL of streptomycin (DMEM-S) were incubated with 100 TCID50 of SARSCoV-2 isolate DE for 20 min in humidified atmosphere comprising 5% CO2 (CO2 incubator). The
final concentrations of pixatimod were in a range 0.075 µg/mL to 47.2 µg/mL. The cells were
rinsed once with 50 µL of DMEM-S, and then 200 µL of the virus-pixatimod mixtures were added
to each well with cells (in quadruplicates). After incubation of the virus-pixatimod mixtures with
cells for 3 days in the CO2 incubator, the cells were inspected under a microscope for the presence
of virus induced cytopathic effect where complete protection of cells were denoted as “+” while a

SARS-CoV-2 QLD02 (GISAID accession EPI_ISL_407896) and QLD935 (GISAID accession
EPI_ISL_436097) clinical isolates from Australia: A cytopathic effect assay was carried out as
described above for the DE-Gbg20 isolate, with 10 ffu/well and 3 days incubation. In this assay,
Vero E6 cells were plated at 2 x 104 per well in 96-well plates the day prior to experiment. Serial
five-fold dilutions of pixatimod in DMEM supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated FCS, and 100
U of penicillin and 60 µg/mL of streptomycin (DMEM-S) were incubated with 10 foci forming
units of SARS-CoV-2 QLD02 or QLD935 isolate and incubated for 30 min in humidified
atmosphere comprising 5% CO2 (CO2 incubator). The cells were rinsed once with 50 µL of DMEMS, and then 200 µL of the virus-pixatimod mixtures were added to each well with cells (in
triplicates). After incubation of the virus-pixatimod mixtures with cells for 3 days in the CO2
incubator, the cells were fixed with 4% PFA and then stained with crystal violet. Then crystal violet
was released by methanol and OD at 595nm was measured to quantify cell viability (protection
from infection). The EC50 was then calculated using GraphPad Prism.

Cytotoxicity assays: The assay was performed as described previously (17). Briefly, Vero cells
(ATCC, 2 x 104 cells/well) were seeded in 96 well cluster plates to become nearly confluent at the
day of the experiment. The cell growth medium was then removed and 100 µL of serial fivefold
dilutions of pixatimod in DMEM-S (ranging from 0.09 to 236 µg/mL) were added to cells.
Following incubation of cells with pixatimod for 3 days in the CO2 incubator, 20 µL of the MTS
salt containing CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) was added and
incubated for further 1-2 h at 37 °C. The absorbance was recorded at 490 nm against a background
of 650 nm. Two separate experiments each in duplicates were performed and the results are
expressed as percentage of absorbance value detected with pixatimod relative to control cells.
Human bronchial cell infection assays: The hTERT transformed bronchial epithelial cell line BCiNS1.1 (23,24) expanded in PneumaCult-Ex Plus Basal Medium supplemented with Pneumacult Ex
Plus supplements, hydrocortisone, nystatin and penicillin–streptomycin. BCi-NS1.1 cells were
grown at an Air Liquid Interface (ALI) in PneumaCult-ALI Basal Medium supplemented with
Pneumacult ALI supplement hydrocortisone, PneumaCult ALI maintenance supplement, heparin,
nystatin and penicillin–streptomycin (all from Stemcell Technologies) at 37°C in 5% CO2. BCiNS1.1 cell ciliation was observed by microscopy and cells were differentiated and ciliated after 4
to 5 weeks at ALI. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) was monitored weekly using an
EVOM Voltohmmeter (World Precision Instruments) and cells with a TER ≥1000 WΩm2 were
used.
SARS-CoV-2 strain BetaCoV/ Australia/VIC01/2020 was used for infection: 50,000 plaqueforming units (MOI=0.1-0.2, obtained from Public Health England and propagated in Vero E6 cells
for no more than two passages before use) were preincubated with either 4, 40 and 400 µg/ml of
Wockhardt heparin or 0.4, 4 and 40 µug/ml of pixatimod for 1 hr at 37oC in a total volume of 200
µl (or an equivalent volume of saline was added apically in the untreated controls). BCi-NS1.1 cells
(4 to 8 weeks after ALI) after being washed three times with HBSS were apically infected with the
preincubated virus and compounds. After 2h the virus-compound solution was removed from the

assays and 50 µl stored in Qiazol. Similarly at 72 h a further 200 µl HBSS wash was performed and
collected as at 2h. Cells were also harvested with QIAzol (QIAGEN) at 2 h after the HBSS wash
and at 72 h post-infection for RNA extraction.
Plaque assay was performed to quantify extracellular virus released in the supernatant of infected
ALI. Vero E6 cells were seeded at 2.5 x 105 cells/well in a 12-well plate and left for a period of 24
hours in DMEM supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), glutamine and 50 U/ml
penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO2. Cells were washed once with infection medium (serumfree DMEM supplemented with 25 mM HEPES) and 100 µl from washes of infected ALI cultures
added to wells in 10 fold serial dilutions. After a 1 hour incubation at 37℃ in 5% CO2, infectious
supernatants were removed and a 1.5ml overlay of 1 x DMEM supplemented with 4% FBS, 25 mM
HEPES and 0.6% (w/v) cellulose (Sigma; cat no 435244) was added. Plates were incubated at 37°C
and 5% CO2 for 72 hours before removing the overlay, fixing with 8% formaldehyde in PBS, and
staining with 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet in a solution of 20% (v/v) ethanol.
RNA was isolated from cell lysates using standard phenol–chloroform extraction, and reverse
transcribed to cDNA using a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Taqman gene expression assays for N2 and
N3 regions of the SARS-CoV-2 N gene were made (ThermoFisher) following CDC specifications
(Division of Viral Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA, 20 January 2020 copy).
To measure viral shedding in the apical side, gene expression was quantified using the 2–∆Ct method.
For determination of relative changes of RNA within the cells the average Ct values of both SARSCoV-2 N2 and N3 gene RNA were normalised against the house keeping gene B2M and shown as
fold changes compared to the untreated cells using the 2–∆∆Ct method.

K18-hACE2 mouse experiments: Mouse experiments are approved by the QIMR Berghofer MRI
Biosafety Committee and Animal Ethics Committee (project P3600), and are conducted in
accordance with the “Australian Code for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes” as
defined by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia. Work was conducted
in a dedicated suite in a biosafety level-3 (PC3) facility at the QIMR Berghofer MRI (Australian
Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment certification Q2326 and Office of the Gene
Technology Regulator certification 3445). Heterozygous K18 hACE2-transgenic mice (The
Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbour, ME, USA) were bred in-house by crossing with C57BL/6J mice
(Animal Resources Center, Canning Vale, WA, Australia). DNA from tail tips was isolated using
Extract-N-Amp Tissue PCR kit (Sigma) and PCR genotyping undertaken as described (The Jackson
Laboratory. Genotyping protocols database. B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J. Stock No: 034860.

hCoV-19/Australia/QLD02/2020 (QLD02) (GISAID Accession ID; EPI_ISL_407896) virus was
used to inoculate K18 hACE2 mice (n=4 per group) intranasally with 104 CCID50 of virus in 50 μl
medium while under light anaesthesia; 3% isoflurane (Piramal Enterprises Ltd., Andhra Pradesh,

Specialists/Darvall, Gladesville, NSW, Australia). Mice were weighed daily and euthanized on day
5 post-infection using CO2. Tissues were fixed for histology or were weighed and then
homogenised using four ceramic beads at 6000 rpm twice for 15 s (Precellys 24 Homogeniser,
Bertin Instruments, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France). After centrifugation for 30 mins, 2000 g at
4°C, virus titres in supernatants were determined by CCID50 assays using Vero E6 cells.
Statistical analysis: Experimental data are presented as means ± SD, SEM or CV as noted.
Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of a two-tailed Student’s t test with GraphPad
Prism (GraphPad Software) unless otherwise noted. Differences were considered statistically
significant if the P value was less than 0.05. Statistical analysis for the K18-hACE2 mouse work
was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 19.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY,
USA). The t-test was used when the data was deemed parametric, i.e. difference in variances was
<4, skewness was >2 and kurtosis was <2. Otherwise the non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov
test was used.

Figure S1. An alternate binding mode of pixatimod on the S1 RBD presented an unfavourable
total binding free energy. Surfaces are oriented in the same direction as shown in the ribbon
diagram in the inset. (a) Coulombic Surface Coloring defaults: ε = 4r, thresholds ± 10 kcal/mol·e
were used. Blue indicates surface with basic region whereas red indicates negatively charged
surface. (b) The hydrophobic surface was coloured using the Kyte-Doolittle scale wherein blue,
white and orange red colour indicates most hydrophilic, neutral and hydrophobic region,
respectively. UCSF Chimera was used for creating surfaces and rendering the images. Hydrogens
are not shown for clarity.

Figure S3: Pixatimod inhibits infection of human bronchial epithelial cells with SARS-CoV2 virus. Live virus infectivity assays of bronchial airway epithelial cells BCi-NS1.1, grown in an
air liquid interface (ALI), were performed as described in Methods for the SARS-CoV-2 isolate
VIC01. Viral shedding in the apical side (panel A) and viral load in infected cells (panel B) was
measured by RT-PCR of viral RNA, as described in Methods. (representative data shown).

Figure S4: The conformational change of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD observed in the presence
of pixatimod by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. (A). Circular dichroism spectra (190 260 nm) of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD alone (black solid line) and pixatimod (blue solid line) in PBS,
pH 7.4. The red line represents the sum of the two individual spectra. Vertical dotted line indicates
222 nm (B) Details of the same spectra expanded between 200 and 240 nm. Vertical dotted lines
indicate 222 nm and 208 nm.
