Abstract

25

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a positive-sense

26

single stranded RNA virus with high human transmissibility. This study generated

27

Whole Genome data to determine the origin and pattern of transmission of SARS-

28

CoV-2 from the first six cases tested in The Gambia. Total RNA from SARS-CoV-2

29

was extracted from inactivated nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swabs of six cases and

30

converted to cDNA following the ARTIC COVID-19 sequencing protocol. Libraries

31

were constructed with the NEBNext ultra II DNA library prep kit for Illumina and Oxford

32

Nanopore Ligation sequencing kit and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq and Nanopore

33

GridION, respectively. Sequencing reads were mapped to the Wuhan reference

34

genome and compared to eleven other SARS-CoV-2 strains of Asian, European and

35

American origins. A phylogenetic tree was constructed with the consensus genomes

36

for local and non-African strains. Three of the Gambian strains had a European origin

37

(UK and Spain), two strains were of Asian origin (Japan). In The Gambia, Nanopore

38

and Illumina sequencers were successfully used to identify the sources of SARS-CoV-

39

2 infection in COVID-19 cases.

Introduction

44

The emerging and re-emerging of pathogens such as severe acute respiratory

45

syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pose a grave threat to human health.1 The

46

SARS-CoV-2 disease, first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 has become

47

a global pandemic,2 and is causing an unprecedented burden on the health care

48

systems and economies globally.3–6 Worldwide, the number of cases has been

49

increasing exponentially,6 especially in Europe and America, with significant but

50

variable case-fatality rates between continents. By April 28th, 2020, there were more

51

than 3.1 million SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases and more than 200,000 deaths.7

52

Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases in sub-Saharan Africa are currently

53

relatively low, possibly due to much lower international air traffic than in other

54

continents and thus a low number of imported cases.8 By the 28th April 2020, The

55

Gambia, a tourism hotspot, had reported a total of ten SARS-CoV-2 cases, including

56

one death. While the travel history of index cases may suggest the origin of infection,

57

phylogenetic analysis of the strains isolated from these cases and contacts will provide

58

a precise link between local transmission and other global populations.

59

The first SARS-CoV-2 case was reported to be an acquired zoonotic infection,9,10

60

followed by efficient and rapid human-to-human transmission from Wuhan, China, to

61

other Asian countries and then other continents.11–13 The single stranded positive

62

sense RNA genome of the SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the Middle East

63

Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the Severe Acute Respiratory

64

Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV).9–14 These pathogens pose significant risk to

65

global health and modern-day life, hence the need for effective strategies to detect the

66

sources of infections, outbreaks and transmission patterns in different geographical

67

settings.

68

The phylogenetic analyses of global SARS-CoV-2 sequences provide insight into the

69

relatedness of strains from different areas and suggest the transmission of four super-

70

clades,15 geographically clustering into viral isolates from Asia (China), US (two super

71

clades) and Europe. The objective of this analysis was to provide genome data on six

72

cases of SARS-CoV-2 in The Gambia, determine the source of these strains, baseline

73

for subsequent local transmission, and contribute genomic diversity data towards local

74

and global vaccine design. The Oxford Nanopore GridION and Illumina MiSeq

75

platforms were utilized to sequence the viral genomes from four confirmed SARS-

76

CoV-2, one inconclusive and one negative case by rRT-PCR. We also analysed the

77

genomes of samples classified as indeterminate and negative by RT-PCR (COVID-19

78

detection assay) from two different cases respectively.

79

Methods

80

Sample acquisition

81

Nasopharyngeal-Oropharyngeal (NP-OP) swabs (451) from SARS-CoV-2 suspected

82

cases and their contacts were transported to the Medical Research Council Unit The

83

Gambia at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (MRCG at LSHTM). Of

84

the 451 samples screened by rRT-PCR, ten were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 cases

85

and 5 as indeterminate cases (positive for the screening gene and negative for the

86

SARS-CoV-2 confirmatory gene)

87
88

For WGS, four SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases, one indeterminate case and one

89

negative case were processed Table 1. In one of the confirmed cases, different

90

isolates from samples collected up to 10 days apart were sequenced. Of the 6 cases

91

sequenced, 4 were male; 2 females, there was one death, two recoveries and two

92

active cases.

Illumina and Nanopore library preparation

126

The purified cDNA from the depletion and PCR products from the ARTIC protocol were

127

normalised to 100 ng with EB buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl) to a final volume of 25 µl for

128

Illumina library preparation using the NEBNext ultra II DNA library prep kit for Illumina

129

(New England Biolabs, UK; E7645). Following 7 cycles of PCR enrichment, the

130

libraries were purified and quantified using the high sensitivity dsDNA Qubit kit and

131

sized using D1000 ScreenTape on the Agilent TapeStation 4200 (amplicon size range

132

519-572 bp). Each sample was normalised to 10 nM before pooling. The pool was run

133

at a final concentration of 10 pM on an Illumina MiSeq instrument using MiSeq V3

134

reagent kit. The pool was denatured with sodium hydroxide according to Illumina

135

recommendation and spiked with 5% PhiX (PhiX control v3 Illumina Catalogue FC-

136

110-3001) before loading (Fig 1).

137
138

Nanopore sequencing library preparation was performed according to the

139

manufacturer's instructions for the Ligation Sequencing Kit (SQK-LSK109, Oxford

140

Nanopore Technologies). Briefly, the cDNA samples were amplified using the ARTIC

141

protocol and purified with 1X AMPure XP beads. Individual samples were then

142

subjected to end repair and adapter ligation following SQK-LSK109 protocol. 20 ng of

143

each library was loaded on the Oxford Nanopore GridION on individual R9.4.1 flow

Quality control and read mapping for Illumina and Nanopore

154

platform

155

Although a minimum read depth of 30X for the SARS-CoV-2 genome was targeted,

156

more than 100X coverage was generated on both platforms. FASTQ files were

157

subjected to various quality control checks and analysed following standard analysis

158

pipelines (SARS-CoV-2 novel Coronavirus bioinformatics protocol; SAMTOOLS).

159

For Nanopore data, sequencing reads were quality checked using MinIONQC,16 and

160

only reads with a minimum Q score of 7 were included in our subsequent analysis.

161

Quality checked reads were run through what’s in My Pot (WIMP) pipeline on the

162

Oxford Nanopore EPI2ME platform to verify the number of reads characterised as

163

SARS-CoV-2.

164

We used SARS-CoV-2 novel Coronavirus bioinformatics protocol developed by Nick

165

Loman et. al. to analyse the Nanopore data.17 Firstly, we used “ARTIC Guppylex” to

166

remove chimeric reads from each sample with the following parameters (--min-length

167

400 –max-length 700). Filtered reads were then mapped to Wuhan-Hu-1 reference

168

genomes (accession number MN908947.3) and Single nucleotide polymorphism

169

(SNPs) were generated based on the reference and a consensus genome for each

170

sample was generated using SAMTOOLS (v1.9). To further validate our results, we

171

ran all genomes through the coronavirus typing tool (v1.13).

172

Similarly, 250 bp paired end Illumina reads were quality checked using FASTQC

173

(v0.11.5).18 Reads with only a minimum Phred score of 30 were included in our

174

downstream analysis. One sample which was SARS-CoV-2 negative by reverse-

175

transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was characterised as Bat

176

coronavirus using kraken and thus excluded from the analysis. Filtered reads were

177

then mapped to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genomes (accession number

178

MN908947.3) using BWA-mem (0.7.17-r1188). BCFtools Mpileup (v1.8) was used in

179

creating a variant file. Finally, BCFtools consensus was used in generating the FASTA

180

consensus sequence for each sample.

181

Phylogenetic analysis for Illumina and Nanopore platform

182

Prank (v140603) was used to generate a multiple alignment of all the samples

183

including some available reference genomes around the globe (Downloaded from

184

RefSeq). These strains were selected based on the patients’ travel history and the

185

major geographical spread of the pandemic. We finally constructed a maximum

186

likelihood phylogenetic tree using the General time reversible model (GTR) with

187

IQTREE (v1.3.11.1). The Interactive Tree of Life (ITOL) (v5) was used to visualise and

188

annotate the phylogenetic tree.

From the Illumina platform, a high quality read length of 250 bp paired-end reads was

201

generated for each sample after 48 hrs post library preparation. Total number of

sequences ranged from three to six million reads with an average mapping quality of

a read length of 400 - 17000 bp for each sample after 12 hrs of sequencing. It recorded

a range of one to four million reads with average mapping quality of 58 across the

206

reference genome for each sample. To compare the results from both technologies,

207

consensus genomes were generated for each sample and a maximum likelihood

208

phylogenetic tree was constructed. Both platforms showed a similar topology with

210

as illustrated in Figs 2 and 3.

Six genomes (4 samples from Case A, 1 from case D and 1 from case C) from the

222

Gambian samples clustered with the European (Spanish and United Kingdom) SARS-

223

CoV-2 strains. This is not surprising given that these patients had been in Europe

224

before arriving in The Gambia. Although viruses are known to mutate and change

225

rapidly,19,20 the viral genome of case A clustered on the same node at different time

226

points indicating the patient was shedding the same virus with no observed

227

polymorphism according to Nanopore results. Interestingly, the same samples

228

sequenced on the MiSeq suggested polymorphism at day 10, resulting in a longer

229

branch length compared to previous time points (Figure 3). Further analysis of the

230

Illumina data showed seven more SNPs in the day 10 sample compared to the other

231

time points. The SNP winked by the Nanopore phylogenetically, might have an

232

associated higher error rate compared to the Illumina. Strains from cases C and D,

233

both having travelled from France, were more closely related to the Spanish strain

234

included for comparison. Though cases D and A travelled to The Gambia on the same

235

flight, their strains had a different origin, indicating that they could have been infected

236

independently, before the start of their journeys.

237

The viral genome from case B who initiated travel from Bangladesh and then across

238

four other countries, including Senegal, before arriving in The Gambia, clustered with

239

a strain from Japan. This case may have contracted the infection in Asia and his travel

240

history suggests he could have contributed to infections in other countries. The two

241

isolates from case E at different time points clustered with strains from Japan as well.

242

Interestingly, case E samples were indeterminate by rRT-PCR diagnostics, even

243

though the outcome from multiple alignment showed no mismatch between the

244

sequences and the primer set. The indeterminate diagnostic rRT-PCR result could be

245

due to low sensitivity of the assay, an indication of low viral density of SARS-CoV-2 in

246

the sample. Therefore, subsequent follow up for such cases is essential to further

247

evaluate diagnosis and aid towards the understanding of the disease progression and

248

the evolution of this novel virus strain under different case management environments.

249

Although WGS data is still limited in sub-Saharan Africa, this approach has proven to

250

be a highly sensitive, specific and confirmatory tool for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Hence,

251

the use of second and third generation sequencing technologies coupled with

252

bioinformatics is quite imperative in providing data for monitoring transmission

253

dynamics.

254

From the two sequencing platforms, we were able to rapidly generate sequencing data

255

in 20 hours and 3 days after sample reception on the Nanopore and Illumina platforms

256

respectively. While Illumina sequencing may be more accurate in determining within-

257

sample-diversity, Nanopore data can help with the understanding of the linkage

258

between SNPs within individual virions. The Nanopore platform with its flexibility for

259

number of samples per run, and the generation of data in real-time and at a reasonable

260

cost makes it most suitable for outbreaks. Therefore, with our optimised and ready-to-

261

go workflow, we are set to generate data for tracking SARS-CoV-2 in The Gambia and

262

other African countries within 24 hours of sample reception. This would go a long way

263

in providing knowledge on the molecular epidemiology of this disease, give the true

264

burden of the disease in this setting (as seen in the resolution of the indeterminate

265

cases) as well as provide information for African specific vaccine development and

266

inform policy makers on decisions for strategic control measures.

267

Conclusion

268

We have demonstrated that the Nanopore platform with the flexibility of high-end

269

desktop sequencer (GridION) to the portable sequencer (MinION) in combination with

270

the ARTIC protocol and workflow allows for cost-effective (wide range for the number

271

of runs and samples per flow cell), and near real-time generation of pathogen

272

sequence data. Our analysis has shown that the SARS-CoV-2 strains identified in The

273
