Abstract

25

Development of an effective AIDS vaccine remains a challenge. Nucleoside-modified mRNAs

26

formulated in lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-LNP) have proved to be a potent mode of

27

immunization against infectious diseases in preclinical studies, and are being tested for SARS-

28

CoV-2 in humans. A critical question is how mRNA-LNP vaccine immunogenicity compares to

29

that of traditional adjuvanted protein vaccines in primates. Here, we found that mRNA-LNP

30

immunization compared to protein immunization elicited either the same or superior magnitude

31

and breadth of HIV-1 Env-specific polyfunctional antibodies. Immunization with mRNA-LNP

32

encoding Zika premembrane and envelope (prM-E) or HIV-1 Env gp160 induced durable

33

neutralizing antibodies for at least 41 weeks. Doses of mRNA-LNP as low as 5 g were

34

immunogenic in macaques. Thus, mRNA-LNP can be used to rapidly generate single or multi-

35

component vaccines, such as sequential vaccines needed to protect against HIV-1 infection. Such

36

vaccines would be as or more immunogenic than adjuvanted recombinant protein vaccines in

37

primates.

Introduction

42

Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA)-based vaccines have been shown to elicit protective

43

immunity against Zika virus (ZIKV) infection after a single immunization of rhesus macaques 1,

44

and have been designed for many other pathogens including Ebola, influenza, Hepatitis C,

45

Cytomegalovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus 2-7.

46

Recent development of mRNA vaccines has overcome initial roadblocks to their use.

47

mRNA vaccines were initially hindered by innate immune sensing of mRNA 7-9. However,

48

advances in modifying mRNA nucleosides has improved mRNA translation, while eliminating

49

recognition by innate pattern recognition receptors 7,8,10. Specifically, the incorporation of

50

pseudouridine and 1-methyl-pseudouridine prevents recognition of mRNA by Toll-like receptor

51

7 and 8 and other nucleic acid sensing pattern recognition receptors 7. Modification of mRNA in

52

combination with novel HPLC and FPLC purification methods and codon optimization methods

53

have increased the efficiency of mRNA production and the efficacy of mRNA vaccination 8,11,12.

54

For mRNA to be effective at transducing cells in vivo, it must be protected from RNAses. One

55

method for protecting the mRNA from degradation has been its encapsulation in lipid

56

nanoparticles (LNP) 7,8,13. Importantly, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in LNP have been

57

approved by the FDA for treatment of a genetic form of amyloidosis 14. Thus, advances in

58

encapsulation and preventing mRNA immune sensing have made mRNA vaccines a feasible

59

vaccine platform.

60

mRNA vaccines are also attractive as a vaccine platform, because they can accept the

61

genes of various pathogen antigens, and they can be rapidly manufactured at scale. Theses two

62

aspects made mRNA vaccines a prime candidate for responding to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak

63

15,16.

High levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, defined as higher than geometric

64

mean values of convalescent serum from COVID-19 patients, were observed for both

65

nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP and Matrix-M1 adjuvanted subunit protein in human trials16-18.

66

Given the ability of mRNA vaccines to elicit neutralizing antibodies 8,16,17, this platform could

67

improve the elicititation of neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1. However, little data exists on

68

the comparative immunogenicity of mRNA-LNP and proteins in non-human primates. Thus, a

69

key question for HIV-1 vaccine development is whether the immunogenicity of mRNA vaccines

70

encoding HIV-1 immunogens, a poorly immunogenic protein that requires extensive post-

71

translational modifications, is comparable to that of proteins that can be purified after in vitro

72

production.

73

HIV-1 vaccines aiming to elicit protective antibody responses will likely need to elicit

74

polyfunctional non-neutralizing effector antibodies (nnAbs) and/or broadly neutralizing

75

antibodies (bnAbs) 19,20. NnAbs are easy to induce and bind to the surface of virus-infected

76

CD4+ T cells where they can mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).

77

However, their efficacy in protecting against HIV transmission or control of the disease in the

78

setting of high transmission rates was called into question with the HVTN 702 ALVAC-C,

79

gp120-C trial failing to show efficacy 21,22. The only HIV-1 clinical trial to date to demonstrate

80

any efficacy, RV144, induced nnAbs by immunizing with gp120 proteins derived from HIV-1

81

isolates A244 and MN 23. Protection in that trial correlated with binding IgG to the second

82

variable region on Env and ADCC, but the protective antibody response was not durable 24.

83

In contrast to nnAbs, bnAbs are difficult to induce for many reasons including shielding

84

of bnAb Env epitopes by glycans, the metastability of Env conformation, conformational

85

masking of neutralizing epitopes 25-27, host immune controls preventing bnAb development 28,29,

86

and the requirement for multiple highly improbable somatic mutations that are needed for

acquisition of antibody neutralization breadth 30-32. mRNA immunization elicits antigen-specific

88

follicular T helper cells, which are key for affinity maturation of antibodies in germinal centers

33,34,

Regardless of whether it is nnAbs or bnAbs targeted, the poor durability of HIV-1 Env antibody

93

and has been shown to correlate with bnAb development during natural infection 35,36.

Here, we compare the antibody responses in rhesus macaques induced by either HIV-1

94

Env-encoded as nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP or the same vaccine candidate administered as

95

an adjuvanted HIV-1 Env recombinant protein. In each comparison, mRNA-LNP administration

96

induced equal or better immune responses as proteins. Moreover, mRNA-LNP vaccination

97

encoding soluble HIV-1 Env trimers or ZIKV prM-E elicited durable neutralizing antibodies that

98

were stable for approximately one year.

Results

100
101

Both protein and mRNA vaccination elicited high titers of serum HIV-1 binding antibodies
We compared the immunogenicity of HIV-1 Env A244 gp120 lacking the first 11 N-

102

terminal amino acids of gp120 (11 gp120, as in the RV144 trial) 38 administered as either

103

nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP or adjuvanted recombinant protein in rhesus macaques. We

104

immunized two groups of five macaques with recombinant protein formulated in different

105

adjuvants. One group of five macaques received A244 11 gp120 formulated with the aluminum

106

hydroxide adjuvant Rehydragel (Fig. 1A). This group mimicked the A244 11 gp120 protein

107

aluminum hydroxide (Rehydragel) formulation used in the RV144 ALVAC/B/E gp120 trial 23.

108

Adjuvants vary in their immunostimulatory strength; thus, in a second group of five macaques,

109

we assessed the immunogenicity of the A244 11 gp120 Env in combination with a liposomal

110

adjuvant formulation composed of monophosphoryl lipid A (a TLR-4 agonist) and QS21

111

(ALFQ) 39. Additionally, two groups of macaques were immunized with nucleoside-modified

112

mRNA-LNP encoding different forms of A244 11 gp120. One group of macaques received

113

A244 11 gp120, whereas the other group received mRNAs encoding A244 11 gp120 with a

114

D368R mutation that disrupted the CD4 binding site (Fig. 1A). The purpose of the CD4 binding

115

site knockout mutation was to determine whether Env binding to CD4+ T cells in vivo altered

116

immunogenicity of HIV-1 Env gp120. Macaques were immunized with either protein or mRNA-

117

LNP at weeks 0 and 6 and antibody responses were followed for 18 total weeks (Fig. 1A).

118

Binding nnAbs to Env immunogens have been associated with protection in macaques

119

from SHIV infection 40,41. Thus, we first determined serum binding IgG elicited by each of the

120

mRNA/LNP or protein groups. Regardless of site of immunization, gp120-specific IgG titers in

121

the macaque serum were detectable after a single immunization and continued to rise after

122

second immunization (Fig. 1B). mRNA-LNP elicited nearly identical serum IgG antibody titers

123

as compared to macaques immunized with A244 11 gp120 formulated with ALFQ (Fig. 1B).

124

Comparison of mRNA-LNP that encoded wildtype gp120 versus CD4 mutated gp120 showed

125

identical binding IgG elicitation (Fig. 1B). Macaques that received A244 11 gp120 formulated

126

with Rehydragel generated the lowest group mean serum IgG binding titers to A244 11 gp120.

127

For these ELISA assays, the differences between the Rehydragel group and the other groups

128

were greatest after one immunization, but the small numbers of monkeys per group precluded

129

statistical analysis. Nonetheless, ALFQ adjuvant induced higher levels of A244 11 gp120

130

antibody compared to gp120 in Rehydragel (Fig. 1B). The same group ranking was also

131

observed for binding IgG to a HIV-1 Env gp120 B.63521 from a non-vaccine matched HIV-1

132

isolate (Fig. 1B). The binding of serum antibodies to A244 gp120 was not reduced by the

133

introduction of mutations in the CD4 binding, glycan-V3, and glycan-V2 sites (Fig. 1B). Thus,

134

mRNA-LNP gp120 vaccination produced comparable IgG titers in plasma as recombinant gp120

135

protein in the potent adjuvant ALFQ.

136

IgG responses to the second variable (V2) region of HIV-1 Env were a correlate of

137

reduced infection risk in the RV144 trial 24. Similarly, K169 in the V2 region was a site of

138

immune pressure during the RV144 trial 42. To assess whether nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP

139

vaccination elicited comparable V2 region IgG antibodies in plasma, we tested serum IgG

140

binding to various minimal antigens that recapitulated the V2 region of HIV-1 Env. These

141

antigens included V1V2 proteins, a V2 peptide, and V2 scaffolded on gp70. Binding to each

142

antigen showed the same pattern as gp120 binding. Recombinant protein adjuvanted with AFLQ

143

and mRNA-LNP immunization elicited nearly identical plasma IgG responses (Fig. 2).

144

Recombinant gp120 adjuvanted with Rehydragel elicited the weakest responses for all the

145

antigens tested, with group difference being largest after a single immunization (Fig. 2). V1V2-

146

specific binding IgG titers were comparable whether the V1V2 antigen matched the vaccine

147

strain or if it was from an unmatched virus 1086C (Fig. 2A). The first variable region (V1) was

148

not necessary for V2 binding, as plasma IgG bound to a short V2 only peptide, K178 (Fig. 2B).

149

The antigen for which binding IgG correlated with reduced infection risk in the RV144 trial was

150

B.CaseA V1V2 scaffolded on gp70 24,43. Each group of macaques generated binding IgG

151

antibodies to gp70 B.CaseA V1V2 protein (Fig. 2C). The antibodies were specific for HIV-1

152

V1V2, as no antibodies were detected against the control gp70 scaffold presenting murine

153

leukemia virus V1V2 (Fig. 2C). However, mutation of K169 had little effect on B.CaseA V1V2

154

binding IgG titers. Similarly, mutation of the K169 in the V2 region of A244 gp120 had little

7

155

effect on binding IgG titers (Fig. 1B). Thus, V1V2 antibodies were not solely dependent on the

156

K169 at the site of immune pressure observed in the RV144 trial.

157

To determine the breadth of reactivity and epitope specificity of the first and second

158

variable (V1V2) region antibodies induced by each vaccine, we performed linear V1V2 peptide

159

arrays. Vaccination induced only low levels of V1-binding antibodies, but high titers of V2

160

antibodies across the different vaccines (Fig. 3A-D and Supplementary Fig. 1). V2 antibody

161

binding magnitudes were similar for mRNA-LNP and protein formulated with ALFQ (Fig. 3).

162

Each vaccine elicited antibodies capable of binding V2 peptides from clade AE and C (Fig. 3

163

and Supplementary Fig. 1). Therefore, mRNA-LNP and adjuvanted protein vaccination elicited

164

V2 antibody responses that were similar in magnitude, breadth, and epitope specificity.

165

Next, we compared plasma antibody specificities induced by protein or mRNA-LNP

166

immunization at HIV-1 Env gp120 sites outside of the V1V2 site. mRNA-LNP induced similar

167

A244 gp120 linear epitope antibodies compared to protein formulated in adjuvant with two

168

exceptions. First, recombinant protein, but not mRNA-LNP, elicited plasma IgG to the C-

169

terminal portion of the second constant (C2) region (Fig. 3E-H and Supplementary Fig. 2).

170

Second, mRNA-LNP immunization elicited plasma IgG against the third constant region but

171

recombinant protein immunization did not (Fig. 3E-H and Supplementary Fig. 2).

172

To further compare polyclonal plasma IgG specificities, we assessed the ability of post-

173

vaccination plasma to block the binding of gp120 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to HIV-1 Env.

174

Plasma from either adjuvanted protein- or mRNA-LNP-immunized macaques was added to HIV-

175

1 Env protein, followed by the addition of biotinylated mAbs to determine plasma antibody

176

blocking of monoclonal antibody binding to Env. We examined blocking of non-neutralizing

177

effector antibodies CH58, which targets the V2 site of immune pressure identified in RV144 44,

8

178

and A32 which defines an immunodominant ADCC gp120 site 45 that synergizes with V2

179

antibodies to mediate ADCC 46 (Fig. 4A). Next, we determined whether plasma could block the

180

HIV-1 entry receptor CD4 from binding to Env (Fig. 4B), or block V2-glycan bnAbs PG9 and

181

CH01 and N332 glycan-dependent bnAbs 2G12 and PGT125 Env binding (Fig. 4C,D). Either

182

immunization with adjuvanted recombinant gp120 protein or mRNA-LNP elicited plasma

183

antibodies that blocked the binding of CH58, A32, CD4, CH01, 2G12, and PGT125 (Fig. 4).

184

Comparison of mRNA-LNP-induced antibodies versus gp120 protein-induced plasma antibodies

185

showed that mRNA-LNP immunization elicited the same magnitude of blocking after 2

186

immunizations as protein adjuvanted with ALFQ (Fig. 4). Blocking activity was lowest for

187

animals immunized with protein adjuvanted with Rehydragel (Fig. 4). The blocking of CH01

188

binding to A244 most likely represented CH58-like antibody binding and not V2-glycan bnAb

189

binding, since CH01 binding can be blocked by CH58-like linear V2 antibodies (Fig. 4).

190
191

Comparable neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibody functions induced by adjuvanted

193

Several IgG Fc receptor (R)-mediated immune responses have been associated with

194

decreased transmission risk either in the RV144 trial or in Env immunizations studies in

195

macaques followed by low dose mucosal SHIV challenges 41,47. These immune responses include

196

binding to HIV-1 infected CD4+ T cells, ADCC and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis

197

(ADCP).To assess the potential for week 8 plasma IgG to mediate effector functions against

198

infected cells, we first examined plasma IgG binding to HIV-1.CM235-infected T cells. Plasma

199

IgG from all four groups of macaques was able to bind to HIV-infected cells (Fig. 5A,B). When

200

binding levels of IgG was quantified as mean fluorescence intensity of bound IgG or the

201

percentage of cells positive for HIV-1 protein p24 and plasma IgG, mRNA-LNP vaccination and

202

recombinant protein adjuvanted with ALFQ were not different (Fig. 5A,B). In agreement with

203

the overall lower IgG titers, Rehydragel-adjuvanted protein gave the weakest cell binding

204

responses (Fig. 5A,B).

205

ADCC activity was measured in a flow cytometry-based granzyme B assay. There was a

206

clear adjuvant effect between the two protein immunized group. ADCC titers were

207

approximately one order of magnitude higher when ALFQ was used as the adjuvant as compared

208

to Rehydragel. Similarly, mRNA-LNP immunization (mean±standard deviation =

209

22,916±22,102) induced activity lower than ALFQ-formulated recombinant protein, but 3-fold

210

higher than protein adjuvanted with Rehydragel (mean±standard deviation = 7,324±7,024) (Fig.

211

5C). Elimination of CD4 binding to A244 11 gp120 had no effect on ADCC activity (Fig. 5C).

212

Lastly, we compared ADCP activity of week 8 plasma antibodies from macaques administered

213

adjuvanted recombinant protein or mRNA-LNP. Median plasma ADCP activity against A244

214

gp120-coated beads was similar across all groups with A244 11 gp120 in Rehydragel eliciting a

215

wider range of responses (Fig. 5D). In agreement with previous studies, nucleoside-modified

216

mRNA-LNP vaccination elicited antibody effector functions that have been shown previously to

217

correlate with reduced infection risk 24,48.

218

While the goal of A244 11 gp120 immunization was to induce non-neutralizing effector

219

functions like those seen in the RV144 trial, we compared elicitation of neutralizing antibodies

220

by each of the vaccines. We selected for testing the tier 1 HIV-1 strain CRF_01AE 92TH023,

221

against which A244 has consistently induced neutralizing antibodies

222

was no significant difference among the different vaccination regimens for induction of HIV-1

223

92TH023 neutralizing antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 3). These studies showed that for

24,44.

We found that there

224

immunization with gp120 monomers aiming to elicit potentially protective non-neutralizing V2

225

antibodies, nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP vaccination was superior to recombinant protein

226

formulated with aluminum hydroxide and comparable to recombinant protein formulated with a

227

more complex TLR-4/QS21/liposomal adjuvant.

229

Immunizations of macaques with sequential CH505 Env gp160 mRNA-LNP, SOSIP gp140

230

mRNA-LNP, or adjuvanted recombinant SOSIP gp140 proteins

231

We previously isolated CD4 binding site bnAbs from the African individual CH505 49,50.

232

From CH505, we cloned a series of different CH505 Envs for testing as immunogens to induce

233

similar types of bnAbs with vaccination 49,50. To this end, we studied a mRNA-LNP sequential

234

immunization strategy where each individual envelope in the series is delivered one-at-a-time in

235

a specific order. The HIV-1 envelope immunogens were designed as transmembrane HIV-1

236

gp160s (50 g/immunization) or soluble, stabilized gp140 SOSIP trimers (50 g/immunization;

237

Fig. 6A). The SOSIP gp140s were stabilized by a chimeric gp41 and the addition of E64K and

238

A316W mutations 51. The immunogenicity of these two sets of mRNA-LNP was compared to

239

that of 100 g of the same set of CH505 Envs as soluble gp140 SOSIP proteins formulated in the

240

TLR-4 adjuvant, GLA-SE (Fig. 6A). Four rhesus macaques were immunized every four weeks

241

with either set of immunogens (Fig. 6A), and binding antibody and neutralizing antibodies were

242

measured.

243

All three vaccines were immunogenic in macaques. With regard to induction of binding

244

titers of gp120 antibodies, mRNA-LNP encoding sequential CH505 gp160s induced higher

245

gp120 titers than did either of the mRNA-LNP encoding soluble gp140 SOSIP trimers or soluble

246

gp140 SOSIP trimers proteins (Fig. 6B). These binding titers rose dramatically after two

247

immunizations with gp160 mRNA-LNP, but rose gradually over the course of five

248

immunizations in macaques immunized with SOSIP gp140s (Fig. 6B). Plasma IgG binding titers

249

to gp120 were equivalent between the mRNA-LNP and the adjuvanted soluble gp140 SOSIP

trimer protein-immunized animals (Fig. 6B). Soluble gp120 exposes non-neutralizing epitopes,

thus we examined whether the high titers of gp120 antibodies in macaques immunized with

252

gp160 mRNA-LNP were due to antibodies targeting these sites. Indeed, the gp160 mRNA-LNP

253

induced very high titers of antibodies to linear CH505 TF V2 peptides, whereas titers in the

254

gp140 SOSIP trimer groups showed no or a slight increase from baseline (Fig. 6C). Linear V3

255

epitopes were also highly immunogenic in gp160 mRNA-LNP-immunized macaques, and to a

256

lesser extent was immunogenic in soluble gp140 SOSIP trimer protein immunized macaques

257

(Fig. 6D). Interestingly, V3 antibodies were not elicited by gp140 SOSIP trimer mRNA-LNP,

258

suggesting a difference in V3 exposure when the trimer was expressed in vivo or potential effects

259

of the adjuvant. To examine the induction of gp120 antibodies that may target conserved

260

neutralizing epitopes, we assessed the amount of gp120 antibody binding that was dependent on

261

the CD4 binding site. We mutated the CD4 binding site with a deletion of the isoleucine at

262

position 371 and determined the decrease in plasma IgG binding to CH505 TF gp120. Both

263

groups of macaques that received SOSIP trimers as either protein gp140s or mRNA-LNP were

264

superior to the mRNA-LNP encoding the gp160s (Fig. 6E). Immunization with gp140 SOSIP

265

trimers elicited differential binding between the mutant and wildtype gp120 that rapidly receded

266

after each immunization, but was maintained for 16 weeks once immunizations were stopped

267

(Fig. 6E). Similar to linear V2 and V3 peptide antibodies, gp160 mRNA-LNP induced high

268

levels of gp41 antibodies whereas gp140 SOSIP trimers delivered as mRNA-LNP or adjuvanted

269

recombinant protein had levels close to baseline (Fig. 6F). Thus, gp160 mRNA-LNP

270

immunization elicited higher titers of undesired antibodies targeting non-neutralizing gp120 and

271

gp41 epitopes and lower titers of desired CD4 binding site antibodies than SOSIP trimer-

272

encoding mRNA-LNP or adjuvanted recombinant protein. However, none of the regimens

273

induced significant tier 2 or heterologous neutralizing antibodies due to the need for high affinity

274

germline B cell targeting and designs of sequential Env regimens that select for bnAb

275

improbable mutations (Supplementary Tables 1-3) 20,31,32,52,53.

276

The high levels of undesired antibodies elicited by gp160 mRNA-LNP immunization

277

could be due to poorly-folded HIV-1 envelope expressed on the surface of cells. We

278

hypothesized that stabilization of HIV-1 envelope with amino acid substitutions that preserve

279

Env trimers in their native conformation could reduce HIV-1 envelope binding to non-

280

neutralizing antibodies. We introduced stabilizing amino acid changes H66A and A582T into

281

envelope 54. Also, we generated envelopes with G458Y and cysteines at positions 113 and 429 or

282

113 and 43155. The cysteines have been shown to form disulfide bonds that keep the HIV-1

283

envelope in the closed conformation55 and G458Y stabilizes the envelope fifth variable loop53.

284

Among these variants of the M5 gp160 envelope, adding H66A and A582T reduced binding by

285

non-neutralizing antibodies against V3 and gp41, while leaving trimer-specific (PGT145) or

286

timer-preferring (PG9 and CH01) antibody binding unchanged (Fig. 6G). Thus, mRNA

287

immunization with stabilized HIV-1 envelope gp160 is one potential approach to improve the

288

elicitation of neutralizing antibodies, while not engaging the B cell receptor of B cells that

289

produce antibodies that cannot bind native, fusion-competent HIV-1 envelope.

290

Nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP immunization induces durable antibody responses

291

against Zika prM-E and HIV-1 Env.

292

Inducing durable Env antibody responses is a key goal of HIV vaccine development. Yet

293

in the RV144 trial, protective antibodies fell dramatically over the first 42 weeks after

294

vaccination 24. Thus, if immunization with mRNA-LNP induced durable antibody responses it

295

would benefit their use as a vaccine platform for many different infectious diseases. We assessed

296

the durability of antibody responses using neutralization assays of the tier 1 CH505 w4.3 virus,

297

since antibodies capable of neutralization of the tier 2 CH505 transmitted founder (TF) virus

298

were not elicited (Supplementary Tables 1-3). CH505 w4.3 is an early virus isolate that is

299

identical to the tier 2 CH505 TF virus with the exception of a W680G mutation that makes it

300

highly sensitive to HIV antibody neutralization 49,56,57. Longitudinal comparative analyses of

301

neutralization of the CH505 w4.3 virus showed that the gp160-encoding mRNA-LNP elicited

302

higher titers of neutralizing antibodies than the gp140 SOSIP trimer-encoding mRNA-LNP or

303

the gp140 SOSIP trimer proteins in GLA/SE 58 (Fig. 7A). Notably, neutralization of the CH505

304

w4.3 virus was still detectable in all three groups 12 weeks after the last immunization (Fig. 7A).

305

There were also sporadic low levels of neutralization of CH505 or 426C viruses that were

306

modified to be highly sensitive to CD4 binding site antibodies (Supplementary Tables 1-3).

307

While these results indicated that durable neutralizing antibodies were elicited by each

308

vaccine regimen, the downward trend of the neutralization titers in these macaques and the

309

A244-immunized macaques raised the question of how long would neutralizing antibodies

310

persist at detectable levels. A subset of the macaques used in this HIV-1 study were previously

311

administered 50 g of mRNA-LNP encoding ZIKV pre-membrane and envelope (prM-E). These

312

macaques generated protective anti-Zika neutralizing antibody responses 1. Using these

313

macaques that were administered both HIV and Zika mRNA-LNP vaccines, we determined

314

serum neutralizing antibodies titers over 52 weeks (Fig. 7B). We found that neutralizing

14

315

antibodies against ZIKV were maintained until the last timepoint of follow-up 52 weeks after

316

immunization. Neutralizing antibodies to HIV-1 persisted for the duration of the 41 weeks of

317

follow-up. During these 41 weeks, HIV-1 titers initially fell approximately 10-fold after the last

318

immunization but plateaued at ~1:100 titer (Fig. 7B). In contrast, Zika neutralizing antibody

319

levels were maintained at the same level for the 52 weeks after being detected at week 2 (Fig.

320

7B). Similar patterns were observed for plasma binding IgG titers to CH505 gp120 and Zika

321

prM-E (Fig. 7C). Taken together, nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP immunizations induced

322

durable serum neutralizing antibodies for both HIV-1 and Zika viruses.

323

Neutralizing antibody titers are dependent on mRNA-LNP dose. In our previous ZIKV

324

vaccine studies in nonhuman primates, we administered 50, 200 or 600 g of mRNA-LNP1.

325

Given the potent elicitation of neutralizing antibodies by mRNA administered at each of these

326

doses, we sought to determine whether the mRNA dose could be further decreased. We

327

immunized four macaques intramuscularly with either 50, 20, or 5 g of mRNA-LNP encoding

328

Zika prM-E (Fig. 8A) and compared titers of binding IgG and neutralizing antibodies. Fifity and

329

twenty microgram doses of mRNA-LNP elicited similar titers of binding IgG and neutralizing

330

antibodies (Fig. 8B and C). Titers of ZIKV binding IgG and neutralizing antibodies were

331

substantially decreased when the mRNA-LNP dose was lowered to 5 g, but were detectable

332

with administration of this single administration of a small amount of mRNA-LNP in macaques.

333

The route of immunization was not critical as administering 50 g of mRNA-LNP either

334

intramuscularly or intradermally elicited comparable Zika envelope binding IgG and Zika

335

neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 8B and C). Thus, the mRNA-LNP dose could be lowered from 50

336

to 20 g in macaques without detrimental effects to antibody responses. Thus, more

immunizations can be performed with each preparation of mRNA-LNP by reducing the dose by

60 percent.

339

Discussion

340

Here, we demonstrate in 28 rhesus macaques that immunization with nucleoside-modified

341

mRNA-LNP (n=16) was equal to or superior to the immunogenicity of adjuvanted Env protein.

342

There are multiple factors for why nucleoside-modified mRNA immunization has potent

343

immunogenicity for viral proteins. First, mRNA is delivered by LNP to dendritic cells and likely

344

other immune cells that are able to activate naïve T cells to respond to the vaccine immunogen 59-

345

61.

346

germinal center T and B cell responses 2. Within the germinal center, follicular T helper cells

347

provide help to B cells undergoing affinity maturation 34. The affinity maturation process is

348

critical for the development of high affinity antibodies after vaccination, and in particular for

349

HIV-1 is required for bnAb development 62. Animal models vaccinated with nucleoside-modified

350

mRNA-LNP encoding HIV-1 Env or influenza virus hemagglutinin develop high levels of

351

pathogen-specific T follicular helper cells 33. Given that HIV-1 neutralizing antibody breadth is

352

correlated with the frequency of circulating T follicular helper cells 35,63, nucleoside-modified

353

mRNA-LNP immunization warrants further study as an HIV-1 vaccine platform. Nucleoside-

354

modified mRNAs have many potential advantages over proteins including speed of production

355

and cost-savings. Moreover, mRNA-LNP increases the feasibility of making under current good

356

manufacturing practices the multicomponent vaccines that are needed to induce both protective

357

HIV-1 bnAbs and nnAbs.

358
359

Second, nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP immunization generates robust antigen-specific

In RV144, aluminum hydroxide (Rehydragel) was used and poor durability of protective
immune responses was observed 24,64. ALFQ is a potent adjuvant that contains anionic

16

360

liposomes, QS21, and TLR-4 agonist, MPL 39, both potent adjuvants. Thus, comparison of

361

mRNA-LNP with Rehydragel gives a direct indication of how it might fare versus the RV144

362

regimen, and comparison with ALFQ provides an indication of how it might fare in comparison

363

with a stronger adjuvant. The adjuvant GLA (synthetic MPL) in SE (stable emulsion) 58 has

364

been used in HVTN 115 with multiple gp120s and was immunogenic, although in a head-to-head

365

comparison of Rehydragel and GLA-SE in primates, they were similar in promoting

366

immunogenicity except for V2 responses where Rehydragel was superior. While ALFQ and

367

GLA stable emulsion contains lipids, they differ from the lipid nanoparticles. The lipid

368

nanoparticles include ionizable cationic lipids that give the lipid nanoparticle a neutral surface

369

charge, whereas most commercial liposomes lack ionizable cationic lipids. The neutral charge

370

helps reduce non-specific protein binding in vivo. Unlike GLA or ALFQ, the LNP does not

371

activate TLR-4, but instead activates follicular helper T cells33. In general, with the doses and

372

adjuvants used in this study of proteins versus mRNA-LNP, nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP

373

immunization was superior or equal to protein in Rehydragel or GLA-SE and equal to protein in

374

ALFQ. Future studies using different vaccination intervals, adjuvants, and protein doses could

375

corroborate this conclusion.

376

There are currently two ongoing efficacy trials that test the protective capacity of non-

377

neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies with viral vector prime, Env protein boosts to determine if the 42

378

month efficacy of ALVAC/gp120 can be replicated. In addition, the just-completed HVTN 702

379

trial (NCT02968849) that uses an ALVAC with a clade C Env insert as prime and ALVAC-C +

380

a bivalent C gp120 Env boost failed to confer any protection from HIV-1 infection in South

381

Africa in an area of high HIV-1 infection rates. The ongoing HVTN 705 trial (NCT03060629)

382

tests the efficacy of an adenovirus (Ad) 26 vector containing mosaic HIV-1 genes as a prime and

17

383

the same Ad26 + a clade C gp140 Env as a boost, and the HVTN 706 trial (NCT03964415) tests

384

the efficacy of Ad26 mosaic HIV as a prime and Ad26 + a bivalent clade C gp140 Env + a

385

mosaic gp140 Env as boost 65. The correlate of decreased transmission risk in macaque studies

386

of the A26, Ad26 + gp140 boost SHIV challenge studies did not include neutralization breadth

387

of antibodies, but instead included clade C Env ELISA binding antibodies and interferon gamma

388

Env ELISPOT values 65. Thus, these latter two vaccines will test whether non-neutralizing

389

antibody effector functions can mediate significant protection in humans.

390

The ease and cost-effectiveness of mRNA-LNP production compared to the production

391

of multiple recombinant proteins by good manufacturing practice (GMP) techniques makes

392

mRNA-LNP particularly attractive. Furthermore, the scalability of mRNA-LNP for thousands to

393

millions of doses again make the cost and ease of production of mRNA-LNP attractive. These

394

manufacturing considerations are key for improving on RV144, and show great promise for

395

COVID-19 vaccines currently under development 17. However, the cold temperature required for

396

distribution and storage of mRNA vaccines remains a challenge for this vaccine platform 66.

397

While mRNA vaccination is promising, there are still improvements that can be made for

398

HIV mRNA-LNP vaccination. Specifically, for bnAb induction by mRNAs, the near-native Env

399

trimers will need to be stabilized such that they will be able to be produced by the transfected

400

cell in a well-folded state. This challenge is not unique to mRNA as DNA vaccination has also

401

faced similar roadblocks67. This aspect of genetic vaccination differs from recombinant proteins

402

that can be purified prior to immunization and recognition by the immune system. However,

403

there is a plethora of available mutations for stabilizing HIV-1 envelope, and each envelope has

404

different intrinsic stability that can be further augmented. We investigated only two potential sets

405

and found H66A and A587T reduced non-neutralizing antibody binding to envelope in vitro. The

18

406

reduction in non-neutralizing antibody binding suggests a higher percentage of native-like

407

envelope expressed by the mRNA. Future vaccine studies will need to determine whether

408

reduced non-neutralizing antibody binding in vitro translates to improved neutralizing antibody

409

elicitation in vivo. Despite the best envelope stabilization designs, it is possible that not all of the

410

envelope will be well-folded, native-like trimers. In vivo studies by us and others are aiming to

411

determine what the percentage of well-folded envelope needs to be in order to elicit optimal

412

neutralizing antibody responses. Both of these important questions are areas of intense

413

investigation and are critical for mRNA becoming a widely accepted HIV-1 vaccine platform.

414

In summary, comparison of nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP with recombinant Env

415

proteins in three adjuvants demonstrated the utility of mRNA-LNP as a mode of inducing nnAbs

416

that are predicted to be protective against retrovirus challenge. We suggest that moving to

417

nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP for the next generation of clinical trials for multivalent Env

418

immunization will be advantageous and speed the development of a globally available protective

419

HIV-1 vaccine.

Methods

443

Animals and Immunizations. Rhesus macaques were housed and treated in AAALAC-

444

accredited institutions. The study protocol and all veterinarian procedures were approved by the

445

Duke University IACUC and were performed based on standard operating procedures. Macaques

446

were anesthetized with ketamine for immunizations and blood collection. For protein

447

immunizations, rhesus macaques were immunized with 300 g of A244 gp120 monomers in the

448

quadriceps. In previous macaque studies 300 g and 100 g of A244 gp120 monomers gave

449

equivalent antibody responses. Thus, 100 g of HIV-1 CH505 stabilized SOSIP gp140

450

recombinant protein were administered in the quadriceps of rhesus macaques instead of 300 g.

451

Total immunization volume was 1 mL of protein and adjuvant diluted in phosphate-buffered

452

saline (PBS). For RNA immunizations, rhesus macaques were shaved on their backs and injected

453

intradermally with nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP diluted in PBS. For ZIKV immunization,

454

three macaques received 600 g and two macaques received 200 g of mRNA expressing Zika

455

preM-E 1. In our previously published mRNA-LNP titration, there was no difference in antibody

456

titers with 600, 200, and 50 g of mRNA-LNP expressing Zika preM-E1; thus, for HIV-1

457

immunizations we administered 50 g of mRNA-LNP expressing HIV-1 Env. Blood was

458

collected by femoral venipuncture under ketamine anesthesia. Serum and EDTA-plasma were

459

isolated from whole blood and stored at −80°C 1.

Production of Recombinant Env protein immunogens. Recombinant HIV-1 Env gp120 was

461

expressed in Freestyle 293 cells (ThermoFisher) by transient transfection. To transfect Freestyle

462

293 cells, 1 milligram of plasmid DNA encoding HIV-1 Env per 1 liter of cells was diluted in

463

DMEM and mixed with polyethyleneimine (PEI, Polysciences, Inc.). The DNA was allowed to

464

complex with PEI for 25 min and then cells were added. The Freestyle 293 cells were incubated

465

with the PEI:DNA mixtures for 4 h. Freestyle 293 (ThermoFisher) cells were subsequently

466

centrifuged and resuspended in Freestyle293 media (ThermoFisher) at a final density of 1.25

467

million cells/mL. Four days after transfection, the cell culture media was cleared of cells by

468

centrifugation and filtered with 0.8 m filter. A Vivaflow 50 with a 10 kD MWCO

469

(ThermoFisher) was used to concentrate the cell-free culture media. The concentrated cell

470

culture supernatant was incubated with Galanthus Nivalis lectin beads (Vistar Laboratories)

471

rotating overnight at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation the next day and

472

resuspended in MES wash buffer (20mM MES, 10mM CaCl2, 130mM NaCl pH7.0). The lectin

473

beads were washed twice with MES wash buffer, and the protein was eluted with MES wash

477

HIV-1 Env soluble trimers were designed as gp41-chimeric SOSIP gp140s 68-70. The

478

gp41-chimeric SOSIP gp140s were further stabilized by the addition of E64K and A316W

479

mutations 68. CH505 SOSIP gp140 Envs were expressed as previously described 71. Freestyle293

480

cells (Invitrogen) were diluted to 1.25x106 cells/mL with fresh Freestyle293 media up to 1L total

481

volume. The cells were co-transfected with 650 μg of SOSIP expressing plasmid DNA and 150

482

μg of furin expressing plasmid DNA complexed with 293Fectin (Invitrogen). The cell culture

483

supernatant clarified on day 6 and subjected to positive PGT145 antibody affinity

484

chromatography. Eluted protein was concentrated down to 2 mL for size exclusion

485

chromatography with a Superose6 16/600 column (GE Healthcare) in 10 mM Tris pH8, 500 mM

507

One-methylpseudouridine (m1Ψ)-5’-triphosphate (TriLink) instead of UTP was used to generate

508

modified nucleoside-containing mRNA. RNAs were capped using the m7G capping kit with 2’-

509

O-methyltransferase (ScriptCap, CellScript) to obtain a type 1 cap. mRNA was purified by Fast

510

Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) (Akta Purifier, GE Healthcare), as described 74. All

511

mRNAs were analyzed by denaturing or native agarose gel electrophoresis and were stored

521

In vitro mRNA transfection and flow cytometry. In vitro mRNA transfection and antibody

522

binding were performed as earlier described77. Freestyle 293F cells were maintained at 37°C

523

with 8% CO2 and shaking at 130 rpm. Cells were diluted to 1x106 cells/ml prior to transfection.

524

Bare mRNA encoding CH505 M5 gp160 Envs were transfected at 0.5 μg/million cells using

525

TransIT-mRNA Transfection Kit (Mirus). Transfected cells were harvested 48 hr post

526

transfection. Cells were first incubated with HIV antibodies at 10 μg/ml for 30 min at 4°C in

527

dark. Antibody binding was then detected by Goat F(ab')2 Anti-Human IgG - (Fab')2 (PE) (used

528

at 2.5 μg/ml) by incubating cells with the secondary antibody for 30 min at 4°C in dark. Finally,

529

data were collected on a LSRII with a high-throughput system.

530

HIV-1 Env direct ELISAs. Direct ELISAs were performed as stated previously 78,79.

531

Specifically, NuncSorp 384-well plates were coated with 30 ng (2 μg/mL) of antigen in 0.1 M

532

sodium bicarbonate overnight at 4°C. Plates were washed with SuperWash and blocked with

533

SuperBlock. Plates were washed. Plasma was serially diluted in SuperBlock and added to the

534

ELISA plate. The plate was washed twice and a 1:8000 dilution of anti-rhesus IgG conjugated to

535

horseradish peroxidase (HRP; Rockland Immunochemicals) was incubated in the plate for 1 h.

536

The plate was washed and tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; KPL) was incubated in the plate for 15

537

min to detect secondary antibody binding. The reaction was stopped with 1% HCl and

538

absorbance at 450 nm was read with a SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices). SoftMax

539

Pro v5.3 was used to calculate log area-under-the-curve (AUC; Molecular Devices).

540

Plasma competition ELISAs. Plasma competition assays were performed as described

541

previously 78,79. In brief, NuncSorp plates were coated with HIV-1 Env, washed and blocked as

542

stated above for direct ELISAs. After blocking was complete, nonhuman primate plasma was

543

diluted in SuperBlock at a 1:50 dilution and incubated in triplicate wells for 90 min. Non-

544

biotinylated monoclonal antibodies were incubated with the Env in triplicate as positive controls

545

for blocking. To determine relative binding no plasma or no antibody was added to a group of

546

wells scattered throughout the plate. After 90 min the non-biotinylated antibody or plasma was

547

washed away and biotinylated monoclonal antibodies was incubated in the wells for 1 h at

548

subsaturating concentrations. Specifically, biotinylated monoclonal antibody concentrations used

549

for binding to A244 11 gp120 were: 0.04 g/mL of CH58, 0.1 g/mL of A32, 1.9 g/mL of

550

2G12, 0.2 g/mL of PGT125, 1.2 g/mL of CH01, 1g/mL of PG9. Biotinylated CH01 and

551

PG9 concentrations used for binding to 9021 gp140 and B.6240 11 gp120 were 1.5 and 0.125

552

g/mL respectively. For CD4 blocking assays, soluble CD4 was added followed by biotinylated

553

anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody. Each well was washed and binding of biotinylated monoclonal

554

antibodies was determined with a 1:30000 dilution of HRP-conjugated streptavidin

555

(ThermoFisher). HRP was detected with TMB and stopped with 1% HCl. The absorbance at

556

450 nm of each well was read with a Spectramax plate reader (Molecular Devices). Binding of

557

the biotinylated monoclonal antibody to HIV-1 Env in the absence of plasma was compared to in

558

the presence of plasma to calculate percent inhibition of binding. Based on historical negative

559

controls, assays were considered valid if the positive control antibodies blocked greater than 20%

560

of the biotinylated antibody binding.

561

HIV-1 Env Peptide Array. Peptide arrays were performed as previously described 80. The HIV-

562

1 peptide libraries contain overlapping HIV-1 peptides covering full-length gp120 of 5 consensus

563

viruses from group M and clades A, B, C, and D 80. Array slides were provided by JPT Peptide

564

Technologies GmbH (Germany) by printing a library of peptides onto epoxy glass slides

565

(PolyAn GmbH, Germany). The library contains overlapping peptides (15-mers overlapping by

566

12) covering 5 full-length gp160 consensus sequences (clade A, B, C, D, and group M). V3

567

peptide binding breadth was analyzed for a library of V3 peptides (15-mers overlapping by 12)

568

for 7 consensus sequences (clade A, B, C, D, CRF1, and CRF2, and group M) and 6 vaccine

569

strains (MN, A244, TH023, TV-1, ZM651, 1086C). Three identical subarrays were blocked for 1

570

h, followed by a 2-h incubation with monoclonal antibody, and a subsequent 45-min incubation

571

with anti-monkey IgG conjugated with AF647 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, PA). Slides were

572

washed before the addition of monoclonal antibody or anti-monkey IgG. Unbound anti-monkey

573

IgG conjugated with AF647 was washed away, and array slides were scanned at a wavelength of

574

635 nm using an InnoScan 710 scanner (InnopSys, Denmark) and images were analyzed using

575

Magpix V8.1.1.

576

Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC). ADCC activity was measured by ADCC

577

GranToxiLux (GTL) 81 and tested against subtype AE HIV-1 recombinant A244 ∆11 gp120-

578

coated cells. NHP plasma were incubated with human PBMC as source of effector cells 82 and

579

gp120-coated target CEM.NKR.CCR5 cells 83 and ADCC was quantified as net percent granzyme

580

B activity, which is the percent of target cells positive for GranToxiLux (GTL) detected by flow

581

cytometry. For each subject at each timepoint, percent granzyme B activity was measured at six

582

dilution levels: 50, 250, 1250, 6250, 31,250 and 156,250 for each antigen. Peak activity less than

583

0% was set to 0%. A positive response was defined as peak activity greater than or equal to 8%.

584

The RSV-specific monoclonal antibody Palivizumab and a cocktail of HIV-1 monoclonal Abs

585

(A32, 2G12, CH44, and 7B2) were used as negative and positive control, respectively. The

586

potency of ADCC responses was evaluated by calculating the Area Under the Curve using the

587

non-parametric trapezoidal method.

588

Infected Cells Ab Binding Assay (ICABA). The measurement of plasma Ab binding to HIV-1

589

Env expressed on the surface of infected cells was conducted using flow-cytometry-based

590

indirect surface staining according to methods similar to those previously described 41,84. Briefly,

591

mock infected and the subtype AE HIV-1 CM235-infected (HIV-CM235-2.LucR.T2A/293T/17,

592

Accession Number AF259954.1) CEM.NKRCCR5 cells 83 were incubated with 1:100 dilutions of

593

plasma samples collected from the animals before immunizations and 2 weeks after the 2nd

594

immunization (week 8) for 2h at 37°C, then stained with a vital dye (Live/Dead Aqua) to exclude

595

dead cells from analysis. The cells were subsequently washed, and permeabilized using BD

596

Cytofix/Cytoperm solution. After an additional wash, cells were stained with FITC-conjugated

597

goat-anti-Rhesus polyclonal antisera (Southern Biotech) to detect binding of the plasma Ab

598

(pAb), and RD1-conjugated anti-HIV-1 p24 (KC57, Beckman Coulter) to identify infected cells.

599

Backgroud signal was defined as signal obtained when staining cells with the secondary antibody

600

alone, and signal observed when staining the mock-infected cells. Cells scored as positive for

601

NHP plasma binding were defined as viable, p24 positive, and FITC positive. Final results are

602

reported as the percent of FITC positive cells (p24+pAb+) and FITC MFI among the viable p24

603

positive events after subtracting the background. Baseline correction for the FITC MFI was

604

performed by subtracting pre-immunization MFI wherever applicable.

605

Antibody-dependent phagocytosis. Phagocytosis was measured as stated previously 85,86.

606

Briefly, recombinant A244 11 gp120 was incubated with 1 μM fluorescent beads overnight at

607

4°C while rotating. The beads were subsequently washed twice with 0.1% BSA/PBS to remove

608

unbound gp120. gp120-coated beads were incubated with prevaccination and postvaccination

609

plasma for 2 h at 37°C. As a positive control HIVIG was incubated with the beads. As a negative

610

control monoclonal antibody CH65 was incubated with the beads, since this antibody reacts with

27

611

influenza hemagglutinin and not HIV-1 Env. THP-1 or monocytes were incubated with anti-CD4

612

antibody SK3 (Biolegend) and then added to the bead/plasma mixture. The mixture was

613

spinoculated for 1h at 4C followed by another 1h incubation at 37°C 87. The cells were washed

614

and fixed and fluorescence due to bead internalization was measured by flow cytometry. Positive

615

phagocytosis was determined by two criteria. First, values at week 84 were considered positive if

616

they were 3 standard deviations above values obtained in the prevaccination sample from the

617

same macaque. Second, values obtained at week 84 had to be >3-fold higher than the

618

prevaccination sample from the same macaque.

619

HIV-1 neutralization. Neutralization assays were performed in TZM-bl cells using 293T-

620

produced Env-pseudotyped viruses in a 96-well format as described 88. Neutralization titers are

621

the serum dilution at which relative luminescence units (RLUs) plotted on a non-linear

622

regression curve were reduced by 50% compared to virus control wells after subtraction of

623

background RLUs in uninfected cell control wells.

624

ELISA binding of plasma IgG to Zika E protein. ELISA binding was performed as described

625

previously 89. ZIKV envelope or HIV-1 proteins were coated overnight at 4°C on the wells of

626

384-well plates (Corning Life Sciences). Each protein was coated at 2 μg/mL in 15 μl in sodium

627

bicarbonate. Each well of the plate was blocked with assay diluent (PBS containing 4% [wt/vol]

628

whey protein–15% normal goat serum–0.5% Tween 20–0.05% sodium azide) for 2 h at room

629

temperature. Blocking solution was aspirated from each well and 10 μL of serially-diluted

630

macaque sera were added to the plate and incubated for 90 min. The plate was washed with PBS-

631

Tween-20. Ten microliters of horse radish peroxidase anti-macaque IgG Fc was added to each

632

well of the plate and incubated for 1 h. Subsequently, the plate was washed with PBS-Tween-20

633

and 30 μL of SureBlue substrate was used to visualize the presence of horse radish peroxidase.

634

After 5-15 min the reaction was stopped with 15 μL of 0.1M HCl. Absorbance at 405nm was

635

read for each well using a VersaMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Binding titers

636

observed for the prevaccination timepoint were subtracted from the post vaccination timepoint

637

for macaques that were part of mRNA-LNP dose study.

638

ZIKV MR-766 plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT). Serum neutralization was

639

assessed as detailed previously 1. Fifty plaque forming units of ZIKV strain MR-766 (African

640

lineage, Uganda, 1947, GenBank: AY632535) (UTMB Arbovirus Reference Collection) were

641

incubated with increasing dilutions of heat-inactivated sera in serum-free DMEM (Corning)

642

medium for 1 h at 37°C. The virus/serum mixture was added to a confluent monolayer of Vero

643

cells for 1.5 h at 37°C with intermittent rocking. Three ml of overlay, containing a final

644

concentration of 0.5% methylcellulose (4,000 centipoise) (Sigma), 1X DMEM (Gibco), 16 mM

645

HEPES, 0.56% sodium bicarbonate, 1.6X GlutaMAX (Gibco), 1X penicillin/streptomycin

646

(Corning), and 4 μg/ml amphotericin B (Gibco), was added to each well. Plates were incubated

647

for 5 days at 37°C in 5% CO2. After incubation, the overlay was aspirated, cells were fixed and

648

stained with 0.5% crystal violet (Sigma) in 25% methanol, 75% deionized water, rinsed with

649

deionized water, and plaques inspected. Neutralization titers (EC50) were calculated as the

650

reciprocal dilution of sera required for 50% neutralization of infection. EC50 titers below the

651

limit of detection are reported as half of the limit of detection.

652

Zika reporter virus particle (RVP) neutralization assay. RVP neutralization assays were

653

performed as described elsewhere1. RVPs were diluted to ensure antibody excess at informative

654

portions of the antibody dose response curve and incubated for 1 h at 37°C with serial dilutions

655

of heat-inactivated macaque sera to allow for steady-state binding. Serum-RVP mixtures were

656

subsequently mixed with Raji-DCSIGNR cells at 37°C. Each serum sample was tested in to

657

technical replicates. Every assay was repeated in two biologically-independent assays. GFP-

658

positive infected cells were detected by flow cytometry 24–48 hr later. The EC50 was estimated

659

using a non-linear regression with a variable slope (GraphPad Prism). The initial dilution of sera

660

(based on the final volume of RVPs, cells, and sera) was set as the limit of quantification of the

661

assay. EC50 titers below the limit of quantification were reported as a titer half the limit of

662

quantification.

663

Statistical analyses. Descriptive statistics were calculated and reported for each assay. Group

664

means, standard error, and geometric means were calculated with GraphPad Prism 8. Log area-

665

under-the-curve (AUC) was calculated by Softmax Pro. EC50 titers for RVP neutralization were

666

analyzed by non-linear regression to estimate the reciprocal dilution of sera required for half-

667

maximal neutralization of infection (EC50 titer). The geometric mean of duplicate RVP

668

neutralization EC50 titers were calculated using GraphPad Prism 8.
