Abstract

51

A safe, efficacious and deployable vaccine is urgently needed to control COVID-19

52

pandemic. We report here the preclinical development of a COVID-19 vaccine

53

candidate, ZF2001, which contains tandem-repeat dimeric receptor-binding domain

54

(RBD) protein with alum-based adjuvant. We assessed vaccine immunogenicity and

55

efficacy in both mice and non-human primates (NHPs). ZF2001 induced high levels of

56

RBD-binding and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in both mice and NHPs, and also

57

elicited balanced TH1/TH2 cellular responses in NHPs. Two doses of ZF2001 protected

58

Ad-hACE2-transduced mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection, as detected by reduced

59

viral RNA and relieved lung injuries. In NHPs, vaccination of either 25 μg or 50 μg

60

ZF2001 prevented infection with SARS-CoV-2 in lung, trachea and bronchi, with milder

61

lung lesions. No evidence of disease enhancement is observed in both models.

62

ZF2001 is being evaluated in the ongoing international multi-center Phase 3 trials

63

(NCT04646590) and has been approved for emergency use in Uzbekistan.

Introduction
As of Feb 14, 2021, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by

67

severe

68

(Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of, 2020;

69

Jiang et al., 2020) has led to more than 100 million confirmed cases, with more than 2

70

million deaths (www.who.int). Vaccine is the “final solution” to control the pandemic.

71

After 1 year of global efforts, a number of COVID-19 vaccines have been advanced

72

into Phase 3 clinical trials (Dai and Gao, 2021). Several of them are approved for use

73

in many countries, including mRNA vaccines, adenovirus vectored vaccines,

74

inactivated vaccines and a protein subunit vaccine presented here (Anderson et al.,

75

2020; Folegatti et al., 2020; Jackson et al., 2020; Logunov et al., 2020; Mulligan et al.,

76

2020; Ramasamy et al., 2020; Sadoff et al., 2021; Sahin et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2020;

77

Zhang et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020a; Zhu et al., 2020b). These approved vaccines

78

mainly target whole virus or spike (S) protein (Dai and Gao, 2021). Different vaccines

79

with

80

countermeasure to systemically stop the COVID-19 pandemic. Protein subunit

81

represents as an important avenue to develop COVID-19 vaccines, with more than 80

82

vaccine candidates documented in World Health Organization (www.who.int).

83

Currently, three protein subunit vaccines have been advanced in Phase 3 or 2/3 clinical

84

trials, with two of them (NVX-CoV2327 and SCB-2019) using S protein as the antigen

85

(Keech et al., 2020; Richmond et al., 2021).

87

receptor-binding domain (RBD) (Dai et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 RBD

88

located at C-terminal domain of S1 subunit in S protein, and is responsible for

89

engagement of its cellular receptor human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2)

90

(Wang et al., 2020). RBD is an attractive coronavirus vaccine target because it focuses

91

the antibody response to blocking receptor binding, therefore, poses low potential for

92

antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) risk (Dai and Gao, 2021; Dai et al., 2020;

93

Walls et al., 2020). To increase the immunogenicity, we designed a tandem-repeat

94

dimeric RBD as the antigen for COVID-19 vaccine (Dai et al., 2020). Compared to the

95

traditional monomeric RBD, RBD-dimer significantly enhanced the SARS-CoV-2

96

neutralizing antibodies produced in mice (Dai et al., 2020). We produced the RBD-

97

dimer in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell system, formulated with aluminum

98

hydroxide as adjuvant. The resulting vaccine, ZF2001, is being evaluated in Phase 1

99

(NCT04445194, NCT04550351) and 2 (NCT04466085) clinical trials in China, showing

100

good safety and immunogenicity (Yang et al., 2020). ZF2001 is now evaluated in

101

international multi-center Phase 3 clinical trials (NCT04646590) and approved for

102

emergency use in Uzbekistan. Here, we report the preclinical studies of ZF2001 in both

103

mouse and non-human primate (NHP) models.

Tandem-repeat RBD-dimer protein in ZF2001 vaccine

107

The RBD construct for SARS-CoV-2 started at S protein residue R319 and stopped

108

at residue K537. Two copies of RBD were connected as tandem repeat dimer (Figure

1A). The construct of RBD-dimer was transformed into clinical-grade CHO cell lines.

110

Cell lines with highest antigen yields were selected for scaling-up antigen production

111

in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice. The tandem-repeat RBD-

112

dimer antigen was further purified and characterized (Dai et al., 2020). The CHO-

113

generated RBD-dimer bound to hACE2 with affinity similar as RBD-monomer,

114

indicating the correctly exposure of receptor-binding motif (Figure S1). Stock solution

115

was further formulated with aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant and put into vials as

116

ZF2001 vaccine.

117
118

ZF2001 vaccine immunogenicity in mice

119

To study the vaccine immunogenicity, groups of BALB/c mice were vaccinated with

120

two doses of 10 μg ZF2001, 21 days apart. Mice receiving placebo (adjuvant-only)

121

were used as the negative control. Serum samples were collected at different time

122

points post vaccination to monitor the duration of antibody responses (Figure 1B). One

123

immunization of ZF2001 vaccine induced a geometric mean titer (GMT) of 557 for

124

serological RBD-binding IgG (Day 19), and this titer was further increased to 47,051

125

after a second immunization (Day 35) (Figure 1C). For vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2

126

neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), the GMT was 256 after two immunizations at Day 35

127

(Figure 1D). These titers remain high for each time point until our latest sampling at

128

Day 140, with GMTs of RBD-binding IgG from 188,203 to 432,376 (Figure 1C), and

129

GMTs of SARS-CoV-2 NAb from 294 to 388 (Figure 1D), suggesting the durable

130

humoral responses induced by ZF2001.

ZF2001-elicited protection in Ad5-hACE2 transduced mice

133

To study the protective efficacy of ZF2001 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection,

134

groups of C57/B6 mice were immunized with two doses of 10 μg ZF2001, 21 days

135

apart (Figure 2A). Mice receiving placebo were used as the control. Two doses of

136

ZF2001 vaccine elicited high levels of both RBD-binding IgG (GMT, 81,920) and

137

SARS-CoV-2 NAb (GMT, 959) (Figure 2B and 2C). These immunized mice were

138

subsequently transduced via intranasal route with adenovirus expressing hACE2 as

139

the SARS-CoV-2-sensitive animal model. Five days later, these transduced mice were

140

intranasally challenged with 5 X 105 or 1 X 105 50% tissue culture infectious dose

141

(TCID50) of SARS-CoV-2 (HB01 strain) (Wei et al., 2020; Tan et al., 2020). Mice were

142

euthanized and necropsied at 3 or 5 days post infection (DPI) to detect viral loads and

143

exam pulmonary pathology. Encouragingly, in mice challenged with 5 X 105 TCID50

144

SARS-CoV-2, the mean titers of viral genomic RNA (gRNA) per gram of lung for

145

placebo and ZF2001 group were 6.5 x 108 and 3.0 x 106 (218-fold reduction),

146

respectively, at 3 DPI, and 7.0 x 108 and 4.8 x 105 (1,448-fold reduction), respectively,

147

at 5 DPI (Figure 2D). In mice challenged with 1 X 105 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2, the mean

148

gRNA titers for placebo and ZF2001 group, were 2.3 x 109 and 1.2 x 105, respectively,

149

a reduction of 18,736-fold. The residual viral RNA in lung were probably derived from

150

the high amount of input viruses. Therefore, we measured the magnitudes of

151

subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) to quantify the infectious virus because sgRNA are

152

generated in the infected cells during virus replication but is absent in virions (Kim et

153

al., 2020). In mice challenged with 5 X 105 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2, the mean titers of viral

154

sgRNA per gram of lung for placebo recipients were 3.6 x 108 and 5.1 x 108 at 3 DPI

155

and 5 DPI, respectively. By contrast, this titer was reduced to 1.4 x 106 at 3 DPI and

156

undetectable at 5 DPI for ZF2001 vaccine recipients (Figure 3B). Accordingly, in mice

157

challenged with 1 X 105 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2, these sgRNA titer was 8.1 x 108 for

158

placebo recipients, but was undetectable for ZF2001 recipients, at 3 DPI (Figure 2E).

159

The neutralizing titers are negatively correlated with the gRNA and sgRNA, with

160

Spearman correlation r value of -0.7127 and -0.6982, respectively (Figure 2F).

161

Consistent with this, immunofluorescence analysis of lung section stained with anti-

162

SARS-CoV-2 NP antibody demonstrated the presence of viral protein in mice receiving

163

placebo, but absence in mice receiving ZF2001 vaccine (Figure 3A). These results

164

demonstrated that ZF2001 vaccine is protective against pulmonary SARS-CoV-2

165

infection.

166

To further assess the vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage,

167

histopathological examination was performed. All lung tissue samples harvested from

168

mice with placebo exhibited apparently moderated to severe viral pneumonia,

169

characterized by thickened alveolar walls, vanishment of alveolar cavities, pulmonary

170

vascular congestion and diffuse inflammatory cell infiltration (Figure 3B). By contrast,

171

a markedly relieved histopathological changes were observed in lung tissues of mice

172

vaccinated with ZF2001 vaccine (Figure 3B). This result demonstrated that ZF2001

173

protected against SARS-CoV-2-induced lung injury in mice, without observation of

174

vaccine enhanced diseases.

ZF2001 vaccine immunogenicity in cynomolgus macaques

177

To further evaluate ZF2001 vaccine in NHPs, groups of healthy young cynomolgus

178

macaques (n=10) were immunized with four doses of 25 μg or 50 μg vaccine

179

intramuscularly at Week 0, 4, 8 and 10, respectively, to monitor the immunogenicity

180

kinetics (Figure 4A). We found after one immunization, ZF2001 vaccine can elicit

181

serological RBD-binding IgG GMTs up to ~100,000 in both the 25 μg or 50 μg groups,

182

and these titers were further enhanced to more than 1000,000 after the second

183

immunization (Figure 4B). The third and fourth boosts did not significantly increase the

184

GMTs (Figure 4B). For the NAb response, two immunizations of ZF2001 vacine elicited

185

SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing GMTs of 630 in the 25 μg group and 776 in the 50 μg group,

186

respectively. The third immunization did not further enhance NAb titer (Figure 4C).

187

To detect the cellular immune responses in NHPs, 6 macaques in each group were

188

euthanized to harvest spleen at 3 days after the last vaccination. Splenocytes were

189

stimulated with RBD protein. ELISPOT assay was perform to detect TH1 (IFN-γ, IL-2)

190

and TH2 (IL-4) cytokine production. We found both 25 μg or 50 μg ZF2001 induced

191

substantial cellular responses, with the significantly enhanced and TH1/TH2 balanced

192

cytokine production (Figure 4D).

193

Overall, macaques receiving 50 μg vaccine did not show enhanced immunogenicity

194

compared to those receiving 25 μg vaccine for both humoral and cellular immune

195

responses.

ZF2001-elicited protection in rhesus macaques

198

To assess the protection efficacy, we immunized healthy young rhesus macaques

199

(n=3) with two doses of 25 μg or 50 μg vaccine intramuscularly, 21 days apart (Figure

200

5A). Macaques receiving placebo was used as the control. Both 25 μg and 50 μg

201

ZF2001 vaccine elicited high levels of serological RBD-binding IgG and SARS-CoV-2

202

neutralizing antibody after one or two immunizations. For RBD-binding IgG, the GMTs

203

reached 6,451 for both the 25 μg and 50 μg groups after the first immunization (Figure

204

5B). After the second immunization, the GMTs further raised to 100,794 and 80,000 for

205

the 25 μg and 50 μg group, respectively, at Day 28 (Figure 5B). No significant increase

206

was observed at Day 35, with the GMTs of 63,496 for the 25 μg group and 50,397 for

207

the 50 μg group (Figure 5B). For SARS-CoV-2 NAbs, two immunizations of ZF2001

208

vaccine elicited GMTs of 256 for the 25 μg group and 161 for the 50 μg group at Day

209

28 (Figure 7C). No significant increase was observed at Day 35, with the GMTs of 203

210

for the 25 μg group and 256 for the 50 μg group (Figure 5C). The 50 μg group did not

211

show enhanced immunogenicity compared to the 25 μg group in macaques.

212

The macaques were challenged with 1 X 106 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 intratracheally at

213

Day 28 post vaccination. Macaques were euthanized at 8 DPI. Tissues from 7 lung

214

lobes (4 sites in each lobe), trachea, left and right bronchus were collected and

215

quantified for viral gRNA. As expected, substantial virus loads can be detected in lung

216

lobes (average 4748 copies/μg gRNA). By contrast, animals receiving either 25 μg or

217

50 μg ZF2001 vaccine exhibited significantly reduced virus loads in lung lobes, with

218

average 1 and 10 copies/μg gRNA for 25 μg and 50 μg group, respectively. In addition,

219

viral gRNA was detected in trachea and bronchi from 1 or 2 macaques receiving

220

placebo, but was undetectable in all ZF2001-vaccinated macaques (Figure 6A).

221

To further assess the protection efficacy in lung, pulmonary histopathology of each

222

macaque was scored based on the thickening of alveolar septa, pulmonary alveolar

223

congestion and inflammatory cell infiltration in alveoli and trachea. Overall, high scores

224

of lung lesions were found in control animals, but were dramatically reduced in

225

ZF2001-vaccinated animals (Figure 6B). In particular, all three control animals showed

226

severe pulmonary alveolar congestion. By contrast, macaques receiving either 25 μg

227

or 50 μg vaccine showed almost no alveolar congestion (Figure 6B and 6C). The

228

typical images of tissue hematoxylin-eosin (H/E) staining were shown in the Figure 6C.

229

We did not observe vaccine enhanced diseases in all these macaques.

230
231

Discussion

232

ZF2001 is a tandem-repeat dimeric RBD protein COVID-19 vaccine currently under

233

Phase 3 clinical trials (NCT04646590) and emergency use in Uzbekistan. Here, we

234

report its preclinical results in animal models of both mice and NHP. ZF2001 vaccine

235

was highly immunogenic in both mouse and NHP models, with high neutralizing GMTs

236

against SARS-CoV-2. Two shots of vaccine protected both hACE2-transduced mice

237

and NHPs against SARS-CoV-2 infection. No evidence of vaccine enhanced diseases

238

was found in both models. Compared with the other two protein subunit vaccines

239

advanced in Phase 3 or 2/3 clinical trials (NVX-CoV2373 and SCB-2019) using full-

240

length S protein as antigen, ZF2001 vaccine is an RBD-based protein vaccine aiming

241

to focus immune responses in receptor-binding blocking, with a unique design of dimer

242

for better stability and immunogenicity (Dai et al., 2020). Besides, ZF2001 vaccine

243

uses a traditional alum-based adjuvant with long safety profiles in humans, rather than

244

the relatively new adjuvants used in NVX-CoV2373 (Matrix-M) and SCB-2019 (AS03

245

or CpG1018+Alum) (Keech et al., 2020; Richmond et al., 2021). Besides, ZF2001 is

246

stable in 2-8 oC and allows scalable manufacturing due to its high antigen yields (Dai

247

et al., 2020). This highlights its advantage of vaccine deployment to meet the global

248

vaccine demands. Therefore, the encouraging preclinical results suggest that ZF2001

249

vaccine with different vaccine target, different adjuvant and different mechanism of

250

action would diversify the current vaccine pipelines.

251

In NHPs models, the higher vaccine dose (50 μg) did not show a superior immune

252

response or better protection compared to the lower vaccine dose (25 μg). We

253

speculate that 25 μg dose has already reached or is near to a saturated dosage to

254

stimulate immune system. Larger dose may not further increase the immunogenicity.

255

On the contrary, sometimes larger dose may decrease the protection as reported for

256

an adenovirus-based vaccine AZD1222 (Voysey et al., 2021). The similar

257

immunological trend was also observed in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials (Yang et al.,

258

2020). This preclinical results in NHPs support the use of 25 μg vaccine dose to an

259

ongoing Phase 3 large scale evaluation for safety and efficacy.

Mouse experiments

508

Female BALB/c mice and female C57BL/6 mice were immunized intramuscularly

509

(i.m) with ZF2001 (10 μg dose antigen) or placebo and boosted with equal dose of

510

vaccine at day 21 post priming. Serum samples were collected after vaccination as

511

indicated in figures legends.

512

For challenge experiment, C57BL/6 mice were intranasally (i.n.) transduced with 8

513

x 108 vp of Ad5-hACE2 as a mouse model for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Hassan et al.,

514

2020). Five days later, the transduced mice were infected with 5 x 105 or 1 x 105 TCID50

515

of SARS-CoV-2 (HB01 strain) via i.n. route. The mice were euthanized and necropsied

516

3 days after challenge. Lung tissues were collected for virus titration and pathological

517

examination. All mice experiments with SARS-CoV-2 challenge were conducted under

518

animal biosafety level 3 (ABSL3) in IMCAS.

519

Monkey experiments

520

Cynomolgus macaques were divided into three groups (n=10), with five females

521

weighing 2.97 to 3.62 kg and five males weighing 2.95 to 3.67 kg in each group.

522

Macaques were immunized with 25 μg or 50 μg ZF2001 vaccine via i.m. route at Week

523

0, 4, 8 and 10. Group receiving placebo was used as the control. Serum samples were

524

Rhesus macaques at 3 to 6 years of age were divided into three groups (n=3), with

528

one female and two male monkeys in each group. Macaques were immunized with

529

two doses of 25 μg or 50 μg ZF2001 via i.m. route, 21 days apart. Serum samples

530

were collected for detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies.

531

For challenge experiment, rhesus macaques were infected with 2×106TCID50 of

532

SARS-CoV-2 (20SF107 strain) via intratracheal route. The experimental animals were

533

anesthetized by injection of Zoletil 50 (Virbac, France) into the thigh muscle.

534

Euthanasia was performed on Day 8 after the challenge. Tissues from lungs (7 lobes

535

with 4 sites in each lobe), trachea, left and right bronchus were collected for viral

536

genomic RNA quantification and histopathology staining.

537

Protein expression and purification

538

Monomeric RBD protein of SARS-CoV-2 used in ELISA assay was expressed and

539

purified as previously described (Dai et al., 2020). Briefly, the coding sequence for

540

SARS-CoV-2 RBD (S protein 319-541, GISAID accession No. EPI_ISL_402119) was

541

codon-optimized for mammalian cell expression and synthesized. For this construct,

542

signal peptide sequence of MERS-CoV S protein (S protein residues 1-17) was added

543

to the protein N terminus for protein secretion, and a hexa-His tag was added to the C

544

terminus to facilitate further purification processes. The construct, which synthesized

545

by GENEWIZ, China, was cloned into the pCAGGS vector and transiently transfected

546

into HEK293T cells. After 3 days, the supernatant was collected and soluble protein

547

was purified by Ni affinity chromatography using a HisTrap

548

Healthcare). The sample was further purified via gel filtration chromatography with

ELISA

552

For mice and rhesus macaque, ELISA plates (3590; Corning, USA) were coated

553

over-night with 3 μg/ml of RBD protein in 0.05 M carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6,

554

and blocked in 5% skim milk in PBS. Serum samples were serially diluted and added

555

to each well. Plates were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody or goat

556

anti-monkey IgG-HRP antibody and subsequently developed with 3,3’,5,5’-

557

tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate. Reactions were stopped with 2 M hydrochloric

558

acid, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader

559

(PerkinElmer, USA). The endpoint titers were defined as the highest reciprocal dilution

560

of serum to give an absorbance greater than 2.5-fold of the background values.

561

Antibody titer below the limit of detection was determined as half the limit of detection.

562

For cynomolgus macaques, ELISA plates were coated over-night with 1 μg/ml of

563

RBD-dimer protein and blocked in 3% skim milk in PBST. Serum samples were serially

564

diluted and added to each well. 10ul serum from cynomolgus macaques of blank

565

control group was mixed as one blank control serum and diluted as the same with initial

566

fold of vaccine group. The subsequent operations were as described above. Cut off

567

value was defined 2.1-fold of OD450 values of the blank control serum. When OD450 >

568

Cut off value, the serum was determined positive. The endpoint titer was defined as

569

the highest reciprocal dilution of serum with an absorbance greater than 2.1-fold of the

570

blank control serum value. When OD450 value of the serum to test ≤ Cut off value, the

572

Live SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay

573

The neutralizing activity of serum was assessed using a previously described SARS-

574

CoV-2 neutralization assay (Nie et al., 2020). Briefly, mouse serum samples were 4-

575

fold serially diluted and mixed with the same volume of 100 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2, then

576

incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. Then, 100 μL virus-serum mixture was transferred to pre-

577

plated Vero cells in 96-well plates. Inoculated plates were incubated at 37°C for an

578

additional 72 hours to monitor the cytopathic effect (CPE) microscopically. The

579

neutralization titers were defined as the reciprocal of serum dilution required for 50%

580

neutralization of viral infection. All the live virus neutralization assay of mouse serum

581

samples was conducted under biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility in IMCAS, with SARS-

582

CoV-2 HB01 strain. The neutralizing activity of serum samples from macaques were

583

assessed with 2020XN4276 strain of SARS-CoV-2 in the same method as mentioned

584

above in Guangdong Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention

585

ELISPOT

586

To detect antigen-specific T cell responses, ELISPOT assay was performed as

587

previously described (Xu et al., 2018), with some modifications. Briefly, Flat-bottom,

588

Splenocytes of mice or cynomolgus macaques were added to the plate. Peptide pool

595

covering RBD of SARS-CoV-2 (2 μg/ml individual peptide) (for mouse) or RBD-dimer

596

protein of SARS-CoV-2 (for cynomolgus macaques) was added to the wells for

597

stimulation. Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was added as a positive control. Cells without

598

stimulation were employed as a negative control. After 12-36 hours of incubation, the

599

cells were removed, and the plates were processed with biotinylated IFN-γ, IL-2 or IL-

600

4 detection antibody, streptavidin-HRP conjugate, and substrate. When the colored

601

spots were intense enough to be observed, the development was stopped by

602

thoroughly rinsing samples with deionized water. The numbers of the spots were

603

determined using an automatic ELISPOT reader and image analysis software.

604

qRT-PCR for mice

605

Mice lung tissues were weighed and homogenized. Virus genomic RNA was isolated

606

from 50-μl supernatants of homogenized tissues using a nucleic acid extraction

607

638

peribronchiolitis, interstitial pneumonitis and alveolitis. All the rhesus macaque tissues

639

were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for minimum of seven days, then embedded in

640

paraffin, sectioned (slices 4 microns) for HE staining (Zhang et al., 2016).

641

Pulmonary histopathology of lung tissue was scored based on the thickening of

642

alveolar septa, pulmonary alveolar congestion and inflammatory cell infiltration in

643

alveoli and trachea. For thickening of alveola septa, no significant widened alveolar

644

septa was observed is scored 0; slightly widened alveolar septa with lesion range <

645

25% is scored 1; moderate widened, fused and consolidated alveolar septa with lesion

646

range 25%-50% is scored 2; severe widened, fused, consolidated alveolar septa with

647

lesion range 50%-75% is scored 3; extremely severe widened, fused, and consolidated

648

alveolar septa with lesion range ＞75% is scored 4. For inflammatory cell infiltration

649

and alveolar congestion, no lesion or disease variable is scored 0; mild/small lesions

650

with lesion range or disease variable < 25% is scored 1; moderate lesions with lesion

651

range or disease variable 25%-50% is scored 2; severe/multiple lesions with lesion

652

659

goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (Abways). DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-

660

phenylindole) was also incubated with the sections, followed by detection using laser

661

scanning confocal microscope (Leica).

662

SPR

663

Protein interactions were tested through SPR analysis and the experiments were

664

carried out at 25ºC using a BIAcore 3000 machine with CM5 chips (GE Healthcare).

665

All proteins for SPR analysis were exchanged to PBST (10 mM Na2HPO4; 2mM

666

KH2PO4, pH 7.4; 137 mM NaCl; 2.7 mM KCl; 0.005% Tween 20). SARS-CoV-2 RBD

667

proteins were immobilized onto CM5 chips and analyzed for real-time binding by

668

flowing through gradient concentrations of hACE2. The aforementioned RBD proteins

669

were immobilized on the chip at about 1000 response units (RUs). The concentrations

670

of hACE2 are 0,0.78125,1.5625,3.125,6.25,12.5,25,50,100, and 200nM. After each

671

cycle, the sensor surface was regenerated using 7 μl of 10 mM NaOH. Measurements

672

from the reference flow cell (immobilized with BSA) were subtracted from experimental

673

values. The binding kinetics were analyzed using 1:1 binding model with the software

674

BIAevaluation Version 4.1 (GE Healthcare).
