Abstract
Unsupervised AI (artificial intelligence) can obtain novel knowledge from big data
without particular models or prior knowledge and is highly desirable for unveiling
hidden features in big data. SARS-CoV-2 poses a serious threat to public health and one
important issue in characterizing this fast-evolving virus is to elucidate various aspects
of their genome sequence changes. We previously established unsupervised AI, a
BLSOM (batch-learning SOM), which can analyze five million genomic sequences
simultaneously. The present study applied the BLSOM to the oligonucleotide
compositions of forty thousand SARS-CoV-2 genomes. While only the oligonucleotide
composition was given, the obtained clusters of genomes corresponded primarily to
known main clades and internal divisions in the main clades. Since the BLSOM is
explainable AI, it reveals which features of the oligonucleotide composition are
responsible for clade clustering. The BLSOM has powerful image display capabilities
and enables efficient knowledge discovery about viral evolutionary processes.
Introduction
To confront the global threat of COVID-191,2, many SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences
have been rapidly decoded and promptly released through the GISAID database3. To
characterize this virus in various ways, we must implement diverse research methods
such as AI (artificial intelligence), that are suitable for big data analyses. Unsupervised
machine learning can obtain new information from big data without particular models
or presumptions and is highly desirable for mining big data. We previously established a
BLSOM (batch-learning self-organizing map) for oligonucleotide compositions, which
can reveal various new characteristics of genome sequences4,5.
Oligonucleotide composition varies significantly among species, even those with the
same genome G+C%, and is called the genome signature6. When we constructed a
BLSOM for oligonucleotide compositions in fragment sequences (e.g., 10 kb) from a
wide variety of species, the sequences were clustered (self-organized) primarily
according to species, despite no species information being used during machine
learning5,7. Importantly, the BLSOM is suitable for large-scale analysis and has been
used to analyze five million genomic fragments from over one thousand genera8. In
addition, the BLSOM is explainable AI and can reveal the drivers of species-specific
clustering (self-organization).
Many host factors (e.g., nucleotide pools, proteins and RNAs) and antiviral mechanisms
(e.g., antibodies, cytotoxic T cells and interferons) are involved in viral growth and
infection9,10. Since human cells may not present ideal growth conditions for zoonotic

viruses that have invaded from nonhuman hosts, efficient growth and human-human
transmission will likely require changes in the viral genome. To study this viral
adaptation, we previously analyzed time-series changes in the mono- and
oligonucleotide compositions of four zoonotic RNA viruses (influenza virus11,12, Zaire
ebolavirus13, MERS coronavirus13 and SARS-CoV-214) and identified time-series
directional changes that were detectable even on a monthly basis.
In the case of fast-evolving RNA viruses, diversity within the viral population arises
rapidly as the epidemic progresses and subpopulation structure forms, and the GISAID
consortium has defined seven main clades, and Mercatelli and Giorgi (2020)15 have
recently conducted a large-scale search for prevalent mutations worldwide. In the
present study, over 40,000 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 are analyzed by using BLSOMs
with oligonucleotides of various lengths. The BLSOM is a sequence alignment-free
method, and during machine learning, only the oligonucleotide composition of each
viral genome is given. Therefore, clustering is performed basing only on the similarity
of oligonucleotide compositions. By trying various oligonucleotide lengths, we obtained
conditions for separating the known clades with high accuracy. Since the BLSOM is
explicable AI, it can identify the features of oligonucleotide compositions responsible
for the separation. Since the BLSOM method is based on a completely different
principle than conventional clade assignment based on sequence alignment, additional
information can be obtained.
Results
BLSOM for 1 ~ 6-mers. In the present study, over forty thousand SARS-CoV-2
genomes, which have been isolated from December 2019 to June 2020, were analyzed;
polyA-tail was removed prior to all analyses. Figure 1 shows the BLSOM results for the
mono- to hexanucleotide compositions in the viral genomes; importantly, only the
composition was used in the learning process. The total number of nodes (grid points)
was set to 1/20 of the total number of viral genomes (40,450); therefore, each node had
an average of 20 genomes. After learning, to determine if the separation by the BLSOM
was related to known clads, grid points containing genomes of a single clade were
colored to indicate each clade, and grid points containing those of multiple clades were
displayed in black. Figure 1 shows that most grid points in the mononucleotide BLSOM
are black, indicating that the genome sequences are not separated by clade. However,
for greater than dinucleotide lengths, the separation by clade gradually becomes clear.
While each node has 20 genomes on average, and even though grids containing at least
one genome belonging to another clade are marked in black, a major portion of the grids

in the BLSOM for 4- to 6-mers are colored, showing the good classification power of
the BLSOM. We thus tested oligonucleotides longer than 6-mers.

BLSOMs were constructed for
mono- to hexa-nucleotide
compositions in 40,450 genome
sequences. The total number of
nodes was set to 1/20 of the total
number of viral genomes. Grid
points that include sequences from
more than one clade are indicated in
black, and those containing
sequences from a single clade are indicated in a clade-specific color: G ( ), GH ( ), GR ( ), L ( ), S
( ) and V ( ). Sequences of the O clade (other and unclassified clades) were included in the BLSOM
calculation but excluded from the final display; i.e., if a sequence belonging to the O clade is mixed
with sequences belonging to a main clade, the node is colored according to the main clade.

BLSOM for 7-mers. For 7-mers, the BLSOM handles 16,384 (the 7th power of 4)
variables, and for efficient analysis, some modification of PCA used to set the initial
state for machine learning is required, as described in the Methods. The BLSOM with
this minor modification provides
good separation by clade (Fig. 2ai).

BLSOM is explainable AI and can provide information about the oligonucleotides
responsible for the clustering (Fig. 2aii); the representative vector for each node is
composed of 16,384 variables, and the contribution levels of the variables at each node
can be visualized by a heatmap: high (red), moderate (white) and low (blue)16. In Fig.
2aii, two examples of 7-mers are presented; UAGCGCU has a high occurrence (red)
primarily in GH zones (mandarin orange), whereas GAGCGCU, which differs from the
former by one underlined base, has a low occurrence (blue) there. When considering all
7-mer patterns (refer to Supplementary Fig. S1), we observed multiple cases in which
occurrence levels visualized as red/blue were reversed for a pair of 7-mers with a
one-base difference, as shown in Fig. 2aii. Notably, these reverse patterns were
primarily observed for individual clade territories, indicating that one-base differences
may be related to mutations involved in clade separation.
Necessity for dimension reduction. Notably, most 7-mers existed in multiple copies
in the viral genomes; therefore, a one-base difference giving the red/blue reverse pattern
could not be connected uniquely to a mutation in the viral genome. In other words,
extending the oligonucleotide length until most k-mers were present as one copy per
genome should allow us to connect one-base differences to mutations. Accordingly, we
calculated the occurrences of long oligonucleotides in the viral genomes, and when the
length was extended to 15-mers, most showed one copy per genome. The 15-mers,
however, included over one billion types (the 15th power of 4), and even for those that
appeared in the viral genomes, there were more than 0.3 million types. A strategy for
dimension reduction is essential for efficient analyses; then we examined the effects of
dimension reduction on clade separation by testing 7-mers again.
In Supplementary Fig. S1, most 7-mers are red/blue all over and very locally dotted
with blue/red, respectively. These 7-mers are thought to correspond to sequences that
have not mutated in most strains or that arose by mutations but remain in only a small
number of strains. The oligonucleotides whose frequency in the viral population has not
significantly changed with time should not be involved in the formation of main
subpopulations, such as the main clades. To exclude these numerous 7-mers and select
those that have changed significantly in occurrence during the pandemic, we first
tabulated viral strains for each month of collection and calculated the 7-mer occurrence
frequency therein. To compare the frequencies in the June (2020) and December (2019)
populations, we next selected 7-mers whose frequency in the June population
increased/decreased by at least 0.1 compared with that in the December population.
We constructed a BLSOM with these 255 selected 7-mers (Fig. 2b). Even using a very

minor portion of the 7-mers (255/16384 = 0.016), good separation by clade was
observed, but the mutual separation of L, S and V clades, which are prevalent in Asia,
was poor. This should be because strains belonging to these clades were very minor in
the June population.
To study evolutionary processes throughout the epidemic phase, we must consider an
intermediate phase and choose the March population here; then we selected 7-mers
whose frequency in the March population increased/decreased by at least 0.1 compared
with that in the December population. The 334 obtained 7-mers were combined with the
June 7-mers used in Fig. 2b. After excluding duplicates, we constructed a BLSOM for
the 377 remaining 7-mers. Importantly, the BLSOM separation (Fig. 3ci) was clearer
than that observed when using 16384 types of 7-mers (Fig. 3ai), and the red/blue reverse
pattern was clearly connected to clade separation; for four clades, Fig. 2cii presents a
pair of red/blue patterns corresponding to a pair of 7-mers with a one-base difference,
and Supplementary Fig. S2 presents all red/blue patterns. Since the dimension-reduction
strategy appeared to be useful, we applied it to the 15-mer BLSOM.
BLSOM for 15-mers. Most 15-mers have only one copy in the viral genome as
mentioned above. More precisely, ten 15-mers have had two copies since December
2019, and the two copies are present in almost all strains until June, so these 15-mers
are unrelated to mutations with significant changes in population frequency during the
pandemic. As performed for 7-mers in Fig. 2c, we selected 15-mers whose frequency in
the March/June population increased/decreased by at least 0.1 compared with that in the
December population and obtained 587 different 15-mers.

15-mers and their heatmap patterns. (i) The upper and lower panels plot the monthly occurrences of
15-mers according to the elapsed month, which are related to the M1~4 mutations in Table 1 (see
also Supplementary Fig. S3) and indicated by dark and light brown in b, respectively. Since there is
little difference among the sixty 15-mers, the relationship between each 15-mer and the colored
symbol was not described. (ii) Heatmaps of four pairs of 15-mers with a one-base difference; the
four in the upper and lower panels show heatmaps of the pre- and postmutation sequences. (d) (i)
The upper and lower panels plot monthly occurrences of a group of fifteen 15-mers belonging to the
second largest class specified by dark and light blue, respectively. Here, the pre- and postmutation
15-mers are plotted in the same figure: M5 and M7 mutations in Table 1. (ii) Heatmaps of two pairs
of 15-mers with one-base differences are placed next to the corresponding time-series diagram.

Because a maximum of one copy of these 15-mers was present in the genome, the
occurrence frequency of a given 15-mer in a certain population corresponds to the
frequency of the strains having the 15-mer sequence. The BLSOM with the 587
different 15-mers (Fig. 3a) showed good separation by clade. While each node has 50
genomes on average, and even though grids containing at least one genome belonging
to another clade are marked in black, a major portion of the grids are colored. Next, we
will examine why this good separation was obtained by focusing only on these 15-mers.
15-mers with rapidly changing population frequencies. The novel characteristic of
evolutionary study of this fast-evolving virus is near-future prediction and verification
on a monthly basis. We previously performed a time-series analysis of 20-mer
occurrences in over ten thousand SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated from December 2019 to
April 2020 and identified seven mutations rapidly increasing in population frequency14;
for all 20-mers, we created a histogram of increase levels in the April population
compared with the December population and identified the rapidly increasing mutations.
Here, we conducted a similar histogram analysis of over 250,000 types of 15-mers
found in over forty thousand viral genomes; we analyzed the occurrence level of each
15-mer on a monthly basis. Figure 3b is a histogram of the differences in 15-mer
frequency between the June and December populations.
On the horizontal axis, the frequency difference relative to December is displayed, and
on the vertical axis, the number of 15-mer types with the frequency difference in a 0.04
range is displayed. In the first histogram, the numbers of 15-mer types are displayed as
normal values. In the center, where the frequency difference is close to zero, there is a
very high peak, showing that most 15-mers underwent little change in population
frequency from December; i.e., most 15-mer sequences did not mutated, or if they did,

they did not spread significantly in the population. These 15-mers are not responsible
for formation of main subpopulations such as main clades.
In the other histogram, the vertical axis is displayed logarithmically to show low values.
Interestingly, there are clear characteristic peaks near both ends where the
increase/decrease in frequency exceeds 0.9 (colored in dark and light brown,
respectively), which has a logarithmic value of 1.778 (= 60); i.e., 60 types of 15-mers
that belong to the dark/light brown peak have drastically increased/decreased in
population frequency, respectively. The BLASTn analysis of a total of 120 types of the
15-mers against a standard viral genome sequence17,18 showed that these 120 types were
related to four mutations, which correspond to four of the seven mutations that were
previously found to be rapidly increasing in population frequency14. Since the fifteen
15-mers with one mutation can be represented as one 29-mer sequence, the pre- and
postmutation sequences of the 29-mers are presented in Supplementary Fig. S3.
In the upper and lower panels of Fig. 3ci, the monthly population frequencies of the
increasing/decreasing 15-mers are arranged according to the elapsed month. Since these
15-mers are the pairs produced by mutations, the two panels show symmetrical
time-series changes. Notably, these mutations were previously found to increase
monotonically to a frequency of 0.84 until April and continued to increase to 0.94 until
June, supporting the monotonic increase tend reported in the previous study14.
Reverse red/blue patterns for 15-mers. In the BLSOM shown in Fig. 3a, the
representative vector for each node is composed of 587 variables, and the contribution
level of each variable at each node can be visualized by a red/blue heatmap (Fig. 3cii).
Since fifteen pairs of 15-mers related to one mutation showed primarily the same
red/blue patter, one example of each mutation is presented in Fig. 3cii; the upper and
lower panels show the patterns for the pre- and postmutation 15-mers, respectively.
Notably, for the four mutations, very similar red/blue reverse patterns were observed,
which correspond to the separation of G (red), GH (mandarin orange) and GR (yellow
green) territories from L (green), S (cyan) and V (blue) territories of the Asian-type.
In addition to dark and light brown peaks in the logarithmic histogram, characteristic
peaks are also observed at positions apart from the central peaks, whose
increases/decreases exceed 0.2, and are specified by dark/light blue; the number of
peaks on the increase side (dark blue) is smaller than that on the decrease side (light
blue), and the BLASTn analysis of 15-mers belonging to the dark blue peaks revealed
that they are related to the two mutations (M5 and M7 in Table 1), which were also
reported previously14. In Fig. 3di, the time-series changes of increasing and decreasing

15-mers are plotted in the same panel.
Mutations involved in main clade separation. We next explain details of the six
mutations described in Fig. 3. Table 1 lists the nucleotide and amino-acid changes and
the clade territories in the BLSOM where the mutated sequences are located (i.e., the
red region in the heatmap) along with the day of first isolation of the strain with the
respective mutation. When the red region corresponds primarily to the entire territory of
a certain clad, the suffix "a" is added, and when the red region is a part of a certain clade
territory but is a continuous zone, "i" and "ii" are used to distinguish the separate zone.
In addition, when the red areas are scattered in a clade, they are noted by "p". The
sequences with the first four mutations (M1-4) are specified as Ga, GHa and GRa,
because the mutated sequences exist in the entire areas of G, GH and GR; these
mutations are thought to relate to the separation of G and its offspring GH and GR,
which are prevalent in Europe, from the Asian-types L, S and V. The first isolation date
for these mutations was 1/24 in Sichuan or Zhejiang in China, and the second isolation
date was 1/28 in Germany or Lishui in China. The sequences with the M5 or M7
mutation were localized in GHa or GRa, respectively, showing that the mutations should
relate to the separation of GH and GR from G; the first isolation date of M5 and M7
was 2/4 in the USA and 2/16 in England, respectively.

Consistency in identifying mutations with the phylogenetic clustering method.
With a phylogenetic method using NUCMER19 for sequence alignment, Mercatelli and
Giorgi (2020)15 have conducted a large-scale search for common mutations worldwide
and compared them with ten known mutations that have been associated with main
clade separation by the GISAID consortium. The genomic positions of the ten mutations
are shown in bold in the Relation column in Table 1, and when our identified locations

matched the mutations reported by Mercatelli and Giorgi (2020)15, they were underlined.
Our analysis relies only on BLSOM, histogram and time-series analyses of
oligonucleotide composition, all of which are sequence alignment-free methods. The
degree to which these different methods give similar results is important for knowing
the reliability of the method. The six mutations assigned in the analysis of Fig. 3c and d
were found to be among the ten known mutations and thus were underlined. Notably, in
Fig. 3c and d, the 15-mers whose increase/decrease was remarkable to others and
exceeded 0.2 in the histogram of Fig. 3bii were analyzed. Since the BLSOM shown in
Fig. 3a targeted the 15-mers with an increase/decrease of at least 0.1, it contains all of
these prominent 15-mers, resulting in a good separation according to main clades.
In addition, since the BLSOM targeted the 15-mers with an increase/decrease of at least
0.1, the time-series change and heatmap pattern can be obtained for more 15-mers than
those analyzed in Fig. 3c and d, and Fig. 4a~g present the additional results showing the
reverse pattern for both the time-series change and the heatmap diagram. In Figs. 4a for
M6 and 4b for M8, differential parts of the GH territory are red, showing the internal
branching of GH; M6 first appeared on 2/4 in the USA, and M8 appeared on 2/28 in
Canada. In Fig. 4c for M9, the red area covers the V territory, and this mutation was first
isolated on 1/17 in Yunnan and among the ten mutations. Figures 4d for M10 and 4e for
M11 show that the red area covers the S territory, indicating that the two mutations,
which first appeared in the same strain isolated on 1/5 in Wuhan, are related to the S
separation. Since M11 (but not M10) is a synonymous mutation and has been lost in
some S-clade strains since 1/23, M11 may be a hitchhiker-type neutral mutation that has
increased with M10.

In the case of M12 (Fig. 4f), a part of the V and S territories, as well as a very minor
part of the GR territory, is red; this is a synonymous mutation of Tyr and may have
occurred independently. In the case of M13 (Fig. 4g), it is red locally at L, G, and GH;
for L, it first appeared on 1/23 in Guangdong, for G on 3/5 in the USA and for GHiip on
3/15 in India and Saudi Arabia. Notably, the strains that appeared in the GHiip territory

are prevalent in Asia and overlap, in the BLSOM, with or are adjacent to the
Asia-prevalent G strains that also have the M13, showing that the position within on the
map reflects similarities in the presence of mutations other than those contributing to the
main clade separation. Since this is a nonsynonymous mutation from Ser to Leu and
continues to increase monotonically over time, it appears to be a functionally beneficial
mutation. This mutation (M13) and M8, which are not among mutations reported by
Mercatelli and Giorgi (2020)15, have increased in frequency mainly since May.
Collectively, the three mutations (M7, 9 and 11) are also among the ten mutations
related to the main clade separation; therefore, nine mutations analyzed so far were
among the ten mutations, and the remaining one (M0 in Table 1) will be discussed in the
Discussion section. Notably, AI can separate the V clade from others without the
15-mers related to M0, and this type of information should be important for identifying
the mutation essential for separation of the respective clades.
Decreasing 15-mers with no increasing pairs. In the histogram in Fig. 4bii, a higher
number of peaks are observed on the decreasing side (specified by light blue) than on
the increasing side (specified by dark blue), showing that many decreasing 15-mers
were present. BLASTn analysis showed that these 15-mers were derived primarily from
the beginning part of the 5' UTR or the end part of the 3' UTR. Many strains isolated in
the early epidemic stage have been sequenced to near the start and end of the genome,
but with the rapid pandemic spread, a large number of genomes for which the sequences
in UTRs are undetermined have accumulated in the GISAID, and this had resulted in a
time-series decrease for both end sequences. This decrease was due to artificial
manipulation, and there was no relationship between heatmap patterns and clade
territories (data not shown).
However, there was a peculiar group of 15-mers in the S gene, which showed a
time-series decrease, but there was no pair showing an increase. In the heatmap, there
was a characteristic blue pattern but not a red one (Fig. 4h); the small blue regions were
scattered among multiple clade territories, showing that the genomes lacking the
15-mers of interest were scattered there. Since there was no paired red pattern in the
heatmap and no pair increasing in the time-series analysis, the 15-mers decreasing in
Fig. 4h may not be due to mutation. When the sequences located in the small blue areas
were investigated, two consecutive bases in the S gene were registered as unknown
bases (NN); CCUU (24980-24983) was registered as CNNU: N1 in Table1. When the
total number of Ns in the genomes with the CNNU was examined, there was no
tendency for the number to be higher than in other genomes. Therefore, this genomic

site is considered to be difficult to sequence or inaccurate for sequencing; the CNNU
sequence was observed in genomes of five different clades. Even in RNA viral genomes,
modifications such as methylation are known to occur and their functions are drawing
attention20, and some modifications may inhibit the proper progression of reverse
transcriptase, resulting in sequencing difficulty. If the CNNU in the S gene is caused by
RNA modification, the BLSOM will become a method for searching for such special
genomic sites.
Discussion
The analyses shown in Figs. 3 and 4 identified nine mutations, which were among the
ten known mutations assigned by the phylogenetic clustering method based on sequence
alignment. To explore the remaining one (denoted as M0 in Table 1), we analyzed
time-series changes of fifteen 15-mers harboring the M0 mutation and found that their
population frequency was 0.15 in February but only 0.09 in March and did not increase
thereafter (data not shown). Because our analysis was based on 15-mers whose
frequency increased/decreased to at least 0.1 in the March/June population, the M0
mutation was excluded from the analysis. To check this explanation, the
increase/decrease level was reduced to 0.05, and the 2087 types of 15-mers obtained
were used for additional BLSOM analysis (Supplementary Fig. S4). The reverse
patterns of the red/blue heatmap and the time-series change were just as expected (data
not shown), proving that the present AI method produce the result totally consistent
with that of the phylogenetic clustering method. Notably, during AI assignment, the V
clade separation was achieved even without the M0-related 15-mers, and this type of
information should clarify the importance of individual mutations that contribute to
each clade separation. The BLSOM of 2087 types of 15-mers with an increase/decrease
of at least 0.05 should assign the mutations related to much more detailed subgroupings
in each clade. Since the BLSOM has a powerful visualization ability, it can also provide
information concerning genomic sites that are difficult to sequence (e.g., N1 in Table 1
and Fig. 4h) for various reasons, including possible RNA modifications.
Even during preparation of the present manuscript, many genome sequences of
SARS-CoV-2 accumulated in the GISAID database. This appears to be a research
difficulty but should provide a unique advantage. For the fast-evolving RNA virus, the
near-future prediction and verification cycle can be realized, although the elementary
process of molecular evolution is based on random mutation. This is because the
time-series directional changes have been observed on a monthly basis most likely due
to the viral adaptation for efficient growth in human cells. Near-future prediction and

verification should be the most direct ways to test the reliability of the obtained results,
models and ideas, providing a new paradigm for molecular evolutionary studies. Taking
this view into consideration, we will proceed with the discussion.
In the present 15-mer analysis, we focused on the March/June population for the
middle/final period and obtained 587 types of 15-mers that increased/decreased in
population frequency by at least 0.1. When strains isolated later this year become
available, our successive strategy will be to search for new 15-mers that
increased/decreased their frequency by at least 0.1 (or 0.05) compared with that in
December and construct a BLSOM of 15-mers including these newly obtained ones. A
trial analysis of 3700 recently downloaded genomes isolated in August revealed only
one new mutation that increased in frequency to 0.1 in the August population. This
mutation had a frequency of 0.09 in June that increased to 0.12 in August; therefore, the
corresponding 15-mers were included in the BLSOM presented in Supplementary Fig.
S4. In the corresponding heatmap, red/blue inversion was observed within the GR
territory, showing that it was an internal branch of GR. The mutation was an amino acid
substitution: I120F in the gene encoding nsp2.
The phylogenetic method based on sequence alignment is a well-established and
irreplaceable method for molecular evolutionary studies. The presently developed
sequence alignment-free method is suitable for analyzing a massive amount of sequence
data and can analyze over five million sequences simultaneously8; notably, this method
is highly robust against sequencing errors, and therefore, no special pretreatment is
required. Furthermore, the BLSOM is unsupervised AI that can be used without special
models or presumptions, and has powerful visualization capabilities that enable efficient
knowledge discovery from big data. Evolutionary studies have entered the era of big
data, and the present method can complement phylogenetic methods based on sequence
alignment, especially for a massive number of sequences.
Methods
Genome sequences. Genome sequences of human SARS-CoV-2 were downloaded
from the GISAI database
(https://www.gisaid.org/epiflu-applications/next-hcov-19-app/)3; sequences belonging to
the complete genome, high-coverage and human categories were downloaded on July
20, 2020. We used all SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (40,450) after removing their
polyA-tails. Although a significant number of viral sequences contained many Ns
(undetermined nucleotides), we did not conduct any special preprocessing because in
big data analyses, such as word-count analyses, the effects of erroneous data appear to

sequences isolated in August are additionally analyzed. The word-count program can be

BLSOM. The SOM developed by Kohonen et al. (1966)21 is an unsupervised neural
network algorithm that implements characteristic nonlinear projection from the
high-dimensional space of input data onto a two-dimensional array of weight vectors.
We previously modified the conventional SOM for genome informatics to make the
learning process and resulting map independent of data-input order and established a
BLSOM4. The BLSOM for oligonucleotide composition was constructed as described
previously5; initial vectorial data for the BLSOM were defined as the first and second
components from PCA (principal component analysis). Because PCA can detect basic
properties of genomic sequences, such as G+C%, global patterns of oligonucleotide
BLSOMs, in which various learning parameters and the number of sequences per node
are changed, resembled each other5,7,16. However, PCA requires a very long calculation
time for k-mers of a large number of sequences (approximately 40,000 sequences in this
case) when k>6. During machine learning, distance calculation is performed for
sequence data and nodes (e.g., 1/50 of the number of sequences), and the calculation
time is dramatically reduced. In other words, for 7-mer or longer oligonucleotides, the
PCA process used only to determine the initial state requires a much longer computation
time than machine learning, making efficient high-dimensional analysis difficult. To
solve this problem of 7-mers in PCA, 1/100 of the sequences were randomly selected,
and the PCA result obtained for these sequences was used to set the initial state.
BLSOM programs were obtained from k_wada@nagahama-i-bio.ac.jp and
