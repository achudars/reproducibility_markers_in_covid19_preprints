Summary

24

Since the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there have been intense structural studies

25

on purified recombinant viral components and inactivated viruses. However, investigation of

26

the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the native cellular context is scarce, and there is a lack of

27

comprehensive knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 replicative cycle. Understanding the genome

28

replication, assembly and egress of SARS-CoV-2, a multistage process that involves different

29

cellular compartments and the activity of many viral and cellular proteins, is critically

30

important as it bears the means of medical intervention to stop infection. Here, we

31

investigated SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells under the near-native frozen-hydrated

32

condition using a unique correlative multi-modal, multi-scale cryo-imaging approach

33

combining soft X-ray cryo-tomography and serial cryoFIB/SEM volume imaging of the

34

entire SARS-CoV-2 infected cell with cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) of cellular

35

lamellae and cell periphery, as well as structure determination of viral components by

36

subtomogram averaging. Our results reveal at the whole cell level profound cytopathic effects

37

of SARS-CoV-2 infection, exemplified by a large amount of heterogeneous vesicles in the

38

cytoplasm for RNA synthesis and virus assembly, formation of membrane tunnels through

39

which viruses exit, and drastic cytoplasm invasion into nucleus. Furthermore, cryoET of cell

40

lamellae reveals how viral RNAs are transported from double-membrane vesicles where they

41

are synthesized to viral assembly sites; how viral spikes and RNPs assist in virus assembly

42

and budding; and how fully assembled virus particles exit the cell, thus stablishing a model of

43

SARS-CoV-2 genome replication, virus assembly and egress pathways.

Introduction

50

Since December 2019, the world has been in the middle of what has been dubbed the

51

“greatest pandemic of the century”. The etiological agent was named Severe Acute

52

Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease caused by it

53

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Coronaviruses are small enveloped viruses with

54

positive non-segmented RNA genome. Among RNA viruses, Coronaviruses bear one of the

55

largest genomes and its replication in the cell is complex involving frameshift slipping and

56

replicase jumps with abundant RNA duplexes being generated. Coronaviruses, like most

57

RNA viruses, induce the development of a range of membrane compartments that seclude

58

and protect the viral components contributing to increased replication efficiency and innate

59

immune recognition escape (de Wilde et al., 2013; Ertel et al., 2017; Paul et al., 2013; Snijder

60

et al., 2020; Wolff et al., 2020b; Zhou et al., 2017).

61
62

All Coronavirus structural proteins arise from the translation of positive subgenomic RNA,

63

which in turn are generated by replicase jumps when the negative strand copy of the viral

64

genome is replicated. The S protein makes the viral spike, responsible for cellular attachment,

65

entry, and fusion. It adopts two main conformations: prefusion, composed of trimers of S1

66

and S2, and postfusion, a non-active conformation composed solely of S2 (Cai et al., 2020;

67

Fan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2020; Lan et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Walls et al.,

68

2020; Wang et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020). The N protein is responsible for encapsidating and

69

protecting the genomic viral RNA, forming ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes that reside in

70

the internal space of the viral particle. The E protein is the smallest of the structural proteins

71

and is thought to act as an ion channel (Surya et al., 2018). The M protein is the most

72

abundant protein in SARS-CoV-2 and is a transmembrane protein that lines the internal

73

surface of the virus lipid membrane (Neuman et al., 2011).

74
75

The coronavirus cycle starts with S interaction with ACE2 in the host cell surface (Hoffmann

76

et al., 2020; Lan et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Song et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020; Yan et

77

al., 2020). This interaction can either be followed by S2’ cleavage at the cell surface by

78

TMPRSS2, or trigger the endocytosis of the viral particle, when TMPRSS2 is not present

79

(Hoffmann et al., 2020). Upon a second still not completely characterized trigger, which may

80

be the S2’ site cleavage (by TMPRSS2 or endosomal proteases) and/or endosomal

81

acidification, the spike changes conformation and inserts its fusogenic peptide into the host

82

membrane to fuse it with the viral envelope, after which the spike finally adopts the

83

postfusion conformation (Belouzard et al., 2009; Cai et al., 2020; Fan et al., 2020; Simmons

84

et al., 2004). The viral contents are then released into the cytoplasm, and the precursor

85

polyproteins Pp1a and Pp1ab are synthetized. Non-structural proteins 3, 4 and 6, which are

86

part of Pp1a/Pp1ab, induce the formation of secluded, often interconnected, membranous

87

compartments known as DMVs (Double Membrane Vesicles) (Doyle et al., 2018;

88

Hagemeijer et al., 2014; Oudshoorn et al., 2017). The DMVs compartmentalize the

89

Replication Transcription Complexes (RTCs) and are the sole compartments where viral

90

genome replication takes place (Snijder et al., 2020), both for the synthesis of the negative

91

strand viral RNA and for the synthesis of the positive strand subgenomic mRNAs and viral

92

genome RNA copies. Initially, it was thought that these compartments were sealed and had

93

no connection to the cytoplasm, raising the mystery of how the mRNAs could reach the

94

cytoplasm to be translated by the cellular ribosomes. Recently, however, a molecular pore

95

has been described in MHV and SARS-CoV-2 that can serve as export portal for the mRNA

96

and positive strand viral genome copies (Wolff et al., 2020a). The assembly of the viral

97

particle is thought to take place at modified cellular membranes derived from the ER, Golgi

98

and ERGIC (endoplasmic-reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment), and viral release

99

through exocytosis, based on studies of other coronaviruses (Goldsmith et al., 2004; Knoops

100

et al., 2008; Ogando et al., 2020; Stertz et al., 2007). Although, there have been intense

101

structural studies on recombinant viral components and purified inactivated viruses

102

(Hoffmann et al., 2020; Ke et al., 2020; Lan et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Song et al., 2018;

103

Turoňová et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020), investigation of

104

the SARS-CoV-2 replication process in the native cellular context is scarce, and viral

105

assembly and egress are still not well understood at the molecular level.

106
107

In this study we investigated SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero cells under near-native

108

conditions exploiting a unique correlative multi-modal multi-scale cryo-imaging approach by

109

combining soft X-ray cryo-tomography and serial cryoFIB/SEM volume imaging of the

110

entire SARS-CoV-2 infected cell with cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) of cell lamellae

111

and cell periphery, as well as structure determination of viral components through

112

subtomogram averaging. This approach empowers a holistic view of SARS-CoV-2 infection,

113

from the whole cell to individual molecules, revealing novel pathways of SARS-CoV-2

114

assembly and egress and cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

SARS-CoV-2 replication induces profound cytopathic effects in host cells

119

To image and investigate SARS-CoV-2 replication in near-native cell context, we infected

120

Vero cells grown on indexed EM grids with SARS-CoV-2 at 0, 0.1 and 0.5 multiplicity of

121

infection (MOI). At 24 hours post infection (hpi), the cells were fixed with 4%

122

paraformaldehyde and plunge frozen in liquid ethane. As illustrated in the workflow (Figure

123

S1), cryoEM grids containing SARS-CoV-2 infected cells were first screened in a Titan

124

Krios to identify each individual infected cell (39.2 % for MOI of 0.1 and 45.4% for MOI

125

0.5) where cryoET tilt series were collected at the cell periphery. The grids were then

126

transferred to a FIB/SEM dualbeam instrument and the same infected cells were subjected to

127

either serial cryoFIB/SEM volume imaging (Zhu et al., 2021) or cryoFIB milling of cellular

128

lamellae where additional cryoET tilt series were collected (Sutton et al., 2020).

129

Alternatively, we imaged infected cells on cryoEM grids by soft X-ray cryo-tomography

130

(Harkiolaki et al., 2018; Kounatidis et al., 2020). It's worth mentioning that serial

131

cryoFIB/SEM volume imaging is emerging as a new cryo-volume imaging technique for the

132

study of large volumes of near-native, fully hydrated frozen cells and tissues at voxel sizes of

133

10 nm and below, adding to the capability of soft X-ray cryo-tomography. These imaging

134

modalities provide structural information at different length scales and are highly

135

complementary. Such a unique approach enabled the comprehensive investigation of the

136

SARS-CoV-2 replication and cytopathology effects in a multi-modal, multi-scale and

137

correlative manner.

138
139

Compared to uninfected cells (Figure S2, Movie 1), serial cryoFIB/SEM images of SARS-

140

CoV-2 infected cells display an extensive array of cytopathological alterations throughout the

141

entire cell, as illustrated in Figure 1 and Movies 2-5. At the cell surface, there were many

142

virus-containing membrane tunnels extending deep into the cell (Figure 1A, “T”, Movie 2),

143

in addition to electron lucent membrane vesicles (Figure 1A, “V”). Virus particles were also

144

found within intracellular vesicles not connected to cell membrane (Figure 1A, red arrow).

145

Deep into the cell, much of the cytoplasm is occupied with abundant membrane

146

compartments of different morphologies, including numerous vesicles (“V”) (Movie 4), the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.05.370239; this version posted November 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this

147

complex membrane compartment (pink arrow), the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the

148

nucleus (“Nuc”) (Figure 1B, Movie 2 and 3). Most of these vesicles are the so-called “double

149

membrane vesicles” (DMVs) where viral genome replication takes place (Snijder et al.,

150

2020). Interestingly, we observed a different type of electron lucent vesicles which appears

151

lined up with a string of very small vesicles (Figure 1B, “V*”), the function of which is

152

revealed by cryoET of cell lamella discussed in sections below. At the mid-cell where the

153

nucleus is present, cryoFIB/SEM images clearly display nuclear pores in frozen-hydrated

154

cells (Figure 1C, Figure S2A&C, blue arrows). Mitochondria are frequently disrupted in the

155

infected cells (Figure 1C, yellow arrow, Movie 2) compared to the uninfected cells (Figure

156

S2, Movie 1). In addition, cryoFIB/SEM reveals electron-dense complex membrane

157

compartments often seen in infected cells (Figure 1B, pink arrows). The more striking

158

feature, observed in 2 of 3 infected cells imaged, is the cytopathic damage to the nucleus

159

compared to the control cells, where nearly a half of the nucleus has been taken up by the

160

invaginated cytoplasm (Figure 1D, Movie 5). We noticed that in a recent study, such

161

cytoplasm invagination was also seen in one of the conventional EM images of stained

162

plastic sections of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, although no description was given (Lamers et

163

al., 2020).

164
165

Independently, we investigated cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection using soft X-ray

166

cryo-tomography. Consistent with the cryoFIB/SEM volume imaging results, the overview

167

images of soft X-ray display profound changes in mitochondria morphology, as they appear

168

fragmented in the SARS-CoV-2 infected cell (Figure S3B&D, F), also shown in cryoET

169

(Figure S4), compared to the extended and networked mitochondria in the uninfected cell

170

(Figure S3A&C). Consistent with this, SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to profound

171

downregulation of transcriptional pathways related to mitochondrial function in human

172

induced pluripotent stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes (Sharma et al., 2020), and cardiac

173

complications are more common in COVID-19 patients (Fried et al., 2020). Virus particles

174

on the cell surface are clearly distinguishable in soft X-ray cryo-tomogram (Figure S3E,

175

black arrow). Also clearly observed are extensive vesiculation (Figure S3F) and a partial

176

nucleus invagination in the infected cell (Figure 3G).

177
178

Altogether, soft X-ray cryo-tomography and serial cryoFIB/SEM volume imaging provide a

179

comprehensive overview of cytopathic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in native cells,

180

including membrane tunnels at the cell surface, virus-containing vesicles, intracellular

181

complex membrane compartments, and numerous heterogeneous vesicles, invagination of

182

nuclear membrane and damaged mitochondria, all of which can be correlated with in-depth in

183

cellulo cryoET analysis (sections below).

184
185

SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis and transport

186

The first step in SARS-CoV-2 production is viral genome replication. Coronaviruses have

187

evolved a sophisticated RNA replication strategy for the generation of the subgenomic

188

RNAs, which relies heavily on double stranded RNA intermediaries, a potent activator of

189

RIG-I and MDA-5 (Andrejeva et al., 2004; Hornung et al., 2006; Neufeldt et al., 2016). Thus,

190

cellular compartmentalization of RNA transcripts serves as an innate immune evasion

191

strategy. DMVs are induced during the replication of a variety of RNA viruses (de Wilde et

192

al., 2013; Ertel et al., 2017; Paul et al., 2013; Wolff et al., 2020b; Zhou et al., 2017), and were

193

identified as the sole compartment where viral RNA transcription occurs for coronaviruses

194

(Snijder et al., 2020). Indeed, cryoET of cell lamella revealed that abundant intracellular

195

vesicles observed in the 3D volume of infected cell (Figure 1D, Movie 3 and 4) are clearly

196

DMVs containing filamentous structures that likely correspond to viral RNA transcripts as

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.05.370239; this version posted November 5, 2020. The copyright holder for this

197

previously suggested (Reggiori et al., 2010; Snijder et al., 2020) (Figure 2A-C, Movie 6).

198

There are also a substantial amount of so-called vesicle packets (VPs) (Figure 2B) (Ogando

199

et al., 2020), apparently resulting from the fusion of the outer membranes of DMVs. Since

200

the sample is 24 hours post infection, this is consistent with a previous observation that the

201

number of VPs increases with the time of infection (Snijder et al., 2020). Until very recently,

202

DMVs were thought to be completely enclosed, which raised the question of how the viral

203

mRNAs could gain access to the cytoplasm to be translated. We observed several double-

204

membrane-spanning pore complexes in DMVs (Figure 2C-F, yellow arrow), resembling the

205

RNA transport portal seen in DMVs of murine hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) infected cells in

206

a recent study (Wolff et al., 2020a). However, the portal appears rare in DMVs of SARS-

207

CoV-2 (total 9 portals from 24 DMVs) compared to those of MHV (8 portals per DMV),

208

signifying the difference between coronaviruses. We also observed vaultosomes near the

209

DMV outer membranes (Figure 2F, black arrow). It is still unclear what is the physiological

210

role of vaults is, but they have been associated with RNA nucleocytoplasmic transport, innate

211

immunity, and cellular stress response (Berger et al., 2009; Woodward et al., 2015), which

212

are likely to be activated by infection.

213
214

SARS-CoV-2 assembly and budding

215

The translation of the subgenomic vRNAs gives rise, amongst others, to the structural

216

proteins N, M, E and S, which are required for assembly. M, E and S are membrane-

217

associated proteins and are localized to the ER, Golgi and the ERGIC (Reggiori et al., 2010;

218

Stertz et al., 2007). The N protein associates with the genomic vRNA and M protein, which

219

presumably drives vRNA packaging and genome encapsidation (Lu et al., 2020; Vennema et

220

al., 1996). The main assembly and budding site of other coronaviruses has been previously

221

described at the ERGIC by conventional EM of stained, plastic embedded, and sectioned

222

samples (de Wilde et al., 2013; Knoops et al., 2008; Reggiori et al., 2010; Stertz et al., 2007).

223

In serial cryoFIB/SEM images of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, we clearly observed vesicles

224

containing virus particles (Figure 3A, black arrows), along with a string of small dense

225

vesicles lining along the vesicle membrane in the close proximity to the DMVs (Figure 3B,

226

pink arrow). High-resolution cryoET of cell lamella from a similar cellular region allowed us

227

to unambiguously identify that these are in fact SARS-CoV-2 assembly and budding sites

228

(Figure 3C-E). CryoET further revealed that the string of small dense vesicles are SARS-

229

CoV-2 spike containing trans-Golgi transport vesicles, supplying newly synthesized spikes to

230

the assembly sites via fusion with the SMVs (Figure 3C-E pink arrows, Movie 7). Indeed,

231

spikes are observed on SMV membranes clustered at the assembly sites, in addition to being

232

sparsely distributed (Figure 2D, Figure 3C-E, red arrows, Movie 7). Interestingly, several

233

SARS-CoV-2 assembly intermediates were observed within a single tomogram from a cell

234

lamella (Figure 3C-E, blue arrows, Movie 7), along with fully assembled virus particles

235

released into SMVs (Figure 3C-E, black arrows, Movie 7), thus allows capturing the active

236

assembly and budding process of SARS-CoV-2. It is conceivable that upon fusion of

237

transport vesicles with the SMV, spikes are readily diffused onto the SMV membrane, then

238

clustering when interacting with N-associated vRNA, possibly via M protein (Lu et al., 2020;

239

Neuman et al., 2011), which initiates the budding process that finally releases the viral

240

particle into the SMV. Consistent with this, spike clusters are observed exclusively associated

241

with the agglutination/gathering of electron dense material, which presumably represents

242

viral genome. Noticeably, the virus assembly site is frequently present in the vicinity of RNA

243

portals in DMVs (Figure 2C-E, yellow arrows), potentially facilitating the assembly process.

244

The N-associated vRNA further matures as distinct RNPs recognizable in the fully assembled

245

virus particles (Movie 7).

247

Most virus particles are found in ERGIC SMVs, some contain a single virion, while others

248

encompass multiple virions (Figure 3E-F). CryoET and subtomogram averaging of 450

249

spikes from these particles yielded a density map at 11 Å resolution (at 0.143 FSC cut-off) by

250

emClarity (Himes and Zhang, 2018) (Figure 3F-G, Figure S5). The averaged density map

251

resolves the overall spike structure, which overlaps very well with prefusion spike atomic

252

models (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Lan et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020; Wang

253

et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020) . Virus particles were also observed in electron-dense complex

254

autophagolysosome-like compartments (ALC) (Figure 4), which likely correspond to the

255

complex membrane compartments seen in cryoFIB/SEM (Figure 1B, pink arrows). These

256

virus particles, however, have either no spikes (Figure 4B) or a few postfusion spikes on their

257

surfaces (Figure 4E-F). Viruses protected by single membrane vesicles (SMV) in ALC show

258

prefusion spikes (Figure 4G-H). These could be off-pathway sites of viral assembly (in the

259

case of SMV-protected viruses displaying prefusion spikes), remnants of late endosomes

260

from viral entry or lysosomes for viral degradation (in the case of viruses displaying

261

postfusion spikes or no spike). The fact that the spike proteins are in the postfusion state

262

suggests that proteolytic processing has taken place in these compartments resulting in S1

263

shedding. Therefore, we suggest that assembly at the ERGIC SMVs is the only pathway

264

which will lead to infectious viral progeny.

265
266

SARS-CoV-2 egress with two distinct pathways

267

There has not been much detailed studies on how SARS-CoV-2 viruses are released from

268

cell. We investigated SARS-CoV-2 egress using both serial cryoFIB/SEM volume imaging

269

and cryoET. CryoFIB/SEM images clearly reveal virus exiting tunnels in 3D at the cell

270

periphery connecting to cell membrane (Figure 5A-B, Movie 2). This likely resulted from the

271

fusion of very large multi-virus containing vesicles with cell membrane, i.e. egress through

exocytosis. Consistent with cryoFIB/SEM analysis, we also observed virus exiting tunnels in

273

cryo-tomograms (Figure 5C). The fact that these compartments often contained many viral

274

particles suggests that this is a snapshot of viral exit, rather than cellular entry.

275
276

However, in addition to exocytosis, we also frequently found plasma membrane

277

discontinuities next to viral particles outside the cell (Figure 5E). There are 116 membrane

278

lesion sites next to virus particles in 74 tomograms, and 44.6% of tomograms show cell

279

membrane lesions in infected cells (Figure 5D-E, Movie 8-9), whereas 18.7 % tomograms

280

from uninfected cells display similar membrane lesions (10 membrane lesion sites from 16

281

tomograms). Close inspection of individual membrane lesions indicats that the underlying

282

cytoskeleton, such as actin filaments, is largely intact, and only the plasma membrane was

283

compromised (Figure 5E inset). The fact that we observed the same membrane lesion, but to

284

a lesser extent in control cells, suggests that SARS-CoV-2 exploits the host cell machinery

285

for its egress. Cellular exit through plasma membrane rupture may be an alternative viral

286

egress pathway of SARS-CoV-2, as this is observed frequently in our data. It is unclear

287

whether the cell can recover from such membrane wounds, or if exit through membrane

288

rupture is a sign of late infection and will eventually lead to cell lysis and death. Severe cases

289

of COVID-19 are characterized by high levels of inflammation markers (Lucas et al., 2020),

290

and viral lysis may be one of the mechanisms triggering this response.

291
292

CryoET subtomogram averaging of 7090 spikes from extracellular virus particles yielded a

293

density map at 8.7 Å resolution (at 0.143 FSC cut-off), which represents the prefusion state

294

(Figure 4F, Figure S5). Spike structures from intracellular and extracellular viruses agree

295

with each other very well (Figure 4G), suggesting that no further structure rearrangement

296

takes place for viral spikes from assembly to egress. While all previous spike structures are

297

either from recombinant proteins or from purified inactivated virus particles (Cai et al., 2020;

2020), the two spike structures presented here are derived directly from infected cells in the

301

cellular context, and thus represent the closest to native condition, providing a strong

302

validation for these in vitro structures.

303
304

Discussion

305

We used a multi-modal, multi-scale and correlative approach to investigate SARS-CoV-2

306

infection process in native cells, from the whole cell to subcellular and to the molecular level.

307

The integration of multi-scale imaging data, achieved through this advanced workflow

308

(Figure S1), has led us to propose a pathway for SARS-CoV-2 replication, in particular virus

309

genome replication, assembly and egress. The replication of SARS-CoV-2 appears spatially

310

well-organized and highly efficient. From genome replication, to protein synthesis and

311

transport, to virus assembly and budding, these processes take place in close-knit cytoplasmic

312

compartments. As illustrated in Figure 6, RNA replication, including vRNA and mRNA,

313

occurs in DMVs, secluding them from innate immune response (step 1). The newly

314

synthesized vRNAs are then transported out of DMVs through the transmembrane portals to

315

ERGIC virus assembly sites proximal to DMVs and portals (step 2a), whereas mRNAs exit

316

through the same portal to cytoplasm and ER/Golgi for protein production (step 2b). The

317

viral spikes, in a trimeric prefusion form produced and matured in ER/Golgi network, are

318

transported to the ERGIC assembly sites via small transport vesicles (step 3). Upon fusion of

319

transport vesicles with ERGIC membranes (or SMVs), viral spikes cluster at the assembly

320

site where vRNA and N protein are present, resulting in a positive membrane curvature and

321

finally bud into the SMV (step 4). Depending on the number of virus particles within SMVs,

322

there might be two distinct egress pathways: the large virus-containing vesicle (LVCV)

323

through tunnels via exocytosis (step 5a), and the single virus-containing vesicle (SVCV)

324

breaking out through cell membrane rupture (step 5b), although it is still unclear what is the

325

mechanism of membrane rupture exploited by the virus.

326
327

The genome replication, assembly and egress of the virus is a multistage process that is

328

critically important as it bears the means of medical intervention to stop infection. There are

329

many aspects of this process await further investigation to dissect the mechanism of SARS-

330

CoV-2 replication, including the roles of other viral proteins, such as M and E, as well as host

331

proteins and machines. Nevertheless, this study provides a first glimpse of the SARS-CoV-2

332

replication cycle under near-native conditions. The methodologies and workflow developed

333

through this study can be broadly applied to studies of infection processes of many other

334

viruses or bacteria, beyond SARS-CoV-2.

Methods

437

Sample preparation

438

Vero Ccl-81 cells (ATCC) were maintained Dulbecco Modified Eagle media supplemented

439

with 5% Fetal Bovine Serum 10 units/mL penicillin (Gibco), 10 µg/mL streptomycin

440

(Gibco), and 2mM l-glutamine. 16,000 cells were seeded on the carbon-side of fibronectin

441

treated G300F1 R2/2 gold EM grids in a 6-well plate well. Infections were performed using

442

passage 3 of SARS-CoV-2 England/02/2020 at MOI of 0.5, 0.1 or 0 (for negative controls).

443

Media was removed from the Vero Ccl-81 cells (ATCC) and replaced with an appropriate

444

amount of virus diluted in 0.5 mL of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (Merck) with 1%

445

FCS, 10 units/mL penicillin (Gibco), 10 µg/mL streptomycin (Gibco), and 2mM l-glutamine.

446

The cells were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes after which a further 1.5 mL of

447

media was added to each well. The plate was then incubated at 37 °C for 24 hours following

448

which supernatants were discarded and cells washed with 2 mL of PBS. The cells were then

449

fixed by addition of 3 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature.

450

After fixation, grids were plunge-frozen on a Leica Grid plunger 2. 1 ul of concentrated 10

451

nm gold fiducials was applied to the gold-side of the EM grid and blotted from the gold-side.

452

The grid was quickly immersed in liquid ethane after blotting. Frozen grids were stored in

453

liquid nitrogen until data collection.

454
455

CryoET data acquisition

456

Tilt series acquisition was carried out at a FEI Titan Krios G2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific)

457

electron microscope operated at 300 kV and equipped with a Gatan BioQuantum energy filter

458

and post-GIF K3 detector (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA).

460

Tilt series were recorded using SerialEM tilt series controller with pixel sizes of 1.63 Å, 2.13

461

Å and 4.58 Å for intact cells and 2.13 Å and 7.58 Å on lamella. Zero-loss imaging was used

462

for all tilt series with a 20 eV slit width. Defocus values ranged from -2 µm to -7 µm, except

463

for lamella at 7.58 Å pixel size where 50 µm defocus was used. A 100 µm objective aperture

464

was inserted. A grouped dose-symmetric scheme was used for all tilt-series; intact cells were

465

collected with a range of +/-60 degrees at 3 degree increments in groups of 3 and total dose

466

of 120-135 e/Å2; lamella with +/-54 degrees at 3 degree increments and groups of 3 with total

467

dose of 120-135 e/Å2 at 4.58 Å and +/-54 degrees at 3 degree increments and groups of 10

468

with total dose of 70-90 e/ Å2 at 7.58 Å. Autofocus and tracking was performed at each tilt

469

with drift measurement taken at tilt reversals with a 10 Å/s target rate. At each tilt, 5 movie

470

frames were recorded using Correlated Double Sampling (CDS) in super-resolution mode

471

and saved in lzw compressed tif format with no gain normalisation. Movies were

472

subsequently gain normalised during motion correction and fourier cropped back to physical

473

pixel size. After each tilt-series a script was run to take a fresh dark reference and reset the

474

defocus offset.

475
476

CryoFIB lamella preparation

477

Milling of SARS-Cov-2 infected cells was carried out using a Scios DualBeam cryoFIB

478

(ThermoFisher Scientific) equipped with a PP3010T transfer system and stage (Quorum

479

Technologies). Grids were sputter coated within the PP3010T transfer chamber maintained at

480

-175 °C. After loading onto the Scios stage at -168 °C, the grids were inspected using the

481

SEM (operated at 5 kV and 13 pA) and cells, identified as infected from TEM, were found.

482

The grid surface was coated using the gas injection system

483

(Trimethyl(methylcyclopentadienyl)platinum(IV), ThermoFisher Scientific) for 3 s, yielding

484

a thickness of ~3 um. Milling was performed using the ion beam operated at 30 kV and

485

currents decreasing from 300 pA to 30 pA. At 30 pA lamella thickness was less than 300 nm.

486

During the final stage of milling, SEM inspection of the lamellae was conducted at 2 kV and

487

13 pA.

488
489

Serial cryoFIB/SEM volume imaging

490

Samples were imaged on a Zeis Crossbeam 550XL fitted with a Quorum transfer station and

491

cryo-stage. They were mounted on a Quorum-compatible custom sample holder and coated

492

with platinum for 60 sec at 10 mA on the Quorum transfer stage, prior to loading on the cryo-

493

stage. Stage temperature was set at -165°C, while the anticontaminator was held at -185°C.

494

Samples were imaged at 45° tilt after being coated again with Pt for 2x 30sec using the FIB-

495

SEM’s internal GIS system, with the Pt reservoir held at 25°C. Initial trapezoid trenches were

496

milled at 30kV 7nA over 15 μm to reach a final depth of 10 μm, with a polish step over a

497

rectangular box with a depth of 10 μm performed at 30kV 1.5 nA. Serial Sectioning and

498

Imaging acquisition was performed as follows: FIB milling was set up using the 30kV 700

499

pA probe, a z-slice step of 20 nm and a depth of 10 μm over the entire milling box; SEM

500

imaging was performed at a pixel depth of 3024x2304 pixels, which resulted in a pixel size of

501

6.5 nm, with the beam set at 2kV 35pA, dwell time 100 nsec and scan speed 1, averaging the

502

signal over 100 line scans as a noise-reduction strategy.

503
504

CryoET image processing

505

The frames in each tilt angle in a tilt series were processed to correct drift using MotionCor2

506

(Zheng et al., 2017). For the intact cells dataset, all tilt series were aligned using the default

507

parameters in IMOD version 4.10.22 with the eTomo interface, using gold-fiducial markers

508

(Kremer et al., 1996). For lamella dataset, The tilt series were aligned in the framework of

509

Appion-Protomo fiducial-less tilt-series alignment suite (Noble and Stagg, 2015). After tilt

510

series alignment, the tilt-series stacks together with the files describing the projection

511

transformation and fitted tilt angles were transferred to emClarity for the subsequent sub-

512

tomogram averaging analysis (Himes and Zhang, 2018).

513
514

Subtomogram averaging

515

All sub-tomogram averaging analysis steps were performed using emClarity, mostly

516

following previously published protocols described workflow (Himes and Zhang, 2018). The

517

CTF estimation for each tilt was performed by using emClarity version 1.4.3 , and the

518

subvolumes were selected by using automatic template matching function within emClarity

519

using reference derived from EMDB-21452 (Walls et al., 2020) that was low-pass filtered to

520

30-Å resolution in emClarity. The template matching results were cleaned manually by

521

comparison of the binned tomograms overlaid with the emClarity-generated IMOD model

522

showing the x,y,z coordinates of each cross-correlation peak detected. After manually

523

template cleaning, A total of 450 subvolumes from the lamella dataset and a total of 7090

524

subvolumes from the extracellular viruses dataset were retained, deriving from 3 tilt-series

525

and 50 tilt-series respectively, for the following averaging and alignment steps in emClarity.

526

For the extracellular viruses dataset, the 3D iterative averaging and alignment procedures

527

were carried out gradually with binning of 4x, 3x, 2x , each with 2-3 iterations with

528

increasingly restrictive search angles and translational shifts. 3-fold symmetry was applied

529

during all the steps. Final converged average map was generated using bin2 tomograms with

530

pixel size of 3.26 Å/pixel and a box size of 123×123×123 voxels. Resolution indicated by

531

0.143 FSC cut-off was 8.7 Å. The same process was carried out for lamella dataset, except

532

for the final average map was generated with pixel size of 4.26 Å/pixel

533

and a box size of 90×90×90 voxels and a final resolution at 11 Å (Gold standard FSC at

534

0.143 cut-off).

539

Windows computer with 32GB RAM and Wacom Cintiq Pro display tablet with pen.

Transport vesicles, Viral membrane, Nuclear membrane, Double membrane vesicles (DMV),

545

and single membrane vesicles (SMV) were segmented using Convolutional Neural Networks

546

based tomogram annotation in the EMAN2.2 software package (Chen et al., 2017). Viral

547

spikes were mapped back to their original particles position using emClarity tomoCPR

548

function. UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) was used to visualize the segmentations and

549

subtomogram average structures in 3D.

Soft X-ray Cryo-tomography

552

Data were collected in areas of interest on vitrified samples on 3mm TEM grids according to

553

established protocols (Kounatidis et al., 2020). Grids were loaded on the X-ray microscope at

554

B24 and were first mapped using visible light with a 20X objective. The resulting coordinate-

555

map was used to locate areas of interest where 2D X-ray mosaics were collected (X-ray light

556

used was at 500eV) and used to identify areas of interest within. Tilt series of 100-120 º were

557

collected for each field of view area of interest at 0.2 or 0.5º steps with constant exposure of

558

0.5 sec keeping average pixel intensity to between 5-30k counts. All tilt series were

Quantification and statistical analyses

563

Number of pores in DMV and plasma membrane discontinuities were determined after visual

564

inspection and visual counting by two independent investigators. The investigators were not

565

blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.

viral egress. Inset, close-up views of membrane rupture sites. (F) Subtomogram average of
spikes on released viruses at 9 Å resolution fitted with an atomic model of spike trimer (PDB
6ZB5) (Toelzer et al., 2020), viewed from side and top. (G) Comparison of spike structures from
intracellular assembled viruses (blue) and extracellular released viruses (transparent grey),
shown in side and top views. Scale bar is 300 nm in A and B, and 100 nm in C, D and E.

Figure 6 | Proposed model of SARS-CoV-2 replication. (1) Viral genome replication occurs
inside the DMVs, generating the negative strand viral RNA (red), positive vRNA genomic copy
and subgenomic mRNAs (blue). (2) Positive RNAs are exported to cytoplasm through the DMV
pores. Subgenomic mRNAs are translated (2b). Structural proteins M, E and S associate with
ER, Golgi and ERGIC membranes. Genomic vRNA becomes complexed with newly-synthetized
N (2a). (3) S, E and M are transported in dense vesicles which are fuse with the ERGIC SMVs. (4)
Productive viral assembly happens in the SMV clustering the viral spikes and encapsidating the
genome in RNPs. Viruses bud to the internal space of the SMV. (5) Egress occurs through
tunnels via exocytosis-like release (5a) or through membrane rupture (5b). The non-productive
autophagolysosome-like compartment (ALC) is depicted in green. DMV, double membraned
vesicle; SMV, single membrane vesicle; ALC, autophagolysosome-like compartment; LVCV, large
virus-containing vesicle; SVCV, Single virus-containing vesicle.
