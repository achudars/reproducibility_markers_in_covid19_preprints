Abstract
The human serine protease TMPRSS2 gene is involved in the priming of the novel
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) proteins being one of
the possible targets for COVID-19 therapy. TMPRSS2 gene is possibly co-expressed
with SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor genes ACE2 and BSG, but only TMPRSS2
demonstrates tissue-specific expression in alveolar cells according to single cell RNA
sequencing data. Our analysis of the structural variability of the TMPRSS2 gene based
on genome-wide data of 76 human populations demonstrates that functionally
significant missense mutation in exon 6/7 in TMPRSS2 gene, was found in many human
populations in relatively high frequency, featuring region-specific distribution patterns.
The frequency of the missense mutation encoded by the rs12329760, which previously
was found to be associated with prostate cancer, is ranged between 10% and 63% being
significantly higher in populations of Asian origin compared to European populations.
In addition to SNPs, two copy numbers variants (CNV) were detected in the TMPRSS2
gene. Number of microRNAs have been predicted to regulate TMPRSS2 and BSG
expression levels, but none of them is enriched in lung or respiratory tract cells. Several
well studied drugs can downregulate the expression of TMPRSS2 in human cells,
including Acetaminophen (Paracetamol) and Curcumin. Thus TMPRSS2 interaction
with the SARS-CoV-2, its structural variability, gene-gene interactions, and expression
regulation profiles, and pharmacogenomics properties characterize this gene as a
potential target for COVID-19 therapy.

Introduction

1

Novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused a
pandemic of coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) and lead to a global public health crisis.
Infection of the human cells with viral particles occurs through the binding of S viral
proteins to the receptors of the host cell and their subsequent priming with proteases.
ACE2 is considered the classic receptor for SARS-CoV-2, but there is evidence that it
can also use the BSG receptor (CD147) [33]. The priming of viral proteins is carried out
by the TMPRSS2 protease. No specific therapy has yet been developed for SARS-CoV-2.
But it was found that blockers of all three proteins can prevent cell infection [15].
In addition to protein blocking, there are other mechanisms that can alter the
expression level or affinity of the interaction of viral particles with specific proteins.
Possible ways of expression differentiation include alteration of protein structure due to
genetic variants (SNV, INDEL), copy number variation (CNV), variants affecting
regulatory regions (eQTL), and epigenetic regulation (methylation, miRNA).
TMPRSS2 gene in humans encodes a transmembrane protein that belongs to the
serine protease family. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different
isoforms have been found for this gene. TMPRSS2 protein involved in prostate
carcinogenesis via overexpression of ETS transcription factors, such as ERG and ETV1,
through gene fusion. TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion, present in 40% - 80% of prostate
cancers in humans, is one of the molecular subtypes that has been associated with
predominantly poor prognosis [25, 28].
TMPRSS2 protease proteolytically cleaves and activates glycoproteins of many
viruses including spike proteins of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human
coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC); the fusion glycoproteins of Sendai virus (SeV), human
metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, 4a and 4b viruses
(HPIV) [1, 4, 13–15, 29, 30]. It has been shown that both the SARS coronavirus of 2003
severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in Asia (SARS-CoV) and the SARS-CoV-2
are activated by TMPRSS2 and can thus be inhibited by TMPRSS2 inhibitors [15]. In
this work, we report the data on genetic variability of TMPRSS2 gene in 76 human
populations of North Eurasia in comparison with worldwide populations; analyze the
data on expression and its regulation of TMPRSS2 gene, its interaction with
SARS-CoV-2 receptors, and its pharmacogenetic properties.

Allele frequency for worldwide populations were downloaded from GnomAD database
containing information on the frequencies of genomic variants from more than 120
thousand exomes and 15 thousand of whole genomes [18]. These data were used to
search SNVs and INDELs in TMPRSS2 gene. Data on copy number variation were
obtained from CNV Control Database [21].
Data on allele frequencies in 76 populations of North Eurasia were extracted from
the unpublished own dataset of population genomics data obtained by genotyping using
Illumina Infinium genome-wide microarrays. In brief, 1836 samples from 76 human
populations were genotyped for 1748250 SNVs and INDELs using Infinium
Multi-Ethnic Global-8 Kit. Populations represent various geographic regions of North
Eurasia (Eastern Europe, Caucasus, Central Asia, Siberia, North-East Asia) and belong
to various linguistic families (Indo-European, Altaic, Uralic, North Caucasian,
Chukotko-Kamchatkan, Sino-Tibetan., Yeniseian). DNA samples were collected under
informed consent and deposited to DNA bank of the Research Institute for Medical

the Institute of Biochemistry and Genetics, Ufa Federal Research Centre of the Russian
Academy of Sciences. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the
Research Institute for Medical Genetics, Tomsk National Medical Research Center.
Data on 4 missense mutations in TMPRSS2 gene were extracted from the dataset. CNV
search was performed using Markov model algorithm for high-resolution copy number
variation detection in whole-genome SNP implemented in PennCNV tool [34].
To determine possible functional impact of detected SNVs, the Polymorphism
Phenotyping v2 (Poly-Phen-2) tool was used [2]. Poly-Phen estimates the impact of the
mutation on the stability and function of the protein using the structural and
evolutionary analyses of the amino acid substitution. The tool evaluates the probability
of the mutation to be probably damaging, possibly damaging, benign or of unknown
significance using quantitative prediction with a score.

Bioinformatics analysis of gene expression, miRNA intercaction
and pharmacogenomics
Analysis of protein – protein interactions of SARS-CoV-2 interacting proteins was
carried out using the GeneMANIA and STRING web resources [32, 38]. Single cell RNA
sequencing data were downloaded from the PanglaoDB database which contains more
than 1300 single cell sequencing samples [12]. Lung cells single cell RNA-seq data were
obtained from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) [22] and processed in R software
environment using the Seurat package [31].
Analysis of the interaction of miRNAs with target proteins was performed using
information from two databases, miRTarBase, which contains information from more
than 8000 referenced sources about experimentally confirmed micro RNA - protein
interactions [16], and miRPathDB database containing experimentally confirmed and
predicted miRNA-protein interactions [19]. Data on the differential expression of
miRNAs in various cell cultures were downloaded from the database of the FANTOM5
project [10]. DRUGBANK database [35] was used to search for the drugs which may
change the level of protein expression.

Protein-protein interaction network of SARS-CoV-2 interacting
genes
Protein-protein interaction networks obtained with two different tools (GeneMANIA
and STRING) (Fig. 1) demonstrates that TMPRSS2 is co-expressing with other
SARS-CoV-2 interacting genes, despite showed contradictory co-expression patterns.
According to GeneMANIA, TMPRSS2 is co-expressed with BSG, while STRING
indicates co-expression between ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Interestingly that BSG shows
the maximum number of protein-protein interactions in both networks.
Basigin, or extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), also known
as cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147), encoded by the BSG gene, is a transmembrane
glycoprotein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and is a determinant for
the Ok blood group system. BSG protein plays an important role in targeting the
monocarboxylate transporters SLC16A1, SLC16A3, SLC16A8, SLC16A11 and
SLC16A12 to the plasma membrane [7, 24, 27]. BSG is involved in spermatogenesis,
embryo implantation, neural network formation and tumor progression. It stimulates
adjacent fibroblasts to produce matrix metalloproteinases (MMPS). BSG seems to be a
receptor for oligomannosidic glycans and according to in vitro experiments can promote

outgrowth of astrocytic processes [7, 24, 27]. BSG is which is involved in tumor
development, plasmodium invasion and virus infection [8, 17, 23, 26, 36, 37]. Previous
data on severe acute respiratory syndrome indicate that BSG plays a functional role in
facilitating SARS-CoV invasion for host cells, and CD147-antagonistic peptide-9 has a
high binding rate to HEK293 cells and an inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV [9]. Based on
the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the function of BSG in invasion for host
cells by SARS-CoV-2 can be assumed. The exact role of BSG in COVID-19 is still
unknown, but recently it was found that CD147 may bind spike protein of
SARS-CoV-2 [33]. The preliminary data on a small sample of COVID-19 patients
demonstrated that Meplazumab, a humanized anti-CD147 antibody, efficiently improved
the recovery of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia with a favorable safety profile [6].

Data on expression profiles of SARS-CoV-2-interacting genes in various tissues
demonstrates that ACE2 has a high level of expression only in testicles (Fig. 2a).
Highest expression of BSG was found in germ cells, endothelium of various localization,
fibroblasts and some other cell types (Fig. 2b). TMPRSS2 showed a high level of
expression in the prostate, intestines, and lungs (Fig. 2c).
In addition, the expression of these proteins was analyzed in a single sample
(SRS2769051) of proximal stromal lung cells (Fig. 3). ACE2 had a low level of
expression in pulmonary alveolar cells and as well as in fibroblasts. BSG is
characterized by the average level of expression in fibroblasts and alveolar cells. Only
TMPRSS2 gene demonstrates tissue-specific expression in alveolar cells.
Given the high specificity of expression of TMPRSS2 in lung, we further studied
genomic and epigenomic properties of the gene that may possibly affect the level of its
expression and the affinity of interaction with viral particles.

According information accumulated in GnomAD database, 1025 SNVs and INDELs of
various frequencies, functional impact and localization have been described in
TMPRSS2 gene. This list includes 332 missense variants, 17 frameshits, 64 splice sites
variants, 14 stop codon mutations and 3 inframe INDELs. But among frequent variants
(MAF > 0.01) there are only 13 intronic polymorphisms, 5 synonymous variants and 2
missense mutations (rs12329760 and rs75603675). Both missense variants have high
frequencies (24.8% and 35.0% in gnomAD, respectively) (Table 1). The variant
rs12329760 is the mutation of C to T in the position 589 of the gene that led to change
of valine to methionine in the amino acid position 197 (exon 7) of transmembrane
protease serine 2 isoform 1, or in position 160 (exon 6) of isoform 2. This mutation is
predicted by Poly-Phen-2 to be probably damaging with a score of 0.997 (sensitivity:
0.41; specificity: 0.98). The allele T of the TMPRSS2 rs12329760, was positively
associated with TMPRSS2-ERG fusion by translocation and also was associated with
increased risk for prostate cancer in European and Indian populations [5, 11]. The
rs75603675 (C to A transition in position 23, Gly8Val) was not reported to be
associated with prostate cancer or with other clinical condition.
An interesting feature of both frequent missense variants is the difference in
prevalence between European and Asian populations. Rs12329760 is 15% more frequent
in populations of East Asia (38%) than in European populations (23%). For rs75603675
the difference is even more significant: minor allele reaches 42% in European
populations and about 1% in populations of East Asia.
As to CNV, controlDB database contains only one deletion in TMPRSS2 gene (1
copy variant) with relatively low frequency (1.2%) (Table 2)

Frequency of protein changing allelic variants of the TMPRSS2
gene in populations of North Eurasia
In order to study the population differentiation in TMPRSS2 functional variants in more
details, we searched for TMPRSS2 allelic frequency in our own unpublished data on 76
populations of North Eurasia based on 1836 samples genotyped using genome-wide
microarrays. Four missense mutations and two CNV in TMPRSS2 gene were found in
our dataset. We summarized the frequency of TMPRSS2 missense mutations in North
Eurasian population (Table 3) in comparison to worldwide data (Table 4). Three
missense mutations (rs148125094, rs143597099, and rs201093031) were very rare
variants, while rs12329760, previously associated with prostate cancer, were found with
high frequency in all populations. The data on the second high-frequency missense
variant in TMPRSS2 gene according to GnomAD database (s75603675) were not
available because of the absence of this SNP in the microarray used in our study. The
minor allele of variant rs148125094 was found on only 2 chromosomes (total frequency
0,00054) – in single heterozygous individuals from Karelian and Abkhaz populations.
The variant rs143597099 was present only in one heterozygote from the Veps population.
The variant rs201093031 was found in North-East Asian Nivkh and Udege populations
with the frequency of 7%, and in a single Tuvan individual from Siberia. The frequency
of the probably damaging minor allele of the rs12329760 polymorphism ranged between
10% (in Khvarshi population from Dagestan) and 63% (in Sagays Khakas). In general,
the minor allele T has higher frequency in Siberia and Central Asia (both around 35%),
while lowest frequency of the damaging variant was found in North Caucasus (19%),
Dagestan (22%), and Eastern Europe (29%). This distribution correlates with the
worldwide data demonstrating much higher frequency of the minor allele in Asian
populations (36 – 41%) comparing to Europeans (22-24%) (see Table 4).
In addition, we detected CNV in 2 samples. In the first case, an increase in the
number of copies covering the entire gene was found in the Karanogai individual.
Second CNV was a affecting exons 3-7 fiund in a single Kumyk individual.
Thus potentially functionally significant variant in TMPRSS2 gene were found in
many human populations in relatively high frequency, demonstrating region-specific
distribution patterns. Both variants – probably damaging SNV and heterozygous
deletion of the gene – may significantly contribute to the interaction of the human
serine protease with the viral spike proteins changing the efficacy of the priming of viral
proteins by the TMPRSS2 protease. However, the role of TMPRSS2 gene and its
variants in the interaction with SARS-CoV-2 and in viral infectivity still needs to be
elucidated.

Regulation of expression of TMPRSS2

181

eQTLs

182

According to the GTEx Analysis V8 database, the TMPRSS2 gene contains 136 eQTLs
(including 60 down-regulating and 76 up-regulating variants) that significantly alters its
expression in lung tissues (Table 5). But in general, all these eQTLs have only minor
effect on gene expression. The average slope of the regression line (value that
characterized the strength of eQTL effect) is around 0.09 both for down- and
up-regulating variants. The strongest single variant can change the expression by 13%.

Top 30 microRNAs predicted to regulate TMPRSS2 and BSG were analyzed for
enrichment in various cell types using FANTOM5 database. None of the top miRNAs is
enriched in lung or respiratory tract cells, but 3 miRNAs showed slight expression in
immune and endothelial cells (Table. 6).
Pharmaco-transcriptomics of TMPRSS2

197

According to the DRUGBANK database, 9 drugs can reduce the level of expression of
TMPRSS2. For 5 of them (Acetaminophen / Paracetamol, Curcumin, Cyclosporine,
and Ethinylestradiol) this effect is clinically approved (Table 7). Information on the
direction of the effect of Estradiol is conflicting – in different experiments it shows
downregulation or upregulation effect on TMPRSS2 expression.
Two drugs from the list above (Acetaminophen / Paracetamol and Curcumin) were
also considered as a possible therapy for COVID-19 [3]. Acetaminophen is currently
being discussed as a possible drug for the correction of fever in patients with COVID-19.
The discovered feature of this drug to reduce the level of expression of TMPRSS2 may
be an additional argument in favor of its use, compared with other NSAIDs. Curcumin,
a widely used food supplement, has the predicted ability to block Main Protease (Mpro)
of SARS-CoV-2 [20], and may be studied further in relation to COVID-19 therapy.

TMPRSS2 protein plays a crucial role in the process of SARS-CoV-2 activation in the
human cells. The gene encoding this protease demonstrates high level of genetic
variability as well as many variants which may regulate its expression levels. Despite
very few potential functionally significant variants in the gene are of relatively high
frequency, population-specific patterns of TMPRSS2 variability may contribute in some
extent to the different viral infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in populations of various
geographic origins.
TMPRSS2 is probably co-expressed with SARS-CoV-2 receptors (ACE2 and BSG),
but only the TMPRSS2 protease demonstrates tissue –specific expression an alveolar
cell, target cell type for SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is an indication that TMPRSS2 is
potentially the most promising target for COVID-19 therapy, based on the specific
expression in lung, its important role in the process of cell infection and communication
with other proteins involved in the infection process. Several well studied drugs can
downregulate the expression of TMPRSS2 in human cells, including Acetaminophen
(Paracetamol) and Curcumin. Both deserve close attention as possible anti-COVID-19
drugs due to their approved effects on TMPRSS2 expression, as well as because of a
long history of their use, known side effects, and wide availability.
