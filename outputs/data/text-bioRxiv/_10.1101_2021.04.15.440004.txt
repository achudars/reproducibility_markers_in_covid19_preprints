Abstract
New affordable therapeutic protocols for COVID-19 are urgently needed despite the increasing
number of effective vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. To this end, there is increasing
attention towards computational methods for drug repositioning and de novo drug design.
Here, we systematically integrated multiple data-driven computational approaches to perform
virtual screening and prioritize candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. From the set of
prioritized drugs, we selected a subset of representative candidates to test in human cells. Two
compounds, 7-hydroxystaurosporine and bafetinib, showed synergistic antiviral effects in our in
vitro experiments, and strongly inhibited viral-induced syncytia formation. Moreover, since
existing drug repositioning methods provide limited usable information for de novo drug design,
we extracted and prioritized the chemical substructures of the identified drugs, providing a
chemical vocabulary that may help to design new effective drugs.

Introduction
The rapid diffusion of the COVID-19 pandemic has called for a prompt reaction from the
biomedical research community. Although new vaccines have been developed as preventive
options against the infection spreading (Deb et al., 2021; Thanh Le et al., 2020), little is still
known about their efficacy (Callaway and Mallapaty; Mallapaty and Callaway), especially
against variants of the virus. Furthermore, even if monoclonal antibody-based therapies represent
an appealing option to treat the most severe cases of COVID-19, they are expensive and not easy
to mass produce (Jaworski, 2020). Thus, more effective and affordable treatments for COVID-19
are still required to support medical intervention for the disease worldwide.
Currently available therapeutic options target components of the viral life cycle (e.g. nucleotide
analogs or broad-spectrum antiviral drugs), the host immunological response (anti-inflammatory
drugs or monoclonal antibodies), or vascular acute damage (antihypertensive and anticoagulant
drugs) (Boccia et al., 2020; Giannis et al., 2020; Kaddoura et al., 2020; Pavel et al., 2021; Pujari
et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020). The angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the
transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) may serve as therapeutic targets due to their
crucial role in the initial phases of the viral infection (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Ni et al., 2020).
Antivirals, especially antiretrovirals, represent the class of therapeutic agents which has been
investigated to a larger extent (Frediansyah et al., 2021; Jomah et al., 2020). Various other drug
classes were also proposed, such as anticancer drugs (e.g. kinase inhibitors) and antimicrobials
(Lima et al., 2020; Malek et al., 2020). However, the majority of clinical trials focus on
hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with other compounds (38.65%), followed by
immunotherapeutic (33.13%), and antiviral agents (9.20%) (Babaei et al., 2020) .

Given the cost and time required for de novo drug development, drug repositioning is emerging
as a viable solution (Dotolo et al., 2021; Jia et al., 2020; Napolitano et al., 2013; Rameshrad et
al., 2020). Several efforts have been made to experimentally screen large libraries of candidate
compounds (Ellinger et al., 2020; Gordon et al., 2020; Heiser et al., 2020; Touret et al., 2020).
However, high-throughput screenings have a substantial cost in terms of time and resources. An
in silico selection of candidate drugs with predicted desired activity would then reduce the need
of experimental screenings. Several computational approaches to drug repositioning are
available, either focusing on the targeting patterns of drugs to cellular components (Gordon et al.,
2020), or based on the investigation of the mechanism of action (MOA) of drugs by omics
profiling (Altay et al., 2020; Lima et al., 2020). However, there is a lack of integrative
approaches that combine and enhance robustness of the predictions as well as provide useful
information for de novo design of new compounds. Here, we propose a novel integrated
computational approach to prioritize candidate drugs for treating COVID-19.
We prioritized compounds from the whole DrugBank library by virtual screening, and selected
23 candidates for in vitro infection assays to reveal drugs with potential antiviral activity against
SARS-CoV-2. 7-Hydroxystaurosporine and bafetinib showed significant antiviral effect in
human epithelial cells. Interestingly, the two drugs also revealed a synergistic effect in blocking
virus-induced syncytia formation. Furthermore, our analytical framework allows the
prioritization of relevant chemical substructures, which could serve as a molecular fragment
library for de novo drug development for COVID-19.

Results and discussion

Computationally aided drug prioritization identifies a subset of candidate drugs for
COVID-19
We focused on multiple aspects relevant for the prioritization of candidate drugs for COVID-19
treatment (Figure 1A). We analyzed publicly available transcriptomics data to characterize both
the MOA of drugs (Igarashi et al., 2015) as well as the disease-specific alterations (Blanco-Melo
et al., 2020; Daamen et al., 2021). We highlighted chemical substructures present in drugs that
are able to: (1) alter the expression of genes related to the initial phases of the viral infection
(Gordon et al., 2020), (2) revert the virus-induced transcriptomic alteration, and (3) target key
genes of the host response to the SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we identified structural properties of
drugs predictive of the deregulation level of the ACE2 receptor, the transmembrane protease
TMPRSS2, and the cell surface proteolytic enzymes cathepsin B (CTSB) and procathepsin L
(CTSL). Finally, we retrieved chemical substructures from drugs that were identified as active in
previous screenings for COVID-19.
To identify candidate drugs effective against COVID-19, we computationally prioritized drugs
from the DrugBank database (Wishart et al., 2006, 2018) with PubChem-available fingerprints
(Figure 1B). We prioritize these drugs according to the presence of chemical substructures
expected to interfere with disease-associated biological processes. From 8000 total drugs
examined, we focused on the top 700 to select a set of relevant candidates for further
experimental validation. Our inclusion criteria is a trade-off between the selection of a set of
drugs that best represents the top of the prioritized list, based on their chemical substructures
(Figure 1C), and a number of practical considerations such as price, availability, shipping time,

and ease of storage. Taking into account the aforementioned criteria, we validated our method by
performing an in vitro biological evaluation of 23 selected drugs.
The majority of drugs currently in clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment present either antiviral
or immunomodulating properties, with the aim of targeting the viral life cycle and alleviating the
lung-damaging symptoms (Babaei et al., 2020; Wang and Guan). Kinases play an important role
in multiple of these biological processes, and therefore, different kinase inhibitors were proposed
for COVID-19 treatment (Saha et al., 2020; Weisberg et al., 2020). These compounds show
pharmacodynamic properties allowing the dual goal of mitigating both host immunological
response and antiviral activity (Weisberg et al., 2020). Twelve out of the 23 identified drugs
relate to oncological treatments, and eight of them act as kinase inhibitors (Figure 1D). Similarly
to antiviral drugs, anticancer drugs may, indeed, target biological processes which have a crucial
role in modulating the organism immune response, cell division and death, cell signaling, and
microenvironment generation (Borcherding et al., 2020). Several studies about repurposing of
anticancer drugs to treat COVID-19 already exist (Borcherding et al., 2020; Braga et al., 2021;
Saini et al., 2020, 2020). Roshewski et al. showed that acalabrutinib, a selective Bruton tyrosine
kinase inhibitor, can mitigate the hyperinflammatory immune response characterising the most
severe cases of COVID-19 (Roschewski et al., 2020). The histone methyltransferase inhibitor
pinometostat, instead, seems to decrease the level of NFkB, one of the main players of the
immunological response (Hirano and Murakami, 2020), and to mitigate the host-response against
infections (Marcos-Villar and Nieto, 2019). Inhibitors of intracellular calcium homeostasis seem
to block virus-induced cell‚Äìcell fusion (known as syncytia formation), one of the hallmarks of
severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (Braga et al., 2021; Bussani et al., 2020).

23 selected compounds are shown in red. They were selected among the drugs sharing the most
relevant substructure as well as satisfying practical logistic criteria. Of the 23 drugs, the 2

characterization and description of known association with COVID-19 of the 23 tested drugs. In

their potential therapeutic role in literature.

Our analysis successfully highlighted several drugs that are either under investigation or acted
effectively against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The selected 23 candidates for further investigation
comprise anticancer, antimicrobial, and antiviral drugs (Figure 1D). Drugs from all three classes
showed to lower the virus titre and to tune down the cytokine storm syndrome in the most severe
cases of the disease (Ginsburg and Klugman, 2020). As expected, our approach identified
antiviral drugs (against hepatitis C), which were already predicted as a COVID-19 treatment, or
are currently in clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2 infection1 (Jockusch et al., 2020; Mevada et
al., 2020). Among the three identified antibiotics, delafloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial
agent, was also studied for its antiviral activity at the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic
(Karampela and Dalamaga, 2020).
Altogether, approximately half of the tested candidate drugs were proposed as a potential
COVID-19 treatment (Figure 1D). This demonstrates the capability of our methodology to
identify potential drug candidates and to highlight a new set of existing compounds without
previous association to COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2.

Validation in human cells confirmed 7-hydroxystaurosporine and bafetinib as potential
COVID-19 treatment
To experimentally validate our computational predictions, we tested the set of candidate drugs at
different concentrations (0.09 ŒºM, 0.9 ŒºM, and 9 ŒºM) on HEK-293T cells stably expressing
human ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (HEK-293T-AT) (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020). Cells were
infected with WT SARS-CoV-2, at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 infectious units (i.u.)
per cell for 16-18 h. The percentage of infected cells was determined by immunofluorescence
detection of viral proteins followed by automated imaging and image analysis. Out of the 23
drugs, 7-hydroxystaurosporine and bafetinib, showed a statistically significant inhibition of the
number of virus-infected cells when tested at 9 ŒºM, showing relative infection values of 0.51 and
0.69, respectively (Figure 2A). Ponatinib, instead, significantly inhibited the infection but also
displayed a strong cytotoxic effect (Figure 2A), and was therefore excluded from further
analysis.
7-Hydroxystaurosporine is an antineoplastic agent with potent in vitro and in vivo activities, and
its capability of sensitising a variety of cell lines in vitro was previously described (Lara et al.,
2005; Monks et al., 2000). 7-Hydroxystaurosporine is often used in combination with other drugs
for its synergistic effect of enhancing cytotoxic effect in human cancer cells, e.g. in treating

leukemia2 (Monks et al., 2000; Sampath et al., 2006; Senderowicz, 2001). To our knowledge, no
connection between 7-hydroxystaurosporine and SARS-CoV-2 emerged in terms of possible
COVID-19 treatment. Bafetinib, is a second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor prescribed
against Philadelphia chromosome‚Äìpositive chronic myelogenous leukemia (Santos et al., 2010).
In addition, bafetinib was recently identified as a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor in other drug
repurposing studies (Bouhaddou et al., 2020; Drayman et al., 2020). Bouhadduo et al. proposed
and tested bafetinib as a possible COVID-19 drug, modifying the phosphoproteome of
SARS-CoV-2 infected cells in vitro (Bouhaddou et al., 2020).

7-Hydroxystaurosporine and bafetinib inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection
Next, we tested whether a combination of the two identified compounds would result in stronger
antiviral activity without compromising cell viability. For this, we performed two additional
infection assays in which we exposed the cells to 7-hydroxystaurosporine and bafetinib alone, or
in combination. In the first assay, the concentration of bafetinib was fixed at 3 ŒºM, while the
concentration of 7-hydroxystaurosporine varied as 0.9 ŒºM, 3 ŒºM, and 9 ŒºM (Figure 2B). In the
second assay, the concentration of 7-hydroxystaurosporine was fixed at 3 ŒºM, while the
concentration of bafetinib varied as in the first assay (Figure 2C). The cells were exposed to the
drugs 2 hours before infection (hbi).
These results indicate that 7-hydroxystaurosporine had a significant inhibitory effect on viral
infection already at 3 ŒºM (Figure 2B), without remarkable cytotoxic effects. The combination
with bafetinib resulted in an increased antiviral activity, reducing the number of infected cells by
more than 80%, without compromising cell viability (Figure 2B). The same applies for bafetinib,

which showed a moderate but significant antiviral activity already at 3 ŒºM and the activity was
even stronger when combined with 7-hydroxystaurosporine (Figure 2C).
To test if the drugs blocked SARS-CoV-2 cell entry, which occurs during the first hour of
infection (Koch et al., 2020), or a post-entry step of the virus life cycle, we added the drugs 2
hours post-infection (hpi) and quantified the fraction of infected cells 16 hpi. We observed a
similar antiviral effect in cells treated after infection, indicating that the drugs inhibit mainly a
post-entry step of infection.
The effect of the two drugs was tested in a different cell line, Caco-2 cells stably overexpressing
ACE2 (Caco2-ACE2) and endogenously expressing TMPRSS2 (Figure 2D). The antiviral effect
of 7-hydroxystaurosporine, bafetinib, and of the two drugs combined, was stronger compared to
HEK-293T-AT. At a concentration of 3 ŒºM, the infection inhibition was more than 60%, 80%,
and 90%, respectively (Figures 2D‚ÄìE).
Both bafetinib and 7-hydroxystaurosporine exhibited a concentration-dependent inhibition of
viral infection (Figure 3) and predicted benchmark dose (BMD) values of 1.22 ŒºM and 5.09 ŒºM
respectively (Figures 3A‚ÄìB). The predicted BMD values of the combination were 0.63 ŒºM and
0.65 ŒºM (Figures 3C‚ÄìD), suggesting that lower concentrations might be already effective to
reduce the infection rate.

7-hydroxystaurosporine (B) and their combinations (C‚ÄìD). The y-axes show the infection rate
normalized by the one measured in the DMSO. Bafetinib and 7-hydroxystaurosporine were
tested at 0.09 ŒºM, 0.9 ŒºM, 3 ŒºM, and 9 ŒºM, while in combination they were tested at 0.9 ŒºM, 3
ŒºM, and 9 ŒºM. The BMD, BMDL, and BMDU in (C) refer to the experiments performed where
7-hydroxystaurosporine was combined with a fixed concentration (3 ŒºM) while bafetinib
concentration varied.
7-Hydroxystaurosporine and bafetinib synergistically block SARS-CoV-2‚Äìinduced cell‚Äìcell
fusion
The ability of some pathogenic human viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, to induce cell‚Äìcell
fusion, a phenomenon known as syncytia formation (Buchrieser et al., 2021), was linked to viral
spreading, pathogenicity and tissue damage in vivo (Bussani et al., 2020). When infected by
SARS-CoV-2, HEK-293T-AT cells efficiently fuse, forming large multinucleated cells (Figure

4A). In addition to a reduction in the number of infected cells, a machine learning‚Äìassisted
image analysis revealed that 7-hydroxystaurosporine, at 4.5 ŒºM, strongly inhibited virus-induced
cell‚Äìcell fusion, reducing the average nuclear content per cell by more than 80% (Figure 4A‚ÄìB).
The combination with bafetinib increased this inhibitory effect, reducing the formation of large
multinucleated cells by more than 90% and 60%, at 4.5 ŒºM and 2.25 ŒºM, respectively (Figure
4B). At the lowest concentration, 7-hydroxystaurosporine had a moderate inhibitory effect on
syncytia formation, whereas the combination with bafetinib significantly blocked cell‚Äìcell fusion
even at 1.125 ŒºM (Figure 4B).
By targeting ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters, bafetinib is known to increase the intracellular
accumulation of anticancer drugs by blocking the drug efflux (Zhang et al., 2016). This could be
a plausible mechanism for how this inhibitor enhances the effect of 7-hydroxystaurosporine.
Interestingly, in addition to allowing drug efflux, this group of ABC transporters was recognised
for their role in syncytialization (Manceau et al., 2012). Buchrieser et al. and Ou et al.
highlighted connections between multinucleated syncytial cells and, similarly to other viruses
such as measles, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and MERS, SARS-CoV-2 induces cell‚Äìcell
fusion, a phenomenon particularly evident in in severe COVID-19 (Buchrieser et al., 2020; Ou et
al., 2020). Sisk et al. demonstrated that the membrane fusion is blocked in the presence of Abl
kinase inhibitors (imatinib, GNF2 and GNF5), and thus, prevented syncytia formation in
coronavirus (infectious bronchitis virus) spike protein‚Äìinduced Vero cells (Sisk et al., 2018).
More recently, another study demonstrated that the fusogenic activity of the viral spike can be
inhibited by targeting cellular factors (Braga et al., 2021).

Structural comparison between 7-hydroxystaurosporine and bafetinib
As 7-hydroxystaurosporine and bafetinib exhibited the highest inhibitory activity against
SARS-CoV-2 infection at low micromolar concentrations, we investigated further their 2-D
structures and 3-D geometries. In terms of molecular fingerprints, most of the common
substructures highlighted aromaticity-related similarities. In fact, based on their 2-D structures
(Figure 5A), both candidates possess a highly conjugated œÄ-bond system with 22 and 27

sp2-hybridized atoms for 7-hydroxystaurosporine and bafetinib, respectively. Fused aromatic
rings and high degree of conjugation suggest a planar geometry, which was confirmed when we
generated and compared their 3-D models (Figures 5B‚ÄìD). Despite the different nature of their
2-D structural scaffolds, the generated 3-D geometries overlayed and displayed a 67%
shape-similarity, which may partially explain their antiviral activity in the biological assays. The
3-D conformation generated for bafetinib is in line with the model presented by Zhang et al.
(Zhang et al., 2016), with the ligand docked into the binding pocket of ABCG2 efflux
transporter. An inhibition of such efflux transporter also supports the possible explanation for the
synergistic effect when

the compounds were used

in combination. However, as

7-hydroxystaurosporine and bafetinib lowered the infection rate also when tested alone, a clear
explanation for their intrinsic antiviral activity remains yet unknown. Of note, the drug candidate
K-252a shares the same aromatic and planar core of 7-hydroxystaurosporine, however, it did not
show inhibitory activity in the biological assays. The lack of its intrinsic activity may be due to
the missing hydroxy group in the isoindolinone moiety and/or to the different substituents (e.g.
the lack of a basic functional group) and number of the sp3-hybridized carbon atoms in the
conformationally distinct aliphatic heterocyclic moieties, i.e. tetrahydro-2H-pyran and
tetrahydrofuran in 7-hydroxystaurosporine and K-252a, respectively.

Conclusive remarks
We prioritized the DrugBank database for potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors by using a
computational procedure. To achieve that, we integrated established methodologies from the
fields of bioinformatics and cheminformatics. We experimentally assayed 23 representatives of
the prioritized library and found that two drugs, bafetinib and 7-hydroxystaurosporine, showed

significant inhibition of viral infection. In addition, an image analysis of the infected versus
treated cells showed that the formation of multinucleated syncytial cells was also significantly
reduced. Unexpectedly, when combined, the two drugs exerted an even stronger, synergistic
inhibition of viral infection as well as cell‚Äìcell fusion inhibition at lower concentrations. Further
in vitro experimentation showed that the drugs in combination were still effective one hour after
the infection of the cells, suggesting that they may hinder some post-entry mechanism of the
virus. The prioritization methodology we developed allowed us to make an informed decision
about which drugs to test, out of almost 8000 drugs from DrugBank, thus significantly reducing
the costs of drug repurposing, while simultaneously increasing the success rate. Also, our results
are not limited to candidate repositionable drugs, but include a characterization in terms of
chemical substructures relevant to the viral system considered. Indeed, we conjecture that this set
of chemical substructures can be further exploited in the context of scaffold-based de novo drug
design. We believe that our integrated approach could significantly help the repurposing of drugs
for other viral diseases, as well as other complex pathologies.

Materials and Methods
RNA-Seq data preprocessing
Human transcriptomics datasets analysed in this study were retrieved from the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) repository, annotated with the GEO ID GSE147507 (Blanco-Melo et al., 2020;
Daamen et al., 2021). The datasets are composed as following: human lung biopsies of
SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and uninfected control; A549 cell line infected with
SARS-CoV-2, A549 cell line infected with SARS-CoV-2 overexpressing ACE2, Calu-3 cells

infected with SARS-CoV-2; NHBE cell line infected with SARS-CoV-2. For each of the cell
lines, the mock treated lines were collected to be used as controls for the expression analysis.
The preprocessing of human transcriptomics datasets was carried out starting from the raw
counts provided within the GEO record. Low read counts were filtered by applying the
proportion test method implemented within the NOISeq Bioconductor package (Tarazona et al.,
2011). Filtered counts were then normalized through the upper quartile method implemented in
the NOISeq package. Differential expression analysis was carried out by using the DESeq2
Bioconductor package (Love et al., 2014) and the p values were adjusted using the
Benjamini-Hochberg method (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

Co-expression network inference and analysis
Co-expression networks were inferred for both the human biopsies and all the infected cell lines
by using the clr algorithm (Faith et al., 2007) implemented in the minet package (Meyer et al.,
2008) with Pearson correlation as the estimator. The expression values of the differentially
expressed genes were used to infer the networks. The genes in each of the networks were ranked
based on several centrality measures, including degree, closeness, clustering coefficient,
betweenness and eigenvector, in addition to a biological significance score calculated as follows:

Raw microarray data for 129 drugs were downloaded from the Open TG-GATE repository3
(Igarashi et al., 2015). Drugs were tested in in vivo and in vitro rats samples (both in liver and

kidney) with three dose levels at four different time points. Samples were imported in R by using
the justRMA function (Irizarry et al., 2003) from the R library Affy (Gautier et al., 2004).
Outliers were identified by using the RLE, NUSE from the affyPLM package (2005) and the
slope of the RNA degradation curve implemented in the affy package (Gautier et al., 2004). A
sample was removed from the analysis, when marked as outlier by at least two out of the three
methods. The probes were annotated to Ensembl genes (by using the rat2302rnensgcdf (v.
22.0.0) annotation file from the brainarray website4, and the resulting expression matrix was
quantile normalized by using the normalizeQuantile function from the limma package.
Eventually, only the subset of samples tested in in vivo rat liver tissue with a single exposure
experimental setup were considered for further analysis and the ensembl genes were mapped to
gene symbols by using the AnnotationDBi package (Pag√®s et al., 2018).

Dynamic dose-responsive point of departures
For each drug of the Open TG-GATEs, the dynamic dose-dependent MOA and the
corresponding point-of-departure (POD) were identified through the use of the TinderMIX
software (Serra et al., 2020a). Starting from the pairwise log2-fold-change (log2FC) of each gene
(computed as the difference between the log2 expression values of each pair of treated and
control samples), first-, second- and third-order polynomial models were fitted. For the
best-fitting model its contour plot was computed as an effect map. Next, the contour plot of each
gene was evaluated to identify an area showing a dynamic dose-response, i.e. an area where the
expression changes monotonically in respect to the dose once an activity threshold has been
reached. As for the classical BMD analysis, an activity threshold of 10% was selected (Serra et

al., 2020b; Thomas et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2007). If such an area was identified, the gene was
considered to be altered in a dynamic dose-dependent manner.
Eventually, based on the lowest dose and earliest time of activation, the genes were labelled with
an activation label that specifies its POD. The time-dose effect map was divided into a 3 by 3
grid. The sections of the dose axis were named ‚ÄúS" (sensitive), "I" (intermediate), and "R"
(resilient), while for the time axis, the labels "E" (early), "M" (middle), and ‚ÄúL‚Äù (late), were
assigned. The final label was then obtained by identifying the earliest and most sensitive point of
activation and concatenating the dose and time of the single labels.

Drug prioritization strategies
Dose-dependent SARS-CoV-2 physical interactors
The list of physical interactors with the SARS-CoV-2 were also retrieved from Gordon et al.
(Gordon et al., 2020). The list of SARS-CoV-2 physical interactors identified by Gordon et al.
was translated to human gene symbols using the R biomaRt package (Durinck et al., 2009). In
this manuscript they are referred to as Gordon‚Äôs genes. The Gordon‚Äôs genes were mapped to the
rattus norvegicus ortholog genes using the R biomaRt package (Durinck et al., 2005, 2009).
Then, for each drug in the Open TG-GATEs, a score was computed by summing the number of
Gordon‚Äôs genes that were considered dynamic-dose-responsive by the TinderMIX analysis, and

Differentially expressed genes in SARS-CoV-2 samples

Similarly, the differentially expressed genes (DEG) identified for the human lung biopsy of
SARS-CoV-2 patient, the A549, Calu-3 and NHBE cell lines infected with (SARS-CoV-2) and
the A549 cell line infected with SARS-CoV-2 overexpressing ACE2, were mapped to their
corresponding rat genes. Then, for each drug in the Open TG-GATEs a score was computed by
summing the number of DEG genes in each SARS-CoV-2 condition, that were identified as
dynamic-dose-responsive by the TinderMIX analysis, and their strength of deregulation. This
resulted in five different ranks of the Open TG-GATEs drugs, where the drugs that strongly
deregulate the same DEG of each SARS-CoV-2 condition are at the top of the list.

to

The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
(Subramanian et al., 2005), was used to compute the pairwise similarity between the Open
TG-GATEs drugs and the SARS-CoV-2 conditions. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test can be used
to compare a sample with a reference probability distribution. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic
was used without the absolute value in order to preserve the sign (Napolitano et al., 2016). This
helps understanding if the increasing and decreasing dynamic-dose-responsive genes derived

from the Open TG-GATEs drugs are up- or down-regulated in the SARS-CoV-2 conditions.
Thus, for each of the SARS-CoV-2 conditions, and for increasing or decreasing
dynamic-dose-responsive behaviour, the Open TG-GATEs drugs were ranked based on their
capability to reverse the transcriptomic alterations due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection weighted by
the GSEA statistical relevance.

Drugs targets and co-expression analysis
All data annotated in the OpenTargets database5 (Ochoa et al., 2021) were retrieved as a
compressed JSON file. These data contain the drug‚Äìtargets associations used in this study. The
targets were mapped on the previously computed co-expression network and their rank from the
INfORM (Marwah et al., 2018) strategies were retrieved. The drugs were ranked according to
the median rank of their corresponding targets. In this way, drugs whose targets are more central
to the network are ranked at the top of the list.

Drug ranking with Borda
Eventually, all the lists of ranked drugs were merged together by using the Borda method
(Schimek et al., 2015) implemented in the R package TopKLists. In this way, a final consensus
on the drug ranks was identified.

Relevant chemical substructures
A GSEA analysis was performed to identify the presence of statistically enriched chemical
substructure in the drugs ranked at the top of the list. A binary matrix with 881 chemical

substructures and 129 drugs was created. A drug was assigned to the list of a specific
substructure if that drug contains the substructure. Again, a substructure was considered
statistically enriched if the p value of the GSEA was lower than 0.05.

Quantitative Structure‚ÄìActivity Relationship Analysis
Data preprocessing
A quantitative structure‚Äìactivity relationship (QSAR) analysis (Gramatica, 2020) was performed
on the Open TG-GATEs drugs using the pairwise levels of differential expression of a chosen set
of genes as the response variable. Namely, ACE2, TMPRSS2, CTSB and CTSL were used. For
each gene, the expression levels at all dose levels and time points were considered
simultaneously. The initial dataset for each gene comprised the pairwise differential expression
levels at all the doses and all the time points.
In order to differentiate the expression values, a set of dummy variables were added to represent
both the dose level and the time points. Substructure fingerprints for the Open TG-GATEs drugs
were retrieved from PubChem6 (Kim et al., 2016) by querying it by CID identifiers. Each
differential expression level was represented by the set of binary fingerprints retrieved by
PubChem plus seven indicator variables: three to represent the dose levels, and four to represent
the sacrifice periods. Thus, the size of each initial dataset was of 1463 differential expression
levels times 888 binary features.
Each of the 881 bits forming the fingerprint indicate the presence or absence of particular
chemical substructures, ranging from counts of single atoms, to the presence and the type of
bonds between atoms, to more complex substructures like aromatic rings.

Since the fingerprint data matrix was sparse, it was preprocessed by removing all the fingerprints
absent in any drug of the dataset manipulating the data matrix with the python module pandas
(McKinney, 2010). After this step, the number of variables to use in the modeling phase was
further reduced by evaluating the correlation coefficient between each pair, and, to obtain a valid
distance metric among the features, the correlation matrix C was transformed according to
2

1 ‚àí ùê∂ (Van Dongen and Enright, 2012). DBSCAN (Ester et al., 1996) clustering implemented
in the python module scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011), was then applied with parameters
epsilon=0.1 and the minimum number of samples as 2. In this way an automatic grouping of the
most correlated variables was obtained. Finally, each cluster of correlated variables is
compressed into a single one. The resulting data matrix was reduced to about 400 variables.

Modeling
After preprocessing, the data were modeled using a gradient boosting machine (GBM)
(Friedman, 2001) from the scikit-learn module (Pedregosa et al., 2011), with decision trees as
weak learners and the squared loss function. The number of estimators was fixed to 500 for
computational constraints and instead we explored different regularization parameters
configurations. A grid of possible parameter settings was explored using a 5-fold
cross-validation repeated 25 times for each combination of parameters. The grid of parameters
was defined as follows,
- subsample, the proportion of samples to use to train each individual tree ranged in [0.2, 0.8],
- max_features, the number of features to evaluate at each node ranged in [1, 50],
- learning_rate, the magnitude of the learning rate varied between [0.001, 0.1],
- max_depth, the maximum height of each decision tree ranged in [1, 5],

- criterion, the function used to evaluate each split was one of {‚Äúmse‚Äù, ‚Äúmae‚Äù, ‚Äúfriedman_mse‚Äù}.
Performances of each fitted model were evaluated on the corresponding held-out fold. Due to the
lack of an external validation dataset, only internal validation of the fitting was performed. For
this reason, the parameters corresponding to the most regularized (i.e. parsimonious) models
within one standard deviation from the minimum error achieved were chosen (Hastie et al.,
2009).
The

best

model

parameters

were

identified

as

subsample=0.5,

learning_rate=0.1,

max_features=8, criterion=‚Äùmse‚Äù, max_depth=3 which resulted in a trade-off between validation
accuracy, regularization and computing time. The best performing models had a validation
RMSE loss of 1.5 ¬± 0.6.
When the most appropriate parameters were selected for each gene, the best models were fit
again using the whole dataset, to obtain the final predictors. Since each drug fingerprint
representation appears more than once in the dataset due to the different sacrifice periods and
dose levels, care must be taken when considering splits of the dataset into train and validation
sets. To this end, every model trained in these experiments was fit and evaluated on datasets split
at the drug level, meaning that all instances of a drug are in either the training or validation sets.
This is to avoid any information leakage that could happen when some of the dose levels or time
points of the same drug are split across the training and validation sets.

Chemical substructure relevance
After fitting, each model was exploited to identify the most relevant fingerprints, which, on
average, are mostly associated with the over- or under- expression of the analysed genes. To this
end, the partial dependence (Friedman, 2001) of the predicted outcome on each fingerprint was
computed. Since the optimal selected models fitted decision trees with a maximum depth higher

than 1, feature interactions made the ranking slightly unstable, so the fit was repeated for each
model 250 times and the relevance of each molecular substructure across the runs was averaged.
Finally, each feature was ranked based on its contribution to the average predicted level of
differential expression. Each molecular substructure was considered as relevant for under- (resp.
over-) expression if the 75th (resp. 25th) percentile of the partial dependence of the response
variable is lower (resp. higher) than 0.

Chemical substructures in screened drugs
A dataset of 6975 chemical compounds screened for activity against several cytotoxicity
endpoints from the literature was collected (Ellinger et al., 2020; Gordon et al., 2020; Heiser et
al., 2020). For each considered pair of drug and endpoint, an activity threshold was defined in the
same way as in the original articles. These activity thresholds were used to define an activity
binary variable for each screened drug. The same kind of fingerprints of chemical substructures
were also collected for this dataset and a chi2 statistical test was performed on each chemical
substructure feature against the activity variable to identify the chemical substructures
statistically relevant (p value < 0.05) to the activity threshold.

Drugs prioritization
The DrugBank database7 v. 5.0 was retrieved for this study. DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2006,
2018) contains 13579 drug entries, including 2635 approved small molecule drugs, and over
6375 experimental drugs. The DrugBank IDs were matched with the PubChem8 (Kim et al.,

2016) Compound ID (CID) using the PubChem Identifier Exchange Service9. For the 8775
matched compounds, substructure fingerprints were retrieved from PubChem by querying it by
CID identifiers.
To determine the overall ranking of the DrugBank dataset, we defined the final set of relevant
substructures as the union of the fingerprints derived from each single bioinformatics and
cheminformatics approach. We further constrained the overall set of relevant substructures by
considering its intersection with the set of relevant substructures derived from the screened drugs
found in the literature. The drugs were ranked according to the Tanimoto similarity (Bajusz et al.,
2015) with respect to the molecular substructures relevant to the models, and considered as
possible candidates for further investigation.

The structures of 7-hydroxystaurosporine and bafetinib (Figure 5) were generated in 3

that according to visual inspection faithfully represented the variation (cell size, morphology,
average intensity) of the whole dataset. We then randomly extracted a smaller area of 1024 √ó
1024 sized from each image, and normalized intensities by dividing with the global upper bound
of the intensities found in the original dataset and converted to 8-bit format. These selected
images were used to manually segment the contour of each N-labelled cell. After this fast initial
manual annotation, we utilized image augmentation techniques to prevent the model from
overfitting. We created an augmentation pipeline containing 7 main transformations where each
transformation instance is applied with a probability of 0.5 implemented using the Numpy
scientific programming library and the Pillow package10 for Python (Harris et al., 2020). Some of
the transformations have input parameters, in this case, the parameter is sampled from an interval
divided by step size of 0.01. We constructed 100 augmented instances of each image, therefore
we have (100 + 1) √ó 18 = 1818 images in the extended training set. We then trained the
state of the art Mask R-CNN (He et al., 2017) instance segmentation algorithm to detect the cell
instances with transfer learning by fine tuning a previous cytoplasm segmentation model to this
task. We trained the model through 13 epochs (full model 10 epoch and one epoch for the layers
4+, 3+ and heads), where each epoch contains 2000 steps with batch size of 1.

(W/V, Sigma) and 1 Œºg/ml Hoechst DNA staining (Thermo Fisher, cat no. H3570). After one
wash in D-BSA, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a 1:2000 dilution of a
polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against the viral N protein of SARS-CoV that cross-reacts with
the N protein of SARS-CoV (a kind gift of Prof. Ilkka Julkunen, University of Turku, Finland.
(Ziegler et al., 2005)). This antibody cross-reacts with SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Following two
washes in D-BSA, cells were incubated with a fluorescently labelled goat anti-rabbit antibody
(Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:1000 for 1 h at room temperature. After two washes in PBS,
cells were either stored in the same buffer at 4 ¬∞C or imaged directly with a Molecular Device
Nano high-content microscope using a 10√ó objective. To determine the percentage of infected
cells, the CellProfiler 3 open source software was used11. Nuclei stained with Hoechst were
detected using the Otsu algorithm of the CellProfiler3, and infected cells identified based on
fluorescence intensity of immunostained N in the perinuclear area of each cell, using a threshold
of fluorescence empirically determined such that less than 0.01% of non-infected cells was
detected as positive. The relative number of infected cells was calculated by dividing in each
well the number of N-positive nuclei by the total number of Hoechst-positive nuclei.

Quantification of inhibition
Image handling, quantification, and analysis of fluorescence images were performed as described
above using Cell profiler 3 or a custom made machine learning algorithm. For each experiment,
9 images were acquired and >2000 cells analyzed. Each experiment was repeated 3-4 times and
values indicated in each figure represent the average and standard deviation of all repetitions.
Analysis of significance was performed using a one-tailed t-test to identify drugs with an

infection rate lower than the DMSO. One asterisk= p<0.05; two asterisks= p<1e-5 after
Bonferroni correction.

Viral infection rate concentration-dependent analysis
A dose-dependent analysis was performed with the strategy implemented in the BMDx tool
(Serra et al., 2020b), to test if bafetinib, 7-hydroxystaurosporine, and their combination, reduce
the viral infection rate in a dose-dependent manner. For the analysis, the BMR threshold was set
to 10% difference with respect to the controls. The linear, power 2, power 3, power 4,
exponential, and hill functions were fitted to the data. The optimal fitting model was selected as
the one with the lowest Akaike information criteria and used to estimate the BMD, BMDL and
BMDU values. The number of replicates used in the concentration-dependent analyses varied
from 3 to 15 depending on the concentration level.
