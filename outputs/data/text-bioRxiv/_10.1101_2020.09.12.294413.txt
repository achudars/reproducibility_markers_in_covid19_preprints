Abstract

19

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome mediated by

20

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and was declared by WHO as a major international public health

21

concern. While worldwide efforts are being advanced towards vaccine development, the structural

22

modeling of TCR-pMHC (T Cell Receptor-peptide-bound Major Histocompatibility Complex) regarding

23

SARS-CoV-2 epitopes and the design of effective T cell vaccine based on these antigens are still

24

unresolved. Here, we present both pMHC and TCR-pMHC interfaces to infer peptide epitopes of the

25

SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Accordingly, significant TCR-pMHC templates (Z-value cutoff > 4) along with

26

interatomic interactions within the SARS-CoV-2-derived hit peptides were clarified. Also, we applied the

27

structural analysis of the hit peptides from different coronaviruses to highlight a feature of evolution in

28

SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, bat-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Peptide-protein flexible docking between each of

29

the hit peptides and their corresponding MHC molecules were performed, and a multi-hit peptides vaccine

30

against the S and N glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was designed. Filtering pipelines including antigenicity,

31

and also physiochemical properties of designed vaccine were then evaluated by different

32

immunoinformatics tools. Finally, vaccine-structure modeling and immune simulation of the desired

33

vaccine were performed aiming to create robust T cell immune responses. We anticipate that our design

34

based on the T cell antigen epitopes and the frame of the immunoinformatics analysis could serve as

35

valuable supports for the development of COVID-19 vaccine.

Introduction

60

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is determined as the causative agent

61

of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by public health professionals [1]. At the time of writing this

62

manuscript, researchers tend to focus their attention on describing the immune response against SARS-

63

CoV-2-derived B and T cell epitopes [2-4]. Although considerable efforts have been spent on clarifying the

64

SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, the used approaches often lack accurate T cell receptor (TCR) and peptide-bound

65

major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) binding models, which are crucial to initiate adaptive immunity

66

[5-10]. Thus, little is known about the relationship between an effective adaptive immune response and the

67

SARS-CoV-2 epitopes.

68

The recognition of antigen is a critical factor in T cell activation [11]. It has been well documented that the

69

TCR plays a key role in activating cell-mediated adaptive immune responses. In this process, the TCR

70

recognizes a peptide, obtained from a protein antigen, presented by MHC molecules, resulting in the

71

initiation of downstream signaling pathways within the T cell. Moreover, immunological studies have

72

found that MHC molecules will present selective peptides derived from a protein, indicating the significant

73

impact of predicting peptide-MHC binding towards identification of potential T cell epitopes [12]. These

74

findings acknowledge the necessity of further studies to provide insights into TCR–pMHC interactions and

75

binding mechanisms in order to select optimal peptide antigen (Hit peptide) for eliciting potent immune

76

responses against infectious diseases [13, 14]. In keeping with these observations, deep understanding of

77

the peptides originating from the SARS-CoV-2 proteins that could elicit T cell mediated immune response

78

may help in quest for the better development of a rational design of COVID-19 vaccine. To address these

79

issues, we applied a novel computational framework to calculate the interaction between TCRs and SARS-

80

CoV-2 antigen peptides whose recognition is restricted by human leukocyte antigen (HLA). Efficient

81

structural modeling of TCR-pMHC interaction from SARS-CoV-2 proteins could identify the appropriate

82

hit peptide(s), that with the following immunoinformatics analysis relating to the potential epitopes, is

83

expected to provide a beneficial data source for the development of COVID-19 vaccine.

89

protein (ORF6), ORF7a protein (ORF7a), ORF8 protein (ORF8), ORF10 protein (ORF10), and surface

90

glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 in FASTA format from different geographic regions including: China,

91

Wuhan (GenBank: MN90894) (as a reference SARS-CoV-2 isolate), India (Genbank: MT050493), Italy

92

(Genbank: MT066156), Nepal (Genbank: MT072688), Sweden (Genbank: MT093571), Brazil (Genbank:

95

MT256924), Peru (Genbank: MT263074), USA (Genbank: MT276329), and South Korea (Genbank:

96

MT304474) were retrieved from the GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) at the first of April

97

2020. Also, the entire viral proteome sequences from bat-CoV (Genbank: MG772921), MERS-CoV

98

(Genbank: KF958702), and SARS-CoV (Genbank: AY390556) were retrieved for further comparison

99

between the SARS-CoV-2 derived hit peptides and other coronaviruses.

100
101

Modeling of TCR–pMHC complex

102

The sequences of each protein were aligned using the CLC sequence viewer (Version 6.7.1). For

103

computing the final alignment, the sequences showing poor alignments were deleted and finally the

104

consensus sequences of each protein were extracted for using as an input for modeling of TCR–pMHC.

105

Then, each protein sequence in FASTA format was allocated by PAComplex server to forecast a model of

106

9- to 11-mer peptides bound to HLA-A0201, HLA-B0801, HLA-B3501, HLA-B3508, HLA-B4405, and

107

HLA-E-peptide-TCR template with Z values > 4.0 [15]. Moreover, an in-depth interaction among atoms,

108

model of binding, and amino acid sequences related to homologous peptide antigens were evaluated for

109

each query. Then, in order to evaluate the conserved regions and pairwise identity among SARS-CoV-2-

110

derived hit peptide and other coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and bat-CoV multiple

111

sequence alignment (MSA) was performed.

112

Prediction of immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2-derived hit peptide

113

Each SARS-CoV-2-derived hit peptide by same length that presented on the same HLA class I molecule

114

were analyzed through evaluation of the amino acid characteristics by T cell class I pMHC immunogenicity

115

tool [16]. Prediction results were sorted by descending score values. The higher score was indicated as a

116

greater probability of eliciting an immune response.

117
118

Study the binding mechanisms and interatomic interactions

119

For each hit peptides, hydrogen bonds (H-bond) and van der Waals (VDW) forces of pMHC and peptide-

120

TCR interfaces were calculated. Also, in order to study the atom–atom contacts, Arpeggio server was used

121

for detailed evaluation of TCR-pMHC complex derived from SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Accordingly, protein

122

structure and visualization of the measured interactions between atoms including the strongest mutually

123

exclusive interactions, polar contacts, H-bonds, ionic interactions, aromatic contacts, hydrophobic contacts,

124

and carbonyl interactions were showed by WebGL-based protein structure viewer and PyMOL session

125

based-visualization.

126
127

Peptide-protein flexible docking

128

One of the significant tools for designing of drug is computational docking methods. So, the usage of

129

innovative methods including protein-peptide docking for quick development of peptide therapeutics in

130

rational drug design is unavoidable. In this study, template-based docking and 3D protein-peptide complex

131

structures from input protein structure and peptide sequence were predicted by GalaxyPepDock server

132

(http://galaxy.seoklab.org/cgi-bin/submit.cgi?type=PEPDOCK) through merging information on analogous

133

interactions in the structure database and energy-based optimization in order to expect the formation of

134

MHC-peptide complex. Then, the contacting residues in the template structure to the template amino acids

135

was aligned by similarity of the amino acids of the target complex and an interaction similarity score was

136

defined for it by server. This analysis presented an example of MHC-peptide docking performed by each

137

individual hit peptides derived from N and S proteins and available PDB file of HLA alleles including

138

HLA-A0201 (PDB: 5yxn), HLA-B3501 (PDB: 1a9e), HLA-B0801 (3spv), HLA-B3508 (3bw9), HLA-

139

B4405 (3dx8), and HLA-E (2esv), separately.

Designing of multi-hit peptides vaccine sequence

141

A set of high immunogenic hit peptides derived from N and S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 with high binding

142

events to HLA-A0201, HLA-B0801, HLA-B3501, HLA-B3508, HLA-B4405, and HLA-E were selected

143

on the basis of their solvent exposed residues and hydrophobicity scales. The AAY and GPGPG linkers

144

were applied for linking the candidate N and S hit peptides together, respectively. Additionally, the human

145

beta defensin 3 was also joined at N-terminus of the vaccine construct using EAAAK linker which acts as

146

adjuvant to improve the immunogenicity of the multi-hit peptides vaccine.

147
148

Prediction of allergenicity, antigenicity, and physiochemical properties of designed vaccine

149

The allergenicity of query sequence was evaluated using AllergenFP v.1.0 server (http://ddg-

150

pharmfac.net/AllergenFP/). Vaccine construct was analyzed by VaxiJen v2.0 (http://www.ddg-

151

pharmfac.net/vaxijen/VaxiJen/VaxiJen.html) with high accuracy at 0.4 thresholds for virus. Also,

152

ProtParam web server (https://web.expasy.org/protparam/) was used to predict various physicochemical

153

properties of vaccine construct including like theoretical isoelectric point (pI), in vitro and in vivo half-life,

154

amino acid composition, molecular weight, instability and aliphatic index, and grand average of

155

hydropathicity (GRAVY).

156
157

Vaccine-structure modeling

158

The SOPMA web server (https://npsa-prabi.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/npsa_automat.pl?page=npsa_sopma.html) was

159

utilized for the computation the secondary structure of multi-hit peptides vaccine. Indeed, I-TASSER server

160

(https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/), as an algorithm for fast and accurate de novo protein

161

structure prediction, was further employed to predict the solvent accessibility, 3-dimensional structure (3D),

162

and function of the vaccine sequence. In detail, I-TASSER by recruiting SPICKER program groups all the

163

decoys according to the pair-wise structure similarity and provides five models that are linked to the five

164

largest structure clusters. This server determines the confidence of each model by C-score which typically

165

is in the range of (-5, 2). A model with a higher confidence has higher C-score than a model with a lower

166

confidence. Also, prediction of TM-score and RMSD was done by I-TASSER server according to the C-

167

score and protein length after obvious connection between these qualities.

Refinement of tertiary structure and validation

169

The refinement of the tertiary structure of vaccine was carried out using 3Drefine server

170

(http://sysbio.rnet.missouri.edu/3Drefine/index.html) which is based on the CASP10 tested refinement

171

method for protein's side chain reconstruction, molecular dynamics simulation, and repacking to relax the

172

3D structure. Then, to fulfill the validation of 3D structure, output model of 3Drefine server was subjected to

173

the ProSA-web server (https://prosa.services.came.sbg.ac.at/prosa.php). Overall quality of the model with

174

Z-score index was anticipated for model by the server. The outside range of Z-score value for the predicted

175

model

176

(http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/) also was used to determine the overall quality of the predicted model

Immune simulation

180

To further characterize immune response profile of multiple hit-peptide protein, FASTA format of our

181

multi-hit peptides vaccine was subjected to C-ImmSim server (http://150.146.2.1/C-IMMSIM/index.php)

182

for computing T cell immune response. C-ImmSim is an agent-based model that can predict immune

183

epitope and immune interactions by using PSSM (a position-specific scoring matrix) and machine learning

184

techniques, respectively. It instantaneously induces three compartments in three distinct anatomical regions

185

(bone marrow thymus, a tertiary lymphatic organ). As such, three injections with time steps set at 1, 84, and

186

168 were given four weeks apart along an injection without LPS. Also, host HLA were selected for HLA-

187

A0201, HLA-A0101, HLA-B0801, HLA-B3508, and HLA-DRB1_0101. Nevertheless, the simulation

188

volume and simulation steps were set based on the default parameters.

In our theoretical study, no statistical analyses were performed according to the literature data and web-

192

Results and Discussion

196

Overview of the potential TCR–pMHC binding models for SARS-CoV-2 proteins:

197

According to TCR–pMHC binding models, for N query, one hit peptide antigen candidate

198

(105SPRWYFYYL113) with Z-value cutoff > 4 and 61 homologous peptide antigens in 34 organisms was

199

found by using HLA-A0201-peptide-TCR template [PDB entry 2vlr] and the experimental peptide database.

200

It was documented that E, M, and ORF10 protein queries have two hit peptide antigen candidates (Z-value

201

cutoff > 4). Also, 108, 80, and 40 homologous peptide antigens in 56, 40, and 25 organisms by using HLA-

202

A0201-peptide-TCR template [PDB entry 1qrn, 2jcc, and 1oga] and the experimental peptide database was

203

identified for them, respectively. Giving our data, five and ten hit peptide antigen candidates (Z-value

204

cutoff > 4), and 23 and 40 homologous peptide antigens in 16 and 25 organisms by using HLA-A0201-

205

peptide-TCR template [PDB entry 2p5e and 1oga] and the experimental peptide database were inferred in

206

ORF3a and S proteins, respectively. No hit peptide antigen candidates with Z-value cutoff > 4 were

207

detected for ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF8 queries by using HLA-A0201-peptide-TCR template (Figure S1A).

208

Our results showed that by using HLA-B0801 (Figure S1D), HLA-B3501 (Figure S1B), and HLA-B3508

209

(Figure S1E) template, TCR-pMHC models with Z-value cutoff > 4 were only predicted for S (5 hit peptide

210

antigen candidate and 91 homologous peptide antigens in 57 organisms with PDB entry 1mi5), N (3 hit

211

peptide antigen candidate and 3 homologous peptide antigens in 2 organisms with PDB entry 2nx5), and S

212

(1 hit peptide antigen candidate and 1 homologous peptide antigens in 1 organisms with PDB entry 2ak4)

213

proteins, respectively. While, only M and S proteins were used to predict TCR-pMHC complex by using

214

HLA-B4405 (Figure S1C) with PDB entry 3dxa (15 homologous peptide antigens in 12 organisms). Also

215

only N, ORF10, and S proteins were used for prediction of TCR-pMHC complex by HLA-E (Figure S1F)

216

with PDB entry 2esv (84 homologous peptide antigens in 41 organisms) with Z-value cutoff > 4. No hit

217

peptide antigen candidates with Z-value cutoff > 4 were detected for M, E, and ORF3a queries by using

218

HLA-E-peptide-TCR template (Figure S1F). Moreover, model for ORF1ab query did not predict due to its

219

sequence length was ≥ 300. The 3D structure of the TCR–pMHC complex for each hit peptide derived

220

from each protein was illustrated by SWISS-MODEL. Detailed information about derived hit peptides for

221

SARS-CoV-2 along with bat-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV were tabulated in Table 1.

223

The binding events among hit peptides derived from N proteins related to HLA-A0201

224

Our TCR-pMHC models predicted that position 2 of the homologous peptide antigens (Figure 1A) related

225

to TCR-pMHC complex of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV and bat-CoV N proteins prefers the

226

hydrophobic amino acid residues (e.g. Ile, Leu, Met, and Phe), and the second position of these hit peptides

227

is an hydrophobic amino acid residue Pro forming five strong VDW forces with residues Y99, V67, M45,

228

Y7, and F9 and two H-bonds with residues K66 and E63 on MHC molecule (Figure S2A, left). By contrast,

229

the second position of MERS-CoV N protein-derived hit peptide is charged residue Arg forming three

230

strong VDW forces with residues M45, F9, and V67 and two H-bonds with residues K66 and E63 (As

231

same as SARS-CoV-2) on MHC molecule. Surprisingly, position 9 of all homologous peptides antigens

232

(Figure 1A) prefers the hydrophobic amino acid residues (e.g. Leu, Ile, Val, and Met), and the position 9 of

233

these hit peptides is hydrophobic amino acid residue Leu (in the SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and bat-CoV)

234

and Gly (in the MERS-CoV). Our results showed that Leu attaches to the MHC with three strong VDW

235

forces with residues L81, I124, and W147 and three H-bonds with residues D77, Y84, and T143, while Gly

236

forms three strong VDW forces with residues L81, V95, and W147 and two H-bonds with residues D77

237

and V95 on MHC molecule (Figure S2A, left). Moreover, positions 4, 6, and 8 of hit peptides in SARS-

238

CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and bat-CoV form one H-bond with residues Q52, Q52 and D32 in chain E of TCR,

239

respectively (Figure S2C, left). While, only position 4 of hit peptides in MERS-CoV forms one H-bond

240

with reside S100 in chain D of TCR (Table S1). Visualization of interactions in the atomic level structure

246

SARS-CoV-2, bat-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV prefer the hydrophobic amino acid residues.

247

Accordingly, position 1 of these hit peptides forms two H-bonds with residues Y170 and Y158 and position

248

2 of these hit peptides forms a H-bonds with residue E62 and four strong VDW forces with residues A66,

249

Y6, W96, and M44. Moreover, position 7 of these hit peptides forms a H-bond with residue N76 and three

strong VDW forces with residues L123, F115, and W132. (Figure S2A, center). We identified position 4 of

hit peptides lacks any contacts, although the position 5 and 6 of hit peptides form both H-bonds and/or

strong VDW forces on both MHC molecule and TCR (Figure S2A and S2C, center) (Table S2).

right). Also, position 2 of the homologous peptide antigens in SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and bat-CoV

263

prefers the hydrophobic amino acid residues (e.g. Pro, Ala, and Ile) and the position 2 of these hit peptides

264

forms three strong VDW contacts with residues Y159, Y7, and Y99 on MHC molecule (Figure S2A, right).

265

Interestingly, based on the binding models and interactions, positions 6, 8, and 9 of all hit peptides

266

correlated with the SARS-CoV-2, bat-CoV, and SARS-CoV lack any H-bonds and strong VDW contact,

267

while the hit peptides of all comparison targets correlate well with the amino acid profile on the conserved

268

positions (i.e. 4 and 7) forming one strong VDW forces and two H-bonds based on the interactions on TCR

(Figure S2C, right) (Table S3). Visualization of interactions in the atomic level structure of a TCR-pMHC

(Figure S2B, left). Also, position 11 is residue Ala forming one strong VDW contacts with residue W147

279

on MHC molecule (Figure S2B, left). We found that the position 10 of hit peptides lacks any H-bond and

280

strong VDW forces, while the positions 5 and 6 of hit peptides in the SARS-CoV-2, bat-CoV, and SARS-

281

CoV form one strong VDW forces on MHC molecule (Figure S2B, left) and two strong VDW forces on

282

TCR (Figure S2D, left). Additionally, position 6 forms one H-bond on TCR (Figure S2D, left) (Table S4).

287

The binding events among hit peptides derived from S proteins related to HLA-B4405

288

Hit peptide derived from SARS-CoV-2 as same as bat-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV correlates well

289

with the amino acid profile on the conserved positions (i.e. 4, 5, 7, and 8) and all of them form one strong

290

VDW forces with residue I66, V152, and A150 based on the interactions of pMHC interfaces in HLA-

291

B4405-peptide-TCR template (3dxa), respectively. In spite of that, position 9 of all queries forms two H-

292

bonds with residue E76 and W147 on MHC (Figure S2B, center) and one strong VDW forces and two H-

293

bonds on TCR (Figure S2D, center). Based on the interactions of hit peptides with TCR, position 4, 5, and

294

7 form one, three, and two strong VDW forces, receptivity, Also, position 8 of the homologous peptide

295

antigens (Figure 1E) in all queries prefers the hydrophobic amino acid residues (e.g. Val, Ala, and Leu) and

296

the position 8 of these hit peptides (excluding MERS-CoV) is polar amino acid residue Gln forming one

297

strong VDW contacts with residue V152 on MHC molecule (Figure S2B, center). Whereas position 6 of hit

298

peptides attaches to the TCR molecule with two H-bonds (Figure S2D, center) (Table S5). Visualization of

306

in MERS-CoV is hydrophobic amino acid residue Pro forming two strong VDW forces with residues I66

307

and F36, and one H-bond with residue N63 on MHC molecule (Figure S2B, right). Conversely, position 4

308

of the homologous peptide antigens of all queries has no detectable binding to both MHC and TCR.

309

Additionally, position 6 of these hit peptides with a H-bond and strong VDW forces connects to the

310

residues Q96 and Y96 on TCR, respectively (Figure S2D, right). The hit peptide correlates well with the

311

amino acid profile on the conserved positions 7 (Tyr) that forms one strong VDW forces with residue

312

W147 on MHC (Figure S2B, right) and four strong VDW forces with residue A97, H47, H32, and L90 on

313

TCR (Figure S2D, right and Table S6). Visualization of interactions in the atomic level structure of a TCR-

317

Immunogenicity study for SARS-CoV-2 protein derived peptide antigens

318

Prediction the immunogenicity of a class I peptide MHC complex showed that the top putative

319

immunogenic SARS-CoV-2-derived hit peptide candidates related to HLA-A0201 based on their score

320

were 105SPRWYFYYL113 (derived from N protein), 5NVFAFPFTI13 (derived from ORF10 protein),

321

19LFLAFVVFL27 (derived from E protein), and 145YFLCWHTNC153 (derived from ORF3a protein),

322

respectively. Interestingly, the hit peptides derived from N and E proteins of SARS-CoV-2 by using HLA-

323

A0201 were similar to the peptides derived from N and E proteins of bat-CoV and SARS-CoV, and all of

324

them had higher immunogenicity in comparison to hit peptides derived from MERS-CoV N and E proteins.

325

This result generally was consistent with the result of Grifoni et al., who showed that the sequence of

326

protein consensus of SARS-CoV-2 was similar to the protein sequence of SARS-CoV and bat-CoV, but

327

was more different from protein consensus of MERS-CoV [17]. More specifically, our results showed that

328

the hit peptide derived from ORF3a of SARS-CoV-2 was similar to the hit peptide derived from bat-CoV

329

protein 3, and both of them had higher immunogenicity in comparison to hit peptide derived from MERS-

330

CoV and SARS-CoV ORF3 proteins. Our data emphasized the hit peptide derived from SAR-CoV-2 S

331

protein by using HLA-A0201 had lower immunogenicity than bat-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV.

332

Additionally, regarding HLA-E, comparison of SARS-CoV-2 N-derived hit peptide (DLSPRWYFY) to

333

sequences for bat-CoV (ELSPRWYFY), MERS-CoV (QLAPRWYFY), and SARS-CoV (ELSPRWYFY)

334

revealed a high degree of immunogenicity between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and bat-CoV but a more

335

limited immunogenicity with MERS-CoV.

336

Based on the hypothesis that solvent exposed residues via increasing TCR binding can provide appropriate

337

evidence about peptide immunogenicity, we measured solvent exposed area (SEA) for each hit peptide.

338

Our results displayed that the SEA > 30 Å2 for hit peptide related to HLA-B0801, HLA-B3501, and HLA-

339

B3508 were 5.08, 7.76, and 8.28, respectively. Indeed, we found the most solvent accessibility of amino

340

acids were in the hit peptide M (SEA > 30 Å2: 5.99), S (SEA > 30 Å2: 6.75), and ORF10 (SEA > 30 Å2: 6)

341

for HLA-A0201, HLA-B4405, and HLA-E, respectively.

342

Over the past few months, studies in humans are beginning to unravel the underpinnings relationship

343

between hydrophobicity scales and eradication of immune responses. Currently, identification of peptide

344

regions exposed at the surface has gained much attention in the field of immunogenicity of peptides

345

presented by MHC. This concept is reinforced when we investigate the hydrophobic solvent accessible

346

surface area (hSASA) for each peptide. As such, to account for immunogenicity of MHC-presented

347

peptides, we relied on the hydrophobicity of each peptide position. Further, we evaluated whole-residue

348

hydrophobicity scales among all hit peptides by using the Wimley-White whole-residue hydrophobicity

349

scales to examine how structural characteristics could result in enhanced immunogenicity predictions. Our

350

results are supported by those obtained from IEBD, related to HLA-A0201-peptide-TCR templates showed

351

that specific locations with the most pronounced variations at positions 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9 across the peptides

352

derived from N protein were more hydrophobic in the immunogenic dataset than the peptide derived from

353

M protein (Figure 2A). Our result also showed that the hit peptide antigens derived from N protein related

354

to HLA-E-peptide-TCR (Figure 2E) and S protein related to HLA-B4405 peptide-TCR (Figure 2D) had

355

grater hydrophobicity than ORF10 and M proteins due to differences at positions 6 and 9, and 5,

356

respectively. These observations indicate that hit peptide antigens derived from N and S proteins properly

357

contain immunogenic amino acids. Similarly, positions 8, 10, and 11 across the peptides derived from N,

358

positions 1, 4, 6, 7, and 9 across the peptides derived from S, and positions 1, 4, 5, and 12 across the

359

peptides derived from S proteins (by HLA-B3501 (Figure 2B), HLA-B0801 (Figure 2C), and HLA-B3508

360

(Figure 2F) had high score of hydrophobicity based on their amino acid sequence, respectively.

361

In line with our findings, a landmark study by Grifoni et al. has supporting evidence for the detrimental

362

association between the incidence of CD4+ and CD8+ response against the N and S proteins in humans with

363

COVID-19 Disease [3]. Consistent with this, there are evidence suggesting that the S protein of SARS-

364

CoV-2 is a promising option for induction of a protective immunity [18]. Sorting this relation out could

365

enhance our understanding of the role of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the context of T cell immunity. Of note,

366

SARS-CoV-2-derived hit peptide from N and S proteins were selected for further analysis.

367
368

Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2-derived hit peptides sequence conservation

369

Next, we used CLUSTALW and CLC Sequence Viewer (Version 6.7.1) to calculate the percentage identity

370

between SARS-CoV-2-derived hit peptide sequences and bat-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV. We

371

found that HLA-A0201 binding hit peptide of SARS-CoV-2 N protein (Figure 3A) and the SARS-CoV-2 S

372

proteins correlated with HLA-B3508 (Figure 3F) and HLA-B0801 (Figure 3B) were more strongly

373

conserved between bat-CoV and SARS-CoV (100% identity) in comparison with MERS-CoV (77.78%,

374

69.23%, and 22.22% identity, respectively). We also identified that the hit peptide of SARS-CoV-2 N

375

protein correlated to HLA-B3501 (Figure 3E) and HLA-E (Figure 3C) had 45.45% and 77.78% identity

376

with MERS-CoV, and 90.91% and 88.89% with bat-CoV and SARS-CoV, respectively. Correspondingly,

377

HLA-B4405 binding hit peptide of SARS-CoV-2 S protein (Figure 3D) had 25% identity with MERS-CoV,

378

60% identity with bat-CoV, and 70% identity with SARS-CoV, suggesting high sequences similarity

379

between hit peptides derived from N and S proteins of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and bat-CoV compared

380

to MERS-CoV.

381
382

Assessment of residues interactions

383

It has long been known that a potent immune response to hit peptides is mediated by the higher affinity and

384

binding of the hit peptides to immune cells under optimal conformation. Better understanding of specific

385

macromolecular interactions within the binding sites could help identifying molecular recognitions such as

386

those occurringamong targets and ligands, which are important for drug development. This knowledge is

387

expected to open new application avenues for the designing ofeffective vaccines based on high prioritized

388

epitopes that have strong affinity and binding to TCR and MHC. Different SARS-CoV-2-derived hit

389

peptides with immunogenicity prediction displayed that the maximum binding rate of chain C (hit peptide)

390

in TCR-pMHC complex was linked to the N and S proteins, respectively. Apart from MERS-CoV, when

391

we compared the hydrophobic contacts, mutually exclusive interactions, and polar contacts among different

392

hit peptides by using HLA-A0201- (Figure S4A), HLA-B0801- (Figure S4B), HLA-B3508- (Figure S4D),

393

and HLA-E-peptide-TCR template (Figure S4F), it was proved that these interactions were equal in chain C

394

of TCR-pMHC complex associated with N and S proteins of SARS-CoV-2, bat-CoV, and SARS-CoV

395

proteins. The above-mentioned interactions were lower in SARS-CoV-2 than bat-CoV and SARS-CoV

396

associated with HLA-B3501 (Figure S4C) similarly to the hydrophobic contacts by using HLA-E (Figure

397

S4F). By contrast, the number of aforementioned contents (excluding mutually exclusive interactions in

398

SARS-CoV by using HLA-B4405 (Figure S4E)) was higher in SARS-CoV-2 than bat-CoV and SARS-

399

CoV associated with HLA-B3508 (Figure S4D) as well as the number of polar contacts by HLA-E (Figure

400

S4F). Correspondingly, in HLA-E, SARS-CoV-2-derived hit peptide had the lower mutually exclusive

401

interactions compared to the bat-CoV and SARS-CoV. On the opposite side, this type of interatomic forces

402

was higher in the SARS-CoV-2-derived hit peptide than MERS-CoV associated with HLA-E (Figure S4F,

403

Table 2, and Table S7-S9).

404
405

Peptide-protein flexible Docking

406

For various kinds of biological applications such as vaccine design, peptides have been introduced as

407

potential candidates. Recently, several methods have been introduced for protein-peptide docking, which

408

can estimate the structure of the protein-peptide complex through peptide sequence and protein structure.

409

Accordingly, for hit peptides derived from N protein, NSSPDDQIGYY had the highest interaction

410

similarity score with HLA-B3501 than SPRWYFYYL and DLSPRWYFY with HLA-A0201 and HLA-E,

411

respectively. Moreover, for hit peptides derived from S protein, FSTFKCYGV had the highest interaction

412

similarity score with HLA-B0801 than LQDVVNQNAQALN and NKKFLPFQQF with HLA-B3508 and

413

HLA-B4405, respectively. Figure 4 represents a sample of successful docking model between each hit

414

peptide and its MHC protein.

417

On the basis of immunogenicity and hydrophobicity scale, and residues interactions, six hit peptides

418

derived from N and S proteins related to HLA-A0201, HLA-B0801, HLA-B3501, HLA-B3508, HLA-

419

B4405, and HLA-E including SPRWYFYYL, FSTFKCYGV, NSSPDDQIGYY, LQDVVNQNAQALN,

420

NKKFLPFQQF, and DLSPRWYFY were joined together by linking the N and S hit peptides via AAY and

421

GPGPG linkers. Additionally, the human beta defensin 3 was also attached to the N-terminus of the

422

finalized vaccine construct using EAAAK linker which acts as adjuvant to improve the immunogenicity of

423

the vaccine. Evaluation of the final vaccine construct amino acid sequences (comprising a length of 122

424

amino acids) by BLASTp showed only 36% similarity which is due to the human β-defensin 3 sequence,

425

proving this vaccine did not have any overlap with human proteins and could not elicit autoimmunity.

426

Assessment the secondary structural of the vaccine using SOPMA server uncovered that it was composed

427

of 17.21 % Alpha helix (Hh), 24.59 % Extended strand (Ee), 3.28 % Beta turn (Tt), and 54.92 % Random

428

coil (Cc). The allergenicity and antigenicity of the finalized vaccine construct showed that the vaccine is

429

non-allergenic and it has the antigenicity likelihood of 0.4838 with threshold of 0.4, characterizing the

430

antigenic nature of our final multi-hit peptides vaccine for an adequate inducing of immune response. The

431

molecular weight of vaccine construct and Theoretical protrusion index (pI) score was found to be

432

13498.44 Da and 9.51 while the total numbers of negative and positive charge residues were 7 and 18

433

respectively, confirming vaccine tendency to be antigenicity and its slightly acidic nature. Indeed, the

434

estimated half-life was 30 hours (mammalian reticulocytes, in vitro), > 20 hours (yeast, in vivo), and >10

435

hours (Escherichia coli, in vivo). The extinction coefficient was estimated to be 19285 M-1 cm-1, at 280 nm

436

measured in water, assuming all pairs of cysteine residues form cystines. The instability index (II) was

437

computed to be 47.60, showing unstable nature of vaccine in the experimental setup. Aliphatic index was

438

calculated as 56.8 while Grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) was calculated -0.593.

439
440

Tertiary structure, refinement, and epitope mapping

441

The three-dimensional (3D) structures supply vital insights into the tertiary structure and position of the hit

442

peptides [19]. In the first step, the 3D structure of the multi-hit peptides vaccine with total 122 amino acid

443

residues were modeled by using the I-TASSER web tool (Figure 5A) Accordingly, 5 final models were

17

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.12.294413; this version posted September 12, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

444

predicted as a single domain without disorder. Among them, the first model had a better quality in most

445

cases with C-score = -3.25, Estimated TM-score = 0.35±0.12, and Estimated RMSD = 11.7±4.5Å.

446

However, because of the modelling errors and unavailability of an appropriate template such as angles and

447

irregular bonds, generation of the 3D models cannot be sufficient to follow the necessary accuracy level for

448

some biological purpose, especially where experimental data is rare. As such, for modification of local

449

errors, helping to bring 3D model of vaccine closer to native structures, and growing the accuracy of

450

primary 3D model, the refinement of 3D structure of the vaccine is vital, particularly for furthering in-silico

451

studies [20]. Therefore, the refinement of the model was performed by using 3Drefine tool. On the basis of

452

the overall quality of the refined model, the model 5 exhibited the best results with RMSD 0.549Å (Figure

453

5B). The quality of the best model of the multi-hit peptides vaccine construct was validated by ProSA-web.

454

It is well-known that the Z score is in relation with the length of the protein, indicating that negative Z-

455

scores are more appropriate for a trustworthy model. In fact, the Z score shows the overall quality and

456

calculates the deviation of the total energy related to the protein structure [21]. The Z score of the protein

457

under study was displayed in the plot with a dark black point. Accordingly, our results revealed the

458

improvement of the refined model of vaccine (Z score: -3.81) (Figure 5D) in comparison with initial model

459

(Z score: 3.45) (Figure 5C), which was lying inside the scores range of the native proteins of similar size

460

(range −20 to 10) and also was located within the space of protein related to X-ray, suggesting that the

461

obtained model is reliable and closes to experimentally determined structure. Evaluation the overall quality

462

of the finalized model of vaccine construct by Ramachandran plot analysis emphasized that 77.5% (93/120)

463

of all residues in finalized model (Figure 5F) compared to 54.2% (65/120) of all residues in initial model

464

(Figure 5E) were in favored (98%) regions, also, 90.0% (108/120) of all residues in finalized model (Figure

465

5F) compared to 78.3% (94/120) of all residues in initial model (Figure 5E) were in allowed (>99.8%)

466

regions. After that, protein structure and visualization of the measured interactions between atoms

467

including the strongest mutually exclusive interactions, polar contacts, H-bonds, ionic interactions,

468

aromatic contacts, hydrophobic contacts, and carbonyl interactions were compared together and analyzed

469

by Arpeggio server and finally the results were tabulated in Table 3.

472

C-ImmSim Immune simulator web server was used for determining ability of vaccine to induce T cell

473

immunity. This server yielded results consistent with actual immune responses as evidenced by a general

474

marked increase in the generation of secondary responses. For better following the effects of the final

475

vaccine construct for stimulation of T cell immunity, a construct with point mutations on key residues,

476

replacing of the hydrophobic amino acids with charged amino acids was constructed (Figure 6A).

477

According to data, after vaccination with native vaccine, there was a consistent rise in Th (helper) cell

478

population with memory development compared to control (Figure 6B-E). Interestingly, immune

479

simulation results demonstrated that while a notable activation of TC (cytotoxic) was observed after

480

vaccination with native vaccine, an activation was not observed after vaccination with the mutant vaccine,

481

proving effectiveness of the native vaccine construct for induction of T cell immune response. (Figure 6F

482

and G). The results definitely showed that the T cell population was highly responsive as the memory

483

response developed.

Conclusion

486

To our best knowledge, from the standpoint of immunoinformatics approaches, the concept discussed in

487

this study is the first structural modeling to investigate both the TCR and pMHC interfaces for the SARS-

488

CoV-2 proteins. Our results provide a blueprint for inferring the SARS-CoV-2-derived hit peptides with

489

high accuracy towards vaccine development. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the aforementioned

490

models will offer valuable framework for identifying specific peptides with a potential to acrivate T cell-

491

mediated immune responses to target SARS-CoV-2. As a proof of concept, our study denotes a landmark

492

in the advancement of immunoinformatics based method for designing a multi-hit peptides vaccine against

493

the S and N protein of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, our innovative vaccine candidates can serve as promising

494

tools towards fighting SARS-CoV-2 infections. Further in vitro and in vivo validation studies are necessary

495

to confirm the safety and efficacy of T-cell-based immunotherapies using our vaccine proposed SARS-

496

CoV-2 peptides.

Estimated TM-score = 0.35±0.12, and Estimated RMSD = 11.7±4.5Å (C-score shows the confidence of

597

model, Estimated TM-score and RMSD are based on C-score and protein length following the correlation

598

discovered between these qualities), then the best proposed model was refined by 3Drefine. On the basis of

599

the overall quality of the refined model, the model 5 exhibited the best results with RMSD 0.549 Å. Higher
