Abstract
Early in the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic concerns were raised regarding infection of other animal

hosts and whether these could play a significant role in the viral epidemiology. Infection of animals

could be detrimental by causing clinical disease but also of concern if they become a viral reservoir

allowing further mutations, plus having the potential to infect other animals or humans. The first

reported animals to be infected both under experimental conditions and from anecdotal field

evidence were cats described in China early in 2020. Given the concerns this finding raised and the

close contacts between humans and cats, we aimed to determine whether a vaccine candidate could

be developed that was suitable for use in multiple susceptible animal species and whether this

vaccine could reduce infection of cats in addition to preventing spread to other cats.

Here we report that a Replicon Particle (RP) vaccine based on Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus

(VEEV), known to be safe and efficacious for use in a variety of animals, expressing a stabilised Spike

antigen, could induce neutralising antibody titers in guinea pigs and cats. After two intramuscular

vaccinations, virus neutralising antibodies were detected in the respiratory tract of the guinea pigs

and a cell mediated immune response was induced. The design of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen was

shown to be critical in developing a strong neutralising antibody response. Vaccination of cats was

able to induce a serum neutralising antibody response which lasted for the course of the

experiment. Interestingly, in contrast to control animals, infectious virus could not be detected in

oropharyngeal or nasal swabs of vaccinated cats after challenge. Moreover, the challenged control

cats spread the virus to in-contact cats whereas the vaccinated cats did not transmit virus. The

results show that the RP vaccine induces sterile immunity preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and

transmission. This data suggests that this RP vaccine could be a multi-species vaccine useful for

preventing spread to and between other animals should that approach be required.

Introduction
SARS-CoV-2 is an extremely contagious respiratory coronavirus that emerged in China in late 2019

and has since spread globally causing the on-going coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

Coronaviruses are enveloped, single stranded, non-segmented, positive sense RNA viruses that

encode sixteen non-structural proteins and four structural proteins. The structural Spike protein
is the major determinant of host cell tropism by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) on cells, a type I integral membrane protein that plays an important role in human vascular

health. Using the ACE2 receptor to gain entry to cells in the upper respiratory tract (URT) SARS-CoV-

2 infection of humans has manifested itself in a wide range of clinical outcomes from asymptomatic

to very severe respiratory infections which in some situations are complicated by immunological

dysfunction causing COVID-19 with over 2.7 million fatalities to date. As ACE2 receptors that are

highly similar to the human receptor are also present on the cells of a number of other animals it is

important to understand whether those potential hosts can play any role in disease spread. Since

the first human infections it has been shown that cats, dogs, ferrets, hamsters and mink can be

readily infected either in laboratory studies or via natural transmission [1–5]. The role these

susceptible animals play in the human epidemiology is unclear though two-way transmission

between mink and humans has been demonstrated leading to the culling of all animals in mink farms

[3]. It is therefore of upmost importance to understand the role of animals in the spread of this virus,

especially with regard to their potential to act as a viral reservoir, and the possibility to develop

important viral variants which thereby influence the overall epidemiology.

The importance of cats in the epidemiology of COVID-19 has yet to be fully established, though there

are a significant number of reports of cats testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, mostly in association with

human infections in the same household. The first published report demonstrating that cats could

be experimentally infected also showed virus transmission to in-contact cats [1]. Whilst the infected

cats did not demonstrate overt clinical disease, significant respiratory lesions were detected post-

mortem especially in younger cats. In subsequent experimental trials no clinical disease was

observed in challenged cats but prolonged shed of virus and spread to in contact cats was again

detected [4][5]. In addition to these experimental infection studies, there have been numerous

reports of domestic cats testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with less than a quarter showing signs of

disease and no severe presentations as reported in humans [6]. Although a number of these cases

were associated with the presence of a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected owner, this was not always

the case [7] and natural infection between domestic cats has not been ruled out. Serological surveys

of cats in China [7], USA [8], France [9] and Italy [10] have demonstrated that a high proportion of

cats tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, including feral animals with no known history of ownership.

Although concerns regarding feline infections have significantly reduced, the initial reports that a

large number of cats were being abandoned by owners [11] led to key opinion leaders releasing

statements regarding the low risk of human infection from cats [6]. Furthermore, owners testing

positive for SARS-CoV-2 have been advised to distance themselves from their cats in an attempt to

prevent transmission, and SARS-CoV-2 infection of cats is now reportable to the OIE [12]. Recently,

with the rise of new variants, there are also reports that these variants may have altered host

tropism [13] and possibly also different pathogenesis [14]. For these reasons it is important to

further study the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in cats and whether the possibility exists of the feline

population becoming a natural reservoir for the virus.

A large number of human vaccines are now in development against SARS-CoV-2, with more than five

approved for use in various regions globally. The types of vaccine include adjuvanted expressed

SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, adjuvanted whole SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccines, mRNA encoding SARS-CoV-2

Spike, and recombinant viral vector vaccines expressing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein [15]. Early

reports indicate that these vaccines have good safety profiles and have greatly reduced both the

number and severity of infections. Other important considerations for the long term success of these

vaccines include, the immunological correlates of the protection induced, the vaccination scheme

required to induce an appropriate duration of immunity, the cost and production scale of these

vaccines required for the global population and whether any antibody dependent enhancement is

detected as has been seen on rare occasions with other coronavirus vaccine candidates [16]. The use

of coronavirus vaccines in the veterinary industry is well established with a variety of vaccines

against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), bovine coronavirus (BCV), porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus

(PEDV), feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and canine coronavirus (CCV) being used broadly for many

decades. As an interesting parallel to SARS-CoV-2 infection, IBV is transmitted via the respiratory

route initially causing an upper respiratory infection in chickens followed by systemic disease which,

depending on the strain, can involve the kidney, reproductive organs, or intestinal tract. IBV has

evolved into an enormous number of variant strains globally and it is important to note that many

different serotypes of IBV are present [17]. These serotypes are sufficiently antigenically distinct that

most require unique serotype specific vaccines to control disease.

The licensure of IBV vaccines requires not only the demonstration of protection from clinical disease

but also a highly significant reduction of virus replication in the trachea. Given its respiratory route

of transmission and the requirements to significantly reduce virus present in the respiratory tract,

the most effective vaccines are live attenuated viruses which are delivered by mucosal application,

by spray or in drinking water. Local delivery of live attenuated IBV vaccines induces relatively short-

lived local mucosal IgA neutralising antibody responses in addition to systemic IgA and IgG antibody

responses [18–20]. However, the complete mechanism of protection is unclear and is likely to

involve cell mediated immunity specific for other proteins besides Spike. In longer lived birds,

responses are boosted by the parenteral delivery of adjuvanted inactivated whole virus vaccines

which extends the duration of immunity significantly and is likely to boost the immune response that

has been primed by the mucosally delivered vaccine. Interestingly the induction of virus neutralising

serological antibodies against the Spike protein by parenteral vaccination routes has previously been

shown to provide a low level of protection against respiratory IBV challenge [21–23]. It is therefore

of particular interest to determine how well the human SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates, most of

which are designed to be administered parenterally, are able to control upper respiratory tract

infection and virus spread, in addition to preventing clinical disease. Initial indications are that these

vaccines are successfully reducing human to human spread though the mechanisms involved require

further investigation.

In the controlled experiments in felines it has been shown that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can readily

infect cats and although in most cases no or only a mild disease was detected, the cats can shed the

virus for prolonged periods infecting other cats [4]. Prevention or limitation of virus replication in

infected cats, and thereby reducing direct contact transmission in cats, would be useful in limiting

the establishment of a reservoir in the feline population and also potentially limit the development

or selection of viral mutants in these species. In order to investigate prevention of transmission

between cats we tested whether a vaccine could protect cats from SARS-CoV-2 challenge and also

prevent virus spread between cats under controlled conditions.

For this purpose, we utilised an Alphavirus based Replicon technology derived from the attenuated

TC-83 strain of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) to express the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein.

Replicon technology has been tested in numerous species (including humans) [24,25] and this VEEV

based replicon has been shown to be safe in cats reducing the clinical effects and shed of Feline

Calicivirus which causes an acute respiratory tract infection (Authors unpublished observations).

Furthermore, good responses have been detected in chickens, dogs, horses, pigs and cattle with a

variety of antigen targets [24]. The replicon forms the basis of the Sequivity® RNA Particle vaccine

platform which is currently licensed in the US for multiple swine applications. In this system the

foreign gene of interest, in this case SARS-CoV-2 Spike, is inserted in place of VEEV structural genes

generating a self-amplifying RNA capable of expressing the gene of interest upon introduction into

cells. The self-amplifying replicon RNA directs the translation of large amounts of protein in

transfected cells, reaching levels as high as 15–20% of total cell protein [26]. As the replicon RNA

does not contain any of the VEEV structural genes, the RNA is propagation-defective. The replicon

RNA can be packaged into replicon particles (RP) by supplying the VEEV structural genes in trans in

the form of promoterless capsid and glycoprotein helper RNAs and, when the helper and replicon

RNAs are combined and co-transfected into cells, the replicon RNA is efficiently packaged into single-

cycle, propagation-defective RP which are used in the vaccine formulation [27]. RP vaccines have

been shown to induce both innate and adaptive immune responses including virus neutralising

antibodies and T cell responses [24]. Of significant importance is that this system can be employed

very rapidly with materials sufficient availability for deployment of vaccine within weeks.

The structural conformation and localisation of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein has been found to be

important for induction of a protective immune response [28–30]. We therefore generated two RP

vaccine candidates producing either the wildtype Spike antigen (Spike

protein antigen (Spike

Opt

WT

) or an optimised Spike

). These candidate vaccines were assessed for Spike protein expression and

stability in vitro, and then for the induction of a mucosal and serological antibody response and T cell

stimulation following subcutaneous vaccination of guinea pigs. Following these experiments, the

vaccine demonstrating the most optimal characteristics was tested by subcutaneous vaccination for

the induction of a serological response in cats followed by a mucosal SARS-CoV-2 challenge and

monitoring for clinical signs, shed of virus orally or nasally and transmission to in-contact non-

vaccinated cats.

DNA and helper DNA plasmids were linearized with NotI restriction enzyme prior to in vitro

transcription using RiboMAX™ Express T7 RNA polymerase and cap analog (Promega, Madison, WI).

Importantly, the helper RNAs used in the production lack the VEE subgenomic promoter sequence,

as previously described [27]. Purified RNA for the replicon and helper components were combined

and mixed with a suspension of Vero cells, electroporated in 4 mm cuvettes, and returned to serum-

free culture media. Following overnight incubation, alphavirus RNA replicon particles were purified

from the cells and media by passing the suspension through a depth filter, washing with phosphate

buffered saline containing 5% sucrose (w/v), and finally eluting the retained RP with 400 mM NaCl +

5% sucrose (w/v) buffer or 200 mM Na2SO4 + 5% sucrose (w/v) buffer. Eluted RP were passed
through a 0.22 micron membrane filter and dispensed into aliquots for storage prior to assay and

lyophilisation. A control vaccine was also prepared expressing green fluorescent protein.

The titers of functional RP-Spike vaccines were determined by immunofluorescence assay on

infected Vero cell monolayers following lyophilisation in a stabiliser containing sucrose, NZ Amine

and DMEM and storage at 2-8°C. Briefly, the vaccine was serially diluted and added to a Vero cell

monolayer culture in 96-well plates and incubated at 37°C for 18-24 hours. After incubation, the cells

were fixed and stained with the primary antibody (anti-VEEV nsp2 monoclonal antibody) followed by

a FITC conjugated anti-murine IgG secondary antibody. RNA particles were quantified by counting all

positive, fluorescent stained cells in 2 wells per dilution using the Biotek® Cytation™ 5 Imaging

Reader.

Placebo control vaccine

The placebo vaccine consisted of RNA Particles expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP)

assayed, lyophilized and stored at 2-8°C as described above. Following use, each of the test vaccines

were titrated to confirm the vaccination dose.

SPF guinea pigs with a minimum weight of 350 grams were randomly divided over the non-

WT

vaccinated control group, RP-Spike

Opt

vaccine group, and RP-Spike

vaccine group (n=6 per group).

One week after placement, animals remained either non-vaccinated or received a prime vaccination

7

of 1 x 10

RP dose intramuscularly (0.1 ml in each leg muscle). Three weeks after prime vaccination

animals received a booster vaccination of 1 x 10

7

RP dose intramuscular (0.1 ml in each leg muscle).

Six weeks after the booster vaccination animals received a second booster vaccination and 7 days

later animals were sacrificed. Terminal blood was taken for LST and trachea were carefully dissected

without causing bleedings. Mucus was taken from the inside of the trachea using a swab, taken up in

1 ml of phosphate buffered saline and used to determine mucosal antibody titers. At the day of

booster vaccination, and with 2-week interval until 6 weeks after boost vaccination, clotted blood

was taken using cardiac-puncture and serum was used to determine systemic antibody titers.

Surrogate VN assay Guinea pig sera

The SARS-CoV-2 Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test Kit from GenScript (REF: L00847) was used

according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, sera were diluted in sample dilution buffer, mixed

1:1 with HRP-RBD, and incubated 30 minutes at 37°C. Next, samples were put in a 96-well plate

containing ACE2 receptor coated on the surface and incubated 15 minutes at 37°C. Unbound HRP-

RBD was washed away and remaining HRP was visualized using TMB substrate and measured at

OD450.

ELISA for estimating anti RBD and SED antibody titers in sera

Purified SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SED (Spike ectodomain) were diluted in DPBS (without Ca and Mg,

Lonza, 17-512F) and coated onto 96-well plates (MaxiSorp - ThermoFisher or High binding - Greiner

Bio-one ) using 10nM (10 pmols/mL), and incubated overnight at 4⁰C. Next morning plates were

washed with an ELISA plate washer (ImmunoWash 1575, BioRad) using 0.25 mL wash solution/well

(DPBS, 0.05% Tween 20) three times, then blocked with 250 µL blocking solution (5% milk - Protifar,

Nutricia, 0.1% Tween 20 in DPBS) for 2 hours at RT (room temperature). Afterwards the blocking

solution was discarded, 4-fold serial dilutions of the sera (prepared in blocking solution, in duplicates

or triplicates) were added to the corresponding wells and incubated for 1h at RT. Each plate

contained positive control (guinea pig sera diluted to obtain an OD450 of ~2) and negative control

wells. Plates were washed again 3 times before being incubated with the HRP-containing antibody –

Goat anti-Guinea pig (IgG-HRPO, Jackson Lab 106-035-003, 1:8000) for 1 hour at RT. The last wash

steps were performed, followed by incubation for 10 minutes at RT with 100 µL/well Super Sensitive

TMB (Surmodics, TMBS-1000-01). Reactions were stopped by adding 100 µL/well of 12.5% H2SO4

(Millipore, 1.00716.1000). Absorbance at 450 nm was measured within 30 minutes with an ELx808

Biotek plate reader.

T-cell stimulation test (LST)

Blood was collected and lymphocytes were isolated using Sepmate tube (Stemcell) containing

Histopaque 1083 according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, K3-EDTA blood was diluted 1:2 in

RPMI-1640 medium and pelleted for 10 minutes at 1.200 x g. Cells in the top layer of the tubes were

collected, put in a clean tube containing RPMI-1640 and pellet for 7 minutes at 400 x g. Cells were

washed once with RPMI-1640 medium and pelleted for 7 minutes at 400 x g. Cell concentrations

were counted and 1 x 10

cells were stained with CFSE for 20 minutes at 37°C. Cells were washed

once with RPMI-1640 and from each animal 5 x 10

5

cells were stimulated with either medium, ConA

(10 µg/ml), or purified SARS-CoV-2 S1 antigen (5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.62, 0.31, or 0.15 µg/ml) in duplicate.

Three days after stimulation, cell proliferation was measured using the FACS-Verse.

SARS-CoV-2 challenge virus and cell culture

SARS-CoV-2 strain USA-WA1/2020 (GenBank: QHO60594.1 ) was isolated from an oropharyngeal

swab from a patient with a respiratory illness who had returned from travel to an affected region of

China and developed clinical disease (COVID-19) in January 2020 in Washington, USA. The virus was

propagated for one passage on Vero cells. To determine the virus titer, serial dilutions of virus were

made on Vero cells and plaque forming units quantified by counterstaining with a secondary overlay

containing Neutral Red at 24 hours and visualization after 48 hours of incubation.

Feline Serology

Serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 were studied using an in-vitro plaque reduction neutralisation

test (PRNT). Briefly serum was inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes, serial dilutions of cat serum were

prepared and incubated with 100 pfu of SARS-CoV-2 for one hour at 37°C. The virus serum mixtures

were then plated onto Vero cells and the number of plaques read by counterstaining with a

secondary overlay containing Neutral Red at 24 hours and visualization after 48 hours. Antibody

titers were determined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution in which ≥90% of virus was

neutralised.

receiving the same dose of RP-gfp. After three weeks each group received the same treatment.

Twenty-five days following the second vaccination the cats were challenged as previously described

[4] though using both the intranasal and oral routes with 3.1 x 10

pfu of SARS-CoV-2 under light

sedation. A further two groups of five SPF cats that were neither vaccinated nor challenged were

used as sentinels by co-housing with each group 1 day post-challenge. All animals were observed

daily for 10 days following challenge for clinical signs indicative of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Clinical signs

checked included depression, dyspnea, nasal discharge, ocular discharge, cough, conjunctivitis,

and/or sneezing. Body temperatures were recorded on study days 1-11 post-challenge/post-

mingling.

Oropharyngeal swabs

Oropharyngeal swabs for virus isolation were collected from the challenged cats on study days 1 to 7

post-challenge, the swabs were placed in Tris-buffered MEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin

containing gentamycin, penicillin, streptomycin and amphotericin B (BA-1 media). To assess contact

spread swabs were also collected from the contact sentinels into transport media on study days 2-8

post-challenge. The samples were frozen at -50°C until testing.

Nasal washes

Nasal wash samples for virus isolation were collected days 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 post-challenge as

previously described [4] by instilling 1 ml of BA-1 media into the nares of cats and collecting nasal

discharge in a petri dish. To assess contact nasal washes were also collected from the contact

sentinels on days 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 post-challenge. The samples were frozen at -50°C until testing.

Blood samples

Blood samples were taken for sera prior to and 3 weeks post primary vaccination. In addition, blood

samples were taken prior to and 14 days post challenge.

Virus re-isolation

All oropharyngeal swabs and nasal washes were tested for virus re-isolation as previously described

[4]. Confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells in 6 well plates were washed once with PBS and seeded

with 100ul of serial ten-fold dilutions of swab/wash samples, incubated at 37°C for one hour then

overlaid with 0.5% agarose in MEM containing 2% FBS. A second overlay containing neutral red dye

was added 24 hours later and plaques counted at 48 hours. Viral titers were recorded as log10
pfu/ml.

Results
SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen design

The recent SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efforts have unambiguously shown that stabilizing the pre-fusion

form of the Spike protein enhances immunogenicity of the antigen in the mRNA and vector-based

vaccines [33]. Also, we have shown for the IBV Spike protein that replacing the transmembrane (TM)

and C-terminal domain (CTD) for its counterparts of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein

enhanced cell-surface localization in vitro and immunogenicity in vivo (Authors unpublished

Opt

observations). Therefore, we designed an optimized Spike antigen (Spike

) comprising an

inactivated furin cleavage site (FCS) as well as the introduction of the double-proline (2P)

substitution to stabilize the pre-fusion conformation of the antigen. Additionally, the TM and CTD of

SARS-CoV-2 Spike has been replaced by the similar domains of the VSV glycoprotein (Figure 1).

Immunogenicity study of RP-Spike vaccine candidates in guinea pigs

Immunogenicity of the Spike

antigens was assessed in a guinea pig model in which the

VEEV RP vector vaccines were given intramuscularly (Figure 2A). After prime vaccination all animals

showed seroconversion as assessed by a commercially available surrogate VN test that measures

antibody titers interfering with Spike-receptor binding. Clearly higher surrogate VN titers were

induced by the Spike

antigen compared to the Spike

antigen (Figure 2B). These titers were

boosted after the second vaccination with high titers until the end of the experiment. Consistently,

the titers induced by Spike

antigen were higher in comparison to the RP vaccine producing the

antigen (Figures 2C-D).

The VEEV RP vector platform is known for its efficient induction of both humoral as well as cellular

responses [24]. To assess the level of cellular responses induced by the RP vaccine candidates, a

titers. In contrast to the differences in humoral responses between the Spike

and Spike

antigens, no differences were observed in levels of SARS-CoV-2 S1 specific T-cell differentiation

(Figure 2E). To determine whether the humoral responses also resulted in mucosal immunity,

tracheal swabs were taken at the end of the experiments. Interestingly, also surrogate VN titers

were detected in the trachea swabs, and the levels correlated with the systemic antibody levels with

Opt

superior titers for the Spike

antigen compared to the Spike

WT

antigen (Figure 2F). These antibody

titers suggest that parental vaccination could induce protective mucosal immunity.

Cat vaccination-challenge study

To determine vaccine efficacy, cats were either vaccinated with a RP vaccine producing EGFP

(Control), the optimized SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen (Spike

Opt

) or remained non-vaccinated (sentinels).

Three weeks post booster vaccination, cats were exposed to a mucosal SARS-CoV-2 challenge and

samples were taken as outlined in Figure 3A.

Following vaccination, no adverse reactions were detected in any of the cats at any timepoint. The

Opt

RP vaccine producing the Spike

antigen was able to induce a virus neutralising antibody titer in all

cats after a single vaccination, which was boosted after the second vaccination and maintained

levels until the challenge 3.5 weeks later (Figure 3B). Control and non-vaccinated sentinel animals

remained negative at all times up until challenge. Both the challenged and sentinel cats did not

demonstrate any clinical signs post challenge. However, nine out of ten control challenged cats shed

virus orally (Figure 3D) and nasally (Figure 3E) one day after challenge and for at least 3 days during

the observation period. These data show that the mucosal SARS-CoV-2 challenge results in efficient

virus replication in the respiratory tract. Higher and more consistent virus shed was detected from

the nasal washes whereas the oropharyngeal swabs demonstrated a less consistent pattern, the

reason for this is unknown. Interestingly, virus shed was also detected from the nasal washes in two

of the non-vaccinated sentinels placed with the control animals one day after challenge. Moreover,

all five sentinel animals shed virus via the oral route for at least two days demonstrating efficient

spread of the virus from control challenged to sentinel animals (Figure 3D).

None of the vaccinated cats shed any detectable virus orally (Figure 3D) or nasally (Figure 3E) at any

timepoint after the challenge. The results suggest that the vaccine may have prevented infection.

Also, no virus was detected in the non-vaccinated sentinels housed with the vaccinated cats as

would be expected considering the lack of challenge virus replication in the vaccinated cats. Analysis

of virus neutralising antibody titers post challenge confirmed the findings that both control

challenged and sentinel animals were efficiently infected (Figure 3C). In contrast, no seroconversion

was observed in the sentinel animals housed with the vaccinated cats. Thus, the VEEV RP vaccine

producing the Spike

Discussion
With the ongoing pandemic and reports of naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 infections of a variety of

animal species, it is important to understand the epidemiology of this virus in these animal

populations especially with regards to the establishment of potential reservoirs, mutations and

transmission within and to other species. SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans can be transmitted to

cats and it has been hypothesised that cat to cat transmission of virus can take place in a natural

setting [1]. It was previously demonstrated that SARS-CoV could infect and spread between cats [22]

but the complete epidemiological picture of feline infection was not fully understood with the rapid

eradication of SARS-CoV from humans before it reached a pandemic situation. The situation with

SARS-CoV-2 is different as it has become a global issue with the likelihood of becoming endemic in

the human population. Whilst an infected cat is considered to be low risk for SARS-CoV-2

transmission to humans, to other cats and other species, the fact that infected cats shed virus for

prolonged periods which can potentially be aerosolised gives credence to the possibility that cats

may play some role in the viral epidemiology either by transmitting the virus onwards, enabling

further mutation, or acting as a virus reservoir. Although routine vaccination of cats is not proposed,

should the epidemiological situation change, the availability of a vaccine which can be rapidly

produced, updated, and which reduces or prevents viral replication and transmission between cats

and other animals will be useful. Furthermore, a vaccine that could be used in a range of susceptible

animal species would be preferable.

We have demonstrated that optimal expression of coronavirus Spike antigens is critical to the

induction of a sustained neutralising antibody response in both guinea pigs and cats. In the guinea

pig experiments it was interesting to note that intramuscular vaccination induced some level of

mucosal antibody titers, which was somewhat surprising and is likely to be a wash over from

serological induction. It remains to be established whether these antibodies might contribute to the

sterile immunity that has been observed for this vaccine candidate in cats.

The optimised Spike RP vaccine successfully induced a virus neutralising antibody response in all

vaccinated cats after a single vaccination which was boosted upon second vaccination. Furthermore,

the vaccine was able to prevent infection in all vaccinated cats as demonstrated by the lack of virus

re-isolation post challenge. Although there was a strong induction of a serological response in the

cats it was not investigated, as was demonstrated in the guinea pig experiments, whether

neutralising antibody was present in the respiratory tract. Furthermore, we did not examine the role

of cell mediated immunity in the prevention of infection of cats nor were we able to extend the

experiments to investigate the duration of the immune response induced. The ability to induce local

protection from parenterally administered coronavirus vaccines is not well established and in certain

veterinary respiratory coronavirus infections mucosally-applied live attenuated vaccines are used to

reduce the viral replication at the site of initial infection. These live vaccines induce a relatively brief

period of protection, so they are boosted by inactivated adjuvanted whole virus vaccines to establish

longer immunity. Use of inactivated vaccines alone in these veterinary settings is not as effective at

protecting the local respiratory tract as the live priming inactivated boost approach [23]. For this

reason, it is reassuring that a parenterally administered vaccine did appear to provide respiratory

protection in the feline model. Future work would be needed to establish whether a single vaccine

dose would also be sufficient to protect the cats from infection. Furthermore, the optimal

inoculation schedule has not yet been established for this vaccine nor importantly has the duration

of immunity that can be induced and whether the ability to prevent infection and spread persists

over this time.

This work demonstrates the utility of the VEEV strain TC-83-based replicon RNA particle vaccine

platform (Sequivity®). RP vaccines based on VEEV have previously been shown to protect cats

against viral diseases including some respiratory protection against clinical signs and virus shed in a

feline calicivirus infection model, and in addition have been shown to be effective in multiple species

including dogs, horses, pigs, cattle, chickens and ducks [24], authors unpublished observations].

Furthermore, VEEV based RP vaccines expressing the Spike proteins from other coronaviruses have

been shown to induce virus neutralising antibodies [34]. The advantages of RP based technology is

that vaccines can be rapidly prepared if the gene of interest is known to encode a protective antigen.

This vaccine platform is safe-by-design as the RP vaccines undergo a non-productive cycle of

replication in which replicon RNA but no virus is replicated and no adjuvants are required [27].

Thus far Rhesus macaques, hamsters and ferrets have been utilised as natural animal models for

SARS-CoV-2. In these animals, infection is usually asymptomatic or induces mild clinical disease. As

SARS-CoV-2 also induces asymptomatic infections in cats this species may also provide a possibility

to study disease transmission, especially via aerosols and vaccine design aimed at preventing initial

infection in the respiratory tract. In some respects, infection of cats may mimic the majority of

human infections which are asymptomatic.

This work demonstrates that a replicon-based vaccine expressing the stabilised SARS-CoV-2 Spike

protein was able to induce high levels of virus neutralising antibodies in serum of vaccinated cats

and that the induced response was able to prevent infection of the upper respiratory tract thereby

preventing onward transmission to other cats.
