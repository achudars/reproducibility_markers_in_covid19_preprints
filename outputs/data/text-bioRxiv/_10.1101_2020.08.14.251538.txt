Abstract
The COVID-19 outbreak shows a huge variation in prevalence and mortality on geographical level but also
within populations1. The ACE2 gene, identified as the SARS-CoV2 receptor, has been shown to facilitate
the viral invasion and people with higher ACE2 expression generally are more severely affected2, 3. As there
is a lot of variability in ACE2 expression between individuals we hypothesized that differential DNA
methylation profiles could be (one of) the confounding factors explaining this variability. Here we show
that epigenetic profiling of host tissue, especially in the ACE2 promoter region and its homologue ACE1,
may be important risk factors for COVID-19. Our results propose that variable methylation can explain
(part of) the differential susceptibility, symptom severity and death rate for COVID-19. Our findings are a
promising starting point to further evaluate the potential of ACE1/2 methylation and other candidates as
a predictor for clinical outcome upon SARS-CoV2 infection.

Main
Background
In December 2019, a novel human coronavirus now named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) emerged and was responsible for the now global outbreak of potentially
severe and fatal atypical pneumonia defined as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19)1.

As of August 15th, 2020, SARS-CoV2 is responsible for more than 21 million detected COVID-19 cases and
at least 762k deaths worldwide4. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is especially unnerving because
it’s hard to predict how the virus will affect any individual person. As symptoms vary a lot between
infected persons — if they experience them at all — determining if a person is indeed infected by this
novel coronavirus is a surprisingly hard and tricky question to answer without testing5.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that the main symptoms are fever/chills,
headache, muscle pain, fatigue, coughing, sore throat and shortness of breath, which can appear
somewhere between two and 14 days after exposure to the virus6. Confirmed COVID-19 cases have shown
a wide range of reported symptoms, going from mild to severe illness. According to the CDC,
approximately 80% of infected people present few to mild symptoms, while others have a more severe
manifestation of the disease, with extreme cases relying on a ventilator to breathe.

There are a few clear risk factors7, including age and general health status but even within these
subgroups, there is a huge range in severity. It has been shown that next to age and health status, also
socio-economic and environmental factors8, sex9, and even vitamin D status10 are associated with the
immune response and differential susceptibility. Identifying what factors are responsible for the interindividual response to the virus is of utmost importance to aid in the identification of population groups
at higher risk and to guide more effective strategies and protective measurements.

It should be noted that this difference in individual susceptibility is actually not that unusual for infectious
diseases, and thus not unique for COVID-19. The same is true for tuberculosis, malaria and the ‘common’
flu11. The underlying reason, however, is mostly disease-specific due to the fact that the biological
pathways involved in the manifestation of the illness often differ.

Certain genomic variants play a role in the specific immune response to viral infections. The last weeks,
efforts were initiated to look into the role of genetics, and if each person’s unique genetics may affect

their susceptibility and severity to COVID-19. Especially the interplay between the ACE genes and SARSCoV2 has been of great interest.

The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene, which been identified as the SARS-CoV2 receptor, has
been shown to facilitate in the viral invasion2. While most COVID-19 studies currently focus on ACE2, a
Belgian research group very recently released data from 33 European countries where they looked at the
gene coding for angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1)12. Although ACE2 and ACE1 share only 42% of
amino acid identity, they both act as carboxypeptidases to cleave amino acids from the peptides’ carboxyl
terminal. The ACE1 enzyme is characterized by a genetic deletion/insertion (D/I) polymorphism in intron
16, which is associated with alterations in circulating and tissue concentrations of ACE. Their results
demonstrate that prevalence and mortality of COVID-19 infection correlate with the D allele frequency of
the ACE1 D/I polymorphism. Another research group recently has launched a similar hypothesis3.
Interestingly, the D allele has proven to be associated with a reduced expression of ACE23.

It was already known that expression of ACE2 is significantly increased amongst people who smoke or
suffer from diabetes, hypertension, heart diseases and other conditions13, and people with higher ACE2
expression generally seem also more severely affected by SARS-CoV214. Interestingly, this mechanistically
implicated ACE2 gene has been shown to be epigenetically regulated. Taken together with the patient
characteristics for severe COVID-19 outcome this substantiates an essential role for epigenetic regulation.

Results
To explore the importance of ACE2 methylation, publicly available DNA methylation data from 5 research
studies (~1000 samples) was used. All data originated from blood from “healthy” people and methylation
analysis was performed on Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450K) DNA methylation
arrays. As in all Illumina methylation assays, methylation values of each probe are expressed as β values,
which range from 0 (no methylation) to 1 (fully methylated). Raw β values were preprocessed, cleaned
and subsequently normalized. In next step, the 8 probes falling into the ACE2 region were fetched and
visualized. Figure 1 displays for each individual 8 probe the corresponding methylation levels per sample.
The x- and y-axis show each sample’s age and its normalized β value for that position/probe, respectively.
Probes are sorted per genomic position in ACE2 (left to right per row).

Two groups are noticeable: (i) the big cloud of samples marked with circles and a lighter color, and (ii) the
smaller cloud of darker triangles. This latter group represents data from a cohort of centenarians. Of
special interest are the promoter (flanking) regions. Here, TSS200 covers the region from transcription
start site (TSS) to -200 nucleotides upstream; TSS1500 represents the region -200 to -1500 nucleotides
upstream of TSS. Probes falling into these regulatory regions are colored in orange, red and purple

(TSS1500/200 + 1stExon/5’UTR) It is apparent that in general upon aging the average methylation levels
gradually decline while the spread increases. However, when only looking at the group of centenarians
methylation levels appear higher and show a remarkable higher consistency (Table 1).

Figure 1: Chronological age (x-axis) vs normalized β values (y-axis) for 8 methylation probes in ACE2.

Subjects older than 85years (here referred to as ‘centenarians’) are marked with a triangle and a darker color. Probes are
colored as follows: orange=TSS1500; red=TSS200; purple=1stExon and/or 5’UTR; green=Gene Body; blue=3’UTR.

There is a lot of variability in ACE2 expression between individuals and many variants of ACE2 are
associated with medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disorders13. Thus,
it could be that such predisposing genetic variants may also contribute to the susceptibility and explain
the enormous variability in infection rate, symptom development/severity and death rate. But, while
definitely plausible, to date, limited associations have been found between ACE2 variants and response
to SARS-CoV2 infection. As ACE2 plays a role in the SARS-CoV2 infection pathway and ACE2 expression
seems very variable between individuals, differential DNA methylation of ACE2 could be one of the
confounding factors explaining (part of) this variability.

Hoffmann and coworkers showed that in addition to ACE2, SARS-CoV2 infection also depends on the host
cell factor transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), a cellular protease. While ACE2 is used for initial
binding and host cell entry, the spike protein of SARS-CoV2 is primed by TMPRSS2. A process of which the
authors demonstrate can be blocked by a clinically proven protease inhibitor15. The TMPRSS2 gene is
known to be regulated by androgen16. Interestingly, inhibition of the androgen receptor by for example
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) decreases TMPRSS2 levels17 – the same effect as higher (promoter)
methylation – resulting in less viral priming options and thus less viral entry18.

DNA methylation is not static. With age, the methylation state of various genes may change19. It is also
known that general health status and lifestyle has an impact on the methylation signatures. These changes
are quantifiable and serve as a means to determine one’s “epigenetic age” which often differs from the
chronological age20. Epigenetic age is a collection or footprint reflecting a combination of a person’s
genetic make-up but also his/her history of past external experiences/exposures. A compelling example
is the case of super-centenarians (people who live > 100 years old and seem to age very healthy). When
looking at their epigenetic age, it is significantly less than their chronological age. In these supercentenarians, the underlying reason is probably a combination of both genetic predisposition and lifestyle.

Could differential ACE2 promoter methylation in host tissue be causative to the differential expression
that is seen amongst COVID-19 patients? Could variable DNA signatures of ACE2 (and TMPRSS2) explain
(at least part of) the differential susceptibility, symptom development/severity and death rate for COVID19? Here, we hypothesize that epigenetic profiling, especially DNA methylation signatures, may indeed

permit discovery of population-, age- and gender-related risk factors for COVID-19. The more consistent
methylation levels in the centenarian cohort is at least very compelling.

Our findings are a promising starting point to further evaluate the potential of ACE2 and TMPRSS2
methylation as a predictor for clinical outcome upon SARS-CoV2 infection. Note that blood DNA
represents a mixture of DNA from various leucocyte types. However, due to close contact in the alveoli,
methylation patterns found in blood can closely reflect methylation in lung tissue. Other studies focusing
on the effect of smoking on DNA methylation indeed found that the effects in blood samples were very
similar to the changes in lung tissue21, 22. But to prove any association, follow-up research is needed on
respiratory samples from patients. We are now collecting these samples and aim to compare methylation
profiles of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and other interesting candidate genes from both COVID-19 negatives and
positives (with ranging severity/complications). As the virus continues to spread, more mild cases will
arise, and healthcare professionals need to recognize these to accurately portray total numbers of COVID19 infections. Differentiating mild and moderate from severe disease may also help clinicians in more
accurately triaging cases who need medical attention and minimize the risks on the population, health
systems, and economy.

Methods
Methylation was measured on Illumina’s 450K methylation array for which raw data was downloaded
from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)23 (GSE30870, GSE32149, GSE36064, GSE41169, GSE42861).
Details on the individual data sets and characteristics of the study cohort can be found in Table 2 below.
A full description of each dataset can be found in the original reference.

The Illumina 450K BeadChip measures bisulfite-conversion-based, single-CpG resolution DNA methylation
levels for over 480K cytosine sites and covers 96% of CpG islands in the human genome. Unlike the
previous platform (27K BeadChip) the Illumina 450K BeadChip includes two distinct probe types, Infinium
I (n=135,501) and Infinium II (n=350,076). In the Infinium I type, each CpG site is targeted by two 50bp
probes: one for detecting the methylated intensity (M) and one for detecting the unmethylated (U)
intensity, whereas for Infinium II types, both the M and U intensity of each CpG site are detected by one
single probe using different dye colors (green and red). Methylation values per CpG site are indicated by
the β-value which ranges from 0 (no methylation) to 1 (fully methylated) and is computed as
β=M/(M+U+α) where α is 100 generally24.

Raw β-values were preprocessed in R (v3.6.3) with the RnBeads package (v2.4.0)25. Probes not in CpG
context were filtered out as well as probes for which the β values were NA or had low variability (standard
deviation < 0.005). β-values remaining probes were next normalized using the Beta MIxture Quantile

dilation method (BMIQ)26. In BMIQ, the β-values of type II probes are adjusted into a statistical distribution
characteristic of type I probes. After normalization, probes corresponding with ACE2 were fetched and
the β-values of each sample were plotted against the subjects’ respective chronological age.
