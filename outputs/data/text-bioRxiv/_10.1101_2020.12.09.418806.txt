10

Cross-reactive epitopes (CREs) are similar epitopes on viruses that are recognized or neutralized by

11

same antibodies. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2, similar to type I fusion proteins of viruses such as HIV-

12

1 envelope (Env) and influenza hemagglutinin, is heavily glycosylated. Viral Env glycans, though host

13

derived, are distinctly processed and thereby recognized or accommodated during antibody responses.

14

In recent years, highly potent and/or broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (bnAbs) that

15

are generated in chronic HIV-1 infections have been defined. These bnAbs exhibit atypical features

16

such as extensive somatic hypermutations, long complementary determining region (CDR) lengths,

17

tyrosine sulfation and presence of insertions/deletions, enabling them to effectively neutralize diverse

18

HIV-1 viruses despite extensive variations within the core epitopes they recognize. As some of the HIV-

19

1 bnAbs have evolved to recognize the dense viral glycans and cross-reactive epitopes (CREs), we

20

assessed if these bnAbs cross-react with SARS-CoV-2. Several HIV-1 bnAbs showed cross-reactivity

21

with SARS-CoV-2 while one HIV-1 CD4 binding site bnAb, N6, neutralized SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore,

22

neutralizing plasma antibodies of chronically HIV-1 infected children showed cross neutralizing activity

23

against SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, our observations suggest that human monoclonal antibodies

24

tolerating extensive epitope variability can be leveraged to neutralize pathogens with related antigenic

25

profile.

26

Importance

27

In the current ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, neutralizing antibodies have been shown to be a critical

28

feature of recovered patients. HIV-1 bnAbs recognize extensively diverse cross-reactive epitopes and

29

tolerate diversity within their core epitope. Given the unique nature of HIV-1 bnAbs and their ability to

30

recognize and/or accommodate viral glycans, we reasoned that the glycan shield of SARS-CoV-2 spike

31

protein can be targeted by HIV-1 specific bnAbs. Herein, we showed that HIV-1 specific antibodies

32

cross-react and neutralize SARS-CoV-2. Understanding cross-reactive neutralization epitopes of

33

antibodies generated in divergent viral infections will provide key evidence for engineering so called

34

super-antibodies (antibodies that can potently neutralize diverse pathogens with similar antigenic

35

features). Such cross-reactive antibodies can provide a blueprint upon which synthetic variants can be

36

generated in the face of future pandemics.

Introduction

38

Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) targeting the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) can neutralize

39

a broad range of circulating HIV-1 isolates and have been called super-antibodies due to their

40

remarkable potency and neutralization breadth (1). As a result of its extensive genetic diversity, HIV-1

41

is subdivided in multiple clades and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs). A rare subset of HIV-1

42

infected individuals develops broad and potent antibody responses and have served as potential

43

candidates for the isolation of HIV-1 bnAbs (2, 3). HIV-1 bnAbs take years to develop, have atypical

44

features including long complementarity-determining regions (CDR) loops, high levels of somatic

45

hypermutations (SHMs), presence of insertions and/or deletions (indels), tyrosine sulfation, and develop

46

to tolerate significant alterations in their core epitope (1–3). Notably, V2-apex bnAbs have been shown

47

to exhibit cross-group neutralization activity with viruses derived from HIV-1 group M, N, O and P Envs.

48

Furthermore, they even show cross-neutralization of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) isolates (4).

49

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019, rapidly spread

50

across different countries, infecting millions of individuals and has caused a global COVID-19 pandemic

51

(5). The SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike glycoprotein (S) binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)

52

which leads to host cell entry and fusion (6, 7). Type 1 viral fusion machines, including HIV-1 Env,

53

Influenza hemagglutinin (HA), and SARS-CoV-2 S protein, mediate viral entry driven by structural

54

rearrangements and are trimeric in their pre-fusion and post-fusion state (2, 7, 8). SARS-CoV-2 S

55

protein is covered by host-derived glycans on 66 PNGS on each trimer and site-specific glycan analysis

56

has shown that 28% of glycans on the protein surface are underprocessed oligomannose-type glycans

57

(9). SARS-CoV and HCoV OC43 elicited antibodies have been shown to cross-react with SARS-CoV-

58

2. The Neutralizing antibody (nAb), S309, isolated from memory B-cells of a SARS-CoV infected

59

individual targets a glycan epitope conserved within the Sarbecovirus subgenus (10). Several HIV-1

60

bnAbs have been shown to penetrate the glycan shield and contact protein residues in Env via their

61

long complementary determining region (CDR) loops and make stabilizing contacts with the

62

surrounding high mannose and complex glycans (11, 12). Several HIV-1 bnAbs recognize

63

glycopeptides and/or cluster of N-linked glycans (1–3). The glycans on HIV-1 Env are highly dynamic

64

and can be occupied by different glycoforms due to glycan processing. The glycan shield covering the

65

HIV-1 Env comprises roughly half its mass and shields approximately 70% of the protein surface with

66

glycosylation occurring on potential N-linked glycosylation sites that vary significantly between infected

67

individuals (18 – 33 PNGS) (13, 14).

68

Herein, we reasoned that given the unique nature of HIV-1 bnAbs and their ability to recognize and/or

69

accommodate viral glycans, the glycan shield of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can be targeted by HIV-1

70

specific bnAbs.

71

Results and Discussion

72

In the past decade, a large panel of bnAbs and non-nAbs targeting diverse epitopes on the HIV-1 Env

73

glycoprotein have been isolated and extensively characterized (reviewed in refs (1–3)). To evaluate the

74

potential cross-reactivity of these antibodies, we first performed binding ELISA of 30 bnAbs and 7 non-

75

nAbs with SARS-CoV-2 S2Pecto protein (pre-fusion stabilized ectodomain construct, 1 – 1208 amino

76

acid residues) and receptor-binding domain (RBD, residues 319 – 541, also called S1B domain). The

77

HIV-1 bnAbs were categorized into five categories based on their epitopes on the viral Env (figure 1A).

78

CR3022, a nAb isolated from a convalescent SARS-CoV patient (15), which has been shown to cross-

79

react with SARS-CoV-2 (7), was used as positive control while two antibodies targeting the envelope

80

glycoprotein of simian immunodeficiency virus were used as negative control. Of the 30 HIV-1 bnAbs

81

tested for binding to both S2Pecto protein and RBD of SARS-CoV-2, 6 bnAbs (VRC07.523LS, NIH45-46

82

G54W, N6, Z13e1, 2F5 and 4E10) showed significant binding, while one bnAb (CAP256.09) showed

83

moderate binding to only the S2Pecto protein (figure 1A). Non-nAbs that target post-fusion and/or open

84

trimeric conformation of HIV-1 Env were unable to bind both SARS-CoV-2 S2Pecto protein and RBD

85

protein (figure 1B), suggesting that only pre-fusion state specific antibodies that evolve via extensive

86

somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation in response to repeated exposure to a continuously

87

evolving antigen can cross react with other viruses.

antibodies were assessed by ELISA using SARS-CoV-2RBD and SARS-CoV-2 S2Pecto. CR3022, a SARS-CoV
neutralizing antibody, was used as positive control. Two antibodies targeting SIV Env were used as negative
control. Area under curve (AUC) of OD450 values of a 12-point binding curve (range, 0.0048 to 10 µg/ml) from three
independent experiments are shown. (C) Two-tailed Spearman’s correlation was calculated using the area under
curve (AUC) values. A significant positive correlation was observed between RBD and S2P ecto (spearman r =
0.8879, p <0.0001). (D) Binding of HIV-1 bnAbs that showed cross-reactivity to S2P and RBD domain of SARSCoV-2 in ELISA to full-length SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein expressed on the surface of HEK293T cells. Average
median fluorescence intensity values of a 12-point binding curve (range, 0.0048 to 10 µg/ml) from three
independent experiments were used to draw the curve. CR3022, a SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody, was used as
positive control.

102

Though reactivity against RBD was stronger than S2Pecto protein for majority of the bnAbs tested, a

103

significant positive correlation was seen between binding to S2Pecto protein and RBD (Figure 1C). All

104

the 6 bnAbs that showed binding reactivity in ELISA exhibited a similar binding profile to the cell surface

105

expressed SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein (figure 1D). Of the 30 monoclonal antibodies tested herein,

106

bnAbs targeting the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of HIV-1 showed maximum binding to

107

both the S protein and RBD with half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 0.71 µg/ml and 1.71

108

µg/ml (Z13e1), 0.048 µg/ml and 2.91 µg/ml (2F5) and 0.79 and 0.33 µg/ml (4E10) µg/ml to the RBD

109

and S2Pecto respectively. VRC07.523LS is an engineered variant of the VRC01 bnAb with higher SHM

110

(16) and while it showed binding to both S2Pecto protein and RBD, both VRC01 and its somatic related

111

clone VRC03 did not show any binding (figure 2A – B).

Figure 3 – Neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by HIV-1 bnAbs. (A) The bnAbs were tested for neutralization of
pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virions. Percent neutralization was calculated by assessing relative luminescence units
(RLU) in cell lysates of HEK293T-ACE2 cells 48 hours after infection with SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses in the
presence of increasing amounts of bnAbs (range, 0.0048 to 10 µg/ml). N6, an anti-HIV-1 CD4-binding site bnAb,
showed cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. Dotted line corresponds to 50% neutralization. Graphs were plotted
using average values (percent neutralization) from three independent experiments. (B) Affinity of N6 against SARSCoV-2 RBD was measured using biolayer interferometry. (C) Competition ELISA was performed for RBD binding
to ACE2 in presence and absence of N6. Average OD450 value from three independent experiments are shown.

126

All 6 HIV-1 bnAbs that showed binding to SARS-CoV-2 S protein and RBD were then tested for their

127

ability to block infection using a HIV-1 pseudovirus based neutralization assay utilizing SARS-CoV-2

128

spike protein. VSV-G and MLV pseudotyped viruses were used as negative control. Except N6, all

129

remaining five bnAbs failed to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 (figure 3A). Though N6 showed neutralization

130

of SARS-CoV-2, it failed to show complete neutralization (maximum percent neutralization of 88% with

131

an IC50 of 0.988 µg/ml) and had a moderate affinity of 1.04 x 108 M (figure 3B). Furthermore, N6 failed

132

to block RBD binding to soluble ACE2 by ELISA (figure 3C), suggesting it recognizes an epitope on

133

RBD outside the ACE2 binding site. It is noteworthy that N6 is a member of the VRC01 class of

134

antibodies that target the CD4bs of HIV-1; it recognizes HIV-1 in an unusual orientation and neutralizes

135

HIV-1 isolates that are typically resistant to other VRC01 class bnAbs (17). Furthermore, it can tolerate

136

absence of key CD4bs antibody contact residues across the length of heavy chain and can tolerate

137

escape mutations that typically provide resistance to HIV-1 from other CD4bs bnAbs. Of note, N6 has

138

an unprecedented degree of somatic hypermutation (31% in heavy and 25% in light chain at the

139

nucleotide level).

Figure 4 – Polyclonal plasma of HIV-1 infected children neutralizes SARS-CoV-2. (A) Cross-reactivity of antiHIV-1 neutralizing plasma antibodies from ten children with chronic HIV-1 infection against SARS-CoV-2RBD and
SARS-CoV-2 S2Pecto was assessed by ELISA. Plasma antibodies from three seronegative healthy donors were
used as negative control. Area under the curve (AUC) of OD450 values of a 12-point binding curve (range, inverse
plasma dilution of 100 to 51200), from three independent experiments are shown. (B) Plasma samples were tested
for their neutralization of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virions. Percent neutralization was calculated by assessing
relative luminescence units (RLU) in cell lysates of HEK293T-ACE2 cells 48 hours after infection with SARS-CoV2 pseudoviruses in the presence of increasing dilution of plasma samples (range, inverse plasma dilution of 100 to
51200). (C) Respective ID50 (50% inhibitory dilution) for plasma from all ten children are shown.

150

We next tested plasma antibodies of children with chronic HIV-1 infection for their ability to bind SARS-

151

CoV-2 S2Pecto protein and RBD. Ten children that had shown potent neutralization titre against a 12-

152

virus global panel of HIV-1 isolates from previous studies in our lab were selected (18–20). While all

153

ten children showed significant binding to both S2Pecto and RBD (figure 4A), three children showed

154

potent and near-complete neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses (AIIMS329, AIIMS330,

155

AIIMS346) while two children (AIIMS355 and AIIMS521) showed moderate neutralization of SARS-

156

CoV-2 (figure 4B – C). Collectively, our findings highlight the ability of HIV-1 specific bnAbs and

157

polyclonal plasma to cross-react with the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2.

158

Neutralizing antibodies engage the host immune system to clear the pathogen or infected cells and are

159

promising candidates for combating emerging viruses (21–23). The RBD of coronaviruses are highly

160

immunogenic and infected individuals typically mount a nAb response (10, 24–28). Given that several

161

HIV-1 bnAbs showed cross-reactivity with RBD of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, vaccine efforts

162

should focus inducing antibodies targeting the cross-reactive epitopes on RBD. Most HIV-1 vaccine

163

candidates are in the stage where they typically induce tier 1B or 2 responses against autologous and

164

heterologous viruses in rabbits and non-human primates (29–31). A germline targeting HIV-1 candidate

165

immunogen (eOD-GT8) which was designed to prime VRC01 class CD4bs directed antibodies has

166

been described and the frequencies and affinity of B cells from healthy HIV-1 uninfected individuals

167

recognizing this germline-targeting immunogen showed its suitability as a candidate human vaccine

168

prime (32, 33). Naive B-cells that recognised eOD-GT8 had L-CDR3 sequences that matched several

169

VRC01 class bnAbs, suggesting B-cells with light chain sequences for VRC01 class exist at high

170

frequency. Based on the above observations and the availability of sera from these immunized animals,

171

and findings herein of the ability of HIV-1 CD4bs directed bnAbs to inhibit SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-

172

2 pseudovirus infection, it is pertinent that the immune sera be tested for binding and neutralization of

173

SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, detailed structural studies should be taken with N6 to identify its epitope

and neutralization determinants, which can be used to engineer its variants as effective SARS-CoV-2

175

therapeutics.

176

Understanding cross-reactive neutralization epitopes of antibodies generated in divergent viral

177

infections can provide key evidence for engineering so called super-antibodies (antibodies that can

178

potently neutralize diverse pathogens with similar antigenic features). Such cross-reactive antibodies

179

can provide a blueprint upon which synthetic variants can be generated in the face of future pandemics.

208

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 ectodomain and RBD constructs were transiently transfected in Expi293F

209

cells at a density of 2 million cells/mL using polyethylenimine and expression plasmids at a molar ratio

210

of 3:1 and purified from clarified transfected culture supernatants 4-days post-transfection using Ni2+-

211

NTA affinity chromatography (GE Life Sciences). Proteins were eluted from the column using 250

212

mmol/L imidazole, dialyzed into phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2 and concentrated using

213

Amicon 10-kDa (RBD) and 100-kDa (S2Pecto) Amicon ultra-15 centrifugal filter units (EMD Millipore).

214

Protein concentration was determined by the Nanodrop method using the protein molecular weight and

215

molar extinction coefficient as determined by the online ExPASy software (ProtParam).

216

Antibody production and purification

217

The HIV-1 monoclonal antibodies (PGT145, CAP256.25, VRC01, 10-1074, BG18, AIIMS-P01, and

218

PGT151) were expressed by co-transfection of heavy chain and light chain IgG1 plasmids (1:1 molar

219

ratio) in Expi293F cells at a density of 0.8 – 1.2 million cells/mL using PEI-Max (1:3 molar ratio) as the

220

transfection reagent. Five days post-transfection, antibodies were purified from clarified supernatants

221

using protein A beads, eluted with IgG elution buffer and concentrated using 10-kDa Amicon ultra-15

222

centrifugal filter units (EMD Millipore).

223

Binding ELISA

224

96-well microtiter plates were coated overnight with 2 µg/ml of purified SARS-CoV S2Pecro, SARS-CoV-

225

2 S2Pecto, SARS-CoV RBD and SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Plates were blocked with 1% BSA for 3 hours.

226

Monoclonal antibodies were added at a starting concentration of 10 µg/ml, with 11-point titration, and

227

incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-human IgG

228

was used as secondary antibody and TMB substrate was used for color development. Absorbance at

229

450 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer.

230

Generation of 293T-ACE2 cells

231

VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviruses packaging the human ACE2 were generated by co-transfecting the

232

HEK293T cells with pHAGE6-CMV-ACE2-ZsGreen plasmid and lentiviral helper plasmids (HDM-VSV-

233

G, HDM-Hgpm2, HDM-Tat and CMV-Rev). 48 hours post-transfection, lentiviruses were harvested and

234

used to infect HEK293T cells pre-seeded 24-hours in the presence of 10 µg/ml polybrene. 3-days post-

235

infection, transduced cells were sorted via flow cytometry and maintained as a polyclonal pool of 293T-

236

ACE2 cells in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS (vol/vol), 10mM HEPES, 1mM sodium

237

pyruvate, and 100 U ml-1 penicillin/streptomycin at 37oC in 5% CO2.

238

Viruses

239

To generate HIV-1 based SARS pseudotyped viral stocks, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with

240

CMV-Luc, R∆8.2 backbone plasmid, pTMPRSS2 and pSARS-CoV-Strunc or pSARS-CoV-2trunc using

241

polyethylenimine. Six hours post-transfection, cells were washed twice with RPMI and fresh media (10%

242

DMEM) was added. Supernatants containing virions were harvested 48 hours post-transfection, filtered

243

and stored at -80oC. infectivity of pseudoviruses was determined by titration on 293T-ACE2 cells.

plasmid expressing firefly luciferase and serine protease TMPRSS2 (CMV-Luc, R∆8.2 backbone

247

plasmid, pTMPRSS2) in 1.25 x 105 HEK293T cells for 48 hours. Post-transfection, culture supernatants

248

were harvested, filtered and stored at -80oC. For determination of neutralization potential of bnAbs,

249

eight-point titration curves with 2-fold serial dilution starting at 10 µg/ml, were performed. Serially diluted

250

bnAbs were mixed with pseudotyped viruses for 1 hour at 37 oC. pseudovirus/bnAb combinations were

251

then added to 293T-ACE2 cells pre-seeded (24-hours) at 10,000 cells/well. After 48 – 72 hours,

252

supernatant was removed and luminescence was measured on Tecan luminescence plate reader using

253

Bright Glow reagent. The percent infectivity was calculated as ratio of relative luminescence units (RLU)

254

readout in the presence of bnAbs normalized to RLU readout in the absence of mAb. The half maximal

255

inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were determined using 4-parameter logistic regression (GraphPad

256

Prism version 8.3).

257

Biolayer interferometry analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding affinity with N6 bnAb

258

Biolayer interferometry was performed using an Octet Red96 instrument (ForteBio, Inc.). A 5 μg/ml

259

concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-His was immobilized on a Ni-NTA coated biosensor surface. The

260

baseline was obtained by measurements taken for 30 s in running buffer (1x PBS, 0.1% BSA and 0.02%

261

Tween-20), and then, the sensors were subjected to association phase immersion for 300 s in wells

262

containing N6 bnAb diluted in running buffer. Then, the sensors were immersed in running buffer for

263

600 s to measure dissociation. Biosensor was then regenerated by dipping it in EDTA followed by nickel

264

sulfate solution. The mean Kon, Koff and apparent KD values of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding affinity

265

for N6 bnAb were calculated from all the binding curves based on their global fit to a 1:1 Langmuir

266

binding model.

267

Cell surface binding assay

268

1.25 x 105 HEK293T cells seeded in a 12-well plate were transiently transfected with 1.25 µg of SARS-

269

CoV-2 S full-length protein using PEI-MAX. 48 hours post-transfection, cells were harvested and per

270

experimental requirement, distributed in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes. For monoclonal antibody

271

staining, 10 µg/ml of antibody was used and titrated 2-fold in staining buffer. 100 µl of primary antibody

272

(HIV-1 specific monoclonals) were added to HEK293T cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S, and incubated

273

for 30 minutes at room temperature. After washing, 100 µl of 1:500 diluted PE conjugated mouse anti-

274

human IgG Fc was added, and after 30-minute incubation, a total of 50,000 cells were acquired on BD

275

LSRFortessa X20. Data was analyzed using FlowJo software (version v10.6.1).

276

Statistics and Reproducibility

277

All statistical analyses were performed on GraphPad Prism 8.3. A p-value of <0.05 was considered

278

significant. Neutralization assays were performed in triplicates and repeated thrice. Average IC50

279

values are shown and used for statistical comparisons. Binding ELISAs were performed in duplicates

280

and repeated thrice. Average OD450 values were used for plotting curves. Surface binding assay was
