Abstract
Recently classified as a pandemic by WHO, novel Corononavirus 2019 has affected
almost every corner of the globe causing human deaths in a range of hundred thousands.
The virus having its roots in Wuhan (China) has been spread over the world by its own
property to change itself accordingly. These changes correspond to its transmission and
pathogenicity due to which the concept of social distancing appeared into the picture.
In this paper, a few findings from the whole genome sequence analysis of viral genome
sequences submitted from India are presented. The data used for analysis comprises 440
collective genome sequences of virus submitted in GenBank, GISAID, and SRA projects,
from around the world as well as 28 viral sequences from India. Multiple sequence
alignment of all genome sequences was performed and analysed. A novel
non-synonymous mutation 4809C>T (S1515F) in NSP3 gene of SARS-CoV2 Indian
strains is reported along with other frequent and important changes from around the
world: 3037C>T, 14408C>T, and 23403A>G. The novel change was observed in
samples collected in the month of March, whereas was found to be absent in samples
collected in January with the respective persons’ travel history to China. Phylogenetic
analysis clustered the sequences with this change as one separate clade. Mutation was
predicted as stabilising change by insilco tool DynaMut. A second patient in the world
to our knowledge with multiple (Wuhan and USA) strain contraction was observed in
this study. The infected person is among the two early infected patients with travel
history to China. Strains sequenced in Iran stood out to have different variants, as most
of the reported frequent variants were not observed. The objective of this paper is to
highlight the similarities and changes observed in the submitted Indian viral strains.
This helps to keep track on the activity, that how virus is changing into a new subtype.
Major strains observed were European with the novel change in India and other being
emergent clade of Iran. Its important to observe the changes in NSP3 gene, as this gene
has been reported with extensive positive selection as well as potential drug target.
Extensive Positive Selection Drives the Evolution of Nonstructural Proteins. With the
limited number of sequences this was the only frequent novel non-synonymous change
observed from Indian strains, thereby making this change vulnerable for investigation in
future. This paper has a special focus on tracking of Indian viral sequences submitted in
public domain.

Introduction

1

The pandemic of COVID-19 is taking a troll in health and finance sector of all most
every country. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2)
originated from Wuhan a city in China is mutating while getting transmitted [3].
Development of a potential drug or vaccine is a major challenge. The virus has RNA as
a genetic material and it gets mutated frequently. It is very important to understand
the evolutionary feature in the virus. Understanding the nature of mutation may help in
developing potential drug. Also, it may give direction to understand the next cycle of
mutation in the viral genome. Therefore, it is very important to understand the nature
of variation in different strains of the novel virus.
In this regard, few studies are conducted to understand the nature of variation in
this novel virus. Carmine and Federico [4] made an attempt to understand the
heterogeneity in 54 strains of this viral genome. Rahila et al. [16] studied impact of the
mutations in the spike glycoprotein function and stability in the novel virus.
Changchuan [20] presented a method for effectively genotyping SARS-CoV-2 viruses
using complete genomes.
In this report, an analysis of 468 novel and early virus genome is presented. The 440
sequences are from different parts of the world including countries from Europe, USA,
Middle East, Asia and 28 sequences submitted from India with 11 sequenced in Iran.
The data was downloaded from GenBank, GISAID, and SRA. Data was collected for
this study last as of 9th April 2020, with 440 genome sequence of the novel and early
strains from the world along with 28 sequences from India. The MEGAX tool [11] has
been used to perform the analysis. It is based on Tamura-Nei model and
Neighbour-Joining method along with 100 bootstrap. This study adds up a novel
non-synonymous mutation 4809C>T (S1515F) in NSP3 gene only observed in strains
obtained from India. Various studies revealed that the NSP3 gene harbours many
mutations as this gene has been reported with extensive positive selection towards
evolution in Betacoronaviruses [18], [7]. Common mutations among different strains
were also identified and reported. The sequence containing the mutation was used to
build protein model using SWISS-Model. Followed by the usage of the DynaMut tool to
study effect of mutation on protein stability. The results indicate the clade of variations
in the Indian SARS-CoV2. Also, potential region of mutations in near future along with
the effect of non-synonymous mutation at the protein level. This paper represents the
initial observations on submitted 28 sequences of Indian viral strains.

Sequence collection: total 468 sequenced strains were selected, 440 from different parts
of the world including countries from Europe, USA, Middle East, Asia and 28 sequences
submitted from India with 11 sequenced in Iran. Sequences were downloaded from
GenBank, GISAID, and SRA project (PRJNA607948). Information of samples used in
this study are provided as supplementary material.
SRA project sequences were aligned to human genome assembly (hg19) using
HiSat2 [10], to remove the human contamination in viral sequences. Next the unaligned
region to hg19 was aligned to SARS-CoV2 ref sequence (NC 045512) using
SamTools [13] and HiSat2. Consensus fasta sequence of four viral strains of project were
obtained using BcfTools [13].
Multiple Sequence alignment was performed on all 468 sequences using MAFFT
(Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform). Alignment was visualised in
JalView 2.11.0. The reported and novel mutation site were extracted to calculate the
position specific frequency in all the strains. SWISS-Model was used to build the

This section describes about the different types of mutations discovered in the analysis
along with an analysis of the mutation at protein level.

The Common Mutations

57

Genome sequences of 440 viral strains submitted from different parts of the world were
collected from GenBank, GISAID and SRA project. In order to investigate the changes
in 28 viral strains submitted from India a sequence level and phylogenetic analysis was
performed. Multiple sequence alignment of these collected sequences was visualised to
collect the positions in Indian strains with mutations.
There has been a report on SNP mutations in SARS-CoV2 genome which majorly
demonstrated mutations frequent in European strains [20]. These mutations were
analysed in 28 submitted sequences from India. A previous report from India observed
unique mutation in spike protein (A930V (24351C>T)), this mutation was identified in
one (Sample 2) of the early infected patients’ viral sequence [16]. The most common
SNP’s that were observed in this analysis includes the previously reported mutation in
leader sequence (241C>T), Coronaviruses includes subgenomic identical 50 Leader
sequence which plays role in viral replication process. This mutation was seen to
co-evolved with other three important mutations in gene NSP3: 3037C>T
(synonymous), RNA primase: 14408C>T and Spike protein: 23403A>G. In context to
Indian strains the early collected samples with travel history to China (Sample 1 and
Sample 2) exhibited none of the co-evolved variation (3037C>T, 14408C>T and
23403A>G) with leader sequence variant (241C>T). With recently submitted 11 strain
sequences of Indian resident sequenced in Iran (Sample 18 to Sample 28), all the three
variants along with leader sequence variant was not observed. In remaining 14 strains
(Sample 3 to Sample 16), these four changes were observed as these included (Sample 5
to Sample 9) Italian tourist, one (Sample 3) with travel history to Italy, one (Sample 4)
was Indian contact to Italian tourist and 7 (Sample 10 to Sample 16) strains from
VERO CCL81 isolate P1. These three along with 241C>T, co-mutations were
suggested to increase the transmission [20].

Mutations in the Different Non-Structural Protein (NSP) Genes
Two of the mutations 3037C>T (F106F) and 14408C>T (P323L) are associated with
RNA replication mechanism. The variation reported in NSP3 (3037C>T) lies in
N-terminal of the gene. In SARS-CoV gene NSP3 has a critical interaction with
Nucleocapsid protein via N-terminal ubiquitin like domain (Ubl), there results suggested
that the interaction serves to tether the genome to the newly translated
replicase-transcriptase complex at a very early stage of infection [8]. Spike protein has
been a hotspot in CoV2 genome since the beginning due to the presence of
receptor-binding domain. Contact point to the host includes the domains from S1
subunit of this S-protein [19]. The mutation observed 23403A>G (D614G) lies in tail
region of this S1 subunit and before the cleavage site of another subunit called S2 of
S-protein.

Talking in terms of RNA replication of SARS-CoV ORF1a and ORF1b
(replicase/transcriptase) which includes NSP8 and NSP4 genes have been highlighted.
Two linked SNP’s one in NSP4, 8782C>T (S75S) included in codon for Serine residue
and other in NSP8, 28144T>C (L84S) included in codon for Leucine residue, according
to the population genetic study on 103 SARS-CoV2 genomes has been named as
S-type(“CT-bases at two positions”) and L-type(“TC-bases at two positions”) of
strains [17]. Strikingly sequence from one (Sample 2) of the early infected persons’ viral
genome contains both linked SNP while the other one has absence of both. From other
sequences only two (Sample 8 and Sample 9) strains of Italian tourist were presented
with 8782C>T change. The other abundant variation observed in Europeans was
26144G>T (G251V) in NSP3 gene and three consecutive mutations observed the most
in US strains 28881G>A (R203K), 28881G>A (R202R), 28882G>A (G204R).
Surprisingly, this 26144G>T change was not observed in any of the strains, including
the strains from Italian tourists. Three consecutive variations were observed in only one
(Sample 2) of the early strain that also contained both S-type and L-type linked SNP.
Recent strains (Sample 18 to Sample 28) submitted from Indian resident sequenced
at Iran had mutations in other positions then mentioned above. Position 884C>T
(Figure 1) change in NSP2 gene was observed in 9 strains out of 11 (Sample 18 to
Sample 25, Sample 27 and Sample 28), these variations were observed in 2 strains
(GISAID Id: EPI ISL 416541 and EPI ISL 416458) from Kuwait and 1 strain
(GISAID ID:EPI ISL 417444) from Pakistan Gilgit region. Out of two from Kuwait one
had travel history to Iran and other was sample from Quarantine center. Also Pakistan
strain collected from sample had a travel history to Iran. Second variant 1397G>A
(Figure 1) reported in preprint [14] from NSP2 gene was observed in all Indian strains
(Sample 18 to Sample 28) from Iran along with same 2 (GISAID Id: EPI ISL 416541
and EPI ISL 416458) strains from kuwait, 1 Pakistan Gilgit strain
(GISAID ID:EPI ISL 417444) and additionally in one strain (GISAID IF:
EPI ISL 417521) from Taiwan with no information about travel. Variant 8653G>T
(Figure 1) in NSP4 gene was observed in 9 strains (Sample 18 to Sample 25, Sample 27
and Sample 28), along with two strains (GISAID Id: EPI ISL 416541 and
EPI ISL 416458) from Kuwait. The reported variant 11083G>T (Figure 1) of NSP6 was
presented in all strains (Sample 18 to Sample 28) which had a reported frequency of 115
from [20]. Another frequent mutation 28688T>C (Figure 1) in ORF9, was observed in
all Indian strains (Sample 18 to Sample 28) sequenced in Iran. This variation was
observed in above mentioned two Kuwait strain (GISAID ID:EPI ISL 417444) and one
strain from Taiwan (GISAID IF: EPI ISL 417521). The variant 29742G>T (Figure 1),
was observed in 3’UTR region. Base change observed at this position G>T; was
identified in 2 strains from Kuwait (GISAID Id: EPI ISL 416541 and EPI ISL 416458)
and 1 strain from Taiwan (GISAID IF: EPI ISL 417521), whereas two strain sequences
from US (MT106052.1 and MT263386.1) presented G>A at this position.

There was one novel mutation observed in sequences from India in NSP3 gene 4809C>T
(S697F) (Figure 1) a non-synonymous change. This observed mutation is close to the
reported synonymous variation 3037C>T (F106F). There were 17 strains (Sample 4 to
Sample 9 and Sample 11 to Sample 16) which got sequenced in India, out of these 12
strains including sequences from 5 (Sample 5 to Sample 9) Italian tourist, 6 (Sample 11
to Sample 16) Vero CCL81 isolate P1 and one (Sample 4) from sample who was
reported to have Indian contact to Italian tourist were observed with this change.
Besides the personal point mutations in one or two strains, this novel mutation was
observed as frequent among the strains sequenced in India. Interestingly this variant
was not found in any European, US or other strains included in this study.

SARS-CoV2 has been reported to have second highest identity (82.30%) with
SARS-COV. To identify the possible role and relevance of the region observing the
mutation, sequence alignment of NSP3 protein from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 was
performed. NSP3 gene along with NSP4 are the key players for membrane
rearrangement in form of Double Membrane Vesicles (DMV) upon infection [2]. Report
on role of mutations in important glycosylation sites in NSP4 gene in SARS-Cov have
been observed and were indicative of localisation problems with other NSP protein like
NSP3 [5]. As per this there will be a requirement to observe the site of novel change for
its impact on NSP3 gene interactions, which may even serve as a potential candidate for
therapeutics, depending upon the mutational effect shown in NSP4 [5]. The other
predictive outcome can come as benefit to virus in terms of interaction.
In [8], the authors reported domain organisation of NSP3 gene from SARS-CoV. The
mutation was identified in SARS-Unique Domain (SUD). The patch of 162 amino acid
near the mutation was observed to align in SARS-CoV’s SUD-C subdomain, a
frataxin-like domain. Till now the subdomains in SUD have not been identified in
SARS-CoV2. The role of this domain involves binding to single-stranded RNA and
recognize purine bases more strongly than pyrimidine bases [9]. Though the very crucial
role of SUD-C has not been recognised in SARS-CoV but in few reports SUD-C has
been shown to have RNA-binding ability, and concerted actions by the subdomains of
SUD have been proposed to ensure specific RNA binding [9].The complete deletion of
the SUD-C domain within the context of a SARS-CoV was found to have large
reduction of RNA synthesis, but some basal RTC activity remains [12]. PDB blast
confirmed the presence of mutation in SUD domain of SARS-CoV with 74% identity to
2KAF (PDB-ID). Using Swiss model this particular domain was modelled for Reference
Wuhan sequence (NC 045521)and the change was observed by insilco protein stability
tool DynaMut [15]. The change was predicted to be stabilising by DynaMut and
destabilising by 3 others. The DynaMut is more elaborative prediction tool. So far a
destabilising mutation in NSP3 gene of SARS-CoV2 has been indicative of only
differentiation from SARS-CoV [1].
Figure 1 contains MSA alignment of the novel non-synonymous mutation 4809C>T
and few mutations from Iran samples.

The novel Coronavirus, being identified as a global threat have been the prime focus of
research and investigation around the globe. Since its outbreak in Wuhan (China) it has
taken up several changes to keep the survival high. There are reports by several groups
on mutations observed in the strains from different countries [16] [20] [16]. Here, in this
study, the primary focus is on strains submitted by India. The country is suspected to
have more number of positive cases than actually reported and also, there is increase in
the number of cases despite the lockdown implemented by the government. With
increasing number of cases the virus might have incorporated some new changes to
enhance its transmission and virulence. Hence, it becomes important to interrogate the
strains submitted to observe the similarities and changes from other strains in the world.
There are some interesting results from this sequence observation analysis. Two of
the early collected samples (Sample 1 and Sample 2) with travel history to China were
sampled within the gap of 03 days. They were observed with none of the European
reported frequent variations. Interestingly one (Sample 2) of them had incorporated the
change in both linked SNP’s (8782C>T and 28144T>C) and one could suspect that he
might have been infected with the S-type as well as L-type of strain. This is the second
report of such event, there has been one more case reported from the US [17]. The
cause of this is unclear, but there is a possibility as per previous report that patient

might have infected multiple times. This same infected person has another notable
change of three consecutive positions (28881G>A, 28882G>A, and 28883G>C)
reported mainly in the US. To an extent it clears the doubt that person might have
contracted multiple strains (Asian and American), thereby carrying both S and L types
of strain along with the US reported mutation. L-type was found to be more aggressive
strain before Jan 2020 [17]. People who might have contracted this patient would have
been at higher risk of infection. In phylogenetic tree analysis these two strains could be
observed without branching from the ancestral strain and in vicinity to reference strain
sequence (NC 045512) Figure 2.
Sequences submitted recently from 11 strains (Sample 18 to Sample 28) of Indian
citizens sequenced at Iran gave a different picture. These strains does not include any of
the reported frequent variant circulating in the world. This clears that these are all
Wuhan- like strains with some potential other changes contributing towards the
diversity of the virus [6]. This diversity can be associated with fitness or transmission
by viral genome. Among the 5 frequent mutations observed in these strains, 2 were
reported mutation (11083G>T and 1397G>A, [20]. Divergence from the main strain
can be easily pointed out in the constructed phylogenetic tree (Figure 2) with additional
root node. These variants could not be observed in sequences submitted from Iran as
they had sequenced mainly the nucleocapsid protein.
The novel mutation 4809C>T observed even with this small number of strains
sequenced in India with varied travel history and ethnicity. The observed mutation is
non-synonymous change observed in 1.7Kb region of NSP3 region, with other being
3037C>T. Indeed the variant is absent in any other strain included in this study along
with Europeans. This change has occurred in strains obtained from all the Italian
tourists (Sample 5 to Sample 9), the person (Sample 4) who had contracted with Italian
tourist and 6 (Sample 11 to Sample 16) of the Vero CCL81 isolate P1 sequenced in India.
It seems to be absent in the strain sequenced from patient with travel history to Italy.
One probable explanation to this novel non-synonymous change could be related to
its increased transmission rate since it is being observed to be incorporated in
combination with already co-existing mutations [20]. The mutation was predicted with
stabilising effect, hence no change at secondary structure level was observed Figure 3.
Interaction experiments or insilico docking might help to understand its effect more
clearly. Adaptive evolutionary changes in NSP3 gene have been discerned with
betacoronaviruses, which might contribute towards the host-range or other viral
phenotypes [7]. In a recent study [18] on analysing the possible drug targets through
computational methods have highligthed the range of chemical and natural products
with anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties have high binding affinity to
NSP3c (SUD-domain) along with NSP1 and ORF7. Among the few drugs they reported
ritonavir, lopinavir and mostly the anti-viral drugs binds with NSP3c. Though they had
the limitations and false positives also, but its nonetheless important to consider this
domain as potential drug target against SARS-CoV2. This change could be viewed as
potential next change a virus might have incorporated to form a new subtype in India
as a response to positive selection. Second probable reason could be that the other
domains from SUD-SARS-CoV (SUD-N and SUD-M) have been reported to have effect
on their binding with G-quadruplexes in human host upon mutations [12]. Thereby
change in this SUD-C might have been beneficial, not affecting much the response of
virus against host but providing some kind of fitness with the replication or
transcription mechanism. As mentioned earlier SUD-C and combination of SUD-MC
are involved in RNA binding process [9]. Further biochemical validation or insilico
docking analysis are required to observe the effect of this change on RNA-binding.
With earlier reported important mutations 241-C>T, 3037C>T, 14408C>T,
23403A>G this additional novel mutation has been added 241C>T, 3037-C>T,

14408C>T, 23403A>G, 4809C>T presented in Figure 4.
As discerned with reported frequent mutations in Europeans, the inference could be
made that these mutations could be correlated to efficiency of viral transmission, since
Europe has emerged with most adverse effects by the virus. The virus have been
reported with slow changes and thereby found to be circulating in few major forms.
Looking at the data from Indian strains it has majorily the European strain with the
novel change observed in this study. The other subtype observed was the Indian citizens
sequenced in Iran. In a phylogenetic tree analysis (Figure 2) it was observed that
strains containing this novel mutation were branched together and separate clad of
citizens came from Iran.
Novel incorporation of one more mutation could be associated with its transmission
in Indian population. This change might add up as new member to the group of number
of changes the virus has taken in course of evolution in India since the first Italian case
identified in Mar 2020. Until now no strain has been declared more lethal in comparison
with other, but transmission has been the prime observation, which to an extent could
be controlled by social distancing mechanism. This speculation is being made from the
very early observations and based on what has been the mutational trend in and around
the world. The limitation of this study is the less number of sequences submitted from
India. There is an emergent need of more public data sharing from Indian community
to track new subtypes of virus, impact of the changes it is incorporating and where the
hotspot for therapeutics lies. India is observing the rapid increase in number of cases
despite of country lockdown, it makes the analysis of viral strains more crucial. Besides
the limitation this study adds up a position to be interrogated in future with more
number of sequences and biochemical assays in order to understand its importance in
viral machinery.
