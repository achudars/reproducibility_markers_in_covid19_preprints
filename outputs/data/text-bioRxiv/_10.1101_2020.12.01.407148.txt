ABSTRACT

21

Sexual dimorphisms in immune responses contribute to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

22

outcomes, yet the mechanisms governing this disparity remain incompletely understood. We carried out

23

sex-balanced sampling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from confirmed COVID-19 inpatients and

24

outpatients, uninfected close contacts, and healthy controls for 36-color flow cytometry and single cell

25

RNA-sequencing. Our results revealed a pronounced reduction of circulating mucosal associated

26

invariant T (MAIT) cells in infected females. Integration of published COVID-19 airway tissue datasets

27

implicate that this reduction represented a major wave of MAIT cell extravasation during early infection

28

in females. Moreover, female MAIT cells possessed an immunologically active gene signature, whereas

29

male counterparts were pro-apoptotic. Collectively, our findings uncover a female-specific protective

30

MAIT profile, potentially shedding light on reduced COVID-19 susceptibility in females.

MAIN TEXT

32

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to a global pandemic of

33

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and a death toll of more than over 1.4 million people and rising

34

(1). Among reported sex disaggregated data, males are disproportionately affected by SARS-CoV-2,

35

with a higher incidence of cases, mortality, and morbidity (2). This follows a similar trend toward higher

36

case fatality rates for males in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and

37

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as well as with experiments using

38

SARS-CoV mouse models (2-6). Sex differences in the immune response are thought to be a key

39

contributing factor to these coronavirus disease outcomes, agreeing with the current body of knowledge

40

that innate and adaptive immune responses are substantially altered across sex (7-10). Specific to

41

SARS-CoV-2 infection, responses of both lymphocytes and myeloid cells were shown to be associated

42

with COVID-19 outcomes (11-19). Correspondingly, a recent study on sex differences in COVID-19

43

immune responses uncovered an association between poor disease outcomes in males and weak T

44

cell responses in both CD4+ and CD8+ compartments, whereas poor outcomes in females were

45

associated with high innate immune cytokines, tumor necrosis factor superfamily (TNFSF)-10 and

46

interleukin (IL)-15 (20). The sex differences elucidated in this seminal study further cement the need to

47

better understand the mechanisms governing sex-specific susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.

48

In the current study, we carried out sex-balanced sampling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells

49

(PBMCs) from COVID-19 patients and control subjects for 36-color flow cytometry and single cell RNA-

50

sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses. A total of 88 samples were analyzed from 45 individuals. Details on

51

subject demographics and sample information are summarized in (Fig. 1A, table 1 and S1). Briefly, we

52

analyzed samples from 28 patients with COVID-19 as confirmed by a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR

53

and/or IgG seroconversion. These included 9 inpatient subjects (20%), 7 requiring intensive care,

54

henceforth referred to as “hospitalized.” An additional 19 subjects were identified in outpatient settings

55

(42.2%), henceforth referred to as “infected”. Most of these COVID-19 confirmed cases were sampled

56

longitudinally (a range 1-28 days) including pre- and post- anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobin (IgG)

57

seroconversion. The dates of symptom onset for all confirmed COVID-19 subjects were recorded at

58

enrollment, providing an illness range of 1-40 days. We also recorded symptom severity, obtained via

59

investigator survey on 39 symptoms related to COVID-19 (see Methods). Additionally, we included 7

60

subjects (15.6%) henceforth referred to as “exposed,” who were also sampled at multiple timepoints.

61

These subjects, despite being close contacts of infected individuals, remained with negligible symptom

62

scores, were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, and did not demonstrate detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2

63

IgG for at least 2 months after enrollment. Lastly, we included a group of 10 “healthy” subjects (22.2%)

64

who were enrolled prior to the pandemic in 2019 and did not show any symptoms associated with

65

COVID-19 or other respiratory illness (21).

66

Immune Profiling of COVID-19 Patient PBMCs Reveals Sex Differences in CD8+ Lymphocytes

67

With these flow cytometry data (Table S2), we generated a map of immune cell populations and their

68

subsets by down-sampling to 3,000 viable CD45+ singlets per sample and concatenated all data for

69

Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) (22) and unbiased clustering via Flow Self-

70

Organizing Maps (FlowSOM) (23). Unique marker expressions of respective populations facilitated our

71

annotation of major PBMC populations, including CD4+ and CD8+ () T cells, γ T cells, B cells,

72

plasmablasts, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes (MO), and dendritic cells (DC), and confirmed by

73

manual analysis (Fig. 1B, and fig. S1, A to E). Sub-populations were also annotated in this manner,

74

such as CD45RA+ CD27+ CCR7+ naive, CD45RA– CCR7+ central memory (CM), CD45RA– CCR7–

75

effector memory (EM) and CD45RA+ CD27- CCR7– terminally differentiated effector memory (EMRA)

76

CD8+ T cells, as well as CD8+ CD161hi T cells and other indicated sub-populations (Fig. 1B, and fig.

77

S1, A to E). We noted that a minor population of basophils (Baso) and neutrophils (PMN) primarily from

78

hospitalized patients were detected (Fig. 1B), despite using a PBMC isolation protocol.

79

We next set out to examine our flow cytometry dataset for immune populations that exhibited major

80

quantitative changes in COVID-19. Our first strategy was to stratify the data by disease severity (i.e.,

81

healthy, exposed, infected, and hospitalized). We noted that samples from hospitalized patients had

82

substantially fewer PBMCs suggestive of lymphopenia (24). Manual gating of all flow cytometry events

83

was performed for this analysis. Our results showed differences in B cells (naïve, IgD+ non-class

84

switch, and plasmablasts); natural killer (NK) cells (CD56lo populations); DCs (CD141+, CD1c+, and

85

pDCs); monocytes (classical, intermediate and nonclassical); CD4+ (EM) and CD8+ (EM)  T cells

86

(Fig. S2). Interestingly, our data also revealed a high statistical significance (p=0.0006) in CD8+

87

CD161hi T cells (Fig. S2) prompting us to look closer at these cells. Regarding annotation of this

88

CD161hi cluster, because the overwhelming majority of events are low to negative for CD56 and for T-

89

cell receptor (TCR)-γ (Fig. 1C), the phenotype is largely consistent with mucosal associated invariant

90

T (MAIT) cells, but not NKT or γ T cells. This designation is congruent with recent work in COVID-19

91

PBMCs (25-27). We therefore conclude that the frequencies of certain myeloid and lymphocyte

92

populations are affected in COVID-19, including a major effect on CD8+ CD161hi T cells.

93

Knowing that the overwhelming majority of the CD8+ CD161hi population (henceforth referred to as

94

CD161hi) in our and others’ datasets (25-27) is likely comprised of MAIT cells, we performed a more

95

focused analysis of this cluster in COVID-19 (Fig. S3A). First, we analyzed their frequencies by disease

96

severity using the samples taken within 3 days of enrollment, the timepoint most proximal to the initial

97

symptom score recordings. Results were displayed via UMAP contour plots, revealing a reduction in

98

these cells in the SARS-CoV-2 settings (Fig. 1D). Manual gating from all flow cytometry events

99

revealed a significant reduction when comparing healthy (p=0.0036) or exposed (p=0.0488) subjects

100

versus hospitalized subjects, as well as a negative correlation (p=0.0002) with disease severity (Fig. 1E

101

and Fig. S3B). We also characterized the frequencies of CD161hi cells stratified by time post symptom

102

onset, including early (≤ 14 days), middle (15 to 21 days), and late (>21 days) timepoints. In addition,

103

we separated the data by sex given the known sex differences in immune responses in COVID-19 (2,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.01.407148; this version posted December 1, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

104

20). Results showed that within the CD8+ compartment of healthy subjects, females had greater

105

frequencies of CD161hi cells relative to males, whereas males had greater frequencies of CD8+ memory

106

T cells (combined EMRA, EM and CM) (Fig. 1F, and G). No obvious changes of naïve CD8+ T were

107

found (Fig. S3C). While the memory cell predominance in males was preserved at all timepoints, the

108

greater abundance of CD161hi cells in females was lost at early and middle timepoints (albeit not in late

109

disease). The loss of this difference was due to a precipitous drop of CD161hi cells in females at early

110

and middle timepoints (Fig. 1H). Lastly, we stratified data from confirmed COVID-19 patients by

111

seroconversion status. This showed CD161hi cells were higher in females relative to males prior to

112

seroconversion, whereas CD8+ memory cells were higher in males in seroconverted subjects (Fig. 1I).

113

Taken together, we identified a female-specific decline in circulating CD161hi cell frequencies upon

114

exposure/infection of SARS-CoV-2. This sex-specific reduction may be due to extravasation into airway

115

tissues, thereby suggesting a key sex-specific role for these CD161hi cells in COVID-19.

116

scRNA-seq of PBMCs Implicates Involvement of CD161hi Lymphocyte Responses in COVID-19

117

Given the potentially important role for CD161hi cells in COVID-19, we sought to further characterize

118

this population by scRNA-seq (10x Genomics). We analyzed 48 different PBMC samples from 24

119

subjects across all groups (Table 1 and table S1). Data were processed using Seurat 3 package (28)

120

and subsequent transcript-based annotation was carried out (Fig. 2A, fig. S4, A and B). Focusing on

121

the T cells in the data (Fig. 2B and table S3), we were able to identify CD161hi cells in a single cluster

122

containing high KLRB1 (i.e., CD161) expression, and co-expression of CD3D and CD8A, as well as

123

TRAV1-2 (Fig. 2C and fig. S4B), which encodes the Vα7.2 invariant TCR alpha chain on MAIT cells.

124

Grouping these data by disease severity showed that hospitalized patients had lower frequencies of T

125

cells, including CD161hi cells (Fig. 2D), agreeing with our flow cytometry findings and consistant with

126

reported lymphopenia in severe COVID-19 patients (11, 20, 29-32). Also showing the same trend as

127

our flow cytometry data was the high frequency of CD161hi cells in healthy females (Fig. 2E), although

128

it did not reach statistical significance due to the variations between healthy females and males. Next,

129

to address the functional role of this CD161hi cluster in COVID-19, we performed gene enrichment

130

analysis using differentially expressed genes (DEGs). With several top ranked hits consisting of

131

immune pathways and an estrogen-dependent pathway (Fig. 2F), our results inferred a sex-specific

132

immune response of these CD161hi cells in COVID-19. To further characterize functional inferences, we

133

applied the CellphoneDB package (33) and analyzed ligand-receptor interactions with monocyte

134

clusters within our data (Fig. S5, A and B), given the critical link that was previously published between

135

monocyte activation in COVID-19 outcomes (12, 13, 20, 34). Our results inferred unique interactions

136

between CD161hi cells and monocytes with the following gene-pairs: KLRB1_CLEC2D, CCL5_CCR1,

137

CXCR6_CXCL16, and IL18_IL-18R (Fig. S5, C and D). Moreover, the number of interaction-counts of

138

monocytes was the most abundant with the CD161hi cluster relative to all major T cell populations (Fig.

139

S5E). Taken together, these transcriptome findings further support a significant role for circulating

140

CD161hi cells in the SARS-CoV-2 immune response.

141

Sex-Specific Differences of Circulating MAIT cells in COVID-19

142

To analyze our scRNA-seq dataset for potential sex differences in circulating CD161hi cells, we first

143

sought to examine for phenotypic heterogeneity within this population. To do this, we performed a

144

focused sub-cluster analysis, which generated 3 distinct clusters (Fig. 3A). However, the added

145

resolution revealed a cluster that expressed TRDC, encoding the constant region of the  chain

146

expressed by γ T cells (Fig. 3B) and thereby excluded from subsequent analyses. By contrast, the

147

other two clusters had higher KLRB1 expression, as well as TRAV1- 2 (Fig. 3B), therefore referred to

148

here as MAIT and MAIT clusters. Of note, these 2 clusters make up approximately 80% of CD161hi

149

PBMCs, which is consistent with the previous report of circulating MAIT cell frequencies (25). Our

150

results showed that the MAIT cluster possessed upregulated genes associated with cytotoxic T cells

151

(GNLY, CD8A, CD8B), migration/adhesion (CXCR4, ITGB2), and cytokine signaling (IRF1, B2M,

152

NFKBIA, JUNB, FOS) (Fig. 3C and table S4). The MAIT cluster was enriched for genes of ribosomal

153

proteins, apoptosis (BAX, STUB1) and the linker histone H1 associated with apoptosis (HIST1H1C,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.01.407148; this version posted December 1, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

154

HIST1H1D, HIST1H1E) (Fig. 3C and table S4). Gene enrichment analysis further supported a

155

functional dichotomy for  and  clusters. Whereas MAIT was enriched with several immune process

156

pathways (e.g., IFN-γ, and IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, as well as antigen processing and presenting),

157

MAIT was enriched in cellular responses to external stimuli, metabolism of RNA, viral infection, and

158

programmed cell death, but not immune processes (Fig. 3, D and E, and table S5). Hence our results

159

suggest MAIT cell heterogeneity, with the MAIT signature representing an immunologically

160

poised/active phenotype, while the MAIT signature represents a stressed/apoptotic phenotype.

161

Last for this series of experiments, we sought to determine the dynamics of the two phenotypically

162

distinct clusters by sex over the COVID-19 disease course. By first grouping our data by severity, we

163

found that MAIT was the major phenotype in healthy individuals, while MAIT predominated in

164

exposed and infected groups (Fig. 3, F and G). There was a noted exception for hospitalized patients

165

(Fig. 3F), bearing very few cells as seen in our flow cytometry data, consistent with lymphopenia that

166

occurs in severe COVID-19 (24). We then grouped our data by time post symptom onset, as we

167

detailed earlier with our flow cytometry data. Results showed that relative to healthy subjects, MAIT

168

percentages were lower in early, middle, and late timepoints, whereas MAIT demonstrated the

169

converse (Fig. 3H). When stratified by sex, we found that MAIT cell frequencies were higher in healthy

170

females (Fig. 3, I and J), corroborating our flow cytometry results. These cells in healthy females were

171

skewed toward the MAIT cluster, whereas the few cells present in healthy males consisted mostly of

172

MAIT (Fig. 3I). However, this difference was lost in exposed/infected setting, where both sexes were

173

comprised mostly of MAIT (Fig. 3J). Nonetheless, MAIT percentages were statistically greater in

174

females in late disease (Fig. 3J), which reflects the increased MAIT cells during late infection in

175

females as shown in our flow cytometry findings. Regarding expression of CD69, a T cell activation

176

marker, we did not observe major differences across cluster or sex, but did observe elevated

177

expression in the hospitalized group (Fig. S6, A to D). This possibly suggests an altered MAIT cell

178

response in hospitalized patients (25-27, 35). In short, these results reveal sex specific MAIT cell

179

differences at the quantitative and phenotypic levels in health and COVID-19.

180

Respiratory Tract MAIT Cell Responses Differ by Sex in COVID-19

181

To assess potential sex-specific differences in MAIT cells at the tissue level in COVID-19 patient

182

airways, we utilized published scRNAseq datasets of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (36) and of

183

nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) (37). Beginning our analysis with the BALF dataset, we identified the

184

MAIT cell cluster by expression of TRAV1-2, CD3D, KLRB1 and SLC4A10 (Fig. 4, A to C). With this

185

annotation, we found a significant increase (p=0.0188) of MAIT cells in COVID-19 patients relative to

186

normal controls and a higher MAIT cell frequency (p=0.0332) in females relative to males among

187

COVID-19 subjects (Fig. 4D). This detection of increased MAIT cells in female BALF, along with the

188

drop in these cells we observed in female peripheral blood, suggest a female dominant extravasation of

189

MAITs in COVID-19.

190

To perform the same analysis with NPS samples, we integrated the T cell data from NPS with those

191

from BALF to identify MAIT cells in NPS (Fig. 4, E and F), since TCR genes were not aligned in the

192

NPS dataset (37). With this annotation, we quantified MAIT cell frequencies in the NPS dataset, again

193

observing a significant increase (p=0.0139) in COVID-19 patients (Fig. 4G). We also analyzed the data

194

across severity, observing a significant increase (p=0.0038) in moderate subjects relative to the normal

195

and a decrease (p=0.0366) relative to critical COVID-19 subjects (Fig. 4 H, I). We could not perform the

196

same analysis by sex due to insufficient number of female samples (Fig. 4 I). Nonetheless, these

197

results match the reduced circulating MAIT cell frequencies seen in our hospitalized subjects, together

198

suggesting that a lymphopenic state which occurs in severe COVID-19 impacts MAIT cells, consistent

199

with other reports (25-27, 38).

200

In a final experiment, we sought to characterize MAIT cell transcriptomes by sex in the BALF and NPS

201

datasets and determine whether these cells resembled  and  phenotypes we identified in circulating

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.01.407148; this version posted December 1, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

202

MAIT cells. Cluster analysis was not warranted here given low cell numbers in these datasets. Instead,

203

we leveraged gene modules derived from our respective  and  clusters of circulating MAIT cells.

204

We found that MAIT cells in BALF and NPS data were largely skewed toward the  module, with

205

minimal sex differences (Fig. S7A). However, when we directly examined differentially expressed

206

genes (the DEGs between sex, we were able to detect sex differences associated with  and 

207

phenotypes. Specifically, in BALF, we found increased IL7R expression in females (Fig. 4J) and other

208

IL-7 signaling associated genes (CISH and SOCS1) (Fig. 4K). Given the critical role of this signaling in

209

T cell survival, we explored additional pathway genes, finding that female MAIT cells had upregulated

210

anti-apoptotic genes (BCL2 and FOXP1) and downregulated pro-apoptotic genes (BAX and CASP3)

211

(Fig. S7, B and C). Also observed in female cells was upregulated anti-proliferative genes (CDKN1B

212

and BTG2) (Fig. S7D). These patterns matched MAIT gene changes in our PBMC dataset. We were

213

able to find other sex differences, including increased expression of several transcription factors (KLF2,

214

MYC, and CEBPD) (Fig. 4L). Conversely, male cells had higher expression of CCL2 (Fig. 4 M), which

215

has been linked to COVID-19 immunopathology (39). In short, our results infer sex differences at the

216

qualitative level in COVID-19, with female MAIT cells possessing a pro-survival and immunologically

217

active phenotype.

218

DISCUSSION

219

Despite the knowledge of sex differences in the immune response as an underlying factor in COVID-19

220

disease outcomes, the sexual dimorphic responses of MAIT cells, an unconventional T cell population

221

deemed important in this disease, remained unknown. We now demonstrate that MAIT cells in females

222

are quantitatively and qualitatively more robust in the SARS-CoV-2 setting, potentially helping

223

understand the immunological reasons for reduced COVID-19 susceptibility in females.

224

Our finding that MAIT recruitment to airway tissues may be more robust in COVID-19 females was

225

aided first by our observation of higher circulating MAIT cell frequencies in females in the healthy

226

setting. This difference can be explained by the rate of physiological aging-related attrition of MAIT cells

227

that is substantially less pronounced in female blood (40-42). The resultant higher frequencies in

228

circulation enabled us to readily uncover the precipitous percentage drop we saw with MAIT cells

229

relative to exposed/infected females. In trying to elucidate the potential cause of this drop, we

230

considered two possible scenarios: 1) lymphopenia and 2) extravasation, which are not necessarily

231

mutually exclusive. For the former, it is accepted that lymphopenia is associated with severe COVID-19

232

infections (24, 32, 43, 44), which which agrees with our observations in our hospitalized group

233

(comprised of 77.8% intensive care patients). Similarly, lymphopenia could partially explain the

234

reduction in MAIT cells described by Jouan et al in a study of male-dominated samples from critically ill

235

COVID-19 patients (27), though extravasation also likely occurred. In our study, however, we

236

demonstrated that circulating MAIT frequencies drop in our infected outpatient group. As these subjects

237

were not critically ill, our findings point to extravasation as a major reason for the sex-specific drop in

238

circulating MAIT frequencies. The same pattern may also exist in several other studies (25, 26, 35). For

239

example, while Parrot et al (25) also demonstrated that circulating MAIT cells are reduced in moderate

240

COVID-19 patients relative to healthy subjects in aggregated data, it is possible that the healthy female

241

frequencies contributed to reaching the statistical difference. Further supporting our conclusion, we

242

were able to show with publicly available scRNA-seq data from COVID-19 BALF samples (36) that

243

females in that study had an increased MAIT cell percentage relative to males, allowing us to conclude

244

that MAIT cell extravasation during COVID-19 may be quantitatively more robust in females.

245

Our results also suggest that MAIT cells may be qualitatively superior in females, with respect to anti-

246

viral immune activity in COVID-19. Leading us to this conclusion, our scRNA-seq analysis of patient

247

PBMCs revealed two distinct clusters of MAIT cells, referred to here as MAIT and MAIT. The 

248

cluster was enriched for various immune pathways, such as IFN- signaling, inferring a capacity for

249

anti-viral immune function. In contrast, the  cluster was enriched for cell stress and apoptosis

250

pathways, inferring a frail phenotype roughly similar to a previously described population of double

251

negative MAIT cells (45, 46). We showed in the healthy setting that MAIT cells in females were skewed

252

toward the  cluster, whereas males comprised the  cluster. Though from these results it could be

253

presumed that the  cluster should be overrepresented in COVID-19 airways of females, this was not

254

the case in the BALF. However, we reasoned that such a finding would be very difficult to make for two

255

main reasons. First, extravasated MAIT cells with an -phenotype would be restricted to the early wave

256

of recruitment, since circulating cells are almost completely skewed to the  module in exposed/infected

257

individuals. Second, a certain level of transcriptional reprogramming would occur upon immune cell

258

extravasation into the tissue and potentially again upon accessing the alveolar space. Still, we were

259

able to show in BALF that certain gene patterns remained consistent with the  signature in females

260

versus males. In addition, our finding that female BALF samples had quantitatively more MAIT cells

261

gives further credence that differences revealed in blood would likewise extend to the tissue.

262

In summary, we conclude that MAIT cells in females are quantitatively and qualitatively distinct from

263

males and we surmise that this distinction provides a protective advantage in the SARS-CoV-2 setting.

264

Indeed, females in general tend to have elevated frequencies of circulating MAIT cells, also gleaned by

265

large independent studies with European (40), South Korean (41) and Chinese populations (42).

266

Further supporting this argument, it has now been recorded that adult COVID-19 fatality rates trend

267

less in females at all ages across 39 different countries, including in North America, Europe, and Asia

268

where MAIT cell frequencies trend higher in females (2). These points also argue against the possibility

269

that an immunologically more robust MAIT cell response has a net negative effect, for example, by

270

immunological misfiring (20) or cytokine storm related immunopathology (39). However, one open

271

question that our findings now raise is whether males in our study, which had greater circulating CD8+

272

memory T cells, would instead have an advantage in the reinfection setting or following vaccination.

273

Future studies are needed to explore this question, and to better understand sex differences in MAIT

274

cells both in general and in COVID-19.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

276

Ethics statement

277

This study and relevant protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Duke University

278

Health System (DUHS) ?. All procedures were performed in accordance with the Declaration of

279

Helsinki, applicable regulations, and local policies.

280

Participants in this study

281

In-patients (hospitalized) and out-patients (infected) with confirmed infection of SARS-CoV-2 were

282

identified through the DUHS and enrolled into the Molecular and Epidemiological Study of Suspected

283

Infection (MESSI, Pro00100241). The RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed at either the

284

North Carolina State Laboratory of Public Health or at clinical laboratories of the DUHS. The exposed

285

group, who closely contacted with COVID-19 patients, presented negative PCR test and negative

286

serology test during longitudinally sampling from the first visit to at least 2 months after, typically 0, 7,

287

14, and 28 days relative to enrollment. Initial severity scores of individuals were recorded through a

288

self-reporting survey on 38 defined symptoms related to COVID-19 plus “other” when enrolled. The

289

exposed group (average score = 9.71) showed a lower severity scores compared with infected (out-

290

patients) group (average score = 18.16). The hospitalized patients presented severe disease symptoms

291

with breath difficulty, cough, fever or chest pain when enrolled, and 77.8% of them for this study

292

required intensive care unit (ICU) care. All COVID-19 patients were also longitudinally sampled with

293

serology test from enrollment to convalescent phase. Healthy donors were enrolled in 2019 (Duke IRB

294

Protocol Pro00009459) with no diagnosis or symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or other respiratory

295

illness. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects or legally authorized representatives.

296

Patient Demographics are summarized in Table 1.

297

Collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.01.407148; this version posted December 1, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

298

PBMC cells were prepared using Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient method. Briefly, peripheral whole

299

blood was collected in EDTA vacutainer tubes and processed within 8 hours. Blood was diluted 1:2 in

300

PBS then layered onto the Ficoll-Hypaque in 50 ml conical tube and centrifuged at 420g for 25 min.

301

Buffy coat was collected and washed with D-PBS by centrifugation at 400g for 10min. Cell pellets were

302

resuspended in D-PBS and washed again. PBMCs were assessed for viability and cell count using Vi-

303

Cell automated cell counter (Beckman-Coulter). PBMCs were adjusted to 10x106 cells/ml in

304

cryopreservation media (90% FBS, 10% DMSO) and aliquoted into cryopreservation vials on ice. Cells

305

underwent controlled freezing at -80℃ using CoolCell LX (BioCision) for 12-24 hours, then transferred

306

to liquid nitrogen vapor phase.

307

Sample processing for flow cytometry and single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq)

308

Counts and cell viability of thawed PBMCs were measured by Countess II after a wash with DMEM

309

10% FBS. The cell viability of hospitalized patients ranged from 70-80% whereas all other samples

310

exceeded 80% viability. An additional dead cell removal step (Miltenyi Biotec) was conducted on

311

hospitalized PBMC samples prior to aliquot for scRNA-seq. To perform scRNA-seq, 200,000 cells per

312

sample were aliquoted, spun down, resuspended in 30 μl PBS supplemented with 0.04% BSA and

313

0.2U/ μl RNase inhibitor and counted using Countess II.

314

Panel and Staining for Flow Cytometry

315

Approximately 0.5-2 x 106 cells per cryopreserved sample were stained for flow cytometry analysis.

316

Antibody titrations used in this study were previously established by Cytek Biosciences with slight

317

modifications (see Table S2 for flow panel information). All staining procedures were performed at room

318

temperature. PBMCs were stained with live/dead Blue (Thermofisher) for 15 min, washed with FACS-

319

EDTA buffer and spun down at 1500 rpm for 5min. Samples were resuspended with Brilliant Stain

320

Buffer Plus (BD Biosciences) and sequentially stained with anti-CCR7 for 10 min, the chemokine

321

receptor mix for 5 min, anti-TCR gamma/delta for 10 min and the surface receptor mix for 30 min. After

322

incubation, PBMCs were washed with FACS-EDTA buffer and spun down at 1500 rpm for 5min.

323

Samples were fixed with 1% PFA in PBS for 20 min, spun down and resuspended in FACS-EDTA

324

buffer.

325

36-color Full Spectrum Flow Cytometry

326

Samples were acquired using a four-laser Cytek Aurora Spectral Flow Cytometry System. Single color

327

controls for spectral unmixing were done with PBMCs from healthy control blood and UltraComp

328

eBeads (ThermoFisher). Raw data were unmixed and further analyzed using either FlowJo for manual

329

gating or Omiq (https://www.omiq.ai) for clustering visualization and analysis.

330

High-dimensional data analysis of flow cytometry data

331

Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and FlowSOM clustering analyses were

332

performed on Omiq (https://www.omiq.ai), using equal random sampling of 3000 live CD45+ singlets.

333

from each FCS file. The UMAP plot was generated with the parameters of 15 neighbors and 0.4

334

minimum distance. All markers in flow panel were used for analysis except live/dead and CD45.

335

ScRNA-seq using 10x Genomics platform

336

10x Genomics Single Cell 5’ v1 chemistry was used to generate Gel Bead-In Emulsions (GEM), and

337

perform post GEM-RT cleanup, cDNA amplification, as well as library construction. An agilent DNA

338

ScreenTape assay was used for quality control. Libraries were pooled and sequenced to saturation or

339

20,000 unique reads per cell on average using an Illumina NovaSeq6000 with 150-bp paired-end

340

reads.

341

Processing and quality control of scRNA-seq

342

Raw sequencing data were initially processed with 10x Genomics Cell Ranger pipelines (V3.1.0).

343

Briefly, BCL files were demultiplexed to generate FASTQ files. FASTQ files were aligned with STAR

344

aligner to the human genome reference GRCh38 from Ensemble database. Feature barcode

345

processing and UMI counting were then performed according to the standard workflow. (QC summary

346

after sequencing). The following criteria were applied as quality control of single cells from all individual

347

samples. Cells that had fewer than 1000 UMI counts or 500 genes, as well as cell that had greater than

348

10% of mitochondrial genes were removed from further analysis. Genes that were expressed by fewer

349

than 10 cells were also excluded. After filtering, a total of 424,080 cells with 18,765 gene features were

350

kept for the downstream analysis.

351

Dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis

352

The filtered gene-barcode matrix was analyzed using Seurat 3 (28). All the procedures were conducted

353

with the default parameters unless otherwise specified. Briefly, data were first normalized using log

354

transformation and adjusted with a scale factor of 10,000. The top 2,000 variable genes were identified,

355

and percentages of mitochondrial genes were regressed out when scaling data. Principle component

356

analysis (PCA) was performed using these top variable genes, and top 25 principle components (PCs)

357

were selected for graph-based clustering with Shared Nearest Neighbor (SNN) and visualization in

358

UMAP. The resolution was set to 0.35 to identify major immune cell subsets in PBMCs. Sub-clustering

359

of CD161hi T cells (21,610 cells) was also performed using the analytic pipeline mentioned above with

360

two modifications: top 10 PCs were used, and the resolution was set to 0.1 to identify MAIT cell

361

clusters.

362

Differential gene expression analysis

363

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using Seurat 3 (FindAllMarkers or FindMarkers

364

Functions) with either ‘wilcox’ for all cluster markers or ‘DESeq2’ (47). Randomly downsampled data

365

with 100,000 cells were used to find all markers of PBMC clusters. A gene was considered significant

366

with adjusted p-value or false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. DEGs results of all PBMCs and MAIT cells

367

are listed in Table S3 and S4.

368

Pathway enrichment analysis

369

Top 100 DEGs of MAIT clusters were used for pathway enrichment analysis using Reactome Pathway

370

Database (https://reactome.org). A pathway was considered significantly over-presented with FDR

371

< 0.05. The full pathway enrichment results are summarized in Table S5.

372

Inference of ligand-receptor interactions between T cells and monocytes

373

Ligand-receptor interactions between T cells and monocytes were inferred using CellPhoneDB (33).

374

PBMC scRNA-seq data were randomly downsampled to 50,000 cells and T and monocyte clusters

375

were extracted based on the expression of their lineage markers. CellPhoneDB was with default

376

parameters (https://github.com/Teichlab/cellphonedb). The inferred interactions are considered

377

significant when p-value < 0.05.

378

Integration of BALF and NPS dataset

379

Publicly available scRNA-seq data of BALF (36) and of NPS (37) were downloaded and processed

380

using Seurat 3 as previously described (28). All T cell clusters, were extracted from both dataset and

381

integrated via Single Cell Transform (SCT) method in Seurat 3. Top 3,000 variable features were

382

selected for the integration. Dimensionality reduction was conducted using PCA and UMAP embedding

383

of the top 100 PCs. Clusters were visualized at a resolution of 0.8 after constructing a SNN graph using

384

the first 50 PCs.

385

Calculations of the feature scores in MAIT cells

386

The DEGs between MAIT1 and MAIT2 were used to generate their feature scores as previously

387

described (48). The feature scores were calculated using AddModuleScore function in Seurat 3. MAIT

388

cells from different single cell dataset were plotted with MAIT1 feature and MAIT2 feature for

389

visualization.

391

Data normality and homogeneity of variance were assessed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and

392

Bartlett's test, respectively. Due to the distribution and variance of human data, non-parametric

393

statistical tests were favorably used throughout this study unless otherwise specified. Mann Whitney U

394

test was used for two-group comparisons, and Kruskal-Wallis with post hoc Dunn's test was used for

395

comparisons of three groups and more. Spearman’s correlation efficiency was used to quantify the

396

correlation of the ranked disease severity (from healthy as 1, to hospitalized as 4). To adjust p-values

397

for multiple hypothesis testing, FDR correction was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure

398

when appropriate. Two-tailed tests were used unless otherwise specified. A p-value or FDR < 0.05 is

399

consider statistically significant. Graphical data of quantifications presented throughout are expressed

400

as the means ± SEMs and were plotted using Graphpad Prism 8. Other graphs in this study were

401

generated using either the corresponding analytic packages or R package ggplot2.
