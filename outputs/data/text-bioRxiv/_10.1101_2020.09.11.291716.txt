HIGHLIGHTS
Focused CRISPR screens targeting host factors in the SARS-CoV-2 interactome were
performed for SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43 coronaviruses.
Focused interactome CRISPR screens achieve higher resolution compared to genomewide screens, leading to the identification of critical factors missed by the latter.
Parallel CRISPR screens against multiple coronaviruses uncover host factors and
pathways with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles.
The number of host proteins that interact with a viral bait protein is not proportional to the
number of functional interactors.
Novel SARS-CoV-2 host factors are expressed in relevant cell types in the human airway.
SUMMARY
The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has devastated the global economy and claimed
nearly one million lives, presenting an urgent global health crisis. To identify host factors
required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses, we designed a
focused high-coverage CRISPR-Cas9 library targeting 332 members of a recently
published SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome. We leveraged the compact nature of this
library to systematically screen four related coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63,
HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2) at two physiologically relevant temperatures (33 ºC and
37 ºC), allowing us to probe this interactome at a much higher resolution relative to
genome scale studies. This approach yielded several new insights, including unexpected

virus and temperature specific differences in Rab GTPase requirements and GPI anchor

cholesterol homeostasis. This coronavirus essentiality catalog could inform ongoing drug

INTRODUCTION
The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has claimed the lives of
nearly one million people worldwide and remains uncontrolled in several countries,
presenting an urgent global health crisis. Coronaviruses are positive-sense RNA viruses
that infect a variety of vertebrate hosts. Seasonal coronaviruses endemic in humans
cause mild, common cold-like symptoms. In recent years, however, novel coronavirus
strains circulating in animal reservoirs have spilled over into the human population
causing severe disease. Three notable coronavirus outbreaks in the 21st century include
SARS-CoV in 2003, MERS-CoV in 2012, and SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019. Although the
spread of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was limited, SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of
COVID-19, remains widespread. With three known spillover events in recent history, this
virus family has proven its potential to cross species, spread rapidly and take numerous
lives.

The urgency of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has advanced coronavirus research
at unprecedented speed. Two groups performed genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens to
identify host factors required by SARS-CoV-2 (Heaton et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2020) with
the hope that these screens would not only uncover the biology underlying this virus, but
also identify druggable host factors that could be targeted to prevent virus spread or
lessen disease. Other groups conducted drug repurposing screens using compound
libraries enriched with FDA-approved or clinical phase drug candidates to identify off-theshelf interventions (Dittmar et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). A complementary strategy to
these screens is to nominate candidate host factors that are predicted to interact with viral
proteins through immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS) of affinity tagged viral
proteins. Indeed, one of the earliest discovery-based SARS-CoV-2 reports to appear in
press was a study that aimed to map the SARS-CoV-2 host protein interactome using this
technique (Gordon et al., 2020). This dataset highlighted potential targets to explore for
drug repurposing based on the hypothesis that host proteins that directly or indirectly bind
SARS-CoV-2 proteins are more likely to be required to support infection or spread relative
to the rest of the proteome. Similar protein interactome studies in different contexts and
with varying degrees of overlap between datasets soon followed (Stukalov et al., 2020).
While there is a pressing need to better understand SARS-CoV-2 biology and identify
potential therapeutic targets, it is also critical to obtain and interpret this knowledge in the
broader context of coronavirus biology to prepare for potential future outbreaks. We
therefore aimed to use CRISPR-Cas9 technology to interrogate SARS-CoV-2 host factor
requirements in a broader context that included additional members of the coronavirus
family.

CRISPR-Cas9 forward genetics and data from IP-MS studies can be combined in a highcoverage hypothesis-driven sgRNA screening campaign (Kelly et al., 2020). Focused
libraries offer several advantages: 1) increased coverage (smaller libraries allow
interrogation of many sgRNAs per gene, thereby lowering the rate of false-negatives), 2)
increased resolution (smaller libraries ensure higher screen representation at every point
of the screen), and 3) a wider range of screening conditions (smaller libraries are more
compatible with highly parallel testing of multiple technical and biological conditions)
(DeWeirdt et al., 2020; Doench, 2018; Parnas et al., 2015).
In this study, we leveraged the power of high resolution pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screens
by generating and screening a focused sgRNA library targeting 332 host proteins
identified by Gordon et al. as high-confidence SARS-CoV-2 protein interactors (Gordon
et al., 2020). This focused approach allowed us to interrogate 10 sgRNAs per gene,
thereby achieving near-saturating coverage of candidate targets. Furthermore, the
reduced library complexity allowed us to systematically expand our screening efforts
across a panel of four related human coronaviruses representing both alpha- (HCoV229E and HCoV-NL63) and beta-coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2). We
conducted these screens at 33 ºC and 37 ºC, consistent with the native environment of
the upper and lower airway, respectively. This systematic approach allowed us to uncover
host proteins that are required for infection by all four tested human coronaviruses.
Several of these host factors may serve as suitable targets for developing pancoronavirus therapeutics. Furthermore, we uncovered previously unappreciated
differences in host factor requirements among human coronaviruses, which could be
leveraged for designing strain-specific therapeutic strategies. Overall, our study highlights

the power of high-coverage CRISPR-Cas9 screens for systematic identification of host
factors required for coronavirus infection and serves as a resource for efforts aimed at
developing novel strategies to treat COVID-19, seasonal coronavirus infections, and
perhaps future pandemic strains.
RESULTS
A focused CRISPR-Cas9 screen functionally validates host protein members of a
SARS-CoV-2 host protein interactome
In a recent study, 26 of the 29 known SARS-CoV-2 proteins were individually expressed
in HEK293T cells and immunoprecipitated to identify interacting host proteins (Gordon et
al., 2020). After stringent filtering, 332 high-confidence host protein interactors were
nominated. Here, we designed a custom-made sgRNA library and performed a series of
CRISPR-Cas9 forward genetic screens to determine which of these 332 host proteins
may be required for SARS-CoV-2 infection and virus-induced cytopathogenicity.
We constructed a lentiviral transfer plasmid library encoding 3,944 sgRNAs designed to
disrupt all 332 human genes identified in the abovementioned SARS-CoV-2 interactome
(Figure 1A). The library includes 10 sgRNAs targeting each gene, 314 safe-targeting
sgRNAs (which cut the genome at non-genic regions (Morgens et al., 2017)), and 310
sgRNAs targeting genes essential for cell survival or proliferation (Hart et al., 2017;
Michlits et al., 2020). We used this library to perform a pooled CRISPR-Cas9 gene
disruption screen in Huh-7.5 hepatoma cells stably expressing Cas9 (Huh-7.5-Cas9)
(Figure 1B). Huh-7.5 cells were chosen because they express the SARS-CoV-2 cellular
receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as well as transmembrane serine

protease 2 (TMPRSS2), which is involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry (Figure S1A) (Hoffmann
et al., 2020). Furthermore, these cells express 329/332 (99%) of the host proteins in the
SARS-CoV-2 interactome at levels similar to highly susceptible Calu-3 cells (Figure S1A)
(Wyler et al., 2020). Importantly, we confirmed that Huh-7.5 cells were readily infected
and displayed virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) by multiple coronaviruses, including
SARS-CoV-2, thereby validating these cells as a robust system for studying members of
the Coronaviridae family (Figure S1B).
Next, we performed a series of genetic screens by transducing Huh-7.5-Cas9 cells with
the SARS-CoV-2 interactome sgRNA library followed by puromycin selection and
expansion for one week prior to SARS-CoV-2 challenge. To identify potential
temperature-dependent differences in host factor requirements, SARS-CoV-2 selection
screens were performed at two temperatures, 33 ºC and 37 ºC, to mimic the temperatures
of the upper and lower airway, respectively (V’kovski et al., 2020). Library-transduced
cells that survived SARS-CoV-2 infection were harvested after seven (33 ºC) and eleven
(37 ºC) days followed by genomic DNA isolation and screen deconvolution via next
generation sequencing (Methods). In this context, cells transduced with sgRNAs targeting
host factors required for viral infection or virus-induced CPE should survive and enrich
within the infected population while cells expressing safe-targeting sgRNAs or sgRNAs
targeting genes inconsequential to virus infection are expected to die and deplete over
time. Similarly, cells transduced with sgRNAs targeting genes essential for cell survival
should deplete independently of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The overall technical performance of these genetic screens was excellent (Figure S1CF). We confirmed that 3,921/3,944 (99.4%) of sgRNAs were recovered from the plasmid

library and that all screen libraries were sequenced to saturation (Figure S1C).
Correlation analyses demonstrated that biological replicates for each condition clustered
together and shared a high correlation coefficient (≥ .97), as expected (Figure S1D).
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, which measure the technical
performance of genetic screens based on the degree to which the screen can distinguish
between negative control (safe-targeting) and positive control (essential gene-targeting)
sgRNAs, were excellent (Figure S1E-F). Of note, incorporating safe-targeting and
essential gene-targeting sgRNAs allows for better internal calibration and effect size
estimation of CRISPR-based genetic screens (Methods). Specifically, we used these
built-in controls to establish a gene essentiality (beta) score (Li et al., 2015), which allowed
us to first stratify interactome targets based on their effects on cellular fitness under
“mock” (uninfected) conditions followed by identifying high-confidence gene “hits” in
infected cells (Methods). Genes with beta scores similar to essential genes (which
influence cell survival with or without infection) may be confounded by effects on cellular
fitness whereas genes with beta scores similar to safe-targeting sgRNAs (which only
influence survival during viral infection) are more likely to be true positives. Using these
parameters, we identified 36 and 43 genes that significantly influenced SARS-CoV-2induced cell death at 33 ºC and 37 ºC, respectively (Figure 1C-D and Table S1C, E). Of
these, 21 (33 ºC) and 23 (37 ºC) genes scored as potential host factors that promote
SARS-CoV-2-induced cell death (purple dots in Figure 1C-D), while 21 (33 ºC) and 20
(37 ºC) genes scored as putative antagonists of the virus life cycle (orange dots in Figure
1C-D). In contrast, safe-targeting and essential gene-targeting sgRNAs behaved similarly
across mock and SARS-CoV-2 conditions (blue and red dots in Figure 1C-D,

respectively). These results suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 host protein interactome is
composed of functionally relevant factors that play critical roles during the life cycle of this
virus.
As shown in Figures 1C and 1D, we noted significant enrichment in sgRNAs targeting
sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP),
heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase 1 (HS2ST1), eukaryotic translation initiation factor
4E type 2 (EIF4E2), the Rab family of small GTPases (e.g., RAB2A, RAB10, and RAB14),
members of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) tethering complex
(e.g., VPS39 and VPS11), and ER Membrane Protein Complex Subunit 1 (EMC1).
Additional significantly enriched genes are highlighted in purple in Figures 1C and 1D.
These results indicate that these SARS-CoV-2 protein interactors are essential for virus
infection or virus-induced cell death. In contrast, we observed negative enrichment in
mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit (MRPS) genes (e.g., MRPS2, MRPS5,
MRPS25, and MRPS27), suggesting that loss of these genes sensitize cells to direct or
indirect virus-induced cell death. Additional significantly depleted genes are highlighted
in orange in Figures 1C and 1D.
We also observed hits that were common to screens performed at either 33 ºC or 37 ºC
(Figure 1E), as well as hits that were specific to one of the two temperatures. An intriguing
outcome is the apparent differential requirement for two Rab GTPases, RAB2A and
RAB14, which appear to be essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection and virus-induced CPE
at 37 ºC but not at 33 ºC. In contrast, members of the HOPS complex (VPS11 and VPS39)
and proteins involved in glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis (PIGO

and GPAA1) appear to be required at 33 ºC but not at 37 ºC (Figure 1E). These findings
may reflect differences in the SARS-CoV-2 entry pathway at 33 ºC and 37 ºC.
Lastly, we found that positively selected hits were typically enriched in the region of safetargeting sgRNAs, while negatively selected hits tended to be enriched in the region of
control genes with deleterious effects (Figure 1E).
In conclusion, our SARS-CoV-2 interactome screen identified a compendium of host
genes that can be disrupted without affecting cell viability in the absence of infection, yet
seem to play essential roles during SARS-CoV-2 induced CPE (Figure 1C-E). Such
genes could represent excellent candidates for the development of anti-SARS-CoV-2
therapeutics.
Multiple coronaviruses require both obligate and likely dispensable SARS-CoV-2
host factors for infection
Viruses within the same family can have both shared and specific host factor
requirements. Functionally distinguishing these requirements is critical to gain a complete
understanding of virus-host biology and, on a practical level, can help identify targets for
pan-viral therapies. Towards these goals, we expanded our SARS-CoV-2 interactome
CRISPR-Cas9 screening campaign by performing complementary screens using three
additional human coronaviruses: HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43. To
visualize the degree of enrichment in genes that scored in the SARS-CoV-2 screens
described above, we plotted the cumulative distribution of absolute z-scores for all five
screens (Figure 2A). Each of these screens were significantly enriched in the subset of
genes that scored in the initial SARS-CoV-2 screens as compared to the complete library.

These screens also identified Rab GTPases, components of the HOPS complex, and
EMC1 as host factors required for coronavirus infection and virus-induced CPE (Figure
2B-D). In addition to hits common among different coronaviruses, several strain-specific
hits were also identified (Figure 2E). For example, HCoV-OC43, for which there is
currently no protein receptor described and entry has been associated with binding to 9O-acetylated sialic acids (Hulswit et al., 2019), displayed a unique requirement for GPI
anchor biosynthesis as evidenced by the fact that GPAA1, PIGO, and PIGS scored as
significant hits in the screen (Figure 2D and Figure S4A).
In addition to sgRNAs that enrich in virus-infected cell populations (suggesting the genes
targeted by these sgRNAs support virus infection), we also identified sgRNAs that were
depleted in virus-infected cultures (suggesting the genes targeted by these sgRNAs could
have an antiviral function). For example, Mindbomb 1 (MIB1), an E3 ubiquitin-protein
ligase, was specifically depleted in the context of infection with all four viruses. Although
MIB1 disruption was deleterious in both mock infected and virus infected cells, MIB1
disruption was consistently more toxic in the context of virus infection. MIB1 is known to
play a role in 'Lys-63'-linked polyubiquitination of TBK1 kinase, which is thought to
mediate its activation (Li et al., 2011). Consistent with a potential role in this pathway,
sgRNAs targeting TBK1 were negatively enriched in HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43
screens (Figure 2C-D). This might suggest a role for MIB1 and TBK1, a signal integrator
of multiple RIG-like receptors (RLRs) and positive regulator of IRF3, in establishing an
antiviral state that controls coronavirus infection. This could explain why, in the absence
of MIB1 and TBK1, cells are more susceptible to virus-induced CPE.
Functional interactors are not proportionally distributed between bait proteins

We next asked how the functional hits we identified related to the viral bait proteins with
which they interact. To visualize functional and network relationships, we overlaid our
CRISPR screening results from all viral screens in this study onto a bait-centric
interactome map (Figure 3A). The distribution of functional hits across different bait
proteins was apparently non-random; instead, we observed that certain bait proteins
appeared to be enriched in functional hits.
We subsequently explored whether the number of host protein interactions for a given
bait protein was predictive of the percentage of functional interactors (Figure 3B). There
was no evident correlation between the number of predicted host protein binding partners
of a given viral protein and the number of functional interactors. We found that some viral
baits that interact with many host proteins (e.g., Orf8 and Nsp13) have relatively few
functional interactors, whereas others (e.g., Nsp7, Nsp8, and Orf9c) have many. Overall,
most of the functional hits identified in our pan-coronavirus screens seem to be required
for SARS-CoV-2 infection. This was expected given that our screens were based on a
SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome. We were surprised, however, to find that there are
SARS-CoV-2 protein interactors that are essential for one or more of the other
coronaviruses but not essential for SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., DDX10, RPL36, GNG5, and
CYB5B; Figure 2E, 3A). Altogether, these data suggest that the relationship between
physical interactome screens and functional genetic screens is not strictly concordant.
Some viral proteins may interact with redundant factors whose depletion is compensated.
However, 27% of SARS-CoV-2 interacting proteins functionally influenced the outcome
of infection, suggesting that this high-confidence interactome is substantially enriched in
functional host factors.

DISCUSSION
Host:pathogen

protein:protein

interaction

(PPI)

networks

derived

from

immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS) data have proven valuable for
illustrating the complex nexus between viral and cellular proteins (Gordon et al., 2020;
Sadegh et al., 2020; Stukalov et al., 2020). PPI networks can predict hundreds of potential
interactions; however, secondary validation of each interaction is often a labor-intensive
process. Moreover, it is not possible to assign functional significance to any particular
bona fide interaction based on co-purification or co-immunoprecipitation alone in part due
to possible artifacts caused by overexpression outside of the viral context. Functional
experiments are therefore needed to assess the biological significance of each host
protein node in the network.
We probed a SARS-CoV-2 PPI network consisting of 332 high-confidence host factors by
systematically screening multiple coronaviruses using a novel, high-density, pooled
sgRNA library. First, we interrogated the functional role of each predicted member of the
network in the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which allowed us to identify
host factors that appear to be dispensable for Huh-7.5 proliferation but play a functional
role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the predicted interactome, we were able to assign a
functional role for 87/332 (26%) unique genes. This finding is in contrast to two recent
preprint studies that performed genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screens in VeroE6 and
ACE2-reconstituted A549 cells, which failed to identify significant enrichment of the same
PPI network (Heaton et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2020). We speculate that this difference may
be due in part to well-established advantages of focused screens, including 1) improved
signal-to-noise ratios in the absence of sgRNAs targeting genes that are likely to

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.11.291716; this version posted September 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

dominate the screen (e.g., the SARS-CoV-2 cellular receptor, ACE2), 2) increased
coverage by including more sgRNAs per gene (ten vs. four), 3) feasibility of exploring
multiple screening conditions (e.g., different viruses and temperatures), and 4) higher
screen representation (i.e., > 1,500-fold vs. < 750-fold) ((DeWeirdt et al., 2020; Doench,
2018; Parnas et al., 2015)). Thus, by deeply probing individual interactome proteins using
a focused sgRNA library coupled with functional readouts across multiple conditions
allowed us to identify many host factors required for SARS-CoV-2 infection that were
missed in genome-scale CRISPR screens (Heaton et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2020).
While host proteins associated with specific viral bait proteins (e.g., Nsp7, Nsp8, and
Orf9c) appear to be enriched in functionally required host factors, we note that the
greatest degree of co-essentiality was predominantly observed between functionallyrelated host factors instead of between factors associated with the same viral bait protein
(e.g., SCAP and NPC2, both of which are involved in cholesterol homeostasis but interact
with Orf9c and Orf8, respectively). This emphasizes the complementary role played by
IP-MS data and functional genomics in identifying viral proteins that serve as hubs for
multiple host factors that may participate in diverse molecular processes.
In addition to the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 strain, we performed parallel screens for three
seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43), which
allowed us to compare and contrast virus-specific host factor requirements and identify
potential pan-coronavirus host factors. Many genes from the SARS-CoV-2 PPI network
were essential across multiple coronaviruses tested (40/332; 12%), suggesting functional
conservation across host:coronavirus PPIs. Surprisingly, though, we found that some
predicted SARS-CoV-2 interactors appeared not to play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection

but were essential for other coronaviruses (Figure 4A). This may be due to promiscuity
in protein-protein interactions, evolutionary divergence in the functional requirement for a
given host factor, redundant factors (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 might rely on redundant factors
for specific viral life cycle steps while other coronaviruses might rely on a single factor),
or the strict threshold—the ability to survive infection—that must be crossed to score as
a hit in these screens. For example, it is possible that inactivation of specific host factors
impairs SARS-CoV-2 infection to some extent but the virus nevertheless kills the cell.
To illustrate the power and versatility of our screening approach, we discuss below a
specific example of pan-coronavirus and strain-specific host factors uncovered in our
studies. The rest of the screening data can be found in Table S1.
SCAP is a required and druggable SARS-CoV-2 and pan-coronavirus host factor
A central goal of this study was to use a predicted SARS-CoV-2 interactome to identify
host factors that are required for virus infection or virus-induced CPE by multiple
coronaviruses. We identified SCAP as a pan-coronavirus host factor required for all four
of the coronaviruses tested in this study (Figure 4A-C). SCAP regulates lipid and
cholesterol homeostasis by sequestering SREBPs in the ER in the presence of sterols,
thus preventing their transport to the Golgi apparatus in COPII-coated vesicles where
SREBPs are normally activated by proteolytic cleavage and subsequently shuttled to the
nucleus to regulate gene expression (Luo et al., 2020). It is possible that multiple
coronaviruses hijack this transport pathway as part of their life cycle or that coronavirus
infection is not compatible with cell membrane properties in a low cholesterol state.
Interestingly, Niemann–Pick intracellular cholesterol transporter 2 (NPC2) and EMC1

were also enriched across multiple coronavirus screens (Figure 4A-C). NPC2 normally
plays a role in trafficking cholesterol out of lysosomes (Infante et al., 2008), and disruption
of NPC2 could decrease cholesterol availability, which would prevent sequestration of
SREBPs by SCAP and thus, phenocopy SCAP loss of function. EMC1 has been
implicated in the exit of simian virus 40 (SV40) from the ER (Bagchi et al., 2016), in the
infection of many flaviviruses (Marceau et al., 2016; Savidis et al., 2016; Zhang et al.,
2016), and as part of the EMC complex in cholesterol biosynthesis (Volkmar et al., 2019).
SCAP and NPC2 have not been previously identified in other host:pathogen forward
genetic screens; however, an upstream cholesterol transporter, NPC1, was identified as
an essential host factor for Ebola virus (Carette et al., 2011). The SCAP:SREBP complex
is further regulated by oxysterol sensors, including insulin induced gene 2 (INSIG2), which
sequesters SCAP:SREBP in the presence of oxysterols like 25-hydroxycholesterol
(25OHC) (Radhakrishnan et al., 2007). It is intriguing to speculate that oxysterols or direct
SCAP inhibitors, such as fatostatin (Kamisuki et al., 2009) or its derivatives, could have
antiviral properties. Consistent with this possibility, one study showed that 27hydroxycholesterol (27OHC) exerted SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity in VeroE6 cells at 10
µM, and that overall oxysterols were lower in patients with moderate and severe COVID19 symptoms compared to controls (Marcello et al., 2020). Another study showed that
25OHC had potent SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity at similar concentrations (Zang et al.,
2020). These findings are in strong agreement with work from multiple groups that has
demonstrated that 25OHC is a potent inhibitor of many enveloped viruses (Liu et al.,
2013). Importantly, these regulators of lipid and cholesterol homeostasis are all
constitutively expressed in Huh-7.5 cells (Figure 4B), as well as in cells and tissues

known to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Figure S2). Collectively, these results nominate
regulators of lipid and cholesterol homeostasis as potential critical regulators of
coronavirus infection and further suggest that direct targeting of SCAP may be a potential
pan-coronavirus therapeutic strategy.
Differential requirement of Rab GTPases among members of the Coronaviridae
family
Another central goal of this study was to probe the SARS-CoV-2 interactome across
multiple coronaviruses to identify host factors required for virus infection or virus-induced
CPE by specific strains (e.g., SARS-CoV-2-specific factors that are dispensable for
HCoV-NL63,

HCoV-229E,

and/or

HCoV-OC43

infection).

By

comparing

two

temperatures and four coronaviruses in parallel, we uncovered striking heterogeneity in
the requirement for different Rab GTPases, which varied by coronavirus and temperature
(Figure 4A-B, D). Specifically, we identified a Rab GTPase module consisting of RAB2A
and RAB7A that appears to be critical for infection and virus-induced CPE by HCoV-229E,
HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-NL63, but that seems to be partially dispensable for SARS-CoV2 infection, at least at lower temperatures (Figure 4A). In accordance with these results,
we identified the RAB10 and RAB14 GTPases as critical SARS-CoV-2-specific host
factors while RAB5C appears to be specific for HCoV-OC43 infection (Table S1). This
differential requirement is not due to differences in basal expression levels of Rab
GTPases, as mRNAs for all five Rab proteins are uniformly expressed in Huh-7.5 cells,
as well as in cells and tissues known to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 4B, Figure
S2). These results suggest that different coronaviruses may hijack specific Rab GTPase
modules in host cells to carry out their infectious cycle, raising the possibility that targeting

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.11.291716; this version posted September 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

these modules could have therapeutic benefits. Furthermore, given the central role that
Rab GTPases play in orchestrating complex intracellular trafficking, the observation that
SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63, which both utilize ACE2 for cellular entry (Hoffmann et
al., 2020; Hofmann et al., 2005), have different requirements for Rab GTPases suggests
that even coronaviruses that engage the same cellular receptor may differ in their entry
pathways in a context-dependent manner. Moreover, the temperature-specific
differences we observed among the same virus (SARS-CoV-2) raises the intriguing
hypothesis that there may be differences in the infection process across the temperature
gradient spanning the upper and lower airway. Recent studies have nominated additional
SARS-CoV-2 entry factors, including (Gu et al., 2020). One potential explanation for the
temperature-specific differences we observed in entry pathways could be differential use
of entry factors at 33 ºC and 37 ºC. In addition to virus- and temperature-specific
differences in the requirement of Rab GTPases, we found that disruption of GPI anchor
biosynthesis uniquely affected HCoV-OC43 (Figure 4A-B, E), raising the tantalizing
possibility that HCoV-OC43 engages one or more GPI-anchored host factors, potential
receptors, or co-receptors, that facilitate entry upon binding to 9-O-acetylated sialic acids
(Hulswit et al., 2019).
This study leverages the power of CRISPR-Cas9 forward genetic screens to functionally
probe a high-confidence SARS-CoV-2 host protein interactome across multiple
coronaviruses and temperatures. In doing so, our study delineates the complex functional
interplay between the interacting viral and host factors defined by Gordon et al. (Gordon
et al., 2020) and nominates a set of core biological programs that play critical roles during
infection by SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.. We found that a significant fraction

of putative interactors in the SARS-CoV-2 interactome are indeed required for viral
infection and virus-induced CPE by the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 and other endemic
coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43). Interestingly, we identified
one class of host factors that appear to be critical for infection by all coronaviruses tested
(e.g., regulators of cholesterol homeostasis) and other classes of factors that seem to be
required only by specific coronaviruses (e.g., Rab GTPases and GPI-anchoring proteins).
These findings fill an important knowledge gap between predicted and functional virushost interactomes and may help to focus attention on the genes and pathways in the
SARS-CoV-2 interactome that appear to have the greatest functional significance during
early infection steps. More broadly, this study presents a generalizable approach to
interrogate host:pathogen PPI networks with functional genomics. We predict that the
compendium of host factors and pathways described in this work will provide novel
insights into the infection mechanics of SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses, while
simultaneously nominating candidate targets for antiviral strategies.
LIMITATIONS
While our study sheds new light on how host proteins are co-opted during coronavirus
infection, it is not without limitations. As with all pooled CRISPR gene disruption screens,
we expect that functionally redundant genes may not score (Ewen-Campen et al., 2017)).
Additionally, the results of these genetic screens should not be interpreted to validate
specific physical associations, as it is a purely functional readout. Additional biochemical
studies would be necessary to test each predicted interaction. Nevertheless, we identified
robust pan-coronavirus and discrete strain-specific host factors that scored with up to 10
sgRNAs scoring per gene, validating the utility of this near-saturation CRISPR-based

genetic screening approach. We acknowledge that Huh-7.5 cells, which were chosen
based on their unique capacity to support infection by multiple coronaviruses and also
because they constitutively express 324/332 of the SARS-CoV-2 interactome factors, are
different than the HEK293T system used by Gordon et al. to generate the PPI network
probed in this study and are not airway cells. However, this robust and experimentally
tractable system offers a unique advantage to directly compare hard-wired host factor
requirements across multiple viruses in a cell-type- and tissue-type-agnostic manner,
which can then be validated using gold-standard primary cells or animal models. Future
studies will be required to dissect the specific requirement for each member of the PPI
network validated in this study using additional models of coronavirus infection. Another
potential limitation of our study is that the screening strategy is not optimal for assessing
the functionality of host factors beyond their role in modulating cell survival. In other
words, our current experimental set up does not allow for probing the functionality of
interacting proteins or otherwise critical host factors that act in late stages of the viral life
cycle. Furthermore, our approach cannot identify genes that play important roles in
immune modulation and pathogenesis. Lastly, our genetic screens were not genomewide and, consequently, should not be interpreted as a comprehensive catalog of
potential coronavirus host factors. Future studies that employ focused CRISPR-Cas9
libraries targeting other pathways of interest and/or high coverage genome-wide libraries
will undoubtedly extend this catalog of host factors hijacked by human coronaviruses.

To generate stable Cas9-expressing cell lines, we used lentiCas9-Blast (Addgene, cat.
#52962). To express sgRNAs, we used lentiGuidePurov2, a variant of lentiGuide-Puro
(Addgene, cat. #52963) that contains an improved sgRNA scaffold based on Chen et al.
2013 (Chen et al., 2013). For sgRNA cloning, lentiGuidePurov2 was linearized with
BsmBI (NEB) and ligated with BsmBI-compatible annealed and phosphorylated oligos
encoding sgRNAs using high concentration T4 DNA ligase (NEB). All sgRNA sequences
used are listed in Table S1. HIV-1 Gag-Pol and VSV-G plasmid sequences are available
upon request.
Cloning of the Gordon et al. SARS-CoV-2 Human Interactome CRISPR Library
sgRNA sequences (10 per gene) targeting 332 host factor proteins recently shown to
interact with SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Gordon et al., 2020) (Table S1A) were designed
using a combination of the Vienna Bioactivity CRISPR score (Michlits et al., 2020) and
the Broad Institute sgRNA Designer tool (Doench et al., 2016). In addition, a subset of
sgRNAs were hand-picked from the Wang-Sabatini genome-wide libraries (Wang et al.,
2015). We also included 314 safe-targeting sgRNAs (Morgens et al., 2017) and 310
sgRNAs targeting essential genes (Hart et al., 2017; Michlits et al., 2020) for a total of
3,944 sgRNAs. We refer to this library as the ‘Gordon et al. SARS-CoV-2 Human
Interactome CRISPR Library’. Oligo pools were synthesized by Agilent Technologies. The
Gordon et al. SARS-CoV-2 Human Interactome CRISPR Library was cloned into
lentiGuidePurov2 using a modified version of the protocol published by Doench et al
(Doench et al., 2016) to ensure a library representation of > 10,000-fold. Briefly, the oligo
pool was selectively amplified using barcoded forward and reverse primers that append
cloning adapters at the 5’ and 3’ ends of the sgRNA insert (Table S1B), purified using the

QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), and ligated into BsmBI-digested and
dephosphorylated lentiGuidePurov2 using high-concentration T4 DNA ligase (NEB). A
total of 4.8 µg of ligated lentiGuidePurov2 Gordon et al. SARS-CoV-2 Human Interactome
CRISPR Library plasmid DNA was electroporated into Endura electrocompetent cells (1.2
µg per electroporation) (Lucigen), recovered for 1 h at 37 ºC, plated across 20x 15-cm
LB-Carbenicillin plates (Teknova), and incubated at 37 ºC for 16 h. The total number of
bacterial colonies per sub-pool was quantified using serial dilution plates to ensure a
library representation of > 10,000-fold. The next morning, bacterial colonies were scraped
and briefly expanded for 4 h at 37 ºC in 500 ml of LB-Carbenicillin. Plasmid DNA was
isolated using the Plasmid Plus Maxi Kit (Qiagen). To assess sgRNA distribution, we
amplified the sgRNA target region using primers that append Illumina sequencing
adapters on the 5’ and 3’ ends of the amplicon, as well as a random nucleotide stagger
and unique demultiplexing barcode on the 5’ end (Table S1C). Library amplicons were
size-selected on a 2.5% agarose gel, purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit
(Qiagen), and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq instrument (75 nt single end reads).
Cell culture
Lenti-X 293T™ cells (H. sapiens; sex: female) obtained from Takara (cat. #632180) and
Huh-7.5 cells (H. sapiens; sex: male) (Blight et al., 2002) were maintained at 37 °C and
5% CO2 in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Fisher Scientific, cat. #11995065)
supplemented with 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids (NEAA, Fisher Scientific, cat.
#11140076) and 10% hyclone fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone Laboratories, Lot.
#AUJ35777). Both cell lines have tested negative for contamination with mycoplasma.

Lentivirus production
To produce the lentiGuidePurov2 sgRNA lentivirus library, Lenti-X 293TTM cells were
seeded in 25 ml DMEM supplemented with 0.1 mM NEAA and 3% FBS at 6.25 x 106 per
dish in four poly-L-lysine coated p150 dishes. The following day media was removed and
replaced with 20 ml fresh media and each plate was transfected with 15.6 µg
lentiGuidePurov2 plasmid, 7.8 µg VSV-G plasmid, and 11.7 µg HIV Gag-Pol plasmid
using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Fisher Scientific, cat. #11668019) at 2.2 µl per ug DNA ratio
supplemented with PLUS™ Reagent (Fisher Scientific, cat. #11514015) at 4.4 µl per µg
DNA diluted in 6 ml Opti-MEM Reduced Serum Medium (Fisher Scientific, cat.
#51985034). Six hours post transfection, the media was removed and replaced with 20
ml per plate fresh media. Twenty-four hours later media was removed and replaced with
fresh media. The following day lentivirus-containing media was collected, clarified by
centrifugation at 500 g x 5 min, filtered through a 0.22 µM filter (Corning, cat. #431153)
and concentrated ~70-fold overnight at 4 °C using Lenti-XTM concentrator (Takara, cat.
#631232) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Aliquots were stored at -80 °C.
Production and titration of coronavirus stocks
SARS-CoV-2 (strain: USA-WA1/2020) and HCoV-NL63 were obtained from BEI
Resources (NR-52281 and NR-470). HCoV-OC43 was obtained from ZeptoMetrix (cat.
#0810024CF) and HCoV-229E was generously provided by Volker Thiel (University of
Bern). All viruses were amplified at 33 °C in Huh-7.5 cells to generate a P1 stock. To
generate working stocks, Huh-7.5 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of
0.01 plaque forming unit (PFU)/cell (SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43) and 0.1

PFU/cell (HCoV-229E) and incubated at 33 °C until virus-induced CPE was observed.
Supernatants were subsequently harvested, clarified by centrifugation (3,000 g × 10 min)
at 4 dpi (HCoV-229E), 6 dpi (SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-OC43) and 10 dpi (HCoV-NL63), and
aliquots stored at -80 °C.
Viral titers were measured on Huh-7.5 cells by standard plaque assay. Briefly, 500 µL of
serial 10-fold virus dilutions in Opti-MEM were used to infect 4 x 105 cells seeded the day
prior into wells of a 6-well plate. After 90 min adsorption, the virus inoculum was removed,
and cells were overlaid with DMEM containing 10% FBS with 1.2% microcrystalline
cellulose (Avicel). Cells were incubated for 4 days (HCoV-229E), 5 days (SARS-CoV-2,
HCoV-OC43) and 6 days (HCoV-NL63) at 33 °C, followed by fixation with 7%
formaldehyde and crystal violet staining for plaque enumeration. All SARS-CoV-2
experiments were performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory.
To confirm the identity of the viruses, RNA from 200 µl of each viral stock was purified by
adding 800 µl TRIzol™ Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. #15596026) plus 200 µl
chloroform then centrifuged at 12,000 g x 5 min. The upper aqueous phase was moved
to a new tube and an equal volume of isopropanol was added. This was then added to
an RNeasy mini kit column (Qiagen, cat. #74014) and further purified following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Viral stocks were confirmed via next generation sequencing
at the NYU Genome Technology Center using an Illumina stranded TruSeq kit and
omitting the polyA selection step. Libraries were then sequenced by MiSeq Micro (2 x 250
bp paired end reads).
Lentiviral transduction of cell lines

Huh-7.5-Cas9 cells were generated by lentiviral transduction of lentiCas9-Blast followed
by selection and expansion in the presence of 5 µg/ml blasticidin. To deliver the
lentiGuidePurov2 sgRNA library, 3.6 x 107 Huh-7.5-Cas9 cells were transduced by
spinoculation at 1,000 g x 1 h in media containing 4 µg/ml polybrene (Millipore, cat. #TR1003-G) and 20 mM HEPES (Gibco, cat. #15630080) at a MOI = 0.14 to achieve ~1,500fold overrepresentation of each sgRNA. Cells were spinoculated at 3 x 106 cells/well in
12-well plates in 1.5 ml final volume. Six hours post transduction, cells were trypsinized
and transferred to T175 flasks at 6 x 106 cells/flask. Two days later, media was replaced
with fresh media containing 1.5 µg/ml puromycin and expanded for six days prior to
seeding for coronavirus infection.
CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen
Huh-7.5-Cas9 cells transduced with the lentiGuidePurov2 sgRNA library were seeded in
p150 plates at 4.5 x 106 cells/plate in triplicate for each condition (mock, HCoV-229E,
HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and SARS-CoV-2). The following day, the media was
removed and viruses diluted in 10 ml/plate OptiMEM were added to cells. The inocula of
HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and SARS-CoV-2 were supplemented with 1 µg/ml TPCKtreated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. #T1426) increasing the rate of infection. After two
hours on a plate rocker at 37 ºC, 10 ml/plate media was added and plates were moved
to 5% CO2 incubators set to 33 °C or 37 ºC. Coronavirus screens were performed at the
following temperatures and MOIs in PFU/cell: HCoV-229E = 0.05 at 37 ºC; HCoV-NL63
= 0.01 at 33 °C; HCoV-OC43 = 1 at 33 °C; SARS-CoV-2 = 0.25 at 33 °C and 37 ºC. Mock
cells cultured at both temperatures were passaged every 3-4 days and re-seeded at 4.5
x 106 cells/plate. Media was changed on virus infected plates as needed to remove

cellular debris. Mock cells and cells that survived coronavirus infection were harvested
approximately two weeks post infection.
Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated via ammonium acetate salt precipitation if greater
than 1.5 x 106 cells were recovered or using the Monarch Genomic DNA Purification kit
(NEB) if fewer per the manufacturer’s instructions. gDNA concentrations were quantitated
via UV spectroscopy and normalized to 250 ng/µl with 10 mM Tris using a MANTIS Liquid
Handler (Formulatrix). The library was amplified from gDNA by a two-stage PCR
approach. For PCR1 amplification, gDNA samples were divided into 50 ul PCR reactions.
Each well consisted of 25 µl of NEB Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix, 2.5 ul of 10 µM
forward primer Nuc-PCR1_Nextera-Fwd Mix, 2.5 ul of 10 µM reverse primer NucPCR1_Nextera-Rev Mix and 20 µl of gDNA (5 µg each reaction). PCR1 cycling settings:
initial 30 s denaturation at 98 ºC; then 10 s at 98 ºC, 30 s at 65 ºC, 30 s at 72 ºC for 25
cycles; followed by 2 min extension at 72 ºC. PCR1 samples were cleaned up with SPRI
beads and normalized to 20 ng/µl. Each PCR2 reaction consisted of 25 µl of NEB Q5
High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix, 2.5 µl 10 µM Common_PCR2_Fwd primer, and 2.5 ul of 10
µM reverse i7 indexing primer. PCR2 cycling settings: initial 30 s at 98 ºC; then 10 s at
98 ºC, 30 s at 65 ºC, 30 s at 72 ºC for 13 cycles. PCR products were again purified by
SPRI, pooled and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 at the NYU Genome
Technology Center using standard Nextera sequencing primers and 75 cycles.
Analysis of CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screen data
FASTQ files were processed and trimmed to retrieve sgRNA target sequences followed
by enumeration of sgRNAs in the reference sgRNA library file using MAGeCK (Li et al.,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.11.291716; this version posted September 11, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

2014). MAGeCK was also used to determine gene essentiality (beta) using its maximum
likelihood estimation (MLE) algorithm. Z-scores for visualization in the form of heatmaps
were computed using the following approach: for each condition, the log2 fold change
with respect to the initial condition was computed. A natural cubic spline with 4 degrees
of freedom was fit to each pair of infected and control cells and residuals were extracted.
To obtain gene-wise data, the mean residuals for each group of sgRNAs was calculated,
a z-score was computed, and a p-value was determined using a 2-sided normal
distribution test. P-values were combined across screens using Fisher’s sumlog approach
and corrected for multiple testing using the method of Benjamini & Hochberg.
Analysis of RNAseq and scRNAseq data
RNAseq data from Huh-7.5 cells was obtained from GSE64677 (Luna et al., 2015) and
processed using kallisto (Bray et al., 2016) followed by a tximport (Soneson et al., 2015)
transcript-to-gene level transformation and then a limma-Voom approach (Ritchie et al.,
2015) for read normalization. Transcript indices for kallisto were created from FASTA files
from Ensembl release 100 for hg38 for all annotated cDNA and ncRNA transcripts. For
Calu-3 cells, data was obtained from GSE148729 (Wyler et al., 2020). Specifically, count
tables for poly-A selected libraries from bulk RNA sequenced Calu-3 cells were used and
processed with the same limma-Voom read normalization scheme above. Throughout,
Ensembl gene IDs were used to avoid gene symbol misidentifications. For scRNAseq
analysis,

average expression values were plotted per cell type for all high confidence CRISPR hits.
Statistical Analyses
Statistical tests were used as indicated in the figure legends. Generation of plots and
statistical analyses were performed using the R statistical computing environment. Error
bars represent standard deviation, unless otherwise noted. We used Student’s t-test
(unpaired, two-tailed) to assess significance between treatment and control groups, and
to calculate P values. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
