ABSTRACT

The

outcome

of the COVID-19 pandemic

is unknown and is dependent on

a complex

interplay of its pathogenicity, transmissibility and population immunity. In the current study, SARS

coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was investigated

for the

of large

pairing in its genome. This property, termed genome scale ordered RNA structure (GORS) has been

previously associated with host persistence in other positive-strand RNA viruses, potentially through

its shielding effect on viral RNA recognition in the cell. Genomes of SARS-CoV-2 were remarkably

structured, with minimum folding energy differences (MFEDs) of 15%, substantially greater than

25

previously examined viruses such as HCV (MFED 7-9%). High MFED values were shared with all

coronavirus genomes analysed created by several hundred consecutive energetically favoured stem-

loops throughout the genome. In contrast to replication-association RNA structure, GORS was poorly

conserved in the positions and identities of base pairing with other sarbecoviruses – even similarly

positioned stem-loops in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV rarely shared homologous pairings, indicative of

INTRODUCTION

40

The emergence of SARS-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 in Wuhan, China was the start of a

worldwide pandemic of frequently severe, fatal respiratory disease termed COVID-19 (1-4). The

ultimate outcome of the pandemic in terms of global morbidity will be devastating with a fear that

recurrent episodes of COVID-19 disease will occur regularly unless effective medical interventions

45

such as global immunisation can be implemented.

In predicting the future of the COVID-19 pandemic, understanding the ability of a virus to persist at a

population level is paramount. Its long term presence is governed by its intrinsic transmissibility and

the ongoing existence of susceptible individuals to maintain transmission. Transmissibility in turn

50

depends on factors such as its route of spread, the resilience of the virus in the environment and the

duration of host immunity after infection and virus clearance. It additionally crucially depends on

host persistence; prolonged shedding of infectious virus enables a larger number of susceptible

individuals in contact with an infected host to become infected.

55

In modelling the spread of SARS-CoV-2, information on many of these factors is becoming available.

Of greatest concern, populations, such the UK and the USA which have been severely affected by

COVID-19,

nevertheless

display

low

levels

of

population

exposure

(5-8),

indicating

that

further

rounds of infection will not be substantially influenced by herd immunity, even pre-supposing that

infection confers long-term protection. Examples from other respiratory coronaviruses in humans (9-

60

11) or enteric coronaviruses in animals (12-14) do not provide much reassurance on the latter.

Furthermore,

SARS-CoV-2

is

highly

transmissible

through

respiratory

routes

and

close

contact

(15,16), it is relatively stable in the environment (17) and SARS-CoV-2 is shed in substantial amounts

from respiratory secretions and is infectious through inhalation and ingestion. The final factor, virus

persistence with the infected host and the consequent duration of virus shedding is still poorly

65

documented with a paucity of long-term longitudinal studies of infected individuals so close to the

start of the pandemic (see Discussion).

These

different from each over most of the genome yet the overall degree of folding is relatively constant;

80

structure conservation is only apparent within the 3’ end of NS5B and core gene regions and the

untranslated genome termini that have known or suspected replication/ translation functions (20).

Without structural conservation, GORS can be best detected thermodynamically, by comparing the

minimum folding energy of a WT sequence with an ensemble of control sequences where the base

85

order of the WT sequence has been shuffled (21,22). As examples, this sequence order dependent

structure averages at around 8% in HCV, 9% in foot-and-mouth disease virus and 11% in human

pegivirus, similar to the extensively structured ribosomal RNA sequences of animals, plants and

prokaryotes (19). The association between possession of GORS and virus persistence extends over all

species where information on abilities to persist are documented and has potential predictive value

90

for viruses whose ability to persist is undocumented.

In the current study, we have analysed genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and members of other

coronavirus species and genera infecting humans and other mammals for the presence of GORS. The

105

formation in each sequence was based upon comparison of minimum free energy (MFE) on folding

the native sequence with those of sequence order shuffled controls (a procedure that maintained

mono- and dinucleotide frequencies of the native sequence, but otherwise substantially randomised

its sequence order). Subtraction of the mean shuffled sequence MFE from the native MFE yielded an

MFE difference

110

(MFED) that represent the

primary metric

for quantifying

RNA structure in

the

current study. SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and bat-derived homologues all showed evidence for large

scale RNA structure with mean MFED values of around 15% (Fig. 1; raw data listed in Table S1; Suppl.

Data). These were substantially higher than that MFED levels of unstructured viruses (mean value

1.1%) and indeed of the majority of structured +strand RNA viruses displaying host persistence,

including

By analysing MFED values for individual sequence

apparent that SARS-CoV-2 was structured throughout the genome (Fig. 2). Consistently high values

of around 20% were found in the nsp2 and nsp3 genes in the ORF1A-encoding region, around 10-

15% in in the remainder of ORF1a and in ORF1b, the spike gene and a peak of >50% in the ORF3a

distribution of elevated values as SARS-CoV-2 with some differences in parts of nsp3, spike and

ORF3a genes. To investigate the extent to which RNA structure formation imposed constraints on

sequence change, variability at synonymous sites in aligned coding sequences of each gene were

calculated (green line; Fig. 2). SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are genetically distinct from each other

throughout the genome, but low values indicating constraints did not associate closely with high

MFED values or vice versa.

Each of the human seasonal coronavirus has a known or suspected zoonotic origin (reviewed in

(23)), with closely related homologues of OC43 identified in cows, NL63, 229E and MERS-CoV in bats.

135

SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to a coronavirus identified in a bat species (2) that may also represent

its ultimate zoonotic source. No genetically close homologues of SARS-CoV or HKU1 are known. Each

loops and unpaired bases in terminal loops of each identified and assigned a height of zero on the z-

axis, with genome position and sequence number recorded in the x- and y-axes in a 3–dimensional

150

plot (Fig. 4A). Paired bases either side of the terminal loop were successively plotted according to a

colour scale that reflects their distance in the stem relative to the terminal loop. The resulting plot

therefore provides an approximate visualisation of the positions, shapes and sizes of RNA structure

elements across whole alignments. The 3-dimensional representation can be transformed to a 2-

dimensional plot with height indicated by colour coding (Fig. 4B).

155

A contour plot was made of an alignment of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and bat-derived sarbecoviruses

(Fig. 5). Variants within SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were minimally divergent and each produced

essentially the same

structure predictions. However, these were somewhat different from each

other and from bat sarbecoviruses throughout large parts of the genome, highlighting regions with

160

quite different RNA secondary structural organisation of duplex and unpaired regions. Larger scale

analyses of two regions of the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV genomes (positions 2601 – 3400 [in ORF1a]

across the entire ORF1a/1b gene, despite these and consistently different actual pairings between

the two viruses (Fig. 5).

170

In the NS3a / E region, a greater degree of RNA structure conservation was evident in the contour

plot. Most predicted stem-loops located to the same places in the alignment, although on closer

examination of the base identities of the duplex regions, the actual pairings were non-homologous

in the majority of stem-loops (grey dotted arrows in Fig. 6). Despite alignment of the sequences by

nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity (and conservation with other sarbecoviruses), duplexes

175

were often formed by distinct bases in the two viruses. For example, pairings in the first stem-loop in

SARS-CoV-2 were displaced 5’ by 2 nucleotide positions in the corresponding SARS-CoV sequence (-

2). Pairing displacements of -3 (SL4), -7 (SL8), +3 (SL9), -5 (SL10), +6 (SL12) and -16 (SL13) were

observed in otherwise similarly positioned and shaped secondary structure elements, with only SL2

and SL5-SL7 showing evidence for homologous pairing. These observations, recapitulated to even

180

greater extents throughout the remainder of the genome, indicate a considerably faster evolution of

RNA secondary structure than their underlying coding sequences. For comparison, RNA structures in

OC43 and a set of homologues from animals (pigs, cows, camels, giraffe, deer and dogs) were

visualised in a separate contour plot (Fig. S1; Suppl. Data). This similarly depicted widely distributed

stem-loops through the genome and a degree of structure conservation consistent with the lower

185

degree of sequence divergence between the variants analysed.

Secondary structure elements is SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses primarily comprised simple,

sequential stem-loop with single unpaired terminal unpaired regions. A total of 657 stem-loops were

predicted for SARS-CoV-2, comparable to totals for other coronaviruses (range 500-625), formed

190

from 2015 duplex regions of 3 or more consecutive base pairs (Table S4; Suppl. Data). Duplexes in

stem-loops were frequently interrupted to avoid paired regions longer than 14 consecutive base-

pairs.

Influence of RNA secondary structure on viral diversity.

While the functional basis for the adoption

of pervasive RNA secondary structure is unknown, the apparent requirement for extensive base-

pairing in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses genomes would be expected to impose constraints

on sequence change. Most individual mutations in paired sites would have the effect of weakening

RNA secondary structures and lead to a greater phenotypic cost than changes at unpaired sites. For

200

all coronaviruses analysed, approximately 62-67% of bases were predicted be paired (Table S4;

was increasing over-representation of unpaired bases at sites showing greater sequence divergence

DISCUSSION

Prediction of RNA secondary structure.

The primary evidence for the existence of RNA structure

formation in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus genomes derived from high MFED values across the

genome. Values of 15% in SARS-CoV-2, 17% in OC43 (and up to 24% in a deltacoronavirus) are

225

unprecedentedly high compared to those documented for HCV (7-9%, HPgV-1 (11%) and a range of

others reported to possess genome scale ordered RNA structure (18,19). MFED calculations identify

the sequence order contribution to RNA folding, where elevated values arising from folding energies

An independent method to detect and characterise RNA folding, including the identities of individual

is

on

Evidence

for

is

provided

by

observation of compensatory changes to maintain binding. In this respect, the extremely limited

240

variability of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and indeed of each of the sequence datasets of

seasonal coronaviruses prevented this approach from being usefully applied. A second problem is

that large scale RNA structure in other viruses, such as HCV, is not necessarily conserved in the same

way as it might be in functional RNA structure elements (20). We recently documented substantial

variability in pairing sites both between HCV subtypes in large areas of the genome, with structure

245

conservation restricted to functionally mapped

cis-

acting replication elements in the NS5B region

and in stem-loops of undefined function in the core gene (28-33). Covariance detection therefore

cannot be applied to verify pairing sites in viruses with GORS. Evidence for an analogous lack of

pairing constraints and comparably rapid evolution of RNA structure is provided by comparison of

RNA structure predictions for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (Figs. 5-7). While there is some similarity in

250

the positions and sizes of predicted stem-loop across their genomes (Fig. 5), particularly apparent in

the ORF3a / E region (Fig. 6), the actual pairings forming shared stem-loop were non-homologous

with frequent displacement of paired based between viruses even though the sizes and spacings of

stem-loops were often quite conserved (Fig. 7). This form of “extended” or “inexact” covariance is

apparent throughout the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV genome and supports the idea that it is simple

255

maintenance of pairing rather than functional properties of the stem-loops that are formed that is

driving RNA structure formation in coronavirus genomes.

This conclusion is supported by the sheer scale of RNA structure in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. This

possesses perhaps 650 or more separate stem-loops across the genome – accepting that many of

260

these predicted structures may derive simply from “over-folding” by energy minimisation programs

Evolutionary constraints of RNA secondary structure. Notwithstanding the potential inaccuracies of
a proportion of specific pairing predictions made by RNAFOLD, the marked difference in sequence

variability at paired and unpaired sites (Fig. 8) provides evidence that pairing requirements influence

SARS-CoV-2 adaptive fitness and potentially limit its longer-term evolutionary trajectory. A striking

observation was the frequency dependent over-representation of variability at unpaired sites; sites

consensus sequences generated by NGS methods, particularly with high read depths, rarely contain

sequencing errors. However, even a very low frequency of technical mis-assignments in a sequence

dataset of over 17,000 full genome sequences will inevitably contain errors and these may have

contributed to the lack of association with pairing. Nevertheless, a further and potentially more

significant contributor to

the large number of single

sequence mutations (n=3517) may be the

sporadic occurrence of mutations occurring in founder viruses infecting individuals that possess

285

minor fitness defects. These may prevent their propagation and inheritance in other SARS-CoV-2

strains and lack of representation in multiple sequences in the larger dataset. The observation that

Of the 12 possible mutations, C->U transitions were the most commonly observed in the dataset,

consistent with their previously proposed origin through specific RNA editing events by APOBEC or

A further uncertainty about the purpose and mechanisms of GORS-associated structures is the as yet

unexplained correlation between RNA structure formation and virus persistence (18,19). Among

many possibilities, we have previously suggested that decreased virus recognition by the innate

On the face of it, the finding that not only SARS-CoV-2, but also all four of the seasonal human

coronaviruses possess intensely structured genomes does not square with the previously noted

the dearth of focussed studies on durations of virus shedding and potential sites of replication

virus, >20% in the case of NL63 (9). In many cases infections were by the same clade of virus and

Many of the coronaviruses characterised in pigs have arisen in major

outbreaks potentially from zoonotic sources, including porcine deltacoronavirus in 2014 from a

coronavirus in 2016 from bats (reviewed in (54)). A lack of host adaptation immediately after recent

zoonotic spread may contribute the varying outcomes of pig coronavirus infections. Coronaviruses in

bats are distributed in the

diverse and host specific. Establishing whether infections are persistent in bats is problematic in a

rhinolophid bats in Japan (56) and 30% in various bat species in the Philippines (57) are strongly

indicative of persistence. Overall, coronaviruses clearly have a propensity to persist although their

370

ability to achieve this may depend on their degree of host adaptation.

Turning to recently emerged coronaviruses in humans, the course of SARS-CoV infections can be

prolonged, up to 126 days in faecal samples (58) although little information on persistence was

collected before the outbreak terminated.

375

MERS-CoV infections are persistent in camels but show

variable outcomes in humans with respiratory detection and faecal excretion typically ceasing 3-4

weeks after infection onset (59,60) but with individual case reports of much longer persistence in

some individuals (46). Based on what is known for other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 clearly has the

potential for persistence and indeed probably is persistent in its immediate bat source,

(2). Its current presentation as an acute, primarily respiratory infection may represent the

typical course of a recently zoonotically transmitted virus with the potential for future adaptive

changes to increases its systemic spread and achieve a degree of host persistence apparent in many

animal coronaviruses.

Even in the current pandemic period 6 months after the zoonotic event, relatively long periods of

385

respiratory sample detection and faecal excretion of SARS-CoV-2 have been documented, in many

cases of greater than 1 month duration (61-65). These occur in both mild and severe cases of COVID-

RNA STRUCTURE PREDICTION IN CORONAVIRUSES AND

PREVIOUSLY CHARACTERISED PERSISTENT / NON-PERSISTENT +STRAND RNA VIRUSES

RNA structure formation was predicted by comparison of minimum folding energies of virus native

sequences with those of shuffled controls (MFED value on the y-axis). (A) Data points represent

MFEDs for type member of each currently classified coronavirus species (listed in Table S1; Suppl.

Data) and a separate category for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and a range of SARS-like viruses infecting

bats (sarbecoviruses). Human viruses and widely investigated coronaviruses infecting other species

are labelled. (B) MFED values of previously analysed +strand mammalian viruses from a previous

study and that reported the association between RNA structure and persistence (19).
