Summary

eliciting high titres of neutralising antibodies against the viral spike (S). However, the

30

merits of broadly targeting S versus focusing antibody onto the smaller receptor

31

binding domain (RBD) are unclear. Here we assessed prototypic S and RBD subunit

32

vaccines in homologous or heterologous prime-boost regimens in mice and non-

33

human primates. We find S is highly immunogenic in mice, while the comparatively

34

poor immunogenicity of RBD was associated with limiting germinal centre and T

35

follicular helper cell activity. Boosting S-primed mice with either S or RBD

36

significantly augmented neutralising titres, with RBD-focussing driving moderate

37

improvement in serum neutralisation. In contrast, both S and RBD vaccines were

38

comparably immunogenic in macaques, eliciting serological neutralising activity that

39

generally exceed levels in convalescent humans. These studies confirm recombinant S

40

proteins as promising vaccine candidates and highlight multiple pathways to

41

achieving potent serological neutralisation.

Introduction

46

unprecedented global scientific efforts to develop, test and manufacture novel

47

protective vaccines. The spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is a clear target for

48

vaccines designed to elicit neutralising antibodies to prevent infection. Recent studies

49

suggest neutralising antibodies can protect macaques against SARS-CoV-2 (Deng et

50

al., 2020; Guebre-Xabier et al., 2020; Zost et al., 2020) and observational human

51

studies also suggest neutralising antibody responses are protective against re-infection

52

(Addetia et al., 2020). S is a type 1 viral fusion protein, expressed as a single

53

polypeptide and cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits, with a hetero-trimeric quaternary

54

structure common to many respiratory viruses (reviewed in Li, 2016). Cell entry is

55

mediated by engagement of the enzyme ACE2 on the target cell surface by the viral

56

receptor binding domain (RBD), localised within the C-terminal domain of S1 (Lan et

57

al., 2020; Walls et al., 2020). Antibodies capable of preventing RBD binding to ACE2

58

can therefore prevent infection and constitute an efficient pathway to neutralisation.

The rapid onset and global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spurred

59
60

Viruses employ numerous strategies to avoid immune recognition of viral entry

61

proteins, including heavy decoration with N-linked glycans (Watanabe et al., 2020),

62

employing immune distraction or escape by focussing host immunity onto highly

63

mutable regions (Li et al., 2020). A shared challenge for vaccine development against

64

viral glycoproteins is therefore ensuring maximum B cell recognition of neutralising

65

epitopes critical for viral replication (on-target), while minimising responses to poorly

66

conserved epitopes or those with no antiviral capacity (off-target).

67
68

Currently, several S-based vaccines are entering early stage clinical trials, including

69

recombinant trimeric S proteins, monomeric or trimeric RBD domains, and analogues

delivered by viral vectors or mRNA (Folegatti et al., 2020; Jackson et al., 2020;

71

Keech et al., 2020; Mulligan et al., 2020; Walsh et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020).

72

However, the relative merits of these immunogens are currently unclear. In particular,

73

does the use of a smaller vaccine target, such as the RBD, drive a more focussed

74

neutralising antibody response? Or alternatively, do additional epitopes across the

75

larger S protein make additive contributions to immunogenicity or neutralisation that

76

counteract any off-target immune distraction? Here we directly compare the

77

immunogenic profile of SARS-CoV-2 S and RBD immunogens in mice and non-

78

human primates using various prime-boost approaches. We find in mice that RBD is

79

relatively poorly immunogenic compared to S, with primary immunisation

80

compromised by a reduced capacity to efficiently induce germinal centre B cells and

81

recruit effective T follicular helper cells. In contrast, immunisation with S alone, or

82

boosting S-primed animals with S or RBD, is potently immunogenic, reliably eliciting

83

strong binding and neutralising titres in immunised mice. In more genetically diverse

84

non-human primates, two immunisations with either S or RBD immunogens were

85

comparably immunogenic and produced strong serological neutralising responses.

86

Overall, we find that immunisation with recombinant S immunogens reliably elicits

87

potentially protective humoral immunity at levels in excess of those observed in

88

convalescent humans.

(Figure 1A; median 1.85 x 105; IQR 1.34-4.61), but without inducing significant

96

neutralisation activity (Figure 1B). In contrast, a single immunisation of RBD elicited

97

minimal serum antibody in line with other reports of sub-optimal immunogenicity of

98

RBD in mice (Mandolesi et al., 2020) and recent Phase I trials comparing RBD or S

99

encoded by RNA-based vaccines (Walsh et al., 2020). Although S is extensively

100

glycosylated (Watanabe et al., 2020), limiting complex glycan deposition by

101

expression in HEK293 cell lines lacking N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (S gnt-)

102

did not negatively impact the potent immunogenicity of S (Figure 1A).

103
104

The elicitation of SARS-CoV-2 specific B and T cell responses in the draining iliac

105

and inguinal lymph nodes (LN) was assessed by flow cytometry. S-immunised

106

animals displayed robust induction of germinal centre (GC) B cells measured either

107

by intracellular BCL-6+ (median 3.4%; IQR 2.8-4.5) or surface GL7+ (median 58.5%;

108

IQR 51.0-63.8) expression (Figure 1C; gating in Figure S1). Immunisation with OVA

109

induced intermediate frequencies of BCL-6+ (median 1.1%; IQR 0.8-1.5) and GL7+

110

(median 32.0%; IQR 28.2-38.1) B cells, with minimal detection of GC formation in

111

RBD-immunised animals (BCL-6+; median 0.3%; IQR 0.2-0.4) (GL7+; median

112

15.9%; IQR 12.1-21.1). The specificity of GC B cells (IgD-B220+GL7+CD38lo) was

113

examined using recombinant S and RBD probes, as previously described (Juno et al.,

114

2020). Both S-specific (S+RBD-) and RBD-specific (S+RBD+) were reliably detected

115

in S-immunised animals, constituting 21.5% (IQR 15.3-26.3) and 1.2% (IQR 0.47-

116

2.27) of GC B cells respectively (Figure 1D). Mirroring the serum antibody response,

117

few S- or RBD-specific GC B cells were observed in RBD-immunised animals.

119

Consistent with GC B cell frequencies, immunisation with S induced high frequencies

120

of T follicular helper (TFH) cells (CXCR5++BCL-6+; median 0.7%; 0.3-1.1) relative

121

to OVA (median 0.4%; 0.2-0.8) or RBD (median 0.13%, 0.1-0.2) (Figure 1E; gating

122

Figure S2). The median fluorescent intensity (MFI) of BCL-6 expression in TFH was

123

notably higher in S-vaccinated animals (median 5303 for S, 4756 for OVA and 4353

124

for RBD) (Figure 1E). Analysis of TFH specificity using an activation induced

125

marker (AIM) assay (Jiang et al., 2019) and pools of RBD or non-RBD S overlapping

126

peptides indicated that the TFH response is dominated by non-RBD-localised epitopes

127

in S-immunised animals (Figure 1F). Further, RBD peptides elicited weak CD154

128

responses upon re-stimulation in comparison to non-RBD peptides (Figure 1F).

129

Epitope mapping of peptides spanning the RBD indicated that only 3 RBD-derived

130

peptides were recognised by CD4 T cells in C57BL/6 mice (Figure S3), one of which

131

was

132

TNVYADSFVIRGDEV). In contrast, a more extensive number (>8) of S epitopes

133

were identified outside the RBD (4 of which are shown in Figure S3). In S-vaccinated

134

animals, the 3 RBD-derived epitopes were subdominant to the most immunogenic

135

non-RBD S epitopes and relatively poor inducers of CD154 expression (Figure S3).

136

These data suggest that the presence of the single relatively immunogenic TFH

137

epitope (P99) within the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is insufficient to drive a robust CD4 T

part through suboptimal recruitment of quality TFH responses.

Homologous spike and heterologous spike/RBD prime-boost immunisations

149

elicit potent binding and neutralising antibody responses in mice

150

Despite potentially compromised immunogenicity, the small antigenic target of the

151

RBD remains attractive for focusing immunity upon protective neutralising epitopes.

152

However, the recent identification of N-terminal domain (NTD) (Chi et al., 2020) and

153

other alternative S-localised protective epitopes (Liu et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 2020)

154

highlights additional antibody targets for vaccine protection. To assess the relative

155

merits of RBD-focussed antibody responses versus more holistically targeting the

156

entire S, we primed C57BL/6 mice with S or RBD, and then boosted 21 days later

157

with either homologous or heterologous immunogens. Homologous S prime-boost (S-

158

S) elicited high reciprocal serum endpoint titres of both S- (median 2.77 x 106; IQR

159

1.71–3.62) and RBD-specific antibodies (2.28 x 106; IQR 1.23-3.17) (Figure 2A). In

160

contrast to a single RBD dose, we found that homologous RBD prime-boost (R-R)

161

immunisation was capable of eliciting modest serum titres of S- and RBD-specific

162

antibodies. RBD prime-S boost (R-S) induced similarly modest titres. However, we

163

find RBD boosting of S-primed animals (S-R) markedly increased RBD-specific

164

serum antibody titres 4.2-fold relative to S-S (p=0.0055). Inhibition of ACE2-RBD

165

interaction by serum antibodies was similarly enhanced in the S-R group compared to

166

the S-S group (Figure 2B, Figure S5). Selective RBD focussing translated into

167

increased serum neutralisation, with S-R eliciting 2.5-fold higher activity (median

168

361; IQR 226-706) compared to S-S (143; IQR 96-254) (p=0.0055) (Figure 2C).

activity, although they elicited modest levels of antibodies that block ACE2-RBD

171

engagement. The capacity of S-S and S-R immunisation to elicit potent binding and

172

neutralising responses in C57BL/6 mice was mirrored in BALB/c mice (Figure S6).

173
174

The profile of B and T cell immunity was assessed in draining lymph nodes 2 weeks

175

after the boost immunisation. R-R elicited the lowest GC B cell responses measured

176

using BCL-6+ (0.5%; IQR 0.4-1.2) or surface GL7+ (22.3%; IQR 20.5-31.6)

177

expression (Figure 2D). Both S-S (BCL-6+: 1.9%; IQR 1.5-2.5) (GL7+: 47.8%, IQR

178

44.3-62.3) and S-R (BCL-6+: 1.9%; IQR 1.4-2.2) (GL7+: 52.7%; IQR 49.7-54.5)

179

displayed intermediate induction of GC activity, while R-S immunised animals

180

showed robust GC induction (BCL-6+: 3.0%; IQR 2.3-3.2) (GL7+: 54.2%; IQR 45.9-

181

57.6), likely reflecting a primary response against non-RBD epitopes within S. The

182

hierarchy of GC activity was mirrored in the frequency of probe-specific GC B cells,

183

with R-S (19.5% (IQR:14.7-21.8) and S-S (10.6%; IQR 9.46-14.4) eliciting high

184

frequencies of S-specific GC B cells (Figure 2E), while low frequencies were

185

observed for R-R (1.83%; IQR 1.25-2.98) and S-R groups (2.9%; IQR 2.21-4.96).

186

RBD-specific GC B cells were highest in R-R (8.07%; IQR 3.58-11.9) and S-R

187

(6.79%; IQR 5.65-14.2) groups, with lower frequencies after S-S (2.86%; 0.96-

188

7.11%) and R-S regimens (1.20%; IQR 0.67-2.62). GC TFH frequencies were highest

189

in R-S animals (0.69%, IQR 0.6-1.1) compared to the other groups (R-R 0.4%, IQR

196

To enable serial measurements in a highly relevant animal model, we next immunised

197

pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) with S and RBD protein vaccines

198

formulated with an MPLA liposomal adjuvant (Baldrick et al., 2002). Two doses in

199

all three vaccine regimens, R-R (n = 2), S-S (n = 3) and S-R (n = 3), reliably elicited

200

robust serum antibody responses against S and RBD proteins (Figure 3A), together

201

with a corresponding rise in both ACE2-RBD inhibition (Figure 3B) and neutralising

202

activity (Figure 3C; median titre 202, IQR 160-241). Responses in macaques were

203

notably more variable than mice and no major differences were discernible between

204

the small groups.

205
206

B and T cells responses to immunisation were assessed two weeks after the boost in

207

the draining lymph nodes of immunised animals, identified based upon staining with a

208

co-formulated tracking dye (Barber-Axthelm et al., 2020). The utility of employing a

209

tracking dye for identifying vaccine-draining LN was exemplified by animal NM224

210

(Figure S7). While 7/8 animals exhibited dye staining of the iliac LN, the primary site

211

of antigen drainage from quadricep intramuscular vaccination (Barber-Axthelm et al.,

212

2020), NM224 showed dye staining of only the inguinal LN. Total GC B and TFH

213

frequencies, as well as antigen-specific GC B and TFH frequencies, were enriched in

214

the dyed inguinal LN compared to the unstained iliac LN (Barber-Axthelm et al.,

2020).

220

(12.6%, range 7.86-17.4) immunised animals. GC B cell specificity was also assessed

221

by S- or RBD-probe binding (Figure 3E). RBD-specific B cells were detected in all

222

groups, with R-R immunised animals displaying the highest levels (22.7%, range

223

22.3-23.1) followed by the S-R (9.02%, range 7.73-11.4) and S-S (3.88%, range 2.03-

224

4.43) groups. In contrast, high frequencies of S-specific GC B cells were elicited in S-

225

S (4.81%, range 3.41-7.71) and S-R (9.11%, range 0.82-13.6) immunised, but not R-R

226

immunised animals.

227
228

GC TFH (CD3+CD4+CXCR5++PD-1++; gating in Figure S9A) were also detected in

229

all draining lymph nodes (11.4% of total LN CD4+ T cells), with a median of 13%

230

exhibiting recent proliferation as measured by Ki-67 expression (Figure 3F). S-

231

specific TFH targeting either non-RBD or RBD peptides were detected in all animals;

232

interestingly, RBD-derived peptides tended to be more frequently recognised by GC

233

TFH than non-RBD epitopes (2.4% non-RBD, S-specific versus 6.2% RBD-specific;

The elicitation of memory lymphocyte populations is a key aim for protective

vaccines. Circulating S- and RBD-specific memory B cells (CD20+IgD-; gating

highest in S-S immunised animals (0.37%, range 0.32-0.49), and approximately

equivalent frequencies in R-R (0.195%, range 0.192-0.193), and S-R (0.12%, range

(cTFH; gating Figure S9B-C) were detected in blood two weeks after the vaccine

boost (Figure 3I). In contrast to previous observations in convalescent human donors

(Juno), NHP S-specific cTFH recognised non-RBD and RBD-derived peptides at

248

similar frequencies (Figure 3J). Among all animals, RBD-specific cTFH frequencies

correlated with S antibody titres suggesting that, analagous to humans (Bentebibel et

Profile of responses in mice, macaques and humans.

255

While our results suggest that adjuvanted protein vaccines are reliably immunogenic

256

in mice and non-human primates, it remains unclear how well these models

257

recapitulate human immunity to SARS-CoV-2. As a reference, S- and RBD-specific

258

antibody and serum neutralisation titres were assessed in a panel of 72 convalescent

259

donors recovered from COVID-19 (participant details in Table 1). We find that both

260

S-S and S-R immunised mice display high comparative titres, with potent serum

261

neutralisation appearing upon boosting with SARS-CoV-2 immunogens (Figure 4).

262

Similarly, immunisation of NHP with one or two doses of SARS-CoV-2

263

270

vaccine-elicited GC B cells in mice are drawn primarily from VH1-like gene families,

271

in comparison to the VH3 and VH4 families that are predominant in RBD- and S-

272

specific B cells recovered in the LN or PBMC of an immunised macaque (Figure

273

S10). In contrast to immunised animals, RBD- and S-specific B cells sequenced from

274

PBMC of convalescent subjects are drawn from a range of V-gene families, although

275

we and others have reported biasing toward some VH3 family genes including VH3-

276

30 and VH3-53/VH-3-66 (Juno et al., 2020; Robbiani et al., 2020). In terms of CDR-

277

H3 length, recovered CDR-H3 from immunised mice were consistently shorter

278

(median 11; IQR 10-12) relative to macaque LN (15; IQR 13-18) and PBMC (15;

279

IQR 13-18), which were directly comparable to lengths observed for RBD- and S-

280

specific immunoglobulin sequences observed in convalescent subjects (15; IQR 13-

281

18).

285

(Mulligan et al., 2020; Walsh et al., 2020) are immunogenic in human subjects.

286

However the comparative performance of each immunogen in pre-clinical animal

287

models, and the potential for combinatorial use in heterologous prime-boost

288

strategies, is unclear. In line with other reports (Mandolesi et al., 2020; Walsh et al.,

289

2020), we find the intrinsic immunogenicity of the RBD is limited in mice after a

290

single or two doses, likely reflecting inefficient recruitment of high-quality TFH in

291

the primary response, analogous to our previous report for influenza hemagglutinin

292

stem immunogens (Tan et al., 2019). In contrast, priming of mice with S resulted in

293

consistently higher serum titres and neutralising activity, irrespective of the

294

subsequent boosting immunogen, highlighting the impact of a broader TFH repertoire

295

in modulating the magnitude of immune responses after boosting. RBD was notably

296

more immunogenic in vaccinated non-human primates in the context of greater

297

MHCII loci and allelic diversity compared to mice. Nevertheless, the limited

298

recognition of the RBD by B and cTFH cells following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Juno

299

et al., 2020) suggests that at a population level, RBD-based immunogens might be

300

less reliable vaccine antigens than S, which was robustly immunogenic in all species.

301
302

Selective recall of RBD responses by heterologous S-R prime boost immunisation

303

focussed antibody recognition onto the ACE2 recognition site in mice, as evidenced

304

by enhanced ACE2-RBD inhibition activity and a minor increase in neutralising

305

activity. In contrast, enhanced neutralisation activity was not seen in S-R immunised

306

macaques, where titres were equivalent to S-S animals. This mirrors our recent

307

findings in convalescent humans, where serological neutralising activity was not

308

exclusively RBD-directed (Juno et al., 2020), and suggests alternative S-localised

309

epitopes such as the NTD (Chi et al., 2020), may contribute to vaccine-elicited

310

protection. While mice have tremendous utility for immunological research including

311

vaccine development efforts, we found divergent gene family usage and constrained

312

CDR-H3 lengths in vaccine-elicited B cell responses in mice compared to immunised

313

macaques or convalescent humans. These differences might explain the comparatively

314

high serological binding titres required in mice for neutralisation activity compared to

315

humans and immunised primates. Notably, many reported neutralising human

316

monoclonal antibodies specific for epitopes outside the RBD, such as the N-terminal

317

domain (Chi et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020), display extended CDR-H3 loops of 20-

318

25AA, considerably longer than what is commonly seen in mice. Therefore, genetic

319

constraints in the murine immunoglobulin repertoire might impact vaccine-elicited

320

humoral immunity to S, with implications for stratification of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines

321

for eventual human use.

322
323

Most reports of clinical and pre-clinical SARS-CoV-2 vaccine assessment have been

324

benchmarked against convalescent subjects recovered from COVID-19. However,

325

numerous groups including ours have reported that neutralising titres in convalescent

326

subjects are comparatively weak (Jackson et al., 2020; Juno et al., 2020; Keech et al.,

327

2020; Mulligan et al., 2020; Walsh et al., 2020) and appear to wane rapidly (Ibarrondo

328

et al., 2020; Long et al., 2020; Seow et al., 2020). Here a simple two protein regime

329

using licensure-friendly adjuvants was able to elicit superior binding and neutralising

330

antibody responses. Prototypic vaccines induced strong GC activity in draining lymph

331

nodes, driving somatic maturation of S-specific B cells, and seeded memory T and B

332

cell responses in the blood. Overall, our study suggests that vaccination constitutes a

333

more robust and reliable pathway to serological protection against SARS-CoV-2 than

334

natural infection, similar to other pathogens such as human papillomavirus (Harper et

335

al., 2004; Villa et al., 2006).

Supplemental Figure 8. Macaque B cell gating strategy. Gating of antigen-specific (A) germinal centre
B cells in lymph nodes or (B) circulating memory B cells in PBMC samples. Lymphocytes were identified
by FSC-A vs SSC-A gating, followed by doublet exclusion (FSC-A vs FSC-H), and gating on dump- (CD3CD8-CD14-CD10-CD16-streptavidin-) live CD20+ B cells. (A) Antigen-specific germinal center B cells
were identified from class-switched IgD- B cells and intracellular expression of BCL6 and Ki-67.
Alternatively, (B) circulating memory B cells in PBMC samples were identified as CD20+IgD-. Antigen
specificity was determined by binding to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and/or SARS-CoV-2 RBD probes.
