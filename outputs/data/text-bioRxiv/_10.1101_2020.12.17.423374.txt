Abstract
Background: Malaria, caused by Plasmodium, is a global life-threatening infection disease especially
during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is still unclear about the dynamic change and the
interactions between intestinal microbiota and host immunity. Here, we investigated the change of
intestinal microbiome and transcriptome during the whole Plasmodium infection process in mice to
analyze the dynamic landscape of parasitaemia dependent intestinal microbiota shifting and related
to host immunity.
Results: There were significant parasitaemia dependent changes of intestinal microbiota and
transcriptome, and the microbiota was significantly correlated to the intestinal immunity. We found
that (i) the diversity and composition of the intestinal microbiota represented a significant
correlation along with the Plasmodium infection in family, genus and species level; (ii) the
up-regulated genes from the intestinal transcriptome were mainly enriched in immune cell
differentiation pathways along with the malaria development, particularly, naive CD4+ T cells
differentiation; (iii) the abundance of the parasitaemia phase-specific microbiota represented a high
correlation with the phase-specific immune cells development, particularly, Th1 cell with family
