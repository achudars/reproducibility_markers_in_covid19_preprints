The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is raging across the world, leading to a global mortality rate of 3.4% (estimated by World Health
Organization in March 2020). As a potential vaccine and therapeutic target, the nucleocapsid protein
of SARS-CoV-2 (nCoVN) functions in packaging the viral genome and viral self-assembly. To
investigate the biological effects of nCoVN to human stem cells, genetically engineered human
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) expressing nCoVN (iPSC-nCoVN) were generated by
lentiviral expression systems, in which the expression of nCoVN could be induced by the
doxycycline. The proliferation rate of iPSC-nCoVN was decreased. Unexpectedly, the morphology
of iPSC started to change after nCoVN expression for 7 days. The pluripotency marker TRA-1-81
were not detectable in iPSC-nCoVN after a four-day induction. Meanwhile, iPSC-nCoVN lost the
ability for differentiation into cardiomyocytes with a routine differentiation protocol. The RNA-seq
data of iPSC-nCoVN (induction for 30 days) and immunofluorescence assays illustrated that iPSCnCoVN were turning to fibroblast-like cells. Our data suggested that nCoVN disrupted the
pluripotent properties of iPSC and turned them into other types of cells, which provided a new
insight to the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2.

Right now, the COVID-19 pandemic is sweeping the world, causing a huge crisis in public health
and economics globally. According to the continuously updated data from World Health
Organization, to date, nearly three million infected cases were confirmed, while more than 200,000
individuals died because of COVID-19 (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novelcoronavirus-2019). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was
proved to be the pathogen of COVID-19, has 79% identity in genomes with severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Lu et al., 2020). Twelve coding regions were predicted in
SARS-CoV-2, including spike protein, nucleocapsid protein, envelope protein, and membrane
protein (Lu et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020). The Cryo-EM structure of spike protein
had been determined (Wrapp et al., 2020), and more and more evidences showed that the spike
protein binds human ACE2 to entry into host cells (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020), which
indicated that SARS-CoV-2 might share similar pathogenic mechanisms with SARS-CoV. Because
of the very limited knowledge of SARS-CoV-2, we sought to understand the biology of SARS-CoV2 based on the previous studies about SARS-CoV.

As one of the most studied proteins in SARS-CoV, the nucleocapsid protein binds to viral RNA to
package the genome in a ribonucleoprotein particle (Chang et al., 2014). Unlike the spike protein
with a certain mutation frequency, the sequence of nucleocapsid protein was more stable (Chinese,
2004), which meant it was an ideal target for diagnostic tools (Severance et al., 2008; Suresh et al.,
2008; Das et al., 2010) and antiviral therapy (Cheung et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2016). The
pathogenic effects in host cells caused by the nucleocapsid protein were also studied. It was reported
that the nucleocapsid protein inhibited type I interferon production after virion infected the host cells
(Hu et al., 2017), which was considered as a possible mechanism of immune escape. The
nucleocapsid protein inhibited cell cytokinesis and proliferation (Zhou et al., 2008), and regulated
several pathways, such as transforming growth factor-beta signaling (Zhao et al., 2008), AP-1 signal
transduction pathway (He et al., 2003), and NF-KappaB pathway (Zhang et al., 2007b). Besides, the
nucleocapsid protein was reported as an apoptosis inducer in COS-1 cells (Surjit et al., 2004; Zhang
et al., 2007a) and HPF cells (Zhao et al., 2006).

As the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 (nCoVN) has 88.1% identity with the nucleocapsid
protein of SARS-CoV (Lu et al., 2020), it is reasonable to speculate that they share a same
pathogenic pathway in host cells. The original goal of this study is to determine the physiological
malfunctions, such as cardiac fibrosis, in human cardiomyocytes expressing nCoVN by using human
induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and direct cardiac-differentiation methods. However, the
morphology of iPSC altered obviously when nCoVN had been expressed for 7 days. This unexpected
observation inspired us some new thoughts: (i) It was likely that the adult stem cells could be
infected by SARS-CoV-2, in spite of lacking of the clinical data; (ii) iPSC were appropriate study
materials for stem cell research because of avoiding many ethical issues; (iii) The preliminary data
indicated that nCoVN seemed to be deleterious to iPSC, which meant it might also cause damages in
other stem cells. Therefore, we turned to investigate whether nCoVN obstructed the pluripotency
maintenance in iPSC. We believed that this study could help us to understand the deleterious effects
of nCoVN to human adult stem cells and embryonic stem cells.

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) DYR0100 (from The American Type Culture
Collection, ATCC) were plated on Matrigel matrix (hESC-Qualified, LDEV-Free, Corning, 354277)coated plates, and then were cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium (Gibco, 11320033) supplemented with
STEMUP® ES/iPS cell culture medium supplement (Nissan Chemical Corporation). STEMUP
medium was changed every two days. iPSC were passaged every three to four days or when the cell
culture was 80-90% confluent. During passages, iPSC were rinsed with 1× DPBS (Gibco, 14040133)
for one time then were treated with 0.5 mM EDTA (Invitrogen, 15575020) in 1× DPBS (Gibco,
14190144) for 10 minutes at room temperature. The split ratio was 1:3-1:6. The detailed
differentiation protocol was described in the previous published reports (Lin et al., 2017; Shekhar et
al., 2018). Briefly, iPSC were treated with the small molecule CHIR99021 (Tocris, 4423, final
concentration 10 M) in the RPMI-BSA medium [RPMI 1640 Medium (HyClone, SH30027.01)
supplemented with 213 g/ml AA2P (l-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate magnesium) (Sigma, A8960) and
0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma, A1470)] for 24 hours, then were incubated with RPMIBSA medium for 48 hours. On differentiation day 4, cells were treated with the small molecule IWP2
(Tocris, 3533, final concentration 5 M) in RPMI-BSA medium. After 48 hours, the medium was
changed to RPMI-BSA medium. Then, RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 3% KnockOut
Serum Replacement (Gibco, 10828-028) was used to culture the cardiomyocytes in the following
experiments. All the cells in this study (except iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes) were kept culturing in
the STEMUP medium until they were applied to other assays.

The cDNA of nCoVN with a N-terminal 6× His Tag coding sequence (GeneMedi) and puromycin
resistance gene were sub-cloned into the plasmid pCW-Cas9-Blast (Addgene, 83481) to replace Cas9
and Blast cDNA, respectively. Lentivirus preparation using a third generation lentivirus packaging
system were referred to the previous report (Jiang et al., 2015). We followed and modified the
protocol from Zhang lab to detect MOI of the lentivirus and perform transduction (Shalem et al.,
2014). After 24 hours of transduction, medium was changed to fresh STEMUP medium
supplemented with doxycycline hyclate (Sigma, D9891) for induction. Two days later, puromycin
(InvivoGen, ant-pr-1, final concentration 2 µg/mL) was added into the STEMUP medium
supplemented with doxycycline hyclate. After 2-3 days' selection, which resulted in a transduction
efficiency of ~30%, single cell clones were manually picked and re-seeded in separated wells. For

RNA-seq was performed by Novogene Co., Ltd. We obtained 151 bp paired-end RNA-seq reads
from an Illumina Novaseq instrument, average 23 million read pairs for 3 iPSC-GFP and 3 iPSCnCoVN samples. Adapters and low-quality bases in reads were trimmed by trim_galore (v0.6.5;
http://www.bioinformatics.-babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/). We employed Kallisto (v0.46.0)
(Bray et al., 2016) to determine the read count for each transcript and quantified transcript abundance
as transcripts per kilobase per million reads mapped (TPM), using gene annotation in the GENCODE
database (v32, GRCh38) (Frankish et al., 2019). Then we summed the read counts and TPM of all
alternative splicing transcripts of a gene to obtain gene expression levels. We restricted our analysis
to 22,201 expressed genes with an average TPM >=1 in either iPSC-GFP or iPSC-nCoVN samples.
DESeq2 (v1.26.0) (Love et al., 2014) was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
(false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 and abs(log2FoldChange) >3). The pathway analysis was
performed by ToppGene Suite (Chen et al., 2009). The raw RNA-seq data have been deposited in
GEO, and the accession number is pending.

We took gene expression values (i.e. log2(TPM)) in iPSC/ESC and fibroblast from ENCODE
(Consortium, 2012; Davis et al., 2018). Combining with our RNA-seq data, quantile normalization
(Bolstad et al., 2003) was performed, and then ComBat (Johnson et al., 2007) was used to remove the
batch correction. We selected the top 1000 genes with the largest variance to calculate the correlation
coefficients between samples. The heatmap was generated by pheatmap function in R.

As ACE2 was the major receptor of SARS-CoV-2 on the cell membrane (Hoffmann et al., 2020;
Wrapp et al., 2020), we first examined whether ACE2 was expressed in the stem cells. Thanks to the

collection
in
Gene
Expression
Omnibus
(GEO,
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), it was convenient to analyze the ACE2 expression profiles in
sorts of stem cells. Figure 1A showed the ACE2 expression values in different stem cells from
different projects, including human embryonic stem cells (Kim et al., 2014), iPSC (Yang et al.,
2014), human epithelial stem cells (Yang et al., 2014), human adipose stem cells (Onate et al., 2013),
human hematopoietic stem cells (Pang et al., 2011), and human mesenchymal stem cells (Bernstein
et al., 2010). The expression values of a housekeeping gene GAPDH were simultaneously collected
as controls. ACE2 was expressed in each kind of stem cells, though the expression values were
relatively low compared with GAPDH. The reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) results showed that
ACE2 was expressed in iPSC, iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) and human coronary artery
endothelial cells (HCAEC) (Figure 1B). The images from immunofluorescence assays clearly
showed that ACE2 protein was located on the cell membrane of iPSC (Figure 1C), suggesting that
the pluripotent stem cells were the potential targets of SARS-CoV-2.

To study whether physiological activities in iPSC were disturbed by nCoVN, a human induced
pluripotent stem cell line (iPSC-nCoVN) in which the expression of nCoVN could be modulated by a
Tet-On system was generated by a lentiviral expression system. In this system, nCoVN cDNA
sequence (with a 6× His Tag coding sequence) was conjugated to puromycin resistance gene through
a T2A peptide encoding sequence, and the transcription was relied on the induction of tetracycline or
doxycycline (Dox). After puromycin selection, two single cell clones were seeded in separated wells
by manual colony-picking. Sequentially, iPSC-nCoVN were divided into two groups: one was
induced by Dox for nCoVN expression (Dox), the other was added with DMSO as a control set
(DMSO), meanwhile, a GFP-expressed iPS cell line (iPSC-GFP), in which the expression of GFP
was modulated by the same Tet-On system, was used as another control set in the following assays
(Figure 2A).

The expression of nCoVN was confirmed at the mRNA and protein levels. The transcriptional level
of nCoVN was measured by Real-time PCR in iPSC, Dox, and DMSO groups, and nCoVN
expression increased about 267-fold in the Dox group compared with the DMSO group (Figure 2B).
The nCoVN protein was detected by using an anti-6× His Tag antibody in cells from the Dox group
(Supplementary Figure 1). The proliferation rate was compared among iPSC, iPSC-GFP and Dox
groups by using a cell counting kit. The absorbance at 450 nm (A450) was measured at 24 hours, 42
hours, 48 hours, 60 hours and 72 hours after cell seeding. After three days of cell seeding, Dox group
showed a decreased proliferation rate than both of iPSC and iPSC-GFP groups, indicating that
nCoVN might hamper the growth and division of iPSC (Figure 2C). This observation was consistent
with the previous finding about the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV (Zhou et al., 2008).

We continued to induce nCoVN expression in iPSC. The phase-contrast images of iPSC-nCoVN
with a 7-day, a 9-day, and an 11-day inductions (Dox) and counterpart controls (DMSO) were shown
in Figure 2D. In the DMSO group, a typical morphology of stem cells with high nucleus/cytoplasm
ratio and close cell membrane contacts was observed, while iPSC-nCoVN after a 7-day induction
started to exhibit endothelial cell morphological features and lower nucleus/cytoplasm ratio. After a
14-day induction, most of the cells exhibited distinct shapes from wild-type iPSC, such as neuronlike cells, endothelial-like cells and fibroblast-like cells (Figure 2E). These data showed that
continuous expression of nCoVN caused obvious morphological changes in iPSC.

Next, we examined the pluripotency markers in iPSC and iPSC-nCoVN. The pluripotency markers
SSEA4 and TRA-1-81, which were expressed in human embryonic stem cells and iPSC, were widely
applied in identification of pluripotent stem cells (Abujarour et al., 2013; Trusler et al., 2018). The
immunofluorescence staining images illustrated that iPSC-nCoVN completely lost the expression of
SSEA4 and TRA-1-81, namely, iPSC-nCoVN lost the pluripotency in the presence of nCoVN
(Supplementary Figure 2A, B). We traced the expression of TRA-1-81 in iPSC-nCoVN with a 2-day,
a 4-day, a 6-day, and an 8-day inductions (Figure 3A). On Day 2, TRA-1-81 was still expressed in
iPSC-nCoVN; however, from Day 4, TRA-1-81 was not detectable in most of the cells, suggesting
that the pluripotent fate of iPSC-nCoVN was determined in the first 4 days. To further test the
pluripotency in iPSC and iPSC-nCoVN, we directly differentiated these cells to cardiomyocytes by
using a routine protocol, and the differentiation assays were performed under the same conditions. As
expected, the differentiation efficiency could reach 60% in iPSC; however, on differentiation day 12,
only a very small portion of cells from iPSC-nCoVN were expressed cardiac Troponin T,

that the pluripotency maintenance of iPSC-nCoVN was disrupted by nCoVN.

Since the pluripotency lost due to short-term expression of nCoVN, we are extremely interested in
the cell fate of iPSC-nCoVN under long-term expression of nCoVN. After a 28-day induction in the
stem cell culture medium, some spindle-shaped iPSC-nCoVN, which exhibited a typical fibroblast
morphological feature, were observed (Supplementary Figure 2C). The antibodies against fibroblast
markers vimentin, alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and S100A4 were used to verify the cell type
of these fibroblast-like cells. The results from immunofluorescence assays confirmed that these
markers were expressed in nCoVN-expressing cells (Figure 4A, B, C; Supplementary Figure 2D). To
further investigate the transcriptomic profiles of iPSC-nCoVN under the long-term nCoVN
expression, doxycycline-induced iPSC-nCoVN and iPSC-GFP for 30 days were applied to RNA-seq.
Through differentially express analysis, iPSC-nCoVN showed a dramatic gene expression change
comparing with iPSC-GFP (Supplementary Table). Totally, 3,080 genes were significantly
differentially expressed (FDR<0.05, |log2FoldChange|>3). Among them, the down-regulated genes
in iPSC-nCoVN were most significantly enriched with proliferation and stem cell related pathways,
including the Yamanaka factors-associated genes, such as POU5F1, LIN28A, NANOG, and SOX2
(with a 790-fold, a 2306-fold, a 253-fold, and an 18-fold decrease, respectively) (Figure 4E); while
the extracellular matrix and extracellular matrix-associated pathway was the most significantly
enriched pathway in the up-regulated genes (Figure 4F). Next, we used RNA-seq data from the
ENCODE project to evaluate the cell type of iPSC-nCoVN. Comparing with the transcriptome of the
pluripotent stem cells and fibroblast in the ENCODE project (Consortium, 2012; Davis et al., 2018),
iPSC-GFP samples were clustered with H7 and GM23338, which were the embryonic stem cells
(ESC) and iPSC, respectively; while iPSC-nCoVN samples were clustered with multiple kinds of
fibroblast (Figure 4G). Furthermore, iPSC-nCoVN with a 40-day induction, which were kept
culturing in the stem cell medium, were totally differentiated to fibroblast (Figure 4D).

According to the current knowledge about the life cycle of SARS-CoV, the nucleocapsid protein was
translated by the host cell translation protein synthesis machinery (McBride et al., 2014; Song et al.,
2019), and was localized mainly in the cytoplasm (Rowland et al., 2005). The primary function of
nucleocapsid protein was to package the viral genome into nucleocapsids to protect the genomic
RNA (McBride et al., 2014). During the formation of nucleocapsids, numerous nucleocapsid proteins
bound to the viral RNA and started oligomerization. The viral reproductive strategies would
synthesize nucleocapsid proteins as many as possible to meet the requirements of viral assembly,
which meant the nucleocapsid proteins were overproduced. The findings that redundant nucleocapsid
proteins interfered with the normal physiology of host cells were reported (Surjit et al., 2004; Zhao et
al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007a; Zhao et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2017). In this study, we
first presented that nCoVN abolished pluripotency and reduced the proliferation rate in human
induced pluripotent stem cells. Long-term expression of nCoVN drove iPSC to fibroblast
in spite of using the stem cell culture conditions. It was reported that the nucleocapsid protein of
SARS-CoV facilitated TGF-β-induced PAI-1 expression to promote lung fibrosis (Zhao et al., 2008),
which was also the possible pathway that nCoVN turned iPSC to fibroblast.

283
284

The time-course assays showed that the pluripotency marker disappeared in four days after nCoVN
expression. This finding might be applied to a cell-based chemical screening model, in which the

candidate chemicals with potential ability to halt the iPSC differentiation caused by nCoVN are
easily identified. More importantly, SARS-CoV-2 is not necessary in this model, which means it
could be used in the routine laboratories and applied to high-throughput equipment with less risk.

In addition, how nCoVN breaks the pluripotency maintenance of iPSC is still a riddle. The
pluripotency maintenance in stem cells requires delicate regulations to maintain the balance of
pluripotency gene expression in a complicated network. Since nCoVN can bind RNAs, it is possible
that nCoVN suppresses the key pluripotency gene’s translation through occupying the particular sites
of RNAs. Although the mechanism is unknown, the toxic effects of nCoVN are clear, which reminds
us that SARS-CoV-2 might impair the reproductive system and hematopoietic system. In conclusion,
we first reported expressing nCoVN could totally change the cell fate of iPSC, which provided new
clues to help people fighting against the virus.
