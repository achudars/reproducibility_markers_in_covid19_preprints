ABSTRACT

54

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is responsible for the current worldwide coronavirus disease 2019

55

(COVID-19) pandemic, infecting millions of people and causing hundreds of thousands of

56

deaths. The Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates viral entry and is the main target for

57

neutralizing antibodies. Understanding the antibody response directed against SARS-CoV-2 is

58

crucial for the development of vaccine, therapeutic and public health interventions. Here we

59

performed a cross-sectional study on 106 SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals to evaluate humoral

60

responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike. The vast majority of infected individuals elicited anti-

61

Spike antibodies within 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms. The levels of receptor-binding

62

domain (RBD)-specific IgG persisted overtime, while the levels of anti-RBD IgM decreased

63

after symptoms resolution. Some of the elicited antibodies cross-reacted with other human

64

coronaviruses in a genus-restrictive manner. While most of individuals developed neutralizing

65

antibodies within the first two weeks of infection, the level of neutralizing activity was

66

significantly decreased over time. Our results highlight the importance of studying the

67

persistence of neutralizing activity upon natural SARS-CoV-2 infection.

MAIN

70

The first step in the replication cycle of coronaviruses is viral entry. This is mediated by

71

their trimeric Spike (S) glycoproteins. Similar to SARS-CoV, the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-

72

2 interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its host receptor (Hoffmann et al.,

73

2020; Shang et al., 2020; Walls et al., 2019). During entry, the Spike binds the host cell through

74

interaction between its receptor binding domain (RBD) and ACE2 and is cleaved by cell surface

75

proteases or endosomal cathepsins (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Ou et al., 2020; Zang et al., 2020),

76

triggering irreversible conformational changes in the S protein enabling membrane fusion and

77

viral entry (Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 Spike is very

78

immunogenic, with RBD representing the main target for neutralizing antibodies (Ju et al., 2020;

79

Shi et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020). Humoral responses are important for

80

preventing and controlling viral infections (Murin et al., 2019; Rouse and Sehrawat, 2010).

81

However, little is known about the chronology and durability of the human antibody response

82

against SARS-CoV-2.

83
84

Here we analyzed serological samples from 106 SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals at

85

different times post-symptoms onset and 10 uninfected individuals for their reactivity to SARS-

86

CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein, cross-reactivity with other human CoV (HCoV), as well as virus

87

neutralization. Samples were collected from COVID-19 positive individuals starting on March

88

2020 or healthy individuals before the COVID-19 outbreak (COVID-19 negative). Cross-

89

sectional serum samples (n=79) were collected from individuals presenting typical clinical

90

symptoms of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 1). All patients were positive for SARS-CoV-

91

2 by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal specimens. The average age of the infected patients was 55

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.08.140244; this version posted July 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

92

years old, including 33 males and 46 females. Samples were classified into 4 different time

93

points after symptoms onset: 24 (11 males, 13 females) were obtained at 2-7 days (T1, median =

94

3 days), 20 (9 males, 11 females) between 8-14 days (T2, median = 11 days), 27 (10 males, 16

95

females) between 16-30 days (T3, median = 23 days) and 9 (3 males, 6 females) between 31-43

96

days (T4, median = 36 days). Samples were also obtained from 27 convalescent patients (20

97

males, 7 females, median = 41 days), who have been diagnosed with or tested positive for

98

COVID-19 with complete resolution of symptoms for at least 14 days.

99
100

We first evaluated the presence of RBD-specific IgG and IgM antibodies by ELISA

101

(Amanat et al., 2020; Stadlbauer et al., 2020). The level of RBD-specific IgM peaked at T2 and

102

was followed by a stepwise decrease over time (T3, T4 and Convalescent) (Figure 1). Three

103

quarter of the patients had detectable anti-RBD IgM two weeks after the onset of the symptoms.

104

Similarly, 85% of patients in T2 developed anti-RBD IgG, reaching 100% in convalescent

105

patients. In contrast to IgM, the levels of RBD-specific IgG peaked at T3 and remained relatively

106

stable after complete resolution of symptoms (convalescent patients).

107
108

We next used flow cytometry to examine the ability of sera to recognize the full-length

109

SARS-CoV-2 Spike expressed at the cell surface. Briefly, 293T cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S

110

glycoproteins were stained with samples, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies

111

recognizing all antibody isotypes (including IgG, IgM and IgA). As presented in Figure 2, 54.2%

112

of the sera from T1 already contained SARS-CoV-2 full Spike-reactive antibodies. Interestingly,

113

the majority of patients from T2, T3, T4 and convalescent groups were found to be seropositive

114

in agreement with previous report (Grzelak et al., 2020). The higher seropositivity detected by

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.08.140244; this version posted July 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

115

flow cytometry is most likely due to the detection of antibodies of multiple specificity and of

116

different isotypes simultaneously. Antibody levels targeting the SARS-CoV-2 Spike significantly

117

increased from T1 to T2/T3 and remained relatively stable thereafter. As expected, the levels of

118

antibodies recognizing the full Spike correlated with the presence of both RBD-specific IgG and

119

IgM (Figure S1). We also evaluated potential cross-reactivity against the closely related SARS-

120

CoV Spike. None of the COVID-19 negative samples recognized the SARS-CoV Spike. While

121

the reactivity of COVID-19+ samples to SARS-CoV S was lower than for SARS-CoV-2 S, it

122

followed a similar progression and significantly correlated with their reactivity to SARS-CoV-2

123

full Spike or RBD protein (Figure 2 and S1). This indicates that SARS-CoV-2-elicited antibodies

124

cross-react with human Sarbecoviruses. This was also observed with another Betacoronavirus

125

(OC43) but not with Alphacoronavirus (NL63, 229E) S glycoproteins, suggesting a genus-

126

restrictive cross-reactivity (Figure 2C and S1). Of note, anti-OC43 RBD antibodies did not

127

fluctuate upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure S2). Therefore, this differential cross-reactivity

128

could be explained by the high degree of conservation in the S protein fusion machinery,

129

particularly in the S2 subunit among Betacoronaviruses (Jaimes et al., 2020; Madu et al., 2009;

130

Zhou et al., 2020).

131
132

We next measured the capacity of patient samples to neutralize pseudoparticles bearing

133

SARS-CoV-2 S, SARS-CoV S or VSV-G glycoproteins using 293T cells stably expressing

134

ACE2 as target cells (Figure 3 and S3). Neutralizing activity, as measured by the neutralization

135

half-maximum inhibitory dilution (ID50) or the neutralization 80% inhibitory dilution (ID80), was

136

detected in most patients within 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms (T2, T3, T4 and

137

Convalescent patients) (Figure 3). SARS-CoV-2 neutralization was specific since no

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.08.140244; this version posted July 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

138

neutralization was observed against pseudoparticles expressing VSV-G. The capacity to

139

neutralize SARS-CoV-2 S-pseudotyped particles significantly correlated with the presence of

140

RBD-specific IgG/IgM and anti-S antibodies (Figure S4). While the percentage of patients

141

eliciting neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Spike remained relatively stable 2 weeks

142

after disease symptom onset (T2, T3, T4 and Convalescent patients), neutralizing antibody titers

143

significantly decreased after 1 month of infection (T4) or after the complete resolution of

144

symptoms as observed in the convalescent patients (Figure 3G and 3H). Similarly to RBD-

145

specific IgM, levels of RBD-specific IgA were also found to peak at T2 and decrease over time.

146

However, RBD-specific IgM levels displayed a stronger correlation with neutralization acitivity

147

compared to RBD-specific IgG and IgA, suggesting a more prominent role for IgM, but the

148

decrease in IgA could also contribute to the loss of neutralization activity as recently suggested

149

(Sterlin et al., 2020). Cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV S protein (Figure

150

2B) were also detected in some SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, but with significantly lower

151

potency and waned over time. We note that around 40% of convalescent patients did not exhibit

152

any neutralizing activity. This suggests that the production of neutralizing antibodies is not a

153

prerequisite to the resolution of the infection and that other arms of the immune system could be

154

sufficient to control the infection in an important proportion of the population.

155
156

To determine whether underlying correlation patterns among antibody responses detected

157

in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals were associated with demographic and clinical parameters,

158

we performed a comprehensive correlation analysis, focusing on data from the acute stages of

159

SARS-CoV-2 infection (T1, T2, T3 and T4) (Figure 4 & S5). This analysis revealed a prominent

160

cluster of positive correlations between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and OC43 Spike antibody

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.08.140244; this version posted July 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

161

binding, SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, and days post-symptoms onset (Figure S5). The cluster

162

became evident in a linear correlation analysis involving all study parameters (Figure S5A). Of

163

interest, clinical parameters formed another cluster of positive correlations between respiratory

164

symptoms, hospitalization, oxygen supplementation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission

165

(Figure S5A). The presence of respiratory symptoms and hospitalization also correlated with age

166

of the infected patients. Studying the network of immunologic and clinical correlation pairs

167

longitudinally (from T1 to T4), we observed an increased diversification of associations between

168

the parameters (Figure 4B-E), Associations between anti-Spike Abs and clinical parameters

169

enhanced overtime and was more prominent 3 weeks after the onset of the symptoms (T3 & T4).

170

Admission to the ICU was significantly associated with levels of RBD-specific IgM and IgG and

171

total SARS-CoV-2 Spike Abs (Figure 4A & S5A). The presence of respiratory symptoms was

172

linked to higher levels of RBD-specific IgM and of neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2

173

S (Figure 4A). Indeed, neutralizers (patients with detectable neutralization ID50 against SARS-

174

CoV-2) were found to have stronger antibody responses and were more inclined to present

175

respiratory symptoms (Figure S6).

176
177

This study helps to better understand the kinetics and persistence of humoral responses

178

directed against SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1, 2 & 3). Our results reveal that the vast majority of

179

infected individuals are able to elicit antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2 Spike within 2

180

weeks after symptom onset and persist after the resolution of the infection. Accordingly, all

181

tested convalescent patients were found to be seropositive. As expected, RBD-specific IgM

182

levels decreased over the duration of the study while IgG remained relatively stable. Our results

183

highlight how SARS-CoV-2 Spike, like other coronaviruses, appears to be relatively easily

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.08.140244; this version posted July 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

184

recognized by Abs present in sera from infected individuals. This was suggested to be linked to

185

the higher processing of glycans compared to other type I fusion protein, such as HIV-1 Env,

186

Influenza A HA or filoviruses GP (Watanabe et al., 2020a; Watanabe et al., 2020b). The ease of

187

naturally-elicited Abs to recognize the Spike might be associated with the low rate of somatic

188

hypermutation observed in neutralizing Abs (Ju et al., 2020). This low somatic hypermutation

189

rate could in turn explain why the majority of the SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals are able to

190

generate neutralizing antibodies within only two weeks after infection (Figure 3). In contrast, the

191

development of potent neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 Env usually requires 2-3 years of

192

infection and require a high degree of somatic hypermutation (Sok and Burton, 2018).

193

Nevertheless, in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the neutralization capacity decreases

194

significantly 6 weeks after the onset of symptoms, following a similar trend as anti-RBD IgM

195

(Figure 1 & 3). Interestingly, anti-RBD IgM presented a stronger correlation with neutralization

196

than IgG and IgA (Figure S4A,C), suggesting that at least part of the neutralizing activity is

197

mediated by IgM. The neutralization activity appears to further decrease after the resolution of

198

symptoms as recently reported in a series of longitudinal studies on convalescent patients

199

(Beaudoin-Bussières et al., 2020; Ibarrondo et al., 2020; Long et al., 2020; Perreault et al., 2020;

200

Yin et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). However, it remains unclear whether this reduced level of

201

neutralizing activity would remain sufficient to protect from re-infection.

239

Ethics statement

240

All work was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki in terms of informed

241

consent and approval by an appropriate institutional board. In addition, this study was conducted

242

in accordance with the rules and regulations concerning ethical reviews in Quebec, particularly

243

those specified in the Civil Code (http://legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/fr/ShowDoc/cs/CCQ-1991) and

244

in subsequent IRB practice. Informed Consent was obtained for all participating subjects and the

245

study was approved by Quebec Public health authorities. Convalescent plasmas were obtained

246

from donors who consented to participate in this research project (REB # 2020-004). The donors

247

were recruited by Héma-Québec and met all donor eligibility criteria for routine apheresis

248

plasma donation, plus two additional criteria: previous confirmed COVID-19 infection and

249

complete resolution of symptoms for at least 14 days. Plasma samples from COVID- children

250

were obtained from donors enrolled in a research protocol from CHU Ste-Justine (REB #3195).

251
252

Plasmids

253

The plasmids expressing the human coronavirus Spikes of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, NL63 and

254

229E were previously reported (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Hofmann et al., 2005). The OC43 Spike

255

with an N-terminal 3xFlag tag and C-terminal 17 residue deletion was cloned into pCAGGS

256

following amplification of the spike gene from pB-Cyst-3FlagOC43SC17 (kind gift of James M.

257

Rini, University of Toronto, ON, Canada). The plasmid encoding for SARS-CoV-2 S RBD

258

(residues 319-541) fused with a hexahistidine tag was reported elsewhere (Amanat et al., 2020).

259

The sequence for the HCoV OC43 RBD was obtained from the UniProt Protein Database

GenScript and cloned into the pcDNA3.1 plasmid between EcoRI and XhoI sites. The vesicular

264

stomatitis virus G (VSV-G)-encoding plasmid (pSVCMV-IN-VSV-G) was previously described

265

(Lodge et al., 1997). The lentiviral packaging plasmids pLP1 and pLP2, coding for HIV-1

266

gag/pol and rev respectively, were purchased from Invitrogen. The transfer plasmid (pLenti-C-

267

mGFP-P2A-Puro-ACE2) encoding for human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) fused

268

with a mGFP C-terminal tag and a puromycin selection marker was purchased from OriGene.

269
270

Cell lines

271

293T human embryonic kidney cells (obtained from ATCC) were maintained at 37°C under 5%

272

CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Wisent) containing 5% fetal bovine

273

serum (VWR) and 100 μg/ml of penicillin-streptomycin (Wisent). For the generation of 293T

274

cells stably expressing human ACE2, transgenic lentivirus were produced in 293T using a third-

275

generation lentiviral vector system. Briefly, 293T cells were co-transfected with two packaging

276

plasmids (pLP1 and pLP2), an envelope plasmid (pSVCMV-IN-VSV-G) and a lentiviral transfer

277

plasmid coding for human ACE2 (pLenti-C-mGFP-P2A-Puro-ACE2) (OriGene). Forty-eight

278

hours post-transfection, supernatant containing lentiviral particles was used to infect more 293T

279

cells in presence of 5µg/mL polybrene. Stably transduced cells were enriched upon puromycin

280

selection. 293T-ACE2 cells were then cultured in a medium supplemented with 2 μg/ml of

281

puromycin (Sigma).

Protein expression and purification

284

FreeStyle 293F cells (Invitrogen) were grown in FreeStyle 293F medium (Invitrogen) to a

285

density of 1 x 106 cells/mL at 37°C with 8 % CO2 with regular agitation (150 rpm). Cells were

286

transfected with a plasmid coding for SARS-CoV-2 S RBD or OC43 S RBD using

287

ExpiFectamine 293 transfection reagent, as directed by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). One week

288

later, cells were pelleted and discarded. Supernatants were filtered using a 0.22 µm filter

289

(Thermo Fisher Scientific). The recombinant RBD proteins were purified by nickel affinity

290

columns, as directed by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). The RBD preparations were dialyzed

291

against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stored in aliquots at -80°C until further use. To

292

assess purity, recombinant proteins were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie

293

Blue. For cell-surface staining, RBD proteins were fluorescently labelled with Alexa Fluor 594

294

(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

295
296

Sera and antibodies

297

Sera from SARS-CoV-2-infected and uninfected donors were collected, heat-inactivated for 1

298

hour at 56 °C and stored at -80°C until ready to use in subsequent experiments. The monoclonal

299

antibodies CR3022 and 4.3E4 were used as positive controls in ELISA assays and were

300

previously described (Desforges et al., 2013; ter Meulen et al., 2006; Tian et al., 2020; Yuan et

301

al., 2020). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody specific for the Fc region of

302

human IgG (Invitrogen), for the Fc region of human IgM (Jackson ImmunoReasearch) or for the

303

Fc region of human IgA (Jackson ImmunoResearch) were used as secondary antibodies to detect

304

sera binding in ELISA experiments. Alexa Fluor-647-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (H+L)

305

Abs (Invitrogen) were used as secondary antibodies to detect sera binding in flow cytometry

ELISA assay

310

Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S RBD proteins (or OC43 S RBD proteins) (2.5μg/ml), or bovine

311

serum albumin (BSA) (2.5μg/ml) as a negative control, were prepared in PBS and were

312

adsorbed to plates (MaxiSorp; Nunc) overnight at 4°C. Coated wells were subsequently blocked

313

with blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline [TBS] containing 0.1% Tween20 and 2% BSA) for 1h

314

at room temperature. Wells were then washed four times with washing buffer (Tris-buffered

315

saline [TBS] containing 0.1% Tween20). CR3022 mAb (50ng/ml) or sera from SARS-CoV-2-

316

infected or uninfected donors (1/100; 1/250; 1/500; 1/1000; 1/2000; 1/4000) were diluted in

317

blocking buffer and incubated with the RBD-coated wells for 1h at room temperature. Plates

318

were washed four times with washing buffer followed by incubation with secondary Abs (diluted

319

in blocking buffer) for 1h at room temperature, followed by four washes. HRP enzyme activity

320

was determined after the addition of a 1:1 mix of Western Lightning oxidizing and luminol

321

reagents (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). Light emission was measured with a LB941 TriStar

322

luminometer (Berthold Technologies). Signal obtained with BSA was subtracted for each serum

323

and were then normalized to the signal obtained with CR3022 mAb present in each plate.

324

Alternatively, the signal obtained with each serum on OC43 RBD was normalized with the

325

signal obtained with 4.3E4 mAb present in each plate. The seropositivity threshold was

326

established using the following formula: mean RLU of all COVID-19 negative sera normalized

327

to CR3022 (or 4.3E4) + (3 standard deviations of the mean of all COVID-19 negative sera).

Flow cytometry analysis of cell-surface staining

330

Using the standard calcium phosphate method, 10μg of Spike expressor and 2μg of a green

331

fluorescent protein (GFP) expressor (pIRES-GFP) was transfected into 2 × 106 293T cells. At

332

48h post transfection, 293T cells were stained with sera from SARS-CoV-2-infected or

333

uninfected individuals (1:250 dilution). The percentage of transfected cells (GFP+ cells) was

334

determined by gating the living cell population based on the basis of viability dye staining (Aqua

335

Vivid, Invitrogen). Samples were acquired on a LSRII cytometer (BD Biosciences, Mississauga,

336

ON, Canada) and data analysis was performed using FlowJo vX.0.7 (Tree Star, Ashland, OR,

337

USA). The seropositivity threshold was established using the following formula: (mean of all

338

COVID-19 negative sera + (3 standard deviation of the mean of all COVID-19 negative sera) +

339

inter-assay coefficient of variability).

340
341

Virus neutralization assay

342

Target cells were infected with single-round luciferase-expressing lentiviral particles. Briefly,

343

293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with the lentiviral vector pNL4.3

344

R-E- Luc (NIH AIDS Reagent Program) and a plasmid encoding for SARS-CoV-2 Spike,

345

SARS-CoV Spike or VSV-G at a ratio of 5:4. Two days post-transfection, cell supernatants were

346

harvested and stored at –80°C until use. 293T-ACE2 target cells were seeded at a density of

347

1×104 cells/well in 96-well luminometer-compatible tissue culture plates (Perkin Elmer) 24h

348

before infection. Recombinant viruses in a final volume of 100μl were incubated with the

349

indicated sera dilutions (1/50; 1/250; 1/1250; 1/6250; 1/31250) for 1h at 37°C and were then

350

added to the target cells followed by incubation for 48h at 37°C; cells were lysed by the addition

351

of 30μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega) followed by one freeze-thaw cycle. An LB941 TriStar

352

luminometer (Berthold Technologies) was used to measure the luciferase activity of each well

353

after the addition of 100μl of luciferin buffer (15mM MgSO4, 15mM KPO4 [pH 7.8], 1mM ATP,

354

and 1mM dithiothreitol) and 50μl of 1mM d-luciferin potassium salt (Prolume). The

355

neutralization half-maximal inhibitory dilution (ID50) or the neutralization 80% inhibitory

356

dilution (ID80) represents the sera dilution to inhibit 50% or 80% of the infection of 293T-ACE2

357

cells by recombinant viruses bearing the indicated surface glycoproteins.

Software Scripts and Visualization

360

Correlograms were generated using the corrplot package in program R and R Studio (R Core

361

Team, 2013; R Studio Team, 2015). Dendrograms were calculated using the dendPlot function

362

and hclust method, or as implemented in the heatmap package in R. Chord diagrams were

363

generated in R and R Studio based on the circlize and ComplexHeatmap package, as recently

364

described. For time series, area graphs were generated using RawGraphs with DensityDesign

365

interpolation and the implemented normalization using vertically un-centered values (Mauri et

366

al., 2017). Forrest plots and calculations of fold change, significance (Mann-Whitney) and

367

adjusted P values (Holm-Sidak) were done using Excel and Prism v8.2.0. The confidence

368

interval of a quotient of two means was calculated based on the Fieller method using GraphPad

369

QuickCalcs.

371

Statistical analyses

372

Statistics were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 8.0.2 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, (USA).

373

Every data set was tested for statistical normality and this information was used to apply the

374

appropriate (parametric or nonparametric) statistical test. P values <0.05 were considered

Pseudoviral particles coding for the luciferase reporter gene and bearing the following

511

glycoproteins: (A, D, G, H) SARS-CoV-2 S, (B, E, I) SARS-CoV S or (C, F) VSV-G were used

512

to infect 293T-ACE2 cells. Pseudoviruses were incubated with serial dilutions of samples from

513

COVID-19 negative or COVID-19 positive patients (T1, T2, T3, T4, Convalescent) at 37°C for

514
