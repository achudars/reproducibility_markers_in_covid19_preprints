SUMMARY
Many host RNA sensors are positioned in the cytosol to detect viral RNA during
infection. However, most positive-strand RNA viruses replicate within a modified organelle coopted from intracellular membranes of the endomembrane system, which shields viral products
from host cell innate immune sensors. Targeting innate RNA sensors to the endomembrane
system may enhance their ability to sense viral RNA generated by viruses that use these
compartments for replication. Here, we reveal that an isoform of oligoadenylate synthetase 1,
OAS1 p46, is prenylated and targeted to the endomembrane system. Membrane localization of
OAS1 p46 confers enhanced access to viral replication sites and results in increased antiviral
activity against a subset of RNA viruses including flavivirus, picornavirus, and SARS-CoV-2.
Finally, our human genetic analysis shows that the OAS1 splice-site SNP responsible for
production of the OAS1 p46 isoform strongly associates with COVID-19 severity. This study
highlights the importance of endomembrane targeting for the antiviral specificity of OAS1 and
suggests early control of SARS-CoV-2 replication through OAS1-p46 is an important
determinant of COVID-19 severity.

INTRODUCTION
Oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) proteins are a family of interferon-induced innate
immune sensors of viral RNA sensors critical for cell-intrinsic innate immune defense against
viruses through activation of the latent endoribonuclease RNase L (Hornung et al., 2014).
Recognition of viral RNA induces a conformational change in OAS proteins to reveal a catalytic
pocket which converts ATP to the second messenger 2′-5′A (Lohofener et al., 2015). Binding to
2′-5′A dimerizes and activates RNase L, which cleaves cellular and viral RNA in order to block
viral replication Oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) proteins are a family of innate viral RNA
sensors critical for cell-intrinsic defense against viruses through activation of the latent
endoribonuclease RNase L (Hornung et al., 2014). Recognition of viral RNA induces a
conformational change in OAS proteins to reveal a catalytic pocket where ATP is converted to
the second messenger 2′-5′A (Lohofener et al., 2015). Binding to 2′-5′A dimerizes and activates
RNase L, which proceeds to cleave cellular and viral RNA in order to block viral replication
(Han et al., 2014). Although the importance of RNase L in restricting a variety of viruses is well
documented, it is unclear how individual OAS proteins contribute to this breadth of antiviral
activity (Silverman, 2007). Interestingly, the C-terminal region of human OAS1 is alternatively
spliced to produce the protein isoforms p42, p44, p46, p48, and p52, named according to their
molecular weight (Bonnevie-Nielsen et al., 2005). All human OAS1 isoforms share the first five
exons of OAS1, which contain the RNA binding and catalytic domains, but each isoform splices
a distinct sixth exon to generate unique C-termini. The specific antiviral roles of individual
human OAS1 isoforms are not defined. The production of OAS1 p46 is controlled by a SNP in
the splice-acceptor site of exon 6 in OAS1 (rs10774671 A>G). This splice site SNP in OAS1 has
been shown associated with genetic susceptibility to multiple flaviviruses and autoimmunity (El
Awady et al., 2011; Haralambieva et al., 2011; Lim et al.; Liu et al., 2017; Simon-Loriere et al.,
2015). The G allele of this SNP shifts the splice acceptor site in exon 6 by one nucleotide to
generate p46, while other OAS1 isoforms, primarily p42, are produced when the A allele is
present (Lim et al., 2009). OAS1 p46 is unique among OAS1 isoforms because it is the only
isoform with a C-terminal CaaX (cysteine-aliphatic-aliphatic-any residue) motif. Proteins
containing CaaX motifs at their C-termini undergo post-translational lipidation termed
prenylation and are targeted to the cytosolic face of intracellular organellar membranes of the
endomembrane system following post-prenylation processing at the endoplasmic reticulum
(Wang and Casey, 2016). The significance of the CaaX motif in OAS1 p46 and whether
endomembrane targeting might alter the antiviral activity of OAS1 is unknown. OAS1 p46 is

How the subcellular targeting of OAS family members impacts their specificity and
antiviral activity is unclear. Most intracellular viral RNA (vRNA) sensors localize to the cytosol
where they are poised to sense accumulating vRNA during infection (Ablasser and Hur, 2020;
Chan and Gack, 2016). However, since many RNA viruses replicate their RNA in close
association with intracellular membranes, placing OAS proteins at membranous compartments
may augment vRNA sensing in certain contexts. Notably, positive-strand RNA viruses, such as
flaviviruses, picornaviruses, and coronaviruses replicate their RNA within modified host
organelles of the endomembrane system (Romero-Brey and Bartenschlager, 2014). These
replication organelles pose a problem for cytosolic innate immune sensors as they shield vRNA
from detection by sensors such as RIG-I (Neufeldt et al., 2016). Whether or not the host has
evolved strategies to survey specific intracellular membranes for viral replication is unclear. We
therefore hypothesized OAS1 p46, through its CaaX motif, is targeted to the endomembrane
system and this targeting gives it enhanced access to vRNA during infection. In support of this
model, we show the prenylated isoform, OAS1 p46, is targeted to Golgi membranes and this
membrane-targeting results in enhanced detection of vRNA and augmented antiviral activity
against positive-strand RNA viruses such as flaviviruses, picornaviruses, and SARS-CoV-2. Our
human genetic data further supports the contribution of OAS1 rs10774671 to severity of COVID19. More broadly, this work reveals how intracellular membrane targeting of OAS1 is critical for
detecting human pathogenic viruses that replicate on organellar membranes.

RESULTS
OAS1 p42 and p46 are the major OAS1 isoforms.
Alignment of the C-terminal regions of the five OAS1 isoforms revealed a C-terminal
CaaX motif present only in the p46 isoform, which may target this isoform to intracellular
membranes (Figures 1A, S1A, and S1C). OAS1 proteins from diverse vertebrate species have a
CaaX motif at their C-termini, suggesting the CaaX motif has a critical role in the function of
OAS1 (Figure S1B). We determined the protein expression of OAS1 isoforms across several
human cell lines and assessed the impact of the SNP (rs10774671) on the expression of OAS1
isoforms. This SNP is in the splice acceptor site of exon 6 in OAS1 and the G allele controls the
production of the p46 isoform (Lim et al., 2009). Genotyping revealed the A549 cell line carried
only the A allele, PH5CH8 and THP-1 cell lines carried both the A and G alleles, and Daudi cells
carried only the G allele at rs10774671 (Figure 1B). We treated these cell lines with recombinant
human interferon beta (rIFNβ) and evaluated OAS1 protein expression by immunoblot using an
N-terminal OAS1 antibody that recognizes all isoforms. We detected two OAS1 isoforms at
molecular weights of 42 and 46 kDa in cells with at least one copy of the G allele, and only p42
or p46 were expressed in A/A or G/G cells respectively after rIFNb treatment or Sendai virus
infection (Figures 1B and S1D). We did not observe the expression of other OAS1 isoforms
under these conditions. We confirmed the SNP dependent expression in human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) homozygous for either allele at rs10774671 after treatment with

rIFNβ for 24h. Cells homozygous for the A allele only produced p42, while cells homozygous
for the G allele only produced p46 (Figure 1C). OAS1 KO 293T cells generated by
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing (Figure S1E) were used to ectopically express OAS1 p42 and p46 as
positive controls (Figure 1C). Interestingly, as observed in cell-lines, PBMCs had stronger
expression of p46 harboring at least one G allele, which may be influenced by splice site
preference or mRNA stability. We did not observe expression of the p44, p48, or p52 isoforms
consistent with previous reports demonstrating that these isoforms are weakly expressed at the
mRNA level, and unstable at the protein level (Carey et al., 2019; Li et al., 2017).
The OAS1 p46 isoform is geranylgeranylated.
One of the major differences between OAS1 p42 and p46 is the presence of a C-terminal CaaX
motif in p46 (Figure S1C). Proteins containing CaaX motifs at their C-termini are prenylated and
targeted to the cytosolic face of cellular membranes of the endomembrane system, including the
endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (Wang and Casey, 2016). Depending on the identity
of the “X” amino acid, CaaX-containing proteins are subjected to two types of prenylation,
farnesylation or geranylgeranylation. CaaX motifs with a leucine in the “X” position, as
observed for p46, ar preferentially geranylgeranylated by geranylgeranyl transferase I (GGTaseI)
One of the major differences between OAS1 p42 and p46 is the presence of a C-terminal CaaX
motif in p46 (Figure S1C). Proteins containing CaaX motifs at their C-termini are prenylated at
the ER and targeted to the cytosolic face of cellular membranes of the endomembrane system,
including the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (Wang and Casey, 2016). Depending
on the identity of the “X” amino acid, CaaX-containing proteins can be either farnesylated or
geranylgeranylated by the respective farnesyl or geranylgeranyl transferases. CaaX motifs with a
leucine in the “X” position are preferentially geranylgeranylated by geranylgeranyl transferase I
(GGTaseI) (Hartman et al., 2005 ). In order to test if the CaaX motif in p46 is
geranylgeranylated, we performed an in vitro geranylgeranylation detection assay using a click
chemistry approach (DeGraw et al., 2010). OAS1 KO 293T cells were transfected with Nterminal FLAG-tagged OAS1 p42, p46, p42CTIL, and p46ATIL expression constructs. The
p42CTIL construct represents p42 with the addition of the CaaX (CTIL) motif from p46, which
will allow us to test if the CaaX motif from p46 is sufficient to drive geranylgeranylation of p42.
The p46ATIL construct was generated by mutating the CaaX cysteine to an alanine (C->A) to
disrupt its prenylation, allowing us to test if this motif is necessary for its geranylgeranylation.
Immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitated OAS1 proteins revealed CaaX-containing p46 and
p42CTIL proteins were geranylgeranylated, while p42 and p46ATIL were not (Figure 1D).
These data confirm p46, but not p42, is geranylgeranylated and demonstrate the CaaX motif is
necessary and sufficient for the geranylgeranylation of OAS1.

OAS1 p46 localizes to the endomembrane system.
Based on the differential geranylgeranylation of the p42 and p46 OAS1 isoforms, we
hypothesized these proteins would localize to unique subcellular compartments. Since we

verified which OAS1 isoforms are produced in primary human fibroblasts and several human
cell lines, we could stratify these cells into those producing p42 and or p46 based on if the cells
harbored the A or the G allele at rs10774671. Primary human fibroblasts, PH5CH8, and THP-1,
harboring both A and G alleles all produced p42 and p46, while primary human fibroblasts and
A549 cells that carried only A allele only produced p42 (Figures 1B, 2D and S2C). We used
these cells to evaluate if OAS1 isoforms localize to different compartments under endogenous
expression conditions using confocal laser scanning microscopy (cLSM). We observed OAS1
localization at a perinuclear compartment in p46-producing cells after rIFNβ treatment, while, in
contrast, OAS1 localized to the cytosol and nucleus in cells incapable of producing p46 (Figure
S1F and S2C). Co-staining with Golgin-97, a marker of the trans-Golgi network, identified this
organelle as a site of OAS1 localization in p46-producing cells (Figures 1E, 1F, S1G and S2C).
Cells capable of producing p46 showed a significant increase in OAS1 co-localization with the
Golgi over that in A549 cells that only produce p42 (Figures 1E, 1F, S1G and S2C). Previous
reports have suggested mitochondrial localization, which is not observed in our extensive
imaging analysis (Kjaer et al., 2014; Kjaer et al., 2009). These data demonstrate OAS1 localizes
to an intracellular organelle membrane in cells capable of producing p46.
The endogenous localization patterns of OAS1 suggested the p42 and p46 isoforms
localize to distinct subcellular compartments, a hypothesis we tested by performing cLSM on
OAS1 KO Huh7 cells ectopically expressing p42 or p46 (Figures 1G, 1H and S1H). OAS1
localized to the Golgi in cells ectopically expressing p46, while the p42 isoform localized to the
cytosol and the nucleus (Figures 1G and 1H). Compared with p42, p46 showed significantly
stronger localization to the Golgi (Figures 1G and 1H). We next tested the contribution of the
CaaX motif to the Golgi localization of p46 by expressing the CaaX mutant p46ATIL (C>A) and
evaluating its localization by microscopy. p46ATIL instead localized to the cytosol and nucleus,
similar to p42, indicating the CaaX motif is necessary for the Golgi localization of p46 (Figures
1G and 1H). We then tested if adding the CaaX motif to the p42 isoform is sufficient to localize
p42CTIL to the Golgi. Consistent with our hypothesis, ectopically expressed p42CTIL localized
to the Golgi and showed significantly stronger co-localization with the Golgi over p42,
confirming the CaaX motif is both necessary and sufficient to localize OAS1 isoforms to the
Golgi (Figures 1G and 1H). These findings were further confirmed in OAS1 KO A549 cells
ectopically expressing p42, p46, p42CTIL, and p46ATIL (Figures S1I, S1J, and S1K). The p44,
p48, and p52 isoforms, which also lack a CaaX motif, localized to the cytosol and nucleus in
manner similar to p42 when ectopically expressed in OAS1 KO Huh7 cells (Figures S1L and
S1M). These experiments demonstrate the p46 isoform of OAS1 localizes to the endomembrane
system, particularly the Golgi, in a prenylation-dependent manner.
OAS1 p42 and p46 are differentially antiviral.
The differential localization of OAS1 isoforms led us to hypothesize these isoforms have
differential antiviral activity. Specifically, localization of p46 to the endomembrane system led
us to hypothesize this isoform may have enhanced antiviral activity against viruses that use these

organelle membranes for replication. Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) is a positive-strand
RNA virus sensitive to the OAS/RNase L pathway and EMCV replicates on organelles of the
endomembrane system, particularly ER and Golgi membranes (Chebath et al., 1987; Melia et al.,
2018). We used this virus to investigate whether OAS1 isoforms confer different antiviral
activity against a virus that uses the endomembrane system for replication. We transfected
expression plasmids encoding p42, p46, or an empty vector control in OAS1 KO 293T cells, and
infected with EMCV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 at 24h post-transfection
(Figure 2A). At 24h post-infection, total RNA and culture supernatants were collected for RTqPCR of EMCV RNA or plaque assay, respectively. We found p42 expression led to a
significant five-fold reduction in EMCV RNA over control, while p46 expression led to a
significant 50-fold reduction over EV and a significant 10-fold reduction over p42 at 24h postinfection (Figure 2B). Quantification of viral titer from supernatants by plaque assay showed p46
expression led to a significant 100-fold reduction in EMCV titer over control and a significant
50-fold reduction over p42. In contrast, the p42 isoform reduced EMCV titer by five-fold over
control (Figures 2C and S2A). We also compared the antiviral activity of p44, p48, and p52
against EMCV over a range of doses and found their antiviral activity was inferior to p46
(Figures 2D and 2E). These data demonstrate that, among OAS1 isoforms, OAS1 p46 confers
the strongest antiviral activity against EMCV.
Next, we tested the ability of endogenously expressed OAS1 isoforms to restrict EMCV
using an siRNA knockdown approach in THP-1 cells (A/G at rs10774671), which express both
the p42 and p46 isoforms. We transfected PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages with siRNAs
against both OAS1 isoforms, or p42 or p46 alone, and then infected with EMCV (Figure 2F).
Knockdown of total OAS1 or p46 led to a significant four-fold increase in viral titer compared to
a non-targeting control (NC), whereas specific knockdown of p42 had no effect on viral titer
compared to NC siRNA (Figures 2G and S2B). Finally, we tested if the G allele at rs10774671
correlates with resistance to EMCV in primary human fibroblasts isolated from six donors (3
A/A, 3 A/G). Quantification of EMCV RNA and viral titer at 24h post-infection revealed that
cells with at least one copy of the G allele had reduced levels of EMCV burden (Figures 2H and
2I). These data show major antiviral differences in OAS1 isoforms at endogenous levels of
expression and support an important role for p46, but not p42, in restricting a virus that utilizes
the endomembrane system for replication.

The antiviral function of OAS1 isoforms requires catalytic activity and RNase L.
The differences in the antiviral activity and localization of OAS1 p42 and p46 led us to
hypothesize that these isoforms may utilize unique antiviral mechanisms. Both RNase L and 2′5′A independent antiviral mechanisms have been documented for OAS proteins, but whether
human OAS1 p42 and p46 isoforms differentially utilize 2′-5′A or RNase L is unknown (Carey
et al., 2019; Elbahesh et al., 2011; Kristiansen et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2009). In order to ablate
catalytic activity and test if both OAS1 isoforms required 2′-5′A synthetase activity to be
antiviral, we mutated two key aspartic acid residues required for synthetase activity, D75 and

D77, in the catalytic core of p42 and p46 to alanine (D75A; A76A; D77A) which we will refer to
as catalytic mutant hereafter (Sarkar et al., 1999). We expressed these catalytically inactive
OAS1 isoforms alongside their corresponding wild type constructs in OAS1 KO 293T cells and
tested their ability to restrict EMCV (Figure 3A). As before, expression of p42 and p46 reduced
EMCV RNA and titer to different degrees. However, the catalytically inactive OAS1 constructs
failed to restrict EMCV RNA or titer (Figures 3B and 3C). Furthermore, the catalytic mutants
failed to reduce EMCV RNA compared to their wild type counterparts over a range of protein
expression levels (Figures S3A and S3B). These data indicate that the ability to synthesize 2′-5′A
is essential for the antiviral activity of OAS1 p42 and p46 against EMCV.
We next tested if p42 and p46 require RNase L for their antiviral activity by expressing
p42 or p46 in RNase L-deficient 293T cells (Figures 3D and S3C). Compared to non-targeted
Cas9 control cells, expression of p42 and p46 in RNASEL KO 293T cells had no impact on
EMCV vRNA or titers (Figures 3E and 3F). Next, we tested if RNase L expression was
sufficient to rescue the antiviral activity of OAS1 isoforms in these cells. RNASEL KO 293T
cells complemented with RNase L and expressing p46 showed a significant reduction in EMCV
RNA and titer over control. Although not significant, complementing p42 expressing cells with
RNase L showed a trend in reducing viral RNA and titer (Figures S3D, S3E, and S3F). These
experiments show that RNase L is required for the antiviral activity of OAS1 p42 and p46
against EMCV.
Although the RNA binding and catalytic domains are identical between the p42 and p46,
we tested if the distinct C-terminal regions of these isoforms could affect their enzymatic
activity. To this end, we performed 2¢-5¢A synthetase activity assays of p42, p46, and their
respective CaaX mutants. As expected, these isoforms shared a similar capacity to synthesize 2¢5¢A and the CaaX motif did not alter the catalytic activity (Figure 3G).
Cleavage of cellular RNA by RNase L has been shown to generate immunostimulatory
RNAs that are sensed by RIG-I and MDA5 and increase antiviral protection through the
production of interferon (Malathi et al., 2007). To determine if the differences in antiviral
activity of p42 and p46 could be explained by differential production of immunostimulatory
RNAs, we tested the antiviral activity of p42 and p46 in wild type or IRF3 KO 293FT cells
(Figure 3H). In wild type cells, overexpression of p42 and p46 reduced EMCV RNA
significantly over the control. Importantly, loss of IRF3 expression did not impede the ability of
p46 to restrict EMCV, as EMCV RNA was significantly reduced over control in IRF3 KO cells
expressing p46 (Figure 3I). Expression of p42 in IRF3 KO cells showed a trend towards reducing
EMCV RNA (Figure 3I). These data confirm p42 and p46 confer antiviral activity in the absence
of additional factors that are induced by IRF3. Collectively, these data demonstrate that p42 and
p46 both use the 2′-5′A/RNase L pathway and have a similar capacity to synthesize 2′-5′A to
confer antiviral activity. This suggests that some other feature must be important for their
differential antiviral activities.

Endomembrane targeting of p46 through the CaaX motif enhances access to viral RNA.
Since the CaaX motif localizes p46 to the endomembrane system, we investigated if this
motif played a role in the enhanced antiviral activity of p46 against EMCV. During picornavirus
infection, ER- and Golgi-derived membranes form replication organelles that are sites of vRNA
replication (Melia et al., 2019; Melia et al., 2018) .synthesis (Melia et al., 2019; Melia et al.,
2018). Therefore, we hypothesized that endomembrane localization of p46 places this viral RNA
sensor on membranes utilized by EMCV for replication and would allow p46 enhanced access to
EMCV RNA. In contrast, p42 would have limited access to vRNA as it is localized to the cytosol
and nucleus. We determined the localization of p42 and p46 during EMCV infection by infecting
OAS1 KO Huh7 cells expressing p42 or p46 with EMCV and then stained for OAS1 and doublestranded RNA (dsRNA) followed by cLSM. In mock infected cells expressing p46, this isoform
was localized to perinuclear structures (Figure 4A). In cells infected with EMCV, p46 was no
longer perinuclear and instead redistributed throughout the cell to sites of double-stranded viral
RNA replication intermediate accumulation (Figure 4A). In contrast, p42 remained in the cytosol
and nucleus before and after infection (Figure 4A). These data suggest that p46 is in close
proximity to sites of EMCV RNA replication where double stranded RNA ligands are present.
We next used an RNA immunoprecipitation approach to test whether OAS1 p46 has enhanced
access to EMCV RNA and if the CaaX motif is important for its ability to bind EMCV RNA.
Since RNase L cleaves RNA and is required for OAS1-mediated restriction of EMCV, RNase L
deficient Huh7 cells allowed us to test OAS1 isoform binding to EMCV RNA in samples with
equivalent amounts of EMCV RNA (Figure 4B). N-terminally FLAG-tagged OAS1 p42, p46,
p42CTIL and p46ATIL isoforms were expressed in OAS1 KO Huh7 cells, which are also devoid
of RNase L expression (Figure S4A). Expression of OAS1 isoforms in OAS1 KO Huh7 cells had
no impact on viral RNA levels (Figure 4B). However, RT-qPCR for EMCV RNA after FLAG
immunoprecipitation revealed that p46 tended to bind more EMCV RNA than p42 (Figure 4B).
Although adding a CaaX motif to p42 (p42CTIL) did not significantly increase the ability of p42
to pull down EMCV RNA, mutating the CaaX motif on p46 (p46ATIL) caused a significant loss
in EMCV RNA binding (Figure 4B). These data confirm that endomembrane targeting through
the CaaX motif is required for p46 to bind EMCV RNA, as mutating the CaaX motif completely
ablated the ability of p46 to access EMCV RNA (Figure 4B).
To investigate the role of the CaaX motif to the antiviral activity of OAS1, we expressed
p42, p46, p42CTIL, or p46ATIL in OAS1 KO 293T cells followed by infection with EMCV
(Figure 4C). Compared to cells expressing p46, cells expressing CaaX-mutant p46ATIL showed
a significant five-fold increase in EMCV RNA as well as an increase in viral titer (Figures 4D
and 4E); a decreased antiviral activity similar to that of the p42 isoform. Intriguingly, addition of
a CaaX motif to OAS1 p42 did not increase the antiviral activity of p42 (Figures 4D and 4E).
One possible explanation for this discrepancy could be that the peptide sequence in the unique Cterminus of p42 contains a motif that is inhibitory to its antiviral activity. We therefore generated
another OAS1 variant which contains a CaaX motif directly downstream of the common OAS1
peptide sequence shared between all OAS1 isoforms, hereinafter referred to as OAS1

common+CTIL (Figure 4F). We tested the antiviral activity of OAS1 common+CTIL compared
to the p42 and p46 isoforms. At similar protein expression levels, OAS1 common+CTIL did not
confer significantly increased antiviral activity over the empty vector control and showed RNA
levels similar to those in cells expressing the p42 isoform (Figures 4G and 4H) Interestingly, the
OAS1 common+CTIL variant showed significantly decreased co-localization with Golgi
membranes compared to p46 and appeared cytosolic and nuclear, as observed above for CaaXdeficient p42 (Figure S4B). Together, these data indicate membrane targeting of OAS1 p46
through a CaaX motif is crucial for its antiviral activity against EMCV. However, a CaaX motif
alone is not sufficient to provide optimal antiviral activity against EMCV. Overall, these data
suggest other features in the unique C-termini of OAS1 p42 and p46 contribute to their
individual antiviral activity.

Combined effects of CaaX motif, C-terminus length and oligomerization domain confer
differential antiviral activity of OAS1 isoforms.
Since the unique C-terminus of p46 (50 aa) is longer than the unique C-terminus of p42
(18 aa), we investigated if the unique sequence in p46 contains additional motifs important for its
antiviral activity. We generated sequential hexameric alanine substitution mutants throughout the
C-terminus of OAS1 p46 and compared their antiviral activity against EMCV alongside p46 and
CaaX-deficient p46ATIL (Figure 5A). As expected from our previous experiments, p46ATIL
had reduced antiviral activity when compared with p46 (Figures 5B, 5C, and S5A). However,
compared to p46, none of the alanine substitution mutants affected viral RNA levels significantly
(Figures 5C and S5A). Notably, mutant 8 showed a trend toward increased EMCV RNA levels,
suggesting that the mutated amino acids might contribute to the antiviral activity of OAS1 p46.
Although OAS1 p46 mutant 8 localized to the Golgi, compared with p46, this mutant showed a
slight but significant decrease in its co-localization with golgin-97 (Figures S5B and S5C). In
fact, the E392-E/N393-D/N394 sequence is conserved in most mammalian OAS1 p46 orthologous
isoforms, which suggests a possible function for this motif (Figure S1B). Nevertheless, none of
the alanine substitution mutants affected EMCV RNA levels as strongly as the disruption of the
CaaX motif in p46ATIL.
Previous studies have demonstrated a three amino acid motif (C331F332K333), present in all
OAS1 isoforms, is critical for OAS1 oligomerization and 2′-5′A production(Ghosh et al., 1997).
The CFK motif is in close proximity to the unique C-termini of p42 and p46, however, the
requirement of the CFK domain for the antiviral activity of these proteins is unknown. Therefore,
we generated OAS1 p42 and p46 CFK mutants (C331A-F332A-K333A) and compared their
antiviral activity against EMCV to their wild type counterparts. Relative to wild type p42 and
p46, mutation of the CFK domain led to a significant loss in the ability of p42 and p46 to reduce
EMCV RNA by three-fold and two-fold, respectively (Figures 5D and 5E). Interestingly,
disruption of the CFK motif in p42 resulted in complete loss of antiviral activity, demonstrated
by similar EMCV RNA copies as cells expressing an empty vector control (Figures 5D and 5E).
OAS1 p46 with a disrupted CFK motif maintained residual antiviral activity similar to the

antiviral activity of wild type p42 (Figures 5D and 5E). These data show that the antiviral
activity of OAS1 p42 and p46 is partially mediated by CFK motif-dependent oligomerization.
This oligomerization facilitates enhanced 2′-5′A synthesis capacity (Figure S5D). Furthermore,
we show that CFK-mediated oligomerization is required for optimal EMCV RNA binding of
OAS1 p46 (Figure S5E). Importantly, mutation of the CFK motif did not alter the localization of
either isoform (Figures S5F and S5G). This suggests that the antiviral activity of OAS1 p42 is
completely dependent on the CFK oligomerization motif, whereas p46 only partially depends on
the CFK oligomerization motif for its antiviral activity.
Since p46 is prenylated and embedded in cellular membranes, the longer C-terminus of
p46 may function as a flexible linker to facilitate optimal oligomerization. This may explain why
adding a CaaX motif to p42 is not sufficient to enhance its antiviral activity (see Figures 4C-E).
To test this, we generated several C-terminal truncation mutants of p46 termed p46 D12aa,
D22aa, and D32aa, and determined their antiviral activity against EMCV alongside p46 and
p42CTIL (Figure 5F). Compared to p46, the truncation mutants showed a length-dependent
decrease in their ability to reduce EMCV RNA (Figures 5G and 5H). The D22aa and D32aa
deletion mutants had similar antiviral activities as p42CTIL, which is identical in length to the
D32aa mutant (Figure 5H). Similar to p46, all the p46 truncation mutants localized to the Golgi
(Figure S5H). However, there was a slight but significant decrease in the correlation of p46
D32aa with the Golgi (Figure S5I). These data suggest that, in addition to the CaaX motif and an
oligomerization domain, the C-terminal length of p46 is important for its antiviral activity.
Furthermore, we observed the conservation of a longer CaaX-containing p46-specific Cterminal sequence without sequence similarity in various other species. Interestingly, the p46specific C-terminal sequence was truncated in rodents and bats. To test if the length of the p46specific C-terminal sequence affected the antiviral activity against EMCV, we created chimeric
proteins by inserting the C-terminal sequences specific to the p46 orthologs of cow (Bos taurus),
fox (Vulpes vulpes), flying fox (Pteropus alecto), and alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) into
the human OAS1 p46 gene (Figure S5J). We selected species with divergent OAS1 p46-specific
C-terminal sequences and minimal amino acid sequence identities when compared to human
OAS1 p46. We found cow and fox OAS1 chimeras mimicked human OAS1 p46 antiviral
activity, whereas the shorter C-terminus of flying fox led to decreased antiviral activity of the
chimeric protein compared to human OAS1 p46 (Figure S5J). These data are consistent with our
hypothesis that the length of the p46-specific C-terminal sequence is important for increased
antiviral activity. Intriguingly, the alligator OAS1 p46 chimeric protein, with similar C-terminus
length as human p46 but with most divergence in peptide sequence, failed to exhibit similar
antiviral activity as human OAS1 p46 (Figure S5J). Upon close examination, we found that the
alligator (and guinea pig) lack conservation of the E392-E/N393-D/N394 motif proximal to the
CaaX motif, which we have shown is required for strong antiviral activity (Figures 5A-C and
S1B). These data suggest that the length of the p46-specific C-terminal sequence, CFK
oligomerization domain, and potentially E-E/N-D/N sequence are required for enhanced antiviral
activity of OAS1 p46.

OAS1 p46 has broad antiviral activity against viruses that use the endomembrane system
for replication.
We sought to define the antiviral activity of OAS1 isoforms against other positive-strand
RNA viruses that use the endomembrane system for replication. We tested if OAS1 isoforms are
differentially antiviral against West Nile virus (WNV) by infecting OAS1 KO 293T cells
expressing p42, p46, or control with WNV. WNV, like all flaviviruses, replicates on membranes
of the endomembrane system, primarily ER-derived membranes (Westaway et al., 1997).
Expression of p46 led to a 90% reduction in WNV titer relative to control, while p42 did not
significantly impact WNV titer (Figure 6A). These data demonstrate that OAS1 p46 has
enhanced antiviral activity against WNV.
We tested if the enhanced antiviral activity of p46 against WNV could be explained by
p46 localizing to sites of flavivirus RNA replication. We performed cLSM to evaluate the
localization of p42 and p46 during flavivirus infection. We infected OAS1 KO 293T cells
expressing p42 and p46 with WNV, followed by staining for OAS1, dsRNA, and the
endoplasmic reticulum protein disulfide-isomerase A3 (PDIA3), since WNV replicates within
invaginations of the ER membrane. During WNV infection, we observed p42 in the cytosol and
nucleus. Indeed, p42 did not appear to be recruited to sites of WNV RNA production (Figure 6B,
top panel, arrows). However, during WNV infection, p46 localized to PDIA3 and dsRNApositive replication sites (Figure 6B, bottom panel, arrows). Quantification of OAS1 isoforms
relative to PDIA3 revealed a significant increase in the correlation of p46, but not p42, to
PDIA3-positive membranes during infection, suggesting that p46 is recruited to sites of WNV
replication (Figures 6B and 6C). Quantification of OAS1 isoform localization to viral RNA
revealed OAS1 p46 has significantly stronger localization to dsRNA during WNV infection than
p42 (Figure 6D).
We evaluated whether p46 was present in the Golgi during WNV infection by staining
for OAS1, Golgin-97, and dsRNA in cells infected with WNV. OAS1 p46 was significantly
more correlated with the Golgi than p42 in both uninfected and WNV-infected cells (Figures
S6A and S6B). However, WNV infection caused a significant decrease in the association of p46
with Golgin-97 (Figures S6A and S6B). This suggests that p46 may be recruited from the Golgi
to sites of WNV replication and is consistent with previous observations that Golgi membranes
and proteins, including RNA binding proteins, are recruited to the replication organelles of
flaviviruses (Ward et al., 2016). Alternatively, p46 might be recruited during prenylation at the
ER membrane.
We next tested if p46 localizes to sites of Zika virus (ZIKV) replication, another
flavivirus that utilizes ER membranes for replication(Cortese et al., 2017). We observed p46, but
not p42, localized to ZIKV replication sites at the ER (Figure S6C). Overall, these data suggest
that endomembrane localization of OAS1 p46 allows this protein to access sites of flavivirus
RNA replication.
The human pathogenic picornavirus coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) replicates within
modified Golgi membranes, and thus p46 may also be positioned to readily sense CVB3 RNA

(Melia et al., 2019). We tested the antiviral activity of OAS1 p42 and p46 against CVB3 by
infecting OAS1 KO 293T cells expressing p42, p46 or a control. RT-qPCR analysis at 24h postinfection revealed a 70% reduction in CVB3 RNA in p46 expressing cells compared to control,
while p42 had almost no effect on CVB3 RNA levels (Figure S6D). Similarly, CVB3 titers at
48h post-infection were significantly reduced by 50% in p46 expressing cells (Figure 6E). These
data suggest that OAS1 p46 may have broad antiviral activity against members of the
picornavirus family, while p42 is less effective.
Coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, use the endomembrane system for replication
using primarily ER-derived membranes (Romero-Brey and Bartenschlager, 2014; Snijder et al.,
2020). We therefore hypothesized that p46 may have enhanced antiviral activity against
coronaviruses. We assessed the antiviral activity of p42 and p46 against SARS-CoV-2 in 293T
cells expressing the receptor ACE2. Expression of p42 led to a five-fold reduction in SARSCoV-2 titer (Figure 6F). However, p46 had a significant five-fold greater antiviral activity over
p42 (25-fold over EV) against SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 6F). Importantly, the enhanced antiviral
activity of p46 against SARS-CoV-2 depended on the CaaX motif, as p46ATIL demonstrated
decreased antiviral activity similar to that of p42. This suggests that endomembrane targeting of
p46 is critical to its enhanced antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 6F).
We next tested the antiviral activity of p42 and p46 against negative- strand RNA viruses,
such as Influenza A virus (IAV) and Indiana vesiculovirus (formerly VSV), which do not
replicate on intracellular organelle membranes. IAV replicates within the nucleus where p42 is
also present and is sensitive to the OAS/RNase L pathway (Li et al., 2016; Min and Krug, 2006).
To test if OAS1 isoforms are differentially antiviral against IAV, we infected OAS1 KO 293T
cells expressing p42, p46, or a control with influenza A/PR/8/34 (Figure S6E). Viral RNA
analysis revealed neither OAS1 isoform impacted IAV RNA levels significantly at 24h postinfection. Mutations in IAV NS1 disrupting RNA binding render this virus sensitive to the
OAS/RNase L pathway, although it is unclear if what antiviral role OAS1 and isoforms playing
during IAV infection (Min and Krug, 2006). We found expression of p42 or p46 had no impact
on the replication of this NS1-mutant IAV (Figure S6F). Similarly, we observed that GFPexpressing VSV, which replicates in the cytosol, was also insensitive to OAS1 p42 and p46.
Compared to an empty vector control, expression of p42 or p46 did not impact the number of
GFP+ cells during infection (Figure S6G). Collectively these data suggest OAS1 p46 is broadly
antiviral against viruses that use the endomembrane system for replication.
OAS1 rs10774671 is associated with severe COVID-19 disease.
Since the OAS1 rs10774671 A/G variant generates the OAS1 p42 and p46 isoforms,
respectively, that affected the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we tested whether this SNP is
associated with COVID-19 disease severity. We hypothesized that the G allele, that encodes the
p46 isoform would decrease the risk of severe COVID-19 complications due to its superior
antiviral activity compared to the A allele that generates p42. To test this, we genotyped the
rs10774671 SNP in 34 COVID-19 severe cases (hospitalized, requiring mechanical ventilation)

and 99 ancestry matched healthy controls (Table S1). Association was tested by logistic
regression, adjusting for sex and self-reported ancestry. We detected association of rs10774671
in severe COVID-19 cases (p=0.017, Odds Ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.15-0.83) using a dominant
model, indicating that the G allele was protective for severe COVID-19 disease.
These data are consistent with results from a recent genome wide association study of
1,676 critically ill COVID-19 patients of European descent and UK Biobank controls (n=8,380)
which identified a significant association with the OAS1/OAS2/OAS3 locus (Pairo-Castineira et
al., 2020b). The lead SNP in this region, rs10735079 (p=1.65x10-8, OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.18-1.42),
is in high linkage disequilibrium with the rs10774671 A/G splicing site variant (D’0.91, r2=0.79).
To replicate our findings, we tested association of rs10774671 in these cohorts by logistic
regression, correcting for age, sex, postal code deprivation decile, and principal components of
ancestry. Significant association of the rs10774671 G allele with severe COVID-19 was detected
(p=7.38x10-7, OR 0.80 95% CI 0.71-0.89). Together these results demonstrate that the G allele at
OAS1 rs10774671 encoding the OAS1 p46 isoform contributes protection from severe disease in
SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we show endomembrane targeting of OAS1 p46 confers enhanced antiviral
activity of this isoform against viruses that use the endomembrane system for their replication.
The p46 isoform contains a functional CaaX motif that targets this isoform to the endomembrane
system, primarily to Golgi membranes, while other OAS1 isoforms localize to the cytosol and
nucleus. Compared with p42, the p46 isoform has enhanced antiviral activity against
picornaviruses, flaviviruses, and SARS-CoV-2, all viruses that replicate their RNA within
modified organelles of the endomembrane system (Cortese et al., 2017; Melia et al., 2019; Melia
et al., 2018; Snijder et al., 2020). Although replicating in these modified endomembrane
compartments is an important immune evasion strategy of positive-strand RNA viruses, out data
shows localizing OAS1 p46 to the endomembrane system results in enhanced access to viral
RNA and activation of RNase L dependent antiviral activity. In contrast, p42, which is localized
to the cytosol and nucleus, has a comparatively weak ability to sense viral RNA and initiate
antiviral activity against viruses that replicate within intracellular membranes (Figure 7).
Placement of innate immune sensors at intracellular membranes is an antiviral strategy
likely difficult for positive-strand RNA viruses to evade, as these viruses are unlikely to evolve
away from this fundamental replication strategy (Romero-Brey and Bartenschlager, 2014).
Secondly, many positive-strand RNA viruses depend on lipid products of the mevalonate
pathway or prenylation for replication and therefore cannot broadly antagonize this pathway
(Mackenzie et al., 2007). Viral antagonism by specifically targeting OAS1 p46 protein or
directly blocking its prenylation or splicing could be possible. Alternatively, viral interference of
the OAS-RNase L pathway would negate the antiviral activity OAS1 p46. Such a mechanism is

We also show addition of the CaaX motif to p42 is not sufficient to enhance its ability to
bind viral RNA or increase its antiviral activity. This suggests the CaaX motif is just one of the
crucial features in the unique OAS1 p46 C-terminal region that contributes to differential
antiviral activity. Tetramerization of OAS1 has been proposed as a requirement for synthesis of
the second messenger 2′-5′A, indicating that several OAS1 molecules in close proximity are
required to induce 2′-5′A synthesis upon viral RNA binding and to subsequently activate the
RNase L pathway (Ghosh et al., 1997). Aggregation of several OAS1 proteins around viral
dsRNA might also increase the number of RNA-binding domains within the OAS1/vRNA
complex, thereby allowing access to longer vRNA increasing 2′-5′A synthesis. Mutation of the
CFK oligomerization motif in OAS1 p42 led to a complete loss of antiviral activity, while the
p46 CFK mutant maintained antiviral activity similar to that of the wildtype p42 isoform. This
suggests a model in which OAS1 p46 without a functional CFK oligomerization domain still
maintains a residual antiviral activity. These data show p46 proteins might oligomerize which is
further aided by CaaX motif-mediated localization at Golgi membranes. Together, we have
defined features including the CaaX motif in the unique C-terminus that contribute to the
enhanced antiviral activity of p46. The unique alternatively spliced C-terminal region including
the oligomerization and prenylation motifs in p46 is maintained across vertebrates presumably
because it displays the strongest antiviral activity compared to other OAS1 isoforms (Figure 7).
The rs10774671 G allele controlling OAS1 p46 expression was originally identified as a
West Nile virus resistance allele, although the mechanism accounting for the protection
conferred by this SNP was lacking (Lim et al., 2009). In this study, we identify a functional
OAS1 splice site variant affects COVID-19 outcome. We found the A allele contributes to
genetic risk for severe COVID-19 disease in patients with respiratory failure compared to
healthy control subjects in two cohorts. We propose the G allele association with protection
against severe COVID-19 is explained in part by the enhanced antiviral activity of OAS1 p46
against SARS-CoV-2, which contributes to early control of viral replication. Additionally, both
rs10774671 and the lead GWAS SNP rs10735079 are expression and splicing QTL for OAS1
and OAS3 in our analyses (Pairo-Castineira et al., 2020a). Thus, the association of these SNPs
with severe COVID-19 may be two-fold: affecting splicing and expression levels both of those
observed in primary human cells.
We have shown that the splice-site SNP controls the subcellular targeting of a critical
viral RNA sensor, OAS1, which may allow the host to respond to viral evolutionary pressures
and replication strategies. Interestingly, the G allele is ancestral and prevalent in African
populations, in contrast the A allele is prevalent in rest of the world. Previous studies have
documented reintroduction of the G-allele into Homo sapiens population by introgression from
Neanderthals (Sams et al., 2016) and this could have implications for COVID-19 disease. Other
innate immune genes upstream of OAS1 that are associated with severe COVID-19 in a genome

wide association study are IFNAR2, and TYK2, which are in the type I IFN pathway (PairoCastineira et al., 2020a). Perturbations in any of these genes could affect OAS1 expression and
its effector activity. Genetic studies, SARS-CoV-2 antagonism of IFN transcription, and
autoantibodies against IFNa/b strongly associate with severe COVID-19, indicating that the type
I IFN pathway might be compromised in patients with severe COVID-19 (Bastard et al., 2021;
de Prost et al., 2021; Pairo-Castineira et al.; Xia et al., 2020). While it would be interesting to
study the individual and combined effects of the above genes on OAS1 and COVID-19 disease,
our study suggests there are strong selective pressures, presumably viral, impacting the
prevalence of OAS1 causal splice site-SNP in in human populations. (Li et al., 2017; Liu et al.,
2017; O'Brien et al., 2010).
The broad number of RNA- and even DNA-viruses inhibited by the OAS/RNAse L
pathway has raised interesting questions about the determinates of OAS antiviral specificity
(Silverman, 2007). In humans, the OAS family is comprised of three catalytically active OAS
proteins: OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3. OAS1 contains an RNA binding domain and a catalytically
active domain, while OAS2 contains a catalytically inactive repeat of this unit, and OAS3
contains two catalytically inactive repeats of this unit (Hornung et al., 2014). The effect of OAS3
SNPs that associate with COVID-19 is still unclear (Pairo-Castineira et al., 2020a). Although the
OAS proteins have different RNA binding capabilities and favor synthesis of different lengths of
2′-5′A(Ibsen et al., 2014), we demonstrate a novel mechanism where subcellular localization
determines the antiviral specificity of these proteins. The broad number of RNA- and even DNAviruses inhibited by the OAS/RNAse L pathway has raised interesting questions about the
determinates of OAS antiviral specificity (Silverman, 2007). In humans, the OAS family is
comprised of three catalytically active OAS proteins: OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3. OAS1 contains
an RNA binding domain and a catalytically active domain, while OAS2 contains a catalytically
inactive repeat of this unit, and OAS3 contains two catalytically inactive repeats of this unit
(Hornung et al., 2014). Although the OAS proteins have different RNA binding capabilities and
favor synthesis of different lengths of 2′-5′A (Ibsen et al., 2014), we demonstrate a novel
mechanism where subcellular localization determines the antiviral specificity of these proteins
(Ibsen et al., 2014). Based on the reduction of vRNA in our study, we propose a model in which
2′-5′A locally activates RNase L around sites of viral replication. While the function of OAS1
p42 is unclear but might confer resistance to yet unknown pathogen. This is further supported by
the genetic association of the A allele with multiple autoimmune disorders, as enhanced immune
responses are sometimes made at a tradeoff for overall host fitness (Li et al., 2017; Liu et al.,
2017; O'Brien et al., 2010).
Our work highlights intracellular targeting as a crucial determinant for the specificity of
OAS1. By positioning viral RNA sensors at different subcellular sites of viral RNA
accumulation, the host can potentially respond to diverse replication strategies in the cytosol,
nucleus, or on intracellular membranes. Although this work focused on OAS1 and the detection

of viral nucleic acids, subcellular targeting is likely also important for function of other OAS
proteins. Future studies on the subcellular localization of other OAS proteins will define how this
pathway is able to respond to viruses with diverse intracellular replication strategies.

Figure 7. Schematic depicting how endomembrane targeting of OAS1 p46 primes antiviral
activity against positive-strand RNA viruses. A splice-acceptor SNP (rs10774671) controls
production of the p42/p46 OAS1 isoforms. Isoform-specific prenylation localizes p46 to the
Golgi apparatus, while OAS1 p42 is cytosolic. During positive-strand RNA virus infection,
OAS1 p46 is recruited to virus replication organelles (VROs) of flaviviruses, picornaviruses and
coronaviruses. Through this targeting p46 gains enhanced access to viral RNA. OAS1 p42
remains cytosolic and nuclear during infection and has limited access to viral RNA. Both OAS1
isoforms require catalytic activity and RNase L to be antiviral.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells, cell culture conditions and treatments
All cells (Table S2) were incubated at 37° C with 5% CO2. HEK293T, A549, Vero, PH5CH8,
Huh7, and HeLa cells were grown in DMEM (Sigma) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS) (Atlanta Biologicals) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine
(Mediatech). Daudi cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) containing 10% heat-inactivated
FBS (Atlanta Biologicals) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (Mediatech). THP-1 cells
were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Atlanta
Biologicals), 1% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (Mediatech), 10 mM Hepes (Corning), 1x
NEAA (Corning), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Corning), and 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma).
Where applicable, THP-1 cells were differentiated in THP-1 media containing 40 nM of PMA
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 24h. Recombinant human rIFNβ (PBL Interferon Source) was used at 2001000 IU/mL.
Generation of knockout cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing
Cloning of OAS1 targeting guide RNA (gRNA) 5′-GTGCATGCGGAAACACGTGTCTGG-3′
into pRRLU6-empty-gRNA-MND-Cas9-t2A-Puro vector or RNase L targeting gRNA 5′GTTATCCTCGCAGCGATTGCGGGG-3′ into pRRLU6-empty-gRNA-MND-Cas9-t2A-Blast
was achieved using the In-Fusion enzyme mix (Clontech). OAS1 and RNASEL KO 293T were
generated using lentiviral transduction as described previously followed by selection in 2 μg/mL
puromycin or blasticidin (Lau et al., 2015). Transient transfection was utilized to knockout OAS1
in A549 and Huh7 cells. Cells were transfected with OAS1 gRNA or a Cas9-expressing control
vector using TransIT-X2 (Mirus Bio) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. At 24h post
transfection, cells were selected with 2 μg/mL puromycin. Knockouts were validated by western
blotting.
Generation of 293T-ACE2 cells
Lentiviral expression vector for ACE2 (pLEX-ACE2) was generated by amplifying the ACE2
sequence from cDNA from Huh7 cells (5′27

GACTCTACTAGAGGATCCGCCACCATGTCAAGCTCTTCCTGGCTCC-3′ and 5′GGGCCCTCTAGACTCGAGCTAAAAGGAGGTCTGAACATCATCAGTG-3′. This amplicon
was cloned into a pLEX lentiviral backbone cut with BamHI and XhoI using the InFusion HD kit
(Takara). pLEX-ACE2 was co-transfected with psPAX2 and pMD2.G into 293FT cells for
lentiviral packaging. 293T cells were transduced with ACE2-expressing lentivirus and selected
with puromycin (2 mg/mL) for 4 days to generate 293T-ACE2 cells. ACE2 expression was
verified by immunoblot (Proteintech).
Immunoblotting
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (+1× HALT protease and phosphatase inhibitor), and 10-30 μg
total protein from whole-cell lysates was run on SDS–PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Thermo Scientific). The membranes were blocked in 5% milk in PBS-T
(pPBS/Tween 20). Primary antibody (Table S3) incubation with antibodies against OAS1 (CST),
RNase L (CST), or FLAG (Sigma) were performed in 5% milk in PBS-T overnight at 4°C.
Membranes were washed for 5 minutes in PBS-T three times. Secondary antibody incubation
was performed in 5% milk in PBS-T at room temperature for one hour and after membranes
were washed for 5 minutes in PBS-T three times. Membranes were imaged on a Chemidoc XR
system.
OAS1 siRNA knockdown
Dicer-substrate short interfering RNAs against a common region of OAS1 or the unique 3′UTR
of p42 or p46 were custom designed and procured from Integrated DNA Technologies (Table
S1). THP-1 cells were differentiated with PMA for 24h. At 24h post treatment, cells were
transfected with 20 nM of siRNA using TransIT-X2 (Mirus Bio) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Viral infections were performed at 24h post-transfection.

Cloning
Expression plasmids encoding OAS1 p42, p42CTIL, p44, p46, p46ATIL, p48 and p52 were
generated by Gibson assembly of the common OAS1 sequence with the isoform-specific
sequence into the pCDNA3.1 vector (Table S4). Empty pcDNA3.1 was cut using BamHI and
XbaI. A Gibson assembly compatible fragment for the common sequence of OAS1 was PCRamplified from an OAS1 expression plasmid (gift from Dan Stetson) using primers 5′TGGTACCGAGCTCGATGATGGATCTCAGAA-3′ and 5′-CAGCAGAATCCAGG
AGCTCACTGG-3′. Gibson assembly compatible fragments for the unique sequences of p42,
p42CTIL, and p44 were generated by PCR amplification of annealed sense and antisense oligos
(Table S1). Gibson assembly compatible sequences for the unique portions for p46, p46ATIL,
and p48, were generated by PCR amplification of gBlocks. N-terminal FLAG-tagged versions of
OAS1 p42 and p46 were generated by cutting pcDNA3.1 OAS1 p42, p42CTIL, p46 and
p46ATIL with BamHI and cloning of a 3xFLAG fragment by PCR amplification from pEF
FLAG-ZAP-L (Schwerk et al., 2019) and Gibson assembly using primers 5′28

OAS1 KO 293T cells were seeded in 12 well plates coated with 10 μg/mL poly-L-ornithine
hydrobromide (Sigma) and allowed to adhere overnight. Plasmids were then transfected using
TransIT-X2 (Mirus Bio). At 24h post transfection, cells were infected with EMCV, WNV, or
CVB at the indicated MOIs for 1h with gentle rocking. After 1h the inoculum was removed, and
fresh media was added. For virus titer quantification, culture supernatants were serially diluted in
DMEM using 96 well plates. For EMCV and WNV, titration was performed on Vero cells grown
to 90% confluency in 6-well plates. For CVB, titration was performed on HeLa cells grown to
90% confluency in 6-well plates. IAV was titered on MDCK cells grown to 90% confluency in
12-well plates. The inoculum was removed after 1h of gentle rocking and a 0.8% agarose overlay
was added containing the following: 0.8% UltraPure Low Melting Point Agarose (Thermo
Fisher), 1x DMEM, 0.15% Sodium Bicarbonate, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS)
(Atlanta Biologicals) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (Mediatech). For EMCV plates
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 24h post-infection
followed by staining with a 5% crystal violet solution prepared by dissolving crystal violet
(Sigma Aldrich) in a 50/50 mixture of 100% ethanol and deionized water. For IAV plates were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 24h post-infection followed by
staining with a 5% crystal violet solution. For CVB plates were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde

later.
For quantification of Indiana vesiculovirus (VSV-GFP) replication, OAS1 KO 293T cells
transfected with OAS1 p42, p46 and EV for 24h prior to infection, were infected with Indiana
vesiculovirus (VSV-GFP; MOI=0.5, 6h). Cells were harvested using trypsin, washed 2x with
PBS, and incubated with Zombie NIR fixable viability dye (1:1000) (BioLegend) for 30 min at
room temperature in PBS. Cells were washed 2x with PBS, fixed in 4% PFA for 10 minutes at
room temperature, and then washed once with FACS buffer (PBS with 0.1%BSA). Flow
cytometry was performed on a BD FACS Canto II. % VSV-GFP+ cells were quantified using
FlowJo (Tree Star).
SARS-CoV-2 strain USA/WA-1/2020 was propagated and titered on VeroE6 cells (gift
of Dr. Ralph Baric). For infections, 293T-ACE2 cells seeded in 24-well plates (100,000
cells/well) were transfected with 250ng of plasmid (Empty vector, p42, p46, and p46 ATIL)
using the TransIT X2 kit (Mirus). A duplicate plate was transfected at the same time in order to
confirm OAS1 expression by immunoblot. 24 hours post-transfection, cells were infected with

using a Nikon Eclipse Ti laser scanning confocal microscope using a 60x oil-immersion lens.
Images were processed and analyzed using the NIS elements software and Fiji. Quantification of
co-localization was performed using the Fiji Coloc 2 plugin.
RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and RT-qPCR
Total RNA was isolated using the NucleoSpin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg total RNA using the QuantiTect RT
kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-qPCR was carried out using the
ViiA7 RT-qPCR system with TaqMan reagents using TaqMan primers/probes (Life
Technologies) for EMCV 5′UTR (Table S1).
RNA immunoprecipitation
OAS1 KO Huh7 cells were seeded the day before transfection with FLAG-p42, FLAG-p42CTIL,
FLAG-p46, FLAG-p46ATIL or an EV control using TransIT-X2 (Mirus Bio). At 24h post
transfection, cells were infected with EMCV at an MOI of 0.001. At 12h post-infection, cells
were harvested and lysed in RNA-IP lysis buffer (100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES
pH 7.4, 0.5% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 1× HALT protease inhibitor, 100 U/mL RNasin and 2 mM
ribonucleoside-vanadyl complex). Nuclei and debris were removed from the cytosolic lysate by
centrifugation at 8,000 g at 4 °C for 10 min. Next, 400 μg protein from the cytosolic lysate was
incubated with 5 μg anti-FLAG mouse IgG1 (M2, Sigma) or mouse IgG1 control overnight at 4
°C, with rotation. The next day, 0.75 mg Dynabeads Protein G (Invitrogen) was added, and the
lysate was incubated for 2h at 4 °C with rotation. After washing, coprecipitated RNA was
isolated from IgG1-protein complexes by chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction, reverse
transcribed into cDNA (QuantiTect RT kit, Qiagen) and analyzed by RT-qPCR.
OAS1 in vitro activity assay
Enrichment of FLAG-tagged OAS1 isoform proteins prior to in vitro activity assay was
performed as described for the RNA-IP above. Briefly, OAS1 KO 293T cells were seeded on a
10 cm dish and transfected with FLAG-tagged OAS1 isoform expression plasmids and harvested
24h post transfection in Co-IP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Igepal
Ca-630, 1 mM EDTA, 1x HALT protease inhibitor). Lysate was incubated with 10 μg anti32

FLAG mouse IgG1 (M2, Sigma) at 4 °C, with rotation. The next day, 1.5 mg Dynabeads Protein
G (Invitrogen) was added, and the lysate was incubated for 2h at 4 °C with rotation, and then
washed 6x with Co-IP lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated protein samples were incubated in
reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 25 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/mL
BSA) supplemented with 400 mM ATP, ~80 nM [a-32P]-labelled ATP (3000 Ci/mmol 10
mCi/mL, 250 µCi; PerkinElmer), and 33.3 µg/mL poly(I:C) (Invivogen). The reactions were
allowed to proceed for 2 hours at 37 °C. The reactions were then analyzed by denaturing gel
electrophoresis on a 20 cm tall 20% polyacrylamide 7 M urea gel with 0.5 x TBE running buffer
at 12.5 W. The gels were then applied onto Whatman filter paper, covered with plastic, and
exposed directly to a PhosphorImager screen (GE Healthcare) for 15 to 40 minutes, as necessary.
[32P]-labeled 2′-5′ oligoadenylate products were visualized using a Sapphire Biomolecular
Imager (Azure Biosystems).
Genetic association
Samples from a cohort of 34 severe COVID-19 cases were collected starting in April 2020 at
Virginia Mason Medical Center and Benaroya Research Institute. Severity was based on
hospitalization in the critical care unit with mechanical ventilation. A cohort of 99 healthy
control subjects matched for ancestry (self-reported) was assembled from participants in the
healthy control registry at Benaroya Research Institute. Both studies were approved by the
Institutional Review Board at Benaroya Research Institute (IRB20-036 and IRB07109
respectively). A description of the cohorts is presented in Table S3. DNA samples from these
subjects were genotyped for OAS1 rs10774671 using a Taqman SNP genotyping assay (Thermo
Fisher). Genotypes passed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium analysis. Association testing was
performed using gPLINK v2.050 by logistic regression adjusting for sex and ancestry
(race/ethnicity). Replication of genetic association was tested using 1,676 critically ill COVID19 cases collected through the GenOMICC study in the UK and 8,380 population based controls
(1:5 cases:controls) from the UK Biobank samples as described (Pairo-Castineira et al., 2020a).
All subjects were of European descent as determined by ancestry informative markers. DNA was
genotyped using the Illumina Global Screening Array v3.0+ multi disease bead chips (Illumina)
and subjected to standard quality control filters. Tests for association between cases and controls
were performed by logistic regression using PLINK, with sex, age (as of April 1, 2020),
deprivation score of residential postal code, and the first 10 principal components as covariates.
Statistics
Statistical analyses (other than genetic analysis) were performed with Prism 8 and the specific
statistical analyses performed are indicated in the figure legends.
