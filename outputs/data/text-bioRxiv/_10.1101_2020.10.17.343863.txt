Abstract
In the current global emergency due to SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, passive immunotherapy
emerges as a promising treatment for COVID-19. Among animal-derived products, equine
formulations are still the cornerstone therapy for treating envenomations due to animal bites
and stings. Therefore, drawing upon decades of experience in manufacturing snake
antivenom, we developed and preclinically evaluated two anti-SARS-CoV-2 polyclonal
equine formulations as potential alternative therapy for COVID-19. We immunized two
groups of horses with either S1 (anti-S1) or a mixture of S1, N, and SEM mosaic (anti-Mix)
viral recombinant proteins. Horses reached a maximum anti-viral antibody level at 7 weeks
following priming, and showed no major adverse acute or chronic clinical alterations. Two
whole-IgG formulations were prepared via hyperimmune plasma precipitation with caprylic
acid and then formulated for parenteral use. Both preparations had similar physicochemical
and microbiological quality and showed ELISA immunoreactivity towards S1 protein and
the receptor binding domain (RBD). The anti-Mix formulation also presented
immunoreactivity against N protein. Due to high anti-S1 and anti-RBD antibody content,
final products exhibited high in vitro neutralizing capacity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 80
times higher than a pool of human convalescent plasma. Pre-clinical quality profiles were
similar among both products, but clinical efficacy and safety must be tested in clinical trials.
The technological strategy we describe here can be adapted by other producers, particularly
in low- and middle-income countries.

1. Introduction
COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) is a recent pandemic disease caused by the newly
emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1. It has generated
millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths (https://covid19.who.int/), and has
become a serious threat to global public health and economies worldwide. General symptoms
of COVID-19 are fever, severe respiratory illness, dyspnea, and pneumonia, with additional
possible complications such as multiple-organ dysfunction or failure, that compromises the
gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal, and central nervous systems, and can lead to septic
shock2–4.
Like other coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is an enveloped single-stranded RNA
virus, with a virion composed of at least four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E),
membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N)5. Protein S is implicated in cellular recognition, fusion,
and entry5,6, making it the most attractive target for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic development.
Although contagion by this emerging virus continues to increase across the globe, more
time is needed to develop and validate vaccines, drugs, and therapies to counteract the
disease. Immunoglobulin-based therapies, such as treatment with human convalescent
plasma, formulations of immunoglobulins purified from plasma of convalescent patients or
hyperimmunized animals, or recombinant monoclonal antibodies, arise as a feasible option
that may be achievable on a shorter time scale 7–10. Treatment

of

COVID-19

with

convalescent plasma seems to be well-tolerated, reduces mortality, and has the potential to
improve clinical outcomes, based on several case series studies, matched-control studies, and
small randomized clinical trials11–15. However, these results must be confirmed by large and
ongoing controlled clinical trials.

Formulations of immunoglobulins purified from plasma of convalescent patients have
also been used to treat severe respiratory illnesses with viral etiology, but to a lesser
extent7,16,17. These formulations are advantageous over unpurified convalescent plasma
because they are safer and have higher activity, polyvalency, and product consistency7,9,18.
However, this strategy is donor-dependent, requires strict donor screening for both human
pathogens and high levels of neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and relies on wellestablished blood bank systems that may be scarce in developing countries8.
On the other hand, formulations of animal-derived immunoglobulins, such as anti-SARSCoV F(ab´)2-equine formulations, have shown neutralizing efficacy in cell culture and in in
vivo murine and hamsters models, as well as in both prophylactic and therapeutic
experimental settings19–23. Similarly, Zhao et al.24 demonstrated effective in vitro and in vivo
neutralization of MERS-CoV by IgG and F(ab’)2-formulations obtained from horses
immunized with MERS-CoV virus-like particles (VLPs) expressing MERS-CoV proteins.
More recently, two independent groups obtained F(ab’)2 preparations through immunization
of horses with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 RBD (receptor binding domain; located at S1
subunit), and demonstrated preclinical efficacy as a potential therapy for COVID-19 both in
vitro25,26 and in vivo in a murine model25. Also, a F(ab´)2 formulation with high in vitro
neutralizing potency was developed by immunizing horses with recombinant pre-fusion
trimers of SARS-CoV-2 S protein, comprising S1 and S2 subunits27.
In light of these favorable outcomes, and harnessing our experience in manufacturing
equine snake antivenom28, we developed two formulations of whole-IgG from plasma of
horses immunized with one of two types of SARS-CoV-2 recombinant proteins: S1 (anti-S1)
or a mixture of S1, SEM mosaic, and N proteins (anti-Mix). We detail the manufacturing
procedure, quality and safety profiles, and in vitro preclinical efficacy of the final

2.3 Production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune plasma
2.3.1

Hematology, plasma chemistry, and general clinical status of horses

We evaluated the health condition of horses before, during, and after immunization and
bleeding. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein in EDTA-coated vials and
electrolytes were measured using an electrolyte analyzer (9180, Roche; Indianapolis, USA).
The plasma chemical profile was assessed with a Cobas analyzer (C111, Roche), and
hematocrit and hemoglobin concentration values were obtained using a hematology system
for veterinary use (EOS, EXIGO; Spånga, Sweden).

2.3.2

Immunization of horses

Two groups of three Ibero-American and mixed breed horses, ranging from 3 to 15 years old
and 350 to 450 kg, were immunized with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. The first group (anti-S1)
was immunized with the S1 protein alone, while the second group (anti-Mix) was immunized
with a mixture of equal parts of S1, N, and Spike-E-M mosaic proteins (SEM). In brief,
horses were injected subcutaneously at two weeks intervals according to the scheme
summarized in Table 1. Freund’s complete adjuvant (F5881, Sigma-Aldrich; Missouri,
USA), Freund’s incomplete adjuvant (F5506-Sigma-Aldrich), and Emulsigen-D adjuvant
(MVP adjuvants; Nebraska, USA) were included to enhance the antibody response of horses.
Samples of serum were collected before and during immunization with each booster and
stored at -20 °C until use. Antibody responses of horses to SARS-CoV-2 proteins was
monitored via ELISA as described below.

2.3.3

Bleeding of horses and plasma separation

We bled horses 19 days after the last injection of viral proteins using a closed system of blood
collection bags. In total, three blood collections of 6 L each were performed across three
consecutive days. The first day, blood was collected and stored overnight at 2–8 °C to allow
erythrocyte sedimentation. The second day, plasma from the first day was separated from
erythrocytes, preserved by the addition of 0.005 % thimerosal, and stored at 2–8 °C until use.
Erythrocytes were suspended in saline solution and warmed to 37 °C. Then, following the
second collection of blood, tempered erythrocytes from the first day were transfused back to
the same animal. The third day, we repeated the same procedure as on the second day 31.

2.4 Purification and formulation of immunoglobulins
To prepare anti-S1 and anti-Mix formulations, we purified immunoglobulins using the
caprylic acid precipitation method32. Immunoglobulins were formulated at 65 g/L total
protein, 8.5 g/L NaCl, 2.0 g/L phenol and pH 7.0. Then, purified antibodies were sterilized
by 0.22 µm pore membrane filtration and dispensed in 10 mL glass vials.

2.5 Physicochemical analysis
2.5.1

Electrophoretic analysis

Electrophoretic analyses of viral proteins and equine formulations were performed in 4-20%
SDS-PAGE gel Mini-PROTEAN TGX (BioRad; California, USA) and 7.5% SDSpolyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE), respectively. All samples were analyzed under nonreducing conditions33, and compared with Thermo Scientific (26616; Massachusetts, USA)
pre-stained molecular mass markers. Protein bands were stained with Coomassie Brilliant
Blue R-250, and gels were destained with a mixture of methanol, ethanol, and acetic acid.

2.5.2

Total protein concentration

Total protein concentration was determined using a modification of the Biuret test 34. Fifty
microliters of protein standards were mixed with 2.5 mL of Biuret reagent and incubated at
room temperature for 30 min. We created a calibration curve with absorbances of the
standards at 540 nm. Then, we repeated the procedure with samples and calculated protein
concentration based on the equation of the calibration curve.

2.5.3

IgG monomer content

The content of IgG monomers was assessed by FPLC gel filtration chromatography in a
Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare, Pharmacia; Stockholm, Sweden), using
0.15 mol/L NaCl, 20 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.5 as the mobile phase with a 0.5 mL/min flow.
Protein peaks were detected by measuring absorbance at 280 nm.

2.5.4

Turbidity

Turbidity was quantified using a turbidimeter (220, La Motte; Maryland, USA) calibrated
with HACH Stablcal® turbidity standards prior to analysis. Turbidity was expressed in
nephelometric turbidity units (NTU).

2.5.5

pH

We measured pH with a pH meter (Orion 4 Star, ThermoScientific; Massachusetts, USA)
equipped with a glass electrode.

2.5.6

Sodium chloride content

Sodium chloride was quantified according to the Pharmacopeial methodology 35. In brief, 5.0
mL of each sample was diluted with distilled water, mixed with acetic acid and methanol,
and titrated with a standard solution of 0.1 mol/L silver nitrate. Eosin Y was used as the
indicator.

2.5.7

Osmolality

Osmolality was assessed by a cryoscopic technique using a micro-osmometer (3320,
Advanced Instrument; Massachusetts, USA) and a reference solution.

2.5.8

Phenol concentration

Phenol concentration was determined by a colorimetric assay36, using 4-aminoantipyrine and
potassium ferricyanide to form a derivative compound that absorbs at 505 nm.

2.5.9

Caprylic acid concentration

Caprylic acid concentration was quantified by RP-HPLC following Herrera et al.37 using a
liquid chromatographer (1220, Agilent Technologies; California, USA) equipped with an
Eclipse XDB-C8 5 m column (150 mm x 4.6 mm i.d.). The mobile phase was a mixture of
acetonitrile and water (60/40, v/v) and the flow rate was 1 mL/min. The UV detection was
set at 210 nm.

2.6 Microbiological analysis
2.6.1

Endotoxin assay

Endotoxins were detected and quantified using the gel clot method as described by Solano et
al.38. We added 0.2 mL of in-process and final product sample dilutions to single test vials of
Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL; Cat # 65003 Pyrotell®, ACC; Massachusetts, USA).
Dilutions of lipopolysaccharide standard (LPS; Cat # E0005, ACC) prepared with samples
were used as positive controls, and LAL Reagent Water (Cat # WP1001, ACC) was used as
a negative control. After 1h incubation at 37 °C, tubes were gently inverted 180° to assess
gelation of the mixture.

2.6.2

Sterility test

Sterility test was conducted according to USP 3735. A predetermined volume of anti-S1 and
anti-Mix products was aseptically filtered through a 0.22 µm pore membrane. Membranes
were cut into equal sizes, and each half was transferred to one of two types of culture media
suitable for the growth of fungi as well as aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. After
inoculation, media were incubated for 14 days at either 25 °C or 35 °C depending on the
media type. During and at the end of the incubation period, media were examined for
macroscopic evidence of microbial growth. Sterility compliance was dependent on the
absence of microbial growth.

2.7 Immunological analysis
2.7.1

Human COVID-19 convalescent plasma

Human convalescent plasma was used as a control. We used a mixture of plasma voluntarily
donated by 28 recovered SARS-CoV-2 patients. All patients provided informed consent and
tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with (1) anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG kit
(EI 2606-9601 G, EUROIMMUN; Lübeck, Germany), (2) MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV (SARSCoV-2) IgM and IgG kits (SNB-130219015M and SNB-130219016M, Snibe Diagnostics;
Shenzhen, China), and (3) Standard Q COVID-19 IgM/IgG Combo Test Kit (09COV50G,
SD Biosensor; Gyeonggi, Korea). All tests were performed according to manufacturer’s
instructions. The pool of convalescent plasma was freeze-dried and stored at -20 °C until use.

2.7.2

ELISA

Polystyrene plates (Costar 9017, Corning Inc.; New York, USA) were coated overnight at
room temperature with 0.5 g/well of S1 protein, 0.25 g/well of nucleocapsid protein, 1
g/well of mosaic protein or 0.5 g/well of RBD protein, depending on the experiment and
in duplicate. After washing the plates five times with distilled water, 100 L of equine plasma
or immunoglobulin formulation, diluted with 2% skim milk/PBS, were added to each well.
The plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and washed again five times.
Afterwards, 100 L of rabbit anti-equine IgG antibodies conjugated with peroxidase (A6917,
Sigma-Aldrich), diluted 1:3000 or 1:5000 with 2% skim milk/PBS, were added to each well.
Again, microplates were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. After a final washing step, color was
developed by the addition of H2O2 and o-phenylenediamine as a substrate (P9029, SigmaAldrich). Color development was stopped by the addition of 2.0 mol/L HCl. Absorbances

were recorded at 492 nm. For ELISA titration of final formulations, titer was calculated as
the dilution at which the absorbance was equal to five times the absorbance of a purified
normal equine plasma (normal equine immunoglobulins, NEI) diluted 1:1000.

2.7.3

Western blot

For Western blot analysis, viral proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE as described above.
Then, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and blocked with 1% skim
milk/PBS for 40 min at room temperature. The membrane was incubated with a dilution
1:1000 of either anti-S1 or anti-Mix samples in 0.1% skim milk/PBS for 1 h at 25 °C.
Subsequently, a second incubation was performed with a dilution 1:1000 of a rabbit antiequine IgG antibody conjugated with peroxidase. A precipitating chromogenic substrate (4Chloro-1-Naphthol; C6788, Sigma-Aldrich) was added.

2.7.4

Plaque Reduction Neutralization (PRNT)

Plaque Reduction Neutralization for anti-S1 and anti-Mix formulations and human
convalescent plasma was determined by assessing the ability of the samples to neutralize
SARS-CoV-2 virus (2019-nCoV/USA-WA1/2020). PRNT was performed at BSL-3
facilities. Samples were heat-inactivated for 30 minutes at 56 °C, and then diluted to
appropriate concentrations in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) (VWRL0102500, VWR Life Sciences; Pennsylvania, USA), supplemented with 5 % heat-inactivated fetal
bovine essence (FBE) (VWR10803-034, VWR Life Sciences), 1 % Penicillin/Streptomycin
(P/S) (15-140-122, Gibco Thermo Scientific) and 1 % L-Glutamine (VWRL0131-0100,
VWR Life Sciences). SARS-CoV-2 was diluted in supplemented DMEM to appropriate
concentration. Virus was then added to antibody samples and allowed to incubate for 1 hour

at 37 °C and 5 % CO2. After incubation, viral plaque assay was conducted to quantify viral
titers. 12-well plates were previously seeded with Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81; Virginia,
USA) at a density of 2 x 105 cells per well. Plates were inoculated for 1 hour at 37 °C and 5
% CO2. After infection, a 1:1 overlay consisting of 0.6 % agarose and 2X Eagle’s Minimum
Essential Medium without phenol red (115-073-101, Quality Biological; Maryland, USA),
supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) (10-437-028, Gibco Thermo Scientific),
non-essential amino acids (11140-050, Gibco Thermo Scientific), 1 mM sodium pyruvate
(25-000-Cl, Corning Inc.), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 % P/S was added to each well. Plates were
incubated at 37 °C for 48 hours. Cells were fixed with 10 % formaldehyde for 1 hour at room
temperature. Formaldehyde was aspirated and the agarose overlay was removed. Cells were
stained with crystal violet (1 % w/v in a 20 % ethanol solution). Viral titer of SARS-CoV-2
was determined by counting the number of plaques. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate.
The median effective dose (ED50) was calculated using Probit analysis and expressed as the
dilution factor of the formulations in which 50 % of the virus was detected. Alternatively,
neutralization was expressed as the ratio of protein concentration/ED 50 (µg/mL).

2.7.5

IgG-mediated activation of human Fcγ receptors (FcγR)

Activation of human FcγRIIIA (CD16) was assessed using a surrogate activation assay 39.
Briefly, IgG-dependent activation of BW:FcγRIIIA-ζ transfectants, i.e. BW5147 thymoma
cells (TIB-47TM ATCC; Virginia, USA), expressing the extracellular portion of human
FcγRIIIA (higher affinity variant with valine in position 158) fused to the mouse CD3 ζ–
chain, was measured. SARS-CoV-2 S1 and N proteins were coated on plates using coating
buffer (0.1 mol/L Na2HPO4, pH 9.0). After blocking with 5 % fetal calf serum (FCS), 20
mg/dL of either anti-S1, anti-Mix, or convalescent human plasma in DMEM 10 % (v/v) FCS

was added for 30 min at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2. To remove non-immune IgG,
plates were washed three times with DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FCS. Then, 100 000
BW:FcγRIIIA-ζ reporter cells per well in RPMI 10 % (v/v) FCS medium were added. After
co-cultivation for 16 h at 37 °C in a 5 % CO2 atmosphere, supernatants were diluted 1:2 in
ELISA sample buffer (PBS with 10 % [v/v] FCS and 0.1 % [v/v] Tween-20) and mIL-2 was
measured by ELISA using the capture Ab JES6-1A12 and the biotinylated detection Ab
JES6-5H4 at 450 nm (BD PharmingenTM; San Diego, USA). Experiments were performed in
triplicate.

2.8 Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using the software IBM® SPSS® Statistics v24 (New
York, USA). Results were expressed as means ± SD. A paired t-test was used to evaluate
hematocrit and hemoglobin values of horses before and after immunization. A repeated
measures ANOVA was used to investigate changes in the biochemical parameters of the
horses during plasma production, and values were corrected by the Greenhouse-Geisser
factor when needed. A two-way independent ANOVA was conducted to assess ELISA
absorbance of formulations and antigens. A Bonferroni post-hoc analysis was performed to
elucidate differences among groups. Additionally, a bootstrap BCa 95% CI was performed
to validate the assumption of the equality of variances. All P-values < 0.05 were considered
significantly different. ED50 values were considered significantly different if confidence
intervals at 95% did not overlap.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 SARS-CoV-2 recombinant proteins
Structural SARS-CoV-2 recombinant S1, N, and SEM mosaic proteins were used as
immunogens for the preparation of equine formulations. S1 forms part of the transmembrane
spike (S) glycoprotein homotrimer located at the viral surface. S is composed of S1 and S2
subunit domains, and is the main protein responsible for recognition of the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor via the receptor binding domain (RBD) at the Nterminal S1 subunit5,6. Thus, S is the most suitable target for immunoglobulin-based therapy
for COVID-191,40. Both S1 and S2 subunits of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2,
specially conformational epitopes at S1, and particularly at RBD41–44, have served as targets
for developing neutralizing antibodies to disable receptor interactions and block viral entry
to host cells. Also, during SARS-CoV infection, it was demonstrated that protective humoral
and T-cellular immunity is induced by S protein45.
Nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) plays an essential role in genome packaging, virion
assembly, replication, and transcription46. This protein is highly expressed during infection47,
and several serological studies of COVID-19 convalescent patients have reported
seropositivity against N47–51. Antibody response to N protein is similar to RBD reactivity 52,
and therefore may contribute to some extent of the preliminary efficacy seen with human
convalescent plasma therapies15.
Membrane (M) protein is the most abundant of the structural proteins in the virus. This
transmembrane protein coordinates virus assembly by interacting with the other structural
proteins53. In contrast, the role of the envelope (E) protein is not entirely understood; this
viroporin is expressed profusely during viral replication cycles, and has been implicated in

viral assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis53,54. Immunization of horses
with VLPs expressing MERS-CoV S, M and E proteins has successfully induced neutralizing
antibodies against MERS-CoV24.
Here, we used SARS-CoV-2 recombinant S1 protein (produced in baculovirus insect
cells), N protein (expressed in E. coli), and SEM mosaic (an E. coli derived recombinant
protein containing the S, E, and M immunodominant regions) as immunogens to produce two
formulations of equine immunoglobulins: anti-S1 (towards S1 protein) and anti-Mix
(towards a mixture of S1, N, and SEM mosaic proteins). Additionally, we used recombinant
RBD (expressed in HEK293 cells) for immunoreactivity and quality control assessment.
Before immunization, we verified the purity of viral protein preparations with SDSPAGE analysis (Fig. 1) and found that S1 protein was represented by a ~85 kDa band of high
purity (94%). N protein showed a band of ~57 kDa and 75% purity. SEM mosaic protein
presented only two bands at 85 kDa (S protein) and 13 kDa (E protein). RBD protein showed
a 34 kDa band that represented 95% of the preparation. The identity of all recombinant
proteins was confirmed by mass spectrometry (nESI-MS/MS; results not shown). Toxicity
of recombinant proteins used as immunogens was assessed in a murine model, where no
evidence of toxicity was observed (results not shown).

3.2 Production of anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune plasma
3.2.1 Immunization, antibody response, and clinical evaluation of horses
An ideal design for an adequate immunization strategy takes into consideration several
factors. For example, the immunogenicity of proteins is closely related to their structural
characteristics such as molecular mass, tertiary and quaternary structure, and post-

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.17.343863; this version posted October 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

translational modifications. Similarly, optimal immunization procedures can vary depending
on the animal model, administration route, use of immunological adjuvants, dose, and
frequency of boosters. After the first injection of foreign proteins, naïve lymphocytes are
recruited and activated by antigen-presenting cells, leading to the proliferation and creation
of memory T and B cells. In turn, plasma B cells produce specific antibodies, whose affinity
and specificity most likely mature after each booster55. In this experiment, immunization of
horses followed the scheme summarized in Table 1. During immunization, antibody
responses varied among individual horses. In general, antibody titers started to increase 15
days after priming, and reached a plateau at the maximum anti-viral antibody level around 7
weeks (52 days; Fig. 2). Others have reported maximum antibody responses 6–7 weeks after
immunizing horses with SARS-CoV particles20,21, and 4-6 weeks after immunizing horses
with SARS-CoV-2 RBD25,26 and trimeric S protein27. In this study, horses in anti-S1 and antiMix groups showed similar dynamics in their development of plasma concentrations of
antibodies towards S1 (Fig. 2a), which is not surprising because both groups received the S1
immunogen at the same dosage, schedule, and method of administration. Antibodies towards
N protein were only developed by horses in the anti-Mix group (Fig. 2b).
Because RBD is a domain of S15,6, we anticipated and observed that both groups would
show similar responses towards RBD, even though it was not used as an immunogen (Fig.
2c). Also, despite the fact that only the anti-Mix group was immunized against the SEM
mosaic, both groups of horses developed a similar antibody response towards this
immunogen (Fig. 2d); presumably, the S immunodominant region contained in the mosaic
masked the responses to E and M proteins.
Throughout the immunization schedule, animals used for hyperimmune plasma
production should be under rigorous veterinary care, ensuring that the health and welfare of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.17.343863; this version posted October 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

each animal are closely monitored, and ethical guidelines are appropriately met. During this
process, the stimulation of a local inflammation is expected for the production of a cellular
infiltrate, which at the beginning is mainly composed of neutrophils and at the end by
antigen-presenting cells55.
In our study, horses developed local inflammation and signs of minor pain and discomfort
such as lameness or abnormal gait, which lasted in most cases two days after each booster.
However, the use of an anti-inflammatory drug was necessary for pain relief in two horses in
the anti-Mix group. The complete and incomplete Freund´s adjuvants produced fistulation
with minor pus-like discharge between 2 and 3 weeks after each injection. In spite of their
proven adjuvant efficacy and depot effect, it is recommended to limit the use of these
adjuvants to the beginning of the immunization protocol because they are known to cause
local injuries56. Therefore, for the third booster, we selected Emulsigen-D adjuvant, which
only produced some ventral edema on anti-Mix horses.
At the end of the immunization scheme, the immunogen dose was reduced from 1 mg to
0.5 mg of each immunogen to reduce inflammatory effects and to ration immunogen use.
Overall, milder inflammation was observed in the anti-S group than in the anti-Mix group.
This difference may result from protein interactions in the anti-Mix preparation and/or the
fact that the anti-Mix group received 3 mg of total immunogen versus only 1 mg in the antiS1 group. Nonetheless, further studies are necessary to confirm these hypotheses.
Hematological parameters were analyzed regularly throughout the immunization scheme,
and before bleeding (Table 2). Slight decreases in hematocrit and hemoglobin were observed
in some horses, but were not statistically significant (F= 0.550, df= 5, P= 0.606; F= 1.179,
df= 5, P= 0.291, respectively). Nonetheless, the veterinary team treated horses with an

antianemic vitamin complex (Complemil500®, Kyrovet Laboratories; Bogotá, Colombia) to
ensure a safe blood extraction process.
In general, biochemical analysis of horse serum showed normal values, although some
measures varied significantly during hyperimmune plasma production (Table 2; P < 0.05).
Pre-bleeding analysis revealed a significant increase in total protein and globulins and a
decrease of albumin as a direct consequence of hyperimmunization and production of antiSARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Potassium values decreased below the normal range, an
observation also reported by Angulo et al.31 in horses injected with snake venoms for
antivenom manufacture. Although there was a slight rise in the levels of gamma glutamyl
transferase (GGT) and creatine kinase (CK) enzymes, which may reflect some hepatic and
tissue damage. Nonetheless, those changes were not significantly different than baseline
serum values (P ˃ 0.05). Results suggest a possible effect of virus proteins or adjuvants on
the electrolyte profile and protein balance of plasma producing animals.

3.2.2 Bleeding for hyperimmune plasma collection
We bled horses when the maximum anti-viral antibody level against all immunogens
reached a plateau (Fig. 2). First, horses underwent physical examination, including
evaluation of body condition, auscultation of cardiorespiratory and digestive systems, and
hematological tests. Strict veterinary surveillance was maintained throughout bleeding, selftransfusion, and post-bleeding.
Bleeding was performed across three consecutive days. Horses had access to water and
food ad libitum. By the end of the process, an average of 9.2 ± 1.0 L plasma was collected
from each horse. Bleeding and plasma separation were performed by specialized technicians.

Laboratories, equipment, and a closed system of blood collection bags were designed to
operate with refined aseptic technique. All the plasma bags tested negatively to endotoxins,
containing less than 1.5 EU/mL, and met all the specifications required to be included in the
plasma pools for the immunoglobulin purification process.
Bleeding resulted in no adverse acute or chronic physiological alterations. Some minor
shifts were observed in serum biochemical parameters, but within accepted ranges (Table 2)
as reported by Cunha et al.27. Horses showed an expected decrease in total protein and
globulins concentration after bleeding, as a consequence of the removal of plasma proteins.
After a 2-month rest period, animals recovered to normal status, and were ready to initiate a
new cycle of immunization and bleeding.

3.3 Pilot scale antisera production and quality control of final products
3.3.1 Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin purification
To prepare antisera, hyperimmune plasma was pooled by immunization group (28.9 kg
anti-S1 plasma and 26.5 kg anti-Mix plasma), and subsequently fractionated by caprylic acid
precipitation. This method is routinely used at the Instituto Clodomiro Picado of the
University of Costa Rica for the manufacture of whole-IgG antivenoms, and produces
satisfactory yield and adequate purity of preparations32. The antivenoms generated using this
fractionation protocol have proven safe and effective in clinical trials in patients suffering
snakebite envenomings57–59.
Caprylic acid has the advantage of precipitating non-IgG proteins from plasma, while
leaving the pharmacologically active ingredient – the immunoglobulins – in solution32. The
advantage of this method is that IgG aggregation is circumvented. After precipitation,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.17.343863; this version posted October 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

insoluble material was removed by filtration, producing a clarified solution enriched in
plasma immunoglobulins.
Once purified, whole-IgG preparations were properly formulated in compliance with
quality control specifications (Table 3). Solutions were dialyzed and concentrated to remove
caprylic acid (Table 3; ≤ 250 mg/L), and to reach final protein concentration. Additionally,
pH, osmolality, and ionic strength were adjusted to values compatible with parenteral
administration, and phenol was added as a preservative (Table 3).
Finally, a 0.22 µm-filtration was performed prior to aseptic filling of vials as a final
sterilization step to avoid contamination with potential pathogens such as bacteria, protozoa,
and fungi. After downstream processing of the formulations, we filled 612 and 479 vials
containing 10 mL of purified and concentrated anti-S1 and anti-Mix products, respectively.
In other words, we obtained approximately 20 vials/L plasma.
Because heterologous formulations are animal plasma-derived products, there is a
theoretical concern regarding transmission of viral infectious agents. To prevent this
possibility, viral risk assessment needs to be performed via rigorous control of the viral load
of the raw material, as well as evaluation of both existing and intentionally introduced
antiviral steps during production56. The use of caprylic acid in the production of snake
antivenoms also works as an antiviral step for enveloped viruses, reducing viral loads by up
to 5 log10 for several model viruses60. Previously, we have found that precipitation of equine
plasma with 6 % caprylic acid reduces infectivity of human herpesvirus (HSV-1) in Vero
cells by more than 5 log10 within 5 minutes of adding the precipitating agent (our unpublished
data). Moreover, 0.25 % phenol has been reported as an efficient virucidal agent of enveloped
viruses when added to final formulations of snake antivenoms 61. Therefore, our anti-SARS-

CoV-2 formulations were produced with a methodology that has been previously validated
as having two viral inactivation steps.

3.3.2 Physicochemical and microbiological assessment of final products
A comparison between various physicochemical parameters of both formulations is
presented in Table 3. Both preparations complied with quality control specifications. The
immunoglobulin monomer content of both products indicated that they have few soluble
protein aggregates, and the turbidity due to insoluble aggregates was low. This may be
relevant in terms of the safety profile of the product, because the presence of aggregates of
immunoglobulins in heterologous formulations has been proposed as one of the main causes
of early adverse reactions62. Endotoxin and sterility tests were fully compliant, which also
supports the microbiological safety profile of the preparations.
Figure 3 (lanes 2 and 4) shows the electrophoretic profiles of the formulations. Both
compare favorably in terms of purity (Table 3; ˃ 90%) and presented a predominant band
with a molecular mass corresponding to whole IgG ~150 kDa. As a result of the efficacy of
purification by caprylic acid, there are only traces of protein contaminants.

3.3.3 Immunological assessment of final products
3.3.3.1 Immunoreactivity
The ELISA antibody response of anti-S1 and anti-Mix formulations towards the four
recombinant proteins used as immunogens was significantly different (F= 797.529, df= 2;24,
P< 0.0001; Fig. 4a). Such immunoreactivity agrees with that seen during horse immunization,
as the anti-S1 formulation recognized both S1 and RBD and the anti-Mix formulation

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.17.343863; this version posted October 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

recognized S1, N, and RBD. Anti-RBD immunoreactivity was higher with the anti-Mix
formulation (P < 0.05), whereas the SEM mosaic was poorly recognized by both anti-S1 (ẍ=
0.118 [0.101 – 0.146] 95% Bca) and anti-Mix (ẍ= 0.198 [0.191 – 0.203] 95% Bca)
formulations.
The ELISA titers of the final products towards S1 and N was calculated in reference to a
normal equine immunoglobulin preparation (NEI) (Table 3). The anti-S1 formulation
presented a higher titer against S1 than the anti-Mix formulation, whereas only anti-Mix
showed immunoreactivity towards the nucleocapsid viral protein.
The Western blot results (Fig. 4b) agree with the ELISA findings, i.e. anti-S1 formulation
immunoreacted with several bands of S1, particularly at 85 kDa band, and with RBD; while
anti-Mix formulation immunoreacted with bands of S1, N and RBD proteins. It is worth
mentioning that when compared to the electrophoretic profile of viral proteins (Fig. 1), more
immunodetected bands appeared in S1 and N, suggesting the presence of other proteins in
the recombinant preparations, probably remnants of the upstream process. Because we used
proteins that were expressed in non-human cells, there is no risk that immunization could
have resulted in the production of equine antibodies towards human proteins that could
induce adverse effects.

3.3.3.2 Neutralization profile of final products
We evaluated the ability of the final formulations to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection in
vitro on Vero cells. In general, SARS-CoV-2 inhibition was dose-dependent (Fig. 5). The
dilution factor at which the formulations neutralized 50% of the virus (ED50) was 1:29108
(1:26885-1:31643) for anti-S1 and 1:25355 (1:22659-1:58594) for anti-Mix. In previous
studies, heterologous formulations towards SARS-CoV-2 RBD were also able to neutralize

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.17.343863; this version posted October 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

the infectivity of the virus in cells25,26, evidencing that the use of RBD as an immunogen can
indeed trigger strong immunoreactivity and neutralization of the virus. Likewise, Cunha and
colleagues27 showed that immunization of horses with a trimeric spike protein (comprised of
both S1 and S2 subunits) generated a formulation with potent in vitro neutralizing ability.
Here, we demonstrated that immunization of horses with recombinant S1 elicited a strong
humoral response. Such a strong neutralizing capacity is most likely due to the presence of
anti-RBD antibodies and other antibodies directed towards S protein epitopes such as the Nterminal domain (NTD)44. During the pre-incubation phase of the PRNT assay with both antiS1 and anti-Mix formulations, a similar potency of anti-S1 antibodies recognized and bound
S1 on the viral surface, neutralizing the infection capacity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus6 (Fig.
5).
Given that N protein is an internal antigen, its interaction with specific antibodies in a
PRNT assay is unlikely. Thus, we could not assess the contribution of anti-N antibodies to
viral neutralization in this study. However, vaccines that have been developed against SARSCoV and MERS-CoV with targets other than the S protein did not successfully protect
animals from infection10,63. The contribution of anti-N antibodies to the control of COVID19 requires further study.
In terms of the total protein of the formulations required to neutralize 50 % of the viral
infection capacity (total protein/ED50), the anti-S1 formulation required 2.3 μg/mL and the
anti-Mix formulation required 2.5 μg/mL. Another formulation tested by Pan and
colleagues25 required 8.8 μg/mL, whereas a formulation reported by Zylberman et al.26
reached titer values of 1:10240 with 3 g/dL of total protein. An anti-trimeric S-formulation
resulted in a PRNT50 of 1:32000 at 9 g/dL total protein27. However, because different
methodologies were used to assess the neutralizing ability of the above noted formulations,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.17.343863; this version posted October 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

it would be more appropriate to compare our formulations with convalescent plasma as a
control. In this study, ED50 (95% CI) of convalescent plasma was 1:339 (1:295-1:386). In
other words, anti-S1 and anti-Mix formulations were 80 times more potent than the
convalescent plasma pool (Fig. 5), and a 10-mL vial of equine-derived formulation would be
equivalent to 800 mL of human convalescent plasma from donors pre-selected for having a
high anti-SARS-CoV-2 titer. These findings are consistent with previous reports26,27.
Although the neutralizing potency of the formulations in cell culture is a useful
characteristic, it does not necessarily predict clinical efficacy, which also depends on whether
antibodies can reach compartments in which the antigen is distributed. Therefore, only
properly designed clinical trials can demonstrate the clinical efficacy of heterologous
formulations against COVID-19. Once the potency specification of the formulations is
established via clinical studies, then cell culture assays can verify consistency and
specification compliance within batches in an industrial line.

3.3.3.3 Anti-SARS-CoV-2 equine IgG-mediated activation of human Fcγ receptors (FcγRs)
A surrogate assay was used to evaluate the in vitro capacity of equine formulations to
trigger the activation of human FcγRIIIA (CD16) (Fig. 6). This assay comprised the cocultivation of anti-viral IgG, previously incubated with S1 and N proteins, with mouse
BW:FcγRIIIA-ζ reporter cells expressing the extracellular portion of chimeric human
FcγRIIIA. Activation of FcγRIIIA via recognition of the IgG-Fc portion was then determined
by measuring IL-2 secretion as a marker39. When compared to normal equine IgG (Fig. 6,
bar 4), both anti-S1 and anti-Mix formulations induced the secretion of IL-2 (Fig. 6, bars 1
and 2). According to their immunoreactivity, both formulations interacted with S1 protein,
and only the anti-Mix formulation reacted to N protein. A pool of anti-SARS-CoV-2 high-

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.17.343863; this version posted October 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

titer convalescent human plasma showed significantly higher IL-2 secretion than equine
formulations against both S1 and N viral proteins (P < 0.005; Fig. 6, bar 3).
Interestingly, our results evidence some capacity of equine IgG to interact and activate
human FcγRIIIA in vitro, suggesting the possibility of being able also to activate human
FcγRs in vivo. This finding has several implications in terms of the antiviral mechanism of
action and the safety profile of the formulations.
Under this scenario, in addition to neutralizing the viral proteins, anti-viral
immunoglobulins may also mediate downstream effector functions via interaction with Fcreceptors in immune cells10,64. Such an interaction could lead to the killing of virus-infected
cells by effector mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
(ADCC). For example, FcγRIIIA could interact with natural killer cells, or, if equine IgG
are able to interact with other human FcγRs, through stimulation of antibody-dependent
cellular phagocytosis (ADCP)65. Overall, the activation of human FcγRs may represent a
clinical advantage of non-digested formulations over F(ab)´2 formulations, although this
hypothesis remains to be tested in clinical studies.
At the same time, there are theoretical safety concerns related with the possibility that
antiviral hyperimmune immunoglobulin formulations could induce an immune enhancement
of the viral disease. Non-neutralizing, low-affinity, or sub-neutralizing concentrations of
antibodies that may engage functional responses from human FcγRs, could lead to antibodydependent enhancement (ADE) or antibody-enhanced immunopathology8,10,64,65. Even
though ADE and acute lung injury have been reported during SARS-CoV infection in nonhuman models and cell culture studies66–69, there is still no compelling clinical,
epidemiological or histopathological evidence to support ADE or antibody-enhanced
immunopathology of COVID-19 infection or re-infection in humans10,70, or during human

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.17.343863; this version posted October 19, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

plasma convalescent therapy9. However, both phenomena should be considered as latent
risks. Therefore, further studies to elucidate the pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection as well
as strict vigilance during passive immunotherapy with antiviral immunoglobulin
formulations are crucial.
In contrast to our protocol, other anti-viral heterologous formulations for the treatment of
severe acute respiratory syndromes have included an enzymatic digestion of IgG with pepsin
to generate divalent F(ab′)2 preparations. Generally, the rationale for Fc removal is to prevent
the development of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)20,21,24–27 and early adverse
reactions mediated by the Fc fragment of horse immunoglobulins20,21. However, in the particular
case of equine antivenoms, similar incidences of early adverse reactions have been reported for
F(ab’)2 antivenoms and whole IgG preparations produced by caprylic acid precipitation59,62,
suggesting that the presence of Fc fragment in the preparation is not the main culprit for these
reactions. Additionally, immunoglobulin fragments have shorter half-lives than whole IgG
preparations, which confers an advantage to non-digested formulations in terms of active
ingredient residence time during administration 42,71. Clarification of the relative efficacy and
safety of F(ab´)2 and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 formulations is an important task that must be
addressed in the near future.

Concluding remarks
Taking advantage of our experience with manufacturing snake antivenom, we developed
two equine-IgG formulations (anti-S1 and anti-Mix) by immunizing horses with SARS-CoV2 recombinant proteins S1, N, and SEM mosaic. Formulations were prepared with a simple,
cost-effective, and scalable methodology, and showed high physicochemical and
microbiological quality. We demonstrated that horses can produce large quantities of

antibodies with high neutralizing potency of the virus in vitro, due to the presence of anti-S1
and anti-RBD immunoglobulins in the final products, which demonstrated to be 80 times
more potent than a pool of human convalescent plasma. Both formulations have similar preclinical quality, safety, and efficacy profiles, but are yet to be validated with proper clinical
trials. We suggest that the technological platform presented here could be adapted by other
equine immunoglobulin producers worldwide to provide this potential treatment of COVID19 in other regions, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

1
Formulations were adjusted to a similar protein concentration.
2
Monomer content is expressed as the relative percent of monomeric immunoglobulin
proteins as analyzed by size exclusion chromatography.
3
Turbidity is expressed in nephelometric turbidity units (NTU).
4
Endotoxin limit was calculated as the quotient K/M, where K is the threshold pyrogenic
dose of endotoxin per kilogram of body weight (5 EU/kg), and M is the maximum total dose
administered to a 70 kg-patient for 1 h. Based on our results, the recommended dose for antiS1 and anti-Mix formulations is 10 mL. Therefore, the acceptable endotoxin limit for this
formulation is: (5 EU/kg)/(10 mL/70 kg) = 35 EU/mL.
5
ELISA titer was calculated as the dilution at which the sample absorbance was equal to five
times the absorbance of a normal equine immunoglobulin preparation (NEI) diluted 1:1000.
6
This specification will be established after evaluation of the formulations in a clinical study.
Data are expressed as mean ± SD.
