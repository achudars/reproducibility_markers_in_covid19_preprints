SUMMARY

36

The relative resistance of SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 to antibody

37

neutralization has been described recently. We now report that another emergent

38

variant from Brazil, P.1, is not only refractory to multiple neutralizing monoclonal

39

antibodies, but also more resistant to neutralization by convalescent plasma (3.4

40

fold) and vaccinee sera (3.8-4.8 fold). The cryo-electron microscopy structure of

41

a soluble prefusion-stabilized spike reveals the P.1 trimer to adopt exclusively a

42

conformation in which one of the receptor-binding domains is in the “up”

43

position, with the functional impact of mutations appearing to arise from local

44

changes instead of global conformational alterations. The P.1 variant threatens

45

current antibody therapies but less so the protective efficacy of our vaccines.

46

47

SARS-CoV-2 P.1, emerging from the B.1.1.28 lineage, has become a dominant variant

48

in Brazil (Faria, 2021; Naveca, 2021). P.1 contains 10 spike mutations in addition to

49

D614G, including K417T, E484K, and N501Y in the receptor-binding domain (RBD),

50

L18F, T20N, P26S, D138Y and R190S in the N-terminal domain (NTD), and H655Y

51

near the furin cleavage site. This new variant could threaten the efficacy of current

52

monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies or vaccines, because it shares mutations at the

53

same three RBD residues with B.1.351, a variant that first emerged from South Africa

54

(Tegally et al., 2021). We and others (Liu et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021; Wu et al.,

55

2021) have shown that B.1.351 is more resistant to neutralization by some mAbs,

56

convalescent plasma, and vaccinee sera, in part due to a E484K mutation that also

57

exists in P.1.

We therefore obtained the P.1 authentic virus and also created, as

previously described (Liu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021), a VSVbased SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus with all 10 mutations of the P.1 variant (BZ∆10), and

60

assessed their susceptibility to neutralization by 18 neutralizing mAbs, 20 convalescent

61

plasma, and 22 vaccinee sera as previously reported (Wang et al., 2021).

62

63

We first assayed the neutralizing activity of four mAbs with emergency use authorization

64

(EUA), including REGN10987 (imdevimab), REGN10933 (casirivimab) (Hansen et al.,

65

2020), LY-CoV555 (bamlanivimab) (Chen et al., 2021; Gottlieb et al., 2021), and CB6

66

(etesevimab) (Gottlieb et al., 2021; Shi et al., 2020) against P.1 pseudovirus (BZ∆10)

67

and authentic virus, alongside with their wildtype (WT or WA1) counterparts. As shown

68

in Figure 1A (left panel) and Figure S1A, the neutralizing activities of three of the mAbs

69

with EUA were markedly or completely abolished against P.1. The only mAb with EUA

70

retaining its activity was REGN10987. We next tested the neutralizing activity of eight

71

additional RBD mAbs, including ones from our own collection (2-15, 2-7, 1-57, & 2-36)

72

(Liu et al., 2020) as well as S309 (Pinto et al., 2020), COV2-2196 & COV2-2130 (Zost et

73

al., 2020), and C121 (Robbiani et al., 2020). The neutralizing activities of the two potent

74

mAbs targeting the receptor-binding motif, 2-15 and C121, were completely lost against

75

P.1 (Figure 1A, middle panel, and Figure S1A). Other mAbs targeting the “inner side” or

76

the “outer side” of RBD retained their activities against P.1, however. Overall, the data

77

on pseudovirus and authentic virus were in agreement, and the findings on P.1 mimic

78

those observed for B.1.351 (Wang et al., 2021), which should not be surprising since

79

the triple RBD mutations in P.1 and B.1.351 are largely the same.

81

We also assessed the neutralizing activity of six NTD mAbs (Liu et al., 2020) against the

82

P.1 pseudovirus and authentic virus (Figure 1A, right panel; and Figure S1B). P.1 was

83

profoundly resistant to neutralization by four NTD antibodies: 2-17, 4-18, 4-19, and 5-7.

84

Interestingly, 5-24 and 4-8, two mAbs targeting the antigenic supersite in NTD (Cerutti

85

et al., 2021) that have completely lost neutralizing activity against B.1.351 (Wang et al.,

86

2021), remained active against P.1. To understand the specific mutations responsible

87

for the observed pattern of neutralization, we then tested these NTD mAbs against a

88

panel of pseudoviruses, each containing only a single NTD mutation found in P.1

89

(Figure S1B). As expected, 5-24 ad 4-8 retained activity against all single-mutation

90

pseudoviruses. P26S only partially accounted for the loss of activity of 4-18; L18F,

91

T20N, and D138Y contributed to the loss of activity of 2-17 and 4-19; and L18F, T20N,

92

D138Y, and R190S together resulted in the loss of activity of 5-7.

93

94

We also examined a panel of convalescent plasma obtained from 20 SARS-CoV-2

95

patients infected in the Spring of 2020, as previously reported (Wang et al., 2021).

96

Each plasma sample was assayed for neutralization against the P.1 pseudovirus and

97

authentic virus in parallel with their WT counterparts. As shown in Figure S1C, many

98

samples lost >2-fold neutralizing activity against BZ∆10 and P.1. The magnitude of the

99

drop in plasma neutralization ID50 titers is summarized in Figure 1B (left panel),

100

showing a 6.5-fold loss of activity against the variant pseudovirus and a 3.4-fold loss of

101

activity against the authentic virus.

Twenty-two vaccinee sera were obtained, as previously reported (Wang et al., 2021),

104

from 12 individuals who received Moderna SARS-Co-2 mRNA-1273 Vaccine (Anderson

105

et al., 2020) and 10 individuals who received the Pfizer BNT162b2 Covid-19 Vaccine

(Polack et al., 2020).

BZ∆10 and P.1 together with WT viruses. The extent of the decline in neutralization

108

activity is summarized in Figure 1B (middle and right panels), and each neutralization

109

profile is shown in Figure S1D. A loss of activity against BZ∆10 and P.1 was noted for

110

every sample, but the magnitude of the loss was modest (2.2-2.8 fold for the

111

pseudovirus; 3.8-4.8 fold for the authentic virus) and not as striking as was observed

112

against B.1.351 (6.5-8.6 fold for pseudovirus; 10.3-12.4 fold for authentic virus) (Wang

113

et al., 2021).

Each serum sample was assayed for neutralization against

114

115

To provide insight into the mechanisms of antibody resistance, we determined the

116

structure of the 2-proline-stabilized P.1 spike protein at 3.8 Å resolution by single-

117

particle cryo-EM reconstruction (Figures 2 and S2, Table S1). Overall, the structure of

118

the P.1 spike was highly similar to the D614G variant (Korber et al., 2020; Yurkovetskiy

119

et al., 2020) with 3D classes observed only for the single-RBD-up conformation. This

120

was expected, as the D614G mutation, contained in P1, appears to favor the one-up

121

orientation of RBD, which is required for ACE2 binding and recognition by some RBD-

122

directed antibodies. Structural mobility was observed with the raised RBD (protomer B),

123

but not with protomers A and C, which were in the down orientation (Video S1). Map

124

density was well satisfied by the previously reported single-up structure (PDB 6XM0) for

125

the majority of the trimer, except in three regions. Residues 310-322 in protomer B

126

traced a different path; residues 623-632 were disordered in protomers A and B, and

127

partially ordered in protomer C; and residues 828-853 were disordered in protomers A

128

and C, and partially ordered in protomer B. Notably, two of these regions around

129

residues 320 and 840 were previously observed to “refold” between the single-up and

130

the low-pH all-RBD-down conformation (Zhou et al., 2020), suggesting these regions

131

are generally more mobile – and in this case, sensitive to mutation-induced

132

conformational changes.

133

134

Because of the high overall conformational similarity to the D614G structure, we infer

135

the functional impact of the P.1 mutation to arise primarily from local changes in

136

structure. Other than H655Y and T1027I, all of the mutations occur within NTD or RBD,

137

which are the targets of neutralizing antibodies. For NTD, the N-terminus was

138

disordered until residue 27, so we were unable to visualize mutations at residue 18, 20,

139

and 26. Mutation D138Y is located in the center of the NTD supersite (Cerutti et al.,

140

2021), explaining its impact on NTD antibodies 2-17 and 4-19 (Fig. S1B), whereas

141

R190S is mostly occluded from the NTD surface (Fig. 2B). For RBD, the three

142

mutations at K417T, E484K and N501Y are all located in the ACE2-binding region and

143

overlap epitopes for multiple neutralizing antibodies. Their relatively equal spatial

144

separation (Fig. 2C) allow them to impact a substantial portion of the ACE2-binding

145

surface.

146

147

Overall, the SARS-CoV-2 P.1 variant is of concern because of its rapid rise to

148

dominance as well as its extensive spike mutations, which could lead to antigenic

149

changes detrimental to mAb therapies and vaccine protection. Here we report that P.1

150

is indeed resistant to neutralization by several RBD-directed mAbs, including three with

151

EUA. The major culprit is the E484K mutation, which has emerged independently in

152

over 50 lineages, including in B.1.526 that we (Annavajhala et al., 2021) and others

153

(West et al., 2021) have identified in New York recently. As for the NTD-directed mAbs,

154

the resistance profiles are markedly different between P.1 and B.1.351, reflecting their

155

distinct sets of mutations in NTD. Both convalescent plasma and vaccinee sera show a

156

significant loss of neutralizing activity against P.1, but the diminution is not as great as

157

that reported against B.1.351 (Garcia-Beltran et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021).

158

Therefore, the threat of increased re-infection or decreased vaccine protection posed by

159

P.1 may not be as severe as B.1.351. Finally, given that the RBD mutations are largely

160

the same for these two variants, the discrepancy in their neutralization susceptibility to

161

polyclonal plasma or sera suggests that NTD mutations can have a significant effect on

162

the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to antibody neutralization.

229

Monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma, and vaccinee sera were the same as

230

previously reported (Wang et al., 2021).

231

Pseudovirus neutralization assays

232

Plasmids encoding the single-mutation variants found in P.1 and 10-mutation variant

233

(BZΔ10) were generated by Quikchange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent).

234

Recombinant Indiana VSV (rVSV) expressing different SARS-CoV-2 spike variants

235

were generated as previously described (Liu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Wang et

236

al., 2021). Neutralization assays were performed by incubating pseudoviruses with

237

serial dilutions of mAbs or heat-inactivated plasma or sera, and scored by the reduction

238

in luciferase gene expression as previously described (Liu et al., 2020; Wang et al.,

239

2020; Wang et al., 2021). Briefly, Vero E6 cells (ATCC) were seeded in 96-well plates

240

(2 ×104 cells per well). Pseudoviruses were incubated with serial dilutions of the test

241

samples in triplicate for 30 min at 37 °C. The mixture was added to cultured cells and

242

incubated for an additional 16 hrs. Luminescence was measured using Luciferase

243

Assay System (Promega), and IC50 was defined as the dilution at which the relative light

244

units were reduced by 50% compared with the virus control wells (virus + cells) after

245

subtraction of the background in the control groups with cells only. The IC50 values were

246

calculated using a five-parameter dose-response curve in GraphPad Prism.

247

Authentic SARS-CoV-2 Microplate Neutralization

248

The SARS-CoV-2 viruses USA-WA1/2020 (WA1), and hCoV-19/Japan/TY7-503/2021

249

(P.1) were obtained from BEI Resources (NIAID, NIH). The deposited virus (Passage 2

250

in Vero E6/TMPRSS2 cells) was reported to have an additional mutation as compared

251

to

252

EPI_ISL_877769). The viruses were propagated for one passage using Vero E6 cells.

253

Virus infectious titer was determined by an end-point dilution and cytopathic effect

254

(CPE) assay on Vero E6 cells as described previously (Liu et al., 2020; Wang et al.,

255

2020; Wang et al., 2021).

256

An end-point-dilution microplate neutralization assay was performed to measure the

257

neutralization activity of convalescent plasma samples, vaccinee sera, and purified

258

mAbs. Triplicates of each dilution were incubated with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.1 in

259

EMEM with 7.5% inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) for 1 hour at 37oC. Post incubation,

260

the virus-antibody mixture was transferred onto a monolayer of Vero E6 cells grown

261

overnight. The cells were incubated with the mixture for ~70 hrs. CPE was visually

262

scored for each well in a blinded fashion by two independent observers. The results

263

were then converted into percentage neutralization at a given sample dilution or mAb

264

concentration, and the averages ± SEM were plotted using a five-parameter dose-

265

response curve in GraphPad Prism.

266

Cryo-EM data collection and processing

267

2µL P.1 spike protein at a concentration of 2 mg/ml was incubated in 10 mM Hepes pH

268

the

clinical

isolate:

protein

F184V

(GISAID:

7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.005% n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) was incubated on C-

269

flat 1.2/1.3 carbon grids for 30 seconds and vitrified using a Vitrobot plunge freezer.

270

Data were collected on a Titan Krios electron microscope operating at 300 kV, equipped

271

with a Gatan K3 direct electron detector and energy filter, using the Leginon software

272

package (Suloway et al., 2005). A total electron fluence of 51.69 e-/Å2 was fractionated

273

over 40 frames, with a total exposure time of 2.0 seconds. A magnification of 81,000x

274

resulted in a pixel size of 1.058 Å, and a defocus range of -0.4 to -3.5 µm was used.

275

276

All processing was done using cryoSPARC v2.15.0 (Punjani et al., 2017). Raw movies

277

were aligned and dose-weighted using patch motion correction, and the CTF was

278

estimated using patch CTF estimation. A small subset of approximately 200

279

micrographs were picked using blob picker, followed by 2D classification and manual

280

curation of particle picks, and used to train a Topaz neural network. This network was

281

then used to pick particles from the remaining micrographs, which were extracted with a

282

box size of 384 pixels.

283

284

Cryo-EM model building

285

We used PDB 6XM0, one of the most complete coronavirus spike structures, as a

286

starting model. The model was docked to the map using Chimera. The model was then

287

fitted interactively using COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) with real space refinement

288

performed in Phenix 1.18 (Adams et al., 2004).

289

Molprobity (Davis et al., 2004) and EMRinger (Barad et al., 2015). The model was

290

submitted to the PDB with PDB ID XXX. Figures were prepared using UCSF ChimeraX

291

(Goddard et al., 2018).

Validation was performed using
