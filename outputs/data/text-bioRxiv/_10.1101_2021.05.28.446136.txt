Abstract

28

The uses of bivalve molluscs in environmental biomonitoring have recently gained momentum

29

due to their ability to indicate and concentrate human pathogenic microorganisms. In the

30

context of the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 epidemic, the objective of this study was

31

to determine if the SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid genome can be detected in zebra mussels

32

(Dreissena polymorpha) exposed to raw and treated urban wastewaters from two separate

33

plants to support its interest as bioindicator of the SARS-CoV-2 genome contamination in

34

water. The zebra mussels were exposed to treated wastewater through caging at the outlet of

35

two plants located in France, as well as to raw wastewater at laboratory scale in controlled

36

conditions. Within their digestive tissues, our results showed that SARS-CoV-2 genome was

37

detected in zebra mussels, whether in raw and treated wastewaters. Moreover, the detection

38

of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in such bivalve molluscans appeared even with low

39

concentrations in raw wastewaters. This is the first detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in

40

the tissues of a sentinel species exposed to raw and treated urban wastewaters. Despite the

41

need for development for quantitative approaches, these results support the importance of

42

such invertebrate organisms, especially zebra mussel, for the active surveillance of pathogenic

43

microorganisms and their indicators in environmental waters.

1. Introduction

65

Since several months, the world has been facing a historic viral pandemic. This pandemic was

66

formalized by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020 and has a known

67

origin in the Wuhan region in China (Langone et al., 2021; WHO, 2020a). Since then, this

68

disease has spread around the world, causing many victims, and disrupting daily life. This

69

pandemic (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus. The Coronaviridae includes

70

seven virus species that infect humans, among them SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which

71

appeared in the 2000s, and therefore SARS-CoV-2, discovered in December 2019 (Lu et al.,

72

2020; Yang et al., 2020). In France, human contaminations were focused on two waves of

73

contamination, from early March 2020 to mid-May 2020 and from mid-October 2020 to the end

74

of 2020.

75

This virus is mainly transmitted by direct contact with an infected person or indirectly via

76

infected droplets (Langone et al., 2021). These droplets are found in the air or on surfaces

77

whose nature greatly varies the lifespan of the virus (Ren et al., 2020). However, since the

78

SARS-COV-2 can infect and replicate both gastrointestinal glandular epithelial cells and

79

respiratory system, the faecal-oral contamination cannot be excluded (Amirian, 2020; Heller et

80

al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020). The occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 genome in the faeces is about

81

43% of COVID-19 patients and can longer be detected in digestive tract than in the respiratory

82

one (Amirian, 2020; Kitajima et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021). This virus can therefore reach

83

wastewater via sewages from cities and hospitals. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 genome has

84

been detected in many raw wastewaters worlwide, especially during intense epidemiological

85

phases (Balboa et al., 2020; Guerrero-Latorre et al., 2020; Kitajima et al., 2020; Nemudryi et

86

al., 2020; Randazzo et al., 2020; Rimoldi et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Wurtzer et al., 2020a).

87

The treatments carried out in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) seem inactivate infectious

88

SARS-CoV-2 since numerous studies attesting to its presence in the raw wastewater no longer

89

observe it after biological treatments performed by some WWTPs (Balboa et al., 2020;

90

Randazzo et al., 2020; Rimoldi et al., 2020; Singer and Wray, 2020). Nevertheless, some

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.28.446136; this version posted June 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

91

studies have detected SARS-CoV-2 genomes in treated wastewaters at wastewater treatment

92

plants in France and Germany (Westhaus et al., 2021; Wurtzer et al., 2020b). This virus can

93

also be detected in rivers in many developing countries, with rudimentary or in the absence of

94

water treatment systems (Guerrero-Latorre et al., 2020), but also in developed countries (Polo

95

et al., 2021; Rimoldi et al., 2020). However, there is still little knowledge concerning the survival

96

of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in this aquatic environment. At a laboratory scale, Desdouits et al.

97

(2021) demonstrated the accumulation of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 genome in different

98

shellfish tissues of oysters (Crassostrea gigas). Wurtzer et al. (2021) have shown the presence

99

of numerous forms of SARS-Cov-2 genomes in wastewaters including a small part of infectious

100

and encapsidated particles using RT-qPCR and infectivity assays. Traces of SARS-CoV-2

101

genome were assessed in digestive tissues of Ruditapes philippinarum and R. decussatus

102

taken from several coastal sites in Spain (Polo et al., 2021).

103

For several years, the use of sentinel species (i.e. bivalve molluscans) of the microbiological

104

contamination of the environmental waters has intensified. The detection for many pathogens

105

in filter-feeding and sessile organisms have many advantages and can complement the direct

106

analyses of water matrices. Bivalve molluscans can indicate bacterial, protozoan or even viral

107

contamination (Bighiu et al., 2019; Capizzi-Banas et al., 2021; Kerambrun et al., 2016; La Rosa

108

et al., 2021). The high filtration capacity of bivalves allows them to filter large volumes of water

109

(Palos Ladeiro et al., 2018; Polo et al., 2021). These invertebrate organisms can therefore be

110

exposed to a panel of contaminants potentially more representative of their environment than

111

that found in a water sample. Indeed, Bighiu et al. (2019) pointed to bacterial indicators 132

112

times higher in zebra mussels than in wastewater. Correlatively, the hepatitis A virus was

113

detected in 16% of bivalve samples (Mytilus galloprovincialis, Solen vagina, Venus gallina, and

114

Donax trunculus) against 9% in all water samples (La Rosa et al., 2021). This has also been

115

demonstrated in zebra mussels for the Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza virus, but to a lesser

116

extent (Stumpf et al., 2010). This filtration capacity is supplemented by an interesting

117

bioaccumulation kinetics since the filter-feeding bivalves rapidly accumulate biological

118

pollutants while being able to keep them several days (or even weeks) after the pressure in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.28.446136; this version posted June 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

119

the environment has disappeared (Bighiu et al., 2019; Capizzi-Banas et al., 2021; Stumpf et

120

al., 2010). This allows to have an integrative approach of water contamination over time. Also,

121

the possibility to perform active biomonitoring through the caging allows a temporal and spatial

122

assessment of the contamination, comparing different geographical sites or hydrosystems

123

(Capizzi-Banas et al., 2021). Among indicator species, the zebra mussel, Dreissena

124

polymorpha, has many advantages for biomonitoring programs under biological pressure

125

(Kraak et al., 1991; Palos Ladeiro et al., 2014). This species is quite resistant to environmental

126

pressures, is easy to handle and can be used in laboratory studies or in the field through the

127

caging technique (Bervoets et al., 2005; Capizzi-Banas et al., 2021; Géba et al., 2020;

128

Kerambrun et al., 2016; Le Guernic et al., 2020; Palos Ladeiro et al., 2018). The digestive

129

tissues of bivalve molluscs is generally used to detect the presence of enteric viruses,

130

especially enteroviruses, since it is the main site of contamination within the bivalve maybe

131

due to specific receptors (Fuentes et al., 2014; Le Guyader et al., 2006; Lees and TAG, 2010;

132

Suffredini et al., 2020). Desdouits et al. (2021) have reported accumulation of inactivated

133

SARS-CoV-2 genome in digestive, mantle and gill tissues of oysters (Crassostrea gigas). This

134

highlighted the potential interest of using digestive tissues of D. polymorpha for detecting

135

SARS-CoV-2 genome in environmental waters.

136

In this context, the objectives of this study were: i) to know if SARS-CoV-2 genomes can be

137

detected in zebra mussels at the inlet and / or at the outlet of two French wastewater treatment

138

plants (WWTPs), namely Reims and center Seine (Ile-de-France public sanitation service,

139

SIAAP), and ii), to determine if this organism can be used as a bioindicator of water

140

contamination by this virus in field and laboratory exposures. These objectives are tested

141

during the two waves of contamination observed in France.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Zebra mussels

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.28.446136; this version posted June 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

145

Zebra mussels (2.98 ± 0.38 g; 2.51 ± 0.19 cm) were collected during October and November

146

of 2019 from Der lake (51290 Giffaumont-Champaubert, France, N 48°33’35”; E 4°45’11”) and

147

brought back to the laboratory, where they were maintained in 1,000 L aerated tanks with 750

148

L of municipal drinking water (13.46 ± 1.77°C; pH 8.15 ± 0.17; 597 ± 27 mS/cm; 0.21 ± 0.05

149

mg/L nitrites; 58.05 ± 13.54 mg/L nitrates; 0.14 ± 0.42 mg/L ammoniac). Mussels were kept

150

several months before the experiments, under these acclimation conditions. Throughout this

151

acclimation step, mussels were fed ad libitum, twice per week, with Nannochloropsis (Nanno

152

3600, Planktovie, Marseille, France).

153
154

2.2. Reims and SIAAP WWTPs

155

The Reims WWTP is located at 16 chemin des Temples, 51370 Saint-Thierry (49°16’49.566”

156

N, 3°59’32.625” E) and is managed by Grand Reims. The center Seine WWTP is located 5

157

Boulevard Louis Seguin, 92700 Colombes (48°55’57.936” N, 2°14’38.58” E) and is managed

158

by the SIAAP. Their characteristics are summarized in Annex 1. Briefly, the two treatment

159

plants have common characteristics, namely physical and chemical treatment of wastewater

160

and sludge, as well as biological treatment of wastewater. The biological treatment of the two

161

WWTPs is mechanical (anaerobic and aeration tanks, biofilters, etc.) and does not include a

162

step with chlorine. At the end of the water treatment process, this water is discharged into the

163

Vesle for the Reims WWTP, and into the Seine for that of the SIAAP.

164
165
166

2.3. Experimental designs
2.3.1. In situ exposures to treated wastewaters

167

Two exposures to effluent were performed on dates corresponding to the two epidemiological

168

waves observed in France. The first one was performed from 07th April 2020 to 07th May 2020,

169

while the second one was performed from 25th September 2020 to 27th November 2020. These

170

cages were deposited into the 1,000 L acclimation tanks. Polyethylene cages, having a volume

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.28.446136; this version posted June 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

171

of 931 cm3, and exhibiting 5 x 5 mm mesh, contained 150 mussels, and were then deposited

172

by two at the study sites. For the site of Reims, cages were placed on the sediment with a

173

water column height of at least 40 cm above them and were connected to the bank with a

174

cable, while for the center Seine site, cages were placed inside the WWTP in a tank receiving

175

treated wastewaters.

176

For the earlier experiment (April and May 2020), mussels were caged at the exit of the Reims

177

WWTP (49°16’39.5” N, 3°59’06.5” E) and inside that of center Seine (48°55’57.936” N,

178

2°14’38.58” E). Caging and sampling kinetics are described in Table 1. The digestive glands

179

of three zebra mussels were grouped together to have enough biological material for the

180

analyses. At each sampling time, ten pools of three digestive glands are recovered for Reims

181

WWTP, and five pools of three digestive glands for SIAAP WWTP. The samples were then

182

directly frozen by liquid nitrogen vapours and then stored at -80°C before the analyses.

183

Concerning the experiment conducted in October and November 2020, mussels were only

184

exposed to the exit of Reims WWTP. As previously described, dissections were performed at

185

laboratory and pools of digestive glands were then stocked at -80°C until RT-qPCR.

186

For each different caging periods, less than 10% mortality was reported.

2.3.2. Laboratory exposures to raw wastewater

191

Four laboratory experiments were performed on dates corresponding to the second

192

epidemiological wave observed in France. The first one was performed from 18th August to

193

22nd August 2020, the second from 02sd September to 05th September 2020, the third exposure

194

was realised from 24th September to 27th September 2020, while the fourth one was performed

195

on one week from 16th November 2020 to 23rd November 2020.

196

The experimental procedure is identical for all four experiments, as described below. Before

197

the experiments, mussels were placed in 10 L aerated glass tanks in the dark with control of

198

the temperature at 13°C. Four tanks containing each 30 D. polymorpha, were implemented: i)

199

with 100% (4 L) of Cristaline Aurele drinking water (spring Jandun, France); ii) 10% of raw

200

wastewater coming from the WWTP of Reims and collected the day before (drinking water q.s.

201

4 L); ii) 33% of raw wastewater (drinking water q.s. 4 L); and iv) 100% of raw wastewater.

202

These waters were changed every day, and the input of raw wastewater came, each

203

experiment day, from a sample the day before. Concerning the first exposure (August 2020),

204

samples were collected on D1, D2, D3 and D4. For both September exposures, samples were

205

collected only on D3, and mussels were not fed during the experimentation step, while

206

concerning the last exposure (November 2020), that lasted longer (sampling time on D1 and

207

D7), mussels were fed every day with Nanno 3600 algae (Planktovie, Marseille, France) before

208

the water change. For this last exposure, two tanks containing 30 zebra mussels were placed

209

for the 100% raw wastewater condition. As previously described, dissections were performed

210

at laboratory and pools of digestive glands were then stocked at -80°C before RT-qPCR

211

analysis. During the exposures carried out at the end of September and in November, mussels

212

in 100% and 33% raw sewage conditions could be dissected respectively before D3 and D7

213

according to their general condition (in particular the time required to close the valves). For

214

these experiments, 15 pools of 3 mussels were dissected before D3 (September) or D7

215

(November) because of the toxicity of untreated wastewater, undiluted or two-thirds diluted.

216
217

2.4. SARS-CoV-2 genome detection in wastewater

218

Analyses of SARS-CoV-2 genome in raw wastewater were realised by the Obepine group

219

(Réseau Obepine, 2021). Briefly, virus particles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation of 11

220

mL of wastewater sample and RNA genome were extracted according to Wurtzer et al.

221

(2020a). SARS-CoV-2 genes RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), E (envelope protein)

222

and N (nucleocapsid protein) were assessed and quantified by RT-qPCR according to Pasteur

223

Institute protocol (WHO, 2020b), Corman et al. (2020) and CDC protocol (U.S. Department of

224

Health and Human Services, 2020) respectively (Table 2). Then these data were synthesized

225

into an indicator obtained by data assimilation with a digital model of the Kalman filter type

226

(Forward-Backward). This graph was constructed only with envelop protein gene. Data for the

227

Reims and center Seine (SIAAP) WWTPs were collected from April 2020 to January 2021, and

228

compared to periods of confinement and curfew observed in France (Réseau Obepine, 2021).

229

This information is available on the Obepine network site (Réseau Obepine, 2021).

230

232

2.5. SARS-COV-2 GENOME detection in digestive tissues of D. polymorpha
2.5.1. RNA quantification

233

After thawing of samples, 200 µL of proteinase K for 200 mg of digestive tissues was added

234

(3 U/ml, Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France). Samples were then homogenized several

235

seconds with an ultra-turrax (Ika-Werk, Janke & Kunkel, Staufen im Breisgau, Germany).

236

Then, cells were lysed by adding trizol reagent and the whole was vortexed (Molecular

237

Research Center Inc., OH, USA). Chloroform (VWR) was added and vortexed 30 seconds with

238

samples and then incubated 15 minutes at room temperature. The aqueous phase containing

239

the nucleic material was recovered after centrifugation (12,000 g, 15 min, 4°C). The following

240

steps of RNA extraction were realised using the PureLinkTM RNA mini kit (Invitrogen,

241

ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, USA) following the manufacturer recommendations, until

242

recovering RNA in RNAse free water. RNA samples were frozen (-20°C) until reverse

243

transcription polymerase chain reaction.

246

SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was based on works of Corman et al. (2020), and performed with

247

SuperScriptTM III one-step RT-PCR with platinumTM Taq (Invitrogen). Genes tested in this

248

article were: RdRP: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene; E, an envelope protein gene and

249

N, nucleocapsid protein gene. Primers and probes used come from the study of Corman et al.

250

(2020), were provided by Eurogentec (Liege, Belgium) and are described below (Table 2Table

251

2). Unlike water samples, the viral load within the digestive gland mash cannot be

252

preconcentrated. Characteristics of RT-qPCR were: 10 min at 55°C (RT) / 3 min at 95°C / 50

253

cycles of 15 sec at 95°C / 30 sec at 58°C (CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR System, BioRad, CA,

254

USA). NTC controls were realised by adding molecular-grade water, positive controls were

255

performed by adding SARS-CoV-2 positive control (COV019 batch number 20033001, Exact

256

Diagnostics, TX, USA) before RT-qPCR, and extraction controls were performed by adding 10

257

µL of this positive standard to digestive gland pools from mussels not exposed (between

258

dissection and freezing). This positive extraction control allowed the obtention of an extraction

259

yield between initial and final concentration of 70% for the E and N genes, and of 28% for the

260

RdRp gene. The positive detections of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the digestive tissues of

261

zebra mussels were validated by a second passage of these samples in reverse transcription

262

polymerase chain reaction.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in raw wastewaters

271

Obepine group has perfomed the wastewater analyses on the two WWTPs studied, and

272

summarized Figure 1A (Réseau Obepine, 2021). Table 3 contains the concentrations of the

273

three targeted SARS-CoV-2 genes in raw wastewaters. These data were averaged over the

274

week for caging exposure to treated wastewater, or over the duration of exposure during

275

laboratory exposures to raw wastewater. The contamination profiles of untreated wastewater

276

by SARS-CoV-2 from Reims and the center Seine WWTPs in 2020 were remarkably similar,

277

and wastewater from both sites exhibited concentrations of comparable values (Table 3).

278

During the first exposures of zebra mussels to treated wastewater (spring), water

279

contamination by the SARS-CoV-2 genome was very high (almost 500,000 copies/L for E

280

gene), but dropped considerably until it reached its lowest values at the end of these exposures

281

(Figure 1A or <DL, Table 3). On the other hand, the exposures to treated wastewater carried

282

out at the end of 2020 corresponded to a period when the index was quite high (between 50

283

and 150, Figure 1). During this second caging exposure, genome concentrations of SARS-

284

CoV-2 in raw water remained stable (between 38,000 and 91,000 copies/L for E gene, Table

285

3). This range of values was also found within exposures carried out in the laboratory after half

286

of September 2020. Indeed, a notable increase in concentrations between the two experiments

287

carried out in September 2020 was observed (Table 3).

3.2. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 genome in digestive tissues of zebra mussels exposed to
treated wastewaters

298

The number of pools of digestive tissues from mussels caged in potentially contaminated

299

wastewater as well as the number of pools with detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome (at least

300

one of the three genes tested) are shown on Figure 1B and on Figure 2A. Table 4 described

301

the detections of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in zebra mussel samples.

302

The first objective of our study was whether the SARS-CoV-2 genome could be detected by

303

the zebra mussel caged at the exit of the WWTP. RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was found in digestive

304

glands of mussels caged at the exit of both center Seine and Reims WWTPs (Table 4, Figure

305

2A). These detections covered, for each season, the entire exposure period (from April 14 to

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.28.446136; this version posted June 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

306

May 07, 2020 during spring caging, and from September 18 to November 20, 2020 during

307

autumn caging, Table 4). Since the concentration values of the various SARS-CoV-2 genes

308

were obtained in raw wastewater, the connection with their detection in caged mussels

309

exposed to treated wastewater must be considered with caution. During the first caging

310

campaign, corresponding to a decreasing phase of the raw wastewater index (Figure 1A), 10%

311

of the exposed mussel pools showed positivity to the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in their digestive

312

tissues (Figure 2A). Surprisingly, when only the results from the center Seine WWTP were

313

considered, this percentage raised to 21%, compared to 5% at the outlet of Reims WWTP. In

314

Reims, the two positive samples were reported in week 16, corresponding to very high

315

concentrations of viral genomes in raw wastewater (464,844 copies of E gene per liter), but

316

also in week 18, during which however the concentrations in the wastewater were below the

317

detection limit (Table 3). For the center Seine WWTP, even with less data, the same

318

observation was made, namely that the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genome in mussels mainly

319

occurred during weeks 18 and 19 when the concentrations found in the raw wastewater were

320

much lower (44,178 and 2,045 copies of E gene per liter respectively, Table 3). The detection

321

of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in digestive tissues of zebra mussels was therefore possible

322

even with small amount present in the aquatic environment, and this detection lasted several

323

days.

324

The second experiment was performed when the concentration of the SARS-CoV-2 genome

325

in raw wastewater increased until a plateau (Figure 1A), and showed 18% of positivity to the

326

virus genome in mussels (only for the Reims WWTP, Figure 2A). Looking more closely,

327

genome positivity for SARS-CoV-2 in mussels was mainly observed during weeks when the

328

concentration in the water was quite high (about 70,000 copies of E gene per liter, weeks 40,

329

45, 47, especially for the E gene, Table 3).

330

Several other studies have assessed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genomes upstream and

331

downstream of WWTPs. Most of them observed presence of the viral genomes in raw

332

wastewater from urban WWTP (Balboa et al., 2020; Randazzo et al., 2020; Rimoldi et al.,

333

2020). All these studies have reported the absence of SARS-CoV-2 genome in treated

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.28.446136; this version posted June 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

334

wastewaters after secondary ± tertiary treatments. Wurtzer et al. (2020b) and Westhaus et al.

335

(2021) have nonetheless detected SARS-CoV-2 genomes after WWTP in France and

336

Germany, respectively. Correlatively, Guerrero-Latorre et al. (2020) and Rimoldi et al. (2020)

337

have reported presence of SARS-CoV-2 genome in rivers not linked to water treatment plant.

338

There are therefore still gray areas as to the fate of this virus within hydrosystems.

339

Among the three genes used to detect SARS-CoV-2 genome, only the envelope (E) and of the

340

nucleocapsid (N) genes were detected in mussels (Table 4). Even with maximum

341

concentration of the samples, no detection of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp)

342

gene was reported, contrary to N gene detected only with the maximum concentration (Table

343

4). The same conclusion can be made with regard to the concentrations of the three SARS-

344

CoV-2 genes in untreated wastewater. In fact, the concentrations for the E gene were

345

approximately 6 times higher than those of the RdRp gene and 2 times higher than those of

346

the N gene (Table 3). These differences may be due to the various PCR efficiencies for these

347

genes but also to the non-homogeneous fragmentation of viral genomes inside our biological

348

matrix (Wurtzer et al., 2021). These discrepancies had already been revealed by other studies,

349

for analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in wastewater or in sludges. Several genes can be

350

targeted by RT-qPCR to study the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, based on the genes

351

of envelope, nucleocapsid, ORF1ab, or even the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Kitajima

352

et al., 2020). However, to date, there is no harmonization of procedures or standardization of

353

the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genome and variations of results according to these assays were

354

reported (Farkas et al., 2020). Corman et al. (2020) reported that the RdRp gene had a lower

355

detection limit than the N and E genes. However, other studies observed different results,

356

synthesized by Nalla et al. (2020). These authors have tested seven RT-qPCR assays linked

357

to SARS-CoV-2 and concluded that N2 set and E gene are the most sensitive (Kitajima et al.,

358

2020; Nalla et al., 2020), while Shirato et al. (2020) reported that only the RT-qPCR assays

359

carried on the nucleocapsid gene worked for them. Rimoldi et al. (2020) evaluated the

360

presence of 3 genes of the SARS-CoV-2 (Orf1ab, N, E) in different aquatic environments

361

(WWTPs and rivers). Only one of the sites showed positivity to the SARS-CoV-2 genome with

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.28.446136; this version posted June 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

362

all 3 genes detected, and this is the only site where the E and N genes were both detected.

363

Desdouits et al. (2021) used Corman’s E set for the envelope gene and IP4 set for RdRp gene,

364

and these two genes were expressed in tissues lysates of Crassostrea gigas after controlled

365

exposure to heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2. In our study, the viral genome positivity of the

366

digestive gland samples was mainly linked to the E gene, and a few of these samples also had

367

positivity via the N gene (Table 4). Despite the lack of harmonization on the methods used, it

368

would have been interesting to use other specific genes of SARS-CoV-2 (Orf1ab, RdRp IP4

369

set, other regions of N or E genes, etc.) to potentially improve its detection within digestive

370

glands of zebra mussels.

371

Few studies had reported detection of SARS-CoV-2 genome in treated wastewaters. In our

372

study, detection of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in the digestive glands of zebra mussels exposed

373

at the WWTP outlet was observed. The use of a filter feeder and sessile species could explain

374

this difference. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes directly in wastewater was often

375

represented by a value at a time point as well as on a volume of water which is not fully

376

representative of the water mass. Correlatively, zebra mussels, because of their sessility and

377

their filtration capacity, allow a more extensive characterization of the pollution of their

378

environment (Kraak et al., 1991; Palos Ladeiro et al., 2014). In fact, these organisms can

379

bioaccumulate biological and chemical pollutants for several days or even weeks, allowing

380

pollution to be monitored over time, and filter a significant volume of water that is better

381

representative of the mass of water (Bervoets et al., 2005; Palos Ladeiro et al., 2018; Wiesner

382

et al., 2001). Concerning the SARS-CoV-2 genome, oysters have already proven their

383

effectiveness by accumulating this virus during laboratory exposures (Desdouits et al., 2021).

384

Also in the marine environment, the Ruditapes genus had shown its efficiency in accumulating

385

the SARS-CoV-2 genome in their digestive tissues (Polo et al., 2021). The authors of this study

386

concluded that mollusc bivalves can be used as biomonitoring tools for various anthropogenic

387

contaminants, including the SARS-CoV-2 virus. During our study, zebra mussels were useful

388

to detect SARS-CoV-2 genome in both untreated and treated wastewaters, even if the

389

concentrations in wastewater was under the detection limit (1,000 copies/L). All these

390

characteristics make such bivalve, and particularly zebra mussels, good indicators for the

391

detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomes in such environments. These organisms can potentially

392

support or even improve the sensitivity of the direct detection of the viral genome in water

393

samples.

406
407

To further support the use of this sentinel species as an indicator of the presence of the SARS-

408

CoV-2 genome in environmental waters, improvements on the extraction and detection of the

409

SARS-CoV-2 genome in the digestive tissues of zebra mussels are required. Indeed, to

410

improve detection of SARS-CoV-2 genome inside this complex biological matrix, the PCR

411

cycle number has been increased to 50. Of the total positive detection data on E gene (Table

412

4), 73% had Cq lower than 42.75, but a few were higher (all Cq were comprised between 35.64

413

to 46.32). These high values underlined the limits of detection or extraction of this viral genetic

414

material, and particularly in the biological matrix used here. Contrary to the quantification of

415

SARS-CoV-2 genome in water, a pre-concentration step to concentrate the viral genome

416

before analyses is not necessary (Kitajima et al., 2020). Moreover, the number of digestive

417

glands per pool was not elevated (3). Several modifications can be considered to improve the

418

viral extraction, such an addition of a purification step to limit as much as possible the

419

enzymatic inhibitors which could be found in the biological matrix, preventing the good

420

progress of the detection. In parallel, new experiments could be performed to improve the

421

sensitivity of the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genome in mussels but also to characterize the

422

bioaccumulation pattern in the tissues of D. polymorpha. These experiments must be

423

performed in the laboratory in controlled conditions, to observe (or not) a dose-dependent

424

accumulation relationship, and using untreated wastewater with higher levels of SARS-CoV-2

425

genomes than in treated water.

3.3. Zebra mussels as biological indicators of water contamination by the SARS-CoV-2
genome

438

The second aim of this study was to assess the interest of using zebra mussels as bioindicator

439

of water contamination by the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Controlled laboratory exposures were

440

therefore put in place to address the questions raised during exposure to treated wastewater.

441

Also, to maintain the natural contamination by SARS-CoV-2 in the receiving aquatic

442

environment, mussels were exposed to raw wastewater from Reims WWTP.

443

Regarding the experiments performed at a laboratory scale, the genome detection of SARS-

444

CoV-2 genome was higher when the mussels were directly submitted to raw wastewater

445

(100%) compared to the diluted wastewaters (33 or 10%, Figure 2C). Indeed, the most

446

concentrated condition (100% raw wastewater) resulted in a positivity of 28% of the samples

447

(10/32), greater than 15% (4/27) and 13% (4/31), caused respectively by conditions 33% and

448

10% of raw wastewater ratios. Zebra mussels were therefore useful to detect the SARS-CoV-

449

2 genome in accordance with its presence in wastewaters. Furthermore, there was a similarity

450

between the growing phase of the COVID-19 pandemic after summer 2020, confirmed by an

451

increase of the raw wastewater index between July and October (Figure 1A), and the detection

452

of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in mussels (Figure 2B). Indeed, when exposed to raw

453

wastewaters in August, none of the 15 pools of exposed mussel digestive gland had the

454

genome of this virus, and this number increased with time. During the first exposure in early

455

September 2020, 7% (1/15) of the pools exhibited positivity for the SARS-CoV-2 genome, to

456

increase to 38% (5/13) at the end of September, almost identical to the values found in

457

November (33%, 12/36, Figure 2B). This result was in accordance with the sudden increase in

458

the concentration of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in raw wastewater between early and late

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.28.446136; this version posted June 1, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

459

September (Table 3). This increase was all the more important for the E gene and also

460

continued after September. For illustration, the concentrations of these genes in the raw

461

wastewater were lower than those of the 33% diluted wastewater (Table 3). This originally

462

suggested that the zebra mussel can be used as indicator of the SARS-CoV-2 genome

463

detection in proportion to the contamination load present in freshwater environment and

464

contributes to emphasis the uses of zebra mussels as sentinel species for SARS-CoV-2

465

contamination of wastewaters. Desdouits et al. (2021) and Polo et al. (2021) demonstrated the

466

accumulation of anthropogenic virus by bivalves in several coastal sites including SARS-CoV-

467

2 virus within digestive tissue. Contrary to Polo et al. (2021), Desdouits et al. (2021) but did

468

not report the presence of SARS-CoV-2 genome in the field (in water or in bivalve molluscans).

469

Nonetheless, even if the laboratory experiments allowed to expose zebra mussels to higher

470

SARS-CoV-2 genome contamination, the experimental plan used in our study (short exposure

471

due to the possible toxicity of raw wastewaters) only allowed the qualitative detection of the

472

presence of SARS-CoV-2 genome in organisms but did not allow the genome quantification.

473

Indeed, the possible toxicity of raw wastewater, causing an advanced dissection of organisms

474

exposed to the most concentrated raw sewage conditions (18% of samples during the

475

exposure at the end of September and 26% of samples during the last exposure, in November),

476

did not allow mussels to be exposed any longer. To dispense with the toxicity of raw

477

wastewater, a longer exposure of the mussels (from 14 to 21 days) in the laboratory to a non-

478

infectious SARS-CoV-2 or to low pathogenic CoV strains could improve characterization of

479

virus accumulation within mussels (Desdouits et al., 2021; Wurtzer et al., 2020b).

480

Thanks to our results, the use of this bivalve as a bioindicator and possible matrix to follow the

481

presence of SARS-CoV-2 genome in water is conceivable, whether at the level of treatment

482

plants, but also at the level of freshwater (rivers, etc.) or in countries whose water treatment

483

structures are still underdeveloped. As announced by several recent studies, the bivalve taxon

484

represents a complementarity, even a more than plausible alternative for the detection of

485

viruses in the environment (Capizzi-Banas et al., 2021; Desdouits et al., 2021; La Rosa et al.,

486

487

environmental biomonitoring for health purposes.

4. Conclusion

495

Out of a total of 666 mussels exposed to water potentially contaminated by the SARS-CoV-2

496

genome, i.e. 222 pools of digestive glands, 33 pools showed positivity to the genome of this

497

virus, representing almost 7%. This detection was observed during the two major

498

epidemiological phases in France and both with raw wastewater and treated wastewater.

499

Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 genomes was detected in D. polymorpha as well at the outlet of the

500

Reims wastewater treatment plant as that of center Seine one. This corroborated the results

501

in untreated wastewater but also brought a novelty with the resilience of the genetic material

502

of the virus after treatment of these waters. This detection is proportional to the contamination

503

in the wastewaters and can allow a temporal and spatial monitoring. The zebra mussel

504

therefore appears to be an attractive candidate for detecting the presence of the SARS-CoV-

505

2 genome in raw and treated wastewaters, but also in other hydrosystems. The detection of

506

the genome of other enteric viruses could be relevant using this sentinel species.
