Abstract:
Some patients infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) develop
severe pneumonia and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1]. Distinct clinical features in
these patients have led to speculation that the immune response to virus in the SARS-CoV-2-infected
alveolus differs from other types of pneumonia [2]. We collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from
86 patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced respiratory failure and 252 patients with known or suspected
pneumonia from other pathogens and subjected them to flow cytometry and bulk transcriptomic profiling.
We performed single cell RNA-Seq in 5 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples collected from patients with
severe COVID-19 within 48 hours of intubation. In the majority of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection at
the onset of mechanical ventilation, the alveolar space is persistently enriched in alveolar macrophages and
T cells without neutrophilia. Bulk and single cell transcriptomic profiling suggest SARS-CoV-2 infects
alveolar macrophages that respond by recruiting T cells. These T cells release interferon-gamma to induce
inflammatory cytokine release from alveolar macrophages and further promote T cell recruitment. Our
results suggest SARS-CoV-2 causes a slowly unfolding, spatially-limited alveolitis in which alveolar
macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 transcripts and T cells form a positive feedback loop that drives
progressive alveolar inflammation.

Introduction:
Most patients infected by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) suffer no or
only mild symptoms. A small minority of patients develop severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),
and these patients account for almost all of the morbidity and mortality associated with the infection [1].
Reported rates of mortality in patients with severe disease range between 20–40% [3–5]. The relatively
high mortality among patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia reported in some centers, combined
with a systemic inflammatory response that is severe in some patients, have led to speculation that the
pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is distinct from other respiratory viral and bacterial pathogens [2].
We obtained bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from 86 patients with respiratory failure secondary to
severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and compared them with BAL specimens from 252 patients with
pneumonia secondary to other pathogens and intubated patients without pneumonia that were
prospectively collected before and during the pandemic. For many patients we were able to obtain samples
within 48 hours of intubation and sequentially over the course of the illness, allowing us to gain insights
about the early pathogenesis of COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We
profiled BAL samples using multicolor flow cytometry to identify CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, monocytes,
mature and immature alveolar macrophages, and neutrophils. We also performed bulk transcriptomic
profiling of flow cytometry-sorted alveolar macrophages in a subset of patients with confirmed COVID-19.
Additionally, we performed single cell RNA-Seq on BAL fluid collected less than 48 hours after intubation
from 5 patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.
Our results suggest that, unlike other respiratory pathogens such as influenza viruses and bacteria, the
alveolar space of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients is populated by alveolar macrophages and T cells without
neutrophilia. We also detected positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 viral transcripts in alveolar macrophages
in the absence of ACE2 expression, suggestive of active viral replication in alveolar macrophages. Alveolar
macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 transcripts are activated and express IL1B, a master regulator of
inflammation, and several chemokines known to drive recruitment of T cells. These same alveolar
macrophages show an enhanced response to interferon-gamma (IFNγ) generated by T cells. Our results
suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a slowly progressing and spatially limited alveolitis, in which
alveolar macrophages harboring SARS-CoV-2 and IFNγ-producing T cells form self-sustaining circuits that
drive alveolar inflammation. We further suggest that alveolar macrophages may be a nonspecific reservoir
for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, acting as a Trojan horse to enable immune evasion and viral dissemination
throughout the lung.

Results:
Demographics: Samples were collected from patients enrolled in the Successful Clinical Response in
Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) systems biology center, a NIAID-funded observational study of patients with
severe pneumonia, defined as those requiring mechanical ventilation. From March 13 to June 15, 2020, we
prospectively enrolled 86 of the 256 patients with SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia and respiratory failure
requiring mechanical ventilation in our ICU at Northwestern Medicine, Chicago (Figure S1a, b; Table 1).
We obtained sequential samples in the majority of patients (Figure 1a). We compared these patients with
252 mechanically ventilated patients with known or clinically-suspected pneumonia enrolled in the two
years before and during the pandemic. Five critical care physicians (RGW, JMK, BDS, COP, JMW)
retrospectively adjudicated patients as COVID-19 pneumonia, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, pneumonia

secondary to other pathogens or non-pneumonia controls (intubated for reasons other than pneumonia)
according to a standardized adjudication procedure (see Methods). Patients were designated as viral
pneumonia if a multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses obtained by nasopharyngeal swab or BAL was
positive in the absence of an alternative diagnosis based on quantitative culture of BAL fluid or multiplex
PCR. A complete list of viral and bacterial pathogens identified as the cause of pneumonia is in Table 2.
For some patients without COVID-19 the diagnosis of pneumonia was made based on clinical suspicion,
radiographic findings and response to antimicrobial therapy in the absence of an identified pathogen. For
all patients with COVID-19, samples were collected from regions of greatest chest radiograph abnormality
by a critical care physician using a disposable bronchoscope. The majority of samples prior to the pandemic
were collected by respiratory therapists using non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (NBBAL) with the
catheter directed to the most radiographically affected lung [6].
Compared with patients with known or suspected pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation, patients
with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were similar in age, race, and sex, but had a significantly higher body
mass index and a lower proportion of patients were current smokers, compared with historic control
populations diagnosed with other viral pneumonias, non-viral pneumonia, or non-pneumonia control
patients (Figure 1b-g). Patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia required longer periods of ventilation
and had longer lengths of stay in the ICU compared with all pneumonia and non-pneumonia controls
(Figure 1h-i). Severity of illness estimated using the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score
and the acute physiology score (APS) was similar in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia compared with
other pneumonia and was comparable to that observed in a recent study of ARDS [7] (Supplemental
Figure S1c and Table 1). Nevertheless, mortality was significantly lower (q = 0.046, Chi-Square tests of
proportions) in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, compared with the entire cohort (22% vs 35%), but
was not significantly different as compared with any individual comparison group (Figure 1j).

Figure 1. Demographics of the SCRIPT cohort. We compared BAL fluid obtained sequentially from 86 patients
with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation with 39 patients with confirmed pneumonia
secondary to other respiratory viruses (other viral pneumonia) and 159 patients with non-viral pneumonia (other
pneumonia) and 41 mechanically ventilated patients without pneumonia undergoing BAL (non-pneumonia controls).

day of the first intubation. An average of 1.63 (range 1–9) BAL samples were collected per patient. b. Distribution of
patient ages. Differences not significant by pairwise t-test with FDR correction. c. Sex. Proportions of females (red)
and males (blue) were similar between groups (pairwise Chi-Square tests of proportions with continuity and FDR
correction). d. Self-reported race. Proportions were similar between groups (pairwise Chi-Square tests of proportions
with continuity and FDR correction). e. Self-reported ethnicity. A significant increase in the proportion of individuals
identifying as Hispanic or Latino was observed in the COVID-19 cohort, relative to all controls (q < 0.05, pairwise ChiSquare tests of proportions with continuity and FDR correction). f. Self-reported smoking status. Significantly fewer
active smokers were observed in the COVID-19 cohort, as compared with all control groups (q < 0.05, pairwise ChiSquare tests of proportions with continuity and FDR correction). g. Body mass index (BMI). BMI was elevated in the
COVID-19 cohort relative to patients with viral pneumonia, and other pneumonia, but not to non-pneumonia controls
(q < 0.05, t-test with FDR correction). h. ICU length of stay. ICU length of stay was longer in the COVID-19 cohort,
relative to all control cohorts (pairwise t-tests with FDR correction). i. Duration of mechanical ventilation. The
duration of mechanical ventilation was significantly increased in the COVID-19 cohort relative only to non-pneumonia
controls (pairwise t-tests with FDR correction). j. Mortality in patients with COVID-19 was similar to patients with
other respiratory viruses, non-viral pneumonia and non-pneumonia controls. Differences are not significant (q > 0.05)
unless otherwise noted.

samples were cryopreserved and sorted post-cryorecovery. Since cryopreservation affects the number of granulocytes,
these samples were not included in flow cytometric analysis, but were used for bulk RNA-seq profiling of flow-sorted
alveolar macrophages. Skipped analyses are represented by alluvia flowing over the grouping bars. b. Sankey diagram

The BAL fluid from patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is dominated by T cells. To define the
immune cell profile over the course of severe SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia, we analyzed 116 samples
from 61 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in our cohort. We compared those samples with 228 samples
from 179 patients with severe pneumonia secondary to other causes. We used multicolor flow cytometry
with a panel of markers sufficient to identify neutrophils, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, macrophages and
monocytes in the BAL fluid (Figure S2a,b) [6,8]. We first focused analysis on patients who had a sample
collected within 48 hours of intubation, comparing 29 samples from 28 patients with confirmed COVID-19
to 89 samples from 85 patients with severe pneumonia secondary to other causes. We found that, despite a
diagnosis of severe ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation, only 34.4% of patients with severe COVID-19
exhibited neutrophilia in BAL fluid within 48 hours of intubation, defined as a neutrophil frequency over
50% (Figure 2a–c). Instead, we found that in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, the alveolar
space was significantly enriched for both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and monocytes (Figure 2a,b). This
observation significantly differs from patients with pneumonia secondary to other respiratory viruses,
bacteria or mechanically ventilated non-pneumonia controls [8]. This pattern was not due to the differences
in co-infections between different types of pneumonia (Figure 2d). Collectively, these findings suggest that
unusual factors related to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia result in the recruitment of T cells and monocytes,
rather than neutrophils, to the infected alveolus.

Transcriptomic analysis of flow-sorted alveolar macrophages identifies an interferon response
signature as a unique feature of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. We performed RNA-Seq on flow-sorted
alveolar macrophages from patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia (82 samples from 51 patients)
and compared them with patients with pneumonia secondary to other causes (29 samples from 23 patients
with any other viral pneumonia, 103 samples from 84 patients with non-viral pneumonia), non-pneumonia
controls (24 samples from 23 patients) and healthy volunteers (5 samples from 5 volunteers). k-means
clustering of the 2,149 most variable genes across diagnoses using a likelihood-ratio test (LRT) identified 5
clusters (Figure 3a, Supplemental Figure 3a, Supplemental Data Files 1–3). Notably, patients with
COVID-19 clustered together. Cluster 1 contained genes specifically upregulated in patients with COVID19, relative to patients with other pneumonia and non-pneumonia controls and was characterized by genes
involved in the response to interferon (IFN) (GO:0060333 interferon-gamma-mediated signaling pathway;
GO:0002474 antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen via MHC class I; GO:0051607 defense
response to virus). Cluster 1 included genes encoding the chemokine CCL8, which drives T cell recruitment
via CCR5, and CCL24, a highly specific T cell chemoattractant (Figure 3a and Supplemental Figure
3b). Cluster 2 genes were upregulated in patients with early COVID-19 and patients with other pneumonia,
but not in non-pneumonia controls and other viral pneumonia. Cluster 2 was characterized by expression
of genes associated with monocyte-derived macrophages, such as CCR2, CCL2, FCN1, F13A1, RNASE1,

GO:0042116 macrophage activation; GO:0006955 immune response). Cluster 3 was characterized by
expression of genes involved in monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, including transcription factors
NR4A1 and BHLHE40, CSF2RA encoding a subunit of GM-CSF receptor, essential molecular chaperones
(BAG3, DNAJB1, HSPA1B, HSPA1A), and multiple cytokines and chemokines (CCL20, IL1A, IL1B, AREG,
VEGFA, CXCR4, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL1, CXCL8; GO:0002548 monocyte chemotaxis; GO:0002449
lymphocyte mediated immunity; GO:0032611 interleukin-1 beta production). This cluster was also
characterized by unfolded protein response activation resulting from hypoxia, including HIF1, LAMP3, and
DDIT4 (GO:0001666 response to hypoxia). Cluster 3 was enriched for patients with non-viral pneumonia.
Genes characterizing cluster 4 were not upregulated in patients with COVID-19 or in healthy controls and
included CD164, MFGE8, IL13RA1, and FCGR2A, suggesting presence of maturing monocyte-derived
macrophages. Cluster 5 expressed FABP4, MSR1, AXL, C1QA, ALOX5, MARCO and other genes typical
for homeostatic resident alveolar macrophages (GO:0006629 lipid metabolic process; GO:0006909
phagocytosis; GO:0043277 apoptotic cell clearance). Interestingly, IL6, the protein product of which has
been implicated in cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 and serves as a predictor of morbidity and mortality
in severe COVID-19 [9], was not among differentially expressed genes and its overall expression was not
different between the groups with the exception of healthy controls, where IL6 transcripts were never
detected (Supplemental Figure 3b).
We then asked whether we can detect SARS-CoV-2 transcripts in flow-sorted alveolar macrophages and
whether the presence of viral transcripts correlates with specific changes in alveolar macrophage
transcriptomes. To allow detection of viral RNA, we aligned sequences to a hybrid genome including human,
SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A/California/07/2009 reference genomes. An additional negative strand
transcript, which is transiently formed during viral replication, was added to the SARS-CoV-2
transcriptome to detect replicating virus [10]. We queried macrophage transcriptomes from all patients for
the presence of positive- and negative-strand transcripts encoding SARS-CoV-2. We detected SARS-CoV-2
transcripts in macrophage transcriptomes from 67% of patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In 38% of these patients, we detected both positive- and negative-strand SARS-CoV-2 transcripts (Figure
3b, Supplemental Figure 3c). As would be expected during recovery, we also observed a significant

negative correlation between abundance of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts in patients with confirmed COVID-19
and days of ventilation (ρ = -0.45, Spearman correlation; Supplemental Figure 3d).
In order to identify more specific macrophage gene modules, particularly those that distinguish pneumonia
type and outcome, we performed weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) (Figure 3c,
Supplemental Data File 1). As predicted, we identified some modules related to composition of the bulk
samples, correlating strongly with flow cytometry results. Module 4 exhibited a strong association with the
percentage of CD206hi alveolar macrophages, and was characterized by genes expressed in mature tissueresident alveolar macrophages, including FABP4 and PPARG (R = 0.53) [11]. Module 12 exhibited a strong
negative correlation with percentage of CD206hi macrophages, and was identified by expression of genes
found in immature monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages including SPP1 (R = -0.59).
Strikingly, module 14 correlated with the detection of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts, levels of C-reactive protein,
CD8+ T cell abundance, and COVID-19 diagnosis (R = 0.30, 0.29, 0.27, 0.26, respectively). Notably, all
SARS-CoV-2 genes included in this analysis were assigned to this module, further underscoring disease
relevance. In confirmation of the k-means clustering results, this module was highly enriched for type I and
type II interferon response genes (GO:0060337 type I interferon signaling pathway; GO:0060333 interferongamma-mediated signaling pathway). This association was further confirmed by UMAP projection of all
bulk RNA-seq samples, which separated largely by diagnosis with module 14 as a major driver of clustering
(Figure 3d). Significant negative correlations of average module 14 expression, type I interferon signaling
(GO:0060337), and type II interferon signaling (GO:0060333) were observed over the time-course of
mechanical ventilation, suggesting reductions during the recovery phase (Figure 3e–g).

Single cell RNA-Seq identifies a positive feedback loop between IFNγ-producing T cells and
SARS-CoV-2-infected alveolar macrophages. RNA-Seq analysis of flow-sorted alveolar macrophages
suggested that at the time of intubation in patients with severe COVID-19, tissue-resident alveolar
macrophages (TRAMs) have been replaced with recruited monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages (MoAM)
characterized by an IFN-response signature. To gain insights about early events preceding the onset of
COVID-19 respiratory failure we performed single cell RNA-Seq on 5 patients from whom BAL samples
were collected within 48 hours of intubation and in which flow cytometry identified distinct populations of
CD206hi and CD206lo macrophages. A single patient with bacterial pneumonia was used as a control.
Samples were enriched via flow sorting for live cells excluding granulocytes.
Analysis of the integrated COVID-19 dataset resolved clusters corresponding to macrophages, subsets of
dendritic cells, epithelial cells (ionocytes, club, ciliated and alveolar epithelial type 1 and type 2 cells),
subsets of T cells, B cells and plasma cells (Figure 4a, Supplemental Data File 4). Macrophages
contained 5 clusters: three subclusters of monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages (all characterized by
CCL2 expression) with different degrees of maturation (MoAM1, CCL2+IL1R2+CCL8+MRC1-FABP4-;
MoAM2, CCL2+CCL18+MRC1+FABP4-; MoAM3, CCL2+MCEMP1+MRC1+FABP4-), and two subclusters
of resident alveolar macrophages – TRAM1 and TRAM2 both expressing typical TRAM marker genes
(FABP4, RBP4, INHBA) (Figure 4b). All macrophage clusters were represented by cells from 4–5 patients
(Supplemental Figure S4a).
As our analysis of transcriptomic data from alveolar macrophages suggested that SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia
is uniquely associated with the activation of pathways induced by interferons, we looked for the expression
of type I interferons in our single cell dataset. We did not detect type I interferon expression in any of the
sequenced cells (data not shown). Similarly, we did not detect type I interferon transcripts in other publicly
available single cell RNA-Seq datasets obtained from BAL fluid [12,13]. In contrast, expression of type II
interferon – IFNG – was detected in T cells from all 5 patients (Figure 4c, Supplemental Figure 4b).
These results suggest the interferon response gene signature we observed in flow-sorted alveolar
macrophages is induced by IFNγ released from activated T cells.
We next looked for SARS-CoV-2 positive- and negative-strand transcripts within our data. As expected,
both were detected in epithelial cells and migratory CCR7+ dendritic cells. Interestingly, they were also
detected in MoAM1 and TRAM2 subclusters (Figure 4d, Supplemental Figure 4c). Coronaviruses
generate large numbers of positive strand transcripts from a single negative strand transcript [10,14].
Consistent with this known biology, we detected more transcripts for positive compared with negative
strands in both our single cell and bulk RNA-Seq data Supplementary Figure 4d). These data suggest
that alveolar macrophages harbor virus and suggest they may support viral replication as has been reported
for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [15–17].
Interestingly, TRAM2 harboring SARS-CoV-2 showed distinct clustering compared with uninfected TRAM1
(clustering was performed without SARS-CoV-2 transcripts). Importantly, these TRAM2 also clustered
differently when compared with TRAM from a patient with bacterial pneumonia (Supplemental Figure
4e, f, Supplemental Data File 5). Marker genes distinguishing infected TRAM2 from non-infected
TRAM1 included several chemokines and cytokines important for T cell recruitment. These include CCL20,
which attracts dendritic cells and T cells via CCR6 and only weakly attracts neutrophils (Figure 4b, e),
CXCL10 and CXCL11, which attract T cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells via CXCR3, and CCL4, which
attracts monocytes, NK and T cells via CCR5 (Figure 4b, f). These cells also expressed genes important in

the innate immune response to virus. These include IL1B (Figure 4b, g), TNFSF10, a member of TNF
ligand family, and the antimicrobial peptide defensin B (DEFB1) (Figure 4b, Supplemental Data File
6). Finally, these cells were marked by increased expression of interferon response genes (ISG15, IFIT1,
IFIT2, IFIT3, MX1 and others). Consistent with this observation, we found higher average levels of
expression of a curated list of IFN-response genes in infected (TRAM2) compared with non-infected
(TRAM1) alveolar macrophages (Figure 4b,h; Supplemental Figure 4g). These results indicate a
positive feedback loop in which SARS-CoV-2-infected alveolar macrophages release chemokines that recruit
T cells, which release IFNγ to further activate the infected alveolar macrophages.
High serum levels of IL-6 and its transcriptional target C-reactive protein have been observed in patients
with severe COVID-19. IL-6 induces the transcription of clotting factors in the liver and tissue factor in the
endothelium that promote thrombosis [18]. These mechanisms are thought to contribute to the
microvascular thrombosis in the lung and other tissues observed in autopsy studies conducted on patients
with COVID-19, which in turn is thought to contribute to multiple organ dysfunction [19,20]. As increased
transcripts encoding IL-6 have not been observed in single cell RNA-Seq studies of the peripheral blood
[21], some have suggested IL-6 is generated by inflammatory cells in the alveolus [20]. The overall
expression of IL6 was low, and was not restricted to a specific cell type in our single cell RNA-Seq dataset.
Despite this, the levels of C-reactive protein at the time of intubation were increased in patients with severe
COVID-19, relative to the upper limit of the normal range of 10 mg/L (P = 2.5x10-3, one-sample Wilcoxon
rank-sum test; Supplemental Figure S1c). These results suggest that the resident and recruited immune
cells in the infected alveoli do not directly contribute to systemic increase of IL-6 (Supplemental Figure
S4h).

Severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia unfolds slowly over time. Our studies of BAL fluid collected from
patients with COVID-19 within 48 hours of intubation revealed an already established feedback loop
between activated T cells and infected alveolar macrophages. This stable, slowly amplifying feedback loop
is consistent with the long duration between symptom onset and the development of respiratory failure in
patients with COVID-19 (5–9 days) and the prolonged course of mechanical ventilation in many of these
patients (Figure 1a, h, i) [1]. A prediction from this model is that these circuits will persist over time until
the virus is cleared. Hence, we examined serial BAL fluid samples collected from patients with severe
SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia over time (Figure 5a, b). We used clinical measures performed on the BAL fluid
(quantitative culture or multiplex PCR for respiratory pathogens) to identify bacterial superinfections,
defined as detection of a new bacterial pathogen acquired during the hospitalization. In the absence of a
detected bacterial superinfection, BAL fluid remained non-neutrophilic in 62% of samples from patients
admitted with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. BAL neutrophilia developed in 50% of patients with COVID-19
who developed bacterial superinfection. Hierarchical clustering of the composition of BAL samples from all
time points demonstrated that in comparison to samples from other types of pneumonia samples from
patients with COVID-19 were enriched for T cells irrespective of the time of BAL collection (Figure 5a, b)
or presence or absence of superinfection (Figure 5c).
Our data suggest that composition of immune cells in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is relatively stable and
continues to unfold slowly over time, resulting in a loss of tissue-resident alveolar macrophages and
continuous recruitment of monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages. To test this hypothesis, we performed
cell type deconvolution to estimate the proportion of individual cell types in bulk RNA-seq data from flowsorted alveolar macrophages using cell type-specific signatures from single cell RNA-seq. This approach
confirmed that only a small portion of the samples from patients with pneumonia contained tissue-resident
alveolar macrophages. Instead, the majority of alveolar macrophages were mature monocyte-derived
alveolar macrophages (MoAM3) (Figure 5d, Supplemental Figure 4i). Interestingly, samples from
patients with COVID-19 contained more immature MoAM2 alveolar macrophages than samples from
patients with other types of pneumonia, supporting our hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is
characterized by the ongoing recruitment of monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages.

1. Normal alveolus contains ACE2-expressing alveolar type 1 and type 2 cells (AT1 and AT2, correspondingly) and
tissue-resident alveolar macrophages (TRAM). 2. SARS-CoV-2 infects AT2 cells and TRAM. Infected TRAM are
activated and express IL1B and T cell chemokines. 3. Cross-reactive or de novo generated T cells recognize SARSCoV-2 antigens presented by TRAM and produce IFNγ, further activating TRAM to produce cytokines and
chemokines. 4. Activated T cells proliferate and continue to produce IFNγ, eventually leading to death of infected
TRAM and recruitment of monocytes, which rapidly differentiate into monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages
(MoAM). MoAM in turn produce chemokines that further promote T cell and monocyte recruitment, thus sustaining
pneumonia. 5. Recruited MoAM either become mature and repopulate alveoli or become infected with SARS-CoV-2,
continuing to present antigens to T cells and maintain the feedback loop.

Discussion:
Our data represent the earliest sampling of the alveolar space of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia
reported to date [12,22]. It is possible to use these data to speculate about early events that lead to
pneumonia in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 5e). Strong evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2
initially infects and replicates in epithelial cells in the nasopharynx, which express relatively high levels of
ACE2 in comparison with epithelial cells in airways or the distal lung [23,24]. There the virus replicates
and escapes clearance by suppressing type I interferon responses [25–27] and broadly disrupting protein
translation [28]. Whether by progressive movement distally in the tracheobronchial tree or via aspiration
of nasopharyngeal contents, some virus gains access to the distal alveolar space. In the alveolar space, we
confirm that SARS-CoV-2 infects alveolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages [27]. Alveolar
macrophages might be infected with SARS-CoV-2 by 1) phagocytosis of infected epithelial cells, 2) via direct
infection, as was shown for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [15,16] or 3) through other mechanisms, such as
antibody mediated enhancement as was shown for SARS-CoV [17,29]. Indeed, it is estimated that ~90% of
adults have antibodies against one of four major seasonal coronaviruses [30], and antibodies cross-reacting
with SARS-CoV-2 might facilitate viral entry into alveolar macrophages.
While tissue-resident alveolar macrophages are poor antigen-presenting cells and do not migrate to lymph
nodes to participate in conversion of naive T cells into effector T cells [31], a low level of antigen presentation
by alveolar macrophages in the alveolar space might be sufficient to drive activation of pre-existing memory
T cells that target endemic seasonal coronaviruses, but cross-react with SARS-CoV-2. Existence of such
cross-reactive memory T cells has been reported for SARS-CoV [32] and, recently, SARS-CoV-2 [33–36].
This mechanism might explain the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, which disproportionately affects elderly
individuals, while children and young adults often have only mild symptoms, despite having viral load in
upper airways compatible to adults [37,38]. Children and young individuals have fewer encounters with
seasonal coronaviruses during their lifetime than elderly individuals and therefore would have fewer crossreactive antibodies or memory T cells.
We did not detect substantial expression of type I interferons in our datasets. This could be either related
to the timing of sampling, undersampling cell types producing type I interferons, or inhibition of type I
interferon production by SARS-CoV-2 proteins [25,39]. However, we readily detected IFNγ production by T
cells. This supports a model where infection and activation of tissue-resident alveolar macrophages with
SARS-CoV-2, followed by antigen presentation to cross-reactive or SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells, leads to a
delayed interferon response. This in turn amplifies the inflammatory response by recruiting
proinflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages, as has been suggested from animal models of SARS-CoV
infection [40]. Interestingly, in agreement with our observation that the inflammatory environment in the
lung during severe COVID-19 is characterized by the paucity of neutrophils, we found that alveolar
macrophages produced chemokines preferentially driving recruitment of T cells and monocytes, but not
neutrophils.
Our results also explain the slow progression of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia relative to other respiratory
viruses, most notably influenza A. Specifically, the time from the onset of symptoms to respiratory failure
in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is 5–9 days, compared with 1–3 days or even less in patients with
influenza A infection[4]. Consistent with a slower course, the duration of illness is longer in patients with
severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. While both viruses might gain access to the distal lung by similar
mechanisms, the sialic acid residues that serve as receptors for influenza A are abundantly expressed in

alveolar type 2 cells [23]. In contrast, single cell RNA-Seq atlases of the human lung and sm-FISH studies
of the normal lung show that only a small number of alveolar epithelial cells express ACE2 [23,24]. Thus,
while influenza A would infect large numbers of cells causing widespread injury, rapid viral replication and
robust antiviral responses, infection by SARS-CoV-2 is likely to lead to more localized areas of infection.
These more localized areas of infection and injury are consistent with radiographic patterns of early
COVID-19, and the presence of discrete radiographic abnormalities in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients
[41]. Because tissue-resident alveolar macrophages have limited motility [42], the uptake and persistence
of SARS-CoV-2-infected alveolar macrophages would not be predicted to spread the virus to adjacent lung
regions. However, recruited monocyte-derived alveolar macrophages, which we found can also harbor
replicating SARS-CoV-2, are typically more numerous, and could conceivably spread the virus to adjacent
alveoli. In each new area of infection, positive feedback loops between alveolar macrophages harboring the
virus and activated T cells could promote ongoing injury and systemic inflammation. This model would also
explain the heterogeneity we observed in alveolar macrophages recovered from the same individual.
Different stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection might be spatially localized to subsegmental regions such that
the BAL procedure samples alveoli in various stages of infection. Further studies using spatial techniques
and a time-course analysis of patients with early disease will address these questions.

Methods:
Human subjects: All human subjects research was approved by the Northwestern University Institutional
Review Board. Samples from patients with COVID-19, viral pneumonia, other pneumonia and nonpneumonia controls were collected from participants enrolled in Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia
Therapy (SCRIPT) study STU00204868. Alveolar macrophages from healthy volunteers were obtained
under study STU00206783. All subjects or their surrogates provided informed consent.
Patients ≥ 18 years of age with suspicion of pneumonia based on clinical criteria (including but not limited
to fever, radiographic infiltrate, and respiratory secretions) were screened for enrollment into the SCRIPT
study. Inability to safely obtain BAL or NBBAL were considered exclusion criteria. In our center, patients
with respiratory failure are intubated based on the judgement of bedside clinicians for worsening
hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or work of breathing refractory to high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation
modes. Extubation occurs based on the judgement of bedside clinicians following a trial of spontaneous
breathing in patients demonstrating physiologic improvement in their cardiorespiratory status during their
period of mechanical ventilation.
Management of patients with COVID-19 was guided by protocols published and updated on the
Northwestern Medicine website as new information became available over the pandemic. Clinical
laboratory testing including studies ordered on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was at the discretion of the
care team, however, quantitative cultures, multiplex PCR (BioFire Film Array Respiratory 2 panel), and
automated cell count and differential were recommended by local ICU protocols. Most patients also
underwent urinary antigen testing for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophilia on
admission. Clinicians were encouraged to manage all patients, including those with COVID-19, according
to ARDSnet guidelines including the use of a higher PEEP/lower FIO2 strategy for those with severe
hypoxemia. Prone positioning (16 hours per day) was performed in all patients with a PaO2/FiO2 <150 who
did not have contraindications. In those who had a response to prone positioning evident by improved
oxygenation, prone positioning was repeated. Esophageal balloon catheters (Cooper Surgical) were placed
at the discretion of the care team to estimate transpulmonary pressure and optimize PEEP, particularly in
patients with a higher than normal BMI.
Pneumonia category adjudication was performed by five critical care physicians (RGW, JMK, BDS, COP,
JMW) using a standardized reporting tool (Supplemental Data File 7). Clinical laboratory data were
obtained from the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse using Structured Query Language
(SQL). APS and SOFA scores were generated from the Electronic Health Record using previously validated
programming.
NBBAL and BAL procedures: Consent was obtained from patients or legal decision makers for the
bronchoscopic procedures. Bronchoscopic BAL was performed in intubated ICU patients with flexible,
single-use Ambu aScope (Ambu) devices. Patients were given sedation and topical anesthetic at the
physician proceduralist’s discretion. Vital signs were monitored continuously throughout the procedure.
The bronchoscope was wedged in the segment of interest based on available chest imaging or intraprocedure observations, aliquots of 30 cc of normal saline at a time, generally 90–120 cc total, were instilled
and aspirated back. The fluid returned following the first aliquot was routinely discarded. Samples were
split (if sufficient return volume was available) and sent for clinical studies and an aliquot reserved for
research. A similar procedure was applied to non-bronchoscopic BAL (NBBAL); however NBBAL was

performed with directional but not visual guidance, and as usual procedural care by a respiratory therapist
rather than a pulmonologist[6].
For the bronchoscopies performed in the COVID-19 patients, additional precautions were taken to minimize
the risk to healthcare workers including only having essential providers present in the room, clamping of
the endotracheal tube, transient disconnection of the inspiratory limb from the ventilator, and preloading
of the bronchoscope through the adapter; sedation and neuromuscular blockade to prevent cough, was
administered for these procedures at the physician’s discretion. In most cases the early bronchoscopy was
performed immediately after intubation.
Flow cytometry and cell sorting: NBBAL and BAL samples were filtered through a 70 um cell strainer,
pelleted by centrifugation at 300 rcf for 10 min at 4C, followed by hypotonic lysis of red blood cells with 2
ml of BD PharmLyse reagent for 2 min. Lysis was stopped by adding 18 ml of MACS buffer. Cells were
pelleted again and resuspended in 100 ul of Fc-Block (Human TruStain FcX, Biolegend), and 10 ul aliquot
was taken for counting using K2 Cellometer (Nexcelom) with AO/PI reagent. The volume of Fc-Block was
adjusted so the concentration of cells was always less than 5x107 cells/ml and the fluorophore-conjugated
antibody cocktail was added in 1:1 ratio (Table 3). After incubation at 4C for 30 min cells were washed
with 5 ml of MACS buffer, pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 500 ul of MACS buffer + 2 ul of
SYTOX Green viability dye (ThermoFisher). Cells were sorted on FACS Aria II SORP instrument using
100 um nozzle and 20 psi pressure. Cells were sorted into 300 ul of MACS buffer for bulk RNA-seq or 300
ul of 2% BSA in PBS for single cell RNA-Seq. Sample processing was performed in BSL-2 facility using
BSL-3 practices.
Bulk RNA-Seq of flow-sorted alveolar macrophages: Immediately after sorting, cells were pelleted by
centrifugation and lysed in 350 ul of RLT Plus lysis buffer (Qiagen) supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol.
Lysed cells were stored at -80C until RNA isolation using AllPrep DNA/RNA Micro kit according to
manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen). RNA quality and quantity were assessed using TapeStation 4200 High
Sensitivity RNA tapes (Agilent) and RNA-Seq libraries were prepared from 250 pg of total RNA using
SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v2 (Takara Bio). After QC using TapeStation 4200 High Sensitivity
DNA tapes (Agilent) dual indexed libraries were pooled and sequenced on a NextSeq 500 instrument
(Illumina), 75 cycles, single-end, to an average sequencing depth of 19.55M reads.
FASTQ files were generated using bcl2fastq (Illumina). To enable detection of viral RNA, a custom hybrid
genome was prepared by joining FASTA, GFF, and GTF files for GRCh37.87, SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2)
– virus causing COVID-19, and Influenza A/California/07/2009 (GCF_001343785.1), which was the
dominant strain of influenza throughout BAL fluid collection at our hospital [43]. An additional negative
strand transcript spanning the entirety of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was then added to the GTF and GFF
files to enable detection of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Normalized counts tables later revealed extremely high
enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 transcripts in diagnosed COVID-19 patients, and strong enrichment of IAV
genes in patients marked as other viral pneumonia. To facilitate reproducible analysis, samples were
processed using the publicly available nf-core/RNA-seq pipeline version 1.4.2 implemented in Nextflow
19.10.0 using Singularity 3.2.1-1 with the minimal command nextflow run nf-core/rnaseq -r 1.4.2 –
singleEnd -profile singularity –unStranded --three_prime_clip_r2 3 [44–46]. Briefly, lane-level
reads were trimmed using trimGalore! 0.6.4 and aligned to the hybrid genome described above using STAR
2.6.1d [47]. Gene-level assignment was then performed using featureCounts 1.6.4 [48].

Bulk differential expression analysis (DEA). All analysis was performed using custom scripts in R
version 3.6.3 using the DESeq2 version 1.26.0 framework[49]. Correspondence between lanes was first
confirmed by principal component analysis before merging counts using the command
collapseReplicates(). One outlier sample with low RIN score and exhibiting extreme deviation on PCA
and poor alignment and assignment metrics was excluded from downstream analysis. For differential
expression analysis (DEA), both MoAM content from flow cytometry data and diagnosis were used as
explanatory factors. A “local” model of gene dispersion was employed as this better fit dispersion trends
without obvious overfitting; otherwise default settings were used.
K-means clustering of bulk samples. For k-means clustering, a custom-built function was used
(available at https://github.com/NUPulmonary/utils/blob/master/R/k_means_figure.R). Briefly, variable
genes were identified using a likelihood-ratio test (LRT) with local estimates of gene dispersion in DESeq2
with diagnosis as the “full” model, and a reduced model corresponding to intercept, alone. Genes with q ≥
0.05 were discarded. Extant genes were then clustered using the Hartigan-Wong method with 25 random
sets and a maximum of 1000 iterations using the kmeans function in R stats 3.6.3. Samples were then
clustered using Ward’s method and plotted using pheatmap version 1.0.12. GO term enrichment was then
determined using Fisher’s exact test in topGO version 2.38.1, with org.Hs.eg.db version 3.10.0 as a
reference.
Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). WGCNA was performed manually using
WGCNA version 1.69 with default settings unless otherwise noted [50]. Genes with counts >5 and detection
in at least 10% of samples were included in analysis. To best capture patterns of co-regulation, a signed
network was used. Using the pickSoftThreshold function, we empirically determined a soft threshold of 7
to best fit the network structure. A minimum module size of 30 was chosen to isolate relatively large gene
modules. Module eigengenes were then related back to patient and sample metadata using biweight
midcorrelation. Module GO enrichment was then determined as above using Fisher’s exact test in topGO
version 2.38.1, with org.Hs.eg.db version 3.10.0 as a reference. UMAP plotting was performed using uwot
version 0.1.8 using the first 20 principal components of the same genes used in WGCNA analysis after Zscaling and centering, with a minimum distance of 0.2 [51]. Default parameters were otherwise used.
Single cell RNA-Seq of flow-sorted BAL cells: Cells were sorted into 2% BSA in DPBS, pelleted by
centrifugation at 300 rcf for 5 min at 4C, resuspended in 0.1% BSA in DPBS to ~1000 cells/ul concentration.
Concentration was confirmed using K2 Cellometer (Nexcelom) with AO/PI reagent and ~5,000–10,000 cells
were loaded on 10x Genomics Chip A with Chromium Single Cell 5’ gel beads and reagents (10x Genomics).
Libraries were prepared according to manufacturer protocol (10x Genomics, CG000086_RevM). After
quality check single cell RNA-seq libraries were pooled and sequenced on NovaSeq 6000 instrument.
Data was processed using Cell Ranger 3.1.0 pipeline (10x Genomics). To enable detection of viral RNA,
reads were aligned to a custom hybrid genome containing GRCh38.93 and SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512.2).
An additional negative strand transcript spanning the entirety of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was then
added to the GTF and GFF files to enable detection of SARS-CoV-2 replication. Data was processed using
Scanpy v1.5.1 [52], doublets were detected with scrublet v0.2.1 [53] and removed, ribosomal genes were
removed and multisample integration was performed with BBKNN v1.3.12 [54]. Gene set enrichment
analysis was performed with signatures retrieved from gsea-msigdb.org website [55] using following
terms: HALLMARK_INTERFERON_GAMMA_RESPONSE M5913,

HALLMARK_INTERFERON_ALPHA_RESPONSE M5911. Computations were automated with
snakemake v5.5.4 [56].
Deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq alveolar macrophage signatures was performed using AutoGeneS
v1.0.3[57] and signatures derived from integrated single cell RNA-Seq object. For details of the functions
used and their parameters see the code https://github.com/NUPulmonary/2020_Grant.
Statistical analysis: All statistical analysis was performed using R version 3.6.3. For all comparisons,
normality was first assured using a Shapiro-Wilk test and manual examination of distributions. For
parameters exhibiting a clear lack of normality, nonparametric tests were employed. In cases of multiple
testing, P-values were corrected using false-discovery rate (FDR) correction. Adjusted P-values < 0.05 were
considered significant.
Visualization: All plotting was performed using ggplot2 version 3.3.1, with the exception of heatmaps,
which were generated using pheatmap version 1.0.12. Sankey/Alluvial plots were generated using
ggalluvial version 0.12.0[58]. Figure layouts were generated using patchwork version 1.01 and edited in
Adobe Illustrator 2020.
