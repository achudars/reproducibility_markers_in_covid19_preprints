Summary

30

Nucleocapsid protein (N) is the most abundant viral protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2, the

31

causative agent of COVID-19. N plays key roles at different steps in the replication cycle

32

and is used as a serological marker of infection. Here we characterize the biochemical

33

properties of SARS-CoV-2 N. We define the N domains important for oligomerization and

34

RNA binding that are associated with spherical droplet formation and suggest that N

35

accessibility and assembly may be regulated by phosphorylation. We also map the RNA

36

binding interface using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. Finally, we

37

find that the N protein C-terminal domain is the most immunogenic by sensitivity, based

38

upon antibody binding to COVID-19 patient samples from the US and Hong Kong.

39

Together, these findings uncover domain-specific insights into the significance of SARS-

40

CoV-2 N and highlight the diagnostic value of using N domains as highly specific and

41

sensitive markers of COVID-19.

Introduction

46

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus

47

and the causative agent of COVID-19. Coronavirus has a single-stranded, positive-sense

48

RNA genome. The genome encodes four major structural proteins: spike (S), envelope

49

(E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). The N protein is the second most proximal to

50

the 3’ end of the genome and is one of the most abundantly expressed viral proteins given

51

the multifunctional roles N has during viral replication and assembly (Fung and Liu, 2019;

52

Kim et al., 2020; McBride et al., 2014; Perlman and Netland, 2009). It is estimated that

53

1,000 copies of N are incorporated into each virion versus only 100 copies of S (Bar-On

54

et al., 2020). Whereas N exists mostly in a phosphorylated state in the cytoplasm, it is

55

predominantly in a dephosphorylated state in mature virions, suggesting that genome

56

packaging is regulated by the phosphorylation state of N (Wu et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2009).

57

A critical function of N is to encapsidate the ssRNA viral genome to evade immune

58

detection and to protect the viral RNA from degradation by host factors (Chang et al.,

59

2014; McBride et al., 2014). N has two structural domains (Figure 1A): a N-terminal

60

domain (NNTD; amino acid residues 44-176) and a C-terminal domain (NCTD; residues 248-

61

369). NNTD is often referred to as the RNA-binding domain (RBD), although the exact

62

regions involved in RNA binding are not yet well defined (Chang et al., 2014; Grossoehme

63

et al., 2009; Gui et al., 2017; Kang et al., 2020; McBride et al., 2014). The isolated NCTD

64

exists as a dimer in solution and is potentially involved in RNA binding as well (Bouhaddou

65

et al., 2020; Gui et al., 2017; Takeda et al., 2008). A conserved serine/arginine rich-linker

66

region (NLKR) connects the NNTD and the NCTD. Phosphorylation of residues in the LKR is

67

believed to regulate discontinuous transcription, particularly for shorter subgenomic

68

mRNA closer to the 3’ end during early stages of replication (Wu et al., 2014; Wu et al.,

69

2009). The LKR, along with Narm and Carm, have been shown to be intrinsically

70

disordered (Chang et al., 2014; Cubuk et al., 2020). However, the LKR is similarly

71

conserved as the NTD and CTD (Figure 1B and Supp. Figure 1B), supporting its

72

essential functional role across strains of coronaviruses (Chang et al., 2014), while the

73

Narm and Carm are the least conserved regions.

74

Given its abundant expression and conservation within the genome, N has been used as

75

an antigen for serology tests (Chew et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020a, b), such as the widely

76

used Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay and Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Tang

77

et al., 2020a, b). Comparison of the serological response to the entire proteome of the

78

SARS-CoV-2 virus using a luciferase immunoprecipitation assay (LIPS) (Hachim et al.,

79

2020) showed that N-specific antibodies dominated the overall antibody response.

80

Furthermore, the T cell responses directed towards N are highly immunodominant in

81

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection, with N-specific memory T cell responses evident

82

17 years after the initial SARS-CoV infection (Le Bert et al., 2020). Due to epitope

83

conservation of the N protein, there is some T cell cross-reactivity towards the N of the

84

SARS-CoV-2 (Le Bert et al., 2020). The N protein stability, RNA binding characteristics,

85

abundance, and conservation altogether impact immunogenicity for T and B cell

86

immunities.

87

Previous studies, including our own, have examined fundamental properties of

88

nucleocapsid or nucleoproteins (N) from RNA viruses, which revealed overlapping and

89

unique functions (Arragain et al., 2019; Ding et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2020; Luo et al., 2020;

90

Raymond et al., 2010; Su et al., 2018; Wan et al., 2017). These include the insights into

91

RNA binding, oligomerization, as well as potential roles in RNA synthesis and immune

92

evasion. However, such studies for SARS-CoV-2 N protein remain incomplete. To

93

address this gap, here we use a series of biochemical and biophysical assays to probe

94

essential functions of N. Our results reveal that oligomeric N provides a continuous RNA

95

binding platform and that N-RNA has different morphologies, including spherical droplets.

96

Our data also suggest how phosphorylation could modulate these processes, which can

97

be exploited by drugs targeting of these cellular processes (Bouhaddou et al., 2020).

98

Given the recent progress in SARS-CoV-2 spike-based vaccines, knowledge of N will

99

likely provide the basis to differentiate individuals with immunity due to natural infections

100

from those that are immunized. Such tools will play a critical role in managing herd

101

immunity. In addition, our domain-specific insights into the immunogenicity of N provide

102

opportunities to further enhance sensitivity and specificity of serology testing. Therefore,

103

insights gained here regarding N protein function and regulation are critical for improving

104

diagnostic testing for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks.

105
106

Results

107

Multiple domains within N protein are important for oligomerization. To characterize

108

how the domains of N contribute to oligomerization, we used dynamic light scattering

109

(DLS) to determine the hydrodynamic properties of isolated N domains. The results reveal

110

that there are two major oligomeric species for wildtype (WT) N (NWT; 46 kDa), one with

111

a hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of 8.9 nm and another of 450 nm (Figure 1C and 1D). For

112

comparison, the Rh values for maltose binding protein (44 kDa) and bovine serum albumin

113

(66 kDa) are 2.9 nm and 3.7 nm, respectively. Removal of the Narm and Carm (NNTD-LKR5

114

CTD)

generates two major species, similar to NWT. However, both NNTD-LKR-CTD populations

115

display reduced polydispersity (peak width, Supp. Figure 2A) in the high order oligomeric

116

species, suggesting that both arms contribute to N oligomerization. Removal of the CTD

117

(NNTD-LKR) results in a single peak representing a dimeric species (Rh = 3.9 nm), but with

118

considerable polydispersity. NNTD and NCTD alone are stable domains; NNTD is a monomer

119

(Rh = 2.3 nm) whereas NCTD is a dimer in solution (Rh = 3.5 nm). Exact mass measurement

120

by denaturing mass spectrometry yields values corresponding to the expected sequence

121

(± 1 Da) and supports the identity of the constructs used here (Supp. Figure 2B-E).

122
123

N provides an oligomerization platform for high affinity RNA binding. N

124

encapsidates viral genomic ssRNA in a sequence-independent manner (Chang et al.,

125

2014). To gain insight into how each N domain contributes to ssRNA binding, we

126

measured fluorescence polarization (FP) upon binding of a FITC-labeled 20-nt ssRNA

127

(Sequence: UUUCACCUCCCUUUCAGUUU) (Figure 2A). We find that NWT binds the

128

20-nt ssRNA with high affinity (KD = 0.007 ± 0.001 μM). Removal of the Narm and Carm

129

do not impact ssRNA binding (KD = 0.006 ± 0.002 and 0.006 ± 0.002 μM for NNTD-LKR-CTD-

130

Carm

131

have low affinity binding (KD = 20 ± 10 and 13 ± 5 μM, respectively), both of which bind

132

with increased affinity after inclusion of the LKR region (Figure 2B-2D). Interestingly,

133

addition of CTD that dimerizes onto NTD-LKR improves the binding affinity to the single

134

digit nM range (Figure 2C). The affinity increase does not happen when CTD is provided

135

in trans (compare NNTD-LKR + NCTD with NNTD-LKR-CTD). This affinity increase also occurs

136

when NTD is added to LKR-CTD in cis (Figure 2D, compare NLKR-CTD + NNTD with NNTD-

and NNTD-LKR-CTD, respectively) (Figure 2B). The individual domains NNTD and NCTD

137

LKR-CTD).

Similar binding curves and KD values were obtained when fluorescence

138

anisotropy values were converted from polarization (Supp. Figure 3A). Collectively, our

139

data show that NTD, CTD, and LKR all contribute to ssRNA binding, and the presence of

140

three domains in tandem confers N with high affinity binding.

141
142

N also binds dsRNA and is proposed to disrupt dsRNA structures formed by transcription

143

regulatory sequences (TRS) during discontinuous transcription (Grossoehme et al., 2009;

144

Keane et al., 2012; Sola et al., 2015). We next tested N binding to a stem-loop RNA

145

(slRNA) (Sequence: GGAAGAUUAAUAAUUUUCC) (Figure 2E). We find that NWT binds

146

with relatively high affinity (KD = 0.051 ± 0.004 µM) whereas both NNTD and NCTD alone

147

have very weak binding affinities (KD = 120 ± 80 and 60 ± 40 µM, respectively). The

148

addition of LKR significantly improves binding, consistent with binding results for ssRNA.

149

Overall, binding of N to slRNA appears similar to binding to ssRNA, but at an order of

150

magnitude lower than that of ssRNA (Supp. Figure 3B). This may be due, in part, to the

151

energetic penalty of unfolding the stem loop structure. Furthermore, it seems that Narm

152

and Carm contribute more to slRNA binding than ssRNA because the reduction of KD for

153

slRNA are more pronounced after removing the Narm and Carm (Supp. Figure 3C).

154
155

N-RNA forms spherical droplets, requiring multiple N domains. Purification of

156

recombinant N protein on size exclusion chromatography revealed three populations,

157

including two RNA-bound states (p1 and p2) and an RNA-free state (p3) despite

158

purification in high salt (500 mM) to eliminate RNA binding (Figure 3A). Truncation of the

159

Narm results in an increase of the RNA-free peak (p3), suggesting that N truncations can

160

alter the structure of N and correspondingly impact N-related properties, such as RNA

161

binding and oligomerization, thereby potentially impacting the physiological function of N.

162

We observe an even greater shift to p3 when both Narm and Carm were removed,

163

suggesting that both arms contribute to RNA binding interactions. To gain additional

164

insight into the two RNA-bound populations p1 and p2, we visualized these samples by

165

using negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) in near-physiological salt concentrations

166

(150 mM). NWT p1 contains N-RNA with a loose-coil appearance (Figure 3B, top left),

167

similar to that observed for other RNA-bound nucleocapsids (Bharat et al., 2012; Mavrakis

168

et al., 2002). Other recent studies have also observed that N protein undergoes liquid-

169

liquid phase separation (LLPS) when mixed with RNA(Carlson et al., 2020; Cubuk et al.,

170

2020; Iserman et al., 2020; Jack et al., 2020; Savastano et al., 2020). In agreement with

171

these results, for NWT p2, we mostly observe spheres corresponding to liquid droplets

172

separated from the surrounding buffer (Figure 3B, top right).

173
174

We next examined the role of Narm and Carm on high-order assembly. NNTD-LKR-CTD-Carm

175

behaves similarly to NWT and has loose coils in p1 (Figure 3B, middle left) and forms

176

spherical liquid droplets in p2 (Figure 3B, middle right). However, examination of p2

177

from NNTD-LKR-CTD (Figure 3B, bottom right) revealed a much smaller population of liquid

178

droplets (red arrow) and mostly crystal-like needle aggregates, suggesting that the Carm

179

is important for droplet formation. A transition from spherical liquids to needle-like solids

180

is consistent with the liquid-to-solid transitions observed for other proteins that undergo

181

phase separation(Patel et al., 2015).

182

Phosphorylation of LKR modulates RNA binding and higher-order assembly.

183

Previous studies have shown that N is dephosphorylated in mature virions of a closely

184

related strain, SARS-CoV, and predominantly phosphorylated during active transcription

185

and replication in the cytoplasm (Wu et al., 2014). For SARS-CoV, glycogen synthase

186

kinase (GSK)-3 was shown to phosphorylate N at Ser177 (corresponding to Ser176 in

187

SARS-CoV-2 N) (Wu et al., 2009). Phosphorylation of Ser177 is preceded by

188

phosphorylation of Ser189 and Ser207 (Ser188 and 206 in SARS-CoV-2 N) by other

189

priming kinases (Wu et al., 2009). Moreover, N protein phosphorylation has been

190

qualitatively shown to modulate both RNA binding and phase separation(Carlson et al.,

191

2020; Lu et al., 2020; Savastano et al., 2020). To test if phosphorylation impacts RNA

192

binding and the phase separation of SARS CoV-2 N-RNA, we generated a set of N

193

phosphomimics by mutating specific serine residues to aspartate residues. Size exclusion

194

chromatography showed that, compared to NWT, NS188D/S206D produced a reduced RNA-

195

free peak (p3) and an increased RNA-bound peak (p1) (Figure 3C). Introduction of

196

S176D to generate NS176D/S188D/S206D resulted in an even greater shift in p1 and p3

197

distributions, showing how phosphorylation can affect N interactions with RNA. The height

198

of p2 remains relatively the same for all preparations. Examination of these protein peaks

199

using electron microscopy revealed that NS188D/S206D displays similar loose coils in p1

200

(Figure 3D, top left) and spherical droplets in p2 (Figure 3D, top right) for the RNA-

201

bound species. Similar observations were made for NS176D/S188D/S206D (Figure 3D). To

202

describe this interaction further, we measured ssRNA binding to the N phosphomimics

203

(Figure 3E and Supp. Figure 4A). NS176D/S188D/S206D displays ~5-fold lower binding affinity

204

to ssRNA compared to NWT binding, a result consistent with previous work examining the

205

impact of LKR phosphorylation on RNA binding(Savastano et al., 2020). We observed a

206

similar trend for the NNTD-LKR construct. Furthermore, binding to slRNA is also affected by

207

these mutations (Supp. Figure 4B). Collectively, our data suggest that phosphorylation

208

of the LKR region modulates N interactions with RNA, causing changes in solution

209

properties. Interestingly, there are 14 serine residues in the LKR, of which 13 are found

210

in SARS-CoV, and an increase in phosphorylation in this region may further enhance

211

these changes for RNA interaction and subsequent viral replication and immunogenicity.

212
213

Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) locates the RNA

214

binding interface of NTD-LKR. We performed HDX-MS to locate regions that become

215

protected upon RNA binding. Using NNTD-LKR-CTD, we observed phase-separation and

216

aggregation upon RNA binding, causing a 100-fold mass spectrometric signal loss for the

217

bound state possibly attributable to phase separation or aggregation inducing poor

218

digestion. However, this problem does not pertain to NNTD-LKR

219

digestion yielded 152 peptides after sequential FXIII and peptic digestion and provided

220

93.3% sequence coverage (Supp. Figure 5A).

221

HDX analysis of NNTD-LKR S176D/S188D/S206D shows clear protection in four distinct regions of

222

upon RNA binding (aa residues 41-63, 105-108, 146-171, and 213-230) (Figure 4A and

223

4B). Residues 133-143 are not perturbed by RNA binding, but peptides covering 146-171

224

show clear protection. The largest differences in HDX are observed where 50-80% of the

225

residues of unbound peptides undergo a burst phase of HDX in the first 10 s (146-156,

226

163-171, and 213-230 aa), i.e., the peptides cover regions of little hydrogen bonding in

227

the unbound state. When bound to RNA, the fraction of residues participating in the burst

S176D/S188D/S206D

228

phase decreases, resulting in observed protection. Then, HDX either converges over time

229

(146-156, 163-171, and 219-223 aa) consistent with protein conformation or RNA binding

230

dynamics, or the HDX never converges in the timescale of the experiment (222-230 aa),

231

consistent with relatively static binding. Interestingly, peptides covering 103-108 aa and

232

156-159 aa undergo very little HDX throughout the experiment, consistent with either

233

hydrogen bonding of secondary and tertiary structure or a hydrophobic pocket. Of note,

234

HDX decreases for the bound state in these peptides only after 1 h. The low initial HDX

235

limits the dynamic range of binding-induced protection from HDX, but statistically

236

significant protection is still observed.

237

Further, HDX analysis revealed that the protected regions (Figure 4C) overlap well with

238

a basic patch groove in the NNTD structure (Figure 4D). In addition, a region (213-230 aa)

239

within the LKR domain, after the structured domain and SR-motif, shows statistically

240

significant HDX protection. Interestingly, we did not detect HDX protection in the SR-motif,

241

which was proposed to bind RNA. This may be due to the Ser-to-Asp mutations

242

introduced into this region, changing the RNA binding patterns. Altogether, HDX results

243

along with our biochemical data define an RNA binding interface within the NTD-LKR

244

region.

246

NCTD is a sensitive serological marker. Current sero-diagnostic assays to identify

247

COVID-19 positive individuals are based on the detection of antibodies against N due to

248

its abundant expression and corresponding high immune response (Chew et al., 2020;

249

Tang et al., 2020a, b). However, these N-directed serological assays are highly variable

250

and their sensitivity depend on the sampling time-points, ranging from 0% to 93.75% (Liu

252

infection can be further improved.

254

Given that the domains of N impact the various essential properties of N, we next

255

assessed which domains contribute to the observed N immunodominance in RT-PCR

256

confirmed COVID-19 patients. Plasma samples were collected from two cohorts, one in

257

St. Louis, USA (n = 45) and one in Hong Kong (n = 23), at different time points of infection

258

(Supplementary Table 1). Using these samples, we performed enzyme-linked

259

immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to detect IgG present in COVID-19 patient plasma to

260

different N domains. First, we confirmed that purified NWT is a sensitive serological marker

261

to differentiate between COVID-19 positive and negative individuals (Figure 5A). As

262

shown in Figure 5B, antibodies against all five N constructs were detected in the COVID-

263

19 cohort (p < 0.0001 versus negative controls for all). A cut-off based on the mean of the

264

negatives plus three standard deviations allowed us to assess the performance of each

265

N construct at detecting IgG antibodies in COVID-19 positive individuals (Figure 5C). We

266

find that NNTD-LKR-CTD-Carm shows the lowest sensitivity (41.2%), whereas the truncated

267

NNTD-LKR-CTD can detect more COVID-19 positive individuals (70.6%). Furthermore, NCTD

268

shows the highest combination of sensitivity (75%) and specificity (96.4%) over the other

269

N constructs tested. This is demonstrated by the lowest cut-off score for the NCTD for

270

negative control samples, despite a comparable level of amino acid sequence

271

conservation of the NCTD (29-41%) to the NNTD (32-48%) and NLKR (28-42%) domains with

272

common cold corona viruses (Figure 1B).

274

We next compared the immunogenicity of NNTD-LKR-CTD-Carm to NCTD and NNTD on an IgG

275

heatmap during natural infection to an independent panel of 67 COVID-19 samples from

276

Hong Kong. The magnitude of the IgG response to the NNTD-LKR-CTD-Carm tends to follow

277

the same trend as that of NCTD (Figure 5D). When we assessed the kinetics of NCTD and

278

the NNTD-LKR-CTD-Carm responses, we find that the magnitude of the NCTD IgG detection

279

tends to reach a similar level to that of NNTD-LKR-CTD-Carm at convalescent time-points (after

280

day 14) (Figure 5E). The ELISA ratio of NCTD/NNTD-LKR-CTD-Carm demonstrates this finding,

281

pointing to a maturation of the humoral immune response towards the NCTD with time after

282

infection (Figure 5F, p < 0.0001 for acute versus convalescent time-points). The early

283

dominance of the NNTD-LKR-CTD-Carm IgG response may reflect the recruitment of a cross-

284

reactive pre-existing N-specific response. This response becomes more specific with time

285

for the NCTD domain as a de novo antibody response is made.

286
287

Given that some RNA viral N proteins are known immune antagonists, including prior

288

studies of SARS-CoV, we hypothesized that N from SARS-CoV-2 may also suppress the

289

type-I interferon (IFN) signaling pathway (Messaoudi et al., 2015). Using an IFN-β

290

promoter assay, we showed that N has a role in suppressing IFN signaling pathway when

291

stimulated by Sendai virus (SeV) infection (Figure 5G). NWT can inhibit IFN-β promoter

292

activity, although not as well as Měnglà virus (MLAV) VP35, a potent inhibitor of IFN

293

signaling (Williams et al., 2020). Both NNarm-NTD-LKR and NNTD show modest inhibition at

294

the highest concentration tested. However, NCTD-Carm shows similar levels of inhibition as

295

NWT, and NCTD displays the highest inhibition even at lower protein concentrations. In

296

summary, N is a potent inhibitor of IFN signaling and the CTD domain appears to be the

297

region critical for mediating this function.

Discussion

300

SARS-CoV-2 N protein is a core viral protein produced by the subgenomic RNA,

301

positioned proximal to the 3’ end of genome, display high transcription levels, and is in

302

high abundance in virions. N is prone to forming higher-order oligomers that have a role

303

in binding to the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 and nucleocapsid formation. N is also

304

regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, which changes

305

the physiochemical properties of N and likely directs its multiple roles at different stages

306

of the viral replication cycle.

307
308

Here we used a series of N constructs to dissect how each domain contributes to

309

oligomerization and RNA binding, and how phosphorylation can modulate these

310

properties. N oligomerization and RNA binding are likely linked; N oligomerization

311

provides a platform for high affinity RNA interactions whereas genomic RNA serves as a

312

string connecting N proteins. The modular domains of N provide multiple regulatory layers

313

for genomic access. For example, phosphorylation of N in the LKR region reduces RNA

314

binding to N and modify distribution of N-RNA species.

316

We also gained insight into the antigenicity of individual domains of N and its potential

317

utility in serological studies. We data revealed that NCTD acts more specifically in detecting

318

infection of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, from plasma in comparison

319

to NWT. Consistent with our observation, the NCTD region is also predicted to encompass

320

major antigenic sites of N (Bussmann et al., 2006; Liang et al., 2005). Owing to the relative

321

conservation of N within coronaviruses, it is crucial to understand how N-directed

322

antibodies generated by different coronaviruses are cross-reactive with those that are

323

derived when exposed to SARS-CoV-2. The common cold coronavirus protective

324

immunity is short-lasting (Edridge et al., 2020); reinfection with the same seasonal

325

coronavirus occurred frequently at 12 months after the initial infection using an ELISA

326

approach against the N C-terminal region (coronavirus NL63, 215-377 aa; 229E, 213-389

327

aa; OC43, 328-428 aa; HKU1, 326-441 aa), which is similar to the NCTD region we used

328

(SARS-CoV-2, 248-369 aa). Interestingly, 2 out of 10 individuals assessed in this study

329

of longitudinal donors unexposed to SARS-CoV-2 by Edridge et al., produced broadly

330

reactive antibodies towards SARS-CoV-2 NWT. The possibility of broadly reactive

331

antibodies in unexposed individuals highlights the need for domain specific serology, such

332

as our use of the NCTD for increased sensitivity to discriminate COVID-19 cases, while

333

reducing the false-positive rate from cross reactive antibodies generated by infections of

334

the common cold coronaviruses.

335
336

In conclusion, we describe our efforts to characterize domain specific insights into

337

essential biochemical and serological properties of SARS-CoV-2 N. Our results advance

338

the understanding of viral replication processes and highlight the diagnostic value of using

339

N domains as a highly specific and sensitive markers of COVID-19. While our study

340

highlights the important functions associated with NCTD, much remains to be characterized,

341

including the mechanistic link between the high immunogenicity of NCTD and the physical

342

properties such as RNA binding and oligomerization.

Methods

346

Patients and sample collection. Our study enrolled a total of 67 patients with RT-PCR

347

confirmed COVID-19 infection: with 45 patients from St. Louis, MO, USA, and 23 patients

348

from Hong Kong, PRC. The negative samples (n = 28) used in this study were from St.

349

Louis, USA, and were obtained from patients following the start of the pandemic. Plasma

350

samples were obtained from patients at Barnes-Jewish Hospital (St. Louis, MO, USA)

351

and the Hong Kong Island West Cluster of Hospitals (Hong Kong, PRC). Both hospital

352

systems are urban, tertiary-care, academic medical centers. Positive and negative

353

patients from all cohorts were confirmed using standard of care, RT-PCR based methods.

354

The collection of patient plasma was approved by the Human Research Protection Office

355

at Washington University in St. Louis (IRB reference number 202007097) and the

356

Institutional Review Board of The Hong Kong University and the Hong Kong Island West

357

Cluster of Hospitals (IRB reference number UW20-169). Plasma samples were collected

358

from heparinized blood. Sample day was defined as days post-symptom onset.

360

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA assays were performed with

361

Nucleoprotein (N) proteins made in house, as described below. Briefly, recombinant N

362

proteins were coated on 96 well flatbottom immunosorbent plates (Nunc Immuno

363

MaxiSorp) at a concentration of 500 ng/mL, in 100 μL coating buffer (PBS with 53%

364

Na2CO3 and 42% NaHCO3, pH 9.6) at 4°C overnight. An additional plate coated with a

365

non‐specific protein (blocking buffer, PBS with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS)) was used

366

to measure the background binding of each plasma sample. Following FBS blocking and

367

thorough washing, diluted plasma samples (1:100) were bound for 2 hours, further

368

washed and then detected by an anti‐human IgG secondary antibody labelled with HRP

369

(Invitrogen), and absorbance detected at 450nm on a spectrophotometer (Wallac).

Protein Expression and Purification. SARS-CoV-2 N constructs were expressed as

372

His-tag fusion proteins in BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells (Novagen). At OD600 of 0.6-0.7,

373

recombinant protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-d-1-

374

thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 12-14 h at 18˚C. Cells were harvested and resuspended

375

in lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 1 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 5 mM 2-

376

mecaptoethanol (BME). Cells were lysed using an EmulsiFlex-C5 homogenizer (Avestin)

377

and lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 x g at 4 ˚C for 40 min. N proteins

378

were purified using affinity tag and gel filtration columns. Purity of N proteins were

HDX-MS. NNTD-LKR S176D/S188D/S206D was incubated with a 20-nt ssRNA at a 1:1 ratio. After

416

incubation, 2 μL of 50 μM protein/protein-RNA in PBS (pH 7.4) was diluted 10-fold (v/v)

417

with labeling buffer (PBS in D2O, pD 7.0) (D2O from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories),

418

incubated for 10, 30, 300, and 3600 s on ice, quenched by using a 60% dilution with 3 M

419

urea, PBS (pH 2.5), and flash frozen for later LC-MS analysis. A 0 s control was prepared

420

with PBS in H2O. Prior to incubation, each 50 μL of 2 μM sample was thawed for 1 min at

421

37 °C before injection into a custom-built liquid chromatography (LC) apparatus for LC-
