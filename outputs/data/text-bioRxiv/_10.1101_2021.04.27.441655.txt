Abstract
SARS-CoV in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, and SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern

33

(VOC) can cause deadly infections, underlining the importance of developing broadly effective

34

countermeasures against Group 2B Sarbecoviruses, which could be key in the rapid prevention

35

and mitigation of future zoonotic events. Here, we demonstrate the neutralization of SARS-CoV,

36

bat CoVs WIV-1 and RsSHC014, and SARS-CoV-2 variants D614G, B.1.1.7, B.1.429, B1.351

37

by a receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibody DH1047. Prophylactic and therapeutic

38

treatment with DH1047 demonstrated protection against SARS-CoV, WIV-1, RsSHC014, and

39

SARS-CoV-2 B1.351infection in mice. Binding and structural analysis showed high affinity

40

binding of DH1047 to an epitope that is highly conserved among Sarbecoviruses. We conclude

41

that DH1047 is a broadly neutralizing and protective antibody that can prevent infection and

42

mitigate outbreaks caused by SARS-like strains and SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our results argue

43

that the RBD conserved epitope bound by DH1047 is a rational target for pan Group 2B

44

coronavirus vaccines.

47

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) in 2003 led to more

48

than 8,000 infections and 800 deaths 1,2. In 2012, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome

49

(MERS-CoV) emerged in Saudi Arabia 3, which has so far infected ~2,600 people and caused

50

900 deaths. Less than a decade following the emergence of MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 emerged

51

in Wuhan, China 4. The spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease of

52

2019 (COVID-19) was rapid, and by March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) had

53

declared SARS-CoV-2 a global pandemic. By April 2021, more than 140 million people had

54

been infected globally, resulting in >3 million deaths. Therefore, there is a need to develop safe

55

and effective broad-spectrum countermeasures that can prevent the rapid spread and attenuate the

56

severe disease outcomes associated with current and future SARS-like virus emergence events.
Human highly pathogenic CoV outbreaks are likely of bat origin 5, and there is great

57
58

genetic diversity among bat SARS-like viruses 6. Zoonotic CoVs of bat origin, such as

59

RsSHC014 and WIV-1, can utilize the human ACE2 receptor for cell entry and infect human

60

airway cells 7,8, underlining their potential for emergence in naïve human populations. Moreover,

61

existing SARS-CoV therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines do

62

not protect against zoonotic SARS-like virus infection 7-9. Given the pandemic potential of

63

SARS-like viruses, the development of broadly effective countermeasures, such as universal

64

vaccination strategies 9-11, and coronavirus (CoV) cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies is a

65

global health priority. Moreover, given the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 variants that are

66

partially or fully resistant to some neutralizing antibodies authorized for COVID-19 treatment 12-

67

14

68

variants and zoonotic SARS-like viruses that will continue to emerge in the future.

, there is a need to discover mAb therapies that are broadly effective against the SARS-CoV-2

69

The receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is one of the targets for highly

70

potent neutralizing antibodies. Despite the high degree of genetic diversity within the RBD in

71

SARS-like viruses 6, antibodies can be engineered to recognize diverse SARS-like viruses.

72

Rappazzo et al. recently reported that an engineered RBD-directed antibody, ADG-2, neutralized

73

SARS-like viruses and protected against SARS-CoV and wild type SARS-CoV-2 15. Therefore,

74

the RBD of Sarbecoviruses contains conserved epitopes that are the target of broadly

75

neutralizing antibodies. In agreement with the notion that the RBD contains a conserved epitope

76

shared among SARS, SARS-like, SARS-CoV-2 and the variants, we have identified a panCoV

77

protective antibody: DH1047. Here, we demonstrate, using both pseudoviruses and live virus

78

assays, that DH1047 neutralizes SARS-CoV, SARS-like bat viruses RsSHC014 and WIV-1, and

79

SARS-CoV-2 D614G, B.1.1.7, B.1.429, B.1.351 variants. Structural analysis shows that

80

DH1047 targets a highly conserved RBD region among the Sarbecoviruses. Importantly, we also

81

demonstrate that DH1047 provides prophylactic and therapeutic protection activity against

82

pathogenic SARS-CoV, RsSHC014, WIV-1, wild type SARS-CoV-2, and against a pathogenic

83

B.1.351 variant in mice. Thus, DH1047 is a pan-group 2B CoV protective antibody that can be

84

used to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infections including important with variants of concern

85

and has the potential to prevent disease from a future outbreak of a pre-emergent, zoonotic

86

SARS-like virus strains that jump into naïve animal and human populations.

The identification of broadly cross-binding and neutralizing antibodies

We previously isolated 1737 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from a SARS-CoV

92

36 days post infection 16. From this large panel of mAbs previously described by Li et al. we

93

focused on 50 cross-reactive antibodies which bound to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and other

94

human and animal CoV antigens 16. To examine if these cross-reactive mAbs neutralized

95

divergent Sarbecoviruses, we measured neutralizing activity against a mouse-adapted SARS-

96

CoV-2 2AA mouse-adapted (MA) virus, SARS-CoV, bat CoV WIV-1, and bat CoV RsSHC014

97

using live viruses, and found four broadly cross-reactive antibodies, DH1235, DH1073,

98

DH1046, and DH1047 (Fig. 1). DH1235 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 2AA MA, SARS-CoV, and

99

bat CoV WIV-1 with IC50 of 0.122, 0.0403, and 0.060 µg/ml, respectively (Fig. 1A and Table

100

S1). DH1073 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 2AA MA, SARS-CoV, and bat CoV WIV-1 with IC50 of

101

0.808, 0.016, and 0.267 µg/ml, respectively (Fig. 1B and Table S1). DH1046 neutralized SARS-

102

CoV-2 2AA MA, SARS-CoV, bat CoV WIV-1, and bat CoV RsSHC014 with IC50 of 2.85,

103

0.103, 0.425, and 1.27µg/ml, respectively (Fig. 1C and Table S1). Similar to DH1046, DH1047

104

more potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 2AA MA, SARS-CoV, bat CoV WIV-1, and bat CoV

105

RsSHC014 with IC50 of 0.397, 0.028, 0.191, and 0.200µg/ml, respectively (Fig. 1D and Table

106

S1).

107

We also measured binding responses for DH1235, DH1073, DH1046, and DH1047

108

against zoonotic bat RaTG13-CoV, bat RsSHC014, and Pangolin GXP4L-CoV spikes. DH1235,

109

DH1073, DH1046, and DH1047 mAbs showed strong binding to bat RaTG13-CoV, bat

110

RsSHC014, and pangolin GXP4L-CoV spikes in addition to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (Fig.

111

1E-1H). Finally, DH1235, DH1073, DH1046, and DH1047 bound to SARS-CoV-2 RBD and did

112

not bind to the SARS-CoV-2 NTD, demonstrating specific binding to the RBD. While DH1235,

113

DH1073, DH1046, and DH1047 were cross-reactive against epidemic, pandemic, and zoonotic

114

Sarbecovirus spikes, they did not bind to MERS-CoV, HuCoV OC43, HuCoV NL63, and

115

HuCoV 229E spike proteins (Fig. S1), suggesting these mAbs recognize a conserved epitope

116

found only in Group 2B betacoronaviruses. By Negative Stain Electron Microscopy (NSEM), we

117

observed binding of DH1047 to the RBD of bat RsSHC014 and SARS-CoV spike ectodomains,

118

with overall similar orientations as was observed for DH1047 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 spike

119

ectodomain (Figure S2) 16.

120

Finally, DH1235, DH1073, DH1046, and DH1047 exhibited medium to long heavy-

121

chain-complementarity-determining-region 3 (HCDR3) lengths and variable somatic mutation

122

rates in the heavy chain genes. DH1235, DH1073, and DH1046, had HCDR3 lengths of 21, 15,

123

and 24, and somatic hypermutation (SMH) rates of 1.7, 9.0, and 4.7, respectively (Table S2). The

124

most potent neutralizing antibody DH1047 had HCDR3 lengths and SMH rates of 24 and 8.05,

125

respectively (Table S2).

128

The protective activity of DH1235, DH1073, DH1046, and DH1047 against SARS-CoV
To define the protective efficacy of these four RBD-specific IgG bNAbs, we passively

129

immunized aged mice with DH1235, DH1073, DH1046, DH1047 and a negative control

130

influenza mAb, CH65 17, at 10mg/kg 12 hours prior to infection and evaluated lung viral titer

131

replication. Neither DH1235, DH1073, nor DH1046 protected against SARS-CoV mouse-

132

adapted passage 15 (MA15) challenge in mice and all had lung viral replication comparable to

133

that of control mice (Fig. 2A). In contrast, prophylactic administration of DH1047 fully protected

134

mice from lung viral titer replication (Fig. 2A). Given the prophylactic potential of DH1047, we

135

sought to also evaluate its therapeutic potential in a highly sensitive and stringent aged mouse

136

model. We treated mice with control mAb and DH1047 at 10mg/kg both at 12 hours before and

137

12 hours post infection with SARS-CoV MA15 and monitored mice for signs of clinical disease,

138

including weight loss, pulmonary function, which was measured by whole-body

139

plethysmography (Buxco), through day 4 post infection (d4pi). In agreement with the SARS-

140

CoV MA15 experiments, prophylactic treatment with DH1047 protected mice from weight loss

141

through d4pi (Fig. 2B), and also protected mice from lung viral replication (Fig. 2C). We also

142

evaluated if the prophylactic and therapeutic administration of DH1047 protected against lung

143

pathology as measured by 1) lung discoloration, which is a visual metric of gross lung damage

144

taken at the time of the necropsy, 2) microscopic evaluation as measured by an acute lung injury

145

(ALI) scheme, and 3) a diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) scheme. ALI and DAD, which are

146

characterized by histopathologic changes including alveolar septal thickening, protein exudate in

147

the airspace, hyaline membrane formation, and neutrophils in the interstitium or alveolar sacs,

148

were both blindly evaluated by a board-certified veterinary pathologist. The prophylactic

149

administration of DH1047 resulted in complete protection from macroscopic lung discoloration

150

(Fig. 2D) and microscopic lung pathology as measured by ALI (Fig. 2E and Fig. S3) and DAD

151

(Fig. 2F and Fig. S3). Similarly, the therapeutic administration of DH1047 12 hours post

152

infection resulted in reductions in lung viral titers (Fig. 2C and Fig. S3) as well as the

153

macroscopic lung damage measured by the lung discoloration score (Fig. 2D and Fig. S3). In

154

contrast to the prophylactic treatment condition, therapeutic administration of DH1047 did not

155

significantly reduce microscopic lung pathology compared to control mice as measured by ALI

156

(Fig. 2E and Fig. S3) and DAD (Fig. 2F and Fig. S3) in this highly susceptible model for SARS-

157

CoV pathogenesis. Thus, DH1047 can prevent SARS-CoV disease when administered

158

prophylactically and has early measurable therapeutic benefits in highly susceptible aged mouse

159

models, much like other SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic neutralizing antibodies which have the most

160

benefit in outpatient settings 4,18,19.

162

Cryo-EM structure of the SARS-CoV/DH1047 complex

163

To visualize the binding epitope of DH1047 and to compare with the previously reported

164

structure of the complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain16, we solved the cryo-EM

165

structure of SARS-CoV bound to DH1047. 3D-classification of the cryo-EM dataset resulted in a

166

3.20 Å resolution reconstruction showing three DH1047 Fab bound to each of the 3 RBD of the

167

ectodomain in the “up” position (1 Fab:1 RBD ratio) (Fig. 3, Figure S5 and Table S3). Similar to

168

what we had observed for the DH1047 complex with the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain

169

there was considerable heterogeneity in the RBD region; further classification of particles was

170

performed to better resolve the antibody binding interface, resulting in an asymmetric

171

reconstruction of a population refined to a resolution of 3.4 Å that was used for model fitting.

172

The angle of approach and footprint of DH1047 on the SARS-CoV RBD closely resembled that

173

in the SARS-CoV-2 complex with steric overlap predicted with ACE2 binding (Figure 3A-C).

174

These results demonstrate that DH1047 binds to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike

175

ectodomains by involving homologous interactions, consistent with our analysis of RBD

176

sequence variability that showed a high degree of convergence of the DH1047 epitope 10, thereby

177

defining an RBD conserved site of vulnerability among Sarbecoviruses. The DH1047 epitope on

178

the SARS-CoV-2 RBD is distinct from other known antibodies of Classes 1, 2, 3 and 4 (Figure

179

3D). The DH1047 epitope overlays with that of antibody ADG-2, yet the two epitopes are

180

distinct, and related by a rotation about the Fab longitudinal axis that pivots the ADG-2 antibody

181

more towards the ACE2 binding region (Figures 3D and S6). Finally, we defined the binding

182

affinity of DH1047 against epidemic and zoonotic spike proteins. We measured binding on and

183

off rates against both SARS-CoV and RsSHC014-CoV spike proteins via surface plasmon

185

affinity, association rates (> 8.60 X104 M-1s-1) and dissociation rates (< 1.0X10-5 s-1) (Fig. S4),

186

demonstrating that DH1047 binds tightly to both the epidemic SARS-CoV and pre-emergent bat

187

CoVs that are poised for human emergence.

188
189

The prophylactic and therapeutic activity of DH1047 against bat pre-emergent CoVs and

190

in vitro neutralization activity against the SARS-CoV-2 variants

191

As DH1047 neutralized both the pre-emergent bat CoVs WIV-1 and RsSHC014 (Fig. 1),

192

we sought to define if DH1047 had prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in mice. We evaluated

193

the protective efficacy against lung viral replication against these pre-emergent bat CoVs. We

194

administered DH1047 prophylactically 12 hours before infection and therapeutically 12 hours

195

post infection at 10mg/kg in mice infected with bat CoVs. Importantly, the prophylactic

196

administration of DH1047 completely protected mice from WIV-1 lung viral replication and

197

reduced lung viral titers in therapeutically treated mice compared to control mice (Fig. 4A).

198

Similarly, the prophylactic administration of DH1047 completely protected mice from

199

RsSHC014 lung viral replication and significantly reduced viral replication to near undetectable

200

levels in therapeutically treated mice (Fig. 4B). While we previously demonstrated the

201

prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of DH1047 against the wild type SARS-CoV-2 in

202

cynomolgus macaques 16, which exhibit mild SARS-CoV-2 disease 20, it was not known if the

203

mutations present in the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants would ablate the neutralizing

204

activity of DH1047. We therefore evaluated if DH1047 could neutralize the prevalent variants of

205

concern (VOCs): SARS-CoV-2 D614G, SARS-CoV-2 UK B.1.1.7., SARS-CoV-2 California

206

B1.429, and SARS-CoV South Africa B1.351 using both pseudovirus and live virus

207

neutralization assays. DH1047 neutralized all tested variants of concern with substantial potency

208

(Fig. 4C and Fig. 4D). Pseudovirus neutralization assays revealed strong neutralization of

209

DH1047 against the SARS-CoV-2 VOCs (Fig. 4D). Importantly, live virus neutralization also

210

demonstrated the broadly neutralizing activity of DH1047 with IC50 values against D614G,

211

B.1.1.7, and B1.351 were 0.059, 0.081, and 0.111µg/ml, respectively.

212
213
214

The prophylactic and therapeutic activity of DH1047 against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 in mice
Given that the B.1.351 South African variant is more resistant to both vaccine-elicited

215

neutralizing antibodies 14,21, and completely ablates the neutralizing activity of the Eli Lily

216

therapeutic monoclonal antibody LY-CoV555 12, we also sought to evaluate if DH1047 had both

217

prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351, which incorporates the

218

B.1.351 spike in the SARS-CoV MA10 genome backbone 22. We again utilized a highly

219

susceptible and vulnerable aged mouse model in the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 protection

220

experiments. Consistent with the SARS-CoV, WIV-1, and RsSHC014 in vivo data, the

221

prophylactic administration of DH1047 mediated protection against severe weight loss following

222

SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 challenge in aged mice (Fig. 5A). In contrast, we did not observe

223

differences in weight loss from the therapeutic administration of DH1047 (Fig. 5A). Mice

224

prophylactically treated with DH1047 had undetectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 lung

225

viral replication (Fig. 5B) and were also completely protected from macroscopic lung pathology

226

compared to controls (Fig. 5C). While we observed no significant protection from weight loss in

227

DH1047 therapeutically treated mice, we did observe a significant reduction in lung viral titers

228

compared to control (Fig. 5B). We also evaluated the microscopic lung pathology as measured

229

by ALI (Fig. 5D) and DAD scoring schemes (Fig. 5E) in this highly susceptible aged model for

230

SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 pathogenesis. Importantly, the prophylactic administration of DH1047

231

significantly protected mice from lung histopathology as measured by ALI and DAD compared

232

to control mice. Additionally, we observed a reduction in ALI by the therapeutic administration

233

of DH1047 as measure by macroscopic lung pathology (Fig. 5C) and lung histopathology by

234

ALI (Fig. 5D). Therefore, DH1047 can prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infections with the

235

B.1.351 variant of concern in vivo, especially if given early in infection.

Discussion

238

The emergence of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in the last two decades underscores a

239

critical need to develop broadly effective countermeasures against Sarbecoviruses. Moreover,

240

with the recent emergence of more highly transmissible 23, virulent 24, and neutralization resistant

241

UK B.1.1.7 variant, that can partially evade existing countermeasures 12,14, there is a need to

242

develop next-generation mAb therapeutics that can broadly neutralize these variants, as well as

243

future variants of concern. For example, the SARS-CoV-2 South African B.1.351 variant

244

completely ablates the neutralization activity of the mAb LY-CoV555 12,13. As a result, the

245

emergency use authorization (EUA) of LY-CoV555 was recently rescinded by the U.S. Food and

246

Drug Administration (FDA). In addition, the presence of the E484K mutation in many variants

247

of concern, severely dampens the neutralization activity by more than 6-fold of the AstraZeneca

248

COV2-2196 mAb, Brii BioSciences mAb Brii-198, and the Regeneron mAb REGN 10933

249

13,14,19

250

including B.1.351 can diminish the efficacy of clinically approved vaccines, including the

251

Johnson & Johnson single-dose vaccine and the AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 25,26. Furthermore, some

252

monoclonal antibodies isolated from vaccine recipients of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines also

. In addition to evading currently monoclonal antibody therapeutics, some of the variants

253

demonstrated reduced efficacy against mutations present in the variants 27. Therefore, current

254

vaccine and mAb therapies must be monitored in real time to define the performance of existing

255

therapies against newly emerging and spreading variants. In the setting of reduced vaccine

256

efficacy, the deployment of effective mAb therapies against the variants, such as DH1047, could

257

be a strategy to help control the COVID-19 pandemic.

258

The development of universal vaccination strategies against Sarbecoviruses will be

259

improved by the identification and characterization of broadly protective and conserved epitopes

260

across SARS-like virus strains. Recent studies described broadly reactive antibodies that target

261

the subunit 2 (S2) portion of the spike protein 28-31. While the broad recognition of these S2-

262

specific antibodies is encouraging, these antibodies weakly neutralized diverse CoVs. Given the

263

limited characterization of these mAbs, it is unclear if these S2-specific mAbs are broadly

264

protective in vivo against diverse epidemic and zoonotic pre-emergent CoVs. In contrast, RBD-

265

specific antibody, S2X259, neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants and zoonotic SARS-like viruses,

266

as measured by pseudovirus neutralization32. Similarly, a recent subset of RBD-specific cross-

267

reactive mAbs also showed in vitro activity 33, although their in vivo breadth and protective

268

efficacy remains unconfirmed. It is interesting that DH1235, DH1073, and DH1046 neutralized

269

SARS-CoV but did not protect against SARS-CoV challenge in vivo. Perhaps DH1235, DH1073,

270

and DH1046 require 1) non-neutralizing functions for protecting against infection in vivo, or 2)

271

have a distinct mode or angle of binding to SARS-CoV compared to DH1047 required for the

272

observed protection. This underlines the importance of performing in vivo protection studies in

273

addition to in vitro neutralization assays to truly define the protective efficacy of panCoV-

274

specific mAbs.

275

In contrast to ADG-2 which uses VH3-21 for its heavy chain and has a 17 amino acid

276

long HCDR3, DH1047 uses VH1-46 and has a 24 amino acid long HCDR3 (Table S2) 15.

277

Moreover, ADG-2 and DH1047 have overlapping, yet distinct binding footprints, targeting a

278

conserved region on the RBD (Fig. S6). In addition, the DH1047 epitope is distinct to those from

279

cross-reactive antibodies S309 and CR3022 (Fig. 3D) and targets an epitope near those from

280

class 4 antibodies. DH1047 had broad protective in vivo efficacy against pre-emergent SARS-

281

like viruses, epidemic SARS-CoV, and the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant, underscoring that

282

DH1047 recognizes a pan Sarbecovirus neutralizing epitope. Consistent with this notion, we

283

have described a SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ferritin nanoparticle vaccine that elicited neutralizing

284

antibodies against pre-emergent SARS-like viruses and protected against SARS-CoV-2

285

challenge in monkeys 10. The serum antibody responses in these SARS-CoV-2 RBD-ferritin

286

nanoparticle-vaccinated monkeys could block DH1047 binding responses against SARS-CoV-2

287

spike proteins, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 RBD vaccines elicit DH1047-like antibody

288

responses and could potentially protect against the future emergence of SARS- or SARS2-like

289

viruses.

290

Moving forward, it will be critical to closely monitor SARS- and SARS2-like viruses of

291

zoonotic origin and actively monitor if broad-spectrum antibodies like ADG-2, DH1047, and

292

S2X259 retain their inhibitory activity against pre-emergent viruses. We envision a system in

293

which broad-spectrum antibodies like DH1047 could be tested for safety in small Phase I clinical

294

trials so that in the event that a future SARS-like virus emerges, DH1047 could immediately be

295

tested in larger efficacy trials at the site of an outbreak to potentially prevent the rapid spread of

296

an emergent CoV. Moreover, given that DH1047 exhibited strong in vivo protection against the

297

SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 VOC, this mAb could be deployed as a mAb therapeutic to help control

298

the current COVID-19 pandemic. Like other therapeutic antibodies evaluated against COVID19

299

infections, our data argues that early administration will prove critical for protecting against

300

severe disease outcomes 19. We conclude that DH1047 is a broadly protective mAb that has

301

efficacy against pre-emergent, zoonotic SARS-like viruses from different clades, neutralizes

302

highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants, and protects against SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351.

Methods

324

Antibody isolation

325

Antibodies were isolated from antigen-specific single B cells as previously described

326

from an individual who had recovered from SARS-CoV-1 infection 17 years prior to

327

leukapheresis, and from a SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individual from 36 days post infection 16.

328
329
330

Measurement of CoV spike binding by ELISA
Indirect binding ELISAs were conducted in 384 well ELISA plates (Costar #3700) coated

331

with 2μg/ml antigen in 0.1M sodium bicarbonate overnight at 4°C, washed and blocked with

332

assay diluent (1XPBS containing 4% (w/v) whey protein/ 15% Normal Goat Serum/ 0.5%

333

Tween-20/ 0.05% Sodium Azide). mAbs were incubated for 60 minutes in three-fold serial

334

dilutions beginning at 100μg/ml followed by washing with PBS/0.1% Tween-20. HRP

335

conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (SouthernBiotech 1030-05) was diluted to

336

1:10,000 in assay diluent without azide, incubated at for 1 hour at room temperature, washed and

337

detected with 20µl SureBlue Reserve (KPL 53-00-03) for 15 minutes. Reactions were stopped

338

via the addition of 20µl HCL stop solution. Plates were read at 450nm. Area under the curve

339

(AUC) measurements were determined from binding of serial dilutions.

344

nanoluciferase (nLuc) and were recovered via reverse genetics as described previously 16. Virus

345

titers were measured in Vero E6 USAMRIID cells, as defined by plaque forming units (PFU) per

346

ml, in a 6-well plate format in quadruplicate biological replicates for accuracy. For the 96-well

347

neutralization assay, Vero E6 USAMRID cells were plated at 20,000 cells per well the day prior

348

in clear bottom black walled plates. Cells were inspected to ensure confluency on the day of

349

assay. mAbs were serially diluted 3-fold up to nine dilution spots at specified concentrations.

350

Serially diluted mAbs were mixed in equal volume with diluted virus. Antibody-virus and virus

351

only mixtures were then incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for one hour. Following incubation,

352

serially diluted mAbs and virus only controls were added in duplicate to the cells at 75 PFU at

353

37°C with 5% CO2. After 24 hours, cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured via

354

Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer specifications.

355

Luminescence was measured by a Spectramax M3 plate reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose,

356

CA). Virus neutralization titers were defined as the sample dilution at which a 50% reduction in

357

RLU was observed relative to the average of the virus control wells.

Surface plasmon resonance
Kinetic measurements of the DH1047 Fab binding to SARS-CoV and RsSHC014 spike

361

proteins were obtained using a Biacore S200 instrument (Cytiva, formerly GE Healthcare) in

362

HBS-EP+ 1X running buffer. The spike proteins were first captured onto a Series S Streptavidin

363

chip to a level of 300-400 for the SARS-CoV spike proteins and 850-1000RU for the RsSHC014

364

spike protein. The DH1047 Fab was diluted from 2.5 to 200nM and injected over the captured

365

CoV spike proteins using the single cycle kinetics injection type at a flow rate of 50µL/min.

366

There were five 120s injections of the Fab at increasing concentrations followed by a

367

dissociation of 600s after the final injection. After dissociation, the spike proteins were

368

regenerated from the streptavidin surface using a 30s pulse of Glycine pH1.5. Results were

369

analyzed using the Biacore S200 Evaluation software (Cytiva). A blank streptavidin surface

370

along with blank buffer binding were used for double reference subtraction to account for non-

371

specific protein binding and signal drift. Subsequent curve fitting analyses were performed using

372

a 1:1 Langmuir model with a local Rmax for the DH1047 Fab. The reported binding curves are

373

representative of 2 data sets.

375

Protein expression and purification for EM studies

376

The SARS-CoV spike ectodomain construct comprised the residues 1 to 1190 (UniProt

377

P59594-1) with proline substitutions at 968-969, a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization motif, a

378

C-terminal HRV3C protease cleavage site, a TwinStrepTag and an 8XHisTag. The construct was

379

cloned into the mammalian expression vector pαH34. The RsSHC014 spike ectodomain construct

380

was prepared similarly, except it also contained the 2P mutations that placed two consecutive

381

proline at the HR1-CH junction at residue positions 986 and 987. FreeStyle 293F cells were used

382

for the spike ectodomain production. Cells were maintained in FreeStyle 293 Expression

383

Medium (Gibco) at 37°C and 9% CO2, with agitation at 120 rpm in a 75% humidified

384

atmosphere. Transfections were performed as previously described

385

(SpeedBiosystems). 16 to 18 hours post transfection, HyClone CDM4HEK293 media (Cytiva,

386

MA) was added. On the 6th day post transfection, spike ectodomain was harvested from the

387

concentrated supernatant. The purification was performed using StrepTactin resin (IBA

388

LifeSciences) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superose 6 10/300 GL Increase

389

column (Cytiva, MA) in 2mM Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3. All steps were

Negative Stain Electron Microscopy (NSEM)
NSEM was performed as described previously

16

. Briefly, Fab-spike complexes were

399

prepared by mixing Fab and spike to give a 9:1molar ratio of Fab to spike. Following a 1-hr

400

incubation for 1 hour at 37 °C, the complex was cross-linked by diluting to a final spike

401

concentration of 0.1 mg/ml into room-temperature buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM

402

HEPES pH 7.4, 5% glycerol, and 7.5 mM glutaraldehyde and incubating for 5 minutes. Excess

403

glutaraldehyde was quenched by adding sufficient 1 M Tris pH 7.4 stock to give a final

404

concentration of 75 mM Tris and incubated for 5 minutes. Carbon-coated grids (EMS, CF300-

405

cu-UL) were glow-discharged for 20s at 15 mA, after which a 5-µl drop of quenched sample was

406

incubated on the grid for 10-15 s, blotted, and then stained with 2% uranyl formate. After air

407

drying grids were imaged with a Philips EM420 electron microscope operated at 120 kV, at

408

82,000x magnification and images captured with a 2k x 2k CCD camera at a pixel size of 4.02 Å.

409

The RELION 3.0 program was used for all negative stain image processing. Images were

410

imported, CTF-corrected with CTFFIND, and particles were picked using a spike template from

411

previous 2D class averages of spike alone. Extracted particle stacks were subjected to 2-3 rounds

412

of 2D class averaging and selection to discard junk particles and background picks. Cleaned

413

particle stacks were then subjected to 3D classification using a starting model created from a

414

bare spike model, PDB 6vsb, low-pass filtered to 30 Å. Classes that showed clearly defined Fabs

415

were selected for final refinements followed by automatic filtering and B-factor sharpening with

416

the default Relion post-processing parameters.

Cryo-EM

419

Purified SARS-CoV-1 spike ectodomain was incubated for approximatively 2 hours with

420

a 6-fold molar equivalent of the DH1047 Fab in a final volume of 10µL. The sample

421

concentration was adjusted to ~1.5 mg/mL of spike in 2 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, and

422

0.02% NaN3. Before freezing, 0.1µL of glycerol was added to the 10µL of sample. A 2.4-µL

423

drop of protein was deposited on a Quantifoil-1.2/1.3 grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences, PA)

424

that had been glow discharged for 10 seconds using a PELCO easiGlow™ Glow Discharge

425

Cleaning System. After a 30-second incubation in >95% humidity, excess protein was blotted

426

away for 2.5 seconds before being plunge frozen into liquid ethane using a Leica EM GP2

427

CoV protection experiments. The study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations

437

for care and use of animals by the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), National

438

Institutes of Health and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of

439

University of North Carolina (UNC permit no. A-3410-01). Animals were housed in groups of

440

five and fed standard chow diets. Virus inoculations were performed under anesthesia and all

441

efforts were made to minimize animal suffering. All mice were anesthetized and infected

442

intranasally with 1 × 104 PFU/ml of SARS-CoV MA15, 1 × 104 PFU/ml of SARS-CoV-2

443

B1.351-MA10, 1 × 104 PFU/ml RsSHC014, 1 × 104 PFU/ml WIV-1, which have been described

444

previously 7,22,47. Mice were weighted daily and monitored for signs of clinical disease, and

445

selected groups were subjected to daily whole-body plethysmography. For all mouse studies,

446

groups of n=10 mice were included per arm of the study except for the hACE2-transgenic mice,

447

which included n=5 mice per group due to a limited availability of these mice. Viral titers,

448

weight loss, and histology were measured from individual mice per group.

Lung pathology scoring
Acute lung injury was quantified via two separate lung pathology scoring scales: Matute-

452

Bello and Diffuse Alveolar Damage (DAD) scoring systems. Analyses and scoring were

453

performed by a board vertified veterinary pathologist who was blinded to the treatment groups as

454

described previously 48. Lung pathology slides were read and scored at 600X total magnification.

455

The lung injury scoring system used is from the American Thoracic Society (Matute-

456

Bello) in order to help quantitate histological features of ALI observed in mouse models to relate

457

this injury to human settings. In a blinded manner, three random fields of lung tissue were

458

chosen and scored for the following: (A) neutrophils in the alveolar space (none = 0, 1–5 cells =

459

1, > 5 cells = 2), (B) neutrophils in the interstitial septa (none = 0, 1–5 cells = 1, > 5 cells = 2),

460

(C) hyaline membranes (none = 0, one membrane = 1, > 1 membrane = 2), (D) Proteinaceous

461

debris in air spaces (none = 0, one instance = 1, > 1 instance = 2), (E) alveolar septal thickening

462

(< 2x mock thickness = 0, 2–4x mock thickness = 1, > 4x mock thickness = 2). To obtain a lung

463

injury score per field, A–E scores were put into the following formula score = [(20x A) + (14 x

464

B) + (7 x C) + (7 x D) + (2 x E)]/100. This formula contains multipliers that assign varying

465

levels of importance for each phenotype of the disease state. The scores for the three fields per

466

mouse were averaged to obtain a final score ranging from 0 to and including 1. The second

467

histology scoring scale to quantify acute lung injury was adopted from a lung pathology scoring

468

system from lung RSV infection in mice 49. This lung histology scoring scale measures diffuse

469

alveolar damage (DAD). Similar to the implementation of the ATS histology scoring scale, three

470

random fields of lung tissue were scored for the following in a blinded manner: 1= absence of

471

cellular sloughing and necrosis, 2=Uncommon solitary cell sloughing and necrosis (1–2

472

foci/field), 3=multifocal (3+foci) cellular sloughing and necrosis with uncommon septal wall

473

hyalinization, or 4=multifocal ( >75% of field) cellular sloughing and necrosis with common

474

and/or prominent hyaline membranes. The scores for the three fields per mouse were averaged to

475

get a final DAD score per mouse. The microscope images were generated using an Olympus

476

Bx43 light microscope and CellSense Entry v3.1 software.

Pathologic features of acute lung injury were scored using two separate tools: the American

769

Thoracic Society Lung Injury Scoring (ATS ALI) system. Using this ATS ALI system, we

770

created an aggregate score for the following features: neutrophils in the alveolar and interstitial

771

space, hyaline membranes, proteinaceous debris filling the air spaces, and alveolar septal

772

thickening. Three randomly chosen high power (×60) fields of diseased lung were assessed per

773

mouse. Representative images are shown from vehicle and RDV-treated mice. All images were

774

taken at the same magnification. The black bar indicates 100 μm scale. (A) CH65 control
