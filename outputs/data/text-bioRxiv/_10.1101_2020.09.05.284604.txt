ABSTRACT
The dissemination of cases of the new SAR-COV-2 coronavirus represents a serious public
health problem for Latin America and Peru. For this reason, it is important to characterize
the genome of the isolates that circulate in Latin America. To characterize the complete
genome of first samples of the virus circulating in Peru, we amplified seven overlapping
segments of the viral genome by RT-PCR and sequenced using Miseq platform. The results
indicate that the genomes of the Peruvian SARS-COV-2 samples belong to the genetic
groups G and S. Likewise, a phylogenetic and MST analysis of the isolates confirm the
introduction of multiple isolates from Europe and Asia that, after border closing, were
transmitted locally in the capital and same regions of the country. These Peruvian samples
(56%) grouped into two clusters inside G clade and share B.1.1.1 lineage. The
characterization of these isolates must be considered for the use and design of diagnostic
tools, and effective treatment and vaccine formulations.

INTRODUCTION

A new coronavirus called SARS-COV-2 causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS) that currently produced a pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus of the beta
coronavirus genus that belongs to SARS-type viruses (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SLCoVZXC21) (1). These viruses usually cause mild respiratory infections in healthy adults
and more severe and sometimes fatal effects in older adults and people with comorbidities
(2). The SARS-CoV-2 virus is an enveloped virus with a 29.903 kb, positive sense, and
single-stranded RNA genome. This genome is one of the largest among RNA viruses, and
it encodes four structural proteins (E, M, N, and S), whose function is to protect the viral
genome and 16 non-structural proteins (NSP) that regulate RNA synthesis and its
processing, such as RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (NSP12) and helicase
(NSP13). Simultaneously, other proteins facilitate the function of viral enzymes, such as
NSP7 and NSP10 (3).

In December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus initially caused an outbreak of atypical
pneumonia in Wuhan, China; since then, it has spread to almost all countries in the world.
For this reason, the WHO declared it a pandemic on the 11th March, and later this new
disease was named COVID-19 (4,5). WHO ranked the COVID-19 as the sixth international
public health emergency of global concern after H1N1 (2009), Polio (2014), Ebola from West
Africa (2014), Zika (2016), and Ebola from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2019).
Thus, due to the virus´s high transmission capacity, a growing incidence of infection, and
the ability to be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers, and call on the world's health systems
to cooperate to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (6).

At the date of this publication, the COVID-19 has caused more than 16 and a half million
confirmed cases and more than 650,000 deaths worldwide. America is one of the most
affected regions by the disease, with more than 8,800,000 affected patients, where the USA
and Brazil are the most affected countries (4,263,531 and 2,442,375 confirmed cases
respectively). Peru ranks seventh among the countries with the most confirmed cases
worldwide (more than 600,000 infected) , and first place in mortality rate (more than 28 000
deaths) (8). The first Peruvian case of COVID-19 was notified on 5th March 2020 in a 25-

year-old man who arrived in the country after visiting Spain, France, and the Czech Republic.
Subsequently, new cases began to be notified in other cities of Peru in such a way that the
Peruvian government decreed the international closure of borders and mandatory
quarantine at the national level on 16th March.

To control the COVID-19 burden, it is necessary to understand the genomic structure of the
SARS-CoV-2 virus, identify new mutations associated with its transmission, and infer these
transmission routes. Knowledge of these aspects will allow the development of vaccines,
implement better disease control, and generate new diagnostic methods. In this context, our
study seeks to contribute with genomic analysis of the early transmission of SARS-CoV-2
virus circulating in the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemics in Peru.

RESULTS

We produced seven overlapping fragments of a size between 5 Kb to 6 Kb from the genome
of SARS-COV-2 by RT-PCR (Figure 1). In some cases, we also get nonspecific
amplification, eliminated during the fragment’s purification.
We submitted 34 SARS-COV-2 genome sequences from Peru to the international Global
Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database. We identified six SARS-CoV-2
genetic lineages (A2, A5, B.1, B1.1, B1.1.1, B1.5) according to GISAID and Pangolin
analysis (Table 2). Most Peruvian SARS-CoV-2 sequences here obtained were classified
as clade B.1 (38%, n = 13), and particularly within the sub-clade B.1.1.1 (29.4%, n = 10)
(Table 2).

Phylogenetic analysis
The genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus from Peru, compared to the genomes of the
viruses reported in different countries, were grouped into genetic clades G (85.3%) and S
(14.7%), probably transmitted to people returning from Europe countries (such as Spain,
Italy and Germany) and Asians countries (Taiwan). We also observed the presence of new
Peruvian genotypes of the virus in early March and early April 2020, consistent with a local
transmission (Figure 2).

The Peruvian SARS-CoV-2 grouped in clade G presents the characteristic D614G mutation
in the Spike (S) protein. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that case zero (LIM-01-2) was
closely related to cases reported between 6th and 10th March (LIM-INS-002, LIM-INS-003,
LIM-INS-004, LIM-INS-009, LIM-INS-013, and LIM-INS-014) and cases reported in April
(LIM-INS-028 and LIM-INS-031) in Lima. We named this cluster as Peruvian Cluster II (PERCII). Two genomes (LIM-INS-017 and LIM-INS-030) found in Lima were closely related to a
genome from Taiwan.

Three genomes from Ica (ICA-INS-012), Lima (LIM-INS-015), and Huánuco (HUC-INS-008),
respectively, shown closely related to a case from Spain. The LIM-INS-006, LIM-010, and
LIM-INS-016 isolates from Lima were closely related with an isolate from Germany, and with
cases reported later (end of March and April) in Lima (LIM-INS-019, LIM-INS-022, LIM-INS020, LIM-INS-033, LIM-INS-032) and Lambayeque (LAM-INS-034, LAM-INS-035, and LAMINS-038) and Ica (ICA-INS-040). These samples grouped an almost exclusive cluster
(Peruvian Cluster I or PER-CI) shared with European samples. This cluster has the B.1.1.1
or GR lineage, unlike PER-CII that has B.1 o G lineage. We noticed that inside PER-CI
cluster exists a subclade formed by samples of Lambayeque and Ica (north and south region
of Peru).

The genomes of Peruvian isolates found in clade S have the L84S mutation in the ORF8
region in common. In this clade, we observed that the isolates LIM-INS-025 (Lima) and ICAINS-039 (Ica) related to a genome reported in Chile. LIM-INS-011 and LIM-INS-024 from
Lima related to each other. Simultaneously, LIM-INS-021 from Lima related to genomes
reported in the United States.

The MST analysis results showed multiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions to Peru from people
who entered the country before the closure of international borders (16th March). We
observed the distribution of two main genotypes, the clade S that groups five genomes
corresponding to the first notified cases in Peru shortly after the border closure (LIM-INS021 and ICA-INS039), except for one case (LIM-INS-011) who entered to Peru before that
date. The clade G shows more cases (LIM-010 and LIM-01-2, LIM-INS-002, LIM-INS-003,
LIM-INS-004, LIM-INS-009, and LIM-INS-013) that entered to Peru before the border closing
date (Figure 3).

The other cases began to circulate after the border closure. These introductions gave rise
to other cases, which originated viruses with their unique mutations, generating an
autochthonous transmission of the virus.
Amino acid variations
We found various nucleotide variations in the Peruvian SARS-CoV-2 genomes compared
with the reference genome of the Wuhan strain (NC_045512), some of which suffered amino
acid changes (Table 3 and S1). We observed the C241T nucleotide variation in the 5'-UTR
region in 30 of 34 genomes.
Among the most common significant non-synonymous nucleotide variations in ORF1ab are
T1246I (10/34), G3278S (10/34), P4715L (29/35), and H5005Y (8/34). We found three
amino acid variations in the spike protein: L5F (1/34), I119V (8/34), and D614G (29/34). In
the ORF3a region, we found four amino acid variations: V13L (1/34), Q57H (2/34), W149R
(1/34), and G196V (2/34).
Some genomes present the D3G variation (9/34) in the M protein, a variation found only in
samples from the PER-CII cluster. In ORF6 we found the amino acid variation I36T (1/34).
Other variations encountered were V29L (1/34) in ORF7a and S5L (1/34) in ORF7b.

In ORF8, we found the L84S variation (5/34) , while the protein N presented the following
changes, S197L (2/34), R203K (13/34), and G204R (13/34). In this gene, we observed that
R203K, G204R, and the synonyms change 28881G>A, are characteristic of PER-CI cluster.
We do not find amino acid variations in the gene E and ORF10 (Table 3 and S1). Likewise,
we found nucleotide variations in a minority of reads in some positions of 13 sequenced
genomes that we do not observe in the final assembled genome (Table 4).

DISCUSSION

At the end of December 2019, discovering a new virus that could cause respiratory disease
in humans was announced in Wuhan-China. At that time, we all thought that the virus would
take a long time for it to spread to other continents; however, after three months, the first
case was reported in Peru, and from that time to the present, we continue with more positive
cases per day being difficult to control this pandemic.

In this context, it is necessary to research to know the genomic diversity of SARS Cov2 in
different regions of the country and share this data with scientists interested in developing
diagnostic methods and possible vaccines.

In this study, we report the main clades and genomic lineages of 34 genomes of SARSCoV-2 virus from different regions, at the beginning of the pandemics in Peru. A previous
inspection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences from South America available on GISAID
revealed that the lineage B.1 is the most prevalent (82%) SARS-CoV-2 variant circulating in
South America (23). Our results show that the B.1 lineage and its sub-lineages were also
the most prevalent in Peruvian analyzed areas (n=29, 85.3%).

Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Peru belongs to the genetic
clades G and S. Both clades entered Peru almost simultaneously according to the date of
sample collection. The first confirmed case in Peru in early march was a man infected during
their visit to European countries; this hypothesis is confirmed by both phylogenetic analysis
and the patient’s epidemiological data. Later, in late March and early April, we observed the
appearance of new cases genetically related to the first reported cases. This observation is
compatible with a local transmission since the Peruvian government decreed the closure of
borders and a state of emergency in mid of march. This same pattern of events was reported
in other countries in America (11, 23, 24).

The B1.1.1 lineage found in Peru would be responsible for most local transmission cases
and derived in two Peruvian sublineages (PER-CI and PER-CII). These sublineages present
a haplotype of two non-synonymous mutations in PER-CI (R203K and G204R), and one
synonymous mutation (28881G>A) in Nucleocapsid protein; which is similar to lineages
B.1.1.EU/BR and B.1.1.BR found in Brazil (23); and one mutation for PER-CII (D3G in M
gene) (Table S1).

We observed several mutations at different positions in the genome of circulating SARSCOV-2. It is worth highlighting the presence of the C241T (30/35) mutation in the 5 'UTR
region important for transcription and viral packaging (12, 13). The P4715L mutation (14408
C>T) in the viral polyprotein ORF1ab located in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region
(position 323 of RdRP), which could be related to the increase in the mutation rate (14). This
polymerase dynamics simulation indicates that this P4715L is a more stable RdRP variant

(15). The spike protein´s D614G mutation is related to the increase of the virus´s infectivity
and is present in 29 of the 35 genomes reported in Peru (16). Likewise, it is remarkable that
the I119V mutation (present in 8 from the 34 genomes) is present in the N-terminal domain
(NTD) of the S1 region of the spike, and we detected no variations in the RBD region.
Meanwhile, the R203K (13/34) and G204R (13/34) variants of the N gene could contribute
to the reduction of the nucleocapsid´s conformational entropy (17). ORF3a is a carrier for
K+ and Ca2+ ions (18) and is necessary for in vitro and in vivo replication (19). The Q57H
mutation detected in ORF3a could generate a constriction in the formed pore (20).

Besides, we found some viral subpopulations or quasi-species, defined by the presence of
mutations in a percentage of detected reads, consistent with that previously reported for
SARS-COV-2 (21) and influenza virus (22). These mutations that appear over time are likely
due to the virus´s adaptation to the new human host. Likely, these mutations will not fix or
generate a new variant unless these variations could improve the virus´s adaptation to its
host or increase the virus´s virulence.

An important limitation of our study is the uneven spatial and temporal sampling scheme,
most SARS-CoV-2 sequences recovered in the present study were from Lima and a few
samples of north and south regions of Peru. These sampling does not represent the viral
diversity in other regions of Peru. More accurate reconstructions of the origin and regional
spread of the clade B.1.1.1 will require a denser sampling from Peru and neighboring South
American countries, particularly during the very early phase of the epidemic. It is crucial to
analyze more cases by whole genome sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from different
regions of the country, to better understand the spread and evolution of this new coronavirus
in Perú. It is also important to integrate the information from the laboratory diagnosis and
the genomic analysis of the virus with the clinical and epidemiological data to depict the
clinical epidemiology and infection mechanisms of this coronavirus in Peru.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Nasal and pharyngeal swabs summited to the National Reference Respiratory Viruses
Laboratory of the Peruvian National Institute of Health for diagnostic confirmation were
stored at -80 °C. We selected samples from the first cases reported in Peru and from

different regions of the country. The first 34 samples, from early March to early April, were
chosen following the criteria that they had an adequate viral load (Ct ˂30) after analyzing
the molecular diagnosis results by real-time RT-PCR.
Viral RNA was purified from 140 L of viral transport medium, using the QIAamp Viral RNA
Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. The purified RNA
samples were processed by reverse transcription and PCR to amplify overlapping
fragments, using primers designed (Table 1) with the PrimerQuest Tool software
(www.idtdna.com) using the SARS-COV-2 genome from a Wuhan isolate (Genbank
accession number NC_045512. 2) and a pool of genomes reported so far. The amplification
process was done using SuperScript ™ IV One-Step RT-PCR System kit (Invitrogen) as
follows: 12.5 L of 2X amplification buffer, 1.25 L of forward primer at 10 M, 1.25 L of
reverse primer at 10 M, 4.5 L of PCR water, 0.5 L SuperScript IV / High Fidelity
polymerase and 5 L of purified RNA. The amplification program: 50 °C for 45 minutes, 98
°C for 2 minutes followed by 45 cycles of 98 °C for 10 seconds, 54 °C for 30 seconds and
68 °C for 5 minutes, finally an extension of 68 °C for 10 minutes. The amplification products
purified with the PureLink ™ PCR Purification kit (Invitrogen).

The amplified fragments (2 ng) were processed using the Nextera XT DNA Library Prep kit
and indexes adapters (Illumina) following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer.
The library was sequenced using a Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit, a MiSeq Reagent Kit
v2 cartridge (500-cycles), and the MiSeq sequencer (Illumina). The fastq files generated
were cleaned using Groomer and Trimmomatic (https://usegalaxy.org/). The reads mapped
to the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference genome available at the National Center for Biotechnology
Information (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/?term=Severe+acute+respiratory+syndrome+coronavirus
+ 2 + AND + Wuhan)

using BWA-ME (https://usegalaxy.org). Finally, the genomes were

assembled using SPAdes and compared to the reference genome using CONTIGuator
(http://contiguator.sourceforge.net/). Nucleotide and amino acid variations were detected
using snpEff (http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/SnpEff_manual.html). Likewise, a manual edition
of the genomes was done using the Geneious Prime software (https://www.geneious.com/).

The phylogenetic analysis of the genomes was done using the Bayesian Markov Chain
Monte Carlo method (MCMC) using BEAST 2 (9). The Yules demographic model and the
Log-Normal Relaxed clock were selected, running 10 MCMC chains of 10 million.
Convergence was evaluated with Tracer (https://www.beast2.org/tracer-2/), obtaining an

ESS higher than 200. The Maximum Clade Credibility (MCC) tree is generated after a 10%
burning using TreeAnnotator. The MCC tree was visualized and edited using FigTree
(http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). Additionally, to detect local transmission of the
virus we performed Maximum Likelihood analysis with 1000 bootstraps of confidence using
MEGA X (https://www.megasoftware.net). For the identification of the SARS-CoV-2
genotypes or genetic lineages, we analyzed the 34 genomes using the recently described
Pangolin 2.0 web application (http://cov-lineages.org) (10).

A minimum spanning tree (MST) analysis using BioNumerics version 7.6 (Applied Maths
NV, Sint-Maartens-Latem, Belgium) drawn evolutionary relationships between samples.
MST connects each genome based on the degree of changes required to go from one allele
to another. The MST structure is represented by branches (continuous vs. dashed and
dotted lines) and circles representing each pattern.
The length of the branches represents the distance between patterns; while the complexity
of the lines (continuous, gray dashed and gray dotted) denotes the number of SNP changes
between two patterns: solid lines, 1 or 2 or 3 changes (thicker ones indicate a single change,
while the thinner ones indicate 2 or 3 changes); gray dashed lines represent four changes;
and gray dotted lines represent five or more changes. The size of the circle is proportional
to the total number of genomes.

Figure 2. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus isolates. A) Phylogenetic tree built with
Beast 2.0. The numbers found in the clades correspond to the posterior probability of each branch.
B) Phylogenetic tree built with MEGAX using the Maximum Likelihood algorithm, the numbers in the
clades correspond to Bootstrap value. The codes of the Peruvian isolates are in red.

Figure 3. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the first 34 reported genomes. Clades S and G
are shown, each showing several introductions occurred before the border closures
(Peru11, Peru10, Peru 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, and 13). The other cases show local transmission that
began to circulate after the border closures.
