ABSTRACT
The cutting-edge technology vaccinomics is the combination of two topics immunogenetics and
immunogenomics with the knowledge of systems biology and immune profiling for designing
vaccine against infectious disease. In our present study, an epitope-based peptide vaccine against
nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus, using a combination of B cell and T cell epitope
predictions, followed by molecular docking methods are performed. Here, protein sequences of
homologous nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus are collected and conserved regions
present in them are investigated via phylogenetic study to determine the most immunogenic part
of protein. From the identified region of the target protein, the peptide sequence IRNTTNPSAR
from the region ranging from 38-47 and the sequence PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG from the positions
of 76-90 are considered as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes respectively.
Furthermore, this predicted T cell epitopes PTDTYTSVY and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG
interacted with MHC allelic proteins HLA-A*01:01 and HLA-DRB5*01:01 respectively with
the low IC50 values. These epitopes are perfectly fitted into the epitope binding grooves of alpha
helix of MHC I molecule and MHC II molecule with binding energy scores -725.0 Kcal/mole
and -786.0 Kcal/mole respectively, showing stability in MHC molecules binding. This MHC
restricted epitope PTDTYTSVY also showed a good conservancy of 50.16% in world population
coverage. This MHC I HLA-A*01:01 allele is present among 58.87% of Chinese population
also. Therefore, the epitopes IRNTTNPSAR and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG may be considered as
potential peptides for peptide-based vaccine for coronavirus after further experimental study.

Keywords: Immunoinformatics, vaccine design, Coronavirus, nonstructural protein 4 of beta

1. Introduction
According to World Health Organization, Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of RNA
viruses that cause infection ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.967422; this version posted March 2, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
(SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified
in humans. 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a coronavirus identified as the cause of an
outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China.
Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.
Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV has been transmitted from civet cats to humans
and MERS-CoV from camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals
that have not yet infected humans. Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan,
China reportedly have some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-toperson spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to
animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring. The 2019-nCoV is spreading
from person to person in China and limited spread among close contacts has been detected in
some countries outside China. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever,
cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause
pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. There is currently
no vaccine to protect against 2019-nCoV.
According to Lu et al, 2020 [1], genome sequence of 2019-nCoV is closely related (with
88% identity) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses,
bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 and genetically distinct from SARS-CoV. Two
complete virus genomes (HKU-SZ-002a and HKU-SZ-005b) are sequenced from 2019-nCoV
infected patients [2]. HKU-SZ-002a and HKU-SZ-005b differ from each other by only two
bases. One of them is a non-synonymous mutation at amino acid position 336 of non-structural
protein 4 (Ser336 for HKU-SZ-002a; Leu336 for HKU-SZ-005b). The amino acid sequence of
the N-terminal domain of Spike subunit 1 of this novel coronavirus is around 66% identical to
those of the SARS-related coronaviruses, and the core domain of the receptor binding domain of
this novel coronavirus has about 68% amino acid identity with those of the SARS-related
coronavirus. But the protein sequence of the external subdomain region of receptor binding
domain of Spike subunit 1 has only 39% identity, which might affect the choice of human
receptor and therefore the biological activity of this virus.
Coronaviruses encode large replicase polyproteins which are proteolytically processed by
viral proteases to generate mature nonstructural proteins (nsps) that form the viral replication
complex. Positive-strand RNA viruses, such as coronaviruses, can induce cellular membrane
rearrangements during replication to form replication organelles which allows efficient viral
RNA synthesis. Nonstructural Protein 4 alone induces membrane pairing in infectious bronchitis
virus [3]. Infection with coronavirus causes rearrangement in the host cell membrane to
accumulate a replication and transcription complex in which replication of the viral genome and
transcription of viral mRNA can occur. For coronaviruses, a major pathogenicity factor has now
been identified with non-structural protein 1 in a murine model of coronavirus infection [4].
Sakai et al in 2017 [5] highlighted the role of nsp4 of SARS coronavirus in viral replication. It

has been discovered that only a change in two amino acids in nsp4 protein sequence can abolish
viral replication completely. So, to prevent coronavirus infection by designing vaccine,
nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus can be selected as target protein in this study.
Prevention of viral diseases by vaccination purposes for controlled induction of
protective immune responses against viral pathogens such as small pox, hepatitis etc. Attenuated
viral vaccines can be produced by targeting essential pathogenicity factors. This study has
implicated for the rational design of live attenuated coronavirus vaccines aiming to prevent
coronavirus-induced diseases of human as well as animal origin, including the lethal severe acute
respiratory syndrome.
In this study nonstructural protein 4 has been analyzed in order to predict informative
epitopes which will help for future vaccine designing. The knowledge of peptide vaccine is used
to identify B- cell and T-cell epitopes which can induce specific immune responses [6], [7].
These designed epitopes will offer cost effective, high quality therapeutics against corona virus.
By using online algorithms in immunoinformatics, potentially active immunogenic T and B cell
epitopes for this viral protein has been identified and modelled to design possible peptide vaccine
for coronavirus infection.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Retrieval of Non-structural protein NS4 in Beta coronavirus HKU24
The protein family information of Coronavirus nonstructural protein NS4 containing 78
protein
is
retrieved
from
InterPro
database
(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/entry/InterPro/IPR005603/). To find conserved region, retrieved
sequences were aligned using Muscle tool 3.8.31 [8] where k-mer clustering is used. In the next
step a phylogenetic tree is constructed by the method known as progressive alignment. The
evolutionary divergence analysis for all 78 virus proteins are completed by forming a
phylogenetic tree using Phy ML 3.1/3.0 aLRT software [9]. Here the phylogenetic tree was
reconstructed using the maximum likelihood method. The default substitution model was
selected assuming an estimated proportional of invariant sites (of 0.008) and 4 gammadistributed rate categorized to account for rate heterogenicity across sites. The gamma shape
parameter was estimated directly from the data (gamma = 1.788). Reliability for internal branch
was assessed using the aLRT test (SH-like).
Among these proteins non-structural protein NS4, with accession number
A0A0A7UXD8, known as Beta coronavirus HKU24 (due to its Chinese origin) with length 136
is selected in FASTA format.
2.2 Protein antigenicity determination
Antigenicity of this protein is predicted by VaxiJen v 2.0, an online prediction server
[10].

2.3 Potential B cell epitope prediction
B cell epitopes are part of allergen which come in interaction with B lymphocytes to
induce immune response. Among two types of B cell epitopes, linear type of B cell epitopes is
predicted.
Various physico- chemical properties e.g. hydrophilicity, flexibility, accessibility, turns,
exposed surface, polarity and antigenic propensity of peptides chains have been estimated to
identify the locations of linear epitopes of an antigenic protein [11]. Thus, different tools from
IEDB (www.iedb.org), including the classical propensity scale methods such as Kolaskar and
Tongaonkar antigenicity scale [12], E mini surface accessibility prediction [13], Parker
hydrophilicity prediction [14], Karplus and Schulz flexibilty prediction [15], Bepipred linear
epitope prediction [16] and Chou and Fashman beta turn prediction tool [17] are used to predict
linear or continous B cell epitopes of nonstructural protein NS4 protein in coronavirus. With the
help of graphical findings and prediction scores the most probable B cell epitope of that
antigenic protein has been identified. BepiPred prediction method is a combination of Hidden
Markov model and propensity scale method to predict score and identification of B cell epitopes
of antigenic protein [16].
2.4 Potential T- cell epitope prediction
2.4.1 MHC I T cell epitope prediction
Linear T-cell epitopes for MHC-I binding for nonstructural protein NS4 protein in
coronavirus are recognized by consensus methods using various methods such as Artificial
neural network (ANN) [18], Stabilized matrix method (SMM) [19] and Scoring Matrices
Derived from Combinatorial Peptide Libraries (Comblib) from tools for MHC -I binding
prediction methods of Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) (www.iedb.org) [20] . This serverbased method forecasts the MHC class I binding predication to 26 MHC supertypes as percentile
rank. SMM algorithm of MHC-1 binding, transporter of antigenic peptides (TAP) transport
efficiency and proteasomal cleavage efficiency are also considered to determine the IC50 values
for processing prediction of epitopes by MHC-I molecules [21]. On the basis of low IC50 values,
5 best epitopes bind with specific MHC-1 molecules are elected for further evaluation.
2.4.2

MHC II T cell epitope prediction

CD4+ T-cell receptor responses against concerned nonstructural protein NS4 protein are
done by using Peptide binding to MHC class II molecules software using MHC II binding
prediction tool in IEDB analysis resource, including a consensus approach which combines NNalign, SMM-align [21] and Combinatorial library methods. For this prediction we chose thirty
HLA class II alleles from the reference set. For the predicted T-cell epitopes with low percentile
rank are identified and their IC50 values for respective alleles are determined by SMM-align
method [22].

2.5 Analysis of population coverage
Population coverage for identified T cell epitopes is assessed for world, as well as China and
Indian population with the help of IEDB population coverage calculation tool [23]. This tool
calculates the fraction of individuals predicted to reply to a specified set of epitopes with
recognized MHC restrictions. This calculation is finished considering the HLA genotypic
frequencies assuming non-linkage disequilibrium between HLA loci.
2.6 Docking study of T cell epitopes
For docking studies, the T cell epitope PTDTYTSVY (MHC I restricted) and
PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG (MHC II restricted) are selected and subjected to PEP-FOLD server
[24], [25] for 3D structure formation. To identify the molecular interactions with specific HLA
protein for respective epitopes, docking studies are performed with ClusPro 2.2 web server [26].
Cluster scores for lowest binding energy prediction are calculated using the formula-E =
0.40E_{rep} + -0.40E_{att} + 600E_{elec} + 1.00E_{DARS}. Here, repulsive, attractive,
electrostatic as well as interactions extracted from the decoys as the reference state, are
considered for structure-based pairwise potential calculation in epitope- MHC molecule docking
[27]. Modified PDB ID 4NQX for HLA-A*01:01 is used as allelic protein for docking study of T
cell epitope with MHC I restricted. Similarly, 3D structure (PDB ID 1FV1) for HLADRB5*01:01 MHC molecule is used as receptor molecule for T cell epitope docking analysis
with MHC II restriction.

3.5 Docking study of T cell epitopes
The T cell epitope 76 PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG 90 (MHC II restricted) is selected on the basis
of its interactions with large number of alleles and lowest IC50 value with HLA-DRB5*01:01
MHC II allele. Similarly, 76 PTDTYTSVY 84, restricted with MHC I allelic protein HLAA*01:01 is designated as most probable T cell epitope which is also present in conserved region
of non-structural protein NS4 of coronavirus. Docking studies are performed with these two
epitopes with human HLA-DRB5*01:01MHC II molecule and MHC I allelic protein HLAA*01:01 respectively.
Docking study of PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG epitope with HLA-DRB5*01:01, shows lowest

Discussions
At present in China and whole world, considering the emergency situation due to corona
virus infection, rapid development in vaccine design is the most argent step to prevent
pandemics. Because by using vaccine the mortality rate due to coronavirus can be controlled.
This technique is applied successfully for smallpox virus, polio virus etc. Though for some other
common viruses such as dengue virus, hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus and
coronavirus, vaccine has not been invented till now. Due to lack of definite information about
growth, replication and pathogenesis of these viruses. Therefore, computational techniques are
used for epitope mapping, which is the preliminary step for vaccine design to prevent
coronavirus infection. This study integrates several immunoinformatics and molecular docking
methods to recognize potential epitopes of non-structural protein NS4 in coronavirus.
At first, all seventy-nine non-structural protein 4 from different coronaviruses are
retrieved from InterPro database and aligned to detect conserved sequences present in them. A
phylogenetic investigation reveals a closed evolutionary relationship among these homologous
4

proteins. Non-structural protein 4 is considered as our protein of interest for vaccine design
assuming its role in viral replication during coronavirus infection and considering its antigenic
nature in human. Not only that, this selected protein has structural similarity with non-structural
protein 4 present in rat, murine coronavirus containing various strains. Therefore, the proposed
peptide-based vaccine might be effective to prevent coronavirus infection not only in human, but
also in rat, murine etc. Here, computational method for vaccine design is totally safe, rapid and
cost effective at this emergency situation, caused due to coronavirus infection.
Five potent T cell epitope having potentiality for binding with MHC molecules are
predicted. For MHC I and MHC II molecules both 9 mer and 15 mer peptide structures are
projected from IEDB recommended prediction method and modeled by peptide modeling
algorithm. The percentile rank and IC50 values with SMM/ANN method covering all MHC class
I supertypes are also analyzed. The five most effective epitopes are presented in Table 2 along
with their IC50 values.
For MHC I binding prediction scores, the peptide with the lowest percentile rank and
IC50 value, is selected for their highest affinity for that interacting MHC I allele. The T cell
epitope 76 PTDTYTSVY 84 is considered on the basis of its interaction with large number of
alleles and lowest IC50 value with HLA-A*01:01 MHC I allele. For this epitope, MHC I
processing score with that specific allele comprises proteasome score 1.25, TAP score 1.02,
MHC IC50 value is 6.7 nm. This means that this specific epitope has high affinity to MHC I
molecule during antigen presentation. Moreover that, this epitope when interacting with selective
MHC I allele shows the highest population coverage not only for Chinese population, but also
has higher population coverage compared to other epitopes, for Indian and whole world
population. Henceforth, this epitope is considered as epitope of choice for CD8 + T cells.
Likewise, presence of wider peptide binding groove in MHC II molecule than that of
MHC I, 15 mer epitopes are investigated by smm/nn/sturnilo method along with their IC50 values
and are listed in Table 3. For MHC II binding prediction method, a 15 mer T cell epitope
sequence 76 PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG 90 of non-structural protein 4, displays a percentile rank 22.0
with IC50 value 22.0 at the time of interaction with HLA-DRB5*01:01MHC II allele. This result
approves that this peptide can be selected as T cell epitope with MHC II restriction for our
protein of interest. Moreover, this T cell epitope sequence is well conserved among the nonstructural protein 4 present in different corona viruses.
B cell epitope identification method, the prediction scores for Emini surface accessibility,
Parker hydrophilicity, Chou and Fashman beta turn and Karplus and Schulz flexibility for each
residue of peptides IRNTTNPSAR, starting from sequence 38 position and ending at 47 position
of that viral antigenic protein, predicts that this is the most potent B cell epitope present in it.
Additionally, Kolarskar and Tangaonkar antigenicity prediction values, confirm our estimation.
The predicted T cell epitopes are validated by using molecular docking study. These two
epitopes are preferably fitted in the epitope binding grooves of the two MHC protein molecules
with highly negative binding energies and stabilized by H-bonds.

An important factor in vaccine design is the distribution of selected HLA allelic protein.
This distribution varies among the human population according to the population in different
geographic regions of the world. Our predicted T cell epitope, 76 PTDTYTSVY 84, bound with
MHC I HLA-A*01:01 allele, which is present among 58.87% and 45.77% of Chinese and Indian
populations respectively and 50.16% of world populations. So, it may be concluded that the
predicted T cell epitope must be specifically restricted with the predominant MHC molecule,
which is present in target population in India and China, as well as in whole world against
coronavirus.

Conclusion

Though in general most peptide-based vaccines are developed considering B cell epitopes,
in our present study both B cell and T cell epitopes, present in non-structural protein 4, are
considered for vaccine design against coronavirus. These two T cell epitopes can stimulate
immunogenic response after administration inside the human body. This immunological reaction
can prevent coronavirus infection in human as well as rat and murine, when they come in contact
with this virus in future. Since these epitopes are well restricted with MHC molecules and at the
same time, they are almost conserved among other homologous proteins. These proteins include
non-structural protein 4, obtained from novel-coronavirus infected patient in China. Thus, these
epitopes can be proceeded for further experimental verification during vaccine designing against
coronavirus infection.
