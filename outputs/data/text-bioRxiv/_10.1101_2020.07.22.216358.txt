ABSTRACT

27

An infectious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in the city of

28

Wuhan (China) in December 2019, causing a pandemic that has dramatically

29

impacted public health and socioeconomic activities worldwide. A previously

30

unknown coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-

31

CoV-2), has been identified as the causative agent of COVID-19. To date,

32

there are no United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-

33

approved vaccines or therapeutics available for the prevention or treatment of

34

SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or associated COVID-19 disease, which has

35

triggered a large influx of scientific efforts to develop countermeasures to

36

control SARS-CoV-2 spread. To contribute to these efforts, we have

37

developed an infectious cDNA clone of the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020

38

strain based on the use of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC).

39

Recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 was readily rescued by transfection of the BAC

40

into Vero E6 cells. Importantly, the BAC-derived rSARS-CoV-2 exhibited

41

growth properties and plaque sizes in cultured cells comparable to those of

42

the SARS-CoV-2 natural isolate. Likewise, rSARS-CoV-2 showed similar

43

levels of replication to that of the natural isolate in nasal turbinates and lungs

44

of infected golden Syrian hamsters. This is, to our knowledge, the first BAC

45

based reverse genetics system for the generation of infectious rSARS-CoV-2

46

that displays similar features in vivo to that of a natural viral isolate. This

47

SARS-CoV-2 BAC-based reverse genetics will facilitate studies addressing

48

several important questions in the biology of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the

49

identification of antivirals and development of vaccines for the treatment of

50

SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated COVID-19 disease.

INTRODUCTION

52

In December 2019, a previously unknown coronavirus (CoV) was isolated in

53

Wuhan (China) from a patient with respiratory disease who had possible

54

contact with wild animals (1-3). Since then, Severe Acute Respiratory

55

Syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the ethological agent responsible for

56

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been detected in 216 countries,

57

areas or territories, and it has been responsible for over 11,125,245 human

58

cases and 528,204 deaths (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-

59

coronavirus-2019). The unprecedented human health and socioeconomic

60

impact of COVID-19 rivals only that of the “Spanish flu” pandemic, which

61

occurred almost 100 years ago (4-8). To date, there are no United States (US)

62

Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prophylactics (vaccines) or

63

specific therapeutics (antivirals) available for the prevention and treatment,

64

respectively, of SARS-CoV-2-associated COVID-19 disease.

65

CoVs are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses

66

belonging to the Nidovirales order, and responsible for causing seasonal mild-

67

respiratory illness in humans (e.g. 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1). However, two

68

previous CoVs have been associated with severe illnesses and resulted in

69

significant morbidity and mortality in humans. These include Severe Acute

70

Respiratory Syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2002; and the Middle East

71

Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) in 2012 (9). Like the SARS-CoV,

72

SARS-CoV-2 genome is approximately 30,000 bases in length. Nonetheless,

73

a feature of SARS-CoV-2 that is unique among known betacoronaviruses, is

74

the presence of a furin cleavage site in the viral spike (S) glycoprotein, a

75

characteristic known to increase pathogenicity and transmissibility in other

77

viruses (10).
The ability of generating recombinant viruses using reverse genetics

78

approaches represents a powerful tool to answer important questions in the

79

biology of viral infections. It will help us to understand the mechanisms of viral

80

infection, transmission and pathogenesis, as well as to identify viral and host

81

factors and interactions that control viral cell entry, replication, assembly and

82

budding. In addition, reverse genetics facilitates the generation of

83

recombinant viruses expressing reporter genes for their use in cell-based

84

screening assays or in vivo models of infection for the rapid and easy

85

identification of prophylactic and therapeutic approaches for the treatment of

86

viral infections, as well as to generate attenuated forms of viruses for their

87

implementation as safe, immunogenic, and protective live-attenuated

88

vaccines (LAVs).

89

DNA plasmids that replicate in E. coli have been previously used for the

90

cloning of many viral genomes and generation of reverse genetics systems.

91

However, assembly of full-length cDNAs of viruses with a large vial genome in

92

E. coli is very challenging technically due to toxicity or instability, or both, of

93

sequences within the viral genome. Two recent papers have described the

94

ability to assemble the full-length genome of SARS-CoV-2 by in vitro ligation

95

(11) or homologous recombination in yeast (12) to overcome this problem.

96

However, both approaches rely on production of the full-length viral genome

97

RNA by in vitro transcription, a process that poses technical difficulties.

98

Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), which are maintained as a single

99

copy in E. coli, have been previously described to establish reverse genetic

100

system for large RNA viruses, including other CoVs (13-15). To date, the use

101

of a single BAC for the rescue of recombinant (r)SARS-CoV-2 has not been

102

yet described. In this article, we describe the development of a BAC-based

103

reverse genetics system for the recovery of rSARS-CoV-2 from transfected

104

Vero E6 cells. Importantly, our results show that rSARS-CoV-2 and the natural

105

SARS-CoV-2 isolate have similar fitness in cultured cells and replicate to

106

similar levels in a validated golden Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV-2

107

infection and associated COVID-19 disease. This is the first description of a

108

reverse genetics approach for the rescue of rSARS-CoV-2 based on the use

109

of a single BAC. This approach will facilitate studies on the biology of SARS-

110

CoV-2, as well as the identification and characterization of antivirals and the

111

development of LAVs for the control of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated

112

COVID-19 disease.

RESULTS

127

Assembly of SARS-CoV-2 genome in the BAC

128

We used a BAC-based approach, similar to the one we previously

129

described for Zika virus (ZIKV) (16-21) to assemble an infectious clone of

130

SARS-CoV-2 based on the USA-WA1/2020 strain (Fig. 1A). We selected this

131

SARS-CoV-2 strain because it was isolated from an oropharyngeal swab from

132

a patient with respiratory illness in Washington, US. The viral sequence was

133

deposited in PubMed, and the virus isolate was available from BEI

134

Resources.

135

We chemically synthesized the entire viral genome in 5 fragments that were

136

assembled in the pBeloBAC plasmid using unique restriction enzymes and

137

standard molecular biology approaches (Fig. 1B). After assembly of the 5

138

fragments, the BAC containing the entire viral genome was analyzed by

139

restriction enzyme analysis (Fig. 1C). To facilitate the assembly of the viral

140

genome and incorporate genetic tags to distinguish the rSARS-CoV-2 from

141

the natural isolate, we introduced two silent mutations in the S (21,895 nt) and

142

matrix, M (26,843 nt) viral genes that removed BstBI and MluI restriction sites,

143

respectively (Fig. 1B).

144

Rescue of rSARS-CoV-2

145

To recover rSARS-CoV-2, we used an experimental approach similar to that

146

we previously described for mammarenaviruses (22) (Fig. 2A). Vero E6 cells

147

were transfected with the SARS-CoV-2 BAC, or empty BAC as internal

148

control, and were monitored for the presence of cytopathic effect (CPE), that

149

were evident at 72 h post-transfection (Fig. 2B). Production of infectious virus

150

(designated passage 0 [P0]) by transfected cells was 3.4x105 PFU/ml (Fig.

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.22.216358; this version posted July 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

151

2C). Recovery of rSARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by detection of viral antigen in

152

fresh Vero E6 cells infected with tissue culture supernatants collected from

153

SARS-CoV-2 BAC-transfected Vero E6 cells, but not from empty BAC-

154

transfected Vero E6 cells, by immunofluorescence using a monoclonal

155

antibody against the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV that cross-react

156

with SARS-CoV-2 N (Fig. 2D).

157

Characterization of rSARS-CoV-2 In vitro

158

We first confirmed the genetic identity of the rescued rSARS-CoV-2. To that

159

end, we used total RNA isolated from rSARS-CoV-2- and SARS-CoV-2-

160

infected Vero E6 cells to amplified by RT-PCR a region in the M gene

161

(nucleotides 26,488-27,784), in which a MluI restriction site was removed from

162

the rSARS-CoV-2 cDNA via a silent mutation (Fig. 1B). As expected, the RT-

163

PCR product from SARS-CoV-2-infected cells digested with MluI yielded two

164

fragments with the size of 351 and 946 bp (Fig. 3A, bottom). In contrast, the

165

RT-PCR product from rSARS-CoV-2-infected cells was not digested with MluI

166

(Fig. 3A, bottom). We confirmed the mutation introduced in the MluI restriction

167

site in the rSARS-CoV-2 by sanger sequencing (Fig. 3B).

168

To further characterize the genetic identity of rSARS-CoV-2, we used next

169

generation sequencing (NGS) to determine the complete genome sequence

170

of natural SARS-CoV-2 isolate from BEI Resources, and the rescue rSARS-

171

CoV-2, as well as the BAC plasmid used to rescue rSARS-CoV-2. We

172

examined 4.95M, 5.79M, and 5.44M reads for the natural virus isolated, BAC

173

plasmid and rescued rSARS-CoV-2, resulting in coverages of 978x, 15,296x,

174

and 1944x per sample, respectively. Introduced variants were not present in

175

the SARS-CoV-2 but was effectively fixed in the BAC plasmid and rSARS-

176

CoV-2. We confirmed the presence of the genetic markers at positions 21,895

177

(S) and 26,843 (M) in both, the BAC plasmid and rSARS-CoV-2 (allele

178

frequencies > 99.9%). (Fig. 3C, middle and bottom).

179

Next, we compared rSARS-CoV-2 and the natural isolate of SARS-CoV-2

180

with respect their growth properties in Vero E6 cells. Both rSARS-CoV-2 and

181

SARS-CoV-2 made uniform plaques with of similar size (Fig. 3D). Likewise,

182

both rSARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 exhibited similar growth kinetics and

183

peak titers (Fig. 3E). These results confirmed the genetic identity of the

184

rSARS-CoV-2 and its ability to replicate to the same extent than SARS-CoV-2

185

natural isolate in Vero E6 cells.

186

Pathogenicity of rSARS-CoV-2 in vivo

187

Golden Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) have been shown to be a

188

good rodent animal model for investigating the replication, virulence and

189

pathogenicity of both SARS-CoV (23) and SARS-CoV-2 (24) in vivo. To

190

confirm that the rSARS-CoV-2 generated using the BAC-based reverse

191

genetics exhibited the same replication capability, virulence and pathogenicity

192

as the natural SARS-CoV-2 isolate in vivo, we infected golden Syrian

193

hamsters intranasally with 2x104 PFU of either rSARS-CoV-2 or the natural

194

SARS-CoV-2 isolate. At days 2 and 4 post-infection, we collected the nasal

195

turbinates (upper respiratory tract) and lungs (lower respiratory tract) from

196

infected animals, as well as mock-infected controls, to assess the gross

197

pathological changes (lungs) and the extent of viral replication (nasal

198

turbinates and lungs). Mild multifocal congestion and consolidation were

199

observed in 5-10% of the surface of lungs from rSARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4A, ii) and

200

SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4A, iii) infected animals at day 2 post-infection. As

201

expected, the gross pathological lesions were more pronounced at day 4

202

post-infection, with severe multifocal to locally extensive congestion and

203

consolidation (white arrows) in 40-50% of the surface of the lungs (Fig. 4A, v

204

and vi). These lesions were widely distributed covering both the right (cranial,

205

medial, and caudal lobes) and the left lobes of the lungs. Particularly, the

206

presence of frothy exudate (black arrows) in the trachea of hamsters infected

207

with either rSARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-2 on day 4 post-infection indicates an

208

ongoing bronchopneumonia. Of note, we did not observe significant

209

differences in pathological lesion in the lungs at both days post-infection

210

between animals infected with rSARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4B). Both

211

rSARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 replicated to similar levels in the lungs (Fig.

212

4C) and the nasal turbinates (Fig. 4D) of infected animals at days 2 and 4

213

post-infection, indicating that the genetically engineered rSARS-CoV-2

214

replicates to levels comparable to the natural isolate in vivo.

226

DISCUSSION

227

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, and associated COVID-19 disease, has

228

created an unprecedented public health threat to humans (25, 26). To date, no

229

FDA-approved prophylactics (vaccines) and/or therapeutics (antivirals) are

230

available for the treatment of COVID-19, which has triggered a surge of

231

scientific efforts to develop countermeasures to treat COVID-19 disease and

232

control SARS-CoV-2 infection.

233

CoVs are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with one of the

234

largest viral genomes (~30 kilobases) among RNA viruses (15). Contrary to

235

the situation with other single-stranded RNA viruses, the development of

236

reverse genetics systems to recover recombinant CoV has been challenging

237

due to toxicity or instability of viral cDNA in bacterial systems. To overcome

238

this problem, several approaches have been used to successfully generate

239

recombinant CoVs. This includes splitting of viral cDNA for propagation in

240

different plasmids before assembly of a full-length genome by in vitro ligation

241

(27), the use of homologous recombination in yeast (28), the insertion of linker

242

sequences that disrupt the viral open reading frame and removed prior to

243

transcription (29), the inactivation of cryptic promoters for bacterial RNA

244

polymerase using silent mutagenesis (30), and the use of BACs (13-15).

245

In this study, we report the development of a full-length infectious clone of

246

SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain based on the use of a BAC. This is, to

247

our knowledge, the first reverse genetics approach to generate rSARS-CoV-2

248

based on the transfection of a single BAC plasmid. The full-length cDNA copy

249

of SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 was sequentially assembled downstream of

250

a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter into the pBeloBAC11 plasmid using

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.22.216358; this version posted July 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

251

synthetic fragments. After delivery of the BAC into host cells, the CMV

252

promoter initiates the production of viral RNA from the nucleus of transfected

253

cells by the cellular RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Although we described the

254

generation of rSARS-CoV-2 from transfected Vero E6 cells, the use of the

255

CMV promoter could also be applicable for generating rSARS-CoV-2 from

256

other cell lines (31). Accordingly, we have been able to successfully rescue

257

rSARS-CoV-2 using the BAC-based approach form human 293T and HeLa

258

cells constitutively expressing the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2

259

(hACE2, data not shown).

260

The genetic identity of the rescued rSARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by

261

sequencing. Notably, the rSARS-CoV-2 replicated in Vero E6 cells to levels

262

comparable to the natural isolate as determined by growth kinetics and plaque

263

assay. Importantly, using the golden Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV-2

264

infection (24), we found that both rSARS-CoV-2 and the natural SARS-CoV-2

265

isolate have similar pathogenicity and growth capabilities in the upper and

266

lower respiratory track of infected animals.

267

In summary, we have developed, for the first time, a powerful, reliable and

268

convenient SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetics system based on the use of a BAC.

269

The use of BAC-based reverse genetics for SARS-CoV-2 represents an

270

excellent option to facilitate studies addressing a number of important

271

concepts about the biology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These include viral and

272

host factors and interactions that control viral cell entry, replication, assembly

273

and budding; the rescue of rSARS-CoV-2 with predetermined mutations in

274

their genomes to examine their contribution to viral multiplication and

275

pathogenesis; the develop of cell-based approaches to interrogate individual

276

steps in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 to identify the mechanism of action of

277

viral inhibitors; the generation of rSARS-CoV-2 expressing reporter genes for

278

their use in cell-based screening assays or possibly in vivo models for the

279

rapid and easy identification of viral inhibitors and/or neutralizing antibodies;

280

and, the generation of rSARS-CoV-2 containing mutations in their viral

281

genome that results in attenuation for their implementation as safe,

282

immunogenic, stable and protective LAVs for the treatment of COVID-19

283

disease.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

302

Biosafety

303

All the in vitro and in vivo experiments with infectious SARS-CoV-2 were

304

conducted under appropriated biosafety level (BSL) 3 and animal BSL3

305

(ABSL3) laboratories, respectively, at Texas Biomedical Research Institute

306

(Texas Biomed). Experiments were approved by the Texas Biomed

307

Institutional Biosafety (IBC) and Animal Care and Use (IACUC) committees.

308

Cells and virus

309

African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (Vero E6, CRL-1586) were

310

obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Bethesda, MD)

311

and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented

312

with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, FBS (VWR) and 100 units/ml penicillin-

313

streptomycin (Corning).

314

SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 natural isolate was obtained from BEI

315

Resources (NR-52281) and amplified on Vero E6 cells. This strain was

316

selected because it was isolated from an oropharyngeal swab from a patient

317

with respiratory illness in January 2020 in Washington, US. The SARS-CoV-2

318

USA-WA1/2020 sequence was available from Genbank (Accession No.

319

MN985325).

320

Sequencing

321

We generated short read sequencing libraries from the BAC and recovered

322

SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. For BAC sequencing, we followed the PCR-free

323

KAPA HyperPlus Kit protocol, using 500 ng of input DNA. For SARS-CoV-2

324

viral RNA sequencing, we generated libraries using KAPA RNA HyperPrep Kit

325

with a 45 min adapter ligation incubation including 6-cycle of PCR with 100 ng

326

RNA and 7 mM adapter concentration. Samples were sequenced on an

327

Illumina Hiseq X machine.

328

Raw reads were quality filtered using Trimmomatic v0.39 (32) and mapped

329

to a SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (Genbank Accession No. MN985325)

330

with Bowtie2 v2.4.1 (33). Genome coverage was quantified with MosDepth.

331

V0.2.6 (34). We genotyped each sample for low frequency variants with

332

LoFreq* v2.1.3.1 (35) and filtered sites with less than 100x read depth or

333

minor allele frequencies less than 1%. Finally, we used SnpEff v4.3t (36) to

334

identify the impact of potential variants on the protein coding regions in the

335

SARS-CoV-2 reference genome.

336

Assembly of the full-length of SARS-CoV-2 genome

337

Based on genomic information of SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 isolate

338

deposited in Genbank (Accession No. MN985325), the full-length genomic

339

sequences were divided into 5 fragments (Fig. 1), synthesized de novo by Bio

340

Basic (Ontario, Canada) and cloned into a high-copy pUC57 plasmid with

341

designated restriction sites. A BstBI site in the S gene and a MluI site in the M

342

gene were removed by silent mutation (Fig. 1). These mutations were

343

introduced to ensure these restriction sites were unique and not present in the

344

viral genome for the assembly of full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome and as

345

molecular markers to distinguish the rescued rSARS-CoV-2 from the natural

346

isolate (Fig. 3).

347

For the assembly of the entire viral genome in the BAC, fragment 1 was

348

cloned into the pBeloBAC11 plasmid (NEB) linearized by PciI and HindIII

349

digestion (Fig. 1). By using the preassigned restriction sites in fragment 1, the

350

other 4 fragments were assembled sequentially by using standard molecular

351

biology methods (Fig. 1). All the intermediate pBeloBAC11 plasmids were

352

transformed into commercial DH10B electrocompetent E. coli cells (Thermo

353

Fisher Scientific) using an electroporator (Bio-Rad) with the condition of 2.5kV,

354

600Ω and 10µF. The BAC containing the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome,

355

which had been analyzed by digestion using the restriction enzymes used to

356

clone into the pBeloBAC 11 (Fig. 1), was also confirmed by deep sequencing.

357

Rescue of rSARS-CoV-2

358

Virus rescue experiments were performed as previously described (19).

359

Briefly, confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells (106 cells/well, 6-well plates,

360

triplicates) were transfected, using LPF2000, with 4.0 μg/well of SARS-CoV-2

361

BAC, or empty BAC as internal control. After 24 h, transfection media was

362

exchanged for post-infection media (DMEM supplemented with 2% (v/v)

363

FBS), and cells were split and seeded into T75 flasks 48 h post-transfection.

364

After incubation for another 72 h, tissue culture supernatants were collected,

365

labeled as P0 and stored at -80°C. The P0 virus was used to infect fresh Vero

366

E6 cells (106 cells/well, 6-well plates, triplicates) (1 ml/well) for 48 h, and then

367

cells were fixed and assessed for the presence of virus by

368

immunofluorescence. After confirmation of the rescue, the P0 virus was

369

subjected to 3 rounds of plaque purification a new virus stock (P3) was made

370

and titrated for further in vitro and/or in vivo experiments.

371

Immunofluorescence assay (IFA)

372

Vero E6 cells (106 cells/well, 6-well plate format, triplicates) were mock-

373

infected or infected (multiplicity of infection, MOI=0.01) with the natural USA-

374

WA1/2020 isolate or rSARS-CoV-2. At 48 h post-infection, cells were fixed

375

with 10% formaldehyde solution at 4°C overnight and permeabilized using

376

0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were

377

incubated overnight with 1 μg/ml of a SARS-CoV cross-reactive N monoclonal

378

antibody 1C7 at 4°C, washed with PBS, and stained with a FITC-labeled goat

379

anti-mouse IgG (1:200). After washing with PBS, cells were visualized and

380

imaged under a fluorescent microscope (Olympus).

381

Plaque assay and immunostaining

382

Confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells (106 cells/well, 6-well plate format,

383

triplicates) were infected with ~20 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 or

384

rSARS-CoV-2 for 1 h at 37°C. After viral adsorption, cells were overlaid with

385

post-infection media containing 1% low melting agar and incubated at 37°C.

386

At 72 h post-infection, cells were fixed overnight with 10% formaldehyde

387

solution. For immunostaining, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% (v/v) Triton

388

X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature and immunostained using the N

389

1C7 monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml) and the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector

390

Laboratories), following the manufacturers’ instruction. After immunostaining,

391

plates were scanned and photographed using a scanner (EPSON).

392

Virus growth kinetics

393

Confluent monolayers of Vero E6 cells (106 cells/well, 6-well plate format,

394

triplicates) were infected (MOI=0.01) with SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 or

395

rSARS-CoV-2. After 1 h virus adsorption at 37°C, cells were washed with PBS

396

and incubated in post-infection media at 37°C. At the indicated times after

397

infection, viral titers in tissue culture supernatants were determined by plaque

398

assay and immunostaining using the N monoclonal antibody 1C7, as

399

previously described (37).

401

Total RNA from SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 or rSARS-CoV-2 infected

402

(MOI=0.01) Vero E6 cells (106 cells/well, 6-well plate format) was extracted

403

with TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the

404

manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR amplification of the viral genome

405

spanning nucleotides 26,488-27,784, was performed using Super Script II

406

Reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Expanded High Fidelity

407

PCR System (Sigma Aldrich). The amplified 1,297 RT-PCR products were

408

digested with MluI (NEB). Amplified DNA products, undigested or digested

409

with MluI were subjected to 0.7% agarose gel analysis. Gel-purified PCR

410

fragments were subjected to sanger sequencing (ACGT). All primer

411

sequences used for RT-PCR are available on request.

412

Pathogenicity studies in golden Syrian hamsters

413

Twelve-week-old female golden Syrian hamsters were purchased from

414

Charles River and maintained in the animal facility at Texas Biomed under

415

specific pathogen-free conditions. Golden Syrian hamsters were infected (1.0

416

x 104 PFU) intranasally with either the rSARS-CoV-2 or the natural USA-

417

WA1/2020 isolate in a final volume of 100 µl following gaseous sedation in an

418

isoflurane chamber. After viral infection, hamsters were humanely euthanized

419

on days 2 and 4 post-infection to collect nasal turbinates and lungs.

420

Measurement of viral loads in nasal turbinates and lungs

421

Nasal turbinates and lungs from mock-, SARS-CoV-2- and SARS-CoV-2-

422

infected golden Syrian hamsters were homogenized in 2 ml of PBS for 20 s at

423

7,000 rpm using a Precellys tissue homogenizer (Bertin Instruments). Tissue

424

homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 g (4 °C) for 5 min, and supernatants

425

were collected for the measurement of viral loads. Confluent monolayers of

426

Vero E6 cells (96-plate format, 4 x 104 cells/well, duplicate) were infected with

427

10-fold serial dilutions of the supernatants from the tissue homogenates. After

428

viral adsorption for 1 h at 37 °C, cells were washed 3 times with PBS before

429

adding fresh post-infection media containing 1% microcrystalline cellulose

430

(Avicel, Sigma Aldrich). Cells were further incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Plates

431

were then inactivated in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Thermo Fisher

432

Scientific) for 24 h. For immunostaining, cells were washed three times with

433

PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room

434

temperature. Then, cells were blocked with 2.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA)

435

in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by incubation with 1 µg/ml of the anti-N

436

SARS-CoV monoclonal antibody 1C7 diluted in 1% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. After

437

incubation with the primary antibody, cells were washed three times with PBS,

438

counterstained with the Vectastain ABC kit, and developed using the DAB

439

Peroxidase Substrate kit (Vector Laboratory, Inc, CA, USA) according to the

440

manufacturers’ instructions. Virus titers are indicated as PFU/ml.

441

Evaluation of lung pathological lesions

442

Macroscopic pathology scoring was evaluated using ImageJ software to

443

determine the percent of the total surface area of the lung (dorsal and ventral

444

view) affected by consolidation, congestion, and atelectasis, as previously

445

described (38).

446

Statistical analysis

447

Data representative of three independent experiments in triplicates have

448

been used. All data represent the mean ± standard deviation (SD) for each

449

group and analyzed by SPSS13.0 (IBM). A two-tailed Student’s t-test was

FIGURE LEGENDS

651

Figure 1. Assembly of SARS-CoV-2 genome into a BAC. A) Schematic

652

representation of SARS-CoV-2 genome: The indicated restriction sites were

653

used for cloning the entire viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) of SARS-CoV-2,

654

USA-WA1/2020 strain, into the pBeloBAC11 plasmid. The open reading

655

frames of the viral 1a, 1b, spike (S), envelop (E), matrix (M) and nucleocapsid

656

(N) structural and the accessory (3a, 6, 7a, 7b, 8 and 10) proteins are also

657

indicated. UTR, untranslated regions. Length is not in scale. B-C) Assembly

658

of the viral genome: The full-length infectious cDNA clone was assembled

659

by sequentially cloning the chemically synthesized fragments 1 to 5 covering

660

the entire viral genome into the pBeloBAC11 plasmid, using the indicated

661

restriction sites, under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and

662

flanked at the 3’ end by the Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV) Ribozyme (Rz) and

663

the bovine growth hormone (bGH) termination and polyadenylation

664

sequences (B). The length of each of the chemically synthesized viral

665

fragments is indicated. Ori2 indicates the origin of the replication of BAC.

666

SopA, sopB and sopC are the elements to ensure each bacterial cell gets a

667

copy of the BAC. CmR indicates chloramphenicol resistance. After assembly,

668

the BAC clone harboring the entire viral genome was digested with the

669

indicated restriction enzymes (top) and DNA products were analyzed in a

670

0.5% agarose gel (C).

Figure 2. Rescue of rSARS-CoV-2. A) Schematic representation of the

672

approach followed to rescue rSARS-CoV-2: Vero E6 cells (6-well plates,

673

106 cells/well, triplicates) were transiently transfected with the SARS-CoV-2

674

BAC at day 1. After 24 h, transfection media was changed by post-infection

675

media. At day 4, cells were split into T75 flask and the tissue culture

676

supernatant was used to infect fresh Vero E6 cells (6-well plates, 106

677

cells/well, triplicates). At 48 h post-infection, Vero E6 cells were fixed for

678

detection of rSARS-CoV-2 by immunofluorescence and the tissue culture

679

supernatant of the scaled-up Vero E6 cells was collected at 72 h. As internal

680

control for this experiment, Vero E6 cells were transfected with the empty

681

BAC. B) CPE: Images of empty or SARS-CoV-2 BACs transfected Vero E6

682

cells at 72 h post-transfection. Scale bars, 100 μm. C) Viral titers: Tissue

683

culture supernatant from mock (empty BAC) or transfected Vero E6 cells in

684

T75 flask was collected and titrated by immunofluorescence. Data were

685

presented in mean ± SD. LOD: limit of detection. D) IFA: Vero E6 cells (6-well

686

plate format, 106 cells/well) infected with the tissue culture supernatants from

687

transfected Vero E6 cells were fixed at 48 h post-infection and viral detection

688

was carried out by using a SARS-CoV cross-reactive monoclonal antibody

689

(1C7) against the N protein (green). Cellular nuclei were stained by DAPI

690

(blue). Scale bars, 100 μm.

Figure 3. Characterization of rSARS2-CoV-2 in vitro. A-B) Genotypic

692

characterization: Vero E6 cells (6-well plate, 106 cells/well, triplicates) were

693

mock-infected or infected (MOI 0.01) with rSARS-CoV-2 or the SARS-CoV-2

694

USA-WA1/2020 natural isolate. After 1 h viral adsorption at 37°C, Vero E6

695

cells were washed 3 times with PBS and incubated in post-infection media at

696

37°C. At 24 h post-infection, total RNA from Vero E6 cells was extracted and a

697

1,297 bp region of the M gene (nt 26,488 to 27,784) was amplified by RT-

698

PCR. Amplified DNA was subjected to MluI digestion (Figure 1). Undigested

699

(top) and digested (bottom) samples were separated in a 0.7% agarose gel

700

(A). The RT-PCR amplified DNA product was also sequenced to verify the

701

presence of the silent mutation in the MluI restriction site introduced in the

702

viral genome of the rSARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1). The MluI restriction site is

703

underlined in red and the silent mutation introduced to remove the MluI

704

restriction site (T to A) is shown in the black box (B). C) Verification of BAC

705

and rSARS-CoV-2 sequences: The SARS-CoV-2 non-reference allele

706

frequency was calculated by comparing short reads to the reference genome

707

of USA-WA1/2020 reference. All variants were at low frequency in P6 natural

708

isolate (top), BAC (bottom), and rSARS-CoV-2 (middle) with the exception of

709

introduced variants at positions 21,895 and 26,843, which were fixed in the

710

BAC and rSARS-CoV-2 virus. Non-reference alleles present in less than 1%

711

of reads are not shown. D) Plaque phenotype: Vero E6 cells (6-well plate,

712

106 cells/well, triplicates) were infected with ~20 PFU of rSARS-CoV-2 (left) or

713

the natural SARS-CoV-2 isolate (right) for 1h at 37°C. After viral adsorption,

714

cells were washed 3 times with PBS and overlaid with 2 ml of post-infection

715

media containing 1% agar. After 72 h incubation at 37°C, cells were fixed and

716

immunostained with the N protein 1C7 monoclonal antibody. D) Growth

717

kinetics: Vero E6 cells (6-well plate, 106 cells/well, triplicates) were infected

718

(MOI 0.01) with rSARS-CoV-2 or the natural SARS-CoV-2 isolate for 1h at

719

37°C. After viral adsorption, cells were washed 3 times with PBS and

720

incubated in 2 ml of post-infection media. At the indicated times post-infection,

721

tissue culture supernatants were collected and viral titers were assessed by

722

plaque assay (PFU/ml). Data were presented in mean ± SD. LOD: limit of

723

detection.

Figure 4. Pathogenicity of rescued rSARS-CoV-2 in vivo: Golden Syrian

725

hamsters were mock-infected (n=2) or infected (n=6) with 2X104 PFU of

726

rSARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-2. A) Gross pathological lung lesions:

727

Animals were euthanized at 2 and 4 days post-infection, and lungs from

728

mock-infected or infected (rSARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2) animals were

729

observed for gross pathological changes, including congestion and atelectasis

730

(white arrows) and frothy trachea exudates (black arrows). Scale bars, 1

731

cm. B) Macroscopic pathology scoring analysis: Distributions of

732

pathological lesions, including consolidation, congestion, and atelectasis,

733

were measured using ImageJ and represented as the percent of the total lung

734

surface area (%). Ns, not significant. C-D) Virus titers: Viral titers in the lungs

735

(C) and nasal turbinates (D) of rSARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 infected

736

golden Syrian hamsters were determined at days 2 and 4 post-infection

737

(n=3/time point). Data represents the mean ± SD. Ns, not significant.
