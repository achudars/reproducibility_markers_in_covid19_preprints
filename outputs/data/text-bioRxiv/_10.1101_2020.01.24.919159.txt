ABSTRACT

13

The outbreak of pneumonia originating in Wuhan, China, has generated 830 confirmed

14

cases, including 26 deaths, as of 24 January 2020. The virus (2019-nCoV) has spread

15

elsewhere in China and to other countries, including South Korea, Thailand, Japan and

16

USA. Fortunately, there has not yet been evidence of sustained human-to-human

17

transmission outside of China. Here we assess the risk of sustained transmission

18

whenever the coronavirus arrives in other countries. Data describing the times from

19

symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47 patients infected in the current outbreak are used

20

to generate an estimate for the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained

21

human-to-human transmission. Under the assumptions that the imported case is

22

representative of the patients in China, and that the 2019-nCoV is similarly transmissible

23

to the SARS coronavirus, the probability that an imported case is followed by sustained

24

human-to-human transmission is 0.37. However, if the mean time from symptom onset to

25

hospitalisation can be halved by intense surveillance, then the probability that an imported

26

case leads to sustained transmission is only 0.005. This emphasises the importance of

27

current surveillance efforts in countries around the world, to ensure that the ongoing

28

outbreak will not become a large global epidemic.

1. INTRODUCTION

35
36

The infectious agent driving the ongoing pneumonia outbreak (the 2019-nCoV) appears

37

to have transitioned from animals into humans at Huanan seafood wholesale market in

38

Wuhan, China [1–5]. Since then, cases have been recorded in other countries, and initial

39

estimates suggest a case fatality rate of around 14% [6]. Even countries without

40

confirmed cases are on high alert. For example, the United Kingdom has not yet seen a

41

confirmed case, but officials are reported to be attempting to trace as many as 2,000

42

visitors that have travelled to that country from Wuhan.

43
44

The most devastating infectious disease outbreaks are those that have a wide

45

geographical distribution, as opposed to being confined to a small region [7,8]. The

46

previously known virus that is most similar to the 2019-nCoV is the SARS coronavirus [9],

47

which generated cases in 37 countries in 2002-03 [9,10]. Since the 2019-nCoV is clearly

48

capable of being transmitted by infected hosts to countries around the world, an important

49

question for policy makers is whether or not these imported cases have the potential to

50

generate sustained human-to-human transmission in new locations.

51
52

Here, we present data describing the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation for 47

53

patients from the current outbreak, obtained from publicly available line lists [11]. We fit

54

an exponential distribution to these data, accounting for uncertainty due to the limited

55

numbers of patients from whom data were available. Assuming that this distribution

56

characterises the time spent by infected hosts generating new transmissions in the

57

community, it is then possible to infer the probability that a case arriving in a new location

58

is followed by an outbreak driven by sustained human-to-human transmission. We

59

estimate this probability under the assumption that the transmissibility of the 2019-nCoV

60

is similar to that of the SARS coronavirus, and then go on to consider the effect of

61

shortening the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation. This provides an

62

estimate of the risk that imported cases generate sustained outbreaks in new locations

63

under different surveillance levels.

2. METHODS

66
67

Time from symptom onset to hospitalisation

68
69

The distribution of times from symptom onset to hospitalisation was estimated using

70

patient data from the ongoing outbreak [11] (data are shown in Fig 1A). Since the precise

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.24.919159; this version posted January 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

available under aCC-BY-ND 4.0 International license.

71

times of symptom onset and hospitalisation on the dates concerned were unknown, we

72

converted the times from symptom onset to hospitalisation to intervals describing possible

73

time periods. For example, for a case showing symptoms on 9 January 2020, and then

74

being hospitalised on 14 January 2020, the time between symptom onset and

75

hospitalisation lies between four and six days (see e.g. [12] for a similar calculation).

76
77

We then fitted the parameter (𝛾) of an exponential distribution to these interval-censored

78

data using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). A chain of length 100,000,000 in addition

79

to a burn-in of 100,000 was used. The chain was then sampled every 100 steps, giving

80

rise to a range of n = 1,000,000 equally possible distributions for the times from symptom

81

onset to hospitalisation, each characterised by a parameter estimate 𝛾" (𝑖 = 1,2, . . . , 𝑛).

82
83

Estimating the probability of sustained transmission

84
85

The distributions of times from symptom onset to hospitalisation were used to estimate

86

the probability that an imported case will lead to sustained transmission, by assuming that

87

infections occur according to a branching process (e.g. [13–15]). In this branching

88

process, the effective reproduction number (accounting for control interventions, other

89

than intensified surveillance which we model explicitly) of the 2019-nCoV when the virus

90

arrives in a new location is denoted by 𝑅 = 𝛽/𝛾, where the parameter 𝛽 represents

91

pathogen transmissibility [16]. We assumed that the transmissibility of the virus is similar

92

to that of the SARS coronavirus, i.e. 𝛽 = 𝑅-./- 𝛾-./- , where 𝑅-./- = 3 [17] and the mean

93

infection duration for SARS is 1/𝛾-./- = 3.8 days [18].

94
95

The probability of a major outbreak [15,16] can be estimated for each of the equally

96

possible distributions for the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation,
Prob(Sustained transmission|𝛾" ) = 1 −

(𝛽/𝛾" )

To include intensified surveillance in these estimates, we simply replaced the mean time

103

from symptom onset to hospitalisation for each of the equally plausible distributions, 1/𝛾" ,

104

by the modified expression (1 − 𝜌)/𝛾" . In this approximation, the parameter 𝜌 represents

105

the reduction in the mean infectious period due to intensified surveillance.

Multiple imported cases

The risk of sustained transmission given multiple imported cases was calculated by

considering the possibility that none of those cases led to sustained transmission.

116

As described in Methods, the distribution of times between symptom onset and

117

hospitalisation was estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (Fig 1B) from the patient

118

data in Fig 1A. This gave rise to a range of equally plausible distributions describing these

119

time periods (blue lines in Fig 1B). The average of these distributions is shown by the red

120

line in Fig 1B, however we used the full range of distributions in our calculations of the

121

probability of sustained transmission occurring from each imported case.

122
123

Each of the range of plausible distributions corresponded to an estimate for the probability

124

of a major epidemic (equation (1) and histogram in Fig 1C). However, the probability of

125

sustained transmission in fact takes a single value, which can be estimated by summing

126

over the range of distributions using equation (2). The resulting probability of sustained

127

transmission is 0.37 (red line in Fig 1C).

128
129

We then considered the reduction in the probability that an imported case leads to

130

sustained transmission if surveillance is more intense. Specifically, we assumed that

131

intensified surveillance led to a reduction in the mean period from symptom onset to

132

hospitalisation, governed by the parameter 𝜌 (where 𝜌 = 0 corresponds to no

133

intensification of surveillance, and 𝜌 = 1 corresponds to an implausible scenario in which

134

symptomatic cases are hospitalised immediately). We found that, if surveillance is

135

intensified so that the mean time from symptom onset to hospitalisation is halved, the

136

probability that each imported case leads to sustained transmission is reduced to only

137

0.005 (Fig 1D).

139

Finally, we considered the combined effect if multiple cases arrive in a new location. In

140

that scenario, intense surveillance has the potential to significantly reduce the risk of

141

sustained transmission compared to weak surveillance. For 𝜌 = 0.5, the probability that

142

any of 10 imported cases generate a substantial outbreak is only 0.049 (Fig 2C). This

143

highlights the importance of rigorous surveillance, particularly in locations where infected

144

hosts are most likely to travel.

4. DISCUSSION

167
168

There are concerns that the ongoing outbreak driven by 2019-nCoV could spread globally

169

[3,5,19,20] with sustained transmission in countries around the world. In the near future,

170

Chinese New Year presents a significant challenge, since this period often involves high

171

travel rates, potentially leading to importations of the virus to many new locations [3,9].

172
173

Here, we have estimated the potential for cases arriving in new locations to lead to

174

sustained transmission. According to the basic model that we have constructed, if

175

surveillance levels are similar to those in China at the beginning of the current outbreak,

176

and if this virus is similarly transmissible to the SARS coronavirus that spread globally in

177

2002-03, then the probability that each imported infected case generates an outbreak due

178

to sustained transmission is approximately 0.37 (Fig 1C). However, under a higher level

179

of surveillance, the risk of sustained outbreaks is substantially lower (Fig 1D). This result

180

is particularly striking when multiple cases travel to a new location, either simultaneously

181

or in sequence (Fig 2). In that scenario, intensified surveillance is particularly important.

182
183

Our study involves the simplest possible model that permits the risk of sustained

184

transmission to be estimated from the very limited data that have been collected in this

185

outbreak until now. As additional information becomes available, for example data

186

describing virus transmissibility, then it will be possible to estimate the risk of outbreaks

187

in new locations with more precision. We made the assumption that symptom appearance

188

coincides with the onset of infectiousness. One of the features of the SARS outbreak in

189

2002-03 that allowed it to eventually be brought under control was the low proportion of

190

onward transmissions occurring either prior to symptoms or from asymptomatic infectious

191

hosts [21]. It might be hoped that infections due to 2019-nCoV share this characteristic.

192
193

Since our results were obtained using patient data from early in the ongoing outbreak,

194

surveillance systems may not have been fully established when these data were

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.24.919159; this version posted January 25, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

195

collected, and patients may not have been primed to respond quickly to early symptoms.

196

Our results might therefore be viewed as an upper bound on the risk posed by the 2019-

197

nCoV. As the outbreak continues, it might be expected that the time from symptom onset

198

to hospitalisation will decrease, leading to lower risks of sustained transmission, as has

199

been observed for outbreaks of other diseases (e.g. the ongoing outbreak of Ebola virus

200

disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo).

201
202

Going forwards, it will be possible to include additional realism in the model. One example

203

might be to consider spatial variation in host population densities and surveillance levels,

204

leading to spatially inhomogeneous outbreak risks. It would also be possible to

205

differentiate between mild and severe cases in the model. On the one hand, a mild case

206

might be more likely to go unnoticed than a severe case, potentially leading to a higher

207

outbreak risk. On the other hand, mild infections may generate fewer secondary cases

208

than severe infections, thereby decreasing the outbreak risk. Complex interactions may

209

therefore affect the risk of sustained transmission in an unpredictable fashion.

210
211

Despite the necessary simplifications made in this study, our analyses are sufficient to

212

demonstrate the key principle that rigorous surveillance is important to minimise the risk

213

of the 2019-nCoV generating large outbreaks in countries worldwide. We therefore

214

support the ongoing work of the World Health Organization and policy makers from

215

around the world, who are working with researchers and public health experts to manage

216

this outbreak [2]. We also applaud efforts to make data publicly available [11]. Careful
