Abstract

27

SARS-CoV-2 contains a PRRA polybasic cleavage motif considered critical for efficient

28

infection and transmission in humans. We previously reported that virus variants with spike

29

protein S1/S2 junction deletions spanning this motif are attenuated. Here we characterize a

30

further cell-adapted SARS-CoV-2 variant, Ca-DelMut. Ca-DelMut replicates more efficiently

31

than wild type or parental virus in cells, but causes no apparent disease in hamsters, despite

32

replicating in respiratory tissues. Unlike wild type virus, Ca-DelMut does not induce

33

proinflammatory cytokines in hamster infections, but still triggers a strong neutralizing

34

antibody response. Ca-DelMut-immunized hamsters challenged with wild type SARS-CoV-2

35

are fully protected, demonstrating sterilizing immunity.

36

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, a novel zoonotic origin Î²-coronavirus, has led to the
1,2

37

first documented pandemic caused by a coronavirus

38

globally in humans with rapidly increasing numbers of infections and casualties each day

39

(https://coronavirus. jhu.edu/map.html). While coronaviruses from bats and pangolins have

40

been found to be closely related to SARS-CoV-2 3-6, the direct ancestral virus which attained

41

cross-species transmission and the intermediate animal host source of human infections have

42

not been defined. In the past two decades, three coronaviruses have jumped the species

43

barrier to infect humans 7. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV show limited human to human

44

transmission ability while causing severe disease and mortality. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2,

45

which uses the same human ACE2 binding receptor as SARS-CoV 6, is highly transmissible

46

and causes variable severity of disease, from asymptomatic infections to severe and fatal

47

outcomes. Analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 genome reveals a distinct PRRA polybasic cleavage

48

motif at the S1/S2 junction of the spike protein when compared to the most proximal animal

49

coronaviruses yet detected

50

protease furin promotes cell fusion mediated by S2, which is critical for cellular entry of

51

coronavirus9 10. In avian influenza virus, acquisition of a polybasic cleavage motif facilitates

52

infection of an increased variety of cell types

53

for infection of human lung cells 14. It is speculated that acquisition of the PRRA polybasic

54

motif in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 provides the virus with its unique ability of cross

55

species transmission; this motif therefore appears to serve as a pathogenic element in human

56

infections 10,14. If the PRRA polybasic cleavage motif was not a natural functional component

57

in the original virus and acquired after cross species transmission, it is postulated that it may

58

not be stable during the infection of its new hosts, or may need further adaptation. Indeed, a

59

panel of SARS-CoV-2 variants with various lengths of deletion spanning the PRRA

60

polybasic cleavage motif at the spike protein S1/S2 junction were identified in cultured cells

61

and at low levels in clinical specimens, suggesting the S1/S2 junction may be under selection

62

pressure as the SARS-CoV-2 virus circulates in humans

63

that deletion at the S1/S2 junction causes SARS-CoV-2 virus attenuation in hamsters and

64

prompted a further study to understand the properties of these deletion mutants in in vitro and

65

in vivo systems. It remains to be determined whether some of these deletion variants may

66

become more prevalent in humans as their circulation continues. On the other hand, these

67

attenuated SARS-CoV-2 variants may hold promise as candidate live vaccines and it is

68

important that their potential in this regard be evaluated.

. Initial characterization revealed

69

To understand the role of the polybasic cleavage site in the infection and replication

70

of SARS-CoV-2 and determine the stability of deletion variants, a previously characterized

71

deletion mutant 15, Del-Mut-1, was further adapted in Vero cells to obtain a highly attenuated

72

variant of SARS-CoV-2 virus, designated Ca-DelMut. We analyzed the growth properties of

73

this variant in cells and evaluated its pathogenicity in a hamster model. While it is attenuated

74

in the ability to cause disease in animals, Ca-DelMut replicates to a higher titer in Vero cells

75

than the wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus. High titers of neutralizing antibodies were detected in

76

animals previously infected with Ca-DelMut variant. However, infection with Ca-DelMut

77

does not induce the high levels of proinflammatory cytokines seen in wild type virus

78

infections. Importantly, Ca-DelMut immunized hamsters showed full protection with

79

sterilizing immunity against challenge with two different strains of wild type virus.

Results

82

Growth and pathogenic properties of Ca-DelMut in vitro and in vivo

83

We previously identified and characterized a panel of SARS-CoV-2 variants

84

containing 15-30bp deletions at the S1/S2 junction of the spike protein. One of the variants,

85

Del-Mut-1, which contains a 30bp deletion spanningthe PRRA polybasic cleavage motif was

86

shown to be attenuated in a hamster infection model

87

Vero E6 cells and obtained a variant with additional mutations in multiple genes in the

88

background of Del-Mut-1, designated Ca-DelMut (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1).

89

Growth properties of Ca-DelMut, parental Del-Mut-1 and a wild type (HK-13) SARS-CoV-2

90

were analyzed in Vero E6 and Calu-3 cells. It is interesting to note that in Vero E6 cells both

91

Del-Mut-1 and Ca-DelMut grow to a significantly higher titer at the 24 and 48-hour time

92

points than the wild type virus, with Ca-DelMut showing the strongest growth ability in both

93

cell types (Figure 2A). Notably, Ca-DelMut exhibits a cold adaptation phenotype in vitro, as

94

demonstrated by comparatively high level of replication at 30oC, whereas wild type virus

95

(HK-13) replicates poorly at this temperature (Figure S1). Attenuation of Del-Mut-1 was

96

reported previously

97

infected hamsters with variant and wild type SARS-CoV-2 strains. While inoculation with

98

103 pfu HK-13 caused significant body weight loss post-infection, no apparent body weight

99

loss was observed in Ca-DelMut (1.25x105 and 103 pfu) infected hamsters (Figure 2B).

100

Histopathological analysis showed only mild regional alveolar septal infiltration and blood

101

vessel congestion, with no obvious bronchiolar epithelium desquamation or luminal debris,

102

no alveolar space infiltration or exudation, and no pathological changes in the intestines of

103

Ca-DelMut infected hamsters, which are markedly different from the severe

104

observed in wild type virus infected animals (Figure S2). Examination of virus replication in

105

lung and nasal turbinate tissues showed that Ca-DelMut replicates actively in the nasal

106

turbinate tissues but that replication efficiency is much lower than that of HK-13 in hamster

107

lungs (Figure 2C). These results indicate that Ca-DelMut has altered tissue tropism and is

108

more likely to infect and replicate in the upper respiratory tract.

109

Immune response to infection with Ca-DelMut in hamsters

110

Impaired or dysfunctional immune responses have been characterized as an important

111

mechanism of pathogenesis in human SARS-CoV-2 infections 17-19. Research on SARS-CoV

112

and MERS-CoV has revealed that the interferon-mediated antiviral response is a double-

113

edged sword which can induce both protective and pathogenic effects in humans. How Ca-

114

DelMut infection induces the host immune response is of interest for understanding the

115

molecular basis of its attenuation. To test if infection with Ca-DelMut may induce a different

116

immune response from that elicited by wild type SARS-CoV-2, we examined interferon and

117

cytokine expression in the lung tissues of virus infected hamsters. In contrast to infection

118

with wild type HK-13 strain, we found that the Ca-DelMut variant does not provoke elevated

119

levels of cytokines in infected hamsters (Figure 3 and S3). Aberrant activation of IL6 has

120

been recognized as an important biomarker of disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infected

121

patients

122

hamsters but not in those infected with Ca-DelMut variant. We then analyzed the adaptive

123

immune response in hamsters previously infected with Ca-DelMut or wild type virus. Levels

124

of receptor binding domain (RBD) specific antibodies in sera collected three weeks after

125

infection were determined. Sera from both hamsters previously infected with Ca-DelMut or

126

that had recovered from wild type virus (HK-13)

127

RBD specific antibodies (Figure 4A and S4A). Cell based neutralization assays also

128

demonstrated strong neutralizing activity against the wild type virus strain HK-13 in sera

129

collected from both Ca-DelMut variant and wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus (HK-13) infected

130

hamsters (Figure 4B and S4B). These results indicate that infection with Ca-DelMut leads to

19-21

. Remarkably, activation of IL-6 was only observed in HK-13 strain infected

22

infection showed robust induction of

131

an altered immune response which does not induce the elevated levels of proinflammatory

132

cytokines seen in wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. Nonetheless Ca-DelMut elicits a

133

strong adaptive immune response, as demonstrated by robust neutralizing antibody

134

production.

135

Infection with Ca-DelMut confers full protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection with

136

sterilizing immunity

137

Because infection with Ca-DelMut causes no apparent disease in hamsters while

138

inducing a strong neutralizing antibody response, we examined the potential of Ca-DelMut as

139

a live attenuated virus vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and disease. Four

140

weeks after infection with Ca-DelMut live attenuated virus, hamsters were re-challenged with

141

wild type SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Two strains of SARS-CoV-2, HK-13 and HK-95, were used

142

in the challenge experiment. HK-95 contains a D614G substitution in the spike protein,

143

which has been suggested to bestow SARS-CoV-2 with higher infectivity in humans

144

Negligible body weight loss was observed in Ca-DelMut vaccinated hamsters infected with

145

either strain of wild type virus, whereas control hamsters not immunized with Ca-DelMut lost

146

about 12-15 percent of body weight by day 5 post-infection (Figure 5A and S5). Analyses of

147

virus replication in the lung and nasal turbinate tissues of re-challenged hamsters showed that

148

Ca-DelMut infection provides sterilizing immunity against subsequent challenge with either

149

HK-13 or HK-95 SARS-CoV-2, with the quantity of virus being either very low or below the

150

level of detection in both lung and nasal tissues on days 2 and 5 post-infection (Figure 5B

151

and S5). Histopathological analysis showed that mock-vaccinated hamster lungs collected at

152

day 5 post-infection with either wild type virus strain showed extensive alveolar exudation

153

and infiltration; bronchiolar epithelial cell death with luminal exudation and cell debris were

154

also observed (Figure 6). In contrast, Ca-DelMut inoculated hamsters challenged with either

155

strain of wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus only experienced mild regional alveolar septal

infiltration and blood vessel congestion at days 2 and 5 post-infection. No other pulmonary

histopathological changes were observed. Our experiment also showed a lower inoculum of

158

Ca-DelMut (1 x 103pfu) is sufficient to provide full protection to the wild type virus

159

Discussion
Coronaviruses are zoonotic pathogens with distinct cross species transmissibility

24

.

166

Besides 229E, OC43, HKU-1 and NL63, which have long been circulating in humans,

167

SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have jumped the species barrier to infect humans

168

in recent years 7. SARS-CoV disappeared in 2004, while MERS-CoV is restricted to a few

169

countries in the Middle East with only sporadic human transmissions since 2012

170

CoV-2 virus utilizes the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV, ACE2, for mediating human

171

infection but has exhibited a distinctive infectivity and transmissibility profile since it was

172

first recognized in humans in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 6. There is strong interest in

173

understanding how SARS-CoV-2 has acquired the unique ability to infect and transmit

174

efficiently in humans. SARS-CoV-2 contains a PRRA polybasic motif not seen in the most

175

closely related bat and pangolin coronaviruses currently known

176

polybasic cleavage site at the S1/S2 junction of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus is

177

considered a critical property for enhanced coronavirus infectivity in humans and zoonotic

178

potential 14,26. A peptide assay has shown that the polybasic cleavage site harbored in SARS-

179

CoV-2 is more accessible to proteases which activate the coronavirus spike protein 10. If the

180

polybasic cleavage site is one of the essential elements providing SARS-CoV-2 with

181

increased infectivity and pathogenicity in humans, removal of this determinant could

182

logically attenuate SARS-CoV-2 into a mild respiratory virus similar to the less pathogenic

183

common coronaviruses currently circulating. Our previous report on a panel of attenuated

184

variants with deletions at the S1/S2 junction supports this contention

185

further characterized one such mutant, Ca-DelMut, showing that it has low pathogenicity and

186

does not provoke an inflammatory response in hamsters and that it induces adaptative

187

immunity protective against subsequent infection with more pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 strains.

188

Ca-DelMut attenuated virus could also be a useful tool for studying SARS-CoV-2 replication,

189

host tissue tropism and transmissibility.

190

Although both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 utilize ACE2 to mediate infection, the

191

distinctive infectivity and pathogenicity displayed by SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be associated

192

with the acquisition of a polybasic furin cleavage site in the protein which, together with

193

enhanced binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD for ACE2, would significantly broaden

194

the tissue tropism of this virus14,27. Deregulated innate immunity during the early stage of

195

infection in the upper respiratory tract may determine the subsequent outcome of

196

dissemination to the lower respiratory tract and disease severity

197

DelMut replicates to comparable levels to wild type virus in the nasal turbinates but less

198

effectively than wild type virus in the lungs (Figure 2C). Importantly, while replication of

199

Ca-DelMut variant was observed in lung tissues, the elevated expression of proinflammatory

200

cytokines elicited in wild type virus infected hamsters was not detected (Figure 3 and S3).

201

These observations clearly suggest that the polybasic cleavage motif is a virulence element in

202

SARS-CoV-2 and that its removal makes SARS-CoV-2 much less pathogenic, and more

203

similar to a common cold respiratory coronavirus. We believe that SARS-CoV-2 will

204

continue to undergo further adaptation as it circulates in humans. Our previous study revealed

205

that variants with deletions at the S1/S2 junction are present at low levels in clinical

206

specimens

207

outbreak human SARS-CoV isolates contained a 29-bp sequence in the ORF8 sequence

208

which was deleted following its subsequent circulation in humans 29. Deletions in ORF7b and

209

ORF8 have also been observed in SARS-CoV-2, although the significance of these

210

alterations is currently unknown

211

CoV-2 in humans will subsequently select for less pathogenic variants similar to Ca-DelMut,

212

or with other mutations.

213

Several SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are being developed for use in humans 32-35. However,

214

no vaccine against a coronavirus has been developed before and there are concerns regarding

215

whether current vaccine strategies will be able to provide adequate and sufficiently long

216

lasting immunity to prevent infection and alleviate disease severity and spread. Anti-SARS-

217

CoV-2 antibodies are reported to decline rapidly in naturally infected individuals

218

study showed that Ca-DelMut induces a different innate immune response to that observed in

219

wild type virus infections in an animal model and evokes sterilizing protective adaptative

220

immunity against challenge with wild type virus (Figure 4). Because Ca-DelMut is attenuated

221

it does not provoke proinflammatory cytokines which could interfere with the induction of

222

adaptive immunity. It is possible that the Ca-DelMut variant may be able to stimulate more

223

balanced and long-lasting immunity; further study is required to comprehensively compare

224

the immune profiles induced by Ca-DelMut and wild type SARS-CoV-2 viruses. The

225

potential applications of this attenuated SARS-CoV-2 virus should be explored and evaluated.

226

However, given the high replication efficiency and low pathogenicity of Ca-DelMut, it may

227

be an ideal strain for production of an inactivated vaccine, in addition to holding promise as a

228

live attenuated vaccine.

Online Methods

231

Generation of cell adapted Del-mut (Ca-DelMut) virus

232

Del-mut viruses were prepared as previously described 15. To generate Ca-DelMut virus, the

233

Del-Mut-1 virus was serially passaged 10 times in Vero E6 cells at 33oC and then passaged at

234

30oC 8 times. For each passage, incubation time was 2-3 days, depending on the occurrence

235

of cytopathic effects. After the 18th passage, the virus was amplified in a T75 Flask, then

236

titered by plaque assay and sequenced using the Sanger method.

237

Growth kinetics

238

Confluent Vero E6 or Calu-3 cells were infected at 0.01 moi with the indicated viruses and

239

incubated for 3 days. Virus supernatant was collected at the indicated time points. Virus titers

240

were determined by plaque assay using Vero E6 cells.

241

Plaque assay

242

Confluent Vero E6 cells in 6-well format were incubated with 10-fold serially diluted virus

243

for 1 h. After adsorption, virus was discarded. Cells were washed and overlaid with 1%

244

agarose in DMEM and incubated for 3 days at 37oC. Cells were fixed with 10%

245

formaldehyde for 1 day. Agarose gels were then removed and plaques stained with 1%

246

crystal violet and counted.

247

Immunization and challenge of hamsters

248

7-8 week old golden Syrian hamsters were anesthetized intraperitoneally with ketamine and

249

xylazine and then immunized intranasally with 1.25x105 pfu of Ca-DelMut or SZ-002 virus

250

or mock immunized with PBS. Body weight and disease symptoms were monitored daily. At

251

day 21, sera were collected from hamsters for anti-spike RBD IgG and neutralizing antibody

252

determination. At day 28, Ca-DelMut- and mock-immunized hamsters were challenged with

253

WT virus (HK-13 or HK-95) at a dose of 1x103 pfu. Body weight and disease symptoms

254

were monitored daily and at days 2 and 5, lung and nasal turbinate tissues were collected for
12

255

histopathology and virus titration by plaque assay. For low dose immunization, hamsters

256

were immunized with 103 pfu of either Ca-DelMut or WT HK-13 virus, or mock immunized

257

with PBS. All experiments involving SARS-CoV-2 were conducted in a biosafety level 3

258

laboratory. All animal studies were approved by the Committee on the Use of Live Animals

259

in Teaching and Research, The University of Hong Kong.

260

Pathogenicity of Ca-DelMut and wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus in hamsters

261

Hamsters were challenged intranasally with 1x103 or 1.25x105 pfu of Ca-DelMut or 1x103

262

pfu of WT virus. Body weight and disease symptoms were monitored daily. At days 2 and 4,

263

lung and nasal turbinate tissues were collected for histopathological study, determination of

264

proinflammatory cytokine expression and virus titration.

265

Neutralization assay

266

Heat inactivated sera from Ca-DelMut challenged hamsters were 2-fold serially diluted in

267

DMEM medium and incubated with 100 pfu of the indicated virus at 37oC for 1 h. The mix

268

was added to confluent Vero E6 cells and incubated for 4 days at 37oC. NaÃ¯ve and WT

269

challenged sera were used as controls. After 4 days, cytopathic effect (CPE) was detected by

270

microscopy, with the neutralization endpoint being the highest serum dilution causing 50%

271

inhibition of CPE.

272

ELISA

273

A hamster anti-spike RBD IgG detection kit (Wantai-Bio) was used to detect RBD specific

274

antibodies. Procedures were conducted in accordance with the manual. Briefly, heat

275

inactivated sera from Ca-DelMut challenged hamsters were 10-fold serially diluted and added

276

to the plate and incubated at 37oC for 30 mins. Sera from mock- and WT-challenged hamsters

277

were included as controls. The plate was washed 5 times and then incubated with secondary

278

and the plate incubated at 37oC for 15 mins. Stop solution was added and absorbance at 450

280

nm measured.

281

Quantification of expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines

282

Expression of proinflammatory cytokines was quantified using a qRT-PCR technique similar

283

to that described in a previous study 38. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from hamster lungs

284

using RNAzol RT reagent (MRC) according to the manual. cDNA was synthesized using a

285

High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Invitrogen) and oligo dT primers following

286

the protocol provided. qPCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara) reagent

287

and gene specific primers in an LC480 PCR machine (Roche). PCR conditions were as

288

follows: initial denaturation: 95oC for 5 min, 45 cycles of amplification: 95oC for 10s, 60oC

289

for 10s, 72oC for 10s, and melting curve analysis: 65oC to 97oC at 0.1oC/s. Expression of

290

target genes was normalized to the internal reference gene (hamster Î³-actin) and the

291

comparative Ct (2-ÎÎCt) method utilized to calculate the cytokine expression profile.

292

Histopathology

293

Organs were fixed in 10% PBS buffered formalin and processed into paraffin-embedded

294

blocks. Tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined by

295

light microscopy as in a previous study38.

Figure S2. Infection with Ca-DelMut causes only mild pathological changes. Hamsters were
infected with 1x103 pfu of either Ca-DelMut or HK-13 (WT), or mock infected. At days 2 and
4 post-infection, lungs and small intestine were collected and fixed in 10% formalin, and then
processed into paraffin blocks and sections H&E stained.
(a) The top panel shows normal lung structures in the lungs of mock-infected control hamsters
at 4x (left) and 20x (right) magnification. At day 2 after infection with Ca-DelMut, lung tissues
showed only mild regional alveolar septal infiltration and blood vessel congestion. No obvious
bronchiolar epithelium desquamation or luminal debris (arrows), and no alveolar space
infiltration or exudation were observed. At day 4, no deleterious progression of histopathology
was observed.
For WT virus at day 2 post-infection, the low magnification image (left) showed regional lung
consolidation and focal pulmonary hemorrhage (arrows). The higher magnification image

(right) showed massive alveolar space infiltration (arrowheads) and hemorrhage, with a little
bronchiolar luminal cell debris (arrows) visible. At day 4 post WT-infection, the low
magnification image (left) showed intensive alveolar exudation, infiltration and hemorrhage
resulting in pulmonary consolidation (arrows), while the higher magnification image (right)
showed intensive protein rich exudates filling the alveolar space (arrows), in addition to
massive infiltration and alveolar hemorrhage; a blood vessel shows moderate infiltration
(arrowheads).
(b) Representative histological images of hamster small intestines. The left-most image shows
mock-infected control hamster small intestinal villi with normal structure. At day 4 post infection
with Ca-DelMut, no apparent histopathological changes were detected in the small intestine
(middle). For WT virus infection, small intestinal lamina propria blood vessel congestion,
infiltration and edema resulting in swelling of the villi (solid arrows) and enterocyte desquamation
(open arrows) were observed.

Figure S3

Figure S3. Ca-DelMut does not induce elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in
hamsters. Hamsters were infected intranasally with 1x103 pfu of either Ca-DelMut or WT HK13 virus. At days 2 and 4, RNA was extracted from lung and nasal turbinate tissues using
RNAsol RT procedures. cDNA was synthesized using oligo dT primers. Expression of
different proinflammatory cytokines was examined by qPCR, normalized to the internal
reference gene (hamster Î³-actin), and the comparative Ct (2-ÎÎCt) method was utilized to
calculate the cytokine expression profile. Statistical comparisons between means were
performed by Studentâs t-test: *** p<0.001, ** p<0.01, * p<0.05, ns: not significant.

Figure S4. Lower dose (103 pfu) Ca-DelMut immunization is able to induce a strong humoral
response in hamsters. Hamsters were infected intranasally with 1x103 pfu of either Ca-DelMut
or HK-13 virus, or mock immunized. At day 21, blood was collected from hamsters and tested
for anti-S1 RBD IgG titers (a) and neutralization activity against HK-13 virus (b). Error bars
represent mean Â± s.d. (n=3). LOD: level of detection.

Figure S5. Lower dose Ca-DelMut immunization still provides complete protection against
WT HK-13 virus. Hamsters were infected intranasally with 1x103 pfu of either Ca-DelMut or
HK-13 virus, or mock immunized. At day 28 after immunization, hamsters were challenged
with 1x103 pfu of HK-13 virus. Body weight change and disease symptoms were monitored
for 5 days. At day 5 post-infection, lungs and nasal turbinate tissues were collected for virus
titration. Error bars represent mean Â± s.d. (n=3).

Figure S6. Low inoculum of Ca-DelMut provides protection againstreinfection of wild type
SARS-CoV-2. Hamsters were infected intranasally with 1x103 pfu of either Ca-DelMut, HK13 strain or mock immunized. At day 28 after immunization, hamsters were challenged with
1x103 pfu of HK-13 virus. At day 5 post infection, lungs were collected for histopathological
study. Lungs were fixed in 10% formalin, and then processed in paraffin blocks and H&E
staining. Mock vaccinated hamster lung showed bronchiolar epithelial cells death and luminal
secretion mixed with cell debris (arrows); diffuse alveolar infiltration and exudation
(arrowheads); Ca-DelMut immunized lung showed no apparent bronchiolar epithelium cell
death (arrows), alveoli showed regional septal infiltrationIn HK-13 strain immunized hamster
lung showed no apparent histopathology other than alveolar wall thickening (arrowheads) after
re-challenge.
