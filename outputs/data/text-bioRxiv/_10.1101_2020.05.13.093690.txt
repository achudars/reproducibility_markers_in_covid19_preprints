Abstract
New coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is capable to infect humans and cause a novel disease
COVID-19. Aiming to understand a host genetic component of COVID-19, we focused on variants
in genes encoding proteases and genes involved in innate immunity that could be important for
susceptibility and resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Analysis of sequence data of coding regions of FURIN, PLG, PRSS1, TMPRSS11a, MBL2 and
OAS1 genes in 143 unrelated individuals from Serbian population identified 22 variants with
potential functional effect. In silico analyses (PolyPhen-2, SIFT, MutPred2 and Swiss-Pdb
Viewer) predicted that 10 variants could impact the structure and/or function of proteins. These
protein-altering variants (p.Gly146Ser in FURIN; p.Arg261His and p.Ala494Val in PLG;
p.Asn54Lys in PRSS1; p.Arg52Cys, p.Gly54Asp and p.Gly57Glu in MBL2; p.Arg47Gln,
p.Ile99Val and p.Arg130His in OAS1) may have predictive value for inter-individual differences
in the response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Next, we performed comparative population analysis for the same variants using extracted data
from the 1000 genomes project. Population genetic variability was assessed using delta MAF and
Fst statistics. Our study pointed to 7 variants in PLG, TMPRSS11a, MBL2 and OAS1 genes with
noticeable divergence in allelic frequencies between populations worldwide. Three of them, all in
MBL2 gene, were predicted to be damaging, making them the most promising population-specific
markers related to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Comparing allelic frequencies between Serbian and other populations, we found that the highest
level of genetic divergence related to selected loci was observed with African, followed by East

Asian, Central and South American and South Asian populations. When compared with European
populations, the highest divergence was observed with Italian population.
In conclusion, we identified 4 variants in genes encoding proteases (FURIN, PLG and PRSS1) and
6 in genes involved in the innate immunity (MBL2 and OAS1) that might be relevant for the host
response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Introduction

A new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 capable to infect humans, emerged in mid-December
2019 in Wuhan, China, causing the novel disease COVID-19 [1]. Clinical manifestations of this
viral infection vary from asymptomatic to severe acute respiratory syndrome and death. The
number of infected people and affected countries have quickly risen and already in March 2020,
World Health Organization declared a pandemic [2]. Therefore, it became highly important to
understand if specific human genes and genetic variants could be associated with susceptibility or
resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection and how frequencies of these variants vary between different
populations. Human genes usually associated with susceptibility and resistance to viral infection
are those associated with the point of viral entry into the human host cells, such as genes encoding
receptors, co-receptors and enzymes that modify receptors [3]. Furthermore, various genes
involved in the immune response, such as virus sensing, signaling in response to virus, antiviral
factors etc. have also been found to be important for the severity and the outcome of viral
infections. A recent study which analyzed COVID-19 symptoms in monozygotic and dizygotic
twins, reported that 50 (95% confidence intervals 29-70)% of the variance of ‘predicted COVID19’ phenotype is due to genetic factors [4].
Deciphering the RNA sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome showed that this new virus belongs
to lineage B betacoronaviruses, together with the SARS-CoV virus which emerged in 2002 [1].
Genetic susceptibility and resistance to SARS-CoV had been extensively studied by genotyping
SARS patients with extremely severe and extremely mild clinical manifestations. As a result,
variants in OAS1, MX1, MBL2, CCL2, CCL5, ASHG, IFNgamma, CD14 and CD209 genes were

associated with genetic susceptibility to SARS-CoV [5-11]. Majority of variants that emerged in
such studies were located in non-coding parts of the human genome and their effect is observable
in the fine tuning of the gene expression. Also, variants residing in coding regions, such as
rs1800450 in MBL2 gene [6] were particularly interesting as they alter protein structure and
function.
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share ~76% amino acid sequence identity of the spike (S) protein
sequence, a crucial part of the viral envelope which enables specific binding to the receptors at
human cells, therefore contributing to viral potential to infect humans [12, 13]. It was shown that
SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, as SARSCoV does, however with the higher affinity [14]. Human transmembrane protease serine 2
(TMPRSS2), an enzyme important for the entry of SARS-CoV [15], was recently found to activate
the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 [16].
Moreover, it was found that the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 contains a furin-like cleavage site
which is absent in coronaviruses of the same clade [17]. Knowing that furin cleavage sites are
responsible for the high virulence of human influenza viruses [18], it was suggested that furin-like
site in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 represents its advantage in attaching to the human cells
expressing ACE2 receptor.
The SARS-CoV-2 relies on the host cell proteases to cut its S protein in two parts thus forming Nterminal part which recognizes ACE2 receptor and C-terminal part involved in the viral entry
which must be further cleaved by furin and/or other furin-like enzymes [17]. It has been shown
that plasmin is also capable to cleave furin sites [19] and that individuals with elevated plasmin
demonstrated higher susceptibility to COVID-19 [20]. In addition to plasmin, S protein of
coronaviruses may be cleaved by other airway proteases such as trypsin-1 and TMPRSS11a [20].

At the beginning of May 2020, in the full swing of COVID-19 pandemic, the data on genetic
susceptibility or resistance to SARS-CoV-2 which would be based on the genotyping of
individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 are still lacking. However, a detailed study using
computational prediction methods for protein structure analyses revealed that 17 variants in the
coding regions of the ACE2 gene are located at positions important for the binding of ACE2 with
the SARS-CoV-2 S protein [21]. Based on these predictions, individuals carrying these variants
would probably be resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Yet, all these variants were rare (less than
0.00388 allele frequency) and interestingly enough their association with any human disease or
disorder has never been reported [21]. Having in mind the rarity of variants that could directly
influence the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, it is not surprising that comparative genetic
analysis of the frequency of ACE2 variants in different populations did not predict the existence
of individuals resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection [22].
ACE2 is not the only possible player that could influence the interaction between humans and
SARS-CoV-2 virus. The furin could be the second important factor to contribute to high
pathogenicity of the novel virus. Furthermore, we can learn from clinical experiences of the SARSCoV-2 infection which showed that plasmin and other airway proteases could also be important
for patients experiencing more severe form of COVID-19 [20]. In addition, the knowledge based
on SARS epidemic shows that MBL2 and OAS1 genes, involved in the innate immune response,
could also modulate susceptibility to infection with betacoronaviruses.
Taking all these players into account, we performed genetic analysis of variants in coding regions
of FURIN, plasminogen (PLG), trypsin-1 (PRSS1), TMPRSS11a, MBL2 and OAS1 genes in
Serbian populations aiming to identify possible genetic markers that are capable to impact protein
structure/function and thus contribute to the susceptibility or resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We postulate that the variants in genes encoding proteases could be advantageous, while variants
in genes encoding proteins involved in the innate immunity add some disadvantage to individuals
in combating COVID-19. We also performed comparative genetic analysis in different populations
in order to assess the divergence between populations for those variants.

Subjects and methods

Genetic and bioinformatic analysis
In this study, we analyzed the genomic sequence data of unrelated individuals from Serbian
population, extracted from the in-house database of Laboratory for Molecular Biomedicine,
Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade. Written
informed consent was obtained from all participants. The study was conducted in accordance with
the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the Ethic Committee of Institute of Molecular Genetics
and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade.
Total of 143 unrelated Serbian individuals (84 males and 59 females) were previously analyzed by
NGS approach using the Illumina Clinical Exome Sequencing TruSight One Gene Panel (Illumina,
San Diego, CA, USA), as previously described [23]. VCF files were further annotated and
examined using the Illumina VariantStudio 3.0 Data Analysis Software (Illumina, San Diego, CA,
USA). Variants that did not pass variant call quality filters (those with quality score <Q20, read
depth <20, percentage of variant frequency for the minor allele <20% and homopolymer length
>8) in more than 10% of samples were excluded. Variants that were considered for further analysis

were either missense, start loss, stop gain, splice region variants and frameshift, while synonymous
variants were omitted. For all selected variants, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested, using the
chi square goodness of fit test.
Next, we compared genotype data from Serbian population with European (Italy, Spain, Finland,
Great Britain and USA with European ancestry), as well as other 4 super-populations, Eastern
Asians, South Asians, African and Ad Mixed American - Central and South American populations
(total of 2504 subjects). Genotype data were extracted from the VCF files of Phase 3 variant calls
of the 1000 Genomes Project (1kGP) sample collection (https://www.internationalgenome.org/)
via Ensembl Data Slicer Tool. Populations and details regarding the 1kGP data were described
previously [24]. Fisher exact test was used to measure significant differences in genotypes
distributions between Serbian and 1kGP populations, applying Bonferoni correction for multiple
testing.
We examined the level of population genetic variability at each selected loci using: (1) the maximal
global differences in minor allele frequencies (delta MAF) calculated by subtracting the maximum
and the minimum MAF across analyzed population groups, (2) using Fst statistics [25], which is
widely used in population genetics [26].
R software was utilized for genotype data manipulation, statistical calculations as well as graphical
presentations. For estimating Fst statistics, R packages adegenet and hierfstat were used.

In silico prediction analysis
Protein sequences were downloaded from Ensemble, accessed on 2020/04/24 at
http://www.ensembl.org. To predict the effect of nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions, we
used in silico prediction algorithms: PolyPhen-2 (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph2),
SIFT/PROVEAN (http://provean.jcvi.org/index.php) and MutPred2 (http://mutpred.mutdb.org/).
The Swiss-Pdb Viewer (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, at http://www.expasy.org/spdbv) was
used to analyze the effects of variants upon the structure of the proteins, using the crystal structures
with PDB codes 4ig8.pdb for the structure of human OAS1 in complex with dsRNA and 2'-deoxy
ATP, and 4z2a.pdb for the structure of unglycosylated apo human furin (Protein Data Bank-RCSB,
accessed on the 2020/04/24, at http://www.rcsb.org/pdb).

Results

Analysis of genetic variants found in Serbian population
Analysis of sequence data of coding regions of FURIN, PLG, PRSS1, TMPRSS11a, MBL2
and OAS1 genes in 143 unrelated individuals from Serbian population identified 22 variants with
potential functional effects (Table 1). Among identified variants, there were 19 missense variants,
1 start lost, 1 missense/splice region and 1 splice region variant. Majority of the detected variants
were rare (8 variants had minor allele frequency of 0.3%, while 4 variants of 0.7%). We detected
the highest minor allelic frequency for the OAS1 p.Gly162Ser, being 41%. All detected variants
were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

Total of 143 subject from Serbian population were genotyped for selected genes by next generation sequencing approach. Genotype is
presented as ref/ref for the homozygous reference allele, ref/alt for heterozygous and alt/alt for homozygous variant allele. For two
variants in PRSS1 gene, variant call quality filters did not pass in all samples, therefore genotyping of variant rs148440491 involved
135, while rs200381474 involved 141 subjects (marked with *). PolyPhen-2, SIFT and MutPred2 prediction of coding nonsynonymous
variants are presented with scores, with SIFT score ranging from 1 for benign to 0 for deleterious variants, whereas scores for PolyPhen2 and MutPred2 range from 0 for benign to 1 for damaging variants (using cutoff value 0.5 for MutPred). Where possible, Swiss-Pdb
Model was used for in silico prediction, which was indicated in the table for individual variants. SNV ID - single nucleotide variant
identifier, HW p - Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium statistics.

In silico prediction analysis
Next, we performed in silico prediction analysis of the identified variants’ effect, using
PolyPhen-2, SIFT and MutPred2 algorithms (Table 1). Nine missense variants were predicted to
be deleterious/damaging by both PolyPhen-2 and SIFT (p.Gly146Ser in FURIN; p.Arg261His and
p.Ala494Val in PLG; p.Asn54Lys in PRSS1; p.Arg52Cys, p.Gly54Asp and p.Gly57Glu in MBL2;
p.Ile99Val and p.Arg130His in OAS1), while MutPred2 provided additional indication of
pathogenicity for 4 of them (p.Gly146Ser in FURIN, p.Asn54Lys in PRSS1, p.Gly54Asp and
p.Gly57Glu in MBL2). Although variant p.Arg47Gln in OAS1 is predicted to be benign/tolerated
by PolyPhen-2, SIFT and MutPred2 algorithms, the analysis in Swiss-Pdb Viewer showed that the
side chain of Arg47, unlike the glutamine at this position, was predicted to be important for dsRNA
binding.
Among those 10 genetic variants predicted to impact the structure and/or function of proteins, 8
were found to be rare (p.Gly146Ser in FURIN; p.Arg261His and p.Ala494Val in PLG; p.Asn54Lys
in PRSS1; p.Gly57Glu in MBL2; p.Arg47Gln, p.Ile99Val and p.Arg130His in OAS1). These
variants may have predictive value for inter-individual differences in the response to the SARSCoV-2 infection.
Other 2 variants with potentially damaging effect, p.Arg52Cys and p.Gly54Glu in MBL2 gene,
having allelic frequency of 8% and 14%, respectively, are the most promising population-specific
markers to be considered for association study in COVID-19 patients in Serbia.
In total, 4 variants in genes encoding proteases (FURIN, PLG and PRSS1) and 6 in genes involved
in the innate immunity (MBL2 and OAS1) might be interesting for further studies in relation to the
response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Comparative population analysis
Our next goal was to investigate the allele frequency in populations worldwide for the same
22 genetic variants detected in Serbian population. The minor allele frequencies (MAF) were
extracted from the 1kG project involving European populations (Italy, Spain, Finland, Great
Britain and USA with European ancestry) as well as Eastern Asians, South Asians, African and
Ad Mixed American (Central and South American populations) (Table 2). We denoted MAF as
the frequency of the minor allele found in European populations. Majority of variants were with
low frequency among all populations (MAF≤ 0.05). From all detected variants, 17 were shared
between at least two populations, while 5 were found only in Serbian population.

MAF has been denoted as the frequency of the minor allele found in the European populations.
Delta MAF (dMAF) was calculated by substracting the maximum and the minimum MAF across
analyzed population groups. Fst values represent measures of genetic divergence among selected
populations at each analyzed locus. Fst value ranges between 0 and 1. The smaller Fst is, allele
frequencies among populations are more similar, while large Fst means that allele frequencies are
more divergent. Populations: SRB - Serbian, TSI - Tuscany in Italy, IBS - Iberian populations in
Spain, FIN - Finnish in Finland, GBR - British in England and Scotland, CEU - Utah residents
with Northern and Western European ancestry, EAS - East Asian, SAS - South Asian, AFR African, AMR - Central and South American populations.

The level of population genetic variability at each selected loci was assessed using two approaches,
delta MAF and Fst statistics. Significant correlation between obtained delta MAF and Fst values
(r=0.74, p=0.000033) was observed. MAF distributions of seven genetic variants (p.Asp472Asn

Promisingly, three of those variants (p.Arg52Cys, p.Gly54Asp and p.Gly57Glu in MBL2), that
showed considerable divergence in frequencies among all analyzed populations, were also
predicted to have damaging effect on the protein. Variants p.Gly54Asp and p.Gly57Glu showed
extreme MAF values in African compared to other populations (p.Gly54Asp MAF range: 1.4% in
African to the 21.9% in Central and South American; p.Gly57Glu MAF range: 0% in Italian and
East Asians to the 25.9% in African). MBL2 p.Arg52Cys variant showed variable distribution
among analyzed populations, having the highest MAF in Finish (11%), followed by Serbian
population (8%), while the lowest MAF was in East Asian and African populations (0%).
Having in mind that variants in proteins involved in the innate immunity could be unfavorable in
COVID-19 patients, further studies on variant MBL2 p.Gly54Asp in Central and South American
and on variant MBL2 p.Gly57Glu in African populations are indicated.
Furthermore, for these seven most divergent variants, we calculated Fisher exact test statistics of
Serbian against 1kGP populations based on their genotypic frequencies (Table 3). After Bonferoni
correction, significant differences were observed in distribution of PLG p.Asp472Asn and MBL2
p.Arg52Cys compared to Asian populations. In comparison with African populations, all variants,
except TMPRSS11a p.Met1Ile, had significantly distinct distributions. Significant differences were
observed as well compared to Central and South American populations in distribution of PLG
p.Asp472Asn, TMPRSS11a p.Gln293Arg and p.Met1Ile variants.

Serbian and 1kGP populations. Test was two tailed and p value was considered significant at
0.0007 after Bonferoni correction for multiple testing. Significant differences are indicated in bold.

Finally, we analyzed genetic variation related to selected loci between Serbian and 1kGP
populations using pairwise Fst calculation [25] (Table 4). Fst value ranges between 0 and 1. The
smaller Fst indicates similar allele frequencies among populations, and vice versa, large Fst means
that allele frequencies are more divergent. Comparing Serbian to other populations, the highest
level of genetic differentiation related to selected loci was observed with African (Fst=0.147),
followed by East Asian (Fst=0.054), Central and South American populations (0.036) and South
Asian population (0.026). When compared with European populations, the highest divergence was
observed with Italian population (Fst=0.012).

Discussion

While mutations in the RNA of betacoronavirus opened the possibility to jump to a new
specie, variants in various human genes may contribute to increased susceptibility to a new
pathogen, or could have a protective role. One of the most illustrious examples are variants in CD4
receptor which contribute to susceptibility to some strains of HIV infection, while variants in
CCR5 gene provide resistance to its carriers [27, 28].

Recent studies addressed rare variants in ACE2 gene which could directly influence the binding to
S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 and the population-specific differences of more frequent ACE2 gene
variants [21, 22]. However, having in mind complexity of the interaction between the virus and
the host, which besides the S protein – ACE2 receptor interaction, includes the role of different
host proteases and at least some elements of innate immunity with antiviral activity, in this study
we selected additional genes that could be important for the susceptibility or resistance to the
SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. We focused on genetic variants in genes FURIN, PLG, PRSS1,
TMPRSS11a, that encode proteases, as well as variants in genes MBL2 and OAS1, that encode
proteins involved in innate immunity, attempting to find promising candidate alleles that might be
included in the future genetic test related to new waives of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemics.
To systematically examine the coding variants in selected genes and differences in the allele
frequency between populations, we performed comparative analysis of 22 variants found in
FURIN, PLG, PRSS1, TMPRSS11a, MBL2 and OAS1 genes from Serbian population database with
different European populations and super-populations extracted from 1kGP database [24]. Also,
we used bioinformatic tools to predict the effect of these genetic variants on the structure and/or
function of proteins encoded by FURIN, PLG, PRSS1, TMPRSS11a, MBL2 and OAS1 genes.
It could be possible that the existence of variants in genes encoding proteases provide advantage
while variants in genes for proteins involved in the innate immunity add some disadvantage to
individuals in combating COVID-19.

Variants in genes for host proteases
Host proteases, such as furin, plasmin, trypsin-1 and TMPRSS11a, are crucial in the
process of cutting the S protein of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 envelope at the S1/S2
cleavage site, which is a necessary event needed to release the S1 fragment (N-terminal part) and
the S2 fragment (C-terminal part) [17]. The S1 fragment recognizes ACE2 receptor at the surface
of the human cells, and the S2 fragment is involved in the viral entry into the cells [29].
Furthermore, the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 must be cleaved at both, S1/S2 cleavage site
and at the furin-like cleavage site inside the S2 fragment in order to enable viral entry [17]. It was
previously shown that the cleavage by host proteases plasmin, trypsin-1 and TMPRSS11a at both
sites of the S protein is mandatory for the entry of SARS-CoV into human bronchial epithelial
cells in vitro [30]. Interestingly, the furin like S2’ cleavage site is identical between SARS-CoV
and SARS-CoV-2 [17] thus implying the capability of furin, plasmin, trypsin-1 and TMPRSS11a
to perform activation steps and enable viral entry into the human cells. The efficiency of all these
four proteases contribute to regulation of cellular tropism and determination of viral pathogenesis.
Thus, genetic variants that would impact the structure and/or function of furin, plasmin, trypsin-1
and TMPRSS11 may lead to inter-individual differences in the response to the SARS-CoV-2
infection.
FURIN encodes a type 1 membrane bound protease, one of the seven basic amino acid-specific
members which cleave their substrates at single or paired basic residues. First, furin is
autocatalyticaly processed in the endoplasmatic reticulum and then transported to the trans-Golgi
network where a second autocatalytic event takes place and the catalytic activity is acquired. In
addition to having affinity for various substrates in human tissues, it is probably one of the
proteases responsible for the activation of SARS-CoV-2 envelope S glycoproteins [17]. Two rare

variants, p.Thr33Ala and p.Gly146Ser, were detected in FURIN. Thr33 residue is located in the
pro-domain of a peptidase and therefore cleaved off in the process of activation of the furin
enzyme, whereas Gly146 residue is located within the peptidase domain of the enzyme [31]. A
substitution of Gly146 to Ser is predicted to be probably damaging/deleterious by PolyPhen-2 and
SIFT algorithms, while MutPred2 software has several hypotheses, including altered metal binding
and altered catalytic site. Also, when we analyzed the effect of this variant upon the structure of
furin protein in Swiss-Pdb Viewer, a change to Ser at position 146 is predicted to cause steric
clashes with His145, which may lead to an unstable protein. Taken altogether, p.Gly146Ser variant
may amend the activity of furin in its proprotein convertase function, and may change its ability
to cleave furin-like sites in the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2.
Plasminogen is a protease which belongs to peptidase family S1 and it is encoded by the PLG
gene. Proteolysis of plasminogen results in multiple forms of the active plasmin. Plasminogen is
present in the human lung tissues, more precisely in the airway, alveolar type I and II epithelial
cells as well as in endothelial cells [20]. Six very rare variants were identified in the PLG gene:
p.Glu55Gln, p.Arg89Lys, p.Arg261His, p.Gly420Asp, detected only on one chromosome (MAF
0.003), and p.Ala494Val, p.Arg523Trp on two chromosomes (MAF 0.007). Variants p.Arg261His
and p.Ala494Val are predicted to be probably damaging/deleterious, while p.Glu55Gln,
p.Arg89Lys, p.Gly420Asp, and p.Arg523Trp are mostly predicted to be benign/tolerated by
PolyPhen-2, SIFT and MutPred2 algorithms. Residues Glu55 and Arg89 are located in the PanApple domain, while Arg261, Gly420A, Ala494 and Arg523 reside in different Kringle domains
of the proenzyme precursor plasminogen [32]. Given that the Pan-Apple domains mediate proteinprotein or protein-carbohydrate interactions, whereas Kringle domains play a role in binding
mediators, these variants may be involved in fine tuning of plasmin activity. Having in mind that

individuals with elevated plasmin had greater susceptibility to COVID-19 and more severe clinical
manifestations [20], rare variants in PLG, such as p.Arg261His and p.Ala494Val may be
recognized as potential markers of inter-individual differences in susceptibility to coronavirus.
Trypsin-1 is encoded by the PRSS1 gene which is a member of the trypsin-1 family of serine
proteases. It is active on peptide linkages involving the carboxyl group of lysine or arginine. This
enzyme is secreted by the pancreas and cleaved to its active form in the small intestine. It is also
present in airway and alveolar type I and II epithelial cells [20]. Two rare variants in the PRSS1
gene, c.592-8C>T and p.Asn54Lys, were detected. Variant c.592-8C>T was previously detected
in patients with cystic fibrosis presenting with chronic pancreatitis [33]. Given that this is a splice
region variant, it may affect splicing and therefore the level of trypsin-1 protein. Trypsin-1 variant
p.Asn54Lys leads to the substitution of polar asparagine residue to a positively charged lysine.
This variant is predicted to be possibly damaging/deleterious by PolyPhen-2 and SIFT algorithms,
while MutPred2 software suggested that this change may alter the catalytic site. Given that the
catalytic triad of trypsin-1 enzyme is consisted of His57, Asn102 and Ser195 [34], the proximity
of Asn54 to His57 might modify the enzymatic activity. The same codon is affected by an
alternative variant, p.Asn54Ser, which was classified pathogenic by UniProt, and associated with
chronic pancreatitis [35, 36]. Nevertheless, having in mind that the variant p.Asn54Lys was
observed in healthy adults, this variant is not regarded as a disease causing in the context of
Mendelian diseases. Its mechanism might be through the fine modification of trypsin-1 enzymatic
activity, which could contribute to the resistance of some individuals to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Transmembrane serine protease 11A, encoded by the TMPRSS11a gene is one of the members of
type II transmembrane serine proteases and it is present in upper respiratory tract (pharynx and
trachea) and digestive tract [30]. Two rare variants were detected in the TMPRSS11A gene:

p.Lys48Arg and p.Arg328Gln. For both of these variants, PolyPhen-2, SIFT and MutPred2
algorithms predict benign/tolerated effect. Given the scarce data on the protein structure of
TMPRSS11A, the effect of this variants is yet to be ascertained.

Variants in genes for proteins involved in the host innate immunity
Innate immunity is important in defending organism from viral infections. After SARSCoV outbreak it was found that type I interferons could inhibit the replication of this virus and that
these interferons further induce different proteins with antiviral activity [37]. One of such proteins
is encoded by the OAS1 gene. OAS1 synthesizes 2',5'-oligoadenylates, and as a consequence
activates latent RNase L which cuts single-stranded RNAs thus leading to the viral RNA
degradation and inhibition of viral replication [38]. Three rare variants were detected in the OAS1
gene: p.Arg47Gln, p.Ile99Val and p.Arg130His. Interestingly, human OAS1 protein recognizes
two adjacent minor grooves of dsRNA with C-terminal lobe and N-terminal lobe, where the Arg47
residue is one of the residues involved in the recognition [39]. When analyzed in Swiss-Pdb
Viewer, the side chain of Arg47 residue was predicted to form hydrogen bond with dsRNA, while
a change to glutamine at this position was predicted to abolish this hydrogen bond. Furthermore,
Gln at this position is predicted to form hydrogen bonds with Cys45 and Phe46, and also to cause
steric clashes with Glu43 and Arg44. Nevertheless, variant p.Arg47Gln is predicted to be
benign/tolerated by PolyPhen-2, SIFT and MutPred2 algorithms, so its effect on the OAS1 protein
seems not to affect the structure itself, but it may be apparent upon the binding of the dsRNA.
Variant p.Ile99Val is predicted to be possibly damaging/deleterious by prediction algorithms, but
the analysis in Swiss-Pdb Viewer revealed that the backbone of the Ile99 residue is predicted to

form hydrogen bonds with Arg95, Gly96 and Arg103, so the change to Val at this position did not
change the existing bonds, nor did it form novel ones. Variant p.Arg130His is predicted to be
probably damaging/deleterious by prediction algorithms, and the analysis in Swiss-Pdb Viewer
showed that in case of Arg130, a change to His at this position was predicted to result in the
formation of novel hydrogen bonds with Thr188 and also a steric clash with Glu185. These rare
variants may have an effect on the OAS1 structure and/or function through the formation of novel
hydrogen bonds and steric clashes, leading to a less stable protein. In case of variants located at
the protein/RNA interface formed upon the binding, its effects reflect on the formation of (to some
extent) weaker bond with the RNA thus lowering its 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity, as it
was shown that variants at the protein/RNA interface impair OAS1 activity by 60- to 2,500-fold
[39]. Furthermore, having in mind that the active form of human OAS1 is tetrameric, any variant
potentially impairing the oligomerization process would also have an effect on the activity of the
enzyme, the synthesis of 2',5'-oligoadenylates, and consequently the activation of the latent RNase
and the degradation of viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2. Knowing that variants in OAS1, such as
p.Gly397Arg were previously associated with susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection in some
populations [5], the effects of p.Arg47Gln, p.Ile99Val and p.Arg130His might be interesting for
further investigation.

Comparative population analysis
The comparative population analysis pointed to the 7 coding variants in PLG, TMPRSS11a,
MBL2 and OAS1 with noticeable divergence in allelic frequencies between analyzed populations.

Three variants were found in genes encoding proteases. Variant p.Asp472Asn in PLG gene showed
notable MAF discrepancy between European and Asian populations, being the highest in Spain
(0.34) and the lowest in East Asians (0.0). This substitution of neutral to acidic amino acid arises
in a loop region that connects two Kringle domains of plasminogen and it was presumed to have a
functional effect through altering the alignment of Kringle domains [40]. This variant was shown
previously to influence susceptibility to invasive aspergillosis [40]. Having in mind the MAF
difference between Spanish and East Asian populations, it would be interesting to further
investigate whether it also reflects the remarkable differences in susceptibility and morbidity to
COVID-19 between these populations. Two variants in TMPRSS11A showed interesting data for
Serbian population, with both variants showing lower MAF in Serbian population (0.16 for
p.Met1Ile and 0.26 for p.Gln293Arg) compared to other European populations - average MAF
0.22 for p.Met1Ile and 0.37 for p.Gln293Arg. As a start loss variant, p.Met1Ile leads to start of the
translation from the neighboring Met2 residue. Start loss variants can range from disease causing
to benign start codon variants, so with the high frequency of p.Met1Ile in all analyzed populations,
its effect is presumed to be benign. While variant p.Gln293Arg was described as a cumulative risk
factor for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [41], its effect on the protease activity and COVID19 susceptibility remains to be elucidated.
Four variants were found in genes involved in the innate immunity. Variant p.Gly162Ser in OAS1
was shown to have highest MAF in African populations - 0.85, more than double the average MAF
of European populations (0.42). This variant was previously weakly associated with type I diabetes
[42] and multiple sclerosis [43], but a more recent study showed that this variant was found not to
interfere with OAS1 enzyme activity [44].

Another important element of the innate immune system is mannose-binding protein (soluble
mannose-binding lectin) which is encoded by the MBL2 gene. The protein recognizes mannose
and N-acetylglucosamine expressed on the surface of many microorganisms, and is capable of
activating the classical complement pathway. Deficiencies of this gene have been associated with
increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV and other autoimmune and infectious diseases [6].
Interestingly, out of 7 genetic variants that demonstrated delta MAF>0.1 in our study, only
p.Arg52Cys, p.Gly54Asp and p.Gly57Glu in MBL2 were predicted to be probably
damaging/deleterious by prediction algorithms. Moreover, these three variants were already
extensively studied and functionally characterized - they showed compromised oligomerization
and thus the activity of the final protein [45]. In addition to promoter variants, these coding variants
have been shown to influence the stability and serum concentration of the protein, where,
consequently, low levels of MBL2 have been associated with increased susceptibility to infections
[46]. Therefore, the influence of these three variants was studied in various immunological
sceneries, from autoimmune to infections, including SARS-CoV [6, 47]. Nevertheless, all three
variants are found in all analyzed populations, with relatively high MAF values. Interestingly,
p.Gly54Asp and p.Gly57Glu showed extreme MAF values in African compared to other
populations: p.Gly54Asp with MAF ranging from 0.014 in African to 0.219 in Central and South
American and p.Gly57Glu with MAF ranging from 0.0 in Italian and East Asians to 0.259 in
African. Variant p.Arg52Cys showed variable distribution among analyzed populations, having
the highest MAF in Finish (0.11), followed by Serbian population (0.08), while the lowest MAF
was in East Asian and African populations (0.0). Further studies in the populations in which those
variants are frequent could contribute to design of prediction model of the SARS-CoV-2
susceptibility in the carriers of the variants.

Taken altogether, comparing Serbian to other populations, it was found that the highest level of
genetic differentiation related to selected loci was observed with African, followed by East Asian
and South Asian populations. When compared with European populations, the highest divergence
was observed with Italian population.
In conclusion, results of our analysis showed that variants predicted to have altering effect to the
proteins are very rare in each of the selected European populations as well as super-populations.
Thus, although it is not likely to perform massive genetic testing aiming to detect these variants in
order to predict prognosis to COVID-19, they may provide answers for the inter-individual
differences in the clinical course of disease among patients of the same age and the same genetic
background which received identical medical treatment.
On the other hand, variants which have divergent allele frequencies between populations were
mostly predicted to lack effect on the structure and/or the function of the proteins. However, few
variants, such as those in MBL2 gene were predicted to have some functional effect and their
contribution to population differences regarding COVID-19 should be further evaluated.
In general, findings of this study may lead us to conclude that 4 coding variants in genes encoding
proteases (FURIN, PLG and PRSS1) and 6 in genes involved in the innate immunity (MBL2 and
OAS1) could be considered as candidates in forthcoming studies aiming to explain differences in
clinical manifestations, recovery rate and mortality rate of COVID-19 which vary between
different populations [48]. Further genetic analysis of variants in the non-coding regions
(contributing to the fine tuning of the gene expression) of these genes, as well as variants in other
genes, are needed to complement our study and give the complete insight about inter-individual
and population-specific genetic susceptibility and resistance to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. A
