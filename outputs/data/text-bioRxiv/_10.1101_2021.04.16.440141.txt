Abstract

26

The presence of SARS-CoV-2 mutants, including the emerging variant B.1.1.7, has raised

27

great concerns in terms of pathogenesis, transmission, and immune escape. Characterizing

28

SARS-CoV-2 mutations, evolution, and effects on infectivity and pathogenicity is crucial to

29

the design of antibody therapies and surveillance strategies. Here we analyzed 454,443

30

SARS-CoV-2

31

demonstrated that the early variant B.1.1.7 may not have evolved spontaneously in the

32

United Kingdom or within human populations. Our extensive analyses suggested that

33

Canidae, Mustelidae or Felidae, especially the Canidae family (for example, dog) could be a

34

possible host of the direct progenitor of variant B.1.1.7. An alternative hypothesis is that the

35

variant was simply yet to be sampled. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 whole genome represents a

36

large number of potential co-mutations with very strong statistical significances (p value<E–

37

44). In addition, we used an experimental SARS-CoV-2 reporter replicon system to introduce

38

the dominant co-mutations NSP12_c14408t, 5’UTR_c241t, and NSP3_c3037t into the viral

39

genome, and to monitor the effect of the mutations on viral replication. Our experimental

40

results demonstrated that the co-mutations significantly attenuated the viral replication. The

41

study provides valuable clues for discovering the transmission chains of variant B.1.1.7 and

42

understanding the evolutionary process of SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction

46

Since the outbreak in December 2019, COVID-19 has been pandemic in over 200

47

countries. Cases of infection and mortalities have been surging and are an ongoing threat to

48

public health1,2. COVID-19 is caused by infection with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-23-5.

49

Although as a coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has genetic proofreading mechanisms6-8, the

50

persistent natural selection pressure in the population drives the virus to gradually

51

accumulate favorable mutations6,9,10. Much attention has been paid to the mutations and

52

evolution of SARS-CoV-211-15, since mutations are related to the infectivity and pathogenicity

53

of viruses16-21. Beneficial mutants of the virus can better evolve and adapt to the host 9, either

54

strengthening or weakening the infectivity and pathogenicity. In addition, certain variants

55

may generate drug resistance and reduce the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics 22-26. In

56

short, studying mutations and evolution in detail is vital to understand the transformations of

57

viral properties and to control the pandemic.

58

A new variant of SARS-CoV-2 named VOC-202012/01 (Variant of Concern 202012/01) or

59

lineage B.1.1.7 was first detected in the United Kingdom last December 27. It appears to be

60

substantially more transmissible than other variants28. The variant has been growing

61

exponentially in the United Kingdom and rapidly spreading to other countries29,30. However,

62

it is not yet clear if it evolved spontaneously in the United Kingdom or was imported from

63

other countries. Studying how the variant B.1.1.7 mutates can enable researchers to track its

64

spread over time and to understand the evolution of SARS-CoV-2.

65

In this study, large-scale SARS-CoV-2 sequences, consisting of more than 454,000 spike

66

genes/proteins and 14,000 whole-genome sequences were analyzed. Our extensive

67

sequence analysis showed that many mutations always co-occur not only in the spike

68

protein of B.1.1.7, but in the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2. The mutation trajectories of

69

the spike protein indicate that the early variant B.1.1.7 did not evolve spontaneously in the

70

United Kingdom or even within human populations. We also investigated possible

71

SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains of the variant B.1.1.7 based on the mutation analysis of

72

large-scale spike proteins and the cluster analysis of spike genes. Over the whole genome,

73

the top 25 high-frequency mutations of SARS-CoV-2 converged into several potential

74

co-mutation patterns, each of which showed a strong correlation with a very strong

75

statistical significance (p value<E–44). The potential co-mutations depicted the

76

evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the population, shaping variable replication

77

of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, we further explored the effect of the dominant (co-)mutations

78

5'UTR_c241t, NSP3_c3037t, and NSP12_c14408t on viral replication using a

79

SARS-CoV-2 replicon based on a four plasmid in-vitro ligation system. The results

80

suggest that such mutations significantly attenuate the replication of SARS-CoV-2.

82

Evolutionary trajectories of variant B.1.1.7

83

The variant B.1.1.7 was generally defined by multiple amino acid changes including 3

84

deletions (69-70del and 145del) and 7 mutations (N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T716I,

85

S982A, and D1118H) in the spike protein31. The number of non-adjacent co-occurrent

86

changes indicates that they resulted from accumulated mutations. We therefore explored the

87

evolutionary trajectories of B.1.1.7 by tracing the incremental mutations (Fig. 1a). All routes

88

along the directions of the arrows are possible evolutionary trajectories of lineage B.1.1.7.

89

Among all the mutation routes, the green one was the most probable mutation trajectory

90

based on the number of variant strains. However, it was unlikely that the earliest variant

91

B.1.1.7 (GISAID: EPI_ISL_601443, 2020-09-20, England) with 9 mutations evolved from the

92

existing variants with 3–8 mutations, because the former arose much earlier than the latter.

93

More than 454,000 SARS-CoV-2 strains have been collected and extensive sequenced from

94

infected humans without finding intermediate variants with 3–9 mutations. It is therefore

95

unlikely that the intermediate variants with 3–8 mutations have infected humans. Thus, the

96

early variant B.1.1.7 might not have arisen spontaneously in the UK or within human

97

populations. An alternative hypothesis is that spillover likely occurred from susceptible

98

animals.

99

The co-appearance rates (see Materials and Methods) of all nine mutations are shown in

100

Fig. 1b. We found that at least five mutations (145del, A570D, T716I, S982A, and D1118H)

101

of variant B.1.1.7 significantly co-occurred (rate>95%), which indicates a potential

102

co-mutation pattern in the spike protein, causing us to wonder what selection pressure drove

103

such co-occurrences of mutations and rapid evolution in the population of SARS-CoV-2.

104

Note that coronaviruses generally tend to exhibit rapid evolution when they jump to a

105

different species32. We therefore analyzed the key spike genes and proteins of existing

106

SARS-CoV-2 strains collected from animals to find a possible direct progenitor of variant

107

B.1.1.7. The variant with mutations “56” (labeled by “*” in Fig. 1a, termed star variant) had

108

the minimum phylogenetic distance with EPI_ISL_699508, which was collected from a dog

109

on 2020-07-28 (Fig. 2) using MEGA33,34 (see Materials and Methods). The strains collected

110

from tigers, minks, and cats were also close to the star variant. Our extensive analyses

111

including mutations, phylogeny (Fig. 2), collection date/location and the number of

112

sequences (Tables S1-S3) suggested that Canidae, Mustelidae or Felidae, especially the

113

Canidae family (for example, dog) could be a possible host of the direct progenitor of variant

114

B.1.1.7. The possible transmission chains of variant B.1.1.7 are shown in Fig. 1c. This star

115

variant strains in humans could not have evolved into the early variant B.1.1.7, but they

116

might have infected high-density yet susceptible animals (such as dogs) and adapted to

117

these species through rapid mutation. Such progenitor variants comprised most or all of the

118

mutations of the early variant B.1.1.7 within the Canidae family populations, and they may

119

have spilled back to humans after the rapid mutation period.

120

High-frequency mutations converge into potential co-mutations

121

Based on sequence alignment and mutation analysis, we found that 7,441 nucleotide

122

alterations in the viral 29903-letter RNA code occurred at least once in the samples from

123

COVID-19 patients. These mutations were dispersed in the 14,427 SARS-CoV-2 strains

124

collected from all around the world. As shown in the heatmap of the top 1% high-frequency

125

mutations (Table S4), some sites show very similar mutation rates on most days in samples

126

isolated globally (Fig. S1), including 8,898 and 815 samples isolated from the U.S. (Fig. S2)

127

and Australia (Fig. S3). Therefore, these mutations shown in Fig. S4a were selected and

128

clustered into co-occurrences, which we called potential co-mutation patterns. From the

129

landscape of the mutation rates (Fig. S4a), 25 nucleotide sites were clearly clustered into

130

several potential co-mutation patterns. Among these patterns, there was one consisting of

131

the top 4 high-frequency mutations (i.e., 5’UTR_c241t, NSP3_c3037t, NSP12_c14408t, and

132

S_a23403g), which converged into a dominant potential co-mutation pattern. Such

133

co-occurrence lineage has been found in almost all sequenced samples of SARS-CoV-2.

134

Within this co-occurrence pattern, mutation S_ a23403g resulted in the amino acid change

135

(D614G) that apparently enhances viral infectivity6,35, albeit debate exists16. Notably, there

136

were three successive sites at the 28881st to 28883rd positions of the virus (N_g28881a,

137

N_g28882a, and N_g28883c) that strictly co-occurred. Comparing Fig. S4a-c and Table S4,

138

we found that the top 14 high-frequency mutations formed five common co-occurrence

139

patterns.

140

To assess the above co-occurrence patterns, we analyzed the correlations and statistical

141

significance levels of the high-frequency co-occurrence mutations. The heatmap of the

142

paired Pearson-correlation-coefficients (Fig. 3a) shows that the top 25 high-frequency

143

mutations clearly cluster into several potential co-mutation groups/patterns with very strong

144

correlation (0.8). By regression analyses, the above co-occurrence patterns have statistical

145

significance levels with p values less than 10-44 (Fig. 3b). The detailed mutation transitions

146

(Fig. 3c–k, Figs. S5–7) provide further evidence that the above mutations form co-mutation

147

patterns.

148

Dominant mutations attenuate viral replication

149

We further explored the effect of the dominant mutations 5'UTR_c241t, NSP3_c3037t,

150

and NSP12_c14408t on viral replication using a SARS-CoV-2 replicon based on a

151

four-plasmid in-vitro ligation system. This replicon is devoid of the viral structural proteins

152

while undergoing viral replication, and the viral replication is sensitive to the antiviral agent

153

remdesivir36. The 5'UTR_c241t mutation resides in a highly conserved region in the 5'UTR

154

(Fig. 4a). The NSP3_c3037t mutation is synonymous. The NSP12_c14408t mutation is

155

nonsynonymous with an amino acid change of a conserved amino acid P323 in the viral

156

RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Fig. 4b). We introduced the NSP12_c14408t mutation or

157

the NSP12_c14408t mutation with the other two mutations 5'UTR_c241t and NSP3_c3037t

158

into the replicon plasmids. The fragments were released from the plasmids by BsaI digestion,

159

and then assembled by in-vitro ligation with T4 ligase (Fig. 4c). Replicon RNA transcribed

160

from the ligation products was co-transfected with N mRNA into Huh7 cells. RNA replication

161

was monitored by measuring the secreted Gaussia luciferase activity in the supernatants.

162

Enzymatic dead mutants (759-SAA-761) of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase NSP12

163

were introduced, and the mutated replicon served as a non-replication control. As shown in

164

Fig. 4d, transfection of WT replicon RNA resulted in an obvious increase of luciferase activity,

165

and SAA RNA did not replicate as expected. Introduction of NSP12_c14408t mutation

166

resulted in a significant reduction of viral replication. The combination of NSP12_c14408t

167

mutation with the other two mutations further significantly but only marginally reduced viral

168

replication. These results demonstrate that the P323L mutation in the viral RNA-dependent

169

RNA polymerase reduces viral replication, and the synonymous mutations may further

170

attenuate viral replication.

Discussion

172

A well-resolved phylogeny of variant B.1.1.7 spike genes provides an opportunity to

173

understand the evolutionary process and transmission chains of variant B.1.1.7. Our

174

incremental mutation and phylogenetic analyses on large-scale SARS-CoV-2 spike

175

proteins/genes revealed that the early variant B.1.1.7 might not have evolved spontaneously

176

in the United Kingdom or within human populations. In this case the spillover likely occurred

177

from susceptible animals. Current evidence37-39 indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can effectively

178

infect both domestic animals (for example, dog, cat, pig and bovine) and wild animals (for

179

example, mink, rabbit and fox) by binding their angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

180

Our further analyses including mutations, phylogeny, collection date/location and the

181

number of sequences suggested that the earliest variant B.1.1.7 possibly originated from

182

Canidae, Mustelidae or Felidae, especially the Canidae family (for example, dog). The

183

cases40 that the variant B.1.1.7 can easily infect dogs and cats indicated that both are

184

susceptible to B.1.1.7. Still, due to the limited information available to date, an alternative

185

hypothesis is that the direct progenitor of variant B.1.1.7 is yet to be sampled. In addition to

186

variant B.1.1.7, as a future topic we will work on the analysis of other lineages such as P.1,

187

B.1.351, B.1.427, and B.1.42, when sufficient numbers of their sequences are available.

188

By tracing the mutation trajectories, we found that at least five mutations of the spike

189

proteins always co-occurred, and a large number of potential co-mutations appeared in the

190

top 1% high-frequency mutations of SARS-CoV-2 whole genome. It has been documented

191

that the mutation S_ a23403g results in the amino acid change of the spike protein D614G

192

and enhances viral infectivity19,41-44. Here, by using a SARS-CoV-2 reporter replicon system,

193

we demonstrated that the one of the dominant co-mutations NSP12_c14408t significantly

194

reduced viral replication and combination of NSP12_c14408t mutation with the other two

195

synonymous mutations 5’UTR_c241t and NSP3_c3037t although significantly but only

196

marginally reduced viral replication further. As the 5’UTR play an important role in regulating

197

viral replication, the synonymous mutations 5’UTR_c241t may attenuate viral replication by

198

change RNA secondary structure45. These findings imply that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes an

199

evolution toward enhancing viral infectivity while attenuating viral replication. SARS-CoV-2

200

has exhibited significant mutations and co-mutations. We evaluated the replication of a

201

co-mutation pattern including three dominant mutations. If other mutations act similarly on

202

the viral replication needs to be verified. These results can be further explored for efficient

203

vaccine design in our future work. In summary, this study provides insights into the

204

transmission chains of variant B.1.1.7 and the effect of viral dominant mutations on viral

205

evolution.

Data selection and pre-processing

208

The 454,443 spike gene/protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were obtained at

209

https://www.gisaid.org/. The NCBI website at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sars-cov-2/ has

210

released more than 1.7 thousand sequences of SARS-CoV-2 viruses before July 31, 2020.

211

We selected 14,427 sequences that satisfied two criteria: (1) having specific collection dates;

212

(2) sequence-lengths being no less than 29,305 nt (29903*0.98). It is inevitable that some

213

sites of sequences are equivocal owing to the limitation of sequencing depth. For instance,

214

many sites were labeled as letter N in genome sequences. The noise of indeterminate

215

nucleic-acids was taken into consideration in our experiments so as to boost accuracy. The

216

co-mutation rate of multi-site co-mutations was calculated by co − mutation rate =

217

number of sequences containing co−mutaions
number of all sequences

. Moreover, the co-appearance rate of a mutation in
number of B.1.1.7 sequences

218

B.1.1.7 variant was defined by co − appearance rate = number of sequences containing a mutation.

219

Possible animal host analyses

220

In addition to the phylogenetic analysis, we further explored the possible animal hosts of

221

the direct progenitor of variant B.1.1.7 by mutations, collection time/space of strains, the

222

number of sequences and the edit distance46,47 of mutations (Table S1-2). Due the late

223

lockdown policies of some governmental agencies, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has not been

224

prevented well in Europe, America, and Australia. We could ignore the impact of policies for

225

studying the origin of variant B.1.1.7. We quantified the multiple impact factors of viral

226

transmission as shown in Table S3 based on the criterion that the smaller the value, the

227

more similar. The results still supported that the Canidae family is a possible host of the

228

direct progenitor of variant B.1.1.7.

The Pearson-correlation-coefficient (PCC) is a classic statistic that measures linear

correlation between two variables. Its value ranges from -1.0 to 1.0. Normally, the two

243

variables meet a strong correlation or a very strong correlation when the absolutes value of

244

PCC is between 0.6 and 0.8 or between 0.8 and 1.0. Linear regression is a linear approach

245

to model the relationship between a scalar response and one or more variables. We used

PCC and significance level (p value) of regression analysis to evaluate the relationships of

In-vitro ligation

259

BsaI digested fragments were gel purified using Gel Extraction Kit (OMEGA) and ligated

260

with T4 ligase (New England Biolabs) at room temperature for 1 h. The ligation products

261

were phenol/chloroform extracted, precipitated by absolute ethanol, and resuspended in

262

nuclease-free water, quantified by determining the A260 absorbance.

263

In-vitro transcription

264

Purified in-vitro ligated product was used as template for the in-vitro transcription by

265

mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Transcription Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s

266

protocol. For N mRNA production, we amplified the N coding region by PCR (sense: GGC

Fig. 1 Evolutionary trajectories of variant B.1.1.7. a Incremental mutations of variant B.1.1.7. The

404

digits in the upper-right-corner rectangle with dotted line indicate the labels of mutations. For

405

simplicity, the 69–70 deletions were labeled as “1”, and the other mutations “2”-“9” respectively. The

406

bottom nodes (rectangles) represent the variants with one mutation and the top one was the early

407

variant B.1.1.7. Each rectangle with solid line consists of lineage (e.g., B.1.243), number of strains

408

(e.g., N:2382), mutation sites (e.g., M:----56---), the earliest collection date (e.g., 20-03-29, i.e.,

409

2020-03-29), and collection location (e.g., USA). In the labels of the mutation sites, sign “-” indicated

410

the corresponding site did not mutate. All routes along the directions of the arrows are possible

411

evolutionary trajectories of lineage B.1.1.7, where the green one was the most probable mutation

412

trajectory. Large-scale SARS-CoV-2 analysis demonstrates that the early variant B.1.1.7 might not

413

have arisen spontaneously in the UK or within human hosts. b Coappearances of variant B.1.1.7

Fig. 2 The Canidae family could be a possible host of the direct progenitor of variant B.1.1.7.

420

The digits on the left of the figure indicate the labels of mutations, which correspond with the

421

mutation labels in Fig. 1a. The strains shown in the center of the figure contain at least one spike

422

mutation of variant B.1.1.7. And these strain examples cover all existing SARS-CoV-2 viruses that

423

collected from animal hosts. The strain labeled by orange star corresponds with the star variant in Fig.

424

1a. The strain with orange solid-round label was collected from a dog on 2020-07-28. Such two

425

strains share the same mutations “56” and have the minimum phylogenetic distance by MEGA tool.

426

Canidae, Mustelidae or Felidae, especially the Canidae family (for example, dog) could be a possible

427

host of the direct progenitor of variant B.1.1.7 based on existing stains collected before the end of

428

Jan. 2021.

Fig. 3 The strong correlations suggest that the top 25 mutations form eight potential

431

co-mutation patterns. a The correlation heatmap of the top 25 mutations. These mutations could be

432

grouped into several clusters with high Pearson-correlation-coefficient (PCC). b Regression analysis

433

of mutations shows that eight clusters all denote the statistical significance level: ***p value < E-44. c

434

to k show the transitions of the high-frequency mutations. The sky-blue represents the rate per day of

435

initial residue in population and the golden the rate per day of substitution/mutant. These mutation

436

transitions provide further evidence that the above mutations potentially form co-mutation patterns.

Fig. 4 Dominant co-mutation attenuates viral replication. a Predicted RNA structure of the

439

SARS-CoV-2 5’UTR. RNA structure of the 400-nt 5’UTR was predicted by “RNAstructure”

440

(http://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/RNAstructureWeb). The start codon for nsp1 is grey, the TRS-L is

441

orange, and the mutated nucleotides are red. The bottom panel shows the alignment of the 5’UTR of

442

SARS-CoV-2 with 5’UTRs of related viruses, with c241 highlighted. b Structure of SARS-CoV-2

443

RdRp/RNA complex. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp/RNA complex (PDB, 6X2G) was visualized

444

by Chimera (UCSF). The P323 mutation is highlighted in red, with the alignment of the amino acid

445

sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses near the P323 position. c Schematic of the in-vitro

446

ligation system for SARS-CoV-2 replicon. Four plasmids encompassing the viral genome were

447

digested by BsaI to release the four fragments. After gel purification, the fragments were ligated by

448

T4 ligase. The ligation products were purified and used as template for RNA in-vitro transcription.

450

blasticidin. d Huh7 cells were co-transfected with in-vitro transcribed replicon RNA (WT or the

451

indicated mutants) and an mRNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. The luciferase activity in the

452

supernatants was measured at the time points indicated. Medium was changed at 8 hours

453

post-transfection. Data are shown as mean±SEM (n=8). SAA, the NSP12 polymerase active-site

454

mutant. Unpaired Student’s t-test was performed between the mutants and wild type (WT) and

455

between the mutants as indicated (statistical significance level: *p value<0.05, **p value<0.01, ***p

456

value<0.001).
