Abstract
Drug repositioning represents an effective way to control the current COVID-19 pandemic.
Previously, we identified 24 FDA-approved drugs which exhibited substantial antiviral effect
against SARS-CoV-2 in Vero cells. Since antiviral efficacy could be altered in different cell
lines, we developed an antiviral screening assay with human lung cells, which is more
appropriate than Vero cell. Comparative analysis of antiviral activities revealed that nafamostat
is the most potent drug in human lung cells (IC50 = 0.0022µM).

COVID-19 is an emerging infectious disease caused by a coronavirus (1). The causative virus
was named as SARS-CoV-2 because it is very similar to SARS-CoV (79.5%) and this virus
belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus within the Coronaviridae family (2). Both SARS- and
MERS-CoV also belong to the same Betacoronavirus genus.
Neither vaccine nor therapeutic has been developed for SARS- and MERS-CoV and the current
standard of care for the patients with COVID-19 is just supportive care. However, numerous
clinical trials are ongoing globally with FDA-approved drugs as drug repositioning programs
(https://www.covid-trials.org/). Among these drugs, (hydroxy)chloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir,
and remdesivir are those that are the most frequently being tested worldwide due to the wellknown in vitro antiviral effects on both MERS- and SARS-CoV and even on SARS-CoV-2 (3).
In our previous drug repositioning study, we identified a total of 24 potential antiviral drug
candidates from FDA-approved drugs (4). These drugs showed very potent antiviral efficacy
against SARS-CoV-2 (0.1 µM < IC50 < 10 µM) in the experiments using Vero cells. Although
Vero cells are commonly used for virus infection and propagation, they were originally isolated
from the African green monkey kidney, thus do not represent the respiratory cells from the
human lung, which is the main target tissue for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we
compared the antiviral efficacy of the 24 potential antiviral drug candidates against SARS-CoV2 using Calu-3 human lung cells. Calu-3 was originally isolated from human lung
adenocarcinoma and is a well-characterized epithelial cell line (5).
In order to conduct the dose-response curve (DRC) analysis with drugs, Calu-3 cells were treated
with each drug candidate 24 h prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The infected cells were incubated
for another 24 h and then fixed for immunofluorescence. Both viral N protein and host cell
nucleus were stained by immunofluorescence and the quantitative analysis to measure the
inhibition of virus infection and the cell viability due to drug treatment was conducted using our
in-house image mining (IM) software.
The DRC analysis of the reference drugs (i.e., chloroquine, lopinavir, and remdesivir) (Fig. 1)
showed differences in IC50 in between Vero and Calu-3 cells. While the IC50 values of both
chloroquine and lopinavir increased by ~ 10 fold and ~ 2 fold, respectively (Table 1), the IC50 of
remdesivir rather decreased by 10 fold compared to that with Vero cells, perhaps due to the low
metabolic capacity in Vero cells (6)(Table 2). These discrepancies might in part account for the

different outcomes from numerous clinical trials using chloroquine, lopinavir, and remdesivir. So
far, the treatment with (hydroxy)chloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir did not show any promising
results concerning the COVID-19 treatment (7)(8); however remdesivir seems to be effective for
treatment of patients with COVID-19 in certain clinical settings
(https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/coronavirus-drug-remdesivir-shows-promiselarge-trial-n1195171).
Interestingly, the IC50 values of most drugs in our study increased in varying degrees in Calu-3
cells (Fig. 2A and C) (Table 1 and 3). Only 5 drugs showed decreases in IC50 (Fig. 2B) (Table 2):
Nafamostat mesylate, Remdesivir, Hydroxyprogesterone caproate, Digitoxin, Cyclosporine.
Although nafamostat mesylate was not included in our earlier study, we compared the antiviral
efficacy of this drug at this time in between Vero and Calu-3 cells following the discovery that
TMPRSS2, a host protease necessary for priming viral spike glycoprotein, could be a target for
COVID-19 antiviral development (9). The discrepancy in IC50 was remarkable with nafamostat
mesylate; the IC50 decreased by ~ 6,000 fold when the drug was used in the SARS-CoV-2infected Calu-3 cells perhaps due to the dominant role of TMPRSS2-dependent viral entry in the
Calu-3 human lung epithelial cells (10)(11). In addition, the IC50 of nafamostat mesylate was
exceptionally low (0.0022 µM), which indicates that nafamostat mesylate is ~ 600-fold more
potent than remdesivir in Calu-3 cells. It became more apparent that blood clotting is one of the
complicating manifestations in patients with COVID-19 (12)(13), and nafamostat mesylate may
play dual roles not only as an antiviral to block viral entry but also as an anticoagulant to remove
blood clots frequently associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In summary, we compared antiviral efficacy of the potential antiviral drug candidates against
SARS-CoV-2 in between Vero and Calu-3 cells and found that nafamostat mesylate is the most
potent antiviral drug candidate in vitro. Importantly, nafamostat mesylate has been approved for
human use in Japan and Korea for over a decade, thus it can be readily repurposed for COVID19 following phase II-III clinical trials. Currently, a few clinical trials has been registered
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/). According to our results, although in vivo animal models are
preferred experimental systems for evaluating antiviral efficacy, in vitro testing using human
lung cells is a viable option in addition to the commonly used Vero or VeroE6 cells for
assessment of antiviral efficacy when the animal models are not readily available.

Materials and Methods
Virus and Cells
Calu-3 used in this study is a clonal isolate, which shows higher growth rate compared to the
parental Calu-3 obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CCL-81). Calu-3
was maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2 in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM, ATCC),
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1X AntibioticAntimycotic solution (Gibco). SARS-CoV-2 (βCoV/KOR/KCDC03/2020) was provided by
Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), and was propagated in Vero cells.
Viral titers were determined by plaque assays in Vero cells. All experiments using SARS-CoV-2
were performed at Institut Pasteur Korea in compliance with the guidelines of the KNIH, using
enhanced Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) containment procedures in laboratories approved for use by
the KCDC.
Reagents
Chloroquine diphosphate (CQ; C6628) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO),
lopinavir (LPV; S1380) was purchased from SelleckChem (Houston, TX), and remdesivir (HY104077) was purchased from MedChemExpress (Monmouth Junction, NJ). Chloroquine was
dissolved in Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline (DPBS; Welgene), and all other reagents
were dissolved in DMSO for the screening. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 N protein antibody was
purchased from Sino Biological Inc. (Beijing, China). Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H +
L) secondary antibody and Hoechst 33342 were purchased from Molecular Probes.
Paraformaldehyde (PFA) (32% aqueous solution) and normal goat serum were purchased from
Electron Microscopy Sciences (Hatfield, PA) and Vector Laboratories, Inc. (Burlingame, CA),
respectively.
Dose-response curve (DRC) analysis by immunofluorescence
Ten-point DRCs were generated for each drug. Calu-3 cells were seeded at 2.0 × 104 cells per
well in EMEM, supplemented with 10% FBS and 1X Antibiotic-Antimycotic solution (Gibco) in
black, 384-well, μClear plates (Greiner Bio-One), 24 h prior to the experiment. Ten-point DRCs

were generated, with compound concentrations ranging from 0.1-50 μM. For viral infection,
plates were transferred into the BSL-3 containment facility and SARS-CoV-2 was added at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. The cells were fixed at 24 hpi with 4% PFA and analyzed
by immunofluorescence. The acquired images were analyzed using in-house software to quantify
cell numbers and infection ratios, and antiviral activity was normalized to positive (mock) and
negative (0.5% DMSO) controls in each assay plate. DRCs were generated in Prism7
(GraphPad) software, with dose-response-inhibition nonlinear regression analysis. IC50 and CC50
values were obtained with the identical analysis method. Mean values of independent duplicate
experiments were used for analysis. Each assay was controlled by Z'-factor and the coefficient of
variation in percent (%CV).
