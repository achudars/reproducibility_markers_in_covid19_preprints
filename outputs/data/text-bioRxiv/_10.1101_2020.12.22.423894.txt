ABSTRACT

21

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, over 200 vaccine candidates have been documented

22

and some of them have advanced to clinical trials with encouraging results. However,

23

the antibody persistence over 3 months post immunization and the long-term memory

24

have been rarely reported. Here, we report that a ferritin nanoparticle based SARS-

25

CoV-2 RBD vaccine induced in mice an efficient antibody response which lasts for at

26

least 7 months post immunization. Significantly higher number of memory B cells were

27

maintained and a significantly higher level of recall response was induced upon antigen

28

challenge. Thus, we believe our current study provide the first information about the

29

long-term antibody persistence and memory response of a COVID-19 vaccine. This

30

information would be also timely useful for the development and evaluation of other

31

vaccines.

INTRODUCTION

38

Since the reported outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

39

CoV-2) infection in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has quickly spread over the world.

40

To date, more than 70 million infection cases have been reported with over 1.6 million

41

deaths (World Health Organization). So far, there is still no effective treatments

42

available. A safe and effective vaccine is highly demanded 1.

43
44

For an effective vaccine, antibody persistence and long-term memory are favorable

45

features 2. The poor antibody persistence during natural SARS-CoV-2 infection raised

46

concerns whether a vaccine could induce a long-lasting antibody response and whether

47

memory recall response would be induced upon reinfection

48

vaccine candidates have been documented and some of them have advanced to clinical

49

trials with encouraging results 5. However, to our knowledge, none of them has reported

50

the antibody persistence over 3 months post immunization, and the long-term memory

51

is also unclear 6-18. Here, we report that a ferritin nanoparticle based SARS-CoV-2 RBD

52

vaccine induced in mice an efficient antibody response which lasts for at least 7 months

53

post immunization. Significantly higher number of memory B cells were maintained

54

and a significantly higher level of recall response was induced upon antigen challenge.

. Currently, over 200

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

57

Molecular design and characterization of Ferritin-NP-RBD vaccine

58

SpyTag/SpyCatcher technique based click vaccine platform has been developed and

59

widely used in our lab, which achieves rapid and convenient production of nanoparticle

60

vaccines 19,20. The same strategy was applied for the construction of ferritin NP based

61

SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) vaccine (Fig. 1a). SpyTag was

62

genetically fused to the C-terminus of SARS-CoV-2 S RBD and the fusion protein was

63

expressed in 293F. Due to glycosylation modification, the apparent molecular weight

64

of RBD-SpyTag was about 35kDa (actual molecular mass was 27.4 kDa). Purified

65

RBD-SpyTag was mixed with SpyCatcher-ferritin NP at different ratios. SpyTag and

66

SpyCatcher mediated covalent conjugation was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. The ferritin-

67

NP-RBD was further purified by size exclusion chromatography. SDS-PAGE analysis

68

confirmed the purity of ferritin-NP-RBD.

69
70

Ferritin-NP-RBD vaccine induces efficient antibody response

71

To assess the immunogenicity of the ferritin-NP-RBD, naïve wild type (WT) C57BL/6

72

mice were immunized with ferritin-NP-RDB vaccine or equimolar RBD-SpyTag as

73

control in the presence of CpG-1826 adjuvant at day 0, 14 and 28 (Fig. 1b). Ferritin-

74

NP-RBD vaccine induced an approximate 100-fold higher antibody level than soluble

75

RBD-SpyTag at day 28 (Fig. 1c). After the third immunization, the control vaccine

76

group reached to about 105 antibody titers at day 35, and ferritin-NP-RBD group

77

reached to about 106 antibody titers (Fig. 1c). Thus, RBD conjugated to ferritin-NP

78

greatly enhanced the immunogenicity of RBD antigen and elicited a dramatically

79

enhanced RBD specific antibody response.

80
81

Protective immunity of ferritin-NP-RBD vaccine against SARS-CoV-2

82

To test whether RBD antisera induced by the ferritin-NP-RBD vaccine could provide

83

protection against the live SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, vero cells were infected with live

84

SARS-CoV-2 (C-Tan-nCoV strain 04) in the presence of day 35 sera from different

85

immunization groups. The results showed that four out of five mice from RBD-SpyTag

86

group neutralized over 50% live-virus at serum dilutions ranged from only 1:100 to

87

1:400, with average 50% microneutralisation (MN50) titer was 103.8/ml (Fig. 1f,g).

88

Strikingly, all of five mice from ferritin-NP-RBD vaccine group had neutralization

89

effect at serum dilutions ranged from 1:1600 to 1:3200, with average MN50 of 104.8/ml

90

(Fig. 1f,g). These results confirm that the antisera to RBD elicited by the ferritin-NP-

91

RBD vaccine can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection much more effectively in vitro.

92
93

Ferritin-NP-RBD vaccine induces persistent antibody response and memory

94

response

95

To determine the antibody persistence induced by ferritin-NP-RBD vaccine in mice, we

96

continued to monitor the antibody responses at 5 months, 6 months and 7 months after

97

the first immunization. The anti-RBD level at 5 months was almost comparable to the

98

level of day 35 (Fig. 1c). At 6 and 7 months, while the antibody endpoint titers of both

99

groups gradually dropped, ferritin-NP-RBD vaccine group still maintained

100

significantly higher level of anti-RBD than the RBD-SpyTag control vaccine group (Fig.

101

1c), confirming the benefit of ferritin-NP for maintaining antibody response. To further

102

determine whether ferritin-NP promotes better memory response, we first examined the

103

RBD-specific memory B cells (MBCs) in the blood. Significantly more RBD-specific

104

MBCs were generated and maintained at 6 months in ferritin-NP-RBD group compared

105

with RBD-SpyTag control group (Fig. 1f,g). Consistent with the enhanced MBC

106

formation and maintenance, when mice were challenged with RBD vaccine antigen at

107

day 210, ferritin-NP-RBD group elicited a dramatically increased antibody recall

108

response, 2000 times stronger than that in control group (Fig. 1c). Thus, Ferritin-NP-

109

RBD vaccine induced not only a persistent RBD-specific antibody response but also

110

long-term memory.

111
112

Self-assembling ferritin NPs have recently become widely used for vaccine design

113

19,21-24

. It also emerged as an attractive platform for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design 10. In

114

this study, a similar approach was used for vaccine construction as we used previously

115

and here 19,20. Upon two immunizations, about 105 titers of RBD-specific anti-IgG was

116

detected. In our study, an average of 2.2×105 titers of antisera were induced upon two

117

immunizations, and about 106 titers of antisera were induced upon three immunizations.

118

Given such impressive primary antibody response, we have further monitored antibody

119

persistence and memory response throughout 7 months, which is so far the longest

120

reported period for COVID-19 vaccine evaluation, to our knowledge. The extended

121

antibody persistence and well-boosted recall antibody response as demonstrated in

ELISA

181

For the RBD-specific ELISA, 5 g/ml RBD-SpyTag protein produced in our lab was

182

coated onto 96-well high binding Costar® Assay plates (CORNING) at 4 °C overnight.

183

After blocking with a blocking buffer (PBS containing 5% FBS), serum samples with

184

different dilutions were added onto the plates. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)

185

conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (1:5000, ZSGB-BIO) was used as

186

second antibody. The concentration of specific antibodies was measured using TMB

187

substrate (SeraCare) and the absorbance at 450 nm-630 nm was detected by a

188

Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices).

Live SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay

191

The experiment was conducted in a BSL-3 laboratory, as previously reported

192

Brieﬂy, the sera were 2-fold serially diluted using 2% FBS-DMEM and mixed with the

193

same volume of live SARS-CoV-2 (C-Tan-nCoV strain 04, 100TCID50), the mixtures

194

were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, following which they were added to the seeded Vero

195

cells. After incubation at 37 °C for 48 h, CPE was observed, and 100 μL of the culture

196

supernatant was harvested for nucleic acid extraction and realtime ﬂuorescence RT-

197

PCR reaction. Median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of the virus in the sample

198

was calculated according to the CT value of the sample and standard curve. The

199

neutralization potency (or inhibition rate) was calculated as follows: Inhibition ratio =

200

(TCID50 without serum - TCID50 with serum)/TCID50 without serum *100%. The

201

median micro-neutralization dose (MN50) was calculated by Reed-Munch method.

208

binding. For RBD-specific memory B cells (MBC) staining, biotin conjugated

209

recombinant RBD protein was incubated with cell suspensions together with

210

fluorescence-conjugated antibodies, then RDB binding cells were recognized by

211

APC/Cy7 Streptavidin (Biolegend). The antibodies used included anti-B220-PE (RA3-

212

6B2, eBioscience), anti-CD38-APC (90, eBioscience), anti-IgM-PE/Cy7 (II/41,

213

eBioscience) and anti-IgD-PerCP/Cy5.5 (11-26c.2a, Biolegend). The working

214

concentration of the antibodies is 2.5 g /ml.
