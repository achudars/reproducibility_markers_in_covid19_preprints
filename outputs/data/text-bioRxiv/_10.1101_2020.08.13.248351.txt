Abstract

18

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and recombinant ACE2

19

decoys are being evaluated as new antiviral therapies. We designed and tested an antibody-like ACE2-Fc

20

fusion protein, which has the benefit of long pharmacological half-life and the potential to facilitate immune

21

clearance of the virus. Out of a concern that the intrinsic catalytic activity of ACE2 may unintentionally alter

22

the balance of its hormonal substrates and cause adverse cardiovascular effects in treatment, we performed

23

a mutagenesis screening for inactivating the enzyme. Three mutants, R273A, H378A and E402A, completely

24

lost their enzymatic activity for either surrogate or physiological substrates. All of them remained capable of

25

binding SARS-CoV-2 and could suppress the transduction of a pseudotyped virus in cell culture. This study

26

established new ACE2-Fc candidates as antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2 without potentially harmful side

27

effects from ACE2’s catalytic actions toward its vasoactive substrates.

1. Introduction

32

As COVID-19 pandemic is still unfolding and no specific antiviral treatments are available, there is an

33

unmet need to explore new drug candidates that are effective and safe, and broad spectrum against the

34

evolving virus. In addition to the ongoing clinical trials of repurposed compounds and patient-derived

35

antibodies, new drugs are being developed through targeted screening and rational design.

36

One of the focuses is on drug candidates that target receptor-mediated viral entry. A diverse group of

37

human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV of 2002, HCoV-NL63 of 2004 and SARS-CoV-2 of COVID-19 rely on

38

their spike proteins to bind ACE2 cell receptor as the first step in viral entry[1-4]. It has been shown that

39

soluble ACE2 at generous abundance as compared to viral concentration can lower infectivity of cultured

40

human cells, similar to experimental anti-spike antibodies[5-7]. Prior to the pandemic, one of the human

41

recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) drugs developed by Apeiron Biologics and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) had

42

completed Phase I and Phase II clinical trials for human pulmonary arterial hypertension and acute

43

respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [8, 9], and is now repositioned for investigational treatment of COVID-

44

19 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04335136).

45

The current focus has been on improving binding affinity, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD),

46

antiviral specificity and neutralization efficacy of ACE2-based biologics through bioengineering design[6, 10-

47

12]. Also in a different context unrelated to COVID-19, our group had previously constructed a chimeric

48

fusion between the ectodomain of ACE2 and the Fc segment of IgG1 (“hinge” plus CH2 and CH3 regions)

49

(Fig1A). In keeping with a well-recognized function of Fc to extend protein half-life through its cognate

50

neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), ACE2-Fc has improved pharmacokinetics as compared to untagged soluble

51

ACE2[13]. The enzymatic activity of ACE2 in the fusion degraded angiotensin II (AngII) and rendered blood

52

pressure control for up to two weeks. In comparison to its untagged counterpart to treat COVID-19, ACE2-Fc

53

is predicted to offer superior pharmacological benefits, which make it also suitable for prophylactic usages

54

by frontline healthcare workers and caregivers[11].

55

Our study attempts to address another potential drawback of hrsACE2 biologic. Although it was originally

56

believed that the catalytic activity of ACE2 delivered in an excess quantity through therapeutic hrsACE2 may

57

alleviate ARDS based on mouse studies[8, 14], the relevance in human disease remains unclear. COVID-19

58

mortality is prevalent among patients with underlying conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes

59

and chronic lung disease [15-18], a large number of COVID-19 patients are on existing ACEI/ARB blockade

60

therapy for preexisting cardiovascular and diabetic comorbidities[19]. There have been different opinions on

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.13.248351; this version posted August 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

61

whether RAAS blockade medications had improved or worsened COVID-19 recovery[20-24]. However,

62

studies discovered a correlation between RAAS blockade and upregulation of endogenous ACE2 expression,

63

causing concern of increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection[25-29]. The carboxypeptidase activity of

64

therapeutic hrsACE2 hydrolyses a broad range of vasoactive hormonal substrates including AngII, apelin-13,

65

bradykinin, among others, and exerts systemic RAAS blockade that affects the heart, the blood vessels, the

66

kidney and the lung. Severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection frequently have multiorgan involvement [30-34].

67

In our view, the dual functions of investigational drug hrsACE2 to simultaneously act on viral neutralization

68

and RAAS can potentially complicate clinical assessment of therapeutic efficacy. In order to achieve an

69

exclusive antiviral function in an ACE2-derived biologic, we sought to modify ACE2 catalytic center to limit

70

the catalysis of its vasoactive substrates.

71

2. Materials and Methods

72

2.1. Construction of ACE2-Fc mutant plasmids

73

DNA sequence encoding the ectodomain of human ACE2 (aa 1-740) was cloned from a human kidney

74

cDNA library. DNA encoding human Fc of IgG1 has been described previously[13]. An in-frame fusion

75

between ACE2 and Fc was constructed in pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Site-directed

76

mutagenesis by PCR was performed to create the panel of ACE2-Fc mutants. All mutants were confirmed by

77

sequencing.

78

2.2. Recombinant protein expression and purification

79

The workflow for generating recombinant ACE2-Fc variants was similar to what had been reported

80

before[13]. Briefly, HEK293 cells were transfected with individual ACE2-Fc variants by standard

81

polyethylenimine (PEI) method. In transgene transfection studies, on day two of transfection cells were

82

switched to serum-free DMEM. On day four, the culture media were harvested by centrifugation, and

83

further concentrated using Amico Ultra Filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA). ACE2-Fc proteins were then purified

84

by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) using Superdex 200 Increase column (GE healthcare, Chicago, IL)

85

and stored at -80°C until used in experiments.

86

∆ACE2-Fc Arg273Ala, His378Ala and Glu402Ala, and wild-type ACE2-Fc selected for scaled production

87

were produced from clonal stable-expressing cells. The general method was described previously[13].

88

Following plasmid transfection of HEK293 cells, the cells were selected under 1 mg/mL G418 (Thermo Fisher

89

Scientific, Waltham, MA) for ~14 days until isolated cell colonies appeared in the dishes. Individual cell

90

clones were seeded into 96-well plates. When cells reached 50-100% density in the wells, the culture media

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.13.248351; this version posted August 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

91

were tested for their ACE2-Fc contents using a custom ELISA (anti-ACE2 antibody [Abcam, Cambridge, MA]

92

for capturing and anti-human IgG-Fc-HRP [SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL] for detection). Clones with the

93

highest expression of recombinant ACE2-Fc variants were selected, and individually expanded to five 150

94

mm dishes. Once reached ~90% confluency, the cultures were switched to serum-free DMEM medium. After

95

4-5 days the culture media were harvested, and further concentrated using a VIVAFLOW 200 filtration

96

system (100,000 MWCO by Sartorius, Stonehouse, UK). Recombinant ACE2-Fc proteins were purified using

97

SEC as described above.

98

2.3. ACE2 peptidase activity measured using surrogate Mca-APK(Dnp)

99

ACE2-Fc peptidase activity assay using surrogate fluorogenic substrate Mca-APK(Dnp) (Enzo Life Sciences,

100

Farmingdale, NY) was performed in black microtiter plates. The reaction buffer contained 50RmM 4-

101

morpholineethanesulfonic acid, pHR=R6.5, 300RmM NaCl, 10RμM ZnCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100 and 20RμM of

102

Mca-APK(Dnp). The total reaction volume was 100RμL at room temperature and the duration of the

103

reactions were 20 min. Peptidase activities were calculated as fluorescence intensity at 320 nm excitation

104

and 420 nm emission wavelength.

105

2.4. ACE2 peptidase activity measured using physiological substrates of AngII and apelin-13

106

We described the method previously and referred to the workflow as Phenylalanine Assay, which was

107

tested using AngII and apelin-13 as substrates in reactions with ACE2[35]. It involves two coupled reactions,

108

hydrolysis of the C-terminus phenylalanine residues from the substrates by ACE2 catalysis and the

109

measurement of free amino acid phenylalanine using yeast enzyme of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) in

110

a colorimetric assay (supplementary Figure S2).

111

The reactions were carried out using indicated concentrations of ACE2-Fc proteins together with either

112

AngII or apelin-13 at indicated concentrations in reaction buffer containing 20RmM Tris-HCl, pHR=R7.4,

113

136RmM NaCl and 10RμM ZnCl2. The first reaction was proceeded at 37°C after 20 min before stopped by

114

80°C heat inactivation for 5 min. The second reaction used a phenylalanine detection kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St.

115

Louis, MO). 1 μL enzyme mix and 1RμL developer from the kit were added to the above reaction, which was

116

allowed to proceed for 20 min at room temperature. Fluorescence intensity was measured at 535Rnm

117

excitation and 585Rnm emission wavelength, and all reactions were performed in triplicate.

118

2.5. SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding assay

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.13.248351; this version posted August 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

119

Recombinant viral RBD protein was purchased from Sino Biological (Beijing, China). ELISA wells were

120

precoated with either PBS as controls or 100 ng/well of RBD protein. Serial concentrations of individual

121

ACE2-Fc variants were added to the wells. After overnight incubation at 4 , the wells were washed three

122

times with TBST buffer before HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG-Fc secondary antibody was added. HRP

123

reactions were developed with TMB substrate and the binding strength derived from OD450 (nm) readings

124

of the reactions. The EC50 values were determined by log(agonist) vs. response nonlinear regression fit

125

analysis (GraphPad Prism).

℃

126

2.6. Inhibition of viral transduction with purified ∆ACE2-Fc mutants

127

Spike (SARS-CoV-2) pseudotyped lentivirus with luciferase reporter gene was purchased from BPS

128

Bioscience (San Diego, CA). The virus was used to transduce HEK293 with stable expression of receptor full-

129

length ACE2. The stable cell line was created from plasmid expressing full-length human ACE2 in pcDNA3

130

vector. Followed a similar procedure for generating ACE2-Fc clones, stable HEK293 clones with receptor

131

ACE2 expression was identified using immune detection of ACE2 in the cells. The ACE2-HEK293 cells were

132

seeded at a density of 10,000 cells per well into white 96-well cell culture microplate one day before

133

transduction. To test inhibition of viral transduction, 5 μL pseudotyped lentivirus were preincubated with 5

134

μL vehicle or serially diluted ACE2-Fc variants at 37 °C for 1 h and then added into the cells. After overnight

135

incubation, the cells were refed with fresh medium and incubated for another 36 hours. Luciferase activity

136

was measured using ONE-Glo™ Luciferase Assay System according to the manufacture’s protocol (Promega,

137

Madison, WI). The IC50 values were determined by log(inhibitor) vs. response nonlinear regression fit

138

analysis (GraphPad Prism).

139

2.7. ACE2-Fc pharmacokinetics in mice

140

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Northwestern University approved the animal

141

procedure in this study (approved protocol number IS00009990).The general method for pharmacokinetic

142

measurements were described previously[13]. Briefly, a bolus intravenous injection of ACE2-Fc proteins

143

(0.5mg/kg body weight) was performed in 10 weeks old female BALB/c mice. Subsequently, serial blood

144

samples were collected from tail bleeding at indicated time points. Collected blood samples were left

145

undisturbed on ice, and sera were isolated by centrifugation at 6000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The levels of

146

ACE2-Fc in the sera were measured by ELISA using anti-ACE2 capturing antibody and anti-human IgG-Fc-HRP

147

antibody for detection as described above.

3. Results

149

3.1. ACE2-Fc mutagenesis strategy to remove catalytic activity

150

We constructed an ACE2-Fc template by using the ectodomain of ACE2 fused with an Fc sequence

151

(Fig1A). The chimeric fusion naturally formed a dimer of >250 kDa as expected (Fig1B). There is an extensive

152

amount of information with regard to the structural characteristics of ACE2 in relationship to SARS-CoV-2

153

receptor-binding domain (RBD)[1, 2, 36-39]. SARS-CoV-2 binds a surface segment of ACE2 through the apex

154

of its spike protein (Fig1C). ACE2 is a metallopeptidase that requires divalent cation such as zinc for activity.

155

A Zn2+ ion is buried deep in the catalytic cleft within the proximal lobe relative to the viral binding site. Based

156

on an inhibitor-bound structure of ACE2[40], both proximal and distal residues that line the catalytic cleft

157

form interactions with the inhibitor, which occupies the presumed substrate pocket (Fig1D). Zn2+ is

158

coordinated by three residues, His374, His378 and Glu402, which are the obvious choices for mutagenesis

159

when making enzymatically inactive mutants[6] (Fig1E). In addition to these Zn2+-binding sites, we sought to

160

look for catalytic residues in contact with the substrates that are further away from RBD binding segment.

161

The inhibitor-bound structure indicates six residues that extend their side chains toward the substrate

162

direction. These are Glu145, Arg273, His345, Pro346, Asp368 and His505 (Fig1F).

163

3.2. Substrate-dependent inactivation among ACE2-Fc mutants

164

Next, we made alanine-substitution of each residue including the three that bind Zn2+ and the additional

165

six that potentially bind substrates (supplementary figure S1). Wild-type and 9 mutants of ACE2-Fc were

166

produced using a HEK293 expression system as soluble proteins (Fig1B). Purified proteins were subjected to

167

a set of enzymatic assays using a surrogate Mca-APK(Dnp) fluorogenic substrate and physiological substrates

168

such as AngII and apelin-13 (Fig2). It should be noted that although the surrogate substrate Mca-APK(Dnp) is

169

traditionally used for measuring ACE2 activity, the sequence does not resemble those of the physiological

170

substrates, which share a Pro-Phe motif at their C-termini (Supplementary figure S2). Instead, the catalysis

171

of AngII and apelin-13 by ACE2-Fc variants was measured by the hydrolysis rate of their C-terminus Phe

172

amino acid[35].

173

We performed Mca-APK(Dnp) measurements, alongside phenylalanine hydrolysis assays using AngII and

174

apelin-13 as substrates to determine the enzymatic activities of the ACE2-Fc variants (Fig2A-C). In order to

175

better characterize the catalytic performances of individual ACE2-Fc mutants relative to their wild-type

176

counterpart, we conducted two types of enzymatic assays. The first method used an excess amount of the

177

enzyme (100 ng) in reactions with varying concentrations of the three substrates. This would potentially

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.13.248351; this version posted August 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

178

detect low partial activity of enzymes. The second method had a lower amount of purified ACE2-Fc variants

179

(10 ng each) to react with an excess quantity of the substrates (2 or 10 nmol: see Methods) in order to

180

distinguish among mutants with high activities. As it turned out, the results from these two methods were to

181

an extend in agreement with each other (Fig2: left panels compared to right panels). One of the surprising

182

findings was that there was a clear evidence of substrate-dependent inactivation of individual mutations,

183

particularly among those lining the inhibitor/substrate space. For instance, while Mca-APK(Dnp) showed no

184

activity of 7 ACE2-Fc mutants, including 4 substrate-binding residues of Arg273Ala, His345Ala, Pro346Ala

185

and His505Ala (Fig2A), His345Ala, Pro346Ala and His505Ala remained active toward AngII and apelin-13

186

(Fig2B,2C). In addition, His374Ala, one of the Zn2+-binding residues, retained a low level of activity against

187

Apelin-13 (Fig2C). When all three substrates are considered, Arg273Ala, His378Ala and Glu402Ala were

188

completely lack of peptidase activity. We referred these three mutants to as ∆ACE2-Fc (∆: loss-of-activity)

189

and considered them as candidate variants emerged from the screen.

190

3.3. Binding affinities of individual ACE2-Fc mutants to SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain

191

Next, we performed binding assays using individual variants against purified spike RBD protein. As

192

expected, all mutants displayed similar levels of binding to viral RBD, considering the relatively minor

193

changes from the point mutations made to ACE2-Fc (Fig3). Overall, the wild-type protein showed the highest

194

binding affinity, whereas all three Zn2+-binding site mutants, His374Ala, His378Ala and Glu402Ala, had the

195

lowest affinities to RBD. This is consistent with the expectation that the ion pocket is in proximity to the viral

196

binding site on ACE2 (Fig1C), and also that changing ion-binding can potentially induce structurally instability

197

of the protein. In contrast, Arg273Ala mutant of the substrate-binding pocket, which showed complete loss-

198

of-activity towards all three substrates, is situated on the distal lobe and is less likely to affect desired viral

199

binding.

200
201

3.4. Competitive inhibition of pseudotyped viral transduction by R273A, H378A and E402A mutants of
∆ACE2-Fc

202

∆ACE2-Fc Arg273Ala, His378Ale and Glu402Ala, and wild-type ACE2-Fc proteins were further tested for

203

their antiviral potency. We conducted a series of viral inhibition assays using a pseudotyped reporter virus

204

decorated with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The virus was able to transduce HEK293 cells that express full-

205

length receptor ACE2 (See Methods). Each of the four ACE2-Fc variants in a range of concentrations was

206

added to culture medium to test the potential of viral inhibition. As expected, all variants showed similar

207

levels of efficacy to block pseudoviral transduction (Fig4A), with wild-type ACE2-Fc had a leading IC50 of 0.13

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.13.248351; this version posted August 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

208

µg/mL, followed by His378Ala, Arg273Ala and Glu402Ala with their IC50s of 0.16 µg/mL, 0.19 µg/mL and 0.25

209

µg/mL, respectively (Fig4B).

210

3.5. Pharmacokinetics of lead ∆ACE2-Fc proteins

211

We have previously shown the in vivo longevity of mouse ACE2-Fc, as well as the fact that mouse FcRn

212

recognizes human Fc[13]. Here we intravenously injected the ACE2-Fc variants in mice and measured

213

pharmacokinetics of biologics. All three ∆ACE2-Fc and their wild-type control exhibited long half-lives in the

214

range between 52.61 hrs and 69.88 hrs (Fig5), consistent with the expectation for Fc-fusion proteins.

215

4. Discussions

216

Our study followed a design strategy of screening for ACE2-Fc variants of having an exclusive SARS-CoV-2

217

affinity with the absence of enzymatic activity towards vasoactive substrates. Based on the structure of

218

ACE2’s catalytic center, we selected a total of 9 residues to be individually replaced with alanine. These

219

included 3 residues with their side chains binding to divalent cation and 6 residues that line the substrate

220

pocket. We used a surrogate fluorogenic substrate as well as two physiological substrates of ACE2 in

221

reactions and discovered an unexpected substrate-dependent inactivation among individual mutants of

222

ACE2-Fc. The screening identified three loss-of-activity variants (∆ACE2-Fc), one with a mutation of

223

substrate-binding site and two others having impairment of cation-binding. All three lead candidates

224

maintained their binding capacity towards SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and inhibited the transduction of a

225

pseudotyped reporter virus.

226

Although we focused on inactivating ACE2 enzymatic activity to separate its actions on RAAS from SARS-

227

CoV-2 neutralization, it has been widely speculated that the dual actions may benefit treatment of COVID-

228

19. As ACE2 catalyzes the conversion of AngII to Ang-(1-7), therapeutic hrsACE2 or ACE2-Fc will change the

229

balance from AngII-mediated stimulation of AT1 receptor to AT2 and/or Mas receptor activation, which may

230

reduce pulmonary dysfunction due to AT1 associated inflammatory responses, lung edema and ARDS[15,

231

41-44]. Since there is no clinical data on ACE2-derived antiviral therapies, the hypotheses about beneficial

232

RAAS inhibition are based on observations of COVID-19 patients who are on existing ACEI or ARB

233

treatments. The general consensus is that these patients should continue RAAS blockade therapies for

234

treating comorbidities during recovering from viral infection.

235

One of the main benefits of ACE2-Fc fusion construction is its long-acting time as compared to

236

recombinant ACE2 without the tag[13]. It is expected to provide important assurance of sufficient drug

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.13.248351; this version posted August 22, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

237

levels to counteract the fluctuating levels of virions in patients, particularly during viremia. Based on clinical

238

knowledge of Fc-tagged Factor VIII (ELOCTATE®) used in hemophilia A patients, dosing at 3-5 day intervals is

239

sufficient to maintain a high blood level of the drug (US FDA recommendation).

240

The structural arrangement of ACE2-Fc resembles that of an antibody, with the replacement of antigen-

241

binding Fab portion of antibody with ACE2 to bind SARS-CoV-2 spike. Meanwhile, the Fc portion can

242

potentially induce immunological clearance of the virus, which, together in a fusion with ACE2, may be an

243

effective immunoadhesin[11, 45] to trigger complement activation, antibody-mediated cytotoxicity and

244

opsonization, and agglutination of targets. With respect to the potential antibody-like benefits of ACE2-Fc,

245

we compare our overall strategy with existing CD4 immunoadhesin (termed PRO 542) that has existing

246

clinical data for the treatment of HIV infection[46-50]. PRO 542 (CD4-IgG2/Fc with CD4 targeting HIV gp120)

247

antiviral is a tetravalent fusion protein using the constant region of IgG2 as opposed to IgG1 of ACE2-Fc. One

248

notable difference is that IgG2 has extremely low affinity to FcγRs on phagocytic cells, while both IgG1 and

249

IgG2 can activate complement. With regard to our proof-of-principle study of ACE2-Fc as candidate antiviral

250

drugs, it is important to point out that in terms of choices of the Fc tag, there are alternative strategies in

251

recombinant construction. Nevertheless, the inclusion of immunoadhesin potentials of the antiviral may

252

have caveats. While it may certainly boost immune clearance of the virus, such as through FcγR’s selective

253

binding of clustered Fc, it may also elevate complement and cytokine responses to further aggravate the

254

inflammation. Although these adverse side effects can be mitigated through modifications of the Fc domain,

255

the ultimate therapeutic effects in the context of individual patients’ conditions can only be determined

256

through rigorous clinical studies.

257

With regard to drug toxicity, our mouse study of repeated doses of ACE2-Fc in mice had showed the

258

biologic to be well tolerated for up to two months[13]. However, we cannot extrapolate that its will also be

259

safe COVID-19 patients. As we consider it is not a simple neutralizing agent of the virus, its bifurcated ACE2

260

head groups can possibly trigger agglutination of the virus that can potentially aggravate the

261

hypercoagulable state, making the drug less tolerable in these conditions.

262

From the perspective of recombinant manufacturing, there are challenges ahead for the simple fact that

263

ACE2-Fc is a large protein (~130 kDa as a monomer and ~260 kDa as a dimer). Furthermore, cocrystal

264

structures of ACE2 with an inhibitor showed large movements of the two lobes as compared to the Apo

265

structures[40], suggesting an intrinsic instability of ACE2 protein. Also of note is an earlier study by Lei et al

266

using double mutations of His374 and His378 of the zinc-binding pocket for neutralization of SARS-CoV-2[6].

267

However, the ion is important in maintaining protein structure and stability of metallopeptidases[51] [52,

268

53]. This double mutation, as well as our His378Ala and Glu402Ala single mutations of the zinc-binding

269

pocket may potentially suffer protein instability problems. On the other hand, Arg273Ala mutant that is

270

predicted to change the substrate pocket will likely have a milder impact on overall protein stability, which is

271

an important parameter in pharmaceutical production.

Figure 1. Mutagenesis strategies for catalytic inactivation of ACE2. A. Schematic representation of
chimeric ACE2-Fc. The ectodomain sequence from amino acid 19 to 740 of human ACE2 is fused to the Nterminus of Fc domain of human IgG1, which forms a dimer via disulfide bridges (blue lines). The overall plan
was to make individual point mutations (denoted as stars) of the catalytic site to inactivate the ACE2
peptidase activity. B. Mutant ACE2-Fc proteins, each carries a single alanine substitution of a selected
residue, were produced by HEK-293 cells. As predicted, the proteins ran above the 250 kDa marker under
nonreducing condition. C. The cocrystal structure (PDB: 6M0J) shows SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD binding of ACE2.
ACE2 exists in a clam shell-like configuration holding a catalytic cleft between its proximal and distal lobes. A
zinc ion resides within the proximal lobe of the cleft void. D. In an inhibitor (MLN-4760)-bound structure of
ACE2 (PBD: 1R4L), the inhibitor induced a conformational change of the catalytic cleft to adapt a ‘closed’
configuration[40]. E. Three proximal lobe residues H374, H378 and E402 formed interactions with the zinc
ion. F. The side chains of six proximal and distal lobe residues, E145, R273, H345, P346, D368 and H505 (in
green) formed direct interactions with inhibitor MLN-4760 (in magentas).

Figure 2. Substrate-dependent inactivation of ACE2-Fc peptidase among ACE2-Fc mutants. Three

peptide substrates were tested in catalytic reactions with ten individual variants of ACE2-Fc (wild-type and 9
mutants). The reactions were carried out in two different ways. Left panels: the reactions were performed
using a high amount of purified ACE2-Fc enzyme (100 ng) with varying concentrations of the substrates

between 0.39 µM and 200 µM (x-axis). Right panels: a lower dose of 10 ng ACE2-Fc was incubated with a
fixed amount of 2 nmole of Mca-APK(Dnp) or 10 nmole of AngII/Apelin-13. Reactions proceeded for a
standard length of time of 20 min. A. Surrogate fluorogenic substrate Mca-AP↓K(Dnp) was tested (↓:
cleavage site). ACE2-Fc peptidase activities were compared between wild-type and mutants. Seven out of
the nine mutants showed a completely loss-of-activity. B. When AngII was used in reactions with the ACE-2Fc panel, DRVYIHP↓F of AngII sequence was cleaved by ACE2, releasing a Phe/F. The assay detected the
generation of amino acid Phe/F as the results of ACE2-Fc activity. C. Similar to AngII, Apelin-13 was cleaved
by ACE2 between the proline(P)-phenylalanine (F) bond in its sequence, Pyr-RPRLSHKGPMP↓F. The rates of
Phe/F release from the reactions were detected. Data are shown as the mean ± SD from triplicate
experiments.

Figure 3. Binding affinities of individual ACE2-Fc variants to RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. A. A fixed
amount of recombinant viral RBD protein was coated to an ELISA plate (buffer coated well were used as
controls). Wild-type and nine mutants of ACE2-Fc were added to the wells at varying concentrations
between 0.5 ng/mL and 1200 ng/mL (x-axis). Binding was determined by the difference in signal intensity
between the RBD-coated and the corresponding control wells. B. While all variants of ACE2-Fc exhibited
affinity to viral RBD protein, there were differences in their calculated EC50 values. Data are shown as the
mean ± SD from triplicate experiments.

calculated based on calculated ACE2-Fc concentrations needed to inhibit 50% reporter activity. Data are
shown as the mean ± SD from triplicate experiments.
