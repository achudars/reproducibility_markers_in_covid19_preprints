Summary.
The COVID-19 outbreak driven by SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 2.5 million deaths globally, with the most
severe cases characterized by over-exuberant production of immune-mediators, the nature of which is not fully
understood. Interferons of the type I (IFN-I) or type III (IFN-III) families are potent antivirals, but their role in
COVID-19 remains debated. Our analysis of gene and protein expression along the respiratory tract shows that
IFNs, especially IFN-III, are over-represented in the lower airways of patients with severe COVID-19, while high
levels of IFN-III, and to a lesser extent IFN-I, characterize the upper airways of patients with high viral burden
but reduced disease risk or severity; also, IFN expression varies with abundance of the cell types that produce
them. Our data point to a dynamic process of inter- and intra-family production of IFNs in COVID-19, and suggest
that IFNs play opposing roles at distinct anatomical sites.

Introduction
Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in early 2020, the novel, severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 110 million people globally and caused
more than 2.5 million deaths. SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),
with the most severe cases characterized by the presence of enhanced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in
the bloodstream (1-4). Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of innate immune cells allow recognition of
exogenous or endogenous molecules that are produced during microbial encounter, along with activation of
antigen-specific adaptive immune responses aimed at eliminating the invading pathogen (5). Mouse models and
retrospective human studies suggest that severity and death following SARS-CoV-2 encounter is correlated with
exaggerated inflammation rather than viral load (1-4, 6-8). Consistent with this immuno-pathological etiology of
severe COVID-19 is the efficacy of corticosteroids in treating hospitalized patients (9). Nevertheless, how a
balance between the benefits (restricting viral replication and spread) and risks (inducing a cytokine storm) of
efficient immune cell activation is achieved during COVID-19 remains a mystery.
Of the many inflammatory mediators produced upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, interferons (IFNs) have
attracted much attention since the inception of the pandemic. IFNs belong to three major families: IFN-I (mainly
represented by IFN-αs and IFN-β), IFN-II (IFN-γ), and IFN-III (IFN-λ1-4) (the most recent addition) (10-12).
Upregulation of IFN-II in patients with severe COVID-19 (1, 7) is associated with increased PANoptosis, which
exacerbates pathology and death (7). In contrast, the roles of IFN-I and IFN-III during SARS-CoV-2 infection
have been a matter of debate. Indeed, IFN-I and IFN-III are among the most potent natural antivirals produced
by mammals (13, 14) and share a large part of the signaling cascade that is downstream of their receptors
(IFNAR and IFNLR, respectively). IFN-I and IFN-III also induce transcription of an overlapping pool of IFNstimulated genes (ISGs). As such, the transcriptional signature of these two types of IFNs is almost
indistinguishable (14). But given that expression of the IFNLR is restricted to just a few cell types (mainly
epithelial cells and neutrophils), IFN-III can induce an antiviral state while simultaneously limiting inflammationdriven tissue damage (14). A seminal study showed that SARS-CoV-2, compared to other viruses, boosts the
production of inflammatory mediators, while dampening the induction of ISGs and viral control in COVID-19
patients (15). Subsequent studies have confirmed that levels of IFN-I are highly impaired in the peripheral blood
of patients with severe COVID-19 (16); also that such patients exhibit a profound suppression of IFN signaling

(17) and a diminished and delayed production of IFN-III and IFN-I (18) compared to flu-infected patients.
Nevertheless, regulation of IFN-I and IFN-III production following infection with SARS-CoV-2 appears to be more
complicated. In fact, analysis of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) derived from the lower airways of
COVID-19 patients has revealed a heightened immune response and increased ISG production (19). ISGs are
also potently induced in peripheral blood monocytes of patients with severe COVID-19 (2), and production of
IFNs is prolonged in the blood of a longitudinal cohort of COVID-19 patients (1). These discrepancies may, in
part, be explained by the complexity and diversity of the patient cohorts, by the fact that ISGs rather than IFNs
were measured, and by the heterogeneity of samples analyzed (e.g.: BALF vs. plasma).
Aside from the challenge of understanding if, when, and where IFNs are produced in patients infected
with SARS-CoV-2, a major unanswered question is whether IFNs serve a protective or a detrimental function in
COVID-19. Recent studies show that up to 15% of patients with severe COVID-19 have inborn errors of IFN-I
immunity and autoantibodies against IFN-I (20, 21). Also, lack of an IFN signature is associated with a poor
prognosis (22). These data strongly suggest that an efficient IFN response is essential for protecting against the
development of a severe pathology. Other studies, however, report that dysregulated and prolonged production
of IFNs in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is correlated with negative clinical outcomes (1, 2). We have also
recently demonstrated that, after prolonged exposure to a respiratory virus or to viral ligands, the production of
IFN-III, and to a lesser extent of IFN-I, impairs lung function and may trigger a severe pathology (23, 24). Thus,
it is urgent to fully unravel the role of IFNs in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.
To define how IFN production varies at different anatomical sites during the progression of COVID-19,
here we have analyzed a cohort of more than 250 subjects, including: i) SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with
different clinical severity; ii) individuals with ARDS that was not driven by SARS-CoV-2 (either diagnosed with
H1N1 influenza A virus or not); iii) patients with non-infectious lung pathologies; and iv) healthy controls. We
analyzed the pattern and level of expression of IFNs and of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the upper or lower
respiratory tract. Our data demonstrate that specific members amongst and between IFN families are
differentially regulated, based on the location along the respiratory tract, the age of the patient, the severity of
the pathology, and the viral load. Patients that were severely infected with SARS-CoV-2 displayed a unique
inflammatory signature in the lung compared to that in the blood, or to the one found in patients with other types
of ARDS. Finally, the production of specific members of the type I and type III IFN families was related to either

immune cells or epithelial cells, and to the unique ability of specific PRRs to induce IFN expression in these cell
types.

Results.
Members of the IFN-III and IFN-I families are over-represented in the lower airways of COVID-19 patients.
To determine whether IFNs are produced during COVID-19, we studied 152 nasopharyngeal swabs from
SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects, including 29 patients with a known clinical follow-up (Table 1). In particular, 18
cases required hospitalization, 2 patients needed intensive care unit (ICU) admission, whereas 9 mild cases only
required home quarantine. Twenty SARS-CoV-2 negative swabs were included as controls. In the study we also
included BALF samples coming from 21 severe hospitalized patients, including 17 ICU-admitted subjects (Table
1). Sex and age were distributed among the three groups as reported in Table 1 and Supplementary Figure
1A-C.
Gene expression for the 4 members of the IFN-III family, as well as for selected members of the IFN-I
family, was analyzed by quantitative real-time (RT)-PCR in the upper (swabs) and lower (BALF) airways.
Transcripts of IFN-III members (with the exception of IFN-λ1) and IFN-I were significantly upregulated in the
lower airways compared to the upper airways of patients who tested positive or negative for SARS-CoV-2
(Figure 1A-F). Comparison of the production of IFNs in the upper airways of individuals who were SARS-CoV2 positive versus negative revealed that several IFN members were also significantly upregulated in COVID-19
patients (Figure 1A-F). In contrast, no difference was observed in expression of the mRNA for the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 between the three groups (Figure 1G-H).
We observed that gene expression levels of all tested cytokines had a strong bimodal distribution
because a fraction of samples had undetectable levels of transcript. We, thus, transformed the gene expression
data in categorical variables (expressed or undetected) and evaluated the likelihood of each transcript to be
expressed in the BALF as compared to nasopharyngeal swabs (Supplementary Figure 1D-K). We found that
IFN-λ2,3, IFN-λ4 and IFN-α4 were expressed in a significantly larger proportion of BALF samples compared to
SARS-CoV-2 positive swabs (Supplementary Figure 1E, F, I). Conversely, transcript of the pro-inflammatory
cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 was detected in a significantly larger proportion of nasopharyngeal swabs samples
compared to the BALF (Supplementary Figure 1J-K). These data demonstrate that selected members of both

IFN-III and IFN-I families are over-represented in the lower airways of severe cases of COVID-19, compared to
the upper airways of individuals who were infected less severely, or not at all, with SARS-CoV-2.

A unique IFN signature characterizes the lower airways of COVID-19 patients compared to patients with
other ARDS or non-infectious lung pathologies.
Figure 1 shows that the lower airways of severe COVID-19 patients are characterized by the expression
of transcripts of several members of the IFN-III and IFN-I families. However, whether the relative distribution of
the IFN members, as measured by qPCR, correlates with their protein levels remains unknown. We thus used a
multiplex approach to gain insight into the protein levels of IFNs and other inflammatory cytokines in the BALF
of subjects infected with COVID-19. We selected an additional 30 patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19
requiring intubation and BALF sampling. The protein signature of these samples was compared to the BALFs of
patients with ARDS not driven by SARS-CoV-2 (9, 5 of which were diagnosed with H1N1 influenza A virus
infection), and 30 patients with non-infectious lung involvement including fibrosis (10), sarcoidosis (10) or lung
transplant (10) (going forward, these will be referred to as “controls”). Table 2 lists the details of this second
cohort of patients. The levels of IFN-III an IFN-I measured in patients with COVID-19 were elevated (Figure 2AD), in agreement with results of the transcriptional analyses (Figure 1). IFN-λ2,3 and IFN-α2 were significantly
upregulated in COVID-19 patients relative to controls, as well as when compared to patients with ARDS of
different etiologies, while the production of IFNλ-1 and IFN-β was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients
compared to controls, but not to other ARDS patients (Figure 2A-D). Overall, IFN-III were more represented
than IFN-I (Supplementary Figure 2A). Finally, our results show no correlation between age and IFN levels,
nor between age and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Supplementary Figure 2B-H).
Given the recent focus on measuring IFNs or ISGs either in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients,
or on their local production the lungs (1, 2, 7, 15-23), we compared levels of specific members of IFN-III and IFNI in the BALF and in the plasma of a subset of COVID-19 patients (Table 2). We found no correlation between
these levels for any of the IFN members studied (Figure 2E-H). As with IFN-I and IFN-III, levels of IFN-II and
pro-inflammatory cytokines also did not show any correlation between levels found in the BALF and the plasma
(Figure 2I, J, Supplementary Figure 2I).

We then compared the production in the BALF not only of IFN-III and IFN-I proteins, but also of IFN-II
and other proteins associated with the inflammatory process (Figure 2K and Table 3); we found that COVID-19
patients are characterized by a unique signature of IFNs (which encompasses all three IFN families) and IL-10
production. Many proinflammatory cytokines whose gene induction depends on NF-KB activation are also
upregulated in patients who have ARDS that is not driven by SARS-CoV-2; most of these patients also express
IFN-λ1, but not other members of the IFN families.
Overall, these data demonstrate that COVID-19 patients are characterized by a unique IFN signature in
the lower airways relative to patients with ARDS of different etiology, and that IFN-III are the most abundant of
all the IFNs in COVID-19 patients.

High viral loads drive the efficient production of IFN-III, and to a lesser extent of IFN-I, in an agedependent manner in the upper airways of COVID-19 patients.
Our data above (Figure 1 and Figure 2) document the efficient production of IFNs in the lower airways
of patients with severe COVID-19. IFNs in general, and IFN-III in particular, are also known to play protective
roles in the upper airways during viral infections (25-27). Because approximately 15% of severe COVID-19 cases
display defects in IFN responses (20, 21), we hypothesized that the increased production of IFNs in the lower
airways contributes to the cytokine storm, and facilitates detrimental responses (23, 24); also that IFN production
in the upper airways serves a protective function to prevent the spread of virus into the lower airways and severe
disease.
To test this hypothesis, we analyzed gene expression in nasopharyngeal swabs derived from our cohort
of 152 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (Swab+) (Table 1) to determine how the pattern of expression of IFNs
correlates with viral load, patients’ age, and disease severity. Initially, we examined the distribution of IFN-III and
IFN-I levels relative to the viral load, inferred by the mean cycle threshold (Ct) of RT-PCR amplification of the
ORF1a/b and E gene regions of SARS-CoV-2 (see Methods for detailed description of viral load definition). We
found that expression of several IFNs was correlated with viral levels (Figure 3A-F). This is in agreement with
another study that reported on ISG levels as a function of viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs (28). Of the IFNIII family members, IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2,3 were positively correlated with viral load. Amongst IFN-I, IFN-β and
IFN-α4 also showed a positive correlation with the viral load while IFN-α2 did not show a significant correlation.

Transcript levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL1B and IL6 were also positively correlated to the viral load
(Figure 3G, H).
We next evaluated how gene expression relates to the age of patients. Several studies have shown that
the severity and lethality of COVID-19 increase with age, with a sharp upturn starting in the eighth decade (29,
30). In particular, elderly patients display prolonged and dysregulated production of IFN-I, II and III in the plasma
(1). We thus divided our cohort of patients into those that were greater than or less than 70 years of age (indicated
as “≥70”, and “<70”, respectively). Our analyses confirmed that IFN-λ1 expression is tightly associated with the
viral load and is independent of patients’ age (Figure 3I). In contrast, expression of IFN-λ2,3 and IFN-λ4
maintained the association with the viral load only for the < 70 cohort (Figure 3J, K). Also, IFN-I showed an
association with the viral load in the <70, but not ≥70, patient cohort (Figure 3L-N), while both pro-inflammatory
cytokines maintained their association with the viral load independent of age (Figure 3O, P).
Next, we divided our patient cohort into terciles based on the viral load (Table 4), and analyzed gene
expression. Results confirmed that at the highest viral load, IFN-λ2,3 and IFN-β are significantly upregulated in
the <70, compared to the ≥70, cohort (Supplementary Figure 3A-F). Notably, while no difference was observed
between age groups for IL-6, elder patients (≥70) showed significant increase in IL1B levels compared to younger
ones at low viral loads (Supplementary Figure 3G, H). These findings confirm, also at the local level, the
complex picture of the inflammatory signatures that have been reported for blood of COVID-19 patients (1) and
further support the importance of IL-1β in driving detrimental immune responses during lung viral infections (31).
To account for the bimodal distribution of cytokine gene expression data we transformed it in discrete
variables (expressed or undetected). Using logistic regression, we estimated the odds ratio for genes to be
expressed in medium (“++”) and high viral (“+++”) load samples compared to low viral load (“+”) and tested if
there was an interaction between viral load and age groups on gene expression. We found that response patterns
to viral load were significantly different between elder (≥70) and younger (<70) patients for IFN-λ2,3 (P value for
interaction<0.001) and IFN-α4 (P value for interaction=0.03). This analysis also showed that only younger
patients have a dose-response relationship between IFN gene expression and viral load (Supplementary
Figure 3I-M and Table 5), further confirming a dysregulated production of IFNs in the elderly (≥70) group, not
only at the systemic (1), but also at the local level. In contrast to IFNs, no difference in the dose-response

relationship between IL-1β and IL-6 expression and viral load was observed between age groups
(Supplementary Figure 3N, O, G, H and Table 5).

Mild COVID-19 is characterized by high levels of IFN-III, not IFN-I, in response to high viral loads in the
upper airways.
The data in Figure 3 suggest that younger patients, associated with lower risk to develop severe COVID19, present higher levels of IFNs when the viral load is high. To explore a possible link between IFN production
and disease severity, we repeated our analyses in our subset of patients with a known clinical follow-up. Disease
severity was assessed as follows: hospitalized patients (HOSP) that were further grouped between those
admitted to the ICU (HOSP ICU) and not (HOSP non ICU), and patients that have been discharged from the
emergency room without being hospitalized that were identified as home-isolated (HI) (Table 6). When IFN-III
levels were plotted against the viral load, only the less severe, home isolated patients showed a positive
correlation with IFN-λ2,3 expression, while the viral load correlated with IFN-λ1 in both groups (Figure 4A-C);
this correlation was lost for IFN-I (Figure 4D-F). With regard to pro-inflammatory cytokines, the positive
correlation between IL6 levels and viral load was maintained only for hospitalized patients, while we could not
observe positive correlation between viral load and IL1B expression in either of the patient groups (Figure 4G,
H).
We then divided these samples into 3 clusters via unbiased K-mean clustering, based on their expression
of IFN-I, IFN-III and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Our results reveal that cluster 3, characterized by high
expression of IFN-III (IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2,3), and to a lesser extent of IFN-I, was enriched in home-isolated patients
with milder disease manifestations and high viral load (Figure 4I-K, Supplementary Figure 4A-C). In contrast,
cluster 2 (low levels of IFN-III and the highest levels of IFN-I) and cluster 1 (low IFN-I and IFN-III expression and
high IL-1β expression) were enriched in the most severe patients (Figure 4I-K, Supplementary Figure 4A).
Moreover, patients in cluster 2 were 10 times more likely to have severe illness resulting in hospitalization or ICU
admission than patients in cluster 3 (Figure 4L, odds ratio 10.1, 95% confidence interval 1.0-97.5, P value
<0.05). Overall, these data support the hypothesis that efficient production of IFN-III in the upper airways of
COVID-19 patients with high viral load protects against severe COVID-19.

Bronchial epithelial cells and phagocytes produce specific members of the IFN-III and IFN-I family when
activated by different PRRs.
A general consensus in the field is that tropism of SARS-CoV-2 favors the infection of ACE2-positive
epithelial cells along the respiratory tract (32-35), while immune cells respond during COVID-19 to either viral
components or to host molecules released during the infection process (33, 35-37). Recently, activation of the
retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)/ melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5) pathway in
epithelial cells has been implicated as a major driver of IFN production in response to SARS-CoV-2 (38). Based
on our data, we hypothesized that different populations of cells contribute to IFN production during a viral
infection by activating specific PRRs. We also found that, while the mRNA for IFNL1 is absent in the lower
airways of COVID-19 patients (Figure 1A), protein levels for IFN-λ1 are abundant at the same anatomical site
(Supplementary Figure 2A). These data suggest that cells that actively produce the mRNA for IFNL1 are
underrepresented in the BALF. However, IFNL1 is one of the most upregulated genes in the upper airways.
Given that epithelial cells are over-represented in swabs from upper epithelial airways (35), but are underrepresented in the BALF (39, 40), we next explored how PRR activation of epithelial cells, or of phagocytes,
differentially drives IFN production (Figure 5A).
Our data confirmed that of the PRRs targeted to activate epithelial cells, the RIG-I pathway, and to a
lesser extent TLR3, were the most potent inducers of IFNs, and in particular of IFN-λ1, IFN-λ2,3 and IFN-β, at
the mRNA level in epithelial cells (Supplementary Figure 5A, Table 7A). Also, epithelial cells showed a
preferential production of IFNs, and consequently of ISGs, relative to other pro-inflammatory mediators
(Supplementary Figure 5A, Table 7A). A comparison of the protein levels for the different IFNs produced by
epithelial cells revealed that TLR3 and RIG-I stimulation led to an efficient production of both IFN-III and IFN-I
(Figure 5B, Supplementary Figure 5C, Table 7B), and to a lesser extent of inflammatory cytokines
(Supplementary Figure 5B, Table 7B). Notably, epithelial cells are more potent producers of IFN-λ1 compared
to IFN-λ2,3 upon stimulation of TLR3, RIG-I and MDA-5 pathways with Poly (I:C), 3p-hpRNA and transfected
Poly (I:C) respectively (Figure 5B, Supplementary Figure 5C).
We next evaluated the response to viral PAMPs on phagocytes, which are overrepresented in the BALF.
In particular, we activated bacterial or viral sensors in bulk peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), or in
monocytes or conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) isolated form PBMCs. Monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) were

used as a comparison. Regarding the production of IFNs, each cell population was found to respond differentially
to PRR stimulation: while PBMCs were particularly able to produce IFN-II in response to viral and bacterial
ligands, cDCs were uniquely capable of producing very high levels of IFN-λ2,3, and to a lesser extent of IFN-λ1,
solely in response to TLR3 stimulation (Figure 5C-F, Table 8). This is in agreement with our previous data,
which show that in the mouse system, cDCs are the major producers of IFN-III in response to activation of the
TLR3/TRIF pathway (23). When these analyses were extended to NF-kB-dependent (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8)
as well as to type II cytokine (IL-10, GM-CSF), and chemokine (CXCL10) production, each cell type revealed a
unique pattern of protein production (Supplementary Figure 5D-G, Table 8), underscoring the complexity and
cell-specificity of the inflammatory response.
Collectively, these data demonstrate that epithelial cells preferentially produce IFN-λ1 upon RIG-I/MDA-5 or
TLR3 stimulation, while TLR3 is the major driver of IFN-III production by cDCs. They also show that specific
members of the IFN-I and IFN-III classes are differentially produced upon stimulation of PRRs on immune and
epithelial cells.

Discussion.
COVID-19 has caused more than 2.5 million deaths globally, and has had devastating societal and
economic effects. Notwithstanding the rising expectations linked to the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines, a better
understanding of the molecular underpinnings that drive the severe pathology in patients infected with the SARSCoV-2 virus is imperative in order to implement effective additional prophylactic and/or therapeutic interventions.
IFN-I and IFN-III are potent anti-viral cytokines and, among available therapeutic options, the potential of using
clinical grade recombinant IFN-I or IFN-III as therapeutics has raised much hope and interest (41). However, a
more complete understanding of how IFNs affect the development of COVID-19 is an essential first step for
designing such IFN-related therapeutic interventions. To date, though, opposing evidence has complicated our
view of the role played by members of the IFN-I and IFN-III families during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we
present analyses of respiratory samples of a cohort of over 200 SARS-CoV-2 patients with different clinical
manifestations of COVID-19. Similar analyses were also performed on respiratory samples from patients with
non-SARS-CoV-2 ARDS, as well as with other non-infectious clinical conditions. We scrutinized gene and protein
expression along the respiratory tract in these individuals and found higher levels of IFNs in the lower airways of
individuals with severe COVID-19 compared to other ARDS patients. In particular, IFN-III production was most
exuberant in the severely ill patients. Of note, we found no correlation between cytokine levels in the lungs and
in the plasma. In contrast to the lower airways, an efficient production of IFN-III, and to a lesser extent of IFN-I,
was detected in the upper airways of patients with a high viral load but lower risk of developing severe COVID19. In particular, individuals younger than 70 years of age, who are known to be less susceptible to severe
COVID-19 and COVID-19-related death, showed a stronger correlation between IFN levels and viral load. In
keeping with a protective effect of the IFNs in the upper airways, we found that patients with mild manifestations
exhibited elevated levels of IFN-III at high viral loads, while hospitalized patients didn’t show this correlation. And
finally, we observed that different cell types produce either IFN-I or IFN-III in response to specific microbial
ligands. Together, these data suggest that the variability in levels of specific members of the IFN families along
the respiratory tract, and also among different groups of patients, may be at least partially explained by the cell
types that are enriched and/or activated under the various conditions. Our results establish that the differences
in the production of inter and intra-family IFN members are caused by a dynamic process that varies based on
the localization of the response, and suggest that the IFNs play opposing roles at distinct anatomical sites, either

preventing or facilitating the severity of COVID-19. These findings will be fundamental for designing appropriate
pharmacological interventions to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 or for dampening the severity of COVID19.
We and others have recently demonstrated that IFN-IIIs, long believed to be initiators of anti-viral
responses at mucosal surfaces that are less detrimental than those induced by type I IFNs (14), also profoundly
alter lung barrier function during a viral infection (23, 24). Our recent report describes that SARS-CoV-2 induced
production of IFNs in the lower airways of a small cohort of 10 patients with COVID-19 and 5 healthy controls.
Here, we have extended this analysis, and partially revised our conclusions, by showing not only that severely
affected COVID-19 patients are characterized by the highest levels of IFNs (at the mRNA as well as protein
levels), but also that high levels of SARS-CoV-2 induce the efficient production of IFN-III in the upper airways.
Moreover, IFN production is increased in the upper airways of younger patients, and is associated with milder
disease manifestations. These data support the hypothesis that IFNs have opposing roles along the respiratory
tract, and reconcile some of the seemingly contradictory findings on IFNs in COVID-19 patients. Efficient initiation
of IFN production in the upper airways (in younger and mildly infected patients) can lead to a more rapid
elimination of the virus and may limit viral spread to the lower airways. The report that 15% of severe COVID-19
patients are characterized by defects in IFN signaling strongly supports the hypothesis that the early production
of IFNs in the upper airways protects against SARS-CoV-2, and that in the absence of such production, SARSCoV-2 may spread to the lower respiratory tract and cause a more severe illness. On the other hand, when the
virus escapes immune control in the upper airways, the IFN production that is potently boosted in the lungs likely
contributes to the cytokine storm and associated tissue damage that is typical of severe COVID-19. We also
found that IFN-γ, which reportedly aggravates the severity of COVID-19 independently of viral the load, is
elevated in the BALF of severe patients. However, since none of the IFNs tested in this study showed a positive
correlation between local production in lung cells and systemic levels in the plasma, inferring the inflammatory
landscape in the lungs based on plasma measurements remains a challenge.
Another novel finding in the present study is that the type of IFN produced in response to different PRR
pathways varies according to cell type. This may explain the varying pattern of the expression of IFNs along the
respiratory tract. Epithelial cells of the upper and lower respiratory tracts express viral entry receptors, which
facilitate the entrance and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in these cells (32-35). Although the capacity of these cells

to recognize and respond to viral components is confounded by the presence of SARS-CoV-2 effector proteins
(which block immune recognition and IFN production) (42-45), our finding that the high viral load in the upper
airways induces a potent immune response is compatible with reports from other groups that show IFN induction
in epithelial cells upon SARS-CoV-2 infection (28). Note that viral loads in our cohort were not correlated with
disease severity, supporting the view that a high viral load in the upper airways favors the production of IFNs,
which in turn serve a protective role. This is in keeping with the recent observation that epithelial cell-intrinsic
IFN-dependent responses limit viral spread, and that SARS-CoV-2 induces a more severe pathology in the
absence of such responses (35). Moreover, there is a growing consensus that a high viral load in the respiratory
tract is not per se a prognostic marker of clinical severity (46, 47). High viral loads in the upper airways may
therefore be associated to a protective immune response in young individuals, whilst eliciting a dysregulated
inflammatory response in older patients, as observed in our study.
Our findings shed new light on the nature of the IFNs and on the molecular pathways that drive intrinsic
immunity. In particular, we have shown that IFN-III are highly represented in the upper airways of younger and/or
less severely infected patients, and that epithelial cells preferentially produce this type of IFN. Although additional
studies are needed to directly link specific IFNs to particular cell types, our data support the possibility that
efficient activation of epithelial cells in the upper airways, and induction of the potent IFN-III response, protect
against severe COVID-19.
In agreement with our previous findings (23), we show that, cDCs are major producers of IFN-III, and
especially of IFN-λ2,3. These IFNs are characteristically expressed along the lower airways of severe COVID19 patients. Epithelial cells can be directly infected by SARS-CoV-2, but phagocytes are believed to host only
abortive infections (33, 35, 36). Most immune cells respond to SARS-CoV-2 upon recognizing either the virus or
host-derived molecules (40). Indeed, we found that IFN-III production by phagocytes is driven by the TLR3
pathway, in humans as well as in mice. TLR3 recognizes double-stranded intermediates of SARS-CoV-2
replication that may be released by bystander-infected cells (48). Thus, while phagocyte-derived IFN-λ2,3 may
contribute to raise IFN-III levels produced by epithelial cells, it may also drive the detrimental effects of IFN-III in
the lower airways. Indeed, the lower airways are where extensive cell death during severe COVID-19 can initiate
a negative feed-back loop that favors tissue damage, along with the release of viral intermediates and host
inflammatory ligands that further exacerbate IFN production.

Finally, our findings highlight the importance of the timing of production and/or administration of IFNs
during COVID-19. It has been proposed (49) and experimentally proven (45, 50, 51) that early administration of
IFNs may prevent infection and/or favor SARS-CoV-2 clearance, consistent with previous mouse studies on
highly pathogenic human coronaviruses (52). A retrospective study on the use of recombinant (r)IFN-I
corroborates these findings (53). Yet the results of clinical trials that employed clinical grade human rIFN-λ were
inconclusive: early administration of IFN-III in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, ranging between mild and
asymptomatic manifestations, did not shorten the time of hospitalization (54). In contrast, another study
documented that if IFN-IIIs are dispensed early after symptom onset or to asymptomatic patients, this induces a
faster decline in viral load and faster remission in patients with an elevated viral load (55). Our data are in
agreement with the idea that early administration (before infection or early after symptom onset) of exogenous
IFN-IIIs may be an effective therapeutic intervention, and that targeting the upper airways, while avoiding
systemic administration as previously proposed (49), represents the best way to exploit the anti-viral activities of
IFNs.
In conclusion, our data define the anatomical map of inter and intra-family production of IFNs, and
highlight how IFN production is linked to the different outcomes of COVID-19, based on the location of the IFN
response. Our findings reconcile a large portion of the literature on IFNs, and further stress the key role played
by IFN-III, compared to IFN-I, at mucosal surfaces during life-threatening viral infections.

FIGURE 4. Mild COVID-19 is characterized by high levels of IFN-III, not IFN-I, in response to high viral
loads in the upper airways (A-L) Swabs from a cohort of SARS-CoV-2+ patients with known disease severity
including ICU inpatients and hospitalized patients (HOSP, black dots and lines) and home-isolated patients (HI,
red dots and lines) were analyzed. (A-H) IFNL1 (A), IFNL2,3 (B), IFNL4 (C), IFNB1 (D), IFNA2 (E), IFNA4 (F),
IL1B (G), and IL6 (H) mRNA expression is plotted against mean viral RNA CT. Expression is plotted as log2
(gene/GAPDH mRNA + 0.5 x gene-specific minimum). Each dot represents a patient. Linear regression lines
(continuous line) and 95% confidence interval (dashed line and shaded area) are depicted. Spearman correlation
coefficients (r) and p-value (p) are indicated in black and in red for HOSP and HI patients respectively. (I) Kmeans clustering based on the expression of IFNA2, IFNB1 IFNL1, IFNL2,3, IL1B was used to determine clusters
1-3 (Cluster 1 n=15, Cluster 2 n=8, Cluster 3 n=6). The color indicates the relative gene expression. Viral load
tercile, age group and severity are annotated. Viral load terciles (“+++”, “++”, “+”) are defined by mean viral RNA
CT (<20, >20 and <30, > 30). Age groups are defined as <70 or ≥70-year old patients. Severity groups are
defined as follows: HI=home isolated, HOSP (non ICU)=Hospitalized patients that did not require ICU admission,
HOSP (ICU)=Hospitalized patients admitted to the ICU. (J) IFNL1, IFNL2,3, IFNA2, IFNB1, IL1B mRNA
expression within clusters identified in Figure 4I. Expression is plotted as log2 (gene/GAPDH mRNA + 0.5 x
gene-specific minimum). Each dot represents a patient. Violin plots are depicted. (K) Percentage of patients with
the indicated disease severity within clusters identified in Figure 4I. (L) Odds ratio of patients in Cluster 2 and
Cluster 1 being hospitalized relative to patients in Cluster 3 (Clusters identified in Figure 4I). Symbols represent
the odds ratio. Error bars represent the 95% confidence interval associated to the odds ratio. Statistics: (L) Odds

Materials and Methods.
Reagents and antibodies
For in vitro studies, we used LPS (ALX-581-013-L002) from ENZO, Poly (I:C) HMW (tlr-pic), R848 (tlr-r848),
CpG(C) (tlrl-2395), 2’3’cGAMP (tlrl-nacga23-02) and 3p-hpRNA/LyoVec (tlrl-hprnalv) purchased from Invivogen.
Lipofectamine 3000 Transfection Reagent (L3000-008) was purchased from Invitrogen. Phagocytes were
cultured in RPMI 1640 medium + GlutaMAX (72400-047) with 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (15140122) purchased
from Thermo Fisher, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). HBECs were cultured as previously described (Major
et al., 2020). For flow cytometry we used PerCP/Cy5.5 CD14 (clone HCD14), APC/Cyanine7 HLA-DR (clone
L243), PE/Cy7 CD11c (clone 3.9) and PE CD141 (clone M80) antibodies purchased from Biolegend.

Clinical samples for gene expression analysis
Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected using FLOQSwabs® (COPAN) in UTM® Universal Transport Medium
(COPAN) from 152 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and from 20 negative subjects undergoing screening for
suspected social contacts with SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at San
Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) from April to December 2020. BALF was obtained from severe SARS-CoV-2positive patients hospitalized at San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) from March to May 2020. See Table 1, Table
4, Table 5 for patient information. All samples were stored at −80°C until processing. 500 μl of each BALF and
swab sample were lysed and used for RNA extraction (see RNA extraction protocol and Real-Time PCR for
clinical samples and HBECs).
Data were obtained from the COVID-BioB clinical database of the IRCCS San Raffaele Hospital. The study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of San Raffaele Hospital (protocol No. 34/int/2020) and was registered on
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04318366). All patients signed an informed consent form. Our research was in
compliance to the Declaration of Helsinki.

Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA amount in clinical samples
The viral load was inferred on nasopharyngeal swabs through cycle threshold (Ct) determination with Cobas®
SARS-CoV-2 Test (Roche), a real-time PCR dual assay targeting ORF-1a/b and E-gene regions on SARS-CoV2 genome. The mean between ORF-1a/b and E Ct was used as an indirect measure of the viral load. Non-

infectious plasmid DNA containing a specific SARS-CoV-2 sequence and a pan-Sarbecovirus sequence are
used in the test as positive control. A non-Sarbecovirus related RNA construct is used as internal control. The
test is designed to be performed on the automated Cobas® 6800 Systems under Emergency Use Authorization
(EUA). The test is available as a CE-IVD test for countries accepting the CE-mark.

Clinical samples for cytokine quantification in BALF and plasma
BALF from 30 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) at Luigi Sacco Hospital
(Milan, Italy) were collected from September to November 2020. Blood from 17 of these patients was also
collected on the same day. BALF from patients affected by ARDS (9 in total, 5 of which were diagnosed H1N1
influenza A virus) were collected from February 2014 to March 2018. Samples from: lung fibrosis patients (10)
were collected from May 2018 to September 2020; sarcoidosis patients (10) were collected from August to July
2020; lung transplant patients (10) were collected from January 2018 to September 2020 by IRCCS Policlinico
San Matteo Foundation (Pavia, Italy). None of the patients affected by lung fibrosis, sarcoidosis or that received
lung transplant was diagnosed a respiratory viral or bacterial infection. See Table 2 for patient information. BALF
specimens from COVID-19 patients were managed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory until viral inactivation with a
0.2% SDS and 0.1% Tween-20 solution and heating at 65 °C for 15 min. Cell-free BALF supernatants were
stored at − 20 °C until analysis. Blood was centrifuged at 400g for 10 minutes without brake and plasma was
stored at − 20 °C until analysis. Samples were processed with LEGENDplexTM (740390, BioLegend) according
to manufacturer’s instructions and read by flow cytometry.
Research and data collection protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Boards (Comitato Etico di
Area 1) (prot. 20100005334) and by IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation Hospital (prot. 20200046007).
All patients signed an informed consent form. Our research was in compliance to the Declaration of Helsinki.

Culture of primary HBECs and in vitro stimulation
Primary human bronchial epithelial cells were purchased from Lonza and cultured as per manufacturer’s
instructions. In brief, cells were expanded in a T-75 flask to 60% confluence and then trypsinized and seeded
(3x104 cells/transwell) onto 0.4 μm pore size clear polyester membranes (Greiner) coated with a collagen
solution. Cells were grown in submersion until confluent, and then exposed to air to establish an air-liquid

interface (ALI). At ALI day 15, cells were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml), R848 (10 μg/ml), CpG(C) (1 μM), Poly
(I:C) (50 μg/ml), Poly (I:C) (1 μg/106 cells) + Lipofectamine, 3p-hpRNA/LyoVec (100 ng/ml), and cGAMP (10 μg
/ml). Supernatants and cell lysates were collected 24 hours post treatment. Supernatants were processed with
LEGENDplexTM (740390, BioLegend) according to manufacturer’s instructions and read by flow cytometry.
Lysates were processed for RNA extraction as described below.

Isolation of human phagocytes and in vitro stimulation
Human phagocytes were isolated from collars of blood received from Boston Children’s Hospital blood donor
center. Briefly, blood was diluted 1:2 in PBS and PBMCs were isolated using a Histopaque (1077-1, Sigma)
gradient. Monocytes were positively selected from PBMCs with CD14 MicroBeads (130-050-201, Miltenyi Biotec)
by MACS technology. MoDCs were differentiated from monocytes in the presence of GM-CSF 20ng/ml
(PeproTech, 300-03) and IL-4 20ng/ml (PeproTech 200-04) for 7 days. MoDCs differentiation was tested for
CD14 downregulation and HLA-DR expression (Figure Supplementary 6A, B). cDCs were positively selected
from PBMCs with CD141 (BDCA-3) MicroBead Kit (130-090-512, Miltenyi Biotec) by MACS technology (Figure
Supplementary 6C). Cells were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml), R848 (10 μg/ml), CpG(C) (1 μM), Poly (I:C)
(50 μg/ml), 3p-hpRNA/LyoVec (2.5 μg/ml), and cGAMP (10 μg/ml). Supernatants were collected 24 hours post
treatment and stored at − 20 °C until analysis. Supernatants were processed with LEGENDplexTM (740390,
BioLegend) according to manufacturer’s instructions and read by flow cytometry.

RNA extraction protocol and Real-Time PCR from clinical samples and HBECs
RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs, BALFs and HBECs culture lysates using Pure Link RNA Micro
Scale kit (12183016, Thermo Fisher) according to manufacturer’s instruction, including in-column DNase
treatment. Reverse transcription was performed using SuperScriptTM III First-Strand Synthesis System
(18080051, Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instruction. qRT-PCR analysis was then carried out with
TaqmanTM Fast Advanced Master Mix (4444963) by using specific TaqmanTM Gene Expression Assays from
Thermo Fisher. IFNL1 (Hs01050642_gH), IFNL2,3 (Hs04193047_gH), IFNL4 (Hs04400217_g1), IFNB1

(Hs99999905_m1). All transcripts were tested in triplicate for each sample on ViiA7 Real-Time PCR System
(Thermo Fisher) for clinical samples and on Quantastudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher) for HBECs.

Statistical Analyses
One-way ANOVA with Turkey’s post-hoc test was used to compare continuous variables among multiple groups.
Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post-hoc test or Multiple Mann-Whitney tests with Holm-Šídák method were used
instead when data did not meet the normality assumption. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare categorical
variables. Spearman correlation analysis was used to examine the degree of association between two
continuous variables. To establish the appropriate test, normal distribution and variance similarity were assessed
with the D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus normality test.
Cluster analysis with unbiased K-mean methods based on the expression of IFN-I, IFN-III and the
proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β were used to classify a subset of COVID-19 patients into 3 exclusive clusters.
Heatmaps and K-mean clustering were generated in R and visualized with the ComplexHeatmap package.
Clustering analysis was performed using Euclidean distances. Estimated (K) value was selected based on the
elbow point cluster number. Logistic regression models were performed to estimate the association of gene
expression as binary outcome within viral load terciles (defined by mean viral RNA CT <20, >20 and <30, > 30),
and clusters (cluster 1, cluster 2 and cluster 3). Interaction between viral load terciles and age groups (≥70 years
vs <70 years) were tested to detect significant difference between elder patients and young patients in their gene
expression response to different levels of viral load. All statistical analyses were two-sided and performed using
Prism9 (Graphpad) software or SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute).

IFNL2,3, IFNL1, IFNB1, IFNA2, CCL5, OASL1, IL6, TNF and IL1B mRNA expression 24 hours after treatment. The
color is proportional to Log2 (Fold Change) of each gene. Rows in each group represent biological replicates distributed
as indicated in the legend. (B) Heatmap representation of IL-8, CXCL10, IL-6 and IL-1β production 24 hours after
stimulation. The color is proportional to the Log10 transformed concentration (pg/ml) of each cytokine. Rows in each
group represent a biological replicate. (C) IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ2,3 production by HBECs treated for 24h with PRR ligands.
Poly (I:C) (TLR3), 3p-hpRNA/LyoVec (RIG-I) and transfected Poly (I:C) (RIG-I/MDA5) were used. Mean with SEM is
depicted. Each dot represents a biological replicate. (D-G) Heatmap representation of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-12p70,
GMCSF, IL-10 and CXCL10 production by PMBCs (D), Monocytes (E), cDCs (F), moDCs (G) treated for 24h with PRR
ligands. 3p-hpRNA/LyoVec (RIG-I), cGAMP (STING), CpG(C) (TLR9), LPS (TLR4), Poly (I:C) (TLR3), R848 (TLR7/8)
were used. (D-G) The color is proportional to the Log10 transformed concentration (pg/ml) of each cytokine. Rows in
each group represent different donors as depicted in the annotation on the right. Statistics: (C) One-Way ANOVA with
Dunnett’s post-hoc test: ns, not significant (P>0.05); *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, and ****P<0.0001.
