ABSTRACT (150 words)

20

Vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are essential

21

for combating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Neutralizing antibody

22

responses to the original Wuhan-Hu-1 strain that were generated during infection and

23

vaccination showed lower effectiveness against variants of concern. Here, we demonstrated that

24

mouse plasma induced by protein nanoparticles that present rationally designed S2GΔHR2

25

spikes can neutralize the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants with comparable titers. The

26

mechanism of nanoparticle vaccine-induced immunity was examined in mice for an I3-01v9 60-

27

mer that presents 20 stabilized spikes. Compared with the soluble spike, this nanoparticle

28

showed 6-fold longer retention, 4-fold greater presentation on follicular dendritic cell dendrites,

29

and 5-fold higher germinal center reactions in lymph node follicles. Intact nanoparticles in lymph

30

node tissues were visualized by transmission electron microscopy. In conclusion, spike-

31

presenting protein nanoparticles that induce robust long-lived germinal centers may provide a

32

vaccine solution for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

40

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to more than 124 million infection cases and 2.7 million deaths

41

globally. It has been reported that the human antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike antigens

42

in COVID-19 patients can be sustained for several months after infection (1-5). However,

43

recently identified variants of concern (VOCs) exhibit higher transmissibility and resistance to

44

prior immunity as SARS-CoV-2 continues to adapt to the human host (6, 7). One such variant,

45

B.1.1.7, emerged from southeast England in October 2020 and accounted for two-thirds of new

46

infections in London in December 2020, with a higher transmission rate (43-90%) and risk of

47

mortality (32-104%) than previously circulating strains (8-11). Other variants, such as B.1.351

48

and P.1, also became prevalent in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and KwaZulu-Natal

49

provinces in South Africa and in Manaus, Brazil, respectively (7, 12-14). The rise of SARS-

50

CoV-2 VOCs and their rapid spread worldwide will likely result in more infection cases,

51

hospitalizations, and potentially more deaths, further straining healthcare resources (14).

52

To date, seven COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for emergency use in humans,

53

with more than 100 candidates being assessed in various phases of clinical trials (15). With the

54

exception of inactivated whole-virion vaccines, diverse platforms have been used to deliver the

55

recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike, such as mRNA-encapsulating liposomes (e.g., BNT162b2 and

56

mRNA-1273), adenovirus vectors (e.g., ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 [AZD1222], CTII-nCoV, Sputnik

57

V, and Ad26.COV2.S), and nanoparticles (e.g., NVX-CoV2373). These vaccines demonstrated

58

65-96% efficacies in Phase 3 trials, with reduced morbidity and mortality associated with

59

COVID-19 disease (16-20). However, a notable loss of vaccine efficacy against new SARS-

60

CoV-2 variants was reported because of spike mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD;

61

e.g., K417N, E484K, and N501Y), N-terminal domain (NTD; e.g., L18F, D80A, D215G, and

62

Δ242-244), and other regions that are critical to spike stability (e.g., D614G) (7, 21-28). Among

63

circulating VOCs, the B.1.351 lineage appeared to be most resistant to neutralization by

64

convalescent plasma (9.4-fold) and vaccine sera (10.3- to 12.4-fold) (29), while a lesser degree

65

of reduction was observed for an early variant, B.1.1.7 (30, 31). Based on these findings, it was

66

suggested that vaccines would need to be updated periodically to maintain protection against

67

rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 (24, 32, 33). This raises the concern that herd immunity may not

68

be achievable with current vaccines and highlights the necessity of developing vaccines that can

69

elicit a broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) response to SARS-CoV-2 variants (24, 28). As

70

previously reported (34-40), the production of a bNAb response relies on long-lived germinal

71

center (GC) reactions to activate precursor B cells, stimulate affinity maturation, and form long-

72

term immune memory. Antigen retention and presentation within lymph node follicles are key to

73

the induction of long-lived GC reactions (34, 36) and thus should be a main criterion in the

74

development of bNAb-producing vaccines.

75

We previously investigated the cause of SARS-CoV-2 spike metastability and rationally

76

designed the S2GΔHR2 spike, which was displayed on three self-assembling protein

77

nanoparticle (SApNP) platforms, including ferritin (FR) 24-mer and multilayered E2p and I3-

78

01v9 60-mers, as COVID-19 vaccine candidates (41) (Fig. 1A). Notably, the I3-01v9 SApNP

79

that presents 20 stabilized spikes induced a potent NAb response against both SARS-CoV-1 and

80

SARS-CoV-2, in addition to critically needed T cell responses (41). Here, we first examined the

81

neutralizing activity of mouse plasma induced by these rationally designed vaccine constructs

82

against representative SARS-CoV-2 variants. We then investigated how SApNPs “behave” in

83

lymph nodes and induce GCs in the mouse model by characterizing vaccine delivery and

84

immunological responses at the intraorgan, intracellular, and intercellular levels. Our findings

85

suggest that a spike-presenting protein nanoparticle vaccine may confer broad protection against

86

SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.

87

We first assessed the neutralizing activity of polyclonal plasma elicited by various spike

88

and SApNP vaccine formulations in pseudoparticle (pp) neutralization assays (42). Mouse

89

plasma at week 5 after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of adjuvanted vaccine antigens (50 μg)

90

from our previous study were analyzed against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain, Wuhan-Hu-1, as

91

a baseline for comparison (Fig. 1B). The soluble S2PECTO spike elicited the lowest 50%

92

inhibitory dilution (ID50) titers, whereas the soluble S2GΔHR2 spike induced a stronger NAb

93

response, showing a 7.1-fold higher (or 8.1 times) average ID50 titer, which did not reach

94

statistical significance because of within-group variation. All three spike SApNP vaccines

95

elicited superior neutralizing antibody responses compared with the soluble S2PECTO spike (41,

96

43). Notably, the I3-01v9 SApNP vaccine showed the most potent NAb response, with an

97

average ID50 titer of 2090, which was 8.1-fold higher than the soluble S2PECTO spike. Despite the

98

differences in ID50 titers, the overall pattern remained the same as observed in our previous study

99

(41). These differences can be attributed to the inherent variation of pseudovirus neutralization

100

assays (42) (see Methods).Next, we assessed neutralizing activity against three major SARS-

101

CoV-2 variants (Fig. 1C, fig. S1A, B). The I3-01v9 SApNP induced a stronger NAb response

102

against three VOCs, with 0.5-fold (B.1.1.7), 0.8-fold (B.1.351), and 1.8-fold (P.1) higher ID50

103

titers compared with the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (Fig. 1C). These results were confirmed in a second

104

experiment, in which mice were intraperitoneally immunized with low doses (5 and 15 μg) of I3-

105

01v9 SApNP. Remarkably, all three SARS-CoV-2 VOC-pps were neutralized by mouse plasma,

106

with ID50 titers comparable to the high-dose group (45 μg; fig. S1C, D). To examine whether

107

routes of injection affect the elicitation of NAb responses against VOCs, we performed a third

108

experiment, in which a low dose (3.3 μg) of adjuvanted antigen was intradermally administered

109

into four footpads (i.e., 0.8 μg/footpad). The large (~55-60 nm) E2p and I3-01v9 SApNPs that

110

present 20 S2GΔHR2 spikes yielded higher ID50 titers than the soluble S2GΔHR2 spike (Fig.

111

1D, fig. S1E, F), whereas a significant reduction of neutralizing titers against the variants was

112

observed for mouse plasma from the S2GΔHR2 group (Fig. 1E, fig. S1E, F), suggesting that

113

nanoparticle display is critical for eliciting a bNAb response. The E2p and I3-01v9 SApNP

114

groups exhibited comparable or stronger NAb responses against three variants relative to the

115

original Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (Fig. 1E). A panel of human NAbs was previously used to validate

116

the SARS-CoV-2-pp neutralization assays, in addition to evaluating the antigenicity of rationally

117

designed spikes and SApNPs (41). This panel of human NAbs was tested against SARS-CoV-2-

118

pps that carry various VOC spikes (Fig. 1F, fig. S1G). Lower potency, measured by the 50%

119

inhibitory concentration (IC50), was observed for all human NAbs against B.1.351 and P.1

120

variants, with the exception of NAb S309, which was identified from a SARS-CoV-1 patient

121

(44). This finding is consistent with previous reports on convalescent patient plasma (29-31). As

122

a negative control, mouse plasma induced by the S2GΔHR2-presenting I3-01v9 SApNP was

123

tested against pseudoviruses carrying the murine leukemia virus (MLV) Env, or MLV-pps.

124

Nonspecific neutralization was not detected (fig. S1H, I). Altogether, these results demonstrated

125

a clear advantage of spike-presenting SApNPs in eliciting a strong bNAb response against

126

SARS-CoV-2 VOCs compared with soluble spikes.

127

Next, we studied in vivo behaviors of the S2GΔHR2 spike and two large SApNPs to

128

understand vaccine-induced immunity and why nanoparticles outperform soluble spikes in terms

129

of bNAb elicitation. We first examined the distribution of S2GΔHR2-presenting I3-01v9

130

SApNPs in mouse lymph nodes via footpad injection (10 μg). The mice were sacrificed 12 h

131

after single-dose (Fig. 2A) and prime-boost (Fig. 2B) regimens. The axillary, brachial, and

132

popliteal sentinel lymph nodes were isolated for histological analysis. The lymph node tissues

133

were stained with the human anti-spike antibody P2B-2F6 (45) to characterize SARS-CoV-2

134

spikes presented on the I3-01v9 SApNPs. Consistent with our previous study (46), SApNPs

135

accumulated in lymph node follicles, regardless of the number of doses. SApNPs were

136

sequestrated in the center of lymph node follicles after a single-dose (Fig. 2A, images on the left,

137

schematics on the right), but were located along the outer layer of expanded lymph node follicles

138

after the second injection due to preexisting humoral immunity (i.e., GC reactions) that was

139

induced by the first dose (Fig. 2B, images on the left, schematics on the right). Overall, the

140

majority of SApNPs accumulated in lymph node follicles, while their distribution differed

141

slightly depending on the doses.

142

In this context, we examined patterns of trafficking and lymph node follicle retention for

143

soluble S2GΔHR2 spike vs. the S2GΔHR2-presenting E2p and I3-01v9 SApNPs. To facilitate

144

this analysis, the mice were sacrificed 2 h to 8 weeks after a single dose (Fig. 2C) and 2 h to 5

145

weeks after the boost (Fig. 2D). The injection dose was normalized to the total amount of protein

146

(10 μg) per injection into each footpad (40 μg/mouse). As shown in Fig. 2C, the S2GΔHR2

147

spikes that trafficked into lymph node follicles at 2 h cleared within 48 h. In contrast, the two

148

large SApNPs accumulated in the subcapsular sinus at 2 h and then trafficked into follicles 12 h

149

after the single-dose injection. Remarkably, I3-01v9 SApNPs remained detectable in lymph node

150

follicles after 2 weeks, suggesting 6-fold longer retention than the S2GΔHR2 spike (Fig. 2C).

151

The results for these protein nanoparticles are thus consistent with the pattern of size dependency

152

that was observed for ovalbumin-conjugated gold nanoparticles in our previous study (46), in

153

which small (5-15 nm) nanoparticles cleared shortly after the injection, whereas large (50-100

154

nm) nanoparticles were retained in lymph node follicles for weeks. Similar patterns of antigen

155

retention were observed after the second injection, although the boost appeared to exert a more

156

positive effect on the soluble spike, which could be detected in lymph node follicles at 48 h (Fig.

157

2D). Nonetheless, prolonged retention was observed for both E2p and I3-01v9 SApNPs 2 weeks

158

after the boost injection. Overall, the multivalent display of S2GΔHR2 spikes on the I3-01v9

159

SApNP resulted in 325- and 4-fold greater accumulation in lymph node follicles compared with

160

the soluble spike 48 h after the single-dose (Fig. 2E) and prime-boost (Fig. 2F) injections,

161

respectively. These findings reveal the advantage of a leading vaccine candidate identified in our

162

previous study, S2GΔHR2-10GS-I3-01v9-L7P (41), in terms of spike antigen retention in lymph

163

node follicles.

164

Next, we determined the involvement of resident cells in antigen retention in lymph node

165

follicles. Recent studies reported that follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) are resident stromal cells

166

in follicles and can retain immune complexes, virus-like particles, virus, and bacteria (46-51).

167

Follicular dendritic cells are key to naive antigen retention, GC initiation and maintenance, and B

168

cell affinity maturation (39, 52-55). Here, we hypothesized that FDCs comprise the major cell

169

population in lymph node follicles that retain SARS-CoV-2 spikes and spike-presenting

170

SApNPs. To test this hypothesis, we administered vaccines via footpad injections and collected

171

mouse lymph nodes at the peak of accumulation (12 h) after single-dose (Fig. 3A) and prime-

172

boost (Fig. 3B) injections. Lymph node tissue samples were stained with the anti-spike antibody

173

P2B-2F6 (45) for the spike antigen and anti-CD21 and CD169 antibodies for FDCs and

174

subcapsular sinus macrophages, respectively. The S2GΔHR2 spike and SApNP (E2p or I3-01v9)

175

signals colocalized with FDC (CD21+) networks in lymph node follicles (Fig. 3A, B). This result

176

confirmed the critical role of FDC networks in mediating vaccine retention in lymph node

177

follicles.

178

The induction of potent bNAb responses by spike-presenting SApNPs (Fig. 1) suggests

179

the effective activation of naïve B cells and subsequent recalls by crosslinking B cell receptors

180

(56-58). However, still unclear are the manners in which FDC networks present SApNPs to B

181

cells to trigger such a bNAb response. Here, we analyzed the interface between FDC networks

182

and B cells by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Briefly, fresh lymph nodes were

183

isolated and directly immersed in fixative. The processed tissue samples were sectioned and

184

stained on copper grids for TEM analysis. We first determined whether SApNPs, such as the

185

S2GΔHR2-presenting I3-01v9 SApNP, remain intact in vivo (fig. S2). Mouse lymph nodes were

186

isolated 2 h after the injection of a high dose (50 μg) of the non-adjuvanted I3-01v9 SApNP. The

187

TEM images revealed that round-shape granules corresponding to intact SApNP aligned on the

188

macrophage surface or inside endolysosomes of the macrophage in a lymph node (fig. S2). We

189

next studied the relative location between FDCs and I3-01v9 SApNPs and how FDCs present

190

SApNPs to B cells. Mouse lymph nodes were collected 2, 12, and 48 h after a single-dose (50

191

μg) and 12 h after the boost of the I3-01v9 SApNP vaccine. The FDCs exhibited the

192

characteristic morphology of long dendrites that surrounded and interacted with B cells in lymph

193

node follicles (Fig. 3C, fig. S3). While few I3-01v9 SApNPs were observed on FDC dendrites at

194

2 h (fig. S3D), notably more nanoparticles migrated to and aligned on FDC dendrites at 12 and

195

48 h (Fig. 3C, figs. S3A-C, yellow arrows). The TEM images indicated that FDCs can present

196

many SApNPs to neighboring B cells in this “hugging mode”, in which their long dendrites

197

brace B cells to maximize interactions between multivalently displayed spikes and B cell

198

receptors. These results demonstrated the intrinsic nature of FDCs as a reservoir for the

199

sequestration, retention, and presentation of virus-like particles, or SApNPs with similar

200

molecular traits, to initiate GC reactions.

201

Lastly, we investigated whether the prolonged retention of S2GΔHR2-presenting E2p and

202

I3-01v9 SApNPs induce more robust GCs in lymph node follicles than the soluble S2GΔHR2

203

spike. Immunohistological analysis was performed to characterize GC B cells (GL7+) and T

204

follicular helper (Tfh) cells (CD4+Bcl6+). For the I3-01v9 SApNP, 2 weeks after immunization,

205

we observed robust GCs in lymph node B cell follicles (B220+) with well-formed dark zone

206

(DZ) and light zone (LZ) compartments, which contain GC B cells, FDCs, and Tfh cells (35, 37,

207

59-62) (Fig. 4A). We then extended the analysis to the S2GΔHR2 spike and spike-presenting

208

SApNPs 2, 5, and 8 weeks after the single-dose injection (Fig. 4B, fig. S4A-C) and 2 and 5

209

weeks after the boost (Fig. 4C, fig. S4D, E). Two semi-quantitative metrics, the GC/FDC ratio

210

(i.e., whether GC formation is associated with an FDC network, %) and GC size (i.e., occupied

211

area), were used in this analysis. Overall, the soluble S2GΔHR2 spike and both large SApNPs

212

induced robust GCs 2 weeks after immunization (Fig. 4B, fig. S4A). The E2p and I3-01v9

213

SApNPs that present 20 S2GΔHR2 spikes induced robust, long-lived GCs, whereas the spike

214

alone failed to sustain robust GCs at week 8 with either the single-dose (Fig. 4B, D) or prime-

215

boost (Fig. 4C, E) injections. The I3-01v9 SApNP generated larger GCs than the soluble spike,

216

2.0-fold larger after the single-dose (Fig. 4B, D) and 2.4-fold larger after the boost (Fig. 4C, E),

217

measured at week 8.

218

We further characterized GC reactions by flow cytometry. Fresh mouse lymph nodes

219

were disaggregated into a single cell suspension and stained with an antibody cocktail to quantify

220

GC B cells and Tfh cells (fig. S5A). The results were consistent with the immunohistological

221

analysis, in which all spike-based vaccine antigens, including the S2GΔHR2 spike and SApNPs,

222

showed robust GCs at week 2 after the injection that declined over time, as measured at weeks 5

223

and 8 (Fig. 4F). The E2p and I3-01v9 SApNPs generated a larger population of GC B cells than

224

both the S2PECTO and S2GΔHR2 spikes at week 2 (fig. S5B, C). Although the boost dose had

225

little impact on the frequency of GC B cells and Tfh cells, it appeared to extend GC formation

226

within lymph nodes (Fig. 4F, G), which may promote B cell development toward bNAbs.

227

Notably, the GC B cell and Tfh cell populations elicited by the soluble S2GΔHR2 spike were

228

barely detectable 5 weeks after immunization (Figs. 4F, G). This result was reminiscent of a

229

recent study of an mRNA vaccine, in which GC reactions diminished to baseline levels at week 4

230

after a single-dose injection (63). The S2GΔHR2-presenting I3-01v9 SApNP generated 3.7/5.2-

231

fold more GC B cells and 3.7/4.4-fold more Tfh cells than the soluble S2GΔHR2 spike after

232

one/two-dose immunization at week 8 (Fig. 4G). Therefore, SApNPs that were retained on FDC

233

dendrites could present SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing epitopes to enable more effective B cell

234

recognition than the soluble spike, and consequently induce more robust and long-lived GCs in

235

lymph nodes.

236

To end the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines need to effectively block current and

237

emerging SARS-Cov-2 variants that evade NAb responses by mutating key epitopes on the viral

238

spike (24). Such vaccines must induce long-lasting GCs to facilitate the development of bNAbs.

239

Effective vaccine retention and presentation are critical for inducing and sustaining GC

240

reactions, which in turn promote the proliferation and affinity maturation of antigen-specific B

241

cells. Here, we found that the S2GΔHR2-presenting I3-01v9 SApNP, a vaccine candidate from

242

our recent study (41), elicited 6-fold longer retention and 4-fold greater accumulation in lymph

243

node follicles than the stabilized S2GΔHR2 spike alone with a prime-boost regimen (Fig. 2D, F).

244

This can be attributed to the intrinsic physiological properties of lymph nodes that mediate

245

vaccine trafficking and retention in follicles in a size-dependent manner, which would favor

246

retaining large (> 50 nm) virus-like nanoparticles (46-48, 64, 65). Supporting this notion are the

247

images of retained I3-01v9 SApNPs aligned on long FDC dendrites, suggesting that such protein

248

nanoparticles can present spike antigens to B cells for rapid initiation and then sustain GC

249

reactions in lymph node follicles for an extended period of time (Fig. 3, 4). Specifically, the

250

S2GΔHR2-presenting I3-01v9 SApNP generated 2.4-fold larger GCs and greater numbers of GC

251

B cells (5.2-fold) and Tfh cells (4.4-fold) than the soluble S2GΔHR2 spike with the prime-boost

252

regimen (Fig. 4). The findings in this study provide quantitative evidence that spike-presenting

253

SApNP vaccines are uniquely suited for inducing long-lived robust GCs in lymph node follicles.

254

Our analyses also provide potential explanations for the mechanism by which the S2GΔHR2-

255

presenting I3-01v9 SApNP can elicit a more effective bNAb response than the soluble spike (Fig.

256

1B) (32). Further investigation at the monoclonal level will reveal how bNAbs recognize

257

conserved epitopes and facilitate the rational design of SARS-CoV-2 spike antigens (24).

258

Superior NAb responses have been reported for other COVID-19 vaccine candidates that take

259

advantage of particulate display (66-78). Importantly, our S2GΔHR2-presenting I3-01v9 SApNP

260

vaccine elicited bNAb responses to three SARS-CoV-2 VOCs (Fig. 1), thus meeting a major

261

criterion for next-generation COVID-19 vaccines.

262

Protein vaccines have well-established records of both safety and effectiveness (79-82),

263

but they have yet to be deployed in the global campaign against the COVID-19 pandemic.

264

Through formulation with adjuvants to further enhance immune responses (83-88), protein

265

vaccines can be used either alone or as a booster for currently used nucleic acid vaccines. One

266

such protein vaccine, NVX-CoV2373 (full-length S2P spikes formulated with Matrix-MTM

267

adjuvant), showed 96.4% efficacy in human trials (89). In our studies, we formulated the spike-

268

presenting E2p and I3-01v9 SApNPs with the AddaVax and aluminum phosphate adjuvants (41),

269

which induced stronger GC reactions than non-adjuvanted SApNPs at week 2 (fig. S6). Further

270

development of these SApNP vaccines may benefit from a systematic analysis of adjuvants that

271

target diverse immune pathways. An in-depth understanding of how different vaccine platforms

272

(e.g., inactivated virions, mRNAs, viral vectors, and nanoparticles) behave in vivo, such as

273

trafficking and retention in lymph nodes, interactions with immune cells, antigen processing and

274

presentation, and GC reactions and NAb responses, will provide insights into vaccine-induced

275

immunity (82, 90-92). This knowledge will in turn accelerate vaccine development against

276

SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging pathogens.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

278

SARS-CoV-2 spike and SApNP vaccine antigens

279

The design, expression, and purification of a stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike, S2GΔHR2, and

280

three SApNPs that present either 8 or 20 S2GΔHR2 spikes were described in our recent study

281

(41). Briefly, the spike gene of the SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (GenBank accession no.

282

MN908947) was modified to include the mutations

283

addition to truncation of the HR2 stalk (ΔE1150-Q1208). The viral capsid protein SHP (Protein

284

Data Bank: 1TD0) was added as a C-terminal trimerization motif to stabilize the S2GΔHR2

285

trimer, resulting in a soluble S2GΔHR2-5GS-1TD0 spike (41). The S2GΔHR2 spike was

286

genetically fused to FR, multilayered E2p, and multilayered I3-01v9 with 5GS, 5GS, and 10GS

287

linkers, respectively, resulting in three S2GΔHR2-presenting SApNPs (41). An S2PECTO-5GS-

288

1TD0 spike construct that contained the mutations

289

without HR2 deletion (41) was included for comparison. All of the vaccine antigens were

transiently expressed in ExpiCHO cells and purified by a CR3022 antibody column and size-

291

exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superose 6 10/300 GL column as described previously

292

(41).

293
294

Animal immunization and sample collection

295

Similar immunization protocols were reported in our previous vaccine studies (41, 93-95).

296

Briefly, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines were followed for all

297

of the animal studies. BALB/c mice (6 weeks old) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory

298

and kept in ventilated cages in environmentally controlled rooms at The Scripps Research

299

Institute. The mouse studies were conducted according to Association for the Assessment and

300

Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care guidelines, and the protocols were approved by the

301

IACUC. For the immunogenicity study, the mice were intraperitoneally immunized at either

302

weeks 0 or 3 with 200 μl of antigen/adjuvant mix containing 5-50 μg of vaccine antigen and 100

303

μl of adjuvant (41) or immunized at weeks 0 and 3 with 20 μl of antigen/adjuvant mix containing

304

0.8 μg of vaccine antigen per injection (3.3 μg/mouse) and 10 μl of adjuvant per injection (four

305

footpads were injected with a total of 80 μl [20 μl/footpad]) via intradermal footpad injections.

306

For the mechanism study of vaccine trafficking, retention, and induced GCs, the mice were

307

immunized at weeks 0 and 3 with 20 μl of antigen/adjuvant mix containing 10 μg of vaccine

308

antigen and 10 μl of adjuvant per injection. To visualize S2GΔHR2-presenting I3-01v9 SApNPs

309

in lymph node tissues using TEM, the mice were immunized at weeks 0 and 3 with 70 μl of

310

antigen/adjuvant mix containing 50 μg of vaccine antigen and 20 μl of adjuvant per injection.

311

Vaccines were administered into intradermal footpads of mice using a 29-gauge insulin needle

312

under 3% isoflurane anesthesia with oxygen. Blood was drawn from the maxillary/facial vein

313

into an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-coated tube 2 weeks after each immunization.

314

Blood plasma was isolated after centrifugation at 14000 rotations per minute (rpm) for 10 min.

315

Plasma was heated and inactivated at 56°C for 30 min. The supernatant was then collected after

316

centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min. Plasma was used for the neutralization assay to determine

317

neutralizing antibody responses. The axillary, brachial, and popliteal sentinel lymph nodes were

318

collected at the end timepoint for further analysis.

320

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay

321

The SARS-CoV-2-pp neutralization assays were described in our previous study (41). Briefly,

322

SARS-CoV-2-pps were generated by the co-transfection of HEK293T cells with the HIV-1

323

pNL4-3.lucR-E- plasmid (obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS reagent program;

324

https://www.aidsreagent.org/) and the expression plasmid encoding the S gene of various SARS-

325

CoV-2 strains, including three variants: B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 (GISAID accession no.

326

EPI_ISL_601443, EPI_ISL_678597, and EPI_ISL_792680, respectively). The HEK293T-

327

hACE2 cell line (catalog no. NR-52511) and pcDNA3.1(-) vector containing the S gene of the

328

SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (catalog no. NR52420) were requested from the BEI

329

Resources (https://www.beiresources.org/) on September 23, 2020 and used in the pseudovirus

330

neutralization assays (42). Based on sequence alignment, spike mutations were incorporated into

331

the S gene of the original Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate (catalog no. NR52420) to create respective

332

expression plasmids for B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1. SARS-CoV-2-pp neutralization by immunized

333

mouse plasma and human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was performed according to a

334

previously described protocol (41). Using the same co-transfection expression system as

335

described above for the SARS-CoV-2-pps, we produced pseudoviruses carrying the murine

Histology, immunostaining, and imaging

342

The mice were sacrificed 2 h to 8 weeks after a single-dose and 2 h to 5 weeks after the boost

343

immunization. The axillary, brachial, and popliteal sentinel lymph nodes were isolated for

344

histological analysis. Fresh lymph nodes were rapidly merged into frozen section compound

345

(VWR International, catalog no. 95057-838) in a plastic cryomold (Tissue-Tek at VWR, catalog

346

no. 4565) using liquid nitrogen to preserve the antigens on the cell membrane and spike. Lymph

347

node samples were stored at -80°C and sent to the Centre for Phenogenomics on dry ice for

348

further sample processing. Tissue sections (8 μm) were cut on a cryostat (Cryostar NX70) and

349

collected on charged slides. Sections were post-fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and

350

permeabilized

351

immunostaining. Protein Block (Agilent) was used to block nonspecific antibody binding before

352

incubating the sections with primary antibody overnight at 4°C. After washing in TBST, the

353

sections were incubated in fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room

354

temperature. Lymph node tissue sections were stained with human anti-spike antibody P2B-2F6
