Abstract

22

In our group, we aim to understand metabolism in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans

23

and its relationships with gene expression, physiology and the response to therapeutic

24

drugs. On March 15, 2020, a stay-at-home order was put into effect in the state of

25

Massachusetts, USA, to flatten the curve of the spread of the novel SARS-CoV2 virus

26

that causes COVID-19. For biomedical researchers in our state, this meant putting a hold

27

on experiments for nine weeks until May 18, 2020. To keep the lab engaged and

28

productive, and to enhance communication and collaboration, we embarked on an in-lab

29

project that we all found important but that we never had the time for: the detailed

30

annotation and drawing of C. elegans metabolic pathways. As a result, we present

31

WormPaths, which is composed of two parts: 1) the careful manual annotation of

32

metabolic genes into pathways, categories and levels, and 2) 66 pathway maps that

33

include metabolites, metabolite structures, genes, reactions, and pathway connections

34

between maps. These maps are available on our WormFlux website. We show that

35

WormPaths provides easy-to-navigate maps and that the different levels in WormPaths

36

can be used for metabolic pathway enrichment analysis of transcriptomic data. In the

37

unfortunate event of additional lockdowns, we envision further developing these maps to

38

be more interactive, with an analogy of road maps that are available on mobile devices.

Introduction

43

Metabolism can be broadly defined as the total complement of reactions that degrade

44

and synthesize biomolecules to produce the biomass and generate the energy organisms

45

need to grow, function and reproduce. Metabolic reactions function in metabolic pathways

46

that are interconnected to form the metabolic network. In metabolic networks, the nodes

47

are metabolites and the edges are conversion and transport reactions carried out by

48

metabolic enzymes and transporters.

49

Genome-scale metabolic network models provide mathematical tools that are

50

invaluable for the systems-level analysis of metabolism. Such models have been

51

constructed for numerous organisms, including bacteria, yeast, the nematode

52

Caenorhabditis elegans and humans [1]. Metabolic network models are extremely useful

53

because they can be used with flux balance analysis (FBA) to derive specific insights and

54

hypotheses. For example, gene expression profiling data can be used to gain insight into

55

metabolic network activity at pathway, reaction and metabolite levels under different

56

conditions, or in particular tissues [2-5].

57

Visualizing the metabolic pathways that together comprise the metabolic network

58

of an organism is extremely useful to aid in the interpretation of results from different types

59

of large-scale, systems-level studies such as gene expression profiling by RNA-seq,

60

phenotypic screens by RNAi or CRISPR/Cas9, or genetic interaction mapping. Several

61

resources are available online for the visualization and navigation of metabolic pathways.

62

Probably the most widely used is the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes

63

(KEGG), a platform that provides pan-organism annotations and metabolic pathway maps

64

[6]. Other online resources include MetaCyc [7], BRENDA [8] and REACTOME [9]. While

65

all of these platforms are extremely useful resources for metabolic pathway mapping,

66

enzyme classification, and pathway visualization, they can have incomplete or incorrect

67

pathway and enzyme information due to a lack of extensive manual curations for specific

68

organisms. As a result, map navigation can be rather non-intuitive.

69

Over the last five decades or so, the free-living nematode C. elegans has proven

70

to be an excellent genetic model to gain insights into a variety of biological processes,

71

including development, reproduction, neurobiology/behavior, and aging [10-12]. More

72

recently, C. elegans has emerged as a powerful model to understand basic metabolic

73

processes [13, 14]. C. elegans is a bacterivore that can be fed different bacterial species

74

and strains in the lab [15, 16]. Numerous studies have begun to shed light on the

75

metabolic mechanisms by which different bacterial diets can affect the animal’s

76

metabolism [17-23]. For instance, we have discovered that, when fed a diet low in vitamin

77

B12, C. elegans adjusts the two metabolic pathways that rely on this cofactor. Specifically,

78

it rewires propionate degradation by transcriptionally activating a propionate shunt and

79

upregulates Methionine/S-adenosylmethionine cycle genes to adjust cycle activity [24-

80

27]. To enable more global analyses of C. elegans metabolism, we have previously

81

reconstructed its first genome-scale metabolic network model [2]. The recently updated

82

version of this model includes 1,314 genes, 907 metabolites and 2,230 reactions, and is

83

referred to as iCEL1314 [3]. Information about this network and all the components

84

involved is publicly available on our WormFlux website (http://wormflux.umassmed.edu).

85

Over time, we found that we were missing metabolic pathway maps that are easy

86

to navigate and that can be used to help interpret results from phenotypic screens and

87

gene expression profiling experiments. We used KEGG pathways, which provide generic,

88

non-organism-specific visualizations, as a starting point to redraw maps of C. elegans

89

metabolism on paper to help us interpret our data. In KEGG, enzymes are indicated by

90

Enzyme Commission numbers and maps are colored with those enzymes predicted to be

91

present in an organism of interest; however, organism-specific pathways cannot be

92

extracted. Further, many of these maps contain incorrect or partially correct reactions for

93

C. elegans. We found that redrawing pathway maps that contain information about

94

metabolites, genes encoding the proteins that catalyze metabolic reactions or transport

95

metabolites between cells or cellular compartments, molecular structures, and used

96

cofactors was very helpful to our studies [25-27].

97

From March 15 to May 18, 2020, experimental biomedical research in

98

Massachusetts was temporarily halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We thought we

99

could use this time, the duration of which was of course unknown at the start, to design

100

an in-lab ‘crowdsourcing-like’ project we refer to as WormPaths, in which we carefully

101

assigned C. elegans metabolic genes to pathways and visualized these pathways in a

102

standardized format. In total, WormPaths contains 66 maps covering major metabolic

103

pathways (glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle, etc.), amino acid metabolism, and

104

pathways fundamental to C. elegans physiology (collagen biosynthesis, ascaroside

105

biosynthesis, propionate degradation, etc.). Each map connects to other pathways,

106

thereby covering the entire iCEL1314 network. Importantly, the network was expanded

107

by adding reactions and genes found in the literature that were heretofore missed. This

108

in-lab ‘crowdsourcing’ project proved to have numerous scientific and non-scientific

109

benefits. First, and most importantly, we created the metabolic pathway maps we had

110

been missing. Second, by assigning different tasks to pairs or small sub-groups of lab

111

members, we ensured that trainees kept in touch via videoconference to discuss how to

112

proceed and to evaluate drawn maps. The collaborative project provided lab members

113

with a scientific goal and sense of purpose that boosted morale. Maps were carefully

114

curated, hand-drawn, and then visualized in a standardized Scalable Vector Graphics

115

(SVG) format, which allows interactive usage in web applications.

116

WormPaths annotations and maps are publicly available on the WormFlux website

117

(http://wormflux.umassmed.edu). Our careful gene-to-pathway annotations at different

118

levels (see Results) enable statistical enrichment analyses. Finally, our maps may provide

119

a useful format for the drawing of metabolic pathway maps in other organisms. In the

120

unfortunate event of additional lockdowns, we envision further refining the maps through

121

detailed literature reviews and experiments.

124
125

Assigning C. elegans metabolic genes to pathways at different levels

126

To generate WormPaths, we built on available resources, most notably the iCEL1314

127

metabolic network model [3], KEGG [6], MetaCyc [7], WormBase [28], and literature

128

searches (Fig 1A). Briefly, we manually curated each of the 1314 genes present in the

129

iCEL1314 model and assigned them to one or more pathway (see methods). In addition,

130

we used a “category” annotation for metabolic genes that best fit in complexes or enzyme

131

categories rather than pathways (Fig 1B). Examples of this include the electron transport

132

chain (ETC) that carries out oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria, guanylate

133

cyclases that convert guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to cyclic guanosine monophosphate

134

(cGMP), and vacuolar ATPases that maintain proton gradients across organellar plasma

135

membranes. Because all metabolic pathways are connected into a metabolic network and

136

some pathways are embedded, or nested, into larger pathways, we decided to annotate

137

C. elegans metabolic pathways at different levels. Categorizing genes into pathways at

138

different levels, enables enrichment analyses at different levels of resolution (see below).

139

Level 1 includes the broadest assignment to ten annotations: amino acids, carbohydrates,

140

cofactors and vitamins, energy, lipids, nucleotides, one-carbon cycle, reactive oxygen

141

species, other amino acids, and other (S1 Tab). Levels 2, 3 and 4 further refine pathways

142

within Level 1 annotations. For instance, the propionate shunt [25] (Level 4) is part of

143

propionate degradation (Level 3), which is part of short-chain fatty acid degradation (Level

144

2), which is part of lipids (Level 1) (Fig 1C, S1 Tab). Altogether, there are 10 groups of

145

pathways or categories at Level 1, 61 groups at Level 2, 79 groups at Level 3, and 85

146

groups at Level 4. Not all Levels 2 or 3 can be further subdivided, and therefore there is

147

redundancy at the higher levels (3 and 4) (S1 Tab). For each pathway, we decided as a

148

group which level would be most useful for visualization as a map and a team of two lab

149

members worked together to design and draw a draft map (S2 Tab). For example, Level

150

2 branched-chain amino acid degradation can be subdivided into three maps at Level 3:

151

isoleucine, leucine, and valine degradation, each of which is visualized separately.

152

Another example is methionine metabolism (Level 3), which can be further refined to

153

methionine salvage and methionine/S-adenosylmethionine cycle (Level 4). Other amino

154

acids need no further categorization and maps are drawn at Level 2, such as histidine

155

and lysine degradation.

156

In iCEL1314, and therefore in WormPaths, 32% of genes are annotated to multiple

157

pathways. While many genes do in fact act in multiple pathways, others may be annotated

158

to multiple pathways because gene-protein-reaction annotations are based on

159

homologies with known enzymes, and the exact participation of each gene in different

160

pathways cannot be resolved without experimentation. For instance, the acyl-CoA

161

dehydrogenase-encoding gene acdh-1 is annotated to different degradation reactions in

162

amino acid and lipid metabolism (Fig 1D, S3-S5 Tabs). However, only its role in the

163

propionate shunt has been experimentally characterized [25]. Importantly, its close

164

paralog acdh-2 is annotated to the same pathways but was experimentally shown not to

165

be involved in propionate shunt [25]. Future biochemical and genetic studies are needed

166

to disentangle which enzymes can catalyze multiple reactions, and which are specific to

167

individual reactions.

168
169

WormPaths maps – visualization and navigation

170

After map level assignments and pathway design, maps were sketched digitally or by

171

hand and electronically uploaded to Google Docs for manual conversion to SVG format,

172

an Extensible Markup Language (XML)-based vector image format for general useability

173

on the Internet by both individual users and computer programs. Metabolites for all

174

products and reactants were downloaded from KEGG and other resources (see Methods)

175

and some that were not available were hand drawn. All reactions on the SVG maps were

176

manually verified and checked for errors. Maps were then uploaded to the WormFlux

177

webpage, where they are available in a drop-down list. All maps are searchable and

178

clickable. For example, a search for the gene metr-1 will result in the WormFlux gene

179

page for metr-1, which has links to the methionine/S-adenosylmethionine cycle and folate

180

cycle pathways, each of which brings the corresponding map with the metr-1 gene

181

highlighted (S1 Fig). In reverse, clicking on a gene in any map leads to the associated

182

WormFlux page, where key identifiers and reactions in which the gene is involved are

183

listed. The same is true when searching and clicking metabolites.

184

In total, WormPaths provides 66 maps of C. elegans metabolic pathways, that

185

connect into the larger iCEL1314 network. Fig 2A shows an example of the WormPaths

186

map for glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. This is a Level 2 map that is part of carbohydrates

187

(Level 1). The keys for different types of reactions are provided in S2 Fig and S3 Fig. In

188

metabolic networks, nodes are metabolites and edges are the reactions in which these

189

metabolites are converted into one another, or transported between cellular

190

compartments, or between the cell and the extracellular environment. The edges in these

191

maps are black for enzymatic reactions and green for transport reactions (Fig 2B). The

192

genes encoding the enzymes predicted to catalyze the reactions are indicated in blue,

193

and co-reactants are indicated in orange (Fig 2A). Some reactions have multiple

194

alternative genes associated with them. These “OR” genes are separated by a vertical

195

bar (|). For example, in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis the interconversion between

196

phosphoenolpyruvate (pep) and oxaloacetate (oaa) is associated with pck-1, pck-2, or

197

pck-3 (Fig 2A). None of these genes is associated with any other reaction and therefore

198

they may function in different conditions or in different tissues [3]. Indeed, at the second

199

larval (L2) stage, two of these three genes show very distinct tissue expression patterns,

200

while the mRNA for the third gene (pck-3) was undetectable (S4 Fig)[29]. For edges

201

where multiple enzymes together catalyze a reaction, an ampersand (&) is used to

202

indicate “AND” genes. For example, pdha-1 and pdhb-1 are both required in the pyruvate

203

dehydrogenase complex that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate (pyr) into acetyl-CoA

204

(accoa) (Fig 2A).

205

For metabolite names both in WormPaths (Fig 2A) and in WormFlux [2] we used

206

Biochemical Genetic and Genomic (BiGG) database abbreviations where available [30].

207

The transportability of metabolites between subcellular compartments is indicated by a

208

colored circle (Fig 2B), and the number of pathways connected between each metabolite

209

is indicated by a grayscale square. When metabolites are hovered over by the cursor, the

210

full name, formula, and chemical structure of the metabolite appear in a pop-up window

211

(Fig 2C). For many transport reactions, the transporter is not yet known and only few

212

have associated genes, or the transport gene is not part of the iCEL1314 metabolic

213

model. We found that, by having multiple people manually evaluate different metabolic

214

genes and pathways, the iCEL1314 metabolic model can be further improved. For

215

example, we found that the conversion of γ-linolenoyl-CoA (lnlncgcoa) to stearidonyl-CoA

216

(strdnccoa) by fat-1 was missing from the model even though this reaction is described

217

in the literature (Fig 2D) [31].

218
219

WormPaths advantages

220

Metabolic maps provided by KEGG are extremely useful and frequently published in the

221

primary literature (e.g., [32, 33]). However, these maps can be non-intuitive for several

222

reasons. First, these ‘pan-organism’ maps display all the chemistry known for a particular

223

pathway based on enzymes identified by Enzyme Commission number. However, many

224

reactions can be found in some organisms but not others. For instance, many reactions

10

225

are specific to prokaryotes. By selecting an organism of choice, here C. elegans, KEGG

226

colors the boxes representing enzymes in green if the enzyme is predicted to occur in

227

that organism (Fig 3A). Second, one has to hover over the enzyme box to visualize the

228

associated gene(s). Third, there can be a lot of overlap between different pathways, and

229

pathways in WormPaths have been greatly simplified without losing critical information

230

(Fig 3B). For example, the C. elegans pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis map in KEGG

231

looks extremely complicated, but many of the boxes in the KEGG map are white,

232

indicating that there is no known gene for this reaction in C. elegans. Further, the KEGG

233

map contains components of cysteine and methionine metabolism, arginine and proline

234

metabolism, propionate degradation, glycolysis, and other overlapping pathways. The

235

WormPaths map strips away these excess genes and pathways and focuses solely on

236

pantothenate and CoA formation (Fig 3B). In this specific example connections to other

237

pathways from the terminal metabolites are not indicated by boxes due to the fact that

238

cys-L, ctp, cmp, and coa all connect to more than four other pathways, making the map

239

cumbersome to navigate. The connecting pathways can be viewed on the WormFlux

240

website by clicking the metabolite of interest.

241

In addition to simplifying metabolic pathway maps, we also extended several

242

WormPaths maps relative to KEGG. For instance, the WormPaths ketone body

243

metabolism map has additional conversions with associated genes, relative to the map

244

available in KEGG (Fig 4A, 4B). More precise connections to other pathways, transport

245

reactions, and subcellular localization of the reactions are visualized in WormPaths.

246

In KEGG, genes are associated with any pathway assigned to that gene by gene-

247

protein-reaction associations. However, sometimes these reactions can be isolated

11

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.22.424026; this version posted December 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

248

because surrounding reactions are not found in the organism of interest, thus the isolated

249

reaction does not connect to the larger pathway or network of said organism. The isolated

250

reactions may be incorrect annotations that are not likely to exist in the organism, or they

251

may have been incorrectly inserted into the pathway based on homology to another

252

organism [1]. For instance, the aldehyde dehydrogenase alh-2 is associated with 15

253

KEGG pathways (Fig 5A). However, in several of these KEGG reactions, alh-2 is

254

associated with one or more isolated reactions that are not connected to iCEL1314 [3]

255

(Fig 5B). This can be further visualized in the KEGG pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis

256

map from Fig 3A; enzyme EC1.2.1.3 on the lower left is not connected to the rest of the

257

pathway. Further, only five of the 15 KEGG pathways associated with alh-2 have the

258

enzyme connected to the rest of the pathway via other C. elegans enzymes

259

(glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, glycerolipid metabolism, leucine degradation, isoleucine

260

degradation, and valine degradation). Altogether, WormPaths identifies four pathways for

261

alh-2, and all are shared with KEGG (Fig 5A). Refining gene-to-pathway annotations in

262

WormPaths is especially important for statistical analyses; when a gene is incorrectly

263

associated with different pathways, this can affect the significance of detected

264

enrichments.

265
266

WormPaths levels can be used for pathway or gene set enrichment analysis

267

To determine how the levels in WormPaths can be used to identify high-resolution

268

metabolic pathway enrichment in transcriptomic data, we analyzed a previously published

269

RNA-seq dataset measuring the transcriptomes of untreated animals, animals treated

270

with 20 nM vitamin B12, or 20 nM vitamin B12 and 40 mM propionate [26]. We performed

271

pathway enrichment analysis using the differentially expressed genes from this dataset

272

and WormPaths associated pathway(s) for each gene at all four levels (S5 Tab) using

273

hypergeometric distribution. This approach confirmed our previous findings that

274

propionate degradation by the shunt pathway and the Met/SAM cycle are enriched in this

275

dataset [26, 27](Fig 6).

276

In collaboration with the Walker lab, we previously developed WormCat, an online

277

tool for identifying genome-scale coexpressed gene sets [34] (Fig 6). In WormCat, genes

278

are assigned to a single functional annotation, while in WormPaths, genes can be

279

assigned to multiple reactions and, therefore, pathways. This, together with the inclusion

280

of different Levels of metabolism, allows gene enrichment analysis at greater resolution

281

(Fig 6). In contrast to WormCat, however, WormPaths is limited to the genes included in

282

the iCEL1314 model [3]. Given the advanced curation of the genes in WormPaths, using

283

these gene sets provides a complementary level of resolution for the analysis of metabolic

284

pathways, relative to WormCat. Thus, we suggest that researchers first use WormCat for

285

gene set enrichment analysis and that they include WormPaths in their analyses when

286

they find an enrichment for metabolic genes. Finally, our high-resolution metabolic

287

pathway annotations can be integrated as custom gene-sets while performing other kinds

288

of enrichment analysis, for example using classical Gene Set Enrichment Analysis [35] to

289

extract specific desired information from gene expression profiling data.

Conclusion and vision

292

We have developed WormPaths, an expandable online catalog of C. elegans metabolic

293

pathway maps and gene annotations. Our overall annotations predict a total of more than

294

3,000 metabolic genes in C. elegans, based on homologies with metabolic enzymes or

295

protein domains [2]. Therefore, metabolic network models such as iCEL1314 continue to

296

grow and evolve as more experimental data becomes available. We encourage C.

297

elegans researchers to contact us and help with updates and additions, and to point out

298

any errors they may find. We expect that new metabolic reactions and metabolites will

299

continue to be added to future versions of iCEL as they are discovered. For instance, the

300

iCEL1314 model incorporates the relatively recently discovered ascaroside biosynthesis

301

pathway [3]. In the future, we hope to visualize changes in gene expression, metabolite

302

concentrations, and potentially metabolic rewiring, which can occur under different dietary

303

or environmental conditions. Altogether, WormPaths builds on and provides advantages

304

over KEGG and the visualization strategy used to develop WormPaths should be

305

applicable to other model organisms.

Materials and methods

309

Design of pathway maps

310

The design of pathway maps aimed at capturing and visualizing metabolic functions in

311

such a way that would be broadly useful for both statistical analyses and navigation

312

purposes. The starting point for pathway definitions was the pathway annotations of

313

reactions and genes of iCEL1314 in Wormflux and in KEGG. Existing pathways were then

314

split and/or modified such that the functional resolution of pathways was increased

315

without disrupting the coherence of reactions, while the number of overlapping reactions

316

was minimized. For example, valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation pathway (KEGG)

14

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.22.424026; this version posted December 23, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

317

was first divided into three maps to increase pathway resolution: valine degradation,

318

leucine degradation, and isoleucine degradation. Then, a reaction that existed in the

319

original pathway that converts propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA (i.e., RM01859 in

320

iCEL1314 and R01859 in KEGG) was removed from valine degradation and isoleucine

321

degradation maps to avoid a redundant overlap with propionate degradation, where this

322

reaction serves as a starting point. In KEGG, R01859 is associated with glyoxylate and

323

dicarboxylate metabolism in addition to valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation and

324

propionate metabolism, thus appearing in three places. However, propionyl-CoA to

325

methlymalonyl-CoA conversion is clearly the first step of canonical propionate

326

degradation.

327

Typically, pathways were designed to start or end with three types of metabolites:

328

(i) the main substrate or product by definition (e.g. histidine is the starting point in histidine

329

degradation, and collagen is the endpoint in collagen biosynthesis), (ii) a connection to

330

other pathways (e.g., valine degradation ends with propionyl-CoA through which it is

331

connected to propionate metabolism), and (iii) an endpoint that can be transported to or

332

from extracellular space (e.g., histamine is produced in histidine degradation pathway and

333

exported). The connection of a terminal metabolite to other pathways are indicated in

334

maps by clickable pathway boxes as in KEGG, unless the metabolite is associated with

335

more than two other pathways. When a terminal metabolite is not associated with any

336

other pathway, a proper transport that explains the source or fate of the metabolite is

337

included. If a transport is not available either, then it follows that the metabolite is

338

associated with reactions not included in WormPaths maps yet, which is indicated by a

339

box labeled “other”. In any case, the number of pathways and the types of transports

340

(cytosol-extracellular space or mitochondria-cytosol) a metabolite is associated with are

341

indicated by colored squares and circles, respectively, as shown by a legend appended

342

to every map. Furthermore, clicking a metabolite brings the page of that metabolite in

343

WormFlux, which shows all pathways and reactions it is associated with. Thus,

344

information about the pathway associations and transportability of, not just terminals, but

345

every metabolite in a pathway, is reachable from the pathway map.

346
347

Illustration of pathway maps

348

Draft maps were drawn as SVG files in Inkscape (http://inkscape.org) following a template

349

(S1-S2 Fig). Genes from each map were extracted from the SVG files and cross-

350

referenced to the master levels spreadsheet (S1 Tab). After correction of errors the final

351

SVG maps were wrapped with HTML format and uploaded to the WormFlux website

352

(http://wormflux.umassmed.edu). Maps were blended with WormFlux pages and made

353

interactive using PHP language for server side processes (e.g., search) and Javascripting

354

language for the client side actions (e.g., metabolite image display).

355
356

Pathway enrichment analysis

357

Pathway enrichment analysis was performed on RNA-seq data from N2 (Bristol) C.

358

elegans untreated or treated with 20 nM vitamin B12 or 20 nM vitamin B12 and 40 mM

359

propionate as described [26]. All expressed transcripts matching iCEL1314 genes were

360

defined as the population, and the respective WormPaths categories and pathways at

361

each level were defined as the number of successes in the population. All differentially

362

expressed genes with a fold change of ≥ +/- 1.5 and an adjusted P-value of ≤ 0.05 were

16

363

defined as the sample size and corresponding WormPath levels and categories were

364

defined as the number of successes in the sample. Pathway enrichment was determined

365

using the hypergeometric distribution function in Microsoft Excel (HYPGEOM.DIST) and

366

P-values ≤ 0.05 were considered enriched for a pathway or category. The results were

367

compared with those of WormCat Enrichment Analysis, where original WormCat

368

annotations for metabolic genes were used as background gene set and p-value<0.05

369

was used to define significant enrichment.

370
371

Metabolite structures

372

Out of the 907 metabolites in iCEL1314, 777 are represented in WormPaths maps by

373

abbreviations that are linked to pop-ups with metabolite name, formula and structure.

374

Names and formulas follow from iCEL1314 [3]. Structures were based on mol file

375

representations [36] or hand drawings. Mol files were readily obtained from KEGG [6] for

376

563 metabolites, and from other public resources including Virtual Metabolic Human

377

Database [37], PubChem, and ChEBI for 52 more. All mol files were converted to PNG

378

format using Open Babel [38]. The structures of 147 metabolites were created based on

379

mol files and shapes of similar molecules using a commercial vector-based graphics

380

software when necessary. These drawings were also saved as PNG. No definitive

381

structures were found for the remaining 15 metabolites (mostly proteins), which were

382

represented by enlarged letters in their formula instead of chemical structures. Finally,

383

each structure image was stacked with the corresponding metabolite name and formula

384

using Inkscape to obtain the pop-up PNG images of metabolites used in WormPaths.
