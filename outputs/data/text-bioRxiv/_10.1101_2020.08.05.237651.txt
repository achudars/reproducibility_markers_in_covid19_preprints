CoV-2). The protease inhibitor camostat mesylate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung

50

cells by blocking the virus-activating host cell protease TMPRSS2. Camostat mesylate has

51

been approved for treatment of pancreatitis in Japan and is currently being repurposed for

52

COVID-19 treatment. However, potential mechanisms of viral resistance as well as

53

camostat mesylate metabolization and antiviral activity of metabolites are unclear. Here, we

54

show that SARS-CoV-2 can employ TMPRSS2-related host cell proteases for activation and

55

that several of them are expressed in viral target cells. However, entry mediated by these

56

proteases was blocked by camostat mesylate. The camostat metabolite GBPA inhibited the

57

activity of recombinant TMPRSS2 with reduced efficiency as compared to camostat

58

mesylate and was rapidly generated in the presence of serum. Importantly, the infection

59

experiments in which camostat mesylate was identified as a SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor involved

60

preincubation of target cells with camostat mesylate in the presence of serum for 2 h and

61

thus allowed conversion of camostat mesylate into GBPA. Indeed, when the antiviral

62

activities of GBPA and camostat mesylate were compared in this setting, no major

63

differences were identified. Our results indicate that use of TMPRSS2-related proteases for

64

entry into target cells will not render SARS-CoV-2 camostat mesylate resistant. Moreover,

65

the present and previous findings suggest that the peak concentrations of GBPA established

66

after the clinically approved camostat mesylate dose (600 mg/day) will result in antiviral

67

activity.

72

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-

73

CoV-2) in the city of Wuhan, China, in the winter of 2019 and its subsequent pandemic spread

74

has resulted in more than 14 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 and more than 600.00

75

deaths (1). Antivirals designed to combat SARS-CoV-2 are not available and repurposing of

76

existing drugs developed against other diseases is considered the fastest option to close this gap

77

(2). Remdesivir, a drug generated to inhibit Ebola virus infection, has recently been shown to

78

reduce the duration of hospitalization for COVID-19 (3). However, the drug failed to reduce

79

fatality significantly (3) and beneficial effects were not observed in a previous clinical trial (4),

80

indicating that additional therapeutic options are needed.

81

We previously showed that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S) uses the host cell factors

82

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for

83

entry into target cells (5). TMPRSS2 is a cellular type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP)

84

expressed in human respiratory epithelium that cleaves and thereby activates the viral S protein.

85

Activation is essential for viral infectivity and we found that the protease inhibitor camostat

86

mesylate, which is known to block TMPRSS2 activity (6), inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of

87

lung cells (5). Camostat mesylate has been approved for treatment of pancreatitis in Japan (7-9)

88

and it is currently being investigated as a treatment of COVID-19 in several clinical trials in

89

Denmark, Israel and USA (NCT04321096, NCT04353284, NCT04355052, NCT04374019).

90

The activity of TMPRSS2 is essential for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV lung infection and

91

disease development (10, 11). Whether TMPRSS2-independent pathways for S protein activation

92

exist and contribute to viral spread outside the lung is not fully understood. The S proteins of

93

SARS-CoV-2 and several other coronaviruses can be activated by the pH-dependent endosomal

94

cysteine protease cathepsin L in certain cell lines (5, 12-15). However, this auxiliary S protein

95

activation pathway is not operative in the lung, likely due to low cathepsin L expression (16).

96

Whether this pathway contributes to the recently reported extrapulmonary spread of SARS-CoV-

97

2 is unknown (17). Similarly, it is unclear whether TTSPs other than TMPRSS2 can promote

98

extrapulmonary SARS-CoV-2 spread. Finally, camostat mesylate is rapidly hydrolyzed into the

99

active metabolite 4-(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy)phenylacetic acid (GBPA) in patients (18-20) but it

100

is unknown to what extend GBPA inhibits TMPRSS2 activity.

101

Here, we identify TTSPs other than TMPRSS2 that can be used by SARS-CoV-2 for S

102

protein activation and demonstrate that they are inhibited by camostat mesylate. Moreover, we

103

provide evidence that camostat mesylate is rapidly converted into GBPA in cell culture and that

104

GBPA inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry with almost identical efficiency as compared to camostat

105

mesylate when cells are preincubated with these compounds.

121

Identification of novel SARS-CoV-2 S protein activating proteases

122

The TTSP family comprises several enzymes which have previously been shown to activate

123

surface glycoproteins of coronaviruses and other viruses, at least upon directed expression (21-

124

23). Therefore, we asked whether the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-2-S) can employ TTSPs

125

other than TMPRSS2 for its activation. For this, we expressed different TTSPs along with the

126

SARS-CoV-2 receptor, ACE2, in the otherwise poorly susceptible BHK-21 cells, treated the cells

127

with ammonium chloride, which blocks the cathepsin L-dependent, auxiliary activation pathway,

128

and transduced the cells with previously described vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based

129

pseudotypes bearing SARS-2-S (5). Ammonium chloride treatment strongly reduced SARS-2-S-

130

driven transduction and this effect was rescued upon expression of TMPRSS2 (Fig. 1), as

131

expected. Notably, this effect was also efficiently rescued by expression of TMPRSS13 and, to a

132

lesser degree, TMPRSS11D, TMPRSS11E and TMPRSS11F (Fig. 1). Thus, SARS-2-S can use

133

diverse TTSPs for S protein activation upon overexpression, with S protein activation by

134

TMPRSS13 being particularly robust.

135
136

Several novel SARS-2-S activators are expressed in the airways and throat

137

In order to obtain insights into whether SARS-2-S activating TTSPs could contribute to viral

138

spread in the infected host, we asked whether these enzymes are expressed in viral target cells.

139

For this, we analyzed single-cell RNA-Seq datasets collected from human lungs (24) and airways

140

(25). As previously reported (26-31), ACE2 was expressed in the lung epithelial compartment,

141

particularly including alveolar type 2 cells, secretory (goblet/club) cells, and ciliated cells (Fig.

142

2A and Fig. S1). TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS13 were similarly expressed across epithelial cells,

143

although TMPRSS13 expression was generally less robust. In contrast, expression of

144

TMPRSS11-family members was only rarely detected (Fig. 2A). We found that 53% of ACE2+

145

cells in the lung co-express TMPRSS2, while 21% of ACE2+ cells do not express TMPRSS2 but

146

do express another TTSP capable of activating SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. S1). Within the airways, we

147

observed ACE2 expression in secretory cells, ciliated cells, and suprabasal cells in both the nasal

148

turbinate and the trachea (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the expression pattern of the TTSPs in the

149

airways was largely distinct: TMPRSS2 was primarily expressed in ciliated and secretory cells,

150

TMPRSS11D was primarily expressed in basal cells, TMPRSS11E was primarily expressed in

151

ionocytes, and TMPRSS13 was primarily expressed in nasal secretory cells (Fig. 2B). Within this

152

dataset, 21% of ACE2+ cells co-expressed TMPRSS2, while 24% of ACE2+ cells co-expressed a

153

different TTSP (Fig. S1). In total, these results suggest that TMPRSS2 is the dominant SARS-

154

CoV-2-activating protease in the lung, in keeping with findings made for SARS-CoV and MERS-

155

CoV, while the virus may use other activating proteases for spread in the airways.

156

A recent study provided evidence for extrapulmonary replication of SARS-CoV-2 in liver,

157

colon, heart, kidney and blood in some patients (17). Therefore, we asked whether ACE2,

158

TMPRSS2 and related SARS-2-S-activating proteases are expressed in these organs, using

159

published resources (32, 33). Liver, colon, heart and kidney expressed robust levels of ACE2

160

(Fig. 2C). Similarly, TMPRSS2 expression in colon, liver and kidney was readily detectable,

161

although expression levels were lower than those measured for lung (Fig. 2C). In contrast, little

162

to no expression of TMPRSS11D, TMPRSS11E, TMPRSS11F, TMPRSS13 was detected in

163

liver, colon, heart and kidney. Finally, TMPRSS13 was expressed in lung and blood cells and

164

expression of TMPRSS11-family members was readily detectable in esophagus and salivary

165

gland (Fig. 2C). Collectively, the TTSPs able to activate SARS-2-S were not expressed in

166

appreciable levels in potential extrapulmonary targets of SARS-CoV-2. The only exceptions were

TMPRS13 and TMPRSS11-family members that might contribute to SARS-CoV-2 infection of

168

blood cells and to viral spread in the throat, respectively.

169
170

Newly identified SARS-2-S activators are camostat mesylate sensitive

171

We next asked whether S protein activation by TTSP other than TMPRSS2 can be inhibited by

172

camostat mesylate. To address this question, we performed the rescue assay as described above

173

but investigated whether rescue can be blocked by camostat mesylate. In the absence of TTSP

174

expression in target cells, ammonium chloride but not camostat mesylate reduced SARS-2-S-

175

driven entry and the combination of both substances resulted in similar inhibition as observed

176

upon ammonium chloride treatment alone (Fig. 3). These results are in agreement with only the

177

cathepsin L-dependent auxiliary pathway being operative in control BHK-21 cells, in agreement

178

with our published results (5). In TMPRSS2 transfected cells ammonium chloride did not

179

efficiently block entry (Fig. 3), since under those conditions TMPRSS2 is available for S protein

180

activation. Similarly, no entry inhibition was observed upon blockade of TMPRSS2 activity by

181

camostat mesylate (Fig. 3), since the cathepsin L dependent activation pathway remained

182

operative. Finally, the combination of ammonium chloride and camostat mesylate blocked entry

183

into these cells (Fig. 3), in keeping with both activation pathways (cathepsin L and TMPRSS2)

184

not being available under these conditions. Importantly, a comparable inhibition pattern was

185

observed for all TTSPs able to activate SARS-2-S (Fig. 3), demonstrating that camostat mesylate

186

will likely suppress SARS-CoV-2 activation by TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS2-related S protein

187

activating serine proteases.

191

Multiple studies show that camostat mesylate is rapidly converted into its active metabolite, 4-(4-

192

guanidinobenzoyloxy)phenylacetic acid (GBPA) in animals and humans, followed by further

193

conversion of GBPA into the inactive metabolite 4-guanidinobenzoic acid (GBA) (18-20, 34)

194

(Fig. 6A). However, the capacity of GBPA to inhibit the enzymatic activity of TMPRSS2 has not

195

been examined. To address this question, we compared inhibition of recombinant TMPRSS2 by

196

camostat mesylate, GBPA and GBA. For this, we used FOY-251, a methanesulfonate of GBPA.

197

We found that FOY-251 exerted a 10-fold reduced capacity to inhibit TMPRSS2 as compared to

198

camostat mesylate, although both compounds completely suppressed TMPRSS2 activity at 1 µM

199

or higher (Fig. 4). In contrast, GBA was less active (Fig. 4). Thus, FOY-251 blocks TMPRSS2

200

activity but with reduced efficiency as compared to camostat mesylate.

201

In order to obtain insights into the reduced inhibitor activity of FOY-251, we investigated

202

TMPRSS2 inhibition by GBPA on the molecular level. For this, we used a combination of

203

extensive all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Markov modeling of the

204

TMPRSS2-GBPA complex (35). Guanidinobenzoate-containing drugs such as camostat mesylate

205

and GBPA inhibit TMPRSS2 by first forming a noncovalent precomplex which is then catalyzed

206

to form a long-lived covalent complex that is the main source of inhibition (36). However, the

207

population of the short-lived precomplex directly relates to the inhibitory activity (35). By

208

computing the TMPRSS2-GBPA binding kinetics (35), we find that (i) the noncovalent

209

TMPRSS2-GBPA complex is metastable, rendering it suitable to form a covalent inhibitory

210

complex, and (ii) its population is 40% lower compared to camostat at equal drug concentrations,

211

consistent with the finding that FOY-251 is a viable but less potent inhibitor (Fig. 4).

212

Structurally, we find that GBPA binds in the same manner as camostat (Fig. 5, (35)). The main

213

stabilizing interaction is its Guanidinium group binding into TMPRSS2’s S1 pocket which is

214

stabilized by a transient salt bridge with Asp 435. The GBPA ester group can interact with the

215

catalytic Ser 441, making it prone for catalysis and formation of the catalytic complex. The

216

slightly lower stability of the GBPA compared to the camostat mesylate-TMPRSS2 complex is

217

consistent with GBPA’s shorter tail which has less possibilities to interact with the hydrophobic

218

patch on the TMPRSS2 binding site shown in Fig. 5, left panel.

219
220

Rapid conversion of camostat mesylate to GBPA in cell culture

221

Although camostat mesylate is rapidly metabolized in animals and humans, it is less clear

222

whether conversion of camostat mesylate into GBPA and GBA also occurs in cell culture. We

223

addressed this question by exposing camostat mesylate to culture medium containing fetal calf

224

serum (FCS), which is standardly used for cell culture, followed by mass spectrometric

225

quantification of camostat mesylate and GBPA levels. Camostat mesylate levels rapidly declined

226

with a half-life of approximately 2 h and the compound being barely detectable after 8 h (Fig.

227

6B). Conversely, the levels of the camostat mesylate metabolite GBPA increased rapidly, with

228

peak levels attained at 8 h, and then remained relatively stable (Fig. 6B). Finally, the rapid

229

metabolization of camostat mesylate into GBPA in the presence of serum was further confirmed

230

by incubation of camostat mesylate in either water or FCS-containing culture medium for 1 min

231

followed by quantification of camostat mesylate and GBPA levels. While GBPA levels were at

232

background level when camostat mesylate was incubated in water, ~5.4 % of camostat mesylate

233

was metabolized into GBPA when incubated in FCS-containing culture medium (Fig. 6C). Thus,

234

camostat mesylate is rapidly converted into GBPA under standard cell culture conditions, but the

235

conversion is slower than what is observed in humans (20).

236
237

Camostat mesylate and FOY-251 inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection with comparable efficiency

238

We finally compared the antiviral activity of camostat mesylate and FOY-251, the

239

methanesulfonate of GBPA, in cell culture. The reduced ability of FOY-251 to block the

240

enzymatic activity of recombinant TMPRSS2 as compared to camostat mesylate would suggest

241

that the compound should also exert reduced antiviral activity. On the other hand, analysis of

242

antiviral activity encompasses preincubation of target cells with camostat mesylate for 2 h in the

243

presence of FCS, which allows conversion of camostat mesylate into GBPA, as demonstrated

244

above. Indeed, titration experiments with VSV pseudotypes and Calu-3 lung cells as targets

245

revealed that entry inhibition by FOY-251 was only slightly reduced as compared to camostat

246

mesylate, with EC50 values of 107 nM (camostat mesylate) and 178 nM (FOY-251) (Fig. 7).

247

Moreover, no marked differences in inhibition of infection of Calu-3 cells with authentic SARS-

248

CoV-2 were observed (Fig. 8). Thus, under the conditions chosen camostat mesylate and GBPA

249

exerted comparable antiviral activity, likely due to conversion of camostat mesylate into GBPA.

DISCUSSION

264

With the exception of remdesivir, which reduces disease duration (3), and dexamethasone, which

265

reduces mortality in ICU patients by targeting inflammation (37), there are currently no drugs

266

against COVID-19 with efficacy proven in clinical trials. We previously reported that the

267

protease inhibitor camostat mesylate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of cultured lung cells by

268

blocking the virus-activating cellular protease TMPRSS2 (5). Camostat mesylate has been

269

approved for human use in Japan and may thus constitute a COVID-19 treatment option. Here,

270

we provide evidence that the virus can use TMPRSS2-related proteases for S protein activation

271

and that these enzymes are also blocked by camostat mesylate. Moreover, we demonstrate that

272

the camostat mesylate metabolite GBPA exhibits reduced ability to block enzymatic activity of

273

purified, recombinant TMPRSS2 and is rapidly produced under cell culture conditions. The rapid

274

conversion of camostat mesylate into GBPA likely accounts for our finding that both compounds

275

exerted similar antiviral activity.

276

Knock-out of TMPRSS2 in mice markedly reduces SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection

277

(10) and disease development, and similar findings have been reported for influenza A viruses

278

(IAV) (38-40), which also use TMPRSS2 for glycoprotein activation (41). Thus, TMPRSS2

279

activity is essential for CoV and IAV infection of the lung. In contrast, several members of the

280

TTSP family other than TMPRSS2 can activate CoV and IAV glycoproteins and support viral

281

spread in cell culture, at least upon directed expression (21, 23, 41). Whether these TTSPs play a

282

role in viral spread in the host is incompletely understood. For IAV, infection by H3N2 viruses

283

were found not to be fully TMPRSS2 dependent (38, 42) and an auxiliary role of TMPRSS4 in

284

spread and pathogenesis of H3N2 viruses has been reported (43, 44). Moreover, influenza B

285

viruses can use a broad range of TTSPs in cell culture (44, 45) and a prominent role of TMPRSS2

286

in viral spread in type II pneumocytes has been reported (46) but viral spread in mice is

287

TMPRSS2 independent (44, 47).

288

The present study shows that also SARS-CoV-2 can use TTSPs other than TMPRSS2 for

289

S protein activation. Whether the TTSPs found here to activate SARS-2-S upon directed

290

expression play a role in viral spread in the host remains to be investigated. Expression analyses

291

suggest that they may. TMPRSS13 activated SARS-2-S with similar efficiency as TMPRSS2 and

292

TMPRSS13 mRNA was found to be coexpressed with ACE2 in type II pneumocytes, goblet and

293

club cells and basal cells. Moreover, TMPRSS13 was expressed in blood cells, which may

294

constitute a target for SARS-CoV-2 infection in some patients. Finally, and most notably, SARS-

295

S-2 activating TTSPs showed distinct expression patterns in the upper respiratory tract and

296

several potential target cells coexpressed ACE2 jointly with a novel S protein activating TTSP

297

but not TMPRSS2. Although viral spread supported by TMPRSS13 and potentially other SARS-

298

2-S activating TTSPs could contribute to transmission and pathogenesis, it would still be

299

sensitive to blockade by camostat mesylate. Thus, usage of auxiliary TTSPs for S protein

300

activation would not confer camostat mesylate resistance to SARS-CoV-2.

301

In animal and humans camostat mesylate is rapidly hydrolyzed into the active metabolite

302

4-(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy) phenylacetic acid (GBPA), which is further hydrolyzed to 4-

303

guanidinobenzoic acid (GBA) (18-20). GBPA was known to retain protease inhibitor activity (34,

304

48) but it was unclear whether GBPA would block TMPRSS2 activity with the same efficiency

305

as camostat mesylate. Inhibition studies carried out with recombinant TMPRSS2 demonstrated

306

that although GBPA robustly blocked TMPRSS2 activity, the compound was about 10-fold less

307

active than camostat mesylate, which roughly matches results reported for other proteases (49).

308

This finding raised the question whether camostat mesylate conversion into GBPA also occurs in

309

cell culture systems used to assess antiviral activity of camostat mesylate. Indeed, camostat

310

mesylate was rapidly converted into GBPA in the presence of serum which may account for

311

camostat mesylate and FOY-251 exerting roughly comparable antiviral activity when cells were

312

preincubated with these compounds for 2 h in the presence of serum. This has important

313

implications for COVID-19 treatment, considering that continuous IV infusion of camostat

314

mesylate (40 mg) resulted in a maximal plasma GBPA concentration of 0.22 µM and peak

315

plasma concentrations of GBPA in humans upon oral intake of 200 mg camostat mesylate can

316

reach 0.25 µM (http://www.shijiebiaopin.net/upload/product/201272318373223.PDF). Provided

317

that concentrations in plasma and in respiratory epithelium are comparable, this would suggest

318

that GBPA peak levels attained with the dosage approved for pancreatitis treatment (200 mg

319

camostat mesylate three times a day) would be sufficient to exert antiviral activity.

320

Collectively, our results indicate that camostat mesylate constitutes a viable treatment

321

option for COVID-19. Independent of its antiviral activity, camostat mesylate might reduce the

322

uncontrolled cytokine release observed in severe COVID-19, since TMPRSS2 expression is

323

required for robust cytokine release upon exposure of mice to polyIC (10).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

335
336

Cell culture

337

BHK-21 (baby hamster kidney; ATCC no. CCL-10) and HEK-293T (human embryonic kidney;

338

DSMZ no. ACC 635) cells were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium supplemented

339

with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FCS, Biochrom), 100 U/mL of penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL of

340

streptomycin (PAN-Biotech). Calu-3 cells (human lung adenocarcinoma) were cultivated in

341

minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 10 % FCS (Biochrom), 100 U/mL of penicillin

342

and 0.1 mg/mL of streptomycin (PAN-Biotech), 1x non-essential amino acid solution (from 100x

343

stock, PAA) and 10mM sodium pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cell lines were incubated at

344

37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % CO2. Transfection of 293T cells was performed

345

by calcium-phosphate precipitation, while Lipofectamine LTX with Plus reagent (Thermo Fisher

346

Scientific) was used for transfection of BHK-21 cells.

347
348

Plasmids

349

We employed pCAGGS-based expression vectors for VSV-G, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS3,

350

TMPRSS4, TMPRSS10, TMPRSS11A, TMPRSS11B, TMPRSS11D, TMPRSS11E,

351

TMPRSS11F and TMPRSS13 that have either been previously described elsewhere or

352

constructed on existing expression vectors (21-23, 50-52). All proteases contained an N-terminal

353

cMYC-epitope tag. Further, we used pCG1-based expression vectors for human ACE2 (53) and a

354

SARS-2-S variant with a truncated cytoplasmic tail for improved pseudotype particle production

355

(deletion of last 18 amino acid residues,(54))

358

Camostat mesylate and GBPA were obtained from Ono pharmaceuticals Co., LTD.

359

(Osaka/Japan) and reconstituted in DMSO to yield stock solutions of 100 mM. Stocks were

360

stored at -20 °C, thawed immediately before the experiment and residual compound was

361

discarded.

362
363

Mass spectrometric quantification of camostat mesylate metabolization

364

Camostat mesylate was diluted to a concentration of ~15 µM in either water or MEM containing

365

10 % FCS and incubated for 1 min (water and medium samples), 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8

366

h and 24 h (only medium samples) at 37 °C. Next, samples were snap-frozen and stored at -80 °C

367

until camostat mesylate, GBPA and GBA levels were quantified by mass spectrometry. An ultra-

368

high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method using pneumatically

369

assisted electrospray ionisation (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) was used for quantification of camostat

370

and 4-(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy) phenylacetic acid (GBPA) in liquid samples. Calibrants based

371

on blank sample were used for the construction of 8-point calibration curves. Calibrants were

372

prepared with concentrations of 0.1, 1, 25, 50, 75, 100, 500 and 1000 µg/L of camostat and

373

GBPA. In addition, a blank sample (a processed matrix sample without any added analyte) and a

374

blank sample spiked with SIL-IS were included to verify the absence of detectable concentrations

375

of the analytes. The calibration curves were created by weighted (1/x) regression analysis of the

376

SIL-IS normalised peak areas (analyte area/IS area).

377
378

Preparation of pseudotype particles

379

We employed a previously published protocol to generate vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)

380

pseudotype particles that is based on a replication-deficient VSV containing eGFP and firefly

381

luciferase (FLuc) reporter genes, VSV*ΔG-FLuc (kindly provided by Gert Zimmer, Institute of

382

Virology and Immunology IVI, Mittelhäusern/Switzerland) (5, 55). For this, HEK-293T cells

383

were first transfected with expression vector for either SARS-2-S or VSV-G (or empty

384

expression vector, control). At 24 h post transfection, cells were inoculated with VSV-G-

385

transcomplemented VSV*ΔG-FLuc at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3 and incubated for 1

386

h at 37 °C and 5 % CO2. Next, the inoculum was removed and cells were washed with PBS

387

before fresh culture medium was added. In case of cells transfected with SARS-2-S-encoding

388

vector or empty plasmid, the medium was spiked with anti-VSV-G antibody (supernatant of

389

CRL-2700 cells, 1:1,000) in order to inactivate residual input virus containing VSV-G. At 16-18

390

h post inoculation, the culture supernatant was harvested and centrifuged (2,000 x g, 10 min) to

391

remove cellular debris. Clarified supernatants containing pseudotype particles were aliquoted and

392

stored at -80 °C until further use.

393
394

Preparation of TMPRSS2 recombinant protein and substrate

395

Human TMPRSS2 (Recombinant N-terminus 6xHis, aa106-492) (Cat # LS-G57269-20) protein

396

was acquired from LifeSpan Biosciences. Peptide Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-MCA for the enzyme

397

substrate was acquired from Peptide Institute, Inc.

398
399

TMPRSS2 enzyme assay

400

All of different concentrations of test compounds were dissolved in DMSO and diluted with

401

assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 154 mM NaCl) to the final DMSO concentration of 1%.

402

Compound solution and Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-MCA (10 μM final concentration) were added into the

403

384-well black plate (Greiner 784076). Then, enzyme reaction was started after adding

404

TMPRSS2 recombinant protein to a final concentration of 2 μg/mL. Fluorescence intensity was

405

read using the Envision plate reader with excitation: 380 nm and emission: 460 nm in 2 min

406

intervals over 60 min at room temperature. The IC50 value was calculated based on the increasing

407

rate of fluorescence intensity.

408
409

Molecular dynamics simulations and Markov modeling

410

We used extensive all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of TMPRSS2 in complex

411

with camostat as described in (35) starting from a homology model (56), in which drug binding

412

and dissociation are sampled multiple times. We have then replaced camostat with GBPA and

413

simulated a total of 50 µs MD with the same simulation setup as in [1] and used Markov

414

modeling (57) to extract the dominant metastable binding modes of GBPA to the TMPRSS2

415

target on an atomistic scale. We estimate the binding kinetics of GBPA to the non-covalent

416

complex by re-estimating the camostat Markov model described in (35) with the TMPRSS2-

417

GBPA data. At the simulated drug concentration the association constant of GBPA is found to

418

have a maximum likelihood estimate of 60% compared to that of camostat, resulting in a

419

correspondingly lower inhibitory activity following the kinetic model of (35). Bootstrapping of

420

trajectories under the constraint of comparable implied timescales yields a confidence interval of

421

51-100 % (68 % percentile).

422
423

Transduction experiments

424

The day before transduction, BHK-21 cells were transfected with an expression vector for ACE2

425

and either empty expression plasmid (control) or expression vector encoding TMPRSS2,

426

TMPRSS3, TMPRSS4, TMPRSS10, TMPRSS11A, TMPRSS11B, TMPRSS11D, TMPRSS11E,

427

TMPRSS11F or TMPRSS13. For this, the old culture medium was removed and 50 µl/well of

428

fresh culture medium were added. Next, transfection mixtures were prepared. For one well 0.1 µg

429

of ACE2-encoding vector and 0.02 µg of protease-encoding vector (or empty plasmid) were

430

mixed with 1 µl of Plus reagent, 50 µl of Opti-MEM medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1 µl

431

of Lipofectamine LTX reagent. The transfection mix was vortexed and incubated for 30 min at

432

room temperature before it was added to the cells. At 6 h post transfection, the transfection

433

medium was replaced by fresh culture medium and the cells were further incubated for ~18 h.

434

Then, the cells were either pre-incubated for 2 h with inhibitor (50 mM ammonium chloride

435

[Sigma-Aldrich], 100 µM camostat mesylate or a combination of both; cell treated with DMSO

436

served as controls) before transduction or directly inoculated with pseudotype particles bearing

437

SARS-2-S or cells. For transduction of Calu-3 cells, cells were pre-incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and

438

5 % CO2 with different concentrations (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 µM) of camostat mesylate, FOY-251

439

or DMSO (control), before they were inoculated with pseudotype particles bearing SARS-2-S or

440

VSV-G. At 16 h post inoculation, transduction efficiency was analyzed by measuring the activity

441

of virus-encoded FLuc in cell lysates. For this, the cell culture medium was removed and cells

442

were incubated for 30 min with 1x concentrated Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega), before

443

cell lysates were transferred into white opaque-walled 96-well plates and luminescence was

444

recorded (1 sec/sample) using a Hidex Sense plate luminometer (Hidex) and a commercial

445

substrate (Beetle-Juice, PJK).

446
447

Analysis of cell vitality

448

For the analysis of cell vitality of Calu-3 cells treated with camostat mesylate or FOY-251 the

449

CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega) was used. For this, Calu-3 cells

450

were grown in 96-well plates to reach ~50% confluency, before they were incubated in the

451

presence of different concentrations of camostat mesylate or FOY-251 for 24 h. Cells treated with

452

DMSO (solvent control) served as controls. Following incubation, 100 µl of CellTiter-Glo

453

substrate were added per well and the samples were incubated for 30 min on a rocking platform.

454

In addition, fresh culture medium (without cells) was also incubated with CellTiter-Glo substrate

455

in order to define the assay background. Following incubation, the samples were transferred into

456

white opaque-walled 96-well plates and luminescence was recorded (200 msec/sample) using a

457

Hidex Sense plate luminometer (Hidex).

458
459

Infection of Calu-3 cells with authentic SARS-CoV-2

460

The SARS-CoV-2 isolate hCoV-19/Germany/FI1103201/2020 (GISAID accession EPI-

461

ISL_463008) was isolated at the Institute of Virology, Muenster, Germany, from a patient

462

returning from the Southern Tyrolean ski areas and propagated in Vero-TMPRSS2 cells. Calu-3

463

cells were pre-incubated for 2 h with 2-fold concentrated camostat mesylate or FOY-251 (2, 20

464

or 200 µM), or DMSO (control), before they were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of

465

0.001 or 0.01. For this, the identical volume of virus-containing medium was added to the

466

inhibitor-containing medium on the cells (resulting in 1-fold concentrated camostat mesylate or

467

FOY-251; 1, 10 or 100 µM). Following 1 h of incubation at 37 °C and 5 % CO2, the culture

468

supernatant was removed and cells were washed two times with excess PBS before culture

469

medium containing 1-fold concentrated inhibitor was added. Supernatants were harvested at 24 h

470

post inoculation and subjected to plaque titration. For this, confluent Vero-TMPRSS2 cells were

471

inoculated with 10-fold serial dilutions of supernatant and incubated for 1 h 37 °C and 5 % CO2.

472

Thereafter, the inoculum was removed and cells were incubated with culture medium containing

473

1 % (w/v) methyl cellulose. Plaques were counted at 48 h post infection and titers determined as

474

plaque forming units per ml (pfu/ml).

477

Bulk tissue expression data were obtained from the GTEx portal (33). Single-cell expression data

478

from human lungs were obtained from GSE1229603. Only IPF and cryobiopsy lung explants

479

were used in this analysis. Single-cell expression data from human airways was obtained from

480

https://www.genomique.eu/cellbrowser/HCA/4. The single-cell data was analyzed as described in

481

Smith et al (29). In short, dimensionality reduction and clustering were performed on normalized

482

expression data in python using Scanpy and the Multicore-TSNE package (58, 59). Low quality

483

cells were filtered out by removing cells with fewer than 500 detected genes. Highly variable

484

genes were computed using the Seurat approach in Scanpy, and then used to calculate the

485

principle component analysis. T-SNE and Leiden clustering were calculated using nearest

486

neighbors, with parameters as described in the associated code. Cell clusters were labeled

487

manually by comparing the expression patterns of established marker genes with the lists of

488

differentially-expressed genes produced by Scanpy (60-63). The code used for performing these

489

analyses is available at https://github.com/joan-smith/covid19-proteases/.

490
491

Statistical analyses

492

All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (version 8.4.2, GraphPad Software,

493

Inc.). Statistical significance of differences between two datasets was analyzed by paired, two-

494

tailed student’s t-test, while two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’s posttest was

495

used for comparison of multiple datasets (the exact method used is stated in the figure legends).

496

For the calculation of the turnover time required for metabolization of 50 % of camostat mesylate

497

(T1/2) as well as the effective concentration 50 (EC50) values, which indicate the inhibitor

498

concentration leading to 50 % reduction of transduction, non-linear fit regression models were

499

used.

Fig. 1. Different TTSPs can activate SARS-2-S in transfected cells. BHK-21 cells transiently

728

expressing ACE2 and one of the indicated type-II transmembrane serine protease (or empty

729

vector) were pre-incubated with either 50 mM ammonium chloride or DMSO (control, indicated

730

by dashed line) for 2 h, before they were inoculated with pseudotype particles bearing SARS-2-S.

731

At 16 h post inoculation, SARS-2-S-driven cell entry of viral pseudotypes was analyzed by

732

measuring the activity of virus-encoded luciferase activity in cell lysates. Data were further

733

normalized and entry efficiency in the absence of ammonium chloride was set as 100 %. Shown

734

are the average (mean) data obtained from three biological replicates, each performed in

735

quadruplicates. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical significance

736

of differences in entry efficiency in the presence of ammonium chloride was analyzed by two-

750

modifications that only TMPRSS2, TMPRSS11D, TMPRSS11E, TMPRSS11F and TMPRSS13

751

were investigated and target cells were pre-treated with either 50 mM ammonium chloride (red),

752

100 µM camostat mesylate (blue) or a combination of both (green). DMSO-treated cells served

753

as controls. At 16 h post inoculation with viral particles bearing SARS-2-S, pseudotype entry was

754

analyzed by measuring the activity of virus-encoded luciferase activity in cell lysates. Data were

785

1, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480, and 1,440 min at 37 °C, snap-frozen and stored at -80 °C. Samples

Fig. 7. Camostat mesylate and FOY-251 inhibit SARS-2-S-driven cell entry with

802

comparable efficiency. Calu-3 cells were pre-incubated with different concentrations of

803

camostat mesylate (left panel), FOY-251 (right panel) or DMSO (control, indicated by dashed

804

lines) for 2 h, before they were inoculated with pseudotype particles bearing VSV-G (red) or

805

SARS-2-S (blue). Alternatively, in order to analyze potential negative effects of camostat

806

mesylate and FOY-251 on cell vitality (grey bars), cells received medium instead of pseudotype

807

particles and were further incubated. At 16 h post inoculation, pseudotype entry and cell vitality

808

were analyzed by measuring the activity of virus-encoded luciferase activity in cell lysates or

809

intracellular adenosine triphosphate levels (CellTiter-Glo assay), respectively. Data were further

810

normalized against and entry efficiency/cell vitality in the absence of camostat mesylate and

811

FOY-251 was set as 100 %. Shown are the average (mean) data obtained from three biological

812

replicates, each performed in quadruplicates. Error bars indicate SEM. Statistical significance of

813

differences in entry efficiency/cell vitality in camostat mesylate - or FOY-251-treated cells versus

814

control-treated cells was analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s posttest (p > 0.5, not

815

significant [ns], p ≤ 0.5, *; p ≤ 0.1, **; p ≤ 0.01, ***).

mesylate or FOY-251 as indicated. DMSO-treated cells served as control. Thereafter, cells were

820

infected with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI 0.001 or MOI 0.01 by adding the same volume of virus-

821

containing culture medium to the inhibitor-treated cells. After 1 h of incubation, the inoculum

822

was removed and cells were washed two times with PBS, before culture medium containing 1-

823

fold inhibitor concentration was added. Culture supernatants were harvested at 24 h post

824

infection, stored at -80°C and thereafter subjected to standard plaque formation assays using

825

Vero-TMPRSS2 target cells and culture medium containing 1 % methyl cellulose. Plaques were

826

counted at 48 h post infection and titers determined as plaque forming units per ml (pfu/ml).

827

Presented are the data from a single experiment performed with technical triplicates and the

828

results were confirmed in a separate experiment with another SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Error bars

829

indicate the standard deviation.
