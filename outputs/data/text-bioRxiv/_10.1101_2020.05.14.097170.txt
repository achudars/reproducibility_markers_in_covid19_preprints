Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus that has caused more than 0.29 million deaths worldwide
as of May 2020, and influence of COVID-19 pandemic is increasing continuously in the absence of
approved vaccine and drug. Moreover, very limited information is available about SARS-CoV-2
expressed regions and immune responses. In this paper an effort has been made, to facilitate vaccine
development by proposing multiple epitopes as potential vaccine candidates by utilising SARS-CoV-2
transcriptome data. Here, publicly available RNA-seq data of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHBE and
A549 human cell lines were used to construct SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome to understand disease
pathogenesis and immune responses. In the first step, epitope prediction, MHC class I and II gene
identification for epitopes, population coverage, antigenicity, immunogenicity, conservation and crossreactivity analysis with host antigens were performed by using SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome, and in the
second step, structural compatibility of identified T-and B-cell epitopes were evaluated with MHC
molecules and B-cell receptors through molecular docking studies. Quantification of MHC gene
expression was also performed that indicated high variation in allele types and expression level of MHC
genes with respect to cell lines. In A549 cell line, HLA-A*30:01:01:01 and HLA-B*44:03:01:01 were
highly expressed, whereas 92 variants of HLA-A*24 genes such as HLA-A*24:02:01:01, HLAA*24:286, HLA-A*24:479Q, HLA-A*24:02:134 and HLA-A*24:02:116 were highly expressed in
NHBE cell lines. Prevalence of HLA-A*24 alleles was suggested as risk factors for H1N1 infection,
and associated with type-1 diabetes. HLA-C*03:03, linked with male infertility factors was also highly
expressed in SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE cell lines. Finally, three potential T-cell and five B-cell
epitopes were selected for molecular docking studies with twenty-two MHC molecules and two B-cell
receptors respectively. The results of in silico analysis indicated that proposed epitopes have high
potential to recognize immune response of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study will facilitate in vitro
and in vivo vaccine related research studies.

1. Introduction
Corona viruses are a group of related viruses that are responsible for causing diseases ranging from the
common cold to severe diseases like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), SARS-CoV-2 in
mammals and birds. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the
family Coronaviridae and subgenus Sarbecovirus. It is responsible for the widespread global pandemic
causing an upper respiratory tract infection of humans [1]. SARS-CoV-2 virion ranges from
approximately 50-200 nm in diameter [2]. SARS-CoV-2 is made up of four structural proteins known
as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane) and N (nucleocapsid) proteins. The nucleocapsid protein
contains the viral RNA and the spike, membrane, envelope make up the viral envelope. The spike
protein is responsible for the viral attachment with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors
and facilitates entry into the host cells [3]. The ACE2 receptors are present in the goblet (secretory)
cells of ciliated cells in the nose, back of the throat, lungs, gut, heart muscles and kidney which
facilitates the hand to mouth transmission route. The viral RNA is released in the nasal cells when the
transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) splits the spike proteins, and enters inside the cell, the
viral genetic material replicates into millions. Seroconversion of SARS-CoV-2 took place within four
days of infection and was found in most patients by day 14 and persistent specific IgG and antibody
production was reported even after 2 years of infection [4]. Whereas limited serological details of
SARS-CoV-2 are available at the moment, it is reported that a patient showed the presence of IgM after
9 days of infection, and later production of IgG after 2 weeks [5]. In an in vitro plaque testing with
patient sera, it was confirmed that it is able to neutralize SARS-CoV highlighting the successful
mounting of humoral response [6]. The current evidences have shown that Th1 immune response can
be successful for controlling SARS-CoV and may work for SARS-CoV-2 as well, since the epitopes
overlap for both, the T-epitopes can be identified and will be valuable for designing the cross-reactive
vaccines.
Epitopes are the antigenic regions of an antigen, causing an immune response which is identified by
antibodies generated from T-and B-cells. T-cell epitopes present on the cell surface binds to the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. The MHC I molecules presents peptides of 8-11 amino
acids in length, which are CD8+ T-cell epitopes. In contrast, MHC II molecules present longer peptides
of 13-17 amino acids in length, which are CD4+ T-cell epitopes. The epitope-based vaccine
development offers prospective advantages over the whole protein approach because the immune
response against highly reserved epitopes over a widespread population can be used for the treatment
of highly variable pathogens [7, 8]. Various successful studies were reported for the epitope-based
vaccine design against West Nile virus [9], dengue virus [10], chikungunya virus [11], shigellosis [12]
etc. COVID-19 first cases were observed in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which seems to be the
origin of SARS-CoV-2 virus. As of April 2020, there are more than 3.04 million confirmed cases, with
211 thousand deaths globally. Vaccines and commercial detection kits are mostly in the developmental
stages to combat this viral infection, and currently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine drugs are being

used for treatment, but there is no approved drug or vaccine triggering the immune response in the body
against SARS-CoV-2 in the market.
In the present study, an integrated bioinformatics approach was used to identify expressed T- and Bcell epitopes from RNA-seq data of SARS-CoV-2 infection in normal human bronchial epithelial
(NHBE) and human adeno carcinomic alveolar basal epithelial (A549). To the best of our knowledge,
no previous study has been reported a list of expressed T-and B-cell epitopes for multi-epitope based
vaccine development. The specific objectives of this research study were: (1) SARS-CoV-2
transcriptome construction and annotation to explore expressed region of SARS-CoV-2 genome, (2)
identification of potential T-and B-cell epitopes by using SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome, (3) modelling
and docking studies to explore structural compatibility of epitopes with MHC complexes and B-cell
receptors, and (4) gene expression of MHC class I and II genes by using RNA-seq data.
2. Material and Method
2.1. SARS-CoV-2 data retrieval, processing and transcriptome assembly
Due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, several countries were started to generate molecular
resources to understand pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. We used publicly available transcriptome
data (PRJNA615032) of SARS-CoV-2 infection in A549 and NHBE cell lines [13]. All the available
data were download from the sequence read archive of NCBI database and fastq-dump program of
SRAtoolkit [14] was used to extract fastq reads. Quality assessment and control of RNA-seq data was
performed through the FastQC version 0.11.5 [15], MultiQC version 1.8 [16] and trimmomatic version
0.39 software [17]. All high-quality reads were mapped over SARS-CoV-2 isolate Wuhan-Hu1(MN908947.3) by using HISAT2 version 2.1.0 on default parameters [18]. Samtools version 1.1.0
[19] and Bedtools version 2.26.0 [20] were used to extract all the mapped read from each sample and
extracted reads were used to construct de novo assemblies by using the Trinity assembler version 2.5.1
[21]. TransDecoder program [22] was used to generate protein sequence from assembled transcriptome.
Kallisto, a pseudo aligner for bulk RNA-seq data alignment, was used for expression quantification
[23].
2.2. T-Cell epitope prediction from SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome sequences
T-cell epitopes are short peptide fragments of infectious agents such as viruses and bacteria, which has
potential to induce specific immune responses and can be used as a key molecular resource for epitopebased vaccine design. NetCTL 1.2 program [24] was used to predict cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)
epitopes from protein sequences, translated from assembled SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome. NetCTL 1.2
has 12 super types i.e. A1, A2, A3, A24, A26, B7, B8, B27, B39, B44, B58, and B62, and combined
score of proteasomal C terminal cleavage for CD8+ T-cell epitopes, MHC class I binding, and TAP
transport efficiency was considered for epitope identification at threshold value 1.00. To explore
antigenic potential of identified peptides, VaxiJen v2.0 [25] server was used at threshold value 0.4, and
IEDB program (http://tools.iedb.org/immunogenicity/) was used to identify immunogenicity score for
each identified epitopes. Combination of antigenicity and immunogenicity was used to select highly

antigenic and immunogenic peptide for further analysis. To explore MHC genes and alleles, all the
identified epitopes were analysed through IEDB program mhci (http://tools.iedb.org/mhci/download/)
and mhcii (http://tools.iedb.org/mhcii/download/). Peptide length of predicted epitopes 9.0 and
inhibitory concentration (IC50) value less than or equal to 200nM were selected as parameters for the
identification of MHC class I and II binding genes and alleles. Conservation level of selected epitopes
were calculated from IEDB program conservancy (http://tools.iedb.org/conservancy/) by using
transcriptome sequences, and publically available SARS-CoV-2 protein sequences. IEDB population
coverage tool (http://tools.iedb.org/population/) was used to analyze population coverage through
predicted MHC alleles of epitopes [26, 27]. Peptide toxicity prediction was performed through the
ToxinPred web server [28]. Cross-reactivity with host antigenic proteins might leads to adverse immune
responses. Therefore, selected epitopes were checked for similarities with the human proteome
sequences (Homo sapiens: GRCh38) through standalone NCBI BLAST similarity search tool.
2.3. B-cell epitopes prediction from SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome sequences
Sequence and structure based approaches were used to identify B-cell epitopes. In the sequence based
approach, VaxiJen server was used to identify most antigenic proteins from translated transcriptome,
and BepiPred-2.0 program [29] was used to identify B-cell epitopes from the identified antigenic
proteins. IEDB conformational B-cell prediction tool ElliPro (http://tools.iedb.org/ellipro/) was used to
predict epitopes based on protein structure with the parameters PI (protrusion index) value 0.8 as
minimum score, and 7 Å as maximum distance [30]. Protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome
were showed strong sequence similarity with modelled 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 genome at Zhang
lab. Hence, we downloaded 24 structure

of SARS-CoV-2 genome

from Zhang lab

(https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/) for structure-based epitope prediction. Epitopes identified by
both the approaches were evaluated for toxicity, antigenicity, and immunogenicity same as done for Tcell epitopes. Cross-reactivity of selected epitopes were checked with human proteome sequences.
2.4. Molecular docking studies
Selected epitopes were used for structural compatibility and interaction analysis with available MHC
class I and II genes, and B-cell receptor structures. Protein structure of MHC class genes, and B-cell
receptors were retrieved from RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB) (https://www.rcsb.org/) in PDB format.
To identify the interactions between predicted T- and B- cell epitopes and protein receptors, the
molecular docking studies were performed using AutoDockTools, AutoDock Vina and CABS-dock
server [31-33]. Structural compatibility and interaction prediction between peptide and receptor in real
world is even more complex and challenging. Therefore, initial screening of peptides for receptors were
performed through Autodock, whereas CABSdocks, considered full flexibility of peptide and small
fluctuation in receptor backbone, was used for final binding and compatibility analysis. Protein complex
visualization and hydrogen bonds were calculated through UCSF chimera [34] and LIGPLOT software
package [35], and also ensured the number of genuine hydrogen bonds through cavity prediction by
using D3Packets server [36].

3. Results
T- and B-cells are the working horses of the adaptive immune system which are capable to produce
immunological protection against specific pathogens. The function of T- and B cells are based on the
recognition of antigens through specialized receptors and recognized antigenic regions are known as
epitopes. Therefore, identification of epitopes for pathogens is crucial for the understanding of disease
etiology, disease diagnostics, and epitope-based vaccine development. In this study, an effort was made
to identify expressed T- and B-cell epitopes from RNA-seq data of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human
NHBE and A549 cell lines. To achieve this goal, various bioinformatics approaches, tools and software
were used as summarized in figure-1.

3.1 SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome assembly and annotation
De novo SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome was constructed by using publicly available transcriptome data
from SRA project (PRJNA615032). Transcriptome data was generated to the study of SARS-CoV-2
infection in human cell lines NHBE and A549 [13]. Extracted reads were trimmed by removing adapter
and low quality sequences by using trimmomatic-0.39. Reads with a length of less than 20 bps were
also removed from dataset [37]. In order to develop SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome assembly, raw reads
were aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Accession number: MN908947.3, Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate) by

using the RNA-seq alignment tool HISAT2 on default conditions. After read mapping, Samtools and
Bedtools were used to extract mapped RNA reads on SARS-CoV-2 genome. Total, 87,716 reads were
extracted from all the samples. Detail description of experiment, sample name, description, and number
of mapped reads per sample over SARS-CoV-2 genome were given in supplementary material file1
(Table - S1). All the extracted RNA-seq reads were used to construct de novo SARS-CoV-2
transcriptome through Trinity software. In total, 54,814 bases were assembled into 27 transcripts with
median contig length 650 bps, N50 value of 10,677 bps and approximate average transcript length of
2030 bps. The generated transcriptome assembly was clustered at 90 % sequence identity through CDHIT software that produced 27 non-redundant transcripts, the same number of non-redundant transcripts
showed the sequence variability among assembled transcripts. Non-redundant transcripts were
translated into 44 protein sequences through TransDecoder program. Protein sequences were annotated
against Uniport databases by using BLAST similarity search at evalue threshold 1e-10 (Table - 1).

3.2. T-cell epitopes identification of SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome
T-cell epitopes are presented by MHC class I and II that are recognized by two distinct subsets of Tcells, CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells, respectively. NetCTL 1.2 program was used for the prediction T-cell
epitopes, and 1144 epitopes were selected at combined prediction threshold value1.0 for 12 super type
categories i.e. A1 (330), A24(314), A26(242), A2(247), A3(328), B27(175), B39(263), B44(133),
B58(284), B62(473), B7(157), and B8(193). The predicted T-cell epitopes were further evaluated for
antigenicity by VaxiJen server and immunogenicity by IEDB prediction tools, and 598 and 625 epitopes
were shown antigenicity and immunogenicity potential respectively. Finally, 598 antigenicity and
immunogenicity T-cell epitopes were selected for further study. To determine epitopes potential to elicit
effective immune response, 598 selected epitopes were used to explore interacting MHC alleles through
IEDB program. Peptide length nine and the IC50 value =< 200nM were selected as parameters for the
identification of MHC class I binding gene and alleles. MHC class I alleles such as HLA-A, HLA-B,
and HLA-C were recognized with parameter human as MHC source species and IEBD recommended
method to predict a distinct set of MHC class I alleles for all selected 598 epitopes. In MHC-I allele
analysis, HLA-A type alleles were found as more frequently occurring alleles (HLA-A*01:01, HLAA*02:01, HLA-A*02:03, HLA-A*02:06, HLA-A*03:01, HLA-A*11:01, HLA-A*23:01, HLAA*24:02, HLA-A*26:01, HLA-A*30:01, HLA-A*30:02, HLA-A*31:01, HLA-A*32:01, HLAA*33:01, HLA-A*68:01, HLA-A*68:02) than HLA-B type alleles (HLA-B*07:02, HLA-B*08:01,
HLA-B*15:01, HLA-B*35:01, HLA-B*40:01, HLA-B*44:02, HLA-B*44:03, HLA-B*53:01, HLAB*57:01). In our analysis, HLA-C class genes were not found for any epitopes. ToxinPred was used to

immunogenic, antigenic, non-toxic epitopes with good binding affinity to MHC class I alleles. Further,
these epitopes were explored for SARS-CoV-2 proteome for functional characterization.

Similarly, MHC class II gene and allele’s prediction was performed through IEDB analysis resources
by using the same parameters as for MHC class I except the selection of SMM method for the prediction
of a distinct set of MHC class II alleles. Total, 4072 epitopes were identified from protein sequences
with good binding affinity to MHC class II alleles. To select MHC class II alleles and epitopes, we
decided to take those MHC class II alleles and epitopes which have MHC class I epitopes as a core
sequence. Total, 34 MHC class II epitope sequences (15-mer) were selected by using previously

3.3. Population coverage analysis
MHC molecules can form complexes with millions of epitopes which are reflecting the polymorphic
nature of MHC genes. If MHC polymorphism occurs in peptide-binding region, binding specificity of
MHC molecules will be changed. MHC variability has evolutionary advantage to identify variety of
pathogens. But genetic variability among MHC alleles are also a major obstacles in the development of
peptide-based vaccines. Therefore, population coverage is an important criterion to design a generalized
an effective vaccine[38].

Figure -2. Global population coverage through identified epitopes.
In population coverage analysis, MHC class I allele’s of 40 epitopes and MHC class II allele’s of 33
epitopes were used, and a significant population coverage was found for different geographic regions
around the world (Figure-2). MHC class alleles of selected epitopes were covered approximately 90%
of the world population. Highest population coverage was found for Sweden (100%) which was closely
followed by England, Germany, France, Belgium, United States, Russia, Italy, South Korea, Japan,
Mexico, Iran, Chile, Brazil, China, Singapore, Pakistan, India, Spain, Thailand, Israel, Philippines,
Australia, and Vietnam with a population coverage of 99.99%, 99.99%, 99.97%, 99.87%, 99.87%,
99.81%, 99.78%, 99.66%, 99.55%, 99.02%, 98.84%, 98.55%, 98.43%, 97.6%, 97.24%, 97.13%,
97.05%, 96.9%, 96.48%, 96.47%, 96.41%, 96.17%, and 95.91% respectively. The lowest population
coverage were found for Canada (38.31%), Srilanka (42.04) and Ukrain (46.48). United States and
Europe has highest number of COVID-19 cases [39]. Hence, the population coverage prediction is
essential for vaccine design. Population of ethnic groups were also significantly covered
(Supplementary file1: Table -S3), and average coverage for ethnic group across the world is around
93%.
3.4. B-cell epitope identification of SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome.
B-cell epitope is a precise region of the antigenic protein that is detected by B-cell receptors (BCR)
through membrane-bound immunoglobulins. Once B-cell activated, it secretes soluble forms of the

immunoglobulins to neutralize antigenic proteins. Thus, B-cell epitope and B-cell receptor information
is essential for epitope-based vaccine design. Prediction of B-cell epitopes was performed by using
protein sequences of the assembled transcriptome and SARS-CoV-2 protein structures. Total, 330 Bcells epitopes were predicted through BepiPred-2.0 program by using protein sequences, whereas 77 Bcell epitopes were predicted through the IEDB conformational tool ElliPro by using 24 SARS-CoV-2
protein structure, download from Zhang lab. B-cell epitopes prediction from the protein structure is
highly useful information for epitope-based vaccine design and development [40, 41]. Therefore, a
separate analysis was performed for B-cell epitopes identified from protein structures, and 19 epitopes
were identified after toxicity (non-toxic), immunogenicity and antigenicity analysis (Supplementary
file1: Table-S4). In order to explore most suitable B-cell epitopes, epitopes generated by both the
approaches were combined, and total 130 unique B-cell epitopes were identified from length range 9 to
15. 73 B-cell epitopes were predicted as antigenic epitopes through VaxiJen v2.0 webserver and 53 Bcell epitopes were identified as immunogenic. Total, 16 non-toxic B-cell epitopes were identified with
immunogenicity score and antigenicity score more than 0.1 and 0.4 respectively.

ENSP00000263390.3 respectively (Supplementary file1: Table-S5). Finally, 14 B-cell epitope were
found for further analysis (Table - 4). On the basis of immunological parameters, the five B-cell
epitopes, NSP2 (SEQLDFIDTKRGV, HCGETSWQTGDFV), Helicase (KGTLEPEYF), NSP3
Papain-like (KTVGELGDVRE), and Surface glycoprotein (LTGTGVLTESNK) were selected from
Table - 4 for molecular docking studies of B-cell receptors.
3.5. Molecular docking analysis
Cellular immunity gets activated when MHC molecules binds to intracellular and extracellular proteins
displayed on the cell surface. Structural analysis of epitopes and MHC molecules can improve our
knowledge about T-cell based mechanism to reduce disease burden. To explore structural compatibility
between T-cell epitopes and MHC complexes, molecular docking studies were performed to analyze
binding affinities between MHC complexes and T-cell epitopes. Twenty-two MHC proteins were
explored with selected three T-cell epitopes, and the best interaction was identified with the highest
binding affinity. The compatible structural model of epitopes (WPWYIWLGF, VVFLHVTYV, and
FLHVTYVPA) and the MHC molecules were retaining a binding affinity range from of -136.54 to 7.12 kcal/mol. Detail description of molecular interaction analysis of peptide VVFLHVTYV and
identified protein structure of MHC genes were given in Table - 5. Detail docking descriptions of other
two epitopes with MHC molecule were given in supplementary material file1 (Table - S6).

MHC class I and II gene expression analysis was performed by using RNA-seq data of cell lines through
pseudo aligner Kallisto[23]. Expression values of expressed MHC class alleles were given in
supplementary material file1 (Table - S7). HLA-A*24:02 allele was highly expressed among most
frequent occurring MHC alleles, but highest interaction of peptide (VVFLHVTYV) was shown with
HLA-DRB3*02:02 allele with two hydrogen bonds (THR7-ASP152, LEU4-SER120). The epitope
position in protein structure and the binding interactions had shown in Figure - 3. We were also ensured

Similarly, five most antigenic and immunogenic B-cell epitopes were selected for molecular docking
studies with two B-cell receptors (5DRW and 1K1F) through CABSDocks server. 5DRW protein
structure is a crystal structure of BCR Fab fragment from subset of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
whereas 1K1F is dimer structure of Bcr-Abl oncoprotein. 1K1F protein structure provided a base to
design an inhibitor to disrupt Bcr-Abl oligomerization. Moreover, 1K1F was without Fab region unlike
to 5DRW [42]. In our analysis, most of the peptides were shown higher binding affinities with 5DRW
than 1K1F. Detail description of docking studies of B-cell receptor and peptides were given in Table 6.

4. Discussion
SARS-CoV-2 virus has infected more than four million people worldwide, and contagious nature of
virus has imposed the biggest challenge of COVID-19 treatment and prevention. Therefore, vaccine
design, development and production against COVID-19 diseases is an urgent requirement to protect
people from the rising viral attacks. In practice, whole process of vaccine development takes several
years to be completed [43]. But, integration of immunological understanding, high throughput genomics
technologies, and bioinformatics tools and techniques can help us to design effective and safe vaccines
in a short duration. In human research studies, vaccines were shown variable length of protection period
such as chikungunya, rift valley fever virus, and measles, are about 30 years, 12 years, and 65 years,
respectively [44]. In order to develop epitope-based vaccine, the surface glycoprotein is the primary
focus because it is involved in the interaction between virus and human cell receptor, and contribute
significant role in pathogenesis. But, other viral elements are also important to cause disease [45].
Information of expressed regions of viral genome is very important to identify potential vaccine
candidates. In the present study, SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome was used for the molecular cataloguing of
immunodominant epitopes, and result of performed analysis is summarized in Figure-5.

Figure -5. Overview of performed study: genome-wide transcriptome analysis of SARS-CoV-2, T- and
B-cell epitopes, and docked complexes. Docked structures of B-cell receptor and MHC alleles were
given at right-side and their T-and B-cell epitopes were highlighted in yellow colour.
In this study, we used RNA-seq data of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cell lines NHBE and A549.
We extracted the RNA-seq reads for SARS-CoV-2 genome and constructed a transcriptome to explore
expressed regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome. In assembled transcripts, non-structural polyprotein 1ab
related transcripts were found as most abundant transcripts, whereas nucleoprotein, membrane protein,
SARS_X4 domain-containing protein, spike protein were also found in significant numbers. The largest
region of SARS-CoV-2 genome (ORF1ab) was expressed various smaller proteins such as nonstructural proteins (NSP1, NSP2, NSP3, NSP4, NSP6 and NSP8), helicase, uridylate-specific
endoribonuclease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Expression of polyprotein 1ab protein
subcomponent (Table - 1) is clearly reflecting about disease initiation and progression such as
expression of NSP1 protein was indicating the inhibition of host translation machinery by making
NSP1-40S ribosome complex which can cause an endonucleolytic cleavage near the 5' UTR of host
mRNAs for degradation. NSP1 also facilitates viral gene expression in infected cells by suppressing
host gene expression [46]. NSP2 is another expressed transcripts that may have a role in the alteration
of host cell survival signalling pathway by interacting with host prohibitin (PHB) and prohibitin2(PHB2)[47]. NSP3 is known as papain-like proteinase, which is responsible for N-terminus cleavage
of the replicase polyprotein and involved in the assembly of virally-induced cytoplasmic doublemembrane vesicles together with NSP4, necessary for viral replication. NSP3 is an important viral
molecular factor to suppress innate immune induction of type I interferon by blocking the
phosphorylation, dimerization and subsequent nuclear translocation of host interferon regulatory
transcription factor (IRF3), and also suppress NF-kappa-B signalling of host [48, 49]. NSP6 initiate

induction of autophagosomes from host reticulum endoplasmic. But later, it reduces the expansion of
phagosomes to stop delivery of viral components to lysosomes [50]. NSP8, together with NSP7 forms
hexadecamer act as a primase to participate in a viral replication. Expression of helicase is required for
the RNA and DNA duplex-unwinding activities [51].
Antigenicity and immunogenicity are the important parameters of epitopes selection. Antigenicity of
epitopes represents the ability to bind or interact with B-cell or T-cell receptors. T-cell receptors
recognize amino acid sequences of epitopes, when it binds with MHC molecules whereas in B-cell, Bcell receptor interact with these epitopes. To identify antigenic epitopes, all the epitopes were selected
at a threshold antigenicity score greater than 1 (Table - 2). In our antigenicity analysis, epitopes
KSVNITFEL (2.138), IQYIDIGNY (2.096), RELHLSWEV (2.260), and FTIGTVTLK (2.032) were
containing high antigenicity. In comparison of antigenicity, immunogenic features of epitopes triggers
the innate immune response, and later induces adaptive immune response. Antigenic epitopes may or
may not have immunogenicity. But, all immunogenic epitopes will have antigenic potential [52]. In
order to select best immunodominant epitopes, antigenicity (>=1) and immunogenicity (>=0.1), both
criteria were used (Table-2) i.e. WPWYIWLGF (0.417), LSPRWYFYY (0.357), FLFLTWICL (0.354),
FELEDFIPM (0.335), KSVNITFEL (0.330), IQYIDIGNY (0.304), QQWGFTGNL (0.281),
LSYGIATVR (0.256), LVSDIDITF (0.254), and FVKRVDWTI (0.253). Epitopes with higher
antigenicity and immunogenicity scores will have a higher probability of binding with T-and Breceptors to elicit an effective immune response. MHC proteins helps to distinguish cell own proteins
from foreign proteins such as viruses and bacteria. Thus, the binding affinity of these epitopes to MHC
protein is another very important criteria. MHC class I and II genes and alleles were predicted with
lower IC50 values (IC50 =<200) to ensure a higher affinity of epitopes binding with MHC class I proteins.
When MHC class I molecules binds to epitopes, immune system recognizes these epitopes as a foreign
peptide, and the infected cell presents itself as an antigen-presenting cell for self-destruction. For better
sensitivity, CD8+ T-cell epitopes should be generated from both structural and non-structural proteins
because both types of proteins will be processed by infected cells in the cytoplasm, whereas structural
proteins are of interest for CD4+ T-cell epitopes, as it might provide help to cognate interaction [53-55].
In this study, we selected CD4+ T-cell epitopes on the basis of CD8+ T-cell epitope core sequences to
find out the best T-cell epitopes which might provide an immune response for both kinds of MHC
classes. Twelve 15-mer MHC class II epitopes were selected which have core sequences of four 9-mer
epitopes of MHC class I, and all four CD8+ cell epitopes belong to surface glycoprotein (Table - 3).
Diverse repertoire of MHC molecules with the binding ability to a wide range of epitopes, and genetic
variability among SARS-CoV clade antigens are the major scientific challenges to develop generalized
vaccine. In order to address these two challenges, we performed conservation analysis of identified
epitopes through IEDB resources and NCBI Blast, and epitope conservation were ensured among
known sequences. IC50 threshold 500nM or lower values were suggested to selects strong binding
affinity between MHC class protein and epitopes [56]. To ensure MHC class allele specificity, lower

IC50 (=<200nM) values were considered for the selection of MHC alleles and epitopes. Genetic diversity
of MHC molecules across the various ethnic groups worldwide is another the major limitation such as
different MHC class alleles form different geographical region might be presented by a particular set of
epitopes only. To understand demographic coverage of epitopes, population coverage analysis was
performed through selected T-cell epitopes, and analysis revealed that approximately 89.44% and 93%
average coverage can be achieved for world population and population of ethnic groups respectively
(Figure-2, Supplementary file1: Table -S3).
In various B-cell research studies, particular antigen induces distinct class or subclass of antibodies such
as schistosomiasis and filariasis induced a mixed response of IgE and IgG [57, 58]. In order to select
distinct class of epitopes, sequence and structure-based dual approaches were used to identify B-cell
epitope by using BepiPred-2.0 and ElliPro programs. 14 non-toxic, non cross-reactive, antigenic, and
immunogenic B-cell epitopes were identified of different length (Table - 4). Predicted epitopes may or
may not be a key feature of proteins because prediction methods, ignored epitope and receptor
interaction, may be predicted only putative epitopes, which might lead to produce an antibody of no
use. The real epitopes cannot be identified without considering the structural compatibility of complex
formation [41]. Therefore, it became important to determine the structural coordinates of peptidebinding pockets to identify motifs for peptide binding. The specificities of different MHC class alleles
and B-cell receptor’s phenotypes can be used to predict the recognition patterns of epitopes derived
from antigens. The molecular docking approach was used to validate the interaction of three T-cell
epitopes to most frequently occurring twenty-two MHC allele’s structures (Table - 5). Similarly, the
top five B-cell epitopes were used to explore peptide interaction with two different kind of B-cell
receptor proteins (5DRW and 1K1F). First protein structure, 5DRW was considered to evaluate binding
affinity of peptides to BCR antibody light chain, whereas 1K1F was a Bcr-Abl oncoprotein and formed
a tetramer through oligomerization. Monomer of 1K1F protein provided a basis to design an inhibitors
to disrupt Bcr-Abl oligomerization[42]. Therefore, 1K1F was considered as control to compare the
peptide binding affinity to B-cell receptor Fab region binding affinity (Table -6). All peptides showed
higher binding affinity to 5DRW than 1K1F except peptide KTVGELGDVRE (Supplementary file1:
Table - S8). Docked complex of 1K1F and peptides was contained good interaction and total energy (37.47, and -1490.12) and six hydrogen bonds (THR2-PRO125, VAL3-SER127, GLU11-ASN144,
GLY7-SER168, GLY7-SER182). Hydrogen bond visualization of 1K1F protein and peptide were given
in Figure-4.
The MHC genes and regions are one of the highly studied parts of human genome because it is highly
associated with different diseases, immune responses and natural targets for molecular evolution, and
very well characterized at functional levels [59]. Due to biomedical interest, MHC class gene expression
profiling was performed through SARS-CoV-2 RNA-seq data, and HLA-A variants (HLA-A*01, HLAA*02, HLA-A*03, HLA-A*11, HLA-A*24, HLA-A*25, HLA-A*26, HLA-A*30, HLA-A*31, HLAA*32, HLA-A*33, HLA-A*34) were more expressed than HLA-B (HLA-B*08, HLA-B*15,HLA-

B*18,HLA-B*37,HLA-B*44,HLA-B*45) and HLA-C variants (HLA-C*03, HLA-C*04, HLA-C*06,
HLA-C*07, HLA-C*12, HLA-C*16). In MHC class II analysis, HLA-DMA*01, HLA-DMB*01,
HLA-DOB*01, HLA-DPB1*08, HLA-DPB1*75, HLA-DQA1*01, HLA-DQB1*06, HLA-DRA*01
and HLA-DRB1*13 gene variants were highly expressed to present exogenous antigens to CD4+ T
cells. Name of expressed MHC class genes and alleles, expression count (TPM) of alleles with
respective to human cells were given in supplementary material file1 (Table -S8). Total, 92 gene
variants of HLA-A*24 were expressed. Interestingly, very low or no expression for HLA-A*24 gene
variants were observed for A549 cell line. In literature, prevalence of HLA-A*24 alleles was suggested
as risk factors for severe H1N1 infection [60], and HLA-A*24:02 alleles were also reported to increase
diabetes-associated risk together with HLA-B*39:01 gene [61]. A HLA-C allele, HLA-C*03:03, linked
male infertility was also highly expressed in SARS-CoV-2 infected NHBE cell lines. The performed
study on semen quality was reported that presence of HLA-C*03:03 allele was increased two fold in
human papillomavirus virus infected individuals [62]. Three genetic variant of HLA-B*08:01 genes,
myasthenia gravis autoimmune disease characterized by muscle weakness and abnormal fatigability
were also highly expressed in NHBE cell lines [63]. In present, a combination of malaria and AIDS
drugs are in use for the treatment of COVID-19. So, it would be interesting to explore malaria and HIV
associated MHC class allele’s in SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome. Therefore, all the MHC class genes were
analyzed and filtered, and a list of expressed MHC class alleles for malaria and HIV were generated by
using IEDB resources along with expression counts for human cell lines (Supplementary file1: Table S9). HLA-A*02:01:131, HLA-A*02:01:160 and HLA-A*03:01:01:02N were expressed for malaria and
HIV in NHBE cell lines. SARS related two HLA genes (HLA-A*23:01:03, HLA-A*23:01:31) were
expressed, and 34 HLA-A*24:02 were expressed for HIV gag polyprotein in NHBE cell lines. In our
analysis, HLA-A*23:01 HLA-A*24:02 and HLA-A*02:01 were predicted for proposed T-cell epitopes,
and molecular interaction studies were also performed between T-cell epitopes and revealed MHC
alleles.
5. Conclusion
This study has high scientific relevance to understand immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 in the scarcity
of experimental resources. Performed study has provided the extremely useful information about the
expressed region of SARS-CoV-2 genome, potential T- and B- cell epitopes, molecular interaction of
identified epitopes to receptors through various bioinformatics approaches, and gene expression of
MHC class I and II genes. Expressed regions of SARS-CoV-2 genome and putative expressed targets
of human immune response will facilitate vaccine related research studies. Proposed epitopes are
possessing T- and B-cell selectivity, nontoxicity, higher population coverage, and significant interaction
with MHC class I and II genes, and B-cell receptors. However, the presented list of T-and B-cell
epitopes is an outcome of computational analysis. But, all the epitopes were identified from
transcriptome data of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human cell-lines. Therefore, these epitopes have high
