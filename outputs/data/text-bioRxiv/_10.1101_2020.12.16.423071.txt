Abstract
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has caused a world-wide crisis with profound effects on both
healthcare and the economy. In order to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, research
groups have shared viral genome sequence data through the GISAID initiative. We
collected and computationally profiled ~223,000 full SARS-CoV-2 proteome sequences
from GISAID over one year for emergent nonsynonymous mutations. Our analysis shows
that SARS-CoV-2 proteins are mutating at substantially different rates, with most viral
proteins exhibiting little mutational variability. As anticipated, our calculations capture
previously reported mutations occurred in the first period of the pandemic, such as D614G
(Spike), P323L (NSP12), and R203K/G204R (Nucleocapsid), but also identify recent
mutations like A222V and L18F (Spike) and A220V (Nucleocapsid). Our comprehensive
temporal and geographical analyses show two periods with different mutations in the
SARS-CoV-2 proteome: December 2019 to June 2020 and July to November 2020. Some
mutation rates differ also by geography; the main mutations in the second period occurred
in Europe. Furthermore, our structure-based molecular analysis provides an exhaustive
assessment of mutations in the context of 3D protein structure. Emerging sequence-tostructure data is beginning to reveal the site-specific mutational tolerance of SARS-CoV2
proteins as the virus continues to spread around the globe.

1. Introduction
The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the
resulting COVID-19 pandemic are causing a global health and economic crisis. Similar to
related coronavirus, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV [1, 2], SARS-CoV-2 has a
29.9 Kb positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome that encodes 29 viral components
[2, 3]. Most of these components (16 total) are non-structural proteins transcribed as two
large polyproteins (Orf1a and Orf1b) that are processed into individual polypeptides by
viral proteases (Mpro and PLpro). The remainder of the viral proteome encodes for a
variety of accessory and structural components, including the Spike (S), Envelope (E),
Membrane (M), and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins.
Mutations provide the virus with mechanisms to increase the transmissibility, modify
pathogenicity and evade host immunity shifting the antigenic response and causing
resistance to therapeutics. SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA virus, a family with significant adaptive
evolution due to high mutation rates [4]. Although the changes in coronaviruses are
slower than most RNA viruses, there are some viral components in SARS-CoV-2 that
already yielded relevant mutations [4-12]. In addition, there are differences in the behavior
of the multiple viral components. Some proteins, such as the Spike, seem more
susceptible to mutations, likely due to its pivotal role in entering the host cells and altering
infectivity. The functional mean and evolutionary importance of most of the SARS-CoV-2
mutations are still being discussed. Moreover, our results indicate that, as more data
becomes available, new viral mutations show up and further monitoring will be necessary
to evaluate their role. Continue surveillance and knowledge of the main mutations along
with their functional mean can help to reduce the healthcare impact, improve response
during the pandemic and contribute to the successful development of effective vaccines
and drugs that advance in the clinical process.
World-wide research groups are generating and sharing SARS-CoV-2 proteome
sequence data in a rapid fashion as a global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) [13] contains more than
200,000 SARS-CoV-2 proteome sequences labelled by date and region. Sequence data
is of great value to study and track the evolution and expansion of the virus. The Protein
Data Bank is another crucial resource of viral protein information [14]. The 3D crystallized
structure is available for multiple viral proteins, including structural proteins, such as the
Spike and Nucleocapsid, the viral proteases Mpro and PLpro and some non-structural
proteins like NSP12 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), NSP15 (Endoribonuclease) or
the NSP16-NSP10 complex, among others. Combination of both resources, i.e. mapping
sequence data with the available structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), creates
an analysis tool with direct applications in the design of diagnostic tests, vaccines and
drugs. Through this type of analysis, we can generate hypothesis about the crucial role
of mutations in biological binding and their implication in protein function.
In this article we provide a comprehensive analysis of how much the SARS-CoV-2
virus has changed in a year using a collection of more than 223,000 proteomes. Using
sequences deposited in GISAID, we quantified the mutations rates for the global

proteome and the individual protein residues. Our dynamic temporal and geographical
analysis identified two periods with a different mutational landscape, from December 2019
to June 2020, and from July to November 2020. The first period was critical for some
previously described mutations that overtook the entire globe, such as the D614G and
P323L in the Spike and NSP12 respectively [5, 8]. In the second period, additional
mutations in the Spike and the Nucleocapsid were notably detectable in multiple countries
in Europe. Additionally, we mapped the sequence mutations into 3D structures using the
available crystallized viral proteins and further hypothesized their role and impact in
protein function. These observations illuminate the correlation between sequence
mutations and 3D protein structure. Our findings are in agreement with previous studies
with smaller sequence sets, confirms anterior results and provides new insights about
current mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Our temporal, geographical and molecular
mapping has applicability in tracking viral evolution, provides surveillance support and
guides the viral mechanistic comprehension crucial in the development of diagnostic
tests, vaccines and drugs.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1.

Components of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome are mutating at different rates

The multiple viral components behave in a different manner from a mutational
perspective. In this section we analyzed the components of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome
and identified the high frequency mutating viral proteins along with initial and more recent
relevant residue mutations.
The SARS-CoV-2 proteome sequences, epidemiological, temporal and geographical
data is available at the GISAID initiative [13]. We collected ~223,000 full SARS-CoV-2
proteome aligned sequences from GISAID along with additional metadata from
December 2019 to November 2020. For each viral protein we calculated individual
residue mutation rates (MRs) and ranked residue variability to study the main viral
mutations (Figure 1 and S1 of the Supplementary Material. Residue MRs are also
provided in Table S1 as part of the Supplementary Material). As a measure of protein
variability, we calculated the range in the residue mutation rates for each protein in the
proteome. The proteins with highest range are the Spike, NSP12, NS9c and
Nucleocapsid (Figure 1A). Our analysis showed that the viral components are evolving at
different rates. Some proteins, like the Envelope (E) protein, have low MRs across the
residue sequence while other viral components, such as the Spike (S) or the
Nucleocapsid (N) showed higher degree of variability. Our results yielded some residues
with higher mutation rates and confirmed some important mutations already described in
the bibliography.
2.1.1 High frequency mutating SARS-CoV-2 proteome components
Several SARS-CoV-2 proteins are mutating at appreciably rapid rates. While it is
currently unclear if these mutations benefit the virus, their continued surveillance and the
detection of new proteome variants are likely to illuminate keys aspects of viral function.

As will be discussed, the identification and analysis of mutations in the Spike protein are
beginning to provide such insight [5, 15]. However, the effects of mutations in other high
frequency mutating viral components, such as the Nucleocapsid and NS9c proteins, is
less clear. Here, we summarize the high frequency mutations that have been observed
in the SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
Spike protein. The residue D614 of the Spike (S) protein showed a mutation rate
in October-November 2020 of 0.999. The D614G mutation has already been studied in
different publications [5, 9]. The Spike (S) glycoprotein mediates the entry of SARS-CoV2 into the host cells. The D614G mutation has been associated with an increase of
infectivity but not with an augment of the disease severity [5, 15]. A222V and L18F in the
Spike were also mutations detected in our analysis (MRs = 0.61 and 0.31 respectively)
(Figure 1B).
NSP12 protein. The P323L mutation in the NSP12 (RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase, RdRp) protein accompanies the D614G (S) mutation in most of the analyzed
sequences (MR=0.994). This dual mutation has also been reported for multiple research
groups [5, 16]. As RdRp catalyzes the replication of RNA, the P323L mutation could affect
the speed of the viral replication [16]. However, the P323L mutation is situated far away
from the catalytic site. Other mutated residues in RdRp showed lower mutation rates,
such as A185 (MR=0.04) and V776 (MR=0.04) and occupied remote positions from the
pocket.
Nucleocapsid protein. The Nucleocapsid is another target essential in the
production of viral particles, involved in RNA replication, transcription and genome
assembly [17]. The Nucleocapsid also presented two consecutive residues with high
mutation rates, equivalent to the mutations R203K and G204R (MRs = 0.23) (Figure 1B)
[9]. Although these mutations generated lower expectation in previous literature, the
residues could impact key regions for the transcription and replication of SARS-CoV-2
[18]. However, our latest data indicates that the virus is mutating back to its initial form in
those residue positions. Another mutation in the Nucleocapsid, the A220V, has gained
importance recently (MR=0.57). This mutation along with A222V (Spike) have been
already included in a new viral variant spread in Europe during the summer 2020 [19].
The next most mutated residues in the N protein were S194 and M234 with MRs of 0.06
and 0.05, respectively.
NS9c accessory protein. Mutations such as G50N (MR=0.25) and L67F (MR=0.63)
in the NS9c are highly correlated with residues R203/G204 and A220 from the
Nucleocapsid due to possible overlapping in the reading frame.
Other viral proteins showed mutations in multiple positions, although the mutation
rates are notably lower (Figure S1). Changes in residue Q57 in the NS3 (MR=0.11) [20]
or residue L37 in the NSP6 (MR=0.06) should also be further monitored. More studies
would be necessary to clarify their implication in the viral cycle life.

2.2.

The temporal emergence of proteome mutations

As coronaviruses have high adaptive evolution, we expect that SARS-CoV-2
present significant temporal variations. Some factors can condition the different viral
variants. Growing evidence indicates that climate and seasonal effects, including
temperature, humidity, sunlight and people’s habits, can contribute to the expansion of
the virus [21]. Country-specific factors, such as demography, cultural practices, social
interventions, travel restrictions, quarantine policies, health care capacity and reporting
and tracking mechanisms, can also alter viral expansion and variation. We analyzed the
evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus over a year, including multiple seasons. As expected,
temporal analysis yielded important variations in short periods of time. Here we provide
multiple examples of temporal differences in viral protein mutation rates that exhibit a
variety of behaviors.
We divided the GISAID global sequence data over several months and performed
a temporal residue mutation analysis for the whole proteome and the main mutations
D614G (S), A222V (S), L18F (S), P323L (NSP12), R203K (N), G204R (N), A220V (N),
G50N (NS9c) and L67F (NS9c) (see Figure 2). Global analysis of the proteome temporal
data showed two different periods in the mutational evolution of SARS-CoV-2. We
observed two different mutational tendencies from December 2019 to June 2020 (first
period) and from July to November 2020 (second period). The global results were
confirmed by the detailed temporal analysis of the individual residue mutations.
The virus proteome changed gradually over time reaching a maximum variation in
the last analyzed month, November 2020 (global proteome MR=0.0011). However, the
temporal analysis showed two periods with different slope in the mutational variation: in
the first period, until June 2020, the proteome changed more abruptly and the mutation
rate raised rapidly whereas the second period, from July until November 2020, showed a
proteome stabilization with a slight increase in the global mutation rate (Figure 2A). Both
periods are more remarkable when we analyze from a temporal perspective the main
residue mutations.
When we investigated the residue mutations occurred during the first period, such
as the D614G and P323L mutations, the ascend in the residue mutation rate is steeper
in March with an abrupt rise in the mutation rate from 0.20 to 0.69 until a current value of
~1 (Figure 2B). It is worth noting that the sequences collected from March to April
represented more than 35% of the complete dataset. The mutation rates for residues
R203/G204 of the Nucleocapsid and G50 in NS9c increased in a more gradually fashion
until reaching values of ~0.69-0.77 in July 2020. However, from that date on (second
period), the MR in those residues decreased to a value of ~0.20 in November 2020.
In our data there is a group of residues that played a more important role during
the second period. The MRs of residues A222 (S), A220 (N) and L67 (NS9c) started to
gradually increase in August until yielding values of ~0.66-0.72 in November 2020. L18
(S) followed a similar pattern and reached an up-to-date MR of 0.39. These new mutations
should be further monitored to establish if they play a key role in the viral life cycle.

2.3.

World-wide geographical and temporal differences in proteome variation

As described previously, country-specific factors contribute to the viral variation
and generate different patterns in the pandemic expansion. Our analysis indicated
geographical differences in viral protein mutation rates and exhibited a variety of
expansion behaviors. From a global perspective, we detected progressive increments in
the proteome variability by country throughout the 2020. In agreement with Figure 2A, the
proteome in April presents an average MR close to 0.001 in multiple countries world-wide.
The proteome MR increases in most of the countries during the second period and
overcomes the 0.001 threshold in September 2020 (Figure 3A).
We also monitored the residue mutation rate over time in different geographic
regions of the world for residues D614 (S), A222 (S), L18 (S), P323 (NSP12), R203 (N),
G204 (N), A220 (N), G50 (NS9c) and L67 (NS9c) (Figure 3B). Our data showed that
D614G (S) and P323L (NSP12) mutations overtook the entire globe. Mutations R203K
(N), G204R (N) and G50N (NS9c) spread over the world but are less stable than the
mutation D614G (S) and those residue positions were subjected to back-mutation
towards the original state in multiple areas. More recent viral mutations, such as A222V
(S), L18F (S), A220V (N), and L67F (NS9c) were mostly detected in Europe and should
be further monitored to estimate their impact in viral evolution. A detailed description of
the geographical evolution of these mutations is provided below.
Spike. The D614G mutation was already present in January 2020 in the sequences
analyzed from Germany (MR=1, sequences=9). We detected in that period the D614G
mutation in Australia and China, but the original residue was still highly conserved
(MRs=0.05 and 0.01 respectively). Surprisingly, the sequences evaluated from Germany
in February showed a decrease in D614 mutation (MR=0.46). As previously reported [5],
half of the analyzed sequences coincided with the initial Wuhan form. However, in
February other countries showed a remarkable increase in the presence of the D614G
mutation, such as Saudi Arabia (MR=1), Switzerland (MR=0.97), Italy (MR=0.96), France
(MR=0.81), Austria (MR=0.75), the Netherlands (MR=0.625) and Brazil (MR=0.6 but only
5 analyzed sequences). The United Kingdom and Spain showed MRs of 0.40 and 0.30.
In North America, the U.S. still presented a MR for D614 of 0.06 whereas Canada showed
higher evolution in this period (MR=0.33). In China, the MR was in the same range as
previously reported in January (MR=0.01). There are additional countries with high D614
MRs but more representative data would be necessary to extract any conclusions (less
than 5 collected sequences).
As described in Figure 2, the high increase in the incidence of the D614G mutation
happened in March, where there are many countries in different areas of the globe with
MR higher than 0.90, such as Estonia (MR=1), Morocco (MR=1), Argentina (MR=1),
Romania (MR=1), Faroe Islands (MR=1), Italy (MR=0.99), Hungary (MR=0.98), Bosnia
and Herzegovina (MR=0.96), Russia (MR=0.96), Switzerland (MR=0.95), France
(MR=0.94), Croatia (MR=0.94), Brazil (MR=0.94), Denmark (MR=0.93), Luxembourg
(MR=0.93), Czech Republic (MR=0.93), Costa Rica (MR=0.92), Sweden (MR=0.92) and

Democratic Republic of the Congo (MR=0.91). It is worth mentioning that residue D614
showed a slower evolution in China and neighboring countries in Asia compared to the
rest of the world. This situation is remarkable in April 2020 when the mutation rates for
the residue were higher than 0.75 in most of the world except in some Asian countries
with mutation rates between 0.3 and 0.75. After May 2020, D614 was more than 90%
mutated in practically all the globe and the latest data from November 2020 shows the
G614 mutated residue in practically the 100% of the sequences. Based on the difference
in the temporal and geographical expansion of the mutation, we performed an enrichment
analysis during April 2020 to investigate if there is an association between low D614
mutation rates and reduced mortality (number of deaths per million) in the different
countries. Our goal was to investigate if the mutation could cause higher infectivity and,
hence, an increase in mortality. Previous studies have shown significant correlations
between the presence of D614G mutation and increased case fatality rates [22, 23]. We
established different thresholds for the MRs and mortality. We detected an enrichment
factor > 1.25 with associated p-values < 0.05 in 6 out of 12 calculations. Conversely, we
only found significant results in 1 out of 12 thresholds when we looked for an association
between higher MRs or presence of the D614G mutation and increased mortality. In
addition, when we extended our analysis to all the residues in all the proteins (~10,000
residues) we did not find associations between MRs and mortality. We corrected our
analysis by multiple hypothesis using Bonferroni and BHFDR methods [24] and all the
possible associations failed the test. More studies are necessary to prove possible
associations between SARS-CoV-2 mutations and mortality.
The sequences deposited from July to November 2020 yielded new mutations in
the SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 3B). According to our data, the A222V (Spike) mutation was
already detected in March in Iran, in April in Turkey and in May in Mexico, Japan and
Canada, among others, although the MR of the A222 residue was still low (~0.03).
However, in June 2020 the mutation is clearly detected in Spain (MR=0.42) and mildly in
Senegal (MR=0.05). The mutation spread in July to Gibraltar (MR=0.2) and slightly to
Norway, Belgium, Ireland and Switzerland (MRs~0.06-0.02). The variant with A222V
completely overtook Spain in August (MR=0.87) and continued its expansion to Norway
(MR=0.40), Italy (MR=0.27), Latvia (MR=0.24), Switzerland (MR=0.22), the United
Kingdom (MR=0.18), Denmark (MR=0.17) and other European countries (France, the
Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, Sweden and Belgium). Outside Europe, the mutation was
detected in China although with low rates (MR=0.05). The data in September showed that
the mutation was present mainly in Spain (MR=0.86), Ireland (MR=0.51), the United
Kingdom (MR=0.46), Lithuania (MR=0.44), Denmark (MR=0.35), Switzerland (MR=0.34),
the Netherlands (MR=0.29), Germany (MR=0.24), Sweden (MR=0.15), France
(MR=0.14), Italy (MR=0.13) and Belgium (MR=0.11). The sequences in OctoberNovember yielded an increase of the A222V mutation in multiple countries in Europe, in
New Zealand (MR=0.31), Tunisia (MR=0.29) and Singapore (MR=0.1). A similar
distribution pattern was found for the A220V mutation of the Nucleocapsid. Previous
studies already confirmed a cluster variant with both A222V and A220V that emerged
during the summer, presumably in Spain, and posteriorly spread in Europe [19].

The mutation L18F in the Spike was marginally present in different countries in
March (MRs ~0.005). The MR increased to 0.06 in United Arab Emirates in June 2020
although we only collected a sample of 17 sequences. The data showed that the mutation
was residually present in multiple countries until it expanded into the United Kingdom
(MR=0.07 and 6,761 analyzed sequences), China (MR=0.05, 42 sequences) and
Colombia (MR=0.13 but only 8 analyzed sequences) in August 2020. We detected in
September an increase in the incidence of the mutation in Lithuania (MR=0.4, 25
sequences), the United Kingdom (MR=0.23 and 14,742 sequences), Chile (MR=0.2, only
5 available sequences), Ireland (MR=0.06, 179 sequences), Sweden (MR=0.04, 54
sequences), India (MR=0.03, 119 sequences) and Singapore (MR=0.03, 33 sequences).
The last data in October-November 2020 showed a MR in the United Kingdom of 0.41
(9,577sequences) and 0.14 in Norway (85 sequences) (Figure 3B). Future surveillance
of the new Spike mutations is necessary to estimate the importance of the variations.
NSP12. The viral variant with D614G contains also the P323L mutation in the
NSP12. As a result, same conclusions can be extracted for both variations. We observed
a clear correlated evolution by country between residues D614 and P323 (Figure 3B).
Nucleocapsid. The mutations in the Nucleocapsid, located mainly in residues R203
and G204, showed different evolution patterns compared to D614G (Figure 3B). In
February 2020 different European countries already displayed the R203K mutation. The
residue was highly mutated in the sequences analyzed from Switzerland (MR=0.76),
Austria (MR=0.75) and the Netherlands (MR=0.56), although more countries exhibited
the mutation with lower mutation rates, such as Italy (MR=0.20), Germany (MR=0.16),
Spain (MR=0.13), the United Kingdom (MR=0.13) and France (MR~0.10). In this period
the mutation was incipient in U.S. (MR~0.04). In March 2020, the R203K mutation had
already extended to other countries, such as Brazil, Greece, Czech Republic, Estonia,
Ireland, Russia, Vietnam, among others, with a MR higher than 0.5. Nevertheless, it was
in Brazil and Vietnam in April and in Lithuania, Russia, Oman and Zimbabwe in May
where the R203K mutation reached the threshold of 90%. The residue evolution in the
U.S. was slower but in May 2020 the mutation rate increased to 0.15. The rate increased
again in June until 0.24, although the data in July showed contradictory conclusions with
a lower MR of 0.19. The MR continued to decline until reaching a value of 0.13 in
November. The MR decrease in the U.S. was not an isolated phenomenon and the virus
after July 2020 retrieved the primitive residue in multiple countries. A similar pattern was
found for residue G204 (N) with a decline in the MR in the last months in most of the
countries. As described previously, the evolution of residue A220 in the Nucleocapsid is
highly correlated with the data obtained for residue A222 in the Spike.
NS9c. Residues L67 and G50 in the NS9c showed similar expansion patterns as
residues A220 and R203/G204 in the Nucleocapsid. Overlapping in the reading frame
could be the cause of the highly correlated evolution detected for these residues.

Residue variation at 3D molecular level: mapping into crystallized proteins

The 3D analysis of the viral mutations contributes to understand the key role of specific
residues, helps in the assessment of pharmacological targets and guides the design and
development of novel therapeutics. We mapped the SARS-CoV-2 sequence mutations
into the crystallized 3D protein structures available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [14].
We plotted high frequency mutations (already described throughout the manuscript) and
low frequency mutations. Most of the proteins are highly conserved and the punctual
mutations are not close to the main catalytic sites. Multiple viral proteins could be
promising drug targets from the evolutionary perspective. Figure 4 shows the main
mutations located in the 3D SARS-CoV-2 protein structures.
The Spike (S) is a homo-trimeric transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates the viral
entry into the host cells [25-27]. The Spike is the main target in the development of most
of the vaccines [28] and residue variability could affect protective efficacy. The protein
contains two subunits, S1 (14–685 residues) and S2 (686–1273 residues), in charge of
binding to the host receptor and fusion of the host and viral membranes. The main
mutation located at D614 is on the surface of each protomer (Figure 4A). The D614
established a stabilizing hydrogen bond with the residue T859 of the adjacent protomer.
The mutation D614G could interrupt the mentioned hydrogen bond between both
protomers, provide higher protein flexibility or even modify glycosylation at close residues,
such as N616 [5]. As we have shown in our prior work [29-32], ionizable residues can be
important for the pH responses of proteins, include viral components. Given the influence
of pH in viral entry mechanisms [33] and the nature of D614 as an ionizable residue, the
mutation could affect the pH-dependent responsiveness of the virus as it enters through
the increasingly acidified endocytic pathway. One motivation for our efforts in the future
will be to assess the frequency with which ionizable residues (E, C, D, H, K, R, Y) are
mutated in viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, and their role in pH-dependent endocytic entry.
The mutations A222V and L18F are far from the main D614G mutation and are located
in the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit. Alanine substitution by the bulkier valine in
A222V can change inter-residue contacts and the 3D structure of the region. Both
mutations D614G and A222V are located within areas defined as possible B-cell epitopes
[34]. This could provide to the virus an evasive immunological advantage to avoid B-cell
response. L18F is not represented in the 3D structure since the crystallized protein is
missing residues M1-P26. The crystallized structure is also missing residues S477
(MR=0.05) and A262 (MR=0.03). Additional mutations with lower mutational rate are
represented in Figure 4A, such as S98, D215 and P272 in the N-terminal or E583, close
to the Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD), which is an essential region in the binding of the
host cell receptor ACE2. Moreover, a former study in SARS-CoV associated residues 1422 of S1 with the induction of COX-2 expression [35]. Although additional studies in
SARS-CoV-2 would be necessary, mutations in this area of the S protein in the SARSCoV-2 could be implicated in COX-2 expression and related to the inflammation response
and severity of the disease.

The Nucleocapsid participates on the vital cycle of the virus in RNA assembly and
release of viral particles [36]. It is an important target for pharmacological intervention,
not only in the discovery of drugs but also in the development of vaccines [37]. Some of
the residue mutations could interfere in the pharmacological intervention. The SARSCoV-2 crystallized structures available at the PDB show the N2b and the RNA binding
domains and do not contain key residues from the evolutionary perspective (Figure 4B).
Residues R203/G204 (MR~0.23) are not present in the crystallized structures along with
A220 (MR=0.57), S194 (MR=0.06), M234 (MR=0.05), A376 (MR=0.04), A398 (MR=0.03),
P365 (MR=0.03), P199 (MR=0.03) or D377 (MR=0.02), among other residues with MR
greater than 0.01.
The NSP12 protein, also called RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an
important pharmacological target in viral intervention. Mutations in different viral RdRPs
have been associated with drug resistance [38, 39]. The FDA-approved treatment for
COVID-19, Remdesivir, binds the catalytic site of RdRp causing a decrease in the
production of viral RNA. Our analysis showed that RdRp in SARS-CoV-2 is highly
conserved as 925 residues out of 932 yielded MRs<0.005 (see Figure 4C). The residues
with higher MRs, P323 (MR=0.99), A185 (MR=0.04), V776 (MR=0.04), A656 (MR=0.03),
V720 (MR=0.03) and E254 (MR=0.03) are not close to the catalytic site. However,
computational studies have shown that P323L and A185V mutations could have an effect
in the preservation of the secondary structure of the protein that could affect protein
function and drug binding [40]. Alternatively, a possible binding site was described in a
hydrophobic region in close proximity to P323 [8]. RdRp forms a polymerase complex
with NSP7 and NSP8 to improve RNA synthesizing activity. This complex can associate
with NSP14, which is involved in replication fidelity [41]. Mutations that alter complex
interactions could affect RNA replication. In fact, the mutation P323L is near the binding
region between NSP12 and NSP8 and could have an impact in the polymerase complex
stability (Figure 4C).
NSP15, the viral Endoribonuclease, is another possible drug target that was
analyzed from the mutational point of view. The main mutated residues are T34
(MR=0.04), A82 (MR=0.02) and T115 (MR=0.02) (Figure 4D). The protein is highly
conserved, and no important mutations were detected close to the catalytic site. However,
some of the cited residues could collaborate in the formation of the oligomeric structure.
The protein is a hexamer where the different monomers interact each other. The
assembly of the hexamer is potentially sensitive to the mutations, especially in the Nterminal and middle domains [42]. T34, located in the N-terminal and T115 in the middle
domain could play a role in the stabilization/destabilization of the hexamer with important
implications for the Endoribonuclease functionality.
The heterodimer NSP16-NSP10 protects SARS-CoV-2 from the host immune
response [43]. Additionally, disruption of NSP16 decreased the production of RNA in
SARS-CoV [44]. Targeting NSP16 can facilitate immune response and decrease
pathogenicity and, hence, it could be a key target in drug design. Furthermore, multiple
binding sites have been described [43], including the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) site,
the RNA cap substrate cavity, and a third distant pocket unique to SARS-CoV-2 bound to

adenosine. Our sequence analysis showed low mutation rates for residues in both NSP16
and NSP10. From a mutational perspective, the NSP16 pockets are highly conserved
and composed of residues with MRs lower than 0.01 (Figure 4E). Residue R216
(MR=0.013) is close to the adenosine binding pocket. Important functionality of the
NSP16-NSP10 complex, diversity in the binding sites and mutational stability point the
heterodimer as an interesting drug target.
Another target studied by multiple research groups from the point of view of drug
discovery and design is the viral main protease Mpro (NSP5) [45-48]. However, Mpro as
a promising target for drug discovery against SARS-CoV-2 has risen some concerns [45].
A flexible loop constituted by residues C44-P52 can occlude the accessibility of the
catalytic pocket and limit the entrance of the ligands [45]. Additionality, the plasticity of
the catalytic site could make it vulnerable even to distant mutations. Our analysis
identified low frequency mutations in K90 (MR=0.02), L89 (MR=0.01), G15 (MR=0.01),
and P132 (MR=0.01) (Figure 4F). The cited residues are not in close proximity to either
the catalytic site or two alternative binding areas described in crystallized Mpro structures
(PDB_code: 5RFA, 5RGQ, 5RF0). The results showed that the main protease is a very
conserved protein with high interest in drug discovery.
Other possible viral pharmacological targets yielded high degree of conservation
in all the residues, such as the RNA replicase (NSP9) with role in viral RNA synthesis and
viral replication [49] (all residues with MR<0.005 except M101 with MR of 0.03), the ADP
ribose phosphatase, unit of the large multidomain NSP3 with possible functionality in the
interference of the host immunological response [50] (MRs≤0.005 except H295 with MR
of 0.01), and the PL protease, unit of the NSP3 (Figures 4G, 4H, 4I). All the PL protease
residues presented MRs < 0.01 except P223 (residue P968 of the NSP3) with MR=0.03.
The mutation in P223 is in the S1 ubiquitin region, one of the binding sites for ubiquitin
and ubiquitin-like protein ISG15. This enzyme plays an essential role in replication and
processing of viral proteins [51] but also could decrease host immunological response by
collaborating in deubiquitinating and deISGylating activities [52, 53]. SARS-CoV-2-PLpro
could be an excellent drug target with high residue conservation, participates in viral
replication and modulates signaling in infected cells.
Low mutation rates and their important role in the virus life cycle make these
proteins attractive targets for pharmacological intervention. However, according to our
data, some proteins, such as the Spike or the Nucleocapsid, showed higher degree of
variability in specific residues and could present future liabilities in the efficacy of vaccines
and therapeutics.

3. Methods
3.1.

Sequence data and residue mutation rates

GISAID database was accessed on November 30th 2020 and the complete SARSCoV-2 sequence aligned data from December 2019 was downloaded. Our database was
12

composed of ~223,000 sequences representing 27 viral proteins. The residue mutation
rates (MRs) of the human sequences were calculated in Python [54] considering
sequences with the same length, including gaps, as the original Wuhan sequences
extracted in December 2019 for all the viral proteins. Residue MRs for protein j were
computed as the ratio between the frequency in which the original residue is replaced in
the protein j sequences and the total number of analyzed protein j sequences. MRs for
Figure 1 were calculated comparing sequences from October to November 2020 against
original sequences from China in December 2019. Protein range was calculated as the
difference between the maximum and the minimum MRs.
3.2.

Temporal analysis

Temporal fragmentation of the data was carried out extracting the sequences labeled
according to the date and corresponding to consecutive months. For each period, MRs
calculation was performed for each residue in the proteins and the global proteome using
Python [54]. Protein variation was computed as the average of all its residue MRs.
Periodical proteome variation was calculated as the average of all protein variations in
each month. For clarity in the analysis, we considered two periods in the pandemic: a first
period from December 2019 to June 2020 and a second period from July to November
2020.
3.3.

Temporal/geographical analysis

Temporal and geographical fragmentation and data analysis were performed in
Python and MATLAB [54, 55]. Sequence data was partitioned by date and country (~125
world-wide countries). Multiple names representing the same country were manually
inspected and unified. Residue MRs were computed as described above and plotted in
world maps using MATLAB.
Association analysis between residue mutation rates and mortality in the countries
were implemented with April 2020 data (period with high volume of available sequences
and peak of the pandemic). We defined positive and negative cases using multiple
thresholds for the mutation rates and mortality, measured as deaths per million [56]. The
analysis calculated overrepresentation of countries with high/low residue mutation rates
and high/low mortality. Enrichment factors with associated p-values were computed. All
the residues were included in the analysis and p-values were corrected by multiple
hypothesis using Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate (BHFDR)
methods.
3.4.

Protein structure-based mutational analysis

Mapping sequence mutations into colored 3D crystallized proteins was performed in
PyMOL [57]. The set of viral proteins with available crystallized structure in the PDB are
part of the analysis. MRs for Figure 4 were computed comparing sequence data from
October to November 2020 against initial SARS-CoV-2 sequences sent by December
2019.
