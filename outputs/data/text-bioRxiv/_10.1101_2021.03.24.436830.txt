Abstract

32

Although there are several reports in the literature of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cats, few SARS-CoV-

33

2 sequences from infected cats have been published. In this report, SARS-CoV-2 infection was

34

evaluated in two cats by clinical observation, molecular biology (qPCR and NGS), and serology

35

(Microsphere immunoassay and seroneutralization). Following the observation of symptomatic SARS-

36

CoV-2-infection in two cats, infection status was confirmed by RT-qPCR and, in one cat, serological

37

analysis for antibodies against N-protein and S-protein, as well as neutralizing antibodies.

38

Comparative analysis of five SARS-CoV-2 sequence-fragments obtained from one of the cats showed

39

that this infection was not with one of the three recently emerged variants of SARS-CoV-2. This study

40

provides additional information on the clinical, molecular, and serological aspects of SARS-CoV-2

41

infection in cats.

Introduction

45

SARS-CoV-2 has shown relatively generalist capacities by infecting many animal species, making it a

46

good-model in One Health research (MacLean et al., 2021). Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 infections have

47

been detected in numerous animal species living in close contact with infected humans. Based on

48

RNA detection, serological studies, and experimental infections, numerous animal species have

49

proven susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 (Shi et al., 2020), including Mustelidae (ferret, mink) (Oude

50

Munnink et al., 2020), Canidae (dog) (Sit et al., 2020), Felidae (cat, tiger, lion) (Sailleau et al., 2020)

51

and Cricetidae (hamster, rat, mouse) (Sia et al., 2020) as well as by the highly transmissible British

52

variant (B.1.1.7) (Ferasin et al., 2021) . On March 24th, the World Organisation for Animal Health

53

reports cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in cats in 17 countries (USA, China, Belgium, Germany,

54

Spain, France, Russia, United-Kingdom, Japan, Italy, Chile, Brazil, Greece, Canada, Argentina,

55

Switzerland, and Latvia). In the medical and scientific literature, we found 23 papers examining

56

natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in a total of 2242 cats (Barrs et al., 2020; Carlos et al., 2021; Chen,

57

Pagani et al., 2021; Patterson et al., 2020; Ruiz-Arrondo et al., 2020; Sailleau et al., 2020; Segalés et

61

al., 2020; Stevanovic et al., 2020; Temmam et al., 2020; Villanueva-Saz et al., 2021; Zhang et al.,

62

2020). Among these cats, only 94 were positive for ongoing or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, as

63

detected by qPCR or by serology. Additionally, the U.S Department of Agriculture has reported 67

64

cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in cats identified by at least one of these assays. Viral RNA detected

65

in 25 cats suggested that COVID-19 infections were transmitted from infected owners. These few

66

sequences are available (31 on Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (Gisaid) and 18 on

67

Genbank) (https://www.gisaid.org/ ; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). While most cases of

68

SARS- CoV-2 infection in cats were asymptomatic, some cats (14/94) experienced lethargy, mild

69

respiratory or digestive symptoms (sneezing, coughing, ocular discharge, vomiting, and anorexia), and

70

two studies reported severe respiratory problems in two cats (Garigliany et al., 2020; Musso et al.,

71

2020). Recently, a study has shown association between B.1.1.7 infection and clinical signs of

72

myocarditis in cats (Ferasin et al., 2021). Moreover, several experimental studies have shown that

73

SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted between cats (Bosco-Lauth et al., 2020; Gaudreault et al., 2020;

74

Halfmann et al., 2020). As yet, there is no evidence of cat-to-human transmission. Here we present a

75

clinical and biological investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection of two cats that presented with mildly

76

symptomatic disease, and that came from households with confirmed cases of COVID-19 sampled

77

during the second wave (October-November 2020) of infections in France.

First line diagnostic: Veterinary diagnostic laboratory (VEBIO)

81

RNA extraction

82

RNA extraction from nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs was done using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit

83

(QIAGEN). Swabs were resuspended in 200µl of ATL + 20µl of proteinase K then heated at 70°C for

84

10 min. 200µl of ATL + 20µl of proteinase K was then added, and again heated to 70°C. Finally,

85

200µl of ethanol was added and the entire volume (640µl) transferred to a column. Subsequent steps

86

proceeded according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

87

Real-time reverse-transcription PCR

88

Viral RNA was quantified using real the Genesig® Real Time PCR Coronavirus COVID-19 (CE IVD)

89

kit (Primer Design) using the manufacturer’s protocol and QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System

90

thermocycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific)

91

Second-line diagnostic: Virology laboratory of Caen Hospital

92

RNA extraction and Removal of genomic DNA

93

Nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs were resuspended in 500µl of PBS, of which 140µl was used for

94

RNA extraction using the EZ1 RNA Tissue Mini kit (QIAGEN). The homogenate was then treated

95

with the Turbo DNA-free kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), according to the manufacturer’s protocol, in

96

order to remove genomic DNA.

97

Ribosomal RNA Depletion and Real-time reverse-transcription PCR

98

Critical to enable cost-effective sequencing of RNA samples, we depleted the eukaryotic rRNA using

99

the NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat). After rRNA depletion, double-stranded

100

cDNA was synthesized by real-time reverse-transcription (RT-PCR) using Superscript III platinium

101

One-step Quantitative RT-PCR System (Invitrogen) as described previously with minor modifications

102

(Corman et al., 2020). Briefly, a 25 μL reaction contained 5 μL of RNA, 12.5 μL of 2 × reaction

103

buffer, 1 μL of reverse transcriptase/ Taq mixture, 0.4 μL of a 50 mM magnesium sulphate solution

104

(Invitrogen), 1µl of a 10µM primer, and 0.5l µl of a 10µM probe. Thermal cycling was performed at

105

50 °C for 15 min for reverse transcription, followed by 95 °C for 2 min and then 45 cycles of 95 °C

106

for 15 s and 60 °C for 30 s using a Light Cycler 480 (Roche).

107

To increase the amount of genetic material available for sequencing, whole transcriptome

108

amplification (WTA) was performed with QuantiTect Whole Transcriptome kit (QIAGEN) according

109

to the manufacturer’s instructions. Amplified DNA reactions was then purified using AMPure XP

110

beads and quantified using Qbit dsDNA BR Assay Kit on a Qubit 3.0 fluorimeter (Invitrogen).

111

In complement to the de novo approach, we also used an adapted version of the published protocol

112

from the ARTIC Network using ARTIC (Quick, 2020) primer scheme version 3 which produces ~400

113

bp overlapping amplicons over the SARS-CoV-2 genome.

114

ONT library preparation and MinION sequencing

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.24.436830; this version posted March 24, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

115

Libraries were prepared without shearing to maximize sequencing read length. The Oxford Nanopore

116

Technology (ONT) protocol for native barcoding genomic DNA sequencing was followed using the

117

barcoded ligation sequencing kit SQK-LSK108 and the EXP-NBD104 Native Barcoding kit.

118

Sequencing libraries were constructed, and sequencing performed according to manufacturer’s

119

instructions, as briefly described below. First, the NEBNext Ultra II End Repair/dATailing module

120

(E7546S, NEB, USA) was used to prepare 1000 ng DNA samples. End-prepared DNA was ligated

121

with native barcode adapters NBD04 using Blunt/TA Ligase Master Mix (M0367S, NEB, USA).

122

Following the barcode ligation reaction, the DNA was cleaned with AMPure XP beads. The two

123

samples were then pooled to produce a 54 μl equimass pool used for adapter ligation with the ‘Native

124

Barcoding Adapter Mix (BAM). The final library was loaded onto an R9.4 flowcell (FLO-MIN106,

125

Oxford Nanopore Technologies, UK), and the run was performed on a MinION Mk1B device (ONT).

126

Genome assembly

127

Following the MinION run, reads generated were basecalled and subsequently demultiplexed using

128

Guppy GPU basecaller and barecoder (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Reads were then mapped

129

against a custom reference of SARS-CoV-2 genome comprising four Chinese and 70 early French

130

sequences using Bowtie2 (Langmead & Salzberg, 2012) and minimap2 (Heng Li, 2018). Finally, a

131

consensus genome sequence based on mapped reads was generated with bcftools consensus (H. Li,

132

2011). SARS-CoV-2 sequences were deposited on GISAID (EPI_ISL_1328819;EPI_ISL_1328821;

133

EPI_ISL_1328824; EPI_ISL_1328826).

134

Microsphere immunoassay (MIA)

135

MIA was proceeded in Maladies Infectieuses et vecteurs: Ecologie, Génétique, Evolution et Contrôle

136

(MIVEGEC). Cat serum samples were tested units using a multiplex Microsphere immunoassay

137

(MIA). 10µg of three recombinant SARS-CoV-2 antigens: nucleoprotein (N), receptor-binding

138

domain (RBD), and trimeric spike (tri-S) were used to capture specific serum antibodies whereas a

139

human protein (O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase) was used as a control antigen in the assay.

140

Distinct MagPlex microsphere sets (Luminex Corp) were respectively coupled to viral antigens using

141

the amine coupling kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The MIA

142

procedure was performed as described previously (Fritz et al., 2021). Briefly, microsphere mixtures

143

were successively incubated with serum samples (1:400) biotinylated protein A and biotinylated

144

protein G (4 µg/ml each) (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and Streptavidin-R-Phycoerythrin (4 µg/ml)

145

(Life technologies) on an orbital shaker and protected from the light. Measurements were performed

146

using a Magpix instrument (Luminex). To account for nonspecific binding of antibodies to beads,

147

Relative Fluorescence Intensities (RFI) were calculated for each sample by dividing the Mean

148

Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) signal measured for the antigen-coated microspheres by the MFI signal

149

obtained for the control microspheres. Specific seropositivity cut-off values for each antigen were set

150

at three standard deviations above the mean RFI of the 18 dogs and 14 cat serum samples sampled

151

before 2019. Based on a pre-pandemic population, MIA specificity was set at 100% for dogs and cats.

152

Neutralization activity measurement

153

Neutralization activity measurement was proceeded in Virus enveloppés, vecteurs et immunothérapie

154

(EVIR) team from CIRI. An MLV-based pseudoparticle carrying a GFP reporter pseudotyped with

155

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-CoV-2pp) was used to measure the neutralizing antibody activity

156

in cat sera. Each SARS-CoV-2 positive sample detected by MIA was processed according to a

157

neutralization procedure as previously described (Legros et al., 2021). The level of infectivity is

158

expressed as the percentage of GFP-positive cells and compared to cells infected with SARS-CoV-2pp

159

incubated without serum. Pre-pandemic sera from France was used as negative controls, and anti-

160

SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody was used as a positive control.

161

Results

162

Cat 1 was a solitary and sedentary 5-year-old female European whose only contact was with her

163

owner. Her last vaccination was 3 years prior and she was presented with no previous medical history.

164

On October 24th 2020, 10 days after her owner developed symptoms and tested positive for SARS-

165

CoV-2 infection, Cat 1 developed sneezing with non-purulent nasal secretions but no digestive trouble

166

or others notable symptoms. Five days later, on October 29, clinical examination of the cat showed

167

pink mucous membranes, a heart’s rate of 175 bpm (110bpm-200bpm), a rectal temperature of 38.4°C

168

(38°C-39°C), slight dehydration, a urea seric concentration of 0.49g/l (0.4g/l-0.6g/l), and a creatinine

169

seric concentration of 12.7mg/l (10mg/l-20mg/l). A 10-days treatment of 1 Doxybactin tablet in the

170

evening and a daily dose of Meloxoral taken over 3 days with the morning meal was then initiated. An

171

improvement of the symptoms was observed in this cat three days after the onset of the treatment.

172

Based on the owner's positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and the cat’s symptoms, a blood sample and

173

two oropharyngeal and rectal swabs were collected for further SARS-CoV-2 testing. Swabs were

174

submitted to VEBIO for RNA SARS-CoV-2 detection. The oropharyngeal swab tested positive by

175

RT-qPCR targeting the ORF1ab with a ct value of 20.41. No viral RNA was detected in the rectal

176

swabs. The virology laboratory of Caen Hospital confirmed the diagnosis following detection of viral

177

RNA in the second ororpharyngeal swab by RT-qPCR targeting gene E with a ct value of 21.43 (Table

178

1). We did not obtain a SARS-CoV-2 sequence due to the sample’s poor conservation condition prior

179

to its arrival at the lab. To detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, the cat 1 serum was analysed by

180

the MIVEGEC and EVIR teams, using MIA and retrovirus-based pseudoparticle assay. Antibodies

181

against N, RBD, and tri-S SARS-CoV-2 proteins as well as neutralizing antibodies were detected,

182

confirming productive infection in cat 1 (Table 1).

183
184

Cat 2 was a 13-year-old male European with chronic rhinitis and living with two other cats. The cat’s

185

owner, who had recently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, reported an acute deterioration in his three

186

cats’ general condition, without others details. A November 20th, 2020 clinical investigation reported

187

retro-mandibular adenopathy, and no other symptoms was observed. As with Cat 1, oropharyngeal and

188

rectal swabs were collected but with no blood sample. Similarly, VEBIO and Caen laboratories

189

detected viral RNA in both oropharyngeal swabs, with ct-values of 20.55 and 23.44, respectively

190

(Table 1). No viral RNA was detected in the rectal swabs. Again due to poor conservation of the

191

swabs prior to their arrival in our laboratory, only 5 partial fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 genome

192

could be obtained by high-throughput sequencing on RNA derived from the oropharyngeal swabs. In

193

fragment 2, we did not observe the 11288-11296 deletion characterizing 3 variants of concern (English

194

B1.1.7, South African B.1.351, and Brazilian P.1) (Table 2), indicating that this cat was not infected

195

by any of these three novel variants. Compared to the original Wuhan_Hu-1 reference sequence, we

196

observed, in fragment 4, only one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -G25563T- leading to the

197

amino acid change Q57H. This H57 mutation is widely distributed around the world and was present

198

in about 70% of the sequences reported in France between October and December 2020, according to

199

Nextstrain (https://nextstrain.org/).

200

Discussion

201

Here we report SARS-CoV-2 infection in two cats, diagnosed by molecular and serological assays,

202

and with mild clinical manifestations, including sneezing for one cat. Although we cannot definitively

203

rule out infection of the cats by an individual outside the household, the information given by

204

COVID19+ owners, including the exclusive and unique contact with its owner for cat 1 and the

205

general deterioration in the condition of all cats of the cat 2 owner, strongly suggests a transmission

206

from owners to cats.

207

Human-to-cat transmission is now widely reported worldwide, and while certainly not insignificant in

208

COVID19+ households, precise estimates of the frequency of such transmission has not been

209

established (Fritz et al., 2021; Hamer et al., 2020). To our knowledge, among the 23 papers

210

investigating possible SARS-CoV-2 infection in cats, only 14 reported PCR results confirming

211

infection in 27 cats. The present study is only the second showing molecular results of cat infection in

212

France, eight months after the first case report by Saillau et al. (Sailleau et al., 2020). It appears that

213

the majority of infections in cats are asymptomatic, but can, at times, lead to lethargy, mild respiratory

214

or digestive disease and, rarely, acute respiratory clinical signs (as observed in two cats). We report

215

here one case of mild respiratory symptoms (sneezing) in a cat, an observation consistent with

216

symptomatic infections sporadically observed in other studies. We did not observe any digestive

217

symptoms, as previously reported in a French cat. In accordance with other recent studies, our results

218

suggest that since the beginning of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, almost one year after the first report of

219

infection in a cat, the pathology in cats has not changed globally, with only a relatively small

220

proportion of cases reported as a result of clinical investigation by a veterinarian. This low

221

pathogenicity can explain the paucity of studies reporting SARS-CoV-2 infection in cats in the

222

absence of a global pet detection policy.

223

The two cats in the study were sampled during the second wave of infection in France and at the

224

beginning of the ongoing emergence of multiple novel variants. Although we did not find evidence of

225

infection by one of the three novel variants in cat 2, the emergence of these new variants raises the

226

question of potential changes in pathogenicity or transmissibility in domestic animals. This question

227

will become rapidly crucial in a very near future as the British variant, known to be much more

228

infectious, is currently removing the ancestral variant of SARS-CoV-2 in France as well in other

229

countries of Europe. Therefore, it is becoming more and more important to implement a One Health

230

approach to face SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that takes into account infection and viral circulation in pets.
