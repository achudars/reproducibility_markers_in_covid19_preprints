Glycosylation of human ACE2

Abstract
The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has created the need for
development of new therapeutic strategies. Understanding the mode of viral attachment, entry
and replication has become a key aspect of such interventions. The coronavirus surface features
a trimeric spike (S) protein that is essential for viral attachment, entry and membrane fusion. The
S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) for entry.
Herein, we describe glycomic and glycoproteomic analysis of hACE2 expressed in HEK293
human cells. We observed high glycan occupancy (73.2 to 100%) at all seven possible Nglycosylation sites and surprisingly detected one novel O-glycosylation site. To deduce the
detailed structure of glycan epitopes on hACE2 that may be involved in viral binding, we have
characterized the terminal sialic acid linkages, the presence of bisecting GlcNAc, and the pattern
of N-glycan fucosylation. We have conducted extensive manual interpretation of each
glycopeptide and glycan spectrum, in addition to using bioinformatics tools to validate the hACE2
glycosylation. Our elucidation of the site-specific glycosylation and its terminal orientations on the
hACE2 receptor, along with the modeling of hACE2 glycosylation sites can aid in understanding
the intriguing virus-receptor interactions and assist in the development of novel therapeutics to
prevent viral entry. The relevance of studying the role of ACE2 is further increased due to some
recent reports about the varying ACE2 dependent complications with regard to age, sex, race,
and pre-existing conditions of COVID-19 patients.

Glycosylation of human ACE2

Introduction
In late 2019, the emergence of the highly transmissible coronavirus disease (COVID-19) led
to a global health crisis within weeks and was soon declared a pandemic. The new underlying
pathogen belongs to the family of the coronaviridae and has been named severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), initially termed 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
(Gorbalenya, A.E., Baker, S.C., et al. 2020). More than six months into the pandemic, no
promising vaccine candidates or treatments are currently available for COVID-19 (Li, G.D. and
De Clercq, E. 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) 2020). The elucidation of key structures
involved in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will provide insights towards design and
development of suitable vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 to curb the global public health
crisis (Wang, N., Shang, J., et al. 2020).
Located on the viral surface is the spike (S) protein, which attaches the SARS-CoV-2
pathogen to target cells in the human body. The trimeric spike protein belongs to the class I fusion
proteins. Its two subunits S1 and S2 orchestrate its entry into the cell: The S1 subunit facilitates
the attachment of the virus via its receptor binding domain (RBD) to the host cell receptor, while
the S2 subunit mediates the fusion of the viral and human cellular membranes (Hoffmann, M.,
Kleine-Weber, H., et al. 2020, Shang, J., Ye, G., et al. 2020, Walls, A.C., Park, Y.J., et al. 2020).
The glycosylation pattern of the spike protein, which carries N-linked, as well as O-linked
glycosylation, has been the subject of several recent scientific studies (Shajahan, A., Supekar,
N.T., et al. 2020b, Watanabe, Y., Allen, J.D., et al. 2020, Zhang, Y., Zhao, W., et al. 2020). Insight
into the glycosylation pattern expands the understanding of the viral binding to receptors, the
fusion event, host cell entry, replication, as well as the design of suitable antigens for vaccine
development. Our recent study on the site-specific quantitation of N-linked and O-linked
glycosylation of the subunits S1 and S2 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein revealed the presence
of an O-glycosylation site at the RBD of subunit S1 (Shajahan, A., Supekar, N.T., et al. 2020b),

Glycosylation of human ACE2
although Watanabe et al. (9) reported lower abundances of O-linked glycans on the full-length
spike protein. A number of amino acids within the RBD have been shown to be crucial
determinants for binding in general and the binding affinity in particular of the virus to the host cell
receptors (Andersen, K.G., Rambaut, A., et al. 2020, Wan, Y., Shang, J., et al. 2020). Several
studies have identified the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2, ACEH) as the key
virus receptor of SARS-CoV-1 in the early 2000s (Kuba, K., Imai, Y., et al. 2005, Li, W., Moore,
M.J., et al. 2003). Moreover, hACE2 was identified recently as the receptor for cell entry of SARSCoV-2 (Hoffmann, M., Kleine-Weber, H., et al. 2020, Zhou, P., Yang, X.L., et al. 2020). However,
the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 pathogens exploit the hACE2 receptor for cell entry only,
which is unrelated to its physiological function (Li, F. 2013).
hACE2 is a type-I transmembrane protein and includes an extracellular, a transmembrane,
and a cytosolic domain within a total of 805 amino acids (Jiang, F., Yang, J., et al. 2014).
Interestingly, it has been found that the transmembrane form can be cleaved to a soluble form of
hACE2 (sACE2) that lacks the transmembrane and cytosolic domains but is enzymatically active,
since the catalytic site, as well as the zinc-binding motif lie within the extracellular region (Tipnis,
S.R., Hooper, N.M., et al. 2000). hACE2 is secreted by endothelial cells and is involved in the
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) (Donoghue, M., Hsieh, F., et al. 2000).
The presence of N-glycosylation was experimentally verified by treatment with the
endoglycosidase PNGase F and monitoring the shift in the gel migration of hACE2 to the predicted
molecular mass of ∼85 kDa. (Li, W., Moore, M.J., et al. 2003, Tipnis, S.R., Hooper, N.M., et al.
2000). An earlier analysis on hACE2 N-linked glycans via sequential exoglycosidase digestion
and HPLC after 2-aminobenzamide labeling identified mainly biantennary N-linked glycans with
sialylation and core fucosylation, along with sialylated tri- and tetra-antennary N-glycans. A
preprint and a patent have described glycoproteomics of hACE2 on non-human cells. However,
glycosylation on such systems is not expected to reflect what is found in human ACE2 (Schuster,

M., Loibner, H., et al. 2013, Sun, Z., Ren, K., et al. 2020). Nevertheless, we could not find any
reports with detailed structure elucidation of hACE2 glycans, even on multiplatform glycosylation
resource glygen.org (Chen, R., Jiang, X., et al. 2009, Kristiansen, T.Z., Bunkenborg, J., et al.
2004, Towler, P., Staker, B., et al. 2004, York, W.S., Mazumder, R., et al. 2020). The study of
glycosylation can help in understanding the key roles glycans play during the physiological
function of hACE2 and more importantly, its involvement in facilitating viral binding.
Within this study, we report the quantitative site-specific N-linked and O-linked glycan
characterization of hACE2 by a glycomic and glycoproteomic approach. We identified
glycosylation at all seven potential N-glycosylation sites on hACE2 and also report one Oglycosylation site. The N- and O-glycans were released from hACE2 and structurally
characterized by MALDI-MS and ESI-MSn. Particular focus was placed upon the location of
fucosylation, the presence of bisecting GlcNAc residues, and the linkages of sialic acids.

Results
Implication of glycosylation on hACE2 binding with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 S
protein.
We examined the co-crystallization structures of SARS-CoV-1 S protein trimer with hACE2
(PDB ID - 6ACG) and SARS-CoV-2 RBD with hACE2 dimer (PDB ID - 6M17) to understand the
binding location of S protein with hACE2 and the proximity of glycosylation sites (Song, W., Gui,
M., et al. 2018, Yan, R., Zhang, Y., et al. 2020). Recently, it was reported that a dimeric ACE2
can accommodate two S protein trimers, each through a monomer of ACE2 (Yan, R., Zhang, Y.,
et al. 2020). The binding location of individual monomers of the S protein with each monomer of
the hACE2 dimer is shown in Figure 1. The image indicates that the N-glycosylation and its
epitopes, particularly at sites N90 and N322, could play a critical role in the binding of hACE2 to
the RBD of S protein. Our recent study on the glycosylation of individual S protein subunits

Glycosylation of human ACE2
(Shajahan, A., Supekar, N.T., et al. 2020b) showed the prevalence of high mannose type glycans
at the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (N331 and N343), while the results of Watanabe et al.
on trimeric S protein (Watanabe, Y., Allen, J.D., et al. 2020) indicated a predominance of complex
glycans at these sites. The relevance of the different types of glycans and their implication on the
receptor binding needs further investigation.
We evaluated the proximity of the N-glycans to the peptidase activity and inhibitor binding
sites of hACE2 (Figure 1). Inspection of the co-crystallization structure of hACE2 (PDB ID – 1R4L)
with its inhibitor shows that the inhibitor is bound inside the cleft formed by the two monomers of
ACE2, which is also the site of peptidase enzymatic activity (Towler, P., Staker, B., et al. 2004).
The RBD-binding region with its N-glycans, on the other hand, is located outside the cleft, nearly
on the opposite face of each ACE2 monomer, as shown in Figure 1.
Mapping N-glycosylation on hACE2
For the amino acid numbering we have followed the numbering used in UniProt [Q9BYF1]
and the literature, although the numbering differs from that of the recombinant hACE2 we used
for the study, which is missing the 1-17 signal peptide. Initially, we conducted a combination of
trypsin and chymotrypsin digests to map the N-glycosylation on hACE2. Even though all the sites
were covered by this digestion, the glycoform assignment at site N53 was ambiguous, as the
peptide + HexNAc fragment (Y1 ion) was missing from the spectra. Thus, we conducted a
combination of GluC and chymotrypsin digestion to characterize the N-glycosylation at site N53.
To ensure whether the detected glycans were indeed derived from ACE2, we searched the LCMS/MS data of the ACE2 digest against the complete human UniProt database (downloaded on
Aug.2018) and validated that hACE2 was the most abundant protein in the digest with a log
probability value of 511.82, while the second abundant protein had a log probability value of 83.49
(Table S2). Beside ACE2, no other detected proteins showed presence of glycopeptide spectra
with acceptable fragment ions. We observed substantial (73.2 to 100 % total site occupancy rate)

Glycosylation of human ACE2
glycan occupancy at all seven predicted N-glycosylation sites of hACE2 (Figures 2, 3, and S1S7). While sites N53, N90, N103, N322, N546 showed no unglycosylated peptides, sites N432
and N690 were 26.8 % and 1.1 % unoccupied, respectively. Complex-type, biantennary glycans
were much more abundant than high-mannose and hybrid type glycans across all N-glycosylation
sites. We discovered highly processed sialylated, complex-type bi-antennary, tri-antennary and
tetra-antennary glycans on all sites (Figures 2 and 3). Contrasting sialylation and glycan extension
patterns were observed among the N-glycosylation sites. Site N53 featured predominantly
sialylated and extended complex type glycans, whereas sites N90, N103, N322, and N546 carried
abundant non-sialylated, bianntennary structures. Sites N432 and N690 were occupied with
sialylated and non-sialylated N-glycans of almost equal abundance. All sites showed high levels
of mono-fucosylated glycans.
The N-glycan structures at each site were confirmed by the presence of characteristic peptide
fragments, glycan oxonium ions and neutral losses, in addition to high resolution precursor mass
determination (Figures 4A, S1-S7, Table S2).
MS fragmentation of glycopeptides by collision-induced dissociation (CID) preferentially
dissociates glycans while generating few peptide backbone fragments, which complicates the
identification of peptide sequences. Moreover, low m/z signature ions of glycopeptides, such as
glycan oxonium ions may not be detected in the CID MS/MS spectra. Conversely, HCD enables
detection of small diagnostic oxonium ions of monosaccharides and the peptide backbone while
preserving labile modifications at the glycan cores (Cao, L., Qu, Y., et al. 2016). Thus, by
employing tandem HCD and CID fragmentation we obtained a wide spectrum of characteristic
fragments of glycopeptides such as oxonium ions, peptide fragments, core glycan-peptide
fragments (Y1, Y2 ions) and glycan neutral loss fragments (Figure 4A).

Glycosylation of human ACE2
Through a glycoproteomics approach, we have identified, one O-glycosylation site on hACE2
by searching the LC-MS/MS data for common O-glycosylation modifications. We have observed
very strong evidence for the presence of O-glycosylation at site Thr730 on peptide
LGIQPTLGPPNQP, as the precursor masses, oxonium ions, neutral losses, and peptides
fragments (b and y ions) were detected with high mass accuracy (Figures 2, 3, 4B, and S8, Table
S2).
The Core-1 mucin type O-glycan GalNAcGalNeuAc2 was observed as the predominant
glycan on site Thr730 (Figures 2, 3, and 4B). Almost 97 % of the peptide with Thr730 was
occupied by O-glycan GalNAcGalNeuAc2 (Figures 3, 4B, and S8). Even though we observed
minor peak of O-glycan corresponding to GalNAcGalNeuAc in the chromatogram, we did not
consider that for the calculation since such structure can be generated by in-source
fragmentation.
Comparison of glycosylation sites of human ACE2 with other related species.
We aligned the amino acid sequence of human, bat, pig, cat, mouse, rabbit, Malayan pangolin,
and chicken ACE2 and compared the N-glycosylation sites among these species. This is shown
schematically in Figure 5. Whilst displaying overall sequence similarities of about 53 percent,
human ACE2 possesses 7, bat (Chinese rufous horseshoe bat) ACE2 also 7, cat ACE2 a total
of 9, porcine ACE2 8, murine ACE2 only 6, rabbit ACE2 8, pangolin ACE2 7, and chicken ACE2
10 potential N-glycosylation sites. Our sequence alignment studies showed that in human ACE2,
five N-glycosylation sites share similarities with bat ACE2, but only three N-glycosylation sites
share similarities with mouse ACE2, which is not susceptible to SARS-CoV-1 binding. Pig ACE2
showed four similar sites with human, whereas cat ACE2 showed five sites that are similar (Figure
5). Based on recent reports, human, bat, cat, rabbit, and pangolin ACE2 exhibit binding affinity to
SARS-CoV-2 viral RBD, while pig, mouse, and chicken ACE2 do not bind (Shi, J., Wen, Z., et al.
2020, Zhao, X., Chen, D., et al. 2020). Overall alignment of N-glycosylation sites among all these

Glycosylation of human ACE2
8 species indicate that site N90 is the site that stands out among the susceptible and nonsusceptible species. The susceptible species have an N90 glycosylation site, whereas the nonsusceptible species do not. Interestingly, site N90 is closer to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding
domain of ACE2 with respect to other sites, as there are reports indicating that abrogation of N90
glycosylation enhances the RBD binding with ACE2 (Procko, E. 2020, Stawiski, E.W., Diwanji,
D., et al. 2020). Site N322 which is proximal to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding domain is aligned
in human, bat, cat, pig and chicken but pig and chicken among them are non-susceptible.
N- and O- glycomics analysis on hACE2
N- and O-glycomic studies of the hACE2 receptor were performed by methods described
previously (Shajahan, A., Heiss, C., et al. 2017). Briefly, N-glycans were released by treating the
reduced and alkylated hACE2 protein with the endoglycosidase PNGase F. The released Nglycans were separated by passage through a C18 solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge, and
de-N-glycosylated proteins on the cartridges were eluted with 80% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic
acid. The O-linked glycans were then released from hACE2 by reductive β-elimination. The
released N- and O- glycan fractions were then permethylated, a derivatization method that, in
addition to increasing sensitivity, allows for further structural and linkage characterization via MSn
fragmentation. Moreover, permethylation allows unambiguous assignment of monosaccharide
topology such as core and antennae fucosylation as it prevents monosaccharide migration or
rearrangement at gaseous phase during collisional dissociation (Wuhrer, M., Deelder, A.M., et al.
2011). The permethylated N- and O- glycans were evaluated by MALDI-MS and the structures
were assigned by ESI-MSn performed through direct infusion (Figures 6, 7, S9-S11).
Sequencing of the N-glycans obtained from hACE2 by MALDI-MS and ESI-MSn indicated a
highly diverse pool of glycoforms comprised of high mannose, hybrid, and complex-type
structures (Figures 6 and S9, Table 1). The glycans were predominantly of the complex type and
were primarily (~60%) biantennary, with triantennary and quaternary structures also present in

Glycosylation of human ACE2
significant amounts. More than 85% of the structures were fucosylated, and roughly half of the
structures were sialylated. The glycomics results corroborate with the glycoproteomics results
except that few minor glycoforms present on the glycomics data were not annotated to the Nglycosylation sites of ACE2 because of the lack of their MS2 scans on the LC-MS/MS data. The
glycan structures were annotated based on high resolution precursor mass, ESI-MSn
fragmentation and the common biosynthetic pathways of mammalian N-glycans (Figure S11).
Core versus antennal fucosylation on hACE2 N-glycans
MS/MS sequencing of the observed N-glycans was conducted with an automated top-down
program, collecting MS2 spectra of the highest intensity peaks with CID. This helped confirm
overall structure (for example hybrid forms versus complex type) and determine placement of the
fucose. We observed that, while most of the fucosylated structures were primarily core-fucose,
small amounts of the same glycoform appeared to be fucosylated on the antennae (Figure 7A).
This can be determined by a diagnostic terminal GalGlcNAcFuc fragment of m/z 660 [M+Na+],
which corresponds to the fragmentation of the antenna (Figure 7A) appearing as a b-ion. The
corresponding y-ion m/z 1402 [M+Na+] is also found, confirming this structure. Additional
glycoforms displaying two fucoses (core and antennal) were also observed among these
structures (Figure 6, Table 1).
Identifying the sialic acid linkages on hACE2 N-glycans by ESI-MSn
A separate MSn procedure was used to determine the linkages of sialic acids in the complextype N-glycans in hACE2. The method, which uses direct infusion of the permethylated glycans
in a lithium carbonate and methanol solution, causes sequential fragmentation of the sialylated
arms of a complex-type N-glycan, down to the galactose monosaccharide residue, which carries
different methyl substitution, depending on the position through which it was linked to sialic acid
in the glycan. The methyl substitution is then determined by analysis of the cross-ring fragments

produced from the galactose monosaccharide ion. The cross-ring fragments obtained from the
fragmentation of hACE2 glycans using this MS5 method (Anthony, R.M., Nimmerjahn, F., et al.
2008, Shajahan, A., Supekar, N.T., et al. 2020a) provided diagnostic ions corresponding to 2→3
or 2→6 linked sialic acids (Figures 7B and S9). While the spectra demonstrated a predominance
of fragments indicating 2→3 linked sialylated N-glycans, most structures also showed evidence
for minor presence of 2→6 linked sialic acid. No N-glycan was found to solely contain 2→6 linked
sialic acids.
Determination of bisecting GlcNAc on hACE2 N-glycans by ESI-MSn
To determine presence of bisecting GlcNAc, an MSn strategy to trim down the permethylated
N-glycan to the trimannose core was utilized (Ashline, D.J., Duk, M., et al. 2015, Shajahan, A.,
Supekar, N.T., et al. 2020a). Fragmentation to the core yields a 3-substituted structure at m/z 852
[M+Na+], that could correspond to either a triantennary structure or a biantennary structure with a
bisecting GlcNAc. Fragmentation of this ion yields an m/z of 444 [M+Na+] for bisecting structures
or m/z 458 [M+Na+] for triantennary glycans. As shown in Figure 7C, both m/zs of 444 and 458
were observed, indicating that both triantennary and bisecting structures were present in this
sample. This supports earlier findings by Zhao et al. who reported both bisecting and higher-order
complex-type glycans (Zhao, X., Guo, F., et al. 2015).
Detection and confirmation of O-glycans by MALDI-MS and ESI-MSn
The released O-glycans from hACE2 were sequenced by both MALDI-MS and ESI-MSn after
permethylation (Figures 7D and S10). The signal intensity was very low, and mostly the
disialylated Core-1 O-glycan structure was observed. This is supported by our O-glycoproteomics
findings, which showed that O-glycosylation occurred only on one site, disialylated Core-1 was
the major glycoform. The MS2 fragmentation of the O-glycan confirms its structure as a sialylated
Core-1 O-glycan (Figure 7D).

Glycosylation of human ACE2

Discussion
hACE2 acts as a receptor for human coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, as well
as human coronavirus NL63/HCoV-NL63 (Hoffmann, M., Kleine-Weber, H., et al. 2020, Hofmann,
H., Pyrc, K., et al. 2005, Li, W., Moore, M.J., et al. 2003). Recent evidence indicates that the
molecular and structural features of SARS-CoV-2 RBD result in stronger hACE2 binding
compared to the earlier virus SARS-CoV-1 (Andersen, K.G., Rambaut, A., et al. 2020, Hoffmann,
M., Kleine-Weber, H., et al. 2020).
According to recent cryo-EM studies on SARS-CoV-2, the binding of S protein to the hACE2
receptor primarily involves extensive polar residue interactions between RBD and the peptidase
domain of hACE2 (Hoffmann, M., Kleine-Weber, H., et al. 2020, Walls, A.C., Park, Y.J., et al.
2020). The RBD located in the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 S protein undergoes a hinge-like
dynamic movement that enhances the capture of the spike protein RBD with hACE2 (Wrapp, D.,
Wang, N., et al. 2020). This enhanced affinity for the human ACE2 receptor is predicted to be 10–
20-fold higher for SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV-1, which may be responsible for the increased
transmissibility of the new virus (Wrapp, D., Wang, N., et al. 2020, Yan, R., Zhang, Y., et al. 2020).
The protease domain of ACE2 interacts with the RBD of coronaviruses, and thus soluble ACE2
(sACE2), which is devoid of neck and transmembrane domains are capable of binding with RBD,
neutralizing infection (Hofmann, H., Geier, M., et al. 2004, Yan, R., Zhang, Y., et al. 2020).
ACE2 is expressed in most vertebrates. The ACE2 variants from human, bat, domestic pig,
domestic cat, mouse, rabbit, and pangolin are all composed of 805 amino acid residues (Figure
5), whereas chicken ACE2 contains 808 amino acids. SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 can infect
a wide variety of organisms, including but not limited to humans, palm civets, cats and bats. In
vitro virus infectivity studies conducted by Zhou el al indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is able to exploit
the ACE2 proteins from humans, bats, pigs and civets to infect the cell cultures expressing the

respective receptor. However, a cell culture expressing murine ACE2 was not infected (Zhou, P.,
Yang, X.L., et al. 2020). This is based on varying degrees of receptor recognition. Receptor
recognition is largely determined by two factors, (i) the binding specificity and (ii) the binding
affinity of the RBD of the virus’s spike protein to the cell entry receptor ACE2. This attachment
step has been identified as a crucial limiting step for infection, as well as cross-species infection
(Hou, Y., Peng, C., et al. 2010, Li, F. 2013). Our comparison of N-glycosylation sites across
species indicated that human ACE shares several glycosylation sites with other species. Studying
the correlation between glycosylation sites on ACE2 of different species and their susceptibility to
viral binding can help in understanding the key sites involved (Figure 5). According to the data
published by Qiu et al, the overall sequence identity of the ACE2 between different organisms
and the hACE2 cannot be directly translated into prediction of transmissibility (Qiu, Y., Zhao, Y.B.,
et al. 2020). For example, mouse ACE2 matches with a higher sequence similarity than bat and
pig, but the murine ACE2 cannot be exploited by the coronavirus, the study found (Qiu, Y., Zhao,
Y.B., et al. 2020).This indicates the possibility of involvement of glycosylation sites, glycans and
glycan terminal epitopes in dictating the binding affinity of coronavirus RBD with ACE2. Our
sequence analysis of ACE2 among different species draws attention to the correlation of
glycosylation at site N90 with susceptibility, N90 being a site proximal to viral RBD binding
(Figures 1, 2B, and 5).
A recent in silico study by Stawiski et al (Stawiski, E.W., Diwanji, D., et al. 2020) predicted
that glycosylation at N90 is an important modification that partly disrupts the interaction of the
coronavirus with the ACE2 receptor (Figures 1 and 2B). Therefore, mutation at either N90 or T92
removes the glycosylation motif and makes the unglycosylated variant prone to interactions with
SARS-CoV-2. The deleterious effect of N90 glycosylation upon binding to S protein has been
experimentally confirmed by Procko (Procko, E. 2020). Also, the elucidation of the structure of
murine ACE2 would be beneficial for the investigation of insusceptible organisms. It might, in turn,

Glycosylation of human ACE2
provide valuable insight into the molecular structures that make humans prone to infection with
SARS-CoV-2 via hACE2. A previous co-crystallization study of hACE2 with its inhibitor indicates
that the spike protein RBD binding region of hACE2 is distal to the surface that binds with the
ACE2 inhibitors, suggesting that the use of ACE2 inhibitors may not be beneficial in preventing
viral binding (Figure 1) (Towler, P., Staker, B., et al. 2004). Binding of ACE2 receptor inhibitors
ultimately upregulates ACE2 receptor synthesis, resulting in an increase of available binding sites
for SARS-CoV-2, leading to increased chances of COVID-19 infection (Rico-Mesa, J.S., White,
A., et al. 2020).
O-glycosylation is initiated by the -glycosidic attachment of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)
to the hydroxyl group of serine or threonine, and mucin type O-glycosylation is the most common
type in higher eukaryotes (Brockhausen, I. and Stanley, P. 2015, Van den Steen, P., Rudd, P.M.,
et al. 1998). O-glycans are involved in protein stability and function, and have been suggested to
play roles in mediating pathogenic binding with human receptors (Mayr, J., Lau, K., et al. 2018).
Our analysis confirmed the presence of O-glycosylation at site Thr730 unambiguously (Figures
2, 3, 4, and 7D). The frequency of occurrence of proline residues is higher adjacent to Oglycosylation sites and, in accordance with this general rule, the O-glycosylation site Thr730 was
adjacent to a proline at site Pro729 (Thanka Christlet, T.H. and Veluraja, K. 2001).
Our data indicate that Thr730 is fully O-glycosylated, which could have implications in the
ACE2 shedding after SARS-CoV-1 and CoV-2 infection. It has been demonstrated that inhibition
of ADAM17 (ACE2 sheddase) leads to decreased ACE2 shedding, which may have a protective
effect against SARS-CoV infection by reducing the viral load, possibly by preventing fusion of viral
particles with cytoplasmic membranes (Haga, S., Yamamoto, N., et al. 2008, Palau, V., Riera, M.,
et al. 2020). It was shown that TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE), ADAM17, and the sequence
of ACE2 C-terminus are involved in SARS-S-induced ACE2 shedding, and these could be targets
for anti-SARS-CoV therapeutics (Haga, S., Yamamoto, N., et al. 2008). Studies indicate that the

Glycosylation of human ACE2
cleavage site for the ADAM17-induced ectodomain shedding of ACE2 is localized within the
juxtamembrane region amino acids 716 and 741, although a later study showed that Arg708 and
Ser709 is involved with ACE2 shedding (Jia, H.P., Look, D.C., et al. 2009, Lai, Z.W., Hanchapola,
I., et al. 2011). Our observation of O-glycosylation at Thr730 could facilitate future studies to
understand the roles of glycosylation on the juxtamembrane region of ACE2 and its shedding.
One may speculate that the bulky and hydrophilic glycosylation at Thr730 in the juxtamembrane
region, just outside the cell membrane, could play a role in the dimerization and presenting of
ACE2 on the cell surface.
Human and avian virus hemagglutinins (HAs), including that of the 2009 pandemic H1N1,
bind glycans with sulfation, fucosylation and internal sialylation (Chandrasekaran, A., Srinivasan,
A., et al. 2008, Mayr, J., Lau, K., et al. 2018). The human pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses shift
the preference from avian-like α2→3-linkages to α2→6-linkages during the switch to infect
humans, and a characteristic structural topology of glycans is also required for the specific binding
of HA to α2→6 sialylated glycans (Chandrasekaran, A., Srinivasan, A., et al. 2008). The sialylated
Core-1 glycoforms are involved in the life cycle of the influenza A virus and play a crucial role
during infection (Mayr, J., Lau, K., et al. 2018). The full-length S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV-1 share almost 76% identity in amino acid sequences, whereas the N-terminal
domains (NTDs) show only 53.5% homology. The NTDs of different coronavirus S proteins bind
with varying avidity to different sugars, and the NTD of MERS-CoV prefers α2→3-linked sialic
acid over α2→6-linked sialic acid with sulfated sialyl-Lewis X (with antennal fucose) being the
preferred binding motif (Li, W., Hulswit, R.J.G., et al. 2017, Park, Y.J., Walls, A.C., et al. 2019).
Nevertheless, we observed a relatively higher level of 2→3 linked sialylated N-glycans on hACE2,
and thus the sialic acid linkage could favor the binding of coronavirus S proteins (Figure 7B).
S glycoproteins of coronaviruses HCoV-OC43 and Bat CoV mediate attachment to
oligosaccharide receptors by interacting with 9-O-acetyl-sialic acid (Tortorici, M.A., Walls, A.C.,

Glycosylation of human ACE2
et al. 2019). No sialic acid binding preference of SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 has been reported,
and whether the sialic acid linkages on the hACE2 receptor affect virus entry remains to be
determined. We have searched for 9-O-acetyl-sialic acid on the hACE2 glycans by extracting the
masses of its oxonium ions on the LC-MS/MS spectra but could not detect any evidence for its
presence. The expression of 9-O-acetyl-sialic acid depends on the expression level of the sialate
O-acetyltransferase gene (CasD1), and only 1 to 2% of total sialic acid is 9-O-acetylated in
HEK293 cells (Barnard, K.N., Wasik, B.R., et al. 2019). This could be the reason for the lack of
9-O-acetyl-sialic acid on the glycans from hACE2 we used for this study, as it is produced from
HEK293 cells. We have detected both core fucosylation and antennal fucosylation on hACE2 Nglycans (Figure 7A). Moreover, we found evidence of bisecting GlcNAc on the hACE2 N-glycans
(Figure 7C). The discovery of such glycan epitopes of hACE2 provides a better understanding of
viral binding preferences and can guide the research for the development of suitable therapeutics.
Our N- and O- glycosylation characterization of hACE2 expressed in a human cell system
through both glycoproteomics and glycomics can help future studies in understanding the roles
glycans play in the function and pathogen binding of hACE2. We have conducted extensive
manual interpretation for the assignment of each glycopeptide, glycan and linkage structures in
order to eliminate false detections. We are currently exploring the protein polymorphism on
hACE2 and how the glycosylation profile varies in the variants which alter the glycosylation sites
as it is reported that natural ACE2 variants that are predicted to alter the virus-host interaction
and thereby potentially alter host susceptibility (Stawiski, E.W., Diwanji, D., et al. 2020).
Detailed glycan analysis is important for the development of hACE2 or sACE2-based
therapeutics which are suggested as a therapeutic measure to neutralize the viral pathogens
(Hofmann, H., Geier, M., et al. 2004, Yan, R., Zhang, Y., et al. 2020). Evaluation of glycosylation
on glycoprotein therapeutics produced from various human and non-human expression systems
is critical from the point of view of immunogenicity, stability, as well as therapeutic efficacy (Beck,

Glycosylation of human ACE2
A., Cochet, O., et al. 2010, Sola, R.J. and Griebenow, K. 2010). Studies indicate that although
children generally express more ACE2 than adults, they tend to experience milder symptoms of
COVID-19, raising the question whether the glycosylation profile of hACE2 changes with age
(Ciaglia, E., Vecchione, C., et al. 2020). Recent reports on COVID-19 infection of children, the
triggering of severe cardiac problems, and protection observed in asthma patients necessitates
the study on disease etiology and the contribution of hACE2 receptors (Hofmann, H., Simmons,
G., et al. 2006, Jackson, D.J., Busse, W.W., et al. 2020). The understanding of complex sialylated
N-glycans and sialylated mucin type O-glycans, on hACE2, along with their linkage and structural
isomerism provides the basic structural knowledge that is useful for elucidating their interaction
with viral surface protein and can aid in future therapeutic possibilities.

Materials and methods
Materials
Dithiothreitol (DTT), iodoacetamide (IAA), and iodomethane were purchased from Sigma
Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Sequencing-grade modified trypsin, chymotrypsin and GluC were
purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Peptide-N-Glycosidase F (PNGase F) was purchased
from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich
unless indicated otherwise. Data analysis was performed using Byonic 2.3.5 software and
manually using Thermo Fisher Xcalibur 4.2. The purified human angiotensin converting enzyme
hACE2 (Cat. No. 230-30165) was purchased from RayBiotech (Atlanta, GA).
Experimental Design and Statistical Rationale
We have procured recombinant hACE2 receptor expressed on human HEK293 cells. The
protein was expressed with a C-terminal His tag and comprises residues Gln18 to Ser740. We
performed a combination of trypsin (1:20 enzyme protein ratio) and chymotrypsin (1:20 enzyme
protein ratio) digestion on reduced and alkylated hACE2 and generated glycopeptides, each

containing a single N-linked glycan site (based on in silico digestion). In order to map the site N53
unambiguously we conducted sequential digest of reduced/alkylated hACE2 with GluC (1:20
enzyme protein ratio) and chymotrypsin (1:20 enzyme protein ratio). The glycopeptides were
directly subjected to two injections of high-resolution LC-MS/MS, using a glycan oxonium ion
product dependent HCD triggered CID program. The dynamic exclusion was enabled for the data
dependent scan while ensuring acquisition of at least two MS2 fragmentations of each peak. The
LC-MS/MS data were analyzed using a Byonic (version 2.3.5) software search, each glycopeptide
annotation was screened thoroughly manually for the b and y ions, glycan oxonium ions and
neutral losses, and false detections were eliminated. We have quantified the relative intensities
of glycans at each site by evaluating the area under the curve of each extracted glycopeptide
peak in the LC-MS chromatogram.
For the glycomics analysis, the permethylated N- and O- glycans were analyzed by both
MALDI-MS and high-resolution direct infusion ESI-MSn. Multiple scans were acquired, masses of
glycans with less than 5 ppm accuracy were considered, and each structure was assigned based
on MSn data acquired at high resolution except for the MS4-6 experiments, where the acquisition
was conducted in the ion trap (IT). The glycomics data analysis was performed manually with the
help of GlycoWorkbench software. Deconvolution of the spectra to the molecular mass was
conducted by using Thermo Fisher FreeStyle 1.4 software.
Reduction, alkylation and protease digestion of hACE2 for glycoproteomics
The purified hACE2 (20 µg) expressed on HEK293 cells in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate
solution was reduced by adding 25 mM DTT and incubating at 60 °C for 30 min. The protein was
further alkylated by the addition of 90 mM IAA and incubating at RT for 30 min in the dark.
Subsequently, the protein was desalted using a 10-kDa centrifuge filter and digested by
sequential treatment with trypsin and chymotrypsin or GluC and chymotrypsin by incubating for

Glycosylation of human ACE2
18 h at 37 °C during each digestion step. The digest was filtered through a 0.2-µm filter and
directly analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
N- and O-linked glycan release, purification, and permethylation
N- and O-linked glycans were released by following the methods described previously
(Shajahan, A., Heiss, C., et al. 2017). N-linked glycans were released from about 80 µg of reduced
and alkylated (as mentioned previously) hACE2 sample by treatment with PNGase F at 37˚C for
16 h. The released N-glycans were isolated by passing the digest through a C18 SPE cartridge
with a 5% acetic acid solution (3 mL) and dried by lyophilization.
The remaining de-N-glycosylated hACE2 protein, still containing O-glycans was then eluted
from the column using 80% aqueous acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (3 mL). The O-glycans
were released from the peptide backbone by reductive β-elimination (Shajahan, A., Heiss, C., et
al. 2017). The eluted hACE2 was treated with a solution of 19 mg/500 µL of sodium borohydride
in a solution of 50 mM sodium hydroxide. The solution was heated to 45 ˚C for 16 h and
neutralized with a solution of 10% acetic acid. The sample was desalted on a hand-packed ion
exchange resin (DOWEX H+) by eluting with 5% acetic acid and dried by lyophilization. The
borates were removed by the addition of a solution of methanol:acetic acid (9:1) and evaporation
under a steam of nitrogen.
The released N- and O-linked glycans were then permethylated using methods described
elsewhere (Shajahan, A., Heiss, C., et al. 2017).
Data acquisition of protein digest samples using nano-LC-MS/MS
The glycoprotein digests were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer
equipped with a nanospray ion source and connected to a Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano nano-LC
system (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). A pre-packed nano-LC column (Cat. No. 164568, Thermo
Fisher, Waltham, MA) of 15 cm length with 75 µm internal diameter (id), filled with 3-µm C18

material (reverse phase) was used for chromatographic separation of samples. The precursor ion
scan was acquired at 120,000 resolution in the Orbitrap analyzer, and precursors at a time frame
of 3 s were selected for subsequent MS/MS fragmentation in the Orbitrap analyzer at 15,000
resolution. The LC-MS/MS runs of each digest were conducted for 180 min in order to separate
the glycopeptides. The threshold for triggering an MS/MS event was set to 1000 counts, and
monoisotopic precursor selection was enabled. MS/MS fragmentation was conducted with
stepped HCD (higher-energy collisional dissociation) product triggered CID (collision-induced
dissociation) (HCDpdCID) program. For product triggering, the HexNAc fragment m/z 204.087
detected within 10 ppm was chosen as a criteria to trigger the fragment-dependent CID
acquisition. Charge state screening was enabled, and precursors with unknown charge state or
a charge state of +1 were excluded (positive ion mode). Dynamic exclusion was also enabled
(exclusion duration of 30 s).
Data analysis of glycoproteins
The LC-MS/MS spectra of the combined tryptic /chymotryptic digest of hACE2 were searched
against the FASTA sequence of hACE2 (UniProt ID: Q9BYF1, modified according to expressed
protein) using the Byonic software by choosing peptide cleavage sites ‘RKFWYL’ for trypsinchymotrypsin digestion and ‘EFWYL’ for GluC-chymotrypsin digestion (semi-specific cleavage
option enabled). Precursor tolerance of 5 ppm and fragment tolerance of 10 ppm was chosen for
the search with three missed cleavage option enabled. Oxidation of methionine, deamidation of
asparagine and glutamine, and possible common human N-glycans (common human 182 Nglycans) and O-glycan masses (common human six O-glycans) were used as variable
modifications. The bad spectra were skipped, and 1 % FDR was enabled while choosing manual
score cut-off value of zero. The LC-MS/MS spectra were also analyzed manually for the
glycopeptides with the support of the Thermo Fisher Xcalibur 4.2 software. The HCDpdCID MS2
spectra of glycopeptides were evaluated for the glycan neutral loss pattern, oxonium ions and

glycopeptide fragmentations to assign the sequence and the presence of glycans in the
glycopeptides. The relative intensities of glycans at each site were calculated by evaluating the
area under the curve of each extracted glycopeptide peak (after deconvolution using Xtract
module of Xcalibur 4.2 Qual Browser) on the LC-MS chromatogram.
N- and O-linked glycomic profiling by MALDI-MS
The permethylated N- and O-glycans were dissolved in 20 µL of methanol. A 0.5-µL portion
of sample was mixed with an equal volume of DHB matrix solution (10 mg/mL in 1:1 methanolwater) and spotted on to a MALDI plate. MALDI-MS spectra were acquired in positive ion and
reflector mode using an AB Sciex 5800 MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometer.
N- and O-linked glycomic profiling by DI-ESI-MSn
A solution of the permethylated N-glycans from hACE2 was diluted into a solution of 1 mM
sodium hydroxide/50% MeOH and directly infused (0.5 µL/min) into an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid
mass spectrometer equipped with a nanospray ion source. An automated program was used to
collect a full MS then MS2 of the highest-intensity peaks. The top 300 peaks collected from a m/z
range of 800-2000 were fragmented by CID, with a dynamic exclusion of 60 s. The total run time
was 20 min. The full MS was collected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 120,000, while the MS2
spectra were collected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000. A similar automated program was
used for the collection of O-glycan data with a m/z range adjusted to 600-1600.
Original glycoform assignments were made based on full-mass molecular weight. Additional
structural details were determined by MSn and modeling with the GlycoWorkbench 2 software.
Sialic Acid Linkage Analysis by IT-MS spectrometry including MSn fragmentation
A solution of the permethylated N-glycans from hACE2 was diluted into a solution of 1 mM
lithium carbonate/50% MeOH and directly infused (0.5 µL/min) into an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid

mass spectrometer equipped with a nanospray ion source. The sialic acid-containing N-glycans
(determined by MALDI-TOF-MS and ESI-MSn experiments) were probed with MSn analysis
described previously (Anthony, R.M., Nimmerjahn, F., et al. 2008, Lin, N., Mascarenhas, J., et al.
2015, Shajahan, A., Supekar, N.T., et al. 2017). Isolation was conducted in the quadrupole, while
detection was conducted in the IT. The isolation width of each fragmentation was 2 mass units,
and the maximum injection time was 100 ms. More than 300 spectra were collected for each
glycoform, which were then spectrally averaged.
Determination of bisecting GlcNAc by IT-MS spectrometry including MSn fragmentation
A solution of the permethylated N-glycans from hACE2 was diluted into a solution of 1 mM
sodium hydroxide/50% MeOH and directly infused (0.5 µL/min) into an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid
mass spectrometer equipped with a nanospray ion source. The neutral complex-type N-glycans
(determined by MALDI-TOF-MS and ESI-MSn experiments) were probed with MSn analysis
described previously (Ashline, D.J., Duk, M., et al. 2015). Because of the extra fragmentation
steps, sialylated N-glycans were not probed since they yielded too low of a signal. Isolation was
conducted in the quadrupole while detection was conducted in the IT. The isolation width of each
fragmentation was 2 mass units, and the maximum injection time was 100 ms. More than 300
spectra were collected for each glycoform, which were then spectrally averaged.

Glycosylation of human ACE2

Legends to figures
Figure 1: Co-crystallization structure of SARS-CoV-1 trimer with hACE2 (PDB ID – 6ACG) and SARS-CoV-2 RBD
with hACE2 (PDB ID - 6M17) shows the binding of individual monomer of spike (S) protein with peptidase domain (PD)
of each monomer of hACE2 dimer. Inset – binding of hACE2 with inhibitor (PDB ID – 1R4L). N-glycosylation and its
sialylation at sites N90 and N322 could a play critical role in the binding of hACE2 with RBD of S protein but the
glycosylation may not have direct influence on inhibitor binding or hACE2 activity
Figure 2: Glycosylation profile on hACE2 characterized by high-resolution LC-MS/MS. A. All the seven potential Nglycosylation sites were found occupied along with one O-glycosylation site bearing core-1 type O-glycans. Mostly
complex type glycans were observed in all N-glycosylation sites. Some N-glycosylation sites were partially glycosylated.
Monosaccharide symbols follow the SNFG (Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans) system (Varki, A., Cummings, R.D., et
al. 2015). B. 3D model showing the location of N- and O-glycans on hACE2 dimer (PDB ID – 6M18). The potential
binding location of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with hACE2 receptor is predicted based on co-crystallization data available on
SARS-CoV-1 with hACE2 and the N-glycans at N90 and N322 could influence the receptor binding.
Figure 3: Quantitative glycosylation profile of glycans on hACE2 characterized by high-resolution LC-MS/MS. A.
relative ratio of non-glycosylated peptide and glycoforms detected on seven N-glycosylation sites; B. Relative ratio of

with assigned O-glycan (GalNAc1Gal1NeuAc2) at Thr730.
Figure 5: Schematic amino acid sequence alignment of glycosylation sites of ACE2 receptor from human, bat, pig,
cat, mouse, rabbit, Malayan pangolin and chicken (UniProt identifiers human [Q9BYF1], bat [U5WHY8], pig [K7GLM4],
cat [Q56H28], mouse [Q8R0I0], rabbit [G1TEF4], pangolin [XP_017505746.1], chicken [F1NHR4]). The number of Nlinked glycosylation motifs, -NXS/T- (XP), accounts for 7 potential sites in the human ACE2, 7 potential N-linked
glycosylation sites in the bat ACE2, 8 potential N-glycan sites in the porcine ACE2, 9 potential sites in the cat ACE2, 6
potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the murine ACE2, 8 sites in rabbit ACE2, 7 sites in pangolin ACE2, and 10 sites
in chicken ACE2. Blue colored are susceptible species and orange are non-susceptible species.

ESI-MSn. A. Deconvoluted profile of permethylated N-glycans from hACE2 (Only major glycoforms are shown). Masses
are shown as deconvoluted, molecular masses. The N-glycan structure were confirmed by ESI-MSn; B. Percentage
breakdowns of N-glycan class: High mannose/Hybrid 5%; Biantennary 59%; Triantennary 25%; Tetraantennary 11%.
C. Percentage breakdowns of Sialyation: Nonsialylated 51%; 1 NeuAc 36%; 2 NeuAc 11%; 3< NeuAc 3%. D.
Percentage breakdown of Fucosylation: No Fucose 14%; 1 Fucose 84%; 2 Fucose 2%.
Figure 7: A. MS2 Fragmentation of an N-glycan observed at m/z 1133 (sodiated; z=2). MS2 Fragmentation reveals
that there is a mixture of glycoforms that contain either core-linked or antennally-linked fucose; B. MS5 Fragmentation
of a sialylated N-glycan observed at m/z 1298 (lithium adduct; z=2). MS5 Fragmentation breaks down the antennal
arm to the sialylated galactose. Cross-ring fragmentation determines whether the sialyation was 2,3 or 2,6 linked; C:
MS6 Fragmentation of a complex-type N-glycan observed at m/z 1052 (sodium adduct; z=2). MS6 Fragmentation
breaks down the structure to the trimannose core. Fragmentation reveals the number of substituents, consistent with
bisecting GlcNAc. D: MS2 Fragmentation of an O-glycan observed at m/z 1256 (sodiated; z=1).

Glycosylation of human ACE2
Figures

Figure 1: Co-crystallization structure of SARS-CoV-1 trimer with hACE2 (PDB ID – 6ACG) and SARS-CoV-2 RBD
with hACE2 (PDB ID - 6M17) shows the binding of individual monomer of spike (S) protein with peptidase domain (PD)
of each monomer of hACE2 dimer. Inset – binding of hACE2 with inhibitor (PDB ID – 1R4L). N-glycosylation and its
sialylation at sites N90 and N322 could a play critical role in the binding of hACE2 with RBD of S protein but the
glycosylation may not have direct influence on inhibitor binding or hACE2 activity

Glycosylation of human ACE2

Figure 2: Glycosylation profile on hACE2 characterized by high-resolution LC-MS/MS. A. All the seven potential Nglycosylation sites were found occupied along with one O-glycosylation site bearing core-1 type O-glycans. Mostly
complex type glycans were observed in all N-glycosylation sites. Some N-glycosylation sites were partially glycosylated.
Monosaccharide symbols follow the SNFG (Symbol Nomenclature for Glycans) system (Varki, A., Cummings, R.D., et
al. 2015). B. 3D model showing the location of N- and O-glycans on hACE2 dimer (PDB ID – 6M18). The potential
binding location of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with hACE2 receptor is predicted based on co-crystallization data available on
SARS-CoV-1 with hACE2 and the N-glycans at N90 and N322 could influence the receptor binding.

Glycosylation of human ACE2

Figure 5: Schematic amino acid sequence alignment of glycosylation sites of ACE2 receptor from human, bat, pig,
cat, mouse, rabbit, Malayan pangolin and chicken (UniProt identifiers human [Q9BYF1], bat [U5WHY8], pig [K7GLM4],
cat [Q56H28], mouse [Q8R0I0], rabbit [G1TEF4], pangolin [XP_017505746.1], chicken [F1NHR4]). The number of Nlinked glycosylation motifs, -NXS/T- (XP), accounts for 7 potential sites in the human ACE2, 7 potential N-linked
glycosylation sites in the bat ACE2, 8 potential N-glycan sites in the porcine ACE2, 9 potential sites in the cat ACE2, 6
potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the murine ACE2, 8 sites in rabbit ACE2, 7 sites in pangolin ACE2, and 10 sites
in chicken ACE2. Blue colored are susceptible species and orange are non-susceptible species.

Glycosylation of human ACE2

Figure 7: A. MS2 Fragmentation of an N-glycan observed at m/z 1133 (sodiated; z=2). MS2 Fragmentation reveals
that there is a mixture of glycoforms that contain either core-linked or antennally-linked fucose; B. MS5 Fragmentation
of a sialylated N-glycan observed at m/z 1298 (lithium adduct; z=2). MS 5 Fragmentation breaks down the antennal
arm to the sialylated galactose. Cross-ring fragmentation determines whether the sialyation was 2,3 or 2,6 linked; C:
MS6 Fragmentation of a complex-type N-glycan observed at m/z 1052 (sodium adduct; z=2). MS 6 Fragmentation
breaks down the structure to the trimannose core. Fragmentation reveals the number of substituents, consistent with
bisecting GlcNAc. D: MS2 Fragmentation of an O-glycan observed at m/z 1256 (sodiated; z=1).
