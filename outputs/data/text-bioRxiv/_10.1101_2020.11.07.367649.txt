Abstract
The current pandemic of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has badly affected
our life during the year 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is the primary causative agent of the newly emerged
pandemic. Natural flavonoids, Terpenoid and Thymoquinone are tested against different viral
and host-cell protein targets. These natural compounds have a good history in treating Hepatitis
C Virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Molecular docking combined with
cytotoxicity and plaque reduction assay is used to test the natural compounds against different
viral (Spike, RdRp, and Mpro) and host-cell (TMPRSS II, keap 1, and ACE2) targets. The results
demonstrate the binding possibility of the natural compounds (Thymol, Carvacrol, Hesperidine,
and Thymoquinone) to the viral main protease (Mpro). Some of these natural compounds were
approved to start clinical trail from Egypt Center for Research and Regenerative Medicine
ECRRM IRB (Certificate No.IRB00012517)
Keywords:
COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Natural products; antivirals; docking; plaque reduction assay.

Introduction
By the end of 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan city in
China was detected and spread all over the world 1. On 10th October 2020, the number of
confirmed cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) reached more than 37 M worldwide with
+1M total death, as reported in the World Health Organization (WHO). The associated
pneumonia with the novel viral infection, COVID-19, is divided into three phases that
correspond to different clinical stages of the disease 2. Stage 1 is the asymptomatic stage, where
the inhaled virus binds to nasal epithelial cells in the nasal cavity and starts replicating. Stage 2 is
the upper airway stage, where the virus propagates, migrates down the respiratory tract along the
conducting airways, and a more robust innate immune response is triggered. About 20% of the
infected patients will progress to stage 3 disease and develop pulmonary infiltrates. Some of
these patients will develop a very severe disease as the virus reaches alveoli in the lung and
infects alveolar type II cells in peripheral and sub-pleural areas of the lung 3. SARS-CoV-2
propagates within type II cells, large numbers of viral particles are released, and the cells
undergo apoptosis and die. Therefore, the spectrum of symptomatic COVID-19 ranges from mild
respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonia that may progress to fatal respiratory syndrome
and multi-organ malfunctions 2.
Thymol,

known

as 2-isopropyl-5-methylphenol,

is

a

natural mono-

terpenoid phenol derivative of Cymene. It is found in thyme oil and extracted from Thymus
vulgaris 4. Thymol is a white crystalline substance that has a pleasant aromatic odor. Thymol
also provides the distinctive and robust flavor of the culinary herb thyme.
Carvacrol is known as monoterpenoid phenol and extracted from Oregano. It has a
characteristic pungent and warm odor 5.

Hesperidine is a common flavone glycoside found in citrus fruit such as lemons and
sweet oranges

6,7

. It has several pharmacological activities such as antihyperlipidemic, anti-

atherogenic, venotonic, antidiabetic, cardioprotective, anti- antihypertensive, and inflammatory
actions

6,7

. The anti-inflammatory activity of hesperidin was mainly attributed to its antioxidant

defense mechanism and suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine production 6. Hesperidin
exhibited antiviral activity against the influenza virus through a significant reduction of viral
replication.
Nigella sativa (NS) contains many active molecules, such as thymoquinone (TQ), two
forms of alkaloids: isoquinoline alkaloid that includes nigellicimine, nigellicimine n-oxide
and pyrazol alkaloid that includes nigellidine and nigellicine

8,9

. TQ is the most abundant

constituent in the volatile oil of Nigella sativa seeds, and most of the herb’s properties are
attributed to it

10,11

. It has been reported that NS oil can decrease the viral count of HCV in

patients received capsules of NS oil (450 mg) three times a day over a 3-month period

12

.

Moreover, two clinical studies documented to sustained sero-reversion of the HIV virus over
treatment period of 6 to 12 months 13-15.
Molecular docking represents a promising in silico method used to predict the binding
affinities of small molecules to proteins as a first step in structure based drug design

16-21

. This

study investigated many active ingredients that showed antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2,
such as Thymol, Carvacrol, Hesperidine, and Thymoquinone. Molecular docking is used to test
the binding affinities of these natural product derived compounds against different viral and host
cell proteins. Additionally cytotoxicity assay and plaque reduction assay are used to verify their
antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 collected from Egyptian patients.

Materials and methods
In silico testing:
Before performing the docking studies, the tested compounds are retrieved from the PubChem
database and then prepared using PyMOL software

22,23

. The structures of the proteins are

downloaded from the protein data bank 24. Autodock Tools are used to prepare the docking input
files after adding charges

25

. The docking experiments are performed utilizing Autodock Vina

software in triplicates to have a clear depiction of the mode of action of compounds against their
protein targets

26

. SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S), The RNA dependent RNA polymerase

(RdRp), the main protease (Mpro) are used as protein targets due to its critical role in maintaining
the viral infection

27-31

. Additionally, the host-cell receptors, Transmembrane protease, serine 2

(TMPRSS II), Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP 1) and the Angiotensin Converting
Enzyme 2 (ACE2) are targeted due to its fundamental in viral recognition and maintain
infectivity for SARS-CoV-2

32-35

. For each compound, ten interactions were generated and one

with best binding affinity was selected. PyMOL software was used to represent and analyze the
docking complexes.
Experimental section:
All the chemical compounds are purchased from different sources as follow; Thymol
purchased from upnature as THYME 100% pure and natural 118 ml, Carvacrol purchased
from Zane Hellas as oil of Oregano 30 ml, Hesperidin purchased from science-based nutrition
as hesperidin methyl chalcone 500 mg -60 veggie caps, and Thymoquinone purchased from

A) Cytotoxicity assay
Samples were diluted with Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM). Stock
solutions of the test compounds were prepared in 10 % DMSO in ddH2O. The cytotoxic
activity of the extracts were tested in Vero E6 cells by using the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol -2yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method

36

with minor modification. Briefly, the

cells were seeded in 96 well-plates (100 µl/well at a density of 3×105 cells/ml) and incubated
for 24 hrs at 37oC in 5%CO2. After 24 hrs, cells were treated with various concentrations of
the tested compounds in triplicates. After further 24 hrs, the supernatant was discarded and
cell monolayers were washed with sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS) 3 times and MTT
solution (20 µl of 5 mg/ml stock solution) was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 4
hrs followed by medium aspiration. In each well, the formed formazan crystals were dissolved
with 200 µl of acidified isopropanol (0.04 M HCl in absolute isopropanol = 0.073 ml HCL in
50 ml isopropanol). Absorbance of formazan solutions were measured at λmax 540 nm with
620 nm as a reference wavelength using a multi-well plate reader. The percentage of
cytotoxicity compared to the untreated cells was determined with the following equation.

The plot of % cytotoxicity versus sample concentration was used to calculate the
concentration which exhibited 50% cytotoxicity (IC50).
B) Plaque reduction assay
Assay was carried out according to the method of 37 in a six well plate where Vero E6 cells
(105 cells

/

ml) were cultivated for 24 hrs at 37oC. Sever Acute Respiratory Syndrome

Coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) virus was diluted to give 103 PFU /well and mixed with the safe
concentration of the tested compounds and incubated for 1 hour at 37oC before being added to
the cells. Growth medium was removed from the cell culture plates and the cells were
inoculated with (100 µl /well) virus with the tested compounds, After 1 hour contact time for
virus adsorption, 3 ml of DMEM supplemented with 2% agarose and the tested compounds
was added onto the cell monolayer, plates were left to solidify and incubated at 37oC till
formation of viral plaques (3 to 4 days). Formalin (10%) was added for two hours then plates
were stained with 0.1

crystal violet in distilled water. Control wells were included where

%

untreated virus was incubated with Vero E6 cells and finally plaques were counted and
percentage reduction in plaques formation in comparison to control wells was recorded as
following:
% inhibition = [viral count (untreated) - viral count (treated)/viral count (untreated)] x 100.

-Statistical analysis:
Analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism 8.0.2. Data are represented as mean ± SD and
statistical significance was evaluated using one-way ANOVA followed by tukey multiple
comparison tests.

Results and discussion
Many reports showed that different natural product derived compounds have promising
results against inflammation and viral infections including the newly emerged viral infection
(SARS-CoV-2)

15,38-40

. Different natural compounds and their derivatives proved its binding

affinity against different SARS-CoV-2 and host-cell targets 38,39,41.
Figure 1 shows the 2D structures of the selected natural compounds used in the current
study against viral and host-cell protein targets.

Figure 1 The structures of the natural compounds used in the study retrieved from the PubChem database.

Three SARS-CoV-2 proteins are targeted in this study including the viral, host-cell
recognizing critical element, spike protein (Figure 2A), the vital viral enzyme RNA dependent
RNA polymerase (RdRp), responsible for the polymerization of the complement RNA copy,
and the Main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, which is critical for polyprotein processing
(Figure 2B)

42-47

. The spike protein trimers over the virions take different conformations

during infection such as the prefusion and postfusion. The prefusion has open and closed
conformations in which one or two of the receptor binding domains (RBD) are exposed
(open) or immersed into the trimer (close) 30,48.

Table 1 shows the binding affinity calculated using AutoDock Vina software for the
docking of the natural compounds (Thymol, Carvacrol, Hesperidine, and Thymoquinone) against
the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as a protein target. The standard compound Chloroquine is used to assess
the binding affinity of the natural compounds against the Mpro. As reflected from the values,
Carvacrol, Hesperidine, and Thymoquinone show comparable binding affinities (-7.0, -6.9, and 6.9 kcal/mol, respectively) to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro compared to that of the standard compound (7.2 kcal/mol). Thymol show slightly higher (worse) binding affinity value (-5.8 kcal/mol)
compared to Chloroquine but still able to bind the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro tightly. Figures 3A and 3B
show the 3D poses for the docking complexes. The four compounds (Thymol, Carvacrol,
Hesperidine, and Thymoquinone) are able to bind to the active site of the Mpro (His41 and
Cys145).

In vitro study for accessing the antiviral effect of natural products against SARS-CoV-2:
Our results revealed that Hesperidine was the most affective natural product against SARS-CoV-2 in Egyptians patients, as it caused inhibition to approximately 100% for infected Vero E6 cell
ell
line, Carvacrol, Thymoquinone caused inhibition to about 98%, Chloroquine as a positive
ve
control caused inhibition to 98% and Thymol show the lowest inhibition percentage 96% for
infected Vero E6 cell line.
The results showed significantly difference between natural products effect with (P-value <
0.0001) as shown in figure 5.
nd
These results indicate that Hesperidine and other natural compounds as Carvacrol and
Thymoquinone could be therapeutic agent against SARS-CoV-2 in Egypt as treatment resulted in
the effective loss of essentially all viral material by time.
Eventually, development of an effective anti-viral for SARS-CoV-2, if given to patients early in
infection, could help to limit the viral load, prevent severe disease progression and limit person-person transmission. Benchmarking testing of those natural compounds against other potential
ial
antivirals for SARS-CoV-2 with alternative mechanisms of action would thus be important as
soon as practicable.
