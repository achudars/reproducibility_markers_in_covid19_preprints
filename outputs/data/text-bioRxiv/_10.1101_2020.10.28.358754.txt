Abstract

23

Torovirus (ToV) has recently been classified in the new family Tobaniviridae, although it belonged to the

24

Coronavirus (CoV) family historically. Reverse genetics systems for many CoVs have been established, but

25

none exist for ToVs. Here, we describe a reverse genetics system using a full-length infectious cDNA clone of

26

bovine ToV (BToV) in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Recombinant BToV containing genetic markers

27

had the same phenotype as wild-type (wt) BToV. To generate two types of recombinant virus, the

28

Hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene was manipulated, since cell-adapted wtBToV generally loses the full-

29

length HE (HEf), resulting in soluble HE (HEs). First, recombinant viruses with HEf and HA-tagged HEf or

30

HEs genes were rescued; these showed no significant differences in cell growth, suggesting that HE is not

31

essential for viral growth in cells. Then, recombinant virus in which HE was replaced by the Enhanced Green

32

Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) gene expressed EGFP in infected cells, but showed significantly reduced viral

33

growth compared to wtBToV. Moreover, the recombinant virus readily deleted the EGFP gene after one

34

passage. Interestingly, one variant with mutations in non-structural proteins (NSPs) showed improved EGFP

35

expression and viral growth during serial passages, although it eventually deleted the EGFP gene, suggesting

36

that these mutations contributed to EGFP gene acceptance. These recombinant viruses provide new insights

37

regarding BToV and its reverse genetics will help advance understanding of this neglected pathogen.

Importance

39

ToVs are diarrhea-causing pathogens that have been detected in many species, including humans. BToV has

40

spread worldwide, leading to economic losses. We developed the first reverse genetics system for

41

Tobaniviridae using a BAC-based BToV. Using this system, we showed that recombinant BToVs with HEf

42

and HEs showed no significant differences in cell growth. In contrast, clinical BToVs generally lose the HE

43

gene after a few passages but some recombinant viruses retained the HE gene for up to 20 passages,

44

suggesting some benefits of HE retention. The EGFP gene of the recombinant viruses was unstable and was

45

rapidly deleted, likely via negative selection. Interestingly, one virus variant with mutations in NSPs was

46

more stable, resulting in improved EGFP-expression and viral growth, suggesting that the mutations

47

contributed to some acceptance of the exogenous EGFP gene without clear positive selection. The

48

recombinant BToVs and reverse genetics developed here are powerful tools for understanding fundamental

49

viral processes and their pathogenesis and for developing BToV vaccines.

Introduction

51

Torovirus (ToV) belongs to order Nidovirales, family Tobaniviridae, subfamily Torovirinae and genus

52

Torovirus (1). ToVs are a causative agent of diarrheic and respiratory diseases, and are detected in many

53

species including bovine, equine, swine, goat, and human species (2–7). Although ToV infections are generally

54

asymptomatic or do not have severe symptoms, the bovine torovirus (BToV) (8–16) and porcine ToV (PToV)

55

(17–22) are distributed globally, causing economic loss. At present, there are no drugs and vaccines available

56

for treatment and prevention of this disease.

57

ToVs are enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with a genome 25-30kb in length, comprising

58

the conserved six open reading frames. The first two-thirds of the genome contains ORF1a and ORF1b, with

59

an overlap by a frameshift, encoding the replicase/transcriptase proteins (22–25). The remaining one-third

60

of the genome encodes four structural proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), and

61

nucleocapsid (N) (26–30). ToV genome seemed to have occasionally undergone inter-genotype recombination

62

events (31–33).

63

ToVs were difficult to propagate in cultured cells, with the exception of equine ToV (6); however, in the last

64

13 years, a new cell line, human rectal tumor-18 (HRT18) cells, has been shown to be susceptible to BToV,

65

and several BToVs in Japan were successfully isolated and propagated using HRT18 cells (33–37). BToV with

66

the full length HE gene was initially isolated from diarrheal feces, whereas cell-adapted BToV, after several

67

passages in HRT18 cells, generally lost a full-length HE protein as a result of HE gene mutation (34, 35).

68

This finding suggests that the HE protein is not essential for replication in cell culture and may instead

69

suppress it.

70

ToVs historically belonged to the family Coronaviridae, which was divided into the subfamilies coronavirus

71

(CoV) and ToVs, since both viruses are structurally and morphologically similar despite having some

72

differences (24, 38–40). CoVs are mainly associated with respiratory and enteric diseases and are regarded

73

as important pathogens in humans and animals. In human CoVs, in addition to four human CoVs causing

74

mild upper respiratory disease (41), three novel life-threating CoVs that cause acute lung injury have

75

emerged in the 21st century, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002-

76

2003 (42, 43), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 (44), and SARS-CoV-2 in

77

2019 (45, 46). In animals, some CoVs cause severe or lethal diseases in swine (porcine epidemic diarrhea

78

virus [PEDV] and transmissible gastroenteritis virus [TGEV]), bovine (bovine CoV), avian (infectious

79

bronchitis virus [IBV]), mouse (mouse hepatitis virus [MHV]), and feline (Feline infectious peritonitis virus

80

[FIPV]) animals. As such, numerous studies have been conducted on CoVs. Notably, reverse genetics systems

81

for many human and animal CoVs, including the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2, have been established to

82

study these fundamental viral processes and pathogenesis or to aid in vaccine development (47–68). Full-

83

length cDNA-based reverse genetics systems of CoVs have been made, although there were obstacles such as

84

large genome sizes, thereby complicating genome engineering, and the instability of some CoV replicase

85

genes in bacteria. Currently, four systems are available: bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) (48), in vitro

86

ligation of cDNA fragments (47), vaccinia vector with full-length CoV cDNA (59), and the recently developed

87

yeast artificial chromosome systems (60). Thanks to these systems, a greater understanding of CoVs has been

88

gained.

89

In contrast to CoVs, only few studies of ToVs have been conducted, and no reverse genetics systems have

90

been established since many ToVs are difficult to propagate in cells, and because less attention has been paid

91

to ToVs as ToV infections are generally asymptomatic or not severe. In this study, we describe a reverse

92

genetic system for BToV (Aichi strain) based on the cloning of a full-length genomic cDNA into BAC. Using

93

this system, recombinant viruses with HA-tagged HE gene, untagged full-length HE gene, or with EGFP

94

gene, were successfully rescued by manipulating the HE gene; these viruses were then characterized.

Results

98

Full-length genome sequence of wild-type (wt) BToV.

99

To determine the parent BToV (Aichi strain) for reverse genetics, the full-length genomic sequences of three

100

plaque-purified BToV were analyzed. We tried to determine the 5’ terminal end of these viruses using the 5’

101

RACE method, but several different sequences were observed in the terminal three bases; 5’-TGACGT-3’, 5’-

102

GTACGT-3’, 5’-GGACGT-3’, 5’-GACGT-3’, 5’-ACGT-3’, 5’-(-)CGT-3’. The sequence at the 5’ terminal end of

103

three published BToVs (25, 33) and two published PToVs (Accession # JQ860350 and KM403390) all shared

104

the 5’-TGACGT-3’ sequence, whereas equine ToV showed 5’-ACGT-3’ (74). Whether the differences observed

105

in the BToVs were due to the intrinsic features of BToV or due to suboptimal experimental condition of the

106

5' RACE method remained unclear. However, 5’-TGACGT-3, previously reported in published BToVs and

107

PToVs, was found in only one out of seven in our analysis, whereas 5’-ACGT-3’ reported in equine BToV is a

108

consensus sequence. Thus, in this study, the sequence at 5’ terminal end of BToV was set as 5’-ACGT-3’. Two

109

BToV clones showed the same sequence; from these, one was selected as the parent virus (wtBToV).

110
111

Construction of a full-length BToV genome in BAC.

112

Full-length BToV (Aichi strain) genome cDNA was assembled into the pBeloBAC11 plasmid carrying

113

cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early promoter, hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (Rz), and bovine growth

114

hormone (BGH) termination, and the cDNA was inserted downstream off the CMV promoter and flanked by

115

a 25-poly(A) sequence. The BToV genome cDNA was amplified into eight PCR fragments

116

carrying homology arms (hms) at both terminals, and these were sequentially assembled (Fig. 1A) using the

117

Red/ET recombination method described in the Materials and Methods (Fig. 1B). After assembly of the eight

118

fragments, the BAC carrying the full-length BToV genome cDNA (pBAC-BToVmut1) contained two single

119

mutations at nucleotide (nt) G3399Tand at nt T8469G, and the 1,350 bp E. coli chromosomal derived

120

sequence was inserted at nt 10,136, likely to counter the toxic regions in bacteria observed in some CoVs (47,

121

62, 63) (Fig. 2A). These two single mutations and E. coli sequence were reverted as described in the Materials

122

and Methods (Fig. 2A).

126

plasmid, two gene makers were inserted into the HE gene at nt T26530C and T26554A (both silent) (pBAC-

127

BToV) (Fig. 2B). pBAC-BToV was first transfected into nonpermissive 293T, COS7, BHK, Vero, and Huh7

128

cells because of the very low transfection efficiency of permissive HRT18 cells. Of these cells, 293T showed

129

the best virus production with no clear cytopathic effect (CPE), and the viral titer of the supernatant 3 days

130

post-transfection (dpt) averaged 1.0 × 104.1 TCID50/ ml (N=3), suggesting that the host range specificity of

131

BToV, which was difficult to propagate in cultured cells, was primarily determined by the entry step, which

132

was also observed in CoVs (47, 59, 63). The supernatant from transfected 293T was inoculated into permissive

133

HRT18 cells, after which the virus was plaque-purified three times, and then the purified virus was used to

134

characterize phonotypic properties. CPE and plaque morphology induced or formed by rBToV were identical

135

to parental wtBToV (Fig. 3B and 4A). Comparison of the full-length genome sequence between rBToV and

136

wtBToV showed complete sequence identities except for two gene markers (Fig. 3C). To compare growth

137

kinetics between rBToV and wtBToV, HRT18 cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001,

138

and supernatants were harvested at the indicated times. rBToV and wtBToV had indistinguishable growth

139

properties in HRT18 cells and had peaked titers of >1.0 × 106.4 TCID50/ml at 48 h post infection (pi) (Fig. 4D).

140

Thus, a full-length infectious cDNA clone of BToV in the BAC system was successfully constructed, and

141

features of the rescued rBToV and parental wtBToV had the same phenotypic properties in HRT18 cells.

142
143

Characterization of recombinant BToV with full-length HE or HA-tagged HE gene

144

Although BToV initially isolated from clinical samples had full-length HE (HEf) genes, cell adapted BToV

145

usually lost HEf due to a stop codon somewhere in HE gene. Cell-adapted wtBToV in our laboratory also has

146

a stop codon at nt 481 (the base number of HE gene), CAG (Q)→TAG (stop), resulting in soluble HE 160 aa

147

in length (HEs) (Fig. 3A). This suggested that HE protein is dispensable for virus replication in cells and may

148

have a negative effect on it (34–37). However, the precise functions of BToV HE protein in cellular viral

149

growth still remains elusive. To investigate HE gene stability and the effect of HE protein on viral growth in

150

HRT18 cells, recombinant BToVs with HEf, or with HA-tagged HEf and HEs genes to facilitate their detection

151

were generated (designated as rHEf, rHEf/HA, rHEs/HA, and rBToV was written as rHEs together here,

152

respectively) (Fig. 3A). All these recombinant BToVs were successfully rescued using the same method

153

described in rBToV. They displayed no significant differences in plaque morphology and CPEs (data not

154

shown) in HRT18 cells compared to parental wtBToV and rBToV (rHEs) (Fig. 4A). To detect HEf or HA-tagged

155

HEf and HEs proteins, HRT18 cells infected with recombinant BToVs were fixed at 24 hpi. The cells were

156

then subjected to an α-NA esterase assay or to indirect immunofluorescence (IF) using mouse anti-M and

157

anti-HE antiserum or using rabbit anti-HA and mouse anti-HA 12CA5 antibodies. Stained cells were

158

observed under confocal laser scanning microscopy (Fig. 4B). M proteins were detected similarly in all

159

cells infected with the recombinant BToVs, and HE proteins and α-NA esterase activity were observed

160

only in cells infected with rHEf and rHEf/HA. On the other hand, HEs/HA proteins were well stained

161

by both anti-HA antibodies (only rabbit anti-HA antibody was shown), whereas HEf/HA protein was

162

barely stained despite being well detected by mouse anti-HE antiserum (Fig. 4B). We next tried to detect

163

HEf/HA by immunoblotting. Infected cells were lysed, and detection was performed using rabbit anti-N

164

antiserum and two anti-HA antibodies. With similar detection of N proteins in all infected cells, HEs/HA

165

could be detected in both anti-HA antibodies similar to IF results, whereas HEf/HA could not be detected by

166

rabbit anti-HA but could only be detected by the mouse anti-HA 12CA5 antibody (Fig. 4C). To investigate

167

whether the different reactivity of the C-terminal HA-tag was due to the modification of the HA-tag in the

168

cytoplasm by either an infected cell metabolic change or viral proteins, HA-tagged proteins in COS7 cells

169

transiently expressing HEf/HA and HEs/HA were attempted to be detected in the same way. Both HA-tagged

170

proteins could be stained in IF (data not shown), but reactivity did not change in immunoblotting (Fig. 4C).

171

Although we could not rule out the possibility that differences were due to the modification or due to the

172

expression level of HA-tag of HEf/HA in infected cells from IF results, immunoblotting results at least

173

suggested that the C-terminal HA-tag of HEf/HA had the specific structure that affects reactivity of the anti-

174

HA antibodies. Finally, to compare growth kinetics, HRT18 cells were infected with these recombinant BToVs

175

with a MOI of 0.001. All these recombinant BToVs, wtBToV, and rBToV (rHEs) had no significant differences

176

in growth properties (Fig. 4D). These results indicated that recombinant BToVs could express full-length HE

177

and HA-tagged proteins in infected cells with growth ability comparable to those of the parental wtBToV and

178

to rBToV (rHEs)

179
180

Full-length HE gene stability of rHEf and rHEf/HA

181

To assess stability of the full-length HE gene of rHEf and rHEf/HA, HRT18 cells were infected with two

182

clones (No.1 and No.2) derived from different plaques of each virus, and viruses were serially passaged until

183

twenty passages (P20). Cells were infected with the viruses harvested at the indicated passage history and

184

were fixed or lysed at 24 hpi, and then subjected to either α-NA esterase assay or N protein-detection by

185

immunoblotting (Fig. 5A and 5B). N proteins were detected in all infected cells (Fig. 5B). On the other hand,

186

cells infected with rHEf No.2 and two rHEf/HA retained α-NA esterase activity until P19, whereas cells

187

infected with rHEf No.1 gradually decreased in activity during passages and completely lost activity at P19

188

(Fig. 5A). RT-PCR of the supernatants from infected cells (resulting in +1 passage history) using primers

189

flanking the HE gene showed that during serial passages, band sizes of rHEf No.1 without esterase activity

190

and rHEf No.2 with esterase activity were not different (Fig. 5C). On the other hand, although both rHEf/HA

191

exhibited esterase activity, a smaller band was observed in rHEf/HA No.2 from P10. To further study their

192

HE genes, all these viruses at P19 were plaque-purified once, and the HE gene of viruses from six well-

193

isolated plaques were sequenced. As summarized in Fig. 5D, all six rHEf No.1 sequences had one base

194

deletion at nt T19 in the HE gene, causing 17 aa short peptide with a stop codon by -1 frame shifting, and

195

three out of six had an additional deletion between nt 1,216 to nt 1,241. In contrast, all six rHEf No.2 retained

196

the full-length HE gene, and one out of six had an amino acid substitution at T321I in the HE protein. Out

197

of the six, five rHEf/HA No.1 retained the HA-tagged full-length HE gene, but one had an aa mutation within

198

the HA-tag (YPYDYPDYA→YLYDYPDYA), whereas three rHEf/HA No.2 retained the HA-tagged full-length

199

HE gene with a D247E substitution in the HE protein in one virus but the other three had a deletion between

200

nt 278 to nt 878, causing a short soluble HE protein 99 aa in length. These data partly supported the idea

201

that HE proteins are not essential or could have a negative effect on virus growth in HRT18 cells. However,

202

it is notable that each one clone could retain the full-length HE gene up to at least twenty passages. Thus,

203

cell adapted BToV may be able to retain full-length HE gene more stably in cells under certain conditions.

204
205

Characterization of recombinant BToV carrying EGFP gene

206

Since recombinant viruses carrying the reporter gene are helpful in understanding fundamental viral

207

processes and for screening therapeutic compounds, we attempted to generate recombinant BToV by

208

replacing the HE gene with the EGFP gene (rEGFP). Rescued rEGFP were plaque-purified three times and

209

expanded (clone No.1 and No.2) or expanded without plaque purification (No.3 to No.6) because of the

210

instability of the EGFP gene described below. rEGFP formed smaller and more heterogeneous plaques

211

compared to the parent wtBToV (Fig. 6A). To detect EGFP in infected cells, infected cells at 36 hpi were

212

observed under fluorescence microscope, or fixed, permeabilized, stained with mouse anti-M antiserum, and

213

observed under confocal laser scanning microscopy (Fig. 6B). EGFP-expressions were observed only in cells

214

infected with rEGFP but not with wtBToV and rBToV, and cells expressing EGFP always also expressed M

215

protein (Fig. 6B). These infected cells were next subjected to N protein and EGFP detection by

216

immunoblotting. Although the amount of N protein in the rEGFP-infected cells was significantly less than

217

that of cells infected with wtBToV and rBToV, EGFP was only detected in rEGFP-infected cells (Fig. 6C).

218

Comparison of growth kinetics among rEGFP, wtBToV, and rBToV showed that rEGFP significantly

219

decreased growth ability. In four independent experiments, no virus could be detected at 24 hpi, and peak

220

titer 1.0 × 103.8-4.6 TCID50/ml was observed at 48 to 72 hpi in three experiments, which decreased by >2 log

221

compared to parent viruses (Fig. 6D). In one experiment, peak titer reached 1.0 × 106.6 TCID50/ml at 72 hpi,

222

but the virus no longer expressed EGFP (Fig. 6D). These data indicated that rEGFP could express EGFP in

223

infected cells but significantly decreased its growth properties. Moreover, rEGFP seemed to readily lose

224

EGFP-expression during virus growth.

225

To study EGFP gene stability, HRT18 cells were infected with rEGFP, and viruses were serially passaged

226

until five passages (P5). Cells were infected with rEGFP harvested at the indicated passage history and were

227

observed under a fluorescence microscope (Fig. 7A). As a result, EGFP was not observed in most of the cells

228

infected with rEGFP (No.1 to No.4) after one passage. RT-PCR of P0 and P1 viruses using primers flanking

229

EGFP gene found that the all P0 rEGFP predominantly had the full-length EGFP gene, but smaller bands

230

were observed in all P1 rEGFP (No.1 to No.4) (Fig. 7B). Of these, the major bands of P1 rEGFP (No.2 to No.4)

231

were analyzed, and it was found that a large part of the EGFP gene was deleted (Fig. 7D), suggesting that

232

rEGFP readily lost EGFP-expression due to deletion of EGFP gene after one passage.

Improvement of EGFP-expression and growth properties in rEGFP variant

235

Interestingly, rEGFP No.5 and No.6 maintained the EGFP gene after one passage. No.6 gradually decreased

236

EGFP-expression until P5, while No.5 appeared to gradually increase (Fig. 7A). Thus, serial passages of

237

rEGFP No.5 was continued until P15, and the viruses were then harvested. Cells were infected with rEGFP

238

No.5 harvested at the indicated passage history and their supernatants (+1 passage history) were collected

239

and subjected to RT-PCR targeting EGFP gene (Fig. 7B), or the infected cells were lysed at 36 hpi and

240

subjected to N protein and EGFP detection by immunoblotting (Fig.7C). Although smaller bands were

241

observed, rEGFP No.5 retained full-length EGFP gene at least until P6 and mainly lost it by P9 (Fig. 7B),

242

but EGFP-expression was still observed in infected cells even at P9 to an extent (data not shown). The major

243

bands of P15 rEGFP No.5 (and P6 No.6: data not shown) were analyzed by sequencing, and a part of the

244

EGFP gene was deleted (Fig. 7D). Similar to RT-PCR results, immunoblotting of N protein and EGFP of

245

rEGFP showed that EGFP-expression level of No.5 was maximized at P5, and this gradually decreased until

246

P11 (Fig. 7C). It should be noted that the EGFP-expression level or growth property seemed to dramatically

247

increase compared to that of P0 rEGFP No.5.

248

To further investigate P5 rEGFP No.5, this was plaque-purified three times and three clones were expanded

249

(designated rEGFP c1-c3). These variants formed similar plaque morphologies to wtBToV and rBToV (Fig.

250

8A). Comparing growth kinetics among rEGFP c1-c3, wtBToV, and rBToV showed that their peak titer

251

reached 1.0 × 106.5-7.2 TCID50/ ml at 72 hpi, which is comparable to that of the parental viruses, although the

252

peak was reached one day slower (Fig. 8B). Cells infected with rEGFP c1-c3 were lysed at 24 hpi, and these

253

lysates were then subjected to N protein and EGFP detection. The result indicated that EGFP-expression

254

levels in these rEGFP c1-c3 were dramatically improved compared to P0 original virus (Fig.8C). Analysis of

255

the full-length genome sequence of rEGFP c1 revealed five aa substitutions at G1001S, C1442F, T2129I in

256

NSP1, I3562T in NSP4, and I5327V in NSP10 (Helicase), respectively, strongly suggesting that these

257

accumulated mutations in NSPs were involved in this phenotype (Fig.8D). Finally, EGFP gene stability in

258

rEGFP c1-c3 were investigated. As shown in Fig. 8E, these variants tend to stably express EGFP until P4,

259

but smaller bands due to the deletion of the full-length HE gene were mainly observed, with EGFP-expression

260

decreasing until P6 (data not shown in rEGFP c3). Sequencing the major band of P7 rEGFP c1-c3 showed

261

deletion of the EGFP gene, similar to those observed in other rEGFP (Fig.7D). These data indicated that any

262

or all of the five mutations in NSPs would contribute to some acceptance of exogenous gene such as EGFP

263

gene, resulting in improved EGFP-expression and viral growth in cells, although the EGFP gene was

264

eventually lost

Discussion

267

In this study, we successfully constructed a full-length infectious BToV cDNA clone in a bacterial artificial

268

chromosome. To our knowledge, this is the first reverse genetics system for the new family Tobaniviridae.

269
270

BAC construction

271

Red/ET recombination method used to assemble eight BToV cDNA fragments into the BAC has been recently

272

utilized for full-length cDNA assembly of some CoVs, PEDV, and FIPV (58, 75) and for introducing mutations

273

(76–78). This method is more rapid and produces mutated clones more efficiently than traditional methods

274

(78); however, despite several tries, the unintentional insertion of an E. coli-derived sequence which may

275

counter toxic regions could not be removed. Red/ET seemed not to function in restoring the toxic region to

276

the host. Thus, a type IIS restriction enzyme, SapI, was inserted into both ends of the E. coli-derived sequence,

277

and this was removed by in vitro self-ligation. The resulting plasmid could be successfully propagated in E.

278

coli without pRed/ET enzyme. Similar observations were not seen in the full-length genome assembly of

279

PEDV and FIPV into low copy BAC plasmid (58, 75), but were seen in the subcloning of the TGEV cDNA

280

fragment into high copy plasmids (47). The position wherein the E. coli sequence is inserted is similar in both

281

(BToV at nt 10,136 and TGEV at nt 9,973), suggesting that these regions (BToV is in 3C-like protease) were

282

particularly toxic in bacteria in ToVs and CoVs. Though it remains unclear whether very small amounts of

283

3C-like protease in E. coli or, functional viral proteins cleaved by this protease causes toxicity, the E. coli-

284

derived sequence was inserted not when the BToV-C fragment containing the 3C-like protease gene was

285

assembled but when the full-length 1ab gene (BToV-F fragment) was assembled. For BToV, since insertion of

286

the E. coli-derived sequence was observed even in low copy BAC plasmid, this region may be more toxic than

287

that of CoV or Red/ET recombination method may be prone to this. Thus, to establish other BAC-based ToV

288

reverse genetics using this method, it may be better to counter the toxic region (3-C like protease gene)

289

beforehand with an E. coli-derived sequence flanked by type IIS restriction enzymes for subsequent in vitro

290

ligation.

292

Characterization of recombinant BToV with manipulating HE gene.

293

Since cell-adapted BToV generally lost the full-length HE gene, HE protein is not essential for viral growth

294

in cells or could suppress growth (34–37, 69). To study this, we generated rHEf with full-length HE gene and

295

rHEf/HA, rHEs/HA with HA-tagged HEf, or HEs gene. Comparing their growth kinetics to wtBToV and

296

rBToV (rHEs) showed no significant differences; however, during serial passaging of two clones from each

297

rHEf and rHEf/HA , each clone lost the full-length HE gene, supporting the above idea. In contrast, each the

298

other clone could retain the full-length-HE gene at least until twenty passages. This was unexpected because

299

another BToV (Niigata strain) isolated from a clinical sample in our laboratory easily lost the full-length HE

300

gene somewhere due to a stop codon insertion until eight passages during cell-adaptation (Islam and Taguchi,

301

unpublished data). Thus, the negative effect on HE protein in the cells of cell-adapted Aichi-BToV may be

302

lower than that of non-cell-adapted Niigata-BToV. Furthermore, HE proteins of cell-adapted Aichi-BToV may

303

have some advantage in terms of viral growth in the cells.

304

HE proteins are retained not only in ToV, but also in some of the beta CoVs (79). HE is a type I glycoprotein

305

on the viral envelope with two reversible functional domains: one binds O-acetylated sialic acids (O-Ac-Sia)

306

and the other destroys this binding. Both viruses also contain another type I glycoprotein S protein

307

responsible for receptor-binding and fusion activity. Among some beta CoVs, the species Betacoronavirus-1,

308

including human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), bovine coronavirus, and porcine hemagglutinating

309

encephalomyelitis virus, use O-Ac-Sia as the receptor via the S protein (80, 81). Thus, these viruses bind to

310

O-Ac-Sia via both the S and HE proteins, while HE acts as a receptor-destroying enzyme that promotes

311

release of progeny viruses from infected cells and helps avoid attachment to non-permissive cells or to

312

receptor-like decoy. The importance of HE in these viruses has been reported, and HE of HCoV-OC43 plays

313

an essential role in the efficient release of progeny viruses from infected cells (82) and balancing receptor-

314

binding and receptor-destroying of HE contributes to host adaptation (83). In contrast, the species Murine

315

coronavirus, a mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in which the S protein uses CAECAM1a as receptor (84) and in

316

which HE binds to O-Ac-Sia exclusively (85) does not require HE proteins for viral growth. In fact, many cell-

317

adapted laboratory strains of MHV fail to produce HE (86), with MHV rapidly losing it during serial passages

318

(87, 88), which is similar to BToV. On the other hand, experiments using recombinant MHV carrying the full-

319

length HE gene showed about half of the HE deficiencies until six passages (88), while our experiment showed

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.28.358754; this version posted October 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this

320

that some recombinant BToVs could retain HE at least until twenty passages. This may be explained by the

321

hemagglutination activity of the S protein of cell-adapted Aichi-BToV (37). It is not known whether the

322

hemagglutination activity is mediated via O-Ac-Sia binding, but, if so, HE protein may contribute to the

323

regulation of S protein-mediated cell surface attachment to facilitate release of progeny viruses. Alternatively,

324

in twenty passages, accumulation of mutations in other regions may contribute to HE protein acceptance, as

325

observed in rEGFP. Although the precise function of BToV HE remains to be elucidated, further studies using

326

these recombinant BToVs will bring better understanding.

327
328

Characterization of recombinant BToV with EGFP gene.

329

Since recombinant viruses expressing reporter proteins such as GFP, Red Fluorescent Protein and luciferase

330

are useful for understanding fundamental viral processes and for high-throughput testing of therapeutic

331

compounds, some recombinant CoVs carrying these reporters were generated (50, 54, 55, 57, 58). These

332

recombinant CoVs have their ORF3, ORF4 or ORF5 accessory genes replaced with reporter genes, and these

333

could all stably express reporter proteins, with their growth abilities comparable to or slightly reduced

334

compared to the parent virus. In contrast, rFGFP in which the HE gene, which is also an accessory gene, was

335

substituted with EGFP gene, could express a fluorescent protein, but it showed significantly reduced growth

336

compared to parental wtBToV, as well as less EGFP-expression. Furthermore, rEGFP easily lost EGFP-

337

expression ability after only one passage due to the deletion of HE genes. Since EGFP itself is a neutral

338

protein, which probably does not give any advantage or disadvantage to viral growth in cells, whereas rEGFP

339

with deleted EGFP gene increased in terms of growth properties (Fig.6D), EGFP gene itself rather than

340

EGFP would lead to a significant decrease in viral growth. It is interesting to note that, despite eight

341

independent experiments, starting points of HE deletion in the five were concentrated at around specific

342

positions, namely nt 24, 27, 28, and 30, and likewise the end points of the four were concentrated at around

343

nt 668, 671, 673, and 690 (Fig.7D), suggesting that “specific negative positions” of the EGFP gene are easily

344

recognized and deleted. Deletion patterns of the EGFP gene showed that in many cases, a large part of or the

345

entire EGFP, even including a part of the transcription-regulating sequence of EGFP (HE) and, the

346

untranslated region between EGFP (HE) and the N genes, were deleted, whereas a relatively short deletion

347

leading to retention of more than 80% of the EGFP gene was also observed (Fig. 7D). All rEGFP with deleted

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.28.358754; this version posted October 28, 2020. The copyright holder for this

348

genes rapidly replaced intact rEGFP, likely under negative selection of EGFP genetic structure. These

349

suggested that either the entirety or a part of the EGFP gene structure may suppress viral genome replication

350

or transcription, resulting in decreased viral growth.

351

On the other hand, rEGFP variant obtained during serial passages showed remarkably improved EGFP-

352

expression and growth ability in the cells. This is noteworthy considering EGFP gene has a negative effect

353

on viral growth whereas a neutral EGFP protein exists without clear positive selection. rEGFP variant

354

contained accumulated five mutations in NSPs: three in NSP1, and one each in NSP4 and NSP10 (helicase),

355

respectively. Though functions of NSP1 and NSP4 of ToVs remain unknown, the primary function of helicase,

356

which is highly conserved among nidoviruses including ToVs and CoVs, is to unwind DNA or RNA duplexes

357

(89). The crystal structure of MERS-CoV helicase (corresponding to NSP13) showed that it comprises

358

multiple domains, an N-terminal Cys/His rich domain (CH) binding to three zinc atoms, a beta-barrel domain,

359

and a C-terminal helicase core with two Rec-A like domains (90). Protein sequence alignment between MERS

360

and BToV helicase by MEGA6 software (91) revealed that the mutation at I5327V (I68V in helicase) was

361

located next to Cys69 (corresponding to Cys72 of MERS-CoV helicase) in the CH, one of the cysteine residues

362

that coordinated with the third zinc atom. It was reported that alanine substitutions in highly conserved

363

Cys/His in CH of HCoV-229E and other nidovirus equine viral arteritis have big effects on helicase activity

364

(92, 93). Thus, one possibility is that mutation in the CH of rEGFP helicase may facilitate to unwind “specific

365

negative positions” of the EGFP gene, resulting in increased growth. However, even this variant showed

366

similar EGFP gene deletion patterns to other intact rFGFP until five passages. This finding that the virus

367

tolerates unfavorable foreign gene to some degree without clear positive selection may contribute in

368

understanding the mechanism by which the virus evolves by accepting other genes.

369
370

In this article, we descraibe a reverse genetics platform for BAC-based BToV, which is a useful tool for

371

understanding fundamental viral processes and pathogenesis and for BToV vaccine development. Moreover,

372

since the rEGFP variant carrying the middle stable EGFP gene can be plaque-purified and expanded for

373

practical use, this recombinant virus can be used for high-throughput testing of therapeutic compounds and

374

entry assays. Recently, in addition to a unique combination of discontinuous and continuous ToV RNA

375

synthesis(94) , differences between CoVs and ToVs such as “hidden” proteins (U1 and U2) of unknown

function suspected to be translated from non-AUG initiation codons (CUG-initiation) (95) and N protein

proteins and unique RNA synthesis mechanisms.

at 37°C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s Modified Minimum Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA)

384

supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) [DMEM(+)] and penicillin (50 units/mL)-streptomycin (50

(rabbit anti-N) antiserum were obtained by in vivo electroporation of mice with pCAGGS-BToV-HEf according

391

to the method previously described (70), by immunizing mice with the M protein synthetic peptide (2-

392

FETNYWPFPDQAPN-15), and by immunizing rabbit with the N protein synthetic peptide (141-

agarose (Nacalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan), 2nM L-glutamine (Sanko Junyaku Co., Tokyo, Japan), 10mM HEPES

409

(Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) and PS, and these were incubated at 37°C until the appropriate sized plaque

410

were observed (approx. three days). Cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde (Fujifilm Wako) and stained

411

with crystal violet. For plaque purification of virus, without cell fixation, a well-isolated plaque was picked

412

and resuspended in 100 μL DMEM(-) and stored at -70°C. Then, a 50 μL aliquot from the 100 μL plaque

413

solution was expanded in HRT18 cells with DMEM(-) in a 10 cm dish, and then these viruses were harvested

414

after the appropriate CPE was observed and was stored at -70°C as a master stock. 200 μL of master virus

415

was expanded in the cells in an 18 cm dish and was used as a working wtBToV.

417

RNA extraction, RT-PCR and sequencing

418

Viral RNA was extracted from 100–250 μL of the supernatant using TRIzol® LS Reagent (Thermo Fisher

419

Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Complementary DNA was synthesized using a

420

SuperScript III® first-strand synthesis system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Oligo dT15 primer (TaKaRa,

421

Shiga, Japan) or Oligo dT-3 sites Adaptor Primer for 3’ RACE (Takara). To analyze the complete BToV genome,

422

seven fragments of about 3500–4500 base pair (bp) overlapping 170–360 bp (which correspond to BToV-

423

derived sequence of fragments BToV-A to -G described below) and one fragment of about 320 bp of the 3’-

424

terminal region by 3’ RACE were amplified using Phusion High-Fidelity PCR Kit (New England Biolabs, MA,

425

USA) under the following conditions [98°C, 50 s; 35 cycles of (98°C, 10 s; 60–65°C, 30 s; 72°C, 1 min/kb); 72°C

426

10 min], and these PCR fragments were purified with AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). 5’ ends of

427

the viral genome were analyzed by 5'-Full RACE Core Set (TaKaRa) and the PCR products of 5’ RACE were

428

cloned using pGEM®-T Easy Vector Systems (Promega, WI, USA). Purified PCR fragments and pGEM

429

cloning 5’-terminal sequence of BToV were sequenced using primers designed for every ~300 bp of the BToV

430

genome. Sequences were assembled by MEGA6 (71) or Sequencher software (Hitachi High-Tech, Tokyo,

431

Japan). Even without 5’ RACE, almost the entire full-length sequencing was achieved, except for 21 bp at the

432

5’ terminal end derived from the primer, which was applied to the full-length sequencing of rBToV and rEGFP

436

pBeloBAC11 containing CMV immediate-early promoter, Rz, and BGH termination (48) was used. Full-

437

length cDNA of the BToV genome was assembled under the control of the CMV promoter and was flanked at

438

the 3’-terminal end by a poly(A) tail (Fig. 1A), using a Red/ET recombination system counterselection BAC

439

modification kit (Gene Bridges Heidelberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Fig. 1B).

440

Briefly, E. coli strain NEB10ß (Bio-Rad) carrying the BAC was electroporated with the pRed/ET expression

441

plasmid using an Eppendorf Eporator® (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The Red/ET recombinant enzyme

442

was induced by L-arabinose (Sigma-Aldrich) and a temperature shift from 30°C to 37°C, and then linear

443

rpsL/Neo counter-selection/selection cassette (prepared by PCR) flanked by hms was electroporated so that

444

the Red/ET recombination inserts the rpsL/Neo cassette into the target position through hms. Only E. coli

445

carrying the BAC with the rpsL/Neo cassette could be selected by kanamycin at 30°C. The Red/ET enzyme

446

was induced in the same way in E. coli carrying modified BAC and was electroporated with the linear cDNA

447

fragment of BToV flanked by hms. Red/ET recombination could replace the rpsL/Neo cassette with the cDNA

448

fragment of BToV. Only E. coli carrying the BAC with the target BToV cDNA fragment could be selected by

449

streptomycin at 37°C at which the pRed/ET plasmid was removed (Fig. 1B). To use this system, the full-

450

length genomic sequence of BToV was divided into eight fragments flanked by the hms and was assembled

451

into the BAC plasmid in a sequential order (Fig. 1A). To distinguish the base numbers between BToV and

452

BAC, BToV genome is 28,313 nt (without poly-A and was written as the normal number) while that of BAC

453

is 8,219 bp, written as the number in parentheses starting from the CMV promoter. The BToV-derived

454

sequences of each fragment correspond to nt 1 to 4,497 (BToV-A), nt 4,139 to 8,512 (BToV-B), nt 8,301 to

455

12,748 (BToV-C), nt 12,413 to 16,612 (BToV-D), nt 16,444 to 20,731(BToV-E), nt 20,512 to 24,877 (BToV-F), nt

456

24,675 to 28,196 (BToV-G), and nt 27,987 to 28,313 (BToV-H), respectively. The 5' terminal hm of the BToV-A

457

fragment and the other fragments were regions of a partial CMV promoter, (205) to (605), and regions

458

overlapping between the fragments, respectively. The 3' terminal hm of all fragments is the region including

459

Rz and BGH, which is (606) to (1,001) (Fig. 1A). Fragments BToV-A to -G were prepared using standard PCR

460

protocols with the overlap extension technique (72). Fragment BToV-H was prepared through PCR using a

461

plasmid template containing a chemically synthesized BToV sequence between nt 27,987 to 28,313, 25 nt of

462

adenine (pA), and the hm of the 3' terminal sequence described above (Eurofins, Luxembourg, Luxembourg).

All fragments were amplified using KOD Plus Neo (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) and purified with gel-extraction

and phenol-chloroform extraction before electroporation. After assembly of the eight fragments, BAC

465

carrying the cDNA clone of the full-length BToV (pBAC-BToVmut1) contained three mutations, namely, two

466

single mutations at nt G3399T (E871D in NSP1 protein) and at nt T8469G (silent), and the E. coli

467

chromosomal derived sequence of 1,350 bp was inserted at nt 10,136 (Fig. 2A). pRed/ET recombination

468

method could revert two substitutions but failed to delete the E. coli chromosomal derived sequence. To delete

469

this sequence in vitro, type IIS restriction enzyme SapI (New England Biolabs), which recognizes asymmetric

470

DNA sequences and cleave outsides their 5’-GCTCTTCN↓NNN -3’ recognition site, was used. First, two SapI

471

sites at nt (4,526) and (5,736) near or in the SopA gene of BAC plasmid were removed by introducing single

472

mutations, 5’-(4,526) GCTCTTC → CCTCTTC and 5’-(5,736) GCTCTTC → GGTCTTC respectively, using

473

NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and two NgoMVI restriction sites located

474

outside the two SapI sites at nt (3,633) and (7,549). Next, SapI recognition sites were inserted on both sides

475

(one in the reverse direction) of the E. coli chromosomal derived sequence by pRed/ET recombination. Finally,

476

the resulting BAC plasmid (pBAC-BToVmut2) was treated with SapI and was subjected to in vitro self-ligation

477

(pBAC-BToVpre). pBAC-BToVpre was electroporated into NEB10ß and was successfully propagated.

478
479

BAC construction of mutant BToVs

480

To introduce mutations into the HE gene of pBAC-BToVpre, the rpsL/Neo cassette was inserted through the

481

5' terminal hm including a partial M gene, nt 26,037 to 26,249 and the 3' terminal hm including 3’-UTR,

482

poly(A), Rz, and BGH, 28,150 to (1,001), using pRed/ET recombination (Fig. 2B). The resulting BAC with the

483

rpsL/Neo cassette (pBAC-BToVHE/N-rpsL/Neo) allows manipulation of not only the HE gene but also the N gene.

484

The rpsL/Neo cassette was replaced with the mutated HE gene or with the Enhanced Green Fluorescent

485

Protein (EGFP) gene (Fig. 2B).

486

Cell-adapted wtBToV in our laboratory lost full-length HE (HEf) due to a stop codon at nt 481 (the base

487

number of HE gene), CAG (Q)→TAG (stop), resulting in the soluble form HE 160 aa in length (HEs) (36, 37)

488

(Fig. 3A). Using pBAC-BToVHE/N-rpsL/Neo, four pBAC plasmids were created; pBAC-BToV with two genetic

489

markers at nt T207C (T26530C) and nt T228A (T26554A), pBAC-BToV-HEf with the replacement of a stop

490

codon (TAG) to CAG to express full-length HE, pBAC-BToV-HEs/HA and pBAC-BToV-HEf/HA with the

491

addition of HA-tag at the C-terminal end of HEs and HEf proteins, respectively. pBAC-BToV-HEf/HA had the

HE gene mutation at nt 1,029, GAATTC→GAACTC (silent) to remove the EcoRI site. In addition, pBAC-

493

BToV-EGFP in which the HE gene was completely replaced with EGFP was created. All BAC plasmids were

494

purified with NucleoBond Xtra Maxi (Macherey-Nagel, Dueren, Germany) from 1,000mL cultured E. coli

495

cells.

Rescue of recombinant BToVs

498

293T and HRT18 cells were seeded into 24-well plates at 1.5 × 105 and 2.0 × 105 cells/well, respectively, on

499

the day before the experiment. 293T cells were transfected with 2.0 μg pBAC-BToV or -HE mutant and -

500

EGFP with 1.5 μL Lipofectamine 3000 and 1.0 μL P3000 Regent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated at

501

37°C. The next day, DMEM(+) was replaced with 500 μL DMEM(-) to remove FBS. After 3 dpt, supernatants

502

were harvested. The 50 μL supernatant was inoculated to susceptible HRT18 cells which had been washed

503

with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) twice after which 450 μL DMEM (-) was added. After 2 dpi,

504

supernatants were harvested and viruses were plaque-purified three times. A 20 μL aliquot from the 100 μL

505

plaque suspension was added to HRT18 cells with 480 μL DMEM(-) in 24-well plates, and the supernatant

506

was harvested after 2 dpi. This was stored at -70°C as a master virus. Next, 100 μL of the master viruses

507

were expanded on HRT18 cells with 10 mL DMEM(-) in a 10 cm dish, and these viruses were harvested after

508

the appropriate CPE was observed. These were stored as passage 0 (P0) viruses, which were used for

509

subsequent experiments. In the case of rEGFP, plaque purification of some recombinant viruses (No.3 to

510

No.6) were omitted because of EGFP gene instability. 293T cells prepared on a 3 cm dish were transfected

511

with 5 times reagent volumes and pBAC-BToV-EGFP. The 2.5 mL supernatants of transfected HRT18 cells

512

were inoculated into the cells in a 10 cm dish to expand the viruses, and these viruses were then harvested.

513

In this case, these were used as passage 0 (P0) viruses. The nomenclature of recombinant BToV rescued from

514

these BAC plasmids was rBToV(rHEs), rHEf, rHEs/HA, rHEf/HA and rEGFP, respectively (Fig. 3A).

Immunofluorescence staining

517

A 35 mm glass base dish (12 mm glass area) (Iwaki, Shizuoka, Japan) was seeded with 1.0 × 105 HRT18 cells,

518

the day before the experiment. Cells were washed twice with PBS and infected with 300 μL recombinant

519

BToV in DMEM(-) with a MOI of 0.05. After 24 hpi (and 36 hpi only for the rEGFP), infected cells were

520

washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature (rt), and were

permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min at RT. Cells were incubated with mouse anti-HE, anti-M

522

antiserum, or rabbit and mouse anti-HA antibodies at 4°C overnight, and were then incubated with a mixed

523

FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse or mixed AlexaFluorTM 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse for mouse

524

antiserum and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies for rabbit antibody, for 2 h at rt. Cell nuclei were

525

stained with Hoechst 33258 solution (Dojindo) for 20 min at rt. PBS washing was done twice between each

526

step. Stained cells were observed under confocal laser scanning microscopy using an LSM 710 laser scanning

527

microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).

α-naphthyl acetate esterase activity

530

HRT18 cells grown in 24-well plates were infected with recombinant BToVs with a MOI of 0.05. At 24 hpi,

531

cells were fixed with fixative solution, stained for a α-naphthyl acetate esterase with a α-NA esterase staining

532

kit (Muto Pure Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and observed under

533

phase-contrast microscopy.

535

Immunoblotting

536

HRT18 cells grown in 24-well plates were infected with the recombinant BToVs with a MOI of 0.05. COS7

537

cells were transfected with 1.0 μg pCAGGS-HEf or pCAGGS-HEs with 1.5 μL Lipofectamine 3000 and 2.0 μl

538

P3000 Regent. At 24 hpi (and 36 hpi only for rEGFP), infected HRT18 cells and 40 hpt transfected COS7 cells

539

were lysed with 100 μL sample buffer (50 mM Tris, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 10% glycerol, and 1%

540

2-mercaptoethanol) and were boiled for 5 min. N protein, EGFP, and HA-tagged proteins of samples were

541

analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and were transferred to

542

a PVDF membrane (Merck Millipore, Tokyo, Japan). The membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-N

543

antiserum or mouse anti-GFP antibody, and then with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse

544

antibodies, respectively. To detect HA-tagged proteins, mouse-anti-HA 12CA5 antibody for HA-tagged HEf

545

and rabbit anti-HA antibody for HA-tagged HEs were used because of differences in their reactivity. Protein

546

bands were visualized with ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (GE Healthcare, IL, USA) on a

547

Light Capture II instrument (ATTO, Tokyo, Japan).

Growth kinetics of recombinant BToVs

550

HRT18 cells in 24-well plates were washed twice with PBS and were infected with recombinant BToVs with

551

a MOI of 0.001. After 1.5 h adsorption at 37°C, unadsorbed viruses were removed and cells were washed

552

twice with PBS, and 0.5 mL DMEM(-) was added. Viruses in the supernatant were collected at 2, 24, 48, and

553

72 hpi and the supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. Virus titers in the

554

culture media were determined in a 96-well plate by TCID50, as previously described (73).

555
556

Measurement of the stability of HE and EGFP gene

557

HRT18 cells in a 24-well plate were washed twice with PBS after which 0.5 mL DMEM(-) was added; these

558

were then infected with recombinant BToVs with a MOI of 0.001. After the appropriate CPE was observed (2

559

to 3 dpi), the supernatant was harvested and 0.5 uL was inoculated to the fresh cells, resulting in a serial

560

passages by 1,000-fold diluted virus. To estimate stability of the HEf and EGFP genes during serial passages,

561

HRT18 cells in a 24-well plate were infected with rHEf and rHEf/HA harvested at the indicated passage

562

history with a MOI of 0.05, and cells at 24 hpi were subjected to an α-NA esterase assay or to immunoblotting

563

of N proteins. EGFP-expression of the infected cells with rEGFP were monitored during serial passages under

564

a fluorescence microscope (Olympus CKX41 U-RFLT50; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Later, images of cells

565

infected with rEGFP harvested at the indicated passage history at the same conditions were taken, and

566

EGFP and N proteins were detected by immunoblotting. Supernatants of the infected cells (resulting in +1

567

passage history) were subjected to RNA extraction, RT-PCR, and sequencing described above. PCR fragments

568

of 1130 and 1630 bp containing HE and EGFP genes, respectively, were amplified using Takara ExTaq

569

(Takara) under the following conditions [94°C, 5min; 30 cycles of (94°C, 30 s; 50°C, 30 s; 72°C, 1 min/kb);

570

72°C 10min]. DNase treatment was also performed before RNA extraction to digest BAC plasmid from

571

transfection, depending on passage history.
