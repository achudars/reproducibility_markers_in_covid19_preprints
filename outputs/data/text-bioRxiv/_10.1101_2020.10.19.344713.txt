Abstract
The ongoing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has
acutely highlighted the need to identify new treatment strategies for viral infections. Here we
present a pivotal molecular mechanism of viral protein translation that relies on the mitochondrial
5

translation machinery. We found that rare codons such as Leu-TTA are highly enriched in many
viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and these codons are essential for the regulation of viral protein
expression. SARS-CoV-2 controls the translation of its spike gene by hijacking host mitochondria
through 5’ leader and 3’UTR sequences that contain mitochondrial localization signals and
activate the EGR1 pathway. Mitochondrial-targeted drugs such as lonidamine and polydatin

10

significantly repress rare codon-driven gene expression and viral replication. This study identifies
an unreported viral protein translation mechanism and opens up a novel avenue for developing
antiviral drugs.

Main Text:
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent responsible
for the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, has killed more than one million people in around 200
5

countries since its identification in December 2019. There are currently three main categories of
anti-viral drug being assessed for use in COVID-19 patients: viral replication inhibitors that target
viral proteins; drugs that block host cell proteins involved in viral infection, and reagents that
balance host immune responses to infection(1, 2). Unfortunately, effective antiviral drugs are still
lacking. Recently the interaction network of viral proteins(3), the global landscape of host gene

10

expression(4, 5) and host and viral phosphoproteomics(6) after SARS-CoV-2 infection have been
reported and this information may accelerate the screening of potential antiviral agents. However,
the detailed mechanisms by which viral genes interact with host cell intracellular compartments
remain largely unknown. Defining these mechanisms is important not only for understanding viral
pathogenesis but also for designing new antiviral therapeutics.

15

Given the degeneracy of the genetic code, all amino acids are coded by 2-6 synonymous codons
that are not used with equal frequency. Codon usage bias, the preference for certain synonymous
codons for each amino acid, is a universal feature of all genomes and plays an important role in
determination of gene expression levels. A positive correlation between codon usage bias and
tRNA expression allows more efficient translation of genes enriched in optimal codons compared

20

to those enriched in rare codons(7). The presence of optimal codons has been associated with an
enhanced rate of translation elongation, the control of ribosome traffic on the mRNA and
regulation of proper co-translational protein folding(8). Understanding the codon usage bias in
different organisms has implications for future therapeutic design.

Most viruses have compact genomes lacking transfer RNA (tRNA) coding sequences, thus
translation of viral proteins is completely reliant on host cell translation machinery(9). Recent
studies have demonstrated that viruses can effectively manipulate host tRNAs to better match viral
codon usage, presenting a promising target for restriction of viral replication(10, 11).
5

SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded, positive-sense group β coronavirus, with a genome of around
30kbp (12). The virus genome contains 10 open-reading frames (ORFs) that encode four structural
proteins: Spike (S), Membrane (M), Envelope (E) and the nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and six nonstructural proteins ORF1ab, ORF3, ORF6, ORF7, ORF8 and ORF10 (13). We found that the
native sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) gene expressed protein at an extremely low level

10

after transfection of recombinant plasmid into human cells, but expression was significantly
improved after codon optimization of the S protein gene (Fig. 1A)(14). To better understand the
protein expression pattern of SARS-CoV-2, protein abundance of the four structural proteins (S,
E, M and N) and four accessory proteins (ORF3, ORF6, ORF7 and ORF8) was evaluated and we
found that the protein expression of M, N, ORF3 and ORF7 could be readily detected in human

15

cells after the transfection of a plasmid expressing native gene sequences, while the abundance of
S, E, ORF6 and ORF8 were low, with no observed positive band when the native gene sequences
were used (Fig. 1B). These results were corroborated using immunofluorescence, in which the
viral ORFs were fused with RFP using an IRES motif (15) (Fig. S1). These findings indicate that
several key genes of SARS-CoV-2 show codon usage bias and dissection of the underlying

20

mechanisms responsible may provide a new direction for targeting of antiviral drugs.
To confirm SARS-CoV-2 codon usage, the rare codon usage preference among SARS-CoV-2 and
humans were analyzed using the GCUA tool. As expected, viral proteins with low-abundance (S,
E, ORF6, ORF8) were more highly enriched in rare codons than highly expressed proteins (M, N,

ORF3, ORF7) (Fig. 1C). Several rare codons, especially those encoding Leucine (Leu), were
present in higher numbers and proportion in low-abundance proteins (Fig. 1D & 1E). Sequence
analysis revealed that the 5’ signal peptide of the S protein possesses several rare Leu codons. To
validate the effect of these rare codons on S protein expression, the wild-type signal peptide or
5

codon-optimized signal peptide, in which the four rare codons were replaced with a human
optimized codon Leu-CTG, were fused in frame with the codon-optimized receptor binding
domain (RBD) of S, which is responsible for interactions with the angiotensin converting enzyme
2 (ACE2) receptor to mediate viral cell entry. RBD domain protein expression was significantly
improved by codon optimisation (Fig. 1F), suggesting that the presence of the tRNAs required for

10

decoding low-usage Leu codons may be crucial for translation of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and as
such, a potential intervention target.
Considering the importance of tRNAs in translation, genome analysis of TRL-TAA (the tRNA
specific for Leu, expressing the TAA anticodon) revealed a strong signal of transcriptional factor
(TF) binding and histone modification around TRL-TAA (Fig. 2A). Potential virus-associated TFs

15

interacting with TRL-TAA promoter were predicted with JASPAR software (Tables S1), and 25
elevated TFs were identified (Fig. 2B & C), indicating these TFs may affect the translation of viral
genes enriched in rare codons. Subsequently, the top candidate, early growth response 1 (EGR1),
was evaluated for a role in rare codon usage. Despite previous studies demonstrating that host
EGR1 induced by Vaccinia virus or cytomegalovirus infection enhances virus replication and

20

infectivity (16, 17), EGR1 overexpression in HEK293 cells was only able to slightly increase S
protein expression with wild type sequence (Fig. 2D). To further investigate the potential accessory
TFs of SARS-CoV-2 infection, signalling pathway enrichment was performed to identify the
relationship of those genes with increased expression in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (GSE147507).

Data showed these genes were mainly clustered in pathways including TNF signalling, cytokine
production, ATF2 pathway and inflammatory response (Fig. 2E). However, overexpression of
activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) had no significant effect on S expression (Fig. 2D),despite
the promoter of TRL-TAA also contains potential binding sites for ATF2 (Tables S1). Interestingly,
5

the data of human single-cell transcriptome analysis experiments revealed that most of these TFs
were enriched in ACE2- and TMPRSS2-positive cells (18), especially in ciliated cells and
pneumocytes, SARS-CoV-2 target cells (Fig. 2F) (19, 20).
Given that after natural infection, intrinsic S protein expression levels in virus-infected cells are
high(5), we hypothesized that there may be other mechanisms that regulate the protein expression

10

of S and other genes with rare codons. To confirm this, enrichment analysis was performed using
genes reported to interact with S (3). As shown in Fig. 3A, these proteins were mainly clustered
to protein folding, mRNA splicing and protein translation functions, in particular proteins involved
in the process of mitochondrial gene translation.
Eukaryotic cells possess two distinct translation machineries; the cytosolic system that synthesises

15

the majority of proteins within the cell, and the mitochondrial system, specialised for the
production of the mitochondrial proteins (21). Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that control
a wide range of cellular processes, including ATP generation, cellular differentiation, apoptosis
and anti-viral immune activation(22). The human mitochondrial genome contains only 37 genes,
of which two are ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), 22 tRNAs and 13 protein-coding genes. Mammalian

20

mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has neither introns nor protective histones, has a high AT content
and as a consequence of the small genome size, employs only a small number of tRNAs which are
responsible for decoding a large number of codons (21), suggesting that mitochondria show a
different codon usage preference from the nuclear genome (21, 23). We performed a comparison

of codon usage bias and demonstrated that the key rare codon rate in SARS-CoV-2 and S protein
were highly similar to the rate seen in mitochondrial genes, and these rates were much higher than
found in the human nuclear genome (Fig. 3B). Recently, the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome revealed
that nearly half of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs had 5’ leader sequence (or 5’ untranslated regions, 5’UTR),
5

and both the 5‘- and 3' UTRs of SARS-CoV-2 had potential mitochondrial localization signals(24).
Dats showed that S protein expression was significantly strengthened in human HEK293 kidney
cells by adding the 5’-and 3’UTR sequences to the native S gene in the expression plasmid (Fig.
3C). Moreover, this mitochondrial-dependent protein translation could be further enhanced by
overexpression of EGR1 and ATF2 in cells (Fig. 3D), and both proteins have been shown to be

10

related with the function of mitochondria (25, 26). To prove further that mitochondrial localization
was necessary for effective viral protein translation, two reported mitochondrial RNA targeting
signals (Rnase P binding motif, RP and MRP binding motif, MRP) were inserted upstream of the
SARS-CoV-2 S, E or ORF8 genes (Fig.3E). The protein level of S and ORF8 with RP or MRP
motif were significantly enhanced, although no effect was found regarding expression of E protein

15

with either mitochondrial targeting signal (Fig. 3F). Recently, our results showed that E may play
a greater role in viral transcription regulation (data not shown), and this also explained why SARSCoV without E could still replicate in Vero E6 cells(27).
To investigate whether mitochondrial-dependent protein translation was a general principle for the
translation of viral proteins, codon bias of 17 viruses including 12 RNA viruses and five DNA

20

viruses were analysed. Impressively, all viruses analysed adopted a codon preference that was
more similar to mitochondria (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the fiber capsid protein of adenovirus type 11
(Ad11) which contained rare codons, in particular L-TAA and L-CTT (Fig.4B) and strikingly,
modifying the fiber of Ad11 with the MRP motif to enhance mitochondrial localisation was able

to increase protein expression compared to expression from the native fiber gene sequence (Fig.
4C). These findings suggest a novel viral protein translation mechanism that relies on manipulation
of the mitochondrial translation apparatus.
Lonidamine and Polydatin are two well-characterised anti-cancer therapeutics that target
5

mitochondrial pathways to induce cancer cell-death. Treatment with these two drugs significantly
repressed Ad11 virus replication (Fig. 4D) and SARS-CoV-2 S protein expression (Fig. 4E) in
vitro. Interestingly, during the preparation of this manuscript, two Polydatin analogs, Resveratrol
and Pterostilbene, both also modulators of mitochondrial function, have been confirmed to have
anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity at a time point between the viral entry and release of the virion(28).

10

Moreover, another mitochondrion-related drug, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) was also found to
prevent the replication of SARS-COV-2 in Caco-2 cells (5). All these findings support the findings
presented here regarding the importance of mitochondria for viral protein translation and
demonstrate that mitochondria are a promising target for development of antiviral drugs. Both
Lonidamine and Polydatin have been tested in human Phase II or III clinical trials for cancer

15

treatment and have demonstrated good safety (29). This study suggests that immediate clinical
trials for testing their application for SARS-COV-2 and other viral infections are warranted.
In summary, this study has clarified the influence of codon bias on the abundance of rare codonrich viral proteins such as SARS-CoV-2 S and Ad11 fiber. It has previously been shown that
viruses actively interfere with mitochondrial pathways to impede mitochondrial anti-viral

20

signalling mechanisms(30). Indeed, SARS-CoV-1 ORF-9b has been demonstrated to localise to
mitochondria to manipulate mitochondrial function and suppress anti-viral signalling. The
resultant mitochondrial stress also promotes the formation of mitochondrion-derived vesicles that
can act as a replication niche for the virus (31, 32). Here, for the first time, we disclose that

mitochondrial hijacking by viruses and mitochondria localisation of viral RNA are essential for
the translation of viral proteins (Fig. 4F). This undoubtedly expands our understanding of the role
of mitochondria in viral infections and provides a new insight for the development of antiviral
drugs.

Cells and transfection
Human kidney cell line HEK-293 and lung cancer cell line A549 were purchased from the Cell
5

Bank of Type Culture Collection Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. All cells were
cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM high glucose, Gibco) containing 10%
FBS (Biological Industries) and at 37 ℃ in 5% CO2 incubator. For transient overexpression assays,
logarithmically growing cell lines were seeded into 6-well plates, then 3 ug of plasmids expressing
SARS-CoV-2 sequence or vector were transfected with 5 μL jetPEI (Polyplus, USA) according to

10

the manufacturer’s instructions. Six hours later, medium was refreshed and cells were harvested
for further experiments 36 h after transfection. For drug treatment assays, fresh medium containing
DMSO (Sigma, USA), 10 μM polydatin (MCE,USA) or 10 μM lonidamine (MCE,USA) was used
after transfection.
Protein isolation and western blot assay

Total cell protein was isolated with RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris • HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% SDS, 150
mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM NaF) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture
(Roche, USA). After centrifugation at 13000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C, 20-30 μg protein was
separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, USA). After being
blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 1 hour, membranes were incubated with the indicated primary

2×105 A549 cells were seeded into 12-wells plates and infected with Ad11 virus (MOI=0.5) in
serum-free medium. 2 hours later, medium was refreshed with 2% fetal calf serum containing
DMSO or 10 μM mitochondria-targeted drugs. All cells and medium were harvested at 72 hours
after infection, then frozen and thawed three times. The amounts of virus in cell lysates were
measured with HEK-293 cell as previously described(35).

Bioinformatics analysis
The differences in codon usage preference between SARS-CoV-2-derived protein coding
sequences and human were analyzed using GCUA tools. The codon usage table of mitochondrial
and other viruses used in this study were downloaded from the Codon Usage Database
(http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/). Public gene expression data for SARS-CoV-2-infected cells

20

(GSE147507) were obtained from the GEO database, and the differentially expressed genes and
heatmap of selected genes were analyzed with R studio. Potential TFs on the promoter (upstream
1000bp) of TRL-TAA-4-1 were predicted with JASPAR software (relative profile score threshold
was 80%) and Venny 2.1 software was used to performed the gene overlap analysis. The signalling
pathway and functional enrichment analysis of related genes were performed with Metascape. The
