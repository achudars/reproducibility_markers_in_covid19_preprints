Abstract: Development of effective antiviral drugs targeting the severe acute respiratory
syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are urgently needed to combat the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Oxysterols, defined as oxidized derivatives of cholesterol, include

endogenous (naturally occurring) cholesterol metabolites as well as semi-synthetic oxysterol
derivatives.

We have previously studied the use of semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives as

drug candidates for inhibition of cancer, fibrosis, and bone regeneration.

In this study, we

have screened a panel of naturally occurring and semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives for antiSARS-CoV-2 activity, using a cell culture infection assay.
7-ketocholesterol,

22(R)-hydroxycholesterol,

We show that the natural oxysterols,

24(S)-hydroxycholesterol,

and

27-

hydroxycholesterol, substantially inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation in cultured cells.
Among semi-synthetic oxysterols, Oxy186 displayed antiviral activity comparable to natural
oxysterols.

In addition, related oxysterol analogues Oxy210 and Oxy232 displayed more

robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities, reducing viral replication more than 90% at 10 µM and 99%
at 15 µM, respectively.

When orally administered in mice, peak plasma concentrations of

Oxy210 fall into a therapeutically relevant range (19 µM), based on the dose-dependent curve
for antiviral activity in our cell culture infection assay.

Oxy210 reduced replication of SARS-CoV-2 with disrupting the formation of double membrane
vesicles (DMVs), intracellular membrane compartments associated with viral replication.
Oxy210 also inhibited the replication of hepatitis C virus, another RNA virus whose replication
is associated with DMVs, but not the replication of the DMV-independent hepatitis D virus.
Our study warrants further evaluation of Oxy210 and Oxy232 as a safe and reliable oral
medication, which could help protect vulnerable populations with increased risk developing
COVID-19.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory
syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has drastically impacted public health and, on a
global scale, caused enormous harm to human societies and their economic vitality.

In the

search for effective treatments for COVID-19, understandably, the repurposing of existing FDAapproved drugs has been given high priority due to their known safety profiles [1].

For example,

remdesivir (RDV), which was originally designed as an anti-ebola virus agent, has been
repurposed to become the first and, to date, the only FDA-approved drug treatment for SARSCoV-2 infection.

Similarly, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which are used to control

malaria, have been investigated as COVID-19 treatments [2].

Beyond drug repurposing [3],

other approaches are urgently needed to invigorate discovery research for new, specific, and
potent anti-COVID-19 drugs.
Naturally occurring oxysterols include metabolites of cholesterol involved in the biosynthesis of
steroid hormones, vitamin D, bile acids and other crucial signaling molecules [4, 5].

Beyond

their role as passive and transient metabolites, endogenous oxysterols are increasingly
recognized as lipid signaling molecules that can regulate a range of physiological processes,
including lipid homeostasis, transport and metabolism as well as immune response [5].

In

recent years, numerous reports have ascribed broad spectrum antiviral properties to naturally
occurring oxysterols.

For example, 20(S)-hydroxycholesterol [20(S)-OHC] and 22(S)-

hydroxycholesterol [22(S)-OHC] reduced the infection of hepatitis B virus [6]; 25hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) displayed antiviral activities
against herpes simplex virus [7], human papillomavirus-16, human rhinovirus [8], murine
norovirus [9], rotavirus [10], and zika virus [11].

In this study, we focused on oxysterols, including naturally occurring and semi-synthetic
oxysterols, to identify potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, since we have already developed various
semi-synthetic oxysterols as drug candidates in the context of cancer, fibrotic diseases and bone
regeneration: Oxy133, an allosteric activator of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling, was designed for
orthopedic applications, such as bone repair and spine fusion [12-14]; Oxy186, an inhibitor of Hh
signaling that acts downstream of the Smoothened (Smo) receptor, was designed as a potential
anti-tumorigenic agent [15], and Oxy210 was designed for application in cancer and fibrosis
through dual inhibition of Hh and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b) signaling [16].

In

the present report, using cell-based analysis, we demonstrate that Oxy210 and its analogue,
Oxy232, display superior anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity compared to the natural oxysterols, 7ketocholesterol (7-KC), 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol [22(R)-OHC], 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol [24(S)OHC], and 27-OHC.

Importantly, Oxy210 reduced viral replication and the formation of double

membrane vesicles (DMVs), known RNA replication factories of coronaviruses and other RNA
viruses [17-19].

Oral administration of a single dose of Oxy210 at 200 mg/kg in mice resulted in

a peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of about 19 µM, which exceeds both the IC50 (5.6 µM) and IC90
(8.6 µM), respectively, determined in our cell-based assay.

These data provide foundational

evidence for Oxy210 and Oxy232 as potential anti-COVID-19 candidates for further therapeutic
development in the future.

2. Results
2.1 Natural oxysterols have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection
In this study, we used a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 infection system previously reported [20].

This

infection system uses VeroE6 cells stably overexpressing the TMPRSS2 gene, which is a member
of type II transmembrane serine proteases.

Cells were treated with test compounds for 1 h

during inoculation with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of
0.001, followed by washing out free virus and incubating the cells with test compounds for 24 h
or 48 h (Figure. 1A and Materials and Methods).

SARS-CoV-2 propagation in VeroE6/TMPRSS2

cells induced a cytopathic effect (CPE) at 48 h post-virus inoculation (Figure. 1B, panel b), and
the treatment with remdesivir (RDV), a known replication inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 [2], blocked
the virus-induced CPE (Figure. 1B, panel c).

SARS-CoV-2 propagation visualised by detecting

viral nucleocapside (N) protein by immunofluorescence (IF) analysis was also blocked by RDV
(Figure. 1C, panels b and c, red).

Using this assay, we evaluated the antiviral effect of cholesterol

and 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC) as a representative of natural oxysterols.

7-KC, but not cholesterol,

reduced the SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE (Figure. 1B, panels d and e) and the spread of infection
(Figure. 1C, panels d and e).

To quantify antiviral activity, we measured viral RNA production

in the culture supernatant, and cell viability upon treatment with natural oxysterols or cholesterol
at 24 h post-inoculation.

Cholesterol, 4beta-hydroxysterol (4beta-OHC) and 22(S)-

hydroxycholesterol [22(S)-OHC], did not show apparent reductions in viral RNA, while 7-KC,
22(R)-hydroxycholesterol

[22(R)-OHC],

24(S)-hydroxycholesterol

[24(S)-OHC],

and

27-

hydroxysterol (27-OHC) reduced the production of viral RNA by 80-86% as compared to control
(Figure 1D and supplementary Figure. S1).

Evaluation of host cell viability showed no cytotoxic

effect of the test compounds up to 30 µM, which is the maximum concentration in the SARS-CoV2 infection assay shown in Figure. 1D, (Figure. 1E).

These findings suggest that the oxysterols

inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation without showing cytotoxicity.

2.2 Semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives, Oxy210, Oxy186 and Oxy232 inhibit the SARS-CoV2 production
Although the natural oxysterols, 7-KC, 22(R)-OHC, 24(S)-OHC, and 27-OHC showed modest
anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities, their physiological concentrations are at far below µM ranges [21, 22]
in the circulation of healthy humans, suggesting their limited role, if any, in preventing viral
infection in physiological condition.

In search for oxysterols with improved antiviral activity,

we evaluated the potential of semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition.
SARS-CoV-2-induced CPE and virus propagation were blocked when treated with Oxy210 but
not Oxy133 (Figure. 2A and 2B, panels d and e).

Quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the

culture supernatant at 24 h post-inoculation also showed that Oxy210 and its structurally related
derivatives, Oxy186 and Oxy232, reduced viral RNA level in a dose-dependent manner, while
Oxy133 did not show antiviral activity up to 15 µM (Figure 2C).

The antiviral activity of Oxy186

was almost equivalent to that of the natural oxysterols shown earlier; the maximum reduction in
viral RNA was 83% when used at 12 µM as compared to control (Figure 2C, note that the viral
RNA shown in logarithm scale).

On the other hand, Oxy210 and Oxy232 showed much higher

antiviral potencies; viral RNA production was reduced by 99.4% (Oxy210) and 99.9% (Oxy232)
at the maximum at 15 µM (Figure 2C).

No significant cytotoxicity by Oxy186 and Oxy210 was

found up to 15 µM, the maximum concentration in the infection assay, however, Oxy232 slightly
reduced cell viability when used at concentrations above 10 µM (Figure 2D).

Due to the greater

availability of Oxy210 we performed further studies with this oxysterol analogue.

The 50% and

90% maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50, IC90) and 50% maximal cytotoxic concentration
(CC50) of Oxy210 were 5.6 µM, 8.6 µM, and >15 µM, respectively.
We previously reported that Oxy210 inhbited Hedgehog (Hh) and transforming growth factor b
(TGFb) signalings in fibroblastic cells and tumor cells [16].

In contrast, Oxy232, a close structural

analogue of Oxy210, is devoid of significant TGFb inhibitory properties (Figure 2E), but retains

inhibitory activity toward Hh signaling (Figure 2F), suggesting that inhibition of TGFb signaling
is not resposible for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity.

Consistent with this observation, treatment

with the TGFb signaling inhibitor, SB431542, did not significantly inhibit the production of viral
RNA (Figure 2G).

In addition, inactivation of Hh pathway by either HPI-1 or GDC0449 did not

decrease the viral RNA levels (Figure 2G).

These data suggest that Oxy210, Oxy232 and other

antiviral oxysterol analogues inhibit SARS-CoV-2 production independent of the inhibition of Hh
or TGFb signaling pathways.

2.3 Oxy210 inhibits the intracellular SARS-CoV-2 replication and formation of double
membrane vesicles
To determine which steps in the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle (Figure. 3A, left) were inhibited by
Oxy210, we performed a time of addition assay (Figure. 3A, upper right).

We examined the

antiviral effect of Oxy210 in three different experimental groups, with different compound
treatment times (Figure. 3A, a-c); (a) Compounds were treated during the 1 h virus inoculation
and the additional 23 h up to detection to represent the whole life cycle (a, blue); (b) Compounds
were present during the 1 h virus inoculation and an additional 2 h, and then removed to
represent the virus entry process (b, green); and (c) Compounds were added 2 h after virus
inoculation and were present for the remaining 21 h to represent the post-entry period (c, orange).
We confirmed that Chloroquine (CLQ), a reported SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitor that acts through
modulation of intracellular pH [2, 23, 24], showed the most inhibitory effect when introduced in
the entry-step of infection (Figure 3A, lower right, lane 8).

[Because of the multiple rounds of

viral re-infection in our assay, entry inhibitors can also show antiviral effects when introduced at
post-entry (Figure 3A, lower right, lane 9)].

We also confirmed the mode of action of RDV, a

reported inhibitor of intracellular viral RNA replication [25], by showing no significant effect on
the virus entry-step (Figure 3A, lower right, lane 5) and a remarkable inhibition of post-entry
phase (Figure 3A, lower right, lane 6) .

In this assay system, Oxy210, but not the negative control

Oxy133, clearly reduced viral RNA levels when present during the whole life cycle and the postentry, but not at the entry phase, similar to the effects of RDV (Figure 3A, lower right, lanes 1012).

This finding suggests that Oxy210 targets intracellular virus replication, rather than viral

entry.
Coronaviruses generally induce the formation of unique membrane compartments, called double
membrane vesicles (DMVs), which enables an efficient viral RNA replication [18, 26].

We found

that DMV formation occurs with infection by SARS-CoV-2 in VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells (Figure. 3B,
panels b and e, *).

Interestingly, treatment with Oxy210 remarkably reduced the DMV

formation in the SARS-CoV-2-infected cells (Figure. 3B, panels c and f, *).

5

We examined the

speficicity of Oxy210’s effect on DMV dependent virus replication by evaluating the antiviral
effect on hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV), which are other RNA viruses that
drive replication in a DMV-dependent and -independent manner, respectively [26, 27].

Similar

to the effect of an HCV polymerase inhibitor, sofosbuvir, used as a positive control, Oxy210
reduced the DMV-dependent RNA replication of HCV (Figure 3C), while the antiviral activity
was not observed in HDV infection that was inhibited by the positive control, MyrB (Figure 3D).
These data are consistent with the idea that Oxy210 specifically inhibits the DMV-dependent
virus replication, although it remains to be determined whether Oxy210 directly inhibits the
DMV formation machinery, which we will examine in future studies (see the discussion below).

2.4 Pharmacokinetics of Oxy210 in mice
Given its higher anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency compared to the natural oxysterols, we questioned
whether oral administration of Oxy210 in mice would result in plasma concentrations high
enough to sustain significant antiviral activity in vivo.

According to a previously established

protocol [16], a single dose of Oxy210 at 200 mg/kg was orally administered to mice and the
plasma concentration examined at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours (h).
by the mice in this experiment.

Oxy210 was well tolerated

After 1 h (Tmax), Oxy210 reached a peak plasma concentration

(Cmax) of 8,155 ng/mL (19.4 µM) with an overall exposure of 29,305 h*ng/mL, as measured by the
area under the curve (AUC) (Figure. 4)
In a separate study, Oxy210 was administered to mice via a chow diet containing 4 mg Oxy210/g
of food.

Oxy210 plasma concentrations were measured at 24, 48, and 96 h.

or significant loss of body weight was recorded during this 96 h experiment.

No adverse effects
Accumulation of

Oxy210 in plasma was greatest after 96 h, averaging at 2,682 ng/mL (6.4 µM) (Supplementary
Table. S1).

The concentration in the liver and the lung after 96 h was higher at 6,869 ng/mL (16.3

µM) and 4,137 ng/mL (9.8 µM), respectively (Supplementary Table. S1).

These

pharmacokinetics data indicate that oral administration of Oxy210 in mice, via oral gavage or
mixed into a chow diet, results in plasma and lung concentrations that could sustain signifcant
anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vivo.

3. Discussion
In this study, we have evaluated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of a collection of naturally
occurring and semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives in cell cultures.

Oxysterols are a class of

understudied molecules that, until recently, have rarely been considered as a source of
therapeutic drug candidates.

In fact, most naturally occurring oxysterols cannot be ideal drug

candidates for several different reasons, such as metabolic instability and overlapping biological
activities.

For example, 25-OHC , in addition to its antiviral properties, can also amplify the

activation of immune cells and increases the production of potentially harmful immune
mediators which are linked to the development of atherosclerosis [5].

Semi-synthetic oxysterol

derivatives, by contrast, often posess improved drug like properties, in terms of potency,
selectivity, metabolic stability and drug safety characteristics, compared to their naturally
occuring counterparts.

Given the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, we seek to establish a

suitable drug development candidate with potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity that does not elicit
unrelated or untoward pharmacological responses.

In this study, Oxy210, a semi-synthetic

oxysterol, was identified as a potent replication inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 which reduced the
formation of DMVs.

The peak plasma concentration of Oxy210 reached after administration via

oral gavage (19 µM) and the plasma (6.4 µM) and lung (9.8 µM) concentrations reached after
administration through diet, fall into a therapeutically meaningful range as they approach or
exceed the IC50 (5.6 µM) and IC90 (8.6 µM) concentrations observed in our cell based assays.
Therefore, Oxy210 and its analogues, such as Oxy232, could potentially serve as drug candidates
targeting COVID-19.
We have previously characterized Oxy210 as a Hh and TGFb signaling inhibitor [16] and have
demonstrated protective effects of Oxy210 in a mouse model of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
(IPF) (Parhami et al., unpublished observations).

Oxy232, a close structural analogue of Oxy210,

but devoid of significant TGFb pathway inhibitory properties, displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2
activity comparable to Oxy210, suggesting that the mechanisms of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity
shared by Oxy210 and Oxy232 are likely unrelated to TGFb inhibitory properties exhibited by
Oxy210.

This notion was further supported by the lack of antiviral activity displayed by a TGFb

pathway inhibitor, SB431542 (10 µM).

Also, the antiviral activity is not likely to be due to the

inhibition of Hh pathway, as suggested by the lack of antiviral activity of Hh pathway inhibitors,
HPI-1 (10 µM) and GDC0449 (10 µM).

Given the absence of unrelated biological activities, such

as TGFb inhibition, Oxy232 may be a preferable drug candidate compared to Oxy210.
A recent publication reported significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of 27-OHC; low
concentrations of 27-OHC inhibited post-entry and higher concentration inhibited viral entry
process [21].

Our time-of-addition analysis suggests that Oxy210 predominantly inhibits the

post-entry process, which includes viral RNA replication in the replication factory and the
following assembly of progeny virus and its secretion.

We observed the formation of DMVs in

SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, as previously reported [18, 28].

DMVs, membrane compartments

separated from the nuclease/protease-rich cytosol, are generally considered to be sites for efficient
replication of genomic RNA of coronaviruses and of certain other RNA viruses, such as HCV
[26].

DMVs are also very likely to be important in SARS-CoV-2 replication [17].

We showed

that the production of DMVs, induced by SARS-CoV-2, was substantially reduced with Oxy210

treatment.

Antiviral effects of Oxy210 were also observed during the replication of HCV, a virus

that depends on DMVs for replication, but not with HDV, a virus that replicates independently
of DMVs.

These findings suggest that Oxy210 specifically reduces DMV-dependent virus

replication.

It is not clear, however, whether Oxy210 directly inhibits the formation of DMVs.

Further studies will be performed in the future to analyze the mode of action for the antiviral
activity of Oxy210 and its analogues, and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying their
inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 replication and DMV formation.
It is noteworthy to outline the potential advantages of semi-synthetic oxysterols as anti-SARSCoV-2 agents, compared to established antiviral compounds, such as RDV:
1) RDV has to be administered intravenously, most often in a hospital setting, whereas the
oxysterols could potentially be dosed orally (via a pill or liquid gel).

A safe and reliable oral

medication could be administered at an earlier stage, at the time of confirming SARS-CoV-2
infection, and potentially benefit asymptomatic individuals and those at high risk of infection
who have the close-contact with infected individuals and medical care workers as a
prophylactic treatment.
2) Oxysterols reprogram the host cell, interfering with the ability of the virus to use its machinery
to replicate, reducing the likelihood of emerging drug resistance and likely possess universal
antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 mutant strains.
3) The scale up and manufacturing of oxysterol-based drug candidates is expected to be
straightforward and process friendly, especially when compared to the manufacturing
process of RDV, which is rather difficult to prepare on scale.
We conclude that semi-synthetic oxysterol derivatives, such as Oxy210 and Oxy232, could be
promising leads in the search for COVID-19 drug candidates, used alone, or in combination with
other therapies currently FDA approved or under investigation, such as RDV, convalescent
plasma or antibody treatments.

Cell culture.

VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells, VeroE6 cells overexpressing transmembrane protease,

serine 2 (TMPRSS2) [20, 29], were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM;
Wako) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Cell Culture Bioscience), 10 units/mL
penicillin, 10 µg/mL streptomycin, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), and 1 mg/mL G418 (Nacalai) at 37˚C
in 5% CO2.

During the infection assay, 10% FBS was replaced with 2% FBS and G418 removed.

LucNeo#2 cells, carrying HCV subgenomic replicon, were kindly provided by Dr. Kunitada
Shimotohno at National Center for Global Health and Medicine [30] and were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 units/mL penicillin, 10 µg/mL streptomycin, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), and 0.5
mg/mL G418 at 37˚C in 5% CO2.

HepG2-hNTCP-C4 cells, a HepG2 cell clone overexpressing

the HDV entry receptor, sodium taurocholate cotrasporting polypeptide (NTCP), and highly
susceptible to HDV infection [6] were cultured in GlutaMax (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10

hydrocortisone, and 5 µg/ml insulin at 37˚C in 5% CO2.
SARS-CoV-2 infection assay.

SARS-CoV-2 was handled in a biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facility.

We used the SARS-CoV-2 Wk-521 strain, a clinical isolate from a COVID-19 patient, and obtained
viral stocks by infecting VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells [20].

VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells were inoculated

with SARS-CoV-2 at an MOI of 0.001 (Figure 1B, 1C, 2A, and 2B), 0.003 (Figure 1D, 2C, and 3A),
and 1 (Figure 3B) for 1 h and unbound virus removed by washing.

Cells were cultured for 24 h

prior to measuring extracellular viral RNA or detecting viral encoded N protein, for 48 h to detect
cytopathic effects (CPE), and for 7 h to observe cells by electron microscopy.

Compounds were

added during virus inoculation (1 h) and after washing (24 or 48 h) except for time of addition
assay shown in Figure 3A.
For the time of addition assay, we added compounds with three different timings (Figure 3A):
(a) present during the 1 h virus inoculation and maintained throughout the 23 h infection period
(whole life cycle); (b) present during the 1 h virus inoculation and for an additional 2 h and then
removed (entry); or (c) added at 2 h after virus inoculation and present for the remaining 21 h
until harvest (post-entry).

Inhibitors of viral replication such as remdesivir (RDV) are expected

to show antiviral activity in (a) and (c), but not (b), while entry inhibitors including CLQ reduce
viral RNA in all three conditions [2].
Quantification of viral RNA.

Viral RNA in the culture supernatant was extracted with a

QIAamp Viral RNA mini (QIAGEN) or MagMax Viral/Pathogen II Nucleic Acid Isolation kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and quantified by real time RT-PCR analysis with a one-step qRT-PCR

Detection of viral N protein.

Viral N protein was detected using a rabbit anti-SARS-CoV N

antibody [32] as a primary antibody with AlexaFluor 568 anti-rabbit IgG or anti-rabbit IgG-HRP
(Thermo Fisher) as secondary antibodies together with DAPI to stain the nucleus by indirect
immunofluorescence as described previously [33].
Quantification of cell viability.

Cell viability was determined by MTT assay as previously

reported [33].
Quantification of transforming growth factor (TGF)-b and Hedgeog (Hh) activity.

TGFb

activity was examined with NIH3T3 cells precultured with DMEM containing 0.1% bovine calf
serum (BCS) overnight.

NIH3T3 cells were pretreated with the compounds for 2 h and then

stimulated with TGFb1 (20 ng/mL) in the presence or absence of compounds.

After 48 h, RNA

was extracted from the cells and analyzed for quantifying the mRNA for a TGFb target gene,
connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and Oaz1 for normalization.

For examination of Hh

activity, NIH3T3 cells pretreated with the compounds for 2 h were treated with conditioned
medium from CAPAN-1 human pancreatic tumor cells that contain Shh in the absence or
presence of the compounds.

Cellular RNA was extracted and analyzed for the expression of a

Hh target gene, Gli1, and normalized to Oaz1 expression.
Electron microscopic analysis.

Cell were fixed with the buffer [2.5% glutaraldehyde, 2%

paraformaldehyde, and 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)] for 1 h at room temperature followed
by with 1% osmium tetroxide, stained in 1% uranyl acetate, dehydrated through a graded series
of alcohols and embedded in Epon.

Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead

citrate to observe with a transmission electron microscope (HT7700; Hitachi, Ltd., Japan)
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication assay.

HCV replication activity was measured using

LucNeo#2 cells, carrying a subgenomic replicon RNA for an HCV NN strain (genotype-1b) and
the luciferase gene driven by the HCV replication [30].

LucNeo#2 cells were treated with the

compounds indicated in Figure 3C for 48 h and the luciferase activity was measured with
Luciferase Assay System kit (Promega).

Sofosbuvir, a clinically used HCV polymerase

inhibitor, was used as a positive control.
Hepatitis D virus (HDV) replication assay.

HDV were recovered from the culture supernatant

of Huh7 cells transfected with the plasmids for HDV genome and for hepatitis B virus surface
antigen [34].

HepG2-hNTCP-C4 cells were inoculated with HDV for 16 h and were further

cultured for 6 days in the presence or absence of Oxy210 to detect intracelular HDV RNA [34].
Myrcludex-B (Myr-B), used as a positive control that inhibits HDV infection, was treated during
the virus inoculation.
