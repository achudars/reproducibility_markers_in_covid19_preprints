Abstract

21

SARS-CoV-2 variants have emerged with enhanced pathogenicity and transmissibility, and

22

escape from pre-existing immunity, suggesting first-generation vaccines and monoclonal

23

antibodies may now be less effective. This manuscript demonstrates an approach for preventing

24

clinical sequelae and the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants. First, we affinity-matured an

25

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) decoy protein, achieving 1000-fold binding

26

improvements that extend across a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 variants and distantly related,

27

ACE2-dependent coronaviruses. Next, we demonstrated the expression of this decoy in proximal

28

airway when delivered via intranasal administration of an AAV vector. This intervention

29

significantly diminished clinical and pathologic consequences of SARS-CoV-2 challenge in a

30

mouse model and achieved therapeutic levels of decoy expression at the surface of proximal

31

airways when delivered intranasally to nonhuman primates. Importantly, this long-lasting,

32

passive protection approach is applicable in vulnerable populations such as the elderly and

33

immune-compromised that do not respond well to traditional vaccination. This approach could

34

be useful in combating COVID-19 surges caused by SARS-CoV-2 variants and should be

considered as a countermeasure to future pandemics caused by pre-emergent members, ACE2-

dependent CoVs that are poised for zoonosis.

Introduction

65

Developing a soluble form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)—referred to as a

66

decoy—is considered a protein therapeutic in the treatment of COVID-19 patients (1, 2). We

67

isolated an ACE2 decoy that broadly neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 variants and demonstrate its

68

potential for preventing COVID-19 when expressed from an adeno-associated virus (AAV)

69

following intranasal (IN) delivery. We have reported previously on the effectiveness of IN AAV

70

to express antibodies that broadly neutralize pandemic strains of influenza (3-6).

71

Results

72

ACE2 decoy affinity maturation enhances neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 100-fold

73

We initially constructed a decoy receptor by fusing a human ACE2 fragment to the human IgG4

74

Fc domain. We cloned this first-generation decoy into AAV and delivered it as a nasal spray into

75

nonhuman primates (NHPs). Although we detected decoy expression in nasal lavage fluid

76

(NLF), the decoy was not produced at levels sufficient to overcome the low neutralizing potency

77

of this protein (Figure S1). We therefore set out to affinity-mature the ACE2 protein sequence.

78
79

We generated diverse (>108 transformants) ACE2 variant libraries in a yeast-display format(7)

80

using error-prone polymerase chain reaction (PCR; Figure 1A and Figure S2). We screened the

81

primary libraries in rounds of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS; Figure 1B). We

82

selected populations with better binding to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and

83

tracked library convergence with deep sequencing (Figure 1C and 1D). Frequently observed

84

mutations from our primary library sorts overlap partially with mutations reported by others(2,

85

8), including substitutions at T27 and N90 glycan disruption (Figure S2). Validated clones from

86

the sorted primary libraries (Figure S3) seeded a secondary library formed by mutagenic

87

recombination(9, 10), which we screened using stringent off-rate sorting(11) (Figure 1C).

88
89

We expressed ACE2 variants from several stages of the yeast-display screening as soluble IgG4

90

Fc fusions, evaluated expression titers, and predicted IC50 for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization using

91

reporter virus (Figure S3). The most potent neutralizing variants converged upon similar

92

substitutions at five positions: 31, 35, 79, 330, and N90 glycan disruption (Figure 1E). After

93

further characterization, we selected CDY14-Fc4 as the most improved ACE2 decoy variant. To

94

avoid off-target effects in vivo, we ablated ACE2 enzyme activity by introducing H345L(12) at

95

no cost to potency. By surface plasmon resonance (SPR) the active site-null CDY14HL-Fc4

96

bound SARS-CoV-2 RBD with 1,000-fold improved affinity (29 nM for wtACE2 vs. 31 pM for

97

CDY14HL-Fc4; see Figure 1, panels F and G). CDY14HL-Fc4 neutralized Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-

98

CoV-2 reporter nearly 100-fold better than the un-engineered ACE2 decoy (IC50 127 ng/ml for

99

CDY14HL-Fc4 vs. 11 µg/ml for ACE2-wt-Fc4; see Figure 1H).

100
101

ACE2 decoy is effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants and SARS-CoV-1

102

Escape mutations at the immunodominant ACE2 binding site of the RBD is of major concern for

103

emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants(13). RBDs from more distant ACE2-dependent CoVs also

104

differ substantially from the original SARS-CoV-2 at the ACE2 interface (Figure 2A). Unlike

105

antibodies, decoy inhibitors may achieve broad neutralization and escape mutant resistance;

106

changes that reduce decoy binding would also decrease ACE2 receptor binding, thus reducing

107

viral fitness. To assess this potential, we measured ACE2-Fc4 (a surrogate for the native

108

receptor) and CDY14HL-Fc4 (the therapeutic decoy) affinities across a diverse panel of CoV

109

RBDs using SPR. We chose RBDs from strains under positive selection in the course of the 2020

110

pandemic (e.g., 439K (14), B.1.1.7 and B1.351, first isolated in the EU, UK, and the Republic of

111

South Africa, respectively(15)), and mink-adapted isolates(16). Several emerging SARS-CoV-2

112

variants with improved affinity for ACE2-Fc4 (B1.1.7, 453F, and 501T) also bind CDY14HL-

113

Fc4 more tightly (Figure 2B and Figure S4), while B.1.351, 439K, and 439K/417V only

114

modestly alter binding to ACE2-Fc4 or CDY14HL-Fc4. While 486L reduces affinity for

115

CDY14HL-Fc4, it does so for ACE2-Fc4 proportionally. Remarkably, decoy and receptor RBD

116

affinities are tightly coupled even for the distantly related SARS-pandemic CoV-1 and the pre-

117

emergent bat WIV1-CoV(17).

118
119

Next, we compared decoy neutralization across diverse SARS-CoVs using pseudotyped

120

lentivirus reporters. The SARS-CoV-2 variant reporter viruses in the 614G (18, 19) background

121

(439K, B1.1.7, B.1.351) are neutralized near or below the IC50 of the 614G reporter (IC50 values:

122

77 ng/ml for 614G, 42 ng/ml for 439K, 93 ng/ml for B.1.1.7, and 45 for B.1.351; Figure 2C).

123

Remarkably, selecting for increased binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD resulted in very potent

124

neutralization of the phylogenetically distinct SARS-CoV-1 reporter virus (IC50 = 53 ng/ml).

125

Taken together with the binding survey, these data indicate that structural features of the ACE2

126

interface have been retained through the stages of directed evolution. Moreover, the data predict

127

that CDY14HL-Fc4 could protect against current, emerging, and future pandemic ACE2-

128

dependent CoVs.

130

ACE2 decoy diminishes SARS-CoV-2 sequelae in transgenic mice

131

We considered SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies in hamsters, macaques, and the hACE2

132

transgenic (TG) mice to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of an AAV vector expressing CDY14HL-

133

Fc4. In all models, achieving evidence of viral replication in vivo requires virus doses that far

134

exceed those required for human transmission. Furthermore, the clinical and pathologic sequalae

135

of SARS-CoV-2 exposure is attenuated in these species compared to severely affected humans.

136

The most significant limitation, however, is that all the challenge models require direct pathogen

137

delivery to the lung in order to demonstrate pathology, which does not simulate the mechanism

138

of the AAV decoy product, which focuses on localized expression in the proximal airway

139

following intranasal delivery to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection and its consequences. We

140

therefore selected the hACE2 TG mouse model for three reasons: 1) we can characterize disease

141

by measuring viral loads, clinical sequalae, and histopathology; 2) we can use an IN route of

142

administration as we would in humans, realizing this deposits vector in the proximal and distal

143

airways of the mouse, while IN delivery in humans is restricted to the proximal airway; and 3)

144

we can leverage the extensive experience of murine models in de-risking human studies of AAV

145

gene transfer.

146
147

We conducted pilot studies in wild-type mice to determine which decoy protein (CDY14-Fc4 vs.

148

CDY14HL-Fc4) and capsid (clade F AAVhu68 vs. clade A AAVrh91) maximized expression

149

following in vivo gene delivery. We administered 1011 GC of vector and recovered broncho-

150

alveolar lavage samples (BAL) 7 days later to evaluate ACE2 decoy protein expression and

151

activity (Figure 3A-C). Based on mass spectrometry (MS) protein measurements, the AAVhu68

152

capsid was more efficient than the AAVrh91 capsid in transducing mouse lung. The HL

153

mutation modestly reduced expression (p<0.007). Importantly, we found a direct correlation

154

between decoy expression levels and the ability to bind to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and

155

neutralize a SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype, demonstrating function of the decoy expressed from

156

airway tissues (Figure 3A-C). We selected CDY14HL-Fc4 as the clinical candidate transgene

157

and the AAVhu68 capsid for the mouse challenge studies (Figure 3D).

158
159

We IN delivered AAVhu68-CDY14HL-Fc4 or vehicle to hACE2-TG mice. Seven days later,

160

animals were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 (280 pfu), followed clinically (observation and daily

161

weights), and necropsied on days 4 and 7 after challenge for tissue and BAL analysis (Figure

162

3D). Expression of CDY14HL-Fc4 in BAL normalized for dilution was in the range of the IC50

163

measured in vitro and in the pilot studies (Figure 3F). Sham-treated SARS-CoV-2 challenged

164

animals demonstrated statistically significant weight loss as has been described by others(20-22).

165

We observed significantly less weight loss amongst vector-treated animals (which we followed

166

for 7 days) compared to untreated animals (observed on days 4 and 7; p<0.05, linear mixed effect

167

modeling). The vector-treated animals also significantly differed from the untreated,

168

unchallenged animals (Figure 3E). Interestingly, the clinical outcome of the treatment was better

169

among females than males, although we noted significant variations within the treated group

170

(Figure S5).

171
172

Histopathology of the lungs from vehicle treated animals challenged with SARS-CoV-2 revealed

173

findings similar to that previously described in this model(22). As expected, tissues from animals

174

not challenged with SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated no histopathology. Samples from days 4 and 7

175

showed reduced lung pathology in AAVhu68.CDY14HL-Fc4 treated animals vs. the vehicle-

176

treated animals; the day-4 samples achieved statistical significance (p<0.05; Wilcoxon Rank

177

Sum Test). (Figure 3G). Compared to vehicle-treated animals, viral RNA in BAL and lung

178

homogenate was diminished at day 4 and 7 in AAVhu68.CDY14HL-Fc4 treated animals (Figure

179

3H and 3I). The greatest reductions were at day 7 for both BAL (26-fold) and lung tissue (35-

180

fold). Impact of the AAVhu68.CDY14HL-Fc4 on SARS-CoV-2 replication, as determined by

181

median sgRNA levels, was greatest at day 7 (27-fold reduction, Figure 3J). Although there was

182

substantial inter-animal variation, 2/5 animals in the treated groups showed nearly complete

183

abrogation of viral replication and little weight loss by day 7.

184
185

AAV delivery yields therapeutic ACE2 decoy levels in nonhuman primates

186

Next, we determined which AAV capsid is most efficient at transducing cells of the nonhuman

187

primate (NHP) proximal airways—the desired cellular targets for COVID-19 prophylaxis

188

following nasal delivery of vector. We administered vector using a previously approved

189

intranasal mucosal atomization device (MAD Nasal™), which comprises an atomizing tip with a

190

soft conical nostril seal fit on a standard syringe (Figure 4A). A mixture of 9 AAV serotypes

191

with uniquely barcoded transgenes were administered via the MAD Nasal™ to an NHP. Tissues

192

were harvested 14 days later for evaluation of relative transgene expression using the mRNA

193

bar-coding technique (Figure 4B)(23). The novel Clade A capsid (AAVrh91) we isolated from

194

macaque liver performed best in the nasopharynx and septum (Figure 4C and 4D) with low but

195

detectable expression levels in large airways and distal lung (Figure S6A-G). Clade E and F

196

capsids performed better than AAVrh91 in some non-target tissues such as distal lung (Figure
9

197

S6A-G). The profile of expression from AAVrh91 illustrates relative distribution of transgene

198

expression with proximal airway structures>intra-pulmonary conducting airway>distal lung

199

(Figure 4E).

200
201

To determine the candidate for clinical evaluation, we conducted a final NHP study where

202

groups of 2 animals were administered 5x1012 GC of vectors that differed with respect to capsid

203

(AAVhu68 vs. AAVrh91) and transgene cassettes (CDY14-Fc4 vs CDY14HL-Fc4). NLFs were

204

harvested on days 7, 14, and 28, and animals were necropsied on day 28 for biodistribution.

205

Analysis of pulmonary tissues from day 28 revealed broad distribution throughout the proximal

206

and distal airway, with AAVrh91 demonstrating superior gene transfer to proximal airway

207

structures, as suggested by the barcode study (Figure S6H-I). We estimated decoy protein

208

concentrations in the air-surface liquid (ASF) based on dilution-adjusted MS measurements of

209

NLF (Figure 4F). The effective concentrations at the ASF were in the range that demonstrated

210

neutralization in the in vitro assay. Expression was slightly higher with AAVrh91 vs. AAVhu68,

211

and CDY14HL-Fc4 vs. CDY14-Fc4. A subset of samples evaluated for binding to the spike

212

protein of SARS-CoV-2 showed a good correlation with decoy protein as measured by MS. This

213

indicates that the decoy protein produced in vivo in proximal airways is indeed functional (Figure

214

4G).

215
216

Based on these data, we selected a candidate for subsequent clinical evaluation called GTP404.

217

This candidate utilizes AAVrh91 as the capsid because of its transduction profile and

218

CDY14HL-Fc4 as the transgene because it retained broad and potent neutralizing activity in the

219

setting of an ACE2-disabling mutation. In preparation for IND-enabling studies, we administered

220

GTP404 at a 10-fold lower dose to two additional NHPs (Figure 4F). Impressive levels of decoy

221

protein were present in nasal ASF with concentrations only slightly reduced in comparison to

222

those achieved with the higher dose.

224

Discussion

225

The rapid emergence of more dangerous and transmissible variants of SARS-CoV-2 in this

226

pandemic is troubling, but not unexpected. The immunological pressures on the virus during

227

natural infections, following antibody therapies, and active vaccines have promoted the

228

emergence of variants(24). It appears that SARS-CoV-2 improved fitness through mutations that

229

both increased affinity for ACE2 and decreased neutralization by antibodies elicited to precursor

230

strains of the virus(15, 25, 26). The density of ACE2 in the nose and airway has been linked to

231

pathogenicity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2(27). The lower levels of ACE2 in the

232

proximal airways of children may be responsible for the lower infection rates and milder

233

symptoms in this group(28). It has been proposed that SARS-CoV-2 variants achieve greater

234

infection and transmission through increased affinity(25, 29); here we confirm increased affinity

235

for ACE2 in SARS-CoV-2 strains under positive selection during 2020.

236
237

Our original goal in engineering the ACE2 decoy was to improve its potency against SARS-

238

CoV-2, which we accomplished through affinity maturation against the Wuhan-Hu-1spike

239

protein in a yeast display system. Our selection strategy yielded a decoy with high binding and

240

neutralizing activity against a full range of SARS-CoV-2 variants, including B1.1.7 and B1.351,

241

which emerged from the UK and Republic of South Africa, respectively. However, we were

242

surprised to see equally potent binding and neutralization against other betacoronaviruses,

243

including SARS-CoV-1, which was responsible for the 2003 SARS pandemic. The presence of

244

several second-shell mutations in the affinity-matured decoy may contribute to this breadth since

245

the majority of the ACE2 contact surface was preserved (Figure S3). The engineered decoy may

246

be the Achilles’ heel of any ACE2-dependent CoV whose primary driver of fitness – higher

247

binding to its receptor – should further enhance the potency of the ACE2 decoy.

248
249

We focused on IN delivery of AAV to express CDY14HL-Fc4 to prevent COVID-19. We used

250

the previously described hACE2-TG mouse challenge model to demonstrate efficacy of the

251

decoy in vivo. Treated animals lost less weight, showed reduced lung pathology, and showed less

252

replication of the challenge virus. Our results are consistent with the use of this model to

253

evaluate convalescent plasma(21), protease inhibitors(30), and monoclonal antibodies(31), where

254

weight loss, pulmonary pathology, and viral load were decreased, but not completely

255

abrogated.(21) We believe that the mouse challenge model underestimates the potential efficacy

256

of IN AAV-CDY14HL-Fc4. The dose of SARS-CoV-2 that results in human infection is likely

257

much lower, and therefore, easier to neutralize than the inoculating dose used in the mouse

258

challenge model (2.5x106 particles or 280 PFU). We used a novel AAV Clade A capsid called

259

AAVrh91 to maximize transduction in the proximal airways of NHPs. At a relatively low dose

260

(5x1011 GC), we achieved levels of CDY14HL-Fc4 in the ASF that should be sufficient to

261

neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants. Based on our previous studies—using AAV to deliver broadly

262

neutralizing antibodies against influenza—we believe expression should be durable for at least

263

six months and can be effectively readministered(3-6),(32).

265

The emergence of three lethal and highly contagious CoV outbreaks in two decades – SARS in

266

2003, MERS in 2012, and COVID-19 in 2019 – suggests that CoVs will remain a threat to global

267

health. Surveillance of potential zoonotic sources of these CoVs, such as bats, revealed reservoirs

268

of related viruses capable of evolution and cross-species transmission(33). One possible

269

therapeutic application of CDY14HL-Fc4 is in the prevention and treatment of future outbreaks

270

caused by new CoVs that utilize ACE2 as a receptor. GTP404 could be rapidly deployed from

271

stockpiles to contain the initial outbreak and the CDY14HL-Fc4 protein can be leveraged to

272

improve outcomes in those who are infected. The CDY14HL-Fc4 products may be useful in the

273

current COVID-19 pandemic if SARS-CoV-2 variants confound current treatment and

274

prevention strategies. An immediate application could be in immune-suppressed individuals who

275

do not respond to traditional vaccines, develop chronic infection with SARS-CoV-2, and may be

276

reservoirs for new variants(24). The advantage of vector-expressed decoy in preventing COVID-

277

19 infections in immune-suppressed individuals is that this therapy does not rely on the

278

recipient’s adaptive immune system to be effective.

Materials and Methods

286

Yeast display

287

We generated mutagenized ACE2 gene fragments by error prone PCR using the Diversify PCR

288

Random Mutagenesis Kit (TakaraBio) at multiple mutation levels, mixing the PCR products.

289

We used Gap-repair cloning and high-efficiency LiAc transformation(34) to assemble the ACE2

290

gene fragments into a centromeric plasmid. The plasmid contained an upstream Aga2 gene

291

fragment, a downstream HA epitope tag with flexible GSG linkers, and was driven by an

292

inducible GAL1 promoter, and contained a low-copy centromeric origin, similar to

293

pTCON2(35). Following transformation or sorting rounds, we passaged the libraries at 10X

294

diversity 3 times in SD-trp before inducing in log phase for 24 hrs at 30°C in SG-CAA(35). For

295

FACS, we stained the yeast with recombinant CoV2 RBD-His6 (Genscript) at diminishing

296

concentrations through the rounds (5nM, 1nM, 0.1nM +/- extended washes of up to 17 hrs for

297

off-rate sorting). We followed up with Mouse anti His6 (Genscript), rabbit anti-HA-PE (Cell

298

Signaling Technology), and goat anti mouse-488 secondary antibody (ThermoFisher) all in

299

phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% BSA. Libraries were sorted and analyzed for RBD

300

binding and ACE2 expression at the Penn Flow Core on BD Influx and BD FACSAria II

301

instruments. We extracted plasmid from clones or pools of clones using the Yeast Plasmid

302

MiniPrep Kit (Zymo) and transformed this into bacteria for amplification.

303
304

Next-Generation Sequencing and Analysis

305

We performed 2x250 paired-end Illumina sequencing on randomly sheared and size-selected

306

ACE2 amplicons from the yeast display rounds. After removing adapters and low-quality reads,

307

we mapped clean reads no shorter than 200bp to the WT ACE2 nucleotide sequences using

308

NovoAlign (v.4.03.01). We translated in-frame sequences with mapping quality scores no lower

309

than 30 and without indels into amino acid sequences and compared to the WT ACE2 protein

310

sequence. We tallied non-synonymous changes for each codon across the ACE2 sequence (18-

311

615). We calculated mutation rates at each codon as follows: (sum of non-synonymous

312

AAs)/(sum of all AAs).

313
314

Expression of ACE2 variant IgG Fc4 fusions and RBDs

315

We sub-cloned candidate ACE2 synthetic DNA or decoy sequences from the yeast display

316

format into pCDNA3.1, using the endogenous ACE2 signal peptide and appending a human

317

IgG4 Fc domain (residues 99 to 327 from Uniprot reference sequence P01861) and a C-terminal

318

His6 tag. To generate protein for screening we transiently transfected HEK293 cells with

319

plasmid DNA in six-well plates using PEI and collected and clarified supernatant 72 hours later.

320

We quantified expression using the IgG4 Human ELISA kit (Invitrogen BMS2095) with IgG4

321

standards provided in the kit. For CDY14-Fc4 and CDY14HL-Fc4, we produced the protein in a

322

similar manner but purified it on protein A sepharose followed by dialysis and SDS-Page

323

analysis. We determined the concentration using the predicted extinction coefficient at 280nm.

324

We cloned the synthetic sequences (IDT gBlocks) of RBD [Spike amino acids 330-530 (CoV2),

325

317-516 (CoV1), and 318-517 (WIV1-CoV)] into pCDNA3.1 between an IL2 signal peptide plus

326

Gly-Ser and a C-terminal His6 tag. We transfected RBD plasmids into HEK293 cells using PEI

327

and collected supernatants 72 hrs later for clarification, concentration, and purification on Ni-

328

NTA resin, followed by dialysis into PBS. We confirmed purity using Coomassie-stained SDS-

329

PAGE analysis. We determined concentrations of the RBD using predicted extinction

330

coefficient at 280nm.

331
332

RBD Binding with SPR

333

We performed SPR binding analysis using a Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare) at room

334

temperature in HBS-EP(+) buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, and

335

0.05% P20 surfactant, Cat# BR100669, Cytiva) using a protein A/G derivatized sensor chip

336

(Cat# SCBS PAGHC30M, XanTec Bioanalytics). We injected WT ACE2-hFc4 or CDY14-hFc4

337

diluted to 60nM in HBS-EP(+) at a flow rate of 10 µL/min for 3 min to capture ~1,000 response

338

units (RU) on the sensor surface in each cycle. We measured binding of various SARS-CoV

339

RBD proteins to this surface at concentrations ranging from 200 nM to 0.195 nM. RBD binding

340

was measured at a flow rate of 30 µL/min, with a 3 min association time and a 15 min

341

dissociation time. We performed regeneration between binding cycles using 10 mM glycine pH

342

1.5 injected at a flow rate of 60 µL/min for 1 min. KD values were determined for each

343

interaction using kinetics parameter fitting in the Biacore T200 Evaluation software. We used a

344

global 1:1 binding model and did not adjust for refractive index shift. Data presented are the

345

averate of two or more replicates were measured for each RBD domain tested.

346
347

CoV Pseudotyped Lentiviral Neutralization Assay

348

We obtained non-replicating lentivirus pseudotyped with CoV spike proteins from Integral

349

Molecular. The reporter virus particles encoded a renilla luciferase reporter gene. We set up

350

neutralization reactions with 100 ul of inhibitor diluted in full serum media and 10 ul of reporter

351

virus. After 1 hour at 37°C, we added 20,000 cells/well in 50 ul of a HEK 293T cell line

352

overexpressing ACE2 (Integral Molecular) and incubated the cells for 48 hours. We measured

353

reporter virus transduction activity on a luminometer (BioTek) using the Renilla Glo Kit

354

(Promega) following manufacturer’s instructions. For higher throughput screens of neutralizing

355

potency, we used crude expression supernatant (described above) in the neutralization assay at 1

356

or 2 dilutions (typically 10- or 100-fold). We transformed the luciferase reading to an estimated

357

potency (EP) using the following formula: EP = (L*[decoy])/(1-L), where L is the fractional

358

luciferase level as compared to a mock sample (no inhibitor), and [decoy] is the concentration of

359

the decoy in the neutralization well. This was sufficient to rank clones without performing a full

360

titration.

362

AAV Vector Production

363

The University of Pennsylvania Vector Core produced recombinant AAV vectors as previously

364

described (36, 37).

365
366

Decoy Quantification by Mass Spectrometry

367

Standards

368

Soluble hACE2Fc (produced in-house) was spiked at different levels (0.5-500 ng/mL) into PBS

369

or NLF acquired from a naïve rhesus macaque. Samples were denatured and reduced at 90oC for

370

10 minutes in the presence of 10mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 2M Guanadinium-HCl (Gnd-HCl).

371

We cooled the samples to room temperature, then alkylated samples with 30mM iodoacetamide

17

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.09.439149; this version posted April 12, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

372

(IAM) at room temperature for 30 minutes in the dark. The alkylation reaction was quenched by

373

adding 1µL DTT. We added 20mM ammonium bicarbonate to the denatured protein solution,

374

pH 7.5-8 at a volume to dilute the final Gnd-HCl concentration to 200mM. Trypsin solution was

375

added at ~4ng of trypsin per sample ratio and incubated at 37°C overnight. After digestion,

376

formic acid was added to a final of 0.5% to quench digestion reaction.

377

LC–MS/MS

378

We performed online chromatography with an Acclaim PepMap column (15 cm long, 300-μm

379

inner diameter) and a Thermo UltiMate 3000 RSLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled

380

to a Q Exactive HF with a NanoFlex source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). During online analysis,

381

the column temperature was regulated to a temperature of 35°C. Peptides were separated with a

382

gradient of mobile phase A (MilliQ water with 0.1% formic acid) and mobile phase B

383

(acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid). We ran the gradient from 4% B to 6% B over 15 min, then

384

to 10% B for 25 min (40 minutes total), then to 30% B for 46 min (86 minutes total). Samples

385

were loaded directly to the column. The column size was 75 cm x 15 um I.D. and was packed

386

with 2 micron C18 media (Acclaim PepMap). Due to the loading, lead-in, and washing steps, the

387

total time for an LC-MS/MS run was about 2 hours.

388
389

We acquired MS data using a data-dependent top-20 method for the Q Exactive HF; we

390

dynamically chose the most abundant not-yet-sequenced precursor ions from the survey scans

391

(200–2000 m/z). Sequencing was performed via higher energy collisional dissociation

392

fragmentation with a target value of 1e5 ions, determined with predictive automatic gain control.

393

We performed an isolation of precursors with a window of 4 m/z. Survey scans were acquired at

394

a resolution of 120,000 at m/z 200. Resolution for HCD spectra was set to 30,000 at m/z200 with

395

a maximum ion injection time of 50 ms and a normalized collision energy of 30. We set the S-

396

lens RF level at 50, which gave optimal transmission of the m/z region occupied by the peptides

397

from our digest. We excluded precursor ions with single, unassigned, or six and higher charge

398

states from fragmentation selection.

399

Data processing

400

We used BioPharma Finder 1.0 software (Thermo Fischer Scientific) to analyze all data. For

401

peptide mapping, we used a single-entry protein FASTA database to perform searches. The mass

402

area of the target peptide was plotted against the spike concentration to complete a standard

403

curve.

404

Selection of target peptide

405

Based on initial in silico studies, we selected four peptides as possible sequence-specific matches

406

for targeted quantification. We evaluated sensitivity performance for quantification of the four

407

peptide targets in the NLF background matrix. Following blank injections to establish system

408

cleanliness, replicate injections (n = 3) were made at all levels, from 0.5 ng/mL to 500 ng/mL.

409

Three of the peptides were detected with ANHYEDYGDYWR providing the greatest response

410

across the whole range. We determined retention time (RT) reproducibility across all samples (n

411

= 24) and determined peak area reproducibility and quantification accuracy for each level.

412

Excellent linearity was observed for the levels tested with typical R2 > 0.94 for

413

ANHYEDYGDYWR. For ANHYEDYGDYWR, we observed excellent precision and accuracy

414

at all levels, with all replicates within 10% CV. For test articles, 1x or 10x NLF and/or

415

bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) is treated as previously described without any dilution or

416

protein precipitation. The mass area of target peptide in test articles was compared to the linear

417

calibration generated for the spiked material to determine the level of decoy present in the test

418

article.

419
420

ASF dilutions from serum and lavage urea

421

We used the urea concentrations in BAL or NLF and in serum collected at the same time to

422

determine the dilution that the lavage introduced to the ASF(38). We quantified urea in mouse

423

BAL and serum, and in NHP NLF using the Urea Assay Kit (Abcam). We obtained serum urea

424

concentrations from NHP from the blood urea nitrogen as part of standard bloodwork lab panels

425

(Antech).

426
427

Spike Binding ELISA

428

SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein RBD (Sinobio #40592-V08H) was immobilized on a 96-well plate

429

(0.25ug/mL in PBS, 100ul/well) at 4oC overnight. Plates were then washed 5x with PBS/0.05%

430

Tween and blocked with PBS/1.0% BSA for 1 hour with shaking. Samples (2x dilution in

431

PBS/2.0% BSA) and standards (soluble hACE2-Fc at starting concentration 100ng/ml, 12-point,

432

1:2 serial dilution, plus a 0.0ng/ml blank, in PBS/1.0% BSA) were added at 100ul/well in

433

duplicate and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with shaking. Wells were washed as

434

described and biotin conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Jackson AffiniPure #109-065-098;

435

1:30,000 or Southern Biotech 2049-08; 1:1,000) in PBS/1.0% BSA detection antibody was

436

added to the wells at 100ul/well and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature with shaking.

437

Wells were washed as described, followed by the addition of 100ul/well Streptavidin-HRP

438

(Abcam #ab7403; 1:30,000) in PBS/1.0% BSA for 30 minutes with shaking. Wells were washed

439

as described and incubated in 100ul/well TMB substrate (Seracare #5120-0076) in the dark at

440

room temperature with shaking until reaction was stopped with 100ul/well TMB Stop Solution

441

(Seracare #5150-0021). Absorbances were read at 450 nm using a Spectramax M3 plate reader.

442

We exported and analyzed the data in GraphPad Prism Version 9.0.2. All raw data was blank

443

subtracted. We plotted a standard curve of soluble hACE2-Fc, and the X-axis (concentration)

444

was log10 transformed. We performed a 4-parameter nonlinear regression upon the transformed

445

standard curve, and interpolated sample concentrations.

446
447

Determination of Matrix Interference in BAL and NLF Samples

448

Soluble hACE2Fc was spiked into NLF (0.0, 0.5, 2.0, and 10.0 ng/ml) acquired from a naïve

449

rhesus macaque on the same plate with a standard curve (soluble hACE2Fc starting

450

concentration 100ng/ml, 12-point, 1:2 serial dilution, plus a 0.0ng/ml blank) in PBS/1.0% BSA.

451

We performed the spike binding assay and data analysis as described above.

Expression study in mice

454

All animal procedures were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the

455

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Pennsylvania. C57BL/6J mice

456

were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. Anesthetized mice received an IN administration

457

of 1011 GC of AAVhu68.CDY14-Fc4, AAVrh91.CDY14-Fc4, AAVhu68.CDY14HL-Fc4, or

458

462

hACE2 TG Mouse Study

463

To evaluate the prophylactic efficacy potential of AAV expressing hACE2 receptor decoys

464

against SARS-CoV-2, BIOQUAL, Inc. (Rockville, MD) conducted a challenge study using

465

hACE2 TG mice (Stock No: 034860, The Jackson Laboratory). Mice were administered with

466

either vehicle or 1011 GC of AAVhu68.CDY14HL-Fc4 IN on day -7 as described above. On day

467

0, mice were administered with mock or the SARS-CoV-2 challenge (50 µl of 2.8x102 pfu of

468

SARS-CoV-2, USA_WA1/2020 isolate [NR-52281, BEI Resources]). Mice were euthanized on

469

either day 4 or 7 via cervical dislocation. BAL was collected as described above and aliquoted

470

for viral load assays into Trizol LS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) or heat inactivated

471

(60°C for 30 minutes) for decoy protein expression. The lung was collected and split for

472

histopathology into 10% neutral buffered formalin or snap frozen for viral load analysis. RNA

473

extraction for RT-qPCR, the quantitative RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and

474

subgenomic RNA were performed as described(39).

475
476

Histopathology of Collected Organs

477

The organs collected at necropsy were trimmed and routinely processed for hematoxylin and

478

eosin (H&E) staining. Slides were blindly evaluated by a blinded pathologist using a severity

479

score of 0 (no lesions observed), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), 4 (marked) and 5 (severe)

480

for each finding.

Intranasal capsid comparison by AAV barcoding

483

We generated a set of custom barcoded plasmids using degenerate nucleotides that anneal

484

immediately downstream of the stop codon in a GFP reporter construct that contains the AAV2

485

ITRs. We produced barcoded AAV vectors for each serotype in the study separately by

486

transfecting HEK293 cells as described(36), replacing the typical single ITR-containing plasmid

487

in the transfection mix with an equimolar mixture of 4 uniquely barcoded reporter constructs.

488

We pooled the individual vector preps on an equimolar basis using their digital droplet PCR

489

titers. We determined the absolute barcode distribution in the AAV pool by deep sequencing; we

490

extracted AAV genomes from the pool and performed linear-range PCR using primers that flank

491

the barcode region to generate an amplicon for paired-end Illumina sequencing.

492
493

NHP studies

494

Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques were obtained from Primgen (PreLabs). NHP studies were

495

conducted at the University of Pennsylvania or Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia within

496

facilities that are United States Department of Agriculture-registered, Association for

497

Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care-accredited, and Public Health Service-

498

assured. For the barcode study, 4x1012 GC of the pool AAV preps was delivered IN in a total

499

volume of 0.28 ml to an adult male rhesus macaque using the MAD Nasal™ device. After 14

500

days, we collected airway tissues at necropsy, and extracted total RNA using Trizol Reagent

501

(Thermo Fisher). We generated cDNAs using Superscript III reverse transcriptase

502

(ThermoFisher) and an oligo dT primer. We used the cDNAs to prepare barcode amplicons for

503

Illumina sequencing as described above. We extracted the relative barcode abundances in input

504

(AAV mixture) and output (tissue cDNAs) from Illumina data. The ratio of output to input

505

relative abundances for each barcode in each tissue is proportional to the relative efficiency of

506

the capsid linked to that barcode in that tissue. Agreement among the 4 barcodes assigned to

507

each capsid allows us to assess assay noise, and detect rare, tissue-specific effects of the barcode

508

itself on transcript stability (none detected). For each tissue, we quantified the total capsid-

509

derived transcript per ug of total RNA using qPCR with a primer/probe set common to all the

510

barcoded reporters.

511
512

For the decoy expression in NHPs, cynomolgus macaques (n=2/vector) were administered IN

513

with 5x1012 GC of AAVhu68.CDY14, AAVrh91.CDY14, AAVhu68.CDY14HL, or

514

AAVrh91.CDY14HL as described above. An additional two NHPs were administered with

515

5x1011 GC of AAVrh91.CDY14HL. All NHPs were negative for pre-existing neutralizing

516

antibody titres to the administered AAV capsid prior to study initiation (Immunology Core at the

517

Gene Therapy Program). Animals were monitored throughout the in-life phase for complete

518

blood counts, clinical chemistries, and coagulation panels by Antech Diagnostics (Lake Success,

519

NY). On days 7, 14, and 28 NLF was collected (animals placed in ventral recumbency with head

520

tilted to the right, up to 5 mL of PBS delivered in 1mL aliquots, and fluid collected via gravity).

521

Animals were necropsied on day 28 and a full histopathological evaluation was performed.
