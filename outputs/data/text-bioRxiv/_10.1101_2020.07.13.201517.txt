ABSTRACT
Human coronaviruses (hCoV) have become a threat to global health and society, as evident from
the SARS outbreak in 2002 caused by SARS-CoV-1 and the most recent COVID-19 pandemic
caused by SARS-CoV-2. Despite high sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-1 and -2, each
strain has distinctive virulence. A better understanding of the basic molecular mechanisms
mediating changes in virulence is needed. Here, we profile the virus-host protein-protein
interactions of two hCoV non-structural proteins (nsps) that are critical for virus replication. We
use tandem mass tag-multiplexed quantitative proteomics to sensitively compare and contrast the
interactomes of nsp2 and nsp4 from three betacoronavirus strains: SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2,
and hCoV-OC43 – an endemic strain associated with the common cold. This approach enables
the identification of both unique and shared host cell protein binding partners and the ability to
further compare the enrichment of common interactions across homologs from related strains.
We identify common nsp2 interactors involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ signaling and
mitochondria biogenesis. We also identifiy nsp4 interactors unique to each strain, such as E3
ubiquitin ligase complexes for SARS-CoV-1 and ER homeostasis factors for SARS-CoV-2.
Common nsp4 interactors include N-linked glycosylation machinery, unfolded protein response
(UPR) associated proteins, and anti-viral innate immune signaling factors. Both nsp2 and nsp4
interactors are strongly enriched in proteins localized at mitochondrial-associated ER membranes
suggesting a new functional role for modulating host processes, such as calcium homeostasis, at
these organelle contact sites. Our results shed light on the role these hCoV proteins play in the
infection cycle, as well as host factors that may mediate the divergent pathogenesis of OC43 from
SARS strains. Our mass spectrometry workflow enables rapid and robust comparisons of multiple
bait proteins, which can be applied to additional viral proteins. Furthermore, the identified common
interactions may present new targets for exploration by host-directed anti-viral therapeutics.

INTRODUCTION
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive single-stranded RNA viruses capable of causing human
disease with a range of severity. While some strains, such as endemic hCoV-OC43, cause milder
common-cold like symptoms, other strains are associated with more severe pathogenesis and
higher lethality, including SARS-CoV-1 (emerged in 2002), MERS-CoV (in 2012), and most
recently SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19

1,2

. Despite the relevance of CoVs for

human health, our understanding of the factors governing their divergent pathogenicity remains
incomplete. Pathogenicity may be mediated by a variety of factors, including different specificities
and affinity for different cell surface receptors such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)
for SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 1,3 or 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for hCoV-OC434. CoV strains
also engage a variety of host immune processes in infected cells. Pathogenic strains more
strongly interfere with interferon I signaling 4,5 and induce apoptosis and pyroptosis 6–9. Ensembles
of virus-host protein-protein interactions (PPIs) orchestrate the reprogramming of these
processes during infection.
Coronaviruses possess the largest known RNA viral genomes, approximately 30kbp in
length. The 5’ 20 kb region of the genome encodes for two open reading frames (orf1a/1ab) that
produce 16 non-structural proteins (nsp1-nsp16) needed to form the viral replication complex,
while the 3’ proximal region encodes for the structural proteins and several accessory factors with
varying roles (Figure 1A). Previous protein-protein interaction studies of individual CoV proteins
have shed light on their functions in the infected host cells and putative roles during pathogenesis.
Yeast-two hybrid studies of coronavirus proteins have identified intraviral interactions10 and
interactions between nsp1 and immunophilins11, and a proximity-labeling approach was used to
determine host proteins concentrated in sites of replication12.
Affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) is a powerful tool to study virus-host
interactions and has been used extensively to examine how viruses reorganize host cells13–16. A
prior AP-MS study of SARS-CoV-1 nsp2 identified multiple host interactors including prohibitin

1/2 (PHB1/2)17. Most notably, Gordon et al. recently profiled host interactors for 26 SARS-CoV2 proteins18. While these studies enabled important insight on individual viral protein functions,
they focused on single CoV strains, limiting direct cross-strain comparisons.
Here, we sought to profile and compare the host interaction profiles of nsps from multiple
hCoVs,

namely

hCoV-OC43,

SARS-CoV-1,

and

SARS-CoV-2.

Through

comparative

interactomics, we identify both conserved and unique interactors across various strains. Notably,
quantitative analysis of interaction enrichment enables nuanced differentiation between shared
interactions for each coronavirus protein. Through this approach we discovered both conserved
and novel functions of viral proteins and the pathways by which they manipulate cellular
processes. Comparisons across strains may also provide clues into the evolutionary arms race
between virus and host proteins to hijack or protect protein-protein interfaces19. Additionally,
identified host dependencies can potentially be exploited as targets for host-directed antiviral
therapeutics.
In particular, we focus on the host interactors of nsp2 and nsp4. Nsp2 has been suggested to
play a role in modifying the host cell environment, although its precise function remains
unknown17. Nsp2 is dispensable for infection in SARS-CoV-1 20 and has pronounced amino acid
sequence differences across coronavirus strains (Figures 1B, S1A). Additionally, early sequence
analysis of SARS-CoV-2 identified regions of positive selection pressure in nsp221. Given the
variability of sequence across strains and the ambiguous function, a comparison of interaction
profiles across strains can yield insights into the role of nsp2. In contrast, the role of nsp4, a
transmembrane glycoprotein, is better defined, most notably in formation of the double-membrane
vesicles associated with replication complexes22,23. Unlike nsp2, nsp4 has a high degree of
sequence similarity across human coronavirus strains (Figures 1B, S1B).
In this study, we use affinity purification-proteomics to identify interactors of nsp2 from two
human coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2) and interactors of nsp4 from three strains
(OC43, SARS-CoV-1, and SARS-CoV-2). Quantitative comparative analysis of nsp2 interactors

identifies common protein binding partners, including the ERLIN1/2 complex and prohibitin
complex involved in regulation of mitochondrial function and calcium flux at ER-mitochondrial
contact sites. We also identify overlapping nsp4 interactors, including N-linked glycosylation
machinery, UPR associated factors, and anti-viral innate immune signaling proteins. Unique
interactors of different nsp4 homologs include E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes for SARS-CoV-1,
and ER homeostasis factors for SARS-CoV-2. In particular, we found nsp2 and nsp4 interactors
are strongly enriched for mitochondrial-associated ER membranes (MAM) factors, suggesting a
potential mechanism to affect calcium homeostasis and other host processes at these organelle
contact sites.

RESULTS

Design and validation of expression of CoV nsp2 and nsp4 constructs for affinity
purification
The two main open reading frames of the CoV viral genome, orf1a and orf1ab, encode for
16 non-structural proteins which perform a variety of tasks during the infection cycle (Figure 1A).
We focus our analysis on two of these proteins, nsp2 and nsp4. Nsp2 is a less functionally-well
understood protein with less than 70% amino acid sequence identity between the SARS-CoV-1
and SARS-CoV-2 homologs (Figures 1B, S1A). Nsp4 is a component of the CoV replication
complex that is 80 % identical between SARS strains, but only 42% between SARS and OC43
strains, a less clinically severe human CoV (Figures 1B, S1B).
To compare the virus-host protein-protein interactions of nsp2 and nsp4 across multiple
CoV strains, we designed FLAG-tagged expression constructs for affinity purification (Figure 1C).
SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 nsp2 constructs contain an N-terminal FLAG-tag, while the
SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and OC43 nsp4 constructs contain a C-terminal FLAG-tag. In
addition, nsp4 constructs contain a 19 amino acid leader sequence corresponding to the C5

terminus of nsp3, which includes the nsp3-PL2pro cleavage site for proper nsp4 translocation into
the ER membrane24,25.
Protein constructs were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells and proteins were
detected by immunoblotting for the FLAG-tag. While HEK293T cells are not representative of the
primary physiological target tissue, these cells are permissive to infection, and were able to
recapitulate strong interactors expected in lung tissue in a prior SARS-CoV-2 interactome study18.
The nsp2 constructs were detectable as a single protein band at the expected molecular weight
(Figure 1D), while nsp4 constructs displayed two distinct bands at a lower size than its expected
molecular weight (Figure 1E). This lower apparent molecular weight was previously reported and
the different bands likely correspond to different glycosylation states18. To ensure nsp4 is
expressed fully and the detected products do not correspond to a truncated protein, we
immunopurified the protein using FLAG-agarose beads and analyzed the purified protein by LCMS. We detected peptide fragments spanning the N- and C-termini with overall sequence
coverage of up to 62% (Figure S1C-E) confirming expression of the full proteins.

Affinity purification-mass spectrometry identifies nsp2 interactors
To identify host cell interaction partners of the distinct CoV non-structural proteins, we
employed an affinity purification-mass spectrometry workflow (Figure 2A). The protein constructs
were expressed in HEK293T cells, gently lysed in mild detergent buffer, and co-immunopurified
from whole cell lysates using anti-FLAG agarose beads. Virus-host protein complexes were then
reduced, alkylated, and trypsin digested. Importantly, we used tandem mass tag (TMT)-based
multiplexing using TMTpro-16plex or TMT-11plex for relative quantification of protein
abundances. For this purpose, 4 – 6 co-immunoprecipitation replicates for respective nsp2
homologs were pooled into a single MS run. Co-immunoprecipitations from mock GFP transfected
cells were included to differentiate non-specific background proteins (Figure 2B). Overall, the data

set included three individual MS runs containing 34 Co-IP (SARS-CoV-2 n = 13; SARS-CoV-1 n
= 9; GFP (mock) n = 12) (Figure S2A).
We first determined interactors of the individual nsp2 homologs by comparing the logtransformed TMT intensity differences for prey proteins between bait and GFP samples (Figure
2C-D). We optimized variable cutoffs for high- and medium-confidence interactors based on their
magnitude of enrichment compared to the GFP samples and confidence as defined by adjusted
p-values (Figure 2C-D, Figure S2B-C). Using the most stringent cutoff, we identified 6 and 11
high-confidence interactors for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 nsp2 respectively (Figure 2C-D).
Including medium-confidence interactors, we identified 20 nsp2 interactors for each homolog,
including four overlapping proteins, ERLIN1, ERLIN2, RNF170, and TMEM199 (Figure 2E).
Gene enrichment analysis shows nsp2 interactors are involved in a number of host cell
processes, including metabolic processing and transport (Figure S3A). A number of these
interactors are membrane-associated proteins in the ER and nucleus (Figure S3B). Detailed
comparisons of gene set enrichments for individual nsp2 homologs revealed several pathways
preferentially enriched for SARS-CoV-1, such as mitochondrial calcium ion transport, protein
deacetylation, and negative regulation of gene expression (Figure S3C). We confirmed by
immunofluorescence that SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 nsp2 are largely localized perinuclear
and co-localize partially with the ER marker PDIA4 (Figure S3D).
To validate our findings, we cross referenced our data set with previous coronavirus
interactomics studies. A prior study of SARS-CoV-1 nsp2 identified 11 host interactors, five of
which overlap with our SARS-CoV-1 list, including GIGYF2, PHB, PHB2, STOML2, and EIF4E2
17

. We also cross-referenced our interactors with a recently published SARS-CoV-2 interactomics

data set18. Interestingly, we identified 18 new interactors, though several of these share secondary
interactions with the proteins identified by Gordon et al. (Figure S4).

Apart from determining nsp2 host cell interactors, we sought to understand to what degree
interactions vary between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Our multiplexed analysis enabled
direct comparison of TMT intensities between the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 nsp2 Co-IPs
(Figure 3A). We validated that nsp2 bait levels are largely invariable across the replicates,
enabling the direct comparison of prey protein intensities (Figure S2D). We find a subset of
interactors are clearly enriched for SARS-CoV-1, including GIGYF2, HDAC8, EIF432, and PHB2
(Figure 3A). In contrast, several other interactors are enriched more strongly for SARS-CoV-2, for
instance FOXK1 and NR2F2.
We performed unbiased hierarchical clustering of the enrichment intensities to group the
nsp2 interactors in an unbiased way. This analysis yielded four distinct clusters. Clusters 1 and 2
contained shared interactors between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 nsp2. On the other hand,
clusters 3 and cluster 4 contained proteins that bound exclusively to either SARS-CoV-2 or SARSCoV-1, respectively (Figure 3B). To better visualize the relationship between shared and unique
nsp2 interactors, we constructed a network plot (Figure 3C). We also included experimentally
validated secondary interactions from the STRING database to group shared and unique
interactors into functionally relevant subclusters.
Several of these subclusters are shared between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 nsp2,
for instance one including STOML2, PHB, PHB2, VDAC2. These proteins were previously shown
to interact and upregulate formation of metabolically active mitochondrial membranes26. Another
subcluster involves ERLIN1, ERLIN2, and RNF170, which form a known complex regulating
ubiquitination and degradation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), which in turn are
channels regulating Ca2+ signaling from the ER to the mitochondria. Consistent with this, we
detect mitochondrial calcium ion transmembrane transport as one of the unique biological
processes associated with SARS-CoV-1 nsp2, but not SARS-CoV-2 (Figure S3C). Interestingly,
ERLIN1 and ERLIN2 show stronger interactions with SARS-CoV-1 nsp2 than with SARS-CoV-2,
whereas RNF170 interactions are similar, indicating some strain-specific preference. Additional

shared interactors include a subunit of the vacuolar ATPase (ATP6AP1) and a regulatory protein
(TMEM199), supporting a common role for nsp2 to influence lysosomal processes. Finally, we
observe one cytosolic and one ER-resident Hsp70 chaperone (HSPA8, HSP5) as shared
interactors, highlighting their role in nsp2 folding and biogenesis.
Unique SARS-CoV-2 interactors include FOXK1 and NR2F2, both of which are anti-viral
transcription factors induced in response to other viruses27,28. We also observe an exonuclease
regulator of endosomal nucleic acid sensing (PLD3)29, a transcription factor associated with the
influenza humoral response (MAZ)30,31, and a DNA-binding protein implicated in B cell class
switching (KIN or KIN17)32. In contrast, the list of unique SARS-CoV-1 interactors includes
components of the 4EFP-GYF2 translation repression complex (GYGYF2, EIF4E2), lysosomal
ion channels involved in chloride/proton ion exchange (CLCN7, OSTM1), and the cytosolic
histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). While SARS-CoV-1 interactors GIGYF2 and EIF4E2 were also
identified in the recent SARS-CoV-2 nsp2 dataset18, it is clear from our quantitative comparison
that enrichment of this complex with SARS-CoV-2 nsp2 is much weaker than with SARS-CoV-1
nsp2.

Comparative profiling of CoV nsp4 interactions
We extended our comparative analysis of host cell interactors to another CoV nonstructural protein nsp4 involved in the replication complex. We applied the same AP-MS workflow
used to identify nsp2 interactors (Figure 2A). In addition to SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 nsp4,
we also included the hCoV-OC43 nsp4 construct. With this addition, we sought to probe the
protein-protein interactions that differentiate strains causing severe pathogenesis versus nonsevere. To this end, four co-immunoprecipitation replicates of respective nsp4 homologs were
pooled into a single MS run, along with mock GFP transfected cells to differentiate non-specific
background proteins (Figure 2B). The full data set included three individual MS runs, containing
40 Co-IPs (SARS-CoV-2 n = 12; SARS-CoV-1 n = 8; OC43 = 8; GFP (mock) n = 12) (Figure S5A).

As previously described, we optimized variable cutoffs for high- and medium-confidence
interactors based on their magnitude enrichment compared to GFP samples (Figures 4A, S5BC). We identified 29, 20, and 13 high-confidence interactors for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and
OC43 respectively using the most stringent cutoff (Figures 4A, S5B-C). Including mediumconfidence interactors, we identified 86, 126, and 93 nsp4 interactors for SARS-CoV-2, SARSCoV-1, and OC43 nsp4 homologs respectively. Comparisons of high-confidence interactors
yielded 17 shared interactors between all strains (Figure 4B) or 30 medium-confidence shared
interactions (Figure S5D).
There is relatively little overlap between our identified SARS-CoV-2 nsp4 interactors and
published nsp4 interactomics data, including the recently published study of the SARS-CoV-2
interactome18 (Figure S6). The discrepancy could be attributed to the nsp4 constructs in our study
including the N-terminal residues of nsp3, which were added to ensure proper localization and
prevent the hydrophobic N-terminal region of nsp4 to serve as signal sequence24.
Analysis of GO-terms associated with the nsp4 interactors showed multiple enriched
biological processes, such as cell organization and biogenesis, transport, and metabolic
processes (Figure S7A). Interestingly, several shared SARS nsp4 interactors are associated with
cell death, cellular communication, and cell differentiation. Shared interactors of all three strains
are predominantly ER-membrane associated proteins, while many SARS-CoV-1 and OC43
specific interactors are annotated as nuclear-localized (Figure S7B). Comparisons of gene set
enrichment analysis between strains indicate the ERAD pathway is significantly enriched for
SARS strains, most strongly for SARS-CoV-1 (Figure S7C). Ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic
processes and ER mannose trimming are also strongly enriched for SARS-CoV-1. In general,
processes strongly enriched for SARS-CoV-1 are less enriched for SARS-CoV-2, and to an even
lesser extend for OC43.
Our multiplexed analysis of nsp4 homolog Co-IPs enabled direct comparison across
strains (Figure S8A-C). We validated that nsp4 bait levels were mostly similar across replicates,

allowing for direct comparison of bait protein intensities (Figure S8D). Unbiased hierarchical
clustering of enrichment intensities to group nsp4 interactors yielded four distinct clusters.
Clusters 1 contained common interactors of all nsp4 homologs (Figure 4C), while cluster 3
contains shared interactors of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1 nsp4 that displayed weaker
enrichment with OC43. In contrast, cluster 2 and 4 contained unique interactors enriched for
OC43 and SARS-CoV-1 nsp4, respectively. To visualize functionally relevant subclusters of
shared and unique nsp4 interactors, we constructed a network plot, including high-confidence
interactions (score > 0.75) from the String database (Figure 4D). Inclusion of all medianconfidence interactors of the nsp4 homologs yielded a similar clustering and network organization
(Figures S8E, S9).
We identified several common interactors across all three nsp4 homologs. These include
components of UPR signaling (TMEM33) and ER-phagy (CCPG1). We also identify RNF5, an
ER-localized E3 ubiquitin ligase known to modulate anti-viral innate immune signaling33,34, and
VKORC1, which reduces Vitamin K, a key cofactor for several coagulation factor proteins35. Not
surprisingly, given that nsp4 is a glycosylated protein, we also identify several members of the Nlinked glycosylation machinery (STT3B, MAGT1, CANX, DDOST) (Figure 4D) in all three strains.
We identified several shared interactors between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 that
were absent in OC43. These include the ERLIN1/2 complex, LONP1, HERPUD1, GET4, and
BAG2, all of which are involved in a facet of ER homeostasis, proteostasis or trafficking (Figure
4D). The ERLIN1/2 complex was also identified in the nsp2 data set (Figure 3B-C) and shows
comparable enrichment values between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, the other
four overlapping interactors all exhibit increased enrichment for SARS-CoV-2 versus SARS-CoV1. LONP1 is a mitochondrial peptidase responsible for removing the majority of damaged
mitochondrial proteins via proteolysis. The unfolded protein response (UPR) induces HERPUD1
expression, which is involved in the ER-associated degradation pathway (ERAD) to maintain ER
homeostasis 36. BAG2 serves as a co-chaperone for HSP70 chaperones, acting as a nucleotide

was more greatly enriched for SARS-CoV-1. Consistent with this observation, we identified sterol
metabolic process as one of the unique processes enriched for OC43 nsp4.
In addition to shared interactors, we found several unique interactors for SARS-CoV-2,
including the monoubiquitin-ribosomal fusion protein (RPS27A), a Golgi/ER-resident zinc receptor
that has been shown to regulate TNF receptor trafficking and necroptosis (SLC39A7), and the
ER-resident Hsp70 chaperone BiP (HSPA5). The latter two play distinct roles in regulating ER
homeostasis and proteostasis. In contrast, only two unique OC43 nsp4 interactors were identified:
a target of the NEDD8-Cullin E3 ligase pathway (MRFAP1)48 and FAM120A, an RNA-binding
protein found to serve as a scaffolding protein for the IL13 signaling pathway (Figure S8B-C) 49,50.
Both of these proteins are localized to the nucleus (Figure S7B). Lastly, we identified a large
cluster of unique SARS-CoV-1 nsp4 interactors that compose the CTLH E3 ubiquitin ligase
complex (Figure 4D). This nuclear complex maintains cell proliferation rates, likely through the
ubiquitination of the transcription factor Hbp1, a negative regulator of cell proliferation51. This
complex is highly enriched for SARS-CoV-1 specifically, presenting one of the most profound
differences in interaction profile (Figure S8A,C).
The fact that both OC43 and SARS-CoV-1 nsp4 displayed prominent interactions with
nuclear proteins prompted us to evaluate the cellular localization of the protein by
immunofluorescence. We detected perinuclear puncti for all constructs which partially co12

localized with the ER marker PDIA4 (Figure S10), consistent with prior studies22. However, for
SARS-CoV-1 and OC43 nsp4, we also detected measurable signal in the nucleus, supporting a
nuclear function and the observed interactions with protein in the nucleus.

Enrichment of mitochondria-associated membrane proteins as nsp2 and nsp4 interactors
In our evaluation of cellular compartment GO-terms, we noticed that nsp2 and nsp4
interactors are enriched in membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondria
(Figures S3B, S7B). In particular, ERLIN1/2 and RNF170 form an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex
known to localize to the interface between the ER and mitochondria, regions termed mitochondriaassociated membranes (MAMs). We therefore probed our data set for any other MAMsassociated nsp2 and nsp4 interactors. We cross-referenced our interactor lists with three
published data sets that specifically characterized the MAMs proteome52–54 and identified 17
proteins associated with MAMs (Figure 5A-B). Seven of these factors solely interact with nsp2,
eight proteins solely interact with one or more strains of nsp4, and the ERLIN1/2 complex interacts
with both nsp2 and nsp4 (Figure 3C, 4D). Interestingly, the ERLIN1/2 complex only interacts with
SARS-CoV-1 and -2 proteins and not OC43. SARS-CoVs may use ERLIN1/2 to regulate ER Ca2+
signaling and the myriad of downstream host processes controlled by this signaling pathway
(Figure 5C).

DISCUSSION
Our analysis enables both the identification of interactors for SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2,
and OC43 homologs of nsp2 and nsp4, and comparative quantitative enrichment to differentiate
between shared and unique host cell binding partners. We acknowledge the limitations of using
transiently transfected viral proteins for AP-MS. Viral infection results in a collection of both
protein-protein and RNA-protein interactions and our approach cannot account for how these
events influence the interactions of nsp2 and nsp4. However, given the logistical barriers to

handling BSL-3 viruses, paired with the urgency of the current pandemic, our workflow is an
efficient system to perform comparative analysis and generate a shortlist of interactors to prioritize
for further investigation.
We identify several nsp2 interactors shared across SARS strains, including STOML2, and
prohibitins (PHB and PHB2), which were previously identified as interacting with SARS-CoV-117.
These proteins work in tandem to induce formation of metabolically active mitochondrial
membranes to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis. Increased levels of STOML2 are associated
with increased ATP production and reduced apoptosis induction26. This conserved interaction for
SARS strains presents an avenue for nsp2 to increase mitochondrial metabolism and stall
apoptosis to maintain a pro-viral cellular environment. Additionally, STOML2 has been found to
play a key role in stabilizing hepatitis C virus replication complexes55 and PHB has been shown
to promote entry of both Chikungunya virus56 and enterovirus 7157. These factors may prove
effective pan-RNA virus targets for host-directed therapies.
For nsp4, we identify multiple unique SARS-CoV-1 interactors, most notably members of
the CTLH E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This complex is known to regulate levels of Hbp1, a
negative regulator of proliferative genes51 and was previously shown to interact with the dengue
viral protein NS2B315, implicating this complex as a target for RNA viruses to influence cell
proliferation. We also identified the FBXO45-MYCBP2 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which has
been shown to prevent cell death in mitosis 58. Together, this may support a role in SARS-CoV-1
nsp4 co-opting host ubiquitin complexes to extend cell viability during infection to promote viral
replication.
Furthermore, we find components of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, IDI1 and
DHCR7, which were specifically enriched for SARS-CoV-1 and OC43 nsp4 respectively. IDI1 has
been shown to be downregulated by host cells in response to CMV-infection-induced interferons44
and is upregulated by both HIV and HCV during infection45,46. DHCR7 is downregulated during
RNA virus infection in macrophages to promote IRF3 signaling and IFN-1 production. Moreover,

inhibition of DHCR7 aids in clearance of multiple RNA viruses47. These previous findings indicate
that interactions with IDI1 and DHCR7 may provide means for coronaviruses to counteract antiviral responses. Interestingly, these interactions with the aforementioned E3 ligase complexes
and cholesterol biogenesis factors are not enriched for SARS-CoV-2 nsp4, implying that SARSCoV-2 pathogenesis may not require these interactions.
As a whole, it appears that SARS-CoV-2 homologs differ from SARS-CoV-1 not by gaining
new interactions, but rather by losing network nodes. This is emphasized in the gene enrichment
analysis of nsp2 and nsp4 (Figure S3C, S7C), in which multiple pathways are more strongly
enriched for SARS-CoV-1, as well as in the nsp4 interactome (Figure 4C-D), particularly with the
absence of E3 ligase complex interactions for SARS-CoV-2. It will be important to investigate
potential functional implications of the engagement of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, as well innate
immune signaling factors on CoV infections and the course of pathogenicity for the divergent
strains.
A particularly noteworthy finding is the identification of 17 MAMs factors in the combined
nsp2 and nsp4 datasets, based on cross-referencing interactors with previously published
proteomics studies of MAMs proteins52–54. Given the prominence of these interactions, it is
tempting to speculate that nsp2 and nsp4 localize to MAMs and influence processes at these
important organelle contact sites (Figure 5C). MAMs are nodes for innate immune signaling and
apoptosis pathways, both of which are common targets for viral manipulation.
In particular, we identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF5 interacting with all nsp4 homologs.
RNF5 targets STING for degradation, which stabilizes retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and
mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) interactions at MAMs, thereby inducing inteferon1 and -3 production via IRF3 and NF-kB signaling33,34. RIG-I is one of the main viral RNA genome
sensors in host cells; therefore, it is possible that nsp4 increases targeting of RNF5 to MAMs to
inhibit downstream signaling of RIG-1.

We also identify the ERLIN1/2 complex in both nsp2 and nsp4 data sets. In the nsp2
interaction network, the complex is associated with a different E3 ligase, RNF170. RNF170 has
been shown to inhibit innate immune signaling by targeting TLR3 for degradation, thereby
blocking IRF3 and NF-kB signaling pathways59. In addition, ERLIN1/2 acts in concert with
RNF170 to target the inositol-1,4,5-triphophate receptor (IP3R) for degradation via
polyubiquination60. IP3R is an ER-resident Ca2+ channel integral in the formation of MAMs61,62.
Calcium flux at MAMs has been shown to increase mitochondrial calcium uptake, which increases
ATP production, thereby benefitting active viral replication63. Indeed, several other viruses have
been shown to influence ER Ca2+ exchange, such as the rotavirus protein NSP4 and the HIV-1
protein Nef, which both cause depletion of ER Ca2+ stores through modulation of IP3R activity64.
Another prominent example includes the human cytomegalovirus protein vMIA, which increases
ER Ca2+ export at MAMs through IP3R into the mitochondria 63. Previous studies have shown the
SARS-CoV-1 E protein acts as a channel to leak ER calcium stores during infection65, but to our
knowledge, no such features have been attributed to either nsp2 or nsp4. Thus, manipulation of
ER Ca2+ signaling via IP3R regulation may represent a novel method by which coronaviruses
manipulate mitochondrial function (Figure 5C). In support of this, a recent study found that IP3R
is significantly reduced during SARS-CoV-2 infection66. Further studies will be important to
evaluate whether ER calcium exchange and mitochondrial metabolism could impact coronavirus
infection.

METHODS

Protein Expression constructs
Coding sequences for nsp2 and nsp4 were obtained from GenBank (MN908947 SARS-CoV-2
isolate Wuhan-Hu-1; AY278741 SARS-CoV-1 Urbani; NC_006213 hCoV OC43 strain ATCC VR759). Human codon optimized sequences were designed, genes synthesized, and cloned into

(nsp2) to append an N-terminal FLAG tag (GenScript).

Cell Culture and Transfection
HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) with high
glucose and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and
1% glutamine. Cells were kept at 37°C, 5% CO2. Generally, 2 x 106 cells were seeded into 10cm
dishes. 24 hours post-seeding, cells were transfected with 5µg nsp2, nsp4, or fluorescent control
DNA constructs in pcDNA3.1-(+)-C/N-DYK vectors using a calcium phosphate method. Media
was exchanged 16 hours post-transfection, and cells were harvested 24 hours after changing
media.

Immunoprecipitation
Cells were collected and washed with PBS. Immunoprecipitation samples were lysed by
resuspension in TNI buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150mM NaCl, 0.5% IGEPAL-CA-630) with Roche
cOmplete protease inhibitor on ice for at least 10 minutes, followed by sonication in a room
temperature water bath for 10 minutes. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 17,000 x g for
10-20 minutes. Sepharose 4B resin (Sigma) and G1 anti-DYKDDDDK resin (GenScript) were prewashed 4x with the respective lysis buffer for each sample. Protein concentrations in cleared
lysates were normalized using BioRad Protein Assay Dye and added to 15 µL Sepharose 4B
resin for 1 hour, rocking at 4°C. Resin was collected by centrifugation for 5-10 minutes at 400 x g
and pre-cleared supernatant was added directly to 15 µL G1 anti-DYKDDDDK resin and rocked
at 4°C overnight. The next day, supernatant was removed and resin was washed 4 times with the
respective lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with the addition of modified 3x Laemelli buffer
(62.5 mM Tris, 6% SDS) for 30 minutes at room temperature followed by 15 minutes at 37°C,
followed by a second elution for 5-15 minutes at 37°C. 10% of elution was set aside for SDS17

PAGE and silver staining to confirm immunoprecipitation efficiency, and the remainder was
prepared for mass spectrometry. Silver staining was performed using a Pierce Silver Stain kit
(Thermo Scientific).

Tandem Mass Tag Sample Preparation
Sample preparation was carried out as described67. Briefly, eluted proteins were precipitated in
methanol/chloroform/water (3:1:3), washed twice in methanol, and protein pellets were air dried.
Pellets were resuspended in 1% Rapigest SF (Waters), reduced, and alkylated. Proteins were
digested in trypsin-LysC overnight. Digested peptides were labeled using 11-plex or 16-plex
tandem mass tag (TMT or TMTpro) reagents (Thermo Scientific), pooled, and acidified using
formic acid. Cleaved Rapigest was removed by centrifugation of samples at 17,000 x g for 30 min.

MudPIT liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry Analysis
Triphasic MudPIT microcolumn were prepared as described68. Individual pooled TMT proteomics
samples were directly loaded onto the microcolumns using a high-pressure chamber followed by
a wash with 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in water (v/v) for 30 min. Peptides were analyzed
by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry on an Exploris 480 in line with an Ultimate 3000
nanoLC system (Thermo Fisher). The MudPIT microcolumns were installed on a column
switching valve on the nanoLC systems followed by 20 cm fused silica microcapillary column (ID
100µm) ending in a laser-pulled tip filled with Aqua C18, 3µm, 100 Å resin (Phenomenex). MudPIT
runs were carried out by 10µL sequential injection of 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 % buffer C (500mM
ammonium acetate, 94.9% water, 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid), followed by a final injection
of 90% C, 10% buffer B (99.9% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid v/v). Each injection was followed by
a 130 min gradient using a flow rate of 500nL/min (0 – 6 min: 2% buffer B, 8 min: 5% B, 100 min:
35% B, 105min: 65% B, 106 – 113 min: 85% B, 113 – 130 min: 2% B). Electrospray ionization
was performed directly from the tip of the microcapillary column using a spray voltage of 2.2 kV,

ion transfer tube temperature of 275ºC and RF Lens of 40%. MS1 spectra were collected using
the following settings: scan range 400 – 1600 m/z, 120,000 resolution, AGC target 300%, and
automatic injection times. Data-dependent tandem mass spectra were obtained using the
following settings: monoisotopic peak selection mode: peptide, included charge state 2 – 7,
TopSpeed method (3s cycle time), isolation window 0.4 m/z, HCD fragmentation using a
normalized collision energy of 32, resolution 45,000, AGC target 200%, automatic injection times,
and dynamic exclusion (20 ppm window) set to 60 s.

Experimental layout and data analysis
The nsp2 AP-MS experiments included three individual MS runs combining 34 Co-AP samples
(SARS-CoV-2 n = 13; SARS-CoV-1 n = 9; GFP (mock) n = 12). Samples were distributed to
TMTpro 16plex or TMT11plex channels as outlined in Figure S2A. The nsp4 AP-MS experiments
consisted of three individual MS runs, containing 40 Co-IPs (SARS-CoV-2 n = 12; SARS-CoV-1
n = 8; OC43 = 8; GFP (mock) n = 12). Samples were distributed to TMTpro 16plex channels as
outlined in Figure S5A. Identification and quantification of peptides and proteins were carried out
in Proteome Discoverer 2.4 (Thermo Fisher) using a SwissProt human database (Tax ID 9606,
release date 11/23/2019). CoV nsp2 and nsp4 protein sequences were added manually.
Searches were conducted in Sequest HT using the following setting: Trypsin cleavage with max.
2 missed cleavage sites, minimum peptide length 6, precursor mass tolerance 20 ppm, fragment
mass tolerance 0.02 Da, dynamic modifications: Met oxidation (+15.995 Da), Protein N-terminal
Met loss (-131.040 Da), Protein N-terminal acetylation (+42.011 Da), static modifications: Cys
carbamidomethylation (+57.021 Da), TMTpro or TMT6plex at Lys and N-termini (+304.207 Da for
TMTpro or +229.163 for TMT6plex). Peptide IDs were filtered using the Percolator node using an
FDR target of 0.01. Proteins were filtered based on a 0.01 FDR requiring two peptide IDs per
protein, and protein groups were created according to a strict parsimony principle. TMT reporter
ions were quantified using the reporter ion quantification considering unique and razor peptides,

and excluding peptides with co-isolation interference greater than 25%. Peptide abundances were
normalized based on total peptide amounts in each channel assuming similar levels of
background signal in the APs. Protein quantification roll-up used all quantified peptides. Pairwise
ratios between conditions were calculated based on total protein abundances and ANOVA on
individual proteins was used to test for changes in abundances and to report adjusted p-values.
To filter high-confidence interactors of individual CoV nsp proteins, we used a variable filter
combining log2 fold enrichment and adjusted p-value according to a published method69. Briefly,
the histogram of log2 protein abundance fold changes between nsp-transfected versus mocktransfected groups were fitted to a gaussian curve using a nonlinear least square fit to determine
the standard deviation s (see Figure S2B-C). Fold change cutoffs for high-confidence and
medium-confidence interactors were based on 2 s, or 1 s, respectively. For actual cutoffs taking
into consideration adjusted p-values, we utilized a hyperbolic curve y > c / (x – x0), where y is the
adj. p-value, x the log2 fold change, x0 corresponds to the standard deviation cutoff (2 s or 1 s),
and c is the curvature (c = 0.4 for 1 s, and 0.8 for 2 s). (see Figures 2C-D, 4A, S5B-C).

Gene set enrichment analysis
GO-term categories for biological processes and cellular components for interactors were based
on assignment in the Proteome Discoverer Protein Annotation node. Gene set enrichment
analysis was conducted in EnrichR70. The analysis was conducted separately for sets of
interactors of individual nsp2 or nsp4 homologs, and GO-terms for biological processes were
filtered by adjusted p-values < 0.1. Redundant GO-terms were grouped manually based on
overlapping genes in related terms.

Extended and overlapping interactomes between novel interactors identified in this study and
previously published interactors18 were generated by scraping the top n interactors of each
primary prey protein on the STRING database using the python API. We established an extended
secondary interactome by searching for the top 20 and top 30 STRING db interactors of the nsp4
primary interactors and nsp2 interactors respectively using limit parameter in STRING API and
searching against the human proteome (species 9606). We then compared the extended
interactomes of our data with the previously published data by dropping any secondary interactors
that did not appear in both data sets. Next, we concatenated the primary interactors from our data,
the primary interactors from the published data, and the overlapping secondary interactors into a
single data frame. Finally, we searched the overlapping secondary interactors against the
STRING database human proteome to determine interactors between secondary interactors with
a threshold of greater than 50% likelihood in the experimental score category. The results were
plotted in Cytoscape.

Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy
HEK293T cells were cultured on glass-bottom culture dishes (MatTek, P35G-0-14-C) and
transfected with CoV expression constructs as previously described. Cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde-PBS, washed thrice with PBS, then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton-X (in PBS).
After three PBS washes, cells were blocked in PBS with 1% BSA with 0.1% Saponin (blocking
buffer). After blocking, cells were incubated with anti-PDIA4 primary antibody (Protein Tech,
14712-1-AP) in blocking buffer (1:1000 dilution) for 1 hour at 37°C. After three PBS washes, cells
were incubated with AlexFluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit goat antibody (ThermoFisher, A-11008)
in blocking buffer (1:500 dilution) at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were then stained with
M2 FLAG primary antibody (SigmaAldrich, F1804) and AlexFluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse
goat antibody (ThermoFisher, A-11005) using the same conditions. Cells were then mounted in

(A) General AP-MS workflow to quantitatively determine interactors of viral nsp homolog.
HEK293T cells are transfected with FLAG-tagged expression constructs of nsps as bait or GFP
(mock) and lysed. Bait proteins are immunoprecipitated (IP) along with interacting proteins,
reduced, alkylated, and tryptic digested. Peptides are then tandem-mass tag (TMT) labeled,
pooled, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS for identification and quantification.
(B) Data processing workflow. Peptide spectra are identified and matched to corresponding
proteins (SEQUEST HT), then quantified based on TMT reporter ion intensity (Proteome
Discoverer 2.4). High confidence interactors are filtered by comparing bait vs control. Interaction
ratios between bait homologs are determined (log2 fold change) and adjusted p-value
calculated using ANOVA.
(C-D) Volcano plot of SARS-CoV-2 nsp2 (C) and SARS-CoV-1 nsp2 (D) datasets to identify
medium- and high-confidence interactors. Plotted are log2 TMT intensity fold changes for
proteins between nsp2 bait channels and GFP mock transfections versus -log10 adjusted pvalues. Curves for the variable cutoffs used to define high-confidence (red) or medium
confidence (blue) interactors are shown. 1s = 0.5 for (C), 1s = 0.43 for (D).
(E) Venn diagram comparing high-confidence interactors between nsp2 homologs. Sixteen
unique proteins were identified each, while four proteins overlapped both data sets (listed in
adjacent table).

(A) Volcano plot comparing interactions between nsp2 homolog from SARS-CoV-1 and SARSCoV-2. Only high- and medium confidence interactors of nsp2 are shown. Highlighted proteins
meet the filter criteria of adjusted p-value < 0.05 and | log2 fold change | >1.
(B) Heatmap comparing the enrichment of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 nsp2 interactors
compared to GFP control. log2 fold change is color-coded and centered by row (blue low, yellow
high enrichment). Hierarchical clustering using Ward’s method shown on the left was carried out
on euclidean distances of log2 fold changes scaled by row. Clusters 1 and 2 corresponds to
shared interactors of SARS-CoV-1 and -2 nsp2, while cluster 3 and 4 for are unique interactors
for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 nsp2, respectively.
(C) Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network map of nsp2 homologs. Blue lines indicate viralhost PPIs, where line width corresponds to fold enrichment compared to the GFP control. Grey
lines indicate annotated host-host PPIs in STRING (score > 0.75). Groups of interactors with a
common functional role are highlighted.
