Abstract
Since the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) in several somatic cells, little is known about the infection of
SASRS-CoV-2 and its related pangolin coronavirus (GX_P2V). Here we present for
the first time that SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and GX_P2V could infect lung
progenitor and even anterior foregut endoderm cells causing these cells death, which
differentiated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). The infection and
replication of SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V were inhibited when treated with whey
protein of breastmilk and Remdesivir, confirming that these two viruses could infect
lung progenitor and even anterior foregut endoderm. Moreover, we found that
SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus could infect endoderm and ectoderm. We found that whey
protein blocked SARS-CoV-2 infecting these cells. In line with the SARS-CoV-2
results, GX_P2V could also infected endoderm and ectoderm, and also was inhibited
by Remdesivir treatment. Although expressing coronavirus related receptor such as
ACE2 and TMPRSS2, mesoderm cells are not permissive for SARS-CoV-2 and
GX_P2V infection, which needed further to study the mechanisms. Interestingly, we
also found that hESCs, which also express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 markers, are
permissive for GX_P2V but not SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection and replication,
indicating the widespread cell types for GX_P2V infection.

Heparin treatment

blocked efficiently viral infection. These results provided insight that these stem cells
maybe provided a stable repository of coronavirus function or genome. The potential
consequence of SARS-CoV-2 and animal coronavirus such as GX_P2V infection in
hESCs, germ layer and induced progenitors should be closely monitored.

Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the novel coronavirus,
SARS-CoV-2, was declared a pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) and
resulted in over 30 million confirmed cases and more than 800 thousand deaths over
the world since its outbreak. Although respiratory failure is the most common
mortality outcome in COVID-19 patients, other fatal manifestations are also existed in
multiple organ systems, including the heart, brain and gastrointestinal tract 1. It’s
reported that nearly 25% of the 400 COVID-19 patients had suffered in-hospital
cardiac injury 2. Nearly 25% of the COVID-19 patients had gastrointestinal symptom,
including anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal pain, indicating that
SARS-CoV-2 may infects gastrointestinal cells 3. Interestingly, a recent Germany
study demonstrated that positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected in human brain
biopsies in 36.4% of fatal COVID-19 cases 4. Recently, a group found that
SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus could infect pancreatic endocrine cells, liver organoids,
cardiomyocytes and dopaminergic neurons derived from human pluripotent stem cells
(hPSCs) 5. All these findings highlight the potential of viral infection in several organs
and even stem cells. However, there has been no direct experimental evidence of
SARS-CoV-2 infection in different differentiation stages of human embryonic stem
cells. A recent clinical study showed that SARS-CoV-2 related receptors, such as
ACE2 and TMPRSS2, also express in the trophoblast of the blastocyst and
tiotrophoblast and hypoblast of the implantation stages, indicating that the embryo
may support SARS-CoV-2 infection resulting potential risks for vertical transmission
and fetal health 6. Importantly, a recent study showed that SARS-CoV-2 could also
infect human neural progenitor cells, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 could infect and
replicate in widespread cell types even stem cells. Together, these findings suggest
that the different stages of human embryonic stem cells differentiation might also be
the susceptible for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Materials and Methods

Maintenance of hESCs
hESCs were maintained in mTeSRTM1 medium (STEMCELL Technologies,
Vancouver, Canada) as we previously described with daily medium replenishment.
Cells were passaged with ReleSR (STEMCELL Technologies) when cells reach
approximately 80% confluence. Cells were cultured in a 5% CO2 air environment.

Other cell lines, coronavirus and key reagents
Vero E6 cells were cultured in high-glucose-containing Dulbecco's Modified Eagle
Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. GX_P2V was described
recently7. SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus was kindly shared by Prof. Youchun Wang
(National Institutes for Food and Drug Control, China)8. Goat and cow whey proteins
were purchased from Sigma (USA). Heparin was purchased from Sigma (USA).
Remdesivir was purchased from Sigma (USA).

Stem cell differentiation
Endoderm: The hESCs were differentiated into definitive endoderm using the
commercial STEMdiff Definitive Endoderm kit (STEMCELL Technologies)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, hESCs were dissociated into
single cells with Accutase and plated onto Matrigel coated plates. The next day,
differentiation was induced by media A of the STEMdiff Definitive Endoderm kit for
one day and then media B for more three days.
Mesoderm: mesoderm induced differentiation was performed by the STEMdiff
Mesoderm induction Medium (STEMCELL Techonoloties) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, dissociated hESCs cells were plated onto the
Matrigel-coated (BD) plates with ROCK inhibitor of Y-27632 (STEMCELL
Technologies) at the concentration of 10 μ M. The next day, the medium was
exchanged with STEMdiff Mesoderm induction Medium for four days, with daily

medium replenishment.
Ectoderm: the neuroectoderm cells were induced by using the dual SMAD inhibition
method as previously described in the literature with some modifications. Briefly,
Single dissociated hESCs cells were plated on the Matrigel-coated plates with ROCK
inhibitor (Y-27632). The next day, ectoderm differentiation was performed with basal
Medium (DMEM/F12, 10% knockout serum replacement (KOSR) and 1% Glutamax)
supplemented with 10 μ M SB431542 (STEMCELL Technologies) and 200 nM
Noggin (Peprotech) for four days.

Induction of anterior foregut endoderm
For anterior foregut endoderm induction (hAFECs), the differentiation was performed
as described previously with some modification9. Briefly, the endodermal cells were
dissociated into single cells using Accutase and plated on the Matrigel-coated plates in
serum-free differentiation media (SFM) supplemented with 1.5 μM Dorsomorphin
dihydrochloride (R&D System) and 10 μM SB431542 for 24h. The next day, the
media were exchanged with SFM supplemented with 10 μM SB431542 and 1 μM
IWP2 (R&D System) for two days. SFM: DMEM/F12 supplemented with N2, B27,
50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 2 mM Glutamax, 0.4 μM and 0.05% bovine serum albumin
(BSA).

Induction of lung progenitors
For human lung progenitor cells (hLPCs) induction, the induced hAFECs was
cultured with the SFM medium supplemented with 3 μM CHIR99021 (STEMCELL
Technologies), 10 ng/ml BMP4 (Peprotech), 20 ng/ml FGF10 (Peprotech), 10 ng/ml
FGF7 (Peprotech) and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) (Sigma) for 8 days, with every
other day medium replenishment.

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection was performed as previously described10. The
cells were infected with viral inocula of 650 TCID50/well8. One day post infection
(1dpi), the cells were lysed and the luminescence was measured according to the
manufacture’s protocol. Cells were infected with GX_P2V at multiplicity of infection
(MOI) of 0.01 as described11. Remdsivir, heparin and human breastmilk were utilized
to inhibit viral infection and replication during the infection process.

mRNA quantification
GX_P2V RNA quantification was performed by RT-qPCR as previously described11.
Briefly, total RNA was extracted by the AxyPrep™ multisource total RNA Miniprep
kit (Axygene). Hifair II 1st Strand cDNA synthesis kit with gDNA digester (Yeasen)
was used to synthesize the first strand complementary DNA (cDNA). Hieff qPCR
SYBR Green Master Mix (Yeasen) was used to quantify GX_P2V RNA. The
RT-qPCR amplification of the Taqman method was performed as follows: 50°C for 2
min, 95°C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles consisting of 95°C for 10 s, 60°C for 1
min. The markers related such as Sox2, FoxA2, NKx2.1, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were
quantified by RT-qPCR normalized by RPS11. The primers were shown in
supplementary table 1.

Western blotting
Western blotting was performed as described previously12. Antibodies against
nucleocapsid protein of anti-SARS-CoV-2 N protein (Genscript) and GAPDH of
anti-GAPDH (Proteintech) were used at 1:3000 dilutions. The second antibody of
HRP-conjugated affinipure Goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) was diluted at 1:20000.
SuperSignal® West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Chemiluminescent Substrate
(Thermo Scientific, USA) was used for imaging.

Immunofluorescent assay
Cells were fixed by 4% para-formadehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at
room temperature for 10 min and permeabilized by 0.1% Triton-100 at room

temperature for 10 min. Then, the cells were blocked with blocking buffer (10% goat
serum and 1% BSA in PBS) for 1hr. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies
(diluted in blocking buffer) at 4℃ overnight. The primary antibodies are anti-OCT4
rabbit polyclonal antibody (Proteintech), anti-SSEA-4 antibody (STEMCELL
Technologies), anti-Sox17 antibody (R&D System), anti-Brachyury antibody (Cell
Signaling Technology) and ani-Nestin antibody (R&D System). The Alexa-488 or 594
conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000 diluted in blocking buffer) were added to the
cells in the dark at room temperature for 1 hr. Nuclei were stained with DAPI for 10
min at room temperature.

Plaque assay for determining virus titer
The plaque assay for determining virus titer was performed as previously described11.
Briefly, confluent monolayer Vero E6 cells were infected with GX_P2V with ten-fold
dilution from 10-1 to 10-6. After removing the virus, the cells were washed by PBS and
added with 1% agarose overlay to prevent cross-contamination. At 5 dpi, cells were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1h, followed by staining with Crystal violet for
10 min and washed with water. The plaques were counted and virus titers were
calculated.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8 software (GraphPad
Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Values are shown as mean of triplicates.
Comparisons between the two groups were analyzed using the Student's t tests. Values
of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
To investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 infects human lung progenitor cells (hLPCs),
we first evaluated the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in hLPCs. Our data
suggested that both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, as well as lung progenitor markers of Sox2,
FoxA2 and NKx2.1, were detected in hLPCs (Fig. S1A and C). Then, we infected the
hLPCs with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus at viral inocula of 650 TCID50/well as
previously described13. As a result, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus could infect hLPCs and
the infection could be inhibited by breastmilk (2 mg/ml) , which was reported to have
anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity

13

(Fig. 1A). In line with the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus

results, we also infected hLPCs with SARS-CoV-2 related pangolin coronavirus
(GX_P2V) 7at 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) and found that GX_P2V RNA
could be detected in hLPCs11. After Remdesivir (1.5 μM) and human breastmilk (2
mg/ml) treatment, GX_P2V RNA level decreased significantly compared to the
control (Fig. 1B). In addition, we also analyzed the cell viability of GX_P2V infected
hLPCs. Accordingly, GX_P2V infection reduced the viability of hLPCs. Next, we
challenged the earlier stage cells of human anterior foregut endoderm (hAFECs) with
SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus (650 TCID50/well) and GX_P2V (MOI=0.1) for viral
infection assessment. We found that hAFECs markers and also ACE2 and TMPRSS2
expressed in the differentiated cells (Fig. S1B). Luciferase activity could be detected
and decreased after breastmilk (from both human and goat) treatment in hAFECs (Fig.
1C). Interestingly, GX_P2V RNA levels decreased during the Remdesivir (1.5 μM)
and human breastmilk (2 mg/ml) treatment in the hAFECs (Fig. 1D). In addition, we
also found that heparin could also significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus
infection (Fig. S2A-C), indicating heparins potential for treatment of SARS-CoV-2
infection, and the heparan sulphate could be the potential co-receptor for
SARS-CoV-2 infection14. These findings suggest that hLPCs and also hAFECs are
permissive for SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and GX_P2V infection.
To explore the possible permissive of endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm to
SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection, we generated hESCs into endoderm, mesoderm
and ectoderm according to the manufacturer’s instructions, respectively. As shown in

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.25.313270; this version posted September 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

Fig. 1E, the immunofluorescent assay showed that Sox17, Brachyury, nestin was
detected in endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm, respectively. In addition, ACE2 and
TMPRSS2 were also expressed in these cells (Fig. S1C). Next, we challenged these
cells with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and GX_P2V virus. As shown in Fig. 1F,
SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus could be detected in endoderm and ectoderm, but not
mesoderm. The SARS-CoV-2 infection could be inhibited by whey protein of human
and goat both in endoderm (Fig. 1G) and ectoderm (Fig. 1H). However, the cells
activity from hESCs, endoderm and ectoderm was influenced by human breastmilk
(data not shown). Interestingly, GX_P2V RNA was positive in endoderm and
ectoderm cells but not mesoderm, indicating the potential inhibitory activity or lack
key factors of mesoderm to SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection. After Remdesivir
(1.5 μM) treatment, GX_P2V RNA level was significantly lower compared to those
without any drug treatment both in endoderm (Fig. 1I) and ectoderm (Fig. 1J). We
found that GX_P2V nucleoprotein (NP) could be detected in endoderm and ectoderm
(Fig. 1K), but not in mesoderm (data not shown) by western blot assay. In addition,
we also challenged the Vero E6 cells with the supernatant collected from infected
endoderm and ectoderm to perform plaque assay. As results, both endoderm and
ectoderm could reproduce infectious viruses (Fig. 1N). These results indicated that
the germ layer cells such as endoderm and ectoderm are also permissive for both
SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection.
To further investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and GX_P2V infect
hESCs, the cultured hESCs were challenged by these two viruses. Firstly, we detected
the stem cell markers of OCT-4 and SSEA-4 by immunofluorescent assay. As shown
in Fig. 1E, OCT-4 and SSEA-4 staining were identified in the hESCs cells. We
infected the hESCs with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and GX_P2V, respectively.
Unfortunately, luciferase activity was undetected in the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus
infected hESCs cells (Fig. 1F). However, GX_P2V RNA was relative positive at 48
and 72 hours post infection (hpi) (Fig. 1L) and NP was positive in hESCs cells (Fig.
1M). Remdesivir also showed inhibitory activity to GX_P2V in these cells. Plaque
assay results showed that hESCs could also produce infectious GX_P2V. These

results indicated that hESCs are not permissive for SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus but
permissive for the pangolin coronavirus of GX_P2V infection.

Discussion
We demonstrated that induced endoderm, ectoderm, hAFECs and hLPCs are
permissive for both SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection. The hESCs are permissive
for GX_P2V but not SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection. Extensive viral protein
expression and infectious viral particles were also detected in these infected cells.
Breastmilk and Remdesivir could inhibit viral infection and replication in these cells.
In addition, heparin could also inhibit both SARS-CoV-2 and GX_P2V infection,
indicating its potential usage as a direct-acting inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 and
GX_P2V infection. These results may explain why SARS-CoV-2 could infect many
organs. Moreover, these results provided insight that these stem cells maybe provided
a stable repository of coronavirus function or genome. Coronavirus persistence in
human stem cells confers the possibility that coronavirus may eventually become a
passenger in the human germline and even vertical transmission to new born.
Surprisingly, the pangolin coronavirus of GX_P2V could not only infect human
mature somatic cells1, but also infect the hESCs, endoderm, ectoderm, hAFECs and
hLPCs, indicating the possibility of the cross-species transmission and potential
danger of coronavirus from animals. However, both viruses could not infect
mesoderm, even though it expresses viral recptor of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, indicating
the potential inhibitory activity of mesoderm to these coronaviruses, which may
explain why mesenchymal stem cells could be used as a therapy tool for COVID-19
treatment15. The potential consequence of SARS-CoV-2 and animal coronavirus such
as GX_P2V infection in hESCs, germ layer and induced progenitors should be closely
monitored.

infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus at viral inocula of 650 TCID50/well with or
without breastmilk (2 mg/ml). Cell were harvest at 24 hpi and luciferase activity was
determined. (B) hLPCs and hAFECs (D) were challenged with 0.1 MOI GX_P2V
combined with Remdsivir (1.5 μM) and human breastmilk (2mg/ml), respectively.
Cells were harvested at 24, 48 and 72 hpi and viral loads were quantified by RT-qPCR.
(E) Representative images of hESCs markers of SSEA4 andOCT-4, endoderm marker
of Sox17, mesoderm marker of Brachyury and ectoderm marker of Nestin. Scale bars,
100 μm. (F) SARS-CoV-2 (650 TCID50/well) infection was performed in hESCs,
endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm and luciferase activity was detected at 24 hpi.
Human breastmilk of human and goat were used to treat SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirurs
infection in endoderm (G) and ectoderm (H). Endoderm (I) and ectoderm (J) were
infected with GX_P2V (MOI 0.1) and treated with Remdesivir (1.5 μM) and viral
loads were determined by RT-qPCR at 24, 48 and 72 hpi. (K) Representative image of
NP of GX_P2V expression in endoderm and endoderm cells. hESCs were challenged
with GX_P2V (MOI 0.1 and 0.01) and viral loads were detected by RT-qPCR at 48
and 72 hpi (L) and by western blot at 72 hpi (M). (N) Infectious virus titer of the
supernatant samples from hESCs, endoderm and ectoderm infected with GX_P2V for
72h were determined by plaque assay. Data were obtained from three independent
experiments. hESCs, human embryonic stem cells; hAFECs, human anterior foregut
endoderm; hLPCs, human lung progenitor cells; MOI, multiplicity of infection; hpi,
hours post-infection; NP, nucleoprotein. Values are shown as mean of triplicates ± SD,
*p<0.05, **p<0.01 by unpaired two-tailed t test.
