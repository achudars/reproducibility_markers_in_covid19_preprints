ABSTRACT

30

The innate immune system efficiently defends the human host against viral pathogens. Thus, viruses

31

evolved strategies to counteract immune activation. Here, we systematically analysed the impact of 29

32

SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins on three major arms of our cell-intrinsic innate immune defences:

33

interferon (IFN) induction, cytokine signalling and autophagy. Subsequent mechanistic analyses

34

revealed that SARS-CoV-2 proteins target the respective signalling cascades at multiple steps. For

35

example, we show that Nsp14 reduces endogenous IFN receptor levels and ORF3a and ORF7a perturb

36

the late endosomal/trans-Golgi network. Our data demonstrates that most antagonistic activities are

37

conserved between proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2, the closely related bat RaTG13-CoV and the

38

highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-1. However, SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15 is strikingly more potent in

39

suppressing IFN induction and signalling than its SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. This may help explain the

40

lower pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2, which facilitated its rapid spread. Overall our analyses revealed

41

that IFN-γ and IFN-λ1 signalling are antagonised the least, leaving SARS-CoV-2 highly susceptible to

42

these two cytokines. Their combination synergistically potentiated the anti-viral effects against SARS-

43

CoV-2 at low concentrations. Taken together, our results allow an explanation for differences in

44

susceptibility towards IFNs and provide evidence that rational immune activation may be an effective

45

future therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2. (200 words)

INTRODUCTION

47

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a zoonotic, novel coronavirus

48

that emerged at the end of 20191–3. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes coronavirus disease 2019

49

(COVID-19)4. The virus rapidly spread all over the world owing to its higher transmission rates 5

50

(R=2.5), as well as a lower morbidity and case fatality rates (CFR 3-4%)6 compared to previous

51

epidemic coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-1 (R=2.0, CFR 11%) or MERS-CoV (R=0.9, CFR 35%)7–9.

52

However, its pathogenicity is still much higher than that of ‘common cold’ CoVs such as HKU1 and

53

229E10

54

(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).

55

Upon infection of a target cell, CoVs are recognised by innate immune sensors, for example via RIG-

56

I-like receptors (RLRs)11, which activate cell-intrinsic innate immune defences (hereafter referred to as

57

the innate immune system)12,1314. However, the exact ligand triggering the response is unknown.

58

Activation of RLRs induces signalling cascades that ultimately lead to the release of IFNs and other

59

pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as induction of anti-viral effectors15. Released cytokines are

60

subsequently also recognised by neighbouring cells and induce an antiviral transcriptional response.

61

Thus, both the infected cell and non-infected neighbouring cells are set in an anti-viral state16,17

62

eventually limiting viral spread. Other branches of the innate immune system, such as autophagy, are

63

activated during CoV infections as well18,19. Autophagy is capable of targeting viral components or even

64

whole viruses for lysosomal degradation20,21 and SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to block autophagic

65

turnover18. Eventually activation of innate immunity recruits and stimulates the adaptive immune

66

system ultimately facilitating elimination of the virus22,23. Notably, inborn defects in innate immunity

67

or auto-antibodies against IFNs are associated with high frequencies of severe COVID-19 cases,

68

suggesting that innate defence mechanisms play a major role in immune control of SARS-CoV-224,25.

69

SARS-CoV-2 infections show higher numbers of subclinical, asymptomatic infections (up to 80% 6)

70

compared to previous epidemic CoVs such as SARS-CoV-110. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that

71

SARS-CoV-2 can be more efficiently antagonised by IFNs than SARS-CoV-1 in vitro26. However, the

72

underlying reasons for differences in IFN susceptibility between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 are

73

currently not fully understood.

74

Recent reports demonstrated that infection with SARS-CoV-2 induces an imbalanced innate immune

75

response, indicating manipulation by SARS-CoV-227,28. Proteomics analysis of selected SARS-CoV-2

76

proteins revealed that innate immune activation is perturbed on multiple levels 27. For example, it was

77

suggested that ORF3a inhibits autophagic turnover, ORF8 alters Integrin-TGFβ-EGFR-RTK

78

signalling27 and ORF3b antagonises type I IFN induction by a yet unknown mechanism29. In addition,

79

the SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1) shuts down cellular translation including the cytokine-

80

mediated innate immune response30. Analysis of the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and IFN-

81

β induction and signalling revealed that at least eight SARS-CoV-2 proteins interfere with type I IFN

82

signalling31,32. Among them is ORF6, which was suggested to interfere with nuclear trafficking of

83

transcription factors thereby impairing gene induction32,33. However, so far only type I IFN signalling

84

was analysed in some detail and our knowledge how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates innate immunity is far

85

from being complete.

86

Currently, treatment with IFNs is explored in clinical trials against SARS-CoV-234. However, patients

87

receiving immunomodulatory therapy with IFNs generally suffer from severe side-effects including

88

psychological symptoms such as depression35–37. Novel strategies which activate the immune system

89

but reduce inflammation and lower doses of cytokines are required38. Thus, analysing how SARS-CoV-

90

2 antagonises innate immunity may give valuable clues on viral vulnerabilities that might be exploited

91

for effective and safe therapeutic immune control.

92

Here, we systematically analysed the impact of 29 SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins29,39,40 on the major

93

branches of the cell-intrinsic innate immune system: IFN induction, IFN/pro-inflammatory cytokine

94

signalling and autophagy. This identified Nsp1, Nsp3, Nsp5, Nsp10, Nsp13, Nsp14, ORF3a, ORF6,

95

ORF7a and ORF7b as the major innate immune antagonists encoded by SARS-CoV-2. Interference

96

with innate immune activation is achieved by using a diverse, synergistic set of mechanisms ranging

97

from downregulation of IFN receptor expression by Nsp14 to blockage of autophagy via fragmentation

98

of the trans-Golgi network by the viral proteins ORF3a and ORF7a. Strikingly, our data indicate that

99

Nsp15 of both RaTG13-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 counteract type I IFN induction and signalling much

100

less efficiently than SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15. Our analyses of SARS-CoV-2 mediated counteraction of IFN

101

signalling revealed that IFN-γ and IFN-λ1 pathways are antagonised the least, and consequently

102

treatment with these two cytokines is most potent against SARS-CoV-2. Combined IFN treatment at

103

very low doses potentiates the individual anti-viral effect and can be further improved by anti-

104

inflammatory autophagy activation. Thus, our results provide a plausible explanation why SARS-CoV-

105

2 is more susceptible against IFN treatment than SARS-CoV-1 and indicate that combination of IFN-γ

106

and IFN-λ1 is an effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 approach.

107

RESULTS

108

A variety of SARS-CoV-2 proteins antagonise innate immune pathways

109

To systematically examine how SARS-CoV-2 manipulates innate immunity, we used Strep II-tagged

110

expression constructs39 coding for 28 of the 30 currently reported SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Nsp1, Nsp2,

111

Nsp4, Nsp5, Nsp6, Nsp7, Nsp8, Nsp9, Nsp10, Nsp11, Nsp12, Nsp13, Nsp14, Nsp15, Nsp16, S, ORF3a,

112

ORF3c, E, M, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF9b, N, ORF9c and ORF10) (Fig. 1a). In addition,

113

we examined untagged Nsp3. Expression of all proteins was confirmed by western blotting

114

(Supplementary Fig. 1a) and immunofluorescence analyses (Supplementary Fig. 1b). The impact of all

115

29 viral proteins on three major branches of innate immunity: IFN/pro-inflammatory cytokine induction

116

via RLRs (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1c), signalling (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 1d) and autophagy

117

(Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 1e) was analysed by quantitative reporter assays.

118

Induction of type I IFNs (IFN-α and IFN-β) was monitored using a Firefly luciferase reporter controlled

119

by the full IFN-α4 promotor, the full IFN-β promoter, or isolated binding sites for the transcription

120

factors IRF3 or NF-κB (Fig. 1b). All assays were normalized for cell viability (Supplementary Fig. 1f).

121

HEK293T cells were infected with Sendai Virus, mimicking RLR activation by SARS-CoV-2. Nsp2,

122

Nsp6 and Nsp12 slightly enhanced both IFN-α4 and IFN-β promoter induction as well as IRF3-

123

dependent transcription (Fig. 1b). However, our analyses revealed that Nsp1, Nsp3, Nsp5, Nsp10,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.15.340612; this version posted October 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this

124

Nsp13, ORF6 and ORF7b are the major SARS-CoV-2 encoded antagonists of type I IFN induction

125

(Fig. 1b).

126

Treatment with type I and III IFNs, such as IFN-α, IFN-β and IFN-λ1 culminates in the induction of

127

genes with IFN response element (ISRE)-containing promoters16. Type II IFN-γ causes gene activation

128

of gamma activated sequence (GAS) containing promoters. Pro-inflammatory cytokine signalling

129

(TNFα and IL-1α) induces genes containing NF-κB sites in the promoter. Signalling of type I IFNs

130

(IFN-α and IFN-β), type II IFN (IFN-γ), type III IFN (IFN-λ1) and pro-inflammatory cytokine

131

signalling (TNFα and IL-1α) was quantified using quantitative Firefly luciferase reporters controlled

132

by the respective promoters (Fig. 1c). Stimulation with IFN-α2 and IFN-β (Fig. 1c) revealed that

133

activation of the ISRE promoter is strongly repressed by Nsp1, Nsp5, Nsp13, Nsp14, ORF6 and ORF7b.

134

A similar set of viral proteins interfered with type II IFN-γ and type III IFN-λ1 signalling, albeit much

135

weaker (mean inhibition 18% and 35%, respectively) compared to type I IFN signalling (mean

136

inhibition 78% for IFN-α2 and 53% for IFN-β). Activation of NF-κB signalling by TNFα or IL-1α was

137

potently inhibited by the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp1, Nsp5, Nsp15, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6 and ORF7b proteins.

138

These analyses revealed that a similar set of proteins (Nsp1, Nsp5, Nsp15, ORF3a, E, M, ORF6 and

139

ORF7b) antagonises pro-inflammatory cytokine induction and signalling.

140

Since induction of autophagy does not depend on de novo gene expression41, we monitored autophagy

141

levels in SARS-CoV-2 protein expressing HEK293T cells by membrane-association of stably expressed

142

GFP-LC3B, a hallmark of autophagy induction (Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 1e)42. Autophagosome

143

numbers under basal conditions were strongly increased in the presence of ORF3a, E, M and ORF7a,

144

suggesting either de novo induction of autophagy or blockage of turnover (Fig. 1d). Upon induction of

145

autophagy using Rapamycin, a similar pattern was observed. To clarify whether these viral proteins

146

induce autophagy or block turnover, leading to accumulation of GFP-LC3B positive vesicles, we treated

147

cells with saturating amounts of Bafilomycin A1, which inhibits autophagic turnover. The increase of

148

autophagosome numbers by ORF3a, E, M and ORF7a was drastically reduced compared to non-

149

blocking conditions (Fig. 1d), indicating that these proteins block turnover, rather than induce it.

150

Blockage of autophagy and co-expression of Nsp1 and Nsp14 induced cell death, which may be

151

responsible for the low number of autophagosomes. Unexpectedly, in the presence of Nsp15

152

autophagosome numbers were consistently reduced, suggesting that it inhibits autophagy (Fig. 1d).

153

Taken together, our analysis reveals that SARS-CoV-2 encodes multiple proteins that strongly

154

antagonise innate immunity. Notably, there are differences in overall inhibition of the pathways with

155

IFN-γ and IFN-λ1 signalling being only weakly antagonised. Furthermore, autophagy turnover is

156

strongly blocked by E, M, ORF3a and ORF7a, thus autophagic degradation is avoided.

157

SARS-CoV-2 proteins target innate immunity at multiple levels

158

Our analyses revealed that IFN-β signalling as well as autophagy are strongly counteracted by multiple

159

SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Therefore, we aimed at identifying the steps that are targeted in these pathways.

160

We focused on the top 5 inhibitors as identified in Fig. 1b-d. Nsp1 was removed from the analysis as it

161

prevents translation in general30. To analyse IFN-β signalling, we monitored the levels of the type I IFN

162

receptor, IFNAR using western blotting in HEK293T cells overexpressing Nsp5, Nsp13, Nsp14, ORF6

163

or ORF7b. Activation of the two major transcription factors of type I IFN signalling, STAT1 and

164

STAT2 (Fig. 2a), was examined by phosphorylation status. Basal STAT1 and STAT2 levels were not

165

significantly affected by all proteins tested (Fig. 2b, quantification in Supplementary Fig. 2a-c). (Fig.

166

2b). In the presence of Nsp5, activated STAT1 and to a lesser extent STAT2 accumulated (Fig. 2b and

167

2d, Supplementary Fig. 2a). ORF6 and ORF7b neither affect IFNAR levels nor STAT1 expression nor

168

activation (Fig. 2b-d). This agrees with recent reports26,43,44 suggesting that ORF6 instead prevents

169

trafficking of transcription factors. In the presence of Nsp14 and to a lesser extent Nsp13, endogenous

170

levels of IFNAR were prominently reduced (Fig. 2b, c). Consequently, phosphorylation of STAT1 was

171

decreased upon Nsp14 co-expression (Fig. 2b, d).

172

Upon activation of autophagy, cytoplasmic MAP1LC3B (LC3B) is proteolytically processed and

173

lipidated (LC3B-II) to decorate autophagosomal membranes41,42. Upon fusion of autophagosomes with

174

lysosomes, the autophagic receptor p62 is degraded (autophagy turnover, Fig. 2e). We analysed the

175

effect of the top 5 autophagy modulating SARS-CoV-2 proteins: Nsp15, ORF3a, E, M and ORF7a (Fig.

176

1d) on autophagy markers. Levels of Beclin-1 and ULK1, which are part of the core machinery of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.15.340612; this version posted October 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this

177

autophagy initiation45,46, remained constant (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. 2d and 2e). Overexpression of

178

Nsp15 led to a very slight decrease of LC3B-II but accumulation of p62, suggesting that Nsp15 blocks

179

induction of autophagy (Fig. 2f and 2g-h). In line with this, the number of GFP-LC3B-puncta

180

(=autophagosomes) per cell in HeLa-GFP-LC3B cells was reduced upon Nsp15 expression to almost 0

181

(Fig. 2i, j). In the presence of ORF3a, E and ORF7a, the levels of processed LC3B (LC3B-II) were 4-

182

to 7-fold increased (Fig. 2g), and p62 levels were approximately 1.5-fold increased (Fig. 2h). This

183

indicates that these three viral proteins block autophagic turnover. Consequently, the number of

184

autophagosomes was 10-fold increased upon ORF3a, E, M or ORF7a expression (Fig. 2i, j). Curiously,

185

while accumulation of LC3B-II indicated that M blocks autophagic turnover or induces autophagy, the

186

levels of p62 were not significantly altered in the presence of M (Fig. 2f, h). Notably, overexpression

187

of M resulted in an accumulation of LC3B in the perinuclear space, whereas for all other viral proteins

188

autophagosomes were normally distributed (Fig. 2i, j).

189

Taken together, our data demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 synergistically targets innate immune

190

activation. The major type I IFN antagonists Nsp5, Nsp13, Nsp14, ORF6 and ORF7b block the

191

signalling cascade at different levels. E, ORF3a and ORF7a use similar mechanism to block autophagic

192

turnover, while M may have evolved a different mechanism and Nsp15 inhibits de novo autophagy

193

induction.

194

ORF3a and ORF7a perturb the late-endosomal/trans-Golgi network

195

Our data showed that ORF3a and ORF7a are potent autophagy antagonists of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1d,

196

Fig. 2f-j). To determine their molecular mechanism(s), we performed proteome analysis of HEK293T

197

cells overexpressing SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a and ORF7a (Supplementary Fig. 3a). As a control, we used

198

S, Nsp1 and Nsp16 overexpressing cells which show little to no effect on autophagy (Fig. 1d). In

199

addition, we analysed the proteome of Caco-2 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 for 24 or 48 h. Fold

200

changes compared to vector transfected or non-infected controls were calculated (Fig. 3a, b,

201

Supplementary Fig. 3b-e, Supplementary Table 1). Analysis of the data revealed that in the presence of

202

Nsp1, cellular proteins with a short half-life were markedly reduced (Supplementary Fig. 3f)47. This

203

supports our previous finding that Nsp1 globally blocks translation30 and confirms the validity of the

204

proteome analysis. PANTHER-assisted Gene Ontology Analysis of the proteins regulated more than 4-

205

fold by the overexpression of individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins revealed that ORF3a and ORF7a target

206

the late endosome pathway (GO:0005770) (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Table 2). A similar analysis for the

207

SARS-CoV-2 samples showed that the late endosome pathway is also affected during the genuine

208

infection. Thus, we had a closer look at the subcellular localisation of ORF3a and ORF7a and their

209

effect on intracellular vesicles. In line with the proteome analysis, ORF7a and ORF3a both localised to

210

the late endosomal compartment, co-localising with the marker Rab9 (Fig. 3d, e). In contrast,

211

localisation to Rab5a-positive early endosomes was not apparent (Supplementary Fig. 3g). Disturbance

212

of the integrity of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) at the interface with the late endosomes48,49 by viral

213

proteins is a well-known strategy to block autophagy50. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the

214

localisation of ORF3a or ORF7a partially overlapped with a TGN marker (R = 0.5, Fig. 3g) indicating

215

close proximity. ORF6, which is known to localise to the Golgi apparatus43, was used a positive control

216

(R=0.7). Nsp8, which displayed a cytoplasmic localisation, was used as a negative control (R=0.3).

217

Importantly, analysis of free TGN-marker positive vesicles in SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a or ORF7a

218

expressing cells revealed that both viral proteins cause significant fragmentation of the TGN (Fig. 3f,

219

h).

220

These data indicate that both ORF3a and ORF7a disturb the proteome at the late endosomes eventually

221

causing the TGN to fragment, which ultimately leads to a block of autophagic turnover49–52.

222

SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 is less potent in innate immune antagonism than SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15

223

To examine the conservation of innate immune antagonism, we functionally compared Nsp1, Nsp3,

224

Nsp7, Nsp15, M, N, ORF3a, ORF6 and ORF7a of SARS-CoV-2, the closest related CoV, RaTG13-

225

CoV and the previous highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-1. RaTG13-CoV was isolated from the

226

intermediate host horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus affinis)3. The amino acid sequences of the different

227

CoVs are largely conserved, with the exception of Nsp3, ORF3a and ORF6 (Fig. 4a), and were all

228

expressed as confirmed by western blotting (Supplementary Fig. 4a-i). Rabies virus P protein53–55,

229

Measles virus V protein56–58 and TRIM3259,60 expression served as positive controls. Overall, proteins

230

of SARS-CoV-1 and RaTG13-CoV behave similar to their SARS-CoV-2 counterparts, suggesting that

231

many functions are conserved. Importantly, however, this is not the case for Nsp15, Nsp3 and to a lesser

232

extend ORF6 (Fig. 4a-c). SARS-CoV-1 ORF6 is about 4-fold less potent in antagonising type I IFN

233

signalling (Fig. 4b) but induces higher levels of autophagy (Fig. 4c). However, expression levels of

234

SARS-CoV-1 ORF6 were also higher than that of its SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13-CoV counterparts

235

(Supplementary Fig. 4g), which may explain the differences in activity. Significant differences between

236

SARS-CoV, RaTG13-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3 were reanalysed in a dose-dependent manner,

237

however the differences are only in the range of 2-3-fold (Supplementary Fig. 4j).

238

The most striking, statistically significant difference was observed for Nsp15. SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15 is

239

over 10-fold more potent in suppression of type I IFN induction and signalling than RaTG13-CoV and

240

SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15 (Fig. 4a, b). Notably, expression levels of SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13-CoV and

241

SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15 were similar, with SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15 even slightly less expressed

242

(Supplementary Fig. 4c). Notably, all Nsp15 variants still inhibited autophagy equally (Fig. 4c).

243

Analysis of the dose-dependent effect of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15, RaTG13-CoV Nsp15 and SARS-CoV-

244

1 Nsp15 on type I IFN induction (Fig. 4d) and signalling (Fig. 4e) showed that on average SARS-CoV-

245

2 Nsp15 performed 32-fold worse than SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15, and RaTG13-CoV Nsp15 inhibited type

246

I IFN induction 7.8-fold less (Fig. 4d). Similarly, SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15 outperformed RaTG13-CoV and

247

SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 by 15- and 5.7-fold, respectively, in inhibition of type I IFN signalling (Fig. 4e).

248

Taken together, this data indicates, that while most IFN antagonist activities are conserved between

249

SARS-CoV-1, RaTG13-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, there is a major exception: Nsp15 of SARS-CoV-2

250

was considerably less potent than SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15 in counteracting both IFN-β induction and

251

signalling.

252

Inefficient antagonism by SARS-CoV-2 proteins is predictive for efficient immune control

253

Our analyses revealed that several of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins synergistically antagonise innate

254

immune activation (Figs. 1-4), albeit with different efficiency. The mean inhibition of IFN-γ and IFN-

255

λ1 signalling was only 18% and 35%, respectively, compared to type I IFN signalling with a mean

256

inhibition of 78% for IFN-α2 and 53% for IFN-β. Consequently, we assessed whether IFN-α2, IFN-β,

257

IFN-γ and IFN-λ1 have a different impact on SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Fig. 5a, b).

258

Treatment with the type I IFN-α2 was the least efficient. In contrast, at the same concentration IFN-γ

259

(500 U/ml) reduced viral RNA in the supernatant almost 300-fold more efficiently. All agents caused

260

little if any cytotoxic effects (Supplementary Fig. 5c). Altogether, we observed a good correlation (r=

261

0.89) between average inhibition of the respective signalling pathway (Fig. 1c) antagonised by the 29

262

SARS-CoV-2 proteins and IFN susceptibility at 5 U/ml (Fig. 5b). Thus, our results indicate that the

263

overall efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in counteracting specific IFN signalling pathway is

264

predictive for the overall antiviral potency of different types of IFNs.

265

Rational combination allows highly effective innate control of SARS-CoV-2

266

IFN therapy is commonly associated with significant adverse effects, due to inflammation. To minimize

267

detrimental pro-inflammatory effects of IFNs, doses required for efficient viral restriction should be

268

reduced. Thus, we analysed the impact of the most potent IFNs, IFN-γ and IFN-λ1, and their

269

combination on SARS-CoV-2 replication. To mimic prophylactic and therapeutic treatment, we

270

examined pre-treatment for 24 h before infection with SARS-CoV-2 and treatment 6 h post-infection.

271

Overall, the effects of IFN treatment were about 10-fold stronger in the prophylactic condition than in

272

the therapeutic treatment but consistent (Fig. 5c, d). Expression analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S and N

273

confirmed the qPCR results, and equal GAPDH levels show no cytotoxicity (Fig. 5d). While treatment

274

with a single dose of IFN-γ and IFN-λ1 alone reduced viral RNA production 50-100-fold, the

275

combinatorial treatment at the same concentration synergistically potentiated the effect to about 1000-

276

fold reduction in SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Fig. 5c).

277

To further decrease inflammatory side-effects by IFN treatment, anti-inflammatory pathways like

278

autophagy could be induced61–63. Treatment with Rapamycin, which induces autophagy, already

279

reduced viral replication to a maximum of 4-6-fold on its own at 125 nM (Supplementary Fig. 5d, e).

280

Bafilomycin A1, which blocks autophagy, had little to no effects. Both drugs only marginally affected

281

cell survival at the used concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 5f). Treatment of Rapamycin (125 nM) in

282

combination with either IFN-γ or IFN-λ1 was found to be additive (Fig. 5c, d). Triple treatment with

283

IFN-γ, IFN-λ1 and Rapamycin showed the most potent anti-viral effect of all combinations for pre-

284

treatment and post-treatment, reducing viral RNA in the supernatant by ~2100-fold and ~86-fold,

285

respectively (Fig. 5c).

286

In summary, our data shows that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect of combinatorial treatments of IFN-γ,

287

IFN-λ1 are synergistic. Additional anti-inflammatory autophagy activation by Rapamycin even further

288

decreased SARS-CoV-2 replication. This suggests that concerted activation of innate immunity may be

289

an effective anti-viral approach ensuring low inflammation.

290

DISCUSSION

291

Viruses drastically alter our innate immune defences to establish an infection and propagate to the next

292

host13,14,21,27,43,64. Our data reveal the extent of immune manipulation SARS-CoV-2 employs. We

293

determined the major antagonists of type I, type II and type III IFN induction and signalling as well as

294

pro-inflammatory NF-κB activity encoded by SARS-CoV-2 (Nsp1, Nsp5, Nsp13, Nsp14, ORF6 and

295

ORF7b). In addition, autophagy is majorly targeted by Nsp15, ORF3a, E, M and ORF7a. Subsequent

296

mechanistic studies revealed that SARS-CoV-2 proteins synergistically block innate immune induction

297

at various levels. We could reveal for the first time, that Nsp14 lowers the cellular levels of the IFN

298

receptor, IFNAR, consequently preventing activation of the crucial transcription factors STAT1 and

299

STAT2. Both ORF3a and ORF7a cause fragmentation of the TGN via disturbing the late endosomal

300

pathway. This is a common strategy of viruses to block autophagic turnover50. Examination of the

301

functional conservation showed that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 was less efficient in blocking innate immune

302

activation, both type I IFN induction and signalling, than SARS-CoV-1 Nsp15. This may ultimately

303

cause SARS-CoV-2 to be better controlled by the innate immune system than SARS-CoV, impacting

304

the number of subclinical infections and eventually facilitate efficient spread. Thus, our data suggests

305

that differences in innate immune antagonism by Nsp15 could have contributed to the rapid spread of

306

SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the combined analysis of IFN antagonism allowed us to deduce that treatment

307

with IFN-γ and IFN-λ1 is most efficient against SARS-CoV-2. On top of that, combinatorial treatment

308

of SARS-CoV-2 with these two IFNs and anti-inflammatory autophagy induction potentiated the effects

309

of the individual treatments. This may pave the way for future anti-viral therapies against SARS-CoV-

310

2 based on rational immune activation.

311

Why would multiple effective proteins target the same pathway? For example, type I IFN signalling

312

could have been shut down by Nsp1, Nsp5, Nsp13, Nsp14, ORF6 and ORF7b alone, each reducing the

313

activation of the innate immune pathways to below 10%. However, our assays revealed (Figs. 1-3) that

314

the targeting mechanisms are often not redundant and may act synergistically. This could allow the

315

virus to better control the targeted pathway, thus minimising the effect of the signalling on its

316

replication. In addition, a viral protein majorly targeting one pathway may affect other connected

317

immune pathways at once. For example, disturbance of the kinase TBK1 activation may affect primarily

318

IFN induction and to a lesser extend also impact autophagy65. Proteome analyses revealed the late

319

endosome/Golgi network as a target of ORF3a and ORF7a. Our data suggests, that both ORF3a and

320

ORF7a of SARS-CoV-2 cause fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus and thus likely blockage of

321

autophagy. SARS-CoV-1 ORF3a was previously implicated in Golgi fragmentation51,66. Notably,

322

fragmentation of the Golgi is for example triggered by Hepatitis C virus to block anti-viral autophagic

323

turnover50 and may represent a common strategy by viruses to avoid autophagic degradation. Based on

324

our initial proteome approaches, future studies will see more mechanistic data to explain the molecular

325

details of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 proteins on innate immune activation. Notably, several proteins

326

including ORF6, ORF3a, ORF7a, M and E, accumulate at the Golgi network or in perinuclear spaces,

327

alluding to the emerging role of the Golgi as a hub for immune manipulation52,67.

328

Our results demonstrate that ORF6, ORF3a, ORF7a and ORF7b are the strongest innate immune

329

antagonists among the accessory genes of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 1). Besides the accessory genes, which

330

classically encode immune antagonists, a surprising number of non-structural proteins manipulate

331

innate immunity. Nsp1, which targets cellular translation and thus broadly inhibits any response

332

dependent on cellular translation, including IFN induction and expression of ISGs30. However, Nsp3,

333

Nsp5, Nsp13 and to a lower extend Nsp15 also antagonised IFN induction and signalling (Fig. 1). These

334

non-structural proteins of CoVs have important functions in the viral life-cycle: Nsp3 as ISG/ubiquitin

335

ligase and protease for autocatalytic processing of the ORF1a/b precursor protein68–70 Nsp5 as a protease

336

mediating cleavage of the precursor polyproteins71,72, Nsp13 as NTPase/Helicase73,74 and Nsp15 as

337

endoribonuclease75. So far it is not completely clear how their enzymatic functions may impact their

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.15.340612; this version posted October 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this

338

activity against innate immunity. Except for Nsp3, as its function as a de-ISGlase may inactivate the

339

transcription factor IRF3 and thus reduce IFN induction70. According to our analysis the structural

340

proteins E and M strongly manipulated autophagy (Fig. 1d). This suggests that the incoming virion may

341

already block autophagic turnover to prevent their own degradation by autophagy.

342

However, while we may detect most counteraction strategies, our screening approach may miss immune

343

evasion strategies employed by SARS-CoV-2. For example, many non-structural proteins form

344

complexes, that are not preent during single overexpression and may only be functional as a full

345

assembly. Evasion mechanisms based on RNA structures and sequences will not be identified due to

346

the usage of codon-optimized expression plasmids. Finally, the virus itself may employ strategies to

347

hide itself from recognition, not activating innate immune defences in the first place. One example is

348

the capping of its genomic and subgenomic mRNAs, which removes the free triphosphate 5’end.

349

Our analyses further revealed that the human innate immune antagonism is largely conserved in an

350

animal CoV isolate that is sequentially closest related to SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13-CoV1,76 (Fig. 4). This

351

indicates that the virus from horseshoe bats is capable of counteracting the human immune defences,

352

which may have facilitated successful zoonotic transmission from bats eventually to humans. Currently,

353

the intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2 is under debate3,76–78, however it is likely, that the virus

354

isolated from it is even closer related to SARS-CoV-2 than RATG13-CoV. Thus, any immune evasion

355

mechanisms conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13-CoV, is likely to be conserved in the direct

356

progenitor virus of SARS-CoV-2. The previous epidemic and related human SARS-CoV-1 and the

357

current pandemic SARS-CoV-2 differ in susceptibility towards IFNs with SARS-CoV-1 being more

358

resistant26. Furthermore, infection with SARS-CoV-2 is often asymptomatic and likely controlled by

359

the host26 as lower mortality rates and higher subclinical infections suggest4. Paradoxically, this may

360

support the fast spread and ‘success’ of the virus. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 may have found the ‘perfect’

361

balance. Intermediate immune evasion and consequently intermediate pathogenicity to support spread,

362

but not kill the host. Our data shows that SARS-CoV-2 Nsp15 is strikingly less in efficient in IFN

363

evasion than Nsp15 of SARS-CoV. These data are the first mechanistic evidence why SARS-CoV-1 is

364

less susceptible towards IFN treatment than SARS-CoV-2. It may be tempting to speculate that common

365

cold CoVs counteract the innate immune system less efficiently than SARS-CoV-2.

366

Our analysis indicates that during a SARS-CoV-2 infection less cytokines than expected are released,

367

autophagic turnover is blocked and general immune activation is perturbed. This is supported by a large

368

amount of data from COVID19 patients24–28,43,70,79–81. However, an important question remains: Why

369

are some innate immune pathways, such as IFN-γ signalling less antagonised (Fig. 1)? Are the viral

370

immune manipulation strategies ineffective? Indeed, IFN-γ is the most potent IFN against SARS-CoV-

371

2 we and others tested80 (Fig. 5). One possible explanation would be that there was no need for the virus

372

to antagonise them. Indeed, in COVID19 patients and in vitro infections with SARS-CoV-2, IFN-γ

373

levels are surprisingly low28,81. Furthermore, despite high IFN-γ levels being a hallmark of cytokine

374

storms induced by influenza viruses, the SARS-CoV-2 cytokine storm only has low IFN-γ levels and

375

decreased IFN-γ expression in CD4+ T cells is associated with severe COVID194,82,83. It is tempting to

376

speculate that T-cells which confer pre-existing immunity against SARS-CoV-284,85 could, upon

377

activation, release IFN-γ, whose innate immune signalling may also contribute to increased clearance

378

of the infection. Strikingly, our work shows that analysis of the innate antagonism may be predictive

379

for therapeutic opportunities.

380

Severe side effects due to high and constant inflammation are prevalent for treatments with IFNs35–37.

381

However, theses side-effects are dose-dependent86. Thus, minimizing the dose required for treatment is

382

paramount. Our data indicates that effects of treatment with multiple IFNs is additive but synergistic

383

and potentiates each other (Fig. 5). Therefore, a promising anti-viral approach may be a combinatorial

384

treatment of different cytokines, effectively also reducing the burden of side-effects. The side effects of

385

IFN therapy are mainly caused by inflammation. Combined with anti-inflammatory approaches such as

386

autophagy activation by Rapamycin62,63, this approach may even be more successful, as our in vitro data

387

suggests. Future studies are highly warranted to study rational, concerted innate immune activation

388

against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. These studies may eventually pave the way for novel therapies, which

389

may not only work against SARS-CoV-2, but also against other pathogenic viruses, including

390

potentially future CoVs.

391

In summary, our results reveal the extend of innate immune manipulation of SARS-CoV-2. The

392

comparison of innate antagonism of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-CoV-1 revealed that mutations in Nsp15

393

may be responsible for the higher susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 against IFNs. Finally, our data allowed

394

us to deduce the most effective IFNs against SARS-CoV-2 and combinatorial treatments even further

395

minimized the doses of the individual cytokines required.

565

post-transfection, cells were harvested in PBS and treated for 20 min at 4 °C with PBS

566

containing 0.05% Saponin. Non-membrane bound GFP-LC3B was washed out of the

567

permeabilized cells using PBS (Gibco) twice, followed by fixation in 4% Paraformaldehyde

568

(PFA, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The fluorescence intensity of membrane associated GFP-

569

groups: I. enriched in NSP1+: log2(fc) > 2, II. enriched in Vector: log2(fc) < -2, III. Not

698

enriched: -2 <= log2(fc) <= 2. The proteins for which data on the half lives in hepatocytes47

699

were extracted and plotted by scaling their mean half-lives corresponding to the proteins in

700

each group to the interval [0-1] using min-max normalization and generated boxplots for each

701

of them. We used MATLAB 2019b for the half-life analysis.

702
703

Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad PRISM 8 (GraphPad

704

Software). P-values were determined using a two-tailed Student’s t test with Welch’s

705

correction. Unless otherwise stated, data are shown as the mean of at least three biological

706

replicates ± SEM. Significant differences are indicated as: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p <

707

0.001. Statistical parameters are specified in the figure legends.
