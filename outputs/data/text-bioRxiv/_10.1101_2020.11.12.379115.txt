ABSTRACT

Neutrophil overstimulation plays a crucial role in tissue damage during severe
infections. Neuraminidase (NEU)-mediated cleavage of surface sialic acid has been
demonstrated to regulate leukocyte responses. Here, we report that antiviral NEU
inhibitors constrain host NEU activity, surface sialic acid release, ROS production, and
NETs released by microbial-activated human neutrophils. In vivo, treatment with
Oseltamivir results in infection control and host survival in peritonitis and pneumonia
models of sepsis. Single-cell RNA sequencing re-analysis of publicly data sets of
respiratory tract samples from critical COVID-19 patients revealed an overexpression of
NEU1 in infiltrated neutrophils. Moreover, Oseltamivir or Zanamivir treatment of whole
blood cells from severe COVID-19 patients reduces host NEU-mediated shedding of
cell surface sialic acid and neutrophil overactivation. These findings suggest that
neuraminidase inhibitors can serve as host-directed interventions to dampen neutrophil
dysfunction in severe infections.

INTRODUCTION

Neutrophils are key components of the immune response against multiple pathogens1.
However, during severe acute infections, such as sepsis and COVID-19, overactivated
neutrophils infiltrate vital organs and release many molecules including proteases,
reactive oxygen species (ROS), and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)2,3. While such
inflammatory mediators are essential to the control of infection, they can also damage
healthy cells4. Therefore, the function of neutrophils must be regulated to efficiently
clear microorganisms with minimal detrimental effects to the host.

A number of mechanisms controlling neutrophil activation have been described5. For
instance, the contents of sialic acid (Sia) have been demonstrated to regulate leukocyte
activation to microbial stimuli6,7. The dense array of Sia present in the glycocalyx of all
mammalian cells makes this monosaccharide a central molecule for many cellular
processes including: cell-cell interactions, signal transduction, and transendothelial
migration8. Neuraminidases (NEUs) are enzymes found in both pathogens and
mammalian hosts9, which hydrolyze Sia residues linked to galactose, Nacetylgalactosamine or polySia residues on glycoconjugates, thereby regulating many
physiological and pathological responses10. In human neutrophils, shedding of surface
Sia by microbial-derived NEUs leads to cellular activation, ROS production, and release
of NETs7,11–13. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that LPS induces membraneassociated NEU activation in murine or human macrophages and dendritic cells14. Upon
LPS binding to TLR4, NEU activity was shown to regulate NF-κB induction in

macrophages, suggesting a role for this enzyme during cellular activation14. Also, in
Gram-negative experimental sepsis, leukocyte dysfunction is mediated by NEU activity.
It is associated with an exacerbated inflammatory response and high mortality rates15,16.
As previous studies have demonstrated that pathogen-derived NEU stimulate
neutrophils7,11,17, we investigated whether endogenous host NEUs can be targeted to
regulate neutrophil dysfunction observed in severe infections.

Here, we have identified host NEU activation as a positive regulator of microbialinduced human neutrophil overactivation. Additionally, we have employed antiviral NEU
inhibitors, Oseltamivir and Zanamivir, to explore this pathway and found that these
drugs fine-tune the neutrophil dysfunction observed in sepsis and COVID-19. Together,
our results show that NEU is a potential target for the control of neutrophil dysfunction
and present Oseltamivir or Zanamivir as adjunctive therapy for severe infections.

RESULTS

LPS-induced surface Sia shedding in human neutrophils is mediated by NEU
activity

As activated NEUs hydrolyze Sia residues linked to underlying galactose
glycoconjugates8, we employed a flow cytometry-based lectin binding assay to measure
Sia levels on neutrophils after their activation. a2-3-Sia is a major functional Sia linkage
of surface glycans present on human neutrophils18. Therefore, we used the lectin MAL-II
that binds selectively to a2-3- over a2-6-linked Sia19. LPS treatment of whole blood from
healthy donors significantly reduces the binding of MAL-II on neutrophils (CD66b+)
when compared to untreated cells (Supplementary Fig. 2A). Next, cells were stained
with an Fc-chimera of Siglec-9, a sialic acid-binding protein that recognize Sia in a2-3
and a2-6 linkages20. Similarly, we observed that binding of Siglec-9-Fc (Supplementary
Fig. 2B) is decreased on neutrophils treated with LPS, confirming a reduction of
neutrophil Sia residues likely due to LPS-induced NEU activity in these cells. To test this
hypothesis, we measured NEU activity in human leukocytes using the NEU substrate 4MU-NANA14 and validated the assay using NEU purified from C. perfringens (CpNEU)
(Fig. 1A-B). Both clinically available NEU inhibitors Oseltamivir and Zanamivir reduce
CpNEU activity (Fig. 1A-B). Using total leukocytes from healthy donors, we observed
that LPS-induced NEU activity was significantly inhibited by Oseltamivir or Zanamivir
(Fig. 1C-D). Moreover, these NEU inhibitors prevent LPS- or CpNEU-mediated
reduction of MAL-II binding on neutrophils surface (Fig. 1E-H). Together, these results

show that LPS-induced host NEU activity decreases Sia content on neutrophils, which
can be inhibited by Oseltamivir and Zanamivir.

LPS-induced phagocytosis and killing of E. coli is modulated by NEU activity

Bacteria uptake and killing are important functions of neutrophils4. We next investigated
whether host NEU regulates phagocytosis and killing of E. coli. Whole blood or total
leukocytes from healthy donors were preincubated with LPS or CpNEU, respectively,
and E. coli BioParticles® added to cells for 60 min. Ingested pHrodo E. coli by
neutrophils were analyzed by flow cytometry. A significant increase in the MFI of
unstimulated cells incubated with pHrodo E. coli was observed at 37 oC compared to
cells at 4 oC, demonstrating robust uptake of the particles (Supplementary Fig. 3). LPS
(Fig. 2A-C) or CpNEU, used as a positive control of NEU effects (Fig. 2D-F), but not
heat-inactivated CpNEU, significantly enhances phagocytosis of E. coli. Remarkably,
these effects are inhibited by Zanamivir or Oseltamivir (Fig. 2A-F), suggesting that LPSenhanced phagocytosis involves a host NEU-dependent pathway. Similarly,
pretreatment of cells with LPS or CpNEU increases both the number of cells with
bacteria as well as the number of bacteria per cell (Fig. 2G-J). These effects were also
abolished when NEU inhibitors Oseltamivir and Zanamivir were added in the cell
cultures (Fig. 2G-J). Furthermore, LPS or CpNEU treatment enhances intracellular and
extracellular killing of E. coli, which are also inhibited by Oseltamivir or Zanamivir (Fig.
2K-L). These results suggest that NEU plays a critical role in LPS-upregulated
phagocytosis and killing responses of neutrophils.

NEU blockade prevents neutrophil activation
Shedding of cell surface Sia by mobilization of granule-associated NEU to the cell
surface has been associated with neutrophil activation21. Therefore, we analyzed
surface expression of CD66b and CD62L, two markers of human neutrophil activation22–
24

, and a2-3-Sia levels in LPS-exposed whole blood cultures. Both Oseltamivir and

Zanamivir inhibit LPS-induced shedding of a2-3-Sia (Fig. 3A,B) and CD62L (Fig. 3D,E)
or upregulation of CD66b (Fig. 3G,H) on neutrophils. Similarly, MAL-II preincubation,
which prevents hydrolysis of a2-3-Sia by NEU by steric hindrance at the NEU cleavage
site25, blocks LPS-induced neutrophil activation (Fig. 3C,F,I). These data show that
dampening NEU activity or blocking the hydrolysis of a2-3-Sia is sufficient to inhibit
human neutrophil activation by LPS. Similar results were observed in soluble CpNEUtreated leukocytes (Supplementary Fig. 4). Next, we assessed whether NEU inhibitors
influenced LPS-stimulated ROS production and release of NETs, key mediators of
bacterial killing and tissue injury26. We observed that neutrophils primed with LPS and
stimulated with PMA produce higher amounts of ROS when compared to unprimed cells
(Fig. 3J-L). Both Oseltamivir and Zanamivir inhibit ROS release to levels similar to
unprimed cells. These results were also reproduced by the treatment of cells with
CpNEU (Supplementary Fig. 5E-G). Furthermore, Oseltamivir or Zanamivir
significantly inhibit LPS-induced NETs released by isolated neutrophils (Fig. 3M).
Together, these data indicate that microbial-induced host NEU activity regulates
important neutrophil functions in vitro.

Oseltamivir enhances survival rate of mice in clinically relevant models of sepsis
Exacerbated neutrophil responses such as increased ROS production, release of NET
and degranulation are associated with tissue injury and organ dysfunction27. By using
Oseltamivir as a therapeutic tool, we next explored the involvement of NEU activity in
vivo during experimental sepsis, a model of neutrophil dysfunction3,28,29. We first
induced sepsis by intraperitoneal administration of 1 x 107 CFU/mice of the Gramnegative E. coli (ATCC 25922), which lacks NEU in its genome30. We used a dose of 10
mg/Kg of Oseltamivir by oral gavage (PO), which is the equivalent dose used in humans
(~7.5 mg/Kg)31. Oseltamivir pretreatment (2 hr before infection) plus post-treatment (6
hr after infection, 12/12 h, PO, for 4 days) markedly boost host survival
(Supplementary Fig. 6A). Only a single dose of Oseltamivir 2 hr before bacterial
administration was sufficient to reduce disease pathology. Oseltamivir significantly
decreases the number of neutrophils in the BAL and lung tissue 4 or 6 hr after infection
(Supplementary Fig. 6B-C). This pretreatment also augments neutrophil migration to
the focus of infection, which is associated with an efficient control of infection
(Supplementary Fig. 6D-F). Furthermore, pretreatment with Oseltamivir decreases
BAL and plasma TNF and IL-17 levels (Supplementary Fig. 6G-J) and tissue injury
markers (AST, ALT, ALP and total bilirubin) (Supplementary Fig. 6K-N), as well as
prevents reduction of a2-3-Sia on peritoneal lavage SSChigh/GR-1high cells
(Supplementary Fig. 6O-P). More importantly, the post-treatment efficacy of
Oseltamivir was also evaluated in survival of septic mice. Mice were IP challenged
with E. coli (1 x 107 CFU/mice) and treated 6 hr after infection with Oseltamivir for 4
days (10 mg/Kg, PO, 12/12h). Strikingly, in the post-treatment protocol, Oseltamivir

provides a significant improvement in the survival rate of septic mice (Supplementary
Fig. 6Q).

Next, we employed the CLP model to evaluate the effect of Oseltamivir in septic mice,
as it is considered the gold standard in preclinical sepsis32. Six hours after CLP, mice
were treated with Oseltamivir for 4 days (10 mg/Kg, PO, 12/12h). This treatment leads
to a small delay in the mortality rate of severe septic mice (Supplementary Fig. 7A).
Next, CLP septic mice were treated with antibiotics because it is one of the standard
interventions used in clinical settings of sepsis33. Importantly, compared to the control
animals, therapeutic use of Oseltamivir plus antibiotics drastically improved survival
rates of CLP mice (87.5% experimental group vs 25% control group) (Supplementary
Fig. 7B). Forty-eight hr after surgery, post-treated septic mice have a significant
reduction of neutrophils in BAL and lungs, improvement of neutrophil migration at the
focus of infection, and reduced bacterial load in PL and blood (Supplementary Fig. 7CG). Levels of TNF and IL-17 in PL and plasma and tissue injury markers were also
reduced in Oseltamivir treated mice (Supplementary Fig. 7H-O). Additionally,
Oseltamivir also leads to a higher expression of a2-3-Sia on SSChigh/GR-1high cells in PL
(Supplementary Fig. 7P-Q) confirming blockade of NEU activity in vivo.

As respiratory tract infections, particularly pneumonia, are among the most common
sites of infection in sepsis34, we intratracheally administered K. pneumoniae (ATCC
700603) into mice to address the effect of Oseltamivir. Post-treatment of mice with
Oseltamivir significantly improves survival of septic mice challenged with K.

pneumoniae (Fig. 4A). The increased host survival was accompanied by a decrease of
neutrophil migration in BAL, reduced levels of TNF and IL-17 and reduced levels of
tissue injury markers (Fig. 4B-K). Oseltamivir also prevents reduction of a2-3-Sia on
BAL SSChigh/GR-1high cells (Fig. 4L-M). Together, these results show that host NEU
activation exacerbates inflammatory responses during sepsis and the use of Oseltamivir
improves disease outcome.

Oseltamivir and Zanamivir rescue overactivated neutrophils from COVID-19
patients

Similar to bacterial sepsis, recent evidence suggests that neutrophils fuel hyperinflammatory response during severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Larger numbers of
circulating neutrophils have been associated with poor prognosis of COVID-19 patients
and analysis of lung biopsies and autopsy specimens showed extensive neutrophil
infiltration2,35–41. Further studies by Chua et al. (2020) employing single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) from upper and lower respiratory tract samples from COVID19 patients indicated a significant augmentation of neutrophils linked to transcriptional
program associated with tissue damage in epithelial and immune cells42. Re-analysis of
this scRNA-seq data42 shows that expression of NEU1, but not NEU3 or NEU4, is
upregulated in resident cells and highly expressed in neutrophils found in
nasopharyngeal/pharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 patients (Fig. 5). A similar profile of
NEUs expression was also observed in lower respiratory tract samples from these
patients (Supplementary Fig. 8). These results suggest NEU enzymes are highly

expressed by lung infiltrating neutrophils during severe COVID-19. As demonstrated by
Schulte-Schrepping et al. (2020)43, circulating neutrophils are highly activated on active,
but not convalescent, COVID-19 patients as observed by CD62L shedding (Fig. 6A)
and upregulation of CD66b (Fig. 6B). Moreover, neutrophils from severe COVID-19
patients were found to present a significant reduction of surface a2-3-Sia (Fig. 6C),
suggesting that NEU activity is also increased in blood neutrophils during severe
COVID-19. Therefore, we asked whether neuraminidase inhibitors can rescue
neutrophil activation from COVID-19 patients. Ex vivo treatment of whole blood with
Oseltamivir or Zanamivir decreased neutrophil activation and restored the levels of cell
surface a2-3-Sia (Fig. 6D-F). Fig. 6G summarizes the effects of Oseltamivir and
Zanamivir on the surface levels of CD62L and a2-3-Sia by neutrophils, where these
treatments lead to a formation of two different clusters in cells from severe COVID-19
patients. As soluble NEU enzymes are also present in plasma15, we next asked if
plasma from COVID-19 patients can induce neutrophil response from healthy donors.
Indeed, stimulation of whole blood from healthy donors with fresh plasma from severe,
but not convalescent, COVID-19 patients leads to neutrophil activation (Fig. 6H),
reduction of a2-3-Sia (Fig. 6I) as well as ROS production (Fig. 6J,K), which were
significantly reduced by Oseltamivir or Zanamivir (Fig. 6H-J). Additionally, we observed
that activity of NEU is increased in plasma from severe COVID-19 patients
(Supplementary Fig. 9A). Serum glycoproteins from severe COVID-19 patients also
presented reduced levels of a2-3-Sia (Supplementary Fig. 9B-E) suggesting NEU
activation in vivo. Moreover, plasma samples from severe COVID-19 patients that were
heat-inactivated to inhibit soluble NEU activity (Supplementary Fig. 9F) still induces

neutrophil activation (Fig. 6H,I,K), suggesting that cellular NEU in conjunction with
circulating factors mediate NEU-dependent neutrophil activation in severe COVID-19.
These results highlight host NEU as a regulator of neutrophil activation in severe
COVID-19 and suggest this pathway as a potential host-directed intervention target to
rewire neutrophil responses during severe disease.

DISCUSSION

Systemic inflammatory responses may lead to unsuitable neutrophil stimulation, which
is associated with higher mortality rates in sepsis and sepsis-like diseases44. Therefore,
finding new therapeutic options to prevent neutrophil overstimulation while maintaining
their microbicidal abilities is greatly needed. Based on the findings presented here, NEU
inhibitors are promising drugs to fill this gap. We demonstrated that endogenous host
NEUs mediate exacerbated inflammatory responses by primary neutrophils. Clinically
used viral NEU inhibitors, Oseltamivir and Zanamivir, decrease human NEU activity and
are effective in preventing LPS-induced neutrophil responses or to rescue
overactivation of neutrophils from COVID-19 patients. In severe murine sepsis,
therapeutic use of Oseltamivir fine-tunes neutrophil migration results in bacterial
clearance and high survival rates.

All of the four different isotypes of NEU described in mammals (NEU1, NEU2, NEU3
and NEU4) remove Sia from glycoproteins and glycolipids with specific substrate
preferences45. NEU1 cleaves preferentially a2-3-Sia and seems to be the most
important isoenzyme in immune cells. NEU1 is a lysosomal enzyme but it is also
present at the cell surface where it can regulate multiple receptors such as Fc gamma
receptor (FcγR), insulin receptor, integrin β-4, and TLRs46. While several stimuli were
described to induce NEU activity including LPS14, PMA, calcium ionophore A23187,
fMLP21, and IL-847, how NEUs are activated is poorly understood. However, NEU1
activation involves formation of a multicomplex of enzymes that stabilizes NEU1 in its

conformational active state48. Interestingly, NEU1 was found to be associated with
matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) at the surface of naive macrophages49. LPS binding
to TLR4 leads to activation of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) via Gɑi subunit and
MMP9 to induce NEU1 activity, which in turn removes a2-3-Sia from TLR4, allowing its
dimerization and intracellular signaling25,49,50. Although we have not formally addressed
whether the LPS-TLR4 pathway directly activates NEU function in human neutrophils,
our results employing MAL-II preincubation suggest desialylation is required for LPSmediated neutrophil responses. Thus, it is possible that NEU controls Sia levels in TLR4
molecules in human neutrophils as observed in macrophages and dendritic cells25,50.
The effects of LPS on neutrophil responses observed here are in accordance with the
well-documented induction of ROS and NETs as well as in phagocytosis and bacterial
killing by these phagocytes51–55. Importantly, the upstream involvement of NEU
regulating LPS responses by neutrophils is in agreement with the previous
demonstration that TLRs stimulate these cells independent of gene transcription51.
Together, our data suggests that NEU activation provides a fast response to enhance
microbial-induced neutrophil functions. Thus, we speculate that this could be an
evolutionary mechanism by which neutrophils quickly mobilize their microbicidal
mediators against pathogens.

Sialic acid removal from the surface of neutrophils markedly changes their
adhesiveness, chemotaxis, and migration21,56–59. In peritonitis- or pneumonia-induced
sepsis in mice, we observed that Oseltamivir prevented the massive neutrophil
infiltration into bronchoalveolar spaces or lung tissues, suggesting that regulation of

neutrophil migration by dampening NEU activity contributes to survival of septic mice.
Interestingly, we observed a divergent effect of Oseltamivir on neutrophil migration to
the focus of infection between peritonitis- and pneumonia-induced sepsis. This could be
explained by the different mechanisms involved in neutrophil migration to the peritoneal
cavity and lungs. While expression of CD62L and rolling of neutrophils to endothelium is
necessary for its migration to the peritoneal cavity, it seems to be not required for
migration into the lungs3,60. Moreover, systemic neutrophil activation leads to cell
stiffening, resulting in retention of neutrophils in the small capillaries of the lungs61,
which is frequently the first organ impaired in non-pneumonia- and pneumonia-induced
sepsis62. The role of NEU-induced neutrophil activation suggested here agrees with
previous demonstration that NEU1 deletion in hematopoietic cells confers resistance to
endotoxemia16. Also, the sialidase inhibitor Neu5Gc2en protects endotoxemic irradiated
wild-type (WT) mice reconstituted with WT bone marrow but not WT mice reconstituted
with NEU1-/- bone marrow cells16. Similar to our finds, the treatment of mice with NEU
inhibitors increases host survival in E. coli-induced sepsis15. This outcome was
correlated with significant inhibition of blood NEU activity. Enhancement of soluble NEU
activity in serum decreases the Sia residues from alkaline phosphatase (APL) enzymes,
which are involved in the clearance of circulating LPS-phosphate during sepsis15.

SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to mild illness in most of the patients, but ~20% of them
progress to severe disease with many characteristics resembling sepsis, including acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cytokine storm, and neutrophil dysregulation38,63–

severe COVID-19 patients are related to cell dysfunction, coagulation, and NETs
formation39,43. We observed that blood neutrophils from severe COVID-19 are highly
activated as demonstrated by reduced CD62L expression and increase of CD66b
expression, as previously reported43. We now add new information by showing that
NEU1 is highly expressed in the respiratory tract of moderate and critical COVID-19
patients and blood neutrophils from severe, but not convalescent, COVID-19 patients
have reduced surface levels of a2-3-Sia, suggesting a relevant role of NEU for COVID19 pathology. More importantly, both the NEU inhibitors Oseltamivir and Zanamivir,
increased the a2-3-Sia content and rewired the overactivation of neutrophils from
severe COVID-19 patients. We speculate that the addition of NEUs competitive
inhibitors allowed the endogenous sialyltransferases to restore sialyl residues on
surface glycoconjugates. Fast changes of surface sialic acid levels by sialidases and
sialyltransferases seems to be an important mechanism to control neutrophil
response56. In neutrophils from healthy donors or COVID-19 convalescent patients,
Oseltamivir and Zanamivir did not interfere in resting state and had no effect on a2-3Sia content, suggesting that NEU has a low effect on surface Sia turnover on nonactivated neutrophils. How neutrophils are activated and the role of NEU in this process
remains to be defined in COVID-19, nevertheless, recent evidence showed that
neutrophils could be directly activated by SARS-CoV-22, cytokines66, and alarmins39,43
such as calprotectin39, a TLR4 ligand67. Furthermore, we now suggest that soluble NEU
with other circulating factors present in plasma from severe COVID-19 patients also
accounts for neutrophil activation.

Collectively, this work suggests that host NEU activation leads to shedding of surface
sialic acid with consequent neutrophil overstimulation, tissue damage, and high
mortality rates. On the other hand, NEU inhibitors-prevented shedding of sialic acid and
regulates neutrophil response, resulting in infection control and high survival rates
(working model in Supplementary Fig. 10). Considering that both drugs have a safety
profile with few well-known adverse effects, our data suggest Oseltamivir and Zanamivir
could be repurposed for the treatment of sepsis or severe infections such as COVID-19.
Interestingly, a retrospective single-center cohort study including 1190 patients with
COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, showed that administration of Oseltamivir was associated
with a decreased risk of death in severe patients68. Our data suggest that such
encouraging results may be explained by the inhibition of NEU-mediated neutrophil
dysfunction in vivo. Nevertheless, randomized clinical trials with clinically used NEU
inhibitors in sepsis and COVID-19 are required to directly explore this hypothesis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Human blood samples

Blood was collected from healthy donors (25 - 45 yr old, n=3-12) in endotoxin-free tubes
with K3EDTA (Labor Import, Brasil). All participants gave their written informed consent
for blood collection after being informed on procedures. The research protocol followed
the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of the Federal University of Santa Catarina (CAAE
#82815718.2.0000.0121). Blood samples were also collected from severe COVID-19
(n=6) or convalescent COVID-19 (n=8) patients (25 to 89 yr old) admitted in the
Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or NUPAIVA (Research Center on Asthma and Airway
Inflammation) at the UFSC University Hospital from August to October 2020. Blood
samples from sex-matched healthy donors were used as controls. All patients or a close
family member gave consent for participation in the study, which was approved by the
UFSC IRB (CAAE #36944620.5.1001.0121). Supplementary Table 1 summarizes
patients clinical and laboratory records. These samples were used to analyze neutrophil
activation, surface a2-3-Sia as well as the effect of plasma under these parameters and
ROS production. Blood samples were also collected from severe COVID-19 (n=5)
patients (55 to 73 yr old) admitted at the Hospital Naval Marcílio Dias (HNMD). The
research was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (CEP) from Brazilian
National Health Council. All patients signed a free and informed consent form following
current legislation and the relevant ethical regulations approved by the Hospital Naval

the sialylation of plasma proteins. Supplementary Table 2 summarizes the clinical and
laboratory information of patients from this cohort.

Evaluation of neutrophil activation, phagocytosis, killing, ROS, and NETs release

Whole blood containing 1 x 106 leukocytes were incubated (37 oC, 5% CO2) in the
presence or absence of Oseltamivir (100 µM, Sigma-Aldrich, San Luis, MO, USA),
Zanamivir (30 µM, Sigma-Aldrich), LPS (1 µg/mL, E. coli 0127:b8, Sigma-Aldrich), LPS
plus Oseltamivir or LPS plus Zanamivir for 90 min. Concentrations of Oseltamivir and
Zanamivir used here were chosen by concentration-effect experiments (10-100 µM
Oseltavimir and 1-30 µM Zanamivir) (data not shown). Since plasma is a rich source of
glycoconjugates, total leukocytes were used instead of whole blood to evaluate the
effect of isolated neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens (CpNEU) on neutrophils.
Red blood cells (RBCs) were lysed by lysis buffer (0.15 M NH4Cl; 0.1 mM EDTA; 12 mM
Na2HCO3) for 7 min, RT, followed by centrifugation (270 x g; 22°C; 7 min). Total
leukocytes (1 x 106 cells) were incubated (37 oC, 5% CO2) in the presence or absence
of CpNEU (10 mU, Sigma-Aldrich), CpNEU plus Oseltamivir (100 µM) or CpNEU plus
Zanamivir (30 µM) for 60 min. Next, the following assays were performed. Analysis of
neutrophil activation. Leukocytes were then washed and resuspended in FACS buffer (2
mM EDTA/PBS). The mix of antibodies against CD66b (G10F5; BioLegend, San Diego,
CA, USA), CD62L (DREG-56; BioLegend), CD16 (3G8; BioLegend), isotypes or

coupled to Streptavidin (Biolegend), plus human BD Fc BlockTM (BD PharmingenTM) and
Fixable Viability Stain (FVS, BD HorizonTM, San Jose, CA, USA) were added to
leukocytes for 30 min at 4 oC. Cells were washed, resuspended in FACS buffer,
acquired in a FACSVerse cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo software (FlowJo LLC).
Approximately 100.000 gated events were acquired in each analysis. Phagocytosis
assays. After RBCs lysis, 1 x 106 leukocytes were incubated at 37 oC (5% CO2) or at 4
°C (control) with 100 µg/mL pHrodo™ Red E. coli BioParticles® (Thermo Fisher,
Waltham, MA, USA) for 60 min and the MFI of neutrophils (FVS-/CD66b+ cells) with
ingested bioparticle was analyzed by FACS. Total leukocytes were also incubated with
1 x 106 CFU of live E. coli (ATCC 25922) for 90 min (37 oC, 5% CO2). Next, the cells
were washed twice (2 mM EDTA/PBS), fixed (FACS buffer/PFA 2%) and the
percentage of neutrophils with bacteria or the percentage of neutrophils with ≥3 bacteria
was analyzed by light microscopy using Differential Quick Stain Kit (Laborclin, Brazil).
Bacterial killing. Total leukocytes (1 x 106) were incubated (37 oC, 5% CO2) with 1 x 106
CFU of live E. coli for 180 min. The samples were centrifuged (270 g, 7 min, 4 oC) and
10 µL of supernatant were diluted until 106 and spread onto agar brain-heart infusion
(BHI, Kasvi, Brazil) to quantify the viable extracellular bacteria. The pellets were washed
twice with PBS/2 mM EDTA (270 g, 7 min, 4 oC), the leukocytes were lysed with 2%
Triton-X, washed (PBS, 2000 g, 15 min, 4 oC), resuspended in PBS and 10 µL of
samples were diluted until 106 and spread onto agar BHI. Plates were incubated
overnight at 37 oC and viable bacteria were expressed as mean ± SEM of CFU/mL.
ROS assay. After RBCs lysis, 1 x 106 leukocytes were incubated at 37 oC (5% CO2) with
10 µM of cell-permeant 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA,

13-acetate (PMA) for 10 min, fixed, washed twice with PBS/2 mM EDTA (270 g, 7 min,
4 oC) and analyzed by FACS. NETs assay. NETs quantification was performed as
previously described69 on the supernatant of isolated neutrophils. Briefly, an anti-MPO
antibody bound to a 96-well flat-bottom plate captured the enzyme MPO (5 μg/ml;
Abcam), and the amount of DNA bound to the enzyme was quantified using the QuantiT™ PicoGreen® kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Fluorescence intensity (Ex 488 nm/Em 525 nm) was quantified in a
FlexStation 3 Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). Neutrophil
isolation. Human circulating neutrophils were isolated by Percoll density gradients70.
Briefly, four different gradients, 72%, 65%, 54%, and 45%, were used to isolate human
circulating neutrophils. After centrifugation at 600 g for 30 min at 4 °C, the cell layer at
the 72% gradient interface was collected as the neutrophil fraction. The erythrocytes
were removed by lysis, and cell pellets were resuspended in RPMI 1640. Isolated
neutrophils (1 x 106/well) were treated with Oseltamivir, Zanamivir or medium 1 h before
the stimulus with PMA (50 nM) or LPS (10 µg/mL). After 4 hr of stimuli (37 oC, 5% CO2),
the supernatant was collected to measure the levels of NETs.

Neuraminidase kinetics assay

After RBCs lysis, 0.5 x 106 leukocytes were resuspended in HBSS and added to 96-well
flat-bottom dark plate (SPL Life Sciences, South Korea) on ice. Then, 4Methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-⍺-D-Neuramic Acid (4-MU-NANA, Sigma-Aldrich) substrate

(0.025 mM) was added followed by medium, or LPS (1 µg/mL), LPS plus Oseltamivir
(100 µM), LPS plus Zanamivir (30 µM). CpNEU (10 mU), CpNEU plus Oseltamivir or
CpNEU plus Zanamivir were used as positive controls of the assay. The volume was
completed to 200 μL with HBSS, followed by reading on the Spectramax® Paradigm®
instrument starting 3 min after and every 5 min for 55 min at 37 ºC. Sialidase activity
was also assessed in heat-inactivated or fresh plasma from severe COVID-19 patients
in the presence or absence of Oseltamivir (100 µM) or Zanamivir (30 µM) using Tecan
Infinite 200 multi-reader. The fluorescent substrate 4-MU-NANA formation was detected
at ex 350 nm/em 450 nm.

Whole blood samples from sex-matched healthy donors (n = 7) were incubated for 2 h
(37 °C, 5% CO2) with 7% of fresh plasma from healthy donors, severe or convalescent
COVID-19 patients or heat-inactivated plasma (56 °C, 30 min) from severe COVID-19
patients in the presence or absence of Oseltamivir (100 µM) or Zanamivir (30 µM).
Surface levels of a2-3-Sia and CD66b and ROS production were assessed on
neutrophils by FACS.

Mice

The care and treatment of the animals were based on the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals72 and all procedures followed the ARRIVE guidelines and the
international principles for laboratory animal studies73. C57BL/6 (Jackson Laboratory,
Bar Harbor, ME, USA) mice (8–10 weeks old) and Swiss mice (10–12 weeks old) were
housed in cages at 21 ± 2°C with free access to water and food at the Animal Facility of
the Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Parasitology and Department of
Pharmacology from UFSC, respectively. A total of 228 mice were used in this study.
Protocols were approved by the Animal Use Ethics Committee of UFSC (CEUA
#8278290818).

E. coli-, Klebsiella pneumoniae- and CLP-induced sepsis

E. coli (ATCC 25922, Manassas, VA, USA) or K. pneumoniae (ATCC 700603) were
used to induce severe sepsis in mice. Naive mice were intraperitoneal (IP) challenged

with 100 µL of 1 x 107 CFU of the E. coli suspension. A group of E. coli-septic mice was
randomly pretreated (2 hr before infection) and post treated by per oral (PO, 12/12 hr)
via with saline or Oseltamivir phosphate (10 mg/kg, Eurofarma, Brazil) for 4 days to
survival analysis. Another group was pretreated 2 hr before infection with a single dose
of Oseltamivir phosphate (10 mg/kg, PO) and the pathophysiological response was
analyzed at 4 and 6 hr after infection. E. coli-septic mice were also randomly
posttreated (6 hr after infection, 12/12 hr) with saline or Oseltamivir phosphate (PO, 10
mg/kg) for 4 days to survival analysis. For pneumonia-induced sepsis, mice were
anesthetized with isoflurane (3–5 vol%) and placed in supine position. A small incision
was made in the neck where the trachea could be localized and a K. pneumoniae
suspension (4 x 108 CFU/50 µL of PBS) was injected into the trachea with a sterile 30gauge needle. Skin was sutured and animals were left for recovery in a warm cage.
After 6 hr of infection and then 12/12 hr mice were treated with Oseltamivir phosphate
(PO, 10 mg/kg) for survival analysis. In another set of experiments, pneumonia was
induced and mice were treated 6 hr after infection with a single dose of Oseltamivir
phosphate (10 mg/kg, PO) for material collection and analysis of pathophysiological
response 24 hr after infection.
Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis were performed as previously
described28. Mice were anesthetized with xylazine (2 mg/kg, IP, Syntec, Brazil) followed
by isoflurane (3–5 vol%, BioChimico, Brazil), a 1 cm midline incision was made in the
anterior abdomen, and the cecum was exposed and ligated below the ileocecal junction.
The cecum was punctured twice with an 18-gauge needle and gently squeezed to allow
its contents to be released through the punctures. Sham-operated (Sham) animals

underwent identical laparotomy but without cecal ligation and puncture. The cecum was
repositioned in the abdomen, and the peritoneal wall was closed. All animals received 1
mL of 0.9% saline subcutaneous (SC) and 100 µL of tramadol (5 mg/kg, SC, Vitalis,
Brazil) immediately after CLP. CLP-septic mice were randomly treated (starting 6 h after
infection, PO) with 100 µL of saline or Oseltamivir phosphate (10 mg/kg, 12/12 hr) for 4
days. In another set of experiments, CLP mice were randomly IP treated (6 hr after
infection, 12/12 hr) during 4 days with 100 µL metronidazole (15 mg/kg, Isofarma,
Brazil) plus ceftriaxone (40 mg/kg, Eurofarma, Brazil) and Oseltamivir phosphate (10
mg/kg) or saline by PO to survival analysis or treated for 36 hr to analyze the
pathophysiological response at 48 hr after CLP.

Neutrophil migration
The animals were euthanized in a CO2 chamber, the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and
peritoneal lavage (PL) were performed and the number of neutrophils was determined
at 4 and 6 hr after E. coli, 24 hr after K. pneumoniae infection or 48 hr after CLP
surgery, as described28. Next, mice were perfused with PBS/EDTA (1 mM) and the
lungs were harvested. Lungs were passed through 40-µm nylon cell strainers and
single-cell suspensions were centrifuged in 35% Percoll® solution (315 mOsm/kg,
Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min at 700 g to enrich leukocytes populations. Pelleted cells were
then collected, and erythrocytes were lysed. Single-cell suspensions from individual
mice were determined using a cell counter (Coulter ACT, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA,
USA) or with a haemocytometer. Differential counts were also determined on Cytospin
smears stained using Differential Quick Stain Kit (Laborclin, Brazil). Blood samples were

Neutrophils from LP or BAL were also stained with anti-Ly-6G/Ly-6C (GR-1, RB6-8C5;
BioLegend) and MAL-II to be further analyzed by FACS, as previously described.
Analysis was carried out in SSChigh/GR-1high cells.
Bacterial counts
The bacterial counts were determined as previously described28. Briefly, the BAL, PL or
blood were harvested and 10 µL of samples were plated on Muller-Hinton agar dishes
(Difco Laboratories, Waltham, MA, USA) and incubated for 24 hr at 37 °C. PL or BAL
samples were diluted until 106.

ELISA
TNF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and IL-17 (XpressBio Life Sciences
Products, Frederick, MD, USA) levels in plasma, PL or BAL were determined by ELISA
kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Tissue injury biochemical markers
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) activities, and the levels of total bilirubin were determined in plasma
samples by commercial kits (Labtest Diagnóstica, Brazil). The procedures were carried
out according to the manufacturer's instructions.

To evaluate if severe COVID-19 changes the a2-3 sialylation of serum glycoproteins,
serum samples from four healthy donors and five severe COVID-19 patients were
blotted with MAL-II as previously described74. Samples were diluted in SDS-PAGE
sample buffer and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Twelve µg of total protein were resolved
in 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore,
Burlington, MA, USA). Membranes were blocked (TBST + 5% BSA) overnight at 4 oC
and incubated for 2 hr with 1 µg/mL of biotin-conjugated MAL-II, washed and incubated
for 40 min with alkaline-phosphatase (ALP)-conjugated streptavidin (Southern Biotec,
Birmingham, AL, USA) diluted 1:10.000. Both MAL-II and streptavidin-ALP were diluted
in TBST (5% BSA plus 150 mM of CaCl2). Membranes were then revealed with
BCIP/NBT (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium) color
development substrate (Promega, Brazil). The lane intensities were quantified using the
Image J software. In parallel, the resolved SDS-PAGE were stained with Coomassie
Brilliant blue R 250 (Merck KGaA, Germany) to compare the protein profile between the
different samples.

Statistical analysis
The data are reported as the mean or median ± SEM of the values obtained from two to
seven independent experiments. Each experiment using human samples was
performed using three to five samples from healthy donors or one to three samples from
severe or convalescent COVID-19 patients. We used five mice per experimental group
except for survival analyses in which twelve to twenty mice were used. The mean or
median values for the different groups were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA)

followed by Dunnett and/or Tukey post-tests. Bacterial counts were analyzed by the
Mann–Whitney U-test or unpaired t-test using a parametric test with Welch’s correction.
Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan–Meier method and then compared using
the log-rank method and Gehan-Wilcoxon test. Data was analyzed using GraphPad
Prism version 8.00 for Mac (GraphPad Software, USA). A P < 0.05 was considered
significant.

CpNEU (0.012 UI) was added in a 96-well flat-bottom dark plate on ice in the presence
or not of its inhibitors Oseltamivir phosphate (100 µM) or Zanamivir (30 µM). Next, the
substrate 4-MU-NANA (0.025 mM) was added and the fluorescent substrate was read 3
min after at 37 ºC (A). The area under the curve (AUC) values are shown in B. Total
leukocytes resuspended in HBSS were added in a plate on ice and 4-MU-NANA
substrate (0.025 mM) was added followed by the addition of medium, LPS (1 µg/mL),
LPS plus Oseltamivir (100 µM) or LPS plus Zanamivir (30 µM). The fluorescent
substrate was read 3 min after at 37 ºC (C). Raw data were subtracted from the control
group containing only HBSS (medium) and expressed as AUC values (D). Whole blood
containing 1 x 106 leukocytes from healthy donors were stimulated or not with LPS (1
µg/mL, 90 min, 37 oC, 5% CO2), LPS plus Oseltamivir (100 µM), or LPS plus Zanamivir
(30 µM). Total leukocytes (1 x 106) were incubated with CpNEU (10 mU, 60 min, 37 oC,
5% CO2), CpNEU plus Oseltamivir (100 µM), or CpNEU plus Zanamivir (30 µM).
Leukocytes were stained with MAL-II to detect a2-3 sialic acids (E-F). The MFI was
analyzed on CD66b+ cells using the gate strategies shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. *P
< 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. This figure is representative of three independent
experiments (n= 3-6) and data are shown as mean ± SEM. LPS = lipopolysaccharide;
MAL-II = Maackia amurensis lectin II; CpNEU = neuraminidase.

(37 oC, 5% CO2) or not to LPS (1 µg/mL, 90 min), LPS plus Oseltamivir (100 µM), or
LPS plus Zanamivir (30 µM) (A-C; G-H; K). Total leukocytes (1 x 106) were exposed or
not to CpNEU (10 mU, 60 min, 37 oC, 5% CO2), CpNEU plus Oseltamivir (100 µM), or
CpNEU plus Zanamivir (30 µM) (D-F; I-J; L) and the phagocytosis and killing assays
were performed. Leukocytes were incubated with E. coli pHrodo BioParticles® (100
µg/mL) for 60 min at 37 °C to assess phagocytosis in viable CD66b+ cells (A-F) (as
gated in Supplementary Fig. 1). Live E. coli was used to evaluate phagocytosis by light
microscopy or to assess the killing by leukocytes. Cells were stimulated as described
above and 1 x106 leukocytes were incubated at 37 °C with E. coli (1 x106 CFU) for 90
min for phagocytosis or for 180 min for killing assays. The percentage of cells with
ingested bacteria (G; I) and the number of bacterial particles per cell (H; J, ³3 particles
per cell) were evaluated. The killing of E. coli was evaluated by spreading 10 µL of
supernatant (extracellular killing) or 10 µL of the intracellular content in agar medium
and the CFU were counted. Killing E. coli was expressed as the rate of fold change
compared to the unprimed (untreated) cells (L). Symbols represent individual donors
and data are shown as mean ± SEM from pooled data of two to three independent
experiments (n = 3-12). *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. Unt = untreated; LPS =
lipopolysaccharide; CpNEU = neuraminidase.

Figure 3. LPS-induced human neutrophil response involves NEU activity. Whole
blood from healthy donors containing 1 x 106 leukocytes were stimulated or not with
LPS (1 µg/mL, 90 min, 37 oC, 5% CO2), LPS plus Oseltamivir (100 µM), LPS plus
Zanamivir (30 µM), or LPS plus MAL-II (1 µg/mL, MAL-II promotes steric hindrance at
the NEU cleavage site and prevent sialic acid cleavage). Leukocytes were marked with
MAL-II to detect a2-3 sialic acids (A-C) or stained with the cell activation markers
CD62L (D-F) and CD66b (G-I). After RBCs lysis leukocytes were incubated with 5 µM
CM-H2DCFDA fluorescent probe for 15 min. PMA (10 µM) was used to stimulate ROS
production for 10 min (J-L). Supplementary Fig. 5 showed ROS production in additional
control groups. The MFI was analyzed on CD66b+ cells using the gate strategies shown
in Supplementary Fig. 1. Isolated neutrophils were treated with Osetamivir (100 µM) or
Zanamivir (30 µM) 1 h before the stimulus with LPS (10 µg/mL) for 4 h. The
concentration of NETs was evaluated by MPO-DNA PicoGreen assay on supernatants

Figure 4. Oseltamivir enhanced mice survival in K. pneumoniae-induced sepsis.
Sepsis was induced by intratracheal administration of K. pneumoniae and mice were
randomly treated (starting 6 hr after infection, 12/12 hr, PO, n=20) with saline or
Oseltamivir phosphate (10 mg/kg) and survival rates were monitored for 144 hr (A). In
similar set of experiments, septic mice (n=6-7) were treated 6 hr after infection with a
single dose of Oseltamivir phosphate (10 mg/kg, PO) and mice were euthanized 24 hr
after infection to determine the number of neutrophils (B) and CFUs (C), and levels of
TNF (D) and IL-17 (E) in BAL. Plasma levels of TNF (F), IL-17 (G), AST (H), ALT (I),
ALP (J) and total bilirubin (K) were also evaluated 24 hr after infection. The amount of
surface a2-3 sialic acids were assessed by MAL-II staining in SSChigh/Gr-1high cells in
BAL and analyzed by FACS, as shown by the representative histograms (L) and MFI

Supplementary Fig. 1. Representative gate strategy used for neutrophils analysis.
A classic forward-scatter (FSC) vs side-scatter (SSC) characteristic dot plot was used to
select neutrophils population (A) from peripheral blood collected from healthy donors
and patients. Autofluorescent (B) and doublets (C-D) were excluded and live cells were
selected (E). CD66b+ positive cells (F) were gated and the MFI of surface markers, such
as CD62L (G) were assessed. Around 96% of CD66b+ cells are mature neutrophils
(CD66b-high/CD16-high) and 4% of CD66b+ cells are CD66b-high/CD16-low, which is
suggestive of immature neutrophils or eosinophils (H). Approximately 100.000 gated
events were collected in each analysis. The analysis was performed in a FACSVerse
using FACSuite software (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software (FlowJo LLC).

Supplementary Fig. 7. Oseltamivir enhanced host survival in CLP-induced sepsis.
Severe sepsis was induced by the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model. Mice were
randomly treated (starting 6 hr after infection, 12/12 h, PO, for 36 hr, n=16) with saline
or Oseltamivir phosphate (10 mg/kg) and their survival rates were monitored over 48 hr
(A). In another set of experiments, CLP mice were randomly IP treated (started 6 hr
after infection, 12/12 hr) during 4 days with 100 µL metronidazole (15
mg/kg)/ceftriaxone (40 mg/kg) (ABX) plus saline or Oseltamivir phosphate (10 mg/kg)
by PO and their survival rates (n=12) were monitored over 168 hr (B). Also, mice were
subjected to CLP and treated with ABX + saline or ABX + Olsetamivir as described in B
and euthanized 48 hr after surgery to evaluate the number of neutrophils in BAL (C),
lung tissue (D), and peritoneal lavage (PL) (E); TNF (H), IL-17 (I), and CFU (F) were
also determined in PL. Blood CFU (G) and plasmatic levels of TNF (J), IL-17 (K), AST
(L), ALT (M), ALP (N) and total bilirubin (O) were also evaluated 48 hr after surgery.

Supplementary Fig. 10. Working model. PAMPs and DAMPs in severe diseases such
as sepsis and COVID-19 lead to neuraminidase activation with shedding of surface
sialic acid and neutrophil overactivation, resulting in tissue damage and high mortality
rates. On the other hand, neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g., Oseltamivir, Zanamivir) prevent
the sialic acid release to regulate neutrophil response, resulting in infection control and
high survival rates.
