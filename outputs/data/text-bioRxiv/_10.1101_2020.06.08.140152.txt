Abstract
The iconic “red crown” of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) is made of its spike (S) glycoprotein. The S protein is the Trojan
horse of coronaviruses, mediating their entry into the host cells. While SARS-CoV-2
was becoming a global threat, scientists have been accumulating data on the virus at
an impressive pace, both in terms of genomic sequences and of three-dimensional
structures. On April 21st, the GISAID resource had collected 10,823 SARS-CoV-2
genomic sequences. We extracted from them all the complete S protein sequences and
identified point mutations thereof. Six mutations were located on a 14-residue
segment (929-943) in the “fusion core” of the heptad repeat 1 (HR1). Our modeling in
the pre- and post-fusion S protein conformations revealed, for three of them, the loss
of interactions stabilizing the post-fusion assembly. On May 29th, the SARS-CoV-2
genomic sequences in GISAID were 34,805. An analysis of the occurrences of the
HR1 mutations in this updated dataset revealed a significant increase for the S929I
and S939F mutations and a dramatic increase for the D936Y mutation, which was
particularly widespread in Sweden and Wales/England. We notice that this is also the
mutation causing the loss of a strong inter-monomer interaction, the D936-R1185 salt
bridge, thus clearly weakening the post-fusion assembly.

Introduction
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus belonging to
the β genus coronaviruses, which also include two highly pathogenic human viruses
identified in the last two decades, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)
(1-3).
Coronaviruses are named after the protruding spike (S) glycoproteins on their
envelope, giving a crown (corona in latin) shape to the virions (4). Of the four
structural proteins of coronavirues, S, envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid
(N), the S protein is the one playing a key role in mediating the viral entry into the
host cells (5-7), making it one of the main targets for the development of therapeutic
drugs and vaccines (8-14). Comprised of two functional subunits, S1 and S2, it first
binds to a host receptor through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit
and then fuses the viral and host membranes through the S2 subunit (7,15). In the prefusion conformation, the SARS-CoV-2 S protein forms homotrimers protruding from
the viral surface, where its RBD binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2
(ACE2) receptor on the host cell surface (1) (like the SARS-CoV homolog (16), and
differently from MERS-CoV S, which recognizes a different receptor, the dipeptidyl
peptidase 4 (17)). Receptor binding and proteolytic processing by cellular proteases
then cause S1 to dissociate and S2 to undergo large-scale conformational changes
towards a stable structure, bringing viral and cellular membranes into close proximity
for fusion and infection (7,15,18).
While the outbreak of COVID-19 was rapidly spreading all over the world, affecting
millions of people and becoming a global threat, laboratories worldwide promptly
started to sequence a large number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. All the available
genomic data is accessible through the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data
(GISAID) website, an invaluable open access resource (19,20). Simultaneously,
crucial structural knowledge has been achieved on SARS-CoV-2, especially regarding
the S protein. 3D structures are now available from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (21)
for the SARS-CoV-2 S protein in the pre-fusion conformation, also bound to the

ACE2 receptor (22-28), and for the post-fusion core of its S2 subunit in the postfusion conformation (29).
On April 21st 2020, 4 months after the first sequencing (30), 10,823 genomic
sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were available from GISAID. Therefore, we considered
the time ripe for an assessment of the mutational spectrum of the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein. To this aim, we extracted all the complete S protein sequences from the
GISAID 21st April dataset and identified all the mutations occurring in at least 2
identical sequences (see Table S1). From this analysis, a 14-amino acid segment in
the fusion core of the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) emerged as a hotspot for mutations.
While the mutations we identified corresponded to a 1 mutation every 12 positions
along the protein sequence, as many as 6 amino acids were found to be mutated in the
above 14-amino acid segment: S929, D936, L938, S939, S940 and S943.
After the proteolytic processing, in the post-fusion conformation, the S protein HR1
and HR2 motifs interact with each other to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB), which
promotes initiation of the viral and cellular membranes fusion. The HR1 “fusion core”
is named after its role in giving many interactions with HR2 in the post-fusion
conformation, thus playing a key role in the virus infectivity (31). Based on the
structural location of the above highly concentrated mutations and on their nonconservative nature, we considered them of particular interest and decided to further
investigate their structural basis, both in the pre- and post-fusion conformation, as
well as their sequencing dates and geographical distribution. As we show in the
following, as many as three of them are responsible for the loss of inter-monomer Hbonds in the post-fusion conformation, while one of them, S943P, would introduce
unexpected structural strain in the pre-fusion conformation.
A search in the GISAID resource updated to May 29th showed a significant increase
in occurrences especially for one mutant, D936Y, unreported to date, which has
become a common variant in some European countries, especially Sweden. It is also
the mutant having the most significant structural role, causing the loss of an intermonomer salt bridge in the post-fusion assembly.

We downloaded the 10,823 genomic sequences available from GISAID on April 21st
2020. From these sequences, we extracted the nucleotide sequences of the spike
protein and translated them to protein sequences with in-house scripts. Nucleotides
sequences featuring an internal stop codon, having at least one undefined (“N”)
nucleotide or resulting in spike proteins of length different from 1,273 amino acids
were discarded. Sequences annotated as pangolin, bat or canine were also discarded.
The remaining 7,692 protein sequences were further analysed. First, we clustered
them in sets of identical sequences with CD-HIT (32), obtaining 120 clusters of at
least 2 sequences and 245 unique sequences. As a reference system for further
analyses, we used the first dated (on December 24th 2019) genomic sequence in
GISAID, isolated and sequenced in Wuhan (Hubei, China) (30). Then, upon
alignment to the reference sequence, we identified point mutations in all the sets of at
least two sequences.
We downloaded again the 34,805 genomic sequences available from GISAID on May
29th 2020 (gisaid_hcov-19_2020_05_29_14) and followed the above pipeline to
extract 23,332 complete 1273-residue long S protein sequences. We then recorded the
presence and frequency in them of any mutation occurring in the fusion core of the
HR1 (residues 929-949) with in-house scripts.

Mutants modelling and analysis
Mutants 3D models were built using the mutate_model module of the Modeller 9v11
program (33). This is an automated method for modelling point mutations in protein
structures, which includes an optimisation procedure of the mutated residue in its
environment, beginning with a conjugate gradients minimisation, continuing with
molecular dynamics with simulated annealing and finishing again by conjugate
gradients. The used force field is CHARM-22, for details see Reference (34). Models
for mutants in the pre-fusion conformation were built starting from the EM structure
of the pre-fusion trimeric conformation (PDB ID: 6VSB, resolution 3.46 Å, (22)).
Models for mutants in the post-fusion conformation were built starting from the X-ray
structure of the S2 subunit fusion core (PDB ID: 6LXT, resolution 2.90 Å, (29)).
Molecular models were analysed and visually inspected with Pymol (35). The

COCOMAPS web server (36) was used to analyse the inter-chain contacts and Hbonds as well as the residues accessibility to the solvent.

Results and Discussion
We downloaded all the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences from the GISAID resource
on April 21st 2020, extracted from them 7,692 complete S protein sequences and
identified all the point mutations occurring in at least two identical sequences (see
Methods). The 111 mutations we identified, occurring at 105 different positions
spread all over the protein sequence, are reported in Table S1, with the relative
number of occurrences.
While the mutations we identified were spaced on average 12 positions along the
protein sequence, a segment of 14 amino acids harboured 6 mutations, at positions
929, 936, 938, 939, 940 and 943, proposing itself as a mutational hotspot. This
sequence segment is part of the “fusion core” of the HR1, in the protein S2 subunit.
The HR1 of coronaviruses S proteins undergoes one of the most notable
rearrangements within the protein between the pre- and post-fusion conformations. In
the post-fusion conformation, in fact, it experiences a refolding of the pre-fusion
multiple helices and intervening regions into a single continuous helix (Figure 1). As
already mentioned, three of these long helices then form a 6HB with three HR2
helical motifs (18,29,31). The HR1 and its “fusion core” in particular thus play a
crucial role in the virus infectivity.

HR1 “fusion core” mutations: update on April 21st
The following 6 mutations were identified in the fusion core of the HR1 on April 21st
2020: S929I, D936Y, L938F, S939F, S940F, S943P. Two of these mutations, D936Y
and S943P, were among the most frequent in the ensemble of mutations we identified.
Besides the widespread D614G, now dominant over the original D614 variant
(37,38), only 5 other mutations (two of them being very peripheral, L5F and P1263L)
recurred indeed in ≥ 20 sequences (see Table S1). S943P was also reported in (38),
where it was hypothesized to be spreading via recombination.

The D936Y mutation was found in 25 sequences overall. In 22 sequences it was
associated to the D614G mutation, while in 2 sequences it was associated to both the
D614G and the A1020V mutations. The first D936Y/D614G variant was reported as a
single sequence in USA (Washington) on March 15th, then, starting from March 17th
in England (7 sequences, March 17th to 31st), Wales (7 sequences, March 17th to 30th),
the Netherlands (4 sequences, March 18th to 29th) and Iceland (3 sequences, March
19th to 28th). The 2 D936Y/D614G/A1020V variants were both reported from Wales,
on March 26th and 30th, therefore it might be hypothesized that they originated from
the D936Y/D614G variant, already circulating in Wales at the time. In addition, the
D936Y mutation was found in a unique S protein sequence, from France, dated March
18th, where it was not associated to the D614G variant.
The 22 sequences featuring the S943P mutation on April 21st were all from Belgium.
Twenty of them were associated to the D614G mutation and were reported between
March 1st and March 20th. In addition, two unique sequences featured the S943P
mutation.
The S939F mutation was found associated to the D614G mutation in 8 sequences. It
was first reported in 1 sequence from France on March 4th, then in 1 sequence from
Iceland on March 16th, then again in 5 sequences from USA (Utah) between March
19th and March 29th, then, finally, in 1 sequence from the Netherlands on April 2nd. In
addition, this mutation was found in a unique S protein sequence, from Switzerland,
dated February 26th, where it was not associated to the D614G variant.
The L938F mutation was a particularly late one; it was found in 2 sequences,
associated to the D614G mutation, both from England and dated March 29th.
The S929I mutation was found in 2 sequences from USA (Washington), dated March
12th and 27th, associated to the D614G mutation.
Finally, the S940F mutation had a unique geographical distribution, as it was found in
2 sequences from Australia (New South Wales) dated February 28th and March 4th,
not associated to the D614G mutation. In addition, it was found in 1 single sequence
from France, dated March 20th, where it was associated to the D614G mutation.
In conclusion, with the exception of S940F, which was found in Australia, all the
mutations in the HR1 core fusion were spread in two continents, Europe and/or North
America.

Furthermore, most of them originated from the D614G variant. This is in agreement
with them seeming to be quite late mutations, sequenced starting from the end of
February/March 2020, i.e. over two months after the first Wuhan variant dated
December 24th 2019 (30) (Table 1). The frequency and geographical distribution of
D936Y especially are noteworthy, considering that it was first sequenced only on
March 15th.

Update on May 29th
On May 29th 2020, we analysed the frequency of the above mutations and the
emergence of other possible mutations in the HR1 fusion core in the updated GISAID
dataset, containing 34,805 genomic sequences, from which we extracted 23,332
complete S protein sequences, thus roughly tripling the originally analysed April 21st
dataset. The result was someway surprising.
A positive selection pressure seemed to emerge for the D936Y mutation, which
passed from the 25 cases of the April 21st dataset to the 213 cases of the May 29th
dataset, corresponding to a ≈9-fold increment. Of the novel occurrences of the D936Y
mutation, only 2 were found in USA (Utah and Minnesota), while most of them came
from Europe, especially from UK, 68 from England, 56 from Wales and 1 from
Scotland, and from Sweden, 55. Notably, the total number of occurrences of the
D936Y mutation amounted to the 20.5% of all the 273 sequences available from
Sweden, and to the 2.7% and 1.4% of all the sequences available from Wales and
England (5397 and 2374, respectively). The remaining ones came from Denmark, 5,
and Poland, 1.
The ≈3-fold increment in frequency of the S929I and S939F mutants was in line with
the increment of the sequences in the dataset. The three additional occurrences of the
S929I mutation were from USA (Washington), Wales and England. A novel S929T
mutation was also reported twice from Scotland. Additional occurrences of the S939F
mutation were instead from USA, 7, England, 2, Kazakhstan, 1, and UAE, 1. As for
the L938F and S940F mutants, their increment was significantly lower than the
increment of the sequences in the dataset. A positive selection thus clearly hasn’t
emerged to date for these mutations. The only additional occurrence of L938F was

from Denmark, while the 2 additional occurrences of S940F were from France and
USA (Washington).
The S943P mutation represented a special case. Most of the sequences harbouring
such a mutation were indeed modified between the April 21st and the May 29th
datasets, so that they do not feature anymore the mutation to proline. However, 3
novel occurrences of the same mutation, S943P, emerged from China (Beijing). In
addition, 3 sequences from Scotland presented the novel S943I mutation.
As for the remaining positions of the HR1 fusion core, to May 29th, either they were
fully conserved (S937, K933, A942, A944, L945, G946, K947 and Q949), or they
hosted one single occurrence of mutation (to valine for A930, to aspartate for I931
and G932, to histidine for Q934 and D935, to alanine for T941 and to arginine for
L948). Because of the rarity of such mutations, we will not discuss them here.
However, we will continue to monitor them over time.

Sequence conservation
All the amino acids undergoing mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein are
conserved in the bat coronavirus RaTG13 S protein (sharing an overall sequence
identity of 97% with SARS-CoV-2 S protein), while as many as five of them are
mutated in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein (overall 76% sequence identical to the SARSCoV-2 homolog) (see Figure 1). Four of these mutations are however conservative
(aspartate to glutamate, serine to threonine), except S929, which is a lysine in SARSCoV. It has been proposed that such mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 HR1 may be
associated with enhanced interactions with the HR2, further stabilizing the 6-HB
structure and maybe leading to increased infectivity of the virus (29). It is noteworthy
that no one of the point mutations we identified restored the corresponding SARSCoV amino acid.

Effect of the mutations on the protein pre-fusion conformation
In the pre-fusion conformation, all the mutated positions, but S943, are located on the
second of four non-coaxial helical segments composing the HR1 (Figure 1). Four of
them, S929, D936, S939 and S940, are exposed to the solvent (Table 2), and can be

modelled as larger (mostly aromatic) residues without causing any structural strain
(see Figure 2). These mutations are not expected to cause relevant changes in the prefusion structure, although they could have a destabilizing effect as a consequence of
posing large aromatic residues in direct contact with the solvent instead of smaller
apolar (leucine), polar (serine in 2 cases) or even charged (aspartate) residues. In
addition, S940 involves its side-chain in a H-bond with the main-chain of D936, 4
residues upstream. The loss of this H-bond in the S940F mutant also points to a slight
destabilization of the pre-fusion conformation. As for L938, it is buried in the prefusion conformation, pointing towards a three-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet made of
the S711-P728 segment from the S1 subunit and of the Y1047-P1053 and G1059A1078 segments from the S2 subunit, without directly contacting it (distances above 5
Å). It can also be modelled as a large phenylalanine without causing sterical strain.
Upon mutation, it seems to optimize the hydrophobic interactions with the
neighboring residues, especially I726 and A944.
Finally, S943 is located on a turn immediately downstream the helical segment
hosting the above five mutations, between the second and third helical segments. The
wild-type residue S943 features φ and ψ dihedral angles of 58.5° and 24.5°,
respectively, which fall in an unfavourable region for prolines. In the S943P model
we generated, the P943 φ and ψ dihedrals assume the values of 3.0° and 68.2°,
placing the residue in an outlier region (39). The favoured φ angle for prolines is
indeed restricted to the value of -63 ± 15°, (40) characteristic of α-helices. A proline
at such a position would therefore introduce an anomaly in the pre-fusion
conformation, while strongly promoting the transition to the post-fusion single
continuous helical conformation. It is also worth noticing that this would be the only
mutation among those we identified so far, introducing a proline residue in the SARSCoV-2 S protein (Table S1). In light of the analysis of the GISAID May 29th updated,
we also modelled the S943I mutation. Being isoleucine compatible with the S943
dihedral values, this mutation does not result in any structural strain.
Effect of the mutations on the protein post-fusion conformation
When looking at the post-fusion conformation of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S2
subunit, these mutations appear more revealing. Three of the wild-type residues,
S929, D936 and S943, are indeed engaged in side-chain to side-chain H-bonds with
10

the HR2 segment of an adjacent monomer. In particular, S929, D936 and S943 (HR1
on Chain A) are H-bonded to S1196, R1185 and E1182, respectively (HR2 on Chain
C, Figure 3). These are all strong H-bonds, especially the one between S943 and
E1182, involving a negatively charged residue, and the one between D936 and
R1185, being actually a salt bridge (estimated to contribute an additional 3-5 kcal/mol
to the free energy of protein stability as compare to a neutral H-bond (41)). All these
three H-bonds are lost upon mutation, which points to a weakening of the post-fusion
assembly.
Of the remaining three mutations, S939F is completely exposed to the solvent and
therefore, like in the pre-fusion conformation, expected to act unfavourable on the
protein solvation energy. On the contrary, in case of L938F and S940F, which are
substantially buried within the structure, mutation to a large aromatic phenylalanine
seems even to optimize the network of the hydrophobic interactions; in case of F940,
with the aliphatic parts of the side-chains of E1182 and R1185 on an adjacent
monomer, and, in case of F938, with V1189 and A1190 on the same monomer and
with other F938 residues on both the adjacent monomers.
When comparing the effect of the mutations on the pre- and post-fusion structures, it
emerges that the S929I, D936Y and S943I mutations strongly destabilize the postfusion conformation, while having a marginal impact on the stability of the pre-fusion
one. On the contrary, S940F seems to favour the post-fusion conformation over the
pre-fusion one. As for S938F and S939F, they seem to have a comparable effect on
both the conformations, slightly stabilizing and destabilizing, respectively. Finally,
the S943P mutation would strongly destabilize both the pre- and post-fusion
conformations.

Conclusions
Based on a thorough analysis of the S protein sequences, that we extracted from the
genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 reported in GISAID on April 21st, we identified
the fusion core of the HR1 as a mutational hotspot. The D936Y and S943P mutations
were the most numerous, being among the most frequently occurring mutations
overall at the time. Other, less frequent, mutations were S939F and then S929I, L938F
and S940F. Overall, such mutations appeared to be late ones, emerging starting from

the end of February or even mid March 2020, and were mainly localized in Europe
and USA. Based on their frequency, on their location in a protein region playing a key
role in the post-fusion conformation and also on the non-conservative nature of the
mutations themselves, we decided to further investigate the structural basis of such
mutations, finding out that they all can play a role in tuning the stability of the preand/or post-fusion S protein conformation.
A search of the GISAID dataset updated to May 29th revealed a ≈9-fold increase of
the D936Y mutation over time (versus a ≈3-fold increase in the dataset sequences of
203%), thus indicating a possible positive selection for it. Notably, the D936Y variant
represented the 20.5% of all the sequences reported from Sweden and the 2.7 and 1.4
% of all the sequences form Wales and England, respectively.
Other potentially interesting mutations are S929I and S939F, whose number of
occurrences underwent a ≈2/3-fold increase. On the other hand, the increment in the
occurrence of L938F and S940F was marginal, posing less emphasis on such
mutations, which will be nonetheless useful to continue monitoring.
Finally, the S943P mutation, although still reported in few cases, underwent a
dramatic reduction of occurrences, due to modification of the original sequences
where they were first reported. At the same time, a S943I mutation emerged, that will
also be worth continuing to monitor. We remind here that a proline at position 943
would cause a significant destabilization on the S protein pre-fusion conformation.
It is also worth noticing that the 2 mutations significantly increasing their frequency
over time, D936Y and S929I, were also those that, together with S943P/I, caused the
loss of a inter-monomer H-bond in the post-fusion conformation of the protein.
Interestingly, the now emerging S943I mutation gets the same effect without
destabilizing the pre-fusion conformation. The most frequently occurring mutation in
the HR1 “fusion core”, common in Sweden and UK on May 29th, is also the one
causing the loss of a strong inter-monomer salt bridge. Our structural analyses provide
a rationale for such mutations, pointing to a weakening of the post-fusion assembly.
However, only experiments on cellular systems will clarify whether this may be a
virus strategy for reducing its membrane fusion capacity, thus lowering its virulence.
