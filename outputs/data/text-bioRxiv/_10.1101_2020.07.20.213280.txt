Summary

21

Biochemical and structural analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is well-adapted to infecting

22

human and the presence of four residues (PRRA) at the S1/S2 site within the Spike protein may

23

lead to unexpected tissue or host tropism. Here we report that SARS-CoV-2 efficiently utilized

24

ACE2 of 9 species except mouse to infect 293T cells. Similarly, pseudoviruses bearing spike

25

protein derived from either the bat raTG13 or pangolin GX, two closely related animal

26

coronaviruses, utilized ACE2 of a diverse range of animal species to gain entry. Removal of

27

PRRA from SARS-CoV-2 Spike displayed distinct effects on pseudoviral entry into different cell

28

types. Strikingly, insertion of PRRA into the raTG13 Spike selectively abrogated the usage of

29

horseshoe bat and pangolin ACE2 but conferred usage of mouse ACE2 by the relevant

30

pseudovirus to enter cells. Together, our findings identified a previously unrecognized effect of

31

the PRRA insert on SARS-CoV-2 and raTG13 spike proteins.

Introduction

42

The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 or 2019-

43

nCoV) has quickly turned into a global pandemic. Multiple studies have suggested a zoonotic

44

origin of SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the potential of coronaviruses to continuously evolve in

45

wild animal reservoirs and jump to new species (Andersen et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a).

46

Various bat species are believed to be reservoirs of progenitors of diverse coronaviruses (CoVs)

47

including the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.

48

Indeed, the closest virus to SARS-CoV-2 found up to date is the bat raTG13 with over 96%

49

identity at genomic level (Zhou et al., 2020b). A newly reported bat RmYN02 shares 93.3%

50

nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2 genomewide and 97.2% identity in the 1ab gene (Zhou et

51

al., 2020a). Besides bat CoVs, pangolin/GD/2019 CoV and pangolin/GX/P5L/2017 CoV share

52

up to 90% and 85.2% sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2, respectively (Liu et al., 2020; Zhang

53

et al., 2020). While the origin of the novel coronavirus appears to be in bat reservoirs, there is

54

still no definitive evidence of an intermediate host that could have transmitted the virus to

55

humans.

56
57

The coronavirus spike protein plays a pivotal role in mediating coronavirus entry (Belouzard et

58

al., 2012; Li, 2016). The ectodomain of SARS-CoV spike protein is divided into two subunits,

59

S1 and S2. SARS-CoV S1 contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that specifically binds to

60

human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) whereas S2 subunit contains the fusion peptide

61

(Li et al., 2005; Li et al., 2003). Like SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in pre-fusion

62

conformation is a homotrimer, with three S1 heads sitting on top of a trimeric S2 stalk (Shang et

63

al., 2020b; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020). Based on a structure of the SARS-CoV-2
3

64

spike ectodomain containing two stabilizing mutations, it was observed that at a given time, only

65

one of three RBD is in an upward position for receptor binding (Wrapp et al., 2020). However, a

66

very recent structural study of a full-length, fully wild-type form of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein

67

suggested that the prefusion structure is in the “all-down” configuration (Yongfei Cai, 2020).

68

Interaction between RBD and ACE2 is thought to lock the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in a

69

conformation that makes it susceptible to multiple cellular proteases (Yan et al., 2020), including

70

cell surface protease TMPRSS2 and lysosomal proteases cathepsins (Hoffmann et al., 2020;

71

Millet and Whittaker, 2015). Proteolytic cleavage of SARS-CoV spike at the S1/S2 boundary

72

causes S1 to dissociate so that S2 undergoes a dramatic structural change to induce fusion(Millet

73

and Whittaker, 2015). All this evidence indicates that SARS-CoV-2 may follow the footstep of

74

SARS-CoV to enter host cells.

75
76

In comparison to SARS-CoV and other betacoronaviruses, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2

77

displays two distinct features: 1) SARS-CoV-2 appears to have been well adapted for binding to

78

the human receptor ACE2, despite significant sequence divergence in its RBD region in

79

comparison to that of SARS-CoV (Lan et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020). 2) A distinct four amino

80

acid insert within the spike (S) protein (underlined, SPRRAR↓S) between the S1 receptor

81

binding subunit and the S2 fusion subunit presumably creates a functional polybasic (furin)

82

cleavage site. This novel S1/S2 site of SARS-CoV-2 Spike is hypothesized to affect the stability,

83

transmission and/or host range of the virus (Jaimes et al., 2020a; Jaimes et al., 2020b).

85

In this study, we set out to determine 1) if SARS-CoV-2 infects cells via diverse animal ACE2;

86

2) how the PRRA insert at the S1/S2 site affects the cellular and host range of SARS-CoV-2 and

87

its closely related RaTG13. Our findings not only demonstrated the wide usage of ACE2 from

88

diverse animal species by SARS-CoV-2, raTG13 and pangolin GX, but also revealed a striking

89

effect of insertion of PRRA on raTG13 spike protein regarding its usage of ACE2 derived from

90

horseshoe bat, pangolin and mouse.

Results

105

Efficient infection of cells expressing ACE2 of diverse species by SARS-CoV-2

106

Structural and biochemical studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may have been well

107

adapted in human before the outbreak in Wuhan, China (Andersen et al., 2020; Shing Hei Zhan,

108

2020). Despite significant variation in the receptor binding motif (RBM) from that of the SARS-

109

CoV spike, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein appears to have evolved a mechanism to efficiently

110

utilize human ACE2 to gain entry. Such a feature had not previously been recognized. Besides

111

human, SARS-CoV-2 reportedly infects domesticated pets, such cats and dogs (Shi et al., 2020),

112

and wild animals, such as mink (Nadia Oreshkova, 2020), raising the concern of cross species

113

transmissions. To test whether SARS-CoV-2 may use ACE2 of different species to infect cells,

114

we transfected 293T cells to express ACE2 from 10 different species, including human, mouse,

115

horseshoe bat, pangolin, Syrian (SYR) hamster, Chinese (CHN) hamster, African green monkey

116

(Agm), bovine, pig, ferret. Cells were subsequently infected by SARS-CoV-2 that expresses the

117

monomeric neon green fluorescent protein (mNeonGreen) (Xie et al., 2020). Except mouse

118

ACE2, expression of all ACE2 (Fig. S1A) rendered cells susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection

119

(Fig. 1).

PRRA-led proteolytic cleavage of SARS-CV-2 Spike protein

122

Next, we sought to investigate the role of the PRRA insert in SARS-CoV-2 entry. To confirm

123

cleavage by cellular proteases at this site, we transfected 293T cells with constructs expressing

124

the wild type SARS-CoV-2 spike (SARS-CoV-2 S), a mutant with PRRA removed (SARS-CoV-

125

126

(raTG13 S+PRRA), and the Pangolin GX Spike protein (Pangolin GX S) (Fig. 2A). We used a

127

mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes the S2 domain of both SARS-CoV spike and SARS-

128

CoV-2 spike proteins for detection. A partial cleavage was noticed when SARS-CoV-2 Spike

129

was expressed in 293T cells and the deletion of PRRA abolished the cleaved form (Fig. 2B).

130

Interestingly, raTG13 spike was partially cleaved even in the absence of PRRA. Insertion of

131

PRRA insertion into raT13 S further enhanced the cleavage by about 2-fold. Lastly, pangolin GX

132

spike protein did not show similar cleavage pattern in transfected 293T cells. To confirm that the

133

cleavage occurs in the context of infection, western blotting was performed using SARS-CoV-2

134

infected VeroE6 cell lysate, similar cleavage pattern was observed (Fig. 2B). Of note, the extent

135

of the observed cleavage appears to vary significantly among susceptible cell lines. While the

136

ratio of the cleaved over noncleaved Spike appears to be comparable between 293T and Vero E6,

137

infected human lung epithelial cell line Calu-3 and intestinal cell line Caco-2 by SARS-CoV-2

138

yielded banding patterns that indicate a rather complete cleavage of the spike protein in Caco-2

139

and nearly no cleavage in Calu-3 cells (Fig. 2B and Fig. S1B).

140
141

A pre-cleaved spike protein at S1/S2 could confer unexpected fusogenic capability on the plasma

142

membrane and allow coronaviruses undergo receptor-independent entry (virus–cell fusion) (Li,

143

2016; Miura et al., 2008). To assess the Spike protein-mediated membrane fusion, we set up a

144

quantitative cell-cell fusion assay in which 293T acceptor cells, containing a loxP-flanked STOP

145

cassette that blocks transcription of the downstream luciferase reporter gene, were cocultured

146

with Cre-expressing donor cells. In this assay, fusion between donor and acceptor cell

147

membranes removes the STOP cassette and hence permits luciferase production. Various spike

148

constructs were transfected into donor cells and then the hACE2 plasmid was transfected into the

149

acceptor cells. Notably, even in the absence of hACE2, SARS-CoV-2 spike induced about 5-fold

150

over the background (Fig. 2C). Deletion of PRRA from SARS-CoV-2 spike completely

151

abolished this basal level activity. In the presence of ACE2, all spike proteins induced cell-cell

152

fusion to varying extents (up to 30-fold) above background with the wild type SARS-CoV-2

153

Spike being the most efficient one. Surprisingly, insertion of the novel PRRA into raTG13 S and

154

deletion of PRRA from SARS-CoV-2 S both reduced fusogenic ability in the presence of ACE2

155

in comparison to their wild type counterparts. Finally, addition of TMPRSS2 only marginally

156

affected the Spike-driven cell-cell fusion (Fig. 2C).

157
158

The PRRA insert at the S1/S2 site distinctly modulates cell susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2

159

pseudovirions

160

Next, we sought to investigate the impact of PRRA insert on virus entry. To this end, we

161

packaged pseudoviruses bearing SARS-CoV-2 S, SARS-CoV-2 S ∆PRRA, raTG13 S, raTG13

162

S+PRRA, and Pangolin GX S. Again, we noticed a basal level of infection by pseudovirus

163

bearing SARS-CoV-2 Spike into 293T cells even in the absence of ACE2 (Fig. S2A). This

164

finding is consistent with the observed basal level of cell-cell fusion that is mediated by SARS-

165

CoV-2 Spike. Surprisingly, pseudovirus carrying SARS-CoV-2 S ∆PRRA consistently infected

166

Vero E6 and 293T-hACE2 cells at about half to one log10 higher than the wild type SARS-CoV-

167

2 spike (Fig. 3A and Fig. S2B). By contrast, infection of the human lung epithelial cell line Calu-

168

3 as well as the human intestinal cell line Caco-2 by the same pseudoviruses were reduced by 90-

169

50%, respectively, compared to pseudoviruses bearing the wild type SARS-CoV-2 S or raTG13

170

S (Fig. 3B&C). Among the five pseudoviruses, bat raTG13 spike appears to be the least efficient

171

one in mediating pseudovirus entry through hACE2. Insertion of PRRA into raTG13 Spike

172

further reduced the pseudovirus entry into all cell types that were tested (Fig. 3A-C). Pseudovirus

173

bearing the Pangolin spike is highly infectious on 293T-hACE2 (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the

174

spike protein displayed on pseudoviruses bearing SARS-CoV-2 S, raTG13 S, raTG13 S+PRRA

175

were almost completely cleaved, whereas it was noncleaved on pseudovirions carrying the

176

SARS-CoV-2 S ∆PRRA (Fig. 3D). Pangolin GX S on the pseudovirions appears to display an

177

entirely different pattern with potentially partial cleavage (Fig. 3D). Lastly, expression of

178

TMPRSS2 increased the infectivity of pseudoviruses bearing SARS-CoV-2, raTG13 S, and

179

raTG13 S+PRRA by about one log, but not those bearing SARS-CoV-2 S ∆PRRA and the

180

Pangolin GX S (Fig. 3E).

181
182

The novel S1/S2 site alters the dependence of raTG13 pseudovirus on ACE2 of different

183

species

184

The PRRA insert between S1/S2 boundary of SARS-CoV-2 Spike is suspected to alter stability,

185

transmission and even host range of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that a bat

186

virus, rather than a pangolin virus, remains the most probable origin of SARS-CoV-2 (Lau et al.,

187

2020). Given the evolutionary gap, raTG13 is unlikely to be the direct ancestor virus of SARS-

188

CoV-2, rather it branched out from the same ancestor (Xiaolu Tang, 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a).

189

To compare the usage of ACE2 from different species by SARS-CoV-2 and raTG13, we

190

transfected 293T cells with ACE2 of 10 different species and then infected them with

191

pseudoviruses bearing SARS-CoV-2 S, SARS-CoV-2 S ∆PRRA, raTG13 S, raTG13 S+PRRA,

192

and Pangolin GX S. Bald virus (envelope free) and pseudovirus bearing the vesicular stomatitis

virus glycoprotein G (VSV-Gpp) were included in the study as negative and positive control.

194

Pseudovirions bearing SARS-CoV-2 spike efficiently infected all but mouse ACE2 expressing

195

cells. The same observation was made with pseudoviruses bearing SARS-CoV-2 S ∆PRRA and

196

raTG13 S. Most strikingly, pseudovirus bearing raTG13 S+PRRA lost the ability to infect cells

197

via pangolin and horseshoe bat ACE2 but gained infectivity via mouse ACE2 (Fig. 4).

198

Pseudovirions bearing pangolin Spike efficiently entered cells via all ACE2 (including mouse

199

ACE2 albeit by a one-log10 reduction). The above experiment was repeated in the presence of

200

TMPRSS2 and same observations were made (Fig. S3).

213

Discussion

214

Here we experimentally demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of infecting cells via ACE2

215

of a diverse range of species. Noticeably, a recent bioinformatics analysis ranked horseshoe bat

216

and ferret ACE2 in the low or very low group in terms of the likelihood of bind SARS-CoV-2

217

(Damas et al., 2020), yet we found that SARS-COV-2 efficiently utilized both ACE2 to enter

218

cells. Such a sharp contrast highlights the unpredictability of animal ACE2 that could be used by

219

SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells based on current structural or sequence information. A secondary

220

finding is that besides SARS-CoV-2, pseudoviruses bearing both bat raTG13 S and Pangolin GX

221

S entered cells via a wide range of ACE2. Pangolin GX spike seems to use ACE2 from an even

222

broader range of species to gain entry, at least in the case of mouse ACE2. Interestingly, despite

223

a 87% identity to SARS-CoV-2 in the RBD region (Shang et al., 2020b), the RBM of

224

pangolin/GX spike protein contains both residues that are favorable for ACE2 recognition

225

(Leu455 and the 482–485 loop) and those that are less favorable for ACE2 recognition (Leu486,

226

Glu493 and Thr501). Therefore, it was predicted that CoV-pangolin/GX may not recognize

227

human ACE2 (Shang et al., 2020b). Yet our results here showed otherwise. Overall, our findings

228

support potential cross-species transmissions of bat or pangolin coronaviruses, but also highlight

229

the importance of surveying animal coronaviruses for their abilities to infect human cells.

230
231

This study also revealed a rather convoluted role of the PRRA insert between S1 and S2 subunits

232

in SARS-CoV-2 entry. The presence of PRRA in SARS-CoV-2 clearly resulted in one (or two)

233

cleavage site(s). However, at least on 293T-hACE2 cells, pseudovirus bearing SARS-CoV-2 S

234

∆PRRA exhibited even greater infectivity, suggesting that PRRA is dispensable to the Spike-

235

driven viral entry. The raTG13 spike, which does not contain the PRRA sequence, is readily
11

236

cleavable under the same condition. Addition of PRRA to raTG13 Spike further enhanced the

237

cleavage but decreased the relevant pseudovirus infectivity on 293T-hACE2 cells, indicating that

238

addition of PRRA does not enhance raTG13 Spike-driven entry. It is worth mentioning that

239

SARS-CoV-2 and raTG13 spike protein sequences are identical within 76 residues downstream

240

and upstream of the PRRA S1/S2 site (Supplemental Information). We envision that SARS-

241

CoV-2 and raTG13 spike may adopt different structure conformations near the S1/S2 boundary

242

such that the exact region within SARS-CoV-2 is less accessible as opposed to that in raTG13.

243

Nonetheless, the PRRA insert and its mediated cleavage is clearly dispensable for pseudovirus to

244

enter 293T-hACE2 cells. Having said that, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein does exhibit a basal level

245

of fusogenic activity in the absence of ACE2, which is not seen with other spike proteins that

246

were tested in this study. In consistence, we observed a basal level of infection of 293T cells by

247

SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of exogenous ACE2 expression. Whether this reflects a receptor-

248

independent route of entry or not needs to be further investigated, but it is possible that this basal

249

level of fusogenic activity of SARS-CoV-2 could lead to cell-cell transmission. Overall, the

250

spike protein-mediated cell-cell fusion in hACE2-293T cells largely correlates with the

251

pseudovirus infectivity in the same cell type.

252
253

The PRRA insert appears to be essential for efficient Spike-dependent pseudovirus entry into the

254

human lung epithelial cell line Calu-3. Two recent studies also reported similar findings

255

(Hoffmann et al., 2020; Shang et al., 2020a). Such a sharp contrast with what was observed on

256

293T-hACE2 cells may be partially attributed to the relative abundance of proteases in cells. The

257

acquisition of the 4 amino acid insert (PRRA) has been thought to broaden the activating

258

protease repertoire of the SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 cleavage site. Indeed, Jaimes et a.l. reported that
12

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.20.213280; this version posted July 21, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

259

the S1/S2 site of SARS-CoV-2 S is efficiently cleaved by furin-like, trypsin-like, and cathepsin

260

proteases (Jaimes et al., 2020b). Hence, depending on the availability of the activating protease

261

in each cell type, PRRA-guided cleavage may be subjected to differential regulations. In support

262

of this notion, we noticed a partial cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 spike in 293T cells, whereas

263

SARS-CoV-2 infected Caco-2 cells also exhibited much more extensive cleavage of spike

264

although we cannot confirm whether this is mediated by the PRRA site. Astoundingly, similar

265

cleavage occurs at a level that is barely detectible in Calu-3 cells despite it supports SARS-CoV-

266

2 infection. RNA-seq analyses of SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells revealed

267

different protease repertoires with cathepsin A being expressed to a much higher level in Caco-2

268

(Figure S4). It is conceivable that the spike protein is cleaved by different host proteases among

269

293T, Calu-3 and Caco-2. Given the very low level of cleavage that was observed in Calu-3

270

cells, it is plausible that the PRRA site becomes more important for the activating protease to

271

cleave and prime Spike. Notably, CoVs enter the host cells via the endocytic pathway and non-

272

endosomal pathway (Zumla et al., 2016). It is unclear which route is utilized for SARS-CoV-2 to

273

enter lung cells, but the protease repertoires in endosomes versus that on the plasma membrane

274

are expected to be different, which may further impact the infectivity of different pseudoviruses.

275
276

The most striking finding of this study is that insertion of PRRA into the raTG13 spike protein

277

altered the ability of relevant pseudovirus to utilize ACE2 of three species to gain entry.

278

Specifically, pseudovirus bearing raTG13 S+PRRA lost its ability to infect cells via pangolin and

279

horseshoe bat ACE2 yet gained infectivity via mouse ACE2. The latter finding is particularly

280

astounding given entry of all other pseudoviruses was somewhat impaired via mouse ACE2. The

281

implications of this finding are twofold: First, if SARS-CoV-2 and raTG13 share the same

282

ancestor which originates from horseshoe bat, it is likely that acquisition of PRAA would render

283

this bat ancestor virus less efficient infecting horseshoe bat, hence the virus would have to find a

284

new host. Secondly, insertion of PRRA may have a previously unrecognized impact on Spike-

285

ACE2 interaction. Up to date, the interaction interface between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and

286

ACE2 lies between the receptor binding motif of spike protein and several residues of ACE2.

287

Based on the known structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, PRRA is part of a protruding loop

288

that is rather distal to the RBD, hence is not expected to modulate Spike-ACE2 interaction.

289

Binding of RBD to ACE2 locks the spike protein into a conformation such that the S1/S2

290

becomes more accessible to proteolytic cleavage and hence primes the fusion peptide for

291

subsequent viral-cell fusion. Modeling SARS-CoV-2 Spike and mouse ACE2 interaction

292

predicts that mouse ACE2 is unlikely to support entry, which has been widely verified in

293

experiments including this one (Wan et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020b). Our findings, however,

294

suggest raTG13 Spike may adopt a different conformation from SARS-CoV-2 Spike and the

295

presence of PRRA may subtly modulate the binding of its RBD to ACE2 of horseshoe bat,

296

pangolin and mouse.

297
298

In summary, we showed that spike proteins from all three viruses, SARS-CoV-2, bat CoV

299

raTG13, and CoV-pangolin/GX, have the potential to mediate entry using ACE2 from multiple

300

animal species besides human. The PRRA insertion selectively allows SARS-CoV-2 to infect

301

human lung cell line Calu-3 and unexpected altered dependence of raTG13 Spike on ACE2 of

302

three species.

409

The SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 was obtained from BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH, and

410

had been passed three times on Vero cells and 1 time on Vero E6 cells prior to acquisition. It was

411

further passed once on Vero E6 cells in our lab. The virus has been sequenced verified to contain

412

no mutation to its original seed virus. A reporter virus inserting the monomeric neon green

413

(mNG) in the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 backbone was obtained from Dr. Pei-Yong Shi’s

414

laboratory (university of Texas Medical Branch) at passage 2 and was further expanded once on

415

Vero E6 (Xie et al., 2020) at FDA.

Virus titration

418

SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 was titered using the Reed & Muench Tissue Culture

419

Infectious Dose 50 Assay (TCID50/ml) system (L.J. Reed, 1938). Vero cells were plated the day

420

before infection into 96 well plates at 1.5 x 104 cells/well. On the day of the experiment, serial

421

dilutions of virus were made in media and a total of 6-8 wells were infected with each serial

422

dilution of the virus. After 48 hours incubation, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde

423

followed by staining with 0.1% crystal violet. The TCID50 was then calculated using the

424

formula: log (TCID50) = log(do)+ log (R)(f+1). Where do represents the dilution giving a

425

positive well, f is a number derived from the number of positive wells calculated by a moving

426

average, and R is the dilution factor.

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus production

453

Human codon-optimized cDNA encoding SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein (NC_045512) was

454

synthesized by GenScript and cloned into eukaryotic cell expression vector pcDNA 3.1 between

455

the BamHI and XhoI sites. Pseudovirions were produced by co-transfection Lenti‐X 293T cells

456

with psPAX2, pTRIP-luc, and SARS-CoV-2 S expressing plasmid using Lipofectamine 3000.

457

The supernatants were harvested at 48h and 72h post transfection and filtered through 0.45-mm

458

membranes. To pellet down pseudovirions, the viral like particles were centrifuged at 20,000 xg

459

for 2 h at 4 °C, then resuspend in SDS-PAGE sample buffer after removing all supernatant.

460

Alternatively, pseudovirions were produced by co-transfection Lenti‐X 293T cells with pMLV-

461

gag-pol, pFBluc, and pcDNA 3.1 SARS-CoV-2 S using Lipofectamine 3000. The supernatants

462

were harvested at 48h and 72h post transfection and filtered through 0.45-mm membranes. The

463

MLV-based pseudovirus infects VeroE6 cells more efficiently than HIV-based counterpart.

CoV Spike-Mediated Cell–Cell Fusion Assay

466

In brief, 293T cells were transfected with hACE2 and Stop-Luc construct which contains a firefly

467

luciferase reporter gene whose transcription is prevented by a Stop cassette flanked by LoxP sites.

468

24 h post-transfection, these recipient cells were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with 293T cells expressing

469

Cre and CoV S (donor cells) to initiate cell–cell fusion. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h

470

thereafter.

Immunoblotting

483

Cell lysates were prepared with RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4]; 1% NP-40; 0.25% sodium

484

deoxycholate; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma); 1 mM sodium

485

orthovanadate), and insoluble material was precipitated by brief centrifugation. Protein

486

concentration of lysates was determined by BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific). Lysates

487

containing equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 4-20% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to

488

a nitrocellulose membrane (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE), blocked with 10% milk for 1 h, and incubated

489

with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were blocked with Odyssey Blocking

490

buffer (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE), followed by incubation with primary antibodies at 1:1000

491

dilutions. Membranes were washed three times with 1X PBS containing 0.05% Tween20 (v/v),

492

incubated with IRDye secondary antibodies (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) for 1 h, and washed again to

493

remove unbound antibody. Images were captured by the Odyssey CLx infrared imaging system

497

Total RNA extracted from Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells were used for sequencing library preparation.

498

RNA quality was assessed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA,

499

USA) and the RNA integration numbers (RIN) were all greater than 9. Poly-A enriched stranded

500

libraries were generated using TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina, San

501

Diego, CA, USA), following Illumina’s protocol. In brief, 0.5 µg of total RNA was poly-A

502

enriched, fragmented, and reverse transcribed into cDNAs. Double stranded cDNAs were

503

adenylated at the 3′ ends and individually indexed followed by 15-cycle PCR amplification. The

504

quality and yield of prepared libraries were evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and Qubit

505

4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Libraries of mRNA-Seq were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq

506

6000 instrument following the manufacture’s instruction. Data analysis was performed using

507

RNA-Seq tool of CLC Genomics Workbench V12 (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), which aligned

508

the paired-end reads to the human hg38 reference genome and calculated the gene expression.

509

For each sample, reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) was calculated to show

510

expression level. The full dataset can be found in Table S1.
