Abstract

32

Background: The COVID-19 pandemic posed a unique challenge for summer research

33

programs in 2020, particularly for programs aimed at hands-on experience for younger trainees.

34

The Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center supports two

35

pipeline programs, which traditionally immerse high school juniors, seniors, and early

36

undergraduate students from underrepresented populations in science in hands-on projects in

37

cancer biology labs. However, due to social distancing policies during the pandemic and

38

reduction of research operations, these students were not physically allowed on campus. Thus,

39

the authors set out to strategically pivot to a wholly virtual curriculum and evaluate the Virtual

40

Summer Research Experience in Cancer outcomes.

41

Methods: The virtual program included four components: 1. a core science and professional

42

development curriculum led by high school teachers and senior undergraduates; 2. faculty-

43

delivered didactic sessions on cancer science; 3. mentored, virtual research projects with research

44

faculty; and 4. online networking events to encourage vertical mentoring. Outcomes data were

45

measured using an 11-item Research Preparation scale, daily electronic feedback, and structured

46

evaluation and feedback via Zoom weekly.

47

Results: Outcome data suggested high self-reported satisfaction with the virtual program.

48

Outcome data also revealed the importance of coordination between multiple entities for

49

seamless program implementation. This includes the active recruitment and participation of high

50

school teachers and further investment in information technology capabilities of institutions.

51

Conclusions: Findings reveal a path to educate and train high school and early undergraduate

52

students in cancer research when hands-on, in-person training is not feasible. Virtual research

53

experiences are not only useful to engage students during public health crises but can provide an

Background
The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant challenges to the United States

60

healthcare system [1, 2]. Many Academic Health Centers and Cancer Centers were charged with

61

maintaining the traditional tripartite mission of clinical care, research, and education. Within

62

medical education, virtual or distance learning combined with simulation became more common

63

[1, 3]. Similarly, graduate medical and research education incorporated virtual didactic and

64

telemedicine training [3-7]. Here, we describe the strategic pivot to the Virtual Summer

65

Research Experience in Cancer (vSREC) from two traditional pipeline programs, aimed at

66

immersing high school juniors, seniors, and early undergraduate students from underrepresented

67

populations in biomedical science.

68

Providing early biomedical research opportunities has been shown to enhance future

69

interest in biomedical careers [8]. Student-reported gains included disciplinary skills, research

70

design, information or data analysis skills, information literacy, self-confidence, communication,

71

and professional advancement [9-11]. Importantly, the impact of early biomedical research

72

experiences is higher among students from underrepresented backgrounds [12, 13]. These

73

research experiences and the resulting sense of responsibility positively impact academic and

74

career success after accounting for parental income, IQ, and other factors that influence

75

achievement [14]. In addition to focusing on diverse student trainees, teachers’ participation in

76

research programs that include laboratory research and professional development can improve

77

their students’ achievement in science [15].

78

Several National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated cancer centers have instituted

79

summer research programs (SRP) for high school and early undergraduate students

80

underrepresented in biomedical research. Since 2003, the Indiana University Simon

81

Comprehensive Cancer Center (IUSCCC) has provided summer research experiences to over

82

300 students, hereafter termed interns, from underrepresented populations, defined using the NIH

83

definition of populations underrepresented in the extramural biomedical workforce (detailed in

84

Additional file 1). In addition, in 2013, IUSCCC launched the Future Scientist Program (FSP),

85

focusing on high school juniors in the Indianapolis Public School district, which contains a high

86

percentage of disadvantaged students. The two-month-long programs not only provided first-

87

hand research experience in cancer but also allowed students to develop long-term professional

88

relationships with faculty mentors. Over 70% of interns have entered healthcare/science

89

professions, and several have become physician-scientists, physicians, or biomedical scientists

90

(unpublished data).

91

Previously, SRP and FSP had a similar structure: interns received a stipend to work on a

92

research project in a faculty mentor’s laboratory (usually bench-based research) for 6–8 weeks,

93

culminating in a poster and/or oral presentation. The laboratory experience was enriched by

94

attendance at guest lectures on cancer biology and clinical cancer care, workshops on

95

college/medical/graduate school applications and professional etiquette, and formal didactic

96

training in research ethics, responsible conduct of research, and use of animals in research. Also,

97

interns had social and celebratory events along with vertical mentoring opportunities with other

98

trainees to teach how to network and navigate the university environment. IUSCCC also more

99

recently initiated a 3–4-week high school teacher research program (TRP), placing teachers in

100
101

research laboratories for hands-on experience.
Preparation to launch SRP, FSP, and TRP for the 2020 summer started in Fall 2019

102

(Figure 1A), and application review, interviews, and candidate selection were almost complete

103

just before the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV2 novel coronavirus [16] forced a

104

“hibernation” of research on our campus, pausing all but essential in-person research, as Indiana

105

and much of the United States were placed under stay-at-home orders [17]. Since an in-person

106

program became impossible, we opted to retool the curriculum as a virtual experience because of

107

the importance of the programs in the lives of young interns, not just as a career-enhancing

108

experience, but also as a full-time, stipend-based activity in a summer with few other options.

109

Here, we describe how the traditional SRP and FSP pipeline programs were modified into

110

a virtual summer program, named Virtual Summer Research Experience in Cancer (vSREC), and

111

its impact on participating interns. This first-of-its-kind virtual pipeline program is unique in that

112

it brought together a diverse group of high school and undergraduate students, high school

113

teachers, IUSCCC leadership, and faculty mentors with a shared goal to provide a positive

114

experience in early biomedical research. Such a program is not only useful in future situations

115

that require virtual learning, but also could be implemented on a routine basis to provide summer

116

opportunities to students from rural school districts, non-research-intensive universities, or

117

universities not affiliated with a cancer center or medical school.

Study Participants

120

All vSREC interns were invited to participate from May 2020 to July 2020. Intern

121

demographics are detailed in Table 1 and included six Caucasian, 14 African American, one

122

Asian, and one mixed-race interns. This study received approval from the Institutional Review

123

Board at Indiana University (IRB protocol #1110007280). All procedures followed were in

124

accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation

125

and with the declaration of Helsinki.

mirrored the objectives of the in-person programs of previous years: to expose interns to

131

university-level cancer research through a full-time, paid summer program; to introduce concepts

132

in cancer biology and medicine; to inspire interns to pursue further studies in science and/or

133

medicine; and to build long-term relationships between mentors and interns. For vSREC, we

134

added the objective of enhancing contemporary scientific literacy through education on virology

135

and SARS-CoV2, as new knowledge in this area was moving incredibly rapidly in the summer of

136

2020, along with significant dissemination of misinformation [18]. Additionally, we aimed to

137

provide hands-on training for dealing with diversity and inclusion. This training was particularly

138

timely during the Summer 2020 period of Black Lives Matter protests across the United States

139

and recognition of racism, discrimination, and microaggressions in health care settings [19-22].

support, vertical mentoring, and campus navigation and networking advice. Local science

149

teachers designed and delivered a 6-week core curriculum covering topics related to the research

150

processes, scientific literacy, ethics, and grade-level resources for academic and career

151

advancement. IUSCCC faculty delivered engaging lectures in cancer biology, starting with

152

fundamental cancer topics and moving through areas of specialty, while also modeling various

153

career paths. Faculty also served as research project mentors along with their laboratory groups,

154

providing virtual projects that could be done remotely. These included in silico analyses,

155

literature reviews, and analyses of existing imaging or other datasets, plus virtual training in

156

laboratory techniques. Finally, engaging networking events gave students the chance to interact

157

with peers and others. Further details of these components are provided in Additional file 2. An

Evaluation Methods

165

Survey instruments were created locally to evaluate the interns’ perceptions of the

166

vSREC educational and research experience, their mentors, and the skills learned from the

167

virtual experience. Furthermore, a 11-item Research Preparation scale was developed to assess

168

whether interns perceived they improved their understanding of the research process as a result

169

of the program. A post-survey of mentors was similarly administered. Surveys were collected

170

and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools. REDCap (Research Electronic Data

171

Capture) is a secure, web-based application designed to support data collection for research [23].

172

At the beginning of the vSREC, interns were invited to complete a pre-survey that

173

collected demographic information, and a Research Preparation scale that evaluated the degree to

174

which interns felt prepared and able to conduct research. Further, using free responses, interns

175

were asked what they hoped to learn from the program and to discuss any concerns about the

176

virtual research experience.

177

Interns completed a post-survey at the end of the program that included the same 11-item

178

Research Preparation scale as well as scales evaluating the overall research and educational

179

experience and evaluation of the research mentor. Free responses collected data about what

180

interns learned from the research experience, future career goals, and their overall perception of

181

the virtual research experience.

182

A Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was used to compare interns’ responses on the Research

183

Preparation scale, using SPSS v.27 (IBM Corp, Armonk NY). Significance was set at p ≤ 0.05.

184

Responses to the post-survey were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Finally, free response

185

data from pre- and post-surveys were coded and analyzed using thematic analysis.

187

Pre-Program Concerns

188

All 22 interns in the vSREC completed the pre-survey. In a free-text response, six interns

189

expressed concerns about having a different research experience due to the virtual format.

190

Specifically, they worried about not getting hands-on experience and having difficulty working

191

with their mentors at a distance.

192

Program Outcomes: Interns

193
194

A total of 18 interns completed the post-survey (12 in the SRP and six in the FSP, 82%
response rate). All interns agreed or strongly agreed that their mentors were available to answer

195

questions, provide advice, feedback, and provide resources to complete their research project

196

(Figure 3A). Interns further described how mentors supported them in the summer research

197

experience by making themselves available to answer questions, provide feedback, and offer

198

mentorship beyond the program. Others described how their mentors were able to create a

199

positive learning environment. One intern stated:

200
201
202
203
204
205
206
207
208

He created such a friendly and informative atmosphere. My mentor was very engaging
and friendly during all our interactions, which definitely made me comfortable and
content with my internship. In addition, he was able to explain very complex ideas in
such a wonderful way! He started with the basics, then added fun anecdotes, until we
could finally fully understand the more complex material. This helped to keep my interest
level extremely high throughout all our interactions as well as during my independent
study. His passion definitely rubbed off on me!
Each intern rated the vSREC experience as good or excellent. All self-reported gaining a

209

greater appreciation for research, learning ethical conduct of research, and studying a topic in

210

depth. Fifty-five percent agreed or strongly agreed that they wanted to pursue a career in research

211

(Figure 3B). Interns found expert speakers to be the most enjoyable aspects of the vSREC,

212

followed by networking events. They appreciated the speakers sharing their research experiences

213

and the pathways they took in their careers to reach their goals. One intern described:

214
215
216
217
218

The most enjoyable aspect of the virtual summer research experience was being able to
hear all these different guest speakers who had such different paths that they followed to
achieve their goal. It was overwhelming and very encouraging to continue chasing my
dream after hearing all the bad experiences and setbacks that they experienced yet still
managed to overcome.

222

Interns also discussed the digital skills they learned during the virtual program and how

223

they planned to use these in the future. Interns discussed how many of the skills in Zoom,

224

Google Drive, and Canvas would assist them in college, particularly in online courses.

225

While the interns overwhelmingly enjoyed the virtual program, many discussed their

226

challenges and recommendations for future virtual programs. Nearly half of respondents

227

expressed a desire to have a hands-on research experience and felt it was difficult to sit in front

228

of their computer for several hours a day. Interns recommended having more activities that were

229

interactive to build rapport and engagement among interns and mentoring staff and to try to

230

match interns in a lab with others at their level of education.

The Research Preparation Scale was included on both the pre- and post-surveys to

232

evaluate interns’ perceptions of their ability to perform and conduct research after completing the

233

virtual program. Interns reported a significantly greater understanding of the research process

234

and in their preparation to conduct research. They also felt more able to analyze and interpret

235

data and improved skills in scientific writing. Lastly, interns reported a greater understanding of

236

how scientists conduct research, apply science to research, and apply the scientific method

techniques” and “asked appropriate questions” (Figure 5). No mentors felt that interns spent too

247

much time on other program activities, and 90% agreed/strongly agreed that program

248

requirements enhanced the experience. However, 30% of mentors felt that interns were not on

249

time or well prepared for Zoom meetings and commented anecdotally about varying levels of

Discussion

254

Program Outcomes: Summary

255

As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded in the USA, leading to lab hibernation in late

256

March 2020, IUSCCC program leaders prioritized creation of these alternatives to hands-on

257

research experiences. Due to stress associated with COVID-19, the abrupt closure of schools,

258

and the resulting loss of social networks, the leadership of vSREC had tepid expectations for the

16

259

program and expected student attrition. However, all but one student selected for the program

260

based on an interview before hibernation readily accepted the offer to participate in vSREC.

261

Moreover, each intern finished the program. The self-reported student and mentor outcomes

262

strongly suggest a high degree of satisfaction with the program. However, there is an opportunity

263

for further improvements, which are described below.

264

Lessons Learned: Mentors and Interns

265

The research mentors provided a crucial link to research projects, models of cancer

266

research career paths, and discipline-specific lecture topics, ensuring a cancer research focus was

267

maintained. In the future, we envision additional innovative virtual projects in the areas of

268

bioinformatics, image analysis, literature searches, and other in silico lab topics.

269

For interns, future plans might focus on professional communication. This training would

270

include how to create a calendar-based schedule, how to schedule meetings on a mentor’s

271

calendar, and professional etiquette for timeliness. Expectations related to intern-mentor

272

interactions during the course of the program may further improve program experience, mentor

273

satisfaction, and outcomes.

274

Lessons Learned: Program Implementation

275

Active participation of high school teachers was key to the success of this program, as

276

they applied their teaching and student-teacher interaction skills to keep interns engaged during

277

the entire program. They also designed the curriculum shared by all interns, providing a common

278

point of reference for all program participants. In the future, it will be valuable to draw on

279

teacher expertise to design tests of student knowledge pre- and post-program, to ensure that self-

280

reported learning achievements are supported by unbiased metrics.

281

Recruiting teachers for summer programs may pose a challenge in the future. Currently,

282

teachers are seeing fewer opportunities for professional development within their schools

283

because more time is being taken up to troubleshoot and prepare for the health and safety of the

284

students within the virtual and in-person teaching platforms. This, in turn, creates fewer

285

opportunities to enlist other strong teachers to help out with the summer program. A further

286

challenge is that teachers are working longer hours to develop virtual and in-person lessons to

287

accommodate the hybrid calendars created by most schools. This gives them less personal time

288

to participate in professional development activities such as the Teacher Research Program. In

289

the future, similar programs will need to consider innovative ways to recruit and retain strong

290

teachers to help facilitate these high school pipeline programs.

291

The undergraduate students of the Summer Team were an invaluable part of the program,

292

providing near-peer mentoring and technological support for online tools. The availability of

293

computing devices and a good internet connection is a limiting factor for any virtual program. In

294

an ideal program, tablets with cellular data connections would be made available to interns who

295

need them. Although using multiple learning management system (LMS) platforms allowed for

296

more comprehensive functionality than opting for a single standalone platform, this multi-

297

platform use caused confusion for the interns, as they often struggled to remember the purpose of

298

each platform. However, the benefits of this multi-platform method included access to the

299

different native tools within each platform. No one platform provides all of the features needed

300

to run a wholly virtual program. Still, training on integrating external platforms such as G Suite

301

and Zoom into a central LMS system such as Canvas can help reduce some of the confusion that

302

interns faced during the vSREC experience. Also, more comprehensive pre-program IT training

18

303

for all interns by a member of the institution’s educational IT support team could help better

304

prepare students for the upcoming program.

305

Future Directions

306

A current problem in education is how to engage students with limited mobility (i.e.,

307

long-term wheel-chair bound or temporary injury limited mobility students) in the laboratory

308

[24]. While the rehabilitation field has used adaptive sports as therapy [25], the adaptation of

309

equipment and research facilities has been less swift. The opportunities for virtual research

310

projects, such as those examples described here, offer a chance for meaningful engagement in

311

cancer research to interns previously hindered by limited mobility. As work from home and

312

telehealth becomes more accepted, we envision innovative opportunities to increase.

313

Conclusions

314

The IUSCCC SRP program typically gets >200 applications for 15-17 slots. Thus, many

315

students with interest in cancer research do not get the opportunity to participate. Further,

316

IUSCCC summer programs do not provide a residential option, so many students from rural

317

communities may be disadvantaged from participating. The virtual programs, however, offer the

318

opportunity to engage students beyond geographic proximity to National Cancer Institute-

319

designated cancer centers, particularly for those cancer centers that have entire states as their

320

catchment area. Thus, a program such as this, developed in response to COVID-19, can

321

potentially change the depth and breadth of cancer education. These impactful programs allow

322

cancer centers to engage with communities. Although we hope that IUSCCC will be in a position

323

to offer a hands-on laboratory experience in 2021, our virtual framework provides an appealing

324

and effective alternative if needed.
