Abstract

31

SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a major threat to global public health, resulting in global

32

societal and economic disruptions. Here, we investigate the intramolecular and

33

intermolecular RNA interactions of wildtype (WT) and a mutant (Δ382) SARS-CoV-2 virus in

34

cells using high throughput structure probing on Illumina and Nanopore platforms. We

35

identified twelve potentially functional structural elements within the SARS-CoV-2 genome,

36

observed that identical sequences can fold into divergent structures on different subgenomic

37

RNAs, and that WT and Δ382 virus genomes can fold differently. Proximity ligation

38

sequencing experiments identified hundreds of intramolecular and intermolecular pair-wise

39

interactions within the virus genome and between virus and host RNAs. SARS-CoV-2 binds

40

strongly to mitochondrial and small nucleolar RNAs and is extensively 2‘-O-methylated. 2‘-O-

41

methylation sites in the virus genome are enriched in the untranslated regions and are

42

associated with increased pair-wise interactions. SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a global

43

decrease of 2‘-O-methylation sites on host mRNAs, suggesting that binding to snoRNAs

44

could be a pro-viral mechanism to sequester methylation machinery from host RNAs

45

towards the virus genome. Collectively, these studies deepen our understanding of the

46

molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity, cellular factors important during infection and

47

provide a platform for targeted therapy.

Introduction

49

Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped viruses with positive-sense single-stranded RNA

50

genomes. They are widespread in animals and can cause mild to severe respiratory or

51

enteric disease in humans1,2. There are currently seven CoVs known to infect humans,

52

which include the four ―seasonal‖ human CoVs: OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU13, which can

53

cause mild cold-like symptoms and highly pathogenic CoVs: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and

54

SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV emerged in 2002 and resulted in more than 8,000 human

55

infections with case fatality rate of approximately 10%4. This was followed by the discovery

56

of MERS-CoV in 2012, which has resulted in more than 2,000 human infections and over

57

800 lethal cases with ongoing sporadic outbreaks in the Middle East 5. More recently, the

58

outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has caused unprecedented social and economic damage around

59

the world6. Since it was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has

60

resulted in over 90 million infections and more than 1.9 million deaths as of 13 th January

61

2021, according to WHO. Different variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been found to circulate

62

within patients. Viruses that contain deletions of various sizes in the ORF8 region has been

63

found around the world, including in Singapore, Taiwan, Bangladesh, Australia and Spain 7.

64

In particular, a 382-nucleotide deletion (Δ382) of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that truncates

65

ORF7 and deletes ORF8 was found in patients in Singapore8. While patients infected with

66

Δ382 virus showed less severe symptoms than those infected with WT viruses, the

67

molecular mechanisms behind virus attenuation in patients is unclear 7. It is hence imperative

68

to understand how SARS-CoV-2 and their variants function, in order to facilitate effective

69

surveillance, prevention and treatment strategies.

70
71

CoV genomes are among the largest of the RNA viruses, with lengths of 26-32 kb2. Upon

72

entry into the cell, the positive-sense genome is translated from two open reading frames

73

(ORF1a and ORF1b) and the resulting polyproteins are cleaved into non-structural proteins.

74

Non-structural proteins are essential for virus RNA replication that, in addition to new

75

genomes,

76

discontinuous transcription9. These RNAs, together with the full genome, can interact with

77

host cell proteins and RNAs to regulate virus infection. Like many other RNA viruses such as

78

dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), the SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA can fold into

79

secondary and tertiary structures that are essential for virus RNA replication and protein

80

translation10–13. Importantly, elements in the 5‘ and 3‘ untranslated regions (UTRs) have

81

been implicated in virus replication and protein synthesis14,15, and the frameshifting element

82

is important for ribosome slippage to enable the translation of ORF1ab16,17. However, how

83

the rest of the virus genomes folds into short- and long-range structures is still under-

84

studied. Here, we utilized different high throughput RNA and interactome techniques

85

(SHAPE-MaP18, PORE-cupine19 and SPLASH20) to comprehensively interrogate the

86

secondary structures and virus-host interactions along the wildtype (WT) and Δ382 SARS-

87

CoV-2 genomes to identify potentially functional structure elements along the virus genome

88

(Figure 1a). Using PORE-cupine, we identified sgRNA-specific structures as well as WT

89

and Δ382 specific structures using Nanopore direct RNA sequencing. The advantage of

90

long-read sequencing enables us to map our sequencing reads uniquely to each sgRNA,

91

without needing to average structure signals across all sgRNAs and full-length RNA in short-

92

read sequencing, due to ambiguous mapping. SPLASH further allows us to identify pair-

93

wise RNA interactions using proximity ligation and sequencing, deepening our knowledge of

94

how the genome folds along itself for function.

95
96

In addition to studying how the virus genome interacts with itself, determining how the virus

97

genome interacts with host RNAs in its cellular environment is another key to understanding

98

virus pathogenicity. Other RNA viruses, including the ZIKV, have been shown to directly

99

interact with host RNAs such as microRNAs to impact virus infection 11. Most host factor

100

studies for SARS-CoV-2 done to date have been focused on how the host proteins interact

101

with the virus proteins and genome; much less is known about how SARS-CoV-2 interacts

102

with host RNAs inside cells21–24. Here, we utilized SPLASH to identify host RNAs that

103

interact with the SARS-CoV-2 genome inside infected Vero cells (Figure 1a). We observed

104

that SARS-CoV-2 RNA interacts strongly with a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) SNORD27

105

and is 2‘-O-methylated inside cells. We further showed that 2‘-O-methylation of host RNAs

106

is decreased in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, and that virus-SNORD27 interaction could serve

107

as a mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 to facilitate host RNA degradation.

108
109

Results

110

SARS-CoV-2 RNA is highly structured in host cells.

111

To study the secondary structures of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs inside cells, we infected Vero cells

112

with WT and Δ382 SARS-CoV-2 and performed structure probing using the compound NAI

113

inside cells (Methods)10,25. We then performed mutational mapping (MaP) to determine the

114

location of high reactivity bases, indicating single-stranded bases, along the virus genome.

115

We confirmed that mutational rates along NAI-treated, denatured and DMSO-treated

116

samples are as expected (Supp. Figure 1a,b, Supp. Table 1). Biological replicates of

117

SARS-CoV-2 SHAPE-MaP show that the reactivities across replicates are highly

118

reproducible (Supp. Figure 1c), cover around 80% of the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome

119

(Figure 1b), and map to known structures in the 5‘ and 3‘UTR as expected (Supp. Figure

120

1d, Supp. Table 2). SHAPE-MaP reactivities were used to constrain RNA secondary

121

structure predictions to obtain accurate structure models of the entire SARS-CoV-2 genome

122

(Methods, Figure 1c,d, Figure 2)26. Our structure models are consistent with previously

123

identified structural elements in the 5‘ and 3‘UTRs (Figure 1c)27–29, existing structure models

124

for the frameshifting element (Figure 1d, Supp. Figure 2a) and that for TRS-L elements

125

(Supp. Figure 2b)27, confirming that models based on our data are accurate. Similar to

126

other RNA viruses like DENV and ZIKV, 57% of the bases in the SARS-CoV-2 genome are

127

predicted to be paired, with a median helix length of 5 bases in both WT and Δ382 genomes

128

(Supp. Figure 2c)10. These short helices enable RNA viruses to escape from host immune

129

responses.

130
131

To identify potentially functional structural RNA elements in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we

132

used a consensus model between WT and Δ382, incorporating local SHAPE reactivity, local

133

Shannon entropy of the structure models and local ‗Scan-Fold‘ energies in 150 nt windows

134

(Figure 2a)30,31. We evaluated window sizes of 50 nt to 300 nt which yielded consistent

135

results (Supp. Figure 3a). We considered a position a consensus candidate if it had at least

136

four out of six possible characteristics of ‗low average SHAPE‘ as an indication of

137

structuredness at a location, ‗low Shannon entropy‘ as an indication of structural consistency

138

and limited alternative folding, and ‗low Scan-Fold energy‘ as a proxy for high stability of

139

putative structural elements in both WT and Δ382 (Figure 2a). Local structure models of

140

consensus regions were largely consistent with structures obtained in the global context and

141

identified novel highly structured elements within the genome (Figure 2b). As single-

142

stranded regions present in the SARS-CoV-2 genome could be used for siRNA targeting, we

143

also identified locations with high reactivities (top 20%) in both the WT and Δ382 genomes

144

(Supp. Figure 3b).

targeting, to facilitate potential treatments for COVID-19 disease.

We identified a total of 21 regions that could be used for siRNA

146
147

SARS-CoV-2 genome contains hundreds of regions involved in intramolecular long-

148

range interactions

149

In addition to determining which bases are paired or unpaired in the SARS-CoV-2 genome,

150

we also wanted to know the identity of pairing partners within the genome. To identify pair-

151

wise RNA interactions, we treated SARS-CoV-2 or Δ382 infected Vero-E6 cells with

152

biotinylated psoralen and performed proximity ligation sequencing (SPLASH)20. Biological

153

replicates of SPLASH showed good correlation of pair-wise interactions between the

154

samples, indicating that our method is robust (Supp. Figure 4a,b).

155
156

We identified 237 and 187 intramolecular interactions along the WT and Δ382 genomes

157

respectively (Figure 3a, Supp. Tables 3,4). SPLASH pair-wise interaction patterns are

158

largely consistent between WT and Δ382 genomes, indicating the robustness of our method

159

(Figure 3a). 45.6% and 42.3% of the intramolecular interactions occur over distance longer

160

than 1kb in the WT and Δ382 genomes respectively, indicating that the viral sequences are

161

involved in extensive long-range interactions (Figure 3b, Supp. Figure 4c,d). Longer-range

162

interactions (>1kb) tend to have lower number of reads than shorter-range interactions,

163

indicating that they are formed more transiently inside cells (Figure 3c), consistent with

164

previous literature that longer-range interactions tend to be disrupted32. As RNA structures

165

could have an impact on regulation of virus gene expression, we examined whether RNA

166

pairing could be associated with translation using publicly available SARS-CoV-2 ribosome

167

profiling data. We observed that ribosome pause sites from cycloheximide experiments have

168

more pair-wise interactions than non-pause sites (Figure 3d)33, suggesting that RNA

169

structures could be associated with translational pauses and thus regulate the translation of

170

SARS-CoV-2.

171
172

Interestingly, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA exhibit more alternative interactions than

173

DENV and ZIKV RNAs inside the cell, with 55.6% and 48.1% of the WT and Δ382 pair-wise

174

interactions involving two or more partners (Figure 3e)10, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 RNA

175

takes on numerous conformations that are present simultaneously inside host cells. We

176

observed that a location at the 3‘ end of sgRNA N is particularly promiscuous and interacts

177

with regions throughout ORF1a (Figure 3f). Structure modelling of SPLASH identified

178

interactions using the program RNA-cofold revealed that energies calculated from the

179

predicted pairings are coherent with the SPLASH interaction counts (Figure 3g)34, indicating

180

that the relative abundance of SPLASH counts between different interactions could serve as

181

a proxy for the relative prevalence of these interactions inside cells.

182
183

SARS-CoV-2 sgRNAs are structurally different

184

In addition to the synthesis of the full-length genomes, a nested set of 3‘ co-terminal sgRNAs

185

are made in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells using discontinuous RNA synthesis9 (Supp. Figure

186

5a). These sgRNAs range from 2-8 kb long, contain a leader sequence and are produced at

187

different amounts. While SHAPE-MaP provides information on single nucleotide SHAPE

188

along the genome, short-read sequencing makes it difficult to map structure information

189

unambiguously to individual sgRNAs. As such, it is unclear if individual sgRNA contains

190

unique structures that are different from these in the full length RNA genome and in other

191

types of sgRNAs that could possibly be important for sgRNA-specific functions and

192

regulation of their replication and translation.

193
194

To address this, we utilize our previously developed method of coupling RNA structure

195

probing with Nanopore direct-RNA sequencing (PORE-cupine) to allow us to read out

196

SHAPE reactivities along long RNA molecules19. Sequencing of two biological replicates of

197

RNAs extracted from NAI-treated, WT and Δ382 SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells showed

198

good structure correlation, indicating that our data is reliable (Supp. Figure 5b,c). We also

199

confirmed that PORE-cupine reactivity shows good correlation with SHAPE-MaP reactivity

200

along the SARS-CoV-2 genome (Supp. Figure 5d). By filtering for the full length reads that

201

contain leader sequences, we determined reactivities along individual ORF3a, E, M, ORF6,

202

ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8 (WT only) and N transcripts (Figure 4a, Supp. Figure 6a, Supp.

203

Table 5). We observed that ORF7b RNA contains the highest average reactivities for both

204

WT and Δ382, suggesting that it is likely to be the most single-stranded among the different

205

sgRNAs of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 4b, Supp. Figure 6b). As structures around the leader

206

sequences for each sgRNA were previously shown to have weak correlations with gene

207

expression, we calculated the correlation between PORE-cupine reactivity around TRS-B

208

sites for each sgRNA and their relative abundance from our Nanopore data. We observe a

209

weak positive correlation between reactivity and transcript abundance, similar to previously

210

published literature28, for both WT and Δ382 sgRNAs, suggesting that single-strandedness

211

around the TRS-B region could result in increased synthesis of corresponding sgRNAs

212

(Figure 4c, Supp. Figure 6c).

213
214

To identify structures unique to each sgRNA, we compared the reactivities among individual

215

sgRNAs to identify highly consistent as well as divergent structural regions (Figure 4a,

216

Methods).

217

structure differences between different sgRNAs, 3 of which are also seen in the RNAs of

218

Δ382 sgRNAs (Supp. Figure 6a). While two regions centred around bases 27800 and

219

28250 correspond to the leader sequences of sgRNAs of ORF7b and N respectively, two

220

other structurally different regions (centred around 29300 and in 3‘UTR) are present within

221

all sgRNAs, and hence cannot be identified using short-read sequencing (Figure 4d,e,

222

Supp. Figure 6a,d,e). We checked that the regions that show diverse structures in different

223

sgRNAs also exhibit multiple interaction partners by SPLASH, confirming that those regions

224

do exist in alternative conformations (Figure 4f). We then visualized the sgRNA-specific

225

structures by incorporating PORE-cupine reactivities into structure modelling and observed

226

different structure models for the same sequence region in different sgRNAs (Figure 4g,

227

Supp. Figure 7a,b), further confirming that different sgRNAs could exist in different

228

structures despite sharing the same sequences.

We found 4 regions in RNAs of WT SARS-CoV-2 that showed consistent

Viruses that contain genomes with various ORF8 deletions have been found in patients

around the world7, however the mechanisms behind how such deletions impacts the virus

233

are still largely unknown. To determine whether virus phenotypes could be associated with

234

structural differences, we performed correlations of SHAPE-MaP reactivities between the

235

two genomes.

236

correlated (R=0.62, Supp. Figure 8a), although we do observe local structure differences at

237

the deletion region of around base 28000 (Supp. Figure 8b,c). SPLASH analysis around

238

the deletion region also revealed differences in pair-wise interactions between WT and

239

Δ382, confirming the local structure rearrangements between the two viruses (Supp. Figure

240

8d).

As expected, structures in WT and Δ382 genomes are generally highly

241
242

As the deletion occurs around base 28000 (ORF8), it is present not only in the full-length

243

genome but also in most of the sgRNAs (except for sgRNA of N, starts site of which is

244

located downstream of the deletion). Due to the extensive amount of sequence similarity

245

between the different sgRNAs, it is difficult to map uniquely to each individual sgRNA using

246

short-read sequencing. Consequently, it remained unclear whether the structure differences

247

between WT and Δ382 are present in all the sgRNAs or only between some specific

248

sgRNAs. To determine which sgRNA shows reactivity differences between WT and Δ382

249

genomes, we compared the PORE-cupine reactivity profiles of individual WT and Δ382

250

sgRNA to each other (Supp. Figure 9a). While we could only detect very local reactivity

251

differences immediately before and after the deletion site when all of the WT and Δ382

252

sgRNA reads are summed and compared to each other as an aggregate (similar reactivity

253

profiles obtained using short-read Illumina sequencing), we observed additional structure

254

differences when individual WT and Δ382 sgRNAs are compared to each other (Supp.

255

Figure 9a,b,c). We observed the largest structure differences between WT and Δ382 in

256

ORF3a and E sgRNAs (Supp. Figure 9a). We also consistently observed a second

257

structurally different region between WT and Δ382 sgRNAs at the bases 29200-29400

258

(Supp. Figure 9b,d), indicating that the deletion could impact distal structures that are

259

located more than 1kb away. As expected, we did not observe reactivity differences between

260

N-gene sgRNAs of WT and Δ382 viruses as this sgRNA is transcribed using TRS located

261

downstream of the deletion region. This finding indicates that the reactivity differences

262

between other sgRNAs of WT and Δ382 viruses are likely to occur in cis due to the deletion

263

and not due to factors that may act in trans (Supp. Figure 9a,b). As sgRNA of N is by far

264

the most abundant sgRNA of SARS-CoV-2 and it did not show structure differences

265

between WT and Δ382 viruses9, differences in the reactivity between the 29300 region in

266

WT and Δ382 genomes were masked when an aggregate reactivity of all sgRNAs is used

267

for comparison (Supp. Figure 9a,b). As such, using long-read sequencing to map RNA

268

structures across sgRNAs can yield novel insights into sgRNA-specific RNA structures.

SARS-CoV-2 genome interacts strongly with mitochondrial RNAs and snoRNAs

271

The genomes of RNA viruses can interact directly with host RNAs to facilitate or restrict viral

272

infection. By analysing the SPLASH interactions between SARS-CoV-2 and host cell RNAs,

273

we identified 374 and 334 host RNAs that interact with the WT and Δ382 SARS-CoV-2

274

genomes respectively (Figure 5a,b, Supp. Figure 10a,b, Supp. Tables 6,7). The host

275

RNA-virus genome interactions are preferentially enriched in the coding regions along host

276

mRNAs (Figure 5c). STRING analysis of the top 25% of SARS-CoV-2 interactors showed

277

that they are enriched for proteins that physically interact with each other (PPI: p<10-16)35,

278

including genes that are involved in the mitochondria, ER, GTP hydrolysis and translation

279

processes (Figure 5d).

280

enrichments, confirming the importance of SARS-CoV-2 interactors in mitochondrial and ER

281

function (Figure 5e)36,37.

GO term enrichment of interacting RNAs showed similar

282
283

While SARS-CoV-2 RNAs bind to more than 300 RNAs inside cells, we observed that the

284

top 10 (2.6%) of the strongest interactors contributed to 17.5% and 24.1% of all WT and

285

Δ382 binding events, indicating that the virus binds to them particularly strongly (Figure 5b).

286

These strong interactors include mitochondrial RNAs such as the mRNA of COX1, a

287

mitochondrially encoded cytochrome-c oxidase, mitochondrial rRNA, mRNA of ARHGDIA, a

288

Rho-GTPase signaling protein and SNORD27, a snoRNA responsible for 18S ribosomal

289

RNA methylation (Supp. Figure 10c). Previous study using RNA-GPS had shown that

290

SARS-CoV-2 is localized to the mitochondria and the nucleolus 38. SARS-CoV-2 infection

291

also results in mitochondrial dysregulation23,39. Further experiments are needed to test

292

whether the direct pairing between SARS-CoV-2 and mitochondrial RNAs contributes to

293

mitochondrial dysregulation.

294
295

SARS-CoV-2 infection has been found to have an impact on almost every aspect of the host

296

transcriptome to control virus and host gene regulation40. We observed a general decrease

297

of RNA abundance of SARS-CoV-2 interactors upon virus infection. Interestingly, however,

298

an opposite trend was observed for the strong interactors that were selectively stabilized and

299

their abundance increased (Figure 5f,g, Supp. Figure 10d,e). qRT-PCR analysis of key

300

interactors such as COX1 mRNA and MT-rRNA showed that these RNAs are indeed

301

stabilized upon virus infection, confirming our RNA sequencing results (Supp. Figure 10f-i).

302

Mining of published SARS-CoV-2 proteomics data revealed that proteins encoded by SARS-

303

CoV-2 interactors were also preferentially translated and/or stabilized at the protein level as

304

compared to proteins produced by non-SARS-CoV-2 interactors (Figure 5h)41. Thus,

305

interaction with SARS-CoV-2 RNAs may confer a stabilizing effect on their overall gene

306

regulation.

307
308

SARS-CoV-2 RNA binds to SNORD27 and is 2’-O-methylated.

309

SNORD27 is one of the strongest host interaction partners for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (Figure

310

6a) and is traditionally known to guide 2‘-O-methylation of 18S ribosomal RNA42. As

311

snoRNAs can bind and methylate cellular RNAs43, and methylation enzymes including

312

fibrillarin (FBL), rRNA methyltransferase 2 and 3 (MRM2 and MRM3) have been found to be

313

physically associated with SARS-CoV-2 genome23, we tested whether SARS-CoV-2 RNA

314

could be 2‘-O-methylated and whether host RNAs‘ methylation levels are changed upon

315

virus infection. We performed 2 biological replicates of Nm-seq on total RNA from Hela cells,

316

as well as from uninfected and SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero-E6 cells (Supp. Figure 11a,

317

Supp. Tables 8,9, Methods)44. Biological replicates of Nm-seq from both cell types show

318

that they are well correlated, suggesting that Nm-seq data is reproducible (Supp. Figure

319

11b,c). Nm-seq analysis on human 18S rRNA accurately identified 36 out of 42 known 2‘-O-

320

methylation sites and had a high AUC-ROC curve of 0.96, suggesting that we are able to

321

detect existing 2‘-O-methylation sites accurately and sensitively (Supp. Figure 11d,e).

322
323

Using Nm-seq, we identified a total of 130 2‘-O-methylation sites in SARS-CoV-2 genome

324

(Figure 6b), and 4,931 sites in 4,142 transcripts in the Vero transcriptome (Supp. Figure

325

11f,g). We observed that a 2‘-O-methylated host mRNA contains approximately 1.1

326

modifications per transcript in the Vero transcriptome, similar to methylated RNAs in Hela

327

cells44. The majority of these host modification sites (60%) were located in the coding

328

regions and were enriched for codons encoding charged amino acids (Supp. Figure 12a),

329

as previously described44. In comparison, SARS-CoV-2 genome is 19X more modified than

330

host mRNAs after normalizing for transcript length (Figure 6c). The 2‘-O-methylations are

331

enriched in the 5‘ and 3‘UTRs of SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 6d), depleted in position 2 of codons

332

(Supp. Figure 12b), and are enriched for U and depleted for G bases along the genome

333

(Figure 6e). 2‘-O-methylation sites on SARS-CoV-2 are also associated with high SPLASH

334

reads, indicating that they are located near positions with abundant intramolecular pair-wise

335

interactions (Figure 6f).

336
337

As the modification of SARS-CoV-2 genome might sequester corresponding RNA

338

modification enzymes away from the host transcriptome, we calculated the changes in

339

modification rates in the host RNAs in the presence and absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

340

We observed a decrease in host RNA 2‘-O-methylation frequency upon virus infection,

341

supporting our hypothesis that they become less methylated (Figure 6g). In addition, we

342

also observed that host RNAs that interact strongly with SARS-CoV-2 genome show greater

343

2‘-O-methylation changes, and show large losses and gains in modification sites within the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.17.427000; this version posted January 19, 2021. The copyright holder for this

344

RNAs (Figure 6h,i, Supp. Figure 12c). We hypothesized that RNAs interacting with SARS-

345

CoV-2 genome could be methylated near their interacting regions, presumably due to

346

proximity to SNORD27, while methylation sites that are located far away could be lost. To

347

determine whether 2‘-O-methylation sites on SARS-CoV-2 genome interacting RNAs are

348

closer to the locations of virus-RNA interactions regions, we calculated the closest distance

349

between virus-host interaction to host 2‘-O-methylation site. We observed that sites that had

350

2‘-O-methylation were indeed closer to virus-host RNA interactions sites (Figure 6j),

351

supporting the hypothesis that proximity to SARS-CoV-2 genome might allow interacting

352

RNAs to be methylated together within a hub.

353
354

2‘-O-methylation has been shown to stabilize RNA gene expression inside cells43. Therefore,

355

we hypothesized that the loss of 2‘-O-methylation on host RNA upon virus infection may

356

facilitate host RNA decay. Indeed, we observed that the abundance of host RNAs that show

357

a decrease in methylation sites was significantly decreased in infected cells. In contrast, the

358

abundance of host RNAs that show an increase in methylation sites was increased (Figure

359

6k). Thus, together with the production of NSP-1 from SARS-CoV-2 to cleave cellular RNAs,

360

the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs to SNORD27 could serve as part of a multi-prong

361

mechanism to degrade cellular RNAs and maximize virus replication (Figure 6l)45.

362
363

Discussion

364

Studying the molecular basis of virus pathogenicity enables us to understand how this can

365

be counteracted and how to inhibit and target the replicating virus. By probing the local and

366

pair-wise RNA interactions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome and sgRNAs using high throughput

367

structure probing technologies on both the Illumina and Nanopore sequencing platforms, we

368

identified potentially functional structure elements within the genome and demonstrated that

369

these RNA structures are associated with ribosome pausing. While the structures along

370

SARS-CoV-2 have also been probed using other short-read high throughput strategies such

371

as DMS-sequencing29, these strategies have limitations in their ability to decipher sgRNA-

372

specific structures due to extensive sequence similarity between the different sgRNAs.

373

Using long-read sequencing, we identified both sgRNA-specific structures, as well as

374

structure differences between WT and Δ382 genomes, that could serve as a basis for

375

understanding sgRNA-specific functions in future.

376
377

While existing literature has mostly focused on understanding SARS-CoV-2: host protein

378

interactions, here we describe that the virus genomes bind directly to hundreds of host

379

RNAs inside cells using SPLASH. In addition to a previous report that showed that SARS-

380

CoV-2 binds to snRNAs that are involved in splicing46, we identified diverse, functionally

381

related, host mRNA-virus interactions and found that SARS-CoV-2 binds particularly strongly

382

to mitochondrial RNAs and snoRNAs. Our results are consistent with previous predictions of

383

SARS-CoV-2 localization in the mitochondria and nucleolus38, and the observation that the

384

mitochondria is dysregulated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection23. In addition, previous studies

385

have also shown that SNORD27 and mitochondrial RNAs are enriched on SARS-CoV-2

386

using formaldehyde crosslinking, and sequencing23. However, it is unclear if these RNAs

387

bind to the genome directly or indirectly through protein interactions. Our studies show that

388

SARS-CoV-2 RNA pairs directly with mitochondrial RNAs and snoRNAs at specific locations

389

on host RNAs and SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

390

modifications on their target RNAs, we additionally observed that SARS-CoV-2 genome is

391

extensively 2‘-O-methylated inside cells. This deepens our functional understanding of

392

SARS-CoV-2 biology from the previous observation that SARS-CoV-2 interacts with

393

methylation enzymes, including FBL, inside cells.

As snoRNAs recruit 2‘-O-methylation

394
395

2‘-O-methylation of RNA plays important roles inside cells and can contribute to RNA

396

stabilization as well as key functions in innate immunity47. A recent study revealed that HIV-1

397

hijacks cellular proteins to 2‘-O-methylate its genome to escape from host innate immune

398

sensing by modulating the expression of type-1 interferons48. Further experiments are

399

needed to determine if 2‘-O-methylation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA could also allow it to escape

400

host immunity. Another hypothesis for the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to SNORD27 is that the

401

virus sequesters SNORD27 and methylation complexes towards itself and away from the

402

rest of the Vero cell transcriptome. We observed that 2‘-O-methylation sites on SARS-CoV-2

403

are enriched for paired interactions, in agreement with previous literature that 2‘-O-

404

methylation in HIV stabilizes alternative pairing conformation of the transactivation response

405

element49. Importantly, we observed that 2‘-O-methylation levels decrease in host RNAs

406

after SARS-CoV-2 infection, supporting our hypothesis that the binding of SNORD27 to

407

SARS-CoV-2 could direct methylation enzymes to SARS-CoV-2, and away from host RNAs.

408

In addition to the function of SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 to degrade host RNAs45, this could serve

409

as part of a multi-prong strategy for the virus to degrade host RNA for its own survival.

410

Further experiments would be needed to definitively prove this hypothesis.

411
412

In summary, our study identifies new potentially functional structures along the SARS-CoV-2

413

virus, new host factors and alternations of host gene regulation upon SARS-CoV-2 infection,

414

providing critical new understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity.

African green monkey kidney, clone E6 (Vero-E6) cells (ATCC# CRL-1586) were maintained

420

in Dulbecco‘s modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum

421

(5% FBS). SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (WX56) and ∆382 mutant (CA001) were isolated from

SHAPE-MaP structure probing of SARS-CoV-2 virus in Vero E6 cells

425

Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV-2 viruses (WT and Δ382) at a multiplicity of

426

infection (MOI) = 0.01 for 1 h at 37°C. Following 1 h infection, virus inoculum was removed

427

and replaced with DMEM-5% FBS. Flasks were incubated for 48 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.

428

At 48 hpi, cells were washed once with PBS and trypsin was added to detach the cells from

429

the flask. The cells were collected and centrifuged at 2000 rpm. The pellet was resuspended

430

in PBS and the cells were then separated into three reactions: (1) added 1:20 volume of 1M

431

NAI (03-310, Merck, 25 µl of NAI in 500 µl of infected cells) and incubated for 15 min at 37

432

°C for structure probing; (2) added 1:20 volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and incubated

433

for 15 min at 37 °C, as negative control; and (3) set aside a third portion of the infected cells

434

without any treatment, for the denaturing control in the downstream library preparation

435

process. The total RNA was extracted from the cells using E.Z.N.A. Total RNA Kit (Omega

436

437

following the SHAPE-MaP protocol to generate cDNA libraries compatible for Illumina

Nm-Seq library construction

To map RNA nucleotides with 2‘-O-methyl modification, Nm-Seq51 was applied to total RNA

nucleotides resist the OED and make the 3‘ end of reads enriched at the 2‘-O-methylation

464

sites. Two biological replicates of SARS-Cov-2 infected Vero E6 (total 4 replicates) and

465

uninfected Vero E6 (total 2 replicates) were used to generate Nm-Seq libraries. Ten ug of

Analysis of SHAPE-MaP experiments

472

Sequencing reads obtained from two replicates of SHAPE experiments were aligned with

473

the respective sequences for the strains (WT: EPI_ISL_407987, Δ382: EPI_ISL_414378)

474

and SHAPE values for each position calculated using ‗Shapemapper-2.15‘ of Weeks et al52.

475

Read depths obtained in the sequencing experiments allowed for conclusive determination

476

of SHAPE reactivites at approximately 80% of positions. A reference alignment of WT and

477

Δ382 sequences was obtained using ‗mafft-7.453‘ with the L-INS-I strategy. Subsequently,

478

local correlation of SHAPE reactivity between replicates and between WT and Δ382 was

479

calculated using Pearson correlation. As Pearson correlation between replicates was >0.9,

480

replicates were pooled for subsequent analysis.

481
482

Modeling of global RNA structure

483

Using the above SHAPE reactivities and reference sequences, separate global RNA

484

structure models for WT and Δ382 using ‗Superfold‘ with a maximum base pairing distance

485

of 600 nt, and default SHAPE slope (1.8) and intercept (-0.6) parameters53. Particular

486

regions of interest such as the frame-shift element were modelled separately in a local

487

context to search for pseudoknot structures using the ‗RNAstructure‘ tools ‗partition-smp‘

488

and ‗ProbKnot-smp‘.

Modeling of individual subgenomic RNA structure from Nanopore data

491

The distributions of mutation rates obtained from Nanopore RNA sequencing were

492

compared with the distribution of SHAPE reactivity values from short-read based

493

experiments described above. We found that a scale factor of 100 brings the mutation rate

494

distribution from the Nanopore experiment in line with distribution observed for conventional

495

SHAPE experiments. Hence, we applied this scaling factor and then employed these as

496

SHAPE data in the same ‗Superfold‘ protocol as for the full-length models described

497

above53.

498
499

PORE-cupine analysis of direct RNA sequencing data

500

Filtering for full-length sub-genomic RNA: To separate full length aligned reads into their

501

sub-genomic transcripts, we used two filtering conditions for all sgRNAs except for ORF6: 1,

502

The aligned reads need to contain the leader sequence, 2. The aligned positions after the

503

leader sequence must fall within ± 100 of the annotated sub-genomic sequences. For ORF6,

504

we had to extend the second filter to -300 of the annotated sub-genomic sequence.

505
506

We calculated the reactivity for each subgenomic transcript by using PORE-cupine, with two

507

adjustments to the analysis. 1. The length filter was removed, as only full-length transcripts

508

were used for the analysis. 2. To reduce the amount of computing resources required,

509

20000 strands from each subgenomic transcripts in the unmodified libraries were randomly

510

selected and used for the generation of models.

511
512

To determine the differences between reactivity, Wilcoxon Rank Sum test was applied to a

513

101 bases window with a step size of 25 nucleotides. Reactivity differences were compared

514

across shared sequences between the different subgenomic transcripts within each strain

515

(WT or Δ382), and across the two different strains. For the comparison between WT and

516

Δ382 genome, the region in the WT strain that was not present in the Δ382 strain was

517

masked. The p-values are corrected with Hommel's method. In addition to using the

518

statistical test to determine the differences, we added a second criteria of Pearson

519

correlation < 0.7.

520
521

Analysis of SPLASH experiments

522

Chimeric reads were divided into host-host, host-virus and virus-virus interactions for WT

523

and Δ382 genomes. Virus-virus interactions were normalized to total virus-virus interactions

524

and are shown in Figure 3A (WT: blue, Δ382: red). Virus-host interactions were equally

525

normalized and the main locations for host interactions are shown in Figure 5B.

Protein-protein interaction network analysis by STRING

528

The top 25% of host RNA interactors with SARS-CoV-2 were used as input for STRING

529

analysis35, a search tool for retrieval of interacting genes to acquire protein-protein

530

interaction (PPI) networks. The networks were built based on high confidence (0.7) evidence

531

from protein-protein interaction sources of experiments, databases and text-mining where

532

the line thickness indicates the strength of data support. Functional clusters in PPI networks

533

were determined using Markov Clustering algorithm (MCL). The PPI enrichment p-value <

534

1.0e-16.

535
536

Nm-Seq bioinformatics analysis

537

We referred to the pipeline from published protocol with some modifications51. The adaptors

538

on raw reads were trimmed using Cutadapt and the reads without 3‘ adaptors were

539

discarded54. The PCR duplication reads were filtered out by the pentamers at 5‘ and 3‘ end

540

of the reads as barcode using a custom script. The pentamers were then removed and

541

reads that are shorter than 15 nt were discarded. The reads that passed all these filters were

542

mapped to the reference which combined the longest transcriptome of Chlorocebus sabaeus

543

(ensembl ChlSab1.1.101) and SARS-CoV-2 sequence (WT_EPI_ISL_407987s) by bwa-

544

aln55. The multiple mapped reads and reads with soft and hard clipped alignments were

545

discarded. The depth of each position on the transcriptome using 3‘ end of reads were

546

calculated in both input control and OED enriched libraries (Dinput, DOED). The depths were

547

normalized by the read counts of each transcript. The significantly enriched sites over the

548

other regions on the same transcript were detected by ∆D = DOED - Dinput using Z-test (FDR

549

<0.05, DOED >=10, DOED/Dinput > 1.5).

550
551

As the SARS-CoV-2 transcripts comprise of 16~30% of the total reads, we subsampled the

552

two uninfected libraries into 4 libraries containing same reads on host transcriptome with the

553

4 infected replicates respectively, to compare the Nm sites of host transcriptome fairly.

554

Bases that show 2‘-O-methylation enrichment in 3 out of 4 replicates were recognized as the

555

2‘-O-methylation sites.
