Abstract

17

Critically ill COVID-19 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 display signs of generalized

18

hyperinflammation. Macrophages trigger inflammation to eliminate pathogens and repair tissue,

19

but this process can also lead to hyperinflammation and resulting exaggerated disease. The role of

20

macrophages in dysregulated inflammation during SARS-CoV-2 infection is poorly understood.

21

We used SARS-CoV-2 infected and glycosylated soluble SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 subunit (S1)

22

treated THP-1 human-derived macrophage-like cell line to clarify the role of macrophages in pro-

23

inflammatory responses. Soluble S1 upregulated TNF-α and CXCL10 mRNAs, and induced

24

secretion of TNF-α from THP-1 macrophages. While THP-1 macrophages did not support

25

productive SARS-CoV-2 replication, virus infection resulted in upregulation of both TNF-α and

26

CXCL10 genes. Our study shows that S1 is a key viral component inducing inflammatory response

27

in macrophages, independently of virus replication. Thus, virus-infected or soluble S1-activated

1. Introduction

33

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of

34

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Severely ill COVID-19 patients display lung tissue

35

damage associated with cell death and pathologic inflammation1,2 linked to enhanced pro-

36

inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels (e.g., TNF-α and CXCL10)3,4. These pathologies are

37

compatible with dysregulated inflammatory response characteristic of cytokine release syndrome

38

or macrophage-activation syndrome5 and generalized hyperinflammation6. These patients often

progress to respiratory failure due to complications from hyperinflammation and require

40

mechanical ventilation. Analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from critically ill

41

COVID-19 patients revealed upregulation of inflammatory cytokine signatures, indicating influx

42

of active inflammatory macrophages in the airways7,8. Single-cell RNA sequencing also detected

43

SARS-CoV-2 RNA in BALF-associated macrophages8, whereas virus antigen was detected in

44

subsets of tissue-resident and lymph node-associated macrophages9. Macrophages mediate

45

inflammatory responses following infection, migrating to affected tissue to eliminate invading

46

pathogens. These findings implicate macrophages in the exaggerated inflammatory response

47

during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we analyzed pro-inflammatory response against

48

SARS-CoV-2 and soluble SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 subunit in the human-derived THP-

49

1 macrophage cell-line.

2. Results and Discussion

53

2.1. Soluble SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit induces inflammatory response in THP-1

54

cells

55

Reports using non-soluble SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike (S) glycoprotein10 and purified S1 subunit

56

produced in E.coli11 suggest that the S protein activates inflammation in macrophages. Prefusion

57

trimeric S is cleaved by cellular proteases12 that dissociate the S1 subunit during virion assembly13

58

or after engagement of the ACE2 receptor14. Trimeric S is transient on the surface of virions, and

59

constructs designed to stabilize this conformation do not reflect the dynamic state of the S

60

glycoprotein and subunits in contact with cells. Importantly, dissociated S1 may remain engaged

61

to cell receptors and stimulate yet undefined effects. Furthermore, S1 is glycosylated at numerous

62

positions15 that mediate functions such as shielding of viral epitopes. Glycosylation patterns are

63

not recapitulated in E.coli used to purify proteins and thus, non-glycosylated S1 produced in E.coli

64

may not reproduce the biological effects of SARS-CoV-2 S1.

65
66

To clarify the role of S1 in proinflammatory responses in macrophages, we tested whether

67

glycosylated, soluble SARS-CoV-2 S1 produced in mammalian cells induced expression of pro-

68

inflammatory and antiviral cytokines. We evaluated expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines

69

TNF-α, CXCL10 and IFN-γ16,17 due to their association with hyperinflammation in COVID-19

70

patients, and the antiviral cytokine IFN-β since it restricts SARS-CoV-2 infection16. While S1 did

71

not induce gene expression of antiviral IFN-β (Fig.1A) or IFN-γ (Fig.1B) in THP-1 macrophages,

72

expression of proinflammatory TNF-α (Fig.1C) and CXCL10 (Fig. 1D) was upregulated following

73

exposure to S1. TNF-α was upregulated by 30-fold at 4h post treatment with S1 (p < 0.05) and

74

remained upregulated by two-fold at 16h post treatment (Fig. 1C). CXCL10 expression was

75

consistently upregulated by 3 to 8-fold in THP-1 macrophages exposed to S1 up to 16h post

76

treatment (p<0.05) (Fig. 1D). Although macrophages respond to IFN-γ by producing CXCL10,

77

they are not substantial sources of IFN-γ18, which is mostly produced by lymphocytes to recruit

78

macrophages to infection sites19. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 S1 upregulated CXCL10 independently of

79

IFN-γ, similar to LPS20 and TNF-α21.

80

We further examined release of TNF-α from THP-1 macrophages treated with the SARS-CoV-2

81

S1 subunit. Treatment with S1 increased secretion of TNF-α in macrophages up to 30 times more

82

than vehicle-treated controls at 4h post treatment (p< 0.05) (Fig. 1E). These results demonstrated

83

that soluble S1 alone suffices to activate inflammatory response in macrophages independently of

84

full-length S protein, S-trimers and virus infection. Non-glycosylated S1 from E.coli induced TNF4

85

α secretion in murine macrophages11. Although these studies were conducted in mouse

86

macrophages11, non-glycosylated S1 may expose sites able to trigger pro-inflammatory response,

87

which are cryptic in the glycosylated S1 protein. By utilizing physiologically relevant glycosylated

88

S1 derived from mammalian cells, we demonstrate its pro-inflammatory activity in human

89

macrophages.

2.2. Inflammatory response in SARS-CoV-2 infected THP-1 macrophages in the absence of
productive viral replication

92

Since SARS-CoV-2 S1 induced pro-inflammatory response in macrophages independently of

93

virus infection or replication (Fig. 1), we next evaluated pro-inflammatory response and viral

94

replication in THP-1 macrophages infected with SARS-CoV-2. As expected, infection with SARS-

95

CoV-2 in susceptible Vero E6 cells led to exponential increase of viral nucleocapsid (N) (Fig. 2A)

96

and S (Fig. 2B) genes. In contrast, expression of N (Fig. 2C) and S (Fig. 2D) genes was reduced

97

in THP-1 macrophages over the course of infection. Virus replication and release of infectious

98

progeny was determined by TCID50 assay in supernatants from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells to

99

corroborate viral RNA findings. While infected Vero E6 cells supported robust release of

100

infectious virions due to productive replication, infectious virus production from infected THP-1

101

cells became undetectable after 8h post-infection (Fig. 2E). Finally, THP-1 macrophages did not

102

develop cytopathic effects (CPE) following SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas Vero E6 cells

103

displayed progressive monolayer damage over the course of infection (Fig. 2F). These results

104

indicate that THP-1 human macrophages do not support productive replication of SARS-CoV-2.

105

Our study is in accord with a report showing non-productive replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human

106

monocyte-derived macrophages and DCs22.

107

Despite non-productive replication, expression of TNF-α (Fig. 2G) and CXCL10 (Fig. 2H) in

108

THP-1 macrophages infected with SARS-CoV-2 was significantly upregulated by 2- and 3-fold at

109

4 and 24 hpi, respectively. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 infection did not induce IFN-β (Fig.2I) or

110

IFN-γ (Fig. 2J) expression in THP-1 macrophages, whereas LPS upregulated both cytokines by

111

80- and 3-fold, respectively. Since both TNF-α and CXCL10 are key pro-inflammatory cytokines,

112

our results suggest low-grade pro-inflammatory response in THP-1 macrophages infected with

113

SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of productive virus replication. However, SARS-CoV-2 infection did

114

not prompt type-I interferon dependent antiviral response in these cells.

115
116

Macrophages promote pro-inflammatory responses by producing cytokines and chemokines that

117

initiate and sustain inflammation. The role of macrophages in SARS-CoV-2 infection remains

118

unclear despite their function as pro-inflammatory cells and contribution to immune dysregulation.

119

Our study shows that although THP-1 macrophages do not support productive virus replication,

120

infection with SARS-CoV-2 upregulates expression of pro-inflammatory mediators linked to

121

generalized hyperinflammation in COVID-19 patients4,23. Our study identifies the SARS-CoV-2

122

soluble S1 subunit as a viral factor involved in activation of pro-inflammatory response in

123

macrophages. The soluble S1 subunit triggers pro-inflammatory response in non-infected

124

macrophages and therefore, interaction with the S1 subunit suffices to induce this response

125

independently of virus infection. Extracellular soluble S1 originating from infected lung epithelial

126

cells may interact with uninfected macrophages to stimulate inflammation. Shedding of

127

dissociated S1 has been shown during expression of the entire S protein on the surface of

128

pseudoviruses14 and in mammalian cells24. Our study raises the possibility that cell-free soluble S1

129

engages with non-infected macrophages to induce low-grade pro-inflammatory response. SARS-

130

CoV-2 infection in THP-1 macrophages does not lead to CPE (indicative of cell death) or

131

productive viral replication, while low-grade inflammatory response remains upregulated for at

132

least 24 hours after SARS-CoV-2 exposure (Fig. 2H). Therefore, virus-infected or S1-activated

140

Cells and virus: Cell cultures were maintained at 37C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Vero E6 cells

141

(ATCC; catalog no. CRL-1586) were cultured in DMEM medium (Gibco 12430062)

142

supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml Penicillin and 100 µg/ml Streptomycin. Human

143

monocyte-like cells, THP-1 cell line (ATCC; catalog no. TIB-202), were cultured in RPMI 1640

144

medium (Gibco 21870076) supplemented with 10% FBS, 10mM HEPES, 1mM sodium pyruvate,

145

50µM of beta-mercaptoethanol, 100 IU/ml Penicillin and 100 µg/ml Streptomycin. SARS-CoV-

146

Cell infection: THP-1 monocyte-like cells were seeded in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate

153

13-acetate (PMA, 100ng/mL) to induce differentiation into macrophages. After 24 hours of

154

incubation, undifferentiated cells were washed away and remaining differentiated macrophages

155

were incubated in fresh media without PMA for an additional 24 hours. THP-1 cells were either

156

mock infected with supernatants from non-infected Vero E6 cells or inoculated at an MOI of 0.5

157

for 1 hour at 37C with virus stock generated in Vero E6 cells. Cells were washed once with PBS

158

and incubated at 37oC in complete media for the indicated times. Vero E6 cells were seeded and

159

incubated for 24 hours before virus infection at an MOI of 0.1 following the same procedure as

160

with THP-1 cells. After indicated times, culture supernatants were collected for titration assays

161

(TCID50) and RNA was extracted from infected cells using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen; catalog

162

no. 74134) following manufacturer’s instructions. RNA extracted from THP-1 cells treated with

163

100ng/mL of LPS (Invivogen, catalog no. tlrl-eklps) for 4 hours was used as a control.

167

8nM (0.6µg/mL) of recombinant soluble SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein purified from HEK293

168

cells (SinoBiological; catalog no. 40591-V08H-B) or an equivalent volume of vehicle control for
