Abstract
The ongoing global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) calls for an urgent
development of effective and safe prophylactic and therapeutic measures. Severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) glycoprotein is a major
immunogenic and protective protein, and plays a crucial role in viral pathogenesis. In this study,
we successfully constructed a synthetic codon-optimized DNA-based vaccine as a
countermeasure against SARS-CoV-2; denoted as VIU-1005. The design was based on the
synthesis of codon-optimized coding sequence for optimal mammalian expression of a consensus
full-length S glycoprotein. The successful construction of the vaccine was confirmed by
restriction digestion and sequencing, and the protein expression of the S protein was confirmed
by western blot and immunofluorescence staining in mammalian cells. The immunogenicity of
the vaccine was tested in two mouse models (BALB/c and C57BL/6J). Th1-skewed systemic Sspecific IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were significantly induced in both
models four weeks post three injections with 100 µg of the VIU-1005 vaccine via intramuscular
needle injection but not intradermal or subcutaneous routes. Importantly, such immunization
induced long-lasting IgG response in mice that lasted for at least 6 months. Interestingly, using a
needle-free system, we showed an enhanced immunogenicity of VIU-1005 in which lower doses
such as 25-50 μg or less number of doses were able to elicit significantly high levels of Th1biased systemic S-specific IgG antibodies and nAbs via intramuscular immunization compared
to needle immunization. Compared to the intradermal needle injection which failed to induce any
significant immune response, intradermal needle-free immunization elicited robust Th1-biased
humoral response similar to that observed with intramuscular immunization. Furthermore,
immunization with VIU-1005 induced potent S-specific cellular response as demonstrated by the

significantly high levels of IFN-γ, TNF and IL-2 cytokines production in memory CD8+ and
CD4+ T cells in BALB/c mice. Together, our results demonstrate that the synthetic VIU-1005
candidate DNA vaccine is highly immunogenic and capable of inducing long-lasting and Th1skewed immune response in mice. Furthermore, we show that the use of needle-free system
could enhance the immunogenicity and minimize doses needed to induce protective immunity in
mice, supporting further preclinical and clinical testing of this candidate vaccine.

Introduction
Since its emergence in December 2019, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
has caused more than 90 million infections with more than 2,000,000 deaths worldwide, as of
January 15, 2020. The causative agent of COVID-19 was identified to be a novel
betacoronavirus (beta-CoV) now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) (Zhu et al., 2020; Lu et al., 2020). Similar to other human coronaviruses, such as
the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV, a zoonotic
origin of SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested but has not yet been confirmed (Lu et al., 2020; Wu
et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 can infect individuals from different age groups and causes a wide
spectrum of disease manifestations. Most patients with COVID-19 are either asymptomatic or
have mild symptoms including fever, myalgia and cough. However, some patients can suffer
from moderate to severe life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with
possible fatal outcomes (Rodriguez-Morales et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2020). The
high human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 poses a major challenge toward controlling
its spread (Adhikari et al., 2020; Bai et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020).

Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded ~30 kb RNA genome,
which encodes four structural proteins including the surface spike (S) glycoprotein, the envelope
(E) protein, the membrane (M), and the nucleocapsid (N). It also encodes 16 nonstructural
proteins (nsp1-16) as well as putative and known accessory proteins involved viral replication
and pathogenesis (Jin et al., 2020; Fehr and Perlman, 2015; Tan et al., 2005). The viral S protein
is capable of inducing a strong immune response. It is comprised of S1 and S2 subunits in which
S1 in involved in binding to Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on host cells and

S2 being involved in viral-host membranes fusion (Yan et al., 2020; Du et al., 2009). Therefore,
neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) mainly function through targeting the receptor binding domain
(RBD) in the S1 subunit and preventing viral entry in host cells. Indeed, a strong association
between the magnitude of anti-S nAbs response and patient survival was recently shown in
COVID-19 patients (Sun et al., 2020). Furthermore, the recently approved vaccines for
emergency use against SARS-CoV-2 including either mRNA- or adenovirus-based vaccines also
target the S protein of the virus. Such work as well as other studies on MERS-CoV and SARSCoV suggest that viral S protein could represent the main target for the development of vaccines
against SARS-CoV-2 (Prompetchara et al., 2020; Fukushi et al., 2018; Fukushi et al., 2006). This
is further supported by the isolation and development of several therapeutic human nAbs against
the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and their ability to neutralize and block viral entry and/or cell-cell
spread at very low concentrations, and sometimes to confer prophylactic and therapeutic
protection in animals and humans (Papageorgiou and Mohsin, 2020; Hussen et al., 2020).

The ideal strategy for rapidly controlling existing and potential SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks is to
develop a safe and effective vaccine. Several vaccines candidates based on full-length or
truncated S protein are being developed and investigated including DNA vaccines, RNA
vaccines, replicating or non-replicating viral vectored vaccines, nanoparticle-based vaccine,
whole inactivated vaccine (WIV), and S or RBD protein-based subunit vaccines (Zhang et al.,
2020; Dong et al., 2020; Krammer., 2020). Many of these vaccines are at the late stages of the
clinical trials and/or approved for emergency use in several countries.

Synthetic DNA vaccine is a fast and an easy platform for the production of vaccines compared to
other vaccine development technologies due to their simple design, timely production,
manufacturing scalability and easy and well-established quality control in addition to their
temperature stability (Williams et al., 2013). In addition, DNA vaccines can elicit Th1-biased
immune response in contrast to other vaccine platforms such as protein-based subunit vaccines
which could induce the undesired Th2-skewed response in the case of coronaviruses (Tseng et
al., 2012; Agrawal et al., 2016).

Our previous work showed that DNA vaccines expressing MERS-CoV S1 or full-length S
glycoprotein can induce Th1-skewed immune response, nAbs and S-specific T cell response in
immunized mice. In this work, we built on our previous experience in developing DNA vaccines
for influenza (Hashem et al., 2012) and MERS-CoV (Alamri et al., 2017) to develop a synthetic
codon-optimized DNA vaccine as a countermeasure to aid in controlling SARS-CoV-2 spread.
Using a plasmid DNA vector suitable for clinical development (pVAX1), here we describe the
design and report the results from our preclinical immunogenicity testing of this vaccine
candidate, which is denoted as VIU-1005. The design of the VIU-15 vaccine candidate was
based on the synthesis of codon-optimized coding sequence for optimal mammalian expression
of a consensus full-length S glycoprotein. The successful construction of the vaccine was
confirmed, and the expression of the S protein was verified by western blot and
immunofluorescence staining. In two mouse models (BALB/c or C57BL/6J mice) we studied the
immunogenicity of this candidate vaccine. We show that systemic S-specific IgG antibodies and
nAbs were significantly induced in both models post 3 intramuscular needle injections with 100
µg of VIU-1005 vaccine, and such immunization could induce Th1-skewed and long-lasting

antibody responses and cellular immunity in mice. We further show that the immunogenicity and
induction of Th1-skewed humoral response could be enhanced with the use of needle-free
immunization system in which low doses could be sufficient to elicit significant levels of
systemic S-specific IgG antibodies and nAbs via intramuscular or intradermal immunization. Our
data prove the immunogenicity of our synthetic COVID-19 DNA vaccine and support further
preclinical and clinical testing of this candidate vaccine.

Materials and Methods
In silico design of codon-optimized synthetic consensus S protein
All available SARS-CoV-2 full-length S protein sequences (399 sequences) by March 10th, 2020
were downloaded from GISAID database and dataset was filtered by removing sequences
containing ambiguous amino acid codes (BJOUXZ). The final dataset was multiply aligned
using CLUSTALW and the Shannon entropy for each amino acid position were determined and
the consensus protein sequence was then obtained for the full-length S glycoprotein. The coding
sequence for the consensus protein sequence was then codon-optimized for mammalian
expression and synthesized by GenScript USA Inc (Piscataway, NJ).

DNA constructs
The designed full-length codon-optimized consensus coding sequence for SARS-CoV-2 S
protein was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pVAX1 under the control of the
cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter and denoted as VIU-1005. The coding sequence was
cloned between NheI and KpnI restriction sites using the T4 DNA ligase (Figure 1a). The
construct was confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing. Bulk endotoxin-free
preparations of VIU-1005 and the empty control plasmid (control) were prepared for animal
studies using GenElute™ HP Select Plasmid Gigaprep Kit (Sigma, Germany).

Cells
Baby Hamster kidney BHK-21/WI-2 cell line (Kerafast, EH1011), African Green monkey
kidney-derived Vero E6 cell line (ATCC, CRL-1586) and Human embryonic kidney 293 cells
(ATCC, CRL-1573) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified essential medium (DMEM)

containing penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and supplemented with 5 or 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a 5% CO2 environment at 37°C.

Western blot
Briefly, 70–90% confluent HEK-293 cells in 6-well plates were transiently transfected with 2 μg
of VIU-1005 or control plasmid using JetPRIME® Transient Transfection Protocol and Reagents
(Polyplus, New York, NY) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfected cells were
incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 48 h. Transfected cells were then washed with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA
buffer) (Sigma, Germany). The harvested cell lysates were subjected to western blot analysis to
verify the expression of S protein using in house mouse anti-S (SARS-CoV-2) polyclonal
antibodies at a 1:2000 dilution.

Immunofluorescence analysis
HEK-293 cells (70% confluent) on a 8-well cell culture slide [growth area/well (cm²): 0.98 and
working volume/well (ml): 0.20 - 0.60] were transfected with 0.2 μg of VIU-1005 or control
plasmid using JetPRIME® Transient Transfection Protocol and Reagents (Polyplus, New York,
NY) according to manufacturer’s instructions, and followed incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2
incubator for 24 h. The media was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with
4% formaldehyde at 4°C for 10 min. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and permeabilized
with 0.2% PBS-T (Triton 100) at 4°C for 20 min. Fixed cells were washed twice with PBS-T,
and the nonspecific binding was blocked with 2% goat serum in PBS-T at room temperature for
30 min and washed twice with PBS-T for 5 min. Cells were then incubated with mouse anti-

SARS-CoV-2 S polyclonal antibodies in blocking buffer at 1:2000 dilution at 4°C overnight.
After three washes with PBS-T, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor-488 labeled goat antimouse IgG H&L secondary antibody (Abcam, UK) at 1:500 dilution in blocking buffer in the
dark at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were washed again for three times with PBS-T, and
slides were mounted with VECTASHIELD antifade mounting medium with DAPI counter stain
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Images were captured using Olympus BX51 Fluorescence
Microscope and were analyzed using Image-Pro Plus software.

Animal Studies
Six to 8-week-old female BALB/c or C57BL/6J mice were obtained from and housed in the
animal facility in King Fahd Medical Research Center (KFMRC), King Abdulaziz University
(KAU), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the
guidelines and approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at
KFMRC and the ethical approval from the bioethical committee at KAU (approval number 04CEGMR-Bioeth-2020). In one experiment, two groups of BALB/c or C57BL/6J mice (10 per
group) were intramuscularly immunized via needle injection with 3 doses of 100 µg of either
VIU-1005 or control plasmid at 2-week interval and blood samples were collected for serological
testing every 2 weeks starting from day 0 (pre-bleed) until week 8. In another experiment, three
groups of BALB/c mice (5 per group) were immunized intramuscularly, intradermally or
subcutaneously via needle injection with 3 doses of 100 µg of either VIU-1005 or control
plasmid at 2-week interval and blood samples were collected at different time points until week
25 post primary immunization. In a third experiment, BALB/c mice (4-5 per group) were
intramuscularly or intradermally immunized with 3 doses of 25 µg, 50 µg or 100 µg of VIU-

1005 plasmid at 2-week interval using either conventional needle injection or customized needlefree Tropis system (PharmaJet, Golden, CO) and blood samples were collected every week until
week 8 post primary immunization. Spleens were collected from some animals for flow
cytometry analysis as outlined below.

Indirect ELISA
The end-point titers or optical density (OD) readings at 1:100 dilution of total anti-S1 IgG or its
isotypes (IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b) from immunized mice were determined by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as described previously (Alamri et al., 2017). Briefly, 96-well EU
Immulon 2 HB plates (Thermo Scientific) were coated overnight at 4°C with the SARS-CoV-2
S1 subunit (amino acids 1–685) (Sino Biological, China) at 1 μg/ml in PBS (50 ul/well). Then,
the plates were washed three times with washing buffer (PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST)). This was followed by blocking with 200 μl/well of blocking buffer (5% skim milk in PBST) for 1 h at room temperature. Plates were washed three times and incubated with a 2-fold serial
dilution of mouse sera (100 μl/well) starting from 1:100 dilution in blocking buffer and
incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Some samples collected at different time points were only tested at
1:100 dilution. After three washes, peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG secondary
antibodies as well as anti-IgG1, IgG2a or IgG2b antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch
Laboratories, West Grove, PA) were added at dilutions recommended by the manufacturer and
incubated for 1 h at 37°C as 100 μl/well. Excess secondary antibodies were removed by three
washes and color was developed by adding 3,3’,5,5’- Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate
(KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) for 15 min. Finally, reactions were stopped with 0.16 M sulfuric acid
and absorbance was read spectrophotometrically at 450 nm using the ELx808™ Absorbance

Microplate Reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). End-point titers were determined and expressed as
the reciprocals of the highest dilution with OD reading above the cut-off value defined as the
mean of the control group plus three standard deviations (SD).

SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay
Pseudovirus microneutralization assay was performed as previously described (Almahboub et al.,
2020). Briefly, rVSV-ΔG/SARS-2-S*-luciferase pseudovirus was generated by transfecting
BHK21/WI-2 cells with pcDNA expressing codon-optimized full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein
(GenBank accession number: MN908947) using LipofectamineTM 2000 transfection reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transfected cells were then infected with rVSV-ΔG/G*-luciferase 24
h later, and the supernatant containing the generated rVSV-ΔG/SARS-2-S*-luciferase
pseudovirus was collected 24 h post-infection. The collected virus was titrated by measuring
luciferase activity from serially diluted supernatant on Vero E6 cells and the titer was expressed
as a relative luciferase unit (RLU). Neutralization assay was then conducted by incubating twofold serial dilutions of heat-inactivated mouse sera from vaccinated and control groups starting
from 1:20 dilution (in duplicate) with DMEM-5%FBS containing 5x104 RLU rVSV-ΔG/SARS2-S*-luciferase pseudovirus for 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Pseudovirus–serum
mixtures were transferred onto confluent Vero E6 cell monolayers in white 96-well plates and
incubated for 24 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. After 24 h, cells were lysed, and luciferase
activity was measured using Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, and the luminescence was measured using BioTek Synergy 2
microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). Cell only control (CC) and virus control (VC) were
included with each assay run. The median inhibitory concentration (IC50) of neutralizing

antibodies (nAbs) was determined using four-parameter logistic (4PL) curve in GraphPad Prism
V8 software (GraphPad Co.) and calculated as the reciprocal of the serum dilution at which RLU
was reduced by 50% compared with the virus control wells after subtraction of the background
RLUs in the control groups with cells only.

Flow cytometry
Memory CD8+ and CD4+ T cells interferon (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor–α (TNF-α) and
interleukin-2 (IL-2) IL-2 responses were evaluated at 4 weeks after last immunizations from
immunize animals. Single-cell suspensions of splenocytes were prepared from individual
immunized and control BALB/c mice. In brief, spleens from mice were collected in 3 ml of
RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 5% heat inactivated FBS and
smashed between frosted ends of two glass slides. Processed splenocytes were then filtered
through 70-μm nylon filters and centrifuged at 430 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Red blood
cells were then lysed by adding 3 ml of ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) lysis buffer
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 4 min at room temperature, and equal volume of PBS was then
added for neutralization. Cells were centrifuged again at 430 x g for 5 min at room temperature
and cell pellets were resuspended in RPMI 1640 at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml. One
million cells per well were added to a U-bottom 96-well plate and were stimulated with 5 μg/ml
of pools of overlapping SARS-CoV-2 S protein peptides (GenScript USA Inc, Piscataway, NJ).
The stimulation was performed by incubation for 6 h at 37°C and 5% CO2 in the presence of
Protein Transport Inhibitor Cocktail (brefeldin A) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) at a final
concentration of 1:1000. Splenocytes stimulated in the presence of phorbol 12- myristate 13acetate (PMA), ionomycin, and brefeldin A were used as a positive control, and unstimulated

splenocytes in RPMI 1640 medium were used as a negative control. Cells were then washed in
FACS buffer (PBS with 2% heat inactivated FBS) and stained with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Violet
Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing
with PBS, PB-conjugated anti-mouse CD8, PB-conjugated anti-mouse CD4, APC-conjugated
anti-mouse CD44 antibody and Pe-Cy7-conjugated anti-mouse CD62L antibodies (BioLegend,
UK) were used for surface markers staining. The cells were then washed with FACS buffer and
fixed and permeabilized using Cytofix/Cytoperm Solution (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For intracellular staining, cells were labeled with APCCy7-conjugated anti–mouse IFN-γ (clone XMG1.2), PE-conjugated anti-mouse TNF-α (clone
MP6-XT22) and Pe-Cy7–conjugated anti-mouse IL-2 (clone JES6-5H4) antibodies (BioLegend,
UK) for 20 min at 4°C. Cells were then washed twice with permeabilization buffer and once with
FACS buffer. All data were collected using a 15 laser Aria flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San
Jose, CA) and analyzed using FlowJo v10 software (Tree Star).

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses and graphical presentations were conducted using GraphPad Prism version
8.0 software (Graph-Pad Software, Inc., CA, USA). Statistical analysis was conducted using oneway analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-hoc test to adjust for multiple comparisons
between groups, or Mann–Whitney test. All values are depicted as mean ± SD and statistical
significance is reported as *, P≤0.05, **, P≤0.01, ***, p ≤ 0.001, and ****, p ≤ 0.0001.

Results
In vitro protein expression from the synthetic DNA vaccine
Prior to animal experiments, spike protein expression from the VIU-1005 construct (Figure 1a)
was confirmed in vitro in HEK-293 cells. Western blot analysis confirmed that the recombinant
construct was able to express the spike protein indicated by the band observed at expected
molecular weight, but not in lysates from cells transfected with the control plasmid as shown in
Figure 1b. Immunofluorescence analysis was also performed to visualize the expression and
localization of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein in transfected HEK-293 cells. As shown in Figure
1c, a strong S protein expression in the cytoplasm was only detected in cells transfected with
VIU-1005 using mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 S polyclonal antibodies but not in cells transfected
with the control plasmid.

Intramuscular immunization with VIU-1005 vaccine elicits significant Th1-skewed humoral
immune response in two mouse models
Next, we investigated the immunogenicity induced by the generated synthetic DNA vaccine
candidate (VIU-1005) in BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice (Figures 2a and 3a). The two mouse
models were used to evaluate the type and nature of the immune response as BALB/c and
C57BL/6J mice are phenotypically represent Th2 and Th1 skewed models, respectively. Mice
intramuscularly immunized with three doses of the vaccine induced significant levels of S1specific IgG. Specifically, while we observed that immunization with two doses elicited
significant levels of S1-specific IgG in both BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice (i.e. on week 4),
samples collected 4 weeks post-third immunization (i.e. on week 8) showed higher and more
significant levels compared to control groups immunized with the control plasmid (Figures 2b
and 3b). Interestingly, immunization with VIU-1005 significantly induced higher levels of S1specific IgG2a and IgG2b isotypes compared to IgG1 in both animal models (Figures 2c and
3c). As expected, the bias towards Th1 response was more pronounced in C57BL/6J mice since
they are Th1-prone animals compared to BALB/c mice as shown by the high IgG2a/IgG1 or
IgG2b/IgG1 ratios (Figures 2d and 3d). Nonetheless, BALB/c mice also showed Th1-skewed
response, confirming that VIU-1005 could elicit elevated titers of S1-specific IgG2a and IgG2b
antibodies which is indicative of a skewed Th1 immune response despite the genetic and
phenotypic background of the animal model.

Intramuscular immunization with VIU-1005 vaccine elicits long lasting humoral immune
response in both BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice
To determine if route of immunization can affect immunogenicity of our vaccine candidate and
to measure the longevity of the generated antibody response in mice, we immunized BALB/c
mice with different immunization routes and compared the immunogenicity of VIU-1005 over
extended period of time. Interestingly, intradermal and subcutaneous immunization of BALB/c
mice with three doses of VIU-1005 failed to induce any significant IgG levels (Figures 5c and
5d). On the other hand, such immunization via intramuscular route elicited long-lasting S1specific IgG that lasted until week 25 post-primary immunization (Figure 5a). Taken together,
these data suggest that intramuscular immunization with this synthetic codon-optimized DNA
vaccine could induce long-lasting antibody response in mice.

Needle-free intramuscular immunization enhances the immunogenicity of VIU-1005 vaccine
in mice
To further improve the immunogenicity of the naked synthetic DNA vaccine and minimize the
number and size of doses, we investigated the use of needle-free Tropis system with our vaccine
in BALB/c mice (Figure 6). Immunization with only two or three doses of as low as 25 µg of the
vaccine via intramuscular route was able to elicit significantly high levels of S1-specific total
IgG. Specifically, two or three doses of VIU-1005 were able to induce high levels of S1-specific
total IgG in a dose-dependent fashion (Figure 6b), in which two doses of 50 µg and 100 µg
administered by the needle-free system elicited S1-specific total IgG levels that are equivalent or
higher than that induced by three doses of 100 µg by needle injection shown in Figure 2b. High
levels of endpoint titers of S1-specific total IgG from week 8 sera of mice intramuscularly
immunized with three doses of 25 µg, 50 µg and 100 µg of VIU-1005 were also observed
(Figure 6c). As expected, no S1-specific IgG antibody response was observed from mice
immunized with control plasmid. While we observed a dose-dependent immune response in
immunize animals, no significant differences were observed for S1-specific total IgG among the
sera of mice immunized with VIU-1005 at 25 μg, 50 μg and 100 μg from week 4 onward. We
further investigated the neutralizing activity of the sera from BALB/c mice immunized with the
different doses of VIU-1005 vaccine using needle-free Tropis system. As shown in Figure 6d,
results demonstrated that all three tested doses were able to induce potent titers of nAbs in a
dose-dependent manner against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus in Vero cells. Immunization with
three doses of as low as 25 µg of the vaccine via intramuscular route administered by the needlefree system was sufficient to induce high levels of nAbs, reaching 1x103, which are equivalent to
that induced by three doses of 100 µg by needle injection (Figure 4b). These results suggest that

25 or 50 μg of VIU-1005 is sufficient to induce high titers of S1-specific antibodies and nAbs in
mice using the needle-free system.

Figure 6. Antibody response in BALB/c mice intramuscularly immunized with VIU-1005
using needle-free Tropis system. (a) Timeline of bleeding and immunization regimen. BALB/c
mice were immunized intramuscularly with 3 doses of 25 µg, 50 µg or 100 µg at 2-week interval
using VIU-1005 vaccine or control plasmid. (b) OD values of S1-specific binding total IgG at
1:100 dilution from each mouse were determined by ELISA at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 weeks post first
immunization on day 0. (c) End-point titer of S1-specific total IgG was determined by ELISA in

To further confirm the superiority of the needle-free system compared to the conventional needle
injection, we compared S1-specific total IgG responses in sera collected from BALB/c mice
immunized with 25 µg (Figure 7a), 50 µg (Figure 7b) and 100 µg (Figure 7c) using both
methods of immunization. As shown in Figure 7, needle-free administration of 50 µg and 100
µg not only induced significant high levels of S1-specific total IgG compared to needle injection
but we also observed that all mice immunized with the needle-free system elicited S1-specific

IgG compared to few from the group immunized using needle injection. Furthermore, needlefree immunization with VIU-1005 significantly induced higher levels of S1-specific IgG1, IgG2a
and IgG2b isotypes compared to the conventional needle injection in BALB/c mice, with an
elevated titer of IgG2a and IgG2b antibodies suggesting a bias toward Th1 response at the three
tested doses (Figure 8). Together, these results showed that needle-free immunization not only
enhanced S1-specific IgG levels but also boosted Th1 responses, as demonstrated by markedly
elevated titers of S1-specific IgG2a and IgG2b antibodies.

Needle-free intradermal immunization with VIU-1005 vaccine induces robust S1-specific
humoral response in mice
Interestingly, while intradermal and subcutaneous needle injection using three doses of 100 µg
failed to induce high or significant levels of specific IgG (Figures 5c and 5d), two or three doses
of VIU-1005 administered intradermally via the needle-free system induced significantly high
levels of S1-specific IgG in a dose-dependent fashion (Figure 9b). Importantly, the levels of S1specific IgG were equivalent to those generated by three doses administered by intramuscular
needle injection. When endpoint IgG titers from the week 8 sera of mice immunized with the
three doses of 25 µg, 50 µg and 100 µg were compared, we observed an induction of high levels
of IgG antibody response in mice immunized intradermally with 25 µg of VIU-1005 to levels
similar to those observed in mice immunized with higher doses with no significant differences
(Figure 9c). Importantly, such immunization also elicited high titers of nAbs (Figure 9d). These
data clearly suggest that intradermal needle-free immunization even with low dose could elicit
potent humoral immunity in mice, further confirming the superiority of the needle-free system
compared to the conventional needle injection.

from BALB/c mice immunized with 100 µg of VIU-1005 using needle injection were restimulated ex vivo with four SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools covering SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Flow

Discussion
There is an urgent need to develop a safe and protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 to control
the COVID-19 pandemic. Synthetic DNA vaccines represent a promising vaccine platform to
use in response to outbreaks, such as COVID-19. They could be quickly designed and
synthesized based on viral sequences. Their manufacturing is easy and scalable unlike other
platforms such as viral vector or virus based vaccines (Silveira et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2014).
They are very stable at different storage conditions which can be extremely practical for use in
rural regions (Ingolotti et al., 2010). In addition, the use of consensus S could induce broad
immune response by using conserved sequences which should cover possible variation in viral
sequences. Therefore, here we analyzed all available SARS-CoV-2 S sequences from GISAID
database until March 10th, 2020. Such sequence could offer protection against broad range of
SARS-CoV-2 strains, possibly including emerging strains.

Based on our previous work in developing a vaccine against MERS-CoV as well as other
vaccines developed for other coronaviruses, we selected the SARS-CoV-2 S protein as a target
because it is a major protein on the surface of the virus and a main target for nAbs. In vivo
testing in mice showed intramuscular immunization with three doses of VIU-1005 via needle
injection induced significant and long-lasting levels of Th1-skewed immune response S1-specific
IgG in BALB/c (Th2-dominant mouse strain) and C57BL/6J (Th1-dominant mouse strain) mice
as well as significant levels of nAbs compared to control group with mean IC50 titers of 1x103 in
both models. Importantly, needle-free immunization with doses of as low as 25 µg of the VIU1005 via either intramuscular or intradermal routes was able to elicit high levels of S1-specific
IgG in a dose-dependent fashion in BALB/c mice. Two or three doses of 50 µg and 100 µg

administered by the needle-free system elicited IgG and nAbs levels that are equivalent or higher
than that induced by three doses of 100 µg by needle injection in BALB/c mice. Interestingly,
using needle-free system enhanced the immunogenicity of the VIU-1005 vaccine and induced
significant levels of S1-specific IgG even at 50 µg and 100 µg when given intradermally albeit
the inability of the vaccine to induce any levels of antibodies when administered intradermally
via needle injection. Importantly, our findings show that this vaccine could induce long-lasting
S1-specific antibodies in mice that were detected for at least 25 weeks after primary
immunization.

The use of the needle-free system can not only lead to induction of higher immune response but
also has other advantages including lower vaccine volume and higher antigen expression.
Clinically, needle-free system would be associated with less pain and stress compared to
conventional needle system. As pian at the site of injection was one of the most common adverts
effects of the currently approved SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, needle-free system represents an ideal
alternative to administer vaccines.

Furthermore, this vaccine showed induction of cellular immunity and increase in cytokine
production from both memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cell compartments, including IFN-γ, TNF-α
and IL-2 along with significantly elevated titers of IgG2a and IgG2b, suggesting successful
induction of Th1-skewed immune responses as recently reported (Smith et al., 2020). The fact
that this vaccine induced Th1-biased immune response in both BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice may
alleviate the concerns associated with vaccine-induced immunopathology that has been raised for
SARS and MERS vaccine candidates. Such immunopathology is characterized by Th2-skewed

2005; Deming et al., 2006; Yasui et al., 2008; Bolles et al., 2011; Tseng et al., 2012; Jaume et al.,
2012; Iwata-Yoshikawa et al., 2014; Honda-Okubo et al., 2015; Agrawal et al., 2016; Hashem et
al., 2019).

Taken together, our study confirms the immunogenicity of VIU-1005 vaccine candidate
expressing full-length consensus SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein in eliciting strong Th1-skewed
and long-lasting protective humoral and cellular immunity, and suggest that it could represent a
promising protective candidate vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.
