Abstract:

The SARS CoV-2 pandemic has killed millions of people. This viral infection can
also result in substantial morbidity, including respiratory insufficiency and
neurological manifestations, such as loss of smell and psychiatric diseases. Most
SARS CoV-2 vaccines are based on the spike antigen, and although they have
shown extraordinary efficacy at preventing severe lung disease and death, they
do not always confer sterilizing immune protection. We performed studies in K18hACE2 mice to evaluate whether the efficacy of SARS CoV-2 vaccines could be
augmented by incorporating nucleocapsid as a vaccine antigen. We vaccinated
mice

adenovirus-based

vaccines

alone,

nucleocapsid antigen alone, or combined spike and nucleocapsid antigens. Mice
were then challenged intranasally with SARS CoV-2, and acute viral loads were
quantified at a proximal site of infection (lung) and a distal site of infection
(brain). Interestingly, the spike-based vaccine conferred acute protection in the
lung, but not in the brain. The spike-based vaccine conferred acute protection in
the brain only if combined with the nucleocapsid-based vaccine. These findings
suggest that nucleocapsid-specific immunity is important for the distal control of
SARS CoV-2, warranting the inclusion of nucleocapsid in next-generation COVID19 vaccines.

Introduction

Most SARS CoV-2 vaccines used in humans are based on the spike antigen. These
vaccines have shown high efficacy against severe disease and death, but they do not
always confer sterilizing immunity1-6. In particular, breakthrough infections can be
detected in nasopharyngeal swabs of vaccinated individuals7-9. Nasopharyngeal swabs
typically contain viruses derived from the proximal site of challenge (the respiratory
system), which may not reflect ongoing virus replication at distal sites of the body. It is
unknown whether SARS CoV-2 vaccines can prevent acute viral dissemination to distal
sites of the body, such as the central nervous system, which is considered an immuneprivileged site that is relatively “impermeable” to circulating antibodies10.

The central nervous system has become increasingly important in the management of
COVID-19 disease, especially because even mild or asymptomatic infections can
trigger neurological manifestations, including “brain fog” and psychiatric conditions11.
SARS CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, but prior reports suggest that it may also
disseminate to the brain via the olfactory mucosa12-14. Post-mortem analyses of COVID19 patients have shown the presence of SARS CoV-2 in the brain12,15-17. Knowing
whether vaccines can block viral dissemination to the central nervous system is
important, because this would help elucidate if vaccinated people who get exposed to
the virus could still develop neurological complications. Due to ethical reasons it is not
feasible to sample the brain of vaccinated individuals to assess breakthrough infections
in this distal site.

The SARS CoV-2 spike protein is considered to be a critical antigen target in
coronavirus vaccines. This antigen alone is the basis for the Pfizer/BioNTek vaccine,
Moderna vaccine, Johnson & Johnson’s (J&J) Janssen vaccine, AstraZeneca vaccine,
CanSino vaccine, Sputnik V vaccine, Novavax vaccine, among others. Vaccines that
encode the viral spike generate robust neutralizing antibodies that prevent the initial
entry of SARS CoV-2 into the respiratory system, but it is still unclear whether other viral
antigens provide equally important immune protection. It is also unclear whether
inclusion of multiple viral antigens could provide a synergistic improvement in vaccineelicited protection. In this study, we compared the efficacy of spike-based versus
nucleocapsid-based vaccines after an intranasal SARS CoV-2 challenge in K18-hACE2
mice, which are highly susceptible to SARS CoV-2 infection. Surprisingly, we show that
a spike-based vaccine does not provide acute protection to the central nervous system;
protection against distal viral dissemination to the nervous system was only observed
when a spike-based vaccine was co-administered with a nucleocapsid-based vaccine.
These findings demonstrate a potent synergy between spike-specific and nucleocapsidspecific immune responses, and provide a framework for the rational design of
coronavirus vaccines.

Results

Immunogenicity of spike-based and nucleocapsid-based SARS CoV-2 vaccines.

K18-hACE2 mice constitute a robust pre-clinical model that recapitulates salient
features of SARS CoV-2 infection in humans, including respiratory insufficiency, a
dysregulated inflammatory response, neurological complications and death. Therefore,
this mouse model has been useful for investigating antiviral therapies, vaccines, and for
understanding COVID-19 pathogenesis18-22. We first vaccinated K18-hACE2 mice
intramuscularly with an adenovirus vector expressing: SARS CoV-2 spike (Ad5-S),
nucleocapsid (Ad5-N), or both (Ad5-S+N), at a dose of 109 PFU per mouse.

After three weeks, mice were bled. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were
used for tetramer binding assays (KbVL8 to detect spike-specific CD8 T cells) or
intracellular cytokine staining assays (ICS) to detect nucleocapsid-specific CD8 T cells;
and sera were used for antibody quantification by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) (Figure 1A). Ad5-S and Ad5-N vaccination elicited detectable CD8 T cell and
antibody responses (Figure 1B-1E). These results confirm the immunogenicity of the
spike-based and nucleocapsid-based vaccines.

A spike-based vaccine provides proximal protection in the lung, but not distal
protection in the brain.

We performed intranasal challenges with 5x104 PFU of SARS CoV-2 (isolate USAWA1/2020), followed by euthanasia 72 hr post-challenge to evaluate acute viral loads in
tissues. We also challenged unvaccinated K18-hACE2 mice as controls.

First, we

compared viral loads in the lung, which represents a proximal site of challenge.
Intranasal challenge of unvaccinated K18-hACE2 mice with SARS CoV-2 normally
results in high viral replication in lung, followed by distal dissemination to the brain by
day 2 post-challenge18. Consistent with prior studies18-21, the unvaccinated mice showed
high viral loads in lung (Figure 2A). Mice vaccinated with the nucleocapsid-based
vaccine showed a pattern of improved antiviral control in lung, but this was not
statistically significant. In contrast, mice vaccinated with the spike-based vaccine
exhibited significant antiviral protection in the lung (Figure 2A).

Importantly, vaccination of mice with both spike-based and nucleocapsid-based
vaccines did not confer any synergistic protective advantage in the lung, relative to
spike-based vaccine alone (Figure 2A). These data show that a spike-based vaccine
alone is sufficient to protect the site of initial viral entry, the respiratory system.

Effect of nucleocapsid-specific immunity in the distal control of a SARS CoV-2
infection.

At first glance, the data above suggested that nucleocapsid-specific immunity plays a
dispensable role during a SARS CoV-2 infection. Nucleocapsid-specific immunity has
recently garnered attention as a main target for T cell responses23-25. Antibody

responses block the initial entry of viruses at proximal sites of challenge, but once the
infection has occurred, T cell responses are critical for controlling second-round
infections and subsequent viral dissemination to distal sites. SARS CoV-2 is thought to
disseminate to the nervous system after second-round infections that progress from the
olfactory mucosa to the brain14. Although current SARS CoV-2 vaccines show high
efficacy in protecting the respiratory system via their induction of neutralizing antibodies,
it is not clear whether they can provide acute protection at distal sites.

We show that mice immunized with a spike-based vaccine (or a nucleocapsid-based
vaccine) exhibit a pattern or reduced viral loads in brain relative to unimmunized mice,
but this was not statistically significant (Figure 2B). However, combining a spike-based
vaccine with a nucleocapsid-based vaccine resulted in significantly improved protection
in brain (Figure 2B). Taken together, these findings show that spike-specific immunity
confers acute protection in the site of initial viral entry (the respiratory system), but acute
protection in distal sites may critically depend on also having nucleocapsid-specific
immunity.

Discussion:

Several SARS CoV-2 vaccines have received emergency use authorization (EUA),
including the Pfizer/BioNTek vaccine, Moderna vaccine, Johnson & Johnson’s (J&J)
Janssen vaccine, AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, CanSino vaccine, Sputnik V vaccine,
and Novavax vaccine. All of these vaccines are based solely on the spike protein of
SARS CoV-2, and have demonstrated high efficacy against severe COVID-19. Although
these vaccines prevent severe disease and death, breakthrough infections can occur in
vaccinated individuals, suggesting that vaccine efficacy can be further improved.

Insidious neurological manifestations are common after SARS CoV-2 infection, and it is
unknown if vaccines can block acute SARS CoV-2 replication in the nervous system. An
unanticipated result from our studies is that a spike-based vaccine does not protect the
central nervous system early following infection. This observation could help explain
symptomatic infections that are reported in a fraction of vaccinated individuals, which
can be associated with loss of smell and other neurological manifestations.

The establishment of initial infection foci in the respiratory system is inhibited by spikespecific antibodies, which are secreted at the mucosa and can block binding of the virus
to the ACE2 receptor. On the other hand, secondary infection foci in distal tissues may
be more susceptible to cytotoxic T cells, due to their ability to transmigrate into tissues
and kill virally-infected cells. The nucleocapsid protein of SARS CoV-2 has been
suggested to be an important target for T cell responses23-25. Firstly, this protein

contains conserved cross-reactive T cell epitopes that are present among different
coronaviruses, suggesting that it could be a target for universal coronavirus vaccines26.
Secondly, the nucleocapsid protein is among the most abundant structural proteins in
the coronavirus lifecycle27-29, which may facilitate antigen presentation and recognition
by T cells.

A limitation of our study is that we only measured viral loads at a very early timepoint
(72 hr post-challenge). We did not compare viral loads at other time points, because
unvaccinated animals succumb by day 6 post-challenge19, and because it is known that
spike-based vaccination elicits immune responses that ultimately clear SARS CoV-2
within a week of challenge30,31. Our study was focused on evaluating acute viral control
at a very early time post-challenge. Future studies will determine whether these findings
generalize to other vaccine platforms besides adenovirus-based vectors (e.g. mRNA
vaccines encoding nucleocapsid), and whether other virus-specific immune responses
(e.g. envelope-, membrane-specific) can improve further distal protection. Although the
K18-hACE2 model is considered useful to evaluate vaccines and antivirals, the
extensive acute viral dissemination observed in brain may be a peculiarity of this mouse
model. Nevertheless, it is still reasonable to conclude that nucleocapsid-specific
immunity improves distal viral control of SARS CoV-2. In conclusion, we show a
substantial benefit of including both spike and nucleocapsid antigens in COVID-19
vaccines. These results warrant the incorporation of nucleocapsid as a critical antigen in
future coronavirus vaccines.

Materials and Methods

Mice and vaccinations:
6-8-week-old K18-hACE2 mice were used. These mice express the human ACE2
protein behind the keratin 18 promoter, directing expression in epithelial cells. Mice
were purchased from Jackson laboratories (Stock No: 034860). Approximately half were
males and half were females. Mice were immunized intramuscularly (50

μL

per

quadriceps) with an Ad5 vector expressing SARS CoV-2 spike protein (Ad5-S), or
nucleocapsid protein (Ad5-N), or both; diluted in sterile PBS, at 109 PFU per mouse.
Ad5-N was a kind gift of the Masopust/Vezys laboratory32. These are non-replicating
Ad5 vectors (E1/E3 deleted). The vectors contain a CMV (Cytomegalovirus) promoter
driving the expression of the respective proteins. The Ad5 vectors were propagated on
trans-complementing HEK293 cells (ATCC), purified by cesium chloride density
gradient centrifugation, titrated, and then frozen at −80°C.

SARS CoV-2 virus and infections:
The following reagent was deposited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
and obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: SARS-Related Coronavirus 2, Isolate
USA-WA1/2020, NR-52281. Virus was propagated and tittered on Vero-E6 cells. K18hACE2 mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and challenged with 5x104 PFU of virus.
Mouse infectious were performed at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) following
BL3 guidelines with approval by the UIC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC).

SARS CoV-2 quantification in tissues:
Tissues were isolated from infected mice and homogenized in sterile PBS. RNA was
isolated with the Zymo 96-well RNA isolation kit (Catalog #: R1052) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. SARS CoV-2 viral burden was measured by qRT-PCR using
Taqman primer and probe sets from IDT with the following sequences: Forward 5’ GAC
CCC AAA ATC AGC GAA AT 3’, Reverse 5’ TCT GGT TAC TGC CAG TTG AAT CTG
3’, Probe 5’ ACC CCG CAT TAC GTT TGG TGG ACC 3’. A SARS CoV-2 copy number
control was obtained from BEI (NR-52358) and used to quantify SARS-CoV-2 genomes.

Reagents, flow cytometry and equipment:
Single cell suspensions were obtained from PBMCs. Dead cells were gated out using
Live/Dead fixable dead cell stain (Invitrogen). SARS CoV-2 nucleocapsid peptide pools
were obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH (Peptide Array, SARS-Related
Coronavirus 2 Nucleocapsid (N) Protein, NR-52404). These peptide pools were used for
intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) to detect nucleocapsid-specific CD8 T cells. The
peptide stimulation was performed in the presence of GolgiPlug and GolgiStop (BD
Biosciences) for 5 hr at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. MHC class I monomers (KbVL8,
VNFNFNGL) were used for detecting spike-specific CD8 T cells, and were obtained
from the NIH tetramer facility located at Emory University. MHC monomers were
tetramerized in-house. The VNFNFNGL epitope is located in position 539-546 of the
SARS CoV-2 spike protein, or position 525-532 of the SARS CoV-1 spike protein. Cells
were stained with fluorescently-labeled antibodies against CD8α (53-6.7 on PerCP-

Cy5.5), CD44 (IM7 on Pacific Blue), KbVL8 or IFNγ (XMG1.2) on APC. Fluorescentlylabeled antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen, except for anti-CD44 (which
was from Biolegend). Flow cytometry samples were acquired with a Becton Dickinson
Canto II or an LSRII and analyzed using FlowJo (Treestar).

SARS CoV-2-specific ELISA:
Binding antibody titers were quantified using ELISA as described previously

, using

spike protein as a coating antigen. In brief, 96-well flat bottom plates MaxiSorp (Thermo
Scientific) were coated with 0.1μg/well of SARS CoV-2 RBD protein, for 48 hr at 4ºC.
Plates were washed with PBS + 0.05% Tween-20. Blocking was performed for 4 hr at
room temperature with 200 μL of PBS + 0.05% Tween-20 + bovine serum albumin. 6μL
of sera were added to 144

μL of

blocking solution in first column of plate, 1:3 serial

dilutions were performed until row 12 for each sample and plates were incubated for 60
minutes at room temperature. Plates were washed three times followed by addition of
goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Southern Biotech) diluted in
blocking solution (1:5000), at 100

μL/well

and incubated for 60 minutes at room

temperature. Plates were washed three times and 100 μL /well of Sure Blue substrate
(Sera Care) was added for approximately 8 minutes. Reaction was stopped using 100

μL/well of KPL TMB stop solution (Sera Care). Absorbance was measured at 450 nm
using a Spectramax Plus 384 (Molecular Devices). SARS CoV-2 RBD protein was
made at the Northwestern Recombinant Protein Production Core by Dr. Sergii
