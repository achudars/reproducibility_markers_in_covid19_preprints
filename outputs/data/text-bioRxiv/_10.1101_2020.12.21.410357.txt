Abstract:
Viruses, being obligate intracellular parasites, must first attach themselves and gain entry into
host cells. Viral fusion machinery is the central player in the viral attachment process in almost
every viral disease. Viruses have incorporated an array of efficient fusion proteins on their
surfaces to bind efficiently to host cell receptors. They make use of the host proteolytic
enzymes to rearrange their surface protein(s) into the form which facilitates their binding to
host- cell membrane proteins and subsequently, fusion. This stage of viral entry is very critical
and has many therapeutic implications. The current global pandemic of COVID-19 has sparked
severe health crisis and economic shutdowns. SARS-CoV2, the etiological agent of the disease
has led to millions of deaths and brought the scientific community together in an attempt to
understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis and mortality. Like other viral fusion
machinery, CoV2 spike (S) glycoprotein- ‘The Demogorgon’ poses the same questions about
viral-host cell fusion. The intermediate stages of S protein-mediated viral fusion are unclear
owing to the lack of structural insights and concrete biochemical evidence. The mechanism of
conformational transition is still unclear. S protein binding and fusion with host cell receptors,
Eg., angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is accompanied by cleavage of S1/S2 subunits.
To track the key events of viral-host cell fusion, we have identified (in silico) that low pHinduced conformational change and ACE-2 binding events promote S1 dissociation.
Deciphering key mechanistic insights of SARS-CoV2 fusion will further our understanding of
other class- I fusion proteins

Background:
Viruses constitute a vast majority of space under the infectious disease category. In the history
of pandemics, viruses along with bacteria have conferred a major threat to world health as well
as the economy. Unlike bacteria, they have higher mutation rates which make them easy to
evolve into a better construct. HIV-I genome showed the highest mutation rate of (4.1 ± 1.7) ×
10−3 per base per cell [1]. The infectivity and lethality can vary from benign to acute. Although
there are specific characteristics of each virus that set each of them apart are being crudely
focused, there is some common key machinery that helps them evade the host cellular
environment. One of such machinery is viral-host membrane fusion mediated by viral
glycoproteins and host proteolytic cleavage. Viral glycoproteins also known as fusion proteins,
are extremely capable of transitioning into different structurally distinct prefusion/post-fusion
states [2-4]. Based on these common features of transitions, fusion proteins are classified into
three classes. Despite the knowledge about two states, the intermediate events for any viral
fusion are poorly understood [5]. The novel construct of Coronavirus genome- SARS- CoV2
poses the same inadequacy of knowledge about fusion machinery. Like other fusion proteins,
it undergoes spontaneous transition driven by factors like i) low pH [6], ii) Host Receptor
Binding [7], iii) Host-mediated proteolytic cleavage [8] and iv) host membrane composition
(In case of Ebola) [9]. Although there are many biochemical analyses [10-14] for the
intermediates, many structural insights still remain unclear. Spike glycoprotein of SARSCoV2 is the class I fusion protein with trimeric assembly [15]. Deciphering the intermediate
stages of the pre-fusion to post-fusion conformational transition can change the whole
knowledge about viral fusion proteins. This could lead us to develop effective therapeutics
which can block the transition as well as the successful fusion.

Introduction:
The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV2 is the large trimeric structure crucial for viral-cell
fusion with the molecular weight of about 424 kDa. The structure has the three major
topological domains which include Head, Stalk and Cytoplasmic Tail (CT). Each monomeric
unit of the protein has two subunits namely S1 and S2 [16]. S1 has the regions responsible for
host receptor binding- N-terminal Domain (NTD) and Receptor Binding domain (RBD). Most
of the S2 regions serve as the fusion machinery- Fusion Peptide (FP), Central Helix (CH),
Heptad Repeat (HR), etc (Figure 1.1, Figure 1.2.A). Although these regions are mostly
conserved (compared to older strains of Coronaviridae family), few mutations are seen in the
Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and it is also noteworthy that this new construct has
polybasic cleavage site [18] which is not present in the previously encountered viral strains.
This new region increases the rate of S1/S2 cleavage and thereby, elevates efficiency of viral
entry into the host cells. Only for the Head domain, the experimental structure is available and
the rest of the topological domains have been successfully modelled in accordance with many
experimental data [19]. The stalk domain is responsible for global protein flexibility and allows
the glycoprotein to bend in different angles [20]. It is the best example of a mechanistic protein
i.e., it has exhibited many states which are shown in the Figure1.2 B.
Followed by Angiotensin Collecting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2) Receptor binding in open form/ RBD
‘Up’ form (active form), the fusion events are initiated. The cleavage is likely to be mediated
by host furin or TRPMSS2 at two distinct sites- S1/S2 and S2/S2’ respectively [21]. As stated
earlier, the polybasic cleavage site at the S1/S2 interface brings about effective proteolytic
cleavage, thereby promoting the mechanistic tendency of the spike glycoprotein to mature into
the post-fusion state. The steps of such transitions are unclear because very few biochemical
evidence has been found for the intermediates.

But it is well known that S1/S2 cleavage (Figure 1.3. A) promotes S1 dissociation whereas
S2/S2’ (Figure 1.3. B) cleavage paves the way for S2 maturation (into the postfusion state)
because Fusion peptide carrying the membrane fusing segment- ‘FPPR’ is released along with
Heptad Repeat (HR) which holds the FP straight towards the host membrane. Although the
cleaved states for the Stabilized CoV1 did not show any immediate conformational changes in
the Cryo-EM experiments [22], our analysis on CoV2 Spike showed that the post cleavage
state is much more disordered. Right after the binding event with ACE-2, the structural changes
like decreased S1/S2 contact start to occur [23]. Our preliminary analysis confirmed this
conformational change and yielded deeper insights.
The key role of glycans in protein shielding has come to the fore recently. Due to the recent
reports, several glycan associated analyses have become prominent and repositories (such as
protein data bank) have focused on easier retrieval of glycans which are associated with
proteins. A recent study on SARS-CoV2 spike by Casalino et al., 2020 has shed more light on
the role of glycans beyond just protein shielding. In that study, the group identified that the
glycans in N165 and N234 stabilize the RBD ‘Up’ state [24]. And another study depicted its
importance in maintaining contact with the ACE-2 Receptor [25]. Recently, the same glycans
involved in RBD ‘Up’ state are known to form a cryptic pocket during the intermediate’s
opening pathway [26].

Results and Discussion:
i) Low pH creates unfavourable charge distribution in S1/S2 Interface and thereby promotes
S1 Dissociation:
S1 dissociation is a spontaneous step which occurs after S1/S2 Cleavage and the ACE-2
Binding event. S1 and S2 have two putative contact interfaces C1 and C2 (Supplementary
Figure 2.1). Of the two, Amaro Lab ‘Closed’ state model (depicting postcleaved S1/S2 state)
showed that C2 has a complex hydrogen-bonding network (Supplementary Figure 2.1). Also,
a strong electrostatic complementarity was seen in the C1 and C2 (Supplementary Figure 2.2).
But in the dynamical events, the external physical conditions were found to play a vital role in
the conformational arrangement of proteins. Hence, we hypothesised that the low pH would
create an unfavourable charge distribution. The hypothesis is successfully proven by the
preliminary results from ProPka. The pKa values for the titratable residues are calculated as
follows:
𝒑𝑲𝒂 = 𝒑𝑲𝒎𝒐𝒅𝒆𝒍 + 𝒑𝑲𝑯𝑩 + 𝒑𝑲𝑫𝑺 + 𝒑𝑲𝑪𝑪
where 𝒑𝑲𝒎𝒐𝒅𝒆𝒍 is the reference pKa value for each titratable amino acid and 𝒑𝑲𝑯𝑩 , 𝒑𝑲𝑫𝑺 ,
𝒑𝑲𝑪𝑪 are the pKa values decreased in the event of hydrogen bonding interaction, desolvation
and coulombic contact, respectively.
On analysing the titratable residues in the S1/S2 Interface (Figure 1.4.A) of ‘Closed’ and ‘ACE2 Bound’ experimental structures (PDB ID: 6VXX and 6A98 respectively), it becomes clear
that the interface residues of the ‘ACE-2 Bound’ state exhibited higher pKa values than the
interface residues of the ‘Closed’ state (Figure 1.4.B). This implies that the hydrogen bonding
network and Coulombic contacts begin to diminish at the low pH receptor binding event, which
would result in increased 𝒑𝑲𝑯𝑩 , 𝒑𝑲𝑪𝑪 values. Also, charge calculations across the pH

spectrum proved that low pH induces unfavourable positive/neutral charge distribution in the
S1/S2 interface (Figure 1.5).
We obtained a different result from Amaro lab model of ‘Open’ state (Supplementary figure
2.4.A). Unlike in ‘ACE-2 Bound’ state, the pKa values of the interface residues are decreased,
providing us with the insights on the differences between ‘Open’ and ‘ACE-2 Bound’ states.
The charge distribution again showed increasing values across decreasing pH (Supplementary
figure 2.4.B).
ii) S1/S2 Cleavage Elevates Local Disorderliness in S1/S2 Interface Environment:
We compared the uncleaved (precleaved) (CHARMM Model) and postcleaved (Amaro Lab
Model) S1/S2 models (Figure 1.6) with Normal Mode Analysis incorporated with Anisotropic
Network Model (ANM). NMA is the approximation technique of Molecular Dynamic
Simulation that uses a network model and calculates projection of each atom assuming a
harmonic oscillation. Calculating Hessian Matrix for each atomic projection can provide us
with insights about fluctuations and other dynamical properties. Applying NMA-ANM for the
postcleaved as well as precleaved states, we came to find that postcleaved S1/S2 state showed
increased RMSF (especially in S1/S2 interface) than that of precleaved S1/S2 state (Figure
1.7). It provided the preliminary insight that host-mediated proteolytic cleavage elevates
relative disorderliness in S1/S2 interface and further promotes S1 dissociation. It is noteworthy
that neither experimental structures nor models are capable of illustrating S2/S2’ cleavage,
which can be studied only through rigorous MD approaches.
iii) Experimental Evidence Proves Host-Receptor Induced Conformational Changes:
We also generated distant maps for the experimental structures in ‘Closed’ and ‘ACE-2 Bound’
states (Figure 1.8). It became clear that the contact distance in S1/S2 interface of the ‘ACE-2
Bound’ state appeared to have diminished. We could observe that the NTD and CTD-2 regions

are fluctuating in nature whereas HR of S2 remained stable (Figure 1.9). This confirms that
Host-Receptor binding also influences S1 dissociation.

Materials and Methods:
i) pH and Charge Calculations:
To observe pH-induced changes, we used PropKa 3.0 [27]. The pKa calculation was done for
all the titratable residues of the different states of S protein (Chain A). Initially, we performed
the calculations for the experimental S protein structures in Closed and Three RBD bound
states (PDB ID: 6VXX and 6A98 respectively). To also assess the nature of S1/S2 interface of
the full-length model of open and closed states, we used Amaro Lab model which is available
as open-source. The pKa values of the titratable interface residues were then taken for further
consideration, as our interest fits into the S1/S2 interface where possible initial events of S1
dissociation occur. Then the charge of the titratable residues upon decreasing pH i.e., 7 to 3
was calculated for the experimental and modelled structures to find the effect of pH in order to
prove our hypothesis about unfavourable charge distribution. The charge values were obtained
with the pH plot profiling module available at VMD 1.9.3. The titratable residues of S1/S2
interface were subjected for the charge profiling with the decreasing pH in the units of 0.01.
The data points were then retrieved for comprehensive plotting with GNUPLOT 5.2.
ii) Comparing Precleaved/Postcleaved States with ANM-NMA:
For better understanding the roles of S1/S2 cleavage, we need to compare the S1/S2 interface
environment in both the states. We chose the models which clearly depict the precleaved
(CHARMM-Model)/postcleaved (Amaro Lab Model) states. For both structures, backbone
Anisotropic Network Model-Normal Mode Analysis (ANM-NMA) was performed for 3 modes
due to the reason that 3 modes NMA calculation is optimum for observing global fluctuations.
The square fluctuations for both states were then calculated and resulting differential

fluctuation values were compared. All these steps were performed with the Python-based toolProDy 1.10.11 [28].
iii) Distance Map Generation for the Receptor Bound/Unbound States:
For deriving a conclusive proof for the receptor-induced conformational changes in the S1/S2
interface, we built S1/S2 distance maps for the experimental structures in closed as well as in
Receptor bound states (PDB ID: 6VXX and 6A98 respectively). Also, generating the distance
map may help us understand how receptor binding influences the S1 dissociation. With the
Protein Contact Map generator [29], inter-residue distances were calculated and then the final
correlation map was generated.

Conclusion:
Viral glycoproteins are the enhanced fusion machinery exhibiting the diverse dynamical and
structural nature of biomacromolecules. This makes them pivotal to delineate their function.
The key events during viral-host cell fusion are still enigmatic and there are several unsolved
questions. One such event is the dissociation of protein subunits S1 and S2 in SARS-CoV2 S
protein. Understanding this spontaneous but substantial event with the aid of unconventional
MD approaches which when validated by using molecular biological techniques would give us
a crystal-clear perspective of how class- I fusion proteins function. Our preliminary results on
key conformational changes provide an insight towards the importance of further extending
our knowledge about fusion proteins and their dissociation events. Delineating fusion proteins
like this can impact Structural Virology as well as promiscuous drug development.
