ABSTRACT
The number of new cases world-wide for the COVID-19 disease is increasing dramatically, while
efforts to contain Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 is producing varied results in
different countries. There are three key SARS-CoV-2 enzymes potentially targetable with antivirals:
papain-like protease (PLpro), main protease (Mpro), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Of these,
PLpro is an especially attractive target because it plays an essential role in several viral replication
processes, including cleavage and maturation of viral polyproteins, assembly of the replicasetranscriptase complex (RTC), and disruption of host viral response machinery to facilitate viral
proliferation and replication. Moreover, this enzyme is conserved across different coronaviruses and
promising inhibitors have already been discovered for its SARS-CoV variant. Here we report a
substantive body of structural, biochemical, and virus replication studies that identify several
inhibitors of the enzyme from SARS-CoV-2 in both wild-type and mutant forms. These efforts
include the first structures of wild-type PLpro, the active site C111S mutant, and their complexes
with inhibitors, determined at 1.60–2.70 Angstroms. This collection of structures provides
fundamental molecular and mechanistic insight to PLpro, and critically, illustrates details for
inhibitors recognition and interactions. All presented compounds inhibit the peptidase activity of
PLpro in vitro, and some molecules block SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture assays. These
collated findings will accelerate further structure-based drug design efforts targeting PLpro, with the
ultimate goal of identifying high-affinity inhibitors of clinical value for SARS-CoV-2.

INTRODUCTION

The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing the COVID19 pandemic. The virus belongs to the clade B of genus Betacoronavirus

1

and has large (+) sense

ssRNA genome coding for 29 proteins. The 4 structural and 9-10 accessory proteins are translated
from subgenomic RNAs produced from (–) sense ssRNA 2. To reach the replication stage, the CoV2 genomic (+) sense ssRNA is used as mRNA to ultimately produce 15 non-structural proteins (Nsps)
from two large polyproteins, Pp1a (4,405 amino acids) and Pp1ab (7,096 amino acids) 3. Pp1a is
cleaved into the first 10 Nsps (Nsp11 is just a 7 residue peptide) and Pp1ab, which is made through
a –1 ribosomal frame-shifting mechanism 4. The resulting Pp1ab contains all 15 Nsps 5. Therefore,
proper polyprotein processing is essential for the release and maturation of the 15 Nsps and assembly
into cytoplasmic, ER membrane-bound multicomponent replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC),
which is responsible for directing the replication, transcription and maturation of the viral genome
and subgenomic mRNAs

6,7

.

There are two distinctive cysteine proteases encoded by the CoV-2 genome that are essential to
the virus proliferation cycle 6: papain-like protease (PLpro, a domain within Nsp3, EC 3.4.22.46)
and chymotrypsin-like main protease (3CLpro or Mpro, corresponding to Nsp5, EC 3.4.22.69). The
main protease cuts 11 sites in Pp1a/Pp1ab with sequence consensus X-(L/F/M)-Q↓(G/A/S)-X 7,8 and
PLpro cleaves 3 sites, with recognition sequence consensus “LXGG¯XX”, but is as indispensable as
Mpro because its activity extends far beyond polyproteins cleavage.
PLpro is a domain of Nsp3 – a large multidomain protein that is an essential component of the
RTC 7,8. The enzyme is located in Nsp3 between the SARS unique domain (SUD/HVR) and a nucleic
acid-binding domain (NAB). It is highly conserved and found in all coronaviruses 8, often in two
copies, denoted as PL1pro and PL2pro

9,10

. In CoV-2, Nsp3 contains 1,945 residues (~212 kDa) 3.

This cysteine protease cleaves peptide bonds between Nsp1 and Nsp2 (LNGG¯AYTR), Nsp2 and
Nsp3 (LKGG¯APTK), and Nsp3 and Nsp4 (LKGG¯KIVN) liberating three proteins: Nsp1, Nsp2
and Nsp3 10. The LXGG motif found in Pp1a/Pp1ab corresponds to the P4–P1 substrate positions of
cysteine proteases and is essential for recognition and cleavage by PLpro 10,11. Nsp1 is a 180 residue
protein

(https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.07.191676). Nsp2 is a 638 residue protein that was proposed to
modulate host cell survival 12.
PLpro exhibits multiple proteolytic and other functions 13. In addition to processing Pp1a/Pp1ab,
it was shown in SARS- and MERS-CoVs to have deubiquitinating activity, efficiently disassembling
mono-, di-, and branched-polyubiquitin chains. It also has deISG15ylating (interferon-induced gene
15) activities. Both ubiquitin and ISG15 protein carry the PLpro recognition motif at their C-termini
14,15

suggesting that removal of these modifications from host cells interferes with the host response

to viral infection

10,16-19

. PLpro also inactivates TBK1, blocks NF-kappaB signaling, prevents

translocation of IRF3 to the nucleus, inhibits the TLR7 signaling pathway, and induces Egr-1dependent up-regulation of TGF-β1

18,20

. Further illustrating the complex and diverse functions of

the protein, in some reports, various PLpro roles are decoupled from its proteolytic activity

21,22

.

Nevertheless, PLpro is a multifunctional protein having an essential role in processing of viral
polyproteins, maturation, and assembly of the RTC, and it also may act on the host cell proteins by
disrupting host viral response machinery to facilitate viral proliferation and replication. Due to the
centrality of PLpro to viral replication, it is therefore an excellent candidate for therapeutic targeting.
Ongoing efforts to identify antivirals for CoV-2 to date have focused mainly on three Nsp proteins
identified as the key drug targets from previous SARS- and MERS-CoV studies: Nsp3 PLpro, Nsp5
Mpro, and Nsp12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Here we discuss the case for targeting SARSCoV-2 Nsp3, PLpro. The enzyme is conserved in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Swine Acute Diarrhea
Syndrome (SADS) coronaviruses (Supplemental Fig. 1), and other viruses including Murine Hepatitis
Virus, Avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus, and Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV);
fortuitously, it has low sequence similarity to human enzymes. The sequence, structure, and
functional conservation of PLpro suggests that therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2 PLpro may also
be effective against related viruses with PLpro. In the past, this enzyme was structurally well
characterized and currently there are over 40 structures of viral PLpro proteases in the Protein Data
Bank 23, mainly from SARS-CoV, that can aid structure-based drug discovery. In fact, the past 15
years of studies with PLpro have led to the identification of a number of inhibitors that were specific
for SARS-CoV PLpro, but did not inhibit the MERS-CoV enzyme 7,24,25. Unfortunately, these efforts
have failed, thus far, to produce antivirals that can be useful for treatment of SARS-CoV-1 and -2
infections in humans.

Here we report eight crystal structures, including the first structure of wild-type PLpro, the active
site cysteine mutant, and their complexes with known and novel inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro,
determined at 1.60–2.70 Angstroms. These data reveal the structural basis of the enzyme with fine
molecular details, and illustrate specific ligand recognition and interactions. The presented
compounds inhibit PLpro peptidase activity in vitro, and most importantly, several of the novel
inhibitors also block SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture. Collectively, these findings provide
critical insights for further structure-based drug design efforts against PLpro to enable the design of
even higher affinity inhibitors and, ultimately, human therapeutics.

Results and Discussion
The CoV-2 PLpro sequence is 83% identical and 90% similar to SARS-CoV-1 and 31% identical
and 49% similar to MERS-CoV and even more distant to SADS PLpro (Supplemental Fig. 1).
Between SARS- and MERS-CoV many substitutions are quite conservative, but there are some that
may have significant impact on protein stability, dynamics, ligand binding, and catalytic properties.
Examples include Thr75 (Leu/Val), Pro129 (Ala/Ile), Tyr172 (His/Thr), Lys200 (Thr/Gln), Lys274
(Thr/Val) and Cys284 (Arg/Arg), with equivalent residues shown in parentheses for SARS/MERS
PLpro, respectively.
CoV-2 PLpro is a slightly basic, 315 residue protein with high content of cysteine residues (3.5%).
In addition to catalytic Cys111, there are four cysteine residues coordinating important structural zinc
ion and other six distributed throughout the protein structure. Similar to Mpro (submitted) 26, the
active site cysteine seems much more reactive as evident by structures of covalent adducts reported
in the PDB (PDB id: 6WX4 and 6WUU). CoV-2 Mpro-active cysteine has been shown to have
different level of oxidation in crystals (PDB id: 6XKF, 6XKH and publication submitted). The
potential sensitivity of PLpro Cys111 to oxidation presented a challenge for structure determination
as the wild-type protein exhibited rather poor crystallization properties. The PLpro active site contains
a canonical cysteine protease catalytic triad (Cys111, His272 and Asp286)
catalytic dyad (Cys145 and His41)

26

17

, while Mpro has

, which may account for somewhat dissimilar chemical

properties of the two enzymes. PLpro may have catalytic properties more common with other cysteine
proteases with the generally accepted thiolate form of Cys111 acting as nucleophile, His272 serving
as a general acid-base, and Asp286 promoting deprotonation of Cys111.

Structure determination and structural comparisons
We have determined eight structures of PLpro from CoV-2, including two wild-type apo-protein
structures, one at 2.70 Å (PDB id: 6W9C) and the other in different crystal packing at 1.79 Å (PDB
id: 6WZU), both at 100 K, the apo-PLpro active site C111S mutant under cryogenic conditions 100
K at 1.60 Å (PDB id: 6WRH) and at 293 K at 2.50 Å (PDB id: 6XG3). The first structure (WILDTYPE) was solved by molecular replacement using SARS PLpro model as a template. The
subsequent structures were phased with the refined wild-type model. Structures were refined as
described in Supplementary Materials and Methods and data and refinement statistics is shown in
Supplementary Table 1. For high resolution structures, all residues are visible in the electron density
maps, for 2.70 Å structure of wild-type enzyme three N-terminal residues are missing and for the 293
K 2.50 Å mutant structure two N-terminal and one C-terminal residues are missing. Of significance,
the electron density map for residues around the active site is excellent. These structures are virtually
identical with the largest difference being between the lowest (2.70 Å) and highest resolution (1.60
Å) structures (RMSD 0.72 Å). They differ the most in the zinc-binding region and in the Gly266 –
Gly271 loop containing Tyr268 and Gln269. The high resolution wild-type and C111S mutant
structures show RMSD 0.10 Å, and 293 K and 100 K mutant structures show RMSD 0.27 Å. In the
high resolution structures, in addition to structural zinc ion, there are two chloride and two phosphate
ions bound. In the highest resolution structure we modeled 381 water molecules.
Structures of Nsp3 PLpro were reported previously for SARS-, MERS-CoV, and other viruses 27.
The CoV-2 PLpro structure has “thumb–palm–fingers” architecture described before (Fig. 1). This
arrangement is similar to the ubiquitin specific proteases (USPs), one of the five distinct
deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) families, despite low sequence identities (~10%)

10,27

. Briefly, the

protein has two distinct domains: the small N-terminal ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain and the “thumb–
palm–fingers” catalytic domain (Fig. 1). The Ubl domain consists of residues 1 to 60 with five bstrands, one a-helix, and one 310-helix. In CoV-2 PLpro, chloride ion binds to a small loop formed
by residues Thr9 – Ile14 at the interface with the catalytic domain. In different structures, Ub1 shows
some conformational flexibility, though the specific function of this domain is not well understood.
The larger catalytic domain is an extended right-hand scaffold with three characteristic
subdomains. A thumb is comprised of six a-helices and a small b-hairpin. The fingers subdomain is
the most complex; it is made of six b-strands and two a-helices and includes a zinc binding site. This

structural zinc ion is coordinated by four cysteines located on two loops (Cys189, 192, 224, and 226)
of two b-hairpins. Zinc binding is essential for structural integrity and protease activity 28, but the
conformation of this region varies most between different PLpro structures. The palm subdomain is
comprised of six b-strands (Fig. 1) with the catalytic residues Cys111, His272, and Asp286 located
at the interface between the thumb and palm subdomains (Fig. 1). An important mobile β-turn/loop
(Gly266 – Gly271) is adjacent to the active site that closes upon substrate and/or inhibitor binding.
In the high resolution structure of PLpro C111S mutant, there is a phosphate ion bound to the active
site at the N-terminus of helix a4 (contributing Cys111) that is coordinated by Trp106, Asn109, and
His272. This site provides a good environment to stabilize C-terminal carboxylate group of the
peptide cleavage product. In this structure, there is another phosphate ion bound to a thumb
subdomain and is coordinated by His73 and His170. This subdomain also binds a second chloride
ion near Arg140. In the structures with inhibitors there are additional zinc and chloride ions bound,
including one in the active site that is coordinated by the active site Cys111.
We compared our structures with the high resolution crystal structures of SARS and MERS
PLpro. The SARS PLpro Cys112Ser mutant in complex with ubiquitin (PDB id: 4M0W) shows
RMSD 0.53 Å with our highest resolution structure of CoV-2 PLpro C111S mutant (PDB id: 6WRH).
The largest differences are observed, in our lower resolution wild-type structure, in zinc binding
region, consistent with this region being the most flexible in the PLpro structures. A comparison of
MERS PLpro high resolution structure (PDB id: 4RNA) with CoV-2 PLpro C111S mutant shows
much bigger differences (RMSD 1.82 Å), with the largest structural shifts occurring again in the
structural zinc-binding region and also in the N-terminal Ubl domain. The PLpro core shows
analogous differences with RMSD 1.72 Å (PDB id: 5KO3). In compared structures, as expected, side
chains of many surface residues show different conformations. Nevertheless, the arrangement of the
catalytic site is very similar in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, suggesting that at least some inhibitors
may display cross activity between these proteases. The MERS PLpro active site region differs quite
significantly from SARS PLpro enzymes and at least some SARS-specific inhibitors may not cross
react.

Several naphthalene-based compounds were synthesized (Supplemental Fig. 2) and tested for
inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro activity (Supplemental Fig. 3). One of these compounds (1/
GRL0617) was identified previously as a specific SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitor and showed good
potency and low cytotoxicity in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells 29. We present in this manuscript
results of biochemical, whole cell, and high resolution crystallographic studies of seven compounds,
six possessing the methyl-N-[(1R)-1-naphthalen-1-ylethyl]benzamide scaffold and one being a
simplified analog of our own design. All these compounds inhibit SARS-CoV-2 PLpro protease and
they are designated as follows: 1 is 5-amino-2-methyl-N-[(1R)-1-naphthalen-1-ylethyl]benzamide
(GRL0617), 2 is 5-carbamylurea-2-methyl-N-[(1R)-1-naphthalen-1-ylethyl]benzamide,

3 is 5-

acrylamide-2-methyl-N-[(1R)-1-naphthalen-1-ylethyl]benzamide, 4 is 3-amino-N-(naphthalene-1yl)-5-trifluoromethyl)benzamide, 5 is 5-(butylcarbamoylamino)-2-methyl-N-[(1R)-1-naphthalen-1ylethyl]benzamide, 6 is 5-(((4-nitrophenoxy)carbonyl)amino)-2-methyl-N-[(1R)-1-naphthalen-1ylethyl]benzamide, and 7 is 5-pentanoylamino-2-methyl-N-[(1R)-1-naphthalen-1-ylethyl]benzamide
(Fig. 2, Supplemental Fig. 2A).
We have developed an in vitro biochemical assay for PLpro using expressed protein and a profluorescent peptide substrate, CV-2, designed based on the LKGG recognition motif of PLpro
(Supplemental Figs. 2B and 3). CV-2 generates fluorescent signal in response the protease activity of
PLpro, and critically, is unresponsive in the C111S variant (Supplementary Fig. 3). In this assay all
seven compounds act as non-covalent inhibitors of the enzyme. Given that compound 1/GRL0617 is
known to inhibit SARS-CoV PLpro with an IC50 value of 0.6 µM 29, we expected it would likely
inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 enzyme and indeed it does so, with an IC50 value of 2.3 µM in our assay
conditions (Fig. 2). Compounds 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 are further amine-functionalized derivatives of
1/GRL0617, while 4 is a simplified variant of 1 without a chirality center (Supplemental Fig. 2A);
despite their structural differences, we found that all inhibit PLpro to varying degrees (IC50 = 5.1–
32.8 µM, Fig. 2). Given this suite of molecules that function as PLpro inhibitors in vitro, we next
sought to test whether these molecules are also capable of inhibiting viral replication in live cells.

Whole cell virus replication assays
We next performed CoV-2 virus replication assays using Vero E6 cells and measuring SARS
CoV-2 replication. Surprisingly, not all compounds functioned in this assay, and their relative

abilities to inhibit viral replication did not necessarily correlate directly with in vitro inhibition
parameters toward PLpro. Compounds 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 all proved capable of affecting the viability
of cells and inhibiting virus replication. For compounds 1, 4, and 7 their EC50 values range from 1.5
to 8.0 µM (Fig. 3A and 3B, and Supplemental Fig. 4). For example, PLpro inhibition by compound
1/GRL0617 is 14-times better than 4, but inhibition of virus replication is only two times higher.
Moreover, compounds 2 and 3 are quite good inhibitors (IC50 values of 5.1 and 6.4 µM, respectively),
but failed in the viral replication assay. Compound 5 was the weakest inhibitor in vitro (IC50 values
of 32.8 µM), but was one of the best performers in the live viral replication assay (EC50 2.5 µM).
Differences in cell permeability and solubility could account for the disconnects between the in
vitro biochemical assay data and viral replication data, but given the high degree of structural
similarity between these molecules, these data indicate that further optimization is possible,
especially in the case of compound 5, which is a relatively weak binder but solid inhibitor of the virus.
More broadly, all of the compounds are promising and may need only small modification(s) in order
to serve as preclinical lead compounds. To enable structure-based improvements of these molecules,
we next aimed to get ligand-bound structures of as many of these lead compounds as possible. Based
on these results, we believe it is critical to combine the in vitro biochemical assays to triage
compounds with live viral replication assays.

Crystal structures with bound compounds 1, 2 and 3
We were able to determine crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro with non-covalent inhibitors
1, 2, and 3 (Supplemental Table 1) three using C111S mutant and one wild-type enzyme (PDB ids:
7JIR, 7JIT, 7JIV, 7JIW). The structure with compound 3 was solved in both wild-type and mutant
forms. The electron density for the ligand, protein, solvent, and bound acetate ion is excellent (Fig.
4). All three compounds bind to the same site as observed previously for GRL0617 in complex with
SARS-CoV PLpro (PDB id: 3E9S) 29 and now determined for 1 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 PLpro
(Fig. 4A). The structure of 2 bound to the PLpro C111S mutant was determined at 1.95 Å (PDB id:
7JIT), the highest resolution for all complexes to date, and this structure will be used here as a
reference (Fig. 4B and Supplemental Fig. 5A). Compound 2 binds to the groove on the surface of
PLpro near the active site, ~8 Å apart from Cys/Ser111, overlapping with S4/S3 protein subsites
(corresponding the substrate positions P4/P3), that are critical for recognition of the leucine residue

in the LXGG motif (Fig. 4E). The ubiquitin peptide-binding site is a solvent-exposed groove: wide
at S4 site, solvent exposed at P3 site, and very narrow at P2 and P1 sites (Fig. 4E). Because of the
high resolution achieved, we observe extensive interactions between compound 2 and the protein
involving direct as well as water-mediated hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts, noting some
additional interactions provided by the carbamylurea moiety in 2. As compared with unliganded
protein, the main chain and side chains of several residues significantly adjust to accommodate the
ligand (Arg166, Glu167, Tyr268, Gln269, Fig. 4B and Supplemental Fig. 5A). Direct hydrogen
bonds are found between Glu167 and Tyr268 and two nitrogen and oxygen atoms of the carbamylurea
moiety, respectively (Fig. 4B). As compared with 1/GRL0617 compound 2 makes all the same
interactions and provides additional four hydrogen bonds. Intriguingly, however, the IC50 value for
1 is ~2 times lower than for 2, despite 2 making more interactions with the protein. Asp164 hydrogen
bonds with another amino group in the linker between two aromatic rings and main-chain amino
group of Gln269 hydrogen bonds to oxygen atom of that linker. Lys157 makes water-mediated
hydrogen bond to the carbamylurea moiety. This water molecule also coordinates Glu167.
Interestingly, this residue (equivalent of Glu168 in SARS PLpro) seems to play an important role in
Ub1 core recognition, and mutations can cause a significant loss of DUB activity.
The aromatic rings of 2 make several hydrophobic interactions, specifically with Pro248, Tyr268,
aliphatic regions of the side chain of Gln269, and Asp164. Curiously, there is also an acetate ion
packing in between 2 and protein residues. This ion is coordinated by Arg166 and Glu167. The ligand
binding site offers a number of opportunities to improve ligand affinity (water and acetate binding
site) and potential linking to the active site for covalent attachment, many of which were not explicitly
indicated by previous work with SARS.
The structures of inhibitor 3 were determined in both forms: wild-type at 2.30 Å (PDB id: 7JIW)
and C111S mutant at 2.05 Å (PDB id: 7JIV) (Fig. 4C). The structures of protein, the pose, and overall
interactions of the inhibitor are the same in both variants. Compound 3 is a derivative of 1, in which
its amino moiety is functionalized to become an acrylamide. Structural comparison shows that only
some interactions are preserved – all hydrophobic interactions and one hydrogen bond. The
acrylamide moiety in 3 provides two additional hydrogen bonds as compared to 1. Thus far, we have
not been able to grow crystals of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro with compound 4. However, we were able to
model the interaction of 4 with the protein (Fig. 4D), where it appears that the trifluoromethyl moiety

is able to interact with the amide group of Gln269. Given that several other analogs of 4 (structures
not shown here) are inactive in biochemical studies, this interaction might be significant.
The inhibitory effect of compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 can be easily rationalized as they anchor to the
site. Although somewhat away from the catalytic triad, their binding still interferes with the
recognition of peptide motif LXGG. Comparison with the high resolution structure of PLpro with
ubiquitin (PDB id: 4M0W) shows that the inhibitor linker region connecting naphthalene and benzene
rings overlaps with the leucine residue of ubiquitin C-terminal sequence bound to the S4 subsite (Fig.
4E and supplemental Fig. 5B). The S4 site is where specificity of the LXGG peptide is determined
as it recognizes leucine side chain by fitting it into hydrophobic pocket formed by Pro248, Tyr264,
Tyr272 and Thr301. These residues are conserved in SARS CoV-1 and CoV-2 PLpro, but only
Tyr272 and Thr301 are conserved in SARS and MERS PLpro (Supplemental Fig. 1). Therefore,
ligands that bind to hydrophobic S4 site and make hydrophilic interactions with PLpro surface
residues may be good candidates for inhibitors of the PLpro enzyme. The S3 site can accept any
residue because it is solvent exposed, but would prefer hydrophilic side chain (Arg, Lys, Asn). The
peptide then follows the path to the active site that becomes narrower and can accept only two glycine
residues in P1 and P2. The P1’ again is on the protein surface and can accept any residue. The
interesting requirement is that the peptide binding to S1 – S4 sites must be in extended/linear
conformation, placing noteworthy constrains on designing inhibitors targeting the active site.

Conclusions

In summary in this report we have presented a substantial high resolution structural, biochemical,
and virus replication studies of PLpro cysteine protease from SARS-CoV-2 and describe seven
compounds that inhibit enzyme in in vitro biochemical assay based on the cleavage of the LXGG
recognition peptide, a subset of these inhibit virus replication. We have determined apo-structures of
wild-type enzyme and inactive mutant in which single sulfur atom was replaced by oxygen (C111S).
The apo and mutant structures were determined at high resolution 1.79 and 1.60 Angstroms providing
detailed and accurate three-dimensional models of the enzyme.

The mutant structures were

determined under both 100K and 293K temperatures providing information about protein flexibility.
All four apo-PLpro structures showed significant structural conservation, including catalytic triad and
ordered solvent molecules. The protein surface provides rich chemical environment and is capable of

binding a variety of ions including conserved structural zinc ion, few non-structural zinc ions, several
phosphate, chloride and acetate anions. The structures of complexes with inhibitors 1, 2, and 3 were
determined at 1.95–2.30 Angstroms, including compound 3 in both wild-type and mutant forms. All
three ligands bind to the same site in the enzyme located 8 - 10 Å away from the catalytic cysteine
and it is expected that all seven synthetic compounds bind in a very similar manner. Based on this
assumption we have modelled pose of compound 4 in the structure. Considerable conformational
adjustments are observed for the side chains of residues involved in ligand binding. These inhibitors
bind to protease S4/S3 sites. The S4 site is where specificity of the LXGG sequence recognition motif
is determined as it recognizes leucine side chain by fitting it into hydrophobic pocket. This site is
only partly conserved between SARS CoV and MERS CoV enzymes explaining lack of cross
reactivity of compound 1 reported previously. Binding inhibitors to this site would block peptide
recognition. The PLpro peptide binding site narrows significantly as it approaches catalytic triad
explaining why only glycine residues are accepted at the C-terminus of the recognition motif. These
compounds would not only prevent virus polyproteins processing but also cleavage of host proteins
modifications with ubiquitin and ISG15, therefore inhibit several PLpro functions. Five out of seven
inhibitors of PLpro block virus replication in whole cell assay. Interestingly, their relative abilities to
inhibit viral replication do not directly correlate with in vitro inhibition of PLpro, suggesting that
other factors are important. Nevertheless our studies showed potential S4/S3 site binders to serve as
scaffolds for effective inhibitors of SARS CoV-2 coronavirus. Our collection of structures provides
fundamental molecular and mechanistic insight into PLpro structure and it illustrates details ligand
recognition and interactions. These collated findings will accelerate further structure-based drug
design efforts targeting PLpro, with the ultimate goal of identifying high-affinity inhibitors of clinical
value for SARS-CoV-2.

Supplemental Materials

Materials and methods
Gene cloning, protein expression and purification of WT and C111S mutant of PLpro
The gene cloning, protein expression and purification were performed as reported previously
1

. Briefly, the Nsp3 DNA sequence corresponding to PLpro protease SARS-CoV-2 was optimized

for E. coli expression using the OptimumGene codon optimization algorithm followed by manual
editing and then cloned directly into pMCSG53 vector (Twist Bioscience). The plasmids were
transformed into the E. coli BL21(DE3)-Gold strain (Stratagene). E. coli cells harboring plasmids
for SARS CoV-2 PLpro WT and C111S mutant expression were cultured in LB medium
supplemented with ampicillin (150 µg/mL).
Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7,000g and cell pellets were resuspended in
a 12.5 ml lysis buffer (500 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 20 mM imidazole
pH8.0, 1mM TCEP, 1 µM ZnCl₂) per liter culture and sonicated at 120W for 5 minutes (4 sec ON,
20 sec OFF). The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 30,000g for 90 minutes at 4 °C.
The supernatant was mixed with 3 ml of Ni2+ Sepharose (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) which
had been equilibrated with lysis buffer supplemented to 50 mM imidazole pH 8.0, and the
suspension was applied on Flex-Column (420400-2510) connected to Vac-Man vacuum manifold
(Promega). Unbound proteins were washed out via controlled suction with 160 ml of lysis buffer
(with 50 mM imidazole pH 8.0). Bound proteins were eluted with 15 mL of lysis buffer
supplemented to 500 mM imidazole pH 8.0, followed by Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease
treatment at 1:25 protease:protein ratio. The solutions were left at 4 °C overnight. The proteins
were run separately on a Superdex 75 column equilibrated in lysis buffer. Fractions containing
cut protein were collected and applied on Flex-Columns with 3 mL of Ni2+ Sepharose which had
been equilibrated with lysis buffer. The flow through and a 7 mL lysis buffer rinse were collected.
Lysis buffer was replaced using 30 kDa MWCO filters (Amicon-Millipore) via 10X
concentration/dilution repeated 3 times to crystallization buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES
pH 7.5, 1 µM ZnCl₂, 4 mM TCEP). Purification was repeated for PLpro WT and C111S mutant
proteins for co-crystallization with the inhibitor 3, following the same protocol except that 10 mM
β-mercaptoethanol was used instead of TCEP in all purification buffers, and 10 mM DTT was

used instead of TCEP in the crystallization buffer. The final concentrations of WT PLpro was 25
mg/mL and C111S mutant was 30 mg/mL.
Fluorescence-based biochemical assays
Dose response assays were performed in 96-well plate format in triplicate at 25 °C. Wells
containing varying concentrations of PLpro enzyme (0-1 µM) in Tris-HCl pH 7.3, 1 mM EDTA
were mixed with LKGG-AMC probe substrate (40 µM) and measured continuously for
fluorescence emission intensity (excitation λ: 364 nm; emission λ: 440 nm) on a Synergy Neo2
Hybrid. PLpro-WT and PLpro-C111S activities on LKGG-AMC were assayed as above with 1
µM enzyme and 40 µM LKGG-AMC substrate.
PLpro inhibition assay
Inhibition assays were performed in a 96-well plate format in triplicate at 25 °C. Reactions
containing varying concentrations of inhibitor (0-500 µM) and PLpro enzyme (0.3 µM) in TrisHCl pH 7.3, 1 mM EDTA were incubated for approximately five minutes. Reactions were then
initiated with LKGG-AMC probe substrate (40 µM), shaken linearly for 5 s, and then measured
continuously for fluorescence emission intensity (excitation λ: 364 nm; emission λ: 440 nm) on a
Synergy Neo2 Hybrid. Data were fit using nonlinear regression (dose-response inhibition, variable
slope) analysis in GraphPad Prism 7.0.
PLpro crystallization
The sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method was used with the help of the Mosquito liquid
dispenser (TTP LabTech) in 96-well CrystalQuick plates (Greiner Bio-One). Crystallizations were
performed with the protein-to-matrix ratio of 1:1. MCSG1, MCSG2, MCSG3, and MCSG4
(Anatrace) screens were used for protein crystallization at 16 °C and 4 °C. The first thin-plate
crystals grew in multiple conditions after 1-3 days of incubation at 4 °C. The best crystals of wildtype protein (C2 space group) were obtained from MCSG4 screen, reagent formulation #96 (0.2
M magnesium acetate, 10% PEG 8000). The crystals of PLpro-C111S mutant protein (bipyramidal

crystals up to 0.2 mm, 1-3 days of incubation at 4 °C, P3221 space group) were obtained from
MCSG2 screen, reagent formulation #4 (0.1 M acetate buffer pH 4.5, 0.8 M NaH2PO4/1.2 M
K2HPO4). The mutant crystals were used for seeding WT protein crystallization droplets to obtain

crystals with significantly improved diffraction. For co-crystallization with inhibitors, proteins (15
mg/ml) were mixed with inhibitors at 10x protein concentration for a final inhibitor concentration
of 4 mM, incubated on ice for 2.5 hours, and spun down to remove precipitation. Crystals (I4122
space group) formed at 4 °C with a protein-to-matrix ratio of 2:1 in hanging drops in 0.1 M MES
pH 6.0, 50 mM zinc acetate, 10% PEG 8000. Crystals selected for data collection were washed in
the crystallization buffer supplemented with either 25% glycerol (apo-protein crystals) or 25%
ethylene glycol (protein-inhibitor crystals) and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen.
Data collection, structure determination and refinement
Single-wavelength x-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K temperature at the 19-ID
beamline of the Structural Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National
Laboratory using the program SBCcollect. The diffraction images were recorded from all crystal
forms on the PILATUS3 X 6M detector using 0.3° rotation and 0.3 sec exposure (with the
exception of the first WT PLpro crystal where data were collected using 0.5° rotation and 0.5 sec
exposure). The intensities were integrated and scaled with the HKL3000 suite 2. Intensities were
converted to structure factor amplitudes in the truncate program 3,4 from the CCP4 package 5. The
structures were determined by molecular replacement using HKL3000 suite incorporating the
following programs: MOLREP 6, SOLVE/RESOLVE 7 and ARP/wARP 8. The initial solutions
were refined, both rigid-body refinement and regular restrained refinement by REFMAC program
9

as a part of HKL3000. The coordinates of SARS coronavirus PLpro (PDB id: 5Y3Q) were used

as the starting model for the first wild-type protein structure solution. Several rounds of manual
adjustments of structure models using COOT 10 and refinements with REFMAC program 9 from
CCP4 suite 5 were done. The models including the ligands were manually adjusted using COOT
and then iteratively refined using COOT and REFMAC. The stereochemistry of the structure was
validated with PHENIX suite 11 incorporating MOLPROBITY 12 tools. Throughout the refinement,
the same 5% of reflections were kept out from the refinement. The stereochemistry of the structure
was checked with PROCHECK

13

and the Ramachandran plot and validated with the PDB

validation server. A summary of data collection and refinement statistics is given in Supplemental
Table 1.

Synthesis of Compound 1 (GRL0617)
To a suspension of the 5-nitro-o-toluic acid (0.362 g, 2.00 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in CH2Cl2 (10.0
mL) at 0 °C was added (COCl)2 (0.206 mL, 2.40 mmol, 1.2 equiv) dropwise before catalytic DMF
(8 drops from a 1.00 mL syringe) was added dropwise. This mixture was then stirred at 0 °C for
30 min before being concentrated directly. The resultant residue was then redissolved in CH2Cl2
(20.0 mL) at 23 °C before the sequential addition of (R)-(+)-1-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine (0.417 mL,
2.60 mmol, 1.3 equiv) and Et3N (0.558 mL, 4.00 mmol, 2.0 equiv). The reaction mixture was then
stirred at 23 °C for 30 min. Upon completion, the reaction contents were quenched by the addition
of 1 M HCl (30 mL), diluted with CH2Cl2 (10 mL), and poured into a separatory funnel. The two
phases were separated, and the organic layer was washed with 1 M NaOH (3 × 30 mL). The
organic extract was then dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated. Purification of the resultant

intermediate (0.430 g, 1.29 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in MeOH (30.0 mL) at 23 °C. The resultant
suspension was then purged by direct bubbling with a balloon of H2 gas for 2 h at 23 °C. Upon
completion, the reaction contents were filtered through a short pad of Celite, washed with EtOAc
(200 mL), and dried (Na2SO4) to directly provide inhibitor 1 (0.328 g, 84% yield) as a white solid.

Synthesis of Compound 4
3-nitro-5-(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid (0.752 g, 3.20 mmol, 1.0 equiv) was suspended in
CH2Cl2 (14 mL) under an argon atmosphere at 23 °C. Then, DMF (2 drops) was added, followed
by slow addition of oxalyl chloride (0.300 mL, 0.444 g, 3.50 mmol, 1.1 equiv). The resulting
solution was stirred at 23 °C for 1 h before complete dissolution of the starting material was
observed. The mixture was then concentrated to dryness, back-filled with argon, redissolved in
CH2Cl2 (10 mL) and cooled to 0 °C. Then, naphthylamine (0.500 g, 3.49 mmol, 1.1 equiv) was
added in a single portion and the solution was warmed to 23 °C and stirred vigorously at this
temperature for 2 h. The resulting precipitate was filtered and washed with cold CH2Cl2 (2 ´ 10
mL). The CH2Cl2-containing filtrate was discarded, and the filter cake was then thoroughly washed
with warm (50 °C) EtOAc (4 ´ 20 mL). The filtrate was concentrated to afford the desired amide

washed by aqueous HCl (pH ~2-3). The aqueous layer was further extracted by EtOAc (2 ´ 20
mL), the combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4, and then evaporated to give a crude
product. Purification by column chromatography (silica gel, 2-15% MeOH in 1:1 EtOAc:CH2Cl2)
yielded S6 (9.7 mg, 56% yield). S6: 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 10.18 (s, 1 H), 8.39–8.30

evaporation. Dilution with CH2Cl2 (5 mL) and solvent removal by rotary evaporation was repeated
two more times to remove residual TFA. The crude was dissolved in DMSO to generate 20 mM
stock of CV-2. Purity was assayed by LC/MS. CV-2: HRMS (ESI) calculated for C28H40N6O7 [M+]
572.2958, found 572.2956.
Cells and Virus
Vero E6 cells (ATCC) were infected under biosafety level 3 conditions with SARS-CoV-2
(nCoV/Washington/1/2020, kindly provided by the National Biocontainment Laboratory,
Galveston, TX).
Immunostaining against Spike protein
Immunostaining was performed on 10% NBF fixed SARS-CoV-2 infected cells in 96-well
plate. After fixation, 10% NBF was removed, and cells were washed with PBS, followed by
washing with PBS-T (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS), and then blocked for 30 min with PBS containing
1% BSA at 23 °C. After blocking, endogenous peroxidases were quenched by 3% hydrogen
peroxide for 5 min. Then, cells were washed with PBS and PBS-T and incubated with a
monoclonal mouse-anti- SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody (GeneTex, 1:1000) in PBS containing 1%
BSA overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibody was washed with PBS and PBS-T and then cells were
incubated in secondary antibody (ImmPRESS Horse Anti-Mouse IgG Polymer Reagent,
Peroxidase; Vector Laboratories) for 60 min at 23 °C. After washing with PBS for 10 min, color
development was achieved by applying diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) solution
(Metal Enhanced DAB Substrate Kit; ThermoFisher Scientific) for 30 min and observed by light
microscopy for the percentage of cells that were Spike positive.
