Abstract
Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out genetic screens are powerful approaches to unravel new
regulators of viral infections. Here, we took advantage of the ability of interferon (IFN) to restrict
HIV-1 infection, in order to create an environment hostile to replication and reveal new inhibitors
through a CRISPR screen. This approach led to the identification of the RNA helicase DDX42 as
an intrinsic inhibitor of HIV-1. Depletion of endogenous DDX42 increased HIV-1 DNA
accumulation and infection in cell lines and primary cells, irrespectively of IFN treatment. DDX42
overexpression inhibited HIV-1, whereas a dominant-negative mutant of DDX42 increased
infection. Importantly, DDX42 impacted retrotransposition of long interspersed elements-1 (LINE1), infection with other retroviruses and positive-strand RNA viruses, including Chikungunya virus
(CHIKV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, DDX42
did not inhibit infection with negative-strand RNA viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV),
arguing against a general, unspecific effect on target cells. Proximity ligation assays
showed DDX42 in the vicinity of viral elements during infection, and RNA immunoprecipitation
confirmed DDX42 interaction with LINE-1 RNAs. This strongly suggested a direct mode of action
of DDX42 on viral ribonucleoprotein complexes. Taken together, our results identify DDX42 as a
new, broadly active intrinsic antiviral inhibitor.

Introduction
Over the past 20 years, a growing list of cellular proteins with various functions have been
identified as capable of limiting different steps of virus life cycles, including HIV-1 (Chemudupati
et al., 2019; Doyle et al., 2015; Ghimire et al., 2018). Viruses have often evolved to counteract
the action of these so-called restriction factors. However, type 1 interferons (IFNs) induce, through
the expression of interferon-stimulated genes, an antiviral state particularly efficient at inhibiting
HIV-1 when cells are pre-exposed to IFN (Doyle et al., 2015). The dynamin-like GTPase MX2,
and, recently, the restriction factor TRIM5a, have both been shown to participate in this IFNinduced inhibition (Goujon et al., 2013a; Kane et al., 2013; OhAinle et al., 2018; JimenezGuardeño et al., 2019). With the hypothesis that additional HIV-1 inhibitors remained to be
identified, we took advantage of the hostile environment induced by IFN to develop a wholegenome, CRISPR/Cas9 screen strategy in order to reveal such inhibitors. This strategy led us to
identify DDX42 as a new intrinsic inhibitor of HIV-1, also capable of inhibiting a range of other
positive RNA viruses.

Results
The Genome-Scale CRISPR Knock-Out (GeCKO) sgRNA library (Sanjana et al., 2014; Shalem
et al., 2014, 2015) was used to generate knock-out populations in the glioblastoma T98G cell line.
This cell line is both highly permissive to HIV-1 infection and potently able to suppress infection
following IFN treatment (Figure S1A). The screen strategy is depicted in Figure 1A. Cas9expressing T98G cells were independently transduced with lentiviral vectors (LVs) coding the
two-halves of the GeCKO library, at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI). Next-generation
sequencing showed more than 94% sgRNA coverage for each sub-library (not shown). Cells were
pre-treated with type 1 IFN and incubated with VSV-G-pseudotyped, HIV-1 based LVs coding for
an antibiotic resistance cassette. The cells successfully infected despite the IFN treatment were
selected by cell survival in the presence of antibiotics. In order to enrich the population with
mutants of interest and to limit the presence of false-positives, two additional rounds of IFN

cells enriched after each round became less refractory to HIV-1 infection following IFN treatment
(Figure S1B).

Figure 1. A whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 screen to identify new HIV-1 inhibitors.
A. Screen strategy. GeCKO cell populations (obtained by transduction of T98G/Cas9 cells with GeCKO v2 LV
library) were IFN-treated, challenged with HIV-1 LVs coding an antibiotic resistance gene and selected. Three
rounds of IFN treatment, infection and selection were performed. Genomic DNAs of initial GeCKO and 3-time
selected populations were extracted, the sgRNA-coding sequences amplified and sequenced.
B. Candidate gene identification. MAGeCK computational statistical tool (Li et al., 2014) was used to establish a
Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA) score for each gene based on sgRNA enrichment and number of sgRNAs per
gene. Genes belonging to type 1 IFN response pathway (in blue) and DDX42 (in red) are shown (respective
ranks into brackets) for 2 independent screens (the results of which were merged in the analysis).
C. Candidate validation. T98G/Cas9/CD4/CXCR4 /Firefly KO populations were generated for the 25 top hits of
each screen. The control (CTRL) condition represents the mean of 4 negative CTRL populations, obtained with
4 non-targeting sgRNAs; IFNAR1 and MX2 KO populations were used as positive controls. KO cell populations
were treated with IFN and infected with HIV-1 Renilla and luciferase signals were measured 24 h later (Renilla
signals were normalized to Firefly). IFN inhibition (i.e. ratio of untreated / IFN-treated conditions) was calculated
and set at 100% inhibition for CTRL. A representative experiment is shown (mean and standard deviation from
technical duplicates).

The differential sgRNA abundance between the initial GeCKO populations and selected
populations was analysed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the MAGeCK algorithm was
used to rank the gene candidates (Figure 1B). An enrichment was observed for 200 genes (RRA
score > 0,01), with the best hits being IFNAR1, JAK1 and STAT2 (Figure 1B). The crucial
mediators of type 1 IFN signalling cascade were among the top hits in both screens (with the
notable exception of STAT1), validating our approach and confirming the identification of relevant
genes. Interestingly, most of the other candidates displayed unknown functions, or functions that
were a priori unrelated to innate immunity. Of note, very little overlap was observed between the
two independent screens, performed with two sub-libraries. However, such a poor overlap
between biological replicates does not preclude obtaining valid data (Doench, 2018). The top 25
candidate genes from each screen were selected for further validation. T98G/Cas9 cells
expressing HIV-1 CD4 and CXCR4 receptors, as well as firefly luciferase as an internal control
(T98G/Cas9/CD4/CXCR4/Firefly cells), were transduced with sgRNA-expressing LVs to generate
individual KO populations, using the identified sgRNA sequences. Four irrelevant, non-targeting
sgRNAs, as well as sgRNAs targeting IFNAR1 and MX2, were used to generate negative and
positive control populations, respectively. The KO cell populations were pre-treated with IFN and
infected with an HIV-1 reporter virus expressing Renilla luciferase reporter and bearing HIV-1
envelope (hereafter called HIV-1 Renilla). Infection efficiency was analysed 30 h later (Figure 1C).
As expected, IFNAR1 and MX2 KO fully and partially rescued HIV-1 infection from the protective
effect of IFN, respectively (Goujon et al., 2013a; Bulli et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2018). The KO of two
candidate genes, namely WARS2 and DDX42, allowed a partial rescue of HIV-1 infection from
the IFN-induced inhibition, suggesting a potential role of these candidate genes.

DDX42 is a member of the DExD/H box family of RNA helicases, with RNA chaperone activities
(Uhlmann-Schiffler et al., 2006) and, as such, retained our attention. Indeed, DEAD box helicases
are well-known to regulate HIV-1 life cycle (Taschuk and Cherry, 2020). However, to our
knowledge, the impact of DDX42 on HIV-1 replication had never been studied. In order to validate
the effect of DDX42 KO on HIV-1 infection in another model cell line, two additional sgRNAs were

designed (sgRNA-2 and -3) and used in parallel to the one identified in the GeCKO screen
(sgDDX42-1) (Figure 2A). U87-MG/CD4/CXCR4 cells were used here, as we previously
extensively characterized the IFN phenotype in these cells (Goujon et al., 2013a). Control and
DDX42 KO cell populations were pre-treated or not with IFN prior to infection HIV-1 Renilla.
DDX42 depletion improved HIV-1 infection with all three sgRNAs, confirming that endogenous
DDX42 had a negative impact on HIV-1 infection. Interestingly, the increase in infection efficiency
induced by DDX42 KO was observed irrespectively of the IFN treatment. DDX42 is not an ISG
(Figure S2A and GSE46599 (Goujon et al., 2013a)) but the fact that the IFN-induced state is at
least partially saturable (Figure S1A) explains why an intrinsic inhibitor of HIV-1, which is not
regulated by IFN, could be identified by our approach. Indeed, removing one barrier to infection
presumably rendered the cells more permissive and, in this context, IFN had less of an impact.

G. Firefly- or DDX42-expresssing U87-MG/CD4/CXCR4 cells were infected with HIV-1 Renilla. Relative infection

A-G Data represent the mean ± S.E.M of three independent experiments.

In order to confirm DDX42’s effect on HIV-1 infection with an independent approach, we used 3
different siRNAs to knockdown DDX42 expression. We observed that depleting DDX42 (with
~90% efficiency both at the mRNA and protein levels, Figure 2B) increased HIV-1 Renilla infection
efficiency by 3 to 8-fold in U87-MG/CD4/CXCR4 cells, irrespectively of the presence of IFN
(Figure 2C). Of note, wild-type HIV-1 infection was also impacted by DDX42 silencing, as shown
by Capsid (p24Gag) intracellular staining 30h post-infection (Figure 2D). We then investigated
whether DDX42 had an impact in HIV-1 primary target cells. In monocyte-derived macrophages
(MDMs), we observed that HIV-1 infection was increased by about 2-fold following DDX42
silencing (Figure 2E), whereas DDX42 mRNA abundance was decreased by only 40% (Figure
S2B). Electroporation of pre-assembled Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) was
used to efficiently deplete DDX42 in primary CD4+ T cells (Figure 2F). DDX42 depletion increased
HIV-1 infection by 2- to 3-fold, showing a role of DDX42 as an intrinsic inhibitor of HIV-1 in primary
CD4+ T cells. We next analysed the consequences of DDX42 overexpression on HIV-1 infection.
An irrelevant control (Firefly) or DDX42 were ectopically expressed in U87-MG/CD4/CXCR4 and
the cells were challenged with HIV-1 (Figure 2G). DDX42 overexpression induced a substantial
inhibition of HIV-1 infection (~5-fold decrease in infection efficiency in comparison to the control).

Interestingly, the expression of K303E DDX42 mutant, which is unable to hydrolyse ATP and may
supposedly act as a dominant negative (Granneman et al., 2006; Rocak, 2005), increased HIV-1
infection by 3-fold, reminiscent of the impact of DDX42 depletion (Figure S2C). Altogether, these
data showed that endogenous DDX42 is able to intrinsically inhibit HIV-1 infection.

In order to determine the step of HIV-1 life cycle affected by DDX42, we quantified HIV-1 DNA
accumulation over time in DDX42-silenced and control cells (Figure 3A; silencing efficiency is
shown in Figure 3B). DDX42 depletion increased accumulation of early and late reverse transcript
products (by 2.5- to 8-fold), as well as proviral DNA and 2-long terminal repeat (2-LTR) circles at
48h post-infection (by 2.5- to 4.5-fold). Importantly, DDX42 silencing did not impact HIV-1 entry
(Figure S3A). These data suggested that DDX42 could inhibit reverse transcription and/or impact
genome stability, leading to a decrease in viral DNA accumulation. We hypothesized that if that
was the case, DDX42 should be found in close proximity to HIV-1 reverse transcription complexes
during infection. In agreement with this, proximity ligation assay (PLA) performed on HIV-1
infected MDMs showed that DDX42 could indeed be found in close vicinity of Capsid (Figure 3C).

We next examined the ability of DDX42 to inhibit infection by various primate lentiviruses,
including lab-adapted strains of HIV-1 (NL4-3, IIIB), transmitted/founders (CH077.t, CH106.c,
REJO.c), HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus from rhesus macaque (SIVMAC). DDX42 was
depleted or not in TZM-bl reporter cells prior to infection with VSV-G-pseudotyped lentiviruses,
and infection efficiency was monitored 24h later (Figure 3D-E). DDX42 depletion increased
infection levels similarly with all the tested strains of HIV-1 (i.e. 3- to 5-fold). HIV-2rod10 and
SIVMAC infection efficiencies were also slightly improved in the absence of DDX42 (~2-fold). The
analysis was then extended to non-primate lentiviruses, equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV)
and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), using GFP-coding LVs (Figure S3B). DDX42 depletion
appeared to increase HIV-1, HIV-2 and FIV LV infection to the same extent (~2-fold), whereas
EIAV infection was less impacted. Of note, DDX42 antiviral activity appeared less potent on HIV1 LVs compared to full-length HIV-1, which might suggest that genome length or cis-acting

elements could play a role in DDX42 inhibition. We also observed that DDX42 depletion led to an
increase in infection with GFP-coding, murine leukemia virus (MLV)-derived vectors (Figure 3F).
These results strongly support a general antiviral activity of DDX42 against retroviruses.

DDX42 can be found in the cytoplasm but is predominantly located in the nucleus (Figure S3D;

activity against retroviruses and seemed to act at the level of reverse transcription, we sought to
investigate whether DDX42 could inhibit retrotransposons. Long interspersed nuclear elements
(LINE)-1 are non-LTR retrotransposons, which have been found to be active in the germ line and
some somatic cells (Faulkner and Billon, 2018). Interestingly, DDX42 was identified among the
suppressors of LINE-1 retrotransposition through a genome-wide screen in K562 cells, although
not further characterized (Liu et al., 2018). To confirm that DDX42 could inhibit LINE-1
retrotransposition, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with GFP-expressing LINE-1 plasmids
(RPS or LRE3) or an inactive LINE-1 (JM111) together with a DDX42- or a control (Firefly)expressing plasmid (Moran et al., 1996). LINE-1 retrotransposition was quantified by FACS 7
days later (Figure 3G). As the GFP cassette is cloned in antisense and disrupted by an intron,
GFP is only expressed after LINE-1 transcription, splicing, Orf2p-mediated reverse transcription,
and integration (Moran et al., 1996). Successful retrotransposition events were observed in
>1.25% of CTRL cells, but in only <0.25% of DDX42-expressing cells (i.e. a percentage similar to
what observed with the non-active LINE-1), showing that DDX42 ectopic expression suppressed
LINE-1 retrotransposition. Next, we investigated whether DDX42 could physically interact with
LINE-1 RNAs. Cells were co-transfected with RPS and either flag-tagged-Firefly or -DDX42, the
flagged proteins immunoprecipitated, and the proteins and associated RNAs were analysed by
immunoblot and RNA extraction and RT-qPCR, respectively (Figure 3H-I). DDX42 expression
decreased the total amount of LINE-1 RNAs but an enrichment of LINE-1 RNAs was observed
with DDX42 immunoprecipitation.

Finally, we sought to determine whether DDX42’s inhibitory activity was specific towards
retroviruses and retroelements, or could be extended to other viruses. To this aim, we tested the
impact of DDX42 depletion on RNA viruses from 5 different families: the orthomyxovirus influenza
A virus (IAV), the rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), the alphavirus CHIKV, the flavivirus
Zika virus (ZIKV), and the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which is responsible for the current
coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic (Figure 4). Strikingly, DDX42 depletion had no impact
on IAV or VSV replication (Figure 4A-B), thereby confirming that manipulating DDX42 expression
did not have a broad and unspecific impact on target cells. However, depletion of endogenous
DDX42 increased infection with ZIKV (Figure 4C), CHIKV and SARS-CoV-2, with a particularly
high impact on the latter two (up to 1 log and 3 log increase in infection efficiency with CHIKV and
SARS-CoV-2, respectively, Figure 4D and F-G; silencing efficiencies are shown in Figure 4E and
H). Plaque assays confirmed a strong impact of DDX42 depletion on infectious SARS-CoV-2
production (Figure 4G). In agreement with this, DDX42 was recently identified as a potential
inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 replication in a CRISPR screen in simian cells (Wei et al., 2020). Next,
we used PLA to determine whether DDX42 was in the vicinity of viral components in infected
cells. To this aim, PLA was performed with either anti-double strand (ds)RNA or antiNucleoprotein

(N)

antibody,

higher number of dsRNA-DDX42 and N-DDX42 PLA punctae than in control cells. This strongly
suggested an interaction between DDX42 and SARS-CoV-2 viral components.

Here, we identified for the first time the RNA helicase DDX42 as an intrinsic inhibitor of HIV-1,
capable of limiting the efficiency of viral DNA accumulation. Moreover, our study revealed broad
activity of endogenous DDX42 against retroviruses and retroelements, which was observed in
various cell types, including primary CD4+ T cells. Strikingly, we observed that DDX42 was able
to inhibit viruses from other families, which possess different replication strategies, including
SARS-CoV-2 and CHIKV. However, DDX42 did not have an impact on all the viruses we tested,
reminiscent of broad-spectrum antiviral inhibitors such as MxA, which show some specificity
(Haller et al., 2015). Further work is now warranted to explore in depth the breadth of DDX42
antiviral activity and determine whether it is specific of positive RNA viruses.
Interestingly, our PLA assays showed a close proximity between DDX42 and HIV-1 Capsid, which
is a viral protein recently shown to remain associated with reverse transcription complexes until
proviral DNA integration in the nucleus (Burdick et al., 2020; Dharan et al., 2020; Peng et al.,
2014). We also observed a close proximity between DDX42 and SARS-CoV-2 N or dsRNA.
Furthermore, LINE-1 RNAs were specifically pulled-down when DDX42 was immunoprecipitated.
Taken together, these observations strongly suggest a direct mode of action of DDX42 on viral
ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. DDX42 is known to be a non-processive helicase, which
also possesses RNA annealing activities and the ability to displace RNA-binding proteins from
single-stranded RNAs (Uhlmann-Schiffler et al., 2006). Moreover, DDX42 binds G-quadruplexes
(Zyner et al., 2019), which are secondary structures found in cellular and viral nucleic acids and
involved in various processes, such as transcription, translation and replication (Fay et al., 2017;
Ruggiero and Richter, 2018). All these known activities of DDX42 would be consistent with a

potential role in RNP remodeling (Uhlmann-Schiffler et al., 2006; Will et al., 2002). Nonetheless,
further investigation will be needed to determine whether DDX42 acts directly by altering viral
RNPs, and, if that’s the case, what are the determinants for viral RNP recognition.
In conclusion, this work highlights the importance of understanding the mechanism of action of
DDX42 RNA helicase and its contribution to the control of RNA virus replication, an understanding
which may contribute to the development of future antiviral interventional strategies.

Methods

Plasmids. The pLentiCas9-Blast, pLentiGuide-Puro vectors and the GeCKO sub-library A and B
plasmids were a gift from Prof. F. Zhang (Addgene #52962, #52963, and #1000000048,
respectively (Sanjana et al., 2014)). LVs coding for sgRNAs targeting the candidate genes and
control genes were obtained by cloning annealed oligonucleotides in BsmBI-digested
pLentiGuide-Puro, as described (Addgene). Control sgRNAs and sgRNAs targeting the candidate
genes, MX2 and IFNAR1, were designed with the Optimized CRISPR Design tool (not available

pRRL.sin.cPPT.CMV/HygromycinR.WPRE

and

pRRL.sin.cPPT.CMV/ZeocinR.WPRE), neomycin, hygromycin and zeocin resistance genes (i.e.
the genes coding for Neomycin phosphotransferase II, Hygromycin B phosphotransferase, and
Sh ble) were amplified by PCR from pcDNA3.1 (ThermoFisher Scientific), pAHM (Goujon et al.,
2013a), and pcDNA3.1/Zeo (ThermoFisher Scientific), respectively, and cloned by replacement
of GFP in pRRL.sin.cPPT.CMV/GFP.WPRE (Goujon et al., 2008) using BamHI and SalI
restriction sites. The pRRL.sin.cPPT.SFFV/E2-crimson-IRES-PuromycinR.WPRE has been

modified version of pCAGGS (Moncorge et al., 2013) to obtain pCAGGS/flag-DDX42.WPRE and
pCAGGS/flag-Firefly.WPRE. The NL4-3/Nef–internal ribosome entry signal (IRES)-Renilla (NL43/Nef-IRES-Renilla) and the CCR5-version of this proviral clone were gifts from Prof. Sumit
Chanda (Goujon et al., 2013b). Wild-type and Ba-L Env bearing HIV-1 NL4-3, IIIB and HIV-2
proviral clones have been described (Adachi et al., 1986; Simon et al., 1995; Schaller et al., 2011),
as well as the transmitted founder HIV-1 molecular clones CH077.t, CH106.c, REJO.c (gifts from
Prof. B. Hahn, (Ochsenbauer et al., 2012)) and HIV-2ROD10 and SIVMAC239 (Ryan-Graham and
Peden, 1995; Gaddis et al., 2004). GFP-coding HIV-1 based LV system (i.e. p8.91 HIV-1 GagPol, pMD.G, and GFP-coding minigenome), and HIV-2, FIV, and EIAV-derived, GFP coding LVs,
as well as MLV-derived, GFP coding retroviral vectors have all been described (Naldini et al.,
1996; Bainbridge et al., 2001), (O’Rourke et al., 2002; Saenz et al., 2005). The LINE-1 plasmid
99 RPS-GFP PUR (pRPS-GFP), 99 RPS-GFP JM111 PUR (pJM111) and pLRE3-GFP were
developed by Prof. Kazazian’s lab (Moran et al., 1996; Ostertag et al., 2000; Goodier et al., 2012).

Cell lines. Human cell lines HEK293T, U87-MG, TZM-bl were obtained from the ATCC and the
AIDS reagent program, respectively. T98G cells were a gift from Prof. G. Kochs (Freiburg
University, Germany), A549 and MDCK cells were a gift from Prof. W. Barclay (Imperial College
London, UK), Vero E6 cells were a gift from Christine Chable (CEMIPAI, CNRS). These cell lines
were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 1 % penicillin-streptomycin (Thermofisher). T98G/Cas9 and U87-MG/Cas9 were
obtained by transduction of T98G and U87-MG, respectively, with HIV-1-based LVs expressing
the spCas9-P2A-Blasticidin cassette (pLentiCas9-Blast (Sanjana et al., 2014)). U87MG/CD4/CXCR4 have been described (Goujon et al., 2013a) and were further modified to
express Cas9 and Firefly using pLentiCas9-Blast and pRRL.sin.cPPT.SFFV/Firefly.WPRE,
respectively. T98G/Cas9/CD4/CXCR4/Firefly were obtained by successive transductions of
T98G/Cas9 with pRRL.sin.cPPT.SFFV/CD4-IRES-CXCR4.WPRE at a high MOI, and
pRRL.sin.cPPT.SFFV/Firefly.WPRE, at a low MOI, respectively. Cell surface staining with antiCD4 and CXCR4 antibodies (Miltenyi Biotec) confirmed than more than 95% cells were positive
for both markers. A549 cells stably expressing ACE2 were generated by transduction with
RRL.sin.cPPT.SFFV.ACE2.WPRE containing-vector.
For antibiotic selection, cells were treated with 10 µg/mL Blasticidin (InvivoGen), 1 mg/mL Zeocin
(InvivoGen), 2 µg/mL Puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich), 250 µg/mL Hygromycin (Sigma-Aldrich), 1
mg/mL G418 (Sigma-Aldrich). When indicated, IFN (universal type 1 IFN, PBL Interferon Source)
was added at 1000 U/mL for 16-24h prior to virus infection or RNA extraction, and AZT and 3TC
(AIDS reagent program) at 10 µM for 2 h prior to infection.

Primary cells. Blood from healthy donors was obtained from the Etablissement Français du
Sang, under agreement n°21PLER2019-0106. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
were isolated by centrifugation through a Ficoll® Paque Plus cushion (Sigma-Aldrich). Primary
human CD4+ T cells and monocytes were purified by positive selection using CD3 and CD14

MicroBeads, respectively (Miltenyi Biotec), as previously described (Goujon et al., 2013a).
Monocytes were incubated for 3 hours in serum-free Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640
medium and further differentiated into macrophages by culture for 5-7 days in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 100 ng/ml granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; Miltenyi). CD4+ T cells were in cultures in RPMI
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin and stimulated 48h
with 10 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA) (Fisher Scientific) and 50 U/mL interleukin-2 (IL-2,
Miltney Biotec) prior to electroporation.

Genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screens. The plasmids coding GeCKO sub-libraries A and B were
amplified and prepared according to the provided guidelines (Lentiviral Crispr Toolbox, Addgene).
60 million T98G/Cas9 cells were transduced with GeCKO LVs at a MOI of 0,1 to cover about 100times the half-library complexity. After 48h, the cells were selected with puromycin, amplified for
12-15 days. 45 million cells were harvested and frozen down at -80°C for subsequent genomic
DNA extraction, using the QIAamp DNA Blood Maxi Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions
(Qiagen). In parallel, 60 million cells from the initial GeCKO populations were used for the screen.
The cells were treated with 1000 U/mL IFN for 24h, infected with LVs coding a hygromycin
resistance cassette. 48h later the cells selected with hygromycin and the surviving cells amplified.
Two other rounds of IFN treatment, LV infection and antibiotic selection were subsequently
performed with LVs coding a neomycin resistance cassette and a zeocin resistance cassette,
respectively. The three time-selected populations were amplified and 45 million cells were
harvested and stored at -80°C for subsequent genomic DNA extraction, as previously. After
genomic DNA extraction, the sgRNA coding sequences integrated in the genomic DNA from the
initial and 3-times selected populations were amplified by touch-down PCR and sequenced by
Illumina deep sequencing. To this aim, 120 µg of genomic DNA was amplified using DNA
Herculase II Fusion DNA polymerase (Agilent) in the presence of 2% DMSO, 1 mM of dNTPs;

C-3’). Briefly, after 5 minutes at 95°C, 14 cycles of pre-amplification were performed with a
hybridization temperature decreasing by 0.5°C per cycle (30 sec at 95°C, 30 sec at 60°C, 30 sec
at 72°C), followed by 30 cycles of amplification (30 sec at 95°C, 30 sec at 53°C, 30 sec at 72°C).
50 ng of each amplicon was dual indexed in a 5-cycle PCR reaction using the PCR module and
indexed primers from the Nextera kit (Illumina). Resulting libraries were purified on AMPure XP
magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter) using a 0,8X ratio and verified on Fragment Analyzer using
the HS NGS fragment kit (Agilent). Libraries were quantified using microfluorimetry (QuBit,
Invitrogen), mixed with a PhiX library (Illumina) and sequenced on one single read 50nt lane of
Hiseq2500 using the rapid mode.
Image analyses and base calling were performed using the Illumina HiSeq Control Software and
Real-Time Analysis component (v1.18.66.3). Demultiplexing was performed using Illumina's
conversion software (bcl2fastq 2.20). The quality of the raw data was assessed using FastQC
(v0.11.5) from the Babraham Institute and the Illumina software SAV (Sequencing Analysis
Viewer). Potential contaminants were investigated with the FastQ Screen (Wingett and Andrews,
2018) (v0.11.4) software from the Babraham Institute.
Sequencing reads were trimmed using Cutadapt (Martin, 2011) (v1.13), with options -g [primer
sequence] -u [length of remaining 3' bases] -e 0.2 -m 18 -l 20, to remove primer sequences and
retrieve the 20 bases long sequences corresponding to sgRNAs. These retrieved sequences were
then aligned to the GecKOv2 Human Library (A or B) reference sequences (keeping only nonduplicated sgRNA sequences, the duplicated ones being annotated) using Bowtie (Langmead et
al., 2009) (v1.2), with options -v 2 -norc -S. Resulting bam files were sorted and indexed using
Samtools (Li et al., 2009) (v1.5). Quantification of sgRNAs was done using Samtools idxstats.
MAGeCK (Li et al., 2014) (v0.5.7) was used to normalize (total count method) and identify

transduced cells (mageck test command).

Lentiviral and retroviral production. To produce lentiviral vector particles, HEK293T cells were
transfected by polyethylenimine (PEI) co-transfection with miniviral, HIV-1 based genome coding
plasmids (e.g. LentiCas9-Blast, LentiGuide-Puro or pRRL-SFFV), p8.91 (HIV-1 GagPol) and
pMD.G (VSV-G) at a ratio of 1:1:0.5, respectively. The medium was replaced after 6h and viral
particles were harvested 42h later, filtered, and directly used to transduce target cells (or stored
at -80°C). After 4 to 6 hours, the transduction medium was replaced with complete DMEM, and
the cells were treated 48h later with the relevant antibiotics. The HIV-2-, FIV-, EIAV-GFP coding
LVs were produced using GFP-coding HIV-2-, FIV-, EIAV-based miniviral genomes, together with
HIV-2-, FIV-, EIAV- GagPol, expression constructs and pMD.G at a ratio of 1:1:0.5. MIGR1 MLVderived retroviral vectors were obtained with B-MLV Gag-Pol-expressing plasmid pCIG3B, the
GFP-expressing minigenome pMIGR1 and pMD.G. at a ratio of 1:1:0.5, respectively and
harvested as previously described.
HIV-1 Renilla and NL4-3 HIV-1 were produced by standard PEI transfection of HEK293T. When
indicated, pMD.G was cotransfected with the provirus at a 3:1 ratio. The culture medium was
changed 6h later, and virus-containing supernatants were harvested 42h later. Viral particles were
filtered, purified by ultracentrifugation through a sucrose cushion (25% weight/volume in TrisNaCl-EDTA buffer) for 75 min at 4°C and 28,000 rpm using a SW 32 TI rotor (Beckman Coulter),
resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 or DMEM medium and stored in small aliquots at -80°C.
Viral particles were titrated using an HIV-1 p24Gag Alpha-Lisa kit and an Envision plate reader
(Perkin Elmer) and/or by determining their infection titers on target cells.

Lentiviral and retroviral infections. For infections with replication-competent HIV-1 Renilla or
wild-type and/or VSV-G pseudotyped-HIV-1, target cells were plated at 2.5 x 104 cells per well in
96-well plates or at 2 x 105 cells per well in 12-well plates and infected for 24-48 h before lysis

Promega) or fixation with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA)-PBS, permeabilization (Perm/Wash buffer,
BDBiosciences) and intracellular staining with the anti-p24Gag KC57-FITC antibody (Beckman
Coulter), as described previously (Goujon and Malim, 2010). For TZM-bl assays, the bgalactosidase activity was measured using the Galacto-Star™ system (ThermoFisher Scientific).
For infections with lentiviral and retroviral vectors, target cells were plated at 2.5 x 104 cells per
well in 96-well plates the day prior to infection with vectors at the indicated MOIs, and the
percentages of infected cells were scored by flow cytometry 24h later. For primary CD4+ T cell
infections, 105 cells were infected with 100 ng p24Gag of HIV-1 Renilla for 24 h prior to lysis and
luciferase activity measure. For MDM infections, 8 x 104 cells were infected with 100 ng p24Gag of
a CCR5-tropic version of HIV-1 Renilla for 30 h prior to lysis and luciferase activity measure.

Retrotransposon assays. For GFP-based retrotransposon assays, HEK293T cells (2 x 105 cells)
were co-transfected with either 1 μg of pJM111 (a negative control with two point mutations in
ORF1 that abolish retrotransposition), pRPS-GFP or pLRE3-GFP with either 1 μg of pCAGGSFlag-Firefly or pCAGGS-Flag-DDX42. At 7 days post-transfection, the percentage of GFPexpressing cells was scored by flow cytometry.

CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out
For CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out in cell lines, Lentiguide-Puro LVs coding sgRNAs targeting the
indicated genes or non-targeting sgRNAs were produced, and U87-MG Cas9/CD4/CXCR4/Firefly
were transduced for 6 h before replacing the supernatants with fresh, complete medium. The
transduced cells were selected with puromycin two days later and amplified for 12-15 day. For
CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out in activated primary CD4+ T cells, 2 million cells per condition were
washed with PBS1X, and electroporated using the 4d-Nucleofector® (Lonza) and the Amaxa P3
primary cell kit with 183 pmol of crispr/tracr RNA duplex (Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 crRNA XT and
tracrRNA XT, IDT®) and 61 pmol of Cas9 (Alt-R® S.p. Cas9 Nuclease V3, IDT®). After
electroporation, the cells were incubated for 4 days at 37°C in X-VIVO15 medium (Lonza)
supplemented with 1% pen/strep and IL-2 at 500 U/ml prior to cell counting and infection. The

crRNA sequences of the sgDDX42-1, -2, and -3 were identical to the ones cloned in pLentiguidePuro, and the crRNA of the sgDDX42-4 and sgDDX42-5 were pre-designed by IDT®, as follow:
sg4-DDX42 5’-CGGAGATCTATTAACTGCTG-3’, sg5-DDX42 5’-GAGTTGGTGAGTTTTCAGC3’.

siRNA transfection. DDX42 and control knockdowns were achieved by transfecting the indicated
siRNAs at 44nM, 14.2nM, and 100nM final in U87-MG cells, TZM-bl cells and MDMs, respectively,
with lipofectamine RNAimax (Thermofisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The scramble siRNA controls used were universal siCTRL1 (SIC001) and siCTRL2
(SIC002) (Sigma-Aldrich) and the sequences of the siRNAs targeting DDX42 were siDDX42-1:
5’-CAGAAUGCCUGGUUUCGGA-3’ (SASI_Hs01_00119846, Sigma-Aldrich®), siDDX42-2: 5’CUUACCUUGUGUUUGAUGA-3’ (SASI_Hs01_00119845, Sigma-Aldirch®), siDDX42-4: 5’AUCUCGAAUACCCUUUACG-3’ (ID :136410, Ambion®).

RNA immunoprecipitation. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with equal amounts of pRPSGFP and pCAGGS-Flag-DDX42 or -Flag-Firefly. 4 days post-transfection, cells are washed twice
in PBS1X, incubated 10 min with 0,1% formaldehyde in PBS1X and 5 min in 250 mM Glycine and
washed twice in cold PBS1X. Cells are lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM
NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, protease inhibitor cocktail and 40
U/mL RNasin). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000g, for 10 min at 4 °C.
Fractions of cell lysates were harvested at this stage to serve as controls for protein and RNA
inputs (15%) and the rest was incubated with Flag-magnetic beads (Life Technologies) for 2 h, at
4 °C. The beads were washed 5 times and the immunoprecipitated proteins eluted using 150
μg/mL 3x Flag peptide (Sigma–Aldrich) in elution buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 75 mM NaCl,
1mM DTT, protease inhibitor cocktail and 40 U/mL RNasin) for 2 h. Fractions of eluates were
harvested for immunoblot analysis (1/6th) and the rest subjected to RNA extraction (5/6th). RNA
extractions were performed using TRIzol (ThermoFisher Scientific).

RNA quantification. 0,5-2 x 106 cells were collected 2-3 days after siRNA transfection or 24h
after IFN treatment or no treatment, and total RNAs were isolated using the RNeasy kit with oncolumn DNase treatment (Qiagen). cDNAs were generated using 250 ng RNA (High-Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit, Applied Biosystem, ThermoFisher Scientific, catalogue number
4368814) and analysed by quantitative (q)PCR using TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied
Biosystem) specific for ACTB (Hs99999903_m1), GAPDH (Hs99999905_m1), and DDX42
(Hs00201296_m1). Triplicate reactions were run according to the manufacturer’s instructions
using a ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR system. For relative quantification, samples were normalized to
both ACTB and GAPDH mRNA expression and the DDCt analysis.
For the measure of LINE-1 RNAs, 100 ng RNA (or 25 µl of RNA extracted from the IP eluates,
i.e. ~60% of the total amount of immunoprecipitated RNA) were reverse transcribed and analysed

quantification was performed using a pRPS-GFP standard curve.
For the measure of SARS-CoV-2 replication, 3 x 105 cells were harvested and total RNA was
extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) employing on-column DNase treatment. 125 ng of
cellular RNAs were used to generate cDNAs that were analysed by qPCR using RdRp primers

linear, one-way amplification by performing the pre-amplification PCR with the U3-reverse primer
alone. Then a qPCR was performed on pre-amplification products using U3-forward primer 5’TCTACCACACACAAGGCTAC-3’ and U3-reverse primer with the U3 probe 5’-[FAM]CAGAACTACACACCAGGGCCAGGGGTCA-[TAMRA]-3’. qPCR reactions were performed in

copy numbers and confirm the linearity of all assays.

Proximity Ligation assay. The proximity ligation assays were performed using the Duolink® in
situ Detection Reagents (Sigma-Aldrich, DUO92014). For PLA with HIV-1, MDMs were plated in
24-well plates with coverslips pre-treated with poly-L-lysin (Sigma-Aldrich) and infected with 1 µg
p24Gag of HIV-1 NL4-3 (Ba-L Env) or mock-infected. For PLA with SARS-CoV-2, A549-ACE2 cells
were plated in 24-well plates with coverslips and infected at an MOI of 0,1. 24 h later, the cells
were fixed with 2-4% paraformaldehyde in PBS1X for 10 min, washed in PBS1X and
permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After a couple of washes in PBS1X, either NGB
buffer (50 mM NH4Cl, 2% goat serum and 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS) or Duolink® blocking
solution was added for 1h. Cells were incubated with mouse AG3.0 anti-HIV-1 Capsid antibody
(National Institutes of Health (NIH) AIDS Reagent Program #4121), or J2 anti-dsRNA antibody
(SCICONS), or anti-SARS-CoV-2 Nucleoprotein (N; BioVision), and rabbit anti-DDX42 antibody
(HPA023571, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in NGB buffer or in Duolink® blocking solution for 1h. After
2 washes in PBS1X, the cells were incubated with the DUOLINK® in situ PLA® Probe Anti-rabbit
minus (DUO92006) and DUOLINK® in situ PLA® Probe Anti-mouse plus (DUO92001) for 1h at
37°C. After 2 washes in PBS1X, the ligation mix was added for 30 min at 37°C. After 2 washes in
PBS1X, the cells were incubated with the amplification mix for 100 min at 37°C followed by 3
washes in PBS1X. In the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, an additional staining was performed by
incubating cells in an anti-mouse Alexa Fluor secondary antibody. Finally, the cells were washed
twice with PBS1X and stained with Hoechst at 1 µg/mL for 5 min, washed again and the coverslips
mounted on slides in Prolong mounting media (ThermoFisher Scientific). Z-stack images were
acquired using an LSM 880 confocal microscope (ZEISS) using a 63x lens. PLA punctae
quantification was performed using the FIJI software (Schindelin et al., 2012). Briefly, maximum
z-projections were performed on each z-stack and the number of nuclei per field were quantified.
Then, by using a median filter and thresholding, PLA punctae were isolated and quantified
automatically using the Analyse Particles function. To obtain a mean number of dots per cell, the

number of PLA dots per field were averaged by the number of nuclei. In the case of SARS-CoV2 infection, the infected cells were identified using N or dsRNA immunofluorescence staining. For
representative images, single cells were imaged using a LSM880 confocal microscope coupled
with an Airyscan module. Processing of the raw Airyscan images was performed on the ZEN
Black software.

Immunoblot analysis. Cell pellets were lysed in sample buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5.2%
SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol), resolved by SDS–PAGE
and analysed by immunoblotting using primary antibodies specific for human DDX42

IAV production and infection
We have described previously IAV NanoLuciferase reporter virus generation (Doyle et al., 2018).
Stocks were titrated by plaque assays on MDCK cells. IAV challenges were performed in serumfree DMEM for 1 h and the medium was subsequently replaced with DMEM containing 10%. IAV
infection experiments were performed in triplicates in 96-well plates with cultures maintained for
16 h post-challenge. NanoLuciferase activity was measured with the Nano-Glo assay system
(Promega), and luminescence was detected using a plate reader (Infinite® 200 PRO, Tecan).

VSV production and infection. A VSV-G pseudotyped-VSV-Denv reporter virus, coding both
GFP and Firefly Luciferase, was obtained from Gert Zimmer (Rentsch and Zimmer, 2011). The
virus was amplified on pMD.G transfected 293T and titrated thanks to the GFP reporter gene. For
infection, 2.5 x 104 cells per well in 96-well plates were infected at the indicated MOIs. 24h after
infection, cells were lysed and Firefly luciferase activity was measured (Firefly luciferase Assay
System Promega).

ZIKV production and infection. The nanoluciferase expressing ZIKV construct has been
described (Mutso et al., 2017). The corresponding linearized plasmid was transcribed in vitro
using the SP6 mMESSAGE mMACHINE™ (Thermofischer Scientific) and HEK293T cells were
transfected with the transcribed RNA. After 7 days, supernatants were harvested, filtered and
stock titers were determined by plaque assays on Vero cells. For infections, 2.5 x 104 cells per
well in 96-well plates were infected, at the indicated MOIs. 24h after infection, cells were lysed
and Nanoluciferase activity was measured using the Kit Nano Glo luciferase Assay (Promega).

CHIKV production and infection. The Nanoluciferase luciferase coding CHIKV construct was a
gift from Andres Merits. The linearized plasmid coding CHIKV genome was transcribed with the
T7 mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Thermofischer Scientific) and 5 x 105 HEK293T were
transfected with 1-4 µg of transcribed RNA, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermofischer Scientific).
After 24h, supernatants were harvested, filtered and viruses were then amplified on baby hamster
kidney (BHK21) cells. Stock titers were determined by plaque assays on Vero cells. For infections,
2.5 x 104 cells per well in 96-well plates were infected at the indicated MOIs. 24h after infection,
cells were lysed and Nanoluciferase activity was measured.

SARS-CoV-2 production and infection
The SARS-CoV-2 BetaCoV/France/IDF0372/2020 isolate was supplied by Pr. Sylvie van der Werf
and the National Reference Centre for Respiratory Viruses hosted by Institut Pasteur (Paris,
France). The virus was amplified in Vero E6 cells (MOI 0,005) in serum-free media supplemented
with 0,1 µg/ml L-1-p-Tosylamino-2-phenylethyl chloromethylketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin
(Sigma-Aldrich). The supernatant was harvested at 72 h post infection when cytopathic effects
were observed (with around 50% cell death), cell debris were removed by centrifugation, and
aliquots stored at -80C. Viral supernatants were titrated by plaque assays in Vero E6 cells. Typical
titers were 5.106 plaque forming units (PFU)/ml.
Infections of A549-ACE2 cells were performed at the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI; as

A. IFN pre-treatment potently inhibits HIV-1 infection in T98G cells and is, at least partially, saturable.
T98G/Cas9/CD4/CXCR4/ Firefly cells were pre-treated with IFN for 24 h prior to infection with increasing doses
of NL4-3 Renilla (indicated in ng p24Gag). Renilla activity was normalized to Firefly activity and the relative
infection efficiencies are shown. Data represent the average of 3 independent experiments and one standard
deviation from the mean.
B. GeCKO screen validation. GeCKO control cells and enriched cells from 3 successive rounds of selection
(Round 1, 2, and 3, as indicated) were treated with IFN or not and infected with GFP-expressing lentiviral vectors.
The percentage of infected cells was evaluated by flow cytometry 2 days post-infection. Data represent the
average of 2 independent experiments and one standard deviation from the mean.

Figure S2. Related to Figure 2.
A. DDX42 is not an ISG. The indicated primary cells or immortalized cell cultures were treated with IFN for 24 h
or left untreated. RNA was subsequently extracted and DDX42 and ISG15 (a prototype ISG) mRNA levels were
quantified by RT-qPCR; Actin B and GAPDH were used as endogenous controls. The bar chart shows the relative
levels of expression of DDX42 and ISG15 in the presence or absence of IFN treatment. Data represent the mean
± S.E.M of three independent experiments.
B. DDX42 silencing efficiency in monocyte-derived macrophages. siRNA-transfected MDMs were harvested
48h post-transfection for RNA extraction and quantification of DDX42 mRNA levels by RT-qPCR. Actin and
GAPDH were used as endogenous controls. Data represent the mean ± S.E.M of three independent experiments
performed with cells from 3 different blood donors (parallel samples from Figure 2E).
C. Ectopic expression of DDX42 K303E mutant increases HIV-1 infection. U87-MG/CD4/CXCR4 cells were
transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing either Firefly (negative control), WT DDX42 (DDX42) or a motif I
mutant DDX42 K303, which has an impaired ATPase activity (DDX42 K303E). Transduced cells were infected
with NL4-3 Renilla and the infection efficiency was assessed 24h later by measuring Renilla activity. Data
represent the mean ± S.E.M of four independent experiments.

A. DDX42 depletion does not affect HIV-1 entry. DDX42-depleted U87-MG/CD4/CXCR4 cells were infected
with the indicated amounts of viruses carrying the β-lactamase (BlaM)-Vpr fusion protein for 3 hours. The cells
were subsequently loaded with CCF2-AM substrate dye for 2h, washed extensively and incubated for another
16h for the reaction to develop. Cells positive for the CCF2-AM product were scored by flow cytometry. Data
represent the mean ± S.E.M of three independent experiments.
B. Effect of DDX42 on lentiviral vectors. U87-MG/CD4/CXCR4 cells were transfected with non-targeting siRNA
(siCTRL) or siRNAs targeting DDX42 (siDDX42-1, -2, and -4) and, 72 h later, the cells infected with HIV-1- HIV2- FIV- EIAV-based, GFP-coding LVs at a MOI of 0,1. Infection efficiency was scored 24 h by measuring the
percentage of GFP expressing cells by flow cytometry. Data represent the mean ± S.E.M of three independent
experiments.
C. DDX42 localization in MDMs. MDMs were fixed, endogenous DDX42 and the nuclei were visualized using
DDX42-specific antibodies and Hoechst staining, respectively, and confocal microscopy. Representative images
are shown. Scale bar, 10 µm.

Supplemental methods
Only the methods specific for the supplemental figures are presented here.
Plasmids.
pBlaM-Vpr and pAdVAntage have been described (Cavrois et al., 2002).
Lentiviral production.
β-lactamase-Vpr (BlaM-Vpr)-carrying viruses, bearing the wild-type Env, were produced by cotransfection of HEK293T cells with the NL4-3/Nef-IRES-Renilla provirus expression vector,
pBlaM-Vpr and pAdVAntage at a ratio of 4:1:0.5, as previously described (Cavrois et al., 2002).
Viral particles were titrated using an HIV-1 p24Gag Alpha-Lisa kit and an Envision plate reader
(Perkin Elmer).

Quantification of mRNA expression.
TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystem) specific for ISG15: Hs00192713_m1.

BlaM-Vpr assay for HIV-1 entry. These assays were performed as described previously (Goujon
and Malim, 2010). Briefly, 2 x 105 U87-MG/CD4/CXCR4 cells were plated in 24-well plates and
incubated with BlaM-Vpr carrying NL4-3 particles (31, 62, 125 ng p24Gag) or mock-infected for 3
h at 37°C. The cells were then washed once in CO2-independent medium and loaded with CCF2AM substrate-containing solution (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 1 h at room temperature before 2
washes and incubation at room temperature for 16 h in development medium (CO2-independent
medium containing 2,5 mM probenecid). Finally, the cells were trypsinized, washed and fixed in
1% paraformaldehyde (PFA)-PBS1X before analysis with a FACSCanto™ II (Becton Dickinson).
