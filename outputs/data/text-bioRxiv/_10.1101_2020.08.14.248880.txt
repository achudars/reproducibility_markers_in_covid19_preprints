ABSTRACT

29

Entry of SARS-CoV-2 is facilitated by endogenous and exogenous proteases. These

30

proteases proteolytically activate the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and are key

31

modulators of virus tropism. We show that SARS-CoV-2 naïve serum exhibits significant

32

inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 entry. We identify alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) as the major

33

serum protease inhibitor that potently restrict protease-mediated entry of SARS-CoV-2.

34

AAT inhibition of protease-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry in vitro occurs at concentrations

35

far below what is present in serum and bronchoalveolar tissues, suggesting that AAT

36

effects are physiologically relevant. Moreover, AAT deficiency affects up to 20% of the

37

population and its symptomatic manifestations coincides with many risk factors

38

associated with severe COVID-19 disease. In addition to the effects that AAT may have

39

on viral entry itself, we argue that the anti-inflammatory and coagulation regulatory

40

activity of AAT have implications for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)

41

pathogenicity, SARS-CoV-2 tissue restriction, convalescent plasma therapies, and even

42

potentially AAT therapy.

47

The COVID-19 pandemic that began in December 2019 has resulted in tens of millions

48

of cases with hundreds of thousands of deaths. The central conundrum of this

49

pandemic is the heterogeneity of disease severity in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals.

50

The widespread disparities in outcomes has spurred global efforts to better understand

51

SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, investigate the factors contributing to the clinical course of

52

COVID-19, and develop viable therapeutics. One of the most promising therapeutic

53

targets is the Spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, which bears the fusion machinery

54

necessary to mediate viral entry. Vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and convalescent

55

plasma therapy are all premised upon neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 spike (CoV2-S)

56

mediated entry. All three modalities are being developed at unprecedented speed.

57

Unfortunately, the lack of standardized virus neutralization assays (VNAs) or reporting

58

metrics have made it difficult to compare the efficacy across the proliferating number of

59

vaccine platforms and CoV2-S targeted treatment modalities.

60
61

Standardizing a SARS-CoV-2 Viral Neutralization Assay

62

In an accompanying study, we worked to develop a scalable, standardized VNA that

63

reflects the complex interplay between CoV2-S receptor interaction and proteolytic

64

activation. To that end we generated and validated VSV∆G pseudotyped particles

65

bearing SARS-CoV-2 spike (CoV2pp).1 We initially optimized infection conditions in

66

serum free media. Due to the role of proteolytic activation in SARS-CoV-2 entry, we

67

utilized exogenous trypsin as well as soybean trypsin inhibitor to maximize entry of the

68

CoV2pp while limiting cytotoxicity. These conditions were designed noting that

69

proteolytic activation of CoV2-S is required for the receptor-induced conformational

70

changes that result in virus-cell membrane fusion and viral entry. Several endosomal,

71

cell surface, and exogenous proteases, including furin, select cathepsins and

72

TMPRSSs, and trypsin-like proteases have been implicated in mediating these

73

cleavage events for SARS-CoV-2 and enhancing cellular entry (Fig. 1A).2–4 A similar

74

body of evidence also indicates that these proteases and others, such as elastase, play

75

critical roles in the productive processing of the S protein from SARS-CoV-1, MERS-

76

CoV, and other betacoronaviruses.5–7 In the case of MERS-CoV, proteolytic processing

77

of spike is capable of dictating cell tropism and correlates well with virulence.8 For

78

SARS-CoV-2, the role of cell surface protease-mediated entry is of sufficient importance

79

that TMPRSS2 overexpression can render some cell lines refractory to chloroquine

80

mediated inhibition of virus entry.9

81
82

To standardize our VNA, we initially utilized trypsin-treated CoV2pp for human serum

83

neutralization experiments. However, we observed that under these conditions, sera

84

from patients not exposed to SARS-CoV-2 was capable of neutralizing these

85

pseudoviruses, though, as expected, to a lesser extent than sera from patients that

86

tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (Fig. 1B)1.

Uncovering AAT: a heat-labile, CoV2pp neutralizing factor in SARS-CoV-2 naïve

serum

90

To pre-empt the variable neutralizing effect of seronegative serum, we diluted our

91

trypsin-treated CoV2pp in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). However,

92

while this provided an easy solution in standardizing our assay for “out-of-the-box” use

93

when sent to multiple labs, it left the question of “why” unanswered. This neutralizing

94

effect of SARS-CoV-2 naïve human sera was ameliorated through heat-inactivation by

95

incubation at 56ºC for 1hr (Fig. 1B), and also appeared to be specific to CoV2-S

96

mediated entry as VSV-G pseudotyped particles (VSV-Gpp) were unaffected. Thus, the

97

serum neutralizing factor(s) was unlikely to be cross-reactive antibodies to seasonal

98

coronaviruses or complement per se. We therefore suspected a heat-labile serum

99

factor(s) capable of inhibiting trypsin.10

100
101

To validate these observations, we tested a panel of non-heat-inactivated human sera

102

for neutralization activity against CoV2pp and VSV-Gpp. SARS-CoV-2 seropositive and

103

seronegative sera were diluted in SFM (Supplemental Fig. 1A). Here, we observed

104

neutralization of trypsin-treated CoV2pp by both seronegative and seropositive sera

105

(Fig. 2A and Supplemental Fig. 1B). Importantly, VSV-Gpp was not inhibited by the

106

samples tested (Fig. 2B and Supplemental Fig. 1C), once again showing that this effect

107

was CoV2pp-specific. At the same time, an external group at Louisiana State University

108

Health Shreveport (LSUHS) independently observed neutralization by seronegative

109

sera under similar experimental conditions using our CoV2pp (Fig. 2C, Supplemental

110

Fig. 1D and 1E). Remarkably, in both groups, SARS-CoV-2 naïve sera inhibited

111

CoV2pp entry by 90-97% (Fig. 2A and 2C, left panels). Nonetheless, seropositive

112

patient sera showed inhibition orders of magnitude beyond this threshold, suggesting

113

antibody mediated inhibition of CoV2pp entry (Fig. 2A and C, right panels). Additionally,

114

using the identical serum samples in Fig. 2C, collaborators at the University of Texas

115

Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) observed modest, but significant, neutralization of

116

live virus by seronegative sera as assayed by a plaque reduction neutralization assay

117

(Fig. 2D and Supplemental Fig. 1F).

118
119

Upon making these repeated observations, we searched the literature for highly

120

abundant and heat labile products in serum and identified alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) and

121

alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) as potential candidates.10 These blood products are

122

typically present in human serum at high concentrations (1.1-2.2 mg/mL for AAT and 2-

123

4 mg/mL for A2M) and have been described to inhibit both exogenous and endogenous

124

proteases.11–13 Despite the careful characterizations of the role endogenous and

125

exogenous proteases play in SARS-CoV-2 entry, there have been limited

126

characterizations of the role in vivo protease inhibitors play in modulating SARS-CoV-2

127

entry. A2M and AAT alone are responsible for approximately 10% and 90% of serum

128

antiprotease capacity, respectively.14

129
130

A2M functions to inhibit a broad range of proteases, such as serine and cysteine

131

proteases. In addition to protease inhibitory functions, A2M also inhibits thrombin to

132

prevent coagulation and binds to growth factors and cytokines. No clinical conditions

133

have yet been associated with low plasma levels of A2M.11 On the other hand, AAT is a

134

protease inhibitor that irreversibly binds serine proteases and plays additional roles in

135

the regulation of inflammation and coagulation.15 Notably, decreased plasma

136

concentrations of or function of AAT have been associated with liver and lung disease,

137

particularly pulmonary emphysema due to unregulated neutrophil elastase activity.12

138

Mutations leading to these conditions are highly prevalent as nearly 20% of individuals

139

have non-wildtype AAT alleles.13

140
141

To assess whether AAT and/or A2M alone could inhibit trypsin-treated CoV2pp entry,

142

we added each at the time of infection and observed potent entry inhibition by AAT and

143

modest inhibition by A2M, with IC50s of 14.47µg/mL and 54.20µg/mL, respectively (Fig.

144

3A, left panel). Importantly, neither protein inhibited VSV-Gpp (Fig. 3A, right panel).

145

Albumin, the most abundant protein in blood, showed no significant reduction of entry of

146

either CoV2pp or VSV-Gpp (Fig. 3A), which underscores that the inhibitory effects of

147

AAT and A2M on CoV2-S mediated entry was specific.

148
149

While these findings suggest that AAT, and to a lesser extent A2M, can inhibit

150

exogenous trypsin-like proteases known to enhance SARS-CoV-2 entry, tissue

151

restriction of SARS-CoV-2 infection is also mediated by proteases at the cell surface.2,3

152

Therefore, we sought to investigate whether either protein could inhibit TMPRSS2, an

153

endogenous serine protease implicated in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. We previously

154

engineered two ultra-permissive 293T clones stably expressing ACE2 (clone 5-7) or

155

ACE2+TMPRSS2 (clone F8-2). Each of these lines was capable of highly efficient

156

CoV2pp entry in the absence of trypsin pre-treatment. To assess entry inhibition by AAT

157

and A2M, we performed VNAs in both clones using CoV2pp without any trypsin pre-

158

treatment but diluted in standard media (DMEM+10% FBS). Here, we observed that

159

AAT inhibited CoV2pp entry into TMPRSS2 expressing F8-2 clones, but not the 5-7

160

clones (Fig. 3B). For both cell lines, A2M and albumin both displayed no entry inhibition

161

at the concentrations tested. As additional controls, we observe potent inhibition of

162

CoV2pp by sRBD in both cell lines and, as expected, Nafamostat mesylate, a serine

163

protease inhibitor, inhibited entry in only the TMPRSS2-expressing F8-2 clones

164

(Supplemental Fig. 2). Notably, AAT and Nafamostat inhibition of CoV2pp entry into

165

TMPRSS2-expressing F8-2 cells approached a maximal inhibition of ~80%, suggesting

166

that SARS-CoV-2 can enter via other pathways noted in Fig. 1A.

167
168

Together, these observations show that not only can SARS-CoV-2 naïve sera potently

169

inhibit protease-mediated entry of SARS-CoV-2, but AAT and A2M appear to be

170

potential regulators of protease-mediated entry by SARS-CoV-2. In concert with the

171

large body of literature about AAT and the proteolytic processing of coronavirus spike

172

proteins, we are led to three distinct, but important hypotheses. The first is that AAT and

173

A2M may play a biologically relevant role in tissue restriction in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

174

The second is that, if the first hypothesis is true, variant AAT genotypes could influence

175

the relative severity of COVID-19. And thirdly, treatment with the already FDA-approved

176

AAT, could play a role in simultaneously controlling viral burden as well as aberrant

177

immune responses.

181

In an accompanying paper, we reported that a factor, or factors, in SARS-CoV-2

182

seronegative sera is capable of inhibiting trypsin-mediated entry of CoV2pp. Here, we

183

pinpoint AAT and A2M as highly abundant serum factors that inhibit the effect of

184

exogenous proteases on CoV2pp entry. Moreover, at the concentrations tested, we

185

show that AAT, but not A2M, can inhibit TMPRSS2-mediated entry of CoV2pp at sub-

186

physiologic concentrations. Two recent pre-peer review reports support these findings.

187

Azouz et al utilized a fluorescent cleavage assay in a screen that identified four small

188

molecules and AAT as inhibitors of TMPRSS2 enzymatic activity.16 Wettstein et al

189

report neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by polypeptides extracted from pooled

190

bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids and, after fractionation and mass spectrometry,

191

identify AAT as a component driving this activity.17 Although previously reported, the

192

identification of AAT in the BAL confirms that it can diffuse into lung tissues and

193

suggests that it can be present at the site of SAR-CoV-2 infection and replication. They

194

also show that while the fraction containing AAT inhibits >99% of infection, there is

195

another set of fractions that inhibit just under 90% of infection. We speculate that these

196

fractions may contain A2M which we show to be a less potent inhibitor of trypsin-

197

mediated CoV2pp entry, perhaps due to the requirement of a tetramer to trap two

198

proteases (Fig. 3A).11 Interestingly, this lack of potency may be offset by its broader

199

protease inhibition potential, particularly for cysteine proteases such as Cathepsin B

200

and L, which have been reported to play a role in endosomal mediated SARS-CoV-2

201

entry. Additionally, elastase—a serine protease released by neutrophils—has been

202

previously reported to play a role in enhancing SARS-CoV-1 and MERS entry.7

203

Although the role of elastase in SARS-CoV-2 entry has not been elucidated, elevation of

204

neutrophil counts in BAL and serum have been consistently associated with severe

205

COVID-19 cases.18–20 In spite of its name, AAT has a stronger binding affinity to

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.14.248880; this version posted August 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

206

elastase than trypsin, and this is borne out by the clinically significant sequalae

207

associated with AAT deficiency.15

208
209

Though the findings presented here focus on protease inhibitors’ ability to inhibit

210

protease-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry, the inhibitors play significant additional roles.

211

While others have speculated that neutrophil elastase should be considered as a target

212

for potential COVID-19 prophylactics, AAT was not noted specifically.21 AAT, as an

213

acute phase protein, has been characterized to play roles in modulating inflammation by

214

inhibiting elastase among other factors. Elastase is critical for the formation of neutrophil

215

extracellular traps (NETs) in acute pneumonia, which can amplify inflammatory

216

responses if not resolved by AAT. Runaway pulmonary inflammation and NETosis is an

217

emerging theme in COVID-19 pathogenesis.22 AAT is also known to modulate activities

218

that result in downstream IL-6 inhibition, which is heavily implicated in COVID-19

219

pathogenicity.12,23 Seeking to capitalize on these anti-inflammatory roles and the already

220

well established use of recombinant AAT to treat AAT deficiency, McElvaney et al

221

recently reported the initiation of a clinical trial for AAT treatment of COVID-19 based on

222

their published work.24 Moreover, AAT has regulatory roles in the coagulation cascade25

223

and, via elastase inhibition, could inhibit NET-triggered immunothromboses.26 Notably,

224

inflammatory dysregulation and coagulopathies have been reported to play a role in the

225

disparate COVID-19 severities between patients.27

226
227

The potent neutralization of protease-mediated cellular entry by SARS-CoV-2 along with

228

the wide range and prevalence of functionally different AAT genotypes implies a

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.14.248880; this version posted August 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

229

potential role for AAT in variable COVID-19 severity. Of particular note, nearly 20% of

230

individuals are either heterozygous or homozygous for non-wildtype alleles, many of

231

which have been described to result in reduced levels of AAT in the blood or reduced

232

AAT function.13 Although many mutations have been characterized, new mutations that

233

impair abundance or function are still being identified. For example, AAT variants such

234

as G373R or the R223C (F allele) have been identified and reported to have wildtype

235

levels in the blood, but impaired inhibitory activity against neutrophil elastase.28,29 We

236

speculate that this CoV2pp VNA assay may be capable of serving as a scalable means

237

by which one could screen for deficient AAT functionality and not simply abundance.

238

Considering that widespread screening of AAT is rarely performed in the absence of

239

emphysema, it is reasonable to expect that there may be more unidentified mutations

240

that impair abundance or function of AAT, which may subsequently result in aberrant

241

response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This undesired response by individuals with

242

functional AAT deficits may enable effective viral entry, dysregulated inflammation,

243

and/or coagulopathies (Fig. 4). It also raises the possibility that AAT may represent a

244

novel therapeutic approach in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.25

245
246

However, in the case of convalescent plasma therapies, the presence of AAT in blood

247

plasma from donors may play a beneficial role as non-immunoglobulin products are

248

currently not excluded from transfused plasma. In line with this, a recent meta-analysis

249

from Joyner et al suggests that convalescent plasma therapy is beneficial to its

250

recipients.30 While the purported benefits are attributed to the presence of neutralizing

251

antibodies, the authors also acknowledge that “other biological mechanisms” may

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.14.248880; this version posted August 15, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

252

contribute to these observations. Additionally, a recent bioRxiv report shows modest

253

benefits from the transfer of standard IVIG, suggesting that neutralizing antibodies are

254

not the only serum components that may play a role in alleviating the burden of COVID-

255

19 in patients.31 In its myriad roles, the transfer of AAT may provide additional benefits

256

to convalescent plasma recipients by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 entry, restraining

257

inflammation and/or moderating coagulation.

258
259

In sum, these findings highlight the importance of protease inhibitors in restricting

260

exogenous and/or endogenous protease-mediated enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 entry.

261

We also speculate that the diversity of AAT genotypes, the complex regulation of its

262

activity, and its myriad roles in inflammation and coagulation, implicates functional AAT

263

levels in COVID-19 pathogenicity. There is an urgent need to address:

264
265

1) The biologically relevant roles AAT, A2M, or other proteases play in tissue
restriction in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

266

2) The impact of variant AAT genotypes on the relative severity of COVID-19.

267

3) Whether treatment with, the already FDA-approved, AAT, may be able to play

268

a role in simultaneously controlling viral burden as well as aberrant immune

269

responses and if simultaneous treatment with A2M should be considered

270

given their ability to form inhibitor complexes.32

METHODS

273

Maintenance and generation of isogenic cell lines:

274

Vero-CCL81, parental 293T, and isogenic 293T cells were cultured in DMEM with 10%

275

heat inactivated FBS at 37ºC in the presence of 5% CO2. Isogenic 293T cell clones 5-7

276

and F8-2 were generated by lentivirus transduction to stably express ACE2 only or

277

ACE2 and TMPRSS2, respectively. ACE2 expression was under puromycin selection

278

and TMPRSS2 was under blasticidin selection as previously described.

rLuc-G* reporter virus, then virus supernatant collected and clarified 2 days post

285

infection prior to use. Trypsin treated CoV2pp were treated as previously described.1 All

286

pseudotyped viruses (PsV) were aliquoted prior to storage at -80ºC and tittered prior to

287

usage for neutralization experiments. Neutralization experiments were performed by

288

diluting the appropriate PsV with a 4-fold serial dilution of Albumin (Sigma-Aldrich,

289

A8763), alpha-1-antitrypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, SRP6312), alpha-2-Macroglobulin (Sigma-

290

Aldrich, SRP6314) or Nafamostat mesylate (Selleckchem, S1386). SARS-CoV-2

291

soluble RBD (sRBD) with human IgG-Fc was produced by the Lee Lab using a

292

recombinant Sendai virus expression platform (manuscript in preparation). De-identified

Plaque reduction neutralization titration (PRNT) by sera of SARS-CoV-2:

298

Neutralization experiments with live virus were performed by incubating sera with 50-

299

100 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 for one hour at 37ºC. All sera were diluted in serum free

300

DMEM. Serial dilutions started at a four-fold dilution and went through seven three-fold

301

serial dilutions. The virus-serum mixture was then used to inoculate Vero E6 cells for

302

one hour at 37ºC and 5% CO2. Cells were overlaid with EMEM medium (no FBS) and

303

1.25% Avicel, incubated for 3 days, and plaques were counted after staining with 1%

304

crystal violet in formalin.

322

entry by COVID seronegative sera. (A) Overview of SARS-CoV-2 entry. Three modes

323

of entry are displayed: (1) Entry mediated by endosomal proteases, such as Cathepsin

324

B, (2) entry mediated by cell surface proteases, such as TMPRSS2, and (3) entry

325

mediated by exogenous proteases, such as trypsin. This model was created in

326

Biorender. (B) Inhibition of trypsin treated CoV2pp entry by COVID seronegative sera.

327

Presented is a schematized version of the results presented in supplemental Figure 3A

328

of our previous publication. For this experiment, sera samples were incubated with

329

trypsin treated CoV2pp for 30mins prior to addition to Vero-CCL81 cells. Both the

330

CoV2pp and the sera samples were diluted in serum free media. The grey lines

331

represent COVID seronegative sera, they purple lines are COVID seropositive sera, and

332

the dashed lines are samples that were heat inactivated (HI) for 1hr at 56ºC prior to use

333

for CoV2pp neutralizations.

Figure 4. Putative relationship between alpha-1-antitrypsin function and SARS-

374

CoV-2. Differential alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) abundance and/or function may result in a

375

differential response to infection by SARS-CoV-2. Due to our observations that AAT can

376

inhibit CoV2pp protease-mediated entry, we expect that in the presence of functional

377

AAT (light blue, right) there is only modest amounts of SARS-CoV-2 protease-mediated

378

entry relative to those with AAT functional deficiencies (orange, left). In addition to its

379

entry effects, we speculate that normal AAT abundance and/or function may reign in an

380

otherwise dysregulated immune response. Moreover, AAT’s role in regulation of the

381

coagulation cascade may further prevent the development of coagulopathies. For the

382

latter, a normal immune response to infection is indicated by a single up arrow and the

383

absence of coagulopathy is indicated by a dash. Figure generated in Biorender.
