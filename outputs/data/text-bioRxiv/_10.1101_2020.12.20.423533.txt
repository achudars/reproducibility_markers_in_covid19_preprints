Summary
1

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused millions of deaths and will

2

continue to exact incalculable tolls worldwide. While great strides have been made toward

3

understanding and combating the mechanisms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2

4

(SARS-CoV-2) infection, relatively little is known about the individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins that

5

contribute to pathogenicity during infection and that cause neurological sequela after viral clearance. We

6

used Drosophila to develop an in vivo model that characterizes mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2

7

pathogenicity, and found ORF3a adversely affects longevity and motor function by inducing apoptosis

8

and inflammation in the nervous system.

9

CNS, arguing our Drosophila model is amenable to high throughput drug screening. Our work provides

10

novel insights into the pathogenic nature of SARS-CoV-2 in the nervous system that can be used to

11

develop new treatment strategies for post-viral syndrome.

Chloroquine alleviated ORF3a induced phenotypes in the

Main Text
12

SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in

13

more than 1.5 million deaths worldwide (JHU, 2020). To stem the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and control the

14

COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 research has primarily focused on understanding the mechanisms

15

of viral infection and transmission. For example, ACE2 encodes a SARS-CoV-2 receptor, and

16

humanized ACE2 transgenic mice have been developed to investigate the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2

17

infection in vivo (Jiang et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020). In contrast, relatively little is

18

known about how specific SARS-CoV-2 proteins induce pathogenesis (Kumar et al., 2020). The high

19

COVID-19 mortality rate suggests that proteins encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome are unusually

20

virulent. After the active SARS-CoV-2 infection is cleared, or no longer detectable, a majority of

21

recovering patients will experience post viral syndrome with indications that include neuropsychiatric

22

symptoms and extreme fatigue lasting for several months (Mooney et al., 2020; Townsend and Dyer,

23

2020). As recently developed vaccines begin to control the COVID-19 pandemic, it will be critically

24

important to identify the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 proteins cause pathogenesis in order to

25

develop treatments that mitigate the adverse affects associated with the sequela of infection.

26

The SARS-Cov-2 genome encodes 11 genes with 14 open reading frames (ORFs), that produce a

27

total of 29 proteins including 16 nonstructural proteins (NSP1-NSP16), 4 structural proteins (spike

28

protein [S)], membrane protein [M], nucleocapsid protein [N], envelope protein [E]), and 9 accessory

29

proteins (ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, ORF9b, ORF9c and ORF10)(Gordon et al.,

30

2020). The ORF3a protein is unique to coronaviruses and has been characterized in SARS-CoV, which

31

caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. SARS-CoV ORF3a triggers a

32

pathogenic inflammatory reaction through its interaction with TRAF3 that drives IL-1/IL-18 maturation

33

and ultimately causes severe lung damage through cell pyroptosis and apoptosis (Siu et al., 2019).

34

Moreover, SARS-CoV ORF3a induces vesicle formation and golgi fragmentation, which are prominent

35

features observed in patient samples (Freundt et al., 2010). SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a might also be

36

pathogenic. In vitro studies show SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a induces caspase-dependent apoptosis (Ren et

37

al., 2020), while in silico studies argue that the ORF3a mutation rate directly correlates with

38

SARS-CoV-2 mortality rates after infection (Majumdar and Niyogi, 2020). In addition, SARS-CoV-2

39

ORF3a facilitates virus replication by high jacking the autophagy machinery; despite 72.36% amino acid

40

identity between the ORF3a proteins (Fig. S1A), SARS-CoV ORF3a does not promote viral replication

41

(Qu et al., 2020). Although these studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a has unique pathogenic

42

functions that contribute to the relatively high COVID-19 mortality rate, an in vivo model has yet to be

43

developed that specifically interrogates the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a pathogenicity.

44

To date, clinical treatments are not available that alleviate SARS-CoV-2 post viral syndrome.

45

Identifying drugs that treat COVID-19 remains an urgent need, but the low availability of hACE2

46

transgenic mice and the requirement for P3-level infrastructure to handle SARS-CoV-2 viruses prevents

47

a vast majority of laboratories from conducting COVID-19 research. An alternative strategy is to develop

48

in vivo models of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity in which candidate drugs targeting specific viral proteins

49

can be tested for protection against pathogenic outcomes. Promising therapeutic strategies would

50

include compounds that block hyperinflammation and apoptosis induced by pathogenic viral proteins

51

(Freeman and Swartz, 2020; van den Berg and Te Velde, 2020; Yap et al., 2020).

52

The powerful genetic tools in Drosophila have been used to identify essential mechanisms that

53

underlie viral infections (Hao et al., 2008; Hughes et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2018), and that contribute to

54

viral pathogenicity (Adamson et al., 2011; Chan et al., 2009; Harsh et al., 2020). In addition, the short

55

lifespan with easy-to-score visible phenotypes has made the fruit fly a productive in vivo drug screening

56

platform (Chang et al., 2008; Dar et al., 2012; Su, 2019; Willoughby et al., 2013). Here, we report the

57

development and characterization of an in vivo Drosophila model that assays SARS-CoV-2 proteins for

58

tissue-specific pathogenicity and that can successfully identify drug candidates that mitigate pathogenic

59

SARS-CoV-2 proteins.

60

We constructed a transgenic fly that placed ORF3a under UAS control. SARS-CoV-2 infection

61

shows a strong tissue preference, most notably affecting the respiratory system, due to the usual route

62

of infection and the relative abundance of ACE2 among tissues (Hikmet et al., 2020; Puelles et al., 2020).

63

To understand if SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity can also be tissue-specific, we used the bipartite

64

GAL4/UAS system to express ORF3a in the central nervous system (CNS; elav.Gal4), in photoreceptors

65

(GMR.Gal4), and in striated and smooth muscle (Mef2.Gal4). Each Gal4 driver robustly induced ORF3a

66

expression (Fig. 1A, S1B,C), but appreciable phenotypes were only observed in flies that expressed

67

ORF3a in the nervous system. ORF3a expression in the CNS significantly reduced lifespan (control

68

median survival>14d, n=60; elav>ORF3a=5.0d, n=65; Fig 1B), impaired motor function in longitudinal

69

climbing assays (average performance elav>ORF3a =1.9% of control, n>60 per genotype; Fig. 1C, S1D),

70

and induced pronounced abdominal swelling (>90% individuals, n=65, Fig. S1E). Fewer elav>ORF3a

71

adult flies eclosed than expected (49.5% of expected, n=188; Fig. 1D), suggesting ORF3a caused

72

partial lethality during larval stages. In addition, flies that expressed ORF3a in photoreceptors showed a

73

rough eye phenotype, which is consistent with defects in ommatidia patterning and apoptosis (100%

74

affected, n>100; Fig. 1E). Surprisingly, ORF3a expression in muscle did not significantly affect longevity,

75

motor function, or muscle patterning (Fig. 1F, S1F). Consistent with these results, >35% of COVID-19

76

patients showed neurological symptoms whereas <10% of patients showed musculoskeletal

77

complications (Mao et al., 2020). These studies argue that ORF3a is pathogenic in only a subset of

78

tissues, and that the CNS is particularly sensitive to ORF3a expression.

79

After establishing a primary infection in the respiratory system, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can

80

pass the blood-brain barrier and efficiently infect the CNS (Glass et al., 2004; Meinhardt et al., 2020;

81

Puelles et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020), and SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with a host of

82

neurological symptoms including impaired consciousness, stroke, concentration problems, memory loss,

83

dizziness and insomnia (Mao et al., 2020). Reduced lifespan and impaired motor function in

84

elav>ORF3a flies are phenotypes indicative of neurodegeneration (Moore et al., 2018), so we assessed

85

apoptosis in the adult brain, and found that ORF3a induced Caspase-3 cleavage (Fig. 1G).

86

Neuroinflammation is often seen in COVID-19 patients, possibly via damage-associated molecular

87

patterns (DAMPs) induced TLR4-MyD88 signaling activation (Meinhardt et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2020;

88

Zhou et al., 2020). In Drosophila, non-infectious sterile inflammation can be initiated when necrotic cells

89

release DAMPs that in turn activate immunoinflammatory pathways, including the Toll and IMD

90

pathways (Kosakamoto et al., 2020; Obata et al., 2014). We hypothesized that ORF3a elicits a sterile

91

inflammatory response, and found that expressing ORF3a in the CNS induced Toll pathway reporter

92

expression (fold change vs control, Drs=10.2; Fig. 1H) and IMD reporter expression (dipt=28.8,

93

attA=55.9)(Yang et al., 2019). We also assayed eiger expression, which is a marker for Jun kinase

94

(JNK)-mediated inflammation and apoptosis (Li et al., 2019), but eiger expression was not significantly

95

changed in elav>ORF3a flies (Fig. 1I). These data demonstrate that ORF3a expression alone is

96

sufficient to cause apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and neurotropism, and suggest ORF3a is a major

97

virulence factor of SARS-CoV-2. Thus our ORF3a transgenic fly model recapitulates hallmarks of

98

SARS-CoV-2 infection reported in patients and cell culture systems.

99

We next wanted to understand if our ORF3a model could be used to identify COVID-19 treatments.

100

In Vero cells, lysosome deacidification is essential for virus egress, and ORF3a localized to lysosomes

101

and caused lysosome deacidification (Ghosh et al., 2020).

102

deacidification in U2OS cells, and chloroquine phosphate (CQ) blocked chemically induced

103

deacidification (Mauthe et al., 2018). Although CQ did not consistently prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections

104

in clinical trials, the ORF3a lysosome studies suggested that CQ could prevent ORF3a-induced tropism.

105

To understand if our fly model could respond to COVID-19 treatments, we tested the efficacy of CQ in

106

mitigating ORF3a phenotypes. CQ treated elav>ORF3a flies showed significantly longer lifespans

4

Toxic stress also caused lysosome

107

(elav>ORF3a median survival=6d, n=121; elav>ORF3a+CQ=14d, n=79; Fig 2A), and improved motor

108

function compared to untreated controls (average performance elav>ORF3a=1.3% of control;

109

elav>ORF3a+CQ=9.8% of control; n>60 per genotype; Fig 2B). In addition, more CQ treated

110

elav>ORF3a adult flies eclosed than untreated controls (treated=72.4% of expected, n=174;

111

untreated=49.5%; Fig. 2C), suggesting CQ can suppress ORF3a induced larval lethality. These proof of

112

principle studies largely validate our ORF3a Drosophila model as an efficient COVID-19 drug-screening

113

platform.

114

At the molecular level, CQ treated elav>ORF3a flies showed reduced cleaved-caspase-3 levels

115

(untreated FC=2.3; treated FC=1.3; Figure 2D), and reduced Toll pathway activity (Drs; FC=0.43 vs

116

untreated; Fig. 2E) compared to untreated controls. However, IMD pathway reporters did not respond to

117

CQ treatment (dipt=0.75, attA=0.89). One mechanism that might explain CQ specificity is that the Toll

118

pathway is a more direct target of necrotic derived DAMPs, while the IMD pathway is not (Kosakamoto

119

et al., 2020). A second mechanism of action for CQ could involve ORF3a-induced lysosome dysfunction.

120

LysoTracker is a vital dye that accumulates in acidic organelles and is often used as a marker for

121

lysosome function (Sanman et al., 2016). Similar to Vero cells, ORF3a promoted lysosome

122

deacidification in HeLa cells (Fig. 2G,H). Strikingly, we found CQ treatment efficiently blunted ORF3a

123

induced deacidification (Fig. 2G,H). While CQ showed no effect on inpatient survival (Geleris et al.,

124

2020), our results argue CQ prevents apoptosis and lysosome dysfunction in ORF3a-expressing cells,

125

and suggest CQ could ameliorate symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 post viral syndrome in

126

recovering patients (Fig. 2I).

127

The sequela of SARS-CoV-2 infection includes extensive neurological complications such as

128

problems with concentration, memory loss, anxiety and depression (Halpin et al., 2020). Since the

129

duration and severity of persistent symptoms among COVID-19 survivors is continuing to emerge,

130

understanding and treating COVID-19 post viral syndrome will be a high healthcare priority over the next

131

several years. Time course studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection, replication, and clearance have yet to be

132

reported in detail, but infection parameters have been defined for the closely related SARS-CoV in mice

133

(Glass et al., 2004). SARS-CoV was detectable in the lungs for up to 9 days after an initial nasal

5

134

inoculation, and then spread to the CNS where the virus was detectable for an additional 6 days (Glass

135

et al., 2004). Interestingly, after infectious SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and the coronavirus Middle East

136

Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV has been cleared, viral RNA continues to be detectable in many

137

tissues (Glass et al., 2004; Sia et al., 2020; Widagdo et al., 2019).

138

Our study revealed ORF3a expression in the nervous system alone can induce cell death and

139

neuroinflammation, suggesting ORF3a is the major virulence factor contributing to SARS-CoV-2

140

induced neurotropism (Figs. 1B,C). In addition, the gold standard PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test can

141

only assess viral load in the respiratory system. After SARS-CoV-2 is cleared from the respiratory

142

system, and a patient tests negative, SARS-CoV-2 may continue to replicate in the CNS (Fig. 2J). The

143

residual ORF3a may continue to trigger neurological complications associated with post viral syndrome

144

in recovering patients, suggesting continued medical treatments are in fact required for full recovery

145

after a ‘negative’ PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test.

146

In summary, our results warrant further studies of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenic mechanisms as a

147

means to treat COVID-19 post viral syndrome and identify ORF3a as a high priority target that is

148

amenable to drug treatment (Fig. 2A,B). A future drug screen with ORF3a transgenic flies will likely

149

reveal post-viral syndrome treatments beyond CQ.

Materials and methods
Drosophila genetics
249

The Gal4 stocks used to express SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a in brain, eye, and muscle included

250

P{GAL4-elav.L} (Bloomington Stock Center, 8760), P{GAL4-ninaE.GMR} (Bloomington Stock Center,

251

1104), and P{Mef2-GAL4.247} (Bloomington Stock Center, 50742). Flies were maintained on standard

252

“Bloomington recipe” media, and cultured at 25 °C under a normal light/dark cycle, unless otherwise

253

noted.
Transgenic Flies

254

UAS-SARS-CoV-2-ORF3a transgenic flies were generated by PCR-mediated subcloning of the

255

SARS-CoV-2-ORF3a coding sequence (pDONR207 SARS-CoV-2 ORF3A, #141271, Addgene) into

256

pUASt-Attb (EcoRI/XbaI). ORF3a was amplified with Takara PrimerSTAR PCR enzyme (R050B, Takara)

257

using the following primers:

258

ORF3a-CDS-Forward- CGGAATTCATGGACCTGTTCATGAGAATCTT

259

ORF3a-CDS-Rerverse-GCTCTAGATTACAGTGGCACGGAGGTG

260

Plasmid DNA was injected and targeted to a C31 integration site at 22A2 (Bloomington Stock 24481,

261

Rainbow Transgenic Flies); stable insertions were identified by standard methods.
Immunohistochemistry and imaging

262

Antibodies used include anti-SARS-CoV-2-ORF3a (1:200, 101AP, FabGennix International Inc),

263

anti-Tropomyosin (1:600, MAC141, Abcam). Embryo and brain antibody staining was performed as

264

described (Yang et al., 2019). Tissues were imaged with a Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope. For

265

Drosophila eye imaging, UAS-ORF3a/TM3, Sb flies were crossed with GMR-gal4 virgin flies to direct

266

expression of ORF3a in eyes. For wild type control, w1118 flies were crossed with GMR-gal4 virgin flies.

267

Flies were crossed at 25°C for two days; the progeny were raised at 29°C, and female adults were

268

collected at day 3 post eclosure. Flies were frozen at −80°C for at least 24 h and imaged with a ZEISS

269

Axio Zoom V16 Microscope. Projected in-focus images were produced with the Montage Multifocus

270

module of the Zen Pro Software.

Cell culture
271

pCMV-GFP-SARS-CoV-ORF3a was generated by recombining the SARS-CoV-2-ORF3a coding

272

sequence (pDONR207 SARS-CoV-2 ORF3A, #141271, Addgene) into pDEST-CMV-N-EGFP (#122842,

273

Addgene). For LysoTracker staining, Hela cells were seeded in 6-well plates with cover slips and grown

274

to 50% confluency at 37°C with 5%CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (12430047, Invitrogen)

275

supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (A4766801, Invitrogen). Cells were then transfected with

276

1000ng DNA, using standard Lipofectamine 3000 protocols (L3000008, Invitrogen). Media was changed

277

to DMEM with or without 10 µM chloroquine diphosphate (C6628, Sigma) 6h post transfection. 24h latter,

278

media was removed, and cells were incubated with 10 nM LysoTracker Red DND-99 (L7528, Invitrogen)

279

for 1h. Cells was washed with PBS for three times, mounted and imaged with a Zeiss LSM800 confocal

280

microscope.
Western blotting

281

For each sample, 10 adult female heads were homogenized in 200 µl IP buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH=7.4,

282

150 nM NaCl, 1% NP40, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1X proteinase

283

inhibitor), incubated on ice for 30 min and large debris was removed by 15min centrifugation (12,000Xg).

284

Anti-cleaved-caspase 3 (#9661, Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-beta-actin (E7-C, DSHB) were

285

used for immunoblotting. Western blots were performed by standard method using precast gels

286

(#456-1096, BioRad), and imaged with the ChemiDoc XRS+ system (BioRad).
Longevity and motor function assays

287

1d old adult flies were collected and transferred to fresh food daily for both assays. For longevity

288

analysis, the number of dead flies was recorded daily. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated,

289

and statistical analysis was performed using log-rank analysis (Prism9, GraphPad Software). To assess

290

motor function climbing assays were performed at described (Moore et al., 2018). Briefly, 15-20 flies

291

were placed into empty vials (9.5 cm high,1.7 cm in diameter) with flat bottoms, the flies were forced to

292

the bottom of a vial by firmly tapping the vial against the bench surface. Eight seconds after the tap, the

293

number of flies that climbed up the walls of a vial above the 5-cm mark was recorded as positive.

in vivo drug treatment
294

40mg/ml chloroquine phosphate (CQ, Sigma, C6628) was dissolved in water, and 40mg of CQ was

295

added to each 30g of fresh fly media. Adult flies were placed on treated food at 25°C for 2d and then

296

transferred. Progeny were cultured on CQ food from embryo stage to eclosion and transferred 24hr later

297

to normal media (to prevent adults from sticking to wet, treated media).
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR

298

Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (15596026, Invitrogen), and quantitated with a Nanodrop 2000

299

(Thermo Fisher). cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription with All-in-One 5X RT MasterMix (G592,

300

Applied Biological Materials Inc) with 1000ng RNA. BlasTaq 2X qPCR MasterMix (G891, Applied

301
