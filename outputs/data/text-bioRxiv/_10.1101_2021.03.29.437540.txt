Abstract
Zoonotically transmitted coronaviruses were responsible for three disease outbreaks since 2002, with
the “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2” (SARS-CoV-2) causing the dramatic
“Coronavirus Disease-2019” (CoViD-19) pandemic, which affected public health, economy, and
society on a global scale. The impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic permeate into our environment
and wildlife as well; in particular, concern has been raised about the viral occurrence and persistence
in aquatic and marine ecosystems. The discharge of untreated wastewaters carrying infectious SARS-

CoV-2 into natural water systems that are home of sea mammals may have dramatic consequences
on vulnerable species.
The efficient transmission of coronaviruses raise questions regarding the contributions of virusreceptors interactions. The main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2
(ACE-2), serving as a functional receptor for the viral spike (S) protein.

This study was aimed,

through the comparative analysis of the ACE-2 receptor with the human one, at assessing the
susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 of the different species of marine mammals living in Italian waters.
We also determined, by means of immunohistochemistry, ACE-2 receptor localization in the lung
tissue from different cetacean species, in order to provide a preliminary characterization of ACE-.2
expression in the marine mammals’ respiratory tract.
Furthermore, in order to evaluate if and how wastewater management in Italy may lead to susceptible
marine mammal populations being exposed to the virus, geo-mapping data of wastewater plants,
associated to the identification of specific stretches of coast more exposed to extreme weather events,
overlapped to marine mammal population data, were carried out. Results showed the SARS-CoV-2
exposure for marine mammals inhabiting Italian coastal waters. Thus, we highlight the potential
hazard of reverse zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with its impact on marine
mammals regularly inhabiting the Mediterranean Sea, whilst also stressing the need of appropriate
action to prevent further damage to specific vulnerable populations.

Significance Statement
Growing concern exists that SARS-CoV-2, as already ascertained for its SARS-CoV and MERSCoV “predecessors”, originated from an animal “reservoir”, performing thereafter its spillover into
mankind, that was possibly anticipated by viral “passage” into a secondary animal host. Within the
dramatic SARS-CoV-2 pandemic context, hitherto characterized by over 110 million cases and
almost 2,500,000 deaths on a global scale, several domestic and wild animal species have been
reported as susceptible to natural and/or experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this respect, while

some marine mammal species are deemed as potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection on the
basis of the sequence homology of their ACE-2 viral receptor with the human one, this study
addresses such a critical issue also in stranded sea mammal specimens.

Introduction
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) officially declared the “novel
CoronaVirus Disease” (CoViD-19) outbreak, caused by the “Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus-2” (SARS-CoV-2), a global pandemic. In Europe, Italy was one of the Countries where
the earliest cases of CoViD-19 were reported, representing at the same time the third European Nation
most infected at present, with 2,466,813 cases, more than 90,000 of which fatal, at the date of January
28,

2021

(https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases).

Several

works report confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stools and urine from infected patients
(La Rosa et al 2020; Sun et al 2020; Xiao et al 2020) with some reports confirm the presence of both
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 genome fragments in wastewater, sewage sludge, and river waters
around the world (Wang et al 2005, Tran et al 2020, Collivignarelli et al 2020). SARS-CoV-2 can
remain active for up to 25 days at 5 °C in water sources, based on in vitro studies (Shutler et al.,
2020), and can survive in water, in a wide range of pH values (3-10) at room temperature (Chin et al
2020). Contaminated water sources can deliver the equivalent of >100 SARS-CoV-2 genome copies
with 100 mL or less water in Countries with a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Shutler et
al., 2020).
These data increase the possibility that wastewater, besides representing a potential, non-invasive
early warning tool for monitoring the status and trends of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Wurtzer et al 2020;
Randazzo et al 2020), may also provide a significant spreading vehicle for this coronavirus (La Rosa
et al., 2020). Domestic wastewaters are managed through different treatments: i) primary
(sedimentation), ii) secondary (biological), that combines aeration tanks with secondary
sedimentation to retain the activated sludge, iii) tertiary (more stringent), that includes various

processes used to further reduce pathogen concentrating and ensure virus-free effluent, e.g. sand
filtration and disinfection. The available data, referring to Spain, Italy (Rimoldi et al 2020; La Rosa
et al 2020), France (Wurtzer et al 2020) and Ecuador (Guerrero-Latorre et al 2020), suggest that non
treated, primary treated and, in some cases, also secondary treated wastewater effluents may represent
a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 transmission (Randazzo et al 2020, Rimoldi et al 2020). These
investigations emphasize the limitations of the conventional wastewater treatment processes in
reducing SARS-CoV-2 RNA with the possible spread in the aquatic environment including marine
waters. Two studies, in fact, have documented the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in an Italian and a
Japanese river, without viral isolation (Rimoldi et al 2020; Haramoto et al 2020). Furthermore, it
should be noted that extreme weather events (e.g. heavy rainfalls, storms, and floods) associated to
global warming, can play a relevant role. Specifically, the rapid warming reported in the last decades
in the Mediterranean Sea basin (Gallus et al, 2018), may occasionally flush untreated or not efficiently
treated sewage into rivers and coastal waters when treatment plants reach their capacity and start to
fail (Funari et al 2012). These events could represent a possible risk for susceptible species living
close to the shore, as marine mammals.
These aquatic species, in fact, were recently added to a long list of animal species susceptible to
natural and/or experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection (Di Guardo, 2020; Mathavarajah et al, 2020). In
details, experimental infections and binding-affinity assays between the “receptor binding domain”
(RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2
(ACE-2), demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 has a wide host range due to the high similarity of this
protein among difference species (Cao et al, 2020; Zappulli et al., 2021). Among those animals
species showing a higher similarities with the human ACE-2 RBDs (Luan et al., 2020; Nabi and
Khan, 2020, Mathavarajah et al 2020), marine mammals seems to have a higher binding efficiency
(Mathavarajah et al 2020) and, for these reasons, an infection can be caused by low viral
concentration, as those likely present in wastewater (Mordecai et al 2020).

The present study is aimed to evaluate the susceptibility of marine mammals stranded along the Italian
coastlines to SARS-CoV-2 comparing the amino acid sequences of their ACE-2 receptor and
assessing the possible menaces to their conservation related to the anthropogenic transmission of
SARS-CoV-2. The presence of the ACE-2 receptor molecule in lung tissue of stranded sea mammals
by means of immunohistochemistry (IHC) considering the abundance and distribution patterns of the
viral receptor, considering that more receptor availability could enhance viral entry into cells;
alternatively, ACE-2 may play a protective role against lung (and cardio-vascular) injury through its
enzymatic activity (Albini et al., 2020).

Susceptibility of the marine mammal species examined to SARS-CoV-2

Our analyses have predicted which species of Mediterranean Sea mammals living in Italian waters
are most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection by assessing the primary sequence homology level of
their ACE-2 receptor with the human one.
At present, in the whole Mediterranean Sea, 12 marine mammal species are listed as regular: 11
Cetaceans (Balaenoptera physalus, Physeter macrocephalus, Ziphius cavirostris, Globicephala
melas, Orcinus orca, Grampus griseus, Tursiops truncatus, Stenella coeruleoalba, Delphinus delphis
Delphinus capensis, Steno bredanensis) and 1 Pinniped (Monachus monachus). Moreover, the
presence of other three species is considered as irregular (Balaenoptera acutorostrata, Pseudorca
crassidens, Megaptera novaengliae) (Table 1).
Out of the 15 aforementioned species, the ACE-2 amino acid sequence was available on the NCBI
database for 8 of them (B. physalus, P. macrocephalus, Z. cavirostris, G. melas, O. orca, T. truncatus,
B. acutorostrata, M. novaengliae).

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.29.437540; this version posted March 29, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

Among the species lacking ACE-2 sequence-related data, no informations were publicly available
before our study on S. coeruleoalba (a species commonly occurring around the world in temperate
waters), for which these data were obtained experimentally.
Based on 25 amino acid residues selected, the sequences collected from the 9 concerned species, as
compared with the corresponding ones from the human ACE-2 receptor, are shown in Table 2. Based
upon the primary structure homology level of their ACE-2 molecule with the human one, the majority
of Cetacea species analysed (7/9 species) were predicted to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2
infection (B. physalus; G. melas; T. truncatus; O. orca; S. coeruleoalba; B. acutorostrata; M.
novaengliae), with the remaining two species (P. macrocephalus; Z. cavirostris) being predicted as
“medium susceptibility” species (Table 3).
More in detail, in all examined marine mammal genomes the binding residues D30 and M82 of ACE
2 were both mutated; however, these two mutations did not apparently exert a prominent destabilizing
effect on the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein’s RBD to ACE-2 (Damas et al, 2020), not affecting
the predicted susceptibility of the concerned cetacean species to SARS-CoV-2. Instead, the L79 and
M82 mutations detected in (P. macrocephalus as well as in Z. cavirostris impacted the binding affinity
of the virus to ACE-2, thereby decreasing the predicted susceptibility of the latter two species to
SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 3).

The IUCN status for the investigated species is available at a different geographic range. The killer
whale (O.orca) from the Gibraltar Strait subpopulation is the only Critically Endangered species in
the Mediterranean Sea.
Fin whale (B.physalus), common bottlenose (T.truncatus) and striped dolphins (S.coeruleoalba) are
all Vulnerable at the Mediterranean scale but display a different assessment at the Italian range (Near
threatened and Least Concern, respectively).

Pilot whale (G.melas) and Cuvier’s beaked whale (Z.cavirostris) are Data Deficient at both scales,
with no differences between Mediterranean and Italian ranges being reported for the status of the
sperm whale (Endangered).
Finally, both minke (B.acutorostrata) and humpback (M.novaengliae) whales have not been assessed
for the Mediterranean Sea, given their irregular occurrence in the Basin.

The results of the comparison between IUCN conservation status and SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility for
the 9 herein investigated cetacean species are summarized in Table 3.

Wastewater treatment plants conditions, hydrogeological vulnerability, and risk to marine

mammals species in Italian seas

The identification of wastewater treatment plants and the assessment of the municipality contribution
in terms of untreated or not sufficient treated wastewater discharge into natural water systems can
help to predict the potential hotpots for a spillover event.

In Italy, wastewaters are treated by primary, secondary, and more stringent treatment plants
(WWTPs).
Considering the potential risk of plants located in big municipalities (agglomerations ≥ 150 000 p.e.),
we have found that the big municipalities of the northern and central Regions of our Country rely
mostly on more stringent treatment plants, with few exceptions (Fig 1 SM), represented in particular
by the city of Trieste, in North-Eastern Italy with a predominance of primary treatment plants, as
well as by the city of Pescara, in Central Italy, with a majority of secondary treatment plants.
By contrast, the big municipalities in Southern Italy have a large number of secondary treatment
plants and, in some cities (Catania, Cosenza), a rate of wastewaters not collected in sewerage systems

is reported, along with a rate not submitted to treatments or characterized by lack of information
(Catania).
Considering the potential release of SARS-CoV-2 (as well as of other oro-fecally transmitted, viral
and non-viral agents) into the effluents of primary and secondary plants upstream of relevant rivers,
we identified the North Adriatic Sea and the Ligurian Sea as basins at risk for potential introduction
of effluents into the Po and Arno rivers. Moreover, considering the location of some plants with low
sanitization guarantees close to the shores of central and southern Italy, we recognized an additional
risk factor for the Central Adriatic Sea, the Northern and Southern Ionian Sea, and the South-Eastern
Tyrrhenian Sea.
Taking into account the urban wastewater treatment plants from agglomerations ≥ 2000 p.e
(UWWTD) and, focusing in particular on their location along the entire shoreline, we identified that
some coastal areas, with a prevalence of primary and secondary plants, appear at high risk, as well as
the water basins on which they overlook (Ligurian Sea, Central Adriatic Sea, South-Eastern
Tyrrhenian Sea, Northern and Southern Ionian Sea and Sicilian Channel) (Fig. 2 SM).
More in detail, focusing on plants with more stringent treatments, as disinfection (chlorination, UV,
ozonisation), sand filtration, micro filtration (e.g. membrane filtration), or other types of unspecified
additional treatment, we considered the potential risk of UWWTD not applying the disinfection,
along with their location close to the shores, and we recognized at risk the basins of the Northern
Adriatic Sea, the Central Adriatic Sea, and the Central Tyrrhenian Sea (Fig. 3 SM).
Moreover, considering the coastal areas more exposed to landslides and flood hazard, we identified
the coastline of the Ligurian Sea and of the Central and South-Eastern Tyrrhenian Sea as sites
potentially at risk for occasional over-flooding of sewage treatment plants and release of wastewater
not fully treated, which may transfer, at their turn, microbial pathogens from distant sources to coastal
waters. (FIG.4 SM)

Overall, we identified some high-risk areas for a potential SARS-CoV-2 spillover to sea mammals,
as summarized in Figure 1, which correspond to (clockwise) the Northern Adriatic and Central
Adriatic Seas, the Northern and Southern Ionian Sea, the Strait of Sicily, and the whole Tyrrhenian
and the Ligurian Seas.
The risk areas indicated by the study host several cetacean species, as shown in Fig. 1. The map has
been created considering the data available in the IV Italian Report to the Habitat Directive; given the
irregular status of both minke and humpback whales, coupled with the occurrence of pilot and killer
whales, these species are not reported in the map.

From the map is clear the overlap between the inferred risky areas with the main distribution of the
species; noteworthy, the concerned map should be viewed as a synthesis and a generalization of the
available data on cetaceans’ distribution in the seas around the Italian peninsula. In this respect, more
detailed data are available, even on a small-scale base and these would increase the species range
displayed in Figure 1. In such a context, a suitable area for the fin whale should be much more
extended on a seasonal basis to all the Ligurian Sea, representing a well know summer fishing ground
for this species (Panigada et al., 2017)

The distribution of the P. macrocephalus overlaps the North Tyrrhenian and the Ligurian Seas, B.
physalus distribution overlaps the North Tyrrhenian Sea, the Ligurian Sea and the Strait of Sicily, and
T. truncatus distribution overlaps the Ligurian sea, the whole Tyrrhenian Sea area, the Strait of Sicily,
the North and Central Adriatic Sea.
S. coeruleoalba distribution overlaps the Ligurian sea, the whole Tyrrhenian Sea area, the Strait of
Sicily and the Ionian Sea.
Z. cavirostris overlaps the North Tyrrhenian Sea.
G. griseus distribution overlaps the Ligurian Sea, the Strait of Sicily and the Ionian Sea.

Immunohistochemical (IHC) characterization and pulmonary location of ACE-2

Because ACE2 protein shares its role as cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2, several researches have
been focusing on ACE2 expression in various organs, especially in respiratory system which can be
the entrance of SARS-CoV-2.
ACE-2 receptor was already been described and IHC characterized in numerous mammalian species;
unlike terrestrial mammal, the lungs of cetaceans undergo anatomical and physiological adaptations
that facilitate extended breath-holding during dives. For these reasons and to investigate the presence
and location of ACE-2 receptor in marine mammals, lung tissue of 7 cetacean species were IHC tested
(Table 6).
All the examined species showed lung tissue immunolabelling for ACE-2 antibody. In particular, the
most remarkable finding of IHC investigations was the detection of ACE-2 expression on the surface
of alveolar (type I pneumocytes) and bronchiolar epithelial cells. Furthermore, ACE-2-specific
immunoreactivity (IR) was observed in endoalveolar macrophages as well as in the endothelium and
in smooth muscle cells of pulmonary vessels (Figs 2-3).
The results of this study should be considered as a preliminary starting point for further studies.

Discussion
In general, the conservation status of the Mediterranean cetaceans is under pressure from
anthropogenic disturbance and the populations of the species highlighted in the study are greatly
impacted by several sources of human activities. Incidental mortality in fishing operations, collisions
with ship, ingestion of debris, seismic surveys, naval exercises, chemical pollution, and viral
infections are just some of the threats faced by the cetaceans inhabiting the Mediterranean Sea Basin
(Fossi et al., 2005; Cozar et al., 2015; Panigada et al., 2006 Di Guardo & Mazzariol, 2013). Most of

the aforementioned factors can have a direct effect on the individuals, while indirect effects on the
medium long-term period are represented by a general habitat degradation.
Marine mammals may be exposed to environmental stressors such as chemical pollutants, harmful
algal biotoxins and emerging or resurging pathogens; this phenomenon may be related to complex
factors such as climate change, toxins, and immunosuppression, with coastal marine mammals
particularly at risk since many inhabit an environment more affected by human activity (Bossart,
2006). Besides threats of anthropic origin menacing their conservation, infectious diseases represent
a global issues, in particular morbilliviruses (Van Bressem et al., 2014; Duignan et al. 2014). These
RNA viruses, currently endemic in the Mediterranean, showed in the recent years an apparently
increased tendency to cross species infection causing epidemic events in different species through
spill-over events. Phylogenetic analyses support the idea of a common ancestor of morbillivirus
affecting aquatic animals, namely cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) with those reported in terrestrial
ones and recent reports of this virus in more terrestrial animals (i.e. otters and seals) suggest a travel
back to land of this virus (Di Guardo and Mazzariol 2019)
Impact of human on wildlife during a global pandemic may include the potential transmission of
novel virus to susceptible animals (Mathavarajah et al. 2020). In our study we identified species of
marine mammals living along italian coastline and we evaluete the conservation of the SARS-CoV2 viral ACE-2 receptor across species.

It has been shown how ACE-2 variability explains why certain species are susceptible to SARSCoV-2, while others are not (Mathavarajah and Dellaire, 2020); ACE-2, an extracellular peptidase
originally characterized as SARS-CoV receptor, has been subsequently identified as the main
SARS-CoV-2 receptor. The S protein binding region is located in the ACE-2 catalytic site (Li et al,
2005), with some amino acid residues at a particular position in the human ACE-2 sequence playing
a crucial role in virus-host cell interaction (Li et al, 2020, Wan et al, 2020); these binding residues

determine the degree of susceptibility, thus likely representing the main drivers for cross-species
transmission (Wan et al, 2020).
Our analyses revealed that a group of closely related cetaceans (O orca, G melas, T truncatus and S
coeruleoalba) is predicted to be highly susceptible to the virus, hence at potential risk of acquiring
SARS-CoV-“ infection whenever exposed to the viral pathogen. One of the main aim of this study
was to evaluate ACE-2 abundance and distribution, by means of IHC, in cetacean lungs, thereby
supporting our parallel and comparative investigations on ACE-2 amino acid sequences, aimed at
assessing the susceptibility of marine mammals to SARS-CoV-2 infection; in this respect, IHC
analyses could identify a number of potential routes of infection for SARS-CoV-2, along with the
viral spread and replication sites throughout the body. Given the IR patterns found, the expression of
ACE-2 in macrophages and their role in antiviral defense mechanisms (as in the case of SARS-CoV2 infection) should be emphasized; Abassi et al. have hypothesized that, while lung macrophages
play an important role in antiviral defense mechanisms, they could also serve as a “Trojan horse” for
SARS-CoV-2, thus enabling viral anchoring within the pulmonary parenchyma.

A variable

expression of ACE-2 on macrophages among individuals might also govern the severity of SARSCoV-2 infection (Abassi et al, 2020), although additional studies are required. Our findings suggest
that ACE-2 expression can vary between different lung regions and between individuals (in particular,
if they belong to different species).

Reports of pathogens of terrestrial origins in marine mammals has already been observed, as the case

of Toxoplasma gondii, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes and often an exposure to
untreated wastewater was deemed to be the possible source (Grattarola et al, 2019, Grattarola et al,
2016).
As other fecal pathogens, SARS-CoV-2 is through the sewage system, thereby gaining access into
wastewater treatment plants, whenever existing, and/or, more in general, the aquatic environment.

In this respect, Italy is characterized by heterogeneous geographic systems, with sea surface waters
surrounding the Italian peninsula. Spaces and distances granted to the hydrographic network by the
mountains and by the sea are mostly very modest, making the territory particularly exposed and
vulnerable to alluvial events, known as sudden floods or flash floods, often triggered by short and
intense

weather

phenomena
idrogeologico

/Rapporto_Dissesto_Idrogeologico_ISPRA_287_2018_Web.pdf.). Compared to the unpredictability
of flood events, there is still a sort of repetition in the occurrence of the events themselves, and some
portions of our National territory, due to the morphological characteristics and use of soil, are
configured as hydrological hazard-prone areas, including coastal areas.
The present study identified some high-risk areas where insufficient wastewater treatment may occur
in the vicinity of marine mammals, putting them at risk for infection by a fecally transmitted zoonotic
pathogen like SARS-CoV-2 when they swim and feed. It is clear that several data and information
are still missing as the survival time into the marine environment and the effects of marine currents
and dilution factors which can lower the possibility of infection. Furthermore it should be noted that
SARS-CoV-2 has been found in wastewater, there is no data on its actual possibility of survival and
dispersion in seawater.
Analyzing wastewater management practices in Italy, we identified that some wastewater treatment
plants in the vicinity of marine mammals utilizing tertiary treatment, which rules out the possibility
of virus exposure in these areas. However there were locations (the coastline of the Ligurian Sea and
of the Central and South-East Thyrrenian Sea) that bordered marine mammals population at risk for
occasionally over-flooding of sewage treatment plants and release of wastewater not fully treated.
The number of areas identified at risk could be underestimated, as we considered areas characterized
by inadequate treatments, while in some cases other coexisting conditions, like problematic sewage
overflow or pipe exfiltration, represent a risk. Overall, considering all these factors we identified
some high -risk areas for a potential virus spillover (Figure 1), which correspond to North Adriatic

Sea, Ligurian Sea, Central Adriatic Sea, North and South Ionian Sea, Central Tyrrhenian Sea, SouthEast Thyrrenian Sea, Sicilian Channel.
The impact of a possible viral spillover could have on coastal marine mammal communities remains
to be determined. Our study, in fact, confirm a high susceptibility of sea mammals to SARS-CoV-2
infection based on the receptor homology, as reported in previous studies (Mathavarajah et al.,2020).
The effects of SARS-CoV-2 on marine mammals are currently unknown, although coronavirus
infections have been reported in marine mammals prior to the CoViD-19 pandemic (De Caro et al.,
2020,). Infections with other coronaviruses are indeed recognized as a cause of liver and lung disease
(Mihindukulasuriya et al., 2008), while gammacoronaviruses were retrieved from fecal samples of
three Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) (Woo et al., 2014) (Zappulli et al., 2020).
Since many cetacean species are social, such as Tursiops truncatus (bottlenose dolphin) and Stenella
coeruleoalba (striped dolphin), their high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 suggests that their
populations could be especially vulnerable to intra-species transmission of this novel coronavirus.
Among the species with a high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the common bottlenose
dolphin could result the most impacted cetacean, given its distribution along the continental shelf and
along the entire Italian coastline. Moreover, the behaviour and the size of the pods of the species
could play an important role in the spread of the virus among the specimens in the pod; both striped
and common bottlenose dolphins are gregarious species and this ecological feature may facilitate the

Along all the Italian coasts, the most common species is T. truncatus (Reeves & Notarbartolo, 2006);
the species is the only regular for the Northern Adriatic Sea (Bearzi et al., 2004) and then distributed
in the Ligurian Sea, the whole Tyrrhenian Sea (Lauriano et al., 2015; Gnone et al., 2011), the Sicily
Strait, and the Ionian Sea. Since T. truncatus is an “inshore” species, the risk of acquiring SARSCoV-2 infection, which like many others is characterized by a “land-to-sea” transmission ecoepidemiological pathway, appears to be greater than for “offshore” species. This would candidate

mammals.

S. coeruleoalba, the most abundant species in the Mediterranean Sea (Aguilar, 2000), displays an
offshore distribution (Notarbartolo di Sciara, 2016) and is then regular in the Southern Adriatic Sea,
Ionian Sea, including the Sicily Strait, all the Tyrrhenian Sea, and the Ligurian Sea along with B.
physalus (Panigada et al., 2017). The fin whale distribution ranges from north to south feeding
grounds in summer and winter, respectively, as it has been described by satellite telemetry (Panigada
et al., 2017) and boat-based observations (Canese et al., 2006).
Even if a decline in the population of D. delphis, has been reported for the Mediterranean Sea (Bearzi
et al., 2003), the species is still regularly observed in the Tyrrhenian Sea.
Infection susceptibility can hinder the conservation status of the species; indeed, the fin whale is listed
as Vulnerable in the IUCN (Mediterranean and Italian range), since a population abundance decline
has been inferred in the last years. The decline is a major concern for the Mediterranean sub
population (Panigada et al., 2017); hence epidemic disease, as already documented for morbilliviral
infection (Mazzariol et al., 2016), would represent a plague. A worst situation would be expected for
the Critically Endangered killer whale, given the extremely low number of individuals left in the
subpopulation confined in the Gibraltar Strait (Esteban and Foote, 2019). Even if the analysis for the
sperm whale revealed a medium susceptibility, the low number of individuals within the population
and the Endangered IUCN Mediterranean and Italian status, foresee a high-risk degree for such
species.

Conclusion and future directions
By highlighting the vulnerability of marine mammals to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the scientific
community hopes to shape policy decisions regarding wastewater management around the world, in
order to help protect at-risk marine mammal species that may be exposed to this coronavirus.

Regarding Italian situation, additional measures of treating the wastewater in those areas where they
are insufficient or inadequate (Ligurian Sea, Central Adriatic Sea, South-Eastern Tyrrhenian Sea,
Northern and Southern Ionian Sea and Sicilian Channel) would help protect the species and reduce
the probability of them being exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
In summary, there is an urgent need to increase SARS-CoV-2 infection’s surveillance in free-ranging
cetaceans and also to screen stranded specimens for such infection, particularly in cases of mass
stranding or unusual behaviour.
Further studies are needed in cetaceans to provide a more in-depth insight into SARS-CoV-2
susceptibility, also in relation to the escalating levels of anthropogenic stressors to which they are
exposed.
Considering the economic costs of the present pandemic, greater efforts to improve wastewater
treatment, specifically with the removal or inactivation of viral contaminants on a global scale, should
be regarded as a priority.
This is made even more urgent by the new SARS-CoV-2 variants which have emerged in the United
Kingdom as well as in Brazil and South Africa, with the S protein’s mutations carried by them leading
to greater viral transmission/transmissibility rates and, possibly, also to increased pathogenicity.
These variants, which are rapidly spreading around the world, have also been isolated and sequenced
on the Italian territory; in this respect, viral genome sequencing from wastewater can detect new
SARS-CoV-2 variants before they are detected in infected patients. Consequently, analysing sewage
and run-off waters can help detect and track the spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants posing a risk
to human health and, potentially, also to the health and conservation status of wild animal species and
populations, including sea mammals.

Evaluation of the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 of the different species of marine mammals

in Mediterranean Sea through comparative ACE-2 receptor analysis
ACE-2 protein sequences in marine mammals’ analysis
We analysed the ACE-2 receptor of the marine mammal species residing in the Mediterranean by
means of available genomes on NCBI database. A list of ACE-2 orthologs from Cetacea was
downloaded

from

the

NCBI

website

(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/59272/ortholog/?scope=7742). ACE-2 coding DNA sequences
were extracted from available or recently sequenced genome assemblies, with the help of genome
alignment tool (BLAST) and the translated protein sequences were checked against human or within
family ACE-2 orthologs.

Species distribution along the Italian coastline
Several sources on cetacean species occurrence and distribution are available for the Mediterranean
Sea and for the seas around the Italian peninsula; nonetheless, keeping in mind the aims of this work,
we decided to refer to the official updated synthesis available in the IV Reporting of the Habitat
Directive (Lauriano, 2019) (Table 1).
Species distribution and range maps were created using a standard 10x10 km ETRS89 grid (projection
ETRS

LAEA

5210)

and

a

specifically

designed

“range

tool”

(http://discomap.eea.europa.eu/App/RangeTool/).

Assessment of species susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection
Of the species listed in Table 1, we examined marine mammal species that encompassed all publicly
available reference and scaffold genomes.
For species lacking genome sequences, ACE-2 primers were designed by identifying conserved
regions from a multiple alignment of cetacean ACE-2 mRNA sequences (Table 4).

Moreover, for species in which the genome sequence was lacking, we decided to determine
experimentally the ACE-2 receptor sequence, based on species distribution and samples’ availability.
Since striped dolphin represents the most common cetacean in the Mediterranean Sea and considering
the samples availability in the “Centro di Referenza Nazionale per le Indagini Diagnostiche sui
Mammiferi Marini Spiaggiati” (C.Re.Di.Ma.) tissue bank, we proceeded with the analyses on this
species.

Molecular analyses (PCR and Sequencing)
Striped dolphin brain and lung samples were submitted to total RNA extraction using the TissueLyser
II (QI-AGEN) and highspeed shaking in Eppendorf tubes with stainless steel beads (5 mm diameter,
QIAGEN). Homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 3 min to remove tissue debris.
Supernatants were used for RNA extraction by AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was eluted in a final volume of 100 μl of elution buffer and
stored at −80 °C until analyzed.
Total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Thermo Fisher) according the manufacturer’s protocol.
ACE-2 primers were designed using Primer3 software from a multiple alignment of cetacean ACE-2
mRNA sequences. ACE-2 conserved regions were identified flanking the nucleotide triplets of
interest. Two primer pairs were designed amplifying two ACE-2 gene fragments (Table 4).
The reaction system used for PCR amplification was 50 μL, consisting of ACE2 primers 2,50 μL, 1X
Buffer 2,50 μL, MgCl2 2 μL, dNTPs 0,50 μL, AmpliTaq Gold 0,20 μL, cDNA 2,50 μL, H2O 12,30
μL.
The reaction was performed with the following PCR conditions: 5 min at 95 °C; 40/48 cycles of 30
s at 94°C, 30 s at 55 °C,30 s at 72 °C; 7 min at 72 °C.

The amplification products were analyzed by electrophoresis, in a GelRed (Biotium) staining 2%
agarose gel, visualized under UV light transillumination (Gel-Doc UV transilluminator system BioRad) and then identified by their molecular weights.
Amplicons were purified using the NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel) and
submitted to cycle-sequencing reaction by BigDye Terminator v.3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Ther-mo
Fisher). Dye-labelled amplicons were purified using the BigDye XTerminator Purification kit
(Thermo Fisher) and capillary electrophoresis was performed on a ABI 3130 XL Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems).
Sequences were manually inspected using the Sequencing Analysis v. 5.2 software. A dataset in .fasta
format was created using the newly generated sequences and ACE-2 homologue sequences available
in GenBank. The dataset was aligned using BioEdit v7.2.5 software for identification of the ACE-2
amino acid residues of interest.
Assessment of species susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection
We used the set of rules developed by Damas et al. 2020 for predicting the likehood of SARS-CoV2 S protein binding to cetacean ACE-2.
This study identified the ACE-2 amino acid residues involved in binding to SARS-CoV-2 S protein
that were previously reported to be critical for the effective binding of ACE-2 to SARS-CoV-2 S
protein’s RBD. These residues include S19, Q24, T27, F28, D30, K31, H34, E35, E37, D38, Y41,
Q42, L45, L79, M82, Y83, N330, K353, G354, D355, R357, and R393. The known human ACE-2
RBD glycosylation sites N53, N90, and N322 were also included in the analysed amino acid residue
set.
Regions of the human ACE-2 protein sequence interacting with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein were
highlighted and compared with the amino acid composition of protein sequences of marine mammals
selected for the study (Table 2).
Species were classified in one of five categories: very high, high, medium, low, or very low
susceptibility.

Cross-referencing of conservation status and susceptibility
We cross-referenced the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red list of
Threatened Species (https://www.iucnredlist.org; accessed July 31, 2020) to better understand which
at risk species could be also susceptible to the virus. For each species, we looked at the Global,
Mediterranean and Italian (Fortuna et al, 2013) assessment, in order to determine their IUCN Red
List Category. The Mediterranean IUCN status is under review (Table 5).

Geo-mapping of Italian wastewater plants, stretches of coast and species at risk

To identify high-risk areas for SARS-CoV-2 viral spillover in Italy, we overlaid geo-mapping data of
Italian wastewater plants with local marine mammal population data.
In order to assess the potential viral infection level of water bodies entering the sea, we firstly
considered quality sewage treatment procedures and location of the Italian wastewater plants.
Subsequently, we took into account the coastal areas more frequently exposed to effect of global
warming (e.g. heavy rainfalls, storms, and floods) and consequently at high risk of flush untreated or
not efficiently treated sewage into rivers and coastal water.
For the first purpose, we referred to the European Environmental Agency thematic page
(https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/water/european-waters/water-use-and-environmentalpressures/uwwtd), focusing on our Country. We used the urban wastewater treatment map based on
provisional data on the implementation of the Urban WasteWater Treatment Directive (UWWTD) in
EU Countries from 2018, which were reported by the concerned Countries in 2020.
To search for data on wastewater plants with poor quality sewage treatment procedures, we
considered both the urban wastewater treatment pathways in big cities (agglomerations ≥ 150 000
population equivalent (p.e.) and the urban wastewater treatment plants from agglomerations ≥ 2000
p.e.

Regarding the type of treatment, in both cases we focused on primary and secondary treatment plants,
which give no guarantees of virus inactivation, to locate first level risk areas.
In order to identify risk areas at a higher level of detail, we focused on treatment plants (reported for
agglomerations ≥ 2.000 p.e.) with more stringent treatments (e.g. disinfection, sand filtration and
other), selecting the location of plants that apply a type of sanitation other than disinfection (by
chlorination or UV or ozonisation).
For the cartographic return/mapping, to build the first layer, we considered the sites most at risk
overall.
To identify the coastal areas more involved in extreme weather events, we referred to the 2018 edition
of the report prepared by the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA)
https://www.isprambiente.gov.it/files2018/pubblicazioni/rapporti/rapporto-dissesto
idrogeologico/Rapporto_Dissesto_Idrogeologico_ISPRA_287_2018_Web.pdf),

providing

an

updated overview on landslide and flood hazards throughout the Country.
The distribution maps were overlaid with data of the wastewater treatment plants and on the coastal
areas potentially more involved in extreme weather events.
Using this approach, we were able to determine each geographic area and surrondings, where
wastewater effluents and overflows may pose marine mammals at risk from anthropogenic SARSCoV-2 transmission.

Immunohistochemistry

Previous studies on SARS-CoV-2 have shown that ACE-2 is the receptor through which the virus
enters cells. In order to understand the patterns of ACE-2 protein expression in the lung tissue and if
this is relevant to the possibility of acquiring and developing SARS-CoV-2 infection by cetaceans,
we carried out ad hoc IHC investigations on different species of cetaceans (Table XX), based on
pulmonary tissue samples’

availability at the Mediterranean Marine Mammal Tissue Bank

(MMMTB) of the University of Padua (Legnaro, Padua, Italy). IHC staining for ACE-2 was
performed as outlined here below.
In order to evaluate the IR patterns of ACE-2, lung tissue sections from different species of cetaceans,
previously formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded, were sectioned and hydrated through xylenes;
endogenous peroxidase was blocked using a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. Heat-induced antigen
retrieval was performed using citrate buffer bath (PH 6.1) at 97° C for 15 min. After cooling to room
temperature, sections were incubated with blocking serum (VECTASTAIN ABC Kit, pk-4001) for
20 min before being incubated overnight with the primary anti-ACE-2 antibody (a polyclonal
antibody raised in rabbits and diluted 1:2000, ab15348 Abcam) at 4°C in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS)
containing Tween. The next day, after washing with TBS buffer, sections were first incubated with
the secondary antibody for 30 min, then with prepared VECTASTAIN ABC Reagent; subsequently,
the final detection was carried out with Diaminobenzidine (DAB, Dako K3468) as chromogen for 5
minutes. Sections were then counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin for a better visualization of
tissue morphology. Adequate positive and blank control tissues were utilized in each run.
