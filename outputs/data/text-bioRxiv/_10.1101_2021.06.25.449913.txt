Abstract
In the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, drug repurposing was widely used to identify compounds
that could improve the prognosis of symptomatic patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. Hydroxychloroquine
(HCQ) was one of the first drugs used to treat COVID-19 patients due to its supposed capacity of inhibiting
SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in vitro.
While its efficacy is debated, HCQ has been associated with QT interval prolongation and potentially
Torsades de Pointes, especially in patients predisposed to developing drug-induced Long QT Syndrome
(LQTS) as silent carriers of variants associated with congenital LQTS. If confirmed, these effects represent
a limitation to the at-home use of HCQ for COVID-19 infection as adequate ECG monitoring may be
challenging.
We investigated the proarrhythmic profile of HCQ with Multi-Electrode Arrays after subchronic exposure of
human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from two healthy donors, one
asymptomatic and two symptomatic LQTS patients.
We demonstrate that: I) HCQ induced a concentration-dependent Field Potential Duration (FPD)
prolongation in vitro and triggered arrhythmias that halted the beating at high concentration. II) hiPSC-CMs
from healthy or asymptomatic carriers tolerated higher concentrations of HCQ and showed lower
susceptibility to HCQ-induced electrical abnormalities regardless of baseline FPD values. These findings
agree with the clinical safety records of HCQ and demonstrated that hiPSC-CMs potentially discriminates
symptomatic vs asymptomatic mutation carriers through pharmacological interventions. Disease-specific
cohorts of hiPSC-CMs may be a valid preliminary addition to quickly assess drug safety in vulnerable
populations, offering rapid preclinical results with valuable translational relevance for precision medicine.

Introduction
Drug repurposing is a key strategy aimed to identify new applications for compounds that have already
been approved by regulatory authorities. The known safety profiles and toxicology of the repurposed
compounds reduce the chances of failure and drug attrition, shorten the time frame for drug development
and lower the costs associated with drug discovery and screening (Pushpakom et al., 2019). It had been a
key process during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic to promote the identification of marketed
compounds that could improve prognosis and therapy for symptomatic patients infected by the severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an antimalarial drug successfully used for the treatment of systemic lupus
erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, was identified as a compound capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2
infection and replication in vitro (Liu et al., 2020; Touret et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2020); its off-label use was
thus proposed for the treatment but also the prevention of COVID-19 in multiple clinical trials.
However, HCQ carries known pharmacological side-effects which include the block of the rapid
delayed-rectifier potassium current (IKr) and the inward delayed-rectifier potassium current (IK1) at
therapeutic concentrations, with peak sodium current (INa) and L-type calcium current (ICaL) blocked at
higher concentrations (Wang et al., 2020).
At the clinical level, HCQ prolongs the QT interval (Saleh et al., 2020), with effects particularly exacerbated
in the presence of factors such as plasma electrolyte imbalance (e.g. hypokalemia) and fever, both
frequently present in patients with COVID-19, or secondary organ dysfunction. For these reasons, HCQ is
classified by the CredibleMeds® database (Woosley et al.) as a drug with a known risk of causing Torsades
de Pointes (TdP) and which has to be avoided in patients with the congenital Long QT Syndrome (cLQTS)
(Schwartz and Ackerman, 2013). The proarrhythmic potential of HCQ seems further enhanced by its
administration in combination with Azhithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic also proposed for the treatment of
COVID-19 which can also cause TdPs (Mercuro et al., 2020; Fiolet et al., 2021).
Consequently, the administration of HCQ to a broad and heterogeneous population of patients, particularly
at dosages higher than those already approved or while being proposed as at-home therapy regardless of
any information on the patients’ genetic background (Procter et al., 2020), may create safety risks without
adequate QT monitoring (Derwand et al., 2020); the susceptibility to QT-prolonging drugs is indeed
exacerbated in case of silent cLQTS mutation carriers, i.e. patients carrying variant(s) in LQTS gene(s) who
do not have the clinical hallmarks of LQTS despite having a compromised repolarization reserve (O’Hara
and Rudy, 2012; Schwartz and Woosley, 2016). The potential proarrhythmic effect of HCQ has highlighted
the complications of assessing the safety of pharmacological therapies, particularly on how to predict and
quantify the risks of drugs used at doses not previously tested. A strategy to identify patients at risk of
developing drug-induced QT prolongation and arrhythmias is still lacking, but there is a strong need for
valid models which reproduce or predict the genotype-specific consequences of drugs on silent cLQTS
mutation carriers; this would be particularly relevant for individuals with borderline QT intervals whose
pathogenic variants often go undiagnosed in routine ECGs but which may significantly increase the
arrhythmogenic susceptibility to QT prolonging drugs. This also applies for individuals carrying variants in
protective/detrimental genetic modifiers (Itoh et al., 2016; Chai et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2021).
Despite the promising in vitro results, HCQ did not confirm its efficacy in vivo neither in preventing
SARS-CoV-2 infection nor in treating the severe consequences of the infection, with findings confirmed by
several independent studies (Graham et al., 2020; Axfors et al., 2021; Jorge, 2021; Macías et al., 2021;
Rentsch et al., 2021; WHO Solidarity Trial Consortium et al., 2021). Conclusive evidence of its efficacy will
come as several clinical trials are still recruiting (272 studies, 88 recruiting or enrolling by invitation; 24
Active, not recruiting; 9 suspended, 23 terminated; 62 completed; 28 withdrawn ClinicalTrials.gov, accessed
on 14/04/2021). We believe that more information is required to understand the risks and boundaries of
HCQ when administered in a potentially susceptible population of patients in which asymptomatic
individuals carry a higher predisposition for TdP.
Here we used MultiElectrode Arrays (MEAs), one of the platforms of choice from the Comprehensive In
vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA) consortium (Millard et al., 2018), to report the consequences of

subchronic exposure to different concentrations of HCQ in a heterogeneous subset of three LQTS subjects
and two unrelated healthy controls.
We aimed to assess whether: i) hiPSC-CMs can identify potential proarrhythmic effects by HCQ in vitro; ii)
a genotype-specific response to HCQ can be reproduced with hiPSC-CMs and whether it correlates with
clinical observations; and iii) hiPSC-CMs from homogeneous disease-specific cohorts could provide quick
preclinical readouts before repurposing drugs to patients in large trials.

Methods
hiPSCs culture and differentiation to hiPSC-CMs
Three patients affected by LQTS were studied. One carries the KCNQ1-p.R594Q variant (Mura et al.,
2018), associated with the most common form of LQTS (LQT1). One was affected by the Jervell and
Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS) carrying the KCNQ1-p.R594Q & KCNQ1-p.R190W variants in compound
heteozigosity (Mura et al., 2018); JLNS is one of the most severe forms of LQTS, caused by the presence
of homozygous or compound heterozygous variants on KCNQ1 or on KCNE1 associated to congenital
deafness in addition to the typical cardiac features (Schwartz et al., 2006). One was affected by the
CALM1-p.F142L variant (Crotti et al., 2013) associated with CALM-LQTS, which manifests in infants, is
extremely severe, and responds poorly to therapy (Rocchetti et al., 2017; Crotti et al., 2019).
hiPSCs from healthy subjects: one was an unrelated bona fide healthy donor (WT (Lee et al., 2021) while
hiPSCs from the second donor (WT2) were provided by the Coriell Institute for Medical Research (WTC-11
line, catalog No. GM25256).
hiPSCs were cultured on recombinant human vitronectin (rhVTN) in E8 Flex medium and differentiated on
cell culture-grade Matrigel. hiPSCs were differentiated to hiPSC-CMs following a protocol based on the
modulation of the Wnt-signalling pathway (Lian et al., 2012), purified through glucose starvation (> 90%
CMs) and cryopreserved at days 17-20. Cryopreserved hiPSC-CMs were thawed before each experiment
and maintained in culture for 7 days in RPMI medium supplemented with B27 Supplement (RPMI+B27).
Data were obtained from 3 independent differentiations for each line. Details on reagents are provided in
Table S1.
MultiElectrode Array
Multiwell MEAs (MultiChannel Systems) were coated with 40 µg/mL bovine fibronectin and processed as
previously described (Sala et al., 2017b). hiPSC-CMs were dissociated with TrypLE Select and replated on
Multiwell MEAs as confluent monolayers. RPMI+B27 was refreshed every 48-72 hours. The recordings
started after one week and were made at Baseline and at 2h, 24h and 48h after the treatment with HCQ
(Figure 1).
Drug preparation and testing
HCQ was dissolved in water to obtain a stock solution of 50 mM. After having recorded Field Potentials
(FP) values at Baseline, RPMI+B27 in Multiwell MEAs was refreshed with working concentrations of HCQ
prepared in RPMI+B27 (1 µM, 10 µM, 100 µM). Vehicle was balanced accordingly and used as a control in
each experiment and each Multiwell MEA plate.
Field Potential Scoring System
A 6-point FP scoring system was implemented to evaluate the quality of FPs and to classify potential
detrimental effects of the drug treatment on FP quality (Figure 3B).
Score 5: assigned to FPs with both markedly pronounced positive and negative upstrokes, a unambguous
repolarization wave and a large FP amplitude; noise and signal oscillations at baseline must not be present
and the RR interval must be regular.
Score 4: assigned to FPs with either a clear positive or negative depolarization peak, a visible repolarization
wave and a large FP amplitude; noise and signal oscillations at baseline must not be present and the RR
interval must be regular.

Score 3: assigned to FPs similar to the previous condition but with a smaller FP amplitude, a less markedly
pronounced repolarization peak and a potentially ambiguous repolarization peak. Signal oscillations at
baseline can be present and RR must be stable.
Score 2: assigned to FPs characterized by a small positive or negative depolarization, a small FP
amplitude, a small and potentially ambiguous repolarization peak. Signal oscillations at baseline can be
present and RR interval can be irregular.
Score 1: assigned to FPs characterized by a very irregular pattern(s), with small/absent depolarization and
a small/absent repolarization peak; noise is present in terms of oscillations at baseline and electrical
interference from neighboring electrodes, RR interval can be unstable.
Score 0: assigned to electrically inactive wells.
Data Analysis and Statistics
The analysis of FPs was performed as previously described (Sala et al., 2017b) and automated through
custom R scripts (R v.4.0.4) to accommodate a large number of data points. In total, data from 1320
individual MEA recordings were analyzed.
Comparisons of FPD, RR, cFPD were performed for each line with Dunnett’s test using Baseline as
reference values. Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05 and is indicated in text and figures with an
asterisk. Data are presented in the text as mean, mean ± standard error of the mean (sem) and scatter
points where relevant.
To exclude any potential bias carried by the endogenous FPD of healthy hiPSC lines, we chose two healthy
hiPSC lines characterized by different baseline FPD. Baseline FPD is a reliable parameter for comparisons
only in case of isogenic lines or at least in case of lines sharing part of the genetic background (i.e. from
relatives, as in case of LQT1 and JLNS lines in this paper) while it might often provide misleading results in
case of cross-line comparisons (Sala et al., 2016, 2017a).

Results
Baseline data
Given the significant non-zero slope of the FPD-RR linear fit for the majority of the lines, data were
corrected with the clinically-used Bazett’s QT correction formula, validated across all ages
(Stramba-Badiale et al., 2018). Corrected FPDs (cFPD) nullified the positive correlation with RR where
present (Figure 1B, C), normalizing the rate-dependency of FPD.
Signs of spontaneous arrhythmias and electrical instability were detected at baseline in MEAs from the
JLNS and CALM-LQTS (Figure S2).
Effect of HCQ on electrical activity and FP quality
We first investigated the presence of potential detrimental effects of the exposure to HCQ on the
spontaneous activity of hiPSC-CMs monolayers.
We observed a dose-dependent effect of HCQ quantified as an increasing number of wells that ceased to
beat with higher concentrations (Figure 2, Figure 3A). Here, a genotype-dependent effect was observed
and it became particularly evident in two conditions: after the acute (2h) exposure to 10 µM HCQ,
hiPSC-CMs from the two controls showed no effect on the spontaneous beating while ~20% of the
monolayers from the LQT1, ~35% of the JLNS and ~ 50% of the monolayers from the very severe
CALM-LQTS temporarily halted the beating, which only partially recovered at longer timepoints (Figure 2).
Similarly, 100 µM HCQ induced a larger termination of the spontaneous beating in monolayers from JLNS
and CALM-LQTS, while asymptomatic LQT1 and the two WT seems more resistant to higher
concentrations of HCQ (Figure 2 and 3A).
Next, we developed a 6-point scoring system to incorporate information regarding the FP quality
degradation due to HCQ into the classification of the drug effect. This is particularly relevant to provide
differential weights to MEAs in which the main temporal FP parameters (i.e. FPD, RR, cFPD, etc) could still
be tracked and quantified but were spoiled by the drug treatment. We observed that HCQ had more severe

effects on the FP quality of hiPSC-CMs from the two symptomatic subjects, with minor or modest effects in
hiPSC-CMs from the asymptomatic LQT1 and from the healthy controls. These differences could be
appreciated already at 1 µM and were particularly relevant at 10 µM. At 100 µM, only hiPSC-CMs from one
of the two healthy donors maintained a higher proportion of good FPs despite their FP shapes being
significantly modified.
Effect of HCQ on FPD, RR, cFPD
After having assessed the detrimental effects of HCQ on FP quality, we investigated the effect of different
concentrations of HCQ on MEA temporal parameters to verify whether HCQ could trigger a differential FPD
prolongation based on the donor’s genotype. Higher susceptibility to media changes has been observed in
the CALM-LQTS at all timepoints, even with vehicle, with spontaneous arrhythmic events often present
(Figure S2). Treatment with vehicle induced changes (shortening) in the cFPD of WT at 2h, while it
prolonged cFPD in CALM-LQTS at all the timepoints.
HCQ 1 µM induced prolongation in the cFPD of CALM-LQTS at all the timepoints and increased the
number of MEAs without electrical activity.
HCQ 10 µM induced shortening in the cFPD of WT only at 2h, while it significantly increased cFPD in WT2,
LQT1, JLNS and CALM-LQTS at all the time points and was paired with a cessation of beating only
affecting LQT1, JLNS and CALM-LQTS.
HCQ 100 µM induced cFPD prolongation in WT, WT2, LQT1 while monolayers from JLNS and
CALM-LQTS did not tolerate such high dosage and no electrical activity was observed at all timepoints.

Discussion
Our findings provide novel evidence that hiPSC-CMs from subjects with a different propensity toward
life-threatening arrhythmias, largely driven by their genetic background, may respond differently to drugs
with the potential of blocking repolarizing currents. As drug screening moves progressively toward more
sophisticated approaches, not unmindful of precision medicine, the incorporation of disease-specific
cohorts of hiPSC-CMs should be considered as rational step in the assessment of drug repurposing
strategies in vulnerable populations and possibly also in the safety screening of new drugs.
Comparisons of concentrations between in vitro and in vivo
Although the concentrations and the modality of administration (acute vs cumulative) are different among in
vitro experiments and many clinical trials, results for the WT subjects were similar to results from early
timepoints published by other investigators with MEAs (TeBay et al., 2021) or in a more sophisticated
organ-on-a-chip system (Charrez et al., 2021). Our study further extends these results including a
susceptible population of patients affected by cLQTS that may be at higher risk of exhibiting diLQTS and
developing TdP. The mean HCQ plasma concentration in subjects treated with HCQ has been measured as
50.3 ng/mL following a single 200 mg dose of HCQ (Plaquenil®) and a mean peak blood concentration of
129.6 ng/mL (Plaquenil label indication); based on these data, it is reasonable to estimate an in vitro
concentration of 0.15 µM - 0.387 µM.
Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro was achieved at concentrations larger than 4 µM (EC50 4.06 µM
or higher) regardless of the multiplicity of infection (MOI) used for SARS-CoV-2, (Liu et al., 2020), while the
cytotoxic concentration (CC50) in ATCC-1586 cells was around 250 µM. Other studies identified a similar
range of concentrations in Vero/VeroE6 cells, with an EC50 of ~6 µM after 24h of treatment (Yao et al.,
2020) or an IC50 of 2-4 µM at 48h or 72h respectively (Maisonnasse et al., 2020).
In the RECOVERY trial, patients were treated with 800 mg administered at zero and 6 hours, followed by
400 mg starting at 12 hours after the initial dose and subsequently every 12 hours for the following 9 days
or until discharge (RECOVERY Collaborative Group et al., 2020). The simulated whole-blood
concentration-time plots derived the theoretical whole-blood concentration of HCQ to span from 1 µM to 6
µM, with an upper safety bound for whole-blood of ~10 µM (3 µM at plasma concentration) (White et al.,
2020).

The concentrations used in this study appropriately covered clinically relevant concentrations as well as the
in vitro effective dosages for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition, but also take into consideration a potential higher
tolerance to drugs by hiPSC-CMs and the unknown effect of serum-free cell culture media on HCQ
bioavailability.
hiPSC-CMs can identify potential proarrhythmic effects of HCQ in vitro
Concentration-dependent effects were recorded for HCQ in all the lines, with the main modifications being
changes in the repolarization peak as well as in the FP amplitude and quality. We could detect indications
of proarrhythmic events in many of the MEAs treated with high HCQ concentrations, with the main events
being abnormal shape of the repolarization wave, an irregular beat rate, a variable amplitude and presence
of multiple depolarization peaks among consecutive beats. Some of these features were already visible at
baseline for hiPSC-CMs from the two most severe lines used in this study (i.e. JLNS, CALM-LQTS).
A genotype-specific response to HCQ can be reproduced with hiPSC-CMs and it correlates with the
clinical severity of LQTS
A genotype-specific drug response pattern could also be identified and it aligned with the severity of the
underlying genotypes. Our data indicate that hiPSC-CMs from the healthy donors or the asymptomatic
LQT1 mutation carrier tolerated higher concentrations of HCQ and showed lower susceptibility to HCQ
regardless of baseline in vitro FPD values.
Importantly and in agreement with previous observations (Sala et al., 2016, 2017a), the genotype-specific
effects were present and predominant over the different baseline FPD parameters, further confirming that
absolute FPD (or APD) values alone might provide misleading information when classifying drug effects in
different cell lines, with the relative drug effects and a more comprehensive analysis of all FP parameters to
take into account the underlying genotypes may provide more relevant results.
Healthy controls showed a higher tolerance for QTc prolongation and higher resistance to high HCQ
concentrations. The asymptomatic LQT1 carrier (Female, Basal QTc = 458 ms) was identified in our centre
only through a family screening of the sibling (JLNS, Female, Basal QTc = 578 ms, symptomatic) and might
have been included in one of the COVID-19 clinical trials with HCQ because in most of them the exclusion
criteria for QTc were a cutoff of 480 ms. This would have meant a significantly higher chance for a
degradation of the electrical signal (Figure 3C) or for pathological FPD prolongation (Figure 4).
Similarly to Chloroquine (Sánchez-Chapula et al., 2001), also HCQ blocks IK1, and this could explain the
increased beating frequency observed particularly in hiPSC-CMs from WT despite HCQ should inhibit also
the funny current (If) (Capel et al., 2015); in our experimental settings, this effect did not clearly emerge in
hiPSC-CMs from LQTS subjects; however, a drug-induced IK1 blockade may generate an additive effect on
the underlying LQTS, especially on spontaneously beating cells, with the effect on the beating frequency
potentially being masked by an additive and abnormal FPD prolongation due to an already compromized
repolarization reserve.
hiPSC-CMs offer rapid preclinical results with valuable translational relevance for precision
medicine
Drug discovery and drug approval pipelines are already designed to prevent or minimize compounds that
show a proarrhythmic potential due to a hERG blocking activity to be approved and commercialized
(International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use,
2005). Even though important results have been achieved in the predictive potential of in vitro and in silico
systems (Blinova et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017; Passini et al., 2017), comprehensive experimental models
capable of recapitulating the complexity of human physiology are lacking and thus several compounds were
withdrawn from the market after their approval (e.g. cisapride (Henney, 2000), astemizole (Gottlieb, 1999),
terfenadine (Fung et al., 2001), etc), with cardiovascular toxicity still being a major cause for molecules to
be discarded in the preclinical phases of drug development (Ferri et al., 2013). Platforms to guide clinical
decision making and orient research efforts are required, particularly in critical situations when there is a
compelling need for repurposed compounds or when therapies are being recommended for home use. In

recent years, the use of hiPSC-CMs for safety pharmacology has progressively gained momentum and
multiple validation strategies have been attempted to generate experimental models with enhanced
predictive potential, and recently the CiPA approach or similar strategies have been used to evaluate the
proarrhythmic risk of HCQ on hiPSC-CMs from commercial hiPSC lines or healthy individuals (Delaunois et
al., 2021). Platforms based on hiPSCs can offer rapid and relevant readouts for safety pharmacology (Sala
et al., 2017a) but the possibility of incorporating patient-specific drug responses in addition to those from
healthy individuals can increase the predictive capacity of these platforms in conditions where prompt
actions are required.

Limitations of the study
Despite the remarkable progress in the strategies to mature hiPSC-CMs (Kamakura et al., 2013; Parikh et
al., 2017; Feyen et al., 2020; Fukushima et al., 2020; Giacomelli et al., 2020), their electrophysiological
phenotype still does not resemble that of adult cardiomyocytes and the relative ion channel distribution and
drug responses might reflect this partial maturation; we anticipate that baseline phenotypes as well as raw
dose-response curves might potentially differ in case other differentiation, purification or maturation
strategies are used. Nevertheless, given the early expression of the main ion channel targeted by HCQ (i.e.
Kv11.1), we expect the effects to be reproduced in other experimental settings; this work is in agreement
with the longstanding clinical safety profile of HCQ in healthy individuals and also allowed solid
drug-mediated discrimination of the underlying genotypes.
The intrinsic technical aspects of MEAs do not allow the comparison of absolute FP voltages as it would
have been possible in single cells with patch clamp; this cost is repaid in terms of throughput. However, we
cannot assume that the monolayers of hiPSC-CMs tested here, despite being constituted by purified
populations, exhibited comparable resting membrane potentials and, thus, drug effects may be influenced
by the inherent baseline electrophysiological properties of each line. This study provides information on the
short-term (≤48h) arrhythmogenic potential of HCQ and this timeframe was sufficient to discriminate
genotype-specific responses; this study does not provide information on cumulative effects caused by
repetitive doses or long-term treatments.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated that HCQ can induce cFPD prolongation, with effects becoming particularly
important in susceptible subjects, at concentrations similar to those used in COVID-19 trials. More modest
or negligible effects are instead evoked in hiPSC-CMs from healthy donors, particularly at concentrations
close to those used to treat rheumatic disease; this was consistent with data from clinical studies (Abella et
al., 2021).
Despite the highly controversial and debated (lack of) effectiveness for the prevention or treatment of
COVID-19 (Axfors et al., 2021), the use of HCQ in a population of healthy individuals should not be
stigmatized, as this compound has been successfully used for decades for the treatment of malaria,
systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis with more benefits than harm for patients (Wallace
et al., 2012; Pareek et al., 2020), without significant increases in TdP risk at standard concentrations used
in rheumatology (Taylor and White, 2004) and mainly only in association with co-prescribed QT-prolonging
drugs and very high HCQ dosages (causal association) (Saint-Gerons and Tabarés-Seisdedos, 2021). Our
report confirms this evidence.
Conversely, caution should be used for subjects who may be particularly susceptible to QT prolongation,
and a particular focus should be put on silent or asymptomatic carriers of cLQTS variants and especially
when genotype is additive to other detrimental pathophysiological factors or prescribed medications, as
frequently occurs in patients with COVID-19 infection. Indeed, in a worldwide survey of COVID-19
associated arrhythmias, with almost 60% of the patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and 50% with
azithromycin, those who developed cardiac arrhythmias already had borderline-prolonged QTc at the time
of hospital admission and were more frequently affected by comorbidities and by severe pulmonary
impairment (40% were mechanically ventilated) (Coromilas et al., 2021). On this issue, recommendations to

further minimize risks of QT prolongation with Chloroquine or with HCQ in susceptible subjects have been
recently drafted (Giudicessi et al., 2020; Offerhaus et al., 2020).
This work confirms that disease-specific hiPSC-CMs may provide additional information to drug screenings
performed solely on hiPSC lines from healthy donors and may thus represent a viable option for preclinical
drug repurposing screenings aiming for a higher translational readout. Larger homogeneous cohorts of
hiPSC-CMs, with the ideal involvement of multiple facilities and including multiple disease-causing variants,
genetic backgrounds and clinical manifestations, may represent a solid preliminary validation to assess the
proarrhythmic effect of drugs, particularly in situations requiring rapid decisions. The combination of
gene-editing and robust commercial iPSC lines from industry may further contribute to enhance and refine
this aspect.
However, the most critical task remains the identification of who might be a susceptible subject and how a
patient or a disease-cohort might respond to a new or repurposed therapy, and in this regard the
contribution provided by subject-specific hiPSC-CMs combined with genome sequencing and in silico
predictive approaches can provide insights with clinical implications for precision medicine (Gnecchi et al.,
2021).
