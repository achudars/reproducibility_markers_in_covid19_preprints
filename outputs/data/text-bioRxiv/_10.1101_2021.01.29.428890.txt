ABSTRACT

35

Recombinant production of viral proteins can be used to produce vaccine antigens or reagents to

36

identify antibodies in patient serum. Minimally, these proteins must be correctly folded and have

37

appropriate post-translation modifications. Here we report the production of the SARS-CoV-2

38

spike protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in the green algae Chlamydomonas. RBD fused

39

to a fluorescent reporter protein accumulates as an intact protein when targeted for ER-Golgi

40

retention or secreted from the cell, while a chloroplast localized version is truncated, lacking the

41

amino terminus. The ER-retained RBD fusion protein was able to bind the human ACE2

42

receptor, the host target of SARS-CoV-2, and was specifically out-competed by mammalian cell-

43

produced recombinant RBD, suggesting that the algae produced proteins are sufficiently post-

44

translationally modified to act as authentic SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Because algae can be grown

45

at large scale very inexpensively, this recombinant protein may be a low cost alternative to other

46

expression platforms.

INTRODUCTION

50

In late 2019 a novel coronavirus was identified in the Wuhan province of China with a

51

genome sequence closely resembling that of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)

52

coronavirus identified in 2003. Thus the novel coronavirus was named SARS-CoV-2. The

53

respiratory disease the virus causes has since been named COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease

54

2019). The virus quickly spread worldwide and was classified as a global pandemic in April of

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.29.428890; this version posted January 30, 2021. The copyright holder for this preprint

55

2020 (Cucinotta and Vanelli, 2020), and has continued to spread almost 1 year after its initial

56

identification.

57

Widespread use of nucleic acid tests that detect the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, such as RT-

58

qPCR have become the standard method to detect viral infection. However, laboratory assays

59

that measure antibody responses and determine seroconversion are not yet comparatively as

60

widely available. While such serological assays are not well suited to detect acute infections, and

61

indeed antibody production lags days behind symptoms and infectiousness, multiple relevant

62

applications exist for such antibody tests as they are one of the best indicators of prior immune

63

responses to viral antigens, and therefore might indicate individuals are immune (Carter et al.,

64

2020). In addition to use as a reagent to identify serum antibodies, recombinant spike protein can

65

also function as a vaccine antigen, and nearly all of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines being deployed

66

today are based on the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. As these vaccines are deployed at a

67

population scale, monitoring short- and long-term immune response to the vaccine target (the

68

SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein) will be a key component of characterizing vaccine efficacy, but

69

will also potentially provide information of when booster-doses of the vaccines might be

70

required, as immune responses can wane over time, while the virus is still known to be

71

circulating in the population. This may become especially important as practical adherence to

72

vaccination schedules established during clinical trials and “mix and match” use of different

73

vaccines becomes a practical reality. To develop such antibody tests, it is critical to produce the

74

viral protein antigens at extremely large scale and at an affordable price, so that antibody tests

75

can become available around the world, and not just in the economically advantaged countries.

76

The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates viral entry into host cells by first binding to the

77

host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor followed by fusion of the viral and host

78

membranes and release of the viral RNA into the host cell (Lan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2005). The

79

receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is located in the S1 subunit and directly

80

mediates the interaction with the ACE2 cell receptors (Lan et al., 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 RBD

81

is the protein primarily used in COVID-19 vaccines, and patients that have survived the infection

82

often have serum antibodies directed against this viral protein domain (Tai et al., 2020).

83

Antibody neutralization assays have also identified a strong correlation between high levels of

84

serum RBD specific binding antibodies and viral neutralization (Premkumar et al., 2020). Based

85

on this collective data, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD has become the antigen most used for serological

86

assays in addition to the antigenic target of multiple vaccines.

87

Production of useful SARS virus spike proteins and their subdomains has been a challenge

88

for non-animal cell production systems. Production of the 2003 SARS virus RBD or full spike

89

protein utilizing an E. coli-based system, showed poor protein folding and aggregation into

90

inclusion bodies. The resulting protein was much less immunogenic than the same protein

91

produced in mammalian or insect cells (Chen et al., 2005; Du et al., 2009). Production of corona

92

virus RBD proteins in fungal systems such as Pichia pastoris have demonstrated potential, but

93

the productivity tends to be orders of magnitude lower than what these yeast systems have been

94

shown to be capable of for other recombinant proteins (Chen et al., 2017, 2014).

95

Previous studies have shown success in plant-based systems for recombinant production of

96

viral recombinant proteins (Demurtas et al., 2016; He et al., 2014; Meyers et al., 2008). The

97

membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS were expressed transiently in Nicotiana

98

benthamiana, with the N protein demonstrating antibody recognition in convalescent serum

99

samples (Demurtas et al., 2016). The main drawback of plant-based expression systems is that

100

they have low biomass productivity compared to microbial systems, and have laborious and

101

technically demanding transformation methods that can require months to achieve

102

(Muthamilselvan et al., 2019).

103

Green microalgae can be grown photosynthetically or heterotrophically and can scale very

104

rapidly (Fields et al., 2018). Algae have been demonstrated to fold complex eukaryotic proteins

105

(Rasala et al., 2012, 2010), to be amenable to sophisticated molecular genetic tools (Sproles et

106

al., 2021), and to express recombinant proteins which can be directed to any subcellular

107

structures (Rasala et al., 2013). Collectively this allows for the rapid production of complex

108

proteins that can be grown at large scale in a cost effective manner (Rosales-Mendoza et al.,

109

2020).

110

Here we examined the potential of utilizing the unicellular green microalgae

111

Chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a production platform for recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD

112

protein. We tested three protein targeting strategies for recombinant protein production within C.

113

reinhardtii, by appending different intracellular localization motifs to the transgene. The RBD

114

proteins were targeted either to be retained in the Endoplasmic Reticulum-Golgi pathway,

115

secreted out of the cell into the culture media, or targeted for accumulation within the

116

chloroplast. We found that recombinant RBD targeted to the chloroplast accumulated to high

117

levels, but appeared to be truncated by ~6 kD at the amine end of the mature protein, and this

118

protein was not recognized by anti-RBD antibodies in western blotting assays. RBD proteins

119

targeted to the ER or secreted from the cell produced a protein of the expected size and correct

120

amino acid sequence. We purified spike RBD protein from the ER-Golgi retained version and

121

demonstrated that it specifically binds to recombinant ACE2 protein at a similar affinity as

122

mammalian expressed spike-RBD. These data demonstrate the potential of using eukaryotic

123

algae as an efficient and scalable platform to make correctly folded and functional spike-RBD

RESULTS

129

Design of SARS-Covid2 spike protein RBD expression cassette for recombinant protein

130

production in algae

131

Based on previous studies, as well as bioinformatics and structural modeling, we elected to

132

produce amino acids 319-537 of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein comprising the RBD (Wrapp et

133

al., 2020). For high throughput screening to rapidly identify recombinant protein production, we

134

fused this domain to the N-terminus of the green fluorescent protein derivative mClover (Lam et

135

al., 2012). The C. reinhardtii nuclear genome codon optimized fusion genes of the spike-RBD

136

and mClover were then placed in a modified expression vector based on components of the

137

previously published pBR9 and pOpt vectors (Rasala et al., 2013, Lauersen et al., 2015) (Figure

138

1 A). Expression was driven with the semi-synthetic AR1 promoter (Rasala et al., 2012). A 5’

139

Bleomycin resistance gene (ble) was included as part of the expression cistron to allow for

140

selection of high expressing clones on Zeocin containing media, while a foot and mouth disease

141

2A ribosomal-skip motif was placed between the ble coding region and the RBD::mClover

142

fusion protein, so that the RBD::mClover accumulated as a single fusion protein (Rasala et al.,

143

2012). A separate Hygromycin resistance gene driven by a beta-tubulin promoter was placed 3’

144

of the RBD transgene to allow for double selection, ensuring that the RB::mClover transgene is

145

intact in any transformant selected (Berthold et al., 2002).

147

Targeting of the RBD::mClover protein to subcellular compartments in transgenic algae

148

Since it is known that there are different protein folding and posttranslational modifications

149

made to proteins depending on which organelle a protein is directed to, we generated three

150

versions of the RBD::mClover construct; 1) A chloroplast directed version, produced by adding

151

the psaE chloroplast transit sequence to the N-terminus of the RBD fusion protein, 2) a secreted

152

version, produced by adding Pherophorin 2 (PHC2) signal peptide to the N-terminus of the RBD

153

fusion protein, and 3) a ER-Gogli retained version produced by the addition of a C-terminal

154

KDEL retention motif to the carboxy end of the RBD fusion protein containing the PHC2

155

secretion peptide (Figure 1 B).

156
157

Transformation and high throughput screening for recombinant protein production

158

The three vectors were linearized and transformed separately into algae via electroporation.

159

Following recovery on complete media, cells were selected on media containing both Zeocin and

160

Hygromycin. Ten days post-transformation, individual colonies were picked into 96-well

161

microtiter plates containing TAP media and grown for two days. The clones were then passaged

162

at a 1:4 dilution in to fresh TAP media for two days and fluorescence analysis, using a plate

163

reader, was used to identify strains with high mClover expression. The mClover fluorescence

164

signal was normalized to chlorophyll fluorescence and compared to both the CC124 starting

165

strain and a previously characterized GFP-expressing strain (Fields, 2019). Several hundred

166

mClover expressing transformants were recovered for both the secreted and ER retained clones,

167

from three independent transformations, while only a few dozen colonies were recovered from

168

the chloroplast targeted strains, despite the same amount of DNA being used in each of the

169

transformations. Similarly, by mClover fluorescence analysis, 10-30% of all secreted and ER

retained transformants showed fluorescence well above wild type, while only about 1-5% of the

192

Characterization of RBD::mClover localized to different compartments

193

When characterized by SDS-PAGE followed by Western Blotting using anti-GFP antibodies to

194

detect the mClover tag, we found cell pellets of the secreted and ER retained versions of the

195

RBD::mClover protein generated a band at the expected molecular weight of ~51 kDa (Figure

196

2). Similarly, ammonium sulfate precipitated protein from the media of the RBD::mClover

197

secreted construct had a detectable band at ~51 kDa. Of the few recoverable Chloroplast-directed

198

RBD::mClover transformants, all showed a smaller anti-GFP immunoreactive product at about

199

45 kDa, clearly smaller than the expected 51kDa product. Further characterization using anti-

200

SARS-CoV-2 RBD polyclonal antibodies to probe the western blots, revealed that while the

201

secreted and ER-Golgi retained proteins were detected as expected 51 kDa bands, the chloroplast

202

directed proteins at ~45 kDa were not detected, despite generating comparatively stronger anti-

203

GFP signal (Figure 2). It should be noted that a cross-reactive band at ~51kDa is observed in the

204

wild-type algae lysate when blots are probed with the anti-RBD Rabbit Polyclonal antibody from

205

Sino Biological. When equal amounts of protein were loaded, darker bands were observed in

206

lysates from the ER-Golgi retained and secreted RBD::mClover strains at the expected molecular

207

weight compared to either the wild type or Chloroplast directed strain (See Supplementary

208

Figure 1 for loading control verification using anti-AtpB).

209

The chloroplast localized RBD::mClover protein was then purified using anion exchange

210

chromatography followed by anti-GFP magnetic bead immunoprecipitation, and the partially

211

purified protein products were characterized using protein mass spectrometry analysis. The most

212

N-terminal peptide fragment detectable by mass spectroscopy in the chloroplast-directed

213

RBD::mClover corresponded to a protein product that would be 9 kDa smaller than the predicted

214

51 kDa full length mature protein, while a parallel experiment using the ER-Golgi retained

Purification and characterization of the RBD::mClover fusion proteins

236

To characterize the RBD protein produced using C. reinhardtii, we opted to purify the

237

RBD::mClover from the ER-retained version rather the secreted version, because we noticed that

238

the protein had similar molecular mass, suggesting similar post-translational modifications, and

239

because we noticed high molecular weight aggregates in the precipitated secreted proteins. Using

240

a variety of chromatography resins, we were able to purify sufficient amount of ER-retained

241

RBD::mClover to characterize the protein for receptor-interaction activity, and to identify that

242

total RBD::mClover protein was 0.1% of total soluble protein in total cell lysate and 2.6% of

243

total protein after this partial purification. We determined initial and partially purified final

244

recombinant protein yields of 31 µg/gram of wet biomass and 1.8 µg/gram of wet biomass,

245

respectively.

Functional characterization of algae-produced SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD protein

266

The SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD interacts with human host cells through ACE2 receptor binding

267

(Lan et al., 2020, p. 2; Tai et al., 2020; Wrapp et al., 2020). To determine if the algae-expressed

268

ER-retained RBD::mClover was correctly folded and functional, we established a human ACE2

269

receptor binding assay for SARS-CoV-2 RBD-containing proteins. HEK cell line expressed

270

biotinylated soluble human ACE2 receptor was immobilized on Strepavidin coated microtiter

271

plates and used as a substrate for SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding. To validate the assay we first

272

determined that that HEK cell expressed SARS-CoV-2 RBD C-terminally fused to rabbit IgG Fc

273

(RBD::rFc) could bind to the immobilized ACE2, and could identify that the recombinant RBD

274

bound the ACE2 protein at the EC50 of ~0.6ng/mL (Figure 4A). This affinity is within the nM

275

range previously reported (Liu et al., 2020) but 10-fold higher than the EC50 reported by the

276

manufacturer (2-6 ng/mL). Next we added a constant amount of our partially purified algae-

277

expressed RBD::mClover, and then titrated in the RBD::rFc as a competitor. Using anti-GFP

278

antibodies to detect RBD::mClover bound to the immobilized ACE2 receptor, we showed that

279

the RBD::rFc will compete RBD::mClover binding at an IC50 of ~1 µg/mL which is

280

approximately equal to the 2 µg/mL of the algae produced RBD::mClover loaded in to each well

281

(Figure 4). This suggests that the algae-produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD is functional in ACE2

282

binding, and appears to have a similar affinity as SARS-CoV-2 RBD produced in HEK cells, the

283

DISCUSSION

296

Here we have demonstrated that production of a correctly folded and functional SARS-CoV-2

297

spike protein Receptor Binding Domain is possible in the green alga C. reinhardtii. By fusing

298

the viral protein to a fluorescent mClover protein, we could use a high throughput fluorescent

299

screening strategy to rapidly identify strains of algae expressing sufficient quantities of SARS-

300

RBD to test protein accumulation and function. We showed that nuclear encoded transgenes,

301

directed to either the ER or secreted from the cell, produce a fusion protein of the expected size

302

that had the correct amino acid sequence, and that appeared to be correctly folded and post-

303

translationally modified, allowing the protein to function in ACE2 receptor binding. Protein

304

targeted to the chloroplast appeared to be truncated, likely by a chloroplast specific protease,

305

resulting in a protein that was not recognized by RBD polyclonal antibodies. Mass spectral

306

analysis suggests that the chloroplast truncated protein is the result of an N-terminal truncation in

307

the chloroplast-directed protein. Using partially purified ER localized algae SARS-CoV-2 RBD

308

to conduct ACE2 receptor binding interaction assays, we could demonstrated that the algae-

309

produced ER-retained version of RBD::mClover did indeed interact in a specific manner with its

310

cognate human host receptor, at a perceived affinity similar to mammalian expressed SARS-

311

CoV-2 RBD, suggesting that the folding and post translational modifications of the recombinant

312

algae RBD are sufficient to mediate appropriate RBD binding activity. Collectively these data

313

demonstrate the suitability of algae as a platform for the rapid production of recombinant

314

proteins that are correctly folded and post-translationally modified to create a functional protein.

315

Because algae can be grown at scale for a fraction of the cost of mammalian cell lines, this

316

system offers the potential to produce this recombinant viral protein, for a variety of uses

including as an antigen to detect serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 RBD or even as a

318

potential viral antigen for vaccine development, in a rapid and cost-effective manner.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

322

Strain and Culture conditions

323

Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strain CC124 was used throughout experiments. Cells were grown

324

on standard TAP media (Gorman and Levine, 1965) under 24-hr light conditions at ~22-25 ºC at

325

a photon flux of 125 µE/m2/sec on shaker tables rotating at 110 RPM.

326
327

Vector design & electroporation

328

SARS-CoV2 RBD Sequence design and optimization

329

The genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 (Wuhan-Hu-1 strain) was retrieved from the NCBI

330

(NC_045512). Amino acids 319 to 542 of the spike protein comprising the RBD were codon

331

optimized for C. reinhardtii nuclear genes (Amanat et al., 2020). Briefly, we generated a codon-

332

usage table using the mRNA sequences derived from the top 1600 (~10%) nuclear genes

333

expressed in C. reinhardtii in TAP media under light growth conditions (Ngan et al., 2015).

334

Codon optimization was then performed using Unipro UGENE (Okonechnikov et al., 2012) with

335

final codon rotations to avoid direct repeats or regions of >70% GC content that were flagged as

336

difficult to synthesize by the IDT gBlock design tool. The full codon optimized sequence was

337

synthetized as a double-stranded gBlock oligonucleotide by IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies

338

Coralville, IA).

340

Expression Vector design and assembly

341

The expression vector was derived from previously published pBR9 (Rasala et al., 2013), pOPT

342

mClover (Lauersen et al., 2015) and pHyg3 (Berthold et al., 2002). Standard PCR-based

343

amplification to add overlap-adaptors and Gibson-style assembly methods (HiFi Assembly Kit,

344

New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Massachusetts) were used to assemble the final vectors. The

345

entirety of the C. reinhardtii-specific payload was sequenced by Sanger Method at Eton

346

Bioscience (San Diego, CA).

347
348

Three different sub-cellular localization strategies were chosen for RBD expression. First, a

349

chloroplast-localized version was produced by N-terminal fusion of a previously characterized

350

psaE chloroplast transit sequence localization signal (Franzén et al., 1990) to the RBD domain

351

generating vector pRMC1. The genomic sequence spanning the psaE start codon until four

352

amino-acids after the CTS cleavage site were amplified from C. reinhardtii strain CC125

353

genomic DNA purified by standard Phenol/Chloroform/SDS lysis and Isopropanol/Ethanol

354

precipitation method. The second construct contained a secretion peptide motif (as predicted by

355

SignalP5.0) from the Pherophorin 2 gene (PHC2, Almagro Armenteros et al., 2019). The signal

356

peptide was specifically chosen because PHC2 is known to be abundant in the C. reinhardtii

357

secretome (Luxmi et al., 2018). The genomic locus was amplified and placed upstream of the

358

RBD coding sequence, as indicated above for the psaE CTS, to generate vector pRMC2. Finally,

359

an ER-Gogli retained version of the RBD was generated by adding an additional KDEL retention

360

motif to the C-terminus of the RBD coding sequence in pRMC2 to generate pRMC3. All vector

361

maps are included as genbank files in supplementary information.

363

Algae Transformation

364

All plasmid vectors were prepared by Qiagen midi prep and 10-20 ug of DNA linearized by

365

digest with KpnI-HF and XbaI restriction enzymes at 37oC in NEB Cutsmart buffer with enough

366

units of activity to generate ~5X overdigest in two hours (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA).

367

Reaction was stopped and DNA partially purified by NaCl/Isopropanol precipitation followed by

368

three 70% Ethanol washes and resuspension in 1 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA overnight at 4oC.

369

A starter culture of C. reinhardti strain CC124 was grown in standard TAP media to near

370

saturation (~3x106 cells/mL) then diluted back in to 0.25x106 cells/mL in 300 mL of TAP media

371

in a baffled flask ~24 hours before transformation. The next day, cells were collected at a density

372

of 0.75-1.0x106 cells/mL by centrifugation at 3000 rcf x 10 minutes at 16oC in sterile disposable

373

conical bottom centrifuge bottles. The cells were then resuspended in GeneArt® MAX

374

Efficiency® Transformation Reagent for Algae (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and

375

processed according to manufacturer’s instructions. Each construct was electroporated using a

376

Gene Pulser Xcell Electroporation System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) with 2 ug of

377

linearized vector DNA. After over-night recovery in 40 mM Sucrose in TAP media, cells were

378

pelleted, resuspended in 5 mL of fresh TAP media and 200 uL of cells spread on 10 cm diameter

379

plates containing 15 µg/mL Zeocin and 30 µg/mL Hygromycin B (Thermo Scientific, Waltham,

380

MA) in TAP+15 g/L agar media.

381
382

Transformant Down-Selection

383

Ten days after electroporation, individual colonies were transferred into 96-well microtiter plates

384

containing liquid TAP media; CC124 strain and previously generated GFP-expressing strain

385

(Fields et al., 2019) were included in each plate as internal positive and negative controls.

386

mClover fluorescence, chlorophyll fluorescence, and optical density were quantified following

387

previously published methods (Fields et al., 2019); mClover fluorescence was normalized to

388

chlorophyll to account for differences in cell density. The seven highest normalized mClover

389

fluorescence clones were then inoculated into 50 mL shaker cultures, and grown for three days

390

until late log phase was achieved (1-3x106 cells/mL), at which point one mL of culture was

391

harvested for further analysis. For pRMC1 and pRMC3 the supernatant was aspirated off and the

392

pellet was snap frozen at -70oC. For pRMC2 the 50 mL of supernatant was recovered,

393

centrifuged a second time to remove any residual cell debris, and then 40 mL of culture media

394

snap frozen. Subsequently, secreted RBD::mClover was precipitated by addition of solid

395

ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 302 g/L (~50% saturation at 0ºC), followed by

396

incubation over night at 4ºC with mixing, then centrifugation at 16x103 rcf. The supernatant was

397

removed and the pellet was resuspended in 200 µL of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5. In preparation

398

for Western Blot analysis, cell pellets were quick thawed in a room temperature water bath, lysed

399

in 100 µL of Bugbuster (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) for 10 minutes on ice with the

400

addition of Basemuncher (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), cell debris was pelleted (5 minutes x

401

16x103 rcf at 4oC) and 60 µL of clarified supernatant recovered. Proteins were denatured by

402

addition of 20 µL 4X Laemmli buffer with 10% BME and then heat treated at 80ºC for 10

403

minutes before 20 µL were loaded on to a Tris-Glycine TGX 12% acrylamide gel for SDS-

404

PAGE (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, California).

405
406

Western Blotting and Coomassie staining

407

After separation on acrylamide gels, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes via

408

semi-dry transfer (15 V x 60 minutes). Membranes were washed 3x2 minutes with TBSMT (50

409

mM TrisHCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) then blocked for 20 minutes in

410

Haycock’s blocking solution; 1% wt/vol Polyvinylpyrrolidone in TBSMT (Haycock, 1993).

411

Recombinant gene product was either detected with Goat anti-GFP conjugated to Alkaline

412

Phosphatase (ab6661 Abcam, Cambridge, Massachusetts) at 1:5000 dilution or 1:5000 Rabbit

413

Polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV2 RBD (Cat# 40592-T62 Sino Biological, Chesterbrook, PA), in

414

Haycock blocking solution. The latter was then detected with Goat anti-Rabbit::AP at 1:10,000

415

dilution. All antibodies were incubated for 60 minutes at room temperature and 4x3 minute

416

washes in TBSMT were conducted between steps. Chromogenic development was performed by

417

BCIP/NBT reaction in Alkaline Phosphatase buffer (100 mM TrisHCl pH 9.5, 5 mM MgSO4,

418

0.01% Tween-20) before quenching the reaction by washing in distilled water followed by

419

TBSMT. For all Coomassie stained gels proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE as above and

420

then stained with SimplyBlue™ SafeStain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) as per manufacturer’s

421

standard protocol.

422
423

Genotyping

424

The strains verified above as expressing RBD::mClover were subject to genomic DNA

425

extraction using the Chelex 100 boil method (HwangBo et al., 2010). Primers flanking the

426

transgene were then used to amplify the entirety of the RBD::mClover coding region using Q5

427

DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). PCR amplicons were size-verified by electrophoresis

428

on a 0.8% TAE agarose gel stained with SYBR Safe (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and

429

then excised and purified using the Wizard® SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System kit (Promega,

430

Madison, WI ) according to manufacturer’s protocol. The purified amplicons were then

431

subcloned in to pJet1.2 using the CloneJET PCR Cloning Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA)

according to manufacturer’s protocol and the ligation product transformed in to DH5alpha

433

chemically competent cells (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and sequenced using primers

Scaled Cultivation and Bulk Protein Purification

439

Algae cultures were grown in a semi-continuous fashion in 1 L baffled flasks in TAP media

440

wherein 95% of the culture was harvested via centrifuge and replaced with new media every two

441

days; harvested call pellets were snap frozen until lysis. Cells were lysed in 1X Bugbuster

442

(diluted from 10X buffer free stock) buffered with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH8.5 containing 1X Pierce

443

Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (A32955; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), 250 U/mL of

444

Basemuncher endonuclease (ab270049, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA. 10

445

mL of lysis buffer was added to each gram of snap frozen wet biomass with typically 3-6 grams

446

of wet biomass being processed at once. To the partially clarified cell lysate 10% wt/vol

447

Polyethylenimine ( Product#408719, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), adjusted to pH 8.5 by

448

addition of concentrated HCl was added to a final concentration 0.1% wt/vol. The lysate was

449

then centrifuged at 6000 rcf at 4ºC for 5 minutes and supernatant recovered. The lysate was then

450

further decolorized by gently shaking against an equal volume of Methyl tert-Butyl Ether twice

451

and then Hexanes (Fisher Scientific). The aqueous layer was then recovered, filtered through a

452

0.45 µm PES syringe filter and applied to a Capto Q anion exchange resin for column

453

chromatography purification on an Akta pure 150 system fitted with an external sample pump

454

(Cytiva, Amersham, UK).

Protein Chromatography

457

A 5 mL Capto Q resin anion exchange column (Cytiva) was equilibrated with 5 column volumes

458

(CV) of 50 mM TrisHCl pH8.5. The clarified and decolorized lysate was then applied to the

459

column through the system pump at 3 mL/minute. The column was washed with 10 CV

460

equilibration buffer. The RBD::mClover enriched fraction was eluted with 5 CV of 100 mM

461

NaCl in Tris-HCl pH8.5 buffer. During bulk purification ~20 mL of lysate was bound to the

462

column before binding capacity for the RBD was reached. When 40 mL of clarified lysate were

463

processed for bulk purification, 20 mL of lysate was first bound to the column, washed, and

464

eluted as above before the column being immediately stripped by the addition of 5 CV of 1 M

465

NaCl then 5 CV of 1 M NaOH before re-equilibrating with 10 CV 50 mM Tris-HCl and

466

performing a second purification cycle.

467

A 5 mL Phenyl resin prepacked Hydrophobic Interaction column (Cytiva) was equilibrated with

468

5 column volumes (CV) of 0.4 M (NH4)2SO4, 50 mM Sodium Phosphate buffer pH 7.4.

469

Immediately after Anion Exchange fractionation, the combined 100 mM NaCl fractions

470

containing the RBD::mClover were brought to 0.4 M (NH4)2SO4 by addition from a 2 M stock

471

solution. The RBD::mClover fraction was then applied to the Phenyl HP resin at a rate of 3

472

ml/min before being washed with 7.5 CV of 0.35 M (NH4)2SO4, 50 mM Sodium Phosphate

473

buffer pH 7.4. The bound RBD::mClover was then eluted by the addition of 5 CV of 0.15 M

474

(NH4)2SO4, 50 mM Sodium Phosphate buffer pH 7.4. The eluted fraction was then concentrated

475

using Amicon Ultra 15 diaconcentrators with a 10kDa cutoff (Cat # UFC901024, Millipore,

476

Temecula, CA) and buffer exchanged 3 times with PBS pH7,4 (Cat # 10010023 Gibco,

477

Waltham, MA) before concentrating down to 3 mL.

ACE2 Receptor Binding assay

480

Strepavidin coated microtiter plates (#15124, Thermo Fisher) washed 3X in Receptor Assay

481

Blocking buffer (25 mM TrisHCl, 150mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% wt/vol Bovine Serum Albumin,

482

0.05% vol/vol Tween-20) and then were coated with 50 ng per well of biotylated human ACE2

483

produced in HEK cells lines (#10108-H08H-B Sin Biological) dissolved in 100 µL of PBS for

484

one hour at room temperature with gentle shaking on an orbital table. Recombinant SARS-CoV-

485

2 RBD fused C-terminally to rabbit IgG Fc (RBD::rFc, # 40592-V31H Sino Biological) was

486

used as a specific competitor. A dilution series of 100 to 0.01 µg/mL RBD::rFc was made in PBS

487

containing 2 µg/mL of algae produced ER-Golgi retained RBD::mClover including a no-

488

RBD::rFc reference. Wells were washed four times with Receptor Assay Blocking buffer and

489

then filled with the RBD competitor solution at 30 µL/well for 1 hour at room temperature as

490

above. Wells were washed four times and then filled with 100 µL of Goat anti-GFP conjugated

491

to Horseradish Peroxidase (ab6663, Abcam) diluted 1:3000 in Receptor Assay Blocking buffer.

492

After a 30-minute incubation, wells were washed four times and then 100 µL of Pierce TMB

493

substrate kit added. The chromogenic reaction was incubated at room temperature for 20-25

494

minutes and then quenched with 100 uL of 2 M HCl. The absorption was then measured at 490

495

nm using a Tecan Infinite m200 Pro plate reader.

501

should be noted that the ER-Golgi retained version of RBD::mClover eluted at 100 mM NaCl in

502

one fraction when a 100 mM stepped gradient from 0 to 500 mM NaCl was tested, while the

503

Chloroplast directed version eluted over a broad range of salt concentrations from 200 to 400

504

mM NaCl, suggesting marked differences in affinity to the Capto Q anion exchange resin. The

505

RBD::mClover enriched fractions where then diaconcentrated and buffer exchanged three times

506

against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. These samples were then further purified using Anti-GFP

507

mAb-Magnetic Beads (# D153-11, MBL International, Woburn, MA) according to

508

manufacturer’s protocol except for washing with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5 with 0.05% Tween-20.

509

Samples were submitted for mass spectrometry at the University of California, San Diego’s

510

Biomolecular and Proteomics Mass Spectrometry Facility as either on-bead digestions or as

511

excised bands from SDS-PAGE gels stained with SimplyBlue Coomassie stain according to
