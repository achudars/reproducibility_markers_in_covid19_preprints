ABSTRACT
Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is expected to result in substantial reorganization of host cell RNA
metabolism. We identified 14 proteins that were predicted to interact with host RNAs or RNA
binding proteins, based on published data for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Here, we describe
a series of affinity-tagged and codon-optimized expression constructs for each of these 14
proteins. Each viral gene was separately tagged at the N-terminus with Flag-His8, the Cterminus with His8-Flag, or left untagged. The resulting constructs were stably integrated into the
HEK293 Flp-In TREx genome. Each viral gene was expressed under the control of an inducible
Tet-On promoter, allowing expression levels to be tuned to match physiological conditions during
infection. Expression time courses were successfully generated for most of the fusion proteins
and quantified by western blot. A few fusion proteins were poorly expressed, whereas others,
including Nsp1, Nsp12, and N protein, were toxic unless care was taken to minimize background
expression. All plasmids can be obtained from Addgene and cell lines are available. We
anticipate that availability of these resources will facilitate a more detailed understanding of
coronavirus molecular biology.

INTRODUCTION
SARS-CoV-2 is a large positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that encodes four structural
proteins, several accessory proteins, and sixteen nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16) (Figure 1).
The latter are mainly engaged in enzymatic activities important for translation and replication of
the RNA genome. In addition, nonstructural proteins also target host RNA metabolism in order to
manipulate cellular gene expression or facilitate immune evasion (Gordon et al, 2020; Thoms et
al, 2020; Yuen et al, 2020). Understanding these pathways in greater detail will be an important
step in the development of antiviral therapies.

Our lab has previously developed techniques to map the RNA-bound proteome, including
crosslinking and analysis of cDNA (CRAC), to identify binding sites for proteins on RNA, and
total RNA-associated proteome purification (TRAPP) to identify and quantify the RNA-bound
proteome (Granneman et al, 2009; Shchepachev et al, 2019). Among other things, TRAPP has
given insights into the mechanism of stress-induced translation shutdown in yeast (Bresson et
al, 2020). In the context of SARS-CoV-2, CRAC is expected to identify host RNAs that are
targeted by viral factors, while TRAPP will reveal how host cell RNA-protein interactions are
globally remodeled in response to specific viral proteins.

To facilitate application of these techniques to SARS-CoV-2, we generated a series of synthetic,
codon-optimized constructs for 14 different viral proteins that are expected to interact with RNA
or RNA binding proteins. To remove the need for error-prone PCR steps, we devised a cloning
scheme in which a single synthetic construct could be used to generate untagged, N-, or Cterminally tagged versions of the protein. Using these vectors, we generated and tested a series
of human cell lines with the viral ORFs stably integrated, under the control of an inducible TetOn promoter. We expect that broad availability of this collection will enable a deeper
understanding of the coronavirus life cycle and its impact on host RNA biology.

Figure 1. SARS-CoV-2 genome organization.
The viral genome consists of a ~30 kb positive-sense transcript that is capped and polyadenylated. Two overlapping
open reading frames (ORFs) are translated from the genomic RNA, ORF1a and ORF1ab. Translation of the ORF1b
region is mediated by a -1 frameshift allowing readthrough of the stop codon at the end of ORF1a. ORF1a and
ORF1ab encode large polyproteins that are cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins. Structural and accessory proteins
(shown in blue and pink, respectively) are separately translated from subgenomic RNAs. ORFs selected for tagging
are highlighted in green.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Design and cloning of viral expression constructs
We selected 14 proteins for initial analysis, based on putative roles in viral or host RNA
metabolism (Figure 1 and Table 1). Two of the selected proteins, Nsp7 and Nsp8, reportedly
form a stable heterodimer in vivo (Gao et al, 2020; Hillen et al, 2020; te Velthuis et al, 2012), so
we also designed constructs in which Nsp7 and Nsp8 were expressed as a fusion protein,
connected by a short, unstructured linker.

For cloning, we selected pcDNA5-FRT/TO (Thermo Fisher) as the backbone vector (Figure 2A).
This vector can be used for transient transfection or flippase (Flp) recombinase-mediated
integration into the genome of cells with a pre-inserted Flp Recombination Target (FRT). It also
carries a hygromycin resistance gene to allow selection for integration (Figure 2). As host cells,

we used HEK293 Flp-In T-REx cells (293FiTR), but other cell lines that carry an FRT site could
also be used.

The expression levels of viral proteins vary substantially during infection, so we used constructs
that, in addition to stably integrating, were expressed under the control of a tetracyclineregulated human cytomegalovirus (CMV) ⁄ TetO2 promoter, which is induced by the addition of
doxycycline to the medium (Figure 2). Viral protein expression can then be titrated by varying
either doxycycline concentration or induction time.

Table 1: Predicted molecular weights and putative functions of selected ORFs

Using pcDNA5-FRT/TO as a starting point, we generated two additional parental vectors with
pre-inserted tandem-affinity purification tags, either an N-terminal, FH-tag (FLAG-Ala4-His8) or Cterminal HF-tag (His8-Ala4-FLAG) (Figure 2A). We have recently shown that these tags work well
for tandem affinity purification, including in the denaturing conditions used for CRAC (Bresson et
al., 2020).

Each synthetic construct was codon-optimized and included a consensus Kozak sequence
upstream of the start codon (Figure 2B). The sequences initially used for all ORFs were
generated by the algorithms used by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT; Coralville, Iowa). The
prevalence of G-C base pairs, particularly in the third position of codons (GC3), is strongly
correlated with increased protein accumulation (Kudla et al, 2006; Mordstein et al, 2020). To
potentially enhance protein synthesis, we ordered alternative ORFs for Nsp8, Nsp13, and N,
using the algorithms from GeneArt (Thermo-Fisher Scientific), which have a higher G-C content,
particularly in third codon positions.

The insert sequences were designed such that a single synthetic construct could be used to
generate an untagged, or N- or C-terminal fusion protein (Figure 2B). BamHI and EcoRV
restriction sites were placed on either side of the open reading frame, together with an AvrII site
overlapping the stop codon (important for C-terminal cloning, as discussed below).

Generating the untagged and N-terminal tagged constructs was straightforward. The synthetic
constructs were cut with BamHI and EcoRV and ligated into pre-cut vector, either pcDNA5FRT/TO (generating an untagged construct), or pcDNA5-FRT/TO-N-Flag-His8 (generating an Nterminally tagged construct) (Figure 2C). The resulting plasmids were verified by colony PCR
and Sanger sequencing.

Generating the C-terminal tagged construct required additional steps to remove the in-frame
stop codon upstream of the EcoRV restriction site. Cleavage of the AvrII restriction site, which
overlaps the stop codon in the synthetic constructs (Figure 2B), left a 5′ overhang containing the
stop codon. Subsequently, the overhang (and thus the stop codon) was removed by treatment
with Mung Bean Nuclease, an ssDNA endonuclease (Figure 2C). The resulting fragment
possessed a blunt 3′ end, compatible with the EcoRV restriction site in the target vector.
Subsequently, the 5′ end of the insert was prepared by digestion with BamHI, and the resulting
fragment was ligated into pcDNA5-FRT/TO-C-His8-Flag pre-cut with BamHI and EcoRV.

In total, we generated 54 viral protein expression vectors, and 3 additional GFP expression
vectors as controls. These constructs, together with the parental tagging vectors, are listed in
Table 2.

common to all synthesized insert sequences. Each insert included BamHI and EcoRV sites at either end to facilitate
cloning into the three parental vectors. To allow for C-terminal cloning, an AvrII site was inserted such that it
overlapped the stop codon (see text for details). In order to accommodate the AvrII site, an alanine residue was added
to the end of each expression construct. The viral ORFs were codon-optimized for moderate or high expression, and
lacked BamHI, AvrII, and EcoRV sites. (C) For untagged and N-terminal tagging, inserts were digested with BamHI
and EcoRV and ligated directly into plasmid precut with the same enzymes. For C-terminal cloning, the inserts were
first digested with AvrII, blunted with Mung Bean Nuclease, and then cut with BamHI. The resulting fragment was
ligated into plasmid cut with BamHI and EcoRV. (D) Untagged, N-, and C-terminally tagged expression constructs. (E)

Expression of fusion proteins
Each construct was introduced into Flp-In T-REx cells (Thermo Fisher) by transfection, followed
by hygromycin treatment for 10-16 days to select for chromosomal integration (Figure 2E). In the
initial experiments, all constructs except the Nsp1 series, and the GC3 (high-expression)
optimized versions of untagged N and FH-N protein yielded stable hygromycin-resistant cells
(Table 2, column 4). Resistant clones were obtained for FH-N by co-transfecting this construct
with a plasmid encoding a tetracycline repressor protein (pcDNA6/TR), to suppress possible
high levels of FH-N expression at initial transfection.

For expression analyses, doxycycline was added to the cell culture medium to a final
concentration of 1 g ml-1, and timepoints were collected for analysis by western blot. A
prominent cross-reacting band visible in all samples was used as a loading control for most
analyses. The exceptions were Nsp15 and Nsp12, for which anti-M2-Flag and GAPDH were
used, as they have migration positions close to the cross-reacting band. Representative data are
shown in Figure 3B-C; all other western scans are shown in Figure S1. Quantitation is shown in
Figure S2, and associated raw data are presented in Table S4. Clear protein expression was
observed for 29 of the 34 tagged constructs (Table 2, column 5). In general, C-terminal tagged
proteins were more highly expressed than their N-terminally tagged counterparts.

As described above, we were initially unable to generate stable cell lines for any of the Nsp1
constructs. To confirm that Nsp1 could be expressed in cells, we transiently transfected each
construct into 293FiTR cells, and confirmed protein expression by western blot. Only the Cterminally tagged Nsp1 showed robust expression (Figure S3).

representative blot showing induction for C-terminally tagged Nsp2 (lanes 2-7). A prominent cross-reacting band was
used as a loading control. To quantify protein abundance, each blot included a normalization standard (lane 1),
consisting of lysate from cells expressing N-terminally tagged N protein for 6 h derived from (A). (C) Quantification of
the protein bands in (B). Expression was normalized to both the loading control and the N protein standard.

To allow absolute quantification of SARS-CoV-2 protein expression, we used the N-terminally
tagged N protein (integrated from plasmid 22; moderate expression) as a reference standard.
Cells containing integrated FH-N were treated with doxycycline for 0, 6, and 18 hours. Protein
was extracted, separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed using mass spectrometry with label-free
quantification. To compare proteins, their abundance was expressed as a percentage of the total
proteome. This value was calculated using the relative, intensity-based absolute quantification
(riBAQ) score for each protein, which represents the iBAQ score for a given protein divided by
the iBAQ scores for all proteins. After induction for six hours, N protein comprised 0.022% of the
cellular proteome (Figure 3A).

Because all of the tagged proteins possessed an identical FLAG epitope, aliquots of this 6h N
protein sample could then be used as a reference standard on all subsequent western blots (e.g.
lane 1 in Figure 3B), to allow similar abundance estimates for the other viral proteins (Figure S2
and Table S3). This approach allows viral protein levels to be carefully titrated, so that protein
induction approximately matches physiological conditions. This is important because different
viral proteins show extreme differences in expression during infection. The nucleocapsid (N)
protein can represent 2% of total protein, whereas the non-structural proteins may be 2 to 3
orders of magnitude less abundant (Finkel et al, 2020; Grenga et al, 2020). Moreover, all
proteins will vary in their abundance throughout the course of infection.

Conclusions
In summary, we report the construction of 57 expression vectors and cell lines. These plasmids
can be obtained from Addgene and cell lines are available. We expect that these collections will
be a valuable resource for future research into the mechanisms by which coronavirus exploits
the genetic machinery of its host to facilitate its own replication.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Construction of expression vectors
All viral genes were cloned into each of three parental vectors: pcDNA5-FRT-TO (to generate an
untagged version of the protein), pcDNA5-FRT-TO-N-Flag-His8 (N-terminal tag), and pcDNA5FRT-TO-C-His8-Flag (C-terminal tag). The N-terminal tag consisted of a single Flag motif, a
four-alanine spacer, eight consecutive histidine residues, and a short unstructured linker
(DYKDDDDKAAAAHHHHHHHHGSG). The C-terminal tag was essentially the same but in
reverse (SGGHHHHHHHHAAAADYKDDDDK).

Construction of pcDNA5-FRT-TO-N-Flag-His8
To generate the Flag-His8 tag, we first designed partially complementary DNA oligonucleotides
(oSB707 and oSB708) containing the Flag-His sequence. These oligos contained 20 nucleotides
of complementarity at their 3′ ends, and an additional 35-36 nucleotides at their 5′ ends. The
oligos were annealed in a reaction consisting of 12.5 µM forward oligo and 12.5 µM reverse
oligo in a 40 µL reaction volume. The hybridization reaction was initially incubated at 95°C for 6
min, and gradually decreased to 25°C at the rate of 1.33°C/min. Subsequently, the annealed
oligos were incubated in the same buffer supplemented with 250 µM dNTPs and 5U Klenow
exo- (NEB) in a 50µL reaction at 37°C to fill in the single-stranded regions. After 1 hour, the
insert sequence was purified on a silica column (Oligo Clean & Concentrator, Zymo Research).

The insert fragment was then digested with restriction enzymes to facilitate cloning into the
acceptor plasmid pcDNA5-FRT-TO. The insert was digested at 37°C for 2 hours in a reaction
consisting of 800 ng of DNA, 1X Cutsmart buffer (NEB), 40U HindIII-HF (NEB), and 40U BamHIHF (NEB). Subsequently, the DNA was purified, as above. In parallel, pcDNA5-FRT-TO was
digested under identical conditions but with 2 μg of DNA. The digested DNA was subsequently
purified on a silica column (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit; Qiagen). To prevent self-ligation, the
vector DNA was phosphatase treated in a reaction consisting of ~2 μg of DNA, 50mM Bis-TrisPropane-HCl pH 6, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ZnCl2, and 5U of Antarctic phosphatase (NEB) at 37°C
for 40 minutes. The DNA was again purified.

Finally, the digested Flag-His insert sequence was ligated into the digested and phosphatasetreated pcDNA5-FRT-TO acceptor plasmid. The ligation reaction consisted of 0.013 pmol vector,
0.042 pmol insert, 50 mM Tris-HCl 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 10 mM DTT, and 400U of T4
DNA ligase (NEB) in a 20 µL reaction volume. The ligation mix was transformed into homemade

DH5α E. coli, and plated overnight on LB-Amp. DNA was isolated from several colonies and
sequenced to ensure correct insertion of the Flag-His sequence.

Construction of pcDNA5-FRT-TO-C-His8-Flag
The pcDNA5-FRT-TO-C-His8-Flag sequence was generated as described above for the Nterminal tagging vector, with the following changes: 1) the oligos used for hybridization were
oSB709 and oSB710, and 2) the insert and pcDNA5-FRT-TO were digested with 40U of EcoRVHF (NEB) and 40U of XhoI (NEB).

Cloning of untagged and N-terminally tagged viral genes
pcDNA5-FRT-TO and pcDNA-FRT-TO-N-Flag-His8 were each digested in a 50 µL reaction
consisting of 2 µg DNA, 1X Cutsmart buffer, 20U of BamHI-HF, and 20U of EcoRV at 37°C for
two hours. In parallel, 2µg of plasmid (KanR) containing the desired viral gene was digested
under identical conditions. All three reactions were purified using a PCR cleanup kit.
Subsequently, the acceptor plasmids were phosphatase treated as described above and again
purified using a PCR cleanup kit.

Digested vector and insert were ligated together in a reaction consisting of 40 ng vector, 120 ng
insert, 50 mM Tris-HCl 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 10 mM DTT, and 400 U of T4 DNA ligase
(NEB) in a 10 µL reaction volume. The ligation mix was transformed into homemade DH5α E.
coli, and plated overnight on LB-Amp. Colony PCR was performed using oAH195-196 to verify
the presence of the insert, and positive clones were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

Cloning of C-terminally tagged viral genes
To prepare the backbone, 2 µg of pcDNA5-FRT-TO-C-His8-Flag was digested with BamHI-HF
and EcoRV-HF, as above, followed by DNA purification. To prepare viral gene inserts, 1 µg of
pUC containing the relevant gene was initially digested with AvrII in the same reaction conditions
followed by purification. The 5' overhang, encoding the stop codon, was then removed by
digestion with Mung Bean Nuclease (New England Biolabs): 1 U of Mung Bean Nuclease was
added to 1 µg of digested vector in 30 µl of 1x Cutsmart buffer, and incubated for 30 minutes at
30 °C. . After purification, the final insert was produced by digestion with BamHI-HF. The insert
was then ligated into the backbone after purification, following procedure described above with a
4:1 molar ratio of insert to backbone.

The eGFP insert was amplified using pEGFP-N2 (Clontech) as a template and the DNA
oligonucleotides oAH211 and oAH212 (untagged and N-terminal cloning) or oAH211 and
oAH213 (C-terminal cloning). Subsequently, the PCR-generated inserts were cloned into
pcDNA5-FRT-TO, pcDNA-FRT-TO-N-Flag-His8, and pcDNA5-FRT-TO-C-His8-Flag as
described above for the viral constructs.

Cell culture and transfection
Generation of stable cell lines
HEK293 Flip-In TREx cells (Thermo Fisher) were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 in DMEM
(Thermo-Fisher) supplemented with 10% tetracycline-tested FBS (Sigma), 100 µg/mL Zeocin
(Thermo-Fisher), and 15 µg/mL Blasticidin S (Sigma). Approximately 1x106 cells were seeded
without antibiotics on six-well plates 24 hours prior to transfection. The following day, the viral
expression constructs and pOG44 (the FRT recombinase) were co-transfected in a 1:9 ratio (1
µg total) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo-Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

The medium was replaced approximately five hours later to remove the transfection reagents.
The next day, the cells were split to a 10 cm plate, and after an additional 24 hours, hygromycin
B (150 µg/mL) and blasticidin S (15 µg/mL) were added to the medium. Stable integrants were
selected over the course of 10-16 days, with medium replacement at regular intervals.
Thereafter, stable cell lines were maintained in hygromycin B and blasticidin S.

For the FH-N constructs that initially yielded no colonies, transfection was repeated with the
addition of pcDNA6/TR (Invitrogen), encoding the tetracycline repressor protein: total transfected
DNA was kept at 1 µg, with pcDNA5/FRT-TO, pcDNA6/TR and pOG44 used at a ratio of
1:4.5:4.5.

Transient transfection of Nsp1
Approximately 2x105 cells were seeded without antibiotics on 24-well plates. The following day,
0.2 µg of FH-Nsp1 or Nsp1-HF was transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Induction tests
For induction tests, 1-2x105 cells were plated into 6 wells each of a 24-well plate. The following
day, the cells were induced with 1 µg/mL of doxycycline, and harvested at varying timepoints by
resuspending the cells in 50-100 µL of 1X Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Inductions were

staggered so that all timepoints could be harvested simultaneously. For the transient transfection
experiments, cells were induced two hours post-transfection with 1 µg/mL of doxycycline. As
with the stable cell lines, inductions were staggered and all timepoints were harvested at once.

For proteins larger than 20 kDa, cell lysates were resolved on 4-12% Bis-Tris gels, run at 180V
for 1h in 1X MOPS (ThermoFisher, NP0001). For smaller proteins, lysates were run for 25 min in
MES buffer (Thermo Fisher, NP0002). Proteins were wet transferred onto PVDF membrane
(Millipore, IPFL00010), blocked with 5% skimmed milk and probed successively with anti-Flag
(Agilent, 200474-21) and anti-Rat (Licor, 926-68076). This anti-Flag antibody generate a
prominent cross-reacting band at around 50 kDa which was used for loading normalization. For
proteins running at the same size of the cross-reacting band (Nsp15 and Nsp12), an anti-M2FLAG antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, F1804) was used in combination with anti-GAPDH (BioRad,
VPA00187) as the loading control. For these, anti-Mouse (Licor, 926-68070) and anti-Rabbit
(Licor, 926-32211) were then used. Protein bands were visualized and quantified by scanning in
a Licor Odyssey CLX. Normalization was performed using the appropriate loading control and
the N protein expression standard which was included on each gel.

Mass spectrometry
HEK293 cells with stably integrated N-terminal tagged N protein (from plasmid 22) were induced
with 1 µg/ml doxycyline for 0, 6, and 18 hours. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer containing
0.1% Rapigest and sonicated (10 cycles of 30 seconds on, 30 seconds off in Bioruper,
Diagenode). Approximately 30 μg of protein was resolved on a 4-20% Miniprotean TGX gel, run
in Tris-Glycine running buffer at 100 V. Subsequently, the gel was rinsed with water, stained for
1 hour with Imperial Protein Stain (Thermo Scientific), rinsed several times, and destained in
water for three hours. Each lane was cut into four fractions and processed using in-gel digestion
and the STAGE tip method, as previously described (Bresson et al., 2020; Rappsilber et al,
2007).
