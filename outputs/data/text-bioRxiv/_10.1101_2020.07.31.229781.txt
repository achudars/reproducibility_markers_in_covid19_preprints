ABSTRACT

27

SARS-CoV-2 invades human respiratory epithelial cells via an interaction

28

between its spike RBD protein (SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD) and the host cell receptor

29

angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). Blocking this interaction provides a potent

30

approach to preventing and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this work, the

31

ability of β-chitosan to block the binding interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD

32

and ACE2 was investigated. The inhibitory effect of β-chitosan on inflammation

33

induced by the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD was also studied. Native-PAGE analysis

34

indicated that β-chitosan could bind with ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and a

35

conjugate of β-chitosan and ACE2 could no longer bind with the SARS-CoV-2

36

S-RBD. HPLC analysis suggested that a conjugate of β-chitosan and the

37

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD displayed high binding affinity without dissociation under high

38

pressure (40 MPa) compared with that of β-chitosan and ACE2. Furthermore,

39

immunofluorescent staining of Vero E6 cells and lungs from hACE2 mice showed

40

that the presence of β-chitosan prevented SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD from binding to ACE2.

41

Meanwhile, β-chitosan could dramatically suppress the inflammation caused by the

42

presence of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD both in vitro and vivo. Moreover, the decreased

43

expression of ACE2 caused by β-chitosan treatment was restored by addition of

44

TAPI-1, an inhibitor of the transmembrane protease ADAM17. Our findings

45

demonstrated that β-chitosan displays an antibody-like function capable of

46

neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and effectively preventing the binding of the

47

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2. Moreover, ADAM17 activation induced by β-chitosan

48

treatment can enhance the cleavage of the extracellular domain of ACE2, releasing the

49

active ectodomain into the extracellular environment, which can prevent the binding,

50

internalization, and degradation of ACE2 bound to the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and thus

51

diminish inflammation. Our study provides an alternative avenue for preventing

52

SARS-CoV-2 infection using β-chitosan.

INTRODUCTION

57

According to the latest WHO data (10 September, 2020), the Coronavirus

58

Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has spread to more than 200 countries and

59

regions and caused more than 27 million confirmed infections, as well as 899

60

thousand deaths to date, presenting a major threat to public health. Although

61

SARS-CoV-2 was quickly discovered and identified as the pathogen driving the

62

disease outbreak1,2, no successful vaccines or specific drugs have been identified and

63

put to use thus far. As a result, the daily numbers of confirmed infections and deaths

64

are still climbing. Therefore, elucidating the mechanisms underlying COVID-19

65

pathogenesis and developing effective therapeutics to prevent and control the current

66

pandemic have become of the utmost importance.

67

At the molecular level it has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) uses

68

the same cell entry receptor (ACE2) as SARS-CoV2. Bioinformatic analyses also

69

revealed that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of SARS-CoV,

70

suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 can infect host cells by binding to ACE2 on the surface

71

of host cells through its spike protein3. Hoffmann4 then confirmed at the cellular level

72

that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor, ACE2, to enter host cells as SARS-CoV. As

73

a result of these findings, focus shifted to identifying which tissues and organs express

74

ACE2. Several studies reported that ACE2 was not only highly expressed in the lungs,

75

upper esophagus, and stratified squamous epithelium, but also in absorptive

76

enterocytes from the ileum of the small intestine and the colon5,6. This led to

77

speculation that SARS-CoV-2 may bind with ACE2 to invade and damage the

78

relevant tissues in infected patients. Since SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have similar

79

gene sequences, the same binding receptor, and similar clinical manifestations, it is

80

plausible that there may be similar mechanisms of pathogenesis for the two viruses.

81

Endocytosis is induced by the binding of virus to ACE2, resulting in the degradation

82

of the majority of ACE2 and significantly increased angiotensin II (Ang ) levels,

83

which leads to a cytokine storm and multiple organ damage7. Structural analysis of

84

ACE2 may help facilitate the design of therapeutic antibodies to prevent

85

SARS-CoV-2 infection. Yan et al. 8 were the first to present cryo-electron microscopy

86

structures of full-length human ACE2 and pointed out that the spike protein of

87

SARS-CoV-2 binds to the extracellular peptidase domain of ACE2 mainly through

88

polar residues. Wrapp et al.9 obtained a 3.5-angstrom-resolution cryo-electron

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.31.229781; this version posted September 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

89

microscopy structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation, and

90

demonstrated that the affinity of ACE2 binding to the 2019-nCoV spike was 10-20

91

folds greater than the observed affinity for ACE2 binding with the SARS-CoV spike,

92

suggesting a rationale for the higher infectivity and pathogenicity rate of 2019-nCoV

93

compared to SARS-CoV. Thus, it is of great significance to identify molecules that

94

could prevent the binding of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 in order to prevent and control

95

the spread of COVID-19.

96

ACE2 that can protect from severe acute lung failure is the receptor of

97

SARS-CoV-2, which has posed a dilemma for the development of therapies targeted

98

at ACE2. Many reports have confirmed that the ACE2 and ACE genes originated from

99

the same common ancestor10,11, making human ACE2 closely related to human ACE.

100

Several studies have confirmed that chitosan binds to the active site of ACE to inhibit

101

its activity, exerting an antihypertensive effect12,13. Moreover, since it results in no

102

toxic and side effects for humans, chitosan has become a subject of much research as

103

an antihypertensive functional food and adjuvant drug for various conditions. When

104

comparing the structures of ACE and ACE2 (PDB ID codes 1O8A and 1R42,

105

respectively), it is apparent that both proteins have the same active zinc-binding motif

106

(HEMGH). This implies that ACE2 can likely also bind with chitosan since it has the

107

same active site as ACE. If chitosan can block the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2

108

and remain the antihypertensive activity of ACE2, this study will have great scientific

109

significance. Due to its unique biochemical and physicochemical properties, chitosan

110

has been widely applied in the food and cosmetic industries as well as in the

111

biomedical field. Chitosan occurs in three distinct crystalline polymorphic forms: α-,

112

β- and γ-chitosan14-16. Chitosan is normally dissolved in acidic conditions and

113

precipitates when the pH of the solution is above 7, which has greatly limited its

114

utilization in cell and animal studies. Compared with α-chitosan, β-chitosan has

115

weaker intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding forces, higher solubility,

116

and greater biological activity.

117

Previous work indicated that β-chitosan (Mendel®) can be stably dissolved in a

118

buffer solution with a similar pH and ionic concentration (pH 7.4, 20 mM) to human

119

bodily fluids, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 1. Therefore, β-chitosan treatment was

120

utilized to investigate its ability to block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD

121

and ACE2 at the molecular, cellular, and animal levels. This work provides a

122

promising approach to the prevention and control of SARS-CoV-2 infection using

β-chitosan.

124

RESULTS

125

I In vitro molecular interaction model for studying the effect of β-chitosan on the

126

binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD with ACE2

127

An in vitro molecular interaction model was used to explore the effect of

128

β-chitosan treatment on the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2. The

129

co-incubation mixtures collected were analyzed by Native-PAGE. As shown in Fig.

130

1b and Fig. 1c, the IODs of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD incubated with

131

β-chitosan (lanes 3 and 5) decreased by 95.8% and 94.8% when compared with those

132

of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD (lane 2 and 4), respectively. This finding indicates

133

that β-chitosan has a strong binding affinity to ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD

134

under normal physiological conditions in vitro. In addition, the IOD of the

135

co-incubation mixture of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD in lane 6 was reduced

136

significantly compared with that of ACE2 or SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD, respectively,

137

suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD is strongly bound to ACE2. With the addition of

138

β-chitosan, the IOD in lane 7 was decreased significantly, which demonstrated that

139

β-chitosan treatment inhibited the binding of ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD.

140

Fig. 1

141

In order to confirm whether the conjugate of β-chitosan and ACE2 (termed

142

β-chitosan~ACE2) could rebind the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD, we designed a creative

143

experiment shown in Fig. 1a. Under the experimental condition of excess ACE2

144

relative to β-chitosan, the same amount of ACE2 was mixed and incubated with

145

different amounts of β-chitosan. Then, this experiment was repeated with excess

146

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD added during the co-incubation. The samples were then

147

analyzed by Native-PAGE. With increasing β-chitosan levels, β-chitosan~ACE2

148

levels correspondingly increased and the surplus unbound ACE2 levels decreased. As

149

a specific receptor binding domain of ACE2, the excess unbound SARS-CoV-2

150

S-RBD should bind to the excess ACE2. When the same amounts of SARS-CoV-2

151

S-RBD were added, it was unclear whether the final remaining SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD

152

would bind with ACE2 and/or β-chitosan to form a conjugate. The following three

153

situations could occur for the remaining SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD (Fig. 1a): (1) only

154

~β-chitosan or ~ACE2 could continually bind with the remaining SARS-CoV-2

155

S-RBD, then eventually the remaining SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD amounts would be the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.31.229781; this version posted September 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

156

same and the IODs would show no difference; (2) both ~β-chitosan and ~ACE2 could

157

continually bind with the remaining SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD, then the remaining

158

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD levels and IODs would gradually decrease; (3) neither

159

~β-chitosan nor ~ACE2 could continually bind with the surplus SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD,

160

the remaining SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and grey values would gradually increase.

161

Native-PAGE results showed that the IODs for the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD increased

162

gradually (lane 8-10 in Fig. 1c), which is in accordance with the third speculation.

163

These findings indicates that β-chitosan can bind with ACE2 and potently block the

164

binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2.

165

HPLC was also used to analyze the co-incubation mixtures collected. As shown

166

in Fig. 1d, for ACE2 there was only a characteristic peak at 9.17 min (Fig. 1d-), and

167

two peaks were observed for SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD at 10.081 min and 11.765 min

168

(Fig. 1d-). This double peak is likely because the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD is composed

169

of polymers and monomers. Moreover, no peak for β-chitosan was observed in the

170

current detection system (Fig. 1d-). Two peaks were observed for the conjugate of

171

the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and ACE2 (Fig. 1d-), and the retention times (tR) shifted

172

to 8.187 min and 9.086 min, respectively, indicating that the combination of

173

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and ACE2 causes a shift in tR. For the co-incubation mixture of

174

β-chitosan and ACE2, only one peak (9.17 min in Fig. 1d-) was observed and the

175

peak area was similar to that of ACE2 by itself, as shown in Fig. 1d-. This finding

176

suggested that the conjugate of β-chitosan and ACE2 present at atmospheric pressure

177

dissociated under conditions of high pressure (40 MPa), which indicated that the

178

binding interaction between β-chitosan and ACE2 is relatively weak. Interestingly, the

179

conjugate of β-chitosan and the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD showed a peak at 10.81 min

180

with a peak area similar to the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD in Fig. 1d-, while the second

181

peak disappeared (Fig. 1d-). This finding illustrated that the binding interaction

182

between β-chitosan and the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD is very strong. Similar experiments

183

were performed to verify whether the conjugate of β-chitosan and the SARS-CoV-2

184

S-RBD can bind with ACE2. As shown in Fig. 1d-, only one ACE2 peak was

185

observed in the mixture and the peak area was similar to that of ACE2 alone (Fig.

186

1d-). This result revealed that the conjugate of β-chitosan and the SARS-CoV-2

187

S-RBD could not bind with ACE2, which was consistent with the above Native-PAGE

188

analysis. If β-chitosan~ACE2 dissociates at 40 MPa, the dissociated ACE2 would

189

then bind with the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD, leading to results similar to those in Fig.

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.31.229781; this version posted September 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

190

1d-. However, the results in Fig. 1d- revealed a significant difference, indicating

191

that β-chitosan may interfere with the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2.

192

Therefore, the results of the in vitro molecular model indicate that β-chitosan can

193

neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and block the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to

194

ACE2, suggesting that β-chitosan can shield ACE2 from being bound by the

195

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD.

196
197

II In vitro Vero E6 cell model for studying the effect of β-chitosan treatment on

198

the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD with ACE2

199

Immunofluorescence (IF), flow cytometry (FCM) and Western blot (WB)

200

analysis were used to investigate β-chitosan-mediated inhibition of the binding of the

201

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2 in a Vero E6 cell model. Based on previous work that

202

indicated

203

inflammation-related proteins in Vero E6 cells (Extended Data Fig. 2), a 500 μg/mL

204

dose of β-chitosan was selected for further experiments.

of

205

IF analysis showed that ACE2 (red) and the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD (green)

206

presented strong fluorescence signals following the addition of the SARS-CoV-2

207

S-RBD into Vero E6 cells (Fig. 2a-). Moreover, significant colocalization of ACE2

208

with SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD was observed, implying that the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD

209

binds to ACE2. When β-chitosan was added to the above system 10 min later, the

210

colocalization of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD was reduced (Fig. 2A-),

211

indicating that β-chitosan can prevent the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2

212

exposed on the surface of Vero E6 cells. When β-chitosan and the SARS-CoV-2

213

S-RBD were added successively, the fluorescence intensities of ACE2 and the

214

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD were also significantly reduced (Fig. 2A-). This suggested

215

that β-chitosan treatment down-regulates the expression of ACE2 in Vero E6 cells,

216

resulting in a decreased binding probability for the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD with Vero

217

E6 cells. When mixtures of β-chitosan and SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD were added to Vero

218

E6 cells, the fluorescence intensities of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD decreased

219

significantly and no colocalization was observed (Fig. 2A-), indicating that

220

β-chitosan demonstrates a neutralizing activity against the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD. In

221

addition, it was also observed that the addition of β-chitosan alone significantly

222

decreased ACE2 expression in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 2A-).

224

FCM was used to detect the effect of β-chitosan treatment on Vero E6 cells

225

infected with the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD (Fig. 2b). Under the same parameters, 8000

226

cells were selected for analysis, and the colocalization of each experimental group

227

was compared. It was found that the colocalization of ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2

228

S-RBD reached 33.6% (green line in Fig. 2b) in Vero E6 cells following a 10 min

229

incubation with the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD. When β-chitosan was added into the above

230

system 10 min later, the colocalization proportion fell to 22.4% (yellow line in Fig.

231

2b), indicating that the addition of β-chitosan decreased binding of the SARS-CoV-2

232

S-RBD to Vero E6 cells. When both β-chitosan and the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD were

233

added successively to Vero E6 cells in culture for 10 min (red line in Fig. 2b),

234

respectively, the colocalization proportion was only 11.4%, indicating that β-chitosan

235

could significantly diminish binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD with Vero E6 cells.

236

When mixtures of β-chitosan and the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD were added to Vero E6

237

cells, the colocalization proportion was only 6.91%, which further supports the

238

conclusion that β-chitosan possesses neutralizing activity against the SARS-CoV-2

239

S-RBD.

240

The expression levels of proteins involved in inflammation response signaling

241

pathways were analyzed by WB. p-JNK, p-IKK, p-IκB, and p-c-Jun are known to

242

play a role in the response to inflammation. Nur77, an orphan member of the nuclear

243

receptor superfamily, is expressed in macrophages following application of

244

inflammatory stimuli17. The expression of Nur77, p-JNK, p-IKK, p-IκB, and p-c-Jun

245

were all up-regulated significantly in Vero E6 cells following exposure to the

246

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD for 10 min (Fig. 2c). However, the expression of these proteins

247

was significantly down-regulated when Vero E6 cells exposed to the SARS-CoV-2

248

S-RBD were treated with β-chitosan for 10 min. These results indicated that the

249

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD can induce inflammation in cells. However, the addition of

250

β-chitosan inhibited the activation of inflammatory response signaling pathways, thus

251

exerting an anti-inflammatory effect in cells.

253

III In vivo animal model for examining effect of β-chitosan treatment on the

254

binding of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2

255

FITC tags are often used to observe β-chitosan metabolism in vivo. However, the

256

dissociation of β-chitosan-FITC during metabolism can lead to a false positive. Thus,

257

β-chitosan was delivered intranasally to mice and Calcofluor White (CFW) was then

258

used to observe its metabolic distribution 18. After intranasal administration for 1 h, 2

259

h, and 4 h, the metabolism and distribution of β-chitosan in the lungs of mice was

260

analyzed. The blue fluorescence signal from the β-chitosan dyed with CFW was

261

clearly distributed throughout the lungs of the mice (Fig. 3a). These results indicated

262

that intranasally administered β-chitosan spreads throughout the lungs and attaches to

263

lung epithelial cells over time, confirming the utility of this delivery route for the

264

further evaluation of the antiviral effects of β-chitosan in the lung.

265

Fig. 3

266

The preventive and alleviative effect of β-chitosan on the morphological lesion

267

induced by SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD in mouse lungs was further observed (Fig. 3b). The

268

lungs of hACE2 mice infected with the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD were obviously swollen.

269

However, the lungs of hACE2 mice treated with β-chitosan showed no difference

270

from the control mice, indicating that β-chitosan treatment could inhibit the

271

pathological changes in the lungs of hACE2 mice caused by the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD.

272

However, the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD did not cause lung enlargement in wild-type (WT)

273

mice, which indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD has a specific effect on the

274

morphological lesions present in hACE2 mice.

275

The expression of ACE2 and its colocalization with SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD for

276

WT and hACE2 mice were determined using IF. In WT mouse lungs, the number of

277

cells per unit area and the fluorescence intensity of ACE2 increased significantly in

278

the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD infected group as shown in Fig. 3c. However, the number of

279

cells in hACE2 mouse lungs was significantly decreased and no obvious ACE2

280

immunofluorescence was observed in the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD infected group. There

281

were some similar phenomena observed between the two genotypes of mice. A visible

282

immunofluorescence signal for the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and the colocalization of the

283

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD with ACE2 could be observed, implying that the lung cells of

284

both WT and hACE2 mice can bind with the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD through their

ACE2 receptor. For the prevention groups (treated with β-chitosan and SARS-CoV-2

286

S-RBD successively) and treatment groups (treated with SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and

287

β-chitosan successively), no obvious SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD immunofluorescence

288

signal was observed, which indicated that β-chitosan has a therapeutic effect by

289

blocking the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to lung cells in both types of mice.

290

In addition, the expression of ACE2 and inflammation-related proteins were

291

analyzed and compared by WB. For the groups infected with the SARS-CoV-2

292

S-RBD (SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD group), ACE2 expression was distinctly reduced in

293

comparison with the uninfected control groups of WT and hACE2 mice, respectively.

294

For the prevention groups and treatment groups, the expression of ACE2 in both two

295

types of mice was significantly decreased compared with that of the SARS-CoV-2

296

S-RBD groups (Fig. 3d). Moreover, expression of inflammation-related proteins

297

(such as p-JNK and p-c-Jun) in the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD groups was significantly

298

up-regulated when compared with the control group (Fig. 3d). However, the

299

expression levels of these proteins in the experimental groups treated with β-chitosan

300

were significantly down-regulated. The results indicated that β-chitosan treatment

301

could modulate ACE2 expression to decrease SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD infection. While

302

the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD promotes inflammation in the lung tissue,

303

β-chitosan treatment can inhibit the activation of inflammation-related signaling

304

pathways and exerts an anti-inflammatory effect. In general, the results of the animal

305

model studies are consistent with those of the cell model.

306
307

IV Regulation of ACE2 expression by β-chitosan

308

The above results suggested that β-chitosan treatment could significantly

309

down-regulate ACE2 expressions in Vero E6 cells and lung cells in hACE2 mice.

310

However, this decrease in ACE2 expression did not cause inflammation, on the

311

contrary, β-chitosan treatment appeared to inhibit the inflammation induced by the

312

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD. The above mentioned results indicated that β-chitosan could

313

reduce ACE2 expression without affecting its antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory

314

effects, which implies that there might be another mechanism behind the decreased

315

expression of ACE2. It was reported that ACE2 could be cleaved by the ADAM17

316

metalloproteinase, preventing the binding of SARS to the ACE2 receptor19. However,

317

whether the decreased ACE2 expression observed in this study is related to ADAM17

318

activity is unknown. Therefore, an ADAM17 inhibitor was used in the context of IF

319

and WB analyses to determine the role of this activity in this system.

320

The results of these experiments demonstrated that β-chitosan treatment

321

significantly decreased the expression of ACE2 in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 4). When the

322

ADAM17 inhibitor (TAPI-1) was added in advance, the expression of ACE2 was

323

significantly up-regulated compared with that of the no TAPI-1 treatment group. Thus,

324

these findings support the conclusion that the decreased ACE2 expression observed

325

with β-chitosan treatment is caused by the activation of ADAM17. Moreover, the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.31.229781; this version posted September 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

326

activation of ADAM17 could improve the cleavage of the ACE2 extracellular

327

juxtamembrane region, which possesses catalytic activity against Ang II. The release

328

of the catalytically active ectodomain into the extracellular environment can result in

329

decreased binding interactions between cells and the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD, thus

330

giving the appearance of down-regulated ACE2 expression. Furthermore, the cleaved

331

extracellular domain of ACE2 retains its catalytic activity that degrades Ang II and

332

promotes antihypertensive effects.

DISCUSSION

336

In this work, binding of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to β-chitosan was confirmed by

337

Native-PAGE and HPLC. Interestingly, β-chitosan can bind with high affinity to the

338

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD without dissociation under high pressure. Thus, an additional in

339

vitro molecular experiment was designed to verify that the conjugate of β-chitosan

340

and ACE2 could no longer bind with the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD. IF studies revealed

341

that the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD interacted with β-chitosan extracellularly, preventing it

342

from binding to ACE2 on the surface of Vero E6 cells. Therefore, β-chitosan plays an

343

important role similar to that of an antibody, neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD

344

and effectively blocking the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2 and preventing

345

infection of the cells.

346

In the human body, ACE is an angiotensin converting enzyme that catalyzes the

347

conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I) to Ang . Ang  plays a crucial role in

348

contracting blood vessels and promoting inflammation through the angiotensin type 1

349

receptor (AT1R). However, ACE2 plays a distinct role from ACE in that it can

350

catalyze the conversion of Ang  to vasodilator angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), which can

351

in turn dilate blood vessels and diminish inflammation through the Mas receptor. Thus,

352

it could be hypothesized that a system formed on the basis of the ACE-Ang -AT1R

353

and ACE2-Ang 1-7-Mas axes maintains the blood pressure homeostasis in the human

354

body20,21. Due to the endocytosis induced by the binding of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2,

355

ACE2 on the surface of cells is almost entirely consumed, causing Ang  levels to

356

increase significantly, leading to a cytokine storm and multiple organ damage7,22.

357

Therefore, once an individual becomes infected by SARS-CoV-2, whether ACE2 is

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.31.229781; this version posted September 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

358

beneficial or detrimental to the individual has become a hotly debated scientific issue.

359

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is one of the leading causes of death for

360

patients infected with COVID-19 and SARS. As a result, the relationship between

361

ARDS and ACE2 has attracted significant attention. Imai 23 found that ARDS lesions

362

in mice with the ACE2 gene knocked out were significantly more severe than those in

363

the control group, while the application of recombinant ACE2 could significantly

364

reduce the occurrence of ARDS in mice, suggesting that ACE2 expression has an

365

obvious protective effect with regard to ARDS in mice. Kuba et al. 24 reported that the

366

expression of ACE2 was down-regulated in vivo and in vitro in the presence of

367

recombinant SARS-CoV-S protein, resulting in pulmonary edema, deterioration in

368

lung function, and ARDS in mice. It has been also reported that ACE2 expression in

369

the myocardium of mice and patients infected with SARS-CoV was decreased

370

significantly7. These findings suggest that ACE2 expression levels are closely related

371

to the severity of SARS lesions. Liu et al. 25 found that Ang  levels in the plasma of

372

COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than those of healthy controls, and

373

moreover, Ang  levels were linearly related to virus titer and the degree of lung

374

injury, indirectly indicating that those phenomena were all induced by decreased

375

ACE2 expression.

376

Native-PAGE analysis demonstrated that ACE2 can be bound by β-chitosan,

377

which prevents the binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD. The IF and FCM results

378

from the cell and animal models revealed that β-chitosan treatment had a significant

379

effect on preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection. WB analyses showed that the expression

380

levels of ACE2 in Vero E6 cells and hACE2 mice infected with the SARS-CoV-2

381

S-RBD were significantly decreased and inflammation responses were also activated.

382

Compared to the individual SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD group, the expression of ACE2 in

383

each group of cells or tissues treated with β-chitosan was significantly decreased,

384

which in turn decreased the inflammatory response driven by the presence of the

385

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD. This is an interesting and important discovery. Based on the

386

known regulatory mechanisms related to ACE2 expression, ACE2 expression is

387

down-regulated as a result of virus binding, which causes internalization and

388

degradation of ACE2. Moreover, the transmembrane protease ADAM17 can cleave

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.31.229781; this version posted September 18, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint

389

the juxtamembrane region of ACE2 and release the active extracellular domain, which

390

can catalyze the degradation of Ang II in the extracellular environment19,26. Thus, this

391

led to speculation with regard to whether there was a mechanism by which β-chitosan,

392

ADAM17, and ACE2 interact to drive an anti-SARS-CoV-2 effect. Accordingly, an

393

ADAM17 inhibitor (TAPI-1) was used to test this hypothesis, and the results

394

indicated that the decreased ACE2 expression level observed in the experimental

395

groups treated with β-chitosan was reversed upon addition of an ADAM17 inhibitor.

396

Compared with the no inhibitor group, the expression of ACE2 was significantly

397

increased (* P < 0.05; * * P < 0.01). This finding suggested that β-chitosan can

398

activate ADAM17 to enhance the cleavage of the extracellular juxtamembrane region

399

of ACE2, releasing the extracellular domain with catalytic activity into the

400

extracellular environment, thus reducing the binding and internalization of

401

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to susceptible cells. Moreover, the cleaved extracellular region

402

of ACE2 retains its catalytic activity and continues to degrade Ang II and prevent

403

inflammation. This discovery that β-chitosan treatment can prevent the binding of the

404

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2 is shown in Fig. 5. Therefore, ADAM17 is a most

405

likely relevant target for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

406

Fig. 5

407

Recently, Waradon Sungnak reported27 that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were highly

408

expressed in nasal goblet cells and ciliated cells that produce mucus. Moreover, the

409

virus concentration in nasal swabs from respiratory disease patients infected by

410

SARS-CoV-2 was higher than that of pharyngeal swabs, suggesting that nasal

411

passages may be a channel for initial infection and transmission of the virus. By

412

administering β-chitosan intranasally, we found that it can be effectively distributed in

413

lung tissue. This result provides a precondition for β-chitosan to block the binding of

414

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2 in vivo. Furthermore, β-chitosan which can be safely

415

degraded, displays good biocompatibility in the brain tissue of rats

416

found that β-chitosan exhibited no toxicity in acute toxicity tests performed with mice

417

and no irritation to the eyes and skin of rabbits29. Thus, delivery of β-chitosan by

418

intravenous injection appears to be safe for humans. In this study, the infection

419

capacity of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and the therapeutic effect of β-chitosan

420

administration were compared using WT and hACE2 mice. The results of these

421

experiments suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD could induce severe

422

inflammation throughout the lungs of hACE2 mice, but there was no similar

423

pathological phenomenon observed in WT mice, which is consistent with the results

424

of Bao’s work30. However, immunofluorescence analysis of tissue samples showed

425

that both lung epithelial cells from both WT and hACE2 mice could bind with

426

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD. The results therefore indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD

427

has different pathogenic effects on WT mice and hACE2 mice, with especially high

428

pathogenicity in the hACE2 host, suggesting that the hACE2 mouse model is an

429

indispensable scientific tool for screening drugs against SARS-CoV-2.

430

In this work, the inhibitory effect of β-chitosan on the binding of the

431

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2 was investigated at three levels (molecular, cellular

432

and animal). The results revealed that β-chitosan treatment can potently block the

433

binding of the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2 and inhibit the occurrence of

434

inflammation. This study presents a promising and important research with a great

435

value and the prospect of application of β-chitosan as a therapy against SARS-CoV-2.

436

With the current epidemic raging, it is time to share our research results in a timely

437

manner and carry out additional studies to improve our collective understanding of

438

this virus.

Binding of β-chitosan with ACE2 or SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD

461

In order to be compatible with the conditions required for HPLC analysis,

462

proteins (SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and ACE2) and β-chitosan were dissolved in a 0.02 M

463

Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH 6.8) in advance. SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD or ACE2 was

464

mixed with a suitable amount of β-chitosan and incubated at 37°C for 20 min. To test

465

the effect of the presence of β-chitosan on the binding of ACE2 to the SARS-CoV-2

466

S-RBD, β-chitosan was added to the co-incubation mixture containing ACE2 and

SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and incubated together in a similar manner. The sample

468

mixtures were then analyzed by Native-PAGE and SEC-HPLC. The amounts of

Fig. 5 Mechanism for β-chitosan-mediated inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 binding.
-β-chitosan: control group for testing SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 binding. SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into host
cells via the binding and internalization of ACE2 in a clathrin-dependent manner. Thus, the levels of the extracellular
juxtamembrane region of ACE2, which can catalyze the degradation of Ang II, are decreased, resulting in increased
Ang II levels and elevated blood pressure19. Moreover, ADAM17 cleaves few extracellular domain of ACE2.
Meanwhile, the NF-κB and JNK signaling pathways are activated along with some related-inflammatory pathways.
The arrowheads indicate the proposed process. The “T” shaped arrows represent an inhibitory effect.
+β-chitosan: treatment group for testing SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD/ACE2 binding. In the presence of β-chitosan,
SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and ACE2 are bound and shielded by β-chitosan, which blocks the binding and subsequent
internalization of SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD to ACE2. ADAM17 is activated by β-chitosan to enhance the cleavage of
the extracellular domain of ACE2. The active ectodomain of ACE2 remains catalytically active and degrades Ang
II, thus promoting maintenance of a stable blood pressure. In addition, the NF-κB and JNK signaling pathways are
also inhibited.
