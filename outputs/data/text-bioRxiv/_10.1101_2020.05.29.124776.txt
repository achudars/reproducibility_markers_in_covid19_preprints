Abstract

20

Serology testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is

21

increasingly being used during the current pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

22

The clinical and epidemiologic utilities of antibody-based SARS-CoV-2 testing are under debate.

23

Characterizing these assays helps to understand the disease and provides scientific basis for

24

deciding how to best use these assays. The study assessed one chemiluminescent assay (Abbott

25

COVID-2 IgG) and two lateral flow assays (STANDARD Q [SQ] IgM/IgG Duo and Wondfo Total

26

Antibody Test). Validation included 113 blood samples from 71 PCR-confirmed COVID-19

27

patients and 1182 samples from negative controls with potential interferences/cross-reactions,

28

including 1063 pre-pandemic samples. IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected as

29

early as post-symptom onset days 3-4. IgG antibodies were first detected post-onset days 5-6

30

by SQ assays. The detection rates increased gradually, and SQ IgG, Abbott IgG and Wondfo

31

Total detected antibodies from all the PCR-confirmed patients 14 days after symptom onset.

32

Overall agreements between SQ IgM/IgG and Wondfo Total was 88.5% and between SQ IgG

33

and Abbott IgG was 94.6% (Kappa = 0.75, 0.89).

34

coronavirus infections were identified. Viral hepatitis and autoimmune samples were the main

35

cross-reactions observed. However, the interferences/cross-reactions were low. The

36

specificities were 100% for SQ IgG and Wondfo Total and 99.62% for Abbott IgG and 98.87% for

37

SQ IgM. These findings demonstrate high sensitivity and specificity of appropriately validated

38

antibody-based SARS-CoV-2 assays with implications for clinical use and epidemiological

39

seroprevalence studies.

Introduction

41
42

There is an ongoing worldwide pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus, now known as

43

SARS-CoV-2. The virus was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province of China in 2019.

44

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has greatly impacted

45

many countries, most especially the United States. There are currently over 5 million confirmed

46

cases

47

(https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). Evaluating the spread and transmission of SARS-Cov-2

48

is critical in addressing the pandemic.

49

with

over

patients

in

the

United

States

Development of diagnostic methods for COVID-19 started with SARS-CoV-2 viral

50

genome sequencing first shared by a group of Chinese scientists (1).

Real-time reverse

51

transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) based methods have been the mainstay as a

52

diagnostic approach. Most tests use the nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs to obtain

53

the virus before running rRT-PCR. However, it was quickly discovered that the detection rates of

54

pharyngeal and nasal swabs were only 32% and 63%, respectively, and their detection rates

55

decreased as the disease progressed (2). First-time positive rate by pharyngeal swab rRT-PCR

56

was reported as low as 37% in 610 hospitalized patients (3).

57

While rRT-PCR-based testing is the main tool for clinical diagnosis, antibody-based

58

testing has gained considerable attention. Studies suggested that IgM antibody might develop

59

as early as five days after onset of symptoms (4) and IgG developed later at a median time of 14

60

days (4, 5). The sensitivities of these tests reportedly varies widely from as low as 11% early in

61

infection (6) to as high as 100% after 14 days (5). It has been shown that diagnosis of COVID-19

62

could potentially be improved by using both PCR-based and antibody-based tests (5). However,

63

the most important use of antibody-based tests is seroprevalence studies for use in modeling

64

methods and understanding how SARS-CoV-2 has spread across different populations.

65

Many antibody-based SARS-CoV-2 tests are currently available or in development.

66

Antibodies to the Spike protein (S-protein), receptor binding domain (in S-protein) and

67

nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) are the main targets of these assays. It has been

68

demonstrated that N-protein-based antibody tests were more sensitive than antibody tests

69

targeting

70

immunochromatographic assays using a lateral flow format. Lateral flow assays use venous

71

blood or capillary blood and they are a manual test that are quick and easy to perform,

72

independent of larger immunochemical instruments. The majority of tests detect IgM and IgG

73

separately while some detect total antibodies (IgM and IgG). Positive results demonstrate a

74

visible band with various degrees of intensity in a designated zone. Chemiluminescent tests are

75

considered the most sensitive by methodology and provided results with great accuracy and

76

precision. These tests are commonly quick and randomly accessible on immunochemical

77

analyzers. The current study looks to the performance of two lateral flow assays and one

chemiluminescent assay testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Methods

81
82

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Lifespan Health

83

System (including Rhode Island Hospital and The Miriam Hospital) to ensure the study met the

84

ethical requirements.

85
86

Patients

87

A total of 113 remnant/discarded serum or plasma samples were collected from March

88

to April in 2020 from the Clinical Immunology Lab at a major academic pathology department in

89

Rhode Island. These samples were collected from 71 COVID-19 patients confirmed by rRT-PCR

90

tests on nasopharyngeal swabs. An additional 126 samples were collected from healthy

91

individuals in early March. 119 samples that were positive for antibodies against viruses and

92

other pathogens were used to test cross-reaction of the assays (Table3). Additional samples

93

were collected consisting of interference antibodies such as Rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-

94

double strand DNA (ds-DNA), anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) and paraprotein IgM and IgG (Table

95

3). Blood samples from patients testing positive for upper respiratory viruses were obtained

96

when a viral respiratory pathogen nucleic acid test was performed (ePlex Respiratory Pathogen

97

Panel, GenMark, Carlsbad, CA), or up to 53 days after the diagnoses. The same upper

98

respiratory virus tests were routinely ordered for all the COVID-19 patients. The tests were

99

performed following manufacturer’s protocol.

100

Of all the 113 samples available from the 71 patients, 105 samples were selected to

101

evaluate antibody positive rates every two days (1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, 9-10, 11-12, 13-14, and ≥ 15

102

days post symptom onset). Duplicate samples in the same time frame were not used.

103

Seroconversion date was defined as the middle point between the date of the last negative and

104

the date of the first positive in one patient.

105

To obtain more precise specificities for SQ IgM, SQ IgG and Abbott IgG, 1063 serum or

106

plasma samples were collected before the pandemic started in the United States (January

107

2020), including 500 samples originally for reference range determination of a troponin assay,

108

371 prenatal samples for reference range determination of quadruple tests, 50 pre-pandemic

109

samples from transfusion service and 21 pre-pandemic plasma segments from the Rhode Island

110

Blood Center.

111

Not all the samples were available for all four tests. Case numbers in the tables and

112

figures may have small difference (up to 4); however, the results and conclusions were not

113

compromised.

114
115

Lateral flow assays

116

SARS-CoV-2 Total Antibody Test (Wondfo, Guangzhou, China) and STANDARD Q COVID-

117

19 IgM/IgG Duo Test kits (SD Biosensor, Gyeonggi-do, Korea) were purchased from the

118

manufacturers and the assays were performed following the manufacturer’s protocols (8, 9).

119

Briefly, 10 µl of serum or plasma was applied to the designated area of the lateral flow strip

120

following three drops of buffer. Positive result was indicated by a visible band in the designated

121

area accompanied with an appropriate control band. Over 90% of the reading was performed

122

by one investigator (K.J.P.) to ensure consistency.

124

Chemiluminescent assay

125

SARS-CoV-2 IgG test reagents were purchased from the manufacturer (Abbott

126

Diagnostics, Lake Forest, IL). The assays were performed on an Abbott Architect i1000 analyzer

127

following the manufacturer’s protocol. The assay was calibrated initially and with any

128

subsequent reagent lot. A positive and negative Control was run at the start of each batch of

129

antibody testing per manufacturers protocol (10). Serum and plasma samples were both

130

accepted by the assay. Samples with signal-to-cutoff (S/CO) ratio greater than or equal to 1.4

131

were considered positive.

132
133

Data analysis

134

The data collected were analyzed on a statistical package, JMP Pro 14.0 (SAS Institute,

135

Cary, NC). Categorical data were analyzed via Chi-square analysis or Fisher’s exact test

136

whenever appropriate. Wilcoxon method was used in parametric test. 95% confidence intervals

137

were calculated for the sensitivity and specificity.

Results

139

Clinicopathologic features of COVID-19 patients in the study

140

Table 1 summarizes the clinicopathologic features of 71 PCR-confirmed COVID-19

141

patients in this series, including 42 males and 29 females. Average age of the males was 8.1

142

years younger than that of the females (P=0.0470). About one third (38) of the patients were

143

White or Caucasian and 31% (22) were Hispanic or Latino. Africa Americans consisted of 14%

144

(10) of the patients. There was one Asian patient. Many of the patients were either overweight

145

(30%) or obese (47%). Most of them 48 (68%) lived with family members, 9 (13%) in assisted

146

facilities, 9 (13%) alone, and 5 (7%) were homeless. Forty percent (40%) of them had diabetes.

147

Only 8 (11%) had baseline respiratory illnesses, mainly asthma and/or chronic obstructive

148

pulmonary disease (COPD). Eight (11%) had positive findings in upper respiratory virus testing

149

(ePlex Respiratory Pathogen Panel), including coronavirus NL63, coronavirus OC43, and

150

rhinovirus/enterovirus, influenza A subtype H1N1, and respiratory syncytial virus A and B.

151

Patients had decreased absolute lymphocyte count at 0.71x109/L on average when the

152

diagnosis of COVID-19 was made. The highest D-Dimer level in the disease course was

153

significantly higher in male patients, with median of 2180 ng/mL, compared to 431 in female

154

patients (P=0.0289; P= 0.0099 after logarithmic transformation). Among the highest level of

155

oxygen requirement in the disease course, 32 (45%) needed oxygen through nasal cannula, 19

156

(27%) required intubation, 1 needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and the remaining

157

17 (26%) maintained a satisfactory oxygen saturation on room air. Seven patients died including

158

6 males and 1 female.

161

Antibody detection in early disease stages by four different tests
The patients’ blood samples were collected on average 11.2 days post-symptom onset

162

(Table 1). The samples were grouped every two days within the first 2 weeks starting on the

163

symptom onset day 0, and tested by SQ IgM, SQ IgG, Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total antibody

164

assays. Positive results appeared as early as days 3-4 for SQ IgM, days 5-6 for SQ IgG, days 7-8

165

for Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total. After 14 days, all the samples were positive by SQ IgG, Abbott

166

IgG and Wondfo Total.

167

The time points and test results related to seroconversion are listed in Supplemental

168

Table 1. Twenty-three events of seroconversion were recorded and summarized in Figure 2. SQ

169

IgM recorded 7 seroconversions, dated from post-symptom onset days 5.5 to 11, 7.9 days on

170

average. SQ IgG recorded 8 seroconversions, dated from post-symptom onset days 5.5 to 10,

171

7.6 days on average. Abbott IgG recorded 8 seroconversions, dated from post-symptom onset

172

days 5.5 to 10.5, 7.6 days on average. Wondfo Total Antibodies recorded 10 seroconversions,

173

dating from 5.5 to 11 days, 8.1 days on average. There was no statistical difference among the

174

seroconversion times of all the assays (Figure 2).

175
176
177

Comparison between IgG assays and IgM/IgG assays
The Wondfo Total Antibody test detects IgG and IgM. Either a positive IgM or a positive

178

IgG will give a positive result. SQ IgM/IgG Duo is packaged as two independent lateral flow

179

devices that are used to assay IgM and IgG in parallel, but their combined interpretation

180

provides a result comparable with that of the Wondfo Total Antibody test. Out of 113 samples

181

from PCR-confirmed patients with antibody results available from all 3 tests, 65 (58%) were

182

positive by Wondfo Total and SQ IgM/IgG and 35 (31%) were negative by all three. Six (5.3%)

183

were positive by Wondfo and negative by SQ IgM and IgG. Seven (6.2%) were negative by

184

Wondfo Total and positive by either of SQ IgM and IgG. The overall agreement was 88.5% and

185

the Kappa value was 0.75. (Table 2)

186

Between SQ IgG and Abbott IgG, the overall agreement was 94.6% with a Kappa value of

187

0.89. There were 58 (52%) samples positive by both assays and 48 (43%) negative by both. Five

188

(4.5%) were positive by Abbott IgG and negative by SQ IgG. Of these, 4 were positive by

189

Wondfo Total. One (1%) case was positive by SQ IgG but negative by Abbott IgG and Wondfo

190

Total. (Table 2)

191
192
193

Cross-reactions, interference and specificities
To obtain the specificities of four tests, 126 assumedly negative samples collected from

194

routine clinical immunology samples were tested. All resulted negative except SQ IgM which

195

had three positives. The specificities and 95% confidence intervals of SQ IgG, Abbott IgG and

196

Wondfo Total were 100% (97.0%, 100%) for all three and 97.6% (93.2%, 99.2%) for SQ IgM

197

based on this series. (Table 3)

198

To examine the assay’s cross-reactivity to other viruses, the study included 21 samples

199

from patients with seasonal coronavirus NL63 (n=11), HKU1 (n=7) and 229E (n=3). The

200

diagnoses of virus infection were based on nucleic acid testing. No patients with past OC43

201

infection were evaluated. Blood samples were collected around the diagnoses and after the

202

diagnoses to ensure enough antibody response to be mounted. Eight samples were collected

203

14 to 53 days after the diagnosis. All 21 samples were negative by the four tests. Similar

210

with CMV IgM and one sample with Hepatitis A IgG. Abbott IgG was positive in one sample with

211

Hepatitis A IgG and one sample from an active Hepatitis B patient. Wondfo Total was positive in

212

one sample from a patient with both active Hepatitis B and C. SQ IgM was positive in one

213

sample with Toxoplasma IgM. None of Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) samples was positive by any

214

of the tests. (Table 3)

215

SQ IgM was positive in one sample with Rheumatoid Factor (RF) and Abbott IgG was

216

positive in one sample with RF and one sample with anti-Double Strand DNA (dsDNA). (Table 3)

Discussion

229

The utility of the COVID-19 serology testing is still subject to debate. As shown in Figure

230

1, antibodies started to be detected 3-4 days after the symptom onset. Antibody titers

231

continued to increase and after 2 weeks antibodies could be detected by all the tests except SQ

232

IgM whose positive rate peaked at 87.5% around day 13-14. High sensitivity of serology testing

233

after 2 weeks of symptom onset was shown in other studies (11, 12). In one study, 100%

234

sensitivity was seen in Diazyme IgM/IgG assay ≥ 15 days post PCR diagnosis (11) and another

235

study reported 93.8% (95% CI; 82.80-98.69) at ≥14d post symptom onset for Abbott IgG (12).

236

Serology testing could be used as part of the diagnostic panel after 14 days post

237

symptom onset when the positive rates were the highest and the sensitivity of swab PCR

238

decreased (2, 3). At our institution, it is not uncommon to see patients who were highly

239

suspected of COVID-19 based on signs and symptoms have positive antibody tests while rRT-

240

PCR tests were repeatedly negative. The seroconversion could be detected during the second

241

week post symptom onset (Figure 2). Presence of a seroconversion in a highly suspicious

242

COVID-19 patient should be diagnostic in the right clinical settings. The utility of the testing

243

before 2 weeks post symptom onset should be best decided on a case-by-case basis.

244

The overall agreement between SQ IgM/IgG and Wondfo Total was as high as 88.5%

245

with Kappa of 0.75. The overall agreement between Abbott IgG and SQ IgG was as high as 94.6%

246

with Kappa of 0.89. The disagreement cases were samples collected during the first 2 weeks of

247

symptoms. Since the tests were generally not recommended before 2 weeks post symptom

248

onset, the difference among the assays would not be clinically significant.

250

Specificities and cross-reactions of all four tests

251

It has been widely considered that the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may be cross-reactive to

252

seasonal coronaviruses, such as NL63, 229E, HKU1, and OC43. The latter two belong to beta

253

subgroup which also includes SARS-CoV-2. The detection of non-COVID coronaviruses varies

254

from year to year and in some years accounted for as much as 22%-25% of adult respiratory

255

illness (13, 14). Therefore, if cross reactivity did exist, the utility of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody test

256

would be greatly limited. In the current study, among the 21 samples from patients with

257

coronaviruses NL63, HKU1 and 229E, 13 were collected at the time of diagnosis and 8 collected

258

at least 2 weeks after the diagnosis to ensure sufficient development of immune response. All

259

four tests performed well and none of them were reactive to the 21 samples in the study.

260

Consistent with our findings, one study included 5 seasonal coronavirus samples and they were

261

all negative by Abbott IgG (12). Seasonal coronaviruses are known for their short periods of

262

immunity after infection. It is known that antibodies against seasonal coronaviruses reached

263

peak titers in 2 weeks and slowly declined and the protection is largely lost a year later (15);

264

however, due to repeat infection, a report found that adult population had a high

265

seroprevalence of coronaviruses (91.3% for 229E, 59.2% for HKU1, 91.8% for NL63, and 90.8%

266

for OC43) from a United States Metropolitan Population (11). In the current study we included

267

over 1000 samples from pre-pandemic era and overall found very low positive rates in SQ IgM,

268

SQ IgG and Abbott IgG, which echoes the findings from Abbott (10) and an independent study

269

(16). The Wondfo Total was not tested in this evaluation. Given the high prevalence of

270

coronavirus infection in the general population (11), if the cross-reactions were common, the

271

positive rates would be expected to be higher.

272

The cross-reaction in hepatitis patients was unexpected. Out of 15 samples with

273

hepatitis A, B or C, one sample with Hepatitis A IgG was positive in both the SQ IgG and Abbott

274

tests. One sample with active Hepatitis B was positive by the Abbott IgG test. One sample with

275

active Hepatitis B and C was positive by Wondfo test. It is difficult to determine which hepatitis

276

antibody was indeed cross-reactive because all these samples were expected positive for

277

Hepatitis A IgG and Hepatitis B surface antibodies.

278

Autoimmune antibodies are known interferences of many antibody tests. SQ IgM and

279

Abbott IgG tests were reactive to a RF positive sample and Abbott IgG test was reactive to an

280

anti-dsDNA positive sample. Special attention should be paid to autoimmune patients when

281

interpreting their positive SARS-COVID-2 antibody results.

282
283

The clinical usefulness of IgM testing

284

The utility of SARS-COVID-2 IgM testing has not been fully evaluated. Reported

285

specificities of IgM have been suboptimal: only 2 out of 9 tested assays achieved > 95% at the

286

lower end of 95% confidence interval of their specificities (17). However, given the facts that SQ

287

IgM detected IgM only 2 days before SQ IgG detected IgG and that SQ IgM positive rate was

288

only 85.7% in samples over 2 weeks post symptom onset, SQ IgM has marked limit in its clinical

289

utility.

290
291
292
293

Use of the antibody testing in community survey
Serologic testing has been used in seroprevalence surveys, including a large-scale
geographic survey (18), a community level survey (19), and a special populations survey (20).
15

available under aCC-BY-ND 4.0 International license.

294

The key assay characteristic that impacts the accuracy of these surveys is specificity, especially

295

when the disease prevalence is low. It is estimated that for an assay with 99% specificity, the

296

positive predictive value is only ~50% in a disease with prevalence of 1%. The SQ IgG and

297

Abbott IgG reached over 99% specificities at the lower ends of their 95% confidence intervals.

298

The SQ IgG was negative in all the 1063 negative cases, with 99.64% specificity at the lower end

299

of its 95% confidence interval. Even with 99.64% specificity, the positive predictive value

300

increases to 74% in a disease with prevalence of 1%, and the positive predictive value increases

301

to 93% in a disease with prevalence of 5%.

302
303
304

Limitation of the study
The main limitation of the study is that the samples from COVID-19 patients were

305

collected from an inpatient population. This group of patients were generally overweight or

306

obese (77%) with high prevalence of diabetes (40%). They tended to have a high D-Dimer levels

307

and marked lymphocytopenia. The clinical symptoms tended to be severe with more being

308

intubated and poor clinical outcomes. The antibody response in this population has been

309

shown to be robust (17). In outpatient population, asymptomatic infected individuals have

310

been reported only with ~ 10% (28/276) seropositive rates (20). Moreover, asymptomatic and

311

pauci-symptomatic patients could have no detectable antibody response 4 weeks after the

312

diagnosis (21). Another limitation is the limited number of non-COVID positive samples

313

collected at least 2 weeks post symptom onset. More work is needed to assess these tests in

314

this patient population.

available under aCC-BY-ND 4.0 International license.

315

Another important question in COVID-19 serology is how long the antibody response

316

will persist. The three samples collected over 30 days post symptom onset had Abbott S/CO

317

reading of 7.58 (31 days), 6.37 (31 days) and 2.43 (35 days). The last one was from a patient

318

with end stage renal disease which is known for its attenuated immune response. The other

319

two were among the most robust immune responses in this cohort (both over 90% quantile of

320

S/CO readings). Obviously, follow-up testing of these patients’ antibody S/CO levels will help to

321

answer the question.

322

In summary, we validated three SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests, including two lateral flow

323

assays (Wondfo Total Antibody and SQ IgM/IgG combo) and one chemiluminescent assay

324

(Abbott IgG). All tests except SQ IgM performed well with excellent sensitivities two weeks after

325

symptom onset and excellent overall specificities. Hepatitis and autoimmune samples were the

326

main sources of very low interferences/cross-reactions.
