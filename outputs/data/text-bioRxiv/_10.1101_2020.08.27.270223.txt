Abstract
We examined a novel function of mammalian Choline-Transporter-Like proteins CTL1/SLC44A1
and CTL2/SLC44A2 in ethanolamine transport. We established two distinct ethanolamine
transport systems of a high affinity (K1 = 55.6 - 66.5 µM), mediated by CTL1, and of a low affinity
(K2 = 275 - 299 µM), mediated by CTL2. Both types of transport are Na+-independent and
mediated in a pH dependent manner, as expected for ethanolamine/H+ antiporters. Primary human
fibroblasts with separate frameshift mutations (M1= SLC44A1 ΔAsp517 and M2= SLC44A1 ΔSer126)
are devoid of CTL1 ethanolamine transport but maintain unaffected CTL2 transport. The lack of
CTL1 or CTL2 reduced the ethanolamine transport, the flux by the CDP-ethanolamine Kennedy
pathway and PE synthesis. Overexpression of CTL1 in SLC44A1 ΔSer126 (M2) cells improved the
ethanolamine transport and PE synthesis. The SLC44A1 ΔSer126 cells are reliant on CTL2 function
and CTL2 siRNA almost completely abolished ethanolamine transport in the whole cells and
mitochondria. Overexpression of CTL1 and CTL2 cDNAs increased ethanolamine transport in
control and SLC44A1ΔSer126 cells. CTL1 and CTL2 facilitated mitochondrial ethanolamine uptake,
but the transport mediated by CTL1 is predominant in the whole cells and mitochondria. These
data firmly established that CTL1 and CTL2 are the first identified ethanolamine transporters in
the whole cells and mitochondria, with intrinsic roles in de novo PE synthesis by the CDP-Etn
Kennedy pathway and compartmentation of intracellular ethanolamine.
Significance
The lack of Choline Transporter Like 1 (SLC44A1/CTL1) is the primary cause of a new
neurodegenerative disorder with elements of childhood-onset parkinsonism and mitochondrial
dysfunction. SLC44A2/CTL2 encodes the human neutrophil antigen 3, causes autoimmune hearing
loss and Meniere’s disease, and has been recently identified as the main risk factor for thrombosisthe major cause of death in Covid-19 patients. Our investigation provides insights into the novel
functions of CTL1 and CTL2 as intrinsic ethanolamine transporters. CTL1 and CTL2 are high and
low affinity transporters, with direct roles in the membrane phospholipid synthesis. The work
contributes to new knowledge for CTL1 and CTL2 independent transport functions and the
optimization of prevention and treatment strategies in those various diseases.

Introduction
Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are major components of cellular
membranes where they are involved with essential cellular processes (1, 2). PC and PE are
synthesized de novo by CDP-Cho and CDP-Etn branches of the Kennedy pathway in which the
extracellular substrates choline (Cho) and ethanolamine (Etn) are actively transported into the cell,
phosphorylated and coupled with diacylglycerols (DAG) to form the final phospholipid product.
While multiple transport systems have been established for Cho, Etn transport is poorly
characterized and there is no single gene/protein assigned a transport function for mammalian Etn.
Cho transport for membrane phospholipid synthesis is mediated by Cho transporter like protein
CTL1/SLC44A1 (3). CTL1 is the only well-characterized member of a broader family (CTL15/SLC44A1-5) (4, 5). CTL1/SLC44A1 is a Cho/H+ antiporter at the plasma membrane and
mitochondria (4, 5). The role of plasma membrane CTL1 is assigned to Cho transport for PC
synthesis, but the exact function of the mitochondrial CTL1 is still not clear. In the liver and
kidney, mitochondrial CTL1 transports Cho for oxidation to betaine, the major methyl donor in
the one-carbon cycle (6). In other tissues however, the mitochondrial CTL1 probably maintains
the intracellular pools of Cho and as a H+-antiporter and modulates the electrochemical/proton
gradient in the mitochondria (7, 8). CTL2/SLC44A2 is only indirectly implicated in PC synthesis
and its exact function is not firmly established in neither whole cells nor mitochondria (4).
PE is the major inner membrane phospholipid with specific roles in mitochondrial fusion,
autophagy and apoptosis (9 - 11). PE is also a valuable source of other phospholipids. PC is
produced by methylation of PE while phosphatidylserine (PS) is produced by an exchange
mechanism whereby the Etn moiety of PE is replaced with serine and free Etn is released. PC
could also produce PS by a similar exchange mechanism, with free Cho being released. The
metabolically released Cho and Etn need to be transported in and out of the cytosol and
mitochondria or reincorporated into the Kennedy pathway (3 - 6). That mammalian Etn and Cho
transport may occur through a similar transport system was implicated from early kinetic studies
in bovine endothelial cells, human retinoblastoma cells and glial cells (12 - 14). Here, we
demonstrate that CTL1/SLC44A1 and CTL2/SLC44A2 are authentic Etn transporters at the cell
surface and mitochondria. We examine the kinetics of Etn transport in CTL1 and CTL2 depleted
conditions and overexpressing cells. We characterize Etn transport in human skin fibroblasts that

maintain CTL2 but lack CTL1 function due to inherited CTL1/SLC44A1 frameshift mutations
(M1= SLC44A1 ΔAsp517 and M2= SLC44A1 ΔSer126) (15). We employ pharmacological and antibody
induced inhibition to separate the contributions of the CTL1 and CTL2 to Etn transport and PE
synthesis. This study is the first to demonstrate that the CTL1 and CTL2 are high and low to
medium affinity cellular and mitochondrial Etn transporters. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to demonstrate that as intrinsic Etn transporters, CTL1 and CTL2 regulate the supply of
extracellular Etn for the CDP-Etn pathway, redistribute intracellular Etn and balance CDP-Cho
and CDP-Etn arms of the Kennedy pathway.

Results
CTL1 and CTL2 inhibition reduces Etn and Cho transport
To assess the magnitude by which CTL1/2 inhibition affects PE and PC levels, two types of cells
were characterized for phospholipid metabolism (MCF-7 and MCF-10) (16, 17). The cells were
treated for 24h with [3H]-glycerol, to label the entire glycerolipid pools (steady-state levels) in the
presence and absence of CTL1 transport inhibitor hemicholinium-3 (HC-3) or CTL1 specific
antibody (Fig. 1A and B). Surprisingly, HC-3 reduced the steady-state levels not only of PC (2550%) but also of PE (50%) in both cell types. CTL1 antibody similarly reduced PC and PE levels
(40-50%), further indicating that CTL1 could be involved in the transport of Etn, in addition to its
well-characterized function in Cho transport (15, 18). [3H]-Cho and [14C]-Etn transport were
similarly inhibited with the CTL1 inhibitor HC-3 (Fig. 1C) and they compete for the same transport
system (Fig. 1D). [14C]-Etn and [3H]-Cho transport were similarly diminished when equal, 200
µM, Etn, Cho and Etn + Cho were applied respectively (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, CTL1 antibody
inhibited 14C-Etn transport in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 50 ng (Fig. 1E).
CTL2 antibody also inhibited both, 14C-Etn and 3H-Cho transports in a concentration dependent
manner with LC50 50 ng (Fig. 1F, G). Together, the data showed that Etn is a 3ubstrate for CTL1
and CTL2-mediated transports, in addition to already establish functions in Cho transport.
CTL1 is a high-affinity and CTL2 is a low-affinity Etn transporter
We studied the kinetics of Etn transport in monkey COS-7 cells and control (Ctrl) and CTL1
deficient (M1=SLC44A1ΔAsp517 and M2=SLC44A1Ser126) primary human fibroblasts. As expected,
COS-7 cells and Ctrl fibroblasts expressed CTL1 and CTL2 proteins while CTL1 mutant
fibroblasts M1 and M2 only expressed CTL2 protein (Fig. 2A). 14C-Etn transport rates (V) plotted
against [Etn] produced a series of saturation curves, as expected for protein mediated transports
(Fig. 2B). Vmax values were nearly identical in Ctrl and COS-7 cells (Vmax = 26.9 and 26.3 nmol/mg
protein/min) and M1 and M2 cells had reduced but similar Vmax = 20.6 - 21.2 nmol/mg protein/min
(Fig. 2B), apparently caused by the absence of the CTL1 transport component. Indeed, the EadieHofstee plots derived from the saturation curves were biphasic in Ctrl fibroblasts and COS-7 cells
and linear for M1 and M2 cells (Fig. 2C). This type of behavior indicated the presence of two
distinct transport systems in Ctrl and COS-7 cells with two binding constants, of high and low

affinity for Etn, and one transport system of a lower affinity in M1 and M2 cells. As further shown
in Fig. 2C, Ctrl fibroblasts, high affinity (K1 = 66.5 ± 8.5 µM) and low (K2 = 299.0 ± 13.1 µM)
affinity Etn bindings were similar to COS-7 cells bindings (K1 = 55.6 ± 14.8 µM and K2 = 277.3 ±
7.9 µM). On the other hand, M1 and M2 cells are characterized by a single transport with a binding
constant for Etn of 275.4 – 279.6 µM which is the second (K2), low affinity, binding constant as
determined in Ctrl and COS-7 cells (Fig. 2C). M1 and M2 cells only express CTL2 and at levels
similar to Ctrl and Cos 7 cells, and do not have a functional CTL1 protein (Fig. 2A,D), strongly
implicating CTL2 as responsible for the low affinity Etn transport. Indeed, CTL2 depletion by
siRNA knockdown in Ctrl cells completely abolished the low affinity transport component while
the high affinity component remained intact (Fig. 2E). This analysis also confirmed that the high
affinity transport (K1) which is absent in M1 and M2 cells and remained intact in CTL2 siRNA
treated Ctrl is CTL1-mediated Etn transport.
Since the effects of pH and [Na+] ions on choline transport is well established (19), their
effects on Etn transport were also investigated (Fig. 2F and G). Etn transport in Ctrl (CTL1 +
CTL2 transport) and M2 fibroblasts (CTL2 transport) (Fig. 2F) was reduced when extracellular
pH was lowered from 7 to 5.5 and stimulated when pH was increased to 8.5. Additionally (Fig.
2G), as expected, the rate of Etn transport in Ctrl cells was higher than in M2 cells but the rates
were not modified when Na+ ions were replaced by Li+ ions in the uptake buffer. Altogether, the
data established that CTL1 and CTL2 acts as Etn/H+ antiporters, driven by a proton gradient and
they are both independent of Na+, as in case of Cho transport (19).
CDP-Etn Kennedy pathway is down regulated by CTL1 deficiency
Since this is the first time that Etn transporters are identified, it is important to establish if they are
functionally linked to the CDP-Etn Kennedy pathway for PE synthesis. We performed pulse
(synthesis) and pulse-chase (degradation) radiolabeling with [14C]Etn in Ctrl and CTL1 deficient
M2 cells, to establish the contributions of total and CTL2 transport to the CDP-Etn Kennedy
pathway (Fig. 3A,B). As shown in (Fig. 3A), the total incorporation of [14C]Etn and the rates of
synthesis (slopes) of the pathway intermediates phospho-Etn (P-Etn), CDP-Etn and the final
product PE were lower in M2 cells than in Ctrl cells. Similarly reduced was the [14C]Etn
incorporation and P-Etn and CDP-Etn disappearance in M2 cells in the pulse-chase experiments
(Fig. 3B). In addition, the [3H]glycerol radiolabeling of glycerolipid equilibrium pools (the steady15

state levels) showed unchanged PC, reduced PE, PS and DAG and increased triglycerides (TAG)
in M2 cells (Fig. 3C and D). Therefore, reduced Etn transport, slower P-Etn and CDP-Etn
formation, and reduced DAG levels, collectively slowed the CDP-Etn pathway (Fig. 3A,B) and
reduced PE levels (Fig. 3C) in M2 cells.
The CDP-Etn formation from PEtn is usually the rate-regulatory step in the Kennedy
pathway and is controlled by Pcyt2 (CTP: phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase) (11).
Indeed, in accordance with reduced CDP-Etn formation above, the activity and expression of Pcyt2
were also reduced in M2 cells (Fig. 3 E,F). The expression of Etn kinase (EK) was similarly
decreased by 25% (Fig. 3F), explaining why the formation of P-Etn was reduced in M2 cells (Fig.
3A, B). In addition to PE, PS levels were reduced in M2 cells but the expression of PS synthesis
(PS syntase1/2-PSS1/2) and PS degradation (PS decarboxylase-PSD) genes (Fig.3F) were
unaltered (Fig 3C). The expression of the PC synthesis genes Pcyt1 (CTP: phosphocholine
cytidylyltransferase) was decreased by 70% and choline kinase (CK) by 25% in M2 cells (Fig.
3F), yet unexpectedly PC levels were unchanged (Fig. 3C). We previously established (15) that
the constant PC levels in CTL1 deficient M1 and M2 cells are maintained by reduced PC turnover
and increased formation from other phospholipids (PC is made at the expanse of PE and PS), as
the main mechanism to maintain PC as a source of choline in a new neurodegenerative disorder
caused by frame-shift mutations in the CTL1 gene M1=SLC44A1ΔAsp517 and M2=SLC44A21Ser126
(15). These data collectively provided strong genetic and metabolic evidence that CTL1 and CTL2
independently contributes not only to the CDP-Cho but also to the CDP-Etn Kennedy pathway.
CTL2 is not over expressed in deficient M1 and M2 cells (Fig.2A) and as such it cannot
compensate for the absence of CTL1 in those cells and affected individuals (15).
Overexpressed CTL1 and CTL2 participate in choline and ethanolamine transport
To demonstrate that CTL1 and CTL2 are both Etn and Cho transporters, the cells were transiently
transfected with CTL1 cDNA or CTL2 cDNA and the protein expression and transport determined
after 48h. As shown in Fig. 4A, in M2 cells, that completely lack CTL1 protein, CTL1 cDNA
increased CTL1 protein to the levels in Ctrl cells. In Ctrl cells, that have abundant CTL1 and CTL2,
transfections only modestly increased the protein levels. On the other hand, when cells were treated
with CTL2 siRNA the treatment almost completely abolished CTL2 protein in both cells, which
diminished the low affinity Etn transport, described in Fig 2E.

CTL1 cDNA increased Etn transport by 100% and CTL2 cDNA increased Etn transport 25% in
M2 cells 48h post transfection (Fig. 4B). In Ctrl cells, CTL1 cDNA increased Cho (Fig. 4C, upper
panel) and Etn (Fig. 4D upper panel) transport by 50% and 25% respectively. CTL2 cDNA
similarly increased Cho and Etn transport by 25% (Fig. 4C,D-lower panels). Overall, the
overexpression data corroborated the kinetic data in Figs 1 and 2 and showed that CTL1 and CTL2
promote transport with similar affinities for Cho and Etn, further showing their functional
connection with both arms of the Kennedy pathway.
Overexpressed CTL1 facilitates CDP-Etn Kennedy pathway in deficient cells
To establish if the overexpression of CTL1 in mutant cells can facilitate CDP-Etn Kennedy
pathway, CTL1 cDNA transfected (M2+CTL1) and CTL1 deficient (M2) cells were monitored
with [14C]Etn radiolabeling in pulse (Fig. 4E) and pulse-chase (Fig. 4F) experiments. As expected,
the incorporation of the [14C] in Etn, CDP-Etn and PE was significantly increased in CTL1 cDNA
transfected relative to untransfected M2 cells. Both types of labelling experiments showed
increased P-Etn and CDP-Etn degradation and increased PE synthesis and turnover in M2
transfected cells. Overall, these data demonstrated that the stimulated Etn transport by CTL1
expression increased the flux through the CDP-Etn pathway in CTL1 deficient cells.
Pharmacological and siRNA inhibition of Etn transport
It is well known that various organic cations can inhibit CTL1 mediated Cho transport (20). We
assessed the inhibitory effect of organic cations and CTL2 knockdown on Etn transport in Ctrl and
M2 cells (Fig. 5). This helped us understand the magnitude at which CTL1 and CTL2 contributed
to Etn transport. Total (CTL1+CTL2) transport (Fig. 5A, Ctrl cells), CTL1 mediated transport
(Fig. 5B, Ctrl+CTL2 siRNA cells), CTL2-mediated transport (Fig. 5C, M2 cells) and residual,
CTL1 and CTL2 independent transport (Fig. 5D M2 + CTL2 siRNA cells) were quantified. In
each case, the inhibitory constants Ki were deduced from semi-log plots (% of remaining Etn
transport vs. logM concentration) and compared between different transport conditions.
As expected, the CTL1 and CTL2 specific inhibitor HC-3 strongly inhibited Etn transport with Ki
values of 3.52 µM (CTL1), 9.14 µM (CTL2) and 5.10 µM for the total (CTL1 + CTL2) transport.
Nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker), was as potent as HC-3 with Ki = 8.07 - 8.48 µM.
Verapamil (a calcium channel blocker) was an intermediate CTL1/2 inhibitor with Ki = 20 - 62

µM. Additionally, quinine (antimalaria drug) with Ki = 33 - 38 µM, was a medium CTL1/2
inhibitor while the Cho oxidation product betaine was a poor inhibitor (Ki = 5806 - 6216 µM) of
CTL1 and CTL2 Etn transports (Fig. 5B and C).
The inhibition of CTL1 specific transport (Fig. 5B) with excess choline and Etn was similar, with
Ki = 282 - 284 µM. The Ki however differed for CTL2 specific transport (Fig. 5C), with Ki = 1214
µM for Cho and 550 µM for Etn. The Ki value for the total (CTL1 + CTL2) transport (Fig. 5A)
was 226 µM for Cho and 701 µM for Etn. Thus, the Ki values indicated that Cho and Etn are
transported similarly by the high affinity transporter CTL1. The low affinity transporter CTL2
however had reduced and different affinity for Cho and Etn, with more preference for Etn as its
substrate. Residual Etn transport (unrelated to CTL1 and CTL2) was distinguished by CTL2
siRNA treatment of M2 cells (Fig. 5D). This residual transport component has a low affinity for
Cho and Etn (Ki = 1029-1394 µM) and three orders of magnitude higher Ki = 1869 µM for HC-3
showing that is not a CTL1/2 related transport. Finally, comparison of all transport velocities (Fig.
5E) showed a general order of contributions, from the high affinity CTL1 (Ctrl + CTL2 siRNA),
low affinity CTL2 (M2), and the residual very low affinity (M2+CTL2 siRNA) transports for Etn.
CTL1(Ctrl) contributed 80%, CTL2 (M2) 12.5%, and the unrelated residual transport (M2 + CTL2
siRNA) accounted for 7.5% to the total transport. The Ctrl and M2 cells express OCT and OCTN
and other unspecific Cho transporters that could be contributing to this residual transport (15).
CTL1 and CTL2 mediate Etn transport to mitochondria. CTL1 and CTL2 are present in the
mitochondria and are involved in mitochondrial Cho transport (4,5). We used COXIV as a marker
of mitochondria isolated from Ctrl and M2 cells and CTL2 mRNA expression for the siRNA
knockdown of CTL2 transport (Fig. 6A). By comparing the contributions of all mitochondria
transport components (Fig. 6B), CTL1+CTL2 (Ctrl) contributed 70%, CTL2 (M2) 20%, and the
residual unrelated transport (M2 + CTL2 siRNA) contributed 10% to the total mitochondria Etn
transport. We also compared the rates of [14C]-Etn transport in the isolated mitochondria and the
whole cells and in the presence and absence of the specific inhibitor HC-3. As expected, the CTL1
and CTL2 inhibitor HC-3 blunted Etn uptake in a time dependent manner in the mitochondria (Fig.
6C, E) and the whole cells (Fig. 6 D, F). In the absence of HC-3, the rate of Ctrl mitochondria
transport was similar to the whole cell Ctrl transport (0.04 and 0.05 µmol/mg/min, respectively);
M2 mitochondrial transport was also similar to the whole cell transport (0.008 and 0.01

µmol/mg/min respectively) (Fig. 6E, F), demonstrating that the same proteins are responsible for
the transports in the whole cell and mitochondria. In addition, the M2 mitochondrial (CTL2 only)
transport was 5-fold slower that the total (CTL1+CTL2) transport of the Ctrl mitochondria. Taken
together, these data established that CTL1 and CTL2 mediate mitochondrial Etn transport with the
same kinetic properties as in the whole cells.

Discussion
PE and PC are bilayer forming phospholipids involved in fundamental membrane processes,
growth, survival and cell signaling (11). PE and PC are similarly synthesized by CDP-Etn and
CDP-Cho Kennedy pathway, in which the extracellular substrates Cho and Etn are actively
transported into the cell, phosphorylated, and coupled with diacylglycerols (DAG) to form the
final phospholipid product. Cho and Etn released from PC and PE also need to be transported in
and out of the cytosol and mitochondria or reincorporated into the Kennedy pathway. The plasma
membrane CTL1 is firmly assigned to Cho transport for PC synthesis (15), yet the exact function
of the mitochondrial CTL1 is still not clear. In the liver and kidney mitochondria, Cho is
specifically oxidized to betaine, the major methyl donor in the one-carbon cycle (6). Since broadly
expressed, it is proposed that the mitochondrial CTL1 could maintain the intracellular pools of
Cho and as +H-antiporter could regulate the electrochemical/proton gradient in the mitochondria
(5, 15, 18). CTL2 is only indirectly implicated in Cho transport and until this work the exact CTL2
substrate binding and transport mechanism were not firmly established, in neither the whole cells
nor isolated mitochondria.
Based on our extensive work on CTL1 and Cho transport (3-8, 15) and known similarities
between Cho and Etn transports in various conditions (12-14) we postulated that CTL1 could be
that long-searched for Etn/Cho transporter and the last missing link between CDP-Cho and CDPEtn pathways for phospholipids synthesis. We conducted an extensive number of kinetic,
metabolic, and genetic experiments to solidify this hypothesis. We established that CTL1 mediated
a high affinity Etn transport with K1 = 56-67µM and that CTL2 mediated a low Etn affinity
transport with K2 = 275-299 µM in primary human fibroblasts and monkey Cos7 cells. Importantly,
the CTL1 affinity constant for Etn binding is in the range of physiological Etn concentration in rat
and humans (10-75µM) (13), and explains why CTL1 contributed the most (70-80%) of the Etn
transport in the whole cells and mitochondria.
We recently described the first human disorder caused by homozygous frame-shift
mutations in the CTL1 gene SLC44A1: M1= SLC44A1

and M3=

abnormalities.

Paradoxically, although Cho transport and CDP-Cho Kennedy pathway were diminished, PC
remained preserved in the cerebrospinal fluid and skin fibroblasts of the affected individuals (15).
The cell membranes were however drastically remodeled and depleted of PE and PS, apparently
as a homeostatic response to preserve PC and prevent Cho deficiency in the affected individuals
(15). Since the majority of PE is produced de novo by the CDP-Etn pathway, we utilized CTL1
mutant cells to establish if Etn transport and de novo PE synthesis were reduced in the affected
individuals. We showed that (M2) SLC44A1 ΔSer126 patient fibroblasts relies on CTL2 for Cho and
Etn transport and were devoid of CTL1 mediated Etn transport, which revealed a new biological
role for CTL1 and CTL2 that could help in developing new treatments strategy for this devastating
disease.
Cho supplementation led the membrane lipids and organelle recovery in CTL1 mutant
fibroblast (15) suggesting that transporters other than CTL1 could support the transport when extra
substrate became available. We focused on CTL2 as the most plausible alternative candidate for
Cho and Etn transport in CTL1 deficient cells (19-22, 25). We separated CTL2 and CTL1
transports using specific antibodies, and depletion and overexpression strategies in CTL1 M2
mutant and Ctrl cells. As a low affinity Etn transporter CTL2 contributed 20-30% to the total
transport in the whole cells and isolated mitochondria. CTL1 deficient cells had reduced but not
absent CDP-Cho (15) and also had reduced CDP-Etn Kennedy pathway showing that CTL2 is able
to channel both substrates for phospholipid synthesis, albeit with a reduced capacity. Apparently,
in the individuals with the SLC44A1 homozygous mutation (15) under normal physiological
conditions CTL2 did not compensate the complete loss of CTL1 but as a low affinity (high
capacity) transporter it could be beneficial in delivering extra Cho and Etn.
PE plays important structural role in mitochondria (24, 26) and is important for stabilizing
the electron transport complexes (27-30). Both CTL1 and CTL2 are prominently present in
mitochondria and both transport Cho (3, 19) into mitochondria. When identical proteins are
involved, it is expected that transport characteristics are similar even in separate cellular
compartments; this was case with Etn transport in the whole cells and mitochondria of Ctrl cells
(40-50 nmol/mg/min; CTL1+CTL2) and M2 whole cells and mitochondria (8-10 nmol/mg/min
CTL2 only). We clearly demonstrated that CTL1 and CTL2 channel the extracellular Etn into the
Kennedy pathway. Why there is a cellular need for active Etn transport and involvement of the

low and high affinity transporters in the mitochondria is not clear. Mitochondrial CTL1 and CTL2
could maintain the intracellular pools of Cho and Etn and since they are both proton antiporters,
they could be significant regulators of the proton gradient in the mitochondria. Recent studies in
CTL2 knockout mice established that that CTL2 mediated mitochondrial Cho transport is critical
for ATP and ROS production, platelet activation and thrombosis (31). CTL2 gene SLC44A2 is
well-established the human neutrophil antigen (32), and genetic risk factor for hearing loss,
Meniere’s disease and venous thrombosis (33). Neutrophil CTL2 could interact directly with
platelets’ integrin αIIbβ3, and induce neutrophil extracellular trap (NETosis) that than promote
thrombosis (34). SLC44A2 knockout mouse is protected against venous thrombosis showing that CTL2
could be an important therapeutic target for the disease (35-37). Our investigation provides insights

into the novel function of CTL2/SLC44A2 as an Etn transporter, which will contribute to a better
understanding of previous studies and the optimization of prevention and treatment strategies in
those various diseases.
Altogether, CTL1 and CTL2 are the physiological Etn transporters in the whole cells and
mitochondria, with intrinsic roles in de novo PE synthesis by the CDP-Etn Kennedy pathway and
intracellular compartmentation of Etn. A schematic representation of Etn transport mechanisms
at the cell surface and mitochondria is in Fig 6G. CTL1 and CTL2 are ethanolamine/proton
antiporters of high and low affinity, respectively. They are responsible for extracellular uptake and
intracellular balance of Etn. Extracellular Etn is immediately phosphorylated by Etn kinase (EK)
and further consumed by the CDP-Etn pathway to form the membrane phospholipid PE. The
intracellular Etn is released after PE degradation by lipolysis and/or replacement of the Etn
headgroup with serine in PE to form PS by PS synthase 2 (PSS2). The metabolically released Etn
can be removed, or it can enter mitochondria and/or be phosphorylated and recycled by the CDPEtn Kennedy pathway.

Materials and Methods
Maintenance of cell lines. Control, M1 and M2 primary human skin fibroblasts were maintained
in MEM (Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum and 2%
penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were kept in a humidified atmosphere at 37oC and 5% CO2. MCF-7
human breast cancer cells, MCF-10 human mammary epithelial cells and COS-7 fibroblast-like
monkey cells were maintained in DMEM (Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 2% penicillin/streptomycin.
Transport Studies. According to our previously standardized protocols (3) cells were incubated
with 0.2 µCi [14C]-Etn or [3H]-Cho with the compound of interest for 20 minutes and room
temperature. To stop the transport, cells were washed in ice cold KRH buffer containing 500 µM
‘cold’ Cho or Etn. Cells were then lysed in 500 µl ice cold lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM
EDTA and 10 mM NaF) and the radiolabeled Cho and Etn were analyzed by LSC. Kinetic
constants for Etn transport were determined as before for Cho (38). Cells were incubated (20 min)
with increasing concentrations of unlabeled Etn (0-1000 µM) before being treated with 0.2 µCi
[14C]-Etn for 20 minutes. The saturation curves of [14C]-Etn transport velocity (V) vs. Etn
concentration (S) were produced in different cell types and the transport affinity constants (K1 and
K2) derived from linearized Eadie-Hofstee plots using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, Inc.).
To study the effect of pH on Etn uptake, the cells were treated with KRH buffers of varying pH
(pH 5.5 - 8.5). Buffers were prepared by mixing 10 mM MES (pH 5.5) and 10 mM bicine (pH
8.5). To assess the effects of [Na+] on Etn uptake, the cells were subjected to either standard KRH
buffer or KRH buffer with LiCl instead of NaCl. For transport inhibition, 8.0 x 104 cells/well were
treated with various compounds for 24h. The concentration curves for a specific compound (HC3,
Eth, Cho, betaine, verapamil, quinine, nifedipine) were produced for each cell type and Ki derived
from the semi log plots of transport Inhibition (%) vs log [drug concentration] were compared.
In studies with CTL1 and CTL2 antibodies 8.0 x 104 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates and
grown for 24h. After 24h of growth, various amounts of antibodies were added to cells and
incubated for 24h and Cho and Etn uptake were then conducted.

To analyze the CDP-Etn Kennedy pathways cells were radiolabeled with 0.2 µCi [14C]-Etn (ARC
St. Louis, MO) for 1-3h (pulse and pulse- chase). Water-soluble pathway intermediates (Etn, PEtn and CDP-Etn) and PE were extracted and separated with the method of Bligh and Dyer (39).
For pulse experiments, cells were incubated for 1, 2 and 3h with 0.2 µCi [14C]-Etn, and for pulsechase experiments, cells were incubated for 1h with 0.2 µCi [14C]-Etn, washed with PBS and then
chased for 1-3h with an excess of unlabeled Etn. At each time point, radiolabeled compounds were
extracted with the method of Bligh and Byer, separated by TLC using appropriate standards and
radioactivity (dpm) determined by liquid scintillation counting (40). Phospholipid (PC, PS and PE)
and neutral lipid (DAG and TAG) pools were determined by 24h steady-state (equilibrium)
radiolabeling with 3H-glycerol as previously described (40).
Pcyt2 Activity Assay. The assay was conducted as described (40). In brief, cells were cultured for
24h and 50 µg protein was dissolved in Pcyt2 reaction mixture. The mixture was treated for 15
minutes with 0.2 µCi [14C]-PEtn and the reaction was terminated by boiling for 2 minutes. The
radiolabeled Pcyt2 reaction product [14C]-CDP-Etn was isolated by TLC and Pcyt2 activity was
expressed as nmol/min/mg protein.
RNA extraction and RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Life
Technologies Incorporated, Burlington, ON, Canada). DNase I was used to eliminate genomic
DNA and cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg RNA with RNA SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies Incorporated). Expression of CTL1, CTL2, CK, EK, Pcyt1, Pcyt2,
PSD, PSS1 and PSS2 was determined by PCR using the primers and conditions as before (15).
Reactions were standardized by amplifying glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
and relative band intensity was quantified using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).
Expression of rat CTL1-Myc cDNA, murine CTL2 cDNA and CTL2 siRNA. Confluent cells
were transfected with 5 µg of pCMV3-ORF-C-Myc-SLC44A1 cDNA (Sino Biologics, #
RG80408-CM), pCMV-SPORT6-SLC44A2 cDNA (Genomics Online, # ABIN3822596) or
empty vector (pcDNA4His-Max B, # V86420) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
Transfections with 30 nM SLC44A2 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, # sc-62163) was with
siPORT lipid transfection agent.

Immunoblotting. Cells were washed 3x with PBS and subjected to a lysis buffer (25 mM Tris,
15% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 8 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitor cocktail and
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail) at 4oC for 30 minutes. Protein concentration was determined with
the bicinchoninic (BCA) assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). The LV58 (N-terminus) and ENS627 (C-terminus) antibodies (both 1:500 in 5% skim milk in TBS-T) detect the 72 kDa CTL1
protein under native (non-denaturing) conditions. Samples were mixed with loading buffer (62
mM Tris-HCl, 0.01% bromophenol blue and 10% glycerol) and separated by PAGE at 120 V for
1.5h. CTL1, CTL2 (Abnova; 1:200 in 5% skim milk in TBS-T) and β-tubulin (Cell signaling;
1:1000 in 5% skim milk in TBS-T) were resolved on an 8% native gel and proteins were transferred
onto PVDF membranes (Pall Canada, Mississauga, ON, Canada) by a semi-dry transfer system
and stained with Ponceau S. Membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk in Tris Buffered SalineTween 20 (TBS-T) solution and then incubated with primary antibodies (1:500 in 5% skim milk
in TBS-T) overnight at 4oC. Membranes were washed with TBS-T and then incubated with an
anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody (New England Biolabs,
1:10,000 in 5% skim milk in TBS-T) for 2h. Membranes were washed in TBS-T and proteins were
visualized using a chemiluminescent substrate (Sigma Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada).
Mitochondrial Isolation. Mitochondria were isolated as initially described (18). In brief, cells
were incubated for 20 minutes in ice-cold RSB swelling buffer and homogenized; 19 ml MS buffer
was added, and the cell homogenate was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 minutes. This step was
repeated twice, and the final supernatant was centrifuged at 12,500 rpm. The resulting pellet was
resuspended in MS buffer. The mitochondria purity was determined using COXIV mitochondria
marked and β-tubulin as a whole cell control.
Statistical Analysis. All measurements are expressed as means from quadruplets ± SEM.
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, Inc.). Data were
subjected to students T-test. Differences were considered statistically significant at *p < 0.05.

(HC-3, 200µM) or anti-CTL1 antibody (1:500) and then radiolabeled with 0.2 µCi [14C]-Etn or
[3H]-Cho for 24h. Both [3H]PC and [14C]PE were significantly reduced in HC-3 and anti-CTL1
treated cells relative to untreated (-) cells. (C) 0.2 µCi [14C]-Etn or [3H]-Cho uptake measured after
20 min in MCF7 cells were significantly reduced with HC-3 (200 µM) added 20 min prior to the

(0-1000 μM, 20 min) in control human fibroblasts (Ctrl), CTL1 deficient human fibroblasts (M1
and M2) and monkey COS-7 cell line (B) The Eadie-Hofstee plots derived from those curves
demonstrated the presence of two Etn transport systems, with binding constants K1 (higher
affinity) and K2 (lower affinity), in Ctrl and COS-7 cells. Only one transport system with the lower
affinity was present in CTL1 deficient M1 (279.6 ± 17.1 μM (K2)) and M2 (275.4 ± 13.9 μM (K2))
cells. (C) CTL1 protein (72 kDa) was detected in Ctrl and COS-7 cells while a truncated, low
abundant 58 kDa protein was detected in M1 cells. No CTL1 protein was detected in M2 cells
showing that the Eadie-Hofstee plots K2 Etn transport system in those cells is CTL2 related. An
intact 72 kDa CTL2 protein was detected in M1 and M2 cells. (D) CTL2 was not affected while
CTL1 mRNA was almost diminished in M2 cells. (E) The [14C]-Etn uptake is down-regulated with
low extracellular pH (high [H+]) and upregulated at high pH (low [H+]) in both Ctrl (CTL1+CTL2)
and M2 (CTL2 only) cells. (F) Saturation curves and Eadie-Hofstee plots of siRNA-CTL2 treated
Ctrl cells showed the presence of a single Etn transport of a higher affinity (CTL1-mediated, K1,

Figure 6: Characteristics of mitochondrial ethanolamine transport. (A) Western blots of
COXIV mitochondrial marker demonstrating purity of Ctrl and M2 mitochondria; and CTL2
mRNA expression in siRNA-CTL2 treated and untreated M2 cells with complement protein data
in Fig. 4A. (B ) Mitochondrial Etn transport and the effect of CTL2 knockdown in M2 cells; Etn
uptake in Ctrl mitochondria was reduced to 25% in M2 (CTL1 deficient) mitochondria and further
diminished with siRNA depletion of CTL2. Time course inhibition of Etn uptake in (C) Ctrl
mitochondria and (D) whole cells treated with 20 µM HC-3. Time course of Etn uptake in (E) M2
mitochondria and (F) M2 cells treated with 20 µM HC-3. Each point or bar represents the mean ±
SD (n = 4), * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001.
(G) Schematic representation of ethanolamine transport mechanisms at the cell surface and
mitochondria. CTL1 and CTL2 are ethanolamine/proton antiporters of high and low affinity,
respectively. They are responsible for extracellular uptake and intracellular balance of [Etn].
Extracellular Etn is immediately phosphorylated by ethanolamine kinase (EK) and further
consumed by the CDP-Etn pathway to form PE phospholipid. The intracellular Etn is released by
PE degradation by lipolysis and PE exchange to PS by PS synthase 2 (PSS2) and it can enter
mitochondria by both transporters.
