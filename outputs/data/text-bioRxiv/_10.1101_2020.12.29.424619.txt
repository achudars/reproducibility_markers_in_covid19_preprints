Abstract
The emergence of SARS‐CoV‐2 has resulted in a global pandemic. In addition to
respiratory complications as a result of SARS‐CoV‐2 illness, accumulating evidence
suggests that neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated with the
disease caused by the virus. In this study, we investigated the effects of the
SARS‐CoV‐2 spike glycoprotein S1 stimulation on neuroinflammation in BV-2
microglia. Analyses of culture supernatants revealed an increase in the production of
TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β and iNOS/NO. SARS‐CoV‐2 spike glycoprotein S1 increased
protein expressions of phospho-p65 and phospho-IκB, as well as enhancing DNA
binding and transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Pro-inflammatory effects of the
glycoprotein effects were reduced in the presence of BAY11-7082 (1 μM). The
presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 spike glycoprotein S1 in BV-2 microglia increased the
protein expression of NLRP3, as well as caspase-1 activity. However, pre-treatment
with CRID3 (1 μM) or BAY11-7082 (1 μM) resulted in the inhibition of NLRP3
inflammasome/caspase-1. It was also observed that CRID3 attenuated SARS‐CoV‐2
spike glycoprotein S1-induced increase in IL-1β production. Increased protein
expression of p38 MAPK was observed in BV-2 microglia stimulated with the spike
glycoprotein S1, and was reduced in the presence of SKF 86002. These results have
provided the first evidence demonstrating SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 glycoproteininduced neuroinflammation in BV-2 microglia. We propose that promotion of
neuroinflammation by this glycoprotein is mediated through activation of NF-κB,
NLRP3 inflammasome and p38 MAPK. These results are significant because of their
relevance to our understanding of neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms
observed in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Introduction
The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2
(SARS‐CoV‐2) virus in 2019 has resulted in a global pandemic affecting most
countries and territories. To date, there are 79,001,270 confirmed cases and
1,736,019 confirmed deaths, and high numbers of new cases are occurring daily [1].
The most common complications of illness due to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are mainly
related to respiratory symptoms [2-4]. SARS‐CoV‐2 infection causes significant
damage to the alveolus, interstitial and intra-alveolar oedema, infiltration of
inflammatory cells (mainly macrophages) [5].
In addition to respiratory complications of SARS‐CoV‐2 illness, accumulating
evidence show that neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated with
COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus [6]. These neurological and
neuropsychiatric symptoms have been described in a review published by Iadecola
et al. [7]. Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can
produce ACE2-dependent infection of neurons, resulting in neuronal damage [8].
Another study suggested that S1 promotes loss of barrier integrity and proinflammatory response in a 3D model of the human blood-brain barrier [9]. Other
studies have proposed mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-mediated dysfunction of the
CNS [10, 11]. Further understanding of the cellular mechanisms involved in
neurological and neuropsychiatric consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical
for identifying pharmacological strategies for prevention and treatment.
Microglia are brain-resident macrophages that regulate brain development,
maintenance of neuronal networks, and injury repair [12]. In the resting state,
microglia survey their surrounding microenvironment through the projection and
retraction of their highly motile processes [13]. However, in the presence of injury, or
pathology within the CNS there is activation of microglia [14]. In neuroinflammation,
polarised M1 microglia produce proinflammatory cytokines, neurotoxic molecules,
such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-6, IL-1β, nitric oxide (NO), reactive
oxygen species (ROS), which contribute to neuronal dysfunction, while polarised M2
microglia secrete anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10 and transforming growth
factor (TGF-β), which are involved in restoring homeostasis [15-18].

Microglia-mediated neuroinflammation plays significant roles in many neurological
and neuropsychiatry diseases, including neurodegenerative [19-23] and
neuropsychiatric disorders [24-27].
In view of accumulating evidence linking SARS-CoV-2 infection with neurological
and neuropsychiatric symptoms, this study was aimed at determining whether the
SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 glycoprotein activates BV-2 microglia to cause elevated
release of pro-inflammatory mediators.
Materials and methods
Materials
Recombinant human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 (Accession
MN908947) was purchased from Abcam. The protein was suspended in sterile water
for functional studies. The following drugs were used: BAY11-7082 (Sigma), CRID3
sodium salt (Tocris) and SKF 86002 dihydrochloride (Tocris).
Cell culture
BV-2 mouse microglia cell line (ICLCATL03001) was purchased from Interlab Cell
Line Collection (Banca Biologica e Cell Factory, Italy) and cultured in RPMI medium
supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum.
Determination of cytokine production
Cultured BV-2 microglia were seeded out in 24-well plate at 5 × 104 cells/mL and
treated with S1 glycoprotein (10, 50 and 100 ng/mL) for 24 h. Thereafter, medium
was collected and centrifuged to obtain culture supernatants. Levels of TNFα in the
supernatants were determined using mouse instant ELISA™ kit (Thermo Scientific).
Concentrations of TNFα in supernatants were calculated from a mouse TNFα
standard curve, and the assay range was 31.3-2,000 pg/mL. Levels of IL-6 in
supernatants were determined using IL-6 mouse ELISA kit (Thermo Scientific). The
range for IL-6 detection was 4-500 pg/mL. Similarly, levels of IL-1β were evaluated
using IL-1β mouse ELISA kit (Thermo Scientific), with a range of detection of 7.8-500
pg/mL.

Measurement of nitric oxide (NO) production
The Griess reagent (Promega) was used to determine the levels of levels of nitric
NO) in supernatants of cultured BV-2 microglia treated with S1 glycoprotein (10, 50
and 100 ng/mL) for 24 h. Following treatment with S1 glycoprotein, the Griess assay
was carried out by adding 50 μL of sulphanilamide to culture supernatants (50 μL),
followed by incubation in the dark at room temperature for 10 min. of Thereafter 50
µL of N-1-naphthyl ethylenediamine dihydrochloride (NED) was added and the
mixture incubated for a further 10 min. Absorbance was measured at 540nm using a
Tecan Infinite M microplate reader. Nitrite concentrations were determined from a
nitrite standard reference curve.
In cell-western/cytoblot
The in-cell western is a proven method for the rapid quantification of proteins in cells
[28, 29]. BV-2 microglia were seeded into a 96-well plate at 5 × 104 cells/mL. The
cells were treated at 70% confluence. At the end of each experiment, cells were
fixed with 8% paraformaldehyde solution (100 μL) for 15 min., followed by washing
with PBS. The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C.
The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-iNOS (Abcam), rabbit anti-phosphop65 (Cell Signalling Technology), rabbit anti-phospho-IκBα (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), rabbit anti-NLRP3 (Abcam), and rabbit anti-phospho-p38 (Cell
Signalling Technology) antibodies. Thereafter, cells were washed with PBS and
incubated with anti-rabbit HRP secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature.
Then, 100 µL HRP substrate was added to each well and absorbance measured at
450nm with a Tecan Infinite M microplate reader. Readings were normalised with
Janus Green normalisation stain (Abcam).
NF-κB luciferase reporter gene assay
BV2 cells were seeded in 24-well plate at a density of 4 × 104 cells/mL. At 60%
confluence, RPMI medium was replaced with Opti-MEM, with a further incubation for
2 h at 37°C. Transfection of BV-2 cells was performed by preparing a Glia-Mag
transfection reagent (OZ Biosciences) and Cignal NF-κB luciferase reporter (Qiagen)
complex at a ratio 3:1 in 50 μL Opti-MEM. The complex was added to BV-2 cells,
and the plate placed on a magnetic plate (OZ Biosciences) and incubated at 37°C for
30 min, followed by a further magnetic plate-free incubation for 2 h.

Thereafter, medium was changed to serum-free RPMI and cells treated with S1
glycoprotein (10, 50 and 100 ng/mL) for 6 h. This was followed by a Dual-Glo®
reporter assay (Promega). Firefly and renilla luminescence were measured using a
FLUOstar OPTIMA microplate reader (BMG Labtech).
NF-κB transcription factor binding assay
The NF-κB p65 transcription factor assay is a non-radioactive ELISA-based assay
for evaluating DNA binding activity of NF-κB in nuclear extracts. BV-2 microglia were
seeded in a 6-well plate at a density of 4 × 104 cells/mL. The cells were then
incubated with 10, 50 and 100 ng/mL of S1 glycoprotein for 60 min. At the end of the
incubation, nuclear extracts were prepared from the cells and subjected to NF-κB
transcription factor binding assay according to the instructions of the manufacturer
(Abcam).
Caspase-Glo®1 inflammasome assay
The caspase-Glo®1 inflammasome assay (Promega) was used to measure the
activity of caspase-1 directly in live cells or culture supernatants [30]. BV-2 microglia
were seeded out in 24-well plate at a density of 4 × 104 cells/mL and stimulated with
S1 glycoprotein (10, 50 and 10 ng/mL) for 24 h. After incubation, cell culture
supernatants were collected and mixed with equal volume of Caspase-Glo® 1
reagent or Caspase-Glo® 1 reagent + YVAD-CHO (1 μM) in a 96-well plate. The
contents of the wells were mixed using a plate shaker at 400rpm for 30 seconds. The
plate was then incubated at room temperature for 60 min, followed by luminescent
measurement of caspase-1 activity with a FLUOstar OPTIM reader (BMG
LABTECH).
Effects of BAY11-7082, CRID3 and SKF 86002 on S1-induced
neuroinflammation
The effects of the NF-κB inhibitor (BAY11-7082), NLRP3 inhibitor (CRID3) and p38
MAPK inhibitor (SKF 86002) on the release of TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1β production was
investigated by pre-treating BV-2 microglia with BAY11-7082 (1 μM), CRID3 (1 μM),
and SKF 86002 (1 μM) 60 min prior to stimulation with S1 glycoprotein (100 ng/mL)
for a further 24 h. Culture supernatants were collected and analysed for levels of
TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1β using mouse ELISA kits (Thermo Scientific).

Statistical analyses
Data are expressed as mean ± SEM for at least three independent experiments
(n=3) and analysed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc
Tukey’s test (for multiple comparisons). Statistical analysis were conducted using the
GraphPad Prism software (version 9).
Results
Stimulation of BV-2 microglia with spike glycoprotein S1 resulted in elevated
release of TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1β
In initial experiments to investigate the effects of S1 on the release of proinflammatory mediators in BV-2 microglia, 10, 50 and 100 ng/mL of the recombinant
glycoprotein was incubated with the cells for 24 h. At 10 ng/mL of the glycoprotein,
there was an insignificant (p<0.05) elevation in the secretion of TNFα. However, on
increasing its concentration to 50 ng/mL, a significant (p<0.05) increase in the
production of TNFα was observed (Figure 1A). On increasing the concentration of
S1 to 100 ng/mL, there was a ~15-fold increase in the levels of TNFα in culture
supernatants (Figure 1A).
Release of IL-6 was not significantly elevated in BV-2 microglia treated with 10 and
50 ng/mL of S1, in comparison with untreated (control) cells. Incubating the cells with
100 ng/mL of S1 resulted in ~10.2-fold and significant (p<0.001) increase in the
secretion of IL-6 into culture medium (Figure 1B). Similar observations were made in
experiments to determine the effects of S1 on IL-1β production; at 10 and 50 ng/mL
of S1, there was no significant effect on the release of IL-1β. A ~5.5-fold elevation of
IL-1β levels was however observed with 100 ng/mL of S1 (Figure 1C).
Spike glycoprotein S1 induced an increase in NO production and iNOS protein
expression
Analyses of culture supernatants obtained from BV-2 microglia incubated with S1 (10
ng/mL) showed insignificant (p<0.05) increase in the levels of the inflammatory
mediator, when compared with untreated (control) cells. We further showed that
incubation with 50 and 100 ng/mL of the glycoprotein caused ~5.1 and 8.7 increase
in NO production, respectively (p<0.01) (Figure 2A).

We used cytoblot analyses to further demonstrate that incubation with S1 (50 and
100 ng/mL) resulted in significant (p<0.05) increase in protein levels of iNOS (Figure
2B).
Spike glycoprotein S1 activated NF-κB in BV-2 microglia
Following our observation that SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 induced an
increase in the production of pro-inflammatory mediators at 100 ng/mL, we were next
interested in evaluating the role of NF-κB in its activity at this concentration. Firstly,
we investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 on DNA binding
activity of NF-κB, and observed that following treatment of BV-2 microglia with S1
(100 ng/mL) for 60 min, there was a significant (p<0.001) increase in the binding of
NF-κB in nuclear extracts to consensus-binding sites. Interestingly, pre-treatment of
BV-2 cells with the NF-κB inhibitor, BAY11-7082 (1 μM) prior to stimulation with S1
produced an inhibition in DNA binding (Figure 3A).
We also used the luciferase reporter gene assay to evaluate the effects of S1 on
transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Incubation of S1 (100 ng/mL) with BV-2 microglia
that were transfected with an NF-κB reporter for 60 min resulted in a significant
(p<0.01) increase in luciferase activity, in comparison with untreated transfected
cells. We further showed that when the cells were pre-treated with BAY11-7082 (1
μM), S1-induced increase in NF-κB luciferase activity was markedly reduced (Figure
3B).
The effects of S1 on nuclear events of NF-κB signalling prompted us to evaluate
modulation of upstream targets in the pathway. Results of cytoblot analyses in
Figures 3C and 3D show that S1 increased protein levels of both phospho-p65 and
phospho-IκBα following incubation with BV-2 microglia for 15 min (p<0.01). Results
also show that protein levels of phospho-p65 and phospho-IκBα were reduced in the
presence of BAY11-7082 (1 μM).
Pre-treatment with BAY11-7082 reduced S1-induced production of proinflammatory mediators
In order to further confirm the roles of NF-κB in SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1induced neuroinflammation, BV-2 microglia were pre-treated with BAY11-7082 prior
to stimulation with the glycoprotein for 24 h and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines

(TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1β) were measured in culture supernatants (Figures 4A, 4B and
4C). In the presence of BAY11-7082 (μM), S1-induced increases in the production of
TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1β in BV-2 microglia were reduced by ~59.6%, ~40.6% and
~32.8%, respectively.
Results in Figures 5A and 5B also show that S1-induced increase in NO production
and iNOS protein expression were significantly (p<0.01) reduced when the cells
were treated with BAY11-7082 (1 μM) prior to S1 stimulation.
Spike glycoprotein S1 triggers activation of NLRP3 inflammasome/caspase-1
in BV-2 microglia
The NLRP3 inflammasome is known to contribute to the secretion of IL-1β during
inflammation. Encouraged by the results of experiments showing an increase in the
production of this cytokine following BV-2 stimulation with S1, we next investigated
it’s effect on protein levels of NLRP3 in the presence and absence of known NLRP3
inhibitors, CRID3 and BAY11-7082. Cytoblot analyses revealed that stimulation of
BV-2 microglia with S1 (100 ng/mL) for 6 h resulted in ~11-fold increase in levels of
NLRP3 protein (Figure 6A). It was also observed that S1-induced increase in NLRP3
protein levels were significantly reduced (p<0.05) in the presence of CRID3 (1 μM)
and BAY11-7082 (1 μM) (Figure 6A).
We next determined measured caspase-1 activity in culture media of BV-2 cells that
were stimulated with spike glycoprotein S1 for 6 h. Results in Figure 6B show a ~4.4fold increase in caspase-1 activity as a result of S1 stimulation. Furthermore, both
CRID3 (1 μM) and BAY11-7082 (1 μM) produced significant (p<0.001) inhibition in
S1-induced increased caspase-1 activity (Figure 6B).
CRID3 prevented S1-induced increase in IL-1β production
Experiments to evaluate the effects of CRID3 on S1-induced increased secretion of
TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1β in BV-2 microglia revealed that pre-treatment with CRID3 (1
μM) was ineffective in reducing TNFα (Figure 7A) and IL-6 (Figure 7B) production.
However, in the presence of CRID3 S1-induced increased IL-1β production was
significantly reduced (p<0.001) (Figure 7C). S1-induced NO production was not
reduced by pre-treatment with CRID3 (Figure 7D).

Effect of spike glycoprotein S1 on p38 MAPK activation
Incubation of spike glycoprotein S1 (100 ng/mL) with BV-2 microglia for 60 min
resulted in a significant (p<0.01) and ~11.3-fold increase in protein levels of
phospho-p38; an outcome that was prevented by pre-treating the cells with
SKF86002 (1 μM) for 60 min prior to S1 stimulation (Figure 8).
S1-induced increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production was reduced by
SKF86002
Based on the results showing that S1 caused an increase in protein levels of
phospho-p38 and its inhibition by SKF86002, we were next interested to determine
the effects of this inhibitor on cytokine production in S1-stimulated BV-2 microglia. In
the presence of SKF86002 (1 μM), TNFα production was reduced by ~47.9%
compared with S1 alone (Figure 9A). Similarly, S1-induced increased production of
IL-6 was significantly (p<0.05) reduced in the presence of SKF86002 (1 μM) (Figure
9B). However, there was insignificant reduction in the production of IL-1b by
SKF86002 (Figure 9C).
Discussion
In SARS-CoV-2 infection, viral attachment, fusion and entry into the host’s cells are
facilitated by the spike glycoproteins which protrude from the surface of mature
virions, by binding to the host ACE2 protein [31, 32]. Studies have shown that in
addition to facilitating its fusion to the cell membrane, the location of the S
glycoprotein on SARS-CoV-2 also makes it a direct target for host immune
responses [31].
We report for the first time that a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein subunit S1 activated BV-2 microglia to induce significantly increased release of TNFα,
IL-6 and IL-1β. This is a significant outcome based on the role of microglia activation
in neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions, and findings linking SARS-CoV-2
infection with these conditions. It is highly likely that S1-induced production of high
concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the microglia results in neuronal
damage and/or dysfunction in some of these CNS conditions. In Parkinson’s disease
for example, significant increase in the expression of IL-1β was shown in the
substantia nigra and frontal cortex, compared to controls [33]. Pro-inflammatory

cytokine (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6) release has also been linked to depression-like
behaviours and cognitive defects in mice [34]. Activation of neuroinflammatory
processes by the spike S1 glycoprotein was further confirmed by results showing
increased iNOS-mediated production of NO by the protein in microglia. Spike S1
glycoprotein-induced elevated NO production in the microglia is a significant finding
in our understanding of the mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2-mediated
neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Elevated iNOS/NO has been strongly
linked to a wide range of CNS disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s
disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and migraine [35]. These results reflect the
outcome of a study which reports that the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins trigger a
pro-inflammatory response on brain endothelial cells, thus contributing to an altered
state of BBB function [6]. Our results showing SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 glycoproteininduced neuroinflammation in the microglia suggests that this mechanism may be
contributing to some of the neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms in SARSCoV-2 infected patients.
In neuroinflammation, the NF-κB transcription factor regulates the production of
multiple pro-inflammatory genes, including the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as
TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1β, as well as iNOS. We further showed that activation of
microglial NF-κB signalling mediates the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in
the microglia by SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 glycoprotein through its ability to promote
cytoplasmic phosphorylation of the p65 sub-unit and IκBα, as well as DNA binding of
p65 sub-unit and NF-κB transcriptional activity. Interestingly, these effects were
blocked by the potent NF-κB inhibitor, BAY11-7082. The involvement of NF-κB in S1
glycoprotein-induced neuroinflammation was further confirmed by results showing
the effectiveness of BAY11-7082 in blocking S1 glycoprotein-induced production of
TNFα, IL-6 and IL-1β, and iNOS/NO in BV-2 microglia. In a study reported by Patra
et al., SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein was shown to promote IL-6 signalling through
NF-κB in epithelial cells to initiate coordination of a hyper-inflammatory response
[36]. To our knowledge, this is the evidence supporting the role of NF-κB in S1
glycoprotein-induced microglia activation.
There have been reports in the scientific literature suggesting that the NLRP3
inflammasome may be contributing to the release of cytokines such as IL-1β during

SARS-CoV-2-induced hyper-inflammation [37-39]. In the microglia, activation of
NLRP3 by extracellular ATP, certain bacterial toxins, crystalline and particulate
matters results in caspase-1 activation which then cleaves the precursors of IL-1β
and IL-18 to generate active IL-1β and IL-18. These mechanisms results in the
neuroinflammation and pyroptosis [40-42]. In this study, we showed that in addition
to increasing IL-1β production, SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 glycoprotein activated NLRP3
inflammasome and increased caspase-1 activity in BV-2 microglia. These effects
were shown to be attenuated by CRID3 and BAY11-7082, which are known
inhibitors of NLRP3. Furthermore, pre-treatment of BV-2 microglia with CRID3
prevented SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 glycoprotein-induced IL-1β-production, but not
TNFα, IL-6 or NO, thereby confirming a role for NLRP3 in neuroinflammation
induced by this glycoprotein in BV-2 microglia.
It is not clear from this study if the activation of NLRP3/caspase-1 by SARS-CoV-2
spike S1 glycoprotein was due to a direct effect on NLRP3 or an indirect action as a
result of activating NF-κB. It has been suggested that activation of NF-κB could
trigger NLRP3 through caspase-1, with subsequent release of mature IL-1β [43]. The
roles of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 glycoproteininduced neuroinflammation requires further investigation.
SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 glycoprotein induced activation of p38 MAPK through an
increase in protein levels of phospho-p38 in BV-2 microglia. This effect was blocked
in the presence of SKF 86002, a p38 inhibitor. In addition, SKF 86002 reduced
SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 glycoprotein-induced increased production of TNFα and IL-6,
which further shows a modulation of p38 MAPK signalling by the glycoprotein. While
studies have shown that there is a cross-talk between NF-κB and p38 MAPK
activation which may account for these results, further studies will establish the exact
molecular target of SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 glycoprotein effect on p38 activation
pathway in the microglia.
The results obtained from these experiments have provided the first evidence
demonstrating activation of BV-2 microglia by SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 glycoprotein,
resulting in the production pro-inflammatory mediators TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β and NO.
We propose that induction of neuroinflammation by this glycoprotein in the microglia
is mediated through activation of NF-κB, through a potential cross-talk with NLRP3

inflammasome and p38 MAPK. These results are significant because of their
relevance to our understanding of neurological and neuropsychiatric symproms
observed in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.The possible involvement of
microglia ACE2 and the toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the effects of the glycoprotein
have not been evaluated in this study and will be a focus of follow-up investigations.
