Abstract
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been suggested as a receptor for severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry to cause coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, no ACE2 inhibitors have shown definite
beneficiaries for COVID-19 patients, applying the presence of another receptor for
SARS-CoV-2 entry. Here we show that ACE2 knockout dose not completely block
virus entry, while TfR directly interacts with virus Spike protein to mediate virus
entry and SARS-CoV-2 can infect mice with over-expressed humanized transferrin
receptor (TfR) and without humanized ACE2. TfR-virus co-localization is found both
on the membranes and in the cytoplasma, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 transporting by
TfR, the iron-transporting receptor shuttling between cell membranes and cytoplasma.
Interfering TfR-Spike interaction blocks virus entry to exert significant anti-viral
effects. Anti-TfR antibody (EC50 ∼16.6 nM) shows promising anti-viral effects in
mouse model. Collectively, this report indicates that TfR is another receptor for
SARS-CoV-2 entry and a promising anti-COVID-19 target.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which has been
assessed and characterized as a pandemic by world health organization on 11 March,
2020 (https://www.who.int/), causes coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) with
influenza-like manifestations ranging from mild disease to severe pneumonia, fatal
acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure, and
consequently resulting to high morbidity and mortality, especially in older patients
with other co-morbidities1-10. As of October 22, 2020, the ongoing COVID-2019
pandemic has swept through 212 countries and infected more than 40 932 220
individuals, posing an enormous burden to public health and an unprecedented effects
to civil societies. Unfortunately, to date, there is no vaccine or antiviral treatment for
this coronavirus. The pathogenesis and etiology of COVID-19 remain unclear, and
there are no targeted therapies for COVID-19 patients 11.
Pioneer studies

12,13

have demonstrated that angiotensin converting enzyme 2

(ACE2) is the critical receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
(SARS-CoV), which first emerged 17 years ago 14. The spike protein of SARS-CoV
binds to the host ACE2 receptor and then enters into the target cells. SARS-CoV-2
bears an 82% resemblance to the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV15. Especially, the
receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to the SARS-CoV
RBD, suggesting a possible common host cell receptor. Several cryoelectron
microscopy (cryo-EM) studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
directly binds to ACE2 with high affinity

high doses (100 mg/mL) has been reported to partially reduce SARS-CoV-2 growth 21.
Recently, Monteil et al., reported that clinical-grade soluble human ACE2 can
significantly block early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infections in engineered human
tissues

19

. However, no definite evidence indicates that taking ACEIs/ARBs is

beneficial or harmful for COVID-19 infected patients

11

, suggesting possibilities of

other factor/factors assisting in virus entry. Indeed, recent study has shown that
neuropilin-1 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and infectivity 22.
Here, we identified the ubiquitously expressed transferrin receptor (TfR), which
is co-localized with ACE2 on cell membranes, as an entry factor of SARS-CoV-2 by
directly binding to virus spike protein and ACE2 with high affinities. Moreover, we
found that interferences of spike-TfR interaction inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in
Vero E6 cells and mouse model.

Results
Elevated expression of TfR in respiratory tract and lung tissue of monkey and
mouse infected by SARS-CoV-2
TfR is ubiquitously expressed 23. Given that respiratory tract is a susceptible site for
SARS-CoV-2 infection, we employed qRT-PCR and western blot techniques to detect
the expression of TfR and ACE2 in several tissues including respiratory tract (nasal
cavity, trachea, and lung) and liver. In both RNA and protein levels, the expression of

both TfR and ACE2 were significantly elevated in trachea and lung as compared with
other tissues (Fig. 1A-C). As illustrated in Fig. 1D and E, TfR was upregulated in lung
tissue of SARS-CoV-2 infected monkey and humanized ACE2 (hACE2) mice by
immunohistochemical analysis.

Direct interactions among virus spike protein, ACE2 and TfR
Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was used to study the interaction between TfR and
the virus spike protein. As illustrated in Fig. 2A and B, TfR directly interacted with
the virus spike protein through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and
SPR analysis, whereby, the association rate constant (Ka), dissociation rate constant
(Kd), and equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) values for the interaction between
TfR and spike were 2.69× 105 M−1s−1, 7.92 × 10−4 s−1and 2.95 nM, respectively. The
effect of TfR on the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, which binds to the cell receptor
ACE224,25, was also assayed using SPR (Fig. 2C). The KD value between TfR and
SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD was

～43 nM, which is a bit weaker compared with the

binding affinity between TfR and SARS-CoV-2 spike.
Based on the TfR structures

26

and the virus spike protein 27, we made a docking

model of TfR-spike interaction (Fig. S1). According to the model, two designed
peptides (SL8: SKVEKLTL; QK8: QDSNWASK) were used to interfere with the
binding of TfR to spike (Table S1). As illustrated in Fig. 2D, these peptides inhibited
TfR-Spike interaction.
As illustrated in Fig. 2E and F, TfR also directly interacted with ACE2 through
6

SPR and native polyacrylamidegel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis, and the Ka, Kd,
and KD values for the interaction between TfR and ACE2 were 6.33× 104 M−1s−1,
1.25 × 10−2 s−1 and 200 nM, respectively. Based on the TfR, ACE2, and spike protein
structures, we made docking models of TfR-ACE2 (Fig. S2) and TfR-ACE2-Spike
interactions (Fig. S3). According to these models, two inhibitory peptides (SL8 and
FG8: FPFLAYSG) were designed to interfere with TfR-ACE2 complex formation
(Table S2). As illustrated in Fig. 2G, these peptides inhibited TfR-ACE2 interaction
determined by SPR. Notably, co-immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that SL8,
but not scrambled peptide of SL8 (SL8-scr), interfered with TfR-ACE2-Spike
complex formation (Fig. 2H), indicating that SL8 affected both interactions of
TfR-ACE2 and TfR-Spike.
In vitro direct interaction between TfR and SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed as
reported above. We next investigated the interaction between TfR and SARS-CoV-2
on cell membranes. As illustrated in Fig. 2I, high density of TfR was found on the
membranes of Vero E6 cells. Following the infection of SARS-CoV-2 to the Vero E6
cells, significant co-localization of TfR and SARS-CoV-2 was observed on the cell
membranes and in the cytoplasma (Fig. 2I), suggesting that TfR is a membrane
receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Further study indicated that TfR was also co-localized with
ACE2 on the membranes of both infected and uninfected cells by the virus.
Importantly, in the infected cells by the virus, the co-localization of TfR, ACE2, and
virus was observed on cell membranes (Fig. 2J), but only TfR-virus co-localization
was observed in the cytoplasma, suggesting that the virus is transported into

cytoplasma by TfR.

Interferences of TfR-Spike interaction inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection
Soluble TfR, Tf, anti-TfR antibody and the designed peptides as mentioned above
were used to test their effects on SARS-CoV-2 infections by cytopathic effect
(CPE)-based anti-viral assay. As expected, CPE inhibition and quantitative RT-PCR
(qRT-PCR) assays indicated that all of them blocked the virus infections to Vero E6
cells (Fig. 3). The concentration to inhibit 50 % viral entry (EC50) determined by
CPE assays was 80, 125 and 50 nM (Fig. 3B, D, and F) for soluble TfR, Tf and
anti-TfR antibody, while that was 93, 160 and 16.6 nM (Fig. 3C, E, and G)
determined by RT-PCR, respectively. There was no cytotoxicity even in their
concentration up to 1000 nM (Fig. 3B-G). Notably, the anti-viral effect of 200 nM
anti-TfR antibody was comparable to that of high concentration of Remdeivir (4 μM).
In addition, the designed peptides showed strong ability to inhibit the viral entry (Fig.
3H-K). At the concentration of 80 μM, SL8, QK8, and FG8 inhibited 87, 99, and 75 %
virus infection, respectively (Fig. 3H-K).

SARS-CoV-2 infects ACE2 knockout cells
As illustrated in Fig. 4A and B, ACE2 in Vero E6 and A549 cells were successfully
knocked out. Importantly, ACE2-knockout Vero E6 and A549 cells were infected by
SARS-CoV-2, and infections in ACE2-knockout Vero E6 and A549 cells were
inhibited by anti-TfR antibody (Fig. 4C and D). As illustrated in Fig. S4, the TfR

expression levels were first validated by western blot and TfR overexpression
promoted virus infection, which was inhibited by TfR down-regulation (Fig. 4E and
F).

Humanized TfR (hTfR) mice are sensitized for SARS-CoV-2 infection
The adenoviral vector (AD5) expressing human TfR was constructed as the methods
described28. Mice were transduced intranasally with Ad5-hTfR, and human TfR
expression in lung tissue was validated by western blot (Fig. S5). As illustrated in Fig.
5A, elevated viral replication was detected in lung tissue of hTfR mice at 1, 3, and 5
dpi. Viral infection caused a decrease in mouse body weight, and hTfR showed an
obvious decrease in body weight than wild-type mice (Fig. 5B). As illustrated in Fig.
5C, hTfR mice showed more severe vascular congestion and hemorrhage than
wild-type mice.

Anti-TfR antibody shows promising anit-SARS-CoV-2 effects
As illustrated in Fig. 6A, anti-TfR antibody administration inhibited viral replication
in mice lung tissue at 3 and 5 dpi, whereas the isotype control IgG administration
showed no effects on it. Anti-TfR antibody administration inhibited the decrease in
mouse body weight caused by viral infection (Fig. 6B). Histopathological
examination of the lungs sections indicated that mice in the control group showed
typical interstitial pneumonia (Fig. 6C and D). Anti-TfR antibody administration
showed significant protective effects and prevented histopathological injuries caused

Discussion
The present study reports the identification of TfR, the ubiquitously expressed host
receptor on cell membranes, as a new entry factor of SARS-CoV-2 and its elevated
expression in respiratory tract upon the virus infetion. TfR mediates SARS-CoV-2
infection by directly binding to spike protein with a high affinity and transporting the
virus into host cells. Blocking the interactions among TfR, ACE2 and
SARS-CoV-2-Spike protein by using soluble TfR, Tf, anti-TfR antibody, or designed
peptides inhibits the virus infection in mouse model, revealing that TfR-Spike
complex (also possible TfR-ACE2-Spike complex) is a machinery of SARS-CoV-2
entry and thus providing a new strategies for COVID-19 treatment. Especially, with
an EC50 of 16.6 nM, anti-TfR antibody shows promising anti-viral effects in both in
vitro and in vivo.
Iron is an essential nutrient element for both host and pathogens. Host innate
immune response intensively orchestrates control over iron metabolism to limit its
availability during microbe infection. TfR acts as the primary gatekeeper of iron
metabolism by binding iron-bound holo-Tf with greater affinity than iron-free apo-Tf
and responding to fluctuating iron levels due to the activity of iron response element
binding proteins. Cellular iron uptake through circulation to cells is mediated by
Tf/TfR system. TfR binds to iron-saturated holo-Tf on the cell surface at pH 7.4 and
the TfR-Tf complex is internalized and endocytosed to incorporate Tf-bound ferric

ions (Fe 3+) in endosomes. At a lower pH in the endosomes, Fe 3+ dissociates from Tf
and TfR binds to iron-free apo-Tf without binding to holo-Tf. In the recycling
endosomes, the apo-Tf/TfR complex is then transported back to the cell surface where
apo-Tf is released into the bloodstream. Both TfR and Tf are reused for another cycle
of cellular iron uptake. However, an emerging enigma is that many viruses use the
host gate of iron, TfR, as a means to enter into the cells and TfR is a viral target for
infection

. The entry and infection of a number different types of viruses

including canine parvovirus32, mink enteritis virus33, feline panleukopenia virus32,34,35,
New World hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses36,37, mouse mammary tumor virus38,39,
human and simian immunodeficiency viruses40-42, hepatitis C virus43, human
adenoviruses44 and alphaviruses45 depends on TfR trafficking pathway. Given that TfR
is one of the most highly expressed plasma membrane components, different reports
suggest that TfR an attractive target for the virus to initiate host cell infection. As
illustrated in Fig. 1A-C, an elevated expression level of TfR as well as ACE2 was
found in mouse respiratory tract as compared with other tissues. Moreover, TfR is
ubiquitously expressed thus increasing the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection that
is predominantly transmitted among humans via the respiratory route. More
importantly, SARS-CoV-2 infected ACE2 knockout cells (Fig. 4A-D), suggesting the
presence of another receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry.
TfR directly binds to spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 with a binding affinity of KD
2.95 nM, which falls into a similar range with other binding affinities (31.59-4.67 nM)
between ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV as reported by several studies

Compared with the binding affinity between TfR and intact spike protein, a ~15 fold
decreased binding between TfR and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was found
(KD of 43 nM), suggesting that other part of the spike protein contributes to the
TfR-Spike interaction. The direct TfR-Spike interaction was further confirmed by the
colocalization of TfR and the spike protein both on the cell membranes and in the
cytoplasma. In addition, TfR directly interacted with ACE2 with a binding affinity of
KD 200 nM. In both intact and virus-infected cells, TfR was co-localized with ACE2
on cell membranes but the co-localization was not found in the cytoplasma. In
virus-infected cells, TfR-ACE2-virus and TfR-virus complex was found on the cell
membranes and in the cytoplasma, respectively. No ACE2-virus complex was
observed in the cytoplasma. In addition, hTfR mice are sensitized for SARS-CoV-2
infection (Fig. 5). All the data suggest that TfR-Spike interaction mediates
SARS-CoV-2 entry on the cell membrane and TfR transports the virus into the cells
(Fig. 6E).
As expected, soluble TfR, Tf, anti-TfR antibody or designed peptides
significantly blocked SARS-CoV-2’s entry into the Vero cells by interfering with
TfR-SARS-CoV-2 interaction thus providing strategies for anti-SARS-CoV-2
treatment and for developing potent therapeutic agents. Especially, the anti-viral effect
of 200 nM anti-TfR antibody was comparable to that of high concentration of
Remdeivir (4 μM), providing a potential candidate for anti-viral reagent development.
According to the docking model (Fig. S1-3), TfR binds to the RBD region of the
spike protein interacting with ACE2. The designed peptides (SL8, QK8 and FG8)
