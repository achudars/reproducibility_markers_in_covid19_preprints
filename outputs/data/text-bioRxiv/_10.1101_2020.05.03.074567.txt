Abstract

34

In late December 2019, an emerging viral infection COVID-19 was identified in Wuhan,

35

China, and became a global pandemic. Characterization of the genetic variants of SARS-

36

CoV-2 is crucial in following and evaluating it spread across countries. In this study, we

37

collected and analyzed 3,067 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from 55 countries during the

38

first three months after the onset of this virus. Using comparative genomics analysis, we

39

traced the profiles of the whole-genome mutations and compared the frequency of each

40

mutation in the studied population. The accumulation of mutations during the epidemic

41

period with their geographic locations was also monitored. The results showed 782 variant

42

sites, of which 512 (65.47%) had a non-synonymous effect. Frequencies of mutated alleles

43

revealed the presence of 38 recurrent non-synonymous mutations, including ten hotspot

44

mutations with a prevalence higher than 0.10 in this population and distributed in six

45

SARS-CoV-2 genes. The distribution of these recurrent mutations on the world map

46

revealed certain genotypes specific to the geographic location. We also found co-occurring

47

mutations resulting in the presence of several haplotypes. Moreover, evolution over time

48

has shown a mechanism of mutation co-accumulation which might affect the severity and

49

spread of the SARS-CoV-2.

50

On the other hand, analysis of the selective pressure revealed the presence of negatively

51

selected residues that could be taken into considerations as therapeutic targets

52

We have also created an inclusive unified database (http://genoma.ma/covid-19/) that lists

53

all of the genetic variants of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes found in this study with

54

phylogeographic analysis around the world.

Introduction

65

The recent emergence of the novel, human pathogen Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome

66

Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in China with its rapid international spread poses a global

67

health emergency. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) publicly

68

announced the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic as a global pandemic. As of March 23, 2020, the

69

COVID-19 pandemic had affected more than 190 countries and territories, with more than

70

464,142 confirmed cases and 21,100 deaths (1).

71

The new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA

72

virus belonging to a large family named coronavirus which have been classified under

73

three groups two of them are responsible for infections in mammals (2), such us: bat SARS-

74

CoV-like; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Many recent

75

studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was diverged from bat SARS-CoV-like (3-4).

76

The size of the SARS-CoV2 genome is approximately 30 kb and its genomic structure has

77

followed the characteristics of known genes of Coronavirus; the polyprotein orf1ab also

78

known as the polyprotein replicase covers more than 2 thirds of the total genome size and

79

structural proteins, including spike protein, membrane protein, envelope protein and

80

nucleocapsid protein. In addition ere are also six ORFs (ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b,

81

ORF8 and ORF10) are predicted as hypothetical proteins with no associated function (5).

82

Characterization of viral mutations can provide valuable information for assessing the

83

mechanisms linked to pathogenesis, immune evasion and viral drug resistance. In addition,

84

viral mutation studies can be crucial for the design of new vaccines, antiviral drugs and

85

diagnostic tests. A previous study (6) based on an analysis of 103 genomes of SARS-CoV-

86

2 indicates that this virus has evolved into two main types. Type L being more widespread

87

than type S, and type S representing the ancestral version. In addition, another study (7)

88

conducted on 32 genomes of strains sampled from China, Thailand and the United States

89

between December 24, 2019 and January 23, 2020 suggested increasing tree-like signals

90

from 0 to 8.2%, 18.2% and 25, 4% over time, which may indicate an increase in the genetic

91

diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in human hosts.

92

Therefore, the analysis of mutations and monitoring of the evolutionary capacity of SARS-

93

CoV-2 over time-based on a large population is necessary. In this study, we characterized

94

the genetic variants in 3067 SARS-CoV-2 genomes for a detailed understanding of their

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.03.074567; this version posted May 21, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

95

genetic diversity and to monitor the accumulation of mutations over time with particular

96

focus on the geographic distribution of recurrent mutations. On the other hand, we

97

established selective pressure analysis to predict negatively selected residues which could

98

be useful for the design of therapeutic targets. We have also created a database to share,

99

exploit and research knowledge of genetic variants to facilitate comparison for the COVID-

100

19 scientific community.

101

Materials and Methods

102

Data collection and Variant calling analysis

103

3067 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were collected from the GISAID EpiCovTM (update: 02-

104

04-2020) and NCBI (update: 20-03-2020) databases. Only complete genomes were used

105

in this study (Additional file 1: Table S1). Genomes were mapped to the reference

106

sequence Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 (NC_045512) using Minimap v2.12-r847-dirty (8). The BAM

107

files were sorted by SAMtools sort (9), then used to call the genetic variants in variant call

108

format (VCF) by SAMtools mpileup (9) and bcftools v1.8 (9). The final call set of the 3067

109

genomes, was annotated and their impact was predicted using SnpEff v 4.3t (10). First, the

110

SnpEff databases were built locally using annotations of the reference genome

111

NC_045512.2 obtained in GFF format from the NCBI database. Then, the SnpEff database

112

was used to annotate SNPs and InDels with putative functional effects according to the

113

categories

114

(http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/SnpEff_manual.html).

115

Phylogentic analysis and geodistribution

116

The downloaded full-length genome sequences of coronaviruses isolated from different

117

hosts from public databases were subjected to multiple sequence alignments using Muscle

118

v 3.8 (11). Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees with 1000 bootstrap replicates were

119

constructed using RaxML v 8.2.12 (39)). Heatmap for correlation analysis was performed

120

on countries and hotspots mutations using CustVis with default settings rows scaling =

121

variance scaling, PCA method = SVD with imputation, clustering distance for rows =

122

correlation clustering, the method for rows = average, tree ordering for rows = tightest

125

Selective pressure and modelling

126

We used Hyphy v2.5.8 (13) to estimate synonymous and non-synonymous ratio dN / dS

127

(ω). Two datasets of 191 and 433 for orf1ab and genes respectively were retrieved from

128

Genbank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). After deletion of duplicated and

129

cleaning the sequences, only 91 and 39 for orf1ab and spike proteins, respectively, were

130

used for the analysis (Additional file 1: Table S2). The selected nucleotide sequences of

131

each dataset were aligned using Clustalw codon-by-codon and the phylogenetic tree was

132

obtained using ML (maximum likelihood) available in MEGA X (14). For this analysis,

133

four Hyphy's methods were used to study site-specific selection: SLAC (Single-Likelihood

134

Ancestor Counting (15), FEL (Fixed Effects Likelihood) (15), FUBAR (Fast,

135

Unconstrained Bayesian AppRoximation) (16) and MEME (Mixed Effects Model of

136

Evolution) (17). For all the methods, values supplied by default were used for statistical

137

confirmation and the overall ω value was calculated according to ML trees under General

138

time reversible model (GTR model). The CI- TASSER generated models (https:

139

//zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu / COVID-19 /) of nonstructural proteins (nsp3, nsp4,

140

nsp6, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14 and nsp16 of orf1ab were used to highlight the sites under

141

selective pressure on the protein. On the other hand, the cryo-EM structure with PDB id

142

6VSB was used as a model for the spike protein in its prefusion conformation. Structure

143

visualization and image rendering were performed in PyMOL 2.3 (Schrodinger LLC).

144

Pangenome construction

145

115 proteomes of the genus Betacorononavirus were obtained from the NCBI database

146

(update: 20-03-2020), of which 83 genomes belonged to the SARS-CoV-2 species and the

147

rest distributed to other species of the same genus publicly available (Additional file 2:

148

Table S3). These proteomes were used for the construction of pangenome at the inter-

149

specific scale of Betacoronavirus and intra-genomic of SARS-CoV-2. The strategy of best

150

reciprocal BLAST results (18) was implemented to identify all of the orthologous genes

151

using Proteinortho v6.0b (19). Proteins with an identity above 60% and sequence coverage

152

above 75% with an e-value threshold below 1e-5 were used to be considered as significant

153

hits.

Results

156

SARS-CoV-2 genomes used in this study

157

In this study, we used 3,067 SARS-CoV2 complete genomes collected from GISAID

158

EpiCovTM (update: 02-04-2020) and NCBI (update: 20-03-2020) databases. These strains

159

were isolated from 55 countries (Fig 1A). The most represented origin was American

160

strains with 783 (25.53%), followed by strains from England, Iceland, and China with 407

161

(13.27%), 343 (11.18%), 329 (10.73%), respectively. The date of isolation was during the

162

first three months after the appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, from December 24, 2019,

163

to March 25, 2020 (Fig 1B). Likewise, about two-thirds of these strains collected in this

164

work were isolated during March.

165

Allele frequencies revealed a diversity of genetic variants in six SARS-Cov-2 genes

166

To study and follow the appearance and accumulation of mutations, we have traced the

167

profiles of these mutations and compared their frequencies in the population studied.

168

Remarkably, compared to the Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 reference sequence, a total of 782 variant

169

sites were identified, including 512 (65.47%) non-synonymous mutations, 222 (28.38%)

170

synonymous mutations, and four (0.51% ) deletion mutation effect. The rest (5.64%)

171

distributed to the intergenic regions. Frequency analysis of the mutated alleles revealed the

172

presence of 68 recurrent mutations with a prevalence greater than 0.006 (0.06% of the

173

population), which corresponds to at least 20 / 3,067 genomes of SARS-CoV-2. Focusing

174

on recurrent non-synonymous mutations, 38 was found and distributed in six genes with

175

variable frequencies (Fig 2), of which the gene coding for replicase polyprotein (orf1ab),

176

spike protein, membrane glycoprotein, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, ORF3a, and ORF8.

177

Overall, orf1ab harbored more non-synonymous mutations compared to the other five

178

genes with 22 mutations, including three mutations located in nsp12-RNA- dependent

179

RNA polymerase (RdRp) (M4555T, T4847I and T5020I), three in nsp13-helicase

180

(V5661A, P5703L and M5865V), two in nsp5-main proteinase (G3278S and K3353R),

181

two in nsp15-EndoRNAse (I6525T, Ter6668W), two in nsp3-multi domains (A876T and

182

T1246I), one in nsp14-exonuclease (S5932F) and one in nsp4-transmembrane domain 2

183

(F3071Y). Likewise, spike protein harbored three frequent mutations, including V483A in

184

receptor-binding domain (RBD). The rest of the mutations were found in nucleocapsid

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.03.074567; this version posted May 21, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

185

phosphoprotein (S193I, S194L, S197L, S202N, R203K and G204R), ORF3a (S193I,

186

S194L, S197L, S202N, R203K and G204R), membrane glycoprotein (D3G and T175M)

187

and ORF8 (V62L and L84S).

188

Identification of ten hyper-variable genomic hotspot in SARS-CoV-2 genomes

189

Interestingly, among all recurrent mutations, ten were found as hotspot mutations with a

190

frequency greater than 0.10 in this study population (Fig 2). The most represented was

191

D614G mutation at spike protein with 43.46% (n = 1.333) of the genomes, the second was

192

L84S (at ORF8) found in 23.21% (n = 712). Thus, the gene coding for orf1ab had four

193

mutations hotspots, including S5932F of nsp14-exonuclease, M5865V of nsp13 helicase

194

L3606F of nsp6 transmembrane domain and T265I of nsp2 found with 17.02%, 16.56%,

195

14.38% and 10.66% of the total genomes, respectively. For the four other hotspot mutations

196

were distributed in ORF3a (Q57H and G251V) and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (R203K

197

and G204R).

198

Geographical distribution and origin of mutations worldwide

199

3067 genomes were dispersed in different countries with different genotype profiles. We

200

performed a geo-referencing mutation analysis to identify region-specific loci.

201

Remarkably, China and USA were the countries with the highest number of mutations 301

202

and 296 (38,19 % and 37,56 % of the total number of mutations) including 140 (17,76%)

203

and 229 (29%) singleton mutations specific to China and USA genomes respectively,

204

followed by Malaysia and France with 3,6% and 2,4%, respectively.

205

It is interesting to note that among the 55 countries, 21 harbored singleton mutations.

206

(Additional file 3: Table S4) illustrates the detailed singleton mutations found in these

207

countries. The majority of the genomes analyzed carried more than one mutation.

208

However, among the recurrent non-synonymous, synonymous, deletion and intergenic

209

mutations, we found G251V (in ORF3a), and S5932F (in ORF1ab) present on all

210

continents except Africa (Fig 3). While F924F, L4715L (in orf1ab), D614G (in spike)

211

appeared in all strains except those from Asia. In Algeria, the genomes harbored mutations

212

very similar to those in Europe, including two recurrent mutations T265I and Q57H of the

213

ORF3a. Likewise, the European and Dutch genomes also shared ten recurrent

214

mutations. On the other hand, continent-specific mutations have also been observed, for

215

example in America, we found seven mutations shared in almost all genomes. Besides, two

216

mutations at positions 28117 and 28144 were shared by the Asian genomes, while four

217

different positions 1059, 14408, 23403, 25563 and 1397, 11083, 28674, 29742 were shared

218

by African and Australian genomes (Supplementary material). The majority of these

219

mutations are considered to be transition mutations with a high ratio of A substituted by G.

220

The genome variability was more visible in China and USA than in the rest of the world.

221

SARS-CoV-2 genomes also harbored three co-occurrent mutations R203K, R203R and

222

G204R in the N protein and were present in all continents except Africa and Asia (besides

223

Taiwan).

224

Evolution of mutations over time

225

We selected the genomes of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during the first three months after the

226

emergence of this virus (December 24 to March 25). We have noticed that the mutations

227

have accumulated at a relatively constant rate (Fig 4). The strains selected at the end of

228

March showed a slight increase in the accumulation of mutations with an average of 11.34

229

mutations per genome, compared to the gnomes of February, December and January with

230

an average number of mutations of 9.26, 10.59 and 10.34 respectively. The linear curve in

231

Figure 5 suggests a continuous accumulation of SNPs in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the

232

coming months. This pointed out that many countries had multiple entries for this virus

233

that could be claimed. Thus in the deduced network demonstrated transmission routes in

234

different countries.

235

The study of mutations accumulation over time showed a higher number of mutations in

236

the middle of the outbreak (end of January). At the same time, an increase in the number

237

of mutations in early April was also observed. The first mutations to appear were mainly

238

located in the intergenic region linked to the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and the orf8

239

protein. The T265I, D614G and L84S hotspot mutations located in orf1ab and Spike

240

proteins respectively were introduced into the virus for the first time in late February.

241

Phylogeographical analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes

242

The phylogenetic tree based on the whole genome alignment demonstrates that SARS-

243

CoV-2 is wildly disseminated across distinct geographical location. The results showed

244

that several strains are closely related even though they belong to different countries.

245

Which indicate likely transfer events and identify routes for geographical dissemination.

246

For phylogenetic tree (http://genoma.ma/covid-19/) showed multiple introduction dates of

247

the virus inside the USA with the first haplotype introduced related to the second epidemic

248

wave in China.

249

Using correlation analysis between most recurrent mutations and countries distribution

250

(Fig 5). We observed that most recurrent mutations clusters could be divided into four

251

groups; the bigger cluster compromised nine mutations from the ten hotspots, while the

252

first cluster harbored only the orf1ab mutation L3606F.

253

Meanwhile, geo clustering by geographic location showed two distinct clusters (Fig 5),

254

cluster A grouping countries from Europe with those from America and Africa. However,

255

Asia was only represented by Saudi Arabia. Cluster B in the other hand contained the

256

majority of countries from the Asian and Australian continents. it is also harboring a sub-

257

cluster containing the UK, USA, and Ireland which was previously demonstrated to contain

258

a high number of mutations.

259

On the other hand, mutations as V378I and L3606F (in orfab1), 29742 C>T (intergenic),

260

L139L in (in nucleocapside) were mainly correlated with Pakistan, Norway, Georgia,

261

Taiwan, Kuwait, Australia, and Turkey while (S2839S, F3071Y and T4847I ), D128D and

262

G196V mutations in orf1ab, nucleocapsid, ORF3a , respectively, were mainly present in

263

Spain, Chile, and Greece. However, cluster harboring D614G (in spike), F924F (in orf1ab),

264

and L4715L (in orf1ab) mutations, showed no correlation and were scatted through

265

all countries especially those from Europe. A high correlation with a specific mutation was

266

observed within Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Iceland, UK, USA, Colombia, Ecuador,

267

Vietnam, Japan genomes.

268

Selective pressure analysis

269

Selective pressure on orf1ab, gene harbored a high rate of mutations and on the Spike gene,

270

indicated a single alignment-wide ω ratio of 0.571391 and 0.75951 for spike and or1ab,

271

respectively. Most sites for both genes had ω <1 values, indicating purifying selection. In

272

orf1ab, we estimated eight sites under negative selection pressure (696, 1171, 2923, 3003,

273

3715, 5221, 5704 and 6267) and three sites under positive selection pressure (1473, 2244

274

and 3090). For spike, we found seven sites under negative selection pressure (215, 474,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.03.074567; this version posted May 21, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

275

541, 809, 820, 921 and 1044), and only one site under negative selection pressure (Table

276

1).

277

The modelling results of orf1ab showed that the sites with positive selections were

278

distributed in nsp3 and nsp4, while the negatively selected codons were located in nsp3,

279

nsp4, nsp6, nsp12, nsp13, nsp14 and nsp16 (Fig 6). In spike, the only negatively selected

280

residue was observed in the RBD region (Fig 7).

Inter and intra-specific pan-genome analysis

282

In order to highlight the structural proteins shared at the inter-specific scale between the

283

isolates of the genus Betacoronavirus, thus at the intra-genomic scale of SARS-CoV-2, we

284

have constructed a pan-genome by clustering the sets of proteins encoded in 115 genomes

285

available publicly in NCBI (update: 20-03-2020), including 83 genomes of SARS-Cov-2

286

and the rest distributed to other species of the same genus. Overall, a total of 1,190 proteins

287

were grouped into a pangenome of 94 orthologous cluster proteins (Additional file 2:

288

Table S3), of which ten proteins cluster were shared between SARS-CoV-2 and only three

289

species of the genus Betacoronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13, SARS-CoV and Bat Hp-

290

betacoronavirus/ Zhejiang2013). Of these, BatCoV RaTG13 had more orthologous

291

proteins shared with SARS-CoV-2, followed by SARS-CoV with ten and nine orthologous

292

proteins, respectively (Fig 8A). It is interesting to note that among all the strains used of

293

Betacoronavirus, the ORF8 protein was found in orthology only between SARS-RATG13

294

and SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the ORF10 protein was found as a singleton for SARS-

295

CoV-2.

296

On the other hand, the analysis of the pangenome at the intra-genomic scale of 83 isolates

297

of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig 8B), showed that ORF7b and ORF10 were two accessory proteins

298

(proteins variable) in SARS-CoV- 2 genomes, while the other proteins belonged to the core

299

proteins of SARS-CoV-2 (conserved in all genomes).

Discussion

301

The rate of mutations results in viral evolution and variability in the genome, thus allowing

302

viruses to escape host immunity, as well as drugs (20). Initial published data suggests that

303

SARS-CoV-2 is genetically stable (21) which may increase the effectiveness of vaccines

304

under development. The study on the genomic variation of SARS- CoV- 2 is very

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.03.074567; this version posted May 21, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

305

important for the investigation of pathogenesis, disease course, prevention, and treatment

306

of SARS- CoV- 2 infection. In this study, we characterized the genetic variations in a large

307

population of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Our results showed a diversity of mutations detected

308

with different frequencies. Overall, more than 500 non-synonymous mutations in SARS-

309

CoV-2 genomes have been identified. The orf1ab gene having more than half the size of

310

the SARS-CoV-2 genome and is divided into 16 nsp (nsp1-nsp16) (22). We found more

311

than half of recurrent mutations in orf1ab, and a high mutation rate in nsp3, nsp12 and

312

nsp2, with 124, 57 and 46, respectively. Nsp2 and nsp3 were both essential for correcting

313

viral replication errors (23). Thus, recent studies have suggested that mutations falling in

314

the endosome - associated - protein - like domain of the nsp2, could explain why this virus

315

is more contagious than SARS (24).

316

The replication enzymes nsp12 to nsp16 have been reported as antiviral targets for SARS-

317

CoV (25). In the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we found that nsp12 to nsp15 harbored nine

318

recurrent non-synonymous mutations. Among them, eight identified as new mutations,

319

including three in nsp12-RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (M4555T, T4847I and

320

T5020I), three in nsp13-Helicase (V5661A, P5703L and M5865V) and two in nsp15-

321

EndoRNAse (I6525T and Ter6668W). However, these new mutations must be taken into

322

account when developing a vaccine using the orf1ab protein sequences as a therapeutic

323

target.

324

A high number of mutations were identified in the spike protein, an important determinant

325

in pathogenicity that allows the virion attachment to the cell membrane by interacting with

326

the host ACE2 receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) (26). Among all the frequent

327

mutations in this protein, the V483A mutation has been identified in this receptor and found

328

mainly in SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from USA. This result is consistent with the

329

study of Junxian et al. (27). Eight stains from china, USA and France harbored V367F

330

mutation previously described to enhance the affinity with ACE2 receptor (27).

331

Interestingly, ten hyper variable genomic hotspots with high frequencies of mutated allel

332

detected. Among them, position 11083 (L3606F) detected in NSP6, this protein works with

333

nsp3 and nsp4 by forming double-membrane vesicles and convoluted membranes involved

334

in viral replication (28). Besides, three positions were previously reported by Pachetti et

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.03.074567; this version posted May 21, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

335

al. (2020), of which the two positions 17858 (M5865V) and 18060 (S5932F) in ORF1ab,

336

and 28881 (R203K) in nucleocapside. Moreover, intraspecies pangenome analysis of

337

SARS- CoV-2 showed that the six of the genes harboring hotspot mutations belong to the

338

core genome.

339

Thus, under normal circumstances genomic variation increase the viruses spread and

340

pathogenicity. This happens when the virus accumulated mutation enabling its virulence

341

potential (29). Genomic comparison of the studied population allowed us to gain insights

342

into virus mutations occurrence over time and within different geographic areas. In the

343

SARS-CoV virus, the SNP distribution is not random, and it is more dominant in critical

344

genes for the virus (20,30). Our results confirmed what was previously described and

345

elucidate the presence of numerous hotspot mutations. Besides, co-occurrence mutations

346

were also common in different countries all along with singleton mutations. In the case of

347

the China, the singleton mutations are driven by the single group that diverged differently

348

due to the environment, the host, and the number of generations. These mutations are due

349

to the low fidelity of reverse transcriptase (29, 31).

350

China, US, France and Malaysia contain a high number of specific mutations which may

351

be the cause of a rapid transmission, especially in the US. These specific mutations may

352

also be correlated with the critical condition in US and France.

353

The clustering of these genomes revealed the spread of clades to diverse geographical

354

regions. We observed an increase of mutations over time following the first dissemination

355

event from China. Specific haplotypes were also predominant to a geographical location,

356

especially in the China. This study opens up new perspectives to determine whether one of

357

these frequent mutations will lead to biological differences and their correlation with

358

different mortality rates.

359

Among the seven nsp of or1ab hosting sites under selective pressure, only nsp3 and nsp4

360

contains both residues under positive and negative selection. The modelling of nsp3

361

domains shows that only the negative selection site 1171 (Thr- 353), was located at the

362

conserved macro domain Mac1 (previously X or ADP-ribose 1" phosphatase) (32). This

363

domain has been previously shown to be dispensable for RNA replication in the context of

364

a SARS-CoV replicon (33). However, it could counteract the host's innate immune

365

response (34). It was proposed that the 3Ecto luminal domain of nsp3 interacts with the

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.03.074567; this version posted May 21, 2020. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

366

large luminal domain of nsp4 (residues 112-164) to induce discrete membrane formations

367

as an important step in the generation of ER viral replication organelles (35, 36). As we

368

have shown previously by the FEL, MEME and FUBAR methods, the orf1ab 2244 site

369

coding for ILE-1426 is under positive selection pressure and since it is located on the

370

luminal 3ecto domain of the nsp3 protein, this can be explained by a possible host influence

371

on the virus in this domain.The results of selective pressure analysis revealed the presence

372

of several negatively selected residues, one of which is located at the receptor-binding

373

domain (GLN-474) and which is known by its interaction with the GLN24 residue of the

374

human ACE2 (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor (37). In general, it is well-

375

known that negatively selected sites could indicate a functional constraint and could be

376

useful for drug or vaccine target design, given their conserved nature and therefore less

377

likely to change (38).

378

Conclusion

379

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused a very large impact on health and economy

380

worldwide. Therefore, understanding genetic diversity and virus evolution become a

381

priority in the fight against the disease. Our results show several molecular facets of the

382

relevance of this virus. We have shown that recurrent mutations are distributed mainly in

383

six SARS-CoV-2 genes with variable mutated allele frequencies. We were able to highlight

384

an increase in mutations accumulation overtime and revealed the existence of three major

385

clades in various geographic regions. Finally, the study allowed us to identify specific

386

haplotypes by geographic location and provides a list of sites under selective pressure that

387

could serve as an interesting avenue for future studies.

distribution of the analyzed genomes. The correlation was applied to a data set of 69
most recurrent mutations with different distribution in all 56 countries divided into two
distinct cluster A and B. The color scale indicates the significance of correlation with blue
and orange colors indicating the highest and lowest correlation. The red, yellow and orange
colors in the horizontal bar represent the continent of origin.

positive and negative selection is highlighted in blue and red respectively. The modeling
of orf1ab non-structural proteins (NSP3, NSP4, NSP6, NSP12, NSP13, NSP14, and
NSP16) harboring residues under pressure selection was produced using CI-TASSER. A.
The NSP3 domains MAC1, Ubl1, Ubl2-PLpro, and SUD-C are color-coded in the 3D
representation. The residues Ile-1426 and Ala-655 under negative selection are located
