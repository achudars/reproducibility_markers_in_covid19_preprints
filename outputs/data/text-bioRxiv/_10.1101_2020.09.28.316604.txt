Characterizing key molecular and cellular pathways involved in COVID-19 is essential for
disease prognosis and management. We perform shotgun transcriptome sequencing of human
RNA obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs of patients with COVID-19, and identify a
molecular signature associated with disease severity. Specifically, we identify globally
dysregulated immune related pathways, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor signaling,
complement and coagulation cascades, JAK-STAT, and TGF- β signaling pathways in all,
though to a higher extent in patients with severe symptoms. The excessive release of
cytokines and chemokines such as CCL2, CCL22, CXCL9 and CXCL12 and certain
interferons and interleukins related genes like IFIH1, IFI44, IFIT1 and IL10 were
significantly higher in patients with severe clinical presentation compared to mild and
moderate presentations. Moreover, early induction of the TGF- β signaling pathway might be
the primary cause of pulmonary fibrosis in patients with severe disease. Differential gene
expression analysis identified a small set of regulatory genes that might act as strong
predictors of patient outcome. Our data suggest that rapid transcriptome analysis of
nasopharyngeal swabs can be a powerful approach to quantify host molecular response and
may provide valuable insights into COVID-19 pathophysiology.

Introduction
Since the first case reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2 has spread very
quickly across 188 different countries leading to over 31,887,485 COVID-19 cases and
976,789 associated deaths worldwide as of 24th September 2020.1 The common signs and
symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and chest CT
abnormalities.2 Some patients with COVID-19 quickly develop severe pulmonary symptoms
including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary edema, intense kidney
injury and multiple organ failure3 whereas other patients present with no symptoms or with
only mild disease.4 Pathogen load and prevalence of infections are higher in males than
females demonstrating that sex physiology plays a role in infectious disease pathogenesis.5
Meng and colleagues6 showed that men who died of COVID-19 had elevated levels of
systemic inflammatory markers such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and C-reactive
protein. Nevertheless, the mechanism behind increased mortality among older adults and
males with COVID-19 remains speculative.
Despite the worldwide spreading, the host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection
remains poorly characterized. Dysregulation of host immune response and activation of
inflammatory cytokines, known as the "cytokine storm", is associated with disease severity
and poor prognosis.7,

8, 9

A recent host transcriptome study on patients with COVID-19

revealed distinct host inflammatory cytokine profiles and highlighted the association between
SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and excessive release of cytokine such as CCL2/MCP-1,
CXCL10/IP-10, CCL3/MIP-1A, and CCL4/MIP1B.10 Additionally, Lieberman et al. showed
upregulation of antiviral factors such as OAS1-3 and IFIT1-3, and Th1 chemokines
CXCL9/10/11 upon SARS-CoV2 induced antiviral response. This study also showed immune
responses may underlie disparities between males and females, and among the elderly
compared to younger age groups.11
At present, it is not known if the host gene expression profile varies among patients with
mild, moderate, or severe clinical outcomes. Identification of such transcriptomic differences
can be useful for predicting COVID-19 outcomes and for better management and earlier
interventions especially for patient groups with severe outcomes. In this study, we performed
RNA sequencing on nasopharyngeal tissue of patients with mild, moderate, and severe
disease to characterize transcriptomic regulation and immune response differences among

these patients, and to identify markers for early identification of patients with possible severe
disease outcomes.

Methods
Patient cohort and ethics statement
This study was approved by the Dubai Scientific Research Ethics Committee - Dubai Health
Authority (approval number #DSREC-04/2020_02). The Ethics committee waived the
requirement for informed consent since this study was part of a public health surveillance and
outbreak investigation in the UAE. The electronic medical records of patients with laboratory
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were reviewed and important clinical data were extracted using the
World Health Organization (WHO) case report form.
Sample preparation, RNA isolation, library construction and sequencing
RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini or the
213 EZ1 DSP Virus Kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). All patients in this study tested positive
for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR performed at Dubai Health Authority Hospitals. RNA
libraries were then prepared for shotgun transcriptome sequencing using the TruSeq Stranded
Total RNA Library kit from Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) as previously described.12,13,14
Libraries were then sequenced using the NovaSeq SP Reagent kit (2 X 150 cycles) from
Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) to generate a minimum of 15M reads per sample
(Supplementary Table 1).
Data analysis
The sequencing read quality was checked using FastQC v0.11.815 and MultiQC v1.6.16 High
quality reads (Q ≥ 30) were first mapped to rRNA sequences to remove potential rRNA reads
using hisat v2-2.1.017 with the default parameter. The remaining reads were then mapped to
the GRCh37 (hg19). The unmapped reads were then mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 genome
(GenBank Accession number: NC_045512.2) using BWA v0.7.17. PCR duplicates were
removed with Picard MarkDuplicates program v2.18.17.18 Samples with more than 6M reads
aligned to the GRCh37 (hg19) were considered for further analysis. RNA sequencing data
obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs of samples confirmed to be COVID-19 negative by RTqPCR, hereafter referred to as controls (n = 32), were downloaded from GSE152075.11

The number of reads mapped to each gene in the genome (GRCh37) was calculated using the
FeatureCounts program in the SubReads package v2.0.1.19 DESeq2 package v1.28.120 was
applied to perform batch effects and normalization. In brief, DESeq2 uses the median of
ratios method to normalize data and estimate size factors (which control for differences in the
library size of the sequencing experiment). Further, gene expression change was calculated
with respect to control for each groups using Wald test and p-values and log2 fold change was
extracted. The resulting genes p-value was adjusted using the Benjamini and Hochberg
method. These adjusted p-value (adj p-value) are calculated as: gene p-value × (m/i))
where m is the total number of genes, i is the gene p-value rank. Here we have considered a
fraction of 5% false positives acceptable hence the genes with adj p-value < 0.05 were called
as significant.
Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using the clusterProfiler package v 3.16.021 to
identify shared pathways among DEGs. Pathways with adj p-value < 0.05 were reported as
significant. Heatmaps were generated using Morpheus22 and volcano plots were generated
using VolcaNoseR package.23 Both case and control sequencing data were normalized to
counts per million (CPM), which is calculated by normalizing the read counts for a given
gene by the total counts per sample. CPM values were used to compare expression between
certain genes and violin plots were generated using GraphPad Prism v8.0.

Results

Patient Cohort
Our patient cohort consisted of fifty patients with COVID-19 (36% female) who tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR with a mean age of 40.9 years (ranging from 3 – 70
years) at diagnosis. Cases were categorized into mild, moderate, and severe as previously
described.12 Briefly, mild cases were asymptomatic or had mild non-life-threatening
symptoms, while moderate cases presented with symptoms (such as persistent fever)
requiring medical attention and/or hospitalization. Severe cases presented with advanced
disease and pneumonia requiring admission to intensive care units and life-support treatment
(such as mechanical ventilation). In total, 37 patients (21 males and 16 females; mean age

36.4 years) had mild disease, 10 patients (9 males and 1 female; mean age 49.3 years) had
moderate presentations, while 3 patients (2 males and 1 female; mean age 68.0 years) had
severe/critical disease. All patients were non-smokers. All 3 patients with severe disease had
chronic health issues (hypertension, chronic kidney disease and/or diabetes mellitus) (Table
1).

Global transcriptomic changes in patients with COVID-19

To understand the host mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infections, we explored transcriptomic
profiling of patients with COVID-19 using RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal samples (see
Methods). We first mapped high quality reads to the human genome and the SARS-CoV-2
genome (GenBank accession number: NC_045512.2) and summarized sequencing statistics
in Supplementary Table 1. On average, ~2% (ranging from 0.1% - 13.6%) of the reads
mapped to the SARS-CoV-2 genome confirming the presence of the virus, albeit coverage
over the viral genome varied across patients most likely due to differences in viral loads. On
the other hand, ~65% (ranges from 24.3% - 91.0%) of the RNA reads mapped to the human
genome, enabling host transcriptomic analysis.

To detect global signature genes in patients with COVID-19 we combined transcriptomic
data from patients with mild, moderate, and severe disease and made a comprehensive cohort
called “COVID” to compare against controls for DEG analysis (see Methods). We detected
3572 upregulated genes and 445 downregulated genes with adj p-value<0.05 and foldchangecutoff >2. Several interferon, cytokine and immune-related genes, such as CXCL5,
CXCL12, CCL2, IFIH1, IFI44, IFIT1 and IL10 were upregulated, whereas metabolic
pathways or housekeeping genes, like RPL41, RPL17, SLC25A6, CALM1 and TUBA1A, were
downregulated (Figure 2).

Pathway enrichment analysis of the DEGs was performed to interrogate signaling programs
induced by SARS-CoV-2. Up-regulated genes were related to cytokine-cytokine receptor
interaction, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, complement and coagulation cascades and other
inflammatory pathways. Whereas, several metabolic pathways were negatively enriched,
including ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation and ER protein processing, which suggests a
global reduction in the production of proteins related to cellular energy production (Figure
2).

Transcriptome analysis of patients with mild, moderate and severe COVID-19

Next, we compared the transcriptomic profiles of patients with mild, moderate, and severe
disease each separately with controls to determine if the above global signature, and the
identified cytokine storm, hold similarly or varies by disease severity. Overall, we detected
2240 upregulated and 422 downregulated genes in mildly, 3447 upregulated and 302
downregulated genes in moderately, and 2691 upregulated and 215 downregulated genes in
severely ill patient samples. Most of the immune response genes were significantly
upregulated in all patient groups (Supplementary Figure 1).

Furthermore, pathway enrichment analysis showed modulation, to varying extents (Figure
3), of several overlapping pathways among mildly, moderately, and severely affected patients
(Supplementary Figure 1). In addition to upregulation of immune-related response genes,
there was consistent disruption of the ribosome pathway. The SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is
an interferon-regulated gene and is upregulated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.25 We
also found that ACE2 expression was highest in patients with severe disease compared to
patients with mild and moderate disease (Figure 3).

Comparison of functional enrichment among patients with mild, moderate, and severe
COVID-19

To further delineate the differences among these groups, we compared the expression levels
of genes and associated pathways (complement and coagulation cascades, cytokine-cytokine
receptor interaction, JAK STAT signaling, TGF beta signaling pathway, platelets activation
and ribosome pathway) between patients with mild, moderate, and severe disease. Gene
expression in most regulated pathways was significantly higher (adj p-value < 0.05) in
patients with severe disease compared to those with mild or moderate disease (Figure 3). For
example, expression of certain interleukins (such as IL11, IL12, IL19, IL34), interleukin
receptors (like IL10RA, IL21R and IL11RA), chemokines and tumour necrosis factor genes
(such as CXCL12, CXCL9, CCL25, CCL2, CCR5, CCR7, TNFSF9, TNFSF15, TNFRSF25

and TNFRSF9) were significantly higher in patients with severe disease compared to patients
with mild or moderate disease (adj p-value < 0.05; Figure 3). Furthermore, complement and
coagulation cascades (e.g. C2, C5, C6, F12 and F8) were activated to a higher extent in
patients with severe disease. Finally, patients with severe disease had higher expression of
STAT4, STAT5A and STAT5B which are important components of JAK-STAT pathway and
play a critical role in the fate of T helper cells26.

The highest fold change (> 2) in patients with severe disease was among the proinflammatory cytokines and chemokine receptors CCR1 (CXCL8/CXCL6 receptor), CCR6,

β signaling genes BMP2, BMP7,

CCR22, CCR25, IL3RA, IL11, IL19, and IL21RA, the TGF-

PDGFA, and TNFSF11, and the complement and platelet cascade genes C6, C7, F2, F5,
SERPINC1, and SERPIND1 (Figure 4). This distinction is likely due to viral infection
resulting in release of inflammatory responses to a higher extent in patients with severe
disease as compared to patients with mild or moderate disease.
Finally, we compared transcriptomic changes in male and female COVID-19 patients with
mild and moderate outcomes. Several immune related genes (CSF2, TNFSF11, TNFRSF11B,
IL18R1, IFIT1B and C4BPA) were upregulated in male patients compared to females (Figure
5).

Discussion
Transcriptomic analysis of nasopharyngeal tissues from patients with COVID-19 reveals a
robust early induction of cytokine and immune-related profiles by SARS-CoV-2 infection. In
addition, elevated levels of complement and coagulation cascades were seen. Our findings are
similar to those recently observed by Butler et al.27 in New York (United States) and Qin et
al.28 in Wuhan (China). The latter work reported that an increase in ‘serum’ cytokine and
chemokine levels, as well as in neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratio (NLR) in SARS-CoV-2 infected
patients is correlated with the severity of the disease and adverse outcomes, suggesting a role
for hyper-inflammatory responses in COVID-19 pathogenesis. Similarly, inflammationinduced coagulation pathways, which can themselves be regulated by the complement
system, are pivotal in controlling pathogenesis associated with infections.29
Our RNA work, using nasopharyngeal tissue, extends those findings to show that those
pathways are more significantly altered in patients with severe disease outcomes.

Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 seems to induce expression of certain genes (Figure 4) to higher
extents in patients with severe, compared to those with mild or moderate disease. This finding
has direct prognostic and therapeutic implications. Identifying molecules targeting the
pathways where those genes are involved might help ameliorate or avoid adverse clinical
outcomes due to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, this early expression signature can be used to
predict the clinical course of disease, so that required early interventions can be implemented.
However, larger datasets are needed to validate this expression signature and to show that it
can reliably predict disease outcomes in the general population.
Certain molecular pathways require specific attention. In the majority of patients with
COVID-19, respiratory failure is the primary cause of death and is often associated with
uncontrolled inflammatory responses, edema, and lung fibrosis.30 This lung fibrosis is mainly
triggered by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β).10 In our analysis, the TGF-β pathway
was significantly upregulated in patients with severe disease suggesting they are more prone
to respiratory failure. The PI3K/Akt and JAK/STAT signaling pathways are two other
noteworthy pathways given that several cellular and immune responses, including host cell
immune response to counteract viral infection

31

, activation of interferon-stimulated genes

32

(ISGs) , and activation of several regulatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines33 converge on
those two pathways.
Our gender-specific transcriptomic analysis revealed a few genes which were upregulated in
male patients compared to females (Figure 5). It is highly likely that many other key factors,
which are involved in sex-specific responses to SARS-CoV-2, were not detected in our study.
It is possible that our cohort was not large enough to perform appropriate comparisons on a
large number of patients adequately stratified for age, sex, and disease severity.
Taken together, our study highlights key molecular and functional pathways involved in
COVID-19 pathogenesis and characterizes a specific early expression signature associated
with severe disease outcomes due to SARS-CoV-2.

than 1 and a p-adjusted value of less than 0.05. For every gene in a given pathway, the
average counts per million (CPM) was calculated in cases with mild, moderate and severe
disease and these CPM values were plotted (Violin plots) indicating median and quartiles as
well as minima and maxima bounds. *Expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.
