Summary

20

SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via its spike glycoprotein which must be cleaved sequentially at the

21

S1/S2, then the S2’ cleavage sites (CS) to mediate membrane fusion. SARS-CoV-2 has a unique

22

polybasic insertion at the S1/S2 CS, which we demonstrate can be cleaved by furin. Using lentiviral

23

pseudotypes and a cell-culture adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus with a S1/S2 deletion, we show that the

24

polybasic insertion is selected for in lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cultures but

25

selected against in Vero E6, a cell line used for passaging SARS-CoV-2. We find this selective advantage

26

depends on expression of the cell surface protease, TMPRSS2, that allows virus entry independent of

27

endosomes thus avoiding antiviral IFITM proteins. SARS-CoV-2 virus lacking the S1/S2 furin CS was

28

shed to lower titres from infected ferrets and was not transmitted to cohoused sentinel animals. Thus,

29

the polybasic CS is a key determinant for efficient SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Introduction

32

In 2019, a respiratory epidemic of unknown aetiology emerged in Hubei Province, China. The

33

cause of the outbreak was quickly identified as a novel betacoronavirus, closely related to severe acute

34

respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and named SARS-CoV-2 (P. Zhou et al., 2020; N. Zhu et

35

al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible between humans and by the middle of March, the WHO

36

declared the outbreak a pandemic (Holshue et al., 2020). It is vital to understand which molecular

37

features of SARS-CoV-2 led to the virus causing a pandemic in order to control both the current

38

pandemic and to prevent future coronavirus pandemics.

39

Coronaviruses enter host cells via their spike glycoprotein. Like many other enveloped virus

40

glycoproteins, the spike protein is synthesised as a precursor that must be cleaved in order to perform

41

its membrane fusogenic activity. Depending on the sequence of spike at the S1/S2 junction, the

42

cleavage occurs during trafficking of spike in the producer cell by host furin-like enzymes, or by serine-

43

proteases such as the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) at the cell surface after

44

attachment, or by cathepsin proteases in the late endosome/lysosome (Matsuyama et al., 2010;

45

Simmons et al., 2005). Upon cleavage of the S1/S2 junction and engagement of the host cell receptor

46

with the spike receptor binding domain (RBD), a second cleavage site (CS) becomes exposed within

47

the S2 domain, termed the S2’ site (Belouzard, Chu, & Whittaker, 2009; Millet & Whittaker, 2014).

48

Upon cleavage of the S2’ site, generally by serine proteases or cathepsins, the S2 fusion peptide is

49

liberated and initiates viral-host membrane fusion (Belouzard et al., 2009).

50

Like the closely related SARS-CoV, the cognate receptor of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is

51

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)(W. Li et al., 2003; P. Zhou et al., 2020). While the SARS-CoV

52

S1/S2 junction is well characterised as being cleaved by serine proteases or cathepsins, the SARS-CoV-

53

2 spike, similarly to the more distantly related Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome-related

54

coronavirus (MERS-CoV), contains a polybasic CS, described as being a suboptimal furin CS (Coutard

55

et al., 2020; Millet & Whittaker, 2014; Shang et al., 2020). This polybasic CS is absent from the closest

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.30.318311; this version posted September 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this

56

relatives of SARS-CoV-2, such as SARS-CoV, although similar polybasic CS are found in more distantly

57

related coronaviruses (Andersen, Rambaut, Lipkin, Holmes, & Garry, 2020; Boni et al., 2020; Le

58

Coupanec et al., 2015). It has previously been demonstrated for the MERS-CoV spike, and for SARS-

59

CoV-2, that the furin CS at the S1/S2 junction may promote entry into lung cells (Hoffmann, Kleine-

60

Weber, & Pohlmann, 2020; Park et al., 2016). Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 has been shown in multiple

61

independent studies to rapidly lose this polybasic CS upon passage in Vero E6 cells, which has been a

62

popular cell line for isolating and propagating the virus (Davidson et al., 2020; Klimstra et al., 2020; Z.

63

Liu et al., 2020; Ogando et al., 2020; Sasaki et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2020; Y. Zhu et al., 2020). In

64

addition, there are reports of CS mutants isolated directly from clinical swabs (Z. Liu et al., 2020; Wong

65

et al., 2020). Several different mutants in this region are described including total deletions of the CS,

66

loss of arginine mutations within the CS making it less polybasic, or deletions of flanking regions

67

leaving the polybasic tract intact but potentially affecting accessibility to protease.

68

In this study, we use a combination of lentiviral pseudotypes with spike CS mutations and Vero

69

passaged SARS-CoV-2 virus variants to investigate the molecular mechanism by which the polybasic

70

CS of SARS-CoV-2 mediates efficient entry into lung cells. We describe the biological consequences of

71

these mutations and test the effect of these mutations on viral transmission in ferrets.

72

Results

73

The polybasic S1/S2 cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is cleaved by furin

74

To investigate the importance of the spike polybasic CS of SARS-CoV-2 (PRRAR), a number of

75

spike mutants were generated which were predicted to modulate the efficiency of furin cleavage

76

(Figure 1A) including: substituting two of the upstream arginines to produce a monobasic CS similar

77

to SARS-CoV spike (monoCS), replacing the tribasic CS with the furin CS of a highly pathogenic H5N1

78

avian influenza haemagglutinin containing a string of seven basic amino acids (H5CS), and two

79

naturally occurring deletions seen following passage in Vero E6 cells and/or in clinical isolates

80

(Davidson et al., 2020; Lau et al., 2020). The first of these removes eight amino acids including all 3

81

arginines of the PRRAR site (ΔCS) – while the other removes five flanking amino acids but retains the

82

tribasic site (Δflank). The mutations were engineered into a cDNA encoding the spike to enable cell

83

surface expression and the generation of lentiviral pseudotypes (PV) that carry each spike variant. In

84

addition, to study the importance of the PRRAR motif in the context of live virus we took advantage

85

of a naturally occurring Vero cell adapted mutant SARS-CoV-2 isolate, ΔCS (Davidson et al., 2020). This

86

variant and the wild type virus from which it was derived were cloned by limiting dilution to enable

87

studies using individual genotypes.

88

In several previous studies, the ability of coronavirus spike proteins to be cleaved by furin has

89

been correlated with the ability to generate syncytia at neutral pHs when overexpressed (Belouzard

90

et al., 2009; Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, & Pohlmann, 2020; Xia et al., 2020). The library of SARS-CoV-2

91

mutant spike proteins were transiently expressed in Vero E6 cells, which do no express TMPRSS2

92

(Bertram et al., 2010; Shirato, Kawase, & Matsuyama, 2013), and syncytia formation was compared

93

to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV spikes (which have previously been shown to poorly and efficiently result

94

in syncytia formation, respectively). As described before, SARS-CoV spike expression resulted in poor

95

syncytia formation while MERS-CoV spike produced much higher levels of syncytia (Figure 1B). SARS-

96

CoV-2 WT spike gave an intermediate level of syncytia formation that was ablated for the mutants

97

which were not cleaved by furin. The H5CS spike bearing the optimised furin CS produced a higher

98

level of syncytia formation than SARS-CoV-2 WT, similar to MERS-CoV spike.

99

To investigate the differences in spike cleavage efficiency in producer cells between the

100

mutants, we produced PV with each mutant spike protein (or SARS-CoV) in human embryonic kidney

101

293T (293T) cells. PV were concentrated and probed by western blot (Figure 1C, left panel). Equal

102

amounts of PV particles were loaded as indicated by p24 content. PV formed with SARS-CoV-2 WT

103

spike had two bands reactive with anti-spike S2 antibody, corresponding to cleaved and uncleaved

104

spike, with the stronger band corresponding to the cleaved S2 product. PV containing the H5CS spike

105

showed very little uncleaved spike while PV with SARS-CoV WT spike and SARS-CoV-2 monobasic and

106

deletion mutants showed near compete losses of cleaved spike. When PV were produced in parallel

107

in the presence of a furin inhibitor, full-length spike was somewhat restored for the WT and H5CS

108

spike (Figure 1C, right panel). We also took WT and ΔCS SARS-CoV-2 virus, concentrated virions by

109

centrifugation and probed by western blot for spike cleavage (Figure 1D). Like the PV, WT SARS-CoV-

110

2 harboured both uncleaved and cleaved S2 whereas the virions of the ΔCS mutant virus only had

111

uncleaved spike. Overall, these data confirm that the polybasic CS of SARS-CoV-2 is a bona fide furin

112

CS.

113

The polybasic cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein promotes entry into epithelial

114

cell lines and cultures but adversely affects entry into Vero and 293Ts cells.

115

To investigate whether the S1/S2 furin CS of SARS-CoV-2 plays a role in virus entry, we initially

116

performed competition assays by taking a mixed population of virus containing 70% ΔCS mutant and

117

30% WT SARS-CoV-2 (as determined by deep sequencing of the S1/S2 CS; Figure 2A) and inoculating

118

the virus mix onto Vero E6 cells, human intestinal Caco-2 cells or air-liquid interface human airway

119

epithelial cell cultures (HAEs) at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) to enable multicycle replication.

120

We deep sequenced the progeny virus at 72 hours post-inoculation from the Vero E6 or Caco-2

121

(human intestinal) cells and found that whereas the ΔCS mutant outcompeted the WT in Vero E6 cells,

122

WT became predominant in the Caco-2 cells. In primary HAE cultures, the WT virus also outcompeted

123

the ΔCS virus until the variant was almost undetectable after 72 hours. We also infected Calu-3 (human

124

lung) cells with either the clonal WT or ΔCS viruses at an MOI of 0.1 (Figure 2C). WT virus replicated

125

robustly and reached peak titres greater than 105 pfu after 48 hours. Conversely, ΔCS virus, appeared

126

unable to productively infect Calu-3 cells and no infectious titre was detected in supernatant at any

127

time point.

128

Next, we probed the ability of PV with different mutant spike proteins to enter several

129

different human cell lines: 293T cells expressing human ACE2, Caco-2 cells or Calu-3 cells (Figure 2D-

130

F). PV bearing the envelope of amphotropic murine leukaemia virus (MLV-A) or Indiana vesicular

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.30.318311; this version posted September 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this

131

stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) were used as positive controls for cell entry while PV produced

132

without any viral glycoproteins (bald) were used as negative controls throughout. As seen in the Vero

133

E6 cells (Figure 2A), a clear negative correlation was seen between efficiency of furin cleavage of the

134

spike and entry in the 293T-ACE2 cells (Figure 2D). PV with WT SARS-CoV-2 spike entered 293T-ACE2s

135

more poorly than SARS-CoV, while mutants without furin cleavage (monoCS, ΔCS, Δflank) entered cells

136

significantly more efficiently (over 3-fold compared to WT). Introduction of the optimal furin CS (H5CS)

137

resulted in significantly poorer entry than WT (~10-fold lower; P < 0.001). When Caco-2 and Calu-3

138

cells were tested for PV entry, however, the opposite trend was observed reflecting the efficiency of

139

virus replication in Caco-2, Calu-3 and primary HAE cells (Figure 2E,F). WT and H5CS spike PV entered

140

cells efficiently while the mutants unable to be cleaved by furin, including ΔCS, entered cells

141

significantly less efficiently (>2-fold lower in Caco-2 cells and ~5-fold lower in Calu-3 cells).

142

We next tested the PV which had been generated in the presence of a furin inhibitor for their

143

ability to enter 293T-ACE2 and Caco-2 cells (Figure 2G,H). In 293T-ACE2, entry of PV bearing WT SARS-

144

CoV-2 or H5CS spike was boosted 2- to 3-fold if furin was inhibited when the PV was produced (Figure

145

2G). Conversely, WT SARS-CoV-2 PVs entered Caco-2 cells more poorly (2-fold lower) after inhibition

146

of furin cleavage, while no effect was seen on the H5CS mutant, potentially due to the majority of

147

spike still remaining cleaved even after furin inhibition (Figure 1H). No significant differences in entry

148

were observed for the other mutants or SARS-CoV.

149

Overall, these results suggest that during replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero and 293T-ACE2

150

cells, there is a fitness cost in having a cleaved spike prior to entry, while in primary airway cells and

151

lung and intestinal cell lines, possessing a processed SARS-CoV-2 furin CS provides an advantage by

152

facilitating entry.

153

Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into 293T cells is dependent on cathepsins while entry into Caco-

154

2, Calu-3 and primary HAE cells is dependent on TMPRSS2

155

As well as processing at the S1/S2 CS, coronavirus spike protein requires cleavage at the S2’

156

site to enable the virus membrane to fuse with the membrane of the host cell. To investigate whether

157

the different cell entry phenotypes seen in 293T-ACE2/Vero vs Caco-2/Calu-3/HAE cells was due to

158

differences in the protease use in different cell types, we performed PV entry assays in the presence

159

of different protease inhibitors: camostat which inhibits serine proteases such as TMPRSS2, and E-

160

64d, which inhibits cathepsins. Both drugs have previously been shown to be inhibitory to SARS-CoV

161

and SARS-CoV-2 entry (Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, Schroeder, et al., 2020; X. Ou et al., 2020).

162

In 293T-ACE2 cells, camostat pre-treatment did not inhibit PV entry whereas E-64d strongly

163

inhibited entry of SARS-CoV spike PVs, as well as SARS-CoV-2 WT PVs and all CS mutants (Figure 3A).

164

In Caco-2 cells, a different pattern was seen: camostat had a significant impact on PVs bearing spike

165

proteins with furin CSs whereas E-64d had a significant impact on PV which were not cleaved by furin

166

(Figure 3B). In Calu-3 cells, camostat significantly inhibited entry of all coronavirus PVs while E-64d

167

also had a modest, but significant (P < 0.05), effect on the ΔCS mutant (Figure 3C). Control PV

168

expressing MLV-A or VSV-G, which are not reliant on cathepsins or serine proteases for entry

169

(Hoffmann, Kleine-Weber, Schroeder, et al., 2020), were not significantly affected by either drug in

170

any cell line.

171

To confirm that dependence of serine proteases for entry, as observed in Caco-2 and Calu-3

172

cells, was seen with whole SARS-CoV-2 virus in primary airway cells, we examined multicycle

173

replication of clonal WT and ΔCS viruses on HAE cells in the presence or absence of camostat (Figure

174

3D). Our previous results showed that the ∆CS virus was selected against on HAE cells and, indeed,

175

the ∆CS virus grew to significantly lower titres than WT. Addition of 50 µM camostat almost

176

completely abrogated virus replication of both ∆CS and WT virus (Figure 3D), showing that in HAEs,

177

efficient cleavage by serine proteases facilitates efficient entry.

178

To investigate whether differences in endogenous levels of different proteases could explain

179

the phenotypic differences seen in the different human cell lines, as well as HAEs, we quantified the

180

expression of several different proteases using qPCR (Figure 3E-H). All three human cell lines and the

181

primary HAE cultures expressed ACE2 and cathepsin L to varying degrees. However, 293T-ACE2 cells

182

lacked any detectable TMPRSS2 expression, likely explaining why camostat had little effect on PV entry

183

into these cells. Although not tested here, several previous studies have shown Vero E6 cells also

184

express no endogenous TMPRSS2 (Bertram et al., 2010; Shirato et al., 2013).

185

Expression of TMPRSS2 promotes entry of SARS-CoV-2 expressing a full polybasic

186

cleavage site.

187

To investigate whether expression of TMPRSS2 was responsible for the advantage seen by

188

viruses with furin cleavable spike proteins in Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells, we transiently co-expressed ACE2

189

with or without TMPRSS2 in 293T cells and compared the entry of furin cleaved and non-furin cleaved

190

PV (Figure 4A). We found that entry of all coronavirus PVs was promoted by the expression of

191

TMPRSS2, even though TMPRSS2 expression led to lower levels of cell associated ACE2 due to ACE2

192

being a substrate of TMPRSS2 (Supplementary Figure S1A) (Shulla et al., 2011). The TMPRSS2

193

enhancement of PV entry was particularly potent for the PVs harbouring furin CS containing spike

194

(>15-fold), compared to the non furin-cleaved mutants (<10-fold) indicating that expression of

195

TMPRSS2 favours the entry into cells of PVs with furin CSs.

196

The furin cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 allows escape from IFITM2/3 proteins in TMPRSS2

197

expressing cells

198

The enhanced replication shown by SARS-CoV-2 with furin pre-cleaved spike to utilise

199

TMPRSS2 to enter cells efficiently suggested this virus may prefer to enter cells via membranes near

200

the cell surface or in the early endosome rather than be trafficked into late endosomes where it could

201

be cleaved by host cathepsins. We hypothesised that the wild type virus may be avoiding host

202

restriction factors in the endosome, such as IFITM2/3 proteins, which have previously been shown to

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.30.318311; this version posted September 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this

203

be able to restrict SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 entry (Huang et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2020; Zheng et al.,

204

2020). The antifungal agent amphotericin B (amphoB) has been well described as inhibiting the

205

restriction imposed by IFITM proteins, particularly the endosomal/lysosomal localised IFITM2/3,

206

potentially modulating the host membrane fluidity required for efficient restriction (Lin et al., 2013;

207

Zhao et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2020). We could also show that 293T-ACE2, Caco-2, Calu-3 and HAEs all

208

constitutively expressed IFITM3, even in the absence of exogenous interferon (Figure 3E-H). We

209

treated cells with amphoB and investigated the effect on PV entry. In 293T-ACE2 cells, entry of all

210

coronavirus PV was improved by amphoB pre-treatment, with the largest effect exerted upon PVs

211

with polybasic CS containing spikes (Figure 4B). Conversely, in Caco-2 and Calu-3 cells, the opposite

212

effect was seen – entry of PVs with non-furin CS spikes was boosted, in some cases significantly by

213

amphoB treatment, whereas there was little or no effect on the entry of PVs with furin CS containing

214

spikes (Figure 4C,D).

215

Next, we took 293T cells and transiently co-transfected a combination of ACE2 and TMPRSS2

216

in the presence or absence of IFITM3. Entry of PVs with furin CS containing spikes were less inhibited

217

by IFITM3 than those with spikes that could not be furin cleaved (Figure 4E, Supplementary Figure

218

S1B).

219

Finally, we investigated the effect of amphoB treatment on SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary

220

airway cells. AmphoB had no effect on WT virus replication, but greatly increased the replication of

221

the ΔCS mutant (Figure 4F). This implies that IFITM proteins, such as IFITM3, are a major block for

222

entry of viruses without furin CSs in these cells.

223

The SARS-CoV-2 polybasic cleavage site promotes replication in the respiratory tract

224

and transmission in a ferret model

225

To investigate whether the furin CS plays a role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, we used

226

ferrets as an in vivo model. Ferrets are commonly used in transmission studies of respiratory

227

pathogens such as influenza and, more recently, SARS-CoV-2 (Belser et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2020;

228

Richard et al., 2020). Four ferrets per group were each infected intranasally with 105 pfu of clonally

229

purified stocks of the WT or ΔCS mutant SARS-CoV-2 viruses. After 24 hours, naïve contact ferrets

230

were placed into each cage. All ferrets were nasal washed daily for the following 2 weeks and virus

231

shedding in the nose was titrated by qRT-PCR and by TCID50 (Figure 5A,B, Supplementary Figure S2A,B).

232

All eight directly inoculated ferrets shed virus robustly for 9-12 days (Figure 5A). The WT infected

233

group shed more virus in the nose than ferrets infected with ΔCS virus, indicated by higher infectivity

234

and higher E gene copy numbers, the latter significant at days 2-4. In the WT group, 2/4 contact ferrets

235

became productively infected indicated by infectious virus, E gene loads in nasal wash, and

236

seroconversion, whereas no transmission from donor ferret infected with ΔCS mutant virus was

237

detected (Figure 5B, Supplementary Figures S2A-C). In nasal washes of the two remaining ferrets

238

exposed to donors infected with WT virus, low E gene copy numbers were detected but no infectious

239

virus was measured by TCID50, and these animals remained seronegative at 14 days post exposure,

240

implying these ferrets were genuinely not infected in contrast to all directly infected animals and the

241

two virus positive WT infected sentinels (Supplementary Figure S2C).

242

Next, a competition assay was performed whereby four ferrets were inoculated intra-nasally

243

with 105 pfu of the previously described mixture of WT and ΔCS virus at a 30:70 ratio, as determined

244

by deep sequencing. One day post-inoculation, naïve contact ferrets were cohoused with each directly

245

inoculated animal and all animals were nasal washed daily. All directly inoculated ferrets became

246

productively infected, shedding infectious virus and detectable E gene in nasal wash for between 9-

247

12 days (Figure 5C). Interestingly, which virus genotype became dominant in the nasal washes of the

248

directly infected ferrets appeared to vary stochastically; in two animals the WT virus became

249

predominant by day 2, and levels of infectious virus and E gene detected in their nasal wash was

250

highest. In the nasal wash of the other two directly inoculated animals, the ΔCS virus remained the

251

majority species or outcompeted the WT over the course of the experiment. Productive transmission

252

was only recorded in a single contact and interestingly, this animal was co-caged with one of the

253

animals that was shedding predominantly WT virus. The ΔCS genotype was detectable in this single

254

contact at low levels on day 3, 8 and 9, but at all times the WT genotype was clearly predominant.

255

Furthermore, this was the only contact ferret to seroconvert, confirming the other 3 contact ferrets

256

were not productively infected (Supplementary Figure S3D). No ferrets in either group showed

257

appreciable fever or weight loss (Supplementary Figures S3A-C, S2D,E). Together these results suggest

258

that the furin CS of SARS-CoV-2 is a determinant of transmission in the ferret model.

259

SARS-CoV-2 spike variants with deletions or mutations in the polybasic cleavage site are

260

detectable in human tissues.

261

Finally, we wanted to investigate whether spike deletion mutants could be found in human

262

clinical samples and, if so, whether they were more likely to be found in a particular organ. Initially we

263

downloaded 100,000 genome sequences from GISAID and found 2 sequences from nasal swabs with

264

CS deletions (Supplementary Table S1). Next, we sequenced the S1/S2 CS from 24 previously described

265

post-mortem samples taken from five different post-mortems and including tissues from the

266

respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, the brain, heart, bone marrow, kidney, tongue and spleen

267

(Hanley et al., 2020). Sequencing revealed very low levels of viral RNA bearing different S1/S2 CS

268

deletion (<1%) from heart and spleen tissue from separate patients (Supplementary Table S2). The

269

three separate deletions reported in Supplementary Table S1 have not previously been reported but

270

are similar to those seen upon passage in Vero E6 cells. OS5 deletes 4 amino acids after the CS similar

271

to a deletion reported in a recent preprint (Sasaki et al., 2020); OS19-1 overlaps with most of ∆Flank

272

and OS19-2 completely removes the S1/S2 site, similar to ∆CS. We have also observed identical

273

deletions to OS19-2 upon passaging the clonal WT virus in Vero E6 cells. These results are consistent

274

with the conclusion that S1/S2 cleavage site deletions can arise naturally in vivo, albeit at a very low

275

rate.

276

Discussion

277

An insertion of 4 amino acids in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein created a suboptimal furin

278

cleavage site (CS). Here, we propose a mechanism by which this conferred an advantage to the virus

279

in the human airway and enabled efficient human-to-human transmission. We show that pre-cleavage

280

of the spike during viral egress enhanced entry of progeny virions into TMPRSS2-expressing cells such

281

as those abundant in respiratory tissue. TMPRSS2 cleaves spike at S2’ and facilitates entry at the cell

282

surface (or possibly the early endosome) as opposed to entry through the endosome. This allows virus

283

to avoid the otherwise potent IFITM restriction factors that reside in the late endosome and lysosome

284

and inhibit viral membrane fusion in these compartments. Viruses that lack a polybasic S1/S2 CS

285

cannot be cleaved by furin in producer cells and are thus forced to enter the next cell they infect

286

through the endosome where the spike can be cleaved at S1/S2 and S2’ by cathepsins. However, pre-

287

cleaved spike is not always advantageous: in cell types lacking TMPRSS2 expression, such as Vero E6,

288

viruses without the furin CS gain an advantage, potentially because they are more stable, since spike

289

cleavage may result in premature loss of the S1 subunit altogether and abrogate receptor binding. Our

290

results show that, in contrast with WT SARS-CoV-2, a virus with a deleted furin CS did not replicate to

291

high titres in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets and did not transmit to cohoused sentinel animals,

292

in agreement with recent results from similar experiments with hamsters (Y. Zhu et al., 2020). It is not

293

yet clear whether transmission is blocked due to the lower titres released from the directly inoculated

294

donor ferrets, or to a lower ability to initiate infection in the TMPRSS2-rich cells of the nasal epithelium

295

or a combination of these. We have found that furin CS deletions arise naturally in various different

296

human organs during severe infection, but rarely and at low levels. Indeed, we note only 2 recorded

297

genomes on GISAID out of 100,690 (as of 16/9/20) with furin CS deletions (Supplemental Table S1).

298

Given the ease of loss of the furin CS in cell culture, the lack of these mutants in sequenced isolates is

299

further evidence that the furin CS is essential for sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in humans.

300

Presence of a furin CS at the S1/S2 junction is not uncommon in human coronaviruses; two of

301

the four seasonal coronaviruses that transmit efficiently in humans, hCoV-HKU1 and hCoV-OC43, both

302

contain furin CSs while MERS-CoV contains a suboptimal dibasic furin CS (Le Coupanec et al., 2015;

303

Millet & Whittaker, 2014). However, the other two human seasonal coronaviruses, hCoV-229E and

304

the ACE2 binding hCoV-NL63, do not contain furin CSs in their spike proteins seemingly without any

305

detriment to transmissibility. Thus, furin-mediated cleavage of spike is not an absolute requirement

306

for efficient human respiratory transmission. Furthermore, the original 2003 SARS-CoV lacked a furin

307

CS and was clearly transmitted between people, although this usually occurred during a symptomatic

308

phase rather than asymptomatically or pre-symptomatically, thus allowing the virus outbreak to be

309

controlled by public health measures (Liu, Gayle, Wilder-Smith, & Rocklov, 2020). Several recent

310

studies have investigated the pathogenicity of naturally occurring or engineered deletion mutants in

311

the hamster model, and shown that viruses lacking the furin CS are attenuated for replication and

312

pathogenicity (Johnson et al., 2020; Lau et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2020). We, like

313

others, did not find that SARS-CoV-2 induced significant clinical signs in ferrets, so were unable to

314

assess the effect of the CS mutation on viral pathogenesis here. Nonetheless, we did observe

315

transmission between ferrets suggesting clinical signs are not required for transmission. A further

316

single study also found a CS deletion mutant virus did not transmit between hamsters (Y. Zhu et al.,

317

2020). Two studies suggest that the furin cleavage peptide motifs at the S1/S2 CS enables WT SARS-

318

CoV-2 virus to utilise neuropilin as a cellular attachment/entry factor (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020;

319

Daly et al., 2020). However, since 293T cells express neuropilin and lentiviral pseudotypes (PV) lacking

320

the furin CS enter these cells more efficiently than PV containing it, this suggests that neuropilin is not

321

responsible for the entry differences between furin cleavage mutants.

322

IFITM proteins are well characterised restriction factors of many enveloped viruses. Human

323

IFITM3, for example, is a potent inhibitor of influenza infection and naturally occurring variants have

324

been associated with severe influenza infection (Everitt et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2011; Zhang et al.,

325

2013). IFITM proteins have also been shown to inhibit coronavirus entry (Huang et al., 2011; Wrensch,

bioRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.30.318311; this version posted September 30, 2020. The copyright holder for this

326

Winkler, & Pohlmann, 2014), although hCoV-OC43 and hCoV-HKU1 are unique in that IFITM proteins

327

appear to act as entry factors to these viruses (Zhao et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2018). There is growing

328

evidence that IFITM proteins inhibit SARS-CoV-2 syncytia formation or pseudoviral or viral entry

329

(Bozzo et al., 2020; Buchrieser et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2020), as we confirm here. This may partly explain

330

the vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 to IFN treatment (Mantlo, Bukreyeva, Maruyama, Paessler, & Huang,

331

2020). A recent preprint has suggested that under certain conditions IFITM proteins can have a modest

332

pro-viral effect on SARS-CoV-2 virus growth (Bozzo et al., 2020). This is not inconsistent with our data

333

which showed that amphotericin B mediated inhibition of IFITM proteins had no effect on, and if

334

anything, slightly inhibited, WT SARS-CoV-2 virus replication in primary human cells.

335

Our study confirms TMPRSS2 as a potential drug target. Whilst inhibition of TMPRSS2

336

protease activity would not prevent infection via the endosome, using this pathway is detrimental to

337

virus replication in airway cells. We have shown in this study that the protease inhibitor, camostat, is

338

highly efficient at blocking SARS-CoV-2 replication in human airway cells and we note that clinical trials

339

are ongoing [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04455815]. Our study also confirms the limitations of

340

relying on Vero E6 cells as a system for developing classes of drugs such as entry inhibitors as they do

341

not accurately reflect the preferred entry mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 into human airway cells

342

(Hoffmann, Mosbauer, et al., 2020; T. Ou et al., 2020). Indeed the data here explains why chloroquine

343

is ineffective in clinic against SARS-CoV-2 (Hoffmann, Mosbauer, et al., 2020), since during replication

344

in the human airway WT SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to enter cells without the need for endosomal

345

acidification. Monitoring wild coronaviruses will likely be important in predicting and preventing

346

future pandemics. We suggest that a furin CS in the SARS lineage is a cause for concern. The polybasic

347

insertion to the S1/S2 CS provides a significant fitness advantage in TMPRSS2 expressing cells and is

348

likely essential for efficient human transmission.

373

The mixed SARS-CoV-2 WT/deletion virus mix was produced as previously described (Davidson

374

et al., 2020). Briefly, the mix was generated by passaging the strain England/2/2020 (VE6-T), isolated

375

by Public Health England (PHE), in Vero E6 cells whereby the deletion spontaneously arose (Davidson

376

et al., 2020). The WT SARS-CoV-2 strain SARS-CoV-2 strain England/2/2020 (VE6-T) and the ΔCS

377

mutant present in the original mixed stock were purified by serially diluting the stock (10-fold

378

dilutions) in MEM supplemented with 2% FCS and adding the dilutions to either Vero E6 or Caco-2

379

cells in a 96 well plate. After 5 days incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the culture supernatants in wells

380

showing CPE at the highest dilution were again diluted and passaged on the same cells. After a further

381

5 days incubation, a 20 μl aliquot of culture supernatant from wells showing CPE at the highest dilution

382

were used for RNA extraction and RT-PCR using a primer set designed to discriminate the WT and ΔCS

383

mutant viruses. Culture supernatants containing either the WT or ΔCS mutant virus, with no sign of a

384

mixed virus population were used to produce large scale stocks in Vero E6 cells. The presence of the

385

expected virus in the stocks was verified by direct RNA sequencing using an Oxford Nanopore flow cell

386

as previously described (Davidson et al., 2020). Clonally pure viruses were then further amplified by

387

one additional passage in Vero E6/TMPRSS2 cells to make the working stocks of the viruses used

388

throughout this study.

389

For plaque assays Vero E6 cells were used at 70-80% confluence. Cells were washed with PBS

390

then serial dilutions of inoculum, diluted in serum-free DMEM, 1% NEAA, 1% P/S, were overlayed onto

391

cells for one hour at 37oC. Inoculum was then removed and replaced with SARS-CoV-2 overlay media

392

(1x minimal essential media [MEM], 0.2% w/v bovine serum albumin, 0.16% w/v NaHCO3, 10mM

393

Hepes, 2mM L-Glutamine, 1x P/S, 0.6% w/v agarose). Plates were incubated for 3 days at 37oC before

394

overlay was removed and cells were stained for 1 hour at RT in crystal violet solution.

395

To titrate virus by TCID50 Vero E6 cells were used at 70-80% confluence. Serial dilutions of

396

virus, diluted in serum-free DMEM, 1% NEAA, 1% P/S, were added to each well and cells were left for

397

5 days before they were fixed with 2x crystal violet solution and analysed. 4 replicates of each sample

Plasmids and cloning

401

Lentiviral packaging constructs pCSLW and pCAGGs-GAGPOL were made as previously

402

described (Long, Wright, Molesti, Temperton, & Barclay, 2015). The codon-optimised spike proteins

403

of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were a kind gift from Professor Robin Shattock, Imperial

404

College London (McKay et al., 2020). Mutant SARS-CoV-2 expression plasmids were generated by site-

405

directed mutagenesis. The lentiviral expression vector for human ACE2, MT126, was a kind gift from

406

Caroline Goujon, University of Montpellier. ACE was further cloned into pCAGGs with the addition of

407

a C-terminal FLAG-tag. TMPRSS2 expression plasmid was a kind gift from Roger Reeves (Addgene

408

plasmid #53887 ; http://n2t.net/addgene:53887 ; RRID:Addgene_53887,(Edie et al., 2018)).

Syncytia formation assay

410

Vero E6 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (6.5x103 cells per well) to reach 70-80% confluency

411

on the subsequent day. Transfection was performed using 100 ng of expression plasmid using 0.3 µl

412

of FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent (Promega E2311) in 20 µl of Opti-MEM medium (Life

413

Technologies). At 48 hr after drug treatment, plates were washed in 100 µL/well of 1xPBS and fixed in

414

40 µl 4% PFA for 10 min at RT. After fixation cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Tritonx100 for 10 min

423

Splitting coefficient was set in order to avoid splitting of overlapping nuclei (fused cells). All the cells

424

that had a nuclear area greater than 3 times the average area of a single nucleus were considered as

425

fused. Data were expressed as a percentage of fused cells by calculating the average number of fused

426

cells normalized on the total number of cells per well.

427

Lentiviral pseudotype assays

428

Lentiviral pseudotypes (PV) were generated as previously described (Long et al., 2015; Sumner

429

et al., 2020). Briefly, 10cm2 dishes of 293T cells were co-transfected with a mixture of 1 µg of the HIV

430

packaging plasmid pCAGGs-GAGPOL, 1.5 µg of the luciferase reporter construct, pCSLW and 1 µg of

431

each envelope protein in pcDNA3.1. PV containing supernatants were harvested at 48- and 72-hours

432

post-transfection, passed through a 0.45 µm filter, aliquoted and frozen at -80oC. When used, the pro-

433

protein convertase inhibitor Decanoyl-RVKR-CMK (Calbiochem) was applied to cells at a concentration

434

of 5 µM, 3 hours post-transfection. Concentrated PV were produced by ultracentrifugation at 100,000

435

x g for 2 hours over a 20% sucrose cushion.

436

Cells were transduced by PV for 48 hours before lysis with cell culture lysis buffer (Promega).

437

Luciferase luminescence was read on a FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMF Labtech) using the

438

Luciferase Assay System (Promega). The cathepsin inhibitor E-64d (Sigma-Aldrich), the serine protease

439

inhibitor camostat mesylate (Abcam), or the antifungal and IFITM3 inhibitor Amphotericin B (Sigma-

440

Aldrich) was pre-applied to cells for 1 hour at a concentration of 50 µM before addition of PV.

467

were analysed in Geneious (v11) and a pipeline in R. Forward and reverse reads were paired using

468

FLASh (https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/FLASH) before being mapped to a reference sequence. Raw

469

sequences were deposited at www.ebi.ac.uk/ena, project number PRJEB40394. The analysis pipeline

Human Clinical Samples

472

A total of 100,690 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were downloaded from GISAID on 16/9/2020 and

473

aligned to 234bp from the spike protein using Geneious. In frame deletions were identified in R and

474

analysed to ensure that samples had not been passaged prior to sequencing. Code for this analysis

Ferret transmission studies

477

Ferret transmission studies were performed in a containment level 3 laboratory, using a

478

bespoke isolator system (Bell Isolation Systems, U.K). Outbred female ferrets (16-20 weeks old),

479

weighing 750-1000 g were used.

480

Prior to the study, ferrets were confirmed to be seronegative against SARS-CoV-2. Four donor

481

ferrets were inoculated intranasally with 200 μl of 105 pfu of virus mix while lightly anaesthetised with

482

ketamine (22 mg/kg) and xylazine (0.9 mg/kg). To assess direct contact transmission one naïve direct

483

contact ferrets were introduced into each cage 1-day post initial inoculation.

484

All animals were nasal washed daily, while conscious, by instilling 2 mL of PBS into the nostrils,

485

the expectorate was collected into disposable 250 ml sample pots. Ferrets were weighed daily post-

486

infection, and body temperature was measured daily via subcutaneous IPTT-300 transponder (Plexx

487

B.V, Netherlands).

Virus Neutralisation assay

489

The ability of ferret sera to neutralise wild type SARS-CoV-2 virus was assessed by

490

neutralisation assay on Vero E6 cells. Heat-inactivated sera were serially diluted in assay diluent

491

consisting of DMEM (Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher

492

Scientific), 0.3% BSA fraction V (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Serum dilutions were incubated with 100

493

TCID50/well of virus in assay diluent for 1 h at RT and transferred to 96-well plates pre-seeded with

494

Vero E6 cells. Serum dilutions were performed in duplicate. Plates were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2

495

for 5 days before adding an equal volume of 2X crystal violet stain to wells for 1 h. Plates were washed,

496

wells were scored for cytopathic effect and a neutralisation titre calculated as the reciprocal of the

497

highest serum dilution at which full virus neutralisation occurred.
