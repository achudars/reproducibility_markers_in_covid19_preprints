Abstract
We have developed periscope, a tool for the detection and quantification of sub-genomic
RNA (sgRNA) in SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence data. The translation of the SARS-CoV-2
RNA genome for most open reading frames (ORFs) occurs via RNA intermediates termed
“sub-genomic RNAs”. sgRNAs are produced through discontinuous transcription which relies
on homology between transcription regulatory sequences (TRS-B) upstream of the ORF
start codons and that of the TRS-L which is located in the 5’ UTR. TRS-L is immediately
preceded by a leader sequence. This leader sequence is therefore found at the 5’ end of all
sgRNA. We applied periscope to 1,155 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Sheffield, UK and
validated our findings using orthogonal datasets and in vitro cell systems. Using a simple
local alignment to detect reads which contain the leader sequence we were able to identify
and quantify reads arising from canonical and non-canonical sgRNA. We were able to detect
all canonical sgRNAs at expected abundances, with the exception of ORF10. A number of
recurrent non-canonical sgRNAs are detected. We show that the results are reproducible
using technical replicates and determine the optimum number of reads for sgRNA analysis.
In VeroE6 ACE2+/- cell lines, periscope can detect the changes in the kinetics of sgRNA in
orthogonal sequencing datasets. Finally, variants found in genomic RNA are transmitted to
sgRNAs with high fidelity in most cases. This tool can be applied to all sequenced COVID-19
samples worldwide to provide comprehensive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sgRNA.

Introduction
Understanding variation within sub-genomic RNA (sgRNA) synthesis within the human host
may have important implications for the study of SARS-CoV-2 biology and evolution. Thanks
to advances in sequencing technology and collaborative science, over 100,000 SARS-CoV-2
genomes have been sequenced worldwide to date.
The genome of SARS-CoV-2 comprises a single positive-sense RNA molecule of
approximately 29kb in length. While the 1a and 1b polyproteins are translated directly from
this genomic RNA (gRNA), all other proteins are translated from sgRNA intermediates (Stern
and Kennedy 1980; Sola et al. 2015). sgRNAs are produced through discontinuous
transcription during negative strand synthesis followed by positive-strand synthesis to form
mRNA. The resulting sgRNAs contain a leader sequence derived from the 5’ untranslated
region of the genome and a transcription regulating sequence (TRS) 5’ of the ORF. The
template switch occurs during sgRNA synthesis due to a conserved core sequence within
the TRS 5’ of each ORF (TRS-B) and the TRS within the leader sequence (TRS-L)(Zúñiga et
al. 2004). The conserved core sequence leads to base pairing between the TRS-L and the
nascent RNA molecule transcribed from the TRS-B resulting in a long-range template switch
and incorporation of the 5’ leader sequence (Sola et al. 2015). SARS-CoV-2 produces at
least nine canonical sgRNAs containing ORFs for four structural proteins (S; spike, E;
envelope, M; membrane, N; nucleocapsid) and several accessory proteins (3a & b, 6, 7a &
b, 8 and 10)(F. Wu et al. 2020; Zhou et al. 2020; Davidson et al. 2020). In SARS-CoV ORFs
3b and 7b are considered nested ORFs and not thought to be translated from their own subgenomic RNA (Inberg and Linial 2004). Understanding variation within sgRNA synthesis
within the human host may have important implications for the study of SARS-CoV-2 biology
and evolution.

Beyond the regulation of transcription, sgRNA may also play a role in the evolution of
coronaviruses and the template switching required for sgRNA synthesis may explain the
high rate of recombination seen in coronaviruses (Simon-Loriere and Holmes 2011; H.-Y.
Wu and Brian 2010). While the majority of sgRNA relate to known ORFs, novel, noncanonical sgRNA are also produced (Nomburg, Meyerson, and DeCaprio 2020; Finkel et al.
2020; Kim et al. 2020), although the biological function of this is unclear. sgRNAs have also
been shown to modulate host cell translational processes (Patel et al. 2013).
The ARTIC Network (“Artic Network” 2020) protocol for the sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2
(Figure 1A) has been employed worldwide to characterise the genetic diversity of this novel
coronavirus. The COVID-19 Genomics Consortium (COG-UK)(“An Integrated National Scale
SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Surveillance Network” 2020) in the UK, alone, has produced 16826
ARTIC nanopore genome sequences (Correct 29th October 2020), while internationally
GISAID contains thousands more similar datasets (8775 with “nanopore” in the metadata
and 3660 list “artic”, 14th June 2020). This protocol involves the amplification of 98
overlapping regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in two pools of 49 amplicons to provide full
sequence coverage when sequenced with Oxford Nanopore sequencing devices. All known
SARS-CoV-2 ORF TRS sites are contained within one or more amplicons in this panel
(Figure 1A). Other methods of enrichment and enrichment-free sequencing of the SARSCoV-2 genome like bait based capture and subsequent short read Illumina sequencing or
metagenomics, respectively, are also popular and hold promise for the detection of sgRNA.

It has previously been shown that sgRNA transcript abundances can be quantified from full
RNASeq data by calculation of Reads Per Kilobase of transcript, per Million mapped reads
(RPKM) or by using so-called “chimeric” fragments containing the leader and TRS (Irigoyen
et al. 2016). From two independent repeats, the R2 between these two measurement
methods was 0.99. Studies of SARS-CoV-2 sgRNA have used methods which specifically

detect expressed RNA, such as direct RNA sequencing of cultured cells infected with SARSCoV-2 (Davidson et al. 2020; Taiaroa et al. 2020; Kim et al. 2020) or more traditional total
PolyA RNASeq (Finkel et al. 2020). We hypothesised that we could detect and quantify the
levels of sgRNA to both identify novel non-canonical sgRNA and provide an estimate of ORF
sgRNA expression in SARS-CoV-2 sequence data. Here we present a tool for these
purposes and its application to 1155 ARTIC Nanopore-generated SARS-CoV-2 sequences
derived from clinical samples in Sheffield, UK and validate our findings in data from
independent SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Glasgow, UK, in addition to Illumina data
generated with bait capture and metagenomic approaches.

Results
Evidence for Sub-Genomic RNA
We designed a tool, periscope (https://github.com/sheffield-bioinformatics-core/periscope),
to re-analyse raw data from SARS-CoV-2 isolates to identify sgRNA based on the detection
of the leader sequence at the 5’ end of reads as described previously (Leary et al. 2020).

ARTIC Network Nanopore Sequencing Data
The recommended bioinformatics standard operating procedure to process ARTIC network
sequencing data to produce a consensus sequence involves selecting reads between 400
and 700 base pairs, and the trimming of the primer and adapter sequence. In most cases
this removes reads which might provide evidence for sgRNA. Mapping raw data from this
protocol reveals the presence of reads at ORF TRS sites which are sometimes shorter
(Supplementary Figure S1 - sgRNA) than the full ARTIC Network amplicon and contain
leader sequence at their 5’ end. We believe these reads are the result, in the case of Pool 1,
priming from primer 1 of the pool, which is homologous to most of the leader sequence. We
also see, in both pools, uni-directional amplification from the 3’ primer, which results in a
truncated amplicon when the template is a sgRNA (Figure 1B). Interestingly, we also see
longer reads which are the result of priming from the 3’ end of the adjacent amplicon (Figure
1B).

To separate gRNA from sgRNA reads, we employ the following workflow using
snakemake(Köster and Rahmann 2012); Raw ARTIC Network Nanopore sequencing reads
that pass QC are collected and aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference, reads are filtered out
if they are unmapped or supplementary alignments. We do not perform any length filtering.
Each read is assigned an amplicon. We search the read for the presence of the leader

sequence (5’-AACCAACTTTCGATCTCTTGTAGATCTGTTCT-3’) using a local alignment. If we
find the leader with a strong match it is likely that that read is from amplification of sgRNA.
We assign reads to an ORF. Using all of this information we then classify each read into
genomic, canonical sgRNA or non-canonical sgRNA (Figure 1D) and produce summaries for
each amplicon and ORF including normalised pseudo-expression values.

Illumina Sequencing Data
Next we wanted to investigate whether we could employ a similar method to Illumina
sequencing data. Illumina sequencing data for SARS-CoV-2 has been generated using three
main approaches: amplicon based (ARTIC Network), bait capture based, or using
metagenomics on in vitro samples. Here we describe sgRNA detection in both Illumina bait
based capture and Illumina metagenomic data from in vitro exp. The reads from these
techniques tend to have differing amounts of leader at the 5’ end of the reads
(Supplementary Figure S2A). This is due to library preparation methods employed in these
workflows. We therefore implemented a modified method for detecting sgRNA to ensure that
we could capture as many reads originating from sgRNA as possible. In our Illumina
implementation (Supplementary Figure S2C&D) we extract the soft-clipped bases from the 5’
end of reads and use these in a local alignment to the leader sequence. In addition to
adjusting the leader detection method we also process mate pairs, ensuring both reads in
the pair are assigned the same status.

Detection of Sub-Genomic RNA
We were able to detect sgRNAs with a high leader alignment score from all canonical ORFs
in multiple samples (Figure 2, Supplementary Table S1). As shown in Figure 2A, sgRNA
from the N & M ORFs were the most abundant sgRNA (dependent on normalisation
method), with N being found in 97.3% of Sheffield samples, consistent with published reports
in vitro (Alexandersen, Chamings, and Bhatta 2020; Finkel et al. 2020; Kim et al. 2020). To
demonstrate that the levels of sgRNA detected in the Sheffield dataset were not site specific,
we applied periscope to an independent dataset of 55 ARTIC Network Nanopore sequenced
SARS-CoV-2 samples from Glasgow, UK (Figure 2A).

Like previously published reports (Taiaroa et al. 2020; Alexandersen, Chamings, and Bhatta
2020; Finkel et al. 2020; Kim et al. 2020), we were unable to find strong evidence of sgRNA
supporting the presence of ORF10 (Supplementary Table 2, Figure 2A) with only 0.95% of
samples containing high (HQ) or low quality (LQ) sgRNA calls at this ORF. We aligned the
12 reads from these samples to a reference composing of ORF10 and leader
(Supplementary Figure S3). On manual review of these results ten (4 HQ) of these reads are

falsely classified as sgRNA. Two reads remain, one read from each of samples SHEFC0840 and SHEF-C58A5. These reads could represent ORF10 sgRNA as they have an
almost complete match to the leader and the remainder of the reads is a strong match to
ORF10.

Normalisation of Sub-Genomic Read Abundance
Beyond defining the presence of reads which are a result of amplification of sgRNA, we
hypothesized that we could quantify the level of sgRNA present in a sample using either total
mapped reads or gRNA reads from the same amplicon as denominators for normalisation.
Normalisation of this kind would be analogous to traditional RNAseq analysis where reads
per million (RPM) are calculated to allow comparisons between datasets where the number
of reads affect the amount of each transcript detected. In the case of ARTIC Network
Nanopore sequencing data, which involves polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of small
(~400bp) overlapping regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, amplification efficiency of each
amplicon should also be taken into account. Because we have a median of 258,210 mapped
reads for samples from the Sheffield dataset (Supplementary Figure S4), we normalised
both gRNA or sgRNA per 100,000 mapped reads (gRNA reads per hundred thousand,
gRPHT, or sgRNA reads per hundred thousand, sgRPHT, respectively, Figures 2C and E).

In our second approach, because of differences in amplicon performance in the ARTIC PCR
protocol that leads to coverage differences in the final sequencing data (Figure 2B&C), we
determine the amplicon from which the sgRNA has originated, using methods from the
ARTIC Network Field Bioinformatics package(“Artic Network” 2020). We then normalise the
sgRNA per 1000 gRNA reads from the same amplicon. If a sgRNA has resulted from more
than one amplicon (Figure 1B) the resulting normalised counts from each amplicon are
summed giving us sgRNA reads per 1000 gRNA reads (sgRPTg) for every ORF (Figure 2A).
Periscope outputs the results from both methods of normalisation so that the user can

decide which is more appropriate in their case and determine whether the conclusions of
their analysis are consistent across both approaches.

For Illumina data we applied one further normalisation technique to allow the normalisation
of bait based capture and metagenomic data. Efficiency of capture varies between probes
and designs. For metagenomic data, natural fluctuations in coverage due to sequence
content can exist, therefore, to try and account for this we took the median coverage for the
region around each canonical ORF start site (+/- 20bp) as the denominator in the
normalisation of this data.

and 72 hours after infection, sequenced using either ONT ARTIC or Illumina Metagenomic
approaches. F. The sum of all normalised (to total mapped reads to allow direct comparison
across ONT ARTIC and illumina metagenomic methods) sgRNA in each technology scaled

Sub-genomic RNA Detection in vitro
The kinetics of sgRNA expression during the course of a SARS-CoV-2 infection is still not
well understood. We applied periscope to data generated from an infection time course
(Figure 2F&G). We used both Illumina metagenomic and Nanopore ARTIC sequencing data
from an in vitro model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Wildtype (WT) VeroE6, VeroE6 expressing
ACE2 and VeroE6 expressing both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were infected with three different
SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates; PHE2 (wild type; WT), GLA1 (D614G) and GLA2 (N439K &
D614G) (Supplementary Table S9) and RNA collected for sequencing at 24, 48 and 72
hours. We normalised both datasets to the total mapped reads (per 100,000) to allow direct
comparison. Importantly the scaled normalised total sgRNA level detected using periscope
on both sequencing technologies is strikingly similar (Figure 2F), indicating the pattern of

expression is maintained between technologies. ORF N remains one of the highest
expressed ORFs in both datasets (Figure 2G). The addition of ACE2 and a combination of
ACE2 and TMPRSS2 results in a clear difference in the kinetics of all sgRNA over WT. This
data suggests that the peak of sgRNA expression is expedited by the addition of ACE2 and
TMRPSS2.

Technical Replicates & Batch Effects
To assess the reproducibility of sgRNA analysis using ARTIC Network Nanopore
sequencing data and periscope, we analysed two samples that were subject to four technical
replicates each; cDNA was independently prepared from the same swab extracted RNA, and
subject to independent amplification using the recommended ARTIC Network PCR and
sequenced (Figures 3A & 3B). The pearson correlation coefficient (R) is >=0.88 for all
normalised sgRNA abundances between replicates from the same sample.

Next, we treated our sgRNA abundance values like an RNASeq dataset and asked whether
other factors could be influencing expression. To do this we used an unsupervised principal
component analysis (PCA; Figure 3C-F) and coloured samples by the different categorical
variables that could affect expression (batch effects), like sequencing run, the ARTIC primer
version, the number of mapped reads and ORF E gene cycle threshold (e.g. CT, Diagnostic
test, normalised to RNAse P CT value, see materials and methods) as this is an indicator of
the amount of virus present in an isolate and a proxy for quality (Figure 3F). There are no
significant clusters between any of the above variables and the expression values in the
PCA analysis.

reads from 23 high coverage (>1million mapped reads) samples. The number of reads
provided as input to periscope was downsampled with seqtk(Li 2012) to 5,10,50,100,200,
and 500 thousand reads.

Lower Limit of Detection
The number of reads generated from any sequencing experiment is likely to vary between
samples and between runs. The median mapped read count in the Sheffield dataset is
258,210, but varies between 9,105 and 3,260,686 (Supplementary Figure S4). In our
experience we generally see much lower total amounts of sgRNA compared to their genomic
counterparts, therefore, its detection is likely to suffer when a sample has lower amounts of
reads (Supplementary Figure S5). To determine the effect of lower coverage on the
detection of sgRNA, we downsampled 23 samples which had > 1million mapped reads to
lower read counts with seqtk(Li 2012). We chose high (500k reads), medium (200k and
100k), and low read counts (50k,10k and 5k) and ran periscope on this downsampled data
(Supplementary File S3). In the absence of a ground truth, we performed pairwise
correlation on the abundance of sgRNA between downsampled datasets (Figure 3G). If
coverage did not affect the abundance estimates, then all coverage levels would show a
high correlation coefficient (pearson) when compared to each other (R>0.7, adjusted
p<0.01). As expected, lower counts of 5,000 and 10,000 reads do not correlate with those
generated from 100,000, 200,000 and 500,000 reads (R2 < 0.7). Samples with 50,000 reads

seem to perform well when compared to 100,000, 200,000 and 500,000 reads with an R2 of
0.94, 0.89, and 0.89 respectively.

Non-Canonical Sub-Genomic RNA
In addition to estimating sgRNA for known ORFs, we can use periscope to detect novel,
non-canonical sgRNA (Figure 4). We previously applied periscope to detect one such novel
sgRNA (N*) which is a result of the creation of a new TRS site by a triplet variation at
position 28881 to 28883 which results in production of a truncated N ORF (Leary et al.
2020). To classify sgRNA as non-canonical, supporting reads must fulfil two criteria; First,
the start position does not fall in a known TRS-B region (+/- 20bp from the leader junction),
and second, in ONT data the start position must not fall within +/-5bp from a primer
sequence. We chose to implement the second criteria because we noticed a pattern of novel
sgRNAs being detected at amplicon edges due to erroneous leader matches to the primer
sites.

We found evidence of non-canonical sgRNAs supported by two or more reads in 913
samples (Supplementary Figure S6). Unsurprisingly a large number of these recurrent noncanonical sgRNAs cluster around known TRS-B sites (Figure 4A). Interestingly though, we
see enrichment of non-canonical sgRNAs at other sites throughout the genome (Figure 4A
and Supplementary Figure S6).

In particular, SHEF-C0118 contains 177 reads (HQ & LQ) which support a non-canonical
sgRNA at position 25,744 between ORFs 3a and E (Figure 4B&C). The number of reads for
this non-canonical sgRNA at 25,744 is high compared to canonical sgRNA from the same
sample(Figure 4C, Supplementary Tables S3 & S4). 26 samples contain 1 read supporting
this non-canonical sgRNA with 4 samples with > 1 read. In another example, there are 377
samples that have evidence of >=1 read for a non-canonical sgRNA at position 10,639 (HQ

from 10,639). In this case, there is a TRS-like sequence close to the leader in this noncanonical sgRNA; ACGAAC -> ACGGAC. Two samples have significant support with 103 HQ
reads each (SHEF-CE04A, SHEF-CA0D5). It is possible that this represents an independent
ORF1b sgRNA. Furthermore, there are 226 samples that have evidence for a non-canonical
sgRNA at position 5,785 (>= 1 read; Supplementary Figure S7C&D; 62 with >=2 reads, +/-5
from 5,785), where there is no core TRS sequence present and there does not appear to be
a productive start codon.

Non-Canonical Sub-Genomic RNAs Across Centres & Technologies
To demonstrate the detection of non-canonical sgRNA was not a phenomenon of the
Sheffield dataset and ARTIC Nanopore method alone, we repeated the above analysis on
both Nanopore and Illumina data from Glasgow, UK (Figure 4A&D, Supplementary Figure
S8E).

The non-canonical sgRNA at 5,785 is found in 15/55 samples from this dataset and 7 of
those have multiple read support (Supplementary Table S6). This sgNA is also found with 3
reads in the Illumina sample CVR201. The non-canonical sgRNA found at 10,639 is found in
13/55 samples and 5 of those have multiple read support (Supplementary Table S7). 10,639
is also found in Illumina sample CV196 with 1 read 1 supporting. 25,744 is supported by 1
HQ sgRNA read in 1 sample (CVR2185) from the Glasgow ONT dataset.

To determine if there were any differences in non-canonical sgRNA over time, we applied
the same analysis to the in vitro system described earlier (Figure 4E & Supplementary
Figure S9). Normalised and scaled non-canonical (solid lines) shows that non-canonical
sgRNA has comparable kinetics to canonical sgRNA (dashed lines) which appear to be
dependent on the virus, cell line and time since infection. This dataset demonstrates that
although proportions of non-canonical sgRNA are similar (Supplementary Figure S5),
Illumina metagenomic data appears to be more sensitive (Supplementary Figure S5, S9,
S10) with a greater number of non-canonical sgRNAs detected.

Variants in Sub-Genomic RNA
An advantage of having reads from both gRNA and sgRNA is the ability to examine how
genomic variants are represented in sgRNAs. For variants found in our isolates by the
ARTIC Network nanopolish (Simpson 2018) pipeline we interrogated the bases called
(pysam (Gilman et al. 2019) pileup) at the variant position in gRNA and sgRNA to determine
if there were detectable differences (this tool is integrated into periscope). As we can only
discern gRNA and sgRNA from a small subset of amplicons, the chance that a variant falls
within these amplicons is low, but where the two do coincide, variants called in gRNA were
supported in reads from sgRNA.

In a small subset of samples we have identified variants in the TRS sequence of some
ORFs. Notably 6 samples have a variant at 27,046C>T (ACGAAC to ACGAAT)in the TRS of
ORF6, this variant is present in both the gRNA and sgRNA reads. 4 of these samples have
low expression of ORF6 compared to the rest of the cohort (Figure 5E), although numbers
are too low to compute statistical significance.

In addition, we have one sample with a variant in the N ORF TRS (SHEF-C0F96,
28256C>T. CTAAACGAAC to TTAAACGAAC) which is found only in gRNA but not sgRNA

reads. Interestingly, this sample has low expression of most ORFs (ORF N shown in Figure
5C) and has 233,127 reads which is around the median of the cohort. However, this
mutation falls outside the core TRS and read counts for sgRNA are low so this result should
be treated with caution. It is possible that this represents a sequencing error in the gRNA
which is not found in the sgRNA due to the context around that position changing as a result
of the inclusion of the leader sequence.

Discussion
We have developed periscope, a tool that can be used on nearly all publically available
SARS-CoV-2 sequence datasets worldwide to detect and quantify sgRNA. Here we applied
periscope to 1,155 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Sheffield, UK and 3 datasets from
Glasgow; 55 ARTIC network Nanopore sequences, 5 bait captured Illumina sequenced
samples and Illumina metagenomic data from an in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection model. The
development of periscope was initially motivated to aid in the the detection of a novel, noncanonical, sgRNA generated (N*) from a de-novo TRS site as a result of the triplet mutation
28,881G>A, 28,882G>A, and 28,883G>C found in a large number of worldwide SARS-CoV2 isolates (Leary et al. 2020). By searching for reads containing the SARS-CoV-2 leader
sequence, incorporated into all sgRNA at their 3’ ends by the SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent
RNA polymerase, we were able to detect sgRNA representing all annotated canonical open
reading frames of SARS-CoV-2. ORF10 sgRNA, however, was supported by only two reads
in all 1,155 samples in the Sheffield dataset (Supplementary Table S1). Using the in vitro
SARS-CoV-2 infection system Illumina dataset we identified a further eight reads in total
supporting an ORF10 sgRNA. Seven of these reads were present at 72 hours after infection,
the remaining read was found at 48 hours. The inability to find significant support for ORF10
mirrors previous findings (Alexandersen, Chamings, and Bhatta 2020; Finkel et al. 2020;
Davidson et al. 2020; Kim et al. 2020) and is perhaps unsurprising if ORF10 is indeed nonessential (Pancer et al. 2020). The abundance of other sgRNAs is in line with previously
published reports of protein levels in SARS-CoV-2, with M and N showing the highest
expression levels after normalisation (Bouhaddou et al. 2020; Finkel et al. 2020). In the
Sheffield dataset, the median proportion of total sgRNA is 1.2% (Supplementary Figure S4),
which is in broad agreement with published reports, based on ORF E, that sgRNA
represented 0.4% of total viral RNA (Wölfel et al. 2020). These findings were mirrored in an
equivalent dataset of 55 ONT ARTIC samples from Glasgow. We were able to show that

sgRNA analysis using periscope is reproducible, with strong correlations between sgRNA
abundance levels between technical replicates.

It has been suggested that sgRNA abundance estimates from amplicon based sequencing
data are largely a function of the quality of the RNA in the initial sample, defined in one study
by average read length (Alexandersen, Chamings, and Bhatta 2020). The advantage of the
ARTIC Network protocol over the AmpliSeq IonTorrent protocol used by the aforementioned
study is that the ARTIC Network protocol has a short, consistent amplicon length (mean is
389 and standard deviation is 11.2, Supplementary Figure S1 - gRNA). The assay is
designed inherently, to deal with samples with degraded RNA. Since sgRNA reads are a
product of these amplicons we do not believe degradation plays a significant role in the
determination of abundance levels in our dataset. Furthermore, using E gene CT value as a
surrogate for viral load, we find only a weak correlation with the total amount of sgRNA
detected (Spearman Rank Correlation, rho=0.268, Supplementary Figure S13A) and this
was mainly driven by outliers. Furthermore, sequence coverage across the genome (which
is affected by low viral load and poor quality RNA) is also not correlated with sgRNA amount
(Spearman Rank Correlation, rho=-0.01188594, Supplementary Figure S13B). Finally on
comparison with amplification free approaches like metagenomics we see a strikingly similar
pattern of sgRNA expression.

To demonstrate the utility of periscope for the investigation of important biological questions,
we applied it to sequencing data from an in vitro infection time course using VeroE6 cells
which were either wildtype, over-expressing ACE2 or over-expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2
(Hoffmann et al. 2020). These cells were challenged with three different viral isolates (GLA1,
GLA2, and PHE2) and total RNA extracted for sequencing by Illumina metagenomics and
ONT ARTIC at 24, 48 and 72hrs post infection. The total sgRNA abundance measured using
periscope on these orthogonal methods is strikingly similar and reveals an interesting pattern
of sgRNA expression. ACE2 & TMPRSS2 co-expressing cells have the most obviously

altered sgRNA kinetics, with the peak level of sgRNA occuring at 48hrs followed by a
reduction at 72hrs, which is in contrast with wildtype cells where sgRNA is still accumulating
after 48hrs. This may indicate an expedited course of active replication allowed by greater
cellular permissibility with ACE2 & TMPRSS2, followed by attenuated replication in a closed
in vitro model. Of note, a greater quantity of reads from the Illumina metagenomic data are
classified as sgRNA when compared to ONT ARTIC data (Supplementary Figure S4), and
there are some differences between the quantities of each ORF when considered
individually.

Non-canonical sgRNAs are readily detected by periscope and we present examples where
periscope was able to detect high abundances of specific non-canonical sgRNAs in a
number of isolates which could indicate some functional significance. It has previously been
observed that non-canonical sgRNAs are not formed due to a TRS-like homology (Nomburg,
Meyerson, and DeCaprio 2020). The non-canonical sgRNA at position 25,744 in SHEFC0118 is particularly interesting due to its high relative abundance compared to the
canonical sgRNAs in the same sample. There does not appear to be a canonical TRS
sequence in close proximity to the leader junction, but there exists a motif which has two
mismatches to the canonical TRS; AAGAAT. An ATG downstream of the leader in these
reads would result in an N-terminal truncated 3a protein. Interestingly, two forms of 3a
protein in SARS-CoV have been noted in the literature (Huang et al. 2006). Alternatively,
SARS-CoV contains a nested ORF within the 3a sgRNA, 3b (Supplementary Figure S11),
but the homolog of this protein is truncated early in SARS-CoV-2, however, others note that
a protein from this truncated 3b, of only 22 amino acids in length, could have an immune
regulatory function (Konno et al. 2020). This non-canonical sgRNA could indicate production
of this novel 3b protein in SARS-CoV-2 independent from the 3a sgRNA, a phenomenon that
has been shown to occur in SARS-CoV (Hussain et al. 2005). We cannot explain why, in this
sample, this non-canonical sgRNA is present in such high abundance. There are no
genomic variants that contribute to a TRS sequence, for example. We also find evidence of

highly recurrent non-canonical sgRNAs which have weaker evidence like those at 10,639,
which could represent an independent sgRNA for ORF 1b. Others, like those at 5,785 have
no apparent related ORF.

Some studies have detected the presence of an sgRNA for ORF7b (Finkel et al. 2020; Kim
et al. 2020), we also explored this possibility (Supplementary Figure S11 C,D&E). We are
able to detect non-canonical sub-genomic RNAs just 3’ of the predicted start codon of
ORF7b (27,760 and 27,761) and at least ten bases downstream of a predicted TRS-B site
(Yang et al. 2020). These sgRNAs have string support in both the Sheffield (Supplementary
Figure S11D), 668/1155 samples (>=1 high quality sgRNA, median of 2 reads per sample,
and a maximum of 133), and Glasgow datasets, 44/55 samples (>=1 high quality sgRNA,
median of 1.5 reads per sample, and a maximum of 12). Raw reads from SHEF-BFF12
show that the leader body junction in these sgRNAs does indeed exclude the start codon
and in fact includes four additional bases not present in the genome (Supplementary Figure
S11E). It is possible that this sgRNA encodes a protein from another ATG site downstream
of the leader-body junction.

We were able to detect a number of these recurrent non-canonical sgRNAs in the data from
Glasgow, demonstrating that these non-canonical sgRNAs are unlikely to be sequencing
artefacts and may represent favoured sites for non-canonical sgRNA generation during
SARS-CoV-2 replication for as yet unexplained reasons. We speculate that the diversity of
non-canonical sgRNA seen in our dataset, which is most comparable to total RNASeq
(Wyler et al. 2020), than direct RNAseq is a function of a) the number of samples analysed,
and b) the varied and unknown length of the infection at the time of sampling. These findings
illustrate that, although much is not known about the expression of non-canonical sgRNA,
periscope could help define and quantify these non-canonical transcripts in order to explore
their relevance in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.

We were able to integrate the sgRNAs for variants which were called in gRNA. As expected
in most cases, sgRNAs contain the same variants present in the gRNA. We found one case
where a variant found in gRNA for ORF N was not present in the ORF N sgRNA. It is
possible that this is due to sequencing errors, because the surrounding bases for the variant
in gRNA vs sgRNA differ, therefore, base calling could be affected by this change in context.

The COVID-19 Genomics Consortium (COG-UK)(“An Integrated National Scale SARS-CoV2 Genomic Surveillance Network” 2020) in the UK, alone, has 16,826 ARTIC Nanopore and
69,969 Illumina sequences (Correct 29th October 2020) while internationally GISAID
contains thousands more similar datasets (8,775 with “nanopore” in the metadata and 3,660
list “ARTIC” as of 14th June 2020). The application of periscope could therefore provide
significant insights into the sgRNA architecture of SARS-CoV-2 at an unprecedented scale.
Furthermore, periscope can be provided new primer/amplicon locations for PCR based
genomic analysis protocols and we have shown that it can be applied to metagenomic
sequencing methods without prior species-specific genome amplification. Periscope could
also be applied to sequencing data from other viruses where discontinuous transcription is
the method of gene expression.

Periscope offers an opportunity to further understand the regulation of the SARS-CoV-2
genome by identifying and quantifying sgRNA. Applying it to the vast amount of SARS-CoV2 sequencing datasets that have been generated world wide during this unprecedented
public health crisis could uncover critical insights into the role of sgRNA in SARS-CoV-2
pathogenesis.

Methods
Sheffield SARS-CoV-2 Sample Collection and Processing
1155 samples from 1155 SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals were obtained from either throat
or combined nose/throat swabs. Nucleic acids were extracted from 200µl of each sample
using MagnaPure96 extraction platform (Roche Diagnostics Ltd, Burgess Hill, UK). SARSCoV-2 RNA was detected using primers and probes targeting the E gene and the RdRp
genes of SARS-CoV-2 and the human gene RNAseP, to allow normalisation, for routine
clinical diagnostic purposes, with thermocycling and fluorescence detection on ABI Thermal
Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, United States) using previously described primer
and probe sets (Corman et al. 2020).

Sheffield SARS-CoV-2 Isolate Amplification and Sequencing
Nucleic acids from positive cases underwent long-read whole genome sequencing (Oxford
Nanopore Technologies (ONT), Oxford, UK) using the ARTIC Network protocol (accessed
the 19th of April, https://artic.network/ncov-2019, https://www.protocols.io/view/ncov-2019sequencing-protocol-bbmuik6w). In most cases 23 isolates and one negative control were
barcoded per 9.4.1D nanopore flow cell. Following basecalling, data were demultiplexed
using ONT Guppy (--require-both-ends). Reads were filtered based on quality and length
(400 to 700bp), then mapped to the Wuhan reference genome (MN908947.3) and primer
sites trimmed. Reads were then downsampled to 200x coverage in each direction. Variants
were called using nanopolish (Simpson 2018).

In Vitro SARS-CoV-2 Infection Model
Two derivatives and an unaltered lineage of the VeroE6 African green monkey kidney cell
line were used in this study. One VeroE6 cell line was manipulated to overexpress the
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (Ace2) receptor. In addition to Ace2 overexpression, a
third line was also induced to overexpress the serine protease Transmembrane protease,
serine 2 (TMPRSS2). These cell lines are referred to as VeroE6, VeroE6-ACE2 and VeroE6ACE2-TMPRSS2, respectively. Methods for the production and the validation of these cell
lines are fully described in Rhind et al 2020 (accepted PLOS Biology). SARS-CoV-2 infection
of these three cell lines were set up with three viral isolates (PHE2, GLA1 and GLA2 Supplementary Table S9) and supernatant harvested at 24, 48 and 72 hours for viral RNA
extraction and sequencing.

Illumina Metagenomic Sequencing
This protocol was applied to virus isolates propagated in vitro. Extracted nucleic acid was
incubated with DNAseI (Thermo Fisher, Part Number AM2222) for 5 minutes at 37oC. After
DNAse treatment, the samples were purified using Agencourt RNA Clean AMPure XP Beads
(Beckman Coulter, A63987), following the manufacturer’s guidelines, and quantified using
the Qubit dsDNA HS Kit (Thermo Scientific, Part Number Q32854). cDNA was synthesised
using SuperScript III (Thermo Scientific, Part Number 18080044) and NEBNext Ultra II NonDirectional RNA Second Strand Synthesis Module (New England Biolabs, Part Number
E6111L ), as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.
Samples were further processed utilising the Kapa LTP Library Preparation Kit for Illumina
Platforms (Kapa Biosystems, Part Number KK8232). Briefly, the cDNA was end repaired and
the protocol followed through to adapter ligation. At this stage the samples were uniquely
indexed using the NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina 96 Unique Dual Index Primer Pairs
(New England Biolabs, Part Number E6442S), with 15 cycles of PCR performed.

All amplified libraries were quantified by Qubit dsDNA HS Kit and run on the Agilent 4200
Tapestation System (Agilent, Part Number G2991AA) using the High Sensitivity D5000
Screentape (Agilent, Part Number 5067-5592) and High Sensitivity D5000 Reagents
(Agilent, Part Number 5067-5593). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550
(Illumina, Part Number SY-415-1002).

Sub-Genomic RNA Detection
Periscope consists of a Python based snakemake(Köster and Rahmann 2012) workflow
which runs a python package that processes and classifies reads based on their
configuration (Figure 1C).

Pre-Processing
Nanopore
Pass reads for single isolates are concatenated and aligned to MN908947.3 with minimap2
(v2.17) (Li 2018) (-ax map-ont -k 15). It should be noted that adapters or primers are not
trimmed. Bam files are sorted and indexed with samtools(Li et al. 2009).

Illumina
Paired end reads, ideally prior to trimming, are aligned to MN908974.3 with bwa mem
(v0.7.17) (Li and Durbin 2009) with the “Y” flag set to use soft clipping for supplementary
alignments. Bam files are sorted and indexed with samtools.

Periscope - Leader Identification & Read Classification
Nanopore
Reads from the minimap2 aligned bam file are then processed with pysam(Gilman et al.
2019). If a read is unmapped or represents a supplementary alignment then it is discarded.
Each read is then assigned an amplicon using the “find_primer” method of the ARTIC field

bioinformatics package. We search for the leader sequence (5’AACCAACTTTCGATCTCTTGTAGATCTGTTCT-3’) with biopython (Cock et al. 2009) local
pairwise alignment (localms) with the following settings, match +2, mismatch -2, gap -10 and
extension -0.1 with score_only set to true to speed up computation. The read is then
assigned an ORF using a pybedtools(Dale, Pedersen, and Quinlan 2011) and a bed file
consisting of all known ORFs +/-10 of the predicted leader/genome transition.

We classify reads as a “High Quality” (HQ) sgRNA (Figure 1D) if the alignment score is > 50
and the read is at a known ORF. If the read starts at a primer site then it is classified as
gRNA, if not, then it is classified as a “High Quality” non-canonical sgRNA supporting read. If
the alignment score is > 30 but <= 50 and the read is at a known ORF then it is classified as
a “Low Quality” (LQ) sgRNA. If the read is within a primer site, it is labelled as a gRNA, if not,
then it is a “Low Quality” sgRNA. Finally, any reads with a score of <= 30 and are at a known
ORF are then classified as a “Low Low Quality” sgRNA, otherwise, they are labelled as
gRNA. The following tags are added to the reads for manual review of the periscope calls;
XS: Alignment score, XA: Amplicon, AC: Read class, and XO: The read ORF. Reads are
binned into qualitative categories (HQ, LQ, LLQ etc) because we noticed that some sgRNAs
were not classified as such due to a lower match to the leader. After manual review, they are
deemed bona fide sgRNA. This quality rating negates the need to alter alignment score cutoffs continually to find the best balance between sensitivity and specificity. Restricting to HQ
data means that sensitivity is reduced but specificity is increased, including LQ calls will
decrease specificity but increase sensitivity.

Illumina
Reads from the bwa mem aligned bam file are processed with pysam. If a read is unmapped
or represents a supplementary alignment then it is discarded.

The presence of soft clipping at the 5’ end of the reads is an indicator that that read could
contain the leader sequence so we extract all of the soft clipped bases from the 5’ end,
additionally including three further bases to account for homology between leader and
genome at the N ORF (these bases would therefore not be soft clipped at this ORF). If there
are less than six extracted bases in total we do not process that read further as this is not
enough to determine a robust match to the leader sequence. With a match score of 2 and a
mismatch score of -2 (Gap opening penalty; -20, Extension, -0.1) soft clipped bases are
aligned to the leader sequence with localms. Soft clipped bases that include the full >=33 bp
of the leader would give an alignment score of 66. Allowing for two mismatches this gives a
“perfect” score of 60. If the number of soft clipped bases is less then we adjust the “perfect”
score in the following way:







2

 

2

This allows for one mismatch. The position of the alignment is then checked, for these bases
to be classed as the leader, the alignment of the soft clipped bases must be at the 3’ end. If
this is true and: 

0then the read is

classified as sgRNA.

Periscope - Sub-genomic RNA Normalisation
Amplicon Data
Once reads have been classified, the counts are summarised and normalised. Two
normalisation schemes are employed:
1. Normalisation to Total Mapped Reads

Total mapped reads per sample are calculated using pysam idxstats and used to
normalise both genomic, sgRNA and non-canonical sgRNA reads. Reads per
hundred thousand total mapped reads are calculated per quality group.

2. Normalisation to Genomic Reads from the Corresponding Amplicon
Counts of sgRNA, non-canonical sgRNA, and gRNA are recorded on a per amplicon
basis and normalisation occurs within the same amplicon per 1000 gRNA reads. If
multiple amplicons contribute to the count of sgRNA or non-canonical sgRNA then
the normalised values are summed.

Periscope outputs several useful files which are described in more detail in the
Supplementary Material, briefly these are; periscope’s processed bam file with associated
tags, a per amplicons counts file, and a summarised counts file for both canonical and noncanonical ORFs.

Bait Based Capture & Metagenomic Data
Again two schemes are employed, as above, to the total amount of mapped reads and
additionally:
3. Normalisation to Local Coverage
For both canonical and non-canonical sgRNA normalisation we calculate the median
coverage around either; a) for canonical ORFs the TRS site +/- 20bp or b) the
leader/genome junction +/- 20bp and normalise the total sgRNA per 1000 reads of
coverage.

Sub-Genomic Variant Analysis
A python script is provided “variant_expression.py” that takes the periscope bam file and a
VCF file of variants (usually from the ARTIC analysis pipeline). For each position in the VCF
(pyvcf(Casbon 2012)) file, it extracts the counts of each base in each class of read (i.e.
genomic, sgRNA and non-canonical sgRNA) and outputs these counts as a table. This tool
also provides a useful plot (Supplementary Figure S5) of the base counts at each position for
each class.

Analysis and Figure Generation
Further analysis was completed in R 3.5.2(Schulte et al. 2012) using Rstudio 1.1.442(Racine
2012), in general data was processed using dplyr (v0.8.3), figures were generated using
ggplot2 (v3.3.1), both part of the tidyverse(Wickham et al. 2019) family of packages (v1.2.1).
Plots themed with the ftplottools package (v0.1.5). GGally (v2.0.0) ggpairs was used for the
matrix plots for downsampling and repeats. Where multiple hypothesis tests were carried
out, multiple testing correction was carried out using Bonferroni. Reads were visualised in
IGV(Robinson et al. 2011) and annotated with Adobe Illustrator. Code for figure generation
can be found attached as a supplementary file and in the github repository:
https://github.com/sheffield-bioinformatics-core/periscope-publication.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA was carried out to determine if any of the experimental variables were responsible for
the differences in expression values between samples. Reads from ORF1a and ORF10
amplicons were removed from the analysis and expression values were normalised within
each ORF:

and then row means subtracted. The “PCA” function of the R package FactoMineR(Pagès
2014), (v1.41) was then used to carry out the PCA without further scaling and all other
settings as default. The resulting PCA was plotted using the “fviz_pca_ind” function. Plots
were coloured according to the variable in question.

Data Cleaning
Data was uploaded to ENA after removing human reads with dehumaizer
(https://github.com/SamStudio8/dehumanizer)

Periscope Requirements
Periscope is a wrapper for a snakemake(Köster and Rahmann 2012) workflow with a
package written in python to implement read filtering and classification, and is provided with
a conda environment definition. It has been tested on a Dell XPS, core i9, 32gb ram, 1Tb
SSD running ubuntu 18.04 and was able to process ~100,000 reads per minute. Periscope
installation requires conda (For example Miniconda,
https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html, version 3.7 or 3.8). To run periscope, you will
need the path to your raw fastq files from your ARTIC Network Nanopore sequencing run or
Illumina paired end reads (unfiltered), and other variables defined in the Supplementary
Material and on the github README.

Data Access
All raw sequencing data generated in this study have been submitted to the European
Nucleotide Archive under study ID: PRJEB40972.
